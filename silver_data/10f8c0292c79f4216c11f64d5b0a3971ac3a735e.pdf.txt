Numerous gels with unique physical properties have been synthesized and are widely used in our daily lives . However , all of these gels contain a substantial level of structural defects , as detected by scattering measurements . Despite the tremendous efforts made in recent decades to remove imperfections from gels , discernible signs of spatial defects have been persistently observed in gels . Researchers believe that gels are inherently heterogeneous . In this focus review , I brie ﬂ y introduce a recent ﬁ nding from our research group ’ s efforts to fabricate polymer gels free of spatial heterogeneities . The commonly observed scattering pro ﬁ les for the spatial defects disappeared in the homogeneous gels . The newly observed scattering pro ﬁ les are a benchmark for gel structures . Introduction Gels are soft - elastic materials used in various applications , spanning from cutting - edge biomedical applications and electronic devices to food industries [ 1 – 7 ] . The unique physical behaviors of gels , such as high deformability [ 8 , 9 ] , solvent retaining capability [ 10 – 12 ] , size ﬁ ltration effects [ 13 – 15 ] , and volume phase transition behaviors [ 16 – 18 ] , originate from their three - dimensional polymer net - works [ 19 , 20 ] . The gels are synthesized by crosslinking polymer chains dissolved in a solvent [ 19 , 21 – 25 ] ; in some cases , polymerization and crosslinking occur simulta - neously [ 26 , 27 ] . The developed three - dimensional cross - linked polymers eventually percolate the whole solution and change the system from a ﬂ uid “ sol ” to a solid “ gel ” [ 20 , 24 , 28 , 29 ] . Because the polymer chains continually ﬂ uctuate in the solution [ 30 – 32 ] , the crosslinking reaction tends to result in a complicated network with substantial defects [ 33 , 34 ] , including dangling ends , loops , entangle - ments , and nonuniform crosslinker distribution . These defects cause weak mechanical properties [ 35 ] , low transparency [ 36 ] , and abnormal swelling / deswelling behavior [ 37 ] , which limits the understanding of gel physics and the applications of the gels . Quantifying the defects is challenging because no technique can directly observe the raw polymer network in real space with suf ﬁ cient temporal / spatial resolutions along with an acceptable signal - to - noise ratio . Therefore , gel network structures have been mostly studied using scattering measurements , such as light , X - ray , and neutron scattering , in Fourier space [ 16 , 17 , 23 , 38 – 48 ] . The scattering pro ﬁ les provide information about the spatial and temporal correlations between the polymer chains [ 39 , 41 , 44 , 49 – 58 ] . Famous signatures of the spatial defects detected by scattering measurements are fractal small - angle scattering [ 59 , 60 ] , stationary laser speckles [ 61 , 62 ] , and nonergodic dynamics [ 63 , 64 ] , re ﬂ ecting the nonuniform distribution of polymer chains in the gels , i . e . , spatial het - erogeneities [ 46 , 65 – 67 ] . These unique scattering behaviors have been observed in all polymer gels ; therefore , they are often regarded as the criteria of being gels [ 59 – 61 , 63 , 68 ] . Many attempts have been made to reduce the spatial heterogeneities in gels , such as by synthesizing gels from monodispersed polymer chains [ 69 ] , using a uniform crosslinking process , such as a photoreaction [ 70 ] , by lim - iting unfavorable intramolecular reactions via the A – B type cross - coupling of multiarmed star polymers [ 71 ] and even by crosslinking polymer chains with movable crosslinkers that can relax the spatial heterogeneities [ 72 ] . Nevertheless , discernible signs of imperfections have always been * Xiang Li x . li @ issp . u - tokyo . ac . jp 1 Institute for Solid State Physics , The University of Tokyo , Kashiwa , Chiba , Japan 1234567890 ( ) ; , : 1234567890 ( ) ; , : observed in gels [ 68 , 70 , 71 , 73 , 74 ] . Gels have been believed to be an inherently heterogeneous material . Our recent study broke this preconception : we presented a simple but universal scheme to fabricate gels with a highly ordered network [ 22 , 75 , 76 ] . Our strategy is to bring a geometric constraint into the pregel solution so that the polymer solution is always uniformly ﬁ lled with the starting polymer units throughout the gelation reaction . This gela - tion framework is known as “ bond - percolation ” in classical percolation theory [ 29 , 77 ] . The spatial and temporal het - erogeneity of the synthesized gel network is investigated in Fourier space using scattering techniques . Our gel did not show any signatures of heterogeneity : no stationary laser speckles , no anomalous small - angle scattering , and fully ergodic concentration ﬂ uctuation were observed . These results are entirely different from the widely accepted pic - ture of gels . Surprisingly , both the small - angle scattering pro ﬁ les and intensity correlation functions of our gels are identical to those of noncrosslinked pregel solutions . In this focus review , I would like to brie ﬂ y introduce the history of research into gel structures and then present our strategy to vastly reduce heterogeneous structures . General structures of gels Fractal small - angle scattering Figure 1a shows the small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) pro ﬁ les of an alginate gel [ 78 ] , where alginates were gra - dually crosslinked with calcium ions in an aqueous solution ( Fig . 1b ) . The scattering intensity I ( q ) increased at small q values ( q < 0 . 1 Å − 1 ) as the crosslinking proceeded , indi - cating the formation of some large structures in the gels that did not exist in the noncrosslinked alginate solution . q is the magnitude of the scattering vector , which is inversely pro - portional to the distance in real space . Note that we cannot observe these large structures if their local concentrations Fig . 1 SAXS and SANS pro ﬁ les of the conventional gels . a SAXS pro ﬁ les of alginate gels with different crosslinking densities [ 78 ] .

Li are the same as the surrounding system because there is no scattering contrast between the large structures and the surrounding system . For example , a sizeable dilute polymer cluster dissolved in a semidilute solution of the same polymers is invisible for typical scattering measurements [ 24 , 28 , 30 , 45 ] . Therefore , the fractal small - angle scattering pro ﬁ les in the gels indicate that the observed large structures have a higher or lower local concentration than the sur - rounding gel network . The apparent fractal dimension D , e . g . , I ~ q − D , contains both the mass fractal dimension and the size distribution of the heterogeneous structures . The value of D varies widely from 0 . 5 to 4 [ 73 , 79 – 81 ] , sug - gesting the complexity of the gel networks . Figure 1c shows similar scattering pro ﬁ les for a poly ( N - isopropylacrylamide ) ( PNIPAM ) gel [ 82 ] synthesized by the copolymerization of N - isopropylacrylamide ( monomers ) and bisacrylamide ( crosslinkers ) . The pro ﬁ les of the PNIAPM gel and the uncrosslinked PNIPAM solution were similar at low crosslinking ratios . However , as more crosslinkers were introduced into the gels , fractal small - angle scattering became more dominant . Fractal small - angle scattering is a common feature of gels . The representative size of the spatial heterogeneity is generally larger than the observation range of general SAXS and SANS instruments ( ~ 200 nm ) . When the structures are smaller than ~ 1 µm , we can use static light scattering ( SLS ) to determine the size of the spatial heterogeneity [ 83 ] . The swelling of the gels typically induces additional spatial heterogeneity in the gel network that is attributed to connectivity heterogeneity , resulting an enhanced fractal small - angle scattering [ 84 ] . Stationary laser speckles Figure 2a shows a 2D laser speckle image of a polystyrene gel swollen in cyclohexane at a temperature where cyclohexane is a good solvent for polystyrene [ 85 ] . The speckle pattern was recorded for an extended period , e . g . , 30 s ; this is a time period in which polymers typically achieve complete relaxation . Therefore , the maxima and minima of the scattering intensity in the image re ﬂ ect the nonuniform and time - independent frozen distribution of the polymer chains [ 65 , 86 ] . The frozen components are attributed to the spatial heterogeneities observed in the SAXS and SANS pro ﬁ les . Note that in typical SAXS and SANS experiments , we do not see these speckles on the 2D scattering pro ﬁ les because the beam coherence of conven - tional X - rays and neutrons are insuf ﬁ cient to visualize the speckles . Instead , general SAXS or SANS experiments yield an ensemble - averaged scattering intensity , which corresponds to the spatially averaged intensity of the laser speckle pattern ( in a different q - region ) . Figure 2b shows the 1D laser speckle patterns from a PVA gel [ 61 ] . A bifunctional acid , Congo red , physically crosslinked the PVA . The gel is stable at room temperature but changes to a solution at high temperatures due to the dissociation of the Congo red from PVA . 1D speckle patterns were measured by recording the light scattering intensities at 100 different randomly chosen sample positions . The intensity depends strongly on the sample positions , indicating the variety of the local gel networks at each sample position . The laser speckles in PVA gel have weaker ﬂ uctuations at high temperatures , suggesting that the gel networks become more uniform . This tendency is attributed to the decrease in the crosslinking density in the PVA gels at higher tem - peratures . When the PVA gel changed into a solution at 57 °C , the laser speckles disappeared entirely . < I > E in Fig . 2b is the averaged scattering intensity over the 100 sample positions . As explained above , this intensity corresponds to the intensities observed in the SAXS and SANS pro ﬁ les at the q - range for visible light .

As the crosslinking proceeded , two relaxation modes appeared in g ( 2 ) ( τ ) − 1 ( curve 2 ) . The fast mode cor - responds to the concentration ﬂ uctuation , a universal relaxation mode for semidilute polymer solutions and gels . The slow mode shows the translational dynamics of some large hetero - geneous structures , whose local polymer concentration is dif - ferent from the surrounding gel network . As the crosslinking proceeded further ( curves 3 – 5 ) , the relaxation of the slow mode became even slower by a few orders of magnitude , suggesting the growth of large heterogeneities and an increase in the solution viscosity . After the gel was formed ( curves 6 – 7 ) , the value of the intensity correlation function at zero lag time , g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) − 1 , greatly decreased , suggesting the appearance of immobilized polymers . It can be slightly dif ﬁ cult to understand , but the immobilized polymers are not the gel network itself but the heterogeneous structures trapped in the gel network . When a spatially homogeneous gel is formed , g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) − 1 does not decrease at the gel point [ 75 ] . Although the decrease in g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) − 1 is not directly attributed to the gel network [ 75 ] , the decrease point matches the gel point [ 87 ] because the immobilization of the spatial heterogeneities occurs when the incipient gel network is formed . A similar decrease in g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) − 1 at the gel point was also observed when the nanoparticles were trapped in the gel networks [ 24 , 28 ] , supporting the discussion mentioned above . Note that the formation of immobilized voids [ 76 ] , i . e . , where no polymer chains exist , also leads to decreased g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) − 1 [ 76 ] . Figure 3b shows the intensity correlation functions , G ( t ) − 1 , in a PNI - PAM gel measured at a ﬁ xed scattering angle but at four different sample positions , noted with different X values [ 64 ] . The notation G ( t ) − 1 is the same with g ( 2 ) ( τ ) − 1 . X is the scattering intensity ratio of the dynamic term , I F / I T , calculated with G ( 0 ) − 1 = X ( 2 − X ) based on the partial heterodyne model . I F is the intensity from the dynamic term , and I T is the total scattering intensity [ 88 ] . The intensity correlation func - tions depend strongly on the sample positions , indicating a large variety in the local structures . The observed relaxation on G ( t ) − 1 corresponds to the concentration ﬂ uctuation in the gel . The main cause of the variance of G ( t ) − 1 at each sample position is the presence of “ frozen ” spatial heterogeneities , which differ at each position . Towards homogeneous gels A – B type end - crosslinking Figure 4a shows a gel with a near - ideal network synthesized by end - crosslinking two types of four - armed polyethylene glycols ( tetraPEG ) with mutual reactive end groups [ 71 ] . The combination of the end groups can be NHS to amine [ 89 ] or maleimide to thiol [ 21 ] . Because A - type tetraPEG can only react with B - type tetraPEG , the intramolecular reaction , i . e . , the reaction within the same tetraPEG , should be entirely suppressed in this reaction system . In addition , as the branch point is located at the center of the star polymers , the mesh size of this gel should be highly uni - form . Such well - de ﬁ ned structures have enabled precise design and control of the physical properties of gels [ 90 – 97 ] . The SANS pro ﬁ les of tetraPEG gels show a plateau in the small - angle region up to q ~ 0 . 005 Å − 1 , indicating the high homogeneity of tetraPEG gels on a length scale smaller than ~ 100 nm ( Fig . 4b ) [ 73 ] . Because of the high homogeneity of tetraPEG gels , the mechanical properties of tetraPEG gels are also largely improved compared with Fig . 3 Dynamics of the polymer chains in conventional gels observed by dynamic light scattering . a Polymer dynamics in a gelatin gel during its gelation process [ 87 ] . Gelatin is a physical gel that changes from a solution to a gel by decreasing the temperature . The apparent sol – gel transition temperature is ~ 24 °C .

However , fractal small - angle scattering was observed by light scattering experiments , which cover a length scale of 100 nm – 1 µm ( Fig . 4b ) [ 73 ] , indicating that spatial defects with a size larger than a few hundred nanometers exist in the tetraPEG gels . The ﬂ uc - tuating 1D laser speckle pattern of the tetraPEG gels also suggests a certain amount of frozen spatial heterogeneity in the gel network ( Fig . 4c ) [ 99 ] . The formation of hetero - geneous clusters and their immobilization were also observed in tetraPEG gel ( Fig . 4d ) [ 99 ] . Movable crosslinkers Figure 5 shows a unique polymer gel with movable cross - linkers , known as slide ring gels [ 72 ] . The linear polymer chains were tied up together by a pair of connected rings in the shape of the number 8 . The ends of the linear polymers are capped with large molecules to prevent the rings from slipping out from the chains . The rings can slide through the polymer chains even after the gel network forms ; therefore , the movable crosslinkers enable the local rearrangement of the gel network and reduce the nonuniform distribution of polymer chains formed by the stochastic crosslinking reaction . The mechanical properties of the gels were dras - tically improved by the movable crosslinkers [ 9 ] . The gels can be stretched to more than ten times their original length . However , scattering experiments revealed that a certain amount of spatial heterogeneity exists even in these gels ( Fig . 5b , c ) [ 100 ] . Similar heterogeneous cluster formation and immobilization were observed in the DLS intensity correlation functions ( Fig . 5d ) [ 100 ] . Bond percolation condition Instead of improving the crosslinking reaction as performed in previous studies , we chose a different direction to achieve homogeneous gels [ 75 ] . We focused on the packing con - ditions of the polymer chains in the pregel solution . We brought a geometric constraint into the polymer chains so Fig . 4 Near - ideal gel networks synthesized by A – B type end - crosslinking of mutually reactive four - armed polyethylene glycols [ 40 , 71 ] . a The schematic of the tetra - PEG gel [ 104 ] . b Scattering intensity pro ﬁ les of tetra - PEG gels synthesized at different polymer volume fractions ( ϕ ) in aqueous buffer [ 73 ] .

Reprinted from [ 99 ] with permission from Elsevier A benchmark for gel structures : bond percolation enables the fabrication of extremely homogeneous gels 769 that the polymer solution was always uniformly ﬁ lled with the starting polymer units throughout the gelation reaction . Our strategy was based on the “ bond - percolation ” model [ 77 ] , which is a classical percolation model [ 29 ] . The bond percolation model divides the space of the polymer solution into a collection of small sites . The model assumes that mutually exclusive polymer units prepack all these sites , and the crosslinking reaction occurs between nearby units . The polymer units may exchange their positions in the gelation reaction , but the polymer units always pack all the sites throughout the gelation reaction . As long as the polymer units are exclusive , i . e . , they do not allow other polymer units to interpenetrate their occupied sites , a highly ordered , ideal network structure is expected to form . There are four essential points to achieve perfect bond percolation conditions . First , multiarmed star polymers , e . g . , tetraPEG , were used as a space - ﬁ lling unit ( Fig . 6a ) . The multiarmed star polymers show a strong excluded volume effect to prevent other polymer units from inter - penetrating into their own pervaded volume . Second , the polymers were dissolved at a concentration higher than its chain overlapping limit , c * . The optimally crowded condi - tion ensures that the polymer units uniformly ﬁ ll up the space . When the polymer concentration is too high , entan - glements between the polymer units may result in a non - uniform spatial polymer distribution . Third , a solvent with an excellent af ﬁ nity for the polymer units was used . A low af ﬁ nity between the solvent and polymer may result in polymer aggregates , which breaks the bond percolation conditions , i . e . , one site , one polymer unit . Finally , a ﬁ ne syringe ﬁ lter was used to remove dust and nanobubbles from the solution as much as possible . Impurities disturb the Fig . 5 Rearrangeable gel network synthesized by crosslinking PEG with movable crosslinkers . a Schematic of the slide ring gels [ 105 ] . b Small - angle neutron scattering pro ﬁ le of the slide ring gels in 1 N NaOD [ 100 ] .

Although all these sug - gestions had already been mentioned separately in previous studies , they had not been resolved altogether . We synthesized gels by crosslinking tetraPEG with active ester end groups with a small bifunctional cross - lin - ker , 1 , 14 - diamino - 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 - tetraoxatetradecane ( amino - PEG4 - amine ) , in dehydrated acetonitrile , which is a good solvent for PEG . The solvent quality was determined by con ﬁ rming no aggregation formation in the pregel solution using DLS . Detailed information for the gel synthesis and DLS test is described in our previous articles [ 75 , 76 ] . Figure 6b shows the synthesized “ bond percolation ” gel in a glass tube .

The gel point was determined as the point where the storage modulus and loss modulus crossed during dynamic viscoelasticity measurement A benchmark for gel structures : bond percolation enables the fabrication of extremely homogeneous gels 771 ( Fig . 6c ) . No stationary laser speckles were observed in the “ bond percolation ” gel ( Fig . 6d ) , indicating the high homogeneity of the bond percolation gel . In contrast , numerous bright and dark spots , i . e . , laser speckles , were observed in the conventional gels ( Fig . 6e ) . Figure 6f shows the scattering pro ﬁ les of the bond percolation gel and the corresponding uncrosslinked polymer solution ( sol ) . The scattering pro ﬁ les of the gel and sol overlap each other well , and fractal scattering at small q values ( q < < 0 . 1 Å − 1 ) was not observed ( Fig . 6f ) . The perfect consistency between the gel and sol pro ﬁ les at small q values suggests that no spatial heterogeneities existed in the bond percolation gel . There are a few studies showing similar no excess scattering pro ﬁ les for gels , but the no excess scattering region was limited in the q - range of typical SAXS and SANS setups ( q > 5 × 10 − 3 Å − 1 ) and only for sparsely crosslinked gels [ 84 ] . In contrast , in Fig . 6f , we exhibited , for the ﬁ rst time , no excess scattering even in the light scattering region , q > 5 × 10 − 4 Å − 1 , and at a high crosslinking ratio . Figure 6g shows the intensity correlation functions ( g 2 ) of the bond perco - lation gel during its gelation process . Note that g 2 , g ( 2 ) ( τ ) , and G ( t ) are all notations for intensity correlation functions . All g 2 curves fell on a single relaxation curve ; there was no change in the intensity correlation functions in the bond percolation gel regardless of the extent of crosslinking , even at the gel point . The gel point of the bond percolation gel was separately determined by a dynamic viscoelasticity measurement . We used the cross point of the storage modulus and the loss modulus of the sample as the gel point . The scattering pro ﬁ les of a homogeneous gel are very simple and entirely different from those of any other gel , as introduced above . When the bond percolation breaks To con ﬁ rm the importance of the assumptions we made for the ideal bond percolation condition , we deliberately changed the packing state of the polymer units in the pregel solutions ( Fig . 7a – c ) . We used the same star polymers but lowered the polymer concentration below c * ( Fig . 7b ) or reduced the solvent af ﬁ nity ( Fig . 7c ) . The low polymer concentration condition is an under ﬁ lled state , where gela - tion proceeds by site percolation or site - bond percolation . Gel networks containing nanovoids are expected to be formed in the under ﬁ lled state ( Fig . 7e ) . In contrast , the low - af ﬁ nity solvent condition will result in polymer aggregates . Although the polymer units ﬁ ll all the sites in the pregel solution , some sites will be over ﬁ lled with mul - tiple polymer units ( Fig . 7c ) . We refer to the over ﬁ lled condition as the “ nonideal bond percolation ” condition . We used water as the low - af ﬁ nity solvent for the PEG star polymers . Gel networks with locally dense regions are expected to form under this packing condition ( Fig . 7f ) . Panels g – i in Fig . 7 show the corresponding 2D laser speckle images of the gels synthesized under bond perco - lation , site percolation , and nonideal bond percolation conditions . Bright and dark interference spots were observed exclusively in the site and nonideal bond perco - lation gels , suggesting the presence of spatial defects in these gels , as we expected . We can quantitatively assess the extent of the spatial distribution by measuring the polymer dynamics . While all g ( 2 ) T ( τ ) − 1 curves of the bond perco - lation gel overlap well with each other , the g ( 2 ) T ( τ ) − 1 curves of the site percolation and nonideal bond percolation gels vary , depending on the sample positions . This result suggests the presence of frozen spatial heterogeneities in the nonbond - percolation gels . g ( 2 ) T ( τ ) − 1 did not start from 1 due to the instrumentation factors [ 101 ] . For the site per - colation and nonideal percolation gels , the ensemble - averaged intensity correlation functions g ( 2 ) E ( τ ) − 1 did not fully relax even at the long lag time , indicating the presence of “ frozen ” heterogeneities in the gels . The “ fro - zen ” spatial defects in the site percolation gel should be voids , which do not ﬂ uctuate with time . By contrast , the “ frozen ” spatial defects in the nonideal bond percolation gel should be local aggregates trapped in the gel network . To identify the size and volume fraction of the defects in each gel , we further analyzed the gels using SLS and SAXS . Figure 8 shows the normalized scattering pro ﬁ les of three different gels [ 76 ] . The scattering intensity I ( q ) and scat - tering vector q are corrected based on the Ornstein – Zernike ( OZ ) model to normalize the contribution of the con - centration ﬂ uctuations on the scattering pro ﬁ les [ 102 , 103 ] . While the region q ξ > 1 corresponds to a length scale that is smaller than the size of the concentration ﬂ uctuation , the region q ξ < 1 shows a spatial correlation longer than the screening length of the concentration ﬂ uctuation . The scattering curves for all three gels overlap with each other when q ξ > 1 , suggesting successful normalization . The solid curves show good ﬁ tting using the OZ model function , which describes the scattering originating from concentra - tion ﬂ uctuations of semidilute polymer chains . While the single OZ function can reproduce the normalized scattering pro ﬁ les of the bond percolation gel , the scattering pro ﬁ les of the site percolation and nonideal bond percolation gels deviated from the OZ curves at small q values ( q ξ < 1 ) . The consistency between the scattering pro ﬁ le and OZ function indicates that no additional spatial correlations are formed by gelation . In contrast , the pro ﬁ les that deviated from the OZ function suggest the presence of spatial heterogeneities . In previous studies , the type of spatial heterogeneity was hard to determine because both sparse regions ( voids ) and dense regions ( aggregates ) tend to be formed during the gelation process . However , as we started from a highly homogeneous gel and deliberately deviated the packing 772 X .

Copyright 2020 American Chemical Society A benchmark for gel structures : bond percolation enables the fabrication of extremely homogeneous gels 773 conditions of the prepolymers , we could estimate the type of spatial heterogeneity in these gels well . The typical sizes of these spatial heterogeneities were estimated using the Gui - nier equation , which is a versatile equation to calculate the z - average gyration radius of objects with arbitrary shapes . The size of the spatial heterogeneities , i . e . , nanovoids , in the site percolation gel was estimated to be R g = 7 . 1 nm , approximately twice the star polymer units , R g = 3 . 5 nm . The total volume fraction of the spatial heterogeneities was roughly estimated to be ~ 26 vol % determined from the scattering intensity of the heterogeneities . In contrast , the heterogeneities size in the nonideal bond percolation gel was ~ 54 nm , which is much larger than the size of the polymer units . The volume fraction of the aggregates was estimated to be ~ 5 vol % , and the local concentration of the aggregates was only 10 % higher than the polymer con - centration in the gel network . In the nonideal bond perco - lation gel , large but very loose aggregates were trapped in the gel network . Summary and future perspective Our ﬁ ndings demonstrate that the heterogeneity may not be an inherent nature of the gels . The scattering pro ﬁ les from the bond percolation gel established a new benchmark for future gel structure analysis . The key point in fabricating homogeneous gels lies in the packing state of the polymers in the pregel solution . The simplicity of our gel preparation scheme will enable us to synthesize homogeneous gels with a highly ordered network from a variety of polymers with different chemical structures and functionalities , which will lead to a wide range of new applications .
