Several important discoveries in growth cone cell biology were made possible by the use of growth cones derived from cultured Aplysia bag cell neurons , including the characterization of the organization and dynamics of the cytoskeleton . The majority of these Aplysia studies focused on large growth cones induced by poly - L - lysine substrates at early stages in cell culture . Under these conditions , thegrowthconesareinasteadystatewithverylittlenetadvancement . Here , weofferacomprehensivecellularanalysisof the motile behavior of Aplysia growth cones in culture beyond this pausing state . We found that average growth cone size decreased with cell culture time whereas average growth rate increased . This inverse correlation of growth rate and growth cone size was due to the occurrence of large growth cones with a peripheral domain larger than 100 ùúá m 2 . The large pausing growth cones had central domains that were less consistently aligned with the direction of growth and could be converted into smaller , faster - growing growth cones by addition of a three - dimensional collagen gel . We conclude that the significant lateral expansion of lamellipodia and filopodia as observed during these culture conditions has a negative effect on neurite growth . 1 . Introduction The neuronal growth cone is the motile tip of the neurite and an important mediator of neural plasticity [ 1 ‚Äì 3 ] . It directs axons and dendrites to their respective targets during neural development and regeneration , by sensing and responding to a multitude of both chemical and physical cues [ 4 , 5 ] . As a result of the extreme sensitivity of growth cones to their environment , dramatic variation in morphology and motility of the same growth cone has often been observed in vivo , reflecting the complex nature of the microenvironment [ 6 ‚Äì 8 ] . Cell culture provides an alternative to study the behavior of growth cones in a defined experimental setting [ 9 ‚Äì 11 ] . Cultured neurons retain the ability to form neurites as well as axons and dendrites [ 9 , 10 , 12 , 13 ] . The growth cones formed in vitro are characterized by three domains : ( 1 ) the peripheral ( P ) domain , which includes both filopodial and lamellipodial extensions at the distal edge ; ( 2 ) the central ( C ) domain , which is rich in organelles and vesicles and bridges the P domain of growth cone and the newly formed neurite shaft ; and ( 3 ) the transition ( T ) zone between P and C domain , often bearing membrane ruffles [ 1 , 2 , 5 ] . This domain assignment is a general feature of growth cones , whereas the relative size and shape of individual domains for a given growth cone vary greatly depending on species , cell type , and culture condition . In a complete cycle of neurite outgrowth , the protrusion of filopodia and lamellipodia in the P domain of growth cone is followed by the invasion of microtubule bundles , organelles , and vesicles into the P domain ( engorgement ) and the conversion of the growth cone neck into a new segment of the neurite ( consolidation ) [ 5 , 14 ‚Äì 16 ] . The bag cell neuron from the sea slug Aplysia californica is one of the most extensively used model systems for investiga - tions involving electrophysiology [ 17 ‚Äì 19 ] , neuropeptide syn - thesis and secretion [ 17 , 20 ‚Äì 22 ] , neuronal motility and guid - ance [ 23 , 24 ] , cytoskeletal dynamics [ 25 ‚Äì 29 ] , and cellular bio - physics [ 30 ‚Äì 32 ] . The preference for Aplysia bag cell neurons results in part from the large cell body ( ‚àº 50 ùúá m diameter ) and Hindawi Publishing Corporation Neural Plasticity Volume 2016 , Article ID 3497901 , 13 pages http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1155 / 2016 / 3497901 2 Neural Plasticity the large growth cone in cell culture , especially when plated on poly - L - lysine - ( PLL - ) coated coverslips ( ‚àº 1000 ùúá m 2 total growth cone surface area ) . Comparatively , vertebrate neu - ronal growth cones are typically smaller than 100 ùúá m 2 . This 10x increase in size is advantageous not only for quantitative high - resolution analysis of numerous growth cone activities [ 27 , 28 , 33 , 34 ] , but also for various biophysical manipulations [ 29 , 30 ] . Not surprisingly , several key findings regarding growth cone morphology and dynamics were made in studies using Aplysia bag cell neuronal growth cones , thanks to the advantages provided by both the large size and the stereotypic domain organization [ 23 ‚Äì 25 , 30 , 35 ] . In addition , the orga - nized geometry of the Aplysia growth cone is an attractive tar - get for modeling of growth cone dynamics and motility [ 36 ] . Despite the pivotal role that Aplysia bag cell neuronal growth cone played in cellular neurobiology , a basic description of growth cone behavior in vivo has been missing due to challenges in breeding and imaging developing Aplysia [ 37 , 38 ] . In previous in vitro studies involving Aplysia bag cell neurons , no staging of growth cone development has been performed as it has been done for hippocampal neurons [ 10 ] or Aplysia buccal ganglion cell neurons developing normally [ 14 ] or after axotomy [ 39 ] . Instead , almost all previous studies involving Aplysia bag cell growth cones have focused on large growth cones on PLL substrates and short - term motility at steady state , during which neither significant growth nor retraction occurred . Accounts of bag cell growth cones show - ing significant advancement are rare , and the growth rate was usually lower than that of other types of growth cones , unless neurons were stimulated by apCAM substrates [ 24 , 30 , 33 , 34 ] or plated on hemolymph with or without laminin [ 31 , 40 ] . It is unclear whether the pausing state of large growth cones is due to intrinsic properties or due to limiting factors presented by the culture environment or both . In this study , we provide a detailed analysis of the behav - ior of Aplysia bag cell growth cones beyond the large , pausing state typically observed in culture . We show that average size of growth cone decreased with increasing cell culture time , whereas average growth rate increased . We found that this inverse correlation was due to the occurrence of large growth cones ( with P domains larger than 100 ùúá m 2 ) at early stages of cell culture and that large growth cones usually had minimal growth rate ( less than 2 ùúá m / h ) . C domains of large growth cones were less aligned with the direction of growth when compared to C domains of smaller , fast - growing cones . Large growth cones were formed on two - dimensional ( 2D ) PLL substrates by lamellipodial veils connecting numerous filopodia . Furthermore , we found that large growth cones could exit the pausing state either by branching or by applica - tion of a type I collagen gel on top of the growth cone . These findings suggest that widely spread growth cones as found on 2D PLL substrates are not conducive to fast neurite growth . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Cell Culture . Bag cell neurons from adult Aplysia cal - ifornica ( 200 g , Marinus Scientific , Long Beach , CA ) were harvested as described previously [ 11 ] . Cells were cultured on acid - cleaned coverslip or glass - bottom dishes ( MatTek Cor - poration , Ashland , MA ) coated with 20 ùúá g / mL PLL ( 70 ‚Äì 150 kD ; Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . L15 ( Invitrogen ; Life Tech - nologies , Grand Island , NY ) supplemented with artificial sea water ( ASW ) was used as culture media ( L15 - ASW : L15 plus 400 mM NaCl , 9 mM CaCl 2 , 27 mM MgSO 4 , 28 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM L - glutamine , 50 ùúá g / mL gentamicin , and 5 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 9 , osmolarity 950 ‚Äì 1000 ) . Cells were kept at 14 ‚àò C except for when imaged on the microscope . 2 . 2 . Imaging . Live cell imaging was performed at room temperature in L15 - ASW on a Nikon TE2000 E2 inverted microscope ( Nikon , Melville , NY ) with 60x oil immersion objective lens , with additional 1 . 5x magnification . Focus dur - ing long time - lapse sequences was maintained with the Nikon Perfect Focus system . Images were collected with a Cascade II charge - coupled device camera ( Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) controlled by MetaMorph 7 . 8 software ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Imaging chamber was assembled as previ - ously reported for cells cultured on coverslip [ 41 ] , and fresh L15 - ASW was supplemented for imaging longer than 1 h . For cells cultured on glass - bottom dish , fresh medium was exchanged every hour . Time - lapse series were acquired at 30 s intervals for 3 . 5 h ( Figure 4 ( a ) ) ; 60 s intervals for 3 h ( Figure 4 ( b ) ) ; 120 s intervals for 13 h ( Figure 5 ( a ) ) ; and 30 s intervals for 3 h ( Figure 6 ( g ) ) . 2 . 3 . Neurite Growth Rate and Growth Cone Size Analysis . Neurites were identified and imaged at different time points after cell plating : between 24 and 27 h ; between 48 and 51 h ; and between 72 and 75 h after cell plating . MetaMorph 7 . 8 software was used for image analysis . To determine individual neurite growth rates , the displacement of a neurite tip over a three - hour interval ( 3 . 5 h for Figure 2 ) was measured and divided by the time . P domain size was measured and used to correlate with the growth rate of an individual growth cone . To account for different shape and domain organization of big and small growth cones , only the P domain directly in front of C domain was included . Specifically , the center of the C domain was determined , which served as the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system superimposed on the growth cone with the ùë¶ - axis in the direction of growth cone advance . Only the area of the P domain that was in front of the ùë• - axis was included in the size measurements . 2 . 4 . 2D - 3D Transition Culture . Cells were cultured on PLL - coated coverslips for 24 h to allow for the formation of growth cones , and then an imaging chamber was assembled . Liquid 2 mg / mL type I rat tail collagen ( Corning , Corning , NY ) based gel mixture ( containing 25 % Aplysia hemolymph [ 40 ] and 20 ùúá g / mL PLL ) was introduced into the chamber on top of the cells and allowed to solidify at 37 ‚àò C for 1 h . The imaging chamber was placed back into dishes with L15 - ASW for continued cell culture at RT , until chambers were mounted for imaging . Cells cultured in this setup maintain a healthy morphology for at least 10 d . 2 . 5 . Statistics . Graphs were made in GraphPad Prism 6 ( GraphPad Software , Inc . , La Jolla , CA ) . Mann - Whitney test Neural Plasticity 3 ( Figures 1 and 6 ) or Dunn‚Äôs test ( Figure 3 ) was used following normality testing to compare the P domain sizes and growth rates of different groups . Since P domain and growth cone size data was not normally distributed and varied over a wide range , we used a log scale and whisker plots with the box representing the 25th and 75th percentile , middle line indicat - ing the median , and whiskers representing the min and max values . Significance was established at ùëÉ < 0 . 05 . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Aplysia Growth Cones Become Smaller with Time in Cul - ture . Previous studies on Aplysia bag cell neuronal growth cones have mainly focused on large fan - shaped specimens cultured for one or two days on PLL substrates [ 24 , 27 , 28 , 33 , 34 ] . Such growth cones exhibit not only distinct organization of cytoplasmic domains but also a highly organized actin and microtubule cytoskeleton with well - characterized dynamic properties . However , the vast majority of these growth cones do not significantly translocate during a typical observation time of 30 to 60 min . Here , we compared the sizes of growth cones from cultured bag cell neuron on PLL - coated coverslips at different times in culture . At 18 h after plating , multiple large growth cones with a diameter between 50 and 100 ùúá m appeared around the cell body . These growth cones share stereotypic organization , with a flat P domain and organelle - rich C domain separated by the T zone that features extensive membrane ruffles ( Figure 1 ( a ) ) . By 78 h , growth cones moved further away from the cell body and were considerably smaller in size . The smaller growth cones had fewer filopodia and a less obvious T zone ( Figure 1 ( a ) ) . The portion of the filopodia extending beyond the leading edge became pro - portionally longer compared to the portion of the filopodia embedded in the lamellipodia ( arrow in the lower right image ) . Statistical analysis revealed a wide distribution of P domain size at both time points ( note the log scale ) , as well as a significant drop of the average P domain size at 78 h when compared to the 18 h time point ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) . 3 . 2 . Large Growth Cones Tend to Have Lower Growth Rates . In order to test if growth cone size has an impact on growth rate , we took images of individual growth cones on the second day of plating , at 3 . 5 h interval ( at 53 h and 56 . 5 h after plating ) . As can be seen from Figure 2 ( a ) , the large growth cone exhibited minimal advancement within 3 . 5 h , while the two smaller growth cones translocated 45 and 50 ùúá m , respectively , over the same period of time . A plot of growth cone advance rate versus P domain size indicated a nonlinear correlation , with the highest growth rate at around 50 ùúá m 2 and a decline of growth rate for growth cones with P domain larger than 100 ùúá m 2 ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) . Growth cones with P domains smaller than 100 ùúá m 2 did not show a clear correlation between size and advance rate ( inset in Figure 2 ( b ) ) . Growth cones with P domains larger than 200 ùúá m 2 were less abundant and usually had growth rates of less than 2 ùúá m / h . In conclusion , our results show that large growth cones tend to grow slowly , whereas small growth cones do not have a clear correlation between size and advance rate . 3 . 3 . Neurite Growth Rate Increases with Time in Culture as Growth Cone Size Decreases . Prompted by the findings that growth cone size decreases with increased cell culture time and that larger growth cones exhibit lower growth rates , we set out to test whether an increase in growth rate can be observed at later time points of cell culture . To this end , images of individual growth cones were taken at 3 h intervals at 24 , 48 , and 72 h after cell plating ( Figure 3 ( a ) ) . As predicted , we observed a significant decrease in average P domain size , concomitant with a significant increase in average growth rate with time in culture ( Figures 3 ( b ) and 3 ( c ) ) . Plots of growth rate versus P domain size for individual growth cones , however , showed a nonlinear correlation ( Figure 3 ( d ) ) in agreement with data shown in Figure 2 ( b ) . These plots revealed that the P domain size is a poor predictor of growth rate for individual growth cones with P domain size smaller than 50 ùúá m 2 ; however , it becomes a better predictor for larger growth cones , since 100 % of growth cones with P domain size larger than 100 ùúá m 2 have small growth rate ( less than 2 ùúá m / h ) . In summary , the decreased percentage of large growth cones at later time points of cell culture accounts for the increase in average neurite growth rate with time in culture . At later times in culture , the majority of neurite outgrowth was carried out by smaller growth cones with P domain size of less than 50 ùúá m 2 . 3 . 4 . Large and Small Growth Cones Show Different C Domain and T Zone Dynamics . In order to identify other differences between large and small growth cones besides size that might explain their different growth rates , we used high - resolution live cell imaging over the time course of 3 h to study their motile behavior . In agreement with previous findings ( Figure 2 ) , growth cones with P domains larger than 100 ùúá m 2 rarely showed net advancement ( Figure 4 ( a ) ; Video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1155 / 2016 / 3497901 ) . These large , fan - shaped growth cones exhibited swaying of the C domain that terminates at membrane ruffles‚Äîalso referred to as intrapodia‚Äîin the T zone [ 42 ] and a gradual decrease in the extent of membrane ruffles in the T zone over time . In contrast to the large growth cones , small , motile growth cones advanced by protruding lamellipodia between newly formed filopodia , while avoiding the formation of a large fan - shaped P domain ( Figure 4 ( a ) , small growth cone on the right ; Figure 4 ( b ) ; Video 2 ) . Fur - thermore , in smaller growth cones , the C domain followed more consistently the base of filopodia and maintained its directionality better than in large growth cones ( Figure 4 ( b ) ; Video 2 ) . We measured the angle ùõº between the mean orien - tation of the C domain boundary and the direction of growth cone advancement as an indicator for the persistency of the C domain advancement and engorgement ( Figure 4 ( c ) ) . We found that large , pausing growth cones frequently showed swaying of the mean C domain orientation along with splitting of the C domain , suggesting that persistent C domain advance could be more challenging for large growth cones ( Figure 4 ( c ) ) . On the other hand , small advancing growth cones exhibited a more persistent orientation of the C domain . After spending a significant amount of time 4 Neural Plasticity P C T 18h 78h ( a ) 18 78 1 10 100 1000 10000 P d o m a i n s i z e ( ùúá m 2 ) ‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó ( h ) ( b ) Figure 1 : Growth cone size decreases between 18 and 78h in cell culture .

( typically more than 3 h ) in the pausing state , a large growth cone either completely retracted or retracted some of its P domain to form smaller growth cones . In this way , large growth cones gave rise to new neurites through branching from their original P domains ( Figure 4 ( d ) ) . In summary , the persistent advance of the C domain is more common in small growth cones and may contribute to the faster growth of small growth cones when compared to large fan - shaped growth cones . 3 . 5 .

In this example , two growth cones ( GC1 and GC2 , indicated at the 2 h time point ) formed within 2 h of cell plating from a proximal neurite that remained following dissection of the ganglion ( Figure 5 ( a ) ; time point 0 h is immediately after cell plating ; Video 3 ) . The nascent growth cones advanced both by protrusion of filopodia and by ‚Äúveillike‚Äù lamellipodia in - between filopodia . The growth rate fluctuated and was as high as 15 ùúá m / h . The expansion of lamellipodial veils eventually connected all filopodia , which formed a uniform array of spikes in the fan - shaped P domain of large growth cone 1 ( GC1 ) at the 7 h time point . The flattening of both P domain and T zone coincided with the loss of growth cone motility in both large GC1 and small GC2 ( red and black arrow in Fig - ure 5 ( b ) ) . By 7 h after plating , both growth cones reached the pausing state and resembled the larger growth cone shown in Figure 4 ( a ) . Whereas large GC1 never exited this pausing 6 Neural Plasticity 48h 24h 72h ( a ) ‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó ‚àó‚àó‚àó 1 10 100 1000 P d o m a i n s i z e ( ùúá m 2 ) 48 24 72 ( h ) ( b ) ‚àó‚àó‚àó‚àó ‚àó‚àó ‚àí 4 ‚àí 2 0 2 4 6 8 G r o w t h r a t e ( ùúá m / h ) 48 24 72 ( h ) ( c ) ‚àí 2 0 2 4 6 8 G r o w t h r a t e ( ùúá m / h ) ‚àí 4 ‚àí 2 0 2 4 6 8 G r o w t h r a t e ( ùúá m / h ) 400 600 800 200 P domain size ( ùúá m 2 ) 100 50 P domain size 48h 24h 72h P < 0 . 0001 r = ‚àí0 . 60 ( d ) Figure 3 : Neurite growth rates increase with decreasing growth cone size and time in culture .

Thus , the formation of flat P domain and T zone seems to be a hallmark of large , pausing growth cones . Furthermore , these observations suggest that local changes in actin and membrane dynamics need to occur in order to exit this pausing state . 3 . 6 . Collagen I - Based Gel Promotes Faster Outgrowth of Bag Cell Neuronal Growth Cones .

In an attempt to rescue large growth cones from this pausing state , we pro - vided them with an additional substrate support from the dorsal side . In doing so , we designed an anisotropic three - dimensional ( 3D ) collagen culture system . After growth cones had formed on PLL - coated coverslips , a layer of a collagen I - based gel containing 25 % Aplysia hemolymph [ 40 ] and 20 ùúá g / mL PLL was introduced on top of the neurons , and the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h ( Figure 6 ( a ) ) . This 2D - 3D transition in culture environment had a clear impact on the morphology of growth cones and promoted neurite outgrowth when compared to growth on 2D PLL sub - strates ( Figure 6 ( b ) ) . Figure 6 ( c ) shows a large growth cone on PLL before and after introduction of the collagen gel . Com - pared with the growth cone on plain PLL substrates , growth cones in 3D culture were consistently smaller and had less distinct domain separation ( Figures 6 ( c ) and 6 ( d ) ) . Average total growth cone size before gel application was 1238 ¬± 178 ùúá m 2 ( ùëõ = 37 ) and after gel application was 70 ¬± 24 ùúá m 2 ( ùëõ = 25 ; Figure 6 ( e ) ) . Time - lapse imaging of growth cones dynamics advancing at the 2D - 3D interface revealed mean growth rates of 13 . 4 ùúá m / h ( Figures 6 ( f ) and 6 ( g ) ; Video 4 ) . Addition of hemolymph to the collagen gel was critical to convert the large pausing growth cones to smaller advancing growth cones . However , we do not believe that the changes observed were solely due to hemolymph , since growth cones cultured on planar surfaces coated with PLL and hemolymph result in a morphological phenotype that is midway between growth cones grown on PLL and at the 2D - 3D interface [ 40 ] . The neurites formed after gel addition were more rounded and smooth , a sign of neurite consolidation ( Figures 6 ( d ) and 6 ( g ) ; Video 4 ) . These rounded neurites induced by the addition of 3D collagen gel were more similar to the preexist - ing neurite following dissection of the abdominal ganglion ( Figure 5 ( a ) ) and different from the more spread neurites generated on the plain PLL substrates ( Figure 4 ) . Therefore , application of the collagen gel promoted neurite outgrowth of bag cell neurons , possibly by providing substrate support on the dorsal side of the growth cone and triggering smaller growth cones . 4 . Discussion 4 . 1 . Stages of Neurite Outgrowth of Cultured Aplysia Bag Cell Neurons . Growth cones formed by Aplysia bag cell neuron cultured on PLL - coated solid surfaces have proven to be an excellent model system for the past 30 years , as it enabled seminal discoveries regarding the nature of F - actin retrograde flow [ 23 , 35 ] , substrate - cytoskeleton coupling [ 24 , 32 , 43 ] , microtubule and actin dynamics [ 27 , 28 , 33 , 34 ] , and cellular mechanotransduction [ 30 ‚Äì 32 ] . Common features of the growth cones analyzed in the aforementioned studies are large size ( typically with P domains larger than 100 ùúá m 2 ) , fan - shape , and clear domain distinction , the combination of which provides unique advantages especially for high - resolution measurements of cytoskeletal dynamics and cel - lular mechanics . While being a well - defined system , these large growth cones represent only one type among the diverse growth cone morphologies observed in vitro and in vivo . It is therefore necessary to investigate the motile behavior of bag cell growth cones beyond the typically reported shape to better compare findings made with different growth cone model systems . We believe that the basic mechanisms of how cytoskeletal dynamics is harnessed for growth cone motility and advance are highly conserved across different species and growth conditions . What varies among different growth cone systems , growth states , and conditions is the relative contribution of individual processes to net outgrowth , such as ( 1 ) actin assembly and recycling , ( 2 ) myosin activity , ( 3 ) adhe - sion and clutching , and ( 4 ) membrane delivery and recycling . Thus , the large , fan - shape Aplysia growth cone can be consid - ered a transient ‚Äúpausing growth cone , ‚Äù in which actin assem - bly and retrograde flow rates are well balanced [ 27 ] . It can exit this pausing stage through a new stimulus such as an adhesion protein - coated bead or needle [ 24 , 30 ] , by branching or introduction of a collagen gel ( this study ) as further discussed below . To achieve a more comprehensive assessment of the motile behavior of cultured bag cell growth cones , we ana - lyzed the morphology and motility of bag cell growth cones on PLL - coated coverslip at different time points in culture in an unbiased manner with respect to growth cone morphology and size and describe how the large growth cones develop over time . During the first 24 h after plating , multiple large , fan - shaped growth cones formed with P domains larger than 100 ùúá m 2 . These growth cones formed from preexisting neurites or de novo from the cell body . The large P domain was induced by multiple lamellipodial veils protruding and connecting an increasing number of filopodia ( Figure 5 ( a ) ; Video 3 ) . The formation of these large growth cones took about 3 ‚Äì 5 h , and they typically spent a significant amount of time ( more than 3 h ) in the pausing state ( Figure 4 ( a ) ; Video 1 ) . Large growth cones then typically branched into neurites with growth cones of smaller size between 24 and 72 h after plating ( Figures 1 , 3 , and 4 ( d ) ) . None of the neurites was morphologically distinct from others indicating that an axon cannot be distinguished from dendrites in bag cell neurites , which is not surprising considering that these cells primarily have neurosecretory function . Although a simple linear cor - relation between P domain size and growth rate for individual growth cones could not be established for all observed growth cones , a lower growth rate ( smaller than 2 ùúá m / h ) was usually found for large growth cones ( P domain size more than 100 ùúá m 2 ) , which is in agreement with previous study where instantaneous growth rates of large growth cones were mea - sured ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) [ 40 ] . Small growth cones can advance as fast as 10 ùúá m / h on PLL substrates in the absence of any additional growth promoting factors ( Figure 2 ( a ) ; Video 2 ) , suggesting the lower growth rate seen for large growth cones is likely due to the significant growth cone enlargement . When neurite outgrowth was promoted by either adding of hemolymph or plating on coverslips coated with hemo - lymph / laminin , a reduction in growth cone size could be readily observed [ 40 , 44 ] . Bag cell neurons plated on laminin / hemolymph - coated silicone gel also displayed smaller size and faster growth rate [ 31 ] . Thus , a smaller size seems to be a prerequisite for fast growth in the case of Aplysia bag cell Neural Plasticity 11 neuronal growth cones , whereas the large growth cones conventionally used for imaging cytoskeletal dynamics are representative of a pausing state . Because of this , one should therefore be careful when directly comparing absolute num - bers such as retrograde flow rates gained from pausing Aplysia bag cell neuronal growth cones with faster - growing growth cones derived from other species or when extrapolat - ing to growth cones in vivo . It will be interesting to investigate whether actin assembly and retrograde flow rates are different between large , pausing and small , advancing growth cones , in order to better understand the causal relationship between growth cone size and advance rate . A definite causal relation - ship between size and growth rate , however , could only be established if we would find a substrate - independent way to directly enlarge the size of fast moving Aplysia bag cell neuron growth cones . 4 . 2 . Large and Small Growth Cone Have Different C Domain Dynamics and Ruffling Activity . Whereas the dynamics of large Aplysia bag cell growth cone has been extensively studied on shorter time scales , we have complemented this knowledge here with live cell imaging on longer time scales . Two cellular features were discovered when large growth cones developed from small growth cones : ( 1 ) the C domain frequently changed its direction when large growth cones were in a pausing state and sometimes split into two domains ; ( 2 ) T zone ruffles appeared soon after the formation of a large growth cone and then gradually disappeared ( Figure 4 ( a ) ; Videos 1 and 3 ) . Efficient engorgement of the C domain into the area where the P domain was previously located is an important step during the formation of axons [ 14 ] . Swaying of the C domain as observed in large growth cones ( Figure 4 ; Video 1 ) may indicate a decision - making phase before final engorgement occurs in a particular direction . The varying angle between C domain orientation and the direction of growth in large growth cones ( Figure 4 ( c ) ) could be caused by the symmetrically expanding P domain and the fact that there are not enough microtubules and vesicles to fill the expanding C domain evenly . When the symmetry in the P domain was broken by disruption of actin bundles , large growth cones could be reoriented [ 45 ] . Splitting of the C domain was usually followed by branching of growth cones . It appears that large growth cones can only exit the pausing state by branch - ing into smaller ones , or they completely retract . Branching happened either spontaneously ( Figure 4 ) or by applying a collagen gel ( Figure 6 ( d ) ) . A similar branching pattern was observed after treatment of Helisoma growth cones with conditioning factors [ 46 ] . In contrast , in fast - growing small growth cones , the P domain was biased towards the direction of a small number of filopodia , and C domain maintained better alignment with the direction of growth ( Figures 4 ( b ) and 4 ( c ) ; Video 2 ) . Interestingly , in small growth cones , ruffles in the P domain were often generated towards the direction of advancement along the leading edge , preceding the formation of filopodia from P domain ( Figures 4 ( b ) and 5 ( c ) ; Video 3 ) , whereas , in large growth cones , ruffles were usually confined to the T zone and eventually disappeared ( Figure 4 ( a ) ) . Whether the ruffles along the leading edge of small growth cones and in the T zone of large growth cones have the same function with respect to motility is unclear at this point . We speculate that the initial ruffling activity in the T zone of large growth cones may indicate an attempt of the growth cone to grow vertically as opposed to expanding horizontally . 4 . 3 . Rescue of Growth Cone Translocation through 3D Collagen Gel . In vivo data suggests a correlation between growth cone morphology and motility : rapidly growing retinal ganglion cell growth cones in the optic nerve are smaller and have sim - ple shape , whereas , at decision - making positions such as the optic chiasm , growth cones adopt a more elaborate fan - shape with filopodial and lamellipodial extensions and grow at a significantly reduced rate [ 7 , 8 ] . The large growth cones from Aplysia bag cell neurons cultured on PLL may behave simi - larly to the second group , searching for chemical and physical cues that are scarce under the current culture conditions . For Aplysia bag cell neuron , this pausing state usually takes a long time ( typically longer than 3 h ) and redirecting its growth has been difficult . Physical interaction with either an Aplysia cell adhesion molecule - ( apCAM - ) coated bead or microneedle could lead to reorientation of C domain and increased advance rate [ 24 , 30 ] . However , since the microneedle was kept in the same position in these experiments , increased neurite growth rate did not persist once the C domain reached the microneedle . Through application of collagen I - based gel containing hemolymph on top of the growth cones , we were able to create and maintain a topographical cue that could reliably rescue the forward translocation of large growth cones ( Figure 6 ; Video 4 ) . Growth cones found in this culture environment had smaller size , faster growth rate , and a dramatically different morphology that was reminiscent of growth cone on patterned substrate [ 47 ] . The neurons in this 2D - 3D transition setup are not completely independent from the planar PLL - surface as indicated by the fact that neurites tend to remain close to the cover glass surface . To our knowledge , this 3D collagen gel is the only culture method that can induce well - consolidated neurites from Aplysia bag cell neurons . We believe the growth cones formed in this 2D - 3D transition setup may be more similar to the growth cones in living animals with respect to morphology and motility . The relative contributions of individual processes of cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics may differ between the 2D and 3D environments resulting in the observed differences in morphology and motility . The effect of this col - lagen gel - based approach may be attributable to the presence of micron scale topographical cue that can be sensed and responded to by the growth cone . By creating and maintain - ing this local difference , individual growth cones maintain a rapidly advancing state similar to retinal ganglion cell growth cones in the optical tract . Although technically challenging , it will be interesting to quantitatively analyze motility , cytoskeletal dynamics , and force production of bag cell growth cones in 3D and compare with existing 2D data to better understand the machinery that powers growth cone advancement in vivo . 12 Neural Plasticity 5 . Conclusion Here , we have shown that the typically observed large fan - shaped Aplysia bag cell growth cones formed on PLL - coated coverslip represent a specific pausing state early during cell culture , which is caused by a significant expansion of the lamellipodia and filopodia in the P domain . Small growth cones on PLL often grow faster than large growth cones , although a simple correlation between size and advance rate could not be established for small growth cones on PLL . An inverse correlation between growth cone size and growth rate , however , was found for large growth cones . The large pausing growth cones exhibited poor alignment between C domain and the direction of advancement , which could be indicative of the growth cone sampling the environment . In contrast , the small rapidly growing growth cones generated ruffles at the distal edge of P domain and grew as fast as 10 ùúá m / h without additional growth promoting factors . Application of collagen I - based gel promoted faster growth of bag cell growth cones and converted them into a more in vivo - like morphology . We conclude that significant lateral expansion of lamellipodia and filopodia as observed on PLL substrates during the initial culture period negatively affects neurite growth .
