In the mammalian host the parasite has to invade cells and many studies implicated the ﬂagellated trypomastigotes in this process . Several parasite surface components and some of host cell receptors with which they interact have been identiﬁed . Our work focused on how amastigotes , usually found growing in the cytoplasm , can invade mammalian cells with infectivities comparable to that of trypomastigotes . We found differences in cellular responses induced by amastigotes and trypomastigotes regarding cytoskeletal components and actin - rich projections . Extracellularly generated amastigotes of T . cruzi I strains may display greater infectivity than metacyclic trypomastigotes towards cultured cell lines as well as target cells that have modiﬁed expression of different classes of cellular components . Cultured host cells harboring the bacterium Coxiella burnetii allowed us to gain new insights into the trafﬁcking properties of the different infective forms of T . cruzi , disclosing unexpected requirements for the parasite to transit between the parasitophorous vacuole to its ﬁnal destination in the host cell cytoplasm .

OVERVIEW Since the pioneering studies by Herta Meyer and co - workers that initiated in vitro studies of T . cruzi development within cultured cells ( Meyer and Xa - vier de Oliveira 1948 ) followed by the detailed de - scription provided by James Dvorak and Thomas Hyde on how cells become infected by T . cruzi try - Correspondence to : RenatoA . Mortara E - mail : renato @ ecb . epm . br pomastigotes ( Dvorak and Hyde 1973 ) , numerous studies have been performed in order to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the rather complex process of parasite entry into mammalian host cells . A number of signiﬁcant contributions have provided evidence for the participation of both parasite and cellular components . Unfortunately , some of this work have established mechanisms that turned out not to be as universal or general as initially supposed ( Ming et al . 1995 , Ortega - Barria An Acad Bras Cienc ( 2005 ) 77 ( 1 ) 78 RENATO A . MORTARA ET AL . and Pereira 1991 , Tardieux et al . 1992 , 1994 ) . On the contrary , it has become increasingly apparent that a rather complex interplay of signaling cas - cades involving both parasite and cellular compo - nents seems to operate ( Burleigh andWoolsey 2002 , Yoshida 2002 ) . More recently , the discovery of dif - ferences in the invasion mechanisms engaged by metacyclic trypomastigotes from the two major phylogenetic lineages of the parasite opened new possibilities to deepen studies on this already intri - cate process ( Neira et al . 2002 ) . After entering host cells , trypomastigotes are usually found in an acidic membrane - bound com - partment referred to as phagosome or parasito - phorous vacuole ( PV ) , from where they eventually escape to differentiate into amastigotes in the cyto - plasm ( Kress et al . 1975 , Ley et al . 1990 , Meirelles et al . 1986 , 1987 , 1992 , Milder and Kloetzel 1980 , Nogueira and Cohn 1976 , Tanowitz et al . 1975 ) . In the course of these studies , it became apparent that amastigotes , prematurely released from infected cells or generated by the extracellular differentia - tion of released tissue - culture derived trypomastig - otes ( TCTs ) , could also infect cultured cells and an - imals ( Behbehani 1973 , Hudson et al . 1984 , Ley et al . 1988 , Nogueira and Cohn 1976 ) . Systematic studies on cell invasion and PV escape carried out in our laboratory have reinforced the notion that each infective form of the parasite displays a unique in - terplay with the speciﬁc target host cell with which it interacts . Not only the parasite infective form is relevant but also the strain ( and phylogenetic ori - gin ) will determine the outcome of the interaction . Furthermore , if target mammalian cells are doubly infected with Coxiella burnetii , the destination and nature of the intracellular compartments that con - tain T . cruzi infective forms will also be affected . The variety of mechanisms used for invasion and escape from the parasitophorous vacuoles engaged by amastigotes and trypomastigotes is consistent with the complex repertoires of both infective forms and surface molecules that the parasite has evolved to ensure host colonization . EARLY OBSERVATIONS ON THE ENTRY OF TRYPOMASTIGOTESAND EXTRACELLULAR AMASTIGOTES IN HeLaAND Vero CELLS It has become increasingly evident that several intracellular pathogens specialized in subverting host cell pathways to their beneﬁt . This is particu - larly well characterized for invasive bacteria such as Shigella , Listeria and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli ( EPEC ) ( Bourdet - Sicard et al . 2000 , Cossart 1997 , Dramsi and Cossart 1998 , Frischknecht and Way 2001 , Goosney et al . 2000 ) . Interaction be - tween EPEC and HeLa cells involved aggregation of surface microvilli at the points where the bac - terium attached to the dorsal surface of cultured HeLa cells ( Silva et al . 1989 ) . In order to promote the interaction , the bacteria were centrifuged onto the cells and actin aggregation was monitored by staining cells with ﬂuorescently labeled phalloidin , using what is now known as the FAS ( ﬂuorescent actin staining ) assay ( Silva et al . 1989 ) . Earlier data in the literature indicated that amastigotes ( or amastigote - like forms ) could be generated by the extracellular differentiation of trypomastigotes and these forms were capable of invading cultured cells ( Behbehani 1973 , Hudson et al . 1984 , Ley et al . 1988 , Nogueira and Cohn 1976 ) . Using the EPEC - derived protocol , we then centrifuged extracellular amastigotes of the G strain onto HeLa cells and ob - served that they promptly aggregate actin ﬁlaments by attaching to dorsal surface microvilli ( Mortara 1991 ) . Microvillus aggregation was followed by the formation of cup - like structures underneath the par - asite ( Figure 1 ) , that resemble the pedestals formed during EPEC attachment / effacing ( Rosenshine and Finlay 1993 ) . Extracellular amastigote invasion can be easily detected by several techniques , including freeze - fracture replicas of recently - infected HeLa cells ( Figure 2 ) . By contrast , trypomastigotes enter HeLa cells by penetrating at their borders ( Mortara 1991 ) , a behavior that had been described by Schenkman et al . ( 1988 ) . Interestingly , the invasion of HeLa cells by trypomastigotes induced the formation of previ - ously undescribed actin - rich pseudopodial protru - An Acad Bras Cienc ( 2005 ) 77 ( 1 ) T . cruzi INVASION AND TRAFFIC 79 Fig . 1 – Formation of a cup - like pedestal ( arrow ) upon invasion of HeLa cells by extracellular amastigotes .

This phenomenon was not in - hibited by cytochalasin D indicting that the major driving force derived from the parasite , and was de - tected in HeLa but not in MDCK cells ( Schenkman Fig . 3 – Formation of sleeve - like pseudopodia around trypo - mastigotes invading HeLa cells . Scanning electron microscopy showing the membrane expansion ( arrow ) around the invading trypomastigote ( Schenkman and Mortara 1992 ) . Bar : 2 µ m . and Mortara 1992 ) . Later on , other investigators found similar pseudopodial extensions around try - pomastigotes invading cadiomyocytes ( Barbosa and Meirelles 1995 ) . We further investigated the entry of extracel - lular amastigotes into HeLa and Vero cells using the centrifugation protocol and compared the results with metacyclic trypomastigotes . First , we con - ﬁrmed that the mechanisms of cell invasion used by the two forms is distinct , in line with results of Schenkman et al . ( 1991a ) that observed no compe - tition towards cell binding between the two forms . We then treated the mammalian target cells with cytochalasin D and nocodazole to evaluate the role of actin and tubulin mobilization . Cytochalasin D always inhibited amastigote invasion indicating that unlike what was observed for trypomastigotes , amastigotes had a more passive role in the entry pro - cess . Nevertheless , the main conclusion was that the effect of a particular drug was speciﬁc and un - predictable ( inhibitory or stimulatory ) for a parasite infective form and a particular host cell ( Procópio et al . 1998 ) . Besides the formation of the surface cups in HeLa cells , we also noticed a remarkable response to extracellular amastigotes when they invade Vero An Acad Bras Cienc ( 2005 ) 77 ( 1 ) 80 RENATO A . MORTARA ET AL . cells . In this ﬁbroblastic cell line devoid of surface microvilli , protrusive lamellae formed at the sites of amastigote invasion ( Procópio et al . 1999 ) were markedly similar to shown by attaching Shigella ﬂexneri ( Bourdet - Sicard et al . 2000 , Clerc and Sansonetti 1987 , Tran et al . 2000 ) . In ﬁgure 4 the co - localization of different actin - binding pro - teins and actin ﬁlaments in the membrane projec - tions involved in T . cruzi invasion of HeLa and Vero cells is illustrated . In all the actin - rich membrane extensions formed around invading amastigotes or trypomastigotes , accumulation of cytoskeletal ele - ments , integrins or matrix elements could be de - tected , with some variability observed between the infective forms and target cells ( Procópio et al . 1999 ) . These results were again consistent with the notion that each parasite - host cell pair mobilizes speciﬁc interacting components ( see Table I ) . INTRACELLULAR VS . EXTRACELLULAR AMASTIGOTESAS INFECTIVE FORMS OF THE PARASITE Although intracellular amastigotes are larger and slightly more elongated than extracellular forms ( Barros et al . 1996 ) , they share biochemical and ultrastructural similarities ( Andrews et al . 1987 , Ley et al . 1988 , Villalta and Kierszenbaum 1982 ) and express similar antigenic stage - speciﬁc markers ( Andrews et al . 1987 , Barros et al . 1997 , Pan and McMahon - Pratt 1989 , Silva et al . 1998 , Verbisck et al . 1998 ) . Studies with strains of T . cruzi I and II , suggest that the expression of the epitopes de - ﬁned by monoclonal antibodies may vary consider - ably among intracellular and extracellular amastig - otes of the two lineages ( Verbisck et al . 1998 ) . Fur - ther studies with isolates from chagasic patients tend to conﬁrm this extensive polymorphism ( Silva C . V . , unpublished observations ) . While previous results from the literature have provided conﬂicting evidence regarding the infec - tivity of T . cruzi intracellular amastigotes ( Carvalho et al . 1981 , Ley et al . 1988 , Ulisses de Carvalho and De Souza 1986 , Umezawa et al . 1985 ) , there are reports that infective extracellular amastigotes resist antibody - independent complement lysis ( Iida et al . 1989 ) . We found that intracellular amastig - otes ( isolated from infected cells ) of strains from both T . cruzi I or T . cruzi II groups are highly sus - ceptible to complement lysis and poorly infective to either Vero or HeLa cells , as well as to MDCK cells transfected with Rho GTPases ( Barros 1996 , Fernandes and Mortara 2004 ) . A plausible explana - tion for these results is that intracellular amastigotes are committed to growth within a sheltered environ - ment whereas extracellular forms have to cope with a more hostile milieu where they may encounter not only speciﬁc antibodies ( Andrews 1989 ) but also complement proteins ( Iida et al . 1989 ) . Acquisition of complement resistance and infectivity by extra - cellular amastigotes is certainly an interesting and as yet poorly understood process that deserves further investigation . T . cruzi INVASION OF CELLS TRANSFECTED WITH CYTOSKELETAL ELEMENTS , CARBOHYDRATES OR REGULATORY Rho - GTPases In the course of our studies we used a number of availablecelllineswithalteredexpressionofdistinct components . Cytoskeletal mutants of a melanoma celllineexpressingvaryingamountsofactinbinding protein 280 , ABP280 ( Cunningham et al . 1992 ) , a microﬁlament cross - linking protein , as well as NIH mouse ﬁbroblasts expressing variable amounts of the actin assembly regulator protein gelsolin ( Cunningham et al . 1991 ) display distinct suscep - tibility towards metacyclic trypomastigotes or ex - tracellular amastigotes of the G strain ( Procópio et al . 1998 ) . We also observed that CHO cells with poorly sialylated proteins ( Lec - 2 cells , Deutscher et al . 1984 ) are slightly more susceptible to extracel - lular amastigotes , when compared to the normal controls ( Stecconi - Silva et al . 2003 ) . The observation that amastigotes and trypo - mastigotes become associated with distinct actin - rich projections upon cell invasion prompted us to examine the role of regulatory Rho GTPases in this process .

Later , Cdc42 was shown to promote the formation of actin - rich , ﬁnger like membrane extensions ( ﬁlopodia ) ( Kozma et al . 1995 , Nobes and Hall 1995 ) . Thus , RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 regulate three separate sig - nal transduction pathways , linking plasma mem - brane receptors to the assembly of distinct ﬁlamen - tous actin structures . In order to evaluate the rela - tive importance of RhoA GTPases in host cell inva - sion by different T . cruzi infective forms of distinct strains , we used MDCK cells transfectants that ex - press variants of RhoA , Rac1 and Cdc42 proteins ( Jou and Nelson 1998 ) . We demonstrated that meta - cyclic trypomastigotes from strains of T . cruzi I pre - sented lower infectivity than T . cruzi II parasites for the different target cells , with no apparent speciﬁc requirement for GTPases ( Fernandes and Mortara 2004 ) . As previously noted , regardless of the strain analyzed , intracellular amastigotes were not only susceptible to complement lysis but also showed very low infectivity towards the different transfec - tants . Extracellular amastigotes from G strain in - fected transfected MDCK cells more efﬁciently than the other strains . Invasion was particularly high in Rac1V12 cells and was speciﬁcally reduced in the corresponding dominant negative line Rac1N17 suggesting a key role for Rac in this inva - sion process ( Fernandes and Mortara 2004 ) . CELL INVASION BY EXTRACELLULAR AMASTIGOTESAND METACYCLIC TRYPOMASTIGOTES OF STRAINS FROM THE TWO MAJOR PHYLOGENETIC LINEAGES Several laboratories have conﬁrmed the observation that T . cruzi infective forms from different strains display distinct infectivities towards cells and ani - mals ( Alves et al . 1986 , Meirelles et al . 1982b , Melo and Brener 1978 ) . Recent characterization of two major phylogenetic lineages of the parasite es - tablished that T . cruzi I strains are associated with the sylvatic cycle whereas T . cruzi II isolates An Acad Bras Cienc ( 2005 ) 77 ( 1 ) T . cruzi INVASION AND TRAFFIC 83 are found mainly in patients and vectors in human dwellings ( Souto et al . 1996 ) . The comprehen - sive work by Nobuko Yoshida and co - workers ( see below ) established that metacyclic trypomastigotes from T . cruzi I ( G strain ) engage different signaling mechanisms to invade HeLa cells when compared to T . cruzi II ( CL strain ) ( Neira et al . 2002 ) . When we initiated the studies of extracellu - lar amastigote infection , it soon became apparent that these forms of the G strain ( T . cruzi I ) were usually much more infective than the correspond - ing metacyclic trypomastigotes . This was true not only for Vero and HeLa cells ( Mortara 1991 , Procó - pio et al . 1998 , Procópio et al . 1999 ) but also for the sialic acid mutant Lec - 2 cells ( Stecconi - Silva et al . 2003 ) . Of all target mammalian cells em - ployed so far , only in the case of MDCK cells and the Rho transfectants , was metacyclic trypomastig - otes infectivity higher than the corresponding extra - cellular amastigotes ( see Table I and Fernandes and Mortara 2004 ) . When the infectivity of extracellular amastig - otes derived from sylvatic type I strains was system - atically compared to type II parasites , we always found that the former , particularly of the G strain , were much more infective ( Barros 1996 , Fernandes and Mortara 2004 , Mortara et al . 1999 ) . Interest - ingly , this higher infectivity trend followed the ex - pression of a surface carbohydrate epitope deﬁned by Mab 1D9 ( Barros et al . 1997 ) , that is correspond - ingly high in extracellular amastigotes of T . cruzi I strains and low in T . cruzi II isolates ( Mortara et al . 1999 , Verbisck et al . 1998 ) . Moreover , the carbo - hydrate epitope deﬁned by Mab 1D9 is present in the same protein that also contains another epitope designated Ssp - 4 , deﬁned by Mab 2C2 ( Andrews et al . 1987 , Barros et al . 1997 ) . Unlike 2C2 that is restricted to the surface of intracellular and ex - tracellular amastigotes , the epitope deﬁned by Mab 1D9 is also present in intracellular compartments such as cytoplasmic vesicles and Golgi apparatus ( Barros et al . 1997 ) . Consistent with the higher ex - pression on the more infective T . cruzi I extracellular amastigotes , Mab 1D9 and its Fab fragments were also shown to speciﬁcally inhibit parasite invasion ( Barros et al . 1993 , Barros 1996 ) . Unfortunately , due to the nature of the immunoglobulin ( IgG3 ) that precipitated upon isolation , the identiﬁcation of this epitope of extracellular amastigotes has so far not been possible . Why extracellular amastigotes of highly infec - tive strains such as Y and CL are poorly infective when compared to type I parasites , particularly G forms , showing the opposite behavior of the related trypomastigotes ? This is a trend that we constantly found and that , so far we don’t have a reasonable explanation . One highly speculative possibility is that subpatent infection caused by type I parasites ( such as that found in experimental mice ) could be at least in part sustained by the generation of in - fective extracellular amastigotes . Scharfstein and Morrot ( 1999 ) proposed that extracellular amastig - otes ( of either T . cruzi type ) could also play a role by aggravating the pathology in the chronic phase of the disease . Possible differences in the expression of surface ligands required for cell invasion should also being considered ( see below ) . Signalling Mechanisms : Role of Calcium Ions from Acidocalcisomes or IP 3 - dependent Compartments As indicated above , metacyclic trypomastigotes of the two major phylogenetic lineages use highly di - vergent signaling mechanisms to invade host cells . Using drugs to inhibit speciﬁc pathways , Yoshida and collaborators demonstrated that T . cruzi I try - pomastigotes ( the prototype being G strain ) engage adenylate cyclase activation for cellular invasion whereas CL strain parasites ( T . cruzi II prototype ) depend on tyrosine phosphorylation to accomplish this process ( Neira et al . 2002 ) . Also , G strain metacyclics appear to mobilize intracellular calcium from acidocalcisomes whereas CL strain parasites preferentially use ( 1 , 4 , 5 - inositol - triphosphate , IP 3 - dependent ) endoplasmic reticulum stores during in - vasion ( Neira et al . 2002 ) . Preliminary results from comparative studies between metacyclic try - pomastigotes and extracellular amastigotes of the An Acad Bras Cienc ( 2005 ) 77 ( 1 ) 84 RENATO A . MORTARA ET AL . G strain , indicated that drugs that interfere with ER calcium mobilization ( thapsigargin , A23187 iono - phore ) do not affect invasion of treated amastig - otes ( Stecconi - Silva et al . 2003 ) . Further analy - sis with other IP 3 - interfering compounds ( caffeine , neomycin and U73122 ) conﬁrmed that calcium mo - bilization in the parasite through IP 3 mobilization is not relevant for cellular invasion by extracellu - lar amastigotes of either G or CL strains ( Table I , Fernandes A . B . , unpublished observations ) . Inter - estingly , drugs that interfere with calcium mobiliza - tion from acidocalcisomes ( ionomycin , nigericin , NH 4 Cl ) inhibit cell invasion by parasites of both strains ( FernandesA . B . , unpublished observations ) , in contrast to the results of metacyclic trypomastig - otes ( Neira et al . 2002 ) . From the host cell point of view , contact with TCT ( Tardieux et al . 1994 ) or metacyclic trypomastigotes ( Dorta et al . 1995 ) , but not epimastigotes ( Tardieux et al . 1994 ) give rise to transient calcium inﬂuxes . We have observed that cell extracts of extracellular amastigotes of both G and CL strains also induce calcium inﬂuxes in HeLa cells loaded with Fura - 2 ( FernandesA . B . , un - published observations ) . These observations sug - gest that the distinct signaling pathways detected in metacyclics are not retained by extracellular amasti - gotes from the two phylogenetic lineages ( Table I ) . A comprehensive study of these signaling routes is currently being carried out in our laboratory . CELL INVASIONAND INTRACELLULAR FATE OF INFECTIVE FORMS As mentioned earlier , an increasing number of both cellular and parasitic components that may be rel - evant for T . cruzi cell invasion have been identiﬁed over the last decades . A pragmatic analysis over the extensive and varied types of studies could lead the outsider to conclude that it is still not known precisely how T . cruzi invades host cells . For inva - sion to occur the parasite ﬁrst has to attach , a pro - cess that can be separated from invasion by lower - ing temperature or ﬁxing target cells ( Andrews and Colli 1982 , Meirelles et al . 1982a , Schenkman et al . 1991b ) . Several lines of evidence indicate , how - ever , that motile trypomastigotes ( both TCTs and metacyclics ) promptly attach to ﬁxed cells and in - vade live cells through an active ( meaning parasite - dependent ) mechanism that does not require intact host cell microﬁlaments ( Schenkman et al . 1991b , Schenkman and Mortara 1992 ) but depends on par - asite energy ( Schenkman et al . 1991b ) . By con - trast , extracellular amastigote attachment to ﬁxed cells does not occur ( Barros 1996 ) and invasion de - pends on functional host cell microﬁlaments ( Mor - tara 1991 , Procópio et al . 1998 ) . A brief glance into these data immediately uncovers the complex - ity of the task . Among the paradigmatic studies that laid new insights into the invasion mechanism is the descrip - tion by the group of Norma Andrews that calcium - dependent lysosomal recruitment takes place dur - ing trypomastigote invasion ( Tardieux et al . 1992 , 1994 ) . According to this model , TCTs engage sig - naling processes that culminate with the formation of parasitophorous vacuole ( Burleigh and Andrews 1998 , Burleigh and Woolsey 2002 ) . New evidences on the participation of compo - nents of the early endocytic trafﬁc such as dynamin and Rab5 have indicated that the lysosomal pro - cess might be more elaborate and downstream of earlier events ( Wilkowsky et al . 2002 ) . We have also recently obtained evidence that about 20 % of CL strain ( T . cruzi II ) metacyclic trypomastigotes may also recruit the early endosome antigen EEA - 1 when invading Vero cells harboring the bacterium Coxiella burnetii ( Andreoli and Mortara 2003a ) . Using a more quantitative approach to identify the role of phosphatidyl - inositol 3 - kinase ( PI3 - K ) on the lysosomal pathway , Woolsey et al . ( 2003 ) were able to ﬁrmly conﬁrm previous observations by Wilkowsky et al . ( 2001 ) that this cellular key component could be involved in a lysosome - independent T . cruzi internalization pathway by TCTs . Trypomastigotes that use this route mobilize phosphorylated inositides during the formation of the parasitophorous vacuole that then matures to be - come enriched in lysosomal marker LAMP - 1 . One important input of this work was that for the ﬁrst An Acad Bras Cienc ( 2005 ) 77 ( 1 ) T . cruzi INVASION AND TRAFFIC 85 time the relative contributions of each mode of en - try , namely PI3 - K ( 50 % ) , lysosome ( 20 % ) , and en - dosomal route ( 20 % ) were estimated ( Woolsey et al . 2003 ) . The available information on the mechanisms of amastigote penetration is comparatively scarcer than for trypomastigote . In studies on the interac - tion with macrophages , it has been described that members of the transialidase - like surface antigens engage mannose receptors to enter the professional phagocytes ( Kahn et al . 1995 ) . In non - phagocytic cells we so far have been able to identify the previ - ously mentioned carbohydrate epitope ( deﬁned by Mab 1D9 ) as one of the potential molecular can - didates on extracellular amastigote surface that in - teract with cultured mammalian cells . The rela - tive role of PI3 - K , endosomal and the already de - scribed LAMP - 1 ( Procópio et al . 1998 ) pathways in extracellular amastigote invasion will be examined with the appropriate GFP constructs , described by Woolsey et al . ( 2003 ) that recently became avail - able to us . Once inside host cells , trypomastigotes are thought to secrete TcTOX , a complement 9 ( C9 ) factor - related molecule that at low pH will destroy the PV membrane and lead the parasite to the cy - tosol ( Andrews et al . 1990 ) . This lytic activity is likely to be facilitated by the parasite transialidase activity on lumenal glycoproteins that protect the parasitophorous vacuole ( Hall et al . 1992 ) . Infec - tive extracellular amastigotes also secrete TcTOX ( Y and G strains ) and transialidase ( Andrews and Whitlow 1989 , Ley et al . 1990 , Stecconi - Silva et al . 2003 , L’Abbate and Fernandes unpublished ob - servations ) . In recent studies we compared how pH affected cellular invasion and intracellular traf - ﬁc of metacyclic trypomastigotes and extracellular amastigotes . We had previously conﬁrmed that re - cently internalized amastigotes and metacyclic try - pomastigotes ( G strain ) can be found in LAMP - 1 - containing PVs ( Procópio et al . 1998 ) . Raising in - tracellular pH with weak bases affected metacyclic invasion and escape from the PV , that was substan - tially delayed ( from 2 to about 10h ) . By contrast , the kinetics of amastigote invasion and escape was not affected ( Stecconi - Silva et al . 2003 ) . In agree - ment with the idea that glycosylation of lysosomal lumenal glycoproteins is relevant for the protection of the PV membrane , both parasite forms promptly escape from PVs formed in CHO cells deﬁcient in sialylation ( Stecconi - Silva et al . 2003 ) . So far we have been able to identify TcTOX activities in isolated extracellular amastigotes ( Stecconi - Silva et al . 2003 ) and tissue - culture de - rived trypomastigotes ( Andreoli and Mortara 2003a ) . In contrast , metacyclic trypomastigotes display very weak transialidase activity and unde - tectable TcTOX ( Andreoli and Mortara 2003a , Stecconi - Silva et al . 2003 ) . Therefore , whereas extracellular amastigotes display a somewhat pre - dictablebehaviorregardingcellinvasionandescape , at present we do not have a consistent model to un - derstand how metacyclic trypomastigotes actually escape from their PVs . Using polyclonal antibod - ies to C9 , we have recently been able to detect by immunoﬂuorescence what appears to be a TcTOX - related component on intracellular amastigotes ( Andreoli W . K . , unpublished observations ) and this tool may be useful to map this component through - outthe intracellular trafﬁc of the different infective forms . Another interesting observation regarding metacyclic trypomastigote trafﬁc is that the acquisi - tion of LAMP - 1 molecules by the forming PV does not parallel its acidiﬁcation , monitored in vivo by Lysotracker , a ﬂuorescent probe for acidic intracel - lular compartments ( Molecular Probes , OR , USA , Andreoli W . K . , unpublished observations ) . This may indicate that the precise events that lead to PV maturation might be more elaborate than previously imagined . INVASION BY T . cruzi OF Vero CELLS COLONIZED WITH Coxiella burnetii The study of cell co - infection may allow the ob - servation of the behavior of pathogens in the pres - ence of one another , and provide new insights on the course of infection and interaction of each pathogen with the endocytic pathway ( Rabinovitch An Acad Bras Cienc ( 2005 ) 77 ( 1 ) 86 RENATO A . MORTARA ET AL . Fig . 5 – BaﬁlomycinA1 induces dispersion of EGFP - LAMP1 - labeled C . burnetti vacuoles . Sequential series of DIC images with the corresponding ﬂuorescence in cells treated with Baf 1A . Bar in µ m . et al . 1999 , Rabinovitch andVeras 1996 ) . In the last years , we began to examine the behavior of T . cruzi trypomastigotes upon invasion of cells that had been previously colonized with Coxiella burnetii , an obligate intracellular bacterium and causative agent of Q fever , an opportunistic human pneumo - nia . C . burnetii may inhabit both phagocytic and non - phagocytic cells ( Baca and Paretsky 1983 ) whereitformslargecytoplasmicvacuoleswithlyso - somal characteristics by acquisition of hydrolases and lysosomal markers ( LAMP - 1 and LAMP - 2 ) . C . burnetii is a well adapted organism that accom - plishes all metabolic processes at low pH ( Hackstadt and Williams 1981 ) , as it has been established that their vacuoles maintain an acidic pH during infec - tion ( Maurin et al . 1992 ) . A previously demon - strated hallmark of C . burnetii vacuoles is their fu - sogenicity : from inert particles to different intra - cellular pathogens can easily be targeted to this new compartment ( Rabinovitch et al . 1999 ) . A very use - ful quality of this system is that persistent infection can be easily established and cells harboring large C . burnetti vacuoles can be maintained in culture for several weeks . We began to exploit this feature to examine the co - infection with T . cruzi . Trypomastigotes The presence of the bacterium ( in persistent infec - tions ) per se can hinder infection by trypomastig - otes ( TCTs and metacyclics , CL strain ) inVero cells . However , inhibitors of vacuolar ATPases and weak bases that also raise intravacuolar pH have a dra - matic effect on the invasion processes ( Andreoli and Mortara 2003a ) . Whereas in Vero cells , raising pH reduces infectivity , presumably by affecting the lysosomal pathway ( Andrews 1995 , Tardieux et al . 1992 ) , cells colonized with C . burnetii are more susceptible to trypomastigote invasion than the un - treated controls . This unexpected effect probably reﬂects the fragmentation of the large vacuole when An Acad Bras Cienc ( 2005 ) 77 ( 1 ) T . cruzi INVASION AND TRAFFIC 87 cells are treated with these drugs ( Figure 5 ) . One possibility is that LAMP - 1 molecules become in - creasingly exposed at the cell surface thus facilitat - ing the lysosomal route for internalization ( Kima et al . 2000 ) . The ultimate goal of these experiments was to transfer trypomastigotes from the cytoplasm to the C . burnetii vacuole , through the fusion between the bacterium vacuole and PV . Metacyclic trypo - mastigotes were readily transferred but TCTs es - caped from their PVs and released themselves into the cytoplasm . This difference can be accounted for by the low TcTOX and transialidase activities in metacyclics : since these forms remain longer in their PVs ( Stecconi - Silva et al . 2003 ) , they have more opportunities to be transferred to the C . bur - netii vacuole ( Andreoli and Mortara 2003a ) . In - travacuolar pH measurements in live cells indicated that trypomastigotes are preferentially transferred to more acidic vacuoles ( pH 4 . 0 – 4 . 7 ) , and raising vacuolar pH with the compounds mentioned above , dramatically decreased transfer efﬁciency ( Andreoli and Mortara 2003a ) . A previously undescribed re - lease of LAMP - 1 from the PV is shown in ﬁgure 6 . In these studies with cells transfected with GFP - LAMP - 1 we have also obtained evidence that in - ternalization of metacyclic trypomastigotes may in - volve erratic translocations of parasites surrounded by PV membrane through the cytoplasm ( Figure 6 ) . Comparative studies between TCTs and metacyclic trypomastigotes of T . cruzi I and T . cruzi II strains suggested , again , that trafﬁcking in Vero cells colo - nized with C . burnetii may vary substantially among the different isolates and infective forms ( Table I , L’Abbate C . , unpublished observations ) . Amastigotes Bearing in mind our previous experience with amastigote invasion of HeLa andVero cells , we have been examining how the intracellular bacteria per - sistently growing inside Vero cells could affect the process . We compared T . cruzi I ( G strain ) extra - cellular amastigotes with T . cruzi II parasites ( CL strain ) . Unlike to what was seen for the trypo - Fig . 6 – T . cruzi metacyclicPVsmoveinsideVerocellsharboring C . burnetti leavingtrailsofLAMP - 1 .

The observation that the transfer - ence of amastigotes to the C . burnetii vacuole was An Acad Bras Cienc ( 2005 ) 77 ( 1 ) 88 RENATO A . MORTARA ET AL . enhanced by weak bases but reduced by vacuolar ATPase inhibitors ( Fernandes M . C . , unpublished observations ) is a strong evidence that the intra - cellular trafﬁcking compartments used by amasti - gotes ( and possibly their maturation ) are different form those used by trypomastigotes ( Andreoli and Mortara 2003a ) . Growth and Differentiation of Trypomastigotes Within the Coxiella burnetii Vacuole Once inside the C . burnetii vacuole , metacyclics differentiate into amastigotes as well as in epimas - tigote - like forms . This can be demonstrated by morphological examination and immunolabeling parasites with speciﬁc anti - amastigote ( Barros et al . 1997 ) and anti - epimastigote ( Almeida - de - Faria et al . 1999 ) antibodies . Intravacuolar pH measure - ments in vivo indicate that in spite of the acidic milieu , amastigotes retained a neutral pH in their cytoplasm while growing in the bacterium vacuole ( Andreoli and Mortara 2003b ) . Using T . cruzi trans - fected with histone 2 - GFP ( Yamauchi et al . 1997 ) we conﬁrmed that amastigote division takes about 70 min ( Figure 7 ) . In spite of several attempts , we could not demonstrate the transformation of amastigotes growing inside the C . burnetii vacuole into trypomastigotes . Indications that cytoplasmic parasites grew substantially outside the vacuole in doubly - infected cells after 48 - 72h , without parallel infection by new trypomastigotes , led us to investigate whether amastigotes and / or epimastigotes could be escap - ing from the bacterium vacuole . Studies involving live cell video imaging , confocal and electron mi - croscopy strongly suggested that these forms can escape from the bacterium vacuole ( Andreoli and Mortara 2003b ) . We also demonstrated that amas - tigotes express C9 - related TcTOX inside the C . burnetii vacuole that might be important for disrup - tion of the bacterium vacuolar membrane . PERSPECTIVES It is clear that the mechanisms of invasion used by T . cruzi extracellular amastigotes , TCTs and meta - cyclic trypomastigotes are divergent . Added to this complexity is the ﬁnding of variation between iso - lates of the two main phylogenetic groups . The molecular information available for trypomastigote penetration , with the identiﬁcation of putative lig - ands and their receptors , has not been paralleled in amastigote studies . So far , only a few parasite components , most of carbohydrate nature have been identiﬁed as important components for cell inva - sion . Emergingevidencesuggestthattheseinfective forms might , presumably by engaging different re - ceptors , be trafﬁcking in cytoplasmic compartments of distinct composition and maturation characteris - tics . The introduction of the companion pathogen , C . burnetii , has revealed new insights into these in - tricate processes . Mapping amastigote ligands and their putative receptors should provide molecular tools to explore these interactions in deeper detail . Also , the availability of GFP - tagged components acting in host cell endocytic and lysosomal path - ways will offer the unique opportunity to carry out live cell experiments .
