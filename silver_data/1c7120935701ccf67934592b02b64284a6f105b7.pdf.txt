Korn * ‡ Laboratories of * Cell Biology and † Biochemistry , National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD 20892 Contributed by Edward D . Korn , July 25 , 2006 Dictyostelium actin was shown to become phosphorylated on Tyr - 53 late in the developmental cycle and when cells in the amoeboid stage are subjected to stress but the phosphorylated actin had not been puriﬁed and characterized . We have separated phosphorylated and unphosphorylated actin and shown that Tyr - 53 phosphorylation substantially reduces actin’s ability to inactivate DNase I , increases actin’s critical concentration , and greatly reduces its rate of polymerization . Tyr - 53 phosphorylation substantially , if not completely , inhibits nucleation and elongation from the pointed end of actin ﬁlaments and reduces the rate of elongation from the barbed end . Negatively stained electron microscopic images of polymerized Tyr - 53 – phosphorylated actin show a variable mixture of small oligomers and ﬁlaments , which are converted to more typical , long ﬁlaments upon addition of myosin subfragment 1 . Tyr - 53 – phosphorylated and unphosphor - ylated actin copolymerize in vitro , and phosphorylated and un - phosphorylated actin colocalize in amoebae . Tyr - 53 phosphoryla - tion does not affect the ability of ﬁlamentous actin to activate myosin ATPase . actin polymerization (cid:1) Dictyostelium (cid:1) phosphorylated actin T ransfer of Dictyostelium amoebae from nutrient to nonnu - trient medium initiates a 24 - hour developmental cycle ( 1 ) in which the amoebae aggregate and differentiate to form multi - cellular organisms that mature to fruiting bodies containing stable spores from which , when they are placed in nutrient medium , amoebae germinate . Several laboratories ( 2 – 4 ) re - ported tyrosine phosphorylation of actin [ phosphotyrosine actin ( pY - actin ) ] correlated with rearrangements of the actin cy - toskeleton during the developmental cycle . pY - actin appears late in maturing spores , i . e . , (cid:1) 24 h into the developmental cycle , reaches a maximum level at (cid:1) 36 h , at which time (cid:1) 50 % of the actin is phosphorylated ( 3 ) , remains constant for (cid:1) 20 days , at 22°C , and then decreases , disappearing entirely by 30 days , at which time the spores are no longer viable ( 3 ) . When viable spores are placed in nutrient medium , pY - actin is dephospho - rylated , with a half - life of (cid:1) 5 min ( 3 ) , before spore swelling and germination ( 2 , 4 ) . Although vegetative amoebae in nutrient medium contain little or no pY - actin ( 5 , 6 ) , phosphorylation transiently increases ( for (cid:1) 20 – 25 min ) when amoebae are transferred from nonnu - trient to nutrient medium ( 7 ) , with concurrent changes in cell shape , for example , loss of pseudopods , rounding up of the previously elongated cells , and weakened adherence to the substratum ( 7 ) . Tyrosine phosphorylation also occurs when vegetative amoebae in nutrient medium are exposed to pheny - larsine oxide ( PAO ) ( 5 ) , an inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phos - phatase , or are subjected to stress , for example , inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation ( 8 , 9 ) or elevated temperature ( 9 ) , with parallel changes in cell shape similar to the changes that occur when cells are transferred from nonnutrient to nutrient medium . Importantly , phosphorylation occurs uniquely at Tyr - 53 ( 9 ) . Thus , phosphorylation of actin at Tyr - 53 is associated with , but not necessarily responsible for , cytoskeletal reorganization and shape changes in vegetative cells induced by changes in nutri - tional status or stress and with spore dormancy and viability . To begin to understand the molecular basis of these biological events , we have characterized the polymerization properties of highly purified pY53 - actin and its ability to inhibit DNase I and activate myosin ATPase . Results First , we confirmed the earlier reports that pY - actin is present at low levels in growing vegetative cells , essentially disappears when the amoebae are starved , and reappears at relatively high levels in mature fruiting bodies ( Fig . 1 A ) . We also confirmed that CdCl 2 slightly increases , and heat , NaN 3 , and PAO greatly increase the level of actin tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig . 1 B ) . In addition , we found that the amount of pY - actin substantially increases in vegetative cells after 3 – 5 days in culture medium ( Fig . 1 C ) , i . e . , when cells reach maximum density . That the phosphorylation is tyrosine - specific was confirmed by the fact that immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine - specific antibody was blocked by excess pTyr but not by excess pSer or pThr ( Fig . 1 D ) . Like nonphosphorylated actin , pY - actin localizes to pseu - dopods and filopods in vegetative cells , where it colocalizes with unphosphorylated actin ( Fig . 2 ) .

HPLC - mass spectrometry ( Table 1 ) confirmed the identifica - tions of the two fractions in Fig . 4 A as N - acetylated unphos - phorylated and monophosphorylated actin , which was further supported by the loss of 80 mass units from phosphorylated actin and no change in the mass of unphosphorylated actin , when incubated with phosphatase ( Table 1 ) . Phosphorylation of Tyr - 53 was confirmed by HPLC - mass spectrometry of LysC - digests of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated actin ( Fig . 5 ) . The only differences between the two spectra are the absence of peak A and the appearance of peak B in the digest of phosphorylated actin . Peptides A and B had the predicted masses for the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated pep - tides , respectively , spanning residues 51 – 61 ( DSYVG - DEAQSK ) ( Table 1 ) . Properties of pY53 - Actin . Tyr - 53 phosphorylation greatly reduces actin’s ability to inhibit pancreatic DNase I activity ( Fig . 6 ) , with an IC 50 of 13 nM vs . an IC 50 of 1 . 5 nM for unphosphorylated actin . Also , Tyr - 53 phosphorylation increases the apparent critical concentration for polymerization ( Fig . 7 A ) from 0 . 5 to 1 . 25 (cid:1) M . Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated actin copoly - merize , as shown by the incorporation of pY53 - actin into fila - ments of unphosphorylated actin at a concentration of pY53 - actin ( 0 . 2 (cid:1) M ) well below its critical concentration ( Fig . 7 B ) . In the absence of nucleating seeds , pY53 - actin polymerizes much more slowly than unphosphorylated actin ( control curves in Fig . 8 A and B ) . Addition of gelsolin - unphosphorylated actin seeds , which nucleate polymerization by binding to barbed ends of nascent filaments , accelerates elongation of unphosphory - lated actin ( Fig . 8 B ) but inhibits elongation of pY53 - actin ( Fig . 8 A ) , indicating that pY53 - actin can add only very slowly , if at all , Fig . 2 .

On the other hand , Arp2 (cid:2) 3 - VCA ( verpolin , cofilin , and acidic domains of human wASP ) , which generates new barbed ends by binding to existing filaments , substantially accelerates polymerization of pY53 - actin ( Fig . 8 A ) , indicating that pY53 - actin can add to the barbed ends of filaments , albeit apparently more slowly than unphosphory - lated actin ( Fig . 8 B ) . Hydrolysis of actin - bound ATP occurs after the addition of actin monomer to the growing filament ( 10 ) , but , under normal polymerization conditions in vitro , the two events are almost concurrent . However , ATP hydrolysis accompanying spectrin - unphosphorylated actin - nucleated polymerization of pY53 - actin is much slower than for unphosphorylated actin ( Fig . 8 C ) . Even as polymerization neared completion , approximately half of the subunits of pY53 - actin filaments still had bound ATP . Note that polymerization of pY53 - actin is accelerated by spectrin – actin seeds ( compare Fig . 8 C with control curve in Fig . 8 A ) , which nucleate polymerization by binding to the pointed end , thus blocking pointed - end elongation while making more barbed ends available for growth . In contrast to the differences in their polymerization properties , we observed no difference in the activation of myosin II subfragment 1 ( S1 ) ATPase by polymer - ized phosphorylated and unphosphorylated actin ( Fig . 8 D ) . Electron Microscopy of Polymerized Actin . In contrast to the typical long ( (cid:2) 2 (cid:1) m ) filaments of unphosphorylated actin ( Fig . 9 A ) , negatively stained images of polymerized pY53 - actin revealed either short , 15 - to 16 - nm bars ( Fig . 9 B ) or a mixture of short bars and filaments with obvious breaks ( Fig . 9 C ) . Because the reduced viscosities of unphosphorylated and pY53 - actin were the same , 6 . 8 and 6 . 6 dl (cid:2) g , respectively , it seems most likely that pY53 - actin forms unstable filaments that partially or completely disassemble to small rods during negative staining . Polymerized pY53 - actin is stabilized by myosin S1 , appearing as typical long , decorated filaments ( Fig . 9 D ) . Filaments of pY53 - actin are also stabilized by phalloidin ( data not shown ) . Discussion Tyr - 53 is immediately adjacent to the hydrophobic DNase I - binding loop ( 11 ) , residues 40 – 50 ( 12 ) of subdomain 2 , which is also implicated in actin – actin ( 12 – 14 ) interactions . Several studies have shown that proteolytic cleavage ( 15 , 16 ) of the DNase I - binding loop or chemical modification of neighboring residues Lys - 61 ( 17 – 19 ) and Tyr - 69 ( 20 ) reduce actin’s affinity for DNase I and inhibit polymerization , which is reversed by phalloidin . More directly relevant to this article , chemical mod - ification of Tyr - 53 by reaction with diazonium tetrazole also blocks polymerization ( 21 ) , which is not reversed by phalloidin ( 20 ) . The effects of phosphorylation of Tyr - 53 reported in this article are similar to the effects of chemical modification of Tyr - 53 and neighboring residues , at least to the much more limited extent to which the chemically modified actins have been studied . The important difference , of course , is that Tyr - 53 phosphorylation of Dictyostelium actin is a regulated , reversible biological response to developmental and environmental signals . From the data in Fig . 8 , Tyr - 53 phosphorylation seems principally to inhibit nucleation and elongation at the pointed end , which could be due to an increase in the dissociation rate or a decrease in the association rate constant at the pointed end Fig . 5 .

When polymerization was induced by Arp2 (cid:2) 3 - VCA , which initiates elongation of branching filaments after binding to existing filaments ( 22 ) , both nucleation and elongation of pY53 - actin filaments were appreciably slower than for unphosphory - lated actin . This finding might suggest that Arp2 (cid:2) 3 - VCA has reduced affinity for the pointed end of pY53 - actin or Arp2 (cid:2) 3 - VCA binds more poorly to filaments of pY53 - actin or both . However , the much slower nucleation ( control curves in Fig . 8 A and B ) and , therefore , the reduced number of pY53 - actin filaments , which are a prerequisite for Arp2 (cid:2) 3 - VCA - induced branching , might also contribute to the slower elongation rate . This explanation would be consistent with the autocatalytic nature of Arp2 (cid:2) 3 - VCA - induced elongation in Fig . 8 A . Because the extent of Arp2 (cid:2) 3 - VCA - nucleated polymerization was very similar for phosphorylated and unphosphorylated actin , Tyr - 53 phosphorylation apparently has little or no effect on the critical concentration at the barbed end . The initial rates of spectrin – actin - nucleated elongation of phosphorylated and unphosphor - ylated actin ( Fig . 8 C ) indicate that the association rate constant at the barbed end for pY53 - actin is (cid:1) 20 – 25 % of the association rate for unphosphorylated actin and , if the critical concentra - tions are the same , there would be a similar difference in the dissociation rate constants . How might phosphorylation of Tyr - 53 affect actin polymer - ization ? Crystallographic studies of monomeric actin indicate that release of the (cid:2) - phosphate of ATP initiates a series of conformational changes that results in conversion of the disor - dered DNase I - binding loop of G - ATP - actin to an (cid:3) - helix in G - ADP - actin ( 23 , 24 ) . Molecular dynamic simulations of actin oligomers and filaments ( 25 ) are consistent with a model in which the helical loop of the ADP - actin subunit weakens actin – actin interactions in trimeric nuclei and in F - actin , leading to destabilization of both . Tyr - 53 phosphorylation might lock the DNase I - binding loop in a conformation that both inhibits ATP hydrolysis accompanying polymerization and weakens actin – actin interactions , particularly at the pointed end . The latter could inhibit nucleation , increase the critical concentration at the pointed end , inhibit interaction between actin and Arp2 (cid:2) 3 - VCA , and destabilize filaments . Inhibition of actin polymerization , destabilization of actin filaments , and inhibition of Arp2 (cid:2) 3 - VCA - induced branching are consistent with the morphological changes that accompany phosphorylation of actin in live amoebae , but tyrosine phos - phorylation might also induce cytoskeletal changes by affecting the interaction of actin with proteins other than Arp2 (cid:2) 3 . In addition , the slower rate of ATP hydrolysis by polymerized pY53 - actin might significantly reduce treadmilling , which is important for actin - based motile processes . On the other hand , the properties of purified pY53 - actin would seem to be inconsistent with the high content of pY53 - actin ( 50 % ) in polymerized actin in viable spores . However , the actin in spores is in 2 - (cid:1) m - long , 100 - to 200 - nm - wide rods , each containing six hexagonally cross - linked tubules , each of which contains three actin filaments ( 4 , 26 , 27 ) . The unknown actin - binding proteins in these structures might interact preferentially with pY53 - actin . The increase in pY53 - actin when vegetative amoebae are exposed to PAO is detectable within 10 min or less , and reaches a maximum of (cid:1) 40 % of total actin in (cid:1) 60 min ( unpublished observations ) . The simplest explanation would be that PAO inhibits an actin tyrosine phosphatase , thus disrupting the steady - state balance between actin phosphorylation and de - phosphorylation . Alternatively , PAO may affect the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of a regulator protein , which , depend - ing on its phosphorylation state , either activates or represses the actin tyrosine kinase . The Dictyostelium genome contains per - haps three protein tyrosine kinases ( 28 ) and 65 – 70 tyrosine kinase - like kinases ( 28 , 29 ) . Three tyrosine kinases , Zak1 , Zak2 , and PkyA , can be eliminated as possible components of the actin tyrosine phosphorylation pathway , because addition of PAO to their respective null cells increases pY53 - actin just as in wild - type cells ( unpublished results ) . Does pY53 - actin occur in other organisms ? Thus far , we have found no evidence for pY - actin in mammalian cells ( HeLa , Cos7 , Fig . 8 .

Materials and Methods Cell Culture . AX3 cells were grown in suspension culture in HL5 medium at 21°C . Cells were starved by washing and resuspending in 17 mM phosphate buffer ( pH 6 . 2 ) for 4 h and developed to fruiting bodies as described ( 32 ) . Actin tyrosine phosphorylation was increased by the addition of 100 (cid:1) M CdCl 2 , 1 mM NaN 3 , or 45 (cid:1) M PAO ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) ( final concentrations ) or heating at 37°C for 60 min . Purification of Phosphorylated and Unphosphorylated Actin . Dictyo - stelium ( AX3 ) amoebae were grown in 20 liters of HL5 medium in 20 4 - liter flasks at room temperature to a cell density of 1 (cid:3) 10 7 cells per ml , 45 (cid:1) M PAO and 1 mM NaN 3 ( final concen - trations ) were added , and the cells were harvested by centrifu - gation after 40 min . The cells ( typically 300 g ) were washed with 10 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) , resuspended in 2 ml (cid:2) g of G - buffer ( 3 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT , and 1 mM PMSF ) containing Roche ( Indianapolis , IN ) applied protease inhibitor ( 1 tablet per 50 ml ) , and stored at (cid:4) 70°C . As needed , 150 g of frozen cells was thawed in an additional 300 ml of G - buffer containing protease inhibitor , ruptured in a Parr bomb , and centrifuged at 160 , 000 (cid:3) g for 1 h , and the superna - tant was chromatographed on a DEAE 52 column as described ( 33 ) . Fractions shown to contain actin by SDS (cid:2) PAGE were pooled , and actin was precipitated by adding solid NH 4 SO 4 to 50 % saturation . NH 4 SO 4 precipitation was used , rather than polymerization ( 33 ) , to avoid loss of phosphorylated actin , which polymerizes less well than unphosphorylated actin . Protein was collected by centrifugation , dissolved in 20 ml of G - buffer , and centrifuged at 90 , 000 (cid:3) g for 10 min , and the supernatant ( in 8 - ml aliquots ) was chromatographed on a 26 (cid:3) 60 Sephacryl HR column . Fractions containing actin were further purified and concentrated by FPLC on a Mono Q HR 10 (cid:2) 10 column , and fractions containing actin were pooled and the actin precipitated with 50 % saturated NH 4 SO 4 . The actin was dissolved in 16 ml of G - buffer and clarified by centrifugation , and the supernatant was chromatographed again on a 26 (cid:3) 60 Sephacryl HR column . Separation of Phosphorylated and Unphosphorylated Actin . Phos - phorylated and unphosphorylated actin were separated by FPLC on a Mono P 5 (cid:2) 200 GL column as described ( 9 ) , with some essential modifications . For complete separation , no more than 2 – 2 . 5 mg of protein was applied to a column equilibrated with 10 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) containing 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM ATP , and 1 mM DTT . Actin was eluted with a gradient of 0 – 500 mM KCl in 120 ml of the same buffer , collecting fractions of 0 . 5 ml , and fractions containing unphosphorylated and phosphorylated actins were identified by SDS (cid:2) PAGE and immunoblotting . The phosphorylated actin from multiple columns was pooled , dia - lyzed against G - buffer , and concentrated by binding to and eluting from a Mono P column . Phosphorylated and unphos - phorylated actin ( 5 and 25 mg , respectively , from 300 g of cells ) were dialyzed against G - buffer overnight in a cold room . Mass Spectrometric Analysis . Alkylation and Lys - C digestion of actin and pY - actin were performed as described ( 34 ) . The parent molecules and digests were analyzed by reverse - phase chroma - tography on a narrow - bore C 18 column ( Vydac , Hesperia , CA ) and by mass spectrometric analysis as described ( 35 ) , except that the instrument was an Agilent Technologies ( Palo Alto , CA ) model 1100 HPLC coupled to an Agilent Technologies model G1969A mass spectrometer with a time - of - flight detector . The flow rates of the column eluate and of the added neat acetic acid were both 20 (cid:1) l (cid:2) min . Actin Polymerization . pY53 - actin and unphosphorylated actin , at the indicated concentrations , containing 4 % pyrene - labeled actin , with or without addition of spectrin – actin ( 36 ) , gelsolin ( Sigma ) - actin seeds ( 37 ) or Arp2 (cid:2) 3 - VCA ( Cytoskeleton , Den - ver , CO ) ( 38 ) , was polymerized at room temperature in G - buffer by the addition of 100 mM KCl and 2 mM MgCl 2 ( final concentrations ) . The increase in fluorescence was measured with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 407 nm . ATPase Activity . Actin - activated ATPase activity of Dictyostelium myosin II S1 ( 32 ) , 150 nM , was assayed in 20 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM KCl , and 2 mM [ 32 P ] ATP by measuring the production of 32 Pi ( 39 ) after incubation at 30°C for 10 min , during which period , the reaction rates were constant . Electrophoresis . For SDS (cid:2) PAGE , cells were harvested by cen - trifugation , suspended in an equal volume of buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM DTT , and 0 . 1 mM PMSF containing Roche protease inhibitor ; 1 tablet per 50 ml ) and 2 (cid:3) SDS sample buffer , and equivalent samples were electro - phoresed on 10 % gels ( 40 ) . For 2D electrophoresis , which was performed according to the manufacturer’s procedure ( 80 - 6429 - 60 , edition AB ; Amersham Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ ) and ( 3 ) , samples ( 250 (cid:1) l ) containing 20 (cid:1) g of total cell protein or 5 (cid:1) g of purified actin were separated on a 13 - cm , pH 4 – 7 DryStrip ( Cat No . 17 - 6001013 ; Amersham Biosciences ) and , in the second direction , on a 10 % Tris - glycine 2D - well minigel ( EC 6076 Box ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Gels were either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes . Blots were reacted with 1 , 000 - fold - diluted phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody ( clone 4G - 10 ; Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY ) or anti - actin antibody ( A - 2066 ; Sigma ) . Two different antigens were de - tected simultaneously on the same blot by using secondary antibodies labeled with goat IRDye 800 anti - rabbit IgG ( Rock - land Immunochemicals , Gilbertsville , PA ) and Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti - mouse IgG ( Molecular Probes , Carlsbad , CA ) , both at 10 , 000 - fold dilution , visualized at 800 and 700 nm , respectively , with the Odyssey infrared imaging system ( LI - COR Biosciences , Lincoln , NE ) . Fluorescence Microscopy . Indirect immunofluorescence micros - copy was performed as described ( 41 ) . For localization of pY - actin , cells were fixed for 5 min in (cid:4) 20°C methanol contain - ing 1 % formalin , incubated with 100 - fold - diluted anti - phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody ( 4G - 10 ; Upstate Biotech - nology ) , followed by 750 - fold - diluted FITC - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( Molecular Probes ) . For localization of F - actin and pY - actin after staining with antibodies , cells were incubated with 500 - fold - diluted rhodamine phalloidin ( R - 415 ; Molecular Probes ) . Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss ( Thorn - wood , NY ) LSM - 510 laser scanning fluorescence microscope equipped with a Plan apoX63 oil objective . Electron Microscopy . Actin was polymerized in the presence of 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 5 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 5 ) . One drop of the filament suspension ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 mg (cid:2) ml ) was placed on a formvar (cid:2) carbon - coated , 400 - mesh copper grid previously glow discharged for 30 s in an EMScope TB500 ( Emscope Labora - tories , Ashford , U . K . ) . After 1 min , the excess liquid was absorbed with filter paper . The grid was stained with a drop of 0 . 5 – 0 . 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 s , the excess stain was removed with filter paper , and the sample was observed in a 13698 (cid:1) www . pnas . org (cid:2) cgi (cid:2) doi (cid:2) 10 . 1073 (cid:2) pnas . 0606321103 Liu et al . JEM - 1200EX II transmission electron microscope ( JEOL , Tokyo , Japan ) . Other Procedures and Materials . Dictyostelium S1 was purified by FLAG - affinity chromatography as described ( 32 ) and stored in liquid N 2 until use . S1 concentrations were determined by absorption at 280 nm by using an extinction coefficient of 0 . 7 cm 2 (cid:2) mg and by the Bradford assay , with the same results . Actin concentrations were determined by absorption at 290 nm by using an extinction coefficient of 0 . 62 cm 2 (cid:2) ml . Pyrene ( Mo - lecular Probes ) labeling of actin was carried out as described ( 42 ) . DNase I activity was assayed by monitoring OD 260 after adding Sigma DNA ( 50 (cid:1) g (cid:2) ml ) to a solution containing 0 . 7 nM Sigma DNase I ( final concentrations ) and various concentra - tions of G - actin in 10 mM Tris ( pH 8 ) , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , and 1 mM NaN 3 . Viscosities were measured at 24°C in a falling - ball viscometer containing 2 ml of actin polymerized overnight at 24°C in 100 mM KCl and 2 mM MgCl 2 . Buffer flow time was 65 s .
