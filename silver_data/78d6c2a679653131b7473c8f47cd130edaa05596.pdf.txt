Hunter 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 * , Li He 4 , Norbert Perrimon 4 , Guillaume Charras 5 , 6 , Edward Giniger 1 * and Buzz Baum 2 , 3 Abstract Background : Notch - Delta signaling functions across a wide array of animal systems to break symmetry in a sheet of undifferentiated cells and generate cells with different fates , a process known as lateral inhibition . Unlike many other signaling systems , however , since both the ligand and receptor are transmembrane proteins , the activation of Notch by Delta depends strictly on cell - cell contact . Furthermore , the binding of the ligand to the receptor may not be sufficient to induce signaling , since recent work in cell culture suggests that ligand - induced Notch signaling also requires a mechanical pulling force . This tension exposes a cleavage site in Notch that , when cut , activates signaling . Although it is not known if mechanical tension contributes to signaling in vivo , others have suggested that this is how endocytosis of the receptor - ligand complex contributes to the cleavage and activation of Notch . In a similar way , since Notch - mediated lateral inhibition at a distance in the dorsal thorax of the pupal fly is mediated via actin - rich protrusions , it is possible that cytoskeletal forces generated by networks of filamentous actin and non - muscle myosin during cycles of protrusion extension and retraction also contribute to Notch signaling . Results : To test this hypothesis , we carried out a detailed analysis of the role of myosin II - dependent tension in Notch signaling in the developing fly and in cell culture . Using dynamic fluorescence - based reporters of Notch , we found that myosin II is important for signaling in signal sending and receiving cells in both systems — as expected if myosin II - dependent tension across the Notch - Delta complex contributes to Notch activation . While myosin II was found to contribute most to signaling at a distance , it was also required for maximal signaling between adjacent cells that share lateral contacts and for signaling between cells in culture . Conclusions : Together these results reveal a previously unappreciated role for non - muscle myosin II contractility in Notch signaling , providing further support for the idea that force contributes to the cleavage and activation of Notch in the context of ligand - dependent signaling , and a new paradigm for actomyosin - based mechanosensation . Background The actin cytoskeleton plays a major role in the regulation of cell shape and tissue organization in animals [ 1 ] , and as such is tightly regulated in space and time downstream of many gene regulatory networks and signaling cascades [ 2 , 3 ] . Conversely , recent work has shown that actin - based protrusions and the forces generated in the actomyosin cortex can also influence the ability of cells to send and re - ceive signals from their environment [ 4 , 5 ] . This realization spawned the field of mechanotransduction [ 6 ] . In considering how mechanical forces might influence cell behavior , it has been proposed that the application of force to a transmembrane protein complex that is coupled to the cytoskeleton leads to a tension - dependent conform - ational change . This exposes hidden sites in one or more mechanosensitive proteins that are then read in order to initiate a signal [ 7 ] . While few signaling systems other than cell - cell and cell - ECM contacts have been shown to be force sensi - tive , recent work has implicated mechanical force in the activation of Notch receptor [ 7 – 12 ] . In cell culture , pull - ing forces of between 3 . 5 and 5 . 5 pN are required to ex - pose the S2 site of Notch required for cleavage and Notch activation . Importantly , although it is not yet pos - sible to accurately determine levels of tension experienced by Notch - Delta complexes in vivo , this phenomenon is thought to explain the requirement for actin - mediated endocytosis in Notch signaling , whereby * Correspondence : ghunter @ clarkson . edu ; ginigere @ ninds . nih . gov 1 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke , NIH , Bethesda , MD 20892 , USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the article © The Author ( s ) . 2019 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4 . 0 International License ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by / 4 . 0 / ) , which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided you give appropriate credit to the original author ( s ) and the source , provide a link to the Creative Commons license , and indicate if changes were made .

However , it is also clear that the actomyosin cytoskeleton itself — whether through the activity of protrusions , at the cell cortex , or elsewhere in the cell — generates contractile forces that could influence signaling . In fact , it is hard to understand how endocytosis could generate the force necessary to unfold Notch in the absence of a rigid or contractile actomyosin cortex upon which to pull and / or push against . These considerations raise the question of whether there are instances in which forces generated by the actomyosin cytoskeleton contribute to the activation of Notch [ 15 – 17 ] . As a specific system in which to test this general idea , we used the fly notum [ 18 – 20 ] , taking of advantage of the fact that epithelial cells in this tissue engage in local Notch - Delta signaling via lateral cell - cell contacts and signaling at a distance , which is mediated by long actin - rich protrusions . Since Notch signaling in - fluences the decision of cells to assume a bristle or epi - thelial fate , this process of lateral inhibition leads to the emergence of a pattern of well - spaced bristles . In the Drosophila pupal notum , the activation of Notch is induced via contact with a neighboring cell expressing Delta . This represses the pro - neural fate so that epithelial cells in which Notch is activated tend to remain epithelial in character [ 18 , 20 ] . Conversely , the maintenance of low levels of Notch activation during this window of develop - ment allows the expression of pro - neural genes , which drive cells towards a mechanosensory bristle fate . Here , we investigate the role of actomyosin contractility in Notch signaling during this process using a combination of quantitative live cell imaging and genetic manipula - tions . By genetically and pharmacologically modulating myosin II activity in vivo , we demonstrate the presence of actomyosin - based forces between basal cellular protru - sions in an epithelium . At the same time , we show that a robust Notch response requires myosin II - mediated con - tractility in both signal sending and receiving cells in vivo and in a cell culture model of Notch - Delta signaling . These data show that decreased myosin II activity is asso - ciated with defects in Notch - dependent bristle spacing , making clear the importance of actomyosin - based forces in tissue patterning . Results Myosin II activity is required for robust Notch signaling Myosin II motors contribute to the generation of actin - dependent pulling forces to drive a wide range of devel - opmental processes [ 21 – 23 ] . In order to determine whether actomyosin contractility is required for lateral inhibition signaling during notum pattern formation , we asked how decreasing actomyosin tension affects the ac - tivity of a transcriptional reporter of Notch signaling , N sfGFP ( Fig . 1a , b ) [ 24 ] . We measured the average accumulation of GFP over time as a reporter of Notch activity ( hereafter , rate of Notch response ; see the “ Methods ” section for more detail ) . We then used the GAL4 / UAS expression system to perturb the function of non - muscle myosin II in this background . Non - muscle myosin II is a multimeric motor protein complex whose heavy chain is encoded by the Drosophila gene zipper , and regulatory light chain ( RLC ) is encoded by spaghetti squash [ 25 , 26 ] . Previous work showed that loss of func - tion mutations and / or expression of dominant negative derivatives of zipper or RLC leads to phenotypes consist - ent with decreased cortical tension [ 22 , 27 ] . Since ani - mals homozygous mutant for null alleles of zipper ( or spaghetti squash ) are not viable to pupariation , we used tissue - specific expression of constructs designed to per - turb myosin II function in specific populations of cells to assess the impact of myosin II on Notch signaling in the notum . These include Zipper DN , a motor - less heavy chain protein that binds and sequesters wild - type heavy chain , thus lowering contractility [ 22 ] , a non - phosphorylatable variant of the RLC , spaghetti squash AA [ 27 ] , or RNAi - mediated silencing of Rho kinase ( ROK ) , an upstream activator of myosin II contractility [ 28 ] . In our experiments , we find that these constructs are asso - ciated with phenotypes of varying severity . The expres - sion of Zipper DN was associated with the strongest phenotypes , followed by spaghetti squash AA , while the expression of RNAi constructs had the least severe ef - fect . This is consistent with the known ability of these reagents to disrupt myosin activity : RNAi constructs are the weakest , in part due to the long - half - life of targeted proteins ( especially Zipper ) ; spaghetti squash AA blocks activation of myosin and has an intermediate effect , whereas Zipper DN is a powerful dominant negative that prevents assembly of endogenous myosin II . In order to reduce myosin II activity , we expressed UAS - spaghetti squash AA or UAS - ROK RNAi in signal sending cells ( SOP cells , using neuralized - GAL4 ) or in both signal sending and receiving cells ( using pannier - GAL4 ) [ 29 , 30 ] . Strikingly , reducing myosin II activity in signal sending cells was sufficient to decrease the rate of the Notch response in adjacent , wild - type neighbor cells ( Fig . 1c , d ; Additional file 1 : Figure S1A - B ) , and in distant neighbors that signal to one an - other via basal actin - based protrusions ( Fig . 1b , e , f ; Additional file 1 : Figure S1C ) . Similar effects were ob - served when myosin II activity was simultaneously com - promised in both signal sending and receiving cells ( Fig . 1g – i ; Additional file 1 : Figure S1D - E ) . In this case , the decrease in Notch response was more profound in dis - tant neighbours . These data suggest that myosin II plays a critical role in Notch - Delta signalling , particularly be - tween cells that contact one another via long , basal protrusions . Hunter et al .

BMC Biology ( 2019 ) 17 : 12 Page 3 of 15 To test whether this represents a general role for myosin II in Notch signaling , we used a cell culture model of lat - eral inhibition [ 7 ] . This consists of a mixed populations of Drosophila S2R + cells expressing either a synthetic Notch ligand or receptor . Once these form cell - cell contacts , my - osin II is inhibited by pharmacological inhibitors or dsRNA - mediated knockdown of zipper or spaghetti squash expression ( Fig . 1j – l ) [ 31 ] . A luciferase - based tran - scriptional reporter is then used to measure Notch activ - ity . Importantly , while acute treatment of the ROK inhibitor Y - 27632 altered S2R + cell shape , it did not change expression levels of ligand or receptor ( Fig . 1j ; Additional file 1 : Figure S1F ) . Nevertheless , ligand - induced Notch signaling in this system was reduced by Y - 27632 treatment in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 1k ; Additional file 1 : Figure S1G ) . The role of cortical actomyosin - based tension in Notch signaling was con - firmed using dsRNA - mediated knockdown of zipper or spaghetti squash expression ( Fig . 1l ) . Moreover , by mixing control and dsRNA - treated cells , we showed that the maximal Notch response in this system requires myosin II in both signal sending and receiving cells . These findings support a general role for actomyosin contractility in driv - ing a robust Notch response . Loss of myosin II activity disrupts bristle patterning We monitored bristle density in these flies to test whether these tension - dependent changes in the Notch response are sufficient to induce changes in lateral inhibition tissue pat - terning . Previous research had shown that decreased Notch signaling leads to both the formation of adjacent bristles and to an overall increase in the density of bristles [ 32 ] . The effect of non - muscle Myosin perturbations on pattern - ing was much less severe than this . As a quantitative test of the impact of myosin on Notch - Delta - dependent lateral in - hibition signaling , we measured the spacing between SOP cells in animals with decreased myosin II activity in signal sending cells ( Fig . 2a ) .

BMC Biology ( 2019 ) 17 : 12 Page 4 of 15 myosin II , a treatment that leads to a strong reduction in myosin II activity , was associated with decreased spacing between SOP cells in rows , without altering SOP cell clus - tering ( Fig . 2a – c ) . Similar results were seen in flies express - ing spaghetti squash AA in signal sending cells , leading to a reduction in pattern spacing ( Fig . 2a – c ) . Furthermore , the expression of spaghetti squash AA throughout the notum led to a decrease in bristle spacing ( Fig . 2d , e ) — a phenotype that was most evident in bristle row 1 — but again , not to the formation of SOP cell clusters . Although we did not ob - serve any disruption of the overall notum epithelium organization prior to cell division in animals expressing spaghetti squash AA under pnr - GAL4 , we cannot rule out subtle changes in this case or following the expression of zipper DN . Together , these data suggest actomyosin - based tension has a profound impact on long - range , protrusion - mediated Notch signaling without influencing signalling between cells that interact with one another via lateral contacts . The role of actomyosin contractility in the Notch signaling pathway First , to ask how actomyosin contractility contributes to the activity of the Notch signaling pathway , we consid - ered the possibility that non - muscle myosin II activity is required for the Notch receptor and / or Delta ligand to be presented on the surface of signal sending and receiv - ing cells [ 17 ] . However , when we visualized Notch receptor and Delta ligands in SOP cells , we did not ob - serve myosin - dependent changes in their localization ( Notch - apical and basal puncta ; Delta - cytoplasmic or basal puncta ) or Delta ( cytoplasmic or basal puncta ) ( Additional file 2 : Figure S2 ) . Notch and Delta were also observed along the length of protrusions regardless of myosin II status ( n > 6 nota each genotype ; Fig . 3a – c ) . Thus lowering myosin II activity does not appear to grossly affect the localization of Notch or Delta . Next , we asked whether myosin II activity has an im - pact on basal protrusion morphology or dynamics . This is important , since previous genetic and mathematical modeling data show that reductions in the length or dy - namics ( i . e . , retraction , extension ) of basal protrusions can lead to defects in long - range Notch signaling and , therefore , to decreased SOP cell spacing [ 33 , 34 ] . We used time - lapse confocal microscopy to track the dy - namics of basal protrusions in live SOP cells ( Add - itional file 3 : Movie S1 ) marked using cell - type - specific expression of the filamentous actin reporter GMCA , the GFP - tagged actin binding domain of Moesin ( Fig . 4 ) [ 35 ] . Basal protrusions exhibited cycles of extension and retraction with a period of ~ 10 min , with an average maximum length of 10 μ m , consistent with previously published data [ 33 ] . Protrusions changed shape prior to and during retraction ( Additional file 3 : Movie S1 ) through a process reminiscent of helical buckling ob - served in mechanically active filopodia in cell culture a b c Fig . 3 Localization of Notch and Delta .

Scale bar , 5 μ m and 2 μ m . See also Additional file 2 : Figure S2 Hunter et al . BMC Biology ( 2019 ) 17 : 12 Page 5 of 15 [ 36 ] . Importantly , however , the behavior of protrusions appeared similar in both control and spaghetti squash AA expressing tissues ( Additional file 4 : Movie S2 ) , and their morphology was unaffected by the expression of spa - ghetti squash AA ( Fig . 4a – c ) . However , when we induced a strong loss of myosin II activity via expression of the dominant negative construct , we observed changes in the length and morphology of protrusions ( e . g . , bulbous tips , fanning ) ( Fig . 4d , d ’ ) , similar to those seen following myosin inhibition in cell culture [ 37 ] . We conclude that while decreased myosin II activity can lead to protrusion defects , the incidence of these defects does not correlate with the reduction in protrusion - mediated long - range Notch signaling that we observed in animals expressing spaghetti squash AA . Actomyosin contractility and endocytosis influence Notch signaling in distinct ways How might the actomyosin cortex influence Notch sig - naling ? Endocytosis requires deformation of the cell cortex , whose stiffness is regulated by actomyosin contractility [ 38 , 39 ] . At the same time , the forces generated during ligand internalization have been proposed to drive the mechanical activation of Notch receptor [ 7 , 9 , 40 ] . This made it important to test whether the impact of actomyosin contractility on signaling and on lateral - inhibition patterning in vivo functions through its effects on endocytosis . To do so , we first examined the ability of cells with re - duced myosin II activity to endocytose Delta ligand using a ligand uptake assay [ 41 ] . Delta - positive puncta were ob - served in both control and zipper DN expressing cells with - out these being a visible difference in the numbers of these puncta ( Additional file 5 : Figure S3A ) . We next used dsRNA to silence known regulators of Delta endocytosis and myosin II activity to determine how the two effects combine to influence long - range Notch signaling . Decreased Delta endocytosis in SOP cells , induced by RNAi - mediated silencing of the epsin liquid facets ( lqf ) [ 42 ] , led to a slight increase in the numbers of SOP cell clusters ( 10 . 7 ± 3 . 8 SOP pairs per LqfRNAi nota vs 4 . 5 ± 1 . 8 SOP pairs per control nota , N ≥ 3 nota each genotype ; Additional file 5 : Figure S3B - E ) , which is consistent with the requirement for epsins in Notch - Delta signalling ( Note this phenotype differs from that seen following reductions in myosin II activity ) [ 40 , 42 ] . We then combined these perturbations While the animals expressing dsRNAs that target each system alone had weak bristle patterning defects ( Fig . 5a ) , when we co - expressed zipper - and lqf - RNAi in SOP cells ( using tubulin - GAL80 ts to temporally control RNAi ex - pression so that the animals remained viable ) , we ob - served severe patterning defects . These appeared to be a combination of the two phenotypes observed in the sin - gle mutants , i . e . , there was an increase in the variability of bristle spacing together with an enhanced number of GFP - positive cell clusters relative to the expression of ei - ther RNAi alone ( Fig . 5a , b ; Additional file 5 : Figure S3F ) . These data support the idea that Delta ligand endocytosis and myosin II activity act in distinct ways to impact Notch signaling in vivo via lateral and protrusion - mediated signaling , respectively . This result was further supported by experiments per - formed in cell culture using the synthetic Notch system , where we perturbed both myosin II activity and endocytosis via dsRNA and pharmacological inhibition ( Fig . 5c - d ; Additional file 1 : Figure S1H ) . As previously published , Dynasore , an inhibitor of dynamin - mediated endocytosis [ 43 ] , decreases Notch activation in this sys - tem [ 7 ] . Strikingly , when Dynasore was used in combin - ation with Y - 27632 , we observed a further reduction in Notch response ( Fig . 5c ) . Moreover , additive effects were a b d d’ c Fig . 4 Effect of decreased myosin II activity on protrusion dynamics and morphology . ( a ) For the listed genotypes , we measured maximum protrusion length ( from cell body to tip ) , rate of extension ( time to maximum length ) , rate of retraction ( time to disappearance into cell body ) , and protrusion lifetime . ( b – d ′ ) Live imaging of SOP cells in nota of the indicated genotype show that overexpressing sqh AA does not appear to affect basal protrusion morphology , but overexpression of zipperDN does lead to abnormal protrusion shapes .

BMC Biology ( 2019 ) 17 : 12 Page 6 of 15 observed in experiments in which we used dsRNAs to target either zipper or spaghetti squash expression in sig - nal sending or receiving cells in the presence or absence of Dynasore ( Fig . 5d ) . Again , these data point to myosin II activity and endocytosis having distinct functions in the regulation of Notch signaling . Interacting protrusions are under mechanical tension While the apical actomyosin cytoskeleton is known to control many aspects of notum cell biology [ 21 , 30 , 44 ] , little is known about its impact on basal protrusions . If myosin II were to contribute to Notch signaling by enab - ling protrusions that make adhesive contacts to exert forces on one another , several preconditions would have to be met . Myosin II would have to be ( i ) present and active within the basal domain of cells and ( ii ) generate pulling forces between these protrusions . When we im - aged myosin II in the basal - most focal plane of the tissue using the Venus - tagged myosin II heavy chain gene trap [ 45 ] , myosin II was visible along the length of protru - sions and at their base , where it co - localized with fila - mentous actin ( Fig . 6a – a ″ ) . In order to determine whether this basal myosin II pool is likely to generate forces we imaged phosphorylated endogenous RLC ( pMRLC , phospho - myosin regulatory light chain [ 27 ] ) . We observed pMRLC ( and thus active myosin II ) local - ized in clumps at the base of protrusions in SOP cells ( Fig . 6b – b ″ ; Additional file 6 : Figure S4A ) . These data are consistent with models in which the contractile acto - myosin meshwork at the base of cellular protrusions contributes to retrograde flow , amplifying actin tread - milling within the protrusion [ 46 , 47 ] . Having established the presence of myosin II in and at the base of protrusions , we wanted to assess the extent of contacts between the basal domain of cells in the notum . These can be visualized using the GRASP system ( GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners ) [ 48 ] . Membrane - bound GFP 1 – 10 was expressed in signal re - ceiving cells ( via pnr - GAL4 ) and GFP 11 in signal sending cells ( via ase - LexA , with LexAOp - GAL80 to inhibit GAL4 activity ) , so that the reconstituted GFP fluores - cence would be visible only when the two cell types came into contact with one another ( Fig . 6c ; Additional file 6 : Figure S4B ) . In control tissues expressing GFP 1 – 10 , we observed background levels of fluorescence ( Fig . 6 c ′ ) . In control tissues where all cells express both GFP 1 – 10 and GFP 11 , we observe that all cell membranes fluoresce , in - cluding the nuclear envelope ( Fig . 6c ″ ) .

BMC Biology ( 2019 ) 17 : 12 Page 7 of 15 we assessed the ability of single GFP11 cells to contact their neighbours , we saw that basal cell - cell contacts are not restricted to protrusion tips , but are extensive and run along the length of the protrusions ( Fig . 6c ) . These data indicate that protrusions form a network of basal cell - cell contacts that effectively extend the range of physical con - tact between cells in the notum to 2 – 3 cell diameters , as suggested previously [ 33 ] . In line with this , when we imaged the full set of pro - trusions in vivo using pannier - GAL4 to express UAS - LifeAct Ruby in both signal sending and receiving cells in the notum , we observed a complex network of protrusions that criss - crossed the basal surface of the epithelium ( Fig . 7a ) . These networks fluctuate in density over time ( Additional file 7 : Movie S3 ) . During the window of observation , particle image velocimetry ( PIV ) [ 49 ] re - vealed that the basal domain is in constant flux ( Fig . 7a , b ) , without there being evidence for tissue - wide polarity . Im - portantly , this movement was dependent on actomyosin contractility , since it was markedly reduced by treatment with Y - 27632 [ 29 ] . Acute treatment with Y - 27632 led to a steady decrease in the pulsatile movement of basal cell - cell contacts over a period of a few minutes ( Fig . 7c , d ) . These data suggest that basal contacts transmit forces between cells which depend on myosin II . Finally , to test whether these basal protrusion contacts are subject to mechanical tension tension , we performed laser ablation to disrupt them .

BMC Biology ( 2019 ) 17 : 12 Page 8 of 15 we made ~ 10 - μ m cuts within the basal surface of the notum , disrupting the protrusion network without af - fecting more apical planes ( Fig . 7e ) . Cuts induced a rapid recoil , followed by a slower relaxation , as expected for tissues under tension . When we expressed the spaghetti squash AA construct under the pnr - GAL4 driver to re - duce myosin II activity throughout the notum , we observed a twofold decrease in the mean initial re - coil velocity , from 6 . 6 ± 2 . 5 μ m / s ( mean ± SD , n = 35 cuts , 10 pupae ; Fig . 7f ) to 3 . 6 ± 1 . 0 μ m / s ( n = 22 cuts , 8 pupae ; p < 0 . 0001 , unpaired t test ) . Taken to - gether , these data support a model in which myosin II - dependent tension in basal contacts that connect epithelial cells in the notum facilitate robust activa - tion of Notch response during pattern formation in the notum . Discussion In Drosophila , the pattern of bristles on the dorsal thorax of the fly is set up by Notch - Delta signaling through a process of lateral inhibition [ 50 ] . As we show here , this signalling is facilitated by both actomyosin contractility and Epsin - mediated endocytosis [ 14 ] . While a reduction in myosin II activity in signal sending cells is not sufficient to induce adjacent cells to adopt the SOP cell fate , in combination with reductions in Epsin func - tion , we observe frequent SOP cell clusters . This sug - gests that Notch signaling in adjacent neighbors depends on both myosin II - mediated contraction and Epsin - me - diated endocytosis forces . The two systems could well work in tandem , since cortical actomyosin may function as a platform that the endocytic machinery can use to exert forces .

Here , reductions in myosin II activity are sufficient to lead to aberrant cell fate decision making and decreased spacing between SOP cells . For this model of Notch activation to work [ 33 , 34 , 51 , 52 ] would require that ( i ) Notch and Delta localize to protrusions ; ( ii ) that protrusions have physical interactions ; ( iii ) that these protrusion interactions are subject to tension , in order to activate Notch receptor . Here we show that each of these conditions is met . How might Notch receptor be activated on protru - sions ? Our data suggests that one way this could occur is through the contact , engagement , and retraction of basal protrusions in Notch and Delta expressing cells . Importantly , since the contact area between protrusions can be extensive , Notch / Delta signaling molecules local - ized along the protrusions could potentially contribute to signal activation . In addition , when contact has been made , the ligand and receptor could diffuse along the length of the protrusion and become trapped at the site of contact — as suggested previously [ 53 ] . Once Notch and Delta have become engaged , actomyosin - dependent extension / retraction cycles could provide shear forces parallel to the plasma membrane that contribute to the activation of Notch . Alternatively , Notch could be acti - vated by the simple pulling of protrusions on one an - other . Filopodia are able to exert pulling forces on their environment up to ~ 1 nN [ 36 , 54 ] , which is more than sufficient to activate Notch receptor and much higher than the forces associated with endocytosis [ 40 , 55 ] . One caveat of our work is that , although we did not observe any change in basal Notch or Delta localization in cells with lowered levels of actomyosin contractility , due to the relatively low levels of basally localized Notch and Delta , we cannot rule out an effect . Development of next generation Notch activity reporters that allow the rapid visualization of local receptor activation in vivo will be necessary to reveal the mechanical details of Notch sig - naling in cellular protrusions . While our data do not rule out the possibility that endo - cytosis contributes directly to protrusion - mediated Notch activation . However , the structure of filopodial - like pro - trusions , with bundled actin closely associated with the plasma membrane , may be refractory to endocytosis . In - deed there is evidence for the existence of endosomal ‘ hot spots ’ at the base of cellular protrusions rather than along them [ 56 ] . A closer analysis of the ultrastructure of basal protrusions could help to reveal the impact of local struc - ture on the numbers of endocytic pits formed . How much does protrusion - mediated Notch - Delta signaling contribute to the cell fate decision making process of epithelial cells ? Previously , it was shown that stochastic noise can be a feature of signaling mechanisms and contribute to the plasticity of bristle patterning [ 57 ] . More generally , stochastic amplification of noisy signals , especially as part of signaling feedback loops , can drive bistable systems in both models and bio - logical systems [ 58 – 61 ] . This means that the amount of signaling protein present on basal protrusions is likely suf - ficient to induce changes in cell fate : when two cells begin - ning to downregulate Notch response and upregulate pro - neural genes are “ too close , ” i . e . , within range of each other ’ s basal protrusions , we commonly observe switching away from the SOP fate in at least one of them . Thus , the long - range Delta signal , amplified through the feedback mechanisms which exist to reinforce Notch - mediated cell fate decisions [ 62 , 63 ] , is likely sufficient to impose the epithelial fate , even if these proteins are found concen - trated at lateral cell - cell contacts [ 33 , 64 ] . Recent evidence shows that the patterning of bristle rows begins developing in the notum far earlier than 12 h APF , where we begin our analysis [ 65 ] . Although we have observed basal protrusions in fixed nota as early as 9 h APF ( unpublished data ) , technical challenges prevent us from being able to perform our live analysis of Notch dy - namics prior to 12 h APF . Corson et al . also suggests that bristle patterning terminates prior to 12 h APF ; however , our data clearly show that completion of lateral inhibi - tion - dependent decision making is , at least in some cells , a temporally extended process [ 66 ] and these fate choices remain plastic as late as 12 h APF in wild - type animals . Given that myosin II is able to alter Notch - Delta signaling in cell culture and in vivo , and given the prevalence of protrusions in biological systems [ 67 ] , it will be important in the future to determine whether actomyosin - dependent protrusion - mediated Notch signaling plays much more general roles in tissue development and homeostasis than currently appreciated . Conclusion Our results show that actomyosin contractility plays a role in Notch signaling both in a cell culture model of signaling and in bristle patterning in the developing fly . By tuning the activity of myosin II to affect contractility without affecting protrusion dynamics and morphology , we show that protrusion interactions are subject to con - tractile forces and that myosin II activity is required for robust signaling between cells whose only contact is via basal protrusions . Our data also show that , actomyosin contractility in cells that contact one another through extensive lateral contacts promotes the Notch . In these cells endocytosis and myosin - dependent pulling may both contribute to force - dependent Notch activation . These results add to our understanding of protrusion - mediated signaling in the patterning of self - organized tissues . Importantly , they also suggest a new mechanism of mechanotransduction via which Hunter et al .

Transfected cells were cultured for 10 days to allow efficient knock - down of target genes . Signal sending and receiv - ing cells were washed twice with fresh culture medium , suspended , and mixed together in 1 : 1 ratio . Cells were cultured for an additional day before screening luciferase activity ( Steady - Glo Luciferase Assay Kit , Promega ) using a SpectraMax Paradigm Multi - Mode Microplate Reader . For Dynasore treatment , transfected cells were washed twice by culture medium , incubated with medium containing 60 μ M Dynasore and / or 20 μ M Y - 27632 ( final concentration ) for 1 h . Cells were resus - pended , mixed in 1 : 1 ratio , and cultured for an add - itional day in the presence of Dynasore before luciferase assay . Knock - down efficiency was tested by qPCR . Real - time PCR was performed using iTaq SYBR Green Supermix ( Bio - Rad ) with GAPDH as a control . qPCR : S2R + cells plated in six - well plate were trans - fected with indicated dsRNAi plasmid ( 0 . 6 μ g ) together with pAct - GAl4 ( 0 . 2 μ g ) using Effectene . dsRNA against white used as control . The transfection procedure was repeated two more times every 4 days to maximize transfection efficiency . Total RNA was extracted from S2R + cells after the 3rd transfection using TRIzol Re - agent ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Raw RNA was treated with DNase I , purified by QIAGEN RNeasy kit , and con - verted to cDNA template using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Bio - Rad ) . Y27632 treatment : Cells expressing either synNotch or GFP - ligand were treated with 20 μ M Y - 27632 for 1 h and then mixed and cultured in the presence of 20 μ M Y - 27632 for 1 day before analysis . Quantitative analysis and statistics All statistical analysis was performed in Prism 6 ( Graph - Pad ) . Specific tests used are indicated in the text and fig - ure legends , see Additional file 8 for raw data . Figure 1 : N sfGFP signal was measured as previously de - scribed [ 24 ] . Briefly , the N sfGFP transgene includes a nu - clear localization signal . GFP fluorescence localized to nuclei either adjacent to ( 1 N ) or one cell removed ( 2 N ) from an SOP ( which lack GFP expression ) was measured by drawing an ROI in the nucleus and recording mean intensity for the ROI for each time point until nuclear envelope breakdown ( NEB ) . Since epithelial cells are staggered in their cell fate decision making process , and we previously established that exit from G2 phase of the cell cycle is Notch signaling dependent , we use NEB as a fixed time point for comparison . For the purposes of these graphs , t = 0 at NEB . The data was normalized to the fluorescence at the first time point of the movie ( i . e . , time point closest to 12 h APF ) . Figures 2 and 5 : Mean distance and apical diameter be - tween SOPs was measured in bristle row 2 : an unpro - jected , z - slice image is rotated to align bristle row 2 with 0° axis , an ROI is drawn to encompass all SOPs in row 2 , and the ROI is collapsed along the y - axis to result in a 1D histogram along the bristle row ( x - axis ) . Distance between SOPs is defined as the centroid to centroid distance be - tween signal peaks along the histogram ; apical diameter is defined as the edge - to - edge measurement of a signal peak ( i . e . , where signal reaches 0 ) . To verify that we were only measuring the distance between true SOP cells , we cap - tured 12 h time - lapse movies ( starting at 12 h APF ) . We therefore measured the distance between GFP + cells which become SOPs and not GFP + cells that switch back to epithelial fates . However , in measuring grouping , we measured any GFP + cells adjacent to each other . Figure 4 : Live images were maximum projected . Total length = maximum length from cell - proximal base to tip ; extension rate = time for a protrusion to appear until it reaches maximum length ; retraction rate = time for a pro - trusion to disappear after reaching maximum length ; life - time = total time during which a protrusion is visible . Figure 7 : Particle image velocimetry ( PIV ) was per - formed using the FIJI plugin described in [ 49 ] . Mean vector magnitude ( second iteration ) for the field of view for each time point pair was calculated . The region shown in the micrograph is the full extent of the ana - lyzed area . We chose ROI of consistent area to measure movement . We picked areas of the excised nota that were relatively flat and close to the coverslip — due to the nature of the experiment excised nota sometimes curl up or fold , and we wanted to measure movement in con - tiguous regions of tissue . Mean initial recoil is measured by the average movement / time of ≥ 2 fiducials before and after laser ablation and was performed using the manual spot tracker in Icy [ 71 ] . Supplement : Filopodia dynamics were measured by manually tracing protrusions in z - projected time - lapse images . Myosin localization : basal images ( up to 1 μ m maximum projection ) . ROIs were drawn to include only basal filopodia areas . All other measurements were per - formed as described in main text figures . Additional files Additional file 1 : Figure S1 .

( H ) Basal synNotch activity is affected by transfection of zip and spa - ghetti squash siRNA , but not by acute treatment with Dynasore . However , because fold changes of synNotch activity in the presence of GFP - ligand is calculated based on each treatment respectively , the relative fold changes should still primarily reflect the efficiency of synNotch cleavage under differ - ent conditions .
