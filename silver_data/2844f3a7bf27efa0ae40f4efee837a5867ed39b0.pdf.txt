In vitro studies performed in primary neonatal rat CMF revealed that silencing of C / EBP β expression ( via lentiviral mediated shRNA strategies ) was sufficient to reduce C / EBP β mRNA and protein levels as well as to decrease the expressions of actin cytoskeletal proteins , cofilin , and filamin A ( FLNA ) . TGF β increased IL - 1 β , IL - 6 and TNF - a production in cardiac fibroblasts ( CF ) , while C / EBP β knockdown reduced the secretion of these inflammatory mediators . In vivo studies performed in rats exhibiting EAM revealed that lentiviral - mediated silencing of C / EBP β was sufficient to reduce the expression of C / EBP β as well as inflammation and fibrosis in the hearts of EAM rats , when compared to controls . Echocardiography further revealed that C / EBP β knockdown was sufficient to significantly improve cardiac dimensions and function in EAM rats . Immunohisto - chemical results showed that C / EBP β knockdown attenuated the expression of C / EBP β protein as well as the expressions of collagen I , collagen III , MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , and α - SMA in heart tissue sections from rats in the EAM + Lenti - shC / EBP β group . Strategies targeted at inhibiting C / EBP β expression can be potentially exploited to regulate cofilin and FLNA expression , thereby regulating actin polymerization / depolymerization , cytoskeleton rearrangement , and CF differentiation into CMF and the production of inflammatory cytokines . C / EBP β knock down reduces the degree of inflammation - mediated myocardial fibrosis in a rat model of EAM . ( Int Heart J 2018 ; 59 : 1389 - 1397 ) Key words : Cardiac remodeling , Inflammation , Extracellular matrix , Myofibroblast , α - SMA M yocardial fibrosis is a key cause of heart fail - ure , malignant arrhythmias and other cardio - vascular events . 1 - 3 ) It is characterized as an ac - cumulation of collagen fibers ; a significant increase in collagen concentration , and a change in the composition of collagen components in myocardial tissue . Myocardial fibrosis is a nearly inevitable outcome in end - stage cardio - vascular disease , which results in cardiac structural re - modeling due to excess extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . 4 - 6 ) The ECM is mainly composed of type I and type III collagen . Approximately 85 % of total myocardial collagen is type I , while type III collagen accounts for 11 % of the total col - lagen protein . 7 , 8 ) During fibrosis , quiescent cardiac fibroblasts ( CF ) be - come activated and differentiate into cardiac myofibro - blasts ( CMF ) , which typically express α - smooth muscle actin ( α - SMA ) and acquire the ability to proliferate , mi - grate , and produce ECM . 1 , 9 , 10 ) Fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation is a key process during cardiac remodeling . Transforming growth factor - beta 1 ( TGF - β 1 ) plays an im - portant role in the transdifferentiation of CF into CMF , which is an important mediator of myocardial fibrosis . 11 ) Independent studies have also suggested myocardial in - flammation is a mechanism that also leads to the develop - ment of cardiac fibrosis , 12 - 14 ) and is intimately linked to myocardial fibrosis leading to heart failure . 6 , 13 ) Compelling evidence suggests that C / EBP β is an im - portant regulator of cell proliferation , differentiation and apoptosis , 15 , 16 ) and can also significantly attenuate fibrosis in the liver and lung ; 17 , 18 ) however , the impact and mecha - From the 1 Department of Cardiology , the Fourth Affiliated Hospital , Harbin Medical University , Harbin , PR .

The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of C / EBP β knockdown in primary neonatal rat CF and a rat model of cardiac fibrosis induced by experimental autoim - mune myocarditis ( EAM ) using a lentiviral shRNA ap - proach . Methods C / EBP β lentiviruses : Lentiviruses containing small hair - pin RNA ( shRNA ) ( Lenti - shC / EBP β ) directed against C / EBP β ( shRNA sequence : GAAGAAACGTCTATGTGTA ) were obtained from Genechem ( Shanghai , China ) . Lentivi - rus containing vector was used as control . C / EBP β lentiviral studies in cardiac myofibroblast cul - tures and rat EAM model : For in vitro studies , rat car - diac fibroblasts were isolated from 3 - day - old neonatal Sprague - Dawley rat pups using a differential adhesion method as described previously . 19 ) Cells were centrifuged after digestion and suspended in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium ( DMEM ; Hyclone , Logan , CT ) supple - mented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Hyclone , Lo - gan , CT ) , and then plated on dishes in DMEM at 37 ℃ and 5 % CO 2 . After 1 hour , the adhered CF were cultured in DMEM containing 10 % fetal calf serum ( hyclone ) . The CF were subdivided into 4 groups : ( 1 ) Control group ; CF with no treatment , ( 2 ) Mock group ( TGF β 1 group ) ; CF treated with TGF - β 1 ( 10 ng / mL ) for 72 hours ( to induce the transition from cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts ) , ( 3 ) Vector group ( TGF - β 1 + lentiviral vector group ) ; CF treated with TGF - β 1 ( 10 ng / mL ) and infected with a con - trol lentivirus for 72 hours , and ( 4 ) Lenti - shC / EBP β group ( TGF - β 1 + Lenti - shC / EBP β group ) ; CF treated with TGF - β 1 ( 10 ng / mL ) and infected with a lentivirus harboring a shRNA to C / EBP β for 72 hours , in order to investigate the effect of Lenti - shC / EBP on the transformation of CF into CMF . For in vivo studies , the animals were randomly di - vided into 4 groups ( n = 6 rats / group ) ( 1 ) : Saline group ; injected in the footpad with saline alone , ( 2 ) Negative control group ( EAM group ) ; injected in the footpad with the emulsion and developed myocarditis , ( 3 ) Positive con - trol group ( EAM + Lentiviral Vector ) ; injected in the foot - pad and developed myocarditis and subsequently infected at day 28 with a control lentivirus , and ( 4 ) Experimental group ( EAM + Lenti - shC / EBP β ) ; rats developed myo - carditis and subsequently infected with a lentivirus con - taining a shRNA to C / EBP β . For lentivirus administration , the rats were anaesthetized with chloral hydrate ( 0 . 3 mL / 100 g body weight ) and immobilized to isolate the femo - ral vein for lentiviral injection . Rats were injected in the femoral vein with 0 . 2 mL of a control lentivirus ( 10 8 ) ( SonoVue as carrier ) or a lentivirus harboring shRNA to C / EBP β ( 10 8 ) ( SonoVue as carrier ) using an ultrasound - targeted microbubble gene therapy technique . 20 ) Rats that did not undergo lentiviral injection were not subjected to transthoracic ultrasound irradiation ( Figure 1 ) . In vivo study : Animals and immunization protocol These studies were performed at Harbin Medical University and approved by the Experimental Animal Care and Use Committee of Harbin Medical University . Twenty - four inbred male Le - wis rats ( 5 weeks , 180 - 200 g ) were purchased from Bei - jing Vital River Laboratory Animals Co . Ltd . ( Beijing , China ) and housed under specified pathogen free condi - tions . Cardiac myosin purified from porcine heart ( 9 . 8 mg / L ; Sigma , CO ) was emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund’s adjuvant ( CFA ; Sigma , CO ) , which was supplemented with Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 RA ( Difco , USA ) . Rats were injected with either saline ( Saline ) or this emulsion ( 0 . 2 mL ; EAM ) in the footpad on days 0 and 7 to induce an experimental autoimmune myocarditis model , as described previously . 21 ) Echocardiography Four weeks after lentiviral infection , echocardiography was performed on the rats as described previously . 22 , 23 ) Briefly , the rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and subjected to transthoracic echocardio - grams using a General Electric ( GE , Vivid - 5 ) imaging sys - tem equipped with a 1 . 7 - 3 . 6 MHz multi - frequency trans - ducer in order to measure interventricular septal wall thickness at end diastole ( IVS ) , left ventricular posterior wall thickness ( LVPW ) , left ventricular end diastolic di - ameter ( LVEDD ) , left ventricular end systolic diameter ( LVESD ) , ejection fraction ( EF ) , and fractional shortening ( FS ) . Cardiac histology with HE staining and Masson’s staining Heart tissue was harvested from anesthetized rats . The left ventricles were separated and sectioned transversely into 4 slices from apex to base . All slices were formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded , and sectioned into 5 μm thick sec - tions . Deparaffinized rat heart tissue sections were then subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining or Masson’s trichrome stain according to the manufacturer’s protocols .

Immunohistochemical staining Deparaffinized rat heart tis - sue sections were incubated with 3 % hydrogen peroxide , and then incubated with primary antibodies to C / EBP β ( 1 : 1000 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX ) , MMP - 2 ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , MMP - 9 ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , Col I ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz Biotech - nology ) , Col III ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and α - SMA ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . Subsequently , sections were incubated with a goat anti - mouse - conjugated peroxidase - labeled secondary antibody ( 1 : 1000 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) for 30 minutes at room temperature . Positive signals were visualized using a dia - minobenzidine substrate chromagen solution and hematox - ylin counterstain . In vitro study : Immunofluorescence microscopy analyses CMF were rinsed 3 times with PBS and fixed with 4 % paraformalde - hyde and subjected to 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Beyotime Biotechnology , Shanghai , China ) in PBS for 20 minutes at 20 ℃ . Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and incu - bated with antibodies against cofilin ( 1 : 50 ; Boster , Wuhan , China ) and FLNA ( 1 : 50 ; Sangon , Shanghai , China ) . Fluorophore - tagged secondary antibodies and a fluorescent microscope ( Olympus BX61 ) were utilized for protein visualization and imaging . The fluorescence intensity was analyzed using Image - pro plus 6 . 0 ( Media Cybernetics ) . Quantitative RT - PCR analysis of C / EBP β , cofilin and FLNA mRNA Total RNA was extracted from CMF using TRIzol ( Life Technologies , Rockville , MD ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . cDNA was produced using M - MLV Reverse Transcriptase ( Promega ) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations for oligo ( dT ) 20 or ran - dom hexamer primed cDNA - synthesis . cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 μg of RNA at 40 ℃ . Finally , cDNA was diluted 1 : 5 before use in qPCR . Samples were then subjected to a quantitative polymerase chain reaction using a 7300 Real - Time PCR system ( Applied Biosys - tems ) and specific SYBR green primers ( Table I ; Invitro - gen Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , according to the manufacturer’s protocols . Samples underwent the fol - lowing PCR reaction conditions , which included an initial denaturation stage ( 45 ℃ , 2 minutes ; 95 ℃ , 10 minutes ) followed by 40 cycles , each cycle containing 3 steps ( de - naturation 95 ℃ , 15 s ; annealing 60 ℃ , 1 minutes ; and ex - tension 72 ℃ , 1 minutes ) . Glyceraldehyde phosphate dehy - drogenase ( GAPDH ) was evaluated as an internal control and the quantification of C / EBP - β , FLNA and cofilin mRNA relative to GAPDH was assessed . Each reaction was analyzed in triplicate . Western blot analysis of C / EBP β , LAP , LIP and collagen Protein concentrations of the samples were determined us - ing the Lowry method . 24 ) Proteins ( 50 μg ) were separated by 12 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto ni - trocellulose membranes , which were blocked with TBST buffer containing 5 % skim milk . Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies directed against C / EBP β ( 1 : 500 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , LAP isoform ( 1 : 500 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and LIP isoform ( 1 : 500 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) overnight at 4 ℃ . The ap - propriate HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Wan - leibio , China ) were used to amplify the signals of primary antibodies . Then the ECL western blotting detection re - agent ( Wanleibio , China ) was used to display the content of protein and quantified by Image J Software . Enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) The levels of inflammatory mediators were quantified using specific ELISA kits for each group ( Control , Mock , Vector and Lenti - shC / EBP β group ) according to the manufacturers’ protocols ( tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - a ) , interleukin - 1 β ( IL - 1 β ) , interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) , from Merck Millipore , MA , USA ) . Statistical Analysis All data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation . Statistical comparisons were performed using one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparison ( Graphpad Prism , version 5 . 0 ) . P values of less than 0 . 05 were con - sidered statistically significant . Results In vitro : Lenti - viral shRNA approaches are sufficient to signifi - cantly reduce C / EBP β mRNA and protein expression in CMF To investigate the role of C / EBP β in CF differen - tiation , we used a lentivirus harboring C / EBP β shRNA ( Lenti - shC / EBP β ) . Quantitative RNA analysis of TGF - β 1 treated CF that were infected with Lenti - shC / EBP β re - sulted in significant reductions in C / EBP β mRNA , cofilin mRNA , and FLNA mRNA levels compared to the control ( control , mock and vector ) groups ( Figure 2 ) . Protein blot analyses of CMF infected with Lenti - shC / EBP β also dem - onstrated significant decreases in C / EBP β - ( LAP + LIP ) , C / EBP β - LAP , and C / EBP β - LIP protein expression ( Figure 3 ) . C / EBP β knockdown could attenuate cytoskeletal remodel - ing in CMF To determine the role of C / EBP β on cy - toskeletal switching and remodeling in CMF , CMF were infected with Lenti - shC / EBP β . We observed that C / EBP β knockdown significantly attenuated cofilin and FLNA mRNA expression in CMF when compared with controls ( not infected with Lenti - shC / EBP β ) ( Figure 4 ) . Thus , knockdown of C / EBP β can attenuate actin cytoskeletal re - modeling in CMF in vitro . C / EBP β knockdown could reduce inflammatory markers As shown in Table II , there was a marked increase in the Int Heart J November 2018 1392 Li , ET AL F igure 2 .

Administration of Lenti - C / EBP β re - duced the above - mentioned inflammatory mediators ( Table II ) . In vivo : C / EBP β knockdown attenuated cardiac inflammation and fibrosis in EAM rats To determine the role of C / EBP β on cardiac remodeling in a rat model of EAM , rats were in - jected with Lenti - shC / EBP β in vivo and histopathological analyses were performed ( Figure 5 ) . C / EBP β knockdown attenuated fibrotic markers in EAM rat hearts We performed immunohistochemical assessment of collagen I , collagen III , MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , α - SMA , and C / EBP β in rat heart tissues . We observed that collagen I , collagen III , MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , α - SMA , and C / EBP β pro - tein expressions are increased in heart tissue sections from EAM rats ( EAM group and EAM + Lentiviral Vector group ) , when compared to the Control group ( Figure 6 ) . Furthermore , C / EBP β knockdown attenuated the C / EBP β protein expression as well as expression of collagen I , col - lagen III , MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , and α - SMA in heart tissue sections from rats in the EAM + Lenti - shC / EBP β group ( Figure 6 ) . These results indicate that C / EBP β knockdown is capable of dampening inflammation mediated induction of α - SMA and collagen production , suggesting that C / EBP β is critical in myofibroblast differentiation . C / EBP β knockdown improved cardiac dimensions and function in EAM rats To determine the role of C / EBP β on heart structure and function in the rat EAM model , we performed echocardiography on rats in the Control , EAM , EAM + Lentiviral Vector , and EAM + Lenti - shC / EBP β groups . We observed cardiac hypertrophy , wall thinning , and cardiac dysfunction in rats in the EAM and EAM + Lentiviral Vector groups . However , C / EBP β knockdown could significantly improve cardiac dimensions and func - tion in rats in the EAM + Lenti - shC / EBP β group ( Table III ) . Discussion Myocarditis is a pivotal cause of sudden death among young adults . 26 ) It is also often the vaunt - courier of cardiac remodeling and heart failure . The rat EAM model is one that recapitulates immuno - inflammatory cardiac re - modeling ( fibrosis ) . 27 ) Myocardial fibrosis plays a principal role in the pathophysiology of heart failure ; however , the mechanisms driving inflammation - mediated cardiac fibro - sis remain unclear . C / EBP β is an important regulator of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses , but recent evidence also suggests that its loss can attenu - ate fibrosis in the lung and liver , 17 , 18 ) highlighting its po - Int Heart J November 2018 1393 THE ROLE OF C / EBP β IN CARDIAC FIBROSIS F igure 4 .

TGF - β 1 is a potent driver of myofibroblast differen - tiation from various progenitor cells , primarily resident fi - broblasts . The findings of this study suggest that TGF - β 1 mediated myofibroblast differentiation is sensitive to changes of C / EBP β knockdown as shown by the reduc - tion of actin regulatory protein expression . Cofilin and FLNA are newly discovered members of the actin regula - tory protein family . 27 , 28 ) FLNA binds to F - actin and in - duces high - angle crosslinking to provide a strong 3 - dimensional cytoskeletal structure . 29 - 31 ) Studies have de - scribed the importance of actin polymerization / depolym - erization as key mediators of CMF phenotype transforma - tion . 32 , 33 ) Specifically , polymerization / depolymerization of α - SMA is controlled by the actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin family , which binds polymerized actin ( F - actin ) and breaks it down into G - actin by depolymeriza - tion , thereby regulating the stability and function of α - SMA . 34 ) We found that C / EBP β knockdown could reduce the protein expression of cofilin and FLNA , suggesting that the cofilin / FLNA signaling pathway may be a down - stream effector of C / EBP β during CF differentiation . C / EBP β is an intronless gene that codes for the pro - duction of a single mRNA . The C / EBP β mRNA transcript can translate into 4 different protein isoforms : full length C / EBP β or LAP * ( liver - enriched transcriptional activating protein star ) with an atomic mass of 38 kDa , LAP ( liver - enriched transcriptional activating protein ) , which has an atomic mass of 35 kDa , the 20 kDa isoform LIP ( liver - enriched transcriptional inhibitory protein ) , and a smaller 16 kDa isoform . The isoform LAP is a transcriptional ac - tivator , while the isoform LIP , which lacks the transactiva - tion domain , is a transcriptional inhibitor . 35 ) C / EBP β mRNA can be translated into two isoforms , which include LAP ( LAP * ) and LIP . LIP lacks the activation domain and is thus thought to be the dominant negative isoform of LAP . 36 ) The ratio of LAP / LIP was considered as an in - Int Heart J November 2018 1395 THE ROLE OF C / EBP β IN CARDIAC FIBROSIS F igure 6 .

Our studies demonstrated an increase in the LAP / LIP ratio in C / EBP β knockdown studies . It is possible that although both LAP and LIP iso - forms were targeted by the C / EBP β shRNA lentivirus ; that LIP may be more impacted than LAP . The C / EBP β lentivirus inhibits LAP as well as LIP . These two come from the same mRNA . However , because the molecular activity of LIP is much higher than LAP , the degree of in - hibition of LIP would be more significant than that of LAP . Therefore , sh - C / EBP β impacts LIP more than LAP . 37 ) Some studies have demonstrated that increasing LIP isoform expression may have the capacity to control LAP activity , resulting in a decrease in the LAP / LIP ratio , and decreased α - SMA expression . 38 ) Recently , it has been found that the regulation of a - SMA expression and polymerization is the key to the phe - notypic transformation from fibroblasts into myofibro - blasts . 10 ) These processes are regulated by serum response factor ( SRF ) . The actin gene regulatory region of a - SMA contains the CArG box element . 39 , 40 ) SRF regulates a - SMA through this regulatory element . 41 ) In unpublished results , we found the pretreatment of CF with the SRF blocker CCG - 1423 could significantly inhibit C / EBP β induced CF differentiation . This suggested that SRF may be involved in C / EBP β induced CF transformation . The SRF gene regulatory region contains CCAAT binding element , which specifically binds to C / EBP β and regulates the ex - pression of target gene . 42 ) SRF is a weak transcriptional activator , which plays a role in the regulation of gene ex - pression . It can promote the transcription factor to form Int Heart J November 2018 1396 Li , ET AL the complex , and thus initiate transcription of the target gene . 43 ) The dependence on transcription factors is the ba - sic action model of SRF . We speculate that transcription factor complex C / EBP β - SRF plays an important role in differentiation from CF into CMF . However , further study is needed to verify the possible interactions between C / EBP β and SRF protein , and the effects of this interaction on the expression of a - SMA and its polymerization and depolymerization . Cardiac fibroblasts play a crucial role in extracellular matrix regulation as they produce structural proteins that comprise the extracellular matrix , such as collagen , as well as promote their degradation by secreting MMP pro - teins . We provide evidence that C / EBP β knockdown in a rat EAM model significantly attenuated cardiac collagen I , collagen III , MMP - 2 , and MMP - 9 protein levels . C / EBP β knockdown also impacted the fibroblasts inflammatory re - sponse as indicated by IL - 1 β , IL - 6 , and TNF - a produc - tion . It is well established that members of the C / EBP family regulate target genes associated with inflammation , including many cytokines and chemokines . 17 , 39 , 40 ) Our stud - ies also demonstrate that C / EBP β knockdown resulted in a cardiac structural and functional improvement in the rat EAM model . Previous studies have indicated that C / EBP β heterozygous deficient mice displayed improved cardiac function in the face of pressure overload , 41 ) which is con - sistent with our study findings . Taken together , our findings show that C / EBP β is a positive regulator of cardiac inflammation and fibrosis in EAM rats . We have demonstrated that C / EBP β regulates the actin remodeling proteins cofilin and FLNA in vitro , which are impacted during CMF differentiation . These findings may impact our in vivo findings utilizing C / EBP β shRNA lentiviral approaches in the rat EAM model , which demonstrate a role for C / EBP β in extracellular ma - trix production and degradation . Thus , the cofilin and FLNA - related signaling pathways may provide a potential new therapeutic target to attenuate cardiac fibrosis . How - ever , additional future studies are warranted to investigate the detailed mechanisms by which C / EBP β attenuates car - diac fibrosis . Disclosures Conflicts of interest : None .
