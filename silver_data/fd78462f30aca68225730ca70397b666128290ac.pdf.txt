Cheney 1 , * 1 Department of Cell and Molecular Physiology School of Medicine University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Chapel Hill , NC 27599 USA Summary Although many proteins , receptors , and viruses are trans - ported rearward along ﬁlopodia by retrograde actin ﬂow [ 1 – 3 ] , it is less clear how molecules move forward in ﬁlopo - dia . Myosin - X ( Myo10 ) is an actin - based motor hypothesized to use its motor activity to move forward along actin ﬁla - ments to the tips of ﬁlopodia [ 4 ] . Here we use a sensitive total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy system to directly visualize the movements of GFP - Myo10 . This reveals a novel form of motility at or near the single - molecule level in living cells wherein extremely faint particles of Myo10 move in a rapid and directed fashion toward the ﬁlopodial tip . These fast forward movements occur at w 600 nm / s over distances of up to w 10 m m and require Myo10 motor activity and actin ﬁlaments . As expected for imaging at the single - molecule level , the faint particles of GFP - Myo10 are diffraction limited , have an intensity range similar to single GFP molecules , and exhibit stepwise bleach - ing . Faint particles of GFP - Myo5a can also move toward the ﬁlopodial tip , but at a slower characteristic velocity of w 250 nm / s . Similar movements were not detected with GFP - Myo1a , indicatingthat notall myosins are capable of intraﬁlo - podial motility . These data indicate the existence of a novel system of long - range transport based on the rapid movement of myosin molecules along ﬁlopodial actin ﬁlaments . Results and Discussion Filopodia are slender actin - based extensions thought to func - tion as cellular sensors in processes such as nerve growth and blood vessel development . Filopodia have a relatively simple structure consisting of a bundle of parallel actin ﬁlaments sur - rounded by the plasma membrane [ 5 , 6 ] . Each actin ﬁlament has its barbed end oriented toward the tip of the ﬁlopodium , and actin monomers are constantly added to the ﬁlament at its barbed end . The actin in ﬁlopodia typically moves rearward at rates of 10 – 100 nm / s in a process known as retrograde ﬂow . Although retrograde ﬂow [ 7 ] is now known to be powered by a combination of actin polymerization and myosin - II - mediated contraction [ 8 ] , the mechanisms by which molecules move forward in ﬁlopodia are much less clear . Microtubules and membranous vesicles are generally absent from ﬁlopodia , so forward movement in ﬁlopodia is likely to depend either on diffusion or on an actin - based mechanism . Myo10 is an actin - based motor protein that localizes to the tips of ﬁlopodia and has potent ﬁlopodia - inducing activity [ 9 , 10 ] . The Myo10 heavy chain consists of a myosin head domain responsible for force production , a neck domain that provides binding sites for calmodulin or calmodulin - like light chains [ 11 ] , and a large tail [ 9 ] . The tail includes a segment that was initially predicted to form a coiled coil [ 12 ] , although the oligomerization status of Myo10 is currently unclear [ 13 , 14 ] . The remainder of the tail has been reported to bind to PIP 3 [ 15 ] , microtubules [ 16 ] , and b - integrins [ 17 ] . Imaging with conventional epiﬂuorescence revealed that the bright puncta of GFP - Myo10 normally present at the tips of ﬁlopodia sometimes move slowly rearward at 10 – 20 nm / s [ 4 ] , the rate of retrograde actin ﬂow in HeLa ﬁlopodia . Bright puncta also occasionally moved forward at w 80 nm / s , leading to the hypothesis that Myo10 moves forward by using its barbed - end motor activity to transport itself along ﬁlopodial actin ﬁla - ments . Consistent with this , a Myo10 construct comprised only of the head , neck , and predicted coiled coil ( Myo10 - HMM ) was sufﬁcient for tip localization [ 4 ] . Kinetic analyses of Myo10 head - neck constructs indicate that they have duty ratios intermediate between those of highly processive motors , such as Myo5a , and nonprocessive motors , such as muscle myosin [ 18 , 19 ] . Most importantly , recent single - molecule experiments with in vitro motility assays show that a HMM - like Myo10 forced dimer can move rapidly and proces - sively on artiﬁcial actin bundles at 340 – 780 nm / s [ 20 ] . To test whether living cells exhibit robust but previously unsuspected forms of trafﬁcking at the single - molecule level , here we use TIRF microscopy to image the movements of GFP - tagged motor proteins in ﬁlopodia . TIRF provides high sensitivity whereas the linear organization and deﬁned polarity of ﬁlopodia greatly facilitates particle tracking and analysis . In addition , the w 100 nm thickness of a ﬁlopodium means that all or most of a ﬁlopodium will be within the 100 – 200 nm penetra - tion distance of the TIRF ﬁeld . Imaging substrate - attached ﬁlopodia with TIRF thus provides a system that has much of the simplicity of an in vitro motility assay , but in the context of a living cell . TIRF Reveals a Novel Form of Rapid Motility in Filopodia To test the sensitivity of our TIRF system , we adsorbed low concentrations of pure GFP onto coverslips and imaged with TIRF . As expected for single - molecule imaging of GFP [ 21 ] , this resulted in the detection of faint spots that were diffraction limited , underwent stepwise bleaching , and exhibited ‘‘blink - ing’’ ( Movie S1 available online ) . When living HeLa cells were transiently transfected with full - length GFP - Myo10 and imaged by TIRF under the same conditions , bright labeling was observed at the tips of ﬁlopodia as well as at the ventral surface of the cell ( Movie S2 ) . Most importantly , close inspec - tion of individual ﬁlopodia revealed a novel form of motility in * Correspondence : cheneyr @ med . unc . edu 2 These authors contributed equally to this work 3 Present address : National Institutes of Health , NIDCD , Bethesda , MD 20892 , USA 4 Present address : Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology , Penn - sylvania State University , College of Medicine , Hershey , PA 17033 , USA which extremely faint particles of GFP - Myo10 moved rapidly toward the tip ( Movies S3 and S4 ) . The movements of the faint particles along a given ﬁlopo - dium are clearly illustrated in kymographs , which reveal numerous faint tracks corresponding to the rapid and directed movements of faint particles of GFP - Myo10 toward the tip ( Figure 1 ; Figure S1 ) . Approximately a dozen such tracks are visible in the 40 s time lapse illustrated in Figure 1B . Tracks from these fast forward movements appeared to have relatively constant intensities and most traveled the entire w 5 m m length of the ﬁlopodium . Although most particles moved in a smooth and apparently processive fashion until they reached the ﬁlopodial tip , particles occasionally paused or transiently reversed , generating Z - shaped tracks ( Figure 1D ; Figure S1 ) . Rapid forward movements of faint Myo10 particles were detected under a variety of TIRF imaging conditions , including the use of different camera settings , different magniﬁcations , and a different TIRF illuminator ( Figure S1 ) . At 25 (cid:2) C , the faint particles of Myo10 moved forward at an average velocity of 578 6 174 nm / s ( Figure 1E ) . At 37 (cid:2) C , the particles moved faster ( 840 6 210 nm / s ) , as expected for a motor - driven biological process . The velocities of GFP - Myo10 particles detected here in living cells are quite similar to the 340 – 780 nm / s reported for movements of individual molecules of a Myo10 forced - dimer on artiﬁcial actin bundles [ 20 ] . The forward movements detected here by TIRF are clearly distinct from the relatively infrequent forward move - ments of bright GFP - Myo10 puncta detected previously by conventional ﬂuorescence in that the particles detected here are much fainter , move 5 - to 10 - fold faster , and move forward much more frequently . In addition to the fast forward movements of faint particles of Myo10 , we also detected slow rearward movements ( Figure 1C ; Figure S1 ) . The average rate of the rearward move - ments was 23 6 8 nm / s ( 137 measurements from 20 ﬁlopodia ) , a velocity consistent with the hypothesis that GFP - Myo10 moves rearward by binding to actin ﬁlaments undergoing retrograde ﬂow . The bright puncta of GFP - Myo10 at the tips of ﬁlopodia were generally stationary and thus generated bright vertical tracks that became gradually dimmer because of photobleaching . Vertical tracks were also sometimes present at different points along a ﬁlopodium , indicating that some Myo10 molecules within the ﬁlopodial shaft are stationary , perhaps because of association with integrin - based adhesions [ 17 ] . It should be noted that we observed obvious movement of Myo10 particles in slender extensions that extended forward during imaging and that would thus be functionally deﬁned as ﬁlopodia ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . We also observed similar move - mentsinslenderextensionsthathadthebranchedmorphology A B C D E Figure 1 .

Because Myo10 particles ex - hibited the same kinds of motility in both forms of slender extension and both forms of extension contained ﬁlopodial markers such as F - actin and the actin bundling protein , fascin ( Figure S2 ) , we follow the convention in Svitkina et al . and refer to these slender extensions collectively as ﬁlopodia [ 22 ] . Faint Myo10 Particles Have Single - Molecule Characteristics We next investigated whether the faint particles detected by TIRF exhibited properties expected of single molecules [ 15 , 21 ] . High - magniﬁcation views show that the faint particles moving within ﬁlopodia are approximately the size expected for a diffraction - limited spot ( w 0 . 2 m m at half maximum inten - sity ) , whereas the bright puncta at ﬁlopodial tips are generally much larger ( Figure 2 ) . Manual measurements indicated that the faint particles had integrated intensities of w 100 arbitrary units ( AU ) , which is approximately 1 / 10 th to 1 / 100 th the inten - sity of a typical tip punctum . To facilitate particle tracking and quantiﬁcation , we wrote a program called Kymotracker , which utilizes the position and time coordinates from a line on a kymograph to semiautomatically track a particle and measure its intensity through time . As can be seen from the Kymotracker images of a faint particle of GFP - Myo10 as it moves along a ﬁlopodium , the faint particles appear diffraction limited and exhibit relatively constant intensities as they move ( Figure 2B ) . In some cases , a particle that had been tracked through several frames disappeared suddenly , as would be expected for photobleaching of a single GFP . With Kymo - tracker , the average intensity of the faint particles of GFP - Myo10 in ﬁlopodia was found to be 137 6 53 AU . The intensi - ties of single GFP molecules adsorbed to coverslips and imaged under the same illumination and exposure conditions had a similar magnitude and an overlapping distribution ( 78 6 35 AU ) ( Figures 2D and 2E ) , although it should be noted that the pure GFP was imaged in TBS rather than cytoplasm . Plots of intensity versus time revealed apparent stepwise bleaching events both for pure GFP on coverslips and for the faint particles moving within ﬁlopodia ( Figures 2F – 2I ) . Together these experiments demonstrate that the TIRF system used here can detect single molecules of pure GFP and that the faint particles of GFP - Myo10 detected in living cells correspond to single molecules or small oligomers . Particle Movements Require the Myo10 Motor and Actin To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the rapid movement of Myo10 , we utilized a panel of Myo10 deletion constructs . No rapid particle movements and no tip localiza - tion were detected in HeLa cells transfected with GFP - Myo10 - headless , a naturally occurring form of Myo10 that lacks most of the motor domain and thus lacks motor activity [ 9 ] ( Figure 3A ) . In addition , no tracks representing fast forward movement were detected with a full - length Myo10 construct containing a point mutation in its motor domain that corre - sponds to a weak actin - binding mutation in other myosins [ 23 ] ( GFP - Myo10 - E456K ; Figure S3 ) . GFP - Myo10 - HMM , which consists of the Myo10 motor , neck , and predicted coiled coil , did undergo rapid particle movements similar to those of full - length Myo10 ( Figure 3B ) . This suggests that a dimerized Myo10 head - neck domain is sufﬁcient for fast forward move - ments . Because systematic analysis of deletion constructs indicated that a forced - dimer construct consisting of the Myo10 head , neck , and ﬁrst 34 amino acids of the ‘‘coiled coil’’ fused to a GCN4 dimerization domain was the minimal construct able to clearly localize to ﬁlopodial tips , we imaged the forced dimer by TIRF and found that it was also capable of fast forward movements in ﬁlopodia ( Figure S3 ) . Together these experiments indicate that rapid movements of faint particles in ﬁlopodia require Myo10 motor activity and that dimerization of the head - neck region is sufﬁcient for fast forward movement and tip localization . To test whether the fast forward movements are dependent on actin , cells were treated with 1 m M latrunculin B to depoly - merize actin ﬁlaments . As expected , this triggered the collapse of ﬁlopodia that were not attached to the substrate ( not shown ) . Although latrunculin did not induce collapse of most substrate - attached ﬁlopodia , it did cause the loss or spreading of the bright puncta of GFP - Myo10 normally present at their tips ( Figure 3C ) . Most importantly , fast forward movements of GFP - Myo10 were not detected after treatment with latrun - culin B , indicating that the fast forward movements are indeed dependent on F - actin . Treatment of cells with 5 m M nocoda - zole did not block fast forward movements of GFP - Myo10 ( data not shown ) . A C B Figure 3 .

( C ) Kymograph showing that fast forward movements of GFP - Myo10 are blocked by latrunculin B . Cells were treated with 1 m M latrunculin B for w 10 min to depolymerize actin ﬁlaments and the remaining , substrate - attached ﬁlopodia were imaged by TIRF . Current Biology Vol 19 No 11 970 Faint Particles of GFP - Myo5a Undergo Similar Movements To test whether other myosins were capable of similar move - ments within ﬁlopodia , we imaged HeLa cells transfected with GFP - Myo1a ( brush border myosin I ) , a monomeric myosin that is nonprocessive and localizes to microvilli [ 24 ] . TIRF showed that GFP - Myo1a yielded a diffuse localization along the ﬁlopodia with no obvious enrichment at the ﬁlopodial tip ( Figure 4A ) . Importantly , GFP - Myo1a did not undergo detect - able fast forward movements in ﬁlopodia , indicating that not all myosins are capable of rapid directed movements in ﬁlopo - dia . We also tested GFP - Myo5a [ 25 ] , an intensively studied dimeric myosin that is processive and functions in organelle transport [ 26 ] and ﬁlopodial dynamics [ 27 ] . Interestingly , GFP - Myo5a was enriched at the tips of ﬁlopodia , and faint particles of GFP - Myo5a generated clear tracks corresponding to rapid forward movement ( Figure 4B ) . However , the GFP - Myo5a particles moved at only w 251 6 121 nm / s ( 59 measure - ments from 22 ﬁlopodia ) , signiﬁcantly ( p = 0 . 035 ) slower than the w 578 nm / s observed for GFP - Myo10 . The velocity of the GFP - Myo5a particles is very similar to the 270 – 330 nm / s reported for individual molecules of a dimeric Myo5a construct moving on actin bundles in vitro [ 20 ] . It is therefore likely that the rapid and directed movements of GFP - Myo5a detected here correspond to the visualization of individual Myo5a mole - cules moving along the actin ﬁlaments of living cells . As with GFP - Myo10 , faint particles of GFP - Myo5a sometimes moved slowly rearward at the retrograde ﬂow rate of w 10 – 20 nm / s ( Figure 4B ) . This observation provides direct evidence that Myo5a can indeed undergo retrograde ﬂow , as recently hypothesized [ 28 ] . Conclusions The TIRF experiments reported here reveal a novel form of long - range motility driven by myosin motors at or near the single - molecule level . The fast movements require Myo10 motor activity and actin ﬁlaments , but not the Myo10 tail . Together , these results strongly support the hypothesis that Myo10 molecules use their barbed - end motor activity to move forward along ﬁlopodial actin ﬁlaments ( see model illustrated in Movie S5 ) . The faint particles detected with A B C D Figure 4 . Faint Particles of GFP - Myo5a and GFP - VASP also Move Forward in the Filopodia of Living Cells ( A ) Kymographs from TIRF imaging of GFP - Myo1a in ﬁlopodia .

Note thatGFP - VASPlocalizes to ﬁlopodial tips and generates faint tracks corresponding to rapid forward movement . For GFP - Myo1a and GFP - Myo5a data , frames were acquired at w 2 . 3 frames per second , whereas the VASP data was acquired at w 1 . 6 frames per second . This resulted in fewer acquired frames and thus shorter kymographs for the VASP data , despite identical 76 s durations .

A Novel Form of Motility in Filopodia 971 TIRF exhibit a size , intensity range , and bleaching behavior consistent with imaging at the single - molecule level . It is not yet clear , however , whether these particles correspond to monomers , dimers , or small oligomers of Myo10 . Several factors contribute to this uncertainty , including the relatively high and variable background ﬂuorescence present in living cells , variable levels of protein expression , the nonideal behavior of GFP as a ﬂuorophore , and variations in the Z - axis position of the ﬁlopodium or molecules within it . It should also be noted that although we can clearly detect the movements of some particles , we cannot guarantee unambig - uous detection of every GFP - Myo10 molecule in a ﬁlopodium . Despite these limits , the combination of TIRF and GFP tagging used here provides a powerful strategy for imaging the move - ments of motor proteins and their cargos at or near the single - molecule level in living cells . In addition to exhibiting a novel form of rapid , long - range motility in ﬁlopodia , Myo10 also has potent ﬁlopodia - promoting activity . Our previous work indicates that Myo10’s ability to induce numerous ﬁlopodia requires ( 1 ) elements within the Myo10 tail and ( 2 ) the ability to localize to ﬁlopodial tips [ 10 ] . We now ﬁnd that only Myo10 constructs capable of moving rapidly forward in ﬁlopodia are able to localize to ﬁlopodial tips , so the novel form of motility reported here is likely to underlie both tip localization and ﬁlopodia promotion . Although the precise mechanism ( s ) by which Myo10 promotes ﬁlopodia are not yet clear , it could act by initiating ﬁlopodia , by transporting cargos that facilitate ﬁlopodia formation , by functioning as part of a mobile tip complex , or by some combi - nation of these or other mechanisms [ 9 , 10 , 14 ] . As a motor that moves rapidly along ﬁlopodia , Myo10 clearly transports itself to the ﬁlopodial tip , but it may also be respon - sible for the transport of other speciﬁc molecular cargos , such as VASP [ 29 ] . Indeed , preliminary experiments indicate that faint particles of GFP - VASP exhibit fast forward movements in ﬁlopodia very similar to those of Myo10 ( Figures 4C and 4D ) . A major goal for the future will be to test for cotransport at the single - molecule level and to determine whether Myo10 is required for transport of this and other cargos . It will also be interesting to determine whether Myo3a or Myo15a , myosins that localize to the tips of stereocilia and are neces - sary for hearing , undergo similar forms of movement [ 28 , 30 , 31 ] . In addition to revealing a novel form of motility , this work also suggests that motor proteins may power many as yet undetected movements at the single - molecule level .
