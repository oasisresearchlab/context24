OPEN ORIGINAL ARTICLE Oncogenic signaling by Kit tyrosine kinase occurs selectively on the Golgi apparatus in gastrointestinal stromal tumors Y Obata 1 , K Horikawa 1 , T Takahashi 2 , Y Akieda 1 , M Tsujimoto 3 , JA Fletcher 4 , H Esumi 5 , T Nishida 6 , 7 and R Abe 1 Gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GISTs ) are caused by gain - of - function mutations in the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase . Most primary GIST patients respond to the Kit inhibitor imatinib , but this drug often becomes ineffective because of secondary mutations in the Kit kinase domain . The characteristic intracellular accumulation of imatinib - sensitive and - resistant Kit protein is well documented , but its relationship to oncogenic signaling remains unknown . Here , we show that in cancer tissue from primary GIST patients as well as in cell lines , mutant Kit accumulates on the Golgi apparatus , whereas normal Kit localizes to the plasma membrane ( PM ) . In imatinib - resistant GIST with a secondary Kit mutation , Kit localizes predominantly on the Golgi apparatus . Both imatinib - sensitive and imatinib - resistant Kit ( Kit ( mut ) ) become fully auto - phosphorylated only on the Golgi and only if in a complex - glycosylated form . Kit ( mut ) accumulates on the Golgi during the early secretory pathway , but not after endocytosis . The aberrant kinase activity of Kit ( mut ) prevents its export from the Golgi to the PM . Furthermore , Kit ( mut ) on the Golgi signals and activates the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase – Akt ( PI3K – Akt ) pathway , signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 ( STAT5 ) , and the Mek – Erk pathway . Blocking the biosynthetic transport of Kit ( mut ) to the Golgi from the endoplasmic reticulum inhibits oncogenic signaling . PM localization of Kit ( mut ) is not required for its signaling . Activation of Src - family tyrosine kinases on the Golgi is essential for oncogenic Kit signaling . These results suggest that the Golgi apparatus serves as a platform for oncogenic Kit signaling .

Mutant Kit ( Kit ( mut ) ) transforms a precursor of ICC through permanent activation of the PI3K – Akt pathway , STATs and Erk resulting in development of GIST . 15 – 21 GIST cells can then proliferate autonomously due to the anti - apoptotic effect and cell cycle progression by Kit signals . 17 – 21 PDGFR α ( mut ) also causes GIST ( ~ 5 % ) in this way . 22 , 23 Ten percent of GISTs have no mutation either in Kit or PDGFR α . 23 , 24 The drug imatinib , a selective inhibitor of Kit , improved the prognosis of GIST patients and the median overall survival is now estimated more than 5 years . 23 – 25 However , resistance to the drug appears with prolonged use and has become a serious problem . 23 , 24 Most imatinib - resistant cases have a secondary Kit mutation in the kinase domain , and then lose sensitivity to the drug . 24 , 26 , 27 Further understanding of oncogenic signals is required for establishment of effective targeting of therapy . The characteristic intracellular accumulation of Kit ( mut ) and PDGFR α ( mut ) in GIST patients is well documented , 28 – 33 but its relationship to oncogenic signaling remains unknown . We recently reported that in mastocytomas , Kit ( mut ) causes onco - genic signaling on intracellular compartments , such as endo / lysosomes . 34 We then explored how and where oncogenic Kit signals occur in GISTs . Here we show that in primary GIST patients and cell lines , mutant Kit accumulates on the Golgi apparatus in a manner that depends on its kinase activity . In imatinib - resistant GIST with a secondary Kit mutation , Kit localizes predominantly on the Golgi . Both imatinib - sensitive and imatinib - resistant Kit ( Kit ( mut ) ) become fully auto - phosphorylated only on the Golgi and only if in a complex - glycosylated form . Furthermore , Kit ( mut ) on the Golgi signals and activates the PI3K – Akt pathway , STAT5 , and the Mek – Erk pathway . Blocking Kit ’ s localization to the Golgi from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) inhibits oncogenic signaling . Plasma membrane ( PM ) localization of Kit ( mut ) is not required for its signaling .

Our study demonstrates that Kit ( mut ) ’ s pathogenicity is related to its mis - localization , and may offer a new strategy for treating imatinib - resistant GISTs . RESULTS In cancer tissue from GIST patients , Kit ( mut ) accumulates on the Golgi apparatus To investigate the sub - cellular localization of Kit , we performed confocal immuno ﬂ uorescence microscopic analyses of cancer tissue from GIST patients . In GIST expressing Kit ( mut ) , Kit accumulated at the perinuclear region ( Figure 1a ) . In contrast , in GIST with no Kit mutations or PDGFR α mutations , wild - type ( wt ) Kit localized preferentially at the PM ( Figure 1b ) . Moreover , PDGFR α ( mut ) localized to the perinuclear region instead of the PM ( Figure 1c ) , indicating that in GIST , type III RTKs with mutations mis - localize . Since the perinuclear region may connect to the Golgi apparatus , 28 – 33 , 35 we also stained with a Golgi marker GM130 to see if Kit and PDGFR α were located there . Kit ( mut ) and PDGFR α ( mut ) , but not Kit ( wt ) , co - localized precisely with GM130 ( Figures 1d – f ) . By calculating Pearson ’ s R correlation coef ﬁ cients ( Pearson ’ s R ) between GM130 and the receptors , we found that Kit ( mut ) and PDGFR α ( mut ) localized signi ﬁ cantly on the Golgi , Figure 1 . In cancer tissue from GIST patients , Kit ( mut ) accumulates on the Golgi apparatus . ( a – f ) Paraf ﬁ n - embedded tumor tissue specimens were immuno - stained with anti - Kit ( a , b , d and e ; blue ) , anti - PDGFR α ( c and f ; blue ) , anti - GM130 ( Golgi matrix protein 130 kDa ; green ) , and Höechst33342 ( DNA ; white ) .

Oncogenic Kit signaling occurs on the Golgi in GISTs Y Obata et al 3662 Oncogene ( 2017 ) 3661 – 3672 whereas Kit ( wt ) did not ( Figure 1g and Table 1 ) . Furthermore , in imatinib - resistant GISTs with a secondary Kit mutation , Kit also localized at the Golgi ( Figure 1g , Supplementary Figure S1b , and Table 1 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that the oncogenic signaling may occur on the Golgi apparatus . In GIST cell lines , Kit ( mut ) localizes preferentially on the Golgi apparatus Next , to examine more broadly the sub - cellular localization of Kit , we stained GIST - T1 , GIST882 and GIST - R8 cell lines , which endogenously express Kit ( mut ) . GIST - T1 heterozygously expresses a Kit exon11 mutant Kit ( Δ 560 – 578 ) , whereas GIST882 homozy - gously expresses Kit ( K642E ) ( Supplementary Figure S2a ) . 20 , 36 GIST - R8 was established from GIST - T1 by continuous imatinib treatment , and this endogenously expresses Kit ( Δ 560 – 578 / D820V ) that confers imatinib resistance 37 ( Supplementary Figure S2a , bottom ) . In these cell lines , Kit localized mainly to the perinuclear region but not the PM ( Figures 2a – c , arrowheads ) . A green ﬂ uorescent protein - tagged Kit ( wt ) ( Kit ( wt ) - GFP ) was seen predominantly at the PM in HeLa and GIST - T1 ( Supplementary Figure S2b ) , indicating that Kit ( mut ) distributes speci ﬁ cally to the perinuclear region in GIST cell lines . These results are consistent with those from tumor tissue ( Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1b ) . 28 – 30 Next , we stained for Kit in conjunction with golgin97 ( trans - Golgi marker ) , GM130 ( cis - Golgi marker ) , calnexin ( ER marker ) , LAMP1 ( endo / lysosome marker ) or LysoTracker ( lysosome marker ) . In GIST cells , Kit co - localized mainly with the Golgi markers ( Figure 2d and Supplementary Figures S2c – e ) . Furthermore , Kit ( mut ) more precisely localized to the trans - Golgi rather than to the cis - Golgi ( Figure 2e ) , indicating that in GIST , Kit ( mut ) accumulates on the trans - Golgi cisternae . In GIST cells , activation of Kit ( mut ) occurs mainly on the Golgi apparatus To examine the relationship between Golgi localization of Kit ( mut ) and its activity , we immuno - stained for phospho - tyrosine - 721 in the kinase domain ( pKit [ Tyr721 ] ) that indicates Kit ’ s activation . 7 – 9 Interestingly , pKit [ Tyr721 ] was found only in the perinuclear region in GIST - T1 , GIST882 and GIST - R8 ( Figure 3a , arrowheads ) . Furthermore , pKit [ Tyr721 ] distributed signi ﬁ cantly to the Golgi rather than other perinuclear compartments , such as lysosomes ( Figure 3b and Supplementary Figure S3a ) . Figure 3c shows that pKit [ Tyr721 ] co - localized with golgin97 ( trans - Golgi marker ) rather than with GM130 ( cis - Golgi marker ) , indicating that more activation occurs on trans - Golgi than on cis - Golgi . Also , tyrosine phosphorylation signals are concentrated in the Golgi ( Supplementary Figures S3b and c ) , indicating that Golgi apparatus serves as a platform for tyrosine phosphorylation signaling in GISTs . In GIST - T1 and HeLa cells transfected with a mastocytoma - type mutant Kit ( D814Y ) , 14 , 34 , 38 autophosphorylation of the mutant mainly occurs on the Golgi ( Supplementary Figure S3d ) . This indicates that in these cells , gain - of - function mutations of Kit cause its activation selectively on the Golgi apparatus . To test Kit ’ s glycosylation state , we treated Kit from GIST cells with endoglycosidase H , which digests immature high - mannose forms , but not mature complex - glycosylated forms . Most Kit was in a complex - glycosylated form ( Figure 3d and Supplementary Figure S3e ) . Kit shifted to a non - glycosylated form following the complete digestion of N - linked glycans by peptide - N - glycosidase F . Moreover , autophosphorylation of mature Kit was greater than that of immature Kit ( Figure 3e and Supplementary Figure S3f ) . Since mature glycosylated proteins only exist on the trans - Golgi , these results suggest that full activation of Kit ( mut ) occurs on the trans - Golgi , and that Kit must be in the complex - glycosylated form to become fully activated . Kit ( mut ) accumulates on the Golgi during the early secretory pathway but not after endocytosis in a manner that depends on its kinase activity Next , we examined whether Kit accumulated on the Golgi after the early secretory pathway or after endocytosis from the PM . Recently , we reported that endocytosis of Kit ( mut ) can be blocked by pitstop2 and ﬁ lipin , which inhibit clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis and non - clathrin endocytosis , respectively . 34 , 39 , 40 In GIST - T1 , endocytosis inhibition for 24 h did not affect either the Golgi localization of Kit or its phosphorylation ( Figure 4a ) , indicating that the major pathway is early secretion . In support of this , Kit ’ s activation on the Golgi was unaffected by 24 - h treatment with monensin , an inhibitor of Golgi export 34 , 41 ( Supplementary Figure S4 ; see also Figure 5b , left panels ) . These results indicate that Kit ( mut ) accumulated on the Golgi during the early secretory pathway , but not after endocytosis . We next examined the role of Kit ’ s activation in Kit ’ s localization . To test this , we treated a selective Kit inhibitor imatinib 25 , 42 ( Supplementary Figure S5a ) . In GIST - T1 treated with 200 n M imatinib for 4 h , Kit dispersed from the Golgi region signi ﬁ cantly ( Figure 4b ) . Immunostaining of cell surface showed that Kit moved to the PM ( Figure 4c ) . Imatinib , however , did not affect the localization of Kit in GIST - R8 , ( Supplementary Figures S5b and c ) . To block the activation of Kit ( mut ) in GIST - R8 , we treated with another Kit inhibitor PKC412 34 , 43 , 45 ( Supplementary Figure S5b ) . In GIST - R8 , PKC412 signi ﬁ cantly decreased the Golgi localization of Kit ( Supplementary Figure S5c ) . Taken together , these results suggest that what prevents Kit ’ s export from the Golgi is Kit ’ s kinase activity . In GIST , Kit ( mut ) on the Golgi activates the PI3K – Akt pathway , STAT5 and Erk Previous reports showed that Kit ( mut ) activates the PI3K – Akt pathway , STAT5 and the Mek – Erk pathway through phosphorylation 15 – 21 ( Supplementary Figures S6a – c ) , leading to autonomous proliferation of GIST cells . Thus , we examined whether Kit ( mut ) must localize to the Golgi to activate the PI3K – Akt pathway , STAT5 and Erk . To answer this we inhibited intracellular traf ﬁ cking . First , we treated GIST - T1 with brefeldin A ( BFA ) , an inhibitor of protein traf ﬁ cking from the ER to the Golgi . 34 , 46 After 16 - h treatment , partially glycosylated Kit co - localized with the ER marker calnexin , a sign of inhibition of traf ﬁ cking to the Golgi ( Figure 5a ) . Interestingly , pKit [ Tyr721 ] was greatly reduced in BFA - treated GIST - T1 , thus Kit could not activate the PI3K – Akt pathway , STAT5 , or Erk ( Figure 5a , right panels ; see also Figure 5e , left panels ) .

Oncogenic Kit signaling occurs on the Golgi in GISTs Y Obata et al 3663 Oncogene ( 2017 ) 3661 – 3672 Furthermore , we treated for 24 h with monensin , an inhibitor of protein export from the Golgi apparatus . 34 , 41 Kit ( mut ) remained phosphorylated and activated downstream molecules , but shifted to a slightly lower molecular weight form ( Figure 5b , right ; see also Supplementary Figure S4 ) . This form was endoglycosidase H - resistant ( Supplementary Figure S6d ) , indicating that most Kit reached the trans - Golgi cisternae . Since monensin inhibits Kit traf ﬁ cking from the Golgi to the PM ( Figure 5b , left images ) , PM localization of Kit is not required for oncogenic signaling , and Golgi - localization is suf ﬁ cient . We previously reported that ba ﬁ lomycin A1 ( BafA1 ) , an inhibitor of endo / lysosomal traf ﬁ cking , suppresses Akt activation by Kit ( mut ) in mastocytoma . 34 Thus , we examined the effect of inhibition of endo / lysosomal traf ﬁ cking on oncogenic Kit signaling in GISTs . As shown in Figure 5c , BafA1 increased Kit on vesicular structures , suggesting that some Kit traf ﬁ cs along the endo / Figure 2 .

Oncogenic Kit signaling occurs on the Golgi in GISTs Y Obata et al 3665 Oncogene ( 2017 ) 3661 – 3672 lysosomal pathway for degradation . Inhibition of endo / lysosomal traf ﬁ cking , however , does not affect oncogenic Kit signaling ( Figure 5c and Supplementary Figure S6e ) . These results are different from how Kit ( mut ) in mastocytoma activates Akt and STAT5 . Data from GIST882 and GIST - R8 treated with BFA or monensin strongly supported our idea that in GISTs , oncogenic Kit signals originate from the Golgi ( Figure 5d and Supplementary Figure S6f ) . In GIST882 and GIST - R8 , but not GIST - T1 , Kit ( mut ) in the ER became Tyr721 phosphorylated ( Figure 5d and Supplementary Figure S6f ) . Since phosphorylated Kit Tyr721 is critical for association with a PI3K p85 subunit , 4 , 8 , 9 we tested whether Kit bound to p85 in the ER . Co - immunoprecipitation experiments , following BFA treatment to block ER export , showed that in GIST882 and GIST - R8 , Kit still associated with p85 , but in GIST - T1 it did not ( Figure 5e and Supplementary Figure S6g ) . In all cases , downstream signaling was abolished . These results indicate that Kit ( mut ) in the ER is unable to activate Akt , even if Kit ( mut ) binds to PI3K . In these cell lines , monensin did not affect the Kit – PI3K association ( Figure 5e and Supplementary Figure S6g ) , supporting our ﬁ nding that Kit ( mut ) activates Akt signaling through PI3K on the Golgi apparatus . Supplementary Figure S6h shows that in GIST882 ’ s Golgi , Kit was phosphorylated not only on Tyr721 but also on Tyr568 / 570 and Tyr703 . 4 , 8 , 47 In the ER , Kit was dephosphorylated on Tyr568 - / 570 and Tyr703 markedly , although Tyr721 was dephosphory - lated partially ( Supplementary Figure S6i ; compare with Figure 5d ) . This con ﬁ rms that full activation of Kit ( mut ) occurs only after it reaches the Golgi apparatus . In addition , these results suggest that different tyrosines get phosphorylated in different organelles . Swainsonine inhibits α - mannosidase II at the medial - Golgi , altering protein glycosylation . 48 In swainsonine - treated cells , Kit was shifted to a slightly lower molecular weight , con ﬁ rming altered glycosylation ( Supplementary Figure S7a , top panels ) . The treatment did not however affect Kit ’ s localization and the activation of Akt , STAT5 and Erk ( Supplementary Figures S7a and b ) . These results indicate that oncogenic Kit signaling on the Golgi is independent of glycosylation state . Activation of Src - family tyrosine kinases on the Golgi is essential for oncogenic Kit signaling Previous studies showed that SFKs , such as Src , Yes , Lyn and Fyn localize to the Golgi through lipid modi ﬁ cation , where they can initiate mitogenic signals . 49 , 50 Thus , we examined whether SFKs were involved in oncogenic Kit signaling . As shown in Supplementary Figure S8a , GIST - T1 , GIST882 and GIST - R8 expressed Src and Yes . Although Src and Yes were undetectable by our immuno ﬂ uorescence assay , anti - SFKs and anti - phosphorylated SFKs ( anti - pSFKs ) could visualize their intracellular location . SFKs predominantly localized to the trans - Golgi cisternae ( Figures 6a and b and Supplementary Figure S8b ) . In addition , pSFKs localized to the trans - Golgi cisternae , where Kit ( mut ) accumulated ( Figures 6c and d , and Supplementary Figure S8b ) , indicating that SFKs on the Golgi might participate in oncogenic Kit signaling . Next , we investigated the effect of the inhibition of SFKs on Kit signaling . We con ﬁ rmed that PP2 inhibited the autophosphoryla - tion of Src and Yes ( Figure 6e and Supplementary Figure S8c ) . SFK inhibition decreased the activation of Akt , STAT5 and Erk without affecting pKit [ Tyr721 ] or pKit [ Tyr703 ] ( Figures 6f and g , and Supplementary Figure S8d ) . As shown in Figure 6h , the inhibition of SFKs decreased pKit [ Tyr568 / 570 ] . In addition to PP2 , the unrelated SFK inhibitor SU6656 50 gave similar results ( Supple - mentary Figure S8e and f ) . Our co - immunoprecipitation assays , however , showed that Src and Yes did not bind Kit ( mut ) ( Figure 6i and Supplementary Figure S8g ) . These results suggest that SFKs have a role in the full functioning of Kit ( mut ) without any direct physical interaction . Also , BFA ( a Golgi disruptor ) and imatinib ( a Kit inhibitor ) did not affect the activation of SFKs ( Figures 6e and j , and Supplementary Figures S8c and h ) , indicating that the activation of SFKs is independent of Kit ( mut ) . In summary , Kit ( mut ) requires Golgi - localized SFK activity for oncogenic signaling ( Supplementary Figure S8i ) . These results are consistent with our hypothesis that in GIST , the Golgi apparatus serves as a platform for oncogenic signaling . Previous reports showed that SFKs regulate intra - Golgi transport . 50 Thus , we tested whether SFKs have a role in retention of Kit ( mut ) on the Golgi . As shown in Supplementary Figure S9a , SFK inhibition did not affect the localization of Kit to the Golgi . Taken together with fact that SFK inhibition suppressed the PI3K – Akt pathway , STAT5 and Erk , it appears that these activations are not essential for Kit ’ s retention on the Golgi . In support of this , LY294002 ( PI3K inhibition ) , Akt inhibitor and U0126 ( Erk inhibition ) had no effect on the localization of Kit to the Golgi ( Supplementary Figures S9a and b ) . At present , the mechanism of Kit ’ s retention on the Golgi is not understood fully . DISCUSSION In this study , we demonstrate that in GIST , Kit ( mut ) accumulates on the Golgi and that oncogenic Kit signaling occurs on the Golgi ( Figure 7 , left ) . Newly synthesized Kit ( mut ) traf ﬁ cs normally from the ER to the Golgi , then undergoes complex glycosylation as normal . After reacting the Golgi , Kit ( mut ) can activate the PI3K – Akt pathway , STAT5 and the Mek – Erk pathway . Activation of SFKs on the Golgi is needed for oncogenic Kit signaling . Activation of Kit in the wrong subcellular compartment then prevents its export from Golgi to the PM . These mechanisms are common between imatinib - sensitive and imatinib - resistant Kit ( mut ) . Aberrant accumulation of oncogenic receptors in the Golgi has been reported previously . FGFR3 ( K650E ) , a mutant found in multiple myelomas and skeletal dysplasia patients , is localized on the Golgi , then autophosphorylated , 51 , 52 and PDGFR α ( mut ) and Kit ( mut ) expressed in HEK293 or NIH3T3 localize to the Golgi region . 29 , 35 , 53 H - Ras and SFKs , which are downstream molecules of RTKs , can initiate mitogenic signaling from the Golgi apparatus . 49 , 50 , 54 , 55 However , there has been no direct evidence that the mutant receptors cause oncogenic signaling on the Golgi apparatus . Here , we show that mutant receptors mis - localize in solid tumor using a panel of cancer tissues from GIST patients , and that Kit ( mut ) must localize to the Golgi to cause oncogenic activation of the PI3K – Akt pathway , STAT5 and Erk . Our study demonstrates in GISTs the pathological signi ﬁ cance of the accumulation of mutant receptors in the Golgi for their signaling . Recently , we reported that in mast cells , Kit ( D814Y ) activates the PI3K – Akt pathway and STAT5 on endo / lysosomes and the ER , respectively 34 ( Figure 7 , right ) . In this study , Kit ( D814Y ) expressed in GIST cells , however , was autophosphorylated only on the Golgi apparatus . Namely , GIST and mastocytoma both show the same oncogenic Kit ( mut ) signaling mechanism , but the signaling platforms are different . These results are consistent with the idea that there may be different regulatory mechanisms of oncogenic signaling initiated from organelles where Kit is localized . In considering putative mechanisms , in GIST , Kit ( mut ) accumu - lated on the Golgi in a manner dependent only on its kinase activity , and independent of downstream activation . Inhibitors of downstream activation , such as Ly294002 and U0126 , do not block Kit ’ s phosphorylation and association with other proteins , suggesting that feature of the phosphorylated Kit ( mut ) complex , such as shape , size , and / or charge , is responsible for its retention in the Golgi apparatus . On the other hand , in mastocytoma , Kit ( mut ) can move from the Golgi normally . 34 Further analyses of differences of traf ﬁ cking machinery between mastocytoma and GIST may explain the Golgi retention of Kit ( mut ) . Oncogenic Kit signaling occurs on the Golgi in GISTs Y Obata et al 3666 Oncogene ( 2017 ) 3661 – 3672 Mutations in Kit ’ s juxta - membrane domain or tyrosine kinase domain 1 ( TKD1 ) are common in GISTs , 11 , 23 , 24 but rare in human neoplastic mast cell disorders . 14 Neoplastic mast cells commonly have a mutation elsewhere , in the activation loop of Kit ’ s tyrosine kinase domain 2 ( TKD2 ) . 14 GIST - type Kit may be insuf ﬁ cient for transforming mast cells . A previous study on Ba / F3 cells showed that the TKD1 mutant but not the juxta - membrane domain mutant can suppresses the expression of SH2 - containing inositol - 5 ' - phosphatase 1 ( SHIP1 ) 56 that inhibits the PI3K – Akt pathway , 57 suggesting that different Kit mutants use different signaling pathways . The TKD2 mutant may have novel functions , which GIST - type Kit does not have . TKD2 mutant may lead mast cells to autonomous proliferation , not only through SHIP1 suppression , but also through other signal pathways different to those seen in GIST . Forced expression of each mutant in mast cells and analyses of signaling will help us to understand the precise mechanism . Phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) , which is necessary for Akt activation , is believed to be generated only at the PM by Kit – PI3K . 3 , 4 , 9 This seems to be inconsistent with our observation that Kit activates Akt through PI3K on the Golgi . However , previous studies showed that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , a substrate of PI3K , exists on the Golgi , 58 – 60 supporting our hypothesis that Golgi - localized Kit – PI3K can activate Akt . On the other hand , in the ER , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is converted mainly to PI ( 4 ) P , 59 so ER - localized Kit – PI3K cannot activate Akt . Further studies will be required to understand the mechanism by which the Kit – PI3K complex activates Akt selectively on the Golgi apparatus . Tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) and antibodies have been widely used for blocking signaling from RTKs . 61 , 62 Our study implicates that mutant RTKs , such as Kit ( mut ) and PDGFR α ( mut ) , can escape from antibodies because the mutants are trapped inside cells . Since treatment with TKIs causes mutant RTKs to remain at the PM through inhibiting mislocalization of the mutants , 29 , 34 , 35 , 63 , 64 TKIs might also enhance the activity of antibody in blocking oncogenic signaling . From this point of view , combined therapy with TKIs and antibody seems attractive . Imatinib is ef ﬁ cacious in most patients with primary GISTs harboring Kit mutations . 23 – 25 However , two major problems arise in this targeting therapy . First , resistance to the drug appears with prolonged use . Most imatinib - resistant cases have a secondary Kit mutation in the kinase domain , and then lose sensitivity to the drug . 23 , 26 , 27 In other cancers with RTK ( mut ) , resistance to TKIs develops in a manner similar to imatinib - resistant Kit . 65 In this study , we showed that blockade of Kit traf ﬁ cking from the ER suppresses its oncogenic signaling . Importantly , its blockade could suppress oncogenic Kit signaling regardless of resistance to TKI drugs . These results suggest that blockade of traf ﬁ cking may be a new strategy for inhibition of TKI - resistant RTKs . A second concern with imatinib treatment is its side effects . A previous study reported that patients with a duplication in the Kit extracellular domain require a higher dosage of imatinib . 13 , 66 However , side effects such as nausea and anemia limit dosage . Recent studies showed that imatinib accumulates mainly in lysosomes but not in the Golgi . 67 , 68 Golgi - targeting of imatinib by chemical modi ﬁ ca - tions might improve therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy and reduce side effects . Since the cancer - causing mutants of EGF - R , Met , Flt3 and gp130 also initiate their signals from organelles , 64 , 69 – 73 intracellular delivery of TKIs to signaling platforms will open new ﬁ elds for targeting therapy . In conclusion , we show that oncogenic Kit signals from the Golgi are essential for the autonomous proliferation of GIST cells . These ﬁ ndings provide new insights not only into the pathogenic role of Kit ( mut ) but also into targeting therapy . Improper traf ﬁ cking and aberrant signaling are frequent features of mutant RTKs . Our ﬁ ndings shed light on the signi ﬁ cance of the spatial organization of this oncogenic signaling , and suggest strategies for the improvement of therapy . Figure 4 .

Model of oncogenic Kit signaling on intracellular compartments in GISTs and mast cell tumors . ( Left , GISTs ) Newly synthesized Kit ( mut ) traf ﬁ cs normally from the ER to the Golgi , then undergoes complex glycosylation as normal . After reacting the Golgi , Kit ( mut ) can activate the PI3K – Akt pathway , STAT5 and Erk . SFKs on the Golgi are needed for oncogenic Kit signaling . Activation of Kit in the wrong subcellular compartment , then prevents its export from Golgi to the PM . These mechanisms are common between imatinib - sensitive and imatinib - resistant Kit cases . ( Right , mast cell tumors ) Soon after synthesis , immature Kit is localized on the ER and activates STAT5 . It then traf ﬁ cs to the PM along the secretory pathway . After Kit ( mut ) reaches the PM , it imme - diately moves to endolysosomes through endocytosis in a kinase activity - dependent manner . Kit – PI3K activates Akt speci ﬁ cally on endolysosomes .
