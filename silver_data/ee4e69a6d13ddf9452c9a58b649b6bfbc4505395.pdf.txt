INTRODUCTION Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori ) is a gram - negative microaerophilic spiral bacterium that colonizes the stomach of approximately half of the world ' s population . Colonization of the stomach by H . pylori causes chronic gastritis that , during the decades that follow initial infection , can remain silent or evolve into more severe diseases , such as atrophic gastritis , peptic ulcer , lymphoma of the mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) or gastric adenocarcinoma ( 1 - 4 ) . The strong association between H . pylori infection and gastric cancer led the World Health Organization to classify H . pylori as a class 1 carcinogen ( 5 ) . Cancer risk is believed to be related to differences among H . pylori strains and inflammatory responses governed by host genetics ( 3 , 4 ) . In particular , specific interactions between host factors that modulate the response to the infection , and bacterial virulence factors that can directly cause tissue damage seem to have a major pathogenic role in the development of gastric cancer ( 3 , 4 ) . Among several virulence factors produced by the bacterium , a pivotal role in H . pylori pathogenetic action is played by the vacuolating toxin VacA ( reviewed in 3 , 6 , 7 ) . VacA is a protein toxin , formed by monomers of ~ 90 kDa , able to induce cytoplasmic vacuoles in eukaryotic cells in culture ( 6 , 7 - 9 ) . Cytoplasmic vacuoles are also present in vivo in the gastric epithelium of H . pylori - colonized patients ( 10 - 12 ) . When given to mice , purified VacA causes gastric epithelial damage closely resembling that found in H . pylori - colonized patients ( 13 ) . After cell internalization , VacA localizes in the endocytic - endosomal compartment from which vacuoles originate ( 14 - 16 ) . Vacuole development is strictly dependent on the presence in the incubation medium of weak bases like ammonia ( which can be generated by urease activity , a hallmark of H . pylori ) ( 15 , 17 ) . It has been reported that VacA may act as a channel - forming toxin and it has also been proposed that VacA channels play a direct role in cell vacuolation . Endocytosed VacA channels could stimulate the turnover of endosomal V - ATPase by increasing the permeability of the endosomal membrane to anions ( reviewed in 6 , 9 ) . This would lead to the accumulation of osmotically active species ( such as NH 4 + ) causing an osmotic imbalance of late endosomes with subsequent vacuole formation . However , despite about 20 years of research , it is yet unknown the role of VacA - induced vacuolation as well as the main function of VacAtoxin in the overall virulence of H . pylori . It has been indeed proposed that VacAacts as a multifunctional toxin that can have pleiotropic effects on mammalian cells and tissues modulating both several epithelial cell functions and immune cell functions ( 3 , 7 ) . Afew years ago , our group demonstrated that VacA ( both the whole molecule and its N - terminal moiety ) can reach mitochondria , leading to epithelial cell apoptosis through cytochrome c release ( 18 ) . In this respect , it is worth noting that one mechanism by which H . pylori increases the risk for carcinogenesis is by altering cell turnover and mounting evidence suggests that H . pylori is associated with an increased JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGYAND PHARMACOLOGY 2009 , 60 , 3 , 23 - 30 www . jpp . krakow . pl Original articles V .

RICCI 1 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VAC A TOXIN AND AMMONIA IN HELICOBACTER PYLORI - INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN HUMAN GASTRIC EPITHELIAL CELLS 1 Department of Physiology , Human Physiology Section , University of Pavia , Pavia , Italy ; 2 IGM - CNR , Department of Animal Biology , University of Pavia , Pavia , Italy ; 3 Department of Internal Medicine , Chair of Gastroenterology , Second University of Naples , Naples , Italy ; 4 Department of Clinical Bacteriology , Nice University Medical School , Nice , France VacAtoxin is one of the most important virulence factors produced by H . pylori even though neither its role nor its action mechanisms are completely understood . First considered as a toxin inducing only cell vacuolation , VacA causes apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells by targeting mitochondria . A hotly debated question about VacA action is its relationship with ammonia , which is produced in vivo by H . pylori urease . While ammonia is strictly required for VacA - dependent vacuolation , its role in VacA - induced apoptosis is much less defined . This study was thus aimed to investigate the relationship between VacA toxin and ammonia in H . pylori - induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis of human gastric epithelial cells in culture by means of flow cytometry . Our results show that , unlike cell vacuolation , in MKN 28 cells neither apoptosis nor dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential induced by VacA require ammonia . Nevertheless , ammonia significantly potentiates both these VacA - induced effects , but independently of the swelling of VacA - containing endosomes ( i . e . , vacuolation ) . Our findings make unlikely the hypothesis that ammonia - dependent swelling and rupture of endosomal vesicles in which VacA is sequestered after cell internalization may allow the toxin to reach mitochondria and trigger apoptosis . Key words : Helicobacter pylori , VacA toxin , apoptosis , gastric epithelial cells , gastric infection level of apoptosis in vivo ( 19 - 22 ) . Interestingly , Cover et al . ( 22 ) demonstrated that , in AGS gastric epithelial cells in culture , VacA - induced apoptosis was strictly dependent on the presence of ammonia ( at a concentration not apoptogenic by itself ) in the culture medium and thus closely associated with the development of VacA - induced vacuoles . This observation raised the hypothesis that the requirement of ammonia ( and thereby of vacuolation ) for VacA to elicit apoptosis might be due to the need for VacA to escape from endosomes for reaching the cytosol and then the mitochondria where it triggers cytochrome c release ( 6 ) . A simple mechanism for VacA release from an internal vesicular compartment would be indeed to induce swelling of the vesicles until they rupture . Nevertheless , Willhite et al . ( 23 ) suggested that cell vacuolation and mitochondrial damage were independent outcomes of VacA toxin activity , even though vacuolation temporally preceded cytochrome c release , both dependent on the formation of anion - selective membrane channels by the toxin at the endosomal or mitochondrial level , respectively . Recently , using AZ - 521 gastric cells in culture , Yamasaki et al . ( 24 ) suggested however that VacA induces epithelial cell apoptosis via the mitochondria - dependent pathway not directly acting on mitochondria but rather activating the proapoptotic Bcl - 2 family protein Bax . Ammonia would not be necessary for VacA - induced Bax activation and apoptosis , but would increase VacA action in a vacuolation - independent fashion ( 24 ) . This study was thus designed to further investigate the relationship between VacA toxin and ammonia in H . pylori - induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis of human gastric epithelial cells in culture by means of flow cytometry . MATERIAL AND METHODS H . pylori growth and VacA toxin purification VacA - producing ( s1a / m1 vacA genotype ) H . pylori strain 60190 ( ATCC 49503 ) was grown in Brucella broth ( Difco , Detroit , MI ) supplemented with 1 % Vitox ( Oxoid , Basingstoke , UK ) and 0 . 2 % β - cyclodextrins ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) for 36 - 48 h at 37°C under microaerobic conditions and continuous shaking . VacA was purified from broth culture supernatant by ammonium sulphate precipitation and gel filtration chromatography using a Superose 6 10 / 300 GL column ( Amersham Biosciences , Umea , Sweden ) in accordance with Cover et al . ( 25 ) and its concentration was determined using the DC protein assay kit ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) . Purified VacA was stored in melting ice and , immediately before use , was activated by dropwise acidification to pH 3 . 0 with 0 . 2 N HCl ( 25 , 26 ) . Human gastric epithelial cells in culture We used the MKN 28 cell line , derived from a human gastric tubular adenocarcinoma , which is known to retain gastric type differentiation ( 14 , 27 , 28 ) and to provide a suitable model for the study of the response of gastric epithelial cells to H . pylori ( 14 , 15 , 26 , 29 - 31 ) . MKN 28 cells were grown in DMEM / Ham ' s nutrient mixture F - 12 ( 1 : 1 ) ( Sigma ) supplemented with 10 % foetal calf serum ( FCS ; from Cambrex BioScience , Verviers , Belgium ) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 in air and used at 30 - 40 % confluency . Experimental design Cell monolayers were washed twice with Hanks ' s balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) and incubated at 37°C for different times ( ranging from 1 to 24 h ) with different doses ( ranging from 2 to 50 nM ) of activated purified VacA , diluted in HBSS in the absence or presence of 5 mM NH 4 Cl , or , in some experiments , of 0 . 1 mM chloroquine . Equivalent volumes of acid - treated buffer alone , diluted in HBSS in the absence or presence of 5 mM NH 4 Cl , were used as controls . At various time points , variously treated cell monolayers were then analyzed for cell apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential ( MTP ) by flow cytometry . In some experiments , cells were preincubated for 1 h with 30 nM bafilomycin A 1 ( BAFA1 , a specific inhibitor of the endosomal V - ATPase ) which was maintained during the subsequent incubation period with VacA or control . Morphologic appearance of variously treated cell monolayers in the absence or presence of BAFA1 was also evaluated using a phase - contrast inverted microscope ( Diaphot 300 ; Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) equipped with a photocamera ; representative microscopic fields were photographed by a technical assistant ( V . Necchi ) unaware of the treatment . Assessment of apoptosis To measure the degree of apoptosis of variously treated cell monolayers we used two different assays , the annexin V - labelling assay ( 32 , 33 ) and the uptake of the vital DNA dye Hoechst 33342 ( 34 , 35 ) . The binding of fluorescent annexin V is a widely used approach for the detection of phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface . Indeed , loss of plasma membrane asymmetry is an early event in apoptosis , independent of the cell type , resulting in the exposure of phosphatidylserine residues at the outer plasma membrane leaflet . Annexin V was shown to interact strongly and specifically with phosphatidylserine and can thus be used to detect apoptosis ( 32 , 33 ) . Phosphatidylserine exposure seems to last from the early execution phase of apoptosis until the final stage , at which the cell has broken up into apoptotic bodies ( 32 , 33 ) . When the plasma membrane looses its integrity , the cell becomes positive for both annexin V and non - vital DNA dyes such as propidium iodide , indicating a late apoptotic / necrotic stage of the cell . For annexin V - labelling assay , we used the annexin V - Fluos staining kit from Roche ( Penzberg , Germany ) according to manufacturer ' s instructions . Briefly , at the end of incubation time , the incubation medium was collected and the cell monolayer was splitted by means of TrypLE Express ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , cell suspension was added to the corresponding incubation medium and centrifuged at 150 g for 5 min . Cell pellet was then incubated at RT for 15 min with 0 . 1 ml of annexin V - FITC - containing HEPES buffer . After dilution with 0 . 9 ml of HEPES buffer , each sample was immediately analyzed by flow cytometry . Another specific and sensitive apoptosis assay for unfixed cells is based on the observation that , owing to changes in membrane permeability , early apoptotic cells show an increased uptake of the vital DNA dye Hoechst 33342 compared with non - apoptotic live cells , when stained with the dye at low concentration for a short time ( 34 , 35 ) . Co - staining with a non - vital DNA dye such as propidium iodide or 7 - amino - actinomycin D allows discrimination of either late apoptotic or necrotic cells from early apoptotic cells ( 35 ) . Indeed , late apoptotic cells , which have completely lost membrane integrity , take up the non - vital DNA dye as well , while necrotic cells lose membrane integrity early and become positive for the non - vital DNA dye without passing through a stage of increased uptake of Hoechst 33342 ( 35 ) . For the uptake of Hoechst 33342 dye , cell monolayers were processed as above , each cell pellet was incubated at 37°C for 10 min with 1 ml PBS containing 1 µg / ml Hoechst 33342 and 0 . 1 24 µg / ml propidium iodide , and then immediately analyzed by flow cytometry . Measurement of loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential The uptake of the potential - sensitive dye tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate ( TMRE ) was used to measure relative MTP ( 36 ) . TMRE is a positively charged , lipophilic fluorescent dye commonly used to make qualitative and quantitative measurements of MTP ( 37 ) . Lipophilic cations accumulate in the mitochondrial matrix , driven by the MTP according to the Nernst equation , which states that at 37°C a hyperpolarization by 61 . 5 mV corresponds to a 10 - fold increase in the intramitochondrial concentration of monovalent cations ( 38 ) . Since in physiological conditions the MTP ranges from 120 to 180 mV ( the intramitochondrial side being electronegative ) , the concentration of such cations is normally 2 - 3 logs higher in the mitochondrial matrix than in the cytosol ( 38 ) . Thus a membrane - permeant cationic fluorochrome can be used to measure MTP , whose dissipation is a hallmark of early apoptosis both in vitro and ex vivo ( 39 ) . Briefly , at the end of various incubation times , TMRE ( from Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ; final conc . : 50 nM ) was added to each cell monolayer which was incubated at 37°C for additional 30 min . The incubation medium was then collected and the cell monolayer was splitted by means of TMRE - supplemented TrypLE Express , cell suspension was added to the corresponding incubation medium and centrifuged at 150 g for 5 min . After resuspension in 1 ml of its own supernatant , each sample was immediately analyzed by flow cytometry . Flow cytometry For each sample , at least 20 , 000 events were analyzed by a PAS II flow cytometer ( Partec , Münster , Germany ) equipped with two excitation sources : 1 ) an argon ion laser with 20 mW output power at 488 nm , and 2 ) a 100W mercury arc lamp used for UV excitation . Light emission was measured in the following channels : a ) FL1 ( 510 - 535 nm bandpass filter ) for annexin V - FITC , b ) FL2 ( 540 - 590 nm bandpass filter ) for TMRE , c ) FL3 ( 600 - 650 nm bandpass filter ) for propidium iodide , and d ) FL4 ( 430 - 480 nm bandpass filter ) for Hoechst 33342 . Data were recorded and analyzed using the FlowMax software from Partec . Statistics Results are expressed as means ± SEM of at least 3 independent experiments . The statistical significance of the differences was evaluated by analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by Newman - Keuls ' s Q - test ; significance was set at P < 0 . 05 . RESULTS Flow cytometry permits rapid , quantitative , cell - based determination of apoptosis compared with other classic techniques , such as DNAladder formation by gel electrophoresis and morphological examination by electron or light microscopy ( 35 ) . Many different flow cytometric staining methods that target various cellular attributes of the apoptotic pathway have been developed ( 40 ) . By using annexin V - labelling assay , in preliminary experiments we found that MKN 28 cells underwent VacA - induced apoptosis in a time - and dose - dependent fashion with the peak occurring at 24 h of incubation with 50 nM acid - activated purified VacA ( Fig . 1A , B ) . Therefore , we focused our subsequent analyses on events occurring at this time point with the aforementioned toxin concentration . Figs . 1A , B and 2A , C show that VacA induced a statistically significant apoptosis even in the absence of ammonium chloride . Nevertheless , the addition to the incubation medium of 5 mM ammonium chloride ( i . e . , a concentration well within the in vivo range for H . pylori - infected patients ( 41 ) and which is the most commonly used to reveal ammonia - dependent effects of purified VacA on cultured epithelial cells ( 22 - 24 ) ) did not induce apoptosis by itself in our cellular model , but significantly increased the apoptotic action of VacA ( Fig . 2A , C ) . To assess whether ammonia - dependent increase in apoptosis was accounted for by ammonia - dependent vacuole development , we carried out another set of experiments in which vacuole formation was blocked by treating cells with a specific inhibitor of the endosomal V - ATPase ( i . e . , BAFA1 ) . As shown in Fig . 2B , C , ammonia exhibited an increasing action on VacA - induced apoptosis also in BAFA1 - treated cells in which no vacuolation occurred under phase - contrast microscopy evaluation ( Fig . 3 ) . By using Hoechst 33342 / propidium iodide - labelling assay , we found that MKN 28 cell monolayers treated with VacA for 24 h in the absence of ammonium chloride exhibited a statistically significant increase in both early and late apoptotic cells compared to control cells ( Fig . 4A , C ) . When MKN 28 cell monolayers were treated with VacA for 24 h in the presence of 5 mM ammonium chloride , we found an increased percentage of early apoptotic cells compared to monolayers treated with VacA alone , while we found no difference in the percentage of late apoptotic cells ( Fig . 4A , C ) . The same behaviour was observed also in BAFA1 - treated cells ( Fig . 4B , C ) further confirming that the potentiating action of ammonia on VacA - induced apoptosis was not accounted for by ammonia - dependent vacuole development . 25 A B 0 10 20 30 40 50 0 25 50 75 VacA concentration ( nM ) 0 8 16 24 0 25 50 75 Incubation time ( h ) A nn ex i n V - po s i t i ve ce ll s ( % ) * * * * * * Fig . 1 .

Taking that it is now widely accepted that VacA causes apoptosis through the intrinsic ( i . e . , mitochondria - dependent ) pathway ( 6 , 18 , 24 , 36 ) , we finally investigated the effect of VacA and ammonia on the MTP of MKN 28 cells in culture by measuring TMRE uptake in variously treated cell monolayers . By flow cytometry evaluation of TMRE uptake , we found that MKN 28 cell monolayers treated with VacA for 24 h in the absence of ammonium chloride exhibited a statistically significant decrease in MTP compared to control cells ( Fig . 5A , C ) . Nevertheless , the addition to the incubation medium of 5 mM ammonium chloride , a concentration not significantly affecting MTP by itself in our cellular model , significantly potentiated the VacA - induced decrease in MTP ( Fig . 5A , C ) . Once again , the potentiating action of ammonia was not accounted for by ammonia - dependent vacuole development since it was completely preserved in BAFA1 - treated cells ( Fig . 5B , C ) . 26 Control A C e ll c oun t FL1 Fluorescence Intensity ( log ) 480 240 R1 R1 R1 0 R2 R2 R2 0 . 1 1 10 0 . 1 100 0 . 1 1 10 100 0 . 1 1 10 100 R1 R2 1 10 100 VacA + NH 4 Cl Control + NH 4 Cl VacA 480 Control B C e ll c oun t FL1 Fluorescence Intensity ( log ) 240 R1 R1 R1 0 R2 R1 R2 R2 R2 0 . 1 1 10 0 . 1 1 10 100 100 0 . 1 1 10 100 0 . 1 1 10 100 VacA + NH 4 Cl Control + NH 4 Cl VacA R2 cells ( % ) w / o BAFA1 with BAFA1 Control 19 ± 2 15 ± 2 Control + NH 4 Cl 21 ± 2 19 ± 2 VacA 59 ± 3 ° 63 ± 4 ° VacA + NH 4 Cl 75 ± 4 ° * 80 ± 5 ° * C Fig . 2 .

Note that VacA was causing cell vacuolation only in the presence of ammonium chloride ( which by itself caused the development of a few small vacuoles only ) . BAFA1 was able to completely inhibit cell vacuolation ( induced either by ammonium chloride alone or by VacA in the presence of ammonium chloride ) without causing , by itself , any apparent cell damage . Original magnification : x100 . To investigate whether the potentiating activity of ammonia on VacA - induced action was might accounted for by a specific effect of this substance or , on the contrary , also other weak bases may exert a similar action , we performed a set of experiments using 0 . 1 mM chloroquine instead of 5 mM ammonium chloride . Chloroquine is a weak base known to have an action similar to that of ammonia in the development of VacA - dependent cell vacuolation ( 17 , 42 ) . We found that chloroquine as well was able to potentiate both apoptosis and MTP decrease induced by VacA causing , compared to cells treated with VacA in the absence of chloroquine , a ) a statistically significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) increase in annexin V labelling either in the absence or presence of BAFA1 treatment ( 30 ± 4 % and 28 ± 4 % , respectively ) , and b ) a statistically significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) decrease in TMRE uptake either in the absence or presence of BAFA1 treatment ( 32 ± 5 % and 35 ± 4 % , respectively ) . DISCUSSION H . pylori is a main causative agent of gastric cancer that , despite its declining incidence , remains the fourth most common cancer , the second leading cause of cancer - related death , and the fourteenth most common cause of death overall worldwide , killing more than 700 , 000 people each year ( 2 , 3 ) . It is thus of highest interest to better understand the molecular mechanism by which this microorganism interacts with its human host so as to trigger potentially harmful sequelae . It is now widely accepted that the exotoxin VacA is one of the most important virulence factors produced by H . pylori even though neither its role nor its molecular mechanisms of action are completely understood ( 3 , 6 , 7 , 9 ) . Our group demonstrated that VacA , first considered as a toxin inducing only cell vacuolation , was in fact promoting apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells by targeting mitochondria ( 18 ) . 27 C F L 3 F l uo r e s ce n ce I n t e n s it y ( l og ) A 10 100 1 0 . 1 Control 10 100 1 0 . 1 Control + NH 4 Cl 10 100 1 0 . 1 VacA 10 100 1 0 . 1 1 10 100 VacA + NH 4 Cl B 10 100 1 0 . 1 Control 10 100 1 0 . 1 Control + NH 4 Cl 10 100 1 0 . 1 VacA 10 100 1 0 . 1 1 10 100 VacA + NH 4 Cl FL4 Fluorescence Intensity ( log ) R2 cells ( % ) w / o BAFA1 withBAFA1 Control 10 ± 2 14 ± 2 Control + NH 4 Cl 12 ± 2 13 ± 2 VacA 30 ± 3 ° 32 ± 3 ° VacA + NH 4 Cl 49 ± 4 ° * 46 ± 4 ° * R3 cells ( % ) w / o BAFA1 withBAFA1 Control 12 ± 2 13 ± 2 Control + NH 4 Cl 14 ± 2 16 ± 2 VacA 24 ± 4 ° 20 ± 2 ° VacA + NH 4 Cl 22 ± 3 ° 23 ± 3 ° R1 R2 R3 R1 R2 R3 R1 R2 R3 R1 R2 R3 R1 R2 R3 R1 R2 R3 R1 R2 R3 R1 R2 R3 Fig . 4 .

Means ± SEM of 3 independent experiments . ° , P < 0 . 05 versus control ; * , P < 0 . 05 versus VacA . The apoptotic activity of VacA via mitochondria has been confirmed by several groups and is now widely accepted as a main activity of this toxin ( 7 , 22 , 43 ) . Nevertheless , it is still unclear how VacAexerts its apoptotic action . For instance , it is completely unknown how VacA reaches mitochondria where it could trigger apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial membrane changes correlated to toxin channel activity ( 6 , 18 , 36 , 43 ) . In this respect , confirming our previous finding ( 15 ) that most of VacA was localized to vacuoles rather than mitochondria , Yamasaki et al . ( 24 ) suggested that VacA might trigger mitochondria - dependent apoptosis without directly reaching mitochondria but rather activating the proapoptotic Bcl - 2 family protein Bax through a yet unidentified mechanism . However , it is worth noting that a common feature of bacterial toxins is that only a small fraction of the overall amount of toxin internalized by the cell is sufficient to fully exert the toxic action ; for instance , in the case of diphtheria toxin , one molecule escaping endosomes and reaching the cytosol is sufficient to kill the cell ( 44 ) . A hotly debated question about VacA cytotoxic action is its relationship with ammonia , which is produced in vivo by H . pylori urease . It is widely accepted that ammonia is strictly required for the development of VacA - dependent vacuolation ( 15 , 17 ) ; on the contrary , its role in VacA - induced apoptosis is much less defined . The observation of Cover et al . ( 22 ) that also VacA - induced apoptosis was strictly dependent on the presence of ammonia raised the intriguing hypothesis that H . pylori might have developed a novel , highly ingenious strategy to allow its toxin to reach , after cell internalization by endocytosis , its ultimate cell target ( i . e . , the mitochondrion ) : ammonia - dependent swelling and rupture of endosomal vesicles in which VacA is sequestered . Nevertheless , it was found that vacuolation was not a prerequisite for VacA - induced mitochondrial damage ( 23 ) , even though ammonia exerted a potentiating action on VacA - induced apoptosis ( 24 ) . The results here presented clearly show that , unlike cell vacuolation , in MKN 28 cells neither apoptosis nor MTP dissipation induced by VacA require ammonia . Nevertheless , ammonia significantly potentiates both these VacA - induced effects , but independently of the swelling of VacA - containing endosomes ( i . e . , vacuolation ) since ammonia - dependent potentiation is present also in BAFA1 - treated cells in which vacuole genesis is completely abolished . In addition , we found that the potentiating activity of ammonia on VacA - induced action is not accounted for by a specific effect of this substance taking that other weak bases ( like chloroquine ) may exert a similar action either in the absence or presence of BAFA1 treatment and thus independently of vacuole genesis . Thus our findings make unlikely the vesicle rupture model as an escape mechanism for VacA to reach mitochondria . Ammonia ( and other weak bases ) might act either causing an overall cell stress that favours Bax recruitment to mitochondria or directly sensitizing mitochondria to VacA - induced damage ( 45 ) . Interestingly , our group has recently demonstrated that dynamic comet - like F - actin structures play a pivotal role in intracellular trafficking of VacA connecting the GPI - anchored protein - enriched early endosomal compartment , where VacA is initially endocytosed , to late endosomes where vacuolation occurs 28 C R1 cells ( % ) w / o BAFA1 with BAFA1 Control 20 ± 2 23 ± 2 Control + NH 4 Cl 26 ± 2 26 ± 2 VacA 46 ± 4 ° 49 ± 4 ° VacA + NH 4 Cl 61 ± 5 ° * 63 ± 4 ° * R1 R2 A Control C e ll c oun t FL2 Fluorescence Intensity ( log ) 400 200 0 0 . 1 1 10 0 . 1 100 0 . 1 1 10 100 0 . 1 1 10 100 1 10 100 VacA + NH 4 Cl Control + NH 4 Cl R1 R2 VacA R1 R2 R1 R2 VacA R1 R2 R1 R2 B Control C e ll c oun t FL2 Fluorescence Intensity ( log ) 400 200 0 0 . 1 1 10 0 . 1 100 0 . 1 1 10 100 0 . 1 1 10 100 1 10 100 VacA + NH 4 Cl Control + NH 4 Cl VacA R2 R1 R1 R2 Fig . 5 .

A possible scenario could thus envisage an early delivery of some VacA molecules to mitochondria by direct interaction between these organelles and the highly motile VacA - containing vesicles propelled by dynamic F - actin tails . In this respect , it is worth noting that organelle to organelle contact between iron - containing early endosomes and mitochondria has been reported as a likely mechanism to replenish mitochondrial iron by direct transfer ( 47 ) . This early arrival of a small amount of VacA molecules could trigger an initially limited mitochondrial damage ( with decreased MTP and cytochrome c release ) but sufficient to trigger the amplification loop recently described by Lakhani et al . ( 48 ) with Bax activation and translocation to mitochondria in turn causing further mitochondrial damage . Ammonia could play a role ( even though yet undefined ) in this amplification loop . Our recent observation ( Oldani et al . , manuscript in preparation ) , using the ratiometric potential - sensitive dye JC - 1 and confocal microscopy , of focal MTP decrease induced by VacA in MKN 28 cells as early as 1 hour after toxin exposure and not affected by the presence or absence of ammonia further supports this hypothesis . This model would reconcile previous findings suggesting the need for VacA - induced apoptosis of a direct damaging action of VacA on mitochondria ( 18 , 36 ) with those stressing the role of Bax recruitment ( 24 ) .
