L E T T E R S Embryonic stem cells require Wnt proteins to prevent differentiation to epiblast stem cells Derk ten Berge 1 , 2 , 4 , Dorota Kurek 1 , Tim Blauwkamp 2 , Wouter Koole 2 , Alex Maas 3 , Elif Eroglu 2 , Ronald K . Siu 2 and Roel Nusse 2 Pluripotent stem cells exist in naive and primed states , epitomized by mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) and the developmentally more advanced epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ; ref . 1 ) . In the naive state of ESCs , the genome has an unusual open conformation and possesses a minimum of repressive epigenetic marks 2 . In contrast , EpiSCs have activated the epigenetic machinery that supports differentiation towards the embryonic cell types 3 – 6 . The transition from naive to primed pluripotency therefore represents a pivotal event in cellular differentiation . But the signals that control this fundamental differentiation step remain unclear . We show here that paracrine and autocrine Wnt signals are essential self - renewal factors for ESCs , and are required to inhibit their differentiation into EpiSCs . Moreover , we ﬁnd that Wnt proteins in combination with the cytokine LIF are sufﬁcient to support ESC self - renewal in the absence of any undeﬁned factors , and support the derivation of new ESC lines , including ones from non - permissive mouse strains . Our results not only demonstrate that Wnt signals regulate the naive - to - primed pluripotency transition , but also identify Wnt as an essential and limiting ESC self - renewal factor . We visualized activation of the Wnt pathway in ESCs using R1 cells carrying the Wnt reporter 7xTcf – eGFP ( enhanced green fluorescent protein ; ref . 7 ) , cultured on mouse embryo fibroblast ( MEF ) feeder layers . ESC colonies with sharp boundaries and hard - to - distinguish individual cells — characteristics of undifferentiated colonies — showed higher levels of reporter activity than flattened colonies with distinct individual cells ( Fig . 1a , b ) . We verified the Wnt responsiveness of the reporter by its induction by purified Wnt3a protein ( Fig . 1c , d ) , and by its extinction by the Wnt antagonist Fz8CRD , a soluble domain of the Wnt receptor that binds and sequesters Wnt proteins ( Fig . 1e , f ) . These data demonstrate that R1 ESCs grown on MEFs experience paracrine or autocrine stimulation by Wnt ligands . Indeed , Wnts are expressed by ESCsthemselves ( SupplementaryFig . S1a ) andbyMEFs ( ref . 8 ) . 1 Erasmus MC Stem Cell Institute , Department of Cell Biology , Erasmus Medical Center , P . O .

Cells with less eGFP were less likely to establish colonies positive for the ESC marker alkaline phosphatase ( Fig . 1g ) . Moreover , a higher percentage of cells formed colonies when plated in the presence of Wnt3a protein ( Fig . 1g ) , demonstratingthatendogenousWntligandssupportESCself - renewal . To quantify to what extent ESC self - renewal depends on Wnt signals , we measured the expansion of cells able to establish alkaline phosphatase - positive colonies in the presence of Fz8CRD over three passages at clonal density . The Wnt antagonist reduced , and at high concentration completely suppressed , self - renewal ( Fig . 1h and Supplementary Fig . S1b ) . This effect was countered by addition of Wnt3a protein ( Fig . 1h and Supplementary Fig . S1b ) , demonstrating that it relied on the Wnt - binding ability of Fz8CRD . Furthermore , ESC self - renewal was also suppressed by the small - molecule inhibitor IWP2 , which interferes with the ability of cells to produce active Wnt proteins by blocking Porcupine , an enzyme essential for acylating Wnt proteins 9 ( Fig . 1i ) . Importantly , this effect was rescued by addition of Wnt3a protein ( Fig . 1i ) , demonstrating that the inhibition is specific for Wnt signal production . Thus , endogenous Wnt ligands are essential for self - renewal of R1 ESCs . ESC lines such as E14 and CGR8 self - renew in the absence of MEFs , indicating that they produce sufficient Wnt proteins themselves . Using E14 ESCs carrying a LacZ reporter targeted into the Wnt target gene Axin2 ( ref . 10 ; also known as Conductin ) , we indeed detected widespread reporter activation in the absence of MEFs ( Fig . 1j ) . This was due to endogenous Wnt proteins as the reporter was extinguished by IWP2 and by Fz8CRD , which was counteracted by the addition of Wnt3a protein ( Fig . 1j – o ) . E14 ESCs therefore produce active Wnt proteins . In addition , we found that CGR8 ESCs also express Wnt - encodinggenesintheabsenceofMEFs ( SupplementaryFig . S1a ) . Inhibition of the endogenous Wnt signals by Fz8CRD or IWP2 resulted in differentiation of both E14tg2a and CGR8 cells , as indicated by the loss of alkaline phosphatase expression ( Fig . 1p , r , t 1070 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2011 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

( a , c , e ) Phase - contrast microscopy ; ( b , d , f ) eGFP . ( g ) The ability of 7xTcf – eGFP cells to form alkaline phosphatase - positive ( AP + ) colonies in the absence of MEFs correlated with the level of eGFP , and was enhanced by the presence of Wnt3a protein ( mean ± s . e . m . , n = 3 ) . ( h ) The expansion of R1 ESCs able to form alkaline phosphatase - positive colonies on MEFs was progressively repressed by increasing concentrations of the Wnt antagonist Fz8CRD . This effect was counteracted by simultaneous addition of Wnt3a protein ( mean + s . e . m . , n = 3 ) . ( i ) The expansion of R1 ESCs able to establish alkaline phosphatase - positive colonies on MEFs was repressed by IWP2 . This repression was relieved by simultaneous addition of Wnt3a protein ( 240ngml − 1 ) ( mean + s . e . m . , n = 3 ) .

( v ) The expansion of CGR8 ESCs able to form alkaline phosphatase - positive colonies in the absence of MEFs was repressed by IWP2 or 500ngml − 1 Fz8CRD , and promoted by 200ngml − 1 Wnt3a protein . Scale bars , 100 µ m ( a – f , j – o ) , 500 µ m ( p – u ) . and Supplementary Fig . S2a ) . Again , addition of Wnt3a protein rescued these effects ( Fig . 1p – u and Supplementary Fig . S2a ) . We next quantified the effect of Wnt inhibition on the self - renewal on CGR8 cells and the E14 sublines E14tg2a and IB10 . At clonal density , self - renewal of these ESC lines was very limited , indicating the importance of paracrine signalling ( Fig . 1v and Supplementary Fig . S2b ) . The remaining self - renewal ability was eliminated by Fz8CRD or IWP2 , indicating that it depended on endogenous Wnt signals ( Fig . 1v and Supplementary Fig . S2b ) . Furthermore , addition of Wnt3a protein strongly promoted self - renewal at clonal density ( Fig . 1v and Supplementary Fig . S2b ) , further confirming that Wnt proteins are the paracrine factors necessary for ESC self - renewal . Interestingly , when R1 ESCs were cultured on MEFs in the presence of IWP2 , they started to resemble EpiSCs , losing alkaline phosphatase expression and acquiring a flattened morphology ( Fig . 2a ) . The colonies remained positive for the ESC and EpiSC markers Oct4 and Nanog , and induced the EpiSC markers Claudin6 and Otx2 ( ref . 4 ; Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . S3a ) . To confirm that the ESCs differentiated towards EpiSCs , we passaged the cells as small clumps using collagenase IV , as is required to preserve EpiSCs ( refs 3 , 4 ) , and evaluated their marker profile , growth - factor dependence and epigenetic state . In the presence of IWP2 , only Oct4 - positive colonies negativeforalkalinephosphataseexpanded ( Fig . 2bandSupplementary Fig . S3a ) , andthecellsacquiredamarker - geneexpressionprofilesimilar to that of EpiSCs ( Fig . 2c ) . Furthermore , similarly to EpiSCs , IWP2 - treated ESCs became dependent on Activin / Nodal signalling through the ALK receptors ( ActivinA receptors , type 1 ) , as colony formation was severely repressed by the ALK inhibitor SB431542 ( Fig . 2d ) . Finally , EpiSCs differ from ESCs in their epigenetic state , most markedly shown by the presence of an inactive X chromosome in female EpiSCs . Indeed , IWP2 treatment of female ESCs induced the formation of trimethyl histone H3 Lys 27 ( H3K27me3 ) foci , which is diagnostic for the inactive X chromosome ( Fig . 2e – g ) . In addition , the treated cells activated the DNA methylation machinery as shown by the induction of the de novo DNA methylase gene Dnmt3b ( Fig . 2c ) . Combined , these data demonstrate that Wnt signals are required to inhibit the differentiation of ESCs into EpiSCs . This is in agreement with a report that ESCs mutant for the Wnt signal transducer β - catenin ( also known as Ctnnb1 ) showamorphologyandmarkerpatternsimilartothatofEpiSCs 11 . ESCs readily differentiate into EpiSCs on transfer to EpiSC medium 6 , and we tested whether Wnt3a protein would be sufficient to block this transition . R1 ESCs plated in serum - free N2B27 medium supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , ActivinA and LIF rapidly acquired EpiSC character , as indicated by FACS analysis for the NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2011 1071 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

In contrast , differentiation was inhibited in the presence of Wnt3a ( Fig . 3a ) . Remarkably , the differentiation was even quicker and more efficient in the presence of IWP2 ( Fig . 3a ) , indicating that endogenous Wnt signals interfered with EpiSC differentiation . Gene expression analysis showed profiles consistent with ESCs or EpiSCs in the presence of Wnt3a or IWP2 , respectively ( Fig . 3b ) . Withdrawal of LIF in the presence of Wnt3a caused loss of the cells , indicating that , although sufficient to inhibit EpiSC differentiation , Wnt3a is insufficient to maintain ESCs on its own . Combined , the data show that Wnt proteins are necessary and sufficienttoinhibitthedifferentiationofESCstowardsEpiSCs . ESCs originate from the inner cell mass ( ICM ) of blastocyst - stage embryos , and interestingly we found activity of the Wnt signalling reporter Axin2 LacZ in this tissue ( Fig . 3c , d ) . This is consistent with the expression of several Wnts and nuclear β - catenin in the blastocyst 12 , 13 . However , the reporter was extinguished on implantation ( Fig . 3e and Supplementary Fig . S3b , c ) , when the ICM differentiates towards post - implantation epiblast , the source of EpiSCs . These observations are consistent with a possible physiological role for Wnt in regulating this differentiation step during normal development . Although β - catenin knockout embryos develop through the blastocyst stage 14 , this may be explained by the presence of maternal β - catenin 15 , 16 . Alternatively , transient abnormalities , such as premature differentiationofICMintoepiblast , mighthavegoneunnoticed , orWnt signals might be required for maintenance of the ICM during delayed implantation , as observed for LIF / gp130 signalling 17 . Our results demonstrate that the combination of Wnt and LIF signals is essential for ESC self - renewal , and we next tested whether this combination was also sufficient .

S4a , b ) . In N2B27 + LIF + Wnt3a , the cells adhered poorly to gelatin - coated surfaces but plating efficiency was restored by further fibronectin coating , and the expansion was then similar to that on MEFs ( compare Fig . 4a , f ) . No adaptation period was necessary for culture in N2B27 + LIF + Wnt3a . The cells formed colonies with a distinct , dome - shaped morphology that stained intensely for alkaline phosphatase ( compare Fig . 4c , d ) , and real - time PCR analysis demonstrated normal expression levels of ESC markers ( Fig . 4e ) . 5 - bromodeoxyuridine analysis revealed no role of Wnt3a in proliferation , indicating that inhibition of differentiation is its main function in self - renewal ( Supplementary Fig . S4c ) . Using single - cell deposition in N2B27 + LIF + Wnt3a , R1 cells formed colonies in 55 out of 95 wells . Several clones were further expanded over the course of eight passages ( 24 days ) and functionally tested by blastocyst injections , resulting in chimaeras with high coat - colour chimaerism , a strong sex distortion in favour of males and a highproportionofgermlinetransmission ( SupplementaryTableS1and Fig . S4d ) . TheseresultsdemonstratethatWnt3aproteinincombination with LIF is sufficient to support self - renewal of germline - competent ESCsatsimilarefficienciestoserumandMEFs , evenatclonaldensity . An alternative way to activate the Wnt pathway is by inhibiting the glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK3 ) kinases , which stabilizes β - catenin 18 ( Supplementary Fig . S4e ) . However , the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 was less effective than Wnt3a in supporting clonal expansion of ESCs ( Fig . 4f ) , indicating that the other effects of GSK3 inhibition 19 are disadvantageous . Further concerns about GSK3 inhibition arise from its interference with chromosomal alignment at mitosis and from its induction of chromosome instability 20 , 21 . Recently , the combined inhibition of the GSK3 and MAP - kinase kinase ( MEK ) kinases was reported to support ESC self - renewal in the absence of LIF ( ref . 22 ) . We found that , in combination with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 , Wnt3a protein was as effective as CHIR99021 in supporting limited self - renewal ( Fig . 4f ) . The self - renewal effect of GSK3 inhibition can therefore be ascribed to its ability to activate the Wnt pathway , consistent with a recent report 23 . Interestingly , in the presence of LIF , MEK inhibitor lowered the requirement for Wnt protein in ESC self - renewal ( compare Fig . 4g and b ) , but provided no benefit when sufficient Wnt3a protein was provided ( Fig . 4f and Supplementary Fig . S4f ) . MEK inhibition did not activate the Wnt pathway , as neither the 7xTcf – eGFP reporter nor the Axin2 LacZ reporter responded to PD0325901 in ESCs ( not shown ) , nor did Wnt3a inhibit the MEK pathway ( Fig . 4h ) , suggesting that the interaction between these pathways is further downstream . We next investigated the effect of Wnt on ESC derivation , using N2B27 medium in the absence of MEFs . ESC derivation from whole blastocysts of the mouse strain 129Sv was 96 % efficient when Wnt3a and LIF were combined with the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 , which aids ESC derivation by preventing the differentiation of ICM into primitive endoderm in whole - blastocyst culture 24 ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . Following derivation , Wnt3a and LIF were sufficient to support expansion of the new lines . The newly derived cells stained positive for alkaline phosphatase , Oct4 and Nanog ( Supplementary Fig . S5a ) , and several lines contributed to germline chimaeras following blastocyst injections ( Supplementary Table S3 and Fig . S5b ) . Most mouse strains are non - permissive for ESC derivation ; that is , no ESCs develop from embryos cultured on MEFs in the presence of LIF ( ref . 25 ) . However , we readily derived ESCs NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2011 1073 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved .

The new lines stained positive for alkaline phosphatase , Oct4 and Nanog ( Fig . 5a – c and Supplementary Fig . S5a ) , several lines contributed to high - percentage chimaeras ( Supplementary Table S4 ) and germline transmission was observed from line FN3 ( Fig . 5d ) . Following derivation , Wnt3a and LIF were sufficient to support expansion of FVB / N ESCs ( Fig . 5e ) . We found that FVB / N ESCs required Wnt3a supplementation for expansion on MEFs ( Fig . 5f ) , indicating that MEFs provide insufficient Wnt ligands to support them . Non - permissive ESCs therefore differ from their permissive counterparts by an increased requirement for Wnt ligands . This work shows that ESC self - renewal depends on extrinsic Wnt signals , and identifies the Wnt pathway as a regulatory signal between ESCs and EpiSCs . Moreover , we show that the combination of Wnt3a protein with LIF is sufficient to support the expansion of germline - competent ESCs , at clonal efficiencies similar to those obtainedwithfeeders . WntsignalsmayinhibitdifferentiationtoEpiSCs through the transcription factor TCF3 , which regulates the expression of multiple - pluripotency genes 26 – 28 . A function of Wnt signals in ESCs has been suspected since it was reported that Apc modulates the differentiation of ESCs through the β - catenin pathway 29 . Although subsequent reports demonstrated that Wnt ligands can improve ESC self - renewal 30 – 32 , no requirement or specific function for Wnt signals in ESC self - renewal had been established . In fact , for some time it has been unclear whether the self - renewing state of ESCs requires extrinsic signals or is autonomous . Although the cytokine LIF had been identified as an essential ESC self - renewal factor 33 , 34 , a recent report shows that combined inhibition of the MEK signal transducers and the GSK3 kinases ( 2i condition ) is sufficient to support ESC self - renewal 22 , suggesting that extracellular factors are not required . However , GSK3 inhibition has many effects 19 , among which is activation of the Wnt signalling pathway 18 . Our demonstration that Wnt3a can substitute for the GSK3 inhibitor in the 2i condition indicates that the effect of GSK3 inhibition can be ascribed to its ability to activate the Wnt pathway . The hitherto unappreciated requirement for Wnt signals for ESC self - renewal may have implications for the establishment of naive pluripo - tent cells from other species , including humans . This is underscored by our demonstration that Wnt3a protein supports the derivation of germline - competent ESCs from non - permissive FVB mice . The Wnt requirement also explains findings of an instable naive state in repro - 1074 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 13 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2011 © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

In the absence of MEFs , derivation was carried out in N2B27 medium containing 1 , 000Uml − 1 LIF . Wnt3a protein or the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 was added as indicated to a concentration of 300ngml − 1 or 1 µ M , respectively . When both Wnt3a and MEK inhibitor were added , the MEK inhibitor was removed after the outgrowths were passaged . After 6 days , outgrowths were trypsinized and transferred to fresh 96 - well plates . Newlyformedcelllineswereexpandedforaminimumofsevenpassages , and analysedbyalkalinephosphatase , NanogandOct4stainingandblastocystinjections using C57Bl / 6 host blastocysts . The percentage of coat colour chimaerism of the chimaeras was estimated visually . To determine germline transmission , chimaeras from 129Sv - derived ESCs were mated with C57Bl / 6 mice , and chimaeras from FVB / N - derived ESCs were mated with FVB / N mice .

COM / NATURECELLBIOLOGY 3 Figure S3 Wnt signals are required to inhibit the differentiation of ESCs into EpiSCs . ( a ) R1 ESCs were cultured on MEFs in medium with serum and LIF supplemented with 2 µM IWP2 as indicated , passaged every 3 days as small clumps using Collagenase IV , and stained at every passage for AP and Oct4 . Shown are representative fields of view of the experiment that is quantified in Fig . 2b . ( b ) To determine whether Axin2 LacZ in the E5 . 5 epiblast responds to the Wnt / beta - catenin pathway , E5 . 5 Axin2 LacZ / + embryos were cultured for 24 hrs in the presence of the GSK3 - inhibitor CHIR99021 or vehicle , and stained with X - gal . Red arrow points to the epiblast . Blue staining in the epiblast indicates that the reporter is able to respond to activation of the Wnt / beta - catenin pathway . ( c ) To confirm that the Axin2 LacZ reporter is able to respond to Wnt proteins , EpiSCs were derived from E5 . 5 Axin2 LacZ / + embryos , cultured in N2B27 containing bFGF and ActivinA , treated with the indicated factors for 2 days , and stained with X - gal and Nuclear Red . The cells display weak local spontaneous activation of the reporter which is repressed by IWP2 and Fz8CRD , indicating that it is the result of endogenous Wnt proteins . Treatment with Wnt3a protein ( 200 ng / ml ) induced the reporter , confirming that it is indeed responsive to Wnt proteins . Scale bars : 500 μm ( a , c ) , 25 μm ( b ) .

R1 ESCs were plated in N2B27 medium containing LIF or Wnt3a as indicated , and cultured for the indicated amount of time . The cells were then labeled with BrdU for 4 hrs , counted , and the amount of incorporated BrdU determined using the Roche Cell Proliferation ELISA . The results are plotted as BrdU incorporation normalized for cell count . Using one - way ANOVA , no significant difference was observed between the different media regardless of culture duration ( p > 0 . 05 ) . Results shown are the mean±s . e . m , n = 4 .
