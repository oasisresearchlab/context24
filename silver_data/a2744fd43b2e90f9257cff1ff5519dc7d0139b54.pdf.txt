Introduction Mitosis is the period of the cell cycle during which chromosomes are segregated to daughter cells . The centromere is a component of the chromosome that is required for accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis in eukaryotes . Centromere functions include sister chromatid cohesion and separation , microtubule attachment , chromosome movement and mitotic checkpoint control ( Choo , 1997 ; Pidoux and Allshire , 2000 ; Sullivan et al . , 2001 ) . Because problems in chromosome segregation can lead to aneuploidy , cancer and cell death , we must understand the mechanism by which centromeres interact with the microtubules of the spindle apparatus during cell division . The vertebrate centromere is a trilaminar plate structure ( Pluta et al . , 1995 ; Craig et al . , 1999 ) . A number of centromere proteins have been identiﬁed in higher vertebrates . Proteins located in the inner plate , including CENP - A , - C , - H and - I , are required for formation of the kinetochore structure ( Saitoh et al . , 1992 ; Tomkiel et al . , 1994 ; Warburton et al . , 1997 ; Fukagawa et al . , 1999a ; Fukagawa et al . , 2001 ; Howman et al . , 2000 ; Sugata et al . , 2000 ; Nishihashi et al . , 2002 ) . Motor proteins and spindle checkpoint proteins such as CENP - E and Mad / Bub family proteins are associated with the outer plate ( Cooke et al . , 1997 ; Jablonski et al . , 1998 ) . Genetic approaches have been taken to understand the molecular mechanism underlying centromere formation in vertebrates , and several molecular mechanisms for centromere formation in cells of higher vertebrates been reported ( Howman et al . , 2000 ; Fukagawa et al . , 2001 ; Nishihashi et al . , 2002 ) . To further understand the mechanisms underlying centromere formation and function , it is necessary to characterize centromere components . The Ndc80p complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been identiﬁed as a spindle pole component ( Wigge et al . , 1998 ) . Further analysis has shown that the Ndc80p complex , which contains Ndc80p , Spc24p , Spc25p and Nuf2p , is associated with the yeast centromere ( Janke et al . , 2001 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ; He et al . , 2001 ) . Two of the components , Ndc80p and Nuf2p , have homologues in S . pombe , C . elegans and vertebrates ( Nabetani et al . , 2001 ; Howe et al . , 2001 ; McCleland et al . , 2003 ) . The human homologue of Ndc80p , Hec1 , was originally identiﬁed as a retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) - associated protein . Microinjection of Hec1 antibodies into cultured cells disrupts mitotic progression ( Chen et al . , 1997 ) . Recently , Martin - Lluesma et al . ( Martin - Lluesma et al . , 2002 ) reported that human Hec1 is required for recruitment of spindle checkpoint components , including Mps1 and Mad1 / Mad2 complexes , to centromeres . It has also been reported that the human homologue of Nuf2p localizes to centromeres during M phase and is related to mitotic function 3347 Nuf2 and Hec1 are evolutionarily conserved centromere proteins . To clarify the functions of these proteins in vertebrate cells , we characterized them in chicken DT40 cells . We generated GFP fusion constructs of Nuf2 and Hec1 to examine in detail the localization of these proteins during the cell cycle . We found that Nuf2 is associated with Hec1 throughout the cell cycle and that this complex is localized to the centrosomes during G1 and S phases and then moves through the nuclear membrane to the centromere in G2 phase . During mitosis , this complex is localized to the centromere . We also created conditional loss - of - function mutants of Nuf2 and Hec1 . In both mutants , the cell cycle arrested at prometaphase , suggesting that the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex is essential for mitotic progression . The inner centromere proteins CENP - A , - C , and - H and checkpoint protein BubR1 were localized to chromosomes in the mutant cells arrested at prometaphase , but Mad2 localization was abolished . Furthermore , photobleaching experiments revealed that the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex is stably associated with the centromere and that interaction of this complex with the centrosome is dynamic .

We hypothesized that both Hec1 and Nuf2 play important roles in mitotic progression in vertebrate cells . However , it is unclear whether these proteins form a complex in vertebrate cells or how such a complex functions in cell cycle regulation . How this complex is involved in assembly of the vertebrate centromere is also of interest . Although much of the detailed analysis of the Ndc80p complex has been in yeast , we used chicken DT40 cells because they have a high level of homologous recombination and condensed mitotic chromosomes that are easily seen under light microscopy ( Fukagawa et al . , 1999a ; Fukagawa et al . , 2001 ; Nishihashi et al . , 2002 ) . In addition , structures such as the mitotic spindle , centrosome , and centromere in DT40 cells are much larger and more elaborate than the analogous structures in yeast . Furthermore , the stages of mitosis ( prometaphase chromosome congression , metaphase , and transition to anaphase ) are easily distinguished under light microscopy in DT40 cells . To complement previous studies in yeasts , we isolated the chicken homologues of Nuf2 and Ndc80 ( Hec1 ) for further analysis . We found that Nuf2 binds tightly to Hec1 throughout the cell cycle and that the complex localizes to the centrosome in G1 and S phases , moves to the centromere during early G2 phase , and remains at the centromere until completion of mitosis . Furthermore , we describe the generation of conditional loss - of - function mutants of both Nuf2 and Hec1 in DT40 cells to evaluate the in vivo functions of these proteins in higher vertebrates . Phenotypic analysis of these mutants revealed that both Nuf2 and Hec1 play essential roles in the formation of functional centromeres and in the progression of mitosis . Photobleaching experiments showed that interaction of the complex with the centromere is relatively stable , whereas interaction with centrosomes is dynamic . Materials and Methods Molecular biology The chicken Nuf2 and Hec1 cDNAs were cloned by screening a chicken testis cDNA library ( Stratagene ) with the RT - PCR products as a probe . We used the chicken Nuf2 and Hec1 cDNAs as a probe to isolate genomic clones speciﬁc for Nuf2 and Hec1 from a DT40 genomic DNA library . The knockout constructs were created by a standard molecular biology technique . To generate the expression construct for the Nuf2 - GFP and Hec1 - GFP fusion genes , the full - length cDNAs were inserted into pEGFP - N1 plasmid ( Clontech ) . To make the expression construct for the Hec1 - HcRed , a full - length Hec1 cDNA was inserted into pHcRed - N1 plasmid ( Clontech ) . An expression construct for GFP - tubulin ( pEGFP - Tub ) was purchased from Clontech . Cell culture and cell cycle analysis DT40 cells were cultured and transfected as described previously ( Fukagawa and Brown , 1997 ) . Cell cycle analysis was carried out as described previously ( Fukagawa et al . , 2001 ) . Flow - cytometry was performed with an Epics Altra cytometer ( Beckman - Coulter ) . Antibody production A chicken Nuf2 expression construct ( amino acids 91 - 293 ) and a chicken Hec1 expression construct ( amino acids 465 - 640 ) were created in vector pET28a ( Novagen ) . The histidine - tagged recombinant protein was expressed in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells . Puriﬁed recombinant proteins were used to immunize a rabbit . Serums were affinity puriﬁed against recombinant proteins on a CNBr - activated Sepharose 4B column . Immunoprecipitation was performed by a standard method . Immunocytochemistry and FISH analysis Immunoﬂuorescent staining of whole cells was performed as described previously ( Fukagawa et al . , 1999a ) . Anti - a - tubulin and g - tubulin monoclonal antibody ( Sigma ) , rabbit anti - chicken CENP - A antibody ( Fukagawa et al . , 2001 ) ( Regnier et al . , 2003 ) , rabbit anti - chicken CENP - C antibody ( Fukagawa et al . , 1999a ) , rabbit anti - chicken CENP - H antibody ( Fukagawa et al . , 2001 ) , rabbit anti - chicken Nuf2 antibody or rabbit anti - chicken Hec1 antibody were used . Metaphase chromosome spreads for immunoﬂuorescence staining were prepared by a method modiﬁed from Earnshaw et al . ( Earnshaw et al . , 1989 ) . Chromosome spreads were stained with rabbit anti - chicken CENP - C antibody ( Fukagawa et al . , 1999a ) or rabbit anti - chicken BubR1 ( Nishihashi et al . , 2002 ) . FISH was performed as described previously ( Fukagawa et al . , 1999b ) . All immunoﬂuorescence and ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) images were collected with a cooled CCD camera ( Photometrics Image Point ) mounted on a Zeiss Axioscope microscope with a 63 · objective ( Zeiss ) together with a ﬁlter wheel . Images were manipulated with Iplab software ( Signal Analytics ) . Fluorescence microscopy in living cells Fluorescently stained living cells were observed with an Olympus inverted microscope IX70 with an oil immersion objective lens ( PlanApo 60 · , NA = 1 . 40 ) . The DeltaVision microscope system used in this study was purchased from Applied Precision , Inc . For temperature control during microscopic observations , the system was assembled in a custom - made , temperature - controlled room ( Haraguchi et al . , 1997 ; Haraguchi et al . , 1999 ) . Time - lapse images were recorded at 2 minutes intervals with an exposure time of 0 . 2 - 0 . 3 sesonds . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) assay FRAP was performed using an Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope . Cells on glass - bottomed dishes were grown at 37 (cid:176) C on a heated stage . One sectioned area was photo - bleached four times . After 1 second , time - lapse images were collected . The average signal intensity relative to the pre - bleached image was analyzed from 20 - 30 live - cell sequences by measuring the net intensity of the bleached area minus background relative to that of the whole cells in each frame by using ImageJ version 1 . 28u ( provided by W . Rasband , National Institute of Health ; http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov . / ij / ) . Results Chicken Nuf2 and Hec1 form a complex , and this complex localizes to the centrosome during G1 and S and moves to the centromere during early G2 and mitosis We cloned and sequenced several chicken cDNAs encoding Nuf2 and Hec1 . The full - length chicken Nuf2 cDNA encodes a 469 amino acid ( aa ) polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 55 . 1 kDa , and the Hec1 cDNA encodes a 640 - aa polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 73 . 7 kDa . Chicken Nuf2 protein has 75 % amino acid sequence similarity with human Nuf2 and 49 % amino acid similarity with S . cerevisiae Nuf2p . Chicken Hec1 protein has 82 % amino acid Journal of Cell Science 116 ( 16 ) 3349 Characterization of Nuf2 - Hec1 complex in DT40 sequence similarity with human Hec1 and 48 % amino acid similarity with S . cerevisiae Ndc80p . Sequence information for the chicken Nuf2 and Hec1 genes is available in DDBJ / EMBL / NCBI under accession nos . AB098621 and AB098622 , respectively . The yeast homologues of Hec1 , Ndc80p and Nuf2p form a complex with Spc24p and Spc25p ( Janke et al . , 2001 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ; He et al . , 2001 ) . Therefore , we examined the interaction between chicken Hec1 and Nuf2 in chicken DT40 cells . We generated a DT40 cell line in which Nuf2 was replaced with Nuf2 - GFP ( called Nuf39 - 15 cells ) and a DT40 cell line in which Hec1 was replaced with Hec1 - GFP ( called Hec25 - 1 / 5 cells ) . Immunoprecipitation experiments with pre - immune IgG or anti - GFP antibody were performed on extracts from Nuf39 - 15 cells and Hec25 - 1 / 5 cells . Immune complexes were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti - Hec1 and anti - Nuf2 antibodies . We found that these proteins coprecipitate ( Fig . 1A ) . To determine the subcellular localization of these proteins , GFP and HcRed were tagged on the C termini of Nuf2 and Hec1 , respectively , and a DT40 cell line was generated in which the fused genes were expressed simultaneously ( called NufG / HecR cells ) . The fusion proteins were functional and fully suppressed the phenotypes observed in knockout cells ( data not shown ) . Nuf2 - GFP and Hec1 - HcRed signals throughout the cell cycle are shown in Fig . 1B . During interphase , Nuf2 - GFP was colocalized with Hec1 - HcRed at or near centrosomes ( Fig . 1B , column 1 ) . Colocalization of Nuf2 - GFP with Hec1 - HcRed was also observed as discrete signals during prometaphase ( Fig . 1B , column 2 ) , metaphase ( Fig . 1B , column 3 ) and anaphase ( Fig . 1B , column 4 ) . Non - overlapping GFP and HcRed signals were not observed , indicating that Nuf2 is tightly associated with Hec1 throughout the cell cycle . To examine localization of the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex in detail in DT40 cells , cells expressing Nuf2 - GFP ( Nuf39 - 15 cells ) were immunostained with anti - CENP - C or anti g - tubulin antibody . We used CENP - C as a centromere marker ( Saitoh et al . , 1992 ) and g - tubulin as a centrosome marker ( Wiese and Zheng , 1999 ) . During G1 , Nuf2 - GFP was colocalized with g - tubulin and not CENP - C ( Fig . 2A , B ) . We observed Nuf2 - GFP colocalized with CENP - C and g - tubulin during G2 after Nuf2 - GFP signals were trapped at the nuclear membrane . Nuf2 - GFP signals localized to the centromere during mitosis ( Fig . 2A , B ) . Centrosomic Nuf2 - GFP signals were strong and centromeric signals were relatively weak in early G2 when the centrosome begins to split ( Fig . 2B ) . In contrast , the intensity of centromeric Nuf2 - GFP signals increased in late G2 when the centrosome split was proceeding ; and strong Nuf2 - GFP signals were observed at centromeres during late G2 ( Fig . 2A , B ) . To conﬁrm that localization of Nuf2 - GFP changes , we examined the behavior of Nuf2 - GFP signals in individual living cells ( Fig . 2C ; Movie 1 , http : / / jcs . biologists . org / supplemental ) . We stained the chromosomes of living cells expressing Nuf2 - GFP with Hoechst 33342 and observed the cells microscopically at 37 (cid:176) C . An example of the time - lapse data is shown in Fig . 2C . The dynamic changes in Nuf2 Fig . 1 . Nuf2 associates tightly with chicken Hec1 throughout the cell cycle .

Nuclei and chromosomes are counterstained with DAPI ( blue ) . The scale bars correspond to 10 m m . As shown in the merged images , Nuf2 - GFP signals are colocalized with Hec1 - HcRed signals throughout the cell cycle . 3350 localization observed during the cell cycle in living cells were similar to those identiﬁed in ﬁxed cells . Generation of conditional loss - of - function mutants of Nuf2 and Hec1 in DT40 cells To investigate the roles of Nuf2 and Hec1 in higher vertebrate cells , we generated conditional loss - of - function mutants of Nuf2 and Hec1 . In our system , expression of both Nuf2 and Hec1 was under the control of a tetracycline ( tet ) - repressible promoter . A Nuf2 deletion construct was generated such that the 8 . 0 kb genomic fragment encoding amino acids 1 - 223 was replaced with one of several selection cassettes ( Fig . 3A ) . We initially transfected a Nuf2 disruption construct containing the Journal of Cell Science 116 ( 16 ) Fig . 2 . Dynamic localization of the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex during the cell cycle .

In the superimposed images ( lower row ) , chromosomes and Nuf2 - GFP are displayed in red and green , respectively . 3351 Characterization of Nuf2 - Hec1 complex in DT40 histidinol - resistance cassette into DT40 cells ( Fig . 3A ) and isolated Nuf2 + / – clones ( Fig . 3B ) . One Nuf2 + / – clone was cotransfected with a chicken Nuf2 transgene under the control of a tet - repressible promoter and a tet - repressible transactivator containing a zeocin - resistance cassette . We selected zeocin - resistant colonies and identiﬁed several clones carrying these constructs integrated at random sites in the genome ( Nuf2 + / – / Nuf2 transgene ) . Six clones with the Nuf2 + / – / Nuf2 transgene genotype were transfected with the puromycin - Nuf2 disruption construct to disrupt the remaining Nuf2 allele ( Fig . 3B ) . We obtained two clones with the Nuf2 – / – / Nuf2 transgene genotype , and one clone , Nuf23 - 63 , was chosen for further analysis . We used the same strategy to generate Hec1 mutants . Three Hec1 alleles are present in the chicken DT40 genome . A Hec1 deletion construct was generated such that the 4 . 0 kb genomic fragment encoding amino acids 1 - 75 was replaced with one of several selection cassettes ( Fig . 3A ) . We sequentially transfected Hec1 disruption constructs containing either the histidinol - or puromycin - resistance cassette into DT40 cells ( Fig . 3A ) . After generating clones with the Hec1 + / – / – / Hec1 transgene genotype , we transfected the neomycin - Hec1 disruption construct to delete the remaining Hec1 allele and obtained six clones with the Hec1 – / – / – / Hec1 transgene genotype ( Fig . 3B ) . One clone , Hec25 - 1 , was chosen for further analysis . Western blot analysis did not detect Nuf2 protein in Nuf23 - 63 cells 24 hours after tet addition , or Hec1 protein in Hec25 - 1 cells 12 hours after tet addition ( Fig . 3C ) . Deletion of Nuf2 and Hec1 results in accumulation of cells in prometaphase and subsequent cell death The growth curves of Nuf23 - 63 ( Nuf2 + , tet – ) and Hec25 - 1 ( Hec1 + , tet – ) cells were indistinguishable from that of wild - type DT40 cells ( Fig . 4A ) . We then examined cell proliferation and viability following the addition of tet to the medium . Nuf23 - 63 cells ( Nuf2 – , tet + ) stopped proliferating approximately 1 . 5 cell cycles after addition of tet , and most cells died by 48 hours ( Fig . 4A ) . Hec25 - 1 cells ( Hec1 – , tet + ) stopped proliferating approximately 10 hours after addition of tet , and most cells died by 36 hours ( Fig . 4A ) . These ﬁndings indicate that depletion of Nuf2 and Hec1 causes growth arrest and subsequent cell death . For cell cycle analysis following gene depletion in both knockout cells , we measured both cellular DNA content and DNA synthesis by ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) after pulse - labeling with BrdU ( Fig . 4B ) . Nuf23 - 63 cells ( tet + ) started to accumulate in the G2 / M phase 18 hours after addition of tet and 48 % of cells were in the G2 / M phase by 24 hours . Hec25 - 1 cells ( tet + ) also started to accumulate in the G2 / M phase 12 hours after addition of tet and 54 % of cells were in the G2 / M phase by 18 hours ( Fig . 4B ) . After a prolonged delay in the G2 / M phase , cells of both clones died suddenly . Degradation of chromosomal DNA due to massive cell death was observed ( Fig . 4B and Fig . 5A ) . To determine the exact nature of the mitotic delay , we used DNA staining and immunocytochemical staining of microtubules to examine the time course of events following the depletion of Nuf2 and Hec1 ( Fig . 5A , B ) . In Nuf2 - deﬁcient cells , the mitotic index began to increase at 12 hours and reached 44 % at 24 hours after addition of tet ( Fig . 5A , B ) . In Hec1 - deﬁcient cells , the mitotic index began to increase at 12 hours and reached 52 % at 18 hours after addition of tet ( Fig . 5A , B ) . We did not observe any anaphase cells after 24 hours in either mutant cell line ( Fig . 5B ) . These data suggest that both Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells accumulate in the M phase rather than in the G2 phase . Although we observed the movement of these proteins to the centromere from the centrosome , both mutant cell types displayed a terminal phenotype during mitosis . We did not detect further uptake of BrdU after cell - cycle arrest . We did not observe many polyploid cells , in contrast to CENP - H - or CENP - I - deﬁcient cells , which proceed to the next interphase after a long delay in mitosis ( Fukagawa et al . , 2001 ; Nishihashi et al . , 2002 ) . Considering the FACS data together with cytological data , we suggest that Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells died after cell - cycle arrest during mitosis . Deletion of Nuf2 or Hec1 causes chromosome aberrations and leads to chromosome missegregation . During the course of cytological analyses of Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells , we observed many abnormal mitotic cells that contained hypercondensed chromosomes that failed to congress normally to the metaphase plate ( Fig . 5A ) . Eventually , the cells underwent apoptosis ( Fig . 5A ) . In control cells , the chromosomes appeared ordered and aligned properly on the metaphase plate ( Fig . 5A ) . Control cells cultured in the absence of tet showed well - ordered bipolar spindles during both metaphase and anaphase ( Fig . 5A , 0 hours ) . In the mutant cell lines , most cells cultured in the presence of tet had normal bipolar spindles , but some contained multi - or monopolar spindles . We found , by observing living cells , that normal bipolar spindles formed just after entrance into mitosis and the abnormal spindles appeared during mitotic arrest ( Fig . 6 ; Movies 2 and 3 , http : / / jcs . biologists . org / supplemental ) . In most mutant cells with bipolar spindles , chromosome alignment was disordered . We frequently observed arch - shaped spindles away from chromosomes ( Fig . 5A ) . These results indicate that Nuf2 and Hec1 are required either directly or indirectly for congression and / or maintenance of stable chromosome alignment and , ultimately , for progression from metaphase to anaphase . We then examined whether the mitotic defects caused by depletion of Nuf2 and Hec1 were associated with induction of aneuploidy . We performed FISH analysis of metaphase spreads with chromosome painting probes speciﬁc for chicken chromosomes 1 and 2 . Because DT40 cells contain three copies of chromosome 2 , ﬁve ﬂuorescent chromosomes can be observed in each wild - type cell . As shown in Fig . 5C , we observed abnormal numbers of painted chromosomes in both Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells in the presence of tet . The proportion of these aneuploid cells increased gradually after addition of tet ( Fig . 5C ) , suggesting that deﬁciency of Nuf2 and Hec1 cause chromosome missegregation . Although Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells died in M phase , the proportion of aneuploid cells increased . We explain this observation as follows . At an early stage after addition of tet , cells have a small amount of Hec1 or Nuf2 protein . In this stage , several populations of cells can exit M phase with a small amount of Hec1 or Nuf2 . These cells may fail to complete normal mitosis , and cells with chromosome loss accumulate . To determine the consequences of Nuf2 deﬁciency in 3352 Journal of Cell Science 116 ( 16 ) Fig . 3 .

Equal amounts of extracts were separated by SDS - PAGE and analyzed by western blotting . Anti - a - tubulin antibody was used as a loading control . 3353 Characterization of Nuf2 - Hec1 complex in DT40 greater detail , we observed the dynamic behavior of individual living cells after suppression of Nuf2 expression ( Fig . 6 ; Movies 2 and 3 ) . To visualize microtubules in living cells , the human a - tubulin gene fused with GFP was integrated into the genome of Nuf23 - 63 cells . We then stained the live Nuf23 - 63 cells expressing GFP - a - tubulin with Hoechst 33342 and observed the cells microscopically at 37 (cid:176) C . Representative time - lapse data for Nuf23 - 63 cells in the absence of tet ( control ) are shown in Fig . 6A . Control cells ( n = 10 ) required approximately 30 minutes to progress from prophase to telophase . After addition of tet to Nuf23 - 63 cells , we observed abnormal mitotic behavior ( Fig . 6B ) . We observed normal progression during interphase and a normal split of centrosomes ( data not shown ) . Time point 0 in Fig . 6B corresponds to 18 hours after addition of tet to cultures of Nuf23 - 63 cells . The cell shown in Fig . 6B entered mitosis ( 20 minutes ) as condensed individual chromosomes appeared and the mitotic spindle formed . Chromosome congression to the metaphase plate and subsequent anaphase were not observed . Instead , the cell remained arrested in prometaphase for approximately 400 minutes with hyper - condensed chromosomes . During this prolonged mitotic arrest , the spindle structure underwent a series of abnormal changes . Early after mitotic entry ( Fig . 6B , 16 - 20 minutes ) a normal - looking bipolar mitotic spindle had formed , but subsequently an abnormal spindle formed ( Fig . 6B , 126 - 304 minutes ) . After prolonged mitotic arrest , the cell underwent apoptosis . Similar events were observed in Hec1 mutant cells ( data not shown ) . The time of mitotic arrest in Nuf2 and Hec1 mutants ( approximately 400 minutes ) was shorter than that observed B A 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 10 - 1 10 - 2 0 12 24 36 48 60 72 Time ( h ) Wt DT40 ( tet - ) Nuf23 - 63 Nuf2 + , ( tet - ) Hec25 - 1 Hec1 + , ( tet - ) Hec25 - 1 Hec1 - , ( tet + ) Nuf23 - 63 Nuf2 - , ( tet + ) Wt DT40 ( tet + ) Nuf23 - 63 , + tet Hec25 - 1 , + tet 0 h 6 h 12 h 18 h 24 h 36 h 48 h 0 h 6 h 12 h 18 h 24 h 36 h 48 h 17 18 60 59 20 16 56 20 17 47 32 13 48 22 14 3 38 16 58 17 17 56 17 11 B r d U up t a k e DNA content 45 34 12 54 4 28 R e l a t i v e c e ll nu m be r Fig . 4 .

Arrows indicate misaligned chromosomes at the metaphase plate . Apoptotic cells were observed in both mutants 48 hours after addition of tet .

We scored the number of interphase cells , normal metaphase cells , aberrant metaphase cells , anaphase cells and apoptotic cells . Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL assay . We scored approximately 3000 cells for each time point . ( C ) To examine chromosome loss , we used FISH analysis with chromosome - speciﬁc painting probes . We used painting probes for chicken chromosomes 1 and 2 . Because DT40 cells have three copies of chromosome 2 , ﬁve painted chromosomes were observed in normal cells . Nuf23 - 63 and Hec25 - 1 cells were cultured after addition of tet . At the indicated times cells were treated with colcemid for 1 . 5 hours , and the number of painted chromosomes per cell was determined . The number of painted chromosomes was scored in approximately 1000 metaphase cells . Fig . 6 . Chromosome and microtubule dynamics in Nuf2 - deﬁcient cells .

Localization of centromere - and checkpoint - related proteins in Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells We observed that Nuf2 and Hec1 formed a complex that was maintained throughout the cell cycle ( Fig . 1 ) . Therefore , we investigated Hec1 localization in Nuf2 - deﬁcient cells and vice versa . We used a Nuf2 - deﬁcient cell line that stably expresses Hec1 - GFP and a Hec1 - deﬁcient cell line that stably expresses Nuf2 - GFP . We found that in Nuf2 - deﬁcient cells the Hec1 - GFP signals were diffuse at both centrosomes and centromeres . Nuf2 - GFP signals were diffuse in Hec1 - deﬁcient cells ( Fig . 7A ) . We also found by western blot analysis that the levels of Hec1 in Nuf2 - deﬁcient cells and of Nuf2 in Hec1 - deﬁcient cells were reduced ( Fig . 7A ) . These ﬁndings support our conclusion that the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex is tight during the cell cycle . In the present study , we found that the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex localizes to the centromere during mitosis . We reported previously that centromere components were not assembled in a simple linear fashion ( Nishihashi et al . , 2002 ) . Therefore , we examined whether inner centromere proteins localize to the centromere in Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells . Metaphase spreads of Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells were analyzed with antibodies against chicken CENP - A , - C , and - H , which are typical inner centromere proteins . Representative results are shown in Fig . 7B . In Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells , strong centromeric signals for CENP - A - C , and - H were observed , and the signal intensities were similar to those in control cells ( Fig . 7B ) . These results indicate that Nuf2 and Hec1 do not inﬂuence localization of CENP - A , - C , and - H in mitotic chromosomes . We observed mitotic arrest in Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells ( Figs 4 , 5 and 6 ) . This phenotype could be due to activation of a mitotic checkpoint ( Wassmann and Benezra , 2001 ) . We analyzed localization of a checkpoint protein , Mad2 , in Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells ( Fig . 7C ) . We used a Nuf2 - deﬁcient cell line that stably expressed Mad2 - DsRed ( Sonoda et al . , 2001 ) and a Hec1 - deﬁcient cell line that stably expressed Mad2 - DsRed . In both Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells we did not detect Mad2 - DsRed signals at centromeres that we can detect easily in control cells ( Fig . 7C ) . Because both mutants are clearly arrested in mitosis for 400 minutes before dying , we analyzed the localization of BubR1 , which is another checkpoint protein ( Chan et al . , 1999 ) . We found strong BubR1 signals in mitotically arrested Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells ( Fig . 7C ) . These results suggest that the mitotic arrest in both mutants is due to activation of the BubR1 pathway . We have shown that the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex is localized at centrosomes during the G1 and S phases ( Fig . 2 ) . Thus , we investigated localization of g - tubulin in Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells during these phases , because the ring complex with g - tubulin is a major component of centrosomes ( Wiese and Zheng , 1999 ) . We stained Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells with an antibody against g - tubulin . We detected typical centrosome signals for g - tubulin in both control and mutant cells ( Fig . 7D ) , suggesting that the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex is localized in the pericentriolar material away from the g - tubulin complex . Nuf2 and Hec1 localization in cells with disruption of the inner centromere structure Immunocytochemical analysis of Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells with inner centromere proteins CENP - A , - C and - H revealed that Nuf2 and Hec1 are not necessary for localization of the inner centromere proteins to the centromere ( Fig . 7B ) . Therefore , we examined whether Nuf2 and Hec1 are targeted to centromeres lacking the inner centromere proteins . We reported previously that BubR1 , a checkpoint protein in the outer centromere , is targeted to disrupted centromeres in CENP - I knockout cells ( Nishihashi et al . , 2002 ) . We used CENP - H - deﬁcient cells that stably expressed Nuf2 - GFP or Hec1 - GFP . We also used CENP - I - deﬁcient cells that stably expressed Nuf2 - GFP or Hec1 - GFP . We did not detect CENP - H or CENP - I signals in CENP - H - or CENP - I - deﬁcient cell lines , respectively , 48 hours after addition of tet . Typical results are shown in Fig . 8 . Nuf2 - GFP and Hec1 - GFP signals are signiﬁcantly lower in both CENP - H - and CENP - I - deﬁcient cells in comparison to control cells . However , we can still observe signals for Nuf2 and Hec1 . These results suggest that association of Nuf2 or Hec1 with centromeres was weak in CENP - H - and CENP - I - deﬁcient cells . Nuf2 and Hec1 turn over rapidly at centrosomes and are stably associated with centromeres . In the present study , we observed the dynamic behavior of the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex during the cell cycle . To gain insight into the dynamics of Nuf2 and Hec1 in living cells , we used Nuf39 - 15 cells in which expression of Nuf2 is completely replaced with Nuf2 - GFP and Hec25 - 1 / 5 cells in which expression of Hec1 is completely replaced with Hec1 - GFP ( described in Fig . 1A ) . Growth of these cell lines was identical to that of wild - type DT40 cells , which indicates that Nuf2 - GFP and Hec1 - GFP were functional . We used ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) of these cells to assay the turnover of these proteins at centrosomes ( during G1 or S phase ) and at centromeres ( during mitosis ) . We found that Nuf2 - GFP and Hec1 - GFP ﬂuorescence at centrosomes recovered rapidly ( Fig . Fig . 7 . Localization of centromere - and checkpoint - related proteins in Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells . ( A ) Localization analysis of Hec1 - GFP in Nuf2 - deﬁcient cells and Nuf2 - GFP in Hec1 - deﬁcient cells . In control cells ( – tet ) , Hec1 - GFP ( green ) and Nuf2 - GFP ( green ) signals are localized at the centrosome ( G1 / S phase ) and centromere ( mitosis ) . After addition of tet , both signals are reduced . DNA is counterstained with DAPI ( blue ) . The panel on the right shows a western blot analysis with a mixture of anti - Nuf2 and anti - Hec1 antibodies of Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells . The levels of Hec1 in Nuf2 - deﬁcient cells and of Nuf2 in Hec1 - deﬁcient cells are reduced .

( C ) Localization of checkpoint proteins in Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells . Both control cells ( - tet ) have strong Mad2 - DsRed signals . After addition of tet , the Mad2 - DsRed signals are diffuse in both mutants . Both mutants were also stained with anti - BubR1 ( red ) in the presence or absence of tet . BubR1 signals are present on the centromeres of cells in mitotic arrest caused by Nuf2 or Hec1 depletion . ( D ) Immunoﬂuorescence analysis with antibody against g - tubulin of Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells . 3358 9 ; Movies 4 and 5 , http : / / jcs . biologists . org / supplemental ) with half - times of 11 . 9 seconds ( n = 19 ) and 13 . 2 seconds ( n = 19 ) , respectively . In contrast , ﬂuorescent signals for both Nuf2 - GFP and Hec1 - GFP at centromeres did not recover rapidly ( Fig . 9 ; Movies 6 and 7 ) ; it took more than 30 minutes to recover these signals . We did not observe substantial recovery of either GFP signal when the centromere fractions of both cell lines were photobleached during early mitosis . These ﬁndings indicate that the associations of Nuf2 and Hec1 with centrosomes during G1 and S phases are dynamic , and Nuf2 and Hec1 are stable components of centromeres during mitosis ( Fig . 10 ) . Discussion Dynamic localization of conserved Nuf2 - Hec1 complex during the cell cycle In the present study , we characterized the conserved Nuf2 - Hec1 protein complex in chicken DT40 cells . Several groups reported independently that Nuf2p associates with Ndc80p , Spc24p and Spc25p at centromeres in S . cerevisiae ( Janke et al . , 2001 ; Wigge and Kilmartin , 2001 ; He et al . , 2001 ) . Other groups have characterized this complex in S . pombe or C . elegans ( Nabetani et al . , 2001 ; Howe et al . , 2001 ) . Recently , the human counterpart of Ndc80p , Hec1 , and human Nuf2 were analyzed by RNAi experiments ( Martin - Lluesma et al . , 2002 ; DeLuca et al . , 2002 ) . In the present study , we showed that Nuf2 forms a complex with Hec1 in DT40 cells , and we detailed localization of this complex during the cell cycle . We studied a cell line that expressed Nuf2 - GFP and Hec1 - HcRed simultaneously and found that these proteins always colocalize . The changing localization of this complex during the cell cycle is interesting . During G1 and S phases , the complex associates with centrosomes . During G2 phase , the complex moves through the nuclear membrane and localized with interphase centromeres . During mitosis the complex is localized primarily with centromeres , although we observed small amounts of this complex at the spindle poles . There have been reports of other proteins whose localization changes during the cell cycle . Many of the mitotic checkpoint proteins and regulators of the anaphase promoting complex / cyclosome ( APC / C ) , including Cdc20 and Bub and Mad family proteins , move to kinetochores from other locations during mitosis ( Chen et al . , 1996 ; Li et al . , 1997 ; Kallio et al . , 1998 ; Taylor et al . , 1998 ) . Kinetochore localization of these proteins is correlated with progression of mitosis . When checkpoint proteins leave the kinetochores , mitosis proceeds normally . It is possible that the dynamic localization of the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex is associated with regulation of cell cycle progression . The time of Nuf2 - Hec1 complex movement to centromeres is earlier than that of the Bub and Mad family , and the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex localizes to the nuclear membrane before targeting to interphase centromeres . This changing pattern of localization Journal of Cell Science 116 ( 16 ) Fig . 8 . Nuf2 and Hec1 localization in CENP - H - and CENP - I - deﬁcient cells . ( A ) Localization of Nuf2 - GFP and Hec1 - GFP in # 5 - 5 ( D / CENP - H , CENP - H transgene ) cells grown in the absence ( – tet ) or presence ( + tet ) of tet for 48 hours .

Hec1 - GFP ( green ) or Nuf2 - GFP ( green ) signals are reduced after addition of tet ( + tet ) . 3359 Characterization of Nuf2 - Hec1 complex in DT40 of the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex differs from that observed for checkpoint proteins , which do not localize to interphase centromeres but instead localize to kinetochores after the nuclear envelope break down . The different localization patterns of the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex and checkpoint proteins suggest that the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex may not be directly involved in the spindle checkpoint machinery . As will be seen below , the knockout phenotype and FRAP analysis of the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex suggest that this complex has a novel role in regulation of the cell cycle . The Nuf2 - Hec1 complex is required for centromere function during mitosis To further our understanding of the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex , we generated conditional loss - of - function mutants of Nuf2 and Hec1 in the hyper - recombinogenic chicken DT40 cell line . We previously created several conditional mutants of the inner centromere components CENP - C , - H and - I ( Fukagawa and Brown , 1997 ; Fukagawa et al . , 1999a ; Fukagawa et al . , 2001 ; Nishihashi et al . , 2002 ) . We then compared the phenotypes of the Nuf2 and Hec1 mutants with those of the CENP mutants . Fig . 9 . Turnover of Nuf2 - GFP and Hec1 - GFP at centrosomes and centromeres . ( A ) The centrosomes and centromeres ( white boxes ) were targeted for laser photobleaching and then followed by ﬂuorescence time - lapse microscopy . Pre - bleach , post - bleach , and recovery images are shown . See Movies 4 - 7 ( http : / / jcs . biologists . org / supplemental ) . ( B ) Graphs illustrating the ratio of relative ﬂuorescence recovery . For centrosome analysis , we used Origin software ( OriginLab Corp . ) to determine recovery half - times . 3360 Despite the dynamic localization of the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex during the cell cycle , both Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells arrested speciﬁcally in prometaphase . Both mutants have hypercondensed chromosomes and abnormal spindle structures associated with prometaphase arrest . This phenotype with the accompanying abnormal mitosis is similar to those observed in CENP - C , - H , and - I mutants . Like CENP - C - , - H - and - I - deﬁcient cells , Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells fail to align their chromosomes at the spindle equator . We observed by FRAP analysis that the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex associates stably with the centromere ( Fig . 9 ) . We also used this technique to analyze turnover of CENP - H - GFP . The kinetics of turnover CENP - H - GFP and Hec1 - GFP at the centromere were similar ( T . F . , unpublished ) . FRAP analysis of Mad2 - GFP and Cdc20 - GFP at the centromere revealed that turnover of these transient kinetochore proteins is rapid ( Howell et al . , 2000 ; Kallio et al . , 2002 ) . The association of Nuf2 and Hec1 with the centromere is more stable than that of checkpoint regulators such as Mad2 and Cdc20 . Thus , we suggest that the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex is a structural component of functional centromeres and essential for full centromere function . Although we found similarities between the phenotypes of Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcent cells and inner centromere protein knockouts , we also found differences . The living - cell analysis revealed that the length of time that Nuf2 - deﬁcient cells remained in prometaphase arrest is different from that observed in CENP - H - or CENP - I - deﬁcient cells . Nuf2 - deﬁcient cells arrested for 400 minutes in prometaphase before undergoing apoptosis . In contrast , after an 800 - minute delay in mitosis , CENP - I - deﬁcient cells proceeded to the next cell cycle without normal cell division and then died . We reported previously that the lengthy delays in prometaphase observed in CENP - I - deﬁcient cells were caused by disruption of the inner kinetochore structure ( Nishihashi et al . , 2002 ) . In the present study , we showed that localization of inner centromere proteins was not altered in Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells ( Fig . 7 ) , suggesting that the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex is not involved in the inner kinetochore structure . Nevertheless , we found that Nuf2 or Hec1 depletion yielded more severe mitotic phenotypes than did depletion of CENP - C , - H , or - I . One explanation for this phenotype difference is that the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex functions not only as a simple structural component of the centromeres but also as a regulator for progression of mitosis . The mitotic delay phenotype could be due to activation of mitotic checkpoints ; however , we did not observe Mad2 localization in Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells . Martin - Lluesma et al . ( Martin - Lluesma et al . , 2002 ) showed by yeast two - hybrid analysis that human Hec1 interacts with Mad1 , and they also showed that Mad2 and Mps1 signals were reduced by Hec1 RNAi in HeLa cells . DeLuca et al . ( DeLuca et al . , 2002 ) observed mitotic arrest in human Nuf2 RNAi experiments , and they detected Mad2 signals on mitotically arrested chromosomes . In our system , we did not detect Mad2 signals on arrested chromosomes in either Hec1 - or Nuf2 - deﬁcient cells . However , we detected strong BubR1 signals at centromeres in both Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells , which suggests that mitotic arrest in both Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells is caused by activation of the BubR1 pathway . Hec1 - RNAi cells still underwent a Mad2 - dependent checkpoint arrest , even though they lacked Mad2 at kinetochores ( Martin - Lluesma et al . , 2002 ) . Therefore , it is possible that the Mad2 pathway is still active in our Nuf2 - and Hec1 - deﬁcient cells even though we cannot detect Mad2 signals . We reported previously that the outer centromere protein BubR1 recognizes the centromere even if the inner centromere structure is disrupted due to CENP - H or CENP - I depletion , and we proposed that the kinetochore is not assembled through a simple linear pathway ( Nishihashi et al . , 2002 ) . In CENP - H - and - I - deﬁcient cells , Nuf2 and Hec1 signal intensities are reduced , although signals are still visible . These results indicate that centromere localization of Nuf2 and Hec1 is in part dependent on inner centromere structure . What is the role of the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex at centrosomes ? Although we clariﬁed the important role of the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex during mitosis , the role of this complex during interphase remained unclear . The Nuf2 complex is localized primarily at centrosomes during G1 and S phases , and we found by FRAP analysis that association of the complex with centrosomes is dynamic . This dynamic behavior suggests that this complex may not be a simple structural component of centrosomes and may function as a signal transmitter to components localized at centrosomes . It is also possible that the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex is modiﬁed at centrosomes and that the localization changes depending on progression of the cell cycle . One possible modiﬁcation is phosphorylation . Cheeseman et al . ( Cheeseman et al . , 2002 ) demonstrated that the yeast homologue of Hec1 , Ndc80p , is phosphorylated by the aurora kinase Ipl1p . There are several counterparts of aurora kinase in vertebrate cells ( Adams et al . , 2001 ) . Aurora A localizes to centrosomes , and aurora B is targeted to centromeres during mitosis . It is important to determine whether the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex in vertebrate cells is phosphorylated by aurora kinases . We do not have any direct evidence for the functions of Nuf2 and Hec1 at centrosomes , and there is a possibility that neither protein has a signiﬁcant function at centrosomes . Before moving to the centromere from the centrosome , the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex is trapped at the nuclear membrane ( Fig .

Dynamic behavior of the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex during the cell cycle . Illustration of the dynamic behavior of the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex during the cell cycle . Association of the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex with centrosomes is dynamic during G1 and S phases . The complex moves through the nuclear membrane to centromeres during G2 and mitosis . Association of the complex with centromeres is stable . In the centromere , the complex provides a place for the Mad2 complex to attach to the kinetochore . 3361 Characterization of Nuf2 - Hec1 complex in DT40 2 ) . It has been reported that some components of the nuclear pore redistribute in part to the kinetochore during mitosis in mammalian cells ( Belgareh et al . , 2001 ) . The signiﬁcance of this observation is unclear ; however , it is possible that the Nuf2 - Hec1 complex is involved in recruitment of nuclear pore components to the centromere .
