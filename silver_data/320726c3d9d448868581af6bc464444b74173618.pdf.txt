Entrepreneurs ’ achieved success : developing a multi - faceted measure Dominika Wach 1 & Ute Stephan 2 & Marjan , J . Gorgievski 3 & Jürgen Wegge 1 # Springer Science + Business Media , LLC , part of Springer Nature 2018 Abstract Firm performance is typically measured via objective financial indicators . However , researchers increasingly acknowledge that entrepreneurs do not measure their success solely in financial terms but that a range of often subjective indicators matter to them . This article contributes to the debate on entrepreneurial performance by studying how entrepreneurs assess their achieved success . ‘ Entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ was conceptualized as a multi - faceted construct that includes entrepreneurs ’ self - reported achievement of firm performance , workplace relationships , personal fulfilment , community impact , and personal financial rewards . It was measured via the Subjective Entrepreneurial Success – Achievement Scale ( SES - AS ) . Over the course of three studies ( N = 390 ) the factorial structure of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ was established and largely replicated in two cultures . Based on a nomological network , we documented relationships among ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ , quasi - objective indicators of firm performance , and entrepreneurs ’ financial satisfac - tion , creativity , and health . Based on our research , we propose a new conceptual framework to study performance in the context of entrepreneurship . This framework acknowledges both the success criteria that entrepreneurs wish to achieve and those that they actually achieve , and extends our understanding of firm performance .

This interest is based on the observation that entrepre - neurs ’ decisions cannot be explained solely by reference to economic firm performance indicators . Their actions are also driven by goals and values that go beyond economic returns ( Fagenson 1993 ; Gorgievski et al . 2011 ; Wach et al . 2016 ) . For instance , entrepreneurs abandon successful firms when their own personal goals are not met ( Bates 2005 ) . Conversely , entrepreneurs persevere with objectively underperforming firms if they are highly committed to the firm ( DeTienne et al . 2008 ) . Such evidence suggests that entrepreneurs ’ subjective assessment of their success is important for the firm ’ s future existence ( Gimeno et al . 1997 ; Reijonen and Komppula 2007 ) . This raises the question of how entrepreneurs assess their own success , and how such assessments can be measured and integrated into organizational research on firm performance . Entrepreneurship researchers typically define and measure entrepreneurial perfor - mance via firm - related outcomes such as survival ( Reynolds 1987 ) , return on assets and sales , sales growth ( Dess and Robinson 1984 ) , growth in market share ( Chandler and Jansen 1992 ) , and the number of employees ( Schutjens and Wever 2000 ) . This economic approach to entrepreneurial success has received much criticism because subjective entrepreneurial success cannot be equated simply with firm performance ( Sarasvathy et al . 2013 ) . The focus on firm - related performance indicators is in line with the economic view of entrepreneurs as being individuals who are rewarded with high monetary returns for bearing high levels of risk ( Parker 2009 ) . Yet economic research increasingly acknowl - edges that entrepreneurs may seek different types of utility , such as independence and satisfaction , over and above monetary returns ( Van Praag and Versloot 2007 ; Walker and Brown 2004 ) . Psychologically - based approaches argue that , just as for other individuals , entrepreneurs are likely to pursue a range of different goals through their work , and will consequently judge their performance against these goals , which become their success criteria ( Wach et al . 2016 ) . Self - actualization , independence , autonomy , enhanced status , and social contribution ( Seelos and Mair 2005 ; Stephan et al . 2015 ) , and personal learning , fulfilment , and work - life balance ( Jayawarna et al . 2011 ) are some possible examples of entrepreneurs ’ success criteria proposed in the literature . There is some evidence that entrepreneurs value and strive for multiple success criteria simultaneously . For instance , Gorgievski et al . ( 2011 ) identified the person - oriented and business - oriented dimensions that underlie entrepreneurs ’ perceptions of their success . Similarly , Fisher et al . ( 2014 ) introduced several personal and business performance criteria to capture subjective entrepreneurial success . Recently , Wach et al . ( 2016 ) showed that entrepreneurs define their success by measures that go beyond financial rewards but also incorporate workplace relationships , the level of personal fulfilment , and community impact . While this research offers a useful starting point by highlighting the fact that entrepreneurs value multiple success criteria simultaneously , research is still lacking as to how entrepreneurs assess their success ; particularly concerning the criteria they use to determine whether they have achieved ‘ success ’ and how these criteria are structured ( i . e . how they relate to each other ) . Int Entrep Manag J ( 2020 ) 16 : 1123 – 1151 1124 To address this important question , we define entrepreneurs ’ assessment of success in terms of goal achievement . According to Schulz and Heckhausen ( 1996 ) , goal achievement is a subjective and individualized concept referring to the B realization of desired outcomes and the avoidance of undesired outcomes ^ ( p . 704 ) . As values are motivational goals that guide attitudes and behaviours ( Fischer and Boer 2016 ) , one may argue that the success criteria valued by entrepreneurs are equivalent to those they use in assessing their actual achievements . However , as discussed in more detail below , empirical evidence suggests that the link between values and behaviours can be complex . The extent to which values are expressed in behaviours depends on the type of value being considered , as well as other contextual factors such as economic resources ( Fischer 2006 ) . Thus , even though prior research offers insights on valued success criteria , it is not clear whether entrepreneurs measure their achievements against the same metrics . This is where our study aims to advance research on entrepreneurial performance . First , we introduce the concept of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ which - to our knowledge - has not yet been systematically studied . We also develop a new diagnostic tool that measures ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ . Second , we explore the underly - ing structure and test the cross - cultural equivalence of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved suc - cess ’ . A third goal of our research is to provide evidence for the construct validity of the new scale , thereby addressing the association between valued and actual achieved success criteria , and their conceptual distinctiveness . Theoretical background Within entrepreneurship research , performance has been conceptualized and measured in different ways , whether it is across broad categories , or via subjective measures of entrepreneurs ’ satisfaction with their performance , or by measuring firm performance in relation to that of competitors ( Chandler and Hanks 1993 ) . Broad categories are anchored to objective success indicators , and typically include entrepreneurs ’ earnings , firm sales , return on investment ( ROI ) , cash flow , market share , as well as changes in these parameters . In contrast , subjective measures of entrepreneurs ’ satisfaction refer to entrepreneurs ’ self - reported overall evaluation of how well their firms are performing and their degree of satisfaction with this performance ( Chandler and Hanks 1993 ) . Alternatively , entrepreneurs are asked to compare the performance of their firm to that of a rival ( Lumpkin and Dess 2001 ; Powell and Eddleston 2008 ) , or to the perfor - mances of leading firms in their market ( Gupta and Govindarajan 1986 ) . It is our contention that firm - related performance is not the only criterion against which entrepreneurs assess their success . Past research on entrepreneurial motives and goals collectively suggests that entrepreneurs view success broadly ; they value aspects that go far beyond firm performance and monetary rewards . Entrepreneurs have been found , for example , to attach importance to autonomy and independence ( Curtin and Reynolds 2008 ; Jayawarna et al . 2011 ) , self - realization and personal development ( Benzing and Chu 2009 ; Jayawarna et al . 2011 ) , achievement ( Curtin and Reynolds 2008 ; Edelman et al . 2010 ) , monetary incentives , status and social recognition ( Benzing and Chu 2009 ) , personal and family security ( Kuratko et al . 1997 ; Robichaud et al . 2001 ) , relationships with employees and stakeholders ( Gorgievski Int Entrep Manag J ( 2020 ) 16 : 1123 – 1151 1125 et al . 2011 ; Jayawarna et al . 2011 ) , creating social value and helping others ( Lukes and Stephan 2012 ; Stephan et al . 2015 ) , and spirituality ( Kauanui et al . 2010 ) . Several studies have investigated the underlying structure of the success criteria that are valued by entrepreneurs . For instance , Orser and Dyke ( 2009 ) extracted four underlying facets to capture success criteria relevant for entrepreneurs : market accep - tance ; professional autonomy ; work - life balance ; and financial indicators . Their conceptualization differs from that of Gorgievski et al . ( 2011 ) who proposed a two - dimensional model of valued success criteria , including dimensions that were person - oriented ( e . g . , personal satisfaction ) and business - oriented ( e . g . , profitability , innova - tion ) . They found that entrepreneurs perceived themselves to be successful if they achieved personal targets ( e . g . , satisfaction with life and business ) and business performance objectives ( e . g . , a continually growing business ) . Wach et al . ( 2016 ) found evidence for a more comprehensive , five - dimensional conceptualization of entrepre - neurial success composed of firm performance , workplace relationships , personal fulfilment , community impact , and personal financial rewards . Recently , Staniewski and Awruk ( 2017 ) have developed a Questionnaire of Entrepreneurial Success ( QES ) , which differentiates subjective and objective short - and long - term success perspectives . Past research on entrepreneurs ’ motives and goals , as well as research on the importance attached to different success criteria , offers an important starting point for the current research . However , none of these prior studies focused explicitly on entrepreneurs ’ subjective assessment of their achieved success . This is problematic , because the value that entrepreneurs attach to multiple success criteria differs conceptually from how entre - preneurs assess the success that they have actually achieved . While the first concept refers to entrepreneurs ’ internal representations of desired outcomes , the latter captures the actual attainment of those standards through behaviours ( i . e . goal achievement ) . We know from extant research on the ( in ) congruence of values with expression in attitudes and behaviours ( Fischer and Boer 2016 ) that the link between valued and actually achieved success criteria can be quite complex . Whether values find their expression in behaviour varies depending on the economic , ecological and institutional contexts ; for instance , in resource - rich environments or environments with strong societal norms , values are more likely to guide behaviours ( Fischer 2006 ; Fischer and Boer 2016 ) . Furthermore , diminishing marginal utility ( Maseland and van Hoorn 2009 ) explicates that the value assigned to the realization of a given goal decreases with satiation ( the growing achievement of this goal ) . Diminishing marginal utility helps to explain why Wach et al . ( 2016 ) found that entrepre - neurs highly valued monetary rewards when they earned low incomes and were dissatisfied with their financial situation . The aim of this research is to provide a new conceptualization and measurement instrument of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ to fill the research gap delineated above . In Study 1 we intend to establish that ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ consists of five separate facets ( indicators ) that are similar to the facets of desired success valued by entrepreneurs as established by Wach et al . ( 2016 ) . These five facets are firm performance , workplace relationships , personal fulfilment , community impact , and personal financial rewards . Study 2 then seeks to provide a cross - cultural replication of the five - facet conceptualization of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ . In Study 3 , we establish a nomo - logical network of relationships between the five facets of success and other constructs , such as matching economic measures of firm performance , entrepreneurs ’ creativity , and health . We also establish novel evidence on the relationships between the success criteria Int Entrep Manag J ( 2020 ) 16 : 1123 – 1151 1126 that entrepreneurs value and desire , and those that they feel they achieve . Based on prior research on valued and achieved goals ( reviewed above ) , it is unclear how these concepts may overlap . Our approach allows us to validate the five facets of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ and the instrument developed for their measurement , i . e . the Subjective Entrepre - neurial Success – Achievement Scale ( SES - AS ) . In the following section , we derive the specific hypotheses that are tested in the three studies . We then report the results of the three studies and conclude with an overall discussion . Overview of study 1 : The factorial structure of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ To conceptualize and measure ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved auccess ’ we build on the work of Wach et al . ( 2016 ) who developed and validated the ‘ Subjective Entrepreneurial Success - Importance Scale ’ ( SES - IS ) , capturing five separate success criteria that are valued by entrepreneurs . Thus , our research suggests that separate aspects of performance exist , as opposed to one abstract and generalized factor of success . Such a multi - faceted view of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ follows the recommendation of Miller et al . ( 2013 ) to adapt a so - called ‘ separate constructs approach ’ . This approach reflects not only in our theoretical conceptualization but also in our development of a new diagnostic tool to measure ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ across multiple separate indicators . In doing so , we aim to overcome the mismatch between theory development and measurement of success . That is to say , in the literature to date , there is recognition of a variety of indicators that capture diverse aspects of firm performance , but there is no consistent conceptualiza - tion of firm performance ( Miller et al . 2013 ) . Our use of the ‘ separate constructs approach ’ in developing a theory and measuring success challenges the current research tradition that typically conceptualizes performance as a single global factor while only sparsely measur - ing narrower success indicators ( Miller et al . 2013 ) . The first facet of success , firm performance , includes firm profitability , turnover and sales , as well as growth in profit and increased market share . These success criteria have been frequently utilised in entrepreneurship research and have even been equated with entrepreneurial success ( Gorgievski et al . 2011 ; Lumpkin and Dess 2001 ; Sydler et al . 2014 ) . The second facet , workplace relationships , refers to relationships with customers and employees as well as to employee satisfaction ( Harter et al . 2002 ; Payne and Joyner 2006 ; Wach et al . 2016 ) . The third facet of success , personal fulfilment , is composed of work - life balance ( Eddleston and Powell 2012 ) , work flexibility ( Vandello et al . 2013 ) , own decision making ( Busenitz and Barney 1997 ; Gorgievski et al . 2011 ) , and personal development ( St - Jean and Audet 2012 ) . These apparently diverse criteria belong together since they all represent interdependent non - pecuniary benefits . It is likely that an entrepreneur who has high decision - making authority manages his or her time more flexibly , which in turn increases work - life balance and provides opportunities for further personal development . The fourth facet of success , community impact , is associated with contributing to society ( Brammer et al . 2007 ) , managing an environmentally sustainable company ( York and Venkataraman 2010 ) and taking care of employees ( Payne and Joyner 2006 ; Wach et al . 2016 ) . Lastly , the fifth facet , personal financial rewards , includes personal income growth ( Gorgievski et al . 2011 ; Harada 2003 ) , experiencing financial security ( Kuratko et al . 1997 ) , and Int Entrep Manag J ( 2020 ) 16 : 1123 – 1151 1127 enjoying an abundance of disposable income ( Cassar 2007 ) . We formulated the following hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 ( H1 ) . ‘ Entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ ( as measured via the SES - AS ) consists of five facets : firm performance , workplace relationships , personal fulfilment , community impact , and personal financial rewards that demonstrate sufficient factorial validity and reliability . Overview of study 2 : Cross - cultural replication of the ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ Cross - cultural studies of entrepreneurial success are scarce . Thus , our research aims to provide evidence for the cross - cultural replicability of our five - facet conceptualization of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ using samples of German and Polish entrepre - neurs . We selected these countries because there are considerable differences between Germany and Poland in terms of cultural practices . According to the GLOBE study ( House et al . 2004 ) , Germans exhibit higher assertive - ness ( 4 . 77 in East Germany , 4 . 66 in West Germany versus 4 . 11 in Poland ) and performance orientation than do Poles ( 4 . 16 , 4 . 42 versus 3 . 96 ) ( Brodbeck et al . 2002 ) . High degrees of assertiveness and performance orientation are cultural practices that align with the firm performance and personal financial rewards facets of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ . Poles on the other hand score considerably higher on institutional and in - group collectivism than do individuals from former East and West Germany ( 4 . 51 versus 3 . 67 , 3 . 97 for institutional and 5 . 55 versus 4 . 59 , 4 . 16 for in - group collectivism ) , and these are cultural practices that align with the workplace relationships facet of success . Conversely , individ - ualism aligns with the personal fulfilment facet and is higher in Germany than in Poland while gender egalitarianism and humane orientation can be seen to align with the commu - nity impact facet of success , and are less pronounced in former East and West Germany as compared to Poland ( 3 . 17 , 3 . 25 versus 3 . 94 for gender egalitarianism and 3 . 45 , 3 . 30 versus 3 . 67 for humane orientation ) . Such differences in cultural practices between Germany and Poland suggest that we can meaningfully test the cross - cultural robustness of the five - facet conceptualization of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ in these two countries . Existing cultural differences may influence the level of achieved success but should not impact the underlying structure of the concept of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ . Therefore , we propose : Hypothesis 2 ( H2 ) . The underlying structure of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ ( as measured via the SES - AS ) can be replicated in an independent Polish sample . Overview of study 3 : Criterion validity of the ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ in German and polish samples In exploring the criterion validity of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ , we draw upon the recommendation of Miller et al . ( 2013 ) , who proposed developing the nomological network to indicate how various components of performance relate both to each Int Entrep Manag J ( 2020 ) 16 : 1123 – 1151 1128 another and to different outcomes . We thus look at the relationships between the five separate facets of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ and with other conceptually related variables . We expect the achievement of facets firm performance and personal finan - cial rewards to be positively associated with the broad - categories indicators of firm performance that are typically utilized in entrepreneurship research ( Chandler and Hanks 1993 ) . These indicators are firm pre - tax profit , firm net profit , firm revenue development , firm employee growth , and entrepreneur ’ s annual income . We also include entrepreneurs ’ satisfaction with their financial situation and their evaluation of global firm financial success because such self - ratings frequently have been utilized in past research . For instance , in their meta - analysis Rauch and Frese ( 2007 ) relate personal characteristics to such measures of entrepreneurial success . In a similar vein , Powell and Eddleston ( 2008 ) collected information on satisfaction ( i . e . satisfaction with earning a lot of money , growing a world - class business , and leading a large rapidly growing enterprise ) to capture success . We formulated the following hypotheses : Hypothesis 3 ( H3 ) . Entrepreneurs ’ achievement ( as measured via the SES - AS ) of firm performance relates positively to firm pre - tax profit , firm net profit , firm revenue development , and firm employee growth as well as to self - reported global firm financial success . Hypothesis 4 ( H4 ) . Entrepreneurs ’ achievement ( as measured via the SES - AS ) of their personal financial rewards relates positively to their self - reported annual income and satisfaction with financial situation . According to Fisher et al . ( 2014 ) , entrepreneurs perceive themselves as successful when they are satisfied with their life and business . In addition , Gorgievski et al . ( 2011 ) found personal satisfaction to be the most highly valued success criterion for entrepre - neurs , followed by profitability , and satisfied stakeholders . Based on the logic that for entrepreneurs their achievement of firm and personal success criteria is a proxy of a successful career , we expect all facets of achieved success to relate positively to self - reported career success . Thus , we formulated the following hypothesis : Hypothesis 5 ( H5 ) . Entrepreneurs ’ achievement of success ( as measured via the SES - AS ) relates positively to their self - reported career success . Creativity is an B ( … ) ability to produce work that is both novel ( i . e . original , unexpected ) and appropriate ( i . e . useful , adaptive concerning task constraints ) ^ ( Sternberg and Lubart 1999 ) ( p . 3 ) . Creativity is seen as an essential part of the entrepreneurial toolbox ( Rauch and Frese 2007 ) and is positively related to firm performance and venture growth ( Gielnik et al . 2012 ) . By reason of the link between creativity and business growth , it is also suggested that creativity positively affects communities and society in general ( Bilton 2007 ) . Some work suggests that entrepre - neurs who seek positive community , social , and environmental impacts are particularly creative ( Renko 2013 ) . Thus , we formulated following hypothesis : Hypothesis 6 ( H6 ) . Entrepreneurs ’ achievement ( as measured via the SES - AS ) of firm performance and community impact relate positively to entrepreneurs ’ self - reported creativity . Int Entrep Manag J ( 2020 ) 16 : 1123 – 1151 1129 Achieved success may also link with entrepreneurs ’ health . Entrepreneurs invest significant amounts of energy , time , and money to sustain their firms . Thus , success may boost their health and well - being , while setbacks in the business are likely to negatively impact their health and well - being . There is evidence to corroborate this . For instance , more successful entrepreneurs were found to be healthier ( Rau et al . 2008 ) , and those experiencing work - related strain assessed themselves as less personally and financially successful ( Dijkhuizen et al . 2014 ) . Equally , entrepreneurs feel stressed when they experience financial problems or when they struggle to achieve their desired level of firm performance ( i . e . growth , sales turnover , profit ) ( Grant and Ferris 2012 ) . We therefore formulated the following hypothesis : Hypothesis 7 ( H7 ) . Entrepreneurs ’ achievement ( as measured via the SES - AS ) of firm performance , personal financial rewards , and personal fulfilment relates positively to entrepreneurs ’ health . To our knowledge , no research exists on the relationship between entrepreneurs ’ valued and actual achieved success criteria . A better understanding of this relationship can help to shed a light both on entrepreneurial performance and on persistence in entrepreneurship , such as when entrepreneurs withdraw from firms that perform well ( Bates 2005 ) . It provides insight as to whether a positive link between desired and achieved entrepreneurial outcomes exists , and whether such a link applies to all facets of success . This knowledge can also increase our understanding of entrepreneurs ’ strategic decision - making and their well - being . We formulated the following explor - atory research question : Research Question 1 . How do the valued and achieved facets of success i . e . firm performance , workplace relationships , personal fulfilment , community impact , and personal financial rewards , relate to each other ? Research method As we conducted three studies in two countries , we will start with descriptions of all three samples , followed by a brief description of the measures used . German sample 1 ( used for testing H1 and to answer research question 1 ) In 2008 we recruited 184 entrepreneurs who were owner - managers of small and medium sized private firms employing a maximum of 300 employees . We sampled entrepreneurs via social networks and online platforms such as Xing , LinkedIn , AIESEC , entrepreneurs ’ associations , and chambers of commerce . We also randomly selected every 20th entry in each of the 16 German states using Yellow Pages ( Dillman 2000 ) . Participation was voluntary and anonymous . Participation rate was 11 . 55 % . Entrepreneurs filled out either an online ( 50 % of participants , n = 92 ) or a paper and pencil questionnaire . Women participated significantly more frequently in the online survey than men ( χ 2 = 27 . 57 , df = 1 , p < . 001 ) . The mean values of the five facets of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ measured via the SES - AS measurement instrument Int Entrep Manag J ( 2020 ) 16 : 1123 – 1151 1130 did not differ significantly between the two modes of data collection ( Pillai - Spur test was at p = . 26 n . s . ) . We excluded five participants with missing data , thus the total Sample 1 consisted of 179 entrepreneurs who were on average 45 . 78 years old ( SD = 9 . 72 , ranging from 22 to 72 , Mdn = 45 ) and were self - employed for an average of 12 . 69 years ( SD = 7 . 70 , ranging from 0 to 38 , Mdn = 11 . 29 ) . Only two entrepreneurs had been self - employed for less than one year . Women represented 26 . 60 % ( n = 44 ) of the whole sample . About 58 % ( n = 102 ) of the participants held a university degree and 63 % ( n = 115 ) of the entrepreneurs were firm founders . On average , firms were 24 years old ( SD = 30 . 72 , ranging from 0 to 182 , Mdn = 14 ) . Only two firms had operated on the market for less than one year , while 16 firms operated for more than 60 years . Entrepreneurs hired 22 . 37 employees ( SD = 43 . 68 , ranging from 1 to 300 , Mdn = 10 ) , of which two firms employed only one person and two firms employed 300 employees . Firms operated in building and construction ( 42 . 5 % , n = 76 ) , innovative technologies and electronics ( 18 . 4 % , n = 33 ) , services ( 26 . 3 % , n = 47 ) , and trading ( 12 . 8 % , n = 23 ) . German sample 2 ( used for testing H1 to H6 ) We collected further data in 2012 . Entrepreneurs who were owner - managers were sampled via social networks and online platforms , entrepreneurs ’ associations , and chambers of commerce . Response rate was 33 . 13 % . All participants filled out an online questionnaire . In total we sampled 115 entrepreneurs ; however , we excluded five participants due to missing data . Entrepreneurs were on average 47 . 37 years old ( SD = 9 . 68 , ranging from 27 to 74 years , Mdn = 48 ) , 82 . 10 % ( n = 87 ) were men , 39 . 10 % held a university degree ( n = 43 ) and 64 . 80 % ( n = 70 ) were firm founders . On average , the firms had operated on the market for 27 . 30 years ( SD = 29 . 00 , ranging from 1 year to 203 years , Mdn = 20 ) . Sixteen firms had existed for more than 60 years . Entrepreneurs employed 17 . 89 employees ( SD = 40 . 24 , ranging from 0 to 300 , Mdn = 7 ) ; five firms had no employees and one firm more than 250 employees . They operated in building and construction ( 13 . 60 % , n = 15 ) , trading ( 4 . 50 % , n = 5 ) , services ( 20 . 90 % , n = 23 ) , manufacturing ( 48 . 2 % , n = 53 ) , gastronomy ( 4 . 5 % , n = 5 ) , automo - bile ( 2 . 70 % , n = 3 ) , medicine ( 0 . 90 % , n = 1 ) , and production ( 4 . 50 % , n = 5 ) . Polish sample ( used for testing H1 , H2 , H7 , and research question 1 ) In 2009 , we collected data in Poland . Participants were recruited via telephone ; the response rate was 20 % . Entrepreneurs filled out either an online or paper and pencil questionnaire ( 53 % online , n = 59 ) . We did not find significant differences in mean values with regard to the five success facets ( Pillai - Spur , F = 1 . 45 , df = 5 , p = . 129 ns ) nor with regard to socio - demographic variables , which demonstrates that the results were not affected by the method of data collection . The Polish sample consisted of 101 respondents who completed the survey . Entrepreneurs were on average 38 years old ( SD = 10 . 68 , ranging from 22 to 72 , Mdn = 35 years ) , married ( 63 % , n = 66 ) , and about 67 % of them ( n = 68 ) had a university degree . Men made up 53 . 5 % ( n = 54 ) of the sample . All respondents were founders of the firms that they currently owned and managed . They employed on average 9 employees ( SD = 20 . 28 , ranging from 0 to 180 , Mdn = 3 . 5 employees ) . Twenty firms had no employees . Firms had operated at least one year on the market in the following industrial sectors : building and construction Int Entrep Manag J ( 2020 ) 16 : 1123 – 1151 1131 ( 4 % , n = 4 ) , innovative technologies and electronics ( 22 % , n = 22 ) , services ( 67 % , n = 67 ) , trading ( 4 , n = 4 ) , and transportation ( 4 % , n = 4 ) . Measures ‘ Entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ was measured via the Subjective Entrepreneurial Success - Achievement Scale ( SES - AS ) . We asked participants to indicate how success - ful they had been in the past year in achieving 17 specific success criteria representing the five separate facets of success . These were firm performance ( 4 items ) , workplace relationships ( 3 items ) , personal fulfilment ( 4 items ) , community impact ( 3 items ) , and personal financial rewards ( 3 items ) ( see Appendix Table 9 , left row ) . The answering format ranged from 1 ‘ not achieved at all ’ to 5 ‘ absolutely achieved ’ . A sample item was ‘ In the past year I achieved work - life - balance …’ All items are adapted from the SES - IS scale ( Wach et al . 2016 ) , although we changed the instruction to assess entrepreneurs ’ actual achievement of success criteria instead of the value entrepreneurs attach to these criteria . The German version of SES - AS scale was translated into Polish by a bilingual researcher and translated back again by an independent researcher . To answer Research Question 1 , we assessed entrepreneurs ’ valued success criteria using the Subjective Entrepreneurial Success - Importance Scale ( SES - IS ) ( Wach et al . 2016 ) . Entrepreneurs reported the importance to them of the following five facets of success : firm performance ( 4 items ) , workplace relationships ( 3 items ) , personal fulfilment ( 4 items ) , community impact ( 3 items ) , and personal financial rewards ( 3 items ) , using a 5 - point Likert scale going from 1 ‘ not important at all ’ to 5 ‘ absolutely important ’ . Firm - related performance indicators We collected entrepreneurs ’ reports on their firm pre - tax profit and firm net profit in the years 2009 , 2010 and 2011 . We also asked entrepreneurs to report their firm revenue development in the years 2008 to 2009 , 2009 to 2010 , and 2010 to 2011 , as well as employee growth over the last year , and their own annual income . We log - transformed theses variables to obtain a normal distribution . Entrepreneurs ’ satisfaction with their financial situation was measured using two items from the German Federal Health Survey ( Bellach et al . 1998 ) that tackled satisfaction with one ’ s personal income and with one ’ s own financial situation . The response format was a 7 - point scale using Kunin - Faces ( Kunin 1955 ) , ranging from 1 ‘ very sad , unsatisfied ’ to 7 ‘ very happy ’ . A sample item was ‘ How satisfied are you with your income ? ’ Cronbach ’ s Alpha was α = . 93 . We collected entrepreneurs ’ self - reports on global firm financial success using a single item : ‘ In general , my firm is financially very successful ’ . The response format was a 5 - point Likert scale ranging from 1 ‘ absolutely disagree ’ to 5 ‘ absolutely agree ’ . Entrepreneurs ’ self - reported career success was measured with the 6 - item career success subscale derived from an instrument measuring individual stress management and coping pattern styles ( Schaarschmidt and Fischer 2001 ) . High scores reflect a positive evaluation of one ’ s career and occupational accomplishments . The response format ranged from 1 ‘ applies absolutely ’ to 5 ‘ does not apply at all ’ . A sample item was ‘ My present professional life is fairly successful ’ . Cronbach ’ s Alpha was α = . 89 . Entrepreneurs ’ creativity was measured with 7 items based on the scale introduced by Zhou and George ( 2001 ) and refined by Baer and Oldham ( 2006 ) , with a 7 - point response Int Entrep Manag J ( 2020 ) 16 : 1123 – 1151 1132 format ranging from 1 ‘ does not apply at all ‘ to 7 ‘ applies absolutely ‘ . Cronbach ’ s Alpha was α = . 89 . A sample item was ‘ I often have new and innovative ideas ’ . Entrepreneurs ’ mental health was measured with the 7 items of the SF - 12 Health Survey ( Bullinger and Kirchberger 1998 ) , which includes areas such as social func - tioning , role limitations due to emotional problems , and mental health , as well as enquiries about the subject ’ s positive and negative emotional states . A sample item was ‘ During the past four weeks , how much of the time have your emotional problems interfered with your social activities ( like visiting friends , relatives ) ? ’ Cronbach ’ s Alpha reliability coefficient was α = . 78 . We also measured entrepreneurs ’ vital exhaustion using the shortened Maastricht Exhaustion Questionnaire ( 9 items ) ( Kopp et al . 1998 ) , which is widely used in clinical and healthy samples ( Appels and Mulder 1988 ) . The scale assessed fatigue , trouble falling asleep , waking up at night , general malaise , apathy , irritability , loss of energy , demoraliza - tion , and waking up exhausted . Answers were scored as 0 for ‘ no ’ , 1 for ‘ indeterminate ’ , and 2 for ‘ yes ’ . The total score ranged from 0 to 18 , with a score between 0 and 2 indicating not exhausted , a score between 3 and 10 suggesting moderate exhaustion , and a score above 11 indicating severe ( i . e . clinical ) exhaustion . Cronbach ’ s Alpha reliability coeffi - cient was α = . 83 . A sample item was ‘ Do you often feel tired ? ’ Socio - demographics We collected information on gender , age in years , nationality , industry sector , firm age , and number of employees currently and one year ago . Results Study 1 : The factorial structure of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ ( SES - AS ) In all three samples we tested H1 , stating that ‘ Entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ is composed of five facets , including firm performance , workplace relationships , person - al fulfilment , community impact , and personal financial rewards that demonstrate sufficient factorial validity and reliability . German sample 1 The 17 items were normally distributed ( kurtosis and skewness ranged between − 1 . 10 and . 67 ) . To test the fit of the data to the five - facet model as indicated in H1 , we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis ( CFA ) using AMOS ( Arbuckle 2014 ) ( maximum likelihood estimation ) . The hypothesized model ( M1 , Table 1 ) fitted the data fairly well ( CFI = . 896 , REMSEA = . 072 , df = 109 , χ 2 = 209 . 835 ) . Based on the examination of modification indices , we allowed 4 error terms to correlate , and the model fit increased significantly ( CFI = . 919 , REMSEA = . 068 and df = 106 , χ 2 = 192 . 720 , M1 . 1 , Table 1 ) . We also tested an alternative model M2 in which all items loaded on one single latent factor ‘ entrepre - neurs ’ achieved success ’ , and an alternative model M3 in which five success facets loaded on one second order factor ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ . Neither M2 nor M3 fitted the data better than the revised model M1 . 1 ( Table 1 ) . Int Entrep Manag J ( 2020 ) 16 : 1123 – 1151 1133 Further , in line with H1 , we examined internal consistency reliability as well as convergent and discriminant validity of the SES - AS ( Table 2 ) . Cronbach ’ s Alpha reliabilities ( α ) were above . 70 for three facets ( i . e . subscales ) but . 53 for community impact and . 65 for personal fulfilment . Composite reliability ( CR ) exceeded the recommended threshold of . 60 ( Bagozzi and Yi 1988 ) for four out of five facets ( except community impact ) , suggesting good internal consistency . All item factor loadings were well above the recommended . 40 threshold , except for the item ‘ environmentally friendly firm ’ . The average variance extracted ( AVE ) was below the recommended . 50 threshold ( Fornell and Larcker 1981 ) for the facets workplace relationships , personal fulfilment and community impact . However , CR was higher than AVE with regard to all five facets , supporting convergent validity of SES - AS ( Hair et al . 2016 ) . With regard to discriminant validity , the findings were ambiguous . On the one hand , maximum shared variance ( MSV ) was higher than AVE for all five facets . On the other hand , the average shared squared variance ( ASV ) was lower than AVE for four out of five facets ( it was not the case for community impact ) , supporting their discriminant validity ( Hair et al . 2006 ) . Although the reliability of facet community impact was rather low , in general H1 has been confirmed . German sample 2 Next , we aimed to cross - validate the SES - AS scale in the second independent German Sample 2 . To increase the Cronbach ’ s Alpha reliability of specific subscales we included additional items , i . e . item ‘ maintenance of private contacts ’ into the facet personal fulfilment , item ‘ social recognition ’ into facet community impact , as well as items ‘ strong relationships with employees ’ and ‘ employee loyalty ’ into the facet workplace relationships . Those items were derived from the qualitative Study 1 conducted by Wach et al . ( 2016 ) .

We conducted CFAwith the extended revised model and obtained moderate model fit ( M1 . 2 , Table 1 ) . Based on modification indices , we deleted four items : ‘ firm profitability ’ , ‘ strong customer relationships ’ , ‘ work - life balance ’ , and ‘ maintenance of private contacts ’ . We also moved the item ‘ social responsibility for employees ’ from facet community impact to facet workplace relationships . We believe this is theoretically defensible based on the content of the item which references the ‘ inside ’ of the company , i . e . , caring for employees rather than the ‘ outside ’ of the company as in the facet community impact . . This way , we obtained a very good fit of the final five - facet model with no error terms being correlated ( M . 1 . 3 , Table 1 , German sample 2 ) . This model is the basis for further analyses .

All item factor loadings were well above the recommended . 40 threshold , except for the item ‘ personal work flexibility ’ . Overall , the results suggest that convergent validity of the SES - AS facets was supported . The AVE was above the recommended . 50 threshold , with the exception of the facet personal fulfilment . The MSV was lower than AVE , except for the facet firm performance . The ASV was lower than AVE for all five facets . In sum , the convergent and discriminant validity of the SES - AS improved significantly in this study , supporting H1 . All scale development steps are presented in Appendix Table 9 . Polish sample In the Polish Sample , all items of the revised version of SES - AS were normally distributed except for the item ‘ strong customer relationships ’ . The underlying five - facet structure of SES - AS fitted well to the Polish data ( CFI was . 987 , REMSEA was . 031 , df = 109 , χ 2 = 119 . 473 ) ( M . 1 . 3 , Table 1 , Polish sample 3 ) . Cronbach ’ s Alpha ranged between . 67 and . 88 , CR exceeded the recommended threshold of . 60 , and CR was higher than AVE , which suggests that convergent validity of SES - AS was sup - ported . The AVE was below the recommended . 50 threshold for the facets personal fulfilment and community impact . The MSVand ASV were lower than AVE for all five Fig . 1 Factorial structure of SES - AS . Standardized factor loadings and correlations are displayed . Values in brackets refer to the Polish sample ( n = 101 ) ; other values refer to the German sample ( n = 110 ) . a indicates significant differences in factor loadings across samples ( cf . Table 3 ) . Sample difference test refers to the non - standardized loadings as standardized values are not directly comparable across samples Int Entrep Manag J ( 2020 ) 16 : 1123 – 1151 1136 facets . All item factor loadings were well above the recommended . 40 threshold ; we thus conclude that the evidence largely supported the discriminant validity of the SES - AS ( Table 2 ) . In conclusion H1 received support across three different samples : ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ consists of five facets , similar to the facets that have been established for ‘ entrepreneurs ’ valued success ’ . Study 2 : Cross - cultural replication of the ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ To test H2 , on cross - cultural robustness of the ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ operationalisation , we investigated equivalence ( i . e . invariance ) of the five - facet solu - tion of the SES - AS instrument in German sample 2 and the Polish sample . In the first step we tested configural invariance to see whether the underlying model of ‘ ntrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ fitted well across samples . The results revealed that the configural model ( unconstrained model ) fitted the data well ( M1 , Table 3 ; CFI = . 967 , RMSEA = . 037 , χ 2 = 279 . 393 , df = 218 , p < . 001 ) . In the second step we tested factor loadings invariance , which assumes that Polish and German entrepreneurs respond to the items in the same way . In other words , we tested if the strength of the factor loadings was the same across cultures . This model was tested by constraining all factor loadings to be the same across the two samples . The model fit deteriorated significantly as indicated by the chi 2 test ( χ 2 ) and delta CFI ( Δ CFI ) ( M2 , Table 3 ) . To determine the source of the lack of invariance we tested the factor loading invariance of the five facets separately , comparing them with configural model M1 . We found evidence for full invariance of the factor loadings for the facets firm performance ( M2 . 1 ) , personal financial rewards ( M2 . 5 ) , and workplace relation - ships ( M2 . 2 ) as well as partial invariance of the factor loadings for facet community impact ( M2 . 4 ) , where the item ‘ environmentally friendly firm ’ was not culturally invariant . Only the facet personal fulfilment ( M2 . 3 ) showed no cross - cultural invari - ance ( Table 3 , Fig . 1 ) . Notably , factor loading invariance is an important assumption Table 3 Cross - cultural replication of five - facet structure of SES - AS ( German sample 2 , Polish sample , Study 2 ) Model χ 2 df Δ χ 2 Δ df CFI RMSEA M1 .

Study 3 : Criterion validity of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ The criterion validity of the SES - AS was tested in German Sample 2 and the Polish Sample ( H3 – H7 ) . H3 proposed that entrepreneurs ’ achievement of firm performance , i . e . the mean value of that facet of SES - AS , will relate positively to firm pre - tax profit , firm net profit , firm revenue development , and firm employee growth as reported by entrepreneurs . We largely support this hypothesis as we found overall positive correlations ( ranging from r = . 12 , p < . 05 to r = . 41 , p < . 01 ) between the SES - AS facet firm performance and firm - related quasi - objective success indicators in German Sample 2 . In line with H3 we found the facet firm performance related positively to global firm financial success in both samples ( German Sample 2 : r = . 60 , p < . 01 , Table 5 ; Polish Sample : r = . 59 , p < . 01 , Table 6 ) . As proposed in H4 , the facet personal financial rewards correlated positively with entrepreneurs ’ annual income ( r = . 41 , p < . 01 ) and entrepreneurs ’ satisfaction with their financial situation ( r = . 68 , p < . 01 ) ( Tables 4 and 5 ) . Supporting H5 , we found that entrepreneurs ’ self - reported career success linked positively to all five facets of achieved success , ranging from r = . 30 to r = . 47 ( p < . 01 ) . In line with H6 , facets firm performance ( r = . 29 , p < . 01 ) and community impact ( r = . 24 , p < . 05 ) were positively associated with entrepreneurs ’ self - reported creativity ( Table 5 ) . With regard to relationships between ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ and their health in the Polish Sample ( H7 ) , we found the facets firm performance ( r = . 25 , p < . 05 ) , personal financial rewards ( r = . 34 , p < . 01 ) , and personal fulfilment ( r = . 38 , p < . 01 ) related positively to mental health ( Table 6 ) . Vital exhaustion was significantly and negatively associated with the personal fulfilment facet ( r = − . 29 , p < . 05 ) ( Table 6 ) . Overall , H7 was supported . Notably , 40 % of entrepreneurs reported they were not exhausted at all , 43 % reported medium - level exhaustion , while 17 % suffered severe exhaustion . Finally we addressed Research Question 1 by investigating the relationships be - tween the five facets of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ and the ‘ importance ’ or ‘ value ’ that entrepreneurs attach to those five facets as presented in Wach et al . ( 2016 ) . The following pattern of relationships emerged ( see Table 7 for German Sample 1 and Table 8 for the Polish Sample ) : There are positive correlations for all but one facet . In general , the more important a particular success facet is to an entrepreneur , the more likely it is that he or she will achieve that facet . The exception is personal financial rewards , for which importance and actual achievement do not correlate significantly . The pattern of correlations is similar in the German and Polish samples , i . e . the highest correlation exists between value and actual achievement regarding the workplace relationships facet , followed by community impact , personal fulfilment , and firm performance . We explored to what extent ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ and the ‘ importance ’ or ‘ value ’ entrepreneurs attach to the success criteria are overlapping concepts . To do so , we conducted CFA in which the items of SES - AS and SES - IS loaded on one common first order factor : ‘ entrepreneurial success ’ . This model fitted the data very poorly , both in Germany ( CFI = . 343 , REMSEA = . 126 , df = 527 , χ 2 = 2056 . 543 ) and in Int Entrep Manag J ( 2020 ) 16 : 1123 – 1151 1138 T a b l e 4 C r it e r i on v a li d it y o f S E S - A S ( G e r m a n S a m p l e 2 , S t udy 3 ) V a r i a b l e s N 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 S E S - A S 1 .

Additionally , we tested a five - factorial model whereby the equivalent valued ( SES - IS items ) and achieved success criteria ( SES - AS items ) were forced to load on the same content factor . Similar to the one factor model , the five - factor model fitted the data poorly ( German sample : CFI = . 562 , REMSEA = . 105 , df = 517 , χ 2 = 1561 . 437 ; Polish sample : CFI = . 559 , REMSEA = . 121 df = 517 , χ 2 = 1272 . 891 ) . This indicates the ‘ entrepreneurs ’ valued success ’ and ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ are conceptually different .

Our research addresses this gap by conceptualizing ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ as a multi - faceted concept consisting of firm performance , workplace relationship , personal fulfilment , community impact , and personal financial rewards . These five facets align with the Subjective Entrepreneurial Success - Importance Scale ( SES - IS ) introduced by Wach et al . ( 2016 ) , which captures success criteria valued by entrepreneurs ( ‘ what is important for me ’ ) . In contrast , the SES - AS assesses the status of achievement of these criteria ( ‘ as is ’ ) . Hence , the SES - AS scale measures a unique attribute . The concept of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ and the SES - AS instrument refer to the actual achievement of multiple success criteria simultaneously , thus providing a more comprehensive picture of the entrepreneur ’ s situation . Such multiple criteria are in line with psychological and economic research that highlights individuals pursuing multiple goals ( Gorgievskietal . 2011 ) ordifferenttypesofutility ( OrserandDyke2009 ) ratherthan beingsolelyfocusedoneconomicreturns .

For entrepreneurship research , embracing a multi - faceted view of success enables a more accurate understanding of entrepreneurs ’ decisions and behav - iours , including his or her withdrawal from the firm or its discontinuation . For instance , firm discontinuation is more likely when the overall achievement of success is unsatisfac - tory , rather than when only one facet remains unfulfilled ( e . g . , firm performance ) . Our five – factor structure of achieved success partially corresponds with six dimen - sions of entrepreneurial success as assessed by individual external stakeholders and identified by Razmus and Laguna ( 2018 ) . These are entrepreneurs ’ satisfaction , work - life balance , firm social responsibility , firm reputation , satisfaction of employees , and clients ’ satisfaction . This suggests that business partners , like entrepreneurs themselves , evaluate entrepreneurial success not simply through the lenses of economic indicators . Our research extends previous conceptualizations and measurements of entrepreneurial success that deal solely with the criteria that entrepreneurs value ( Fisher et al . 2014 ; Gorgievski et al . 2011 ; Wach et al . 2016 ) . It also overcomes the deficiency of viewing entrepreneurial success purely through the lenses of global firm performance ratings e . g . , sales orgrowth ( Richard et al . 2009 ) , or of judging a firm ’ s success in relation to competing firms ( LumpkinandDess2001 ) . Ourcomplexconceptualizationofsuccessalsochallenges self - reported measures of success via satisfaction ratings ( Powell and Eddleston 2008 ) .

FollowingthecallofMilleretal . ( 2013 ) , ourresearchalsodemonstratesalignment between theory building ( conceptualization of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ as a multi - faceted construct ) and empirical analysis ( operationalization and measurement of five facets of success ) , in that we have developed a separate theory and one or more hypotheses for each specific facet of success , and treated each facet separately in the analysis . In this way we have obtained accurate and valuable insights into how different facets of achieved success relate to different firm performance indicators and individual level outcomes . For instance , we noticed positive relationships between personal finan - cialrewards asmeasuredviaSES - ASandfirmpre - taxprofitandfirmnetprofit , whilefirm revenue development andemployeegrowthwerepositivelyassociatedwiththefacet firm performance . This pattern of correlations highlights that the owner decides whether the fundsremaininthefirm ( higherscoreon firmperformance ) orareconsumedbytheowner ( higher score on personal financial rewards ) . We also found a significant correlation ( r = . 30 , p < . 05 ) between revenue development and the personal fulfilment facet , sug - gesting that leading a high - performing firm gives the entrepreneur more work flexibility , decision making freedom , and opportunities for personal development – all of which are part of the personal fulfilment facet . While prior research looked at the cross - cultural invariance only with regard to success criteria valued by entrepreneurs , our validation of SES - AS in two samples from different cultures allows us to suggest that achieved success might be a universally applicable multi - faceted construct . The strength of relationships between the items within the single facets was equivalent across cultures , with the single exception of personal fulfilment . Our multi - faceted structure of achieved success enriches our understanding of the social contribution provided by commercial entrepreneurs . Our results are in line with the view that entrepreneurs contribute to collective interests too ( Van de Ven et al . 2007 ) . Thus , our research adds to the recent debate in the literature on the synergy between for - profit and non - profit business objectives , suggesting that altruistic goals can be com - patible with , and can even reinforce other entrepreneurial goals ( Mickiewicz et al . 2014 ) . Prior research found creativity to increase venture performance ( Gielnik et al . 2012 ) , and social entrepreneurs to be particularly creative ( Shaw and Carter 2007 ) ; our studies also support a positive link between the firm performance facet , community impact and creativity . Moreover , we found self - reported career success to be particularly highly related to entrepreneurs ’ personal fulfilment , highlighting the centrality of non - pecuniary rewards for entrepreneurs . Our research also brings together literature on entrepreneurial success and work - related health and well - being . It demonstrates that achieved success is positively associated with better mental health and less vital exhaustion . In particular , low personal fulfilment seems to be indicative of vital exhaustion − a well - established risk factor of coronary heart disease ( Kopp et al . 1998 ) and one of the components of burn - out ( Leiter et al . 2013 ) . Our research further provides valuable insights concerning the relationship between valued and actual achieved success criteria . Our results suggest that valued success criteria motivate entrepreneurs ’ behaviour , as manifested in particularly high Int Entrep Manag J ( 2020 ) 16 : 1123 – 1151 1143 achievement of high priority goals . Yet our study also confirmed that the value - behaviour relationship is not universally positive for all criteria . The exceptions are individual materialistic goals expressed in the personal financial rewards facet of success ; here , desire and achievement were not correlated . Study limitations and implications for future research For future research on entrepreneurial performance we propose a conceptual approach ( Fig . 2 ) that considers ( 1 ) entrepreneurs ’ valued success criteria and ( 2 ) their actual achievement , structured along five facets , and ( 3 ) quasi - objective firm - related performance indicators . This model also takes into account the individual and contextual factors that may act as moderators in the relationship between desired and achieved success . The latter builds on more general work by Fischer and Boer ( 2016 ) ( See Fig . 2 ) . We hope future research can empirically test our model . However , due to its complex - ity , we suggest a stepwise approach to be the most appropriate . We believe it is worth exploring the individual antecedents of ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ ( such as per - sonality traits ) to generate knowledge on the critical qualifications , predispositions , and training of entrepreneurs . For instance , openness to experience may be a good predictor of high achievement of community impact but not necessarily of firm performance . Greater consideration of how contextual social , cultural , and political factors , and economic framework conditions ( including their changes over time ) influence ‘ entrepreneurs ’ achieved success ’ is desirable . This is important for an understanding of , for instance , widespread country differences in the performance of entrepreneurs ( Zahra and Wright 2011 ) . As our research provides insights on the structure of achieved success within a particular time and situational frame , future research might seek to validate if our five facets of success retain their key relevance over time . Fig . 2 Conceptual model of entrepreneurial performance . Shapes with dashed lines represent possible moderators . The dashed arrow illustrates possible feedback from achieved success criteria to valued success criteria Int Entrep Manag J ( 2020 ) 16 : 1123 – 1151 1144 As suggested by Razmus and Laguna ( 2018 ) , who found that there are different structures of success depending on the individual ’ s vs . the firm - level external business partner ’ s evaluations of success , it may be that achieved entrepreneurial success is not an isomorphic construct . Future research may wish to test the structural equivalence across different levels of analysis ; for instance , at the firm level , research could aggregate views of employees and co - owners . Methodologically , our cross - sectional study design prevents us from making causal interpretations . For example , we could not investigate the potential reciprocal relationships between valued and achieved success criteria . What an entrepre - neur values may be determined by what he or she can achieve and vice versa , and how entrepreneurs understand success may have implications for how they go about developing their firms ( Angel et al . 2018 ) . Future research can explore how such processes evolve over time to develop a more fine - grained understanding of the conceptual differences ( and similarities ) between valued and achieved success . Particularly , the phenomenographic research approach as applied by Angel et al . ( 2018 ) to study how entrepreneurs interpret the meaning of different success criteria might be valuable to the further development of measures of success . An interesting attempt to consider short - term and long - term perspec - tives of entrepreneurial success has been made by Staniewski and Awruk ( 2017 ) , who ( though retrospectively ) assessed success during the past year and in the period since the commencement of the company . Longitudinal studies can also increase our knowledge regarding the link between achieved success and health . While few studies have investigated such a link ( Dijkhuizen et al . 2014 ; Gorgievski - Duijvesteijn et al . 2000 ; Gorgievski et al . 2011 ) , future research may want to use SES - AS to explore more comprehensively the impact of entrepreneurial success ( and failure ) on the psychological and physical well - being and health of entrepreneurs . This is crucial because entrepreneurs are responsible for their firms ; their personal withdrawal due to health problems can lead to firm discon - tinuation . Future research may also administer SES - IS and SES - AS simultaneously to pinpoint gaps between the importance of success criteria and their actual achievement , as well as to shed light on the consequences of a possible mismatch for firm perfor - mance and for the individual entrepreneurs . New scales often exhibit low reliabilities , especially when the number of items is low ( Cortina 1993 ) . This is also the case for some SES - AS facets since our aim was to develop an economical instrument that is relatively quick to administer . Nevertheless , future studies may wish to use larger samples to further validate the SES - AS and to improve the reliability of SES - AS by extending the number of items per facet . To further validate the community impact facet of success , future research may include entrepreneurs ’ philanthropic giving , or support of community activities . Studies across countries should explore the facet of personal fulfilment , which was not equivalent across countries . It may be that personal fulfilment is particularly sensitive to cultural differences . We also recommend future research to conduct additional qualitative data collection to investigate the cross - cultural differences in more detail , especially to get a better insight into possible additional criteria that apply to specific countries ( Staniewski and Awruk 2017 ) . Concerns about common method variance are unlikely to be an alternative expla - nation for our findings , as the CFA model forcing all items to load on a common factor was a very poor fit to the data . If common method variance was to play a role in our data , a substantially better fit would be expected . Int Entrep Manag J ( 2020 ) 16 : 1123 – 1151 1145 Implications for practice Our findings emphasize that entrepreneurs achieve multiple success criteria , challeng - ing the traditional view that entrepreneurial success is commensurate only with finan - cial firm performance . Educators may want to highlight such varied entrepreneurial career outcomes when attracting new generations to entrepreneurship . In particular , variety and opportunities for personal development and career progress were found to be valued job attributes for the millennial generation ( Terjesen et al . 2007 ) , and our study suggests these can be fulfilled by entrepreneurship . Entrepreneurs can benefit from our research by systematically monitoring their success using the SES - AS measurement instrument . This will increase their awareness of success fluctuations and may prevent them from neglecting specific success do - mains . Based on the analysis of self - assessed deficits ( and strengths ) using SES - AS and SES - IS , organizations supporting entrepreneurs could develop interventions to help the entrepreneurs to derive more satisfaction from their work and achieve the criteria they value most . For instance , achievement of workplace relationships can be assisted by leadership training or coaching . Furthermore , to uncover ‘ blind spots ’ , entrepreneurs ’ self - evaluations of achieved success can be complemented by peer or employee ratings . Future research can also use the SES - AS instrument to obtain 360 - degree feedback evaluations of achievement , including firm stakeholders in the measure . Based on our findings , we suggest that a high achievement of success can possibly act as a job resource , leading to positive workplace outcomes and diminishing the negative effect of stressors . Stressors can potentially result from poor performance in relevant success domains , for instance when entrepreneurs lack personal fulfilment . Our notion that health and success are positively associated may direct entrepreneurs ’ attention to implement stress reduction techniques , for instance via training of emo - tional competencies or relaxation techniques . More generally , we believe that public communication of our finding that the successful entrepreneurs are those who achieve multiple success criteria simultaneous - ly , may reduce the pressure on entrepreneurs to excel solely in the financial aspect . To avoid frustration and business discontinuation , achievement of non - pecuniary rewards should be accepted to be a legitimate goal of entrepreneurship .
