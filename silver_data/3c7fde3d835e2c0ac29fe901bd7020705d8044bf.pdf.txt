L E T T E R S 1122 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 6 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2004 Mammalian TOR complex 2 controls the actin cytoskeleton and is rapamycin insensitive Estela Jacinto 1 , 3 , Robbie Loewith 1 , 3 , Anja Schmidt 2 , Shuo Lin 1 , Markus A . Rüegg 1 , Alan Hall 2 and Michael N . Hall 1 , 4 The target of rapamycin ( TOR ) is a highly conserved protein kinase and a central controller of cell growth . In budding yeast , TOR is found in structurally and functionally distinct protein complexes : TORC1 and TORC2 . A mammalian counterpart of TORC1 ( mTORC1 ) has been described , but it is not known whether TORC2 is conserved in mammals . Here , we report that a mammalian counterpart of TORC2 ( mTORC2 ) also exists . mTORC2 contains mTOR , mLST8 and mAVO3 , but not raptor . Like yeast TORC2 , mTORC2 is rapamycin insensitive and seems to function upstream of Rho GTPases to regulate the actin cytoskeleton . mTORC2 is not upstream of the mTORC1 effector S6K . Thus , two distinct TOR complexes constitute a primordial signalling network conserved in eukaryotic evolution to control the fundamental process of cell growth . In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , TOR is found in two distinct multi - protein complexes 1 , 2 . TORC1 contains LST8 , KOG1 and either TOR1 or TOR2 ( that is , either one of the two TOR homologues in yeast ) . TORC1 couples transcription , ribosome biogenesis , translation initiation , nutrient uptake and autophagy to the abundance and qual - ity of available nutrients . Thus it functions as a temporal regulator of cell growth 3 . The immunosuppressive and anti - cancer drug rapamycin binds directly to TOR1 or TOR2 in TORC1 and thereby inhibits TORC1 signalling . TORC2 contains LST8 , AVO1 , AVO2 , AVO3 and TOR2 . TORC2 mediates spatial control of cell growth by polarizing the actin cytoskeleton , and thus the secretory pathway , towards the bud or growth site . TORC2 signalling is rapamycin insensitive owing to the inability of rapamycin to bind to TOR2 in TORC2 ( ref . 1 ) . Like TOR , LST8 and KOG1 have obvious sequence homologues in all eukaryotic genomes examined , and mammalian TOR ( mTOR ) forms a rapamycin - sensitive , TORC1 - like complex with mLST8 ( G β L ) and raptor ( mKOG1 ) 1 , 4 – 6 . Sequence homologues of the AVOs are less obvious or have been absent in earlier mammalian databases , and thus the existence of an mTORC2 has yet to be demonstrated . Searches of more recent and complete versions of mammalian genomes revealed fragments of a probable vertebrate homologue of the TORC2 - specific protein AVO3 . Mammalian AVO3 ( mAVO3 ) was cloned from mouse C2C12 cDNA and sequenced , revealing a putative protein of 1 , 708 amino acids that shares about 25 % identity with S . cerevisiae AVO3 . Although there are no obvious functional domains in mAVO3 , there are six regions that seem to be more highly conserved in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Dictyostelium discoideum , Drosophila mela - nogaster and Mus musculus ( Fig . 1a ) . We wished to determine if mAVO3 shares functional similarity with yeast AVO3 . Searches using BLAT ( the BLAST - like alignment tool ) predicted an mAVO3 transcript of about 9 . 5 kilobases ( kb ) . A roughly 9 . 5 - kb transcript was detected in all tissues examined , with a higher signal observed in skeletal muscle , kidney , placenta and leukocytes ( data not shown ) . This tissue expression profile closely resembles that observed for the mRNAs encoding mTOR , raptor and mLST8 ( refs 1 , 5 ) , suggesting that mAVO3 may interact with at least some of these proteins . To test if endogenous mAVO3 forms a complex with mTOR , raptor and / or mLST8 , rabbit antisera were generated that specifically recognize mAVO3 and raptor . Immunoprecipitation of mTOR from HEK293 cells co - precipitated both raptor and mAVO3 ( Fig . 1b ) . Conversely , immu - noprecipitation of either raptor or mAVO3 co - precipitated mTOR ( Fig . 1b ) . Immunoprecipitation of mTOR , raptor or mAVO3 also co - precipitated haemagglutinin ( HA ) - epitope - tagged mLST8 ( ref . 1 ; and data not shown ) . Importantly , immunoprecipitation of raptor did not co - precipitate mAVO3 and vice versa . Together , this suggests that mTOR forms two distinct complexes : one containing raptor and mLST8 , and the other containing mAVO3 and mLST8 . On the basis of the obvious similarity to their yeast counterparts , we refer to these two complexes as mTORC1 and mTORC2 , respectively 1 . The integrity of mTORC2 was not altered after depletion of serum or after depletion of both serum and amino acids from the growth medium ( data not shown ) . We next wished to determine if mTORC2 , like yeast TORC2 , is insen - sitive to rapamycin . In yeast and mammalian cells , rapamycin binds the conserved protein FKBP12 . The FKBP12 – rapamycin complex subse - quently binds to TOR1 or TOR2 in TORC1 ( mTOR in mTORC1 ) and thereby inhibits TORC1 signalling . FKBP12 – rapamycin fails to bind to TOR2 in yeast TORC2 and thus TORC2 signalling is insensitive to rapamycin 1 . To determine if FKBP12 – rapamycin binds to mTORC2 , an epitope - tagged version of FKBP12 was precipitated from HEK293 cells treated with drug vehicle or 200 nM rapamycin for 30 min before cell lysis . FKBP12 co - precipitated mTOR and raptor ( that is , mTORC1 ) , but 1 Biozentrum , University of Basel , Klingelbergstrasse 70 , CH - 4056 Basel , Switzerland . 2 Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology , University College London , Gower Street , London WC1E 6BT , UK . 3 These authors contributed equally to this work . 4 Correspondence should be addressed to M .

In contrast , FKBP12 failed to co - precipitate mAVO3 from either rapamycin - treated or rapamycin - untreated cells . The failure of FKBP12 to co - precipitate mAVO3 was not because of a rapamycin - induced dis - sociation of mAVO3 from mTOR , as the stability of the mAVO3 – mTOR interaction was not affected by rapamycin treatment ( data not shown ) . These observations indicate that mTORC2 , like yeast TORC2 , is not engaged by FKBP12 – rapamycin in vivo . To further investigate the rapamycin sensitivity and insensitivity of mTORC1 and mTORC2 , respectively , we examined the effect of FKBP12 – rapamycin treatment on mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activi - ties in vitro . For both mTORC1 and mTORC2 , autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of 4E - BP1 , an in vitro and in vivo mTOR substrate 7 , 8 , were used to assay kinase activity . mTORC1 autophosphorylates mTOR , whereas mTORC2 autophosphorylates mTOR and mAVO3 . mTORC1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti - raptor , and mTORC2 was isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti - mAVO3 . Both the mTOR autophosphorylation and the 4E - BP1 phosphorylation activities of mTORC1 were inhibited by FKBP12 – rapamycin ( a fivefold reduction with 200 nM rapamycin ; Fig . 2b , c ) . In contrast , neither the mTOR and mAVO3 autophosphorylation nor the 4E - BP1 phosphorylation activities of mTORC2 were significantly affected by FKBP12 – rapamycin ( Fig . 2b , c ) . To determine if the apparent rapamycin - insensitive kinase activity of mTORC2 was indeed catalysed by mTOR , we performed kinase assays in the presence of the mTOR - and PIKK - family inhibitors LY294002 and caffeine 9 , 10 , as well as the PKA and S6K1 inhibitor H - 89 ( ref . 11 ) . Raptor - and mAVO3 - associated kinase acitivities were inhibited by 20 µ M LY294002 and 2 mM caffeine ( > twofold inhibition ) but not by 20 µ M H - 89 ( data not shown ) , indicating that the associated kinase activities corresponded to mTOR in mTORC1 and mTORC2 , respectively . Thus , consistent with the above binding studies , mTORC1 is rapamycin sensi - tive , whereas mTORC2 is rapamycin insensitive . To address if mTOR , like yeast TOR2 , has a role in the control of actin cytoskeleton organization , we examined whether treatment of cells with serum , insulin or amino acids — factors known to activate mTOR sig - nalling — affects the actin cytoskeleton . Serum - starved and amino - acid - starved NIH 3T3 fibroblasts showed few actin fibres ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) . The addition of serum led to the rapid and robust formation of stress fibres or F - actin . This serum - induced stress - fibre formation was insensitive to prior addition of rapamycin ( 20 nM and 200 nM ) . The addition of insulin induced the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles , which was also insensitive to pre - treatment with rapamycin ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) . The addition of lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) also led to rapamycin - insensitive formation of stress fibres . Similar results were obtained with serum - , insulin - or LPA - treated Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts ( data not shown ) . Prolonged incuba - tion of serum - starved and amino - acid - starved NIH or Swiss 3T3 cells with amino acids ( 1 – 8 h ) induced a low level of stress - fibre formation that was also rapamycin insensitive ( data not shown ) . Thus , as shown previously for serum and insulin 12 , conditions that activate mTOR sig - nalling lead to actin polymerization and cell spreading . The rapamycin insensitivity of these responses suggests that if mTOR signals to the actin cytoskeleton , it does so as part of mTORC2 . To investigate if mTORC2 indeed signals to the actin cytoskeleton , we examined the actin cytoskeleton in mTOR , mLST8 , mAVO3 or rap - tor knock - down cells ( NIH 3T3 ) . mTOR and its partner proteins were knocked down ( using small - interfering RNAs , siRNAs ) in serum and nutrient - replete ( unstarved ) cells and in starved cells . The starved cells were re - stimulated with serum before visualization of the actin cytoskel - eton . Reduced expression of target proteins in cells expressing siRNAs was confirmed , as described below . More than 80 % of control cells that had been unstarved or serum re - stimulated spread into the substratum and displayed F - actin fibres ( stress fibres and / or lamellipodia ) ( Fig . 3 ; also see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2 ) . About 50 % of unstarved cells and only 20 % of re - stimulated cells transfected with mTOR , mLST8 or mAVO3 siRNA constructs contained F - actin and remained spread . Conversely , 90 % of unstarved cells and 70 % of re - stimulated cells transfected with raptor siRNA produced F - actin fibres and remained spread . Thus , knock - down of mTORC2 , but not mTORC1 , prevented actin polymerization and cell spreading , particularly in serum re - stimulated cells . To further investigate a role for mTOR complexes in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton , we examined paxillin phosphorylation in the mTOR , mLST8 , mAVO3 or raptor knock - down cells . Paxillin is a protein that when phosphorylated localizes and recruits other signal - ling molecules to focal adhesions 13 . In control cells , paxillin was highly phosphorylated at Tyr 118 ( Y118 ; Fig . 4a ) . Cells transfected with mTOR , mLST8 or mAVO3 siRNA exhibited decreased paxillin Y118 phospho - rylation ( Fig . 4a ) . Cells transfected with raptor siRNA displayed Y118 phosphorylation similar to that of control cells . Thus , knock - down of mTORC2 , but not mTORC1 , prevented paxillin phosphorylation and possibly assembly of focal adhesions .

Furthermore , the observation that knock - downs of mTOR , mLST8 and mAVO3 all cause a similar defect suggests that mLST8 and mAVO3 have positive roles in mTORC2 signalling . To confirm that the siRNA constructs reduced expression of the targeted proteins ( mTOR , mLST8 , mAVO3 and raptor ) , we performed immunob - lots on siRNA - transfected cells ( Fig . 4a ) . mTOR and raptor siRNA knocked down expression of endogenous mTOR and raptor , respectively . As our anti - mLST8 and anti - mAVO3 antibodies detected endogenous mLST8 and mAVO3 in NIH 3T3 cells poorly , we co - transfected the mLST8 and mAVO3 siRNA constructs with vectors expressing Myc - tagged mLST8 and HA - tagged mAVO3 , respectively . Expression of Myc - tagged mLST8 and HA - tagged mAVO3 was knocked down by the mLST8 and mAVO3 siRNA constructs . Knock - down of endogenous mAVO3 was detected in HEK293 cells ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3a ) . Phosphorylation of S6K at Thr 389 was decreased in cells transfected with mTOR , mLST8 or raptor siRNA , but not in cells transfected with mAVO3 siRNA ( Fig . 4a ) . Co - trans - fection of an excess of an HA – mTOR vector with mTOR siRNA restored the phosphorylation of both paxillin and S6K ( Fig . 4b ) . Co - transfection of an excess of an HA – mLST8 or HA – raptor vector with the mLST8 or raptor siRNA construct , respectively , restored S6K phosphorylation ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3b , c ) . Co - transfection of an excess of an HA – AVO3 vector with the mAVO3 siRNA construct restored paxil - lin phosphorylation ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3d ) . These results confirm that the siRNA constructs were functional and specific . Furthermore , they indicate that mTORC2 , unlike mTORC1 , does not signal to S6K , providing further evidence that the two mTOR complexes are functionally distinct . In mammals , Rho , Rac and Cdc42 are among the well characterized members of the Rho family of GTPases that regulate F - actin assembly and disassembly 14 . Expression of constitutively active forms of the Rho GTPases promote organization of the actin cytoskeleton . To investigate if the mTOR and Rho or Rac pathways interact , we examined whether an active form of Rac ( Rac1 - L61 ) or Rho ( RhoA - L63 ) restores F - actin assembly in serum re - stimulated cells that contain mTOR , mLST8 or mAVO3 siRNA . Expression of Rac1 - L61 led to the formation of mem - brane ruffles and lamellipodia ( Fig . 5a ) , whereas expression of RhoA - L63 induced the formation of stress fibres ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4a ) in cells co - transfected with mTOR , mLST8 or mAVO3 siRNA . Thus , activated Rac or Rho suppressed the actin defect owing to the loss of mTORC2 function , suggesting that mTORC2 may signal to the actin cytoskeleton through Rho and Rac . To further investigate whether mTORC2 signals through a Rho - type GTPase , we examined whether mTORC2 controls the formation of active , GTP - bound Rac1 . We measured , using a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) – PAK pull - down assay , the amount of GTP - bound Rac in mTOR , mLST8 , mAVO3 or raptor knock - down cells . A 20 – 30 % decrease in GTP - bound Rac1 was observed in mTOR - , mLST8 - or mAVO3 - siRNA - transfected cells relative to vector - transfected cells ( Fig . 5b ) . In contrast , little - to - no decrease in GTP - bound Rac1 was observed in cells transfected with raptor siRNA . These results suggest that mTORC2 regulates Rac1 activity and thus signals through Rac1 . Consistent with these findings , we observed about a twofold increase in GTP - bound Rac1 when amino acids were added to serum - starved and amino - acid - starved NIH 3T3 cells ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4b ) . Addition of insulin or serum to serum - starved cells also led to a two - to - threefold increase in Rac1 - GTP . Addition of amino acids or serum to starved HeLa cells stimulated GTP loading of RhoA ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4c ) , consistent with the possibility that mTOR also signals through RhoA . Furthermore , the above results suggest that mTORC2 , like mTORC1 , responds to nutrients . a b c IB Rapamycin : mTOR Raptor mAVO3 − + − − − − + + + + − + FKBP12pulldown Expressioncontrol Mock m T O R C 1 m T O R C 2 4 E - B P 1 p h o s p h o r y l a t i o n FKBP12 : Rapamycin : mTOR 32 P mTOR 32 P mAVO3 32 P 4E - BP1 32 P 4E - BP1 32 P mTOR ( total ) mTOR ( total ) 4E - BP1 ( total ) 4E - BP1 ( total ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 . 2 1 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 mTORC1 mTORC2 FKBP12 Figure 2 mTORC2 is rapamycin insensitive .

Furthermore , mTORC2 is rapamycin insensitive whereas mTORC1 is rapamycin sensitive . Thus , mamma - lian cells have two TOR complexes that are remarkably similar to the two TOR complexes previously described in yeast . TORC1 and TORC2 may constitute an ancestral signalling network conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution . What factors are upstream of mTORC2 is not entirely clear . Growth factors , amino acids and cellular energy status signal to mTORC1 through the two tumour - suppressor proteins TSC1 and TSC2 and the GTPase Rheb 7 , 15 . Growth factors and amino acids regulate actin polym - erization ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . 1S ) 12 , 16 , suggesting that growth factor and nutrient cues may also regulate mTORC2 through TSC and Rheb . Furthermore , TSC regulates cell adhesion 17 , 18 . The possible factors downstream of mTORC2 are also unknown . mTORC2 seems to signal to the actin cytoskeleton through Rho GTPases . Similar to TORC2 in yeast 19 , mTORC2 may activate one or more Rho - type guanine nucleotide exchange factors . Interestingly , Cdc42 and Rac1 have been implicated in the activation of S6K 20 , 21 , but this is most probably unrelated to mTORC2 signalling as mTORC2 is not required for phos - phorylation of Thr 389 in S6K . 4E - BP1 could be downstream of mTORC2 as immunoprecipitated mTOR phosphorylates Thr 37 and Thr 46 in 4E - BP1 , but these sites are relatively insensitive to rapamycin in vivo 7 , 8 . Rapamycin - insensitive mTORC2 , which would be present in an mTOR immunoprecipitate , may phosphorylate these two priming sites in vivo allowing mTORC1 to subsequently phosphorylate the rapamycin - sensitive sites Ser 65 and Thr 70 . However , contrary to this notion , mTORC2 did not phosphorylate Thr 37 and Thr 46 in vitro ( R . L . & M . N . H . , unpub - lished observation ) . mTORC2 phosphorylates 4E - BP1 in vitro , but at an unknown site ( or sites ) that may not be physiologically relevant . The mechanism by which rapamycin inhibits mTOR activity is unclear . Given the insensitivity of mTORC2 to rapamycin , conclusions drawn from previous studies that examined the rapamycin sensitivity of immunopurified mTOR need to be re - evaluated . Previous studies , which unknowingly examined a mixture of mTORC1 and mTORC2 , found that mTOR autophosphorylation , and thus intrinsic mTOR kinase activity , are rapamycin insensitive .

The apparent dominance of rapamycin insensitive activity in a mixture could be because mTORC2 is more stable than mTORC1 ( R . L . & M . N . H . , unpublished observation ) . Thus , rapamycin inhibits intrinsic mTOR kinase activity ( in mTORC1 ) rather than , or in addition to , preventing access to substrates as proposed previously 22 , 23 . A parallel study 24 also identified a rapamycin - insensitive mTOR com - plex defined by mAVO3 ( rictor ) . METHODS Constructs and antibodies . pRL41 - 6 is a pcDNA3 - based construct ( with Bam HI - Xba I sites ) that expresses M . musculus FKBP12 - 1A fused to a C - terminal TAP tag . pRL68 - 1 is a pGEX - 4T - based vector ( with Bam HI - Sma I sites ) that expresses M . musculus FKBP12 - 1A N - terminally fused to GST . pRL62 - 3 is a pCI - HA - based 25 construct ( with Mlu I / Bss HII - Sma I sites ) that expresses M . musculus mAVO3 N - terminally fused to an HA - epitope . A PCR - generated fragment of full - length mouse LST8 from IMAGE clone 4222934 was subcloned into pCI - Myc vector 25 at the Eco RI - Xba I sites . Myc - tagged Rac and Rho constructs were previously described 26 , as was PRK5 – HA – mTOR 27 . PRK5 – HA – raptor was obtained from D . Sabatini 5 . For siRNA constructs , the short - hairpin RNA expression cassette , driven by the human H1 promoter 28 ( Oligoengine , Seattle , WA ) , was used to subclone the annealed and ligated 64 - nucleotide sequence containing the 19 - nucleotide sequence from the target transcript . The 19 - nucleotide sequence was designed from the following regions : mouse LST8 ( bases 354 – 372 ) , mouse TOR ( bases 853 – 871 ) , mouse raptor ( bases 1 , 533 – 1 , 551 ) and mouse AVO3 ( bases 2 , 337 – 2 , 356 ) . Rabbit polyclonal anti - mAVO3 antibody was raised against 6 × His - tagged , human AVO3 ( amino acids 288 – 1 , 708 ) . Rabbit polyclonal raptor antibody was generated against GST - tagged human raptor ( amino acids 523 – 1 , 002 ) . The mAVO3 and raptor fusion proteins were expressed in , and purified from , Escherichia coli . Cell culture and transfection . HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM con - taining 10 % fetal bovine serum . Cells were transfected using jetPEI Reagents ( Qbiogene molecular biology , Montreal , Canada ) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and harvested after 24 h . Rapamycin was dissolved in DMSO ( 1 mg ml − 1 ) and used at a final concentration of 200 nM . Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were grown on cover slips in DMEM containing 10 % fetal bovine serum until confluent . To induce quiescence , cells were grown for 6 – 8 days without change of media . Before stimulation , cells were starved of serum overnight . Cells were also starved of nutrients the following day by resuspending cells in PBS for 1 h . Where indicated , cells were then incubated with rapamycin for 10 min , followed by the addition of amino acids and glucose , either with or without serum , or insulin . Amino acid and glucose concentrations were used at standard concentrations present in DMEM . NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown on cover slips in high - glucose DMEM , with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( complete medium ) to about 50 % confluence . Cells were then transfected using Lipofectamine ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , then grown for 24 h in complete medium . In unstarved conditions , cells were maintained in com - plete medium until harvest . For starved or re - stimulated conditions , cells were serum - starved for 16 h , then starved of amino acids for another 30 min . Unless otherwise indicated , rapamycin ( 20 nM ) was added 10 min before stimulation . Serum stimulation was performed for 30 min . Immunoprecipitation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 . HEK293 cells ( in 10 - cm dishes ; about 90 % confluent ) were placed on ice . Extracts from cells correspond - ing to half a 10 - cm plate were used for each immunoprecipitation condition . Cells were washed twice with 1 ml of cold 1 × PBS and scraped in lysis buffer ( 0 . 6 ml per 10 - cm plate ; 40 mM HEPES , 120 mM NaCl and 0 . 3 % CHAPS 5 ) sup - plemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( 1 × Roche complete protease inhibitor cocktail , 1 mM PMSF , 10 mM NaF , 10 mM NaN 3 , 10 mM NaPPi , 10 mM β - glycerophosphate , 10 mM p - nitrophenylphosphate , 0 . 5 mM benzamidine HCl , 1 . 5 mM Na 3 VO 4 and 20 µ g ml − 1 heparin ) . Crude extracts , typically 350 µ l for each immunoprecipitation , were cleared with two 3 min spins at 600 g , and pre - cleared with a mixture of protein - A - , and protein - G - coupled Sepharose for 20 min . Pre - cleared lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 1 . 5 µ l of anti - HA ( for mock immunoprecipitations ) , anti - raptor ( 36T ; Hall laboratory ) , anti - mAVO3 ( 15T ; Hall laboratory ) or 3 µ l of anti - mTOR ( FRAP N19 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruzz , CA ) for 30 min at 4 ° C , followed by the addition of 6 µ l of protein - A - and 6 µ l of protein - G - coupled sepharose , and incubation for an additional 90 min . In Fig . 2a , FKBP12 – TAP was precipitated with 15 µ l of IgG - Sepharose beads ( Amersham Biosciences , Uppsala , Sweden ) for 2 h . Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in 2 × protein sample buffer or kinase assay buffer ( see below ) . Kinase assays .
