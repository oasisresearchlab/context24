Let us find the ways . 1 INTRODUCTION The need for and use of low - cost prototyping and elicitation tech - niques in design is well - established in human - computer interac - tion [ 8 , 16 ] . In human - robot interaction , however , discussion of de - sign techniques such as physical , video , and virtual prototyping , including Wizard of Oz approaches , has inappropriately focused on meeting standards of verifiability and replicability [ 21 , 35 , 43 , 58 , 61 ] more properly applied to controlled experimentation in research thantoresearchthroughdesign . Thesestandardsareusefulwhenap - plied to controlled studies , but when applied to design explorations , they inhibit the broader dissemination of subjective design insights that have a unique value in their own right . Exploratoryprototypingcanhelpresearchersin“makingtheright thing” , where controlled experiments help researchers in “making thethingright” [ 9 , 64 ] . Whenusedfordesignexploration , theempha - sis of rapid prototyping methods should be on flexibility , possibility , and design insights as incubated subjectively through the designer , rather than replicability , specificity , and dispassionately proven sta - tistical results .

Disseminating these insights , together with the context in which they are generated , helps other designers and researchers use those insights to inform new designs , taking into account how their own contexts might differ from the original . In this opinion piece [ 59 ] , we start by arguing ( § 2 ) for the impor - tance of exploratory prototyping techniques in devising new robot forms , actions , and behaviors , and in eliciting human responses to designed interactive features early in the design process . These methods are ideally low - cost , iterative , and should evolve to rapidly respond to the designer’s subjective sense of what works and what does not . Sharing the results of these explorations , even when they are not conclusive , can provide substantial scaffolding within a new design space for other researchers to stand on . Assessment of design explorations using the standards of con - trolled research experiments prevents academic HRI researchers from sharing methods or insights early , when they are the most valuable , before hardware decisions have been finalized and are ex - pensive to revisit . In describing the process used to generate design insights , researchersshouldnotfocuson replicabilityofoutcomes , but rather on an understanding of context of the design process—context provides designers an understanding of when and how others’ in - sights can inform their own designs . Similar conversations have taken place in the broader HCI community , and we draw on those conversations—aswellasexamples ( § 3 . 1 ) ofexploratoryprototyping work in HCI and HRI—to offer alternative ways of assessing design explorations in the context of HRI ( § 3 . 2 ) . We then zoom in to present and examine case studies of three design methods : physical prototyping with human - in - the - loop con - trol ( § 4 ) , video prototyping ( § 5 ) , and virtual simulations ( § 6 ) . In each case , we have used these methods to author interactions for users to have with chair robots ( “ChairBots” ) that we are in the process of designing ( Fig . 1 ) . We share these case studies and other examples to illustrate how designers can use these kinds of activities for HRI research , and to help the broader HRI community understand what contributions from such work could and should be ( § 7 ) . 2 EXPLORATORY PROTOTYPING Exploratory prototyping , in seeking to find “the right thing” [ 9 ] , requires researchers to explore wide design spaces , and to rapidly prototype within them—questioning assumptions about materials , users , and contexts . Buxton describes lightweight , inexpensive pro - totyping late in the design process—often by way of testing with potentialusers , togetthe“designright”—incontrasttoexplorationof alternatives , early in the process , that encourages divergent ideation to get to the “right design” [ 9 ] . Inthefollowingdiscussion , wedescribewhywebelieveexploratory prototyping techniques are powerful , why they should be used by human - robot interaction researchers to generate early design in - sight , and why these insights should be considered by the broader HRI community—with an understanding of the ways these insights differ from those offered by traditional controlled experiments . 2 . 1 Figuring out the “right design” The British Design Council’s double - diamond design process [ 5 ] sets out four phases in the design process : discover , define , develop , and determine . Design exploration is the primary goal of the third phase , where designers seek to maximize the design alternatives presented to address the problems and opportunities found in the discover and define phases of the process . As depicted in Fig . 2 , the development phase is a divergent process , intended to generate a wide set of alternatives and solutions . If the search space for possible solutions or solution features is not cast widely enough , the out - comes will be stunted or sub - optimal [ 9 , 17 ] . The goal of prototyping methods is to help designers to generate more alternatives , more divergence in alternatives , and to enable them to elicit stronger and more detailed feedback from users [ 55 ] —critical in the case of social robots , but perhaps less so for the factory floor or industrial variety . While in traditional product design the emphasis is often placed on physical form , the advent of computers and robots has broadened the space of exploration to include motion , action , and behavioral response . Hoffman and Ju [ 22 ] have described numerous methods forearlydesignofrobotmovement , usefulasthemovementsarenec - essarily constrained or enabled by the physical form of the machine . 2 . 2 Prototyping in HRI The human - robot interaction community understandably views ac - tual autonomous interaction with actual robots in actual space as the ideal , most informative manner of prototyping interaction . However , interaction with actual robots in actual space costs a greatdealofactualtimeandactualmoney , nottomentioninvestment in design details as well as modes and contexts of interaction that may well be off - target . Moreover , putting the actual robots perform - ing actual interaction in front of the actual users that will eventually be using the robot may be highly impractical , depending on the users or uses of the robot . It is often necessary and even preferable to use lower - cost , faster , and less actualized prototypes to develop robots and determine their behaviors , actions , and responses . The oft - heard critique that design explorations did not “use a real robot” belies the principle , well understood in traditional design and engi - neering contexts , that increased fidelity early in the design process does not make for better outcomes [ 20 ] . The value of low - cost and rapid prototyping is clear , but low - fidelity prototyping is less well known in HRI to be a critical practice used by designers to construct design knowledge , communicate , and explore ideas in order to make decisions later in the design process [ 45 , 57 ] . Prototypingwithoutanactualrobotalsohelpsroboticsresearchers understand where the lower bound lies : what feature set is truly needed in a robot ? “Does this arm need three joints ? ” “Does this Figure 2 : The British Design Council’s double - diamond design process [ 5 ] alt . HRI HRI ’21 Companion , March 8 – 11 , 2021 , Boulder , CO , USA 20 delivery robot need omniwheels ? ” “Does this turntable need high - power stepper motors ? ” We are liable to make use of these features if they are available to us , even when a lesser alternative would suffice . Realizing that a “real robot” is not necessary to make key discov - eries and contributions to what kinds of interaction and design are desirable is a liberating insight . It is also a matter of equity : low - fidelity prototyping allows researchers without the resources to buy an expensive robot platform , or access to a programmer , to still en - gage in HRI research . Greater participation means more voices and more knowledge of alternatives and how they compare with one another . Dow etal . notethatwithinacollaborativeteam , sharingmul - tiple designs improves exploration , group rapport , and results [ 14 ] . In the larger academic and industrial context , sharing design explo - rations similarly should allow researchers to explore and improve community dynamics , the general knowledge base , and eventual design outcomes [ 18 ] . Prototyping in simulation allows for studies in which all partic - ipants are remote . Remote studies make it easier for researchers to elicit responses from outside of their local area , exposing oppor - tunities for understanding how humans in different cultures and contexts engage in and interpret interactions with robots . Exploratory prototyping is specifically important for human - robot interaction design because the success of such interactions hinges on understanding the human side of the interaction . Wizard - of - Oz and enactment techniques can be used to draw out the many ways a human might respond to various robot behaviors , but using an existing “real robot” constrains the design space substantially . For example , the elicitation of naturalistic human typewritten and speech responses to faux intelligent natural language systems in the early 1980’s was critical to the development of actual natural language understanding in the following decades [ 12 , 26 ] . 2 . 3 When to share : how design generalizes In the quest to obtain “validity” by requiring that the specifications forahuman - in - the - loop“Wizard” - operatedrobotbehaviorbetightly specified and controlled [ 43 ] , HRI researchers are likely to sacrifice generalizability . In our personal experiences as designers , we have found that design insights often generalize when we can find ele - ments of commonality across design instances—feedback on one prototype’s affordances can offer insights into another prototype’s similar affordances . Overgeneralization , however , can result from or result in invalid assumptions and underexplored design spaces . Understanding the nature of the commonality is made possible by rapidly testing out assumptions across a broader design space . Beyond a single project , designs can generalize across domains when there is commonality in specific areas ; a chair robot prototype , for example , can offer insights into other mobile robots with simi - lar affordances or similar motion , or other furniture , depending on the nature of the feedback and the context of use . Design processes themselves can also generalize : approaches for exploring one design space may also apply to another . Understanding when and how design generalizes is easier when designers describe their process in substantial detail , including alter - natives that were explored and discarded . Zimmerman et al . argue that process is important to communicate [ 64 ] —we agree , and fur - ther argue that the value lies not in process replicability , but in understanding how the process context , and its differences from the reader’s context , may influence the offered insights . 3 CASE STUDIES : EXAMPLES AND METHODS OF DESIGN EXPLORATION The low - cost prototyping methods we describe here , and then ex - pand on in subsequent sections , will be familiar from their frequent use in controlled studies in HRI . When used in design explorations , however , there are subtle shifts , beginning with goals : the intent is no longer to identify individual causal factors , but rather to cast as wide a net as possible . To be most useful to the community , we believe design explorations should clearly answer questions such as : What is the context of the exploration ? What is the covered territory within the design space ? What details of the exploration jumped out at the designers ? What did it take to make those observations salient ? Design exploration contributions are ultimately sharing the anecdotal , they are a form of “staged ethnography , ” fieldwork taking place in a particular possible future [ 38 ] , contrived for a specific goal . Authors of design explorations may not always know what they arelookingfor , alongaxesthatareobviouslymeasurable : theyinpart seek to elucidate “unknown unknowns” [ 51 ] through their designs . As a result , in contrast to a traditional ethnography , it makes little sense to only report what the authors think might be relevant—the more inclusive of detail and peculiarity the better , with reduced emphasis on the “typical case” . A single positive example is proof of possibility . In controlled studies , careful study designs and statistical signifi - cancetestingallowscientiststoinfercausalityandattachconfidencetoeffects , even if the effect sizes are quite small and otherwise invisi - bleto ( oftenblinded ) humanobserversorexperimenters . Bycontrast , in design explorations and exploratory prototypes , designers are mapping out a design space by explicitly seeking large effect sizes , often without hiding their manipulations from participants , where direct observations alone can offer confidence in causality because observers can see the actual manipulation ( e . g . , a dancing robot ) having the actual observed effect ( e . g . , dancing bystanders ) . These explorations are not necessarily intended to prove causality , but rather aim to uncover new questions to explore—whether through future design explorations or controlled studies . 3 . 1 Examples from HCI and HRI A few examples from the prior HCI and HRI literature illustrate how the goals of question - uncovering and design - space - mapping are served by design explorations . Odom et al . ’s Photobox [ 39 ] is a point design , contrived to explore the possible effects of “slow technology” in the home . From a deployment in 3 households over 14 months , the authors report that users progressed from frustration to accep - tance , reflecting on past life experiences as well as on technology in the home more generally , and the exploration itself suggests fu - ture work in designing for anticipation and for better understanding what timescales trigger these feelings of frustration and acceptance . Similarly , Martelaro et al . ’s DJ Bot [ 34 ] is a pair of point designs : Wizard of Oz - controlled speech agents for interacting with music in the car and in the home . From deployments with 5 participants , the authors report—among many other findings—that the Wizards make surprising use of live camera data to understand whether a song recommendation is well - received , and offer questions about methods for need - finding to future researchers . In contrast , similar exploratory work in HRI , such as Sirkin et al . ’s Mechanical Ottoman [ 49 ] and Takayama et al . ’s PR2 robots “expressing thought” [ 53 ] , offers design exploration couched in the language of controlled study : in both cases , anecdotally , the work is alt . HRI HRI ’21 Companion , March 8 – 11 , 2021 , Boulder , CO , USA 21 remembered for the remarkable point designs each represents , and not for the unremarkable statistical analyses performed to meet the standards of controlled experiments . From the perspective of future designers of humanoid robots and robotic furniture , those pages might have been better used by offering more detail , for example , on the approaches that failed to elicit the desired responses or on the motivations behind specific design decisions—each of which would have been more enlightening than an inconclusive count of how many participants lifted their legs to receive an incoming ottoman . 3 . 2 Evaluating design explorations In HCI , early conversations around the nature and value of design contributions to the research literature led to Zimmerman et al . ’s identification of four criteria for evaluting “research through design” in HCI : process , invention , relevance , and extensibility [ 64 ] . The HRI community already recognizes certain contributions , such as ethnography , that are not assessed by the standards of controlled studies . Ethnographies do not exactly generalize , but still allow the community to draw inferences from several instances ; similarly , a single “point design” [ 15 ] —a design illuminating one possible point in a design space—may not generalize on its own , but designers can use abductive reasoning to draw inferences from a limited , non - conclusive set of point designs [ 15 ] . For example , in the case studies described in subsequent sections , we explore several point designs for robotic chair interactions— involving multiple people , multiple chairs , and other furniture—that draw upon prior work with single robotic chairs . The existence of multiple point designs lets us draw inferences around methods , peo - ple , and types of interactions , such as the relative importance of timing , or degree of interactivity , compared with robot form , or even function . Sharing point designs would allow researchers to benefit from the currently - undisseminated experiences of other researchers . Zimmerman et al . ’s four criteria offer , in our view , a reasonable starting point for evaluating design contributions to HRI . First , the design process mustbesufficientlywell - describedthatotherdesign - ers should be able to reproduce it , though without an expectation that reproducing the process will result in the same design outcome . Tothispoint , wewouldaddthatthedescriptionoftheprocessshould include enough contextual detail that the reader might understand the offered insights’ limitations and applications to adjacent designs without the need for replication . Second , contributions should be a “novelintegrationofvarioussubjectmatterstoaddressaspecificsitu - ation” [ 64 ] ( invention ) . Third , contributionsshouldoffercleartrans - formative potential , illuminating possible futures and articulating both how those futures differ and why we should care ( relevance ) . Fourth , contributions should enable others to build on the presented work’s methods or generated knowledge ( extensibility ) . 3 . 3 Methods for design explorations in HRI In the subsequent sections , we share case studies of three different methods we have used to explore how we want to design and pro - gram the behavior of a set of chair robots . These case studies are focused on the uses of these three exploratory prototyping methods in the service of design explorations rather than conclusive results — the intent is to provide insight into design directions worth pursuing further [ 19 , 42 ] . Physical prototypes with human - in - the - loop control ( § 4 ) allow for observing responses “in the wild , ” but are slow , technically challenging , and / orexpensivetobuild . Physicalprototypingenables observable field studies whose participants are free to move about , lookaround , andnoticeandinteractwiththingsastheywouldinany physical environment . Creating a novel physical system can require substantial engineering work , even if it employs off - the - shelf parts . Answerable questions include “how do people react to robots in the immediate physical environment ? ” , “how do people respond to this motion ? ” , and “how do human Wizards respond to , or improvise with , common participant responses ? ” Follow up studies should deploy more closed - loop control to enable repeatable motion—but early on , this adds complexity and development time , and does not contribute to the initial goal of observing human behavior . Video prototypes ( § 5 ) are pre - recorded videos of humans inter - acting with robots that are shown to participants , who are subse - quently asked about their interpretation of the shown interaction . Answerable questions include “is the intent of this motion clear and / or interpretable ? ” , “what does this motion look like to a third party observer ? ” , “how do subtle contextual changes affect the per - ception of the robot’s motion ? ” , and “how does the robot’s presence , or changes in its appearance or behavior , alter how others perceive the robot as well as its interaction partners ? ” [ 47 ] Virtual simulations ( § 6 ) straddle these worlds . While harder to develop than video prototypes , rendered 3D and Virtual Reality ( “VR” ) simulations are more immersive and allow for the obser - vation and capture of participants’ live responses to interactions . Pre - programmed motions ensure that participants are responding to precisely designed cues , while human - in - the - loop control allows observation of improvised , or better timed and adapted , Wizard responses to participant interactions . But the lack of physicality prevents participants from interacting with the objects themselves , and the simulation itself may omit real - world physical effects , such as object inertia [ 23 ] or collisions . In the following sections , space constraints limit detail compared with what one would expect from a full exploratory prototyping contribution—these examples are illustrative of kind , not extent . 4 PHYSICAL PROTOTYPES WITH HUMAN - IN - THE - LOOP CONTROL A fundamental part of human - robot interaction is understanding and designing the physical interaction that occurs between humans and the physical robot . Through our motor memory , humans have an intuitive way of understanding and engaging with physical mo - tion in the immediate environment . Physical prototyping allows us to explore how robots’ motions are perceived through this process and implicitly understood . These interactions are mediated by the System 1 mode of thought , defined by Kahneman as an automatic or fast way of thinking , requiring no conscious effort [ 24 ] . A physical prototype should afford the kinds of physicality and interactions representative of those of the eventual robot . First , the robot should look similar to the type of object for which the motions are designed—a chair - robot should look like a chair , a sofa - robot like a sofa . A representative appearance is important because shape and size and their affordances have a large influence on how humans interpret motion . Second , the degrees of freedom of the physical prototype should match those of what the intended ultimate object would similarly be capable of . 4 . 1 Prior work Low - costphysicalprototypinghasarichhistoryofuseinevaluating different robotic objects , including a mechanical ottoman [ 48 , 49 ] , alt .

Similarly , theuseofliveenactmentsasagenerativedesignmethod iswell - establishedinHCI , withvariationsincludingBurns etal . ’s“In - formance Design” [ 6 ] and Odom et al . ’s “User Enactments , ” in which researchers use short embodied experiences with design concepts to explore “radical alterations to technologies’ roles , forms , and behav - iors” [ 38 ] . As Oulasvirta et al . argue , a more accurate understanding of the implications of context can be supported by “bodystorming , ” that is , “carrying out design sessions in the original context , ‘in the wild’ , instead of in the office . ” [ 41 ] Prior work has also addressed the specific question of how to engage in rapid iteration with physical prototyping . One memorable example is Bartneck et al . ’s exploration of how to address questions of form , purpose , social role , and environment through prototypes ranging from paper and mechanical mock - ups to Wizard of Oz re - mote control [ 3 ] . 4 . 2 Case study We used a chair robot to prototype communicative expressions at a nearby university cafeteria . The robotic chair motion was con - trolled by a human operator , Wizard of Oz - style , to communicate its availability to be “sat in” to cafe patrons that had just paid for their food and were looking for a place to sit ( see Fig . 3 ) . If cafe - goers noticed or interacted with the chair robot in any way , researchers would approach them after the interaction with a consent form and a survey . The survey asked about first impressions of the robot , and what was , and was not , “alright” about the interaction . Ourquestionswereintentionallyopen - endedsoasnottoprimefor specifictypesofanswers . Additionally , thespacewasvideorecorded with multiple cameras to allow us to reconstruct the detailed mo - tion and interaction between the chair and participants . We found several themes in viewers’ responses ( N = 33 ) , and many , including social engagement and safety , came up in both the “alright” and “not alright” sections of the questionnaire . Some viewers indicated their preference for more pro - social behavior with comments including “it tries to sit in the table with us , it feels like the robot knows us , ” while others wanted less social behavior , offering “it came to us a bit too slowly so it was surprising and a bit creepy . . . we weren’t able to use it ( we were already sitting on regular chairs ) . ” Inourexplorations , wefoundthatitwasincrediblydifficulttocon - vinceparticipantstositintherobotchair . Fromparticipantresponses and human controller observations , it seemed that the timing of the interactions was critically important to engaging participants . 4 . 3 Discussion The most important outcome of the case study , for us , was to reveal the importance of timing in creating a successful interaction , and to suggest a critical question for follow - up exploration . Physical proto - typingenablesthediscoveryofpotentialinteractionparameterssuchastiming , proxemics , and movement paths . Physical prototypes also allow people to form their judgements based on the presented affor - dances of both the robot ( e . g . size , apparent motion characteristics ) and the situation ( e . g . physical and social surroundings ) . In general , physical prototyping is useful for developing an understanding of how humans will interact with a prototype robot physically , “in the wild , ” in a space populated by other real humans . Through physical prototypes , wealsogetclosetoa“representativefidelity”thatallows our results to transfer to other robots and contexts more easily—but for this , we must pay special attention to designing the appearance of the robot . In the chair robot case , the form should appear as “a chair that is robotic” rather than “a robot that is a chair . ” This trans - ferable design , in combination with unsuspecting bystanders—or participants , can yield a powerful research tool to explore new types of robots inhabiting various spaces . 4 . 3 . 1 Limitations . Human - in - the - loop control enables researchers to experiment with different kinds of motion without engineering automation , however , it also limits fidelity as the human operator’s ability to respond might not reflect the final robot’s response times or agility . These constraints also affect the researcher’s ability to record and repeat identically the motions that contribute to success - ful interactions . One challenge is the difficulty of controlling , recording , and then repeating the context in which all interactions take place . As a result , it can also be difficult to understand which factors in the environment—time , movement , lighting , number of bystanders— affect the interaction outcome . 5 VIDEO PROTOTYPES Video prototypes can be very inexpensive to create , but robots de - picted in the scene cannot respond to viewers of the video . A basic version of this method involves video recording a human moving a robot—little more is needed than a phone with a camera and an object that is plausibly robotic . A higher - fidelity version of this tech - nique involves recording in front of a green screen and removing the human controller from the scene afterward , using video editing software . Removing the otherwise visible human controller imparts an illusion of autonomy to the robot , but takes more effort to create . 5 . 1 Prior Work Researchers in HCI have long adapted video prototyping to their ownneeds . Theinherentflexibilityofthemediumallowsresearchers toexplorearangeofvisualexpressionandtorealizeideasearlyinthedesignprocess [ 56 ] . Video has also been used , as we do here , in com - bination with Wizard of Oz techniques [ 33 ] , to aid brainstorming , and as a design material itself [ 7 ] . Video prototyping as a technique in HRI has also been the subject of multiple validation studies [ 52 , 60 ] showing that , although not suitable as a replacement for live field experiments , video - based alt . HRI HRI ’21 Companion , March 8 – 11 , 2021 , Boulder , CO , USA 23 Figure 4 : Top : Video prototype of an “I’m Available” interac - tion , using a visible human in a painter’s coverall to move the chair . Bottom : Video prototype of the “Let’s Help Out” interaction using a green screen and green suit to key out the human controller . HRI trials do report similar results to live trials under controlled conditions [ 60 ] . 5 . 2 Case Study We created video prototypes of chairs communicating requests to engage with humans ( such as “follow me” ) , or offering updates on their status ( “I’m available” ) using their motion alone ( see Fig . 4 ) . We used an ordinary office chair with casters , manipulated by a human , to prototype communicative expressions for our chair robot design . The videos depicted a human controller physically guiding a chair’s movement , steering from the top of its backrest , together with an ac - torinthesamescene . Insomeofthevideos , wedigitallyremovedthe chair’s human controller , leaving only the chair and the actor visible . To gain an understanding of the interpretability of the chair’s mo - tion , we recruited participants through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to view and comment on each scene . Each set of participants was asked to watch a randomly selected set of videos , and then to answer bothopen - endedquestionsabouttheirinterpretationsofthemotion , such as “Describe what you saw in the video” and “How would you characterize the chair ? ” , and to rate , Likert - style , statements like “The chair was responsive to the person” . Our examination of viewers’ responses yielded a few potential avenues for revision and future inquiry . We learned that certain messages were much easier to understand through motion than others , suggesting an investigation of which features of a message might yield greater or lesser interpretability . Observed correlations between ratings of chairs as responsive and expressive suggest that we might aim to design movements that capture both traits . 5 . 3 Discussion Video prototypes allow researchers to evaluate different motions and scenarios with the same chair in the same physical context . Scenario - building enables quick production of 2D video , which in turn allows quick collection of interpretability information . Videos areeasytomake , butdonotallowforinteractivediscovery—theyare pre - recorded , andthusthevideos’subjectscannotreacttoobservers . The nature of video prototyping additionally provides limited oppor - tunity for observing “in the wild” responses of bystanders to robot motion because that motion is performed by an obvious human that is only removed in post - processing . It is possible to be flexible in several ways with video prototypes , including in the movement of the chair and its contexts , for example , in chair appearance , or number of bystanders . Further , this method is inexpensive , quick , and does not require advanced technical skills . Researchers can adjust the videos in subtle ways to find differences in perception , while keeping other elements of the video constant . 5 . 3 . 1 Limitations . Results from cognitive psychology suggest that two people participating in a conversation are far more accurate , compared with bystanders , in understanding the content of the conversation—even with the same amount of information [ 25 ] . This resultcanbeattributedtogrounding [ 10 ] , a“processbywhichpeople establish a mutual understanding through their collaborative efforts to make their meanings intelligible to each other” [ 25 ] —suggesting that there are limits to what we can learn from bystanders’ under - standings of an interaction from video . Further , ashortvideoonitsown , recordedfromoneperspective , is not a complete representation of an interaction , and thus one needs to set the context with a cohesive story . Lastly , participants may not empathize with the people they see in the video , as they themselves are not the ones interacting with the environment . 6 VIRTUAL SIMULATIONS Virtualsimulationscanbeconstructedinafewways , thoughprimar - ilytheyrefertoeitherimmersiveVRworldswithhuman - operatedor code - controlledrobots , ortoscreen - based“videogame” - styleworlds , shown and interacted with using a web browser on a computer . In either case , participants are in control of some aspect of the environ - ment , while most ( or all ) of the rest of the environment is simulated . 6 . 1 Prior Work Simulated environments have proved a valuable tool for the devel - opment of autonomous robotic systems . High fidelity simulations have been used to train algorithms for tasks such as vehicle mo - tion [ 13 , 36 , 46 ] , complex object manipulation [ 30 ] , and indoor nav - igation [ 28 ] . Interactive virtual environments have been used to train robot teleoperators [ 11 ] . There is an increasing body of work intended to make simulation for human robot interaction more ac - cessible . Integrations between ROS and popular game engines [ 29 ] enable responsive robots to exist in the same virtual world as human participants . Leveraging work from animation has been useful in designing social robots and their behaviors [ 1 , 2 , 53 ] . VR environments , while immersive , also suffer from limitations that appear inherent to the form . For example , proxemics are chal - lenging to study in VR because , although proxemic preferences exist in VR [ 63 ] , those preferences appear to be inconsistent between live and VR experiences [ 31 ] . Further , walls and other physical barriers , though visible in VR , do not actually prevent motion—which can break the sense of realism . 6 . 2 Case Study In a recent study , we explored how two control features—the top speed of a chair robot , and the perspective of the first - person camera view offered to the controller—affect the ways controllers navigate a crowded space to reach a goal position . alt . HRI HRI ’21 Companion , March 8 – 11 , 2021 , Boulder , CO , USA 24 Figure5 : A : GrandCentralTerminalinNewYorkCity ( image courtesy Chris Bojanovich [ 4 ] ) . B : Grand Central simulation , rendered in WebGL . Note the chair in the foreground ; the chair’s destination is the white doorway along the back wall . Using an online simulation environment , we drew on the social instincts from ( N = 30 ) geographically distributed human robot controllers—online participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk— asking them to pilot a robot through a crowded 3D environment in order to elicit a variety of motion paths ( see Fig . 5 ) . To elicit socially appropriate behavior , participants were advised to “Try not to hit or scare anyone . Avoid getting in the way ! ” and to control the chair motion using the keyboard arrow keys . We varied the viewport’s perspective—eitheraboveandbehindthechair , oratseatlevelfacing forward—as well as chair top speed—either the same speed as the humanoid agents , or 3 times quicker . A second set of online participants ( N = 30 ) evaluated the social appropriateness of the elicited robot motions . Unlike the pilots , the evaluators were all placed in a third person perspective recreated in the same virtual world . To develop an intuitive feel for this data , we plotted all the trajec - tories taken by each participant , including stops and collisions with passersby ( see Fig . 6 ) . Contrary to our expectations , we found that a high or low camera view did not seem to affect the paths controllers chose , but that controllers in the “higher top chair speed” condition collided with passersby less frequently and for shorter durations . 6 . 3 Discussion The primary lesson we learned from this case study was one we did not expect : our robots were too slow , and we plan follow - on studies to explore the effect of speed on the ability of robots to avoid collisions with passersby . The capacity to replay an interaction from an infinite variety of perspectives is both valuable and unique to this method , offering SLOW FAST LOW HIGH Top Speed P e r s p ec t i v e Figure 6 : Our visualization of all controllers’ trajectories , separated by affordance conditions . Trajectories are shown fromabovefacingdown , startattheleft , andendattheright . tools for prototyping , reflection and analysis of interactions that are impossible in other methods . A good simulation can provide insight into the subjective feeling of the interaction and the actual negotiation between parties ; the simulated robot can respond to the participant , and respond to the participant’s responses too . The fidelity of any simulation should be matched to the questions being asked . Low - fidelity 3D simulations can provide an opportune middle ground for design exploration between video prototyping and physical prototyping—and in some ways surpassing both : In simulation , the initial conditions of any interaction are perfectly reproducible while remaining fully interactive , enabling iterative prototypingandtestingmanyvariationswithslightlydifferentinitialconditionsoraffordances . Being intrinsically replicable , 3D simu - lations also offer an avenue for testing single variable causal effects . Like video , 3D simulation scales readily . A WebGL - based simula - tion can be shown to thousands of people on a crowd - work platform in hours , and simple Mobile - based VR has become increasingly ac - cessible [ 32 ] . Thecapacityforscaleandreplicationenablesexploring questions more challenging for a physical prototype : simulations can offer identical interactions in different cultural contexts , and researchers can test systems in physical spaces where permission would be required and unavailable , or where robot scale prevents real - world evaluation . 6 . 3 . 1 Limitations . Though powerful , 3D simulations are not well - suited for exploring phenomena that are inherently physical or that require real - life contexts—for example , anything haptic , as we can notyetrealisticallysimulatewhatitisliketotouchthings . Physically impossible robots are often easier to program than realistic ones , and researchers can ignore physical limitations—for better or worse . For example , while bodily harm is impossible , knowledge of that fact can encourage participants to do unrealistic things . Lastly , the constructed nature of simulations makes this method unsuitable for “field studies” of unsuspecting participants . alt .

Other differ - ences bear discussion , and we hope this work will serve as a catalyst for future discussions . 7 . 1 . 1 Controlling robot motion . Video prototypes and virtual simu - lationsprovidetheeasiestinterfacesforproducingnaturalisticrobotmotionsinavarietyofcontexts , but at the cost of realism ( due to visible human operators or physical constraints on green screen deployment ) and responsiveness to participant behavior . The ease and low cost with which a variety of robot motions and interactions can be explored enables very rapid iteration at the earliest stages of design , when the mere act of viewing a video playback of your own best guess at motion provides a great deal of insight . These prototypes can be plentiful and generative , and used in the way that sketches are used elsewhere in design . In our own work , we have often led with storyboards and video prototypes , moving to 3D simulations or physical prototyping after developinganintuitionforwhattypesofrobotcapabilitiesandaffor - dances are worth examining in real life with real participants . The chair robot explorations described here have a longer history than the individual case studies presented , ultimately beginning with video recordings from a workshop of human - moved chairs dancing in a large atrium space . 7 . 1 . 2 Immersion and naturalistic environments . In a video proto - type , compared with a simulated environment , it is easy to include real people in real physical contexts , which can help viewers imag - ine the real experience , and avoid the distraction and prejudice that comeswithavideogame - stylerenderingenvironment . Crowd - work platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk allow researchers to easily get an understanding of participants’ perspectives as bystanders to nearly any video prototype - based interaction . In contrast , simulated environments offer the ability to observe how participants react to robot motion that responds to participant action . Simulated environments make tracking all actions and inter - actions easy , where a physical environment might require a complex tracking setup to collect data on participants’ motions . Simulations also offer the flexibility and control to violate physical laws , put peo - ple in semi - unsafe situations ( especially useful in driving studies ) and program events to happen reliably and repeatably . Aphysicalprototypehasnoneoftheseadvantages , butdoesallow a degree of immersion impossible to otherwise achieve . A robot rapidly approaching you in the physical world is a very different ex - periencethanobservingthesameonamonitororeveninVR , andthis can make the physical prototype the more ecologically valid choice . Physical prototypes complement video prototypes by offering strong evidence of behavior “in the wild” with limited priming [ 54 ] and demand effects [ 40 ] . These in - situ studies can validate the in - sights generated by earlier methods and provide an understanding of how the dynamic human - robot system evolves after the first or second interactions that can be plausibly prototyped in video . 7 . 1 . 3 Technical effort . Significant engineering effort may be re - quired to create a physical robot prototype capable of performing the same motions , with similar fidelity , that a human can perform by manipulating an armature or by moving a large , heavy “mobile” object such as a chair . Expending this effort has the most value once the potential for design insights from quicker , lower - cost methods has been exhausted . In general , video prototypes and simulated environments are less work to develop than physical prototypes , though there are many exceptions—in cases where an existing robotics platform may be suitable , researchers may be able to trade off engineering effort for monetary expense . The cost of re - recording a video , or even mod - ifying a simulation , is small compared with the effort required to re - engineer a physical prototype ; in the earliest stages of design , iteration speed is critical . 7 . 2 Sharing and Triangulation Stepping back , when we look at the three cases presented here , what is notable is how the strengths of each method help to address holes in the others , and help to buttress an overall understanding—in our cases—of how chair robots would work . Triangulating what is real is easier the more instances researchers have to draw inferences from , but often , research groups do not have the luxury of running studies on multiple platforms and featuring multiple approaches in a research paper . Ideally , the triangulation that would help the formative design process should be able to occur across groups and time . Anecdotally , some of the most valuable conversations at HRI come from sharing not - fully - formed design insights ; as part of the literature , these explorations would broaden access to the insights currently only available to active researchers and other insiders . 8 CONCLUSION Inthispaper , weargueforthevalueofexploratoryprototypesas bona fide research contributions to HRI . We examine how rapid prototyp - ing methods are used differently for this purpose , and argue that this demands different consideration than controlled experiments . We offer suggestions for how to consider exploratory prototype contri - butions , andofferafewsketchesofcontributionsfromourownwork . Further , we argue that standards for research through design that emphasize repeatability and generalizability are harmful to the abil - ity of the HRI community to collaboratively develop new and novel ways of interacting with robots . Recognizing exploratory design lessons , even with various “faked” methods , is crucial to the design of future interactions . We believe that a “real robot” is not required for meaningful and critical contributions to the field of human - robot interaction , that this insight is critical to enabling participation from a broader and more diverse set of researchers , and that there is great value in sharing design insights that suggest interesting avenues of exploration left as future work .
