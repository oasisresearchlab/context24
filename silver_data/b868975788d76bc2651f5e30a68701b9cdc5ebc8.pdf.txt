Four different loss functions are used under noninformative ( Uniform and Jeffreys ) priors . The posterior and marginal posterior distributions are derived . The posterior estimates , posterior risks , preference probabilities , posterior probabilities and predictive probabilities are evaluated to know the ranking of ecological factor . The goodness of the proposed model is assessed . The entire analysis is carried out using a real data set based on the preference for the ecological factors .

Under this technique , pairs of treatments are presented to one or more judges for ranking according to some specific criterion . The PC technique is also considered as an efficient technique to access the preferences when the quantitative measurement of the treatments are either unavailable or accurate assess - ment is impossible . This technique is gaining more attention in different fields of life . The most frequent application of the PC technique is in sensory evaluations , personal rating , marketing , medicine etc . Trained panelists are using this technique in the industry to access customer’s preferences and designing products . Annis and Craig ( 2005 ) and Cat - telan ( 2012 ) used PC technique to analyze sports related problems . Kafyat et al . ( 2020 ) developed Maxwell PC model and analyzed the preference data of brands of drink - ing water under Bayesian paradigm . Sung and Wu ( 2018 ) established a PC technique that can be used as an alterna - tive to the likert scale . Ullah and Aslam ( 2020 ) analyzed the Weibull PC model using noninformative priors under Bayesian technique . A real data set of cellphone brands is considered for analyzing the costumer’s preferences for the cellphone brands . 2 Background The literature different reflects a variety of PC models . Thurstone ( 1927 ) provided fundamental framework for the PC technique assuming the responses of the panelists to fol - low the normal distribution and derived his PC model based on the differences in the choice behaviors . Bradley and Terry ( 1952 ) assumed that the judges responses follow the logistic distribution and suggested a model . Abbas and Aslam ( 2009 ) considered Cauchy distribution to develop PC model . Ullah et al . ( 2020 ) used the Weibull distribution to developed PC model .

Ullah et al . 1 3 ( 1952 ) model for accommodating data with no preferences i . e . tie in the data . They introduced a threshold parameter in such a way that if the difference in the magnitude of the responses is less than the threshold parameter , it will indicate that the judges are unable to differentiate between the two treatments and hence will declare a tie . Davidson ( 1970 ) also extended the Bradley and Terry ( 1952 ) model by introducing a tie parameter in the model . Aslam ( 2002 ) per - formed the Bayesian analysis of the two PC models with ties . van Barren ( 1978 ) suggested six extensions of the Bradley and Terry model and introduced a tie parameter and order effect of the presentation of treatments . For more details one may see Schauberger and Tutz ( 2017 ) , Dittrich et al . ( 2012 ) and Wilgenburg van et al . ( 2017 ) . 3 Motivation Modeling the reliability in the lifetime phenomena in engi - neering has great importance . The Weibull random variables can be used in such cases , so in case of paired comparison perception the preference will be given to the object having more lifetime reliability i . e . take more time to its failure , as compare to the object having less failure lifetime . Some - times a situation occurs when it becomes very difficult for the panelists to show their preferences for the treatments or they are incompetent to recognize the difference and declare a tie between the competing treatments . In our study , we introduce the PC model to accommodate ties declared by the panelists . Our study is a new addition in the field of Bayesian paired comparison , it would be very useful for the researchers and practitioners to analyze their problem with newly developed model . To the best of our knowledge this type of work has not been carried out in the literature so far . We perform the Bayesian analysis of the model using noninformative priors under different loss functions . For illustration , we used real data set collected from the students of the earth science department Quaid - i - Azam University , Islamabad , Pakistan , showing their preferences for the eco - logical factors under study . As far as the comparison of the proposed model with the other models existing in the literature is concerned , some competitive models for paired comparisons are proposed therein . But for the climatic study , we have made use of our own proposed model to compare the climate factors under study . In this study , Sect . 4 defines material and methods includ - ing the development of the PC model , Bayesian analyses of the model using prior distributions such as Uniform and Jeffreys priors and graphical presentation of the marginal densities of the model’s worth parameters . Results and dis - cussions are presented in Sects . 5 . Section 6 concludes the entire study . 4 Material and methods 4 . 1 The proposed model The details for the development of the Weibull PC model is elaborated in Ullah et al . ( 2020 ) . According to the Weibull PC model , the probability of preferring the treatment T j over T k , denoted by 𝜃 j . jk , may be defined as : and similarly the probability of preferring the treatment T k over T j , denoted by 𝜃 k . jk , is defined as : Davidson ( 1970 ) used Luce ( 1959 ) choice axiom in Bradley and Terry model ( 1952 ) for accommodating ties . The Weibull PC model is extended by introducing a new tie parameter ( 𝜀 ) based on the Davidson ( 1970 ) criteria . We considered the ratio scale of the preference probabilities 𝜃 j . jk and 𝜃 j . jk as following : Thus the probability of no preference is denoted by 𝜃 o . jk , and is defined as proportional to the geometric mean of the two preference probabilities 𝜃 j . jk and 𝜃 k . jk , i . e . where 𝜀 is the constant of proportionality and also known as tie parameter . As the sum of probability is equals one , so by using ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) we obtain the following probabilities ; ( 1 ) 𝜃 j . jk = 𝛾 3 j 𝛾 3 j + 𝛾 3 k , ( 2 ) 𝜃 j . jk = 𝛾 3 j 𝛾 3 j + 𝛾 3 k . ( 3 ) 𝜃 j . jk 𝜃 k . jk = 𝛾 3 j 𝛾 3 k , 𝜃 j . jk ≠ 0 , 1 for all ( j , k ) . ( 4 ) 𝜃 o . jk = 𝜀 √ 𝜃 j . jk . 𝜃 k . jk 𝜀 > 0 , ( 5 ) 𝜃 j . jk = 𝛾 3 j 𝛾 3 j + 𝛾 3 k + 𝜀 √ 𝛾 3 j . 𝛾 3 k ( 6 ) 𝜃 k . jk = 𝛾 3 k 𝛾 3 j + 𝛾 3 k + 𝜀 √ 𝛾 3 j . 𝛾 3 k 2761 On ranking climate factors affecting the living organisms based on paired comparison model , … 1 3 Here 𝛾 j , j = 1 , 2 , … , m denotes the treatment parameters and 𝜀 is the tie parameter . The expressions ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) represent the extended Weibull PC model with ties . Here . 𝜃 j . jkr will take the value 1 if the treatment T j is preferred to T k otherwise 0 in rth repetition of a comparison . 𝜃 k . jkr will take the value 1 when treatment T k is preferred to T j otherwise 0 in rth repetition of a comparison . 𝜃 o . jkr stands for the treatment T j is tied to the treatment T k in rth repetition of a comparison . n j . jk = ∑ r 𝜃 j . jkr is the number of times the treatment T j is preferred to T k . n k . jk = ∑ r 𝜃 k . jkr is the number of times the treatment T k is preferred to T j . n o . jk = ∑ r 𝜃 o . jkr is the number of times the treatment T j is tied to the treatment T k . n jk is the total number of times the treatment T j is compared with the treatment T k and the T j and T k are tied . Such that : n jk = n j . jk + n k . jk + n o . jk 4 . 2 Prior distributions for the proposed model For the Bayesian analysis of the proposed model : two nonin - formative Uniform and Jeffreys priors are assumed ( Laplace 1812 ; Bayes 1763 ) . The uniform prior allocates identical prob - ability to each and every unit . Symbolically we can write it as : while the Jeffreys prior can be obtained as : p J ( 𝜙 ) ∝ √ det { I ( 𝜙 ) } . ( 7 ) 𝜃 o . jk = 𝜀 √ 𝛾 3 j . 𝛾 3 k 𝛾 3 j + 𝛾 3 k + 𝜀 √ 𝛾 3 j . 𝛾 3 k p U ( 𝜙 ) ∝ 1 where 𝜙 = ( 𝛾 1 , 𝛾 2 , … , 𝛾 m , 𝜀 ) , where I ( 𝜙 ) denotes the Fisher information matrix . For m = 2 we have Fisher’s Information matrix as : As the Jeffreys prior have long and complicated algebraic expression which is not easy for applying for m = 5 , so we drive the Jeffreys prior numerically for m = 5 , designed in SAS package . 4 . 3 Bayesian analysis of the model The likelihood function of the observed outcomes of the trial “ a ” and the parameters 𝜙 is : where S j = 3 . n j . jk + 3 2 n o . jk . We impose a constraint on the parameters of the model as ∑ mj = 1 𝛾 j = 1 , which shows that the parameters are well defined . The joint posterior distribution for the parameters 𝜙 given data under the noninformative priors are defined as : Here W = 1 denotes the uniform prior , W = 2 stands for the Jeffreys prior and R is the normalizing constant and defined as : The marginal posterior distribution for the parameter of 𝛾 1 using uniform prior is I ( 𝛾 ) = ( − 1 ) 2 | | | | | | | | | | E { 𝜕 2 log l ( . ) 𝜕𝛾 21 } E { 𝜕 2 log l ( . ) 𝜕𝛾 1 𝜕𝜀 } E { 𝜕 2 log l ( . ) 𝜕𝜀 𝜕𝛾 1 } E { 𝜕 2 log l ( . ) 𝜕𝜀 2 } | | | | | | | | | | l ( a , 𝜙 ) = m ∏ j < k n jk n j . jk ! . n k . jk ! . n o . jk ! 𝛾 S j j 𝜀 n o . jk ( 𝛾 3 j + 𝛾 3 k + 𝜀 √ 𝛾 3 j . 𝛾 3 k ) n jk , 𝛾 j > 0 j = 1 , 2 , … , m 𝜀 > 0 .

Ullah et al . 1 3 Similarly we can obtain the other marginal posterior distributions . The data set given in Table 1 used for the analysis is about the preference of ecological factors { Topographic Factors ( TO ) , Edaphic Factors ( ED ) , Pyric Factors ( PY ) , Limiting Factors ( LI ) and Biotic factors ( BI ) } which is collected from the students of earth science department of Quaid - i - Azam Uni - versity , Islamabad , Pakistan . 4 . 4 Graphical representation of the marginal distributions The graphs of the marginal posterior distributions for the worth parameters 𝜙 are given in Figs . 1 and 2 respectively . Figures 3 and 4 represent the marginal posterior distribu - tions for the parameters 𝜙 using the Jeffreys priors . Glancing through the above figures , we observe that all graphs are showing approximately symmetrical behavior under the both of the priors .

Loss function shows the difference between the parameter and the estimate . It is used for the estimation of the parameters . For the accuracy of the method used to analyze the data set , loss function plays an important role . Under the loss function the Bayes - ian estimator minimizes the expected loss based on the posterior distribution . The expected value calculated is considered as Bayes estimates ( BEs ) while the expected loss is represented by the posterior risk ( PR ) . Smaller value of the posterior risk is the indication of higher reli - ability . In this section we present the derivation of BEs and PRs under various loss functions using the uniform and Jeffreys priors . We use four loss functions , namely the Squared Error Loss Function ( SELF ) , Quadratic Loss Function ( QLF ) , DeGroot Loss Function ( DLF ) and Pre - cautionary Loss Function ( PLF ) , ( Sindhu et al . 2019 ) . The Bayes estimators along with their posterior risks are used ( Ullah et al . 2020 ) . The BEs and PRs using various loss functions under the uniform and Jeffreys priors are evaluated and are given in Tables 2 and 3 . Results show that PRs for the parameters of 𝜙 under SELF are smaller as compared to those for the remain - ing loss functions , i . e . DLF , PLF and QLF . The results clearly show that SELF is the most suitable loss function for the esti - mation of model’s parameters 𝜙 . The posterior estimates for the parameters 𝜙 using the uniform prior under SELF are 0 . 2026 , 0 . 22171 , 0 . 1875 , 0 . 11942 , 0 . 1986 and 0 . 1839 , respectively . From the esti - mates , it is clear that the ranking of the ecological factors is as : ED → TO → BI → LI → PY , indicating that Edaphic fac - tor ( ED ) is preferred the most and Pyric factor ( PY ) is the least preferred factor . 5 . 2 The preference probabilities The probability that defines the chance of preferring the eco - logical factor T j over T k in a single comparison . We denote preference probability by p j . jk . The posterior estimates are used to calculate preference probabilities . Since the posterior esti - mates obtained under SELF have minimum posterior risks , so these estimates are used to find the preference probabilities for the worth parameters 𝜙 based on the noninformative pri - ors and are given in Table 4 .

Ullah et al . 1 3 factors pair ( TO , ED ) indicates that TO has 41 . 04 % probability of being preferred against ED and p 2 . 12 = 0 . 5070 indicating 50 . 70 % preference in the favor of ED against TO and there are 8 . 26 % probability that none of the ecological factor will be preferred . In the similar ways , we can interpret the remaining preference probabilities . When we observe the ranking order , we found that there exists complete synchronization between the posterior esti - mates and the preference probabilities . 5 . 3 The predictive probabilities The predictive probability describes the preference of ecologi - cal factor T j over T k in a single future comparison of the two factors ( T j , T k ) . The predictive probability of these two factors ( T 1 , T 2 ) is denoted by P 12 and can be calculated as : where 𝜃 1 . 12 is the model preference probability given in ( 5 ) , similarly the predictive probabilities of P 21 and P 012 can be calculated as following ; P 12 = � 1 0 � 1 − 𝛾 1 0 � 1 − 𝛾 1 − 𝛾 2 0 � 1 − 𝛾 1 − 𝛾 2 − 𝛾 3 0 � ∞ 0 𝜃 1 . 12 p ( 𝜙 | | a ) d 𝜀 d 𝛾 4 d 𝛾 3 d 𝛾 2 d 𝛾 1 , 𝛾 j ≥ 0 , j = 1 , 2 , … 5 . 5 ∑ j = 1 𝛾 j ≤ 1 , 𝛾 > 0 , 𝜀 > 0 . P 21 = � 1 0 � 1 − 𝛾 1 0 � 1 − 𝛾 1 − 𝛾 2 0 � 1 − 𝛾 1 − 𝛾 2 − 𝛾 3 0 � ∞ 0 𝜃 2 . 12 p ( 𝜙 | | a ) d 𝜀 d 𝛾 4 d 𝛾 3 d 𝛾 2 d 𝛾 1 , 𝛾 j ≥ 0 , j = 1 , 2 , … 5 . 5 ∑ j = 1 𝛾 j ≤ 1 , 𝛾 > 0 , 𝜀 > 0 , P 012 = � 1 0 � 1 − 𝛾 1 0 � 1 − 𝛾 1 − 𝛾 2 0 � 1 − 𝛾 1 − 𝛾 2 − 𝛾 3 0 � ∞ 0 𝜃 0 . 12 p ( 𝜙 | | a ) d 𝜀 d 𝛾 4 d 𝛾 3 d 𝛾 2 d 𝛾 1 , 𝛾 j ≥ 0 , j = 1 , 2 , … 5 . 5 ∑ j = 1 𝛾 j ≤ 1 , 𝛾 > 0 , 𝜀 > 0 . where 𝜃 2 . 12 and 𝜃 0 . 12 are defined in ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) respec - tively . The predictive probabilities under both noninforma - tive priors are obtained and given in Table 5 . The predictive probability P 12 predicts the future pref - erence in the contest of ecological factors in their single future comparisons . The predictive probability for preferring the ecological factor TO on ED is 0 . 4109 , which indicates that there are 41 . 09 % chances that the ecological factor TO will be preferred to ED in the single future comparison . The remaining predictive probabilities can be also interpreted on the same lines . From the results obtained , it is evident that the predictive probabilities do agree with the ranking order given by the posterior means under both of the priors . Similar results are observed on the basis of the preference probabilities .

The posterior probabilities are calculated , and decision between the hypotheses is directly made . For the comparison of the worth of any two ecological factors T j and T k , we consider the following hypotheses : We represent posterior probability for H jk by p jk = P ( 𝛾 j > 𝛾 k ) and for H kj , we use q kj = 1 − p jk , so the pos - terior probability for p 12 is H 12 which is defined as : The hypothesis with higher probability will be accepted . The posterior probabilities of the hypotheses H jk and H kj ( j < k = 1 , 2 , … , 5 ) are computed for the nonin - formative priors and given in Table 6 . The posterior prob - ability p 12 = 0 . 0735 for the ecological factors pair ( TO , ED ) indicates that the probability for the ecological factor TO is very small , so we shall reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis indicating a higher preference for the factor ED . From the results , we see that the hypotheses H 21 , H 13 , H 41 , H 51 H 23 , H 24 , H 25 , H 34 , H 35 and H 54 are accepted while all the remaining are rejected . On the same lines we can interpret the remaining probabilities . Our results also indi - cate that ecological factor ED is preferred the most and eco - logical factor PY is preferred least , same ranking is observed through the posterior estimates which shows complete coor - dination among the results . 5 . 5 Plausibility of the model In order to check the plausibility of the new developed model , we use the Chi - square test of goodness of fit . Let ⌢ n jk , ⌢ n kj and ⌢ n 0 . jk denote the expected frequencies that can be obtained as ⌢ n jk = n jk 𝜃 j . jk , ⌢ n kj = n kj 𝜃 k . kj and ⌢ n o . jk = n o . jk 𝜃 o . jk , where 𝜃 j . jk , 𝜃 k . jk and 𝜃 o . jk are defined in ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , respectively . We define the following hypotheses . H o : The model is plausible for any value of 𝛾 = 𝛾 o . H 1 : The model is not plausible for any value of 𝛾 . The χ 2 test is applied to test the goodness of fit of the model . H jk ∶ 𝛾 j ≥ 𝛾 k Vs H kj ∶ 𝛾 k > 𝛾 j , j ≠ k 1 , 2 , … , 5 . p 12 = p ( H 12 ) = p ( 𝛾 1 ≥ 𝛾 2 ) = p ( 𝛾 1 − 𝛾 2 ≥ 0 ) p ( 𝛿 > 0 | a ) = � 1 𝛿 = 0 � 1 + 𝛿 2 𝜑 = 𝛿 � 1 + 𝛿 − 2 𝜑 𝛾 3 = 0 � 1 − 𝛿 − ( 𝛿 − 𝜑 ) − 𝛾 3 𝛾 4 = 0 � ∞ 𝜀 = 0 p ( 𝛿 , 𝜑 , 𝛾 3 , 𝛾 4 , 𝜀 | a ) d 𝜀 d 𝛾 4 d 𝛾 3 d 𝜑 d 𝛿 where 𝛿 = 𝛾 1 − 𝛾 2 , 𝜑 = 𝛾 1 and q 12 = p ( H 21 ) = 1 − p ( H 12 ) The obtained value of the Chi Square statistic for the Extended Weibull PC model is 7 . 227 , with p value 0 . 94946 . So according to decision rule , we conclude that the model under study is plausible and fit for the PC data . 6 Conclusion In this study , we extended the Weibull PC model to accom - modate ties . The model is analyzed under the Bayesian paradigm using noninformative ( Uniform and Jeffreys ) priors . Four different loss functions i . e . , SELF , QLF , DLF and PLF are used for the analysis . A real data set of the preference for the ecological factors is collected from the students of earth science department Quaid - i - Azam University , Islamabad , Pakistan . The Bayesian analysis of the model constitutes the estimation of BEs along with their PRs , the preference probabilities , the predictive probability , hypothesis testing and test for the plausibility of the model . Graphs of the model parameters showed approximately a symmetrical behavior around their BEs for both of the priors . Our results indicate that BEs obtained under SELF have minimum PRs , so on the basis of BEs the ecological factors may be ranked as : ED → TO → BI → LI → PY . Our model gives encourag - ing results and presents the ranking which is generally pre - vails in our society . It is also worth mentioning that results obtained from the both priors agree a lot . The estimate of tie parameter is small and approximately identical under both of the noninformative priors . The p - value found for the model also justifies the right direction for extending the Weibull model for paired comparisons .
