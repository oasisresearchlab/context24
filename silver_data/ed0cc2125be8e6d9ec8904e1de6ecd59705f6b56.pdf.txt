Among UBL proteins , NEDD8 has the highest similarity to ubiquitin , sharing ~ 60 % sequence identity and ~ 80 % homology 3 . After proteolytic cleavage of the 81 - amino - acid NEDD8 precur - sor , the C - terminal glycine is covalently conjugated to the ε - amino group of lysines on protein substrates through an isopeptide bond in a reaction called neddylation . Similar to ubiquitination , ned - dylation requires three sequential reaction steps accomplished by the heterodimeric NEDD8 - activating enzyme ( NAE , NAE1 and UBA3 ) , the conjugating enzymes UBC12 ( UBE2M ) and UBE2F and an incompletely characterized set of E3 ligases 4 , 5 . Neddylation pro - ceeds in a cycle of NEDD8 conjugation to and deconjugation from target proteins , the latter being accomplished by NEDD8 - specific proteases , including the JAMM - metalloprotease CSN5 as part of the COP9 signalosome 6 – 8 , as well as the cysteine proteases NEDP1 ( also known as SENP8 or DEN1 ) 9 – 11 and USP21 ( ref . 12 ) . The best - described function of neddylation involves regulation of cullin proteins . Cullins are scaffolds of cullin − RING E3 ubiquitin ligases ( CRLs ) , with neddylation stimulating CRL activity 4 , 13 . CSN5 deconjugates NEDD8 from cullins , thereby restoring the CRL com - plexes for subsequent cycles of neddylation . Unbiased proteome - wide identification of NEDD8 conjugation sites is hindered by the lack of a screening approach that can discriminate between ubiqui - tin and NEDD8 protein modifications . The state - of - the - art MS approach to map ubiquitination sites is based on the immunoaffinity purification of K - ε GG peptides , which are generated by trypsin digestion of ubiquitinated target proteins 14 , 15 . Thus far , unbiased proteome - wide identification of NEDD8 conjugation sites has been hindered by the C - terminal sequence identity of ubiquitin and NEDD8 ( – LRGG ) , resulting in the same diglycine remnant on modified lysine residues upon tryp - sin digestion , such that the method cannot discriminate between the two modifications . Nonetheless , several non - cullin proteins have been proposed as NEDD8 targets based on in vitro neddylation reactions , pulldowns or immunoprecipitations from transiently transfected or stable cells expressing tagged NEDD8 , followed by immunoblotting or MS 4 , 5 . Recent studies , using either a DUB - resistant NEDD8 mutant or a catalytically dead DUB - trapping mutant have also implicated NEDD8 itself , UBC12 and NSUN2 as NEDD8 substrates 16 , 17 . Such studies have two main limitations . First , endogenously neddylated proteins are immunoprecipitated under non - denaturing conditions and subjected to MS to detect diglycine motifs , under conditions that cannot unambiguously differentiate between NEDD8 and ubiquitin modifications . Second , overexpression of tagged NEDD8 can result in a dysregulated free ubiquitin - to - NEDD8 ratio that might favor conjugation of NEDD8 by the ubiquitin E1 ( UBE1 ) and insensitivity to the NAE inhibitor MLN4924 ( ref . 18 ) . Due to these caveats , uncertainty remains regarding which phys - iologically relevant neddylation targets exist beyond CRLs 4 . To reveal the ‘NEDDylome’ , we devised a K - ε GG MS approach , termed serial NEDD8 - ubiquitin substrate profiling , or sNUSP , that allows discrimination and quantitation of NEDD8 - modified versus Global site - specific neddylation profiling reveals that NEDDylated cofilin regulates actin dynamics Annette M .

Kirkpatrick 2 * , Damian Refojo 3 * and Morgan Sheng 1 * Neddylation is the post - translational protein modification most closely related to ubiquitination . Whereas the ubiquitin - like protein NEDD8 is well studied for its role in activating cullin − RING E3 ubiquitin ligases , little is known about other substrates . We developed serial NEDD8 - ubiquitin substrate profiling ( sNUSP ) , a method that employs NEDD8 R74K knock - in HEK293 cells , allowing discrimination of endogenous NEDD8 - and ubiquitin - modification sites by MS after Lys - C digestion and K - ε GG - peptide enrichment . Using sNUSP , we identified 607 neddylation sites dynamically regulated by the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 and the de - neddylating enzyme NEDP1 , implying that many non - cullin proteins are neddylated . Among the candi - dates , we characterized lysine 112 of the actin regulator cofilin as a novel neddylation event . Global inhibition of neddylation in developing neurons leads to cytoskeletal defects , altered actin dynamics and neurite growth impairments , whereas site - specific neddylation of cofilin at K112 regulates neurite outgrowth , suggesting that cofilin neddylation contributes to the regulation of neuronal actin organization .

Upon Lys - C digestion ( in place of trypsin ) , K - ε GG peptides are generated specifically from NEDD8 R74K - modified substrates . NEDD8 R74K - specific K - ε GG pro - filing identified a set of 607 putative neddylation sites on 341 sub - strate proteins , whose neddylation levels were downregulated by the NAE inhibitor MLN4924 ( ref . 19 ) and / or upregulated by NEDP1 deletion . To validate the sNUSP approach as a tool to identify physi - ologically relevant neddylation targets , and as a proof - of - concept example of how site - specific neddylation modifies the function of non - cullin proteins , we studied the function of neddylation of the actin regulator cofilin ( COF1 ) at K112 in neuronal actin organiza - tion and development . Results NEDD8 R74K strategy for sNUSP by K - ε GG MS . Global profiling of ubiquitin modification sites involves generation of K - ε GG peptides by proteolytic digestion of modified substrates followed by immunoaffin - ity purification 14 , 15 , 20 , 21 . However , this approach does not discriminate between ubiquitin - , NEDD8 - and ISG15 - modified peptides , because all three modifications leave the same diglycine remnant at modified lysines after trypsin digestion . To facilitate unambiguous identification of NEDD8 - modified peptides , we introduced a R74K substitution into the endogenous NEDD8 gene in HEK293 cells using CRISPR – Cas9 , changing the C terminus of NEDD8 from LRGG to LKGG . Digestion with the Lys - C protease before K - ε GG enrichment allows the identi - fication and quantitation of endogenously NEDD8 - modified peptides by liquid chromatography tandem MS ( LC − MS / MS ) via established methods ( Fig . 1 ) . Similar approaches have been employed for SUMO using exogenously expressed variants 22 and alternate proteases 23 that yield K - ε GG peptides upon proteolysis . A benefit of our approach is that the peptide flow - through after NEDD8 - specific K - ε GG puri - fication contains larger , branched peptides from ubiquitinated mol - ecules that can be liberated by trypsin digestion . By performing the standard K - ε GG immunopurification on this redigested mixture , it is possible to perform subsequent ubiquitin substrate profiling from the same sample ( Fig . 1 ) . NEDP1 is a major de - neddylating enzyme for non - cullin tar - gets in mammalian cells . Previous work has shown that ned - dylated proteins like other UBL modifications undergo fast cycles of conjugation and deconjugation 19 , 24 , resulting in the endogenous post - translational modification being present at low steady - state levels . Consistent with this notion , NEDD8 - modified proteins were observed to be largely deconjugated in HEK293 cells and cultured neurons within minutes of MLN4924 treatment ( Supplementary Fig . 1a – c ) . This finding implies that NEDD8 - specific proteases are highly active and posits that de - neddylation - deficient cells should show an increased abundance of neddylated proteins and facilitate identification of otherwise transient modifications . Accordingly , overexpression of NEDP1 and USP21 strongly decreased levels of Myc NEDD8 - conjugated proteins , whereas CSN5 had little effect on the overall neddylation signals ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . Because USP21 is not specific for NEDD8 and can also deconjugate ubiquitin 12 , we focused on NEDP1 and generated NEDP1 - knockout ( Nedp1 KO ) cells using CRISPR – Cas9 . Deletion of NEDP1 in HEK293 , U2OS and NIH - 3T3 cells consistently increased levels of endogenous NEDD8 conjugates ( Extended Data Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1e , f ) . Consistent with previous reports , increased neddylation was accompanied by decreased levels of free NEDD8 in Nedp1 KO cells , presumably due to NEDD8 sequestration in high - molecular - weight ( HMW ) conjugates 16 , 17 ( Extended Data Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1e , f ) . In contrast to the generally increased neddylation , cul - lin modification was decreased in Nedp1 KO cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1g , h ) , likely attributable to depletion of free NEDD8 , thus sup - porting the proposed key role for NEDP1 in maintaining the free NEDD8 pool ( see Coleman et al . 17 ) . However , this decrease in cul - lin neddylation did not substantially affect levels of classic CRL targets nor the cell cycle ( Supplementary Fig . 1i – k ) . Elevated levels of NEDD8 conjugates in Nedp1 KO cells were reversed upon wild - type NEDP1 ( NEDP1 WT ) re - expression , but not by catalytically dead NEDP1 C163A or CSN5 ( Extended Data Fig . 1b ) . Furthermore , MLN4924 treatment strongly decreased all NEDD8 conjugates , indicating that neddylation in Nedp1 KO cells still depends on NAE ( Extended Data Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . We could only isolate partial CSN5 - knockout HEK293 clones , which showed increased neddylation of CRLs ( Supplementary Fig . 2a – c ) , as previ - ously noted 7 , 25 , likely reflecting the essential function of the COP9 signalosome and CRL de - neddylation for cell division . Overall , our results support the notion that in mammalian cells , CSN5 specifi - cally de - neddylates cullin proteins , whereas NEDP1 is a broad - act - ing de - neddylating enzyme for non - cullin substrates . Interestingly , similar observations were also reported for other model organisms ( Arabidopsis , Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans ) 26 – 29 . Generation and characterization of Nedd8 R74K knock - in cells . The NEDD8 R74K substitution did not alter NEDD8 activity , because the conjugation pattern of transiently expressed NEDD8 R74K was qualitatively similar to that of NEDD8 WT , though slightly increased , and sensitive to MLN4924 ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . NEDD8 WT and NEDD8 R74K were efficiently deconjugated by NEDP1 and showed similar conjugation levels to cullin 1 ( CUL1 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 2e ) . m / z I n t en s i t y K G G K NEDD8 R74K Target ( ubiquitinated ) G R K G Ubiquitin Lys - C digestion Immunoaffinity purification with K - ε GG antibody K G G Elution ( ubiquitin ) Immunoaffinity purification with K - ε GG antibody LC – MS / MS analysis Elution ( NEDD8 R74K ) Post - IP digest : + / – trypsin m / z I n t en s i t y LC – MS / MS analysis K G G R Target ( ubiquitinated ) K G G Target ( ubiquitinated ) Trypsin digestion of flow - through ( ubiquitin + leftover NEDD8 R74K / WT + unmodified ) Target ( neddylated ) Target ( neddylated ) Fig . 1 | sNuSP by K - ε GG MS .

Sequencing results indicated that in HEK293 cells , which are mostly hypotriploid , not all alleles were targeted , and the clones maintained some NEDD8 WT expression . Assessment of general neddylation patterns showed no differences between Nedd8 R74K and parental Nedd8 WT cells , increased overall neddylation signal in Nedp1 KO cells and drastically reduced NEDD8 conjugation in both Nedd8 R74K Nedp1 WT and Nedd8 R74K Nedp1 KO cells after MLN4924 treatment ( Extended Data Fig . 1c ) . Global ubiq - uitination patterns seemed to be similar for Nedd8 R74K in Nedp1 WT and Nedp1 KO cells and showed little change with MLN4924 treat - ment ( Extended Data Fig . 1c ) . To further validate the expression and conjugation of NEDD8 R74K to target proteins , we analyzed anti - NEDD8 immu - noprecipitations using MS ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) . Peptides distinguishing NEDD8 WT ( ILGGSVLHLVLALR ) and NEDD8 R74K ( ILGGSVLHLVLALK ) were clearly observed from HMW NEDD8 conjugates in Nedd8 R74K cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3c – e ) . The same distinguishing peptides were readily detected in unconjugated NEDD8 ( ~ 10 kDa ) , particularly in Nedp1 WT cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3f ) . Signal intensity comparisons showed that the cells con - tained ~ 1 . 7 times more NEDD8 R74K than NEDD8 WT . NEDDylated and ubiquitinated cell proteome derived from sNUSP . To achieve higher sensitivity for identifying and quantifying low - level neddylation events , sNUSP experiments required large amounts of input protein ( 240 mg per sample ) relative to traditional K - ε GG profiling , which can be successfully performed with < 10 mg input lysate 30 , 31 . Each of the two independent experiments com - prised four primary samples , Nedd8 R74K Nedp1 KO ( DMSO , 24 h ) , Nedd8 R74K Nedp1 KO ( 3 μ M MLN4924 , 24 h ) , Nedd8 R74K Nedp1 WT ( DMSO , 24 h ) , and Nedd8 R74K Nedp1 WT ( 3 μ M MLN4924 , 24 h ) . A Nedd8 WT Nedp1 WT negative - control sample was included in the second experiment . Cursory analysis of known neddylation sites indicated that a subset would generate Lys - C peptides considered too large for identification by standard LC − MS analysis . For this reason , NEDD8 R74K - derived K - ε GG eluates were split in half , and one portion was subjected to additional post - processing digestion with trypsin ( dual digest ) before separate LC − MS / MS analysis ( Fig . 1 ) . From neddylation substrate profiling , we found 1 , 923 unique K - ε GG peptide spectral matches ( PSMs ) derived from 631 proteins ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Unexpectedly , a number of confident K - ε GG peptides were matched in the Nedd8 WT Nedp1 WT sample . Given that these 204 PSMs are derived from some of the most common ubiquitinated peptides ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , they were excluded as neddylation events . Using the quantitative data , results were further subset based on the criteria that bona fide ned - dylation substrates should be downregulated by MLN4924 and / or upregulated in Nedp1 KO cells in at least two experimental contrasts . The resulting list consisted of 850 PSMs that we deem to be puta - tive neddylation events , representing 607 sites on 341 proteins . Of these K - ε GG peptides , 197 neddylation sites on 127 proteins were decreased by MLN4924 treatment ( defined as log 2 fold change of > 2 . 0 for DMSO versus MLN4924 in ≥ 2 of 8 contrasts ) , and 360 neddylation sites on 206 proteins were increased in Nedp1 KO cells ( defined as log 2 fold change > 2 . 0 for Nedp1 KO vs . Nedp1 WT in ≥ 2 of 8 contrasts ) ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Included in the MLN4924 - regulated subset were known NEDD8 targets , such as cullins , UBC12 and NEDD8 , all of which were strongly downregulated by MLN4924 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Additional components of the CRL and neddylation pathway that showed regulation by either MLN4924 or Nedp1 KO included both NAE subunits , E3 ligases and subunits of the COP9 complex ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Notable among these was the CRL exchange factor CAND1 , which appears to be neddylated on several N - terminal residues , including K20 and K60 , which intimately associate with the canonical cullin ned - dylation site 32 ( Supplementary Fig . 3g , h ) . Additional proteins that showed marked differential neddylation in response to MLN4924 ( downregulated ) and NEDP1 ( upregulated ) include NPM , PARP1 , NUCL , RSF1 , NSUN2 , COF1 , CBX3 , WDR61 , XRCC5 and XRCC6 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . To more systematically assess the label - free quantitative data , peak areas for confidently identified K - ε GG peptides from the two replicates were modeled at the protein level using MSstats 33 , and protein - level cutoffs were set at log 2 fold change > 1 . 0 , with – log 10 adjusted P value > 1 . 3 ( P < 0 . 05 ) for the three key comparisons ( Fig . 2a – c ) . Applying these stringent filtering criteria , we observed eight K - ε GG proteins decreased by MLN4924 in Nedp1 WT cells , 29 proteins decreased by MLN4924 in Nedp1 KO cells and 51 proteins increased in Nedp1 KO versus Nedp1 WT cells ( Extended Data Fig . 2a – c ) . In total , 65 unique proteins showed significant downreg - ulation by MLN4924 and / or upregulation in Nedp1 KO cells . These results highlight NEDP1 deletion as a critical tool for detection of otherwise transient neddylation events . Applying the same filtering criteria to the ubiquitin data revealed 18 , 441 unique K - ε GG PSMs derived from 3 , 270 pro - teins ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Protein - level ubiquitination data from MSstats modeling showed that the strongest MLN4924 - and NEDP1 - regulated ubiquitin K - ε GG proteins were largely distinct from the regulated NEDD8 substrates ( Fig . 2d – f ) . Consistent with that observation , correlation analysis did not show coregulation of NEDD8 and ubiquitin log 2 fold changes at the protein level for any of the three key comparisons ( Fig . 3a – c ) . In examining the top 100 log 2 - fold - changed MLN4924 - regulated and NEDP1 - regulated NEDD8 substrates , few showed quantitative changes in their cor - responding ubiquitination signals in any of the three comparisons ( Fig . 3d – f ) . For those that did show quantitative changes , it should be noted that peptides from residual NEDD8 WT protein , present due to the incomplete CRISPR targeting , are expected in the flow - throughs used for ubiquitin analysis . Canonical cullin neddylation sites 34 were identified in the NEDD8 R74K data set , whereas the ubiquitin K - ε GG analysis revealed many more distinct cullin ubiquitination sites ( Extended Data Fig . 3a , b ) . As expected , cullin neddylation was decreased by MLN4924 , and , interestingly , cullins were among the proteins for which neddylation was actually decreased in Nedp1 KO cells ( Extended Data Fig . 3c ) , as recently shown 16 , 17 . Decreased ned - dylation in Nedp1 KO versus Nedp1 WT suggests that these sites ( for example , CUL1 - 5 , HSP7C , SRSF9 , RL11 and RL17 ) are regulated by other , more - restricted NEDD8 proteases , as in the case of cullins by CSN5 . Gene Ontology ( GO ) enrichment analysis showed that neddylation substrates map to a variety of protein classes such as RNA - and DNA - binding proteins , chromatin regulators , ribonu - cleoproteins , ribosomal proteins , chaperones , ubiquitin - and UBL - pathway enzymes , and cytoskeletal and cytoskeleton - associated proteins , with many of these proteins being crucial for dynamic cellular processes , including neuron development ( Extended Data Fig . 3d ) . On average , neddylation substrates had 2 . 03 modification sites per protein compared with an average of 3 . 9 sites for ubiquitination substrates ( Extended Data Fig . 3e ) . In contrast with the well - described SUMOylation motif 35 , 36 , and consistent with ubiquitin , our data set did not reveal a gen - eral consensus sequence for NEDD8 conjugation beyond the conserved consensus site in cullin proteins ( IVRIMK * MR ) ( Supplementary Fig . 3i ) . We mapped the N - terminal neddylation of UBC12 , also recently described by Coleman et al . 17 , to K8 . UBC12 K8 neddylation increased in Nedp1 KO cells and decreased with MLN4924 treatment . Additionally , we detected UBC12 K45 , K72 , K75 and K92 ned - dylation sites downregulated by MLN4924 ( Extended Data Fig . 4a NATuRE STRuCTuRAL & MoLECuLAR BIoLoGY | VOL 27 | FEBrUAry 2020 | 210 – 220 | www . nature . com / nsmb 212 ResouRce NAtURE StRUCtURAL & MoLECULAR BIoLoGy and Supplementary Table 1 ) . UBA3 also showed MLN4924 - and NEDP1 - regulated neddylation sites at K260 , K284 , K398 and K409 ( Extended Data Fig . 4b and Supplementary Table 1 ) . The sNUSP data revealed that NEDD8 itself and ubiquitin are neddylated . K6 , K11 , K22 , K27 , K48 and K54 NEDD8 – NEDD8 link - ages were identified in addition to ubiquitin K48 , all of which were decreased by MLN4924 ( Extended Data Fig . 4c and Supplementary Table 1 ) . These results provide direct evidence for polyneddylation and mixed ubiquitin – NEDD8 chains . Our results suggest that K6 - , K11 - , K48 - and K54 - linked NEDD8 – NEDD8 conjugates are regulated by NEDP1 , whereas K22 and K27 NEDD8 – NEDD8 and NEDD8 – ubiquitin mixed conjugates seem to be independent of NEDP1 ( Extended Data Fig . 4c and Supplementary Table 1 ) , possibly regulated by other NEDD8 proteases , or they may exert structural roles at sites that are or become less accessible to the pro - tease . In a recent study , it was shown that an unanchored NEDD8 trimer binds to the second zinc finger domain of PARP1 ( ref . 16 ) . Our sNUSP data clearly show that PARP1 is among the strongest NEDD8 substrates , neddylated at multiple lysine residues ( K97 , K425 , K528 , K548 , K653 and K849 ) , and heavily regulated by NEDP1 and MLN4924 ( Extended Data Fig . 4d and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Recent studies by Coleman et al . 17 and Keuss et al . 16 used NEDD8 protein - level enrichment to capture proteins conjugated to this UBL . In interpreting these data , it is valuable to keep in mind that neddylation - dependent ubiquitination of substrates remains an alternative interpretation . In our sNUSP experiment , we saw evidence for this on bona fide NEDD8 substrates at ‘less preferred’ lysines that we could not definitively call as neddylated ( for exam - ple , UBC12 K3 and K81 , CAND1 K262 and K826 , RU17 K118 , UBP25 K250 , K254 , K710 and K715 , and PARP1 K700 and K748 ) ( Extended Data Fig . 4a , d , e ) . The most striking evidence support - ing neddylation - dependent ubiquitination , probably mediated by CRLs , comes from the K - ε GG ubiquitin data for LMNA and LMNB ( Extended Data Fig . 4f , g and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ) . b a c Nedp1 KO ( DMSO – MLN4924 ) – 6 – 4 – 2 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 log 2 fold change – l og 10 ( ad j u s t ed P v a l ue ) Decreased with MLN4924 Increasedwith MLN4924 COF1 CUL3UBC12 TCPQ WDR61 NUCL NEDD8 HNRPD NPM XRCC5 CAND1 CUL5 CUL2 CBX5 HNRH1UBA3 SP16H H2B1K MCM6 ANXA6 Nedp1 WT ( DMSO – MLN4924 ) – 6 – 4 – 2 0 2 4 68 1 0 0 1 2 3 4 log 2 fold change log 2 fold change log 2 fold change log 2 fold change – l og 10 ( ad j u s t ed P v a l ue ) – l og 10 ( ad j u s t ed P v a l ue ) – l og 10 ( ad j u s t ed P v a l ue ) – l og 10 ( ad j u s t ed P v a l ue ) Decreased with MLN4924 Increasedwith MLN4924 CUL3 NEDD8 UBC12 CUL5 WDR61 CUL2 COF1 HNRH1 WRIP1 CAND1 XRCC5 HNRPD H2B1K TCPQUBP14 CBX5 ANXA6 NEDD8 R74K K - ε GG proteins Nedp1 KO ( DMSO ) – Nedp1 WT ( DMSO ) – 6 – 4 – 2 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 log 2 fold change – l og 10 ( ad j u s t ed P v a l ue ) Increasedin Nedp1 KO Decreasedin Nedp1 KO COF1 WDR61 CUL3 NPM NUCL UBC12 NEDD8 MCM6XRCC5 CAND1 SP16H TCPQ WRIP1 CUL5 CUL2 HNRH1 HNRPD CBX5 UBA3 ANXA6 UBP14 Ubiquitin K - ε GG proteins Nedp1 KO ( DMSO ) – Nedp1 WT ( DMSO ) Increasedin Nedp1 KO Decreasedin Nedp1 KO – 8 – 6 – 4 – 2 0 2 4 68 0 1 2 3 4 5 OTU7B SYT1 DDX23 KIFC1 M3K1 WDR61 NEDD8 DZIP3 BAZ1A MARE3MK09 CASP3 CYH3 AT5F1 SETX CNKR2 S35B2 EZH2 SAFB1 e d f Nedp1 WT ( DMSO – MLN4924 ) Decreased with MLN4924 Increasedwith MLN4924 – 8 – 6 – 4 – 2 0 2 4 6 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 KCMF1 UBP25 HDGR3 PIMT PAIP1 DDX23CUL3 WDR60 KIFC1CSN7B PP2AA / AB KLH13 BACD1 ZN451 ZCC18 DZIP3 LMNA LMNB1 Nedp1 KO ( DMSO – MLN4924 ) Decreased with MLN4924 Increasedwith MLN4924 – 8 – 6 – 4 – 2 0 2 4 6 8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 PP2AA / AB UBP25 DZIP3 KCMF1 WDR60 PIMT CSN7B CUL3 HDGR3 KLH13 BACD1 ZN451 ZCC18 LMNA LMNB1 Fig . 2 | sNuSP from Nedd8 R74K - knock - in cells in response to MLN4924 and NEDP1 deletion . a – f , Volcano plots showing quantitative NEDD8 r74K - specific ( a – c ) and ubiquitin - specific ( d – f ) sNUSP K - ε GG MS data at the protein level for key comparisons of DMSO vs .

COF1 was among the top neddylation candidates identified by NEDD8 R74K K - ε GG profiling and validated using the epitope - tagged NEDD8 - expressing HEK293 cells , showing strong regulation by NEDP1 and MLN4924 ( Fig . 2a – c , Supplementary Fig . 4d and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Within the sNUSP data set , COF1 K112 was the most frequently detected neddylated residue and was con - served in the closely related family member ADF ( destrin ) ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Site - directed mutagenesis of a set of lysines to arginines con - firmed that K112 , located within the actin - binding helix 4 , is the major neddylation site of COF1 ( Extended Data Fig . 5a , b ) . Consistent with the sNUSP data , pulldown assays , under denatur - ing conditions , showed increased COF1 neddylation in Nedp1 KO cells compared with that in Nedp1 WT cells ( Extended Data Fig . 5c ) , suggesting that under normal conditions , NEDP1 limits the extent of COF1 neddylation . Moreover , denaturing streptavidin - biotin pulldowns showed that COF1 and ADF are neddylated to a similar level and confirmed that K112 is the main neddylated residue in both actin regulators ( Fig . 4b ) . COF1 was found neddylated from recombinant in vitro neddylation reactions ( Fig . 4c ) , and subse - quent MS analysis further confirmed K112 as the major neddylation a c 15 Mg - ATP : NEDD8 - E1 : NEDD8 - E2 : NEDD8 : COF1 33 ng : COF1 167 ng : COF1 333 ng : – + + + + + + + – – – – + + + + + + + – – – – + + + + + – + + – – – + + + + + – + + – – – – – – – + – – – + – – + + + + – + – – + – Anti - COF1 COF1 37 50 10075 2520 15 – – – – – – – + – – + COF1 ~ NEDD8 Stronger exp .

Transiently expressed COF1 was also neddylated in the 6 × His - BIO NEDD8 WT molecular replacement cells and could be suppressed by MLN4924 ( Fig . 4d ) . In transiently transfected cells , NEDD8 WT and NEDD8 R74K showed similar modi - fication of COF1 WT at a lower level than the deconjugation - resistant NEDD8 L73P variant , consistent with COF1 being a NEDP1 - regulated substrate ( Fig . 5a ) . For all NEDD8 variants , COF1 K112R modification was greatly reduced ( Fig . 5a ) . Furthermore , we found that COF1 was neddylated in cortical neurons coexpressing NEDD8 WT or the L73P variant together with COF1 WT , but not the COF1 K112R mutant ( Fig . 5b and Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . To confirm that COF1 is ned - dylated in vivo , we immunoprecipitated endogenous COF1 from brain lysates of wild - type ( Nedp1 + / + ) , heterozygous ( Nedp1 + / – ) and homozygous ( Nedp1 – / – ) gene trap mouse embryos 37 and immunob - lotted for NEDD8 . A band corresponding to the size of neddylated COF1 was readily detectable in the Nedp1 – / – brain sample but only faintly detectable in the wild - type and heterozygous Nedp1 + / – brain samples ( Fig . 5c ) . A distinct set of cofilin and ADF ubiquitination sites was found to be largely unaffected by Nedp1 KO and MLN4924 ( Figs . 3d – f and 4a and Supplementary Table 2 ) . The K112 - containing peptides pres - ent in the ubiquitin data most likely reflect neddylated COF1 aris - ing from the non - targeted Nedd8 WT alleles and leftover NEDD8 R74K peptides in the flow - throughs . This was further corroborated by the similar ubiquitination profiles observed for COF1 WT and the K112R mutant in denaturing pulldown experiments ( Supplementary Fig . 6b , c ) . Our data indicate that the key regulatory activity occurring at K112 was via neddylation . However , given the much higher abun - dance of ubiquitin compared to NEDD8 , we cannot fully exclude the possibility of lower - level cross - talk between ubiquitination and neddylation at this residue . Interestingly , a recent study by Akimov et al . 38 , describing an alternative antibody - based strategy for enrich - ment of ubiquitination sites ( UbiSite ) , found COF1 ubiquitinated at K112 , among many other sites . However , these differences might also reflect cell - type - specific conjugation features , since the UbiSite study was performed with Hep2 and Jurkat cells . Neddylation of cofilin modulates cytoskeletal actin dynamics and neuron development . The sNUSP results suggest that NEDD8 has a plethora of substrates that exert distinct functions that cumu - latively contribute to the cellular effects observed when neddylation is globally inhibited . As proof of principle , we focused on demon - strating the functional relevance of neddylation of cofilin in devel - oping neurons . As a key regulator of actin dynamics , cofilin strongly influences neuron growth and cell migration during brain development 39 – 41 . Acute neddylation inhibition in developing mouse hippocampal neurons ( DIV2 ) resulted in increased filamentous ( F ) - actin staining associated with ectopic lamellipodia - like structures ( Fig . 6a ) . Grossly enlarged growth cones , with increased actin - to - tubulin ratios , were prominent in MLN4924 - treated neurons ( Extended Data Fig . 6a ) . Live imaging of developing neurons revealed lamellipodia struc - tures forming along the soma and shaft of neurites within 2 . 5 h of MLN4924 application and disappearing after MLN4924 washout ( Supplementary Video 1 ) . Interestingly , neurite growth stalled dur - ing MLN4924 treatment and rebounded after MLN4924 washout . Live - cell imaging of neurons expressing LifeAct - GFP revealed increased actin dynamics and retrograde flow within axon growth cones with MLN4924 ( Extended Data Fig . 6b and Supplementary Video 2 ) . Using super - resolution microscopy , we found that dynamic microtubules of MLN4924 - treated stage 1 neurons failed to protrude into the peripheral F - actin network , but instead curled back toward the cell soma ( Fig . 6b ) . This might be due to the denser F - actin network present in neddylation - deficient neurons ( Fig . 6b ) , because controlled cytoskeletal dynamics are a prerequisite for the proper emergence of neurites in neurons 42 .

During neurite outgrowth , polymerizing microtu - bules at the tip of the neurite push towards the membrane , and the network of cortical actin acts as a mechanical barrier for microtubule protrusion 42 , 43 . Cofilin has been shown to regulate actin retrograde flow to organize space for the protrusion and bundling of micro - tubules in the outgrowing neurite 39 . Consistent with the observed cytoskeletal distortions , neurite growth in neddylation - deficient neurons could be largely rescued by actin depolymerization , and to a lesser degree by microtubule stabilization ( Fig . 6c , d ) , indicating that impairments in the cytoskeleton are at least in part responsible for the neurite growth defect of neddylation - deficient neurons . It should be noted that , in addition to cofilin , other cytoskeletal proteins were identified here as neddylation substrates ( for example , STMN1 , PROF1 , ACTB and myosins ; Supplementary Table 1 ) pointing toward the possibility that neddylation broadly modulates cytoskel - etal proteins . Additionally , RNA - and DNA - binding proteins were frequently detected among the neddylation substrates and may also contribute to the observed impairment . What is the functional significance of COF1 neddylation ? MLN4924 treatment did not affect neuronal cofilin levels ( Extended Data Fig . 8a ) ; however , neddylation inhibition and the non - neddylatable COF1 K112R mutant showed decreased cofilin Ser3 phosphorylation , indicative of increased cofilin activity ( Extended Data Fig . 8b , c ) . Despite decreased phosphorylation , association with LIM kinase 1 ( LIMK1 ) and the phosphatases slingshot homo - log 1 ( SSH - 1L ) and chronophin ( CIN ) was preserved for both COF1 K112R and COF1 WT with MLN4924 ( Supplementary Fig . 7a – c ) . In addition to the reduced phosphorylation , MLN4924 treatment induced an increase in actin coimmunoprecipitation with endog - enous cofilin from neurons , as well as HEK293 cells expressing the COF1 WT - BIO - HA construct ( Supplementary Fig . 7d , e ) . COF1 K112R also showed increased association with actin compared to COF1 WT ( Supplementary Fig . 7e ) . It was shown that cofilin and its paralog ADF have overlapping as well as distinct functions on the actin cytoskeleton and neurite out - growth 39 , 44 , 45 . Thus , to study the function of neddylation of cofilin at K112 in more detail , we employed a molecular replacement strategy , in which WT or cofilin variants ( K112R , or constitutively active S3A ) were expressed in cells lacking not only endogenous a b D M S O ( 12 h ) 1 µ M M L N 4924 ( 12 h ) Tyr - tub . + phalloidin Tyr - tub .

In 3T3 cells depleted of ADF and cofilin , the F - to G - actin ratio was markedly elevated compared to parental cells , and re - expression of the non - neddylatable COF1 K112R mutant further reduced the cellular F - to G - actin ratio compared to COF1 WT , to a similar level as the constitutively active COF1 S3A ( Supplementary Fig . 8d ) . These results indicate that neddylation - deficient cofilin K112R has increased actin severing or depolymerizing activity , suggesting that cofilin neddylation is necessary to maintain cellular actin dynamics within specific physiological ranges . With the same molecular replacement strategy in developing neurons , COF1 WT replacement expression rescued the neurite growth defects induced by cofilin and ADF deficiency , whereas the COF1 K112R and COF1 S3A mutants failed to do so , probably due to an excessive destabilization of actin networks ( Supplementary Fig . 8e , f ) . Using in utero electroporation of mouse embryo brains , cofilin and ADF deficiency resulted in reduced apical dendrite length and complex - ity of upper - layer cortical neurons ( Fig . 7a – e ) . Replacement expres - sion of COF1 WT largely restored apical dendrite growth , whereas COF1 K112R and COF1 S3A mutants did not rescue these defects ( Fig . 7a – e ) . Together , these results show that cofilin K112—and pre - sumably neddylation of this residue—regulates neurite growth in cultured neurons and in the developing mouse brain . Discussion A longstanding question in the UBL field is whether additional non - cullin NEDD8 substrates exist 4 .

This approach pro - vided compelling evidence that neddylation is a broad - acting post - translational modification tightly controlled by NEDP1 , which is the key de - neddylating enzyme for non - cullin substrates in mam - malian cells . Compared to previous proteomic approaches based on exogenous expression of tagged NEDD8 and different affinity purification sys - tems 17 , 46 – 48 , the sNUSP strategy based on the Nedd8 R74K knock - in provides several advantages . First , it leverages endogenous NEDD8 expression to avoid potential artefacts from NEDD8 overexpres - sion and atypical neddylation by the Ubiquitin E1 enzyme UBE1 ( refs . 18 , 49 ) . Second , by allowing immediate lysis of the cells under denaturing conditions , sNUSP ensures high stringency , avoiding coprecipitating proteins , which is inevitable for non - denaturing affinity purification protocols performed prior to enzymatic diges - tion . Third , and most importantly , the use of the K - ε GG peptide enrichment increases the detection sensitivity compared to that reached in ubiquitination studies 20 , 21 , 50 – 54 and , recently , in endog - enous SUMOylation studies 23 . Furthermore , a similar strategy could be applied to the interferon - inducible UBL ISG15 , which shares the same C - terminal sequence 55 . There are also limitations associated with the presented method , such as the large amount of starting mate - rial and the need to stabilize neddylation substrates to protect them from NEDD8 proteases capable of wiping neddylation marks from endogenous substrates within minutes during sample preparation . This , together with the fact that the strategy requires genomic editing for the generation of the mutated NEDD8 R74K renders tissue - related analysis of endogenous NEDD8 substrates challenging . For this , an alternative approach , similar to the UbiSite approach for ubiquitin 38 , could be considered . UbiSite relies on generation of a specific anti - body that would allow enrichment of longer remnant signatures derived from alternative proteolysis of ubiquitin or UBL proteins . In addition to the 341 MLN4924 - and / or NEDP1 - regulated ned - dylation events , we also identified a second pool of NEDD8 modi - fications that was insensitive to NAE inhibition . This set of target proteins might either constitute a pool of proteins normally targeted via the ubiquitin conjugation cascade or represent a subset of stable , long - lasting NEDD8 modifications probably involved in structural aspects of protein folding or macromolecular stabilization . Follow - up experiments on cofilin not only validated the sNUSP approach for identifying site - specific endogenous neddylation , but also provided evidence for a physiological function of neddylation of a novel non - cullin target . The neddylated K112 of cofilin is located in its α 4 helix , which is directly involved in actin binding 56 , 57 . Thus , transient NEDD8 conjugation , probably within a locally restricted protein subpopulation , could regulate access of cofilin to actin fila - ments . The transient nature of the neddylation system positions it to facilitate switching of proteins between functional states ( for example , active versus inactive CRLs ) , akin to what is seen with the GDP - GTP cycle in the Rab family . In summary , sNUSP fulfills all proposed criteria for the identi - fication of bona fide NEDD8 substrates 4 , as it detects covalent con - jugation of endogenous NEDD8 ( CRISPR - engineered NEDD8 R74K , no tags , no affinity purification ) to endogenous substrates with site - specific resolution ( direct lysis and analysis of K - ε GG remnants by MS ) under physiological conditions ( no proteasome inhibi - tors ) . Additionally , it allows the parallel mapping of ubiquitination sites from the same sample . Employing MLN4924 and NEDP1 deletion as critical tools , this approach can now be applied for mapping of neddylation in response to different treatments and biological conditions . online content Any methods , additional references , Nature Research reporting summaries , source data , extended data , supplementary information , acknowledgements , peer review information ; details of author contributions and competing interests ; and statements of data and code availability are available at https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41594 - 019 - 0370 - 3 .

Reagents and resources used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 3 in the Supplementary Information available with the paper online . Mice and rats . Mice were group housed ( up to four mice per cage , when possible ) under standard laboratory conditions ( 22 ± 1 °C , 55 % ± 5 % humidity ) with a 12 : 12 h light : dark schedule with food and water ad libitum . Timed pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and CD1 mice were obtained from Charles River . E17 . 5 − E19 . 5 embryos were used to prepare dissociated neuronal cultures . Timed pregnant E14 . 5 CD1 mice were used for in utero electroporation experiments . Generation of Nedp1 − gene trap mice was described previously 37 . For this study , mice were kept on a C57BL / 6 breeding background . For genotyping , DNA was isolated from the tissue by alkaline lysis , and PCR was performed under standard conditions using primers listed in Supplementary Table 3 . All animal experiments for this study were approved by the appropriate local authorities . Animal studies were done in accordance with local regulations and the NRC Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals followed at IBioBA - CONICET and approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Animal studies were authorized and approved by the Genentech Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Dissociated rat and mouse neuron culture . Hippocampal and cortical neurons were prepared from CD1 mouse or Sprague Dawley rat embryos ( E17 . 5 − 19 . 5 ) and maintained in Neurobasal - A medium with 2 % B27 and 0 . 5 mM GlutaMAX ( Gibco ) at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . Neurons were plated on PDL - or PDL and laminin − coated plates or glass coverslips at the desired cell density ( 3 × 10 4 cells per well for an Ibidi 8 - well chamber , 5 – 7 × 10 4 cells per well in a 24 - well plate , 1 – 2 × 10 5 cells per well in a 12 - well plate , 3 × 10 5 cells per 35 - mm glass dish ( MatTek ) , 5 × 10 5 cells per well in a 6 - well plate , 5 – 10 × 10 6 cells per 10 - cm plate ) . Before plating , neurons were nucleofected with 3 – 6 μ g plasmid DNA using the mouse or rat nucleofector kit ( Lonza ) . For biotin - streptavidin pulldown experiments , 4 μ M biotin ( Sigma Aldrich ) was supplemented to the medium and renewed every 4 – 5 d . Cell lines and transient transfections . HEK293 cells ( ATCC , CRL - 1573 ) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) , and U - 2 OS cells ( ATCC , HTB - 96 ) were grown in DMEM : F12 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( VWR ) , penicillin ( 100 units ml – 1 ) , streptomycin ( 100 μ g ml − 1 ) , 2 mM L - glutamine ( all from Invitrogen ) at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . NIH - 3T3 cells ( ATCC , CRL - 1658 ) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % bovine serum ( Gibco , # 26170 - 043 ) , penicillin ( 100 units ml − 1 ) , streptomycin ( 100 μ g ml − 1 ) , 2 mM L - glutamine , and 1 × nonessential amino acids ( all from Invitrogen ) . Cell lines were maintained and routinely checked at Genentech’s cell line laboratory . All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination . HEK293 cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s manual . For biotin - streptavidin pulldown experiments , 4 μ M biotin ( Sigma Aldrich ) was added to the medium . Generation of CRISPR knockout and knock - in cells . For CRISPR – Cas9 experiments HEK293 and U - 2 OS cells were nucleofected using the Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V ( Lonza ) . NIH - 3T3 cells were nucleofected using the Cell Line Nucleofector Kit R ( Lonza ) . To generate KO clones , cells were transfected with pairs of single - guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) and Cas9 - T2A - mCherry ; gRNAs and Cas9 were coexpressed from plasmids . As an optional step , mCherry - positive cells were sorted 72 h after transfection using FACS and replated . KO efficiency was tested 5 − 7 d after transfection by PCR and immunoblotting in cell pools . Cells were then plated for single - clone selection in 96 - well plates . KO clones were screened by PCR and immunoblotting , expanded and frozen . To generate the Nedd8 R74K - KI line , HEK293 cells were cotransfected with one of the three Nedd8 - gRNA - Cas9 - T2A - mCherry constructs and the Nedd8 R74K donor vector , containing a floxed puromycin - IRES - GFP selection cassette . Seven days after transfection , cells were selected with puromycin , and GFP - positive cells were sorted twice using FACS . The best results were obtained with Nedd8 - sgRNA # 1 . To generate Nedd8 R74K - KI Nedp1 KO cells , Nedp1 - sgRNAs # 2 and # 5 were used . Cells were single cloned , selected based on PCR , transfected with cre - recombinase to excise the selection cassette , expanded and frozen . All sgRNA sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 3 . Immunoprecipitation and biotin - streptavidin pulldowns . For immuno - precipitations , cells or tissues were homogenized in RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 . 0 % NP - 40 or Triton X - 100 , and 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate ) containing protease inhibitors ( cOmplete ULTRA tablets , Mini , Roche ) , phosphatase inhibitors ( PhosSTOP tablets , Roche ) , 20 mM NEM and 10 mM 1 , 10 - OPT ( Sigma Aldrich ) . After centrifugation , protein lysates were precleared with Dynabeads Protein G ( Invitrogen ) and incubated with the respective antibody overnight at 4 °C . The antibody − protein complexes were precipitated with Dynabeads and washed . For elution , beads were boiled in reducing 4 × SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting using VeriBlot for IP Detection Reagent ( HRP ) ( Abcam ) as the secondary antibody reagent . For IP samples analyzed by LC − MS / MS , anti - NEDD8 antibodies were coupled to Dynabeads Protein G using freshly prepared DMP ( dimethyl pimelimidate , Thermo Scientific ) following the Abcam protocol ( http : / / www . abcam . com / protocols / cross - linking - antibodies - to - beads - protocol ) to reduce the amount of antibody contamination in the eluted sample . For biotin - streptavidin pulldowns under denatured conditions , cells were lysed in 6 M guanidine - HCl buffer ( 6 M guanidine - HCl , 10 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 1 M Na 2 HPO 4 / NaH 2 PO 4 ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 10 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol ) . After sonification , lysates were incubated with magnetic streptavidin beads ( Pierce ) overnight at 4 °C . Beads were successively washed once with 6 M guanidine - HCl buffer containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , once with 8 M urea buffer , pH 8 . 0 ( 8 M urea , 10 mM tris - HCl , 0 . 1 M Na 2 HPO 4 / NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) and three times with 8 M urea buffer , pH 6 . 3 . Proteins were eluted by boiling in reducing 4 × SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting . Immunoblotting . Cells or tissues were lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors , phosphatase inhibitors , NEM and 1 , 10 - OPT ( all as described above ) when necessary , centrifuged , and protein concentration was quantified via BCA assay ( Pierce ) . Alternatively , cells were directly lysed in reducing 2 × sample buffer . Samples were boiled in reducing sample buffer , separated by tris - glycine SDS - PAGE ( Invitrogen ) , transferred on PVDF membranes ( Bio - Rad and Millipore ) . After blocking in 5 % milk ( Bio - Rad ) or BSA ( Sigma Aldrich ) , membranes were incubated with primary and secondary ( HRP - conjugated ) antibodies . Chemiluminescence signals were acquired on a ChemiDoc imaging system and analyzed using Image Lab software ( Bio - Rad ) . Cell cycle analysis . For flow cytometry of DNA content , cells were serum starved for 24 h and released in 10 % serum - containing medium for 20 h . Cells were trypsinized , fixed with ice - cold 70 % ethanol , treated with RNase I and stained with propidium iodide . Flow cytometry data acquisition was performed on a BD FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer , and data were analyzed using ModFit LT software ( Verity Software House ) . sNUSP – sample prep and mass spectrometry analysis . Detailed information on sNUSP analysis is provided as Supplementary Information available with the paper online . In brief , HEK293 lysate ( 240 mg ) was prepared for each condition under fully denaturing conditions , reduced and alkylated , then digested overnight with Lysyl - endopeptidase ( Lys - C ) ( Wako Chemicals ) . Peptides were acidified with TFA , desalted by solid - phase extraction ( Sep - Pak , Waters ) and lyophilized for 48 h . Dry peptides were reconstituted in 1 × IAP buffer ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , clarified by high - speed centrifugation ( 10 min , 18 , 000 g ) , and subjected to immunoaffinity enrichment using anti - K - ε GG precoupled resin ( Cell Signaling Technology ) . The peptide flow - through was saved for subsequent ubiquitination profiling . Eluted peptides were desalted using C18 Stage Tips 58 . The resulting desalted K - ε GG enriched sample was split into two equal portions and SpeedVac dried to completion . The second portion of the sample was subjected to an additional round of enzymatic digestion for 3 h using 300 ng of trypsin ( Promega ) . Dual Lys - C / trypsin digested peptides were acidified , desalted and SpeedVac dried to completion . Both portions of the sample were separately resuspended in 2 % acetonitrile ( ACN ) / 0 . 1 % formic acid ( FA ) prior to analysis by LC − MS / MS on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer ( ThermoFisher ) coupled to a NanoAcquity UPLC ( Waters ) using methods previously described 59 . Flow - through peptides collected following the immunoaffinity enrichment step of NEDD8 substrate profiling were digested overnight with trypsin ( Promega ) at an enzyme to protein ratio of 1 : 100 and enriched for K - ε GG peptides as described above . Duplicate injections were collected for each sample and analyzed by LC − MS / MS on a Q - Exactive HF hybrid mass spectrometer ( ThermoFisher ) . Analysis of NEDD8 substrate profiling data . Detailed information on the analysis of NEDD8 substrate profiling data is provided as Supplementary Information available with the paper online . In brief , raw MS data from neddylation substrate profiling were searched using Comet against a target - decoy database containing human proteins from UniProt ( version 2017 _ 08 ) and contaminants 60 . Full enzyme - specific searches for Lys - C and trypsin were employed for the Lys - C - digested and dual - digested neddylation samples , respectively . Carbamidomethyl cysteine was considered as a static modification ( + 57 . 02146 Da ) , while K - ε GG ( + 114 . 04292 Da ) and methionine oxidation ( + 15 . 99491 Da ) were considered as variable modifications . PSMs were filtered to 0 . 5 % pepFDR at the run level using Percolator 61 . PSM data across the two bioreplicates were aggregated based on the digestion ( Lys - C only vs . dual digested ) and the two lists subsequently filtered to 1 % protFDR . For PSMs passing the pepFDR and protFDR filters , K - ε GG site localization was assessed using a modified version of the AScore algorithm 59 , 62 and reassigned accordingly . Label - free peak areas were generated using Vista XQuant 63 . Missing values were imputed for data falling below the 1 % quantile in each batch . Quantitative data were filtered to remove lower - quality quantitation events and decoy hits removed prior to modeling with MSstats 64 . Analysis of ubiquitin substrate profiling data . Data from ubiquitin substrate profiling were analyzed using methods similar to those described for NEDD8 substrate profiling , with some modifications .

Gel bands corresponding to neddylated cullin ( s ) migrating between 75 and100 kDa molecular weight , neddylated conjugates between 50 and 75 kDa , and unconjugated NEDD8 at 10 kDa were excised from the gel and digested with trypsin . Peptides were separated by reverse - phase chromatography on a NanoAcquity UPLC system ( Waters ) and analyzed by LC − MS / MS on an LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer ( ThermoFisher ) equipped with an Advance CaptiveSpray ionization source ( Michrom ) set at a spray voltage of 1 . 3 kV . MS1 precursor ions were scanned in the FTMS at 60 , 000 resolution , and MS / MS data were acquired in the LTQ with the instrument operating in data - dependent mode , whereby the top 15 most abundant ions were subjected to CID fragmentation at a normalized collision energy of 35 , with an isolation width of 2 . 0 m / z and 20 - s dynamic exclusion window . MS / MS spectra were searched using the Mascot search algorithm ( Matrix Sciences ) against a concatenated target − decoy database comprised of the UniProt human protein sequences ( version 2016 _ 06 ) , known contaminants and the reversed versions of each sequence . A 50 p . p . m . precursor ion mass tolerance and 0 . 8 Da fragment ion tolerance were selected with tryptic specificity up to three missed cleavages . Fixed modifications were allowed for carbamidomethylated cysteine residues ( + 57 . 0215 Da ) , and variable modifications were permitted for methionine oxidation ( + 15 . 9949 Da ) and K - ε GG ( + 114 . 0429 Da ) . Extracted ion chromatograms over a 10 - p . p . m . mass interval were applied to obtain peaks corresponding to the NEDD8 R74K - specific peptide ILGGSVLHLVLALK in each gel band . More details are in the Supplementary Information available with the paper online . Gene Ontology analysis . Gene Ontology ( GO ) term enrichment analysis was performed with Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships ( PANTHER ) 65 . All neddylated proteins with annotated GO terms were compared against the annotated human proteome . Protein class categories with positive fold enrichment and significant P values < 0 . 01 are shown . Consensus site analysis . Motif discovery was performed using the MEME Suite 66 . The MoMo simple algorithm , from the MEME Suite , was used to identify sequence motifs associated with different types of protein post - translational modifications . For more details , see Supplementary Information available with the paper online . Protein structures . Protein structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ; https : / / www . rcsb . org ) and modified using PyMol . CAND1 K20 and K60 and cofilin K112 neddylation sites identified in the NEDD8 R74K K - ε GG MS experiments were mapped to the cullin 4B – CAND1 – RBX1 ( PDB 4A0C ) and cofilin - actin structures ( PDB 5YU8 ) , respectively . In vitro neddylation assay . Components of the NEDD8 Conjugation Initiation Kit ( Boston Biochem ) were incubated with recombinant COF1 ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) for 1 – 2 h at 37 °C . Samples were separated on tris - glycine gels and analyzed by immunoblotting . Protein bands corresponding to unmodified and neddylated COF1 were excised from the gel and subjected to in - gel tryptic digestion and 60 min of LC − MS / MS analysis , as described above but adding heavy - isotope - labeled internal standard K - ε GG peptides covering COF1 K112 and COF1 K114 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) during the first extraction step . MS / MS spectra were searched as described above . Peptide assignments were filtered to a 1 % pepFDR with precursor ion match mass tolerances of ± 8 p . p . m . Localization scores were generated for each K - ε GG PSM and assessed using a modified version of the AScore algorithm , and positions of the modifications were localized accordingly . Areas under the curve ( AUC ) for COF1 K - ε GG modified peptides and their unmodified counterparts at K78 , K112 and K144 were obtained via integration of peaks present in extracted ion chromatograms over 10 p . p . m . mass intervals using QualBrowser ( ThermoFisher ) . Relative abundance of each peptide ( ratio of AUC ) was then determined relative to the COF1 N - terminal peptide ASGVAVSDGVIK to assess the fraction of modified and unmodified COF1 proteoforms in each gel band . Immunofluorescence staining . Immunofluorescence stainings were performed as previously described 67 . In brief , neurons were fixed with prewarmed 4 % paraformaldehyde containing 5 % sucrose for 20 min at room temperature , washed and permeabilized . For microtubule stainings , neurons were fixed and extracted simultaneously with Triton X - 100 in PHEM buffer , preheated to 37 °C ( 60 mM PIPES , 25 mM HEPES , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl , pH 6 . 9 , containing 0 . 25 % glutaraldehyde , 4 % PFA , 4 % sucrose , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) , washed , quenched with 50 mM ammonium chloride , washed , and permeabilized . After blocking , neurons were incubated with dye - conjugated phalloidin and / or with primary antibodies ( overnight at 4 °C ) , then with Alexa dye − conjugated secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen ) . Samples were mounted in VectaShield ( Vector Laboratories ) , Fluoromount - G ( Invitrogen ) or , for STED imaging , in MOWIOL 4 – 88 Reagent ( Calbiochem ) medium . In vivo F - / G - actin assay . NIH - 3T3 - ADF WT and KO clones were nucleofected with molecular replacement constructs for cofilin . Twenty - four hours after transfection , cells were selected with 1 μ g ml − 1 puromycin for the presence of pLKO . 1 – Puro shRNA vectors for 3 – 5 d , until cells reached 70 – 80 % confluency . Cellular F - and G - actin content was analyzed using the F - actin / G - actin In Vivo Assay Biochem Kit ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) according to the manufacturer’s manual . Supernatant ( G - actin ) and pellet ( F - actin ) samples were immunoblotted with anti - Actin antibodies , and F - and G - actin bands were measured and expressed as F / ( F + G ) ratio , which was normalized to cofilin HA expression levels . In utero electroporation of mouse embryos . In utero electroporation of CD1 mouse embryos was performed as described previously 37 . One to two microliters of high - concentration plasmid DNA was injected in utero into the lateral ventricle of E14 . 5 mouse embryos using a glass micropipette and plunger ( PCR micropipettes 1 – 10 μ l , Drummond ) . Electroporations were performed using an Electro Square Porator ECM830 and Tweezertrodes ( BTX Genetronics ) , to target the developing cortex as described previously 68 , with five pulses ( 40 V , 50 ms duration and 950 ms intervals ) delivered to each embryo . E18 . 5 and P7 brains were fixed by immersion in 4 % PFA / 4 % sucrose , cryopreserved in 25 % sucrose and frozen on dry ice . Brain sections 50 μ m thick were obtained on a cryostat ( Thermo Scientific Microm HM550 ) , stained with DAPI , and mounted on glass slides in VectaShield ( Vector ) medium . Image acquisition and analysis of neuronal morphology . Confocal images were captured with an Olympus IX81 or a Zeiss LSM 710 inverted confocal microscope and processed and analyzed with ImageJ ( http : / / rsbweb . nih . gov / ij / ) . Stimulated emission depletion images were taken using a home - built STED nanoscope 69 , 70 . Quantification of neuronal stages 1 – 3 was performed as described 71 . Neurite outgrowth assays were imaged on a Keyence BZ - X 700 fluorescence microscope equipped with a 20 × Nikon CFI Plan Apo NA 0 . 75 objective . Soma and neurites were identified through a custom thresholding and skeletonizing routine in ImageJ . For time lapse imaging , neurons were cultured on PDL - and laminin - coated glass - bottom dishes ( Ibidi ) . DIC time lapses were performed on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 Epifluorescence microscope equipped with an LCI Plan 63 × NA 1 . 3 W objective , Definite Focus and a CCD AxioCam HRm camera at 10 - min intervals . For live imaging of actin dynamics in growth cones , neurons were nucleofected with LifeAct - GFP before plating and being treated with DMSO or 1 μ M MLN4924 at DIV2 ( ~ 43 h after plating ) . Axonal growth cone actin dynamics were imaged 3 – 5 h later ( DIV2 , 48 h ) on a 3i Marianas spinning disk confocal microscope including a Yokogawa CSU - W1 spinning disc , a Photometrics Prime95B CMOS camera , Zeiss Definite Focus equipped with a Zeiss 63 × Plan Apo 1 . 4 NA objective .
