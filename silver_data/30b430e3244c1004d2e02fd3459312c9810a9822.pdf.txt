BKPyV infection is ubiquitous in the 27 human population , with over 80 % of adults worldwide being seropositive for BKPyV . BKPyV infection is 28 usually asymptomatic ; however , BKPyV reactivation in immunosuppressed transplant patients causes 29 two diseases , polyomavirus - associated nephropathy and hemorrhagic cystitis . To establish a successful 30 infection in its host cells , BKPyV must travel in retrograde transport vesicles to reach the nuclei . To make 31 this happen , BKPyV requires the cooperation of host cell proteins . To further identify host factors 32 associated with BKPyV entry and intracellular trafficking , we performed a whole - genome siRNA screen 33 on BKPyV infection of primary human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells . The results revealed the 34 importance of the Ras - related protein Rab18 and syntaxin 18 for BKPyV infection . Our subsequent 35 experiments implicated additional factors that interact with this pathway , and suggest a more detailed 36 model of the intracellular trafficking process , indicating that BKPyV reaches the ER lumen through a 37 retrograde transport pathway between the late endosome and the ER . 38 39 Keywords 40 41 siRNA screen , Rab18 , syntaxin 18 , NRZ complex , BKPyV 42 43 44 45 .

Subsequent serology surveys have revealed that up to 80 % of the 48 world ' s population has been infected with BKPyV ( 2 ) , and most of the initial infections occur in early 49 childhood ( 3 ) . After initial exposure , BKPyV establishes an asymptomatic infection in the urinary tract 50 with periodic shedding into the urine ( 4 ) . BKPyV reactivation when the immune system is compromised 51 in transplant patients , however , causes two diseases : polyomavirus - associated nephropathy ( PVAN ) and 52 hemorrhagic cystitis ( HC ) ( 5 ) . PVAN is one of the leading causes of graft failure after kidney 53 transplantation ( 6 ) . Also , BKPyV can be detected in the urine of 90 % of allogeneic hematopoietic cell 54 transplant patients who suffer from HC , according to a recent study ( 7 ) . Even though BKPyV was initially 55 isolated more than 45 years ago , the choices for clinical management of BKPyV reactivation are limited . 56 The first - line treatment for PVAN is lowering the dosage of immunosuppressants , which inevitably 57 increases the risk of acute rejection and graft failure ( 6 ) . Other options for treating BKPyV reactivation 58 are treatment with cidofovir , leflunomide , and fluoroquinolones ; however , the benefit of using these 59 drugs in addition to reducing immunosuppressants has been questioned and has not been investigated 60 carefully in randomized studies ( 6 , 8 ) . Due to the lack of specific antiviral medicines , management of 61 BKPyV reactivation remains a challenge . 62 BKPyV does not encode any polymerases . As a result , BKPyV exclusively relies on the host DNA 63 replication machinery for its genome replication . To establish a successful infection , BKPyV must deliver 64 its DNA genome into the nucleus to access the host DNA replication machinery , which means crossing 65 the plasma membrane , the ER membrane , and the nuclear envelope ( 9 ) . Also , BKPyV needs to navigate 66 a crowded cytoplasm to reach the ER . Without any cooperation from host factors , this process would 67 seem difficult if not impossible . 68 Few host factors have previously been identified that participate in viral entry and intracellular 69 trafficking . To initiate infection , BKPyV binds to gangliosides GD1b or GT1b on the host cell 70 membrane ( 10 ) . After binding to the cell membrane , BKPyV had been thought to enter host cells via a 71 caveolin - mediated pathway ( 11 ) , however , subsequent experiments showed that caveolin was 72 dispensable for infecting human renal proximal tubule cells ( 12 ) . After endocytosis , BKPyV enters the 73 endosome in the same way as other polyomaviruses ( 13 - 16 ) . The acidification and maturation of the 74 endosome are essential for BKPyV infection ( 17 ) , and activates a sorting machinery that involves Rab5 , 75 Rab7 , Rab9 , and Rab11 proteins ( 14 , 15 , 18 ) . After sorting through the late endosome , vesicles that 76 . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

ER 77 lumen proteins are essential for polyomavirus disassembly and egress from the ER ( 9 , 17 , 20 - 22 ) . Briefly , 78 protein disulfide isomerases induce capsid conformational changes and minor capsid protein exposure 79 ( 17 , 23 - 28 ) . These exposed minor proteins insert into the ER membrane ( 29 , 30 ) , and partially 80 disassembled polyomaviruses penetrate the ER membrane and enter the cytosol through the 81 endoplasmic reticulum - associated degradation pathway ( 9 , 20 , 21 , 31 , 32 ) . In the cytosol , the nuclear 82 localization signal of the minor capsid proteins guides polyomaviruses into the nucleus via the importin 83 α / β pathway ( 33 - 35 ) . In addition to this productive model of entry , a significant portion of internalized 84 polyomavirus enters a non - productive pathway ( 36 ) . Distinguishing the critical events that BKPyV takes 85 to establish successful infection from other pathways that BKPyV takes remains a challenge . 86 Numerous assays have been developed for the purpose of identifying host factors associated with viral 87 infections , including genome - wide siRNA screening . By silencing every single human gene with an siRNA 88 pool , and then assessing the effects of the knockdown on infection , it is feasible to dissect the functions 89 of individual host proteins during the viral life cycle . siRNA screening has been extensively applied to 90 research on viruses , such as HIV ( 37 ) , West Nile Virus ( 38 ) , HPV ( 39 ) , VSV ( 40 ) , and another 91 polyomavirus , SV40 ( 41 ) . However , no genome - wide siRNA screen has been reported for BKPyV . 92 Using a whole genome siRNA screen , we have identified a series of potential host factors that are 93 involved in BKPyV infection . DNAJ B14 , which has previously been implicated in BKPyV entry , is our top 94 hit , and DNAJ B12 is also among our top 100 hits ( 21 , 41 ) . Most of the other hits we have identified have 95 not been previously reported , however , and many of them are involved in vesicular transport . In this 96 report , we present data showing that two of our primary hits , Rab18 and syntaxin 18 , as well as two 97 members of the NRZ complex ( RAD50 interactor 1 and ZW10 kinetochore protein ) , which have 98 previously been shown to interact with Rab18 and syntaxin 18 , are essential host factors for BKPyV 99 infection . 100 Results 101 A high - throughput siRNA screen on BKPyV based on cell cycle analysis 102 To identify host factors involved in viral entry and intracellular trafficking , we developed and 103 implemented a high - throughput whole - genome siRNA screen for BKPyV infection in its natural host cell , 104 primary human renal proximal tubule epithelial ( RPTE ) cells . In this screen , BKPyV infection was 105 challenged with the Dharmacon siGENOME Smartpool siRNA library , which includes more than 18 , 000 106 .

Each pool contains four unique siRNAs that target the same host gene . The screen 107 was performed in triplicate . Every screen plate included the siGENOME non - targeting control ( NTC ) as a 108 negative control and a synthetic siRNA which corresponds to the natural BKPyV 5p miRNA targeting the 109 large tumor antigen ( TAg ) mRNA ( siTAg ) ( 42 ) , as a positive control . 110 Our lab previously showed that BKPyV induces G2 / M arrest to take full advantage of the host DNA 111 replication machinery ( 43 ) ; this provided us with a cost - efficient approach to evaluate viral infection in 112 siRNA - transfected cells . By applying a Hoechst DNA stain , cells in G2 / M phase are distinguishable from 113 the rest of the cells based on the difference in DNA content in each nucleus . The percentage of G2 / M 114 arrested cells ( G2 % ) dramatically increases after BKPyV infection , and we adopted it as the readout for 115 the screening assay . 116 For the primary screen , RPTE cells were transfected with the siRNA library and cultured for 48 hours to 117 allow depletion of the targeted proteins . Next , cells were infected with BKPyV and cultured for an 118 additional two days . The cells were fixed and stained with Hoechst , and the numbers of nuclei in the 119 different stages of the cell cycle were quantified , recorded , and uploaded to the MScreen web tool 120 developed by the Center for Chemical Genomics ( University of Michigan ) ( 44 ) . G2 % values were 121 calculated using the MScreen web tool . To proceed with the data analysis , we scaled data from 0 to 100 , 122 with 100 representing the effect of our positive control , and 0 representing the effect of negative 123 control . The effect of each siRNA pool was then calculated using this index scale . A larger index value 124 represents a stronger inhibitory effect on the BKPyV infection when an siRNA pool is introduced into 125 RPTE cells , which suggests that the targeted host factor is more likely to be required for BKPyV infection . 126 Z - factor is a statistical parameter widely used for screen assay evaluation . A minimal Z - factor of 0 . 5 is 127 required for a reliable siRNA screen ( 45 ) . The overall Z - factor achieved in our whole primary screen was 128 0 . 6 , and the R - squared values were approximately 0 . 9 between replicates . We compared the data from 129 the three replicates in as pairwise manner , as illustrated in the scatter plots in Figure 1 . 70 % of the 130 siRNA pools in the siGENOME siRNA library inhibited BKPyV infection to some degree when compared to 131 the non - targeting siRNA control . A similar distribution of inhibitory effects was also observed in an siRNA 132 screen using the siGENOME library to assess cellular genes involved in HPV infection ( 39 ) . The results of 133 the primary screen are in Supplemental Table 1 , Sheet1 . 134 We parsed the candidate genes into functional categories and pathways using the Database for 135 Annotation , Visualization , and Integrated Discovery ( DAVID ) enrichment analysis tool ( 46 , 47 ) .

Considering that 138 BKPyV exclusively relies on the host protein synthesis machinery , this result is consistent with our 139 expectation . Other than translation - related genes , several clusters of genes that are required for viral 140 infection were also significantly enriched , especially budding and coat proteins associated with vesicular 141 transport . Based on the enrichment analysis results , we manually selected 147 siRNA pools for 142 secondary validation . 143 G2 % is an indirect readout for BKPyV infection . Knocking down cell cycle regulatory proteins may also 144 affect G2 / M arrest independent of viral infection ; thus false positive or false negative candidates could 145 be introduced into the results during the primary screen . To eliminate these false candidates , we next 146 applied a direct readout , immunofluorescent staining for the early viral protein TAg , to validate these 147 147 genes . RPTE cells were transfected and infected in 96 well plates with a subset of the siGENOME 148 library that contains the selected 147 siRNA pools . Infected cells were fixed at 48 hours post infection 149 and probed for TAg with primary antibody and FITC - labeled secondary antibody . After acquiring images , 150 the integrated TAg fluorescent intensity per nucleus was recorded , and the inhibition index was 151 calculated as in the primary screen ( Supplemental Table 2 ) . 152 After the secondary screen , DNAJ B14 , which has previously been implicated in BKPyV entry , was our 153 top hit , and DNAJ B12 and DNAJC3 , which are also involved in polyomavirus trafficking , were also among 154 our top ten hits ( 21 , 41 ) , which indicates the overall robustness of our screen . Rab18 was one of our top 155 validated hits other than these DNAJ proteins . Moreover , syntaxin 18 , a protein that has previously been 156 demonstrated to interact with Rab18 , also passed our validation . 157 158 The Rab18 / NRZ / syntaxin 18 complex is required for BKPyV infection 159 The Rab protein family is a group of small GTPases that regulate membrane trafficking , and that have 160 been implicated in polyomavirus intracellular trafficking ( 14 , 18 , 48 ) . Rab18 , however , had not 161 previously been associated with polyomavirus infection . The Rab18 interaction network has been 162 thoroughly investigated ( 49 ) , and more than 40 proteins have been identified as interacting with Rab18 . 163 Among these proteins , syntaxin 18 was also one of our top hits in the screen . 164 To determine whether Rab18 and syntaxin 18 are required during BKPyV infection , RPTE cells in 12 well 165 plates were transfected with pooled or individual siRNAs targeting these proteins .

After transfection , 167 cells were cultured for two days to allow for depletion of the targeted proteins , and then infected with 168 BKPyV at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 1 infectious unit ( IU ) / cell . Cells were lysed at 48 hours post 169 infection , and expression of the targeted proteins , TAg , and β - actin or glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate 170 dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) were assessed by Western blotting ( Figure 2A ) . The choice of β - actin or GAPDH 171 was based on avoiding co - migration of the loading control with the protein of interest . Knockdown of 172 Rab18 and syntaxin 18 reduced TAg expression , indicating that both proteins are required for efficient 173 infection . Knockdown of Rab18 entirely blocked BKPyV infection . While there was only partial 174 knockdown of syntaxin 18 with both the pooled or individual siRNAs , TAg expression decreased 175 correspondingly . Because syntaxin 18 is a SNARE protein ( 50 ) , this suggests that BKPyV enters the ER 176 lumen via a vesicle fusion step . 177 In addition to syntaxin 18 , Rab18 interacts with ZW10 kinetochore protein ( ZW10 ) and RAD50 Interactor 178 1 ( RINT1 ) , which together with neuroblastoma amplified gene ( NAG ) are members of the NRZ complex 179 ( 51 ) . Upon activation by GTP , Rab18 interacts with the ZW10 kinetochore protein from the NRZ 180 complex , thereby forming a Rab18 / NRZ / syntaxin 18 complex at the ER ( 49 ) . In this complex , syntaxin 18 181 functions as a t - SNARE on the ER membrane where the NRZ components work as a tether to assist with 182 retrograde vesicle docking ( 51 , 52 ) . NRZ / syntaxin 18 cooperate in capturing Rab18 - labeled vesicles and 183 initiating the fusion process on the ER membrane . Although none of the NRZ complex proteins were 184 identified in our primary screen , we hypothesized that they are required for BKPyV infection due to their 185 ability to interact with both Rab18 and syntaxin 18 . To test whether NRZ components are involved in 186 BKPyV infection , we knocked down RINT1 and ZW10 , followed by infection . We could not test NAG due 187 to lack of a useful antibody to measure its expression . The Western blot results indicate that disrupting 188 the NRZ complex by knocking down these two components interferes with infection ( Figure 2B ) . 189 190 Rab18 colocalizes with the viral capsid during BKPyV intracellular trafficking 191 We next asked whether Rab18 is associated with BKPyV - containing vesicles , since Rab18 targets vesicles 192 to the ER ( 53 , 54 ) . To test this , we fixed RPTE cells at 6 and 8 hours post - infection and stained for the 193 BKPyV major capsid protein , VP1 , and Rab18 . Images of the stained RPTE cells were acquired with a 194 confocal microscope . The confocal images show that Rab18 and VP1 are partially colocalized at 6 and 8 195 hours post - infection ( Figure 3 ) . This is consistent with the asynchronous trafficking of BKPyV from 196 .

These results support our hypothesis that BKPyV travels in Rab18 - positive 197 vesicles after being sorted through endosomes . 198 199 BKPyV traffics differently after Rab18 , syntaxin 18 , or NRZ knockdown 200 To establish a successful infection , BKPyV must reach the ER lumen where disassembly occurs ( 17 ) . After 201 internalization into host cells , conformational changes of the capsid are neither required nor observed 202 before polyomaviruses enter the ER lumen ( 27 , 28 ) . When polyomavirus particles reach the ER lumen , 203 luminal enzymes disrupt the disulfide bonds between VP1 monomers , thereby initiating disassembly of 204 the viral capsid ( 26 ) . This process in the ER can be visualized by assaying for VP1 monomer , dimer , and 205 oligomer bands after separation of proteins under non - reducing conditions by SDS - PAGE ( 17 , 28 ) . To 206 confirm that BKPyV requires Rab18 to reach the ER lumen and initiate disassembly , we examined BKPyV 207 disassembly after Rab18 knockdown . RPTE cells were transfected with NTC or Rab18 siRNA for 48 hours 208 and infected with BKPyV at MOI 5 . Protein samples were processed and assayed at 24 hours post 209 infection using Western blotting of reducing and non - reducing gels ( 17 , 28 ) . At 0 hours post infection , 210 most of the BKPyV particles were intact and too large to enter the non - reducing SDS - PAGE gel , and no 211 VP1 monomers ( 42 kDa ) or dimers were visible . At 24 hours post infection in cells in which Rab18 was 212 present , BKPyV began to disassemble , and VP1 monomers , dimers , and oligomers could be detected . 213 However , the non - reducing gel suggests that the BKPyV particle could not disassemble efficiently 214 without Rab18 ( Figure 4A , top panel ) . The reducing gel shows that equal amounts of VP1 are detectable 215 in the presence or absence of Rab18 , indicating that knocking down Rab18 did not prevent BKPyV from 216 attaching to or entering RPTE cells . We also assessed the effect of knocking down RINT1 , ZW10 , and 217 syntaxin 18 on BKPyV disassembly ( Figure 4A , bottom panel ) . In each case , lower amounts of VP1 218 monomers and dimers were detected in the non - reducing gel , suggesting that BKPyV cannot 219 disassemble efficiently without the help of the NRZ complex . 220 Previous studies showed that mouse polyomavirus ( MPyV ) could enter cells that do not produce proper 221 ganglioside receptors ; afterward , these MPyV particles are trapped in a dead - end pathway and cannot 222 establish a successful infection . This indicates that polyomaviruses enter both productive and non - 223 productive pathways inside host cells . These non - productive pathways result in a diffuse distribution of 224 viral particles as detected by immunofluorescent staining ( 36 ) . In the presence of proper ganglioside 225 receptors , polyomaviruses leave the cell periphery , move along microtubules , and reach the perinuclear 226 .

Ultimately , the productive pathway leads to the ER ( 17 , 28 , 57 ) . Since we saw that 227 BKPyV could not reach the ER lumen without Rab18 while the entry of BKPyV was not affected ( Figure 228 4A ) , we wished to address if BKPyV traffics in a different pattern under Rab18 knockdown . To test this , 229 Rab18 was depleted as previously described , and RPTE cells were infected with BKPyV at MOI of 5 . Cells 230 were fixed and stained for VP1 at 24 hours post infection ( Figure 4B ) . In the presence of Rab18 , BKPyV 231 forms bright foci in the perinuclear area as previously observed ( 9 ) . However , Rab18 knockdown caused 232 dispersion of the bright perinuclear VP1 foci , and the staining of VP1 appeared to be diffuse and spread 233 throughout the cytoplasm ( Figure 4B ) . Thus , without Rab18 BKPyV traffics in a pattern that is suggestive 234 of a non - productive pathway ( 36 ) . 235 236 BKPyV is enriched in the late endosome without Rab18 . 237 Our previous study demonstrated that acidification of the endosome is essential for BKPyV infection 238 ( 17 ) , and MPyV colocalizes with the late endosome marker Rab7 after entry ( 18 ) . Furthermore , BKPyV 239 cannot traffic efficiently to the ER and initiate capsid disassembly without abundant Rab18 and instead 240 appears to be trapped in an unknown compartment ( s ) diffusely located in the cytoplasm ( Figure 4 ) . To 241 identify this compartment , we knocked down Rab18 in RPTE cells , fixed cells at 24 hours post infection , 242 and probed for various organelle markers ( Figure 5 ) . We found that the diffuse viral particles do not 243 colocalize with the early endosome marker EEA1 , cis - Golgi marker GM130 ( 58 ) , or trans - Golgi marker 244 Golgin 97 ( 59 ) . On the other hand , we found that the VP1 - rich area overlaps with Rab7 . To further 245 confirm this colocalization , images of VP1 and Rab7 were taken using confocal microscopy ( Figure 6 ) . 246 We found that the dispersed VP1 partially colocalizes with Rab7 when Rab18 is knocked down , 247 suggesting some viral particles are trapped in the late endosome in the absence of Rab18 . There is also 248 some VP1 that does not colocalize with Rab7 . This may be a result of asynchronous trafficking of BKPyV , 249 and additional intermediate and dead - end compartments could also exist during the retrograde 250 trafficking step between the endosome and the ER . Our results suggest that BKPyV reaches ER lumen 251 through a Rab18 - mediated retrograde transport pathway between the late endosome and the ER . 252 253 Discussion 254 BK polyomavirus ( BKPyV ) was initially isolated more than 45 years ago ( 1 ) , however , our understanding 255 of the early events in the BKPyV life cycle contains gaps . Polyomaviruses appear to take advantage of 256 . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

However , some of the pathways that BKPyV uses are 257 non - productive ( 36 ) , which suggests that identifying host factors solely by morphological observations , 258 especially protein co - localization evidence , may be deceiving . SV40 , BKPyV , MPyV , and cholera toxin 259 have been observed to enter the cell via a caveolin - mediated pathway ( 11 , 60 - 64 ) . However , subsequent 260 experiments have demonstrated that caveolin is dispensable ( 12 , 14 , 65 - 68 ) . Because of the limitations 261 of the available biological tools , research of the earliest stages of the polyomavirus life cycle has 262 progressed relatively slowly . 263 Whole genome siRNA screening provides an unbiased tool to investigate some of the remaining 264 questions . However , one of the biggest challenges of developing an siRNA screen assay is finding a 265 readout that is sensitive , cost efficient , and suitable for high throughput automation . One of the most 266 common readouts for a viral siRNA screen is cell viability . However , BKPyV , along with many viruses , 267 does not lyse host cells within a reasonable period compared to the duration of the RNAi effect in cells . 268 This behavior of BKPyV makes cell viability measurements impractical . Another common strategy to 269 evaluate viral infection is by incorporating reporter genes into the viral genome . Because BKPyV is highly 270 sensitive to genomic modification , several approaches attempting to integrate reporter genes into the 271 BKPyV genome have failed ( data not shown ) . Therefore , constructing modified viral particles containing 272 a reporter gene was not practical for us . Finally , immunofluorescent staining for viral protein expression 273 is neither cost - nor time - efficient for processing hundreds of plates . For all these reasons , we needed a 274 different readout for evaluating viral infection . 275 The percentage of cells in G2 / M phase provided us a cost - efficient assay for the primary screen . Our 276 primary screen results indicated that knocking down 70 % of the human genes in RPTE cells inhibited 277 BKPyV infection to some degree when compared to the non - targeting control . A similar data distribution 278 was also observed in an siRNA screen for HPV infection using the same siRNA library ( 39 ) . We found that 279 the NTC siRNA reproducibly slightly increased BKPyV infection compared to the no siRNA control . This 280 could be because of interference of exogenous siRNA with the host intrinsic miRNA processing and 281 silencing mechanism . BKPyV encodes a miRNA that downregulates TAg mRNA levels ( 42 , 69 ) . If the 282 introduction of exogenous siRNA affects the miRNA processing and silencing mechanism , TAg expression 283 would increase due to lower levels of the mature BKPyV miRNA . 284 The increased BKPyV infection induced by the non - targeting siRNA control could also be an off - target 285 effect of RNAi . While validating our primary screening results , we found many of our primary hits were 286 not reproducible when tested with individual siRNAs instead of siRNA pools . It appears that off - target 287 . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

The most likely cause of the off - target effect is the passenger strand of the siRNA . 289 Each siRNA carries a complimentary strand ( passenger strand ) to enhance the stability of the siRNA 290 molecules . This passenger strand can also be integrated into the RNA - induced silencing complex ( RISC ) , 291 which possibly increases off - target effects . Moreover , even if only the guide strand enters the RISC 292 complex , RISC prefers the 2nd to the 8th nucleotides of that strand , called the seed region , to recognize 293 targeted mRNAs ( 70 - 74 ) . Considering this characteristic of RNAi , each seven - nucleotide seed region can 294 target more than one gene . Off - target effects can therefore increase the expense of validation and 295 lower the efficiency of screening . 296 After validating some of the top hits as well as other genes that are known to be involved in the same 297 vesicular trafficking pathway , Rab18 , syntaxin 18 , ZW10 , and RINT1 were confirmed as essential host 298 factors for BKPyV infection . Rab18 has been associated with lipid droplet homeostasis and vesicular 299 transport between the Golgi apparatus and the ER ( 53 , 54 ) . The majority of Rab18 usually localizes to 300 the membrane of the ER and the cis - Golgi apparatus ( 53 ) . Also , Rab18 is recruited to the surface of lipid 301 droplets , the endosome , and the lysosome ( 75 , 76 ) . Rab18 has been shown to interact with syntaxin 18 , 302 ZW10 , and RINT1 by affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry ( 49 ) . Based on previous 303 studies on yeast proteins , ZW10 and RINT1 interact with each other via their N - termini and interact with 304 the NAG protein to form the NRZ complex . The t - SNARE protein syntaxin 18 on the ER membrane 305 indirectly attaches to the NRZ complex ( 51 , 52 , 77 ) . The overall structure of the NRZ complex is a 306 protrusion about 20 nm in length from the surface of the ER membrane ( 78 ) . GTP - activated Rab18 on 307 the surface of vesicles interacts with ZW10 , thereby tethering vesicles to the ER membrane . Syntaxin 18 308 is a SNARE protein and mediates vesicle fusion to the ER ( 50 ) . After the NRZ complex captures vesicles , 309 syntaxin 18 mediates vesicle fusion with the ER membrane . 310 We propose a model of BKPyV entry and intracellular trafficking to the ER based on previous findings 311 and our current results ( Figure 7 ) . To initiate infection , BKPyV first binds to its ganglioside receptors 312 GT1b and GD1b ( 10 ) . After initial attachment , BKPyV is believed to form deep invaginations of the host 313 plasma membrane in the same manner as SV40 ( 79 ) . The length of ceramide tails of the ganglioside 314 plays a critical role in formation of the invagination ( 79 ) . Next , BKPyV enters host cells via a ganglioside - 315 dependent , caveolin - and clathrin - independent pathway ( 12 , 80 ) . Meanwhile , glycoproteins on the 316 plasma membrane appear to serve as traps for polyomavirus ( 81 ) : viral particles that bind to 317 glycoproteins will eventually enter non - productive pathways . Only those particles that bind to the 318 . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

Furthermore , binding to 319 the gangliosides is sufficient to drive transport of artificial particles to the ER ( 18 ) . This indicates that 320 binding to the proper ganglioside is both necessary and sufficient for BKPyV to traffic in retrograde 321 transport vesicles to the ER . In addition , conformational changes of the capsid are neither required nor 322 observed before polyomaviruses enter the ER lumen ( 27 , 28 ) . These findings reveal that BKPyV may 323 remain bound to the membrane throughout the intracellular trafficking until reaching the ER lumen . 324 BKPyV enters the endosome in the same manner as other polyomaviruses ( 13 - 15 ) . Acidification of the 325 endosome activates a ganglioside - sorting machinery that sorts BKPyV into secondary vesicles along with 326 gangliosides ( 17 , 18 , 82 ) . Without Rab18 , we found that BKPyV accumulates in the late endosome 327 ( marked by Rab7 ) . This suggests that Rab18 mediates late endosome to ER trafficking of BKPyV and that 328 it buds and traffics together with virus - containing vesicles along microtubules ( 17 , 19 , 55 , 83 ) . After the 329 NRZ complex on the ER membrane captures and tethers vesicles to the ER surface , syntaxin 18 further 330 interacts with a yet to be identified v - SNARE on the vesicles , and the syntaxin 18 / v - SNARE complex 331 mediates vesicle fusion to the ER membrane . This allows successful entry of BKPyV into the ER lumen . 332 Our finding supports the conclusion that late endosome to ER trafficking plays a critical role in BKPyV 333 infection . 334 It has been shown that fluorescently labeled gangliosides can spontaneously transport in a retrograde 335 direction to the ER ( 77 ) . BKPyV and the other polyomaviruses are therefore like hitchhikers that take a 336 ride along this ganglioside - mediated retrograde pathway to the ER . Whether additional interactions 337 between the viral capsid and host proteins play a role in BKPyV trafficking to the ER is still unclear . 338 Gangliosides play important roles in both endocytosis and retrograde trafficking . Polyomaviruses and 339 several toxins are proposed to take advantage of lipid - mediated endocytosis and retrograde trafficking 340 pathways ( reviewed by Ewers and Helenius ( 80 ) ) . Beside polyomaviruses , some other non - enveloped 341 viruses infect cells in a similar manner ; therefore , they may also utilize part of this lipid - mediated 342 retrograde trafficking pathway to establish an infection ( 84 ) : The retrograde paths of both HPV and 343 BKPyV can be blocked with retrograde traffic inhibitors retro - 1 , retro - 2 , and BFA ( 17 , 39 , 85 , 86 ) . 344 Norovirus also binds to gangliosides ( 87 , 88 ) , and forms deep invaginations on model membranes ( 89 ) . 345 Gangliosides have been demonstrated to be important for rotavirus infection ( 90 ) , and rotavirus also 346 traffics to and is sorted through the endosome ( 91 ) . However , details of the Rab18 - mediated pathway 347 are largely unknown , and further efforts will be needed to fully reveal the details of this retrograde 348 trafficking pathway . 349 .
