The lattices of clathrin - coated pits and vesicles are comprised of triskelions , each consisting of three oligomerized heavy chains ( HC ) bound by a light chain ( LC ) . In addition to binding HC , LC interacts with members of the Hip1 / R family of endocytic proteins , including the budding yeast homologue , Sla2p . Here , using in vivo analysis in yeast , we provide novel insight into the role of this interaction . We ﬁnd that overexpression of LC partially restores endocytosis to cells lacking clathrin HC . This suppression is dependent on the Sla2p binding region of LC . Using live cell imaging techniques to visualize endocytic vesicle formation , we ﬁnd that the N - terminal Sla2p binding region of LC promotes the progression of arrested Sla2p patches that form in the absence of HC . We propose that LC binding to Sla2p positively regulates Sla2p for efﬁcient endocytic vesicle formation . INTRODUCTION Clathrin is a major vesicle coat protein that is important for receptor - mediated endocytosis and sorting of cargo at the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) and endosomal system ( re - viewed in Brodsky et al . , 2001 ) . Clathrin heavy chain ( HC ) monomers oligomerize into triskelions containing three ra - dially extended legs , each with an associated clathrin light chain ( LC ) . The central region of LC binds the HC proximal leg ( Scarmato and Kirchhausen , 1990 ; Chen et al . , 2002 ) , whereas the C - terminus of LC is oriented toward the HC trimerization domain ( Fotin et al . , 2004 ) . Studies from yeast indicate that LCs are indeed important for efﬁcient HC tri - merization ( Chu et al . , 1996 ; Huang et al . , 1997 ) . LCs may also regulate the assembly of clathrin lattices , as addition of LC to free HC trimers or recombinant HC hub fragments inhibits their spontaneous assembly ( Ungewickell and Ungewickell , 1991 ; Liu et al . , 1995 ) . This effect depends on acidic residues in an N - terminal conserved region in LC ( Ybe et al . , 1998 ) . The same region of LC also interacts with the central coiled - coil domain of the Hip1 / R family of actin - binding endocytic proteins ( Chen and Brodsky , 2005 ; Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2005 ) . Binding of Hip1 / R to clathrin LC is required for them to promote clathrin assembly in vitro ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ; Chen and Brodsky , 2005 ; Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , it is hypothesized that Hip1 / R promote clath - rin assembly by releasing LC’s inhibition of lattice assem - bly ( Chen and Brodsky , 2005 ; Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2005 ) . Hip1 family members also interact with phosphati - dyl - inositol lipid through an N - terminal ANTH domain and F - actin through a talin - Hip1 / R / Sla2p actin - tethering C - terminal homology ( THATCH ) domain , suggesting that these proteins also serve to coordinate the actin cytoskel - eton at clathrin - coated pits ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ; Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2002 ; Hyun et al . , 2004 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ; Sun et al . , 2005 ) . In vivo studies in yeast are beginning to elucidate the rela - tionship between clathrin and the Hip1 / R homologue , Sla2p , during endocytosis . Kinetic studies of ﬂuorescently labeled endocytic proteins have identiﬁed multiple stages of protein recruitment during vesicle internalization ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ; Newpher et al . , 2005 ; Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ; Toshima et al . , 2006 ) . Initially , clathrin and Ede1p , an Eps15 homology ( EH ) domain protein , are recruited to the cell cortex and are later joined by Sla2p . These are then followed by other early stage endocytic factors such as the SH3 domain protein Sla1p and the EH domain factors Pan1p and End3p . In addi - tion , cargo recruitment to endocytic patches occurs after Ede1p arrival , but before Sla1p ( Toshima et al . , 2006 ) . In the later stages , Abp1p , actin , and Arp2 / 3 complex are recruited , which coincides with membrane invagination . Finally , early stage factors uncoat and there is a rapid inward movement of the Abp1p / actin - associated endocytic vesicle into the cell . Studies investigating the function of Sla2p during endo - cytic patch formation found in sla2 (cid:1) cells , early stage endo - cytic factors including clathrin , epsins , AP180s , Sla1p , Pan1p , and Las17p all accumulate in arrested cortical patches , whereas Abp1p and actin develop into comet tails that plume inward from the cortex ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; New - pher et al . , 2005 ) .

In addition , these data demonstrate that Sla2p is not necessary to pro - mote clathrin assembly at endocytic sites in vivo ( Newpher et al . , 2005 ) . Conversely , we have shown that clathrin is important for progression of Sla2p containing endocytic patches . Clathrin mutants have normal numbers of endo - cytic patches containing Sla2p , but many never internalize or they have abnormally long lifetimes before progression to the actin driven invagination stage , and they periodically produce actin comet tails ( Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ) . Furthermore , for arrested Sla2p patches that do ultimately internalize , there is a dramatic delay in recruitment of other early endocytic factors ( e . g . , Sla1p ) , and the actin phase is slowed . These defects suggest that clathrin has an organiza - tional role in forming endocytic sites and / or it promotes the progression of Sla2p - containing early patches . In this article we investigate the role of LC in progression of Sla2p patches . Our previous work showed that yeast LC interacts with the Sla2p coiled - coil domain , like its mamma - lian counterparts ( Henry et al . , 2002 , Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ) . Here we gain new insight into the role of this inter - action . We ﬁnd that binding of the N - terminal domain of LC to Sla2p promotes progression of early endocytic structures to the invagination stage of vesicle internalization . METHODS AND MATERIALS Strains and Growth Assays Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . YEPD and synthetic dropout medium were prepared as described in Newpher and Lemmon ( 2006 ) .

Plasmids from His (cid:2) Trp (cid:2) transformants were digested with NcoI to remove the His3MX6 cassette and self - ligated to generate the above truncation and deletion mutants . pTMN27 ( 2 (cid:1) , URA3 , clc1 - [ 77 - 233 ] ] , pTMN28 ( 2 (cid:1) , URA3 , clc1 - [ 1 - 143 ] ) , and pTMN29 ( 2 (cid:1) , URA3 , clc1 - [ 41 - 233 ] ) were generated by PvuII digestion of pTMN18 , pTMN20 , and pTMN19 , respectively , and gap repairing into BamHI - cut pRS426 ( 2 (cid:1) , URA3 ) . pTMN42 was made by integrating the His3MX6 cassette ﬂanked by NcoI sites directly after the CLC1 start codon of pKH1 . The His3MX6 cassette was removed by digestion with NcoI and religation . pTMN44 ( CEN , TRP1 , GFP - clc1 [ - 77 - 233 ] ) was made by PCR am - plifying the GFP - coding sequence from pFA6a - GFP ( S65T ) - TRP1 ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ) with ends upstream of the CLC1 start codon and downstream of the truncation sequence and gap repairing into NcoI - cut pTMN42 . pTMN48 ( CEN , TRP1 , GFP - clc1 - [ 1 - 143 : HIS3Mx6 ] ) was made by integrating a stop codon into pTMN17 ( CEN , TRP1 , GFP - CLC1 ) after codon 143 using the His3MX6 cassette ampliﬁed from pFA6a - His3MX6 .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 4344 RESULTS Overexpression of LC Partially Suppresses the Endocytic Defect of Clathrin HC - deﬁcient Cells Previously we identiﬁed the clathrin LC gene , CLC1 , as a multicopy suppressor of the growth defects of clathrin HC – deﬁcient yeast ( Nelson and Lemmon , 1993 ; Huang et al . , 1997 ) . Although LC overexpression suppressed growth , it did not suppress the TGN sorting defects of chc1 (cid:1) cells ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) . It has since remained a mystery how the clathrin LC could function in the complete absence of HC . Because yeast LC , like its mammalian counterparts , interacts directly with the Sla2p coiled - coil domain ( Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ) , we tested whether LC was suppressing the endocytic phenotype of clathrin - deﬁcient yeast . We found that LC overexpression partially suppressed the (cid:2) - factor internalization defect of chc1 (cid:1) cells ( Figure 1 ) . N - Terminus of LC Binds Sla2p and Partially Suppresses the Growth and Endocytic Defects of Clathrin HC – deﬁcient Cells To determine if the Sla2p - binding region is responsible for LC suppression of chc1 (cid:1) endocytic defects , GST pulldowns using bacterially expressed protein were performed to map the regions of yeast LC that bind Sla2p and HC . 6xHis - tagged N - and C - terminal deletion constructs of Clc1p were ﬁrst incubated with GST fused to the HC proximal region ( GST - Chc1p - [ 1062 - 1653 ] , Figure 2 , A and B ) . Deletion of the ﬁrst 18 ( Clclp - [ 19 - 233 ] ) , 40 ( Clc1p - [ 41 - 233 ] ) , or 76 ( Clc1p - [ 77 - 233 ] ) residues of LC did not prevent the interaction with the clathrin HC proximal domain ( GST - Chc1p - [ 1062 - 1653 ] ) ; however , deletion of the last 78 residues of Clc1p ( Clc1p - [ 77 - 155 ] or Clc1p - [ 1 - 155 ] ) , which removes most of the pos - tulated C - terminal HC - binding region , prevented HC inter - action ( Figure 2 , A and B ) . The same 6xHis - tagged Clc1p truncations were tested for binding to GST - Sla2p - [ 289 - 583 ] , which contains the Sla2p coiled - coil domain , previously shown to bind full - length LC ( Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ) , like its mammalian counter - parts ( Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2002 ) . The ﬁrst 18 residues of Clc1p were not required for Sla2p binding ; however , Figure 1 . LC overexpression suppresses the (cid:2) - factor internaliza - tion defect of chc1 (cid:1) cells . MAT a chc1 (cid:1) bar1 - 1 ( SL3593 ) was trans - formed with YEp24 - CHC1 ( CHC1 , 2 (cid:1) ) , pKH2 ( CLC1 , 2 (cid:1) ) , or pRS426 ( empty 2 (cid:1) ) . (cid:2) - factor uptake was analyzed as described in Materials and Methods . Figure 2 . The N - terminus of LC ( residues 19 – 76 ) in - teracts directly with the Sla2p coiled - coil domain . ( A ) 6xHis - Clc1p truncation mutants used for pulldown ex - periments and summary of interactions with HC or Sla2p . LC contains an N - terminal conserved sequence ( 22 – 38 ) , a calcium - binding EF - Hand motif ( 80 – 91 ) , an HC - binding region ( 144 – 194 ) , and a calmodulin - bind - ing site ( 212 – 225 ) . ( B ) 6xHis tagged Clc1p truncations were used in pulldowns with GST - Chc1p - proximal leg residues [ 1062 – 1653 ] ( middle panel ) and GST - Sla2p - cc residues [ 289 – 583 ] ( right panel ) and immunoblotted with the indicated primary antibodies . The left panel shows input of 6xHis - Clc1p constructs . Clathrin LC Function during Endocytosis Vol . 17 , October 2006 4345 deletion of the ﬁrst 40 residues of Clc1p strongly reduced the interaction , whereas deletion of amino acids 1 – 76 com - pletely eliminated binding ( Figure 2 , A and B ) . Importantly , Clc1p - [ 1 - 155 ] maintained its interaction with Sla2p , showing that the N - terminus of LC is necessary and sufﬁcient for Sla2p interaction . These results demonstrate that the region involved in Sla2p interaction is within amino acids 19 – 76 of Clc1p ( Figure 2A ) , which are separate from the HC - binding region of LC . We next tested the requirement of Sla2p - LC interaction for LC - mediated suppression of chc1 growth and endocytic de - fects . Similar to full - length LC , an N - terminal domain frag - ment of LC [ 1 - 143 ] , which does not bind to HC , also partially suppressed the growth defect of chc1 cells ( Figure 3A ) . How - ever , the LC alleles that remove all or portions of the Sla2p binding site ( Clc1p - [ 77 - 233 ] and Clc1p - [ 41 - 233 ] ) could not rescue growth ( Figure 3A ) , despite the higher level of ex - pression of Clc1p - [ 41 - 233 ] and Clc1 - [ 77 - 233 ] compared with Clc1p - [ 1 - 143 ] ( Figure 3C ) . Removal of Sla2p binding se - quences within the [ 1 - 143 ] fragment , ( Clc1p - [ 1 - 143 (cid:1) 20 - 76 ] , Clc1p - [ 1 - 143 (cid:1) 20 - 40 ] or Clc1p - [ 1 - 143 (cid:1) 41 - 76 ] ) also no longer rescued growth ( T . Newpher , unpublished data ) . In addition to growth suppression , the N - terminus of LC ( Clc1p - [ 1 - 143 ] ) , like full - length LC , partially rescued (cid:2) - factor internalization in chc1 (cid:1) cells , whereas similar overexpres - sion of the C - terminal HC - binding region ( Clc1p - [ 77 - 233 ] ) ( Figure 3B ) , which lacks the Sla2p binding site had no effect . These data demonstrate that the LC can partially function during endocytosis in the complete absence of clathrin HC , and this suppression requires the Sla2p binding region on LC , but not the HC - binding domain . The N - Terminal Sla2p - binding Region of LC Increases the Turnover Rate of Sla2p - containing Early Endocytic Patches in Clathrin Mutants To determine what stage of endocytosis is suppressed by LC overexpression , we followed the dynamics of Sla2p - GFP and Abp1 - mRFP in chc1 (cid:1) cells overexpressing full - length LC or the N - terminal Sla2p - binding fragment of LC [ 1 - 143 ] . As shown previously ( Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ) , clathrin mutants contain many immobile early endocytic patches labeled with Sla2p ( Figure 4 , C and D ) . Cells overexpressing Clc1p or Clc1p - [ 1 - 143 ] still contained different classes of Sla2p patches . However , the proportion of cells in which nearly all of the Sla2p - GFP patches were mobile increased from 38 % in chc1 (cid:1) with empty vector ( n (cid:7) 173 cells ) to 62 % when LC was overexpressed ( n (cid:7) 100 cells ) , compared with 100 % in chc1 (cid:1) cells complemented with CHC1 ( n (cid:7) 25 cells ; Figure 4C , Supplementary Movie S1 ) . Also , the percentage of cells containing mostly immobile Sla2p patches decreased from 35 % in chc1 (cid:1) with empty vector ( Figure 4C , empty ) to 5 % when LC was overexpressed ( Figure 4C ) . Similar changes were observed with the N - terminal Sla2p binding fragment of LC ( n (cid:7) 119 ) ( Figure 4C and Supplementary Movie 1 ) , but not with the HC binding region ( n (cid:7) 95 ; Figure 4C ; T . Newpher , unpublished observations ) . When only the mobile Sla2p - GFP patches were analyzed , we found that the average turnover rate was accelerated from 40 s in chc1 (cid:1) ( n (cid:7) 41 patch events ) to (cid:8) 28 s in cells overexpressing Clc1p or Clc1p - [ 1 - 143 ] ( Figure 4 , A and D ; note shorter patch lifetimes in kymographs , p (cid:9) 0 . 001 , n (cid:7) 60 and 90 patch events , respectively ) . In contrast , overexpression of the HC - binding region alone ( Clc1p - [ 77 - 233 ] ) had no effect on Sla2p patch lifetime ( n (cid:7) 25 patch events ; Figure 4 , A and D ) . In chc1 (cid:1) cells Abp1p - RFP patches that are recruited to mobile Sla2p patches have slowed lifetimes compared with wild type ( Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ) . This was not signiﬁcantly suppressed by overexpression of Clc1p - [ 1 - 143 ] ( Figure 4B , p (cid:10) 0 . 1 , n (cid:7) 30 patch events ) , but was sup - pressed by overexpression of Clc1p ( Figure 4B , p (cid:9) 0 . 001 , n (cid:7) 30 patch events ) . The actin comet tail defect seen in chc1 (cid:1) cells was present when overexpressing either LC ( n (cid:7) 55 cells ) or its N - terminal fragment ( n (cid:7) 44 cells ) , although it was less severe with full - length LC ( n (cid:7) 27 cells ; Figure 4 , C and D , arrows ) . These differences may be due to the higher level of protein expression for the full - length LC compared with Clc1p - [ 1 - 143 ] ( Figure 3C ) . Taken together , these data indicate that the N - terminus of clathrin LC partially sup - presses the endocytic phenotype of chc1 (cid:1) yeast through its direct interaction with Sla2p . In addition , the suppression by LC occurs during the early stage of endocytosis by acceler - ating Sla2p patch lifetime and increasing the proportion of cells in which all Sla2p patches are mobile . The N - Terminal Sla2p - binding Region of LC Partially Complements clc1 - deﬁcient Yeast We also tested the ability of Clc1p - [ 1 - 143 ] , Clc1p - [ 77 - 233 ] and Clc1p - [ 44 - 233 ] to complement the defects of LC - deﬁ - cient cells . All of the LC mutant proteins were expressed and could be detected by immunoblotting with anti - Clc1p anti - bodies ; however , Clc1p - [ 41 - 233 ] , Clc1p - [ 77 - 233 ] , and Clc1p - [ 1 - 143 ] were only detected at near normal levels by expres - sion from 2 (cid:1) plasmids ( Figure 5A ) . Cells expressing the less stable Clc1p - [ 41 - 233 ] and Clc1p - [ 77 - 233 ] were slightly tem - Figure 3 .

Newpher , unpublished observation ) , but showed normal WT growth at 37°C when expressed from 2 (cid:1) vectors ( Figure 5B ) . Expression of the LC N - terminal frag - ment ( Clc1p - [ 1 - 143 ] ) from a 2 (cid:1) plasmid also partially com - plemented growth at 37°C and improved it at 30°C when compared with clc1 (cid:1) with empty vector ( Figure 5B ) . These data indicate that that the LC N - terminal region can function independently of HC binding . To further test the effects of impairing LC’s ability to bind Sla2p or HC , clc1 - [ 77 - 233 ] , clc1 - [ 41 - 233 ] and clc1 - [ 1 - 143 ] were assayed for their ability to rescue the TGN sorting defect of clc1 (cid:1) cells . Wild - type MAT (cid:2) cells secrete the mature form of the mating pheromone (cid:2) - factor , whereas clathrin mutants secrete an inactive precursor form of (cid:2) - factor due to mislo - calization of pro - (cid:2) - factor processing enzymes , such as Kex2p , from the TGN to the cell surface ( Payne and Schekman , 1989 ) . Thus MAT (cid:2) clc1 (cid:1) or chc1 (cid:1) cells are not competent to arrest growth of MAT a cells in a halo assay ( Figure 5C ) . The N - terminal mutants that could bind HC but not Sla2p ( clc1 - [ 77 - 233 ] and clc1 - [ 41 - 233 ] ) generated strong halos , indicating that (cid:2) - factor processing and TGN sorting were restored , whereas the N - terminal fragment that could bind Sla2p but not HC ( clc1 - [ 1 - 143 ] ) was defective ( Figure 5C ) . In the absence of LC , HC is not trimerized efﬁciently , which causes destabilization of the HC ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) . We found that the C - terminal HC - binding fragment [ 77 - 233 ] , but not the N - terminal Sla2p binding domain [ 1 - 143 ] , rescued clathrin HC steady state levels ( T . Newpher , unpub - lished observations ) . Furthermore , cells expressing the C - terminal LC fragment [ 77 - 233 ] form clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) , even at CEN level expression , whereas CCVs could not be isolated from clc1 - [ 1 - 143 ] cells ( Figure 5D ) . Therefore the N - terminal Sla2p binding region of LC ( residues 1 – 76 ) is not required for TGN sorting or CCV production ( Figure 5 , C and D ) . However , the N - terminal fragment alone ( Clc1p - [ 1 - 143 ] ) is able to partially complement the temperature - sensitive growth defects of clc1 (cid:1) cells even without restoring TGN sorting or CCV formation . We next tested whether Clc1p - [ 1 - 143 ] was able to comple - ment the endocytic defects of clc1 (cid:1) yeast , by examining the dynamics of Sla2p - GFP and Abp1 - RFP . Unlike clc1 (cid:1) with empty vector ( n (cid:7) 293 cells ) , where only 27 % of the popu - lation consisted of cells in which nearly all Sla2p patches were mobile , 74 % of clc1 - [ 1 - 143 ] cells ( n (cid:7) 65 cells ) exhibited mobile Sla2p patches ( Figure 6 , A and B ; Supplementary Movie S2 ) . Interestingly , we found that GFP - LC - [ 1 - 143 ] was distributed throughout the cytosol , similar to full - length GFP - LC expressed in chc1 (cid:1) cells , suggesting that its ability to rescue endocytosis may occur without efﬁcient cortical patch association ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . However , we note that in chc1 (cid:1) cells , 10 % of LC is associated with mem - branes ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) , thus it is possible that some population of LC is present at cortical patches . We also found that 2 (cid:1) expression of Clc1p - [ 77 - 233 ] in clc1 (cid:1) cells ( n (cid:7) 42 cells ) also partially restored the percentage of cells with mobile Sla2p patches ( Figure 6A ) . Therefore , the N - terminus of LC is not essential for endocytosis in the presence of HC , as long as the C - terminal LC region that allows trimerization Figure 4 ( cont ) .

This indicates that there are redundant functions provided by HCs , which may form a scaffold for recruitment of other Sla2p interacting factors at the cortex . DISCUSSION In this study we show that the N - terminus of yeast clathrin LC directly interacts with the coiled - coil domain of Sla2p . Like the interactions observed between mammalian LCs and Hip1 / R ( Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2002 ; Chen and Brodsky , 2005 ) , our mapping experiments implicate the LC N - termi - nal conserved sequence ( residue 22 – 38 ) as most critical to Sla2p binding , although yeast LC sequences downstream ( up to residue 76 ) contribute . In addition to Hip1 / R binding , the acidic residues in the N - terminal conserved sequence of mammalian LC are important for LC’s ability to prevent spontaneous lattice assembly in vitro ( Ybe et al . , 1998 ) . Fur - thermore , Hip1 / R binding to these residues is thought to release LC’s inhibition on HC and thereby promote lattice formation ( Chen and Brodsky , 2005 ; Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2005 ) . Our studies here using in vivo analysis in yeast suggest a novel function for the LC / Sla2p interaction . Pre - viously we identiﬁed clathrin LC as a multicopy suppressor of clathrin HC deﬁciency ( SCD4 ; Nelson and Lemmon , 1993 ; Huang et al . , 1997 ) . These studies demonstrated that in the complete absence of clathrin HC , the LC was capable of restoring growth , potentially through other unknown inter - actions . A two - hybrid screen we performed with LC as a prey only identiﬁed two interacting partners , clathrin HC and Sla2p ( Henry et al . , 2002 ) . Further studies conﬁrmed Sla2p / LC binding is direct ( Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ) . Here we have shown that the Sla2p binding region on LC is required for its ability to suppress clathrin HC deﬁciency . In addition , this suppression is speciﬁc for endocytosis , as LC overexpression does not rescue the TGN sorting defects of HC - deﬁcient yeast ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) . Normally we presume the LC would be present at endo - cytic sites in association with HC . Although we found that the N - terminal region of the LC is dispensable when HC is present , we presume that the redundancy of other contrib - uting factors and interactions at endocytic sites , such as those mediated by the scaffolding function of clathrin , ac - count for this . A challenge of the endocytic ﬁeld has been to dissect the roles of individual protein – protein or protein – lipid interactions in the endocytic network . Thus our work demonstrates the value of in vivo analysis in a genetic system where the complexities and redundancy of the en - docytic process can be investigated . How might LC suppress the endocytic defect of chc1 (cid:1) cells ? Because the Sla2p - binding region of LC is responsible for its suppressor activity , we measured the lifetimes of Sla2p patches during the early stage of endocytosis . Inter - estingly , chc1 (cid:1) yeast overexpressing Clc1p or Clc1p - [ 1 - 143 ] increased the turnover rate of mobile Sla2p - GFP cortical patches from 40 s in chc1 (cid:1) to (cid:8) 28 s and increased the percentage of cells in which nearly all of the Sla2p patches are mobile . Therefore , LC drives or accelerates the Sla2p stage of endocytosis , likely through binding Sla2p , which ultimately increases the overall rate of endocytosis . If LC binding to Sla2p promotes endocytic progression , what then is the function of Sla2p during endocytosis ? Our results support the model where Sla2p serves as an anchor to couple the vesicle coat / early endocytic factors to the actin polymerization machinery , which ultimately provides the force for vesicle internalization ( Figure 7 ; see Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ) . Actin polymerization for endocytosis is initiated at the plasma membrane via Arp2 / 3 complex activators such as Las17p ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ) . To generate force for invagination of the membrane , the actin ﬁlaments would need to be tethered to the forming vesicle or associated endocytic factors . This might be mediated through an inter - action with the THATCH domain of Sla2p , which would Figure 7 . Model for LC activation of Sla2p during endocytosis . See Discussion for details . T . M . Newpher et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 4350 already be recruited to the endocytic patch through its in - teractions with phosphatidyl - inositol lipid ( via the ANTH domain ) , and potentially other early endocytic coat / patch factors . As actin polymerization continued at the cell sur - face , the force generated toward the Sla2p anchor would push the invaginating vesicle into the cell ( Figure 7A ) . This function is consistent with the phenotypes of sla2 (cid:1) yeast , where the early endocytic factors are recruited but fail to internalize and actin comet tails emanating from arrested patches at the cell surface wave into the cytosol ( Figure 7B ) , presumably unable to make productive contacts with the coat proteins ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Newpher et al . , 2005 ) . In addition , removal of the Sla2p talin - like domain also causes endocytic defects , demonstrating that actin binding is im - portant for Sla2p endocytic function ( Baggett et al . , 2003 ) . The interaction between LC and Sla2p could control Sla2p’s ability to anchor the vesicle coat to the polymeriza - tion of actin . Previously Yang et al . ( 1999 ) observed an in - tramolecular interaction between the THATCH domain and Sla2p residues 575 – 767 , which masks the actin - binding ca - pabilities of Sla2p . McCann and colleagues also demon - strated with Hip1 and Hip12 ( human Hip1R ) that an up - stream alpha helix ( USH ) of the THATCH domain self interacts with downstream sequences and prevents the in - teraction with actin ( Senetar et al . , 2004 ) . It is possible that binding of clathrin LC ( and / or other factors to the Sla2p coiled - coil domain ) could release the autoinhibition and per - mit THATCH domain interaction with actin , thus driving actin - based vesicle internalization . The absence of clathrin HC and its organizational functions at the early patch , would lead to loss of LC and other Sla2p binding factors ( e . g . , Sla1p ) from cortical patches to the cytosol and favor THATCH - USH self - association ( Figure 7C ) . Overexpression of LC , even in the absence of HC , would increase the chances of the Sla2p - LC interaction , thus suppressing the delayed endocytosis seen in chc1 (cid:1) ( Figure 7D ) . Although this model is intriguing , the region of LC bind - ing to Sla2p is upstream of the USH , so one would have to hypothesize that LC generates a conformation change distal from its binding site . Thus far we have not observed LC interaction outside the coiled - coil domain ( Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ) , but other sequences in LC could have a low afﬁnity interaction that extend over into the THATCH - USH regions to mediate these effects . An alternative idea is that LC bound to Sla2p regulates other early cortical patch fac - tors that interact with Sla2p to mediate a conformational change , or LC binding leads to their recruitment , which is required to drive progression of vesicle formation . Further studies will be required to distinguish among these models . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Mike Yaffe , Erin O’Shea , and Greg Payne for their gifts of many strains , plasmids , and antibodies .
