Previously , we have characterised the protein and RNA cargo of extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) secreted by two hepatic cellular models , a mouse hepatocyte progenitor cell line ( MLP29 ) and primary rat hepatocytes ( RHs ) . Here , we report the metabolome profile of these vesicles by performing a targeted UHPLC - MS metabo - lomics analysis of these two cellular models and their respective secreted EVs . Visual inspection of the data through principal component analysis allows clear separation of the metabolic profile of cells and EVs , and also of both cellular models . Correlation matrix supported that lipid composi - tion of EVs is mainly determined by parent cell composition . EVs derived from MLP29 and RHs showed a negative correlation in their percentage composition of ceramides , glycerophospholi - pids , sphingomyelins and triglycerides . Metabolites enriched in EVs were also different depending on the cellular model . EVs secreted by MLP29 were enriched in different species of sphingomye - lins and ceramides underrepresented in EVs secreted by RHs . Remarkably , triglycerides constitute an important percentage of the composition of EVs derived from RHs . We further investigate if the differences in lipid composition were also accompanied by differences in mechanical beha - viour , by using atomic force microscopy complemented with nanoindentation - based methodol - ogy . To compare the stiffness and brittleness of EVs derived from MLP29 cell line and RH primary cells , FZ curves were performed in the centre of single vesicles and the differences found in their force - vs . - indentation curves suggest that RHs EVs are softer ( less stiff ) and less resistance to mechanical failure than MLP29 EVs . Therefore , we can conclude that EVs from different origin carry a characteristic lipid composition related to their parental cell composition , and exhibit different mechanical properties .

Since our group published the first description of extracel - lular vesicles ( EVs ) released by hepatocytes [ 1 ] , sev - eral groups continued the molecular characterisation of vesicles of liver origin , and nowadays , different studies have shown the role played by EVs in the cross - talk of different hepatic cell populations ( reviewed in [ 2 ] ) . Among the different populations of liver cells , our group had used as cellular models the mouse liver progenitor cell line , MLP29 [ 3 ] , and primary culture model of hepatocytes obtained from rats through liver perfusion ( RHs ) . We have isolated and extensively characterised the small EVs released by those cells through flotation density gradient , cryo - EM and immunoblotting [ 1 ] . We have already published the protein profile [ 1 , 4 ] and the transcrip - tomic profile [ 5 ] . Their different origin has also been reflected in their cargo content , since EVs from pri - mary RHs maintain the gene expression and the presence of enzymes involved in the hepatic CONTACT Felix Royo froyo . ciberehd @ cicbiogune . es ; Juan M .

In the present study , we continue with the molecular characterisation of the content of EVs secreted by these two cellular models . The rationale behind our study design is to demonstrate that EVs coming from very different cell backgrounds , such different species , pro - liferative capabilities and biological activity , had a reflection in their metabolite composition as well . Furthermore , we try to infer if those differences had an impact in the physical properties of the vesicles . In the recent years , changes in the metabolite composi - tion of cells have been proved to be relevant in pathologic condition including cancer [ 6 ] . More importantly , EVs seem to be able to transfer metabolites to acceptor cells changing their metabolic status [ 7 , 8 ] . We have analysed by targeted ultra - high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ( UHPLC - MS ) , the presence of 302 metabolites in the EVs , and compared their abun - dance with those in the parental cell . It has been pointed out that targeted UHPLC - MS , although loses information about not considered metabolites , provides the necessary sensitivity and specificity to work in the EV field which requires special considerations , as detailed reviewed in [ 9 ] . As result , we have found significant differences between both cellular models that may also reflect again their dif - ferences in species , culture type , and cellular function , since they are equipped with different protein and tran - scriptome profile . To further characterise the vesicles , we have investi - gated if the differences in the lipid composition are accompanied by differences in the mechanical properties by using atomic force microscopy [ 10 ] . For imaging isolated EVs , which are weakly bonded to the substrate , we have preferred AFM imaging jumping mode ( JM ) [ 11 , 12 ] , although tapping mode has been also employed [ 13 ] . Beyond imaging , AFM also enables the quantifica - tion of mechanical properties , related to the stiffness and brittleness of these biological objects , using the nanoin - dentation methodology [ 14 ] . This technique consists on monitoring the deflection of the AFM tip while a single force - vs - Z - piezo is obtained by pushing on the top of an isolated EV . When compared EVs derived from MLP29 and RH cells , our results revealed important differences in the physical properties between both types of vesicles . Material and methods Cell culture All media and reagents for tissue culture were purchased from GIBCO ( Life technologies Inc . ) . MLP29 cells are a murine liver progenitor cell line [ 3 ] . All animal experi - mentation was conducted in accordance with Spanish guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals , and protocols approved by the CIC bioGUNE ethical review committee ( Permit Number : P - CBG - CBBA - 3610 ) . All surgery was performed under anaesthetic gas Isoflurane ( IsoFLO , Abbott Laboratories ) , and all efforts were made to minimise suffering . RHs were obtained by liver perfu - sion of nine - week - old healthy Wistar male rats as described previously [ 15 ] . Production and purification of EVs For EV production , MLP29 cells or fresh RH suspen - sion were plated to non - collagenised ( MLP29 ) or col - lagen - coated ( RH ) 150 - mm dishes , at 15 – 30 million cells per dish . Cells were cultured in complete DMEM medium [ Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle medium supple - mented with 10 % ( v / v ) foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 0 . 1 mg / ml streptomycin and 100 units / ml penicillin ( GIBCO , Life technologies Inc . ) ] for 24 h ( MLP29 cells ) or for 4 h ( RH ) at 37°C and 5 % of CO 2 , washed two times with Dulbecco ` s modified phosphate - buf - fered saline ( PBS ) and incubated 48 h ( MLP29 cells ) or 36 h ( RH ) in 25 - mM HEPES - containing complete DMEM medium previously depleted of contaminating vesicles by overnight centrifugation at 110 , 000x g [ 16 ] . After incubation , media were collected and EVs were isolated as previously described [ 17 ] ; briefly , culture supernatant was centrifuged at 1500x g for 10 min to remove lifted cells and cellular debris . The resultant supernatant was subjected to filtration on 0 . 22 μ m pore filters , followed by ultracentrifugation at 10 , 000x g and 100 , 000x g for 30 min and 75 min , respectively . The resulting pellets were solubilised in PBS , pooled , and again ultra - centrifuged at 100 , 000x g for 75 min . The final pellet of small EVs was solubilised in PBS to between 1 / 700th and 1 / 2000th the original volume of the culture supernatant , and aliquots were stored at − 80°C . Nanoparticle tracking analysis ( NTA ) Size distribution within EVs preparations was analysed by measuring the rate of Brownian motion using a NanoSight LM10 system ( NanoSight , Amesbury , UK ) , which is equipped with a fast video capture and parti - cle - tracking software . A volume of 300 µl of a dilution 1 : 100 in PBS of the original EVs preparation , obtained as described above , was loaded into the laser camera . NTA post acquisition settings were kept constant between samples , and each video was then analysed to give a profile of the size distribution . 2 F . ROYO ET AL . Electron microscopy For negative staining , vesicles were adsorbed onto glow - discharged Formvar - Carbon Niquel grids , washed with distilled water and stained with freshly prepared 2 % uranyl acetate in aqueous suspension . Negative stained samples were imaged at room tem - perature using a JEM - 1230 transmission electron microscope ( JEOL ) equipped with a thermionic tung - sten filament and operated at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV . Images were taken using the ORIUS SC1000 ( 4008 × 2672 pixels ) cooled slow - scan CCD camera ( GATAN ) . For cryo - electron microscopy , EV prepara - tions were directly adsorbed onto glow - discharged holey carbon grids ( QUANTIFOIL , Germany ) . Grids were blotted at 95 % humidity and rapidly plunged into liquid ethane with the aid of a VITROBOT ( Maastricht Instruments BV , The Netherlands ) . Vitrified samples were imaged at liquid nitrogen temperature using a JEM - 2200FS / CR transmission cryo - electron micro - scope ( JEOL , Japan ) equipped with a field emission gun and operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV . Metabolite extraction Different metabolite extraction methods ( platforms ) were employed in order to have a wide coverage of the chemical diversity of the molecules [ 18 ] , fractionat - ing the extracts into pools of species with similar phy - sicochemical properties as described by Barr et al . [ 19 ] . Initially , proteins were precipitated from the lysed cell and EVs samples by adding 600 - μ l methanol at room temperature . After short vortex mixing , the samples were spiked with 450 - μ l chloroform at room tempera - ture . Both extraction solvents were spiked with meta - bolites not detected in un - spiked cell and EVs extracts as internal standards . As the employed UHPLC - MS methods cover amino acids and lipids from different classes , multiple internal standards covering most of those classes were used : tryptophan - d5 ( indole - d5 ) , PC ( 13 : 0 / 0 : 0 ) , FA ( 19 : 0 ) and dehydrocholic acid were spiked in the methanol and used as internal standards in the first UHPLC – MS platform analysis ( Platform 1 ) ; SM ( d18 : 1 / 6 : 0 ) , PE ( 17 : 0 / 17 : 0 ) , PC ( 19 : 0 / 19 : 0 ) , TAG ( 13 : 0 / 13 : 0 / 13 : 0 ) , Cer ( d18 : 1 / 17 : 0 ) and ChoE ( 12 : 0 ) were added to the chloroform and used as internal standards in the second UHPLC – MS analysis ( Platform 2 ) ; and tryptophan - d5 ( indole - d5 ) was also used for the amino acid analysis ( Platform 3 ) . Samples were incubated at − 20°C for 30 min and after brief vortex two aliquots were collected . For the analysis of fatty acyls , bile acids , and lysoglycerophospholipids ( Platform 1 ) , 425 μ l of supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 16 , 000x g for 15 min at 4°C , dried under vacuum and reconstituted in methanol before being transferred to vials for UHPLC - MS analysis . 10 μ l ali - quots from the extracts prepared for Platform 1 were transferred to microtubes and derivatised for amino acid analysis ( Platform 3 ) [ 13 ] . The second aliquot was used for the analysis of gly - cerolipids , cholesteryl esters , sphingolipids and glycero - phospholipids ( Platform 2 ) . The cell extracts were mixed with 75 μ l water ( pH 9 ) . After brief vortex mixing , the samples were incubated for 1 h at − 20°C . After centri - fugation at 16 , 000x g for 15 min at 4°C , 180 μ l of the organic phase was collected and the solvent removed . The dried extracts were then reconstituted in 50 μ l acetronitrile / isopropanol ( 1 : 1 ) , resuspended for 10 min , centrifuged ( 16 , 000x g for 5 min at 4°C ) , and transferred to vials for UHPLC – MS analysis . UHPLC - MS metabolic profiling Targeted serum metabolic profiles were semi - quanti - fied as previously described [ 19 ] . Briefly , UHPLC - sin - gle quadrupole – MS was used for amino acid analysis while two separate UHPLC - time - of - flight – MS based platforms analysed the methanol and chloroform / methanol extracts . For each of the three analytical plat - forms , randomised sample injections were performed . The overall quality of the analysis procedure was mon - itored using five repeat injections of a pooled sample , considered as the quality control sample . The complete condition set for each platform can be found elsewhere [ 20 ] . The retention time stability ( generally < 6 s varia - tion , injection - to - injection ) , mass accuracy ( generally < 3 ppm for m / z 400 – 1000 , and < 1 . 2 mDa for m / z 50 – 400 ) ] and sensitivity of the system throughout the course of the run were examined . Data analysis All data were processed using the TargetLynx applica - tion manager for MassLynx 4 . 1 software ( Waters Corp . , Milford , USA ) . A set of predefined retention time , mass - to - charge ratio pairs , Rt - m / z , correspond - ing to metabolites included in the analysis are fed into the programme . Associated extracted ion chromato - grams ( mass tolerance window = 0 . 05 Da ) are then peak - detected and noise - reduced in both the UHPLC and MS domains such that only true metabolite related features are processed by the software . A list of chro - matographic peak areas is then generated for each sample injection . Data normalisation was based on multiple internal standards and pool calibration samples approach as JOURNAL OF EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES 3 described by [ 21 ] . The LC - MS features were identified prior to the analysis , either by comparison of their accu - rate mass spectra and chromatographic Rt with those of available reference standards or , where these were not available , by accurate mass MS / MS fragment ion analysis . Lipid nomenclature and classification follows the LIPID MAPS convention , www . lipidmaps . org . Atomic force microscopy The mechanical properties of small , spherical EVs made from different compositions of lipids were probed by an atomic force microscopy tip . Measurements were per - formed with an AFM microscope ( Nanotec Electrónica S . L . , Madrid , Spain ) operated in Jumping mode plus ( JM + ) for imaging in liquid [ 11 ] . We used triangular silicon - nitride cantilevers ( Bruker , SNL - 10 ) with a tip radius ≈ 5 nm and a nominal spring constant k _ cl ≈ 0 . 06 N / m , calibrated using Sader´s method [ 22 ] . These cantilevers were chosen because their spring con - stant was similar to the spring constant of the EVs . The experiments were carried out under physiological con - ditions with the sample and cantilevers submerged in EV buffer ( Hank ’ s Balanced Salt Solution from GIBCO® ( Thermofisher Scientific ) ) at a controlled temperature of 18°C . The first step in liquid - based AFM experi - ments is the immobilisation of EVs to a flat solid sub - strate . Each type of sample requires a particular absorption methodology and we used the “ trial and error ” method to find the best condition [ 23 ] . EVs use hydrophobic and / or electrostatic interactions to be immobilised in a substrate , such as glass , mica or HOPG ( highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ) . After sev - eral AFM experiments with EVs absorbed in different types of substrates , nickel - functionalised Muscovite mica ( Ni - mica ) was selected as the best substrate to image EVs by liquid - based AFM . To prepare Ni - mica substrate we exfoliated the mica to obtain a new flat layer , and then a 200 - µl drop of NiCl2 ( 5 mM ) solution was incubated overnight to finally be dried using pure gas nitrogen . To immobilise the EVs in the Ni - mica substrate a 25 - µl drop of the sample was incubated on Ni - mica during 30 min at 4°C . After incubation this surface was washed 10 times with buffer until a volume of 80 µl was reached . The tip was also pre - wetted with a 20 µl drop of buffer . All the images were acquired and analysed with WSxM software ( Nanotec Electronica ) [ 24 ] . The feedback force ( set point ) in imaging mode was 0 . 05V and the limit was set to 0 . 08V . All images were acquired with 256 points . Resulting in images of 256 × 256 pixels . The jump off ≈ 90 nm , jump sample ≈ 180 nm and control cycles ≈ 30 . Jumping mode + provides topographic images of these hydrated EVs absorbed in Ni - mica and the lateral displacement of the tip occurs when it is not in contact with the sample , so that dragging forces are mostly avoided during scan - ning using a safety Z _ lift ≈ 150 nm . In nanoindentation experiments , we followed the well - established procedures defined for the study of virus mechanics [ 25 ] . Each single force - vs . - Z - piezo ( FZ ) curve was obtained at the very top the single EVs . Each FZ curve gives the relation between the Z - piezo extension ( height ) and the bending of the cantilever ( force ) . All FZs were performed at the same Z - piezo displacement ( ~ 150 nm ) , at a loading rate of ~ 100 nm / s ( 256 points with samples / point = 124 ) . These FZs can be converted into force - vs . - indentation curves ( FICs ) by recording a calibration FZ of the cantilever deflection on the substrate next to the EV . Whereas the FZ performed on the sub - strate only accounts for the deformation of the cantilever , the FZ performed on the particle contains the deforma - tion of both the cantilever and the particle . Force - vs . - indentation curve ( FIC ) of each particle was obtained by subtracting the contribution of the cantilever from the curve performed on the particle . The elastic constant ( stiffness ) of each EV was obtained from the slope of the initial linear part of the force - vs . - indentation curve ( FIC ) . The linear part of the FIC is sometimes preceded by a short - range nonlinear region due to electrostatic , van der Waals , and hydration forces , which was excluded from the fitting . All the FICs have been performed under identical experimental conditions , such as rate and kind of tip . The region in the indentation curve that follows the linear regime correspond with the elastic limit of the EV and in most cases shows rupture events . From this non - linear region of the FIC we can extract mechanical properties of the EVs , such as the breaking force F _ breaking ( pN ) ( maximum force required to break a particle ) , critical deformation δ _ critical ( nm ) ( deforma - tion at which the particle breaks ) and critical strain ε ( normalised critical deformation ) . The values were obtained using WSxM software [ 24 ] . Statistics In the study , we compare percentage composition of metabolites in EVs and cells . Therefore , all the data were transformed into a percentage of the total sum of normalised peak intensities of Platform 1 + 2 ( lipids ) or Platform 3 ( amino acids ) . The percentages were employed for Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) representation ( using Factominer package of R ) , matrix correlation comparison ( using corrplot package from R ) and univariate test using aov linear model . Univariate statistic test was performed with aov function for all the metabolites ( 302 ) or the 16 families of metabolites with 4 F . ROYO ET AL . BH correction for multiple testing , and ( * ) denotes p - values under 0 . 05 meanwhile dash ( # ) denotes signifi - cance without correction for multivariate analysis . For each cellular model , we used four independent prepara - tions . The properties of MLP29 and RH - derived EVs characterised by atomic force microscopy were compared through t - test analysis Results MLP29 - and RH - secreted EVs were characterised using NTA and negative electron microscopy ( Figure 1 in Supplementary Material ) showing the presence of vesi - cles with a particle size of between 100 and 400 nm , being the majority around 150 nm . The protein and RNA content , as well as , the density distribution using sucrose gradient , have been previously reported [ 1 , 5 ] . Here , we have studied the metabolite content of EVs from these two models by UHPL - MS , and by using PCA analysis , observed a clear separation between both cel - lular models , as well as between cells and EVs ( Figure 1 ) . Lipid composition Intriguingly , the PCA analysis reflects larger differences between cells than between the cells and their corre - sponding EVs ( Figure 1 ) . Those differences were also confirmed by correlation analysis among the percen - tage composition of species within lipid families , where negative correlation was found for almost all the families ( Figure 2 ) when comparing MLP29 and RH cells . On the contrary , positive correlation between EVs and their parental cells can be found for all the struc - tural glycerophospholipids , with the exception of 1 - ether , 2 - acylglycerophosphocholines ( Figure 2 ) . The EV content of sphingomyelins and ceramides were also clearly determined by the parental cell composi - tion , as judged , by the positive correlation between EVs and parental cells . In order to analyse the difference between the two cellular models , it is important to distinguish between family compositions and species composition ( In Figure 2 in Supplementary Material , we show the percentage composition of EVs from RH and MLP29 for all the species analysed , grouped by families ) . For instance , ceramides show clear difference in species composition between RH and MLP29 EVs ( Figures 2 ( a , b ) in Supplementary Material ) . However , among total composition , ceramides are about the same percentage of the total composition in both types of cell - derived EVs ( Figure 3 ) . Thus , for under - standing the actions mediated for EVs it is important to reach species composition of the lipid fractions and not only stay with the global lipid content . Remarkably , the main difference between RH and MLP29 EVs is the high contribution of triglycerides in the EV preparation obtained from RH , and in a less extent diacylglycerophosphocholines ( Figure 3 ) . In fact , the influence of these large differences is reflected in the other families that relatively are more abundant in MLP29 EVs compared to RH EVs ( Figure 3 ) . This has also an effect in the profile of metabolites enriched in EVs vs . the parental cell . In Figure 4 , we present the common species that are significantly enriched or impoverished in EVs from both cellular models ( the result for each model individually is provided in Figure 3 in Supplementary Material ) . With the exception of PC ( O - 18 : 1 / 22 : 4 ) , free fatty acid 18 : 2n - x , and PE ( 16 : 0 / 18 : 1 ) that were almost absent in both types of EVs , it seems clear that most of lipids are enriched or impo - verished in EVs with respect to the parental cell , in opposite manner for each cell type ( Figure 4 ) . This opposite trend could be a reflection of the different composition of the respective parental cells . If the composition of both cellular models is compared ( Figure 5 ) , it can be observed that both ceramides and triglycerides are more abundant in RH cells , and therefore these lipids are impoverished in EVs derived from RHs with respect to their cell of origin , and the opposite occurs for MLP29 EVs .

The colour gradient is in accordance with the correlation coefficient value . Each of the presented correlations was calculated among all the species belonging to that family . The numerical value used for each species is the average of four samples ( biological replicates ) . Within each family , a correlation matrix was generated between the four group of samples existing ; EVs from MLP29 ( EV _ MLP ) , cells from MLP29 ( C _ MLP ) , EVs from RH ( EV _ RH ) and cells from RH ( C _ RH ) . 6 F . ROYO ET AL . impoverishment in the composition of EVs with respect to their parental cells , grouped by lipid families , are presented in Figure 6 , and clearly shows opposite trends between MLP29 and RH EVs . In summary , the targeted metabolomics profile highlights that the lipid content of the EVs secreted by two hepatic cellular models is different , and mainly the depletion of the polysunsaturated species of fatty acids ( 18 : 2n - x ) , the diacylglycerophophoetanolamine PE ( 16 : 0 / 18 : 1 ) , and the 1 - ether , 2 - acylglycerophospho - choline PC ( O - 18 : 1 / 22 : 4 ) are common ( Figure 4 ) . Interestingly , also in both cellular models the most abundant species in this latter family was the PC ( O - 24 : 1 / 20 : 4 ) ( Figure 2 ( h ) in Supplementary Material ) . Because of these two features , the correlation between 1 - ether , 2 - acylglycerophosphocholines are positive between EVs ( Figure 2 ) . For the other species , the correlation is negative as between the parental cells . Amino acid composition Because the amino acids are quantified by a different technique which included a preliminary reaction , we represented each amino acid as a percentage of the total sum of the amino acids . Each cellular model has a different percentage composition ( Figure 4 in Supplementary Material ) being differentiate clearly in several amino acids , probably as a reflection of their function . Significant differences were also obtained between the EVs secreted by these cellular models ( Figure 7 ) . Thus , phenylalanine , tyrosine , threonine , and glutamic acid were significantly lower in RH EVs Figure 3 . Comparison between the percentage composition of EVs from RH and MLP29 .

JOURNAL OF EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES 7 compared to MLP29 EVs , and on the contrary , the content of glycine seems to be higher in RH EVs but with high variability among the samples . Mechanical properties of extracellular vesicles AFM topographic images agreed with the analysis by cryo - TEM ( Figure 5 in Supplementary Material ) . The visualisation of the surface topography of EVs by AFM show EV particles that are pleiomorphic ( roughly sphe - rical or elongated ) made of small unilamellar vesicles ( closed lipid bilayers ) with a diameter between 30 – 150 nm ( Figure 8 ) . The imaging force were kept between 60 – 150 pN , which led to averages heights of 34 . 5 ± 9 nm and 32 . 5 ± 9 nm for MLP29 and RH EVs ( Table 1 ) , respectively . These values agree with the dimensions obtained by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and are compatible with the structure of EVs . In addition , we have measured by nanoindentation - based methodol - ogy different mechanical properties of the two types of EVs , MLP29 vs . RHs , which differ in their lipid composi - tion . Although more than 50 single vesicles were Figure 4 . Metabolites impoverished or enriched in EVs common to MLP29 and RH .

Therefore , values to the left represent impoverishment in EVs while values to the right represents enrichment in EVs . Only those species whose percentages have a statistically significant difference between cells and EVs for both types of cells are presented in this graph .

ROYO ET AL . analysed , in order to compare the stiffness and brittleness of the single EVs derived from these two different cellular models , only complete FIC curves which includes a rup - ture point were taken into consideration ( see Figure 9 ) . The averaged spring constant , critical deformation and the averaged breaking force are presented in Table 1 . We found statistically significant differences between MLP29 and RH EVs regarding the elastic constant k ( N / m ) and the breaking force ( pN ) , showing that MLP29 EVs are more rigid and require more force to be broken under a nanoindentation pressure . Discussion In the present work , we compared two different cellu - lar models . Apart of the difference in species , MLP29 are mouse progenitor cells , while RHs come from a primary culture of differentiated and specialised cells . This comparison is important since supports that EVs are strongly dependent of the donor cells employed as model , and that the composition of the vesicles have an effect on their physical properties . The difference had a clear impact in the metabolic composition , at the level of lipid species that is reflected in the composition of the EVs . Previous studies involving cell lines did not showed such clear differences between cell lines [ 26 ] . Our results suggest that there is a high correlation between EVs and their parental cells supporting lipi - domics as a useful technique to identify the source of circulating EVs . Ceramides are more abundant in RH than MLP29 cells , but approximately the same percentage in EVs , as a result of enrichment in MLP29 EVs . This ceramide enrichment has previously been described for exosomes [ 27 ] , a fact that Figure 5 . Comparison between the percentage composition of cells for RH and MLP29 .

JOURNAL OF EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES 9 linked to the involvement of ceramides in the biogenesis of exosomes [ 28 ] . Monohexosylceramides are equally abun - dant in both cell lines but again enriched in MLP29 EVs , and subsequently , their percentage is higher in MLP29 EVs . Interestingly , there is a negative correlation between ceramides species among both cell lines and EVs , being more represented in RH EVs slightly longer chains ( Figure 2 ( a ) in Supplementary Material ) . The length and asymme - try of the ceramides has been correlated to the ability to form interdigitation influencing membrane fluidity and permeability [ 29 ] . Shorter ceramides will promote a posi - tive curvature , and reduces bilayer permeability [ 30 ] . Diglycerides are also equally abundant in EVs but more abundant in RH cells , thus , there is an enrichment in MLP29 EVs versus its parental cell line . Sphingomyelins are enriched in MLP29 EVs , and also more abundant in the MLP29 cells than in RH . Therefore , represent a higher percentage of the lipid composition of MLP29 EVs than in the composition of RH EVs . As mentioned in the previous families , the enrichment of both sphingomyelins and diglycerides has been described in exosomes [ 31 ] . We also should mention that for both families , a negative correlation among species exists in both types of EVs . In the case of diglycerides , the percentage of polyunsaturated chains is higher for RH EVs ( Figure 2 ( g ) in Supplementary Material ) , while in the case of sphingomyelins the spe - cies with long chain acyls are more predominant in RH EVs ( Figure 2 ( j ) in Supplementary Material ) . Again , long chains seem to have a role in the interdigitation of the outer membrane [ 27 , 32 ] which finally may influ - ence the physical properties of the membrane . It is interesting that it has been described that sphingomye - lins and their interaction with cholesterol increases the range of membrane stiffness [ 33 ] . Among glycerophospholipids , there are differences depending on the families . Diacylglycerophosphocholines and monoacylglycerophosphocholines show an opposite trend , being more abundant the first in RH cells and EVs , and the last , more represented in MLP29 . Interestingly , we have previously reported the increase in blood of diacyl - glycerophosphocholines after hepatotoxic treatment , pre - sumably released from hepatocytes [ 34 ] . In the case of diacylglycerophosphoethanolamines , they are relatively more abundance in RH cells than in MLP29 cells , mean - while the relationship between both types of EVs is the opposite . It has been described that hepatocytes use a different synthesis route than cultured cells to form phos - phoetanolamines , and that route is accelerated in presence of diacylglycerol [ 35 ] . Interestingly , our data indicate that Figure 6 . Families of lipids impoverished or enriched in EVs .

The height of the particle was considered as the maximum value obtained in this topographical profile . JOURNAL OF EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES 11 the relative composition in EVs from both types is similar in spite of the more abundance in the parental cell . It is interesting to remark that the shift from monoacyl to diacylglycerophosphocholines will have an impact in the asymmetry of the membranes , favouring the transport of certain lipids [ 36 ] . Moreover , exist a negative correlation between MLP29 and RH , and clearly the percentage of saturated species is higher in MLP29 , while percentage of unsaturated is higher of RH EVs ( Figure 2 ( d , e , m ) in Supplementary Material ) . Unsaturated species of glycero - phopholipids creates “ extra space ” between the two hydro - carbon acyl chains , and that makes the membrane more permeable to water [ 37 ] . This affects membrane properties such as lipid packing , molecular cross - sectional area , the tendency for curvature , membrane permeability , and vis - coelasticity [ 36 , 38 ] . Accordingly , the differences in EVs lipid composi - tion , and their higher saturation in MLP EVs , it is also accompanied by differences in EVs physic - mechanical properties . We previously found differences in the den - sity of both types of EV , being 1 . 12 – 1 . 15 g / L the flota - tion density of MLP29 in sucrose gradient , while the EVs derived from RH float in a density between 1 . 17 – 1 . 20 g / L [ 5 ] . The characterisation of exosomes by atomic force was first reported in 2010 [ 39 ] , and it has been reported to characterise saliva exosomes [ 40 ] , and dif - ferences between glioblastoma - derived exosomes and non - tumoural - derived exosomes [ 41 ] . Moreover , AFM indentation experiments have also been used to measure the stiffness and strength of lipid - based biocontainers such as synaptic and endocytosis vesicles [ 42 – 44 ] . Our results obtained by nanoidentation analysis suggested that RH EVs were softer and less resistance to mechan - ical stress . The differences in lipid composition could produce a softening of the structure of RH - derived EVs , in so much as a decrease in particle stiffness of 25 % was observed between MLP29 and RH - derived EVs . The effect over elasticity in membranes of the increasing poly - unsaturated acyl - chains has been described pre - viously using atomic force [ 45 ] . More interestingly , the averaged spring constant of these MLP29 EVs was simi - lar to influenza virus , a matrix shell enveloped virus of 100 nm in diameter and 5 nm thick . Besides , the aver - aged breaking force for MLP29 EVs were 0 . 9nN , a little lower than the forces required to puncture the influenza envelope ( above 1nN ) . This high structural strength of MLP29 EVs , almost similar to virus protein shells [ 25 ] , could be explained by the fact that influenza virions share an underlying protein composition with exosomes , perhaps because influenza virions could be formed by subverting EV production machinery [ 46 ] . The differ - ences found between MLP29 and RH suggest that MLP29 EVs had a better protection against the external environment , meanwhile RH EVs are more fragile . This may explain more rupture in the isolation process that would be translated in more contaminated samples , as we have been observed by cryo - EM experiments during the last decade at our lab , Figure 5 in Supplementary Material . In another hand , the higher flexibility of RH EVs can be best described in terms of protein structure and dynamics , since areas with a high local mechanical flexibility ( low stiffness ) may inextricably correspond to conformational highly dynamic regions [ 14 ] , and their mechanical softening could be required to improve their Table 1 .

Nevertheless , a correct interpreta - tion of EV mechanics in terms of stability would require an adequate linkage between the ability of this lipid enveloped particles to resist chemical and mechanical stresses [ 47 ] . We should also mention that other glycerophospholi - pids are more represented in EVs from MLP29 . For instance , monoacylphosphoethanolamines have positive enrichment into the EVs of MLP29 . In other cases , such dyacilgliceridphosphoinositols , diacylglycerophosphoetha - nolamines , 1 - ether , 2 - acylglycerophosphocholines , 1 - ether , 2 - acylglycerophosphoethanolamines and monoacyl - phosphoinositols , there is not a positive enrichment of the families into the EVs , but they are also more abundant in the MLP29 cells . Remarkably , lipid species with higher percentage at RH EVs harbour the polyunsaturated chain 20 : 4 ( arachidonic acid ) for many of the phospholipid families ( Figure 2D , E , F , M , N , O in Supplementary Material ) . In agreement , we also observe more unesterified arachidonic acid in RH EVs ( Figure 2 ( l ) in Supplementary Material ) . It has been related the presence of arachidonic phospholipids to the ability of releasing triglycerides , asso - ciated to the presence of an enzyme that regulate the introduction of arachidonic acid into phospholipids [ 48 ] . Indeed , there is a release of triglycerides . Triglycerides are highly present both in EVs and cells from RH . Opposite , for MLP29 they represent a low percentage of their lipid composition , suggesting that the progenitor cell line is not engaged in the synthesis of triglycerides as mature hepatocyte does . However , for MLP29 EVs , some species of triglycerides are enriched in EVs compared with their parental cell line , in concrete species with more unsaturated bonds ( Figure 2 ( k ) in Supplementary Material ) . Triglycerides are not commonly part of membranes [ 49 ] . They has been described in big microvesicles ( in 10 , 000x g cen - trifugation ) from Huh7 cells [ 26 ] but their presence may be related to co - isolation of lipid droplets or autophagosomes [ 27 , 50 ] . Interestingly , there is indeed autophagy activity in primary hepatocytes cell cultures [ 51 ] and therefore such contamination is a possibility . On the other hand , it is also possible that triglycerides were also transported in EVs . Indeed , it has been showed that the presence of arachidonoyl phospholi - pids are required for triglycerides release from hepato - cytes [ 48 ] , and the hypothesis for this phenomena would be related to the requirement of certain mem - brane composition to favour lipid transportation , since biophysical studies suggested that greater lipid trans - port is generally observed with more fluid and highly curved membrane surfaces [ 52 ] . As described above , RH EVs are more abundant on arachidonoyl phospho - lipids than MLP29 EVs , and the differences found between both types of EVs could be the reflection of the function of EVs in lipid transport . Fatty acids are in similar percentage in both types of EVs in spite of being more abundant in RH cells . Clearly , RH EVs had more polyunsaturated fatty acids than MLP29 EVs . It has been described that exosomes are rich in monounsaturated fatty acids , as it is the case of MLP29 [ 31 ] . As mentioned , for RH EVs there is more non - esterified arachidonic acid ( 20 : 4n - 6 ) , a meta - bolite that play an important role in cell communica - tion as it regulate special calcium channels [ 53 ] . There is a common absence of some species , for instance gamma - linoleic acid ( 18 : 3n - 6 ) , although the fact that they are not impoverish in EVs means that the amounts in the cells are very low as well compared with other fatty acids ( Figure 2 ( k ) in Supplementary Material ) . We should also mention that the cholesteryl esters composition is quite similar for both types of EVs , although we can observe that relative to the par - ental cell , EVs from MLP29 are impoverished in meta - bolites from this family , and again , this seems to confirm that EVs from MLP29 had characteristic simi - lar to other exosomes - enriched preparations analysed previously [ 26 ] . As it happened with phospholipids , the species with higher percentage for RH EVs harbour a 20 : 4 chain ( Figure 2 ( c ) in Supplementary Material ) . Finally , we should mention that there are differences in amino acids , mainly the low percentage of phenyla - lanine and tyrosine in RH both cells and EVs . It is worth to mention that hepatocytes have the complete enzymatic cascade to perform phenylalanine conver - sion to tyrosine , and the tyrosine catabolism , whose last step is catabolised by the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase [ 54 ] an enzyme present in RH EVs [ 4 ] , so it is possible to speculate that hepatocytes can consume these two amino acids in a more efficient way than MLP29 cells . Moreover , MLP29 are proliferating cells , and this could explain the relative importance of some essential amino acids . It has been described that in proliferative cells amino acids represent a more impor - tant part of the total biomass of the cell [ 55 ] . Although the important differences observed between both cel - lular models reflects the role of donor cell into EVs generation , we should not forget that both cell types are different not only in biological properties and pro - liferative capabilities , but also in species , limiting the conclusions of our study . Moreover , more profound studies would be necessary to address how pathological conditions may affect EVs composition , and therefore JOURNAL OF EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES 13 their physical properties and their potential role in the pathogenesis and as a source of biomarkers . Conclusions MLP29 EVs are enriched in sphingomyelins , glyco - sphingolipids ( monohexosylceramides ) and cera - mides , in concordance with previous reports for EVs [ 27 , 31 ] . When look at the species , there is a tendency of enrichment ( vs . the parental cells ) of unsaturated species in certain families , very evident for triglycer - ides , as well as , glycerophosphocholines . Again , these data are in agreement with the observation for color - ectal cancer - derived exosomes that had a higher unsa - turated / saturated ratio than cells for those families [ 56 ] . At this respect , MLP29 EVs composition is in better agreement with a previous description of lipids in exosomes [ 27 ] , although some other report dis - agrees , suggesting them as enriched in microvesicles preparations instead of exosomes [ 26 ] . On the other hand , the characteristics of RH EVs are quite different from other cell lines , including the hepatocyte - derived cellular carcinoma Huh7 . From one side , due to the large variation among the different preparations , there is no significant enrichment in terms of families . Instead , the species enriched belong to different families such monounsaturated fatty acids , lysopho - sphoinositols and the 1 - ether , 2 - acylglycerophospho - choline ( for instance PC ( O – 16 : 0 / 14 : 0 ) , see 3B in Supplementary Material ) . Among the percentage composition , triglycerides are very relevant , a lipid that has not been considered to be included in exo - somes since they normally are not part of the mem - brane composition [ 27 , 49 ] . Although the presence of triglycerides may be the consequence of copurification of lipid droplets and / or autophagosomes , as being suggested , it could also suggest that EVs play a role in the release of triglycerides from liver , a function facilitate by their differential composition , rich in arachidonoyl phospholipids . More important , the pre - sence of non - esterified arachidonic acid suggests com - plex physiological role for these vesicles in the systemic context . The difference in composition is also accompanied by differences in the mechanical properties of the vesicles . MLP29 - derived EVs are less fragile , with a structure almost as resistant as the influenza virus , pointing towards the high resis - tance of these particles in the extracellular environ - ment . In the other hand , the higher flexibility of RH - derived EVs uncovers highly dynamic regions and their mechanical softening would improve their inter - action with other cells , which reinforce the idea of a role for lipid transportation between cells .
