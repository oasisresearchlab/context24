The Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology , No . 157 Jinbi Road , 650034 Kunming , Yunnan , China Abstract Background Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) generally has a relatively low survival rate after treatment . There is an urgent need to find new biomarkers that may improve the survival prognosis of patients . Machine - learning tools are more and more widely used in the screening of biomarkers . Methods Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator ( LASSO ) , Support Vector Machine - Recursive Feature Elimination ( SVM - RFE ) , Random Forest ( RF ) , eXtreme Gradient Boosting ( XGBoost ) , lrFuncs , IdaProfile , caretFuncs , and nbFuncs models were used to screen key genes closely associated with AML . Then , based on the Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) , pan - cancer analysis was performed to determine the correlation between important genes and AML or other cancers . Finally , the diagnostic value of important genes for AML was verified in different data sets . Results The survival analysis results of the training set showed 26 genes with survival differences . After the intersection of the results of each machine learning method , DNM1 , MEIS1 , and SUSD3 were selected as key genes for subsequent analysis . The results of the pan - cancer analysis showed that MEIS1 and DNM1 were significantly highly expressed in AML ; MEIS1 and SUSD3 are potential risk factors for the prognosis of AML , and DNM1 is a potential protective factor . Three key genes were significantly associated with AML immune subtypes and multiple immune checkpoints in AML . The results of the verification analysis show that DNM1 , MEIS1 , and SUSD3 have potential diagnostic value for AML . Conclusion Multiple machine learning methods identified DNM1 , MEIS1 , and SUSD3 can be regarded as prognostic biomarkers for AML .

BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2024 ) 24 : 2 Backgrounds Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) is a malignant bone mar - row disease characterized by clonal expansion and dif - ferentiation arrest of bone marrow progenitor cells . Most AML cases still have no clear etiology [ 1 ] . AML is the most common acute leukemia in adults , and its survival time is short [ 2 ] . In recent years , with the rapid devel - opment of molecular targeted therapy and combined therapy , and the widespread application of these two therapies in clinical practice , the survival and progno - sis of AML patients have been relatively prolonged and improved [ 3 ] . Intensive chemotherapy and gene stem cell transplantation are usually applied to a small number of young patients , and for most patients , the prognosis and survival rate are poor [ 4 ] . Although the treatment strategies for AML have been continuously adjusted and improved over the past few decades , the effect of these treatment strategies on the survival and prognosis of patients is still minimal [ 5 ] . Therefore , the identification of new and effective prognostic biomarkers is crucial for accurately predicting the prognosis of AML patients and for a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of AML . With the advancement of gene sequencing technol - ogy , a series of gene databases have emerged , such as the Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) and the Gene Expres - sion Omnibus ( GEO ) . In addition , machine learning algorithms , as one of the main tools of data mining , are now widely used in the medical field . The algorithm establishes a risk model by learning the existing data of patients , which is used to predict the disease , diagnose the severity of the disease , and evaluate the prognosis of the disease [ 6 , 7 ] . Its main types include the least abso - lute shrinkage and selection operator ( LASSO ) , ran - dom forest graph ( RF ) , support vector machine ( SVM ) , decision tree , and other common algorithms . LASSO is the only property of the absolute value of the penal - ized regression coefficient [ 8 ] . The greater the penalty , the greater the shrinkage of the coefficient , and then remove the unimportant covariates [ 9 , 10 ] . Support vec - tor machine recursive feature elimination ( SVM - RFE ) is a supervised machine learning technique widely used in classification and regression . Its purpose is to classify data points by maximizing the margin between classes in high - dimensional space . The features are classified according to the accuracy value , and several features with higher accuracy are selected [ 11 ] . The RF algorithm is a method of training and predicting samples by construct - ing a decision tree . The features with high importance scores are obtained by calculating and sorting the impor - tance scores of features [ 12 ] . These machine algorithms can learn and train from data to achieve accurate predic - tions of future events [ 13 ] . These algorithms are gradually being used in the prognosis of lung cancer , breast cancer , liver cancer , gastrointestinal cancer , and other malignant tumors , which has become a hot spot in clinical research [ 14 – 17 ] . Machine learning algorithms contain a variety of types , and each model has its scope of application . Different types , different volumes , and different characteristics of data have different prediction performance . Therefore , this study aims to screen genes related to AML prog - nosis based on multiple types of machine learning , and then take the intersection gene of each machine learning result as the key gene for subsequent research . Finally , pan - cancer analysis was performed on key genes to fur - ther clarify the correlation between key genes and the occurrence and development of AML or other cancers and then to clarify the diagnostic value of key genes for AML . This study will provide new ideas for the prognosis evaluation of AML patients , and then promote the effi - cient and accurate individualized treatment of AML . Methods Acquisition of data sets Data on acute myeloid leukemia were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) database ( https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo / query / acc . cgi ) . Due to the excessive amount of search data , we set some condi - tions to select candidate data sets . The specific screen - ing criteria for the dataset used in this study were acute leukemia , United States , Homo sapiens , adults , and with a total sample size greater than 100 people . Finally , three data sets were selected for subsequent research ( GSE63270 , GSE15061 , and GSE48558 ) . The basic infor - mation of each data set is shown in Table 1 . The gene set of GSE15061 was obtained for expression difference analysis ( setting the threshold : | logFC | > 1 . 5 , P < 0 . 05 ) . The differential volcano map ( http : / / sangerbox . com / tool . html ) was drawn using the SangerBox website . Screening the key genes related to the prognosis of AML based on multiple machine - learning methods Kaplan - Meier ( KM ) survival analysis of differentially expressed genes in the training set was performed using the R - 4 . 1 . 1 software package ( “survival” and “survminer” ) . Subsequently , R - 4 . 1 . 1 different software packages were used to perform machine learning such as LASSO ( R package : “glmnet” , “survival” , “survminer” ) , RF ( R pack - age : “randomForest” , “caret” , “varSelRF” ) , SVM - RFE Table 1 Basic information for all data sets used in this study Data sets ID Platforms Samples Application Control AML cases GSE15061 GPL570 138 404 Test set GSE63270 GPL17810 42 62 Verification set GSE48558 GPL6244 49 39 Verification set AML : acute myeloid leukemia Page 3 of 15 Cheng et al . BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2024 ) 24 : 2 ( R package : “svm” , “caret” , and “randomForest” ) , and XGBoost ( R package : “xgboost” , and “caret” ) on genes related to AML prognosis in the training set . In this study , we using the different functions in caret pack - age of the R software ( lrFuncs , IdaProfile , caretFuncs , and nbFuncs ) to screened the optimal genes . The spe - cific operation process and screening criteria were car - ried out according to the official manual of R software ( http : / / topepo . github . io / caret / recursive - feature - elimina - tion . html # recursive - feature - elimination - via - caret ) . The parameters of the machine learning algorithms used in this study were set according to previous studies [ 18 – 20 ] . Finally , the key genes were obtained after the intersec - tion of the genes screened by the above machine - learning methods for subsequent analysis . Pan - cancer analysis of key genes Using the UCSC XENA database ( http : / / xenabroswer . net / hub ) , which integrates public data from multiple databases , downloaded data sets that have been uni - formly standardized ( including the Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) , Genotype Tissue Expression ( GTEx ) . We extracted the expression of key genes in 33 cancer types , immune subtypes , clinical information , and other data from the downloaded data set . Then SangerBox ( http : / / sangerbox . com / tool . html ) was used to analyze the expression of key genes in cancer , survival analysis , immune analysis , and so on . The correlation matrix heat map was drawn by Sanger - Box to explore the expression differences at immune checkpoints . The box plot was drawn by the R package ( “ggplot2” , “ggsignif” , “ggpubr” , and “RColorBrewer” ) to analyze the correlation between key genes and different subtypes of immune cells . Gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) of key genes To identify pathways associated with key genes , we per - formed GSEA enrichment analyses . GSEA does not require genetic screening , thereby preserving genes that are not significantly different in expression but are func - tionally important [ 21 ] . GSEA analysis was performed by Sangerbox online bioinformatics tool ( http : / / sanger - box . com / tool . html ) based on AML mRNA data in the training set ( GSE15061 ) , which will identify the signal - ing pathways that potentially be related to the key genes screened by the machine learning algorithm . Validation of diagnostic value of key genes To verify the diagnostic value of key genes for acute myeloid leukemia , GSE63270 and GSE48558 data sets were used for verification . The “barplot” software pack - age in R was used to verify the differential expression of key genes in AML patients , and the ROC ( receiver operating characteristic curve ) curve was drawn to evalu - ate the diagnostic value of key genes . Results Survival analysis of differentially expressed genes The difference expression analysis of the training set GSE15061 was performed , and the threshold was set : | logFC | > 1 . 5 , P < 0 . 05 . The results showed that ( Fig . 1 ) there were 171 differentially expressed genes , including 151 down - regulated genes and 20 up - regulated genes . Subsequent survival analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that a total of 26 differentially expressed genes had prognostic differences in the training set ( Sup - plemental Fig . 1 ) . Screening key genes related to AML prognosis based on multiple machine learning Firstly , LASSO regression analysis was used to screen 26 genes with prognostic value , and 10 - fold cross - validation was performed . According to LASSO regression machine learning ( Fig . 2A – B ) , a total of 20 genes were screened . Then , we use the RF algorithm ( parameter settings : ntree = 2000 , mtry = 6 ) to obtain the importance of input variables and screen out the top five genes ( Fig . 2C – D ) . The SVM - RFE algorithm was used to remove the last few feature genes in the weight ranking of the training set in one round , and 22 genes were screened ( Fig . 3A ) . According to the XGBoost model ( Fig . 3B ) , 19 genes were screened and showed good discrimination , with an AUC of 0 . 964 ( Fig . 3C ) . Finally , the recursive feature elimina - tion in the ‘caret’ package was used to construct differ - ent models . The results showed that lrFuncs screened 15 genes ( Fig . 4A ) , IdaProfile screened 26 genes ( Fig . 4B ) , caretFuncs screened 12 genes ( Fig . 4C ) , and nbFuncs screened 24 genes ( Fig . 4D ) . The important genes screened by each machine learn - ing algorithm have been obtained ( Table 2 ) . And the intersection genes of important genes screened by these machine - learning algorithms are also summarized in Table 2 . Figure 5 is the Upset diagram , which illustrat - ing shared genes in important genes screened by differ - ent machine learning algorithm . The results showed that DNM1 , MEIS1 , and SUSD3 can be regarded as key genes for subsequent studies . Pan - cancer analysis for key genes associated with AML prognosis For the three key genes screened by machine learning tools , single gene pan - cancer analysis was performed respectively . The results showed that DNM1 , MEIS1 , and SUSD3 were differentially expressed between various cancers and normal tissues . MEIS1 and DNM1 are highly expressed in AML ( Fig . 6A and B ) , while SUSD3 is not significantly different in AML ( Fig . 6C ) . Page 4 of 15 Cheng et al . BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2024 ) 24 : 2 To study the relationship between the expression lev - els of DNM1 , MEIS1 , and SUSD3 and the prognosis of 33 kinds of cancer , we carried out a survival correlation analysis . Cox proportional hazard model analysis showed that MEIS1 was not only associated with poor progno - sis of AML ( p = 8 . 0e - 3 , HR = 1 . 15 ) , but also associated with poor prognosis of GBML , LGG , KIRP , and THCA ( Fig . 7A ) . At the same time , MEIS1 was significantly cor - related with the prognosis of HNSC , ACC , and KIRC . In addition to the poor prognosis of AML ( p = 6 . 6e - 3 , HR = 1 . 25 ) , SUSD3 was also significantly associated with the poor prognosis of GBML , LGG , and ACC ( Fig . 7B ) . At the same time , SUSD3 was significantly associated with a better prognosis of various types of cancer ( SKCM , SKCM - M , BRCA , KIPAN , MESO , SARC , LUAD ) . DNM1 was significantly associated with a better prognosis of AML ( p = 0 . 04 , HR = 0 . 88 ) and PAAD ( p = 0 . 02 , HR = 0 . 79 ) ( Fig . 7C ) . In addition , DNM1 was also significantly asso - ciated with poor prognosis in a variety of types ( THCA 、 ACC 、 LIHC 、 MESO 、 COADREAD 、 BLCA 、 C OAD ) . To explore the relationship between the expression levels of key genes and AML immune subtypes , we analyzed the correlation between key genes and AML immune subtypes based on the TCGA data set . The results showed that DNM1 ( p < 0 . 001 ) , MEIS1 ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and SUSD3 ( p < 0 . 001 ) were significantly associated with AML C1 - C6 immune subtypes ( Fig . 8A ) . Based on the TCGA database , the correlation between key gene expression levels and immune checkpoints was explored . The results showed that the expression levels of DNM1 , MEIS1 , and SUSD3 were associated with many can - cer immune checkpoints ( Fig . 8B – D ) . Specifically , the expression level of MEIS1 was not correlated with the AML immune checkpoint ( Fig . 8B ) . Figure 8C shows that the expression level of DNM1 is significantly correlated with the two immune checkpoints of AML ( HAVCR2 and PDCD1LG2 ) . Figure 8D showed that the SUSD3 expression level was significantly correlated with the five immune checkpoints of AML ( CD274 , CTLA4 , LAG3 , PDCD1 , and TIGIT ) . Gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) of key genes GSEA analysis showed that genes related to DNM1 in the training set were mainly enriched in aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis , acute myeloid leukemia and other pathways ( Fig . 9A ) . Genes related to MEIS1 were mainly enriched in pathways such as cell cycle , P53 signaling pathway , o glycan biosynthesis , etc . ( Fig . 9B ) . Genes associated with SUND3 are mainly enriched in tryptophan metabolism , NOD - like receptor signaling pathway , chemokine signal - ing pathway etc . ( Fig . 9C ) . Validation of diagnostic value of key genes To further explore the role of key genes as AML bio - markers , we selected two data sets to verify their diag - nostic value . The results showed that in the GSE48588 ( Fig . 10A – B ) and GSE63270 ( Fig . 10C – D ) datasets , the Fig . 1 Differentially expressed genes in training set GSE15061 .

BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2024 ) 24 : 2 expression levels of DNM1 and MEIS1 in AML were sig - nificantly higher than those in the control group , while the expression levels of SUSD3 in AML were significantly lower than those in the control group . ROC results sug - gested that the expression differences of DNM1 , MEIS1 , and SUSD3 have potential diagnostic value for AML . Discussion The prognosis of AML is poor . Young and elderly patients have a high risk of recurrence of chemotherapy resis - tance , and alternative and targeted drugs are needed to improve their survival rate [ 22 ] . At present , the treatment of AML mainly includes chemotherapy and molecu - lar targeted therapy , such as FMS - like tyrosine kinase 3 ( FLT3 ) inhibitors , IDH [ isocitrate dehydrogenase ( NADP + ) ] inhibitors , and monoclonal antibodies [ 23 ] . Despite many treatments , the prognosis of AML is still poor . High - throughput genomic screening methods and computer - aided techniques can be used to predict bio - markers related to disease occurrence and assist in the design of new targeted drugs [ 24 ] . Therefore , screening biomarkers related to the prognosis of AML patients through machine learning methods will provide a valu - able reference for individualized targeted therapy and prognosis prediction of AML in clinical practice . In this study , 26 genes with survival differences were screened from the differentially expressed genes in the training set . To further screen out the key genes closely Fig . 4 Screening important genes related to the prognosis of AML patients based on recursive feature elimination ( RFE ) algorithm . Feature selection is performed using multiple functions in the R package caret ( lrFuncs , IdaProfile , caretFuncs , and nbFuncs ) . ( A ) lrFuncs model identified 15 genes as the optimal characteristic genes ( maximum accuracy = 0 . 9595 ) . ( B ) 26 genes were identified as the optimal feature genes by the IdaProfile model ( maximum accuracy = 0 . 9595 ) ; ( C ) caretFuncs model identified 12 genes as the optimal characteristic genes ( maximum accuracy = 0 . 9853 ) ; ( D ) nbFuncs model identi - fied 24 genes as the optimal feature genes ( maximum accuracy = 0 . 8856 ) Page 7 of 15 Cheng et al . BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2024 ) 24 : 2 related to the prognosis of AML , this study screened key genes based on a variety of machine learning . The results showed that the machine learning method used in this study identified DNM1 , MEIS1 , and SUSD3 as key genes significantly associated with AML prognosis based on different screening criteria . To further clarify the corre - lation between key genes and the occurrence and devel - opment of AML and various cancers , this study also performed a single - gene pan - cancer analysis of three key genes based on the TCGA database . The expression of MEIS1 and DNM1 in AML and normal controls was sig - nificantly different . MEIS1 , SUSD3 , and DNM1 were sig - nificantly associated with the prognosis of AML patients . Three key genes were significantly associated with AML immune subtypes , and DNM1 and SUSD3 were signifi - cantly associated with multiple immune checkpoints of AML . In addition to the strong association between the three key genes and AML , this study also found evi - dence that they are closely related to the prognosis and immunity of various cancers . More importantly , we also selected two validation datasets to verify the diagnostic value of key genes for AML , and the results showed that DNM1 , MEIS1 , and SUSD3 had good diagnostic values for AML . The myeloid tropism leukemia virus integration site 1 ( MEIS1 ) gene is located on 1p13 - 14 of human chromo - some 2 and is widely expressed in various tissues includ - ing blood , liver , and brain [ 25 ] . MEIS1 is related to the differentiation of leukemia stem cells and the prolif - eration of leukemia cells [ 26 ] . Studies have shown that MEIS1 is often up - regulated in AML patients and can participate in disease progression through a variety of mechanisms [ 27 , 28 ] . Thorsteinsdottir , U . et al . high - lighted the role of Meis1 in regulating human AML cell maintenance and survival in vitro knockdown experi - ments [ 29 ] . Similar to the above study is that our study has also found evidence that MEIS1 expression is associ - ated with AML prognosis , immunity , etc . , which further proves that MEIS1 may be a biomarker for predicting AML prognosis . Dynamins 1 ( DNM1 ) is a member of the GTP - binding protein family . DNM1 is highly expressed in the nervous system of the human body and can regulate nerve activ - ity [ 30 , 31 ] . Therefore , DNM1 is often reported to play a role in nervous system diseases [ 32 , 33 ] . However , in addition to neurological diseases , more and more stud - ies have shown that DNM1 plays a role in the develop - ment of many cancers [ 34 – 36 ] .

BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2024 ) 24 : 2 found that high expression of DNM1 is an independent prognostic biomarker for poor OS in patients with hepa - tocellular carcinoma [ 36 ] . DNM1 is overexpressed in many lung cancers , enhances the growth , migration , and invasion of cancer cells , and reduces the survival rate of lung cancer patients . Activated DNM1 selectively regu - lates tumor necrosis factor - related apoptosis - inducing ligand ( TRAIL - R2 ) - mediated endocytosis , allowing can - cer cells to escape death [ 37 ] . Based on the above , DNM1 may be used as a biomarker to predict the prognosis of patients with multiple cancers . In this study , we found for the first time evidence that DNM1 is potentially related to the prognosis of AML patients , further indicating that DNM1 plays a potential role in the occurrence and devel - opment of AML , and the specific mechanism of action is worthy of further discussion . At present , there are few reports on Sushi domain - con - taining protein 3 ( SUSD3 ) , mainly focusing on the mech - anism of SUSD3 in the occurrence and development of breast cancer . SUSD3 has extracellular , transmembrane , and cytoplasmic domains . It is highly expressed in breast cancer and estrogen - sensitive tissues such as the liver , breast , myometrium , endometrium , and ovary . Experi - ments have shown that SUSD3 has a higher level of expression in estrogen receptor ( ER ) - positive breast can - cer cells , and estrogen treatment can further increase its Fig . 5 The distribution of important genes screened by each machine learning . The lower left band shows the number of important genes contained in each machine learning type . The points and lines in the lower right corner represent a subset of machine learning events . The eight dots and lines connected simultaneously indicate the common intersection of these eight machine learning events . The number of related genes in each subset is represented in the histogram Page 9 of 15 Cheng et al . BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2024 ) 24 : 2 expression [ 38 ] . SUSD3 has been reported as one of the potential biomarkers for the prognosis of breast cancer [ 39 , 40 ] . This study found for the first time that SUSD3 is potentially related to the prognosis of AML and is expected to be a prognostic marker for AML patients . In addition , we explored potential pathways associ - ated with genes closely related to key genes in the train - ing set through GSEA . Many pathways were found to be potentially related to the development of AML . Previous study has reported that the dysfunction of the typical metabolomics pathway Aminoacyl − tRNA biosynthesis indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction , which leads to a decrease in the detoxification ability of reactive oxy - gen species produced by AML chemotherapy and radio - therapy [ 41 ] . P53 plays a key role in normal and leukemia hematopoiesis and is the core of the complex network of AML - related signaling pathways [ 42 ] . NLRP3 inflam - masome , a major factor in NOD - like receptor signaling pathway , promotes the progression of AML in an IL - 1β - dependent manner . Targeting NLRP3 inflammasome may provide a new therapeutic option for AML [ 43 ] . Based on the above , it can be seen that the potential pathways related to DNM1 , MEIS1 and SUSD3 participate in the occurrence and development of AML . We hypothesized that DNM1 , MEIS1 , and SUSD3 are closely related to the prognosis of AML , which may be mediated by the above pathways . However , the above is only speculation , and further functional verification experiments are needed to explore the mechanism of these three key genes in the occurrence and development of AML . Based on a variety of machine learning , this study has explored three new biomarkers for AML prognosis , Fig . 6 MEIS1 , DNM1 , and SUSD3 gene expression levels in cancers based on TCGA and GTEx .

BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making ( 2024 ) 24 : 2 which provides a new idea for the clinical development of individualized targeted therapy and prognosis predic - tion of AML . However , this study still has some short - comings . First , all the analyses in this study are based on retrospective data in public databases , and large - scale prospective studies and additional functional verifica - tion experiments are needed to confirm our findings . Secondly , it is necessary to further explore the specific mechanism of the three key genes in AML and their influence on the prognosis of AML in future research , so as to better explore the molecular mechanism involved in tumorigenesis and AML development . Conclusion This study found that DNM1 , MEIS1 , and SUSD3 were abnormally expressed in AML and were potentially related to its prognosis . They are expected to become new biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for predicting the prognosis of AML patients . This study will provide a new theoretical basis for the basic research of AML .
