While previous research has examined public perceptions of AI in general , there is a notable lack in research focused on CAs , with fewer investigations into cultural variations in CA perceptions . To address this gap , this study used computational methods to analyze about one million social media discussions surrounding CAs and compared people’s discourses and perceptions of CAs in the US and China . We ￿ nd Chinese participants tended to view CAs hedonically , perceived voice - based and physically embodied CAs as warmer and more competent , and generally expressed positive emotions . In contrast , US participants saw CAs more functionally , with an ambivalent attitude . Warm perception was a key driver of positive emotions toward CAs in both countries . We discussed practical implications for designing contextually sensitive and user - centric CAs to resonate with various users’ preferences and needs . CCS CONCEPTS • Human - centered computing !

These computer programs are de - signed to engage users through natural language , operating via text , voice , or both , creating the illusion of human - like conver - sation . Across various scenarios in our world , CAs have served a myriad of roles spanning from customer support , and human resources to mental health care [ 33 , 113 ] . According to a recent industry report , the global chatbot market size reached USD 0 . 84 billion in 2022 and is projected to expand to around USD 4 . 9 bil - lion by 2032 [ 88 ] . Despite the growing market and user base of CAs , public understanding of this emerging technology remains ambiguous , characterized by mixed sentiments and attitudes . Pre - vious HCI studies have developed some understanding of public perceptions around CAs . For example , people’s perceptions and expectations of these non - human agents can be in ￿ uenced by the design features of the CAs , the unique characteristics of individual users , and the contexts and scenarios in which CAs were deployed and embraced [ 3 , 35 , 51 , 91 , 117 ] . While these studies have provided valuable insights , much of our current understanding is based on the examination of speci ￿ c CA products that may be idiosyncratic due to their unique features [ 85 , 100 ] , or domain - speci ￿ c CAs with particular applications [ 97 , 98 ] . We therefore focus both on the cultural contexts and the techni - cal characteristics of di ￿ erent types of CA to gain insight into the cross - cultural and cross - feature variations in people’s discourses and perceptions of CAs . Given that human perceptions of an entity often involve complex cognitive and a ￿ ective processes , especially when encountering novel and sophisticated technologies such as chatbots , it’s necessary to use a multidimensional framework . This approach helps avoid oversimpli ￿ cation or misrepresentation in capturing people’s perceptions of CAs . In the evaluation of human perceptions and cognitions , warmth , competence , and emotional valence are commonly considered as key dimensions that character - ize di ￿ erent aspects of social cognitions [ 61 ] . Warmth is a crucial aspect in evaluating the degree of human - likeness in non - human entities [ 1 ] . It is linked to the emotional value a CA holds for its users [ 7 ] , and can predict trust , believability , and the willingness to engage with CAs [ 15 , 84 ] . Competence , on the other hand , is closely associated with utilitarian and functional aspects [ 7 , 116 ] . It denotes how e ￿ ectively a CA responds to requests based on its knowledge , skills , and communication adequacy [ 74 ] . Competence CHI ’24 , May 11 – 16 , 2024 , Honolulu , HI , USA Zihan Liu , Han Li , Anfan Chen , Renwen Zhang , and Yi - Chieh Lee often factors into assessments of functionality and usability and has been associated with customer satisfaction and persuasiveness of promotional messages [ 114 ] . Emotional valence , in contrast , rep - resents a broader emotional tone underlying people’s perceptions and experiences with CAs , contributing to an overall impression of CA perceptions . To understand the impact of culture and technical characteris - tics on public perceptions of CAs in terms of warmth , competence , and emotional valence , we selected two well - known social media platforms in the United States ( Twitter ) and China ( Sina Weibo ) as primary research sites . Both platforms are among the most promi - nent social media sites in their respective countries . By focusing on these two countries , our study aims to understand the cultural dif - ferences in public perceptions of CAs between West and East Asia . While both the United States ( US ) and China are leading players in the AI domain , the socio - cultural contexts they operate within are markedly di ￿ erent . For example , the US , characterized by its indi - vidualistic culture , often prioritizes e ￿ ciency and achievement . On the contrary , China’s collectivistic culture places greater emphasis on community ties and kinship [ 48 , 106 ] . These core cultural val - ues can potentially shape how CAs are perceived in terms of their competence and warmth [ 77 , 89 ] . Drawing from Hofstede’s con - cept of uncertainty avoidance [ 48 ] , Shin et al . [ 98 ] have noted that cultural values play a role in people’s acceptance of chatbots and the qualities they appreciate in them . Therefore , the cross - cultural comparison between the US and China presents a rich ground to delve into the interplay of culture and technology in in ￿ uencing public perceptions of CAs . Unlike traditional approaches that employ surveys , interviews , or experiments to study people’s perceptions and experiences with technology , we used topic modeling and word embedding tech - niques to analyze a substantial corpus of real - world social media discourses related to CAs over a ￿ ve - year period ( 2017 - 2023 ) . By leveraging these computational methods , we aim to enhance schol - arly understanding of public perceptions of CAs , both in terms of breadth and depth . As social media serves as a rich source of diverse voices , featuring not only real - time debates but also long - term nar - ratives and portrayals . This approach allows us to capture a broader spectrum of opinions and emotions and provides comprehensive and nuanced insights into how CAs are perceived in the US and China . In summary , we speci ￿ cally contribute : • Insights on how culture and other structural factors shape public perceptions of CAs in warmth , competence and emo - tional valence , by comparing online social media discourses related to CAs in the US and China . • A characterization of high - level technical characteristics that impact public perceptions of CAs , using a categorization framework that incorporates both conversational dynamics and representation of the CAs . • An understanding of the intricate interplay between external structural factors and inherent technical characteristics in shaping the ways CAs are perceived and valued by the public . • Recommendations on designing CAs in ways that are more contextually sensitive and user centric , to address speci ￿ c user needs and preferences and enhance the user experience and acceptance of CAs . 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 Public Perceptions and Discourses of Conversational Agents AI holds the promise of revolutionizing various aspects of society , spanningdomainssuchas healthcare , education , andtransportation , among others . As an emerging technology , with no fully realized and understood potential , the advances of AI bring both hope and fear [ 13 ] . It has been considered both a panacea that promises un - precedented advancements and solutions to complex challenges , and a devil that may threaten humanity , potentially leading to eth - ical and societal dilemmas [ 47 ] . The ￿ ctional representation and popular imagination add another dimension to the enigma and com - plexity of AI , turning it into a hotly debated and controversial topic ever since its inception in the public’s consciousness [ 12 ] . Grasping public perceptions of AI is essential , as it sheds light on the broader discourses , attitudes , thoughts , feelings , and practical applications of this technology among people . Such insights are indispensable to improving design and creating ethical guidelines and frameworks , which serve as foundational pillars in directing AI development toward responsible and transparent practices . Accordingly , many studies have explored the views of the general public on AI , robot - ics , automation , and other associated technological advancements [ 20 , 57 ] . Researchers found that AI is often perceived as a boon for healthcare , o ￿ ering signi ￿ cant improvements [ 115 ] , and as a driver of business bene ￿ ts in various industries [ 26 ] . However , there are also pressing concerns . Notable concerns of AI revolve around job loss , income inequality , loss of human intellectual capabilities , and growing social isolation , among other issues [ 30 , 53 , 57 ] . The complex and ambivalent attitudes and sentiments elicited by AI have also been seen in discussions of CAs , a distinct segment of AI applications . These software programs have the remarkable ability to engage with users through natural language operating through text - based and / or voice - based interfaces [ 95 ] . Being one of the most immediate and intimate touch points between individ - uals and AI technologies , their ubiquitous integration in customer support , healthcare , ￿ nance , smart home , and various other sectors has made them not only tools of convenience but also subjects of scrutiny . Amid the expansive discourses on general AI and ro - botics , existing research on public perceptions of CAs is notably lacking . This presents a signi ￿ cant research gap , especially con - sidering the widespread applications of CAs in the daily lives of millions . While the existing research is valuable , it often narrows in scope , targeting perceptions of CAs in specialized domains such as customer services [ 113 ] , journalism [ 97 ] and healthcare [ 62 ] . Additionally , the emphasis is often placed on speci ￿ c CA products , such as Alexa [ 35 , 85 ] , Replika [ 112 ] , and Xiaoice [ 120 ] . As a re - sult , a comprehensive understanding of public perceptions of CAs remains under - explored . Gaining a deep understanding of people’s perceptions of CAs requires a valid understanding of how these agents can be perceived and interpreted . Historically , warmth ( friendly vs . unfriendly ) , com - petence ( smart vs . dumb ) , and valence ( good vs . bad ) have been key dimensions in conceptualizing social perceptions [ 2 , 32 ] . Of Understanding Public Perceptions of AI Conversational Agents : A Cross - Cultural Analysis CHI ’24 , May 11 – 16 , 2024 , Honolulu , HI , USA these , warmth and competence are universal markers for gaug - ing social cognitions toward both persons and groups . Simply put , warmth gauges traits linked to perceived intent , such as sincerity and trustworthiness , whereas competence assesses attributes asso - ciated with perceived ability , such as intelligence and e ￿ cacy . Nu - merous studies have highlighted their dominant role in accounting for the majority of variance in social perceptions , from approach - avoidance tendencies [ 9 , 82 ] to understanding motives [ 87 ] . While initially framed for human cognitions , warmth and competence have also been used to understand people’s perceptions of non - human entities , such as robots [ 18 ] and chatbots [ 43 , 93 ] . Another important dimension of public perception is valence , re ￿ ecting how one emotionally rates an entity as good or bad . Given the ambigu - ity surrounding CAs , understanding emotional valence becomes crucial . Human perceptions and behaviors toward emerging technolo - gies are highly contextual and culturally dependent [ 64 ] . According to Epley , " di ￿ erences in culture , norms , experience , education , cog - nitive reasoning styles , and attachment " will a ￿ ect user reactions to AI agents [ 28 ] . Shin et al . [ 99 ] examined cross - cultural value structures in user interaction with algorithm - driven chatbot news , revealing evident di ￿ erences between the US and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) . The study highlighted that while US users focused primarily on procedural dimensions related to fairness , account - ability , and transparency ( FAT ) , UAE users were more captivated by the functional performance of the algorithm . Another investigation revealed that Japanese users prioritized the functional qualities of chatbots , in contrast to US users , who valued non - functional algo - rithmic aspects more . As Seaver [ 96 ] stated , although algorithms are inherently technological , they can also be construed as cultural artifacts . Such cultural disparities extend beyond just perceptions , encompassing varying apprehensions and priorities concerning AI chatbots [ 99 ] . The evident contrast in the discourses , attitudes , preferences , and feelings toward CAs among people from diverse cultural backgrounds underscores the need for a cross - cultural lens when probing public perceptions and discourses of CAs . We thus posit the ￿ rst research question : RQ1 : What are the di ￿ erences in the ( a ) discussion themes and ( b ) public perceptions ( i . e . warmth , competence , and emotional valence ) of CAs between the US and China ? 2 . 2 Categorization of Conversational Agents : Conversation and Representation In addition to culture , the category of CAs also plays an impor - tant role in shaping public perceptions . CAs come in various forms based on their design , interaction style , and function . Along di ￿ er - ent axes , previous HCI work has proposed diverse frameworks for categorizing CAs . Grudin and Jacques [ 45 ] , for example , classi ￿ ed chatbots by the depth and breadth of their interactions , resulting in three types : virtual companions , intelligent assistants , and task - oriented chatbots . Følstad et al . [ 34 ] suggested categorization based on interaction duration ( short - term and long - term ) and control lo - cus ( user - driven and chatbot - driven ) . Anchoring more deeply into design techniques and approaches , Hussain et al . [ 50 ] introduced four design dimensions in di ￿ erentiating CAs : interaction mode , knowledge domain , goals , and design approach . The landscape is further enriched by the growing integration of non - embodied conversational agents and dialogue systems into versatile and in - teractive platforms , such as robots and Embodied Conversational Agents ( ECAs ) . The physical and visual representation of these CAs introduces another pivotal layer to CA characterization . Rzepka and Berger [ 94 ] pinpointed the importance of a human - like ap - pearance and physical embodiment in characterizing AI - enabled systems . Such nonverbal attributes a ￿ ord important social presence cues that may in ￿ uence how users perceive and interact with CAs . As suggested by the Modality - Agency - Interactivity - Navigability ( MAIN ) model [ 102 ] , interface cues play a role in shaping user per - ceptions by triggering cognitive heuristics about the nature and substance of the interaction . Although there exist overlaps and discrepancies in these tax - onomies , they yield invaluable insights for categorizing and under - standing CAs based on how they interact with users and represent themselves . This aligns with Cassell’s proposition [ 72 ] that the representation of a system through its interface , along with the manner in which it conveys information to users , are key compo - nents that shape perceptions of intelligence in the design of a CA user interface . Re ￿ ecting on the importance of conversation and representation in chatbot characterization , our study speci ￿ cally focuses on conversational focus , conversational mode , human - like appearance , and physical embodiment for CA categorization as they collectively illuminate the nuanced aspects of CA capabili - ties and attributes in the realm of conversational dynamics and representation . 2 . 2 . 1 Conversational Focus . We adopted Grudin’s framework [ 45 ] to classify CAs based on the depth and breadth of interactions that the CA supports . Virtual companions , like ELIZA and Xiaoice , are known for their ability to engage in extensive conversations . Intelligent assistants , such as Siri and Alexa , although versatile , typ - ically o ￿ er more surface - level interactions . Task - focused chatbots , on the other hand , cater to speci ￿ c tasks , making them ideal for niche applications such as customer support . In this study , we con - centrate on virtual companions and intelligent assistants , as their design mirrors the unstructured , ￿ uid nuances inherent in human conversations , o ￿ ering users with richer interaction opportunities and may thus carry deeper socio - cultural implications . Given their distinct conversational focus , virtual companions and intelligent assistants are likely to elicit varying expectations , perceptions , and experiences from users . For example , Doyle et al . [ 23 ] observed that users often see intelligent assistants ( Siri and Alexa ) as formal , fact - based , impersonal , and less authentic . Drawing insights from real - life expectations and experiences of participants with chatbots , attributes such as high - performance , smart , seamless , personable are identi ￿ ed as crucial elements that make a good assistant [ 118 ] . In a study of six AI virtual assistants’ subreddit discussions , Ng & Lin [ 80 ] pinpointed six salient conversational themes , with the majority leaning toward functional and hedonic grati ￿ cation . On the contrary , virtual companions , such as Replika and Xiaoice , are more endowed with social , emotional , and relational attributes , where a rich set of social and behavioral mechanisms are expected to be exchanged [ 8 ] . 2 . 2 . 2 Conversational Mode . Another pivotal aspect pertaining to the conversational capabilities of a CA is its conversational modality . CHI ’24 , May 11 – 16 , 2024 , Honolulu , HI , USA Zihan Liu , Han Li , Anfan Chen , Renwen Zhang , and Yi - Chieh Lee This involves whether the CA is activated and responds through text , speech , or a combination of both . These modes categorize CAs into voice - based , text - based , or hybrid [ 104 ] . While modal - ity choices largely hinge on the CAs’ intended purpose and the speci ￿ c context of the application , they hold implications for how users perceive and interact with the CAs . As emphasized by Sundar et al . [ 103 ] , modality profoundly a ￿ ects the interaction between users and digital media , shaping user perceptions of content and the media platform itself . Moreover , conversational mode serves as a crucial indicator of a CA’s human - like qualities [ 17 ] . In a recent study that examined participants’ expectations and satisfaction with text - based and voice - based coaching chatbots , Terblanche and Kidd [ 104 ] found that text - based chatbots received higher ratings in terms of performance expectancy , whereas voice - based chat - bots were perceived as easier to use . The introduction of the voice modality in a CA could potentially improve the perceived social presence of the CA , thus fostering favorable attitudes [ 16 ] as well as rapport [ 24 ] . However , this positive reaction may be contingent on a series of contextual factors , for example , the sensitivity of the context [ 104 ] and the cultural background of the users [ 49 , 68 ] . 2 . 2 . 3 Human - like Appearance . Human likeness , also known as anthropomorphism , encompasses the extent to which nonhuman agents resemble human features . This attribute is fundamental in characterizing nonhuman agents , and is in ￿ uenced by a variety of human - like features . It can be conveyed through the perceived self - consciousness and mental state of the chatbots [ 59 ] , the visual cues such as human ￿ gures , identity cues like human - associated names , or conversational cues that involve the emulation of human languages . In essence , human likeness can be manifested both in form and in behavior . Di ￿ erent CAs may be endowed with di ￿ erent degrees of human likeness , thereby engendering positive or neg - ative user reactions [ 31 , 81 ] . These variations in human likeness can extend to social perceptions as well . For example , Roy and Naidoo [ 93 ] found that the anthropomorphic conversation style of chatbots could lead to di ￿ erential social perceptions of users ( that is , competence vs . warmth ) toward chatbots . 2 . 2 . 4 Physical Embodiment . Central to the representation of a CA lies in the physical embodiment . In the realm of HCI , physical em - bodiment pertains to the extent to which a technological entity or agent possesses a physical presence or representation within the physical world [ 60 ] . This encompasses the notion of provid - ing digital or virtual entities with a tangible , interactive form that facilitates engagement with the environment and users . Von der putten et al . [ 107 ] argued that the social in ￿ uence of an autonomous agent strongly relates to the levels of behavioral realism it exhibits . Conversational agents may be embodied or disembodied . In Konto - giorgos et al . ’s work [ 60 ] , the concept of embodiment was applied to social robots and smart speakers . Their study explores the impact of di ￿ erent CA embodiments on users’ perceptions of failures and their subsequent behavior toward CAs . Notably , they found that users rated the social robot embodiment higher in terms of per - ceived intelligence and social presence compared to smart speakers . The e ￿ ects of embodiment are even more pronounced when its form is physical compared to virtual . In a review of 33 experimental studies , Li [ 65 ] found that robot agents that are physically pre - sented were perceived more positively than telepresence in virtual characters . Thus , conversational focus , conversational mode , human - like appearance , and physical embodiment represent important dimen - sions in de ￿ ning a CA in its conversation and representation . Ex - ploring how public perceptions of CAs vary across these de ￿ ning features can help researchers understand how technical characteris - tics play a role in shaping social cognition . Accordingly , we propose the following research questions : RQ2 : How do people’s perceptions of CAs vary by 1 ) con - versational focus ; 2 ) conversational mode ; 3 ) human - like appearance ; and 4 ) physical embodiment ? 2 . 3 Cultural Di ￿ erences in Public Perceptions of Di ￿ erent Conversational Agents Given the notion that users’ understanding of technologies can be socially constructed and culturally shaped [ 83 ] , the same CA can be viewed or experienced di ￿ erently depending on the cultural and social contexts in which they are developed and embraced . Assess - ments and perceptions of di ￿ erent CA characteristics can also vary considerably in di ￿ erent cultural contexts and manifested in the likeability , engagement , trust , and satisfaction of users . An earlier cross - cultural study by Bartneck [ 6 ] revealed cultural variations in how people perceived a robot’s appearance , with the degree of anthropomorphism positively correlated with the likeability of US participants but inversely for their Japanese counterparts . Castelo and Sarvary’s study [ 11 ] , while presenting contrasting results , cor - roborates the existence of a " cross - culturally " uncanny valley phe - nomenon . Their ￿ ndings indicated that increasing human - likeness decreased comfort levels among Americans , but not among Japan - ese participants . Concerning interaction modality , Rie ￿ e et al . [ 91 ] identi ￿ ed signi ￿ cant correlations between users’ characteristics and their experiences with text - and voice - based CAs . Cultural distinctions also manifest in the perceptions of robots with varying communication styles . Rau , Li et al . ’s study [ 86 ] noted German participants’ preferences for explicit communication styles when expressing disagreement , whereas Chinese participants favored implicit approaches . This is consistent with Hall’s cultural context theory [ 46 ] , in which people from high - context cultures tend to prioritize nuanced and indirect forms of expression , while commu - nication is more explicit in low - context cultures . These empirical insights underscore the intricate interplay be - tween culture and technology in shaping how people expect , per - ceive , and experience CAs and other emerging technologies . While the aforementioned studies have endeavored to unravel the dynam - ics between contextual factors , individual characteristics , and tech - nical features , their scope is often con ￿ ned to a speci ￿ c application ( e . g . Alexa ; [ 36 ] ) or certain chatbot characteristics , which makes generalization and meaningful comparison challenging . Thus , it becomes imperative not only to expand research focus from indi - vidual nations or cultures to cross - cultural and cross - nation con - texts , but also to extend the focus from singular products to the characteristics - level of technology across a spectrum of products . To further understand the interaction of culture and technology Understanding Public Perceptions of AI Conversational Agents : A Cross - Cultural Analysis CHI ’24 , May 11 – 16 , 2024 , Honolulu , HI , USA Figure 1 : Analytical framework and RQs in ￿ uence on public perceptions of CAs , we pose the following research questions . RQ3 : How does culture in ￿ uence public perceptions of CAs with di ￿ erent 1 ) conversational focus ; 2 ) conversational mode ; 3 ) human - like appearance ; and 4 ) physical embodi - ment ? Based on the three research questions , we propose our analytical framework as Figure 1 . 3 METHOD 3 . 1 Data Collection Social media landscapes present a proli ￿ c ground for empirical investigation , o ￿ ering a diverse array of voices that represent pub - lic discourses and perceptions on signi ￿ cant topics and issues . In this research , to identify cultural di ￿ erences in perceptions of CAs between the US and China , we focused on Twitter and Sina Weibo ( hereafter as Weibo ) , two popular social media platforms in these two countries , respectively . Both platforms function as microblog - ging services and share common features such as threaded discus - sions , comments , mentions , likes , reposts , and hashtags . As of 2022 , Twitter boasts 238 million daily active users , while Weibo has 252 million daily active users ( Statista , 2022 ; Weibo , 2022 ) . This substan - tial user engagement enables us to collect CA - related discussions from a wide spectrum of users over an extended period , facilitating our computational analysis . We collected publicly available posts from both Twitter and Weibo . Twitter data was accessed via its o ￿ cial API , whereas Weibo’s API limitations led us to utilize its advanced keyword - based search function , following the practices of previous research [ 14 , 73 ] . To compile our data , an iterative keyword discovery approach was employed , starting with the keyword " chatbot " and its Chi - nese equivalent . Two researchers independently open - coded 1 , 000 randomly selected CA - related posts from both platforms , identify - ing frequently associated terms in both English and Chinese . This open - coding process , complemented by collaborative discussions , continued until keyword saturation was reached . To expand the keyword list , we also included names of the top 10 chatbot applica - tions in the US and China based on download statistics from Qimai ( qimai . cn ) , a mobile app analytics tool that has been extensively validated in prior research [ 29 , 109 ] . This expanded our keyword list to include 35 English and 47 Chinese terms , such as " voice as - sistant , " " conversational agent , " " AI companion , " and " chatgpt . " The complete list can be found in the Appendix . We retrieved posts from both platforms that contained any of our identi ￿ ed keywords , covering the period from July 20 , 2017 , to January 30 , 2023 , we also downloaded the associated meta - data ( e . g . timestamp , user ID ) . The selection of the starting date aligns with the introduction of China’s in ￿ uential " New Generation Arti ￿ cial Intelligence Development Plan " , a pivotal strategy for the nation’s AI landscape [ 111 ] . It also corresponds to the period when the US experienced a growth in chatbot numbers and increased human - chatbot engagement [ 4 ] . This timeframe therefore holds particular signi ￿ cance , as it likely witnessed a surge in CA - related discussions in both countries . The endpoint corresponds to the day before our ￿ nal data retrieval . Given that Twitter is a global social media platform , we employed a combination of GPS location and user pro ￿ le data to identify posts originating from the US ( see Appendix ) . Our data retrieval process resulted in a dataset consisting of 755 , 399 tweets and 229 , 990 Weibo posts related to CAs . Following a series of data cleaning steps ( removal of duplicates , posts from o ￿ cial AI application handles [ e . g . " Siri Inc " on Twitter ] , and posts generated by social media bots ) , our ￿ nal dataset was re ￿ ned to include 753 , 807 tweets and 199 , 089 Weibo posts for subsequent data analyses ( A detailed description of the data cleaning process is provided in the Appendix ) . 3 . 2 Ethic Statement This study utilized publicly available tweets and Weibo posts , and it falls within the category of an observational study conducted with retrospectively collected data , without involving any interactions with the creators of the textual contents . Therefore , this study does not meet the criteria for " human subjects research " according to the University Institutional Review Board . Nonetheless , for ethical considerations , we have adhered to best practices in data collection , analysis , and reporting . This included working with data that does not contain personally identi ￿ able information and paraphrasing the original textual content in our report to ensure that it cannot be traced back to the original authors . 3 . 3 Data Analysis : Topic Modeling To answer RQ1 ( a ) , which explores the topics of discussion to gain in - sight into public discourses related to CAs , we employed BERTopic , an advanced topic modeling technique that leverages BERT - based deep learning models for topic modeling and clustering . We chose BERTopic due to its remarkable e ￿ ectiveness and high performance in decoding social media data , which is often characterized by brevity and lack of structure , posing challenges for many conven - tional topic modeling approaches like LDA [ 27 , 44 ] . 3 . 3 . 1 Data Pre - processing . Prior to the analysis of the topic mod - eling , we cleaned the data using the natural language packages ( NLTK ; Natural Language Toolkit , https : / / www . nltk . org / ) imple - mented in Python . This text pre - processing involved the following CHI ’24 , May 11 – 16 , 2024 , Honolulu , HI , USA Zihan Liu , Han Li , Anfan Chen , Renwen Zhang , and Yi - Chieh Lee steps : removal of URLs , stopwords , punctuation , special characters , user mentions ( e . g . , @ username ) , hyperlinks , emojis , and the term " RT " for tweets ; removal of search keywords ; and stemming and lemmatization of the words ( transforming words like " created " to " create " ) . 3 . 3 . 2 Selection of Topic Number . Since there is no de ￿ nitive answer to the appropriate number of topics in topic modeling , we adopted a practical approach based on a guideline suggested by [ 101 ] . We select 60 - 100 topics as a suitable starting point , taking into account our medium - sized corpora ( 10k to 100k documents ) . To re ￿ ne the topic number , we systematically varied it within the speci ￿ ed range , using increments of 5 . We then assessed each model’s performance by calculating its coherence score , a well - established metric for evaluating the coherence and interpretability of topics in a topic model [ 75 ] . Finally , we chose the topic number that yielded the highest coherence score . This process strikes a balance between granularity and interpretability to extract meaningful insights from our data . 3 . 3 . 3 ￿ alitative Coding . Following prior practices [ 39 , 41 ] , we employed an open - coding approach to interpret the results of the topic modeling . Initially , two researchers independently identi ￿ ed open codes by closely reading and familiarizing themselves with the topics generated by BERTopic . These ￿ rst - level codes were derived based on the top 10 keywords and a random selection of 30 represen - tative posts associated with each topic . Next , the two researchers and three other researchers collectively discussed these ￿ rst - level codes . They compared the codes , resolved any disagreements , and aggregated the ￿ rst - level codes into higher - level sub - themes by combining similar codes into broader categories . Two researchers then engaged in collective discussions , utilizing these well - de ￿ ned sub - themes as a coding framework to categorize each topic accord - ingly . Finally , the identi ￿ ed sub - themes were aggregated into ￿ ve overarching meta - themes through collaborative discussions among the ￿ ve researchers . 3 . 4 Data Analysis : Word Embedding To address our research questions concerning public perceptions of CAs in terms of warmth , competence , and emotional valence ( RQ1 ( b ) , RQ2 , RQ3 ) , we utilized word embedding techniques to examine the degree to which individuals associated CAs with words and concepts related to warmth , competence , and emotional valence . This approach has been widely employed in previous studies to examine people’s social cognition and attitudes , demonstrating high performance and accuracy [ 5 ] . 3 . 4 . 1 CA Categorization . To answer RQ 2 and RQ 3 , which fo - cus on the di ￿ erences in technical characteristics of the CAs , we categorized all mentioned CA products in our data corpus and clas - si ￿ ed them into di ￿ erent types based on their conversational focus , conversational mode , human - like appearance , and physical embodi - ment . Table 1 summarizes the CA products and their categorization in the US and China . 3 . 4 . 2 Key Algorithm : S - WEAT . The key algorithm employed in word embedding is S - WEAT [ 61 ] , an adapted version of the Word Table 1 : Categorization of CA products based on technical characteristics Note : The results of our classi ￿ cation based on the presence of human - like appearance and conversation focus are entirely identical . As a result , we have combined them and will discuss them together in the subsequent sections . Embedding Association Test ( WEAT ) , which was designed to mea - sure the relative association of a single category to each attribute in an opposed pair . Each S – WEAT analysis compared two bipolar attributes ( e . g . , " warm " versus " cold " ) against a single category related to CAs , such as " CAs with human - like appearances . " Speci ￿ cally , we started by calculating the average cosine similarity between the CA category and each attribute . Next , we calculated the di ￿ erence value between the two mean cosine similarity scores . The resultant positive values indicate a stronger similarity between the group category and the positive attribute ( e . g . positive , warm , and competent ) while nega - tive values indicate a higher similarity between the group category and the negative attribute ( e . g . negative , cold , and incompetent ) . To ensure comparability , we normalized these di ￿ erence values to a range spanning from - 2 to + 2 . This normalization was achieved by dividing the di ￿ erence values by a pooled standard deviation . The standard deviation was calculated from the mean cosine simi - larity scores for each attribute word vector across both attribute categories . The formula below demonstrates the calculation of the S - WEAT statistic : Let A and B be the two sets of opposing attribute category word vectors of equal size , and let X be the set of social group category word vectors . Let cos ( Æ 0 , Æ G ) express the cosine of the angle between the two vectors Æ 0 and Æ G . The S – WEAT statistic is then de ￿ ned by : B ( - ,   , ⌫ ) = < 40 = 0 2   B ( 0 , - )   < 40 = 1 2 ⌫ B ( 1 , - ) BC3 3 4E F 2   [ ⌫ B ( F , - ) where B ( 0 , - ) = < 40 = G 2 - cos ( Æ 0 , Æ G ) 3 . 4 . 3 Calculation Procedure . Technically , we trained custom word embedding models in our CA - centric corpus using Word2Vec via the Gensim library in Python . These models distill intricate lexical semantics into a constrained dimensional space . We then applied S – WEAT . Dictionaries that represent our six attribute categories ( refer to the Appendix for complete dictionaries and sample posts ) were sourced from prior study [ 61 ] . After mapping attribute words and CA products in our trained word embedding model and getting vectors representing them , we performed S - WEAT on these vectors . Understanding Public Perceptions of AI Conversational Agents : A Cross - Cultural Analysis CHI ’24 , May 11 – 16 , 2024 , Honolulu , HI , USA Table 2 : Prevalence of meta - themes in the US and China Note : Count refers to the number of posts / tweets in each meta - theme ; Percent denotes the proportion of each meta - theme across the dataset . The numerical results represent the association between a cer - tain category of CA products and a certain attribute . If the value is greater than zero , a stronger correlation with positive attributes ( i . e . warm , competent , or positive ) is observed as the absolute value increases . Conversely , if the value is less than zero , a stronger corre - lation with negative attributes ( i . e . cold , incompetent , or negative ) is observed as the absolute value increases . To address the inherent variability and randomness associated with this methodology , we implemented a bootstrap procedure with a 90 % sampling rate , conducting it 50 times . Subsequently , we calculated the average similarities , following the established recommendations of previous research [ 92 ] . 4 RESULT 4 . 1 Topic Modeling of Discussion Themes of CAs in the US and China To address RQ1 ( a ) , we conducted a BERTopic analysis to uncover the major themes of public discourses surrounding CAs in the two countries . Our topic model resulted in 80 topics ( coherence score = 0 . 47 ) generated from the Twitter corpus and 95 topics ( coherence score = 0 . 57 ) generated from the Weibo corpus ( refer to Appendix for full lists of topics ) . We excluded the topics labeled as " - 1 " in both datasets , which included posts that could not be assigned a speci ￿ c topic in the model . Following our qualitative coding process , we categorized these topics into meso - level sub - themes . These sub - themes were then clustered into macro - level meta - themes to facilitate meaningful comparisons ( i . e . convergence and divergence ) . Across both coun - tries , we identi ￿ ed ￿ ve overarching meta - themes : individual in - teractions and experiences , technical aspects of CA , industrial de - velopment and applications , socio - cultural events and issues , and political issues . Table 2 displays aggregated statistics for each meta - theme in the US and China . 4 . 1 . 1 Individual Interactions and Experiences . In both countries , discussions related to users’ individual interactions and experiences dominate , accounting for 65 . 1 % of the tweets and 62 % of the Weibo posts . This meta - theme involves CA - related discussions from a personal perspective and covers users’ real - life interactions with the CA and their associated experiences and emotions . Within this meta - theme , there exist three distinct sub - themes : " task - oriented in - teraction " , " social - oriented interaction " , and " experience & opinion " . Table 3 summarizes this meta - theme and its sub - themes , along with top keywords , representative posts , and the count and percentage of posts belonging to each sub - theme . Task - oriented interaction encompasses posts in which users re - quest the CAs to perform speci ￿ c daily tasks , such as setting alarms or adjusting smart home settings , and includes terms like " play " , " song " , " alarm " , " wake " , and " reminder " . Notably , task - oriented in - teractions were more prominent in the US , representing 44 . 2 % of tweets , while this ￿ gure was much lower in China , accounting for only 10 . 9 % of Weibo posts . This disparity suggests that US users primarily engage with CAs for functional and utilitarian purposes , relying on them to streamline daily tasks . In contrast , Chinese users exhibited a stronger inclination toward social - oriented interactions , where they engage with CAs in a more conversational and emo - tionally expressive manner , with representative terms like " ￿ irt " , " joke " , and " tease " . These social - oriented interactions constituted 16 . 8 % of the discussions in China , while only 3 . 7 % of tweets in the US . This clear distinction highlights an intriguing di ￿ erence in how users use and interact with CAs in their daily lives . Chinese users appear to lean toward more social and hedonic use of CAs , while US users tend to engage with them in a more utilitarian manner . In addition to the speci ￿ c interactions with the CA , we also iden - ti ￿ ed a substantial number of posts related to users expressing their emotions , attitudes , and thoughts toward the CA , both positively and negatively . We categorized this as " experience & opinion " , with top terms such as " useful " , " cute " , and " love " . Chinese users were notably more likely to share such experiences and opinions , with 34 . 3 % of their posts falling into this category , compared to 17 . 3 % of the tweets among the US users . 4 . 1 . 2 Industrial Development and Applications . Another prominent meta - theme that warrants attention in discussions from both coun - tries revolves around the industrial advancements and practical applications associated with CAs ( Table 4 ) . In total , this sub - theme accounts for 24 . 3 % of tweets in the US and 21 . 4 % of Weibo posts in China . Three sub - themes were clustered in this meta - theme : " in - dustry trend " , " application in context " and " chatbot development " . In China , discussions related to industry trends dominated this meta - theme , characterized by conversations about the economic potential and trajectory of the CA industry and its impact on vari - ous sectors of society . These discussions account for 13 . 8 % of Weibo posts , indicated by terms like " arti ￿ cial " , " dollar " , and " openai " . Con - versely , in the US , " chatbot development " emerged as a prominent sub - theme , comprising 8 . 8 % of the tweet corpus . This sub - theme focused on discussions regarding speci ￿ c chatbot development and innovations within the industry . Topics included user base growth or the market share of speci ￿ c CA products , as suggested by terms like " voice " , " apple " , " wwdc " , " rank " , and " statistic " . Both China and the US engaged in discussions related to the practical application of CAs in various use contexts , such as CAs’ integration into smart homes , mental health care , and ￿ nancial applications . Example terms included " iot " , " ￿ ntech " , and " medi - tation " . While this sub - theme was present in both countries , US users contributed more to these discussions , accounting for 15 . 5 % , compared to 7 . 6 % among Chinese users . In summary , concerning CHI ’24 , May 11 – 16 , 2024 , Honolulu , HI , USA Zihan Liu , Han Li , Anfan Chen , Renwen Zhang , and Yi - Chieh Lee Table 3 : Discussion themes in the US and China : individual interactions and experiences Note : Prevalence refers to the proportion of the posts / tweets within each sub - theme across the dataset . industrial development and applications , Chinese discussions pri - marily focused on high - level industry trends and potentials , while US discussions were more inclined to speci ￿ c CA products and applications . 4 . 1 . 3 Technical Aspects of CA . In comparison to discussions related to individual - level interactions and industrial - level development , the third meta - theme , " technical aspects of CA " ( Table 5 ) , accounts for a smaller proportion in both countries . This meta - theme encom - passed discussions related to various topics in technical functional - ities , issues , resources , and more at the CA level , with 8 % of tweets focusing on it in the US and 5 . 5 % of Weibo posts in China . Within this meta - theme , " functionality and attributes " contains discussions related to speci ￿ c functionalities and technical attributes of CAs , with sample terms like " shortcut " , " accent " , " math " and " battery " . Users in both China and the US engaged in these discussions , with 5 . 5 % of Weibo posts in China and 6 . 4 % in the US . In addition , a small proportion ( 1 . 6 % ) of the discussions in the US pertained to topics involving technical knowledge and resources related to CAs . These tweets included information about sharing platforms , tutorials for chatbot coding and development , and useful tips for better CA use , with sample terms like " Microsoft " , " build " , " command " and " deploying " . No similar topics were identi ￿ ed in Chinese discussions . 4 . 1 . 4 Socio - cultural Events and Issues . Another relatively small meta - theme in both countries was " socio - cultural events and issues " ( Table 6 ) . Despite its limited discussion , this meta - theme exhibited interesting divergence between China and the US . We grouped all topics related to socio - cultural events and issues of CAs in this category , covering a wide range of topics ranging from trending social events to CA - related legal and ethical issues . Approximately 11 . 1 % of the Weibo posts fell into this category , while this num - ber was much smaller on Twitter ( 0 . 4 % ) . Within this overarching meta - theme , we further categorized topics into three sub - themes : " popular culture " , " social events " , and " legal & ethical issues " . " Popular culture " - related discussions often linked CAs with elements of pop culture , such as movies , TV series , or celebrities , including terms like " fashion " , " Blade Runner " , and " Spiderman " . For example , fans of the Korean boy band " BTS " shared posts about BTS’s songs being featured on Siri’s playlists . This sub - theme was present more prominently in China , with approximately 4 . 6 % of Weibo posts , compared to 0 . 04 % of tweets in the US . There were also some CA - related entertainment trending social events and topics that emerged on Weibo , such as " Hangzhou Uncle Jealous Wife Addicts to Virtual Boyfriend " , which was categorized into the sub - theme " social events " , and accounted for 5 . 1 % Weibo posts . This type of discussion was relatively small in the US ( 0 . 3 % ) , with a di ￿ erent focus , such as the advocates of raising awareness about global warming . Within this meta - theme , we also identi ￿ ed the sub - theme " le - gal & ethical issues " . Although it represented a rather minimal proportion of the overall discussion , it holds signi ￿ cance in un - derstanding the broader implications of CAs in di ￿ erent societies . There emerged discussions related to the legal and ethical concerns raised by CAs , including issues like AI rebellion , privacy concerns , and patent problems . In China , this sub - theme accounted for 1 . 4 % Weibo posts , while in the US , it made up only 0 . 05 % of tweets . 4 . 1 . 5 Political Issues . We identi ￿ ed an interesting meta - theme — " political issues " — alongside individual , industrial , technological , and socio - cultural themes , surfaced exclusively in the US , com - prising 2 . 2 % of the tweets analyzed ( Table 7 ) . These discussions primarily involved users expressing their political attitudes and opinions by sharing their interactions with CAs , such as asking Siri about political - related provocative questions .

Table 5 : Discussion themes in the US and China : technical aspects of CA Note : Prevalence refers to the proportion of the posts / tweets within each sub - theme across the dataset . 4 . 2 Word Embedding Insights : Warmth , Competence and Emotional Valence across Culture and Technical Characteristics 4 . 2 . 1 Results for RQ1 ( b ) : Public Perceptions of CAs between the US and China . To address RQ1 ( b ) , we leveraged word embedding techniques to explore how people perceived these CAs di ￿ erently . Figure 2 provides a summary of our word embedding results con - cerning CA perceptions of warmth , competence , and emotional valence between the US and China . In terms of warmth perception , individuals in the US displayed a notably higher association score of 0 . 895 , compared to China’s score of 0 . 223 . This suggests that American participants tended to attribute a greater degree of warmth to CAs , perceiving them as more friendly and warm . Similarly , regarding competence percep - tion , CAs were perceived as more competent in the US , with a score of 1 . 229 , compared to China ( - 0 . 072 ) . This dimension gauges the extent to which people perceive the CA as e ￿ ective and capable . Interestingly , when it comes to emotional valence , a noteworthy contrast emerges . While people in the US perceived CAs as both warm and competent , their emotional orientation toward them was Figure 2 : Public perceptions of CAs in the US and China Note : The colors in the ￿ gure indicate the direction of associations , with green representing a tendency toward positive ( warm , competent , positive ) , and red indicating a tendency toward negative ( cold , incompetent , negative ) .

In contrast , in China , people associated CAs with a more positive tone ( 0 . 265 ) , despite perceiving them as less competent . 4 . 2 . 2 Results for RQ2 : Public Perceptions of CAs across Di ￿ er - ent Technical Characteristics . In RQ2 , based on our categorization of CAs in conversational focus , conversational mode , human - like CHI ’24 , May 11 – 16 , 2024 , Honolulu , HI , USA Zihan Liu , Han Li , Anfan Chen , Renwen Zhang , and Yi - Chieh Lee Table 6 : Discussion themes in the US and China : socio - cultural events and issues Note : Prevalence refers to the proportion of the posts / tweets within each sub - theme across the dataset . Table 7 : Discussion themes in the US and China : political issues Note : Prevalence refers to the proportion of the posts / tweets within each sub - theme across the dataset . appearance , and physical embodiment , we explored how public per - ceptions of CAs may vary across di ￿ erent technical characteristics regardless of culture . Figure 3 presented the word embedding results for these di ￿ erent technical characteristics of the CAs . Within each perception dimension , we found that people’s perceptions of CAs remained relatively consistent and did not show evident di ￿ erences across di ￿ erent technical characteristics . In general , people in the US and China perceived CAs as warm , positive , but less competent . In terms of the speci ￿ c technical characteristics , virtual compan - ions were most strongly associated with warmth ( 0 . 598 ) , physically embodied CAs were linked to a more positive tone ( 0 . 778 ) , and CAs without physical embodiment were associated with the lowest competence ( - 0 . 529 ) . These ￿ ndings lead to one interesting observation : there appears to be a co - vary relationship between people’s warmth perception and their emotional valence as well as their competence perception and their emotional valence . To test this assumption , we conducted a follow - up analysis to examine the associations between warmth , competence , and emotional valence . Our results con ￿ rmed a signi ￿ - cant positive association between warmth perception and emotional valence ( r = 0 . 891 , p = 0 . 017 , 95 % CI = [ 0 . 288 , 0 . 988 ] ) . However , we did not ￿ nd a signi ￿ cant association between competence perception and emotional valence ( r = 0 . 05 , p = 0 . 924 , 95 % CI = [ - 0 . 794 , 0 . 828 ] ) , nor a signi ￿ cant association between warmth and competence ( r = 0 . 225 , p = 0 . 668 , 95 % CI = [ - 0 . 718 , 0 . 876 ] ) . 4 . 2 . 3 Results for RQ3 : The Dual Impacts of Culture and Technology on Public Perceptions of CAs . Our RQ3 delves into the cultural distinctions in public perceptions of CAs with di ￿ erent technical characteristics . Figure 4 summarizes the word embedding results , highlighting the variations in how people perceived di ￿ erent types of CAs in the US and China .

The depth of the color re ￿ ects the strength of the association , with lighter shades indicating greater neutrality and darker shades indicating more extreme associations . In terms of CAs’ conversational mode , voice - based CAs were perceived as warmer ( 0 . 416 ) in China but less warm ( - 0 . 156 ) in the US when compared to text - based CAs . Conversely , text - based CAs were seen as more competent ( 0 . 856 ) in China but less competent ( - 0 . 822 ) in the US . In both countries , voice - based CAs were perceived as more positive than text - based ones . Regarding CAs’ physical embodiment , Chinese participants perceived physically embodied CAs as high in warmth ( 0 . 639 ) and positive tone ( 0 . 865 ) , whereas US participants perceived them as less warm ( - 0 . 48 ) compared to CAs without physical embodiment . Moreover , CAs with physical embodiment were perceived as less competent ( - 1 . 09 ) in the US , while in China , CAs without embodiment were seen as incompetent ( - 0 . 388 ) . Considering that the products categorized as virtual compan - ions also feature a human - like appearance , while those categorized as intelligent assistants lack a human - like appearance . We com - bined these two categorizations for data analysis . In both countries , virtual companions were perceived as warmer ( US : 0 . 291 ; China : 0 . 552 ) than intelligent assistants . When assessing competence , how - ever , Chinese participants perceived virtual companions as highly competent ( 0 . 881 ) , whereas US participants perceived intelligent assistants as less competent ( - 0 . 681 ) . Additionally , Chinese partici - pants expressed positive emotions toward both types of CAs , while US participants showed more neutral emotions . 5 DISCUSSION As various types of CAs become increasingly integrated into peo - ple’s daily lives and take on diverse roles in a variety of cultural contexts , understanding public perceptions of CAs and the fac - tors that shape these perceptions and experiences is of crucial importance . In this paper , we explore the topic di ￿ erences in public discussions of CAs and the role of culture and technical charac - teristics in in ￿ uencing public perceptions of CAs across three key dimensions : warmth , competence , and emotional valence . Through a comprehensive computational analysis of nearly one million so - cial media posts related to CAs on Twitter and Weibo , we ￿ nd that people in the US and China strikingly di ￿ er in both the topics they discuss and the perceptions they hold toward CAs . These cultural di ￿ erences in CA perceptions also vary depending on the technical Figure 4 : Public perceptions of CAs across technical charac - teristics : US vs . China .

The depth of the color re ￿ ects the strength of the association , with lighter shades indicating greater neutrality and darker shades indicating more extreme associations . characteristics of CAs themselves , highlighting the intricate inter - play between external cultural contexts and the inherent technical characteristics in shaping how individuals perceive CAs . Further - more , we ￿ nd that beyond culture , other structural factors like political and economic contexts also shape how CAs are discussed and perceived . This underscores the need for a more comprehensive framework in assessing and comparing public perceptions of emerg - ing technologies like CAs . Such a framework should go beyond a simple cross - cultural comparison and take account of a variety of structural and individual factors . In the following sections , we dive deeper into our primary ￿ ndings and discuss their practical impli - cations for the design and deployment of contextually sensitive and user - centric CAs . 5 . 1 The Role and Interplay of Culture and Technology in Shaping Public Perceptions of CAs One signi ￿ cant ￿ nding revealed by our study is the pronounced divergence in how people in the US and in China may interact with CAs . Chinese users tended to approach CAs in a more social and emotionally expressive way , whereas US users adopted a more task - focused way in their interactions . Interestingly , among Chi - nese users , a substantial proportion of discussions centered around the hedonic and socio - emotional use of intelligent assistants like Siri , even though these CAs were initially designed for utilitarian purposes . A plausible explanation for this trend may be rooted CHI ’24 , May 11 – 16 , 2024 , Honolulu , HI , USA Zihan Liu , Han Li , Anfan Chen , Renwen Zhang , and Yi - Chieh Lee in the spiritual underpinnings of Chinese culture , speci ￿ cally the concept of technological animism [ 90 ] . This belief is shared with many other East Asian cultures and centers around the idea that non - human entities , including machines or arti ￿ cial intelligence , can possess a soul or spirit [ 52 ] . As such , the cultural value of tech - nological animism may encourage Chinese users to perceive CAs , especially those with more anthropomorphic features , as entities with emotions , making them capable of forming emotional bonds and becoming good companions capable of building rapport . This stands in stark contrast to the perspective of Western individuals , who typically view non - human agents like CAs as tools designed to serve human purposes . In Western cultures , humans are seen as unique beings with distinct di ￿ erences from non - human entities [ 42 , 55 , 63 ] . An early study by Clark et al . [ 19 ] also corroborated this notion , suggesting a marked di ￿ erence in the way Western participants discussed having conversations with agents compared to conversations with other people . In particular , conversations with agents were consistently described in functional terms , under - scoring the utilitarian nature of these interactions . In terms of public perceptions , we observed that while partic - ipants in the US expressed less positive emotions overall , they exhibited higher levels of warmth and competence perception of the CAs compared to Chinese participants . A plausible explanation for this seemingly paradoxical result lies in the concept of cog - nitive ambivalence [ 105 ] . In the US , while participants perceived CAs as warm and competent , they may also experience a sense of threat stemming from the human - like characteristics of these non - human agents . Prior studies on cross - cultural robot perceptions have found that human - like characteristics of robots tended to pro - voke a more pronounced challenge to humanness within Western cultures compared to East Asian cultures [ 42 , 56 ] . Therefore , the increasing warmth and competence perception , which are two key determinants of a non - human agent’s human - likeness [ 93 ] , may inadvertently heighten the perception of the " uncanny valley " [ 76 ] in American participants . This , in turn , contributes to a general trend of more negative attitudes toward CAs in the US . We also noticed an interesting trend in Chinese participants’ perceptions of virtual companions ( also with human - like appear - ances ) . They tended to perceive virtual companions as both highly warm and highly competent , in stark contrast to their perceptions of intelligent assistants ( also lacking human - like appearances ) . This pattern suggests the presence of a " halo e ￿ ect " associated with the warmth perception of virtual companions among Chinese partic - ipants . According to the " halo e ￿ ect " , a high perceived warmth can lead to more positive judgments of other traits [ 1 , 54 ] . There - fore , the elevated warmth attributed to virtual companions may spill over into assessments of their competence , resulting in higher evaluations of both dimensions . Conversely , in the US , while vir - tual companions were also perceived as warmer than intelligent assistants , they were concurrently considered as less competent , aligning with the often observed compensatory relationship be - tween warmth and competence in human perceptions [ 58 ] . When assessing a CA’s conversational mode and embodiment , Chinese participants tended to perceive voice - based CAs and those with physical embodiment as warmer compared to text - based CAs and those without embodiment . This preference among Chinese users aligns with their cultural inclination to anthropomorphize technology [ 21 , 38 ] . Verbal communication encompasses more than mere words ; it includes rich , human - like nuances and emotional cues , making these interfaces feel warmer [ 10 , 24 , 71 ] . Previous HCI studies have shown that text communication is often seen as less natural and warm compared to oral communication [ 78 ] , which can lead to a reduced sense of anthropomorphism . Just as with modal - ity , anthropomorphism may serve as the underlying mechanism accounting for Chinese participants’ favorable evaluations toward physically embodied CAs . It’s worth noting that in our study , all physically embodied CAs took the form of smart speakers . While their morphological resemblance to living entities is minimal , their presence in a users’ space , even with limited mobility or nonver - bal cues , can imbue them with a sense of being " alive " in certain ways [ 40 ] . Previous HCI research has observed that users often personify these smart speakers , such as using personal pronouns or attributing gender to them [ 69 , 85 ] . However , in the US , physically embodied CAs were considered as less warm and competent . The divergent perceptions surrounding the CA embodiment between the US and China highlight an important area for future explo - ration . Current design and research of CAs predominantly focus on their conversational attributes , while the form and embodiment of CAs , which can signi ￿ cantly in ￿ uence user experiences , often receive less attention . Therefore , it is essential for future studies and designs to consider the impact of CA embodiment on user perceptions , particularly across di ￿ erent cultural contexts and user populations . 5 . 2 Moving Beyond Culture : Contextualizing Public Perceptions of CAs in Structures While cultural values and norms play a crucial role in account - ing for the variations in the perceptions of CAs between the US and China , we recognize the potential in ￿ uence of other structural factors , including political - economic and technological systems . Notably , on Weibo , discussions related to CAs tended to be more abstract and strategic , often encompassing discourses related to broader industrial developments and trends . This inclination may largely be attributed to government policy and strategy , as well as the portrayal of AI in the mainstream media . A recent study [ 119 ] comparing public discussions of AI on WeChat with the o ￿ cial AI narratives on People’s Daily in China also observed the surprising similarity between social media discussions and mainstream media narratives . Both feature dominant discussions about the economic potential of the technology , along with strongly positive evalua - tions and little critical debate . This top - down pattern observed in public discourses echoes the ambitious goals of the Chinese govern - ment , which aims to establish itself as a global leader in AI by 2030 [ 20 ] . This governmental in ￿ uence might also explain why Chinese users generally hold more positive attitudes toward CAs compared to their American counterparts . Previous global surveys have con - sistently shown that people from Western countries often exhibit more skeptical or negative attitudes toward chatbots , robots , and AI , in contrast to participants from China [ 37 , 79 ] . This divergence in attitudes can be attributed to the supportive environment for AI technologies cultivated by the Chinese government and reinforced by mainstream media , as evidenced in the extensive discussions and a notable positivity surrounding the industrial potential of Understanding Public Perceptions of AI Conversational Agents : A Cross - Cultural Analysis CHI ’24 , May 11 – 16 , 2024 , Honolulu , HI , USA AI in the topic modeling analysis of the discourses . In contrast , discussions related to the industrial implications of CAs in the US exhibited a more contextualized pattern , with a signi ￿ cant empha - sis on practical market applications and business development . This bottom - up approach aligns with the market - responsive nature of AI development in the US [ 25 , 110 ] and re ￿ ects the role of market forces and entrepreneurial endeavors in shaping public discourses of emerging technologies in the US . Another notable di ￿ erence in discourses between the US and China pertains to political - and societal - related discussions of CAs . In contrast to the more entertainment - oriented discussions of CAs ( e . g . pop cultures and comical trending events ) in China , discussions in the US tended to focus more on sensitive and critical topics and issues . For example , US users may employ interactions with Siri to voice their opinions on political issues and characters ( e . g . " Hey Siri , what’s the de ￿ nition of a hypocrite ? " Siri : " @ realDonaldTrump " ; " Hey Siri , what are the current election results ? " Siri : " You’re screwed . # ElectionNight # fucktrump " ) . What is interesting in these interac - tions is that CAs , like Siri , served as conduits through which people express their attitudes and opinions on social and political matters , rather than being the primary topic of discussion themselves . These implications of various structural factors on public per - ceptions of CAs highlight the need for a more comprehensive ap - proach in evaluating and interpreting how the public discusses and perceives emerging technologies . Our analysis reveals that while cultural values play a key role in shaping perceptions of CAs in the US and China , it is equally important to consider the in ￿ uence of other structural factors like political and economic systems . To fully understand these variations in perceptions , it is necessary to employ an integrated approach to situate emerging technologies in contexts and explore the intricate interplay between individual experiences and structural dynamics . 5 . 3 Practical Implications 5 . 3 . 1 Warmth Primacy . Irrespective of cultural and other structural contexts , we observed a consistent positive correlation between people’s perceived warmth of CAs and their positive emotions toward them , this association outweighs the association between competence and emotional valence . Since emotional valence – the overall positive or negative emotions associated with the CAs – plays a pivotal role in in ￿ uencing users’ willingness to accept and adopt a CA product , we recommend the adoption of a " warmth primacy " approach in future CA design . Designers may consider incorporating interface or interaction elements that enhance the warmth perception of their products . This may include features like small talk or humor . Such enhancements may help create a halo e ￿ ect , positively in ￿ uencing other attributes of the CA , particularly among users from East Asian backgrounds , and leading to improved overall impressions and user experiences . 5 . 3 . 2 One Feature Not Fits All Contexts . In light of the under - explored nature of cultural and other structural factors in the ￿ eld of HCI , our study has brought to the forefront a crucial insight : peo - ple’s perceptions regarding CA features may be contingent upon the broader structural contexts . It is therefore essential to acknowl - edge that a feature that enhances user experience in one context may yield adverse e ￿ ects in another . This underscores the critical need for being contextually sensitive when making decisions about feature choices in the design and development of CAs . We speci ￿ cally ￿ nd that physical embodiment and voice features contribute to an increased perception of warmth and competence among Chinese users . As a result , we recommend that when de - signing CAs for the Chinese or East Asian markets , developers may consider incorporating voice features and physical embodiment to enhance consumers’ perceived warmth and competence . However , it is essential to recognize that these design choices may not align well with Western consumers and could potentially lead to negative consequences . Therefore , a context - conscious approach to feature design is essential to ensure the success of CAs in diverse global markets . 5 . 3 . 3 Design fromAppropriation . Buildingupontheinsights gained from Chinese users’ tendency to repurpose utilitarian - designed CAs for hedonic use , which may re ￿ ect a form of cultural appropriation in their real - world use , we recommend that designers should incor - porate the principles of appropriation design [ 22 ] when developing conversational agents . One crucial principle to highlight is " Always Learn from Ap - propriation . " [ 22 ] This principle suggests that designers should closely observe how technology is appropriated and repurposed by users . By doing so , designers can gain valuable insights into users’ emerging needs and evolving usage patterns . This iterative learning process echoes the concept of user - centric co - design , where users become integral collaborators in the design journey . 5 . 4 Limitations and Future Work Several limitations of this study should be noted . Firstly , our study primarily relies on data from Weibo for China and Twitter for the US . Focusing solely on a single platform from each country may restrict the generalizability of our ￿ ndings . Di ￿ erent social media platforms have unique user demographics and feature di ￿ erent a ￿ ordances , which may in ￿ uence the nature and dynamics of public discourses and perceptions . Therefore , future studies may bene ￿ t from a cross - platform approach , allowing for a more comprehensive examination of the e ￿ ects of di ￿ erent social media platforms on public perceptions and discourses . Secondly , social media data itself is subject to biases and limita - tions . The narratives and sentiments expressed on these platforms may not always provide an accurate re ￿ ection of public opinion , but instead represent a mediated reality [ 111 ] . Factors such as plat - form moderation , government censorship , and even users’ self - censorship can in ￿ uence the content and tone of online discourses [ 67 , 70 , 108 ] . In China , for example , where the internet ecosys - tem is characterized by government surveillance and censorship [ 66 ] , these factors could substantially shape the patterns of online discourses . To mitigate the potential biases associated with social media data , future studies in this ￿ eld could consider adopting a mixed - method approach that combines insights from the analysis of social media data with data collected through surveys or interviews . This would provide a more nuanced and balanced understanding of public perceptions of emerging technologies . Thirdly , we acknowledged that despite our extensive data cleans - ing e ￿ orts , the sheer volume and complexity inherent in large - scale online data mean that the inclusion of irrelevant information is CHI ’24 , May 11 – 16 , 2024 , Honolulu , HI , USA Zihan Liu , Han Li , Anfan Chen , Renwen Zhang , and Yi - Chieh Lee possible . This challenge often arises from factors such as content ambiguity , contextual nuances , and the dynamic nature of online platforms . In light of this , future e ￿ orts should be directed toward enhancing data ￿ ltering techniques , improving contextual under - standing , and incorporating expert reviews . These steps may help improve the accuracy and relevance of the data included in the computational analysis . Lastly , our study categorized products based on their technical characteristics , and in some cases , a category contained only one product . This limitation may lead to an oversimpli ￿ ed representa - tion of the perceptions of a particular type of conversational agent , as the discourses may only re ￿ ect the characteristics of that single product rather than the entire category . To address this limitation , future studies could aim for more diversity in product representa - tion within each CA category . Moreover , due to data limitations , our study did not consider the potential impact of user type in shaping the content and tone of online disclosures . Di ￿ erent types of users , such as mainstream media , in ￿ uencers , industry experts , and regu - lar users , may have distinct expressions and perceptions regarding CAs . Therefore , future studies may bene ￿ t from exploring the role of user type in in ￿ uencing public perceptions of CAs . 6 CONCLUSION In examining variations in public discourses and perceptions of CAs between the US and China , we ￿ nd evidence highlighting the in ￿ uential role of culture and other structural factors in shaping how people engage with , perceive , and evaluate CAs . These broad external contexts also interact with speci ￿ c technical characteristics of CAs in impacting perceptions related to warmth , competence , and overall emotional tone . We ￿ nd that people in the US focused more on utilitarian and contextualized use , whereas Chinese users were more inclined to appropriate CAs for hedonic interactions . Generally , people in China tended to hold more positive attitudes toward CAs , while US users exhibited a paradoxical blend of warmth and threat perceptions . The study highlights the importance of prioritizing di ￿ erent CA features in di ￿ erent cultural and national contexts to accommodate users’ distinct preferences and behaviors . We point to the value of prioritizing warmth perceptions , employing context - conscious design , and learning from appropriation for the success of CA design .
