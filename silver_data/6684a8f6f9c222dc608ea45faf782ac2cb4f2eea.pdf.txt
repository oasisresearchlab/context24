This second 3 social contact survey aimed to enable , for the ﬁrst time , the estimation of social mixing patterns for an 4 age range of 0 to 99 years and the investigation of whether contact rates remain stable over this 5 - year 5 time period . 6 Methods : Diﬀerent data mining techniques are used to explore the data , and the age - speciﬁc number 7 of social contacts and the age - speciﬁc contact rates are modelled using a GAMLSS model . We compare 8 diﬀerent matrices using assortativeness measures . The relative change in the basic reproduction number 9 ( R 0 ) and the ratio of relative incidences with 95 % bootstrap conﬁdence intervals ( BCI ) are employed to 10 investigate and quantify the impact on epidemic spread due to diﬀerences in gender , day of the week , 11 holiday vs . regular periods and changes in mixing patterns over the 5 - year time gap between the 2006 and 12 2010 - 2011 surveys . Finally , we compare the ﬁt of the contact matrices in 2006 and 2010 - 2011 to Varicella 13 serological data . 14 Results : All estimated contact patterns featured strong homophily in age and gender , especially for small 15 children and adolescents . A 30 % ( 95 % BCI [ 17 % ; 37 % ] ) and 29 % ( 95 % BCI [ 14 % ; 40 % ] ) reduction in 16 R 0 was observed for weekend versus weekdays and for holiday versus regular periods , respectively . Signiﬁ - 17 cantly more interactions between people aged 60 + years and their grandchildren were observed on holiday 18 and weekend days than on regular weekdays . Comparing contact patterns using diﬀerent methods did not 19 show any substantial diﬀerences over the 5 - year time period under study . 20 Conclusions : The second social contact survey in Flanders , Belgium , endorses the ﬁndings of its 2006 21 predecessor and adds important information on the social mixing patterns of people older than 60 years 22 of age . Based on this analysis , the mixing patterns of people older than 60 years exhibit considerable het - 23 erogeneity , and overall , the comparison of the two surveys shows that social contact rates can be assumed 24 stable in Flanders over a time span of 5 years . 25 Keywords : contact rates , contact behaviour , mixing patterns , behavioural changes , infectious diseases . 26 1 .

In recent years , we have witnessed a paradigm shift with respect to this : 30 whereas at the start of this century , mathematical models relied on simplifying assumptions such as homoge - 31 neous mixing or on using mathematically convenient “Who Acquires Infection From Whom” constructs [ 1 ] , a 32 vast number of studies now rely on the use of social contact data [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] . 33 The literature on social contact surveys has shown how human interactions are heterogeneous in nature and 34 present a large degree of homophily in terms of age [ 9 , 10 ] and gender [ 11 ] . The information coming from 35 social contact surveys is therefore usually summarized in what is called the social contact matrix , quantifying 36 the average number of contacts made between individuals within and between given age classes . Using the so - 37 cial contact hypothesis [ 2 ] , i . e . assuming that transmission rates are proportional to social contact rates , these 38 data - driven mixing patterns have been implemented into models of infectious disease transmission showing 39 good correspondence to ( sero ) prevalence data ; see , e . g . , [ 4 , 9 , 12 ] . 40 Social contact survey data allow for an exploration of contact rate patterns stratiﬁed by age , gender , and loca - 41 tion , which helps to better describe the structure of the transmission network [ 13 , 14 ] . However , a systematic 42 review by Hoang et al . ( 2019 ) [ 10 ] showed that half of the social contact surveys before 2019 used convenience 43 sampling , while quite a few surveys were conducted in speciﬁc settings , e . g . , schools or universities , and / or 44 focus on speciﬁc target groups ; thus , it is impossible to extrapolate the results to an entire population . Even 45 in population - based social contact surveys with representative samples , two problems might still exist : the 46 sample does not cover all age ranges of the population , or the number of elderly participants is insuﬃcient for 47 investigating mixing patterns of these people . Indeed , no study reported the contact rates of people up to 99 48 years old . 49 Particular attention has been devoted to behavioural changes with respect to individual health status ( e . g . , 50 being ill [ 6 , 15 , 16 , 17 ] ) , weather conditions [ 5 ] or day of the week ( weekday or weekend in holiday / non - holiday 51 or regular periods [ 9 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ] ) - hereafter referred to as microscopic time settings , and how these 52 aﬀect disease dynamics [ 6 , 8 , 19 , 23 , 24 ] . 53 The use of social contact data to inform modelling has become so prominent in recent works that it has also 54 been applied to settings for which social contact studies are not available , leading to the question of how social 55 contact matrices should be projected onto other geographical areas and in time [ 7 , 25 , 26 , 27 ] . However , to the 56 best of our knowledge , there has been no empirical assessment of whether mixing patterns change over longer 57 time periods ( e . g . , years ) within a particular population and how this should be taken into account when 58 projecting social contact matrices . We will refer to these as macroscopic time changes to mark the diﬀerence 59 with microscopic time changes . 60 A ﬁrst population - based social contact survey in Belgium was conducted in 2006 , and its results were reported 61 in [ 9 , 19 , 28 ] , in which the impact of microscopic time changes on the contact mixing pattern was investigated , 62 although this study was not designed for doing so . A second population - based survey in Belgium was con - 63 ducted 5 years later in 2010 - 2011 . This survey was conceived as an improvement over the 2006 survey , with a 64 larger sample size covering a wider age range of participants and a better distribution of surveyed participants 65 over four diﬀerent time settings ( weekday / weekend days in regular / holiday periods ) . 66 2 .

We study both the 68 impact of microscopic and macroscopic time changes on contact patterns , and we assess whether the contact 69 rates remain stable over 5 years timespan . 70 Data 71 Social contact survey in 2006 : This survey was part of the POLYMOD project , in which social contact 72 surveys were conducted in 8 European countries in 2005 - 2006 [ 9 ] . In the social contact survey conducted 73 in Belgium in 2006 , a total of 750 participants were recruited by random digit dialing on land lines . The 74 survey sample covered all three regions in Belgium ; i . e . the Flemish , Walloon and Brussels - Capital regions , 75 with quota sampling by age , gender , and region , making it representative for the whole Belgian population . 76 Each participant was asked to ﬁll in a background questionnaire and a paper diary in which they record their 77 contacts over 2 days : one randomly assigned weekday and one randomly assigned weekend day . Two types 78 of contacts were deﬁned : ( 1 ) two - way conversations during which at least three words were spoken and ( 2 ) 79 contacts that involved skin - to - skin touching . Information recorded in the diary included the gender and the 80 exact age or presumed age interval of each contacted person over the entire day . Contact features included 81 frequency , location and duration . If participants established more than 20 professional contacts per day , then 82 they only had to provide an estimated number of professional contacts and the age interval ( s ) with whom 83 they interacted most . Contact information ( e . g . , contact age or contact duration ) was then imputed for such 84 contacts . More details can be found in [ 28 ] . We will refer to those contacts as additional professional contacts . 85 86 Social contact survey in 2010 - 2011 : This survey was conducted between September 2010 and February 87 2011 in the Flemish region in Belgium using an adapted version of the diaries used in the ﬁrst Belgian survey 88 in 2006 . Three diﬀerent types of diaries were designed to adapt to the age of participants : one for children 89 ( less than 13 years old ) , which was completed by a proxy , e . g . , parents or school teachers ; one for people aged 90 13 - 60 years and one for people aged 60 + years , which could also be ﬁlled out by a proxy . A total of 1 , 774 91 participants were recruited by random digit dialing on mobile phones and landlines , with quota sampling by 92 age , gender and geographical location . The contact deﬁnitions were the same as those used in the 2006 survey . 93 Participants were asked to complete a background survey and record their social contacts in a paper diary 94 during one randomly assigned day . Information on additional professional contacts was imputed the same way 95 as done for 2006 data . Compared with the 2006 survey , the 2010 - 2011 survey explored more features that 96 might inﬂuence the number of contacts recorded : the health conditions of participants , time use , distance 97 from home , animal ownership and touching . To date , the impact of animal ownership and touching on social 98 contacts has been investigated [ 29 ] , so has the impact of weather on social contacts [ 5 ] . Of particular focus 99 were people aged 60 years and above ; i . e . , participants up to 99 years of age were recruited , and information 100 about contact frequency with children and grandchildren and residence size for elderly people living in nurs - 101 ing / elderly homes was recorded . 102 103 The design of the 2010 - 2011 survey is similar to that of 2006 , with the diﬀerence being that in 2010 - 2011 , 104 participants reported information for only one day , whereas in 2006 , information was collected for two days . 105 3 .

In the 2010 - 2011 survey , 15 cases were removed since the diaries 109 were unreliable ( many answers left blank , incoherent answers , etc . ) . We also excluded 46 people living in an 110 elderly / nursing home and explored the contact patterns of these people separately ; in addition , 6 people aged 111 more than 90 years were removed to avoid problems related to data sparsity . As a result , the ﬁnal sample for 112 the analysis of the 2010 - 2011 survey is 1 , 707 participants . We deﬁned four microscopic time settings : regular 113 weekdays , regular weekends , holiday weekends , and holiday weekdays . Holiday periods include both public 114 holidays and weekends inside or adjacent to these holidays . More details on the number of participants by 115 age and microscopic time in both surveys can be found in SA1 Table S1 . The datasets of both surveys are 116 available online within the social contact data sharing initiative [ 30 ] and the SOCRATES platform [ 14 ] . 117 Methodology 118 We start with a descriptive analysis to explore the socio - demographic characteristics of survey participants and 119 features of their reported contacts for the contact survey in 2010 - 2011 . Subsequently , data mining techniques 120 are used to explore associations among variables of interest and contact proﬁles of survey participants . We 121 then investigate the factors associated with the number of contacts , diﬀerences in gender in mixing patterns 122 and the impact of holidays and weekends as a proxy for the impact of school closure on disease transmission . 123 We end with the comparison between the contact surveys from 2006 and 2010 - 2011 using diﬀerent measures . 124 Data mining techniques 125 We use two unsupervised learning methods : association rules and clustering . Association rules are used 126 to assess the possible associations pertaining to contact features , e . g . , type of contact ( close or non - close ) , 127 duration and frequency of contacts , . . . , using support , conﬁdence and lift values as measures of interestingness 128 [ 19 , 31 ] ( see SA2 for additional information ) . Rules are considered of interest only when the support value 129 exceeds 1 % , equivalent to at least 3142 contacts involved in constructing the rules . The threshold for the 130 conﬁdence is 70 % , and rules with greater lift indicate stronger association . In addition to association rules , we 131 investigate contact proﬁles using a clustering method . The contact proﬁles are deﬁned by ( 1 ) the number of 132 contacts per survey participant in six diﬀerent locations ( home , work , school , leisure , transport and other ) , ( 2 ) 133 characteristics of participants ( age and gender ) and ( 3 ) time indicators ( weekday / weekend and regular / holiday 134 period ) . Clustering is implemented using the daisy function in the R package “Cluster” [ 32 ] and using the 135 Gower distance , which allows for mixed types of variables . We visualize the clusters by projecting them into 136 a low - dimensional space using a dimension reduction technique known as the t - distributed stochastic neighbor 137 embedding [ 33 ] . Contacts reported at diﬀerent locations are attributed to just one location using the following 138 hierarchy : ( 1 ) contacts at home , ( 2 ) contacts at work , ( 3 ) contacts at school , ( 4 ) contacts during leisure time , 139 ( 5 ) contacts in other locations and ( 6 ) contacts in transportation . 140 4 .

We model the number of contacts using a weighted negative binomial regression model to account 144 for over - dispersion . Socio - demographic characteristics , the health status of participants and microscopic time 145 settings ( weekdays / weekends and regular / holiday period ) are included as possible determinants ( descriptive 146 statistics see SA1 ) . In addition , diary weights computed from age and household size are used to account 147 for under - / over - sampling over participant features [ 9 , 28 ] . We perform variable selection using a random 148 forest analysis [ 31 ] and the likelihood ratio test ( LRT ) . Interactions between age and microscopic time settings 149 are retained , as they are the two most signiﬁcant determinants of the number of contacts reported in the 150 literature [ 10 ] . 151 Estimating age - speciﬁc contact rates 152 We deﬁne the age - speciﬁc number of contacts y ijr as the number of contacts made by the r th participant in 153 age class i with people in age class j per day ( i , j = 1 , · · · , J ; r = 1 , · · · , n i ) , where J is the number of age 154 classes , and n i is the number of participants in age class i . 155 156 The age - speciﬁc number of contacts y ijr is assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution to account 157 for over - dispersion [ 9 ] . This distribution is deﬁned as y ijr | x ∼ NB ( m ij , κ ij ) for a vector of covariates x , 158 in our case the age of the participant x 1 i and the age of the contact x 2 j . The mean and variance of this 159 distribution are deﬁned as m ij and m ij + κ ij ∗ ( m 2 ij ) , respectively , where κ ij is the over - dispersion parameter . 160 To model the age - speciﬁc number of contacts , we apply generalized additive models for location , scale and 161 shape ( GAMLSS ) . This allows for modelling both the mean and variance ( over - dispersion ) parameters of the 162 negative binomial distribution over participants’ age x 1 i and contacts’ age x 2 j . We refer to SA3 and [ 34 ] for 163 details about the GAMLSS . When estimating the social contact matrix C , the reciprocal nature of making 164 contact needs to be taken into account , as m ij N i = m ji N j , where N i is the population size in age class i 165 ( obtained from demographic data ) [ 35 ] . Based on m ij and N i , the reciprocal contact rates c ij can be obtained 166 by c ij = ( m ij N i + m ji N j ) ( 2 N i N j ) . 167 For all quantities of interest , introduced in this and following subsections , we use a non - parametric bootstrap 168 of participants , to obtain 95 % percentile bootstrap conﬁdence intervals ( BCIs ) [ 36 ] . 169 Measures of comparison between diﬀerent mixing patterns 170 We use four diﬀerent measures of comparison : two for measuring assortativeness , the relative change in R 0 and 171 the relative incidence ( RI ) . We measure the assortativeness of contacts by age using 2 diﬀerent indices . The ﬁrst 172 index is Gupta’s Q [ 37 ] , which ranges from 0 ( = homogeneous mixing ) to 1 ( = completely assortative mixing ) . 173 The second index is I 2 s , as proposed in [ 38 ] ranging from 0 ( = perfect assortativity ) to 1 ( = homogeneous 174 mixing ) . 175 The third measure is based on the basic reproduction number R 0 . R 0 is given by the dominant eigenvalue 176 of the next generation matrix G . Assuming the age - speciﬁc transmission rates β ( i , j ) are proportional to 177 the age - speciﬁc social contact rates c ( i , j ) ( also known as the social contact hypothesis [ 2 ] ) , the ratio of 178 5 .

Lastly , the ratio of relative incidences ( RRI ) is used for comparison . The 180 expected age - speciﬁc RI in the population during the exponential phase is given by the leading right eigenvector 181 of the next - generation matrix [ 39 ] . 182 For more details , we refer to SA3 . 183 Investigating gender diﬀerences in mixing patterns 184 To gain insights into possibly diﬀerent mixing behaviour between males and females , we estimate the age - 185 speciﬁc average number of contacts using the GAMLSS approach ( as previously introduced ) for all four 186 combinations of gender interactions ( male - male , female - female , male - female and female - male ) . We use assor - 187 tativeness measures ( I 2 s and Q indices ) , and the RRI to study diﬀerences between matrices . 188 Investigating the impact of school closure on disease transmission 189 We estimate the impact of school closure based on social contact data using contact rates from holidays and 190 weekend days as a proxy and compare them with contact rates from regular weekdays . We use the changes in 191 R 0 and the RRI to quantify these diﬀerences . 192 Comparing the contact surveys in 2006 and 2010 - 2011 193 The designs of the contact surveys in 2006 and 2010 - 2011 are similar ( see Section Data ) . However , the 2006 194 survey did not cover age groups up until 90 years of age or suﬃciently cover all four microscopic time settings 195 ( see SA1 Table S1 ) . Therefore , for the comparison of contact matrices between 2006 and 2010 - 2011 , we only 196 use participants less than 65 years old and merged weekend - regular and weekend - holiday into one “weekend” 197 category to overcome the data sparsity problem . 198 Degree distribution of contacts from aggregated data 199 To investigate potential determinants for the number of contacts , we combine data from 2006 and 2010 - 2011 200 using a survey indicator variable as an additional determinant . We ﬁrst apply a random forest analysis [ 31 ] 201 to identify main predictors , after which we model the aggregated number of contacts via a GAMLSS model 202 assuming a negative binomial distribution for the response variable . Model selection is performed using the 203 likelihood ratio test for mean and dispersion parameters . 204 Comparing contact matrices 205 We ﬁrst visually compare contact matrices in 2006 and 2010 - 2011 for the diﬀerent microscopic time settings . 206 Both assortativeness indices , the change in R 0 and the RRI are used to compare mixing patterns . Furthermore , 207 we use the ratio of transmission rates that allows for the direct comparison of contact rates between contact 208 matrices ( a cell - wise comparison ) . Lastly , we applied the methods outlined in [ 4 ] to use social contact matrices 209 to ﬁt VZV serological data from Belgium based on the social contact hypothesis ( i . e . , constant proportionality , 210 [ 2 ] ) , with both contact data sets separately and compare the results . 211 6 .

The average participant age was 38 years , and participants younger than 18 years of age accounted 217 for 22 % of the sample . The average household size was 3 , ranging from 1 to 11 ; participants with household 218 sizes of 2 - 4 accounted for nearly 75 % of the sample size , while only 13 % of participants lived in households 219 with more than 4 residents . Approximately 21 % of the participants were still students , 48 % had a job , 13 % 220 were retired and approximately 11 % were at home or unemployed . Nearly two - thirds of working participants 221 were oﬃce clerks , 19 % were manual workers , and only 6 % were self - employed . 222 Daily number of contacts and contact features 223 A total of 31 , 423 contacts including 8 , 527 imputed professional contacts were recorded by the 1 , 707 partici - 224 pants : the highest number of contacts reported by one participant was 364 ( mostly professional contacts ) , and 225 the lowest was zero ( 15 cases ) . The median number of reported contacts were 12 ( interquartile range ( IQR ) : [ 6 ; 226 21 ] ) . Participants reported an average of 18 . 4 contacts per day ( SD = 24 . 3 ) , skewed in distribution . This re - 227 duces to 13 . 4 ( SD = 10 . 8 ) when professional contacts are excluded . By adjusting for the age and household size 228 of the Flemish population and type of day ( weekdays / weekend days ) , the average number of contacts equals 229 17 . 2 ( 12 . 0 when excluding professional contacts ) . 230 Nearly half the number of contacts involved touching ( with missing information in 345 cases ) . More than 231 10 % of all contacts were with household members . Daily contacts accounted for nearly one - third of the total 232 number of contacts , while only 10 % were ﬁrst - time contacts . Short contacts ( less than 5 minutes ) made up 233 approximately 15 % of the total number of contacts ; long contacts ( longer than 1 hour ) constituted nearly half 234 of the total number of contacts . Nearly two - thirds of all reported contacts were made at home , work and 235 school , while contacts at multiple locations accounted for only 6 % of all contacts . 236 Data mining techniques 237 The association rules with the highest lift value are presented in Table S1 in SA2 . Seventy - four percent of 238 daily contacts lasting longer than 4 hours involved skin - to - skin touching . In contrast , 81 % of the contacts 239 lasting less than 5 minutes with non - household members were usually non - physical contacts . Contacts with 240 household members are the most inﬂuential factor in determining whether contacts occur on a daily basis . 241 Contacts lasting longer than 4 hours , occurring on weekdays in a regular period , tend to occur on a daily basis 242 ( 71 % ) . 243 In the clustering analysis , the largest silhouette width is obtained for six clusters ( Figure S1 in SA2 ) . The 244 cluster sizes ranged from 151 participants ( cluster 5 ) to 443 participants ( cluster 1 ) . All clusters present a 245 strong connection with the microscopic time settings , including participants from only weekdays / weekends or 246 regular days / holidays ( Table S2 in SA2 ) . Some clusters are easy to interpret when looking at the cluster 247 members’ features . Cluster 2 , for example , is composed of participants whose average age is 9 years , with a 248 7 .

Cluster 4 includes participants with an average 249 age of 39 years and a large number of contacts at work , i . e . , working - age adults . Other clusters present less 250 speciﬁc contact patterns but still exhibit a strong connection with microscopic time settings . Speciﬁcally , 251 cluster 1 includes participants who have a low number of contacts in all locations on regular weekdays . 252 Participants in this cluster have the highest average age ( 51 years ) and can be interpreted as being socially 253 non - active . Cluster 3 includes participants surveyed on the weekend and regular period , with few contacts at 254 work and school but the highest number of contacts during leisure activities and at “other” locations . Cluster 5 255 contains participants surveyed in the weekend and holiday period , with no contacts at school , few contacts 256 at work and most contacts at home and in “other” locations . Cluster 6 consists of participants surveyed in 257 the weekday and holiday period , with an average of 6 contacts at work , a very low number of contacts during 258 leisure activities and transportation ( see SA2 Table S2 and Figure S2 ) . 259 Degree distribution for the social contact survey in 2010 - 2011 260 Figure 1 shows the results of the weighted negative binomial model for the number of contacts . Several socio - 261 demographic indicators have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the number of contacts : age , household size , place of living 262 and the use of public transportation . It is noted that occupation and education have been excluded from 263 the model , as they strongly correlate with age , and that for participants younger than 13 years , the mother’s 264 educational level is used instead of that of the participant . Other variables ( gender , animal ownership , health 265 states regarding self - care and pain ) were also excluded after model selection was performed ( see Table S1 and 266 Figure S1 ) . The interactions between age and microscopic time indicators are highly signiﬁcant . In Figure 1 , 267 we compare the number of contacts among age groups in each time setting : for weekdays in the regular period , 268 participants older than 5 years of age have a higher number of contacts than children aged 0 – 5 years , except 269 the 15 – 25 age group , and people older than 60 years who have the lowest number of contacts . For holiday 270 weekdays , people between 40 and 50 years of age have the highest number of contacts , while other age groups 271 show no diﬀerence in the number of contacts relative to the youngest age group ( 0 – 5 years ) . The number of 272 contacts of children aged 0 – 5 decreases by 25 % , 46 % and 54 % with respect to regular weekdays during holiday 273 weekdays , regular weekends and holiday weekends , respectively . During regular periods , people aged 75 – 90 274 have almost double the contacts during weekends with respect to weekdays . A higher number of contacts is 275 observed in participants living in larger households and those using public transportation . The number of 276 contacts is 41 % lower in those who felt ill on the survey day . The reported health indicators show that feeling 277 anxiety and having problems in carrying out daily activities have a negative eﬀect on the number of contacts , 278 reducing them by 18 % and 35 % , respectively . 279 Contacts of children , working people and elderly people 280 Some variables were only present in diaries for children ( less than 13 years old ) , adults or people older than 281 60 years of age , so these variables were not included in the previous model ( Figure 1 ) . Children attending 282 preschools or schools have more contacts than children at childcare outside home and young children who are 283 kept at home ( P < 0 . 001 , Kruskal - Wallis test ) . It is also observed that there is no diﬀerence in the number of 284 school contacts among diﬀerent class sizes ( P = 0 . 40 , Kruskal - Wallis test ) . Children less than 3 years old have 285 nearly 40 % of their contacts at home . School contacts make up 44 % of the number of contacts for participants 286 8 .

People 287 with a job have a much higher number of contacts than those who are retired or currently unemployed / job 288 seeking . Working people have most contacts at work ( 63 % on a random day and 71 % on regular weekdays ) . 289 When considering occupation , the number of contacts of oﬃce clerks is observed to be signiﬁcant higher than 290 those of people with other occupations . 291 Modelling the number of contacts for participants older than 60 years who are not living in an elderly / nursing 292 home ( SA3 Table S2 ) shows that drinking status has no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the number of contacts and neither 293 does having children or grandchildren . Smokers have fewer contacts than those who are non - smokers or used 294 to smoke . Elderly people who experience problems in performing their daily activities have fewer contacts 295 than those who do not experience problems ( relative number of contacts ( RNC ) : 0 . 64 ; 95 % CI [ 0 . 49 ; 0 . 84 ] ) . 296 The eﬀect of microscopic time settings is signiﬁcant : more contacts were observed in weekend - regular periods 297 than in weekday - regular periods . The majority of elderly people who have children and / or grandchildren 298 reported having contacts with their children and grandchildren a few times per week or month . Figure 2 299 describes the social interaction of people aged 60 + years with other age groups . People aged 61 – 79 years have 300 the highest number of contacts with age group [ 40 , 60 ) , which may describe the mixing pattern of people from 301 2 generations . Interaction between people aged 60 + years and young children / teenagers is signiﬁcantly higher 302 on holiday - weekdays and weekend days than on regular - weekdays . 303 People living in an elderly / nursing home 304 Forty - six people reported living in a nursing / elderly home , with ages ranging from 79 to 99 years . Most of 305 them have health problems : some problems or not being able to perform their daily activities ( 96 % ) , some 306 problems walking ( 67 % ) or staying in bed all the time ( 15 % ) ; some problems with self - care ( 46 % ) or not 307 being able to care for themselves ( 43 % ) ; and experiencing mild to serious pain ( 85 % ) and anxiety ( 48 % ) . 308 These people reported 13 . 7 contacts on average , signiﬁcantly higher than those aged 60 + years and living at 309 home ( P < 0 . 0 . 001 , Mann - Whitney test ) . No statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the number of contacts for 310 people in elderly / nursing homes was found with respect to the residence size ( P = 0 . 47 , Kruskal - Wallis test for 311 3 groups of residence sizes : < 50 , 50 – 100 and 100 + ) . We compared people living in an elderly / nursing home 312 with people aged 60 + years living at home with respect to their social interaction with other age groups ( see 313 SA3 Figure S2 ) : almost no interaction with young children and teenagers is observed for people living in an 314 elderly / nursing home , while this interaction is more observed for people aged 60 + years living at home . 315 Overall contact patterns 316 The contact patterns by age group were summarized in a contact matrix displaying ages from 0 to 90 years , 317 whose elements represent the contact rate between an individual in a given age group and an individual in 318 another age group in the Flemish population . The resulting contact matrix shown in Figure 3 is described by 319 the pronounced main diagonal indicating contacts with individuals in the same age group , e . g . , at home , at 320 school and at work , and the 2 less - pronounced sub - diagonals representing contacts between generations , e . g . , 321 children and their parents . 322 9 .

The assortative mixing pattern 324 characterized by the main diagonal is still observed for all interactions . The measures of assortativeness for all 325 ages provide no diﬀerences for same gender vs . diﬀerent genders , with overlapping 95 % BCI of I 2 s indices ( 0 . 39 326 [ 0 . 35 ; 0 . 45 ] and 0 . 42 [ 0 . 40 ; 0 . 45 ] vs 0 . 48 [ 0 . 43 ; 0 . 54 ] and 0 . 44 [ 0 . 42 ; 0 . 47 ] , for male - male and female - female vs . 327 male - female and female - male , respectively ) . Focusing on people aged less than 30 years , we noticed that the 328 assortative mixing pattern is more pronounced in male - to - male and female - to - female contacts . Speciﬁcally , 329 for contacts made between people in the same age groups , the average number of male - to - male contacts and 330 female - to - female contacts are 3 . 9 ( BCI [ 3 . 5 ; 5 . 0 ] ) and 4 . 2 ( BCI [ 3 . 7 ; 4 . 9 ] ) , respectively . These ﬁgures were 331 reduced to 2 . 3 ( BCI [ 2 . 0 ; 2 . 8 ] ) for male - to - female contacts and 2 . 6 ( BCI [ 2 . 3 ; 3 . 1 ] ) for female - to - male contacts . 332 The inter - generational mixing pattern ( mostly parent - child ) , marked by the two sub - diagonals , is similar for 333 females and males . The relative incidences for both genders also follow a similar pattern , with peaks at 334 approximately 15 years of age and between 40 and 45 years of age , and no diﬀerence is found in the overall 335 RI of males compared to that of females ( see Figure S3 in SA3 ) . 336 School closure impact 337 We observed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in R 0 between holiday and regular periods : the relative change in R 0 338 equals 0 . 71 ( BCI [ 0 . 60 ; 0 . 85 ] ) , or equivalently a 29 % reduction in R 0 for the holiday vs . the regular period . 339 When comparing the relative change in R 0 from a weekday to the weekend , a slightly higher reduction of 340 30 % was observed . The diﬀerence in RI by age group is shown in Figure 5 . The comparison of weekdays to 341 weekends shows that the RI decreases signiﬁcantly in the age group 0 – 15 years , while it is higher in the age 342 group [ 60 , 65 ) and [ 70 , 75 ) on the weekend compared with the weekday . The RI also decreases from regular to 343 holiday periods for the 3 age groups from 5 to 20 years , with the highest reduction observed in the age group 344 10 – 15 years . When comparing regular to holiday periods , we observe an increase in the RI for participants 345 aged 65 to 80 years , though the RI variability for this age group is considerably high . 346 Comparing the contact surveys in 2006 and 2010 - 2011 347 The age distribution of the Flemish population by age group does not change much in almost 5 years ( SA3 Fig - 348 ure S4a ) . The distribution of participants in the survey 2010 - 2011 is closer to the Flemish population than 349 that in the 2006 survey , especially for people older than 60 years . Participants aged between 0 – 20 years are 350 over - sampled , while age groups 30 – 45 and 65 – 85 are under - sampled in the 2006 survey . The average number 351 of contacts by age , adjusted for age , household size and types of days ( weekdays / weekend days ) , in the two 352 surveys is presented in SA3 Figure S4b . The largest diﬀerence in the number of survey participants is found 353 for the age group 70 – 75 . 354 Degree distribution from aggregated data 355 The result of the random forest analysis is shown in Figure S5 SA3 : gender yields the lowest mean decrease 356 in accuracy , so it is removed . Signiﬁcant predictors for both mean and over - dispersion parameters are further 357 selected using the likelihood ratio test . Accordingly , the mean and over - dispersion regressions in the ﬁnal 358 10 .

After controlling for other factors , the household size is still signiﬁcant , 362 with a higher number of contacts recorded by participants living in a larger household . On regular weekdays , 363 participants aged 60 + years reported the lowest number of contacts in both the 2006 and 2010 - 2011 surveys . 364 During the same period , participants aged 45 – 50 years had the highest number of contacts in the 2006 365 survey , while participants aged 30 – 35 years had the highest number of contacts in the 2010 - 2011 survey . We 366 observed a signiﬁcant eﬀect of microscopic time settings : in particular , participants aged 0 – 5 years reported 367 a signiﬁcantly lower number of contacts during weekends than regular weekdays , with RNC being 0 . 33 ( CI 368 [ 0 . 24 ; 0 . 45 ] ) for the 2006 survey , while no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the number of contacts between during the 369 regular weekday and the holiday weekdays was found for this age group . The main eﬀect of macroscopic time 370 ( calendar year ) and its interaction eﬀects with age group and microscopic time settings are signiﬁcant . On 371 regular weekdays , participants aged 0 – 5 years old in the 2010 - 2011 survey reported a lower number of contacts 372 than those in the 2006 survey : RNC is 0 . 64 ( CI [ 0 . 46 ; 0 . 89 ] ) . 373 Comparing the contact matrices for 2006 and 2010 - 2011 374 The diﬀerence between contact matrices estimated from the 2006 and 2010 - 2011 social contact surveys is 375 negligible ( Figure 6 ) . Similar age and parent - child mixing patterns are observed for all contact matrices . The 376 degree of assortativeness measured by Q and I 2 indices ( Table 2 ) are comparable in each microscopic time 377 period , as evidenced by the overlapping BCIs . The relative incidences in 2006 and 2010 - 2011 ( SA3 Figure S6 ) 378 are also similar in both regular weekdays and holiday weekdays but are moderately dissimilar on the weekend , 379 as the highest relative incidence is found in two diﬀerent age classes ( 10 - 15 years and 20 - 25 years for 2006 and 380 2010 - 2011 , respectively ) . 381 The relative change in R 0 , RRI and the ratio of transmission rates are used to further compare the epidemio - 382 logical diﬀerences between contact matrices from the two surveys . The relative changes in R 0 are presented in 383 Figure 7 a ) . Based on the 95 % BCI of relative changes in R 0 , signiﬁcant changes between contact matrices of 384 2006 ( numerator ) and 2010 - 2011 ( denominator ) are only observed during the weekend , with an upper bound 385 of the BCI close to 1 . Figure 7 b ) presents the changes in relative incidence between the 2006 and 2010 - 2011 386 social contact matrices stratiﬁed over 13 age groups and 3 microscopic time settings . Similar to the results 387 of the relative change in R 0 , there was no evidence to support changes in RI over time , except for the age 388 group 10 - 15 years during the weekend , where the RI was signiﬁcantly higher in 2006 than in 2010 - 2011 . The 389 comparison of contact matrices based on the ratio of cell - wise contact rates in each microscopic time setting 390 is provided in SA3 Figures S7 , S8 and S9 , for which the BCIs included a correction for multiple testings . We 391 only found few signiﬁcant diﬀerences in contact rates during holiday weekdays between 2006 and 2010 - 2011 , 392 mostly for participants aged 50 + years . 393 394 We compared the ﬁt of the two contact matrices in 2006 and 2010 - 2011 to VZV serological data SA3 Fig - 395 ures S10 . Although the contact matrix in 2006 produces a slightly better ﬁt than the contact matrix in 396 2010 - 2011 ( AIC : 1379 vs 1383 ) , the observed prevalence and force of infection by age group between the 397 two surveys almost completely overlap . We found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in R 0 obtained from the contact 398 11 .

In Belgium , two large diary - based social contact surveys were conducted in 2006 402 and 2010 - 2011 . In this work , we present the results of the latest survey , discussing the impact of microscopic 403 time diﬀerences on mixing patterns and comparing the 2010 - 2011 data with the 2006 data . This approach 404 allowed for assessing changes over macroscopic time diﬀerences , albeit in the limiting scenario of two surveys 405 conducted only 4 - 5 years apart in a region where demography has remained fairly stable . 406 The association rules revealed that contacts of less than 15 minutes with non - household members usually do 407 not involve skin - to - skin touching . This ﬁnding is in line with the results of the 2006 survey [ 28 ] . To investigate 408 the contact proﬁles of participants , we performed clustering analysis . Our clustering results are comparable 409 to the results in [ 3 ] , in which a two - step clustering approach was applied to contact data from eight European 410 countries . Speciﬁcally , we endorsed the “school proﬁle” , “professional proﬁle” , and “leisure proﬁle” from [ 3 ] , 411 with more contacts during leisure activities during weekends . 412 Demographic factors , including age , household and province of residence , have signiﬁcant eﬀects on the num - 413 ber of contacts , as do the temporal factors , e . g . , weekdays vs weekend days or regular terms vs holiday periods 414 [ 9 , 10 , 16 , 22 , 40 ] . It is noted that the interaction between people aged 60 + years and young children / teenagers 415 is signiﬁcantly higher during holidays and weekends compared to regular - weekdays . For people living in an 416 elderly / nursing home , however , almost no contacts with young children / teenagers are reported . Using public 417 transportation is associated with a higher number of contacts in total . Our analysis also showed that those 418 who reported to feel ill had fewer contacts than those who reported to be healthy [ 6 , 10 , 15 , 16 , 17 ] . This 419 also holds for participants reporting health problems such as anxiety or those experiencing problems in daily 420 activities . 421 There is evidence , at least among school - aged children , that contact patterns are assortative with respect to 422 both age and gender . While an assortative mixing pattern with respect to age is still observed in adults , 423 albeit with lower contact rates , an assortative mixing pattern with respect to gender disappears in people 424 aged 30 + years . This analysis was also performed in [ 41 ] , where a hierarchical Bayesian model was used to 425 infer age - speciﬁc contact rates between genders . In contrast to [ 41 ] , we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences in 426 infection risk between males and females . There are some reasons that may explain this diﬀerence . First , 427 we aggregated the age of participants in 20 age classes instead of using continuous age , which can incur an 428 inevitable loss of detail . Second , the dispersion parameter in our model was assumed to be age - dependent , 429 while it was treated as a nuisance parameter in [ 41 ] to avoid computation challenges . In addition , we used 430 diary weights in contact modelling to account for under - / over - sampling over the age of participants , while 431 weights were not taken into account in the model of [ 41 ] . 432 We found that the number of contacts was lower on weekends than on weekdays and during holidays com - 433 pared to regular periods . We ﬁnd a 30 % ( BCI : [ 17 ; 37 % ) reduction in R 0 for weekends versus weekdays or a 434 29 % ( BCI : [ 14 ; 40 % ] ) reduction in R 0 for holidays versus regular periods . This result is consistent with the 435 results of other studies [ 8 , 19 , 40 , 42 , 43 ] . However , computing the age - speciﬁc relative incidence showed that 436 this reduction is due to the younger age classes , both during weekends and during holidays . Additionally , 437 12 .

Our result shows that irrespective of microscopic time settings , the contact patterns in 443 2006 and 2010 - 2011 follow the same trend of assortativeness . Furthermore , we observed pronounced inter - 444 generational age mixing ( the two sub - diagonals of the contact matrices ) , most likely indicating parent - child 445 mixing patterns . This ﬁnding supports the evidence that households are central units in the epidemiology 446 of airborne infections , e . g . , inﬂuenza and SARS , because of the nature of the frequent and intimate contacts 447 among household members . Children thus can have a bridging function , allowing for the spread of infection 448 within households and to other households , from schools to workplaces or vice versa in a community [ 44 ] . The 449 mixing patterns obtained from the contact matrices in 2006 and 2010 - 2011 in our study are in agreement with 450 mixing patterns observed in similar studies [ 9 , 10 ] . The relative incidences based on the 2006 and 2010 - 2011 451 data are quite similar between regular weekdays and holiday weekdays but are dissimilar on the weekend , as 452 the highest relative incidence is found in two diﬀerent age classes ( 10 - 15 years and 20 - 25 years for 2006 and 453 2010 - 2011 , respectively ) . 454 In this study , we found that contact patterns remained fairly constant over 4 - 5 years . Additionally , within 455 each microscopic time period , no substantial changes in the spread of infection , measured by the relative basic 456 reproduction number and age - speciﬁc incidences , were observed ( Figure 7 ) . After taking into account multiple 457 testings , the pair - wise comparison of contact rates over time present only few signiﬁcant diﬀerences during 458 holiday weekdays , mostly for people aged 50 + years . While the comparison of only two observational periods 459 about ﬁve years apart can be considered a limitation , to the best of our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst study , that 460 investigates empirically whether contact rates remain stable , in the absence of major shocks to risk perception 461 ( as we expect to observe in the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic emergence year 2020 ) and demography . Hence our 462 results suggest that stable social mixing patterns can be assumed over a time span of 5 years when no major 463 shocks to risk perceptions or demography occur . 464 465 Declarations 466 Availability of data and materials 467 The datasets analysed during the current study are available on Zenodo [ 45 , 46 ] . 468 Competing interests 469 The authors declare that they have no competing interests . 470 Author’s contributions 471 NH and PB designed and coordinated the survey .
