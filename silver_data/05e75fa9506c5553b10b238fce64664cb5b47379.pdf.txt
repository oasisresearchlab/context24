Connon 1 Whilst demonstrated extensively in vitro , the control of cell behaviour via modulation of substrate compliance in live tissues has not been accomplished to date . Here we propose that stem cells can be regulated solely through in situ modulation of tissue biomechanics . By ﬁ rst establishing , via high - resolution Brillouin spectro - microscopy , that the outer edge ( limbus ) of live human corneas has a substantially lower bulk modulus compared to their centre , we then demonstrate that this difference is associated with limbal epithelial stem cell ( LESC ) resi - dence and YAP - dependent mechanotransduction . This phenotype - through - biomechanics correlation is further explored in vivo using a rabbit alkali burn model . Speci ﬁ cally , we show that treating the burnt surface of the cornea with collagenase effectively restores the tissue ’ s mechanical properties and its capacity to support LESCs through mechanisms involving YAP suppression . Overall , these ﬁ ndings have extended implications for understanding stem cell niche biomechanics and its impact on tissue regeneration . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 09331 - 6 OPEN 1 Institute of Genetic Medicine , Newcastle University , International Centre for Life , Newcastle - upon - Tyne NE1 3BZ , UK . 2 The Blackett Laboratory , Imperial College London , London SW7 2BW , UK . 3 Harry S .

These limbal epithelial stem cells ( LESCs ) proliferate and differentiate to repopulate the central corneal epithelium , where cells constantly undergo maturation , strati ﬁ - cation , and ultimately , shedding from the ocular surface . These events have been shown to be modulated by biochemical and biophysical factors 2 , 3 . However , the mechanisms underpinning the homoeostatic process of LESC self - renewal and differentiation remain largely unclear 4 . This subject was further complicated by previous suggestions that the limbus is not the only epithelial stem cell niche in the cornea and that corneal renewal is not different from other squamous epithelia 5 , two concepts that have since been robustly refuted 2 , 4 , 6 . More recently , a number of stu - dies have shown that the behaviour of LESCs , like other stem cell types 7 , is strongly in ﬂ uenced by their immediate mechanical environment . This notion is supported by the cellular stiffness of LESCs 8 , as well as by the distinct structure 9 , composition 10 , and compliance 11 of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) across the cornea . In particular , the impact of substrate stiffness on corneal epi - thelial cell attachment and viability 12 , proliferation 13 , and mechanosensing 14 has been explored in vitro , using biomimetic surfaces with elastic moduli de ﬁ ned after corneal biomechanics , as determined by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) 15 . These stu - dies showed that corneal epithelial cells grown on relatively soft substrates are able to retain limbal markers whereas cells cultured on corresponding stiff substrates are disposed to differ - entiate 13 , 14 , 16 . This body of work suggests that , at least in vitro , substrate rigidity regulates LESC phenotype via mechan - otransduction pathways involving the yes - associated protein ( YAP ) transcription factor 14 , and possibly other molecular signals ( e . g . , FAK / RHOA , ERK1 / 2 , MAL , lamin A / C , and β - catenin ) 17 . Yet , the role and relevance of tissue biomechanics on the beha - viour of LESCs in vivo is still a matter of contention , in part due to the dif ﬁ culty in characterising the cells ’ native mechanical environment with accuracy and detail on intact tissues . The inability to perform such characterisation is a major restriction to the development of new mechanical therapies ( i . e . , by creating better synthetic niches or in vivo stem cell manipulation to promote tissue regeneration ) 17 , 18 . We thus set about a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that substrate stiffness within the native limbal stem cell niche is relevant to stem cell phenotype and wound healing , both in vivo and ex vivo . We start by using Brillouin spectro - microscopy ( BSM ) , a technique based on the interaction of light with spon - taneous acoustic phonons in the GHz frequency range , to char - acterise the mechanical properties of live human corneas in a true non - contact , penetrating ( three - dimensional ) , non - destructive mode ( unlike atomic force microscopy , rheology , elastography , or tensile testing methods ) . Previously , BSM has been used to evaluate mechanical properties of cells and tissues both in vivo 19 and in vitro 20 , 21 , including in the cornea at relatively low reso - lutions 22 , 23 . Our BSM setup is designed with an original wave - front division adaptive interferometer and a piezoelectric actuator 22 to extinguish the elastically scattered light , thus allowing the organ - wide , in - depth scanning of whole human corneas at very high resolution and within a time frame com - patible with live imaging . Therefore , we use the accuracy of this method to identify critical biomechanical differences between the ( softer ) limbus and the ( stiffer ) central cornea , and establish a correlation between tissue biomechanics and corneal epithelial cell phenotype . This data thus supports our hypothesis that epi - thelial cell differentiation across the corneal surface is controlled by changes in substrate stiffness , via the activation of YAP - dependent mechanotransduction pathways . But more importantly , these results suggest the basis for a pharmacological method to control the phenotype of corneal epithelial cells both in vivo and ex vivo , via the modulation of tissue biomechanics . Speci ﬁ cally , we show that LESC - like phenotype can be promoted in healthy and wounded corneas ( for improved wound healing ) through the application of a collagenase enzyme , using a for - mulation currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration , European Medicines Agency , and Health Canada for connective tissue softening 24 – 26 and already employed ther - apeutically for treating glaucoma 27 . In this perspective , our study demonstrates the concept of phenotype - through - biomechanical modulation in vivo , a concept that opens new possibilities for creating better cell therapies and medical devices for tissue regeneration . Results BSM shows transition between softer limbus and stiffer central anterior cornea . The BSM setup used in this study allowed the whole - organ imaging of immersed human corneas ( Fig . 1 ) to be performed through the entire 12 mm - span and 3 mm - depth of the cornea , at high resolution ( Fig . 1b ) , speed ( 0 . 01 – 1 s per measurement ) , and accuracy ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . This approach facilitated the identi ﬁ cation of numerous crucial bio - mechanical features . Firstly , it showed that the limbus had , overall , lower Brillouin frequency shift values , indicating it was more compliant than the central cornea ( Fig . 1b ) . Secondly , it identi ﬁ ed the highest frequency shifts ( i . e . , stiffest tissue ) in a discontinuous , 10 – 15 µm - thick sub - epithelial layer of the central cornea ( Fig . 1c ) , probably corresponding to the Bowman ’ s layer 11 . Finally , it showed that this layer of stiff matrix was absent in the limbus ( Fig . 1d ) . The substantial differences in Brillouin fre - quency shift between the anterior region of the central cornea and the limbus prompted a quantitative evaluation of these regions ( Fig . 1e ) . Brillouin transversal section scans in the central cornea showed a multi - layered epithelium ~ 50 µm thick ( Fig . 1c ) with average ± S . D . frequency shift of 6 . 37 ± 0 . 09 GHz ( Fig . 1e ) and basal columnar cells presenting stiff nuclei , as previously pre - dicted 14 , followed by a 10 – 15 µm - thick Bowman ’ s layer and the anterior - most stroma with 6 . 66 ± 0 . 04 and 6 . 53 ± 0 . 04 GHz shifts , respectively ( Fig . 1e ) . In contrast , the limbal epithelium ranging 40 – 60 µm depth ( Fig . 1d ) and 6 . 34 ± 0 . 14 GHz was followed by matrix with signi ﬁ cantly lower frequency shift ( 6 . 24 ± 0 . 09 GHz ) , which in turn was followed by tissue exhibiting slightly higher shifts ( 6 . 40 ± 0 . 14 GHz , respectively ; Fig . 1e ) , probably corre - sponding to the continuation of the corneal stroma under the limbus ( Fig . 1b ) 28 . Consistently , the distinction in frequency shifts between epithelium and the sub - epithelial matrix immediately underneath was less clear in the limbus than in the central cornea ( Fig . 1c and d ) . The limbus also showed a broader distribution range of Brillouin frequency shift values in all its layers , whereas the central corneal was characterised by uniform biomechanical properties within each layer ( Fig . 1e ) , with a pro ﬁ le consistent to that from previous studies 23 . The clear distinction between the mechanically heterogeneous limbus and the more regular central cornea was more evident in very high - resolution scans ( Supple - mentary Figs . 1 and 2 ) and under alternative vantage points ( Supplementary Movies 1 and 2 ) , and consistently observed in all corneas analysed , irrespectively of donors ’ gender , or age . This distribution pattern was probably due to the furrowed topography of the limbus , and the presence of numerous structures , such as the Palisades of Vogt , focal stromal projections , and limbal crypts and / or pits ( Supplementary Movie 1 ) , particularly abundant in the superior and inferior limbus but less so in the temporal and nasal side of the cornea 2 , 29 – 31 ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) .

Three - dimensional Brillouin scans showed that these pockets comprise multiple spherical units 10 – 12 µm in diameter ( Supplementary Movie 2 ) that are compatible , dimension 32 , and biomechanical - wise 8 , with LESCs surrounded by stiffer cells and matrix . BSM and immuno ﬂ uorescence shows LESCs residing on soft limbal matrix . Importantly , these limbal pockets identi ﬁ ed by BSM also represented the location of cells co - expressing ABCG2 , CK15 , nuclear β - catenin , and Δ Np63 ( Fig . 2a – c ; Supplementary Fig . 3b ) , markers consensually associated with LESCs 33 – 35 . In contrast , the CK3 / 12 - positive epithelial cells from the central cornea were negative for limbal markers ( Fig . 2a – c ) , indicating that these constituted a more differentiated epithelium . The co - location of areas of low - Brillouin shift with the immuno - anatomical limbus was further con ﬁ rmed by the geometry of its features ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , as well as by the expression of ECM components and corresponding cell receptors ( Fig . 2 ) . The distribution of the low - Brillouin shift within limbal sub - epithelial matrix ( Fig . 1e ) , classically identi ﬁ ed as conjunctival stroma and Tenon ’ s capsule 28 , was well correlated to the collagen - I - positive / collagen - V - negative connective tissue immediately underlying the resident LESCs ( Fig . 2a – c ) . Moreover , the focal distribution of laminin - γ 3 , a characteristic marker of limbal basement mem - brane 36 along with the strong expression of integrin - α 9 , a tran - sient amplifying cell / LESC marker 37 , showed that this region corresponded to the corneal limbus ( Fig . 2d ) . The low - Brillouin shift values were also well correlated with the tissue ’ s structural features , previously characterised as comprising less compact collagen lamellae with irregularly arranged , branched , and intertwined collagen bundles 38 , 39 . In contrast , the location of CK3 - positive epithelial cells ( Fig . 2e ) was well correlated to the regions of the central cornea with the highest - Brillouin shift values ( Fig . 1b ) . These regions showed to be comprised by ubi - quitous corneal or conjunctival basement membrane compo - nents , such as collagen - VII 10 and laminin - 1 36 , but not laminin - γ 3 ( Fig . 2d , e ) . Furthermore , the matrix under the central corneal epithelium was strongly positive for both collagen - I and collagen - V ( Fig . 2 ) . This distinctive composition plays an important role on collagen ﬁ bril diameter and lamellar organisation of the cor - neal stoma 40 , which in turn has a critical in ﬂ uence in tissue transparency and elastic modulus 9 , 41 . Signal quanti ﬁ cation also supported the distinctive expression pattern of markers in both limbus and central cornea ( Fig . 2f ) .

These high - resolution scans revealed transversal striæ with high - Brillouin frequency shifts , mostly in the posterior stroma and extending obliquely to the mid or anterior region of the tissue , which probably corresponded to lamellar undulations thought to protect the stromal ultrastructure and shape from external mechanical shocks and the subsequent increase in intraocular pressure 65 . c Representative Y – Z scan of Brillouin frequency shifts of central cornea performed every 2 . 5 µ m , showing a distinct epithelium ( Ep ; depth = 0 – 50 µ m ) , sub - epithelial layer ( Sub ; 50 – 65 µ m ) , and stroma ( St ; > 65 µ m ) , as well as the location of the Bowman ’ s layer ( arrowhead ) . d Representative Y – Z - scan of Brillouin frequency shifts of corneal limbus performed every 5 µ m , showing the epithelium ( depth = 0 – 50 / 60 µ m ) , sub - epithelial layer ( 60 – 120 µ m ) , and stroma ( > 120 µ m ) . e BSM measurements performed through the anterior region of the central cornea and limbus were statistically analysed ( two - way ANOVA ; 100 individual measurements per area , per experiment ) , along with the average ( centre line ) ± S .

Substrate stiffness controls corneal epithelial cell phenotype in vitro . The surprisingly distinct properties between central cornea and the limbus observed by BSM reinforced our hypothesis that biomechanics plays a role in controlling the phenotype of corneal epithelial cells 14 . The stiffer features of the central cornea support the notion that a biomechanical differ - ential ( i . e . , gradient or step - change in substrate stiffness ) plays a crucial role on corneal epithelial cell differentiation via mechan - otransduction 14 , 42 . Indeed , several pathologies compromising corneal integrity are currently managed by collagen cross - linking , where the stiffening of the central cornea 23 ( but not of the lim - bus ) allows the restoration of a healthy differentiated epithe - lium 43 . Conversely , in the limbus , cells residing in the basal epithelial layer predominantly express the inactivated form of YAP , an indication of reduced exposure to mechanical inputs 14 . Moreover , aberrant stiffening of the limbus ( e . g . due to ﬁ brosis ) is associated with pathologies leading to stem cell loss 44 . Assuming that the differences in tissue modulus ( between limbus and cen - tral cornea ) reported here are vital for corneal function / homo - eostasis , then it is reasonable to consider the manipulation of substrate stiffness as an effective therapeutic approach to pro - mote / restore LESC function in damaged corneas . We thus developed a strategy to investigate the response of LESCs to surface compliance , ﬁ rst using an in vitro model . Previously , high - density collagen - I gels ( tissue mimics ) with different levels of stiffness via plastic compression were used to that purpose 45 , 13 . Now we explored the premise that collagen gel stiffness could be modulated locally with topical applications of a type - I collagenase solution ( Fig . 3a ) . Collagen gels treated for up to 60 min were shown to be partially digested , with enzymatic cleavage restricted to the collagenase - soaked areas ( Fig . 3b , P i x e l i n t en s i t y ( % o f c on t r o l a v e r age ) AB C G 2 / C K 3 / D AP I / C o l - V Central Limbus C K 15 / β - C a t / D AP I / C o l - I Central Limbus Δ N p6 3 / α 3 β 1 / D AP I / C o l - I Central Limbus α 9 / Lam - 1 / DAPI / Col - I α 9 / DAPI / Col - I Lam - γ 3 / DAPI Lam - 1 / DAPI Central Limbus CK3 + 12 / Col - VII / DAPI / Col - I Top view a b c d e f 5000 200 150 40 7500 6000 4500 3000 1500 30 20 10 0 100 50 0 200 150 100 50 0 CentreLimbus CentreLimbus CentreLimbus CentreLimbus CentreLimbus 4000 P i x e l i n t en s i t y ( % o f c on t r o l a v e r age ) P i x e l i n t en s i t y ( % o f c on t r o l a v e r age ) P i x e l i n t en s i t y ( % o f c on t r o l a v e r age ) N u c l ea r l o c a t i on ( % o f c on t r o l a v e r age ) 3000 2000 1000 ABCG2 CK15 CK3 CK3 + 12 α 3 β 1 β - Catenin α 9 Lam - γ 3 Lam - 1 Col - VII * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Δ Np63 0 Fig . 2 LESC residency corresponds to limbal regions with distinctly softer mechanical properties .

Expression of limbal markers ABCG2 ( a ) , CK15 ( b ) , and Δ Np63 ( c ) , were expressed by limbal epithelial cells supported by collagen - I - positive / collagen - V - negative matrix , but not by central corneal epithelium ( a – c ) .

Speci ﬁ cally , collagen ﬁ bril morphology was indistinguishable between treated and untreated gels ( Supplementary Fig . 4b , c ) and comparable to that in the literature 46 . Moreover , this partial digestion did not affect the gels ’ average surface roughness ( Supplementary Fig . 4c ) , thus presenting nano - topographical features substantially ﬂ atter than those previously shown to affect LESC phenotype 47 , 48 . However , collagenase greatly reduced gel density , with a 33 ± 16 % dry weight loss and increased 83 ± 4 % hydration after 60 min treatment ( Supplementary Fig . 4d ) , indicating that the enzyme was able to penetrate through the compressed gels despite being applied topically . The lower collagen bulk and higher gel hydration as a function of treatment duration also corresponded to signi ﬁ cant reductions in elastic modulus ( Supplementary Fig . 4e , f ) , with gels treated for 60 min presenting an average E = 0 . 7 ± 0 . 1 MPa , almost an order of magnitude lower compared with mock - treated gels ( E = 5 . 2 ± 1 . 2 MPa ) ( Fig . 3c ) . This difference in gel compliance constituted an important result , as it was subsequently shown to affect corneal epithelial cell phenotype . LESCs isolated from human corneal tissues and grown on softened ( treated ) collagen gels showed a signi ﬁ cantly increased CK15 ( limbal stem / progenitor cell marker ) and decreased CK3 ( differentiated corneal epithelium marker ) expression at both transcriptional and protein levels ( Fig . 3d ; Supplementary Fig . 5a ) , in a well - de ﬁ ned pattern delimited by the boundaries of enzyme treatment ( Fig . 3d ) , and without induced expression of pro - in ﬂ ammatory factors 49 – 51 ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Importantly , cells on collagenase - treated gels also showed a signi ﬁ cant reduction in YAP , both in terms of total expression and nuclear location ( nYAP ) ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) , supporting previous evidence that softer substrates promote LESC phenotype via key YAP - dependent mechanotransduction signalling pathways 14 . Moreover , these cells maintained LESC - characteristic morphologies , with a diameter of 10 – 12 µm and high nucleus - to - cytoplasm ratio ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . In contrast , cell morphology on untreated gels was closer to that of basal epithelial cells from the centre of the cornea 32 . These results indicated that the enzymatic digestion can produce precisely controlled , localised differences in the stiffness of high - density collagen gels , resulting in the removal of up to one - third of the original collagen content from within the gels without altering their volume , nano - structure 46 , or nano - topography 48 , and subsequently maintain undifferentiated LESCs . As such , we then used the collagenase treatment to create a ring of softer collagen ( representing the limbus , having shown by BSM that this tissue is signi ﬁ cantly softer ) surrounding a stiffer area ( representing the central cornea ) . Cells subsequently grown on the treated , outer - ring area ( pseudo - limbus ) expressed higher levels of CK15 , whereas cells on the central , untreated region of the gels displayed higher CK3 expression ( Fig . 3e ) . The ratio between CK3 - positive and CK15 - positive cells increased after 4 weeks in culture , mainly due to increased cell strati ﬁ cation over time . However , the maintenance of CK15 expression by LESCs on collagen gels was , overall , substantially higher than on in ﬁ nite - stiffness substrates ( i . e . tissue culture plastic ) at equivalent stages in culture ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Moreover , these effects were independent of the presence of any potential cryptic epitopes exposed by collagenase treatment ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Substrate stiffness controls corneal epithelial cell phenotype ex vivo . Based on these in vitro results , the application of col - lagenase could represent an effective and safe treatment to help restore appropriate levels of tissue compliance to a diseased ( stiffer ) limbus , and thus promote LESC maintenance and func - tion . Collagenase could also be used on the central cornea to alter the mechanical properties of its matrix towards obtaining a more compliant , limbus - like environment . In other words , collagenase could be used to extend or even restructure a ‘ new ’ limbus within the periphery of the cornea , and thus provide resident or trans - planted LESCs with a suitable alternative mechanical niche . To test this possibility , we applied collagenase ex vivo to well - delimited central areas of freshly enucleated human corneas ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) and analysed the softening effect by BSM ( Fig . 4a ) . As predicted from the plastically compressed collagen gel study , topical collagenase application to the human cornea resulted in lower Brillouin frequency shifts in the collagenase - treated , but not in mock - treated areas of the cornea ( Fig . 4a ) , and with no loss of accuracy ( Supplementary Fig . 8b ) . Speci ﬁ cally , the collagenase treatment signi ﬁ cantly lowered the Brillouin fre - quency shift in the central sub - epithelial and anterior stroma matrix compared to controls ( Fig . 4b ) while surprisingly main - taining the epithelium layers in place , albeit in a less evenly dis - tributed pattern ( Fig . 4b , right panel ) . Notably , the Brillouin frequency shift from the treated sub - epithelial matrix of the central cornea ( 6 . 45 ± 0 . 13 GHz ) was statistically similar and presented a similar variation to that of the sub - epithelium from the control ( untreated ) limbus ( 6 . 34 ± 0 . 07 GHz ) ( Fig . 4c ) . This indicated that collagenase treatments can soften the central cor - nea towards a limbus - like level of compliance . The altered mechanical properties of the collagenase - treated central cornea were in part derived from the degradation of the collagen - rich matrix of the anterior stroma , including the Bowman ’ s layer ( Fig . 4b ) . However , collagenase was equally effective in softening the normal corneal limbus ( where the Bowman ’ s layer is absent ) , with localised ex vivo treatments signi ﬁ cantly reducing matrix stiffness ( Supplementary Fig . 8c ) , namely at the sub - epithelium level ( Fig . 4c ) . Confocal immuno - ﬂ uorescence analysis showed that the basement membrane in the central cornea was also affected , presenting large gaps in the distribution of collagen - VII and laminin - 1 following collagenase treatment ( Fig . 4d ) . Nonetheless , after careful debridement through washing , both treated and control central corneas successfully served as ex vivo growth substrate for LESCs , supporting re - epithelialisation ( Fig . 4e ) and basement membrane re - deposition ( Fig . 4d ) . Similarly to their behaviour on collagen gels , cells grown on softened areas of the central cornea continued to express limbal markers , such as CK15 and ABCG2 , particularly at the basal layers of the new epithelium ( Fig . 4e ) . Furthermore , they deposited focalised laminin - γ 3 and expressed integrin - α 9 ( Fig . 4f ) , two markers characteristic of the limbal niche 36 , 37 . In contrast , cells grown on mock - treated areas of the central cornea failed to express any of these markers . Signal quanti ﬁ cation showed that this differential expression was signi ﬁ cant for all markers tested ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Substrate stiffness controls corneal epithelial cell phenotype in vivo . Next , we investigated the effects of substrate stiffness on corneal epithelial cells in vivo , using collagenase to soften the central region of rabbit corneas ( Fig . 5 ) . The outcome of col - lagenase treatment on intact rabbit corneas ( i . e . without prior debridement ) was followed by clinical observation , slit - lamp biomicroscopy , and immunohistochemistry analyses 1 and 5 days post - intervention ( Fig . 5a ) . Interestingly , the in vivo softening elicited a radical change in epithelial cell phenotype , with mole - cular markers showing major differences in expression compared to corresponding controls ( mock - treated rabbit corneas ; Fig . 5b ) , in line with the effects obtained in vitro ( with collagen gels ) and ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 09331 - 6 6 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 1496 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 09331 - 6 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications ex vivo ( with organ - cultured human corneas ) . Speci ﬁ cally , epi - thelial cells residing on the softened centre of rabbit corneas were shown to express CK15 , ABCG2 , Δ Np63 , laminin - γ 3 , and integrin - α 9 5 days after treatment ( Fig . 5b ) . Conversely , softening the central cornea induced a reduction in CK3 / 12 expression in the epithelium and resulted in a partially degraded basement membrane , as shown by the reduced levels of collagen - IV and collagen - VII ( Fig . 5b ) . In addition , the mechanotransduction factor YAP changed drastically in softened corneas , with CK15 - positive cells showing reduced YAP expression and loss of its active ( nuclear ) form ( nYAP ) compared to that in CK3 - positive cells from mock - treated corneas ( Fig . 5c ) . These differences in expression were signi ﬁ cant ( Fig . 5b , c , graphs ) , and represented important alterations in the normal phenotype of epithelial cells from the central cornea . In particular , the signi ﬁ cant reduction ( p = 0 . 0002 ) of the active nYAP in the basal epithelium following collagenase treatment demonstrated that softer substrates indeed promoted YAP inactivation , and further supported the notion of YAP - mediated mechanotransduction playing a crucial role in de ﬁ ning LESC phenotype in vivo .

Furthermore , no conspicuous neo - vascularisation was observed following collagenase treatment of the cornea either on a mac - roscopic ( Fig . 5a ) or microscopic level ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . The maintenance of an intact epithelium and its corresponding barrier function , even after collagenase treatment , was probably the main factor protecting the corneas from these deleterious effects ( Fig . 5a ) . Collagenase treatment restores limbus capacity to support LESCs after alkali burn . Finally , to further explore the potential clinical relevance of modulating tissue biomechanics , collagenase was used to soften the arti ﬁ cially stiffened limbus in alkali - burned corneas . This type of injury was chosen for its extensive prior use to model corneal pathologies causing corneal ﬁ brosis and stif - fening , as well as LESC de ﬁ ciency ( LSCD ) and loss . In the ﬁ rst of these preliminary experiments , human corneas subjected to alkali burns ex vivo were treated with collagenase and tested for their mechanical properties , as well as their ability to support cells with a LESC - like phenotype ( Fig . 6 ) . As expected , the alkali burn led to major alterations in the corneal limbus , with clearance of most of its non - ﬁ brillar elements and the signi ﬁ cant , localised , and con - sistent stiffening of its matrix ( Fig . 6a and b ) . These effects were probably due to proteoglycan removal following alkali expo - sure 52 . Subsequently , alkali - burned corneas also failed to main - tain the LESC - like phenotype of repopulating cells . Speci ﬁ cally , LESCs seeded on the limbus of alkali - burned corneas showed signi ﬁ cantly reduced expression of limbal markers ABCG2 , CK15 , Δ Np63 , and integrin - α 9 , while expressing higher levels of differentiation marker CK3 compared to cells on non - burned , control tissue ( Fig . 6c and d ) . In addition , cells on the burned limbus showed a signi ﬁ cant increase in YAP expression and nuclear localisation ( p = 0 . 0003 and 0 . 0002 , respectively ) com - pared to those on control tissues ( Fig . 6e ) , suggesting that phe - notype loss was driven by YAP - dependent mechanotransduction signalling . However , all deleterious effects were shown to be reversed by application of collagenase on alkali - burned corneas , with treatment leading to reduced collagen ﬁ bril density and signi ﬁ cant decrease in the stiffness of the limbus matrix ( Fig . 6a and b ) . But most importantly , the recovery of the original tissue compliance was accompanied by the ability to support re - epithelialisation by cells expressing limbal stem / progenitor cell markers ( Fig . 6c and d ) . Furthermore , and as expected from our preceding experiments , this response was accompanied by a signi ﬁ cant reduction in YAP expression and nuclear localisation ( Fig . 6e ) . Similar results were observed in a second set of experiments , this time using an in vivo chemical burn model . Rabbit corneas subjected to a localised alkali burn had the temporal half of the limbus damaged while maintaining its nasal half intact , to allow re - epithelialisation ( Supplementary Fig . 11 , day 0 ) . On the second day post - burn , the affected areas of the limbus were either treated with collagenase ( treated ) or remained untreated ( alkali ) ( Supplementary Table 2 ) , and were subsequently compared to undamaged limbal tissue ( control ) . Immediately after the burn , the affected area of the limbus became opaque ( Fig . 7a ) . In untreated corneas , this haze showed little or no reduction in size ( Fig . 7b ) . In contrast , collagenase - treated tissues showed a signi ﬁ cant reduction of haze area compared with alkali - burn tissues ( p = 0 . 0023 ) and with time ( 90 ± 3 – 56 ± 5 % of initial size from day 2 to 7 , respectively ; p = 0 . 002 ) ( Fig . 7b ) , probably through restoration of epithelial integrity and barrier function ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . Furthermore , treating the burned limbus with collagenase allowed the tissue ’ s native cellular pro ﬁ le to be restored ( Fig . 7c ) . Speci ﬁ cally , the new epithelium populating the collagenase - treated burned limbus tissue showed signi ﬁ cantly higher expression of limbal markers CK15 , Δ Np63 , ABCG2 , and integrin - α 9 , and lower expression of differentiation markers CK3 and α 3 β 1 compared with their untreated ( alkali ) tissue counterparts , and an expression pro ﬁ le similar to the undamaged ( control ) limbus ( Fig . 7c and d ) . These cells probably originated from the neighbouring nasal limbus kept intact during the challenge . Furthermore , the reduction of haze during the healing process ( Fig . 7a ) and the absence of goblet cells in the new epithelium ( Fig . 7c ; Supplementary Fig . 12 ) suggested that the repair was not made by transdifferentiating conjunctival cells . Alternatively , the new epithelium might have derived from dedifferentiation of corneal committed cells , as recently shown to occur in mice after surgical deletion of LESCs , but not after alkali burn of the limbus 6 . Interestingly , YAP expression in cells repopulating collagenase - treated tissues was similar to that on the undamaged limbus , and signi ﬁ cantly ( p = 0 . 0015 ) lower to that on tissues made stiffer by the alkali burn ( Fig . 7e ) . Cells growing on treated tissues also presented signi ﬁ cantly ( p = 0 . 019 ) lower levels of nuclear YAP compared to those on alkali tissues , namely in basal layers of the epithelium ( Fig . 7e ) , where Δ Np63 showed particularly strong expression . Moreover , and as previously observed in collagen gels and the central cornea , the variations in YAP expression in the limbus were independent from substrate topography , with application of alkali and / or collagenase showing no evident alterations in limbal nano - or micro - topographical features ( Figs . 6 and 7 , respectively ) .

Subsequently , we showed that the corneal epithelial cell phenotype can be con - trolled through modulating the mechanical properties of collagen - rich substrates , both natural ( i . e . , the cornea ) and manufactured ( i . e . , compressed collagen gels ) . In particular , the collagenase type - I formulation used in this study provided a simple but ef ﬁ cient method to soften such substrates to reproduce the compliance of the limbus , and thus ( re ) create its biological function as a niche for epithelial stem / progenitor cell main - tenance . This was illustrated in vitro in our pseudo - limbus experiments , where cells residing on collagen gels treated with collagenase retained an undifferentiated , LESC - like phenotype whilst cells on stiffer , untreated collagen gels ( pseudo - central cornea ) assumed a differentiated phenotype . This modulation of cell behaviour depended on the substrates ’ biomechanical similarity with the natural limbus , and not on their structural complexity ( e . g . , tissue topography or geometry ) and / or Intact cornea Collagenase Baseline Softened Control Day 1 S li t - l a m p S li t - l a m p C on t r o l C on t r o l C on t r o l C on t r o l C on t r o l C on t r o l C on t r o l S o ft ened S o ft ened S o ft ened S o ft ened S o ft ened S o ft ened S o ft ened Baseline Softened Control Day 5 α 3 β 1 / C o l - I V / D AP I α 9 / La m - γ 3 / D AP I C K 3 + 12 / C o l - V II / D AP I C K 3 + 12 / Δ N p63 / D AP I YAP / C K 15 / D AP I YAP / C K 3 / D AP I C K 15 / AB C G 2 / D AP I 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 0 P i x e l i n t en s i t y ( % o f c on t r o l a v e r age ) P i x e l i n t en s i t y ( % o f c on t r o l a v e r age ) 200 150 100 50 0 A B C G 2 C K 15 La m - γ 3 Δ N p63 α 9 C o l - V II C o l - I V α 3 β 1 C K 3 + 12 P i x e l i n t en s i t y ( % o f c on t r o l a v e r age ) n YAP e x p r e ss i on ( % o f c e ll s ) 150 125 100 75 50 25 0 150 125 100 75 50 25 0 Control Control * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Softened Softened Control Softened * * * * * Nuclear YAP Total YAP a b c Fig . 5 Softening of central corneal tissue with collagenase increases expression of limbal markers in vivo . a Schematic representation of the collagenase treatment method used to soften the central region of intact corneas in live rabbits .

Both collagenase - treated and semi - compressed gels have comparable topographies , moduli , and phenotype - modulating properties ; however , the latter are produced by variations in time and load of plastic compression 13 , and therefore their ability to maintain undifferentiated LESCs cannot be attributed to newly exposed cryptic epitopes or changes in topography .

Using this enzyme to soften the matrix of the anterior layers of the central cornea allowed the ( re ) creation of a limbus - like mechanical and phenotypic milieu , both in vivo and ex vivo , without compromising the tissue ’ s integrity , or causing any measurable in ﬂ ammatory or neo - vascularisation responses ( Fig . 8 ) . Crucially , this can have important and extensive applications , namely as a non - hormonal therapeutic method to soften pathologically hardened natural tissues , such as scared corneas . Previous studies reported that alterations of the mechanical properties of the corneal limbus , namely involving its stiffening , can result in LSCD 47 , metaplasia 44 , and consequently to vision loss 53 , 54 . Furthermore , a damaged limbal micro - environment can limit the use of therapeutic procedures based on LESC transplantation , as the newly transplanted cells are poten - tially negatively affected by a still - compromised substrate in the post - injury cornea , or by the improper mechanical properties of the graft . Such notion is supported by evidence that LESCs cul - tured on stiffer , polystyrene substrates without feeder layers show a progressive phenotype change 55 . Furthermore , the LESC phe - notype has been shown to be reduced when grown upon human amniotic membrane made stiffer after UV treatment 12 or debri - dement 56 . In contrast , LESCs used therapeutically to treat LSCD are currently expanded ex vivo on ﬁ brin gels 57 , a substrate whose elastic modulus of 0 . 3 – 0 . 5 MPa falls within the range measured for our collagenase - treated ( softened ) collagen gels . These cases provide further evidence that substrate stiffness plays a funda - mental role in maintaining LESC phenotype , and that the ability to predict and control the mechanical properties of a substrate may lead to better therapeutic outcomes . Our animal experiments suggested that collagenase can also be used in vivo to restore a more suitable mechanical environment for endogenous LESCs in alkali - burned corneas . Speci ﬁ cally , we demonstrated that collagenase effectively reversed the stiffening of the corneal limbus following alkali burn , preventing the con - sequent activation of cellular YAP , and allowing the recovery of its natural LESC - supporting capacity . These ﬁ ndings further supported the role of YAP as a key molecular mediator of corneal mechanotransduction pathways , with increased stiffness of the limbus leading to YAP ’ s increased nuclear translocation , activa - tion , induced cell differentiation , and subsequent loss of LESC phenotype ( Fig . 9 , alkali ) . Conversely , restoring the mechanical properties of the natural limbus ( i . e . , by using collagenase to soften its matrix ) prevented YAP activation and contributed to LESC maintenance and epithelial recovery ( Fig . 9 , treated ) . This modulation of cell phenotype probably occurs via the regulation of YAP - dependent transcription factors Wnt / β - catenin 58 and Sox9 59 ( Fig . 9 ) , recently shown to control the expression of corneal epithelial stem / progenitor cell and differentiation mar - kers , namely CK15 and CK3 60 . The impact of these mechan - otransduction signalling pathways on LESC phenotype merit extensive , in - depth investigation , and should be the subject of future studies along with other potential collagenase - induced effects ( e . g . , changes in density / af ﬁ nity of cell adhesion ligands , matrix hydration and composition , and cytoskeleton and nuclear matrix organisation ) 17 . Together , our results provide evidence for the potential of collagenase as a safe corneal treatment to promote and maintain epithelial stem / progenitor cell function . Firstly , they showed that discrete collagenase application allows the modulation of corneal biomechanics without compromising stromal structure and the tissues ’ overall shape . This is important , as a signi ﬁ cant disrup - tion of the stromal matrix can constitute the basis of several corneal ectatic disorders , including keratoconus 61 . Secondly , collagenase was effective even when applied topically on intact corneas . This advantage obviates the need to remove the epi - thelium prior to treatment , thus preventing the clinical compli - cations caused by corneal debridement . Thirdly , collagenase treatments failed to elicit any major pro - in ﬂ ammatory response in vivo or from epithelial cells in vitro . This point is crucial , as severe in ﬂ ammation of the ocular surface has been associated with corneal injury and disease leading to LESC loss 62 , namely through mechanotransduction pathways 44 . This data also sug - gested that collagenase treatments could be considered as a sui - table adjunct to LESC transplantation in total LSCD cases ( e . g . , by softening the stromal host tissue ) , with lower risks of post - op complications due to in ﬂ ammation . However , further studies will be necessary before this treatment can be used in a clinical ophthalmology setting . In particular , collagenase treatment should be tested on corneal tissues from human LSCD patients ( e . g . , caused by chemical burns ) ex vivo to investigate if increased stiffness varies with injury severity , and understand if adjustments in treatment protocol are required for each individual . In addi - tion , collagenase treatments will have to be evaluated in vivo in longer - term experiments , to determine how enduring the bene - ﬁ cial effects are , and to monitor for any late adverse effects . In conclusion , this study demonstrates the strong correlation between corneal tissue compliance , YAP - dependent mechan - otransduction , and epithelial cell phenotype , using a combination of techniques , such as the non - contact , high - resolution BSM , advanced organ culture , and in vivo modulation of tissue bio - mechanics . Speci ﬁ cally , our experiments showed that compliant substrates support the growth of undifferentiated LESCs with suppressed YAP signalling , whereas stiffer substrates promoted YAP activation while eliciting cell differentiation , both in vivo and ex vivo . Moreover , we applied this phenomenon to the Fig . 6 Softening of alkali - burned corneal tissue with collagenase restores expression of limbal markers ex vivo . a Representative topography of limbal sub - epithelial matrix after application of PBS ( control ) , 0 . 5 M NaOH ( alkali ) , or NaOH followed by collagenase softening ( treated ) of whole human corneas , analysed by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) .

This was clearly demonstrated using rabbit corneas , in which stiff areas ( normally associated with differentiated cells ) were softened and subsequently shown to then support a population of limbal - like undifferentiated cells . The use of enzymes to regulate stem cell phenotype in situ may represent a considerable advance towards developing new therapies based on the modulation of stem / cancer cell mechanotransduction and tissue biomechanics 17 , 18 .

Brie ﬂ y , stiffening of the limbus caused by alkali burn induces the activation and nuclear translocation of YAP , a key regulator of mechanotransduction . The nuclear YAP then acts as a transcription factor , promoting Wtn / β - catenin and suppressing Sox9 signalling , which in turn induce cell differentiation and lead to loss of LESCs . By softening the burned limbus with collagenase , repopulating stem / progenitor cells retain a mostly inactive YAP , with corresponding high Sox9 and low Wtn / β - catenin levels promoting LESC phenotype maintenance System complexity Control Treated Control Treated Control Treated Stiffer matrix Softer matrix ↑ Limbal markers ↑ Limbal morphology ↓ Differentiation markers ↓ Active YAP ↓ Inflammation markers In vitro ( compressed collagen gels ) Stiffer matrix Softer matrix ↑ Limbal markers ↑ Limbal morphology ↑ Corneal integrity ↓ Differentiation markers ↓ Active YAP ↓ Inflammation markers Ex vivo ( human central corneal explants ) Stiffer matrix ( centre ) Softer matrix Softermatrix ( limbus ) ↑ Limbal markers ↑ Limbal morphology ↑ Corneal integrity ↓ Differentiation markers ↓ Active YAP No inflammation No neo - vascularisation In vivo ( rabbit corneas , centre ) Fig . 8 Consistency of overall results from the multiple experimental model systems under study . Epithelial cells ( re ) populating collagenase - softened ( treated ) substrates expressed signi ﬁ cantly higher levels of limbal markers and lower levels of differentiation and active mechanotransduction markers compared to the untreated ( control ) tissues , independently of the system ’ s degree of complexity ( i . e . , topography , biochemical composition ) . In addition , the maintenance of limbal cell morphology and failure to elicit major pro - in ﬂ ammatory responses after tissue softening were similarly observed for all in vitro , ex vivo , and in vivo experiments . The comparable results obtained on both simple and complex substrates supported the notion that the cellular effects were derived from the modulation of tissue biomechanics , and not due to tissue topography or composition ( i . e . , exposure to cryptic biochemical cues or growth factors ) NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 09331 - 6 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 1496 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 09331 - 6 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 13 line - scanning - BSM 63 and ﬂ uorescence emission - BSM 64 , this work also opens multiple areas of research in mechanobiology , particularly regarding the use of this technology to study the biomechanics of corneal structural features 65 , as well as stem / cancer cells and their corresponding niches within live tissues , in real time , and with unparalleled accuracy , speed , and resolution . Methods Corneal tissue sourcing . Human corneas analysed by Brillouin spectro - microscopy ( BSM ) were obtained whole , surrounded by a scleral ring , from the National Disease Research Interchange ( NDRI , PA , USA ) from cadaveric donors ( n = 3 , ages ranging 42 – 74 years old ) . Isolated tissues were kept in dextran - containing Carry - C preservative medium ( Alchimia , Italy ) , in refrigerated condi - tions during transport , and at room temperature during BSM analysis to maintain the cornea ’ s natural hydration state , thickness , and transparency . Corneas used for isolation of LESCs or organ culture were kindly provided by Dr . Francisco Fig - ueiredo , Royal Victoria In ﬁ rmary , Newcastle - upon - Tyne , UK . A total of 18 corneas were obtained from cadaverous human donors ( ages between 27 and 76 ; average ± S . D . = 47 ± 18 years ; male – female donor ratio of 2 : 3 ) following informed consent of use for research purposes . All corneas were sourced from donors with no prior history of corneal diseases or ocular trauma and in accordance with the Newcastle University and Newcastle - upon - Tyne Hospital Trust Research Ethics Committees ’ guidelines , and were used within 2 weeks of collection . Brillouin spectro - microscope setup . The Brillouin spectro - microscope consisted of a confocal microscope coupled to a spectrometer , with a tunable interferometric ﬁ lter inserted in between to suppress parasitic elastic scattering ( Fig . 1a ) . The single mode illumination ( transverse and longitudinal ) was provided using a frequency doubled Nd : YVO 4 diode - pumped solid - state 671 nm laser ( CNI , China ) operating at 100 mW and coupled into a ﬁ bre with a spectral linewidth smaller than 1 MHz , with a 3mm ⌀ beam collimated output , re ﬂ ected off a pair of scanning mirrors ( Thorlabs , NJ , USA ) , and expanded to an 8mm ⌀ by two achromatic doublets ( 75 and 180 mm focal length ) to ﬁ ll the back focal plane of a ×20 immersion objective ( NA = 0 . 5 ) . A quarter - wave plate inserted just before the objective was used to obtain laser circular polarisation . Scattered light was collected by the same objec - tive , de - scanned by the same mirrors , separated from the excitation light by a polarising beam - splitter , and coupled into a single - mode ﬁ bre also acting as con - focal pinhole . The elastically scattered light was ﬁ ltered by destructive interference using a glass prism allowing the passage of inelastically scattered ( Brillouin ) light , with a piezoelectric actuator to provide a simple feedback mechanism via periodical adjustment of the interferometer angle to produce a 10 % modulation in the ( post - ﬁ ltering ) elastic amplitude 22 . Light exiting the ﬁ lter output ﬁ bre was collimated to a 0 . 8mm ⌀ and focused on the entrance window of a VIPA ( Light Machinery , Canada ) with 30GHz free spectral range using a 100 mm cylindrical lens . A 400 mm cylindrical lens imaged the VIPA ’ s angular spectrum onto a iXon CCD camera ( Andor , UK ) operated in non - electron - multiplying mode , with the help of a 50mm cylindrical lens , orientated orthogonal to the others , to provide focusing along the non - dispersed axis . BSM imaging and analysis . Imaging of fresh human corneas was performed by submerging tissues in Carry - C medium inside a Petri dish mounted on a vertical translation stage ( Newport MFA - CC ) . The different regions of the cornea were positioned pre - imaging under bright - ﬁ eld , with the corneal limbus identi ﬁ ed by the presence of characteristic features such as Palisades of Vogt , focal stromal pro - jections , and pigmented epithelial cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . By measuring the optical frequency shift of the scattered light , Brillouin scanning can probe the local spontaneous pressure waves within biological tissues , from which the longitudinal modulus can be evaluated 66 . The measured Brillouin shifts were obtained by ﬁ tting the Stokes and anti - Stokes components of the spectra with Lorentzian function line pro ﬁ les using non - linear least squares ( SciPy optimised curve ﬁ t ) , and the ampli - tude of the ﬁ tted Lorentzian giving the strength of the spectral signal . The Brillouin shift for the backscatter geometry was given by Δ ν B ¼ 2 = λ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ M = ρ p , where λ is the optical wavelength in the sample , and M and ρ correspond to the longitudinal modulus and density of the sample , respectively 22 . Relating the hypersonic ( GHz ) modulus directly to the quasi - static modulus and Young ’ s modulus is complicated by acoustic dispersion , which can increase moduli signi ﬁ cantly at GHz frequencies . Moreover , the effects of sample - induced aberrations can be substantial when imaging deep into the corneal samples , as the point - spread function of the confocal system is rapidly degraded with aberrations , greatly reducing the signal from the focal region . Although the Brillouin shift is not dependent on the signal strength , signal reduction is associated with a relative increase in contributions from regions above and below focus . This results in crosstalk , averaging of the measured Bril - louin shift , and degradation of the z - sectioning for regions below strong sample inhomogeneity . Such regions are indicated by large reductions ( two or more orders of magnitude ) in the amplitude of the Lorentzian ﬁ tted to the spectrum , relative to that from the immersion medium above the sample , which is unaffected . However , the technique does provide information about variations and changes in mechanical properties at submicron scale 64 , and the imaging of the anterior cornea was consistent with and not impacted by reduced signal strength or aberrations ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Brillouin patterns were also not substantially affected by a possible heterogeneous penetration of Carry - C in the corneal tissue , as signi ﬁ cant differences in frequency shift between the corneal sub - epithelium in the centre and the limbus were similarly observed with other immersion media ( 15 and 13 . 5GHz in glycerol ; 6 . 4 and 6 . 1GHz in PBS , respectively ) 22 . Collagen gel production . Plastic - compressed , high - density collagen gels were made by neutralising sterile rat - tail type - I collagen ( 2 . 2 mg mL − 1 in 0 . 6 % acetic acid ; First Link Ltd , UK ) in 10× modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s medium ( MEM ; Thermo Sci - enti ﬁ c ) and 1M sodium hydroxide ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at an 8 : 1 : 1 volume ratio . The solution was gently mixed and cast into circular moulds ( 2 mL per 1 . 9cm 2 ⌀ wells in 12 - well plates ) prior to gelling for 30 min at 37 °C . Collagen gels were then fully compressed between two layers of nylon mesh ( 50 µm mesh size ) under a ﬁ xed load of 134 g for 5min , or semi - compressed with 64 g for 2 . 5min at room tem - perature , and then coated with laminin ( 1 . 5 × 10 − 6 g cm − 2 ; Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) for 2 h prior to cell seeding 11 , 12 . Fully compressed collagen gels were also coated with the matrix extracted from human corneas , to account for the possible in ﬂ uence of natural corneal biochemical cues on cell phenotype . Brie ﬂ y , stromal tissues isolated from either the central or limbus regions of three human corneas were minced and digested with 1× 10 4 activity unitsL − 1 of collagenase type - I from Clostridium histolyticum ( # 17018 - 029 , Life Technologies ) in PBS for 60 min at 37 °C . Stroma and limbus protein extracts were then precipitated by incubation with 4× volume of ice - cold ethanol overnight at − 20 °C , followed by centrifugation at 10 , 000 × g for 10 min at 4°C , and resuspended in PBS . The different corneal extracts were drop - spotted onto compressed collagen gels at 5× 10 − 5 gcm − 2 , and allowed to dry overnight to create a continuous coating . Collagenase treatments . Tissue softening was performed by applying sterile col - lagenase type - I from C . histolyticum . Dose and time of incubation were optimised to reproduce the biomechanical and functional properties of semi - compressed collagen gels 13 or of the human corneal limbus . Brie ﬂ y , lyophilised collagenase powder was solubilised in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) at 5×10 − 2 gL − 1 ( 1×10 4 activity units L − 1 ) and then applied onto sterilised Whatman Grade 1 ﬁ lter paper until saturation , i . e . , ~ 0 . 2 mLcm − 2 of paper . The collagenase - soaked paper cut - outs were then gently applied onto the surface of dense collagen gels and incubated for up to 60 min at 37 °C . Treatment of whole human corneas was performed by positioning fresh enucleated corneas with their anterior surface up , and then placing collagenase - soaked ﬁ lter paper cut - outs over half of their central region ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) for 60min at 37°C ( 2 units cm − 2 h − 1 of total collagenase activity , a dose appropriate to consistently soften surfaces to a limbus - like stiffness ) . The collagenase - soaked ﬁ lter paper cut - outs were subsequently discarded , and gels or corneas washed thrice with PBS for 15min on a rocker agitator to remove remaining enzyme and digestion - derived soluble products . PBS - soaked ﬁ lter paper cut - outs were incubated for 1h using a similar method , in order to produce mock - treated specimens ( treatment time = 0min ) . Collagen gels treated for different durations were imaged by bright - ﬁ eld photography using a Nikon DSRL digital camera ( Nikon , Japan ) immediately after washes , whereas corneas were immersed in Carry - C medium to maintain the cornea ’ s natural hydration state and then imaged by BSM , or used in organ culture . Hydration analysis . Collagen gel weight was measured before treatment ( initial weight , W i ) and after treating the entire surface of gels with collagenase for dif - ferent durations ( ﬁ nal weight , W f ) . The loss of mass due to collagenase treatment ( Δ W ) was evaluated for each duration of treatment using the equation Δ W = W f / W i , whereas the hydration of treated gels was evaluated by weighting the collagen gels after desiccation using a benchtop Freeze Dry System ( Cole - Palmer , IL , USA ) . Brie ﬂ y , gels subjected to different treatments were frozen at − 54 °C to allow water sublimation under controlled pressure for 12 h and their dry weight ( W d ) measured immediately after . Gel hydration was subsequently calculated as the ratio of ( W f − W d ) / W f and expressed as a percentage . The experiment was performed using 10 independent gels for each duration of treatment ( n = 10 ) . Isolation and culture of corneal limbal epithelial cells . Human LESCs were isolated from the limbus region of a total of nine corneal rings following removal of scleral tissue and the central 7mm ( used for keratectomy ) . Brie ﬂ y , ring tissues were dissected into quarters , plated in six - well plates , and subsequently incubated for 5 days in 4mL of supplemented CnT - 7 medium ( CellNTec , Switzerland ) at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 , to allow the migration and attachment of LESCs onto the culture plate surface while maintaining cell proliferation and extended viability . The cor - neal tissue was then removed from the plates , and attached cells allowed to pro - liferate for an additional week , with culture medium change every 2 days . Cell monolayers reaching 70 – 80 % con ﬂ uence were passaged using Accutase cell detachment solution ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) for 10 min at 37 °C , and re - plated at 3× 10 4 cells cm 2 , up to passage 4 , with cells from each donor used separately . Organ culture of human corneas . Collagenase - treated whole human corneas were transferred into Transwell culture inserts , washed 3× 5min and scraped with an excess of sterile PBS using a rubber - blade cell scraper ( Sarstedt ) to detach and ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 09331 - 6 14 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 1496 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 09331 - 6 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications remove the loosened epithelium , and then seeded with 5 ×10 5 LESCs in 2mL of CnT - 7 medium . Corneas mock - treated with PBS were used as non - softened con - trols , using a rigid cell scraper ( Corning ) to remove the epithelium . The complete removal of epithelial cells was performed and veri ﬁ ed in both treated and control conditions using a bright - ﬁ eld microscope . For the ex vivo alkali burn model , human corneas were similarly processed after treatment with strips of ﬁ lter paper soaked with 0 . 5 M of NaOH ( alkali ) or sterile PBS ( control ) for 60s , followed by 3× 5min washes with an excess of sterile PBS . A subgroup of alkali burn corneas were also subsequently subjected to collagenase treatment , as described . Organ culture was performed at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 in CnT - 7 medium for 2 weeks , fol - lowed by a 1 - week period in SHEM and air - lifting 13 , with media change every 2 days . The central region of collagenase - treated and control corneas was mon - itored daily by bright - ﬁ eld microscopy to evaluate re - epithelialisation , and analysed by confocal immuno ﬂ uorescence microscopy , as described above . Experiments were performed three independent times ( n = 3 ) , each with cells and corneal tissue from independent donors . Confocal immuno ﬂ uorescence microscopy . Collagen gels were washed in PBS , blocked in PBS supplemented with 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 1h , incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti - collagen type - I primary antibody ( Supplementary Table 3 ) diluted 1 : 500 in blocking buffer , washed vigorously 4 ×15 min in PBS , and incubated in the dark for 2h at room temperature with Alexa 594 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) diluted 1 : 1000 in blocking buffer . After another 4× 15min washes with PBS , gels were immersed in Vectashield anti - fade medium ( Vector Laboratories , UK ) , mounted on glass slides , and imaged by confocal ﬂ uorescence microscopy using a Nikon A1 , with 1 µm - thick optical sections . Fresh human corneal tissues were ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and then sectioned in thick slices ( 0 . 5 – 0 . 8mm ) encompassing the central cornea , limbus , and sclera . Individual corneal slices were then blocked in PBS supplemented with 5 % BSA and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 3h , incubated overnight at room temperature with primary antibodies ( Supplementary Table 3 ) diluted 1 : 500 in blocking buffer , washed 4× 1h in PBS , incubated in the dark for 4h at room temperature with the corresponding secondary antibodies and DAPI ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) diluted 1 : 1000 in blocking buffer , washed again 4 ×1 h in PBS , and mounted onto glass slides . Data was analysed using the NIS - Elements and the ImageJ v . 1 . 7 software suite , with quanti ﬁ cation of expression performed by evaluating pixel intensity for each independent channel , and normalised against percentage of average pixel intensity of corresponding control . Representative images were taken from each indepen - dent gel or corneal tissue sample , for all experiments . Atomic force microscopy . Analysis of surface topography of collagen gels treated with collagenase for different durations was performed in static force ( contact ) mode using an Easyscan 2 - controlled FlexAFM atomic force microscope ( Nano - surf , Switzerland ) equipped with commercial soft contact mode cantilevers ( Con - tAI - G , Budget Sensors , Bulgaria ) with a resonant frequency of 13 kHz , and nominal spring constant of 0 . 2N / m . Semi - compressed and coated collagen gels were similarly analysed . Brie ﬂ y , the different collagen gel samples were mounted onto glass slides that were previously covered with a layer of silicone ﬁ lm to avoid the underlying surface to in ﬂ uence measurements , and minimise sample displacement and drift . Surface topography was analysed from three separate regions in each sample , with 512 ×two - direction lines scanned at 10 µms − 1 , 10nV , and with a P - gain and I - gain of 1 . Surface topography maps were line - ﬁ tted and represented in false colour with a z - scale of 500 nm . The mechanical properties of the collagen gel samples were evaluated by force – distance spectroscopy . The stiffness of the gels was evaluated from 100 force – distance curves acquired at 2µm s − 1 from different positions across each sample , and using SPIP data analysis software ( Image Metrology A / S , Denmark ) for baseline and hysteresis correction , followed by elastic modulus calculation using the Sneddon model , applicable for soft biological materials 67 . Elastic modulus was represented in scatter - dot plots or in terms of frequency , in percentage of measured values , within 0 . 2 and 1 . 0MPa bins . All experiments were performed three independent times ( n = 3 ) . Quantitative immuno ﬂ uorescence analysis . Collagen gels treated with col - lagenase across half their surface or in a ring - shape area for 60min were laminin - coated , seeded with 3× 10 5 LESCs , and incubated in CnT - 7 medium at 37°C for up to 4 weeks . Cells were grown on laminin - coated tissue culture plastic for corre - sponding periods of time , as in ﬁ nite - stiffness substrate controls . Subsequently , samples were washed twice in PBS , ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in water for 20min at room temperature , and washed again with excess PBS . Cells were then permeabilised in PBS containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( PBS - T ) for 5min , blocked with blocking buffer ( PBS - T containing 5 % BSA ) for 1h , incubated with the rabbit anti - CK3 or anti - CK15 antibodies ( Supplementary Table 3 ) diluted 1 : 1000 in blocking buffer for 4h at room temperature , washed again for 3× 15min in blocking buffer , and incubated with IRDye 800CW goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody and CellTag 700 stain diluted 1 : 1000 in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature . Samples were ﬁ nally washed 3 ×15 min in PBS - T before being imaged by near - infrared quantitative analysis using an Odyssey CLx System ( Li - Cor Biosciences ) . Signal speci ﬁ city was evaluated from samples incubated without either primary or secondary antibodies . The intensity of signal corresponding to cellular CK3 and CK15 detection was determined for the collagenase - treated and untreated areas of the different substrates , and normalised to the number of cells present on the corresponding areas , determined by the CellTag stain signal . Data was represented as protein expression relative to the average expression of untreated ( control ) areas of the gels , or ratio of CK15 / CK3 expression from cells on the different substrates . Experiments were performed three independent times ( n = 3 ) using cells from different donors . Enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay . Collagen gels treated with collagenase ( treated ) or PBS ( control ) for 60min were laminin - coated , seeded with 3×10 5 LESCs , and incubated in CnT - 7 medium at 37°C for 3 days . Subsequently , culture supernatants were collected on ice , centrifuged at 10 , 000× g for 10min at 4°C , sampled , and analysed for human IL - 6 expression using the Quantikine enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kit ( R & D Systems ) according to the manu - facturer ’ s instructions . The expression of IL - 6 was then normalised for the amount of total protein present in the supernatants , and expressed as pgmL − 1 µg − 1 of total protein . Both conditions were assayed three independent times ( n = 3 ) . Quantitative RT - PCR analysis . Collagen gels treated with collagenase ( treated ) or PBS ( control ) for 60min were laminin - coated , seeded with 3× 10 5 LESCs , and incubated in CnT - 7 medium at 37°C for up to 1 week . Cells were then harvested using a ﬂ exible cell scraper ( Sarstedt , Germany ) , and their mRNA isolated using standard extraction with Trizol ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) . The assessment of mRNA quality was performed using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer ( Thermo Sci - enti ﬁ c ) to ensure the 260 / 280 ratio was within the 1 . 8 – 2 . 0 range . Synthesis of cDNA from isolated total mRNA was done using the RT2 First Strand kit ( Qiagen , Germany ) according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol , in a TcPlus thermocycler ( Techne , UK ) . The polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) was carried out using the default thermal pro ﬁ le of the Eco Real - Time System ( Illumina , CA , USA ) , with the following 40 ×three - step cycle : 10 - s denaturation , 95 °C ; 30 - s annealing , 60°C ; and 15 - s elongation , 72°C . The transcription levels of DEFB4 and KRT3 ( differentiation markers ) , ABCG2 , NP63 , KRT14 , and NANOG ( limbal markers ) , and VEGF , IL1A , IL1B , and IL6 ( pro - in ﬂ ammatory markers ) using speci ﬁ c primers ( Supplementary Table 4 ) were calculated by the comparative threshold cycle ( CT ) ( Eco Software v3 . 1 ; Illumina ) , and normalised to the expression of the POLR2A housekeeping gene . Data was represented as gene expression relative to that of LESCs grown on stiffer ( control ) gels , from three independent experiments ( n = 3 ) , each using cells from independent donors . Collagenase treatment of rabbit corneas in vivo . Animal experiments were performed following the appropriate guidelines and after ethical approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Harry S . Truman Memorial Veterans ’ Hospital and the University of Missouri , Columbia , USA . To test the effect of collagenase on the central cornea , 2 – 3 - month - old New Zealand White female rabbits ( Covance Research Products ) weighing 2 . 5 – 3 . 0kg were anesthetised and divided into two groups : one with six animals subjected to collagenase treat - ment in their intact ( right eye ) and debrided ( left - eye ) corneas , previously marked in the central region using an 8 mm ⌀ trephine and debrided of the epithelium ; and a second group of six animals subjected to mock - treatment . The effect of col - lagenase on chemically burned limbus tissue was tested using the right eyes of six rabbits subjected to the localised application of 0 . 5M NaOH for 25s ( alkali burn ) in the temporal side of the limbus , with a sub - group of three animals subsequently receiving collagenase treatment on the burned limbus ( treated ) ( see Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . The corneas from contralateral eyes were used as mock controls . The softening treatment was performed based on the collagenase activity optimised previously in vitro and ex vivo , as it was shown appropriate to produce tissues with limbus - like mechanical properties . Brie ﬂ y , collagenase was dissolved in 100 µL of pre - warmed 1 : 19 Dextran – PBS sterile solution ( 0 . 2gL − 1 ; 4×10 4 activity unitsL − 1 ) , soaked into an Ultracell Corneal Light Shield PVA sponge ( Beaver - Visitec , MA , USA ) , and then applied to the central or limbus region of the cornea for 15min ( 2 units cm − 2 h − 1 of total collagenase activity ) . Mock - treatments were performed by applying Dextran – PBS - soaked sponges to the cornea . Corneas were then washed thoroughly by excess saline and evaluated 1 and 5 days ( central cornea softening assay ) or 0 , 2 , and 7 days ( alkali - burned limbus assay ) post - intervention by IOP measurements , unbiased clinical eye examination , and stereo microscopy and slit lamp microscopy . For the central cornea softening assay , six rabbits ( three col - lagenase - treated , three control animals ) were sacri ﬁ ced at each time point after examination , whereas alkali - burned limbus assay animals were sacri ﬁ ced at day 7 , with whole corneas excised , embedded in optical cutting temperature ( OCT ) medium , and stored at − 80°C until processed for analysis . Statistical analysis . In all experiments , error bars represent the standard deviation ( S . D . ) of the mean , analysed a priori for homogeneity of variance . Replicates from each independent experiment were con ﬁ rmed to follow a Gaussian distribution , and differences between groups were determined using one - way or two - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by Bonferroni ’ s multiple comparison post hoc test . Signi ﬁ cance between groups was established for p < 0 . 05 , p < 0 . 01 , and p < 0 . 001 , and with a 95 % con ﬁ dence interval .

D . Brillouin frequency shift was calculated using 100 points from discrete areas of the corneal tissue ( epithelium , sub - epithelial lamina , anterior stroma , sub - limbal conjunctiva ) from three independent donors ( n = 3 ) , and represented as a scatter plot to illustrate intra - tissue variations . The average ± S . D . frequency distribution of elastic modulus of both treated and untreated gels was tested for correlation , and ﬁ t to Gaussian curves using a non - linear least - squares regression model , which were then analysed for independence using the Chi - square test .
