Vertical lines indicate the time of the shock . Supplementary note 1 : Cell volume increment To estimate cell volume in MCS , we measured MCS area from the white light images taken with the BLS microscope during the shocks . From this area we determine the volume , V , assuming that the MCS is a sphere . We plot in Fig . S1a the normalized MCS volume variation ∆ V MCS / V MCS at times 60 and 90 min after shock with 6kDa Dx . We see that it increases with Dx concentration , but remains constant over time , demonstrating the stability of the volume after the shock . To conﬁrm this observation , we plot the volume variation in single cells and in MCS over time see ∗ thomas . dehoux @ univ - lyon1 . fr 2 Fig . S2 ) . We see that in both cases the volume decreases rapidly and remains constant . This data demonstrate that single cells or aggregates reach a steady - state volume after Dx - generated osmotic pressure is applied . We then assume that the totality of MCS volume variation originates from cell volume vari - ation , as is the case with small Dx molecules : we can thus extract cell volume as ∆ V c / V c = ∆ V MCS / φ V MCS , where φ = 0 . 9 is the cell volume fraction . We plot ∆ V c / V c obtained from MCS volume ( red circles ) in Fig . S1b , and compare it to single cell volume ( blue markers ) . We see that both approaches give similar results . The linear ﬁts allow determining the γ coefﬁcient in each case . Supplementary note 2 : Mixing law We describe the physical properties of the multicellular tumor spheroid ( MCS ) , refractive index n , density ρ and elastic modulus M , using a mixing law [ 1 – 4 ] : n t = ( 1 − φ ) n i + φ n c , ( S2 . 1 ) ρ t = ( 1 − φ ) ρ i + φρ c , ( S2 . 2 ) 1 M t = 1 − φ M i + φ M c , ( S2 . 3 ) where φ is the volume fraction of cells of in the MCS . The subscripts ‘ t ’ , ‘ i ’ and ‘ c ’ of each parameter stand for ‘total equivalent’ , ‘inter - cellular’ and ‘intra - cellular’ , respectively . We have also the relation M = ρ u 2 [ 5 , 6 ] , with u the acoustic velocity . Equation ( S2 . 3 ) can then be rewritten as : 1 ρ t u 2 t = 1 − φ ρ i u 2 i + φ ρ c u 2 c . ( S2 . 4 ) We remind the formula of Brillouin frequency shift : [ 1 , 5 – 7 ] : ν = 2 n t λ s M t ρ t = 2 n t u t λ . ( S2 . 5 ) The Brillouin frequency shift for the MCS after the osmotic shocks can then be predicted by using Eq . ( S2 . 5 ) . In the following we calculate ν as a function of the concentration of the added Dextran solution , c d . We start in the next section by discussing the relationship between the ratio of the inter - to intra - cellular concentrations ( c i / c c ) and c d . 3 Supplementary note 3 : Inter - / intra - cellular concentration vs c d 3 . 1 . Inter - cellular concentration c i For the inter - cellular concentration c i , we consider that the 6 kDa Dextran penetrates into the MCS . The initial ICS is assumed to behave as isotonic water before the shock , and is replaced by Dx after the shock so that c i = c d . [ 8 ] 3 . 2 . Intra - cellular concentration c c For the intra - cellular concentration c c , we start with the deﬁnition of the concentration of solu - tions : c c = m s m c , ( S3 . 1 ) where m c = m s + m w is the total mass of the total mixture ( i . e . the cell ) , m s is the mass of the solute and m w is the mass of the solvent ( i . e . water ) . We then express the intra - cellular concentration as a function of the variation of the total mass , ∆ m c , after the osmotic shocks : c c = m s m c + ∆ m c = c 0 c 1 + ∆ m c m c , ( S3 . 2 ) with c 0 c the initial concentration in the cells before . Assuming that only the solvent is ﬂowing out of the cell ( i . e . a constant dry mass m s ) , we then have ∆ m c m c = − ∆ V c V c , ( S3 . 3 ) with V c the volume of a single cell and ∆ V c the variation of volume that we measured . We observed a linear relationship between the Dextran concentarion ( c d ) and the variation of the cell volume : c d = γδ V c . ( S3 . 4 ) with δ V c = ∆ V c / V c ( unit of [ % ] ) . Coefﬁcient γ is estimated from linear ﬁt to the data . Using the relationship between cell volume and Dx concentration , we plot the δ V c vs c d curve in Fig . S3 . We observe largely linear increase that we ﬁt to a line . Thus , c c could be expressed as a function of c d c c = c 0 c / ( 1 − c d / γ ) , ( S3 . 5 ) 4 c d ( wt % ) 0 5 10 15 δ V c ( % ) 0 5 10 15 20 25 Data Fitting FIG . S3 .

We use the initial cell concentration c 0 c = 10 wt % measured in a similar cell line , [ 9 ] also consistent with other measurements . [ 10 , 11 ] For illustration , the evolutions of c i and c c as a function of c d , calculated by using Eq . ( S3 . 5 ) and c i = c d , are shown in Fig . S4 .

S5 . Evolutions of inter - / intra - cellular and total optical index as a function of osmolyte concentration ( c d ) . Supplementary note 4 : Refractive index vs c d We consider the empirical relation between the variations of refractive index and of the solute concentrations : ∆ n = α ∆ c , ( S4 . 1 ) where α = 0 . 0019 is the proportionality factor taken from Ref . 12 . The inter - and intra - cellular refractive indices are written as : n i = n w + α i c i , ( S4 . 2 ) n c = n w + α c c c , ( S4 . 3 ) where n w = 1 . 332 is the refractive index of water [ 13 ] at 37 ◦ C . Since α is largely independent of the type of molecule , [ 12 , 14 ] we take α i = α c = α . With the help of Eq . ( S3 . 5 ) , and after taking Eq . ( S4 . 2 ) and Eq . ( S4 . 3 ) into Eq . ( S2 . 1 ) , we can calculate the evolutions of n i , n c and n t as a function c d ( see Fig . S5 ) . 6 Supplementary note 5 : Mass density vs c d 5 . 1 . Inter - cellular mass density ρ i We have the equation for inter - cellular mass density : ρ i = ρ w + ξ i c i , ( S5 . 1 ) where ρ w = 1 g / cm 3 is the density of pure water . ξ = 0 . 00375 g / cm 3 is estimated by ﬁtting the measured Dextran mass density found in Ref . 15 vs concentration , as shown in Fig .

Intra - cellular mass density ρ c For the intra - cellular density ρ c , we suppose that the cellular volume , V c , is equal to the volume of solvent ( i . e . water ) , V w , and we can calculate ρ c by using the deﬁnition of mass density : ρ c = m c V c = m c V w = m c m w / ρ w = ρ w m c m c − m s = ρ w (cid:18) 1 1 − c c (cid:19) . ( S5 . 2 ) Combining Eqs . ( S5 . 1 ) , ( S5 . 2 ) and ( S2 . 2 ) , we obtain the relations for ρ i , ρ c and ρ t vs c d . For illustration , the calculated evolutions of ρ i , ρ c and ρ t as a function c d are shown in Fig .

The inter - and intra - cellular acoustic velocity are written as : u i = u w + β i c i , ( S6 . 2 ) u c = u w + β c c c , ( S6 . 3 ) with u w = 1524 m / s the velocity of pure water at 37 ◦ C [ 18 ] . β i = 3 . 3 m / s is the proportionality factor of Dextran solutions estimated by ﬁtting our BLS data ( see Fig .

As a comparison , we plot acoustic velocities and corresponding β - values for sev - eral materials : Bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) solution ( our BLS data ) , HCT - 116 cells ( our data obtained on MCS ) , Dextran solution ( our data ) , NaCl [ 16 ] , sucrose [ 17 ] and pure water [ 18 ] . 6 . 2 . Determination of velocity increment in cells , β 0 c We ﬁrst calculate u expc from our data before osmotic shocks by using Eq . ( S2 . 4 ) : u exp c = vuut φ ρ c u 2 t ρ t − ρ c ( 1 − φ ) u 2 i ρ i . ( S6 . 4 ) We obtain u expc = 1594 m / s , a value similar to that measured on MCF7 cells by acoustic microscopy . [ 20 ] Using Eq . ( S6 . 3 ) , we calculate the value of acoustic velocity as a function of β c , u num c : u num c ( β c ) = u w + β c c 0 c . ( S6 . 5 ) We then minimize the cost function : f cost ( β c ) = k u num c ( β c ) − u exp c k . ( S6 . 6 ) The result of the cost function is shown in Fig . S10 , leading to β 0 c = 6 . 9 m / s . Utilizing Eqs . ( S6 . 2 ) , ( S6 . 3 ) and ( S2 . 4 ) , the evolutions of u i , u c and u t , as is shown in Fig .
