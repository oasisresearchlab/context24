Amongst the recently discovered synaptic proteins is p140Cap , an adaptor that localizes at dendritic spines and regulates their maturation and physiology . We recently showed that p140Cap knockout mice have cognitive deﬁcits , impaired long - term potentiation ( LTP ) and long - term depression ( LTD ) , and immature , ﬁlopodia - like dendritic spines . Only a few p140Cap interacting proteins have been identiﬁed in the brain and the molecular complexes and pathways underlying p140Cap synaptic function are largely unknown . Here , we isolated and characterized the p140Cap synaptic interactome by co - immunoprecipitation from crude mouse synaptosomes , followed by mass spectrometry - based proteomics . We identiﬁed 351 p140Cap interactors and found that they cluster to sub complexes mostly located in the postsynaptic density ( PSD ) . p140Cap interactors converge on key synaptic processes , including transmission across chemical synapses , actin cytoskeleton remodeling and cell - cell junction organization . Gene co - expression data further support convergent functions : the p140Cap interactors are tightly co - expressed with each other and with p140Cap . Importantly , the p140Cap interactome and its co - expression network show strong enrichment in genes associated with schizophrenia , autism , bipolar disorder , intellectual disability and epilepsy , supporting Alﬁeri et al . p140Cap as a Hub for Proteins Involved in Synaptopathies synaptic dysfunction as a shared biological feature in brain diseases . Overall , our data provide novel insights into the molecular organization of the synapse and indicate that p140Cap acts as a hub for postsynaptic complexes relevant to psychiatric and neurological disorders . Keywords : p140Cap , postsynaptic density , synaptic transmission , synaptic plasticity , schizophrenia , autism , intellectual disability , epilepsy INTRODUCTION Mutations in genes encoding synaptic proteins have been associated with several brain disorders , including schizophrenia , autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) and developmental delay / intellectual disability ( DD / ID ) ( De Rubeis et al . , 2014 ; Fromer et al . , 2014 ; Deciphering Developmental Disorders , 2015 ) . The term “synaptopathies” has in fact been proposed to cover a broad range of clinical manifestations having synaptic dysfunction as common etiology ( Grant , 2012 ) . The synaptic genes implicated in brain diseases span several functional classes , including adhesion molecules ( e . g . , NRXN1 ; Kim et al . , 2008 ) , neurotransmitter receptors ( e . g . , GRIN2B ; Endele et al . , 2010 ) , voltage - gated ion channels ( e . g . , SCN2A ; Rauch et al . , 2012 ) , scaﬀolding proteins of the postsynaptic density ( PSD ) ( e . g . , SHANK3 ; Betancur and Buxbaum , 2013 ) and signaling proteins ( e . g . , SYNGAP1 ; Hamdan et al . , 2009 ) . Enormous progress has been made in the characterization of the synaptic proteome ( Bayes et al . , 2014 ) , and the molecular and functional dissection of speciﬁc subsynaptic complexes is likely to reveal novel genes relevant to brain pathophysiology . Amongst the recently discovered synaptic proteins is p140Cap / SNIP ( Chin et al . , 2000 ; Di Stefano et al . , 2004 ) , a scaﬀolding protein localized in dendritic spines ( Jaworski et al . , 2009 ) and encoded by the SRCIN1 gene . Previous work from our laboratory and others indicates that p140Cap is key in regulating synaptogenesis , synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity ( Jaworski et al . , 2009 ; Tomasoni et al . , 2013 ; Repetto et al . , 2014 ) . Acute down - regulation of p140Cap in primary hippocampal neurons reduces the number of mushroom spines and proportionally increases the number of dendritic ﬁlopodia ( Jaworski et al . , 2009 ; Tomasoni et al . , 2013 ) , a defect in synaptic maturation that can also be observed in p140Cap knockout ( KO ) mice ( Repetto et al . , 2014 ) . Notably , dendritic spine dysgenesis is a consistent neuroanatomical ﬁnding in several psychiatric disorders , including ID , ASD and schizophrenia ( Penzes et al . , 2011 ) . Further , p140Cap KO mice display defective long - term potentiation ( LTP ) and reduced long - term depression ( LTD ) , two forms of synaptic plasticity necessary for learning and memory . Consistently , p140Cap KO mice show impairments in object recognition , suggestive of defects in memory consolidation and retrieval cognitive defects ( Repetto et al . , 2014 ) . The molecular complexes and pathways underlying p140Cap function are largely unknown . p140Cap was originally identiﬁed as an interactor of SNAP - 25 in a two - hybrid screen ( Chin et al . , 2000 ) and subsequent studies have shown that this interaction takes place in the PSD , involving also PSD95 , and is required for spine morphogenesis ( Tomasoni et al . , 2013 ; Fossati et al . , 2015 ) . p140Cap had been also shown to interact with other components of the pre - synaptic compartment , such as vinexin and synaptophysin ( Ito et al . , 2008 ) . Other interactions necessary for p140Cap - mediated control of spine formation and / or maturation are those with the EB3 ( Jaworski et al . , 2009 ) , Endophilin A1 ( Yang et al . , 2015 ) , and Src kinase ( Di Stefano et al . , 2007 ; Repetto et al . , 2013 , 2014 ) . EB3 binds the plus - end of growing microtubules that can enter dendritic spines and inﬂuence their morphology ( Jaworski et al . , 2009 ) . Endophilin A1 is localized both presynaptically , where it regulates synaptic vesicle endocytosis , and postsynaptically , where it controls spine morphogenesis ( Yang et al . , 2015 ) . The correct functioning of both EB3 and Endophilin A1 requires p140Cap and its downstream eﬀector cortactin , an F - actin - binding protein , that regulates the actin cytoskeleton organization ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ) . The p140Cap - dependent regulation of cortactin activity might require a direct interaction as well as the suppression of the Src kinase pathway . In fact , cortactin is inhibited by Src phosphorylation ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) , and p140Cap directly binds Src ( Di Stefano et al . , 2007 ) and suppresses its activation through binding to the C - terminal Src kinase ( Csk ) ( Di Stefano et al . , 2007 ; Repetto et al . , 2013 ) . Consistently , synapses isolated from p140Cap KO mice have increased phosphorylation on Src kinase Tyrosine 416 ( Repetto et al . , 2014 ) and treatment with a speciﬁc Src inhibitor ameliorates the spine defects observed in p140Cap KO neurons ( Repetto et al . , 2014 ) . Beyond its role in spine morphology , p140Cap - mediated suppression of Src has been recently implicated in the homeostatic brake that restrains cocaine reward in the nucleus accumbens ( Damez - Werno et al . , 2016 ) . Given the role of p140Cap in synaptogenesis and the repercussions on cognition in its absence , we sought to capture the p140Cap molecular complexes at synapses and investigate their relevance for brain disorders . By using biochemical , proteomic , gene co - expression , and genetic data , we provide a comprehensive analysis of the p140Cap synaptic interactome . Our results reveal that p140Cap acts as a hub for synaptic proteins implicated in psychiatric and neurological disorders . MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Mixed 129Sv × C57BL / 6J p140Cap heterozygous mice were generated as described in ( Repetto et al . , 2014 ) .

L . n ◦ 116 , 27 / 1 / 1992 in relation to animal use and protection in scientiﬁc research . ” Male , 3 - month old wild - type ( WT ) and Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 2 June 2017 | Volume 10 | Article 212 Alﬁeri et al . p140Cap as a Hub for Proteins Involved in Synaptopathies p140Cap knockout ( KO ) littermates were used for synaptosomes preparations . Animals were sacriﬁced by cervical dislocation . Synaptosomes Preparation Synaptosomes were prepared from the telencephalon . The tissue was homogenized with a Dounce glass homogenizer and glass pestle in 8 ml ice - cold synaptosome buﬀer ( 4 mM Hepes pH = 7 . 3 , 320 mM sucrose , 1 mM EGTA , Roche protease inhibitors 25X , 1 mM Sodium Orthovanadate , 1 mM DTT , phenylmethylsulphonyl ﬂuoride , 1 mM sodium ﬂuoride ) . The homogenate was centrifuged at 1 , 000 g for 10 min at 4 ◦ C . After discarding the nuclear pellet , the supernatant was centrifuged at 12 , 500 g for 20 min at 4 ◦ C . The pellet containing the synaptosomal fraction was resuspended in the synaptosome buﬀer and further centrifuged at 12 , 500 g for 20 min at 4 ◦ C . The ﬁnal pellet ( crude synaptosome fraction ) was resuspended in 2 ml of ice - cold lysis buﬀer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris pH = 7 , 5 % Glycerol , 1 % NP - 40 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , Roche protease inhibitors 25X , 1 mM Sodium Orthovanadate , 1 mM DTT , phenylmethylsulphonyl ﬂuoride , 1 mM sodium ﬂuoride ) and immediately processed for immunoprecipitation ( Figure S1 ) . Western Blot Western blots were performed with Mini - PROTEAN R (cid:13) TGX TM Precast Gels from Bio - Rad ( California 94547 USA ) . gradient 4 – 15 % Gels were transferred on Nitrocellulose blotting membrane ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) using Towbin buﬀer ( 25 mM Tris , 192 mM Glycine , 20 % Methanol ) . Membranes were blocked with Tris - buﬀered saline TBS ( 50 mM Tris p < h 7 – 150 mM NaCl ) with 5 % Milk for 1 h at room temperature , incubated with primary and secondary antibodies as indicated below , and then developed with Bio - Rad’s Clarity ECL on ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System ( Biorad ) . For western blot of crude synaptosomal proteins , 30 ug of proteins was used . Antibodies Speciﬁc mouse monoclonal antibody ( Mab ) against p140Cap ( clone 2A8 ) was produced at the MBC , University of Torino , as previously described ( Di Stefano et al . , 2007 ; Repetto et al . , 2013 ) .

Mouse and rabbit IgGs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology . Secondary antibodies anti - mouse and anti - rabbit were purchased from Sigma Aldrich . p140Cap Immunoprecipitation 1 . 25 mg of Dynabeads protein G ( 30 mg Dynabeads R (cid:13) / mL Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) were initially washed using a Sodium Acetate buﬀer ( 100 mM Sodium acetate pH = 5 , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 ) and incubated with 6 µ g of p140Cap antibody diluted in the same buﬀer for 1 h at room temperature under gentle rotation . Beads were then washed twice withSodium acetate buﬀer and with Sodium Borate buﬀer ( 0 . 2 M Sodium borate pH = 9 , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 ) Crosslinking was performed with 25 mM Dymethil Pimelimidate in 1 ml of Sodium Borate buﬀer for 45 min at room temperature on a wheel . Beads were washed again with Sodium Borate buﬀer and then with 0 . 2 M Ethanolamine pH = 8 , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 , incubated for 1 h at RT on a wheel to block the N - reactive groups and washed twice in PBS 0 . 1 % NP - 40 . To remove the non - cross - linked antibody , beads were suspended in 100 mM Glycine pH = 2 . 5 and rapidly washed in 50 mM Tris pH = 7 . 4 0 . 1 % NP - 40 . p140Cap - coupled Dynabeads were then washed twice with PBS 1X 0 . 05 % Tween and then incubated with 6 mg of crude synaptosomal extracted for 2 h at 4 ◦ C . Beads were washed ﬁve times with cold lysis buﬀer , then resuspended in 60 µ l of 2 % SDS - PAGE sample buﬀer in reducing conditions and incubated at 70 ◦ C for 10 min . From this 1 mg was tested for Coomassie staining , 1 mg for Western blot for p140Cap to control the quality of the samples and 4 mg was used for mass spectrometry ( Figure S2 ) . Primary Hippocampal Cultures Primary cultures were established from the hippocampus of 17 . 5 – 18 . 5 embryos derived from breeding of p140Cap ± mice . The dissociated cells were plated on 20 mm coverslip coated with poly - lysine at the density of 80 , 000 cells / coverslip and cultured in Neurobasal medium ( Invitrogen ) added with B27 ( Invitrogen ) , supplemented with antibiotics , 2 mM glutamine and glutamate for 17 – 18 days at 37 ◦ C . Neurons were then ﬁxed in paraformaldehyde 4 % and sucrose 4 % ( Sigma Aldrich ) for 8 min at room temperature . Immunoﬂuorescence and Microscopy Immunoﬂuorescence staining was performed using antibodies against PSD95 ( 1 : 500 mouse monoclonal Abcam ) and p140Cap homemade monoclonal antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 Antibody labeling kit ( Thermo Fisher ) diluted 1 : 500 . Coverslips were ﬁrst incubated with anti - PSD95 and then with Alexa ﬂuor 488 goat anti mouse ( Invitrogen ) ; after several washes of the secondary antibody , conjugated anti - p140Cap Mab was added for 1h at room temperature and then washed away . Images were acquired using a Leica SPE confocal microscope . Mass Spectrometry ( 1 ) Preparation and in - gel digestion of proteins : proteins from co - IP eluates were stacked in the top of a 4 – 12 % NuPAGE gel ( Invitrogen ) and stained with R - 250 Coomassie blue . Gel bands were manually excised and cut in pieces before being washed six times with 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 for 15 min , followed by six washes in 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 containing 50 % ( v / v ) acetonitrile . Gel pieces were then dehydrated with 100 % acetonitrile and incubated with 10 mM DTT in 25 mM Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 3 June 2017 | Volume 10 | Article 212 Alﬁeri et al . p140Cap as a Hub for Proteins Involved in Synaptopathies NH 4 HCO 3 for 45 min at 53 ◦ C and with 55 mM iodoacetamide in 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 for 35 min in the dark . Alkylation was stopped by adding 10 mM DTT in 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 ( incubation for 10 min ) . Gel pieces were then washed again by incubation in 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 followed by dehydration with 100 % acetonitrile . Modiﬁed trypsin ( Promega , sequencing grade ) in 25 mM NH 4 HCO 3 was added to the dehydrated gel pieces before overnight incubation at 37 ◦ C . Peptides were extracted from gel pieces in three sequential extraction steps ( each 15 min ) using 30 µ l of 50 % acetonitrile , 30 µ l of 5 % formic acid , and ﬁnally 30 µ l of 100 % acetonitrile . The pooled supernatants were dried under vacuum . ( 2 ) Nano - LC - MS / MS analyses : the dried extracted peptides were resuspended in 5 % acetonitrile and 0 . 1 % triﬂuoroacetic acid and analyzed by online nanoLC - MS / MS ( UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano and Q - Exactive Plus , Thermo Scientiﬁc ) with 2 replicates per sample . Peptides were sampled on a 300 µ m x 5 mm PepMap C18 precolumn and separated on a 75 µ m × 250 mm C18 column ( PepMap , Dionex ) . The nanoLC method consisted of a 120 - min gradient at a ﬂow rate of 300 nl / min , ranging from 5 to 37 % acetronitrile in 0 . 1 % formic acid for 114 min , before reaching 72 % acetronitrile in 0 . 1 % formic acid for the last 6 min . Spray voltage was set at 1 . 6 kV ; heated capillary was adjusted to 270 ◦ C . Survey full - scan MS spectra ( m / z = 400 – 1 , 600 ) were acquired with a resolution of 70 , 000 after accumulation of 10 6 ions ( maximum ﬁlling time 200 ms ) . The 10 most intense ions were fragmented by higher - energy collisional dissociation after accumulation of 10 5 ions ( maximum ﬁlling time 50 ms ) . MS and MS / MS data were acquired using the software Xcalibur ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . ( 3 ) Data analyses : RAW ﬁles were processed using MaxQuant , version 1 . 5 . 1 . 2 ( Cox and Mann , 2008 ) . Spectra were searched against the Uniprot database ( Mus musculus taxonomy , March 2015 version ) and the frequently observed contaminants database embedded in MaxQuant . The I = L option was activated . Trypsin was chosen as the enzyme and 2 missed cleavages were allowed . Peptide modiﬁcations allowed during the search were : carbamidomethylation ( C , ﬁxed ) , acetyl ( Protein N - ter , variable ) and oxidation ( M , variable ) . Minimum number of unique peptides was set to 1 . The matching between runs option was activated . The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDEpartner repository ( Vizcaino et al . , 2016 ) with the dataset identiﬁer PXD004215 . ( 4 ) Statistical analyses : The following steps were mainly performed using the Perseus toolbox ( version 1 . 5 . 1 . 6 ) available in the MaxQuant environment . Proteins identiﬁed in the reverse and contaminant databases , identiﬁed with less than 2 razor + unique peptides , or exhibiting less than 6 iBAQ values in one condition ( 3 biological replicates with 2 analytical replicates each for control and p140Cap co - IPs ) were discarded from the list . iBAQ values of the 1952 remaining proteins . After log2 transformation , iBAQ values were normalized by condition - wise centering , missing data imputation was realized ( replacing missing values by a constant weak value calculated independently for each injected sample as the 2 . 5 - percentile value of the column ) and statistical testing of diﬀerential abundances between control and p140Cap conditions were conducted using welch t - testing . To consider a protein as a potential binding partner of p140Cap , it must has passed our signiﬁcance criteria : FDR threshold of 1 % on p - values using the Benjamini - Hochberg method and a minimum 4 - times enrichment in p140Cap WT samples compared to the KO controls . Bioinformatic Analyses of MS Data Throughout the study , over - representation of annotation terms ( disease , function etc . ) was estimated by use of the hypergeometric distribution to test whether the number of selected proteins is larger than would be expected by chance ; p = 1 − k − 1 X i = 0 (cid:0) Mi (cid:1) (cid:16) N − M n − i (cid:17) (cid:0) Nn (cid:1) where N is a total number of proteins in the background distribution , M is the number of genes within distribution that are annotated to the node of interest , n is the size of the list of genes of interest and k is the number of genes within the list , which are annotated to the node . Obtained p - values were adjusted for multiple testing by Bonferroni correction at 0 . 05 or 0 . 01 signiﬁcance levels as indicated . For literature comparison , a list of 6 , 688 proteins was selected as a synaptic universe based on combined results from 35 published synapse proteome studies ( in preparation ; Supplementary Table S2 ) . Protein lists from those studies were curated , mapped to stable IDs ( Entrez , Uniprot , MGI ) for human and mouse and combined into single list containing only unique protein / gene name , IDs and publication source ( PMID ) . Summary data for the 35 publications with associated metadata ( PMID , year , method , species and number of proteins found ) are presented in Supplementary Table S2 ) . Enrichment analysis of annotation in the interactome was performed in R , speciﬁcally using the Bioconductor package ClusterProﬁler for Gene Ontology ( GO ) and KEGG enrichment analysis ( Yu et al . , 2012 ) and Bioconductor ReactomePA package for pathway over - representation analysis ( http : / / bioconductor . org / packages / release / bioc / html / ReactomePA . html ) . For each enrichment type ( GO , KEGG , Reactome ) , two background sets of proteins were used : ( 1 ) the default mouse genome list from Bioconductor and ( 2 ) our list of 6688 published synaptic proteins - to reveal the consistency in enriched terms . p - values , adjusted for multiple comparison p . adjust and q - values for false discovery rates ( FDR ) are provided in Supplementary Table S3 . For disease enrichment the annotation data were standardized using MetaMap ( Aronson and Lang , 2010 ) and NCBO Annotator ( Whetzel et al . , 2011 ; Musen et al . , 2012 ) to recognize terms found in the Human Disease Ontology ( HDO ) ( Schriml et al . , 2012 ) Recognized enriched disease ontology terms were then associated with gene identiﬁers and stored locally . Disease term enrichment’ , for the p140Cap dataset’ , could then be calculated using the Topology - based Elimination Fisher method ( Alexa et al . , 2006 ) found in the topGO package ( http : / / topgo . bioinf - mpi - inf . mpg . de / ) , together with the standardized OMIM and Ensembl variation gene - disease annotation data ( 14111 gene - disease associations ) , mapped onto the full HDO tree . Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 4 June 2017 | Volume 10 | Article 212 Alﬁeri et al . p140Cap as a Hub for Proteins Involved in Synaptopathies A PSD network was constructed from a list of 1 , 443 proteins obtained from a study of the PSD in the human brain ( Bayes et al . , 2011 ) . Protein - protein interactions were obtained by mining publicly available databases : HIPPIE ( Schaefer et al . , 2012 ) , BioGRID ( Chatr - Aryamontri et al . , 2015 ) , IntAct ( Kerrien et al . , 2012 ) , and performing an InterologWalk over diﬀerent species using Bio : : Homology : : InterologWalk ( Gallone et al . , 2011 ) . The connected PSD network consists of 1 , 312 proteins and 8 , 031 protein interactions ( i . e . , 131 proteins could not be connected into the network ) . This PSD network was clustered making use of the spectral properties of the network ; the network being expressed in terms of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues , and partitioned recursively ( using a ﬁne - tuning step ) into communities based on maximizing the Modularity clustering measure ( Newman , 2006 ; Simpson et al . , 2010 ) . Where ﬁrst we found the node which , when moved from one community to the other , gave the maximum change in Modularity . This node’s community was then ﬁxed and we repeat the process until all nodes had been moved . The whole process was repeated from this new state until the change in the Modularity , between the new and old state , was less than the predeﬁned tolerance . The modularity of the full PSD network was found to be 0 . 36 . Robustness of the full PSD network communities was assessed by running the algorithm 500 times , randomly selecting 80 % of the network node set and related interactions each time . The package clusterCons ( Simpson et al . , 2010 ) was used to build a consensus matrix from which to test the robustness of the communities , and proteins found inside the communities . Community and protein robustness values range from 0 , indicating no conﬁdence in existing through to 1 , indicating absolute conﬁdence in the cluster existing . Community robustness values range from 0 . 1 to 0 . 7 , and from 0 . 01 to 0 . 9 for protein robustness . Clusters C7 , C17 , C22 , and C23 showed evidence of being robust , with community robustness values 0 . 2 , 0 . 4 , 0 . 3 , and 0 . 3 respectively . We also tested the signiﬁcance of annotation enrichment in each cluster using the Hypergeometric distribution formula . P ≤ 10 − 2 , were tested for their strength of signiﬁcance by recording the percentage of P - values found from every community / annotation combination , lower than or equal to the observed P - value , when 1 , 000 random permutations of the annotation labels were made . P - values found with a strength of signiﬁcance < 1 % were considered statistically signiﬁcant . P - values values were also tested against a more stringent Bonferroni correction at the 0 . 05 ( ∗ ) , 0 . 01 ( ∗∗ ) , and 0 . 001 ( ∗∗∗ ) signiﬁcant levels , and highlighted throughout the enrichment tables . Gene Co - expression Analysis Gene co - expression was evaluated on 18 human - mouse conserved co - expression networks ( CCNs ) ( Piro et al . , 2011 ) , where a link of co - expression reﬂects the human and mouse independent gene co - expression in the corresponding single - species networks . Statistical signiﬁcance of p140Cap interactors co - expressed with p140Cap was assessed by hypergeometric distribution . Statistical signiﬁcance of the co - expression between p140Cap interactors was assessed by evaluating the p - value of the z - score corresponding to the number of links found in the single CCNs , based on 100 randomization of the same CCNs . RESULTS Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of p140Cap Synaptic Interactome To identify the p140Cap protein complexes and the related functional pathways at synapses , we performed a quantitative proteomic analysis of p140Cap immunoprecipitates from mouse crude synaptosomes preparations , using p140Cap KO mice ( Repetto et al . , 2014 ) as negative control ( Figure S1 ) . The quality of the preparations was veriﬁed by testing the enrichment of synaptic proteins in the crude synaptosome fraction compared to total brain extracts . PSD - 95 , SNAP - 25 , and Bassoon , as well as p140Cap , were enriched in synaptosomes ( Figure 1A ) . Three distinct crude synaptosomes were prepared from 3 month - old WT and p140Cap KO male mice and synaptosomal extracts were immunoprecipitated using p140Cap monoclonal antibody . The speciﬁcity of the immunoprecipitates ( IP ) was conﬁrmed by Coomassie staining and western blot ( Figure S2 ) . In the Coomassie - stained gel , we detected a discrete band of ∼ 150 kDa , corresponding to the expected molecular weight for p140Cap in SDS - PAGE in the IPs from WT samples but not from p140Cap KO synaptosomes ( Figure S2A ) . Similarly , a p140Cap immunoreactive band was observed in the p140Cap IPs from WT but not from KO synaptosomes ( Figure S2B ) . The Coomassie - stained gel reveals that several proteins seem to selectively co - immunoprecipitate with p140Cap from WT samples as compared with the KO ones . Overall , these data indicate that the p140Cap immunoprecipitation is highly speciﬁc , thus making these samples suitable for the identiﬁcation of p140Cap interactors by mass spectrometry ( MS ) . To identify p140Cap - binding partners , we applied label - free quantitative MS - based proteomics to the p140Cap IPs from WT and KO synaptosomes . Proteins eluted from the IPs were in - gel digested and the resulting peptides analyzed by nanoliquid chromatography coupled to tandem MS ( two analytical replicates per sample ) . Identities and intensities of the recovered peptides and proteins in each sample were obtained using MaxQuant ( Cox and Mann , 2008 ) . After ﬁltering and statistical analysis of iBAQ values ( Schwanhausser et al . , 2011 ) , 352 ( 351 interactors plus p140Cap ) proteins enriched in the WT samples were identiﬁed ( Supplementary Table S1 ) , as represented in the Volcano plot ( Figure 1B ) . To validate the proteomic ﬁndings , we selected eleven candidates whose alterations might underlie the dendritic spine defects , the impairments in LTP / LTD , and the learning and memory deﬁcits we previously observed in the p140Cap KO mice ( Repetto et al . , 2014 ) . We then tested the presence of the selected proteins on the p140Cap IPs . We tested and validated p140Cap interactions with Citron - N , already known to interact with p140Cap ( Repetto et al . , 2014 ) ; the NMDA receptor subunits Grin2a , Grin2b and Grin1 , the scaﬀold proteins Dlg4 / PSD95 , Shank2 , Shank3 , Homer1 , and Camk2a .

Further , we validated the interaction with the adhesion molecules Cadherin - 11 ( Cdh11 ) ( Manabe et al . , 2000 ) and Cadm1 / Syncam ( Frei and Stoeckli , 2016 ; Figure 1C ) . We also veriﬁed that three proteins ( Ttc3 , Trio , and Gfap ) , placed very low in the interactome , were only non speciﬁcally immunoprecipitated with anti p140Cap Mab ( Figure S3 ) . Further , we performed a reverse validation : we immunoprecipitated PSD95 and Grin2a and veriﬁed the presence of p140Cap ( Figure 1D ) . The validation of the proteomic data across a range of various enrichment levels above the ﬁxed cut - oﬀ indicates that the p140Cap synaptic interactome we isolated contains bona ﬁne p140Cap - containing macromolecular complexes . Synaptic Localisation of p140CAP Complexes with Comparative Study of Reported Synaptic Datasets To further map the p140Cap interactome , we searched published neuronal proteome datasets for p140Cap and its interactors . We found that p140Cap was reported in the majority of the Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 6 June 2017 | Volume 10 | Article 212 Alﬁeri et al . p140Cap as a Hub for Proteins Involved in Synaptopathies published PSD datasets ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . In a few co - IP studies , p140Cap was detected in complexes with PSD95 ( Dosemeci et al . , 2007 ) , mGluR5 ( Farr et al . , 2004 ) , Chmpb2 ( Chassefeyre et al . , 2018 ) , and Snap25 ( Fossati et al . , 2015 ) . Further , we searched for the 351 identiﬁed interactors of p140Cap across the published PSD proteomic datasets and found an exceptionally high enrichment ( order of E - 14 of signiﬁcance in average ) ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . We also sought to verify whether p140Cap and associated proteins were found in presynaptic preparations as well , and we found that p140Cap was detected in the presynaptic compartment in several studies ( Gronborg et al . , 2010 ; Boyken et al . , 2013 ; Weingarten et al . , 2014 ) . Speciﬁcally , it was detected in complexes with Rims1 , Syn1 - 2 - 3 , Git1 , and Wasf1 in co - IP experiments on presynaptic protein complexes ( August B Smit , personal communication ) . However , it was not reported in other studies focusing on synaptic vesicles ( SV ) or SV - recycling proteins ( Morciano et al . , 2005 , 2009 ; Gorini et al . , 2010 ; Brinkmalm et al . , 2014 ; Wilhelm et al . , 2014 ) . p140Cap – interacting proteins , in turn , were found enriched in presynaptic datasets , although with a lower score than that found in postsynaptic studies ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . Therefore , our proteomic data , in agreement with previous studies , place p140Cap mainly , but not exclusively , in the PSD . We then examined all the p140 - interacting proteins to evaluate their distribution between pre - and postsynaptic complexes . The two lists showed a high degree of overlap , which was expected since the majority of synaptic proteins are found in both compartments . Figure 2A shows the distribution of the p140 - interacting proteins between PSD ( 5023 proteins from 25 postsynaptic studies and presynaptic compartment ( 1215 proteins from 9 presynaptic studies ) . 334 of the 352 p140Cap interactors overlap with these datasets . Of these proteins , none were described as speciﬁcally presynaptic , whereas the majority was described as speciﬁcally postsynaptic ( 247 ) or found in both compartments ( 87 ) . This further supports a predominantly postsynaptic localization of the p140Cap complexes . The presence of p140Cap in the PSD has been previously shown in rat synaptic fractionation , where it is enriched in the PSD fraction together with PSD95 ( Mclean Colin et al . , 2016 ) . To further validate the presence of p140Cap in the PSD , we performed a localization experiment on primary mouse hippocampal cultures . Staining of both p140Cap and PSD95 in Figure 2B shows a co - localization of these two proteins at synapses . All together , these results strongly indicate that the p140Cap - associated proteins share common cellular functions and fall within speciﬁc substructures of the PSD . Functional Enrichment Analyses of the p140CAP - Containing Protein Complexes To obtain a functional perspective of the p140Cap interactome , we tested its enrichment against KEGG , GO ontology and Reactome databases ( Supplementary Table S3 ) . We ran analysis against two reference ( background ) lists : ( 1 ) the default mouse genome list provided by Bioconductor and ( 2 ) a combined list of 6688 proteins from published synapse proteomics studies , to reveal more speciﬁc p140Cap associated terms compared to the whole synaptosome . Both reference lists demonstrated a very high level of consistency in top enriched terms . However , using the synaptic as background gives more conservative ( i . e . , lower ) signiﬁcance values for enriched terms . The full lists for enrichment results are presented in Supplementary Table 3 . For the enriched terms listed here , p - values were corrected for multiple testing as described in the methods . Based on Molecular Function ( MF ) ontology , the 351 p140Cap - interacting proteins were signiﬁcantly enriched for the “actin binding” term ( P = 2 . 79E - 17 ) , which is in line with the previously described functions of p140Cap ( Repetto et al . , 2014 ) . Additionally , we found that “glutamate receptor binding” ( P = 3 . 46E - 11 ) , “PDZ domain binding” ( P = 1 . 22E - 06 ) and “GTPase regulator activity” ( P = 2 . 86E - 04 ) terms were also signiﬁcantly increased ( Supplementary Table S3 ) . Among the top Cellular Compartment ( CC ) terms were “postsynaptic membrane” ( P = 3 . 08E - 27 ) , “actin cytoskeleton” ( P = 2 . 87E - 14 ) , and “neurotransmitter receptor complex” ( P = 8 . 53E - 10 ) . This is in agreement with Biological Process ( BP ) GO results , where the top enriched terms were “chemical synaptic transmission” ( P = 1 . 81E - 15 ) , “actin cytoskeleton organization” ( P = 4 . 37E - 11 ) , “regulation of synaptic plasticity” ( P = 1 . 96E - 09 ) and “regulation of protein complex assembly” ( P = 3 . 63E - 06 ) ( Supplementary Table S3 ) . Analysis of enrichment against the Reactome pathway database revealed the overrepresentation for “Transmission across Chemical Synapses” ( P = 7 . 05E - 15 ) , “Unblocking of NMDA receptor , glutamate binding and activation” ( P = 4 . 90E - 10 ) , “Cell - cell junction organization” ( P = 1 . 44E - 08 ) , “Ras activation upon Ca inﬂux through NMDA receptor” ( P = 2 . 49E - 08 ) , “L1CAM interactions” ( P = 1 . 00E - 07 ) ( Supplementary Table S3 ) . To classify proteins into functionally related modules , we checked for the correlation between the experimentally measured protein abundances and Reactome pathway terms for the top 174 interacting proteins with the highest signiﬁcance . Three “modules” could be detected ( Figure 3 ) . Module 1 ( Figure 3 , upper right ) is related to “Unblocking and activating NMDA receptors , ” “Traﬃcking of AMPA receptors” and “Chemical signaling through the synapse” Reactome terms ( including Gria1 , Gria3 , Grin2B , and Dlg4 ) . Module 2 ( Figure 3 , center ) , is largely composed of cadherin - , claudin - and catenin - related proteins involved in “Cellular adhesion and junction” functions . Module 3 ( Figure 3 , bottom left ) includes proteins associated in “Axon Guidance” and “Developmental Biology” function . Taken together , the functional enrichment analysis from these three distinct sources ( GO , Reactome and KEGG ) indicate that the p140Cap interactors exhibit functions relevant to synaptic structure , synaptic transmission and plasticity . The p140CAP Interactome within the Structure of the PSD Given the enrichment in PSD ( Figure 2A ) , we examined previously described PSD protein network models to assess whether the p140Cap - interacting proteins form structural composites within the PSD or are rather randomly distributed Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 7 June 2017 | Volume 10 | Article 212 Alﬁeri et al . p140Cap as a Hub for Proteins Involved in Synaptopathies FIGURE 2 | p140Cap interacting proteins distribution in pre - and postsynaptic compartments and functional modules of the p140Cap interactome .

We built a protein - protein interaction ( PPI ) network based on a human PSD protein dataset combined with the interaction data from several public databases ( see Materials and Methods and Mclean Colin et al . , 2016 for details ) . Spectral cluster analysis was performed on the network as described in Mclean Colin et al . ( 2016 ) . Within the PSD network of 1 , 312 proteins , we identiﬁed 60 structural clusters based on the network topography . Essentially each cluster contains proteins that are more densely connected to other proteins within the cluster than to proteins elsewhere in the network ( Figure 4 ) . Functional enrichment was tested for each of the clusters to assess structure / function relationships within the molecular network ( the distribution of the proteins between the clusters and enrichment results are shown in Supplementary Table S4 ) . We then mapped the p140Cap - interacting proteins onto the network and identiﬁed the clusters that are more strongly enriched for p140Cap - interacting proteins compared to a random distribution . We found 4 clusters with signiﬁcant over - representation for p140Cap - interacting proteins : Cluster 7 ( Figure 4B ) ( 14 / 61 , P = 3 . 5E - 02 ) , Cluster 17 ( 12 / 21 , P = 3 . 62002E - 06 ) , Cluster 22 ( 28 / 80 , P = 7 . 05E - 07 ) , and Cluster 23 ( 13 / 39 , P = 1 . 4E - 03 ) . Cluster 22 ( Figure 4D ) is overrepresented with GO BP “glutamate receptor signaling pathway , ” “endocytosis , ” “cell - cell signaling , ” and “synaptic transmission” terms and contains the main PSD scaﬀolding proteins of the MAGUK family and their interactors . This cluster was also signiﬁcantly enriched with proteins from functional Module 1 ( see Figure 3 ) . Cluster 23 ( Figure 4E ) , was found to be associated with GO BP term “cell junction assembly , ” and was enriched with proteins from Module 2 ( see Figure 3 ) . Cluster 7 ( Figure 4B ) , was overrepresented with the “cytoskeleton organization , ” “actin cytoskeleton organization” and “cell junction assembly” terms and it contains proteins from Module 3 ( Figure 3 , Supplementary Table S4 ) .

We found a statistically signiﬁcant number of p140Cap interactors co - expressed with p140Cap in “All Samples , ” “Normal Tissues , ” “Brain , ” and “Central Nervous System” conserved co - expression networks ( Supplementary Tables S5 , S6 ) . The co - expression across p140Cap interactors was also signiﬁcant in six CCNs ( Supplementary Table S7 ) , including “All Samples , ” “Normal Tissues , ” “Brain , ” and “Central Nervous System” networks ( Supplementary Table S8 ) . Overall , these data show that the network of p140Cap - interacting proteins also reﬂects a gene co - expression cluster ( Figure 5 ) , indicating that the components of the p140Cap interactome might undergo coordinated mechanisms of tissue - speciﬁc transcription control . Disease Enrichment of p140Cap Related Proteins Synaptic dysfunction has emerged as a common theme in neurological and psychiatric disorders , and recent large - scale genetic studies in ASD and schizophrenia ( De Rubeis et al . , 2014 ; Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 9 June 2017 | Volume 10 | Article 212 Alﬁeri et al . p140Cap as a Hub for Proteins Involved in Synaptopathies FIGURE 4 | The p140Cap - interactome within the PSD ( A ) Clusters in the full PSD network . 60 structural clusters where obtained , including 4 signiﬁcantly enriched for p140Cap – interacting proteins ( purple ) , magniﬁed in panels B – E .

Fromer et al . , 2014 ) have further strengthened this hypothesis . The pathophysiological mechanisms might include abnormal expression of discrete synaptic proteins or the inability to organize into functional macromolecular complexes ( Bayes et al . , 2011 ) . We investigated the disease enrichment of the genes encoding p140Cap interacting molecules ( 351 genes ) , using gene - disease annotation data collected from OMIM ( http : / / omim . org / ) and Ensembl variation ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) databases mapped onto the HDO tree using the topOnto package ( https : / / github . com / statbio / topOnto ) . These analyses yielded a core background list of 14 , 111 gene - disease associations mapped onto 1 , 491 HDO terms . We also considered lists of risk genes and loci emerged from recent studies , including ASD ( Sanders et al . , 2015 ) , epilepsy ( EuroEPINOMIC - RES Consortium , 2014 ) , Bipolar Disorder ( Kataoka et al . , 2016 ) and Schizophrenia ( Fromer et al . , 2014 ; Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics , 2014 ) . The 826 gene - disease associations resulting from these analyses were then merged with the annotation set from the databases , yielding a total of 14 , 357 gene - disease associations mapped onto 1 , 491 HDO terms . Using the Topology - based Elimination Fisher method ( Alexa et al . , 2006 ) , we found that the p140Cap dataset is signiﬁcantly enriched for genes associated with schizophrenia ( P = 2 . 1E - 9 ) , ASD ( P = 7 . 9E - 6 ) , bipolar disorder ( P = 5 . 3E - 5 ) , ID ( 1 . 1E - 3 ) , and epilepsy ( 1 . 7E - 3 ) ( Table 1 , Supplementary Table S9 ) . Moreover , a further and independent evidence in supporting the role of p140Cap in neurological diseases came from the observation that the largest connected component of the sub - network of co - expression links of p140Cap - interactors among themselves and p140Cap in the All Tissues CCN contains several genes labeled as Disease Genes and involved in neurological diseases . These results indicate that p140Cap pathways , deﬁned by both protein - protein interactions and gene co - expression data , are relevant to psychiatric and neurological disorders . DISCUSSION The structure and the combinatorial use of a handful of modulatory elements give rise to complexity at subcellular , cellular , and systems level at the synapse ( Grant et al . , 2016 ) .

The most connected component of the co - expression network in “All Tissues CCN . ” p140Cap is shown in red , disease genes are in yellow . aﬀect such network , ultimately impacting synaptic function . Our results allow to propose that the p140Cap adaptor molecule acts as a key hub of synaptic networks . Our work is the ﬁrst comprehensive proteomic analysis of the synaptic interactome of p140Cap , which is indispensable for dendritic spine initiation and maturation and forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity ( Repetto et al . , 2014 ) . Our data show that the most prominent localization of p140Cap is within the PSD , with a signiﬁcant enrichment for pathways related to receptors traﬃcking and chemical signaling through the synapse , cellular adhesion and junction , and axon guidance . We also provide evidence that the p140Cap interactome forms a gene co - expression module . Although p140Cap itself has not been implicated in brain disease yet , our results unveil a robust association of the p140Cap interactome with neurological and psychiatric disorders , including schizophrenia , ID , epilepsy and ASD . Some of the p140Cap - interacting proteins associated to brain disorders have unknown functions in the brain . By mapping them to the synaptic p140Cap interactome , our study provides functional cues on these disease genes , including ROGDI , FRMD4A , and TRANK1 . Loss of ROGDI , encoding a protein with unknown function , causes Kohlschutter - Tonz syndrome ( MIM 614574 ) , which presents with psychomotor delay , early - onset intractable seizures , variable ID correlating with the severity of seizures , and amelogenesis imperfect ( Schossig et al . , 2012 ) . Genetic disruption of FRMD4A causes a syndrome characterized by congenital microcephaly accompanied by agenesis of corpus callosum and / or partial hypoplasia of the vermis and cerebellum and ID ( Fine et al . , 2015 ) ( MIM 616819 ) . FRMD4A regulates cell polarity in non - neuronal cells ( Ikenouchi and Umeda , 2010 ) and the microcephaly and brain malformations reported in carriers of FRMD4A mutations are compatible with defects in cell polarity in neuronal progenitors and / or newborn neurons . Beyond early brain development , our data also point to a synaptic function for FRMD4A . TRANK1 is a GWAS - associated locus for both schizophrenia ( Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics , 2014 ) and bipolar disorder ( Chen et al . , 2013 ; Muhleisen et al . , 2014 ) , but its functional roles in neurons are obscure . Again , our results locate it in the p140Cap synaptic network . There is robust evidence supporting the hypothesis that synaptic dysfunction is a shared mechanism underlying a broad range of brain disorders , and our data further corroborate it . For example , alterations in glutamatergic transmission can result in a broad spectrum of psychiatric conditions . In our dataset , we detected AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits associated with schizophrenia ( i . e . , GRIA1 and GRIN2A ) and with a spectrum of DD / ID , ASD and seizures , often in co - morbidity ( GRIA3 , GRIN1 , GRIN2A , and GRIN2B ) . Glutamatergic transmission is intertwined with synaptic calcium dynamics ( Higley and Sabatini , 2012 ) , and large - scale genetic studies have shown that disruption of voltage - gated calcium channels is a pathological mechanism across psychiatric disorders ( Cross - Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics , 2013 ) . Notably , this pathway holds potential for rapid therapeutic intervention ( Lencz and Malhotra , 2015 ) . Seven VGCC subunits were found in the p140Cap interactome and four of them are associated to disease . CACNA1A haploinsuﬃciency can cause episodic ataxia type 2 ( MIM 108500 ) , familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 ( MIM 141500 ) and spinocerebellar ataxia 6 ( MIM 183086 ) . More recently , CACNA1A mutations have been described in individuals diagnosed with ID , epilepsy , ADHD and / or ASD ( Damaj et al . , 2015 ) . CACNA2D1 and CACNA2D2 are both associated with epilepsy and ID ( Edvardson et al . , 2013 ; Pippucci et al . , 2013 ; Vergult et al . , 2015 ) , while CACN2D3 has been recently implicated in ASD ( De Rubeis et al . , 2014 ) . Interestingly , none of the reproducible GWAS - associated loci in schizophrenia CACNA1C , CACNA1H , and CACNB2 ( Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics , 2014 ) was detected in our dataset . However , several RIM proteins that are necessary for VGCCs regulation , including the schizophrenia - associated RIMS1 ( Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics , 2014 ) , are detected in the p140Cap interactome . Psychiatric manifestations are often accompanied by defects in neuronal morphogenesis , and abnormalities of dendritic spines ( either the number or the shape ) , which are one of Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 11 June 2017 | Volume 10 | Article 212 Alﬁeri et al . p140Cap as a Hub for Proteins Involved in Synaptopathies TABLE 1 | Disease enrichment of p140Cap related proteins .

The agreement among the orders of magnitude for both methods indicates the strong over - representation of respective disease genes among the p140Cap interacting proteins . the most robust neuroanatomical correlate of ID and often a ﬁnding in ASD and schizophrenia ( Penzes et al . , 2011 ) . p140Cap and many of its interactors play a role in the formation , maturation and maintenance of dendritic spines . Speciﬁcally , deﬁciency of p140Cap results in an excess of immature ﬁlopodial - like protrusions at the expenses of mature mushroom spines ( Tomasoni et al . , 2013 ; Repetto et al . , 2014 ) . Depletion , ablation or mutations of many p140Cap interactors , including CNKSR2 ( CNK2 ) ( Lim et al . , 2014 ) , CTNNB1 ( β - catenin ) ( Okuda et al . , 2007 ) , CTNND2 ( δ - catenin ) ( Arikkath et al . , 2009 ) , phenocopy these defects . Conversely , other p140Cap - associated proteins are needed for spine maintenance and their silencing results in reduced spine density and / or spine shrinkage , as documented for CASK ( Chao et al . , 2008 ) and ANK3 ( Smith et al . , 2014 ) . All these genes are associated with psychiatric conditions , ranging from ID i . e . , CNKSR2 ( Kessels and Malinow , 2009 ; Vaags et al . , 2014 ) , CTNNB1 ( Tucci et al . , 2014 ) , ANK3 ( Iqbal et al . , 2013 ) , CASK ( Tarpey et al . , 2009 ) and ASD i . e . , CTNND2 ( Turner et al . , 2015 ) , ANK3 ( Iqbal et al . , 2013 ) to schizophrenia i . e . , CNKSR2 ( GWAS , PGC - SCZ 2014 ) and bipolar disorder ANK3 ( Ferreira et al . , 2008 ) . Similarly , the impairment in LTP and LTD and the deﬁcits in memory and learning observed in the p140Cap KO mice ( Repetto et al . , 2014 ) could be sustained by improper functioning and / or localisation of several of these newly identiﬁed p140Cap interactors , such as the NMDARs subunits , the AMPA receptors , PSD - 95 , and the Shank family . GRIN1 , GRIN2A , and GRIN2B are key in LTP induction , synaptic plasticity , learning and memory ( Bliss and Collingridge , 1993 ; Bliss et al . , 2014 ; Shipton and Paulsen , 2014 ) . Synaptic traﬃcking of AMPARs is necessary for the induction of LTP , and GluR1 - deﬁcient mice exhibit impaired hippocampus - dependent spatial working memory and one - trial spatial memory ( Kessels and Malinow , 2009 ) . In mice lacking PSD - 95 , NMDA - dependent LTP and LTD frequency is shifted to enhanced LTP , consistent with severely impaired spatial learning ( Migaud et al . , 1998 ) . Mice mutant for Shank proteins exhibit a large spectrum of defects in LTP and LTD ( Yoo et al . , 2014 ) . Identifying the molecular complexes controlling forms of plasticity that underlie memory consolidation and retrieval has direct implications for ID and associated co - morbidities , including ASD and ADHD . It is also important for psychiatric disorders with a cognitive impairment component and / or with a premorbid cognitive deﬁcit , as documented in schizophrenia ( Reichenberg et al . , 2010 ) . As mentioned above , SRCIN1 has not been genetically associated with psychiatric disorders . A de novo missense variant resulting in a p . Glu912Asp change predicted to be probably damaging by the bioinformatic predictor Polyphen - 2 and not detected in the 60 , 706 unrelated controls of the Exome Aggregation Database ( ExAC ) was found in a schizophrenia cohort ( Fromer et al . , 2014 ) . Further , based on the data in ExAC , SRCIN1 is signiﬁcantly depleted in both loss - of - function and missense variants , indicating that the gene is highly intolerant to detrimental variation and so likely a source of disease risk if mutated . In conclusion , our ﬁndings place p140Cap at the crossroad of a highly susceptible synaptic network disrupted in psychiatric and neurological disorders . These ﬁndings reinforce the current hypothesis that synaptic dysfunction is a component of all these disorders and have repercussions on our understanding of the underpinnings of psychiatric disorders and their shared comorbidity .
