Pieters * b Carbohydrate – protein interactions are involved in a multitude of biological recognition processes . Since individual protein – carbohydrate interactions are usually weak , multivalency is often required to achieve biologically relevant binding aﬃnities and selectivities . Among the possible mechanisms responsible for binding enhancement by multivalency , the simultaneous attachment of a multivalent ligand to several binding sites of a multivalent receptor ( i . e . chelation ) has been proven to have a strong impact . This article summarizes recent examples of chelating lectin ligands of diﬀerent size . Covered lectins include the Shiga - like toxin , where the shortest distance between binding sites is ca . 9 Å , wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) ( shortest distance between binding sites 13 – 14 Å ) , LecA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( shortest distance 26 Å ) , cholera toxin and heat - labile enterotoxin ( shortest distance 31 Å ) , anti - HIV antibody 2G12 ( shortest distance 31 Å ) , concanavalin A ( ConA ) ( shortest distance 72 Å ) , RCA 120 ( shortest distance 100 Å ) , and Erythrina cristagalli ( ECL ) ( shortest distance 100 Å ) . While chelating binding of the discussed ligands is likely , experimental proof , for example by X - ray crystallography , is limited to only a few cases . 1 .

Rev . , 2013 , 42 , 4492 - - 4503 4493 Since the individual protein – carbohydrate interactions are weak it often takes a multitude of simultaneous interactions , i . e . multivalency , to produce a biological eﬀect . 3 – 7 Since blocking the carbohydrate binding proteins or lectins may be beneficial for treating certain diseases , the aspect of multivalency cannot be ignored . In fact , incorporating multivalency into the design of inhibitors may even be necessary to achieve suﬃcient inhibitory potency . Many researchers have taken this lesson to heart and have designed and synthesized multivalent inhibitors with a large variety of architectures . 8 , 9 It is currently well accepted that both bridging and non - bridging systems can exhibit multivalency eﬀects with a suitable target lectin . Strong eﬀects of several orders of magnitude can be observed with systems of low valency capable of bridging binding sites , also called the chelation mechanism . 8 Creating well - designed ligand systems is expected to result in both dramatically enhanced potency and also selectivity . The selectivity aspect is attainable with a more rigid and well - designed system that binds strongly only to a single target with the matched interbinding site distances , yet leaves all other lectins with the same carbohydrate specificity untouched . Besides the bridging ones , non - bridging systems can also be eﬀective . The mecha - nism leading to their enhanced potency is often called ‘statis - tical rebinding’ , 10 , 11 where a nearby ligand quickly replaces the bound ligand due to its proximity , leading to reduced oﬀ - rates . These eﬀects are often observed when binding sites of a lectin are spaced far apart or when only a single binding site is present . In specific cases , high valency systems 12 or a spherical geometry 13 were shown to be successful . This review focuses on bridging systems although , especially when bridging large distances with large high - valent systems , both mechanisms may operate simultaneously . 8 The following sections discuss multisite lectins , in most cases of medical relevance , where the interbinding site distances increase from section to section . For the Shiga - like toxin the shortest distance is ca . 9 Å whereas in the final section lectins with interbinding site distances of ca . 100 Å are discussed . Clearly diﬀerent design solutions are required for these very diﬀerent systems . We did not aim to be comprehensive , rather chose striking , mostly recent examples especially if they illustrate the bridging theme . The assays that were used to determine the potency enhancement eﬀects are mentioned in the discussion . Progress has been made across the whole spectrum , but the full potential has only been harnessed in a few cases , with more to be explored and exciting developments to be expected . 2 . Shiga - like toxin The Shiga toxins are part of the AB 5 toxins and are produced by Shigella dysenteriae but also by enterohemorrhagic E . coli ( EHEC ) that produces the so - called Shiga - like toxins ( SLT - I and SLT - II ) . The Shiga - like toxins can lead to diarrhea but also to the serious hemolytic uremic syndrome ( HUD ) after the toxin enters circulation from the gut . 14 Blocking the toxin is of medical interest and most likely too late in the intestine and therapeutically more viable in circulation . 15 There are also reasons to make the toxin the target for treatment rather than the bacterium that produces it . This approach induces less resistance and the toxins may still cause symptoms after their producer is cleared . 14 The Shiga toxins are an interesting group of lectins for the design and evaluation of multivalency eﬀects because of their numerous carbohydrate binding sites . They contain three binding sites of unequal aﬃnity for its natural Gb3 ligand ( Gal a 1 , 4Gal b 1 , 4Glc b Cer ) per monomeric B - subunit . The shortest distance between binding sites appears to be as low as 9 Å , 16 i . e . one of the shortest distances present between lectin binding sites . However consi - dering the large number of binding sites numerous distances are present ranging up to ca . 50 Å . For this reason the toxin binds well to most multivalent systems that can achieve a certain degree of chelation , possibly supplemented by binding multiple toxins i . e . aggregation into higher order structures . The first to study the possibility for chelation with the Shiga like toxin were Toone and coworkers 17 They noted distinct potency enhancements for divalent ligands using peptidic spacers . The enhancements in an ELISA type assay were up to 95 - fold ( 48 - fold per sugar ) . It was curious that the binding stoichiometry varied with the use of a hydrophobic or hydro - philic spacer , clearly indicating an additional role of the spacer . Multivalent inhibitors were prepared by Bundle et al . who used a pentavalent core structure . 18 In compound 1 ( Fig . 1 ) ten globotriose moieties were attached to the five arms that were linked to the glucose - based core structure . The shape of the construct led to its name Starfish . The globotriose units were linked via their O2 0 after inspection of the X - ray structure . Very high inhibitory potencies were observed for SLT - I , with a multi - valency enhancement of 875500 , as determined in an ELISA - like assay with immobilized toxin . The design included two globo - triose units per arm to bind to two of the binding sites per subunit , however in the crystal structure of the complex it was observed that a hamburger shaped 2 : 1 complex was formed in which two toxins bound to one inhibitor and the two globo - triose units per arm each occupied a binding site in a diﬀerent toxin . A similar approach was based on a carbosilane dendritic scaﬀold to which copies of globotriose were linked . 19 For 2 , one member of this so - called Super - Twig family , the K d s for Stx1 and Stx2 were 110 and 210 nM , respectively , i . e . a major improvement over the typical monovalent K d of ca . 1 mM . 17 Gold glyconanoparticles that contain the globotriose sugar were also prepared . 20 Particles with sizes ranging from 4 to 20 nm were reported containing between 60 and 2000 sugars on the surface . These particles were tested as inhibitors of the SLT - I B - subunit binding to an SPR chip surface . The particles proved to be very potent inhibitors with relative potencies per sugar ranging from 1300 for the smallest particles to 228 000 for the larger 3 . The enhanced potencies were also used for the purpose of a sensitive detection method . Polymers with attached globotriose units ( 4 ) were also prepared and tested as inhibitors of SLT - I . 21 Enhancements of 5000 - fold per sugar were determined in this case . In a recent study chitosan was used as the scaﬀold polymer for globotriose conjugation , which resulted in a K d as low as 50 nM per trisaccharide ligand , while Review Article Chem Soc Rev 4494 Chem . Soc . Rev . , 2013 , 42 , 4492 - - 4503 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 the monovalent ligand showed essentially no binding at 162 m M . 22 Oral activity in a mouse model was demonstrated . Detection of the Shiga - like toxin is also of importance for diagnostic and public health purposes . Weiss , Iyer and coworkers reported an analytical system based on the recognition of the divalent 5 . 23 Surprisingly , the use of GalNAc instead of Gal makes the molecule specific for the more toxic Stx2 . The C6 spacers in the arms were shown to perform better than their C12 counterparts . An alternative detection system was based on the recognition of a BSA – galabiose conjugate . From a biological sample an immobilized antibody was able to capture the toxin and the visualization of the BSA construct binding led to selective toxin detection . 24 Most multivalent systems bind well to the Shiga - like toxins . This is likely due to the many binding sites they contain and the many interbinding site distances that can be accommodated . All binding sites are also present on the same side of the protein complex , to facilitate simultaneous binding . This chelate - type binding is almost certainly the origin of the very strong inhibition by even relatively low valency inhibitors . 3 . Wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) WGA is one of the ‘classical’ lectins used for studying multivalent carbohydrate – protein interactions . It is enriched in the seeds of wheat ( Triticum vulgaris ) and occurs in three closely related isoforms . 25 , 26 WGA is specific for terminal N - acetylneuraminic acid and GlcNAc and has been shown to inhibit fungal growth through interaction with fungal cell - wall components 27 , 28 and to agglutinate transformed cells in vitro . 29 , 30 The lectin exists as a stable homodimer with a twofold symmetry axis . Each monomer consists of four 43 - amino acid residues hevein domains ( A – D ) that are arranged in tandem upon ‘‘head to tail’’ dimerization of the monomers . The monomer / monomer interface accom - modates eight functional sugar binding sites ( four unique sites due to the twofold symmetry axis ) between contacting domains with side chains of both monomers interacting with the saccharide ligands . 31 These ligands are GlcNAc or b - ( 1 , 4 ) - linked GlcNAc oligomers ( chitooligosaccharides , such as N , N 0 - diacetyl - chitobiose , N , N 0 , N 00 - triacetylchitotriose , . . . ) . The binding sites are labeled as pairs of capitals ( each followed by the number of the monomer it belongs to ) indicating the hevein subunit which provides the aromatic residues and the polar residues , respectively . In D , the polar residues are absent , so that the sites are A1 , B1C2 , C1B2 , D1A2 , A2 , B2C1 , C2B1 , D2A1 . The binding sites involving A and D exhibit lower aﬃnity than those formed from B and C . Consequently , the sites involving the B and C domains have been termed ‘‘primary’’ binding sites and the ones involving the A and D domains ‘‘secondary’’ binding sites . The closest distances between pairs of adjacent binding sites ( B1C2 / C2B1 , C1B2 / B2C1 , A1 / D2A1 , D1A2 / A2 ) are 13 – 14 Å ( distances between anomeric oxygens of two bound GlcNAc residues ) . 32 Linear distances between other pairs of primary binding sites range from 29 Å ( C1B2 / C2B1 ) to 37 Å ( B1C2 / B2C1 ) . However , ligands supposed to bridge these pairs need to be considerably longer due to the presence of protruding protein parts . Several multivalent ligands have been described that are expected to bind in a chelating binding mode ( Fig . 2 ) . Zanini and Roy reported glycodendrimers with valencies up to 8 that were investigated by an enzyme - linked lectin assay ( ELLA ) . 33 The best ligand was octavalent 6 with an IC 50 value of at least 170 times lower than that of GlcNAc - a - OAll corresponding to an Fig . 1 X - ray structure of Shiga like toxin ( SLT - 1 ) in complex with its ligands and drawn structures of Shiga like toxin binders . Chem Soc Rev Review Article This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Chem . Soc . Rev . , 2013 , 42 , 4492 - - 4503 4495 increased binding potency of more than 21 - fold per sugar . Interestingly , although the distances between the GlcNAc moieties within 6 are considerably longer than 14 Å , these numbers are moderate . Much higher multivalency eﬀects were observed with calix [ 4 ] arene 7 ( ref . 34 ) and glycodendrimer 8 . 35 The tetravalent glycoconjugate 7 inhibited hemagglutination 312 - fold better per contained sugar than free GlcNAc and for octavalent 8 a potency enhancement of 4700 - fold per contained sugar was determined by an ELLA . Hexavalent 9 is an example of a multivalent lactotriose derivative . 36 Its binding enhance - ment was 424 - fold per saccharide compared to a single tri - saccharide as determined by a fluorescence - based binding assay .

Rev . , 2013 , 42 , 4492 - - 4503 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Interestingly , a dodecavalent analog was less eﬀective both in absolute numbers ( K d = 0 . 77 m M versus 0 . 36 m M for 9 ) and in terms of binding enhancement per lactotriose moiety ( 98 - fold ) . GlcNAc - modified quantum dots have also been employed as WGA ligands and showed binding enhancements of 3 – 4 orders of magnitude over the corresponding monovalent ligand . 37 When comparing binding potencies of ligands , it is important to keep in mind that the determined potencies are strongly dependent on the assay , a phenomenon that has often been observed . 38 – 40 The reason behind this observation is that most assays do not provide K d values but rather IC 50 values that are dependent on the assay setup . As an example we determined the WGA binding potency of tetravalent neoglycopeptide 10 by two types of ELLA employing either porcine stomach mucin ( PSM ) 41 or covalently immobilized GlcNAc 40 as the matrix on a microtiter plate . Whereas with the PSM matrix an IC 50 value of 380 m M ( corresponding to a binding enhancement of 54 per sugar ) was noted , the GlcNAc matrix led to an IC 50 of 16 m M ( 360 - fold enhancement per sugar ) . Thus , binding potencies should only be directly compared when determined by the same assay . To allow a chelating binding mode of a multivalent ligand to become eﬀective , a careful design of the spacer between indi - vidual sugar epitopes is needed . For cases in which a design is not possible due to missing structural information , we employed a combinatorial approach with one - bead one - compound libraries . 42 Using cyclic peptides as scaﬀolds , a library of almost 20000 glycoclusters was prepared and screened for WGA ligands . 41 Interestingly , the best ligand within this library contained fewer than the maximum possible number of sugar residues . Later , we developed the tetravalent neoglycopep - tide 11 . 32 An IC 50 value of 0 . 9 m M ( corresponding to a binding enhancement of 6400 - fold per sugar ) was determined by an ELLA . A remarkable multivalency eﬀect was also observed with the simple divalent ligand 12 ( 1170 - fold binding enhancement per sugar ) featuring an a - glycosidic linkage as in 11 . 32 X - ray crystallo - graphy of the complex of WGA and the somewhat weaker , closely related 13 explained this activity . Four divalent mole - cules simultaneously bind to WGA with each ligand bridging adjacent binding sites . This showed for the first time that all eight sugar binding sites of the WGA dimer are simultaneously functional . The structure also illustrated that the a - glycosidic linkage is a key feature of the spanning ligands because the axial glycosidic bonds of bound GlcNAc pairs point towards each other . With b - glycosidic linkages , a considerably longer linker would be required . X - ray crystal structure analysis of the complex of 11 bound to WGA revealed that indeed 11 binds to the lectin in a chelating binding mode with two sugars bridging two primary binding sites . 32 Comparison of the X - ray structure and the NMR - derived solution structure of 11 suggests that the cyclic glycopeptide is preorganized in solution in a way that supports divalent binding . Since binding mechanisms of multivalent interactions may diﬀer in a densely packed crystal from those in solution , we employed distance measurements in the nanometer range using EPR spectroscopy of spin - labeled WGA ligands 14 to study multivalent binding in solution . 43 Distributions of dis - tances r AB between the nitroxide labels in the presence and absence of WGA provided , for the first time , structural evidence for chelating binding to the protein in ( frozen ) solution . In addition , it was possible to observe successive binding of labeled monovalent ligands to the multivalent protein , thereby identifying diﬀerences in binding aﬃnities among the primary binding sites . Since the WGA binding aﬃnity of N , N 0 - diacetylchitobiose is significantly higher compared to that of GlcNAc , multivalent ligands containing up to four chitobiose moieties were designed and synthesized . 44 , 45 Divalent 15 was investigated by an ELLA and has a binding potency that is 500 - fold per chitobiose moiety higher than that of chitobiose . 45 Although this enhancement is lower than that of divalent GlcNAc ligand 12 , 15 is the better ligand in terms of the IC 50 value ( 0 . 6 m M for 15 versus 9 . 8 m M for 12 determined by the same ELLA ) . Molecular modeling supported a chelating binding mechanism for 15 . The best ligand in this series was a trivalent chitobiose - containing ligand with an IC 50 value of 220 nM . 45 A very similar IC 50 ( 180 nM ) was determined for tetravalent ligand 16 . 44 However , this value was the result of a hemagglutination inhibition assay . Interestingly , tetravalent 16 led to precipitation of WGA in a certain submillimolar concentration range whereas this was not observed for 15 . The world record in potency enhancement is currently held by the octavalent GlcNAc derivative 17 featuring an octasilsesquioxane scaﬀold . 46 The ELLA - determined IC 50 value of 3 nM corresponds to a binding enhancement of an impressive 6 orders of magnitude per sugar , likely due to a chelating binding mode . In summary , WGA inhibition studies have provided impor - tant insights into chelation type of multivalent interactions . The potency enhancements were large even for low valency systems . Importantly , both in solutions ( EPR probes ) and in the solid state ( X - ray ) a chelation type of binding was confirmed for the first time . 4 . LecA The lectins LecA and LecB ( or PA - IL and PA - IIL ) are of medicinal interest and challenging targets for the design of multivalent inhibitors . These proteins are adhesion proteins and virulence factors of the problematic pathogen P . aeruginosa . 47 Unlike most adhesion proteins these adhesins are not covalently linked to the cell surface . Instead they are soluble proteins that can bind non - covalently to the cell surface using at least one of their four carbohydrate binding sites . 48 Besides playing a role in the infection process the lectins are also involved in biofilm formation . 49 LecA is specific for galactosides and is a tetramer . Two of the binding sites are relatively close together at ca . 26 Å while the next closest distance is ca . 80 Å . 50 For a chelation type of interaction the two most closely spaced sites are of interest . Strikingly , from a study on calixarene conjugates the most potent isomer was the 1 , 3 - dialternate as in 18a which seems Chem Soc Rev Review Article This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Chem . Soc . Rev . , 2013 , 42 , 4492 - - 4503 4497 to be preorganized to chelate the two nearby binding sites ( Fig . 3 ) . It did so with a K d determined by ITC of 176 nM , i . e . an 852 - fold ( 212 - fold per sugar ) binding enhancement in compar - ison with a relevant monovalent reference compound . 51 Inter - estingly , the compound can simultaneously bind two LecA tetramers due to its symmetry . The result is that a polymeric fiber - like aggregate forms containing alternating LecA subunits and tetravalent 18a molecules . These fibers were observed by atomic force microscopy . 52 Further attempts were undertaken to optimize the potencies and a slight reduction in spacer arm flexibility led to an additional two - fold improvement for 18b ( IC 50 = 90 nM ) with a relative potency of 1138 ( 285 - fold per sugar ) when compared to just the monovalent ‘arm’ molecule . 53 The sugar ligand structures of 18 reach their neighboring binding sites with the calixarene allowing adjustment in the spacing due to a hinge - like action . While obviously good results can be obtained from such a design we opted for a diﬀerent design . This design entailed a straight bridge between the binding sites consisting of a rigid spacer and at the termini some more flexible sections to allow the necessary adjustability . 54 A series of compounds was prepared and yielded both very poor and very potent inhibitors , in line with the predictions dictated by the design . In comparison with a monovalent reference compound , the divalent 19a showed no improvement in an ELISA type assay . 35 This suggests that its spacer was too short to allow binding at both binding sites simultaneously . The somewhat elongated 19b was a 545 - fold ( 272 - fold per sugar ) better inhibitor than the reference compound with an IC 50 of 220 nM . Molecular modeling supported the experimental findings . 54 This example shows a hint of what is possible with spacer design and how potencies can skyrocket with minor spacer alterations , with likely similar benefits in selectivity . The spacer of 19a and 19b consists of a repeating pattern of glucose moieties linked in a b - 1 , 4 fashion to triazole units . Cu - catalyzed azide – alkyne cycloaddition ( CuAAC ) was used to elongate the spacer and the multiple hydroxyl groups ensure good aqueous solubility . In this design rotation is possible but the overall shape of the spacer remains mostly linear . In another study by Roy , Imberty and coworkers , C - galactosides were optimized as monovalent ligands and subsequently incorporated into multi - valent systems . 55 The most potent was the nonavalent 20 ( K d 230 nM ) , which was on a per sugar basis a 45 - fold more potent ligand than the b - Gal - O - Me reference compound , as determined by ITC . Based on modeling and determination of the solvodynamic diameter of their multivalent constructs the authors concluded that the systems could not reach both binding sites simultaneously and that chelation would there - fore not occur . The enhanced potency was therefore attributed to aggregative phenomena . Gold nanoparticles outfitted with galactosides were also shown to be potent LecA binders . 56 The size and epitope density are important factors in the potency and also the assay method showed some variability . Particularly striking was the K d of 50 nM per sugar of a particle displaying ca . 67 galactosides as determined by ITC . The particle is easily large enough to allow chelation , but in addition its spherical nature and high Fig . 3 Structures of LecA and reported inhibitors . Review Article Chem Soc Rev 4498 Chem .

Similarly , linking of 12 galactosides to a fullerene ( 21 ) resulted in very high potencies , with the most striking result being an IC 50 of 40 nM representing a relative potency per sugar of 458 fold . 57 While no mechanistic insights were given , a combination of statistical rebinding with some degree of chelation seems the most likely . The tetravalent glycopeptide inhibitor 22 was described by Reymond et al . that showed a K d of 100 nM , i . e . a 35 - fold enhancement per sugar when com - pared to p - nitrophenyl - b - galactoside . 58 Based on molecular simulation studies , the authors concluded that chelation was not possible with this system , but simultaneous binding of multiple proteins was possible . From the above it is clear that there is a major amount of recent activity dedicated to finding multivalent LecA inhibitors . These compounds vary from linear dimers to gold glyconano - particles and all have yielded major potency enhancements . Relatively few claim chelation to be the driving force for the enhancement . In some cases a rebinding or aggregative mecha - nism was coined while mixed mechanisms may be involved in certain cases . Instead of using a trial and error approach , a well - defined system like LecA is ideal for the design of inhibitors using the interbinding site distance as a ruler . In cases where medicinal applications are the goal , selectivity is important and the diﬀerentiation between related compounds 19a and 19b suggests that this can be achieved . 5 . Cholera toxin and heat - labile enterotoxin The cholera toxin ( CT ) is a relative of the Shiga - like toxin in the AB 5 - toxin family . In this case the 5 B - subunits contain only 5 carbohydrate binding sites and the spacing between the binding sites is ca . 31 Å . 59 The toxin is the causative agent of the cholera disease . The heat - labile enterotoxin of E . coli ( LT ) is the causative agent of ‘traveller’s diarrhea’ and is closely related to CT with ca . 80 % sequence homology . The 5 binding sites of these toxins are located on the same face of the protein pentamer , which makes simultaneous binding to the nascent GM1 gangliosides on the intestinal cell surface very favorable . This multivalent binding is followed by internalization of the toxin and disease progression due to the A - subunit , resulting in massive diarrhea . The work by Hol , Fan and coworkers clearly showed the promise of a multivalent approach of inhibition by using a pentavalent pentacyclen core structure with 5 appendages terminating in galactoside moieties . 60 This team has brought the spacer length issue to the forefront of the design of the multivalent carbohydrate field . They applied the theory of Kramer and Karpen , 61 who showed the importance of matching the spacer length with the interbinding site distance , i . e . spacers can be too short or too long . Furthermore , for flexible spacers , such as PEG , the average length of the spacer is far shorter than the extended conformation , due to folding . This so - called eﬀective length is proportional to the square root of the number of PEG monomers . A similar rationale is to use the Flory radius which can readily be calculated for PEG based spacers . 62 Using pentacyclen and also cyclic peptides as penta - valent core structures and galactose as the ligand ( 23a , b , 24 , Fig . 4 ) , it was shown that the potency enhancements varied a great deal with the spacer length , and optimal lengths were obtained , in line with expectations based on the eﬀective lengths . Compound 23a ( n = 4 ) was the most potent LTB 5 inhibitor in a series ( n = 1 – 4 ) with a potency enhancement of almost 9000 - fold ( 1786 - fold per sugar ) over a relevant reference compound . 60 Similarly 23b ( n = 4 ) was the best in its series ( n = 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ) for CTB 5 inhibition . 63 For the larger cyclic peptide scaﬀold of 24 ( n = 1 – 4 ) , it was the shorter arm that was the most eﬀective ( n = 2 ) , with optimal inhibitory potencies being similar to those of 23a , b i . e . in the low micromolar range . Taking the spacer design criteria of Hol and Fan into account we used a dendritic scaﬀold to which long spacer arms were attached as is shown for 25a , b . Both the natural pentasaccharide ligand , the GM1 oligosaccharide ( GM1os ) , and a more simple galactoside ligand were linked to the dendrimers . Valencies of 2 , 4 , and 8 were used . For 25a a potency enhancement was observed over 30 000 - fold ( 7600 - fold per sugar ) when compared to a mono - valent GM1os derivative and an IC 50 of 230 pM . 64 The multi - valent galactoside 25b was also tested and found to be as eﬀective as a monovalent GM1 derivative in the ELISA - like inhibition assay ( IC 50 in a low micromolar range ) . 65 The multivalency eﬀect was able to overcome the many orders of magnitude diﬀerence when comparing GM1os to the weakly binding galactoside monovalent ligand . Besides the multiva - lency approach a structure - based approach of optimizing monovalent ligands has also been developed . 66 Recently such an improvement strategy was combined with the attachment of the newly built ligands to a multivalent polymeric backbone such as dextran . 67 Very potent compounds resulted from the study as exemplified by 26 , which surpris - ingly contained an a - linked galactoside , in contrast to the natural ligand GM1os which contains a b - linkage to the terminal non - reducing galactoside . In summary , the cholera toxin is a highly suitable target for the exploration of multivalent ligands . From a mechanistic point of view it is more complicated than e . g . LecA which only has two nearby binding sites . Due to the five binding sites numerous interbinding site distances are available . The chelation mechanism can easily be mixed with cross - linking or aggregation - type mechanisms as was observed e . g . for 25a . 68 The valency mismatch between the toxin and the ligand was the likely cause of the aggregation , but it is unclear if that contributed to the high inhibitory potency . 6 .

It binds to a cluster of mannose moieties on the gp120 envelop glyco - protein . 69 , 70 The crystal structure of 2G12 in complex with the oligosaccharide Man 9 GlcNAc 2 27 revealed that the antibody forms a tightly packed interlocked dimer via a three - dimensional swap of the V H domains resulting in two additional ( secondary ) Chem Soc Rev Review Article This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Chem .

Rev . , 2013 , 42 , 4492 - - 4503 4499 binding sites at the V H / V H 0 interface ( Fig . 5 ) . 71 , 72 This extra - ordinary structure provides the multivalent surface necessary for multiple interactions with the gp120 oligomannose resi - dues . According to the crystal structure , the distance between the two primary binding sites of the antibody is 31 Å . 73 Each of the two oligosaccharides 27 found in the complex bind with the D1 arm to one of the primary binding sites with the majority of contacts with the terminal Man ( a 1 - 2 ) Man disaccharide ( sugars C and D1 ) . The D2 arms provide additional contacts with the secondary binding sites mainly with mannose A . The distance between the anomeric oxygens of the terminal Man ( a 1 - 2 ) Man disaccharides of the D1 and D2 branches ( mannose residues A and C ) is 9 . 5 Å . Whereas several groups positioned oligosaccharide 27 or substructures thereof on diﬀerent scaﬀold molecules , such as cyclic peptides , 74 , 75 or as part of dendrons 76 leading to varyingly increased binding aﬃnities , Winssinger et al . systematically screened glycosylated PNA – DNA hybrids with diﬀerent sugar spacings . 85 Two Man ( a 1 - 2 ) Man disaccharides were connected by a linker via S - glycosidic bonds mimicking the substructure Fig . 5 X - ray structure of dimeric Fab 2G12 in complex with two molecules of 27 ( ref . 71 ) ( D1 and D2 arms colored blue in the formula are shown with space filling models in the structure ) and synthetic ligands .

Such glycosylated PNAs were then hybridized onto diﬀerent DNA templates resulting in varying distances between the oligosaccharide mimics . The obtained glycoclusters were then tested for binding to 2G12 by SPR . It turned out that both the spacing between the covalently linked Man ( a 1 - 2 ) Man disaccharides as well as the topology of the supramolecular architecture are important for high - aﬃnity binding . Only oligo - saccharide mimics of type 28 with 11 atoms between the anomeric sulfur atoms bound to 2G12 . This is the same spacing as in 27 . Considering the distance between the oligosaccharide mimics , a complex of type 29 ( maximum distance between the branching points joining the disaccharides is 38 . 5 Å ) was the best binder ( K d = 4 . 2 m M ) . Longer distances as in 30 diminished binding aﬃnity in line with the required distance of approx . 31 Å . Whereas Winssinger et al . investigated 29 individually synthesized glycoclusters as 2G12 ligands , the group of Krauss and Hedstrom employed a SELEX - type technique to screen approx . 2 (cid:2) 10 13 diﬀerent glycoclusters . 77 In their approach named SELMA ( selection with modified aptamers ) , single - stranded DNA functions as a scaﬀold for positioning glycans . However , the DNA molecules themselves might also contain additional binding elements for interaction with the target . SELMA is a multistep procedure that allows to screen and amplify modified DNA . Employed was an alkyne - modified deoxyuridine triphosphate that is accepted by the polymerase used for the library preparation . In a click reaction the library of alkyne - DNA was then reacted with azide - substituted oligo - mannoside 31 representing the D1 arm of 2G12 ligand 27 . The glyco - DNA library was then screened for 2G12 binding and subsequently amplified making use of a coding DNA strand . In this way , the group was able to identify a series of DNA glycoclusters containing 7 – 14 glycosylation sites with K d values down to 220 nM . Mutation experiments revealed that the aﬃnity of the selected ligands is sequence - dependent and not simply the result of high valency . Furthermore , it was shown that binding is dependent on the tertiary structure of the ligands . Obviously , not all glycans contained in the ligands were involved in direct sugar binding . However , their removal resulted in reduced aﬃnity suggesting that they are important for maintaining the correct tertiary structure . The long - term goal of such studies is the development of antigens for use as vaccines against HIV . 7 . Bridging longer distances Moving to larger distances is a great challenge . Doing this eﬀectively with spacers based on PEG is not likely to succeed . According to the Flory radius 62 of PEG - based systems , it takes ca . 27 PEG units to bridge just 25 Å and ca . 85 units to bridge 50 Å . These spacers become impractically long and will also likely not allow the creation of selective systems . Therefore researchers have turned to other types of spacers to bridge longer distances . DNA has been used in a few cases as a spacer . Naturally the length of DNA - based spacers can be tuned very well and also the valency . Recently such a system was described for the inhibition of concanavalin A ( ConA ) . This lectin binds to both a - linked glucosides and mannosides with a preference for the latter . It contains four tetrahedrally oriented subunits that are spaced ca . 72 Å apart . 78 A trigonal DNA – carbohydrate conjugate consisting of a three way junction piece of DNA was designed to contain multiple copies of maltose . 79 Notably those systems that contained sugars in all three arms bound most strongly to ConA , presumably by bridging to three of its four binding sites . The aﬃnities were determined in a fluorescence assay . The most potent compound was 32 , which contained 18 sugars and showed a K d of 1 m M , which was 760 - fold more potent ( 42 - fold per sugar ) than monovalent maltose ( Fig . 6 ) . With ConA it is clear that the chelation mechanism is only possible for large systems . These systems should also be capable of the statistical rebinding mechanism , as was shown by Mangold and Cloninger . 80 The fact that the rebinding mechanism can be very eﬃcient is illustrated by compound 33 , which is both relatively small and of relatively low valency , yet exhibited a very large potency enhancement of 3750 - fold per sugar in a hemagglutination inhibition assay in comparison with Me - a - D - glucopyranoside . 81 The results of the three way junction DNA with ConA can also be due to the rebinding mechanism but this seems less likely . Potent binding in this system is the result of a proper ( trigonal ) orientation rather than being directly proportional to the valency . The three way junction pieces of DNA were also conjugated to lactose moieties and applied in the binding of the lectin RCA 120 , a galactose specific lectin with two binding sites separated by ca . 100 Å . In this case the presence of sugars in two of the three arms was suﬃcient to achieve optimal binding ( K d 1 m M ) , in line with a chelation mechanism Fig . 6 X - ray structures of ConA 78 and of the ECL lectin 87 and their inhibitors / ligands . Chem Soc Rev Review Article This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Chem . Soc . Rev . , 2013 , 42 , 4492 - - 4503 4501 involving two RCA 120 binding sites . The possibility for long range chelation type multivalency eﬀects is also supported by the work of Seitz and coworkers on PNA – DNA hybrids , 82 , 83 a method pioneered also by the groups of Kobayashi 84 and Winssinger . 85 Seitz et al . hybridized several sections of PNA containing a LacNAc ligand onto a DNA template thus creating a series of low valent systems ( valency 1 – 4 ) with diﬀerent distances between the ligands . An example is the divalent 34 . The dimeric Erythrina cristagalli lectin ( ECL ) target contains two binding sites spaced ca . 100 Å apart , when taking the curvature of the protein into consideration . In SPR binding studies the best divalent complex 34 bound the lectin with a K d of ca . 10 m M , which represents an 80 - fold potency increase ( 40 - fold per sugar ) , an impressive result for such a long distance with such a low valency . The distance between the sugars was found to be optimal at ca . 104 Å , but the system was relatively forgiving in this respect . Increasing the flexibility of the systems was actually beneficial for the binding . Due to the lectin surface curvature the DNA – PNA scaﬀold complex needs to be able to bend somewhat to reach both binding sites . Recently Seeberger and coworkers used a DNA double helix to position two copies of the Lewis X saccharide at a fixed distance ( 34 Å ) . 86 This presentation enabled binding to mMGL1 - Fc , a mouse C - type lectin on antigen presenting cells , although no quantification of the binding eﬀects were reported . It is clear that longer distances can be bridged by molecules with the right dimen - sions and rigidity . DNA and DNA – PNA hybrids are particularly useful because their architecture allows relatively precise place - ment of the sugars , although naturally not all distances can be generated . The latter issue can be overcome with a flexible link between the DNA or PNA scaﬀold and the carbohydrate ligand . Potency enhancements reported so far are more moderate than those covering shorter distances . There should be other types of molecules with a fixed conformation and suﬃcient solubility to explore these challenges further . 8 . Conclusions Over the years many advances have been reported with respect to the potency enhancements that were achievable with multi - valent carbohydrates . We here mostly wrote on the chelation based advances but one can never do this exclusively as rebinding phenomena can also occur and additional aggrega - tion phenomena may complicate matters . Nevertheless chela - tion is a clear goal to aim for as was shown in many cases . In fact with the advent of the X - ray structures and the EPR - based analysis performed for WGA there should not be any doubt that it was operational for this lectin . Architectures and spacers play an important role . The spacers bridging the binding sites have historically been very long and flexible and their lengths were ideally in line with the Flory radius . Since this puts a limitation on achieving larger systems , more rigid well - defined systems have appeared based on glucose – triazole alternations for the medium size ranged or those based on nucleic acids ( incl . PNA ) to bridge distances of around 100 Å . In other words well - defined spacers are needed to achieve longer distances and do so with the highest potency enhancements . As far as the architecture is concerned , a system containing residues capable of acting as hinges is clearly capable of adjusting its size and can therefore be a potent inhibitor , however , when we are aiming at in vivo applications , selectivity is a very important aspect , and more well - defined systems need to be developed to bridge specific distances . To some extent this has been shown , but a lot more is possible . There is no limit to the imagination of the synthetic chemist so thrilling future examples may be anticipated .
