Abstract 11 The impact of variable infection risk by race and ethnicity on the dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 spread 12 is largely unknown . Here , we ﬁt structured compartmental models to seroprevalence data from New 13 York State and analyze how herd immunity thresholds ( HITs ) , ﬁnal sizes , and epidemic risk changes 14 across racial and ethnic groups . A proportionate mixing model reduced the overall HIT , but more 15 realistic levels of assortative mixing increased the threshold . Across all models , the burden of in - 16 fection fell disproportionately on minority populations : in an assortative mixing model ﬁt to Long Is - 17 land census data , 80 % of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT is reached compared to 18 33 % of non - Hispanic whites . Our ﬁndings , which are meant to be illustrative and not best estimates , 19 demonstrate how racial and ethnic disparities can impact epidemic trajectories and result in a dis - 20 proportionate distribution of the burden of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 21 2 .

This is especially 23 true for herd immunity , which occurs when susceptible individuals in a population are indirectly pro - 24 tected from infection due to immunity in others . The herd immunity threshold ( HIT ) is the fraction of 25 the population that is non - susceptible when the epidemic reaches its peak , and estimating the HIT 26 for SARS - CoV - 2 is important for forecasting the cost associated with letting the epidemic spread 27 in the absence of interventions [ 1 ] . In a population with homogeneous mixing , the HIT is 1 - 1 / R 0 , 28 where R 0 is the basic reproduction number ; this translates to an HIT of 66 . 7 % using an R 0 of 3 . 29 However , population homogeneity is an unrealistic assumption , and models incorporating hetero - 30 geneity in social exposure and infection susceptibility ( deﬁned as the probability of infection given 31 exposure ) generally result in lowered HITs [ 2 – 6 ] . The key idea behind these models is that sub - 32 populations important for epidemic spread ( i . e . , those with substantially increased susceptibility or 33 exposure ) become infected – and thus develop immunity – early on in an epidemic’s course . Herd 34 immunity for the population overall is then achieved earlier because once these individuals are no 35 longer susceptible to infection , further epidemic spread is slowed . 36 Importantly , these models also imply that in locations where SARS - CoV - 2 has spread , there may 37 be demographic sub - populations with particularly high cumulative incidences of infection due to in - 38 creased exposure , susceptibility , or both . Seroprevalence studies can identify these sub - populations 39 and are more reliable and unbiased than reported case data [ 7 ] . Identifying and building structured 40 models with these groups in mind is important for understanding how variation in exposure or sus - 41 ceptibility and social disparities are interconnected . These models are also useful for designing 42 interventions that can both reduce disparities and disrupt overall transmission by focusing efforts 43 on groups affected by high transmission rates [ 8 , 9 ] . Many models in this space have incorporated 44 subpopulation structure by accounting for transmission variation by age [ 3 , 10 , 11 ] . Supporting this 45 approach , susceptibility to infection , contact rates , and cumulative incidence in some locations all 46 appear to vary by age [ 10 , 12 ] . Nonetheless , serosurveys in Belgium , Spain , Iran , New York City , 47 Brazil , and other places exhibit relatively low variation in seropositivity by age [ 13 – 17 ] , indicating 48 additional factors that govern transmission spread . 49 Substantial racial and ethnic disparities in infection rates , hospitalizations , and deaths have been 50 characterized across the US [ 18 – 24 ] , but it is unclear how these heterogeneities in risk are expected 51 to change over time , and what implications – if any – they have on overall epidemic dynamics .

We focus 54 primarily on building and analyzing variable exposure models because observed disparities in in - 55 fection rates in US cities have been strongly attributed to differences in mobility and exposure [ 25 – 56 27 ] . Because of the challenges in acquiring racial and ethnic COVID - 19 data [ 28 ] , including social 57 contact data that can be used in transmission models , we analyzed a range of model structures 58 that are compatible with the seroprevalence data and analyze how those assumptions affect esti - 59 mates of the HIT and ﬁnal epidemic size . We also characterize which groups have the highest risk 60 for infection and how that changes over time . These results highlight the importance of developing 61 COVID - 19 transmission models that incorporate patterns of epidemic spread across racial and eth - 62 nic groups . 63 Methods 64 SEIR model 65 We initially modeled transmission dynamics in a homogeneous population using an SEIR compart - 66 mental SARS - CoV - 2 infection model : 67 dS dt = − βIS ( 1 ) 68 dE dt = βIS − rE ( 2 ) 69 dI dt = rE − γI ( 3 ) 70 dR dt = γI ( 4 ) where S , E , I , R refer to the number of people in susceptible , latently infected , infectious , and recov - 71 ered compartments respectively . Given a mean incubation period and mean serial interval of 5 days 72 as suggested by empirical studies [ 29 , 30 ] , we set the mean latent period 1 / r to be 3 days to allow 73 for pre - symptomatic transmission and the mean infectious period 1 / γ to be 4 days to coincide with 74 the observed serial interval . The per capita transmission rate is given by β = R 0 γ / N , where N is 75 the total number of people in the population . The herd immunity threshold ( HIT ) was deﬁned as the 76 fraction of non - susceptible people when for some time t , the instantaneous reproductive number 77 4 .

In matrix form , the structured SEIR model is given by : 82 d S dt = − ( BI ) ◦ S ( 5 ) 83 d E dt = ( BI ) ◦ S − r E ( 6 ) 84 d I dt = r E − γ I ( 7 ) 85 d R dt = γ I ( 8 ) where ◦ denotes element - wise multiplication and S , E , I , R are column vectors comprising the com - 86 partmental variables for each group ( e . g . , S = [ S 0 , . . . , S p ] T for p demographic groups ) . We let S 0 de - 87 note non - Hispanic whites , S 1 denote Hispanics or Latinos , S 2 denote non - Hispanic African - Americans , 88 S 3 denote non - Hispanic Asians , and S 4 denote multiracial or other demographic groups , with similar 89 ordering for elements in vectors E through R . 90 Following the convention for age - structured transmission models [ 31 ] , we deﬁned the p × p per 91 capita social contact matrix C to consist of elements c i ← j at row i and column j , representing the 92 per capita rate that individuals from group i are contacted by individuals of group j . Letting N i be 93 the total number of individuals in group i , the social contact matrix M consists of elements m i ← j = 94 c i ← j ∗ N i , which represents the average number of individuals in group i encountered by an individ - 95 ual in group j . The susceptibility to infection can vary between groups , which we modeled by allow - 96 ing the probability of infection given contact with an infected individual to vary : q = [ q 0 , . . . , q p ] T . The 97 transmission matrix B is then given by ( q 1 T ) ◦ C , where 1 T is a 1 by p vector of 1s : 98 B =   q 0 . . . q 0 . . . q 0 . . . . . . . . . q 4 . . . q 4 . . . q 4   ◦   c 0 ← 0 . . . c 0 ← 2 . . . c 0 ← 4 . . . . . . . . . c 4 ← 0 . . . c 4 ← 2 . . . c 4 ← 4   ( 9 ) Given mean duration of infectiousness 1 / γ , the next - generation matrix G , representing the average 99 number of infections in group i caused by an infected individual in group j , is given by ( q 1 T ) ◦ M / γ . 100 5 .

To hold R 0 values across model 103 types constant , we re - scaled transmission matrices to have the same dominant eigenvalue . We also 104 calculated the instantaneous incidence rate of infection at some time t for all groups by calculating 105 the force of infection λ ( t ) = ( BI ( t ) ) ◦ S ( t ) . 106 Structured model variants 107 Simplifying assumptions are needed to constrain the number of variables to estimate in B given 108 limited data . Under the variable susceptibility model , we set the contact rates c i ← j to all be 1 , in - 109 dicating no heterogeneity in exposure , but allowed the q j in the susceptibility vector to vary ( i . e . , 110 B = q 1 T ) . 111 Under each of two variable exposure models , in contrast , we set the susceptibility factors q j to be 112 equal . The simplest variable exposure model we analyzed was the proportionate mixing model , 113 which assumes that the contact rate for each pair of groups is proportional to the size and activity 114 level ( i . e . , total number of contacts per unit time ) of the two groups [ 32 ] . Denoting a i as the activ - 115 ity level for a member of group i and a as the 1 × p vector of a i s , the ij th entry in the transmission 116 matrix is given by : 117 β i ← j = q a i a j (cid:80) k a k N k ( 10 ) and the overall transmission matrix B can be written as : 118 B = q (cid:80) k a k N k aa T ( 11 ) Finally , under the assortative mixing assumption , we extended this model by partitioning a fraction 119 (cid:15) of contacts to be exclusively within - group and distributed the rest of the contacts according to pro - 120 portionate mixing ( with δ i , j being an indicator variable that is 1 when i = j and 0 otherwise ) : 121 β i ← j = ( 1 − (cid:15) ) q a i a j (cid:80) k a k N k + (cid:15)δ i , j q a i N i ( 12 ) 122 B = ( 1 − (cid:15) ) q (cid:80) k a k N k aa T + (cid:15)q diag ( a ◦ 1 / N ) ( 13 ) Model ﬁtting and data sources 123 6 .

We estimated 124 the a i in the variable exposure models and the q i in the variable susceptibility models using max - 125 imum likelihood ﬁts to seroprevalence data from New York , which was collected from over 15 , 000 126 adults in grocery stores from April 19 - 28th [ 16 ] . We assumed that the seroprevalence data were 127 collected via a binomial sampling process : at a given time point t s representing the time of the sero - 128 survey , the number of seropositive cases Y i ( t s ) in group i is distributed Bin ( m i , R i ( t s ) / N i ( t s ) ) , where 129 m i is the number of people tested from group i in the serosurvey and R i / N i is the fraction of recov - 130 ered people from the SEIR model . The likelihood was calculated jointly for all demographic groups , 131 with t s set to 100 days and the initial number of infected individuals set to 1 in each demographic 132 group ; see Supplementary Information for sensitivity analyses on these assumptions . 133 We acquired total population numbers ( i . e . N i for i ∈ { 0 , . . . , 4 } ) from the 2018 ACS census 1 - year 134 estimates Table B03002 ( Hispanic or Latino origin by race ) subsetted to the following counties : 135 Bronx , Kings , New York , Queens , and Richmond Counties for New York City and Nassau and Suf - 136 folk Counties for Long Island . For exposure index calculations to inform model assortativity lev - 137 els , we used the approach of Richardson et al . [ 33 ] using census data from the 2018 ACS 5 - year 138 estimates Table B03002 ( Hispanic or Latino origin by race ) at the level of “all block groups” within 139 the above counties . Copies of the census data we used are available at https : / / github . com / 140 kevincma / covid19 - race - ethnicity - model / tree / main / data . The exposure index P a , b between 141 two demographic groups a and b was deﬁned as in [ 34 ] : 142 P a , b = L (cid:88) i (cid:18) N a , i N a (cid:19) (cid:18) N b , i T i (cid:19) ( 14 ) where L is the number of census block groups , N j , i is the number of people from demographic 143 group j in census block i , N j is the total number of people from demographic group j across the 144 city , and T i is the total number of people in census block group i . The interpretation is that the aver - 145 age a individual lives in a neighborhood with P a , b ∗ 100 % of people from demographic group b . To ﬁt 146 (cid:15) , we reasoned that if all activity levels a i were equal to 1 , the social contact matrix M a = 1 ( compris - 147 ing elements m i ← j , a = 1 = c i ← j , a = 1 ∗ N i = ( 1 − (cid:15) ) N i (cid:80) k N k + (cid:15)δ i , j ) should also reﬂect the composition of the 148 average neighborhood . Using this equivalency , we identiﬁed the value of (cid:15) that minimized the differ - 149 ence between the social contact and exposure index matrices , weighted by the population fraction 150 of each demographic group : 151 7 .

Models incorporating variable susceptibility to COVID - 19 are commonly 160 used when stratifying by age because children are thought to have decreased susceptibility to in - 161 fection [ 10 ] . Variable susceptibility to infection across racial and ethnic groups has been less well 162 characterized , and observed disparities in infection rates can already be largely explained by differ - 163 ences in mobility and exposure [ 25 – 27 ] , likely attributable to social factors such as structural racism 164 that have put racial and ethnic minorities in disadvantaged positions [ 35 – 38 ] . In line with the notion 165 that variation in exposure could instead be the main driver of observed seroprevalence differences , 166 our primary focus is on analyzing variable exposure models ; we have also analyzed variable sus - 167 ceptibility models for comparison ( see Supplementary Information ) . 168 The simplest variable exposure models assume proportionate mixing , where the contact rate be - 169 tween groups is set to be proportional to the size and activity level ( i . e . , mean number of contacts 170 per time period ) of the two groups [ 32 ] . We ﬁt proportionate mixing models allowing for variable ac - 171 tivity levels across racial and ethnic demographic groups to serosurvey data collected in late - April 172 from New York City ( NYC ) and Long Island , comprising 5946 and 2074 adults , respectively [ 16 ] . 173 The serosurvey data were compatible with proportionate mixing models in which Hispanics or Lati - 174 nos , non - Hispanic Black people , non - Hispanic Asians , and multiracial or other people had 2 . 25 , 175 1 . 62 , 0 . 86 , and 1 . 28 times the activity level relative to non - Hispanic whites in NYC . Model ﬁts to 176 Long Island resulted in even more pronounced exposure differences because of greater between - 177 group differences in seropositivity ( e . g . , the seropositivity in Hispanics or Latinos relative to non - 178 8 .

Variable exposure models were ﬁtted to NYC and Long Island serosurvey data . Hispanic whites was 1 . 85 times higher in Long Island than in NYC ) ; Hispanics or Latinos , non - Hispanic 179 Black people , non - Hispanic Asians , and multiracial or other people had 4 . 31 , 1 . 96 , 0 . 92 , and 2 . 48 180 times the activity level relative to non - Hispanic whites in Long Island , respectively . These differ - 181 ences in exposure impacted herd immunity levels and ﬁnal epidemic sizes relative to the homo - 182 geneous model across a range of R 0 values ( Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 5 ) , and are in 183 line with theoretical derivations ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . For example , for an R 0 of 3 , the HIT de - 184 creases to 58 % in NYC and 40 % in Long Island , compared to 67 % under the homogeneous model . 185 The HIT overall is reached after cumulative incidence has disproportionately increased in certain 186 minority groups : at the HIT , 75 % of Hispanics or Latinos and 63 % of non - Hispanic Black people 187 were infected compared to 46 % of non - Hispanic whites in NYC , and 77 % of Hispanics or Latinos 188 and 48 % of non - Hispanic Black people were infected compared to 29 % of non - Hispanic whites in 189 Long Island ( Figure 2 ) . 190 The estimated activity ratios indicate higher activity levels for minority groups such as Hispanics or 191 Latinos and non - Hispanic Black people , which is in line with studies using cell phone mobility data 192 [ 25 ] , but the magnitudes of the activity level ratios are substantially higher than expected . This may 193 reﬂect some of the limitations of the proportionate mixing assumption , which does not allow for pref - 194 erential within - group contacts and hence must ﬁt observed seropositivity differences solely by scal - 195 ing activity levels . To address this , we augment our model by partitioning a speciﬁed fraction (cid:15) of 196 9 .

The HIT for the population is indicated with a gray dashed line . contacts to be exclusively within - group , with the remaining contacts distributed proportionately . This 197 assortative mixing model captures more realistic patterns of interactions due to neighborhood struc - 198 ture . After ﬁtting the models across a range of (cid:15) values , we observed that as (cid:15) increases , HITs and 199 epidemic ﬁnal sizes shifted higher back towards the homogeneous case ( Figure 1 , Supplementary 200 Figure 5 ) . This observation can be understood by comparing the epidemic cumulative incidence tra - 201 jectories ( Supplementary Figure 6 ) and next - generation matrices ( Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 ) : 202 under proportionate mixing ( (cid:15) = 0 ) , lower - risk demographic groups are protected from further infec - 203 tion due to built - up immunity in higher - risk demographic groups , but the magnitude of this indirect 204 protection decreases as the proportion of exclusively within - group contacts increases and groups 205 become more isolated . 206 We assessed a range of values for (cid:15) because the serosurvey data cannot be used to also ﬁt the 207 optimal (cid:15) value ; given limited numbers of data points , all of the models can ﬁt exactly to the single 208 seroprevalence time point we consider . To inform plausible assortativity levels , we instead used ad - 209 ditional data on demographic distributions from the American Community Survey US census [ 33 ] . 210 We calculated the exposure index , which represents the average neighborhood’s demographic com - 211 10 .

The exposure index describes contacts based on 213 proximity but may not capture contacts in other settings , such as work , beyond one’s immediate 214 neighborhood of residence . The census data were compatible with assortative mixing matrices in 215 which 43 % and 32 % of contacts were exclusively within - group in NYC and Long Island , respec - 216 tively ( Supplementary Figure 7 ) . After ﬁtting to seroprevalence data using these optimal (cid:15) levels , 217 we observed that the groups with higher activity levels remained the same as under proportionate 218 mixing , but the magnitudes of differences were now lower and more concordant with reported mo - 219 bility differences [ 25 ] : model estimates indicated Hispanics or Latinos , non - Hispanic Black people , 220 non - Hispanic Asians , and multiracial or other people had 1 . 65 , 1 . 37 , 0 . 90 , and 1 . 18 times the ac - 221 tivity level relative to non - Hispanic whites in NYC , respectively , and 2 . 85 , 1 . 70 , 0 . 93 , and 2 times 222 the activity level relative to non - Hispanic whites in Long Island , respectively . For an epidemic with 223 R 0 = 3 , the HITs for NYC and Long Island using these census - informed assortativity values were 224 60 % and 44 % , respectively . Similar to the other models , at the HIT , 76 % of Hispanics or Latinos and 225 66 % of non - Hispanic Black people were infected compared to 49 % of non - Hispanic whites in NYC , 226 and 80 % of Hispanics or Latinos and 54 % of non - Hispanic Black people were infected compared to 227 33 % of non - Hispanic whites in Long Island ( Figure 2 ) . 228 Using these census - informed assortative mixing models , we then considered how the relative in - 229 cidence rates of infection in demographic groups could change over the course of the epidemic . 230 Early comparisons of infection and mortality rates have helped to identify racial and ethnic groups 231 at high risk and the risk factors for infection [ 18 – 24 ] , but these studies often rely on cross - sectional 232 snapshots of epidemiological patterns . The challenge is that these metrics can change over time : 233 for instance , county level correlations of monthly incidence and mortality rates with percent peo - 234 ple of color rose and fell in multiple regions as the epidemic progressed [ 39 ] . The reasons for these 235 changes are multifaceted , but even independent of the effect of interventions or behavioral changes , 236 models of epidemic spread in structured populations imply that incidence rate ratios for high - risk 237 groups can decrease substantially as the epidemic progresses because of depletion of susceptible 238 individuals from these groups [ 40 , 41 ] . In line with this , we observe that instantaneous incidence 239 rate ratios are elevated initially in high - activity groups relative to non - Hispanic whites , but this trend 240 reverses after the epidemic has peaked – a consequence of the fact that a majority of individuals 241 have already become infected ( Figure 3 ) . Similarly , cumulative incidence ratios remain elevated in 242 high - activity racial and ethnic groups throughout the epidemic , but the magnitude decreases as the 243 11 .

These results highlight the importance of control - 244 ling for dynamics - induced changes in epidemiological measures of disease burden when evaluating 245 the impact of interventions for reducing inequities in SARS - CoV - 2 infections [ 42 ] ; otherwise , inef - 246 fective interventions – depending on their timing – might still be associated with declines in relative 247 measures of disease burden . 248 Discussion 249 Here , we explored how incorporating heterogeneity in SARS - CoV - 2 spread across racial and eth - 250 nic groups could affect epidemic dynamics using deterministic transmission models . Models incor - 251 porating variable exposure generally decreased the HIT and ﬁnal epidemic size , but incorporating 252 preferential within - group contacts shifted HITs and ﬁnal epidemic sizes higher , approaching the ho - 253 mogeneous case . Epidemiological measures of disease burden such as incidence rate ratios and 254 cumulative incidence ratios also changed substantially over the course of the epidemic , highlighting 255 the need to account for these trends when evaluating interventions [ 42 ] . These results illustrate the 256 varied effects of different structured heterogeneity models , but are not meant to be best estimates 257 given the limited seroprevalence data . Longitudinal serosurveys in this same population or incorpo - 258 rating additional data such as cell - phone mobility and social contact surveys [ 25 , 43 ] could help to 259 12 .

The estimated activity level differences concord with 264 reports that frontline workers , who are unable to engage in physical or social distancing to the same 265 degree as other types of workers , are disproportionately from minority backgrounds [ 25 , 27 , 46 ] . 266 The assortativity we observed in the census data has root causes in many areas , including resi - 267 dential segregation arising from a long history of discriminatory practices [ 44 , 47 ] . All of these fac - 268 tors highlight the fact that incorporating heterogeneity in models in a mechanism - free manner can 269 conceal the disparities that underlie changes in epidemic ﬁnal sizes and HITs . In particular , overall 270 lower HIT and ﬁnal sizes occur because certain groups suffer not only more infection than average , 271 but more infection than under a homogeneous mixing model ; incorporating heterogeneity lowers the 272 HIT but increases it for the highest - risk groups ( Figure 2 ) . 273 These results also suggest that public health interventions for reducing COVID - 19 inequities can 274 have synergistic effects for controlling the overall epidemic [ 33 ] . For instance , from a transmission - 275 control perspective , age - structured models indicate that vaccination of high - activity age groups – 276 such as young adults – is optimal for controlling the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 9 ] . Similar interven - 277 tions could be explored for disadvantaged populations because of how increased exposure under - 278 lies much of the higher infection risk that racial and ethnic minorities experience . Policy proposals 279 in this space should , of course , carefully consider the ethical dimensions of vaccinations or other 280 interventions targeted by race or ethnicity [ 48 ] . 281 We note several limitations with this study . First , biases in the serosurvey sampling process can 282 substantially affect downstream results ; any conclusions drawn depend heavily on the degree to 283 which serosurvey design and post - survey adjustments yield representative samples [ 49 ] . Other 284 sources of uncertainty , such as antibody test sensitivity and speciﬁcity , could also be incorporated 285 into epidemic model predictions in future work [ 50 ] . Second , we have assumed that seropositiv - 286 ity implies complete immunity and that immunity does not wane . These are strong assumptions 287 that can be revisited as empirical studies on the length of natural immunity are conducted . Third , 288 we have for simplicity modeled an unmitigated epidemic , where overall transmission rates ( per in - 289 fected and susceptible individual ) remain constant , and individual group - speciﬁc rates do as well . 290 13 .

Empirical evidence suggests that during periods of lockdown , 293 certain neighborhoods that are disproportionately wealthy and white tend to show greater declines 294 in mobility than others [ 27 , 51 ] . These simplifying assumptions were made to aid in illustrating the 295 key ﬁndings of this model , but for more detailed predictive models , the extent to which activity level 296 differences change can be evaluated using mobility data and longitudinal survey data [ 25 , 43 ] . 297 In summary , we have explored how deterministic transmission models can be extended to study the 298 dynamics of infection in racial and ethnic groups , and how the impact of heterogeneity on the HIT 299 and ﬁnal epidemic size can depend strongly on the details of how heterogeneity is modeled . We 300 have shown that measures of impact may decline and even reverse over the course of the epidemic 301 due to early increased burden of infection in individuals from the most at - risk groups , even in the 302 absence of interventions to reduce inequities . These results describe a framework that can be ex - 303 tended to other cities and countries in which racial and ethnic disparities in seropositivity have been 304 observed [ 17 , 52 ] and are a step towards using transmission models to design policy interventions 305 for reducing disparities in COVID - 19 and other diseases . 306 14 .

As with variable exposure models , these differences in suscep - 318 tibility lowered herd immunity levels and ﬁnal epidemic sizes relative to the homogeneous model 319 ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) , but to a lesser extent ; for instance , variable susceptibility models resulted 320 in HITs ∼ 10 % greater than HITs under proportionate mixing for Long Island . 321 The difference between these models is that incorporating heterogeneity in susceptibility only af - 322 fects susceptible individuals , but heterogeneity in activity levels impacts both susceptible and infec - 323 tious individuals : individuals from racial and ethnic groups with high activity levels are both more 324 likely to be infected , and when infected , to infect a greater number of secondary cases . This con - 325 trast is clear when comparing the next - generation matrices for each model , which lists the average 326 number of secondary infections caused by an infected individual from a given demographic group 327 ( Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 ) . The epidemic resolves at an earlier stage in variable exposure 328 models once these key transmission groups become immune because of this additional compound 329 effect on transmission . 330 Our results contrasting mechanistic variable exposure and susceptibility models are in line with the - 331 oretical studies , which also indicate that models incorporating heterogeneity in exposure have more 332 pronounced effects on HITs than models incorporating heterogeneity in susceptibility , assuming 333 comparable continuous distributions of exposure and susceptibility [ 4 , 6 ] . Tkachenko et al . showed 334 that the HIT = 1 − ( 1 / R 0 ) ( 1 / λ ) , where λ is either 1 + CV 2 for variable susceptibility models or 335 1 + CV 2 ( 2 + γ s CV ) / ( 1 + CV 2 ) for variable exposure models , and CV is the coefﬁcient of varia - 336 tion and γ s is the skewness for the exposure distribution [ 6 ] . We calculated CV and skewness using 337 the susceptibility and activity ratios and substituted those values into the HIT formula , which is an 338 approximation because our exposure and susceptibility distributions are discrete ; nonetheless , the 339 approximations result in similar HIT curves to the simulation results ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . 340 Sensitivity analyses 341 16 .

Varying 343 the timing of epidemic start did not substantially affect HIT estimates , as long as the time between 344 epidemic start and serosurvey t s was reasonable large ( e . g . , > 20 days ) and assortativity was low 345 ( (cid:15) < 0 . 8 ) ( Supplementary Figure 9 ) . The distribution and number of initial infected individuals also 346 did not substantially affect HIT estimates for low levels of assortativity ( (cid:15) < 0 . 8 ) ( Supplementary 347 Figures 10 and 11 ) .
