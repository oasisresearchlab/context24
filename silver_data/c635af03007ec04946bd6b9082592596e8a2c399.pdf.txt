Abstract Clathrin assembles at the cells ’ plasma membrane in a multitude of clathrin - coated structures ( CCSs ) . Among these are flat clathrin lattices ( FCLs ) , alternative clathrin structures that have been found in specific cell types , including cancer cells . Here we show that these structures are also present in different colorectal cancer ( CRC ) cell lines , and that they are extremely stable with lifetimes longer than 8 hours . By combining cell models representative of CRC metastasis with advanced fluorescence imaging and analysis , we discovered that the metastatic potential of CRC is associated with an aberrant membranous clathrin distribution , resulting in a higher prevalence of FCLs in cells with a higher metastatic potential . These findings suggest that clathrin organization might play an important yet unexplored role in cancer metastasis . Introduction Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is essential for the selective internalization of cell surface receptors in mammalian cells . The main actor in this process is clathrin , a triskelion - shaped protein consisting of three heavy and three light chains , which binds cargo molecules at the plasma membrane . Through the recruitment of additional triskelions , a honeycomb - like lattice consisting of hexagons and pentagons assembles . According to the CME model for de novo vesicle formation , this lattice can form a shallow invagination called clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) . Assisted by adaptor proteins , a CCP can bend further , increasing its curvature and the depth of the invagination , until a spherical clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) is released into the intracellular environment . In agreement with the general CME outline , a variety of clathrin - coated structures ( CCSs ) have been observed , ranging from nearly planar lattices or slightly curved CCPs to domed structures or highly curved CCVs ( 1 ) . However , alternative clathrin structures that do not fit this model have also been described , including flat clathrin lattices ( FCLs , also termed clathrin plaques ) ( 2 – 6 ) . These structures are reported to be planar , heterogeneous and irregularly shaped non - classical CCSs that are too large to be resolved into a single diffraction - limited CCV ( 2 – 6 ) . FCLs are functional endocytic structures that can release CCVs ( 4 , 7 – 9 ) , but are more stable : while classical CCSs remain at the plasma membrane for about 30 - 90 seconds ( 10 – 12 ) , FCLs are significantly longer - lived , with reported lifetimes ranging 2 from 2 - 10 minutes to more than 1 hour ( 5 , 6 , 13 ) . FCLs have exclusively been found in specific cell types , including several cancer cell lines ( 6 , 14 ) , but a potential link between the presence of non - classical CCSs and cancer progression has not yet been investigated . Previous research has shown that endocytosis is dysregulated in cancer ( 15 – 18 ) and that several proteins involved in CME are implicated in tumor cell migration , invasion and metastasis ( 19 ) . By using subcellular proteomic analysis , we have previously established that proteins involved in vesicle trafficking , including in CME , are among the most dysregulated complexes in highly metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) cells compared to poorly metastatic CRC cells ( 20 , 21 ) . In this work , we combined two isogenic cell models representative of CRC metastasis ( KM12 and SW ) with advanced fluorescence imaging to investigate whether cellular clathrin distribution is related to metastatic potential . The KM12 model consists of the poorly metastatic KM12C cell line obtained from a patient ’s primary CRC tumor , and the liver metastatic KM12SM and liver and lung metastatic KM12L4a cell lines , obtained through successive passages in nude mice ( 22 , 23 ) . The second model ( namely SW ) consists of the SW480 and SW620 pair of cell lines . The poorly metastatic SW480 cell line was obtained from a patient ’s primary CRC tumor and the metastatic SW620 cell line was derived from lymph node metastasis in the same patient ( 24 , 25 ) . Previous research reported a good correlation between findings in these cell models and patient samples ( 21 , 26 – 32 ) , indicating that they quite adequately mimic the different subtypes of CRC patients and the critical steps of CRC metastasis . We investigated clathrin organization and dynamics using standard confocal microscopy , and we quantified detailed clathrin topology using super - resolution PALM - TIRF microscopy and customized analysis algorithms . Our results show that extremely stable alternative CCSs , identified as FCLs , are far more prevalent in highly metastatic cells compared to their poorly metastatic counterparts . This suggests that aberrant clathrin organization could potentially be a key player in the process of cancer metastasis . Results 1 . Stable FCLs are present in metastatic CRC cells To investigate whether alternative CCSs are present in the KM12 cell model , we imaged the clathrin distribution at the ventral membrane of cells transiently transfected with clathrin light chain A fused to EYFP ( EYFP - CLTA ) . Confocal images indicate that poorly and highly metastatic cells display remarkable differences in clathrin topology ( Fig 1 ) . In the poorly metastatic KM12C cell line , clathrin predominantly appears as diffraction - limited dot - like structures , representing classical CCSs that fit the general CME model . In comparison , the two metastatic KM12SM and KM12L4a cell lines present an aberrant clathrin organization with both classical CCSs as well as larger , more elongated CCSs with longitudinal cross - sections reaching a few micrometers , which resemble FCLs . Previous reports have shown that transient overexpression of the CLTA plasmid does not influence clathrin topology ( 33 ) , and our results support this finding since immunolabeling of endogenous clathrin heavy chain 1 ( CLTC ) resulted in a comparable topology ( Fig S1 ) . 3 Figure 1 : Clathrin topology imaged with confocal fluorescence microscopy . Representative images of transiently transfected EYFP - CLTA visualized at the ventral plasma membrane ( bottom , in contact with the glass coverslip ) of poorly metastatic KM12C ( i ) , metastatic KM12SM ( ii ) and metastatic KM12L4a ( iii ) CRC cells . Scale bars 5 µm . To confirm that the observed elongated CCSs are indeed FCLs , we monitored clathrin dynamics in metastatic KM12SM cells for longer time intervals . As shown in Figure 2A , classical dot - like CCSs are typically formed and internalized within 1 - 2 minutes , in line with their dynamic behavior during CME . In contrast , nearly all alternative CCSs remained present for longer periods of time and could still be observed after 8 hours in both the metastatic KM12SM and KM12L4a cell lines ( Fig 2B and Fig S2 ) . This extended lifetime supports the conclusion that these structures are FCLs . However , to the best of our knowledge , imaging of clathrin in FCLs for such prolonged periods of time has not yet been reported . Figure 2 : Clathrin dynamics at the ventral membrane of metastatic KM12SM cells transiently transfected with EYFP - CLTA , imaged by time - lapse confocal microscopy for 20 minutes ( A ) or 8 hours ( B ) . First ( i ) and last ( ii ) timepoint of the time - lapse are shown , as well as the temporal color - coded image of the entire time - lapse ( iii ) . CCSs that were present for a limited amount of time are shown in a single color from the color code ( yellow arrows ) , while CCSs that were present for a longer time or persisted for the whole duration of the measurement are shown in the overlay color ( white arrows ) . Scale bars 5 µm , except scale bars of enlargements 1 µm . 2 . Divergent clathrin topology can be quantified in single - molecule localization microscopy To accurately quantify the distribution of clathrin and avoid erroneous interpretation of CCSs located closely to each other , we visualized clathrin topology ( mEos3 . 2 - CLTA ) using PALM - TIRF single - molecule localization microscopy ( SMLM ) ( Fig 3i - ii ) . We selected TIRF illumination since it eliminates the background fluorescence signal from the cytoplasm , allowing for more precise visualization of membrane - associated protein organization ( Fig S3 ) . Consistent with our confocal 4 results , we detected predominantly classical CCSs in the poorly metastatic KM12C cells , and a mix of classical CCSs and alternative FCLs in the metastatic KM12 cells ( Fig 4Ai - iii and Fig S4i - iii ) . Of note , subtle discrepancies were also present within the same cell line ( Fig S5A - B ) . To quantify the apparent differences between poorly and highly metastatic cells , we developed a two - step analysis workflow to identify and classify clathrin clusters as classical CCSs or alternative FCLs ( Fig 3 ) , leveraging the single - molecule information content of the SMLM imaging strategy . Figure 3 : Cluster identification and classification workflow illustrated in a metastatic KM12L4a cell . Individual localizations ( ii ) that make up the PALM - TIRF image ( i ) were clustered using the DBSCAN algorithm with minimum 17 neighbors ( MinPts ) and search radius ( ε ) 0 . 55 . Retaining clusters with ≥ 50 localizations resulted in identification of individual clathrin clusters ( iii ) . The designed cluster classification model ( iv - v ) classifies these as either a classical CCS ( blue , indicated as CCP ) or an alternative FCL ( pink ) based on 5 cluster - specific parameters ( cluster area , number of localizations NrPts , eccentricity , perimeter , and the distance to the nearest neighboring cluster MinDistance ) and a global threshold . Scale bars 5 µm , except scale bars of enlargements 1 µm . For cluster identification , we applied DBSCAN density - based clustering that is capable of detecting clusters in a noisy dataset without making assumptions about their shape or size ( 34 , 35 ) . After optimizing DBSCAN cluster parameters ( MinPts and ε , Fig S6Aiii ) , and after discarding clusters with less than 50 localizations ( corresponding to single clathrin molecules rather than a CCS , Fig S6B ) , the DBSCAN algorithm correctly identified individual clathrin clusters ( Fig 3iii ) . For cluster topology classification , different CCS characteristics such as cluster area , brightness and roundness have previously been applied ( 4 , 6 , 9 , 36 , 37 ) . However , there seems to be a lack of unambiguous guidelines for parameter selection , so that different strategies rely on different CCS characteristics . Therefore , we designed a classification model that integrates multiple relevant CCS characteristics and considers – besides cluster area , brightness and roundness – the circumference and the distance to the nearest neighboring cluster . We found that these two additional parameters were effective in distinguishing between divergent CCSs ( Fig S6C - D ) . One advantage of our integrated model is that it can rely on a global threshold for the combined parameters ( Fig 3iv ) , rather than relying on threshold values for the individual parameters for which a consensus seems to be lacking in the literature . We set the global threshold based on an internal reference determined for 1247 classical and 1042 alternative CCSs that were manually selected , ensuring that maximally 10 % of the classical CCSs are misclassified . Using this automated analysis workflow ( see Materials and Methods section 8 ) we can quickly , accurately and objectively discriminate between classical and alternative clathrin topology in large SMLM datasets containing thousands of clusters ( Fig 3iv - v ) . 5 To evaluate the effectiveness of our classification strategy , we examined the area of classified CCSs ( Fig S6E ) , which is frequently used in the literature to identify alternative CCSs ( 4 , 6 , 9 , 36 , 37 ) . We found that the area of classical CCSs is cell - type independent for the KM12 cell model with an average area of 33 000 nm² ( corresponding to a diameter of 205 nm when assuming a spherically shaped CCS ) . These results are in line with projections from the general CME model and with previous reports ( 4 , 6 , 9 , 37 ) considering that the resolution of optical microscopy yields slightly larger values compared to higher - resolution techniques like electron microscopy . In addition , we observed that alternative FCLs have an average area of 191 333 nm² , which is in line with the > 100 000 nm² benchmark reported by Grove et al . ( 6 ) and is on average 5 . 79 times larger than a classical CCS . Unlike classical CCSs , FCL sizes vary significantly between the different cell lines , with larger FCLs associated to a higher metastatic potential . We also verified that cluster area is not correlated to cell area ( Fig S6F ) . Overall , the similarities between our results and recent findings support our cluster classification model for the quantification of clathrin clusters in a SMLM dataset . 3 . FCLs are associated to metastatic potential in two different CRC models , as quantified with single - molecule localization microscopy Having verified our analysis strategy , we quantified clathrin topology in the KM12 model by comparing the number of clusters classified as alternative FCLs with those classified as classical CCSs , where this ratio was calculated for each of the measured cells ( Fig 4B ) . We found that within a given KM12 cell , there are more classical CCSs than alternative FCLs since the ratio is lower than 1 . Importantly , this ratio is significantly higher for metastatic KM12 cells than for their poorly metastatic counterpart ( Fig 4B ) , which is due to a combination of significantly less classical CCSs and significantly more alternative FCLs ( Fig S7 ) . These results demonstrate that FCLs are associated with metastatic potential in the KM12 CRC model . To reinforce our findings , we extended our research to the SW model for CRC metastasis . Clathrin topology imaged by PALM - TIRF microscopy is strikingly similar to that in the KM12 model , with predominantly small dot - like classical CCSs in the poorly metastatic SW480 cells , and a combination of classical CCSs and large , elongated FCLs in the metastatic SW620 cells ( Fig 4Aiv - v and Fig S4iv - v ) . However , in the metastatic SW620 cells , clathrin seems to be reorganized even more extensively , since clathrin forms highly connected rosette - like structures that sometimes cover the entire ventral membrane with few classical CCSs present ( Fig S5C ) . When applying our classification model on the SW dataset , we validated again that classical CCS area is cell - type independent ( Fig S6E ) , and found that alternative FCLs are on average 5 . 82 times larger than classical CCSs . FCLs are significantly larger in the metastatic SW620 cell line compared to the poorly metastatic SW480 cell line ( Fig S6E ) , and cluster area is again independent of cell area ( Fig S6F ) . When quantifying clathrin topology in the SW model using the ratio of FCLs and classical CCSs ( Fig 4B ) , we found that most cells have more classical CCSs than alternative FCLs . The poorly metastatic cells of both cell models are not significantly different ( Fig 4B ) and have a similar percentage classical CCSs and a similar percentage alternative FCLs ( Fig S7 ) . The metastatic SW620 cells have a significantly higher ratio when compared to their poorly metastatic counterpart ( Fig 4B ) , and when compared to the metastatic cells of the KM12 model ( Fig 4B ) , in accordance with the rosette - like structures observed in the SW620 cells . In conclusion , FCLs are associated with metastatic potential in both KM12 and SW CRC cell models . 6 Figure 4 : Visualization and quantification of clathrin topology at the ventral membrane of poorly and highly metastatic cells of the KM12 and SW models .

B : Quantification of clathrin topology using the ratio of number of clusters classified as alternative FCLs versus classical CCSs per measured cell . Note that most cells have more classical CCSs than alternative FCLs ( ratio < 1 ) , except in 8 of the 35 SW620 cells . Data are plotted per cell line and the number of datapoints ( n ) and medians ( x͂ ) are provided . Statistical significances are shown on the plot ( * significant difference for p ≤ 0 . 05 ; * * significant difference for p ≤ 0 . 01 ; * * * significant difference for p ≤ 0 . 001 ; ns non - significant difference for p > 0 . 05 ) . 7 Since protein expression and cellular function are closely related , we set out to investigate whether the aberrant clathrin topology could be due to altered expression levels of certain CME actors . We quantified the expression of clathrin light chain A ( CLTA ) , clathrin heavy chain 1 ( CLTC ) and AP2 subunit α 2 ( AP2A2 , an adaptor protein involved in CME ) in the KM12 and SW models via Western blot ( Fig S8 ) . When comparing poorly and highly metastatic cells within the same cell model , we found that AP2A2 expression is downregulated in metastatic SW cells , while it is highly upregulated in metastatic KM12 cells , the latter as previously reported for this cell model ( 20 ) . In terms of clathrin expression , we found that both CLTA and CLTC protein levels either remain unchanged or are downregulated in metastatic KM12 cells , while an opposite trend was seen within the SW model ( CLTA is downregulated , but CLTC is upregulated in metastatic SW cells ) . Considering the differences between the KM12 and SW models , it is reasonable to assume that although alterations in CME actors might be inherent to CRC s’ metastatic progression , the exact changes may be associated to the different tropism of the cancer cells . It is noteworthy that clathrin protein expression does not seem to cause the aberrant clathrin topology observed in these cell lines , as one might intuitively expect . In addition , our results indicate that besides protein expression levels there must be additional factors influencing clathrin topology that converge to a similar phenotype albeit via different molecular mechanisms . Discussion In this report , we show for the first time an association between metastatic potential and membranous clathrin distribution in two isogenic cell models representative of CRC metastasis . Confocal imaging revealed that poorly metastatic cells predominantly display classical dot - like CCSs , while metastatic cells exhibit both classical CCSs and larger , more elongated CCSs that we identified as FCLs based on their reported topology and lifetime . We observed FCLs for more than 8 hours in our measurements , an extremely extended lifetime that has to the best of our knowledge not yet been reported . When quantifying detailed clathrin topology using advanced fluorescence microscopy , we found that FCLs can be detected in both highly and poorly metastatic CRC cells , but that they are far more prevalent in cells with a higher metastatic potential . While there is a clear link between metastatic potential and aberrant clathrin organization , the cause of FCL formation in these cell models remains an enigma since our analysis could not pinpoint the divergent topology to the expression of a specific CME component . It was previously reported that both AP2M1 expression levels and alternative splicing of CLTC can influence clathrin organization ( 37 , 38 ) , and therefore it could be that FCL formation cannot be attributed to one specific alteration . Instead , FCL formation may be cell type - specific or could depend on ( interaction with ) yet other proteins that were not analyzed here . For instance , there is growing evidence of an intimate relationship between FCLs and integrin αVβ5 - containing reticular adhesions ( 14 , 39 – 41 ) . Alternatively , mechanobiological cues could play a role in FCL formation , since an altered plasma membrane tension ( 12 ) and certain properties of the extracellular environment like rigidity and presentation of adhesion ligands ( 12 , 36 , 41 – 44 ) were reported to affect the presence of alternative CCSs . Given the role of FCLs as a platform for sustained receptor signaling and their connection to cell proliferation ( 6 , 8 , 9 , 36 ) , we hypothesize that alternative clathrin organization might be involved in cancer progression and metastasis . In addition , considering their close association with integrins and the extracellular matrix , these structures may be relevant to the migration of metastatic cancer cells during tumor dissemination . Further investigation of the link between metastatic potential and aberrant clathrin organization will contribute to unraveling the function of clathrin in tumor biology . 8 Author contributions C .
