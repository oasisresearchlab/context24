A first report from a living systematic review and meta - analysis . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2 ABSTRACT Health care workers ( HCWs ) are more than ten times more likely to be infected with COVID - 19 compared to the general population , thus demonstrating the burden of COVID - 19 among HCWs . Factors that expose HCWs to a differentially high - risk of COVID - 19 acquisition are important to elucidate , to enable appropriate public health interventions to mitigate against high risk and reduce adverse outcomes from the infection . We conducted a systematic review and meta analysis to summarise and critically analyse the existing evidence on SARS - CoV - 2 risk factors among HCWs . With no geographical limitation , we included studies , in any country , that reported ( i ) PCR laboratory diagnosis of COVID—19 as an independent variable ( ii ) one or more COVID - 19 risk factors among health care workers with risk estimates ( relative risk , odds ratio or harzard ratio ) ( iii ) original , quantitative study design and published in English or Mandarian . Our initial search resulted in 470 articles overall , however , only 10 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review . Out of the 10 studies included in the review , inadequate / lack of protective personal equipment ( PPE ) , performing tracheal intubation ( PTI ) and gender were the most common risk factors of COVID - 19 . Based on the random effects adjusted pooled relative risk , HCWs who reported use PPE were 29 % ( 95 % CI : 16 % to 41 % ) less likely to test positive for COVID - 19 . The study also revealed that HCWs who performed tracheal intubations were 34 % ( 95 % CI : 14 % to 57 % ) more likely to test positive for COVID - 19 . Interestingly , this study showed that female HCWs are at 11 % higher risk ( RR 1 . 11 95 % CI 1 . 01 - 1 . 21 ) of COVID - 19 than their male counterparts . This paper presents initial findings from a living systematic review and meta - analysis , therefore , did not yield many studies , however , it revealed a significant insight to better understand COVID - 19 risk factors among HCWs ; insights important for devising preventive strategies that protect them from this infection .

Since its emergence in December 2019 , there have over 253 million confirmed cases worldwide as of 15 th November 2021 [ 2 ] . The rapidly evolving situation required a quick action from policy makers . Such as mandatory mask - wearing , social distancing , lockdowns , school and business shutdown , and cross - border restrictions , among others [ 3 ] . Public health systems in many countries were not adequately prepared to deal with the sudden surges in demand for personal protective equipment ( PPE ) and other consumables whose need became very high due to increases in COVID - 19 case burden and the need to provide HCWs with additional layers of protection . Shortages of face masks and other pieces of PPE were reported across many countries due to an unexpected imposition of mandatory mask - wearing requirements in the general population to contain the spread of infection . The inadequate availability of PPE may have contributed significantly to the additional risk of COVID - 19 infection among HCWs [ 4 ] . What is more , the severity and rapid transmission of COVID - 19 overloaded the HCWs weakening the established infection prevention and control ( IPC ) across many health settings [ 5 ] . Despite the high observed rate of the knowledge , attitude , and practices of HCWs towards COVID - 19 containment compared to other communities , the overloaded working environment with the shortage of PPE made HCWs more vulnerable to COVID - 19 infection [ 6 - 10 ] . Health care workers ( HCWs ) are more than ten times more likely to contract COVID - 19 compared to the general population , thus demonstrating the burden of COVID - 19 among HCWs [ 11 ] . Factors that expose HCWs to a differentially high - risk of COVID - 19 acquisition are important to elucidate , to enable appropriate public health interventions to mitigate against high risk and reduce adverse outcomes from the infection . In a previous systematic review Gomez - Ochoa et al revealed the lack of PPE , patient contact , and suboptimal hand hygiene as risk factors for COVID - 19 among HCWs [ 12 ] . However no meta - analysis was conducted . Furthermore , Chou et al , living rapid review focused on a broad range of coronavirus infections . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 Of the 64 studies that met inclusion criteria ; 43 studies addressed burden of HCW infections ( 15 on SARS - CoV - 2 ) , and 34 studies addressed risk factors ( 3 on SARS - CoV - 2 ) [ 13 ] . Only 3 studies included reported risk factors for SARS - CoV - 2 infections among health workers . Notably , from the onset of the COVID - 19 pandemic , the frontline HCWs have played a significant role in saving lives of many regardless of their occupational exposure to COVID - 19 [ 14 ] . Following a rapid review to understand the risk factors related to COVID - 19 among HCWs , we demonstrated the need to establish sustainable measures to protect HCWs [ 5 ] . To better inform occupational health policy and map available evidence on the COVID - 19 risk factors among HCWs , we conducted a systematic review and meta - analysis to summarise and critically analyse the existing evidence on SARS - CoV - 2 risk factors among HCWs . Given the dynamic nature of the COVID - 19 pandemic , there is an urgent need to continuously review the literature and update the aggregated evidence base to accurately and timely guide effective clinical and public health interventions . We present here the first report of a living systematic review and meta - analysis , to inform evidence - based guideline recommendations for effective preventive measures to reduce occupational transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 infection among HCWs . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 MATERIALS AND METHODS a . Study Design The protocol was developed and published [ 15 ] and registered in PROSPERO ( CRD42020193508 ) . This review was reported in accordance with the reporting guideline provided in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analysis Protocols ( PRISMA - P ) statement [ 16 ] . The systematic review and meta - analysis was conducted in line with the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination ( CRD ) guidance for undertaking systematic reviews in healthcare [ 17 ] , and the Meta - analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ( MOOSE ) guidelines for design and implementation [ 18 ] . b . Study Selection i . Search strategy The search strategy used both medical subject heading ( MeSH ) and text word searches . Initial search terms in the published protocol [ 15 ] were adopted and used without changes . Two reviewers ( MM and IC ) searched EBSCOhost platform , specifically , Academic search complete , health source : nursing / academic edition , CINAHL with full text , Embase , PubMed , MEDLINE , ScienceDirect databases , Google Scholar and World Health Organization library databases for relevant studies . Two other reviewers ( PG , JA ) searched the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database . Inclusion and exclusion criteria Criteria were developed in an iterative process after preliminary searches during study protocol development [ 15 ] . Briefly , studies were eligible if they were ( i ) reporting PCR laboratory diagnosis of COVID—19 as an independent variable ( ii ) reporting one or more COVID - 19 risk factors among health care workers with risk estimates ( relative risk , odds ratio or harzard ratio ) ( iii ) original , quantitative study design published in English or Mandarian . ii . Selecting studies J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 The titles and abstracts of all identified articles were assessed by two independent reviewers ( IC and MM ) . If a study was deemed to potentially fulfil the inclusion criteria , full - text versions were retrieved and assessed . Reference lists of all retrieved articles were searched . To assess how reliably the study eligibility criteria were applied , a third reviewer ( PGI ) applied the inclusion criteria to all studies , given the small number of studies included , and agreement between the primary allocation and the third reviewer allocation had a Cohen ' s kappa score of 1 ( denotes full agreement ) . c . Data extraction The data extraction table presented in the published protocol was piloted by MM and IC . The table was revised to exclude data on number of cases and controls for the initial extraction . This data was only collected from studies included in the meta - analysis for COVID - 19 risk factors stage . The final data extraction tool is available on Supplementary File 1 . d . Assessment of study quality and risk of bias The NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross - Sectional Studies [ 19 , 20 ] was used to rate study quality . Two reviewers assessed methodological quality ( MM and IC ) . Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer ( TD ) . Meta - biases were assessed using funnel plots to detect potential reporting biases and small - study effects [ 21 ] and complemented with the Egger regression test [ 22 ] . e . Data synthesis Firstly , a narrative analysis of reported risk factors across studies was synthesised descriptively to understand the key risk factors for SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Secondly , similar type of risk factors for SARS - CoV - 2 infections reported in at least 2 studies were pooled from each study for overall estimates . f . Statistical Analysis J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 The outcome of interest were the incidence rates of , and factors associated with COVID - 19 across all studies estimated using the random - effects model . The Q and I2 were calculated in all the meta - analysis to assess heterogeneity . The I² statistic describes the percentage of variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance . In this review , however , no meaningful conclusions could be drawn from these calculations because the number of studies included for meta - analysis was very small ( i . e . less than 10 ) . Egger’s test and the funnel plot were not used for the evaluation of publication bias because the number of studies included for meta - analysis was very small ( i . e . less than 10 ) . All analyses were performed using Meta and Metasens statistical packages available in R version 4 . 2 . 1 software package . The summary measures calcutated include a narrative report of all reported risk factors in the included studies , a pooled incidence of COVID - 19 among health workers from included cohort studies and a pooled relative risk for risk factors reported by at least 2 included studies . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 RESULTS Our initial search resulted in 470 articles overall ( Supplementary File 2 ) . After removing 8 duplicates , 462 articles proceeded to the title screening phase . Among these , 342 articles were excluded , and 120 articles proceeded to abstract review . Among these , 104 were excluded ( Supplementary File 2 ) . 16 full text articles were screened for eligibility [ 23 - 38 ] , 6 were excluded [ 24 , 28 , 31 - 33 , 36 ] and ultimately 10 eligible studies were included in this review and meta - analysis . Reasons for exclusion at full text review stage included lack of PCR confirmation of COVID - 19 infection [ 24 , 31 - 33 , 36 ] , and lack of evidence on risk estimates for COVID - 19 risk factors [ 28 ] . Studies included were conducted in China [ 34 , 35 , 37 ] , USA [ 26 , 29 ] , India [ 23 , 27 ] , Italy [ 25 ] , Spain [ 30 ] and Colombia [ 38 ] . Of the studies included , 3 were retrospective cohorts [ 34 , 35 , 37 ] , 2 were prospective cohorts [ 26 , 29 ] , 3 were case controls [ 23 , 27 , 38 ] and one was a cross sectional [ 30 ] and one case series [ 25 ] . More details on the included studies characteristics are available on Supplementary File 1 . Gender was reported as a risk factor for COVID - 19 among HCWs [ 23 , 29 , 38 ] . In a study conducted in Colombia , male gender ( AOR = 4 . 13 95 % CI 1 . 70 – 10 . 05 ) was associated with laboratory diagnosis of COVID - 19 among HCWs [ 38 ] . In India , male HCWs had higher odds of COVID - 19 infection than their female counterparts [ 23 ] . Lack / inadequate use of PPE was also reported in three studies ; one conducted in Colombia [ 38 ] , and in two studies from India [ 23 , 27 ] . HCWs performing tracheal intubation had higher odds of COVID - 19 infection in two studies [ 23 , 37 ] . More details on reported risk factors are presented in Supplementary File 1 . Based on the available 5 cohort studies , the random effects adjusted pooled incidence of COVID - 19 cases observed among HCWs was 12 % [ 95 % CI : 4 to 29 % ] . The forest plot for the meta - analysis of the cohort studies is presented in Figure 1 for further details . Figure 1 : Forest plot showing the meta - analysis for the incidence of COVID - 19 among the cohort studies J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 Out of the overall 10 studies included in the review , inadequate / lack of protective personal equipment ( PPE ) , performing tracheal intubation ( PTI ) and gender were the most common risk factors of COVID - 19 . Out of the 10 studies , only 3 studies reported the use of PPE as a risk factor of COVID - 19 . Based on the random effects adjusted pooled relative risk , it is estimated that those who use PPE were 29 % ( 95 % CI : 16 % to 41 % ) less likely to test positive for COVID - 19 . The forest plot for the meta - analysis of the effect of the use of PPE is presented in figure 2 for further details . Figure 2 : Forest plot showing the meta - analysis for the effect of the use of PPE Out of the 10 studies , only 2 studies reported PTI as a risk factor of COVID - 19 . Based on the random effects adjusted pooled relative risk , it is estimated that those who PTI were 34 % ( 95 % CI : 14 % to 57 % ) more likely to test positive for COVID - 19 . The forest plot for the meta - analysis of the effect of PTI is presented in figure 3 for further details . Figure 3 : Forest plot showing the meta - analysis for the effect of performing tracheal intubation Out of the 3 studies that reported gender as a risk factor , only 2 studies provided sufficient data and were included in the meta - analysis . . Based on the random effects adjusted pooled relative risk , it is estimated that the female participants in these studies were 11 % ( 95 % CI : 1 % to 21 % ) more likely to test positive for COVID - 19 . The forest plot for the meta - analysis of the effect of gender is presented in figure 4 for further details . Figure 4 : Forest plot showing the meta - analysis for the effect of gender Quality Assessment of included studies Eight studies [ 21 , 23 , 27 , 28 , 32 - 35 ] had fair quality while 2 studies [ 25 , 36 ] good quality .

J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 DISCUSSION Understanding COVID - 19 risk factors among HCWs is critical to formulate the correct preventive strategies and policies , and make sure this critical population is protected from COVID - 19 and its devastating health effects . This is moreso as it becomes clearer that SARS - CoV - 2 is likely to persist as a major respiratory pathogen in the future globally . The emergence of new variants of concern such as the beta variant and delta variant , and more recently , omicron , means effective preventive strategies over and above vaccination remain critical . In this systematic review with meta - analysis , we unveiled some of the risk factors for COVID - 19 in this population , over and above other risk factors as pertains to the general population . The study noted that the pooled incidence of COVID - 19 from cohort studies was 12 % ( 95 % CI 5 - 26 % ) , which is high , but highly unlikely representative of the global population of HCWs , as this meta - analysis only included 5 cohort studies which excluded some geographical regions such as Africa . These excluded settings may lack adequate personal protective equipment and other requisites for infection prevention and control such as good , controlled ventilation , and hence may have higher incidences of the infection among HCWs . Moreover , very high heterogeneity was noted among the included studies . However , this incidence is comparable to the 10 % that has been reported elsewhere [ 39 ] . Accurate figures of incidence of infection among HCWs will be likely elusive because of different testing strategies in different countries , with some testing only symptomatic workers whilst some mandatorily test all their HCWs , and also similar to the general population , HCWs do not have uniform health seeking behaviours . PPE remains a major component of infection prevention control ; however , studies on this may be difficult as there are marked variations globally in what might be termed appropriate and adequate PPE for certain tasks . Depending on the level of exposure and aerosol generation , different tasks certainly require different levels of PPE , with anesthesiologists performing invasive airway procedures needing stronger protection than for example , a HCW in an outpatients clinic seeing relatively stable patients . Thus , only 3 studies [ 23 , 27 , 38 ] were retrieved assessing the use of PPE and noted a 29 % ( RR 0 . 71 , 95 % CI 0 . 59 - 0 . 84 ) reduced risk J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 in a random effects model . This did not vary in a fixed - effects model signifying less heterogeneity . PPE was also reported as a risk factor for COVID - 19 infection among HCWs in an earlier review [ 12 ] . Chou et al . also revealed the same results in their systematic review that included three studies reporting the SARS - CoV - 2 risk factors among HCWs [ 13 ] . While the results of the present review and previous ones are consistent , more studies would be needed , with more uniformity and design to ascertain the effectiveness of PPE in reducing the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection among HCWs . Meanwhile , resource limited countries must make use of WHO recommendations on rationalizing the use of this scarce commodity during pandemic times [ 40 ] . The availability , accessibility and quality of PPE is an important modifiable risk factor for COVID - 19 among HCWs . It is imperative therefore that administrators and policymakers must find effective ways of improving stocks and quality of this essential commodity , even including stocks in anticipation of further future waves . Local in - country production of PPE in resource - limited countries is cost - effective , and reduces the costs associated with importing from other countries . Ways of boosting local production include collaborating with local educational institutions such as Universities and Polytechnic colleges to test effectiveness of types of PPE and then produce en - masse . For example , in Zimbabwe , the government partnered with the University of Zimbabwe to boost the production of face - masks ( and hand - sanitisers ) , which significantly improved the availability of these commodities . Additionally , encouraging foreign production companies to invest in resource - limited countries will boost the ability and capacity to produce PPE , especially in sub - Saharan Africa , whilst saving on the scarce foreign currency reserves , and improving local skills . This could be in the form of collaborations between local manufacturing companies or institutions of higher learning and foreign - based production companies . Performing endotracheal intubation , not surprisingly , was noted as a significant risk factor for COVID - 19 among HCWs , RR 1 . 34 95 % CI 1 . 14 - 1 . 57 . Endotracheal intubation is a highly aerosol - generating procedure , and in the absence of adequate PPE , significantly exposes the performing HCW to a significant J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 concentration of SARS - CoV - 2 particles hence COVID - 19 infection ; however , the level of PPE available for the HCW is a significant confounder for this analysis . Unfortunately , only 2 studies [ 23 , 37 ] were retrieved for this first report , limiting the analysis performed . Nevertheless , this result largely conforms to what is known / suspected and reinforces the need to provide any HCWs involved in performing this procedure with adequate prevention strategies [ 29 , 41 ] . This study showed that female HCWs are at 11 % higher risk ( RR 1 . 11 95 % CI 1 . 01 - 1 . 21 ) of COVID - 19 than their male counterparts . Unfortunately , only 2 studies were retrieved for the first report of the living systematic review , thus limiting the analysis that can be performed , and seem to deviate from the wider literature where males are at a significantly higher risk of COVID - 19 and its associated adverse effects [ 42 ] . More well designed studies would be needed to answer this question but one key observation is that in general , the proportion of female HCWs is much higher than that of males [ 43 ] . A major strength of this review was the use of a comprehensive search strategy and searching multiple electronic databases . The included studies were all of acceptable quality grading , with seven being graded as fair and 3 as good . seven cohort studies were assessed on 14 domains while the case control studies were assessed on 13 domains . The quality of evidence grades reflects the extent of confidence that our estimate of effect is correct , and this was generally acceptable for our review . However , a number of limitations are worth noting that include the limited number of studies in this area , and the lack of generalizability of findings . There is a paucity of studies looking at HCWs COVID - 19 infections , and therefore some other risk factors may have been missed . Additionally , there is likely to be a higher level of interactions and confounding between the risk factors , including with the other risk factors that affect the general population such as obesity , smoking and the presence of comorbities such as hypertension and diabetes [ 44 , 45 ] . Unfortunately , with the dearth of studies , no advanced analyses such as meta regression could be performed in this study . Now that most countries initiated vaccination programmes and prioritized frontline HCWs , it is important to understand how this is going to modify the risk factors among this population , hence ongoing studies are needed . Finally , no analysis was conducted to better understand the risk factors by profession . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 Analyses that distinguish between patient facing and non - patient facing HCWs may be informative as these two groups inherently have different incidence and risk factors . CONCLUSION Understanding COVID - 19 risk factors among HCWs is important for devising preventive strategies that protect them from this infection , protecting the most vulnerable . This paper presents initial findings from a living systematic review and meta - analysis , therefore , did not yield many studies , however , it revealed a significant incidence of 12 % of COVID - 19 among HCWs , alongside lack of PPE , female gender and performing endotracheal intubation as significant risk factors . More studies , especially among the low - resource settings of sub - Saharan Africa , which are not represented in this study , are needed to sufficiently inform policy and strategy and devise appropriate evidence - based preventive strategies to protect HCWs .
