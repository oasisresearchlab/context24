The molecular details of oligomerization and the mechanism of the mechanochemical coupling are currently unknown . Here we present the crystal structure of human dynamin 1 in the nucleotide - free state with a four - domain architecture comprising the GTPase domain , the bundle signalling element , the stalk and the pleckstrin homology domain . Dynamin 1 oligomerized in the crystals via the stalks , which assemble in a criss - cross fashion . The stalks further interact via conserved surfaces with the pleckstrin homology domain and the bundle signalling element of the neighbouring dynamin molecule . This intricate domain interaction rationalizes a number of disease - related mutations in dynamin 2 and suggests a structural model for the mechanochemical coupling that reconciles previous models of dynamin function . Dynamin , the founding member of the dynamin superfamily , is a 100 - kDa mechanochemical enzyme ( Fig . 1a ) involved in the scission of clathrin - coated vesicles from the plasma membrane 1 . The brain - specific isoform dynamin 1 mediates uptake of synaptic vesicles in presynaptic terminals 2 – 4 , whereas a function of dynamin 3 at the post - synaptic density has been described 5 . Dynamin 2 is ubiquitously expressed 6 , and mutations in its middle domain ( MD ) , pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domainandGTPaseeffectordomain ( GED ) arelinked to human diseases , for example , rare forms of centronuclear myopathy and Charcot – Marie – Tooth peripheral neuropathy 7 . Upon recruitment via the carboxy - terminal proline - rich domain ( PRD ) , dynamin oligo - merizes into helical structures around the neck of budding vesicles and catalyses vesicle scission in a GTP - hydrolysis - dependent manner 8 , 9 . Different mechanisms for the scission reaction have been proposed , including GTP - hydrolysis - dependent constriction 10 , extension 11 and twisting 9 ofthe vesicle neck .

All rights reserved ©2011 dynamin oligomer induces hemifusion of the inner membrane leaflet followed by complete membrane scission after GTP - hydrolysis - dependent release 12 , 13 . To resolve the detailed molecular mechanism , high - resolution structural data for full - length dynamin are required which , to date , are available only for the isolated PH domain 14 , 15 and the GTPase ( G ) domain 16 , 17 . Low - resolution electron microscopy reconstructions of dynamin oligomers showed that nucleotide binding leads to constriction of helical assemblies through rearrangements in the stalk region composed of the MD and GED 18 . Furthermore , G domain dimerization via a conserved interface across the nucleo - tide - bindingsitewasshowntomediatethestimulatedGTPaseactivity 19 . We recently described the structure of the stalk of the dynamin - like antiviral myxovirus resistance protein 1 ( MxA ) GTPase and elucidated itsmodeofoligomerization , whichinvolvesthreedistinctinterfacesand two loop regions in the stalk 20 . Using this information , we succeeded to determine the structure of dynamin 1 . The structure of human dynamin 1 We reasoned that the propensity of dynamin to oligomerize at high protein concentrations might interfere with the formation of protein crystals . On the basis of our previous MxA study 20 , we assayed a num - ber of mutants in a human dynamin 1 construct ( amino acids 6 – 746 , Fig . 1a ) foroligomerizationdefects . Indeed , afive - amino - acidexchange ( IHGIR395 – 399AAAAA ) in a conserved motif mapping to loop L2 of theMxA stalk 20 interferedwithhigher - orderassemblyand resulted ina monodisperse dimeric dynamin 1 species ( Supplementary Fig . 1 , see also ref . 21 ) . Crystals of a construct containing additionally the K562E mutation were obtained in the absence of nucleotides and diffracted to a maximal resolution of 3 . 7A˚ ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . The structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to R work / R free of 28 . 4 % / 33 . 5 % ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . To verify the sequence , the positions of 19 internal methionines were assigned by a single anomalous dispersion approach ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Dynamin 1 ( D PRD ) has a four - domain architecture , composed of the G domain , the bundle signalling element ( BSE ) , the stalk and the PH domain ( annotatedassuperscriptG , B , SandP , respectively ) , whichdoes not strictly follow the sequence - derived domain boundaries ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . The structure ofthe amino - terminalG domain is very similar to that of the isolated nucleotide - free G domain 17 ( root - mean - square deviation ( r . m . s . d . ) of 1 . 4A˚ for 287 C a atoms ) and shows a curved central b - sheet surrounded by a - helices at both sides . The two switch regions known to mediate nucleotide - dependent conformational changes and the cis stabilizing loop , involved in G domain dimeriza - tion 19 , are partly disordered . At the N and C termini of the G domain , helices a 1 B and a 2 B , together with a 3 B from the C - terminal part of the GED of the same molecule , forma three - helix bundle , the BSE 19 , 22 ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Compared to the previously described G domain - BSE construct in the GDP N AlF 4 2 - bound form 19 , a 1 B is shifted bytwoturnsrelativeto a 2 B / a 3 B ( SupplementaryFigs2and4 ) , whereasit interacts with the G domain in a similar fashion in both structures . At the C - terminal end of a 2 B , the BSE connects to the stalk of dynamin 1 . The stalk is composed of a four - helix bundle where three helices , a 1 S – a 3 S , are provided by the MD and a 4 S by the N - terminal partoftheGED ( Fig . 1andSupplementaryFig . 5a ) . a 1 S indynamin1is subdivided into a 1N S , a 1M S and a 1C S by two disordered loops , L1N S and L1C S , compared to a single break of the corresponding helix in MxA . Furthermore , a 3 S in dynamin 1 is extended by a highly con - servedloopL4 S . AttheCterminusofthestalk , a 4 S closelypacksagainst a 1 S – a 3 S via hydrophobic contacts and leads the polypeptide chain back to the BSE . Despite an overall sequence identity of only 16 % , the architecture of the dynamin 1 and MxA stalk is remarkably similar ( r . m . s . d . of 2 . 6A˚ for 160 aligned C a atoms , Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . The PH domain is interconnected between a 3 S and a 4 S of the stalk by two disordered loops , L1 SP and L2 SP , and shows only minor devia - tions from the isolated PH domain of dynamin 1 ( refs 14 , 15 ; r . m . s . d . of 0 . 8 A˚ for 102 C a atoms ) . The three lipid binding loops 23 – 25 are only partially resolved and point towards the solvent ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Dynamin assembly via the stalk Similarly to the MxA stalks 20 , the dynamin 1 stalks in the crystals were arranged in a criss - cross fashion resulting in a linear stalk filament . The highly conserved symmetric interface - 2 of 1 , 200 A˚ 2 is located in the centre of the stalk ( according to the MxA nomenclature , Fig . 2 and 90° α 3 S α 4 S K683 L680 T676 E482 I481 E482 K683 L680 T676 I481 α 3 S α 4 S Stalk PH domain BSE G domain Hinge 1 Predicted interface - 1 Interface - 2 Predicted interface - 3 Linear R465W Δ V625 L570H Δ 555 - 558 K554 E560K Δ K562 , K562E G358R E368K / Q R369W / Q A618T S619L / W α 1 P D614 A618 L621 P627 R629 F372 K376 V375 D380 α 1M S E611 R369 30° • 1 2 1 2 filament Figure 2 | The dynamin 1 dimer .

Assembly via this interface results in an extended dynamin dimer that serves as building block for dynamin oligomers 26 . Shape and dimension of this dimer agree well with a small - angle X - ray scattering study 27 . We previously showed that a second hydrophobic interface in the MxAstalk , interface - 1 , mediatesassemblyofhigher - order oligomers 20 . In dynamin 1 , however , the stalks do not contact each other directly at the predicted interface - 1 ( minimal distance 4 . 5 A˚ , Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . This difference is caused by a 5 u tilt of the dynamin 1 stalks relative to the stalk axis . The hydrophobic nature of this surface in dynamin1anditsconservationinthedynaminfamily ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) is indicative of a similar function as in MxA as an oligomeriza - tion site . Closure of interface - 1 might induce a pitch in the dynamin assemblies leading to helical oligomers rather than to ring - like struc - tures as in MxA 28 . L2 S containing the disruptive IHGIR395 – 399AAAAA mutation and L1N S are not ordered in the linear dynamin 1 oligomer ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . The corresponding loops in the MxA stalk form a third interface ( interface - 3 ) which also contributes to the assembly of oligomers ( Fig . 2 ) . Accordingly , mutations in both loops in dynamin 1 ( ref . 21 ) , MxA 20 and in L1 of dynamin 1 - like protein 29 , 30 prevent oligomerization . Interestingly , Ser 347 and Tyr 354 in loop L1N S in dynamin 1 are phosphorylated in vivo 31 , 32 and might control the assembly status . Interactions of the BSE TheBSEinteractswiththecentral b - sheet oftheGdomain viaa mostly hydrophilic interface of 1 , 100A˚ 2 ( Supplementary Figs 4 and 6 ) . In contrast , the BSE and concomitantly the G domain are only loosely associated with the stalk of the same molecule via loops L1 BS and L2 BS constituting a flexible hinge ( hinge 1 ) , as observed in other dynamin related proteins 33 ( Figs 1b and 2 , and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Interestingly , Asp 744 at the C terminus of a 3 B of the BSE contacts Arg 440 in a 2 S of the neighbouring , parallel dynamin 1 stalk ( Fig . 3a ) . A similar intermolecular interaction mediates oligomerization and the antiviral function of MxA ( S . G . , K . F . , O . D . , unpublished obser - vation ) . We tested the importance of this contact experimentally . The wild - type dynamin 1 construct bound efficiently to liposomes result - ing in an approximately 200 - fold stimulation of GTPase activity ( Sup - plementary Fig . 7 ) . The single R440A and D744A mutants behaved as wild type in these assays . To analyse the role of these residues for cla - thrin - mediated endocytosis , dynamin 2 – eGFP mutants ( a fusion of dynamin 2 with enhanced green fluorescent protein ) were re - expressed in HeLa cells depleted of endogenous dynamin 2 . Both R440A and D744Amutantslocalizedsimilarlyaswild - typedynamin2totheplasma membrane ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) , but transferrin internalization was increased ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Thus , the salt bridge has an inhibitory and / or control function in dynamin - based endocytosis . The stalk – PH domain interface a 1M S ofthestalkformsaconservedsurfaceof370A˚ 2 withthePHdomain ( Figs1band2 , andSupplementaryFigs3and5c ) . Interestingly , 19unique mutations causing centronuclear myopathy or Charcot – Marie – Tooth disease 7 cluster in the stalk or the PH domain of dynamin 2 , but none localizes to the G domain or BSE ( Fig . 2 ) . For example , mutations E368K / Q and R369W / Q in the stalk and A618T and S619L / W in the PH domain are directly in or in close vicinity to the interface between the two domains . Mutations A618T and S619L / W lead to increased oligomerization rates of dynamin in solution 27 , 34 , suggesting that the stalk – PH interface controls oligomerization . In gel filtration , the disease - related stalk mutant E368K also eluted as high molecular weight species . Consistently , this mutant showed a 20 - fold increased basal GTPase rate , whereas the liposome - stimulated GTPase reaction and transferrin uptake were unchanged ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . In contrast , the R369W mutant behaved as wild - type dynamin in biochemical and endocytosis assays . Mutations at the periphery of this interface ( S619L , L621D ) also did not compromise dynamin 2 - based endocytic activity ( Fig . 3b ) , indicating that more subtle changes lead to the disease - phenotype . Interestingly , the F372D mutant in the centre of the interface showed significantly higher trans - ferrin uptake compared to wild - type dynamin 2 , pointing also to an inhibitory and / or control function of this interface for dynamin - based endocytosis . Conformational changes during dynamin assembly Based on the isolated BSE and PH domain ( Fig . 1b ) , the stalk dimer ( Fig . 2 ) , the GDP N AlF 4 2 - bound G domain dimer 19 , and electron microscopy reconstructions of oligomerized dynamin 1 in the con - stricted state 18 , we generated a molecular model for self - assembly of dynamin into helical structures ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . The resulting dynamin dimer spans a length of more than 260 A ˚ and covers 95 u of a dynamin ring , thereby placing G domain and BSE above the neighbouring stalk . According to this model , oligomeriza - tion of dynamin proceeds along the central stalk , whereas the G domains mediate contacts between neighbouring turns ( see ref . 20 for a similar MxA model ) . When comparing the linear structure of dynamin 1 in the crystal with the helical assembly , large - scale domain movements are apparent ( SupplementaryFig . 11 ) .

Additionally , the G domain separates from the BSE by a rotation around the invariant Pro32 and Pro294 ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . The corresponding residues Gly68 and Gly309 in BDLP 33 , 35 and Pro342 in atlastin 36 , 37 have also been suggested to act as a hinge ( hinge 2 ) . Integrity of the G domain – BSEinterface is crucial forthe function of dynamin , as indicated by the aggregationoftheI10Dinterfacemutant invivo ( SupplementaryFigs6 and 8 ) . Furthermore , I10D behaved as a dominant - negative mutant in transferrin uptake assays ( Fig . 3b ) . Moreover , the QD17 – 18AA muta - tion rendered dynamin 2 largely inactive in endocytosis assays , despite localizing correctly to clathrin - coated pits at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . The PH domains also undergo a pronounced rearrangement , to a position below the stalk , with the lipid - binding loops 23 – 25 oriented towards the membrane ( Supplementary Fig . 11a ) . We suggest that the stalk PH domain interface is disrupted by binding of the PH domain to high - affinity , phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate - containing mem - branes such as the plasma membrane 23 – 25 , thereby promoting dynamin oligomerization . Finally , we suggest that rotation of stalk dimers via the flexible interface - 1 and / or interface - 3 , leaving interface - 2 unchanged , leads to bending of the linear oligomer and allows helix formation ( Sup - plementary Figs 11b and 12 ) . Interestingly , the IHGIR395 – 399AAAAA mutation in interface - 3 prevented liposome binding and , consequently , the liposome - stimulated GTPase activity ( Sup - plementary Fig . 7 ) . This mutant further behaved in a dominant - negative fashion in transferrin uptake assays ( Fig . 3b ) and displayed a diffuse localization and reduced recruitment to clathrin - coated pits ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . These results point to the central role of interface - 3 for the function of dynamin . Discussion The present work , combined with prior studies 18 – 20 , 38 , suggests a struc - tural model for the mechanochemical coupling in dynamin that is consistent with previous models 9 – 11 . Our structural analysis indicates that the diameter of helical dynamin assemblies is controlled by the angle between two stalk dimers ( Supplementary Figs 11b and 12f – h ) . We suggest that this angle is adjusted in response to GTP - dependent dimerization of the G domains : a relaxed conformation of interface - 1 is adopted in the absence of G domain constraints , whereas GTP - triggered dimerization of the G domains constrains rotation in inter - face - 1 and induces a bent , constricted conformation ( Supplementary Fig . 11b ) , possibly via the BSE – stalk interface ( Fig . 3a ) . Interestingly , in molecular dynamics simulations of two stalk dimers , the bent conformation of interface - 1 rapidly converts towards a relaxed state , concomitant with an opening of the helical oligomer ( Fig . 4b and Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . This supports our assumption that con - straints from G domains dimerization are required for the stabiliza - tion of the constricted state . Accordingly , dynamin initially assembles via the stalks with interface - 1 in a relaxed conformation , allowing the filament to adopt a range of different diameters 12 ( state I in Fig . 4b and Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . When the filament has embraced its template , GTP - loaded G domains of adjacent turns dimerize , the inhibitory stalk – BSE inter - face ( Fig . 3a ) is disrupted and the bent conformation of interface - 1 is induced . This will result in constriction of the filament if the lipid template is flexible ( state IV in Fig . 4b , constrictase model 10 ) or com - paction of the dynamin helix if the lipid template is rigid ( state II in Fig . 4b , poppase model 11 ) . Constriction of a long dynamin helix will induce a sliding of neighbouring filaments until a new constricted equilibrium position of the oligomer is reached . This sliding is observed as a rotary movement of the dynamin helix upon addition of GTP in real - time imaging assays ( twistase model 9 ) . To reach the constricted state along the whole assembly , several cycles of local release and rebinding of neighbouring dynamin turns might be trig - gered by GTP - dependent dimerization of G domains and dissociation after GTP hydrolysis ( state III in Fig . 4b ) . Accordingly , GTP binding and hydrolysis areboth required for the mechanochemical function of dynamin 8 , 39 and might induce local opening or twisting of the con - stricted dynamin helix . The resulting shear forces could tear the underlying membrane . a GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG G BSE PH G G G G G G G BSE BSE BSE BSE BSE Stalk BSE G G BSE BSE Stalk PH 90° G BSE Stalk Stalk Stalk PH PH BSE G PH G G Stalk BSE G 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 10 nm P o pp a s e T w i s t a s e Constriction GTPbinding b Diameter of dynamin helix G T P b i n d i n g G T P b i n d i n g ( IV ) Constricted state GTP hydrolysis G T P h y d r o l ys i s R i s e o f d y n a m i n h e li x ( I ) Relaxed state ( II ) Non - constricted state ( III ) Intermediate state 95° Figure 4 | Modelfordynaminoligomerizationandfunction . a , Modelofthe oligomerized dynamin helix in the constricted state , in top and side view ( see also Supplementary Fig . 10 ) .

Human dynamin 1 ( residues 6 – 746 ) and indicated mutants of this construct were expressed from pET46 - EK / LIC ( Novagen ) as N - terminal His 6 - tag fusion followed by a PreScission cleavage site . The crystallized construct contained mutations IHGIR395 – 399AAAAA which prevented oligomerization and K562E which reduced DNA contaminations dur - ing purification . Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli host strain Rosetta2 - BL21 - DE3 , and bacteria were cultured in autoinduction medium ( Novagen ) for 7 . 5h at 37 u C followed by temperature shift to 20 u C for overnight expression . Selenomethionine ( SeMet ) - substituted human dynamin 1 was expressed in M9 minimal medium , supplemented with L - amino acids Lys , Phe , Thr ( 100mgl 2 1 ) , Ile , Leu , Val , SeMet ( 50mgl 2 1 ) , usingthesamevectorandhoststrainasfornative protein expression 40 . Cells were resuspended in buffer A ( 25mM HEPES / NaOH ( pH7 . 9 ) , 500mM NaCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , 1 m M DNase ( Roche ) , 500 m M Pefabloc ( Roth ) ) and disrupted by a microfluidizer ( Microfluidics ) . Cleared lysates ( 95 , 000 g , 1h , 4 u C ) were incubated with Benzonase ( Novagen ) for 30min at 4 u C before application to a Co 2 1 - Talon column ( Clontech ) . Protein was eluted with buffer A containing additional 100mM imidazole . Fractions containing human dynamin 1 were incubated with 2 . 4mM b - mercaptoethanol and His 6 - tagged Prescission protease overnight at 4 u C . Using 50 kDa molecular weight cut - off concentrators ( Amicon ) , imidazole , b - mercaptoethanol and the free His - tag were removed by washing with buffer A , before a second application to a Co 2 1 - Talon column to remove non - cleaved His - tagged dynamin 1 and protease . The flow - through and four column volumes of washing buffer A were collected and concentrated . Finally , dynamin 1 was purified by size exclusion chromato - graphy on a Superdex200 column ( GE ) in buffer containing 25mM HEPES / NaOH ( pH7 . 5 ) , 300mM NaCl , 2mM MgCl 2 . Fractions containing dynamin 1 were pooled , concentrated and flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . SeMet - substituted protein was purified using the same protocol . Crystallization and structure determination . Crystallization trials by the sitting - drop vapour - diffusion method were performed at 4 u C using a Hydra - plus - One pipetting robot ( Matrix Technologies Corporation ) and Rock Imager storage system ( Formulatrix ) . The human dynamin 1 construct ( 300nl at a concentration of 12mgml 2 1 ) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 9 % PEG400 , 6 % isopropanol , 100mM HEPES / NaOH ( pH7 . 3 ) , 10mM MgCl 2 and 10mM KCl . Crystals of the native protein appeared after 2weeks and had dimensions of 0 . 2mm 3 0 . 05mm 3 0 . 02mm . Crystals of SeMetproteinwereobtainedin6 % MPD , 10 % isopropanol , 0 . 1MHEPES / NaOH ( pH7 . 5 ) . During flash - cooling of the crystals in liquid nitrogen , a cryo - solution containing additionally 20 % ethylene glycol was used . All data were recorded at BL14 . 1 at BESSY II , Berlin . One native data set was collected from a single crystal and processed and scaled using the XDS program suite 41 . Phase information was obtained by molecular replacement with Phaser 42 using the structure of the nucleotide - free rat dynamin 1 G domain 16 , the stalk of human MxA 20 and the human PH domain 15 as search models . The model was built using COOT 43 and iteratively refined using CNS1 . 3 with a deformable elastic network 44 , followed by 10cyclesofTLSrefinementusing1TLSgroupperdomaininrefmac5 ( ref . 45 ) . To confirmtheaminoacidsequence , adatasetofaSeMet - substitutedproteincrystal wasrecordedattheseleniumpeakwavelength . Owingtonon - isomorphismofthe native and SeMet crystals , molecular replacement with the refined native struc - turewasperformed . Thepositionsof19outof26seleniumatomsinthedynamin 1constructweredeterminedbycalculatingananomalousdifferencemapwiththeCCP4programsuite 46 using the calculated phases after refinement . The final native model comprises amino acids 6 – 746 . Residues 63 – 64 , 110 – 112 , 143 – 149 , 347 – 356 , 394 – 404 , 446 – 447 , 500 – 517 , 534 – 537 , 578 – 581 and 632 – 652 are disordered . Electron density for loop L2 BS ( amino acids 709 – – 715 ) was only visible in the SeMet derivative structure and was therefore not modelled in the native structure . However , L2 BS was included for figure preparation . Of all resi - dues , 86 . 9 % are in the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot and no residue in the disallowed regions , as analysed with Procheck 47 . Figures were preparedwithPyMol 48 . Buriedsurfaceareas ( permolecule ) werecalculatedusing CNS 44 . Solvent - accessible areas per residue were calculated using areaimol 46 . Domain superpositions were performed with lsqkab 46 . Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL W 49 and adjusted by hand . Liposome co - sedimentation assays . Liposomes were prepared as previously described ( http : / / www . endocytosis . org ) . Folch liposomes ( total bovine brain lipids fraction I from Sigma ) in 20mM HEPES / NaOH ( pH7 . 5 ) , 150mM NaCl , 2mM KCl were extruded through a 0 . 1 m m filter . Liposomes ( 0 . 1mgml 2 1 ) were incubatedatroomtemperaturewith4 . 0 m Moftheindicateddynamin1construct for 10min in 40 m l reaction volume , followed by a 70 , 000 g spin for 10min at 20 u C . GTP hydrolysis assay . GTPase activities of 1 m M of the indicated dynamin 1 constructs were determined at 37 u C in 20mM HEPES / NaOH ( pH7 . 5 ) , 150mM NaCl , 2mM KCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , in the absence and presence of 0 . 1mgml 2 1 0 . 1 - m m - filtered Folch liposomes , using saturating concentrations of GTP as sub - strate ( 1mMforthebasaland3mMforthestimulatedreactions ) . Reactionswere initiated by the addition of protein to the reaction . At different time points , reaction aliquots were diluted 15 - fold in GTPase buffer and quickly transferred toliquidnitrogen . Nucleotidesinthesampleswereseparatedviaareversed - phase Hypersil ODS - 2 C18 column ( 250 3 4mm ) , with 10mM tetrabutylammonium bromide , 100mM potassium phosphate ( pH6 . 5 ) , 7 . 5 % acetonitrile as running buffer . Denatured proteins were adsorbed at a C18 guard column . Nucleotides were detected by absorption at 254nm and quantified by integration of the corresponding peaks . Rates were derived from a linear fit to the initial reaction ( , 40 % GTP hydrolysed ) . Transferrin uptake in HeLa cells . HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA using Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) on day 1 . The sequence of the siRNA against human dynamin 2 is 5 9 - GCAACUGACCAACCACAUC - 3 9 , targeting nucleotides 849 – 867 . Onday2 , cellsweretransfectedwithpEGFP - N1 ( Clontech ) orsiRNA - resistant rat dynamin 2 - pEGFP - N1 using lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) and seeded on coverslips . On day 3 , cells were serum - starved and incubated with 20 m gml 2 1 transferrin - Alexa568 ( MolecularProbes , Invitrogen ) for10minat37 u C . Afterfour PBS washes on ice , cells were paraformaldehyde - fixed for 20min at room temper - ature . TransferrinuptakewasanalysedusingaZeissAxiovert200Mmicroscopeand Slidebook imaging software ( 3i Inc . ) . Internalized transferrin was quantified from transfected cells only and normalized to the value of eGFP - transfected , mock - treated cells ( n 5 28 – 83 images , five independent experiments ; IHGVR395 – 399AAA , I10D , QD17 – 18AA : three independent experiments ; E368K , R369W , S619L , F372D : two independent experiments ) . Knockdown of dynamin 2 and expression levels of dynamin 2 – eGFP mutants were assessed by immunoblotting using antibodies to dynamin 2 ( a gift of M . A . McNiven ) , b - actin ( clone ac - 15 , Sigma - Aldrich ) and eGFP ( clone jl - 8 , Clontech ) . Localization of dynamin 2 – eGFP mutants . HeLa cells were transfected with dynamin 2 - pEGFP - N1 wild - type or mutant constructs 20h before fixation in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 12min at room temperature . Cells were blocked and per - meabilized in 10 % goat serum , 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 , 100mM NaCl in phosphate buffer and stained for endogenous adaptor complex AP - 2 using an antibody to a - adaptin ( clone AP - 6 , Abcam ) . Total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert200M microscope equipped with a 3 100TIRFobjectiveandadual - colourTIRFsetupfromVisitronSystemsusing Slidebook imaging software ( 3i Inc . ) . Loop modelling and molecular dynamics simulations . For modelling of the unresolved loop regions L1N S and L2 S , two stalk dimers in the constricted state served as scaffold . Using Modeller ( 9v8 ) 50 , the scaffold was fixed in position , whereas L1N S and L2 S could freely sample the empirical potential function . To reduce the conformational search space , additional harmonic distance restraints were added between conserved residues Arg399 – Asp406 and Glu355 – Arg361 . Based on the modelled stalk tetramer , five independent all - atom molecular dynamics simulations ( NVT ensemble ) , each of 90ns , were conducted at T 5 300K in a periodic boundary setting using Gromacs 4 . 5 . 3 ( ref . 51 ) . The model was immersed in a rectangular 20nm 3 10nm 3 9nm box , containing approximately 56 , 400 water molecules , 21 sodium and 17 chloride ions to neut - ralize the system , resulting in a total number of 185 , 857 atoms . As force fields , Amber99 ( protein and ions ) 52 and TIP3P ( water ) 53 were applied . To treat long - range interactions , the Particle - mesh Ewald method 54 , 55 was used . A cut - off of 1nm was used for the real parts of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions . All hydrogen bonds were constrained by using the LINCS 56 algorithm , allowing for an integration time - step of 2fs . For the thermostatted integration , Langevin dynamics were used as implemented by the Gromacs s . d . integrator ( tau _ t 5 1 ) . Forthe calculationof bendingandtwisting angles , each of thefour stalk mono - merswasrepresentedbytwogeometriccentres , definedasthemeanpositionofC a atoms of residues 366 – 377 , 420 – 430 , 468 – 481 and 671 – 683 for position A and residues 360 – 365 , 428 – 445 , 457 – 472 and 686 – 701 for position B ( Supplementary Fig . 12d ) . Thestalkbendingangle a wasdefinedasthemeananglebetweenparallel stalks , and the twisting angle b by the minimal angle between the planes spanned by each dimer ( positions A , B , B 9 in Supplementary Fig . 12f ) . For each simulation time step , the corresponding stalk tetramer structure describes a linear transformation of the first dimer onto the second dimer , con - sistingofatranslationvectorandarotationmatrix . Thislineartransformationwas used to reconstruct the structure of an ideal dynamin helix by applying it to the dynamin dimer model in the constricted state . The diameter , d , and the rise per turn , r , of these helices were measured by using the geometric centres of the stalk coordinatesandobtaining trajectories in ( d , r ) . Based on these trajectories , the free energy surface of stalk helix conformations was calculated : the two - dimensional space ( d , r ) was discretized into boxes of size 25 3 25A˚ . Based on the simulation trajectories , the transition probability between all pairs of boxes was computed , ARTICLE RESEARCH Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Whenmorethantwostalkdimersareassembled , non - cooperative behaviour of neighbouring dimers has to be considered , for example , the assembled stalk dimers can almost independently switch between different conformations . The resulting equilibrium distribution of two independ - ent tetrameric units would be given by the convolution of two single - tetramer distributions , p 2 ( d , r ) . It was found that for only about three such convolutions , theresultingprobabilitydistributionconvergesto p 3 ( d , r ) < p ( d , r ) . Thus , assuming that the helix has at least three independently switching subunits , the free energy landscape is unique , and is given by F ( d , r ) 52 k T ln ( p ( d , r ) ) , where k is the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature . 40 .
