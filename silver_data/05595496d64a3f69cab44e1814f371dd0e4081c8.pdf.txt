Brieher , Margaret Coughlin , and Timothy J . Mitchison Department of Systems Biology , Harvard University Medical School , Boston , MA 02115 ctin - dependent propulsion of Listeria monocytogenes is thought to require frequent nucleation of actin polymerization by the Arp2 / 3 complex . We demon - strate that L . monocytogenes motility can be separated into an Arp2 / 3 - dependent nucleation phase and an Arp2 / 3 - independent elongation phase . Elongation - based propulsion requires a unique set of biochemical factors in addition to those required for Arp2 / 3 - dependent motility . We isolated fascin from brain extracts as the only soluble factor required in addition to actin during the elongation phase for this A type of movement . The nucleation reaction assembles a comet tail of branched actin ﬁlaments directly behind the bacterium . The elongation - based reaction generates a hollow cylinder of parallel bundles that attach along the sides of the bacterium . Bacteria move faster in the elongation reaction than in the presence of Arp2 / 3 , and the rate is limited by the concentration of G - actin . The biochemical and structural differences between the two motility reactions imply that each operates through distinct biochemical and biophysical mechanisms . Introduction The actin cytoskeleton is a system of proteins that can perform mechanical work . In some situations , myosin motors generate the force to perform work while actin filaments provide directional tracks for myosin translocation . In others , actin polymerization itself appears to perform mechanical work . New actin polymer can be generated by creating a filament de novo from G - actin subunits in a process referred to as nucleation . Alternatively , new polymer can be generated by extending existing filaments , which we refer to as elongation . The frequency of nucleation is an important factor in determining the morphology of actin - based cellular structures ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ; Svitkina et al . , 2003 ; Vignjevic et al . , 2003 ) It may also influence the force producing mech - anisms entailed in these structures . For example , nucleation is frequent in protruding sheets termed lamellipodia ( Theriot and Mitchison , 1991 ) where actin filaments are typically short and organized in dendritic branches ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . Nucleation is less frequent in protruding cylinders such as filopodia where new polymer may be formed solely through elongation of existing filaments ( Mallavarapu and Mitchison , 1999 ) , and in these structures filaments are organized into parallel bundles ( Lewis and Bridgman , 1992 ; Svitkina et al . , 2003 ) . Although protrusion of lamellipodia ( Theriot and Mitchison , 1991 ) and filopodia ( Mallavarapu and Mitchison , 1999 ) are tightly coupled to actin polymer - ization , the distinct organization and generation of actin fila - ments in each structure raises the possibility that each might use a different mechanism to produce mechanical force . Progress on the mechanism by which actin polymerization can perform mechanical work has been facilitated by the discovery that a number of intracellular pathogens , including Listeria monocytogenes , propel themselves through the host cytoplasm by assembling an actin comet tail that grows at the tail – bacterial interface ( Cameron et al . , 2000 ; Portnoy et al . , 2002 ) . This motility mechanism is probably similar to rocketing of endocytic vesicles ( Taunton et al . , 2000 ) , and shares biochemistry with leading edge structures ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Like lamellipodial protrusion , L . monocytogenes motility is thought to be driven by frequent , Arp2 / 3 - dependent nucleation that generates a tail containing short , highly branched filaments ( Tilney and Portnoy , 1989 ; Theriot et al . , 1992 ) .

We currently lack a similarly tractable reconstituted system for dissecting the mechanism for force production by elongation - dominated structures like filopodia . Here , we show that L . monocytoge - nes can move in the absence of frequent nucleation and be - gin the biochemical and structural characterization of this form of motility . Results L . monocytogenes motility initiates from an actin cloud whose formation requires actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Welch et al . , 1997 ; May et al . , 1999 ; Yarar et al . , 1999 ) . To test if motility continues to require Arp2 / 3 activity after cloud nucleation , motility assays were performed in perfu - sion chambers . Motility could then be dissected into two steps : tail nucleation and tail elongation . We used actin tagged with different fluorophores to reveal the step during which a given segment of the comet tail polymerized . Motil - ity was initiated with cytosol containing Arp2 / 3 and green actin . This solution was then replaced with cytosol contain - ing an Arp2 / 3 inhibitor and red actin . We used the cofilin homology and acidic region of N - WASP ( CA ) domain of N - WASP to inhibit Arp2 / 3 . This domain binds Arp2 / 3 and competitively inhibits binding of Arp2 / 3 activators includ - ing the ActA protein of L . monocytogenes ( May et al . , 1999 ) . Bacteria mixed with brain cytosol formed comet tails ( Fig . 1 A ) . Addition of CA to cytosol inhibited all actin polymeriza - tion around the bacteria ( Fig . 1 B ) . However , once Arp2 / 3 initiated motility , its activity was no longer required for comet tail assembly . Motility in the absence of Arp2 / 3 - driven nucleation was evident from an additional segment of comet tail containing red actin after the initiating cytosol was replaced with cytosol containing CA ( Fig . 1 C ) . The segment of tail formed by elongation in cytosol , CA , and red actin appeared thinner , stiffer , and less fuzzy than the initial tail formed with active Arp2 / 3 . Replacing the initiating cy - tosol with CA and actin alone resulted in only a short stretch of newly assembled actin ( Fig . 1 D ) . Therefore , after initia - tion by Arp2 / 3 , comet tails continue to assemble in its ab - sence in a reaction that requires cytosolic factors in addition to actin . Actin filament arrays assembled by Arp2 / 3 - dependent nucleation are characterized by their highly branched , den - dritic organization ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ; Cameron et al . , 2001 ) . We used EM to visualize actin filament organization in comet tails assembled in the pres - ence or absence of Arp2 / 3 - nucleating activity ( Fig . 2 ) . For comparison , we first looked at the structure of L . monocytoge - nes comet tails in infected rat kangaroo ( PtK ) cells ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Comet tails assembled in vivo appeared to consist of two populations of actin filaments . A dendritic network of highly branched filaments is ensheathed by a cylinder of bun - dles running parallel to the direction of movement .

One class contained both fila - ment organizations with prominent bundles surrounding a branched interior network ( Fig . 2 C ) . The other class con - sisted almost exclusively of the branched filaments ( Fig . 2 D ) . The type of comet tail that forms is extract dependent . Of six different brain extracts , two extracts primarily formed the hy - brid tail consisting of branched as well as parallel bundles of filaments , as shown in Fig . 2 C ( 24 / 28 comet tails examined contained both filament organizations , whereas the remain - ing four comet tails contained only branched filaments ) . The other four extracts formed comet tails consisting primarily of branched filaments , as shown in Fig . 2 D ( 67 / 67 comet tails examined ) . We do not know the source of the variability be - tween cytosolic extracts . In the two - step reaction , we ob - served an abrupt structural change between the portion of the tail generated in cytosol alone and that generated in cyto - sol (cid:5) CA ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) . This structural change was inde - pendent of the type of comet tail formed in step 1 . The first part contains branched filaments , whereas the second part consists only of long bundles running parallel to the direction of movement . The bundles are still arranged into a cylinder , but now the interior is largely hollow . If the first portion of the comet tail consisted of both branched filaments and par - allel bundles , the bundles in the second portion appeared to extend off the original bundles ( Fig . 2 E ; 11 / 11 examined ) . If the first portion of the comet tail consisted solely of branched filaments , they were stitched together into parallel bundles in step 2 ( Fig . 2 F ; 23 / 23 examined ) in a manner analogous to bundle formation from a dendritic network described by Vignjevic et al . ( 2003 ) . This structural transition within comet tails is also quite similar to that seen after addition of G - actin to detergent - extracted infected cells ( Tilney et al . , 1992 ) , suggesting that our assay might be reporting on the same activity as that seen in the Tilney work . From our EM , we conclude that continued assembly of the branched net - work in the center of the tail requires Arp2 / 3 nucleation , whereas the sheath of parallel bundles can apparently elon - gate independent of frequent nucleation by Arp2 / 3 . Arp2 / 3 - dependent L . monocytogenes motility has been re - ported with seven pure proteins ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . We wished to identify the biochemical factors required for Arp2 / 3 - independent motility . We were unable to reconsti - tute Arp2 / 3 - independent motility using mixtures of known factors , and a direct fractionation approach quickly resulted in the loss of all activity even when fractions were mixed with known factors . This suggested that Arp2 / 3 - indepen - dent motility requires more than one new factor . There - fore , to facilitate its biochemical dissection , we divided L . monocytogenes motility into a set of subreactions in an at - tempt to make at least one subreaction dependent upon a single factor . We divided L . monocytogenes propulsion into three steps ( Fig . 3 A ) . In the first step , L . monocytogenes are preincubated in cytosol under conditions that prevent actin polymerization . This allows recruitment of essential factors to the bacterial surface . The second step initiates actin polymerization and motility in the presence of purified Arp2 / 3 , capping protein , and actin . In the third step , the initiating mixture is replaced with actin , CA , and brain fractions to be tested for elongation activity . All three steps are required for Arp2 / 3 - independent propulsion in step 3 , and actin alone in step 3 was not sufficient for sustained propulsion . We fractionated brain extracts to identify the additional factor required in step 3 for persistent motility . A purifica - tion scheme from brain cytosol ended with the isolation of a single polypeptide of 56 kD that was identified by mass spectrometry as the actin - bundling protein fascin ( Fig . 3 B ) . Actin (cid:5) CA (cid:5) recombinant fascin expressed in bacteria and purified was sufficient , in step 3 , to support continued comet tail assembly in the absence of Arp2 / 3 ( Fig . 3 C ) . We conclude that fascin is the only soluble protein required in addition to actin for Arp2 / 3 - independent motility . The actin - bundling proteins fimbrin ( Kocks and Cossart , 1993 ) and (cid:6) - actinin ( Dabiri et al . , 1990 ) have been local - ized to actin comet tails of L . monocytogenes . To see if fascin localized to comet tails , L . monocytogenes - infected BSC - 1 cells and XTC cells were stained for fascin ( Fig . 4 ) . Fascin localized to comet tails in both cell types . We tested other bundling proteins for their ability to sub - stitute for fascin in Arp2 / 3 - independent motility . Reactions Figure 3 .

Bars : ( A ) 5 (cid:4) m ; ( C ) 1 (cid:4) m . 236 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 165 , Number 2 , 2004 were performed using the three - step protocol described above , but using either fascin , fimbrin , (cid:6) - actinin , or filamin in step 3 ( the elongation step ) . All of these bundling proteins scored in the reaction when present at 1 (cid:4) M ( Fig . 5 ) . For each bundling protein , (cid:1) 30 – 40 % of the bacteria that as - sembled clouds or comet tails in step 2 elongated in step 3 ( for fascin , 68 / 210 ; fimbrin , 54 / 177 ; (cid:6) - actinin , 36 / 91 ; fil - amin , 24 / 83 ) . Therefore , Arp2 / 3 - independent elongation requires bundling of actin filaments , but is not a unique property of fascin . To gain insight into the biophysical mechanisms involved in propulsion , comet tails assembled under Arp2 / 3 - depen - dent and - independent conditions were visualized by thin - section EM . Incubating bacteria in Arp2 / 3 and actin alone resulted in the formation of actin clouds containing highly branched filaments ( Fig . 6 A ) . Bacteria assembled comet tails after preincubation in cytosol in the presence of actin , Arp2 / 3 , and capping protein . Filaments under these condi - tions are short and highly branched with no bundles or long filaments visible ( Fig . 6 B ) . Filament organization under these conditions matches that seen in the presence of Arp2 / 3 and actin alone , the main difference being the assembly of a comet tail as opposed to a symmetric cloud . This demon - strates that L . monocytogenes moving under these conditions undergo frequent rounds of Arp2 / 3 - mediated nucleation . When the nucleation mix is replaced with fascin , CA , and actin , the organization of the comet tail switches abruptly to bundles of filaments parallel to the direction movement ( Fig . 6 C ) . Higher magnification views of the nucleation - based reaction show a high concentration of branched fila - ments directly behind the bacteria ( Fig . 6 D ) . In contrast , in the elongation reaction filaments make extensive lateral con - tacts with the bacterial surface , but very few filaments are lo - calized behind it ( Fig . 6 E ) . Because Arp2 / 3 has previously been considered central to L . monocytogenes propulsion , we took several steps to test if bundling - mediated elongation is truly independent of nucle - ation by Arp2 / 3 . We performed a dose – response analysis of CA inhibition for the nucleation phase ( step 2 ) and elonga - tion phase ( step 3 ) of our reaction ( Fig . 7 A ) . The Arp2 / 3 - dependent nucleation phase was sensitive to CA inhibition with an IC50 of (cid:1) 0 . 5 (cid:4) M , whereas CA did not inhibit the fascin - dependent elongation step at concentrations tested up to 15 (cid:4) M . Second , we tested the effect of a nonhydrolyz - able ATP analogue , adenosine 5 (cid:1) - ( (cid:2) , (cid:3) - imido ) triphosphate ( AMPPNP ; Fig . 7 B ) . AMPPNP inhibits nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex by blocking an activation step , but has no effect on the association of Arp2 / 3 with ActA ( Dayel et al . , 2001 ) . In that experiment , AMPPNP blocked Arp2 / 3 - depen - dent nucleation when present at 50 - fold molar excess of AMPPNP over ATP , whereas actin polymerization in the first 2 min was not affected by the nucleotide in solution . After that , ATP bound to actin exchanges with nucleotide in solution and further polymerization is inhibited ( Selden et al . , 1999 ) . In the Listeria assay , AMPPNP inhibited cloud formation with an IC50 of (cid:1) 0 . 75 (cid:4) M which , under these assay conditions , is in 30 - fold molar excess of ATP in solu - tion in the nucleation step and 60 - fold excess in the elonga - tion step . In the three - step assay , we normally can readily detect cloud formation within the first 60 – 90 s after Arp2 / 3 and actin are introduced into the chamber in step 2 . There - fore , inhibition of cloud formation by AMPPNP is likely due to inhibition of Arp2 / 3 activation . In contrast , elonga - tion was insensitive to AMPPNP up to 4 mM . Each of these results , as well as the absence of branched filaments in the Figure 4 . Fascin localizes to comet tails in L . monocytogenes – infected cells . Infected BSC - 1 cells ( A and B ) or XTC cells ( C and D ) were costained for actin ( A and C ) and fascin ( B and D ) . Bar , 10 (cid:4) m . Figure 5 .

Arp2 / 3 - independent Listeria motility | Brieher et al . 237 fascin - mediated reaction , argue that the fascin - mediated elongation phase , once initiated , is independent of Arp2 / 3 - nucleating activity . To test if Arp2 / 3 might play a role other than nucleation in the elongation phase , we introduced Arp2 / 3 labeled with a green fluorophore in step 2 and as - sessed its localization after elongation with fascin in step 3 ( Fig . 7 C ) . Arp2 / 3 localized to the portion of the comet tail assembled in the nucleation phase ( step 2 ) , but was not de - tected in the tail extension generated in the presence of fas - cin and CA in step 3 nor at the bacterial surface . In all of the previous experiments , motility was inferred from morphology by the appearance of a long segment of red actin extending away from the green tail assembled in the presence of Arp2 / 3 . To directly measure motility , we used time - lapse phase - contrast or differential interference contrast imaging in the same three - step assay in perfusion chambers . When bacteria are preincubated in cytosol and step 3 contains fascin and actin , the bacteria move at nearly constant rates ( (cid:1) 2 (cid:4) m / min ) for 6 min before they start to decelerate ( Fig . 8 , A and B ) . The deceleration is due to de - pletion of actin or fascin from solution because refreshing the perfusion mixture promoted a new round of elongation on a subset of the bacteria ( unpublished data ) . In contrast , when step 3 contains actin alone , the bacteria move only a short distance ( to a maximum of 4 (cid:4) m ) before they stop ( Fig . 8 , A and B ) . In either the presence of fascin (cid:5) actin or actin alone , bacteria rarely detached from the comet tail . From these experiments , we conclude that an actin cross - linking protein is required for persistent movement in the absence of Arp2 / 3 , but actin alone is sufficient for a short burst of motility . To further characterize the nucleation - and elongation - driven reactions , we compared the rates of L . monocytogenes motility of all our different reactions as a function of G - actin concentration ( Fig . 9 ) . First , we tested motility in the pres - ence of Arp2 / 3 , VASP , capping protein , and actin in the ab - sence of a cytosol preincubation . This is similar to the de - fined system for L . monocytogenes motility ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) , but it lacks profilin and cofilin so the F - actin is not depolymerizing or recycling , and the concentration of G - actin is not buffered . Under these conditions , L . monocytogenes move at a rate of 0 . 5 – 1 (cid:4) m / min regardless of the G - actin concentration ( 1 – 16 (cid:4) M ) . When this mixture is replaced Figure 6 .

Bar , 10 (cid:4) m . 238 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 165 , Number 2 , 2004 with fascin and actin , all movement stops . If , instead , the bacteria are preincubated with cytosol and then mixed with Arp2 / 3 , capping protein , and actin ( equivalent to step 2 in our three - step reaction ) , they move faster than in the defined system . The rate depends on actin concentration at low G - actin concentrations and plateaus above 4 (cid:4) M . L . mono - cytogenes move faster still when this mixture is replaced with fascin and actin ( equivalent to step 3 in the three - step reac - tion ) , and the rate depends on the actin concentration at all of the concentrations tested . Thus , elongation - based motil - ity is faster than Arp2 / 3 - dependent motility . The elongation reaction absolutely requires one or more unknown factors that can bind to the bacterial surface , and these factors facil - itate Arp2 / 3 - dependent motility . Discussion L . monocytogenes motility can be experimentally separated into an Arp2 / 3 - dependent nucleation phase and an Arp2 / 3 - independent elongation phase . Elongation - mediated pro - pulsion , unlike propulsion mediated by frequent nucleation , requires an actin - bundling protein and an unknown factor that associates with the bacterial surface . Each biochemical mechanism generates a distinct comet tail structure . The ad - ditional biochemical requirements , alternative filament or - ganization , and different dependence of rate on G - actin con - centration all suggest that elongation - driven motility is not a simple continuation of the Arp2 / 3 - mediated reaction . We surmise that the mechanical mechanisms for generating force likely differ in the two reactions . Although the biophysical mechanism by which actin poly - merization drives propulsion is not known for Arp2 / 3 - dependent motility , it has been subject to extensive theoreti - cal analysis ( Merz and Higgs , 2003 ; Mogilner and Oster , 2003b ; Upadhyaya and van Oudenaarden , 2003 ) . Growing barbed ends near the bacterial surface are thought to either push or squeeze the bacteria forward or prevent it from dif - fusing backward . Comet tails generated by frequent Arp2 / 3 - dependent nucleation contain a number of filaments directly behind the bacteria that are properly positioned to push as they grow . It is not clear whether these models can account Figure 8 . L . monocytogenes motility in the fascin - dependent elongation phase .

Bacteria were preincubated in either VASP or brain cytosol ( step 1 ) . To initiate motility , the preincubation solution was replaced with Arp2 / 3 , actin , and capping protein ( step 2 ) . For motility in the absence of Arp2 / 3 , the nucleating solution in step 2 was replaced with a solution containing actin , fascin , and CA ( step 3 ) . Motility rates in the Arp2 / 3 - dependent reaction were analyzed in step 2 . Rates in the fascin - dependent elongation reaction were analyzed in step 3 .

Arp2 / 3 - independent Listeria motility | Brieher et al . 239 for force production in the elongation - mediated reaction where very few filaments are localized behind bacteria . Dur - ing elongation , the vast majority of filaments are bundled and bound to the sides of the bacteria . Despite the fact that these filaments are not positioned to push or prevent backward diffusion in the manner predicted by the elastic Brownian ratchet ( Mogilner and Oster , 2003a ) , bacteria in fact move faster under elongation conditions than nucle - ation conditions . One reason for faster motility during elon - gation might be the absence of friction between the comet tail and the bacteria that normally limits the rate of motility in the presence of Arp2 / 3 . Deformation of liposomes coated with ActA revealed a pulling force at the rear that retards forward movement ( Giardini et al . , 2003 ) . Under elonga - tion - driven conditions there are no filaments behind the bacteria , so this pulling force may not exist . Thus , actin po - lymerization becomes rate limiting . The implication of the structural data is that the elonga - tion reaction generates mechanical force using filaments bound to the bacterial surface along the side of the filament . If a myosin motor were attached to the surface of the bacte - ria , it could use ATP hydrolysis to walk up the laterally at - tached bundles . However , the elongation reaction is resis - tant to high concentrations of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPNP . In addition , we have not detected a myosin using a pan - myosin antibody in fractions enriched in the Listeria - bound factor , which is required for elonga - tion , on Western blots . Therefore , we consider a myosin - based transport mechanism for L . monocytogenes propulsion highly unlikely even for our Arp2 / 3 - independent elongation reaction . The strong requirement for a bundling protein provides clues as to the biophysical mechanism of the elongation re - action . One possible function of fascin is simply to establish a stable base such that force generated by actin polymeriza - tion can be used for useful work . In the absence of a bun - dling protein , filaments longer than 30 – 150 nm would sim - ply buckle under a load , and thus could not generate force in the Mogilner and Oster Brownian ratchet model ( Mogilner and Oster , 1996 ) . Arp2 / 3 repeatedly supplies a new popula - tion of branched , short filaments that are capable of exerting force which might explain the lack of a requirement for a bundling protein when it is present . An alternative interpretation of the fascin requirement is that bundling plays a more direct role in force production . Bundling the filaments comprising the hollow cylinder as - sembled by the elongation reaction could squeeze the bacte - ria forward . Compressive forces are considered to drive mo - tility in an elastic model of L . monocytogenes propulsion ( Gerbal et al . , 2000 ) , and such forces have been shown to be exerted on ActA - coated liposomes ( Giardini et al . , 2003 ; Upadhyaya et al . , 2003 ) . We would favor such a mechanism if the comet tail assembled by the elongation showed any sign of collapsing behind the bacteria , but this is not seen . As an alternative , we consider a Brownian ratchet in which dif - fusion is rectified by bundling ( Fig . 10 ) . In this model , we hypothesize that individual filaments form weak attach - ments to the bacterial surface , but bundling of filaments is incompatible with attachment to the surface . Therefore , as bundling proceeds to form energetically favorable bonds , the bacterium diffuses forward to form favorable bonds with in - dividual filaments growing in front of it . The total number of bonds in the system is maximized by forward movement of the bacterium . We have found that other actin cross - link - ing proteins such as fimbrin , (cid:6) - actinin , and filamin can sub - stitute for fascin in the elongation reaction . Perhaps compar - ing quantitative differences between the different bundling factors to formal models of force generation , in addition to identification of the unknown factor , can help distinguish the mechanism of elongation - driven motility . Beyond its biophysical interest , is the elongation reaction physiologically significant for L . monocytogenes biology ? Our EM of L . monocytogenes in infected cells and crude extracts suggests that physiological comet tails are typically sur - rounded by a sheath of bundled actin filaments . Polarization microscopy observations ( Zhukarev et al . , 1995 ) and EM of L . monocytogenes in protrusions ( Sechi et al . , 1997 ) are con - sistent with the presence of such a sheath . Our three - step as - say suggests that this sheath is generated by the elongation reaction , whereas the gel inside the sheath is generated by Arp2 / 3 - driven nucleation . The sheath might provide extra force for propulsion or may simply stiffen the comet tail . The morphology of comet tails we observed in the Arp2 / 3 - driven and elongation reactions shows that the persistence length of the fascin - bundled sheath is much longer than the Arp2 / 3 cross - linked , branched gel , as expected from their structures . In infected cells , L . monocytogenes motility ceases and protrusions withdraw when the cells are injected with fragments of (cid:6) - actinin ( Dold et al . , 1994 ) . Therefore , comet tail stiffness might be important when L . monocytogenes needs to deform the plasma membrane in a filopodium - like protrusion , where the stiffness of the plasma membrane and submembranous cortex is opposing the stiffness of the comet tail . Unidirectional persistence of motility might also be important for the infectious life cycle because the effi - Figure 10 . A Brownian ratchet model for bundling - mediated motility of L . monocytogenes . Individual filaments form weak attachments with the bacterial surface . However , incorporation of filaments into bundles is incompatible with their binding to the bacterial surface . Moving the bacteria to the right maximizes the number of favorable bonds because it can attach to growing individual filaments while leaving bundled filaments behind it . The bacteria is blue . Green lines represent actin and red lines newly polymerized actin . Bundling proteins are represented as black ovals . 240 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 165 , Number 2 , 2004 ciency of bacterial invasion between cells has been shown to correlate more with the unidirectional persistence of bacte - rial motility than with motility rate ( Monack and Theriot , 2001 ) . Testing the physiological significance of the elonga - tion reaction will require depletion experiments in cells . De - pletion of all bundling proteins in cells will be difficult , so the best approach may be to identify the missing Listeria - bound factor ( s ) that are required for the elongation reaction , and to test the effect of depleting it on L . monocytogenes biol - ogy . Identification of this factor ( s ) would also help elucidate the physiological process L . monocytogenes is hijacking to perform the elongation reaction . Materials and methods Protein purification Actin ( Pardee and Spudich , 1982 ) and CapZ ( Casella and Cooper , 1991 ) were purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described . Arp2 / 3 was puri - fied from bovine brain as described previously ( Egile et al . , 1999 ) . Recom - binant , 6His - tagged VASP ( a gift from Frederick Southwick , University from Florida College of Medicine , Gainesville , FL ) expressed in Sf9 cells with baculovirus was purified on nickel chelating resin followed by gel fil - tration on a Superdex™ 200 column . Recombinant fascin ( a gift from Pierre McCrea , M . D . Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX ) was purified as a thioredoxin fusion protein from bacteria ( Tao et al . , 1996 ) by conven - tional chromatography . Bacterial extracts were prepared in 20 mM Pipes , pH 6 . 8 , 50 mM KCl , and 5 mM (cid:2) - mercaptoethanol ( (cid:2) - Me ) . The extract was centrifuged for 1 h at 108 , 000 g . The supernatant was passed through a 2 (cid:8) 5 - ml DEAE HiTrap™ column linked in tandem that flowed into a 5 - ml S HiTrap™ column ( Amersham Biosciences ) . The flow - through from these linked columns was dialyzed against 20 mM MES , pH 6 . 0 , and 5 mM (cid:2) - Me , applied to a Mono S 5 / 5 column , and eluted with a 20 - ml gra - dient to 300 mM KCl in the dialyzing buffer . Fascin – thioredoxin eluted around 75 – 120 mM KCl . Fascin - positive fractions were gel filtered on a 16 / 60 Superdex™ 200 column equilibrated in 20 mM Pipes , pH 6 . 8 , 100 mM KCl , and 5 mM (cid:2) - Me . Recombinant fimbrin was a gift from Paul Mat - sudaira ( MIT , Cambridge , MA ) . To purify recombinant fimbrin from bacte - ria , lysates were prepared in 20 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , and 5 mM (cid:2) - Me . The 108 , 000 g supernatant was precipitated with 30 – 70 % ammonium sulfate and the pellet was resuspended in 20 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , and 5 mM (cid:2) - Me . After dialyzing against the same buffer , the sample was applied to a 2 (cid:8) 5 - ml DEAE HiTrap™ column . The column was eluted with a 15 - volume gradient to 500 mM KCl in the same buffer . Fractions containing fimbrin were precipitated with 70 % ammonium sulfate , pelleted , resus - pended in 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , and 5 mM (cid:2) - Me , and applied to a 16 / 60 Superdex™ 200 column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM KCl , and 5 mM (cid:2) - Me . Positive fractions were pooled , diluted fourfold in 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , and applied to a Mono Q 5 / 5 column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , and 5 mM (cid:2) - Me . The column was eluted with a 20 - ml gradi - ent to 400 mM KCl in the same buffer . Fimbrin eluted between 180 and 200 mM KCl . (cid:6) - Actinin and filamin were purified from chicken gizzard as described previously ( Feramisco and Burridge , 1980 ) . Protein labeling Actin was labeled with either tetramethylrhodamine ( TMR ) or Alexa ® 488 N - hydroxysuccinimide esters as described previously ( Kellogg et al . , 1988 ) , except 0 . 6 M KI was used for the first depolymerization step after the labeling reaction . Arp2 / 3 was labeled with Alexa ® 488 maleimide as described previously ( Zalevsky et al . , 2001 ) . Working stocks of labeled G - actin were prepared by mixing 2 (cid:4) l of a 6 - mg / ml solution of G - actin la - beled 1 : 2 to 1 : 3 ( fluorophores / actin ) with 25 (cid:4) l unlabeled G - actin at 6 mg / ml . Motility assays L . monocytogenes were labeled with DAPI , killed with iodoacetamide , and stored at (cid:9) 80 (cid:10) C as described previously ( Welch and Mitchison , 1998 ) . Perfusion chambers were assembled from glass slides , glass cover - slips , and double - stick tape . Bacteria were diluted into assay buffer ( 20 mM Pipes , pH 6 . 8 , 75 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , and 5 mM (cid:2) - Me ) , in - troduced into the chamber , and absorbed to the glass for 10 min . Two - step assays . For two - step reactions in total cytosol , 100 , 000 g brain supernatants were diluted 1 : 5 in assay buffer , and alexa ® 488 – labeled G - actin , from a working stock solution described above , was added to 5 (cid:4) M . After 5 min , the solution in the chamber was replaced with the same dilution of cytosol , but with 5 (cid:4) M TMR - labeled actin and 5 (cid:4) M CA - GST ( a gift from Terry Lechler and Rong Li , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA ) . Three - step assays . 100 , 000 g brain supernatants were diluted 1 : 5 in assay buffer and introduced into perfusion chambers containing absorbed bacte - ria ( step 1 ) . After a 10 - min incubation at 4 (cid:10) C , the chamber was rinsed twice with one chamber volume each of assay buffer before introducing a solution containing 0 . 3 (cid:4) M Arp2 / 3 , 5 (cid:4) M Alexa ® 488 – labeled actin , and 2 nM CapZ ( step 2 ) in assay buffer . After 5 min , the chamber was washed twice with assay buffer followed by a solution containing 5 (cid:4) M TMR - labeled actin , 5 (cid:4) M CA - GST , and an appropriate dilution of fractions from bovine brain ( step 3 ) or 1 (cid:4) M recombinant fascin , fimbrin , (cid:6) - actinin , or fil - amin . Extension of the comet tail under elongation conditions in step 3 was assessed after 5 min . Images of the reactions were acquired on a microscope ( model E800 ; Nikon ) equipped with a cooled CCD camera ( Princeton Instruments ) using MetaMorph ® acquisition software ( Universal Imaging Corp . ) . Images were taken with a 60 (cid:8) 1 . 4 NA oil objective . Purification of fascin from bovine brain Freshly isolated bovine calf brains were homogenized in a Waring type blender in 100 ml buffer A ( 20 mM Pipes , pH 6 . 8 , 25 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM (cid:2) - Me , and 0 . 2 mM PMSF ) per 100 g of tissue . Fascin was pu - rified from a 100 , 000 g supernatant of bovine brain by passing the material over S - Sepharose HP ( Amersham Biosciences ) in buffer A . The column was eluted with a gradient from 0 to 350 mM KCl in buffer A . The flow - through contained all the activity required for step 3 and was used for puri - fication of fascin . The bound material contained all nucleating activity and was used to purify Arp2 / 3 . The S flow - through was dialyzed into buffer B ( buffer A , but with 20 mM MES , pH 6 . 0 ) and was reapplied to the S col - umn in buffer B and eluted with a 15 - column volume gradient from 0 to 350 mM KCl . Active fractions were desalted back into buffer A on Sepha - dex G - 25 and were applied to a heparin sulfate column equilibrated in buffer A . The column was eluted with a 15 - column volume gradient from 0 to 750 ml KCl . Active fractions were dialyzed into buffer A and added to a threefold protein mass excess of phalloidin - stabilized actin filaments . The sample was incubated on ice for 60 min before collecting the actin fil - aments and associated proteins by centrifugation at 100 , 000 g for 30 min in a TLA100 . 3 rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) . The pellet was washed 2 (cid:8) in buffer A , and was then homogenized in 1 M KCl in buffer A . The actin was pelleted and the supernatant was desalted on Sephadex G - 25 into buffer A before being applied to a 1 - ml Q HiTrap™ column equilibrated in buffer A . Fascin flows through the column under these conditions . CA and AMPPNP inhibition of Arp2 / 3 - nucleating activity Listeria absorbed to glass in perfusion chambers were preincubated in cy - tosol for 10 min , and the chamber was washed twice as above . To assess inhibition of Arp2 / 3 - dependent nucleation , the chamber was filled with 0 . 3 (cid:4) M Arp2 / 3 , 2 nM capping protein , and 5 (cid:4) M Alexa ® 488 – labeled ac - tin in assay buffer containing varying concentrations of CA - GST . Nucle - ation of clouds and comet tails was assessed by fluorescence microscopy after 10 min . CA inhibition of elongation was determined by adding vary - ing amounts of CA - GST to the elongation reaction solution containing 1 (cid:4) M fascin and 5 (cid:4) M TMR - labeled actin . Elongation was assessed by fluo - rescence microscopy after 5 min . Inhibition by AMPPNP was performed in essentially the same way , except that ATP was omitted from the assay buffer during the step in which AMPPNP was used . Therefore , the only ATP in the buffer at that time comes from the actin and Arp2 / 3 solutions . For each concentration of CA - GST or AMPPNP , three random 40 (cid:8) fields were photographed in two separate experiments , and the average num - ber of bacteria with associated clouds or tails or elongated tails was determined . Motility rates The rate of elongation in the presence and absence of fascin was deter - mined in perfusion chambers in a three - step reaction as described above . After preincubation in cytosol , initiation in Arp2 / 3 , actin , and capping pro - tein , and a buffer wash , the chamber was filled with assay buffer contain - ing 5 (cid:4) M CA - GST and 5 (cid:4) M actin with or without 1 (cid:4) M fascin . Motility was recorded by time - lapse microscopy during this third step using either phase - contrast or differential interference contrast optics acquiring an im - age every 30 s . Rates and distances were determined using the “Track Ob - jects” feature on MetaMorph ® . Motility rates as a function of G - actin concentration were determined in perfusion chambers in either a two - or three - step reaction . Bacteria were Arp2 / 3 - independent Listeria motility | Brieher et al . 241 either preincubated in cytosol diluted in assay buffer as described above , or in 2 (cid:4) M recombinant VASP in assay buffer with 4 mg / ml casein . After preincubation and washing , reactions were initiated with Arp2 / 3 , capping protein , and the indicated concentration of G - actin . To determine rates in the presence of Arp2 / 3 , motility was assessed in this second step . To deter - mine rates in the elongation phase , the initiating solution was replaced af - ter a 5 - min incubation with fascin , CA , and the indicated concentration of G - actin . Infection of cultured cells For EM , PtK cells were cultured on aclar plastic . Discs of aclar were glow discharged , coated with polylysine , and washed extensively with water be - fore the addition of PtK cells . After an overnight incubation , PtK cells were infected with L . monocytogenes for 90 min , washed into fresh media con - taining 50 (cid:4) g / ml gentamicin , and incubated at 37 (cid:10) C for 4 h before fixation and processing for EM . For immunofluorescence , BSC - 1 cells or XTC cells were cultured on polylysine - coated glass coverslips , infected with L . monocytogenes for 3 h , washed into media containing 50 (cid:4) g / ml gentamicin , and incubated at 37 (cid:10) C for an additional 4 h . The cells were fixed in methanol and costained for fascin using an anti - fascin mAb ( clone 55K - 2 ; DakoCytomation ) , and for actin using an anti - actin rabbit pAb ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Electron microscopy Infected PtK cells were rinsed twice with PBS and permeabilized for 3 min with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in 20 mM Pipes , pH 6 . 8 , and 100 mM KCl . The cells were then fixed with 50 mM lysine and 3 % glutaraldehyde in 50 mM cacodylate , pH 7 . 0 , for 5 min , and then with 3 % glutaraldehyde in ca - codylate buffer . Samples were postfixed after three rinses in cacodylate with 1 % osmium and 0 . 8 % K 3 Fe ( CN ) 6 in cacodylate buffer for 15 min on ice . After three rinses in cacodylate and two rinses in water , samples were stained with 1 % uranyl acetate for at least 2 h . Samples were rinsed twice with water and then were dehydrated with an ethanol series from 35 to 100 % ethanol while progressively lowering the temperature from 4 to (cid:9) 40 (cid:10) C . Samples were embedded in Epon - Araldite and were thin sectioned . For in vitro EM , motility reactions were performed in perfusion cham - bers consisting of a glass slide and an aclar coverslip . Bacteria were incu - bated in the chamber with the coverslip down to encourage absorption to the plastic coverslip . Motility reactions were performed as described above and were then fixed and processed for thin - section EM as described above .
