E . coli O157 : H7 is the most prevalent serotype associated with HUS and produces a variety of virulence factors being Stx2 the responsible of the most HUS severe cases . After intestinal colonization by STEC , Stx2 is released into the intestinal lumen , translocated to the circulatory system and then binds to its receptor , globotriaosylceramide ( Gb3 ) , in target cells . Thus , Stx2 passage through the colonic epithelial barrier is a key step in order to produce disease , being its mechanisms still poorly understood . We have previously reported that STEC interaction with the human colonic mucosa enhanced Stx2 production . In the present work , we have demonstrated that infection with O157 : H7 1 stx2 , a mutant unable to produce Stx2 , enhanced either Stx2 cytotoxicity on an intestinal cell line ( HCT - 8 ) , or translocation across HCT - 8 monolayers . Moreover , we found that translocation was enhanced by both paracellular and transcellular pathways . Using speciﬁc endocytosis inhibitors , we have further demonstrated that the main mechanisms implicated on Stx2 endocytosis and translocation , either when O157 : H7 1 stx2 was present or not , were Gb3 - dependent , but dynamin - independent . On the other hand , dynamin dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis became more relevant only when O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection was present . Overall , this study highlights the effects of STEC infection on the intestinal epithelial cell host and the mechanisms underlying Stx2 endocytosis , cytotoxic activity and translocation , in the aim of ﬁnding new tools toward a therapeutic approach . Keywords : shiga toxin , HCT - 8 , STEC , O157 , endocytosis , cytotoxicity , transcytosis , translocation INTRODUCTION Shiga toxin - producing Escherichia coli ( STEC ) strains are responsible for multiple clinical syndromes including bloody diarrhea , hemorrhagic colitis , and hemolytic uremic syndrome ( HUS ) ( Karmali et al . , 1985 ) . HUS is a systemic disease that can be fatal and is developed several days after STEC infection in up to 15 % of children infected ( Tarr et al . , 2005 ) . Garimano et al . STEC Infection Modulates Stx2 Action HUS is characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy , hemolytic anemia , thrombocytopenia , and acute renal failure ( Gianantonio et al . , 1968 ; Boyce et al . , 2002 ) . STEC are usually carried by cattle and bacterial ingestion frequently occurs via contaminated undercooked meat , unpasteurized dairy products , contaminated fruits , vegetables and water , and through animal to person or person to person contact ( Ferens and Hovde , 2011 ) . E . coli O157 : H7 is the most prevalent serotype associated with HUS although multiple serotypes of STEC , including O157 : NM strains and non - O157 serotypes such as O26 : H11 , O103 : H2 , O111 : NM , O121 : H19 , and O145 : NM have been associated with hemorrhagic colitis cases ( Karmali et al . , 2003 ) . Some STEC strains commonly associated with serious disease possess a chromosomal pathogenicity island known as the locus of enterocyte eﬀacement ( LEE ) ( Nataro and Kaper , 1998 ) , though LEE - negative strains which encode additional virulence , and colonization factors have also been associated with severe disease ( Newton et al . , 2009 ; Beutin and Martin , 2012 ; McWilliams and Torres , 2014 ) . The genes encoded in the LEE are responsible for intimate adhesion of STEC to colonic epithelial cells ( McWilliams and Torres , 2014 ) , which is followed by injection of bacterial eﬀector proteins into the host cell through a type III secretion system ( T3SS ) ( Jerse et al . , 1990 ) . These eﬀector proteins produce attaching and eﬀacing ( A / E ) lesions on intestinal cells and interfere with host cells in many ways , inducing a profound rearrangement of cell cytoskeleton , and a loss of tight junction and membrane integrity ( Knutton et al . , 1989 ; Holmes et al . , 2010 ; Ugalde - Silva et al . , 2016 ) . Additionally , STEC can produce either Stx1 and / or Stx2 prototypes , for which both have multiple subtypes ( Melton - Celsa , 2014 ) . Stx2 is widely recognized as the most important virulence factor of E . coli O157 : H7 responsible for HUS ( Palermo et al . , 2009 ) . This toxin is an AB5 toxin composed of an A subunit ( Stx2A ) and ﬁve B subunits ( Stx2B ) . Stx2A possesses a N - glycosidase activity against 28S rRNA of 60S ribosomes in the cytosol . This activity results in an inhibition of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and activation of a proinﬂammatory signaling cascade known as the ribotoxic stress response , which is also involved in apoptosis induction ( Smith et al . , 2003 ) . On the other hand , Stx2B is arranged as pentamers of identical composition and has high aﬃnity to the cell surface , glucosylceramide derived glycolipids , globotriaosylceramide ( Gb3 ) and globotetraosylceramide ( Gb4 ) , though it has been found that only Gb3 may act as a functional receptor ( Zumbrun et al . , 2010 ) . These glycolipids are generally located in cholesterol - rich cell membrane microdomains denominated lipid rafts ( Hanashima et al . , 2008 ; Legros et al . , 2018 ) and are associated with toxin entry into target cells . Stx2 internalization has been shown to occur in two ways , one requiring speciﬁc binding of Stx2 to Gb3 receptor ( Sandvig et al . , 2002 ) and an unspeciﬁc macropinocytic pathway ( Malyukova et al . , 2009 ; Lukyanenko et al . , 2011 ; In et al . , 2013 ) . Gb3 availability and microdomain location ( Betz et al . , 2011 ) and actin organization ( Gaus et al . , 2010 ) have been found to play a central role on Stx internalization . These factors are relevant on the mechanisms preceding endocytosis , as they impact clustering of Stx - Gb3 complexes on the cell membrane ( Pezeshkian et al . , 2017 ) and its capacity to ultimately form tubular invaginations prior to toxin internalization ( Römer et al . , 2007 ) . The last step required for toxin internalization is vesicular scission , which has been found to occur via clathrin and dynamin ( Lauvrak , 2004 ) , dynamin only ( Römer et al . , 2007 ) , and / or actin and cholesterol ( Gaus et al . , 2010 ) dependent mechanisms . Several mechanisms for toxin translocation across intestinal epithelium have been proposed . Non - Gb3 associated translocation has been found to occur via the paracellular pathway , stimulated by neutrophil transmigration and actin rearrangements during STEC infection ( Hurley et al . , 2001 ) , but also via the transcellular pathway , implicating an unspeciﬁc macropinocytic mechanism that does not involve the Gb3 receptor ( Lukyanenko et al . , 2011 ) . There is also evidence that Stx2 transcellular transcytosis may be due to Gb3 - linked Stx2 endocytosis , as it was described that a percentage of apical recycling endosomes containing Stx2 are released on the basolateral side ( Müller et al . , 2017 ) , although Gb3 presence on colonic epithelium is still under debate ( Schüller et al . , 2004 ; Zumbrun et al . , 2010 ) . Previous studies have described that these routes can be selectively and eﬃciently inhibited ( Macia et al . , 2006 ; Huang et al . , 2010 ; Koivusalo et al . , 2010 ; Dutta and Donaldson , 2012 ; Shayman , 2013 ; Kaissarian et al . , 2018 ) , even though their particular relevance to Stx2 endocytosis and translocation is still unclear . In vitro studies using human intestinal epithelial cell lines have demonstrated that epithelial cell infection with STEC may lead to enhanced Stx2 translocation depending on the strain virulence proﬁle ( Tran et al . , 2018 ) . In turn , intestinal epithelial cell - derived molecules could also modify STEC virulence by increasing adhesion and upregulating virulent genetic proﬁles ( Bansal et al . , 2013 ) . In our previous work , we investigated the eﬀect of E . coli O157 : H7 expressing Stx2 on human colonic mucosa and showed that bacterial interaction with colonic epithelium enhanced Stx2 production that , in turn , caused a marked inhibition of water absorption concomitant with histological damages on the surface epithelium ( Albanese et al . , 2015 ) . In this study , we analyze the eﬀects of E . coli O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection on Stx2 cytotoxic eﬀects , endocytosis and translocation across polarized HCT - 8 cells , which express Gb3 and Gb4 receptors ( Kouzel et al . , 2017 ) . To this aim , we used speciﬁc endocytosis inhibitors , in order to demonstrate which pathways are stimulated upon infection , providing an in vitro basis to further develop therapeutic targets . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Puriﬁed Stx2a was provided from Phoenix Laboratory ( Tufts Medical Center , Boston , MA , USA ) . Eliglustat ( Cerdelga , Sanoﬁs - Genzyme ) used as an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase ( Shayman , 2013 ) was purchased from MedKoo Biosci , Morrisville , USA . Dynasore , a speciﬁc dynamin - mediated endocytic inhibitor ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) , Methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) , a membrane cholesterol extractor ( Zidovetzki and Levitan , 2007 ) , and Amiloride hydrochloride , a macropinocytosis inhibitor ( Koivusalo et al . , 2010 ) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA . A ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 2 November 2019 | Volume 9 | Article 396 Garimano et al . STEC Infection Modulates Stx2 Action ( FITC ) - labeled Dextran ( average molecular weight of 70 kDa , Sigma Aldrich , catalog # 46945 ) was used as a marker of paracellular permeability ( Chattopadhyay et al . , 2017 ) . A mouse monoclonal antibody against the A - subunit of Stx2 ( Mab 2E11 ) was provided by Roxane Piazza ( Butantan Institute , São Paulo , SP , Brazil ) ( Rocha et al . , 2012 ) and an Alexa 647 - conjugated anti - mouse secondary antibody ( AbCam , catalog # ab150115 ) were used for ﬂow cytometry . Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions E . coli O157 : H7 strain 125 / 99 wild type ( O157 : H7 ) isolated from a patient with HUS has been previously described ( Rivas et al . , 2006 ) . A mutant lacking stx2 gene from the parenteral E . coli O157 : H7 strain 125 / 99wt ( O157 : H7 1 stx2 ) was previously obtained ( Albanese et al . , 2015 ) . O157 : H7 1 stx2 was grown in Luria Broth medium for 18 h at 37 ◦ C with shaking at 150 rpm and then diluted 1 / 10 in DMEM / F12 medium ( Sigma Aldrich , USA ) with the addition of HEPES 10 mM and grown to exponential phase ( OD 600 = 0 . 3 – 0 . 4 ) at 37 ◦ C with shaking at 150 rpm . O157 : H7 1 stx2 density corresponded to ∼ 4 × 10 9 colony - forming units per ml ( CFU / ml ) . O157 : H7 1 stx2 supernatant ( SN O157 : H7 ) was collected after centrifugation at 10 , 000 g for 5 min , followed by ﬁltration through a 0 . 22 - µ m ﬁlter ( Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) . Cell Cultures The human intestinal cell line HCT - 8 ( ATCC CCL - 244 , Manassas , VA , USA ) was maintained in RPMI - 1640 medium ( ATCC ) and the monkey kidney cell line Vero ( ATCC CCL - 81 ) was grown in DMEM / F12 ( Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO USA ) . Both media were supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Internegocios S . A . , Buenos Aires , Argentina ) , 100 U / ml penicillin and 100 µ g / ml streptomycin . Additionally , 1 mM L - glutamine , 10 mM sodium pyruvate , 10 mM HEPES , 10 mM glucose were also supplemented in HCT - 8 cultures . Cells were grown at 37 ◦ C in a humidiﬁed 5 % CO 2 incubator . Cells were subcultured after 80 % conﬂuence was reached ( 7 – 10 days ) in antibiotic - free medium . During experiments , HCT - 8 cells were maintained in growth - arrested conditions ( medium without FBS ) . Cytotoxicity and Neutralization Assay on HCT - 8 Cells Puriﬁed Stx2 and O157 : H7 1 stx2 induced cytotoxicity were assayed on HCT - 8 cells cultured on ﬁxed support . Brieﬂy , HCT - 8 cells monolayers grown on 96 - well plates were treated for 4 h under growth - arrested conditions ( Culture media without FBS ) and antibiotic free conditions with 100 ng / ml Stx2 and / or 4 × 10 8 CFU / ml O157 : H7 1 stx2 . In selected experiments , cells were preincubated with Eliglustat ( 200 nM , 48 h Kaissarian et al . , 2018 ) , Dynasore ( 80 µ M , 30 min ) , M β CD ( 4 mM , 30 min ) , or Amiloride ( 1 mM , 30 min ) and washed twice with PBS before treatment . At the end of the incubation time , plates were washed twice with PBS ( 145 mM NaCl , 10 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 2 ) and subsequently incubated in growth - arrested media for 72 h . Then , cell viability was assayed by neutral red uptake ( Repetto et al . , 2008 ) . Cytotoxic activity neutralization was calculated using the following equation . Cytotoxic Activity Neutralization = 100 ∗ I − T 100 − T ( 1 ) In this Equation , I and T are % cell viability of HCT - 8 cells pre - treated or not with endocytosis inhibitors respectively . Neutral Red Uptake Assay Neutral red uptake assay was performed as previously described , with minor modiﬁcations ( Repetto et al . , 2008 ) . After treatment , cells were washed twice with PBS ( 145 mM NaCl , 10 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 2 ) and incubated for 2 h with freshly diluted neutral red in PBS to a ﬁnal concentration of 50 µ g / ml . Cells were then washed with 1 % CaCl 2 and 4 % formaldehyde twice and were then solubilized in 1 % acetic acid and 50 % ethanol . Absorbance at 546 nm was read in an automated plate spectrophotometer . Results were expressed as percent viability , with 100 % represented by cells incubated under identical conditions but without treatment . The 50 % cytotoxic dose ( CD 50 ) corresponded to the dilution required to kill 50 % of the cells . Cell Monolayer Culture HCT - 8 were seeded on Milicell culture inserts ( PIHP01250 , Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) of 12 mm diameter and 0 . 4 um pore size ( ﬁlter area : 1 . 13 cm ) placed on a 24 - well plate and grown for about 7 – 10 days as previously described until a continuous monolayer was achieved . The development of monolayers was monitored with the electrical resistance ( TEER ) measured with a Millicell - ERS electric resistance system ( Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) until TEER values were stable for 2 consecutive days and higher than 1 , 200 (cid:127) . cm 2 , which is consistent with cell polarization ( Hurley et al . , 1999 ) . Translocation Assays Brieﬂy , after HCT - 8 cell monolayer formation , complete medium was removed from upper ( apical ) and lower ( basolateral ) chambers and replaced with growth - arrested and antibiotic free medium . Apical side of the HCT - 8 cells were exposed to Stx2 ( 100 ng / ml ) in the absence or presence of O157 : H7 1 stx2 ( 4 × 10 8 CFU / ml ) , its ﬁltered supernatant SN - O157 : H7 1 stx2 ( 1 : 10 diluted ) or EDTA ( 10 mM ) as a tight junction disruptor for 4 h at 37 ◦ C in 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Following the incubation period , the media from the lower chamber was ﬁlter - sterilized to determine Stx2 concentration by Vero cell cytotoxic assays . In selected experiments , cells were preincubated with Eliglustat ( 200 nM , 48 h ) , Dynasore ( 80 µ M , 30 min ) , M β CD ( 4 mM , 30 min ) , or Amiloride ( 1 mM , 30 min ) and washed twice with PBS before treatments were applied . Stx2 Quantiﬁcation by Vero Cell Cytotoxicity Assay Vero cells grown in 96 - well culture plate until conﬂuence were treated in serum - free medium for 24 h with diﬀerent concentrations of puriﬁed Stx2 or diﬀerent dilutions of experimental samples . At the end of the incubation , cell viability Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 3 November 2019 | Volume 9 | Article 396 Garimano et al . STEC Infection Modulates Stx2 Action was analyzed by neutral red uptake . Stx2 concentrations were calculated from Stx2 standard curves . When the cytotoxic eﬀect elicited by ﬁlter - sterilized SN from O157 : H7 grown to exponential phase was compared to a puriﬁed Stx2 curve used as standard , the average cytotoxicity of the ﬁltered SN was equivalent to 100 ± 6 ng / ml Stx2 ( data not shown ) . Paracellular Permeability Paracellular permeability in HCT - 8 monolayers was determined by measuring FITC - Dextran passage from the apical - to basolateral side of monolayers , taking into account that Dextran ( MW 70 kDa ) cannot penetrate the cellular membrane under physiological conditions being its molecular weight similar to Stx2 ( Hashida et al . , 1986 ; Balda et al . , 1996 ; Matter and Balda , 2003 ) . FITC - Dextran was measured according to methods described previously with some modiﬁcations ( Balda et al . , 1996 ) . FITC - Dextran ( 1 mg / ml ) was added on the upper ( apical ) chamber at the beginning of each experiment . Following the incubation period , 100 µ l of media from the upper ( apical ) and lower ( basolateral ) chamber collected separately were placed in a 96 - well plate and the concentration of FITC - Dextran was measured on a ﬂuorescence multiplate reader ( FLUOstar Omega , excitation , 486 nm ; emission , 520 nm ) . Relative ﬂuorescence was then calculated as a ratio between lower ( basolateral ) chamber ﬂuorescence and total ﬂuorescence . Sample readings were performed in triplicate . Adhesion of O157 : H7 1 stx2 to HCT - 8 Cells HCT - 8 cells were grown on 24 - wells plates until a conﬂuent monolayer was achieved . Monolayers were pretreated with Eliglustat ( 200 nM , 48 h ) , Dynasore ( 80 µ M , 30 min ) , M β CD ( 4 mM , 30 min ) , or Amiloride ( 1 mM , 30 min ) , washed twice with PBS and then treated for 4 h with 4 × 10 8 CFU / ml O157 : H7 1 stx2 in the presence of 100 ng / ml Stx2 . To count CFU number , cells were washed 5 times with PBS to remove non - attached bacteria and lysed using 0 . 2 % Triton - PBS solution for 30 min . Serial dilutions of these suspensions were spread on LB - agar coated Petri dishes and incubated at 37 ◦ C for 24 h for optical counting . Stx2 Flow Cytometry Detection The presence of intracellular and extracellular Stx2 in HCT - 8 cells pre - incubated with endocytic inhibitors was evaluated in HCT - 8 cells by ﬂow cytometry . For that purpose , cells were ﬁxed after treatment in 0 . 5 % paraformaldehyde , and for intracellular staining , permeabilized with saponin 0 . 1 % in phosphate - buﬀered saline ( PBS ) . Then , cells were incubated in PBS 0 . 5 % FBS with Mab 2E11 for 2 h , followed by a 1 h incubation with an Alexa 647 - conjugated anti - mouse secondary antibody for 1 h . Cells were subsequently washed and resuspended in PBS . The staining was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry on PARTEC PAS III using Cyﬂogic software 1 . 2 . 1 . Results are expressed as percentage of Stx2 positive events and median intensity of ﬂuorescence ( MIF ) in cells treated compared to cells not pre - treated with inhibitors . Statistical Analysis Cytotoxicity curves were ﬁtted using linear or logarithmic regression . Statistical signiﬁcance for all assays was assessed FIGURE 1 | Stx2 and O157 : H7 1 stx2 cytotoxicity on HCT - 8 cells . HCT - 8 cells were incubated with either 100ng / ml Stx2 alone or in the presence of 4 x 10 8 CFU / ml O157 : H7 1 stx2 ( O157 : H7 1 stx2 + Stx2 ) for 4h and compared with 4 × 10 8 O157 : H7 1 stx2 alone .

Analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism v6 . 01 software . Statistical signiﬁcance was set at ∗ p < 0 . 05 . RESULTS Effects of O157 : H7 1 stx2 Infection on Stx2 Cytotoxicity To examine if Stx2 cytotoxicity could be modulated by O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection , cell viability was measured on HCT - 8 cells incubated with either 100 ng / ml Stx2 alone or in presence of 4 × 10 8 CFU / ml O157 : H7 1 stx2 ( O157 : H7 1 stx2 + Stx2 ) and compared with HCT - 8 cells incubated with O157 : H7 1 stx2 alone . As shown in Figure 1 , the cytotoxic eﬀect caused by O157 : H7 1 stx2 + Stx2 was signiﬁcantly greater compared to Stx2 alone , while O157 : H7 1 stx2 did not show any cytotoxic eﬀect . These results suggest that an increase in Stx2 cytotoxicity is elicited by O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection . Effect of Endocytic - Pathway Inhibitors on Stx2 Uptake and Cytotoxic Effects The ﬁnding that O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection signiﬁcantly increased Stx2 cytotoxicity in HCT - 8 cells led the studies to determine which pathways are involved in Stx2 uptake and cytotoxicity and , in turn , which ones were stimulated by O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection . HCT - 8 cells were pre - treated with Eliglustat ( 200 nM , 48 h ) , an inhibitor of glucosylceramide ( GL1 ) synthase ( Shayman , 2013 ) , M β CD ( 4 mM , 30 min ) , a membrane cholesterol extractor Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 4 November 2019 | Volume 9 | Article 396 Garimano et al .

FIGURE 3 | Effect of endocytosis inhibitors on Stx2 cytotoxicity in HCT - 8 cells . Cells were pre - incubated with Eliglustat ( 200nM , 48h ) , M β CD ( 4mM , 30min ) , Dynasore ( 80 µ M , 30min ) , or Amiloride ( 1mM , 30min ) and washed twice with PBS before treatment for 4h of 100ng / ml Stx2 with or without O157 : H7 1 stx2 . Data is shown as means ± SEM from six independent experiments performed in triplicate . Signiﬁcant differences were found between the groups , labeled a , b , c , and d . ( Zidovetzki and Levitan , 2007 ) , Dynasore ( 80 µ M , 30 min ) , a speciﬁc dynamin - mediated endocytic inhibitor ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) or Amiloride ( 1 mM , 30 min ) , a speciﬁc dynamin - mediated endocytic inhibitor ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) . Cells were then incubated with 100 ng / ml Stx2 during 4 h . Finally , toxin uptake was measured by ﬂow cytometry . As it can be seen on Figure 2 , both % MIF and % Stx2 positive events were signiﬁcantly lower when cells were pre - incubated with Eliglustat or M β CD , compared to Dynasore or Amiloride , indicating that Stx2 uptake may be sensitive to glucosylceramide synthase inhibition ( presumably due to Gb3 synthesis inhibition ) and / or cholesterol dependent but not signiﬁcantly dynamin or macropinocytosis dependent . In agreement with the reduced level of Stx2 uptake observed following inhibitor treatments , Stx2 cytotoxicity was also decreased by the inhibitors Eliglustat and M β CD ( Figure 3 ) , with Eliglustat having a more pronounced eﬀect . Notably , the neutralizing eﬀect on cytotoxicity by Eliglustat was maximal when O157 : H7 1 stx2 were not present and appeared lower when O157 : H7 1 stx2 were present , though no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found . On the other hand , Amiloride and Dynasore showed a signiﬁcantly lower protective capability than Eliglustat and M β CD , but both showed a signiﬁcantly higher neutralizing capability when cells were treated with O157 : H7 1 stx2 + Stx2 compared to Stx2 alone ( Figure 3 ) . None of these inhibitors showed cytotoxic activity per se when they were tested alone ( data not shown ) . This data is consistent with a necessary interaction between Stx2 and the Gb3 receptor , presented in the apical surface of HCT - 8 cells , to cause cytotoxicity , although these eﬀects appear to be less dependent on the lipid environment compared to the net Stx2 uptake measured by ﬂow cytometry . However , dynamin - dependent and Gb3 - independent macropinocytic endocytosis pathways became relevant only when O157 : H7 1 stx2 were present , suggesting that these mechanisms are sensitive to O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection . None of the inhibitors used for pre - incubation showed a signiﬁcant eﬀect on O157 : H7 1 stx2 adhesion to HCT - 8 cells ( Figure S1 ) . Effect of O157 : H7 Infection on Stx2 Translocation To determine whether Stx2 translocation across the intestinal barrier was aﬀected by the presence of O157 : H7 1 stx2 , HCT - 8 monolayers were incubated with 100 ng / ml of Stx2 alone or in the presence of : 4 x 10 8 CFU / ml O157 : H7 1 stx2 , 10 mM EDTA , or O157 : H7 1 stx2 supernatant from O157 : H7 1 stx2 ( SN O157 : H7 1 stx2 ) , added on the upper ( apical ) chamber . After 4 h of incubation , Stx2 passage was quantiﬁed on the lower ( basolateral ) chamber by Vero cell cytotoxicity assay ( Figure 4A ) . Since Stx has been shown to be able to cross polarized epithelial cells through both transcellular and paracellular pathways ( Hurley et al . , 2001 ; Malyukova et al . , 2009 ; Lukyanenko et al . , 2011 ; Tran et al . , 2018 ) , FITC - Dextran passage from apical to basolateral side was simultaneously Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 5 November 2019 | Volume 9 | Article 396 Garimano et al . STEC Infection Modulates Stx2 Action FIGURE 4 | Stx2 translocation across HCT - 8 monolayers . ( A ) Stx2 concentration in the lower ( basolateral ) chamber was determined by Vero cell cytotoxicity assays . ( B ) Relative FITC - Dextran passage ( % ) to the lower ( basolateral ) chamber was measured . Signiﬁcant differences were found between the groups , labeled a , b , c , and d . measured ( Figure 4B ) . Maximum Stx2 translocation across the HCT - 8 monolayers was found in the presence of O157 : H7 1 stx2 compared to the other experimental conditions ( Figure 4A ) . Instead , maximum FITC - Dextran passage was found in the presence of EDTA , a potent tight junction disruptor agent , followed by O157 : H7 1 stx2 treatment ( Figure 4B ) . Taken together , these results have demonstrated that O157 : H7 1 stx2 stimulates not only paracellular , but also transcellular Stx2 translocation . On the other hand , monolayers exposed to SN O157 : H7 1 stx2 also resulted in a signiﬁcant increase of Stx2 and FITC - Dextran passage ( Figures 4A , B , respectively ) indicating that O157 : H7 1 stx2 SN aﬀected at least the paracellular permeability but to a lesser extent than that observed with O157 : H7 1 stx2 ( Figure 4B b vs . c ) , compared to treatment with Stx2 alone ( Figure 4B d ) . To conﬁrm the eﬀects of O157 : H7 1 stx2 and its ﬁltered SN on epithelial barrier function leading to Stx2 paracellular translocation , we analyzed the integrity of the tight junctional barrier by TEER measurements before and after each treatment ( Figure 5 ) . The integrity of tight junctions clearly declined in monolayers treated with O157 : H7 1 stx2 and SN O157 : H7 1 stx2 in the presence of Stx2 , proportionally to the increase of FITC - Dextran passage . As it was expected , minimum TEER value was observed after incubation with 10 mM EDTA . However , the Stx2 passage was higher in the presence of O157 : H7 1 stx2 than with EDTA , supporting the hypothesis that O157 : H7 1 stx2 stimulates Stx2 translocation across transcellular and paracellular pathways . Effects of Endocytosis Inhibitors on Stx2 Passage Across the Transcellular Pathway To assess which endocytic mechanisms previously described are involved in Stx2 transcytosis in presence of O157 : H7 1 stx2 , HCT - 8 cells monolayers were pre - incubated with Eliglustat , Dynasore , M β CD , or Amiloride as previously described , FIGURE 5 | Stx2 translocation was not entirely correlated to tight junction barrier disruption . The correlation between Stx2 translocation and the disruptive effects on tight junctional barrier measured as TEER and FITC - Dextran passage was analyzed in HCT - 8 cell monolayers after 4h incubation with O157 : H7 1 stx2 , SN O157 : H7 1 stx2 and EDTA . Stx2 concentration was determined in the lower ( basolateral ) chamber by Vero cell cytotoxicity assays and it was relativized to initial Stx2 concentration ( 100ng / ml ) . Relative FITC - Dextran passage was calculated as a ratio between lower ( basolateral ) chamber ﬂuorescence and total ﬂuorescence relative to cell free control . TEER was measured at the end of treatments and expressed as a percentage of the corresponding TEER immediately before the start of treatments . followed by incubation with O157 : H7 1 stx2 + Stx2 . Stx2 translocation , measured as indicated above , was signiﬁcantly inhibited by all treatments , with a maximum inhibition observed after M β CD treatment , followed by Eliglustat , and Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 6 November 2019 | Volume 9 | Article 396 Garimano et al . STEC Infection Modulates Stx2 Action lastly , Dynasore and Amiloride ( Figure 6A ) . In addition , none of these inhibitors signiﬁcantly disrupted the epithelial barrier function measured as FITC - Dextran translocation ( Figure 6B ) . These results suggest that cholesterol disruption was more eﬃcient than glucosylceramide synthesis inhibition at decreasing endocytosis - dependent translocation , suggesting a wider implication of cholesterol in the transcytosis process . In addition , Stx2 translocation via dynamin and macropinocytic pathways was also signiﬁcantly decreased , showing that both mechanisms also may play a role on Stx2 transcytosis during O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection . DISCUSSION We have previously reported that Stx2 - mediated physiological and morphological alterations to human colonic mucosa was enhanced by exposure to O157 : H7 bacteria ( Albanese et al . , 2015 ) . In the present study , we demonstrate that infection of human colonic epithelial ( HCT - 8 ) monolayers by O157 : H7 1 stx2 also impacts Stx2 endocytosis , cytotoxic action , and translocation across intestinal epithelial monolayers . In this report , HCT - 8 cells infected with O157 : H7 1 stx2 supplemented with Stx2 exhibited a signiﬁcantly higher cytotoxic activity compared to the same concentration of Stx2 alone , indicating that O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection led to host cell modiﬁcations that enhanced Stx2 cytotoxicity ( Figure 1 ) . Regarding Stx2 eﬀects on uninfected cells , we have seen that inhibition of glucosylceramide synthesis by Eliglustat led to a maximum decrease in Stx2 entry into cells and cytotoxic eﬀects on HCT - 8 cells ( Figures 2 , 3 ) . This inhibitor has been used at optimal concentration and incubation time according to previous works with endothelial cells ( Kaissarian et al . , 2018 ) and to previous experience with another glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor ( Miglustat , Acetilon Pharm ) ( Girard et al . , 2015 ) that also reduces Gb3 synthesis . It is worth noting that Eliglustat inhibits the synthesis of multiple glucosylceramides besides Gb3 , some of which have been implied in membrane traﬃc and endocytic pathway modulation ( Sillence et al . , 2002 ) . In this direction , it is possible that the absence of these glucosylceramides may account for some of the eﬀects observed , but we speculate that their relative relevance on Stx2 uptake and cytotoxic activity should be minor compared to Gb3 absence . Our results indicate that , although Eliglustat prevented Stx2 cytotoxic eﬀects ( Figure 3 ) , it did not completely inhibit net Stx2 internalization ( Figure 2 ) . We propose that this observed Stx2 uptake may be due to Gb3 - independent endocytic mechanisms ( Chan and Ng , 2016 ) , although it may not have been enough to exert Stx2 cytotoxic eﬀects . Similarly , removal of cholesterol by using M β CD reduced Stx2 uptake and cytotoxicity , although it appeared to do so to a lesser extent than that observed with Eliglustat . Cholesterol is known to be a major component of the microenvironment in which Gb3 is embedded , and it has previously been implicated on Gb3 avidity for Stx2 ( Gallegos et al . , 2012 ) and Stx2 - induced tubule scission ( Gaus et al . , 2010 ) . It was also suggested that cholesterol may play a role on macropinocytosis and membrane ruﬄing ( Grimmer et al . , 2002 ) . Although signiﬁcant diﬀerences were not found , Eliglustat appeared to be less eﬀective on decreasing Stx2 cytotoxicity when O157 : H7 1 stx2 was present , compared to the bacterial - free condition ( Figure 3 ) . Even though the methods used may have not been sensitive enough to provide signiﬁcant diﬀerences in this scenario , we speculate that this result is relevant as it may account for the signiﬁcant stimulation observed of alternative mechanisms , such as macropinocytosis and dynamin - dependent pathways , upon O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection . On the other hand , dynamin’s role on Stx2 induced tubule scission after Gb3 binding is highly controversial , as a putative spontaneous , actin - dependent mechanism has also been described ( Gaus et al . , 2010 ) . In this study , we found that dynamin - dependent Stx2 endocytosis had no relevance on Stx2 uptake ( Figure 2 ) or cytotoxic eﬀects when O157 : H7 1 stx2 was absent but did signiﬁcantly contribute to Stx2 cytotoxicity upon O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection ( Figure 3 ) . We speculate that these diﬀerences may be explained as it was observed that O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection could exert a positive action on dynamin recruitment around vesicles , which is required for actin pedestal formation ( Unsworth et al . , 2007 ) . Alternatively , we hypothesize that actin rearrangement induced by O157 : H7 1 stx2 may have aﬀected actin - dependent vesicle scission mechanisms ( Gaus et al . , 2010 ) , which may in turn increase dynamin dependent scission , although the exact underlying causes remain a subject for future studies . Macropinocytosis involvement in Stx2 internalization during STEC infection and the molecular mechanisms implicated has been previously described ( Malyukova et al . , 2009 ; Lukyanenko et al . , 2011 ; In et al . , 2013 ) . In this study , we found that macropinocytosis signiﬁcantly contributed to Stx2 internalization only when O157 : H7 1 stx2 were present , indicating that bacterial infection exerts a positive eﬀect on cell’s macropinocytosis regulation ( Figure 3 ) . As O157 : H7 is generally believed to be non - invasive , Stx2 must translocate across the epithelial barrier of the intestine in order to reach target organs and cause HUS ( Boyce et al . , 2002 ) . In this study , we demonstrate that Stx2 passage across polarized HCT - 8 monolayers is enhanced by O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection . This increase is not exclusively due to soluble metabolites , as SN O157 : H7 1 stx2 exerted a much lesser , although statistically signiﬁcant , eﬀect on transcytosis ( Figure 4A ) . Previous studies have shown that Stx2 may translocate the intestinal barrier by a paracellular in addition to a transcellular / endocytic pathway ( Hurley et al . , 2001 ; Müller et al . , 2017 ) . We used EDTA , a chelating agent extensively described as a tight junction disruptor ( Ward et al . , 2000 ) , to estimate the maximum passage allowed by the paracellular route . We conﬁrmed by TEER and FITC - Dextran measurements that paracellular passage and permeability were maximum when EDTA was added , followed by O157 : H7 1 stx2 treatment ( Figures 4B , 5 ) . However , Stx2 translocation in presence of O157 : H7 1 stx2 was signiﬁcantly higher than with EDTA treatment ( Figure 5 ) , suggesting that both paracellular and transcellular translocation routes can be Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 7 November 2019 | Volume 9 | Article 396 Garimano et al . STEC Infection Modulates Stx2 Action FIGURE 6 | Stx2 translocation in presence of endocytosis inhibitors . Cells were pre - incubated with Eliglustat ( 200nM , 48h ) , MBCD ( 4mM , 30min ) , Dynasore ( 80 µ M , 30min ) , or Amiloride ( 1mM , 30min ) , and washed twice with PBS followed by treatment with O157 : H7 1 stx2 + 100ng / ml Stx2 for 4h . Control cells were not pre - treated with inhibitors . ( A ) Estimated Stx2 concentration in the lower ( basolateral ) chamber . ( B ) Relative FITC - Dextran passage ( % ) to the lower ( basolateral ) chamber . Signiﬁcant differences were found between groups with different letters , labeled a , b , and c . upregulated by O157 : H7 1 stx2 . Again , SN O157 : H7 1 stx2 was able to exert a signiﬁcant eﬀect over tight junction integrity compared to Stx2 alone , but much less than that exerted by O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection . Previous reports showed that Stx2 translocation across a polarized colonic epithelial T84 cell line is enhanced by O157 : H7 infection and may only occur via a transcellular pathway because TEER remains constant during infection with several STEC O157 : H7 strains ( Tran et al . , 2014 , 2018 ) . In the same fashion , we found that the transcellular pathway is stimulated by O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection , but we also observed that the paracellular pathway , measured as TEER and FITC - Dextran permeability , was signiﬁcantly aﬀected after infection with O157 : H7 1 stx2 ( Figure 5 ) . The apparent discrepancy could be due to diﬀerences in STEC strains , as the one used in this study belongs to the hypervirulent clade 8 , which was found to overexpress several virulence proteins ( Amigo et al . , 2015 , 2016 ) . Diﬀerences in intestinal cell lines used may also explain these discrepancies , as they show diﬀerences in key characteristics such as monolayers TEER values ( Hurley et al . , 2016 ) , which we speculate may account for diﬀerences in sensitivity of tight junction to O157 : H7 infection . Overall , our data suggests that O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection greatly stimulated Stx2 passage through both paracellular and transcellular pathways , and that this stimulation is mainly due to O157 : H7 1 stx2 co - incubation with epithelial cells , and to a lesser extent , to soluble metabolites released by O157 : H7 1 stx2 to the culture supernatant . We also tested if the same endocytic pathways involved in cytotoxicity could account for the increased transcytosis . Surprisingly , we found that cholesterol depletion by M β CD appears to be more eﬀective decreasing Stx2 transcytosis than glucosylceramide synthesis inhibition by Eliglustat ( Figure 6 ) , though the opposite was observed when cytotoxic eﬀects were analyzed ( Figure 3 ) . Being the exact mechanisms that determine vesicle traﬃcking and its destiny still unknown , we can hypothesize that membrane cholesterol may be more strongly implied on the basolateral traﬃcking leading to translocation , rather than on the retrograde transport leading to cytotoxicity . On the other hand , Amiloride and Dynasore led to a moderate transcytosis decrease ( Figure 6 ) in the same fashion as that observed in cytotoxic neutralization ( Figure 3 ) , suggesting that O157 : H7 1 stx2 could also stimulate macropinocytosis and dynamin - dependent translocation . As these endocytosis inhibitors showed similar eﬀects on both cytotoxicity and transcytosis , we can hypothesize that , to a degree , the mechanisms leading to both outcomes may have the same endocytic origin ( Malyukova et al . , 2009 ; Müller et al . , 2017 ) . To summarize , our results showed that E . coli O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection increases Stx2 cytotoxic eﬀect by stimulation of several endocytic pathways . Furthermore , we demonstrated that O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection enhances Stx2 translocation across HCT - 8 monolayers in both paracellular and transcellular pathways . We showed that dynamin - independent and Gb3 - dependent mechanisms are mostly implicated in Stx2 endocytosis and translocation , though dynamin dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis became more relevant when O157 : H7 1 stx2 infection was present . This study provides insight on how O157 : H7 infection may promote Stx2 associated disease by aﬀecting Stx2 intestinal toxicity , uptake , and / or translocation into the systemic circulation resulting in intoxication of distal target organs . These studies may open the door to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for treating EHEC associated disease .
