Transcriptional activation of many TLR - responsive genes requires an initial de - repression step in which NCoR co - repressor complexes are actively removed from target gene promoters to relieve basal repression 3 , 4 . Ligand - dependent SUMOylation of liver X receptors ( LXRs ) potently suppresses TLR4 - induced transcription by preventing the NCoR clearance step 5 – 7 , but the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic . Here , we provide evidence that Coronin 2A ( Coro2A ) , a component of the NCoR complex of previously unknown function 8 , 9 , mediates TLR - induced NCoR turnover by a mechanism involving interaction with oligomeric nuclear actin . SUMOylated LXRs block NCoR turnover by binding to a conserved SUMO2 / 3 interaction motif in Coro2A and Users may view , print , copy , download and text and data - mine the content in such documents , for the purposes of academic research , subject always to the full Conditions of use : http : / / www . nature . com / authors / editorial _ policies / license . html # terms 6 Correspondence : ckg @ ucsd . edu . 7Present address : Department of Experimental Oncology , European Institute of Oncology , Via Adamello , 16 , 20139 Milano , Italy .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t preventing actin recruitment . Intriguingly , the LXR transrepression pathway can itself be inactivated by inflammatory signals that induce CaMKII γ - dependent phosphorylation of LXR , leading to its deSUMOylation by the SUMO protease SENP3 and release from Coro2A . These findings reveal a Coro2A / actin - dependent mechanism for de - repression of inflammatory response genes that can be differentially regulated by phosphorylation and nuclear receptor signaling pathways that control immunity and homeostasis . To delineate mechanisms by which SUMOylated LXRs block signal - dependent clearance of NCoR complexes from TLR4 - inducible promoters , we searched for potential SUMO interaction motifs ( SIMs ) within proteins associated with the NCoR complex that might mediate interactions with SUMOylated LXRs . This search identified a conserved motif in the carboxyl - terminus of Coro2A ( Fig . 1a ) , that matches a recently identified SIM that is specific for SUMO2 / 3 10 . Coro2A is a member of the Coronin family of actin binding proteins that was identified as a component of the NCoR complex in nuclear extracts of HeLa cells 8 , 9 and is highly expressed in cells of the hematopoietic lineage 11 , 12 . All other members of the Coronin family have thus far been found to play roles in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with F - actin 13 , 14 , but functional roles of Coro2A in the NCoR complex have not been established . We confirmed Coro2A / NCoR interactions in primary macrophages by co - immunoprecipitation ( Co - IP ) assay and found that In contrast to other Coronin family members , Coro2A is primarily localized to the nucleus in primary bone marrow - derived macrophages ( BMDMs ) ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . In addition , immunofluoresence microscopy demonstrated that Coro2A co - localizes to NCoR - rich regions of the nucleus ( Fig . 1b ) . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) studies further demonstrated that Coro2A is localized to NCoR target promoters such as the Nos2 and Ccl2 promoters in resting macrophages and its occupancy was reduced by treatment with the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( Fig . 1c ) . Sequential ChIP experiments indicated that Coro2A and NCoR reside together on the Nos2 promoter ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . Reduction of NCoR expression in primary macrophages using specific siRNAs resulted in a corresponding reduction in Coro2A occupancy on the Nos2 and Ccl2 promoters without affecting total Coro2A protein expression ( Supplementary 2d , e ) . In contrast , Coro2A was not found on the Csf3 promoter ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) , which is not a target of NCoR repressison 15 . To investigate the potential role of Coro2A as a molecular beacon for SUMOylated LXRs , co - immunoprecipitation ( Co - IP ) studies were performed in which HeLa cells were transfected with Flag - tagged wild type LXR β or a mutant of LXR β ( K410 / 448R ) that cannot be SUMOylated 5 and treated with the synthetic LXR agonist GW3965 ( GW ) . The mutant form of LXR β did not co - precipitate with Coro2A , whereas wild type LXR β was co - precipitated with Coro2A and migrated at the expected molecular weight for SUMO - LXR β ( Fig . 1d ) . This interaction was largely dependent on treatment with GW3965 ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . In addition , in vitro transcribed and translated Coro2A preferentially interacted with recombinant GST - LXR β conjugated to SUMO3 in vitro , as compared to unconjugated GST - LXR β or de - SUMOylated LXR β ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . Next , ChIP experiments were performed in primary macrophages following transfection with control or Coro2A - specific siRNAs . Knockdown of Coro2A expression resulted in an Huang et al .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t almost complete loss of recruitment of LXR to the Nos2 and C cl2 promoters in response to GW3965 ( Fig . 1e ) . Although a recent study reported that GPS2 was required for recruitment of SUMOylated LXR β to the Crp and Hp promoters in liver 7 , GPS2 is not present above IgG background on the Nos2 or Il1b promoters as determined by ChIP assay , and GPS2 knockdown had no impact on LXR transrepression of Nos2 or Il1b in primary macrophages ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . Point mutations were therefore introduced into the SIM of Coro2A to evaluate its potential importance in recruiting SUMO - LXRs . HeLa cells were transfected with Flag - tagged wild type or SIM mutant versions of Coro2A and treated with vehicle or GW3965 . Both WT and SIM mutant Coro2A were immunoprecipitated by anti - NCoR antibody , but only WT Coro2A interacted with LXR , and this interaction was enhanced by treatment with GW3965 ( Fig 1f ) . In addition , a mammalian two - hybrid assay indicated that LXR interacts with Coro2A in a ligand - and SIM motif - dependent manner ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . When over - expressed in RAW264 . 7 macrophages , this Coro2A SIM mutant occupies the NCoR - residing Nos2 promoter ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . However , ligand - mediated recruitment of LXR and its repression function was significantly reduced by overexpression of this mutant , consistent with a dominant - negative function ( Fig . 1g and Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . In contrast , dexamethasone repression mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor , via an NCoR and SUMOylation independent mechanism 16 , remained unaffected ( Fig 1g ) . Unexpectedly , knockdown of Coro2A expression resulted in impaired responsiveness of a subset of TLR inducible NCoR target genes , including Nos2 , Il10 , Il1b and Ccl2 , but not of non - NCoR - regulated promoters , such as irf1 ( Fig . 2a ) . ChIP experiments further revealed that knockdown of Coro2A resulted in a failure of LPS to promote clearance of NCoR from the Nos2 and Il1b promoter ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . As there is increasing evidence for diverse transcriptional roles of oligomeric nuclear actin 17 , we considered the possible role of nuclear actin in NCoR clearance . We confirmed that Coro2A interacts with actin and using conserved sequence features required for the interaction of murine Coronin1 with actin 14 , 18 , 19 , introduced point mutations in Coro2A ( K11A / R13A ) that severely compromised actin binding ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . Overexpression of either an N - terminal deletion mutant of Coro2A lacking the actin - binding domain ( ΔN ) , or the Coro2A K11A / R13A mutant blocked LPS - induced NCoR clearance and impaired activation of the Nos2 promoter in RAW264 . 7 macrophages ( Fig . 2c , d ) . ChIP assays using an antibody ( 2G2 ) that specifically recognizes nuclear actin 20 revealed transient recruitment of actin to the Nos2 ( Fig . 2e ) and Il1b ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) promoters coincident with the timing of LPS - induced NCoR clearance . Actin was not recruited to the TLR4 - inducible , NCoR - independent Csf3 promoter or the Abca1 promoter , which is a positive transcriptional target of LXRs that is occupied by NCoR in the absence of LXR agonists 4 , 21 ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . Actin recruitment was dependent on both NCoR and phosphorylation of cJun , as it was abolished in primary macrophages by NCoR knockdown and in RAW264 . 7 macrophages by overexpression of a mutant form of c - Jun that cannot be phosphorylated ( Supplementary Fig . 5d - e ) . LPS - induced actin recruitment to the Nos2 promoter in macrophages was also abolished by siRNA - mediated knockdown of Coro2A ( Fig . 2e ) . Short - term treatment of primary macrophages with latrunculin A , which inhibits actin polymerization 22 , similarly blocked LPS dependent NCoR clearance and induction of Nos2 mRNA ( Supplementary Fig . Huang et al . Page 3 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2012 October 05 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t 6a , b ) . In contrast , latrunculin A did not affect TLR4 activation of the NCoR - independent Irf1 gene , LXR activation of the Abca1 gene ( Supplementary Fig . 6c - e ) or TLR4 - dependent phosphorylation of cJun ( Supplementary Fig . 6f , g ) . Notably , treatment of primary macrophages with the LXR ligand , GW3965 , blocked LPS - induced actin recruitment ( Fig . 2f ) , but not cJun phosphorylation ( Supplementary Fig . 6h ) , suggesting that SUMOylated LXRs may exert anti - inflammatory effects by blocking the actin - dependent step required for NCoR clearance . LXRs are unable to suppress transcriptional responses of NCoR target genes to pro - inflammatory signals that induce CaMKII activation , including the TLR1 / 2 agonist Pam3CSK4 21 , the TLR2 / 6 agonist FSL - 1 , and Salmonella typhimurium 23 ( Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) . Co - IP studies in RAW264 . 7 macrophages revealed that Pam3CSK ( Pam3 ) signaling significantly reduced interaction of SUMO - LXR β with Coro2A in a CaMKII γ - dependent manner ( Fig . 3a ) . Because interaction of LXR with Coro2A requires SUMOylation , we considered the possible involvement of deSUMOylating enzymes in negatively regulating LXR repression functions . Using siRNAs to knock down SUMO proteases expressed in primary macrophages , we found that knockdown of SENP3 restored the ability of LXRs to suppress TLR1 / 2 - dependent Nos2 expression ( Fig . 3b ) , interact with the Nos2 promoter , and prevent NCoR clearance ( Fig . 3c ) . ChIP experiments further demonstrated that SENP3 was rapidly recruited to the Nos2 , but not the Csf3 , promoter following Pam3 stimulation , and this recruitment was dependent on CaMKII γ ( Fig . 3d ) . Knockdown of CaMKII γ also restored LXR transrepression of Il1b and BIC ( precursor of miR - 155 ) as well as abolished SENP3 recruitment to these gene promoters ( Supplementary Fig . 7c – f ) . Co - immunoprecipitation experiments suggested a sequence in which Pam3 induced CaMKII - LXR interaction , followed shortly thereafter by SENP3 - LXR interaction ( Supplementary Fig . 8a ) . As both LXR α and LXR β contain a conserved motif that conforms to a CaMKII phosphorylation site ( S427 in LXR β , Fig . 3e ) , we considered the possibility that LXRs were themselves the targets of CaMKII γ kinase activity and that phosphorylation of LXR might promote its interaction with SENP3 . Consistent with this possibility , TLR1 / 2 activation was found to result in robust serine phosphorylation of LXR β in a CaMKII γ - dependent manner ( Fig . 3e ) . WT - Flag - tagged LXR β was a substrate for recombinant CaMKII γ in vitro , but Flag - tagged LXR β with a serine to alanine point mutation at the 427 residue was not ( Fig . 3f and Supplementary Fig . 8b ) . In addition , the phospho - null mutant of LXR continued to associate with Coro2A - NCoR bound Nos2 promoter and retained transrepression activities upon TLR1 / 2 signaling ( Fig . 3g and Supplementary Fig . 8c ) , recapitulating the effect of knocking down CaMKII γ 21 and suggesting that LXR S427 is likely the major or only substrate of CaMKII relevant to inactivation of the LXR transrepression pathway . In contrast , a phospho - mimic mutant of LXR ( S427D ) was not able to interact with Coro2A to promote transrepression of the Nos2 luciferase reporter in RAW64 . 7 macrophages ( Supplementary Fig . 8d , e ) . To investigate whether CaMKII phosphorylation of LXR β created a docking site for SENP3 , RAW264 . 7 macrophages were transfected with expression vectors for HA - LXR β , Flag - SENP , and control or CaMKII γ - specific siRNAs and treated with GW3965 in the absence or Huang et al .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t presence of Pam3 . Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that TLR1 / TLR2 activation induced rapid interaction of SENP3 with LXR β that was dependent on CaMKII γ ( Fig . 3h ) . This interaction was not observed with the LXR β S427A mutant ( Fig . 3i ) . We next used a thioglycollate - induced sterile peritonitis model 24 to investigate potential roles of the Coro2A - NCoR clearance pathway in vivo . Injection of thioglycollate into the peritoneal cavity leads to massive infiltration of activated macrophages , which by three days following injection account for more than 90 % of the total peritoneal cavity cell population . In vivo knockdown of Coro2A expression in this macrophage population using two independent methods significantly reduced expression of Ccl2 , Il1b , and Cxcl10 , but not Abca1 ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Fig . 9a ) and resulted in significantly increased NCoR occupancy ( Fig . 4b ) . The presence of phosphorylated ( active ) CaMKII in the elicited macrophage population ( Supplementary Fig . 9b ) , suggested that an endogenous LXR repression pathway in these cells might be inactivated . Consistent with this possibility , CoIP studies demonstrated that LXR α / β were not associated with Coro2A in elicited macrophages in control animals , but became associated with Coro2A in animals that were treated with the CaMKII inhibitor , KN93 , ( Supplementary Fig . 9b ) . In addition , KN93 treatment increased NCoR occupancy on the Ccl2 , Cxcl10 and Il1b promoters in macrophages in WT mice , but not in LXR α / β double knockout mice ( Fig . 4c ) . Finally , KN93 treatment reduced the expression of Ccl2 , Cxcl10 and Il1 β in wild type mice , but not in LXR double knockout mice ( Fig . 4d ) , suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII ‘rescues’ endogenous LXR transrepression activity in this inflammatory context . Collectively , these findings provide evidence that Coro2A functions as an NCoR exchange factor that is required for de - repression of TLR target genes in the macrophage ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Recent findings providing evidence for roles of nuclear actin in movements of specific chromosomal loci to transcriptional ‘hubs’ 25 , 26 raise a number of interesting possibilities with respect to dynamic regulation of the localization of repression machinery . The ability of other Coronins to mediate disassembly of actin polymers in the cytoplasm 14 , 27 suggests that Coro2A may function to release inflammatory response genes from localized actin networks dedicated to repression functions . The integrated functions of Coro2A as both a docking site for SUMOylated LXRs and as an actin - dependent NCoR exchange factor suggest a parsimonious transrepression model in which SUMOylated LXRs prevent NCoR turnover and repress responses to LPS by blocking actin recruitment . The ability of CaMKII γ to inactivate the LXR transrepression pathway by creating a docking site for SENP3 further identifies a new transcriptional role for SUMO proteases and reveals an entry point for negative regulation of the LXR repression pathway that could be engaged by numerous other signaling pathways that mobilize intracellular calcium , such as purinergic receptors 21 . It is notable that the SUMO2 / 3 - specific SIM in Coro2A and the CaMKII γ phosphorylation sites in LXRs are highly conserved across vertebrate species , suggesting evolutionary pressure to maintain these regulatory pathways . While such pressures presumably relate to key functions of the innate immune system in responding to infection and injury , signal - induced inactivation of the LXR transrepression pathway may also contribute to pathological forms of inflammation .
