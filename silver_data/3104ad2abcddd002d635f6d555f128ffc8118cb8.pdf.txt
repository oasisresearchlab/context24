However , the functional interplay between cell adhesion turnover and the mi - totic machinery is poorly understood . The endo / exo - cytic trafﬁcking of integrins is regulated by the small GTPase Rab21 , which associates with several integ - rin a subunits . Here , we show that targeted trafﬁck - ing of integrins to and from the cleavage furrow is required for successful cytokinesis , and that this is regulated by Rab21 . Rab21 activity , integrin - Rab21 association , and integrin endocytosis are all neces - sary for normal cytokinesis , which becomes im - paired when integrin - mediated adhesion at the cleavage furrow fails . We also describe a chromo - somal deletion and loss of Rab21 gene expression in human cancer , which leads to the accumulation of multinucleate cells . Importantly , reintroduction of Rab21 rescued this phenotype . In conclusion , Rab21 - regulated integrin trafﬁcking is essential for normal cell division , and its defects may contribute to multinucleation and genomic instability , which are hallmarks of cancer . INTRODUCTION Cytokinesis is the cell - division process at the end of mitosis in which the membrane is physically cleaved and the daughter cells areseparated after chromosome segregation . Althoughamolec - ular outline of the sequential events involving alterations in the microtubule cytoskeleton , the formation of an actomyosin con - tractile ring , and membrane trafﬁcking are known , many aspects of cytokinesis remain poorly characterized ( Glotzer , 2005 ) . Nev - ertheless , understanding cytokinesis is not only important in cell biology , but also in human diseases . A long - standing hypothesis in tumorigenesis is that failures in cell multiplication generate genetically unstable tetraploid cells , which can develop into an - euploid cells with malignant properties ( Boveri , 1914 ; Storchova and Pellman , 2004 ) . It has been demonstrated experimentally that chemically induced tetraploidy ( Fujiwara et al . , 2005 ) or random chromosomal missegregations ( Weaver et al . , 2007 ) leading to aneuploidy can promote tumor development . Dividing adherent cells undergo notable changes in shape that are driven by the actin cytoskeleton and microtubule network . Targeted membrane trafﬁcking is also needed throughout the process ( Albertson et al . , 2005 ; Boucrot and Kirchhausen , 2007 ; Konopka et al . , 2006 ; Matheson et al . , 2005 ; Strickland and Burgess , 2004 ) . These same biological entities also partici - pate in the regulation of integrin - dependent cell migration ( Pellinen and Ivaska , 2006 ; Ridley et al . , 2003 ) . Nonmotile inter - phase cells display large matrix adhesion sites called focal adhe - sions ( Geiger et al . , 2001 ) , which are disassembled during cell migration or upon initiation of mitosis with concomitant changes in cell morphology ( Ezratty et al . , 2005 ; Maddox and Burridge , 2003 ) . Adherent cells held insuspension fail to undergo cytokine - sis , resulting in binucleation ( Ben - Ze’ev and Raz , 1981 ; Kanada et al . , 2005 ; Pugacheva et al . , 2006 ; Thullberg et al . , 2007 ) . In ad - dition , b 1 - integrin expression is required for cytokinesis in chon - drocytes in vivo ( Aszodi et al . , 2003 ) . These ﬁndings suggest that integrin - mediated adhesion may be necessary for successful mitosis . However , the mechanisms involved are not known . Manyintegrinsareconstantlyendocytosedandrecycledtothe plasma membrane ( Pellinen and Ivaska , 2006 ) , facilitating target - ing of these adhesion receptors during cell migration ( Bretscher , 1989 ) . Integrin trafﬁcking requires the spatially regulated activity of a number of kinases in conjuction with Rab - dependent endo - somal compartments ( Caswell and Norman , 2006 ) . The ubiqui - tously expressed , small GTPase Rab21 has recently been shown to associate with the a tails of several integrins via the shared conserved membrane proximal sequence , thus regulating cell adhesionandmigrationviacontrollingtheendo / exocytictrafﬁck - ing of most integrin heterodimers ( Pellinen et al . , 2006 ) . More recently , association between Rab25 and the integrin b 1 subunit has been shown to regulate integrin trafﬁcking and invasion by a mechanism restricted to epithelial cells cultured in three - dimensional matrix ( Caswell et al . , 2007 ) . Whereas the role of integrin trafﬁcking during migration is recognized , almost nothing is known about the role of integrin targeting in cell division . Since errors in cell division can contribute to aneuploidy , which is a critical early step in cancer development ( Piekny et al . , 2005 ) , we have investigated integrin turnover during cell Developmental Cell 15 , 371 – 385 , September 16 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . 371 division in detail . Given the analogy between changes in cell mor - phology during migration and mitosis , we hypothesized that Rab21 could function to support both processes . We demon - strate here that the targeted trafﬁcking of integrins from the cell surface to the cytosolic compartment is necessary for cyto - kinesis in different cell types and organisms . Mechanistically , we show that Rab21 is required for integrin trafﬁcking to the cleav - age furrow of dividing cells . We also demonstrate that human cancer cells can harbor Rab21 deletions , causing impaired cytokinesis and multinucleation . These studies therefore reveal how the coordinated trafﬁcking of integrins is necessary for cell division and link this process to human cancer . RESULTS b 1 - Integrins Anchor the Cleavage Furrow to Matrix in Cytokinesis To gain insight into the function and turnover of integrins during cell division , we investigated the localization of integrins during mitosis ( Figures 1A – 1E ) . In prometaphase and metaphase cells , b 1 - integrin localized diffusely at the membrane and in a few intracellular vesicles ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . In early telophase , in - tegrin was detected mainly on the matrix - facing side of the cells ( Figure 1C , z axis , arrowhead ) , and by mid - telophase , b 1 - integrin concentrated to the ingressing cleavage furrow ( Figure 1D , arrow ) and mainly to the basal side of the furrow , where it possibly anchors the cleavage furrow to the substrate ( Figure 1D , side , arrowhead ) . Strong overlap of b 1 - integrin and actin as well as enrichment of b 1 - integrin at the basal side of Figure 1 . b 1 - Integrins Anchor the Cleavage Furrow to Matrix during Cytokinesis ( A – E ) Nontransfected NCI - H460 lung cancer cells were stained as indicated at different phases of mitosis .

( F ) Representative still images of time - lapse analysis of NCI - H460 cells surface labeled with anti - b 1 function - blocking antibody undergoing cytokinesis . The percentage of cells arrested in cytokinesis ( arrow ) was scored ( mean ± SEM , n = 330 cells per group ; * * * p < 0 . 001 ) . the furrow were detected in 66 % of the cells investigated ( n = 32 ) . In late telophase , the intercellular bridge was no longer connected to the substrate , and b 1 - integrin was concentrated to the extending protrusions formed at the opposite poles of the daughter cells ( Figure 1E , arrow ) . The close proximity of the cleavage furrow to the underlying matrix suggested that integrin - mediated adhesion or integrin signaling may play a functional role in cytokinesis . To investigate this , we analyzed cytokinesis in live cells treated with function - blocking b 1 - integrin antibody ( Wayner et al . , 1993 ) . The integ - rin - antibody complex was internalized and moved to the furrow ( data not shown ) . However , the inability of the accumulated integrins to adhere to matrix resulted in an increased number of cells arrested in cytokinesis compared to control cells ( Figure 1F , arrows ; Movie S1 available online ) . This suggests that integrins accumulating to the cleavage furrow function either to anchor the structure or to trigger matrix - induced signaling and thus support the execution of cytokinesis . Perturbation of the Rab21 GTPase Cycle Blocks Cytokinesis We have shown earlier that Rab21 small GTPase associates with integrin cargo and targets them to the endocytic machinery in migrating cells ( Pellinen et al . , 2006 ) . Since integrin trafﬁcking could also regulate cell division , we examined whether perturba - tion of Rab21 activity affects cell division . Rab21 function can be inhibited by the expression of mutant Rab21 locked in the GTP form ( Pellinen et al . , 2006 ) . Expression of GTP - locked Rab21 inhibits integrin trafﬁcking without affecting the trafﬁcking of the transferrin receptor ( Pellinen et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly , Rab21GTP induced a bi - or multinucleate phenotype in different cell types derived from various species , including human lung cancer cells ( NCI - H460 ) , mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) , and Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells ( Figure 2A ; Developmental Cell Integrin Trafﬁcking Regulates Cytokinesis 372 Developmental Cell 15 , 371 – 385 , September 16 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . Figures S1A and S4A ) . A total of 16 hr after transfection , 69 % ± 5 % of GFP - Rab21GTP - expressing NCI - H460 cells were bi - or multinucleate , compared to 11 % ± 3 % of nontransfected cells ( Figure 2B ) . Treatment of Rab21GTP - expressing cells with the microtubule - depolymerizing drug nocodazole led to pseudo metaphase arrest , indicating that mitotic checkpoint signaling was not compromised in these cells ( Figure 2B ; Figure S1A ) . To investigate whether the observed bi - and multinucleation was due to defects in cytokinesis , we examined Rab21GTP - expressing cells by time - lapse microscopy . Nontransfected and GFP - Rab21 - expressing NCI - H460 cells completed mitosis in 51 ± 8 min ( n = 5 cells ) after cell rounding upon entry into M phase ( Figure 2C ; Movie S2 ) , whereas Rab21GTP - expressing cells made futile attempts to complete mitosis for 398 ± 113 min ( n = 5 cells ) , ﬁnally resulting in cell binucleation ( Figure 2C ; Movie Figure 2 .

S2 ) . Similar results were obtained from GFP - Rab21 - and GFP - Rab21GTP - expressing MEFs ( Figure S1B ; Movie S3 ) . Defects in central spindle assembly lead to cytokinesis failure ( Glotzer , 2005 ) , and one key complex required for normal spindle forma - tion is the chromosome passenger protein complex ( CPC ) ( Ruchaud et al . , 2007 ) . To investigate whether expression of the Rab21GTP mutant impairs central spindle formation , we ex - amined the localization of CPC proteins Aurora B and Incenp during late mitotic phases . In these cells , both proteins localized normally to the inner centromeres during metaphase and be - tween the separated sister chromatids in early telophase ( Figure 2D ; Figure S2A ) , suggesting that Rab21GTP does not im - pair central spindle assembly . In 38 % ± 2 % ( n = 60 cells ) of the Rab21GTP - expressing cells , the formation of the mid - body failed ( Figure S2B ) . In these cells , Aurora B , Incenp , a - tubulin , and polo - like kinase 1 ( Plk1 ) failed to localize to the mid - body ( Figure 2D ; Figures S2A and S2C ) . These ﬁndings propose that Rab21 function is necessary for normal cytokinesis in adherent cells , and that the defect in cell division in Rab21GTP cells occurs after the formation of the central spindle . Integrin Targeting to the Cleavage Furrow Is Rab21 Dependent To investigate the speciﬁc role of Rab21 in the process , we si - lenced Rab21 with siRNA that has previously been shown to be speciﬁc for Rab21 , to inhibit migration identically to another Rab21 - targeting siRNA oligo , and not to inﬂuence the expres - sion levels of integrins , other endosomal Rabs , or EEA1 ( Pellinen et al . , 2006 ) . Importantly , partial silencing of Rab21 with siRNA ( (cid:2) 65 % ) , which inhibits integrin trafﬁcking ( Pellinen et al . , 2006 ) , also signiﬁcantly increased the number of multinucleated cells ( by 15 % ± 4 % ) compared to control siRNA - transfected cells ( Figure 3A ) . These ﬁndings with siRNA silencing indicate a speciﬁc role for Rab21 during cytokinesis . Since Rab21 regulates the endo / exocytic trafﬁcking of b 1 - integrins , and since active integrins localize to endocytic Rab21 vesicles in migrating cells ( Pellinen et al . , 2006 ) , we inves - tigated whether Rab21 regulates the localization of b 1 - integrins during mitosis . In mid - telophase , endogenous Rab21 and b 1 - integrin were found to overlap in the ingressing cleavage furrow ( Figure 3B , arrows ; Figure 3C , left panels , arrow ) , and b 1 - integrins were again detected at the base of the furrow adjacent to the matrix ( Figure 3B , z axis , arrowhead ) . Silencing of Rab21 expression prevented concentration of b 1 - integrin at the furrow ( Figure 3C , right panels ) , suggesting a role for Rab21 in the recruitment of the integrins to the furrow . In late telophase , b 1 - integrin and Rab21 were detected at the opposite poles of the daughter cells . Their localization overlapped in vesicles at the base of the integrin - containing lamellipodia formed by the sepa - rating daughter cells ( Figure 3B , arrows ) . Newly formed protru - sions containing b 1 - integrin were visible at the level of the matrix , suggesting that these rufﬂes are engaging matrix to assist mechanically in the separation of the two daughter cells ( Figure 3B , right panel , z axis , arrowheads ) . These data suggest that integrins play a mechanistic adhesive role during telophase . However , it is well established that integ - rin - matrix interactions generate intracellular signals regulating several pathways , including the activity of RhoA ( Ren et al . , 1999 ) . Active RhoA forms a narrow zone at the site of the forming contractile ring and is essential for furrowing and cytokinesis ( Bement et al . , 2005 ; Yuce et al . , 2005 ) . To evaluate whether ac - cumulation of b 1 - integrin at the furrow correlates with the local - ization of active RhoA in the furrow , we used an afﬁnity probe , based on the GFP - fused Rho - binding domain ( RBD ) of Rhotekin , which only binds to Rho in its active conformation ( Berdeaux et al . , 2004 ) . In the control cells , this probe bound preferably to a narrow zone in the cleavage furrow during telophase ( Figure 3D ) . The GFP - only probe was not detected in the furrow ( Figure 3D , bottom panels ) . In contrast , in Rab21 - silenced cells , the GFP - RBD probe accumulated to the furrow in only 22 % ± 6 % of the cells , compared to the 91 % ± 4 % of positive furrows in the control cells ( p = 0 . 001 ; n = 30 cells per group ) ( Figure 3D ) . In summary , Rab21 regulates the accumulation of integrins into the cleavage furrow , and integrin accumulation correlates with the localization of active RhoA in the furrow . Therefore , it is pos - sible that integrin signaling in the furrow may play a role in regu - lating RhoA activity in conjunction with known RhoA effectors ( Yuce et al . , 2005 ; Zhao and Fang , 2005 ) . b 1 - integrins can trafﬁc through a Rab11 - positive compart - ment ( Powelka et al . , 2004 ; Roberts et al . , 2001 ) and the Figure 3 .

Rab11 - binding protein FIP3 has emerged as a regulator of endosome transport to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis ( Fielding et al . , 2005 ; Simon et al . , 2008 ; Wilson et al . , 2005 ) . We investigated the role of FIP3 in the regulation of integrin local - ization during cytokinesis by silencing FIP3 . Transfection with a previously described FIP3 - speciﬁc siRNA oligo ( Wilson et al . , 2005 ) reduced FIP3 mRNA levels by 97 % ± 2 % relative to control siRNA - transfected cells ( qRT - PCR , n = 3 , p = 0 . 01 ) . We also observed that FIP3 - silenced cells were unable to complete cyto - kinesis , but arrested in mid / late telophase . In contrast to Rab21 - silenced cells , b 1 - integrin accumulated to the furrow during telophase in FIP3 - silenced and control cells ( Figure S3A , arrow ) . However , in line with the role of FIP3 in Rab11 - dependent recy - cling , FIP3 - silenced cells displayed accumulation of b 1 - integrin in the perinuclear region that was not detected in control or Rab21 - silenced cells ( Figure S3B ; data not shown ) . Silencing of FIP3 also induced abnormal actin ﬁlaments at the bottom of the dividing cells without signiﬁcantly interfering with actin local - ization at the furrow ( Figure S3C ) . Interestingly , simultaneous si - lencing of FIP3 and overexpression of GFP - Rab21 interfered with the ability of NCI - H460 cells to enter mitosis ( 0 out of more than 400 cells scored were in mitosis ) . Furthermore , silenc - ing of FIP3 has dramatic effects on GFP - Rab21 ( Figure S3D ) . GFP - Rab21 is localized to huge intracellular vacuoles in addition to smaller motile vesicles , possibly reﬂecting the cumulative effects of simultaneously enhancing endocytosis ( Rab21 ) and inhibiting recycling ( FIP3 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that both Rab21 and FIP3 are important in regulating integrin lo - calization in dividing cells , but that their functions are not fully overlapping , and that integrin accumulation to the cleavage furrow occurs in the absence of FIP3 . Since our results imply that cell division may involve the direc - tional movement of integrins and Rab21 , we investigated the localization of Rab21 and a 5 - integrin in live cells . Indeed , GFP - a 5 - integrin and DsRedm - Rab21 overlapped in late mitotic cells in vesicles accumulating ﬁrst to the vicinity of the ingressing cleavage furrow , and later in telophase to the opposite ends of the two spreading daughter cells ( Figure 3E ; Movie S4 ) . This was investigated further by tracking the movement of anti - body - labeled integrins at the furrow . Analysis of the trajectories of individual intracellular integrin vesicles ( on average , 103 vesi - cles per active furrow region [ 166 m m 2 ] ) demonstrated that , dur - ing early telophase , integrins trafﬁc toward the furrow ( Figure 3F ; Table S1 ; Movie S5 ) . In contrast , in Rab21 - silenced cells , we detected a smaller amount of endocytosed - labeled integrin ( on average , 68 vesicles per active furrow region ) , and the detected integrin vesicles were more stationary ( Table S1 ) . The directional movement toward the furrow was impaired in Rab21 - silenced cells ( Figure 3F ; Table S1 ; Movie S6 ) , and some vesicles were moving in the opposite direction ( Figure 3F , siRab21 , light - green and dark - green tracks ) . Interestingly , the silencing of FIP3 did not inﬂuence the number of integrin vesicles in the furrow signif - icantly ( on average , 95 vesicles per active furrow region ) , further supporting our ﬁnding that integrins accumulate to the furrow in FIP3 - silenced cells during cytokinesis ( Figure S3A ) . In late cyto - kinesis , trajectories revealed that in control cells integrins were trafﬁcking away from the mid - body toward the opposite end of the forming daughter cells ( Figure 3F ; Table S1 ; Movie S7 ) ; this movement was also impaired in Rab21 - silenced cells ( Figure 3F ; Table S1 ; Movie S8 ) . Taken together , Rab21 and integrin have overlapping localiza - tion in dividing cells . Loss of Rab21 function results in impaired integrin localization to the cleavage furrow and defective cytoki - nesis , leading to bi - and multinucleated cells . Rab21 Association with Integrin Is Necessary for Cytokinesis Rab21 regulates the trafﬁcking of all a / b 1 - integrin heterodimers ( including collagen - binding a 2 b 1 - integrin ) by associating with the conserved membrane - proximal GFFKR sequence present in almost all integrin a subunits ( Hynes , 2002 ) . Thus , by interfer - ing with integrin - Rab21 association via mutagenesis of an a sub - unit that pairs with the b 1 subunit , we can speciﬁcally address the requirement of Rab21 - regulated integrin trafﬁcking in sup - porting cytokinesis . CHO cells fail to express collagen - binding integrins ( Nykvist et al . , 2000 ) and thus can be reconstituted with mutant a 2 - integrins and subsequently investigated on colla - gen substrates . We found that CHO cells become bi - or multinu - cleate when they express Rab21GTP ( Figure S4A ) . Substitution of the highly conserved arginine ( R1161 ) with an alanine residue ( a 2AA mutant ) or disruption of the a - helical structure of the a 2 subunit’s cytoplasmic tail by exchanging the lysine residue ( K1162 ) with a proline ( a 2P mutant ) abolished the association of Rab21 with the a 2 ( Figure 4A ) ( Pellinen et al . , 2006 ) . Introduc - tion of wild - type integrin a 2 subunit rendered CHO cells able to adhere and divide on collagen as efﬁciently as on ﬁbronectin , to which they adhere via their endogenous a 5 b 1 ( Figure 2B ) . Strikingly , cells expressing mutant a 2 - integrins unable to recruit Rab21 ( a 2AA and a 2P ) adhered to collagen , but showed a bi - / multinucleate phenotype indicative of defective cytokinesis , whereas , on ﬁbronectin , the same cells appeared to undergo normal cytokinesis ( Figure 4B ) . These populations contained 64 % ± 9 % ( a 2AA ) and 78 % ± 12 % ( a 2P ) bi - or multinucleate cells when cultured on collagen ( Figure 4C ) and 2 % ± 1 % ( a 2AA ) and 4 % ± 1 % ( a 2P ) bi - or multinucleate cells when grown on ﬁbronectin . The a 2ARA mutant , which retains the ability to as - sociate with Rab21 ( Figure 4A ) ( Pellinen et al . , 2006 ) , supported normal cell division on collagen as well as on ﬁbronectin ( Figures 4B and 4C ) . These data suggest that the association of Rab21 with the conserved GFFKR sequence found in most integrin a subunits is necessary for cytokinesis . Next , we examined the trafﬁcking of a 2 b 1 - integrin by deter - mining the internalized and cell surface receptor - bound integrin fractions ( Roberts et al . , 2001 ) . As expected , the mutant a 2AA - integrin , which cannot associate with Rab21 , failed to undergo endo / exocytic trafﬁcking , whereas a 2ARA was efﬁciently inter - nalized from the cell surface ( Figure 4D ) . In line with these data , in individual confocal slices taken from the middle of the cell , a 2ARA was in vesicles in the cytoplasm and at the cleavage furrow ( 56 ± 8 vesicles per a 2ARA’s active furrow region ) in ( E ) Subcellularlocalizationof a 2AAand a 2ARAinadividingcell .

In contrast , the a 2AA mutant was de - tected as being evenly distributed along the plasma membrane and only in very few vesicles close to the furrow ( 6 ± 3 vesicles per a 2AA’s active furrow region ) ( Figure 4E ) . Taken together , the loss of integrin trafﬁcking either due to the expression of the Rab21GTP mutant or defective integrin - Rab21 association causes mitotic errors , resulting in multinucleate progeny cells . Mutagenesis of Conserved b 1 - Integrin NXXY Motifs Blocks Endocytosis and Cytokinesis The exact pathways involved in the endocytosis of integrins are not clearly deﬁned and seem to vary between integrin hetero - dimers ( Ramsay et al . , 2007 ; Upla et al . , 2004 ) . However , recent reports have implicated clathrin - coated structures in the endo - cytosis of integrins ( Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ; Ramsay et al . , 2007 ) . The cytoplasmic domains of b - integrins contain two conserved NXXY motifs required in other cell surface recep - tors for clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Le Roy and Wrana , 2005 ) , suggesting that they also might be involved in the regula - tion of integrin endocytosis . We therefore investigated the endocytic trafﬁcking in b 1 - integrin null MEFs expressing either wild - type b 1 - integrins or b 1 - integrins in which the tyrosine residues of the cytoplasmic domain were substituted with phenylalanines ( b 1YY783 , 795FF ) ( Wennerberg et al . , 2000 ) . Wild - type b 1 - integrin expressed in GD25 cells localized to intracellular structures and focal adhesions ( Figure 5A , arrowheads and arrows ) , whereas b 1YY783 , 795FF - integrins localized to prominent focal adhe - sions , typical of cells with inhibited focal adhesion turnover ( Ezratty et al . , 2005 ) . Furthermore , wild - type b 1 - integrin was rap - idly endocytosed from the cell surface ( Figure 5A ) . In contrast , b 1YYFF - integrin showed reduced endocytosis ( Figure 5A ) . This was not due to an overall trafﬁcking defect since the endocytosis of labeled transferrin was unaltered in cells expressing the mu - tant integrins ( Figure S4B ) . The GD25 cells are derived from dif - ferentiated b 1 - integrin - deﬁcient embryonic stem cells ( Fassler and Meyer , 1995 ) and therefore could have some speciﬁc fea - tures not observed in normally differentiated cells . To further ver - ify the role of b 1 - integrin NXXY motifs in integrin endocytosis , we investigated integrin endocytosis in b 1 wild - type and b 1YYFF MEFs isolated and cloned from E13 . 5 embryos , which carry the mutation in the germline ( Czuchra et al . , 2006 ) . Also , in these cell clones derived from the b 1YYFF embryos , integrin endocy - tosis was reduced compared to cells derived from wild - type b 1 - integrin littermates ( Figure 5B ) . Since clathrin - mediated endocytosis is important for cytokine - sis ( Figure S4C ) ( Niswonger and O’Halloran , 1997 ) , we examined cytokinesis of the embryo - derived wild - type and b 1YYFF cells on selective matrices . Laminin is only recognized by b 1 - integ - rins , whereas adhesion to vitronectin is mainly mediated via b 3 - integrins ( Hynes , 2002 ) . We exploited this speciﬁcity to inves - tigate whether endocytosis - deﬁcient b 1YYFF MEFs are able to divide on laminin . We found that b 1YYFF cells cultured on vitro - nectin were mainly mononuclear , whereas the same cells on laminin were signiﬁcantly more frequently bi - and multinucleate ( Figures 5C and 5D , arrowheads ) . In accordance with this ﬁnding , ES cell - derived GD25 b 1 null cells reconstituted with wild - type b 1 - integrin appeared normal on laminin and vitronec - tin . In contrast , GD25 cells reconstituted with b 1YYFF became bi - or multinucleate , speciﬁcally on laminin , where adhesion is mediated via the mutant integrin alone ( Figure 6A , arrows ; Figure S4D ) . Overexpression of Rab21 stimulates integrin trafﬁcking and in - creases cell migration on b 1 - integrin substrates ( Pellinen et al . , 2006 ) . To analyze whether the defective cell division of b 1YYFF cells on laminin is due to impaired integrin trafﬁcking , we tested whether overexpression of Rab21 could rescue the multinucle - ate phenotype of the GD25 b 1YYFF cells . Overexpression of Rab21 , but not of Rab7 , which does not associate with b 1 - integ - rins ( Pellinen et al . , 2006 ) , indeed rescued the multinucleated phenotype ( Figure 6A ; Figure S4D ) and integrin endocytosis ( Figure 6B ) in GD25 b 1YYFF cells . Interestingly , whereas endocy - tosis of wild - type b 1 - integrin was sensitive to inhibition of clathrin by mono - dansyl - cadaverin ( MDC ) ( Davies et al . , 1980 ) , the Rab21 - induced endocytosis of b 1YYFF - integrin was MDC insensitive ( Figures S5A and S5B ) . Thus , these data suggest that in the context of the mutant b 1 - integrin Rab21 expression induces integrin trafﬁcking by stimulating some form of clathrin - independent endocytosis . Previous work has demonstrated that , in the absence of func - tional b 1 - integrin , MEFs upregulate the expression of b 3 - integrin ( Danen et al . , 2002 ) . This was also the case in the b 1YYFF - expressing cells . Surface expression of endogenous b 3 - integrin was low in GD25 b 1 cells ( mean ﬂuorescence intensity [ MFI ] = 105 ) , whereas in GD25 b 1YYFF cells expression of b 3 was upre - gulated ( MFI = 1253 ) similarly to what has been demonstrated for b 1 null cells ( Retta et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , we observed that in GD25 b 1 cells b 1 - integrin , but not b 3 - integrin , accumulated in the cleavage furrow . In contrast , in GD25 b 1YYFF cells , the upregu - lated b 3 instead of the mutant b 1 was recruited to the furrow ( Figure 6C ) . Therefore , our data suggest that b 3 - integrin is upre - gulated to compensate for the previously unknown inability of mutant b 1 - integrin to undergo trafﬁcking and thus support cytokinesis . Finally , we tested the ability of Rab21 to rescue cytokinesis in the context of an integrin with mutations in Rab21 association . We expressed Rab21 together with a 2wt - or a 2AA - integrins in CHO cells cultured on collagen . Rab21 - expressing a 2AA cells remained bi - or multinucleate on collagen ( Figure 6D , arrows ; Figure S4E ) , demonstrating that Rab21 facilitates cytokinesis speciﬁcally via its ability to associate with integrins and stimulate their endocytosis . Cancer Cells Harboring a Rab21 Deletion Are Multinucleate A recent report suggests that tetraploid cells , forming as a result of cytokinesis failure , have an increased number of chromosome rearrangements , directly facilitating malignant transformation and tumorigenesis ( Fujiwara et al . , 2005 ) . Since our data strongly suggest that Rab21 is necessary for normal cell division , and that impaired Rab21 function results in multiploidy , we investigated the RAB21 gene in human cancer . We performed array CGH analysis of two ovarian carcinoma cell lines ( parental KF28 and variant KFr13 ) and found a deletion in the RAB21 locus on chro - mosome 12 in the KFr13cells ( Figure 7A ) . The deletion resulted in a signiﬁcant loss of RAB21 mRNA and protein expression when compared to the parental KF28 cells with an intact RAB21 gene locus ( Figure 7B ) . In contrast , protein levels of b 1 - integrin and Developmental Cell Integrin Trafﬁcking Regulates Cytokinesis 378 Developmental Cell 15 , 371 – 385 , September 16 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . Rab5 were identical in KF28 and KFr13 cells ( data not shown ) . In - terestingly , a similar chromosomal deletion involving the RAB21 locus and also leading to loss of RAB21 expression was seen in a prostate cancer tumor sample ( Figure S6 ; data not shown ) . We investigated whether loss of the Rab21 gene altered the phenotype of these cells . Freshly plated Rab21 - negative KFr13 cells displayed increased accumulation of multinucleate cells ( after 24 hr , 16 % ± 6 % , n = 100 ; p = 0 . 0003 two - sample test for equality ) ( Figure 7C , arrows ) , when compared to Rab21 - expressing KF28 cells ( 0 % ; n = 100 ) . Importantly , these results correlate well with the phenotype of Rab21 - silenced NCI - H460 cells ( Figure 3A ) .

By con - trast , expression of the GFP - Rab21GTP mutant resulted in a further increase in the multinucleate phenotype ( Figure 7D ) . Furthermore , silencing of Rab21 in KF28 cells phenocopied the multinucleate phenotype of the KFr13 cells ( Figure 7E ) . Thus , RAB21 inactivation caused by acquired genetic changes in cancer could be functionally linked to multinucleation in a way analogous to our experimental models . This suggests that dysre - gulation of integrin trafﬁcking by mechanisms such as Rab21 inactivation may give rise to multinucleation and contribute to genetic instability and tumor progression . DISCUSSION We have demonstrated that Rab21 controls the endosomal traf - ﬁcking of integrins , which is required for the successful comple - tion of cytokinesis . These results provide mechanistic insight into the over 2 - decade - old observations that matrix adhesion is a prerequisite for the division of adherent cells ( Ben - Ze’ev and Raz , 1981 ; Orly and Sato , 1979 ) . We further demonstrate that the RAB21 gene locus can be deleted in cancer , resulting in mul - tinucleate cells . This provides one example of how genetic insta - bility may arise from cellular multinucleation due to impaired Figure 6 .

Both aspects have important implications for human disease . Anchorage - independent growth is a hallmark of cancer .

Integrins may have several functions in the cleavage furrow . Our experiments dem - onstrate that integrin accumulation to the furrow must be able to engage the matrix to support cytokinesis . Therefore , it is likely that one important function of integrins in the furrow is to provide mechanical anchoring for the contractile actomyosin ring . The contractile ring assembly is directed by RhoA via activation of myosin and induction of actin nucleation ( Glotzer , 2005 ) . Integ - rins are known regulators of RhoA activity ( Hall , 2005 ) , and thus integrins directed to the furrow might contribute to locally regulate RhoA activity . This possibility is supported by our data showing that , in the absence of functional Rab21 , localization of active RhoA to the furrow is impaired . The integrin b subunit may also be necessary to recruit focal adhesion proteins like a - actinin and talin to the cleavage furrow ( Bellissent - Waydelich et al . , 1999 ; Fujiwara et al . , 1978 ) . Integrins are known to assem - ble complex signaling modules at sites of adhesion ( Zaidel - Bar et al . , 2007 ) , and the assembly of similar complexes governing cytokinesis - speciﬁc signaling molecules may exist . Therefore , it is reasonable to assume that integrins are required in the tem - poral assembly and that anchoring of the contractile ring is needed for normal cytokinesis . In this study , we have investigated the role of integrins and their trafﬁcking in cells undergoing cytokinesis . Our results demonstrate that , ﬁrst , b 1 - integrins trafﬁc in a spatiotemporally controlled manner to the ingressing cleavage furrow and later to the opposing poles of the daughter cells during cytokinesis ( a schematic representation is shown in Figure S7 ) . Second , Rab21 association with the conserved GFFKR sequence in the integrin a subunit regulates trafﬁcking of integrins during cytokinesis . Third , clathrin - and Rab21 - dependent endocytosis of the receptor both contribute to integrin trafﬁcking to the fur - row . Fourth , Rab21 expression can compensate for the abro - gation of putative clathrin - binding sites in the integrin b 1 tail and rescue trafﬁcking and cytokinesis by directing b 1YYFF en - docytosis to a non - clathrin - dependent pathway . Our ﬁndings that mutant integrins undergoing reduced integrin trafﬁcking fail to support cytokinesis when matrix adhesion is mediated solely by the mutant integrin heterodimer ( Figures 4 and 6 ) are in line with a similar observation made in vivo . Loss of b 1 - integrin expression results in a cytokinesis defect in chon - drocytes that adhere via different members of the b 1 - integrin subfamily ( a 1 b 1 , a 2 b 1 , a 10 b 1 , and a 11 b 1 ) to the collagen II matrix in the cartilage ( Aszodi et al . , 2003 ) . Moreover , b 1YYFF mutant keratinocytes , adhering to the complex matrix of the epidermal - dermal basement membrane with several integrin subfamilies , show no obvious defects in vivo ( Czuchra et al . , 2006 ) , whereas cells isolated from these mice fail to execute cytokinesis on a b 1 - speciﬁc matrix in vitro ( Figure 5 ) . Further - more , a previous study has demonstrated that an inactive mu - tant integrin is also unable to support cytokinesis ( Reverte et al . , 2006 ) , further underlining the mechanistic adhesive role of integrins in cytokinesis . Importantly , the mutant b 1YYFF - integrin is however fully active ( data not shown ) . Therefore , our ﬁndings are , to the best of our knowledge , the ﬁrst to pro - vide evidence that impaired integrin trafﬁcking may be linked to an abortive cell cycle , and changes in integrin subcellular local - ization , regulated by Rab21 , need to be precisely timed during cell division . It is well established by many reports that endo / exocytic traf - ﬁcking of membranes is necessary during cytokinesis . Thus far , membrane trafﬁcking to the furrow has been shown to support the polarized deposition of lipids and proteins to the furrow , and the addition of new membrane to provide the necessary sur - face is required for furrow ingression ( for a review , see [ Simon and Prekeris , 2008 ] ) . Our data show that in addition to the gen - eral requirement for membrane trafﬁcking during cytokinesis , speciﬁc trafﬁcking of integrins is important for the process in ad - herent cells . We show that in addition to Rab21 , FIP3 is required for spatiotemporal control of integrin localization during cytoki - nesis . Our data show that b 1 - integrins can be delivered to the furrow in the absence of FIP3 , but that in FIP3 - silenced cells ar - rested in telophase , a pool of perinuclear b 1 - integrin persists . It is possible that trafﬁcking of these receptors is necessary for the subsequent separation of daughter cells , which involves the formation of new integrin - positive protrusions . Tetraploid cells represent genetically unstable intermediates that develop into aneuploid cells due to the inability of these cells to segregate their chromosomes correctly ( Barr and Gruneberg , 2007 ) . We show here that the RAB21 gene can be deleted in hu - man cancer ( Figure 7 ; Figure S5 ) , and that this results in multinu - cleation , which can be rescued by the reintroduction of Rab21 . These ﬁndings suggest an interesting mechanism for how one genetic alteration in cancer can promote failure in normal cell division and thus result in further genetic instability . Taken together , these ﬁndings reveal a molecular mechanism by which Rab21 governs integrin endosomal trafﬁcking during cytokinesis and raise the possibility that alterations in integrin trafﬁcking may lead to the development of genetic instability as a result of cytokinesis failure . This is likely to be relevant in human malignancies in which impaired mitosis leading to polyploidy has been proposed as a causative effect in the formation of aneu - ploidy and in the promotion of cancer progression ( Storchova and Pellman , 2004 ) . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Details of DNA constructs , siRNA sequences , antibodies , and the generation of mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) from b 1wt and b 1YYFF mice ( Czuchra et al . , 2006 ) are described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Cell Culture , DNA Transfection , and RNA Interference NCI - H460 , Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) , and HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC . GD25 mouse ﬁbroblasts have been described ( Wennerberg et al . , 2000 ) , and KFr13 and KF28 cells ( Kikuchi et al . , 1986 ) were a generous gift from Dr . N . Sasaki . All DNA constructs were transfected by using Lipofect - amine2000 ( Invitrogen ) .
