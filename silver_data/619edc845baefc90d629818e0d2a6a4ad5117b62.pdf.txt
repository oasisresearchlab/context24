INTRODUCTION In eukaryotic cells , the structure and dynamics of the cellular actin network are tightly regulated in space and time by a large number of actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) ( 1 ) . Nevertheless , upon bacterial in - fection , the host cell cytoskeleton is rapidly subverted by bacterial effectors , including ABPs , which are essential for invasion and path - ogenesis by many microbial pathogens ( 2 ) . The human pathogen Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium ( Salmonella typhimu - rium ) uses the type III secretion system ( T3SS ) encoded chromo - somally on the Salmonella pathogenicity island - 1 ( SPI - 1 ) , a molecular machine used to secrete a cocktail of specific proteins in a hierarchical sequence into host cells to promote host cell entry at the invasion site by inducing local membrane ruffling ( 3 ) . Salmonella T3SS effector SopE , acting as a guanine nucleotide ex - change factor mimic , can directly activate Rho guanosine triphos - phatases to induce membrane ruffling , while the phosphoinositide phosphatase SopB can recruit sorting nexin protein SNX18 to facil - itate membrane ruffling formation ( 4 , 5 ) . Two particular Salmonella T3SS substrates , SipC and SipA , are delivered into host cells to manipulate the cell cytoskeleton at bac - terial attachment sites during bacterial invasion ( 6 ) . Both contain actin - binding domains that share no discernible sequence similarity with other known ABPs or with each other . Upon T3SS - mediated secretion , SipC integrates into the host cell membrane and assem - bles together with SipB , the second component of the translocon , into a pore - like structure that presumably serves as an interaction site at the tip of T3SS ( 7 , 8 ) and provides the structural scaffold for effector protein translocation into cells . SipC has been hypothesized to play a central role at these focal infection sites due to its actin bundling activity ( 6 , 9 , 10 ) , its ability to nucleate actin via its soluble C - terminal domain ( 9 ) , and its stimulation of focal plasma membrane expansion by recruiting host cell exocytotic vesicles through binding to the exocyst complex ( 11 ) . Furthermore , SipC is also able to recruit lysosome - associated membrane protein 1 to prevent targeting of invading bacterial cells to lysosomes ( 12 ) . The translocon pore is a prerequisite for delivery of late effectors , which are thought to be transported through the central part of the pore ( 13 ) . SipA is the first of the late effectors to be delivered ( 14 ) and is cleaved by host cell caspase - 3 into two functional fragments ( 15 ) . The N - terminal SipA fragment can recruit the host soluble N - ethylmaleimide – sensitive fusion protein attachment protein recep - tors components to Salmonella - containing vacuoles ( SCVs ) and promotes Salmonella survival by mimicking the early endosome ( 16 ) . Previously , low - resolution electron microscopy ( EM ) maps of F - actin - SipA show that the C - terminal SipA fragment binds along the F - actin groove in an 1 : 1 molar ratio and the two flexible arms of SipA connect the two long actin helical strands to stabilize actin filaments as a molecular stapler ( 17 , 18 ) . Noteworthy , SipA has a much greater stabilization effect on F - actin stabilization than the bicyclic peptide phalloidin , a commonly used F - actin stabilizer ( 19 ) . Cooperation between SipA and SipC likely through the actin nucle - ation and bundling activity leads to the formation of large actin bundles that generate filopodial - like membrane protrusions at the invasion site ( 6 ) . However , the mechanistic interplay between these two bacterial proteins , in which SipA resides as a soluble protein within the host cell cytoplasm and SipC is restricted to the host cell plasma membrane , remains unknown , especially in the context of the numerous other cellular ABPs . To unravel how SipA and SipC subvert the cellular cytoskeleton , we used cryo - EM and single - particle analysis of polymerizing actin filaments in vitro . Unlikely to the previous models , on the basis of low - resolution EM maps reconstructed from negative - stain EM data of F - actin - SipA , our near atomic resolution cryo - EM map of F - actin - SipA reveals that the binding of SipA is accomplished by a central globular domain and a flanking C - terminal domain , 1 University Medical Center Hamburg - Eppendorf ( UKE ) , Institute of Structural and Systems Biology , Hamburg , Germany . 2 Centre for Structural Systems Biology ( CSSB ) , Hamburg , Germany . 3 Deutsches Elektronen - Synchrotron Zentrum ( DESY ) , Hamburg , Germany . 4 Institute for Biophysical Chemistry , Hannover Medical School , Hannover , Germany . 5 Technology Platform Light Microscopy ( TPLM ) , Universityof Hamburg , Hamburg , Germany . 6 Technology Platform Micros - copy and Image Analysis ( TP MIA ) , Leibniz Institute of Virology ( LIV ) , Hamburg , Germany . 7 University Medical Center Hamburg - Eppendorf ( UKE ) , Institute for Bio - chemistry and Signal Transduction , Hamburg , Germany . * Corresponding author .

Adv . 9 , eadj5777 ( 2023 ) 8 December 2023 1 of 14 both of which are responsible for the unique binding ratio : one SipA to two actin subunits . The efficiency of SipA binding is improved by the translocon component SipC . The binding of SipA leads to a marked stabilization of the filaments even under substoichiometric conditions , underscoring the development of an elegant and effi - cient infection strategy at the molecular level during the evolution of Salmonella pathogenesis . RESULTS SipA constantly modulates the actin network during Salmonella infection To gain insights into the role of SipA - mediated reorganization of the host cell actin network , we first examined the localization of SipA and actin during Salmonella infection . HeLa cells were chal - lenged with S . typhimurium cells expressing a chromosomally encoded SipA variant with a C - terminal hemagglutinin ( HA ) – tag ( 20 ) , and the distribution of the bacterial effector SipA and the as - sociated cellular actin network was monitored using fluorescence microscopy . Four different distribution patterns could be distin - guished between the 15 - and 30 - min time points ( Fig . 1A and fig . S1A ) : SipA molecules were evenly distributed inside a Salmonella cell , which is attached to a HeLa cell ( pattern 1 ) ; SipA colocalized with F - actin close to the plasma membrane , and Salmonella cells attached to HeLa cells ( pattern 2 ) ; the signal for SipA was detected largely outside of the bacterial cells but remained in the immediate vicinity of the SCV ( pattern 3 ) ; and the SCV - exposed SipA colocal - ized with F - actin ( pattern 4 ) . The populations of patterns 1 and 3 were both less than 10 % of the overall population and marginally changed between the 15 min and 30 min after start of the experi - ment ( fig . S1B ) . Most Salmonella cells that are not in the process of invading the host cell are washed away during the immunostain - ing procedure , leading to the small proportion of cells in pattern 1 . The observation that pattern 4 becomes predominant after 30 min suggests that pattern 4 represents the latest stage of infection ( fig . S1B ) . The nanomolar binding affinity of SipA to actin filaments ( 3 ) suggests that SCV surface – exposed SipA is able to quickly recruit surrounding actin molecules , which leads to a rapid transi - tion from pattern 3 to pattern 4 . Consequently , the fraction of pattern 3 at the time of imaging is always small . On the basis of these observations , we propose a model for the invasion process of Salmonella . At first , before invasion , SipA mol - ecules remain inside bacterial cells ( stage 1 : SipA loading stage ) . Shortly after attachment to HeLa cells , Salmonella starts injecting SipA ( 21 ) , which is colocalized with F - actin close to the plasma membrane ( stage 2 : SipA injection stage ) . After the bacterial cell is internalized and resides in an SCV , SipA is constantly secreted via SPI - 1 T3SS ( 22 ) ( stage 3 : SipA SCV injection stage ) . Last , SCV - exposed SipA recruits new F - actin , establishing a distinct actin network around the SCVs ( stage 4 : SCV actin network stage ) . SipA binds to F - actin in a unique binding pattern The fact that , during infection , a single actin - binding domain of SipA ( amino acids 434 to 685 ) is released into the host cell cyto - plasm by caspase - 3 suggests that all the observed intracellular stages of infection are caused by the same mechanism of SipA binding to actin . On the basis of earlier structural and biochemical data , it has been hypothesized that SipA functions as a molecular staple in which two nonglobular arms emanating from the central globular domain of SipA tether two actin subunits from two oppos - ing strands of the same filament ( 17 , 18 ) . A repeated arrangement would then affect filament polymerization and stabilization . However , the atomic details of such a mechanism have not yet been resolved either by x - ray crystallography or cryo - EM . More - over , in an in infectio context , it is likely that the ratio of ( cleaved ) SipA molecules to actin molecules varies , is nonstoichio - metric , and may influence actin stabilization . To examine the importance of the stoichiometry of SipA for F - actin stabilization , we first measured the effect of SipA β ( SipA 426 – 685 ) concentration on actin depolymerization as a proxy for filament stabilization . SipA β , representing the C - terminal fragment of SipA cleaved by caspase 3 ( 15 ) , strongly stabilized filaments at a molar ratio of 1 : 1 and was evidently effective even at a molar ratio of 1 : 100 ( Fig . 2A ) . This demonstrates that SipA β is capable of modulating the cellular actin network , supporting the idea of highly specialized and effective molecules during infection operating at substoichiometric concentrations . To gain direct structural insights into the interaction of SipA with F - actin , we determined the structure of SipA β bound to F - actin by cryo - EM ( fig . S2 , A to C ) . To our surprise , we found that SipA β interacts with F - actin in a unique , alternating binding pattern by which its globular domain is located in the F - actin groove between the two opposing actin strands , leaving out every other binding pocket ( fig . S2D ) . We also noticed that the complex could not be refined to resolutions better than 5 Å at the SipA β region , which we attribute to a nonuniform binding pattern and the overall low SipA occupancy ( 21 . 2 % ; fig . S2B ) . Despite the fact that the structure at this resolution is distinct from previous work ( 17 , 18 ) , our attempt to understand atomic details of the binding interface required us to use a new construct to improve the resolution . Thus , we generated a smaller version of SipA ( SipA α : SipA 497 – 669 ) ( 17 ) omitting regions that were predicted to be largely disordered using IUPred3 ( 23 ) ( fig . S2E ) and resolved the structure of SipA α – F - actin to an overall resolution of 2 . 6 Å ( Fig . 2 , B and C , and fig . S3 , A and B ) . The central and heart - shaped domain of SipA was well resolved by cryo - EM ( fig . S3C ) , and it fits well inside one F - actin pocket formed by three adjacent actin subunits from two helical strands with the C - terminal arm ex - tending toward the adjacent F - actin pocket in the direction of the pointed end ( PE ) of the filament , preventing a second heart - shaped domain from entering this pocket ( Fig . 2C ) . Similarly to SipA β , the shorter SipA α molecules bind in a unique molar ratio of 1 : 2 along the groove between the two helical strands of F - actin , a binding region that is used to stabilize filamentous actin by unrelated mol - ecules such as the bicyclic peptide phalloidin from the death cup mushroom Amanita phalloides ( 24 ) ( molar ratio 1 : 1 ) or by nebulin , a long , multirepeat protein present in skeletal muscle within myofibrils ( 25 ) ( molar ratio per super repeat , 1 : 1 ) . The fact that this specific binding site is not used by the majority of known host ABPs such as filamin A , T - plastin , or cofilin allows SipA - me - diated actin network modulation during bacterial infection ( Fig . 2D ) ( 26 – 28 ) . Robust interaction sites between SipA and F - actin As an F - actin stabilizer , SipA binds with a footprint that contacts three adjacent G - actin subunits and contains multiple charged res - idues ( Fig . 3A and table S1 ) . We constructed SipA β variants with amino acid substitutions designed to probe the interaction S C I E N C E A D VA N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E Yuan et al . , Sci . Adv . 9 , eadj5777 ( 2023 ) 8 December 2023 2 of 14 interfaces and their effect on stabilizing F - actin without disrupting binding . We selectively substituted two or three charged interface residues at a time in different regions of the heart - shaped domain and tested their binding ability of the variant proteins by cosedi - mentation with F - actin . The SipA β variants were designated M1 ( H536E / H539E ) , M2 ( R551E / K552E / E555R ) , M3 ( R565E / R566E / D569R ) , M4 ( K618E / E621R ) , and M5 ( R628E / E629R ) ( Fig . 3A and table S2 ) . M1 to M5 bound F - actin at similar ratios to wild - type SipA β suggesting redundancy of the different interfaces ( Fig . 3B and fig . S4A ) . Unexpectedly , all five SipA β variants were impaired in stabilizing F - actin during depolymerization as com - pared to wild - type SipA β , albeit to varying degrees , with variants M2 and M5 exhibiting the weakest effect of filament stabilization ( Fig . 3C and fig . S4B ) . To determine whether stabilization of F - actin by SipA β is part of the Salmonella infection mechanism , we generated two S . typhimurium strains with mutations in sipA en - coding the same substitutions as SipA β variants M2 and M5 , denoted as sipA M2 and sipA M5 , respectively , and performed in - fection and colocalization assays . Although the two SipA variant proteins were still associated with the cellular actin network ( Fig . 3D ) , the invasion rates of the M2 and M5 mutant strains were attenuated compared to wild - type S . typhimurium ( Fig . 3E ) , suggesting that stabilization of actin filaments during infection con - tributes to Salmonella invasion . SipA β does not affect nucleation or elongation but completely inhibits cofilin - mediated filament severing To assess the effect of SipA β on actin assembly in real time , we com - pared the spontaneous birth and elongation of actin filaments from 1 μM G - actin in the absence or presence of super folder green fluo - rescent protein ( sGFP ) – tagged SipA β in vitro by total internal re - flection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( Fig . 4A and movie S1 ) . Notably , at a concentration of 1 μM , SipA β fully decorated the growing filaments and induced the formation of flexible bundles Fig . 1 . SipA differentially modulates the actin network during Salmonella host cell entry .

S5 ) , strongly suggesting that SipA β does not affect actin assem - bly but rather associates with the filaments after their formation . In an attempt to better visualize the association of SipA β with the fil - aments , we then analyzed filament assembly in the presence of sub - stoichiometric concentrations of GFP - SipA β ( 0 . 002 μM ) . Unexpectedly , even at this very low concentration , sGFP - SipA β was immediately visible on the filaments , suggesting a high affinity in the low - nanomolar or subnanomolar range and / or a fast association rate constant . As a consequence , within a short period of time , sGFP - SipA β was completely depleted from solution , which then led to the growth of entirely undecorated filaments , highlight - ing the irreversible association of SipA β with filaments ( movie S1 ) . To explore whether the strong association of SipA β with the actin filaments interferes with the binding and activity of other ABPs , we then performed TIRF microscopy experiments with α - actinin 4 , T - plastin , fascin , and cofilin I , respectively .

Adv . 9 , eadj5777 ( 2023 ) 8 December 2023 6 of 14 noticeably perturbed by SipA β , confirming that these ABPs engage different binding sites on the F - actin from SipA β ( movies S2 and S3 ) . In contrast , the formation of the extremely rigid F - actin bundles induced by fascin was strongly impaired by SipA β . These bundles were more flexible than in the absence of SipA β and had splayed ends , a behavior never observed with fascin alone ( movie S4 ) . Notably , the zippering velocity of bundles in the presence of fascin was reduced more than sixfold in the presence of SipA β from 633 ± 162 ( mean ± SD ) to 98 ± 72 subunits / s ( Fig . 4 , D and E , and movie S5 ) . Therefore , SipA ’ s interference with fascin - medi - ated actin bundling could lead to a larger pool of individual actin filaments that can be stabilized . Last , we analyzed the binding of enhanced GFP ( EGFP ) - labeled cofilin I to F - actin filaments and subsequent filament severing in the absence or presence of SipA β . As expected , cofilin I ( 0 . 5 μM ) first bound preferentially to aged adenosine 5 0 - diphosphate ( ADP ) – F - actin in a discontinuous fashion and subsequently deco - rated the entire filament except for the growing tip due to cooper - ative binding ( 29 ) , with filament severing occurring at the interface of decorated and nondecorated regions of the filaments ( movie S6 ) . Notably , in the presence of both cofilin I ( 0 . 5 μM ) and substoichio - metric untagged SipA β ( 0 . 1 μM ) , cofilin I binding to F - actin fila - ments and , hence , filament severing was completely abolished ( movie S6 ) , which is consistent with a previous study using fluores - cence imaging of fixed specimens and sedimentation assays ( 3 ) . To allow simultaneous visualization of all proteins in the reaction , we used triple - color TIRF microscopy using Atto655 - spiked G - actin , EGFP – cofilin I , and surface 549 – labeled SNAP - SipA β . As shown in Fig . 4 ( F and G ) , EGFP - cofilin I and SNAP - SipA β bound to actin filaments in distinct , largely nonoverlapping regions , with fil - ament severing occurring only between bare and cofilin - decorated segment boundaries devoid of SipA β ( movie S7 ) . Together , our data are consistent with the view that , after T3SS - mediated translocation in host cells , the late effector SipA both maintains a larger pool of actin filaments by interference with fascin - mediated actin bundling and cofilin I filament severing and stabilizes actin filaments . Together with the observation of the cooperation between SipC and SipA from previous work ( 6 , 9 ) , our results raise the question of whether SipA acts alone or in conjunction with SipC on actin . SipC is a substrate of the T3SS that occupies an intermediate position in the hierarchical secretion sequence , is anchored as part of the membrane - associated translo - con , and contains an actin - binding domain at the C terminus ( SipCc : SipC 200 – 409 ) that is involved in actin filament nucleation . SipC enhances SipA decoration of ADP - P i F - actin To examine the effect of SipC on the binding of SipA to actin , we incubated G - actin with SipA β and SipCc ( fig . S6A ) under the same conditions used for determining the actin - bound structures of SipA β and SipA α as shown in Fig . 2C and fig . S2D . Notably , during image processing of our cryo - EM data , we noticed that in the presence of SipCc , actin segments were completely decorated by SipA β in the 1 : 2 stoichiometry ( 98 . 8 % occupancy ) , a behavior we only observed in the absence of SipCc for the shorter SipA α con - struct ( 92 . 2 % occupancy ) , but not with the longer in vivo – like SipA β construct ( 21 . 2 % occupancy ) ( Fig . 5A ) . This suggests that SipCc promotes the binding of SipA β to actin filaments , which would lead to increased occupancy of actin filaments by SipA β at the site of invasion . The mechanism by which SipCc promotes SipA β binding to actin filaments remains unclear , as no SipCc density was visible in our reconstructions ( fig . S6 , B and C ) . SipCc is pre - dicted to be largely unstructured ( fig . S6D ) , and the resulting flex - ibility could enable repeated nucleation of actin polymerization . Despite the lack of SipCc density , the addition of SipCc allowed us to resolve the structure of actin - bound SipA β to near - atomic res - olution ( Fig . 5B and fig . S6C ) . The SipA β construct includes the entire C - terminal fragment produced by caspase - 3 cleavage of full - length SipA , so this structure represents the complete SipA − F - actin complex . We found that the N - terminal arm remains un - structured and the fully resolved C - terminal arm ( residues 660 to 685 ) extends deep inside the F - actin pocket ( Fig . 5 , B and C ) . This binding only marginally influences the conformation of the central heart - shaped domain [ root mean square deviation ( RMSD ) , 0 . 77 Å ; Fig . 5D ] . The binding interface for the C - terminal arm is located in the vicinity of the binding interface of the com - monly used F - actin stabilizer phalloidin ( 24 ) , indicating that the C - terminal arm could contribute to F - actin stabilization . SipA β sta - bilizes F - actin more strongly than SipA α , which does not contain the extended arms ( Fig . 5E ) . Unexpectedly , our structural analysis also revealed that SipA binds exclusively to the “ young ” ADP – inorganic phosphate ( P i ) actin ( fig . S6E ) as opposed to cofilin I , which preferentially binds aged ADP - actin and at a different binding site than SipA ( 28 ) . This explains the differential decoration observed in our TIRF mi - croscopy measurements ( Fig . 4F ) and supports the idea that SipA binds shortly after SipC - catalyzed actin nucleation to stabilize fila - ments . Notably , the fact that our structure was determined in a buffer lacking phosphate , suggests that the phosphate visible in SipA - bound young actin originates from adenosie 5 ’ - triphosphate ( ATP ) hydrolysis . This is in contrast to earlier studies where it cannot be ruled out that the phosphate originates from phos - phate - containing buffers ( 30 , 31 ) . Furthermore , our structural anal - ysis revealed that the “ back door ” formed by R177 , N111 , H73 , and G74 ( 30 ) is stabilized in a closed conformation in the presence of SipA ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . This suggests that SipA binds to young actin filaments and keeps them in a young state by preventing the release of inorganic phosphate , presumably through the back door . To further substantiate this hypothesis , we conducted a phosphate release assay revealing a reduction in phosphate release from poly - merized F - actin when SipA was present ( Fig . 6C ) . Together , our data suggest that a coordinated interplay of SipC with SipA leads to the decoration of young actin filaments by SipA , followed by sta - bilization of the actin filaments through intersubunit binding of the C - terminal arm of SipA . This stabilization process also involves de - laying phosphate release through the closure of the actin back door . DISCUSSION Here , we uncovered how the bacterial effector SipA acts as a strong stabilizer of F - actin : First , it binds F - actin in a unique pattern that is distinct from any other known actin binding molecule . Second , it uses multiple interface residues to interact with high affinity . Third , it prevents P i release and maintains F - actin in a young state , thus preventing F - actin severing by cofilin I . Last , it stabilizes F - actin even under substoichiometric conditions , which are expect - ed during bacterial infection . In summary , our findings allow us to propose an integrated model of the coordinated interplay between SipC and SipA , S C I E N C E A D VA N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E Yuan et al . , Sci . Adv . 9 , eadj5777 ( 2023 ) 8 December 2023 7 of 14 which are sequentially secreted by the T3SS during the initial phase of host - pathogen interaction and manipulate the host cell actin cy - toskeleton to facilitate Salmonella invasion of the host cell ( Fig . 7 ) . The secretion of the intermediate substrate SipC results in its an - choring as part of the translocon in the plasma membrane of the host cell . The actin - binding domain located at the C - terminal end of SipC nucleates actin filaments . The subsequently translocated substrate SipA is proteolytically cleaved within the host cell , releas - ing an actin - binding domain ( 15 ) . This domain then binds to a spe - cific site on the actin filament , a binding interaction that is enhanced in the vicinity of the infection site by SipC binding . SipA binding leads to the stabilization of young actin filaments , which is necessary for the reorganization of the cellular actin network at the site of infection . This reorganization facilitates the uptake of bacterial cells into the host cell and the progression of bac - terial infection . Several human ABPs , such as filamin A , T - plastin , and cofilin I , often have the same or overlapping binding sites located between two adjacent actin subunits along one actin - strand ( Fig . 2D ) . However , the Salmonella effector SipA exploits a groove located between the two actin strands and extends to a neighboring binding pocket . These mutually exclusive binding sites ensure bac - teria an efficient infection strategy by influencing the cytoskeleton independently of host ABPs . Still , some host actin - binding proteins such as actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin are also required for efficient Salmonella entry by providing free G - actin for actin network assembly , which is further stabilized by SipA actin binding domain at Salmonella invasion sites ( 3 , 32 ) . The binding of SipA is accomplished by a central globular domain and a flanking C - terminal domain , both of which are responsible for the unique binding pattern . The combined activity of SipA and the translocon protein SipC leads to stabilization of actin filaments . In this way , they influence the infection process , likely by locally stabilizing actin filaments at the T3SS - mediated interaction and injection site to form local membrane protrusions . The fact that SipA primarily exerts its stabilizing effect on young actin filaments and even under substochiometric conditions under - scores a highly effective mechanism at the host - pathogen interface . Fig . 5 . SipC enhances SipA decoration of actin filaments and the extended arms contribute to F - actin stabilization . ( A ) The influence of SipCc on binding occu - pancy of SipA β on F - actin .

This could , in turn , lead to novel therapeutic approaches for treatment of Salmonella infections . METHODS Constructs , bacteria , and growth conditions The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in table S3 . All bacteria strains were grown in LB medium .

Constructs for expression of SipA variant proteins were generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis . For the expression of GST - tagged proteins in E . coli , the cDNA of human full - length α - actinin 4 was amplified from the NIH 3T3 cDNA library ( Invitrogen ) and inserted into the Sal I – Not sites of pGEX - 6P3 ( GE Healthcare ) . For the expression of SNAP - tagged human T - plastin the full - length cDNA was amplified from the B16 - F1 cDNA library and inserted between the Bam HI – Sal sites of pGEX - 6P1 - SNAP . Salmonella strains with mutations in sipA were generated by using pORTMAGE ( 34 ) . All expression constructs and Salmonella mutant strains were verified by DNA sequencing . Purification and labeling of proteins His - tagged proteins ( table S3 ) were expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) cells . The cultures were grown at 37°C with shaking until optical density at 600 nm ( OD 600 ) = 0 . 8 . Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl - β - D - thiogalactopyranoside to a final concen - tration of 0 . 2 mM and the cultures were further grown overnight at 18°C . Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 g for 15 min , then resuspended in buffer containing 50 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 300 mM NaCl , and 5 % ( v / v ) glycerol , and then lysed by ultrasoni - cation for 15 min ( QSONICA , part no . Q500 ; 5 - s on ; 30 - s off ; 50 % amplitude ) on ice . Insoluble material was removed by centrifuga - tion at 100 , 000 g for 30 min at 4°C . The cell lysate supernatant was passed through a Ni + 2 – nitrilotriacetic acid resin column ( QIAGEN ) , and protein was purified following the manufacturer ’ s instructions . His - tagged TEV protease was added to the eluted protein in a mass ratio of 1 : 100 and dialyzed against buffer contain - ing 50 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) and 150 mM NaCl at 4°C overnight . The sample was passed through Ni + 2 – nitrilotriacetic acid resin again to remove cleaved His - tag and TEV protease and then subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL column ( Cytiva ) . Fractions corresponding to A 280 absor - bance peaks were collected , concentrated to 3 to 5 mg / ml , aliquoted in 50 μl , flash - frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at − 80°C . GST - fusion proteins were expressed in E . coli host Rosetta 2 ( Novagen ) . Expression was induced with 0 . 75 mM isopropyl - β - D - thiogalactopyranoside at OD 600 = 0 . 8 at 21°C for 12 hours . The bac - teria were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by ultrasonication as above in lysis buffer containing 30 mM Hepes ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mM KCl , 2 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 5 % ( v / v ) glycerol , and benzonase ( 2 U / ml ; Merck Millipore ) . The proteins were sub - sequently purified from bacterial extracts by affinity chromatogra - phy using glutathione - conjugated agarose 4B ( Macherey - Nagel ) using standard procedures . The GST - tag was cleaved off using PreS - cission protease ( GE Healthcare ) , and the GST tag absorbed on fresh glutathione - conjugated agarose . The proteins in the flow through were further purified by size exclusion chromatography with HiLoad 26 / 600 Superdex 75 or 200 columns controlled by an Äkta Purifier System ( Cytiva ) . The purification of human EGFP - tagged cofilin has been described ( 19 , 35 ) . Ca 2 + - ATP actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle according to Spudich and Watt ( 36 ) , stored in G buffer [ 5 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and 0 . 2 mM ATP ] , and labeled on Cys374 with respective Atto maleimide dyes ( ATTO - TEC ) for TIRF microscopy assays or with N - ( 1 - pyrenyl ) - maleimide ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for F - actin depolymerization assays . SNAP - tagged constructs were labeled with either SNAP - Surface 488 or SNAP - Surface 549 following the protocol of the manufacturer ( New England Biolabs ) . Unbound dye was removed by 2 - ml Zeba desalting spin columns ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Dilution - induced actin depolymerization assays For actin depolymerization assays , 10 μM G - actin ( 50 % pyrene - labeled ) was polymerized in 1× KMEI [ 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , and 10 mM imidazole ( pH 7 . 0 ) ] at 4°C over - night . The resulting F - actin was prediluted to 0 . 8 μM in 1× KMEI Fig . 7 . Schemeofthepossiblecooperationmechanismbetween SipAand SipCinactinassemblyatthe Salmonella invasionsite .

SipA constructs were then diluted to various concentrations in 1× KMEI buffer in a volume of 175 μl and then transferred into untreated black flat - bottomed 96 - well mi - crotiter plates . Dilution - induced depolymerization of F - actin was initiated by injecting 25 μl of the F - actin solution into each well of the microtiter plate , followed by a two second mixing step . The decrease in pyrene fluorescence was monitored with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 400 nm for 30 min . The data were normalized to 100 % . Immunofluorescence microscopy HeLa cells ( American Type Culture Collection CCL - 2 ) were seeded onto eight - well chamber slides ( Ibidi , Germany ) in Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle ’ s medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and grown to 70 to 80 % confluency ( 5 % CO 2 at 37°C ) . Cells were infected for 15 min with derivatives from S . typhimurium SL1344 at a multiplicity of infection of 5 . Then , the cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate - buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature ( RT ) . After quenching with 100 mM NH 4 Cl , the cells were permeabilized for 30 min with permeabilization buffer ( 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 3 % bovine serum albumin , and 1× phos - phate - buffered saline ) . The samples were then stained for 1 hour at RT with mouse anti - HA antibodies ( 1 : 500 ; anti - HA . 11 epitope tag antibody , MMS - 101R , BioLegend , Germany ) , followed by washing and incubation with the secondary goat anti - mouse AF488 antibod - ies ( 1 : 500 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , Atto - 647N – conjugated phal - loidin ( 1 : 100 ; ATTO - TEC , Germany ) , and DAPI ( 4 0 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ; 1 : 1000 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) as indicated . Images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 spinning disc mi - croscope equipped with a 100× numerical aperture of 1 . 49 plan apo - chromat oil immersion objective , a Yokogawa CSU - W1 spinning disc unit , and an Andor iXon Ultra 888 electron multiplying charge - coupled device camera . Cosedimentation assay G - actin was prepared from chicken muscle ( 36 ) , with a final puri - fication step using HiLoad 16 / 600 Superdex 200 column equilibrat - ed with G - actin buffer . For cosedimentation assays , ABPs were first exchanged into buffer containing 25 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) and 2 mM DTT using a 10 - kDa molecular weight cutoff centrifugal con - centratorat 5000 g . G - actin was centrifuged at 150 , 000 g for 30 min to remove actin filaments or aggregates . For the actin polymerization assay , G - actin and the ABP were mixed at final concentrations of 10 and 50 μM , respectively , in actin polymerization buffer A [ 5 mM Tris / HCl buffer ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , and 0 . 05 mM MgCl 2 ] and incubated for 2 hours at RT , unless stated otherwise . Ultracen - trifugation at 150 , 000 g for 30 min was performed with an Optima MAX - XP ultracentrifuge to pellet F - actin , and the resulting pellet and supernatant fractions were brought to the same volume of SDS - sample buffer and analyzed by SDS – polyacrylamide gel elec - trophoresis ( PAGE ) . For the F - actin binding assay , G - actin was polymerized in F - actin binding buffer B [ 25 mM Tris / HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , and 1 mM DTT ] for 1 hour at RT . Poly - merized F - actin was obtained by ultracentrifugation at 150 , 000 g for 30 min . F - actin was resuspended in buffer B . Then , F - actin and the ABP were mixed and incubated at RT for 2 hours . Ultracentrifugation at 150 , 000 g for 30 min was performed to pellet F - actin , and the resulting fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Cryo - EM data acquisition and processing F - actin and ABP complexes were vitrified on Quantifoil 300 - or 200 - mesh 2 . 0 / 1 . 0 grids . Briefly , 4 μl of the sample was applied onto glow - discharged grids ( glow discharge conditions , negative ; 25 mA for 1 . 5 to 2 min ) . The grids were blotted for 3 to 5 s ( blot force , − 5 to 0 ; 100 % humidity ) and plunge - frozen in liquid ethane / propane mix using a Vitrobot Mark IV ( FEI ) . The vitrified specimens were imaged on an FEI Titan Krios operating at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan K3 camera running in counting mode and using Thermo Fisher Scientific EPU software . Movies were re - corded with a nominal magnification of ×105 , 000 , corresponding to a pixel size of 0 . 826 Å at the specimen level . Movies were recorded with a defocus range of 0 . 8 to 3 . 0 μm . For individual frames , an elec - tron dose of 1 . 4 e / A 2 was used . Corresponding to a cumulative elec - tron dose of 56 e / A 2 equally distributed over a 3 - s movie . Single - particle helical reconstruction was performed using Relion 3 . 1 ( 37 ) . Movies were motion - corrected using MotionCor2 ( 38 ) . The contrast transfer function ( CTF ) of the resulting micro - graphs was estimated using CTFFIND4 ( 39 ) . Particle picking was performed using cryolo 1 . 7 ( 40 ) . The helical segments were extract - ed into 512 × 512 boxes and subsequently binned by four and split into four datasets . A clean dataset was obtained by combining these four datasets after two - dimensional ( 2D ) classification . 3D classifi - cation and autorefinement with initial helical parameters of a helical rise of 27 . 3 Å and a helical twist of − 166 . 5° were performed with local searches of helical symmetry . The 3D classes that showed clear F - actin features were combined and used for further 3D autor - efinement . To improve the SipA density , a mask was generated around the SipA density and used for classification without align - ment . The class with the best EM density for SipA was then chosen for the final 3D autorefinement . Overall , gold - standard resolution ( Fourier shell correlation = 0 . 143 ) and local resolution were calcu - lated in Relion 3 . 1 . The statistics for data collection and processing are listed in table S4 . Model building and refinement Previously built models of F - actin [ Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) : 5ONV ] ( 41 ) and SipA ( PDB : 1Q5Z ) ( 17 ) were used as initial models . Models were built in ChimeraX 1 . 3 ( 42 ) , and interactive re - finement against the cryo - EM maps was performed with ISOLDE ( 43 ) . The resulting coordinate files were further refined with real - space refinement in Phenix ( 44 ) . Model validation was carried out using the MolProbity server ( 45 ) and EMRinger ( 46 ) . The parame - ters of the final models are described in table S4 . Preparation of lipid vesicles 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) in chloroform was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids . Unilamellar lipid vesicles composed of DOPC were prepared by extrusion using an Avanti Mini Extruder ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) . The solvent in stock solutions of DOPC was evaporated with a stream of dry nitrogen for 1 hour . The dried lipids were resuspended in unilamellar lipid vesicle buffer containing 20 mM Hepes , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 , and 5 mM β - mercaptoethanol ( pH 7 . 4 ) at a total lipid concentration of 2 mg / ml , then sonicated for 3 min using a tapered microtip S C I E N C E A D VA N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E Yuan et al . , Sci . Adv . 9 , eadj5777 ( 2023 ) 8 December 2023 11 of 14 creating a turbid suspension , and lastly extruded 15 times through a 100 - nm polycarbonate membrane ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) yielding small unilamellar vesicles . In vitro TIRF microscopy Glass coverslips were precleaned with 50°C warm , double - distilled H 2 O containing 2 % ( v / v ) Hellmanex III for 30 min and then rinsed with double - distilled H 2 O , followed by equivalent steps using 1 M KOH , 1 M HCl , and 70 % ethanol , respectively . Dried coverslips were subsequently treated with room air plasma using an expanded table - top plasma cleaner ( Harrick Plasma ) for 30 min . Two - channel TIRF flow chambers were prepared by attaching the cleaned coverslips to glass slides using three small stripes of double - sided tape . Before the experiments , the channels were first filled with 20 μl of the lipid vesicle solution to form supported lipid bilayers on the solid glass surface within 30 min and then rinsed twice with 1× KMEI buffer supplemented with 1 % bovine serum albumin . Reactions in TIRF assays contained 1 μM actin ( spiked with 15 to 20 % Atto488 , Atto550 , or Atto655 , respectively ) . Before the exper - iments , Ca 2 + - ATP - actin was converted to Mg 2 + - ATP - actin by addi - tion of 10× magnesium - exchange buffer [ 1 mM MgCl 2 and 10 mM EGTA ( pH 7 . 4 ) ] . Polymerization experiments were performed in TIRF buffer containing 10 mM imidazole , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 10 mM DTT , 15 mM glucose , catalase ( 20 μg / ml ) , glucose oxidase ( 100 μg / ml ) , and 0 . 5 % methyl - cellulose ( 4000 cP ) ( pH 7 . 4 ) . The TIRF microscopy assays were ini - tiated by addition of ATP – G - actin and by flushing the mixtures into prepared flow chambers . Images were captured with a Nikon Eclipse TI - E inverted microscope equipped with a CFI Apochromat TIRF 100× oil , numerical aperture of 1 . 49 objective using 488 - , 561 - , and 640 - nm laser lines at 5 - s intervals with exposure times of 70 ms by Ixon3 897 electron multiplying charge - coupled device cameras ( Andor ) for 15 to 20 min . The pixel size corresponded to 0 . 159 μm . The elongation rates of filaments were determined by manual tracking of growing barbed ends using ImageJ software ( 47 ) . At least 30 filaments were measured from three independent movies per condition for the experiments in the presence of SipA β and the actin control experiments . For comparison of nucleation efficacies , the average number of filaments was obtained by count - ing all actin filaments in an area of 50 μm by 50 μm for 300 s after initiation of the polymerization reaction in three independent movies per condition . Simultaneous measurement of actin polymerization and P i release in bulk assays Phosphate release assays were carried out by combining seeded pyrene actin polymerization assays with the EnzChek Phosphate Assay Kit ( Invitrogen ) to simultaneously monitor bulk actin poly - merization and release of P i . For the generation of seeds , 10 μM G - actin were first polymerized in 1× KMEI at 4°C overnight . To remove P i from ADP - F - actin , the filaments were subsequently cen - trifuged at 150 , 000 g at 4°C for 45 min , and the pellet was washed once with 1× KMEI , followed by resuspending the pellet in 1× KMEI yielding a 5 μM ADP – F - actin solution . Immediately before use , the F - actin solution was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min to generate the F - actin seeds . On the day of the experiment , Ca 2 + - ATP – G - actin was run over a HiLoad 26 / 600 Superdex 75 size exclusion chromatography column equilibrated in G - buffer devoid of ATP to remove potential P i impurities and unbound nu - cleotide , taking into account that spontaneous ATP hydrolysis of Ca 2 + - ATP – G - actin is slow . Ca 2 + - ATP – G - actin was then spiked with 1 % pyrene - labeled G - actin and diluted to 44 . 44 μM using ATP - free G - buffer . The pyrene – G - actin solution was then mixed at a ratio of 1 : 10 with 10× ME [ 5 mM EGTA ( pH 7 . 5 ) and 1 mM MgCl 2 ] and incubated for 2 min on ice , yielding a 40 μM Mg 2 + - ATP – G - actin solution . For each measurement , 13 . 33 μM SipA β or the same volume of SipA - storage buffer ( negative control ) , 266 . 67 μM 2 - amino - 6 - mercapto - 7 - methyl - purine ribo - side ( MESG ) , 1 U of purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( PNP ) , and 333 nM of freshly prepared F - actin seeds were diluted in 150 μl of 1 . 33× KMEI and transferred in untreated black flat - bottomed 96 - well microtiter plates with a transparent bottom . The mixture was incubated for 10 min at RT to reduced residual P i contaminations using the MESG / PNP reaction as a P i mop as suggested by the man - ufacturer ’ s protocol . The assembly reaction was initiated by injec - tion of 50 μl of Mg 2 + - ATP – G - actin solution into the protein mixture to reach a final concentration of 10 μM actin , 0 or 10 μM SipA β , 200 μM MESG , 1 U of PNP , 250 nM F - actin seeds in 1× KMEI by the automated dispenser of a Synergy 4 fluorescence mi - croplate reader ( BioTek ) . The increase in pyrene fluorescence was monitored with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emis - sion wavelength of 400 nm . P i release was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the P i sensor product MESG at 360 nm . Time courses of pyrene fluorescence and absorbance of the P i sensor product from individual experiments were first normalized by subtracting the minimal signal at the beginning of the experi - ment and dividing by the maximal signal at saturation . Apparent half - lives of P i release were then determined by fitting averaged data from four independent experiments by the monoexponential function in Origin 2021 software ( OriginLab ) A ð t Þ ¼ A � e (cid:0) ln ð 2 Þ t 1 = 2 � t þ y 0 where A ( t ) is the absorbance of the P i sensor product over time ( t ) , t 1 / 2 is the apparent half - life of the P i release , A is the amplitude , and y 0 is the offset of the exponential function . Statistical analysis Quantitative experiments were performed at least in triplicates except for cryo - EM datasets . Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 ( GraphPad , San Diego , CA ) and Origin 2021 software ( OriginLab ) . Statistical differences between the two groups were determined by the t test with the unpaired experimen - tal design of the two groups by the nonparametric Mann - Whitney test . Statistical differences were defined as * P ≤ 0 . 05 , * * P ≤ 0 . 01 , * * * P ≤ 0 . 001 , and ns ( not significant ) . Supplementary Materials This PDF file includes : Figs .
