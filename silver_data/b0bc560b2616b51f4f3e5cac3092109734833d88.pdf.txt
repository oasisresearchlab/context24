2406 Biophysical Journal Volume 85 October 2003 2406 – 2416 Sphingomyelin / Phosphatidylcholine / Cholesterol Phase Diagram : Boundaries and Composition of Lipid Rafts Rodrigo F . M . de Almeida , Aleksandre Fedorov , and Manuel Prieto Centro de Quı´mica - Fı´sica Molecular , Instituto Superior Te´cnico , Universidade Te´cnica de Lisboa , Lisbon , Portugal ABSTRACT The ternary system palmitoylsphingomyelin ( PSM ) / palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine ( POPC ) / cholesterol is used to model lipid rafts . The phase behavior of the three binary systems PSM / POPC , PSM / cholesterol , and POPC / cholesterol is ﬁrst experimentally determined . Phase coexistence boundaries are then determined for ternary mixtures at room temperature ( 23 8 C ) and the ternary phase diagram at that temperature is obtained . From the diagram at 23 8 C and the binary phase diagrams , a reasonable expectation is drawn for the ternary phase diagram at 37 8 C . Several photophysical methodologies are employed that do not involve detergent extraction , in addition to literature data ( e . g . , differential scanning calorimetry ) and thermodynamic rules . For the ternary phase diagrams , some tie - lines are calculated , including the one that contains the PSM / POPC / cholesterol 1 : 1 : 1 mixture , which is often used in model raft studies . The diagrams here described are used to rationalize literature results , some of them apparently discrepant , and to discuss lipid rafts within the framework of liquid - ordered / liquid - disordered phase coexistence . INTRODUCTION When the model for lipid rafts was proposed ( Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ) , there was already the awareness that the detergent resistant membranes ( DRM ) isolated from cells were probably liquid ordered ( lo ) domains , based on the fact that liposomes with resistance to Triton X - 100 ( TX100 ) solubilization are in ordered phases ( gel or solid ordered ( so ) and lo ) , whereas in the liquid disordered ( ld ) phase ( phospholipid ﬂuid phase ) they are solubilized ( Schroeder et al . , 1994 ) . An additional important result was that the resistance of proteins to solubilization correlated with the lipid phase of the membrane where the protein was inserted ( Schroeder et al . , 1994 , 1998 ) . In sum , not only lipid - lipid interactions sufﬁce to make a DRM , but also the insolubility of some proteins is probably conferred by the fact that they localize preferentially to ordered domains . On the other hand , it was known that the DRM isolated from membranes were enriched in ( glyco ) sphingolipids and cholesterol ( chol ) and depleted in phosphatidylcholines ( PC ) ( Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ) . The natural lipids with highest main transition temperature ( T m ) in membranes are ( glyco ) - sphingolipids , some of them having T m much higher than 37 8 C ( e . g . , cerebrosides ( Marsh , 1990 ) ) but in principle their abundance is too low to form stable gel domains . In fact , whereas natural PC have mostly unsaturated acyl chains , in the case of ( glyco ) sphingolipids there is a high abundance of very long and / or saturated chains ( Marsh , 1990 ) . These results led to the design of experiments involving model membranes with ( at least ) three components : a low T m lipid ( usually a PC ) , a high T m lipid ( a saturated PC or a sphingolipid ) , and chol ( e . g . , Silvius , 1992 ; Silvius et al . , 1996 ; Ahmed et al . , 1997 ; Xu and London , 2000 ) . The main conclusions from such experiments can be summarized as follows : from detergent independent methods , it is known that chol can promote phase separation between a low T m lipid and a high T m lipid at an intermediate temperature when the fraction of one lipid is too low to phase separate in the absence of chol . The results have been interpreted as separation of an ld and an lo phase , the ﬁrst one being rich in the low T m lipid and depleted in the high T m lipid and chol , and the opposite for the other phase . At very high chol concentrations , the bilayer tends to form a unique lo phase . Above T m of both lipids , phase separation can persist . The rationalization presented for these phenomena is a preferen - tial interaction of chol with ( mostly ) saturated lipids . This is supported by the fact that other sterols , which are unable to increase the order of the bilayer , antagonize phase separation at gel / ﬂuid coexistence conditions . Recently , more system - atic detergent extraction studies have revealed surprising results , namely that for many liposome compositions , solubilization is easier at 4 8 C than at 37 8 C and that some glycosphingolipids facilitate solubilization ( Sot et al . , 2002 ) . It should be kept in mind , though , that these results would have to be rationalized in the context of a quaternary phase diagram . Recent results from NMR spectroscopy and ca - lorimetric techniques suggest that TX100 can promote the formation of new or stabilize lo domains by segregating together with the ld major components ( Heerklotz , 2002 ) . Silvius et al . ( 1996 ) alerted to the fact that results on high T m lipid / low T m lipid / chol could be rationalized within a ternary phase diagram , but much of the recent information in the literature is still reported in a descriptive manner . Even for binary systems PC / chol , the most studied being 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycerophosphocholine ( DPPC ) / chol , there are several phase diagrams differing signiﬁcantly among themselves ( e . g . , Vist and Davis , 1990 ; Lentz et al . , 1980 ; McMullen and McElhaney , 1995 ) . This disagreement is probably related to the similarities of physical properties in the Submitted March 26 , 2003 , and accepted for publication June 19 , 2003 .

(cid:1) 2003 by the Biophysical Society 0006 - 3495 / 03 / 10 / 2406 / 11 $ 2 . 00 lo and ld phases , which makes it difﬁcult to differentiate between them ( London and Brown , 2000 ) . For instance , phase separation in 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycerophosphocholine ( DOPC ) / N - palmitoyl - D - sphingomyelin ( PSM ) / chol systems is difﬁcult to detect by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) because there is little height difference between the two phases , but the domains can be visible as differences in the packing density ( Yuan et al . , 2002 ) . Only with the addition of the ganglioside GM1 the visualization of domains as height differences was clear . The usual methods to study the phase behavior of two - component membranes are much more dif - ﬁcult to apply to the study of ternary membranes , especially when one of the components is cholesterol ( Silvius , 1992 ) . Recently , a ternary phase diagram was published for the system 1 , 2 - dilauroyl - sn - glycerophosphocholine / 1 , 2 - distea - royl - sn - glycerophosphocholine / chol based on information from microscopy and ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) ( Feigenson and Buboltz , 2001 ) . However , as mentioned by the authors , a more relevant system would be sphingomyelin ( SM ) / 1 - palmitoyl , 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycerophos - phocholine ( POPC ) / chol . The purpose of the present work is to describe the phase behavior of a typical DRM - containing lipid mixture used recurrently in the literature by methods that do not involve detergent extraction . In this way , ﬂuorescence techniques have been applied to mixtures of PSM , POPC , and chol in different proportions . Partial binary phase diagrams were determined for PSM / POPC ( so / ld phase separation ) , POPC / chol ( ld / lo phase separation ) , and PSM / chol ( ld / lo and so / lo phase separation ) . The ternary phase diagrams PSM / POPC / chol ( ld / lo , ld / so , lo / so , and ld / lo / so phase separation ) at room temperature ( 23 8 C ) and at 37 8 C ( physiological temp - erature ) were then obtained , and they were used to rationalize published data on these systems . In addition , the tie - lines obtained are particularly important because they give the composition and fraction of the coexisting ld / lo phases . The phase diagrams here obtained are the simplest models that explain the results obtained by us and others and that are , at the same time , thermodynamically consistent . It is also worth mentioning that the phase diagrams do not contain in - formation about phase domain size , shape , and dynamics . MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals POPC was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , AL ) . PSM , chol , and 5 - doxyl stearic acid ( 5 - NS ) were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( Steinheim , Germany ) . Diphenylhexatriene ( DPH ) and trans - parinaric acid ( t - PnA ) were obtained from Molecular Probes ( Leiden , The Netherlands ) . Liposome preparation Multilamellar vesicles ( MLV ) containing the appropriate lipids and DPH when used were prepared by standard procedures ( e . g . , Mateo et al . , 1993 ) . The suspension medium was sodium phosphate 10 mM , NaCl 150 mM , EDTA 0 . 1 mM buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) . The samples were kept overnight at 4 8 C and all the measurements started at the lower temperature , at which the demixing process is faster ( de Almeida et al . , 2002 ) . The heating rate was always below 0 . 2 8 C / min . t - PnA and 5 - NS were added from stock solutions ( ethanol and methanol , respectively ) to the MLV suspension . The samples were re - equilibrated by freeze - thaw cycles and incubation above T m ( Sklar et al . , 1977a ; Santos et al . , 1998 ; Yuann and Morse , 1999 ) . The samples were slowly brought to 4 8 C for 90 min and then slowly heated to the measurement temperature and incubated for 1 h . Measurements on random samples were repeated for longer incubation times and this did not affect the results . The probe / lipid ratios used were 1 / 200 for DPH and 1 / 500 for t - PnA . The quencher / lipid ratio was 1 / 25 ( based on a gel phase membrane / aqueous phase partition coefﬁcient K p ¼ 12 , 570 ( Wardlaw et al . , 1987 ) and for a total lipid concentration of 0 . 2 mM ) . PSM and POPC concentration in stock solutions were conﬁrmed by phosphorus analysis ( McClare , 1971 ) . Probe concentrations were de - termined spectrophotometrically using e ( t - PnA , 299 . 4 nm , ethanol ) ¼ 89 3 10 3 M (cid:1) 1 cm (cid:1) 1 ( Sklar et al . , 1977b ) and e ( DPH , 355 nm , chloroform ) ¼ 80 . 6 3 10 3 M (cid:1) 1 cm (cid:1) 1 ( Lentz , 1988 ) . Absorption and ﬂuorescence measurements and data analysis The instrumentation was the same as previously described ( de Almeida et al . , 2002 ) . The temperature ( 6 0 . 2 8 C within replicates ) was achieved by a Julabo F25 circulating water bath and was controlled with 0 . 1 8 C precision directly inside the cuvette with a Pt100 . For steady - state measurements with DPH , samples were excited at 358 nm and emission collected at 430 nm . For anisotropy measurements ( e . g . , Lakowicz , 1999 ) , 1 cm 3 0 . 4 cm cuvettes were used and for intensity ( as well as time - resolved ) measurements , 0 . 5 cm 3 0 . 5 cm cuvettes were used . For time - resolved measurements with DPH , excitation wavelength was 340 nm ( laser of 4 - dicyanomethylene - 2 - methyl - 6 - ( p - dimethylaminostyryl ) - 4 H - pyran ) and the emission was collected at 430 nm . For t - PnA , excitation and emission wavelengths were 303 nm ( laser of rhodamine 6G ) and 405 nm , respectively . For details on ﬂuorescence decay analysis , see , e . g . , de Almeida et al . ( 2002 ) . The lifetime - weighted quantum yield is deﬁned by ( Lakowicz , 1999 ) (cid:1) tt ¼ + i a i t i ( 1 ) and the mean or average ﬂuorescence lifetime is given by h t i ¼ + i a i t 2i (cid:1) (cid:2)(cid:3) + i a i t i (cid:1) (cid:2) ( 2 ) for a decay described by a sum of exponentials , where a i is the normalized pre - exponential and t i the lifetime of the decay component i . Two or three exponentials were required to describe DPH decays , whereas three or four were necessary for t - PnA . The lifetime and the fraction of light associated with each component are in very good agreement with the literature for DPH ( Lentz , 1988 ) and t - PnA ( Mateo et al . , 1993 ; Sklar et al . , 1977a ) . Phase coexistence boundaries determination Different methodologies were used for determining phase boundaries , which will be brieﬂy described . When there is phase separation into phase 1 and phase 2 , the probe distributes between the two phases , and the fraction of probe in phase i , P i , depends on the amount of each phase ( fraction X i ) and the partition coefﬁcient . In this situation , from the Weber’s law of additivity of anisotropy ( e . g . , Lakowicz , 1999 ) , the steady - state anisotropy of a probe in a lipidic system where phase separation occurs is given by h r i ¼ e 1 P 1 F 1 g 1 h r i 1 1 e 2 P 2 F 2 g 2 h r i 2 e 1 P 1 F 1 g 1 1 e 2 P 2 F 2 g 2 ; ( 3 ) Ternary Phase Diagram for Lipid Rafts 2407 Biophysical Journal 85 ( 4 ) 2406 – 2416 where e i is the molar absorption coefﬁcient , F i is the quantum yield , and g i is the ﬂuorescence intensity at the emission wavelength in a normalized spectrum for pure phase i . Usually , e 1 ¼ e 2 , and if there are no shifts in the emission , g 1 ¼ g 2 . If the partition coefﬁcient of the probe is close to 1 and the variation of quantum yield is negligible , then a linear relationship between h r i and X i is obtained . According to the lever rule , X i and the mole fraction of component j x j are linearly related ; thus , in the two - phase coexistence range , a representation of h r i versus x j should be a straight line . The probe DPH obeys ( in a reasonable degree ) the conditions necessary for that to hold . In the case of lifetime - weighted quantum yield , because of the proportionality to the ﬂuorescence quantum yield , the following relationship is valid , (cid:1) tt ¼ P 1 (cid:1) tt 1 1 P 2 (cid:1) tt 2 ; ( 4 ) for a probe distributed by two phases 1 and 2 . In the case of a partition coefﬁcient close to 1 , (cid:1) tt is linearly related to x j . This is the case for t - PnA distributed by ld / lo phases ( Mateo et al . , 1993 ) . In this way , h r i DPH and (cid:1) tt t - PnA can be used to detect ld / lo phase coexistence regions in a very direct and correct way . One further advantage is that both (cid:1) tt and h r i are independent of probe concentration , eliminating this source of uncertainty ( as compared , e . g . , with steady - state ﬂuorescence intensity ) . It is also important to note that both h r i and (cid:1) tt are sensitive only to the microenvironment of the probe ; thus they are independent of the domain size , in opposition to other methodologies , e . g . , FRET ( Loura et al . , 2001 ) . The variation of h r i DPH ( Lentz et al . , 1976a , 1976b ) ( and other linear probes , derived from DPH or PnA ( Sklar et al . , 1979 ) ) with temperature is a well - established method to determine phase diagrams ( gel / ﬂuid coexistence region ) of binary phospholipid membranes . In fact , the onset and completion of the lateral phase - separation are identiﬁed as breaks in the temperature dependence of a property characteristic of the lipid state ( Lentz et al . , 1976b ) . Nevertheless , due to particularities of the system under study , extra care was taken as described in the Results section , in a similar way to that described by Sklar et al . ( 1979 ) . The quenching of DPH ﬂuorescence by spin - labeled fatty acids can be used to study phase separation ( e . g . , Ahmed et al . , 1997 ; Xu and London , 2000 ) . The probe shows no preference for any of the phases , and the spin - labeled fatty acid ( in the present case , 5NS ) due to the bulky nitroxide moiety , partitions preferentially to the ﬂuid phase . In this way , when there is so / lo phase separation , the quenching of DPH ﬂuorescence by 5 - NS is less efﬁcient than when only one phase is present . Besides partitioning , there may also be an effect arising from interfaces ( 5 - NS may tend to accumulate in the defects between domains of the two phases ) . In the present study , the quenching was evaluated by I / I 0 or (cid:1) tt / (cid:1) tt 0 versus chol mole fraction , where I is the steady - state ﬂuorescence intensity and the index 0 means absence of quencher . It is expected that either I / I 0 or (cid:1) tt / (cid:1) tt 0 have an initial plateau , changing to higher values when phase separation occurs , and decreasing back to a lower level when a one - phase situation is reached again . In the present work , all the phase coexistence boundaries were determined from photophysical data ( ﬂuorescence anisotropy , lifetime , and quenching ) of two probes both with ﬂuorescence lifetimes in the nanosecond time range . In this way , there is internal consistence , i . e . , all the involved processes ( ﬂuorescence and anisotropy ) and interactions ( quench - ing ) happen during the probes lifetime , which is similar . Certainly that , when using other spectroscopic techniques such as resonance spectroscopies , different time ( and so length ) scales sampled by the probes are involved , and the boundaries will shift , although not in a critical way , from those here presented . Later in the manuscript , we will comment on the differences between published binary phase diagrams . RESULTS PSM / POPC binary system For PSM / POPC binary phospholipid mixtures , the method used to determine the phase diagram was the variation of h r i DPH with temperature ( Fig . 1 ) . In the case of pure POPC vesicles , with a main - transition temperature T m of ( (cid:1) 2 . 9 6 1 . 3 ) 8 C ( Koynova and Caffrey , 1998 ) , all the data shown correspond to the ld phase , and so it is clear that there is a signiﬁcant variation in the values of h r i DPH even for the same phase ( e . g . , at 3 8 C , h r i ; 0 . 20 , and at 60 8 C , h r i ; 0 . 05 ) . In the case of pure PSM vesicles , comparing the curve obtained with DSC thermograms ( typical peaks with maximum at ; 41 . 4 8 C ( Koynova and Caffrey , 1995 ; Marsh , 1990 ) and a width at half - height of no more than 4 8 C ( Maulik and Shipley , 1996 ; Epand and Moscarello , 1982 ) it can be seen that there is : i ) , a very good agreement between the calorimetric maximum and the midpoint of the transition detected by h r i DPH , validating this methodology , and ii ) , an artiﬁcial broadening of the transition ( in other words , near the T m , there is a gradual variation of h r i DPH with temperature ) . Comparing the curves for 100 and 75 mol % PSM , it can also be seen that the values , e . g . , at higher temperatures ( 100 % ﬂuid ) are composition dependent . All these effects were considered for the calculation of the PSM / POPC phase diagram . The correction of Mabrey and Sturtevant ( 1976 ) was applied to the mixed composition vesicles , allowing for a 1 . 8 8 C width for pure POPC ( Curatolo et al . , 1985 ) once that the two acyl chains are different . For PSM , a width of 3 . 1 8 C was considered once this is not strictly a pure component ( Maulik and Shipley , 1996 ) . The PSM / POPC phase diagram ( Fig . 2 ) is clearly one of a nonideal mixture , with a broad gel / ﬂuid phase separa - tion region , and due to the horizontal part of the solidus boundary , gel - gel phase separation must occur . There is also the suggestion of a ﬂuid - ﬂuid phase separation above the liquidus line in the region of high x PSM . For pure PSM , the data from Maulik and Shipley ( 1996 ) is presented ( the value for T m is the same as the one recovered from our data in Fig . 1 , but as described the width of the transition is much less ) .

Steady - state anisotropy of DPH ( h r i DPH ) as a function of temperature for MLV composed of 100 % PSM ( circles ) , 75 mol % PSM / 25 mol % POPC ( diamonds ) , and 100 % POPC ( squares ) . 2408 de Almeida et al . Biophysical Journal 85 ( 4 ) 2406 – 2416 PSM / chol binary system Above the T m of PSM , the lo / ld phase boundaries were determined from the variation of h r i DPH with x chol . A typical result is shown in Fig . 3 for PSM / chol lipid mixtures at 50 8 C . The three straight lines distinguish the three regimes : only ld phase for low chol mol fraction ( x chol ) ; ld / lo coexistence for intermediate x chol and only lo phase for high x chol . The ﬂuorescence decays of DPH in this system were also obtained . Interestingly , although the variation of the life - times was at most by a factor of 1 . 5 , preventing a good determination of the phase boundaries ( Fig . 3 C ) , the phase boundaries determined from the anisotropies ( Fig . 3 A ) coincide with special points in the trend of the amplitudes of the decay components ( Fig . 3 B ) . This is in further support to the phase boundaries from h r i data . The phase diagram for PSM / chol is presented in Fig . 4 . For bovine brain SM / chol , a partial phase diagram is re - ported above the T m of SM , with an ld / lo phase separation region ( Sankaram and Thompson , 1990 ) which compares well with the same region of the diagram presented here ( especially when taking the higher x chol in the error bars presented in that phase diagram ) . Below the T m of PSM , where the presence of cholesterol should induce the formation of an lo phase from an so phase ( Ipsen et al . , 1987 ; Ahmed et al . , 1997 ) , the addition of 50 mol % chol did not affect signiﬁcantly the anisotropy of DPH . Besides , the (cid:1) tt of both DPH and t - PnA suffered only minor changes . For DPH , this is not so surprising , but for t - PnA it is an unusual result . In fact , the long component of t - PnA , which can be considered as a ‘‘ﬁngerprint’’ for the so lipid phase , was practically the same in the absence and in the presence of 50 mol % cholesterol ( ; 35 – 40 ns at 18 8 C , a value typical of a DPPC gel ( Mateo et al . , 1993 ; Sklar et al . , 1977a ) ) . Nevertheless , the amplitude of the long component was below 5 % , and the (cid:1) tt values were typical of ﬂuid even in the absence of chol below the T m ( Mateo et al . , 1993 ; Sklar et al . , 1977a ) . These results , on one side , point to particularities in the structure and / or dynamics of the PSM lamellar phases , and on the other hand prevent the use of those ﬂuorescence parameters to determine the so / lo phase boundaries . These ﬂuorescence data can raise doubt about the formation of an lo phase . However , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) results show a decrease in the enthalpy of the transition with two regimes , and the enthalpy becomes zero for ; 42 – 50 mol % chol ( Maulik and Shipley , 1996 ; Calhoun and Shipley , 1979 ) . In addition , x - ray diffraction data show that the lamellar spacing increases with chol above T m and decreases below T m becoming the same at high x chol ( Maulik and Shipley , 1996 ) . All these are characteristic features of the formation of an lo phase . In fact , calorimetric FIGURE 2 Phase diagram for PSM / POPC MLV . Experimental data are shown as circles . The dotted line is hypothetical . The point for pure POPC is from Curatolo et al . ( 1985 ) . It is considered that there are one ld phase and two so phases ( so 1 rich in POPC and so 2 rich in PSM ) . FIGURE 3 Determination of ld / liquid ordered ( lo ) phase coexistence boundaries for the PSM / cholesterol ( chol ) lipid mixtures at 50 8 C determined from the h r i DPH ( A ) . The three straight lines distinguish the three regimes : only ld phase for low chol mol fraction ( x chol ) , ld / lo coexistence for intermediate x chol , and only lo phase for high x chol . The amplitudes of the ﬂuorescence decay components of DPH ( short component , diamonds : ( 0 . 4 6 0 . 1 ) ns ; intermediatecomponent , squares : ( 3 . 4 6 1 . 2 ) ns ; longcomponent , triangles : ( 9 . 6 6 1 . 4 ) ns ) are also shown ( B ) together with the phase boundaries determined from the anisotropy data . DPH mean ﬂuorescence lifetime versus chol mol fraction ( C ) is fairly constant . Ternary Phase Diagram for Lipid Rafts 2409 Biophysical Journal 85 ( 4 ) 2406 – 2416 data for PSM / chol displays the same qualitative features as the data for DPPC / chol ( Estep et al . , 1979 ) . Thus , it is expected that the phase diagram has the same shape for both these systems ( except for the fact that there seems to be no pretransition for PSM ( Maulik and Shipley , 1996 ; Barenholz et al . , 1976 ) ) . The so / lo phase boundaries at room temperature were determined using the quenching of DPH ﬂuorescence by 5 - NS as described under Materials and Methods . In the phase diagram for the system PSM / chol presented in Fig . 4 , the different regions are the same as in other phospholipid / chol phase diagrams ( binary monotectic sys - tems ) where the presence of the sterol induces the formation of a new ﬂuid phase , the lo phase ( Ipsen et al . , 1987 ) , but both the so / lo and the ld / lo phase coexistence regions are broader , i . e . , the composition of the lo phase boundary is located at higher x chol values . The point for pure PSM is the maximum of the DSC peak ( Marsh , 1990 ; Epand and Moscarello , 1982 ; Maulik and Shipley , 1996 ) , which corresponds to the midpoint of the transition detected by h r i DPH versus T ( see Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Another point ( x chol ¼ 0 . 26 ; T ¼ 36 8 C ) is the fraction of chol at which the two enthalpy regimes cross ( Maulik and Shipley , 1996 ) and the temperature to which the sharp peak decreases in the presence of chol ( Estep et al . , 1979 ) . This is taken as the point above and to the right of which there is no more so phase . The phase diagram presented here is also consistent with the appearance of a resolvable broad endotherm on DSC scans for x chol ; 0 . 10 ( Estep et al . , 1979 ) . POPC / chol binary system The ld / lo phase coexistence for the system POPC / chol was studied by means of h r i DPH and (cid:1) tt t - PnA versus x chol . No determinations were made below the T m of POPC , i . e . , so / lo phase boundaries . The results obtained from the two methodologies were essentially the same . The partial phase diagram is shown in Fig . 5 , where a broad ld / lo coexistence region can be observed . The phase diagram is similar to the previous published one ( Mateo et al . , 1993 ) , except that for the lower temperatures , the phase coexistence both begins and ends at slightly higher x chol values . PSM / POPC / chol ternary system To build the ternary phase diagram at 23 8 C , the follow - ing information was used : the binary tie - lines at 23 8 C ( and the expected ternary phase behavior from the binary phase diagrams ( Rhines , 1956 ) ) , thermodynamic principles ( the phase rule , and limitations to the two - phase / one - phase boundaries imposed by the Gibbs energy minimum principle ( Rhines , 1956 ) ) , and the phase behavior of similar systems ( Silvius et al . , 1996 ) . Furthermore , experimental data was obtained for ternary mixtures at 23 8 C out of the three - phase region ( tie - triangle , see below ) to avoid further complexity . For low x PSM ( ld / lo coexistence ) , h r i DPH was used , whereas for low x POPC ( so / lo coexistence ) , the methodology based on the quenching of DPH by 5 - NS was applied . At low x PSM ( ld / lo coexistence ) , the tie - lines should have a direction close to the direction of the left side of the diagram , and for low x POPC ( so / lo coexistence ) , their direction should be approximate to that of the right side of the diagram . Concomitantly , the mea - surements were performed at constant x PSM and x POPC , respectively . In this way , the determination of phase coexistence boundaries is performed approximately along a tie - line . An example is given in Fig . 6 , where quenching methodology results are presented . The ﬁnal diagram , drawn taking into consideration all the aspects mentioned above , is shown in Fig . 7 A . The main features of the diagram are a broad lo / ld phase coexistence region on the left side of the diagram ( high POPC / PSM ratio ) , a considerable so / lo phase FIGURE 4 PSM / chol phase diagram . The points shown were determined from h r i DPH ( circles ) , DPH quenching by 5 - NS ( squares ) , and literature ( diamonds , see text for details ) . Between the dotted lines is the regime of strong h r i DPH variation for pure PSM . FIGURE 5 POPC / chol phase diagram . The experimental points were determined from h r i DPH and t - PnA lifetime . 2410 de Almeida et al . Biophysical Journal 85 ( 4 ) 2406 – 2416 coexistence region and the presence of a tie - triangle , i . e . , a region of three - phase coexistence , where the composition of each phase is given by the position of each corner of the triangle and where the lever rule is valid . The sides of the tie - triangle can be considered tie - lines , once that the third phase is present only in an inﬁnitesimal amount . In Fig . 7 B , the phase diagram at 37 8 C is shown . The same data was used as for the diagram at 23 8 C , except that no experimental points were determined for ternary compositions . The boundaries at 37 8 C are very difﬁcult to determine , and one of the reasons is that h r i DPH is on the strongly temperature - dependent region of PSM transition , and so the meaning of the results is difﬁcult to assess . Nevertheless , it suggests an interesting behavior , as will be apparent in the Discussion section . The so / lo coexistence region is much smaller than at 23 8 C , and concomitantly the lo / ld ( the ‘‘raft region’’ ) is much broader . In Table 1 , the extremes of the tie - lines highlighted in Fig . 7 , A and B , are given . These points describe the rafts composition ( lo phase ) and also the ld composition . DISCUSSION PSM was chosen to represent the high - melting component for several reasons . First of all , an SM isolated from natural sources was ruled out due to the complex thermotropic behavior ( e . g . , Barenholz et al . , 1976 ) and acyl chain composition ( Marsh , 1990 ) . On another hand , C16 : 0 is one of the fatty acids that comprise the bulk of the fatty acid residues found in SM isolated from natural sources ( Estep et al . , 1979 ) . Finally , PSM has a simple thermotropic behavior , but nevertheless with a T m that is close to the T m of SM isolated from natural sources ( e . g . , bovine brain SM ( Barenholz et al . , 1976 ) ) . SM is the most abundant sphingolipid in many tissues and in some cases the predominant phospholipid ( e . g . , the phospholipids content of the outer leaﬂet of the intestinal brush border membrane is ; 75 % SM and ; 25 % PC ( Ve´nien and Le Grimellec , 1988 ) ) . POPC was chosen to represent the low - melting compo - nent because it is a 1 - saturated , 2 - unsaturated PC , a common motif found in naturally occurring phospholipids , being the major lipid component in PC isolated from several natural sources ( Marsh , 1990 ) . It has a low T m ( Marsh , 1990 ) , but it has the ability to form a lo phase in the presence of chol both below ( Thewalt and Bloom , 1992 ) and above ( Mateo et al . , 1993 ) T m , i . e . , so / lo and ld / lo phase coexistence , respec - tively . It is used in several studies in ternary ( or higher ) model systems ( e . g . , Silvius , 1992 ; Milhiet et al . , 2001 ; Dietrich et al . , 2001 ) . Recently , ld / lo phase separation in POPC / chol - oriented bilayers was detected by pulsed ﬁeld gradient NMR ( Lindblom et al . , 2003 ) . Regarding the PSM / POPC binary system ( Fig . 2 ) , there is an interesting feature : although the phase diagram is of the same kind of the DPPC / POPC mixture ( perithetic ) , PSM mixes with POPC in a way closer to ideal than DPPC ( Curatolo et al . , 1985 ) . Although chol can recognize and interact preferentially with SM in a laterally phase - separated system , it cannot do so when in a miscible bilayer system composed , e . g . , of PSM and DMPC ( Calhoun and Shipley , 1979 ) . Thus , it may be that the tendency of PSM and POPC to phase separate in the ﬂuid is relevant in this context . The phase coexistence boundaries at room temperature are in good agreement with SM / 12 - spin label - PC ( Ahmed et al . 1997 ) . Gandhavadi et al . ( 2002 ) found no phase separation for DOPC / bovine brain SM ( 7 : 3 ) at 20 8 C ; in the PSM / POPC diagram of Fig . 1 , this is very close to the liquidus line , there being no extensive phase separation . For the binary systems POPC / chol ( Fig . 5 ) and PSM / chol ( Fig . 4 ) , and many ternary compositions ( Fig . 7 ) , the x chol necessary to attain a single lo phase is much higher than in well - known phase diagrams like those for DPPC / chol ( Ipsen et al . , 1987 ; Sankaram and Thompson , 1991 ) and even DMPC / chol ( Mateo et al . , 1993 ; Almeida et al . , 1992 ) . The signiﬁcance of this result is that ld / lo phase separation is very likely to occur in cell membranes with 30 – 40 % chol . In case that the phase diagram was like , e . g . , DPPC / chol by Vist and Davis ( 1990 ) , then a single lo phase would be present . In agreement with phase separation persisting to higher x chol , DSC data for PC / chol and SM / chol show that the low enthalpy , low cooperativity transition endures up to x chol ; 0 . 50 almost independently of the system ( Maulik and Shipley , 1996 ; McIntosh et al . , 1992 ; McMullen et al . , 1993 ) . This has been interpreted as the ‘‘melting’’ of the chol - rich phase , i . e . , the lo / ld transition . To be consistent with that interpretation , it must be accepted that this kind of phase coexistence does persist up to that x chol , in agreement with Fig . 5 ( POPC / chol ) and Fig . 4 above T m ( PSM / chol ) . Further evidence was obtained from freeze - fracture micros - FIGURE 6 Determinationofso / lophasecoexistenceboundaries . Thelipid mixtures contain 15 mol % of POPC and varying proportions of PSM and chol , at 23 8 C . The method is based on the quenching of DPH ﬂuorescence by 5 - NS observed as a decrease in the lifetime of the ﬂuorophore . The dotted lines separate the high quenching efﬁciency ( one phase ( so for low x chol , lo for high x chol ) ) from the low quenching efﬁciency ( so / lo coexistence and segregation of probe and quencher , for intermediate x chol ) . Ternary Phase Diagram for Lipid Rafts 2411 Biophysical Journal 85 ( 4 ) 2406 – 2416 copy for DPPC / chol , e . g . , at ; 50 8 C , x chol ; 0 . 45 , that suggests the existence of two phases that , on account of other data , are both ﬂuid ( Lentz et al . , 1980 ) . Recently , the phase boundaries for DPPC / chol and bovine brain SM were determined by 13 C - NMR , and both systems had a similar behavior , with an lo / ld phase coexistence persisting up to ; 50 % chol at 45 8 C ( Guo et al . , 2002 ) . The results obtained with ternary lipid mixtures , summa - rized in the phase diagrams of Fig . 7 , are consistent with other literature works , namely detergent extraction data ( e . g . , Schroeder et al . , 1994 ; Gandhavadi et al . , 2002 ) and also AFM images , where phase separation can be undoubtedly observed for mixtures of bovine brain SM / POPC / chol ( 3 : 1 : 2 ) ( Milhiet et al . , 2001 ) and brain SM / DOPC / chol ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) with a predominance of the ordered domains ( Yuan et al . , 2002 ) . For this last system ( SM / DOPC ) , the presence of 10 mol % chol practically does not affect the monolayer topology , whereas it is strongly affected by 20 % chol . The phase diagram at 23 8 C ( Fig . 7 A ) resembles the diagram DPPC / 1 - dodecanoyl - 2 - ( 12 - bromododecanoyl ) - PC / chol at FIGURE 7 PSM / POPC / chol phase diagram at 23 8 C ( A ) and at 37 8 C ( B ) . The circles are experimental points . The red ( quasi ) tie - line on the tie - triangle describes the lo / ld composition at the right of which there is also so phase . The blue tie - lines are the interval for the possible tie - lines that contain the 1 : 1 : 1 composition . The purple point marks the 1 : 1 : 1 composition and the green point marks the 2 : 1 : 1 composi - tion . The phase boundaries for the diagram at 37 8 C are dashed lines to highlight the fact that no experimental determinations were performed for ternary mixtures at that temperature , due to technical limitations as described in the text . The dashed horizontal line for x chol ¼ 0 . 66 represents the choles - terol solubility limit on the lipid bilayer . The region above that line is of no interest for the present study because we are only interested in lamellar phases and it does not affect any of the conclusions . The value was chosen as the limit determined for several PC ( Huang et al . , 1999 ) at room tempera - ture , but it should be noted that the value can be different for a lipid mixture , i . e . , the line may not be horizontal , there can be temperature variations , and it was not determined for SM . 2412 de Almeida et al . Biophysical Journal 85 ( 4 ) 2406 – 2416 25 8 C ( Silvius et al . , 1996 ) . It is interesting to note that the authors also considered so / lo coexistence for DPPC / chol present until ; 38 % chol ( very near the value in the present study for PSM / chol ) to obtain a consistent phase diagram , although the system should be completely in the lo phase at a much smaller x chol , according to most of the published diagrams at the time . From the ternary phase diagrams , it can be concluded that in plasma membranes with a high amount of chol and predominance of sphingolipids and lo forming PC - like POPC , the whole membrane can exist as a unique lo phase . This supports a previous proposal by Brown and London ( 1997 ) . Also , according to those diagrams , at room tem - perature , for POPC / SM / chol ( 2 : 1 : 1 ) ( green point , Fig . 7 A ) there should be a considerable fraction of both ld and lo , but for a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio ( purple point , Fig . 7 A ) , the lo phase should predominate , in agreement with other studies ( Dietrich et al . , 2001 ; Yuan et al . , 2002 ) . In fact , the ‘‘raft mixtures’’ in the work by Dietrich et al . ( 2001 ) have molar ratios 2 : 1 : 1 for the system POPC / SM / chol and 1 : 1 : 1 for DOPC / SM / chol . This is probably due to the fact , as ex - plained below , that for the DOPC - containing system , the relative enrichment in SM when going from ld to lo along a tie - line is higher than for the POPC - containing systems , and the 1 : 1 : 1 composition should correspond to a more similar fraction of both phases , facilitating the domain visualization by the microscopy methods employed . In a recent AFM / DSC study , it was veriﬁed that SM / PC mixtures mimicking the outer leaﬂet of the brush border membrane displayed so / ld separation ( Milhiet et al . , 2002 ) . As chol was added , the topology of the domains was changed ( formation of lo domains ) , and eventually phase separation disappeared at high chol fractions . This behavior is what the diagrams in Fig . 7 predict . Usually three - phase coexistence areas are not observed , and there are many reasons for this , namely : i ) , one of the phases is present in a small amount ; ii ) , there are small differences on physical properties between them ; iii ) , the topology of the phases disguises one of them ( Samsonov et al . ( 2001 ) do not discard the hypothesis of small so domains within the larger lo domains ) ; iv ) , techniques sometimes do not distinguish ld from lo : e . g . , wide - angle x - ray patterns ( Gandhavadi et al . , 2002 ) ; and v ) , techniques that do not distinguish so from lo ( e . g . , the photophysical data of t - PnA and DPH here de - scribed for PSM / chol mixtures below T m ) . Such as mentioned above , the main problems for the determination of a precise phase diagram are related to the sensitivity of the techniques . Curves like , e . g . , h r i versus x chol ( Eq . 3 and Fig . 3 A ) can have very subtle slope changes , making it difﬁcult to determine precisely the beginning and ending of phase coexistence . Why in ﬂuorescence microscopy with ; 33 mol % chol , two phases are seen in , e . g . , DOPC / SM / chol ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) and not in , e . g . , the binary mixtures POPC / chol ( 2 : 1 ) ( Dietrich et al . , 2001 ) or DPPC / chol ( 2 : 1 ) by AFM ( Yuan and Johnston , 2001 ) ? In the ternary system , the compositional difference between lo and ld phases is greater , and the properties of the coexisting phases may be more distinct and this may also allow for larger domains ( in the optical microscopy experiment cited , 1 pixel corresponds to 80 nm ) . On another hand , the partition coefﬁcient of the probes between the ordered and disordered phase in the ternary system can be further away from unity improving the ability to distinguish two phases , when present . In the case of DPPC / chol , the ‘‘gel - like’’ phase , if present ( see , e . g . , phase diagram in ( Vist and Davis , 1990 ; Lentz et al . , 1980 ) , is in a too small amount to be detected . Thus , apart from the partition coefﬁcients reasoning , if lipid rafts are to be considered as more ordered domains in an ld matrix , then the rafts region on the phase diagrams of Fig . 7 should exclude the upper part of the ld / lo phase coexistence , where the lo phase is predominant ( and possibly includes a small portion of the tie - triangle , where the so phase represents only a very small fraction of the system , and the ld phase is predominant ) . In quenching experiments ( the quencher derivatized PC is the low - melting lipid ) , it is shown that x chol ¼ 0 . 33 promotes domain formation for a very large range of sphingolipid content at 37 8 C ( Ahmed et al . , 1997 ) . This type of behavior is predicted by the hypothetical phase diagram of Fig . 7 B ( except that phase separation occurs for 0 % SM because the low - melting lipid used , POPC , has the ability to display ld / lo phase separation in the presence of chol , as previously mentioned ) . Although the lines drawn inside the diagram may not reﬂect quantitatively with high accuracy the TABLE 1 Composition of conjugated ld / lo phases in ternary systems PC / SM / chol , at 23 8 C and 37 8 C ld lo T ( 8 C ) Tie - line x PC x SM x chol x PC x SM x chol 23 On tie - triangle 69 27 4 24 42 34 Containing 1 : 1 : 1 74 – 69 19 – 27 6 – 4 25 – 26 36 – 35 39 – 40 37 On tie - triangle 36 59 6 1 73 26 Containing 1 : 1 : 1 69 – 57 18 – 33 13 – 10 14 – 19 42 – 33 44 – 48 4 Containing 1 : 1 : 1 60 26 14 16 38 46 Containing 8 : 1 : 1 81 10 9 57 18 25 SM is PSM and PC is POPC . The compositions given are the extremes of the tie - lines depicted in Fig . 7 , A and B . At 4 8 C ( results from Schroeder et al . ( 1994 ) ) , PC is from bovine liver and SM is from bovine brain , and lo is taken as the TX100 insoluble fraction and ld as the soluble fraction of the initial liposomes . Ternary Phase Diagram for Lipid Rafts 2413 Biophysical Journal 85 ( 4 ) 2406 – 2416 compositions of the coexisting phases , the overall phase behavior should be quite similar to that depicted in Fig . 7 B . The directions of the tie - lines vary ‘‘fanwise’’ so that there is a gradual transition from the direction of one bounding tie - line to that of the other . No two tie - lines at the same temperature may ever cross . Beyond this , nothing can be said of their direction , except , of course , that they must connect liquidus to solidus . It is necessary , therefore , to determine the position and direction of the tie - lines by experiment and to indicate them on the ternary phase diagram ( Rhines , 1956 ) . It is common in the literature to ﬁnd experiments performed on the lipid molar composition 1 : 1 : 1 ( purple points , Fig . 7 ) . The tie - line that crosses that composition can be approximated to a parallel to the red tie - line , on one extreme , or parallel to the POPC / chol side of the triangle , on the other extreme . But this last one would cross the tie - triangle at 23 8 C , so this reduces the uncertainty of that tie - line , because at the most , the tie - line is tangent to the triangle on the 100 % ld vertex . This ‘‘conﬁdence interval’’ is depicted in Fig . 7 A and the compositions presented in Table 1 . The same calculations were performed with the hypothetical diagram for 37 8 C . In this case , both extreme directions were allowed , and the interval of compositions for ld and lo of lipid mixtures 1 : 1 : 1 is broader ( Fig . 7 B , Table 1 ) . The red quasi tie - line gives the compositions of the lipid mixtures for which PSM is most enriched but where there is a vanishing amount of so phase . When going from ld to lo along that line , the relative enrichment is higher for chol than for PSM . As shown in Table 1 , at 37 8 C the composition of the coexisting lo and ld phases are more similar in terms of SM content than at lower temperatures ( 23 8 C ) . In cell membranes , other factors ( e . g . , the presence of proteins and / or phospholipids that cannot form a lo phase alone with chol at that temperature , as discussed below for DOPC ) may increase the SM content of the rafts even at 37 8 C . Detergent extraction at 4 8 C has been widely used , but this methodology is not consensual , as in fact we are in presence of a quaternary system . In this way , it is relevant to confront DRM composition with the compositions of the phases obtained from the diagrams here presented . The composition of the detergent - resistant and soluble fractions of PC / SM / chol liposomes obtained by Schroeder et al . ( 1994 ) at 4 8 C is shown in Table 1 . Surprisingly , in the case of 1 : 1 : 1 liposomes , the compositions of these fractions are very similar to the lo and ld compositions taken from the diagram at 37 8 C . It should be stressed that the diagram at 4 8 C would be totally different , as concluded from the already noticeable differences between the diagrams obtained at 37 8 C and 23 8 C . It is then concluded that the detergent introduces a very strong perturbation , but by coincidence it reports a compo - sition close to the one at 37 8 C . When starting from a 8 : 1 : 1 ( PC : SM : chol ) mixture , a different composition is obtained for the detergent soluble / insoluble fractions , but the soluble fraction has almost the same composition as the starting mixture ( Table 1 ) , and the insoluble fraction represents a very minor portion , and a high degree of uncertainty is associated to the values ( Schroeder et al . , 1994 ) . The diagram at 37 8 C predicts that the 8 : 1 : 1 mixture should be completely on the ld phase , and according to the diagram at 23 8 C , only a very small amount should be in the lo phase , in agreement with detergent results . At 4 8 C , a POPC / PSM ( 8 : 1 ) contains ; 10 % of gel phase ( Fig . 2 ) . The behavior of other lipidic systems , used as rafts models , can also be rationalized in the context of phase diagrams like those of Fig . 7 . In the case of DOPC / brain SM / chol ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) , no so phase was present at 20 8 C , as detected by x - ray diffraction , and detergent extraction at 4 8 C with 1 % TX100 yields a DRM fraction with a composition very similar to the one in Table 1 ( for 37 8 C ) , but the soluble fraction is much poorer in SM ( \ 8 % ) and slightly richer in chol ( 19 . 6 % ) ( Gandhavadi et al . , 2002 ) . This is because DOPC does not form lo phase and consequently the solubility of chol in ld is higher , at the expense of SM . Thus , the conjugated ld / lo compositional difference should be more pronounced in DOPC than in POPC containing liposomes . It is possible that this qualitative difference justiﬁes the difﬁculty in observing raft - like domains in POPC - containing mixtures as compared to DOPC . In fact , if the compositional difference is less pronounced , it is also expected that the physical properties ( e . g . , bilayer thickness ) are also more similar , and namely the partition coefﬁcients of probes and their ﬂuorescence parameters are less well differentiated . Nevertheless , from our point of view , models containing POPC are biologically more relevant than those containing DOPC as the low melting lipid . It is worth mentioning that in many studies , egg PC is used , which is very rich in POPC ( Marsh , 1990 ) . Some other literature results may be explained by the coexistence of three phases . The quenching of DPH ﬂuorescence in liposomes PSM / doxyl - PC ( 1 : 1 ) is effective both above and below T m of PSM ( Kuikka et al . , 2001 ) . The introduction of 15 mol % chol decreases the extent of quenching , especially below T m , where a gel / ﬂuid phase separation occurs in the absence of chol ( Ahmed et al . , 1997 ) . Usually the decrease in quenching in this type of experiments is interpreted as the appearance of domains ( phase separation ) from a previously homogeneous system . In the case of the experiment by Kuikka et al . ( 2001 ) , once that phase separation already existed , this result is best interpreted if a coexistence of three phases is considered in the presence of chol , maximizing the segregation of probe and quencher . Another literature result that can be tentatively explained is the AFM study by Milhiet et al . ( 2001 ) . The decrease in height difference between ‘‘light’’ and ‘‘dark’’ domains in SM / POPC monolayers with increasing x chol can be interpreted as follows : initially ‘‘so / ld’’ phase separation occurs ; with the addition of chol , lo domains start to form , but there is persistence of so - like domains ; with the addition of a certain amount of chol , the so - like domains disappear , i . e . , the system is in the lo / ld phase coexistence region , with 2414 de Almeida et al . Biophysical Journal 85 ( 4 ) 2406 – 2416 a height difference smaller than for so / ld ; ﬁnally , with a sufﬁciently large fraction of chol , all the monolayer is in the lo phase ( no height differences ) . These changes are not along a tie - line , and thus the phase types and their respective compositions vary . Although several different techniques and distinct model systems have been employed with the purpose of modeling lipid rafts , which resulted in a signiﬁcant amount of data often difﬁcult to conciliate , many of the apparent contra - dictions between them seem to point , after all , to the same general behavior . It should be stressed that , as well as for binary , for ternary systems the determination of partition constants for probes ( e . g . , rafts markers ) should be made along a tie - line . Only along such a line the phase compositions are kept constant . At present , we are carrying out topological studies using FRET according to a methodology previously applied to binary systems ( Loura et al . , 2001 , 2000 ) and for which the knowledge of the tie - lines is required . The size of the domains for low lo fraction is very small , below optical resolution ( unpublished FRET data ) . In the context of rafts , they should also be considered , because several studies in cell membranes suggest that rafts , if present , may have size below optical resolution ( Anderson and Jacobson , 2002 ) . This highlights the complementarity and the importance of using different methodologies in the raft ﬁeld . In the near future , it will be interesting to confront the phase diagrams here presented with those obtained by different techniques and on different model systems , e . g . , microscopy ( Smith et al . , 2003 ) and ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy ( Kahya et al . , 2003 ) on giant unilamellar vesicles . It is shown here that if rafts in cell membranes are lo - like domains , these can have multiple compositions ( reﬂected in different size , topology , and dynamics ) . On other words , there is no ‘‘magical’’ raft mixture . The region of the diagram where rafts ( lo phase domains ) have a more deﬁned size , topology and dynamics can be narrowed down to a much less extensive region , but the composition of the coexisting phases is still given by the extreme of the tie - lines , and the phase diagrams will be always indispensable tools .
