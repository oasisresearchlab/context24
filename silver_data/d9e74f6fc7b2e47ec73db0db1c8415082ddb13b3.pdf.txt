R E V I E W FOCUS ON MEMBRANE DYNAMICS Bridging membrane and cytoskeleton dynamics in the secretory and endocytic pathways Mihaela Anitei and Bernard Hoflack Transport carriers regulate membrane flow between compartments of the secretory and endocytic pathways in eukaryotic cells . Carrier biogenesis is assisted by microtubules , actin filaments and their associated motors that link to membrane - associated coats , adaptors and accessory proteins . We summarize here how the biochemical properties of membranes inform their interactions with cytoskeletal regulators . We also discuss how the forces generated by the cytoskeleton and motor proteins alter the biophysical properties and the shape of membranes . The interplay between the cytoskeleton and membrane proteins ensures tight spatial and temporal control of carrier biogenesis , which is essential for cellular homeostasis . Microtubules and actin filaments ( F - actin ) have an intrinsic polarity that is decoded by molecular motors 1 – 3 . The cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins not only contribute to cell shape , but also position organelles within the cellular space and assist in bidirectional transport ( anterograde and retrograde ) between the compartments of the secretory pathway or the endocytic pathway . Pleomorphic transport carriers form on specific membrane microdomains of donor compartments where they sort selected cargos ( proteins and lipids ) . They then detach and move over variable distances towards the cell centre or the cell periphery . They finally fuse with their acceptor compartments to deliver their cargos 4 . Microtubules and F - actin , as well as the forces generated upon ATP hydrolysis by their motors , help to shape membranes during carrier biogenesis . The first stage of this process consists of introducing membrane curvature to overcome the membrane elastic resistance forces and cytosolic turgor pressure . The second stage is to generate a tubular bud about 50 – 100 nm in diameter and of variable length . Although spherical carriers predominantly mediate endocytosis , extensive tubulation occurs in mammalian cells during post - Golgi transport 5 or early endosomal sorting 6 , probably reflecting differences in the dynamics of these transport processes . In the third stage , the nascent buds or tubules undergo scission , resulting in the release of transport carriers . During these different stages , flat membranes undergo considerable changes in shape , going from moderate ( bud , spherical shape ) to high ( tubule , cylindrical shape ) curvature , with regions of positive or negative curvature . The membranes of organelles within the secretory and endocytic pathways have distinct protein and lipid compositions that impart distinct physical properties in terms of their rigidity or elasticity , curvature and tension . These physical properties can be modulated by membrane - associated actin meshworks and motor proteins . Whereas the physical properties of membranes determine the forces needed to generate a transport carrier , their biochemical properties determine the binding of specific machineries , such as nucleation factors and motors , needed to provide these forces . Changes in membrane composition , shape and tension must be integrated with the recruitment and activation of the various machineries controlling membrane dynamics , thereby ensuring the completion of each stage of carrier biogenesis and the progression towards the next one . In this review , we discuss the links between the cytoskeleton and cellular membranes or membrane - associated proteins in mediating the formation of transport carriers . Coat proteins in membrane bending A first step in carrier biogenesis is inducing membrane curvature at the future bud or tubule site . Coat proteins , such as clathrin or COPI , can induce or stabilize membrane curvature . Clathrin coats function with adaptor proteins ( AP complexes ) and accessory proteins that have ENTH / ANTH ( epsin / AP180 amino - terminal homology ) domains 7 , which penetrate the outer leaflet of membrane bilayers and induce membrane bending . The ARF1 ( ADP - ribosylation factor ) GTPase , which regulates the interaction of COPI and clathrin / AP - 1 coats in the secretory pathway , can also induce membrane curvature 8 . Coat assembly is , in part , dictated by the levels of various phosphatidylinositol phosphates ( PtdInsP ) in membrane microdomains 9 , 10 . In addition , COPI coats tend to assemble on liquid - disordered phases of synthetic membranes that are more fluid and deformable than the more rigid , liquid - ordered phases that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin 11 . COPI bending activity can also be tuned by membrane tension 11 . Membrane curvature can be driven in the absence of coat proteins by the compaction of glycosphingolipids , as seen during Shiga toxin endocytosis 12 , or by aggregation of membrane proteins including caveolin 13 and flotillin 14 .

All rights reserved FOCUS ON MEMBRANE DYNAMICS R E V I E W F - actin dynamics promote membrane deformation After the initial membrane deformation step , a tubular neck must be created , which might require additional forces provided by actin polymerization and motor proteins . Fluorescence - based real - time imaging and electron microscopy studies 15 , 16 have revealed the spatial and temporal recruitment of coat and adaptor proteins and actin in yeast 17 and mammalian cells 18 . In yeast , clathrin / AP - 2 coats are recruited to the endocytic site within the first 10 s , followed by a burst of actin polymerization ( ~ 20 s ) and the recruitment of proteins binding to curved membranes ( ~ 25 – 30 s ) . Severing factors induce actin depolymerization once a carrier with a diameter of ~ 100 nm has budded ( > 30 s ) 17 . During clathrin / AP - 2 - mediated endocytosis in yeast 17 and mammalian cells 16 , F - actin polymerizes towards membranes , as also observed for clathrin / AP - 1 - dependent post - Golgi transport reconstituted in vitro 19 ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Therefore , growing F - actin could push on membranes and provide part of the forces to create a tubular neck on nascent transport carriers . The rigidity and tension of cellular membranes varies according to cell type , the physiological state of the cell and the identity of the membrane , which influences the requirement for actin in generation of transport carriers . In yeast , endocytosis absolutely requires F - actin , whereas endocytosis in mammalian cells can occur in its absence . When membrane tension is artificially increased under conditions of osmotic swelling or membrane stretching , however , the clathrin / AP - 2 coat becomes insufficient for endocytic carrier maturation , and actin polymerization is then required for generation of clathrin - coated vesicles 20 , 21 . Furthermore , in polarized cells , the formation of basolateral endocytic carriers does not require actin - based forces , whereas generation of apical endocytic carriers , where membrane tension is twice that of basolateral membranes , does 20 , 22 . Actin - generated forces are also necessary to accommodate large cargo loads 23 . How are actin dynamics at membranes regulated ? Some membrane - associated factors directly link the endocytic machinery to F - actin dynamics .

HIP1R loss causes a stable association of F - actin with endocytic 25 and post - Golgi carriers 26 . At the plasma membrane , HIP1R may also stabilize actin - dependent clathrin plaques , structures that are larger and more stable than the classic coated pits 27 . At the Golgi , the severing factor cofilin controls actin dynamics on sorting microdomains and secretory cargo sorting 28 . More generally , F - actin polymerization at membranes is regulated by the ARP2 / 3 complex and formins , which form branched and linear F - actin , respectively 29 . ARP2 / 3 is activated by actin nucleation factors , which include the WASP family ( Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ) members WASP , N - WASP and WAVE ( WASP - family verprolin - homologous protein ) ; WHAMM ( WASP homologue associated with actin , membranes and microtubules ) ; JMY ( junction - mediating and regulatory protein ) ; and WASH ( N - WASP , WASP and SCAR homologue ) 30 , 31 . These nucleation factors localize to defined membrane microdomains , where they are activated by RhoGTPases , together with their effectors 30 . For example , WHAMM localizes on cis - Golgi 32 , WASH is found on early endosome subdomains 33 , 34 and lysosomes 35 , and N - WASP / WASP is detected on the Golgi , the plasma membrane 30 , 31 and endosomes 36 . In addition to ARP2 / 3 , members of the formin family have been implicated in membrane traffic . For example , Dia1 promotes actin polymerization on endosomes 37 , and hDia2C , together with the RhoD GTPase , regulates their transfer between microtubule and F - actin tracks as well as their motility and their alignment along actin cables 38 . Spire1 and ARP2 / 3 together with annexin A2 trigger actin polymerization required for transport from early endosomes to late endosomes 39 ( Fig . 2 ) . Similarly to HIP1R , actin nucleation factors can be recruited to membranes by coat components ( Fig . 1a , b ) .

The retromer subunits SNX1 and SNX2 , as well as FAM21 , bind WASH ( e ) .

In yeast , genetic interactions link the Eps15 - like clathrin accessory protein Pan1p and the yeast WASP homologue Las17p ( ref . 41 ) . At the Golgi , clathrin / AP - 1 coats recruit , probably at their edges , the WAVE / SCAR complex by means of interactions between clathrin heavy chains and CYFIP ( cytoplasmic fragile X mental retardation interacting protein , also known as Sra1 or PIR121 ) 19 . The early stages of coat - induced membrane bending and F - actin - based membrane tubulation must be tightly coordinated . In the secretory pathway , ARF1 activation on defined membrane microdomains is controlled by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) 42 and GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) 43 . On Golgi membranes , activated ARF1 recruits coat proteins and the RhoGTPases RAC1 and CDC42 ( ref . 44 ) which regulate F - actin polymerization . Furthermore , ArfGAPs interact with a variety of proteins including RhoGEFs 43 . Indeed , the ArfGAP GIT2 and the RhoGEF ARHGEF7 , usually found as a complex 44 , associate with clathrin / AP - 1 coats at the Golgi 45 . ARHGEF7 activates Rac1 which binds to the clathrin - interactor CYFIP / Sra / PIR121 , thus triggering WAVE / N - WASP - and ARP2 / 3 - dependent F - actin polymerization necessary to tubulate clathrin / AP - 1 - coated carriers 19 . ARF1 also controls , through its binding to the RhoGAP ARHGAP21 , CDC42 activation required for the ARP2 / 3 - dependent transport to the plasma membrane from the Golgi 46 . ARF1 activation also recruits ARP2 / 3 to COPI - coated Golgi membranes 47 . Together , these studies have demonstrated that the early steps in carrier biogenesis require spatial and temporal coordination between key trafficking components and the actin cytoskeleton . BAR domain proteins and actin polymerization in tubule elongation The burst of actin polymerization coupled to coat formation could create sufficient membrane curvature to recruit proteins that sense membrane shape . Among these are members of the BAR ( Bin – amphiphysin – Rvs ) domain - superfamily proteins ( BDPs ) .

In vitro , BDPs induce membrane curvature and tubulation of liposomes , with F - BARs inducing larger tubules ( 60 – 110 nm in diameter ) than N - BARs ( ~ 20 nm in diameter ) 48 , 49 . In vivo , BDPs might function during different stages of carrier biogenesis . The F - BAR domain protein FCHo1 / 2 initiates or stabilizes low membrane curvature and allows the subsequent binding of clathrin / AP - 2 coats at the plasma membrane 50 . Several other BDPs are recruited after the initial stage of carrier formation 15 , 18 , 48 , 51 , and , at the Golgi , the N - BAR Arfaptin1 / 2 is detected on tubules 52 . Thus , local deformations created by BDP binding could aid the binding of additional BDPs to propagate membrane tubulation by forming a scaffold around tubules . In addition to their roles in inducing or stabilizing curvature , many BDPs bind WASP family members and therefore can sustain F - actin polymerization required for tubule elongation 30 , 53 ( Fig . 1a , b ) . For example , the F - BAR protein Toca1 binds N - WASP in a CDC42 - dependent manner during endocytosis 54 . Furthermore , the F - BAR family proteins syndapin 55 , Toca1 ( ref . 56 ) and FBP17 ( ref . 57 ) can release N - WASP autoinhibition and amplify ARP2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization . Interestingly , Toca1 / 2 also indirectly binds the WAVE / SCAR complex 58 . On early endosomes , the BAR - domain - containing retromer subunits sorting nexin 1 ( SNX1 ) and SNX2 associate with FAM21 to recruit WASH on tubules during recycling to the Golgi 33 ( Fig . 2 ) .

Bending can be induced by coats , ARF GTPases , by the insertion of ENTH / ANTH domains in the outer membrane layer or by F - BAR proteins ( for example FCHo1 / 2 ) . Myosins can also deform membranes , probably pulling them along pre - existing actin filaments . These events increase membrane curvature and tension and lead to lipid sorting . Synthesis of conical lipids , for example diacylglycerol ( DAG ) may influence membrane curvature , as seen on Golgi membranes after phosphatidate phosphohydrolase ( PAP ) inhibition .

Modulation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels by PtdInsP - 5 - kinases ( PtdInsP - 5 - K ) 129 and phosphatases ( oculo - cerebro - renal syndrome of Lowe or OCRL ) 36 may activate actin polymerization . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 may also contribute to BDP binding to curved membranes . Coats may recruit factors that promote actin polymerization and myosins that provide forces for carrier elongation . Membrane tension may influence myosin function . Membrane - binding BDPs can sense and may further enhance membrane curvature and actin polymerization . Microtubule - associated motors can also provide forces for carrier elongation ( Golgi and endosomes ) . The local synthesis of conical lipids , for example LPA , may contribute to membrane curvature . Enzymes such as phospholipase A2 ( PLA2 ) 130 and lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase 3 ( LPAAT3 ) 127 modulate tubulation of Golgi carriers . ( c ) Membrane fission . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 can be hydrolysed by phospholipase C ( PLC ) to form DAG . Activated phospholipase D ( PLD ) catalyses PC to form PA . Both PA and DAG can induce negative curvature at the neck . On the Golgi , DAG can contribute to the recruitment of protein kinase D ( PKD ) , a regulator of scission . BDPs may protect PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 from hydrolysis and contribute to the recruitment of hydrolysing enzymes ( for example synaptojanin ) . Increased membrane curvature and tension and BDPs may recruit dynamin that constricts membranes and may sustain actin polymerization . Dynamin depolymerization renders the membrane unstable . Forces provided by F - actin and myosins , and by microtubule - based motors , further stretch the membrane . These factors may contribute to create a lipid phase separation and line tension , leading to membrane scission .

All rights reserved FOCUS ON MEMBRANE DYNAMICS R E V I E W Finally , BDPs could be used as platforms that recruit key components controlling the subsequent steps of carrier biogenesis , such as dynamin 48 or lipid - modifying enzymes 60 , 61 ( Fig . 1d ) . It is worth noting that BAR domains are also present in a few GEFs and GAPs , such as the ArfGAP ASAP1 ( ref . 43 ) , the RhoGEF Tuba 62 and the RhoGAP oligophrenin 63 . Thus , they could regulate the local activation / inactivation of ARF and RhoGTPases on tubular membranes . Alternatively , proteins with lipid - packing sensor domains recognizing curved membranes may regulate GTPase activities , as described for ArfGAP1 , which controls ARF1 activation along flat and curved membranes in order to regulate endoplasmic reticulum – Golgi transport 64 . Myosins , membrane deformation and carrier biogenesis From the above studies , it is clear that the force of actin polymerization can directly deform membranes . However , the actin - associated motor proteins , the myosins , also have critical roles in carrier biogenesis . Plus - end and minus - end directed myosins ( Class I , V , VI and perhaps II ) have been implicated in many transport steps 3 , as first described for the type 1 myosins Myo3p and Myo5p during endocytosis in yeast 65 . Myosin motors can be recruited to membrane microdomains by a variety of direct or indirect mechanisms 66 . Motors with pleckstrin homology domains associate with PtdInsP membrane domains 10 , as seen for myosin 1b ( ref . 67 ) or myosin VI ( re . 68 ) , which localize to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - rich regions in the plasma membrane . Myosins are also incorporated into scaffold complexes that interact with coats and their associated proteins . In this vein , the yeast COP - I subunit Ret2 binds the yeast class V Myo2p via the Ypt11 RabGTPase 69 . Additionally , Dab2 , which interacts with the AP - 2 adaptor , binds myosin VI during clathrin - mediated endocytosis 70 . These scaffold complexes can contain GTPases of the ARF ( ref . 44 ) and Rab ( ref . 71 ) families , which are activated at defined membrane microdomains and regulate coat binding and later stages of membrane traffic , respectively . Moreover , these GTPases can also control both the recruitment and the temporal activation of actin - based motors . For example , Rab11 and its effector , family interacting protein 2 ( FIP2 ) , recruit myosin Vb on recycling endosomes 72 . Similarly , the yeast Rab Ypt3 and PtdIns ( 4 ) P recruit Myo2p on Golgi membranes 73 . How do myosins shape membranes ? This issue is complicated by the alternative but non - exclusive models that have been proposed . One such model proposed that membrane - bound myosins moving on pre - existing F - actin can generate mechanical forces and pull membranes , as seen for the plus - end directed myosin 18A during post - Golgi carrier budding 74 ( Fig . 1c ) . The minus - end directed myosin VI may perform a similar role during endocytosis 68 or tubule formation on recycling endosomes 75 . Another model suggests that myosins can control the organization of new F - actin foci on organelles 76 . In this model , myosin 1b could modulate the ARP2 / 3 - dependent assembly of actin foci and promote the elongation of post - Golgi carrier membranes 77 ( Fig . 1c ) . Alternatively , these F - actin foci and their associated myosins may control the local membrane tension of donor organelles , thus modulating carrier biogenesis . A third model involves a role for myosins in sustaining the nucleation of new F - actin . In yeast , endocytic carrier formation requires not only the motor function of the type 1 Myo5p , but also the Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin nucleation role of its SH3 domain 78 , 79 . Mammalian myosin 1E also has an SH3 domain and it may perform a similar role on endocytic clathrin coats 80 . Ultrastructural studies suggest that , at least in yeast , myosins are detected along different regions of endocytic tubules . Two populations of Myo5p and actin have been described in the budding yeast , one localized at the neck and the other at the tip of elongated endocytic carriers 15 ( Fig . 1a ) . In fission yeast , the F - BAR proteins Cdc15p and Bzz1p also accumulate in two distinct regions on forming tubules where they respectively interact with type 1 Myo1p and Wsp1p , activating factors for ARP2 / 3 ( ref . 81 ) . Thus , actin nucleators and BDPs could generate two independent populations of actin filaments along tubules , possibly providing forces for elongation . An interesting possibility that remains to be demonstrated is that plus - end and minus - end directed myosins create opposite forces along F - actin during carrier formation . It is worth noting that several myosins act as mechano - sensors of membrane tension . For example , a myosin 1b splice isoform responds to small resisting loads ( < 2 pN ) by increasing the actin - attachment lifetime more than 75 - fold 82 . Similarly , the minus - end directed myosin VI can increase its F - actin binding properties at loads above about 2 pN ( ref . 83 ) . Thus , the mechano - sensing properties of such actin - based motors could overcome high membrane tensions to sustain and amplify membrane deformation and tubulation . Microtubule - sustained membrane tubulation Microtubules and their associated motor proteins function in concert with actin and myosins to promote membrane tubulation . This is perhaps exemplified by the number of membrane - bound molecules that interact with both F - actin and microtubules , including WASH ( ref . 33 ) and WHAMM ( ref . 32 ) , as well as the formin mDia1 which aligns microtubules and F - actin bundles 84 . Such proteins could aid the positioning of tubular carriers elongated by F - actin - dependent mechanisms on microtubule tracks and the subsequent interaction of membrane - bound kinesins or dyneins with stable microtubules . Thus , microtubules and their associated motors could control membrane tension , curvature and tubulation initiated by F - actin - dependent mechanisms . Details on how microtubule - based motors ( the plus - end directed kinesins of class 1 , 2 and 3 , and the minus - end directed dyneins ; Table 1 ) interact with membranes are now emerging . Their recruitment onto membranes involves PtdInsP , coats , SNXs , adaptors or GTPases and their effectors 10 , 85 . For example , UNC - 104 ( KIF1A ) binds PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane by means of its PH domain 86 and KIF16B binds PtdIns ( 3 ) P on early endosomes by means of its PX domain 87 . On the endoplasmic reticulum , the p150 Glued subunit of the dynein / dynactin complex binds the Sec23p subunit of the yeast COPII coat 88 . On the Golgi , dynein binds COPI - coated membranes in a CDC42 - dependent manner 89 . AP - 1 binds KIF13A during clathrin - dependent transport 90 . On early endosomes , the dynein / dynactin complex binds to the retromer subunits SNX5 and SNX6 to elongate tubules during recycling to the Golgi 91 , or to SNX4 and KIBRA for transport to recycling endosomes 92 ( Fig . 2 ) . In addition , ARF ( ref . 44 ) and RabGTPases 71 can control both motor recruitment and temporal activation . For example , Rab11 and its effector Rab11 - FIP2 recruit kinesin II on recycling endosomes 93 and Rab11 - FIP3 binds the dynein light chain 94 . On the Golgi , Rab6 and BicaudalD recruit the dynein / dynactin complex 95 and kinesin 1 ( ref . 96 ) . Microtubule motors assist in carrier biogenesis , with the exception of endocytic carriers . The mechanical forces generated by the plus - end directed kinesins or the minus - end directed dyneins bound to membranes and ‘sliding’ along stable microtubules could be sufficient to pull out membranes ( Figs 1b and 2 ) . Ten to twenty kinesin molecules provide sufficient force to pull tubes out of giant unilamellar vesicles 97 – 99 . 16 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 14 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2012 © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved FOCUS ON MEMBRANE DYNAMICS R E V I E W The elongation rate of post - Golgi carriers destined to the plasma membrane or to endosomes is consistent with kinesin velocity 100 , 101 . Microtubule - based motors probably assist in the late stages of carrier biogenesis in vivo . Kinesins are highly enriched at the tips but are also detected along the length of TGN - derived tubules in cells 100 and in vitro 98 . Evidence that microtubule growth and membrane - bound microtubule plus - end tracking proteins contribute to membrane elongation during carrier biogenesis is still lacking , but has been proposed for EB1 / STIM1 - dependent elongation of endoplasmic reticulum membranes 102 , 103 or CLIP - 170 - dependent melanosome capture 104 . Intriguingly , kinesins can select subsets of microtubule tracks marked by post - translation modifications 105 , and some myosins also exhibit a preference for distinct regions of the actin networks 106 . These findings indicate that specific motors may drive trafficking steps by selecting different populations of microtubules or actin filaments , as shown for exocytic vesicles exiting the Golgi on polyglutamylated tubulin / septin 2 tracks 107 . Membrane scission The dynamin GTPase is a key component of several membrane scission events , including clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and post - Golgi and endosomal transport 108 , 109 . Dynamin , assembling as a collar on tubular membranes , constricts the neck of nascent transport carriers and controls membrane scission in a GTP - dependent manner ( Fig . 1d ) . Dynamin depolymerization leads to membrane instability and spontaneous scission 110 , 111 . Dynamin interacts with several proteins regulating actin dynamics , including cortactin , which activates ARP2 / 3 at the plasma membrane and Golgi 112 , 113 ; WASH on endosomes 34 ; or BDPs binding N - WASP 114 ( Fig . 1d ) . In addition , dynamin can bind and organize F - actin bundles and promote their elongation by displacing the capping protein gelsolin 115 . Therefore , it is not yet clear how dynamin functions with F - actin to control scission . In yeast , which does not express dynamin , carrier scission requires forces provided by F - actin and possibly Myo5p ( ref . 116 ) recruited at the basis of elongating endocytic carriers 15 . In mammalian cells , Shiga toxin - induced membrane tubules undergo actin - triggered but spontaneous scission in the absence of dynamin 117 . The Rab6 effector myosin II can mediate scission of anterograde and retrograde Rab6 - positive tubules from the Golgi 118 ( Fig . 1d ) . These scission events may be based on membrane tension generated by forces produced by actin - based motors . Alternatively , a tug - of - war between motors moving in opposite directions along membrane tubules ( actin - based , microtubule - based , or both ) can provide such forces , as seen during endosome fission 119 . This tug - of - war between motors at the neck or along tubules would certainly create the most favourable physical conditions to create membrane tension . The number of motors recruited along tubules becomes important if one considers that forces generated by kinesins ( 5 – 9 pN ) , dyneins ( 1 – 1 . 5 pN ) and myosins ( 1 – 3 pN ) are different and that their processivities can be regulated by load 120 , that is , membrane tension . This tension could induce lipid phase separation , as seen on tubules derived from giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) , resulting in the formation of membrane domains with different diameters ( liquid - ordered phase domains have smaller diameters than liquid - disordered phase domains ) ( Fig . 1d ) . This phase separation creates a line tension at domain boundaries 121 , and additional tension applied to tubules may decrease the line energy permitting spontaneous scission at domain boundaries , as seen in artificial membrane systems 122 . This may explain how F - actin - induced membrane tension could lead to scission : by inducing membrane microdomain reorganization and increasing linear tension at domain boundaries 117 . Theoretical modelling of clathrin - dependent endocytosis in yeast also supports this notion 60 . Because dynamin oligomerizes on highly curved membranes ( < 50 nm ) under a high tension , dynamin could function in synergy with these physical mechanisms 123 . Additional studies are needed to understand how scission occurs in vivo and how dynamin function is integrated with motor - generated forces and changes in physical membrane properties . Membrane morphogenesis and mechanochemistry Membrane lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role during carrier biogen - esis , as the biochemical and structural properties of membranes directly inform associations with the membrane trafficking machinery ( Fig . 3 ) . During carrier budding and elongation , local synthesis of conical lipids ( lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) , phosphatidic acid ( PA ) and diacylglycerol ( DAG ) ) generates positive or negative curvature of membrane bilayers 124 . Opposite enzyme activities may regulate tubule elongation and scission , as reported for the lysophosphatidic acid - specific acyltransferase γ ( which produces PA from LPA ) and phospholipase A2 ( which produces LPA from PA ) during COPI - dependent transport 125 . Similar lipid modifica - tions may modulate Golgi membrane bending 126 and tubule formation during post - Golgi transport 127 . Concomitantly , membrane curvature may induce lipid sorting in tubular carriers , as seen in vitro 121 , 128 . Changes in membrane lipid composition are also implicated in membrane scission . During endocytosis in yeast , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 domains , which are normally protected by coats and BDPs , could become exposed by membrane tension 60 . Any resulting PtdInsP - turnover would create a lipid phase separation and line tension that would aid tubule scission 60 . Moreover , BDPs could directly recruit and / or modulate the activity of PtdInsP - modifying enzymes on tubules . Recently , cell - free assays with liposomes and in vivo studies indicated that Synaptojanin 1 , a PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phosphatase , is recruited by the BDP endophilin on endocytic tubules where it may remove accessible PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and cooperate with dynamin to achieve membrane scission 61 . Conclusions The question of how membranes are shaped during carrier biogenesis has been studied at the intersection of two central fields of cell biology : membrane dynamics and the cytoskeleton . These studies have uncovered key mediators of carrier biogenesis and have provided mechanistic insight into how these proteins interact with each other or with membranes . Single - molecule analyses have also illustrated how motors change their processivity or affinity for tracks in response to load . The effect of changing biochemical and physical membrane properties on carrier formation is also now being elucidated . Despite these advances , many questions remain unresolved . Answers will come from approaches combining cell biology , biophysics , mathematical modelling and theory . Recapitulating carrier biogenesis with synthetic biology , which represents a technical challenge , can help tremendously in dissecting these complex protein – protein and protein – lipid interactions in space and time . These approaches may reveal how actin and microtubule - based motors cooperate with scaffolds that mediate the formation of mature carriers . Such combinations of forces certainly need to take into account the membrane tension controlled by actin - based meshworks associated with the donor compartments , NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 14 | NUMBER 1 | JANUARY 2012 17 © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

It will also be important to understand the precise mechanochemistry of vesicular transport . How organelles connected by bidirectional vesicular transport maintain and coordinate the physical properties of their membranes remains to be explored . Such answers , among others , may finally tell us how the biochemical and biophysical properties of membranes , together with cytoskeleton - based machineries regulate the coordinated flow of membranes within the secretory and the endocytic pathways . Monogenetic diseases , including Huntington’s disease , Charcot – Marie – Tooth disease , faciogenital dysplasia , mental retardation and Lowe syndrome , have highlighted the physiological relevance of coordinating membrane and cytoskeletal dynamics . Certainly , developmental biology and molecular medicine will contribute to further dissect the physiological importance of the biological and physical principles bridging membrane and cytoskeleton dynamics .
