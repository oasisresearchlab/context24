We previously demonstrated that reversible , non - degradative ubiquitination regulates the function of the actin polymerase VASP in developing neurons . However , the un - derlying mechanism of how ubiquitination impacts VASP ac - tivity was unknown . Here we show that mimicking multi - monoubiquitination of VASP at K240 and K286 negatively regulates VASP interactions with actin . Using in vitro bio - chemical assays , we demonstrate the reduced ability of multi - monoubiquitinated VASP to bind , bundle , and elongate actin ﬁl - aments . However , multi - monoubiquitinated VASP maintained the ability to bind and protect barbed ends from capping pro - tein . Lastly , we demonstrate the introduction of recombinant multi - monoubiquitinated VASP protein altered cell spreading morphology . Collectively , these results suggest a mechanism in which ubiquitination controls VASP - mediated actin dynamics . actin | VASP | ubiquitination Correspondence : sgupton @ email . unc . edu Introduction The dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton regu - lates many aspects of cell biology , including cell division , morphology , motility , and endocytic trafﬁcking . Starting from single monomers , actin polymerizes into ﬁlaments that interact with a myriad actin regulatory proteins to form a variety of different cytoskeletal architectures ( Pollard and Cooper , 2009 ) . Local actin reorganization , polymerization , and depolymerization are dependent upon spatiotemporal regulation by these different proteins . Amidst the abundance of actin regulatory proteins , the Ena / VASP protein family ( Mena , VASP , and EVL ) occupies a specialized niche ( Krause et al . , 2003 ; Bear and Gertler , 2009 ) . The tetrameric Ena / VASP proteins bind and bundle parallel actin ﬁlaments . They also bind to actin monomers and the fast growing “barbed” ends of actin ﬁlaments , where they enhance the addition of monomers and protect the barbed end from capping protein , which terminates actin polymerization ( Faix and Rottner , 2022 ; Krause et al . , 2003 ) . The combination of these functions position Ena / VASP proteins as multi - faceted regulators of ﬁlopodia—ﬁnger - like bundled actin - rich protrusions that extend from the cell periphery . Although their precise function varies by cell type , ﬁlopodia are considered sensors that explore the local environment , inﬂuencing cell migration and morphology changes ( Gupton and Gertler , 2010 ; Jacquemet et al . , 2015 ) . For example , developing murine cortical neurons require Ena / VASP proteins for ﬁlopodia formation and subsequent neurite initiation ( Dent et al . , 2007 ; Kwiatkowski et al . , 2007 ) . Impairment of Ena / VASP activity after neurite initia - tion disrupts growth cone ﬁlopodia formation and response to guidance cues ( Lebrand et al . , 2004 ) . Lastly , VASP and EVL play a role in dendritic ﬁlopodia and dendritic spine formation ( Lin et al . , 2010 ; Parker et al . , 2023 ) . Previously , we identiﬁed the brain - enriched E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM9 as an interaction partner of VASP ( Menon et al . , 2015 , 2021 ) . VASP and TRIM9 colocalized at the tips of growth cone ﬁlopodia in developing neurons , suggesting TRIM9 also regulates these structures . Loss of Trim9 increased ﬁlopodia number and stability in the growth cone and impaired axon pathﬁnding . We also showed that TRIM9 was required for the non - degradative ubiquitination of VASP in neurons ( Menon et al . , 2015 ) . Interestingly , this was a reversible modiﬁcation ; addition of the guidance cue netrin - 1 resulted in VASP deubiquiti - nation and a consequential increase in ﬁlopodia stability and number . Furthermore , experiments utilizing ubiquitin mutant constructs incapable of ubiquitin chain formation suggested VASP was mono - or multi - monoubiquitinated , as opposed to polyubiquitinated ( Boyer et al . , 2020 ) . Although K48 - linked ubiquitination is associated with proteasomal degradation , monoubiquitination is appreciated to regulate protein localization and activity ( Baker et al . , 2013 ; Lin et al . , 2016 ; Nakagawa and Nakayama , 2015 ) . As VASP ubiquitination reduced ﬁlopodial stability , we hypothesized that mono or multi - monoubiquitination negatively regulated VASP activity . In this study , we investigate the mechanistic impact of ubiq - uitination on VASP function . We identiﬁed two promi - nent ubiquitination sites within VASP . Through biochemi - McCormick et al . | bioR χ iv | July 16 , 2023 | 1 – 20 modiﬁcation of a protein with ubiquitin , an 8 kDa protein , cannot be mimicked with a single amino acid substitution . Instead , we utilized a chemical ubiquitination approach , in which a modiﬁed recombinant ubiquitin ( Ubiquitin1 - 74 , G75C ) was covalently conjugated to available cysteine residues on VASP ( Fig 1C ) . Three endogenous cysteines are present in human VASP , requiring their modiﬁcation to speciﬁcally ubiquitinate residues of interest . Fortuitously , a cysteine - light version of VASP ( VASPCCC - SSA ) was pre - viously generated and shown to have identical actin binding and elongation activity to unmodiﬁed VASP ( Hansen and Mullins , 2010 ) . Previously , we showed VASP was monoubiquitinated or multi - monoubiquitinated ( Boyer et al . , 2020 ) . As phospho - rylation of VASP at Ser157 causes a disproportionally large apparent molecular weight shift ( 4kDa ) ( Smolenski et al . , 1998 ) , we could not interpret the apparent molecular weight shift observed for VASP - Ub by SDS - PAGE as mono or multi - monoubiquitination . Therefore , we created two con - structs with single cysteine mutations—VASP K240C and VASP K286C—within the cysteine - light VASP background construct to mimic two versions of monoubiquitinated VASP ( mUb - K240 and mUb - K286 ) . We also created a double cysteine mutant VASP K240C , K286C to mimic a multi - monoubiquitinated version of VASP protein ( mmUb - K240 / K286 ) ( Fig 1D ) . With each of these recombinant proteins , we achieved over 90 % modiﬁcation with ubiquitin after chemical crosslinking . Following successful chemical ubiquitination , we used the bacterial sortase enzyme to conjugate a ﬂuorophore labeled peptide , TAMRA - PEG6 - LPETGG , to a poly - glycine motif added at the N - terminus of VASP . VASP - Ub does not disrupt tetramerization The COOH - terminal end of VASP contains an essential tetramerization domain ( Fig 1B ) . Studies manipulating oligomerization demonstrated Ena / VASP oligomer number directly correlated with the actin elongation rate in vitro ( Brühmann et al . , 2017 ) and ﬁlopodia formation in cultured cells ( Harker et al . , 2019 ) . As VASP - Ub was associated with impaired ﬁlopodia number and stability in cultured neurons , we hypothesized ubiquitination may impair VASP tetramerization and , subsequently , VASP activity . We performed mass photometry to quantify the molecular mass of VASP . As a monomer of TAMRA - VASP is 41 . 3 kD a , the estimated tetrameric mass is 123 . 9 kDa . We detected a single peak corresponding to a tetramer for unmodiﬁed VASP centered around 141 kDa . A similar single population was observed for mUb - K240 VASP , mUb - K286 VASP , and mmUb - K240 / K286 VASP ( Fig 1E ) . No signiﬁcant peak shifts were observed beyond the margin of error . Thus , mUb - K240 , mUb - K286 , and mmUb - K240 / K286 VASP each maintain tetramerization . mmUb - K240 / K286 VASP exhibits decreased actin cal reconstitutions , we demonstrate that mimicking multi - monoubiquitination of VASP reduces actin ﬁlament bind - ing and bundling . Furthermore , both mono - and multi - monoubiquitination diminishes the ability of VASP to en - hance actin ﬁlament elongation . Our results suggest that ubiquitinated VASP maintains barbed end association but is unable to efﬁciently add new actin monomers to the ﬁlament . In murine embryonic ﬁbroblasts , electroporation of multi - monoubiquitinated VASP alters cell spreading morphology and decreases localization to the lamellipodia and ﬁlopodial tip . Collectively , our ﬁndings mechanistically describe the negative regulation of VASP activity by reversible mono - and multi - monoubiquitination . Results Identiﬁcation of ubiquitinated lysine residues on VASP We previously demonstrated that non - degradative ubiqui - tination of VASP impacted ﬁlopodial dynamics and axon guidance ( Menon et al . , 2015 ) . Subsequent studies indicated that VASP was likely mono - or multi - monoubiquitinated ( Boyer et al . , 2020 ) . However , the mechanistic consequence of VASP ubiquitination—and how this impacted ﬁlopodial dynamics—is unknown . Consistent with neurons , VASP ubiquitination in HEK293 cells was dependent upon the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM9 ( Menon et al . , 2015 ) . To determine which residues on VASP were ubiquitinated , we immunoprecipitated exogenous Myc - VASP from HEK293 cells under denaturing conditions . Following separation by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting , we observed two identiﬁ - able VASP bands : a prominent , unmodiﬁed VASP band at approximately 65 kD , and a higher molecular weight VASP band ( 75 kD ) that comigrated with ubiquitin , indicating this was ubiquitinated VASP ( VASP - Ub , Fig 1A ) . This shift in molecular weight and relative ratio of unmodiﬁed and ubiquitinated VASP is similar to what we have previously observed with Myc - VASP in HEK293 cells and endogenous VASP in murine cortical neurons ( Menon et al . , 2015 ; Boyer et al . , 2020 ) . Immunoprecipitated VASP was separated on a SDS - PAGE gel and excised for analysis by mass spectrometry . Follow - ing enzymatic digestion and analysis , we identiﬁed numer - ous lysine residues as ubiquitination sites on VASP by unbi - ased mass spectrometry and conﬁrmed by targeted analysis ( Fig 1B ) . Of multiple lysine residues identiﬁed , three ubiqui - tination sites replicated across independent experiments and different enzymatic digestions . From these three sites , we selected the two most abundant ubiquitination sites , K240 and K286 , for investigation ( Fig S1 ) . K240 is located within the monomeric actin binding domain ( GAB ) of VASP and K286 is located near to the ﬁlamentous actin binding domain ( FAB ) . Generation of puriﬁed , ubiquitinated VASP mimics To investigate how ubiquitination at these sites altered protein function , we puriﬁed and ubiquitinated recombinant human VASP in vitro . Unlike phosphorylation or acetylation , 2 | bioR χ iv McCormick et al . | Ubiquitination negatively regulates VASP activity Fig . 1 . VASP is ubiquitinated at K240 and K286 .

These graphs show one representative trace for each construct ( N = 2 ) . ﬁlament binding and bundling With puriﬁed , ubiquitinated VASP tetramers in hand , we began testing the ability of VASP - Ub to bind actin ﬁlaments through high speed co - sedimentation assays ( Fig 2A ) . At this centrifugation speed , actin ﬁlaments—and any ﬁlamentous binding partners—are pelleted . Consistent with previous results ( Reinhard et al . , 1992 ; Breitsprecher et al . , 2011 ) , the majority of unmodiﬁed VASP co - sedimented with actin ﬁlaments ( Fig 2B , C ) . A single ubiquitination modiﬁcation at K286 ( mUb - K286 ) did not signiﬁcantly change the amount of VASP present in the pellet , however , a small but signiﬁcant decrease was observed with 600 nM of mUb - 240 . Furthermore , there was a signiﬁcant decrease in the amount of mmUb - K240 / K286 that co - sedimented with actin at 400 nM and 600nM ( Fig 2C ) . This suggests that VASP multi - monoubiquitination decreased ﬁlamentous actin binding afﬁnity . VASP also promotes actin ﬁlament bundling . We completed similar assays at low centrifugation speeds to evaluate the ability of VASP to promote bundling of actin ﬁlaments ( Fig 2D ) . Compared to actin alone , unmodiﬁed VASP increased bundled actin in a concentration dependent manner ( Fig 2E , F ) . We observed similar actin bundling activity in the presence of mUb - K240 and mUb - K286 . A decrease in actin bundling activity by mmUb - K240 / K286 at lower concentra - tions was apparent , although this change was only signiﬁcant at 400 nM . By 600nM—a concentration at which the actin bundling activity of unmodiﬁed VASP was saturated—the bundling activity of mmUb - K240 / K286 recovered ( Fig 2E , F ) . mmUb - K240 / K286 VASP exhibits impaired ability to accelerate actin ﬁlament elongation The acceleration of actin ﬁlament elongation by VASP requires two separate actin binding events . First , VASP McCormick et al . | Ubiquitination negatively regulates VASP activity bioR χ iv | 3 Fig . 2 . Multi - monoubiquitination of VASP impairs actin bundling and binding .

Unmodiﬁed VASP v . mUb - K240 / K286 : 200 nM = 0 . 06399 , 400 nM = 0 . 0399 . must bind to the growing “barbed” end of the actin ﬁla - ment through the FAB ( ﬁlamentous actin binding domain ) . Secondly , VASP binds monomeric actin through the GAB ( G - actin binding domain ) . This presence of four GAB domains—each able to bind an actin monomer—is thought to increase the local pool of monomeric actin available for polymerization at the barbed end , accelerating elongation ( Hansen and Mullins , 2010 ) . Due to the proximity of the identiﬁed ubiquitination sites to the GAB ( K240 - Ub ) and the FAB ( K286 - Ub ) , we hypothesized that ubiquitinated VASP may also exhibit a deﬁcit in ﬁlament elongation . We used seeded pyrene assays—in which labeled actin monomers were added to pre - formed actin ﬁlaments—to speciﬁcally examine the elongation step of actin polymerization ( Fig 3A ) . We analyzed the ﬁrst 300 s of the assay to determine the initial elongation rate at range of VASP concentrations ( Fig 3B ) . Consistent with previous studies ( Harker et al . , 2019 ) , unmodiﬁed VASP displayed a concentration - dependent increase in the rate of actin elongation before reaching a plateau . mUb - K240 or mUb - K286 did not signiﬁcantly change the plateaued maximal actin elongation rate . We also estimated similar K D values as unmodiﬁed VASP for both modiﬁcations ( Table 1 ) , suggesting the afﬁnity of VASP for the barbed end of the actin ﬁlament was not detectably altered by either monoubiquitination event . Strikingly , the cumulative effect of both monoubiquitins in mmUb - K240 / K286 severely reduced the rate of actin elongation , with the values remaining close to actin alone . Although actin elongation was impaired by multimonoubiquitination , results from this bulk assay over multiple concentrations of mmUb - K240 / K286 also suggested a similar K D value as unmodiﬁed VASP ( Table 1 ) . However , these calculations are limited by the uncertainty of the maximum elongation rate for this protein . 4 | bioR χ iv McCormick et al . | Ubiquitination negatively regulates VASP activity Fig . 3 .

N = 145 events ( unmodiﬁed VASP ) and 131 events ( mUb - K240 / K286 ) from 2 experiments . To examine changes in actin polymerase activity in greater detail , we utilized total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) to determine the elongation rate of individual actin ﬁlaments . Each VASP construct ( 25 nM ) was mixed with 1 . 5 µM actin monomers ( 10 % AF - 488 labeled ) and spontaneous actin assembly was imaged for ten minutes ( Fig 3D , Supplemental Movie 1 ) . Focusing on the elongation rates of single actin ﬁlaments and parallel actin bundles , quantiﬁcation was largely consistent with bulk pyrene - actin polymerization . Unmodiﬁed VASP increased the mean actin elongation rate 1 . 8 - fold compared to actin alone . Although the activity of mUb - K286 was similar to unmodiﬁed VASP , both mUb - K240 and mmUb - K240 / K286 exhibited a decreased rate of elongation ( Fig 3D , E ) . Al - though we did not detect a signiﬁcantly changed elongation rate for mUb - K240 by pyrene actin elongation assays , we account this disparity to the higher sensitivity of the TIRF assays . 6 | bioR χ iv McCormick et al . | Ubiquitination negatively regulates VASP activity Fig . 5 . Multi - monoubiquitination of VASP enhances actin rufﬂing during cell spreading . ( A ) Representative wideﬁeld images of ﬁxed MVD7 cells with ﬁlopodial spreading morphology .

A Chi - square test for the goodness of ﬁt was used to compare outcomes with a Bonferroni correction . 92 - 104 cells were classiﬁed across the experiments . As the time - lapse movies progressed , we observed VASP - mediated bundling of actin ﬁlaments . In the presence of unmodiﬁed VASP , actin bundles quickly predominated the ﬁeld of view , obscuring the polymerization of single actin ﬁlaments ( Fig 3D , 250 and 500 s ) . Consistent with the low speed co - sedimentation assays , the impaired ability of mmUb - K240 / K286 to bundle actin ﬁlaments was visibly ap - parent at 500 s . To further probe the striking difference in actin polymerase activity between unmodiﬁed and mmUb - K240 / K286 VASP , we measured the actin elongation rate in the presence of either protein at a range of concentrations ( 1 . 25 nM - 10 nM ) . Although unmodiﬁed VASP exhibited a clear concentration - dependent increase in the elongation rate , mmUb - K240 / K286 failed to signiﬁcantly increase the rate of elongation compared to actin alone ( Fig 3E , Supplemental Movie 2 ) . Collectively , both seeded pyrene assays and TIRF data support the conclusion that the enhancement of new actin monomer addition is impaired by multi - monoubiquitination of VASP . Ubiquitinated VASP maintains anti - capping activity Capping protein binds to the barbed ends of actin ﬁlaments and terminates actin polymerization ( Cooper and Pollard , 1985 ) . Previous work demonstrated that VASP competes with capping protein for binding and thus protects the barbed end ( Barzik et al . , 2005 ) . The anti - capping activity of Ena / VASP proteins is essential for their unique contribution to maintaining the actin cytoskeleton . In cultured cells , loss of VASP was associated with short , highly branched actin ﬁlaments ( Bear et al . , 2002 ) .

Since Ena / VASP proteins can hetero - tetramerize ( Riquelme et al . , 2015 ) , we utilized MV D7 cells ( Bear et al . , 2000 ) , a mouse embryonic ﬁbrob - last line lacking all Ena / VASP family members , to simplify experiment interpretation . In this line , Enah ( the gene encoding Mena ) and Vasp were genetically deleted before subsequent selection for undetectable levels of EVL protein . Following electroporation of TAMRA - labeled VASP , cells were permitted to spread for thirty minutes before ﬁxation . Previous work characterized spreading of MV D7 cells into three phenotypes : smooth - edged cells containing a clear lamellipodia ; rufﬂed cells characterized by actin rufﬂes ; and ﬁlopodial - rich cells ( Applewhite et al . , 2007 ) . ( Fig 5A , Fig S2A ) . Using a low concentration of TAMRA - VASP electroporated into cells , we observed no changes in the distribution of these three classes from cells that were electroporated with buffer alone . However , electroporation of mmUb - K240 / K286 VASP decreased the proportion of ﬁlopodial - like cells and subsequently increased the propor - tion of rufﬂed cells ( Fig 5C ) . We observed no signiﬁcant changes in ﬁlopodia density ( in cells classiﬁed as ﬁlopodial ) , cell area , or phalloidin staining following electroporation of either construct ( Fig S2B ) . We observed localization of both TAMRA - VASP and TAMRA - mmUb - K240 / K286 to ﬁlopodial tips , lamellipodia , and focal adhesions in MVD7 cells ( Fig 5B ) . To further examine this localization , we electroporated each protein into MV D7 cells stably expressing GFP - VASP ( Fig 6A ) . We observed clear co - localization of TAMRA - VASP and GFP - VASP at all three of these actin - based structures . Although TAMRA - mmUb - K240 / K286 was present as well , its enrichment at each of these structures appeared dimin - ished . Quantiﬁcation of raw values indicated signiﬁcantly less mmUb - K240 / K286 VASP localized to ﬁlopodia tips compared to TAMRA - VASP ( Fig 6B ) . To compare the distribution of unmodiﬁed VASP and mmUb - K240 / K286 VASP that did localize within ﬁlopodia , we nor - malized VASP and actin levels along the length of ﬁlopodia . As previously reported ( Applewhite et al . , 2007 ; Rottner et al . , 1999 ; Lebrand et al . , 2004 ) , GFP - VASP was enriched at the tips of ﬁlopodia . In contrast , phalloidin staining was most intense at the base of the ﬁlopodia , tapering in intensity to - wards the tip . Whereas TAMRA - VASP mirrored GFP - VASP localization , the ﬁlopodial tip intensity of TAMRA - mmUb - K240 / K286 was diminished ( Fig 6C , D ) . Similarly , linescans were utilized to evaluate VASP localization within the lamel - lipodia . Both GFP - VASP and TAMRA - VASP strongly colo - calized at the cell periphery . Although TAMRA - mmUb - K240 / K286 was still present at the lamellipodia , the ﬂuores - cence intensity was decreased relative to GFP - VASP . Further - more , the ratio of ﬂuorescence intensity at the lamellipodia to the adjacent medial lamella was also decreased ( Fig 6E , F ) . Thus , multi - monoubiquitination of VASP reduced protein en - richment at both the ﬁlopodial tip and lamellipodia . that both GAB and FAB domain function is required for anti - capping activity ( Barzik et al . , 2005 ) , suggesting that ubiquitination at either K240 or K286 may modulate the anti - capping activity of VASP . To evaluate the anti - capping activity of VASP - Ub , we performed seeded pyrene assays in the presence of 5 nM mammalian capping protein ( Fig 4A ) . Compared to actin seeds alone , the addition of capping protein severely reduced actin elongation ( Fig 4B ) . As reported previously ( Bear et al . , 2002 ; Barzik et al . , 2005 ) , the addition of VASP counteracted capping protein in a concentration dependent manner . All three ubiquitinated versions of VASP enhanced actin elongation over capping protein and actin ( Fig 4B , C ) , suggesting that mono - and multi - monoubiquitinated VASP maintained anti - capping activity . Like pyrene assays in the absence of capping protein , our curve ﬁtting calculated similar K D values , further supporting a similar afﬁnity of unmodiﬁed and ubiquitinated VASP for the barbed end ( Table 2 ) . mmUb - K240 / K286 VASP maintains association with barbed end We observed striking deﬁcits in the ability of mmUb - K240 / K286 to increase the elongation rate of actin ﬁlaments , yet the protein still possessed anti - capping activity . To de - termine if VASP mmUb - K240 / K286 maintained interaction with the barbed end of actin ﬁlaments , we quantiﬁed the lifetime of VASP puncta bound to the barbed end in single molecule TIRFM imaging . This experiment is complicated by the relatively short lifetime of human VASP , previously measured at τ 1 = 1 . 45 s ( Hansen and Mullins , 2010 ) and τ 1 = 1 s ( Harker et al . , 2019 ) . However , the lifetime of VASP is increased on the trailing ﬁlament ends of fascin - bundled actin ( τ 1 = 2 . 6 s and 4 . 2 s for bundles containing two and three or more ﬁlaments , respectively ) ( Harker et al . , 2019 ) . Due to the maximum acquisition speed of the microscope ( 0 . 5 s / frame ) , we utilized fascin - bundled actin to more accurately quantify the lifetimes of unmodiﬁed VASP and VASP mmUb - K240 / K286 on the trailing ﬁlament of a two - ﬁlament bundle ( Fig 4D , E ) . We estimated the lifetime of unmodiﬁed VASP at τ 1 = 1 . 167 s ( 95 % CI = 1 . 094 to 1 . 245 s ) . We observed a similar dwell time ( τ 1 = 1 . 142 s ( 95 % CI = 1 . 007 to 1 . 301 s ) of mmUb - K240 / K286 at the barbed end ( Fig 4F ) . As inverse of puncta lifetime is a measurement of the k off rate , we infer that multimonoubiquitination did not affect the k off rate of VASP . mmUb - K240 / K286 VASP exhibits impaired function and localization in cells Previously , we demonstrated that the mutation of lysine residues in VASP—reducing VASP ubiquitination—resulted in increased ﬁlopodial number and stability in cultured murine neurons ( Menon et al . , 2015 ; Boyer et al . , 2020 ) . However , there is no primary coding sequence mutation that can mimic the ubiquitination of VASP in cells . To examine how ubiquitination of VASP altered its function and localization in cells , we electroporated puriﬁed , ubiqui - McCormick et al . | Ubiquitination negatively regulates VASP activity bioR χ iv | 9 may impair the acceleration of actin ﬁlament elongation . First , this deﬁcit may arise from an impaired ability of ubiquitinated VASP to interact with monomeric actin . Of note , K240 is adjacent to the GAB and a crystal structure of this region demonstrates L234 is an essential residue for monomeric actin binding ( Ferron et al . , 2007 ) . Although this structure suggests K240 lies in an unstructured region that does not directly bind the actin monomer , ubiquitin is 8 kD and has the potential to impair the binding between L234 and an actin monomer through steric hindrance . However , previous work indicates actin monomer binding is required for effective barbed end localization ( Hansen and Mullins , 2010 ) and we did not detect changes in barbed end dwell time . Alternatively , it is possible that the GAB maintains its monomeric actin binding activity and mUb - K240 may sterically impede the transfer of monomeric actin onto the ﬁlament . As ﬁlament elongation is severely reduced with the addition of a second ubiquitination site at K286 , this supports a model with impaired transfer of the actin monomer onto the ﬁlament . Interestingly , pyrene assays in the presence of 5 nM capping protein suggest that mmUb - K240 / K286 maintains anti - capping activity . In contrast , VASP constructs containing either GAB mutations ( R232E , K233E ) or FAB mutations ( Δ 256 - 273 ) completely lost the ability to protect barbed ends from capping protein ( Barzik et al . , 2005 ) , suggesting a functional GAB and FAB are needed for anti - capping activity of VASP . As such , these results support that mmUb - K240 / K286 maintains both GAB and FAB binding and instead there is a deﬁcit in the transfer of actin monomers onto the ﬁlament . N - terminal to the GAB domain , VASP also contains a poly - proline region that binds proﬁlin - actin . Previously published in vitro experiments have made mixed conclusions on the utilization of proﬁlin - actin by Ena / VASP proteins due to differences in experimental design ( Hansen and Mullins , 2010 ; Breitsprecher et al . , 2008 ; Brühmann et al . , 2017 ) . However , a recent cellular study suggests that Ena / VASP proteins do require proﬁlin - actin for leading edge actin poly - merization ( Skruber et al . , 2020 ) . Although ubiquitination at K240 or K286 is unlikely to impair VASP - proﬁlin binding within the polyproline region , whether ubiquitination may block the transfer of proﬁlin - actin to the GAB and FAB is not known . Multi - monoubiquitination of VASP regulates cell dynamics Precise regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is required for cell morphology and motility changes . However , cells must quickly adapt to a variety of stimuli , including extracellular cues . In this work , we electroporated TAMRA - VASP and TAMRA - mmUb - K240 / K286 VASP into MVD7 cells . In the presence of TAMRA - VASP mmUb - K240 / K286 , we observed changes in cell spreading morphology and intra - cellular localization of VASP . Because VASP and TRIM9 Conclusions The actin cytoskeleton performs many essential cellular functions ; thus actin polymerization must be tightly regu - lated . Due to their rapid occurrence and reversible nature , post - translational modiﬁcations are ideal candidates to help modulate actin dynamics yet , with the exception of phospho - rylation , are relatively understudied . Previously published work demonstrated non - degradative ubiquitination of VASP reduced ﬁlopodial number and stability ( Menon et al . , 2015 ; Boyer et al . , 2020 ) . Although the mechanistic impact of VASP ubiquitination was unclear , cellular assays suggested VASP was mono or multi - monoubiquitinated ( Boyer et al . , 2020 ) . Here we identiﬁed prominent ubiquitination of VASP at K240 and K286 , and generated recombinant forms of ubiquitinated VASP to interrogate actin regulatory functions . Whereas mUb - K286 did not signiﬁcantly affect VASP function in any of our tested assays , monoubiquitination of mUb - K240 signiﬁcantly reduced the ability of VASP to elongate actin ﬁlaments . A multi - monoubiquitinated construct ( mmUb - K240 / K286 ) showed signiﬁcant decreases in its ability to bind , bundle , and elongate actin ﬁlaments and localize to ﬁlopodia tips and lamellipodia . Mechanism of impairment of polymerase activity VASP enhances actin ﬁlament elongation , reﬂecting its ability to bind both G - actin and F - actin through respective GAB and FAB domains ( Hansen and Mullins , 2010 ) . We observed decreases in the ability of both mUb - K240 and mmUb - K240 / K286 to accelerate elongation of actin ﬁlaments . Seeded pyrene assays suggested all three ubiqui - tinated VASP proteins similarly associated with the barbed end of the actin ﬁlament , with a similar K D calculated for each protein . However , this interpretation is limited by the sensitivity of the pyrene assay . The 95 % conﬁdence interval for all three ubiquitinated proteins spanned a large range and we were unable to calculate an upper limit for mmUb - K240 / K286 . In contrast , we observed more dramatic differences in the elongation rates calculated through more sensitive single molecule TIRFM assays . At the range of concentrations tested ( 1 . 25 - 25 nM ) , we did not observe a signiﬁcantly different elongation rate for mmUb - K240 / K286 compared to actin alone . Although this could indicate that the binding afﬁnity of mmUb - K240 / K286 for the barbed end was decreased , several lines of evidence indicate that the protein maintains a reasonable association with the barbed end . First , mmUb - K240 / K286 , along with both single mUb VASP , maintained anti - capping activity , indicating interaction with barbed end . Second , we calculated similar lifetimes of unmodiﬁed VASP and mmUb - K240 / K286 bound to the barbed end . Although our measurements were limited by the speed of microscopy acquisition , we did not detect signiﬁcant differences between the two proteins . Collectively , pyrene elongation assays ( both in the presence and absence of capping protein ) and single molecule TIRFM assays suggest similar barbed end binding dynamics for unmodiﬁed VASP and mmUb - K240 / K286 . As such , we postulate other mechanisms by which mmUb - K240 / K286 10 | bioR χ iv McCormick et al . | Ubiquitination negatively regulates VASP activity colocalize at ﬁlopodia tips , we propose VASP monoubiqui - tination is mechanism to rapidly control ﬁlopodial activity . Furthermore , this modiﬁcation is reversible , avoiding the lengthy cycles of protein synthesis / degradation . E3 ligases exist in a balance with deubiquitinase ( DUB ) enzymes . Although we have demonstrated pharmacologically blocking DUB activity prevents VASP deubiquitination ( Menon et al . , 2015 ) , the DUB for VASP is unknown . Identiﬁcation of this enzyme is crucial to fully comprehend the cycle of VASP regulation in neurons , and in turn , cytoskeletal regulation . Previously published results demonstrated the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM9 is required for ubiquitination of VASP in cul - tured neurons and HEK293 cells ( Menon et al . , 2015 ; Boyer et al . , 2020 ) . However , in the absence of TRIM9 , residual VASP ubiquitination remained , suggesting redundancy with other E3 ligases ( Boyer et al . , 2020 ) . The discovery of additional TRIM9 substrates in developing neurons remains an open area of inquiry . Previously , we demonstrated the netrin - 1 receptor DCC is ubiquitinated in a TRIM9 - dependent manner ( Plooster et al . , 2017 ) . Although the type of ubiquitin modiﬁcation is still unknown , molecular weight shifts and protein stability similarly suggested that it is not degradative polyubiquitination . As DCC also localizes to the tips of ﬁlopodia ( Shekarabi and Kennedy , 2002 ) , this evokes a multi - faceted mechanism by TRIM9 to regulate ﬁlopodia function in neurons . A recent BioID experiment also identiﬁed a multitude of potential TRIM9 binding partners ( Menon et al . , 2021 , 2020 ) , yet additional work is required to validate these candidates as TRIM9 ubiquitination substrates . TRIM9 has been studied primarily in the context of neuronal development and neurodegeneration ( Menon et al . , 2015 ; Boyer et al . , 2020 ; Plooster et al . , 2017 ; Tanji et al . , 2010 ; Winkle et al . , 2016 ; Zeng et al . , 2019 ; Winkle et al . , 2016 ; Do et al . , 2018 ) . However , TRIM9 is also expressed in macrophages ( Tokarz et al . , 2017 ; Carthagena et al . , 2009 ) and various forms of cancer ( Yang et al . , 2020a ; Lin et al . , 2023 ; Zhang et al . , 2023 ; Mishima et al . , 2015 ) . Although the alteration of TRIM9 protein levels has been shown to affect cell proliferation , motility , and inﬂammation in cell lines , substrates of TRIM9 have not been identiﬁed in these studies . Of note , ﬁlopodia play a critical role in cell migration in various cancers ( Jacquemet et al . , 2015 ) and contribute to phagocytosis in macrophages ( Horsthemke et al . , 2017 ) . However , whether TRIM9 localizes to ﬁlopodia in these cells and is capable of ubiquitinating VASP is unknown . Non - degradative ubiquitination also modulates several other cytoskeletal pathways . For example , two isoforms of the oncogene Ras , a small GTPase that regulates nu - merous cytoskeleton effectors , are monoubiquitinated . Monoubiquitination of H - Ras at K117 increased GTP - GDP exchange , leading to increased Ras activity ( Baker et al . , 2013 ) . Likewise , monoubiquitination of K - Ras at K147 increased K - Ras activation by blocking binding to GTPase activating ( GAP ) proteins ( Baker et al . , 2013 ; Sasaki et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , mono - ubiquitination of K - Ras at K104 did not impair biochemical activity of the protein and the function of this ubiquitination site is still unknown ( Yin et al . , 2020 ) . Furthermore , the actin bundling protein fascin is monoubiquitinated by the E3 ligase Smurf1 at K247 and K250 . Biochemical studies showed mUb - K250 decreased actin bundle thickness and bundle persistence , while transfection of non - ubiquitinatable fascin increased cell migration in an adenocarcinoma cell line ( Lin et al . , 2016 ) . Deciphering the ubiquitination reaction Ubiquitination is a complex cascade , requiring the sequen - tial activity of an E1 ubiquitin - activating enzyme , an E2 conjugating enzyme , and an E3 ubiquitin ligase . As an E3 ligase , TRIM9 catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 enzyme onto the substrate . E3 ligases add speciﬁcity to ubiquitination reactions ; more than 600 mammalian E3 ligases have been identiﬁed ( Yang et al . , 2021 ) . However , the activity of an E3 ligase can change based on which E2 conjugating enzyme it partners with . Previous in vitro biochemical experiments have identiﬁed E2 partners of TRIM9—including UbcH5b / UBE2D2 and UBE2G2 ( Tanji et al . , 2010 ; Napolitano et al . , 2011 ) —however , how E2 partnership informs TRIM9 substrate selectivity in vivo is unknown . Likewise , how TRIM9 activity is regulated is un - known—whether by post - translational modiﬁcations or additional protein - protein interactions . E3 ubiquitin ligases are well - appreciated to form larger complexes to efﬁciently and speciﬁcally ubiquitinate their targets . For example , Melanoma Antigen Gene ( MAGE ) proteins bind certain E3 ligases and regulate E3 activity through a variety of mechanisms , including E2 protein stabilization and substrate binding ( Lee and Potts , 2017 ; Yang et al . , 2020b ) . Ubiquitination and phosphorylation crosstalk Post - translational modiﬁcations are essential regulators of protein stability , activity , and localization . Unlike ubiqui - tination , the mechanistic impact of VASP phosphorylation is well studied in numerous cell types . For example , phos - phorylation of VASP at S239 and T278 by cGMP - dependent protein kinase ( PKG ) reduced actin polymerization in vitro and ﬁlamentous actin levels in HEK293 cells ( Benz et al . , 2009 ) . Furthermore , work in human colon cancer carcinoma cell lines suggested pS239 reduces VASP enrichment at ﬁlopodia tips and decreases ﬁlopodia length ( Zuzga et al . , 2012 ) . Of note , cross talk may also occur between post - translational modiﬁcations , including between ubiquitination and phosphorylation . For example , phosphorylation of the small GTPase RhoA at Ser188 by PKA / PKG blocks ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the protein ( Rolli - Derkinderen et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast , phosphorylation of RhoA by the kinase Erk2 promotes RhoA ubiquitination ( Wei et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , our previous work suggests TRIM9 - mediated ubiquitination of DCC reduces phosphory - McCormick et al . | Ubiquitination negatively regulates VASP activity bioR χ iv | 11 et al . , 2015 ; Boyer et al . , 2020 ) . pRK5 - HA - Ubiquitin - WT was a gift from Ted Dawson ( Addgene plasmid 17608 ; http : / / n2t . net / addgene : 17608 ; RRID : Addgene _ 17608 ) ( Lim et al . , 2005 ) . pGEXTEV Flag PS - SSSS - UBG75C creation was previously described ( Brown et al . , 2016 ) . Cysteine - light His - VASP ( His - VASPCCC - SSA ) con - taining an N - terminal KCK motif was a gift from Dyche Mullins ( UCSF ) ( Hansen and Mullins , 2010 ) . To facilitate sortase labeling , the KCK motif was mutated to a GGG motif using Quik - Change mutagenesis . VASP K240C and VASP K286C were also generated using Quik - Change mutagenesis . VASP K240C , K286C was created by Azenta Life Sciences through site - directed mutagenesis . Primary antibodies used were a mouse monoclonal against c - Myc ( 9E10 ) ( 1 : 2000 WB , Hybridoma serum puriﬁed in - house ) and a rabbit polyclonal against the HA - tag ( 1 : 250 WB , ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc Cat 71 - 5500 ) . Fluorescent secondary antibodies included IRDye 680LT Goat anti - Rabbit IgG Secondary Antibody ( 1 : 10 , 000 WB , LI - COR Cat NC9030093 ) and IRDye 800CW Goat anti - Mouse IgG Sec - ondary Antibody ( 1 : 10 , 000 WB , LI - COR Cat NC9401841 ) . Other reagents included PR - 619 ( Fisher Scientiﬁc Cat # 66 - 214 - 125 ) , MG132 ( American Peptide Company # 81 - 5 - 15 ) , Alexa Fluor™ 488 Phalloidin ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc Cat # 22323 ) , Alexa Fluor™ 647 Phalloidin ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) , bismaleimidoethane ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc Cat # 22323 ) , and paraformaldehyde ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc Cat # PI28908 ) . Ubiquitination assay and immunoblotting The ubiquitination assay was performed as described pre - viously ( Menon et al . , 2015 ; Boyer et al . , 2020 ) . Cells were treated with MG - 132 for 1 hour before lysis in buffer containing 20 mM Tris - Cl , 250 mM NaCl , 3 mM EDTA , 3 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 1 % SDS , 2 mM DTT , 5 mM N - ethylmaleimide , protease , and phosphatase inhibitors . Lysates were vortexed , boiled for 20 minutes , cleared at 20 , 000 x g for ten minutes and diluted in lysis buffer lacking SDS to dilute the ﬁnal SDS concentration to 0 . 1 % . Myc monoclonal antibody was added and incubated overnight at 4°C with rocking . Protein A beads were added in the morning and incubated for 2 hours . After washing twice with lysis buffer , beads were resuspended in 1x Laemmli sample buffer . Samples were loaded on a 7 . 5 % SDS - PAGE gel , transferred on nitrocellulose membrane for 90 min ( 75 V ) , blocked in 5 % milk in TBST for 1 hr ( RT ) , and incubated with primary antibody overnight in 1 % milk in TBST . Membranes were washed 3x ( 5 minutes ) in TBST , incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hr , washed 3x ( 10 minutes ) in TBST , rinsed in PBS and imaged on an Odyssey ( LI - COR Biosciences ) . Mass spectrometry HEK293 cells were transfected with Myc - VASP using lation at Tyr1418 ( Plooster et al . , 2017 ) . With these results in mind , we note that the VASP ubiquitina - tion site ( K240 ) is located directly next to a phosphorylation site ( S239 ) and both modiﬁcations are associated with neg - atively regulating VASP function . As such , we ponder this biological redundancy . However , we can speculate that that VASP mUb - K240 is a more speciﬁc signaling pathway com - pared to S239 - P . The kinase PKG has a proliﬁc number of substrates and is stimulated by cGMP , a messenger with ef - fectors throughout the body . Indeed VASP is phosphorylated in this pathway , but it certainly will not be the only protein to be modiﬁed . In contrast , Trim9 is predominantly expressed in neurons and glia . Furthermore , TRIM9 shows speciﬁc en - richment at the ﬁlopodial tip , providing precise local access to VASP . We previously reported VASP is deubiquitinated in the presence of the guidance cue , netrin ( Menon et al . , 2015 ) . As mentioned above , the netrin receptor DCC also lo - calizes to the tips of ﬁlopodia ( Shekarabi and Kennedy , 2002 ) and is ubiquitinated in TRIM9 - dependent manner ( Plooster et al . , 2017 ) . Collectively , TRIM9 - mediated ubiquitination may serve as a ﬁlopodial - speciﬁc negative regulator of cytoskele - tal remodeling .

Beads were spun down at 200 x g , washed once with lysis buffer , and washed three times with wash buffer ( lysis buffer containing 500 mM NaCl and 1 % Triton ) . After a ﬁnal wash with 1 % SDS in PBS , beads were resuspended in 1x sample buffer ( Bio - rad ) with 50 mM DTT .

Immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to SDS - PAGE and stained with coomassie . The bands corresponding to VASP were excised and the proteins were reduced with 10mM DTT for 30 min at RT , alkylated with 100mM iodoac - etamide for 45 min in the dark at RT , and in - gel digested with either ArgC ( Promega ) overnight at 37°C or trypsin ( Promega ) for 1 hr at 37°C . Peptides were extracted , desalted with C18 spin columns ( Pierce ) and dried via vacuum centrifugation . Peptide samples were stored at - 80°C until further analysis .

Samples were injected onto an Easy Spray PepMap C18 column ( 75 µm id × 25 cm , 2 µm particle size ) ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) and separated over a 45 min method . The gradient for separation consisted of 5 – 38 % mobile phase B at a 250 nl / min ﬂow rate , where mobile phase A was 0 . 1 % formic acid in water and mobile phase B consisted of 0 . 1 % formic acid in 80 % ACN .

Raw data ﬁles were processed using Proteome Discov - erer version 2 . 5 ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . Peak lists were searched against the reviewed Uniprot human database , appended with a common contaminants database , using Se - quest . The following parameters were used to identify tryptic or ArgC peptides : 50 ppm precursor ion mass tolerance ; 0 . 02 Da product ion mass tolerance ; up to 3 missed trypsin cleavage sites ; ( C ) carbamidomethylation was set as a ﬁxed modiﬁcation ; ( M ) oxidation , ( S , T , Y ) phosphorylation , and ( K ) diGly were set as variable modiﬁcations .

Actin was puriﬁed from chicken skeletal - muscle ace - tone powder ( Spudich et al . , 1971 ) and labeled on lysines with Alexa488 - succinimidylested ( Isambert et al . , 1995 ) . Human fascin and mouse capping protein ( dual - expression construct of MmCP α 1 - His ( 6x ) - tag and SNAP - β 2 ; SNAP - CP ) were expressed in bacteria and puriﬁed as previously described ( Vignjevic et al . , 2006 ) ( Burke et al . , 2017 ) . Crosslinking Crosslinking protocols were adapted from previously pub - lished work ( Brown et al . , 2015 ) . His - VASP constructs and Ubiquitin G75C were reduced with 10 mM DTT and buffer exchanged into reaction buffer ( 50 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 0 ) , 200 mM NaCl ) . Ubiquitin was modiﬁed with 10 - molar excess BMOE ( Fisher ) for 30 minutes on ice and desalted into fresh reaction buffer . A 10 - fold excess of Ubiquitin - BMOE was added to His - VASP K240C and His - VASP K286C , with a 20 - fold excess added to His - VASP K240C , K286C . After a McCormick et al . | Ubiquitination negatively regulates VASP activity bioR χ iv | 13 1 - hour incubation ( on ice ) , the reaction was quenched with 10 mM BME .

After 1 hr incubation ( on ice ) , the reaction was quenched with 20 mM EGTA and buffer - exchanged to remove excess peptide . His - TEV and His - sortase were removed following incubation with nickel resin . TAMRA - VASP ubiquitination mimics were further puriﬁed over a Superose 6 column . Puriﬁed protein was stored in 10 mM HEPES , 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , and 10 % glycerol , aliquoted , and ﬂash frozen .

Cannon et al . , 2023 ) . Brieﬂy , imaging wells were assembled from imaging coverslips ( 24 × 50 mm2 , Thorlabs ) and adhesive , four - well gaskets ( Thorlabs ) . Measurements were acquired for 1 min at a frame rate of 100 fps at room temperature using AcquireMP software ( Refeyn Ltd , Oxford , UK ) using 15 nM VASP . Actin co - sedimentation assays Co - sedimentation assays were adapted from previously described protocols ( Zimmermann et al . , 2016 ) . Lyophilized rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( 99 % pure , Cytoskeleton ) was resuspended in water and diluted to 10 mg / mL in fresh Ca - G buffer ( 2mM Tris , pH 8 , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 1mM CaCl2 , 0 . 5mM DTT , 0 . 01 % NaN3 ) . After a one hr incubation on ice to depolymerize actin oligomers , actin was centrifuged ( 20 , 000 x g , 4°C ) for 20 minutes , and the concentration was conﬁrmed . Actin polymerization was induced by the addition of 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 10 mM EGTA , 10 mM MgCl2 , 50 mM NaCl , and 1 mM DTT and ﬁlaments were incubated for 1 hr at RT . For low speed sedimentation assays , varying amounts of VASP ( 100 - 600 nM ) and actin ﬁlaments ( 2 µM ) then incu - bated for 1 hr at RT before centrifugation at 10 , 000 x g ( RT ) in a tabletop centrifuge . The top 50 % of the supernatant was removed , mixed with 4xSB , and boiled . The remaining 50 % of the supernatant was discarded . The pellet was washed carefully in 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 10 mM EGTA , 10 mM MgCl2 , 50 mM NaCl , and 1 mM DTT . The pellet was then directly resuspended in 1xSB , transferred to an Eppendorf tube , and boiled . For high speed sedimentation assays , varying amounts of VASP ( 200 - 600 nM ) and actin ﬁlaments ( 1 µM ) then incubated for 1 hr at RT before centrifugation at 100 , 000 x g ( 23 ° C ) in a TLA100 rotor ( Beckman - Coulter ) . The top 50 % of the supernatant was removed , mixed with 4xSB , and boiled . The remaining 50 % of the supernatant was discarded . The pellet was washed carefully in 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 10 mM EGTA , 10 mM MgCl2 , 50 mM NaCl , and 1 mM DTT . The pellet was then directly resuspended in 1xSB , transferred to an Eppendorf tube , and boiled . Supernatant and pellet fractions were separated on SDS - PAGE gels and stained with Collodial Coomassie ( Invitrogen ) for 3 hrs . After destaining in water , gels were scanned on a Licor Odyssey and analyzed by densitometry in ImageStudio . Pyrene actin elongation assays Pyrene elongation assays were adapted from previously described protocols ( Zimmermann et al . , 2016 ) . Before starting , both rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( Cytoskeleton ) and pyrene - labeled rabbit skeletal muscle actin ( Cytoskeleton ) were spun at 100 , 000 x g for 1 hr at 4 oC a TLA100 rotor ( Beckman - Coulter ) . After conversion of Ca2 + - ATP - actin to Mg2 + - ATP - actin , polymerization of actin ﬁlaments ( 5 µM ) was initiated by adding in 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 10 mM EGTA , 10 mM MgCl2 , 50 mM NaCl , and 1 mM DTT and incubated for 1 hour at RT . Additional proteins ( VASP and / or capping protein ) were added to a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 5 µM ﬁlaments before the addition of 0 . 5 µM actin monomers ( 20 % pyrene - labeled ) . Pyrene ﬂuorescence was measured with a Spark Cyto ( Tecan ) or a CLARIOstar ( BMG Labtech ) plate reader . Microscope Descriptions TIRFM images were acquired using an Olympus IX - 71 microscope through TIRF illumination , recorded with a iXon EMCCD camera ( Andor Technology ) , and a cellTIRF 4Line system ( Olympus ) . All wideﬁeld imaging was performed using an inverted mi - croscope ( IX83 - ZDC2 ; Evident / Olympus ) equipped with a cMOS camera ( Orca - Fusion , Hamamatsu ) and Xenon light source Images were acquired using a 100× 1 . 50 NA TIRF objective ( Olympus ) and with Cellsens software ( Ev - ident / Olympus ) . Confocal microscopy was performed on an inverted laser scanning confocal microscopy ( LSM980 , Zeiss ) with a motorized X , Y stage and Z focus with high speed Piezo insert . The microscope is equipped with 4 diode lasers ( 405 , 488 , 561 , 633 ) . Images were acquired with 1x Nyquist sampling using a 63x 1 . 4 NA Plan - Apochromat oil objective ( Zeiss ) and 4 channel GaAsP detectors on Zen Blue 3 . 6 software . This microscope is equipped with Airyscan 2 , however , this module was not used in these experiments . TIRFM Assays Microscope slides and coverslips ( # 1 . 5 ; Fisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA ) were sonicated for 2 h with Helmanex III detergent ( Hellma Analytics , Müllheim , Germany ) . After rinsing in deionized water and drying , glass was incubated 14 | bioR χ iv McCormick et al . | Ubiquitination negatively regulates VASP activity HEPES , 20 mM EGTA , 4 mM MgSO4 , and 0 . 24 M sucrose ) directly to the media for 20 min at room temperature . Coverslips were washed 3x with PBS . After ﬁxation , cells were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 for 10 minutes and blocked with 10 % donkey serum ( Fisher Scientiﬁc Cat # OB003001 ) for 30 min . To visualize actin ﬁlaments , cells were incubated with AlexaFluor - 488 / 647 - Phalloidin at 1 : 400 or 1 : 200 ( respectively ) for 1 hour at room temperature . Cov - erslips were washed 3x with PBS , mounted in a homemade Tris / glycerol / n - propyl - gallate – based mounting media and sealed with nail polish . MV D7 cell analysis All images were processed and analyzed in ImageJ ( Schin - delin et al . , 2012 ) . For classiﬁcation of wideﬁeld cell spreading images , images were blinded . Cell masks were created using the phalloidin channel to quantify cell area , perimeter , and ﬂuorescence intensity . Cell classiﬁcation was based on the presence of a smooth and even lamellipodia ( smooth ) , a ﬁlopodial density greater than 0 . 1 ﬁlopodia / um perimeter ( ﬁlopodial ) , and the presence of actin rufﬂes ( rufﬂed ) as previously described ( Applewhite et al . , 2007 ) . Maximum projections were created from confocal images to analyze lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia protein enrichment . Images were manually background subtracted using an av - erage of blank regions on the coverslip . GFP - VASP images were used to draw linescans on each structure . To account for variability in lamellipodia thickness , four linescans were drawn per cell in areas with clear lamellipodia ( per GFP - VASP localization ) . Filopodia linescans were drawn from the ﬁlopodia tip to the base . Raw ﬁlopodial tip intensity values were calculated by averaging the ﬁrst four pixels ( 0 . 255 µ m ) of the ﬁlopodia . Heatmaps displaying protein localization were created based on FiloMap code ( Jacquemet , 2023 ) . Software All data analysis was completed in Prism 9 ( GraphPad ) . Figures were created in Adobe Illustrator . Supplementary Information Fig S1 displays MS / MS plots for ubiquitinated VASP pep - tides . Fig S2 shows ﬁlopodia number ( in ﬁlopodial cells ) , cell area , and phalloidin intensity is unchanged with TAMRA - VASP or TAMRA - VASP mmUb - K240 / K286 electroporation into MVD7 cells . Video 1 and 2 shows actin polymerization in the presence of VASP or ubiquitinated VASP correspond - ing to Fig 3D , E and Fig 3F , respectively . Table S1 details the curve ﬁtting parameters from seeded actin pyrene assays and Table S2 details curve ﬁtting parameters from seeded actin pyrene assays in the presence of capping protein with 1 mg / mL mPeg - Silane ( 5000 MW ) in 95 % ethanol , pH 2 . 0 overnight while shaking . Imaging ﬂow chambers were created using double - sided tape to form parallel wells ( Zimmermann et al . , 2016 ) . All TIRF assays utilized puriﬁed chicken muscle actin . Spontaneous actin assembly was initiated by mixing 1 . 5 µM Mg - Actin monomers ( 10 % AF488 labeled ) with 1x TIRF buffer ( 10 mM imidazole [ pH 7 . 0 ] , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid [ EGTA ] , 50 mM dithiothreitol [ DTT ] , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 50 µM CaCl2 , 15 mM glucose , 20 µg / ml catalase , 100 µg / ml glucose oxidase , and 0 . 5 % [ 400 cP ] methylcellulose ) , as well as any additional proteins such as VASP and Fascin . Samples were then transferred to ﬂow chambers and imaged at RT by TIRFM . Actin elongation rates were completed by manually tracking the elongation of single actin ﬁlaments or parallel actin bundles in FIJI and the average elongation rate for each ﬁlament was then calculated . Quantiﬁcation of 1 nM VASP at the barbed ends of actin ﬁlaments ( in the presence of 673 nM fascin ) was adapted from previously published work ( Harker et al . , 2019 ) . VASP residence was speciﬁcally quantiﬁed on the trailing ﬁlaments of 2 - ﬁlament bundles . Linescans were used to trace actin ﬁl - aments and kymographs were created in ImageJ to visualize the growth of the trailing barbed end . Dynamic VASP puncta binding was quantiﬁed ; stationary puncta were excluded , as they were assumed to be adhered to the coverslip . Likewise , puncta on actin bundles where the trailing versus leading ﬁlament was not evident were not included . Cumulative frequency of dwell times were calculated and ( 1 - Cumulative Frequency ) was ﬁt with a one - phase decay curve as described previously ( Hansen and Mullins , 2010 ) . Neon electroporation of MV D7 cells 25mm # 1 . 5 german glass coverslips ( Electron Microscopy Services Cat # 72290 - 12 ) ¬were cleaned with a Harrick Plasma Cleaner ( PDC - 32G ) . Coverslips were coated with 10 µg / mL Fibronectin ( Corning # 356008 ) and incubated for 1 hr at 32°C . MVD7 were electroporated using the Neon™ Transfection System ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc MPK5000 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were grown to 70 - 90 % conﬂuency , removed from the dish with Accutase ( Sigma - Aldrich Cat # A6964 ) , washed with PBS , and resuspended in Neon™ Resuspension Buffer R at a ﬁnal density of 0 . 5 × 10 8 cells / mL . In the ﬁnal 10 µL Neon reaction , 1 . 1 µM of protein and 440 , 000 cells were used . Neon settings were pulse voltage ( 1250 ) , pulse width ( 30 ms ) , pulse number ( 1 ) . 220 , 000 cells were plated per coverslip and incubated for 30 minutes at 32°C . Cells were ﬁxed by adding equivolume warm 8 % PFA in 2x PHEM buffer ( 120 mM PIPES , 50 mM McCormick et al . | Ubiquitination negatively regulates VASP activity bioR χ iv | 15 Acknowledgements This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants R35GM135160 ( S .
