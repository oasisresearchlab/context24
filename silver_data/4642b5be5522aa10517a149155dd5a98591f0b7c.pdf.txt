A novel role for survivin in erythroblast enu - cleation . Haematologica 2012 ; 97 ( 10 ) : 1471 - 1479 . doi : 10 . 3324 / haematol . 2011 . 061093 Online Supplementary Design and Methods Cell culture Mouse erythroleukemia ( MEL , line F4 - 12B2 ) and K562 ( human erythroleukemia ) cell lines were cultured in RPMI medium with 2 mM L - glutamine , 10 % FBS , 100 U / mL of penicillin and 100 m g / mL of streptomycin . K562 cells were differentiated into ery - throid cells by the addition of cytosine arabinoside to a final con - centration of 1 m M . Immunofluorescence Cells were washed and layered onto cover slips treated with VECTABOND ( Vector Laboratories ) and incubated at 37ºC for 5 - 10 min . The adherent cells were then washed once in PBS and fixed in 3 . 75 % paraformaldehyde / PBS and permeabilized by 0 . 1 % Triton - X - 100 / PBS . After 1 h of blocking in 3 % BSA / PBS , the cover slips were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with primary antibodies ( survivin at 1 : 50 , lamin B at 1 : 100 , INCENP at 1 : 50 , clathrin at 1 : 200 , EPS15 at 1 : 200 and aurora B kinase at 1 : 200 ) , washed and incubated for 1 h in secondary antibodies ( 1 : 200 dilution ) . Actin was visualized by staining with rho - damine phalloidin ( 1 : 40 dilution ) . After a final washing , the cover slips were mounted with anti - fade reagent . Confocal images were acquired with a Leica SP - 5 spectral 2 - photon confocal microscope and deblurred by Leica software . Analysis of confocal images Images were analyzed for co - localization by the Co - Localisation Threshold pluggin ( available from the Wright Cell Imaging Facility at University Health Network Research ) . This software quantifies the degree of co - localization between two 8 - or 16 - bit images or stacks using Costes co - localization quantifi - cation . Details of the effectiveness and statistical significance of this software have been reported elsewhere . 1 We used this soft - ware to determine the overlap between pixels in different chan - nels ( reported as percentage volume overlap ) throughout the entire z stack . While calculating the threshold , zero - zero pixels are excluded . We analyzed the percentage volume overlap between survivin and either aurora B , INCENP , EPS15 , clathrin or actin for 14 individual enucleating cells ( individual points ) and plotted the values ( Figure 1F ) . Linear regression was used to determine the best fit ( colored lines ) . The mean percentage vol - umes of survivin co - localized with aurora B kinase , INCENP , EPS15 , clathrin and actin were calculated to be : 19 . 5 % ( range 11 . 7 - 27 . 5 ) , 17 . 8 % ( 9 . 1 - 26 . 5 ) , 56 . 75 % ( 48 . 5 - 64 . 9 ) , 37 . 2 % ( 28 . 5 - 45 . 9 ) and 60 . 6 % ( 52 . 7 - 68 . 5 ) , respectively ( 98 % Confidence Interval ) . Note that the extent of survivin co - localization with EPS15 , actin and clathrin is 2 - 3 fold greater than the extent of co - localization of survivin with aurora B kinase or INCENP . Also , the percentage volumes calculated above were compared by Student’s t - test and the corresponding P values for their compar - isons are listed in Figure 1G . This analysis reveals that there is a significant difference between co - localization of survivin with EPS15 and aurora B ( P = 4 . 86E - 6 ) . Similarly , there is a significant difference between co - localizations of survivin with clathrin and survivin with actin and that of survivin and aurora B ( P = 0 . 0012 and P = 8 . 67E - 6 , respectively ) . Immunoprecipitations Extracts from undifferentiated K562 cells or from K562 cells differentiated for 72 h were prepared in co - IP lysis buffer ( 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM NaCl , 0 . 75 % NP - 40 , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM DTT and protease inhibitors , Sigma ) and then pre - cleared by the addition of Protein G Sepharose Fast Flow beads ( GE healthcare ) . Cleared lysates were incubated with anti - bodies and beads overnight at 4ºC and the protein bound beads are washed 2 times in wash buffer I ( 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM NaCl and 0 . 75 % NP - 40 ) and II ( 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 and 0 . 05 % sodium deoxy - cholate ) , and once with wash buffer III ( 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 and 0 . 05 % sodium deoxycholate ) . Washed bound pro - teins were denatured from beads by LDS sample buffer ( Invitrogen ) and loaded onto 12 % PAGE . Co - immunoprecipitations in primary human erythroblasts were performed using m MACS Protein A / G Microbeads and m Columns purchased from Miltenyi Biotec . Primary erythroblast lysates were prepared in a high salt lysis buffer [ 500mM NaCl , 1 % Igepal CA 630 ( NP - 40 ) , 50 mM Tris HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , Complete protease inhibitor cocktail - EDTA free ( Roche Diagnostics ) ] , pre - cleared , incubated with antibody and magnetic beads for 30 min to 1 h and captured using m MACS separation unit . After washing 4 - 5 times with high salt lysis buffer and a low salt wash buffer ( 1 % Igepal CA 630 ( NP - 40 ) , 50 mM Tris HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) , the immunoprecipitated proteins were recovered using SDS gel load - ing buffer ( 50mM Tris HCl ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 50 mM DTT , 1 % SDS , 0 . 005 % bromophenol blue , 10 % glycerol ) . For immunoprecipita - tion assays , EPS15 ( rabbit antibody from Covance ) at a dilution of 1 : 250 , clathrin heavy chain ( X22 ) at 1 : 250 dilution and normal isotype IgGs ( Abcam ) were used . Enucleation assays of primary murine erythroblasts For enucleation assays of fetal liver erythroblasts , cells were collected from E12 . 5 - 14 . 5 wild - type C57Bl / 6 embryos and sub - jected to Ter119 depletion ( Stem Cell Technologies ) such that mature erythroblasts and reticulocytes are removed . Enucleation assays were then performed as described . 1 To knock - out the sur - vivin gene , fetal liver cells were collected from survivin fl / fl embryos 2 , 3 and immature fetal erythroblasts were then incubated with 1 . 6 m M TAT - Cre , 4 TAT - Scr ( TAT fused to a scrambled sequence ; a gift from Dr . Michael Thirman ) , or no TAT protein in serum free medium for 1 h at 37ºC . After this TAT protein treat - ment , the experiment was performed as described above for wild - type cells . The percentages of reticulocytes were quantified at 48 h by gating on the Syto 64 low and Ter119 - PE ( BD Biosciences ) positive populations . Student’s t - test ( paired , two - tail distribution ) was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences in enucleation . Enucleation assays of primary human erythroblasts Human primary CD34 + early hematopoietic cells were cul - tured in vitro towards erythroid lineage as described . 5 Knockdown experiments were performed as previously reported . 6 Survivin ( L - 003459 - 00 ) , EPS15 ( L - 004005 - 00 ) or a non - targeting control ( D - 001810 - 10 ) ON - TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA were pur - chased from Dharmacon , Thermo Scientific . Electron microscopy Terminal erythroblasts derived from fetal liver progenitors after 48 h of differentiation were processed and sectioned as pre - viously described . 6 Images were acquired using a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope ( JEOL , USA , Inc . , Peabody , MA , USA ) and analyzed with GatanDigitalMicrograph software . Vectors Human full - length survivin cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3 , pcDNA3 - HA ( Invitrogen ) and pEF1 α Biotag such that the epitope tags were present at the C - terminal end of the protein . In vivo biotinylation and survivin complex purification In vivo biotinylation of survivin was performed as described by de Boer et al . 7 with minor modifications . pEF1 α Biotag - survivin ( neomycin resistant ) and pEF1 α BirA ( puromycin resistant ) vec - tors were transfected into MEL cells and individual clones were double selected with 300 m g / mL G418 ( Invitrogen ) and 10 ng / mL puromycin ( Sigma ) . Similarly , control clones were generated by selecting for MEL cells harboring empty pEF1 α Biotag and pEF1 α BirA vectors . Lysates of 1x10 9 exponentially growing sta - ble cells were passed through streptavidin mutein matrix columns ( Roche Applied Sciences ) and bound proteins were puri - fied according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Eluted proteins were concentrated in an Ultracel YM - 10 Centricon filter ( Millipore ) and then passed through a Superdex s200 column to further purify the complexes ( see below ) . Peak survivin contain - ing fractions were pooled , concentrated , and subjected to mass spectrometry . The protein complexes were digested with trypsin , loaded onto a Zorbax 300SB - C18 reversed phase column and then analyzed by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry ( LC−MS / MS ) on an Agilent XCT ion trap . 8 Mascot and Spectrum Mill were used to identify proteins based on MS / MS spectra using NCBInr and MSDB databases for mouse proteins . Gel chromatography In order to compare the approximate size of survivin protein complexes formed by biotinylated and endogenous forms of sur - vivin , and also to separate the supernumerary survivin complex - es from other proteins , we performed gel chromatography with a Superdex s200 column ( GE Healthcare ) . The column was equil - ibrated with the co - IP lysis buffer lacking detergent and enzymes ( 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM NaCl , 10 % glyc - erol , 1 mM DTT and 50 m g / mL PMSF ( Sigma ) and then 2 mL of protein ( 2 - 2 . 3 mg ) was loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 0 . 3 mL / min . The eluted proteins were collected for 2 min per tube , and 60 tubes were collected per sample . The OD 280 profile of the protein flow - through is shown in Online Supplementary Figure S1C and D ) . The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and either stained with silver ( Online Supplementary Figure S2A and B ) or analyzed by a Western blot for survivin / INCENP ( Figure 2B ) . Flow cytometry All acquisitions were performed on an LSRII flow cytometer ( BD ) . Data were analyzed using FlowJo software ( TreeStar , Ashland , OR , USA ) . Animals Survivin floxed mice were obtained from E Conway and A Winoto . 3 Animal studies were approved by the Northwestern University IACUC . Three primers ( Adv17 , Adv25 and Adv28 ) were used to genotype the wild - type , floxed and Cre - deleted survivin allele , as previously described . 2 References 1 . Ji P , Jayapal SR , Lodish HF .

( A ) Multiple MEL cell clones that over - express biotinylated survivin or only express the biotag ligase were differentiated with 2 % DMSO for five days . The levels of survivin protein were assayed by Western blot on Days 3 , 4 and 5 of differentiation . Endogenous and biotinylated isoforms of survivin are marked for comparison . ( B ) Cell lysates from multiple untagged human survivin over - expressing MEL cell clones were subjected to Western blotting and immunostaining with anti - sur - vivin and anti - HSC - 70 antibodies .
