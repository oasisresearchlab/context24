In this study , we found that Hsp90 inhibitors have potent antiviral activity against standard or drug - resistant HSV - 1 strains and viral gene and protein synthesis are inhibited in an early phase . More detailed studies demonstrated that Hsp90 is upregulated by virus entry and it interacts with virus . Hsp90 knockdown by siRNA or treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors significantly inhibited the nuclear transport of viral capsid protein ( ICP5 ) at the early stage of HSV - 1 infection . In contrast , overexpression of Hsp90 restored the nuclear transport that was prevented by the Hsp90 inhibitors , suggesting that Hsp90 is required for nuclear transport of viral capsid protein . Furthermore , HSV - 1 infection enhanced acetylation of a - tubulin and Hsp90 interacted with the acetylated a - tubulin , which is suppressed by Hsp90 inhibition . These results demonstrate that Hsp90 , by interacting with acetylated a - tubulin , plays a crucial role in viral capsid protein nuclear transport and may provide novel insight into the role of Hsp90 in HSV - 1 infection and offer a promising strategy to overcome drug - resistance .

The HSV - 1 virion consists of a relatively large , double - stranded , linear DNA genome encased within an icosahedral protein cage called the capsid [ 2 ] . HSV - 1 has mainly oral and ocular manifestations , and after primary infection , the virus can establish latency in the trigeminal or cervical ganglia . The latent virus can then be reactivated to induce neurite damage and neuronal death . The currently available anti - HSV drugs are mainly nucleoside analogs , such as acyclovir ( ACV ) , and all of them target viral DNA replication . However , drug - resistant HSV strains , and particularly ACV - resistant HSV strains , emerge frequently [ 3 , 4 ] . Therefore , the development of new anti - HSV agents with different mechanisms of action is a matter of great urgency . Rapid progress has been achieved based on a deep under - standing of the molecular mechanisms involved in different phases of the HSV - 1 life cycle [ 3 ] . After entering into the cytoplasm , nuclear targeting of incoming viruses depends on the cellular cytoskeleton - mediated transport system [ 5 ] . Actin filaments play a crucial role for short - range movement and viral penetration or endocytosis [ 6 ] , whereas microtubules ( MTs ) provide tracks for the long - distance transport of endocytic / exocytic vesicle because of the directionality of MTs [ 7 ] . Incoming HSV - 1 particles are transported along MTs to the nucleus via interactions with an MT - dependent cellular molecular motor known as the cytoplas - mic dynein / dynactin complex . Given that most of the tegument is lost during entry or stays in the cytoplasm , the viral protein ( s ) that are candidates for directly engaging dynein / dynactin include the remaining inner tegument and capsid proteins . Although MTs enable the proper movement of cytosolic capsids into the nucleus [ 7 ] , further details regarding viral intracellular translocation remain unknown . Heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) is a highly conserved molecular chaperone that plays essential roles in constitutive cell signaling and adaptive responses to stress , such as microbial infection [ 8 ] . Hsp90 accounts for 1 – 2 % of the total protein in unstressed cells , and in mammals , there are two cytoplasmic Hsp90 isoforms , the stress induced Hsp90 a and the constitutively expressed Hsp90 b , as well as an ER resident homologue Grp94 ( also called gp96 ) , and a mitochondrial variant , TRAP1 [ 9 ] . Additionally , Hsp90 has been PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99425 shown to be important for many different viruses that require chaperone functions for viral protein folding , replication , trans - port , and assembly [ 10 ] . In fact , the dependence of viruses on Hsp90 appears to be nearly universal . Strikingly , for viruses tested to date , replication appears to be sensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors at concentrations not affecting cellular viability [ 11 ] . Geldanamycin ( GA ) , an Hsp90 inhibitor , can inhibit the replication of HSV - 1 [ 12 ] . In our previous studies [ 13 , 14 ] , we reported the in vitro and in vivo anti - HSV activity of 2 - aminobenzamide derivatives , including BJ - B11 , SNX - 25a , SNX - 2112 , and SNX - 7081 , which are all Hsp90 inhibitors . These inhibitors displayed significant efficacy against herpes simplex keratitis in a rabbit model and mainly exerted antiviral effects in the early stage of infection . However , the underlying mechanism of action has not been determined to date . In the present study , we found that HSV - 1 infection stimulates upregulation and nuclear translocation of Hsp90 , which coincide with the enhanced acetylation of a - tubulin and the nuclear transport of the viral capsid protein ICP5 . We also revealed that inhibition of Hsp90 prevents ICP5 nuclear transport and tubulin acetylation . Furthermore , Hsp90 inhibitors demonstrated potent antiviral effects against a drug - resistant HSV - 1 strain and a laboratory strain . This study provides novel insight into the mechanisms of Hsp90 action that are involved in HSV - 1 early infection and offering a promising strategy against drug - resistant HSV - 1 infection . Materials and Methods Cells and Viruses MRC - 5 cells ( ATCC ) and Vero cells ( ATCC ) were cultured as described previously [ 15 ] . All experiments were performed with the HSV - 1 strain F ( ATCC ) , a kind gift from Hong Kong University . The clinical - isolated ACV - resistant HSV - 1 strain ( named C106 ) used in this work was obtained from the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health [ 16 ] . Compounds , Antibodies , Reagents , and Plasmids BJ - B11 was synthesized according to previously reported methods [ 17 ] . ACV and 17 - AAG were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals . The primary antibodies used in this work are as follows : mouse monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) against the HSV - 1 + HSV - 2 ICP5 major capsid protein ( Abcam ) , a mouse mAb against the HSV - 1 ICP8 major DNA - binding protein ( Abcam ) , a mouse mAb against the HSV - 1 + HSV - 2 ICP27 protein ( Abcam ) , an anti - Hsp90 rabbit mAb ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , an anti - Hsp90 mouse mAb ( Santa Cruz ) , an anti - a - tubulin rabbit mAb ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , an anti - acetyl - a - tubulin Lys40 rabbit mAb ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , and an anti - GAPDH rabbit mAb ( Cell Signaling Technology ) . The secondary antibodies included Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated goat anti - mouse or anti - rabbit IgG ( H + L ) ( Invitrogen ) , Alexa Fluor 647 - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( H + L ) ( Invitrogen ) , horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated anti - mouse / rabbit IgG ( GE Healthcare ) . For immunoprecipita - tion , Protein A / G PLUS - Agarose ( Santa Cruz ) and normal mouse / rabbit IgG ( Santa Cruz ) were used . To construct an Hsp90 a overexpression vector ( pEGFP - Hsp90 a ) , the human Hsp90 a coding sequence without the TGA stop codon was cloned from the total cDNA of MRC - 5 cells with the forward primer 5 9 - AAA ACT GCA GAT GCC TGA GGA AAC CCA GAC - 3 9 and the reverse primer 5 9 - CGG GGT ACC TCTA CTT CTT CCA TGC GTG - 3 9 . The PCR fragment was then digested with Pst I ( Takara ) and Kpn I ( Takara ) and inserted into the multiple cloning site of the pEGFP - N1 plasmid ( Clontech ) under the control of the cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter . The recombinant pEGFP - Hsp90 a vector was successfully constructed , as confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis . Plaque Assay Plaque assay was used to determine the virus titers [ 15 ] . Briefly , Vero cells were seeded into 12 - well plates before the cells were incubated with virus suspension . After appropriate time the virus inoculum was then removed and the overlay medium ( DMEM containing 2 % FBS and 1 % methylcellulose ) was added . After an additional 72 h of incubation , the cell monolayers were fixed with 10 % formalin and stained with 1 % crystal violet . The plaques were counted , and the virus titers were calculated . Antiviral Activity Assay MTT assay was first used to assess the cytotoxicity of compounds [ 18 ] . The 50 % cytotoxic concentration ( CC 50 ) was calculated from three independent experiments and expressed as the mean 6 SD . Then anti - HSV - 1 activity of the compounds was evaluated by a virus - induced CPE inhibitory assay . A plaque reduction assay was also used to evaluate the HSV - 1 inhibition activity of compounds . According to the observed number of plaques , the IC 50 value was defined as the minimal concentrations of each tested compound that was required to reduce the plaque number by 50 % and was calculated as previously described [ 19 ] . Transfection The transfection of MRC - 5 cells with the pEGFP - Hsp90 a or pEGFP - N1 plasmid was performed with Lipofectamine LTX and PLUS reagents ( Invitrogen ) . For a 24 - well transfection , 1 . 5 m g of the pEGFP - Hsp90 a or pEGFP - N1 plasmid was used . SiRNA transfection was conducted using Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent ( Invitrogen ) . The Hsp90 a - siRNA duplex consisted of oligonucleotides with the sequences 5 9 - CUA CAA UUC CUC UGA UAA U - 3 9 and 5 9 - AUU AUC AGA GGA AUU GUA G - 3 9 . A scrambled siRNA duplex of the oligonucleotides 5 9 - UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG UTT - 3 9 and 5 9 - ACG UGA CAC GUU CGG AGA ATT - 3 9 , which do not target any gene product , was used as a negative control . All siRNAs were obtained from Sigma - Aldrich . For a 24 - well transfection , 1 m g of RNAi duplex was used and at 48 h post - transfection , the cells were infected with HSV - 1 for further studies . Real - time Fluorescent Quantitative RT - PCR The total RNAs of cells infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 10 ) for different times in the presence of 0 . 8 m M Hsp90 inhibitor were extracted ( TRIzol reagent from Invitrogen ) and reverse tran - scribed ( PrimeScript RT reagent Kit , Takara ) according to the manufacture . Then the mRNA expression levels were determined and analyzed using Bio - Rad CFX96 real - time PCR system ( Bio - Rad ) [ 14 ] . The mRNA expression levels were normalized to GAPDH expression . The primer pairs used were as follows : HSV - 1 UL54 F ( 5 9 - TGG CGG ACA TTA AGG ACA TTG - 3 9 ) , UL54 R ( 5 9 - TGG CCG TCA ACT CGC AGA - 3 9 ) , HSV - 1 UL29 F ( 5 9 - AGC TCG TCC GTG TAC GTC TT - 3 9 ) , UL29 R ( 5 9 - CCC TCG GTA ACG ACC AGA TA - 3 9 ) , HSV - 1 UL27 F ( 5 9 - GCC TTC TTC GCC TTT CGC - 3 9 ) , UL27 R ( 5 9 - CGC TCG TGC CCT TCT TCT T - 3 9 ) , Hsp90 a F ( 5 9 - ACA GGG TCT CAC TCT GTC G - 3 9 ) , Hsp90 a R ( 5 9 - GGA AGG ATA GCA GTG TTA GG - 3 9 ) , GAPDH F ( 5 9 - CCC ACT CCT CCA CCT TTG AC - 3 9 ) , and GAPDH R ( 5 9 - TCT TCC TCT TGT GCT CTT GC - 3 9 ) . Hsp90 Promotes HSV - 1 Capsid Protein Nuclear Trafficking PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99425 To detect gene expression after Hsp90 a siRNA or pEGFP - Hsp90 a plasmid transfection , MRC - 5 cells grown in 24 - well culture plates were first transfected with Hsp90 a siRNA or scrambled siRNA or the pEGFP - Hsp90 a or pEGFP - N1 plasmids . The cells were then infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 10 ) , treated with Hsp90 inhibitors at 48 h post - transfection , harvested , and analyzed for gene expression , as described above . Laser Scanning Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy To quantify HSV - 1 capsid protein ICP5 trafficking to the nuclear , MRC - 5 cells grown in 25 - cm 2 culture flasks were transfected with the pEGFP - Hsp90 a or pEGFP - N1 plasmid or treated with 0 . 8 m M BJ - B11 and infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 10 ) for different lengths of time . The samples were processed as described before [ 17 ] . Briefly , after fixing , permeabilizing and blocking , the cells were immunostained with a primary antibody against HSV - 1 ICP5 ( 1 : 3000 ) for 1 h , and the cells were then probed with an Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated anti - mouse antibody ( 1 : 1000 ) for another 1 h . Additionally , 1 mg / ml DAPI ( Biotium ) and 5 m M TRITC - phalloidin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) were added to label nuclei ( 15 min ) and F - actin ( 40 min ) , respectively . Finally , fluorescence images were captured with a confocal laser scanning microscope ( Zeiss ) . In addition , each dish was acquired at least five fields of view for the purpose of counting the number of ICP5 associated nuclei ( here defined as positive nuclei ) , percentage of which was calculated to evaluate the effect of Hsp90 inhibitors on virus entry and intracellular migration . For total Hsp90 and HSV - 1 ICP5 observation , MRC - 5 cells were infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 10 ) for 4 h in the presence of 0 . 8 m M Hsp90 inhibitor . The cells were then stained with anti - ICP5 antibody and an Alexa Fluor 647 - conjugated anti - mouse antibody ( 1 : 1000 ) . For anti - Hsp90 antibody ( 1 : 500 ) staining , an Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated secondary antibody ( 1 : 1000 ) was used . To observe the relationship between Hsp90 and acetyl - a - tubulin , MRC - 5 cells were stained with anti - acetyl - a - tubulin ( 1 : 1000 ) antibody and Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated secondary antibody ( 1 : 1000 ) . An Alexa Fluor 647 - conjugated secondary antibody ( 1 : 1000 ) was used for anti - Hsp90 antibody ( 1 : 500 ) staining . Western Blotting MRC - 5 cells infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 10 ) for different lengths of time in the presence or absence of inhibitors were lysed in RIPA buffer ( Beyotime , China ) and separated by 6 – 15 % gradient SDS - PAGE . Then the samples were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with primary and HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies . Interested proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( Beyotime , China ) . The band intensity of each protein was calculated using Image J software and normalized to GAPDH . The fold change of each protein was compared with the cell control . Co - immunoprecipitation ( Co - IP ) MRC - 5 cells were treated with Hsp90 inhibitor ( 0 . 8 m M ) and infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 10 ) for 4 h . The cells were then lysed and the protein concentrations were measured and adjusted to 1 mg / mL . The lysate was precleared by adding 1 . 0 m g of the appropriate control IgG ( normal mouse or rabbit IgG , corre - sponding to the host species of the primary antibody ) , together with 20 m L of resuspended volume of Protein A / G PLUS - Agarose . Afterwards , the mixture was incubated at 4 u C for 30 min . The optimal dilution of primary antibody was added to the cell lysates ( supernatant ) , incubated for 1 h at 4 u C , and then incubated at 4 u C overnight with 20 m L of resuspended volume of Protein A / G PLUS - Agarose . Next , the immunoprecipitates were collected , washed with PBS , and resuspended in 40 m L 1 6 SDS - PAGE buffer ( Beyotime , China ) . The samples were boiled for 2 – 3 min and analyzed by Western blotting and autoradiography , and total - protein samples were used as the input control . Results Hsp90 Inhibitors Exhibit Potent Inhibitory Activity against a Drug - resistant HSV - 1 Strain First the antiviral effect of BJ - B11 , a novel Hsp90 inhibitor [ 20 ] , the representative Hsp90 inhibitor 17 - N - allylamino - 17 - demethox - ygeldanamycin ( 17 - AAG ) and ACV , which served as positive controls representing an anti - HSV - 1 drug was determined ( Table 1 ) . Both BJ - B11 and 17 - AAG exhibited significant inhibitory activity more potent than that of ACV against ACV - resistant strain . BJ - B11 was less cytotoxic than 17 - AAG and more potent in inhibiting HSV - 1 replication . Hsp90 Inhibitors Exhibit Antiviral Activity Mainly in the Early Stage of Infection We also confirmed the antiviral effects of Hsp90 inhibitors on HSV - 1 replication . MRC - 5 cells were infected with HSV - 1 in the present of Hsp90 inhibitors ( 0 . 8 m M ) , and total RNA samples were extracted at 4 , 6 and 9h post - infection ( p . i . ) , and viral UL54 ( Immediate early gene ) , UL29 ( Early gene ) and UL27 ( Late gene ) were assayed by quantitative real - time PCR , respectively ( Fig . 1A ) . Expressions of all viral genes were significantly suppressed by treatment of Hsp90 inhibitors . Down - regulation of the immediate early gene expression suggested that viral nuclear trafficking may be inhibited . Besides , the expressions of ICP27 ( Immediate early protein ) , ICP8 ( Early protein ) and ICP5 ( Late protein ) were also reduced in the presence of Hsp90 inhibitors ( Fig . 1B ) . To further identify the time point of Hsp90 inhibitor action , we detected the expression of both an early gene ( UL29 ) and an early protein ( ICP8 ) at different time point p . i . ( Fig . 1C and 1D ) . Compared with the viral control , the expression of UL29 and ICP8 was significantly reduced by Hsp90 inhibitors from 4 h p . i . These results indicated that BJ - B11 and 17 - AAG exhibit antiviral activity mainly in the early stage of infection . Nuclear Transport of Hsp90 Coincides with Viral Capsid Protein ICP5 at the Early Stage of HSV - 1 Infection To define the role of Hsp90 in HSV - 1 infection , we first examined the expression of total Hsp90 protein at different time points after infection ( Fig . 2A ) . In HSV - 1 - infected cells , Hsp90 was significantly upregulated at 4 hours and 6 hours p . i . Subcellular localization of Hsp90 at 4 h p . i . was also analyzed using laser scanning confocal immunofluorescence microscopy ( Fig . 2B ) . In uninfected cells , the Hsp90 protein was predominantly diffuse in the cytoplasm , whereas Hsp90 was enriched in the nucleus of HSV - 1 - infected cells . We further study the major viral capsid protein ICP5 with immunofluoresence staining . ICP5 is a viral late gene - encoded protein that synthesized mainly at late times ( . 12 h p . i . ) during HSV - 1 infection and at an early time ( , 6 h p . i . ) the ICP5 dot in the cytoplasm can represent incoming virions . We found that Hsp90 and ICP5 were co - localized to the nucleus of infected cells at 4 h p . i . In addition , co - immunoprecipitation ( co - IP ) experiment was performed to confirm the interaction between Hsp90 and ICP5 ( Fig . 2C ) .

Hsp90 inhibitors suppress viral RNA synthesis and protein expression . ( A ) Inhibition of viral RNA synthesis . MRC - 5 cells were infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 10 ) in the presence of Hsp90 inhibitor ( 0 . 8 m M ) .

Besides , by over - expressing of GFP - fused Hsp90 in cells , we still found that GFP - Hsp90 was directly associated with viral ICP5 protein . These results demonstrated that HSV - 1 infection induces Hsp90 upregulation and nuclear translocation , which interacts with ICP5 , suggesting Hsp90 is involved in the nuclear transport of viral capsid protein ICP5 . Hsp90 Interacts with Acetylated a - tubulin Recent reports have shown that microtubule - disrupting drugs strongly reduced the transport of HSV - 1 capsids to the nucleus [ 21 ] and acetylated tubulin can enhance MT - binding and transport of the motor protein kinesin - 1 [ 22 ] . Influenza A virus infection enhances the acetylation of tubulin [ 23 ] , thus prompting us to examine whether HSV - 1 infection can induce MT acetylation . Apparently , the expression of acetylated a - tubulin in infected cells increased beginning at 2 h p . i . , reached a maximum at 4 h p . i . , and slightly decreased at 6 h p . i . ( Fig . 3A ) . The kinetics of tubulin acetylation correlated well with the kinetics of Hsp90 upregulation , suggesting that Hsp90 might be involved in acetylation of a - tubulin . In addition , previous studies have demonstrated that Hsp90 binds MTs and is involved in the reorganization of the microtubular network [ 24 ] . Thus we tested the correlation between Hsp90 and tubulin ( Fig . 3B ) [ 25 ] . The colocalization of Hsp90 with acetylated a - tubulin and enhanced immunofluorescence were observed in HSV - 1 - infected cells while such colocalization was suppressed in the inhibitor - treated groups . Besides , Hsp90 inhibitors significantly decreased the level of acetylated a - tubulin beginning at 2 h p . i . ( Fig . 3C ) . Furthermore , co - IP experiment also demonstrated a reduced interaction between acetylated a - tubulin and Hsp90 in the presence of Hsp90 inhibitors ( Fig . 3D ) . Taken together , these results demon - strated that Hsp90 inhibitors suppressed the HSV - 1 - induced acetylation of a - tubulin , and the interaction of Hsp90 with MTs . Inhibition of Hsp90 Reduces Nuclear Transport and Expression of Viral Capsid Protein Considering that tubulin acetylation can stabilize microtubule and thereby promote viral nuclear translocation , it is easy to envision that Hsp90 inhibitors may interrupt HSV - 1 capsid protein ( e . g . ICP5 ) nuclear transport by reducing the acetylation of tubulin and its interaction with Hsp90 . To confirm the role of Hsp90 in nuclear transport of viral capsid protein , first we confirmed the subcellular localization of these proteins using laser scanning microscopy ( LSM ) ( Fig . 4A ) . At 4h p . i . , newly ICP5 has not been synthesised and thereby those ICP5 dots in the cytoplasm represent incoming virions . Compared with the viral control , in which ICP5 and Hsp90 were highly concentrated in nucleus , accumulation of Hsp90 in nucleus was reduced and Hsp90 formed punctate domains in the inhibitor - treated cells . In contrast , ICP5 was dispersed in the cytoplasm in the presence of inhibitors , suggesting that Hsp90 inhibition significantly prevented nuclear transport of viral capsid protein ICP5 . We also modulated Hsp90 expression by siRNA or overexpression to confirm the role of Hsp90 in ICP5 nuclear transport ( Fig . 4B ) . At 4h p . i . and 6h p . i . , ICP5 speckles were mostly enriched in nucleus in the viral control group , in contrast , no ICP5 speckles were observed in the nuclei of Figure 2 . HSV - 1 infection induces Hsp90 upregulation and nuclear translocation . ( A ) MRC - 5 cells were infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 10 ) for 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , or 6 h . The cells were then harvested , lysed , and analyzed for total Hsp90 expression . The Western blotting results shown in the line graph were normalized to GAPDH expression and were expressed as the fold increase relative to the cell control . Each value represents the mean 6 SD of three independent experiments .

( C ) Interaction between ICP5 and Hsp90 . Cells transfected with or without pEGFP - Hsp90 were lysed , immunoprecipitated with anti - Hsp90 antibody and probed with indicated antibodies .

Besides , at 6h p . i . , ICP5 was hard to detect in cells and might be degraded ( Fig . 4B ) . However , nuclear accumulation of ICP5 in the pEGFP - Hsp90 a transfection group was similar to that in the viral control group , suggesting overexpression of pEGFP - Hsp90 restored the ICP5 nuclear transport that was inhibited by BJ - B11 treatment .

A statistical analysis of the data showed that Hsp90 is significantly associated with efficient viral ICP5 nuclear transport . Those results indicated that Hsp90 promotes nuclear transport of viral capsid protein and inhibition of Hsp90 may lead to degradation of capsid protein . Then to confirm whether the chaperone activity of Hsp90 is required for viral capsid protein ICP5 expression , Hsp90 inhibitor 17 - AAG and BJ - B11 were used to treat HSV - 1 - infected cells , and the expression level of ICP5 and Hsp90 at different time points after infection was measured respectively ( Fig . 5A ) . During HSV - 1 infection , more and more virions entered cells and the level of ICP5 increased . Treating the infected cells with Hsp90 inhibitors significantly reduced the level of both ICP5 and Hsp90 beginning at 4 h p . i . Modulation of Hsp90 expression also affects ICP5 expression . As shown in Fig . 5B , Hsp90 knockdown by siRNA efficiently reduced Hsp90 expression level and significantly decreased the expression of ICP5 protein in infected cells . In addition , overexpression of Hsp90 protein can counteract the effect of Hsp90 inhibitors ( Fig . 5C ) . Overexpression of Hsp90 slightly enhanced the expression level of ICP5 at 4 h p . i . and restored ICP5 protein expression , which was decreased by BJ - B11 treatment , suggesting that Hsp90 is crucial for viral capsid protein expression . Hsp90 Inhibitors Inhibit ICP5 Nuclear Translocation of ACV - resistant Virus To monitor the effect of Hsp90 inhibitor treatment on the nuclear translocation of viral ICP5 protein , we observed the subcellular localization of the major viral capsid protein ICP5 ( Fig . 6A ) and calculated the percentage of ICP5 - positive nuclei ( Fig . 6B ) . At 4 h p . i . , the viral capsids were mostly enriched in the nucleus in the viral control group , but not in the presence of Hsp90 inhibitors , in which the ICP5 protein were still distributed in the cytoplasm . A statistical analysis of the data showed that the percentage of ICP5 - positive nuclei was approximately 70 % and 20 % for the viral control and the Hsp90 inhibitor - treated groups at 4 h p . i . , respectively . These results indicated that Hsp90 inhibitors suppress the ICP5 nuclear transport of the ACV - resistant HSV - 1 strain as well as the F strain during the early stage of infection . Discussion Previous studies have demonstrated that capsid nuclear transport of HSV - 1 was dependent on an intact microtubule network and cytoplamic dynein motor , as microtubule - disrupting drugs strongly reduced the transport of HSV - 1 capsids to the nucleus [ 21 ] . The HSV - 1 capsid protein VP26 [ 26 ] , the inner nuclear membrane protein pUL34 [ 27 ] , the tegument protein US11 [ 28 ] , and the helicase pUL9 [ 29 ] have been found to Figure 4 . Hsp90 plays a crucial role in ICP5 nuclear translocation . ( A ) Confocal images show capsid protein transport reduced by Hsp90 inhibition . MRC - 5 cells exposed to HSV - 1 ( MOI = 10 ) for 4 h under the treatment of Hsp90 inhibitor ( 0 . 8 m M ) were stained for ICP5 ( red ) , total Hsp90 ( green ) , and nuclei ( blue ) . ( B ) Hsp90 is important for capsid protein nuclear transport . Cell monolayers infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 10 ) for different times were stained for ICP5 ( red ) , total Hsp90 ( green ) , and nuclei ( blue ) . Five images per dish were acquired by LSM for counting of ICP5 docked in nuclear . The percentage of positive nuclei ( nuclei with ICP5 ) was calculated .

More recent research has indicated that HSV - 1 ICP5 , the major capsid protein can interact with the dynein light chain , although this putative interaction needs to be confirmed in infected cells [ 30 ] . Hsp90 is involved in nuclear localization , vRNP complex formation , and viral RNA synthesis within nucleus in other virus infection such as influenza virus infection [ 31 – 33 ] . Hsp90 may actively participate in multiple stages of HSV - 1 infection , including intracellular transport , nuclear translocation , and viral DNA replication within infected nucleus . It has been observed that Hsp90 chaperone system , including Hsp70 and Hsp40 , is necessary for HSV - 1 infection and helps to localize HSV - 1 DNA polymerase to the nucleus [ 34 ] , the mechanism by which Hsp90 involves in HSV - 1 nuclear transport remains unclear . In particular , Hsp90 and other molecular chaperones , such as Hsc70 , Hsp70 , and Hsp40 , are recruited to nuclear domains and may contribute to the promotion of viral protein folding and transport [ 35 ] . Hsp70 specifically binds to tubulin and other MT - associated proteins ( MAPs ) to enhance MT polymerization [ 36 ] . Another chaperone , Hsp27 , is also rapidly reorganized and modified in response to HSV - 1 infection . The subcellular localization of Hsp27 is similar to that of Hsp90 [ 37 ] , and Hsp27 also associates with the MT system [ 38 ] . These findings suggest that molecular chaperones play important roles in intracellular transport of HSV - 1 capsids . In the present study , we revealed that Hsp90 is required for nuclear transport of HSV - 1 capsid protein ICP5 . Hsp90 is rapidly induced in response to HSV - 1 infection and is then translocated into and enriched in the Figure 5 . Inhibition of Hsp90 reduces ICP5 expression . ( A ) MRC - 5 cells infected with HSV - 1 ( MOI = 10 ) for 1 , 2 , 4 , or 6 h in the presence of Hsp90 inhibitors ( 0 . 8 m M ) were harvested , lysed , and analyzed by Western blotting for ICP5 and total Hsp90 expression . The Western blotting results shown in the bar graph were normalized to GAPDH expression and were expressed as the fold increase relative to the cell control .

( C ) Overexpression of Hsp90 restores the expression level of ICP5 .

Simultaneously , HSV - 1 infection facilitates acety - lation of a - tubulin and upregulated Hsp90 is recruited to interact with acetylated a - tubulin . Treatment of Hsp90 inhibitors reduces virus - induced acetylation of a - tubulin , the interaction of Hsp90 - tubulin , and viral ICP5 nuclear transport . It has been reported that Hsp90 binds to tubulin and inhibits MT formation [ 39 ] . The interaction of Hsp90 with MTs depends on the level of tubulin acetylation , which also stimulates the binding and signaling functions of Hsp90 client proteins [ 25 ] . It has been reported that the HSV - 1 tegument protein VP22 can induce hyperacetylation and stabilization of MTs during both transfection and infection [ 40 ] , suggesting that VP22 is one of the viral inducers for stimulating the acetylation of a - tubulin . Tubulin acetylation is known to be regulated by HDAC6 , a class II histone deacetylase [ 41 ] . HDAC6 interacts with Hsp90 on MTs to form HDAC6 / heat shock factor 1 ( HSF1 ) / Hsp90 complex under unstressed condition [ 42 ] , and Hsp90 chaperone activity is regulated by reversible acetylation and controlled by HDAC6 [ 43 ] . Our results demonstrated that Hsp90 inhibition significantly reduces HSV - 1 - induced acetylation of tubulin , suggesting that Hsp90 activity is involved in the regulation of acetylation of tubulin during HSV - 1 infection . We can speculate that acetylated tubulin induced by HSV - 1 infection not only stabilizes MTs but is also important for strengthening the chaperone function of Hsp90 in the recruitment of viral capsids to MTs , thus facilitating viral capsid nuclear translocation . Moreover , we infer that HDAC6 plays an important role in regulating the interaction between Hsp90 and acetylated a - tubulin . The roles of HDAC6 and Hsp90 in HSV - 1 intracellular capsid translocation deserve further investigation to elucidate . Emergence of drug resistant strain is the main hurdles in the development of effective anti - HSV agents . Antiviral compounds that target viral proteins easily generate viral escape mutations , resulting in drug resistance [ 10 ] . Hsp90 is a host protein that is required for HSV - 1 replication and the inhibitors of Hsp90 is generally considered to present a low risk of generating drug - resistant viruses . Additionally , the role of Hsp90 in inflammation and cellular innate immune defense pathways make this protein a promising target for an antiviral approach [ 44 ] . Hsp90 regulates the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 and TBK - 1 stabilization to facilitate Sendai virus infection [ 45 ] and plays a role in antigen cross - presentation during lymphocytic choriomen - ingitis virus infection [ 46 ] . In agreement with the findings of previous reports regarding the anti - HSV activity of GA [ 12 ] , in the current study , the Hsp90 inhibitors BJ - B11 and 17 - AAG presented significant antiviral activity against HSV - 1 , with IC 50 values less than that of ACV . Previously GA has been demonstrated to inhibit viral replication , release , and restore the cell cycle . However , specific role of Hsp90 in HSV - 1 early infection and whether GA has an antiviral effect during HSV - 1 early infection have not been illuminated . Herein , our results show that Hsp90 plays a critical role in viral capsid protein translocation and novel Hsp90 inhibitor BJ - B11 exhibits potent antiviral effect by reducing viral nuclear transport . In conclusion , we are the first to reveal that Hsp90 , by interacting with acetylated a - tubulin , plays a crucial role in promoting viral nuclear transport . Hsp90 inhibitors suppressed drug - resistant HSV - 1 replication by interfering with the interac - tion between Hsp90 and a - tubulin , thereby inhibiting capsid nuclear translocation and replication . The present study provides novel insight into the mechanism by which Hsp90 mediates viral capsids nuclear translocation and into the anti - HSV mechanism of Hsp90 inhibitors .
