Human Plastin Genes COMPARATIVE GENE STRUCTURE , CHROMOSOME LOCATION , AND DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION IN NORMAL AND NEOPLASTIC CELLS * ( Received for publication , September 9 , 1992 ) Ching - Shwun Lin $ , Taesun Park $ , Zong Ping Chen $ , and John Leavitt $ $ l [ From the $ Laboratory of Cancer Cell Biology , Palo Alto Medical Foundation Research Institute , Palo Alto , California 94301 and SAdeza Biomedical , Sunnyuale , California 94089 Plastins are a family of actin - binding proteins that are conserved throughout eukaryote evolution and ex - pressed in most tissues of higher eukaryotes . In hu - mans , two ubiquitous plastin isoforms ( L and T ) have been identified . The L isoform is expressed only in hemopoietic cell lineages , while the T isoform has been found in all other normal cells of solid tissues that have replicative potential ( fibroblasts , endothelial cells , ep - ithelial cells , melanocytes , etc . ) . However , L - plastin has been found in many types of malignant human cells of non - hemopoietic origin suggesting that its expres - sion is induced accompanying tumorigenesis in solid tissues . To learn more about the nature of plastin genes and their potential role in malignancy , the L - and T - plastin genes were cloned and sequenced to character - ize their structure and mechanisms of regulation of expression . Each gene was found to be approximately 90 kilobases in size and was composed of 16 exons . All exon - intron junction sequences were identified and shown to conform to the canonical junction sequences . It was evident from their similar structure and coding homology that the two plastin genes have diverged from a common ancestor gene . L - and T - plastin genes were also mapped to chromosomes 13 and X , respec - tively , using polymerase chain reaction amplification with isoform - specific probes . An expanded survey of normal cell types and 50 tumor cell lines , demonstrated that 68 % of carcinomas and 53 % of other solid tumors of nonepithelial origin exhibited L - plastin expression , whereas the normal stem cell progenitors did not . Fi - brosarcomas ( n = 4 ) , ovarian carcinomas ( n = g ) , breast carcinomas ( n = 4 ) , and choriocarcinomas ( n = 2 ) com - bined exhibited the highest frequency and levels of L - plastin expression ( 95 % frequency ) . In addition , 4 tu - mor cell lines that were L - plastin - negative exhibited evidence of defective T - plastin expression increasing the apparent co - incidence of plastin abnormalities as - sociated with human tumorigenesis to 71 % . Evidence is presented in support of a trans - activation mecha - nism for activation of L - plastin synthesis accompany - ing tumorigenesis . The induction of L - plastin expres - sion accompanying SV40 - mediated transformation of human embryonic lung MRC - 5 fibroblasts was also confirmed . Finally , we present evidence that fimbrin * This work was supported by United States Public Health Service Grants CA34763 and CA49423 ( to J . L . and C . 3 . L . ) .

Actin - containing microfilaments of non - muscle cells are the most abundant space - filling architectural component of the cytoplasm ( 1 ) . Functionally , microfilaments have been implicated in intracellular movement of organelles , cytoki - nesis , and cell motility ( 2 ) . Dramatic rearrangement of cyto - skeletal microfilaments accompanies neoplastic transforma - tion ( 3 , 4 ) and this reorganization is associated with both qualitative and quantitative changes in the expression of the proteins that form microfilaments such as actins and tropo - myosins ( 5 - 16 ) . In addition , oncogenes have been identified that contain actin and tropomyosin domains ( 17 - 19 ) , and actin mutations or inactivation of actin gene alleles have been found in tumor - derived cell lines ( 6 , 13 , 15 ) . The universal association of microfilament rearrangement accompanying malignant transformation is indicative of a fundamental re - lationship between the architectural properties of a cell and neoplastic or malignant potential . Therefore , the processes that govern these transformation - linked changes in microfil - ament organization are of interest for elucidation of a full understanding of the neoplastic transformation process . An additional class of abundant cytoplasmic proteins , known generally as actin - binding proteins , participates in organization of actin microfilaments by their ability to cross - link actin filaments into ( i ) bundles which provide structural support for finger - like extensions of the plasma membrane ( microvilli , stereocilia , and filopodia ) and ( ii ) gels consisting of an orthogonal lattice arrangement of filaments which com - pose the subcortical scaffold associated with the plasma mem - brane ( 20 ) . Recently , we defined a new family of actin - binding proteins called plastins ( or fimbrins ) which are differentially expressed in normal tissues and malignant tumor cells ( 21 - 23 ) . One member of this family , L - plastin , was first noted as a polypeptide which appeared to be induced accompanying tumorigenesis of human fibroblasts ( 5 , 24 , 25 ) . We later demonstrated that plastins were a family of at least two cytoplasmic 70 - kDa polypeptide isoforms related to the actin - bundling protein fimbrin ( 21 - 23 ) . Recently , a plastin homolog was identified in yeast ( 26 ) , indicating that plastins are con - served throughout eukaryote evolution . The two ubiquitous isoforms that were identified in humans were expressed in a contrasting manner between cells of the hemopoietic lineages and other cells of solid tissues ( 23 , 25 ) . Constitutive expres - sion of the L - plastin isoform was found to be restricted to replicative hemopoietic cells while constitutive expression of T - plastin appeared to be a property of other replicative cells of solid tissues such as fibroblasts , endothelial cells , and 2781 2782 Human Plastin Genes epithelial cells . However , many different types of human tumor - derived cell lines ( non - hemopoietic cell types ) were found to synthesize both L - plastin and T - plastin together , suggesting that the L - plastin gene was activated constitutively accompanying tumorigenesis ( 21 , 23 ) . One approach to a better understanding of the plastin gene family and the dynamics of its regulation in cancer and cell differentiation requires isolation and characterization of its genes . As a prerequisite to understanding the full scope of the involvement of plastins in normal and neoplastic cell behav - ior , we cloned and characterized the human L - and T - plastin genes and mapped them to chromosomes 13 and X , respec - tively . Comparison of the two gene structures led us to con - clude that they diverged from a common ancestor gene re - sulting in separate single - copy genes which encoded plastins with potentially different functions and control mechanisms of expression . We expanded our survey of normal cell types and human tumor cell types for expression of plastin isoforms and present evidence that fimbrin is a third distinct tissue - specific isoform of this protein family . The results of this survey indicate that activation of L - plastin expression or reduction in T - plastin expression is a frequent event in non - hemopoietic cell tumorigenesis ( approximately 71 % ) and that activation of L - plastin expression accompanying tumorigen - esis is most likely due to trans - activation of both iso - alleles . In the accompanying paper ( 27 ) , we explore the potential regulatory mechanisms that control the activity of the L - plastin promoter . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Cultures - The HUT - 14 , HOS , and HT1080 have been de - scribed previously ( 5 , 12 ) . The HUT series of cell lines ( 4 , 5 ) were derived from the human fibrosarcoma cell line 8387 ( 28 ) . The source of all other cell lines is identified in Table IV . All cell types were cultured in minimal essential - a medium , or the recommended cultur - ing medium of the supplier , supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and antibiotics ( 5 ) . Isolation of Genomic Clones - A X - EMBL3 genomic library was constructed from DNA of normal human leukocytes and kindly given to us by Dr . Bob Wade ( Stanford University ) . This library was screened with 32P - labeled plastin cDNA probes by standard proce - dures ( 29 , 30 ) . Positive clones were purified , followed by the isolation of their DNAs , and subcloning of the genomic inserts into Bluescript and M13 plasmids . Regions containing plastin cDNA sequences were identified by Southern blot and DNA sequence analyses . Cloning of the 3‘ - End Plastin cDNAs by Reverse Transcriptase - PCR’“Ce1lular RNA was prepared from cultured cells by standard methods ( 29 , 30 ) . For reverse transcription , 100 ng of an oligo ( 5’ - GACTCGAGTCGACATCGATI7 ) was annealed to 50 ng of HUT - 14 poly ( A + ) RNA and extended by Superscript reverse transcriptase ( Bethesda Research Laboratories ) in a reaction volume of 20 pl ( 22 ) . A portion ( 1 / 20 ) of the cDNA was used in PCR which included 100 ng of an oligo ( same sequence as above but without T17 ) as the downstream primer and 100 ng of either an L - or T - plastin oligo as the upstream primer ( L - plastin , 5”CTATAAAAGCTTTCTGCC ; T - plastin , 5”GTAATAGAAGCTTTTCTTAT ) in a reaction volume of 100 pl containing 2 . 5 units of Amplitaq ( Perkin - Elmer Cetus ) , and buffer supplemented with 1 . 5 mM of MgC1 , and 0 . 2 mM deoxynucleo - tide triphosphates prepared according to the formula recommended by the supplier of Amplitaq . The PCR was run in an Ericomp thermocycler for 35 cycles with each cycle consisting of 94 “C , 30 s ; 55 “C , 30 s ; 72 “C , 2 min . After an additional 5 - min incubation at 72 “C , the PCR mixture was concentrated by ethanol precipitation and electrophoresed in an agarose gel . A single DNA band of 650 and 580 bp for L - and T - plastin , respectively , was identified and purified . After HindIIIISalI digestion ( Hind111 site in the plastin oligos and Sal1 site in the downstream primer ) , both L - and T - plastin PCR cDNAs were cloned into M13 and sequenced . The abbreviations used are : PCR , polymerase chain reaction ; bp , base pair ; 2 - D , two - dimensional ; kb , kilobase pairs ; UTR , untrans - lated region . Chromosome Mapping by PCR - A “PCRable Gene Mapping” kit ( Bios Inc . , New Haven , CT ) containing genomic DNA samples puri - fied from 18 different human / hamster hybrid cell lines and from control human and hamster cell lines was used to identify the human chromosomes harboring the L - and T - plastin genes . Pairs of human L - and T - plastin gene - specific oligonucleotide primers were designed to consist of 20 nucleotides each with approximately equal numbers of pyrimidines and purines . The human L - plastin gene upstream primer was 5’ - GCCTTGCTATCTAGAATCGA - 3’ which is repre - sentative of a sequence 220 nucleotides upstream from the gene promoter TATA sequence , and the human L - plastin gene downstream primer was 5’ - TTCTGATCTGCAGAACAGCT - 3’ which is repre - sentative of a sequence located within the 5”untranslated region of the L - plastin gene and messenger RNA ( 22 ) . The human T - plastin gene upstream primer was 5’ - CTGCTTTCCTCAGTAGTGCA - 3’ representing a sequence located within the second intron of the T - plastin gene , and the T - plastin gene downstream primer was 5’ - TATTCCTGTCACCATCCAGC - 3’ which represents a sequence lo - cated within the third exon of the T - plastin gene . Each PCR reaction ( 0 . 1 ml ) contained 500 ng of each hybrid cell DNA , 100 ng of each primer ( DNA ) pair , in addition to the standard reaction components described in the preceding methods section . The amplification reactions were run for 35 cycles with each cycle con - sisting of 94 and 55 “C or 58 “C ( for L - or T - plastin primers , respec - tively ) , and 72 “C steps for 30 s each . After an additional 5 - min incubation at 72 “C , a 3O - gl portion of each sample was electropho - resed in a 1 . 6 % agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and photo - graphed . PCR products from the control human DNA were made into single - stranded DNAs and sequenced as follows . After gel electrophoresis , each DNA band was cut out and purified by the Geneclean procedure ( kit purchased from Bio 101 Inc . , La Jolla , CA ) . The purified DNA sample was divided into two portions , each mixed with the above - mentioned PCR components replacing the 100 - ng primer pair with 300 ng of only one of the primers . After 25 cycles of reactions in the thermocycler with the same temperature steps and durations as mentioned above , the reaction mixture was concentrated by ethanol precipitation and electrophoresed in a 1 . 6 % gel . Each DNA band was isolated and purified with the Geneclean procedure , annealed to the primer whose counterpart was used in the single - stranded PCR reaction , and sequenced by the standard procedure . Labeling , 2 - 0 Gel Electrophoresis , and Cellular Proteins - All cell types in high - density subconfluent monolayers were labeled for 4 h with [ 35S ] methionine and samples were prepared for electrophoresis as previously described ( 14 , 15 , 31 ) . Two - dimensional gels were also produced and analyzed as previously described ( 14 , 15 , 31 ) . Western blotting of polypeptides separated in 2 - D gels has been described previously ( 23 , 32 ) . Rabbit anti - @ - galactosidase used at 1 / 500 dilution was purchase from Clontech ( Palo Alto , CA ) . Rabbit anti - fimbrin ( 23 ) used at 1 : lOOO dilution was a gift from Paul Matsudaira ( White - head Institute , MIT ) . RESULTS Isolation of L - and T - plastin Genes and Comparison of Their Structures - By using L - and T - plastin cDNA probes we isolated clones from a human genomic library prepared from lymphocyte DNA . DNA inserts in the genomic clones were analyzed by restriction digestions and exon - containing frag - ments were identified by Southern blotting with the two cDNA probes . Clones designated pg305 , pg316 , pg108 , pg612 , pg608 , pglll , and pg105 , and clones designated pg401 , pg201 , pg205 , pg904 , pg518s , and pg501 ( Fig . 1 ) were found to rep - resent the entire L - and T - plastin genes , respectively , with the exception of an uncloned gap in intron 1 which corre - sponds to DNA linking the genomic sequences in pg401 and pg201 of the T - plastin gene . The sequences at all intron - exon junctions were determined either by sequencing the entire exon - containing genomic DNA fragments or by sequencing DNA across the exon - intron junctions using cDNA sequence - specific oligonucleotides as sequencing primers . The sizes of introns were determined by a combination of restriction en - zyme mapping , sequencing , and PCR sizing ( with pairs of oligo primers whose sequences were derived from neighboring exons ) .

Except for the first exons , the locations of all exon - intron junctions within the coding sequences were identical between the two genes as determined by their aligned cDNA sequences ( Fig . 2B ) . Both first exons of the L - and T - plastin genes contained 5’ - UTR sequences only and both protein coding regions began in exon 2 and ended in exon 16 which also contained the entire 3’ - UTR sequences . The predicted functional domains of the plastin polypep - tides were encoded in multiple exon compartments ( Fig . 2B ) . For example , the protease - sensitive headpiece ( amino acids 1 to 111 for L - and T - plastin ; Ref . 23 ) was encoded by exons 2 , 3 , and 4 . Also , both calcium - binding domains and most of the flanking a - helices ( amino acids 24 to 83 ; Ref . 23 ) were encoded in exon 3 , but the N - terminal edge of the flanking a - helix for the first calcium - binding domain was encoded in exon 2 I II I II Ill I I I IIII IIII Q M A I B I N I B ] hcldpkcc m 1kb FIG . 2 .

Vertical lines indicate junctions between neighboring exons whose numbers are given above . The illustration beneath the cDNAs represents the primary structure of either L - or T - plastin polypeptide with the two vertical bars representing the two calcium - binding domains in the headpiece and the four boxes ( A , B , A’ , B’ ) representing the repetitive actin - binding domains in the core ( 23 ) . ( amino acids 11 to 23 ; Ref . 23 ) . Finally , contiguous portions of the partially conserved sequence ( found in other actin - binding proteins ) implicated as the core of the N - terminal actin - binding domain ( amino acids 132 to 225 ; Ref . 23 ) were encoded in exons 5 , 6 , and 7 , and portions of the second partially conserved sequence implicated as the core of the C - terminal actin - binding domain ( amino acids 399 to 481 ; Ref . 23 ) were encoded in exons 11 , 12 , and 13 . The genomic clones of the L - and T - plastin genes contain - ing exon 16 were sequenced beyond the coding termination signal to identify the transcription termination signals ( Fig . 3 ) . For determination of the transcription termination sites of both genes , it was necessary to compare their genomic sequences with cDNAs having the complete 3”ends . The L - and T - plastin cDNA clones that were isolated from an HuT - 14 library ( designated P107 and P4 , respectively ; Ref . 21 ) contained 1213 and 1085 bp of plastin cDNA sequences , respectively , after the translation termination codon , but did not contain poly ( A ) tails . Comparison between L - plastin cDNA 3‘ - end and exon 16 genomic sequences indicated that the incompleteness of the L - plastin cDNA was probably due to truncation at an EcoRI site that occurred during construc - tion of the cDNA library ( 16 , 21 ) . The T - plastin cDNA contained two polyadenylation signal sequences ( AATAAA ) near its 3’ - end , indicating that a poly ( A ) tail was not far from this 3‘ - end . An reverse transcriptase - PCR procedure was used to clone L - and T - plastin cDNAs with poly ( A ) tails . This approach employed a poly ( T ) tail - containing oligonucleotide as the primer for reverse transcription , a similar oligonucleotide ( without the poly ( T ) tail ) as the downstream PCR primer , and an L - or T - plastin specific oligonucleotide as the up - stream PCR primer ( see “Materials and Methods” ) . The L - and T - plastin oligomer sequences were located 150 and 565 Human Plastin Genes 2785 . . .

Comparison of L - and T - plastin gene exon 16 se - quences . The L - and T - plastin nucleotide sequences are aligned for maximal homology in the region encoding the C - terminal amino acids . Numbering of the nucleotide sequences for exon 16 of both the L - and T - plastin genes is based on counting from the most 5’ transcrip - tion initiation site , nucleotide 1 in exon 1 of the L - plastin gene ( see accompanying paper , Ref . 27 ) . Numbering of the amino acid sequence is identical to previous report ( 22 , 23 ) . bases , respectively , upstream from the 3’ - end of their respec - tive existing cDNAs ; these sequences were chosen because they each contained a Hind111 site for cloning . The resulting PCR products were approximately 650 and 580 bp in size for L - and T - plastin , respectively . Sequencing of these amplifi - cation products revealed that their sequences faithfully over - lapped with the respective existing cDNA sequences derived from the initial cDNA clones ( 21 ) and were identical to the respective genomic sequences which were derived from pglll and pg105 for L - plastin , and from pg518s and pg501 for T - plastin ( Fig . 1 , Tables I and 11 ) . The L - plastin PCR cDNA contained an EcoRI site that corresponded to the end of the original cDNA ( 4 ) and to the single EcoRI site in exon 16 ( Fig . 3 ) . It also contained two polyadenylation signal se - quences followed by a poly ( A ) tail . For T - plastin , the PCR cDNA extended the existing cDNA by 11 base pairs followed by a poly ( A ) tail . These results indicated that the L - and T - plastin PCR cDNAs represent the complete 3’ - ends of their respective mRNAs and that the 16th exon of both the L - and T - plastin genes contained the transcription termination site . The L - plastin 3’ - UTR sequence was 562 nucleotides longer than the T - plastin 3’ - UTR sequence consistent with the larger length of the L - plastin mRNA ( 21 ) . Comparison of the two 3’ - UTR sequences in exon 16 ( Fig . 3 ) indicated that these regions of the two genes were completely unrelated , the 3’ - UTR of the T - plastin having a more AT - rich ( 65 % ) sequence than that of the L - plastin gene ( 55 % ) because it contained 11 stretches of poly ( AT ) - rich sequences randomly dispersed throughout the 3’ - UTR . The 5“untranslated sequences of exon 1 and sequences surrounding the promoter and upstream flanking sequences were also found to be unrelated ( 27 ) . * For example , the L - plastin gene contained a classic TATAAA sequence , four potential cis - acting response elements for Ets , which regulates lymphoid - specific gene expression , and three potential steroid receptor - response elements while none of these sequence ele - ments were found in the promoter region of the T - plastin gene ( data not shown ) . The sequence and activity of the L - plastin promoter is characterized in the accompanying paper ( 27 ) . Chromosome Location of the L - and T - plastin Genes - By using human / hamster hybrid cell lines which contained dif - ferent but overlapping sets of human chromosomes ( Table 111 ) , the L - and T - plastin genes were mapped to their respec - tive chromosomes with the PCR method ( see “Materials and Methods” ) . The L - plastin gene amplification reactions with genomic DNAs prepared from cells which contained an iden - tifiable human chromosome 13 ( i . e . a human cell line and human / hamster hybrid cell lines Nos . 867 , 1006 , 968 , 750 , and 1099 ) exhibited a band of amplified DNA of the expected size of 340 bp while none of the other DNAs showed any discernable bands ( Fig . 4 , panel L ) . DNA from one additional hybrid cell line ( 756 ) which also contained an identifiable human chromosome 13 also generated the same 340 - bp am - plification product ( data not shown ) . The amplification prod - uct from the human cell line was sequenced and found to be identical to the L - plastin gene sequence determined from X - phage genomic clones pg305 and pg316 ( Fig . 1 ) . These results clearly demonstrated that the L - plastin gene was located on human chromosome 13 , and confirmed the assignment of the L - plastin gene to chromosome 13 based previously upon an allele segregation analysis ( 34 ) . T - plastin gene amplification reactions indicated that all genomic DNAs prepared from cells with human chromosome X ( ie . a human cell line and cell lines 803 , 909 , and 968 ) exhibited an amplified band of the expected size of 720 base pairs and an unexpected minor band of 520 base pairs ( Fig . 4 , panel T ) . Cell lines 803 and 909 also exhibited an additional unexpected minor band of 710 bp . But none of the 16 remain - ing genomic DNA samples prepared from cells lacking an identifiable human chromosome X generated a recognizable PCR amplification product . The fact that the unexpected minor bands were smaller in size than the expected 720 - bp band and were amplified at a lesser rate suggested that they were amplified products from other regions of chromosome X that shared sequence homology with the intended target . Again , the 720 - bp amplification product from the human cell line was sequenced and found to be identical to the corre - sponding T - plastin gene sequence determined from X - phage genomic clone pg201 ( Fig . 1 ) . These results establish that the T - plastin gene was located on human chromosome X . A 1 - kb region at the beginning of the first intron of the T - plastin gene was found to contain an unusually high number of CG dinucleotides ( not shown ) which are potential sites for meth - ylation and a common feature of genes on chromosome X . Such potential methylation sites might be involved in the inactivation of one of the two T - plastin alleles in somatic cells of females which are known to have only one functioning X chromosome .

Lanes m are 123 - bp DNA size ladders . Cell Types - An expanded survey of normal and neoplastic human and rodent cell types from adult blood , fetal tissues , and adult solid tissues is presented in Table IV . Previously published results using 2 - D gel profiling and Northern blot - ting with plastin isoform - specific probes are also cited in Table IV along with the sources of all of the cell lines and strains . In 39 instances where both 2 - D gel analysis and Northern analysis were both performed on the same cells , there was 100 % agreement between these two methods of assay . Plastin expression was examined by detection of the polypeptide isoforms using high resolution 2 - D gel electro - phoresis of total cellular proteins as shown in Fig . 5 or isoform - specific mRNA using Northern blotting ( plastin iso - forms are easily detectable in 2 - D gels either by Coomassie Blue or silver staining or by metabolically labeling with [ 35S ] methionine and autoradiography ; Refs . 21 and 25 ) . In some cases plastin isoform expression was confirmed by Western blotting with anti - fimbrin antibody ( 23 ) or polypeptide mi - crosequencing ( 21 , 22 ) . Fig . 5A shows the 2 - D gel electropho - retic protein profile of the SV4O - transformed cell line , MRC - 5 - SV2 , which exhibits L - plastin synthesis in addition to T - plastin expression . The plastin profile of this cell line was compared to that of the untransformed parental strain , MRC - 5 embryonic lung fibroblasts , and the CEM lymphoblastoid cell line by Western blotting of the 2 - D gel protein pattern ( Fig . 5 , B - D , respectively ) using anti - plastin antibody pre - pared by immunization with chick fimbrin ( 23 ) . These ex - amples serve to illustrate the three modes of plastin isoform expression observed during the survey : ( i ) transformed cell types which expressed both L - and T - plastin isoforms ( MRC - 5 - SV2 ; Fig . 5 , A and B ) , ( ii ) normal non - hemopoietic cell types which expressed only T - plastin isoforms ( MRC - 5 ; Fig . 5C ) , and hemopoietic cell types which expressed only L - plastin ( CEM ; Fig . 5D ) . By contrast with human fibrosarcoma strains derived from natural tumors that expressed L - plastin abundantly ( 12 , 21 ) , four out of five independent SV40 - transformed human fibroblast cell lines did not synthesize detectable levels of L - plastin ( Table IV ) ; nevertheless , the initial report of L - plastin induction in one SV4O - transformed fibroblast line ( 35 ) was confirmed using both 2 - D gel Western blot analysis ( Fig . 5 ) and Northern blot analysis ( not shown ) . Among the normal human cell types , unfractionated pe - ripheral blood leukocytes and four purified subpopulations , B - and T - lymphocytes , granulocytes , natural killer cells , and monocytes expressed L - plastin at abundant levels , but these cell types did not express T - plastin at levels detectable either by 2 - D gel analysis or Northern blotting analysis ( 21 , 25 , 34 , Human Plastin Genes 2787 TABLE IV Screening results Screening Method Cell type Source of cells ( addresses Prior L - plastin T - plastin Protein mRNA listed below ) " of result assay assay ( 2 - D gels ) ( Northern blot ) ( Ref . ) Normal human cells Adult blood cells Peripheral blood leukocytes B - Lymphocytes T - Lymphocytes Granulocytes Natural killer cells Monocytes / macrophages Red blood cells Platelets Normal fetal solid tissues Amnion epithelial cells Umbilical cord endothelial cells Embryonic lung fibroblasts Wi38 Wi26 MRC - 5 Normal adult solid tissues Aortic smooth muscle cells ( 1 Brain astrocytes ( 1 strain ) Colon mucosa epithelial cells ( 1 strain ) Eye trabecular meshwork endo - thelial cells ( 1 strain ) strain ) Jonff HFF BC KD R17 Gingival fibroblasts Mammary epithelial cells ( 3 strains ) Skin fibroblasts GM1142 GM1492 GM3552 9 strains ( from ataxia telangi - ectasia patients ) Skin keratinocytes ( 1 strain ) Skin melanocytes ( 1 strain ) Human cancer cells Hematopoietic origin B - Leukemia AG1484 GM6991 Jurkat GM607 GM09923B GM03299A T cell leukemia CEM Molt - 4 Promyelocytic leukemia Solid tissue origin Bladder carcinoma Cervical carcinoma HL - 60 T24 C - 33A HeLa HT - 3 BeWo JAR JEG CaCo - 2 WiDr Choriocarcinoma Colon carcinoma HT - 29 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + ND + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + ND ND + ND + + + ND ND + + ND ND ND ND ND ND ND ND ND + ND + ND ND + ND ND ND + + ND + ND ND + ND ND ND + + ND ND ND ND + + ND + ND + + + + + + + ND 9 co - workers Julie Djeu Julie Djeu Julie Djeu Julie Djeu Julie Djeu 9 co - workers Julie Djeu Julio Celis , Ref . 35 Clonetics , Inc .

Red blood cells and platelets did not exhibit detectable levels of either isoform . L - plastin , but not T - plastin , was detected at its usual abundance for hemopoietic cells in mouse macrophages collected by lung lavage using [ 35S ] methionine - labeled macrophage proteins assayed by 2 - D gel analysis . By contrast , normal purified cell types from fetal or adult human tissues including endothelial cells , epithelial cells , fibroblasts , keratinocytes , melanocytes , and late passage uterine stromal cells exhibited only T - plastin expression . Normal mouse skin fibroblasts and Syrian hamster embryonic cells in culture exhibited T - plastin expression , but not L - plastin expression . Fifty - nine human tumor - derived cell lines and strains and several transformed rodent cell lines were examined ( Table IV ) . This survey included 9 leukemias , 35 carcinomas , 12 sarcomas , or fibrosarcomas , 1 melanoma , and 3 retinoblasto - mas . Cell lines from 3 B cell leukemias , 2 T cell leukemias , and 1 promyelocytic leukemia abundantly expressed L - plas - tin , but these hemopoietic cell lines did not express T - plastin . Twenty - one out of the 32 individual carcinoma cell lines ( 66 % ) expressed L - plastin at varying levels while each carci - noma strain expressed a relatively constant amount of T - plastin except for the endometrial carcinoma strain ENDCA , which exhibited greatly reduced levels of T - plastin mRNA by comparison with the other carcinoma cell lines . Eight of nine ovarian carcinomas and all four mammary carcinomas ex - pressed abundant levels of L - plastin mRNA or protein while all three endometrial carcinoma cell lines failed to express detectable levels of L - plastin . All four unrelated fibrosarcoma cell lines and a total of 8 out of 15 ( 53 % ) nonepithelial tumors consisting of fibrosarcomas , sarcomas , retinoblastomas , and a melanoma also expressed L - plastin . All nine of the various transformed rodent cell lines failed to exhibit L - plastin expression . In contrast to the human hemopoietic tumor cell lines , the mouse myeloma cell line AG8 . 654 expressed no detectable L - plastin . L - plastin was detected only in mouse macrophages that were collected by lung lavage . Evidence for Activation of Both Zso - alleles of the L - plastin Gene - We assessed the possibility that the L - plastin gene was activated during tumorigenesis because of the occurrence of cis - mutations or rearrangements affecting the upstream regulatory elements . Hind111 digests of total genomic DNA from 12 solid tumor - derived cell lines that expressed L - plastin abundantly were probed in Southern blots with a 6 - kb HindIII - Hind111 genomic fragment spanning the TATAAA box ( isolated from genomic clone pg305 , Fig . U ) . All cell lines exhibited a single 6 - kb hybridized band which was indistinguishable from the 6 - kb HindIII - Hind111 genomic re - striction fragment of normal cells ( not shown ) . This result indicated that there was not gross rearrangement of potential regulatory DNA associated with the activation of the L - plastin gene . Previously , we and others reported that L - plastin expressed in white blood cells was polymorphic in charge in a minority of the human population ( 25 , 34 ) . This protein polymorphism was identifiable in 2 - D gel electrophoretic patterns of white blood cells since the normal L - plastin polypeptide and its phosphorylated derivative ( PI 5 . 3 , M , 68 , 000 ) split into two equally abundant charge species with the new variant resolv - ing at an isoelectric point approximately one charge unit more basic . The variant polypeptide also exhibited a slightly faster migration rate in the SDS dimension of the 2 - D gel . The appearance of this electrophoretic variant was found in about 5 % of the human population and appears to be due to a mutation of one or both allelic genes encoding L - plastin ( 25 , 34 ) . 2 The high frequency of occurrence of this polymorphism 2790 Human Plastin Genes FIG . 5 .

The smaller arrow in panels B , C , and D indicated the position of a cross - reactive polypeptide spot which may be a - actin in which is known to contain a domain that is conserved with the plastin sequence . The polypeptide identified as “70” ( arrow ) in panel A is the 70 - kDa cognate heat - shock protein ( 21 ) . suggested that the less frequent variant would be detected in some non - hemopoietic tumors that exhibited induction of L - plastin . If cis - acting mutations cause the activation of L - plastin expression , then it is likely that the activation of only one allelic L - plastin gene leads to expression of only one electrophoretic species of L - plastin in tumors that contain the dimorphic alleles . Conversely , if activation of L - plastin expression was due to a trans - activation mechanism , then expression of both electrophoretic variants of L - plastin would be predicted in the tumors of individuals who carry the genes for both electrophoretic species . In the survey in Table IV , three out of nine of the human lymphoblastoid cell lines expressed the polymorphic variant and one out of nine prep - arations of peripheral blood leukocytes from different individ - uals expressed the polymorphic variant . We , therefore , searched for non - hemopoietic tumors that exhibited expression of the less frequent electrophoretic var - iant of L - plastin and found that one out of 17 non - hemopoi - etic cell lines ( in which L - plastin synthesis was detected by 2 - D gel electrophoresis ) expressed the L - plastin polymorphic variant . This dimorphism was evident in two cell lines derived from the same choriocarcinoma , BeWo and JEG ( Table IV ) , which synthesized both electrophoretic variants in nearly equal amounts . Fig . 6 shows the [ 35S ] methionine - labeled L - plastin and T - plastin polypeptides synthesized by an addi - tional unrelated choriocarcinoma cell line JAR ( Fig . 6A ) which synthesized the usual charge species for L - plastin ( dem - onstrated in Fig . 5 ) , and by the JEG cell line ( Fig . 6C ) which synthesized the dimorphic forms of L - plastin reported previ - ously in leukocytes ( 25 , 34 ) . The identity of the L - and T - plastins in JAR and dimorphic L - and T - plastins in JEG was confirmed by 2 - D gel Western blotting ( Fig . 6 , B and D , respectively ) . The dimorphic forms of L - plastin in JEG were f I FIG . 6 .

Unfractionated [ RsS ] methionine - labeled polypeptides were separated by 2 - D gel electrophoresis and electrophoetically transferred to nitro - cellulose . The pattern of radioactive proteins was observed by auto - radiography . The positions of plastin polypeptides are indicated with arrows : A , autoradiographic pattern of JAR proteins between 80 and 50 kDa and PI 5 . 0 and 5 . 5 with the plastin polypeptides identified ; R , the positions of the same plastin isoforms shown in panel A after Western blotting with anti - fimbrin antibody ( 23 ) in which L - plastin ( “L” ) and the T - plastins ( “7”‘ ) are identified ; C , autoradiographic pattern of JEG proteins between 80 and 50 kDa and PI 5 . 0 and 5 . 5 with the plastin polypeptides identified ; and D , the positions of the same plastin isoforms shown in panel C after Western blotting with anti - fimbrin antibody in which the two L - plastin species ( “L” ) and the T - plastins ( “7”‘ ) are identified . In the electrophoretic pattern of JEG proteins the L - plastin polypeptide to the left is the most common dimorphic form in humans and the L - plastin polypeptide to the right the less common variant ( also see Refs . 25 and 34 ) . The uertical streaks in the Western blots are due to a cross - reaction of the anti - fimbrin antibody with certain keratin isoforms found only in some epithelial cell types . No such cross - reactions were observed when proteins of fibroblast cells or lymphocyte cells were blotted as in Fig . 5 , or when proteins of a squamous cell carcinoma were blotted ( 23 ) . indistinguishable electrophoretically from the two L - plastin species found in leukocytes and the related cell line BeWo . The co - expression of both allelic forms of L - plastin in this trophoblast tumor indicates that L - plastin expression was activated by a trans - acting mechanism that acts upon the two allelic genes encoding each dimorphic form of L - plastin . Re - sults presented in the accompanying paper ( 27 ) support this conclusion . They demonstrate that a recombinant L - plastin promoter cloned out of a normal lymphocyte genomic library can be active in neoplastic cells that exhibit active L - plastin expression from the endogenous genes ; by contrast , the L - plastin recombinant promoter was found to be relatively inactive in normal and neoplastic cells that did not exhibit L - plastin synthesis from the endogenous genes . Comparison of L - and T - plastin Expression with Fimbrin Expression in Selected Organs of the Rat - The plastin hom - olog , fimbrin , isolated from the chick intestinal brush border epithelium , differs substantially from human L - and T - plastin in amino acid sequence ( 30 and 28 % , respectively ; Ref . 23 ) . Since fimbrin has been characterized in a non - mammalian species , we could not conclude that it is a third plastin isoform based upon lack of amino acid sequence homology . However , if fimbrin is indeed a third isoform , it might exhibit a distinc - tive tissue distribution of synthesis as predicted for L - and T - plastin based upon the expression survey in normal cell types presented in Table IV . Therefore , the relationship of fimbrin to L - and T - plastin was assessed by examining the tissue distribution of mRNA encoding each of the three isoforms using a panel of RNAs prepared from eight rat organs . A single RNA panel was screened first for mRNA encoding L - plastin ( Fig . 7 , panel A ) ; the hybrid panel was then stripped and screened for T - plastin mRNA in a second round of hybridization ( Fig . 7 , panel B ) ; and then it was stripped again Human Plastin Genes 2791 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A , ; c1 B C FIG . 7 . Northern blots of total RNAs isolated from nine rat tissues .

Tissue RNAs in Northern blots : lune 1 , lung ; lune 2 , heart ; lane 3 , skeletal muscle ; lune 4 , spleen ; lune 5 , kidney ; lune 6 , jejunum ; lune 7 , ileum ; lune 8 , adrenal gland ; and lune 9 , liver . The L - plastin , T - plastin , and fimbrin mRNAs migrated electrophoretically as 3 . 7 - , 3 . 4 - , and 3 . 8 - kb transcripts . and screened for fimbrin mRNA in a third round of hybridi - zation ( Fig . 7 , panel C ) using the chick fimbrin cDNA as a probe ( 23 ) . L - plastin mRNA ( 3 . 7 kb ) was detected in all tissues but was present in greatly varying amounts among these tissues with spleen and lung which harbor the highest concentrations of hemopoietic cells , exhibiting significantly higher mRNA levels than the other six tissues ( Fig . 7 , panel A ) . Since all tissues contain an imbedded hemopoietic com - ponent , we suspect that the L - plastin mRNA in these solid tissues reflects the size of the hemopoietic subpopulation of these tissues . T - plastin mRNA ( 3 . 4 kb ) was detected in vary - ing amounts in all tissues except jejunum and ileum of the small intestine ( Fig . 7 , panel B ) , which are known to differ - entiate the brush border epithelium . In sharp contrast to the two plastin isoforms , fimbrin mRNA ( 3 . 8 kb ) , which migrated electrophoretically as a slightly larger mRNA than L - plastin mRNA , was detected in abundant amounts in the jejunum ( Fig . 7 , panel C , lane 6 ) and ileum ( Fig . 7 , panel C , lane 7 ) of the small intestine , and also in trace levels in the kidney ( Fig . 7 , panel C , lane 5 ) ; however , it was not detectable in the other five tissues examined . This striking contrast in relative tissue distribution of mRNAs encoding the three isoforms is con - sistent with the identity of fimbrin as a third tissue - specific isoform of the plastin family . DISCUSSION Plastin genes are a conserved family of genes that encode isoforms of actin - binding proteins which are differentially expressed among tissues . Two genes of this family encoding the L - and T - plastin isoforms were characterized in this study with regard to their genetic structure , chromosome location , and expression in normal and neoplastic cells . These two genes contained no homologous sequences in their noncoding exons , introns , and 5”flanking sequences , but they exhibited conserved exon - intron junctions and high conservation in their exon sequences ( 21 , 22 ) indicating that expression of each of these genes is governed by separate regulatory mech - anisms . These findings also indicate that these two genes have diverged from a common ancestral gene leading to the dispersion of the L - plastin gene to chromosome 13 and the T - plastin gene to the X chromosome . To the best of our knowledge the T - plastin gene is the first gene with an archi - tectural role to be found on the X chromosome . A previous study examining familial co - segregation of allelic variant poly - peptides encoded by the L - plastin gene and esterase D gene has provided additional evidence that the L - plastin gene is located on chromosome 13 near the esterase D and retino - blastoma loci ( 34 ) . A third plastin gene encoding fimbrin , which is specifically expressed in the brush border epithelium of the small intes - tine , exhibits amino acid sequence conservation ( 23 ) and therefore also appears to have evolved from the same ancestor gene . The striking contrast in relative tissue distribution of mRNAs encoding each of the three isoforms is consistent with the identity of fimbrin as a third tissue - specific isoform of the plastin family . Furthermore , the random distribution of amino acid sequence differences between fimbrin and L - and T - plastin ( 23 ) argues strongly that fimbrin does not arise from an exon editing process involving one of the two plastin genes , instead , fimbrin must be encoded by a third single - copy gene in mammals . In further support of this conclusion , partial sequencing of a human cDNA clone isolated using the chick fimbrin cDNA probe ( 23 ) confirmed that fimbrin is a third isoform encoded by a unique gene of its own since its nucleotide sequence predicted differences between the human fimbrin amino acid sequence and the amino acid sequences of L - and T - pla ~ tin . ~ We speculate that the duplication and chromosomal segregation of these three genes was necessary during mammalian evolution because three functionally dif - ferent plastins were required for distinctly different functional cell types . Those cell types that are migratory such as lym - phocytes acquired the ability to express L - plastin , those that are relatively immobile such as fibroblasts and epithelial cells acquired the ability to express T - plastin , and those that possessed abundant brush border microvilli ( supported by actin bundles ) acquired the ability to express actin - bundling fimbrin . Given the fundamental actin binding role of plastins ( 23 , 26 ) and the differing tissue distribution for each isoform , we expect to find differing functions for the three plastin isoforms that are compatible with the differing migratory properties and cell architectures of hemopoietic , non - hemo - poietic , and tumor - forming cells . In the accompanying paper ( 27 ) , we discuss potential mechanisms that control the differ - ential expression of the L - and T - plastin genes in these differing cell types . In all , 31 out of 49 ( 63 % ) of the human cell strains derived from unrelated solid tumors of non - hemopoietic origin exhib - ited L - plastin expression . The correlation of L - plastin with female reproductive tract tumors was most striking since cyclic steroid exposure is believed to play a role in the devel - opment of breast tumors ( 40 ) . Ovarian cancers , breast cancers , and a leiomyosarcoma exhibited high levels of expression of L - plastin in 13 of 14 cell lines examined while normal mam - mary epithelial cells expressed only T - plastin . The discovery of both estrogen and progesterone receptor - response elements flanking the L - plastin promoter and hormonal regulation of expression of L - plastin in some reproductive tissues ( 27 ) hints at a link between hormonal regulation of the development of these tumors and subsequent constitutive expression of L - plastin in cell lines produced by these tumors . Neither of the three retinoblastoma cell lines expressed L - plastin . The Y79 and Gordon I1 retinoblastoma cell lines were the only human cell lines examined thus far that failed to express either L - or T - plastin at detectable levels . The other retinoblastoma cell line , WERI - RB - 1 , expressed unusually low levels of T - plastin mRNA and no L - plastin . Since one retinoblastoma expressed T - plastin , albeit at low levels , we suspect that reduction of T - plastin expression may have ac - ‘ C . - S . Lin and P . Matsudaira , unpublished results . 2792 Human Plastin Genes companied the formation of these three tumors . The pan - creatic carcinoma ( Capan - 1 ) and liposarcoma ( SW872 ) cell lines expressed low , but detectable levels of L - plastin mRNA . The melanoma and HOS osteosarcoma cell line also expressed relatively low levels L - plastin mRNA , but expression of L - plastin polypeptide in these latter two cell lines was high enough to be detected in 2 - D gels ( 17 ) and confirmed by Western blotting . Otherwise , L - plastin was one of the most abundant polypeptides in the majority of tumor cell lines in which it was detected ( for microdensitometry measurements , see Refs . 14 , 24 , and 25 ) . The one in uitro transformed fibroblast cell line ( MRC5 - SV2 ) which expressed L - plastin protein and mRNA abun - dantly , was recently characterized by Celis et al . ( 35 ) for the diversity of total polypeptide expression and transformation - induced changes . Celis et al . ( 35 ) indicated that L - plastin was the most abundant induced polypeptide of the group of six polypeptide species out of a total of 1895 polypeptides that were otherwise common between this SV40 - transformed cell line and the parent diploid fibroblast strain MRC5 embryonic lung fibroblasts . Our confirmation of L - plastin expression in this SV40 - transformed cell line provides direct evidence that L - plastin synthesis is induced accompanying some neoplastic transformation events . Is there a role for L - plastin in human tumorigenesis ? It is well established that tumor forming cells undergo morpholog - ical transformation which includes significant changes in the cytoplasmic organization of the microfilament system ( 3 , 4 ) . This phenotypic change is accompanied by significant mod - ulations in actin and tropomyosin expression ( 5 - 16 ) and even actin mutations ( 5 , 6 , 13 ) . In addition , oncogenes have been identified that encode both actin and tropomyosin domains ( 17 - 19 ) . Therefore , it is not surprising to find other actin - binding proteins such as plastins that are modulated accom - panying neoplastic transformation . Indeed , 65 % of all solid tumors examined have exhibited induction of L - plastin expression ; an additional 6 % of the tumors that did not exhibit L - plastin induction exhibited evidence of reduced T - plastin expression ; constitutive phosphorylation of L - plastin was also found to be associated with lymphocyte immortali - zation ( 37 ) ; and in at least one SV40 - transformed human fibroblast line , L - plastin was one of only six induced cellular proteins out of 1895 polypeptides surveyed ( 35 ) . The fre - quency with which these changes in plastin expression are associated with neoplasia argue strongly in favor of a func - tional role for plastin in the human cell transformation proc - ess .
