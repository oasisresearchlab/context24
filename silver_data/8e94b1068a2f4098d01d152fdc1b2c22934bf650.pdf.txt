The study of epithe - lial morphogenesis is instrumental to the understanding of disease processes where epithelial polarity is disrupted . Recently , we demonstrated that matrix - induced cell confinement controls the acquisition of three - dimensional epithelial polarity , by modulating the initiation of the apical membrane to form a central lumen ( J Cell Biol 2012 ; 198 : 1011 - 1026 ) . Cell confine - ment can be achieved by use of micropa - tterned culture chips that allow precise micrometric - scale control of the cell adhe - sion surface and its composition . Using micropattern chips , we demonstrated that polarizing epithelial cells require high confinement conditions to properly posi - tion the centrosome and the trafficking machinery toward the cell - cell contacts and to initiate lumen morphogenesis . Low confinement induces LKB1 and RhoA - mediated cell contractility , which inhib - its this mechanism for lumen formation . Deactivation of Myosin - II - mediated con - tractility rescued normal lumen initia - tion in low confinement conditions . Our results indicate that a mechanotransduc - tion pathway coordinates nuclear and centrosome positioning to initiate epithe - lial morphogenesis . Here we discuss the potential candidates that control this pro - cess , specifically the polarized activation of Rho and Rab - family GTPases , and also a group of recently characterized nuclear transcription factors . Introduction Epithelial organs are involved in the majority of the vital functions of higher Mechanical control of epithelial lumen formation Alejo E . Rodríguez - Fraticelli and Fernando Martín - Belmonte * Centro de Biología Molecular “Severo Ochoa” ; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas ( CSIC ) ; Universidad Autónoma de Madrid ( UAM ) ; Madrid , Spain animals . The epithelial tissue constitutes the outermost layer of an epithelial organ and acts as a functional barrier that sur - rounds a central lumen , an extracellular fluid - filled space connected to the out - side world . The single functional unit of an epithelial organ is the polarized epithelial cell , which requires the estab - lishment and maintenance of distinct apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains , separated by the apical junc - tion complexes that connect each cell to its neighbors . 1 Pioneering studies in the field of cell - to - cell interactions demon - strated that the establishment of cell - cell contacts constitutes the spatial cue that initiates the process of cell polarization in epithelial differentiation . 2 , 3 However , an in - depth understanding of the involve - ment of cell - to - matrix contacts in epithe - lial morphogenesis had remained elusive until the introduction of three - dimen - sional ( 3D ) matrix cell cultures . 4 These 3D - culture methods , which use extracts of collagen - I , laminin and other extra - cellular matrix ( ECM ) gels , constitute a more physiological approach to mimic the internal organ conditions of epithelial cells and allow the unraveling of multi - ple molecular pathways involved in epi - thelial cell polarity and morphogenesis . However , only a few studies to date have performed a separate analysis of the indi - vidual properties of the ECM and their contribution to epithelial cell polariza - tion . 5 Recent work using micropatterned devices , from our laboratory and others , has begun to shed light on the function of cell - to - matrix interactions . Our results suggest that cells translate not only bio - chemical signals , but also biophysical extracellular conditions , into signaling © 2013 Lande s B i o sc i en c e .

Taken together , these results indicate that both ciliogenesis and lumen initiation occur in conditions of low contractility and also that stress fiber formation inhib - its some important molecular mechanisms required for proper epithelial morphogen - esis . This data also suggested that not only the presence of laminin ( and thus activa - tion of Rac1 ) but also high confinement ( and thus inactivation of RhoA ) is required for proper initial epithelial polarization . Interestingly , we found that laminin pre - vents proper spreading and contractility of MDCK cells , suggesting that laminin could be sufficient for both activation of Rac1 and inactivation of RhoA . MDCK cells express laminin - binding receptors , such as α 6 - β 1 integrin , which might be responsible for this observed effect . Indeed , β 1 blocking antibodies prevent proper laminin organization and result in loss of polarity . 12 Recent progress has shown that laminin is organized in epi - thelial organoids through collective rota - tion of cells , and triggering this movement is essential for epithelial morphogenesis . 15 Furthermore , laminin - mediated integrin activation controls microtubule orienta - tion through integrin - linked kinase ( ILK ) , which might be responsible for preventing or controlling basal actin contractility and 3D cell spreading . 16 After polarity is orientated , lumen for - mation requires vesicular trafficking and de novo assembly of tight junctions at the site where the new apical membrane is going to be formed . 17 We believe that centrosome positioning and microtubule organization play a decisive role in this process ( Fig . 1C ) . Indeed , the vesicular trafficking required for lumen forma - tion occurs through a complex molecu - lar mechanism orchestrated by the small Rho GTPase Cdc42 and the Rab - family GTPases , Rab11 , Rab8 and Rab27 . 18 - 20 The specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) for Rab8 and Cdc42 , Rabin8 and Intersectin - 2 , respectively , bind to the centrosome , suggesting that centrosome orientation might position the site of de novo apical plasma mem - brane formation . Interestingly , primary epithelial morphogenesis could be modu - lated by contractility and thus , more easily studied using micropatterns . As some of the pathways involved in ciliogenesis and lumen formation appear to be common , we decided to analyze whether contractility could affect lumen initiation in the model of MDCK cyst formation . 11 For this purpose we took advantage of a specific feature of this model , which is the clearly visible for - mation of the initial lumen at the two cell stage , after the first cell division , by staining the apical marker podocalyxin / gp135 . Previous work on lumen formation provided evidence that initial polarity orientation requires laminin and Rac1 - GTPase signaling , and that Rac1 defects can be rescued by inhibiting Rho kinase ( ROCK ) , thus suggesting that contractil - ity might play a role in this process . 12 , 13 We followed the same premise as Pitaval and colleagues and seeded MDCK cells on a substrate where they could adhere and stretch ( collagen - I ) and then modified the adhesive surface by using micropatterns of different sizes ( Fig . 1B ) . On low confine - ment , MDCK cells produced numerous stress fibers and mature focal adhesions , and cells did not form an initial lumen after the first cell division . In contrast , high confinement was sufficient to induce correct lumen initiation . Similarly to the effects previously observed in cilio - genesis , lumen initiation was rescued on low confinement by myosin - II inhibi - tion . Furthermore , forcing contractility , by overexpression of constitutively active myosin - II regulatory chain , showed that stress fiber formation was sufficient to prevent correct centrosomal position - ing and lumen formation in high con - finement . Thus , cell - cell junctions and increased confinement produced by cell - confluency were not sufficient to form the initial lumen in conditions that pro - mote high cellular contractility . Also , we observed that RhoA and ROCK activity regulate contractility in the 3D - MDCK model , and an inhibition of Rho activ - ity consistently rescued lumen formation , thus resembling other mechanosensing pathways described during embryonic endothelial tubulogenesis . 14 Moreover , we found that liver kinase B1 ( LKB1 ) activ - ity was required for maintaining RhoA pathways which are required for epithe - lial morphogenesis . 6 Cell confinement control of epithelial lumen formation . The effect of mechani - cal stress on morphogenesis has been extensively analyzed in developmental biology . 7 Early works using in vitro mod - els established that different types of cells , including epithelial tissues , could modify their behavior depending on the mechani - cal properties of the underlying matrix via a complex mechanism requiring the cyto - skeletal contractility machinery . More recent in vivo data from C . elegans embryos has also shown that forces generated by contraction of the whole animal can also be translated to the epidermis through hemidesmosome - like structures and con - served Rac1 signaling , and these forces are required for normal epithelial morphogen - esis . 8 To underpin the mechanical basis of morphogenesis , numerous tools have been developed , including the use of cell chips and micropatterns to control the adhesive properties of the cell environment . 9 Using these tools a recent study has revealed that ciliogenesis , a hallmark of differentiated epithelia , is controlled by the ability of the cell to sense spatial confinement through changes in actin - mediated contractility . 10 In this work , Pitaval et al . analyzed cilio - genesis using a variety of micropatterned adhesive surfaces to modify cell confine - ment ( Fig . 1A ) . Their results showed that cells on low confinement did not polar - ize or initiate ciliogenesis correctly and also formed fewer shorter ventral cilia . In contrast , cells on high confinement ( using a smaller micropattern size per cell ) formed typical longer apical primary cilia . Furthermore , cells on low confinement presented a very pronounced contractile phenotype , with mature focal adhesions and abundant stress fiber formation . Consistently , inhibition of myosin - II - mediated contractility with blebbistatin , or depolymerization of actin with cyto - chalasin D , was sufficient to prevent stress fiber formation under low confine - ment , and restored primary cilia forma - tion in the apical part of the cell . These results indicate that cell contractility and primary cilia formation are mutually exclusive processes in cellular physiology . Furthermore , they introduce the pos - sibility that other processes required for © 2013 Lande s B i o sc i en c e . D o no t d i s t r i bu t e . 138 Small GTPases Volume 4 Issue 2 Data gathered in the last decade have provided important evidence regarding the molecular mechanisms associated with lumen formation . Additionally , modifica - tions in gene expression are also known to occur and to be required during epithelial in a polarized activation of Cdc42 and specific RabGTPases . These RabGTPases and Cdc42 , in turn , recruit the necessary effectors involved in the generation of polarized membrane trafficking to form the lumen and the primary cilium . ciliogenesis shares , with lumen formation , a common polarized trafficking machin - ery . 21 - 23 In summary , we propose that laminin signaling and cell confinement mediate the orientation of the nucleo - centrosomal polarity axis , which results Figure 1 . Models for matrix - mediated control of cell polarity and epithelial morphogenesis . ( A ) Cell confinement modulates cell spreading , focal adhesion formation and F - actin stress fiber polymerization and contraction . Cells in high confinement or low stiffness spread poorly and do not form contractile fibers . In low confinement ( or stiff matrices ) cells extend their surface and form large actin stress fibers and focal adhesions . The orientation of the centrosome changes from the apical ( dorsal ) region of the cell in high confinement to the basal ( ventral ) region in low confinement and controls ciliogenesis . ( B ) Cell confinement induces formation of lumens between adjacent cells . In low confinement , cell contractility prevents centrosome orientation toward the junctions and lumen initiation . ( C ) The mechanism of lumen initiation activates Cdc42 and Rab8 through GEFs localized to the Golgi and the centrosome that are polarized toward the junctions in high confinement . ( D ) Transcription factors such as YAP / TAZ , SRF - coactivator MAL and β - catenin present changes in their nuclear localization regulated by F - actin fiber polymerization and contractility . In high confinement , G - actin levels are high and induce MAL transport to the nucleus where it induces SRF - mediated transcription of MAL target genes . High confinement also induces YAP / TAZ phosphorylation and prevents its nuclear localization . In contrast , high contractility induces actin polymerization and stress fiber formation , and prevents MAL nuclear shuttling , while it induces YAP / TAZ transport to the nucleus . © 2013 Lande s B i o sc i en c e . D o no t d i s t r i bu t e . www . landesbioscience . com Small GTPases 139 expect that new and exciting findings will continue to fill the gaps in our present knowledge . First , additional efforts should be directed toward uncovering novel tran - scription factors and mechanisms involved in the nuclear translation of external mechanical cues . Second , it will be indis - pensable to understand better how subtle changes in contractility activate these transcription factors , to relay the signal to the nucleus . Additionally , increasing evidence suggests that β - catenin , YAP / TAZ and many other transcription fac - tors can also be regulated by recruitment to mature cell - cell junctions , which also sense mechanotransduction by different means . 35 Thus , the equilibrium between cell confinement and cell junction matu - ration will most likely modulate a variety of transcription factors to shift the bal - ance of differentiation and proliferation in polarizing epithelial cells . These efforts will be crucial for the design of next - gener - ation pharmacological approaches which attempt to reestablish cell differentiation in the treatment of epithelial diseases such as cancer , as well as in the development of more robust strategies for stem cell culture and targeted differentiation .

Cell spreading and contractility also regulate the SRF cofactor MAL through binding and detection of globular actin ( G - actin ) . 29 , 30 In high confinement con - ditions , SRF activates specific targets in the nucleus and induces epidermal stem cell differentiation . In low confinement ( high - stress ) conditions , filamentous actin ( F - actin ) is polymerized actively in the cytoplasm to maintain cell shape and movement , and this prevents epider - mal stem cell differentiation . Thus , the G - actin / F - actin ratio controls SRF bind - ing to MAL and promotes the activation of different MAL - dependent and inde - pendent SRF - target genes . Even though progress has been made , so far it remains unclear exactly how these and other tran - scription factors modulate epithelial cell morphogenesis . Recent data have shown that SRF is required for polarized ori - ented cell division and morphogenesis in the epidermis . 31 In addition , a subset of genes that are induced and required during lumen morphogenesis and cilio - genesis ( such as ITSN2 , Slp2 - a , Ninein or Cep164 ) contain consensus promoter sequences for SRF binding . In this regard , it will be of crucial importance to under - stand the processes by which mechano - sensory - mediated gene expression controls known molecular pathways of epithelial morphogenesis . It will also be necessary to understand the role of these mechanisms in a broader array of epithelial cell types and animal models . Conclusions : Mechanotransduction as a main driver of cell differentiation and polarity . Mechanotransduction path - ways are beginning to be understood , both at the initial molecular events con - trolling cell stretching , nuclear movement and centrosome positioning , and also later nuclear signaling cascades directing gene expression and cell differentiation . Mechanotransduction pathway analysis is progressively stepping into the limelight of important human disease conditions , such as cancer and polycystic kidney dis - ease , where epithelial cell division and polarity are affected . 32 - 34 In this sense we morphogenesis . As an example , we have described recently a set of 16 regulators of lumen formation , including two synapto - tagmin - like proteins that belong to a fam - ily of Rab - effectors , which are induced very early ( a few hours ) after seeding cells on laminin - rich ECMs , and are required for lumen formation . 18 Despite this recent progress , it is still currently unknown which signaling pathways and nuclear transcription factors are involved in trans - lating ECM signaling to gene expression and how they function to induce lumen formation . In this final part of the review we will suggest some possible mechano - transduction pathways that have been studied in other models of epithelial dif - ferentiation , which might shed some light in this direction . Mechanosensory control of cell differ - entiation . During the last decade several studies have shown that cells can sense ECM mechanical properties through the activation of specific cytoskeletal machin - ery . Activation of cytoskeletal signaling , in turn , modulates nuclear transcriptional programs leading to differentiation to a variety of cell types . 24 These mechano - transduction pathways are constituted by matrix - binding molecules , such as integrins , focal adhesion forming com - plexes and actin fibers and bundles , as well as a series of nuclear membrane pro - tein complexes , such as the LINC com - plexes , which are capable of translating the cytoskeletal signal into the nucleus . 25 Additionally , several studies have char - acterized a series of transcription factors , including β - catenin , serum response fac - tor ( SRF ) , Yes - activated protein ( YAP ) , NF - κ B , etc . , which are transported into or out of the nucleus depending on the levels of mechanical cell stress ( Fig . 1D ) . 26 The role of YAP in cellular mechano - transduction was uncovered through anal - ysis of differential gene expression in cells cultured on stiff vs . soft matrices . 27 , 28 YAP behavior was also analyzed in cells using micropatterns of different size , resulting in the observation that dephosphorylated YAP accumulates in the nucleus in low confinement conditions where it activates genes required for cell proliferation . 28 On soft substrates , or low confinement , YAP is phosphorylated and excluded from the nucleus .
