Our previous work has shown Drosophila cofilin ( DmCFL ) knockdown causes 36 progressive deterioration of muscle structure and function and produces features seen in nemaline 37 myopathy ( NM ) caused by cofilin mutations . We hypothesized that disruption of actin 38 cytoskeleton dynamics by DmCFL knockdown would impact other aspects of muscle 39 development , and , thus , conducted an RNA sequencing analysis which unexpectedly revealed 40 upregulated expression of numerous neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) genes . We found that DmCFL 41 is enriched in the muscle postsynaptic compartment and that DmCFL deficiency causes F - actin 42 disorganization in this subcellular domain prior to the sarcomere defects observed later in 43 development . Despite NMJ gene expression changes , we found no significant changes in gross 44 presynaptic Bruchpilot active zones or total postsynaptic glutamate receptor levels . However , 45 DmCFL knockdown results in mislocalization of glutamate receptors containing the GluRIIA 46 subunit in more deteriorated muscles and neurotransmission strength is strongly impaired . These 47 findings expand our understanding of cofilin’s roles in muscle to include NMJ structural 48 development and suggest that NMJ defects may contribute to NM pathophysiology . 49 3 Introduction 50 51 Skeletal muscle is critical for daily functions , including respiration , posture control , and 52 coordinated movement . Muscle contraction and relaxation require many levels of organization : 53 each cell is made up of myofibrils , which are concatenations of the contractile sarcomeres . The 54 sarcomere is composed of thin filaments anchored at Z - discs and thick filaments containing 55 myosin motors that enable filament sliding . Thin filaments comprise filamentous actin ( F - actin ) 56 and actin - binding proteins that anchor , maintain length , and regulate myosin binding . 57 58 The actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin family maintains filament length by inducing a 59 unique conformational change at ADP - actin filaments to promote actin severing and prevent G - 60 actin nucleotide exchange ( Galkin et al . , 2011 ; Hayden et al . , 1993 ) . The vertebrate family 61 includes ADF / destrin , cofilin - 1 , and cofilin - 2 , with cofilin - 2 predominant in postnatal and mature 62 skeletal muscle ( Mohri et al . , 2000 ; Ono et al . , 1994 ; Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ) . Cofilin - 2 is 63 important for skeletal muscle development , maintenance , regeneration , and for determining thin 64 filament length ( Agrawal et al . , 2012 ; Gurniak et al . , 2014 ; Kremneva et al . , 2014 ; Ono et al . , 65 1994 ; Thirion et al . , 2001 ) . Mutations in twelve actin and sarcomere - related genes , including 66 CFL2 , have been implicated in nemaline myopathy ( NM ) , a skeletal muscle disease that presents 67 with progressive weakness , particularly during the perinatal period in its most severe forms 68 ( Christophers et al . , 2022 ; Sewry et al . , 2019 ) . NM diagnosis is based on myopathic clinical 69 disease hallmarks , including hypotonia and proximal muscle weakness , as well as the presence of 70 actin - rich accumulations ( known as nemaline rods or bodies ) and myofibrillar disruption on 71 pathology . CFL2 NM patients have generalized muscle weakness ; delayed motor skills ; stiff spine ; 72 kyphoscoliosis ; and joint contractures ( Agrawal et al . , 2007 ; Fattori et al . , 2018 ; Ockeloen et al . , 73 2012 ; Ong et al . , 2014 ) . Mutations in CFL2 have been described as recessive and hypomorphs and 74 lead to reduced levels of cofilin activity in muscle . 75 76 Cofilin is conserved across species , and cofilin - deficient disease models have been developed in 77 mice , C . elegans , and Drosophila melanogaster . Several strategies have been used to study cofilin - 78 2 in mouse models , including constitutive knockout , muscle - specific excision , chimeras that have 79 a combination of knockout and wildtype cells , and knock - in of an NM mutation ( Agrawal et al . , 80 4 2012 ; Gurniak et al . , 2014 ; Mohri et al . , 2019 ; Morton et al . , 2015 ; Rosen et al . , 2020 ) . Mice 81 from all these models are small and have myofibrillar organization defects . Most die in the early 82 postnatal period , which indicates that cofilin - 2 is not essential for initial myofibrillogenesis but is 83 important for postnatal muscle maintenance . In C . elegans , the cofilin isoform UNC - 60B is 84 required for incorporating actin into developing myofibrils , and mutants develop actin aggregates 85 in body wall muscle ( Ono et al . , 1999 ; Ono et al . , 2003 ) . In Drosophila , we previously 86 characterized the effect of muscle - specific knockdown ( KD ) of the cofilin homolog twinstar , the 87 only cofilin homolog in Drosophila ( Balakrishnan et al . , 2020 ) . Drosophila cofilin ( DmCFL ) KD 88 leads to progressive muscle deterioration over the larval developmental stages . Actin accumulation 89 occurs as a result of improper sarcomere addition at the growing muscle ends , and , eventually , 90 they form throughout the cell , reminiscent of those seen in NM patients . Introducing wild type 91 human CFL1 or CFL2 rescued this deterioration phenotype in DmCFL KD , while that of a human 92 CFL2 NM mutation did not , supporting the use of this system to understand human NM disease . 93 94 To further investigate the DmCFL KD model , we conducted RNA sequencing which identified 95 changes in genes related to the neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) , the specialized synapse where the 96 presynaptic motor neuron and postsynaptic muscle communicate . Early case reports examining 97 NM muscle biopsies provide evidence of NMJ disruption , describing abnormal motor end plates 98 and synaptic clefts ( Fukuhara et al . , 1978 ; Heffernan et al . , 1968 ) . Moreover , electromyography 99 shows a myopathic pattern in NM patients , although it is unclear if there is additional superimposed 100 NMJ transmission defect . Cytoplasmic actin and other actin - binding proteins are present at the 101 vertebrate NMJ ( Berthier and Blaineau , 1997 ; Bloch and Hall , 1983 ; Hall et al . , 1981 ) . 102 Additionally , in vertebrates , actin podosomes are critical for shaping the complex organization of 103 postsynaptic proteins ( reviewed in Bernadzki et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , it is possible that disruption of 104 actin and actin - binding proteins would affect the NMJ in NM patients . Recently , a case report of 105 two NM patients with a mutation in alpha - actin describes abnormal postsynaptic muscle 106 membrane at the NMJ , but it is unknown whether this finding is generalizable all NM patients 107 ( Labasse et al . , 2022 ) . At the widely - used Drosophila larval NMJ , proper actin organization at the 108 muscle postsynapse is important for synaptic development , neurotransmitter receptor localization , 109 and neurotransmission ( Chen et al . , 2005 ; Pielage et al . , 2006 ; Wang et al . , 2010 ) . Based on the 110 5 results of our RNA sequencing experiment and these previous Drosophila studies , we sought to 111 better understand the NMJ in the DmCFL KD model and its contribution to disease development . 112 113 Here , we report that DmCFL is present near the muscle postsynaptic membrane , where it is 114 important for proper actin organization in this region . We found that , in DmCFL KD , while the 115 motor neuron properly innervates the muscle , postsynaptic structural organization is disrupted 116 prior to and in parallel with muscle structure deterioration . Although transcriptomic analysis 117 suggested changes in many synaptic components , we did not see defects in the presence of active 118 zones or total glutamate receptors . However , DmCFL is important for the localization of glutamate 119 receptor subunit A ( GluRIIA ) at the postsynapse , and DmCFL KD results in decreased NMJ 120 neurotransmission . Together , these findings show that cofilin is important for NMJ postsynaptic 121 structure , actin organization , GluRIIA localization , and synaptic signaling . 122 123 Results 124 125 Muscle - specific DmCFL knockdown alters neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) gene expression 126 127 We have previously developed a Drosophila cofilin ( DmCFL ) knockdown ( KD ) model that has 128 disrupted sarcomere structure , protein aggregates , and reduced muscle function , which are features 129 of nemaline myopathy ( NM ) pathology ( Balakrishnan et al . , 2020 ) . We used the GAL4 / UAS 130 system with a muscle - specific Myosin heavy chain promoter ( Mhc - Gal4 ) driving an RNA 131 interference ( RNAi ) construct targeting mCherry ( control , UAS - mCherry RNAi ) or twinstar 132 ( UAS - tsr RNAi ) , the only DmCFL gene . MhcGal4 > UAS - tsr RNAi ( DmCFL KD ) larvae have 133 decreased DmCFL RNA ( 27 . 9 % of control level ) and DmCFL protein ( 38 . 2 % of control level ) in 134 larval body wall muscles ( Fig . S1A - C ) . Levels of inactive phosphorylated DmCFL ( p - DmCFL ) 135 were similarly reduced ( 32 . 1 % of control level ) . 136 137 The DmCFL KD model showed a progressive muscle deterioration phenotype that we separate 138 into three classes . Class 1 muscles retained sarcomeric actin organization in the muscle cell , class 139 2 muscles developed accumulation of actin at the cell poles with retained sarcomeric organization , 140 and class 3 muscles lost overall muscle and sarcomeric integrity , in addition to having actin 141 6 accumulations throughout the cell ( Balakrishnan et al . , 2020 ) . Our data show a deterioration 142 progression from class 1 into class 2 muscles , which , ultimately , give rise to class 3 muscles . At 143 the final wandering third instar , all three muscle classes were present in an individual larva , with 144 classes 2 and 3 predominating . In the present study , we analyzed ventral longitudinal muscles VL3 145 and VL4 ( also known as muscles 6 and 7 , respectively ) . These paired muscles are well - 146 characterized , easily accessible , and share the same motor neuron innervation . We first performed 147 a series of imaging and transcriptomic experiments to gain better understanding of the DmCFL 148 KD phenotype . 149 150 First , to characterize the frequencies of the different muscle class combinations , we analyzed the 151 F - actin sarcomeric structure at the wandering third instar stage based on phalloidin labeling . 152 Despite sharing the same orientation , body position , and motor neuron , we found that these two 153 muscles can be different classes , and thus , are not dependent on each other for their structural 154 integrity ( Fig . 1A ) . We considered the combination of VL3 / 4 classes as groups . Group 1 pairs had 155 only class 1 muscles , while group 2 pairs had at least one class 2 muscle and group 3 pairs had at 156 least one class 3 muscle . Most muscle pairs in wandering third instar larvae consist of two class 3 157 muscles ( 62 % ) , yet even at this late stage some muscle pairs consist of two class 1 muscles ( 16 % , 158 Fig . 1B ) . We used confocal microscopy to image live larvae expressing a DmCFL : : GFP protein , 159 which showed that DmCFL localized to both the muscle sarcomere and myonuclei ( Fig . 1C - E ) . 160 Using immunofluorescence and structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) , we confirmed that 161 DmCFL is present at the sarcomere Z - line and H - zone ( Fig . 1F ) . Importantly , DmCFL is reduced 162 at the sarcomere in DmCFL KD ( Fig . 1F ; Balakrishnan et al . , 2020 ) . 163 164 To quantifiably test the transcriptomic profile of DmCFL KD muscles , we dissected third instar 165 larvae to produce muscle - enriched preparations for bulk RNA sequencing ( Fig . 2 ; Fig . S2 ) . 166 Differential expression analysis using the DESeq2 package revealed a total of 1417 differentially - 167 expressed genes with at least a two - fold change in DmCFL KD compared to control : 558 genes 168 with decreased and 850 genes with increased expression ( Fig . 2A ; Fig . S2C - D ) . Reduced DmCFL 169 expression was further confirmed in DmCFL KD muscle ( Fig . S2B ) . RNA sequencing identified 170 changes in genes related to actin binding or regulation . Overrepresentation analysis using the Gene 171 Ontology ( GO ) biological processes gene sets showed that protein degradation processes were 172 7 significantly reduced ( Fig . 2B , Table S1 ; Ashburner et al . , 2000 ; Gene Ontology Consortium et 173 al . , 2023 ) . This finding was consistent with our previous work where increasing proteasomal 174 activity in DmCFL KD larvae improved the muscle deterioration phenotype ( Balakrishnan et al . , 175 2020 ) . Prominently , upregulated pathways were related to synaptic signaling ( Fig . 2C , Table S1 ) , 176 due to increased expression of several genes acting at the neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ; Fig . 2D ) . 177 These gene products have been previously reported to be functional on the presynaptic ( i . e . motor 178 neuron ) and the postsynaptic ( i . e . muscle ) sides of the NMJ . 179 180 Given these identified transcriptomic changes related to motor neuron - muscle communication at 181 the NMJ , we next examined DmCFL and actin cytoskeleton in the postsynaptic domain . 182 183 DmCFL protein is enriched at the muscle postsynapse and is reduced in DmCFL KD 184 185 The specialized postsynaptic muscle membrane , known as the subsynaptic reticulum ( SSR ) , can 186 be visualized using an antibody against the Discs - large ( Dlg ) scaffold protein ( Lahey et al . , 1994 ) . 187 The motor neuron presynaptic membrane can be visualized using anti - horseradish peroxidase 188 ( HRP ; Jan and Jan , 1982 ) . The SSR apposes the motor axonal endings ( boutons ) , with distinctive 189 Dlg rings around HRP signal ( Fig . 3A ) . To test the presence of DmCFL at the postsynapse , both 190 live and fixed imaging were used . For the following experiments , we focused our analyses on 191 muscle pairs that had at least one class 1 or 2 muscle , since the postsynapse could not be reliably 192 quantified in muscle pairs with both class 3 muscles due to their severe muscle deterioration . 193 194 Live imaging in DmCFL : : GFP larvae showed the protein is enriched at the muscle SSR in a pattern 195 consistent with the ring patterns of the postsynaptic density ( Fig . 3B ) . In fixed samples , 196 immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy showed that both total and inactive p - DmCFL are 197 found at the postsynapse ( Fig . 3C , D ) . However , we found that both DmCFL and p - DmCFL are 198 reduced overall within DmCFL KD muscles . SIM imaging confirmed that DmCFL is found at the 199 postsynapse in opposition to the boutons and that this local postsynaptic DmCFL is reduced in 200 DmCFL KD muscles ( Fig . 3E ) . 201 202 8 Given that the antibody against DmCFL also recognized DmCFL in the motor neuron , we sought 203 to restrict our analysis to the postsynaptic domain while also minimizing signal from the 204 underlying sarcomeres ( approach described in detail in Fig . S3 ) . We found that postsynaptic total 205 DmCFL and p - DmCFL were both reduced in KD muscles : 69 . 2 % and 48 . 4 % of control levels , 206 respectively ( Fig . 3F , G ) . 207 208 Together , these data suggest that DmCFL and inactive p - DmCFL are enriched at the postsynaptic 209 domain , and both are reduced in this region in in the DmCFL KD model . 210 211 Postsynaptic actin organization is disrupted in DmCFL KD muscles 212 213 Regulation of F - actin by actin - binding proteins is important at the SSR membrane for proper 214 cytoskeletal organization ( Blunk et al . , 2014 ; Pielage et al . , 2006 ; Ramachandran et al . , 2009 ; 215 Wang et al . , 2010 ) . In the DmCFL KD model , we previously described aberrant F - actin 216 accumulation at the fiber poles in class 2 and actin aggregates in class 3 muscles ( Balakrishnan et 217 al . , 2020 ) . Similarly , we now show that F - actin accumulates in the postsynaptic region in class 2 218 and 3 DmCFL KD muscles ( Fig . 4A - B ) . In three - dimensions , the actin cytoskeleton formed a halo 219 that enveloped the HRP - positive synaptic bouton , even if there were intact sarcomeres present 220 deeper in a class 2 muscle ( Movie 1 ) . These data indicate that the F - actin network at the 221 postsynaptic domain was affected prior to the complete muscle sarcomere deterioration seen in 222 class 3 muscles . Postsynaptic F - actin accumulation occurred in both class 2 and 3 muscles 223 independent of the class of its adjacent muscle in the VL3 / 4 muscle pair , suggesting that the effect 224 is autonomous to muscles that have transitioned to a progressively deteriorated state . For example , 225 a pair in which VL3 is class 1 and VL4 is class 3 , only the class 3 muscle had aberrant postsynaptic 226 F - actin accumulation . Therefore , the F - actin cytoskeleton at the muscle postsynapse is initially 227 impacted and progressively deteriorates , similar to the deterioration seen in the sarcomeres in 228 DmCFL KD muscles . 229 230 Balakrishnan et al . , showed that DmCFL KD class 3 muscles have protein aggregates containing 231 actin and the Z - disc protein alpha - actinin , similar to nemaline bodies . By transmission electron 232 microscopy ( TEM ) , these structures were not as electron - dense as the rods seen in diseased human 233 9 muscle ( Balakrishnan et al . , 2020 ) . To test whether these nemaline body - like structures occur at 234 the NMJ , we used TEM to examine the ultrastructure of the postsynaptic domain . Samples were 235 dissected and sectioned longitudinally to reveal a sagittal view of the neuronal boutons and 236 underlying muscle , including the postsynaptic actin network and sarcomeres . In control muscles , 237 we observed actin filaments below the bouton organized parallel to each other ( Fig . 4C ) . The 238 postsynaptic actin organization below the bouton was lost in DmCFL KD . In addition , we found 239 that there is a deformation of the synaptic cleft , the space between the bouton and the SSR 240 membrane , in the DmCFL KD muscle . Importantly , the actin - capping protein tropomodulin 241 ( Tmod ) was clearly present in the control , but it was greatly reduced in all DmCFL KD classes 242 and became disorganized in classes 2 and 3 ( Fig . 4D ) . Thus , the actin - binding protein Tmod did 243 not display an accumulation pattern in DmCFL KD muscles , despite the observed actin 244 accumulation in the postsynaptic domain . 245 246 As visualized by confocal microscopy and TEM , postsynaptic actin accumulates and is 247 disorganized in DmCFL KD deteriorated muscles , surrounding the boutons in class 2 and 3 but 248 not in class 1 muscles . 249 250 Reduction of DmCFL in muscle affects postsynaptic morphology as muscles deteriorate 251 252 Genetic manipulations of other muscle actin - binding and regulatory proteins affect NMJ 253 development leading to morphology abnormalities , such as reduced bouton number and Dlg 254 disorganization ( Lee and Schwarz , 2016 ; Pielage et al . , 2006 ; Ramachandran et al . , 2009 ; Xing et 255 al . , 2018 ) . Thus , we sought to characterize NMJ morphology in DmCFL KD muscles . 256 257 The motor neuron properly innervated all DmCFL KD groups by the wandering third instar stage 258 ( Fig . 5A ) . The NMJ span along the muscle cell was unchanged ( Fig . 5B ) . We did not observe any 259 changes in the number of large Ib boutons in DmCFL KD muscles ( Fig . 5C ) . To evaluate the 260 postsynaptic SSR , we measured SSR area by taking the ratio of Dlg - positive area to the combined 261 cell area of the muscle pair . Area quantification was done for group 1 or 2 VL3 / 4 muscle pairs , as 262 cell area is difficult to quantify reliably when muscle cell integrity is severely compromised in 263 group 3 . We did not find a significant difference in SSR coverage when comparing the DmCFL 264 10 KD to control ( Fig . 5D ) . Morphologically , however , we detected differences in the postsynaptic 265 organization : despite Dlg being properly organized around the boutons in class 1 KD muscles , it 266 became increasingly disorganized in class 2 and 3 muscles , showing a more diffuse pattern ( Fig . 267 5E ) . The disorganization in class 2 muscles was not enough to alter the mean SSR coverage 268 compared to control . The range of disruption in Dlg organization over the three classes suggests 269 that postsynaptic structural integrity deteriorates progressively , similar to defects seen in 270 postsynaptic F - actin and the sarcomeres in the DmCFL KD model . 271 272 Together , these data indicate normal presynaptic innervation when DmCFL is reduced in the 273 muscle , whereas the postsynaptic architecture became progressively disorganized as the muscle 274 deteriorates over time in the DmCFL KD model . 275 276 Presence of presynaptic Brp and postsynaptic GluRIIC is unaffected by muscle DmCFL KD 277 278 Excitation - contraction coupling is the process by which synaptic signaling from the motor neuron 279 bouton is communicated to the muscle to drive contraction . In Drosophila , this neurotransmission 280 relies on glutamatergic signaling , while in vertebrates excitation occurs via acetylcholine . At the 281 presynaptic active zone , a consolidation of proteins , including the core active zone scaffold 282 Bruchpilot ( Brp ) , orchestrate synaptic vesicle docking and release of glutamate ( Wagh et al . , 283 2006 ) . In the postsynaptic SSR membrane , the excitatory neurotransmitter binds to glutamate 284 receptors ( GluR ) . These receptors are heterotetramers , with essential subunits GluRIIC , D , and E , 285 and an optional fourth subunit of either GluRIIA or GluRIIB ( DiAntonio , 2006 ) . To test whether 286 there were changes in NMJ signaling machinery are affected in DmCFL KD muscles , we analyzed 287 Brp and the essential GluRIIC subunit . 288 289 While our RNA sequencing results indicated an over three - fold increase in brp gene expression 290 ( Fig . 2D ) , we found that Brp protein in NMJ presynaptic boutons was not detectably changed in 291 DmCFL KD NMJs compared to control ( Fig . 6A - B ) . Likewise , the postsynaptic GluRIIC protein 292 level was unchanged in DmCFL KD muscles , suggesting that there was no change in the total 293 amount of glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic membrane ( Fig . 6C ) . No gross differences were 294 detected in the apposition of GluR to Brp ( Fig . 6A ) . 295 11 296 These results suggest that the DmCFL KD does not affect protein levels nor organization of 297 presynaptic active zone Brp or the postsynaptic GluRs at the NMJ , despite highly increased RNA 298 expression of NMJ genes being identified by transcriptomic analysis . Given that there is diversity 299 in GluR subunit composition that impacts GluR channel properties , we pursued further synaptic 300 analyses in DmCFL KD . 301 302 DmCFL KD disrupts glutamate receptor composition and neurotransmission 303 304 A previous screen examining lethal mutants qualitatively identified various cytoskeleton - related 305 genes that specifically affect GluRIIA subunit levels detected by immunofluorescence ( Liebl and 306 Featherstone , 2005 ) . GluRIIA - containing receptors in the postsynaptic domain are selectively 307 regulated by Coracle via the cortical actin cytoskeleton ( Chen et al . , 2005 ; Song et al . , 2022 ) . 308 Moreover , actin monomer - binding protein twinfilin mutants have decreased abundance of 309 GluRIIA - containing receptors at the NMJ ( Wang et al . , 2010 ) . Since DmCFL is an actin - binding 310 and severing protein , we hypothesized that muscle DmCFL KD could selectively affect GluRIIA 311 levels . 312 313 To test this hypothesis , we quantified GluRIIA using immunofluorescence , and we found that there 314 was less GluRIIA in DmCFL KD muscles compared to control ( 66 % ; Fig . 7A ) . Stratifying the data 315 by muscle pair class combination showed that GluRIIA is only decreased in group 2 or 3 muscle 316 ( Fig . 7B ) . SIM imaging revealed that glutamate receptors containing GluRIIA were properly 317 located at the NMJ postsynaptic domain in class 1 muscles , but the field of these receptors was 318 expanded and mislocalized at some postsynaptic densities in class 2 and class 3 muscles ( Fig . 7C ) . 319 GluRIIA , unlike other GluR subunits , is anchored to the actin cytoskeleton by Coracle ( Chen et 320 al . , 2005 ) . Consistent with the Coracle regulatory mechanism , we found that DmCFL KD muscles 321 have reduced Coracle in the postsynaptic domain , suggesting a possible mechanism for altered 322 GluRIIA localization at the NMJs of DmCFL KD muscles ( Fig . 7D ) . 323 324 GluRIIA - containing receptors mediate the strength of the muscle postsynaptic response , with 325 reduced GluRIIA selectively impairing NMJ neurotransmission strength ( DiAntonio et al . , 1999 ; 326 12 Petersen et al . , 1997 ) . To examine neurotransmission in DmCFL KD muscle , we used two - 327 electrode voltage - clamp ( TEVC ) recordings to measure glutamate release and GluR activation 328 ( Leahy et al . , 2023 ) . The motor neuron was stimulated at suprathreshold voltages with a glass 329 suction electrode at 0 . 2 Hz , and 10 consecutive evoked excitatory junction ( EJC ) traces were 330 recorded ( Fig . 7E ) and then averaged to calculate the mean neurotransmission strength in the 331 DmCFL KD compared to control ( Fig . 7F ) . To get a varied sample of the electrophysiological 332 profile of DmCFL KD muscles , a mix of the different muscle class combinations were tested by 333 TEVC in a blinded configuration . Compared to control , the overall EJC amplitude of DmCFL KD 334 muscles was significantly lower ( about 60 % reduced ; Fig . 7E , F ) . Interestingly , all DmCFL KD 335 muscles had a decreased EJC amplitude and , therefore , similarly reduced neurotransmission 336 strength . This indicates that NMJ function was impaired independent of muscle degeneration when 337 DmCFL levels are reduced . 338 339 These findings indicate that DmCFL KD NMJs have decreased levels of GluRIIA - containing 340 receptors , with mislocalization of the receptors into extra - synaptic muscle regions and a 341 concomitant reduction in synaptic transmission amplitude shown by direct voltage - clamp 342 electrophysiology recording . 343 344 Discussion 345 346 Cofilin - 2 , an actin - severing protein , has been linked to NM . While NM is often characterized as a 347 disease of the sarcomere , other actin dependent structures and functions in the muscle have not 348 been investigated . Consistent with its known role in human NM , we have shown that DmCFL 349 plays a critical role in sarcomerogenesis and muscle maintenance ( Balakrishnan et al . , 2020 ) . 350 Here , we investigated an additional role of CFL in regulating actin at the NMJ . We show that 351 DmCFL is located at the postsynaptic domain and that loss of DmCFL results in buildup of 352 postsynaptic F - actin , disorganization of SSR membrane proteins , and mislocalization of the key 353 GluRIIA glutamate receptor subunit . Consistent with these findings , we see reduced NMJ 354 neurotransmission by electrophysiology . Interestingly , these defects occur prior to the onset of 355 advanced sarcomeric decline . We propose that DmCFL is required for proper postsynaptic actin 356 13 dynamics , and , in its absence , the SSR membrane and its components become progressively 357 disorganized . 358 359 As a first step to study the role of DmCFL at the Drosophila NMJ and to determine its postsynaptic 360 localization and reduction in DmCFL KD muscles , we visualized DmCFL in live and fixed tissues 361 using different approaches . DmCFL is found at the postsynapse , which can only be appreciated by 362 examining thin sections and suggests that its localization is fairly restricted in space . We used an 363 innovative three - dimensional approach to quantify proteins at the postsynaptic domain to 364 distinguish from the high levels of DmCFL in the underlying sarcomere . This approach could be 365 applied to other studies of the postsynapse . Postsynaptic quantification , in addition to Western blot 366 of overall muscle levels , revealed that total DmCFL and inactive p - DmCFL are reduced in DmCFL 367 KD . Similarly , phosphorylated cofilin - 2 is absent in the muscles of an NM patient harboring a 368 CFL2 mutation ( Agrawal et al . , 2007 ) . 369 370 In humans , mice , and Drosophila with muscle cofilin defects , muscle structure progressively 371 deteriorates and function declines . Progressive muscle weakness is reported in CFL2 NM cases 372 with some patients showing a deterioration after early childhood and others having severe 373 symptoms present at birth ( Agrawal et al . , 2007 ; Fattori et al . , 2018 ; Ockeloen et al . , 2012 ; Ong et 374 al . , 2014 ) . Cfl2 mouse models also show a progressive decrease in muscle function and an increase 375 in nemaline rods seen on histology ( Agrawal et al . , 2012 ; Gurniak et al . , 2014 ; Mohri et al . , 2019 ; 376 Rosen et al . , 2020 ) . Even in chimeric mice where only some muscle fibers harbor Cfl2 mutations , 377 the mutant fibers deteriorate , indicating that health of surrounding cells does not impact muscle 378 disease progression ( Mohri et al . , 2019 ) . In Drosophila , DmCFL is knocked down in all larval 379 muscles , yet the progression of the deterioration phenotype does not occur in a coordinated fashion 380 across all muscles . We show that the pair of ventral longitudinal muscles VL3 and 4 , which are 381 innervated by the same branch of intersegmental nerve B , do not necessarily exhibit the same 382 extent of deterioration by the end of larval development , as evidenced by the existence of various 383 groups of classes . This finding mirrors the progressive deterioration seen in the chimeric Cfl2 mice , 384 since cofilin - 2 is only affected in select muscles rather than in all tissues like in other Cfl2 mouse 385 models . 386 387 14 Our work demonstrates that both postsynaptic actin and SSR membrane organization deteriorate 388 progressively in DmCFL KD muscles . In vertebrates , actin isoforms have been defined based on 389 their expression : skeletal muscle ( α sk and α ca ) , smooth muscle ( α sm and γ sm ) and cytoplasmic ( β cyto 390 and γ cyto ) [ reviewed by Perrin and Ervasti , 2010 ; Lubit and Schwartz , 1980 ] . Despite the 391 sarcomeric ⍺ - actin isoforms being predominant in skeletal muscle , the non - sarcomeric γ - actin 392 networks play myriad roles in the muscle cell . This isoform is needed for anchoring myofibrils to 393 the muscle membrane , localization of organelles such as the mitochondria and sarcoplasmic 394 reticulum , and as part of the Z - disc ( Craig and Pardo , 1983 ; Gokhin and Fowler , 2011 ; Nakata et 395 al . , 2001 ; Papponen et al . , 2009 ; Pardo et al . , 1983 ; Rybakova et al . , 2000 ) . Additionally , γ cyto is 396 only needed for proper maintenance of the cytoskeleton in muscle but not its development ; 397 nevertheless , its absence does lead to a phenotype similar to centronuclear myopathy ( Belyantseva 398 et al . , 2009 ; Sonnemann et al . , 2006 ) . Given that there are different pools of actin in the muscle 399 cell , cofilin may play a role at the sarcomere engaging with ⍺ - actin and at other locales—like the 400 NMJ—by regulating γ cyto actin . The fact that actin is critical in the muscle for more than sarcomere 401 structure invites further inquiry into how affecting non - sarcomeric actin contributes to NM and 402 defects at the postsynapse . 403 404 In addition , there is a greater increase in F - actin than G - actin seen in the muscles of a Cfl2 knockout 405 mouse model ( Agrawal et al . , 2012 ) . The postsynaptic actin accumulations in the DmCFL KD 406 appear as filamentous swirls surrounding the motor neuron boutons , similar to the structures 407 reported in the act E84K mutant that affects the actin isoform Act57B and the twf 110 mutant that 408 affects actin - severing protein twinfilin ( Blunk et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2010 ) . We found that 409 defects in F - actin at the NMJ in class 2 muscles occurred before sarcomeric deterioration deeper 410 in the muscle , indicating that it is unlikely that sarcomeric actin is the only source of actin 411 accumulating at the NMJ . F - actin accumulations surround only some boutons in class 2 muscles , 412 while all boutons are surrounded by actin in class 3 muscles , confirming that the deterioration is 413 progressive . It is possible that the postsynaptic deterioration may also be progressive in human 414 NM patients , and that accumulations may not be as obvious as the rods seen emanating from the 415 sarcomere because they do not include Z - disc proteins often examined in patient samples . Even 416 using TEM , we found disorganized actin filaments in the postsynaptic region of DmCFL KD 417 muscle which is reminiscent of the cytoplasmic actin disorganization shown in the biopsy from 418 15 one CFL2 NM patient ( Fattori et al . , 2018 ) . We find that actin - binding protein Tmod is reduced at 419 the DmCFL KD postsynapse as well , which may be due to sequestering of Tmod at the cell poles 420 as we have previously reported ( Balakrishnan et al . , 2020 ) . 421 422 Several Drosophila models have shown that the actin cytoskeleton is important for proper SSR 423 formation ( Pielage et al . , 2006 ; Ramachandran et al . , 2009 ; Wang et al . , 2011 ) . While the 424 postsynaptic membrane forms properly initially , the expansion of Dlg at the postsynapse in 425 DmCFL KD class 3 muscles suggests that actin dynamics—regulated by DmCFL severing—are 426 important in maintaining the SSR . We did not see an increase in postsynaptic SSR area in group 1 427 and group 2 pairs likely because only some boutons in class 2 muscles have affected Dlg 428 organization . Dlg is thought to not interact directly with actin , instead being part of a complex with 429 other actin - binding proteins , including adducin / Hts and spectrin ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , Dlg 430 disorganization at the DmCFL KD postsynapse in the most deteriorated muscles is likely due to 431 an effect on the overall complex , rather than the actin accumulation affecting Dlg directly . Cfl2 432 mouse studies report no obvious NMJ defects ; it is possible that a subtle change on the postsynaptic 433 membrane would not be appreciated when only visualizing the motor neuron and acetylcholine 434 receptors ( Agrawal et al . , 2012 ; Gurniak et al . , 2014 ) . Nevertheless , some reports from human 435 NM patient biopsies imaged by TEM report alterations at the postsynapse , including collapsed or 436 dilated primary and secondary synaptic clefts ( Fukuhara et al . , 1978 ; Heffernan et al . , 1968 ; 437 Karpati et al . , 1971 ) . We see a collapse of the synaptic cleft via TEM in the DmCFL KD model . 438 Together , these data suggest that maintaining a certain amount and / or dynamic state of 439 postsynaptic actin is important for retaining SSR structure , and , thus , the increase in actin due to 440 cofilin reduction in the fly model leads to progressive structural deterioration . 441 442 Cofilin and the actin cytoskeleton have been implicated in the trafficking of ionotropic AMPA 443 receptors ( AMPAR ) to dendritic membranes in vertebrates . In fact , it has been suggested that 444 ADF / cofilin activity is needed both for clearing actin that may be in the way of AMPAR insertion 445 and for regulating the new filaments that guide the receptors to the membrane ( Gu et al . , 2010 ; 446 Zhou et al . , 2001 ) . Experimentally , an increase of ADF / cofilin in hippocampal neuron culture led 447 to increased addition of AMPAR to dendritic spines while a decrease resulted in their removal ( Gu 448 et al . , 2010 ) . Work in a Xenopus culture model found that actin is more dynamic near the 449 16 acetylcholine receptors ( AchR ) at the membrane compared to the actin within the myofibrils , and 450 that a balance of active and inactive cofilin near the membrane is required for their proper addition 451 ( Lee et al . , 2009 ) . Data from Drosophila shows that pharmacological stabilization of actin at the 452 NMJ reduces the GluRIIA cluster size ( Chen et al . , 2005 ) . From the current studies in mouse , it is 453 unclear if there is a reduction in AChR levels in Cfl2 knockout mice . Our DmCFL KD experiments 454 indicate that there is not a reduction in the levels of total glutamate receptors as indicated by the 455 GluRIIC subunit present in all receptors , but there is reduced GluRIIA . Using SIM , we show that 456 in class 2 and 3 muscles GluRIIA - containing receptors are being pulled away from or are not 457 properly delivered to the postsynaptic density directly opposing the motor neuron . Coracle links 458 the GluRIIA subunit to the actin cytoskeleton , and its loss reduces levels of GluRIIA ( Chen et al . , 459 2005 ) . We show that there are reduced Coracle levels at the DmCFL KD postsynapse , which is 460 consistent with the reduction in GluRIIA . A similar decrease in GluRIIA and Coracle levels is 461 seen in a mutant of the actin - binding protein twinfilin ( Wang et al . , 2010 ) . Live imaging 462 experiments have revealed that glutamate receptors enter the postsynaptic density from pools 463 around the plasma membrane ; it is possible that without a dynamic actin cytoskeleton , GluRIIA 464 receptors are not transported to the postsynapse ( Rasse et al . , 2005 ) . 465 466 Our electrophysiological profile of DmCFL KD muscles is consistent with decreased levels of 467 GluRIIA at the postsynapse . Electromyogram ( EMG ) studies of NM patients often result in a 468 myopathic pattern with low amplitudes . However , one longitudinal study of 13 NM patients found 469 that after age nine EMG studies of distal muscles began to show neuropathic changes in addition 470 to myopathic changes ( Wallgren - Pettersson et al . , 1989 ) . This suggests that as the disease 471 progresses there is degenerative changes of the motor units with some patients reported to have 472 lacked motor units ; it is also possible that reinnervation by adjacent motor units occurs to result in 473 higher amplitude potentials . One case report speculated that there was a disruption in innervation 474 which could contribute to the formation of rods in the extrafusal muscle fibers ( Karpati et al . , 475 1971 ) . Of note , we did not appreciate any defect in axon pathfinding to its VL3 / 4 muscle target 476 nor axon structure at the level of the presynaptic active zones ; however , the upregulation in 477 presynaptic genes identified by RNA sequencing may suggest that an attempt by the motor neuron 478 to compensate does occur at the final stage of deterioration in the DmCFL KD model . We are 479 17 unable to further investigate this possibility since the larvae begin the process of pupation after the 480 third - instar wandering stage . 481 482 While our study focuses on a cofilin NM model , the patient case reports suggest that NMJ defects 483 may be found in NM more broadly . Future studies should examine NM patient biopsy and 484 electrophysiological results with more consideration for the specific gene mutated , which was not 485 possible in previous decades . The DmCFL KD model should encourage further study into the role 486 of the NMJ in NM disease progression and potential therapeutics ( Fisher et al . , 2022 ) . There are 487 reports from individual NM patients that use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can lead to clinical 488 improvement ( Natera - de Benito et al . , 2016 ) . One possibility for the improvement is that 489 increased presence of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft increases the probability that the 490 neurotransmitter will find receptor along the simplified postsynaptic membrane , thereby 491 increasing NMJ signal transmission . New acetylcholinesterase inhibitors , such as C - 547 , that are 492 more specific for the NMJ region show promise as they would limit off - target side effects of 493 treatment ( Petrov et al . , 2018 ) . Further study is needed into which pharmacologic treatments may 494 work for NM . The fact that the Drosophila NMJ is a glutamatergic synapse poses a challenge in 495 testing potential treatments that impact acetylcholine ; however , fly models allow a simple system 496 to further interrogate the basic science underpinnings of disease mechanism . Our findings suggest 497 that NMJ defects are seen when muscle cofilin is reduced , which brings forth the alternative that 498 druggable targets of actin - binding proteins could be screened in the fly . In addition , we observed 499 NMJ structural deterioration in the most affected muscles , and thus EMG in tandem with nerve 500 conduction studies and biopsies from older CFL2 NM patients would be informative about disease 501 progression and health of the NMJ . 502 503 In conclusion , our data point to changes at the NMJ , specifically the postsynapse , as being a part 504 of the deterioration that results from affecting muscle cofilin levels . Affecting non - sarcomeric 505 actin dynamics may affect other muscle functions that then contribute to the progression of muscle 506 deterioration seen in NM , opening new avenues for understanding and ameliorating the condition . 507 508 Materials and Methods 509 Drosophila husbandry , stocks , and crosses 510 18 511 All stocks and crosses were raised on standard cornmeal at 25°C on a 12 - hour light / 12 - hour dark 512 light cycle under humidity control . All experiments were done in wandering L3 larvae of both 513 sexes reared at 25°C . DmCFL was knocked down specifically in muscle , as done in our previous 514 study ( Balakrishnan et al . , 2020 ) , by leveraging the Gal4 - UAS system ( Brand and Perrimon , 515 1993 ) . The muscle - specific driver Mhc - Gal4 ( BDSC # 67044 ) was used to drive UAS - mCherry 516 RNAi ( for control , BDSC # 35785 ) or UAS - tsr TRiP RNAi ( for DmCFL knockdown , BDSC 517 # 65055 ) generated by the Transgenic RNAi Project ( TRiP ; Perkins et al . , 2015 ) . Live imaging 518 experiments were done with larvae expressing tsr : : GFP ( ZCL2393 , Kyoto Stock Center DGRC 519 # 110875 ) generated by the FlyTrap : GFP Protein Trap Database ( Morin et al . , 2001 ) . 520 521 RNA - sequencing analysis 522 523 RNA - sequencing of control and DmCFL KD larvae as described previously ( Zapater I Morales et 524 al . , 2023 ) . Eight to ten late third instar larvae of each genotype were dissected in triplicate . 525 Read counts data were assessed and plotted with the integrated Differential Expression and 526 Pathway analysis ( iDEP ) web application ( versions 0 . 96 and 1 . 1 ; Ge et al . , 2018 ) . DESeq2 527 analysis was performed with the following parameters : false discovery rate of 0 . 05 and minimum 528 two - fold change ( Love et al . , 2014 ) . Overrepresentation analysis was done using the Gene Set 529 Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA ) method to identify the top 20 enriched pathways defined by Gene 530 Ontology ( GO ) Biological Processes ( BP ) gene sets when considering the top 2000 genes at a false 531 discovery rate of 0 . 05 . 532 533 Western blot 534 535 Five to ten wandering late third - instar larvae were dissected in HL3 . 1 buffer as has been previously 536 described in ( Brent et al . , 2009 ) to produce muscle - enriched preparations , which were then lysed 537 in larval lysis buffer ( 50 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % NP40 , 0 . 1 % SDS ) 538 supplemented with cOmplete mini protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , # 11836153001 ) and 539 PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , # 4906837001 ) . Ten micrograms from control 540 and DmCFL KD lysates were run on a 12 . 5 % polyacrylamide gel , then transferred to a 541 19 nitrocellulose membrane ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , PI88018 ) . Blocking was done in 5 % milk or 542 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in TBST ( Tris - buffered saline + 0 . 1 % Tween ) for 1 hour at room 543 temperature . Primary antibody staining was performed in Stamina Antibody Dilution Buffer 544 ( KindleBiosciences , R2004 ) overnight at room temperature using 1 : 1000 for rabbit anti - Twinstar 545 ( DmCFL , gift from Tadashi Uemura ) ; 1 : 1000 for rabbit anti - phospho - Twinstar ( p - DmCFL , gift 546 from Tadashi Uemura ) ; and 1 : 1000 for mouse anti - GAPDH ( Abcam , # ab9484 ) . Secondary 547 antibody incubation was performed in 5 % milk for 1 hour at room temperature using 1 : 5000 for 548 anti - rabbit - HRP ( Jackson Immunoresearch , 711 - 035 - 152 ) or anti - mouse - HRP ( Jackson 549 Immunoresearch , 715 - 035 - 151 ) . Blot was imaged using the KwikQuant Imager ( Kindle 550 Biosciences , D1001 ) using 1 - Shot Digital - ECL ( Kindle Biosciences , R1003 ) and intensities were 551 quantified using FIJI Gel Analyzer tool ( NIH ) . Protein expression was normalized to GAPDH 552 loading control within each sample and repeated in triplicate . 553 554 Quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( q - PCR ) 555 556 Total RNA was extracted from ten late third - instar wandering larvae muscle - enriched preparations 557 ( dissected as described in western blot methods ) using TRIzol reagent ( ThermoFisher # 15596026 ) 558 and was subsequently cleaned using the TURBO DNA - free Kit ( Ambion , AM1907 ) . Reverse 559 transcription was done to synthesize cDNA using the SuperScript III First - Strand Synthesis 560 System for RT - PCR ( Invitrogen # 18080 - 051 ) kit . PCR reactions were run on the CFX Opus 96 561 Real - Time PCR System using SYBR Select Master Mix for CFX ( Applied Biosystems # 4472937 ) 562 in biological and technical triplicate . Primers used for tsr : ( forward ) 563 GCTCTCAAGAAGTCGCTCGT ; ( reverse ) GCAATGCACAGTGCTCGTAC . The delta - delta Ct 564 method was used to calculate fold changes with Rpl32 as the normalization control . Reported 565 values represent the log 2 fold change of the gene in DmCFL KD compared to expression in control 566 samples . 567 568 Dissection and immunostaining 569 570 Third - instar larvae at the wandering stage were dissected as previously described in ( Azevedo et 571 al . , 2016 ; Brent et al . , 2009 ) to expose the body wall muscles . Fixation was done using 4 % 572 20 paraformaldehyde in HL3 . 1 buffer for 15 minutes at room temperature for all antibodies except 573 GluRIIA for which Bouin’s fixative was used for 5 min at room temperature . Samples were 574 blocked in BSA - PBT ( PBS supplemented with 0 . 1 % BSA and 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 ) for 30 minutes 575 at room temperature , then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C and subsequently 576 washed in BSA - PBT . Samples were then incubated with Alexa Fluor - conjugated secondary 577 antibodies , phalloidin and goat Alexa - 647 conjugated horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ; Jackson 578 Immunoresearch cat no . 123 - 605 - 021 ) at a concentration of 1 : 400 . Alexa Fluor 555 conjugates 579 secondary antibodies were used for all intensity quantifications . Final washes were done in PBT 580 prior to mounting in Prolong Gold ( Invitrogen , P36930 ) . All slides were cured for at least 24 hours 581 at room temperature prior to imaging . 582 583 Primary antibodies used in this study include rabbit anti - tsr ( DmCFL , concentration 1 : 500 , gift 584 from Tadashi Uemura ( Niwa et al . , 2002 ) against C - terminal peptide CREAVEEKLRATDRQ ; 585 rabbit anti - p - Cofilin ( concentration 1 : 500 , gift from Tadashi Uemura ) against N - terminal peptide 586 ( acetyl - A ( pS ) GVTVSDC ; mouse anti - Discs large ( concentration 1 : 100 , DSHB 4F3 ) ; mouse anti - 587 Bruchpilot ( concentration 1 : 250 , DSHB nc82 ) ; rabbit anti - GluRIIC ( concentration 1 : 1000 , gift 588 from Aaron DiAntonio ) ; mouse anti - GluRIIA ( concentration 1 : 100 , DSHB 8B4D2 , MH2B ) ; rat 589 anti - Tmod ( concentration 1 : 200 , gift from Velia Fowler ) ; guinea pig anti - Coracle ( concentration : 590 1 : 1500 , gift from Richard Fehon ) . 591 592 Confocal imaging 593 594 All samples for comparison were imaged with the same settings between genotypes . Pairs of 595 ventral longitudinal muscles 3 and 4 ( muscles 6 and 7 ) from abdominal hemisegments 2 - 4 were 596 imaged for all experiments . For DmCFL KD , muscle pairs were only imaged if one muscle was 597 class 1 or 2 . Z stack images were acquired using an upright Leica Stellaris 5 laser - scanning 598 confocal microscope with dry HC PL Apo 20X / 0 . 75 CS2 , oil HC PL Apo 63X / 1 . 40 CS2 , or oil 599 HC PL Apo 100X / 1 . 40 CS2 objectives and HyD S detector ( Leica Microsystems ) . Images were 600 acquired sequentially by stack scanning bidirectionally at 400 Hz , with a pixel size of 283 . 95 nm 601 x 283 . 95 nm and an area size of 2048 x 1024 pixels in Leica LASX software and saved as LIF 602 files . For all images the pinhole size was 92 . 53 µm , calculated at 1 A . U . for 561 nm emission . 603 21 Images were acquired with step sizes of 1 μm ( for 20X ) or 0 . 5 μm ( for 63X or 100X ) . For all 604 images for postsynaptic intensity , Z - stack was determined using the HRP channel with the start 605 before and the end 1 μm below the last appreciable HRP signal . FIJI was used to create sum slices 606 or maximum intensity Z projections ( NIH ) . 607 608 Live sample imaging 609 610 Live samples were imaged using a Leica Stellaris 5 laser - scanning confocal microscope with a 611 water HC FLUOTAR L VISIR 25X / 0 . 95 objective and HyD S detector ( Leica Microsystems ) . 612 Larvae were dissected and pinned to expose ventral muscles and imaged live in ambient 613 temperature while the larvae were maintained in ice - cold HL3 . 1 buffer . Images were acquired 614 sequentially by stack scanning bidirectionally at 400 Hz , with a pixel size of 283 . 95 nm x 283 . 95 615 nm and an area size of 2048 x 1024 pixels in Leica LASX software and saved as LIF files . For all 616 images the pinhole size was 92 . 53 µm , calculated at 1 A . U . for 561 nm emission . Z - stacks were 617 taken using a 1 μm step size and sum slices Z projections were created using FIJI ( NIH ) . 618 619 Structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) imaging 620 621 All samples were imaged with the same settings on a Zeiss Elyra 7 with Lattice SIM 2 confocal 622 microscope with a Plan - Apochromat 63X / 1 . 4 Oil DIC M27 objective . Images were acquired 623 sequentially by stack with a pixel size of 0 . 06 µm x 0 . 06 µm and an area size of 80 . 1 µm by 80 . 1 624 µm in ZEN Black software and saved as CZI files . Images were taken with 13 phases and 625 reconstructed using ZEN Black software at the “strong” sharpness setting ( Zeiss ) . The Z stacks 626 were acquired at a step size of 0 . 329 μm and sum slices Z - projections were made using FIJI ( NIH ) . 627 628 NMJ intensity analyses 629 630 Postsynaptic intensity measurements were done using Imaris 10 . 0 ( Bitplane ) . A three - dimensional 631 surface for the HRP source channel was generated for each Z stack image with a surface detail 632 grain level of 0 . 18 μm , smoothing enabled , and auto - thresholding ( Fig . S3A - B ) . Small surfaces 633 that were not part of the NMJ were removed . For Brp quantification , the sum of the sum intensity 634 22 of the Brp channel was normalized to the total HRP volume and compared between genotypes . 635 For DmCFL , p - DmCFL , GluRIIC , GluRIIA intensity measurements , an expanded volume was 636 used . A mask was created from the HRP surface using the Distance Transform setting . A second 637 surface was made using the distance transform mask , with a surface detail level of 0 . 18 and a 638 manual threshold of 0 to 0 . 5 to limit the surface to a shell extending from the edge of the HRP 639 surface to 0 . 5 μm away ( Fig . S3C - F ) . The sum of the sum intensity within this expanded surface 640 was normalized to the expanded volume . 641 642 NMJ morphology measurements : bouton counts , NMJ span , subsynaptic reticulum ( SSR ) 643 area 644 645 The Dlg channel was used to quantify NMJ morphology in FIJI ( NIH ) . The number of boutons in 646 a Z - stack image was manually counted using the Cell Counter plugin . NMJ span was measured by 647 drawing a line parallel to the length of the NMJ and normalizing to the length of muscle VL3 ( 6 ) 648 or VL4 ( 7 ) based on whichever was longer . Cell length was determined by drawing a polygon 649 around the phalloidin - positive shape of each muscle cell and then using the “length” measurement . 650 SSR area was defined as Dlg - positive area normalized to total summed cell areas of muscle 6 and 651 7 . Dlg - positive area was measured by creating a binary mask of the Dlg channel using the Yen 652 thresholding method and recording the area . Cell area was determined by drawing a polygon 653 around the phalloidin - positive shape of each muscle cell and then using the “length” measurement . 654 655 Electron microscopy 656 657 Wandering L3 larvae were dissected as described above and fixed overnight in 2 . 5 % 658 glutaraldehyde at 4°C . Larval filets were trimmed to remove the head and tail and to retain the 659 ventral body wall muscles on both sides . Samples were washed three times in 0 . 1M sodium 660 cacodylate buffer and then post - fixed in 1 % osmium tetroxide for 1 hour at room temperature on 661 a rotator . Next , samples were washed three times in 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate buffer for 10 minutes 662 each wash at room temperature . A dehydration series in ethanol was conducted for 10 minutes at 663 room temperature in each of the following : 30 , 50 , 70 , 85 , 95 , 100 , and 100 % ethanol . Infiltration 664 was done in four steps : first in a solution of 1 : 1 acetonitrile and 100 % ethanol for 10 minutes at 665 23 room temperature followed by infiltration in only acetonitrile for 10 minutes at room temperature . 666 Samples were incubated in a 1 : 1 mixture of acetonitrile and Embed - 812 resin for 30 minutes at 667 room temperature , and then incubated in only Embed - 812 resin overnight . In a semi - hardened 668 resin block , larvae were oriented so that the longitudinal edge was along the cutting face of the 669 block . The block was polymerized for 48 hours at 60°C . Thick sagittal sections of 5 - 10 μm were 670 taken and stained with Toluidine Blue until muscles that were oriented in a longitudinal direction 671 were identified ( Fig . S4 ) . A Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome with diamond knife was used to 672 take 70 nm ultrathin sections which were then collected on 3 mm diameter mesh copper grids . 673 Images of individual boutons and the underlying muscle were taken on a JEOL JEM - 1400 674 transmission electron microscope at 100 kV . 675 676 Two - electrode voltage - clamp ( TEVC ) electrophysiology 677 678 TEVC recordings were done on dissected wandering third instars as previously reported ( Leahy et 679 al . , 2023 ) . Briefly , all recording were done at 18 o C in physiological saline ( in mM ) : 128 NaCl , 2 680 KCl , 4 MgCl2 , 1 . 0 CaCl2 , 70 sucrose , and 5 HEPES ( pH 7 . 2 ) . Longitudinally dissected larvae had 681 internal organs removed and peripheral motor nerves cut at the ventral nerve cord ( VNC ) base . 682 The body walls were glued down ( Vetbond , 3M ) . The preparation was imaged with a 40X water - 683 immersion objective on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope . Ventral longitudinal muscle 6 in abdominal 684 segments 3 or 4 was impaled with two intracellular electrodes ( 1 mm outer diameter borosilicate 685 capillaries ; World Precision Instruments , 1B100F - 4 ) of ∼ 15 MΩ resistance ( 3M KCl ) . The muscle 686 was voltage clamped at −60 mV using an Axoclamp - 2B amplifier ( Axon Instruments ) , and the 687 motor nerve stimulated with a fire - polished glass suction electrode using 0 . 5 ms suprathreshold 688 voltage stimuli at 0 . 2 Hz from a Grass S88 stimulator . Nerve stimulation – evoked excitatory 689 junction current ( EJC ) recordings were filtered at 2 kHz . To quantify EJC amplitude , 10 690 consecutive traces were averaged , and the average peak value recorded . Clampex 9 . 0 was used for 691 all data acquisition , and Clampfit 10 . 7 was used for all data analyses ( Axon Instruments ) . 692 693 Statistical analysis 694 695 24 Pairwise comparisons between groups were performed using a two - tailed student’s t test with an 696 alpha of 0 . 05 using R statistical software ( R Core Team , 2021 ) . Plots were generated using the 697 ggplot2 R package ( Wickham , 2009 ; Wickham , 2016 ) . Figures report the mean ± standard 698 deviation in addition to sample size . 699 700 Acknowledgements 701 We thank the Baylies lab members , M . Balakrishnan , M . Lopez , P . Agrawal , A .
