Additional endogenous vitamin D production after exposure to ultraviolet - B ( UVB ) light might allow the animals to utilize minerals in a more efficient manner , as well as enable the production of functional vitamin D - enriched meat for human consumption . In this study , growing pigs ( n = 16 ) were subjected to a control group or to a daily narrowband UVB exposure of 1 standard erythema dose ( SED ) for a period of 9 weeks until slaughter at a body weight of 105 kg . Transcriptomic profiling of liver with emphasis on the associated effects on vitamin D metabolism due to UVB exposure were evaluated via RNA sequencing . Serum was analyzed for vitamin D status and health parameters such as minerals and biochemical markers . The serum concentration of calcidiol , but not calcitriol , was significantly elevated in response to UVB exposure after 17 days on trial . No effects of UVB exposure were observed on growth performance and blood test results . At slaughter , the RNA sequencing analyses following daily UVB exposure revealed 703 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) in liver tissue ( adjusted p - value < 0 . 01 ) . Results showed that molecular pathways for vitamin D synthesis ( CYP2R1 ) rather than cholesterol synthesis ( DHCR7 ) were preferentially initiated in liver . Gene enrichment ( p < 0 . 05 ) was observed for reduced cholesterol / steroid biosynthesis , SNARE interactions in vesicular transport , and CDC42 signaling . Taken together , dietary vitamin D supply can be complemented via endogenous production after UVB exposure in pig husbandry , which could be considered in the development of functional foods . 1 . Introduction Vitamin D plays a critical role in bone development by maintaining calcium - phosphate homeostasis [ 1 , 2 ] and has a wide range of important biological functions in the body , including metabolism , growth , immu - nity , and the antioxidative status [ 3 , 4 ] . In pigs , vitamin D forms can be directly obtained from the dietary sources or produced in the body following the skin exposure to solar ultraviolet - B ( UVB ) [ 5 – 8 ] . During exposure to solar light , UVB ( 290 – 315 nm ) is absorbed in the skin to convert endogenously produced provitamin D 3 ( 7 - dehydrocholesterol ) to previtamin D 3 [ 9 ] . Subsequently , the previtamin D 3 is rapidly converted to vitamin D 3 ( cholecalciferol ) . Once cholecalciferol is pro - duced in the skin or obtained from the diet , it enters the circulation and undergoes 25 - hydroxylation via vitamin D 25 - hydroxylase ( encoded by CYP2R1 ) to form 25 ( OH ) D 3 , also known as calcidiol , in liver . The liver is also the specific site where the vitamin D binding protein ( encoded by GC ) is produced to distribute calcidiol throughout the body via circu - lation [ 10 ] . Calcidiol is further hydroxylated ( 1 α - hydroxylation ) in kidney via 25 - hydroxyvitamin D 1 - α - hydroxylase ( encoded by CYP27B1 ) to form 1 , 25 ( OH ) 2 D 3 , also known as calcitriol , for activation [ 4 , 11 ] . There is a body of evidence that calcitriol can affect the expression of more than 900 genes in a tissue - specific manner [ 12 – 14 ] .

In pigs , exposure to sunlight or artificial UVB has been demonstrated to elevate the serum level of calcidiol in circulation [ 6 , 16 ] . Exposure to sunlight for one hour daily at midday ( 41 . 3114 ◦ N , 105 . 5911 ◦ W ; 2184 m ) increased the serum concentrations of calcidiol in pigs by up to 200 % [ 5 ] . Also , a short - term application of 6 min daily has been shown to be effective [ 5 – 8 ] . Recent evidence suggests that direct UVB exposure of pigs can also elevate cholecalciferol and calcidiol levels in muscle and adipose tissue , which may enable the fortification in functional meat products for human consumption [ 6 , 8 , 17 ] . The total radiation received can be represented in standard eryth - emal dose units ( SED ) , with 1 SED equaling 100 J / m 2 erythemally effective radiation [ 18 ] . This standard unit is a fixed measure and in - dependent of the skin type and species . At the latitude of 55 degrees north ( 55 ◦ N ) , 1 SED is equal to 10 min of sun exposure at the zenith in summertime [ 19 ] . Natural or artificial UVB exposure of animals with 1 SED results in higher cholecalciferol and calcidiol levels in the blood compared to animals relying on dietary vitamin D 3 at 2000 IU / kg feed [ 20 , 21 ] . According to Barnkob et al . , UVB exposure of pigs at 1 SED results in higher amounts of vitamin D 3 levels in various body com - partments such as serum , skin , subcutaneous fat , lean meat , and liver compared to exposure at 0 . 3 and 0 . 7 SED [ 22 ] . Apart from this , a 7 - sec - ond exposure of pigs to UVB light can produce 0 . 5 µ g of vitamin D 3 per cm 2 of skin [ 23 ] . Under the conditions that pigs might be increasingly exposed to sunlight e . g . in housing systems with outdoor access , the question arises how this will affect the endogenous vitamin D meta - bolism . Various consequences on management and feeding of pig herds are conceivable . This could comprise appropriate modifications of the nutritional mineral and vitamin D supply or additional value - adding opportunities through the fortification of vitamin D in meat . We hypothesized that UVB exposure contributes to the increase in systemic levels of vitamin D 3 metabolites and might impact on zoo - technical performance parameters secondary to the direct effects on cholecalciferol synthesis in the skin . Thus , this is the first study to pro - vide a holistic transcriptome profile of liver tissue to investigate hepatic responses to UVB exposure in pigs compared to untreated controls . This approach enabled the uncovering of effector molecules and genes involved in hepatic vitamin D 3 metabolism . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Animals and diets The entire experiment was performed at the Agri - Food and Biosci - ence Institute ( AFBI ) , UK , received approval from the Ethical Review Body ( Project License Number PPL2751 ) for animal welfare , and was conducted in accordance with the Animals Scientific Procedures Act 1986 . DanBred Duroc boars ( n = 16 ) were assigned to either UVB exposure ( UVB , n = 8 ) or no UVB exposure ( control , n = 8 ) . UVB exposure started at 14 weeks of age ( average body weight ( mean ± SD ) : 46 . 88 ± 3 . 44 kg ) and continued for 9 weeks until slaughter . The pigs were exposed to UVB with a narrow band lamp ( 0 . 11 mW / cm 2 ; Koninklijke Philips N . V . , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) for 30 s daily , which corresponds to 1 SED equivalent to 10 min of natural daylight at 55 ◦ N . All pigs had ad libitum access to basal diets ( Table S1 ) and drinking water . Body weight , average daily weight gain , and feed con - version were recorded . 2 . 2 . Serum and tissue sampling Blood samples were taken from the jugular vein on days 2 and 17 and were allowed to clot for about 30 min prior to centrifugation ( 2200 x g ; 15 min at 4 ◦ C ) . Serum was aliquoted and stored at (cid:0) 80 ◦ until analysis . At an average age of 150 . 9 days , 16 pigs were anesthetized using gas stunning and sacrificed by exsanguination at the Karro Food Group ( Cookstown , UK ) slaughter facility . The back fat thickness and cold carcass weight of the pigs were determined at slaughter and used in combination with the live weight to calculate the kill out percentage . For each individual , two grams of liver sample were collected from the lobus Spigeli , cut into pieces and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately prior to long - term storage at (cid:0) 80 ◦ C . 2 . 3 . Analysis of serum The serum concentration of albumin , alkaline phosphatase , calcium , glucose , inorganic phosphorus , total protein , and total cholesterol was measured by means of the Fuji DriChem 4000i system ( FujiFilm , Minato , Japan ) . The amounts of calcidiol and calcitriol were determined in duplicate for all samples using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA ; calcidiol : EIA - 5396 , DRG instruments GmbH , Marburg , Ger - many ; calcitriol : AC - 62F1 , Immunodiagnostic Systems GmbH , Frankfurt am Main , Germany ) according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol . 2 . 4 . Isolation of RNA , library preparation and RNA sequencing Total RNA was extracted from liver samples using TRI reagent ( Sigma - Aldrich , Taufkirchen , Germany ) and treated with DNaseI for the removal of potential genomic DNA residues as previously described [ 24 ] . The isolated RNA was purified using NucleoSpin RNA II kit ( Macherey - Nagel , Düren , Germany ) and the concentration was measured using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer . Polymerase chain reaction amplification of RNA with beta - actin ( ACTB ) - specific primers ( forward primer : 5 ′ - GAGAAGCTCTGCTACGTCGC - 3 ′ ; reverse primer : 5 ′ - CCTGATGTCCACGTCGCACT - 3 ′ ) was performed to warrant the com - plete absence of genomic DNA in total RNA content . The quality of liver RNA extracts was assessed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 ( Agilent Technol - ogies , Waldbronn , Germany ) , giving RNA integrity numbers of 7 . 0 – 8 . 8 ( average 8 . 1 ) , which allowed further processing of the samples . Stranded mRNA libraries were constructed ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) from purified total RNAs , and their quality was confirmed using an Agilent DNA - 1000 chip kit ( Bioanalyzer 2100 ) . The libraries were sequenced for single reads of 101 bp using an Illumina HiSeq2500 equipment . 2 . 5 . Sequencing data processing and differential gene expression analysis Raw reads were quality verified and preprocessed with FastQC v . 0 . 12 . 0 and Trim Galore v . 0 . 6 . 5 , with low quality reads ( mean Q score 20 ) and adapters removed . The HISAT2 ( v . 2 . 2 . 1 ) [ 25 ] and HTSeq ( v . 2 . 0 . 3 ) [ 26 ] tools were used to map high - quality reads to the reference Sscrofa11 . 1 ( Ensembl Release 109 ) including 35 , 670 genes . The mixO - mics ( v . 6 . 24 . 0 ) R package [ 27 ] was used to perform preliminary data visualization in a principal component analysis of gene expression pat - terns following a variance stabilizing transformation of count data . In addition , overall transcriptional profiles were compared between groups using a distance matrix - based approach implemented in the vegan ( v . 2 . 6 – 2 ) R package . The R package DESeq2 v1 . 40 . 1 was used to identify differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) between UVB and control [ 28 ] . The significance threshold for detecting DEGs between diet groups was set at a Benjamini - Hochberg adjusted p - value of 0 . 01 . To examine sig - nificant biological changes between two groups ( UVB vs control ) , the lists of DEGs ( n = 703 ) were mapped to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) pathways [ release 106 , accessed 23 / 05 / 2023 , reference organism is pig ( Sus scrofa ) ] using the g : Profiler ( v . e109 _ eg56 _ p17 _ 1d3191d ) web server [ 29 ] . In addition , ingenuity pathway analysis ( IPA ) was conducted on the list of DEGs using IPA database ( QIAGEN , Redwood City , CA , USA ) [ 30 ] . Pathways were considered significant at a Benjamini - Hochberg - adjusted p - value less than or equal to 0 . 05 . In addition , genes involved in the synthesis , M . Hasan et al .

Data analyses The data analysis of this experiment was carried out using the open sourced R software ( v4 . 2 . 2 ; R foundation for statistical computing , Vienna , Austria ) . Statistical analyses of zootechnical parameters and serum measurements were performed with a linear model including the two experimental groups ( UVB and control ) as fixed effect and slaughter order as covariate . The graphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism v9 . 2 . 0 ( GraphPad software , San Diego , CA , USA ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Effects of UVB exposure on growth performance and carcass traits The animals examined in this study had a uniform birth weight and comparable weights at the start of UVB treatment at 14 weeks of age . When compared to controls , the UVB exposure showed no significant ( p > 0 . 05 ) impact on the growth performance of the pigs including body weight , average daily weight gain , backfat thickness , and feed conver - sion ratio ( Fig . 1 ) . No significant effect of UVB exposure was observed on the carcass characteristics comprising cold weight and kill out percentage . 3 . 2 . Effects of UVB exposure on serum parameters The UVB exposure demonstrated no significant effect on the serum parameters related to liver integrity , renal function , and mineral ho - meostasis ( Table 1 ) . The serum level of calcidiol was significantly increased following a daily UVB exposure for 17 days compared to the unexposed control group ( p = 0 . 01 ) . The activity of alkaline phospha - tase in serum tended to increase at the initial phase after exposure to UVB for 2 days compared to controls ( p = 0 . 06 ) . 3 . 3 . Effects of UVB exposure on hepatic gene expression profiles The gene expression profiles in liver were assessed after 8 weeks of UVB exposure . The average number of reads per sample was 15 , 876 , 602 and the mean alignment rate was 89 % . The principal component anal - ysis based on gene expression data showed a distinct separation between samples exposed to control and UVB conditions ( Fig . 2 ) . Principal Fig . 1 .

Based on the analysis of variance considering the first two PCs , the UVB exposure had a significant effect on the overall transcriptional profiles ( p = 0 . 004 ) . The differential expression analysis for the com - parison between the control and UVB groups resulted in 703 DEGs ( adjusted p ≤ 0 . 01 ) ( Table S2 ) . 3 . 3 . 1 . Pathway enrichment analysis The DEGs were subjected to biological pathway analysis via IPA and KEGG databases to determine their enrichment in metabolic pathways following the UVB exposure of the pigs ( Table 2 ) . IPA demonstrated a significant enrichment of the superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and cholesterol biosynthesis I , II , and III . The DEGs contributing to the enrichment of these pathways were significantly downregulated ( UVB < control ) in UVB - exposed animals compared to the controls , resulting in a predicted inactivation of the pathways ( Table S3 ) . The CDC42 signaling pathway was also found to be significantly enriched . Additionally , KEGG analysis revealed a significant enrichment of steroid biosynthesis and SNARE ( soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ) interactions in the vesicular transport pathway ( Table S4 ) . 3 . 3 . 2 . Expression profiles of vitamin D metabolism genes Using the RNA sequencing data , the impact of UVB exposure was further assessed regarding the expression of genes responsible for the synthesis , activation , transport , and inactivation of vitamin D metabo - lites in liver ( Table 3 ) . The expression of CYP2R1 was significantly upregulated in UVB - exposed pigs compared to controls ( adjusted p ≤ 0 . 05 ) . The overall expression level of CYP2R1 was moderate . At the Fig . 2 .

The expression of CYP27B1 was unaffected between the experimental groups . Moreover , the expression of the vitamin D receptor encoded by VDR and its heterodimer partners RXRA , RXRB , and RXRG remained unaltered following UVB exposure . Compared to controls , UVB illus - trated no significant impact on the expression of genes linked to trans - port ( GC ) and inactivation ( CYP24A1 ) . The expression of DHCR7 was significantly reduced in pigs exposed to UVB compared with controls ( adjusted p ≤ 0 . 05 ) . 3 . 3 . 3 . Expression profiles of vitamin D target genes The list of 703 DEGs was aligned with a set of 189 validated primary vitamin D target genes [ 13 ] to analyze their transcriptional alteration in the liver in response to UVB exposure ( Table S5 ) . In total , 12 transcripts were found to be significantly differentially expressed in UVB - exposed pigs compared to controls ( adjusted p ≤ 0 . 05 ) ( Table 4 ) . 4 . Discussion Our study demonstrated that UVB exposure shows no significant impact on body weight , average daily weight gain , carcass weight , and yield percentage of the pigs . This is consistent with previous findings where different dosages of UVB ( 0 SED , 0 . 7 SED , 1 SED ) as well as timings of daily UVB exposure ( 2 min , 6 min ) showed non - significant effects on performance data including body weight [ 6 , 8 ] . In the cur - rent study , the backfat thickness , a key carcass composition trait [ 31 , 32 ] in breeding programs , was unaltered between experimental pig groups . This is in agreement with previous results where exposure of the pigs to natural sunlight at solar noon for 2 weeks ( 1 h daily ) during the summer solstice and fall equinox showed no significant impact on the backfat thickness weight [ 6 , 8 ] . However , adipose tissue exhibited higher levels of vitamin D 3 and calcidiol compared to liver and lean meat [ 23 ] , sug - gesting that a number of tissues are involved in maintaining body stores according to specific local demands [ 4 ] . Interestingly , a radiation regimen of 1 kJ / m 2 with 65 % UVB and 35 % UVA exposure of over - weight mice significantly reduced body weight and weight gain when challenged with a high - fat diet [ 33 ] . This phenomenon was also confirmed in other studies on mice [ 34 – 36 ] . Since pig husbandry is also a subject of economic interests , the outcome might be considered in terms of improving metabolic health in proliferative sows . The serum concentration of calcidiol is used to assess the vitamin D status in humans [ 37 ] . In this study , the applied UVB exposure showed to be effective on serum calcidiol levels , but not on serum calcitriol levels , suggesting a short - to medium - term capacity for endogenous synthesis of calcidiol . This is in agreement with previous findings on sows with their piglets [ 38 ] , where calcidiol levels were increased following a daily UVB exposure of 6 h with 0 . 7 and 1 . 0 SED at day 12 and 24 compared to controls . Interestingly , 0 . 7 and 1 SED of UVB showed similar effects on the serum concentration of calcidiol , indi - cating that an upper limit for calcidiol concentration from endogenous synthesis exists . In addition , daily narrowband UVB exposure of 2 min and 6 min for 10 weeks was recently reported to elevate the vitamin D status of slaughtered pigs [ 5 – 8 ] . Therefore , the use of UVB lamps is an effective means of improving vitamin D status at various life stages for pigs , showing efficacy in addition to dietary vitamin D supplementation . However , there is not yet a comprehensive , scientifically validated recommendation for serum calcidiol levels in pigs to ensure bone health and efficient mineral utilization . In addition to presumed genetic factors [ 39 , 40 ] generalizable conclusions are further confounded by the tissue - specific requirement for vitamin D metabolites [ 4 ] . The UVB exposure showed no significant impact on the serum levels of albumin , total protein , total cholesterol , alkaline phosphatase , calcium , inorganic phosphorus , creatinine , and glucose at experimental days 2 and 17 . This suggests that the applied UVB irradiation has no adverse effect on liver integrity and renal function . This is in agreement with previous reports , where serum alkaline phosphatase and minerals were unaltered due to UVB exposure in pigs [ 16 ] . The UVB exposure has been evaluated for transcripts encoding genes related to vitamin D hydroxylation in liver . The higher expression of 25 - hydroxylase CYP2R1 compared to controls corresponds to the elevated serum calcidiol levels [ 41 ] . However , another enzyme known to exhibit 25 - hydroxylase activity , i . e . , to convert cholecalciferol to calcidiol , CYP27A1 , was lowered in expression following UVB exposure compared with controls . Since CYP27A1 is a bifunctional enzyme known to participate in both bile acid and vitamin D metabolism [ 42 ] , its expression patterns may indicate the involvement of UVB exposure in lipid metabolism . Despite known species specificities , there is evidence for yet unknown enzymes exhibiting 25 - hydroxylation activity [ 43 ] .

Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 236 ( 2024 ) 106428 6 expression of GC , which encodes the vitamin D binding protein with the highest affinity to calcidiol [ 44 ] , was unaltered between the experi - mental groups . Given the elevated serum concentration of calcidiol , results reflect the high transportation capacity via GC in the circulation [ 45 ] . The expression pattern is consistent with recent reports , where a low phosphorus diet significantly upregulated the expression of CYP2R1 in the jejunum of pigs compared to controls , whereas no effect was observed in the expression of GC in liver [ 4 ] . Moreover , the expression of CYP27B1 , encoding the 1 α - hydroxylase , was unaffected by UVB exposure indicating no significant effects on hepatic calcitriol produc - tion . For the kidney , as the main production site of systemic calcitriol levels , an unaffected CYP27B1 expression can also be assumed due to the unchanged serum calcitriol levels [ 4 , 46 , 47 ] . However , CYP27B1 is known to be sensitive to low dietary P intake in lactating sows with increased renal expression [ 48 ] . Hepatic expression of CYP24A1 , known for its 24 - hydroxylase activity that induces renal excretion of vitamin D metabolites , was barely detectable in liver tissue and unaltered by UVB exposure . Consistently , CYP24A1 was not expressed in porcine liver as reported previously [ 4 ] . For the vitamin D receptor encoded by VDR and its heterodimer partners RXRA , RXRB , and RXRG [ 49 ] , the UVB expo - sure illustrated no significant impact on their expression . Nevertheless , the analysis revealed that a number of known vitamin D target genes were differentially expressed between the experimental groups . The higher serum calcidiol levels might be attributed to the observed tran - scriptional effects as an improved serum status of calcidiol was associ - ated with several hundred genes in human white blood cells [ 50 ] . Although calcitriol has the highest affinity for VDR , calcidiol also acti - vates VDR at certain serum concentrations with an affinity 100 – 200 times lower than calcitriol [ 51 , 52 ] . However , comprehensive lists of vitamin D target genes in porcine tissues are still missing . The pathway analysis consistently showed the inhibition of the cholesterol / steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway in the liver of UVB - exposed pigs . In fact , the molecular pathways that contribute to the biosynthesis of vitamin D and cholesterol have considerable overlap . Thus , both the serum calcidiol levels and the synthesis of steroid hor - mones such as vitamin D from 7 - dehydrocholesterol indicate that the findings in hepatic gene expression are most probably due to the increased production of calcidiol [ 53 , 54 ] . Specifically , DHCR7 seems to act as a key regulator controlling the balance between cholesterol biosynthesis and vitamin D biosynthesis [ 55 ] . Vitamin D is thought to be involved in reducing cholesterol biosynthesis by decreasing the activity of DHCR7 and affecting cholesterol levels in both , cells and plasma [ 55 ] . Moreover , the current study found that not only DHCR7 but also other genes encoding cholesterol - synthesizing enzymes were altered , thereby limiting cholesterol biosynthesis . Interestingly , several studies are available that show the relationship between vitamin D status and fat metabolism in different contexts [ 56 – 58 ] . Especially genes encoding fatty acid synthase ( FASN ) , acetyl - CoA carboxylase alpha ( ACACA ) , and genes related to fatty acid oxidation , e . g . acetyl - CoA oxidase ( ACOX1 ) , were also shown to be affected by UVB exposure in the current study . Further molecular studies on the liver are needed to clarify the effects of vitamin D metabolites in general and the role of additional UVB - induced calcidiol production in particular on lipid metabolism . The pathway analysis further demonstrated the significant enrichment of the SNARE interactions in vesicular transport pathway . SNARE is a highly conserved protein superfamily that facilitates the membrane fusion and transport of molecules within cells [ 59 ] . Certain SNARE proteins have been shown to facilitate the transport of cholesterol in an in vitro rodent model and thus influence steroidogenesis [ 60 ] . Accordingly , the enrichment of this pathway appears to be a consequence of UVB - induced shifts in the biosynthesis from cholesterol precursors to vitamin D . The biological pathway analysis illustrated significant enrichment of the CDC42 signaling . CDC42 is considered as a member of the RhoGTPase family of intracellular molecular switches involved in several signaling pathways crucial for actomyosin ( actin - myosin complex ) organization within the cytoskeleton [ 61 ] . It is likely that these are secondary effects due to the shift in cholesterol - vitamin D balance [ 62 , 63 ] . 5 . Conclusions Daily UVB exposure significantly increased serum calcidiol levels and thus improved vitamin D status in pigs . In addition , the hepatic gene expression pattern confirms systemic effects of artificial UVB light on vitamin D metabolism . Molecular signaling pathways in liver suggested that endogenous vitamin D synthesis had priority over cholesterol for - mation . Hence , vitamin D obtained from mainly dietary sources can be complemented via endogenous calcidiol synthesis induced by UVB exposure . This paves the way for long - term improvements of mineral utilization and confirms the possibility of producing biofortified animal products for human consumption . Funding Devenish Nutrition Ltd .
