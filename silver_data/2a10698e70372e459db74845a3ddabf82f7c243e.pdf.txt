We show that plasma membrane abun - dance is a key arbiter of these cellular behaviors . Neutrophils and macrophages lacking the G - protein subunit G b 4 exhibit profound plasma membrane expansion due to enhanced pro - duction of sphingolipids . This increased membrane allocation dramatically enhances phagocytosis of bacteria , fungus , apop - totic corpses , and cancer cells . G b 4 deﬁcient neutrophils are also defective in the normal inhibition of migration following cargo uptake . In G b 4 knockout mice , myeloid cells exhibit en - hanced phagocytosis of inhaled fungal conidia in the lung but also increased trafﬁcking of engulfed pathogens to other organs . These results reveal an unexpected , biophysical control mecha - nism lying at the heart of myeloid functional decision - making .

Weiner @ ucsf . edu , Introduction Professional phagocytes of the myeloid lineage , includ - ing neutrophils and macrophages , maintain homeostasis by clearing apoptotic corpses , cellular debris , and invading pathogens ( Wang et al . 2017 ; Peiseler and Kubes 2019 ; Wit - ter , Okunnu , and Berg 2016 ; Pylaeva et al . 2022 ) . These cells are also central components in emerging immunotherapeutic strategies to combat infections , cardiovascular disease , and cancer ( Alvey and Discher 2017 ; Dooling et al . 2023 ; An - drechak , Dooling , and Discher 2019 ; Johansson and Kirse - bom 2021 ) . Phagocytes take up cargo via phagocytosis , an evolutionarily conserved engulfment process that is triggered by the recognition of cognate cargo ligands , such as phos - phatidylserine , complement , or antibodies , by speciﬁc recep - tors on the phagocyte ( Gordon 2016 ) . Target recognition elic - its a dramatic remodeling of the cytoskeleton , which shapes the overlying plasma membrane into a phagocytic cup that surrounds and then internalizes the cargo ( Jaumouille and Wa - terman 2020 ; Mylvaganam , Freeman , and Grinstein 2021 ) . In carrying out their clearance function , myeloid cells exhibit not only robust cargo uptake but also the ability to coordi - nate this activity with other cellular behaviors ( Bretou et al . 2017 ; Chabaud et al . 2015 ; Luo et al . 2009 ; Branzk et al . 2014 ; Yipp et al . 2012 ) . Crosstalk between phagocytosis and cell motility is particularly well - established , with studies documenting an antagonistic relationship between cell mi - gration and engulfment responses in multiple myeloid cell types ( Bretou et al . 2017 ; Chabaud et al . 2015 ; Luo et al . 2009 ) . In neutrophils speciﬁcally , transient arrest following phagocytosis is thought to curtail the dissemination of intra - cellular microbes ( Jhingran et al . 2012 ; Hopke et al . 2020 ; Hamza et al . 2014 ) . Accordingly , any efforts to harness pro - fessional phagocytes therapeutically will require a mechanis - tic understanding of not only phagocytosis itself but also its cross - regulatory effects on other activities . Most prior research on phagocytosis has focused on the biochemical mechanisms that control it , and as a result , much is now known about the molecules that mediate cargo recognition and the signal transduction pathways that drive cup formation and cargo engulfment ( Uribe - Querol and Ros - ales 2020 ) . Phagocytosis is also an intensely physical pro - cess ( Vorselen , Labitigan , and Theriot 2020 ; Jaumouille and Waterman 2020 ) , implying that it might be subject to bio - physical as well as biochemical modes of regulation . In that regard , it is interesting to note that the deformability of both cargo and underlying substrate have been shown to modulate the engulfment behavior of macrophages ( Jain , Moeller , and Vogel 2019 ; Adlerz , Aranda - Espinoza , and Hayenga 2016 ; Blakney , Swartzlander , and Bryant 2012 ; Okamoto et al . 2018 ; Underhill and Goodridge 2012 ; Sosale et al . 2015 ) . Whether the architecture and mechanics of the phagocyte it - self might also inﬂuence cargo uptake is not known , how - ever , and how cell - intrinsic properties of this kind might af - fect functional crosstalk between phagocytosis and other cel - Winer et al . | bioR ‰ iv | September 13 , 2023 | 1 – 27 lular behaviors is completely unexplored . Results G — 4 deﬁciency enhances phagocytic responses against a wide range of targets To identify novel mechanisms controlling phagocytosis and functional crosstalk , we performed a candidate screen fo - cused on heterotrimeric G - protein signaling , which regu - lates phagocytosis and migration in multiple myeloid cell types ( Peracino et al . 1998 ; Wen et al . 2019 ; Pan et al . 2016 ; Cohen et al . 2022 ; Kamber et al . 2021 ; Yamada and Sixt 2019 ; Schwarz et al . 2017 ; Sarris and Sixt 2015 ) . Activating signals induce the dissociation of the G - protein – subunit ( G – ) from the —“ subcomplex ( G —“ ) , freeing both components to bind and activate speciﬁc downstream effector molecules ( Clapham and Neer 1997 ) . The bulk of prior research in this area has focused on G – isoforms , while comparatively less is known about speciﬁc G — and G “ subunits ( Kankanamge et al . 2022 ) . Accordingly , we ap - plied CRISPR - Cas9 to knock out each G — subunit in human neutrophil - like HL - 60 cells ( Fig . 1a and ﬁg . S1a and b ) . Gene targeting was carried out in self - renewing HL - 60 pre - cursors , which were then differentiated into neutrophil - like cells by the addition of DMSO . All terminally differentiated cells were CD15 + CD16 + ( ﬁg . S1c ) , indicating that the ge - netic modiﬁcations we introduced did not prevent HL - 60 pro - genitors from becoming neutrophils . Knockout and control HL - 60 cells were then subjected to phagocytosis assays . As cargo for these experiments , we pre - pared 10 µm diameter IgG - coated polyacrylamide micropar - ticles ( MPs ) ( Vorselen et al . 2020 ; Vorselen et al . 2021 ) derivatized with the ﬂuorescent dyes FITC and LRB ( Fig . 1a and ﬁg . S2 ) . FITC , but not LRB , ﬂuorescence is quenched in acidic phagolysosomes , producing a color change that can be monitored by ﬂow cytometry and ﬂuorescence microscopy . In this manner , we were able to identify G — subunits that either positively or negatively regulated phagocytosis . Con - sistent with prior work ( Cohen et al . 2022 ; Kamber et al . 2021 ) , HL - 60 cells lacking G — 2 exhibited a 50 percent re - duction in particle uptake ( Fig . 1b ) . By contrast , depletion of G — 4 induced a striking 3 - to 4 - fold increase in phagocytosis relative to wild type ( WT ) controls ( Fig . 1b ) . This hyper - phagic behavior was readily apparent in both monocultures as well as cocultures containing a 1 : 1 mixture of WT and G — 4 knockout (   G — 4 ) HL - 60 cells ( ﬁg . S3a - b ) , indicating that the phenotype was cell intrinsic . To ensure that our CRISPR - editing did not generate any off - target effects , we veriﬁed that re - expression of G — 4 on the knock - out background restored phagocytosis to WT levels ( Fig . 1c , ﬁg . S3c ) . Using live imaging , we found that   G — 4 deﬁciency markedly enhanced particle consumption on a per - cell basis ; while the vast ma - jority of phagocytic WT cells took up just one MP , almost half of phagocytic   G — 4 cells engulfed two or more MPs ( Fig . 1d ) . We next leveraged super - resolution microscopy to examine engulfment dynamics in more detail .   G — 4 HL - 60 cells formed stereotypical phagocytic cups featuring a pro - nounced band of ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) at the leading edge ( Fig . 1e ) . This morphology was much less apparent in WT cells , which still engaged MP targets but only achieved full engulfment in less than 50 percent of conjugates . In contrast ,   G — 4 HL - 60 cells completed over 90 percent of their phagocytic attempts and executed engulfment more than twice as fast as their wild - type counterparts ( Fig . 1e , Supple - mentary Video 1 ) . To further explore the scope of the   G — 4 phenotype , we challenged WT and   G — 4 HL - 60 cells with MPs bearing al - ternative coatings , namely phosphatidylserine ( PS ) , comple - ment , IgG , and IgA .   G — 4 cells phagocytosed 2 - to 10 - fold more cargo in each case , indicating that their hyperphagy was not limited to a speciﬁc uptake receptor ( ﬁg . S3d ) . Next , we measured the phagocytosis of four distinct biological tar - gets : the gram - negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Staphylococcus aureus bioparticles , conidia from the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus , and apoptotic Jurkat T cell corpses ( Fig . 1f , ﬁg . S3e - f ) .   G — 4 HL - 60 cells signiﬁcantly out - performed controls in every case , further supporting the idea that G — 4 deﬁciency potentiates phagocytosis against diverse biological cargos . We next investigated whether loss of G — 4 augments the therapeutic phagocytosis of tumors . Many can - cer cells evade immune detection and clearance by express - ing CD47 , a cell surface protein that functions as a “don’t eat me” signal ( Chao , Weissman , and Majeti 2012 ; Logtenberg , Scheeren , and Schumacher 2020 ) . In certain cases , inhibit - ing this “don’t eat me” signal with blocking antibodies or peptides against CD47 or its receptor , SIRP – , is sufﬁcient to stimulate an engulfment response by phagocytes ( Fig . 1g ) ( Willingham et al . 2012 ; Jalil et al . 2020 ; Rodriguez et al . 2013 ) . To adapt this approach to our experimental sys - tem , we challenged HL - 60 cells with Ramos B lymphoma target cells in the absence or presence of anti - CD47 block - ade . In some samples , opsonizing antibodies against the B cell marker CD20 were added to further promote phagocyto - sis via Fc receptor engagement . WT HL - 60 cells did not take up Ramos cells , and treatment with anti - CD47 and / or anti - CD20 failed to enhance their activity . In contrast , G — 4 HL - 60 cells exhibited a low , but measurable level of baseline phago - cytosis , which increased sharply ( 3 - fold ) in the presence of anti - CD47 , and even more so ( 8 - fold ) when anti - CD47 was combined with anti - CD20 ( Fig . 1g ) . Collectively , these re - sults demonstrate that G4 deﬁciency substantially augments phagocytic responses across a wide range of targets . G — 4 deﬁciency alters cell migration and crosstalk be - tween phagocytosis and motility As proper coordination between cargo uptake and motility is essential for myeloid cell function ( Bretou et al . 2017 ; Chabaud et al . 2015 ; Luo et al . 2009 ) , we next investigated the effects of G — 4 on migratory capacity . To this end , we employed a chemotaxis assay in which HL - 60 cells were at - tached to ﬁbronectin - coated glass and then presented with a point source of the peptide chemoattractant fMLF , applied via micropipette ( Fig . 2a ) . Under these conditions , neu - trophils adopt a fan - like morphology with a broad leading edge directed toward the point source and a thin uropod trail - 2 | bioR ‰ iv Winer et al . | c a f b 60 sec 0 sec 0 sec 105 sec 60 sec 105 sec Δ G β 4 WT W T P h a go cy t i z i ng I g G M P s [ % ce ll s ] WT WTover P h a go cy t i z i ng I g G M P s [ % ce ll s ] CRISPRKOG β s 1 - 5 phagocytosisof IgG coatedMP WT Δ G β 4 1 2 3 4 0 200 400 600 Phagocytized MPs [ # ] C e ll s [ # ] WT d WT 0 50 100 150 C o m p l e t e d ph a go cy t o s i s [ % c on j ug a t es ] WT 0 200 400 600 800 1000 T i m e t o e ngu l f m e n t [ sec ] Phagocyte RAMOSB cell lymphoma CD47 CD20 SIRP α anti - CD47 anti - CD20 e g * * * * * * * * 0 2 4 6 8 10 P h a go cy t i z e d R a m o s ce ll s [ % ce ll s ] * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ΔGβ 4 ΔGβ 4 rescue ΔGβ 4 Δ G β 4 Δ G β 5 Δ G β 3 Δ G β 2 Δ G β 1 ΔGβ 4 ΔGβ 4 W T Δ G β 4 Δ G β 4 a n t i - C D 20 Δ G β 4 a n t i - C D 47 Δ G β 4 B o t h W T a n t i - C D 20 W T a n t i - C D 47 W T B o t h 0 20 40 60 80 100 P h a go cy t o s i s A . f u m i g a t u s [ % ce ll s ] W T 0 10 20 30 40 P h a go cy t o s i s b ac t e r i a [ % ce ll s ] 0 5 10 15 E ff r o cy t o s i s ce ll c o r p ses [ % ce ll s ] * * * * * * * * * * * W T W T Δ G β 4 Δ G β 4 Δ G β 4 Bacteria Fungalspores Apoptoticcells 0 5 10 15 20 0 2 4 6 8 Fig . 1 .

Both   G — 4 and WT cells were able to migrate up the fMLF gradient , but   G — 4 cells did so at a signiﬁ - cantly slower rate ( Fig . 2b , Supplementary Video 2 ) . This reduction in motility was associated with the formation of extended “tails” at the rear of migrating   G — 4 cells , sugges - tive of a defect in uropod retraction ( Fig . 2c ) . Indeed , we observed multiple instances in which extensively elongated   G — 4 cells appeared to be “struggling” against their own uropod to make forward progress ( Fig . 2c ) . Next , we in - terrogated crosstalk between phagocytosis and migration by quantifying the motility of HL - 60 cells after uptake of one IgG - coated MP . WT and   G — 4 neutrophils were fed MPs with distinct ﬂuorescent labels ( pHrodoRed ( WT ) versus pHrodoGreen (   G — 4 ) ) to facilitate imaging and tracking in mixed samples . Particle consumption slowed the movement of WT neutrophils considerably relative to unfed , WT con - trols ( Fig . 2b ) . The same could not be said for   G — 4 neu - trophils , which moved faster than their unfed   G — 4 coun - terparts ( Fig . 2b ) . Although the instantaneous speed of fed   G — 4 neutrophils remained slightly less than that of fed WT cells , their migration was more persistent , yielding signiﬁ - cantly longer tracks that more closely approached the fMLF point source ( Fig . 2d - e , Supplementary Video 2 ) . These motility phenotypes were mirrored by changes in cell shape . In WT neutrophils , phagocytosis appeared to hamper migra - tory polarization ; cells periodically collapsed into a rounded conﬁguration , and these morphological changes tended to co - incide with stalls in motility ( Fig . 2c , Supplementary Video 2 ) . By contrast ,   G — 4 morphology was normalized by par - ticle uptake ; fed cells formed persistent leading edges and lacked the extended uropods characteristic of the unfed state ( Fig . 2c ) . Hence ,   G — 4 depletion alters not only the speed of neutrophil migration but also the ability of phagocytosis to inhibit motility . G — 4 deﬁciency alters lipid composition and plasma mem - brane abundance The striking uropod extension displayed by migrating   G — 4 HL - 60 cells was suggestive of a substantial change in their cellular architecture . Consistent with this notion , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) indicated that   G — 4 HL - 60 cells had a more rufﬂed surface appearance than WT controls ( Fig . 3a ) . To investigate this structural difference more closely , Winer et al . | bioR ‰ iv | 3 we performed Focused Ion Beam ( FIB ) - SEM , a method in which successive sections from the same sample are imaged by SEM and then used to generate a nanometer - resolution 3 - D reconstruction ( Ritter et al . 2022 ) . WT and   G — 4 HL - 60 cells were osmium - stained to highlight lipid - rich cellu - lar components , embedded in resin , and subjected to FIB - SEM at 40 nm sectioning . Supervised machine learning was used to deﬁne the plasma membrane in each image , followed by 3 - D rendering ( Wang et al . 2023 ) . The resulting recon - structions revealed striking differences in plasma membrane conﬁguration . Whereas the surface of WT cells was mostly smooth with small extensions ,   G — 4 cells exhibited large ﬂaps of plasma membrane projecting up to 10 µm from the cell body ( Fig . 3b , Supplementary Video 3 ) . The presence of these structures increased the surface to volume ratio of   G — 4 HL - 60 cells by a factor of two relative to WT con - trols ( Fig . 3c ) .   G — 4 cells also contained larger and more numerous cytoplasmic lipid droplets , which appeared as high contrast compartments in osmium - stained FIB - SEM images ( Fig . 3b , 3d - e ) . This increase in lipid droplet load was con - ﬁrmed by BODIPY staining ( ﬁg . S4a - b ) . Hence , — 4 de - pletion increases plasma membrane abundance and promotes lipid droplet formation in HL - 60 cells . To better quantify the   G — 4 membrane accumulation phe - notype , we exposed WT and   G — 4 HL - 60 cells to osmotic shock , which swells cells to the limits of their plasma mem - brane capacity and thereby enables comparisons of total sur - face area .   G — 4 HL - 60 cells were only slightly larger than their WT counterparts under isotonic conditions . Upon trans - fer to hypotonic medium , however ,   G — 4 cells expanded to twice the size of controls ( Fig . 3f ) . Assuming that swelled HL - 60 cells are spherical , this volume differential implies a 60 percent increase in plasma membrane surface area . This excess plasma membrane would be expected to facilitate the formation of phagocytic cups and thereby promote engulf - ment . To quantify membrane mobilization during cup forma - tion , we utilized a “frustrated phagocytosis” assay ( Masters et al . 2013 ; Kovari et al . 2016 ) in which HL - 60 cells were applied to IgG - coated glass slides . Neutrophils and macrophages form ﬂat , unresolved phagocytic cups on sur - faces of this kind , which are easily visualized by total in - ternal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . Frustrated phagosomes formed by   G — 4 HL - 60 cells were substan - tially larger than those of WT controls ( ﬁg . S4c ) , consistent with a role for increased membrane abundance in phagocytic cup formation . Membrane tension is known to inhibit both phagocytosis and migration , presumably by mechanically constraining the for - mation of actin - based structures and / or activating inhibitory mechanosensory pathways ( Masters et al . 2013 ) . We spec - ulated that , by increasing plasma membrane abundance , — 4 deﬁciency might reduce membrane tension and thereby at - tenuate these regulatory effects . To explore this possibility , we utilized an established approach in which a concanavalin - A - coated bead is adsorbed to the cell surface and then pulled away using an optical trap ( Dai and Sheetz 1995 ) . The dis - placed bead remains attached to the cell via a thin membrane tether , which exerts a restoring force that is proportional to the square of membrane tension ( Bo and Waugh 1989 ; Hein - rich and Waugh 1996 ) . In this manner , we found that — 4 deﬁciency reduced tether forces by a factor of two ( Fig . 3g ) .   G — 4 cells also generated longer tethers then WT controls , indicating that they possessed larger plasma membrane reser - voirs ( Fig . 3h ) ( Raucher and Sheetz 1999 ) . Rescue exper - iments conﬁrmed that both phenotypes were speciﬁc to — 4 ( Fig . 3g - h ) . In conjunction with the imaging and osmotic shock studies described above , these results suggest a cen - tral role for plasma membrane abundance in the regulation of neutrophil effector responses . To explore potential mechanisms underlying the   G — 4 plasma membrane phenotype , we subjected   G — 4 and WT HL - 60 cells to comparative lipidomics ( Fig . 4a and ﬁg . S5a - b ) . As expected ,   G — 4 HL - 60 cells contained more to - tal lipids than WT controls on a per cell basis ( ﬁg . S5c ) . This increase did not apply to all lipid subtypes , however , as many species were unchanged between samples and some , like hexosylceramides , were more abundant in WT cells ( ﬁg . S5d ) .   G — 4 neutrophils were distinguished by dispropor - tionate enrichment of sphingolipids , particularly ceramide and sphingomyelin ( Fig . 4a and ﬁg . S5c ) , which are pre - dominantly found in the plasma membrane . Using RNA - sequencing , we documented selective upregulation of sphin - golipid synthesis genes in   G — 4 neutrophils after MP feed - ing ( Fig . 4b ) , establishing an additional link between sphin - golipids and the   G — 4 phenotype . To interrogate the role of sphingolipids in plasma membrane expansion more di - rectly , we asked whether inhibition of sphingolipid synthe - sis could reverse the effects of — 4 deﬁciency . To this end , we applied the small molecule myriocin , a potent inhibitor of serine palmitoyl transferase , the ﬁrst enzyme in the sph - ingolipid synthesis pathway ( Fig . 4c and ﬁg . S5e ) ( Glaros et al . 2007 ; Wadsworth et al . 2013 ) . Myriocin treatment during differentiation restored the membrane tension of   G — 4 HL - 60 cells to WT levels ( Fig . 4d ) , and it also largely reversed their hyperphagic behavior ( Fig . 4e ) . Notably , acute treat - ment of fully differentiated   G — 4 HL - 60 cells with myri - ocin had no effect on MP uptake ( ﬁg . S5f ) , implying that the functionally relevant effects of — 4 signaling on sphingolipid synthesis occur during the differentiation phase . Collectively , these results indicate that the excess plasma membrane char - acteristic of   G — 4 cells is due , at least in part , to increased sphingolipid synthesis . G — 4 controls membrane abundance and phagocytosis in primary myeloid cells Having demonstrated   G — 4 - induced hyperphagy in HL - 60 cells , we next investigated whether this mechanism oper - ates in primary neutrophils and macrophages . By apply - ing CRISPR - Cas9 targeting to the ER - HoxB8 immortalized murine neutrophil progenitor system ( Hopke et al . 2020 ; Greene et al . 2022 ; Khoyratty et al . 2021 ) ( ﬁg . S6a - b ) , we were able to generate primary neutrophils lacking — 4 , along with controls expressing non - targeting guide ( g ) RNA . Both   G — 4 and WT ER - HoxB8 neutrophils expressed equivalent levels of CD11b and Ly6G after differentiation ( ﬁg .

As with   G — 4 HL - 60 cells ,   G — 4 ER - HoxB8 neutrophils displayed clear signs of plasma mem - brane dysregulation , including reduced membrane tension and increased membrane tether length in optical trap ex - periments ( ﬁg . S6d - e ) .   G — 4 ER - HoxB8 neutrophils also expanded to nearly twice the volume of WT controls upon transfer to hypotonic medium ( ﬁg . S6f ) . In phagocytosis as - says , both WT and   G — 4 ER - HoxB8 neutrophils failed to consume IgG - coated MPs , likely because murine neutrophils are substantially smaller than HL - 60 cells and therefore un - able to accommodate larger ( 10 µm diameter ) cargos . When challenged with smaller ( 2 µm diameter ) S . aureus bioparti - cles , however ,   G — 4 ER - HoxB8 neutrophils more than dou - bled the consumption of WT controls ( ﬁg . S6g ) . To assess the role of — 4 signaling in primary macrophages , we prepared WT and   G — 4 macrophages from human in - duced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) ( Fig . 5a and ﬁg . S7a ) ( Zhang and Reilly 2017 ; Vaughan - Jackson et al . 2021 ; Alsinet et al . 2022 ) . CRISPR - Cas9 was used to target the GNB4 locus ( encoding — 4 ) at the hiPSC stage , and WT control hiPSCs were generated in parallel using a nontar - geting gRNA ( ﬁg . S7b ) . Granulocyte monocyte progenitor ( GMP ) cells derived from these hiPSC lines were then differ - entiated into mature CD11b + CD14 + CD68 + macrophages . Importantly , loss of — 4 did not affect the efﬁcacy of this differentiation protocol ( ﬁg . S8 ) . In optical trap experi - ments ,   G — 4 macrophages generated weaker tether forces and longer membrane tethers than WT controls , indicative of reduced membrane tension and larger membrane reser - voirs , respectively ( Fig . 5b - c ) .   G — 4 macrophages also became substantially larger than their WT counterparts in hypotonic medium , despite being similarly sized under iso - tonic conditions ( Fig . 5d ) . These data , which mirrored our results in the HL - 60 and ER - HoxB8 systems , strongly sug - gested that   G — 4 macrophages possess excess plasma mem - brane . Finally , we evaluated phagocytic capacity and found that — 4 deﬁciency markedly increased the uptake of IgG - coated MPs ( Fig . 5e ) . We conclude that the — 4 pathway regulates plasma membrane abundance and phagocytosis in primary neutrophils and macrophages . G — 4 regulates anti - fungal immunity in vivo Phagocytes are the ﬁrst line of defense against microbes in multiple epithelial tissues ( Witter , Okunnu , and Berg 2016 ; Johansson and Kirsebom 2021 ; Giese , Hind , and Hutten - locher 2019 ) . To evaluate the role of G b 4 - dependent mem - brane allocation during this early phase of immunity , we generated mice with a targeted deletion of exon 4 of the Winer et al . | bioR ‰ iv | 5 Δ G β 4 WT b a Δ G β 4 WT g c WT G 4 0 2 4 6 8 S u r f ace a r ea t o v o l u m e r a t i o WT G 4 0 50 100 150 I n t e r n a l ves i c l es [ # / p e r ce ll ] WT G 4 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 V o l u m e [ µ m 3 ] W T W T O s m o G 1 G 1 O s m o G 2 G 2 O s m o G 3 G 3 O s m o G 4 G 4 O s m o G 5 G 5 O s m o 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 V o l u m e [ u m 3 ] Osmoticshock * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * WT G 4 WT over G 4 rescue 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 T e t h e r Fo r ce [ p N ] * * * * * * * * * * * * d e h f [ µ m - 1 [ 0 10 20 30 40 T e t h e r L e ng t h [ u m ] WT G 4 WT over G 4 rescue * * * * * * * * * * * * Fig . 3 .

This modiﬁcation prematurely terminated the Gnb4 open reading frame , leading to con - stitutive G b 4 deﬁciency . Mice homozygous for this dele - tion ( Gnb4 - / - ) and WT ( Gnb4 + / + ) littermate controls were infected intratracheally with Aspergillus fumigatus , a fungal pathogen that elicits the robust recruitment of phagocytically active neutrophils to the lung ( Guo et al . 2020 ; Mircescu et al . 2009 ; Espinosa et al . 2022 ) . To enable ﬂow cytomet - ric detection of fungal uptake by these cells , we employed Fluorescent Aspergillus Reporter ( FLARE ) conidia that ex - pressed dsRed , a degradable ﬂuorescent protein , and were also labeled with Alexa Fluor ( AF ) 633 , a non - degradable small molecule dye . Cells that take up FLARE conidia turn AF633 + dsRed + , while cells that have killed the phagocytized fungi become AF633 + dsRed - ( Fig . 6a ) ( Jhingran et al . 2012 ) . A . fumigatus infection induced similar levels of neutrophil recruitment to the lungs of WT and Gnb4 - / - animals , with CD11b + Ly6G + SiglecF - cells accounting for 70 percent of CD45 + inﬁltrates , in both experimental groups ( Fig . 6b ) . Fungal phagocytosis was almost 3 times higher in Gnb4 - / - neutrophils ( Fig . 6c ) , however , mirroring the hyperphagic phenotype seen in HL - 60 cells , ER - HoxB8 neutrophils , and hiPSC derived macrophages lacking G b 4 . Among these phagocytic cells , the frequency of fungal killing was unaf - fected by G b 4 deﬁciency ( ﬁg . S9c ) , consistent with the inter - pretation that G b 4 signaling modulates cargo uptake and not subsequent acidiﬁcation of the phagolysosome . Gnb4 - / - ani - mals also exhibited a 10 fold reduction in fungal CFU in the lung relative to WT controls at the 18 hour time point ( Fig . 6d ) , indicating that the increased conidial phagocytosis con - ferred by loss of G b 4 improved fungal clearance during early stage infection . Given that G b 4 deﬁcient HL - 60 cells failed to arrest their motility after cargo uptake ( Fig . 2b - e ) , we speculated that Gnb4 - / - phagocytes might exhibit altered trafﬁcking behav - ior in vivo . Accordingly , we examined the organ distribu - tion of phagocytic WT and Gnb4 - / - neutrophils 24 hours af - ter FLARE infection ( Fig . 6a ) . In WT mice , neutrophils bearing AF633 - labeled material were found predominantly in the lungs , with trace amounts in the draining lymph nodes ( dLNs ) and essentially none in the spleen and blood ( Fig . 6e - g , ﬁg . S9d ) . These observations were consistent with the expectation that phagocytosis inhibits motility after conidial uptake in the lungs , thereby preventing the dissemination of neutrophils with internalized pathogens to other organs . By contrast , we observed a substantial number of AF633 + neu - trophils in the dLNs of Gnb4 - / - animals ( Fig . 6e - f ) , suggest - ing that G b 4 deﬁciency at least partially relieves the brake on motility applied by phagocytosis . Importantly , whereas es - sentially all AF633 + neutrophils in WT dLNs were DsRed - , indicating that they had degraded their internalized conidia , a substantial fraction of DsRed + AF633 + neutrophils were observed in Gnb4 - / - dLNs ( Fig . 6h ) . Given that G b 4 deﬁ - ciency does not affect phagolysosome maturation ( Fig . 1 ) , these results strongly suggest that Gnb4 - / - neutrophils con - tinue to migrate after conidial uptake , enabling them to reach proximal organs like the dLN before their cargo is broken down . We conclude that G b 4 deﬁciency not only increases the phagocytic capacity of myeloid cells in vivo but also dis - rupts the cross - regulatory relationship between phagocytosis and migration . Discussion Taken together , our results identify G b 4 as a critical regu - lator of plasma membrane abundance in myeloid cells and demonstrate that the plasma membrane exerts biophysical control over phagocytic capacity and functional crosstalk .

This scarcity model is consis - tent with prior work documenting antagonism between up - take behaviors , such as phagocytosis and micropinocytosis , and migration ( Bretou et al . 2017 ; Chabaud et al . 2015 ; Luo et al . 2009 ) . Thus , the mechanisms governing plasma membrane allocation in myeloid cells effectively dictate their functional potential . Notably , the plasma membrane depen - dent control mechanism studied here appears to affect most strongly the phagocytosis of large ( 10 um diameter ) cargos , such as apoptotic cells and cancer cells , while having less impact on the uptake of small entities like bacteria . This dis - tinction likely reﬂects the fact that engulﬁng large , unbroken targets with high surface area places a disproportionate bur - den on plasma membrane mobilization . The importance of G b 4 for regulating this type of phagocytosis suggests that it may be particularly relevant for processes that involve the clearance of large eukaryotic cells , such as tissue homeosta - sis and anti - tumor immunosurveillance . The dramatic func - tional gains exhibited by G b 4 neutrophils and macrophages raise the question of why G b 4 dependent control of mem - brane abundance evolved in the ﬁrst place . One obvious an - swer is that tight cross - inhibition between phagocytosis and migration is essential for immune function , at least in some contexts . Indeed , we found that Gnb4 - / - neutrophils not only take up more A . fumigatus conidia in vivo but also trafﬁc them out of the lung to the dLN . While increased fungal dispersion did not appear to compromise immunity in these experiments , one could imagine that a pathogen more ca - pable of resisting or escaping the phagolysosome could ex - ploit the dysregulated migration of G b 4 deﬁcient phagocytes Winer et al . | bioR ‰ iv | 7 a Viability FluorophoreTracerFluorophore BystanderLeukocyte Leukocyte + live A . f .

Although we cannot at present rule out a role for G b 4 in the acute regulation of phagocytosis and motil - ity , we favor a model in which the G b 4 pathway acts during myeloid cell differentiation to dictate the size and composi - tion of the plasma membrane , which then serves as a mas - ter mechanoregulator of morphology and effector responses in the terminally differentiated state ( ﬁg . S10 ) . This model is consistent with our observations that G b 4 neutrophils and macrophages exhibit architectural abnormalities ( Fig . 3 and ﬁg . S4 ) and also that acute myriocin treatment fails to reverse the G b 4 phagocytosis phenotype ( ﬁg . S5f ) . We postulate that differential G b 4 expression among myeloid progenitors might promote functional diversiﬁcation by enabling the for - mation of differentiated subsets with a spectrum of plasma membrane - deﬁned phagocytic and migratory setpoints . This type of diversity could enable the innate immune system to engage effectively with a wide variety of homeostatic and microbial challenges . G b 4 mutations have been associated with Charcot - Marie - Tooth disease ( CMTD ) ( Lassuthova et al . 2017 ; Soong et al . 2013 ; Hsu et al . 2019 ; Kwon et al . 2021 ) , a hereditary neurological disorder characterized by the progressive demyelination of peripheral nerves . Although the pathogenesis of this disease is generally thought to arise from cell - intrinsic glial dysfunction , macrophages routinely patrol peripheral nerves and are well - positioned to induce au - toimmune neuropathy ( Zigmond and Echevarria 2019 ; Kolter , Kierdorf , and Henneke 2020 ) . Interestingly , macrophage de - pletion has been shown to attenuate neurodegeneration in mouse CMTD models ( Klein , Patzko , et al . 2015 ; Klein , Groh , et al . 2015 ; Carenini et al . 2001 ) . In light of these reports , our data raise the intriguing possibility that dysreg - ulated macrophage phagocytosis might contribute to at least some forms of CMTD . The identiﬁcation of G b 4 signaling and sphingolipid synthesis as key regulators of phagocytic 8 | bioR ‰ iv Winer et al . | capacity in myeloid cells reveals heretofore unexplored av - enues for enhancing innate immunity in therapeutic contexts . By targeting the architectural basis of cargo uptake , one could potentially modulate phagocyte activity in a manner that is agnostic to speciﬁc targets . We anticipate that an approach like this would be particularly useful for treating systemic microbial infections and for enhancing the anti - tumor poten - tial of chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) - macrophages ( Sloas , Gill , and Klichinsky 2021 ; Alvey and Discher 2017 ) . Explor - ing these possibilities in additional translational experimental systems will be an interesting topic for future research .

Jurkat human T cell lymphoblasts ( clone E6 - 1 ) were purchased from ATCC ( cat TIB - 152 ) . RAMOS B cell Burkitt’s Lymphoma cells were purchased from ATTC ( cat CRL - 1596 ) . HL - 60 , Jurkat , and RAMOS cells were grown in RPMI media supplemented with L - glutamine , 25 mM Hepes , 10 percent ( vol / vol ) heat inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , at 1 percent Pen / Strep . HL - 60 progenitor cells were split to 2 × 105 cells / mL every 2 days and grown at 37 ºC , 5 percent CO2 . HL - 60 progenitors were differentiated into neutrophil - like cells by transfer into 1 . 5 percent ( vol / vol ) DMSO at 2 × 105 cells / mL followed by 5 days of incubation at 37 ºC , 5 percent CO2 . HEK293T lentiX cells ( Takara Bio , cat 632180 ) were grown in DMEM containing 10 percent ( vol / vol ) heat - inactivated FBS and 1 percent Pen / Step and maintained at 37 ºC , 5 percent CO2 . All cell lines were routinely checked for mycoplasma contamination . HL - 60 manipulation G b 1 - 5 were deleted from HL - 60 progenitors using the IDT Alt - R CRISPR - Cas9 system ( IDT ) . Brieﬂy , crRNAs speciﬁc for G b 1 - 5 ( see table 1 below for sequence details ) were resuspended in sterile Duplex Buffer ( IDT ) to a ﬁnal concentration of 200 µM . Each crRNA was then mixed with tracrRNA - ATTO 550 ( IDT ) at a 1 : 1 ratio and annealed using a thermocycler ( BioRad ) . sgRNA : Cas9 RNP’s were formed by mixing 0 . 3 µL of 36 µM Cas9 protein ( IDT ) with annealed sgRNAs at a 1 : 1 ratio followed by room temperature incubation for 10 - 20 minutes .

The homology arms were 5’ - ctaccggactcagatctcga - 3’ at the N - terminus of GNB4 and 5’ - tcgagctcatcgggatcccgctcgacta - 3’ at the C - terminus . The resulting plasmid was combined with plasmids encoding ( 1 ) a minimal HIV pLVX with GNB4 - 2A - Puro transgene , ( 2 ) gag - pol from HIV53 and ( 3 ) appropriate viral glycoproteins ( VSV - G ) , and the mixture then transfected into HEK293T lentiX cells ( Takara Bio ) using the Xtremegene transfection reagent ( Roche Applied Science ) . Lentivirus was collected 24 and 48 hours post transfection and stored at - 80 ºC until use . For transduction , 0 . 5 to 1 × 106 HL - 60 progenitor cells were mixed with lentivirus preparations ( 1 mL of virus supplemented with polybrene and HEPES ) and centrifuged at 1400 × g at 37 ºC for 2 hours in either 24 - well or 6 - well polystyrene plates ( Corning ) . Subsequently , 1 mL of RPMI complete media ( 10 percent FBS , 1 percent Pen / Strep ) was added to the cells , followed by overnight incubation at 37 ºC , 5 percent CO2 . Cells were then placed in 0 . 5 µg / mL puromycin for 14 days to select for successfully transduced cells . HL - 60 progenitors transduced with lentivirus derived from empty pLVX - Puro were prepared in parallel as controls . To express F - tractin - mCherry in HL - 60 cells , DNA encoding the F - tractin - mCherry fusion was ampliﬁed from a C1 - F - tractin - mCherry plasmid ( Addgene , 155218 ) and then subcloned into the lentiviral vector pLVX - M - Puro ( CloneTech ) by Gibson reaction . Lentivirus production and transduction was performed as described above . Fungal / bacterial lines FLARE Aspergillus fumigatus conidia were prepared as previously described ( Jhingran et al . 2012 ) . Brieﬂy , Af293 conidia were transformed with pAN7 - 1 ( Punt et al . 1987 ) and pPgpd - dsRed ( Mikkelsen et al . 2003 ) , and 5 × 108 of the resulting Af293 - dsRed conidia were incubated with 0 . 5 mg / mL Biotin XX , SSE ( B - 6352 ; Invitrogen ) in 1 mL of 50 mM carbonate buffer ( pH 8 . 3 ) for 2 h at 4 ºC , washed once with 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl ( pH 8 ) , and then labeled using 0 . 02 mg / mL AF633 - streptavidin ( S - 21375 ; Invitrogen ) in 1 mL PBS for 30 min at room temperature . Double - labeled FLARE conidia were resuspended in PBS + 0 . 025 percent Tween 20 for experimental use . Pseudomonas aeruginosa expressing GFP ( P . aeruginosa PA14 PrhlAB : : gfp , kind gift from Joao Xavier ) were labeled with AF633 by ﬁrst incubating 5 × 107 bacterial cells with 0 . 5 mg / mL Biotin XX , SSE ( B - 6352 ; Invitrogen ) in 1 ml 50 mM carbonate buffer ( pH 8 . 3 ) for 2 h at 4 ºC . After washing with 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl ( pH 8 ) , cells were labeled using 0 . 02 mg / mL AF633 - streptavidin ( S - 21375 ; Invitrogen ) in 1 mL PBS for 30 min at RT , followed by resuspension in PBS + 0 . 025 percent Tween 20 . Polyacrylamide microparticle ( MP ) cargo 10 µm diameter polyacrylamide MPs were synthesized as previously described ( Vorselen et al . 2020 ) , with modiﬁcations . Aqueous acrylamide solutions were prepared containing 150 mM MOPS ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 0 . 3 percent ( v / v ) tetramethylethylenediamene ( TEMED ) , 150 mM NaOH , and 10 percent ( v / v ) acrylic acid . The mass fraction of total acrylamide was kept constant at 10 percent and the cross - linker mass fraction was 2 . 4 percent . This mixture was sparged with nitrogen gas for 15 minutes and then kept under nitrogen pressure . Hydrophobic Shirasu porous glass ( SPG ) ﬁlters ( 1 . 9 µm pore size ) were sonicated under vacuum in n - dodecane , mounted on an internal pressure micro kit extruder ( SPG Technology Co ) , and submerged into the organic phase , consisting of 99 percent hexanes and 1 percent ( v / v ) Span - 80 ( Sigma - Aldrich , S6760 ) , with continuous stirring at 300 rpm . 10 mL of the acrylamide mixture was then loaded into the apparatus and extruded under nitrogen pressure into 250 mL of the hexane mixture . To initiate polymerization , the resulting emulsion was heated to 60 ºC and 2 , 2’ - azobisisobutyronitrile ( 2 mg / mL , 500 mg total ) was added . The reaction was kept at 60 ºC for 3 hours and then at 40 ºC overnight . Polymerized MPs were harvested by washing 3 times in hexanes and 2 times in ethanol ( 30 minutes , 4000 rpm ) , followed by resuspension in PBS . For functionalization , MPs were washed twice in activation buffer ( 100 mM MES , 20 mM NaCl , pH 6 . 0 ) and then incubated for 15 minutes with 40 mg / mL 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide ( EDC ) , 20 mg / mL N - hydroxysuccinimide ( NHS ) in activation buffer with 0 . 1 percent ( v / v ) Tween 20 , vortexing brieﬂy every 5 min . After 3 washes in PBST8 ( PBS with 0 . 1 percent ( v / v ) Tween 20 , adjusted to pH 8 ) , MPs were Winer et al . | bioR ‰ iv | 23 resuspended in PBST8 and a protein / dye solution was added . For streptavidin labeling , 250 pmol streptavidin per million MPs was added . For acidiﬁcation assays , MPs were conjugated with either 5 - FITC - ethylenediamine ( 5 µM ﬁnal , AAT Bioquest 126 ) and LissamineTM Rhodamine B Ethylene Diamene ( 5 µM ﬁnal , Invitrogen L2424 ) . After 2 h , unreacted NHS groups were blocked with ethanolamine ( 100 mM ﬁnal , in 100 mM Tris HCl ) . Finally , MPs were washed 3 times in PBST , pH 7 . 4 , and 3 times in PBS , pH 7 . 4 . In certain phagocytosis experiments , labeled MPs were conjugated with pHrodo Dyes rather than FITC / LRB by ﬁrst washing 3 times in 0 . 1M NaHCO3 , pH 8 . 4 , followed by a 1 h incubation in pHrodoTM Green STP Ester ( Invitrogen P35369 ) or pHrodoTM iFL Red STP Ester ( Invitrogen P36010 ) at 60 µM ﬁnal concentration , followed by 3 washes in PBS , pH 7 . 4 . Streptavidin conjugated MPs were loaded with Biotin - SP ChromPure Human IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch 015 - 060 - 003 ) , Biotin - SP ChromPure Human Serum IgA ( Jackson ImmunoResearch 009 - 060 - 011 ) , iC3B ( Quidel A423 ) , and Biotin - Phosphatidylserine ( Echelon L - 31B16 ) at 200 pmol per million MPs , 100 pmol per million MPs , 100 pmol per million MPs , and 50 pmol per million MPs , respectively , in 750 µL of PBS . iC3B was biotinylated prior to MP coating using the EZ - Link™ Sulfo - NHS - LC - Biotinylation Kit ( ThermoFisher ) . Flow cytometric MP phagocytosis assay Neutrophils stained with either Hoechst or CellVue Maroon ( both from ThermoFisher ) were seeded into ﬁbronectin - coated 24 well plates at a density of 150 , 000 cells per well . FITC / LRB labeled MPs coated with a phagocytic target ligand ( e . g . IgG ) were then added at a 1 : 2 ( MP : cell ) ratio , followed by incubation at 37 ºC , 5 percent CO2 for 3 hours . Cells were then removed by trypsinization and transferred into FACS tubes for analysis using a Cytoﬂex LX machine ( Beckman ) . Analysis was performed by ﬁrst gating out free ﬂoating MPs and then identifying LRB + FITClow cells , indicative of successful uptake and acidiﬁcation of MPs . In each sample , the total number of LRB + FITClow cells was normalized to the total number of live cells to generate a percent phagocytosis metric . In experiments using pHrodoGreen or pHrodoRed dyed MPs , the percent phagocytosis metric was calculated using pHrodoBright cells ( in FITC or PE channels ) as the numerator and total cells as the denominator . In experiments comparing G b 4 and wild type HL - 60 cells in the same sample , each cell type was labeled with a different dye ( either Hoechst or CellVue Maroon , both from ThermoFisher ) to distinguish them during endpoint ﬂow cytometric analysis . Dyes were switched between experiments to control for potential effects of the dyes on phagocytosis . Wideﬁeld imaging of MP phagocytosis Neutrophils or macrophages were stained using Hoechst and / or CellVue Maroon ( both from ThermoFisher ) and seeded into ﬁbronectin coated 8 - well chamber slides ( ibidi ) at a density of 100 , 000 or 50 , 000 cells per well , respectively . FITC / LRB labeled IgG coated MPs were then added at a 1 : 2 ( MP : cell ) ratio , and the samples imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope using a 20 × objective lens for at least 2 h at 1 min intervals . DAPI , FITC , and TRITC images were collected at each time point . Phagocytosed MPs were identiﬁed in Fiji by a reduction in FITC signal due to phagolysosome acidiﬁcation . Percent phagocytosis was determined by dividing the number of phagocytes containing acidiﬁed MPs by the total number of phagocytes in each frame . High resolution imaging of phagocytic cup closure D G b 4 and WT HL - 60 cells expressing F - tractin - mCherry were stained with CellVue Maroon ( ThermoFisher ) using the manufacturer’s guidelines and then seeded at 100 , 000 cells per well into ﬁbronectin coated 8 - well ibidi chambers . IgG - coated , FITC - labeled MPs were either added at a 1 : 2 ( MP : cell ) ratio after cell seeding or , in some experiments , were attached to the bottom of the slide by ﬁrst coating with biotin poly - L - lysine ( ThermoFisher ) and then adding MPs for attachment . Cells were imaged using a SoRa spinning disk confocal microscope ( Nikon ) , a Stellaris spinning disk confocal microscope ( Leica ) , or an LSM880 confocal microscope ( Zeiss ) ﬁtted with 60 × objective lenses . In general , time - lapse experiments encompassed 30 minutes total with FITC , TRITC , and Cy5 images collected every 15 seconds . Images were analyzed using Fiji and / or Imaris to assess phagocytic cup progression and completion . Cup initiation was determined by an enrichment of F - tractin adjacent to the MP . Phagocytic cup closure was deﬁned as total MP encirclement by F - tractin / plasma membrane . Time to MP engulfment was determined by subtracting the time of cup closure from the time of initiation . Phagocytic cups that were not completed by the end of the 30 min time - lapse were considered “aborted” . Staphylococcus aureus bioparticle phagocytosis assay HL - 60 cells or primary neutrophils were seeded in ﬁbronectin coated 24 - well plates at 250 , 000 cells per well . 10 µL of S . aureus pHrodoRed bioparticles ( ThermoFisher ) , resuspended in sterile PBS at a ﬁnal concentration of 2 mg / mL , were then added to each well , followed by incubation at 37 ºC , 5 percent CO2 , for 1 hour . Cells were then harvested and transferred into FACS tubes for analysis using a Cytoﬂex LX machine ( Beckman ) . Percent phagocytosis was determined by dividing the total number of pHrodoRed + cells by the total number of cells in each sample . Jurkat efferocytosis assay 5 × 106 Jurkat cells in 10 mL complete RPMI ( 10 percent FBS , 1 percent Pen / Strep ) were transferred into a lidless 10 cm dish and subjected to 1500 microJ UV using a UV stratalinker ( Marshall Scientiﬁc ) , followed by a 4 h incubation at 37 ºC , 5 percent CO2 . The cell corpses were then resuspended in 10 mL of room temperature Hank’s buffered salt solution ( HBSS ) , stained with either CypHer5E NHS Ester ( 1 : 4000 in 4 mL PBS , Cytiva ) or pHrodoRed ( 1 : 5000 , Invitrogen ) for 10 min at 37 ºC , and then washed into complete RPMI ( 10 percent FBS , 1 percent Pen / Strep ) . Terminally differentiated HL - 60 cells were stained with CFSE ( 1 : 1000 , ThermoFisher ) and then mixed with Jurkat corpses at a ratio of ( 1 : 2 Jurkat cell corpse / HL - 60 cell ) in a ﬁnal volume of 1 mL , followed by incubation for 3 h at 37 ºC , 5Percent CO2 . The cells were then harvested and transferred into FACS tubes for analysis using a Cytoﬂex LX machine ( Beckman ) . Percent phagocytosis was determined by dividing the total number of FITC + Cypher + or FITC + pHrodoRed + HL - 60 cells by the total number of HL - 60 cells ( FITC + ) in each sample . Aspergillus fumigatus FLARE fungal phagocytosis and killing assay 24 | bioR ‰ iv Winer et al . | HL - 60 cells were seeded at 150 , 000 cells per well in a 24 well plate and then mixed with FLARE A . fumigatus ( see procedure above for preparation ) at a 2 : 1 ( fungi : cell ) ratio , followed by incubation at 37 ºC , 5 percent CO2 for 1 hour . Cells were then analyzed using a Cytoﬂex LX ﬂow cytometer ( Beckman ) . Percent phagocytosis was determined by dividing the total number of AF633 + HL - 60 cells by the total number of HL - 60 cells in each sample . Immunoblot Analysis For each sample , 106 cells were lysed using cold buffer containing 50 mM Tris - HCl , 0 . 15 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 percent NP - 40 , and 0 . 25 percent sodium deoxycholate . G b 4 expression was assessed using monoclonal antibodies against the human ortholog ( Abcam , ab223113 ) , with GAPDH ( clone D16H11 , Cell Signaling Technology ) serving as the loading control . IRDye 800 anti - mouse and IRDye 680 anti - rabbit secondary antibodies were used for visualization on Li - Cor Odyssey LX machine . Micropipette migration assay Differentiated D G b 4 and WT HL - 60 cells were stained with Hoescht ( MilliporeSigma ) for 20 min at 25 ºC and allowed to attach to ﬁbronectin - coated 35 mm glass - bottom cover slips for 1 h ( 250 , 000 cells per dish ) . Samples were washed to remove nonadherent cells and left in 3 mL of complete RPMI media prior to imaging . A femptotip ( Eppendorf ) micropipette loaded with sterile ﬁltered RPMI con - taining 2 percent fatty acid free BSA , 1 percent Pen / Strep , 200 nM fMLF , and trace AF647 dye was attached to a FemptoJet 4i ( Eppendorf ) , and the micropipette tip positioned and the center of the imaging frame . Pressure ( 400 psi ) was then applied to dispense the chemoattractant mixture and serial images ( 40 s intervals between frames ) collected over the course of an hour at 20 × magniﬁcation using a Ti Eclipse micro - scope with a CSU - 0W1 Yokogawa camera ( Nikon ) at 37 ºC , 5 percent CO2 . To measure migration after MP uptake , D G b 4 and WT HL - 60 cells were preincubated with pHrodoGreen or pHrodoRed labeled MPs , respectively , for 3 hours . Cells that had taken up MPs during this time were FACS sorted based on green ( D G b 4 ) or red ( WT ) ﬂuorescence . A 1 : 1 mixture of these cells was then applied to ﬁbronectin coated cover slips ( 250 , 000 cells per dish ) and chemotaxis toward a point source of fMLF measured as described above . Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) HL - 60 cells adhered to ﬁbronectin coated 1 . 5 coverslips ( Fisher Scientiﬁc ) were prepared for SEM with critical point drying . Brieﬂy , samples were dehydrated with ethanol gradient drying in ﬁve increments from 50 percent ethanol to 100 percent ethanol , for 10 minutes at each step . They were then subjected to critical point drying in a Bal - Tec CPD 030 device ( Bal - Tec , USA ) according to manufacturer instructions . Dried samples were sputter - coated using a Cressington 108 Auto Sputter Coater with a 5 - 10 nm thick layer of gold - palladium ( Cressington Scientiﬁc Instruments , UK ) and imaged using a Zeiss Sigma VP scanning electron microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) at 3 kV accelerating voltage , 5 mm working distance in In - Lens mode . FIB - SEM imaging and analysis Cells were plated on Aclar coverslips coated with ﬁbronectin and then ﬁxed with 2 percent glutaraldehyde , 2 mM CaCl2 in 0 . 08 M sodium cacodylate buffer , pH 7 . 2 . This primary ﬁxation was followed by a ROTO protocol ( Reduced Osmium - Thiocarbohydrazide - Osmium ) as follows : cells were incubated for one hour in 1 percent OsO4 , 1 . 25 percent potassium ferrocyanide in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer on ice , washed with buffer , and then incubated with 1 percent thiocarbohydrazide in water for 12 minutes . After washing , cells were treated with 1 percent Osmium tetroxide in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer for 30 min on ice . The samples were then dehydrated using a graded series of ethanol solutions and embedded in Eponate 12 . Sample blocks were trimmed and then mounted on an SEM sample holder using double - sided carbon tape ( EMS ) . Colloidal silver paint ( EMS ) was used to electrically ground the sides of the resin block . The entire surface of the specimen was then sputter coated with a thin layer ( 5 nm ) of gold / palladium . The sample was imaged using immersion , TLD , back - scattered electron ( BSE ) mode on an FEI Helios Nanolab 650 microscope . Images were recorded after each round of ion beam milling using the SEM beam at 2 . 0 keV and 0 . 10 nA current with a working distance of < 5 mm . Ion beam was held at 30 keV , with a milling current of 80 pA . Data acquisition occurred through automation using Auto Slice and View G3 software . Raw images were 4 , 096 × 2 , 048 pixels , with 20 - 50 nm slices viewed at a - 38° cross - sectional angle . Each raw image had a horizontal ﬁeld width ( HFW ) of 10 - 15 µm with an XY pixel size of 2 - 4 nm and 40 nm Z - step size . Images were aligned using the image processing programs in IMOD . All segmentation was performed using semi - manual thresholding and manual annotation of a test set ( 10 percent of data ) using the LabKit machine learning plug - in for Imaris . 3 - D renderings , reconstructions , surface / volume calculations , and internal vesicle volume calculations were performed using Imaris . Myriocin sphingolipid synthesis inhibition assays For acute myriocin treatment , HL - 60 cells on the 5th day of DMSO differentiation were treated with a ﬁnal concentration of 50 nM myriocin ( Millipore Sigma Aldrich ) for 12 h prior to phagocytosis or C - trap experiments . For long term inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis , HL - 60 progenitor cells were incubated over the 5 day DMSO differentiation in the presence of 50 nM myriocin . Treated cells were then used in phagocytosis or C - trap experiments . No observable effect on viability was observed in either treatment regime . Osmotic shock experiments HL - 60 cells or terminally differentiated primary human macrophages ( derived from hiPSC cells ) were suspended in 200 µL complete RPMI ( 10 percent FBS , 1 . 5 percent DMSO , 1 percent Pen / Strep ) or RPMI 1650 ( h - mCSF , 10 percent FBS , 1 percent Pen / Strep ) , respectively , and then applied to a Vi Cell Blue ( Beckman Coulter , MA ) cell counter to measure cell diameter . The samples were then osmotically shocked for 2 min or 4 min respectively by adding 180 µL of sterile ddH2O to 20 µL of suspended cells ( ﬁnal concentration of 2 × 105 cells per mL ) before loading onto the same device . Each measurement was performed using 9 biological replicates . All recorded samples had > 90 percent viability during the assay , as monitored by trypan blue ( ThermoFisher ) exclusion . Winer et al . | bioR ‰ iv | 25 Total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) imaging of frustrated phagocytosis The inner 4 chambers of an 8 well chamber slide ( Ibidi ) were coated with biotinylated poly - L lysine , followed by streptavidin and biotinylated human IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch 015 - 060 - 003 ) using an established protocol ( Quann et al . 2009 ) . Coated chamber slides were mounted on an Elyra 7 microscope ( Zeiss ) equipped with a 60 × TIRF objective lens , followed by addition of D G b 4 or wild type HL - 60 cells expressing F - tractin - mCherry and stained with CFSE ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) . Samples were imaged in TIRF mode for 10 min using 15 s intervals at 37 ºC , 5 Generation of mutant hiPSC lines The 731 . 2B - iPSC line was generated from human ﬁbroblasts ( GM00731 ) purchased from the Coriell Institute ( Miller et al . 2013 ) . These cells have been stocked and characterized by the Stem Cell Research Facility at MSKCC . They are my - coplasma free , express the expected levels of OCT4 , SOX2 , and NANOG , and have a normal karyotype . GNB4 - / - iPSCs were generated by CRISPR - Cas9 targeting . An sgRNA ( TGCGAACAAGACGTACACTG ) speciﬁc for GNB4 was ﬁrst subcloned into the pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - Puro ( PX459 ) V2 . 0 vector ( Addgene plasmid 62988 ) . 731 . 2B - iPSC cells were then dissociated using Accutase ( Innovative Cell Technologies ) and electroporated with the sgRNA - Cas9 plasmid using an Amaxa 4D - Nucleofector ( Lonza ) , following manufacturer’s instructions . Elec - troporated cells were cultured in 1 mL Essential 8 media ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) and Stemﬂex media ( Stem cell technologies ) at 37 ºC , 5 percent CO2 , for 4 days and then dissociated and subcloned . Approximately 10 days later , individual colonies derived from single cells were picked , mechanically disaggregated and replated into two individual wells of a 96 - well plate . Colonies were screened by PCR for biallelic frameshift mutations at the targeting site . Wild type clonal lines from the same targeting experiments were included as controls . hiPSC embryoid body formation and human primary macrophage differentiation Macrophages were differentiated from hiPSCs using an established protocol ( Lachmann et al . 2015 ) , with modiﬁcations . Brieﬂy , hiPSCs were seeded on CF1 mouse embryonic feeders and maintained for 3 days in ESC medium ( KO - DMEM ( 10829 - 018 ) , 20 percent KO - Serum ( 10828 - 028 ) , 2mM L - glutamine ( 25030 - 024 ) , 1 percent Nonessential Amino Acids ( 11140 - 035 ) , 0 . 2 percent beta - mercaptoethanol ( 31350 - 010 ) , 1 percent Pen / Strep ( 15140163 ) ( all supplied by ThermoFisher ) with 10 ng / mL bFGF ( Peprotech 100 - 18B ) and subsequently for 4 days in ESC media without bFGF . 7 days after seeding , at day ( D ) 0 of the differentiation process , hiPSC colonies were detached in clusters using a 13 minute incubation with collagenase type IV ( 250 IU / mL ﬁnal concentration ) ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ; 17104019 ) and transferred to 6 well low adhesion plates in ESC media supplemented with 10 µM ROCK Inhibitor ( Sigma ; Y0503 ) to initiate the differentiation process . The plates were kept on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm for 6 days to allow for spontaneous formation of embryoid bodies ( EB ) with hematopoietic potential . At D6 of the differentiation process , well - formed 200 - 500 µm EBs were picked under a dissecting microscope and transferred onto adherent tissue culture plates ( 2 . 5 EBs / cm2 ) for cultivation in Hematopoietic Differentiation ( HD ) medium ( APEL2 ( Stem Cell Tech 05270 ) , Protein free hybridoma medium ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ; 12040077 ) , 1 percent pen / strep , 25 ng / mL hIL - 3 ( Peprotech ; 200 - 03 ) , and 50 ng / mL hM - CSF ( Peprotech , 300 - 25 ) ) . Starting from D18 of the differentiation and then every week onwards for up to two months , macrophages produced by EBs were carefully collected from suspension , ﬁltered through a 100 µm mesh , plated at a density of 10 , 000 cells / cm2 , and cultivated for 6 days in RPMI1640 / GlutaMax ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ; 61870036 ) medium supplemented with 10 percent FBS ( EMD Millipore TMS - 013 - B ) , and 100 ng / mL human M - CSF before use in downstream experiments . All cells were cultured at 37 ºC , 5 Membrane tension measurements Plasma membrane tension was quantiﬁed using a C - Trap optical trapping device ( Lumicks BV , Nether - lands ) . An IR laser beam ( 50 mW , 1064 nm ) was tightly focused through a series of mirrors , beam expanders and a high numerical aperture objective lens ( 63 × / 1 . 2 NA , Nikon Instruments ) to form a steerable optical trap . Cells were immobilized inside an Ibidi µ - slide ( Ibidi GmbH , Germany ) treated with 200 µg / mL ﬁbronectin ( Thermo / Sigma ) . To measure plasma membrane tension , polystyrene beads ( 2 . 2 µm , Spherotech Inc , IL ) were coated with concanavalin A ( 50 µg / mL , Thermo / Sigma ) and added to the cell culture medium inside the slide . Beads were momentarily placed in contact with the cell membrane , and tethers were then extruded by moving the bead away from the cell perpendicularly at a speed of 2 µm / s . Force measurements were made using the Lumicks Bluelake software suite by capturing the exiting trapping light with a high numerical aperture condenser lens ( 63 × / 1 . 45 , oil immersion , Zeiss AB , Germany ) and measuring bead displacement in the trap with position - sensitive detectors through back focal plane interferometry . Membrane tether breaking was documented as a sharp discontinuity in tether force during tether extrusion , with breaking distance measured from simultaneously collected brightﬁeld images using FIJI .

In brief , samples were resuspended in 300 µL of methanol containing SPLASH LIPIDOMIX ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) as internal standards , vortexed , and then mixed with 600 µL of chloroform . 180 µL of water was added to each tube to induce phase separation , and after mixing , samples were centrifuged at 16 , 000 × g for 5 min at 4 ºC . Subsequently , the lower , chloroform layer was collected and the aqueous layer re - extracted using 450 µL of chloroform : methanol : water ( 3 : 48 : 47 v / v / v ) . The lower , chloroform layer was collected and pooled with the previous extract . Sam - ples were then dried under nitrogen at 40 ºC and resuspended in 100 µL of 90 : 10 methanol : chloroform . Lipid proﬁling was performed using an Agilent 6546 Q - TOF mass spectrometer in positive and negative ionization modes , coupled to a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C - 18 Column ( 100 mm × 2 . 1 , 1 . 8 µm particle size , Agilent ) .

To identify lipid species , iterative MS / MS acquisition data in positive and negative polarity was processed using Agilent Lipid Annotator software 1 . 0 ( Koelmel et al . 2020 ) . Subsequent targeted feature extraction and peak integration was performed using Skyline ( Adams et al . 2020 ) . For statistical analysis , the Welch T - test was used for pairwise comparisons between wild type and G b 4 groups with Benjamini - Hochberg FDR correction . Generation of Gnb4 - / - mice The animal protocols used for this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of MSKCC . Two sgRNA sequences ( 5’ - cgtcaaaatatcgcaagtgc - 3’ ) and ( 5’ - aggtgtcagatcaaacc - 3’ ) targeting exon 4 of the Gnb4 locus ( IDT ) were injected together with puriﬁed Cas9 protein ( IDT ) into C57BL / 6 zygotes , which were then transferred into C57BL / 6 pseudopregnant females . Founder animals were screened for deletion of the entire exon 4 and the presence of an early stop codon in exon 5 , and then bred to homozygosity . Routine genotyping PCRs were performed using the following forward ( 5’ - ggagaacagctagtactcttaac - 3’ ) and reverse ( 5’ - aaaagtatttattagcagtatc - 3’ ) primers . The resulting amplicons for WT and Gnb4 KO mutant alleles are 1360 bp and 305 bp respectively . A . fumigatus FLARE intratracheal mouse fungal infections Gnb4 - / - and WT mice were infected by intratracheal ( i . t . ) administration of 60 × 106 FLARE Af293 A . fumigatus ( see procedure above for staining protocol ) in 50 µL . WT mice were also infected with unlabeled A . fumigatus to serve as analysis controls ( see below ) . 18 h post infection , mice were euthanized and their lungs harvested into 5 mL of digestion buffer ( PBS with 5 percent FBS , 0 . 1 mg / mL DNAse I , and Type IV collagenase ( Worthington ) at 2 . 2 mg / mL ) . Tissue homogenization was performed using a MACSTm Octo Dissociator for 55 sec at 1302 rpm , followed by slow rotation at 37 ºC for 40 min . A ﬁnal mechanical homogenization was performed for 37 sec at 2079 rpm , after which all samples were diluted with 5 mL of PBS + 5 percent FBS , ﬁltered through a 100 µm pore size cell strainer , and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 ºC . The pellet was resuspended in 2 mL of ACK lysis buffer ( BD ) and incubated for 15 min to achieve red blood cell lysis . After quenching in 4 mL of RPMI - 1640 + 10 percent FBS , cells were centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 ºC , followed by resuspension in cold FACS buffer ( PBS + 5 percent FBS ) . To assess dissemination at 24 h , lungs , dLN , spleen , and 200 µL of blood were harvested from each mouse . Lungs were processed as described above . dLN and spleen were homogenized and ﬁltered through a 100 µm pore size cell strainer . Subsequently , the spleen single cell suspension was centrifuged and resuspended in 2 mL of ACK lysis buffer ( BD ) and incubated for 15 min to achieve red blood cell lysis . After quenching in 4 mL of RPMI - 1640 + 10 percent FBS , cells were centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 ºC , followed by resuspension in cold FACS buffer ( PBS + 5 percent FBS ) .

After quenching in 4 mL of RPMI - 1640 + 10 percent FBS , cells were centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 ºC , followed by resuspension in cold FACS buffer ( PBS + 5 percent FBS ) . Aliquots of 2 × 106 cells from each organ were dispensed into round bottom 96 well plates ( Corning ) and then stained for 20 min at 4 ºC with a viability dye ( Tonbo Ghostdye Violet 510 1 : 250 ) along with antibodies against Ly6G ( BUV395 , 1 : 100 ) , CD11b ( BUV805 , 1 : 100 ) , Siglec F ( BV650 , 1 : 100 ) , CD45 ( BV785 ) , and CD11c ( PE - Cy7 , 1 : 100 ) . Samples were then applied to a CytoFlex LX ﬂow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software . Neutrophils were identiﬁed as CD11b + Ly6G + SiglecF - CD11c - cells . Percent phagocytosis was determined by dividing the total number of AF633 + neutrophils in each sample by the total number of neutrophils . Percent FLARE killing was expressed as the number of AF633 + dsRed - neutrophils over the total number of AF633 + neutrophils in each sample . Gating for AF633 + neutrophils was facilitated using unlabeled neutrophils extracted from mice infected with unlabeled A . fumigatus . To quantify fungal infection , lung suspensions were diluted 50 - fold and 50 µL of each sample was plated on Sabouraud dextrose agar ( ThermoFisher ) .
