A prevailing current view is that endocytosis - promoted signaling from GPCRs is inherently β - arrestin - dependent because β - arrestin is necessary for receptors to internalize and , for some GPCRs , it also promotes G s activation on endosomes . Here we revise this view by showing that the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1 ( VIPR1 ) , a prototypic secretin - family polypeptide hormone receptor , remains bound to β - arrestin after endocytosis but does not require β - arrestin either to internalize or to generate an endosomal signal . β - arrestin instead resolves the endosomal signal into a temporally separated cAMP peak , and it does so by attenuating signaling from the plasma membrane without detectably affecting the endosomal response . The mechanistic basis for this location - specific difference in β - arrestin function is the formation of distinct VIPR1 / β - arrestin complexes at each location . The signal - attenuating complex formed at the plasma membrane does not require GRK - mediated phosphorylation of receptors , while the signaling - neutral complex present on the endosome membrane , in contrast , is GRK - dependent . To our knowledge , the present results provide the first direct demonstration that endosomal GPCR signaling can occur in the complete absence of β - arrestin . They also reveal a discrete role of β - arrestin in sculpting the spatiotemporal profile of cellular GPCR - G protein signaling through the location - specific formation or remodeling of GPCR / β - arrestin complexes . Introduction G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) comprise the largest class of signaling receptors , regulate essentially every physiological process and are important drug targets 1 . Upon binding agonist ligands , GPCRs engage cognate heterotrimeric G proteins to transduce signaling through specific downstream effectors 2 , 3 . The biochemical basis of GPCR activation has been studied to a level of atomic detail 4 , 5 , but we are only now beginning to understand the subcellular organization of GPCR signaling 2 , 6 , 7 . Many GPCRs are not restricted to the plasma membrane and transit the endocytic pathway 8 . However , endocytosis was long believed only to impact the longer - term homeostatic regulation of GPCRs and not affect the response to acute agonist application . This view has changed due to the accumulation of substantial evidence that various GPCRs have the capacity to engage G proteins after endocytosis , as well as from the plasma membrane , and can leverage the endocytic network to promote or sustain cellular signaling 2 , 6 , 7 . Support for this still - evolving view is well - developed for GPCRs that signal by coupling to stimulatory heterotrimeric G proteins ( G s ) which activate adenylyl cyclases to produce cAMP . A number of such GPCRs have now been shown to engage G s on the endosome limiting membrane as well as the plasma membrane , enabling receptors to initiate sequential ‘waves’ of signaling from each location 2 , 6 , 9 – 15 . Numerous studies have demonstrated significant differences in the downstream effects of cAMP generated at the plasma membrane compared to internal membrane compartments , both at the cell and tissue levels 9 , 11 , 13 – 19 , highlighting how spatiotemporal aspects of GPCR activation can profoundly influence functional responses through cAMP . Yet , how such signaling diversity is programmed remains poorly understood . GPCR - elicited cellular cAMP signaling can be determined by many factors , including the ligand’s binding affinity for receptors 10 , 11 and specific features of the receptor’s trafficking itinerary 20 , 21 . One important factor is the interaction between GPCRs and β - arrestin . β - arrestins ( β - arrestin - 1 and β - arrestin - 2 ) were discovered as scaffolding proteins which are recruited to and functionally desensitize activated receptors at the plasma membrane 22 . β - arrestins additionally function as essential endocytic adaptor proteins for many GPCRs , promoting receptor endocytosis via clathrin - coated pits and driving receptor delivery to endosomes 22 , 23 . Polypeptide hormone receptors provide particularly clear examples of such behavior . In particular , the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor ( TSHR ) , parathyroid hormone receptor - 1 ( PTHR1 ) and vasopressin - 2 receptor ( V2R ) have all been extensively shown to produce an endosomal cAMP signal that is inherently β - arrestin - dependent because β - arrestin is required for receptors to internalize 9 – 11 , 17 , 18 , 24 – 27 . In addition , for the PTHR1 and V2R , persistent binding to β - arrestin after internalization has been shown to sustain the endosomal cAMP signal 2 , 11 , 24 – 29 . Accordingly , a prevailing current view in the field is that GPCR signaling from endosomes is strictly β - arrestin - dependent . There has been evidence for many years that some GPCRs can internalize independently of β - arrestin 23 , 30 , and some of these have been shown to produce an endosomal cAMP signal ( e . g . , 14 ) . However , it is not known if endosomal cAMP signaling from such GPCRs can actually occur in the absence of β - arrestin . Indeed , to our knowledge , it has not been determined if any GPCR can produce an endosomal G s - cAMP signal in the absence of β - arrestin . If so , a fundamental next question that arises is whether or how β - arrestin impacts the GPCR - elicited cellular cAMP response in such a case . Here , we address these questions by focusing on the vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 1 ( VIPR1 or VPAC1 ) as a model secretin - subfamily polypeptide hormone GPCR shown previously to associate with β - arrestin both at the plasma membrane and endosome , but whose internalization is insensitive to a dominant negative mutant of β - arrestin 30 , 31 . We show that agonist - induced VIPR1 endocytosis is indeed β - arrestin - independent and then leverage this property to disentangle effects of β - arrestin binding and endocytosis on the cellular cAMP signal produced by endogenous receptor activation . While β - arrestin is clearly not required for endosomal G s activation or cAMP signaling by VIPR1 , we show that it plays a different role in temporally resolving the effects of VIPR1 - G s activation from the plasma membrane and endosomes into separate and sequential peaks of global cytoplasmic cAMP elevation . The present results provide the first direct example of a GPCR for which G s - cAMP signaling is fully β - arrestin - independent and reveal a discrete function of β - arrestin in spatiotemporally sculpting the cell’s overall cAMP response . Results VIPR1 is internalized in β - arrestin double knockout cells despite agonist - induced β - arrestin recruitment to both the plasma membrane and endosomes To determine whether VIPR1 could serve as a model receptor to disentangle the effects of β - arrestin on trafficking and signaling , we first set out to characterize VIPR1 internalization in HEK293 cells . To do so , we used a cell - impermeant HaloTag dye ( JF 635 i - HTL ) to selectively label receptors in the plasma membrane of living cells 32 . As expected 30 , 31 , 33 , 34 , HaloTag - VIPR1 underwent endocytosis in wild type cells upon addition of its agonist , vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) ( Fig . 1a ) . Surface - labeled receptors were visible in intracellular puncta that colocalized with both an overexpressed DsRed - labeled EEA1 and endogenous EEA1 ( Extended Data Fig . 1a - c ) , identifying these structures as early endosomes . Some receptor - positive endosomes were visible even before VIP application , suggesting a low level of constitutive ( agonist - independent ) endocytosis . However , VIP markedly increased receptor localization in DsRed2 - EEA1 - positive endosomes , confirming that VIPR1 endocytosis is stimulated by agonist ( Extended Data Fig . 1a ) . Agonist - induced internalization was further verified and quantified using flow cytometry , which showed an extremely rapid loss of surface receptor labeling that reached completion within 10 minutes of treatment with VIP ( Fig . 1b ) . Both constitutive and agonist - induced components of VIPR1 internalization were observed under conditions in which VIPR1 expression level varies , though higher VIPR1 expression led to lower apparent levels of internalization ( Extended Data Fig . 1d , e ) 34 . After establishing VIPR1 undergoes agonist - induced internalization , we next explored its basic mechanistic properties . Like many other GPCRs , and consistent with previous studies 30 , 31 , VIPR1 endocytosis was dynamin - dependent , as overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of dynamin 1 ( Dyn1 - K44E ) fully suppressed agonist - induced internalization ( Fig . 1c ) . Previous evidence relevant to β - arrestin dependence was based on insensitivity of VIPR1 to endocytic inhibition by dominant negative mutant constructs overexpressed on a wild type background 30 , 31 . In order to test the requirement for β - arrestin in VIPR1 internalization more incisively , we examined the effect of depleting endogenous β - arrestin . We generated two independent mutant HEK293 cell lines lacking both β - arrestin - 1 ( β - arr1 ) and β - arrestin - 2 ( β - arr2 ) using CRISPR . We validated complete β - arrestin knockout in both β - arrestin double knockout ( β - arr DKO ) cell lines biochemically , by genomic DNA sequencing and western blotting ( Extended Data Fig . 2a , b ) , and functionally by loss of β2 - adrenergic receptor ( β2AR ) internalization ( a β - arrestin - dependent GPCR ) ( Fig . 2d ) . Robust internalization of VIPR1 was still observed in β - arr DKO cells , and complete depletion of β - arrestin did not affect the degree or kinetics of agonist - induced internalization in either independent cell line ( Fig . 1d and Extended Data Fig . 2c ) . Therefore , agonist - induced endocytosis of VIPR1 proceeds through a dynamin - dependent , β - arrestin - independent mechanism . As VIPR1 internalization does not require β - arrestin , we wanted to confirm that it indeed recruits β - arrestin after activation by VIP 31 . Live confocal fluorescence imaging demonstrated visible membrane recruitment of β - arr1 after VIP application , first to the plasma membrane and then to endosomes containing internalized VIPR1 ( Fig . 1e ) . We further quantified this sequential β - arrestin recruitment phenotype with a nanoluciferase protein complementation ( NanoBiT ) assay using CAAX motif or endofin - derived FYVE domain constructs as previously validated markers of the plasma membrane and endosome membrane , respectively ( Extended Data Fig . 3 ) 35 . Using this ‘bystander’ assay , we observed sequential recruitment of β - arr2 after VIP - induced activation of VIPR1 , first to the plasma membrane and then to the endosome membrane , with the transition between the two being nearly complete within five minutes ( Fig . 1f ) . VIPR1 mediates sequential phases of cAMP production from the plasma membrane and endosomes These above results indicate that VIPR1 robustly recruits β - arrestin and remains bound to β - arrestin in endosomes , yet it does not require β - arrestin for endocytosis . To our knowledge , these characteristics differentiate VIPR1 from all other GPCRs for which the β - arrestin - dependence of endosomal signaling has been explicitly investigated . This motivated us to ask if VIPR1 is able to generate an endocytosis - dependent cAMP signaling phase . VIPR1 is natively expressed in the kidney 36 , and previous studies have documented endogenous VIPR1 expression in HEK293 cells 31 , 37 , 38 . We first sought to independently verify that endogenous VIPR1 is indeed responsible for the VIP - elicited cAMP elevation measured in our cell model . CRISPR - mediated knockout of VIPR1 strongly suppressed the cytoplasmic cAMP elevation elicited by VIP application , as measured in living cells using a genetically encoded fluorescent cAMP biosensor ( cADDis ) , while VIPR2 knockout had little effect ( Extended Data Fig . 4a - b ) . A small residual cAMP response was still present in VIPR1 knockout cells , and other secretin family GPCRs - - notably the secretin and pituitary adenylate cyclase - activating polypeptide ( PACAP ) receptors - - are also sensitive to VIP 39 , 40 . The PACAP 1 receptor ( PAC1R ) agonist PACAP - 27 produced a detectable cAMP response exceeding that produced by VIP in VIPR1 KO cells , while secretin had no detectable effect ( Extended Data Fig . 4c ) . These observations suggest that the residual VIP response is mediated by low - level expression of PAC1R which displays a ~ 100 - fold lower EC 50 for PACAP - 27 versus VIP ( Extended Data Fig . 4d ) 40 and has been detected in HEK293 by RNA - Seq 38 . However , as this residual contribution to the cellular cAMP elevation is very small when compared to the VIPR1 - mediated response ( Extended Data Fig . 4b ) , we conclude that VIPR1 is indeed the major endogenous GPCR mediating the VIP - induced cAMP elevation measured in this study . Next , we characterized the time course of the VIP - induced cAMP signal , as defined for these experiments by elevation of global cAMP concentration in living cells at 37˚C . Stimulation of HEK293 cells with VIP elicited a complex signal , characterized by an initial phase of cAMP elevation that peaked within < 1 minute and desensitized over ~ 5 minutes followed by a second , less intense peak and a later plateau of cAMP elevation that persisted above baseline in the prolonged presence of VIP ( Fig . 2a , black curve ) . Both of these signaling phases were lost in VIPR1 knockout cells , indicating that both are mediated by VIPR1 ( Extended Data Fig . 4a ) . Furthermore , analysis of cAMP dynamics using quantitative fluorescence microscopy detected both phases in individual cells ( Extended Data Fig . 4e ) . Accordingly , both phases of the complex VIP - induced cellular cAMP signal occur in the same cells and are mediated by endogenous VIPR1 . To investigate how endocytic trafficking impacts this overall cellular cAMP signal , we examined the effect of experimentally imposing endocytic blockade on the global cytoplasmic cAMP elevation . Preventing dynamin - dependent endocytosis of VIPR1 using a chemical inhibitor , Dyngo4a , abolished the second cAMP peak and subsequent plateau elevation without detectably affecting the first peak ( Fig . 2a . , blue curve , and Extended Data Table 1 ) . Genetically imposing endocytic inhibition with Dyn1 - K44E also selectively blocked the second phase ( Fig . 2b ) . These results are consistent with the VIPR1 - mediated cellular cAMP elevation being composed of two sequential phases : a first phase from the plasma membrane producing an initial peak of glocal cAMP elevation , and then a second phase from endosomes producing a subsequent peak and plateau . We further noted that cells pretreated with VIP exhibited an elevated baseline cAMP that persisted after VIP washout , whereas rechallenge with VIP was unable to produce a subsequent additional elevation ( Fig . 2c ) . These results suggest that endosomal cAMP signaling by VIPR1 can be sustained even after agonist removal , despite the plasma membrane signal being terminated and desensitized within several minutes . To further validate the subcellular location ( s ) of ligand - dependent VIPR1 and G s activation , we took advantage of conformational biosensors that detect either active - state VIPR1 ( mini - G s ) 41 , 42 or a conformational intermediate in the process of G s activation ( Nb37 ) 12 , 43 . Using these tools in NanoBiT bystander assays , we observed that VIP promoted the recruitment of both biosensors first to the plasma membrane and then to endosomes ( Fig . 2d , e ) . These results suggest that VIP - induced activation of VIPR1 and G s occurs at both membrane locations , sequentially and with kinetics consistent with the biphasic cytoplasmic cAMP elevation measured using the cAMP biosensor . β - arrestin and endocytosis both promote VIPR1 desensitization at the plasma membrane , but β - arrestin is dispensable for the second endosomal phase of VIPR1 - mediated cAMP signaling Having established the unique spatial and temporal profile of VIPR1 - mediated cAMP signaling , we next asked how β - arrestin regulates it given that VIPR1 trafficking is β - arrestin - independent . To investigate this , we first compared endogenous VIPR1 - mediated cAMP signaling produced in β - arr DKO cells to that produced in the parental ( wild type ) cell background . In β - arr DKO cells , VIP elicited a rapid cAMP peak followed by a decay ( Fig . 3a and Extended Data Fig . 5a ) . Calculating first derivatives and fitting decay time constants to these curves indicated that the initial cAMP peak observed in β - arr DKO cells is slightly more prolonged when compared to that observed in parental wild type cells ( Extended Data Fig 5b , Extended Data Table 1 ) . Nevertheless , the initial cAMP peak measured in β - arr DKO cells still obviously decayed , with β - arr1 / 2 depletion slowing the decay time constant only by ~ 2 - fold . This indicates that a second , β - arrestin - independent mechanism for terminating the initial VIPR1 signaling peak must exist . We found that imposing endocytic blockade with Dyngo4a dramatically prolonged the VIP - induced cAMP elevation measured in β - arr DKO cells ( Fig . 3a , Extended Data Fig . 5a , Extended Data Table 1 ) , in contrast to its much smaller effect in wild type cells . This indicates that endocytosis by itself can terminate the initial VIPR1 - mediated cAMP elevation in cells lacking β - arrestin . That endocytosis itself can attenuate the first cAMP peak without β - arrestin is fully consistent with β - arrestin - independent internalization of VIPR1 , and it suggests that endocytosis and β - arrestin semi - redundantly terminate the first cAMP peak in wild type cells . β - arr1 and β - arr2 are both endogenously expressed in HEK293 cells 38 and , while we observed similar recruitment of each isoform to activated VIPR1 ( Fig . 1e , f ) , we wondered whether the signal - attenuating effect might be unique to one isoform . To explore this question , we measured VIP - induced cAMP signaling in β - arrestin single knockout cell lines ( Extended Data Fig . 5c , d ) . In cells selectively deficient in β - arr1 or β - arr2 , VIP application elicited cAMP elevation similar in kinetics to that observed in wild type cells ( Fig . 3a , Extended Data Table 1 ) . Importantly , in both single KO cell backgrounds , VIPR1 desensitization was observed upon endocytic inhibition , and blocking endocytosis reduced the second phase of signaling to a degree comparable to the reduction observed in wild type cells ( Fig . 3a ) . Therefore , both β - arrestins appear similar in their overall effects on VIPR1 cAMP signaling as assessed with the present methods . While we did not observe a distinct , second cAMP peak in β - arr DKO cells , a plateau above baseline was still observed ( Fig . 3a ) . This contrasts with a complete loss of the cAMP plateau produced by endocytic inhibition in wild type cells ( Fig . 2a , 3a , Extended Data Fig . 5a ) . Further , VIP - induced endosomal recruitment of both mini - G s and Nb37 was still observed in β - arr DKO cells ( Fig . 3b , c , Extended Data Fig . 5e , f ) . Together , these results indicate that β - arrestin is not required for VIPR1 to initiate either the plasma membrane or endosomal phases of G s activation or cAMP elevation . A discrete role of β - arrestin in temporally resolving the VIPR1 - mediated signaling phases If β - arrestin binds active VIPR1 but is not necessary for receptor trafficking or signaling , then what role does it play in modulating VIPR1 activity ? That the β - arr DKO cell lines displayed a broader , Dyngo4a - sensitive cAMP peak compared to the sharply biphasic cAMP production in parental cells suggests β - arrestin sculpts response kinetics . To more precisely investigate this , we pursued genetic rescue in β - arr DKO cells using recombinant β - arr2 ( β - arr2 - mApple ) expressed under tetracycline - inducible control ( DKO - R , Extended Data Fig . 6 ) . As expected , a comparison of real - time cAMP dynamics in these cells indicated that overexpression of β - arr2 ( + Dox ) accelerates the desensitization of the first phase of VIP - induced cytoplasmic cAMP elevation relative to the uninduced ( - Dox ) condition ( Fig . 4a , b and Extended Data Fig . 7a , b ) . We further quantified this effect by fitting decay constants to the desensitization of the first phase , which showed around a two - fold increase upon β - arr2 induction ( Extended Data Table 1 ) , as well as by calculating the first derivative of the curves , which became more negative upon β - arr2 induction ( Extended Data Fig . 7c ) . While we observed a subtle corresponding decrease in Nb37 recruitment to the plasma membrane upon β - arr2 induction , this trend was not statistically significant when assessed across the two independent β - arr DKO cell lines ( Fig . 4c and Extended Data Fig . 7d ) . Some GPCRs that bind β - arrestin in endosomes use this interaction to potentiate cAMP signaling 2 , 11 , 24 – 28 . However , the cellular cAMP elevation observed during the plateau phase of VIPR1 signaling was not detectably affected by β - arr2 overexpression , and the only statistically significant difference in the cAMP elevation with or without β - arr2 overexpression occurred in the first 5 minutes after VIP application ( Fig . 4a , b and Extended Data Fig . 7a , b ) . This observation indicates that β - arrestin , despite attenuating the plasma membrane signaling phase , does not detectably modulate the endosomal cAMP signaling phase either positively or negatively . We returned to the NanoBiT bystander assays to explore this further . In agreement with the bulk cAMP assays , neither mini - G s nor Nb37 recruitment to the endosome was markedly altered by β - arr2 overexpression in the two β - arr DKO cell lines tested ( Fig . 4d , e , Extended Data Fig . 7e , f ) . Together , these data verify that β - arrestin is not necessary for VIPR1 - mediated signaling from endosomes and indicate that β - arrestin binding differentially modulates VIPR1 signaling activity depending on the subcellular location of the complex . The net effect of this selective modulation , with β - arrestin complex formation at the plasma membrane being signal - attenuating and at endosomes being signaling - neutral , is to cause the plasma membrane and endosomal signaling phases to resolve as separate cAMP peaks . Accordingly , β - arrestin’s primary function in VIPR1 signaling appears to be to convert distinct phases of VIPR1 - Gs activation that are initiated from spatially resolved subcellular locations into temporally resolved phases of global cytoplasmic cAMP elevation . GRK - mediated phosphorylation of VIPR1 differentially regulates β - arrestin binding at the plasma membrane and endosomes Our data using the β - arr DKO rescue cell lines indicate that VIPR1 - β - arrestin complexes are functionally different depending on their subcellular localization . To begin to investigate the biochemical underpinnings of these functional differences , we explored how GRK - mediated phosphorylation of VIPR1 affects complex formation at the plasma membrane and endosomes . Chemical inhibition of GRK2 / 3 in HEK293 cells using Compound 101 ( Cmpd101 ) 44 did not significantly affect VIP - stimulated recruitment of β - arr2 to the plasma membrane , but it strongly inhibited recruitment to endosomes ( Fig . 5a , b ) . This differential effect of Cmpd101 on β - arrestin recruitment elicited by VIPR1 at each membrane location stands in contrast to recruitment of β - arrestin by V2R , a GPCR that also binds β - arrestin at both locations 11 , 45 . For the V2R , Cmpd101 markedly inhibited β - arr2 recruitment at both the plasma membrane and endosomes ( Extended Data Fig . 8a , b ) . The selective effect on endosomal recruitment of β - arrestin was not due to a lack of VIPR1 internalization , as Cmpd101 had no effect on the agonist - induced endocytosis of VIPR1 ( Extended Data Fig . 8c ) . Further , a direct NanoBiT assay examining the time course of VIPR1 / β - arr2 binding indicated that complex sensitivity to Cmpd101 is itself location - dependent , with observed inhibition increasing at later time points ( > 5 min VIP ) that correspond to when receptors are present in endosomes ( Fig . 5c ) . Providing genetic confirmation of this pharmacological result , VIPR1 / β - arr2 complexes were rapidly formed but transient in ΔGRK2 / 3 / 5 / 6 cells 46 ( Fig . 5d ) . Together , these results strongly suggest that VIPR1 / β - arrestin complexes formed at the plasma membrane and endosomes are biochemically as well as functionally distinct . The VIPR1 / β - arrestin complex which terminates signaling at the plasma membrane does not require GRK - mediated phosphorylation of receptors to form . The complex present on the endosome limiting membrane that is signaling - neutral , in marked contact , is specifically GRK - dependent ( Fig . 5e ) . Discussion The present findings take advantage of the distinct trafficking properties of VIPR1 to disentangle the effects of β - arrestin and endocytosis on the G s - coupled cellular cAMP response elicited by this GPCR . By doing so , our results establish VIPR1 as a GPCR that is capable of internalizing and initiating a second phase of endosomal G s - cAMP signaling in the complete absence of β - arrestin . We further show that β - arrestin plays a different role in determining the cellular VIPR1 response by resolving the plasma membrane and endosome signaling phases into separate and sequential global cAMP peaks . We note that a number of GPCRs internalize in a β - arrestin - independent manner 23 , 30 , and some , such as the glucagon - like peptide - 1 receptor ( GLP1R ) , have also separately been shown to signal from endosomes 14 . However , to our knowledge , the present results are the first to explicitly show , for any GPCR , generation of an endosomal G s - cAMP signal in the complete absence of cellular β - arrestin . Accordingly , we propose to revise the present concept of endosomal signaling by GPCRs and , in particular , expand the understanding of how receptor interactions with β - arrestin impact the spatiotemporal profile of cAMP signaling ( Fig . 6 ) . For receptors that weakly bind β - arrestin , exemplified by the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor ( TSHR ) , β - arrestin enables signaling to occur from endosomes by promoting receptor internalization before dissociating 9 , 47 . For some receptors that more strongly bind β - arrestin , exemplified by PTHR1 and V2R , β - arrestin enhances the endosomal signal by remaining bound to form a signal - boosting complex specifically on the endosome membrane 2 , 24 – 26 , 28 . In the case of VIPR1 , β - arrestin is not required to generate the endosomal signal . Rather , it sculpts receptor activity such that sequential peaks of receptor / G protein activation initiated from different subcellular locations – the plasma membrane and endosomes – are resolved into temporally separated peaks of global cytoplasmic cAMP elevation . As β - arrestin is not needed even to deliver receptors to the endosome , this third mode of endosomal signaling reveals a discrete function of β - arrestin in regulating the spatiotemporal profile of the integrated cellular cAMP signal . Because other GPCRs have been reported to internalize independently of β - arrestin 23 , 30 , we anticipate that the additional endosomal signaling mode and β - arrestin function revealed in the present study is not unique to VIPR1 and likely underlies GPCR - specific modulation of cellular signaling more broadly . β - arrestin mediates this signal - sculpting function by selectively accelerating the rate at which the plasma membrane signaling phase is attenuated while having little or no effect on the endosomal signaling phase . The mechanistic basis for this specificity in β - arrestin function appears to be the presence of distinct GPCR / β - arrestin complexes at the plasma membrane relative to at the endosome limiting membrane , as established here by differences in their dependence on GRK - mediated receptor phosphorylation for formation or stability . This supports the emerging view that GPCR / β - arrestin complexes dynamically remodel during endocytic trafficking to enable location - specific control 25 , 28 , 29 , 48 , 49 . Further investigation will be needed to determine the biophysical basis for this biochemical distinction . Transition from a ‘core engaged’ GPCR / β - arrestin complex to a ‘tail engaged’ complex is thought to underlie the ability of β - arrestin to switch from a signal - attenuating factor at the plasma membrane to a signal - enhancing factor at the endosome for receptors such as PTHR 25 , 28 , 29 . Therefore , a simple model is that the signal - attenuating VIPR1 / β - arrestin complex formed at the plasma membrane corresponds to a receptor ‘core - engaged’ complex that can form in the absence of a phosphorylated receptor tail , while the signaling - neutral VIPR1 / β - arrestin complex formed at endosomes corresponds to a phosphorylation - dependent ‘tail - engaged’ complex ( Fig 5e ) . While there are examples of signaling neutral GPCR - β - arrestin mutant complexes that are permissive of G protein signaling without modulating the cAMP response 28 , 50 , it remains unclear how a signaling - neutral VIPR1 - β - arrestin complex may be distinct from previously described ‘tail engaged’ signal - enhancing GPCR - β - arrestin complexes . Thus , we anticipate that additional diversity exists in GPCR / β - arrestin complex formation to enable the functional signaling properties of GPCRs to be precisely tuned in a receptor - specific manner , and according to differences in the post - translational modification of receptors at discrete membrane locations . Methods Cell culture HEK293 ( ATCC CRL - 1573 ) and HEK239A ΔGRK2 / 3 / 5 / 6 46 were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM , Gibco 1196511 ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Hyclone SH30910 . 03 ) .

Briefly , cells were treated with cADDis BacMam and plated into 96 - well plates ( Corning 3340 ) . After 24 hours , cells were washed with assay buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 135 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 0 . 4 mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 8 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM d - glucose ) twice before a 10 minute incubation in a 37°C plate reader ( Synergy H4 , BioTek ) , optionally with DMSO or Dyngo4a ( 30 μM , Abcam ab120689 ) as indicated in figure legends .

Imaging was conducted using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope fitted with a Nikon 20x / 0 . 7 NA objective , Sutter Lambda HPX - L5 LED epifluorescence illuminator , Sutter excitation / emission filter wheels and Point Grey CMOS camera controlled by Micromanager 53 ( www . micro - manager . org ) . A dual channel dichroic filter set ( Chroma 89021 ) was used to separately acquire cADDis ( 470 / 40 excitation , 520 / 50 emission ) and mCherry ( 572 / 35 excitation , 632 / 60 emission ) fluorescence signals . Cells were maintained at 37˚C during image collection using a custom - built heated stage and stage top incubator . 1 µM VIP was added after a 2 minute baseline , and forskolin ( Fsk , 10 µM , MilliporeSigma ) and 3 - isobutyl - 1 - methylxanthine ( IBMX , 500 µM , MilliporeSigma ) were added 30 minutes later . Data was processed using Cell Profiler 4 54 ( www . cellprofiler . org ) . Briefly , cells were identified using the mCherry channel , and the intensity of the cADDis channel was measured over the entire image and in the cell mask . Each frame was background corrected by subtracting the lower quartile fluorescence intensity of the entire image . The normalized change in fluorescence of the cell mask was calculated as ( F – F 0 ) / ( F FskIBMX - F 0 ) , where F 0 is the average fluorescence over the first two minutes and F FskIBMX is the average fluorescence of the final two minutes . Each biological replicate is the average of 1 - 2 dishes of approximately 20 - 30 cells per dish . NanoBiT luciferase complementation assays Cells grown in 6 - well plates were transfected with receptor ( HaloTag - VIPR1 or FLAG - V2R ) and the appropriate LgBit / SmBiT constructs 24 hours prior to experiments . Experiments using Nb37 - SmBiT ( 114 ) ( Fig . 4c , Extended Data Fig . 7d ) or Nb37 - SmBiT ( 101 ) ( all other figures ) also required the cotransfection of a tricistronic G protein construct ( human G ꞵ 1 , bovine Gγ1 , and human G ⍺ s ) . For the assay , cells were lifted and centrifuged at 500 x g for 3 minutes . Cells were resuspended in assay buffer supplemented with 5 µM coelenterazine - H ( Research Products International ) to a concentration of 5x10 5 or 1x10 6 cells / mL , and 100 µL of cells were plated into untreated white 96 - well plates ( Corning 3912 ) . Plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 for 10 minutes prior to the assay , optionally with DMSO or Cmpd101 ( 30 μM , HelloBio HB2840 ) as indicated in figure legends . Luminescence was read on a plate reader ( Synergy H4 , BioTek ) prewarmed to 37 °C . After a 5 minute baseline reading , vehicle or agonist were added at concentrations indicated in figure legends , and luminescence was read for another 30 minutes . To calculate the change in luminescence , each well was first normalized to its average baseline luminescence , and the average change in luminescence for vehicle - treated samples was subtracted from the average change in luminescence for drug - treated samples ( ΔLum = Lum VIP - Lum vehicle ) . To compare DMSO - and Cmpd101 - treated samples , readings were further normalized to the maximum ΔLum of the DMSO - treated sample ( Norm ΔLum ) . Confocal microscopy All fixed and live confocal imaging was carried out using a Nikon Ti inverted microscope fitted with a CSU - 22 spinning disk unit ( Yokogawa ) , custom laser launch ( 100 mW at 405 , 488 , 561 , and 640 nm , Coherent OBIS ) , Sutter emission filter wheel and Photometrics Evolve Delta EMCCD camera . Samples were imaged using an Apo TIRF 100x / 1 . 49 NA oil objective ( Nikon ) . For live imaging , cells were transfected with the appropriate constructs 48 hours prior to experiments and plated into glass bottom dishes ( Cellvis ) coated with 0 . 001 % ( w / v ) poly - L - lysine ( Millipore Sigma ) . For surface labeling of receptor , cells were incubated with either monoclonal anti - FLAG M1 antibody ( Millipore Sigma F3040 ) labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 ( Thermo Fisher A20186 ) or 200 nM JF 635 i - HTL 32 for 10 minutes at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . After three washes , cells were imaged in assay media ( DMEM , no phenol red , 30 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 ) in a temperature - and humidity - controlled chamber ( Okolab ) . For time - lapse , cells were imaged at 20 second intervals for 22 minutes , with 500 nM VIP added after 2 minutes . For fixed imaging , cells were transfected with the appropriate constructs 48 hours prior to experiments and plated onto coverslips ( Fisher Scientific 12 - 545 - 100P ) coated with 0 . 001 % ( w / v ) poly - L - lysine ( Millipore Sigma ) . Coverslips were washed with assay media ( DMEM , no phenol red , 30 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 ) and labeled with 200 nM JF 635 i - HTL for 10 minutes at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . Vehicle or 500 nM VIP was added for 20 minutes , followed by washes with PBS and fixation in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde ( Fisher , F79 ) in modified BRB80 ( 80 mM PIPES pH 6 . 8 , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM CaCl2 ) for 20 minutes . For immunofluorescence , cells were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 in 3 % BSA before incubation with primary and secondary antibodies ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using ProLong Gold Antifade mounting media ( Invitrogen P10144 ) . All image analysis was carried out in Cell Profiler 4 54 , and all images for figures were processed using Fiji 51 . For colocalization analysis , the Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated in individual cells segmented manually . Receptor internalization by flow cytometry All experiments were carried out using cell lines stably expressing an N - terminal HaloTag fusion of the receptor of interest . Unless otherwise noted , all experiments use HaloTag - VIPR1 under the control of an inducible promoter ( TRE3G ) in either a VIPR1 KO or β - arr1 / 2 DKO cell background . For experiments using mCherry and mCherry - Dyn1K44E , cells were incubated with BacMam for 24 hours prior to the experiment . Agonist or vehicle was added to cells grown in 12 - well plates coated with 0 . 001 % ( w / v ) poly - L - lysine ( Millipore Sigma ) and incubated at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 as indicated in figure legends . At the end of the incubation , plates were cooled on ice for 10 minutes , and all subsequent steps were carried out on ice . Cells were then labeled with 200 nM JF 635 i - HTL for 30 minutes . After washing once with PBS - EDTA ( UCSF Cell Culture Facility ) , cells were lifted with 100 uL of TrypLE Express ( Thermo Fisher ) at room temperature for 10 minutes . TrypLE was quenched with 150 uL PBS - EDTA + 2 . 5 % FBS , and resuspended cells were transferred into an untreated black 96 - well plate ( Corning ) . Data from 10 , 000 events was collected on an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer equipped with a CytKick Autosampler ( Thermo Fisher ) . JF 635 i - HTL was measured with a 637 nm excitation laser and a 670 / 14 nm emission filter , while mCherry was measured with a 561 nm excitation laser and a 620 / 15 nm emission filter . Data were analyzed using FlowJo v10 . 8 Software ( BD Life Sciences ) . Populations were gated for cells expressing mCherry , when applicable ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Surface receptor was calculated as the normalized median fluorescence ( JF 635 i ) . Statistical analysis and reproducibility All data are shown as individual biological replicates or as a mean ± standard deviation from at least 3 biologically independent experiments . Each biological replicate in the cAMP , NanoBiT , and flow cytometry assays represents the average of at least two technical replicates , and all images are representative of at least 3 biologically independent experiments . Rate constants , derivatives , and statistical tests were carried out using Prism 8 / 9 ( GraphPad ) as noted in figure legends . Acknowledgements We thank D . Gordon and A .

Upon VIP stimulation , VIPR1 is phosphorylated by GRKs , leading to the recruitment of β - arrestin to VIPR1 at both the plasma membrane and endosomes . If VIPR1 phosphorylation by GRKs is blocked , β - arrestin is still recruited to VIPR1 at the plasma membrane , but a VIPR1 - β - arrestin complex does not form at the endosome . For all panels , data represent three biological replicates shown as mean ± s . d . Fig . 6 VIPR1 defines a third mode of endosomal GPCR signaling . Diagram illustrates key distinctions among signaling modes . Mode 1 : β - arrestin enables signaling from endosomes by promoting receptor internalization and then dissociating . Mode 2 : β - arrestin promotes receptor internalization and then remains bound after internalization to form a signal - sustaining endosomal megaplex . Mode 3 : β - arrestin is not required for receptor internalization or signaling from endosomes ; instead , β - arrestin sculpts the resulting combined signal output , such that the plasma membrane and endosomal signal phases produce temporally resolved cAMP peaks .
