Recently , it was demonstrated that human Merkel cell polyomavirus ( MCV ) is clonally integrated in (cid:1) 80 % of MCC tumors . However , direct evidence for whether oncogenic viral proteins are needed for the maintenance of MCC cells is still missing . To address this question , we knocked down MCV T - antigen ( TA ) expression in MCV - positive MCC cell lines using three different short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) - expressing vectors targeting exon 1 of the TAs . The MCC cell lines used include three newly generated MCV - infected cell lines and one MCV - negative cell line from MCC tumors . Notably , all MCV - positive MCC cell lines underwent growth arrest and / or cell death upon TA knockdown , whereas the proliferation of MCV - negative cell lines remained unaffected . Despite an increase in the number of annexin V - positive , 7 - amino - actinomycin D ( 7 - AAD ) - negative cells upon TA knockdown , activation of caspases or changes in the expression and phosphorylation of Bcl - 2 family members were not consistently detected after TA suppression . Our study provides the ﬁrst direct experimental evidence that TA expression is necessary for the maintenance of MCV - positive MCC and that MCV is the infectious cause of MCV - positive MCC . Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) is a highly aggressive neu - roendocrine skin cancer . Although it is rare , its reported incidence is increasing ( 19 ) . MCC is associated with UV exposure and affects primarily elderly and immune - sup - pressed patients ( 5 , 11 , 17 , 26 ) . The susceptibility of MCC to immune surveillance is similar to that of known virus - in - duced cancers and suggests that MCC has an infectious trigger ( 9 ) . Recently , a new human polyomavirus , termed Merkel cell polyomavirus ( MCV ) , was discovered to be clonally integrated into MCC tumor genomes ( 14 ) . While MCV integration occurs at distinct sites in MCC tumors from different individuals , primary tumors and correspond - ing metastases have identical integration sites , consistent with the occurrence of MCV infection and integration prior to clonal expansion and metastasis ( 14 , 37 ) . A number of studies have conﬁrmed that MCV is present in 69 to 85 % of MCC tumors collected from Europe and the United States ( 4 , 15 , 21 , 41 ) . Surveys of control non - MCC skin , hema - tolymphoid , and neuroendocrine tumors are generally neg - ative for MCV , although incidental low - level infection can be detected ( 4 , 14 , 22 , 33 , 34 , 39 , 42 , 44 ) . All polyomaviruses encode alternatively spliced large T ( LT ) and small T ( sT ) antigen transcripts that share exon 1 of the T - antigen ( TA ) locus . Additional multiply spliced TA transcripts have been described for different polyomaviruses , including the 17kT and 57kT antigens in simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) and MCV , respectively ( 40 , 46 ) . Research on viral proteins encoded by the TA locus has been central to uncovering cell signaling networks important in cancer biology ( 10 , 38 ) . The targeting of cellular proteins , such as retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) , p53 , and protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) , by TAs contributes to polyomavirus - induced cell transformation ( for reviews , see references 1 and 2 ) . MCV TAs that are expressed in MCC tumors lack a putative p53 binding domain because of tumor - associated T - antigen deletion mutations ( 37 , 40 ) . Other conserved tumor suppressor - targeting motifs , including the Rb binding domain ( LXCXE motif ) , the J domain ( HPDK ) in LT / 57kT , and a putative PP2A interaction domain in sT , remain intact ( 40 ) . Current data point toward MCV as the infectious cause for most Merkel cell cancers : the virus is associated with MCC tumors and , when present , expresses T antigen in tumor cells but not in healthy surrounding tissues ( 7 , 20 , 39 ) . MCV is speciﬁc to MCC and is not detected at signiﬁcant levels in other cancers or in healthy skin examined to date , despite widespread circulation of MCV among human populations ( 8 , 23 , 29 , 42 ) . Clonal analysis of MCC tumors also supports the correct temporal relationship for causality ; i . e . , MCV infection occurs prior to MCC tumor development ( 18 ) . If MCV is a direct cause of MCC tumorigenesis , it is expected that MCC tumors will require MCV protein expression to maintain the tumor phenotype—the so - called oncogene addiction . To address this question , we generated four new MCC cell lines that were examined together with previously established MCC and non - MCC cell lines . Using two independent meth - ods , we show that short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) targeting of the MCV T antigens initiates cell cycle arrest and cell death only in MCV - positive MCC cells . Thus , MCV TA expression is nec - * Corresponding author . Mailing address : Molecular Virology Pro - gram , University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute , 5117 Centre Ave . , Pittsburgh , PA 15213 .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Ethics statement . This study analyzing human cell lines was conducted accord - ing to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki . The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Wu¨rzburg University Hospital ( Ethikkommission der Medizinischen Fakulta¨t der Universita¨t Wu¨rzburg ; se - quential study number 124 / 05 ) and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute ( protocol 96 - 099 ) . All patients provided written informed consent for the col - lection of samples and subsequent analysis . Cell culture . Table 1 provides information on the origin and in vitro features of the MCC cell lines used in this study . We established four permanently growing cell lines derived from patients with histologically conﬁrmed MCC ( BroLi , WaGa , MS - 1 , and MaTi ) . BroLi , WaGa , MS - 1 , MKL - 1 ( 40 ) , and MKL - 2 ( 42a ) were positive for MCV DNA by PCR . Clonal integration of the MCV genome was conﬁrmed by Southern blotting for MKL - 1 , MKL - 2 , and MS - 1 ( data not shown ) . UISO ( 35 ) , MCC13 ( 27 ) , and MaTi are MCV - negative MCC cell lines . FM88 is a melanoma cell line ( 3 ) , and Jurkat ( 16 ) is a T - cell line . All cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( except for MS - 1 at 20 % FBS ) , 100 U / ml penicillin , and 0 . 1 mg / ml streptomycin . For lentiviral infections , cell counting , or ﬂow cytometric analysis MKL - 1 , MKL - 2 , BroLi , MS - 1 , and MaTi cells were dissociated by incubation in a trypsin – EDTA solution . Immunoblotting . Cells were lysed in protein extraction buffer ( either 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate [ SDS ] , 150 mM NaCl , and 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] or 0 . 6 % SDS , 1 mM EDTA , 10 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 2 mM NaF , and 2 mM NaVO 3 ) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Diagnostics ) . Samples were resolved by SDS - poly - acrylamide gel electrophoresis and were transferred to nitrocellulose mem - branes . Followin g 1 h ofblocking with Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) containing 0 . 05 % Tween 20 and 5 % powdered skim milk , membranes were incubated overnight with a primary antibody , washed three times with TBS with 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ( TBS - T ) , and then incubated with a peroxidase - coupled secondary antibody . Bands were detected using a Western Lightning Plus - ECL chemilumi - nescence detection kit ( Perkin - Elmer ) . To detect MCV TA proteins , monoclonal antibodies CM2B4 , recognizing MCV LT ( 39 ) , and CM8E6 , recognizing both the LT and sT proteins ( 25 ) , were used as reported previously . Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to cleaved poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) , cleaved caspase - 3 , cleaved caspase - 9 , Bcl - 2 , phospho - Bcl - 2 ( Ser70 ) , phospho - Bcl - 2 ( Ser56 ) , Bcl - xL , Mcl - 1 , Bad , phospho - Bad ( Ser112 ) , Bax , Bik , Bim , Bmf , and Puma ( Cell Signal - ing ) and a mouse monoclonal antibody to p53 DO - 1 ( Santa Cruz ) were used at 1 : 1 , 000 . As an internal control , a monoclonal antibody to (cid:2) - tubulin was used at 1 : 2 , 500 . shRNA constructs and lentiviral infection . For the green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - selectable knockdown system , a shRNA sequence ( sense strand , 5 (cid:3) - GAT CCA CAA GCT CAG AAG TGA CTT CTC TAT TCA AGA GAT AGA GAA GTC ACT TCT GAG CTT GTG GAT TTT TTT G - 3 (cid:3) ) designed to target nucleotides 391 to 419 ( GenBank accession number EU375803 ) present in all 4 T - antigen mRNAs was cloned into the lentiviral vector KH1 ( 43 ) by using SmaI - XbaI sites to generate TA . GFP . For control purposes , a scrambled KH1 shRNA construct provided by Monique Verhaegen ( 43 ) was used . For the puromycin - selectable knockdown system , shRNA sequences designed to target nucleotides 222 to 242 ( sense strand , 5 (cid:3) - CCG GAA GAG AGG CTC TCT GCA AGC TCT CGA GAG CTT GCA GAG AGC CTC TCT TTT TTG - 3 (cid:3) ) and nucleotides 173 to 193 ( sense strand , 5 (cid:3) - CCG GAA CTC CTT CTG CAT ATA GAC ATC AAG AGT GTC TAT ATG CAG AAG GAG TTT TTT TG - 3 (cid:3) ) were individually cloned at AgeI and EcoRI sites of the pLKO . 1 lentiviral vector to generate T1 . puro and T2 . puro , respectively . The control plasmid pLKO . 1 , which has a scrambled nontargeting short hairpin RNA sequence , was obtained from Addgene . Lentiviruses for the KH1 GFP constructs were produced in HEK293T cells using pRSV rev , pHCMV - G , and pMDLg / pRRE helper con - structs . Lentiviruses for the puromycin pLKO constructs were produced in HEK293FT cells ( Invitrogen ) using pPax2 and pMD2 . G helper constructs . Two or 3 days following transfection , virus supernatants were harvested and ﬁltered through 0 . 45 - (cid:4) m - pore - size ﬁlters . For infection , virus - containing supernatants were supplemented with 1 (cid:4) g / ml Polybrene and were then added to the target cells for 4 h ( WaGa cells , which are sensitive to Polybrene ) or overnight ( other cell lines ) . Following incubation with virus , cells were washed twice with medium . Since KH1 also encodes GFP , the infection rate could be determined by ﬂow cytometry ( FACScanto ; BD Biosciences ) . Equal virus titers for TA shRNA and the scrambled viruses were ensured by serial dilutions of the viruses applied to MCC13 cells , giving equal infection efﬁciencies as measured on day 4 following infection . Infectious titers for puromycin - selectable shRNA vectors determined in UISO cells ranged from 5 (cid:5) 10 (cid:6) 6 to 20 (cid:5) 10 (cid:6) 6 CFU / ml . This indicates that growth failure in MCV - positive cell lines is not due to a low titer of shRNA virus . In order to improve infection rates , it was necessary to dissociate spheroidal growing cells as well as to include 1 (cid:4) g / ml Polybrene ; both measures are accom - panied by some degree of death of MCC cells , as indicated by a major sub - G 1 population on day 7 after infection with Sc . GFP ( see Fig . 6B ) . GFP assay . GFP expression by KH1 - infected cells was used to compare the behavior of infected and uninfected cells : on day 1 following infection , the cells were mixed with approximately 20 % Polybrene ( 1 (cid:4) g / ml ) - treated , uninfected TABLE 1 .

Immunoblotting , however , demonstrates that in BroLi , LT is truncated in a manner typical of MCC ( Fig . 2 ) .

Starting from day 4 postinfection , the frequency of GFP - positive cells in this mixture was determined in a time course . Cell proliferation and cell viability analyses . At 48 h after lentiviral infection , 10 4 infected UISO or MCC13 cells or 2 . 5 (cid:5) 10 4 infected cells from MCV - positive cell lines ( MKL - 1 , MKL - 2 , WaGa , and MS - 1 ) were seeded in 96 - well plates with 150 (cid:4) l growth medium containing puromycin ( 1 (cid:4) g / ml ) . From day 3 postinfec - tion , the growth was monitored in the presence of puromycin using the WST - 1 assay reagent ( Roche ) according to the instruction manual . Due to the low efﬁciency of lentiviral infection in WaGa cells , the proliferation assay was per - formed after puromycin selection starting at day 6 postinfection . WST - 1 is a tetrazolium salt that , when in contact with metabolically active cells , is cleaved to formazan by mitochondrial dehydrogenases . MTS [ 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 5 - ( 3 - carboxymethoxyphenyl ) - 2 - ( 4 - sulfophenyl ) - 2H - tetrazolium ] is a similar tet - razolium reagent that can be used to determine the metabolic activity in cell cultures . The MTS assay ( Promega ) was used for Sc . GFP - and TA . GFP - infected cells , which contained at least 80 % infected GFP - positive cells on day 4 postin - fection and were not subjected to any kind of selection . Annexin V assay . The annexin V - phycoerythrin ( PE ) apoptosis detection kit I ( BD Pharmingen , San Diego , CA ) was used to identify apoptotic cells by ﬂow cytometry . According to the manufacturer’s instructions , the cells were double stained with PE - labeled annexin V and the DNA - intercalating agent 7 - amino - actinomycin D ( 7 - AAD ) . Analysis was performed on a FACSCanto ﬂow cytom - eter ( BD Biosciences , Heidelberg , Germany ) . In order to analyze the infected cells exclusively , they were gated on GFP . Subsequently , the early apoptotic cells were identiﬁed as the 7 - AAD (cid:6) annexin V (cid:7) cells . Cell cycle analysis . To determine the proportion of cells in different phases of the cell cycle , analysis of cellular DNA content was performed . Dissociated single cells were pelleted and resuspended in 0 . 5 ml phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) supplemented with 1 % fetal calf serum . Five milliliters of ice - cold ethanol ( 100 % ) was added , followed by overnight incubation at 4°C . Fixed cells were pelleted ; resuspended in 1 ml PBS supplemented with 1 % fetal calf serum , 0 . 05 mg / ml propidium iodide ( PI ) , and 0 . 1 mg / ml RNase A ; and incubated fo r 1 h at 37°C . Analysis was performed on a FACSCanto ﬂow cytometer . For bromode - oxyuridine ( BrdU ) incorporation , MCV - positive cell lines were infected with the lentiviral shRNA vector Sc . puro or T1 . puro . To eliminate uninfected cells , pu - romycin ( 1 (cid:4) g / ml ) was added to the culture medium for 4 days starting at day 2 postinfection . At day 8 postinfection , cells were labeled with 10 (cid:4) M BrdU for 3 h . BrdU incorporation was assayed using an anti - BrdU monoclonal antibody ( BD Biosciences ) , followed by PI staining as described above . Dead cells were gated out in this assay . Statistical analysis . Statistical analysis ( by the Mann - Whitney test ) was per - formed using GraphPad Prism software ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , CA ) . RESULTS Expression of MCV T antigen in MCV - positive MCC cell lines . The MCV TA locus expresses alternatively spliced tran - scripts encoding the LT , sT , and 57kT proteins ( 39 , 40 ) , which share an identical N - terminal amino acid sequence encoded by exon 1 of LT ( Fig . 1 ) . We examined MCV TA expression in a panel of established MCV - positive ( MKL - 1 and MKL - 2 [ 42a , 40 ] ) and MCV - negative ( UISO [ 35 ] and MCC - 13 [ 27 ] ) MCC cell lines , as well as in four newly established MCC cell lines ( BroLi , MaTi , WaGA , and MS - 1 ) . WaGa , BroLi , and MS - 1 are positive for MCV DNA , whereas MaTi is negative ( Ta - ble 1 ) . Immunoblotting for an exon 2 epitope with antibody CM2B4 conﬁrmed LT protein expression in MKL - 1 , MKL - 2 , BroLi , WaGa , and MS - 1 cells ( Fig . 2A ) . LT bands range in size from 40 kDa ( MKL - 2 ) to 60 kDa ( MS - 1 ) , consistent with the differ - ent tumor - derived truncating LT mutations that were deter - mined for these cell lines ( Table 1 ) . However , the apparent molecular weights are higher than the predicted molecular weights , and several cell lines ( MKL - 1 , BroLi , and WaGa ) show multiple LT bands , suggesting posttranslational LT mod - iﬁcation and aberrant splicing events . Similar LT banding pat - terns were replicated by immunoblotting with CM8E6 ( Fig . 2B ) , a monoclonal antibody recognizing an exon 1 epitope common to all TA isoforms , including the sT protein ( 18 kDa ) , which is not affected by truncating mutations ( Fig . 1 ) . MCV - negative UISO , MCC13 , and MaTi cells do not express any MCV TA isoforms , although a prominent nonspeciﬁc signal is present at 75 kDa in all cell lines immunoblotted with antibody CM8E6 . Knockdown of T antigen interferes with the proliferation and survival of MCV - positive MCC cells . To determine if MCV TA expression is required for MCV - positive cell line survival , two independent strategies to knock down all TA mRNAs by targeting exon 1 were developed ; the results of these experiments were mutually conﬁrmatory . Locations of knockdown targeting sequences are shown in Fig . 1 . The ﬁrst strategy targeted MCV TA exon 1 using the shRNA lentiviral vector KH1 , which also encodes green ﬂuorescent protein ( shTA . GFP ) ( 43 ) . Flow cytometry analysis of cells infected with shTA . GFP or its scrambled control ( shSc . GFP ) virus demonstrated general infection rates ranging from 75 to 95 % ; one exception , however , was the MCV - negative cell line MaTi , in which less than 50 % of cells were infectible . In the second approach , puromycin - selectable lentiviral shRNA vectors ( shT1 . puro and shT2 . puro ) , which allowed for enrichment of infected cells prior to further analysis , were used . Immunoblot - ting conﬁrmed the efﬁcient knockdown of LT and sT protein FIG . 1 . Structure of the exon 1 and exon 2 junctions for MCV T - antigen mRNAs . The large T ( LT ) and 57kT proteins are identically encoded by exon 1 and exon 2 but differ due to downstream alternative splicing in exon 2 ( not shown ) . sT translation extends beyond the LT / 57kT exon 1 donor site but does not include exon 2 . Antibody CM8E6 recognizes all TAs , whereas CM2B4 detects only the LT and 57kT proteins encoded by exon 2 . The sequences targeted by the three TA shRNAs used in this study are located within shared regions of exon 1 and are anticipated to target all TA isoforms . 7066 HOUBEN ET AL . J .

The impact of shTA . GFP infection on cell growth was ana - lyzed in mixed cultures of infected and uninfected cells ( dis - tinguished by the presence or absence of green ﬂuorescence ) for the different cell lines . In all 5 MCV - positive cell lines ( MKL - 1 , WaGa , BroLi , MKL - 2 , and MS - 1 ) , a gradual loss of green ﬂuorescent cells was observed over time with shTA . GFP infection , but not with shSc . GFP infection ( Fig . 4A ) . This is consistent with decreased proliferation and / or survival upon TA knockdown . MTS assays performed on MCV - positive shTA . GFP - infected cells conﬁrmed the decrease in metabolic activity 8 to 15 days after infection compared with the activity of cells infected with shSc . GFP ( data not shown ) . In contrast , none of the 5 MCV - negative cell lines ( MCC13 , MaTi , UISO , FM88 , and Jurkat ) infected with shTA . GFP or shSc . GFP showed a decrease in cell proliferation over time , as indicated by stable ratios of green ﬂuorescent to nonﬂuorescent cells ( Fig . 4A ) . A proliferation assay applying the tetrazolium compound Wst - 1 was used to assess the fate of cells infected with puro - mycin - selectable vectors . Consistent with the results of GFP lentivirus knockdown experiments , MCV - positive MKL - 1 , WaGa , MKL - 2 , and MS - 1 cells infected with shT1 . puro or shT2 . puro failed to grow ( Fig . 4B ) , while cells of the MCV - negative cell lines UISO ( Fig . 4B ) and MCC13 ( data not shown ) proliferated with kinetics similar to that of the respec - tive shSc . puro - infected controls . In an attempt to differentiate between sT and LT effects , two different shRNA viruses tar - geting the TA intron 1 region were tested ( Fig . 1 ) . Both failed to suppress sT expression ; therefore , we cannot distinguish LT from sT effects , although experiments to dissect the contribu - tions of each of these isoforms to cell survival are ongoing . T - antigen loss results in caspase - independent cell death and cell cycle arrest . To distinguish between induction of cell death FIG . 2 . T - antigen expression in MCC cell lines . Total - cell lysates of the indicated cell lines were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies CM2B4 ( A ) and CM8E6 ( B ) . MCC cell lines MKL - 1 , WaGa , BroLi , MS - 1 , and MKL - 2 express MCV TAs , whereas UISO , MCC13 , and MaTi are negative for MCV infection ( nonspeciﬁc 60 - kDa and 75 - kDa bands are also detected by CM2B4 and CM8E6 , respectively ) . LT sizes differ among MCC cell lines and also differ from the size of full - length LT206 expressed in 293 cells , consistent with different carboxyl truncation mutations in different MCV - positive cell lines . Tubulin expression was determined as a protein loading control . FIG . 3 . Knockdown of T - antigen expression using green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - expressing and puromycin - selectable lentiviral shRNA vectors . Total - cell lysates were analyzed for LT ( open arrowhead ) and sT ( ﬁlled arrowhead ) expression by immunoblotting using antibody CM8E6 . ( A ) The indicated MCC cell lines were infected with the lentiviral shRNA vector KH1 , encoding GFP and either a shRNA targeting all MCV TA mRNAs ( TA . GFP ) or a scrambled shRNA ( Sc . GFP ) . The infection rates in this particular experiment were determined to be 79 % ( MKL - 1 TA . GFP ) , 91 % ( WaGa TA . GFP ) , and 81 % ( BroLi TA . GFP ) . Knockdown was examined at day 5 postinfection . ( B ) The indicated MCC cell lines were infected with the lentiviral shRNA vector pLKO , encoding puromycin resistance and either a shRNA targeting all MCV TA mRNAs ( T1 . puro and T2 . puro ) or a scrambled shRNA ( Sc . puro ) . To eliminate uninfected cells , puromycin ( 1 (cid:4) g / ml ) was added to the culture medium at day 2 after infection , and infected cells were selected for 4 days . Knockdown was examined at day 6 postinfection for MKL - 1 , MKL - 2 , and MS - 1 cells and at day 10 for WaGa cells .

On day 7 after infection with shTA . GFP , TA knockdown in GFP - positive MKL - 1 and BroLi cells was associated with a small but distinct fraction of cells ( 6 % ) displaying early apoptotic features ( 7 - AAD (cid:6) annexin V (cid:7) cells ) ( Fig . 5A ) . For WaGa cells , we did not observe a signif - icant increase in 7 - AAD (cid:6) annexin V (cid:7) early apoptotic cells upon T - antigen knockdown ( Fig . 5A ) . To study the involve - ment of apoptosis , we examined caspase activation . shTA . GFP - induced TA knockdown did not increase the cleav - age of PARP , caspase - 3 , or caspase - 9 ( Fig . 5B ) . As a control , cleaved forms of caspases as well as PARP protein were gen - erated after doxorubicin treatment , indicating intact caspase - initiated apoptotic pathways in MCC cells ( Fig . 5B ) . Compa - rable results were obtained by analysis of shT1 . puro - infected MCC cells ( data not shown ) . All MCC cell lines are characterized by a prominent cell fraction in G 0 / G 1 ( e . g . , 85 % of MKL - 1 cells , 83 % of WaGa cells , and 88 % of BroLi cells ) under standard cell culture conditions . Subsequent to shTA . GFP knockdown , but not after infection with the shSc . GFP control construct , the numbers of WaGa cells in S and G 2 / M are reduced ( Fig . 6A and B ) , an effect that is present but less pronounced for MKL - 1 and BroLi cells ( Fig . 6A ) . Accumulation of cells in G 1 is also observed upon TA knockdown by infection of MKL - 1 , WaGa , MKL - 2 , and MS - 1 cells with shT1 . puro ( Fig . 6C and data not shown ) . Moreover , decreased BrdU label - ing of these cells is indicative of reduced S - phase entry from G 0 / G1 . ( Fig . 6C ) .

GFP ) ; infected cells show green ﬂuorescence . To examine altered growth properties upon TA knockdown , the infected , green ﬂuorescent cells were mixed with uninfected , nonﬂuorescent cells on day 1 postinfection ; subsequently , changes in the ratio of green ﬂuorescent to nonﬂuorescent cells were measured over time . The ratios on day 4 were set to 1 . The upper row shows results for MCV - positive cell lines ( MKL - 1 , WaGa , BroLi , MKL - 2 , and MS - 1 ) , and the lower row shows those for MCV - negative cell lines ( MCC13 , MaTi , UISO , FM88 , and Jurkat ) . Each graph represents mean values ( (cid:8) standard deviations ) for at least three independent experiments . The exact number of independent experiments is indicated . ( B ) The indicated cell lines were infected with the lentiviral shRNA vector pLKO , encoding puromycin and either a shRNA targeting all MCV TA mRNAs ( T1 . puro and T2 . puro ) or a scrambled shRNA ( Sc . puro ) . At 48 h after infection , 2 . 5 (cid:5) 10 4 infected MCV - positive cells ( MKL - 1 , MKL - 2 , and MS - 1 ) and 10 4 infected MCV - negative UISO cells were seeded , and growth was monitored over time in the presence of puromycin ( 1 (cid:4) g / ml ) . For the WaGa cell line , 2 . 5 (cid:5) 10 4 cells were seeded at day 8 postinfection after puromycin selection . The growth properties of the shRNA infected cells were measured by the Wst - 1 assay . 7068 HOUBEN ET AL . J .

Modest increases in Bcl - xL and Bax levels were observed upon TA knockdown in MKL - 1 cells ( Fig . 7A and B ) ; however , this observation was not consistent with those for other cell lines analyzed ( Fig . 7C ) . p53 protein was detected in all MCC cell lines except MKL - 2 . While p53 protein levels were mar - ginally decreased in the MCV - positive cell lines MKL - 1 , MS - 1 , and WaGa after TA knockdown , we did not observe speciﬁc stabilization or activation of p53 , suggesting that the p53 path - way is unlikely to cause the observed TA knockdown - induced growth inhibition or cell death ( Fig . 7D ) . Finally , protein ex - pression of Bcl - 2 , Mcl - 1 , Bad , Bik , Bim , and Puma was not altered in MKL - 1 cells after TA knockdown with shT1 . puro or shT2 . puro . DISCUSSION Approximately 20 % of human cancers worldwide have been linked to infection ( 28 ) . MCV as a new cause for human cancer is particularly difﬁcult to establish because ( i ) MCC is relatively rare ( 5 ) , ( ii ) MCV infection is near - ubiquitous among adults ( 10 , 23 , 29 , 42 ) , and ( iii ) not all MCC tumors are infected with the virus ( 4 , 14 , 15 , 21 , 41 ) . Nonetheless , direct detection of viral proteins is strictly associated with and speciﬁc for MCC tumors ( 39 ) . While MCV infection is widespread , MCV - posi - tive MCC patients have markedly higher titers of antibody to late viral antigens than MCV - negative MCC patients , consis - tent with persistent antigen stimulation ( 29 , 42 ) . Finally , clonal MCV integration and the presence of speciﬁc TA mutations for tumor - derived MCV provide unambiguous evidence that MCV was present prior to tumor cell genesis and that the virus is not an incidental or passenger infection ( 14 , 37 ) . Analysis of MCC tumors revealed a strong selective pressure within tumors to silence independent DNA replication from the integrated viral genomes in MCC cancer cells . MCV LT encodes carboxyl - terminal origin - binding and helicase do - mains that are required for viral DNA replication ( 25 , 31 ) , but most MCC - derived MCV LT DNA sequences harbor stop codon mutations truncating these domains ( 40 ) . These tumor - speciﬁc mutations do not affect amino - terminal Rb1 interac - tion and DnaJ domains , although they may eliminate a puta - tive p53 - binding domain . The MCV sT protein , encoded by an alternative reading frame 5 (cid:3) to the hypermutable LT region , remains unaffected by tumor - speciﬁc mutations . The observational evidence for MCV causality in MCC is directly supported by the experimental studies presented . By means of shRNA knockdown , we demonstrate that MCV - positive MCC cell lines are “addicted” to expression of the viral TAs . We achieved efﬁcient TA knockdown in ﬁve differ - ent MCV - positive MCC cell lines , using three different exon 1 target sequences and two independent selection methods in order to rule out off - target effects or artifacts due to the method used . In each case , MCV - positive cells initiated growth arrest and / or underwent cell death with the TA exon 1 - speciﬁc vectors but not with scrambled shRNA vectors . MCV - negative cell lines , however , were unaffected by MCV TA - targeting shRNA , further indicating that this is not likely to be an off - target effect . These results show that MCV TA is required for MCC cell survival among those tumors infected with the virus . Since exon 1 is common to all TA isoforms , all early MCV transcripts were inhibited in our study . Dissecting the contri - butions of each TA isoform ( e . g . , LT , sT , and 57kT ) to the transformed MCC phenotype will be important for future in - vestigations . The dependency of the transformed phenotype on the ex - pression of TAs has been shown to be time dependent . In transgenic mice with inducible expression of SV40 TAs in the submandibular gland , hyperplasia was reversed upon the si - lencing of TA expression after 4 months but persisted when expression was shut down after 7 months ( 12 ) . Similarly , ade - novirus - transformed hamster cells have been reported to lose the previously integrated transforming viral DNA while retain - ing the oncogenic phenotype ( 30 ) . It is conceivable that such a phenomenon may also apply to some of the MCV - negative cases of MCC ; however , for MCV - positive cell lines , we show clear dependence on MCV TA expression . Since cell death induced by TA knockdown is not associated with caspase activation , PARP cleavage , major shifts in phos - phatidylserine location , or alterations in p53 or Bcl - 2 family protein expression , it lacks important features of classical apoptosis . Alternatively , cell death may occur through auto - phagy , a process of cellular self - degradation involving the ly - sosomal machinery that has recently attracted increasing at - tention in cancer research ( 6 ) . Necrosis , a process distinct from FIG . 5 . Induction of cell death but lack of caspase activation upon T - antigen knockdown . The indicated MCC cells were infected with the indicated lentiviral constructs expressing either a shRNA targeting all MCV TA mRNAs ( TA . GFP ) or a scrambled shRNA ( Sc . GFP ) . ( A ) Cells were subjected to double staining with annexin V and 7 - AAD on day 7 postinfection ; to restrict measurements to living , infected cells , only green ﬂuorescent cells were analyzed . The early apoptotic cells are identiﬁed as the 7 - AAD (cid:6) annexin V (cid:7) cells . Each bar repre - sents the mean value ( (cid:7) standard error ) for the indicated number of independent experiments . Statistical analysis was done using the Mann - Whitney test ( (cid:1) , P (cid:9) 0 . 05 ; (cid:1)(cid:1) , P (cid:9) 0 . 005 ) . ( B ) Immunoblot analysis for cleaved PARP , caspase 9 , and caspase 3 proteins in total - cell lysates from the indicated cells on day 5 post - shRNA infection . The induction of cleaved PARP and caspase proteins after a 16 - h doxorubicin ( 1 . 0 (cid:4) M ) treatment demonstrates that functional apop - totic pathways remain intact in these cell lines .

The observed cell cycle arrest upon T - antigen knockdown can be more directly explained by alter - ations of the Rb – E2F pathway : Rb family proteins are the master regulators of S - phase entry , and they are the prominent cellular targets for polyomavirus T antigens ( 13 , 45 ) . Despite the fact that MCV was discovered only recently , both observational data and the experimental studies described FIG . 6 . Decreased cell cycle progression upon T - antigen knockdown in MCV - positive MCC cells . ( A ) Cells were infected with the indicated lentiviral constructs expressing either a shRNA targeting all MCV TA mRNAs ( TA . GFP ) or a scrambled shRNA ( Sc . GFP ) . The cellular DNA content was determined by PI staining of ﬁxed cells . The percentage of cells with (cid:10) 2N DNA content on day 7 following infection with Sc . GFP or TA . GFP is given . Each bar represents the mean value ( (cid:7) standard error ) for the indicated number of independent experiments . Statistical analysis was done using the Mann - Whitney test ( (cid:1) , P (cid:9) 0 . 05 ) .

Note the large sub - G 1 fraction that is also visible in the histogram blots of Sc . GFP - infected cells . The percentages of cells in the S and G 2 phases of the cell cycle were estimated in histogram blots after exclusion of the doublets and sub - G 1 cells . ( C ) MKL - 1 or WaGa cells infected with Sc . puro or T1 . puro were labeled with 10 (cid:4) M BrdU fo r 3 h at day 8postinfection .

While polyomaviruses have been studied exten - sively in animal cancer models , MCV is the ﬁrst polyomavirus for which strong evidence supports a causal role in human cancer ( 32 ) . Identifying speciﬁc cellular pathways targeted by putative MCV TA oncoproteins can lead directly to new , more effective , and less toxic therapies for this human cancer .
