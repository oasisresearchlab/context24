Interactive ap - proaches using only visual feedback are limited to the 2D image of the microscope , and have forcibly lower bandwidth . Recently , haptic feedback teleoperation systems have been developed to try to overcome those difﬁculties . This paper explores the case of an optical tweezers platform coupled to an haptic device providing transparent force feedback . The impact of haptic feedback regarding user dexterity on tactile exploration tasks is studied using 3 µm microbeads and a test bench with micro sized shapes . The results reveal a consistent improvement in both users’ trajectory tracking and their control of the contact forces . This also validates the experimental setup which performed reliably on 140 different trials of the evaluation . I . I NTRODUCTION Interactive micromanipulation has gained much attention due to a wide range novel of applications such as biological cell manipulation , drug delivery and microassembly . Among current techniques , Optical Tweezers ( OT ) is suitable for the manipulation of synthetic and biological samples ranging from a hundred of nanometres to tenth of millimeters , in a conﬁned environment such as microﬂuidic devices . Optical tweezers uses the pressure of light radiation to trap an object by providing a steep potential well in all axes , generated by the balance between the gradient forces on the optical plane ( x , y ) and the scattering force in the normal direction ( z ) . This is usually obtained with a highly focused laser beam [ 1 ] . Controlling multiple focal spots enables to simultaneously trap and manipulate several objects in 3D [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . Optical manipulation has been applied to a large range of applications such as cell rotation [ 4 ] , microassembly [ 5 ] and the actuation of mobile microrobots [ 6 ] . Furthermore , optical forces on trapped spherical objects can be modelled linearly , as the restoring optical force is proportional to the distance from its equilibrium position . This particularity has led to the use of optical trapping for quantitative force measurements [ 7 ] , such as the strength of inter - molecular bonds [ 8 ] or the stiffness of a cell mem - brane [ 9 ] . The optical trap acts as a spring with a stiffness proportional to the light intensity [ 10 ] . Well - established methods exist for precise stiffness calibration [ 11 ] . Hence , * This work was supported by the French National Research Agency through the ANR - IOTA project ( ANR - 16 - CE33 - 0002 - 01 ) , and partially by the French government research program ”Investissements d’avenir” through the Robotex Equipment of Excellence ( ANR - 10 - EQPX - 44 ) . 1 Authors are with Sorbonne Universit ´ e , CNRS , Institut des Syst ` emes Intelligents et de Robotique , ISIR , F - 75005 Paris , France . 2 Y .

( Correspondence e - mail : edison . gerena @ isir . upmc . fr ) force sensing directly stems from the capability to track the position of the trapped object . The position detection is commonly obtained through opti - cal means , for example by a quadrant photodiode ( QPD ) [ 12 ] or digital cameras [ 13 ] . Photo - detection based techniques have high precision and high - bandwidth . However , they are not suitable for micromanipulations tasks , as they are very vulnerable to occlusions and environmental disturbances . Vi - sual tracking algorithms using CMOS cameras offer straight - forward implementations , but their bandwidth is limited by the amount of data that should be transmitted and processed . Real - time force information is hardly available . To overcome this issue , a tracking technique using an event - based camera is demonstrated [ 14 ] , providing 3D force measurements in real - time . Due to the difﬁculty to access the force sensing , there are only few works implementing a closed force control loop for optical manipulation . Most approaches are open - loop techniques [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , or automated one based on position [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] . However , in optical tweezers , objects are stably trapped up to a force threshold . This threshold is easily reached in most cases , for example by drag forces occurring during manipulation , ejecting the trapped object . Also , handling physical contact and interactions in terms of force is a key capability in robot control [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . Hence , force control approach implies immediate beneﬁts in robotic optical tweezers . Moreover , forces in the environment are important sources of information to complement the visual feedback and allow estimating physical characteristics such as stiffness or surface condition . As in macroscale , it is expected that user dexterity and precision would improve by enriching their perception . Consequently , several force sensors have been developed [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , and various haptic - feedback teleoperated systems dedicated to micromanipulation have been proposed [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . Direct coupling between the macro and microenvi - ronments arise several control issues . High scaling factors ( from picoNewton to Newton ) amplify the signal noise and other measured signals as Brownian motion , reducing system stability and operator’s understanding . Concerning optical manipulation , Arai et al . [ 27 ] have proposed the ﬁrst haptic coupling for optical tweezers . 2D haptic explorations of microsurfaces have been demonstrated [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] . 2D Multi - trap bilateral teleoperation of optical tweezers has also been proposed [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] . Recently , a proof of concept of the ﬁrst 3D haptic optical tweezers system was demonstrated [ 14 ] . These prototypes of haptic optical tweezers allow conduct - ing micromanipulation tasks in a more ﬂexible and intuitive 2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation ( ICRA ) 31 May - 31 August , 2020 . Paris , France 978 - 1 - 7281 - 7395 - 5 / 20 / $ 31 . 00 ©2020 IEEE 10292 way . However , in these works experiments are generally done by their creators , albeit potential end - users are not roboticists , but lab technicians who expect a turn - key system . Some works studied the usefulness of haptic feedbacks combined with optical tweezers . Lee et al . [ 32 ] proposed a model to simulate force interactions between a particle and a laser beam for haptic manipulation of microparticles , but their work is purely theoretical . Artiﬁcial guides and force - ﬁelds are explored to help the operator steer the trapped particle , avoiding collisions and contacts with other particles [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] . However , these experiments use virtual forces to improve the manipulation efﬁciency of optical tweezers systems . No study has evaluated a direct bilateral coupling with naive users . We report here a systematic study on a bilaterally cou - pled haptic teleoperation on optical tweezers , providing real - time force sensing and straightforward human / machine interaction . We conduct haptic exploration experiments of microsynthetic objects with 14 subjects , resulting in 280 micromanipulation trials , comparing performances with and without force - feedback couplings . The use of synthetic ob - jects helps the repeatability of the experiments and provides a ground truth for the shapes explored . The results indicate that haptic feedback improves the operator’s dexterity in practical micromanipulation tasks , and improves by 35 % the success rate in exploration tasks . II . M ETHODS A . Haptic Optical Tweezers Platform A versatile optical manipulation system ( see Fig . 1 ) with 3D haptic feedback was designed to offer robust and intuitive control of suspended microbeads . Note that human sense of touch functions over a signiﬁcant band of frequencies reach - ing 500 Hz . Double this value is considered a requirement for the control bandwidth to maintaining stability and a quality perception . The latency should not exceed 2 or 3 sampling periods [ 36 ] . This particular setup provides 3D high - speed and high resolution force sensor , deployed in hard real - time to guarantee 1 kHz control - loop frequency . 1 ) Optical Tweezers : The custom optical tweezers uses a 1064nm laser source ( working power output : 300 mW ) . The laser source is directed into an oil immersion objective ( Olympus UPlanFLN 40x , NA 1 . 3 ) creating a ﬁxed optical trap in the focus plane . The sample - holder is mounted on redundant motion stages , hence controlling the 3D position of the sample - chamber in a large workspace , while the optical trap and the trapped object remains ﬁxed in the optical plan . Two 2D microstages ( PI , M126 . CG ) and a 3D motorized nanostage ( PI , P562 . 3CD ) are used for planar coarse positioning and x - y - z ﬁne positioning respectively . The illumination ( LED , 3W ) goes through the same objective and is divided by a beam splitter to two cameras : a conventional CMOS camera ( Basler 659 × 494 px ) and the asynchronous event - based image sensor ( ATIS ) .

( c ) Slave device and optical path . 10293 provides the environment and visual feedback to operators , while the latter is used to infer force information . 2 ) 3D High - speed Force Sensing : The force applied to the bead is computed using the optical force model [ 10 ] : F opt = K × ( P laser − P bead ) ( 1 ) where ( P laser − P bead ) is the difference between the fo - cus point of the optical trap and the bead position . K is the stiffness and was estimated experimentally using the Equipartition method [ 11 ] as K x = 12 . 3 pN / µ m , K y = 12 . 6 pN / µ m and K z = 1 . 5 pN / µ m for 300 mW laser power . As the optical trap remains ﬁxed in the optical plan , the only unknown is the actual bead position . The trapped bead’s motion is measured using an event - based camera ( ATIS from Prophesee , 240 × 304 px ) . In this sensor , each pixel responds asynchronously and independently to light intensity variations above a threshold , just like the spikes in human retina . Thereby , the system captures only the dynamic information and the amount of data to be processed is therefore considerably reduced , which makes it possible to process at speeds up to 10k fps [ 37 ] . A tracking algorithm is specially crafted for this sensor to extract the trapped objects’ motion [ 14 ] . For a 3 µ m microbead , the force detection range is 36 . 9 , 37 . 8 and 4 . 5 pN for x , y and z respectively , with a planar theoretical resolution of 0 . 3 pN and an axial resolution of 0 . 25 pN . Please note that the Brownian motion’s amplitude is approximately ten times higher than those resolution values for the given bead .

( b ) Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) image of the microchip . 3 ) Bilateral Coupling : A direct bilateral coupling has been implemented , where the master position drives the trap position , and sensed forces are sent to the haptic device with linear scaling factors [ 36 ] . Although this approach gives the best transparency , the ampliﬁcation of high - frequency noise degrades user perception . A dissipation block is hence inserted by virtually damping the force signal sent to the user . This is equivalent to a simple low - pass ﬁlter . Users control the 3D position of the haptic interface ( Omega . 7 , ForceDimension ) . Then , these translations are scaled down by G p . xy = 1 . 5 × 10 − 4 and G pz = 0 . 9 × 10 − 4 and sent to the nanostage to control the trap position relatively to sample holder . Finally , estimated forces are scaled up by G f . xy = 0 . 3 × 10 12 and G fz = 1 . 2 × 10 12 and send to the master device . The position scaling factors are chosen as to cover 40 × 40 × 20 µ m 3 in the optical tweezers workspace . Scaling factors in force are empirically chosen for a subjectively optimum tactile perception . The entire solution is deployed on a hard real - time frame - work ( co - kernel , Xenomai ) to guarantee 1 kHz control - loop rate . The proposed direct coupling provides very good transparency as the force signal sent to the haptic device is a linear function of the sensor output . Fig . 3 depicts both these signals during a manipulation . A slight difference appears due to the virtual dissipation and the mechanical response of the haptic device . B . Micro - chip Test bench To evaluate the utility of haptic feedback in micromanipu - lation experiments and to ensure the repeatability of the task , a test bench has been manufactured .

( b ) The 2D trajectory of the microbead during the triangle surface exploration . 10294 containing different basic shapes ranging in size from 7 µ m to 14 µ m . The chip was printed using two - photon lithography with a Nanoscribe Photonic professional GT ( Nanoscribe GmbH , Germany ) . The 63x objective and IP - Dip photoresist were used for printing to achieve the highest resolution ( < 1 µ m ) when writing 3D microstructure . After the completion of the printing , the wafer was submerged in PGMEA for 40 minutes and then in Isopropanol ( IPA ) for 30 minutes . After that , the IPA was removed by simply letting it evaporate in a clean room . The entire chip body has been designed to the millimeter scale , so that it can be simply manipulated with forceps . During an exploration task , the chip is placed in a Petri dish ﬁlled with a solution composed of 90 % distilled water , 5 % ethanol and 5 % Tween20 to prevent surface adhesions . It is oriented in a way that the columns with the micrometer size shapes come into contact with the cover - slip . Then , the microbeads are added from a solution using a micropipette . After each trial , the chip is washed with distilled water and IPA until evaporation . III . E XPERIMENTAL P ROTOCOL The goal of the experiment is to analyse the performance of the subjects in an exploration task with and without haptic feedback . A . Participant The set of 14 volunteers were from Sorbonne Universit´e . The age range were from 20 to 30 years old . The accepted volunteers were all right handed and did not present any physical abnormality . B . Tasks performed The task is to explore edges of different shapes using a op - tically trapped microbead of 3 µ m diameter . The participant needed to ﬁrst establish contact between the microbead and the explored shape , then follow the edges of the shape while maintaining contact until a complete tour around the shape is done . If for any reason the microbead is ejected from the optical trap , the task ends and is logged as ’failed’ . The bead ejection can typically be caused by an abrupt movement or an excessive pressure on the explored shape . The complete set of tasks contains two exploration at - tempts of ﬁve different shapes located on the microﬂuidic chip . The ﬁve shapes are a square , a trapeze , a triangle , a half - circle and a cross . Participants were divided in two groups of equal number . A ﬁrst group of 7 participants performs ﬁrst the set of tasks with only visual feedback ( V ) , then the set of tasks with visual feedback and haptic feedback ( V + H ) . A second group of 7 participants performs the set of tasks with visual feedback and haptic feedback ( V + H ) ﬁrst , then the set of tasks with only visual feedback ( V ) . Consequently , each participant performs 10 exploration tasks with visual feedback ( V ) and 10 with dual feedback ( V + H ) , therefore a total of 140 trials were performed for each condition .

Results are normalized to facilitate the comparison . 10295 C . Conduct of the experiment The experiments were conducted one participant at a time and each trial lasted around 30 minutes , depending on the participant’s performance . Before the formal evaluation , the participants were trained to use the system for 10 minutes and shown how to manipulate microbeads ( 3 µ m , polystyrene ) with the help of the haptic interface . An expert user traps a microbead , approaches the different shapes to explore , and constraints the z axis motion , then hands the control to the participant . This way the experiment is dissociated from the trapping phase and focuses on the feedback during execution . IV . R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION In order to evaluate the performances of the subjects , the position of the nanostage and the estimated force applied on the microbead are recorded at a rate of 500Hz during the complete duration of each task . After the experiments , the maximum , the mean and the standard deviation are extracted from the norms of the recorded forces for every task . Those force results are then used to compute the desired average maximum , average mean and average standard deviation displayed in Fig . 5 , Fig . 6 and Fig . 7 . In addition , the task is written as failed if the participant loses the trapped microbead , and its data is used for the calculation of success rates shown in Fig . 5 , Fig . 6 and Fig . 7 . Finally , the duration of each task is stored to evaluate the timing aspect of the participants performances . A . Results per participant Fig . 4 shows examples of exploration results in both condition ( V ) and ( V + H ) for the trapeze , the half - circle and the cross . Fig3 . ( a ) and ( b ) show the path followed and the contact forces applied on the microbead during the con - tour exploration . Note that the forces are never completely null as a consequence of the Brownian motion applying constantly an erratic force on the bead , which is one of the important differences between macro - manipulation and micro - manipulation . In A , the participant did not lose the microbead and complete the trapeze exploration task in both conditions ( V ) and ( V + H ) . However , the representation of the forces shows a far more irregular pattern in condition ( V ) than in ( V + H ) . The trajectory around the shape shown in Fig . 4 . ( c ) reveals a more accurate tracking of the outline of the shapes when the haptic feedback is enabled . With vision only , the participant tends to move away from the shape or to apply excessive forces risking the loss of the microbead . In B and C , the participant loses the microbead in condition ( V ) , but not in ( V + H ) . A force spike can be seen near the end point when the bead was lost in ( a ) of B and C . The distribution of the forces displayed in Fig . 4 . ( d ) present a Gaussian shape in the condition ( V + H ) , in contrast to the ( V ) case centered at 0pN with a decreasing slope . During the exploration in the condition ( V + H ) , the participants exhibit a relatively constant force , relying obviously more on the haptic feedback than on vision for Vision Force + Vision ( a ) ( c ) Maximum force [ pN ] 05 10 15202530 1 Force variability [ pN ] 0 2 4 6 8 Successful trials Mean force [ pN ] 0 2 4 6 8 ( b ) ( d ) 10 11 12 13 14 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 80 % 100 % 60 % 40 % 20 % 0 % 1 10 11 12 13 14 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 10 11 12 13 14 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 10 11 12 13 14 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Subject Subject Subject Subject Fig . 5 . Statistical results of the experiment per subject . the ﬁne movements . Without force information in the ( V ) condition , the participants were trying to interpret the visual feedback to evaluate the force applied , resulting in a more demanding situation hence less accurate movements . In the condition ( V + H ) , the haptic information naturally integrates with the vision to achieve ﬁner motor - control . Fig . 5 depicts the force analysis and success rate for an individual subject . The most obvious result is the low rate of failed trials when haptic is used , as shown in Fig . 5 . ( d ) . It is effectively quite difﬁcult to visually evaluate when the microbead risks to be ejected . The force feedback marks the difference by providing this critical information . The effect is also visible in the maximum force graph in Fig . 5 . ( a ) which shows a decrease of the maximum force exerted , meaning that the participant manages the contact better , releasing pressure on the explored object when needed . We also observe for 13 out of 14 participants a decrease in the mean force exerted between ( V ) and ( V + H ) ( Fig . 5 ) , attesting that participants proceed more gently when the haptic feedback is enabled . The force variability shown in Fig . 5 . ( c ) has dropped for every subject between ( V ) and ( V + H ) , reﬂecting the previous observation on the force’s distribution displayed in Fig . 4 . ( d ) . The participants naturally attempt to keep a constant force during the exploration in condition ( V + H ) , which diminish the variability of the exerted forces . No meaningful differences are observed in the individual results between the group starting with ( V ) and the group starting with ( V + H ) . This absence of dissimilarity tends to demonstrate that no additional training is necessary to handle the haptic feedback . If a period of familiarization were needed , the participant starting with ( V ) would have per - formed better in ( V + H ) than the participant starting directly with ( V + H ) because they would have already completed 10 exploration tasks and substantially progressed in optical - manipulation .

Statistical results of the experiment for each shape . successful trials are counted in the computation of the time of exploration . A small decrease of duration is observed for each shape between ( V ) and ( V + H ) . Since no instructions were given to go fast , it indicates that the participants tend to naturally proceed slightly better with the haptic feedback in condition ( V + H ) . An expected inverse correlation appears between the duration of the task and the success rate . The most complex shape is the cross by the number of sharp corners . It has a longer duration of exploration and a lower successful trial rate , while a simpler shape like the triangle shows shorter duration of exploration and a higher success rate . This success rate could be not only related to the duration of the task , but also by the number of corners ( triangle and cross have 3 and 12 corners respectively ) . Further studies are necessary , such as the exploration of the same shape but with different sizes . C . General results In Fig . 7 are displayed global results representing the average data of all participants over all shapes . Between ( V ) and ( V + H ) , the average maximum force decreases by 46 . 0 % ( 6 . 70pN ) and the average force drops by 40 . 4 % ( 1 . 45pN ) . The force variability drops by 55 . 7 % ( 1 . 87pN ) . Finally , the global successful trials rate rises by 35 % from 61 % to 96 % , meaning that the fail rate is divided by almost 10 from 39 % in ( V ) to 4 % in ( V + H ) . To perform optical - micromanipulations , visual feedbacks are suffering from two major issues . First , the broadcasted image is a 2D projection of a 3D workspace . The operator faces difﬁculties to apprehend the working environment and a mental effort is required to grasp a clear 3D representation of the ongoing manipulation . Secondly , an objective with high numerical aperture is necessary to create an optical tweezer . The focused region of the resulting image is narrow and generates visual artefacts around the observed micro - Vision Force + Vision 14 . 58 7 . 88 0 5 10 15 20 Maximumforce [ pN ] Mean force [ pN ] Force variability [ pN ] Successful trials 61 % 96 % ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 3 . 59 2 . 14 3 . 36 1 . 49 0 1 2 3 4 5 80 % 100 % 60 % 40 % 20 % 0 % Fig . 7 . Statistical global results of the experiment . structures . Those two aspects compromise the user’s vision and thus his performances . In addition , the forces generated by an optical tweezer are weak and a trapped micro - object can easily be ejected by a collision or an abrupt movement . The deployed haptic feedback system complements the visual feedback with 3D forces information . Therefore , it helps in the 3D apprehension of the workspace and in the perception of the forces exerted by the optical tweezer on the trapped microbead . V . C ONCLUSION This study demonstrates that haptic feedback improves the user performance in optical manipulation by a signiﬁcant margin . Vision provides general overview information on the scene and haptic feedback is used for ﬁne control when contacting or manipulating an object . The operator naturally integrates this additional information channel . Participants apply in average less pressure on the manipulated objects , their handling is smoother and contact forces exhibit far less variance . The decrease in the execution duration let also assume a better mental efﬁciency , correlated to a lesser cognitive load , which indicates that the user considers the task easier [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] . Therefore , proposed multimodal stimuli enables users to better apprehend microscale phenomenons and be more effective to achieve desired results during manipulation tasks . Additionally , the 3D force complements the 2D vision infor - mation delivered by the microscope and allows users to react faster , as human haptic perception bandwidth is one order of magnitude higher than vision . This also gives a far richer information : for example changes in high - frequencies of the Brownian motion which would go unnoticed for the eyes becomes perceivable with haptics . As an additional last remark , the system used in experi - ments also proved itself repeatable and reliable . The coupling is highly transparent , and no instability occurred on any of the 140 trials . As future works , we plan to study the impact of the optical trap stiffness ( by varying the laser power ) and the gain values on the manipulation performance . As the trap stiffness increases , the range of applicable forces raise but the conditions to ensure the system’s stability becomes stricter . We also plan to further test the haptic optical coupling on different test benches with various materials . Specially , soft materials will be implemented to mimic biological samples ( e . g . cells and tissues ) and user studies will be performed with other manipulation tasks such as pick - and - place .
