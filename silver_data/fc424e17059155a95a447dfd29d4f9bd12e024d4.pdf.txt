Sechi § Actin polymerisation is thought to drive the movement of eukaryotic cells and some intracellular pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes . The Listeria surface protein ActA synergises with recruited host proteins to induce actin polymerisation , propelling the bacterium through the host cytoplasm [ 1 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex is one recruited host factor [ 2 , 3 ] ; it is also believed to regulate actin dynamics in lamellipodia [ 4 , 5 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex promotes actin filament nucleation in vitro , which is further enhanced by ActA [ 6 , 7 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex also interacts with members of the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) [ 8 ] family — Scar1 [ 9 , 10 ] and WASP itself [ 11 ] . We interfered with the targeting of the Arp2 / 3 complex to Listeria by using carboxy - terminal fragments of Scar1 that bind the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 11 ] . These fragments completely blocked actin tail formation and motility of Listeria , both in mouse brain extract and in Ptk2 cells overexpressing Scar1 constructs . In both systems , Listeria could initiate actin cloud formation , but tail formation was blocked . Full motility in vitro was restored by adding purified Arp2 / 3 complex . We conclude that the Arp2 / 3 complex is a host - cell factor essential for the actin - based motility of L . monocytogenes , suggesting that it plays a pivotal role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton .

In contrast , the Scar - W fragment , which only binds G - actin [ 11 ] ( Figure 1a ) , had no effect on tail forma - tion and motility even at 5 m M ( data not shown ) . At concen - trations up to 0 . 5 m M ( Figure 1b ; see also Supplementary material ) , the fraction of bacteria with actin tails was approximately normal — about 80 % for Scar - A ( 274 bacte - ria analysed in 22 samples ) and Scar - WA ( 192 bacteria , 18 samples ) , as compared with 80 – 90 % for a control extract containing no Scar1 protein ( 100 bacteria , 11 samples ) or 5 . 0 m M Scar - W ( 109 bacteria , 7 samples ) . At and above 0 . 6 m M ( Figure 1b ) , however , both Scar - A ( 373 bacteria , 41 samples ) and Scar - WA ( 323 bacteria , 19 samples ) strongly inhibited tail formation . At concentrations of Scar - WA ( 151 bacteria , 8 samples ) or Scar - A ( 54 bacteria , 3 samples ) in excess of 0 . 6 m M , there was no detectable bacterial movement ( Figure 1b ) . In con - trast , Scar - W did not affect bacterial speeds ( data not shown ; see also Supplementary material ) , which were between 0 . 2 and 0 . 7 m m per minute for 2 . 0 m M Scar - W ( 23 bacteria , 4 samples ) ; these speeds are comparable to those seen with the control ( 0 . 4 – 0 . 7 m m per minute ; 20 bacteria , 3 samples ) . Given that the effects of Scar fragments on Listeria tail for - mation are likely to be due to a sequestration of the avail - able Arp2 / 3 complex in brain extract , we attempted to rescue the loss of tail formation by adding Arp2 / 3 complex purified from human neutrophils [ 12 ] to the brain extract . Listeria - induced tail formation was rescued by purified Arp2 / 3 complex in a concentration - dependent manner ( Figures 1c and 2c , g ) , suggesting that the inhibition of Lis - teria motility by Scar - A and Scar - WA was entirely due to interference with the available Arp2 / 3 complex . In agree - ment with this , Scar - A and Scar - WA had a similar inhibitory effect despite their differing abilities to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro [ 12 ] . Thus , inhibition was due only to sequestration of Arp2 / 3 complex , and not to any change in the activation state of the complex . Because Scar - A and Scar - WA had such profound effects on Listeria tail formation in vitro , we were interested to know whether the same effects occurred in vivo . Ptk2 cells expressing Scar - WA or full - length Scar1 showed peri - nuclear , diffuse filamentous actin ( F - actin ) staining and loss of lamellipodia and stress fibers ( Figure 3a , c ) , as pre - viously reported for Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and J774 macrophages [ 11 ] , indicating that both constructs delo - calise the Arp2 / 3 complex in Ptk2 cells . Scar - W , on the other hand , had no visible effect when expressed in cells , which retained a normal actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 3e ) . 760 Current Biology , Vol 9 No 14 Figure 2 Scar - WA inhibits tail formation by Listeria in a mouse brain extract .

( c , g ) Scar - WA ( 1 . 0 m M ) plus 1 . 0 m M purified Arp2 / 3 complex . Adding purified Arp2 / 3 complex restored motility to control levels . ( d , h ) Scar - WA ( 1 . 0 m M ) inhibited tail formation but not actin cloud formation ; 30 min after adding bacteria to extract pre - incubated with 1 m M Scar - WA , actin accumulation but no tail formation was observed . Note that the concentration of free actin in the extract preparation was high enough to support some spontaneous polymerisation , which led to the appearance of some short actin filaments , just visible in ( b ) . The scale bar represents 5 m m in each panel . For the motility assay , the following components were mixed in a tube : 4 m l cytosolic extract , 4 m l 0 . 5 % methylcellulose , 0 . 5 m l bacteria and 0 . 2 m l rhodamine - labelled G - actin ( Cytoskeleton , Colorado , USA ) . After a 30 min incubation at room temperature , an aliquot ( 1 . 7 m l ) of the mixture was squeezed between a glass coverslip and a microscope slide . To test the effect of Scar1 , the cytosolic extract was pre - incubated with varying concentrations of the different proteins for 30 min on ice . Speed measurements were performed using the image analysis software NIH - Image ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / nih - image ) .

( b ) Concentration dependence of tail inhibition . Increasing concentrations of Scar - A and Scar - WA protein reduced both the number of bacteria able to form tails and the speed of moving bacteria . There was a marked concentration dependence for both effects , with maximal inhibition at 0 . 6 m M for both Scar - A and Scar - WA . ( c ) The Arp2 / 3 complex restored Listeria motility . Adding purified Arp2 / 3 complex to extract containing 1 . 0 m M Scar - WA restored tail formation and motility in a concentration - dependent manner . Error bars are one standard deviation above and below the data point . Full - length Scar1 , and the Scar - WA , Scar - A and Scar - W proteins were produced as fusion products with glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) in Escherichia coli using the pGEX expression vector , as described previously [ 12 ] . In the case of Scar1 and Scar - WA , the GST moiety was subsequently removed by thrombin cleavage , leaving the intact protein . Scar - A and Scar - W were used without cleavage because of their small size . The Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from human neutrophils [ 12 ] .

Consequently , these bacteria were unable to spread within the cytoplasm of infected cells and often formed microcolonies . An identical result was observed for cells expressing full - length Scar1 ( Figure 3c , d ) , with intracellu - lar Listeria showing actin recruitment but no tail formation ( 0 tails out of 49 bacteria ) . In contrast , tail formation was normal ( 42 tails out of 97 bacteria ) in cells expressing Scar - W ( Figure 3e , f ) , and in non - transfected cells ( 53 tails out of 100 bacteria ) . The in vivo data agree with the results obtained in brain extract , suggesting that sequestration of the Arp2 / 3 complex by Scar1 prevents Listeria tail formation . This loss of motility in response to expression of full - length Scar1 or Scar - WA is distinct from that arising from the absence of ActA at the bacterial surface [ 13 , 14 ] . Mutant Listeria lacking the ActA protein did not assemble actin filaments ( Figure 3g , h ) , and consequently did not move . In contrast , Scar1 fragments inhibited actin tail formation much more potently than they inhibited actin cloud formation . Our observations may be explained in at least two ways . First , there may be a direct interaction between ActA and the Arp2 / 3 complex that is too strong to be disrupted by Scar1 . This would result in some recruitment of Arp2 / 3 complex , and thus actin cloud formation , but not enough Arp2 / 3 complex would be free to assemble tails . We did not detect any Arp2 / 3 complex on the surface of bacteria that formed clouds in the presence of Scar1 ( data not shown ) , but we cannot rule out the possibility of small amounts being present , especially as the expected ratio of complex to polymerised actin would be very low ( < 1 : 100 ) . If Arp2 / 3 complex binds ActA directly , it would be con - fined to the bacterial surface and could generate a cloud of pointed - end capped filaments . This possibility agrees with the observations of Welch et al . , who showed that Arp2 / 3 complex induced actin cloud formation on Listeria in a reconstituted system [ 6 ] . Subsequent tail assembly might require free Arp2 / 3 complex to promote further nucleation and cross - linking of filaments , in accordance with the ‘den - dritic nucleation’ model [ 15 ] . This later step would be blocked by exogenous Scar1 fragments . Alternatively , another host - cell factor , or ActA itself , may initiate cloud formation , with Arp2 / 3 complex being required only for Brief Communication 761 Figure 3 Scar1 domains that bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex prevent the formation of tails by intracellular Listeria . Ptk2 cells were transfected with ( a , b ) Scar - WA , ( c , d ) full - length Scar1 , or ( e , f ) Scar - W , and infected with Listeria wild - type strain EGD . F - actin is stained with Texas - Red – phalloidin . Arrows point to transfected cells ; the boxed portion in ( c , e ) is enlarged in ( d , f ) , respectively . Pseudocolouring in ( b ) shows transfected cells identified by anti - Myc antibodies in red . ( e , f ) Scar - W , which binds monomeric actin but not the Arp2 / 3 complex , had no effect on Listeria tail formation in vivo . Note that transfection of Scar1 and Scar - WA led to a complete inhibition of tail formation by intracellular Listeria , but did not prevent the initial recruitment of actin clouds . This is clearly different from the situation that occurs with ( g , h ) mutant bacteria lacking the ActA protein , which are unable to recruit any actin ; bacteria are visible in the phase contrast image ( h ) . The scale bar represents 5 m m in each panel . To detect cells expressing Scar1 or its derivatives , the monoclonal anti - Myc antibody 9E10 was used , followed by a CY2 - conjugated goat anti - mouse secondary antibody . Labelling of the actin cytoskeleton was carried out by adding phalloidin conjugated to Texas Red ( Molecular Probes ) . Coverslips were mounted in Prolong ( Molecular Probes ) . Images were recorded with a cooled back - illuminated CCD camera ( TE / CCD - 1000 TKB , Princeton Instruments ) driven by IPLab Spectrum software ( Scanalytics ) . Images were handled using Adobe Photoshop ( Adobe Systems ) . ( a ) ( e ) ( c ) ( b ) ( d ) ( f ) ( g ) ( h ) Current Biology 762 Current Biology , Vol 9 No 14 subsequent tail formation . This is supported by our obser - vation that actin clouds formed in the presence of 1 m M Scar - WA or 1 m M Scar - A , never developed into full tails ( Figure 2d ) . At present we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities . The WASP family of proteins ( which includes WASP , N - WASP and four Scar proteins ) are the most likely candi - dates to activate actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 12 , 16 ] . The amino terminus of ActA is essential for actin filament nucleation [ 17 , 18 ] , and this region is known to syn - ergise with the Arp2 / 3 complex to promote actin nucleation [ 7 ] . Similarly , Scar1 greatly increases the nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 12 ] . We believe that in eukaryotic cells , WASP family proteins can activate and probably also localise the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 11 , 16 ] , whereas in Listeria , ActA fulfils this role . In support of this model , sequences near to the Arp2 / 3 complex - binding site of Scar1 and WASP are also found in the amino terminus of ActA from L . mono - cytogenes and the related pathogen L . ivanovii ( Figure 4 ) . This region is essential for the actin - based motility of both species [ 17 – 19 ] . In addition , a recent report from Suzuki et al . [ 20 ] showed that N - WASP localised to actin tails of Shigella flexneri but not L . monocytogenes , suggesting that ActA may recruit and / or activate the Arp2 / 3 complex . In summary , we have demonstrated that the Arp2 / 3 complex is a host - cell factor essential for the actin - based motility of L . monocytogenes . We propose that the complex acts to nucleate and cross - link actin filaments during the tail - formation phase of this process .
