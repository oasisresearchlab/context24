The dynamics of actin cytoskeleton and its polymorphic nature are indispensable for the proper functioning of living cells . Actin bundles are involved in cell motility , environmental exploration , intracellular transport and mechanical stability . Though the viscoelastic properties of actin - based structures have been extensively probed , the underlying microstructure dynamics , especially their disas - sembly , is not fully understood . In this article , we explore the rich dynamics and emergent properties exhibited by actin bundles within flow - free confinements using a microfluidic set - up and epifluorescence microscopy . After forming entangled actin filaments within cell - sized quasi two - dimensional confinements , we induce their bundling using three different fundamental mechanisms : counterion condensation , depletion interactions and specific protein - protein interactions . Intriguingly , long actin filaments form emerging networks of actin bundles via percolation leading to remarkable properties such as stress generation and spindle - like intermediate structures . Simultaneous sharing of filaments in different links of the network is an important parameter , as short filaments do not form networks but segre - gated clusters of bundles instead . We encounter a hierarchical process of bundling and its subsequent disassembly . Additionally , our study suggests that such percolated networks are likely to exist within living cells in a dynamic fashion . These observations render a per - spective about differential cytoskeletal responses towards numerous stimuli . Introduction The mechanical integrity of a cell is orchestrated by the cytoskeleton , a dynamic system mainly comprised of filamentous actin ( F - actin ) , microtubules and intermediate filaments , aided by a plethora of accessory proteins . Actin , a dynamic and polymorphic component , forms a variety of structures such as filaments , bundles and their networks [ 1 ] . Bundling is a process in which two or more actin filaments join together along their longitudinal axes to form a thicker and more rigid rod - like structure known as a ‘ bundle ’ . Actin bundles are found in specialized struc - tures such as filopodia , bristles , microvilli , stereocilia [ 2 ] and in the growth cones of axons and PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0116521 March 18 , 2015 1 / 19 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Deshpande S , Pfohl T ( 2015 ) Real - Time Dynamics of Emerging Actin Networks in Cell - Mimicking Compartments .

Competing Interests : The authors have declared that no competing interests exist . dendrites [ 3 ] ; furthermore , they are abundant in plant cells [ 4 ] . The unique viscoelastic proper - ties shown by actin - based structures have been extensively probed by various means . This has yielded some major insights into their fundamental properties , such as the viscoelastic behavior of cross - linked and bundled networks using macrorheology [ 5 – 7 ] , differential mechanical re - sponse of actin bundles to forces using optical tweezers [ 8 ] , the control of bundle stiffness by actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) [ 9 ] , and the effect of cyclic shear on the networks [ 10 ] . Yet , the underlying microstructure dynamics that are responsible for these mechanical properties have received less attention , especially the disassembly of actin networks [ 11 ] . With this background , we aimed at studying in real time the evolution of actin microstructures in confined volumes in presence of various bundling agents . To study reversible reaction sequences ( assembly and disassembly ) in a step - by - step manner , one needs an open system . As a result , there have been relatively few studies in this direction , as most of the experimental systems are closed , such as sealed coverslips [ 6 , 12 ] , hermetically sealed chambers [ 13 ] , emulsion droplets [ 7 ] and liposomes [ 14 ] . Though actin filament dynam - ics in flow and confinements have been investigated [ 15 – 19 ] , the collective behavior of confined actin filaments in a stepwise manner is largely unexplored , which we aimed to address . Here , we present the dynamics of emerging networks of actin bundles using time - lapse epi - fluorescence microscopy with high spatiotemporal resolution . We studied actin networks formed by three different actin bundling agents known to have distinct bundling mechanisms : Mg 2 + ions causing counterion condensation ; polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) polymers leading to depletion interactions ; and filamin dimers specifically interacting with F - actin . We find a com - mon thread in the form of a hierarchical process where filaments fuse together to form ‘ small bundles ’ which further coalesce to form ‘ bigger bundles ’ , during network formation . The evolu - tion of reaction components guides us to the reaction kinetics and the involved mechanisms . Based on the data , we have built kinetic models to explain the observed actin dynamics . We have also performed local analyses to gain insights into intriguing phenomena , such as actin fil - ament zipping , stress generation and spindle - like structure formation , observed during the net - work formation within confined environments . Results In order to study the actin network dynamics , we created a straightforward microfluidic sys - tem , consisting of quasi two - dimensional ( h = 0 . 5 μ m ) , cell - sized circular compartments ( di - ameter d = 5 – 30 μ m ) , enclosing sub - picolitre volumes [ 20 ] . These ‘ microchambers ’ were connected to the controlling channel ( the reservoir ) via narrow connecting channels ( 0 . 5 μ m wide ) , enabling exclusive diffusive transport into and out of the microchambers ( Fig . 1a ) . Such a flow - free environment was ideal to form an entangled network of actin filaments in a steady - state , allowing further manipulation in a stepwise manner ( Fig . 1b , Materials and Methods ) . For all experiments , a semi - dilute ( 3 μ M ) actin solution was used , where the actin filaments overlapped and sterically hindered each other [ 21 ] . The mesh size or the average distance be - tween two filaments of these entangled networks of actin filaments , which depends on the actin concentration , corresponded to about 0 . 9 μ m [ 7 , 22 ] . The diffusion times of actin mono - mers and the bundling agents were low enough to allow homogenous distribution within the microchambers without affecting the bundling reaction rates ( S1 Fig . and S1 Text ) . Actin filament length dictates emerging actin networks Upon addition of bundling agents to the confined entangled actin filaments ( l avg = 56 . 7 μ m ± 19 . 1 μ m ) , a single network of actin bundles emerged instead of multiple isolated bundles ( S1 , S2 , S3 Videos ) . Representative examples of the network formation after the addition of Real - Time Dynamics of Emerging Actin Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0116521 March 18 , 2015 2 / 19 bundling agents are shown in Fig . 2 . Note that in each case , the confined actin filaments con - densed into a single network of bundles which freely fluctuated as a single entity . Actin bundles of various lengths and widths formed the ‘ links ’ of the networks , while the ‘ nodes ’ represented the junctions between two or more links ( bundles ) . Nevertheless , in the smallest confinements ( d = 5 μ m ) , a closed actin bundle ring formed ( S2 Fig . ) exhibiting the simplest network , i . e . , a single link without any nodes . Depletion of Mg 2 + ions and PEG polymers from the microcham - bers successfully lead to the disassembly of the networks back to the entangled actin filaments ( S4 , S5 Videos ) , thus proving the diffusion - controlled mechanism of the device . Filamin - in - duced networks , however , did not disassemble due to highly specific protein - protein interac - tions between filamin and F - actin ( S6 Video ) . Next , to test the effect of actin filament lengths on the network formation , we restricted the fil - ament length using an appropriate concentration of gelsolin [ 23 ] , an actin - severing and capping protein . There was no effect on actin network formation after restricting the length to 10 μ m . However , when the length was restricted to 1 μ m , it resulted in formation of isolated bundles ( re - ferred to as ‘ clusters ’ henceforth ) as opposed to a single network ( Fig . 3 , S7 , S8 , S9 Videos ) . Thus , in case of short filaments , there was a dramatic repression in the network formation . As in previ - ous experiments , depletion of the bundling agents led to the clusters disassembly ( S10 , S11 Vid - eos ) , excluding the case of filamin - induced networks ( S12 Video ) . In order to understand the effect of filament length on network formation / repression , we analyzed the nature of links and nodes . The average link length ( z ) of the emerged networks stayed almost constant ( (cid:1) 5 μ m ) for networks induced by each of the bundling agents , formed within different confinement sizes ( Fig . 4a ) . The long filaments ( l avg > z ) were easily shared between two or more links , aided by the close proximity of the entangled filaments . On the other hand , short filaments could not get shared between different links , preventing the formation of a single connected component . Thus , the filament length dictated the probability to get shared between two or more network links . The joining of different bundles to form a node was due to the simultaneous formation of bun - dles and the presence of shared filaments between them . Hence , sharing of filaments within dif - ferent bundles was a key factor and the main cause of the emerging networks . Thus , we found two distinct length regimes : short filaments , where a pure bundling process was observed , and long filaments where the bundling was accompanied by percolation , form - ing a single connected component . The two regimes could be clearly distinguished by analyzing the degree of nodes ( number of incident links on a specific node ) for the networks and the Fig 1 .

The scale bar represents 10 μ m . ( b ) In a step - by - step reaction sequence , the addition of bundling agents to a steady - state of actin filaments induces the bundling reaction resulting in a network of actin bundles while their subsequent depletion brings back the system to the original state of entangled filaments , in a diffusion - controlled manner . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0116521 . g001 Real - Time Dynamics of Emerging Actin Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0116521 March 18 , 2015 3 / 19 clusters in different confinements ( Fig . 4b ) . Networks exhibited an average degree of about three , except in the smallest confinements showing actin bundle rings , where the degree was zero . Clusters , on the other hand , possessed an average degree of about one , suggesting that the bundles were indeed separated from each other . Fig 2 .

This assumption was validated by analyzing the intensity profiles of bundles before and after fusing , where the sum of the fluorescence intensities of two smaller bundles matched up with the intensity of the bigger bundle that they ultimately formed ( S3 Fig . ) . We found that the intensity distributions showed several discernible peaks suggesting that bundles with a spe - cific number of filaments ( 3 – 4 , 7 – 8 , 12 , 16 ) were more stable than others ( S4 Fig . ) . Thus , fila - ments joined together to form small bundles which in turn fused to form bigger bundles , pointing towards a hierarchical bundling process . However , in case of clusters , no prominent intensity peaks were observed . To further assist the intensity profile - based analysis , we ana - lyzed the distribution of bundles with different filament densities within the networks and clus - ters . Distinct small and big bundles could be clearly seen in the emerging networks , while the segregation was less clear in the case of clusters ( S5 Fig . ) . To further understand the assembly dynamics , we studied the concentration changes of fila - ments and bundles over time , by plotting and analyzing the frequencies of greyscale values , corresponding to the fluorescence intensities . Fluorescence images of bundles showed in - creased occurrence of high greyscale values compared to single actin filaments ( insets in Fig . 5a ) . Fig . 5a displays several frequency histograms , where each histogram is a time point in the bundling process . As the bundling proceeds , high greyscale values corresponding to bun - dles are attained . With the aim to find possible ranges of greyscale values that represented a particular ele - ment , i . e . , filaments or bundles , we divided the entire greyscale range into eight equal slices and summed up the frequencies within each slice , for each individual bundling and de - bundling event ( the dotted lines in Fig . 5a ) . In this fashion , we detected appropriate sets of greyscale val - ues representing specific reaction components . Fig . 5b - f display the evolution of filaments ( f ) , small bundles ( b ) and big bundles ( bb ) for the three bundling mechanisms during the forma - tion of networks ( and clusters ) and their disassembly back into filaments . It should be noted that the time point zero in each aforementioned graph coincides with the onset of bundling or de - bundling in the microchambers . Reactions analyzed in confinements of different diameters ( d = 5 – 30 μ m ) are combined , since confinement size does not have a significant effect on the reaction dynamics . Though the hierarchical nature of bundling was prominent in case of net - works , clusters were subjected to the same analysis for comparison . Based on the data and the step - by - step nature of assembly and disassembly ð f ! k 1 b ! k 2 bb ! k 3 b ! k 4 f Þ we built kinetic mod - els ( k 1 , k 2 , k 3 , k 4 being the corresponding rate constants ) , approximating reactions to be of first order ( fits shown by dashed lines in Fig . 5 ) . Using the obtained rate constants ( Table 1 ) , the ob - served behavior of the reaction components could be satisfactorily explained ( solid lines in Fig . 5 ) . The kinetic models for networks and clusters by different bundling agents are described in detail in S2 Text . Counterion condensation - induced emerging networks show actin filaments zipping and stressed networks According to Manning counterion condensation theory , the charge density on a polyelectrolyte can be neutralized by counterions in its immediate environment , since the counterions con - dense around the polyelectrolytes in a thin layer [ 24 ] . Actin is overall negatively charged and has a linear charge spacing of 0 . 25 nm [ 25 ] . Therefore , we used Mg 2 + ions to induce actin bun - dling . Mg 2 + - induced bundling of long filaments proceeded quickly with most of the links excluded . Dashed line indicates the average of all three data sets for clusters . In total , 83 networks and 79 clusters were analyzed .

Once two filaments or two small bundles came in contact with each other , they zipped rapidly along their entire length , resulting in an accelerat - ed bundling process , as sketched in Fig . 6a and shown as time - lapse images in Fig . 6b . This dis - tinct accelerated bundling process was absent in the case of cluster formation , resulting in an overall slower bundling process ( Table 1 ) . By calculating the average zipping velocity v of two joining filaments , the drag force F d act - ing on each of the filaments during the bundling process was calculated according to the rela - tion F d = γ v . Here γ is the drag coefficient of a cylinder in the direction perpendicular to its long axis and is defined as γ = 4 π η l c / ln ( 2 h / r ) , where η is the viscosity of the buffer , l c is the con - tour length of the filament , h = 0 . 25 μ m is the average height of the filament above the surface , and r the filament radius [ 26 ] . As the filaments overcame the drag force during bundling , it di - rectly gave us the minimum force generated during bundling . The zipping velocities were simi - lar for zipping of single filaments and zipping of small bundles ( 2 – 3 filaments ) , as shown in Fig . 6c . The average values of zipping forces obtained between two filaments and between two small bundles were thus ( 0 . 15 ± 0 . 03 ) pN and ( 0 . 16 ± 0 . 03 ) pN respectively . Our values match closely with a reported value of ( 0 . 18 ± 0 . 06 ) pN for bundling of two filaments , measured using holographic optical tweezers [ 27 ] . Sharing of long filaments between bundles ( links ) created tension at the nodes as the shared filaments were stretched , suppressing their thermal fluctuations . Additionally , they were acute - ly bent at the nodes . Thus , as the networks formed , energy was stored inside them , resulting in self - generated stress . During de - bundling , Mg 2 + ions began to diffuse out of the network , de - creasing the bending rigidity of the bundles . Eventually , the release of tension from the nodes generated enough force to buckle the now more loosely bound bundles . This tension release was seen very clearly at the start of the de - bundling process , where the whole network suddenly relaxed and the links ( bundles ) buckled ( Fig . 2a - v ) . The process is sketched in Fig . 6d and color - coded in time ( from yellow to blue ) in Fig . 6e , where the arrows point out the buckling events . Summing the calculated energies required to bend each of the links , we estimated the mini - mum energy stored in the network as H total ¼ X k i ¼ 0 H i ¼ X k i ¼ 0 Z L i 0 k i ds = 2 R 2 c i , where L is the bundle networks ( and clusters ) induced by Mg 2 + ions ( n = 14 ) and PEG polymers ( n = 13 ) , respectively .

Fig . 6f shows a network before and after relaxation ; the former color - coded for the stored energy and the latter shown in grey - scale . The arrows indicate some typical cases of buckling of actin bundles . We obtained stored energies of 100 – 200 k B T , indicating that a substantial amount of internal stress was generated during the network formation ( Fig . 6g ) . It has been shown that the formation of actin networks via cross - linking proteins builds up an internal stress , resulting in kinetically trapped networks and dissipating stress through the transient unbinding events of the cross - linking molecules [ 28 – 30 ] . Here , we directly observed the stored stress in Mg 2 + - induced networks as it was re - leased and utilized in the buckling of bundles during the de - bundling process . The de - bundling process was much slower ( (cid:1) 30 min ) with bigger bundles dissociating into small bundles as well as directly into single filaments ( Fig . 5b ) . Such release of tension was not seen during the disassembly of clusters formed by short filaments . Depletion interaction - induced emerging networks form spindle - like intermediate structures Depletion interactions are non - specific , which tend to assemble large objects together in a crowded environment of sufficient number of small objects . These interactions are primarily entropic in origin as first described by Asakura and Oosawa [ 31 ] . The intracellular environ - ment is a crowded one , where 20 – 30 % of the volume is occupied by soluble proteins and other macromolecules [ 32 ] . We used PEG polymers ( M . W . 8000 ) as the crowding agents to mimic the cytoplasmic soup in a cell . Fig 6 . F - actin zipping leading to Mg 2 + - induced stressed actin networks .

Upon addition of PEG , actin filaments clustered at certain positions ( termed as poles ) to pro - duce an aster - like appearance . The poles , visualized as bright spots ( indicated by the dotted cir - cles in Fig . 7b - ii ) , were often situated close to the confinement boundary , diagonally opposite to each other . The number of poles varied between 2 – 3 and the average distance between the poles increased from about 7 μ m for small confinements up to 14 μ m for bigger confinements . Single filaments as well as few small bundles were shared between these poles ( indicated by ar - rows in Fig . 7b - ii ) . The shared filaments eventually aligned along their long axes in between the poles , resulting in the reduction of their fluctuations . This structure had a remarkable simi - larity to the spindle apparatus , which is a structure primarily based on microtubules and micro - tubule motor proteins formed during the eukaryotic cell division and essential for chromosome segregation [ 33 ] . The poles could be compared to the centrosomes , while the Fig 7 . Spindle - like intermediate structure during the PEG - induced actin network formation .

The ‘ spindle ’ stage lasted for about 8 min , followed by a bundling transition , in which the aligned filaments finally came together , forming straight and rigid bundles ( Fig . 5e ) . Fig . 7c shows the intensity profiles across the microchambers perpendicular to the pole axis ( highlighted area in Fig . 7b ) at various stages , viz . , fluctuating filaments ( blue ) , aligned fila - ments ( green ) and bundles ( red ) . The green profile exhibits small , but definite perturbations as - sociated with the sets of aligned filaments . These perturbations further developed into sharp spikes , corresponding to bundles . Thus , the aligned filaments acted as preliminary structures that finally evolved into bundles . In contrast to the disassembly of Mg 2 + - induced networks , the de - bundling process of PEG - induced networks virtually represented a reversal of the bundling process , wherein the transi - tion from bundles back to aligned filaments was observed ( Fig . 7d ) . Since PEG polymers were not present inside the bundles and did not have any direct interactions with F - actin , they were readily removed from the system . As the poles disintegrated , filaments lost their alignment and formed an entangled network . Cluster formation by short filaments showed no such spindle - like structure and the segregated clusters formed randomly . Filamin - induced emerging networks form ring - like irreversible structures Numerous ABPs such as espin , fascin , α - actinin and filamin can induce actin bundling in vivo as well as in vitro [ 1 ] . Of these , we chose to induce actin bundling by filamin dimers ( ratio of actin to filamin ( R ) = [ filamin ] / [ actin ] = 0 . 1 ) . As the filamin dimers diffused into the micro - chambers , specific protein - protein interactions between filamin and F - actin led to the bundling of actin filaments . Requiring approximately one hour for completion , the bundling reaction with filamin was comparatively slow , due to the low diffusion coefficient ( ~ 40 μ m 2 / s ) and low concentration used ( 0 . 3 μ M compared to 50 mM Mg 2 + and 6 . 3 mM PEG ) , in addition to the highly specific interactions between F - actin and filamin . The filamin - induced bundles exhibited a distinctly curved shape . The curved bundles ulti - mately met each other to form closed ring - like structures ( Fig . 2c - iv ) , similar to those previous - ly observed for filamin - induced bundle formation in vesicles [ 34 ] and in ring - like bundles formed during Drosophila oogenesis [ 35 ] . The circular walls of the confinements , however , were not responsible for the curved bundles , as the same scenario was obtained in square or tri - angular microchambers ( S6 Fig . ) . Rather , the curved nature seemed to be a consequence of the intrinsic flexibility of filamin [ 36 , 37 ] and bent conformations of long filaments within confine - ments . On the other hand , short and rigid actin filaments yielded straight bundles ( Fig . 3c ) . Surprisingly , the obtained networks could not be dissolved back to the entangled filaments ( S6 Video and S12 Video ) . Even after 12 hours of continuous flow of filamin - free solution in the controlling channel , networks were clearly visible and intact . It has been reported that the extreme stability of bundles , induced by fascin and α - actinin , endures for over half an hour with continuous protein - free wash [ 38 ] . This makes it likely that filamin - induced bundles will be at least as stable since filamin has a higher binding affinity compared to fascin and α - actinin [ 37 ] . It is possible that in vivo , some other competitive proteins might aid in the de - bundling process . In fact , there are more than 20 proteins known to affect the F - actin binding affinity of filamin [ 1 ] . Discussion Being one of the major cytoskeletal proteins , elucidating actin dynamics is important in order to understand how the cell functions . The viscoelastic properties shown by actin - based Real - Time Dynamics of Emerging Actin Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0116521 March 18 , 2015 12 / 19 structures have been abundantly investigated by various means including rheology and optical tweezers [ 7 – 9 ] . Even then , the involved microstructure dynamics that are responsible for the mechanical properties of actin networks have received less attention , especially regarding their disassembly [ 11 ] . This is mainly due to the fact that most experimental systems are closed and one needs an open system in order to study step - by - step reaction sequences . We have previous - ly shown the basic functioning of diffusion - controlled micro - confinements using divalent cat - ions as bundling agents [ 20 ] . In the same study , we also showed evaporation - assisted networks of actin bundles , whose properties strongly depended on the confinement geometry . Realizing the potential of our system , in this article we focused on the spatiotemporal evolution of net - works and bundles in a step - by - step manner . Performing a real time analysis in an open system facilitated the elucidation of reversible actin bundling , which is not possible in closed systems . Using diffusion - controlled addition and depletion of bundling agents , we observed the hierar - chical nature of bundling . We used a minimal system comprised solely of actin filaments and specific bundling agents within micro - confinements and observed significant self - organization of F - actin in the form of emerging networks of actin bundles . This emergence could be attributed to the simultaneous sharing of filaments within multiple actin bundles ( network links ) . When this sharing of fila - ments was eliminated by shortening the actin filaments down to 1 μ m , the network formation was dramatically suppressed and isolated clusters of bundles formed instead . Thus , we found two distinct length regimes : short filaments , where an exclusive bundling process is observed , and long filaments , where bundling is accompanied by percolation to form a connected net - work . We used three distinct bundling mechanisms , viz . , counterion condensation ( Mg 2 + ions ) , depletion interactions ( PEG polymers ) and specific protein - protein interactions by ABPs ( filamin dimers ) , to induce F - actin bundling . Though each of these processes have distinct characteristics , they shared a common theme of hierarchy , where filaments first formed small bundles which later joined to form bigger bundles . The diffusion - controlled depletion of the bundling agents from the micro - confinements led to the network disassembly . The observed hierarchical assembly and disassembly processes depended on the bundling agents ( the mecha - nism and the diffusion coefficient ) , the length of actin filaments and the confinement sizes . Using time - lapse epifluorescence microscopy and intensity - based image analysis , we tracked the evolution of filaments , small bundles and big bundles for each of the processes . Further - more , we used simple first order kinetic models , which fit many of the observed step - by - step dynamics . Typical sizes of eukaryotic cells range from ~ 10 μ m for yeast cells up to ~ 50 μ m for plant and animal cells [ 33 ] . We used a similar size range of the micro - confinements to perform the experiments , making them relevant on a biological length scale . The average actin filament length in cell extracts , along with the reconstituted cytoskeletal networks , is in the order of sev - eral hundred nanometers and the distribution of F - actin lengths can be quite broad , up to 13 μ m [ 39 , 40 ] . The actin concentration in vivo is more than an order of magnitude higher ( 70 – 150 μ M ) than that used in our experiments [ 40 ] . Hence , network formation is likely even for shorter filaments ( < 1 μ m ) in vivo , and the observed network formation is highly plausible in cells . Since this percolation can be directly correlated to intracellular conditions , it is likely that many of the in vivo actin - based structures will have a long - range connectivity resulting in an enhanced responsiveness to internal and external signals . Also , most experiments and theo - retical models tend to ignore the polyelectrolyte nature of F - actin and molecular crowding [ 11 ] , which we elegantly addressed using a microfluidic set - up , thus elaborating on the feasible cytoskeletal dynamics . Though the concentration of divalent cations such as Mg 2 + is in the range of few mM in vivo [ 14 ] , the total Mg 2 + levels can be as high as 10 mM , where much of it is incorporated in Real - Time Dynamics of Emerging Actin Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0116521 March 18 , 2015 13 / 19 various intracellular structures [ 41 ] . Thus , the contribution of counterion condensation - in - duced F - actin bundling is plausible in the cell , especially in a local environment ( e . g . endoplas - mic reticulum ) where the divalent concentration may be sufficiently high . During network formation , we observed a zipping behavior where filaments joined together lengthwise to form bundles . The zipping velocity was up to 12 μ m / s and the force generated during the zipping process was about 0 . 15 pN . The sharing of filaments between the bundles resulted in a stressed network . Depleting the bundling agents released this stress , allowing us to estimate the energy stored in the networks to be between 100 − 200 k B T . This provided a direct evidence for inter - nal stress generation in a network , without any active damage to it . Hence , we have demon - strated that counterion condensation is sufficient to generate internal stress within an actin network without any need of specific cross - linking proteins . The interior of a cell is a highly crowded environment and under such conditions , bundling of actin filaments by depletion interactions becomes very relevant [ 32 ] . The crowding agents induced a self - assembled ‘ spindle - like ’ intermediate structure , where F - actin condensed at few regions near the confinement boundary with shared sets of aligned filaments stretched between them . This spindle - like structure then transformed into a network of bundles . Although the components of the eukaryotic spindle mainly involve microtubules and associated motor pro - teins [ 33 ] , its similarity with the observed structure is indeed striking . The PEG - induced for - mation of spindle - like structure is entropically driven and emphasizes the presence of comprehensive ( “ global ” ) cellular processes . Also , there is a growing evidence that F - actin and myosin motors are possibly involved in spindle assembly and function [ 42 ] . The relevance of bundling and network formation via ABPs is obvious owing to their sheer number inside the cell , where each of the proteins are highly specific and are evolved to perform specific tasks . The filamin - induced networks consisted of curved , rather than straight bundles owing to the intrinsic flexibility of filamin [ 37 , 38 ] and bent conformations of long filaments within confinements . This gave rise to ring - like structures with many bifurcations . We could not disassemble the obtained networks back to entangled filaments , even after 12 hours of filamin - free environment , probably due to the highly specific interactions between F - actin and filamin . Taking into account the dynamic nature of cells and the intracellular actin bundle - based structures [ 1 ] , our in vitro experiments of step - by - step assembly and disassembly of actin bun - dles shed more light on the bundling , and particularly , the de - bundling processes . Also , it is probable that in vivo , these distinct mechanisms work together in a consortium . Finally , our study demonstrates that a controlled manipulation of dynamic minimal systems , where one can reversibly control reactions in a sequential manner , can unveil novel structures and proper - ties of macromolecules , leading to a better understanding of the complex biological world . Materials and Methods Soft lithography , microfluidic device preparation and pre - treatment We used standard soft lithography techniques to fabricate microfluidic devices . SU8 negative photoresists ( Microchem , Newton , MA , USA ) were spin coated on clean silicon wafers ( Si - Mat , Kaufering , Germany ) and exposed to ultraviolet light through appropriate chromium masks ( ML & C GmbH , Jena , Germany ) to obtain masters . To produce multi - height devices , i . e . , a device with different heights for different substructures , multi - layer photolithography was performed using a MJB4 mask aligner ( SUSS MicroTec AG , Garching , Germany ) . In order to produce a master with 0 . 5 μ m thick microchambers and a 5 . 5 μ m high controlling channel , first layer was of SU8 2000 . 5 ( MicroChem , Newton , USA ) and the second one was of SU8 3005 ( MicroChem , Newton , USA ) . Polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) and cross - linker ( Sylgard 184 , Dow Corning GmbH , Wiesbaden , Germany ) were mixed in the mass ratio 10 : 1 , degassed and Real - Time Dynamics of Emerging Actin Networks PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0116521 March 18 , 2015 14 / 19 poured on the masters followed by baking at 80°C for at least 4 hours . Cured PDMS was peeled off from the wafer , punched ( to insert the tubings later on ) , cleaned with isopropanol , dried with nitrogen and then covalently bonded to a clean glass slide after a plasma treatment at 2 mbar for 30 – 40 s in a plasma cleaner ( Harrick Plasma , NY , USA ) . To minimize the interactions of reaction components with microchamber walls , the freshly prepared device was rinsed with 1 mg / mL PLL ( 20 ) - g [ 3 . 5 ] - PEG ( 2 ) ( SuSoS AG , Dübendorf , Switzerland ) for about 30 min and then with water . The device was constantly equilibrated with water in order to eliminate evapo - ration through PDMS . Proteins and buffers Actin from rabbit skeletal muscle , fluorescent Atto488 - Actin from rabbit skeletal muscle , fila - min from turkey smooth muscle and cytoplasmic gelsolin from porcine smooth muscle were purchased in the form of lyophilized powders from Hypermol EK , Bielefeld , Germany . Poly - merization buffer ( 1 M KCl , 0 . 1 M imidazole ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 10 mM ATP , 20 mM MgCl 2 ) and dilu - tion buffer ( 2 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 2 ) , 0 . 4 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT ( dithiotreitol ) ) were also purchased in the form of lyophilized powders from Hypermol EK , Bielefeld , Germany . The powders were reconstituted in Millipore water to the required concen - trations and kept on ice or in small aliquots at - 80°C . To induce actin polymerization , polymer - ization buffer was added to the actin solution in 1 : 9 ratio . Final composition of the actin solution was 3 μ M actin , 1 . 4 – 1 . 5 mM ATP , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 – 0 . 6 mM DTT , 10 mM imidazole , 2 – 2 . 4 mM Tris - Cl ( pH 7 . 4 ) and 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 % disaccharides . Actin : Atto488 - actin ratio was 10 : 1 . In case of experiments involving gelsolin , CaCl 2 concentra - tion was increased to 0 . 2 mM . Experimental procedure To initiate the experiment , a semi - dilute ( 3 μ M ) actin solution , along with polymerization buff - er , was injected in a pre - treated device using appropriate tubing and syringe pumps ( Cetoni GmbH , Germany ) . The polymerizing filaments became confined within the microchambers due to their lowered diffusion coefficient , compared to monomers and due to an additional hindrance presented during the transit through the narrow connecting channels . Eventually , a steady - state of entangled fluctuating actin filaments was reached in a few hours . To initiate the bundling process , a solution with the same actin composition plus the required concentration of the bundling agents was introduced into the controlling channel . As the bundling agents en - tered the microchambers by diffusion , the bundling process started and was recorded by time - lapse microscopy . To start the de - bundling process , the solution in the controlling channel was changed back to the original solution , i . e . , actin solution without any bundling agent . Fluorescence imaging An Olympus IX81 inverted microscope equipped with a fluorescence illumination ( X - Cite Se - ries 120 Q ) , an appropriate filter set and a 100x ( N . A . 1 . 49 ) UApo N oil immersion objective ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) was used to perform experiments . The images were recorded with a pco . edge camera ( PCO AG , Kelheim , Germany ) using pco . camware software ( 0 . 1 – 20 frames per second , 20 – 50 ms exposure times depending on the type of the experiment ) . Image processing and analyses Images were processed using ImageJ ( 1 . 47k , Wayne Rasband , National Institute of Health , USA ) and MATLAB ( R2009a , R2012a , The MathWorks Inc . ) .
