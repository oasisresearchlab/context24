In previous literature , the stability and temporal evolution of psychobehavioral responses to an outbreak remained undeﬁned , because of the exclusively cross - sectional nature of such study designs . Methods . Using random - digit dialing , we sampled 4481 Hong Kong residents in 6 population - based surveys that were conducted at different times during and after the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) . Results . Respondents’ State - Trait Anxiety Inventory score ( range , 10 – 40 ) showed a decreasing temporal trend , from a high mean value of 24 . 8 during the peak of the Amoy Gardens outbreak to a postepidemic mean baseline value of 14 . 5 . Those who perceived a higher likelihood of contracting or dying of SARS had signiﬁcantly higher anxiety scores . Female respondents , individuals aged 30 – 49 years , and individuals with only a primary education or less were predisposed to greater anxiety . There was a positive dose - response gradient between anxiety level and uptake of personal protective measures . Males respondents , individuals at the extremes of age , and individuals with lower educational levels were less likely to engage in self - protective behavior . The presence of symptoms was the only consistent predictor for greater use of health services . There was remarkable stability in the magnitude and the direction of associations between predictors and outcomes over time . Conclusions . Our ﬁndings can assist in modifying public service announcements in the future , which should be tailored to psychobehavioral surveillance intelligence to achieve the desired behavioral outcomes . Futureresearch should explore the use of more - sophisticated techniques , including structural equation modeling and game - theoretical frameworks , to analyze population psychology and behavior , and it should integrate such ﬁndings with transmission dynamics modeling . Standard data collection in outbreak control rarely in - cludes information about the psychological responses of the population to the disease and the relevance of such responses to the agent - vector - hostepidemiological triangle .

We have previously documented the psychosocial impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) during the peak of the 2003 Hong Kong epidemic and have shown that individuals who had a heightened sense of risk perception , as well as moderate anxiety levels , were more likely than others to take personal protective measures against infection [ 1 ] . Such straight - forward protective measures against droplet and con - tact transmission proved reasonably effective for indi - vidual protection [ 2 ] and , in the aggregate on the public health level , are now generally acknowledged to have 1714 • CID 2005 : 40 ( 15 June ) • Leung et al .

Thus , psychobehavioral surveillance during infectious disease outbreaks plays an im - portant role and can inform risk communication messages to the general public . Since reporting our cross - sectional ﬁndings during the acute outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong , China [ 1 ] , we have performed a comparative analysis in Singapore and Hong Kong , attempt - ing to disentangle generic issues from culture - speciﬁc concerns [ 6 ] . Other research teams from Hong Kong , Canada , and main - land China also implemented similar psychobehavioral sur - veillance protocols for the general public [ 7 ] , health care work - ers [ 8 – 10 ] , quarantined individuals [ 11 ] , human resources specialists [ 12 ] , and rural residents [ 13 ] . However , because of the exclusively cross - sectional design of all previous surveys , an important limitation concerning the stability and temporal evolution of psychobehavioral responses remains . Therefore , to aid planning for a possible return of SARS or , more generally , for an outbreak of other infectious diseases , we report a lon - gitudinal analysis of 6 representative , population - based surveys of Hong Kong residents conducted at different times during and after the 2003 outbreak . METHODS Respondents were recruited using random - digit dialing of all land - based telephone lines in Hong Kong , where telephone penetration exceeds 98 % of households . A total of 4481 adult ( age , (cid:1) 18 years ) residents of Hong Kong completed the surveys conducted at different times throughout the SARS epidemic in 2003 and during the postepidemic period . Table 1 shows the exact periods covered by the surveys , the total number of sam - pled individuals , the number of respondents , and the corre - sponding response rates for each of the 6 surveys . Surveys 1 and 1 . 1 and surveys 2 and 2 . 1 were separate pairs of prospective cohort surveys . Survey 1 . 1 involved the prospective follow - up of the respondent cohort from survey 1 . 0 , and survey 2 . 1 in - volved the prospective follow - up of the respondent cohort from survey 2 . 0 . The remainder of the surveys were cross - sectional surveys . Survey 1 . 1 was almost contiguous with survey 2 . 0 , and survey 2 . 1 was almost contiguous with survey 3 . 0 . Therefore , pairing cohort - based designs with cross - sectional designs al - lowed us to examine the potential differences in response be - tween a survey using a repeated cross - sectional design and one using a truly longitudinal design . Survey 4 . 0 was performed independently to gauge the postepidemic population standards . The questionnaire , which was similar across all 6 surveys ( with the exception of survey 4 . 0 , for which some questions were omitted ) , consisted of 60 questions in total , 5 of which had multiple parts . It was pretested for face and content validity , length , and comprehensibility . The ﬁnal version of the ques - tionnaire was administered in Cantonese Chinese in a region where 95 % of the local resident population was ethnic Chinese . In the ﬁrst section of the questionnaire , respondents were asked about their self - perceived general health status , febrile and re - spiratory symptoms experienced in the past 2 weeks , and gen - eral anxiety levels with use of the locally validated State - Anxiety Scale of the State - Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) [ 6 , 14 – 16 ] . The second section of the questionnaire inquired about the use of health services in the previous 2 weeks . The third section of the questionnaire investigated the presence , intensity , and set - ting of direct and indirect contacts with individuals with di - agnosed cases of SARS . The fourth section of the questionnaire evaluated the respondents’ risk perception in terms of their self - perceived likelihood of contracting SARS and of survival if infected . Respondents were also asked about their beliefs concerning routes of transmission and their conﬁdence in their physicians’ ability to diagnose the disease . The penultimate sec - tion of the questionnaire assessed the extent to which various precautionary measures were being adopted . Lastly , sociode - mographic data of the respondents were recorded . We determined proportional differences between baselinede - mographic characteristics in each survey and in a generalhouse - hold survey conducted in 2002 ( commissioned by the Hong Kong Government Census and Statistics Department ) by cal - culating the effect size . The effect size is determined using a standard statistical methodology , in which a value of 0 . 1 in - dicates a small effect size , 0 . 3 indicates a medium effect size , and 0 . 5 indicates a large effect size [ 17 ] . To adjust for possible sampling biases caused by sociodemographic differences be - tween respondents and nonrespondents and to ensure that the sample was representative of the ethnic Chinese population of Hong Kong , we weighted the responses on the basis of the latest ﬁgures from the Hong Kong Census and Statistics De - partment for age , sex , and education level . As a sensitivity anal - ysis , we tested whether the unadjusted results obtained using data from all subjects were different from the adjusted results . We generated mean STAI scores ( with associated 95 % CIs ) stratiﬁed by beliefs about SARS and by sociodemographic data Psychobehavioral Responses and SARS • CID 2005 : 40 ( 15 June ) • 1715 across the 6 surveys to map the temporal evolution of the pop - ulation’s psychological status . We plotted the STAI scores graph - ically for the overall population by date of survey response and superimposed the daily number of new SARS cases and the ratio of cumulative deaths to cumulative cases ( or the “naive” case - fatality ratio [ 18 ] that was commonly adopted throughout most of the epidemic by the World Health Organization [ WHO ] and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) , as per govern - ment public service brieﬁngs during the epidemic . Initial explo - ration of the temporal pattern of STAI scores suggested abiphasic linear association between STAI scores and calendar date of re - sponse . Thus , in the regression analysis , STAI scores were re - gressed on calendar date , beliefs about SARS , and demographic characteristics , with adjustment for the clustering effect and for age , sex , and level of education attained . The inﬂection point was determined by the maximum likelihood method . Next , we computed respondents’ knowledge about routes of transmission , number of precautionary measures adopted to prevent transmission of and infection with SARS , and self - perceived likelihood of contracting and surviving SARS . We also sought to identify predictors for greater adoption of the government’s recommended precautionary measures ( deﬁned as at least 5 of the 7 speciﬁed strategies listed in ﬁgure A1 in the Appendix [ online only ] ) and higher use of health services by multivariable logistic regression . All analyses were conducted using Stata software , version 8 . 0 ( Stata ) . Ethics approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong / Hospital Au - thority Hong Kong West Cluster . Verbal informed consent was sought before proceeding with the telephone interview . RESULTS Figure 1 shows the 2003 SARS epidemic curve , the timing of the 6 different surveys , and a chronology of key related events in Hong Kong . Table A1 in the Appendix ( online only ) com - pares respondent characteristics between surveys and bench - marked against values for the general population . Anxiety levels ( STAI scores ) . Respondents’ anxiety level ( determined according to the STAI 10 - item scale score and ranging from 10 to 40 ) showed a clear temporal trend of de - crease , from a high mean value of 24 . 8 during the peak of the Amoy Gardens outbreak to a postepidemic mean baseline value of 14 . 5 as the epidemic tailed off . Figure 2 shows that popu - lation anxiety levels closely mirrored the daily reported SARS incident case count . However , there was little detectable rela - tionship between the population anxiety level and the reported , naive case - fatality ratio , which continued to climb throughout the epidemic ( because of censoring at the time of analysis , the outcome is unknown for a nonnegligible proportion of pa - tients ) . This suggests that the population anxiety level was more affected by the number of new cases , which was clearly de - creasing by the time that survey 1 . 0 was completed , as opposed to the apparent case - fatality ratio associated with the disease . Table 2 presents mean STAI scores for different sociode - mographic strata and compares mean STATI scores for those who held different beliefs about the disease . Table A2 in the Appendix ( online only ) integrates the temporal pattern with adjustment for personal beliefs and sociodemographic char - acteristics in a regression model to demonstrate the respective associations with STAI anxiety scores . Those who perceived a higher likelihood of contracting or dying of SARS had signif - icantly higher anxiety scores . Female respondents , those aged 30 – 49 years , and individuals with only a primary education or below were also predisposed to greater anxiety . Uptake of precautionary measures and knowledge and be - liefs about SARS . There was clearly a stepped increase in the extent of adopting personal protective measures from the time of survey 1 . 0 ( conducted at the time that the superspreading cluster of Amoy Gardens was emerging ) to the time of the other 4 surveys that were conducted during the rest of the epidemic ( surveys 1 . 1 , 2 . 0 , 2 . 1 , and 3 . 0 ) . We subsequently ob - served a large decrease in the postepidemic survey ( survey 4 . 0 ) because the threat of SARS no longer loomed ( ﬁgure A1 in the Appendix ; online only ) . Knowledge regarding the route of transmission progressively improved during and after the epidemic . The percentage of correct responses improved from ! 20 % of answers in survey 1 . 0 to ∼ 40 % in the next 4 surveys ( conducted later during the epidemic ) and reached a high of 1 70 % by December 2003 ( survey 4 . 0 ) . Approximately 40 % of respondents believed that they were “very likely” or “somewhat likely” to contract SARS in surveys 1 . 0 , 1 . 1 , and 2 . 0 , but this decreased to 20 % – 30 % by the end of the epidemic . Figure A1 in the Appendix ( online only ) also shows that 70 % – 80 % of respondents believed they were “very likely” or “somewhat likely” to survive SARS if infected , com - pared with an observed survival ratio of 82 . 8 % ( i . e . , a case - fatality ratio of 17 . 2 % ) [ 19 ] . The proportion of people re - sponding that they would be “very” or “somewhat” likely to survive generally decreased as the epidemic progressed , with a marked stepped decrease between surveys 1 . 1 and 2 . 0 ( con - ducted from 11 April to 1 May ) and surveys 2 . 1 and 3 . 0 ( con - ducted from 16 May to 1 July ) . This perhaps reﬂects the wide dissemination of the true case - fatality ratio after a large upward revision from 5 % to 15 % on 7 May 2003 by the WHO ( on the basis of ﬁndings from Donnelly et al . [ 18 ] that were released on the same day online ) . Predictors for the adoption of precautionary measures and health services use .

For surveys 1 . 1 and 2 . 1 , we also regressed the dichot - omous outcome on predictors in the previous survey ( either survey 1 . 0 or survey 2 . 0 ) to test whether the prediction obtained with use of repeated cross - sectional surveys is similar to results obtained from a truly prospective design . The results generally held true . Except in survey 1 . 0 , the results of which indicated that individuals who had a moderate level of anxiety were most likely to adopt more precautionary measures against SARS , we found that there was a positive dose - response gradient between anxiety level and adoption of personal protective measures , although it failed to achieve statistical signiﬁcance towards the tail end of the epidemic . Self - perceived likelihoodof contracting or surviving SARS did not predict personal protective behavior in any of the surveys . Knowledge about SARS predicted greater uptake of protective interventions in 2 surveys ( surveys 1 . 1 and 2 . 0 ) although not in the other 4 surveys . Male respondents were consistently much less likely to adopt comprehensive pre - cautionary measures against SARS .

Temporal evolution of population anxiety levels , expressed as mean State - Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) scores , and daily incidence of cases and deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) as reported in public service announcements . Case - fatality ratio is determined by dividing the cumulative number of deaths due to SARS by the cumulative number of cases of SARS . * The curve was smoothed by Lowess method . The observed mean STAI score ranges from 14 . 5 to 24 . 8 . Because of the smoothing process , the minimum and maximum scores in the ﬁgure ( 18 . 4 and 23 . 1 , respectively ) do not coincide with these observed values . not consistently met in all age groups . There were strong , pos - itive gradients associated with a higher level of educational attainment . To assess whether anxiety level was an intermediary in moderating the effects of risk perception on the uptake of precautionary measures , we reanalyzed the model while omit - ting the STAI score as an independent variable and found that the OR estimates for the 2 self - perceived likelihood factors did not change appreciably ( data not shown ) , thus conﬁrming that anxiety was not a signiﬁcant moderating factor . On the other hand , the presence of symptoms was the only robust and consistent predictor for higher health services use across all 6 surveys ( table A3 in the Appendix ; online only ) . There were no substantial ( statistically signiﬁcant ) differences in the results between the adjusted ( weighting for age , sex , and education level ) and unadjusted analyses . DISCUSSION Our longitudinal analysis allowed for the examination of tem - poral stability in survey responses and their evolution through - out the latter half of the epidemic ( extending to 6 months post hoc ) . It also enabled the prosecution of important determinants of psychological distress , adoption of precautionary measures , and health - seeking behavior , with potential application in early identiﬁcation of those subgroups requiring more intervention in the event of a similar outbreak . Taken together with our previous cross - national comparison with Singapore [ 6 ] and other similar studies from Hong Kong , Toronto , and mainland China [ 7 – 13 ] , the current ﬁndings highlight several consistent themes . First , the adoption of self - protective measures can effectively reduce the risk of infection [ 2 ] , although applicability outside of the hospital setting re - mains to be proven . Our results demonstrate that anxiety levels were highly predictive of uptake , the effect being most consis - tent and strongest during the acute phase of the epidemic . In turn , anxiety levels were strongly associated with the intensity of the outbreak and closely mirrored the daily number of new cases . Clearly , taking the psychological temperature of the pop - ulation ( e . g . , using STAI scores to measure anxiety levels ) dur - ing an outbreak can be a useful indicator of key behavioral outcomes ( e . g . , face - mask wearing ) . Public service announce - ments , which apparently inﬂuenced population anxiety levels during the SARS outbreak , can in the future be tailored to psychobehavioral surveillance intelligence to achieve thedesired behavioral outcomes , although the feasibility and effectiveness of such public service announcements should be tested . Of note , knowledge about SARS was not consistently or strongly associated with the uptake of personal protective interventions , suggesting that dissemination of knowledge alone is unlikely to have a substantial impact on behavior . Instead , public health providers should focus on other aspects of risk perception and communication . To further disentangle the interrelationships between anxiety , knowledge , beliefs , and sociodemographic characteristics , techniques such as structural equation modeling should be tried in the future .

Mean values are weighted by sex , age , and education level . STAI score ranges from 10 to 40 . Second , social marketing should be focused on certain sub - groups that were consistently less likely to adopt precautionary measures . There is a growing body of literature that examines variations in risk attitudes across the sociodemographic spec - trum [ 20 ] from which infectious disease control researchshould draw . Although these variables are generally immutable ( at least in the short term during an epidemic ) , a deeper understanding of the root causes of such differential risk perception and be - havior can help inform the development of dissemination strat - egies directed at different subgroups . It is important to identify effective strategies that can be used to induce self - protective behaviors in groups such as young male subjects , so that these strategies can be utilized when required ( e . g . , during epidemics ) and thereby increase the effectiveness of health protection programs . Third , it is reassuring that , even in the face of a massive outbreak caused by an unknown agent , the Hong Kong public was able to resist seeking care indiscriminately ; only symptom - atic individuals and , to a lesser extent , those with a positive contact history presented to formal care . However , we note that , at the peak of the epidemic , irrational beliefs about the disease ( e . g . , mistakenly perceiving the probability of survival to be “not very likely” or “not likely at all” despite the overall survival ratio of 82 . 8 % in the Hong Kong epidemic [ 19 ] ) and excessive anxiety were also associated with higher health ser - vices use . However , it is also plausible that the public avoided health care facilities because of the risks of nosocomial spread , which accounted for 49 . 3 % of all SARS cases [ 20 ] . The utility of such psychobehavioral surveillance data can be enhanced through quantitative risk and decision science analysis and integration with biomathematical modeling . More speciﬁcally , there is burgeoning interest in using a game - the - oretical framework to analyze population behavior [ 21 , 22 ] . Game theory attempts to predict individual and group behavior in situations in which the expected payoff of strategies used by individuals depends on the strategies adopted by others [ 23 ] . Integrating this with transmission dynamics modeling has the potential to yield new insights explaining population decision - making with respect to the adoption of self - protectivemeasures , travel , and social behaviors that collectively determine popu - lation mixing , all of which have an impact on the effective reproductive number and , thus , on the course of an epidemic . For example , Bauch and Earn [ 22 ] have recently quantiﬁed how risk perception inﬂuences expected vaccine uptake and coverage levels and what role is played by the epidemiological characteristics of pathogens .

Three potential limitations of our study should be men - tioned . The ﬁrst concerns the uncertain temporality of asso - ciation between variables , and the second concerns the potential for ecologic fallacy ( bias that may occur because an association that is observed on an aggregate level does not necessarily rep - resent the association that exists at an individual level ) . With the exception of the regression results of surveys 1 . 1 and 2 . 1 , the other analyses were cross - sectional in nature , and , therefore , reverse causality cannot be ruled out for the mutable variables , although the magnitude and direction of association deter - mined on the basis of repeated cross - sectional surveys were generally similar to results obtained from the 2 surveys that used a prospective cohort design ( i . e . , surveys 1 . 1 and 2 . 1 ) . Although our ﬁndings and the ﬁndings of other studies [ 1 , 6 – 13 ] suggest strong temporal correlations between different stages of the epidemic , associated public policy interventions , and psychobehavioral indices , our ecologic - level inferences are by no means deﬁnitive and must be interpreted with caution regarding cause - and - effect relationships . Lastly , our ﬁndings , being from a single epicenter , may not be generalizable to pop - ulations in other regions of the world . During an epidemic , the focus of research and action in the medical and public health communities has often ( and rightly ) been on the identiﬁcation of the responsible agent and the pathophysiology , clinical presentation , diagnosis , and treatment of the disease . Policy formulation and implementation of public health control measures , however , deserve equal attention , and such recommendations should be grounded in a thorough un - derstanding of the public’s perceptions , beliefs , attitudes , and general psychology . This present inquiry demonstrates that the promotion of protective health practices must take into account background perceptions of risk and anxiety levels in the com - munity - at - large . The psychological responses of the population in this Chinese community are shown to be an important po - tential vector for the transmission of SARS . Acknowledgments Financial support .
