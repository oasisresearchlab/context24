Cortical neurons initially develop immature neurites , but in vivo these are elimi - nated concurrently with the formation of a leading process , the future dendrite . However , the molec - ular mechanisms underlying these neuronal maturation events remain unclear . Here we show that caveolin - 1 , a major component of caveolae that are never observed in neurons , regulates in vivo - spe - ciﬁc steps of neuronal maturation . Caveolin - 1 is predominantly expressed in immature cortical neurons and regulates clathrin - independent endocytosis . In vivo knockdown of caveolin - 1 disturbs immature neurite pruning , leading process elongation , and subsequent neuronal migration . Impor - tantly , N - cadherin and L1 , which are required for immature neurite formation , undergo caveolin - 1 - mediated endocytosis to eliminate immature neurites . Collectively , our ﬁndings indicate that caveolin - 1 regulates N - cadherin and L1 trafﬁcking independent of caveolae , which contributes to spatiotemporally restricted cellular events ; immature neurite pruning and leading process elongation during early neuronal maturation . INTRODUCTION Neurons are highly polarized cells that have two functionally distinct cellular compartments : an axon , which generates and transduces action potentials , and dendrites , which receive and integrate electrical inputs from synapses . Establishment of the neural networks consisting of axons and dendrites elongated from the systematically allocated neuronal cell bodies is the basis of higher order brain functions . Axon speciﬁ - cation is morphologically reproducible in vitro , and many molecules regulating axon formation have been identiﬁed ( Arimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ; Govek et al . , 2018 ; Namba et al . , 2014 ; Yi et al . , 2010 ) . In contrast , dendrite formation differs in vitro and in vivo . Cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons extend many immature neurites , which directly mature into dendrites in vitro ( Dotti et al . , 1988 ) . In the developing cerebral cortex , newly generated neurons also exhibit multipolar morphologies with multiple immature neurites . However , unlike in vitro - cultured neu - rons , cortical neurons eliminate the immature neurites after axon speciﬁcation and concurrently form a leading process ( Ehlers and Polleux , 2010 ; Kawauchi , 2015 ; Marin et al . , 2010 ) . The newly formed bipolar neurons , with a leading process and an axon , are called locomoting neurons and migrate long distances toward the pial surface . At the ﬁnal phase of the neuronal migration , the leading process becomes branched and matures into dendrites ( Hatanaka and Murakami , 2002 ) . Thus , in the developing cerebral cortex , the dendrites originate from a leading process , rather than immature neurites . Although several molecules that control dendrite branching , an event that occurs at the late phase of neuronal maturation , have been identiﬁed ( de Anda et al . , 2012 ; Lefebvre et al . , 2015 ) , molecular and cellular mechanisms for in vivo - speciﬁc events , such as immature neurite pruning and leading process elongation , are poorly understood . Cellular morphological changes rely on not only cytoskeletal organization but also endocytosis and mem - brane trafﬁcking . Endocytosis can be classiﬁed into many types , including clathrin - mediated and caveolae - mediated endocytosis ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ) . A small GTPase , Rab5 , controls endocytosis and traf - ﬁcking to the early endosomes ( Stenmark , 2009 ; Zerial and McBride , 2001 ) . We previously reported that Rab5 - dependent endocytic pathways play essential roles in the long - distance migration of the locomoting 1 Department of Physiology , Keio University School of Medicine , 35 Shinanomachi , Shinjuku - ku , Tokyo 160 - 8582 , Japan 2 Division of Neuroscience , Faculty of Medicine , Tohoku Medical and Pharmaceutical University , 1 - 15 - 1 Fukumuro , Miyaginoku , Sendai , Miyagi 983 - 8536 , Japan 3 Laboratory of Molecular Life Science , Institute of Biomedical Research and Innovation , Foundation for Biomedical Research and InnovationatKobe ( FBRI ) , 2 - 2 Minatojima - Minamimachi Chuo - ku , Kobe 650 - 0047 , Japan 4 Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology ( PRESTO ) , Japan Science and Technology Agency ( JST ) , Saitama 332 - 0012 , Japan 5 Lead Contact * Correspondence : takeshi - kawauchi @ umin . ac . jp https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . isci . 2018 . 08 . 014 iScience 7 , 53 – 67 , September 28 , 2018 ª 2018 The Author ( s ) .

White 54 iScience 7 , 53 – 67 , September 28 , 2018 neurons in the developing cerebral cortex ( Kawauchi et al . , 2010 ) . The functional suppression of clathrin heavy chains ( HCs ) leads to a neuronal migration defect similar to Rab5 knockdown , suggesting that cla - thrin - mediated endocytosis is required for neuronal migration ( Shieh et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , classical caveolae - mediated endocytosis does not occur in neurons because neurons lack cav - eolae , ﬂask - or omega - shaped membrane invaginations ( Cheng and Nichols , 2016 ; Parton and del Pozo , 2013 ; Rakic , 1972 ; Shieh et al . , 2011 ) . However , caveolin - 1 ( Cav1 ) , which encodes a major component of cav - eolae , also has caveolae - independent functions ( Echarri and Del Pozo , 2015 ; Gioiosa et al . , 2008 ; Head and Insel , 2007 ; Takayasu et al . , 2010 ; Trushina et al . , 2006a ) and is reported as a risk gene for schizophrenia ( Allen et al . , 2011 ; Kassan et al . , 2017 ) . A relationship between caveolin - 1 and mutant Huntington disease protein ( mHtt ) has also been reported ( Trushina et al . , 2006b ) . Considering that schizophrenia is a neuro - developmental disorder and that the expression of mHtt disturbs neuronal migration in the developing ce - rebral cortex ( Barnat et al . , 2017 ) , it implies that caveolin - 1 may have a role in neural development . In this study , we found that unlike clathrin adaptor proteins , caveolin - 1 is predominantly expressed in immature neurons in the developing cerebral cortex and promotes both immature neurite pruning and leading process elongation through the internalization of N - cadherin ( Cdh2 ) and L1 ( L1cam ) cell adhesion molecules , suggesting that clathrin - independent endocytosis is required for spatiotemporally restricted cellular events in vivo . These data indicate that caveolin - 1 - mediated endocytosis regulates in vivo - speciﬁc steps of the early phase of neuronal maturation . RESULTS Caveolin - 1 Is Predominantly Expressed in Immature Neurons Caveolin - 1 expression has been reported to be low in the brain ( Cameron et al . , 1997 ; Head and Insel , 2007 ; Scherer et al . , 1996 ) . Consistent with this , low protein levels of caveolin - 1 were detected in the embryonic cerebral cortex at embryonic day 15 ( E15 ) , which were about 40 % and 20 % of its levels in E15 kidney and intestine , respectively ( Figure 1A ) , whereas other membrane - associated proteins , including clathrin HC and Rab5 , were strongly expressed in E15 cerebral cortex ( Figure S1A ) . A second antibody for caveolin - 1 was also used to verify the expression of caveolin - 1 in the embryonic cerebral cortex ( Figures S1B and S1C ) . This suggests that only a subpopulation of neurons expresses caveolin - 1 . To test this , we performed immunohistochemical analyses in mouse cerebral cortices at E17 . Caveolin - 1 proteins were mainly detected in the intermediate zone ( IZ ) and marginal zone of E17 cerebral cortices , but low levels were detected in the ventricular zone ( VZ ) and cortical plate ( CP ) ( Figure 1B ) . The IZ is a cell - sparse area , mainly populated by immature neurons with multipolar and locomoting morphologies and axon bundles of mature and immature neurons . High - magniﬁcation images show that caveolin - 1 is expressed in the immature neurites and cell soma of multipolar neurons and the soma of the locomoting neurons in the IZ ( Figures 1C and S2A ) , whereas very low levels of caveolin - 1 expression were observed in the axon bundles ( Figure S2B ) . Caveolin - 1 was barely detectable in the locomoting neurons in the CP ( Fig - ure S2A ) . This suggests that caveolin - 1 expression is transiently increased in the immature neurons in the IZ , but not in the CP , although a subset of mature neurons appear to re - express caveolin - 1 . In contrast , a - adaptin , a component of the AP - 2 clathrin adaptor complex , was diffusely expressed throughout the cerebral cortex at E17 ( Figure 1D ) . We next examined the subcellular localization of caveolin - 1 in immature primary cortical neurons at 2 days in vitro . As previously reported ( Ariotti and Parton , 2013 ) , caveolin - 1 was localized at both the plasma mem - brane and the early endosomes , as visualized with transfected plasma membrane - targeted monomeric Azami Green 1 ( PM - mAG1 ) and an early endosome marker , APPL1 , respectively ( Figures S3A and S3B ) . Caveolin - 1 was found to partially colocalize with the GD3 ganglioside - rich membrane domain ( Figures 1E and S3G ) . In contrast , no colocalization was observed with a non - raft marker ( CD71 ) or with a tetraspanin protein ( CD151 ) ( Figures 1F , S3C , and S3G ) . Little to no colocalization of caveolin - 1 was observed with Figure 1 . Continued arrows indicate the perinuclear accumulation of BODIPY - LacCer ( green ) . The graph in ( I ) shows the ratio of cells with perinuclear accumulation of BODIPY - LacCer . n = 3 ( control : 82 cells , Cav1 - sh490 : 87 cells ) . Each score represents the mean of ratios G SEM . Signiﬁcance compared with control was determined by Student’s t test ( p = 0 . 0142 ) and Mann - Whitney’s U test ( p = 0 . 0495 ) . * p < 0 . 05 .

Because Ror1 is also known to sustain caveolae structures through the interaction with Cavin - 1 and caveolin - 1 in non - neuronal cells ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2016 ) , the different localization of Ror1 and caveolin - 1 in immature neurons may support the notion that neurons lack caveolae . Involvement of Caveolin - 1 in Endocytosis in Cortical Neurons Previous electron microscopic analyses revealed that caveolae are not observed in migrating immature neurons in the embryonic cerebral cortex ( Rakic , 1972 ; Shieh et al . , 2011 ) . Consistent with this , expression levels of cavin - 1 , a molecule required for the formation of caveolae , were very low in the embryonic cerebral cortex at E15 ( Figure 1G ) . To examine caveolae - independent roles of caveolin - 1 in immature neurons , we constructed a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) expression vector targeting the coding sequence of mouse caveolin - 1 ( Cav1 - sh490 ) . When expressed in primary cortical neurons , Cav1 - sh490 efﬁciently suppressed endogenous caveolin - 1 expression ( Figure S4A ) . In immature neurons in vivo , the reduced levels of caveo - lin - 1 expression were hard to detect in low - magniﬁcation images of the Cav1 - sh490 - electroporated cere - bral cortex , because caveolin - 1 localizes near the membrane , but not the nucleus , and therefore it is hard to distinguish the staining of caveolin - 1 that is derived from the electroporated and non - electroporated cells ( Figures S5A and S5B ) . In contrast , this can be observed more clearly at higher magniﬁcation of the single immature neurons ( Figures S4B and S5C ) . We next examined the effect of caveolin - 1 knockdown on endocytosis by using BODIPY - LacCer , a potential marker for clathrin - independent and caveolin - 1 - mediated endocytosis ( Singh et al . , 2003 ; Trushina et al . , 2006b ) . At 30 min after treatment , most of the BODIPY - LacCer was internalized and transported to the perinuclear regions in control neurons . In contrast , Cav1 - sh490 - expressing neurons exhibited defects in the uptake of BODIPY - LacCer ( Figures 1H and 1I ) . A similar result was obtained when primary cortical neu - rons were treated with Alexa 555 - conjugated cholera toxin B subunit ( Pelkmans and Zerial , 2005 ; Shvets et al . , 2015 ; Singh et al . , 2003 ) ( Figure S4C ) . Together with the observation that caveolin - 1 is not colocalized with clathrin HC and a - adaptin , these data indicate that caveolin - 1 is involved in clathrin - independent endocytosis in cortical neurons . Caveolin - 1 Regulates In Vivo Neuronal Maturation Using an in vivo gene transfer technique , in utero electroporation ( Kawauchi et al . , 2003 ) , Cav1 - sh490 was introduced into mouse embryonic cerebral cortices at E14 . The electroporated cells were visualized with co - transfected EGFP . Except for short hairpin sequences , all genes were driven with a CAG promoter , un - less otherwise speciﬁed .

BothcontrolandCav1 - sh490 - electroporatedcellsnormallyex - pressed proliferative markers , phospho - histone H3 ( PH3 ) , and Ki67 , suggesting that knockdown of caveolin - 1 does not disturb the proliferation of neural progenitors ( Figures S6A and S6B ) . Normal expression of Tuj1 , a neuronal marker , and morphology of Nestin - positive ﬁbers suggested that neuronal differentiation and the extension of radial ﬁbers in Cav1 - sh490 - electroporated cells are not affected ( Figures S4B and S6C ) . At E17 , the majority of control and Cav1 - sh490 - electroporated cells were located at the IZ , where caveolin - 1 was strongly expressed ( Figure 2A ) . At this stage , the neuronal positioning did not signiﬁcantly differ between control and Cav1 - sh490 - electroporated neurons , although Cav1 - sh490 - electroporated cells were not diffusely located in the IZ , implying that cell - to - cell interactions between the multipolar - shaped immature neurons might be increased ( arrowheads in Figure 2A ) . In the lower part of the IZ ( lo - IZ ) , Cav1 - sh490 - electroporated cells extended many immature neurites , similar to control multipolar neurons ( Figures 2B and 2C ) . However , caveolin - 1 - knockdown locomoting neurons in the upper part of the IZ still extended many neurites even after forming a leading process , whereas control neurons retracted their immature neurites and formed a leading process resulting in bipolar or unipolar morphologies ( Figure 2B ) . The superﬂuous neurites in the Cav1 - sh490 - electroporated neurons resulted from both abnormal branching of the leading processes and extension of excess primary neurites from the cell bodies ( Figures 2D and 2E ) . Time - lapse imaging showed that control locomoting neurons retracted their immature neurites shortly after the leading process formation ( Figure S7A ) . 56 iScience 7 , 53 – 67 , September 28 , 2018 Figure 2 .

Scale bars : 200 m m in ( A ) and 10 m m in ( B ) . iScience 7 , 53 – 67 , September 28 , 2018 57 However , the Cav1 - sh490 - electroporated neurons retained their immature neurites for more than 6 hr after the leading process formation and were observed to retract and extend these neurites , a feature of imma - ture neurites ( Figure S7B ) . The ratio of cells in the IZ with a leading process ( locomoting ) or without a leading process ( round or multi - polar ) was not signiﬁcantly different between control and Cav1 - sh490 - electroporated cortices , suggesting that initiation of the leading process formation occurs in the caveolin - 1 - knockdown neurons ( Figure 2C ) . However , the leading process length of the Cav1 - sh490 - electroporated neurons in the IZ was signiﬁcantly shorter than that of control ( Figure 2F ) . These data indicate that caveolin - 1 is required for the pruning of neurites in immature neurons and the stabilization of the bipolar morphology . At postnatal day 0 ( P0 ) , 5 days after electroporation , most of the control EGFP - positive cells reached the superﬁcial layer of the CP , suggesting that at this stage neuronal migration was almost completed , consis - tent with previous reports ( Kawauchi et al . , 2003 , 2006 ) ( Figure 3A ) . However , substantial numbers of the Cav1 - sh490 - electroporated cells remained stalled at the IZ ( Figure 3A ) . EGFP - positive cell numbers and ﬂuorescence intensities in the upper layers of the CP ( future layers II – IV ) were signiﬁcantly reduced in the Cav1 - sh490 - electroporated cortices , compared with control ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . Importantly , co - expression of wild - type ( wt ) caveolin - 1 restored the migration defects observed in the Cav1 - 490 - electropo - rated cortices , indicating that these phenotypes are not due to off - targeting effects ( Figures 3A – 3C ) . In addition , co - expression of a neuron - speciﬁc T a 1 ( a 1 - tubulin ) promoter - driven wt caveolin - 1 expression vector ( T a 1 - wt - caveolin - 1 ) also rescued the migration defects of the Cav1 - sh490 - electroporated cells ( Fig - ures 3A – 3C ) . These data indicate that caveolin - 1 in neurons is required for proper positioning of the cortical neurons . Considering the weak expression of caveolin - 1 in the locomoting neurons in the CP , the neuronal positioning defect may result from incomplete maturation and / or abnormally increased cell - to - cell adhe - sion of immature neurons in the IZ . N - Cadherin and L1 Are Cargo Molecules of Caveolin - 1 - Mediated Endocytic Pathways We next searched for functional cargo molecules of caveolin - 1 - mediated endocytic pathways in neuronal maturation . We conducted a screen for transmembrane proteins that colocalize with caveolin - 1 in cortical neurons and observed colocalization with N - cadherin and L1 , classic cadherin family and immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion / recognition molecules , respectively , that are strongly expressed in embryonic neurons ( Figures 4A , 4B , S1A , and S8B ) , but not with Ror1 , CD151 , and CD71 ( Figure S3G ) . A small amount of N - cadherin was localized at the GD3 - rich membrane domain ( Figures S8A and S8B ) . In the immature neurons in vivo , endogenous caveolin - 1 and N - cadherin were observed in the same vesicular compart - ments , although they did not completely overlap with each other ( Figure 4C ) . To examine whether caveolin - 1 controls the trafﬁcking of these candidates , Cav1 - sh490 - transfected cortical neurons were subjected to sequential immunocytochemical analyses . Before permeabilization , the ﬁxed neurons were treated with anti - N - cadherin ( extracellular region ) antibody to visualize cell surface N - cadherin . Subsequently , the neurons were permeabilized with Triton X - 100 and treated with another anti - N - cadherin antibody to stain with total N - cadherin . Ratios of the cell surface to total N - cadherin ﬂuo - rescence intensities were measured and revealed that the ratio of cell surface N - cadherin was signiﬁcantly increased in the Cav1 - sh490 - transfected neurons , compared with control ( Figure 4D ) . Similarly , cell surface levels of L1 were also measured in primary cortical neurons . The ratio of surface to total L1 was found to be slightly increased ( Figure 4E ) . To conﬁrm this , we quantiﬁed the N - cadherin staining signals in the plasma membrane ( PM - mAG1 - positive re - gions ) and early endosomes ( APPL1 - positive regions ) . N - cadherin localization was increased at the PM - mAG1 - positiveregionsin Cav1 - sh490 - transfectedprimary cortical neurons ( Figures 4F and4G ) andimmatureneurons in vivo ( Figures 4I and 4J ) , whereas it was unchanged at the APPL1 - positive regions in the cortical neurons ( Figure 4H ) . These data indicate that caveolin - 1 is required for the internalization of N - cadherin and L1 . N - Cadherin and L1 Are Required for Immature Neurite Formation To examine the roles of N - cadherin and L1 in neuronal maturation , we performed in vivo knockdown exper - iments . Ncad - sh1023 and L1 - shRNA # 4 , shRNA - vectors for N - cadherin and L1 , respectively ( Kawauchi et al . , 2010 ; Namba et al . , 2014 ) , were electroporated into E14 cerebral cortices , and the electroporated brains were ﬁxed at E17 . Consistent with our previous report ( Kawauchi et al . , 2010 ) , a substantial portion of 58 iScience 7 , 53 – 67 , September 28 , 2018 the Ncad - sh1023 - electroporated cells exhibited round morphologies at the lo - IZ , where most of the control cells extended immature neurites ( Figure 5A ) . The ratio of cells with round and multipolar morphol - ogies in the IZ were increased and decreased , respectively , suggesting that immature neurite formation and / or maintenance is suppressed in the Ncad - sh1023 - electroporated cortices ( Figures 5A – 5C ) . Similarly , the ratio of cells with round morphology was slightly but signiﬁcantly increased in the L1 - knockdown cortices ( Figures 5A – 5C ) . These data indicate that N - cadherin and L1 are required for the formation and / or maintenance of the immature neurites ( Figure 5E ) . It further suggests that caveolin - 1 might be responsible for the downregulation of N - cadherin and L1 to eliminate the immature neurites before the transition to bipolar morphology . Interestingly , knockdown of either N - cadherin or L1 resulted in the formation of shorter leading processes in the IZ ( Figure 5D ) , indicating that N - cadherin and L1 are required for the leading process elongation in Figure 3 .

Because it is known that the membrane proteins internalized with caveolin - 1 are at least in part sorted to the Golgi apparatus or recycling endosomes in non - neuronal cells ( Nichols , 2002 ; Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ) , the N - cadherin and L1 internalized at the immature neurites may be recycled to the leading processes to promote their elongation ( Figure 7 ) . Most of the N - cadherin - or L1 - knockdown cells wereunable to migrate into the CP , consistent with previous reports ( Jossin and Cooper , 2011 ; Kawauchi et al . , 2010 ; Namba et al . , 2014 ) . However , a few of these cells were observed to enter the CP and extend leading processes , although these processes were sometimes branched ( Figure 5A ) . This appears consistent with a previous study reporting that N - cadherin - knockout neurons exhibit a migration defect but are ultimately able to extend the leading process ( Martinez - Garay et al . , 2016 ) . Caveolin - 1 - Mediated Regulation of N - Cadherin Is Required for Neuronal Maturation The aforementioned results indicate that N - cadherin is a major cargo of the caveolin - 1 - mediated endocy - tosis in cortical immature neurons . To test whether caveolin - 1 - mediated internalization of N - cadherin is required for immature neurite pruning , we performed rescue experiments . Cav1 - sh490 and a low concen - tration of Ncad - sh1023 were co - electroporated into E14 cerebral cortices , and the electroporated brains were ﬁxed at E17 . Locomoting neurons electroporated with Cav1 - sh490 alone extended many abnormal neurites as described above , whereas co - electroporation with Cav1 - sh490 and Ncad - sh1023 rescued this phenotype ( Figure 6A ) . The ratio of cells with abnormal primary neurites was signiﬁcantly restored in the Cav1 - sh490 - and Ncad - sh1023 - electroporated cells ( Figure 6B ) . However , the leading process branching was not completely rescued ( Figure 6C ) , consistent with our data that the formation of proper leading pro - cesses requires N - cadherin ( Figure 5A ) . This supports the notion that the N - cadherin that undergoes cav - eolin - 1 - mediated endocytosis is recycled to the leading process ( Figure 7 ) . Finally , we examined whether Ncad - sh1023 can rescue the migration defects of the Cav1 - sh490 - electropo - rated neurons . At P0 , 5 days after electroporation , most of the Cav1 - sh490 - and Ncad - sh1023 - co - electro - porated cells reached the superﬁcial layer of the CP , whereas many Cav1 - sh490 - electroporated cells remained stalled in the IZ ( Figure 6D ) . These data indicate that an excess of surface N - cadherin is one of the main causes of defects in immature neurite pruning and subsequent neuronal migration in Cav1 - sh490 - electroporated neurons . DISCUSSION Previous studies suggest that caveolin - 1 can act independent of caveolae ( Head and Insel , 2007 ) , but it was difﬁcult to distinguish between the caveolae - dependent and caveolae - independent functions of caveolin - 1 . Taking advantage of the fact that caveolae are not found in neurons ( Echarri and Del Pozo , 2015 ; Parton and del Pozo , 2013 ; Shieh et al . , 2011 ) and that there are no astrocytes containing caveolae ( Cameron et al . , 1997 ) in the embryonic cerebral cortices , our present results are able to shed light on the physiological functions of caveolin - 1 independent of caveolae . In Vivo Roles of Caveolin - 1 in Brain Development and Its Related Neurological Disorders Unlike an axon , dendrites arise differently in vitro and in vivo . Immature neurites become dendrites in vitro , whereas in vivo the dendrites of cortical neurons originate from a leading process . The immature neurites are eliminated during the early phase of in vivo neuronal maturation . Our ﬁndings indicate that N - cadherin and L1 are required for immature neurite formation / maintenance and that caveolin - 1 promotes the inter - nalization and down - regulation of these cell adhesion molecules to eliminate the immature neurites ( Fig - ure 7 ) . Interestingly , N - cadherin and L1 are also required for the formation of proper leading processes , suggesting that internalized N - cadherin and L1 are recycled to the leading processes to promote leading process elongation .

In addition , caveolin - 1 has been identiﬁed as a risk gene for schizophrenia , a neurodevelop - mental psychiatric disorder ( Allen et al . , 2011 ; Kassan et al . , 2017 ) .

See Figures 3B and 3C for the ratio of the iScience 7 , 53 – 67 , September 28 , 2018 63 regulates neuronal maturation in vivo , our results support a report suggesting that patients with schizo - phrenia present with an immature cerebral cortex ( Hagihara et al . , 2014 ; Nakao et al . , 2017 ) . Why Are the In Vivo - Speciﬁc Maturation Steps Required ? The in vivo - speciﬁc maturation steps appear important for neurons to ﬁnd their ﬁnal destinations , because leading processes that are only observed in vivo are thought to have a role in neuronal migration ( Bellion et al . , 2005 ; Guerrier et al . , 2009 ; Nishimura et al . , 2014 ; Schaar and McConnell , 2005 ) . Furthermore , the fact that apical dendrites originate from a pia - directed leading process in vivo , but not in cultured neurons that do not possess obvious apical dendrites , suggests that in vivo - speciﬁc maturation steps may also contribute to the pia - directed apical dendrite morphogenesis of cortical pyramidal neurons . Interestingly , long - distance migration ( locomotion mode ) appears to be an evolutionary recent migration mode ( Nadarajah et al . , 2001 ) . Considering that membrane trafﬁcking - related protein families are evolu - tionarily expanded in humans ( Pereira - Leal and Seabra , 2001 ) , membrane trafﬁcking machinery may confer the locomotion mode of migration , which requires immature neurite pruning and leading process forma - tion , to create the mammalian - speciﬁc six - layered cortical structures and the pyramidal morphologies of cortical excitatory neurons . Possible Roles of Clathrin - Independent Endocytosis One of the fundamental questions in cell biology is why endocytosis and membrane trafﬁcking pathways are highly diversiﬁed . The fact that the same membrane - associated proteins are internalized through several different endocytic pathways further confounds this problem . Clathrin - coated pits were observed at the cytoplasmic dilation ( a migrating neuron - speciﬁc unique structure found at the proximal region of the leading process ) ( Bellion et al . , 2005 ; Nishimura et al . , 2014 ; Schaar and McConnell , 2005 ; Shieh et al . , 2011 ) , whereas our results show that caveolin - 1 is predominantly expressed in the immature neurites and cell bodies , rather than leading processes , suggesting that each type of endocytosis occurs at distinct membrane regions . In addition , the downstream subcellular trafﬁcking pathway may also be different ( Nichols , 2002 ) . Interestingly , however , a recent report shows that the contribution of clathrin - independent endocytosis to total endocytic ﬂux is limited ( less than 5 % ) in cultured mammalian cell lines ( Bitsikas et al . , 2014 ) , although many other studies indicate the requirement of clathrin - independent endocytosis ( Howes et al . , 2010a , 2010b ) . Our ﬁndings indicate that caveolin - 1 is strongly expressed in the immature neurons in the IZ , but not in the subsequent locomoting neurons in the CP , whereas a clathrin adaptor subunit , a - adaptin , is broadly expressed throughout the cortex . This suggests that clathrin - independent endocytosis , including caveolin - 1 - mediated endocytosis , may be applied to spatiotemporally restricted cellular events , such as speciﬁc steps of differentiation and maturation , in contrast to clathrin - mediated endocytosis , which may be a major contributor at the basal states . In conclusion , our ﬁndings indicate that caveolin - 1 is expressed in immature neurons and regulates clathrin - independent endocytosis of cell adhesion molecules , such as N - cadherin and L1 , which is essential for in vivo - speciﬁc early neuronal maturation in the developing cerebral cortex . Although some caveolin - 1 is localized in the GD3 ganglioside - rich membrane domain , future studies are required to determine whether N - cadherin endocytosis occurs within or external to the GD3 - rich domain . Limitation of Study Our data indicate that caveolin - 1 regulates the internalization of N - cadherin , which is required for the immature neurite pruning in the developing cerebral cortex . Considering that N - cadherin promotes the extension of not only immature neurites but also the leading process and that the majority of the mem - brane - associated proteins that are internalized via caveolin - 1 - mediated endocytosis are transported to the recycling endosomes or trans - Golgi networks , the internalized N - cadherin may be recycled to the plasma membrane in the tip of the leading process and promote its elongation . However , it is difﬁcult Figure 6 . Continued number of the electroporated cells in each layer and the multiple comparison data .

Thus , we could not exclude the possibility that newly synthesized N - cadherin , in addition to the internalized N - cadherin , may contribute to the extension of the leading process . The present work indicates the in vivo roles of caveolin - 1 - mediated endocytosis , but further work is required to clearly delineate spatiotemporal differences between caveolin - 1 - mediated and clathrin - medi - ated endocytosis during neuronal maturation in the developing cerebral cortex . Analyzing the detailed localization and upstream regulator ( s ) of these types of endocytosis may be important to clarify this issue .

Plasmids Plasmids were prepared using the EndoFree plasmid purification kit ( Qiagen ) . The attR1 - attR2 sequence of the gateway system ( Invitrogen ) was inserted into pCAG = MCS2 ( Kawauchi et al . , 2005 ) and pT a 1 = MCS1 ( Sekine et al . , 2011 ) to generate the destination vectors , pCAG = MCS3GW and pT a 1 = MCS2GW , respectively . Caveolin - 1 cDNA ( ORF clone in pENTR221 , ID = 100003277 , purchased from DNAFORM ) was inserted into pCAG = MCS3GW and pT a 1 = MCS2GW to generate CAG = Caveolin - 1 and T a 1 = Caveolin - 1 . Plasma Membrane - targeted monomeric Azami - Green 1 ( PM - mAG1 ) ( MBL ) and ECFP - Mem ( Clontech ) cDNAs were inserted into pCAG = MCS2 to generate CAG = PM - mAG1 and CAG = ECFP - Mem . L1 - shRNA # 4 was a generous gift from Prof . Kozo Kaibuchi ( Namba et al . , 2014 ) . CAG = EGFP , Ncad - sh1023 and CAG = HA - N - cadherin were described previously ( Kawauchi et al . , 2003 ; Kawauchi et al . , 2010 ) . To construct shRNA - expressing vectors , oligonucleotides targeting the caveolin - 1 coding sequence ( 5’ - GGCAAGATATTCAGCAACA - 3’ ) and its complementary sequence were inserted into the pSilencer 3 . 1 - H1 vector ( Ambion ) . All contain a hairpin loop sequence ( 5’ - TTCAAGAGA - 3’ ) . These sequences were designed based on shRNA sequence analyses ( B - Bridge International , Inc ) . A control vector containing a scrambled non - targeting sequence was purchased from Ambion . In utero electroporation Pregnant ICR mice were purchased from SLC Japan or Animal Facility of RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology . Animals were handled in accordance with guidelines established by Keio University , RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology and Institute of Biomedical Research and Innovation . All electroporations in this study were performed on E14 embryos . In utero electroporation experiments were performed as described previously with minor modifications ( Kawauchi et al . , 2003 ) . Pregnant mice were deeply anesthetized and an abdominal or right dorsal incision was made to access the uterus . Approximately 1 µ l of plasmid DNA ( shRNA experiments : 3 µ g / µ l , low concentration of Ncad - sh1023 : 1 µ g / µ l , rescue experiments : 1 - 10 µ g / µ l , pCAG - EGFP : 0 . 5 µ g / µ l ) in endotoxin - free TE buffer ( Qiagen ) containing Fast Green was injected into the lateral ventricle of embryonic brains with a glass micropipette ( GD - 1 , Narishige ) . Holding the embryo in utero with forceps - type electrodes ( NEPA GENE or BEX ) , 50 ms electric pulses of 35 V were delivered five times at intervals of 450 ms with a square electroporator ( NEPA21 , NEPA GENE or CUY21 , BEX ) . After electroporation , the uterus was placed back into the abdominal cavity , allowing embryos to continue developing . At indicated stages , embryos were harvested and coronal sections of electroporated brains were prepared using a cryostat at the level of the rostral half of the hippocampus to observe the dorso - lateral region of the cortices . Cortical slice cultures Slice culture of embryonic cerebral cortices was performed as described previously ( Nishimura et al . , 2010 ) . Embryonic brains at E16 , electroporated at E14 , were sectioned into 300 µ m coronal slices with a microtome ( Leica ) in DMEM / F - 12 1 : 1 media ( Invitrogen ) . Cortical slices were cultured on the insert membrane ( Millipore ) in 2 ml of enriched media ( 100 µ g / ml transferrin , 25 µ g / ml insulin , 20 nM progesterone , 60 µ M putrescine , 10 ng / ml EGF , 10ng / ml bFGF , 5 % Fetal bovine serum and 5 % Horse serum ) ( Miyata et al . , 2002 ) in a CO 2 / O 2 incubator ( 37°C , 5 % CO 2 , 40 or 60 % O 2 ) under confocal laser scanning time - lapse microscopy , FV1000 ( Olympus ) or TCL - SP2 ( Leica ) . Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemical analyses were performed as described previously with minor modifications ( Kawauchi et al . , 2010 ; Nishimura et al . , 2014 ) . Embryonic brains were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) for several hours at 4˚C . Frozen cortical sections were washed with PBS , treated with GS - PBS ( 10 % goat serum in PBS ) or DS - PBS ( 10 % donkey serum in PBS ) containing 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 for 1 h at room temperature ( RT ) and subsequently incubated with diluted primary antibodies in GS - PBT ( GS - PBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ) or DS - PBT ( DS - PBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ) at 4˚C overnight . After three washes in PBS , sections were treated with Alexa488 - , Alexa555 - or Alexa647 - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) diluted in PBS for 1 h at RT , followed by three washes in PBS . The nuclei were stained with DAPI . Fluorescence images were obtained by TCL - SP5 laser scanning confocal microscopy ( Leica ) or A1R laser scanning confocal microscopy with a high sensitivity GaAsP detector ( Nikon ) or FV - 10i laser scanning confocal microscopy ( Olympus ) . For high resolution images , confocal images were obtained by Nikon A1R using the narrow pinhole size ( 0 . 3 or 0 . 5 ) and subjected to deconvolution processing with the Richardson - Lucy algorithm in NIS - ER software ( Nikon ) . For staining with anti - PH3 antibody or anti - Caveolin - 1 antibody ( only for high resolution images ) , frozen cortical sections were treated with HistoVT - One ( Nacalai ) for 20 minutes at 70°C after fixation . Primary cultures , Transfection and immunocytochemistry Primary culture of embryonic cortical neurons was performed as described previously with minor modifications ( Kawauchi et al . , 2006 ) . E15 mouse embryonic cerebral cortices were treated with 0 . 25 % Trypsin - EDTA for 10 - 15 min at 37 ˚C and dissociated into single cells by gentle trituration . Cells were suspended in 500 µ l of Neurobasal medium ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with B27 ( Invitrogen ) and 2 mM L - glutamine ( Sigma ; Invitrogen ) , and then plated on coverslips or 6 cm - dishes coated with 0 . 1 or 1 mg / ml poly - D - lysine ( Sigma ) . Cells were incubated at 37 ˚C for two days . Transfections into primary cultures of E15 cerebral cortices were performed using Amaxa mouse neuron nucleofector kit ( Lonza ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with some modifications . For immunocytochemistry , cells were fixed with 4 % PFA in PBS for 20 min , permeabilized with GS - PBS or DS - PBS containing 0 . 15 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min , and blocked with GS - PBS or DS - PBS for 30 min at RT or overnight at 4˚C . Primary and secondary antibodies were treated as described above for immunohistochemistry . BODIPY - LacCer or CTxB uptake assay E15 cerebral cortices were dissociated and cultured for two days . Primary cultured neurons were incubated with 5 µ M BODIPY - FL C5 - LacCer ( Molecular Probes ) in OPTI - MEM medium ( GIBCO ) for 10 min on ice and further incubated for 30 min at 37˚C . Cells were washed six times with OPTI - MEM containing 1 % BSA for 10 min at 10˚C and fixed with 4 % PFA . For CTxB uptake assay , primary cultured neurons were incubated with 5 µ g / ml Alexa555 - conjugated CTxB in OPTI - MEM for 10 min on ice , washed with Neurobasal medium and further incubated with Neurobasal medium for 30 min at 37˚C . After fixation with 4 % PFA in PBS for 20 min , cells were subjected to immunocytochemical analyses . Immunoblotting Immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously with minor modifications ( Kawauchi et al . , 2006 ; Nishimura et al . , 2010 ) . For preparing cell lysates , primary cultured neurons were washed with ice - cold PBS , treated with lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , EDTA - free Complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) , 10 mM b - glycerophosphate , 50mM sodium fluoride and 1mM sodium orthovanadate ) and harvested with a cell scraper . After 1 h incubation on ice , the lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 5 , 000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C to remove cell debris . The supernatants were mixed with SDS sample buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 2 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , 100 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) and bromophenol blue ) . Cell lysates in SDS sample buffer were separated with SDS - PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membranes . Membranes were blocked with 5 % skim milk or carbo - free blocking solution ( SP - 5040 , Vector laboratories ) in PBST ( PBS containing 0 . 05 % Tween20 ) or TBST ( 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 0 . 05 % Tween20 ) for 1h and probed with primary antibodies in 5 % skim milk in PBST or TBST or Can Get Signal reagents ( TOYOBO ) , followed by treatment with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL Plus or ECL Prime Western blotting detection reagents ( Amersham ) . Signals were detected and measured with a cooled CCD camera ( LAS - 3000mini or LAS - 4000mini , Fuji - firm ) and the Multi Gauge software ( Fuji - firm ) . Quantitative analysis for the ratio of cells with different morphology Morphology of the immature neurons in the IZ was analyzed on frozen sections of the cerebral cortices at E17 , 3 days after electroporation . The numbers of cells in the IZ with a locomoting or round or multipolar ( without a leading process ) were counted . Locomoting cells were defined as cells with a thick and pia - directed leading process . Using our definition , both round and multipolar cells do not possess a leading process . Multipolar cells were defined as cells with more than three neurites or polygonal morphology . Quantitative analysis for the leading process length and branching and the number of primary neurites The ratio of the locomoting neurons ( leading process - containing cells ) with a branched leading process or more than three primary processes to the total number of the locomoting neurons in the IZ was determined on frozen sections of the cerebral cortices at E17 , 3 days after electroporation . Leading process length of the locomoting neurons in the IZ was measured by the Leica SP5 software . Quantitative analysis for the neuronal positioning The extent of migration was estimated by recording fluorescence intensities of EGFP in distinct regions of the cerebral cortices , as described previously ( Kawauchi et al . , 2003 , 2006 ) . Fluorescence images of the frozen sections of the electroporated brains were captured by TCS - SP5 laser scanning confocal microscopy ( Leica ) . Fluorescence intensities within the same width regions in layers II - IV , V - VI , IZ , and SVZ / VZ of the cerebral cortices were measured by Leica SP5 software . Relative intensities to the total fluorescence were calculated and plotted in graphs with standard errors . For cell quantification , cell numbers within the same width regions in layers II - IV , V - VI , IZ , and SVZ / VZ of the cerebral cortices were counted and the ratio of the cell number in each layer to total cell number was calculated and plotted in graphs with standard errors . Quantitative estimation of cell surface levels of N - cadherin or L1 Primary cortical neurons ( 2 DIV ) were washed with ice - cold PBS and fixed with 4 % PFA in PBS for 20 min on ice . After two washes with PBS , cells were blocked with DS - PBS for 30 min at RT and incubated with diluted primary antibody ( anti - N - cadherin ( C3865 , Sigma ) or anti - L1 ( ab208155 , abcam ) antibody for surface N - cadherin or L1 staining , respectively ) in DS - PBS for 60 min at RT . After three washes in PBS , cells were permeabilized with DS - PBS containing 0 . 15 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min at RT , and incubated with diluted primary antibodies ( anti - N - cadherin ( sc - 7939 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) or anti - L1 ( ab24345 , abcam ) antibody for total N - cadherin or L1 staining , respectively , and anti - GFP chick antibody ( AB16901 , Millipore ) ) in DS - PBT at 4˚C overnight . Secondary antibodies were applied as described above . After three washes in PBS , cells were treated with Alexa488 - or Alexa555 - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) diluted in PBS for 60 min at RT , followed by three washes in PBS . Quantitative estimation of N - cadherin localization on the plasma membrane and early endosomes Primary cortical neurons were transfected as indicated with CAG = PM - mAG1 and Cav1 - sh490 or control vectors . After two days culture in vitro , cells were fixed with 4 % PFA in PBS for 20 min and subjected to immunocytochemical analyses for anti - mAG1 , anti - APPL1 and anti - N - cadherin antibodies . Fluorescence intensities of N - cadherin in the PM - mAG1 - positive region ( plasma membrane ) and APPL1 - positive region ( early endosomes ) in each neuron were measured using NIS elements software ( Nikon ) . The ratio of the fluorescence intensities in the PM - mAG1 - or APPL1 - positive regions to that of whole cells was calculated . For in vivo analyses , frozen sections of E17 cerebral cortices , electroporated with CAG = PM - mAG1 , CAG = HA - N - cadherin and Cav1 - sh490 or control vectors at E14 , were examined immunohistochemically with anti - HA antibody . Fluorescence intensities of HA - tagged N - cadherin in the PM - mAG1 - positive region ( plasma membrane ) in each neuron were measured using NIS elements software ( Nikon ) . The ratio of the fluorescence intensities in the PM - mAG1 - positive regions to that of whole cells was calculated . Statistical analyses Data are presented as mean ± s . e . m . Statistical significance was calculated using two - tailed Student’s t test ( for data showing normal distribution and equality of variance ) , Welch’s t test ( for data showing normal distribution , but not equality of variance ) , Mann - Whitney ' s U test ( for data that are not normal distribution or for categorical data ) , paired t test ( for paired sample ) or multiple comparison analyses ( one way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey - Kramer test ( parametric ) , Dunnett test ( parametric ) and Kruskal - Wallis test with post hoc Steel - Dwass test ( non - parametric ) ) , by using Statcel3 software ( OMS ) . A P value of < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . Supplemental References Kawauchi , T . , Chihama , K . , Nabeshima , Y . , and Hoshino , M . ( 2003 ) .
