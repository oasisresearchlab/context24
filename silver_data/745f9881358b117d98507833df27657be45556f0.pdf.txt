The results revealed higher sensitivity of the Rt for detecting IgM / IgG in the VPP subjects . Both the Rt and ELISA showed identical sensitivities for IgM detection in the VPU subjects . The ELISA was more sensitive for detecting IgG in the VPU subjects . Generally , within both the VPP and the VPU groups , Rt was more sensitive for detecting IgM / IgG among the symptomatic ( S ) compared to asymptomatic ( AS ) subjects than ELISA . Within the VPP group , the Rt was more sensitive for detecting both IgM / IgG among the AS subjects than ELISA . In the VPU group , the Rt was more sensitive for detecting IgM among the S subjects than ELISA . The ELISA was more sensitive for detecting IgM / IgG among AS subjects than the Rt . From these results we concluded that , despite the limitation of sample size , this study indicates suitability of the used Rt for detecting anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM / IgG among S subjects and sheds light on possibility of relying on the used ELISA for IgG detection among AS human subjects . Abbreviations Rt Rapid test ELISA Enzyme linked immune sorbent assay VPP Virus - RT - PCR - positive VPU Virus - RT - PCR - unchecked S Symptomatic AS Asymptomatic LSS Low socioeconomic standards HSS High socioeconomic standards Introduction SARS - CoV - 2 incubation period lasts 4 – 6 days and in 95 % of cases the onset of symptoms occurs within 14 days [ 1 ] . It induces asymptomatic ( AS ) , mild , moderate , severe with critical pneumonia , septic shock , and acute respiratory dis - tress syndrome infections [ 2 , 3 ] . The gold standard test for SARSCoV - 2 diagnosis is RNA detection using RT - PCR , yet , its readouts are influenced by the specimen types , the used reagents , the sampling time and transportation condi - tions [ 2 , 4 ] . Rapid tests , ELISA , and chemiluminescence immunoassays have been used for serodiagnosis of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 5 – 9 ] . Microbes including viruses stimulate the host immune system to produce various Ig classes including IgM / IgG which circulate for different durations according to their titers [ 10 – 12 ] . Antibody detection diagnostics rely - ing are more preferable than antigen detection kits due to their better sensitivity , feasibility , and simple development Mahmoud Mohamed Bahgat and Mohamed Hassan Nasraa have equally contributed to this work . * Mahmoud Mohamed Bahgat mm . riad @ nrc . sci . eg ; mbahgatriad @ yahoo . com 1 Research Group Immune - and Bio - Markers for Infection , The Centre of Excellence for Advanced Science , The National Research Centre , Giza 12622 , Egypt 2 Environmental Virology Laboratory , Department of Water Pollution Research , Institute of Environmental Research and Climate Changes , The National Research Centre , Giza 12622 , Egypt 3 Egypt Center for Research and Regenerative Medicine , Cairo , Egypt 4 University of Würzburg , Würzburg , Germany 5 ZB MED - Information Centre for Life Sciences , Cologne , Germany 6 TH Köln – University of Applied Sciences , Cologne , Germany 7 Department of Therapeutic Chemistry , Institute of Pharmaceutical and Drug Industries Research , The National Research Centre , Giza 12622 , Egypt M . M . Bahgat et al . 1 3 24 Page 2 of 12 [ 13 ] . Anti - spike ( S ) and nucleocapsid ( N ) IgM and IgG are targets for SARS - CoV - 2 serodiagnosis [ 14 , 15 ] . Therefore , the majority of commercially available SARS - CoV - 2 sero - diagnostics are tailored for IgM and IgG detection [ 16 , 17 ] . Multiple detection of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies enhanced both sensitivity and accuracy of diagnosis [ 18 ] . Spike pro - tein subunit 1 ( S1 ) or receptor binding domain ( RBD ) has been widely recommended to be included in antibody - detec - tion - based serodiagnostics to increase the detection specific - ity [ 19 – 22 ] . Additionally , prevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - Ig - classes may report on the infection stage ( Early / late or acute / chronic ) . After 1 week of symptom onset , 50 % of COVID - 19 patients turn IgM / IgG positive [ 23 ] , and as the time passes , antibodies titer shows significant elevation while virus load shows decrease [ 24 , 25 ] . This proposes the relevance of combining sensitive serodiagnostic assay with RT - PCR for better diagnosis of SARS - CoV - 2 , particularly , for detection of the intermediate / late stages of infection and for reporting on levels of disease severity [ 26 – 28 ] . Upon emergence / resurgence of pandemics , cocktails of diagnostics are released to the market with each manufac - turer tries to claim the usefulness of his product to have the best sensitivity / specificity to diagnose infection . In particu - lar , for pandemics caused by rapidly spreading viruses like SARS - CoV - 2 appropriate rapid decision on the infection , especially for the AS subjects is needed . It is known that the first host response to infection is to elicit antibodies to pathogen antigens . This dramatically varies according to the pathogen antigen used to detect the antibody response ( s ) in a given host . The ideal case scenario is to rely on a rapid serodiagnostic that can detect infection as early as possible , differentiate between early / late and acute / chronic infections with readouts that might correlate with symptoms intensi - ties . Therefore , here we compared the sensitivities of two different serodiagnostic assays to detect anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM / IgG in virus qRT - PCR positive ( VPP ) and virus qRT - PCR unchecked ( VPU ) Egyptian human cohorts after the first wave of the SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Of note , the VPU group was intentionally included as a control cohort for the VPP group with the aim to see how useful the used serological assays are to report on infec - tion independent of qRT - PCR results . This is of particular economic importance particularly for a developing country like Egypt where not everybody is capable to afford costs of qRT - PCR . The VPU group is composed of individuals working at the same institution , yet , of different occupa - tional nature ( daily duties ) , education and awareness levels . Accordingly , the VPU cohort was classified into individuals of low socioeconomic standards ( LSS ) and of high socioeco - nomic standards ( HSS ) . The rationale behind including these two groups , is to see if our serological results will reveal differential risk of exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 infection due to differences in the socioeconomic levels . Materials and Methods The Study Cohorts Age range of the study cohorts was 25 – 60 years , and their detailed descriptions are presented in the Supplementary Table 1 . A total of 45 VPP human subjects were included , of whom , 22 were females and 23 were males . Of the 22 females 17 were symptomatic ( S ) and 5 were AS , whereas , of the 23 males20 were S and 3 were AS . A total of 90 VPU subjects were included , of whom , 47 were females and 43 were males . Of the 47 females 27 were S and 20 were AS , whereas , of the 43 males 26 were S and 17 were AS . Based on their socioeconomic standards , the VPU group included individuals of LSS and of HSS and the classifica - tion criteria were mentioned in detail in our earlier report [ 29 ] . The LSS humans were 51 including 30 females and 21 males , while , the HSS individuals were 55 , including 24 females and 31 males . Sample Collection and Antibody Detections Collection of blood samples from the human subjects was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee at the National Research Centre , Egypt ( Meeting date : 5 . 11 . 2020 , Deci - sion number : 20166 ) and was done in compliance with the relevant laws , institutional guidelines and according to the ethical standards mentioned in the declaration of Helsinki . Blood samples of the VPP humans were kindly col - lected by out coauthors from Egypt Center for Research and Regenerative Medicine , Cairo , Egypt . SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was quantified in the collected swaps from the same individuals using the TaqPath COVID - 19 CE - IVD RT - PCR Kit ( A51738 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to the manufacturer instructions . Serum samples were separated and freshly applied on the same day of collection to the AMP rapid SARS - CoV - 2 IgG / IgM detection test ( AMEDA Labordiagnostik GmbH ; Graz , Austria ) as described by the manufacturer . This test relies on both the recombinant viral spike 1 ( S1 ) subunit and nucleocapsid ( N ) . The rest of serum samples were kept frozen until being used in IgM / IgG quantification using the anti - 2019 nCoV ( N ) ELISA kits ( Wuhan Fine Biotech ; Cat Nrs . EH4396 and EH4395 ) according to the manufacturer instructions . The changes in the optical densities ( OD ) in ELISA were measured using a multi - well plate reader ( Tecan , Switzerland ) at λ max 450 nm and reference wave - length 680 nm . Sensitivities of a Rapid Test Versus an ELISA Kit for Detecting Anti‑SARS‑CoV‑2 IgM / IgG in Sera… 1 3 Page 3 of 12 24 Statistical Analysis We did a pre - design sample size calculation on ( https : / / sam - ple - size . net / corre lation - sample - size / ) to determine the mini - mum number of samples required to conduct comparison between the two studied group using the independent t test of unequal variance analysis , bearing in mind that the statis - tical power ( 1 - beta ) should not be less than 0 . 8 , significance level threshold ( alpha ) should be 0 . 05 and results to reach this the minimum sample size of each group should be 63 . This was followed in the VPU group , while , although a smaller sample size ( n = 45 ) was included in the VPP group , it is still statistically acceptable and does not affect our conclusions . GraphPad PRISM version 5 software was used to carry out the statistical data analysis . We analyzed each serum samples in triplicate . The student’s t test was used to calculate the values of significance by compar - ing mean values ± standard deviations ( SD ) of the studied groups . Differences were considered significant when the P value was < 0 . 05 . Correlation analysis was carried out by calculating the square value of the correlation coefficient ( r 2 ) for a nonparametric and non - normally distributed data . All plots were generated using Python Seaborn package ( Ver - sion 0 . 10 . 1 ) . The Pandas library ( Version 1 . 1 . 1 ) was used to load data sets from excel sheets into data frame objects . All analysis was carried out in a Jupyter notebook ( Version 6 . 0 . 3 ) with a Python 3 . 7 . 7 work environment . Results Comparing the Rt and ELISA Sensitivities for Detecting anti‑SARS‑CoV‑2 IgM / IgG Among the VPP and VPU Groups Using the Rt , of the 45 VPP subjects , 28 ( 62 . 2 % ) were IgM and 33 ( 73 . 3 % ) were IgG positive , whereas , of the 90 VPU subjects , 17 ( 18 . 9 % ) were IgM and 51 ( 56 . 7 % ) were IgG positive . In the ELISA , of the 45 VPP subjects , 11 ( 24 . 4 % ) were IgM and 29 ( 64 . 4 % ) were IgG positive , whereas , of the 90 VPU subjects , 17 ( 18 . 9 % ) were IgM and 59 ( 65 . 5 % ) were IgG positive ( Table1 ) . From these results we can conclude that , 1 ) the rapid test generally showed better sensitivity for detecting IgM / IgG among the VPP group , 2 ) both the rapid test and ELISA showed identical sensitivities for detecting IgM among the VPU group3 ) the ELISA showed better sen - sitivity for IgG detection among the VPU group . Of note , the cut - off value for the rapid test was zero , i . e . , all values above ( 0 ) were considered positive , whereas , for ELISA the cut off values , 0 . 498 for IgM and 0 . 542 for IgG , were calculated according to the manufacturer instructions . Analysis of IgM / IgG fold changes based on the Rt and ELISA readouts within the VPU group is presented in Fig . 1a . Within the VPU group , the percentages of IgM neg - ative and positive subjects who show fold changes above the Rt and ELISA cut - offs are shown in Fig . 1b . Within the VPU group , the ratios of the IgG negative and positive subjects who show fold changes above the Rt test and ELISA cut - offs are presented in Fig . 1c . Analysis of IgM / IgG fold changes based on the Rt and ELISA readouts within the VPP and VPU groups is shown in Fig . 2a . Within the VPP and VPU groups , the ratios of IgM negative and positive subjects who show fold changes above the ELISA cut - offs are presented in Fig . 2b . Within the VPP and VPU groups the percentages of IgG negative and positive subjects who show fold changes above the ELISA cut - offs are presented in Fig . 2c . Comparing the Rt and ELISA Sensitivities for Detecting Anti‑SARS‑CoV‑2 IgM / IgG Among Subjects of the Two Different Socioeconomic Standards Within the VPU Group Within the VPU group , the ratios of IgM / IgG negative and positive subjects of L and H socioeconomic standards ( SS ) who show fold changes above the ELISA cut - offs are shown in Fig . 3 . This set of results revealed that ( 1 ) higher sensitiv - ity of ELISA for detecting anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG among subjects of the two different SS and ( 2 ) interestingly , the highest ratio of IgG fold change was reported among the HSS subjects compared to the LSS one .

In ELISA , of the 22 VPP females , 4 ( 18 . 2 % ) were IgM positive and 10 ( 45 . 5 % ) were IgG posi - tive , whereas of the 47 VPU females , 14 ( 29 . 8 % ) were IgM positive and 37 ( 78 . 7 % ) were IgG positive ( Table 2 ) . Using the Rt , of the 23 VPP males , 21 ( 91 . 3 % ) were both IgM / IgG positive , whereas , of the 43 VPU males , 7 ( 16 . 3 % ) were IgM positive and 22 ( 51 . 2 % ) were IgG positive .

Sensitivities of a Rapid Test Versus an ELISA Kit for Detecting Anti‑SARS‑CoV‑2 IgM / IgG in Sera… 1 3 Page 5 of 12 24 the higher sensitivity of IgM / IgG detection was recorded by the Rt among the VPP males . Comparing the Rt and ELISA Sensitivities for Detecting Anti‑SARS‑CoV‑2 IgM / IgG Among Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Subjects Using the Rt , of the 37 VPPS subjects , 25 ( 67 . 6 % ) were IgM positive and 29 ( 78 . 4 % ) were IgG positive , whereas , of the 8 VPPAS subjects , 3 ( 37 . 5 % ) were IgM positive and 5 ( 62 . 5 % ) were IgG positive . In ELISA , of the 37 VPPS subjects , 9 ( 24 . 3 % ) were IgM positive and 25 ( 67 . 6 % ) were IgG posi - tive , whereas , of the 8 VPPAS subjects , 2 ( 25 % ) were IgM positive and 4 ( 50 % ) were IgG positive ( Table 3 ) . From these results we concluded that , ( 1 ) the Rt was more sensitive for detecting IgM / IgG among the VPPS subjects than among the VPPAS one , ( 2 ) generally , ELISA sensitivity for detect - ing IgM was comparable among both the VPPS and VPPAS subjects , whereas , it showed higher sensitivity for detecting IgG among the VPPS subjects compared to VPPAS ones , ( 3 ) the Rt was more sensitive than ELISA for detecting IgM / IgG among both the VPPS and VPPAS subjects . Using the Rt , of the 53 VPUS subjects , 14 ( 26 . 4 % ) were IgM positive and 37 ( 69 . 8 % ) were IgG positive , whereas , of the 37 VPUAS sub - jects , 2 ( 5 . 4 % ) were IgM positive and 12 ( 32 . 4 % ) were IgG positive . In ELISA , of the 53 VPUS subjects , 6 ( 11 . 3 % ) were IgM positive and 36 ( 67 . 9 % ) were IgG positive , whereas , of the 37 VPUAS subjects , 11 ( 29 . 7 % ) were IgM positive and 22 ( 59 . 5 % ) were IgG positive ( Table 4 ) . From these results we concluded that , ( 1 ) the Rt was highly sensitive than ELISA for detecting IgM / IgG among VPUS subjects compared to VPUAS one , ( 2 ) ELISA was better sensitive than the Rt for detecting IgM among the VPUAS subjects compared to VPUS ones , whereas , it showed higher sensitivity than the Rt for detecting IgG among the VPUS subjects compared to VPUAS ones , ( 3 ) the Rt was more sensitive than ELISA for detecting IgM among the VPUS subjects compared to ELISA , and ( 4 ) the ELISA was highly sensitive than the Rt for detecting IgM / IgG among the VPUAS subjects . Comparing the General and the Gender‑Specific Means of the Anti‑SARS‑CoV‑2IgM / IgG Among the VPP and VPU Subjects Measured Using the Rt and ELISA The results revealed neither significant differences between IgM / IgG means of the two used serodiagnostics ( supplemen - tary Table 2 ) nor between IgM / IgG means of the two used assays among the genders ( Supplementary Tables 3 , 4 ) . Correlation Between Symptom Grades and Anti‑SARS‑CoV‑2 IgM / IgG Levels Among the Study Cohorts The results revealed an inverse correlation between the symp - tom grades and sero - prevalence of the anti - SARS - CoV - 2IgM / IgG that was significant ( P value = 0 . 008 ) in case of the meas - ured IgG by the Rt ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . Fig . 1 ( continued ) M . M . Bahgat et al . 1 3 24 Page 6 of 12 Discussion To the best of our knowledge the current study is the first in Egypt to compare sensitivities of a rapid test and an ELISA kit for detectinganti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM / IgG in well char - acterized serum samples . We intentionally used the VPU group as a control for the VPP group with the aim to see how useful the used serodiagnostics are to report on infec - tion independent of qRT - PCR results . This is of particular economic importance particularly for a developing country like Egypt where not everybody is capable to afford costs of qRT - PCR . Additionally , in an earlier report , we tested implication of both socioeconomic level and gender on prev - alence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM / IgG in an Egyptian cohort and compared our findings to reports from other countries relying on the used Rt in the current study [ 29 ] , accordingly , we wanted to check if the results might show differences using anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM / IgG ELISA kit . The recorded higher sensitivity of the Rt for detecting anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM / IgG could be due to presence of two antigens ( S1 and N ) on the kit cassette , while , ELISA plates of the used kit are coated with only one with ( N ) antigen . Previous reports indicated that serodiagnostics that have designed to detect both IgM and IgG classes were more sensitive compared to Fig . 2 a Fold changes in the virus - specific IgM / IgG positive individuals within the virus qRT - PCR - unchecked group ( Right ; n = 54 ) and of virus - specific IgM / IgG positive individuals within the virus qRT - PCR - positive group ( Left ; n = 39 ) recorded both by the rapid test and ELISA . b Distri - bution of the virus - specific IgM fold change degrees among the virus - specific IgM / IgG positive individuals within the virus qRT - PCR - unchecked group ( Right ; n = 54 ) and within the virus qRT - PCR positive individ - uals ( Left ; n = 39 ) . c Distribu - tion of the virus - specific IgG fold change degrees among the virus - specific IgM / IgG positive individuals within the qRT - PCR - unchecked group ( Right ; n = 54 ) and within the virus qRT - PCR positive individuals ( Left ; n = 39 ) . The rapid test cut - off value was ( 0 ) , i . e . , any value above 0 was considered positive . The ELISA cut - off values were 0 . 498 for the IgM and 0 . 542 for IgG . The Pandas library ( Version 1 . 1 . 1 ) was used to load data sets from excel sheets into data frame objects . All analysis was carried out in a Jupyter notebook ( Version 6 . 0 . 3 ) with a Python 3 . 7 . 7 work environment . All plots were generated using Python Seaborn package ( Version 0 . 10 . 1 ) . Sensitivities of a Rapid Test Versus an ELISA Kit for Detecting Anti‑SARS‑CoV‑2 IgM / IgG in Sera… 1 3 Page 7 of 12 24 those designed to detect only one of the Ig classes [ 30 ] . Cos - gun et al . reported better sensitivity of an Rt for detecting anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG compared to ELISA [ 31 ] . Addition - ally , several studies support use of serodiagnostics which contain either the S1 subunit or RBD side by side with the N antigen in order to improve both sensitivity and specific - ity of diagnosis [ 16 – 18 ] . Of note , IgM / IgG seroconversion to both the N and S antigens occurs concurrently and this partially support our observations [ 14 , 32 , 33 ] . Concerning the VPP subjects , the noticed higher sensitivity of the Rt for detecting both IgM / IgG than ELISA could be due to reliance of the Rt on two antigens ( S1 and N ) as has been mentioned above . Other explanation could be the induction of an acute immune reaction which indicated by the recorded higher IgM / IgG intensity among AS subjects . This goes along with previous reports where both the kinetic and intensity of induced immunity were a reflection for developed symp - toms and levels of disease severity [ 30 , 34 ] . The noticed , almost identical but poor sensitivities of the two assays for detecting IgM in the VPU subjects recommends their use in combination with virus - RNA detection assay to improve accuracy of early COVID - 19 diagnosis . However , the higher sensitivity of IgG detection using the ELISA indicates its suitability to follow up the long - lasting immunity . This in part agrees with the previous reports where asymptomatic and / or mild infections induced transient responses with low to moderate antibody titers [ 25 , 35 – 37 ] . Therefore , Chen et al . have suggested combination use of molecular - based and serology - based assays to improve recognition of asymp - tomatic and subclinical infections [ 38 ] . Coming to this point , we also recommend use of the herein studied Rt either alone or in combination with virus - RNA detection - based assay in order to improve diagnosis sensitivity . In developing coun - tries including Egypt , the benefits of using rapid assays for COVID - 19 diagnosis are to save the cost , time , and to be feasibly used at the point - of - care unit . Of note , ELISA are more suitable to be used for detecting IgG in cross - sectional population - based studies to retrospectively record the actual sero - prevalence rates within asymptomatic populations . Concerning genders , reliance of the Rt on two differ - ent antigens ( S1and N ) increased its general sensitivity for detecting anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM / IgG among the VPP females . Noteworthy , both of the higher prognosis and sur - vival rates allow females to show higher IgG levels than males [ 24 ] . In contrast , the generally observed higher sensitivity of ELISA for detecting anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM / IgG among the VPU females could reflect induction of intensive humoral immune response due to repeated exposure to subclinical infections [ 32 ] . The higher anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM / IgG prevalence rates among females than males revealed an increase of the risk of virus transmission among households [ 39 – 42 ] . Likewise , here one cannot exclude the cross - reactivity between anti - N IgG of the a - CoV or b - CoV since both are known to share 25 – 29 % and 33 – 47 % identity with the SARS - CoV - 2 N protein , respectively [ 43 ] . Noteworthy , number of AS subjects among the VPU group are higher than those among the VPP ones . Thus , anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM / IgG detection among the VPU group is still conceiv - able . The noticed variations in both the reported immu - nity and disease severity could be attributed to an early Fig . 2 ( continued ) M . M . Bahgat et al . 1 3 24 Page 8 of 12 infection caused by one of the seasonal human CoVs . Of interest , the Rt was highly sensitive for detecting anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM / IgG among 28 males of the two groups . However , both assays were equally sensitive for detecting IgG among the VPU group . This also can be explained by dependency of the Rt on two viral - antigens ( S1 and N ) as has been indicated above . In agreement with our findings , previous reports have also documented higher susceptibil - ity of males to SARS - CoV - 2 infection with high degrees of disease severity compared to females [ 44 ] . Of note , while Ishaq et al . have reported equal prevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG among both genders [ 45 ] . Kutsuna et al . have reported its higher prevalence among males [ 46 ] . On the contrary , higher prevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG among females was reported [ 47 ] . Therefore , more research is still needed to unravel gender - related cellular and molecular mechanisms behind the conflicting out - comes of these reports . In the VPU group , the higher ratio of IgM - positive subjects who show fold changes ranging from the Rt cut - off value to 1 could refer to higher sensi - tivity of this assay . In contrast , within the same group , the higher percentage of IgG positive subjects who show fold changes ranging from the ELISA cut - off values to 1 could point to better sensitivity of the ELISA . Therefore , we Fig . 3 a Distribution of the virus - specific IgM fold change degrees within the virus qRT - PCR - unchecked ( VPU ) ELISA - antibody positive individuals of low socioeconomic standards ( LSS ; left , n = 22 ) and of high socioeconomic standards ( HSS ; right , n = 32 ) . c Distribution of the virus - specific IgG fold change degrees among VPU ELISA - antibody positive indi - viduals of LSS ( Left ; n = 22 ) and of HSS ( Right ; n = 32 ) .

Sensitivities of a Rapid Test Versus an ELISA Kit for Detecting Anti‑SARS‑CoV‑2 IgM / IgG in Sera… 1 3 Page 9 of 12 24 recommend relying on the used ELISA for IgG detection both in diagnosis and in large - scale surveillance ( Fig . 1c ) . In the VPP group , the higher percentage of IgM positive subjects , who show fold changes ranging from ELISA cut - off values to 1 could reflect higher prevalence of the IgM within this group ( Fig . 2b ) . On the other hand , in the VPU group , the higher ratio of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG positive subjects , who show fold changes ranging from ELISA cut - off values to 1 could point to higher prevalence of the IgG within this group ( Fig . 2c ) .

In contrast , in the HSS subjects of the same group the higher percentage of IgG positive subjects who show fold changes ranging from the ELISA cut - off values to 1 could indicate higher prevalence of the IgG among these subjects compared to the LSS one ( Fig . 3b ) . In conclusion , although the limitation of the sample size , this study indicates suitability of the used Rt for detecting anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM / IgG among S subjects and sheds light on possibility of relying on the used ELISA for IgG detection among AS human subjects .
