Internalization and Degradation of Cholera Toxin by Cultured Cells : Relationship to Toxin Action 860 PETER H . FISHMAN Membrane Biochemistry Section , Developmental and Metabolic Neurology Branch , National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20205 ABSTRACT (cid:9) Using anticholeragen antibodies and ' 25 1 - protein A , we developed a specific and quantitative assay for measuring choleragen on the surfaces of cultured cells . When neuro - blastoma cells containing bound toxin were incubated at 37°C , surface toxin disappeared with a half - life of - 2 h and a significant loss was detected by 10 min . When cells were incubated with ' 25 1 - choleragen in order to measure toxin degradation , cell - associated radioactivity dis - appeared with time and a corresponding amount of TCA - soluble label appeared in the culture medium with a half - life of 4 - 6 h . No degradation was detected until 45 min . Although there was a lag of 15 min before bound choleragen activated adenylate cyclase , the enzyme became maximally activated between 45 and 60 min . Similar results were obtained with Friend erythroleukemia cells . Internalization , degradation , and activation all were blocked when the cells were maintained at 4°C . At 22°C , internalization and activation occurred , albeit at a slower rate , whereas degradation was effectively inhibited . These results indicated that chol - eragen does not have to be degraded by intact cells in order for it to activate adenylate cyclase . Some internalization of the toxin , however , appears to precede the activation process . Choleragen ( CT ) , the active agent of cholera , is composed of two components , A and B ( 4 ) . The B component binds to specific receptors on the cell surface that are believed to be the ganglioside GM , ( see reference 6 for a recent review ) . The A component consists of two polypeptide chains , A l and A2 , connected by a single disulfide bond . The A l peptide is an ADP - ribosyltransferase ( 23 ) and catalyzes the transfer ofADP - ribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD ) to the regulatory component of adenylate cyclase ( 2 , 15 ) . This modi - fication results in a persistent activation of adenylate cyclase . With intact cells , there is a definite lag period before cyclase activity begins to rise in response to the toxin ( 1 , 5 ) . When membranes are incubated with A 1 plus NAD , there is no lag ( 14 ) . It is believed that during the lag period CT or some part of it is translocated across the membrane , that Al is formed , and that adenylate cyclase is then activated by A l ( 6 , 9 , 12 , 16 ) . Several groups , using immunochemistry or cytochemistry and electron microscopy , have reported that CT becomes in - ternalized in a time - and temperature - dependent manner ( 17 , 19 , 20 ) . These observations , however , were not correlated with the activation of adenylate cyclase . Other groups have sug - gested that CT must first be degraded by the cell in order to generate a fragment that can then activate the cyclase ( 18 , 21 , 22 ) . The present studies were initiated in order to develop a specific and quantitative method for assaying surface bound CT and to follow the kinetics of CT internalization , degrada - tion , and activation of adenylate cyclase . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and Cell Culture Mouse neuroblastoma clone NB41A3 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Rockville , MD ) and grown in Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s mediumcontaining0 . 45 % glucose , 10 % fetal calfserum , and 50Jag / ml gentamicin . Friend erythroleukemic cells and rat glioma C6 cells were cultured as described previously ( 7 ) . The NB and C6 cells were grown attached to 35 - mm wells of multi - cluster dishes and the Friend cells were grown in suspension . Where indicated , C6 cells were treated with GM , as described previously ( 5 , II ) . Routinely , the cells were washed once with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and incubated in serum - free medium buffered with 25 mM HEPES and containing 0 . 01 % bovine serum albumin and 10 nM CT or " ' I - CT for 30 min at 4°C . The cells then were washed three times with ice - cold PBS , incubated in fresh serum - free medium for the indicated times at theappropriate temperature and assayed for surface CT , CT degradation , or adenylate cyclase activity as described below . Assay for Surface Toxin The incubation medium was removed and I ml of the HEPES - buffered medium ( ice - cold ) wasadded with andwithout 10 , x1 ofanticholeragen antibodies . THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY " VOLUME 93 JUNE 1982 860 - 865 After 40 minat 4°C , the cellswere washed twice with ice - cold PBSandincubated with 1 ml ofthe above medium containing 0 . 01 % bovine serum albumin and 50 nM " ' I - protein Afor 40 min at 4°C . Finally , the cells were washed three times with ice - cold PBS , dissolved in 1 ml of 1 M NaOH , andcounted in aBeckman Gamma4000 ( Beckman Instruments , Inc . , Fullerton , CA ) . Nonspecific binding wasdetermined bycarrying cells not treatedwith CTthroughthe same procedure or by omitting the antibodies . Values reported represent specific binding andare the mean oftriplicate determinations ; standard deviations ofthe means were 5 % or less . In separate studies , the concentrations of protein A and antitoxin as well as the incubation times were varied . When NB cells containing saturating amounts ofbound CT were incubated with aconstant amount of anti - CT ( 10 pl for I h ) and increasing amounts of protein A for I h , maximumbinding was observed with 30 nM protein A . When the anti - CT was varied and the protein A kept constant ( 50 nM ) , binding wasessential maximalwith 5 pl ofantibodies andlittle or no further increase was observed with more anti - CT . When the time of the twoincubations wasvaried , maximumbindingwasobserved in each case between 30 and 45 min . Thus , optimum conditions for the assay appeared to be 10 Al of anti - CT for 40 min followed by 50 nM " ' I - protein A for 40 min as described above . Degradation of Toxin After the cells containing bound 1z5í - CT were incubated in fresh medium for different times , the medium wasremoved andthe cells dissolved in I ml of 1 M NaOH . The medium was cooled to 4°C and adjusted to 0 . 1 % bovine serum albuminand 10 % TCA . Thesamples were centrifuged at 2 , 000 gfor 10 min . The supernatants , pellets , anddigested cellswere then counted for 1251 . Cell - associated radioactivity was further analyzed by SDSPAGE . Cells were scraped in 2ml of 10 % TCA and collected by centrifugation . The precipitates were dissolved by boiling for 2 min in a solution containing 2 % SDS , 5 mM dithiothreitol , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 1 M Tris - Cl ( pH 7 . 4 ) and 0 . 005 % bromophenol blue . Portions were analyzed on 12 . 5 % slab gels ( 16 ) and radioactivity was detected by slicing and counting the gels ( 16 ) or by autoradiography . Assay for Cyclic AMP and Adenylate Cyclase The activation of adenylate cyclase by CT was determined in two ways : by the increase in intracellular cyclic AMP in intact cells or by the increase in adenylate cyclase activity in membranes prepared from the cells . Forthe cyclic AMP method , the cells were incubated in HEPES - buffered medium containing l mM isomethylbutylxanthine for the appropriate times . After the medium was aspirated , cyclic AMP was extracted from the cells and assayed as described previously ( 5 ) . In thecase of the Friend cells , the cell suspensions were boiled for 5 min and assayed for cyclic AMP . For the cyclase method , the cells were incubated for the appropriate times andlysed in 2mM Tris - HCI ( pH7 . 4 ) / 1 mM EDTA / 0 . 2mM dithiothreitol by homogenizingfor 5 s with a BrinkmannPolytron ( Brinkman Instruments , Inc . , Westbury , NY ) ( 8 ) . Thelysates were centrifuged at 30 , 000 g for 15 min and the membranes were assayed for cyclase activity in presence of 50 WM GTP ( 10 ) . Materials Choleragen and choleragenoid were obtained from Schwarz / Mann ( Becton , Dickinson & Co . , Orangeburg , NY ) . Anticholeragen antiserum was raised in a burroandwasagenerous gift of Dr . W . Habig , Bureau ofBiological Standards . In a quantitative precipitin assay , 1 ml precipitated 140 jig of CT . CT was iodinated essentially as described by Cuatrecasas ( 3 ) . Protein Awaspurchased from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals ( Piscataway , NJ ) and " ' I - protein Afrom either Amersham Corp . ( Arlington Heights , IL ) or New England Nuclear ( Boston , MA ) . RESULTS Assay for Surface Choleragen When NB cells were incubated with CT and then anti - CT , there was a large increase in 125 1 - protein A binding compared with cells not treated with CT ( Table 1 ) . The cells could be lightly fixed before adding the anti - CT with little effect on the interaction of antibodies and protein A with the CT - treated cells . In the absence of anti - CT , protein A did not specifically bind to CT - treated cells and there was little nonspecific binding of the antibodies to control cells ( Table 1 ) . When NB cells were incubated with increasing concentra - tions of CT and assayed for surface CT as described above , there was increasing binding of " ' I - protein A which paralleled the amounts of 125 1 - CT bound at these same concentrations ( Fig . 1 a ) . When corrected for their respective specific activities , the ratio of protein A to CT bound at saturation was 0 . 92 . There was only a small amount of specific binding of protein A to rat glioma C6 cells ( Table II ) consistent with the few toxin receptors present on these cells ( 5 , 11 ) . When the cells were treated first with GM1 , the amount of protein A specifically bound increased ( Table II ) . When the concentration of GM , was increased , protein A binding increased in parallel up to 1 pM GM , ( Fig . 1 ó ) . In previous studies , it was shown that GM1 s Effect of CT andAnti - CT on Binding of " ' / - Protein A to NB Cells Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in the presence and absence of 12 nM CT , washed and incubated in fresh medium for 45 min at 4°C in the presence and absence of 10 Rl of anti - CT .

Before incubating the cells with anti - CT , the washed cells were incubated with 1 ml of fixative ( 4 % formaldehyde and 5 % sucrose in Dulbecco ' s phosphate - buffered saline with Ca " and Mg " ) for 1 h at 4°C .

These results indicated that the assay could be used to quantify the amount of CT on the cell surface . Internalization and Degradation of Toxin When NB cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with CT or 125 1 - CT , washed and incubated in fresh medium for different times , the amount of surface CT disappeared rapidly with a half - life of2 h ( Fig . 2 ) . The amount of cell - associated 1251 - CT also decreased and there was a corresponding increase of TCA - soluble radioactivity in the medium . Only a very small fraction ofthe label in the medium was precipitated by TCA ; even after 46 h , this accounted for < 10 % of CT initially bound to the cells . Thus once bound , the toxin did not spontaneously dis - sociate from the cell surface . The half - life of CT degradation was - 5 h . When the NB cells were fast incubated with CT or " I - CT at 4°C , washed , and shifted to 37°C , disappearance of surface CT was detected as early as 10 min , whereas loss of cell - associated 1251 - CT and appearance of TCA - soluble label in the medium occurred between 45 and 60 min ( Fig . 3 a ) . Cells containing bound 1251 - CT were shifted to 37°C and at 15 - min intervals scraped in 10 % TCA . At each time point for up to 60 min , 98 - 100 % ( 98 . 8 t 0 . 8 % ) of the cell - associated radioactivity was TCA insoluble . Analysis of this material by SDS PAGE indicated that all of the label migrated as Al or dissociated B TABLE II Effect of Treatment of Rat Glioma C6 Cells with GM , on Assay of Surface CT Additions (cid:9) ' 251 - protein A bound Cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h in the presence and absence of 1 IaM GM , ( 5 , 11 ) , washed , and assayed for surface CT .

Kinetics of Toxin Action and Degradation Under these conditions , activation of adenylate cyclase and accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP in response to CT began only after a lag of 15 min ( Fig . 3 b ) . Cyclase activation was complete between 45 and 60 min . Similar results were obtained when the NB cells were detached from the culture vessels and incubated in suspension with CT or 125 1 - CT . The rise in cyclase activity began after 15 min and there was no increase in the amount of TCA - soluble radioactivity in the total cell suspension until after 45 min . The relation between CT action and degradation also was examined in Friend erythroleukemic cells that grow in suspension . The lag period appeared to be even shorter in these cells compared to NB cells yet no CT degradation was detected until 1 h ( Fig . 4 ) . Similar results were obtained with GM , - treated C6 cells ; the studies , however were complicated by the fact that 10 - 20 % of the CT initially bound to the cells rapidly dissociated and appeared as TCA - precipitated material in the medium .

As indicated in Table IV , activation of adenylate cyclase and degradation of 125I - CT were effectively blocked at 4°C . At 22°C , however , some internalization and activation did occur without a substantial amount of degradation ( Table IV ) . As reported previously ( 5 ) , CT was able to activate adenylate cyclase of GM1 - treated C6 cells at 22°C but at a slower rate than at 37°C . At 22°C , NB cells did not begin to accumulate cyclic AMP in response to CT until at least 60 min compared with 20 min at 37°C . Similar results were obtained with Friend U w m sc uII .

NB cells were incubated with CT or the purified B component ( choleragenoid ) at 4°C for 30 min , washed , and incubated for different times at 37°C . The cells were then incubated with anti - CT and assayed for protein A binding . There appeared to be little , if any , difference in the rate of loss of surface B compared with that of CT . The decrease in protein A binding after 60 , 120 , and 210 min was 43 , 64 , and 87 % , respectively , for CT - treated cells and 42 , 62 , and 85 % , respectively , for B - treated cells . These results suggested that the holotoxin - receptor complex was being internalized . The possibility that the CT receptors were being recycled was examined . CT - treated NB cells were incubated at 37°C for different times and assayed for surface CT and 1251 - CT binding ( Fig . 5 ) . Because the amount of CT to which the cells were initially exposed was close to saturating ( see Fig . 1 a ) , < 13 % of the surface receptors were still accessible to 1251 - CT . Although the amount of surface CT decreased steadily over the course of the 6 - h incubation to 15 % of the initial value , there was only a small increase in the amount of 1251 - CT binding . DISCUSSION A specific and quantitative assay was developed for the detec - tion of CT on the cell surface based on its ability to bind anticholeragen antibodies which in turn can bind protein A through their Fc region . In the absence ofCT and / or anti - CT , there was negligible binding of 1251 - protein A to the cells . Binding was proportional to the amount of CT bound . In addition , rat glioma C6 cells , which bind only trace amounts of CT , bound very little protein A ; by treating the cells with GMI , both CT binding and protein A binding were increased . Using this assay , CT was observed to disappear from the surface of NB cells with a half - life of 2 h or less . As there was only anegligible amount ofCT detected in the culture medium ( as measured by TCA - precipitated label from " ' I - CT - treated cells ) , this loss can only be explained by internalization of the toxin or a change in the surface - bound toxin that renders its antigenic sites inaccessible to the anti - CT . Since CT ( as meas - ured with 1251 - CT ) is eventually degraded by the cells , it would appear that CT is internalized . This conclusion is supported by the electron microscope studies described below . Both CT and its B component appeared to be internalized by NB cells at the same rate . In addition , there appeared to be no recycling of toxin receptors , as NB cells treated with CT were unable to bind much 1251 - CT after most of the surface CT had disappeared . These results suggest that the holotoxin - re - ceptor complex is being internalized . When neuroblastoma N2acells were incubated with ' H - GM , followed by horseradish peroxidase - conjugated choleragen and analyzed by electron microscope autoradiography and cytochemistry , both labels underwent partial endocytosis at 37°C with time . There was a similar distribution of both labels on the plasma membrane and internal sites corresponding to the Golgi - associated vesicles and lysosomes ( N . K . Gonatas , A . Stieber , J . Gonatas , T . Mommoi , and P . H . Fishman , manuscript in preparation ) . Others , using electron microscopy , have also described the internalization of CT ( 17 , 19 , 20 ) . Hansson et al . ( 17 ) , using horseradish peroxidase coupled to anticholeragen antibodies , reported that CT remained confined to the cell surface when the temperature was 4° or 18°C . At 37°C , some penetration of CT into the plasma membrane was observed after 30 but not 15 min . The antiserum used in these studies precipitated both 864 (cid:9) THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY - VOLUME 93 , 1982 A and B components of CT ( 17 ) . Using peroxidase conjugated to CT and to B , Joseph et al . ( 20 ) observed that both conjugates were internalized by neuroblastoma cells in culture . Again , the process was dependent on time and temperature . Endocytosis of the conjugates was observed within 30 min at 37°C and they were detected in internal organelles corresponding to Golgi apparatus - endoplasmic reticulum - lysosomes ( GERL ) ( 20 ) . Whether the holotoxin conjugate contained peroxidase coupled to A or B or both was not determined . Using 1251 - CT , we also followed the kinetics of toxin degra - dation . In both NB and Friend cells , there was no detectable degradation of CT at 37°C until between 45 and 60 min . In both cells , activation of adenylate cyclase by CT is essentially completed by then . Thus , degradation of CT does not appear to be required for its action . This is supported by the studies at different temperatures . At 4°C , both activation and degrada - tion were blocked . At 22°C , however , activation occurred , although at a slower rate than at 37°C ; degradation was still effectively inhibited . These observations do not support pre - vious studies that implicated toxin degradation with toxin action . Matuo et al . ( 22 ) described the generation from CT of active fragments by proteases in sarcoma cell membranes . These fragments were as small as 1 , 400 daltons and reported to be capable of activating adenylate cyclase . Others , based on the inhibition of CT action by alkyl amines and other lysom - otropic agents , concluded that endocytosis and lysosomal proc - essing of the toxin was an essentially step for its action on intact cells ( l8 , 21 ) . There was a significant disappearance of surface CT from NB cells during the lag period before cyclase activation . Both internalization and activation were affected similarly at differ - ent temperatures . Since only a small fraction of the bound toxin may be involved in the activation of adenylate cyclase ( 5 , 13 ) , the possibility of a small pool of surface CT following different kinetics or a separate pathway can not be excluded at this time . The results do indicate that there are several discrete steps in the interaction of CT with intact cells . Initially , the toxin binds rapidly to specific receptors on the cell surface . Then , the toxin becomes internalized during which time ade - nylate cyclase is activated . Finally , the toxin undergoes degra - dation presumably in the lysosomes .
