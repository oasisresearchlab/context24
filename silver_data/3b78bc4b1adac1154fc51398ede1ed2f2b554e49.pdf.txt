Although Rab11a and Myosin Vb are involved in the recycling of proteins internalized by clathrin - mediated endocytosis , Rab8a has been implicated in nonclathrin - dependent endocytosis and recycling . By yeast two - hybrid assays , we have now demonstrated that Myosin Vb can interact with Rab8a , but not Rab8b . We have conﬁrmed the interaction of Myosin Vb with Rab11a and Rab8a in vivo by using ﬂuorescent resonant energy transfer techniques . Rab8a and Myosin Vb colocalize to a tubular network containing EHD1 and EHD3 , which does not contain Rab11a . Myosin Vb tail can cause the accumulation of both Rab11a and Rab8a in collapsed membrane cisternae , whereas dominant - negative Rab11 - FIP2 ( 129 - 512 ) selectively accumulates Rab11a but not Rab8a . Additionally , dynamic live cell imaging demonstrates distinct pathways for Rab11a and Rab8a vesicle trafﬁcking . These ﬁndings indicate that Rab8a and Rab11a deﬁne different recycling pathways that both use Myosin Vb . INTRODUCTION The organized regulation of cell surface proteins is critical to proper cell physiology . These processes include the move - ment of newly synthesized lipids and membrane proteins to the plasma membrane , the endocytosis of exogenous mate - rial , and the constant recycling of many plasma membrane receptors . Members of the Rab family of small GTPases play critical roles in the regulated trafﬁcking of a variety of mem - branous vesicles inside eukaryotic cells ( for review , see Grosshans et al . , 2006 ) . Although there is ample evidence that Rab proteins play an important part in trafﬁcking , far less is understood about how each Rab functions to coordi - nate this complex process . Some Rab proteins regulate the cargo binding of uncon - ventional myosin motors , and these motors are necessary for the proper translocation of the Rab - resident membranes ( Lapierre et al . , 2001 , Libby et al . , 2004 ) . Rab27a , in associa - tion with melanophilin / Slac2 - a , is required for the proper localization of Myosin Va to the surface of melanin - ﬁlled pigment granules in vertebrates ( Fukuda et al . , 2002 , Provance et al . , 2002 , Strom et al . , 2002 ) . Similarly , Rab11a is known to interact with Myosin Vb ( Lapierre et al . , 2001 ) , and both of these proteins interact with Rab11 - FIP2 ( Hales et al . , 2002 ) , a member of the Rab11 family interacting proteins ( Hales et al . , 2001 , Junutula et al . , 2004 ) . Rab11a , Rab11 - FIP2 , and Myosin Vb are involved in the recycling of a variety of receptors , including transferrin receptor ( Lapierre et al . , 2001 , Hales et al . , 2002 , Lindsay and McCaffrey , 2002 ) , the glutamate receptor subunit GluR1 ( Lise et al . , 2006 ) , the M 4 - muscarinic acetylcholine receptor ( Volpicelli et al . , 2002 ) , the chemokine receptor CXCR2 ( Fan et al . , 2004 ) , the poly - meric IgA receptor ( Wang et al . , 2000 ; Lapierre et al . , 2001 ) , the (cid:1) 2 - adrenergic receptor ( Moore et al . , 2004 ) , and the H (cid:1) / K (cid:1) - ATPase of gastric parietal cells ( Hales et al . , 2001 , Lapierre et al . , 2001 ) . Myosin Vc , the third member of the verte - brate class V Myosins , localizes with a portion of Rab8a and the transferrin receptor ( Rodriguez and Cheney , 2002 ) . Thus , Rab / Myosin V complexes are critical components of the anterograde pathways involved in the transport of cargoes to the plasma membrane . Another small GTPase , Arf6 , regulates the clathrin - inde - pendent endocytosis of many plasma membrane proteins , such as the class I major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) , the complement regulating protein CD59 , and the (cid:2) subunit of the interleukin - 2 cytokine receptor ( Naslavsky et al . , 2004b ) . Unlike the proteins sorted through the vesicular endocytotic recycling compartment ( ERC ) , these proteins are transported through an Arf6 - positive tubular network . EHD1 , an Eps - 15 - homology domain - containing protein , is also involved in the recycling of these clathrin - independent proteins ( Caplan et al . , 2002 ) . Arf6 regulates the localization of EHD1 to this tubular recycling network . In addition , recent investigations have shown that a guanosine triphos - phate ( GTP ) - locked mutant of Arf6 ( Arf6 - Q67L ) inhibits the tubular localization of Rab8a ( Hattula et al . , 2006 ) . Rab8a has been implicated in the regulation of plasma membrane re - This article was published online ahead of print in MBC in Press ( http : / / www . molbiolcell . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1091 / mbc .

Although it is known that Myosin Vb interacts with mem - bers of the Rab11 family of proteins , we sought to determine whether Myosin Vb could interact with other Rabs . Here , we show that Myosin Vb is also able to interact with Rab8a in a process that is distinct from Rab11a . In addition , we show that Rab8a and Myosin Vb localize to a tubular network containing EHD1 and EHD3 and that Rab11a is not associ - ated with these tubules . These ﬁndings indicate that differ - ent Rab proteins can use the same myosin motor in two distinct recycling systems . MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids and DNA The following DNA constructs have been described previously : pEGFP - Myr6 , pEGFP - and pAD - Myosin Va - tail , pEGFP - and pAD - Myosin Vb - tail , pBD - Rab11a , pBD - Rab11a - S20V , pBD - Rab11a - S25N , pBD - Rab25 , pBD - Rab25 - S21V ( Lapierre et al . , 2001 ) ; pBD - Rab11b ( Lapierre et al . , 2003 ) ; pBD - Rab27a ; pBD - Rab11 - FIP2 , pEGFP - FIP2 ( 129 - 512 ) ( Hales et al . , 2002 ) ; pEGFP - Myosin Vc - tail ( Rodriguez and Cheney , 2002 ) ; myc - EHD1 , EGFP - EHD1 , myc - EHD3 , and EGFP - EHD3 ( Caplan et al . , 2002 ) ; pmCherry ( a gift from Roger Tsien , University of California , San Diego ) . pmCerulean , and pmVenus - Myosin Vb - tail constructs were created by inserting the Myosin Vb - tail coding sequence from pEGFP - Myosin Vb - tail into pmCerulean - C1 ( Rizzo et al . , 2004 ) , pmVenus - C1 ( Nagai et al . , 2002 ) , and pmCherry - C1 ( Shu et al . , 2006 ) by using the BamHI and SalI restriction sites . The pBD - , pmCerulean , pmVenus , and pmCherry versions of wild - type and mutant Rab8a constructswerecreatedbyinsertingtheRab8acodingsequencesintopBD - GAL4 ( Stratagene , LaJolla , CA ) , mCerulean , mVenus , andmCherrybyusingtheEcoRI and SalI restriction sites . Human EHD1 and EHD3 were subcloned into mCherry by using EcoRI and SalI restriction sites . The species origin and amino acid boundaries of the Myosin V tails used are as follows : Myosin Va tail is from chicken ( GenBank accession no . NM _ 205300 ) , amino acids 1242 – 1829 ; Myosin Vb tail is from rabbit ( GenBank accession no . AF176517 ) , and it represents the analogous C - terminal 588 - amino acid region as the Myosin Va tail ; and Myosin Vc tail is from human , amino acids 902 - 1741 ( GenBank accession no . AL133643 ) . Yeast Two - Hybrid Assays Yeast two - hybrid assays were performed essentially as described previously ( Hales et al . , 2002 ) . Brieﬂy , the yeast strain Y109 was cotransformed with various Rab baits in the pBD - GAL4 plasmid and either pAD - GAL4 - Myosin Vb - tail or pAD - GAL4 - Myosin Va - tail . Transformed yeast were plated on dual - deﬁcient synthetic dropout media ( SD / (cid:2) Leu / (cid:2) Trp ) , and they were allowed to grow at 30°C for 72 h . Surviving colonies were transferred onto ﬁlter paper discs ( VWR , Westchester , PA ) , lysed by freezing twice in liquid N 2 , and incubated in 300 (cid:3) g / ml 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl - (cid:1) - d - galactoside ( X - Gal ) for up t o 4 h totest for lacZ expression . Live Imaging and Immunocytochemistry HeLa cells grown on MatTek dishes ( MatTek , Ashland , MA ) or on glass cover - slips were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding mCerulean - or mVe - nus - tagged Rab8a and Rab11a constructs by using Effectene transfection reagent ( QIAGEN , Chatsworth , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . After transfection , cells were incubated at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 for 18 h . For live cell imaging , chambers were rinsed twice in Opti - MEM ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) medium at room temperature . Live imaging was then performed at room tem - perature by using confocal microscopy on an LSM510 ( Carl Zeiss , San Jose , CA ) . Images were captured at roughly 7 - s intervals . For immunocytochemistry , 18 h after transfection , coverslips were rinsed once with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , and then they were ﬁxed by incubation in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature . Cells were both perme - ablizedandblockedbyincubationinblockingbuffer ( PBSwith1 % bovineserum albumin and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ) for at least 1 h . Blocking buffer was used for all subsequent steps . Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h , washed threetimesfor10min , incubatedwithsecondaryantibodiesfor1h , washedthree times for 10 min , and then mounted onto glass slides with Prolong Antifade reagent with 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( Invitrogen ) . The antibodies used in this study have been described previously : anti - Rab8a polyclonal ( Hattula et al . , 2006 ) ; VU57 , anti - Rab11a polyclonal ( Lapierre et al . , 2007 ) ; 8H10 , anti - Rab11a monoclonal ( Goldenring et al . , 1996 ) ; and 9E10 , anti - myc monoclo - nal ( Covance , Berkeley , CA ) . Confocal images with captured on an LSM510 ( Carl Zeiss ) . Fluorescent Resonant Energy Transfer ( FRET ) FRET microscopy was performed essentially as described previously ( Kenworthy , 2001 ) . HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were cotransfected with mCerulean - tagged Myosin Vb tail and mVenus - tagged Rab8a - WT , Rab8a - Q67L , Rab11a - WT , or Rab11a - S20V as described above . Eighteen hours after transfection , cells were washed with PBS and ﬁxed by incubation in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature . After ﬁxation , cells were washed twice with PBS and stored at 4°C until used . For microscopy , cover - slips were inverted onto a silicone membrane sealed to a glass slide . Digital images were captured on an LSM510 ( Carl Zeiss ) equipped with a 40 - mW argon laser . Three prebleach images were taken of both mCerulean ( excited at 458 nm ) and mVenus ( excited at 514 nm ) ﬂuorescence . Acceptor photobleach - ing was achieved by exciting with 100 bursts of 514 - nm wavelength light at 100 % transmission . This was followed by the collection of three postbleach images . The ﬂuorescence intensity of the photobleached region of interest ( ROI ) was measured , and the average of the three prebleach images was compared with the average of the three postbleach images after back - ground subtraction . The FRET efﬁciency was calculated as follows : E (cid:3) 100 ( mCerulean post (cid:2) mCerulean pre ) / mCerulean post , where mCerulean pre is the average ﬂuorescence intensity before photobleaching , and mCerulean post is the average after photobleaching . FRET data were collected for 10 cells per experimental condition , and each experiment was repeated three times . As a control , the ﬂuorescence intensity of mCerulean - Myosin Vb tail expressed alone was measured both before and after photobleaching . Recycling of MHC Class I Molecules MHC class I recycling was performed essentially as described previously ( Naslavsky et al . , 2003 ) . Brieﬂy , HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were transiently transfected with EGFP - Myosin Vb tail . Eighteen hours after transfec - tion , cells were cooled to 4°C in complete medium with 25 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 6 , added . Cellswereincubatedwitha1 (cid:3) g / mlmonoclonalantibody ( mAb ) against human MHC class I , W6 / 32 ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) for 30 min at 4°C . Cells were then washed three times with 4°C PBS to remove unbound antibody , and then they were incubated in prewarmed ( 37°C ) complete medium for varying times to allow MHC / antibody internalization . After internalization , cells were washed with cold PBS , and surface - bound antibodies were removed by a 30 - s incubation with 0 . 5 % acetic acid , 0 . 5 M NaCl , pH 3 . 0 , rinsed with PBS , and ﬁxed in 2 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min . Internalized MHC class I was visualized by staining cells permeablized in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 with Cy3 - labeled anti - mouse antibodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , West Grove , PA ) .

Colonies were transferred to ﬁlter paper , lysed by freezing and thawing , and incubated in an X - Gal solution . Each two - hybrid assay was considered a positive result only if X - Gal conversion ( blue color ) was visible in (cid:4) 4 h . The chart illustrates that Myosin Va tail was unable to react with any of the Rab proteins used as bait in this experiment , whereas Myosin Vb tail was able to interact with Rab11a , Rab11a - S20V , Rab11b , Rab25 , Rab25 - S21V , Rab8a , Rab8a - Q67L , and Rab11 - FIP2 . Myosin Vc tail was only able to interact with Rab8a and the GTP - locked mutant Q67L and not with any member of the Rab11 family of proteins ( Rab11a , Rab11b , and Rab25 ) or with Rab11 - FIP2 . Myosin Vb Interacts with Rab8a Vol . 18 , August 2007 2829 RESULTS Myosin Vb Interacts with Rab8a in Yeast Two - Hybrid Assays Evidence from a variety of biological systems shows that class V myosin motors require association with Rab GTPases for proper association with target membranes ( for review , see Seabra and Coudrier , 2004 ) . Previously , our laboratory identiﬁed the members of the Rab11 family of small GTPases , Rab11a , Rab11b , and Rab25 , as proteins capable of interacting with the C - terminal tail of Myosin Vb ( Lapierre et al . , 2001 ) . To identify additional regulators of Myosin Vb , we tested the ability of Myosin Vb tail constructs to interact with a variety of rab proteins in yeast two - hybrid assays . In addition to positive interactions with wild - type Rab11a , Rab11b , and Rab25 as well as GTP - locked mutants of Rab11a ( S20V ) and Rab25 ( S21V ) in a (cid:1) - galactosidase assay , Myosin Vb tail interacted with Rab8a ( Table 1 ) . Both wild - type Rab8a and the GTP - locked mutant ( Q67L ) reacted strongly with the tail of Myosin Vb , whereas the guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) - locked mutant ( T22N ) did not . No interactions were observed between Myosin Vb tail and Rab8b , indicating that the interaction with Rab8a was speciﬁc . Furthermore , any truncation of the Myosin Vb tail target inhibited the interaction with Rab8a ( Sup - plemental Table S1 ) , whereas the entire ﬁrst coil of Myo - sin Vb tail needed to be removed to disrupt Rab11a inter - action ( Lapierre et al . , 2001 ) , suggesting that the two Rab proteins bind in distinct manners . Because previous stud - ies have shown that Rab8a partially colocalizes with Myosin Vc ( Rodriguez and Cheney , 2002 ) , we also tested the ability of Myosin Vc tail to interact with Rab8a . We found that Myosin Vc tail does interact with both wild - type Rab8a and Rab8a - Q67L but not with Rab8a - T22N , Rab8b , Rab11a , or any other Rab tested ( Table 1 ) . Neither Rab11a nor Rab8a interacted with Myosin Va tail . Myosin Vb Tail Alters Endogenous Rab8a Distribution In Vivo Exogenous expression of the cargo binding domain of many molecular motors results in a dominant - negative phenotype speciﬁc to that motor ( Wu et al . , 1998 , Lapierre et al . , 2001 , Rodriguez and Cheney , 2002 ) . This approach is frequently used to conﬁrm in vitro interactions between a Figure 1 . Myosin Vb disrupts Rab8a tubular localization . ( A – C ) HeLa cells stained with an - ti - Rab8a polyclonal primary and Cy3 - labeled secondary antibodies were imaged by confo - cal microscopy . Three examples are shown . Bar , 10 (cid:3) m ( A and B ) and 5 (cid:3) m ( C ) . ( D ) HeLa cells transfected with pEGFP - Myosin Va tail ( MVa - tail ) and stained for Rab8a as in de - scribed in A . Myosin Va tail does not colocal - ize with endogenous Rab8a . ( E ) HeLa cells transfected with pEGFP - Myosin Vb tail ( MVb - tail ) and stained for Rab8a . Myosin Vb tail localizes to a perinuclear cisterna and causes Rab8a to localize to the same cisterna . ( F ) HeLa cells transfected with pEGFP - Myosin Vc tail ( MVc - tail ) and stained for Rab8a show a similar result as Myosin Vb tail , although in this case , Myosin Vc tail labels round vesicular structures . Bar , 10 (cid:3) m ( D – F ) . J . T . Roland et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2830 motor and its putative cargoes or associated proteins . In Myosin Vb , expression of the C - terminal 588 amino acids of mammalian Myosin Vb results in an inhibition of the Rab11a - based recycling of receptors such as CXCR2 and GluR1 ( Fan et al . , 2004 , Lise et al . , 2006 ) . To conﬁrm our yeast two - hybrid observations in vivo , we transfected HeLa cells with ﬂuorescent protein - tagged Myosin Vb tail constructs , and we probed for endogenous Rab8a with a speciﬁc rabbit polyclonal antibody . In nontransfected cells , Rab8a was localized to a system of long tubules and small vesicles ( Figure 1 , A – C ) that were not associated with markers of the Golgi apparatus or endoplasmic re - ticulum ( Supplemental Figure S1 ) as described previously ( Hattula et al . , 2006 ) . As reported previously , in a typical HeLa cell culture , (cid:5) 10 % of cells showed the tubular Rab8a pattern at any time ( Hattula et al . , 2006 ) . As seen in Figure 1E , expression of dominant - negative Myosin Vb tail constructs dramatically altered the distribution of en - dogenous Rab8a . In Myosin Vb tail - expressing cells , Rab8a lost its tubular localization and instead relocated to a cluster of perinuclear puncta that colocalized with My - osin Vb tail . This pattern was similar to the effect that expression of Myosin Vb tail has on the localization of Rab11a ( Lapierre et al . , 2001 ) and known recycling cargoes ( Brock et al . , 2003 , Hobdy - Henderson et al . , 2003 , Fan et al . , 2004 , Lise et al . , 2006 ) . As reported previously ( Rodriguez and Cheney , 2002 ) , expressed Myosin Vc tail also colocal - ized with Rab8a and altered its distribution ( Figure 1F ) . In contrast , expression of Myosin Va tail did not perturb Rab8a tubular localization ( Figure 1D ) . The altered localization of Rab8a seen in Myosin Vb tail - expressing cells indicates that disruption of normal Myosin Vb function affects Rab8a , but it does not directly demon - strate that the two proteins colocalize in the absence of such a disruption . To determine whether Rab8a does indeed lo - calize with wild - type Myosin Vb in vivo , HeLa cells were transfected with an enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein ( EGFP ) - tagged full - length rat Myosin Vb ( Myr6 ) construct , and they were probed for endogenous Rab8a . Overex - pressed EGFP - Myr6 was predominantly observed on tu - bules that often costained for Rab8a ; not all Rab8a - positive tubules were EGFP - Myr6 positive ( Figure 2 , A and B ) . In contrast , endogenous Rab11a is only localized to tubules in the presence of EGFP - Myr6 ( Figure 2C ) . The observation that Myosin Vb tail altered Rab8a local - ization in vivo suggested that Rab8a might reside within the Rab11a - regulated recycling system . However , immuno - staining for both endogenous Rab proteins revealed that they have limited overlapping localization , whereas the ma - jority of the staining for each Rab is distinct ( Figure 3A ) . Overexpression of either Rab protein did not alter the dis - tribution of the other protein ( Figure 3 , B and C ) . In agree - ment with previous data ( Hattula et al . , 2006 ) , overexpres - sion of either Rab4a or Rab5a , two other Rabs involved in recycling ( Zerial and McBride , 2001 ) , did not alter Rab8a tubular localization either ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) . Impor - tantly , and in contrast to previous studies with Rab11a , expression of dominant - negative Rab11 - FIP2 ( 129 - 512 ) , a protein that binds both Rab11a and Myosin Vb ( Hales et al . , 2002 ) , did not alter the distribution of Rab8a ( Figure 3D ) . All of these results suggest that the Rab8a and Rab11a interact with Myosin Vb at different steps in the recycling system or in distinct recycling pathways . Figure 2 . Full - length Myosin Vb and endoge - nous Rab8a colocalize . ( A and B ) Endogenous Rab8a was labeled by immunohistochemical techniques in HeLa cells expressing EGFP - tagged full - length Myosin Vb ( GFP - Myr6 ) . Both Rab8a and full - length Myosin Vb localize to a system of long tubules , similar to what is ob - served for Rab8a alone in nonexpressing cells . Bar , 10 (cid:3) m ( A ) and 5 (cid:3) m ( B ) . ( C ) Endogenous Rab11a was labeled in HeLa cells expressing pEGFP - Myr6 . Rab11a and full - length Myosin Vb also colocalize . Bar , 10 (cid:3) m . Myosin Vb Interacts with Rab8a Vol . 18 , August 2007 2831 Rab8a and Rab11a Interact with Myosin Vb Tail In Situ Although yeast two - hybrid and colocalization all indi - cate that Rab8a and Myosin Vb interact , neither of these assays can show conclusively that the two proteins are in direct con - tact in vivo . In addition , as is the case with Rab11a , we were unable to coimmunoprecipitate Rab8a and full - length Myosin Vb from detergent - solubilized cells ( Lapierre et al . , 2001 ) . For this reason , we sought to evaluate protein – protein interactions with Myosin Vb tail by FRET . Speciﬁcally , we used the method of acceptor photobleaching FRET ( Kenworthy , 2001 ) between Rab8a or Rab11a and Myosin Vb tail . In this method , FRET was measured by analyzing the increase in the donor tag’s ﬂuorescent signal before and after the acceptor tag is pho - tobleached . Target proteins were tagged with either the monomeric cyan ﬂuorescent protein derivative mCerulean ( Rizzo et al . , 2004 ) or the monomeric yellow ﬂuorescent protein derivative mVenus ( Nagai et al . , 2002 ) . HeLa cells were cotransfected with mCerulean - tagged Myosin Vb - tail and either mVenus - tagged Rab8a or Rab11a constructs . Fig - ure 4 represents the results of 30 averaged FRET measure - ments for each condition listed . Only wild - type and GTP - locked mutants were able to be analyzed by FRET , because the GDP - locked mutants do not colocalize with Myosin Vb tail . Our data show that both Rab8a and Rab11a produced a positive FRET signal with Myosin Vb tail after acceptor photobleaching , whereas mCerulean - Myosin Vb tail alone did not . The energy transfer efﬁciencies measured for wild - type and GTP - locked Rab8a were 15 . 1 (cid:6) 1 . 6 and 10 . 1 % (cid:6) 1 . 1 , respectively . Similarly , the energy transfer efﬁciencies for wild - type and GTP - locked Rab11a were 15 . 6 (cid:6) 1 . 0 and 13 . 9 (cid:6) 1 . 1 % , respectively . In addition to these FRET pairs , Rab8b and Myosin Vb tail , or Rab8a and Myosin Va tail , were coexpressed to control for speciﬁcity . Neither of these two combinations colocalized or produced a positive FRET measurement ( Supplemental Figure S3 ) , indicating that the FRET observed between Rab8a or Rab11a and Myosin Vb tail was speciﬁc . Rab11a - and Rab8a - positive Vesicles and Tubules Deﬁne Distinct Trafﬁcking Pathways In Vivo Myosin Vb is known to interact with members of the Rab11 family ( Lapierre et al . , 2001 ) , yet our immunocytochemical Figure 3 . Rab8a and Rab11a have distinct localizations . ( A ) HeLa cells were labeled with an anti - Rab8a rabbit polyclonal anti - body and an anti - Rab11a mouse mAb ( 8H10 ) as well as Cy3 - labeled anti - rabbit and Alexa 488 - labeled anti - mouse secondary antibod - ies , and they were imaged by confocal mi - croscopy . Staining for both Rab proteins re - veals that endogenous Rab8a and Rab11a have distinct localizations with little or no overlapping localization . ( B ) Overexpression of EGFP - tagged Rab11a ( GFP - Rab11a ) does not colocalize with endogenous Rab8a , nor does expressed EGFP - Rab11a disrupt Rab8a tubular staining pattern . ( C ) Overexpression of mCherry - tagged Rab8a ( mCherry - Rab8a ) in HeLa cells does not overlap with or alter endogenous Rab11a staining . Rab11a was la - beled with an anti - Rab11a rabbit polyclonal antibody ( VU57 ) and Alexa 488 - labeled anti - rabbit secondary antibodies . ( D ) Endoge - nous Rab8a tubular localization is not per - turbed in HeLa cells overexpressing monomeric red ﬂuorescent protein - tagged dominant - nega - tive Rab11 - FIP2 ( 129 - 512 ) . Bars , 10 (cid:3) m . J . T . Roland et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2832 data showed only minimal colocalization between Rab11a and Rab8a . Furthermore , there was no evidence that Rab11a was localized to large Rab8a - containing tubules . These re - sults indicate that two separate Myosin Vb / Rab complexes may exist and that each may regulate distinct trafﬁcking systems . To elucidate the relationship between Rab8a and Rab11a in vivo , we studied the movements of the two pro - teins in live cells . HeLa cells expressing Rab8a and Rab11a , tagged with either mCerulean or mVenus , were imaged in live cells by confocal microscopy . As we have observed with the endogenous proteins , Rab8a was localized to long tu - bules and small vesicles , whereas Rab11a resides strictly in fast - moving , small vesicles . We observed Rab11a - positive vesicles ( Figure 5 , red ) seeming to dock with and travel along Rab8a - positive tubules ( Figure 5 , green , and Supple - mental Video 1 ) . However , we did not observe discrete fusion or budding events . Our data indicate that Rab8a and Rab11a may not function in the same recycling pathway , but rather each is associated with distinct trafﬁcking pathways . Rab8a and Myosin Vb - Tail Localize to an EHD1 / EHD3 - positive Tubular Network The system of tubules with in which endogenous and ex - pressed Rab8a are localized strongly resembles the tubular recycling networks observed in EHD1 - and EHD3 - express - ing cells ( Caplan et al . , 2002 , Galperin et al . , 2002 ) . To deter - mine whether Rab8a colocalizes to the same network of tubules as these EHD proteins , HeLa cells were transfected with myc - tagged forms of either EHD1 or EHD3 . As re - ported previously ( Caplan et al . , 2002 , Galperin et al . , 2002 ) , these proteins associated with a large tubular network ( Fig - ure 6 , A – D ) . Rab8a was localized to these same tubules by using a speciﬁc rabbit polyclonal antibody ( Figure 6 , A and C ) . In addition , coexpression of ﬂuorescently tagged - Rab8a and either EHD1 or EHD3 conﬁrmed that all three colocal - ized in the same tubular network ( Supplemental Figure S4 ) . Nevertheless , although endogenous Rab11a was often ob - served in proximity to these tubules , it rarely colocalized with them ( Figure 6 , B and D ) . However , overexpression of EGFP - tagged Rab11a did partially colocalize with EHD1 and EHD3 as reported previously by Blume et al . ( 2007 ) ( Supplemental Figure S4 ) . To determine whether Myosin Vb tail can affect either EHD1 or EHD3 distribution , we transfected HeLa cells with the EGFP - tagged Myosin Vb tail construct . Both myc - EHD1 and myc - EHD3 distribution was altered in cells coex - pressing Myosin Vb tail ( Figure 7 , A and B ) . A perinuclear cisterna and fragmented tubular structures were observed for cells expressing both myc - EHD1 and EGFP - Myosin Vb tail ( Figure 7A ) . Similarly , Rab8a was redistributed to the Myosin Vb tail - containing perinuclear cisterna . Although myc - EHD3 distribution is also affected by Myosin Vb tail expression , it did not colocalize exactly with Myosin Vb tail , but rather it surrounded the perinuclear cisterna Figure 4 . Rab8a and Rab11a FRET with Myosin Vb tail . ( A and B ) FRET microscopy was performed on HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips , cotransfected with mCerulean - tagged Myosin Vb tail and mVenus - tagged Rab8a - WT , Rab8a - Q67L , Rab11a - WT , or Rab11a - S20V . The panels show representa - tive examples of cells used for FRET mea - surements collected by confocal microscopy by using a Zeiss LSM510 . mCerulean is pseudocolored with light blue and mVenus with yellow ; overlap is represented by green . The ﬂuorescence intensity of a photo - bleached ROI , indicated by a dashed line circle on the example cells , was measured before ( pre ) and after ( post ) photobleaching , and the average of prebleach images was compared with the average of the postbleach images after background subtraction . ( C ) The FRET efﬁciency was calculated as E (cid:3) 100 ( mCerulean post (cid:2) mCerulean pre ) / mCer - ulean post . FRET data were collected for 10 cells per experimental condition , and each experiment was repeated three times . As a control , the ﬂuorescence intensity of mCer - ulean - Myosin Vb tail expressed alone ( MVb - tail alone ) was measured both before and after photobleaching . Error bars indicate the SEM . The energy transfer efﬁciency between mCerulean - Myosin Vb tail and each of the mVenus - tagged Rab proteins was as follows : mVenus - Rab8a - WT , 15 . 1 (cid:6) 1 . 6 % ; mVenus - Rab8a - Q67L , 10 . 1 (cid:6) 1 . 1 % ; mVenus - Rab11a - WT , 15 . 6 (cid:6) 1 . 0 % ; and mVenus - Rab11a - S20V , 13 . 9 (cid:6) 1 . 1 % . All of these values are signiﬁ - cantly more positive then the measured value for mCerulean - Myosin Vb tail by itself ( 0 . 6 (cid:6) 1 . 0 % ) , indicating that both Rab8a and Rab11a are able to produce a positive FRET signal with Myosin Vb tail . Myosin Vb Interacts with Rab8a Vol . 18 , August 2007 2833 ( Figure 7B ) , indicating that Myosin Vb may not interact directly with this protein but rather regulate the transport or proper positioning of the tubular structures to which it localizes . Previous work has shown a role for EHD1 in the recycling of class I MHC molecules ( Caplan et al . , 2002 ) and that Rab8a colocalizes with MHC class I ( Hattula et al . , 2006 ) . Because Myosin Vb tail alters the distribution of both Rab8a and EHD1 , we sought to determine whether Myosin Vb tail could also disrupt class I MHC recycling . We observed class I MHC molecules colocalized with EGFP - Myosin Vb tail in transfected cells in an MHC internalization and recycling assay ( Figure 7C ) . Figure 7C illustrates that MHC class I molecules remained colocalized with Myosin Vb tail 120 min after the initialization of MHC internal - ization , compared with the weak , dispersed staining pat - tern seen in nontransfected cells . These results indicate that Myosin Vb participates in the recycling of MHC class I molecules . DISCUSSION The constant recycling of proteins between the plasma mem - brane and endocytic vesicles is a critical step in maintaining homeostasis of constituents of the cell surface . Investigations over the past two decades have detailed multiple pathways for endocytosis , including clathrin - dependent receptor - me - diated endocytosis , nonclathrin - dependent endocytosis , and caveolar endocytosis . In particular , although transferrin re - ceptor seems to use a clathrin - dependent pathway for internalization ( Johnson et al . , 1993 , Maxﬁeld and McGraw , 2004 ) , MHC class I protein and (cid:1) 1 - integrin are internalized through a nonclathrin - dependent pathway ( Radhakrishna and Donaldson , 1997 , Brown et al . , 2001 , Naslavsky et al . , 2004b ) . Far less is understood about the number of pathways for recycling of endocytosed proteins back to the plasma mem - brane . Many studies over the past several years have noted the association in nonpolarized cells of Rab11a with the regulation of transferrin receptor recycling ( Ullrich et al . , 1996 , Green et al . , 1997 , Wang et al . , 2000 ) . In contrast , recent studies have sug - gested an association of Rab8a with MHC class I recycling ( Hattula et al . , 2006 ) . Previous studies have not considered the relationship of critical regulators of these two recycling systems to each other . The present investigations demonstrate that My - osin Vb associates with both Rab11a and Rab8a . Nevertheless , the preponderance of data indicates that the trafﬁcking path - ways deﬁned by these two Rab proteins are substantially distinct . Myosin motors , especially class V motors , play critical roles in the proper trafﬁcking and positioning of many in - tracellular cargos . Increasing evidence suggests that myosin motors are used in multiple locations within cells dependent on cell - speciﬁc differentiated functions or stages of the cell cycle . The present investigations demonstrate that Myosin Vb is used in the same cell for regulation of two distinct trafﬁcking pathways . Although previous studies had estab - lished the role of Myosin Vb in Rab11a - mediated recycling ( Lapierre et al . , 2001 , Hales et al . , 2002 ) , yeast two - hybrid studies demonstrated that Rab8a could also interact with the tail region of Myosin Vb . This interaction was dependent on association of Rab8a with GTP and showed structural spec - iﬁcity , because Rab8b did not demonstrate any association with Myosin Vb . Most importantly , yeast - two hybrid stud - ies demonstrated that the structural requirements for Rab8a binding were signiﬁcantly different from Rab11a . Indeed , the binding requirements were most similar to those previ - ously reported for Rab11 - FIP2 association with Myosin Vb ( Lapierre et al . , 2001 ) . Therefore , association of Myosin Vb with either Rab11a - or Rab8a - containing membranes is not mediated exclusively by competition for a common binding site . Our studies have demonstrated that Myosin Vc can also interact with Rab8a but not Rab11a . As reported by Cheney and colleagues ( Rodriguez and Cheney , 2002 ) , expression of the tail of Myosin Vc caused accumulation of a subpopula - tion of Rab8a and transferrin receptor . The morphology of the Myosin Vc tail - containing membranes is markedly dif - ferent from that observed for Myosin Vb tail . It is therefore possible that Myosin Vc deﬁnes a further subspecialization of trafﬁcking . Although MHC class I molecules are trafﬁcked through a nonclathrin - dependent pathway , proteins such as the trans - ferrin receptor ( TrFR ) are primarily endocytosed by way of AP - 2 and clathrin - coated pits ( Johnson et al . , 1993 ) . Several recent investigations have demonstrated that regulators of Rab11a , including Rab11 - FIP2 and Myosin Vb , are required for the recycling of TrFR back to the plasma membrane through an endocytotic recycling compartment ( Lapierre Figure 5 . Rab11a vesicles are observed traveling along Rab8a tu - bules in vivo . HeLa cells expressing mCerulean - tagged Rab8a and mVenus - tagged Rab11a were analyzed by live cell confocal micros - copy . Sixty images were captured at roughly 7 - s intervals , and three of those images are shown here . The panels on the right show a zoomed - in view of the area boxed in each panel on the left . Arrow - heads indicate the position of a Rab11a - positive vesicle ( red ) as it travels along a Rab8a - positive tubule ( green ) . Bar , 10 (cid:3) m . These still images are representative of the full - length movie that is available as a Supplemental Video . J . T . Roland et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2834 et al . , 2001 , Hales et al . , 2002 , Lindsay and McCaffrey , 2002 ) . Overexpression of dominant - negative truncations of either Myosin Vb or Rab11 - FIP2 elicits a prominent inhibition of transferrin recycling ( Lapierre et al . , 2001 , Hales et al . , 2002 , Lindsay and McCaffrey , 2002 ) . The association of Rab8a with transferrin recycling has been controversial . Some investiga - tions have seen some colocalization of Rab8a with either internalized transferrin or Rab11a ( Rodriguez and Cheney , 2002 , Ang et al . , 2003 , Hattula et al . , 2006 ) . We have not observed any effect of expression of mCherry - chimeric forms of Rab8a WT or its GDP - bound or GTP - bound mu - tants on transferrin trafﬁcking by using a ﬂow cytometry - based assay ( data not shown ) . In contrast , in this same assay , expression of either Myosin Vb tail or truncations of Rab11 - FIP proteins elicits signiﬁcant decrements in transferrin recycling ( Jin and Goldenring , 2006 ) . Indeed , the present investigations using both high - resolution imaging and ma - nipulations with multiple transfected chimeras suggest that Rab11a and Rab8a deﬁne distinct trafﬁcking compartments . Importantly , although the expression of Myosin Vb tail caused accumulation of both Rab11a and Rab8a in a perinu - clear tubular cisterna , expression of Rab11 - FIP2 ( 129 - 512 ) only caused accumulation of Rab11a , and it had no effect on the localization of Rab8a . In addition , Myosin Vb tail caused the accumulation of class I MHC molecules into this same perinuclear tubular cisterna , supporting the idea that this motor is involved in two distinct recycling pathways . Nevertheless , because Myosin Vc can cause a clear alteration of the localization of a subset of Rab8a and the transferrin receptor , it is possible that the effects of Rab8a on transferrin trafﬁcking are mediated through Myosin Vc rather than Myosin Vb . In contrast to the ﬁndings on Rab11a , Rab8a seems to deﬁne a geographically and functionally separate recycling system . Rab8a localized to vesicular and tubular elements that were distinct from Rab11a - containing vesicles . Al - though various manipulations can cause tubulation of the Rab11 - containing recycling membranes ( Wang et al . , 2001 ) , these tubules have a substantially different structure from the tubules demonstrated with Rab8a . In addition , although EHD1 and EHD3 both colocalized extensively with Rab8a , we only rarely observed Rab11a association with Rab8a and with either EHD protein , although EHD1 and EHD3 interact with the Rab - binding proteins Rabenosyn - 5 Figure 6 . Rab8a localizes to a tubular net - work containing EHD1 and EHD3 . ( A ) HeLa cells expressing myc - tagged EHD1 were la - beled with an anti - myc mAb ( 9E10 ) and an anti - Rab8a rabbit polyclonal antibody fol - lowed by Cy3 - labeled rabbit and Alexa 488 - labeled mouse secondary antibodies . Confocal microscopy revels that the tubular localization of endogenous Rab8a exactly matches that of myc - EHD1 . Bar , 5 (cid:3) m . ( B ) In contrast to Rab8a , endogenous Rab11a ( labeled with VU57 ) does not colocalize with myc - EHD1 in transfected cells . Bar , 5 (cid:3) m . ( C ) Similar to what is observed for myc - EHD1 , endogenous Rab8a colocalizes with myc - tagged EHD3 on a network of long tubules in expressing cells . Bar , 10 (cid:3) m . ( D ) Endogenous Rab11a and myc - EHD3 do not colocalize in expressing cells . Bar , 5 (cid:3) m . Myosin Vb Interacts with Rab8a Vol . 18 , August 2007 2835 ( Naslavsky et al . , 2004a ) and Rab11 - FIP2 ( Naslavsky et al . , 2006 ) . Nevertheless , one clear possibility is that Rab11a and Rab8a deﬁne different stages in series along a common re - cycling pathway . Such a possibility would be consistent with the common association of Myosin Vb with both Rab11a and Rab8a . Live cell studies did not reveal any clear fusion or budding events between Rab8a and Rab11a . Thus , it seems less likely that Rab8a - containing cisternae are obli - gate precursors for Rab11a - containing recycling vesicles . Even so , these dynamic studies do demonstrate that Rab11a - containing vesicles can travel through the cell in contiguity with Rab8a - containing elements . This associated movement may reﬂect a common use of microtubule highways for movement and tubulation . Still , it remains possible that transient interactions may occur . These interactions may be critical in providing alternative pathways for trafﬁcking in the case of pathway inhibition . Thus , transferrin receptor molecules whose Rab11a - mediated recycling path is blocked may be able to shunt into another recycling pathway con - taining either Rab8a or Rab4 ( Provance et al . , 2004 ) . In summary , the present studies demonstrate that Myosin V motors can inﬂuence multiple membrane recycling path - ways through their interactions with speciﬁc Rab proteins . Thus , Myosin Vb molecules may serve as either multifunc - tional motor proteins , or they could subsume distinct roles in different vesicle trafﬁcking pathways as either motors or cycling anchors to the actin cytoskeleton . Although we have previously used the Myosin Vb tail as a probe for trafﬁcking of plasma membrane proteins through Rab11a - containing recycling systems , the present studies suggest this mutant is a more general inhibitor of multiple recycling pathways . The integration of different Myosin V motors with Rab11a and Rab8a again suggests that Rab protein interactions with Myosin V motors likely deﬁne the assembly of multiprotein trafﬁcking complexes regulating speciﬁc aspects of mem - brane trafﬁcking .
