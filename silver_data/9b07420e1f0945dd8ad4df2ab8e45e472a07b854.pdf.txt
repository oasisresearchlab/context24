We used light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that IRSp53 is expressed throughout the adult rat brain .

Surprisingly , its organization within the PSD of spiny excitatory neurons of neocortex and hippocampus differed from that within spiny inhibitory neurons of neostriatum and cerebellar cortex . The present data support previous suggestions that IRSp53 is involved in postsynaptic signaling , while hinting that its signaling role may differ in different types of neurons . J . Comp .

INDEXING TERMS : dendritic spine ; PSD ; BAIAP2 ; Rho GTPase ; GABAergic neurons IRSp53 ( insulin receptor substrate p53 ; also known as BAIAP2 , brain - specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 - associated protein 2 ) concentrates in the brain , where it has been identified as a component of the biochemically defined postsynaptic density ( PSD ) fraction ( Abbott et al . , 1999 ) . IRSp53 is a member of the I - BAR group of BAR ( Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ) domain proteins , which can sense or induce membrane curvature ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . IRSp53 also acts as a signaling platform for Rho - GTPases ( Yeh et al . , 1996 ; Oda et al . , 1999 ; Choi et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , IRSp53 may serve as a physical linker between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton ( Scita et al . , 2008 ) . Certain IRSp53 alleles in humans have been linked to neurological problems such as attention - deficit / hyperac - tivity disorder , Gilles de la Tourette syndrome , and autism ( Paschou et al . , 2004 ; Ribases et al . , 2009 ; Toma et al . , 2011 ) , and its expression is selectively decreased in Alzheimer’s disease ( Zhou et al . , 2013 ) , but its func - tion in neurons remains unclear . In fibroblasts , IRSp53 has been shown to regulate Rac - dependent lamellipodia formation ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) and Cdc42 - dependent filo - podia formation ( Govind et al . , 2001 ; Krugmann et al . , 2001 ; Nakagawa et al . , 2003 ; Yamagishi et al . , 2004 ; Lim et al . , 2008 ) . These observations led to the hypothe - sis that IRSp53 might play a key role in dendritic spines , whose morphology is controlled by their actin cytoskele - ton . Accordingly , IRSp53 overexpression in cultured hip - pocampal neurons increases spine density , while acute knockdown ( or dominant - negative inhibition ) of IRSp53 decreases both the density and size of dendritic spines ( Choi et al . , 2005 ) . Surprisingly , however , no significant changes in the density or ultrastructure of dendritic spines were detected in mice lacking IRSp53 ( Kim et al . , 2009 ; Sawallisch et al . , 2009 ) , presumably reflecting the effects of compensatory mechanisms in the intact ani - mal . Nevertheless , spatial learning , novel object recogni - tion , and contextual fear - conditioning were impaired in these IRSp53 knockout mice ( Kim et al . , 2009 ; Sawal - lisch et al . , 2009 ) . To gain further insight into possible functions of IRSp53 in neurons , we studied its regional , cellular , and Grant sponsor : National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) ; Grant number : R01 NS039444 ( to R .

We show here that IRSp53 is expressed throughout the brain , concentrating in dendritic spines , where it is closely associated with the PSD . While IRSp53 dis - played a strong association with the PSD in spine - rich neurons from multiple brain regions , its organization within the synapses of spiny excitatory neurons of neo - cortex and hippocampus differed from that within spiny inhibitory neurons of neostriatum and cerebellar cortex , demonstrating intriguing organizational differences between PSDs in excitatory and inhibitory cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirteen male Sprague - Dawley rats ( 200 – 350 g , Charles River , Raleigh , NC ; five for light microscopy [ LM ] , three for gamma - aminobutyric acid [ GABA ] immu - nofluorescence and preembedding immunogold , and five for postembedding immunogold ) were used for this study . All procedures related to the care and treatment of animals were in accordance with institutional and National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) guidelines ; all animal - use protocols were reviewed and approved by the relevant Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Antibody specificity Table 1 provides a list of primary antibodies used in this study . To detect IRSp53 , we generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the full - length human protein ( aa 1 – 521 , H6 - IRSp53 ) ( Choi et al . , 2005 ) . This antibody rec - ognizes the two major IRSp53 bands previously reported ( Abbott et al . , 1999 ) ( migrating on immunoblot at apparent molecular weights of (cid:2) 58 and (cid:2) 53 kDa ) in brain samples from wildtype mice , but not from IRSp53 - knockout mice . Since the primary antibody was affinity - purified , preadsorption would not be informative . To verify method specificity for postembedding immuno - gold , we performed experiments in which primary anti - body was omitted , verifying that immunogold was nearly absent ( no more than 2 – 4 particles / grid square ) ; additionally , we performed experiments in which pri - mary antibody was replaced with normal rabbit serum ( see Results ) . To identify GABAergic synapses , we use a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against GABA conjugated to bovine serum albumin ( BSA ; clone 5A9 , cat . no . MAB316 , lot # 2080836 , Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . This antibody does not crossreact with other amino acids . Tissue preparation After inducing deep anesthesia with sodium pento - barbital ( 60 mg / kg , i . p . ) , rats were intracardially per - fused with 500 ml of fixative : 4 % freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer ( PB , 0 . 1 M , pH 7 . 4 ) for LM ; a mixture of 4 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in PB for LM labeling with GABA and preembedding electron microscopy ( EM ) ; or a mix - ture of 2 % paraformaldehyde and 2 % glutaraldehyde in PB for postembedding EM . Brains were sectioned at 50 l m and 100 l m on a Vibratome and collected in cold PB . Light microscopy Free - floating sections were permeabilized with 50 % ethanol ( in PB ) for 30 minutes , then incubated in 10 % normal donkey serum ( NDS ) . The primary antibody ( IRSp53 , 1 : 500 ) was then applied overnight . For immu - noperoxidase microscopy , sections were then incubated for 3 hours in biotinylated secondary antibody ( 1 : 200 ; Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) and for 1 hour in ExtrAvidin - peroxidase complex ( 1 : 5 , 000 ; Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) ; peroxidase was histochemically visualized with nickel - intensified diaminobenzidine . Proc - essed sections were mounted on gelatin - coated slides , air dried , and cleared with xylene before being coverslipped with D . P . X . mountant ( BDH Chemicals , Poole , UK ) . For immunofluorescence microscopy , antigenic sites were visualized with donkey IgG conjugated to Cy3 ( 1 : 200 , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . For double labeling , the second primary antibody ( 1 : 5 , 000 , mouse anti - GABA ) was applied overnight and visualized by a sec - ondary antibody conjugated to Cy5 ( 1 : 200 , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) or Alexa 488 ( 1 : 200 , Invitrogen , La Jolla , CA ) . Some sections were then counterstained TABLE 1 .

Control experiments , in which the primary antibodies were omitted , were performed to control for nonspecific binding of the secondary anti - body . Sections were examined with a Leitz DMR micro - scope ( Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) and a Leica SP2 confocal microscope . Brightfield and fluorescence large - scale images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope equipped with a Surveyor / Turboscan auto - mated tiling and imaging system for large area acquisi - tion ( Objective Imaging , Cambridge , UK ) and Retiga EXi color CCD camera ( Qimaging , Surrey , Canada ) as the detector . Electron microscopy For preembedding , free - floating sections were incu - bated in 1 % NaBH 4 for 15 minutes ( to quench free alde - hyde groups ) , and 1 . 5 % hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes ( to quench endogenous peroxidases ) . After blocking for 20 minutes in 10 % NDS , sections were incubated in primary antibody ( IRSp53 , 1 : 500 ) over - night . For preembedding immunoperoxidase staining , sections were then incubated for 3 hours in biotinylated secondary antibody ( 1 : 200 – 1 : 500 ; Jackson ImmunoRe - search ) and for 1 hour in ExtrAvidin - peroxidase complex ( 1 : 5 , 000 ; Sigma ) ; peroxidase was histochemically visual - ized using a standard DAB - nickel method ( Shu et al . , 1988 ) . For preembedding gold , sections were then incu - bated with biotinylated donkey antirabbit IgG ( 1 : 200 , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) , followed by 1 . 4 nm gold particles conjugated to streptavidin ( 1 : 100 ; Nanop - robes , Yaphank , NY ) . Sections were washed in 0 . 01 M Na acetate ( to remove phosphate and chloride ions ) , followed by silver enhancement with IntenSE - M ( Amer - sham Biosciences ) . Sections were then postfixed in 0 . 5 % osmium tetroxide in 0 . 1 M PB for 30 – 45 minutes and incubated with 1 % uranyl acetate in maleate buffer ( 0 . 1 M , pH 6 . 0 ) for 45 minutes . After dehydration , sec - tions were infiltrated with Spurr’s resin ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Hatfield , PA ) and flat - mounted between sheets of ACLAR fluoropolymer ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) within glass slides . Sixty - nanometer sections were cut , mounted on 200 mesh copper grids , and contrasted with uranyl acetate and Sato’s lead . For postembedding , 100 l m sections were pre - treated in 0 . 1 % calcium chloride in 0 . 1 M sodium ace - tate , rinsed , then cryoprotected in a graded series to 30 % glycerol in 0 . 1 M sodium acetate . Sections were quick - frozen in methanol chilled with dry ice . Freeze substitution in 4 % uranyl acetate in methanol was car - ried out with a Leica Automatic Freeze Substitution System ; after rinsing in methanol , section were infil - trated with Lowicryl HM - 20 , mounted between sheets of ACLAR supported by pieces of glass slide , and poly - merized with ultraviolet light . After polymerization , regions of interest were cut from the sections and glued to plastic blocks . Sections were cut at (cid:2) 70 – 90 nm with an ultramicrotome and collected on nickel grids , coated with Coat - Quick . Grids were pretreated for 15 minutes at 60 (cid:3) C in 0 . 01 M citrate buffer , pH 6 , rinsed in water , blocked in 1 % BSA in Tris - buffered saline with 0 . 005 % Tergitol NP - 10 , then incubated over - night at 21 – 24 (cid:3) C with the primary antibody ( IRSp53 , 1 : 200 or a mixture of IRSp53 , 1 : 200 , and GABA , 1 : 500 ) . Grids were rinsed , blocked in 1 % normal goat serum , and incubated in goat antibody to rabbit IgG F ( ab ) 2 conjugated to 10 - nm gold particles ( 1 : 20 , Ted Pella , Redding , CA ) or a mixture of goat antibody to mouse IgG F ( ab ) 2 conjugated to 10 - nm and goat anti - body to rabbit IgG conjugated to 20 - nm gold particles ( 1 : 20 , Ted Pella ) . Grids were then rinsed and counter - stained with 1 % uranyl acetate , followed by Sato’s lead . Image analysis To evaluate the distribution of labeling in different tis - sue compartments , we first collected random EM pho - tomontages ( each (cid:2) 10 3 10 l m ) from neuropil of the stratum radiatum from CA1 hippocampus on material processed for post - embedding immunogold labeling . Using ImageJ ( NIH , Bethesda , MD ) , we outlined all iden - tifiable spines , PSDs , presynaptic terminals , mitochon - dria , and dendritic shafts . Since these were from single sections , many profiles ( especially neuroglia and small axons and dendrites ) could not be unambiguously iden - tified and were grouped as " other . " To assess how much of the immunogold labeling might represent noise rather than authentic IRSp53 protein , we examined immunogold - processed material in which primary anti - body had been replaced with normal rabbit serum . As above , we collected random photomontages ( each (cid:2) 10 3 10 l m ) from neuropil of the stratum radiatum from CA1 hippocampus , again outlining all identifiable spines , PSDs , presynaptic terminals , mitochondria , and dendri - tic shafts . To compare labeling in GABA - positive and GABA - negative synapses in the different regions stud - ied , we performed double - labeling and counted all syn - apses from 10 random photomontages ( each (cid:2) 10 3 10 l m ) collected from each of neocortex , hippocampus , striatum , and cerebellum . To investigate the organization of immunogold label associated with the PSD of asymmetric synapses , we took measurements from 35 – 40 immunolabeled synap - ses for each of the four brain regions studied , from each of three animals . For quantitative analysis of A . C . Burette et al . 2166 The Journal of Comparative Neurology | Research in Systems Neuroscience immunogold particles at synapses we used ImageJ ( Schneider et al . , 2012 ) . To define the " axodendritic " position , the distance between the center of each gold particle and the outer leaflet of the postsynaptic mem - brane was measured . To define the " lateral " synaptic position of a gold particle , we measured the distance from each end of the PSD to a line drawn perpendicular to the synapse running through the center of the parti - cle ( Valtschanoff and Weinberg , 2001 ) . The normalized lateral position of each gold particle within the axoden - dritic peak ( from 2 10 nm to 1 50 nm from the postsy - naptic membrane ) was computed as L N 5 | ( a 2 b ) | / | ( a 1 b ) | , where a and b are tangential distances along the plasma membrane from the center of the gold parti - cle to the lateral edges of the synaptic specialization ; thus L N 5 0 for gold particles at the center of the PSD , and L N 5 1 for particles at its edge . RESULTS General distribution of IRSp53 IRSp53 protein was detected throughout the rat brain , largely confined to gray matter ( Fig . 1 ) . IRSp53 staining was strongest in the olfactory tubercle and lat - eral hypothalamus . It was also prominent in olfactory bulb , neocortex , hippocampus , caudoputamen , nucleus accumbens , and substantia nigra ( Fig . 1 ) . IRSp53 stain - ing was much weaker in globus pallidus , thalamus , and caudal brain stem . Because we wanted to explore the relationship of IRSp53 to dendritic spines , we focused our attention on spine - rich regions of the brain . In the neocortex , staining extended through all layers ( Fig . 2A ) . IRSp53 was detected in somata and den - drites , and in small puncta throughout the neuropil ( Figs . 3A – E ) . The somato - dendritic staining was most prominent in superficial layer II , while punctate staining was strongest in layer I . Some of the neuropil staining was clearly in large dendrites , much of it was in proc - esses too small for accurate identification . Counter - staining with NeuroTrace ( a fluorescent Nissl stain ) showed that while the majority of neuronal somata were immunopositive , a scattered subpopulation of small somata exhibited little or no staining ( arrows in Fig . 3A – D ) . Our suspicion that these might represent inhibitory interneurons was confirmed by double label - ing with GABA , which showed that GABA - positive somata were negative for IRSP53 ( arrows in Fig . 4A , B ) . In the hippocampus , IRSp53 staining was strongest in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 region of Ammon’s horn , followed by CA2 and CA3 ( Fig . 2D , E ) . In the den - tate gyrus , staining was strongest in somata of stratum granulosum and in small puncta in the stratum molecu - lare ( Fig . 3F , G ) . Staining in CA1 – 3 was found in the somata and apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons ( Fig . 3H , I ) . Punctate staining was present throughout the neuropil in both stratum radiatum and stratum oriens ( Fig . 3H , J ) . As in the neocortex , GABAergic somata were immunonegative for IRSp53 ( Fig . 4C , D ) . Staining in both neocortex and hippocampus was excluded from GABAergic neurons . However , GABAergic neurons are aspiny or sparsely spiny in these struc - tures , leading us to wonder whether IRSp53 is selec - tively associated with excitatory neurons , or instead with spiny neurons per se , regardless of their neuro - transmitter . To test this , we studied striatum and cere - bellar cortex , whose principal cells are richly - spiny GABAergic neurons . In the caudoputamen , IRSp53 staining was prominent in gray matter between fas - cicles of myelinated fibers , which themselves were devoid of staining ( Fig . 2F , G ) . Staining was strong in somata and dendrites of cells likely for their number , size , and distribution to be medium spiny neurons , and also in numerous puncta in the neuropil ( Fig . 5A – C ) ; double - labeling with GABA confirmed the identity of these cells ( data not shown ) . In the cerebellum , IRSp53 staining concentrated in the cortex . Only weak staining was found in the deep nuclei ( Fig . 2H , I ) , and little or no staining was found in the white matter . Within cerebellar cortex , scatted small somata in the molecular layer ( likely to represent local circuit neurons ) were positive , especially in rostral folia . The somata and large proximal dendrites of Pur - kinje cells were intensely stained ( Figs . 2H , 5D , E ) . Immunopositive puncta were found in both the molecu - lar and granule cell layers ( Fig . 5D – F ) . Figure 1 .

Burette et al . 2168 The Journal of Comparative Neurology | Research in Systems Neuroscience In summary , IRSp53 was present throughout the brain , most prominently in regions rich in dendritic spines . At the cellular level , it concentrated mainly in spiny excitatory and inhibitory principal neurons . Subcellular organization We used electron microscopy to examine the subcel - lular location of IRSp53 . Immunostaining with DAB revealed small dark patches of label in the soma - Figure 3 .

In somata , label was often associated with the Golgi apparatus ; in den - dritic shafts , it seemed to associate with microtubules . Patches of labeling were occasionally found in dendritic spines , in some cases associated with the PSD ( Fig . 6E ) . Staining was not seen in myelinated fibers . To get a clearer understanding of the relationship of IRSp53 to intracellular organelles , we examined mate - rial processed for preembedding immunogold labeling , followed by silver intensification ( Fig . 6F – I ) . Intracellular labeling was observed in somata , where particles were associated with rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus , and large dendritic shafts , where it was typi - cally associated with microtubules ( Fig . 6F , G ) and also with poorly defined tubulo - vesicular endomembranous structures ( Fig . 6H ) . Gold / silver particles labeled den - dritic spines , but were rarely encountered in pretermi - nal axon segments or in synapses likely for their morphology to be inhibitory . In contrast to the pattern in dendritic shafts , labeling in spines often lay near the plasma membrane ( Fig . 6I ) . To verify our impression that labeling in dendrites was predominantly intracellular , we measured the posi - tion of 161 gold particles from randomly selected den - drites , taken from 10 low - magnification photomontages of neuropil ( 14 3 14 l m ) , in relationship to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 6J ) . Particles in dendritic shafts seemed fairly uniformly distributed within a band (cid:2) 0 . 7 m m from the membrane . However , this histogram might be mis - leading , since the data were drawn from dendrites of various diameters . Accordingly , we normalized the parti - cle distribution , such that 0 corresponded to a particle touching the membrane , and 1 to a particle lying in the center of the dendrite . This analysis confirmed that IRSp53 in dendrites had no clear affinity for the plasma membrane ( Fig . 6K ) . We used postembedding immunogold labeling to avoid problems of differential antibody access ; although less sensitive than preembedding methods , postembed - ding immunogold is generally considered to provide an unbiased estimate of antigen distribution . As with pre - embedding , postembedding gold labeled dendrites and somata , but was seldom detected over axons . However , labeling in spines was more common than with preem - bedding methods ; this spine labeling was mainly associ - ated with the PSD ( Fig . 7 ) , consistent with published biochemical data that IRSp53 concentrates at the PSD . In contrast to the prominent label associated with presumed excitatory synapses , double labeling with GABA suggested that IRSp53 is rarely expressed in syn - aptic contacts made by GABAergic terminals ( Fig . 8 ) . To evaluate this difference quantitatively , we counted all synapses in random fields from the four neuroanatomi - cal regions . Overall , excitatory synapses were roughly 10 times more likely to express IRSp53 in a single sec - tion than were GABAergic synapses , although the ratio varied somewhat in different brain regions ( Table 2 ) . Approximately 1 = 4 of excitatory synapses in neocortex , Figure 4 . Double labeling for IRSp53 and GABA in neocortex ( A , B : layer V ) , and hippocampus ( C , D : CA1 field ) .

Burette et al . 2170 The Journal of Comparative Neurology | Research in Systems Neuroscience hippocampus , and cerebellar cortex displayed labeling , in contrast to nearly 1 = 2 of excitatory synapses in stria - tum ( Table 2 ) . The numerical value of this labeling can - not be readily interpreted , since it greatly underestimates the true content of IRSp53 protein ( in part because antigen can only be detected by postem - bedding methods at the very surface of the thin sec - tion ) , but the relative enrichment of labeling in striatum may be significant . Quantification of label density in different tissue com - partments showed that label was (cid:2) 30 - fold enriched over the PSD ( Table 3 ) . To ensure that this preferential PSD labeling reflected the distribution of antigen , rather than simply arising from some nonspecific affinity to the protein - rich environment of the synapse , we per - formed experiments in which the primary antibody was replaced by normal rabbit serum , finding in this case that label was only marginally enriched over the PSD , in contrast to strong enrichment over mitochondria ( Table 3 ) . The ratiometric data also support that most of the label detected within spine cytoplasm and pre - synaptic terminals , although present at far lower den - sities than at the PSD , reflects authentic IRSp53 . These ratios likely overestimate nonspecific background , since to allow quantification of PSD labeling with normal serum as substitute for primary antibody , we had to increase its concentration to levels that gave excessive overall labeling . Organization at the synapse Quantitative analysis confirmed our qualitative impression from preembedding that label in spines was often close to the plasma membrane . In fact , we found that more than 80 % of gold particles representing IRSp53 in dendritic spines ( 337 of 417 particles ) lay within 30 nm of the membrane . This labeling showed a clear association with the PSD . To assess the Figure 5 . Immunofluorescence labeling for IRSp53 in neostriatum ( A – C ) , and cerebellar cortex ( D – F ) .

IRSp53 in the rat brain The Journal of Comparative Neurology | Research in Systems Neuroscience 2171 organization of IRSp53 in the vicinity of the PSD quanti - tatively , we measured the axodendritic distribution of gold particles lying within the lateral borders of the syn - aptic specialization . At the synapse , IRSp53 immuno - gold particle density along the axo - dendritic axis was maximal over the PSD , with a peak (cid:2) 20 nm inside the postsynaptic membrane ; labeling density diminished rapidly outside the postsynaptic plasma membrane and also within the cytoplasmic matrix of the spine ( Fig . 9A – D ) . To determine whether IRSp53 is uniformly distributed tangentially along the PSD , we computed the " normal - ized lateral position " ( L N ) of gold particles along the membrane ( lying within a window between 2 10 nm and 1 50 nm from the postsynaptic plasma membrane ; see Materials and Methods , and diagram at the bottom Figure 6 .

Burette et al . 2172 The Journal of Comparative Neurology | Research in Systems Neuroscience of Fig . 9 ) . For all regions examined , labeling was strongly associated with the PSD , declining abruptly at its edge . However , in spines from the neocortex and CA1 hippocampus but not striatum and cerebellum , IRSp53 concentrated at the center of the synapse ( Fig . 9E , F ) , a distribution reminiscent of that previously reported for N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors ( Kharazia and Weinberg , 1999 ; Takumi et al . , 1999 ) . To assess whether these distributions could have arisen by chance , we used chi - square statistics with 4 degrees of freedom ( reflecting five bins within the border of the synaptic specialization in Fig . 9E , F ) to assess signifi - cance . For both neocortex and hippocampus , the distri - bution of particles among the five bins was significantly different from a uniform distribution ( neocortex , P < 0 . 001 , n 5 102 synaptic particles ; CA1 , P < 0 . 01 , n 5 69 particles ) . In contrast , in spines from striatum and cerebellum IRSp53 was rather uniformly distributed along the synapse ( striatum , P > 0 . 6 , n 5 106 synaptic particles ; cerebellar cortex , P > 0 . 5 , n 5 85 particles , Fig . 9G , H ) . We computed the mean L N of all particles in this axo - dendritic window that lay within the borders of the PSD for each anatomical region , finding mean values of 0 . 38 6 0 . 03 for both neocortex and hippocampus , and 0 . 47 6 0 . 03 for both striatum and cerebellar cortex . A Wilcoxon rank - sum test revealed that the distribution of synaptic particles in hippocampus was not significantly different from that in neocortex ( P > 0 . 9 ) , whereas the distributions in striatum and cerebellum differed from that in neocortex ( P < 0 . 02 for both ) . We also computed an " edge - to - center " ratio ( defined as the number of particles within the limits of the PSD with L N > 0 . 5 , divided by the number of particles with L N < 0 . 5 ) . We found the edge - to - center ratio for neocor - tex to be 0 . 49 , and hippocampus , 0 . 53 ; whereas the ratio for striatum was 0 . 95 , and cerebellar cortex , 0 . 98 , confirming that PSD - associated particles in neocortex and hippocampus concentrate at the center of the syn - apse , but were quite uniformly distributed along the synapse in striatum and cerebellar cortex . DISCUSSION We here provide the first detailed report of the dis - tribution of IRSp53 protein in the adult brain . We find that the protein is expressed throughout the gray matter , especially in regions rich in spiny neurons , where it concentrates at the PSD . Our results sug - gest that IRSp53 is a core component of dendritic spines . Figure 7 . Postembedding labeling for IRSp53 ( arrows point to 10 nm gold particles ) .

IRSp53 in the rat brain The Journal of Comparative Neurology | Research in Systems Neuroscience 2173 IRSp53 and insulin receptors IRSp53 can participate in a variety of pathways , including insulin signaling itself . Insulin may play an important regulatory role in the brain , where it has been proposed to modulate synaptic plasticity ( Dou et al . , 2005 ) . While the functional significance of insulin and insulin - like growth factors in the brain remains unclear ( Zhao et al . , 1999 ; Banks et al . , 2012 ; Ghasemi et al . , 2013 ) , insulin receptors have been linked to a variety of physiological functions , including appetite reg - ulation , fertility and reproduction , and learning and memory ( Chiu and Cline , 2010 ; Banks et al . , 2012 ) . Activation of the insulin receptor promotes formation of Figure 8 . Postembedding double labeling for IRSp53 ( 20 nm gold particles ) and GABA ( 10 nm particles ) . IRSp53 labeling was often seen at postsynaptic sites of synapses likely , for their thickened postsynaptic density and GABA immunonegativity , to be glutamatergic ( blue pseudocolored profiles ) , but rarely postsynaptic to GABAergic terminals ( pink ) .

Burette et al . 2174 The Journal of Comparative Neurology | Research in Systems Neuroscience dendritic spines ( Lee et al . , 2011 ) , and has been shown to regulate the density of synapses in the developing visual system ( Chiu et al . , 2008 ) . At the molecular level , insulin receptors may play an important role in regula - tion of intracellular trafficking , and surface expression of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors ( Wan et al . , 1997 ; Liao and Leonard , 1999 ; Wang and Linden , 2000 ; Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Man et al . , 2000 ; Passafaro et al . , 2001 ; Skeberdis et al . , 2001 ; Huang et al . , 2003 , 2004 ; Chiu et al . , 2008 ) . Autoradiography and in situ hybridization ( Havrankova et al . , 1978 ; Werther et al . , 1987 ; Marks et al . , 1990 ) reveal especially high levels of the insulin receptor in the olfactory bulb , neocortex , hypothalamus and hippo - campus ; and moderate expression in striatum and cere - bellum ; but only weak expression in the thalamus . Interestingly , these results correspond to the regional distribution of IRSp53 we find in the present study . Moreover , the b - subunit of the insulin receptor has also been found in synaptosome and PSD fractions ( Abbott et al . , 1999 ) . Taken together , these data raise the pos - sibility that IRSp53 may be a key element of an insulin receptor signaling system at the synapse . IRSp53 and dendritic morphology Experiments in cultured neurons show that IRSp53 can regulate dendritic branching . These effects may be related to the ability of IRSp53 , as an I - BAR protein , to sense and / or modify membrane curvature ( Ahmed et al . , 2010 ) . If so , one would expect to see the protein associated with the plasma membrane , but in fact we found that IRSp53 in dendrites was seldom close to the membrane . Moreover , we saw no evidence of antigen accumulation at zones of high curvature ( e . g . , dendritic branches and junctions with spine necks ) . However , label did associate with small membrane - bound tubules within dendritic shafts ; these structures might be impor - tant for dendritic development and branching . In any case , the large majority of IRSp53 in dendrites was cytoplasmic and associated with filaments , likely representing protein in transit . Since the protein can move quickly from dendrites to spines in response to neuronal activity ( Hori et al . , 2005 ) , we speculate that IRSp53 in dendritic shafts may represent a reserve pool ( although it remains possible that the protein may have a specific function in dendrites ) . In contrast , IRSp53 in spines was associated with the membrane , and thus is Figure 9 . Synaptic distribution of immunogold labeling . A – D : Histograms in the upper row show the distribution of immunolabeling in the axo - dendritic axis ( 20 nm bins ) ; light gray bars represent labeling outside the plasma membrane of the spine . The pattern of labeling was gener - ally consistent for cortex ( A ) , hippocampus ( B ) , striatum ( C ) , and cerebellum ( D ) , peaking (cid:2) 20 nm inside the postsynaptic plasma membrane . E – H : Histograms in the lower row show distribution of label tangentially along the synapse , normalized such that 0 corresponds to the center of the PSD , and 1 . 0 to its edge ( see diagram at bottom ) . While restricted to the synapse for all regions examined , labeling in cortex and hip - pocampus ( E , F ) concentrated at the center of the PSD , whereas labeling in striatum and cerebellum ( G , H ) spread uniformly along the PSD . Y - axis for each histogram is normalized so that the largest bin corresponds to 1 . 0 units , and the origin corresponds to zero . IRSp53 in the rat brain The Journal of Comparative Neurology | Research in Systems Neuroscience 2175 suitably positioned to modulate spine shape . This would be consistent with current views that morphologic plas - ticity in the adult is far more prominent in spines than dendritic shafts . IRSp53 and the postsynaptic density Our postembedding EM analysis documents that IRSp53 in the adult brain is highly concentrated at the PSD , as previously suggested by biochemical fractiona - tion studies . These data are consistent with biochemi - cal evidence that IRSp53 can bind to several key PSD scaffold proteins , including PSD - 95 ( via its PDZ motif ) and Shank ( via its SH3 domain ) ; in fact , IRSp53 has been proposed to act as a bridge between these two proteins ( Soltau et al . , 2002 ; Bockmann et al . , 2002 ; Choi et al . , 2005 ) . This proposal is consistent with the present data showing that IRSp53 ( mean axodendritic position 16 . 9 6 0 . 7 nm cytoplasmic to the postsynap - tic membrane ) lies between PSD - 95 ( previously reported axodendritic position 11 . 9 6 1 . 2 nm ) and Shank ( 24 . 1 6 1 . 7 nm ) ( Valtschanoff and Weinberg , 2001 ) . Interestingly , the Rho protein CDC42 , impli - cated in regulation of spine shape , has been shown to regulate formation of this IRSp53 trimeric complex ( Soltau et al . , 2004 ) . Accordingly , we suggest that IRSp53 may link postsynaptic signal transduction to actin remodeling . Regional differences in the distribution of IRSp53 along the synapse IRSp53 was expressed at high levels in brain regions rich in spiny neurons . Although often pre - sumed to represent a uniform population , dendritic spines from different types of neurons can differ in ultrastructure and protein composition , and may employ distinct signaling pathways ( Petralia et al . , 1994 ; Harris and Weinberg , 2012 ; O’Rourke et al . , 2012 ) . For example , proteomic analysis shows impor - tant molecular differences between forebrain and cere - bellar PSDs ( Cheng et al . , 2006 ) . The present results show that IRSp53 in the pyramidal cells of neocortex and hippocampus concentrated at the center of the PSD , whereas IRSp53 in the spiny inhibitory neurons of neostriatum and cerebellar cortex distributed uni - formly along the synapse . These regional differences in the tangential organization of IRSp53 within the PSD further support the notion that dendritic spines are not uniform across brain regions . As a modular protein with multiple binding domains , IRSp53 may be involved in a variety of protein com - plexes participating in distinct signaling pathways . Accordingly , the differences we detected in IRSp53 localization may be related to different synaptic func - tions . As mentioned above , IRSp53 can bind both PSD - 95 and Shank , key elements of the NMDA receptor sig - naling complex ( Husi et al . , 2000 ; Dosemeci et al . , 2007 ) . Moreover , the tangential distribution profile of IRSp53 we found in cortex and hippocampus closely resembles that previously reported for NMDA receptors ( Kharazia and Weinberg , 1999 ; Takumi et al . , 1999 ) . These data , along with recent evidence that IRSp53 may play a direct role in regulating NMDA receptors and / or their numbers at the PSD , implicate IRSp53 as a component of the NMDAR signaling complex in cortex and hippocampus . In contrast , in Purkinje cells , which contain little NMDA receptor ( Petralia et al . , 1994 ; Cheng et al . , 2006 ) , IRSp53 was more uniformly distrib - uted . IRSp53 has been shown to bind to the multifunc - tional actin - bundling protein espin ( also enriched in the PSD ) , a protein only expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells ( Sekerkova et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , IRSp53 in Purkinje cells may be part of a distinct molecular complex . In summary , while the functional significance of IRSp53 in the adult brain remains unclear , the present evidence suggests that it acts mainly at the PSD , that it may play a role in the insulin signaling system , and that it may play different roles in different synapses .
