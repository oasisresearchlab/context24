To better understand the mechanisms causing this muscle deterioration in type 2 diabetes , we assessed muscle weight , exercise capacity , and biochemistry in db / db and TallyHo mice at prediabetic and overtly diabetic ages . Maximum running speeds and muscle weights were already reduced in predia - betic db / db mice when compared with lean controls and more severely reduced in the overtly diabetic db / db mice . In contrast to db / db mice , TallyHo muscle size dramatically increased and maximum running speed was maintained during the progression from prediabetes to overt diabetes . Analysis of mechanisms that may contribute to de - creased muscle weight in db / db mice demonstrated that insulin - dependent phosphorylation of enzymes that promote protein synthesis was severely blunted in db / db muscle . In addition , prediabetic ( 6 - wk - old ) and diabetic ( 12 - wk - old ) db / db muscle exhibited an increase in a marker of proteasomal protein degradation , the level of polyubiquiti - nated proteins . Chronic treadmill training of db / db mice improved glucose tolerance and exercise capacity , reduced markers of protein degradation , but only mildly increased muscle weight . The differences in muscle phenotype between these models of type 2 diabetes suggest that insulin resistance and chronic hyperglycemia alone are insufﬁ - cient to rapidly decrease muscle size and function and that the effects of diabetes on muscle growth and function are animal model - depen - dent . sarcopenia ; ubiquitin AS HUMANS AGE , IT IS COMMON for skeletal muscle mass and function to deteriorate ( 14 , 22 , 36 ) . When muscle loss pro - gresses to a pathological extreme , it is termed “sarcopenia” and contributes to physical disability ( 22 ) and prolonged hospital - izations ( 49 ) . Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) is associated with an accelerated loss of muscle mass and function in the elderly ( 36 , 37 ) , leading to increased prevalence of clinical sarcopenia among those with T2DM . This decrease in muscle function may contribute to the 400 % increased risk for major falls ( 31 ) , hip fractures ( 31 , 56 ) , increased prevalence and severity of physical disability ( 11a , 15 , 37 , 44 ) , and prolonged hospitalizations associated with diabetes ( 28 ) . The effects of diabetes on human skeletal muscle have been best studied in older adults in which annual loss of muscle mass is (cid:2) 26 % greater and annual loss of muscle strength is (cid:2) 33 % greater in diabetic individuals compared with those without diabetes ( 14 , 27 , 36 , 37 , 61 ) . Current treatments of muscle atrophy in diabetes are limited to standard diabetic medications , improved diet , exercise , and hormonal replace - ment ( 32 ) . Treatment of diabetes is partially effective in mitigating diabetic muscle loss ; a longitudinal study in patients ( 60 – 70 yr old ) using dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry found that nondiabetic individuals lost 193 g of muscle / yr , diagnosed diabetic ( presumably treated ) individuals lost 293 g of muscle / yr , and undiagnosed diabetic ( untreated ) individuals lost 435 g of muscle / yr ( 36 ) . Radioisotope - based studies in humans indi - cate that accelerated muscle loss in patients with diabetes is caused by net protein loss associated with increased rates of muscle protein degradation ( 5 , 16 ) but normal rates of meal - induced muscle protein synthesis ( 30 ) . Beyond increased pro - tein loss in diabetic humans , our understanding of diabetic muscle loss relies largely on rodent models of diabetes melli - tus . Streptozotocin - induced type 1 diabetic ( T1DM ) mice are the best understood model of diabetic muscle atrophy in which pharmacologically induced insulin deﬁciency leads to in - creased muscle proteasomal protein degradation and rapid muscle atrophy ( 39 ) . Insulin - dependent signaling pathways are clearly important in this model , since insulin restoration ( 40 ) or phosphatase and tensin homolog ablation ( 18 ) are sufﬁcient to rescue and prevent muscle atrophy . Blockade of glucocorticoid signaling is also sufﬁcient to prevent muscle atrophy in strep - tozotocin mice , suggesting a role of glucocorticoids in diabetic muscle atrophy ( 19 ) . Although convincing , these studies in T1DM mice are limited because T1DM ( primary insulin deﬁ - ciency ) only accounts for 5 – 10 % of cases of diabetes , with T2DM ( primary insulin resistance ) accounting for the remain - ing 90 – 95 % of cases of diabetes mellitus ( 8 ) . Muscle atrophy in type 2 diabetic rodent models is less consistent ; several models exhibit no change or mild decreases in muscle size [ i . e . , high - fat diet ( 50 , 60 , 65 ) , muscle insulin receptor knockout ( 12 ) , insulin receptor substrate ( IRS ) - 1 knockout ( 29 ) , and IRS - 2 knockout ( 29 ) ] , whereas several models demonstrate severely reduced muscle size [ leptin deﬁ - cient ( ob / ob ) ( 24 , 53 , 63 ) , leptin receptor deﬁcient ( db / db ) ( 62 ) , muscle speciﬁc IRS - 1 / IRS - 2 knockout ( 29 ) ] . The most detailed rodent studies of type 2 diabetic muscle atrophy have focused on the ob / ob and db / db mouse models . The ob / ob mouse ( leptin mutant ) is hyperphagic , severely obese ( 20 ) , hyperinsulinemic , and hyperglycemic ( 58 ) . The adult ob / ob mouse has severely reduced weight of fast and mixed skeletal muscles compared with age - matched wild - type ( WT ) controls but has normal slow ( soleus ) muscle weight ( 24 , 53 , 63 ) .

Functionally , ob / ob muscle maintains WT levels of whole muscle and single ﬁber force production when normalized to CSA but demon - strates decreased rates of relaxation and premature fatigue during induced tetanus compared with WT ( 7 ) . Reduced sat - ellite cell proliferation during early postnatal development ( 41 ) and in response to chemical injury ( 33 ) has been reported in ob / ob mice . Although leptin administration in adult ob / ob mice normalizes glycemia ( 46 ) and partially restores muscle mass ( 45 ) , pair feeding adult ob / ob mice does not improve muscle mass ( 45 ) , despite a moderate lowering of blood glucose levels ( 46 ) . The db / db mouse ( leptin receptor mutant ) metabolic pheno - type is similar to the ob / ob mouse , presenting with hyperpha - gia , juvenile - onset obesity , and diabetes ( 9 ) . Depending on background genetic strain , db / db mice exhibit pancreatic islet hyperplasia [ C57BL / 6J ( 13 ) ] or islet atrophy [ C57BL / KsJ ( 23 ) ] ; pancreatic islet atrophy results in a more severe diabetic phenotype , late - onset weight loss , and a shortened lifespan compared with ob / ob mice . db / db mice also exhibit reduced skeletal muscle size , increased muscle protein degradation , elevated proteasome function , and reduced muscle ﬁber CSA ( 62 ) . Glucose intolerance and reduced muscle size in db / db mouse is partially normalized by chronic rosiglitazone treat - ment , suggesting a role of metabolism in the reduced muscle size ( 62 ) . Taken together , these previous ﬁndings suggest that T2DM is associated with fast glycolytic skeletal muscle loss that is partially reversed by interventions that improve metabolism [ such as rosiglitazone in db / db mice ( 62 ) , leptin in ob / ob mice ( 45 ) , or antidiabetic treatment in humans ( 36 ) ] . The ability of insulin to completely rescue muscle atrophy in T1DM mice ( 40 ) suggests that decreased insulin signaling could directly cause muscle loss in T2DM . Canonical insulin signaling pro - motes protein synthesis [ via protein kinase B ( Akt ) / mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) ] and inhibits protein degradation [ via Akt / forkhead box O ( FOXO ) signaling ] ( 57 ) ; it is logical that insulin resistance could reduce protein synthesis and in - crease protein degradation . However , it is unclear if decreased insulin signaling in T2DM directly causes muscle loss or if other diabetes - associated factors drive muscle atrophy . Indeed , the onset , progression , biochemical phenotype , and causative signaling pathways for muscle loss in T2DM remain unclear . Therefore , to better understand the progression and causal mechanisms of muscle atrophy in T2DM , we compared muscle growth / loss in both the well - characterized db / db and the less - characterized TallyHo mouse models of T2DM . The TallyHo model was studied because it is a polygenic model of overt T2DM with intact leptin signaling . Moreover , TallyHo mice develop diabetes at a mature age , allowing us to investigate the impact of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia on mature muscle , which is more clinically relevant compared with the juvenile onset of diabetes in db / db mice . We also studied how a common treatment for diabetes ( chronic exercise ) affects muscle size , glucose tolerance , and markers of muscle protein synthesis and degradation in db / db mice . We hypothesized that delineating the onset of muscle atrophy in these models of T2DM as well as the effects of exercise would help clarify which components of the diabetic phenotype are sufﬁcient to cause muscle loss in T2DM . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Animals Male db / db ( BKS . Cg - Dock7m (cid:3) / (cid:3) Leprdb / J ) , age - matched WT con - trols ( C57BLKS / J ) , and TallyHo ( TallyHo / JngJ ) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories ( Bar Harbor , ME ) . Because TallyHo mice were originally created at Jackson Labs by selective crossbreeding of multiple strains of mice , no accurate control strain of mice exists to compare with TallyHo mice ( 26 ) . To overcome this challenge , 8 - wk - old TallyHo mice were studied to establish a prediabetic baseline to compare with the 22 - to 24 - wk - old overtly diabetic TallyHo mice . Obesity was induced in select WT C57BLKS / J mice by providing a high - fat diet ( HFD , 4 . 73 kcal / g , 45 % kcal from fat ; D12451 ; Research Diet , New Brunswick , NJ ) from the age of 8 wk until their death at 20 wk old , whereas all other mice were fed standard chow diet ( 3 . 0 kcal / g , 4 . 25 % kcal from fat ) , as described previously ( 4 ) . Male mice only were used because of the relatively homogeneous metabolic phenotype of males compared with females in the db / db and TallyHo mouse models . The mice were maintained on a 12 : 12 - h light - dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water , except when fasted ( described below ) . Mice were killed by CO 2 exposure . All animal experiments were approved by The Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Glucose Tolerance Test After an overnight fast ( db / db mice ) or 6 - h fast ( TallyHo mice ) , fasting blood glucose levels were measured using tail blood in a TRUEtrack blood glucose monitoring kit ( Walgreens , Columbus , OH ) . The maximum physical limit of the glucometer was 33 . 3 mM ; glucose levels (cid:4) 33 . 3 mM ( reading as “HI” ) were treated as 33 . 3 mM for facility of quantitative data comparison . An injection of glucose ( 2 g / kg ip ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , dissolved in Dulbecco’s phosphate - buffered saline ( DPBS ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , was given to each mouse , and blood glucose measurements were obtained at 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , and 240 min postinjection . Glucose tolerance tests were compared by calculating the integrated area under the curve ( AUC ) of the blood glucose level for the 240 min of the test . Measurement of Body Size and Muscle Weight Body weight was determined in a fed state . To determine muscle weight , after death by CO 2 inhalation , muscles were carefully dis - sected , and tendons were removed to the beginning edge of muscle tissue . Muscles were brieﬂy immersed in DPBS , dabbed on tissue paper to remove excess ﬂuid , weighed on a digital analytical balance , and then frozen in liquid nitrogen . Maximal Oxygen Consumption Treadmill Test Maximum cardiopulmonary function and running speeds were assessed using a Metabolic Modular Treadmill ( Columbus Instru - ments , Columbus , OH ) as described previously ( 55 ) , with several modiﬁcations to adapt to the poor exercise capacity of the db / db mice , as follows . Acclimation . Mice were acclimated to the treadmill 1 – 3 days before testing by being placed on an unmoving treadmill for 3 min , after which the shock grid was activated ( 3 Hz and 1 . 5 mA ) and the treadmill was engaged to a walking speed of 6 m / min for 5 min . Maximal oxygen consumption test . Mice were placed on the tread - mill ( 0° incline entire experiment ) , and the shock grid was activated . The treadmill speeds were then increased until exhaustion as follows : speed , duration , 0 m / min , 5 min ; 6 m / min , 5 min ; 7 , 8 , 9 , and 10 m / min , 30 s each ; 11 m / min , 1 min ; 12 , 13 , 14 , and 15 m / min , 2 min each ; and (cid:3) 1 m / min , each 1 min thereafter . Exhaustion ( endpoint for treadmill cessation ) was deﬁned as the point at which mice maintained continuous contact with the shock grid for 5 s . Maximal oxygen consumption ( V ˙ O 2max ) was determined by the peak oxygen consump - E593 EFFECTS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ON SKELETAL MUSCLE AJP - Endocrinol Metab • doi : 10 . 1152 / ajpendo . 00277 . 2013 • www . ajpendo . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on A ugu s t 28 , 2017 h tt p : / / a j pendo . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m tion reached during this test when the respiratory quotient was (cid:4) 1 . 0 . Maximum running speed was deﬁned as the treadmill speed at which V˙ O 2max was achieved . Voluntary Activity Measurements Mouse activity levels were measured using measurement of hori - zontal infrared beam breaks over the course of 24 h using an Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System at room temperature ( CLAMS ; Columbus Instruments ) . Grip Strength Test Forelimb grip strength was assessed using a digital Grip Strength Meter ( Columbus Instruments ) . Mice were lifted by their tails , al - lowed to grasp the forelimb pull bar , and pulled smoothly away from the transducer in the horizontal plane , and maximum force exerted on the transducer was recorded . This test was repeated in 3 sets of 10 attempts , with a 15 - min rest in between sets ; the maximum effort recorded from all attempts by each mouse was designated as maxi - mum grip strength . Insulin Acute Response Test To assess tissue - speciﬁc acute responses to insulin , basal tail blood glucose was assessed , and then recombinant human insulin ( Humulin , 0 . 2 U / g body wt ip ; Eli Lilly , Indianapolis , IN ) or DPBS was administered to select mice . Ten minutes after injection , tail blood glucose was assessed , the mice were immediately killed , and tissues were removed . Chronic Exercise Mice were exercised from 5 to 13 wk of age using the interval training method as described previously ( 55 ) , with slight modiﬁca - tions . Mice were treadmill exercised 80 min / day , 5 days / wk , for 8 wk . Training was performed on a 20° incline , alternating 4 min high speed and 2 min low speed ( high (cid:5) 80 – 90 % of speed at which V˙ O 2max was reached , slow (cid:5) 50 % of speed at which V˙ O 2max was reached ) . The V˙ O 2max tests for the exercised mice and their controls were performed as described above but with the following changes to speed / incline to determine appropriate training speeds for running on an incline : speed , duration , incline , 0 m / min , 5 min , 0° ; 6 m / min , 5 min , 0° ; 6 m / min , 2 min , 20° ; and (cid:3) 2 m / min , each 2 min thereafter , 20° . At the end of the study , mice were killed in a fed state 3 – 5 days after the last bout of exercise . No exogenous insulin was administered to the mice . Protein Quantiﬁcation Using Western Blotting Western blotting was carried out using standard techniques , as described previously ( 4 ) . Protein concentrations of total homogenate were determined by the Bradford method , and equivalent amounts of protein were loaded in each lane of the polyacrylamide gel . After electrophoresis , protein were transferred to 0 . 45 - (cid:6) M nitrocellulose membranes and stained with the Ponceau stain ( 0 . 1 % wt / vol Ponceau Red in 5 % acetic acid ) to visualize protein loading . Membranes were washed with Tris - buffered saline containing 0 . 5 % Tween 20 ( TBS - T ) and blocked for nonspeciﬁc binding [ room temperature ( RT ) , 2 h , 5 % ( wt / vol ) nonfat milk in TBS - T ] . Membranes were probed with pri - mary antibodies for eithe r 3 h at RT orovernight at 4°C , at the following dilutions : sarco ( endo ) plasmic reticulum Ca 2 (cid:3) - ATPase ( SERCA ) 1a , 1 : 5 , 000 , custom - made antibody ; SERCA2a , 1 : 5 , 000 , custom - made antibody ; (cid:7) - actin , 1 : 25 , 000 ; CSQ , 1 : 5 , 000 ; phospho - Akt , 1 : 2 , 000 ( pSer 473 , Clone D9E XP ; Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA ) ; Akt , 1 : 2 , 000 ; MuRF - 1 , 1 : 1 , 000 ( AP2041 ; ECM Bio - sciences , Versailles , KY ) ; atrogin - 1 , 1 : 1 , 000 ( MP3401 ; ECM Biosci - ences ) ; p - 4E - binding protein 1 ( 4EBP - 1 ) , 1 : 5 , 000 ( pThr 37 / 46 , Clone 236B4 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) ; p70S6K , 1 : 5 , 000 ( pThr 389 , Clone 108D2 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) ; pS6 , 1 : 5 , 000 ( pSer 235 / 236 , Clone D57 . 2 . 2E XP ; Cell Signaling Technology ) ; phospho - mTOR , 1 : 2 , 000 ( 2971S , pSer 2448 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) ; pFOXO1 , 1 : 1 , 000 ( pSer 256 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) ; anti - pan ubiquitin , 1 : 1 , 000 ( clone FK2 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) ; and anti - poly - ubiquitin , Lys 48 - speciﬁc , 1 : 5 , 000 ( clone Apu2 ; Millipore , Temecula , CA ) . After being washed with 0 . 05 % TBS - T , blots were probed with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase - linked secondary antibody for 1 h at RT and then washed again with 0 . 05 % TBS - T , developed with enhanced chemiluminescent substrate ( SuperSignal West Dura Chemiluminescent Substrate ; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Rockport , IL ) , and exposed to ﬁlm . Blots were scanned ( HP Imaging ) , and relative protein quantitation was performed by densitometry using the middle third of each band , normalizing by the relative intensity of the loading control bands ( (cid:7) - actin or Ponceau stain ) , using Image J analysis software ( National Institutes of Health ) ( 42 ) . Corticosterone and Inﬂammatory Cytokine Arrays Blood was collected from 16 - wk - old WT C57BLKS / j mice , 16 - wk - old db / db mice , and 8 - mo - old TallyHo mice between 0900 and 1000 in a fed state . Five minutes prewarming of the mice in a 37°C temperature - controlled cage was used to enhance tail blood ﬂow and facilitate rapid collection of adequate blood . Blood was collected in (cid:8) 2 min from the tail veins to minimize potential of handling - induced changes in glucocorticoid / inﬂammatory signaling . Serum was ana - lyzed for free corticosterone using a corticosterone ELISA kit ( ADI - 900 – 097 ; Enzo Life Sciences , Farmingdale , NY ) , following the manufacturer’s instructions . Relative levels of serum inﬂammatory proteins were determined using the Mouse Cytokine Antibody Array Panel A ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) , per the manufacturer’s instructions . Histology . Muscles ( n (cid:5) 2 – 5 ) were gently rinsed in DPBS , dabbed on tissue paper to remove excess moisture , and then stored in 10 % ( vol / vol ) formalin . Tissue was then parafﬁn embedded , cut , and stained with hematoxylin / eosin or the Masson - Trichrome stain using standard techniques . Images were obtained using a light microscope at (cid:9) 20 magniﬁcation ( Zeiss Axioskop 40 , Oberkochen , Germany ) . Fiber CSA was quantiﬁed using Axiovision LE software ( Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) , with at least 90 contiguous ﬁbers quanti - ﬁed per sample . Data Interpretation Statistically signiﬁcant data were identiﬁed by use of the two - sided Student’s t - test , (cid:7) (cid:5) 0 . 05 . All metabolic , functional , and biochemical tests were performed on at least three to four animals per condition . Western blots were repeated in at least duplicate . RESULTS A major objective of this study was to identify what com - ponents of the diabetic phenotype are necessary for muscle loss in type 2 diabetes . To this end , we took advantage of the type 2 diabetic male db / db and TallyHo mouse models , which exhibit overt type 2 diabetes at (cid:2) 8 and (cid:2) 14 wk of age , respectively ( 62 ) . We investigated the relationship of diabetic state to muscle mass and function by comparing mice at approximately prediabetic and overtly diabetic ages . Progression of Metabolic Phenotype in db / db Mice First , we conﬁrmed the development of the diabetic phenotype in db / db mice at 6 and 12 wk of age compared with age - matched WT controls . Total body weight in db / db mice was moderately elevated in 6 - wk - old mice and severely increased in 12 - wk - old mice compared with controls ( Fig . 1 A ) . Fasting blood sugar was mildly increased in 6 - wk - old ( 8 . 3 (cid:10) 0 . 6 mM WT vs . 13 . 8 (cid:10) 1 . 8 mM db / db , P (cid:8) 0 . 05 ) and severely increased in 12 - wk - old db / db E594 EFFECTS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ON SKELETAL MUSCLE AJP - Endocrinol Metab • doi : 10 . 1152 / ajpendo . 00277 . 2013 • www . ajpendo . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 4 on A ugu s t 28 , 2017 h tt p : / / a j pendo . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m mice compared with WT controls ( 6 . 3 (cid:10) 0 . 6 mM WT vs . 27 . 1 (cid:10) 2 . 8 mM db / db , P (cid:8) 0 . 05 ) . Glucose tolerance was moderately impaired in 6 - wk - old db / db mice ( AUC 38 . 1 (cid:10) 2 . 6 mM·h WT vs . 78 . 0 (cid:10) 9 . 3 mM·h db / db , P (cid:8) 0 . 05 ) but was more severely impaired in 12 - wk - old db / db ( AUC 37 . 7 (cid:10) 1 . 8 mM·h WT vs . 122 . 3 (cid:10) 5 . 7 mM·h db / db , P (cid:8) 0 . 05 ) mice ( Fig . 1 B ) . Fasted 12 - wk - old db / db mice exhibited elevated blood levels of total cho - lesterol , high - density lipoprotein , low - density lipoprotein , and triglyc - erides ( Fig . 1 C ) . These ﬁndings are consistent with what has been reported previously ( 9 ) . Based on these ﬁndings , we chose to study changes in db / db skeletal and cardiac muscle at prediabetic ( 5 – 6 wk old ) and “overtly diabetic” ( 12 – 13 wk old ) states . Decline of Exercise Capacity of db / db Mice The functional decline of cardiac and skeletal muscle was determined by assessing V˙ O 2max during forced treadmill running . No signiﬁcant impairment in maximum cardiac function ( V˙ O 2max ) was observed in 6 - wk - old prediabetic or 12 - wk - old overtly dia - betic db / db mice compared with age - matched WT controls ( 6 wk old 2 . 28 (cid:10) 0 . 01 ml O 2 / min WT vs . 2 . 54 (cid:10) 0 . 08 ml O 2 / min db / db ; 12 wk old 3 . 28 (cid:10) 0 . 18 ml O 2 / min WT vs . 3 . 04 (cid:10) 0 . 10 ml O 2 / min db / db , P (cid:4) 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 1 D ) . The maximum running speed was reduced by 34 . 6 % at 6 wk old and 64 . 1 % at 12 wk old ( 6 wk old 36 (cid:10) 1 m / min WT vs . 24 (cid:10) 1 m / min db / db ; 12 wk old 38 (cid:10) 1 m / min WT vs . 13 . 8 (cid:10) 0 . 9 m / min db / db , P (cid:8) 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 1 E ) . Depressed skeletal muscle functional capacity was conﬁrmed by measuring in vivo forelimb grip strength , which was reduced in 12 - wk - old db / db mice by 28 % compared with age - matched WT controls ( 1 . 27 (cid:10) 0 . 05 Newton WT vs . 0 . 92 (cid:10) 0 . 05 Newton db / db , P (cid:8) 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 1 E ) . Progression of Metabolic Phenotype TallyHo Mice The TallyHo male mouse is a leptin - intact , mature - onset , and polygenic ( 52 ) model of T2DM that develops reduced insulin - dependent muscle glucose uptake by 6 wk of age , whole body insulin resistance at (cid:2) 8 wk of age , and overt hyperglycemia at (cid:2) 16 wk of age ( 26 ) . Based on published literature ( 25 , 26 , 52 ) , we selected 8 - to 9 - wk - old and 22 - to 24 - wk - old TallyHo male mice to compare the muscle pheno - type at prediabetic and overtly diabetic stages , respectively .

Exercise Capacity of TallyHo Mice The exercise capacity of TallyHo mice did not decrease with the onset of overt diabetes ( Fig . 2 ) . Speciﬁcally , maximum cardiac capacity increased with age between the prediabetic 7 - wk - old and overtly diabetic 22 - wk - old TallyHo mice ( 3 . 07 (cid:10) 0 . 02 ml O 2 / min 7 wk old TallyHo vs . 3 . 68 (cid:10) 0 . 08 ml O 2 / min 22 wk old TallyHo ) ( Fig . 2 C ) . In addition , maximum running speed achieved during the tests was not signiﬁcantly different between the age groups ( 31 (cid:10) 1 m / min 7 wk old TallyHo vs . 29 . 5 (cid:10) 0 . 6 m / min 22 wk old TallyHo , P (cid:4) 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 2 D ) . Muscle Weight is Reduced Signiﬁcantly in db / db Mice but not in the TallyHo Mouse Model To understand the poor running speed and grip strength of db / db mice , muscle weight and histology were assessed . Hindlimb muscle size was visibly reduced in 6 - and 12 - wk - old db / db mice compared with WT controls ( Fig . 3 A ) . No increase in centrally located nuclei ( which would suggest muscle injury and regeneration ) was evident in db / db tibialis anterior muscle by histology ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . Wet muscle mass was decreased in predominantly fast - type skeletal muscle ( gastrocnemius , tibialis anterior , and extensor digitorum longus ) from predia - betic 6 - wk - old mice and more so in overtly diabetic 12 - wk - old mice . Notably , although the disparity between db / db and WT mice muscle weight increased with age , db / db muscle weight increased throughout this period , but at a much lower rate than WT controls . This suggests decreased muscle growth and not muscle loss as the cause of decreased db / db muscle weight . No signiﬁcant change was evident in db / db tibia length , cardiac weight , or soleus weight ( predominantly slow oxidative mus - cle ) compared with WT controls ( Table 1 ) . Average muscle ﬁber CSA was decreased in fast - type muscle ( tibialis anterior ) but not in slow oxidative muscle ( soleus ) ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) . On the other hand , TallyHo skeletal and cardiac muscle weight and tibia length increased from 9 wk of age to 24 wk of age mice despite glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia ( Table 1 ) . Comparison of Tallyho muscle weight with “healthy” muscle weight is limited to using prediabetic TallyHo because of the lack of available nondiabetic controls for TallyHo mice [ because of extensive crossbreeding between different strains to develop this polygenic model ( 26 ) ] . Moreover , average muscle weight and ﬁber CSA of both predominantly slow muscle ( soleus ) and fast muscle ( tibialis anterior ) were in - creased compared with C57BLK / s WT controls ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) . No evidence of increased centrally located nuclei was observed in TallyHo muscle by histology ( Fig . 3 B ) . Masson trichrome staining did not indicate increased ﬁbrosis in diabetic db / db or Tallyho tibialis anterior muscle ( Fig . 3 C ) . 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 B l ood G l u c o se ( m M ) Time ( min ) 8wo TallyHo 22wo TallyHo 0 10 20 30 40 50 7 11 15 19 23 B od y W e i gh t ( g ) Age ( weeks old ) TallyHo 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 22 7 Age ( Weeks ) TallyHo 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 22 7 Age ( Weeks ) TallyHo * * * * A C B D V O 2 m ax ( m l O 2 / m i n ) (cid:129) R unn i ng s p e e d du r i ng V O 2 m ax ( m / m i n ) (cid:129) Fig . 2 .

A single intraperitoneal injection of insulin in overnight - fasted mice acutely increased phosphorylation of proteins key to activating protein synthesis ( Akt , mTOR , 4EBP - 1 , p70S6K , and S6 proteins ) . Basal levels of phosphorylation of these proteins was generally slightly greater in WT mice , with the exception of 4EBP - 1 , which demonstrated greater basal phosphorylation in db / db muscle compared with muscle from WT mice ( Fig . 4 ) . Upon stimulation with insulin , WT mice displayed a robust increase in phosphorylation of these protein synthetic pathways in tibialis anterior , diaphragm , and ventricular muscle , with the exception of mTOR in the diaphragm . In db / db mice , insulin - dependent phosphorylation of these regulators of protein syn - thesis , although evident , was markedly reduced in slow / mixed ( diaphragm ) , fast ( tibialis anterior ) , and cardiac muscle . These data expand upon previous literature ( 47 ) and demonstrate that insulin - dependent activation of pathways regulating protein synthesis is blunted in muscles of adult db / db mice . Although the single intraperitoneal insulin bolus was sufﬁcient to acti - vate insulin - dependent signaling pathways 10 min after insulin injection , no signiﬁcant reduction of blood glucose concentra - tions in WT or db / db mice occurred during this time ; this may indicate that , although some intracellular pathways are acti - vated at this time point , glucose transport has not been in - creased sufﬁciently to alter blood glucose concentrations . Increased Ubiquitinated Proteins and Atrophy - Associated E3 Ubiquitin Ligases in Diabetic Muscle We next studied the role of proteasomal protein degradation in decreased muscle size and function in db / db mice . Previous literature has shown protein degradation rates and 26S protea - some function to be elevated in muscle from 9 - wk - old db / db mice ( 62 ) . We examined how increased proteasomal protein degradation , as observed by accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins ( 64 ) , progresses with decreased muscle size and func - tion in prediabetic and overtly diabetic mice . Western blotting of whole muscle homogenate with an anti - k48 - polyubiquitin speciﬁc antibody revealed a clear increase in the quantity of polyubiquitin - conjugated proteins over the observed range of 25 – 250 kDa in db / db muscle . Accumulation of polyubiquiti - nated proteins was already signiﬁcantly increased in fast , slow , and cardiac muscles from prediabetic db / db mice ( gastrocne - Table 1 .

Decreased Insulin - Dependent FOXO1 Activation and Increased Expression of MuRF - 1 , Atrogin - 1 in db / db Muscle MuRF - 1 and atrogin - 1 are well - studied E3 ubiquitin ligases that catalyze a rate - limiting step of protein ubiquitination that labels the substrate protein for subsequent proteasomal protein degradation . Of the large family of E3 ligases , MuRF - 1 and atrogin - 1 are notable for their role in being associated with and partially necessary for many types of muscle atrophy ( 6 ) . Western blotting showed a statistically insigniﬁcant trend to - ward increased levels of E3 ubiquitin ligases Murf - 1 and atrogin - 1 in fast ( tibialis anterior ) and slow / mixed ( soleus ) muscle from 12 - wk - old db / db mice compared with age - matched WT mice ( Fig . 5 F ) . FOXO Family Signaling Promotes Transcription of Atrogin - 1 and MuRF - 1 Insulin - dependent phosphorylation of FOXO1 is associated with deactivation of transcriptional activity by translocation of FOXO1 out of the nucleus . We found that insulin - dependent phosphorylation of FOXO1 was blunted in the tibialis anterior , diaphragm , and the cardiac muscles of 12 - wk - old db / db mice compared with WT controls ( Fig . 5 D ) . Increased Accumulation of Polyubiquitinated Proteins Is Not Found in Muscle from TallyHo and HFD Models of Insulin - Resistant Diabetes To test if the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins is a feature common to diabetes in general , or just speciﬁc to db / db mice , we tested two additional models of insulin - resistant diabetes ( Fig . 5 E ) .

These ﬁndings suggest that in - creased muscle accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins is not a common feature to all models of insulin resistance or diabetes mellitus . Increased Serum Corticosterone and Inﬂammatory Cytokines in db / db mice But Not TallyHo Mice Morning serum corticosterone levels were elevated in db / db mice compared with WT C57BLKS / j age - matched controls . Serum corticosterone was reduced in TallyHo mice compared with both WT controls and db / db mice ( Fig . 5 G ) .

We hypothesized that decreased muscle activity may be sufﬁcient to cause the observed reduction of muscle weight . To test if increased physical activity could reverse the muscle pheno - type , we used chronic exercise , which is a treatment commonly prescribed for individuals with reduced muscle size and type 2 diabetes ( 2 ) . Chronic forced treadmill training for 8 wk did not alter weight gain ( Fig . 6 C ) but improved glucose tolerance ( Fig . 6 D ) and increased maximum running speed ( Fig . 6 E ) and maximum cardiac capacity ( V˙ O 2max ) ( Fig . 6 F ) . The exercise treatment did not increase the apparent size of hindlimb mus - culature and did not cause an increase in centrally located nuclei ( Fig . 6 B ) . Chronic exercise slightly increased the weight of the gastrocnemius muscle compared with sedentary db / db mice but did not rescue the muscle weight to healthy WT levels . However , the weight of the tibialis anterior muscle was not signiﬁcantly increased by exercise ( Table 1 ) . Chronic Exercise Reduces Levels of Ubiquitinated Proteins and Increases Akt Phosphorylation On the biochemical level , chronic forced treadmill exercise for 8 wk was sufﬁcient to reduce accumulation of polyubiq - uitinated proteins in db / db diabetic mice to levels similar to those seen in WT sedentary controls ( Fig . 6 G ) . Exercise - induced rescue of ubiquitination was accompanied by a signif - icant reduction in atrogin - 1 and a trend toward reduced MuRF - 1 protein levels ( Fig . 6 H ) . Although total Akt protein levels are decreased in db / db mice , exercise did not rescue the Akt protein levels but did increase the level of Akt phosphor - ylation ( Fig . 6 I ) . DISCUSSION Early Onset of Reduced Muscle Size in db / db Mice A key ﬁnding in db / db mice was that reduced skeletal muscle size and decreased running ability is already present at 5 wk of age , before the onset of chronic hyperglycemia ( Fig . 1 ) . This indicates that overt diabetes , chronic hyperglycemia , and comorbidities that accompany chronic diabetes [ such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( 48 ) and diabetic nephropathy ( 10 ) ] are not necessary for decreased muscle weight and function in this model . If the db / db muscle phenotype is representative of human diabetic muscle loss , this early de - creased muscle size would suggest that insulin resistance may be sufﬁcient to cause muscle atrophy before the onset of overt T2DM . Limited studies in young men ( n (cid:5) 51 , ages 18 – 35 ) do indicate a positive correlation between insulin sensitivity and lean body mass study ( 61 ) . However , further work must be done to establish if early insulin resistance is sufﬁcient to cause muscle loss in prediabetic humans . Alternatively , early decreased muscle size and function in db / db mice may not represent diabetic muscle loss but instead a failure of normal physiological skeletal muscle growth . Indeed , the early onset of decreased muscle size in db / db mice suggests that dysfunctional metabolism ( e . g . , altered leptin signaling , insulin resistance , and hyperlipidemia ) during mus - cle development may create a growth - adverse environment in which normal muscle growth is stunted . In addition to glucose metabolism , insulin signaling interacts with critical growth - promoting and growth - permitting pathways [ e . g . , insulin - like growth factor - I ( 54 ) , leptin ( 45 ) , AMP - activated protein ki - nase , Akt , and mTOR ] to integrate metabolic control and growth control ( 57 ) . Indeed , conditional overexpression of constituitively active Akt1 has been shown to improve meta - bolic parameters in diet - induced insulin - resistant mice ( 21 ) and age - related insulin - resistant mice ( 1 ) . Therefore , it is reason - able that the juvenile onset of insulin resistance , absent leptin signaling , and altered metabolism could compromise early muscle growth in the db / db mouse . Additional evidence comes from the ob / ob mouse , which , like the db / db mouse , is leptin - signaling deﬁcient and insu - lin resistant . The ob / ob mouse has normal gastrocnemius weight up to 2 wk of age , after which ob / ob muscle growth is stunted , with ob / ob muscle growing much more slowly than the WT muscle ( 41 ) . Therefore , the reduced muscle mass seen in ob / ob and db / db mice is likely the result of a failure of physiological hypertrophy , rather than atrophy of a fully developed muscle . Although this diminished muscle growth could be because of the altered metabolic milieu caused by early insulin resistance [ db / db have increased serum insulin levels by (cid:2) 10 days of age ( 11 ) ] , it could also be caused by the combined effects of leptin ( 17 , 45 ) , lipotoxicity ( 59 , 60 ) , or deﬁcient growth hormone signaling on skeletal muscle growth and metabolism . From these data , it is reasonable to conclude that the juvenile onset of insulin resistance , decreased muscle size , and severe diabetes in the db / db mouse model may not accurately reﬂect the typical pattern of adult - onset diabetes and muscle atrophy of mature muscle seen in human patients with T2DM . These studies caution that future studies in leptin signaling - deﬁcient models should take into account the presence of poor predia - betic muscle growth and verify ﬁndings in additional models of T2DM . Muscle Growth and Function in Tallyho Mice Is Not Decreased To expand our ﬁndings to a leptin - intact adult - onset model of T2DM , we also studied the TallyHo mouse model . The TallyHo mouse is a polygenic mature - onset model of severely hyperglycemic type 2 diabetes with intact leptin signaling , insulin resistance , and deﬁcient muscle - speciﬁc glucose uptake ( 26 ) . We were surprised to ﬁnd no indication of muscle loss in the TallyHo mice ; muscle weight increased with age ( Table 1 ) , and exercise capacity was maintained ( Fig . 2 ) when comparing 2 - mo - old ( prediabetic ) and 6 - mo - old ( overtly diabetic ) mice ( 26 ) . However , we cannot exclude that muscle mass and function could be affected in older TallyHo mice . The lack of observed muscle loss in TallyHo mice within the ﬁrst 6 mo of life suggests that insulin resistance and chronic hyperglycemia alone are insufﬁcient to cause rapid muscle loss in mice . The heterogeneity of muscle phenotypes in models of T2DM is further shown in additional models of T2DM ; high - fat diet - fed mice have mild increases in muscle size and no signiﬁcant changes in skeletal muscle apoptosis , proteolysis , or autophagy compared with lean controls ( 60 ) . The relatively mild diabetic phenotype of diet - induced obesity mice com - pared with humans and other models of T2DM may account for the paucity of muscle pathology in HFD - fed mice ( 38 ) .

Thus , the observed differences between animal models of T2DM suggest that additional factors such as age of onset of diabetes , poor leptin signaling , degree of hyperinsulinemia , genetic strain , altered cytokine signaling , and differing diabetes - associated comorbidities may dictate the effects of diabetes on muscle growth and maintenance . These ﬁndings together with studies showing improved muscle phenotypes with treatment of dia - betes in db / db mice ( 62 ) and humans ( 14 , 36 , 37 ) suggest that T2DM acts to exacerbate muscle loss instigated by other factors ( e . g . , age , injury , disuse , and chronic disease ) . Increased Glucocorticoid and Inﬂammatory Signaling Correlates with Decreased Muscle Size and Function in Insulin - Resistant Mice Previous studies have shown that intact glucocorticoid sig - naling is necessary for the rapid muscle loss that occurs in streptozotocin - induced T1DM ( 19 ) . Our results suggest that glucocorticoid and inﬂammatory signaling are similarly impor - tant in muscle loss in T2DM . Indeed , in the T2DM mouse model with poor muscle size and function ( db / db ) , corticoste - rone and inﬂammatory cytokine signaling are increased ( Fig . 5 G and Table 2 ) . Conversely , in the T2DM mouse model with intact muscle growth and function ( TallyHo ) , serum cortico - sterone was actually lower than control mice . These ﬁndings suggest a positive correlation between increased glucocortico - id / inﬂammatory signaling and poor muscle growth / function in T2DM that could be targeted therapeutically . However , further work employing genetic and pharmacological approaches must be done to determine if increased glucocorticoid signaling is essential to muscle loss in individuals with T2DM . Insulin - Dependent Protein Synthesis Is Severely Blunted in db / db Mice To understand the basis for decreased muscle size in db / db mice , we studied biochemical markers of protein synthesis and the level of polyubiquitinated proteins destined for proteasomal degradation . Several human studies indicate that , in diabetes , whereas meal - induced protein synthesis is normal , protein degradation is increased and drives net protein loss , although the ﬁndings are inconsistent [ type 1 diabetes ( 12 , 35 , 40 , 51 ) and type 2 diabetes ( 5 , 62 ) ] . Our ﬁndings of blunted insulin - dependent phosphorylation of regulators of protein synthesis ( Akt , mTOR , p70S6K , S6 , and 4EBP - 1 ) in slow , mixed , fast , and cardiac muscle types of 12 - wk - old db / db mice suggest that insulin resistance may decrease insulin - dependent protein syn - thesis and contribute to decreased muscle size ( Fig . 4 ) . These ﬁndings may differ from human studies ( 30 ) measuring meal - induced protein synthesis because the use of carbohydrate or protein ingestion to induce protein synthesis allows for com - pensatory hyperinsulinemia , which may be sufﬁcient to nor - malize protein synthesis in insulin - resistant individuals . In contrast , the direct intraperitoneal administration of insulin studied here in db / db mice compares responses to equivalent increases in insulin . Markers of Protein Degradation in Insulin - Resistant Mice Previous studies in db / db mice showed that the rate of muscle protein degradation is increased , as measured by ex vivo tyrosine release ( 62 ) . This ﬁnding is further supported by our observations in db / db mice of decreased insulin - dependent FOXO1 phosphorylation , increased atrophy - associated E3 ubiq - uitin ligase expression ( i . e . , MuRF - 1 and atrogin - 1 ) , and increased accumulation of K48 - polyubiquitin - conjugated proteins ( Fig . 5 ) . Wang et al . ( 62 ) observed increased proteasomal chymotrypic - like peptidase function in muscle from 9 - wk - old db / db mice , suggesting that the increase we observed in ubiquitin - conju - gated protein is caused by an increased rate of ubiquitination , rather than by decreased proteasomal function . Moreover , accumulation of ubiquitin - conjugated proteins has been closely linked with increased muscle protein degradation rates during starvation and denervation muscle atrophy ( 64 ) . This increase of ubiquitinated proteins was already evident in slow , fast , and cardiac muscle from young prediabetic db / db mice and further increased in overtly diabetic db / db mice , suggesting that in - creased muscle protein degradation is a global db / db muscle phenomenon and contributes to the poor muscle growth present in skeletal muscle from db / db mice . On the other hand , accu - mulation of ubiquitinated proteins was not evident in gastroc - nemius muscle of HFD - fed mice or Tallyho mice , suggesting that factors other than insulin resistance and chronic hypergly - cemia may be responsible for increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins . Exercise Training of db / db Mice Improves Muscle Function and Glucose Tolerance When muscle loss in patients interferes with physical func - tion , chronic exercise is a treatment commonly prescribed to increase muscle function , muscle mass , and to improve glucose tolerance . Although chronic exercise of db / db mice improved glucose tolerance , cardiac capacity ( V˙ O 2max ) , and running speeds , only a mild increase in ﬁnal muscle weight was observed in exercised compared with nonexercised db / db mice , indicating that exercise is insufﬁcient to fully rescue muscle growth in the db / db mouse model . This suggests that decreased muscle use ( Fig . 6 A ) is not the basis for the reduced muscle size of db / db mice . Despite the inability to completely rescue muscle growth , exercise was sufﬁcient to increase basal Akt Ser 473 phosphorylation and reduce both MuRF - 1 expres - sion and accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins ( Fig . 6 , G – I ) . This suggests that decreased protein degradation and increased protein synthesis was responsible for the mild in - crease in muscle weight in the exercised db / db mice . More - over , these ﬁndings support the current clinical use of exercise to improve glucose tolerance , muscle function , and exercise capacity . In summary , our studies in the db / db and TallyHo mouse models suggest that the effects of type 2 diabetes on muscle mass and function are model - dependent and correlate with glucocorticoid and inﬂammatory signaling . The reduced mus - cle size in db / db mice before the onset of overt hyperglycemia and diabetes suggests that the db / db mouse model is an extreme model of diabetes in which the altered metabolic milieu caused by insulin resistance and defective leptin signal - ing may be toxic to early muscle growth .

It is likely that additional factors such as genetic background , hyperinsulinemia , lipotoxicity , leptin signaling , age of onset , and diabetic comorbidities inﬂuence whether the metabolic milieu is toxic to or supportive of growth and maintenance of skeletal muscle in T2DM .
