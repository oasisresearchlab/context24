What Determines Patent Value ? - Insights from the Semiconductor Industry Markus Reitzig * Institute for Innovation Research and Technology Management , University of Munich Abstract The paper contributes to an understanding which impact certain patent characteristics have on the value of patent rights . In an exploratory study , 127 individual patents from a semiconductor company were evaluated comprehensively by technical and marketing representatives . The analysis of these rare data shows that for patents used as ‘bargaining chips’ , novelty and inventive step are most important . The difficulty to invent around is of minor importance , so is disclosure . Due to a selection bias the influence of patent age on its value can hardly be determined . The results hint at a differentiated theoretical plausibility of value indicators .
