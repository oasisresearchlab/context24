Confocal xy sectioning microscopy analysis and 3D reconstruction of anti ‐ active α 5 integrin cell surface localization following 20 minutes of incubation with SNAKA51 mAb ( green ) and VC5 mAb ( red ) on living ECs . Side , top , and bottom views as well as quantitative analysis of apico ‐ basal mean fluorescence intensity ratio revealed that while SNAKA51 + active α 5 integrin localizes on the basolateral surface of ECs , VC5 + total α 5 integrin is randomly distributed all around the cell surface . Quantitative analysis of apico ‐ basal mean fluorescence intensity ratio of total α 5 β 1 integrin , as recognized by rabbit polyclonal Ab1928 antibody , was performed as further control of VC5 staining . * * * P < 0 . 001 , Student’s t ‐ test . 2 Supplementary Figure 2 . In ECs total / inactive , but not active α 5 β 1 integrin recycles mainly from early endosomal compartments . Time ‐ course analysis of the relative amounts of total / inactive ( a ) or active ( b ) α 5 β 1 integrins , as respectively recognized by VC5 and SNAKA51 mAbs , which recycle after being left to be endocytosed for different time points . Total / inactive ( a ) , but not active ( b ) α 5 β 1 integrins are only and rapidly recycled to the EC surface within 5 minutes after endocytosis . On the contrary , active ( b ) α 5 β 1 integrins are recycled to the cell surface also at later time points ( 10 and 15 min ) . Values are mean ± s . e . m . , n = 3 technical replicates . One out of three independent experiments is shown . 3 Supplementary Figure 3 . PPFIA1 drives basolateral localization of active α 5 β 1 integrin in sparse cells . ( a ) Confocal xy and xz sectioning microscopy analysis of anti ‐ active α 5 β 1 integrin cell surface localization ( red ) following 20 minutes of incubation with SNAKA51 mAb on living sparse ECs . ( b ) Quantitative analysis of apico ‐ basal mean intensity ratio of SNAKA51 + active α 5 β 1 integrin . SNAKA51 + active α 5 β 1 integrin localizes on the basolateral surface of sparse siCTL , but not siPPFIA1 ECs , in which it randomly redistributes all around the cell surface . Data are mean ± s . e . m . , n = 20 cells per condition pooled from 2 independent experiments . Scale bar , 20 µm ( a ) * * * P < 0 . 001 , Student’s t ‐ test . 4 Supplementary Figure 4 . PPFIA1 localizes on the basolateral surface of ECs . Confocal xz sectioning microscopy analysis of PPFIA1 ‐ GFP localization ( green ) in confluent ECs that were co ‐ stained with the nuclear marker TO ‐ PRO ‐ 3 . Scale bar , 5 μ m 5 Supplementary Figure 5 . Exogenous ED ‐ A FN doesn’t rescue basolateral fibrillar FN network in siPPFIA1 ECs . Confocal microscopy analysis of IST ‐ 9 mAb ‐ labeled ED ‐ A FN ( green ) in confluent ECs . ED ‐ A FN polymerizes into a fibrillar network in siCTL , but not in siPPFIA1 ECs in which it accumulates in the TGN46 + ( red ) TGN cisternae . Exogenously added ED ‐ A FN ( 5 μ g / ml or 10 μ g / ml ) does not restore basolateral ED ‐ A FN polymerization in siPPFIA1 ECs . The relative amount of fibrillar ED ‐ A FN area was calculated in siCTL , siPPFIA1 and siPPFIA1 + 5 or 10 μ g / ml exogenous ED ‐ A FN ECs . Data are mean ± s . e . m . , n = 20 cells per condition pooled from 2 independent experiments . Scale bar , 50 µm . * * * P < 0 . 001 , Student’s t ‐ test . 6 Supplementary Figure 6 .

Effective siRNA ‐ mediated gene silencing of PPFIBP1 , PTPRF , AP1M , PI4KB , RAB11A , and RAB11B proteins in ECs . Western blot analysis of lysates of ECs , control ( siCTL ) , or PPFIBP1 ( siPPFIBP1 ) , or PTPRF ( siPTPRF ) , or AP1M1 ( siAP1M1 ) , or PI4KB ( siPI4KB ) , or RAB11A ( siRAb11A ) , or RAB11B ( siRAB11B ) silenced . ECs were lysed 24 , 48 , 72 and 96 hours after the second siRNA oligofection and proteins were separated by SDS ‐ PAGE and probed for the corresponding Abs . Where more bands are present in Western Blots the arrowhead indicates the one corresponding to the specific protein . 8 Supplementary Figure 8 . PPFIA1 silencing affects vascular morphogenesis in cultured ECs . Representative pictures of vascular networks formed by pLVX siCTL , pLVX siPPFIA1 , and pLVX ‐ PPFIA1r + siPPFIA1 ECs plated on growth factor ‐ reduced Matrigel matrix . PLVX siCTL but not pLVX siPPFIA1 ECs form capillary networks that are covered by a dense meshwork of polymerized cellular ED ‐ A fibronectin . PLVX ‐ mediated PPFIA1r overexpression restores capillary network formation and ED ‐ A FN polymerization by siPPFIA1 ECs . Scale bar , 100 µm . 9 Supplementary Figure 9 . A TGN ‐ hinged signaling pathway couples active α 5 β 1 integrin traffic and fibronectin fibril turnover . In ECs , upon MT1 ‐ MMP ‐ dependent cleavage of FN fibrils , FN fragment ‐ bound active α 5 β 1 integrins undergo Rab21 GTPase ‐ driven internalization within early endosomes . From this subcellular location , FN fragment ‐ bound active α 5 β 1 integrins traffic to post ‐ Golgi vesicles ( PGCs ) that bud , in a PI4KB and AP ‐ 1A ‐ dependent manner , from the Trans ‐ Golgi network ( TGN ) cisternae and contain freshly synthesized FN . Within PGCs , active α 5 β 1 integrins may swap old FN fragments for new FN dimers and the former are likely directed towards the late endosomal / lysosomal compartments for degradation . PGCs containing fresh FN ‐ bound active α 5 β 1 integrins are then directed , on a RAB11B ‐ dependent pathway , towards the basolateral side of ECs . Here , the PTPRF / PPFIA1 complex localizes in close proximity of fibrillar adhesions . Similarly to the function that it plays in neuron presynaptic sites and thanks to its ability to bind the β 1 cytotail of active α 5 β 1 integrin , PPFIA1 may favor the docking of PGCs containing fresh FN ‐ bound active α 5 β 1 integrins . The ensuing fusion of PGCs with the plasma membrane may favor the targeted local appearance of fresh FN ‐ bound active α 5 β 1 integrins , thus allowing the replacement of old for new FN within fibrils . Finally , a corollary hypothesis may be that , upon endocytosis , active α 5 β 1 integrin ‐ bound non ‐ polymerized FN dimers recycle back to the basolateral EC surface and that this endo ‐ exocytic cycle continues until FN dimers incorporate into fibrils due to polymerization ( not depicted ) . 10 Supplementary Figure 10 .
