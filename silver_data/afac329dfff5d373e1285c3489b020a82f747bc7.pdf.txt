In the summer of 2021 , environmental parameters were monitored , and 14 students in a university library in Guangzhou , China , were surveyed to analyze the possible symptoms 15 of wearing masks for a long time , and to assess the sensitivity of various body parts to the 16 environmental parameters . Concurrently , the preference of subjects wearing masks for various 17 environmental parameters was also analyzed . Additionally , the relationship between thermal 18 Abbreviations : T a : Air temperature , V a : Air velocity , T op : Operation temperature ; PMV : Predicted Mean Vote , TSV : Thermal sensation vote , ASV : Air movement sensation vote , PD : Unacceptable percentage , RH : Relative humidity , T mrt : Mean radiant temperature , SET * : Standard Effective Temperature , PPD : Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied , MTSV : Mean thermal sensation vote , MASV : Mean air movement sensation vote J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2 sensation and thermal index was analyzed to identify acceptable and comfortable temperature ranges . 19 The expected duration of wearing masks was counted . Subjects wearing masks had greater 20 requirements for environmental comfort , and reported increased thermal discomfort of the face and 21 head , compared to those without masks . More than 70 % of the subjects wearing masks reported that 22 they experienced discomfort on their faces . Among the subjects who experienced discomfort , 62 . 7 % 23 reported that facial fever was the main symptom ; while some reported symptoms of dyspnea ( 25 . 4 % ) 24 and rapid heartbeat ( 9 . 1 % ) . More than 75 % of the subjects were expected to wear masks for 2 . 0 hours 25 or less . Evaluation of environmental thermal sensation , including overall , facial , and head thermal 26 sensation , differed among subjects who wore and did not wear masks . The indexes of neutral 27 Operative temperature / Standard Effective Temperature ( T op / SET * ) and preferred T op / SET * were 28 lower among subjects with masks than among those without masks . The neutral T op / SET * deviation 29 was 0 . 3 °C , and the preferred T op / SET * deviation was 0 . 5 °C . Additionally , the acceptable and 30 comfortable temperature zones differed between the two cases . The subjects who wore masks 31 preferred colder temperatures . These findings indicated that the environmental parameters should be 32 adjusted to improve the thermal comfort of the human body while wearing masks in work or study 33 places . 34 Keywords : University library ; Masks ; Human body ; Thermal sensation ; Operative temperature 35 36 1 . Introduction 37 On March 11 , 2020 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared the COVID - 19 outbreak 38 as a pandemic [ 1 ] . The emergence and rapid spread of COVID - 19 , caused by SARS - CoV - 2 , has led 39 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 to approximately 180 million confirmed cases and nearly 4 million deaths worldwide as of June 19 , 40 2021 [ 2 ] . It had an unprecedented impact globally , leading to a 2 % – 3 % increase in the global 41 mortality rate [ 3 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 spreads through direct contact when a symptomatic person coughs , 42 sneezes , speaks , or exhales [ 4 - 6 ] . The main symptoms of COVID - 19 are fever , fatigue , and dry cough , 43 accompanied by nasal congestion , runny nose , and diarrhea in some patients [ 7 ] . The main measures 44 for preventing infection are sanitization , vaccination , and wearing masks [ 8 - 10 ] . Masks have become 45 essential commodities in the daily lives of people during traveling , working , and studying . Wearing 46 masks in public places is the most effective and economical method to prevent human - to - human 47 transmission of the virus and regulate the COVID - 19 outbreak [ 11 ] . Such a widespread use of masks , 48 thus , necessitates the need to comprehensively investigate the impact of masks on human thermal 49 comfort . 50 1 . 1 Literature review 51 Personal medical masks typically consist of three layers with a melt - blown microfiber filter 52 between two layers of spunbond fabric . The melt - blown layer acts as the main filter , preventing 53 microorganisms from entering or leaving the mask . The outer non - woven fabric has the properties of 54 liquid resistance and rejection of external droplets , and the inner non - woven fabric has the properties 55 of skin affinity and moisture absorption [ 12 , 13 ] . In manikin studies , medical masks were highly 56 effective for both source control and primary prevention under tidal breathing and coughing 57 conditions [ 14 , 15 ] . Despite their acknowledged benefits for protection and insulation against toxins 58 and viruses , using masks causes side effects as they induce a microclimate of high temperatures and 59 thick humid air ; additionally , wearing masks can lead to significant discomfort and breathing 60 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 difficulties for most people [ 114 ] . Further , the air temperature in the mask has a significant impact 61 on human thermal sensation [ 16 ] . 62 Previous studies on indoor thermal comfort [ 17 - 27 ] without masks have been conducted . Gabriel 63 et al . [ 22 ] found that the neutral temperatures from TSV in Quito , Guayaquil , and Tena in Ecuador 64 were 21 . 8 °C , 26 . 3 °C , and 26 . 9 °C respectively . Wang et al . [ 23 ] found that at different temperatures 65 students’ performance could be affected , depending on the task being performed . Fang et al . ( 2018 ) 66 reported an 80 % comfortable temperature range of 21 . 6 – 26 . 8 °C with a mean insulation value of 0 . 42 67 clo in Hong Kong [ 24 ] , and Dhaka et al . ( 2017 ) reported an 80 % acceptable SET * range of 23 . 4 – 68 26 . 6 °C with a mean insulation value of 0 . 55 clo in India [ 25 ] . These studies were conducted prior to 69 the pandemic and hence , did not factor the effect of masks ; however , since the pandemic was declared , 70 wearing masks in public places has become mandatory to wear masks to prevent the COVID - 19 71 infection [ 28 - 32 ] . Therefore , further research is needed on human thermal comfort in public places 72 where wearing masks is an essential requirement . 73 1 . 2 Research objective 74 In this investigation , the subjects were the students in Guangzhou University library , which is a 75 public place with a high population density . The impact of students wearing masks on thermal 76 comfort was significant , which would affect their learning efficiency . Considering the effects of 77 wearing a mask , thermal comfort can be improved by improving the indoor thermal environment . 78 Thus , the objectives of this study was pointed out , as follows . 79 ( 1 ) Determine the impact of wearing masks on the personal comfort of students in Guangzhou 80 University Library . 81 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 ( 2 ) Analyze the physical discomfort caused by wearing masks . 82 ( 3 ) Establish different thermal comfort models under the conditions of wearing masks and not 83 wearing masks . 84 85 2 . Methods 86 The methods of this study are as follows . First , data on the subjects ' overall and local ( face , head , 87 back , chest , and limbs ) perceptions ( “votes” ) of environmental parameters were collected , collated , 88 and analyzed . Second , the indoor thermal comfort index was calculated , neutral temperature was 89 determined using linear regression , while preferred temperature was determined using probit 90 regression . Finally , the acceptable and comfort temperatures were determined by analyzing the 91 perception data and the thermal comfort results . The results of this study can assist in improving the 92 comfort levels of students by adjusting the T op and can subsequently be used on a large - scale in other 93 public places . 94 95 2 . 1 Research environment 96 The study was conducted in the Guangzhou University library ( Fig . 1 ) . Guangzhou is located in 97 the Pearl River Delta in South China ( 112° – 114 . 2° E and 22 . 3° – 24 . 1° N ) . The library has five floors , 98 among which the first floor was the archival room . Students primarily use the third and fourth floors 99 for self - study . The fifth floor is also used by few students , but because of the transparent roof , the 100 ambient temperature of this floor is generally higher than that of the lower floors . To expand the 101 temperature range observed in the study , third , fourth , and fifth floors were selected for further 102 investigation . The study period was June 2021 . As shown in Fig . 2 , based on the data from the 103 Guangzhou Meteorological Station , the average temperature reached 30 °C in Guangzhou in June ; 104 the maximum outdoor temperature reached 37 °C , and average relative humidity ( RH ) ranged 105 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 between 70 % and 95 % . Therefore , most people feel uncomfortable in outdoor environments during 106 this month . 107 108 Fig . 1 . Testing site . 109 110 Fig . 2 . Outdoor daily air temperature variation range and daily average relative humidity in 111 Guangzhou in June 2021 112 113 2 . 2 Subjective survey and measurements 114 A total of 1602 healthy college students ( 550 males and 1052 females ; detailed information is 115 provided in Table 1 ) were randomly invited to participate in the survey . The field survey were 116 conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki , and informed 117 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 consents were obtained from all participants . When they agreed , their health status needs to been 118 record , including having a fever , cough , sore throat , or chronic disease et al . And then , the participants 119 start to answer the questionnaires . In this investigation , the subjects were all of health students . Before 120 they answered the questionnaire , they need to indicate their heath condition , except any discomfort 121 for masks . Meanwhile we suggest that when filling in the questionnaire , the subjects only consider 122 that the factor causing their discomfort is wearing masks . In addition , all of the subjects were request 123 to keep to seat in library exceeding half hour . Liu et al [ 33 ] found that when people enter a cold or 124 hotter environment , the skin temperature was stable after 10 - 20 minutes . Huizenga et al . [ 34 ] found 125 that the human core temperature and head temperature were balanced within 30 minutes . In other 126 previous studies [ 35 - 37 ] , 20 - 30 minutes of experimental preparation time was also adopted . Therefore , 127 this study was conducted on these basis to ensure that the subjects were in thermal equilibrium and 128 had not just entered the library . The filling time of each questionnaire last 3 - 4 minutes . The fluctuation 129 range of temperature and humidity in the library were small . Thus , the measurement and field survey 130 were reasonable . The testing subjects were presented in Fig . 3 . The average age of the subjects was 131 20 . 7 years . The clothing insulation values were estimated based on ASHRAE standard 55 [ 38 ] . They 132 were wearing short sleeved T - shirts ( 0 . 08 clo ) , thin trousers ( 0 . 15 clo ) , skirt ( 0 . 14 / 0 . 23 clo ) , bra ( 0 . 01 133 clo ) , panties ( 0 . 03 clo ) , men’s briefs ( 0 . 04 clo ) , socks ( 0 . 02 clo ) , and shoes ( 0 . 02 clo ) et al . The 134 average total clothing insulation ( Icl ) was 0 . 39 clo during the test . 135 Table 1 .

Testing subjects . 141 142 A written , self - completed questionnaire , consisting of two parts , was used to survey the 143 participants . The first part investigated subjective votes on the thermal sensation ( TSV ) , air movement 144 sensation ( ASV ) , and humidity sensation ( HSV ) using the scales shown in Table 2 . The second part 145 investigated whether students wore masks , whether they experienced any symptoms of discomfort , 146 and assessed the duration of wearing masks . The scales of the subjective vote were in accordance 147 with the thermal environment comfort levels described in the ASHRAE Standard 55 [ 40 ] and ISO 148 7726 [ 41 ] . 149 Table 2 .

According to the ISO 7726 guidelines [ 41 ] , test 154 instruments ( described in Section 2 . 3 ) were placed near the seats ( to increase the accuracy of 155 measurement ) at a height of 1 . 1 m near the head or face of the subjects in a sitting position . In many 156 indoor thermal comfort studies [ 42 - 46 ] , the height of the instrument were chose at the level of 1 . 1m . 157 When the human body is sitting still , the height of the head or face is about 1 . 1m . These parts can be 158 in direct contact with the environment for heat exchange . The sensitivity of the head and face is 159 relatively strong [ 47 - 52 ] . Thus , in this field survey , the height of the instrument was set at level of 160 1 . 1 m . A standard globe thermometer with a diameter ( D ) of 0 . 15 m that was painted matt black 161 ( globe emissivity , ε g = 0 . 95 ) was used to measure the globe bulb temperature . The mean radiant 162 temperature ( T mrt ) was calculated using Eq . ( 1 ) [ 22 ] : 163 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 273 10 1 1 273 4 1 4 0 6 0 8 4 −     −       + + = / a g . g . a g mrt ) T T ( ) D ε ( ) V .

PMV and SET * were calculated using the CBE Thermal Comfort Tool 171 ( http : / / comfort . cbe . berkeley . edu / ) . SET * can be adjusted according to differences in clothing and can 172 unify the data of different experimental conditions into the same dimension for comparative analysis . 173 Selecting SET * as the thermal environment index could minimize the impact of the inability to control 174 clothing in this study [ 52 , 53 ] . The T op was calculated according to the conditions presented in the 175 ASHRAE Standard 55 normative [ 38 ] . Linear regression and logistic regression were used to analyze 176 the relationship between the environmental parameters and the responses to the subjective 177 questionnaire .

Results 182 3 . 1 Thermal parameters 183 The observations of the measured indoor thermal parameters ( T a , RH , V a , and T mrt ) measured are 184 summarized in Table 4 . The mean T a , RH , and V a were 27 . 7 °C , 79 . 2 % , and 0 . 17 m / s respectively . 185 The minimum RH of the air in the library reached 74 . 1 % , indicating that the overall humidity in the 186 library was relatively high , which is related to the climate of Guangzhou [ 39 ] . Based on our 187 calculations , the minimum ( maximum ) values of PMV and T op were - 1 . 28 ( 2 . 19 ) , and 25 . 9 °C 188 ( 31 . 2 °C ) , respectively . 189 Table 4 .

T op in the library 192 was mostly ( 81 . 2 % ) between 26 °C and 29 °C . Owing to the influence of solar radiation , the fifth 193 floor of the library showed the highest temperature . The RH ranged mostly between 76 % and 82 % , 194 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 which is consistent with the outdoor relative humidity . The proportion of indoor V a less than 0 . 4 m / s 195 was high ( 92 . 9 % ) , and the perception of air blowing was not strong . 196 197 198 Fig . 4 .

Among them , 822 ( 73 . 9 % ) subjects indicated that wearing masks made them uncomfortable . 203 The voting distribution for discomfort regarding each body part is shown in Fig . 5 . The proportion of 204 facial discomfort was the largest ( 71 . 0 % ) , and was related to direct contact between the human body 205 and the mask .

As shown in Fig . 6 , 208 the symptoms most frequently voted by the subjects were facial heat ( 62 . 7 % ) , followed by dyspnea 209 ( 25 . 4 % ) . Some subjects who wore masks for a long time experienced rapid heartbeat ( 9 . 1 % ) and 210 nausea ( 4 . 1 % ) , and a small number felt dizzy and weak ( 7 . 9 % ) , or reported blurry vision ( 1 . 3 % ) . 211 212 Fig . 5 .

A greater proportion of subjects with masks preferred a higher air velocity than that of subjects 221 without wearing masks . Additionally , the more than half subjects preferred reduced the operative 222 temperature to improve thermal comfort , specially the subjects with masks . Thus , effects of masks 223 on thermal comfort are significant . The demands of air velocity and operative temperature was 224 different between wearing masks and without wearing masks . In addition , most subjects opined that 225 the humidity level was acceptable . The primary reason is that the subjects has strong adaptive ability 226 in high relative humidity in South China [ 54 - 56 ] . Therefore , in order to improve the thermal comfort 227 in an air - conditioned room , the operative temperature needs to be lower with higher air velocity . 228 229 Fig . 7 .

The proportion of subjects wearing masks who reported TSV greater 235 than zero was approximately 6 . 7 % greater than among those not wearing masks . Considering 236 individual parts of the body , the most obvious change in the TSV was in the face , where the 237 percentage of subjects wearing masks and reporting a TSV greater than zero increased by 238 approximately 11 . 4 % . The proportion of subjects who wore masks and reported a TSV greater than 239 zero for the head and chest were 6 . 5 % and 5 . 8 % , respectively . Further , the proportion of subjects who 240 wore masks and reported a TSV greater than zero for the back and limbs was small . Wearing masks 241 can affect the breathing frequency and inspiratory capacity , thereby resulting in heat accumulation on 242 the face , and an overall feeling of excessive heat . 243 244 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 16 245 246 Fig . 8 .

No difference was observed between those with and without masks in their 252 voting on the feeling of heat and wind on the back , chest , and limbs . The most obvious differences 253 between the subjects who wore and did not wear masks were in their reporting about the face and 254 head . In the subjects who wore masks , the mean TSV ( MTSV ) of the face and head was greater than 255 those who did not wear masks , and the mean ASV ( MASV ) decreased . For the whole body MTSV , 256 similar differences were observed between the subjects who wore and did not wear masks . 257 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 17 These correlations were calculated based on thermal sensation voting . Fig . 9 shows that the 258 correlation coefficient between wearing masks and not wearing masks is low , which indicates that 259 they have no correlation . The results were reasonable . The small p - value indicates that there is a 260 significant difference between them , which indicates that there is a significant difference between 261 wearing masks and not wearing masks in the whole thermal sensation and some local thermal 262 sensation . 263 In this investigation , due to the air condition , the indoor air temperature ranged from 26 °C to 264 29 °C . Most subjects always feel acceptable in whole body thermal sensation . In addition , the comfort 265 temperature was determined by the whole body thermal sensation . Thus , the difference of comfort 266 temperature between masks and no masks were not significant . However , from Fig . 8 and Fig . 9 , 267 mask mainly affects the face and head of the human body , resulting in higher requirements for the 268 comfort of the environment as a whole . , especially wearing the mask for a long time . Therefore , it is 269 very necessary to control environmental parameters for human local thermal sensation and whole 270 body thermal sensation . 271 272 Fig . 9 . Box plot for ( a ) thermal sensation vote and ( b ) air movement sensation vote 273 274 3 . 5 Correlation analysis of MTSV and T op / SET 275 The average TSV was calculated within 1 °C intervals of T op / SET * . Regression equation was 276 used to calculate neutral T op / SET * . As shown in Fig . 10 , for subjects without masks , when MTSV 277 was 0 °C , T op was 26 . 5 °C and SET * was 25 . 3 °C ; moreover , for subjects wearing masks , when MTSV 278 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 18 was 0 , T op was 26 . 2 °C and SET * was 25 . 0 °C . The neutral T op / SET * of the environment was 0 . 3 °C 279 lower for subjects wearing masks than for subjects without masks . 280 281 282 Fig . 10 . Relationship between T op / SET * and MTSV : ( a ) T op ; and ( b ) SET * 283 3 . 6 Preferred temperature 284 The subject’s actual thermal preference vote in the subjective questionnaire and the 285 corresponding T op / SET * were subjected to probit regression analysis , and the curves of the subject’s 286 preferred temperature increase and decrease , and the T op / SET * were obtained . The T op / SET * 287 corresponding to the intersection of the two curves represented the subject’s preferred T op / SET * . The 288 probability curves are shown in Fig . 11 ( a – d ) . The preferred T op of the subjects without masks was 289 27 . 0 °C , and that of subjects with masks was 0 . 5 °C lower at 26 . 5 °C . The preferred SET * of the 290 subjects without masks ( with masks ) was 25 . 5 °C ( 25 . 0 °C ) . 291 Many previous investigations also found that the neutral temperature was higher than the 292 preferred temperature [ 25 , 55 - 59 ] . However , in some previous investigations , the preferred 293 temperature is equal to or higher than the neutral temperature [ 60 , 61 ] . For example , Tewari et al . [ 60 ] 294 found that in Indian office buildings , the comfortable temperature was 28 . 8 °C higher by 0 . 7 °C than 295 the neutral temperature 28 . 1 °C . Zheng et al . [ 61 ] found that the values of neutral SET * and preferred 296 SET * were 25 . 6 °C in prefab construction site offices . In addition , some previous investigations show 297 that the regression method were used to analyze the subjects ' behavioral adaptation [ 62 - 64 ] . In hot 298 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 19 summer and warm zoom , human have strong adaptability of hot thermal environment . In air - 299 conditioned indoor thermal environment , the set temperature always lower than nature ventilation 300 condition . The subjects were trained in cooler indoor thermal environment . Thus , the neutral comfort 301 temperature was lower than preferred temperature . 302 303 304 Fig . 11 . Probit analysis of preferred T op / preferred SET * : ( a ) Without masks , ( b ) With masks 305 3 . 7 Acceptable temperature zone and comfort temperature zone 306 The percentage ( PD ) of items on the questionnaire voted as unacceptable per person was 307 regressed with the T op and SET * of the corresponding time point and the results are shown in Table 5 308 and Fig . 12 ( a – b ) . When PD was 20 % , an acceptable temperature zone was obtained , and when PD 309 was 10 % , a comfort temperature zone was obtained . As shown in Table 5 , the zone of acceptable T op 310 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 20 according to PD was 23 . 7 – 28 . 9 °C , and the comfort zone was 24 . 8 °C to 27 . 7 °C without masks . The 311 acceptable temperature zone obtained from SET * was 22 . 8 – 29 . 0 °C , and the comfort zone was 24 . 4 – 312 27 . 6 °C . Contrastingly , the acceptable temperature zone obtained by PD was 22 . 3 – 27 . 6 °C and the 313 comfort zone was 24 . 0 – 27 . 2 °C without masks . The temperature range calculated by T op was narrower 314 than that of SET * , and the actual acceptable temperature zone and comfort temperature zones were 315 wider . In addition , wearing a mask shifted the acceptable temperature and comfort temperature zones 316 to a lower temperature . 317 Table 5 .

The longer the duration for wearing masks , the wetter 329 the face will be , thereby reducing the comfort of the human body . Most people experienced increased 330 physical discomfort after exceeding their “acceptable duration , ” which affected their work and 331 learning efficiency . 332 . 333 Fig . 13 . Distribution of percent “acceptable duration” for wearing masks . 334 4 . Discussion 335 4 . 1 Effect of wearing face masks on human thermal comfort 336 Wearing masks while traveling , and in work and study places has become a daily part of people’s 337 lives [ 65 ] . The discomfort accompanied by wearing masks has also attracted attention [ 66 - 68 ] . In the 338 study or work place , wearing a mask for a long time may lead to a certain degree of physical 339 symptoms . While wearing masks , people need a more comfortable environment to reduce the thermal 340 discomfort caused by masks . Subsequently , people often remove their masks to alleviate their 341 11 . 78 23 . 20 21 . 67 19 . 33 4 . 50 7 . 28 3 . 69 2 . 97 2 . 79 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 3 . 5 4 . 0 4 . 5 P e r ce n t a g e ( % ) Time ( h ) J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 22 discomfort , which reduces work efficiency [ 68 , 69 ] . The inner layer of a mask that has been worn for 342 a long time gets wet because of condensation of the water vapor generated by breathing and sweat 343 evaporation [ 16 , 68 ] . People usually do not change masks regularly , and continue wearing the same 344 mask for a long time , which affects both hygiene and comfort . This study found that people who wore 345 masks preferred increased air velocity , especially to alleviate the discomfort on the head and face . As 346 shown in Fig . 8b , the MASV for the face and head of subjects who did not wear masks was close to 347 0 , while that of people who wore masks was one degree lower . The mask , which is in direct contact 348 with the head and face , not only hinders the evaporation and heat dissipation from the head and face 349 but also breathing , which explains the large proportion of chest discomfort . Therefore , fever and 350 redness on the face and dyspnea were the most prevalent symptoms that were reported after wearing 351 a mask for a long time . According to Fig . 12 , we recommend wearing a disposable face mask for no 352 more than 2 h to minimize discomfort . 353 4 . 2 Adaptive analysis of the Operative temperature 354 To analyze whether the regression equations of MTSV and T op obtained in this study were 355 adaptive , we compared the results of this study with those of previous studies . Table 6 summarizes 356 the relationship between the MTSV and the thermal indices in summer . Different regression equations 357 were obtained in different places , and the calculated neutral temperatures were also different . In 358 summer , for Guangdong , the neutral temperature of Guangzhou [ 56 , 70 ] differed from that of 359 Shenzhen [ 55 ] . The neutral temperature in Shenzhen was 25 . 0 °C , while that reported for Guangzhou 360 were 26 . 2 °C , 26 . 8 °C , and 26 . 5 °C ( 26 . 2 °C ) . The acceptable temperature range was 22 . 9 – 29 . 6 °C in 361 a prefabricated site office in Guangzhou and 20 . 2 – 29 . 4 °C for office staff in Shenzhen . In this study , 362 the acceptable temperature range was 23 . 7 – 28 . 9 °C ( 23 . 3 – 28 . 4 °C ) . This difference could be possibly 363 because prefabricated site offices are mainly used for construction workers , and their heat resistance 364 is greater than that of people working in regular offices [ 44 , 54 , 55 , 72 - 74 ] . A study in Shenzhen 365 reported that as people wear more layers of clothes when the ambient temperature is low , which 366 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 23 increases their thermal resistance , they adapt to a large temperature range [ 55 ] . The neutral SET * 367 values in two previous Guangzhou studies were 25 . 6 °C [ 70 ] and 26 . 18 °C [ 68 ] , respectively , while 368 the neutral SET * value obtained in this study was 25 . 3 °C ( 25 . 0 °C ) , which was associated with the 369 clothing habits of the subjects . Further , wearing masks lowered the neutral temperature value , and 370 the acceptable and comfort temperature ranges shifted to the left . 371 Table 6 .

Therefore , the influence of humidity on 376 thermal sensation was not analyzed in this study . In addition , the instrument for measuring 377 environmental parameters was placed at a height 1 . 1 m above the floor , which is close to the 378 horizontal position of the head when the human body is sitting ; hence , it was impossible to 379 specifically analyze the impact of various other environmental parameters on different parts of the 380 body . 381 We suggest that when filling in the questionnaire , the subjects only consider that the factor 382 causing their discomfort is wearing masks . Of course , the causes of discomfort also include air quality 383 and environmental parameters , which need to be considered in big data research and need to be paid 384 attention to in future research . Therefore , we could only make a general comparison based on the 385 existing voting data to analyze the sensitivity of each body part to the thermal environment in the 386 study area . Additionally , we only analyzed the comfort of the Operative temperature as a whole 387 without masks and with masks . In addition , subjects of different genders also have an impact on the 388 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 25 value of thermal indicators [ 75 ] . In this experiment , female subjects are about twice as much as male 389 subjects , so the neutral temperature and comfort temperature may be biased towards female needs . 390 391 5 . Conclusions 392 In the summer of 2021 , a field test and a questionnaire survey were conducted in a university 393 library in Guangzhou , China . By analyzing the perceived thermal sensations and the thermal index 394 of each parameter under the different environmental conditions for subjects with and without masks , 395 the following results were obtained : 396 ( 1 ) The subjects wearing masks had higher requirements for environmental comfort , and the thermal 397 discomfort in their face and head increased . More than 70 % of the subjects wearing masks 398 experienced discomfort on their faces . Among the subjects who felt uncomfortable , 62 . 7 % showed 399 facial fever as a main symptom , while others showed symptoms of dyspnea ( 25 . 4 % ) and rapid 400 heartbeat ( 9 . 1 % ) . 401 ( 2 ) For subjects without masks , the neutral T op was 26 . 5 °C and the preferred T op was 27 . 0 °C , while 402 the neutral SET * was 25 . 3 °C and the preferred SET * was 25 . 5 °C . For subjects with masks , the 403 neutral T op was 26 . 2 °C and the preferred T op was 26 . 5 °C , while the neutral SET * was 25 . 0 °C and 404 the preferred SET * was 25 . 0 °C . The neutral T op ( SET * ) difference was 0 . 3 °C and the preferred T op 405 ( SET * ) difference was 0 . 5 °C . 406 ( 3 ) For subjects without masks , the acceptable T op range was 23 . 7 °C to 28 . 9 °C , and the comfort T op 407 ranged from 24 . 8 °C to 27 . 7 °C , while the acceptable SET * zone ranged from 22 . 8 °C to 29 . 0 °C and 408 the comfort SET * zone range was 24 . 4 – 27 . 6 °C . For subjects wearing masks , the acceptable T op 409 ranged from 23 . 3 °C to 28 . 4 °C , and the comfort T op ranged from 24 . 6 to 27 . 1 °C , while the acceptable 410 SET * was 22 . 3 – 28 . 8 °C , and the comfort SET * ranged from 24 . 0 °C to 27 . 2 °C . In summary , the 411 subjects who wore masks preferred colder temperatures . 412 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 26 ( 4 ) The difference in thermal comfort between those wearing masks and those not wearing masks is 413 not very big . However , wearing mask for a long time may cause discomfort . Considering the thermal 414 comfort , it is recommended to wearing a mask for no more than 2 h . 415 416 Acknowledgements 417 This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( Project No . 418 51978180 ) , GuangDong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation ( 2021A1515011671 ) , and 419 the Key Medical Disciplines and Specialities Program of Guangzhou ( 2021 - 2023 ) .
