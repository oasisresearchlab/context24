Mudasir Ashraf Librarian , J & K Entrepreneurship Development Institute , Pampore , Jammu & Kashmir , India . E - mail : mudassir . ashraf2009 @ gmail . com Abstract A survey was conducted to explore the information seeking behaviour of physicians and surgeons of J & K working at primary , secondary and tertiary health care institutions by administrating a questionnaire and employing stratified random sampling . The findings reveal that the main reasons of professionals for seeking information are keeping up - to - date with current developments in the respective medical field and diagnosis / treatment recommendations . The results also depict that the professionals prefer textbooks the most followed by reference books and journals and make less use of online databases . Several factors influence the use of information sources by physicians and surgeons like availability , timeliness , ease of searching , currency , relevance etc . Survey results also highlights areas in which improvements are needed , such as availability of Internet facilities at work place , establishment of libraries in every medical institution , conduct of frequent seminars , conferences , user awareness programmes etc . This study may encourage and foster further research for effectiveness and better performance of medical libraries in the State .

INTRODUCTION The information universe is rapidly expanding in all disciplines of knowledge including medical sciences . The medical professionals cannot prescribe and practice high quality medicine without constantly updating their information which can help them in treating patients of specific and peculiar diseases . In the medical field , the enormous growth of information in all branches of the profession necessitated assessment of the users’ behaviour , their information seeking habits , their actual information needs and their interaction with information communication channels . For decades , the patrons have been studied by the librarians with care and attention to achieve maximum user satisfaction . According to Darling , Bishop and Colaianni ( 1983 ) , International Journal of Digital Library Services 20 | III JJJ OOO DDD LLL SSS VVVooolll . . . 222 , , , AAAppprrriiilll - - - JJJuuunnneee , , , 222000111222 , , , IIIssssssuuueee - - - 222 wwwwwwwww . . . iiijjjooodddlllsss . . . iiinnn ( ( ( IIISSSSSSNNN : : : 222222555000 - - - 111111444222 ) ) ) user studies were originally based on the premise that if general needs and preferences were identified , effective system could be designed to satisfy them . However , with changing times , these broad brush studies have given way in good measure to analysis of information gathering through specific channels . Over the past three decades , increasing attention has been paid to the information needs and information seeking behaviour of clinicians , by researchers in the computer sciences , information sciences , and medical informatics , with much of the work focused on the clinical use of ‘traditional’ text - based information resources such as journal articles , text - books , bibliographic databases and the paper - based medical record ( Woolf & Benson , 1989 ) , ( Smith , 1996 ) . However , no work is carried out in J & K which is geographically isolated for a long time but ICT revolution has made it a part of global community . In J & K State , medical practitioners like other parts of the world , spend nearly all their time in patient care , teaching , administration or research . Different professional activities give rise to various information needs . Their information needs vary with their work role in their specialized fields like medicine / surgery , nursing , pharmacy , clinical laboratory technology etc . To satisfy the different information needs , the professionals working in widely differing environments and engaged in a wide range of tasks , consult various information sources in different formats . Each specialized field has its own information seeking style , and the sources and types of literature sought are influenced by disciplinary culture . Further with the advent of the Internet and the rapid adaptation of Internet - accessible information resources , most notably the World Wide Web ( WWW ) , has radically changed the landscape for both information need and information seeking behaviour . The information seeking behaviour of these medical professionals need to be studied in detail and analyzed on the basis of relevant data . If , the lacunas in the present information services are identified and addressed , this helps in evolving a comprehensive , efficient and economical information services for the professionals in the field .

Weinberg , Ullian , Richards and Cooper ( 1981 ) report that colleague interaction occurs on a regular and frequent basis and is of considerable value to the physician seeking advice and information . Gruppen , Wolf , Van , Voorhees and Stross ( 1987 ) report that primary care internists have a greater preference for consulting the medical literature , while family physicians more often rely on colleagues and specialists as sources of information . Woolf and Benson ( 1989 ) conducted a survey at John Hopkins Hospital which reveals that the sources of reference information most commonly used by the faculty and house staff were textbooks and colleagues . However faculty reported greater use of MEDLINE . Gruppen ( 1990 ) carried a survey to identify the information seeking behaviour of physicians which reveals that physicians access Continuing Medical Education ( CME ) courses , mass media , patients , audiovisual programs , journals , textbooks , pharmaceutical representatives , colleagues , specialists and computerized databases , among others . Ely , Burch and Vinson ( 1992 ) report that colleagues and the Physician’s Desk Reference were the most often used resources of family physicians . Cheng and Lam ( 1996 ) made a survey in 35 hospitals in Hong Kong and confirm that medical staff was most satisfied with the library collections and services . Cullen ( 2002 ) made a survey among family practitioners in New Zealand which reveals that 48 . 6 % practitioners used the Internet to look for clinical information . MEDLINE was the most frequently accessed source . De Groote and Dorch ( 2003 ) made a survey at the Colleges of Medicine and Nursing at the Peoria Campus which reveals that a large percentage of faculty , residents and students prefer online resources to print . Convenience seems to play a major role in selecting resources , whether print or online . The study by Ocheibi and Buba ( 2003 ) reveals that the doctors in Maiduguri , Nigeria prefer the use of publishers catalogues as the most important source for new developments in their relevant fields . Many do not have access to local databases that are supposed to have remarkable impact on their information gathering behaviour . Owen and Fang ( 2003 ) made a survey at a health sciences campus in complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) which reveals that 82 % of faculty rate MEDLINE as a useful resource , 46 % personal contacts with colleagues , 46 % the Web , 40 % journals , and 20 % textbooks . Books and databases most frequently cited as useful had information about herbs .

Davies ( 2011 ) made a comparative study of information use of physicians of US , Canada and UK which reveals that US physicians used electronic resources for research more ( US 51 . 3 % all the time , Canada 47 . 5 % , and UK 26 . 3 % ) . Physicians utilized electronic resources for teaching in a similar pattern ( US 55 . 0 % all the time , Canada 32 . 5 % , and UK 22 . 5 % ) . Approximately 30 % of physicians in all the 3 countries used electronic resources ‘‘all the time , ’’ and more than 50 % ‘‘sometimes’’ used electronic resources to update their knowledge and / or skills . MEDLINE / PubMed was the most frequently used resource for all physicians . US and Canadian physicians ranked electronic full - text journals first , whilst the UK physicians ranked these third . UK physicians preferred using colleagues to assist in their clinical decision making ( which was ranked fourth by US and Canadian physicians ) . OBJECTIVES : The following objectives have been set forth : 1 . To know the purpose for which information is sought . 2 . To determine the types of resources physicians and surgeons use to find medical information and how they prefer to access this information . 3 . To identify the factors affecting the choice for consultation of information sources . 4 . To assess the impact of ICT on information seeking behaviour of physicians and surgeons . 5 . To gauge the awareness of users about the online medical databases / resources and to assess the extent of their utility . SCOPE : The study attempts to explore the information seeking behaviour of physicians and surgeons working in J & K at primary , secondary and tertiary health care institutions , which encompass 3567 medical colleges / associations / health institutions in public and 51 Registered Nursing Homes besides several solo practitioners in private sectors assembled under the following headings : International Journal of Digital Library Services 23 | III JJJ OOO DDD LLL SSS VVVooolll . . . 222 , , , AAAppprrriiilll - - - JJJuuunnneee , , , 222000111222 , , , IIIssssssuuueee - - - 222 wwwwwwwww . . . iiijjjooodddlllsss . . . iiinnn ( ( ( IIISSSSSSNNN : : : 222222555000 - - - 111111444222 ) ) ) 1 .

SKIMS & associated Medical College , and ASCOMS are tertiary health care institutions . GMCs / associated hospitals & GDCs are secondary health care institutions while District / Sub - district hospitals / dispensaries / health centres , Ayurvedic cum Unani hospitals / dispensaries and Private nursing homes are primary health care institutions . METHODOLOGY : A stratified random sample of 226 physicians and surgeons belonging to major medical fields and sub - fields was drawn by using the sample size determination formula . The professionals on the basis of their work roles were first divided into strata . The strata were selected from the seven main working environments as mentioned in the scope . Questionnaires were distributed and collected personally among professionals . The survey was previously piloted among several groups of physicians and surgeons . FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION : 1 . PURPOSE OF INFORMATION SEEKING Physicians and surgeons search for job specific information to keep themselves abreast with latest available information and developments in their respective fields . Majority of them 95 % search for information regarding diagnosis and treatment of specific diseases or disorders . Most of them 69 % seek information to prepare for debates , meetings , seminars , conferences etc . About 52 % of professionals acquire information regarding administrative issues such as procedures and protocols relevant and applicable in a particular health care organization or settings .

About 34 % of practitioners seek information to prepare for professional interviews while 33 % look for information for teaching purposes and performing lab / imaging investigations . ( Fig 1 ) 2 . RANKING OF INFORMATION SOURCES Medical professionals seek information from an endless number of sources . Knowledge of various information sources whether a colleague , an online database , or a book and the perceptions formed about the process or about the information retrieval plays a crucial role in the information - seeking process . The professional’s preferences for these sources and their access method can be conceptualized in terms of information seeking strategies , that they first access the most preferred source , followed by secondary sources when the problem remains unresolved . The preference given to various sources of information by physicians / surgeons while seeking information depicts that they prefer textbooks in the first place over other sources followed by Reference books and Journals at the 2 nd and 3 rd rank respectively . Physicians / surgeons place online databases ( e . g . , MEDLINE ) at 4th rank . Other preferences of sources of information are provided in the Table 1 . 0 . 0 % 20 . 0 % 40 . 0 % 60 . 0 % 80 . 0 % 100 . 0 % 94 . 7 % 32 . 7 % 36 . 3 % 46 . 9 % 32 . 7 % 68 . 6 % 51 . 3 % 33 . 6 % 100 . 0 % 0 . 0 % P e r c e n t a g e o f U s e r s Information sought for Fig . 1 : Purpose of Information Seeking by Physicians / surgeons International Journal of Digital Library Services 25 | III JJJ OOO DDD LLL SSS VVVooolll . . . 222 , , , AAAppprrriiilll - - - JJJuuunnneee , , , 222000111222 , , , IIIssssssuuueee - - - 222 wwwwwwwww . . . iiijjjooodddlllsss . . . iiinnn ( ( ( IIISSSSSSNNN : : : 222222555000 - - - 111111444222 ) ) ) Table 1 : Ranking of Sources of Information by Physicians / surgeons ( N = 226 ) Source of information Response ( N ) Preference of information source Av .

CHOICE OF SELECTION OF AN INFORMATION SOURCE Once an information need is identified , the medical professionals conduct the information search which depends on a number of factors . The professionals make a decision on whether to pursue an information query ; they reach a compromise between a number of conflicting factors including the need for the information and the associated costs of locating the information such as the time , effort , and financial costs involved in information seeking . The physicians / surgeons report availability , relevance , understandability and currency of information as very important factors affecting their choice for selection of an information source . Majority of them report comprehensiveness ( 81 % ) and reliability of information ( 75 % ) as major factors . The professionals state timeliness to search and extract the information ( 40 % ) , ease of searching ( 38 % ) and travelling time to reach the information source ( 38 % ) as somewhat significant factors . However , 15 % and 12 % of professionals does not take travelling time and ease of searching into consideration .

INFORMATION SOURCES : USE FOR GENERAL INFORMATION RETRIEVAL With expanding role of medical professionals , evaluation and retrieval of medical information has become essential requirement for the profession . Medical practitioners construct a search strategy using appropriate commands for the information access tool selected e . g . , Boolean operators , truncation , and proximity operators for databases / search engines ; internal organizers such as indexes for books . The Physicians / surgeons ( 54 % ) use the Primary Sources frequently ( a few times a week ) while as 26 . 5 % use sometimes ( once a week ) . The professionals especially involved in research , policy development , and other activities often require comprehensive retrieval , an exhaustive search of the literature , and in - depth sources of information requirement to devote more time to locate information . Professionals in clinical practice follow the ‘current’ approach i . e . they do not peruse everything that is written on a given topic , but gather information enough to answer a clinical problem . Colleagues , journals and reference books are the information resources that the professionals first turn to with an information query . Professional colleagues and librarians play a pivotal role in channelizing the communication informally . They refer the professionals to different information sources to get the relevant International Journal of Digital Library Services 27 | III JJJ OOO DDD LLL SSS VVVooolll . . . 222 , , , AAAppprrriiilll - - - JJJuuunnneee , , , 222000111222 , , , IIIssssssuuueee - - - 222 wwwwwwwww . . . iiijjjooodddlllsss . . . iiinnn ( ( ( IIISSSSSSNNN : : : 222222555000 - - - 111111444222 ) ) ) information . Perhaps , the busy schedule of the practitioners has made them to depend on these resources . Majority of them ( 80 % ) use the Secondary Sources regularly while as 11 % use occasionally . They believe in browsing library collection or surfing through Internet and getting the information by chance . They also use science databases and indexes in any format e . g . , Index Medicus or MEDLINE , Current Contents , Science Citation Index , Biological Abstracts , Chemical Abstracts etc . About 7 % and 33 % of professionals do not report the use of Secondary Sources and Tertiary Sources respectively . 30 . 5 % and 20 % use the Tertiary Sources at times and occasionally ( once every few months ) likewise .

PURPOSE OF ATTENDING SCIENTIFIC MEETINGS / SEMINARS / CONFERENCES / CME LECTURES The state - of - the - art of medicine is ever expanding and ever changing . Having current medical knowledge and skills is very important in providing high - quality healthcare to patients and education to students . It is important for medical professionals to recognize this fact so that up - to - date treatment / care can be provided to patients , and education to students at all times . It is well known that medical knowledge acquired becomes obsolete over a period of five to ten years from the time of completion of studies , which ultimately affects patient care . Therefore , participating in continuing medical education ( CME ) programmes , scientific meetings , seminars , conferences , congresses , etc update the knowledge base of professionals by sharing information about new cutting - edge medical treatments and techniques with other medical professionals . It is observed that in J & K , 174 ( 78 % ) Physicians / surgeons attend scientific meetings , seminars , conferences , congresses , CME lectures etc . Majority of them ( 84 % ) find seminars , conferences etc very useful which provide new ideas and directions to them . They find out the current trends of diagnosis , management , prevention and control of conditions in International Journal of Digital Library Services 28 | III JJJ OOO DDD LLL SSS VVVooolll . . . 222 , , , AAAppprrriiilll - - - JJJuuunnneee , , , 222000111222 , , , IIIssssssuuueee - - - 222 wwwwwwwww . . . iiijjjooodddlllsss . . . iiinnn ( ( ( IIISSSSSSNNN : : : 222222555000 - - - 111111444222 ) ) ) the health practice . Most of them ( 70 % ) find seminars , meetings , conferences etc very supportive , which acquaint them with the work done by others , while as about 20 % of the physicians / surgeons them useful . They imbibe new methods and techniques and put them into practice . However , few physicians / surgeons ( 3 % ) consider them not much useful . Physicians / surgeons ( 38 . 5 % ) agree that scientific meetings , seminars , workshops etc . are very effective , which enable them to share their work or experiences with others . Majority of them ( 58 % ) find them practical . They get opportunity to share problems and ideas with others . However , only 3 % of physicians / surgeons view these sources less useful . About 49 % agree on attending meetings , seminars , conferences etc . being very effective , which enable them to establish new contacts , while as about 46 % of the physicians / surgeons accept them beneficial . They get chance to network with peers to share and exchange information . However , merely 5 % of the practitioners not term these more useful . Physicians / surgeons ( 24 % ) refer seminars , demonstrations , and lectures etc . very useful , which provide them information not available from other sources . Most of the practitioners ( 74 % ) find them informative , believing them to be excellent informal source of knowledge with ease of time . However , few physicians / surgeons ( 2 % ) do not term them more useful . About ( 45 % ) consider scientific meetings , seminars etc very useful which provide them opportunity to discuss , while as about 55 % of the physicians / surgeons find them useful for the same purpose .

SOURCES OF INFORMATION : USE AT PROFESSIONAL LOCATION The physicians / surgeons ( 37 % ) report that they consult their professional colleagues having more experience and expertise at work place to get answers to clinical and research questions . About 21 % search for information through print sources while 14 % get information both through discussion with colleagues and print sources . Practitioners in the focus group report that the rapid telephone consultations are highly useful . In addition , many practitioners rate colleagues as their most valued source of information . To adopt a clinical advance , they discuss an issue with a colleague and conduct a literature search to obtain more information . Only 11 % consult both colleagues and electronic sources , 7 % use both print and electronic sources , and 6 % make use of only electronic sources to obtain information at work which shows limited use of electronic sources at the practice sites .

ONLINE DATABASE SEARCHING FREQUENCY The Internet is increasingly an important resource of medical information for the medical professionals . Majority of the physicians / surgeons 132 ( 58 % ) use Internet to seek medical information . Physicians / surgeons ( 34 % ) and ( 22 % ) access MEDLINE weekly and daily respectively , while as ( 17 % ) and ( 11 % ) access it on monthly and yearly basis . Also , MEDLINE has an impressive coverage of biomedical research findings with abstracts and in some cases free full - text articles from PubMed Central , Biomed Central , Bioline International , Directory of Open Access Journals ( DOAJ ) and other digital archives . Many of the professionals who search MEDLINE / PubMed are confident of getting relevant medical information that will serve their needs . That is why many of the professionals search this database . Another important reason MEDLINE / PubMed is used more instead of other databases is that most of the other databases such as EMBASE require a subscription before they can be accessed . PubMed is popular because it is free on the Internet . Also , the availability of online books through PubMed is the reason why many of the respondents rely on this database for needed medical information . The database has a broad coverage of the biomedical and allied health literature making it an attractive option for many medical professionals .

Practitioners use colleagues frequently at the work place , and that accessibility is an important factor influencing the use of information sources . In addition to accessibility other factors like relevance , currency , understandability , comprehensiveness of information source are clearly important in the process of information - gathering . Some of the practitioners use Internet especially the World Wide Web to find and exchange medical information . Some of them frequently use online bibliographic databases . Majority of the practitioners suggest for availability of Internet facilities at work place and establishment of libraries in every medical institution a compulsory component . The knowledge of how to use and customize online services should be developed by special training programmes . Library and bibliographic instruction would enlarge the practitioner’s familiarity with information sources ; familiarity would enhance perceptions of an information source as being accessible .
