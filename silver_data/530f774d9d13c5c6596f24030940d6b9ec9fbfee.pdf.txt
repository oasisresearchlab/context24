Cytoskeletal reorganization is es - sential for platelet activation and secre - tion . The small GTPase Cdc42 has been implicated as an important mediator of ﬁlopodia formation and exocytosis in vari - ous cell types , but its exact function in plateletsisnotestablished . Here , weshow that the megakaryocyte / platelet - speciﬁc loss of Cdc42 leads to mild thrombocyto - penia and a small increase in platelet size in mice . Unexpectedly , Cdc42 - deﬁcient platelets were able to form normally shaped ﬁlopodia and spread fully on ﬁ - brinogen upon activation , whereas ﬁlopo - dia formation upon selective induction of GPIb signaling was reduced compared with wild - type platelets . Furthermore , Cdc42 - deﬁcient platelets showed en - hanced secretion of (cid:1) granules , a higher adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) / adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) content , increased aggregation at low agonist concentra - tions , and enhanced aggregate formation on collagen under ﬂow . In vivo , lack of Cdc42 resulted in faster occlusion of fer - ric chloride – injured arterioles . The life span of Cdc42 - deﬁcient platelets was markedly reduced , suggesting increased clearing of the cells under physiologic conditions . These data point to novel multiple functions of Cdc42 in the regula - tion of platelet activation , granule organi - zation , degranulation , and a speciﬁc role in GPIb signaling . ( Blood . 2010 ; 115 ( 16 ) : 3364 - 3373 ) Introduction At sites of tissue trauma , platelets become activated and rapidly aggregate to form a plug that seals the wound and limits blood loss . On the other hand , platelet activation in pathologic situations can lead to thrombosis , causing myocardial infarction or stroke . Platelet activation by multiple signaling pathways leads to shape change , release of intracellularly stored granules , and spreading on immobilized ligands . Small GTPases of the Rho family , namely RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 , are thought to play important roles in the cytoskeletal rearrangements occurring during platelet activation by facilitating the formation of stress ﬁbers , ﬁlopodia and lamellipo - dia , respectively . 1 In platelets , signaling from G protein – coupled receptors , such as the thromboxane or thrombin receptors , as well as immunoreceptor tyrosine - based activation motif ( ITAM ) – coupled receptors ( GPVI , CLEC - 2 ) was shown to induce activation of Rho GTPases . 2 , 3 Cdc42 is a small ( (cid:1) 23 kDa ) protein that cycles between a GDP - bound inactive and a GTP - bound active state . 4 Cdc42 is an important mediator of ﬁlopodia formation in various cell types . According to the “convergent elongation model , ” active Cdc42 induces activation of Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASP ) . WASPsubsequently activates theARP2 / 3 complex , thereby increas - ing actin turnover and initiating the formation of parallel actin bundles . 5 - 7 Furthermore , Cdc42 can also bind to and activate IRSp53 , which recruits the Ena / vasodilator - stimulated phosphopro - tein ( VASP ) family protein Mena , thus promoting ﬁlopodia elonga - tion . 6 , 8 However , recent studies suggest that ﬁlopodia formation can also occur independently of Cdc42 , involving most notably the novel Rho GTPase Rho - in ﬁlopodia ( Rif ) and the lipid - phosphatase – related protein - 1 ( LPR1 ) . 9 , 10 Importantly , genetic targeting demon - strated that Cdc42 is not required for ﬁlopodia formation in embryonic ﬁbroblastoid cells . 11 Cdc42 has also been shown to be crucially involved in exocytosis in different cell types , such as neuroendocrine 12 , 13 and MIN6 beta cells , 14 - 16 as well as endothelial cells . 17 , 18 Furthermore , in the hematopoietic system , Cdc42 activation was postulated to be essential for antigen - stimulated degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia ( RBL ) mast cells . 19 , 20 In platelets , 2 different types of releasable granules exist : (cid:2) granules contain various proteins , including growth factors , and thrombogenic proteins , such as thrombospondin , ﬁbronectin , and von Willebrand factor ( VWF ) , which promote platelet activation and aggregation . Dense granules contain small molecules , notably adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , as well as histamine and serotonin . 21 Upon platelet activation with strong agonists , these granules are ﬁrst centralized and then secreted , 22 , 23 which is essential for the recruitment of further platelets , thereby promoting platelet aggregation and thrombus growth . Despite a number of previous studies on the function of Cdc42 in platelets , its role in platelet activation and cytoskeletal reorgani - zation , as well as its impact on degranulation and thrombus formation , is currently unclear .

Platelet aggregation using PRP was induced by addition of CRP , collagen , U46619 , or ADP . Thrombin - induced aggregation was performed with washed platelets . Platelet agglutination was induced in washed platelets by addition of 5 (cid:6) g / mL botrocetin and 10 (cid:6) g / mL human VWF in the presence of 40 (cid:6) g / mL integrilin . Flow cytometry and Western blot analysis A total of 50 (cid:6) L of blood was washed twice in PBS and diluted 1 : 20 in Tyrode - HEPES buffer containing 2mM CaCl 2 . Samples were activated with agonists at the indicated concentrations , stained with ﬂuorophore - conjugated monoclonal antibodies at saturating concentrations for 10 min - utes at 37°C and analyzed on a FACSCalibur ( BD Biosciences ) . For Western blot analysis , blotted platelet lysates were probed with anti - Cdc42 antibody ( 1 (cid:6) g / mL ) and anti – mouse IgG - HRP .

VWF content was measured by ELISA using uncoupled and peroxidase - coupled hVWF antibodies ( DAKO ) . Measurement of total platelet nucleotide content Platelets were suspended in Tyrode albumin buffer , and proteins were precipitated with ice - cold 6 . 6 N perchloric acid . After centrifugation , nucleotides were isolated from supernatants with trioctylamine and freon ( vol / vol ) andmeasuredbyhigh - performanceliquidchromatography ( HPLC ) as described . 30 Determination of platelet life span Mice were injected intravenously with Dylight - 488 – conjugated anti - GPIX Ig derivative ( 0 . 5 (cid:6) g / g body weight ) . At 1 hour after injection ( day 0 ) , as well as at the other indicated time points , 50 (cid:6) Lof blood were collected and the percentage of GPIX (cid:3) platelets was determined by ﬂow cytometry . Bleeding time Tail bleeding time experiments were performed as described . 31 Intravital microscopy of thrombus formation in FeCl 3 - injured mesenteric arterioles Intravital microscopy was performed as described . 31 Brieﬂy , mice were anesthetized , and the mesentery was exteriorized . Injury was induced by topical application of 20 % FeCl 3 . Arterioles were visualized at 10 (cid:7) with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope ( 10 (cid:7) / 0 . 25 objective ) equipped with a 100 - W HBO ﬂuorescent lamp source and a CoolSNAP - EZ camera ( Visitron ) . Digital images were recorded and analyzed off - line using Metavue software . Adhesion and aggregation of ﬂuorescently labeled platelets in arterioles was monitored for 40 minutes or until complete occlusion occurred ( blood ﬂow stopped for more than 1 minute ) . Data analysis Results are shown as mean plus or minus SD from at least 3 individual experiments per group . Statistical analysis between wild - type and Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) groups were assessed by the Mann - Whitney U test . P values less than . 05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant . Results Constitutive deletion of the Cdc42 gene results in embryonic lethality in mice . 32 To study the function of Cdc42 in platelets , mice carrying a Cdc42 gene ﬂanked by loxP sites 24 were crossed with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the megakaryocyte - and platelet - speciﬁc platelet factor ( PF ) 4 pro - moter . 25 In resulting Cdc42 ( ﬂ / ﬂ cre (cid:3) ) mice , gene deletion was induced intrinsically upon induction of the PF4 promoter during megakaryocyte maturation . Cdc42 ( ﬂ / ﬂ cre (cid:4) , further referred to as wild - type ) mice derived from the same litters served as controls . The absence of Cdc42 protein in Cdc42 ( ﬂ / ﬂ cre (cid:3) , further referred to as Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) ) mice was conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis of platelet lysates using GPIIIa expression levels as loading control ( Figure 1A ) . Megakaryocyte - and platelet - speciﬁc deletion of Cdc42 resulted in a moderate thrombocytopenia with platelet counts ranging between 50 % and 80 % of controls ( Figure 1B ) , indicating a signiﬁcant but not essential role for Cdc42 in megakaryocyte differentiation and / or platelet formation . Platelet size was moderately increased in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) animals , as revealed by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) and determination of the platelet width ( Figure 1C - D ) , as well as by ﬂow cytometric assessment of the forward scatter signal ( Table 1 ) . Expression of major platelet surface receptors was similar to controls with exception of subunits of the GPIb / V / IX complex , where expression levels were decreased by approximately 20 % compared with wild - type platelets ( Table 1 ) . Cdc42 (cid:2) / (cid:2) platelets form ﬁlopodia and fully spread on ﬁbrinogen Cdc42 has been demonstrated to be crucial for ﬁlopodia formation in various cell types , and also an essential role for ﬁlopodia formation in platelets has been reported . 33 To test this directly , wild - type and Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets were allowed to spread on a ﬁbrinogen - coated surface in the presence of thrombin ( 0 . 01 U / mL ﬁnal concentration : Figure 2A - B ) . Surprisingly , Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets formed ﬁlopodia to a similar extent and with similar kinetics as wild - type platelets , and after 30 minutes , the rate of fully spread platelets was comparable between the 2 groups ( Figure 2B ; supplemental Videos 1 and 2 , available on the Blood Web site ; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article ) . The ﬁlopodia formed in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets ( Figure 2A bottom panel ) were microscopically indistinguishable from those formed in wild - type platelets ( Figure 2A top panel ) . Likewise , Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) and wild - type platelets exhibited similar morphology and ﬁlopodia structure upon adhesion on ﬁbrinogen under either unstimulating conditions ( Figure 2C ) or upon activation with 5 (cid:6) M ADP ( data not Table 1 .

These data demonstrate that Cdc42 is not required for ﬁlopodia formation and spreading of platelets on a ﬁbrinogen matrix . For a more detailed analysis of the cytoskeletal ultrastructure in Cdc42 - deﬁcient platelets , scanning electron microscopic studies were performed ( Figure 3 ) . Apart from their increased size , no morphologic differences between resting Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) and wild - type platelets were noted ( Figure 3A ) ; moreover , thrombin - induced ﬁlopodia ( 30 minutes ) were not different in length or shape between the 2 groups ( Figure 3B ) . To also study the impact of Cdc42 deﬁciency on platelet shape change in suspension , washed platelets were activated with ADP or thrombin under stirring conditions for 15 seconds and visualized by SEM ( Figure 3C ) . Under these conditions , Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) and control platelets displayed similar morphology , including a contracted cell body and the formation of numerous ﬁlopodia . Taken together , these results reveal normal formation and structure of ﬁlopodia and normal spreading morphology as well as normal agonist - induced shape change in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets . Cdc42 (cid:2) / (cid:2) platelets exhibit reduced ﬁlopodia extension after adhesion on immobilized VWF We next evaluated the platelet response upon adhesion to a mouse VWF – coated surface under conditions of integrin (cid:2) IIb (cid:5) 3 blockade ( Figure 3D ) . Under these conditions , a GPIb - speciﬁc signal is triggered , resulting in shape change that is limited to contraction of the cell body and ﬁlopodia formation . 34 In contrast to control platelets , which efﬁciently extended ﬁlopodia ( 75 % showing more than 3 ﬁlopodia ) , Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets exhibited a profound decrease in the ability to form ﬁlopodia , with most displaying no ( 25 % ) or less than 4 ( 50 % ) ﬁlopodia per platelet and the inability to contract their cell body . Importantly , the observed defect in ﬁlopodia formation in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets was not caused by decreased GPIb Figure 2 .

Cdc42 IN PLATELETS 3367 BLOOD , 22APRIL 2010 (cid:1) VOLUME 115 , NUMBER 16 For personal use only . on July 16 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From expression levels of the protein because GPIb - dependent agglutina - tion by botrocetin and human VWF was unaltered in the mutant platelets compared with that of controls ( Figure 3E ) . Furthermore , ﬁlopodia formation upon static adhesion on CRP , which acts via GPVI and has been proposed to induce similar signaling events compared with GPIb , occurred to a similar extent in wild - type and Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets ( supplemental Figure 1 ) . Together , these results suggest a speciﬁc role of Cdc42 in ﬁlopodia formation downstream of GPIb in a signaling pathway differing from that triggered by GPVI or G protein – coupled receptors . Increased secretion in Cdc42 (cid:2) / (cid:2) platelets Cdc42 is required for exocytotic processes in various cell types , such as mast cells , where it was shown to be crucially involved in antigen - stimulated secretion . 19 , 20 To address a possible role of Cdc42 in this process in platelets , we tested the ability of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) and wild - type platelets to release granules upon agonist activation ( Figure 4 ) . In parallel , activation of the main platelet integrin , (cid:2) IIb (cid:5) 3 , was assessed . 35 Surprisingly , and in contrast to studies in other cell types , we found that P - selectin expression was not decreased but markedly increased in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) compared with wild - type platelets in response to all tested strong agonists ( Figure 4A ; bottom panel ) . In line with this , release of PF4 , a protein speciﬁcally stored in platelet (cid:2) granules , was also moderately but signiﬁcantly increased in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets upon activation com - pared with the control ( Figure 4B ) . In contrast , integrin (cid:2) IIb (cid:5) 3 activation in response to strong stimuli was moderately decreased in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets compared with wild - type ( Figure 4A top panel ) . The increased levels of P - selectin expression and PF4 release in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets indicated enhanced secretion of (cid:2) granules . To test whether release of dense granules was also affected , we measured the amount of released ATP and serotonin upon agonist stimulation ( Figure 4C ) . We found strongly increased ATP release in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) compared with wild - type platelets in response to thrombin and CRP ( Figure 4C top panel ) , whereas serotonin release was not signiﬁcantly different compared with wild - type ( Figure 4C bottom panel ) . TEM revealed comparable numbers of (cid:2) and dense granules in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) and control platelets ( data not shown ) and no signiﬁcant differences between wild - type and mutant cells were found in the total amount of the representative (cid:2) - granular proteins P - selectin , PF4 , and VWF ( supplemental Figure 2A - C ) . Thus , together with the results from ﬂow cytometry and PF4 release , these data support the hypothesis of increased (cid:2) granule – dependent secretion in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets . In contrast , the amount of dense granule - speciﬁc ADP and ATP was signiﬁcantly increased in resting Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets ( wild - type : ADP (cid:9) 1 . 28 (cid:8) 0 . 02 ; ATP (cid:9) 4 . 61 (cid:8) 0 . 14 vs Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) : ADP (cid:9) 2 . 0 (cid:8) 0 . 112 , ATP (cid:9) 5 . 56 (cid:8) 0 . 12 ; P (cid:9) . 025 and P (cid:10) . 001 ; supplemental Figure 2D ) , whereas levels of serotonin were not signiﬁcantly altered ( supplemental Figure 2E ) . The observed increasedADP / ATPcontent may to a certain extent be related to the increased size of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets compared with the control . Alternatively , speciﬁc alterations in the process of granule packing may also contribute to the observed enhanced ADP / ATP secretion from dense granules in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets . Enhanced aggregation of Cdc42 (cid:2) / (cid:2) platelets at low agonist concentrations To study the functional consequences of the increased granule content and secretion and slightly decreased (cid:2) IIb (cid:5) 3 integrin activa - tion in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets , we performed aggregation studies ( Figure 5 ) . Whereas the overall maximal aggregatory response to all tested agonists was similar in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) and wild - type platelets , strongly enhanced aggregation of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets was seen at threshold concentrations of the thromboxane A2 analog U46619 , CRP , and collagen ( Figure 5B - C ) . The degree of aggregation in response to these agonists is known to be strongly dependent on released secondary mediators , indicating that the enhanced secre - tion of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets accounted for this effect . Consistent with this , aggregation in response to the weak agonist ADP , which alone does not induce degranulation , was similar in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) and wild - type platelets ( Figure 5A , C ) . No signiﬁcant difference in aggregation between wild - type and mutant platelets could be detected in response to thrombin ( Figure 5A , C ) . Notably , Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets did not aggregate spontaneously upon addition of epineph - rine ( data not shown ) , indicating that they were not per se in a preactivated state under the in vitro conditions used here . Taken together , these data revealed increased agonist - induced secretion and subsequent aggregation in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets . Figure 4 .

To study the effect of enhanced degranulation of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets on aggregate formation under ﬂow , we perfused anticoagulated blood over a collagen - coated surface at a shear rate of 1000 seconds (cid:4) 1 ( Figure 6 ) . A moderate but signiﬁcant increase in aggregate size of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets compared with wild - type platelets was ob - served under these conditions ( Figure 6Aright panels ) , whereas the surface coverage was comparable between the 2 groups ( Figure 6A left panels ) . Cdc42 (cid:2) / (cid:2) platelets display a decreased life span in vivo Because Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets displayed mild thrombocytopenia , we determined the platelet life span in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) and wild - type mice in vivo ( Figure 6B ) . For this , circulating platelets were labeled with a ﬂuorescent noncytotoxic antibody derivative , and the labeled platelet population was monitored over time . After 1 hour ( day 0 ) , more than 90 % of the circulating platelets in control and Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) mice were labeled , and this platelet population gradually decreased over 5 days in wild - type mice , which is in agreement with the approximately 5 - day life span of mouse platelets ( Figure 6B ) . In contrast , a dramatically shortened life span was seen in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) mice , with a decrease to 39 . 8 % plus or minus 7 . 6 % and 0 % on days 1 and 3 , respectively . This result clearly demonstrates that although Cdc42 deﬁciency has only moderate effects on platelet function ex vivo , it signiﬁcantly affects their homeostatic function in vivo , resulting in a markedly increased turnover , which may , at least in part , account for the moderate thrombocytopenia seen in these animals . Accelerated arterial occlusive thrombus formation but prolonged bleeding times in Cdc42 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice To investigate the effect of Cdc42 deﬁciency on thrombus forma - tion in vivo , we monitored platelet accumulation at sites of ferric chloride – induced mesenteric arteriole injury using intravital ﬂuo - rescence microscopy ( Figure 7 ) .

Cdc42 IN PLATELETS 3369 BLOOD , 22APRIL 2010 (cid:1) VOLUME 115 , NUMBER 16 For personal use only . on July 16 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Cdc42 - deﬁcient mice ( Figure 7A ) , the interval between the forma - tion of ﬁrst thrombi and complete occlusion of the respective arteriole was signiﬁcantly shorter in Cdc42 - deﬁcient animals ( Figure 7B ) compared with wild - type controls . Within 6 minutes after appearance of the ﬁrst thrombus larger than 10 (cid:6) m , vessel occlusion occurred in 60 % of the Cdc42 - deﬁcient animals ( 9 of 15 ) , whereas no vessel occlusion was observed in arterioles of control mice during this time period . To study the effect of Cdc42 deﬁciency on hemostasis , we performed tail bleeding experiments ( Figure 6C ) . Very unexpect - edly , a signiﬁcant hemostatic defect was detectable in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) mice . Whereas bleeding stopped in all control mice within 10 min - utes ( mean , 5 . 9 (cid:8) 2 . 2 minutes ) , bleeding times were highly vari - able and generally increased in Cdc42 - deﬁcient animals ( mean , 13 . 5 (cid:8) 5 . 3 minutes ) . However , all tested animals stopped bleeding within the observation period of 20 minutes . Discussion We have used a knockout approach to investigate the effect of Cdc42 deﬁciency on platelet function in vitro and in vivo . We found that megakaryocyte - and platelet - speciﬁc deletion of the Cdc42 gene resulted in a complex phenotype , including mild thrombocytopenia , increased platelet size and , unexpectedly , in - creased secretion and a shortened platelet life span in mice . On the other hand , our results did not conﬁrm the proposed major role of Cdc42 for ﬁlopodia formation in platelets . 33 We show that Cdc42 is not required for platelet ﬁlopodia formation and full spreading on ﬁbrinogen upon activation with thrombin ( Figure 2A - B ) , as well as for morphologic changes under nonstimulating conditions ( Figure 2C ) or upon stimulation with ADP ( data not shown ) , indicating the involvement of proteins other than Cdc42 in ﬁlopodia formation on ﬁbrinogen under conditions of G protein – coupled signaling . This ﬁnding is in accordance with results from Czuchra et al , who—also using a genetic approach— have demonstrated that Cdc42 is dispensable for ﬁlopodia forma - tion , migration , polarization , and mitosis in embryonic ﬁbro - blasts . 11 Recent data suggest the existence of Cdc42 - independent mechanisms of ﬁlopodia formation , mainly involving the Rho GTPase Rif and LPR1 . 5 , 10 Thus , one of these proteins may act in ﬁlopodia formation in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets . Interestingly , our studies of platelet ultrastructure revealed no differences in ﬁlopodia morphology between Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) and wild - type platelets upon activation ( Figure 3B - C ) , whereas ﬁlopodia induced by Rif and LPR1 were shown to have a longer and more hairy appearance than those induced by Cdc42 . 5 , 9 Thus , further studies are required to identify the mechanisms underlying ﬁlopodia formation in platelets . Notably , however , Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets displayed a clear defect in GPIb signaling - dependent ﬁlopodia formation induced by adhesion on VWF ( Figure3D ) , whichwasmostlikelynotcausedbydecreasedGPIb expression levels because agglutination induced by botrocetin and humanVWF was unaltered in the mutant cells ( Figure 3E ) . This ﬁnding isintriguingbecauseitestablishesCdc42asaGPIb - speciﬁcdownstream - signaling molecule . A role of Cdc42 in platelet ﬁlopodia formation has been previously proposed downstream of the human platelet integrin (cid:2) 6 (cid:5) 1 using secramine A as a Cdc42 - speciﬁc inhibitor . 33 We found that secramine A also prevented the GPIb - dependent response ( data not shown ) , but nonspeciﬁc effects of this compound were suggested by its ability to induce shape change in resting platelets . The signaling pathway downstream of GPIb leading to ﬁlopodia formation remains to be fully characterized . Under our assay condition , which prevents signal ampliﬁcation by (cid:2) IIb (cid:5) 3 integrin , ADP , or TXA 2 , the signaling response evoked by GPIb involves calcium mobilization from intracellular stores downstream of a src kinase and PLC (cid:12) 2 . 36 These effectors are not restricted to GPIb signaling but also take part in GPVI and Fc receptor / ITAM - dependent activation . An increased rather than de - creased response of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets to CRP and collagen and unaltered ﬁlopodia formation upon static adhesion to CRP observed here further supports the notion of a GPIb - restricted role of Cdc42 and indicates the existence of a separate pathway unrelated to those induced by ITAM - coupled receptors . Our ﬁnding is consistent with reports showing biochemical and functional interaction of Cdc42 with 2 known GPIb partners , ﬁlamin 37 and 14 - 3 - 3 . 38 Figure 7 .

A signiﬁcant increase in P - selectin expression and PF4 release despite unaltered protein content strongly indicates en - hanced secretion of (cid:2) granules in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets ( Figure 4A bottom panel ; Figure 4B ) . In contrast , the observed strong increase of dense granule – dependent ATP release coincided with a signiﬁ - cantly increased ADP / ATP content in the mutant platelets that may only partially be explained by their increased size because content and release of the dense granular mediator serotonin was not signiﬁcantly altered ( Figures 1C - D , 4C ; Table 1 ; supplemental Figure 2D - E ) . Thus , the increase in ADP / ATP content might contribute to the hyperreactivity observed in aggregometry , where released mediators accumulate and to a great extent reinforce platelet activation and secretion . However , Cdc42 may also have a direct function in the degranulation machinery , as increased P - selectin exposure was observed also in ﬂow cytometric studies ( Figure 4Abottom panel ) , where highly diluted platelet samples are analyzed under conditions that minimize the inﬂuence of released mediators on the activation state of the cells . 39 Our results stand in contrast to studies by Pula et al , who found that platelets treated with secramine A show a selective aggregation and adhesion defect in response to collagen . 40 This discrepancy is difﬁcult to explain at present , but it might be related to limited speciﬁcity of the inhibitor . The increased secretion in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets stands in clear contrast to observations made in other cell types showing decreased exocytosis upon inhibition of Cdc42 , including endothelial cells and mast cells . 17 , 19 , 20 This indicates that Cdc42 might fulﬁll multiple functions that may differ between cell types or , alternatively , method - ologic differences may account for the discrepant results . We have used a direct genetic approach to delete Cdc42 expression / function in vivo , whereas all studies mentioned here used cell - culture systems and transfection models . Notably , Czuchra et al showed that expression of dominant - negative Cdc42 in Cdc42 - null cells most likely resulted in the inhibition of other Rho GTPases , thereby signiﬁcantly inﬂuencing the observed phenotype . 11 This ﬁnding is in accordance with the observa - tion by Hong - Geller et al , who indeed found an unexplained decrease in exocytosis when overexpressing wild - type Cdc42 in RBL mast cells . 19 Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets formed larger aggregates on collagen under ﬂow in vitro ( Figure 6A ) . Similarly , we found thrombus formation in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) mice to be signiﬁcantly accelerated in an arterial injury model in vivo compared with wild - type platelets ( Figure 7 ) . Considering the increased secretion observed in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets in vitro , one might speculate that this effect was caused by the increased presence of platelet - released thrombogenic factors at the site of injury . This notion would be in line with studies from other groups demonstrating the signiﬁcance of degranulation - dependent release of platelet ago - nists , such as ADP and ATP , for thrombus formation under physiologic conditions . 3 , 41 , 42 Furthermore , our results clearly show that effective thrombus formation can still take place under conditions of decreased circulating platelet numbers . 43 In contrast to these observations , Cdc42 - deﬁcient mice displayed variable but signiﬁcantly prolonged bleeding times , indicating impaired platelet plug formation ( Figure 6C ) . Possibly , the impaired GPIb - dependent signaling ( Figure 3D ) contributes to this effect . Furthermore , decreased GPIb expression levels and decreased integrin (cid:2) IIb (cid:5) 3 activation in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets may also inﬂuence their function in this assay . 44 It is difﬁcult to explain these opposite effects of Cdc42 deﬁciency on platelet function in vivo , but a different relative importance of indi - vidual molecular pathways for plug formation in the tail bleeding assay on the one hand and models of occlusive arterial thrombus formation on the other hand has been shown before . 45 - 47 Our results indicate a novel regulatory role for Cdc42 in platelet activatory / secretory events in vitro and in vivo . Importantly , increased secretion of Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets was not restricted to a speciﬁc agonist but occurred in response to G protein – coupled agonists as well as ITAM - coupled agonists , indicating a general function of the Cdc42 protein in platelet granule content organization and degranulation . In line with this , the increasedADP / ATPcontent suggests that Cdc42 may berequiredforpropergranuleformation / packingduringplateletproduc - tion . Moreover the increased P - selectin expression and PF4 release in Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets indicate that Cdc42 deﬁciency directly leads to enhanced secretion of (cid:2) granules in platelets . At present , the exact role of the regulation of actin cytoskeleton in exocytotic events in platelets is controversial . Several studies using actin - disrupting agents supported a model in which the cytoskeleton in resting platelets may act as a barrier for granule release , and that platelet activation leads to ( partial ) disrupture of actin ﬁlaments , thereby enabling degranulation . 48 How - ever , this model is questioned because of the risk of artefacts caused by actin - disrupting agents . To test a possible effect of Cdc42 deﬁciency on agonist - induced cytoskeletal rearrangements , we examined the Cdc42 downstream effector coﬁlin , a protein known to be involved in increasing actin turnover in its active dephosphorylated form . 49 Unex - pectedly , and in contrast to the currently proposed function of Cdc42 , 50 we found not a decrease , but a strong ( (cid:1) 2 - fold ) increase in the ( inactive ) phosphorylated coﬁlin form in resting Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets compared with controls ( supplemental Figure 3 ) . This ﬁnding is in accordance with a recent study showing increased coﬁlin phos - phorylation in cortical neurons upon genetic Cdc42 deletion . 51 Throm - bin - andCRP - induceddephosphorylationofcoﬁlinoccurredtoasimilar extent and with similar kinetics in wild - type and Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) platelets , although higher levels of the inactive , phosphorylated form of the protein were consistently detected in the mutant cells under all experi - mental conditions ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , we found similar levels of F - actin in resting and thrombin - activated Cdc42 (cid:4) / (cid:4) and wild - type platelets ( data not shown ) , indicating that a reorganization rather than a disassembly of actin might be responsible for the cytoskeletal effects evoked by Cdc42 deﬁciency , but further studies will be required to test this hypothesis . Inadditiontoactinremodeling , Cdc42couldalsoparticipatedirectly or indirectly in the exocytotic processes in platelets . Recently , it became evident that platelets possess a secretory machinery similar to that of other cell types . 52 Thus , Cdc42 may evoke differential signaling events during platelet exocytosis that may be of importance for rapid but controlled platelet degranulation upon activation . Our study has revealed multiple and novel roles for Cdc42 during platelet activation and granule organization / exocytosis , whereas we could not conﬁrm its proposed essential role for ﬁlopodia formation in the cells except under conditions of selective GPIb dependent activation . These ﬁndings point to Cdc42 and / or its downstream effector molecules as potential targets for the development of novel drugs for the regulation of intravascular platelet activation .
