After attachment , virus entry occurs either by direct fusion 34 of the virus envelope with the plasma membrane or via endocytosis followed by fusion between the virus 35 envelope and an endosomal membrane . Upon fusion , de - enveloped virus particles are deposited into the 36 cytoplasm and travel to the nucleus for viral replication . In this report , we examined the mechanism of EHV - 1 37 intracellular trafficking and investigated the ability of EHV - 1 to utilize specific cellular components to 38 efficiently travel to the nucleus post - entry . Using a panel of microtubule depolymerizing drugs and inhibitors of 39 microtubule motor proteins , we show that EHV - 1 infection is dependent on both the integrity of the microtubule 40 network and the minus - end microtubule motor protein , dynein . In addition , we show that EHV - 1 actively 41 induces the acetylation of tubulin , a marker of microtubule stabilization , as early as 15 minutes post - infection . 42 Finally , our data support a role for the cellular kinase , ROCK1 , in virus trafficking to the nucleus . 43 44 Keywords : EHV - 1 , trafficking , microtubules , dynein , ROCK1 45 46 1 . Introduction 47 Equine herpesvirus 1 ( EHV - 1 ) is a major pathogen of horses . Most horses are exposed to the virus within 6 48 months to a year after birth and are frequently re - infected throughout their lifetime ( Allen , 1986 ) . Clinical signs 49 that appear early after infection include fever , inappattence , malaise , coughing , and mucopurulent discharge 50 ( O ' Callaghan et al . , 1983 ) . As the infection progresses , horses may exhibit signs of serious neurological illness 51 including ataxia , disorientation , and partial to full paralysis . In addition to the neurological sequelae , EHV - 1 52 also causes abortigenic disease in pregnant mares . 53 At the cellular level , EHV - 1 must engage host cellular proteins and induce specific signaling pathways very 54 early in infection in order to successfully infect cells . EHV - 1 initially binds to target cells via an interaction 55 between viral glycoproteins B and C and glycosaminoglycans on the plasma membrane ( Sugahara et al . , 1997 , 56 Osterrieder , 1999 ) . After attachment , a putative entry receptor is recognized ( Frampton et al . , 2005 ) by 57 Page 3 of 33 A cc ep t ed M a nu sc r i p t 3 glycoprotein D ( Csellner et al . , 2000 ) . The next step in the EHV - 1 entry pathway varies depending upon the cell 58 type ( Frampton et al . , 2007 ) . EHV - 1 fuses with the plasma membrane and deposits de - enveloped particles into 59 the cytoplasm of equine dermal ( ED ) and rabbit kidney ( RK - 13 ) cells . On the contrary , fully enveloped particles 60 are endocytosed in CHO - K1 cells and naked capsids are then released into the cytosol after the virus fuses with 61 the endosomal membrane . Regardless of the initial mode of entry , we recently showed that the cellular kinase 62 Rho associated coiled - coil kinase 1 ( ROCK1 ) must be induced for the virus to complete the infection process 63 ( Frampton et al . , 2007 ) . 64 Once inside the cells , EHV - 1 must traverse the intricate meshwork of the intracellular cytoskeleton in order 65 to reach the nucleus and deposit the viral genome . The mechanisms employed by EHV - 1 to traffic to the 66 nucleus have yet to be defined , but certain clues are provided by studies with other viruses that utilize 67 microtubules and their associated machinery for intracellular trafficking . Microtubules are composed of  and  68 dimers of tubulin and contain a structural polarity with a positive end that is oriented toward the periphery of 69 the cell and a negative end that is anchored at the microtubule organizing center ( MTOC ) adjacent to the 70 nucleus ( Nogales , 2000 ) . To reach the nucleus , many viruses attach themselves to , and are directionally 71 propelled by dynein , a minus - end directed microtubule motor , towards the MTOC ( Kelkar et al . , 2004 , Alonso 72 et al . , 2001 , Suikkanen et al . , 2003 , Petit et al . , 2003 , Ye et al . , 2000 , Douglas et al . , 2004 , Jacob et al . , 2000 , 73 Raux et al . , 2000 , Florin et al . , 2006 ) . Sodeik et al . initially showed that the alphaherpesvirus herpes simplex 74 virus type 1 ( HSV - 1 ) uses microtubules to traffic to the nucleus . Their data revealed that nuclear transport of 75 HSV - 1 was significantly inhibited in the presence of the microtubule - depolymerizing drugs , nocodazole , 76 vinblastine , or colchicine ( Sodeik et al . , 1997 ) . The movement of HSV - 1 capsids along microtubules was also 77 shown to require dynein as expression of the dynein inhibitor , dynamitin ( Dohner et al . , 2002 ) , and specific 78 inhibitors of dynein ATPase ( Lee et al . , 2006 , Kobayashi et al . , 1978 , Kristensson et al . , 1986 , Penningroth et 79 al . , 1982 ) decreased HSV - 1 transport to the nucleus . The movement of virus particles was also shown to be 80 independent of microtubule turnover or treadmilling ( microtubule polymerization / depolymerization ) as the 81 microtubule - stabilizing drug paclitaxel had no effect on nucleocapsid transport ( Sodeik et al . , 1997 ) . 82 Page 4 of 33 A cc ep t ed M a nu sc r i p t 4 In addition to utilizing microtubules for transport , viruses also generate an intracellular environment that is 83 conducive for nuclear transport by triggering various signaling pathways . One common theme is the induction 84 of signaling pathways that lead to the reorganization of cytoskeletal components . Many viruses , including HSV - 85 1 , stimulate members of the Ras GTPase superfamily and this induction can lead to a wide array of 86 morphological changes of infected cells , including , but not limited to , stabilization of microtubules ( Naranatt et 87 al . , 2005 ) , formation of focal adhesions ( Cheshenko et al . , 2005 ) and endocytosis or phagocytosis ( Clement et 88 al . , 2006 ) . 89 In this study , we show that EHV - 1 causes the stabilization of microtubules via the acetylation of tubulin and 90 utilizes the minus - end directed microtubule motor dynein to traffic to the nucleus along stabilized microtubules . 91 In addition , we show that nuclear accumulation of capsids is decreased in the presence of the ROCK1 inhibitor , 92 Y - 27632 . 93 94 2 . Materials and methods 9596 2 . 1 . Cells , viruses , and plasmids 97 RK - 13 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal 98 bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO - K1 ) cells were kindly provided 99 by Dr .

All cells were maintained at 37  C in 5 % CO 2 . 103 The EHV - 1 recombinant virus L11  gI  gE contains a lacZ reporter cassette in place of gI and gE ( Frampton 104 et al . , 2002 ) . The EHV - 1 recombinant virus L11VP26mRed was described previously ( J . von Einem et al . , 24 th 105 annual ASV meeting 2005 ) . This recombinant virus contains an mRFP1 fluorescent protein fused to the EHV - 1 106 VP26 small capsid protein . 107 108 2 . 2 . Drug inhibition assays 109 Page 5 of 33 A cc ep t ed M a nu sc r i p t 5 For entry assays , 2 . 5 x 10 4 ED or CHO - K1 cells were seeded in a 96 - well plate . The next day , cells were 110 incubated with increasing amounts of the microtubule depolymerizing drugs , nocodazole , vinblastine , 111 colchicine , the microtubule stabilizing drug , paclitaxel ( PTX ) , the dynein inhibitor , EHNA ( erythro - 9 - ( 2 - 112 hydroxy - 3 - nonyl ) adenine , or the kinesin inhibitor AMP - PNP ( adenosine 5  - (  ,  - imido ) triphosphate 113 tetralithium salt ) ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) at 37  C for 30 min . Cells were infected with EHV - 1 ( L11  gI  gE ) at 114 an MOI of 5 and incubated for 5 . 5 h in the presence of the drugs at 37  C . Cells were washed once with PBS and 115 then ONPG was added to the cells and the absorbance read at 405nm . Triplicate samples were measured for 116 each concentration of drug . A 1mM stock of paclitaxel was prepared in distilled H 2 O . One - hundred mM stock 117 solutions of EHNA and nocodazole were prepared in DMSO . A 100 mM stock solution of AMP - PNP was 118 prepared in H 2 O . 10 mM stocks of the ROCK1 inhibitor , Y - 27632 ( EMD Biosciences , La Jolla , CA ) were made 119 in H 2 O . 10mM stocks of vinblastine , and colchicine were also made in H 2 O . Cell viability was measured in 120 triplicate using the CellTiter 96 aqueous non - radioactive cell proliferation assay ( Promega , Madison , WI ) 121 following the manufacturer’s protocol . 122 123124 2 . 3 . Western Blot Analyses 125 Confluent ED cells in a 12 - well plate were serum starved for 1 h and cells were then mock - treated or treated 126 with paclitaxel ( 10  M ) or Y - 27632 ( 100  M ) . Cells treated with paclitaxel were washed with MEM at 15 , 30 , 127 and 60 min and cell lysates were harvested with PARP lysis buffer ( 6 M urea , 2 % SDS , 10 % glycerol , 62 . 5 mM 128 Tris - HCl , pH 6 . 8 , and 5 %  - mercaptoethanol ) . Mock - treated cells or cells treated with Y - 27632 were infected 129 with EHV - 1 ( L11VP26mRed ) at an MOI of 10 in the presence or absence of Y - 27632 . At 15 , 30 , and 60 min 130 post - infection , cells were washed once with MEM and lysates were harvested with PARP lysis buffer . Samples 131 were run on a 10 % SDS - PAGE gel and transferred to an immobilon - P membrane ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . 132 The membranes were blocked for 1 h in 10 % non - fat dry milk ( NFDM ) at room temperature ( RT ) before 133 monoclonal anti - acetylated tubulin antibody 6 - 11B - 1 ( Sigma ) was added at a concentration of 1 : 2000 in TBST 134 with 5 % NFDM for 16 h at 4  C . The membranes were washed 3x for 10 min / wash and then anti - mouse - HRP 135 Page 6 of 33 A cc ep t ed M a nu sc r i p t 6 antibody SC - 2031 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) was added at a concentration of 1 : 3 , 000 in 136 TBST with 5 % NFDM for 1 h at RT . Membranes were washed 3x for 10 min / wash then ECL detection reagent 137 ( Amersham Biosciences , Buckinghamshire , England ) was added and the membranes exposed to film . After 138 stripping the membrane with stripping buffer ( 10 % SDS , 0 . 5M Tris pH 6 . 8 , 0 . 5 %  - mercaptoethanol ) for 30 139 min at 50  C , the membranes were washed 2x for 10 min / wash with TBST and then blocked for 1 h with 10 % 140 NFDM . Total tubulin was detected by adding monoclonal anti -  - tubulin antibody B - 5 - 1 - 2 ( Sigma ) at 1 : 2 , 000 141 for 16 h at 4  C with the secondary antibody and detection steps as described earlier . 142 143 2 . 4 . Infectious virus recovery assay 144 4 x 10 5 cells in 24 - well plates were incubated with 100  M of Y - 27632 in DMEM or DMEM alone for 30 145 min at 37  C . Plates were placed on ice for 5 min and then EHV - 1 ( MOI = 10 ) in DMEM or DMEM containing 146 100  M Y - 27632 was incubated on the cells at 4  C for 3 h . Cells were washed once with cold DMEM and then 147 warm media ( 37  C ) was added to the cells . At each time - point , cells were washed with glycine ( pH 3 . 0 ) for 30 148 s , washed once with DMEM , and harvested . Virus samples were freeze - thawed once then sonicated 3x for 15 s . 149 Virus harvested from each time - point was titered on RK13 cells . Triplicate samples were measured for each 150 time - point . 151 152 2 . 5 . Confocal microscopy of EHV - 1 infected cells 153 CHO - K1 cells were seeded to confluency in collagen - coated 35 mm dishes ( MatTek Corporation , Ashland , 154 MA ) . Cells were mock - treated or treated with 100  M Y - 27632 or 10  M paclitaxel for 30 min at 37  C . Cells 155 were chilled on ice for 10 min and then L11VP26mRed was added to the cells at an MOI of 10 . Virus was 156 incubated on the cells at 4  C for 2 h in the presence or absence of drug . After 2 h , cells for the 0 time - point were 157 fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) at 4  C . Media pre - warmed to 37  C , with or without drug , was added to 158 the remaining cells and then the cells were fixed with 4 % PFA at 15 , 30 , 60 , and 120 min post temperature shift . 159 After 30 min of fixation with 4 % PFA , cells were rehydrated with PBS for 15 min at 4  C . Cells were washed 160 Page 7 of 33 A cc ep t ed M a nu sc r i p t 7 once more with PBS for 15 min and then cells were examined using an inverted Olympus Fluo - View 1000 161 confocal microscope ( Olympus America Inc . , Center Valley , PA ) . Prior to imaging , cells were stained with 162 Hoechst dye ( 1  g / mL ) and wheat germ agglutinin ( 5  g / mL ) to label the nucleus and plasma membrane , 163 respectively . All images were captured at a 60x magnification . 164 165 3 . Results 166167 3 . 1 . EHV - 1 utilizes microtubules for infection 168 169 To determine if EHV - 1 requires microtubules for infection , a virus entry assay was performed in the 170 presence or absence of microtubule depolymerizing agents . Equine dermal ( ED ) cells were untreated or treated 171 with increasing concentrations of nocodazole , vinblastine , or colchicine for 30 min prior to infection and the 172 drugs were kept on the cells throughout the experiment . Cells were infected with L11  gI  gE , an EHV - 1 173 recombinant virus containing a lacZ reporter gene , at an MOI of 5 for 5 . 5 hours . EHV - 1 infection , as measured 174 by  - galactosidase expression , was significantly inhibited in a dose - dependent manner by all of the drugs . 175 Nocodazole inhibited infection by 80 % at the highest concentration tested ( Figure 1A ) and vinblastine ( Figure 176 1B ) and colchicine ( Figure 1C ) inhibited infection by 82 % and 56 % , respectively . This inhibition of infection 177 was not the result of drug - associated cell toxicity as cell viability was similar for all of the concentrations used . 178 In addition to inhibiting infection on ED cells , these drugs also inhibited infection on CHO - K1 cells ( data not 179 shown ) . These results indicate that an intact microtubule network is required regardless of the mode of EHV - 1 180 entry . 181 To address the importance of microtubule dynamics or treadmilling ( polymerization / depolymerization of 182 microtubules ) in virus transport , microtubules were first stabilized with paclitaxel or left untreated before and 183 during infection with EHV - 1 . Virus entry was assessed by measuring  - galactosidase activity 5 . 5 h post - 184 infection . In both ED ( Fig 2A ) and CHO - K1 ( Fig 2B ) cells , stabilization of microtubules prior to the addition of 185 EHV - 1 had no effect on infection as measured by viral reporter gene expression . To assure that paclitaxel 186 treatment of ED cells induced microtubule stabilization , we examined the acetylation of tubulin , which has been 187 Page 8 of 33 A cc ep t ed M a nu sc r i p t 8 shown to be a reliable indicator of stable or fixed microtubules ( Piperno et al . , 1987 ) . Western blotting was 188 performed to detect acetylated tubulin at 15 , 30 , and 60 minutes post - treatment with 10  M paclitaxel . As 189 shown in Figure 3 , paclitaxel treatment resulted in the hyperacetylation of tubulin as early as 15 minutes post - 190 treatment and the level of acetylation steadily increased the longer the cells were treated with the drug . 191 The ability of EHV - 1 to travel to the nucleus after microtubule stabilization was assessed by infecting CHO - 192 K1 cells with the fluorescently tagged - EHV - 1 recombinant L11VP26mRed in the presence or absence of 193 paclitaxel . This recombinant virus contains a red fluorescent protein fused to the VP26 capsid protein and thus 194 the subcellular localization of this virus can be detected throughout a time course of infection by confocal 195 microscopy . CHO - K1 cells were untreated or treated with 10  M of paclitaxel for 30 minutes and then virus 196 was added and allowed to attach to the cells at 4  C for 2 hours to synchronize the entry process . After 197 attachment , medium warmed to 37  C , with or without addition of the drug , was added to the cells to allow 198 infection to ensue . At 0 and 60 minutes post - temperature shift , cells were stained with Hoechst dye and wheat 199 germ agglutinin to label the nucleus ( blue ) and plasma membrane ( green ) , respectively . As shown in Figure 4 , 200 attached virus ( red ) was detected on the surface of mock - treated and paclitaxel - treated cells at the 0 time - point . 201 At the 60 - minute time - point , a similar number of capsids were observed at the nucleus in both mock - treated and 202 paclitaxel - treated cells . The ability of virus to reach the nucleus after paclitaxel stabilization of microtubules in 203 a manner similar to that observed in mock - treated cells suggests that EHV - 1 is efficiently transported along 204 stable microtubules and that there is not a requirement for a continuous process of microtubule 205 polymerization / depolymerization ( treadmilling ) for successful delivery of EHV - 1 to the nucleus . 206 207 3 . 2 . EHV - 1 infection induces the acetylation of tubulin 208 The ability of EHV - 1 to traffic along stable microtubules led us to ask whether EHV - 1 actively induces the 209 stabilization of microtubules . To test this possibility , we compared the amount of acetylated tubulin between 210 mock and EHV - 1 infected cells by western blot assay . Other viruses , including HSV - 1 ( Elliott and O ' Hare , 211 1998 ) , KSHV ( Naranatt et al . , 2005 , Raghu et al . , 2007 ) and African Swine Fever Virus ( Jouvenet et al . , 2004 ) 212 Page 9 of 33 A cc ep t ed M a nu sc r i p t 9 have been shown to induce the acetylation of tubulin upon infection and in some cases this event has been 213 linked to the activity of Rho - signaling proteins ( Naranatt et al . , 2005 , Raghu et al . , 2007 ) . Since ROCK1 is a 214 proximal effector of Rho signaling , we also tested whether the inhibition of ROCK1 would have any effect on 215 the ability of EHV - 1 to induce the acetylation of tubulin . ED cells were untreated or treated with the ROCK1 216 inhibitor Y - 27632 for 30 min and then either mock - infected or infected with EHV - 1 at an MOI of 10 for 15 , 30 , 217 and 60 minutes . As shown in Figure 5 , EHV - 1 infection resulted in a significant induction of acetylated tubulin 218 as early as 15 minutes post - infection and the amount of acetylated tubulin increased over time . The ROCK1 219 inhibitor had no effect on the ability of EHV - 1 to cause the acetylation of tubulin . These results indicate that 220 EHV - 1 actively induces the acetylation of microtubules and that this process is not dependent upon the 221 activation of ROCK1 . 222 223 3 . 3 . The microtubule motor , dynein , is essential for EHV - 1 infection 224 Dynein is a minus - end directed motor that transports intracellular cargo along microtubules and many 225 intracellular pathogens , including HSV ( Sodeik et al . , 1997 ) , have been shown to utilize dynein for transport to 226 the nucleus . To determine if EHV - 1 needs dynein for efficient transport to the nucleus and thus infection , we 227 utilized the dynein inhibitor , EHNA , which blocks the ability of dynein to hydrolyze ATP ( Ravikumar et al . , 228 2005 , Penningroth et al . , 1982 , Bouchard et al . , 1981 , Dhani et al . , 2003 , Cheung et al . , 2004 ) . ED cells were 229 infected with L11  gI  gE in the presence or absence of EHNA and  - galactosidase expression was measured as 230 an indicator of virus infection ( Fig . 6A ) . As a control , cells were treated with AMP - PNP , which inhibits the 231 plus - end directed motor , kinesin . Infection was significantly reduced in cells treated with EHNA , but not in 232 cells treated with AMP - PNP . At the highest concentration of EHNA tested ( 1 mM ) , infection was inhibited by 233 68 % . Neither drug was toxic to the cells at the concentrations used as measured by an MTS cell viability assay . 234 The inhibition of EHV - 1 infection by EHNA indicates that EHV - 1 utilizes dynein for movement to the nucleus 235 post - entry . 236 Since the initial entry process of EHV - 1 in CHO - K1 cells is different from entry into ED cells , we asked 237 whether dynein was also employed for intracellular movement of EHV - 1 in CHO - K1 cells . Entry of EHV - 1 238 Page 10 of 33 A cc ep t ed M a nu sc r i p t 10 into CHO - K1 cells was also inhibited by EHNA in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig 6B ) . These data suggest that , 239 while the initial entry of EHV - 1 into different cell types is dissimilar , the virus uses the same molecular 240 machinery for transport post - entry . 241 242 3 . 4 . Inhibition of ROCK1 deregulates the intracellular processing of EHV - 1 243 In a previous study , we showed that the activation of ROCK1 is critical for productive EHV - 1 infection 244 ( Frampton et al . , 2007 ) . One possible step that ROCK1 might be required for in the EHV - 1 life cycle is at the 245 initial stage of virus uptake into cells . To test this possibility , we performed an infectious virus recovery assay 246 on CHO - K1 cells in the presence or absence of the ROCK1 inhibitor , Y - 27632 . This assay allows for the 247 recovery of fully enveloped virus particles from endosomal vesicles at different time points post - infection . 248 CHO - K1 cells were untreated or treated with Y - 27632 for 30 min at 37  C ( Fig . 7 ) . Cells were then chilled to 249 4  C and EHV - 1 was added with or without drug and allowed to attach to cells for 3 hours at 4  C . After virus 250 attachment , the temperature was raised to 37  C and virus was incubated on cells for up to 3 hours in the 251 presence or absence of Y - 27632 . At the indicated times post - temperature shift , extracellular virus was 252 inactivated by washing the cells with an acidic buffer , and intracellular virus was harvested and titered as 253 described in materials and methods . No difference was observed in the amount of infectious virus recovered at 254 15 minutes , indicating that ROCK1 did not exert an effect on initial EHV - 1 uptake into cells . However , there 255 was a significant spike in the amount of virus recovered at the 30 - minute time - point in the presence of Y - 27632 . 256 After the 30 - minute time point the amount of virus recovered from untreated and Y - 27632 cells was virtually 257 the same . The increased recovery of virus at 30 minutes in the presence of the ROCK1 inhibitor suggests that 258 ROCK1 mediates its effect at a time post virus entry . 259 260 3 . 5 . Decreased nuclear localization of EHV - 1 in the presence of the ROCK1 inhibitor , Y - 27632 261 To examine if ROCK1 inhibition disrupts EHV - 1 trafficking , CHO - K1 cells were infected with the 262 fluorescent EHV - 1 recombinant virus L11VP26mRed in the presence or absence of the ROCK1 inhibitor , Y - 263 Page 11 of 33 A cc ep t ed M a nu sc r i p t 11 27632 ( Fig . 8 ) . Cells were untreated ( Fig . 8A ) or treated with Y - 27632 ( Fig . 8B ) for 30 minutes at 37  C and 264 then virus was added and allowed to attach to cells for 2 hours at 4  C . After the attachment period , cells were 265 warmed to 37  C to allow for virus entry . Infected cells were fixed and imaged at 0 to 120 minutes post - 266 temperature shift using a confocal microscope . At the 0 time - point , virus particles were attached to the plasma 267 membrane ( yellow circles ) and no particles were observed inside either the untreated or Y - 27632 - treated cells . 268 At 15 minutes post - infection , internal and external virus particles were observed in both groups . Interestingly , 269 as shown in Figure 8A about one - third of the virus particles were localized to the nucleus in the mock - treated 270 cells ( white circles ) at 15 minutes post - infection , but only two virus particles were observed at the nucleus in 271 the Y - 27632 - treated cells ( Fig . 8B ) . Over the course of infection , more virus particles accumulated at the 272 nucleus in the untreated cells ( Fig . 8A ) compared to the cells treated with Y - 27632 ( Fig . 8B ) and the majority of 273 particles in the Y - 27632 - treated cells remained associated with the plasma membrane . These data show that 274 treatment of cells with Y - 27632 significantly inhibits the movement of EHV - 1 to the nucleus and indicate that 275 ROCK1 is critical for the intracellular trafficking of EHV - 1 . 276 277 4 . Discussion 278 Many viruses exploit the cellular machinery to travel intracellularly . One common theme that has emerged 279 as an integral part of the lifecycle of viruses is the co - opting of cellular motors , which are normally used to 280 traffic various cargoes throughout the cell . Upon entry into cells , many viruses bind to molecular motors that 281 are tethered to microtubules [ for review see ( Dohner et al . , 2005 ) ] . Microtubules are dynamic structures that act 282 as cellular tracks , which viruses utilize to move directionally toward the nucleus of the cell where replication 283 ensues . After replication and assembly , viruses utilize another set of cellular motors for egress . Without the use 284 of these cellular motors for transport , viruses would never be able to find their way through the dense and 285 intricate cytoskeletal structures and would thus fail to replicate and release progeny virus . 286 In this study , we show that EHV - 1 utilizes the microtubule network and the minus - end directed motor 287 protein dynein to productively infect cells . Disruption of the microtubular network with the microtubule 288 Page 12 of 33 A cc ep t ed M a nu sc r i p t 12 depolymerizing agents nocodazole , vinblastine , and colchicine inhibited the ability of EHV - 1 to productively 289 infect cells and deliver its payload to the nucleus . In addition , the introduction of dynein , but not kinesin 290 inhibitors , also reduced infection . Interestingly , microtubules and dynein were required for virus trafficking in 291 cells that were infected via an endocytic route or by direct fusion of virus at the plasma membrane . These data 292 suggest at least two possible models for intracellular trafficking of EHV - 1 particles that we have designated as 293 the direct and the indirect trafficking model . In the direct model , nucleocapsids that are still surrounded by some 294 tegument proteins would bind to dynein via a viral capsid or tegument protein and this event would therefore 295 occur only after completion of the fusion event between the viral envelope and either the plasma or endosomal 296 membrane . In the indirect model , EHV - 1 would be transported within an endosome and an endosomal protein 297 or complex would interact with dynein . Virus would then fuse and be released from the endosome once it is in 298 close proximity to the nucleus . The ability of EHV - 1 to enter some cells by direct fusion at the cell membrane 299 implies that a direct interaction between a viral protein and a dynein component most likely has to occur for the 300 virus to traffic to the nucleus . However , since EHV - 1 enters other cell types via an endocytic mechanism , it is 301 possible that the indirect model of trafficking applies in these cells and thus the mechanism of intracellular 302 movement of virus toward the nucleus may be cell - type dependent . Studies are currently underway using 303 L11VP26mRed in conjunction with dynein and endosomal marker antibodies to further explore these models . 304 An intriguing finding from this study is the importance of the Rho kinase , ROCK1 , for intracellular 305 trafficking of EHV - 1 particles . Previously , we showed that inhibition of this kinase significantly reduced EHV - 306 1 infection ( Frampton et al . , 2007 ) , but we did not address the mechanism . In the current study , we showed that 307 treatment with a ROCK1 inhibitor significantly decreased the number of capsids that accumulated at the 308 nucleus suggesting a role for ROCK1 in the intracellular trafficking of EHV - 1 . 309 While this is the first report to connect ROCK1 activation with virus trafficking , previous studies have 310 shown that other molecules involved in the ROCK1 signaling pathway also contribute to virus movement 311 within cells . Naranatt and colleagues reported that inactivation of the RhoA GTPase , which acts directly 312 upstream of ROCK1 , blocks the delivery of KSHV to the nucleus ( Naranatt et al . , 2005 ) . In addition , their data 313 support a model in which virus binding to cells activates RhoA , which in turn leads to microtubule stabilization 314 Page 13 of 33 A cc ep t ed M a nu sc r i p t 13 via acetylation and an increased ability of the virus to traffic towards the nucleus ( Raghu et al . , 2007 ) . This 315 microtubule stabilization was further shown to occur after induction of Dia - 2 ( Naranatt et al . , 2005 ) a member 316 of the diaphanous - related formin family involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements and a downstream effector of 317 RhoA . Consistent with these reports , other groups have shown that many viruses including adenoviruses and the 318 alphaherpesvirus , HSV - 1 , travel along stabilized microtubules . Sodeik et al . showed that stabilization of 319 microtubules with paclitaxel prior to HSV - 1 infection had no effect on the nuclear accumulation of capsids 320 ( Sodeik et al . , 1997 ) and Mabit et al . showed that paclitaxel treatment slightly increased nuclear delivery of 321 capsids ( Mabit et al . , 2002 ) . These studies revealed that microtubule dynamics , or treadmilling , are not required 322 for HSV - 1 capsid trafficking . The finding in our current study that EHV - 1 infection actively induces the 323 stabilization of microtubules and that infection is not negatively affected by the prior stabilization of 324 microtubules suggests a common mechanism of microtubule transport of nucleocapsids that is shared amongst 325 alphaherpesviruses . 326 The connection between EHV - 1 - induced microtubule stabilization , virus trafficking along stabilized 327 microtubules , and the dependence of virus trafficking on ROCK1 function would suggest a direct role for the 328 RhoA - ROCK1 signaling pathway in microtubule stabilization . However , one group showed that while RhoA is 329 required for this effect , it is not mediated through ROCK1 ( Palazzo et al . , 2001 ) . Consistent with these data , our 330 results revealed that the inhibition of EHV - 1 infection by Y - 27632 did not inhibit EHV - 1 - induced stabilization 331 of microtubules . We therefore concluded that the contribution of ROCK1 to virus trafficking is most likely 332 separate from virus - induced microtubule stabilization . 333 The observation that many virus particles remain associated with the plasma membrane in the presence of 334 the ROCK1 inhibitor Y - 27632 suggests other possible roles for ROCK1 in virus trafficking . Two intriguing 335 possibilities are that 1 ) ROCK1 activity is required in order to mediate an interaction between virus and 336 microtubules and / or other cytoskeletal components or 2 ) ROCK1 is required for efficient fusion of the viral 337 envelope with a cellular membrane . Inhibition of either of these processes could account for the inability of 338 EHV - 1 to traffic to the nucleus . Future studies will examine which virus components are involved in the 339 Page 14 of 33 A cc ep t ed M a nu sc r i p t 14 initiation of signaling pathways that lead to both ROCK1 activation and separately the acetylation of 340 microtubules . 341 342 5 . Conclusion 343 In the current study we examined some of the early interactions between EHV - 1 and host cell factors and , in 344 particular , investigated how EHV - 1 utilizes the cell’s microtubular network and associated proteins to 345 efficiently infect susceptible cells . Our results showed that disruption of microtubules by the addition of 346 microtubule - depolymerizing agents and the inhibition of the microtubule motor protein , dynein , significantly 347 abrogated EHV - 1 infection in ED and CHO - K1 cells . Our data also revealed that stabilization of microtubules 348 by paclitaxel prior to infection had no impact on the efficiency of EHV - 1 infection in either cell type . 349 Interestingly , our data showed that microtubules are acetylated very early after infection with EHV - 1 . Whether 350 this acetylation is an absolute requirement for EHV - 1 infection is an intriguing question and efforts are 351 underway to address this possibility . Finally , we showed that inhibition of the cellular kinase ROCK1 with the 352 drug Y - 27632 , inhibited the movement of EHV - 1 capsids to the nucleus . These ROCK1 data follow - up on our 353 earlier study , showing that ROCK1 activation is critical for EHV - 1 infection ( Frampton et al . , 2007 ) . Future 354 studies will aim to define how ROCK1 is activated by EHV - 1 , what specific cellular events are reliant upon this 355 activation , and how these cellular events contribute to a productive infection . Knowledge obtained from these 356 studies may be translated into the development of antiviral compounds that can be used to inhibit the identified 357 critical processes that EHV - 1 needs to complete its pathogenic program within the horse . 358 359 Acknowledgments 360 We thank Patricia Spear for providing the CHO cell lines and Ron Montelaro for the ED cells .

Triplicate 545 cultures of CHO - K1 cells were either mock - treated ( open circles ) or treated with 100  M of Y - 27632 ( closed 546 circles ) for 30 min at 37  C . Cells were chilled on ice for 10 min and then L11  gI  gE at an MOI of 10 was 547 bound to the cells at 4  C for 2h in the presence or absence of Y - 27632 . Cells were washed and cold media was 548 replaced with 37  C media . At the indicated times , cells were treated with an acidic buffer ( pH 3 . 0 ) to inactivate 549 non - internalized virus and the cells were washed with media . Internalized virus was harvested from cells and 550 titered on RK13 cells . 551 552 Fig . 8 .
