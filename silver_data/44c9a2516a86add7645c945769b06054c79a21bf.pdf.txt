THE SIZE OF THE GIANT COMPONENT OF A RANDOM GRAPH WITH A GIVEN DEGREE SEQUENCE Michael Molloy Department of Computer Science University of Toronto Toronto , Canada Bruce Reed Equipe Combinatoire CNRS Universite Pierre et Marie Curie Paris , France June 22 , 2000 Abstract Given a sequence of non - negative real numbers (cid:21)0 ; (cid:21)1 ; : : : which sum to 1 , we consider a random graph having approximately (cid:21)in ver - tices of degree i . In [ 12 ] the authors essentially show that if P i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) (cid:21)i > 0 then the graph a . s . has a giant component , while if P i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) (cid:21)i < 0 then a . s . all components in the graph are small . In this paper we analyze the size of the giant component in the former case , and the structure of the graph formed by deleting that compo - nent . We determine (cid:15) ; (cid:21) 0 0 ; (cid:21) 0 1 : : : such that a . s . the giant component , C , has (cid:15)n + o ( n ) vertices , and the structure of the graph remaining after deleting C is basically that of a random graph with n 0 = n(cid:0)jCj vertices , and with (cid:21) 0 i n 0 of them of degree i . 1 1 Introduction and Overview Perhaps the most studied phenomenon in the (cid:12)eld of random graphs is the behaviour of the size of the largest component in Gn ; p 1 when p = c = n for c near 1 . For c < 1 the size of the largest component is almost surely 2 ( a . s . ) O ( log n ) , for c = 1 the size of the largest component is a . s . (cid:2) ( n 2 = 3 ) , and for c > 1 a . s . the size of the largest component is (cid:2) ( n ) while the size of the second largest component is O ( log n ) ( see [ 8 ] , [ 7 ] or [ 9 ] ) . For c > 1 , this largest component is commonly referred to as the giant component and the point p = 1 = n is referred to as the critical point or the double jump threshold . For c > 1 , we can also determine the approximate size of the giant com - ponent , C , as well as the structure of the graph formed by deleting it . It ' s size is a . s . (cid:15)cn + o ( n ) where (cid:15)c is the unique solution to (cid:15) + e (cid:0)c(cid:15) = 1 , and the graph formed by deleting C is essentially equivalent to G n 0 ; p = dc = n 0 , where n 0 = n(cid:0)jCj = ( 1(cid:0)(cid:15)c ) n + o ( n ) , and dc = c ( 1(cid:0)(cid:15)c ) ( see [ 1 ] or [ 10 ] ) . ( Note that dc < 1 . ) The latter property is referred to as the Discrete Duality Principle . In [ 12 ] , the authors showed that a similar phenomenon occurs among random graphs with a (cid:12)xed degree sequence . Essentially , we considered random graphs on n vertices with (cid:21)in + o ( n ) vertices of degree i , for some (cid:12)xed sequence (cid:21)0 ; (cid:21)1 ; : : : . We introduced the parameter Q = P i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) (cid:21)i and showed that if Q < 0 then a . s . the size of the largest component is O ( ! 2 log n ) , where ! is the highest degree in the graph , and if Q > 0 , then a . s . the size of the largest component is (cid:2) ( n ) , and the size of the second largest component is O ( log n ) . In this paper we re(cid:12)ne our arguments to determine the approximate size of the giant component in such a graph . We also (cid:12)nd an analogue to the Discrete Duality Principle , showing that there is a sequence (cid:21) 0 0 ; (cid:21) 0 1 ; : : : , such that the graph remaining after deleting the giant component , C , is basically equivalent to a random graph on n 0 = n (cid:0) jCj vertices , with approximately (cid:21) 0 i n 0 vertices of degree i for each i . Of course , P i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) (cid:21) 0 i < 0 . To be expeditious , we will state our main theorems here , momentarily postponing the de(cid:12)nition of a well - behaved sparse asymptotic degree se - quence , which was introduced in [ 12 ] . 1 Gn ; p is the random graph with n vertices where each edge appears independently with probability p . 2 We say that a random event En holds almost surely if limn ! 1Pr ( En ) = 1 . 2 Given a sequence of non - negative reals (cid:21)0 ; (cid:21)1 ; : : : summing to one , we set K = P i(cid:21)0 i(cid:21)i , and de(cid:12)ne (cid:31) : [ 0 ; 1 ] ! R as (cid:31) ( (cid:11) ) = K (cid:0) 2(cid:11) (cid:0) X i(cid:21)1 i(cid:21)i (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) 2(cid:11) K (cid:19)i 2 ; and we denote the smallest positive solution to (cid:31) ( (cid:11) ) = 0 ( if such a solution exists ) , by (cid:11)D . Now setting (cid:15)D = 1 (cid:0) X i(cid:21)1 (cid:21)i (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) 2(cid:11)D K (cid:19)i 2 (cid:21) 0 i = (cid:21)i ( 1 (cid:0) (cid:15)D ) (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) 2(cid:11)D K (cid:19)i 2 we have Theorem 1 Let D = d0 ( n ) ; d1 ( n ) ; : : : be a well - behaved sparse asymptotic degree sequence where for each i (cid:21) 0 , limn ! 1 di ( n ) = n = (cid:21)i and for which there exists (cid:15) > 0 such that for all n and i (cid:21) n 1 = 4(cid:0)(cid:15) , di ( n ) = 0 . Suppose that Q ( D ) = P i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) (cid:21)i > 0 . If G is a random graph with n vertices and degree sequence Dn then a . s . the giant component of G has size (cid:15)Dn + o ( n ) . Theorem 2 Let D be a degree sequence meeting the conditions of Theorem 1 . Let G be a random graph with n vertices and degree sequence Dn . A . s . the structure of the graph formed by deleting the largest component , C , from G is essentially the same as that of a random graph on n 0 = n (cid:0) jCj = ( 1 (cid:0) (cid:15)D ) n + o ( n ) vertices , with degree sequence D 0 , for some D 0 = d 0 0 ( n ) ; d 0 1 ( n ) ; : : : , where d 0 i ( n ) = (cid:21) 0 i n + o ( n ) . Now we will recall the relevant de(cid:12)nitions from [ 12 ] . Throughout this paper , all asymptotics will be taken as n tends to 1 and we only claim things to be true for su(cid:14)ciently large n . By A (cid:25) B we mean that limn ! 1 A = B = 1 . De(cid:12)nition : An asymptotic degree sequence is a sequence of integer - valued functions D = d0 ( n ) ; d1 ( n ) ; : : : such that 1 . di ( n ) = 0 for i (cid:21) n ; 3 2 . P i(cid:21)0 di ( n ) = n . Given an asymptotic degree sequence D , we set Dn to be the degree sequence fc1 ; c2 ; : : : ; cng , where cj (cid:21) cj + 1 and jfj : cj = igj = di ( n ) for each i (cid:21) 0 . De(cid:12)ne (cid:10)Dn to be the set of all graphs with vertex set [ n ] with degree sequence Dn . A random graph on n vertices with degree sequence D is a uniformly random member of (cid:10)Dn . De(cid:12)nition : An asymptotic degree sequence D is feasible if (cid:10)Dn 6 = ; for all n (cid:21) 1 . De(cid:12)nition : An asymptotic degree sequence D is smooth if there exist constants (cid:21)i such that limn ! 1 di ( n ) = n = (cid:21)i . De(cid:12)nition : An asymptotic degree sequence D is sparse if P i(cid:21)0 idi ( n ) = n = K + o ( 1 ) for some constant K . De(cid:12)nition : Given a smooth asymptotic degree sequence , D , Q ( D ) = P i(cid:21)1 i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) (cid:21)i . De(cid:12)nition : An asymptotic degree sequence D is well - behaved if : 1 . D is feasible and smooth . 2 . i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) di ( n ) = n tends uniformly to i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) (cid:21)i ; i . e . for all (cid:15) > 0 there exists N such that for all n > N and for all i (cid:21) 0 : j i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) di ( n ) n (cid:0) i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) (cid:21)i j < (cid:15) : 3 . L ( D ) = lim n ! 1 X i(cid:21)1 i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) di ( n ) = n exists , and the sum approaches the limit uniformly , i . e . : ( a ) If L ( D ) is (cid:12)nite then for all (cid:15) > 0 , there exists i (cid:3) ; N such that for all n > N : j i (cid:3) X i = 1 i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) di ( n ) = n (cid:0) L ( D ) j < (cid:15) : ( b ) If L ( D ) is in(cid:12)nite then for all T > 0 , there exists i (cid:3) ; N such that for all n > N : i (cid:3) X i = 1 i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) di ( n ) = n > T : 4 We note that it is an easy exercise to show that if D is well - behaved then : L ( D ) = Q ( D ) : Note that for a well - behaved asymptotic degree sequence D , if Q ( D ) is (cid:12)nite then D is sparse . Note further that if D is sparse and well - behaved then since for i (cid:3) > 1 , P i > i (cid:3) idi ( n ) < P i > i (cid:3) i ( i(cid:0)2 ) di ( n ) , the sum limn ! 1 P i(cid:21)1 idi ( n ) = n approaches its limit uniformly in the sense of condition 3 in the de(cid:12)nition of well - behaved . The main result of [ 12 ] is : Theorem 3 Let D = d0 ( n ) ; d1 ( n ) ; : : : be a well - behaved sparse asymptotic degree sequence for which there exists (cid:15) > 0 such that for all n and i > n 1 4 (cid:0)(cid:15) , di ( n ) = 0 . Let G be a graph with n vertices , di ( n ) of which have degree i , chosen uniformly at random from amongst all such graphs . Then : ( a ) If Q ( D ) > 0 then there exist constants (cid:16)1 ; (cid:16)2 > 0 dependent on D such that G a . s . has a component with at least (cid:16)1n vertices and (cid:16)2n cycles . Furthermore , if Q ( D ) is (cid:12)nite then G a . s . has exactly one component of size greater than (cid:13) log n for some constant (cid:13) dependent on D . ( b ) If Q ( D ) < 0 and for some function 0 (cid:20) ! ( n ) (cid:20) n 1 8 (cid:0)(cid:15) , di ( n ) = 0 for all i (cid:21) ! ( n ) , then for some constant R dependent on Q ( D ) , G a . s . has no component with at least R ! ( n ) 2 log n vertices , and a . s . has fewer than 2R ! ( n ) 2 log n cycles . Also , a . s . no component of G has more than one cycle . Consistent with the model Gn ; p , we call the component referred to in Theorem 3 ( a ) the giant component . To prove Theorem 3 , we worked with the con(cid:12)guration model introduced in this form by Bollob(cid:19)as [ 6 ] and motivated in part by the work of Bender and Can(cid:12)eld [ 4 ] . This model arose in a somewhat di(cid:11)erent form in the work of Bekessy , Bekessy and Koml(cid:19)os [ 3 ] and Wormald [ 13 , 14 ] . A random con(cid:12)gura - tion with n vertices and a (cid:12)xed degree sequence is formed by taking a set L containing deg ( v ) distinct copies of each vertex v , and choosing a random matching of the elements of L . Each con(cid:12)guration represents an underlying multigraph whose edges are de(cid:12)ned by the pairs in the matching . We often 5 abuse notation by referring to a con(cid:12)guration as if it were a multigraph . For example , we say that a con(cid:12)guration has a graphical property P when we mean that its underlying multigraph does , and we discuss the components of a con(cid:12)guration rather than the components of its underlying multigraph . This very useful lemma follows from the main result in [ 11 ] , and allows us to prove results concerning a random graph on a particular degree sequence , by analyzing a random con(cid:12)guration . Lemma 1 Suppose D is a degree sequence meeting the conditions of Theorem 3 for which Q ( D ) < 1 . If a random con(cid:12)guration with degree sequence D a . s . has a property P , then a random graph with degree sequence D a . s . has P . The key to the proof of Theorem 3 is the manner in which we exposed the con(cid:12)guration . Given D , we expose a random con(cid:12)guration F on n vertices with degree sequence D as follows : At each step , a vertex all of whose copies are in exposed pairs is entirely exposed . A vertex some but not all of whose copies are in exposed pairs is partially exposed . All other vertices are unexposed . The copies of partially exposed vertices which are not in exposed pairs are open . 1 . Form a set L consisting of i distinct copies of each of the di ( n ) vertices which have degree i . 2 . Repeat until L is empty : ( a ) Expose a pair of F by (cid:12)rst choosing any member of L , and then choosing its partner at random . Remove them from L . ( b ) Repeat until there are no partially exposed vertices : Choose an open copy of a partially exposed vertex , and pair it with another randomly chosen member of L . Remove them both from L . All random choices are made uniformly . Note that we have complete freedom as to which vertex - copy we pick in Step 2 ( a ) , but for the purposes of this paper , we will choose it in the same manner in which we choose all other vertex - copies , i . e . we will simply pick a uniformly random member of L . It is clear that every possible matching amongst the vertex - copies occurs with 6 the same probability under this procedure , and hence this is a valid way to choose a random con(cid:12)guration . Let Xi represent the number of open vertex - copies after the ith pair is exposed . Initially the expected increase in Xi is approximately P i(cid:21)1 i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) di ( n ) P j(cid:21)1 jdj ( n ) = Q ( D ) K ; explaining the signi(cid:12)cance of our parameter Q ( D ) . Suppose that Q ( D ) is positive , and thus so is the initial expected in - crease in Xi . If this expected increase remained positive throughout the process then a . s . some component would keep growing in size . Of course , the expected increase does not remain positive ; it changes as the set of unex - posed vertices changes . However , we proved that it takes at least (cid:2) ( n ) steps for the expected increase to change signi(cid:12)cantly , and that this was enough time for a component to become giant . In this paper , we gain a better understanding of this process by studying the way in which the expected increase of Xi changes throughout the expo - sure . The key to this will be to keep track of the degrees of the unexposed vertices at each step . Recall that initially there are di ( n ) unexposed vertices of degree i . We will de(cid:12)ne the random variable di ; j to be the number of unexposed vertices of degree i after j pairs of the con(cid:12)guration have been exposed . Thus di ; 0 = di ( n ) (cid:25) (cid:21)in . In the next section , we will determinea sequence of functions Z0 ( (cid:11) ) ; Z1 ( (cid:11) ) ; : : : and prove that a . s . di ; (cid:11)n = Zi ( (cid:11) ) n + o ( n ) . We will do this by solving a system of di(cid:11)erential equations with the property that D 0 i ( (cid:11) ) (cid:25) Exp ( di ; j + 1 (cid:0) di ; j ) ; for j (cid:25) (cid:11)n ; and then applying a recent theorem of Wormald which states that under certain conditions , random variables a . s . behave like the solution to such a system of di(cid:11)erential equations . One of these conditions ( in fact the only one that doesn ' t apply here ) is that the number of variables is bounded . Fortunately , our di(cid:11)erential equations are particularly well - behaved , allowing us to skirt this issue by dealing with the equations individually . Once we have determined what the degree sequence of the set of unex - posed vertices looks like throughout the exposure of the giant component , 7 it will be a simple matter to analyze the size of that component . Further - more , once that component is completely exposed , we will know the degree sequence of the unexposed vertices . The remainder of the graph will have the structure of a random graph on that degree sequence , and this yields the analogue to the Discrete Duality Principle . 2 A Detailed Analysis Recall that a function f ( u1 ; : : : ; uj ) satis(cid:12)es a Lipschitz condition on D (cid:18) R j if a constant L > 0 exists with the property that jf ( u1 ; : : : ; uj ) (cid:0) f ( v1 ; : : : ; vj ) j (cid:20) L j X i = 1 jui (cid:0) vij for all ( u1 ; : : : ; uj ) and ( v1 ; : : : ; vj ) in D . The following theorem appears in a more general form in [ 15 ] . In it , \ uni - formly " refers to the convergence implicit in the o ( ) terms . Hypothesis ( i ) ensures that Yt does not change too quickly throughout the process , ( ii ) tells us what we expect the rate of change to be , and ( iii ) ensures that this rate does not change too quickly . Theorem 4 Suppose Yt ; 0 (cid:20) t (cid:20) m = m ( n ) is a sequence of real - valued random variables , such that 0 (cid:20) Yt (cid:20) Cn for some constant C , and Hj be the history of the sequence , i . e . the array ( Y0 ; : : : ; Yj ) . Suppose further that for some function f : R 2 ! R , ( i ) there is a constant C 0 such that for all t < m and all l , jYt + 1 (cid:0) Ytj < C 0 always ; ( ii ) and uniformly over all t < m , Exp ( Yt + 1 (cid:0) YtjHt ) = f ( t = n ; Yt = n ) + o ( 1 ) always ; 8 ( iii ) the function f is continuous and satis(cid:12)es a Lipschitz condition on D , where D is some bounded connected open set containing the intersection of f ( t ; z ) : t (cid:21) 0g with some neighbourhood of f ( 0 ; z ) : Pr ( Y0 = zn ) 6 = 0 for some ng . Then ( a ) for ( 0 ; ^ z ) 2 D the di(cid:11)erential equation dz ds = f ( s ; z ) has a unique solution in D for z : R ! R passing through z ( 0 ) = ^ z ; and which extends to points arbitrarily close to the boundary of D ; ( b ) Yt = nz ( t = n ) + o ( n ) with probabilty at least 1(cid:0)n (cid:0)1 = 2 uniformly for 0 (cid:20) t (cid:20) minf(cid:27)n ; mg and for each l , where z ( t ) is the solution in ( a ) with ^ z = Y0 = n , and (cid:27) = (cid:27) ( n ) is the supremum of those s to which the solution can be extended . Remark : The only part of Theorem 4 that does not follow directly from the statement of the Theorem 1 in [ 15 ] is the bound on the probability in ( b ) . This is implicit in its proof . Now , suppose that we are given a well - behaved degree sequence D , such that Q ( D ) > 0 . We expose a random con(cid:12)guration , F , with n vertices and degree sequence D using our branching process . It is important to note that with high probability it will not take very many steps before we begin to expose the giant component , as demonstrated by the following lemma . Lemma 2 For any function ! ( n ) ! 1 , ! ( n ) = o ( n logn ) , a . s . the largest component of F will be one of the (cid:12)rst ! ( n ) components exposed . 9 Proof Let E1 be the event that F has a cyclic component of size at least (cid:16)1n , and no other component of size greater than (cid:13) log n , where (cid:16)1 ; (cid:13) are as in Theorem 3 . By Theorem 3 , E1 a . s . occurs . For any con(cid:12)guration with degree sequence D , we say that C is the subset of the components de(cid:12)ned as follows . We consider the components to be sorted (cid:12)rst in non - increasing order of the sizes of their edge sets , and then by decreasing order of their highest labeled vertex . We take C to be the smallest initial sequence of components which contains a total of at least (cid:16)1n edges . Note that if E1 occurs , then C contains only the largest component . Let E2 be the event that one of the (cid:12)rst ! ( n ) components exposed lies in C . Now each time we start a new component , either we have already exposed a member of C , or the probability that a uniformly selected copy of an unexposed vertex lies in C is at least 2(cid:16)1 = K . Therefore , Pr ( E2 ) (cid:21) 1 (cid:0) 1 (cid:0) 2(cid:16)1 K ! ! ( n ) = 1 (cid:0) o ( 1 ) : Clearly , the probability that the largest component is one of the (cid:12)rst ! ( n ) components exposed is at least the probability that E1 and E2 hold , thus proving the lemma . 2 Corollary 1 Almost surely , the blog 2 ncth edge exposed will lie in the largest component of F . Proof This follows immediately from Lemma 2 and Theorem 3 ( a ) . 2 And now we can prove our main Theorems : Proof of Theorem 1 We prove this by analyzing the asymptotic value of di ; j . Clearly di ; 0 = di ( n ) for each i . Consider any (cid:12)xed i0 (cid:21) 1 , and set M = P i(cid:21)0 idi ( n ) . When exposing the ( j + 1 ) st edge , we have exactly M (cid:0) 2j (cid:0) 1 vertex - copies to choose from , i0di0 ; j of which are copies of unexposed vertices of degree i0 . Therefore , if Xj > 0 then the expected change in di0 ; j is : Exp ( di0 ; j + 1 (cid:0) di0 ; j ) = (cid:0) i0di0 ; j M (cid:0) 2j (cid:0) 1 ; and the distribution of this change is mutually independent of the values of di ; j for all i 6 = i0 . 10 Thus , if it were not for the complications which arise when Xj = 0 , it would be straightforward to apply Theorem 4 to di ; j . To deal with these complications , we add two twists to our analysis . The (cid:12)rst is that we begin our analysis at step j = blog 2 nc . Clearly , d i ; blog 2 nc = di ; 0 + o ( n ) for each i . Furthermore , by Corollary 1 , after this step , Xj will almost surely remain positive until after the giant component has been entirely exposed . However , we must still deal with the slim chance that X \ plummets " to 0 prematurely . To do this , we introduce twin random variables (cid:14)i ; j , de(cid:12)ned as follows . For j = 0 , and for each j such that XJ > 0 for all blog 2 nc (cid:20) J (cid:20) j + blog 2 nc , (cid:14)i ; j = d i ; j + blog 2 nc . For any other j , we de(cid:12)ne (cid:14)i ; j = ( (cid:14)i ; j(cid:0)1 (cid:0) 1 ; with probability i(cid:14)i ; j(cid:0)1 M(cid:0)2 ( j(cid:0)1 ) (cid:0)1 (cid:14)i ; j(cid:0)1 ; otherwise . Now , for any (cid:12)xed i0 (cid:21) 1 , by applying Theorem 4 with Yj = (cid:14)i0 : j , C 0 = 1 ; m = n and f ( s ; z ) = (cid:0)iz K(cid:0)2s , we see that with probability at least 1(cid:0)o ( n (cid:0)1 = 2 ) , for every 0 < (cid:11) < 1 , (cid:14) i0 ; d(cid:11)ne = Zi0 ( (cid:11) ) n + o ( n ) ; ( 1 ) where Zi ( (cid:11) ) = di ; 0 (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) 2(cid:11) K (cid:19)i 2 is the unique solution to : Zi ( 0 ) = di ; 0 = n Z 0 i ( (cid:11) ) = (cid:0) iZi ( (cid:11) ) K (cid:0) 2(cid:11) : Since our degree sequence has maximum degree o ( n 1 = 4 ) , a . s . ( 1 ) holds for every i . Note that Xj = M (cid:0) 2j (cid:0) P i(cid:21)1 idi ; j . Thus by applying Corollary 1 and using the fact that D is well - behaved , we have that for any 0 (cid:20) (cid:11) (cid:20) (cid:11)D and any I > 0 , a . s . Xd(cid:11)ne = M (cid:0) 2d(cid:11)ne (cid:0) I X i = 1 idi ; j (cid:0) X i > I idi ; j 11 = Kn (cid:0) 2d(cid:11)ne (cid:0) I X i = 1 idi ( n ) (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) 2(cid:11) K (cid:19)i 2 + S = 0 @ K (cid:0) 2(cid:11) (cid:0) I X i = 1 i(cid:21)i (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) 2(cid:11) K (cid:19)i 2 1 A n + S ; for each 0 (cid:20) (cid:11) (cid:20) (cid:11)D , where jSj < (cid:13)n for some (cid:13) = (cid:13) ( I ) where limI ! 1 (cid:13) ( I ) = 0 , and so a . s . X d(cid:11)ne = (cid:31) ( (cid:11) ) n + o ( n ) ; ( 2 ) and Theorem 1 now follows . 2 Proof of Theorem 2 By Lemma 2 , for any ! ( n ) ! 1 we a . s . expose less than ! ( n ) components prior to the exposure of the giant component . In fact , with probability (cid:15)D , the giant component is the (cid:12)rst component exposed . Upon completion of the exposure of the giant component , the con(cid:12)gura - tion induced by the unexposed vertices is a uniformly random con(cid:12)guration with di ; j vertices of degree i for each i , where j is the number of exposed pairs . By Theorem 1 , this con(cid:12)guration a . s . has n 0 = ( 1 (cid:0) (cid:15)D ) n vertices , (cid:21) 0 i n 0 + o ( n 0 ) of which have degree i . 2 Recall that G a . s . has exactly one component of size greater than (cid:13) log n , so it should not be surprising that P i(cid:21)1 i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) (cid:21) 0 i < 0 , as we will now see . For 0 (cid:20) (cid:11) (cid:20) (cid:11)D , (cid:31) 0 ( (cid:11) ) = (cid:0)2 + ( K (cid:0) 2(cid:11) ) (cid:0)1 X i(cid:21)1 i 2 (cid:21)i (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) 2(cid:11) K (cid:19)i 2 = ( K (cid:0) 2(cid:11) ) (cid:0)1 0 @ X i(cid:21)1 i 2 (cid:21)i (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) 2(cid:11) k (cid:19)i 2 (cid:0) 2 ( K (cid:0) 2(cid:11) ) 1 A (cid:21) ( K (cid:0) 2(cid:11) ) (cid:0)1 0 @ X i(cid:21)1 i 2 (cid:21)i (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) 2(cid:11)D k (cid:19)i 2 (cid:0) 2 X i(cid:21)1 i(cid:21)i (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) 2(cid:11)D k (cid:19)i 2 1 A = ( K (cid:0) 2(cid:11)D ) (cid:0)1 ( 1 (cid:0) (cid:15)D ) X i(cid:21)1 i ( i (cid:0) 2 ) (cid:21) 0 i = ( K (cid:0) 2(cid:11)D ) (cid:0)1 ( 1 (cid:0) (cid:15)D ) Q ( D 0 ) : Furthermore , the inequality is strict for (cid:11) < (cid:11)D , and so Q ( D 0 ) < 0 , as otherwise (cid:11)D could not be the smallest positive zero of (cid:31) ( (cid:11) ) . 12 3 The Model G n ; p We close by noting that some previously known results about G n ; p = c = n are special cases of Theorems 1 and 2 . Select Gn ; p by (cid:12)rst exposing its degree sequence , and then choosing a random graph with that degree sequence . Note that every graph with that degree sequence occurs as Gn ; p with the same probability and so this is a valid method of selection . It is well known that G n ; p = c = n a . s . has c i i ! e (cid:0)c n + o ( n ) vertices of degree i , for each i (cid:20) O ( log n = log log n ) , and no vertices of higher degree . It is straightforward to verify that if this property holds , then K = c , and so in order to apply Theorem 1 we wish to solve : c (cid:0) 2(cid:11) (cid:0) X i(cid:21)1 i c i i ! e (cid:0)c (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) 2(cid:11) c (cid:19)i 2 = 0 : ( 3 ) There are two solutions at (cid:11) = 0 ; c 2 . We will see that there is another and so 0 < (cid:11)D < c 2 . For (cid:11) 6 = 0 ; c 2 , ( 3 ) is congruent to : s c (cid:0) 2(cid:11) c = exp (cid:16)p c 2 (cid:0) 2c(cid:11) (cid:0) c (cid:17) : Now set (cid:15) ( (cid:11) ) = 1 (cid:0) X i(cid:21)1 c i i ! e (cid:0)c (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) 2(cid:11) c (cid:19)i 2 = 1 (cid:0) exp (cid:16)p c 2 (cid:0) 2c(cid:11) (cid:0) c (cid:17) : By Theorem 1 , a . s . the size of the giant component of G n ; p = c = n is (cid:15)n + o ( n ) , with (cid:15) = (cid:15) ( (cid:11)D ) , where (cid:11)D is the smallest positive solution to ( 3 ) . Now , for 0 < (cid:11) < c 2 , (cid:31) ( (cid:11) ) = 0 i(cid:11) : (cid:15) ( (cid:11) ) + e (cid:0)c(cid:15) ( (cid:11) ) = 1 (cid:0) exp (cid:16)p c 2 (cid:0) 2c(cid:11) (cid:0) c (cid:17) + exp (cid:16) (cid:0)c (cid:16) 1 (cid:0) exp (cid:16)p c 2 (cid:0) 2c(cid:11) (cid:0) c (cid:17)(cid:17)(cid:17) = 1 (cid:0) exp (cid:16)p c 2 (cid:0) 2c(cid:11) (cid:0) c (cid:17) 13 + exp 0 @ (cid:0)c 0 @ 1 (cid:0) s c (cid:0) 2(cid:11) c 1 A 1 A = 1 (cid:0) exp (cid:16)p c 2 (cid:0) 2c(cid:11) (cid:0) c (cid:17) + exp (cid:16)p c 2 (cid:0) 2c(cid:11) (cid:0) c (cid:17) = 1 ; thus verifying that a . s . the size of the largest component of G n ; p = c = n is (cid:15)cn + o ( n ) , where (cid:15)c is the unique solution to (cid:15) + e (cid:0)c(cid:15) = 1 . We will now see that the Discrete Duality Principle is a special case of Theorem 1 , by showing that if (cid:21)i = c i i ! e (cid:0)c ; then (cid:21) 0 i = d i c i ! e (cid:0)dc ; ( 4 ) where dc = c ( 1 (cid:0) (cid:15)c ) . It can easily be shown ( see for example [ 1 ] ) that ce (cid:0)c = dce (cid:0)dc , and thus e (cid:0)c 1 (cid:0) (cid:15)c = e (cid:0)dc : Since (cid:15)c = 1(cid:0)exp (cid:16) p c 2 (cid:0) 2c(cid:11) (cid:3) (cid:0) c (cid:17) , dc = cexp (cid:16) p c 2 (cid:0) 2c(cid:11) (cid:3) (cid:0) c (cid:17) . Therefore , cexp ( (cid:0)c ) = dc exp (cid:16) (cid:0) p c 2 (cid:0) 2c(cid:11) (cid:3) (cid:17) , and so dc = q c 2 (cid:0) 2c(cid:11)D : Therefore , (cid:21) 0 i = (cid:21)i 1 (cid:0) (cid:15)c (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) 2(cid:11)D K (cid:19) = c i e (cid:0)c i ! ( 1 (cid:0) (cid:15)c ) (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) 2(cid:11)D c (cid:19) = (cid:18)q c 2 (cid:0) 2(cid:11)Dc (cid:19) i e (cid:0)c i ! ( 1 (cid:0) (cid:15)c ) = d i c i ! e (cid:0)dc ; as claimed , thus verifying the Discrete Duality Principle . 14 Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank Nick Wormald for an early manuscript of [ 15 ] , Noel Walkington for his valuable advice concerning di(cid:11)erential equa - tions , Boris Pittel for his helpful comments , and a referee for some minor corrections .
