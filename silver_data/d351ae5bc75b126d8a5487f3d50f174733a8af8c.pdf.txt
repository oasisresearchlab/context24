L , - ( a l g o r i t h Richard C . Waters , editor Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories 201 Broadway Cambridge MA 02139 Dick @ MERL . COM Most of the articles appearing in this column are oriented toward Common Lisp . However , a wider community of Lisp dialects still exists . One that is of particular interest is GNU Emacs Lisp - - the Lisp that is the implementation language for GNU Emacs and its various user extensions . The following article presents a GNU Emacs Lisp system that supports object ori - ented programming . The article is obviously of interest to anyone who wishes to write object oriented programs in GNU Emacs Lisp . However , it should also be of interest to anyone who is curious about the kinds of implementation techniques that can be used to support basic object oriented operations . Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories ( MERL ) has created a directory structure that can be accessed by anonymous FTP . You should connect to MEI ~ L . C0M ( INTERNET number 140 . 237 . 1 . 1 ) and login as " anonymous " to copy files . From now on , MERL will be the primary repository for the programs I have written for the Algorithms section of Lisp Pointers and all my other publicly available programs . These programs are contained in the files indicated below . / pub / xp / xp * / pub / series / s * / pub / Iptrs / rt * / pub / iptrs / cover * / pub / iptrs / xpx * ; XP pretty printer ; see CLtL2 Chapter 27 ; Support for Series ; see CLtL2 Appendix A ; regression tester ; see Lisp Pointers 4 ( 2 ) ; test case coverage tool ; see Lisp Pointers 4 ( 4 ) ; XP pretty printer example ; see Lisp Pointers 5 ( 1 ) Richard C .
