426 A Bibliography of Articles on Technology in Science Education RANDY BELL AND LYNN BELL Curry School of Education , University of Virginia When leaders from a variety of content - specific education organizations met at the National Technology Leadership Retreat 2001 to discuss technology’s role in education , they were asked why more teacher educators were not integrating educational technology in their instruction ( see Bell , 2001 , for the full list of participants , as well as other issues discussed ) . One of the common issues cited by representatives—including those from the Associa - tion for the Education of Teachers in Science—was the perceived inadequa - cy of the literature supporting technology in education . A limited body of knowledge exists that examines technology’s benefits to student learning , and many teacher educators are unfamiliar with the literature that has been published . Much of the literature discussing technology use in teacher preparation is based on anecdotal evidence . ( Bell , 2001 ) We left the conference curious about whether that perception was accurate specifically in the field of science education . Over the past year we have conducted an extensive search of the education literature to identify articles dealing with the topic of technology in science education . The result of this effort is a bibliography of published articles and book chapters related to applications of technology in K - 12 science teaching or in science teacher preparation . Because technology changes so rapidly , and contemporary research on technology is likely to be most relevant , we chose to include only publica - tions dated 1994 or later ( this was the year Carl Berger and colleagues published their review of the literature on technology in science education in Bell , R . , & Bell , L . ( 2002 ) . A Bibliography of Articles on Technol - ogy in Science Education . Contemporary Issues in Technology and Teacher Education , 2 ( 4 ) , 426 - 446 . 427 the Handbook of Research on Science Teaching and Learning ) . We did not expect to find many articles published on this topic over the past 8 years , but the results of our search were enlightening . It turns out that between 1994 and 2002 , over 200 articles have been published that specifically address the use of digital technology in the teaching of science content . Although we have not critically reviewed the entire bibliography , the articles in this list represent all areas of scholarly work , including descriptions of technology use , theoretical and policy pieces , and qualitative and quantitative research . In addition , the reason that “many teacher educators are unfamiliar with the literature that has been published” became clearer to us in the process of this literature search . The following is a breakdown of the number of articles published in journals most familiar to science educators : Journal of Research in Science Teaching : 23 Science Education : 4 Journal of Science Teacher Education : 9 International Journal of Science Education : 5 School Science and Mathematics : 14 Almost 80 % of manuscripts related to technology in science education over the past 8 years have been published in journals that are not read regularly by most science teacher educators , such as the Journal of Science Education and Technology , the Journal of Computers in Mathematics and Science Teaching , and the Journal of Technology and Teacher Education . With this bibliography we hope to make the literature addressing technology in science education more accessible to the science education community . Although we have made every effort to make the bibliography complete , it should not be seen as exhaustive , and we welcome additions to it . As a matter of fact , our plan is to take advantage of the online medium of CITE Journal and make the list dynamic , updating it periodically . 428 The bibliography that follows lists publications in two categories : “K - 12 Science Education” and “Science Teacher Preparation . ” To make this bibliography more useful to educators , we are including a link to a rich text file ( . rtf ) of this bibliography , as well as a link to a rich text file of the bibliography categorized by nine selected topics : Bibliography Bibliography - categorized We hope that this bibliography will pique your curiosity about the use of technology in science education , and we encourage you to examine the literature . You may gain a broader perspective of its value in science teaching , as well as insight into new directions for research . References Bell , L . ( Ed . ) ( 2001 ) .
