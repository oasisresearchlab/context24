Introduction Research in Human - Computer Interaction ( HCI ) has been spectacularly successful , and has fundamentally changed computing . Just one example is the ubiquitous graphical interface used by Microsoft Windows 95 , which is based on the Macintosh , which is based on work at Xerox PARC , which in turn is based on early research at the Stanford Research Laboratory ( now SRI ) and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Another example is that virtually all software written today employs user interface toolkits and interface builders , concepts which were developed first at universities . Even the spectacular growth of the World - Wide Web is a direct result of HCI research : applying hypertext technology to browsers allows one to traverse a link across the world with a click of the mouse . Interface improvements more than anything else has triggered this explosive growth . Furthermore , the research that will lead to the user interfaces for the computers of tomorrow is happening at universities and a few corporate research labs . This paper tries to briefly summarize many of the important research developments in Human - Computer Interaction ( HCI ) technology . By " research , " I mean exploratory work at universities and government and corporate research labs ( such as Xerox PARC ) that is not directly related to products . By " HCI technology , " I am referring to the computer side of HCI . A companion article on the history of the " human side , " discussing the contributions from psychology , design , human factors and ergonomics would also be appropriate . A motivation for this article is to overcome the mistaken impression that much of the important work in Human - Computer Interaction occurred in industry , and if university research in Human - Computer Interaction is not supported , then industry will just carry on anyway . This is simply not true . This paper tries to show that many of the most famous HCI successes developed by companies are deeply rooted in university research . In fact , virtually all of today ' s major interface styles and applications have had significant influence from research at universities and labs , often with government funding . To illustrate this , this paper lists the funding sources of some of the major advances . Without this research , many of the advances in the field of HCI would probably not have taken place , and as a consequence , the user interfaces of commercial products would be far more difficult to use and learn than they are today . As described by Stu Card : " Government funding of advanced human - computer interaction technologies built the intellectual capital and trained the research teams for pioneer systems that , over a period of 25 years , revolutionized how people interact with computers . Industrial research laboratories at the corporate level in Xerox , IBM , AT & T , and others played a strong role in developing this technology and bringing it into a form suitable for the commercial arena . " [ 6 , p . 162 ] ) . Figure 1 shows time lines for some of the technologies discussed in this article . Of course , a deeper analysis would reveal much interaction between the university , corporate research and commercial activity streams . It is important to appreciate that years of research are involved in creating and making these technologies ready for widespread use . The same will be true for the HCI technologies that will provide the interfaces of tomorrow . It is clearly impossible to list every system and source in a paper of this scope , but I have tried to represent the earliest and most influential systems . Although there are a number of other surveys of HCI topics ( see , for example [ 1 ] [ 10 ] [ 33 ] [ 38 ] ) , none cover as many aspects as this one , or try to be as comprehensive in finding the original influences . Another useful resource is the video " All The Widgets , " which shows the historical progression of a number of user interface ideas [ 25 ] . The technologies covered in this paper include fundamental interaction styles like direct manipulation , the mouse pointing device , and windows ; several important kinds of application areas , such as drawing , text editing and spreadsheets ; the technologies that will likely have the biggest impact on interfaces of the future , such as gesture recognition , multimedia , and 3D ; and the technologies used to create interfaces using the other technologies , such as user interface management systems , toolkits , and interface builders . Figure 1 : Approximate time lines showing where work was performed on some major technologies discussed in this article . 2 . Basic Interactions • Direct Manipulation of graphical objects : The now ubiquitous direct manipulation interface , where visible objects on the screen are directly manipulated with a pointing device , was first demonstrated by Ivan Sutherland in Sketchpad [ 44 ] , which was his 1963 MIT PhD thesis . SketchPad supported the manipulation of objects using a light - pen , including grabbing objects , moving them , changing size , and using constraints . It contained the seeds of myriad important interface ideas . The system was built at Lincoln Labs with support from the Air Force and NSF . William Newman ' s Reaction Handler [ 30 ] , created at Imperial College , London ( 1966 - 67 ) provided direct manipulation of graphics , and introduced " Light Handles , " a form of graphical potentiometer , that was probably the first " widget . " Another early system was AMBIT / G ( implemented at MIT ' s Lincoln Labs , 1968 , ARPA funded ) . It employed , among other interface techniques , iconic representations , gesture recognition , dynamic menus with items selected using a pointing device , selection of icons by pointing , and moded and mode - free styles of interaction . David Canfield Smith coined the term " icons " in his 1975 Stanford PhD thesis on Pygmalion [ 41 ] ( funded by ARPA and NIMH ) and Smith later popularized icons as one of the chief designers of the Xerox Star [ 42 ] . Many of the interaction techniques popular in direct manipulation interfaces , such as how objects and text are selected , opened , and manipulated , were researched at Xerox PARC in the 1970 ' s . In particular , the idea of " WYSIWYG " ( what you see is what you get ) originated there with systems such as the Bravo text editor and the Draw drawing program [ 10 ] The concept of direct manipulation interfaces for everyone was envisioned by Alan Kay of Xerox PARC in a 1977 article about the " Dynabook " [ 16 ] . The first commercial systems to make extensive use of Direct Manipulation were the Xerox Star ( 1981 ) [ 42 ] , the Apple Lisa ( 1982 ) [ 51 ] and Macintosh ( 1984 ) [ 52 ] . Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland coined the term " Direct Manipulation " in 1982 and identified the components and gave psychological foundations [ 40 ] . • The Mouse : The mouse was developed at Stanford Research Laboratory ( now SRI ) in 1965 as part of the NLS project ( funding from ARPA , NASA , and Rome ADC ) [ 9 ] to be a cheap replacement for light - pens , which had been used at least since 1954 [ 10 , p . 68 ] . Many of the current uses of the mouse were demonstrated by Doug Engelbart as part of NLS in a movie created in 1968 [ 8 ] . The mouse was then made famous as a practical input device by Xerox PARC in the 1970 ' s . It first appeared commercially as part of the Xerox Star ( 1981 ) , the Three Rivers Computer Company ' s PERQ ( 1981 ) [ 23 ] , the Apple Lisa ( 1982 ) , and Apple Macintosh ( 1984 ) . • Windows : Multiple tiled windows were demonstrated in Engelbart ' s NLS in 1968 [ 8 ] . Early research at Stanford on systems like COPILOT ( 1974 ) [ 46 ] and at MIT with the EMACS text editor ( 1974 ) [ 43 ] also demonstrated tiled windows . Alan Kay proposed the idea of overlapping windows in his 1969 University of Utah PhD thesis [ 15 ] and they first appeared in 1974 in his Smalltalk system [ 11 ] at Xerox PARC , and soon after in the InterLisp system [ 47 ] . Some of the first commercial uses of windows were on Lisp Machines Inc . ( LMI ) and Symbolics Lisp Machines ( 1979 ) , which grew out of MIT AI Lab projects . The Cedar Window Manager from Xerox PARC was the first major tiled window manager ( 1981 ) [ 45 ] , followed soon by the Andrew window manager [ 32 ] by Carnegie Mellon University ' s Information Technology Center ( 1983 , funded by IBM ) . The main commercial systems popularizing windows were the Xerox Star ( 1981 ) , the Apple Lisa ( 1982 ) , and most importantly the Apple Macintosh ( 1984 ) . The early versions of the Star and Microsoft Windows were tiled , but eventually they supported overlapping windows like the Lisa and Macintosh . The X Window System , a current international standard , was developed at MIT in 1984 [ 39 ] . For a survey of window managers , see [ 24 ] . 3 . Application Types • Drawing programs : Much of the current technology was demonstrated in Sutherland ' s 1963 Sketchpad system . The use of a mouse for graphics was demonstrated in NLS ( 1965 ) . In 1968 Ken Pulfer and Grant Bechthold at the National Research Council of Canada built a mouse out of wood patterned after Engelbart ' s and used it with a key - frame animation system to draw all the frames of a movie . A subsequent movie , " Hunger " in 1971 won a number of awards , and was drawn using a tablet instead of the mouse ( funding by the National Film Board of Canada ) [ 3 ] . William Newman ' s Markup ( 1975 ) was the first drawing program for Xerox PARC ' s Alto , followed shortly by Patrick Baudelaire ' s Draw which added handling of lines and curves [ 10 , p . 326 ] . The first computer painting program was probably Dick Shoup ' s " Superpaint " at PARC ( 1974 - 75 ) . • Text Editing : In 1962 at the Stanford Research Lab , Engelbart proposed , and later implemented , a word processor with automatic word wrap , search and replace , user - definable macros , scrolling text , and commands to move , copy , and delete characters , words , or blocks of text . Stanford ' s TVEdit ( 1965 ) was one of the first CRT - based display editors that was widely used [ 48 ] . The Hypertext Editing System [ 50 , p . 108 ] from Brown University had screen editing and formatting of arbitrary - sized strings with a lightpen in 1967 ( funding from IBM ) . NLS demonstrated mouse - based editing in 1968 . TECO from MIT was an early screen - editor ( 1967 ) and EMACS [ 43 ] developed from it in 1974 . Xerox PARC ' s Bravo [ 10 , p . 284 ] was the first WYSIWYG editor - formatter ( 1974 ) . It was designed by Butler Lampson and Charles Simonyi who had started working on these concepts around 1970 while at Berkeley . The first commercial WYSIWYG editors were the Star , LisaWrite and then MacWrite . For a survey of text editors , see [ 22 ] [ 50 , p . 108 ] . • Spreadsheets : The initial spreadsheet was VisiCalc which was developed by Frankston and Bricklin ( 1977 - 8 ) for the Apple II while they were students at MIT and the Harvard Business School . The solver was based on a dependency - directed backtracking algorithm by Sussman and Stallman at the MIT AI Lab . • HyperText : The idea for hypertext ( where documents are linked to related documents ) is credited to Vannevar Bush ' s famous MEMEX idea from 1945 [ 4 ] . Ted Nelson coined the term " hypertext " in 1965 [ 29 ] . Engelbart ' s NLS system [ 8 ] at the Stanford Research Laboratories in 1965 made extensive use of linking ( funding from ARPA , NASA , and Rome ADC ) . The " NLS Journal " [ 10 , p . 212 ] was one of the first on - line journals , and it included full linking of articles ( 1970 ) . The Hypertext Editing System , jointly designed by Andy van Dam , Ted Nelson , and two students at Brown University ( funding from IBM ) was distributed extensively [ 49 ] . The University of Vermont ' s PROMIS ( 1976 ) was the first Hypertext system released to the user community . It was used to link patient and patient care information at the University of Vermont ' s medical center . The ZOG project ( 1977 ) from CMU was another early hypertext system , and was funded by ONR and DARPA [ 36 ] . Ben Shneiderman ' s Hyperties was the first system where highlighted items in the text could be clicked on to go to other pages ( 1983 , Univ . of Maryland ) [ 17 ] . HyperCard from Apple ( 1988 ) significantly helped to bring the idea to a wide audience . There have been many other hypertext systems through the years . Tim Berners - Lee used the hypertext idea to create the World Wide Web in 1990 at the government - funded European Particle Physics Laboratory ( CERN ) . Mosaic , the first popular hypertext browser for the World - Wide Web was developed at the Univ . of Illinois ' National Center for Supercomputer Applications ( NCSA ) . For a more complete history of HyperText , see [ 31 ] . • Computer Aided Design ( CAD ) : The same 1963 IFIPS conference at which Sketchpad was presented also contained a number of CAD systems , including Doug Ross ' s Computer - Aided Design Project at MIT in the Electronic Systems Lab [ 37 ] and Coons ' work at MIT with SketchPad [ 7 ] . Timothy Johnson ' s pioneering work on the interactive 3D CAD system Sketchpad 3 [ 13 ] was his 1963 MIT MS thesis ( funded by the Air Force ) . The first CAD / CAM system in industry was probably General Motor ' s DAC - 1 ( about 1963 ) . • Video Games : The first graphical video game was probably SpaceWar by Slug Russel of MIT in 1962 for the PDP - 1 [ 19 , p . 49 ] including the first computer joysticks . The early computer Adventure game was created by Will Crowther at BBN , and Don Woods developed this into a more sophisticated Adventure game at Stanford in 1966 [ 19 , p . 132 ] . Conway ' s game of LIFE was implemented on computers at MIT and Stanford in 1970 . The first popular commercial game was Pong ( about 1976 ) . 4 . Up - and - Coming Areas • Gesture Recognition : The first pen - based input device , the RAND tablet , was funded by ARPA . Sketchpad used light - pen gestures ( 1963 ) . Teitelman in 1964 developed the first trainable gesture recognizer . A very early demonstration of gesture recognition was Tom Ellis ' GRAIL system on the RAND tablet ( 1964 , ARPA funded ) . It was quite common in light - pen - based systems to include some gesture recognition , for example in the AMBIT / G system ( 1968 - - ARPA funded ) . A gesture - based text editor using proof - reading symbols was developed at CMU by Michael Coleman in 1969 . Bill Buxton at the University of Toronto has been studying gesture - based interactions since 1980 . Gesture recognition has been used in commercial CAD systems since the 1970s , and came to universal notice with the Apple Newton in 1992 . • Multi - Media : The FRESS project at Brown used multiple windows and integrated text and graphics ( 1968 , funding from industry ) . The Interactive Graphical Documents project at Brown was the first hypermedia ( as opposed to hypertext ) system , and used raster graphics and text , but not video ( 1979 - 1983 , funded by ONR and NSF ) . The Diamond project at BBN ( starting in 1982 , DARPA funded ) explored combining multimedia information ( text , spreadsheets , graphics , speech ) . The Movie Manual at the Architecture Machine Group ( MIT ) was one of the first to demonstrate mixed video and computer graphics in 1983 ( DARPA funded ) . • 3 - D : The first 3 - D system was probably Timothy Johnson ' s 3 - D CAD system mentioned above ( 1963 , funded by the Air Force ) . The " Lincoln Wand " by Larry Roberts was an ultrasonic 3D location sensing system , developed at Lincoln Labs ( 1966 , ARPA funded ) . That system also had the first interactive 3 - D hidden line elimination . An early use was for molecular modelling [ 18 ] . The late 60 ' s and early 70 ' s saw the flowering of 3D raster graphics research at the University of Utah with Dave Evans , Ivan Sutherland , Romney , Gouraud , Phong , and Watkins , much of it government funded . Also , the military - industrial flight simulation work of the 60 ' s - 70 ' s led the way to making 3 - D real - time with commercial systems from GE , Evans & Sutherland , Singer / Link ( funded by NASA , Navy , etc . ) . Another important center of current research in 3 - D is Fred Brooks ' lab at UNC ( e . g . [ 2 ] ) . • Virtual Reality and " Augmented Reality " : The original work on VR was performed by Ivan Sutherland when he was at Harvard ( 1965 - 1968 , funding by Air Force , CIA , and Bell Labs ) . Very important early work was by Tom Furness when he was at Wright - Patterson AFB . Myron Krueger ' s early work at the University of Connecticut was influential . Fred Brooks ' and Henry Fuch ' s groups at UNC did a lot of early research , including the study of force feedback ( 1971 , funding from US Atomic Energy Commission and NSF ) . Much of the early research on head - mounted displays and on the DataGlove was supported by NASA . • Computer Supported Cooperative Work . Doug Engelbart ' s 1968 demonstration of NLS [ 8 ] included the remote participation of multiple people at various sites ( funding from ARPA , NASA , and Rome ADC ) . Licklider and Taylor predicted on - line interactive communities in an 1968 article [ 20 ] and speculated about the problem of access being limited to the privileged . Electronic mail , still the most widespread multi - user software , was enabled by the ARPAnet , which became operational in 1969 , and by the Ethernet from Xerox PARC in 1973 . An early computer conferencing system was Turoff ' s EIES system at the New Jersey Institute of Technology ( 1975 ) . • Natural language and speech : The fundamental research for speech and natural language understanding and generation has been performed at CMU , MIT , SRI , BBN , IBM , AT & T Bell Labs and BellCore , much of it government funded . See , for example , [ 34 ] for a survey of the early work . 5 . Software Tools and Architectures The area of user interface software tools is quite active now , and many companies are selling tools . Most of today ' s applications are implemented using various forms of software tools . For a more complete survey and discussion of UI tools , see [ 26 ] . • UIMSs and Toolkits : ( There are software libraries and tools that support creating interfaces by writing code . ) The first User Interface Management System ( UIMS ) was William Newman ' s Reaction Handler [ 30 ] created at Imperial College , London ( 1966 - 67 with SRC funding ) . Most of the early work was done at universities ( Univ . of Toronto with Canadian government funding , George Washington Univ . with NASA , NSF , DOE , and NBS funding , Brigham Young University with industrial funding , etc . ) . The term " UIMS " was coined by David Kasik at Boeing ( 1982 ) [ 14 ] . Early window managers such as Smalltalk ( 1974 ) and InterLisp , both from Xerox PARC , came with a few widgets , such as popup menus and scrollbars . The Xerox Star ( 1981 ) was the first commercial system to have a large collection of widgets . The Apple Macintosh ( 1984 ) was the first to actively promote its toolkit for use by other developers to enforce a consistent interface . An early C + + toolkit was InterViews [ 21 ] , developed at Stanford ( 1988 , industrial funding ) . Much of the modern research is being performed at universities , for example the Garnet ( 1988 ) [ 28 ] and Amulet ( 1994 ) [ 27 ] projects at CMU ( ARPA funded ) , and subArctic at Georgia Tech ( 1996 , funding by Intel and NSF ) . • Interface Builders : ( These are interactive tools that allow interfaces composed of widgets such as buttons , menus and scrollbars to be placed using a mouse . ) The Steamer project at BBN ( 1979 - 85 ; ONR funding ) demonstrated many of the ideas later incorporated into interface builders and was probably the first object - oriented graphics system . Trillium [ 12 ] was developed at Xerox PARC in 1981 . Another early interface builder was the MenuLay system [ 5 ] developed by Bill Buxton at the University of Toronto ( 1983 , funded by the Canadian Government ) . The Macintosh ( 1984 ) included a " Resource Editor " which allowed widgets to be placed and edited . Jean - Marie Hullot created " SOS Interface " in Lisp for the Macintosh while working at INRIA ( 1984 , funded by the French government ) which was the first modern " interface builder . " Hullot built this into a commercial product in 1986 and then went to work for NeXT and created the NeXT Interface Builder ( 1988 ) , which popularized this type of tool . Now there are literally hundreds of commercial interface builders . • Component Architectures : The idea of creating interfaces by connecting separately written components was first demonstrated in the Andrew project [ 32 ] by Carnegie Mellon University ' s Information Technology Center ( 1983 , funded by IBM ) . It is now being widely popularized by Microsoft ' s OLE and Apple ' s OpenDoc architectures . 6 . Discussion It is clear that all of the most important innovations in Human - Computer Interaction have benefited from research at both corporate research labs and universities , much of it funded by the government . The conventional style of graphical user interfaces that use windows , icons , menus and a mouse and are in a phase of standardization , where almost everyone is using the same , standard technology and just making minute , incremental changes . Therefore , it is important that university , corporate , and government - supported research continue , so that we can develop the science and technology needed for the user interfaces of the future . Another important argument in favor of HCI research in universities is that computer science students need to know about user interface issues . User interfaces are likely to be one of the main value - added competitive advantages of the future , as both hardware and basic software become commodities . If students do not know about user interfaces , they will not serve industry needs . It seems that only through computer science does HCI research disseminate out into products . Furthermore , without appropriate levels of funding of academic HCI research , there will be fewer PhD graduates in HCI to perform research in corporate labs , and fewer top - notch graduates in this area will be interested in being professors , so the needed user interface courses will not be offered . As computers get faster , more of the processing power is being devoted to the user interface . The interfaces of the future will use gesture recognition , speech recognition and generation , " intelligent agents , " adaptive interfaces , video , and many other technologies now being investigated by research groups at universities and corporate labs [ 35 ] . It is imperative that this research continue and be well - supported .
