Striz & Pamela L . Tuma The plasma membrane of polarized hepatocytes is functionally divided into two domains : the apical and basolateral . Our focus is to define the molecular basis of polarized protein sorting of newly - synthesized membrane and secretory proteins in WIF - B cells , an excellent model system for polarized hepatocytes . We determined that MAL2 ( myelin and lymphocyte protein 2 ) and its binding partner , serine / threonine kinase 16 ( STK16 ) regulate basolateral constitutive secretion . Because STK16 is a constitutively active kinase , we reasoned that constitutively phosphorylated substrates must participate in constitutive secretion . To identify either STK16 substrates or other proteins that regulate constitutive secretion , we took a proteomics approach . Post - nuclear supernatants from cells expressing wild type or a kinase - dead ( E202A ) STK16 were separated on 2D gels and immunoblotted with antibodies against phospho - serine / threonine residues . Sixteen spots were identified from E202A - expressing cells that reproducibly displayed decreased immunoreactivity . From these spots , 28 proteins were identified as possible STK16 substrates . Out of these 28 possible substrates , 25 % of them encode predicted STK16 phosphorylation consensus sites , with WD repeat containing protein - 1 ( WDR1 ) encoding two such sites . Based on this finding and on the finding that actin remodeling is required for hepatic secretion , we further confirmed that WDR1 is a phosphoprotein that regulates secretion . The hepatocyte surface is functionally divided into two domains : the basolateral and apical . The basolateral sur - face faces the blood whereas the apical surface faces the bile , the complex molecular soap needed for dietary fat absorption and waste removal . This functional “polarity” is mirrored by the asymmetrical distribution of proteins and lipids required for proper liver function . Our research addresses the fundamental question of how such hepatic polarity is established and maintained . Our focus has been to define the molecular mechanisms and iden - tify the molecules that regulate polarized protein sorting of newly - synthesized membrane and secretory proteins in polarized hepatic WIF - B cells . WIF - B cells are an excellent hepatic model system for the study of liver in health and in disease . They enter a terminal differentiation program , and after 7 – 10 days in culture , ~ 90 % of cells are fully differentiated and exhibit polarized surface domains that are functionally and compositionally analogous to the apical and basolateral sur - faces 1 . Importantly for these studies , polarized protein sorting / trafficking pathways are conserved as they are in hepatocytes in situ . We have characterized WIF - B endocytic and biosynthetic pathways and mapped out the itineraries of recycling receptors , apical and basolateral residents 2 – 6 and have developed many useful assays for monitoring protein trafficking 7 . With such assays in hand , the WIF - B cells have been used as surrogates for nor - mal hepatocytes by us and others in studies of protein trafficking and activity , bile acid and organic ion secretion , phospholipid translocation and HDL biosynthesis 8 – 19 . Also importantly , liver specific activities are maintained in culture as they are in situ such that WIF - B cells have also been used to examine many types of liver injury including drug - , heavy metal - , hypoxia - and alcohol - induced injury , steatosis , sitosterolemia , hemochromatosis , atherosclerosis , familial intrahepatic cholestasis , hypercholesterolemia and Wilson’s Disease 20 – 30 . Over a decade ago , we initiated studies to examine the role of MAL2 ( myelin and lymphocyte protein 2 ) in regulating hepatic polarized protein sorting . We first confirmed that MAL2 functioned in transcytosis in WIF - B Department of Biology , The Catholic University of America , Washington DC , 20064 , USA . Alfonso López - Coral and Anneliese C .

( email : tuma @ cua . edu ) Received : 15 March 2018 Accepted : 14 August 2018 Published : xx xx xxxx OPEN www . nature . com / scientificreports / 2 Scientific RepoRts | ( 2018 ) 8 : 13049 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 31426 - 1 cells 31 . Like in HepG2 cells 32 , we determined that transport from the early endosome to the sub - apical com - partment ( SAC ) of three classes of newly - synthesized apical residents was impaired : polymeric IgA - receptor ( pIgA - R ) , single spanning and GPI - anchored residents 31 . In the course of those studies , we further determined that MAL2 selectively regulates delivery of newly - synthesized pIgA - R ( but not other single spanning apical pro - teins ) from the TGN to the basolateral membrane . And most recently , we determined that MAL2 also regu - lates constitutive secretion of soluble cargo along with its binding partner , serine / threonine kinase 16 ( STK16 ) 33 . Because little is known about the molecular machinery that regulates constitutive secretion , we have continued our analysis of STK16 . STK16 belongs to the unique , small family of numb - associated kinases . These divergent kinases share less than 25 % identity with their nearest neighbor and are not well characterized . STK16 is a particularly interesting and enigmatic member of this family . Out of its 305 amino acids , only 29 are outside the catalytic site , the first 19 and the last 10 amino acids 34 . STK16 encodes no regulatory domains and is constitutively active 34 . Based on our previous results of the overexpression of a dominant negative , kinase - dead version of the enzyme , we determined that kinase activity is required for STK16 function in secretion 33 . This further implies that constitutively phospho - rylated substrates must also participate in constitutive secretion . To identify additional molecular players that either participate in secretion directly or are part of a kinase / phosphatase network that regulates secretion , we took a proteomics approach . Post - nuclear supernatants from polarized hepatic WIF - B cells expressing wild type or the kinase - dead STK16 ( E202A ) were separated on 2D gels and immunoblotted with antibodies against phospho - serine / threonine residues . In all , 98 proteins were identified . After removing duplicate hits , 68 proteins were further considered . Based on the finding that actin remodeling is required for hepatic secretion 35 , we further examined WD repeat - containing protein 1 ( WDR1 ) 1 as a potential component of the molecular machinery that drives constitutive secretion or as a part of a STK16 - mediated phosphoprotein network that regulates secretion . Results A phospho - proteomic screen identifies possible STK16 substrates and / or regulators of consti - tutive secretion . To identify STK16 substrates and implicate additional molecular players that function in secretion , we took a proteomics approach . Because our strategy relied on detecting decreased protein phospho - rylation levels in E202A expressing cells , we specifically chose a 2D gel immunoblotting / LC - MS / MS approach . Although admittedly less sensitive and precise than mass spectrometry alone , it allowed us to easily visualize decreased detection levels in order to select proteins for further analysis . As a proof of principle experiment for our approach , cells expressing wild type or the kinase - dead ( E202A ) STK16 were washed and lysed in buffers con - taining sodium vanadate and phosphatase inhibitors and 20 μ g of total protein from each sample were immun - blotted with antibodies specific for phospho - serine and - threonine residues . Cells were also pre - treated for 4 h in the absence or presence of the proteasome inhibitor , lactacystin , a treatment we have shown enhances E202A expression 33 . As shown in Fig . 1A , both forms of the ~ 35 kDa kinase were robustly expressed in WIF - B cells with enhanced detection of E202A in cells treated with lactacystin . Tubulin levels served as the loading control . In Fig . 1B , decreased immunoreactivity of a number of discrete bands ( marked with arrows ) was observed in E202A expressing cells on immunoblots performed in parallel . Further decreases were seen in E202A expressing cells treated with lactacystin . To quantitate the decreased immunoreactivity of selected bands in E202A expressing cells , we prepared whole cell lysates prepared in the absence of lactacystin to avoid confounding results due to proteosome inhibition . As shown in Fig . 1C , reproducible decreases from ~ 2 . 0 to 3 . 5 - fold were observed for all selected species , varying from high to low molecular weight , confirming the feasibility of our approach . Because nuclear proteins are not likely STK16 substrates involved in secretion , we further analysed 20 μ g of total protein from post - nuclear supernatants prepared from cells expressing wild type or E202A STK16 for differential phosphorylation . As for Fig . 1C , we chose not to include lactacystin . As shown in Fig . 2A , robust and equivalent levels of both the wild type and E202A STK16 were detected in these samples . Additionally , decreased detection of a number of discrete bands ( marked with arrows ) and clusters of bands ( marked with brackets ) was observed in E202A expressing cells ( Fig . 2B ) . To identify possible STK16 substrates and other members of the phospho - network in an as unbiased way as possible , we further analyzed the post - nuclear supernatants by 2D PAGE followed by LC - MS / MS . 550 μ g of protein from wild type or E202A expressing cell lysates were resolved on 2D gels in duplicate and immunob - lotted with the anti - phospho - serine / threonine antibodies . Coomassie Blue - stained gels revealed that the gels were equally loaded and displayed similar staining patterns ( Fig . 2C , CBB ; only one of the technical duplicates is shown ) . Although the overall number of spots did not significantly differ on the immunoblots , closer examination revealed differential patterns of immunoreactivity on blots from E202A expressing cells ( Fig . 2C , IB ) . Arrowheads mark three examples of proteins with decreased immunoreactivity on immunoblots from E202A expressing cells . To identify spots with altered immunoreactivity , images of blots with lysates from wild type STK16 expressing cells were merged with the blots with samples from E202A expressing cells ( Fig . 3A , only one merged image is shown ) . From the merged images , only the discrete spots ( in white ) were selected for analysis while the many smeared regions were excluded . To determine the fold - change in phosphorylation , the density of individual spots on the gels and immunoblots was determined . The level of each of the immunoreactive spots was normalized to the relative protein level of its corresponding spot in the Coomassie blue - stained gel . The fold - change in phos - phorylation was calculated by comparing wild type ratios to those from E202A expressing cells . In all , 282 spots were analyzed of which 34 displayed significantly different levels of immunoreactivity in both replicates ( Table 1 ) . The spots with decreased phosphorylation ( on the left ) represent potential STK16 substrates whereas the spots with enhanced phosphorylation ( on the right ) likely represent other members of a phosphoprotein network that reciprocally regulate constitutive secretion ( Fig . 3B ) . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 Scientific RepoRts | ( 2018 ) 8 : 13049 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 31426 - 1 Figure 1 . E202A expression leads to decreased serine / threonine phosphorylation in total cell lysates . ( A ) Total cell lysates were prepared from WIF - B cells expressing wild type ( WT ) or the kinase dead STK16 ( E202A ) after treatment in the absence or presence of 5 μ M lactacystin ( lac ) for 4 h at 37 °C . Lysates ( 20 μ g total protein per lane ) were immunoblotted for STK16 ( with anti - V5 antibodies ) ( top panel ) or α - tubulin ( as a loading control ) .

( C ) The fold - decrease in immunoreactivity of the proteins marked with arrows in B ( from samples without lactacystin ) was determined using densitometry . Values represent the average from three independent experiments ± SEM . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 4 Scientific RepoRts | ( 2018 ) 8 : 13049 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 31426 - 1 To confirm the densitometry results , we visually examined enlarged regions of the immunoblot pairs from the duplicate immunoblots . Examples of these regions that showed reproducibly decreased or increased immu - noreactivity are shown ( Fig . 3C ) . Of the 34 spots examined , 30 spots ( 16 with decreased and 14 with increased ) from both sets of immunoblots displayed equivalent changes in immunoreactivity and were selected for LC - MS / MS identification . In the end , 98 proteins were positively identified . Table S1 provides a complete list of the proteins with their isoelectric points , molecular weights , accession numbers and Mascot scores . The upper half of Table S1 includes those proteins with decreased immunoreactivity ( possible STK16 substrates ) while the bottom lists those proteins with enhanced immunoreactivity ( possible reciprocal regulators ) . After discarding adenovirus - associated proteins and duplicate hits , we identified 28 proteins with decreased immunoreactivity and 40 proteins with enhanced immunoreactivity . To better select possible regulators of constitutive secretion , we grouped the 68 proteins by subcellular location and general function . Table S2 lists those proteins with decreased phosphorylation while Table S3 lists those with increased phosphorylation . Although the LC - MS / MS approach used in these studies could not detect individual phosphorylated residues , the majority of these proteins ( as indicated ) have been previously identified as serine / threonine phosphorylated proteins either directly or by phospho - proteomic analysis validating our screen . The majority of the proteins identified are cytoplasmically - oriented thereby accessible to STK16 kinase activity fur - ther validating the results of the screen . Our bias during this initial screen was to select proteins whose known functions implicate them as possible regulators of vesicle budding / docking and / or fusion and those that encode a potential STK16 phosphorylation consensus sequence .

From peptide library screens , it was determined that STK16 has a strong preference for threonine over serine as a phospho - acceptor , and an optimal threonine phosphorylation sequence of X - X - P / I / V - φ - H / Y - T - N / G - X - X - X was identified 34 . We searched the sequences of the proteins with decreased immunoreactivity for this motif and found that 7 of the 28 proteins ( 25 % ) encoded such a sequence , and that WDR1 encoded two ( Fig . 4A ) . For comparison , we have listed the threonine 100 phosphorylation site of develop - mentally regulated GTP - binding protein 1 ( DRG1 ) , a known STK16 binding partner and substrate that was used in the derivation of the consensus sequence along with the peptide library screens 34 . Because actin remodeling is required for hepatic secretion 35 , we chose WDR1 , an actin - associated protein known to enhance cofilin actin disassembly activity ( see Discussion ) , for further analysis . Importantly , endogenous WDR1 total protein levels were comparable in cells expressing wild type or E202A STK16 ( Fig . 4B ) . When quantitated and normalized to total tubulin levels , WDR1 levels in E202A expressing cells were ~ 95 % of control ( Fig . 4C ) . To determine if WDR1 is phosphorylated , we first purified phosphoproteins from WIF - B cells pre - treated with okadaic acid ( a robust , pan - phosphatase inhibitor ) using metal affinity chromatography optimized for phospo - protein retention ( see Materials and Methods ) . Equal amounts of lysates ( ~ 1 mg total protein ) from cells treated in the absence or presence of 100 nM okadaic acid were applied to columns and the flow through col - lected . After two washes , the columns were eluted in 4 ml of elution buffer collected in four fractions of 1 ml each . As shown in Fig . 4D , WDR1 was detected in the first three eluate fractions indicating that at steady state , and as predicted , WDR1 is a phosphoprotein . In eluates from okadaic acid - treated cells , increased levels of WDR1 were detected , peaking in the first two and detected in all four fractions , indicating enhanced associations with the column matrix and hence , increased WDR1 phosphorylation ( Fig . 4D ) . When quantitated , we determined that WDR1 phosphorylation was enhanced in okadaic acid - treated cells by almost 3 - fold ( Fig . 4D ) . To provide further evidence that WDR1 is a phosphoprotein and / or an STK16 substrate , we purified phos - phoproteins from cells expressing either wild type or E202A STK16 . As shown in Fig . 4E , lysates from cells expressing wild type STK16 showed similar elution profiles as control ( uninfected ) cells , peaking in the first two fractions with limited detection in the third . In contrast , WDR1 detection was significantly decreased in the first two eluate fractions from lysates expressing E202A indicating decreased phosphorylation ( Fig . 4E ) . When quan - titated , WDR1 phosphorylation levels in cells expressing wild type STK16 were ~ 2 - fold greater than in E202A expressing cells ( Fig . 4E ) . These results are consistent with the 2 . 8 - fold decrease in phosphorylation observed on the 2D immunoblots ( Table 1 , spot 101 ) . Although the values are not statistically significant , they are remarkably consistent given the many steps involved in the column purification and the numerous fractions collected and analyzed ( see Materials and Methods ) . In fact , when examining individual experiments , the trend in the values was extremely reproducible . In all cases , less phospho - WDR1 was retained on the columns from cells expressing E202A when compared to those from wild type expressing cells ( values ranged from as low as 10 % of wild type values to 70 % ) which likely reflects differences in E202A infection efficiencies across experiments ( see ref . 33 ) . These results indicate that WDR1 is a phosphoprotein . We next examined endogenous WDR1 steady state distributions in polarized WIF - B cells . As described for other polarized epithelial cells , WDR1 labeling was detected at or near the apical surface and in the cyto - plasm in polarized WIF - B cells 36 – 38 ( Fig . 5A , a ) . We also detected WDR1 at the basolateral surface ( marked with arrowheads ) consistent with a role in basolateral secretion .

( D ) Lysates ( ~ 1 mg total protein ) from cells treated with okadaic acid ( OA ) or ( E ) from cells expressing WT or E202A STK16 were applied to metal affinity columns www . nature . com / scientificreports / 8 Scientific RepoRts | ( 2018 ) 8 : 13049 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 31426 - 1 membrane - associated patches in cells at the edge of the monolayer ( Fig . 5A , c ; the images were intentionally over - exposed to better visualize the surface labeling ) . If WDR1 serves as a constitutively phosphorylated protein in constitutive secretion , a simple prediction is that okadaic acid treatment should lead to altered WDR1 actin asso - ciation at the plasma membrane . Consistent with this prediction , increased WDR1 labeling was detected at both the apical and basolateral membranes in cells treated with okadaic acid ( Fig . 5A , b ) . In WIF - B cells at the edge of the monolayer , enhanced WDR1 membrane - association was also observed in okadaic acid - treated cells with respect to both staining intensity and numbers of surface - associated puncta ( Fig . 5A , d , marked with arrowheads ) . We also examined WDR1 distributions in the non - polarized , hepatoma - derived Clone 9 cells for ease of visualization and manipulation . As observed for other cell types and in WIF - B cells at the edge of the mon - olayer , endogenous WDR1 distributed to intracellular structures , the cytoplasm and at discrete patches at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 5B , a ) . Also as observed for WIF - B cells at the edge of the monolayer , okadaic acid treat - ment led to enhanced WDR1 membrane association . Arrowheads are marking enlarged and more numerous WDR1 - positive surface patches after 30 or 60 min of treatment ( Fig . 5B , b , c ) . Importantly , total WDR1 protein levels did not change in okadaic acid - treated cells ( Fig . 5C ) . If WDR1 serves as a constitutively phosphorylated protein in response to STK16 activity , another simple pre - diction is that expression of wild type STK16 should lead to enhanced WDR1 surface labeling while expression of the dominant negative , kinase - dead E202A STK16 should decrease it . As we and others have shown previously , wild type STK16 distributed mainly to the Golgi whereas the kinase - dead E202A distributed to intracellular puncta ( that have not yet been identified ) [ 3 ] ( Fig . 5D , a , c , respectively ) . As predicted , enhanced numbers of WDR1 - positive surface patches were observed in the STK16 expressing cells to a similar extent as observed for okadaic acid - treated cells ( compare Fig . 5D , b with Fig . 5B , c ) . In contrast , WDR1 surface labeling was nearly completely abolished in E202A - expressing cells ( Fig . 5D , d ) . When cells were scored for WDR1 surface labeling , a striking loss of membrane staining was observed with only 11 . 9 ± 1 . 9 % ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) of E202A - expressing cells positive for WDR1 surface patches ( Fig . 5E ) further implicating WDR1 as a phospho - protein . Constitutive basolateral secretion is regulated by WDR1 and actin dynamics . To confirm WDR1 as a regulator of actin remodeling at sites of vesicle docking and fusion in hepatic cells , we next examined its distributions in cells treated with the actin depolymerizing agent , latrunculin B . As described above , WDR1 labeling was detected at or near the apical and basolateral surfaces and in the cytoplasm of polarized WIF - B cells ( Fig . 6A , a ) . In contrast , WDR1 labeling at the membrane domains was lost in latrunculin B - ( Fig . 6A , b and Fig . S1A , b ) or cytochalasin D - treated cells ( Fig . S1B , d ) with a reciprocal increase in cytoplasmic labeling confirming that WDR1 distributions are actin - dependent in WIF - B cells . Similarly , the WDR1 - positive mem - brane patches were lost in latrunculin B - ( Fig . 6A , d , Fig . S1A , d or cytochalasin - treated cells present at the edge of the monolayer ( Fig . S1B , e ) . A similar loss of the discrete WDR1 surface labeling was lost in latrunculin B - ( Fig . 6B , b ) or cytochalasin D - treated ( Fig . S1B , f ) Clone 9 cells with a reciprocal increase in cytoplasmic stain - ing . When cells were scored for WDR1 surface labeling , nearly 100 % ( 96 . 6 ± 0 . 3 % ) of control cells displayed WDR1 - positive surface patches that were virtually all lost ( 2 . 9 ± 1 . 4 % , p ≤ 0 . 001 ) in latrunculin B - treated cells ( Fig . 6C ) . Importantly , surface labeling of WDR1 reappeared after latrunculin - B washout in both polarized and nonpolarized cells ( Fig . S1A , c , f ) . To confirm that basolateral secretion requires actin remodeling in WIF - B cells as seen for other polarized epi - thelial cells ( see Discussion ) , we monitored albumin release in cells pretreated with latrunculin B for short times ( to minimally disrupt the cortical actin network ) vs . longer times ( to more fully depolymerize the network ) . As observed for other epithelial cell types , shorter pretreatment reproducibly enhanced albumin secretion to almost twice that as observed in control ( p ≤ 0 . 029 ) , whereas the longer pretreatment reproducibly impaired release by ~ 40 % ( p ≤ 0 . 015 ) ( Fig . 6D , E ) . The somewhat modest impairment after the longer preincubation likely reflects incomplete actin disassembly . Finally , we examined a role for WDR1 in secretion by monitoring the release of a soluble form of dipeptidyl peptidase IV ( sDPPIV ) , a well - characterized , constitutively secreted protein 39 , in cells knocked down for WDR1 expression . As shown in Fig . 7A , B , WDR1 expression was considerably knocked down morphologically and biochemically , respectively , after transfection with a pool of three WDR1 - specific siRNA duplexes for 48 h . No change in WDR1 expression was observed in non - transfected cells or in cells transfected with scrambled duplexes ( Fig . 7A , B ) . When quantitated , almost 90 % knock down was observed in cells transfected with WDR1 siRNA ( Fig . 7C ) . Similar levels of sDPPIV were expressed in control and WDR1 cells transfected with scrambled siRNA duplexes . However , a slight , but reproducible , increase in sDPPIV levels was observed in WDR1 knockdown cells ( Fig . 7B ) . Tubulin served as the loading control . When secretion was monitored in the same sets of cells as shown in Fig . 7B , we found that similar levels of sDPPIV were secreted after 60 min in both control cells and those transfected with scrambled siRNA . In contrast , much higher levels were detected in the media from cells knocked down for WDR1 expression ( Fig . 7D ) . To take into account the increased sDPPIV expression in WDR1 knock down cells , we calculated the rates of secre - tion as the percent sDPPIV secreted of the total expressed per minute .

Importantly , there was no significant difference observed in rates between control cells and those treated with scrambled siRNA .

In all , we identified 28 proteins that displayed decreased immunoreactivity in cells expressing the kinase - dead version of STK16 ( E202A ) that represent possible substrates . We also identified 40 proteins with enhanced phosphorylation . Although they are not likely STK16 substrates , they may be important play - ers in a cellular kinase / phosphatase network that reciprocally regulates constitutive secretion . The majority of the proteins identified were cytoplasmically - oriented thereby accessible to STK16 kinase activity validating the results of the screen . Although the LC - MS / MS used was not optimized to detect phosphorylation , the majority of the proteins have been identified as phosphorylated on serine and / or threonine residues either from individ - ual studies or from large phospho - proteomics screens . Sequence gazing also revealed that 25 % of the possible substrates encoded a preferred threonine STK16 phosphorylation consensus sequence 34 , further validating our screen . Based on the finding that the actin - associated WDR1 encodes two such consensus sequences and that actin remodeling is required for hepatic secretion 35 , we further confirmed that WDR1 is a phospho - protein that regulates secretion . WDR1 is a phosphoprotein . Our results indicate that WDR1 is a phosphorylated protein that regulates constitutive secretion . Although we have not directly tested whether WDR1 is an STK16 substrate , it is a likely candidate . Not only does WDR1 encode two threonine - based STK16 consensus sequences , its phosphorylation state reciprocally correlates with wild type or E202A STK16 expression . Similarly , enhanced WDR1 surface asso - ciation is observed in cells expressing wild type STK16 or treated with okadaic acid whereas surface distributions are lost in cells expressing E202A . Even if WDR1 is not found to be a direct STK16 substrate , it is at minimum , a part of a kinase / phosphatase network that regulates constitutive secretion . Proteomics screens have identified WDR1 as a tyrosine - phosphorylated protein and recent studies have demonstrated that it is a specific substrate for eyes absent 3 ( EYA3 ) phosphatase at tyrosine 238 40 . In cells expressing Y238F mutants , only a 30 % reduc - tion in WDR1 phosphorylation was observed indicating other WDR1 phosphorylation sites must be present . Interestingly , EYA3 also exhibits threonine phosphatase activity possibly implying that these other sites may include the threonine - based STK16 consensus sites . We are currently examining this compelling possibility . WDR1 regulates secretion . WDR1 ( also known as actin - interacting protein 1 ; AIP1 ) was first identified as an actin binding protein from yeast two hybrid analysis 41 , 42 . This protein encodes conserved WD40 repeats within β - propellers that serve as binding sites for actin and cofilin 43 . Recent studies in nonpolarized cells have shown that upon binding , WDR1 greatly enhances cofilin’s severing activity of both actin filaments and branched polymers leading to rapid actin disassembly 44 . Such activity has placed WDR1 as an important regulator of many cell processes in nonpolarized cells including cell migration via enhanced lamellipodial dynamics , cytokinesis and chemotaxis 45 . In polarized cells , WDR1 has also been associated with a number of complex cellular processes . In intestinal cells , WDR1 is enriched at apical junctions , and when knocked down , tight junction assembly is impaired and the juxta - junctional actin cytoskeleton is disorganized and displays altered dynamics 37 . Similarly , in the developing Drosophila eye epithelium , WDR1 and cofilin are required for adherens junction remodeling 36 . More recently , WDR1 depletion in developing mouse epidermis was found to compromise planar cell polarity , and when knocked down with cofilin , a loss of cell adhesion , surface and planar cell polarity was observed 38 . Our results now place WDR1 / cofilin - mediated - actin remodeling as an important regulatory feature of constitutive secretion . Although WDR1 function in secretion was not examined in the systems described above , it may con - tribute to the complex phenotypes observed . For example , does WDR1 knockdown lead to altered membrane delivery ( either to the apical or basolateral domain ) of key components required for tight or adherens junction assembly ? Hints for how local actin modeling is required for secretory vesicle docking and fusion come from studies using actin disrupting agents . As for most other polarized epithelial cells , the polarized hepatocyte lacks actin stress fibers . Rather , a dense cortical actin web lines both the apical and basolateral surfaces that secretory ves - icles must traverse to dock and fuse with the membrane . Early studies in chromaffin cells and neutrophils that demonstrated that local and transient actin disassembly were required for exocytosis are consistent with this actin barrier function in exocytosis 46 , 47 . However , more thorough studies using wider concentration ranges of actin depolymerizing agents revealed that actin remodeling at the sites of vesicle docking and fusion is actually a two - step process 48 , 49 . Low concentrations of actin disrupting agents enhanced exocytosis ( consistent with the barrier function ) , but treatment with higher concentrations ( that support complete actin disassembly ) led to impaired exocytosis 48 , 49 . Thus , local disassembly is likely required for vesicle access to the membrane , but some minimal actin cytoskeletal structure is required for vesicle fusion 48 , 49 . This conclusion is consistent with our find - ings that WDR1 ( that promotes actin disassembly ) and members of the rho family of GTPases and their effectors ( that promote actin assembly ) are required for vesicle docking and fusion ( reviewed in 48 , 50 ) . At present , we have few mechanistic details of how WDR1 functions in secretion . Our findings that WDR1 knockdown led to enhanced secretion implies that WDR1 / cofilin - mediated actin disassembly is regulating the actin barrier function in exocytosis . Because okadaic acid treatment and STK16 overexpression led to enhanced plasma membrane association of WDR1 whereas E202A expression led to diminished detection at the surface , further suggests that phosphorylation is required for WDR1 function in secretion . However this is in direct contrast to observations from HeLa cells knocked down for STK16 expression or expressing kinase dead STK16 where F - actin levels were decreased 51 . Because both increased actin disassembly via enhanced WDR1 / cofilin severing activity and decreased WDR1 phosphorylation are predicted in this context , the implication is that phosphorylation impairs WDR1 activity . These disparate results point to the complexity in the fine tuning of actin remodelling required for proper cell function within and among cell types . Because WDR1 mutations have been www . nature . com / scientificreports / 13 Scientific RepoRts | ( 2018 ) 8 : 13049 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 31426 - 1 linked to a number of human blood disorders and the progression of many different cancer types 45 , understand - ing the mechanisms regulating local actin remodelling have potential therapeutic ramifications .

Clone 9 cells were cultured for 1 – 2 days and WIF - B cells for 8 – 12 days until they reached maximal density and polarity . Virus Production and Infection . Recombinant adenoviruses encoding C - terminally , V5 epitope - tagged full - length and kinase - dead STK16 ( E202A ) were generated using the ViraPower Adenoviral Expression System ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad CA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as we have described 33 . The full - length and kinase - dead STK16 constructs have been described and characterized 33 , 53 . The virus encoding the V5 - tagged sDPPIV has been described previously 39 . WIF - B cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus particles for 60 min at 37 °C as described 39 . Complete medium was added to the cells and they were incubated an additional 16 – 24 h to allow for protein expression . Sample Preparation . WIF - B cells expressing wild type or E202A were washed in TBS containing 1 mM sodium vanadate ( Sigma Aldrich ) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail ( Set 1 , EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA ) diluted according to the manufacturer . The cells were lysed in 1 % TX - 100 in Hepes buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 25 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 ) containing protease inhibitors ( 2 µ g / ml each of leupeptin , antipain , PMSF and benzamidine ) and the vanadate / phosphatase inhibitor cocktail and incubated on ice for 30 min . The lysates were either mixed with Laemmli sample buffer directly 54 or centrifuged for 20 min at 1 , 000 × g at 4 °C to prepare post - nuclear superna - tants . Protein concentrations of the whole cell or cleared lysates were determined using Bio - Rad protein assay ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . 20 μ g of protein was loaded into each lane on 1D gels . Immediately before 2D SDS - PAGE analysis , the samples were diluted with a 1 : 1 mixture of SDS PAGE : urea sample buffers . 550 μ g of protein were loaded per 2D gel . Immunoblotting for 1D Gels . Proteins were electrophoretically separated using SDS - PAGE and trans - ferred to nitrocellulose . After blocking for 1 h with Blotto ( TBS containing 5 % milk ( w / v ) and 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) for 1 h at RT , the blots were incubated overnight with the antibodies against both phospho - serine and - threonine ( both 1 : 4000 ) in TBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 at 4 °C . When immunoblotting for STK16 or sDPPIV ( with anti - V5 antibodies ) , WDR1 , albumin or for α - tubulin , PBS was used instead of TBS . HRP - conjugated second - ary antibodies were used at 5 ng / ml and immunoreactivity detected by enhanced chemiluminescence ( Thermo Scientific , Waltham , MA ) and a ChemiDoc Touch Imager System ( Bio - Rad ) . 2D Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting . 2D electrophoresis was performed by Kendrick Labs , Inc . ( Madison , WI ) using the carrier ampholine method of isoelectric focusing 55 , 56 . Isoelectric focusing was per - formed in a 3 . 3 mm inner diameter glass tube using 2 % pH 3 – 10 Isodalt Servalytes ( Serva , Heidelberg , Germany ) for 20 , 000 volt - hrs . The tube gel pH gradient plot was determined with a surface pH electrode . After equilibration for 10 min in buffer “0” ( 10 % glycerol , 50 mM DTT , 2 . 3 % SDS and 0 . 0625 M Tris , pH 6 . 8 ) , each tube gel was sealed to the top of a stacking gel overlaying a 10 % acrylamide slab gel ( 20 cm × 22 cm , 1 . 0 mm thick ) . The gels were dried between sheets of cellophane paper with the acid edge to the left . Duplicate gels were placed in transfer buffer ( 10 mM Caps , pH 11 containing 10 % methanol ) and transblotted onto PVDF . The blots were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R - 250 , desktop scanned , blocked for two hours in 5 % BSA in Tween - 20 in TBS ( TTBS ) and rinsed in TTBS . The blots were incubated with anti - phospho - serine and - threonine antibodies ( both 1 : 25 , 000 in 2 % BSA TTBS ) overnight . HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies were used and immunoreactivity detected with enhanced chemiluminescence ( Lumigen , Southfield , MI ) . To deter - mine the fold change in phosphorylation in proteins from E202A expressing cells , the density of individual spots on both the gels and immunoblots were determined by scanning with a laser densitometer ( Model PDSI , Molecular Dynamics Inc , Sunnyvale , CA ) that was checked for linearity with a calibrated Neutral Density Filter Set ( Melles Griot , Irvine , CA ) . The images were analyzed using Progenesis Same Spots software ( version 4 . 5 , 2011 , TotalLab , UK ) and Progenesis PG240 software ( version 2006 , TotalLab , UK ) . The level of each of the selected , fully - resolved immunoreactive spots was normalized to the relative protein level of its corresponding spot in the gel . Fold - increase in phosphorylation was calculated by comparing the wild type ratios to those from the E202A expressing samples .

The resulting pkl files were submitted for database search and protein identification to the public Mascot database search ( www . matrixscience . com , Matrix Science , London , UK ) using the following parameters : databases from NCBI , parent mass error of 1 . 3 Da , product ion error of 0 . 8 Da , enzyme used : trypsin . Up to one missed tryptic cleavage was allowed and cysteine propionamidation and methionine oxidation were considered . To identify false negatives , the following parameters were used : different organism databases , narrower error windows for the parent mass error ( 1 . 2 and then 0 . 2 Da ) or the product ion error ( 0 . 6 Da ) w , and up to two missed tryptic cleavage sites were allowed . The pkl files were also searched against an in - house PLGS database version 2 . 4 ( www . waters . com ) using similar parameters .

Approximately 1 mg of total protein was mixed with 1 . 9 ml system buffer and applied to a pre - equilibrated column at RT . The flow through was collected and reapplied to the column three times to enrich for phosphoproteins . The last 2 ml of flow through were collected and saved in 1 ml fractions . The column was washed with 5 ml of the least stringent wash buffer provided and the first 2 ml was collected in fractions of 1 ml each . The column was washed again with 5 ml of the buffer provided and then with 10 ml of distilled water . The bound phosphoproteins were eluted with 4 ml of the elution buffer provided and collected into four fractions of 1 ml each . All fractions were were immunoblotted for WDR1 .
