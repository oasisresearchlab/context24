(cid:129) Rac1 regulation of NOX2 is important for ROS genera - tion . (cid:129) Small molecule inhibitor of the Rac1 - p67 phox interaction prevents platelet activation . (cid:129) Pharmacologic targeting of Rac1 - NOX2 axis can be a viable approach for antithrombotic therapy . Summary . Background : Platelets from patients with X - linked chronic granulomatous disease or mice deﬁcient in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( phosphate ) ( NAD ( P ) H ) oxidase isoform NOX2 exhibit diminished reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation and platelet activation . Binding of Rac1 GTPase to p67 phox plays a critical role in NOX2 activation by facilitating the assembly of the NOX2 enzyme complex . Objective : We tested the hypothesis that Phox - I , a rationally designed small molecule inhibitor of Rac – p67 phox interaction , may serve as an antithrombosis agent by suppressing ROS production and platelet activa - tion . Results : Collagen - related peptide ( CRP ) induced ROS generation in a time - dependent manner . Platelets from Rac1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice or human platelets treated with NSC23766 , a speciﬁc Rac inhibitor , produced signiﬁcantly less ROS in response to CRP . Treatment of platelets with Phox - I inhibited diverse CRP - induced responses , includ - ing : ( i ) ROS generation ; ( ii ) release of P - selectin ; ( iii ) secre - tion of ATP ; ( iv ) platelet aggregation ; and ( v ) phosphorylation of Akt . Similarly , incubation of platelets with Phox - I inhibited thrombin - induced : ( i ) secretion of ATP ; ( ii ) platelet aggregation ; ( iii ) rise in cytosolic calcium ; and ( iv ) phosphorylation of Akt . In mouse models , intraperitoneal administration of Phox - I inhibited : ( i ) col - lagen - induced platelet aggregation without affecting the tail bleeding time and ( ii ) in vivo platelet adhesion / accumu - lation at the laser injury sites on the saphenous vein with - out affecting the time for complete cessation of blood loss . Conclusions : Small molecule targeting of the Rac1 – p67 phox interaction may present an antithrombosis regimen by preventing GPVI - and non - GPVI - mediated NOX2 acti - vation , ROS generation and platelet function without affecting the bleeding time .

Introduction Superoxide anion ( O 2 (cid:1) ) and its derivatives , collectively called reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , are generated in platelets and contribute to signaling events involved in platelet activation [ 1 – 4 ] . The exact mechanisms of ROS generation and signaling mechanisms involved in ROS - mediated platelet activation are still being elucidated . Although diverse biochemical reactions contribute to ROS generation in platelets , nicotinamide adenine dinu - cleotide ( phosphate ) ( NAD ( P ) H ) oxidases ( NOX ) have emerged as critical sources of agonist - induced ROS Correspondence : Huzoor Akbar , Department of Biomedical Sciences , 416 Irvine Hall , Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine , Ohio University , Athens , OH 45701 , USA Tel . : + 1 740 593 2406 E - mail : akbar @ ohio . edu Received : 21 February 2018 Manuscript handled by : W .

Six homologs of the cytochrome subunit of phagocyte NADPH oxidase ( also known as NOX2 or gp91 phox ) , namely NOX1 , NOX3 , NOX4 , NOX5 , DUOX1 and DUOX2 , have been characterized in various cells [ 5 ] . Human platelets appear to possess NOX1 [ 6 ] , NOX2 [ 6 , 7 ] , NOX4 [ 8 ] and NOX5 [ 9 ] . Platelets also con - tain cytosolic cofactors , namely p22 phox , p67 phox [ 10 ] and p47 phox , and Rac GTPase [ 11 , 12 ] . NOX2 is constitutively associated with p22 phox and its activation requires translo - cation of p47 phox , p67 phox and p40 phox as well as Rac - GTP to the NOX2 / p22 phox complex . The assembled NOX2 complex generates superoxide by transferring an electron from NADPH in the cytosol to oxygen in the extracellular space . With the emergent role of NOX in platelet activation [ 13 – 15 ] , it has been suggested that NOX2 may be a novel target for antithrombotic treatment [ 3 , 8 ] . A direct link between NOX2 activity , ROS generation and plate - let activation has been shown in patients with X - linked chronic granulomatous disease ( X - CGD ) . These patients are genetically deﬁcient in NOX2 and exhibit dimin - ished ROS generation and CD40 ligand expression in response to collagen or thrombin [ 12 ] . Moreover , plasma levels of soluble CD40 ligand and soluble P - selectin , two markers of in vivo platelet activation , are signiﬁcantly diminished in X - CGD patients [ 16 ] . Recently , the role of NOX2 in platelet activation and thrombosis has also been reported using mice geneti - cally deﬁcient in NOX2 [ 8 ] . Rac1 GTPase plays a critical role in regulation of both NOX2 [ 17 – 19 ] and NOX1 [ 20 , 21 ] . The binding of Rac1 - GTP to p67 phox facilitates its binding to NOX2 and its activation [ 18 ] , whereas binding of Rac1 - GTP to NOXA1 enhances its binding to NOX1 and its activa - tion . We have shown earlier that a rationally designed small molecule inhibitor of Rac1 – p67 phox interaction ( Phox - I ) inhibits ROS generation [ 22 ] . In this study , we tested our hypothesis that if Rac1 – p67 phox complex for - mation is critical in ROS generation , then interrupting this complex formation by Phox - I should inhibit ROS generation and consequently platelet activation . Here we report that Phox - I , by inhibiting Rac1 – p67 phox interac - tion in platelets , prevents GPVI - and non - GPVI - depen - dent NOX2 activation and the consequent ROS generation , as well as the in vivo and in vitro platelet activation without affecting the hemostatic response , pre - senting small molecule targeting of the Rac1 - NOX2 interaction as a useful antithrombosis regimen . Materials and methods Materials Chemicals and reagents were purchased either from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) , Chrono - Log Cor - poration ( Havertown , PA , USA ) or from speciﬁcally noted sources . Phox - I was custom synthesized as reported earlier [ 22 ] . Antibodies for Akt , p - Akt , ERK , p - ERK , P38 - MAPK , p - P38 - MAPK and b - tubulin were obtained from Cell Signaling ( Boston , MA , USA ) . Collection of blood and preparation of washed human plate - let suspensions All experiments using human blood from healthy volunteers were performed according to the pro - tocols approved by the Institutional Review Board at Ohio University ( Protocol # 08X126 ) , Athens , Ohio , or Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Research Foundation ( Protocol # 2010 - 1855 ) , Cincinnati , Ohio . Procedures for drawing human blood , isolation of platelet - rich plasma ( PRP ) and preparation of washed platelet suspensions are the same as reported earlier [ 23 , 24 ] . The platelet count was adjusted to 3 9 10 8 per mL for aggregation studies . Rac1 knockout mice Conditional Rac1 knockout mice , Mx - Cre ; Rac1 loxP / loxP , inducible deletion of the Rac1gene by poly I : C induction , and blood platelet harvest , were described previously [ 23 , 25 ] . All animal maintenance and procedures were approved by Cincinnati Children’s Institu - tion Animal Care and Utility Committee ( Protocol # 1E05054 ) . ROS generation Reactive oxygen species generation was quantiﬁed as reported earlier [ 4 ] . Brieﬂy , washed platelets were incubated with 2 0 7 0 - dichloroﬂuorescein ( dcf - da10 l M ) for 15 min at 37 ° C , washed once more to remove extracellular dye and ROS was detected by ﬂow cytometry . ROS generation is expressed as a % of ROS in stimulated platelets . The mean ﬂuorescence intensity ( MFI ) or the mean percentage of dcf - positive platelets were used to calculate ROS generation . Assessment of P - selectin release , ATP secretion and plate - let aggregation P - selectin release from the a - granules was quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry as described earlier [ 26 ] . Secretion of ATP from the dense granules was assessed by a luminescence method using a luciferin / luciferase kit from Chrono - Log Corporation [ 23 ] . The luciferin / lu - ciferase reagent was added to platelets 1 min prior to addition of collagen - related peptide ( CRP ) or thrombin . Platelet aggregation was monitored by a standard optical density method [ 27 ] using an Aggregometer from Chrono - Log Corporation . Measurement of platelet cytosolic calcium Platelet cytosolic calcium levels were quantiﬁed using Fura2 / AM loaded platelets . Washed human platelets were incubated with 3 l M Fura2 / AM at room temperature for 30 min . After incubation , platelets were washed twice and resus - pended in a modiﬁed Tyrode’s solution , pH 7 . 4 . Fluores - cence was recorded with a Hitachi F - 2000 ( Hitachi Medical Systems , Twinsburg , OH , USA ) ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer ( Hitachi Medical Systems , Twinsburg , © 2018 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2084 H . Akbar et al OH , USA ) and calcium levels were quantiﬁed as described earlier [ 24 ] . Assessment of platelet spreading on immobilized ﬁbrino - gen Platelet spreading on ﬁbrinogen was assayed as pre - viously described [ 4 ] . Brieﬂy , glass cover slips were coated with ﬁbrinogen overnight at 4 ° C . Non - speciﬁc binding was blocked by incubating cover slips with bovine serum albumin ( BSA , 1 % ) in Tyrode’s - HEPES buffer at 37 ° C . Cover slips were rinsed with Tyrode’s - HEPES buffer after removing BSA . Aspirin ( 1 m M ) - treated washed human platelets containing apyrase ( 3 U mL (cid:1) 1 ) were layered over cover slips in the presence or absence of Phox - I . After 10 min incubation at 37 ° C the cover slips were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) to remove free platelets . Platelets on cover slips were then ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min , rinsed with PBS twice and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 60 s . After two rinses with PBS , platelets were stained with Alexa 594 - phalloidin to visualize F - actin . A Carl Zeiss LSM - 510 confocal Axioplan 200 microscope and a Plan - Neoﬂuar 100 9 / 1 . 45 oil objective were used to generate platelet images . Digital images were processed using Zen 2007 software from Carl Zeiss ( Thornwood , NY , USA ) . Phosphorylation of Akt , ERK and P38 - MAPK Washed human platelets were stimulated with CRP or thrombin for a speciﬁed time and the reactions were terminated by the addition of 4 9 sample buffer . Western blotting of total and phospho - Akt , phospho - ERK , phospho - P38 - MAPK and b - tubulin was carried out as reported earlier [ 26 ] . Tail bleeding time measurement Tail bleeding time mea - surements were performed as described earlier [ 23 ] . Mice were anesthetized with and kept under a constant ﬂow of 2 . 5 % isoﬂurane and 0 . 35 % of oxygen . The tail was cut at 5 mm from the tip and immediately immersed in saline at 37 ° C . The bleeding time was deﬁned as the time needed for the cessation of a visible blood stream for 1 min [ 28 ] . Monitoring of the bleeding times was stopped at 10 min by cauterizing the tails to prevent excessive loss of blood . Intravital microscopy of platelet adhesion / accumulation at the laser injury sites at the saphenous vein Mice ( 12 – 16 weeks of age ) were given intraperitoneal injections of either 12 mg kg (cid:1) 1 Phox - I or dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) 30 min before laser injury . These mice were then anes - thetized with injection of ketamine / xylazine ( 100 and 10 mg kg (cid:1) 1 , respectively ) ( Med - Vet International , Met - tawa , IL , USA ) . Alexa488 - conjugated a - GPIX antibody ( clone Xia . B4 , Emfret , Eibelstadt , Germany ) was injected via retro - orbital injection . The saphenous vein was surgi - cally exposed and pulsed once with a 532 - nm laser ( 70 l J ; 100 Hz , 0 . 3 ms duration ) ( Ablate photoablation system ; Intelligent Imaging Innovations , Denver , CO , USA ) . The mice were maintained on a heated observa - tion stage and platelet response at the injury site was recorded as previously described [ 29 ] . Acquired images were analyzed with Slidebook 6 . 0 ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations ) . Statistical analysis Data are expressed as means (cid:3) standard deviation ( SD ) or standard error ( SE ) as described in the ﬁgure legends . A P value of < 0 . 05 indicates statistically signiﬁcant dif - ference between the control and test samples . Results Gene targeting or inhibition of Rac GTPase diminished CRP - induced ROS generation in platelets Rac1 / 2 GTPases have been shown to play a critical role in ROS generation by NOX2 in human and mur - ine neutrophils [ 22 ] . Rac1 is the dominant Rac isoform in platelets [ 30 ] and if Rac1 is critical for ROS genera - tion by NOX2 in blood platelets , then genetic deﬁ - ciency or inhibition of Rac1 GTPase should inhibit ROS generation . To test this possibility , we ﬁrst estab - lished that platelets stimulated with CRP generate ROS in a time - dependent manner . Addition of CRP ( 0 . 5 l g mL (cid:1) 1 ) to washed human platelets increased ROS in a time - dependent manner ( Fig . 1A ) . Next , we investigated the role of Rac1 GTPase in CRP - induced ROS generation in human platelets treated with NSC23766 , a small molecule inhibitor of Rac GTPase [ 23 , 31 , 32 ] , and in platelets from Rac1 - deﬁcient mice [ 25 , 33 ] . Addition of NSC23766 to human platelets 2 min prior to stimulation with CRP signiﬁcantly blocked ROS production ( Fig . 1B ) . As shown in Fig . 1 ( C ) , Rac1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) platelets exhibited signiﬁcantly diminished ROS generation upon stimulation with CRP . These data suggest that Rac1 is essential for GPVI - mediated ROS generation by NOX2 . Small molecule targeting of Rac1 – p67 phox interaction blocked CRP - induced ROS generation and platelet activation Rac1 GTPase binds to P67 phox and facilitates its inter - action with NOX2 . This is a critical step for ROS gen - eration by NOX2 [ 5 ] . The Arg38 and Arg102 residues of P67 phox create a deep binding pocket necessary for its binding to Rac1 GTPase . We have shown earlier that Phox - I , a small molecule , binds to the Rac1 GTPase binding pocket of P67 phox and prevents Rac1 – P67 phox interaction and consequently inhibits NOX2 and ROS generation [ 22 ] . We investigated the © 2018 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Small molecule targeting NOX2 for antithrombosis 2085 possibility that if Phox - I inhibits NOX2 activation then it should block CRP - induced ROS generation and pla - telet activation . Addition of Phox - I to human platelets 2 min before stimulation with CRP inhibited ROS gen - eration in a concentration - dependent manner ( Fig . 2A ) . Treatment of platelets with Phox - I blocked CRP - induced release of p - selectin from a - granules ( Fig . 2B ) , secretion of ATP from the dense granules ( Fig . 2C ) and platelet aggre - gation ( Fig . 2D – E ) in a concentration - dependent manner . These data show that interrupting Rac1 – P67 phox interac - tion inhibits GPVI - dependent ROS production by NOX2 and thereby blocks platelet activation . Recently , Delaney et al . [ 8 ] have reported that platelets from mice genetically deﬁcient in NOX2 exhibit diminished ROS generation and platelet aggregation in response to CRP . Our ﬁndings that inhibition of NOX2 by Phox - I prevents CRP - induced ROS generation and platelet activation concur with their ﬁnd - ings that NOX2 plays a critical role in platelet ROS genera - tion and activation . Inhibition of NOX2 by Phox - I blocked thrombin - induced platelet secretion , aggregation and calcium mobilization Thrombin , via activation of PI3kinase , regulates translocation of p67 phox to the plasma membrane [ 34 ] and thereby regulates endogenous ROS production by NOX2 . More recently , thrombin - induced platelet activation has been shown to be diminished in platelets from NOX2 - deﬁcient mice [ 8 ] , imply - ing a role for NOX2 in non - GPVI - mediated ROS generation and platelet activation . We have shown earlier that thrombin - induced ROS generation is diminished in Rac1 - deﬁcient mur - ine platelets or human platelets treated with NSC23766 or Phox - I [ 4 ] . These ﬁndings suggest that Rac1 is essential for ROS generation by non - GPVI - mediated activation of NOX2 and inhibition of the Rac1 – p67 phox interaction by Phox - I blocks NOX2 activation . Here we investigated the possibility that Phox - I , by preventing Rac1 – p67 phox interaction , would block thrombin - induced platelet activation . Human platelets were incubated with Phox - I for 2 min and then challenged with thrombin . Phox - I inhibited thrombin - induced secretion of ATP ( Fig . 3A ) , platelet aggregation ( Fig . 3B – C ) and rise in platelet cytosolic calcium in a concentration - dependent man - ner ( Fig . 3D ) . These ﬁndings suggest that NOX2 is involved in non - GPVI - mediated ROS generation and platelet activa - tion . Phox - I inhibition of platelet aggregation is surmountable Next , we investigated whether the inhibitory effect of Phox - I is permanent in nature or can be overcome by increasing the agonist concentration . Addition of Phox - I ( 10 l M ) to washed human platelets 2 min prior to addi - tion of CRP ( 0 . 3 l g mL (cid:1) 1 ) or thrombin ( 0 . 1 U mL (cid:1) 1 ) inhibited platelet aggregation ( Fig . 4 ) . Addition of higher concentrations of CRP ( Fig . 4 left panels ) or thrombin ( Fig . 4 right panels ) gradually reversed the inhibition of platelet aggregation . These data show that Phox - I inhibi - tion of platelet aggregation can be overcome by a high dose of agonists . 600 500 400 300 R O S ( % M F I ) R O S ( % M F I ) R O S ( % M F I ) 200 100 0 100 75 50 25 0 0 NSC23766 ( µM ) 10 30 1 Minutes * * * * * 3 5 10 15 100 75 50 25 0 Rac1 + / + Rac1 – / – A B C Fig . 1 .

This ﬁnding suggests that Phox - I inhibits inte - grin outside - in signaling . Phox - I inhibited CRP - induced phosphorylation of ERK and P38 - MAPK The extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) has been linked with collagen - induced platelet aggregation [ 36 ] and thrombin - induced phosphorylation of ERK and P38 - MAPK has been shown to be diminished in NOX2 knockout mice [ 37 ] . We investigated the possibility that Phox - I inhibits ROS - mediated platelet activation by inhibiting phosphorylation of ERK and or P38 - MAPK . Phox - I added to washed human platelets 2 min before addition of CRP blocked phosphorylation of ERK and P38 - MAPK ( Figure S2 ) . These ﬁndings suggest inhibition of ROS generation by NOX2 by the small molecule inhi - bitor inhibits platelet activation by inhibiting ERK / P38 - MAPK activation . Inhibition of NOX2 by Phox - I blocked CRP or thrombin - induced phosphorylation of Akt Platelet activation by diverse agonists induces activation of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) isoforms , leading to calcium mobilization , platelet activation and throm - bus formation [ 38 , 39 ] . PI3K activation leads to phos - phorylation of Akt during inside - out and outside - in signaling [ 39 – 42 ] . We investigated the possibility that Phox - I inhibits platelet aggregation by downregulating PI3K .

These data imply that inhibition of ROS generation by Phox - I blocks pla - telet aggregation , at least in part , by preventing PI3K activation . Administration of Phox - I to mice inhibited collagen - induced platelet aggregation without affecting the murine tail bleeding time The ability of Phox - I to inhibit in vitro platelet aggrega - tion suggests that it may block platelet activation in vivo . To test this possibility , we investigated the effect of intraperitoneal injection of Phox - I on collagen - induced platelet aggregation . Collagen - induced aggregation in mice given Phox - I , as compared with DMSO , is inhibited in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 7A – E ) . These data sug - gest that inhibition of Rac1 – p67 phox is effective in block - ing ex vivo platelet aggregation . Next , we investigated the possibility that Phox - I , by inhibiting platelet function , may also alter the hemostatic response . We measured the tail bleeding times in wild - type mice after 20 min of intraperitoneal administration of Phox - I or DMSO . The dot plot in Fig . 7 ( F ) shows that the tail bleeding times in the Phox - I or DMSO - treated mice are essentially the same . These ﬁndings imply that pharmacologic targeting of NOX2 may be effective in diminishing platelet aggregation without prolonging the bleeding time . 100 0 . 0 10 . 0 0 . 0 10 . 0 0 . 0 10 . 0 0 . 0 20 . 0 0 . 0 20 . 0 0 . 0 20 . 0 80 60 40 20 T r an s m i tt an c e ( % ) CR P ( 0 . 3 µg m L – 1 ) CR P ( 0 . 45 µg m L – 1 ) CR P ( 0 . 75 µg m L – 1 ) T h r o m b i n ( 0 . 125 U m L – 1 ) T h r o m b i n ( 0 . 112 U m L – 1 ) T h r o m b i n ( 0 . 1 U m L – 1 ) T r a n s m i tt an c e ( % ) T r an s m i tt an c e ( % ) T r an s m i tt an c e ( % ) T r an s m i tt an c e ( % ) T r an s m i tt an c e ( % ) 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 Phox - I ( µ M ) Phox - I ( µ M ) Phox - I ( µ M ) Phox - I ( µ M ) Phox - I ( µ M ) Phox - I ( µ M ) 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 1 2 Minutes Minutes 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 100 80 60 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 Fig . 4 .

DMSO or Phox - I was administered to wild - type mice intraperi - toneally and platelet accumulation at sites of vascular injury was monitored by intravital ﬂuorescence micro - scopy . Representative images of platelet accumulation in DMSO or Phox - I - treated mice are shown in Fig . 8 ( A ) ; the quantiﬁcation of platelet accumulation over time is shown in Fig . 8 ( B ) . In the DMSO - treated mice platelets rapidly accumulated upon laser injury to the saphenous vein . Platelets also accumulated rapidly at sites of injury in mice given Phox - I , but platelet accumulation was sig - niﬁcantly diminished when compared with DMSO - treated controls ( Fig . 8B – C ) . These data show that inhibition of NOX2 downregulates platelet - dependent thrombus for - mation in vivo . In parallel with the effects on thrombus formation , we also monitored the time to complete cessation of blood loss ( in vivo bleeding time ) following laser injury in the mice given DMSO or Phox - I . As shown in Fig . 8 ( D ) , the bleeding time was not altered by Phox - I administration . Discussion The ﬁndings in this study demonstrate that inhibition of Rac1 – p67 phox interaction by Phox - I , a rationally designed small molecule inhibitor of NOX2 , prevents ROS genera - tion and platelet activation in vitro and ex vivo and plate - let adhesion / accumulation in vivo without affecting the hemostatic response to injury . Although a possible role for ROS in platelet activation has been implicated for over 40 years [ 43 , 44 ] , a number of recent reports have shown that agonist - induced activa - tion of NOX plays a major role in ROS generation and consequent platelet activation [ 15 , 45 ] . Collagen - related peptide - induced , GPVI - dependent ROS generation has been suggested to utilize both Syk - dependent and Syk - independent signaling [ 15 ] . In addition , TRAF4 has been reported to generate ROS via the NOX1 / 2 - p47 phox axis [ 14 ] . Thrombin - induced ROS generation has been reported to involve PAR4 and GPIb a [ 13 ] . Based on these and other reports including genetic evidence in human [ 16 , 46 ] and mice [ 8 ] studies , it has been suggested that NOX2 may serve as an antithrombotic target [ 3 , 8 ] . This study was conducted to investigate this possibility by investigating the effect of Phox - I on CRP and thrombin - induced ROS generation and platelet activation . Rac1 GTPase is one of the components of the NOX2 complex and is essential for ROS generation by NOX2 [ 5 ] . Rac1 interacts with p67 phox , a cytosolic component of NOX2 , and facilitates its binding to the membrane - bound enzyme and consequent ROS generation . Our ﬁndings that CRP induces ROS generation in a time - dependent manner and platelets from Rac1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) conditional knockout mice or human platelets treated with NSC23766 , a Rac GTPase inhibitor [ 23 , 31 ] , exhibit signiﬁcantly diminished ROS generation ( Fig . 1 ) clearly demonstrate that Rac1 GTPase is essential for CRP - GPVI - mediated ROS gener - ation in platelets . We have shown earlier that the Rac1 GTPase – p67 phox interaction is critical for ROS generation by NOX2 and interrupting this interaction with Phox - I inhibits NOX2 activation and ROS generation in human and murine neutrophils [ 22 ] . Our observations that Phox - I not only inhibited ROS generation in platelets ( Fig . 2A ) , but also blocked the release of P - selectin ( Fig . 2B ) , secretion of 60 40 5 µm 5 µm * * * 20 0 P l a t e l e t a r ea ( µ m 2 ) DMSO Phox - I A B C Fig . 5 . Phox - I diminished platelet spreading on immobilized ﬁbrinogen . Washed human platelets in the absence ( A ) or presence of ( B ) Phox - I ( 10 l M ) were layered over ﬁbrinogen ( 5 l g mL (cid:1) 1 ) coated cover slips in the presence of apyrase ( 3 U mL (cid:1) 1 ) for 10 min . The cover slips were washed and adherent platelets were processed for immuno - ﬂuorescence confocal microscopy as detailed in the methods section . Platelets treated with Phox - I ( B ) , as compared with DMSO ( A ) , exhibited diminished spreading on immobilized ﬁbrinogen . ( C ) The bar graph shows that spreading of Phox - I , as compared with DMSO , is diminished ( * * * P < 0 . 05 ) .

Akbar et al ATP ( Fig . 2C ) and platelet aggregation ( Fig . 2D – E ) , sug - gest that pharmacologic targeting of NOX2 is an effective means of downregulating platelet activation . This possi - bility is further supported by a recent report that platelets from NOX2 - deﬁcient mice are defective in CRP - induced ROS generation and platelet activation [ 8 ] . Taken together these genetic and pharmacologic ﬁndings suggest that ROS generation by NOX2 plays a critical role in pla - telet activation and therefore NOX2 may serve as a thera - peutic target for controlling platelet activation by curtailing ROS supply . The X - CGD patients , because of the genetic deﬁciency of NOX2 , are susceptible to severe immunological dis - eases and infections . This raises the possibility that inhibi - tion of NOX2 by Phox - I may result in clinically unacceptable immunological side - effects . We don’t anticipate , although we can’t rule out based on the pre - sent study , that the transient inhibition of NOX2 will have similar clinical manifestations to the permanent absence of NOX2 , as the transient nature and dose dependencies of the Phox - I inhibitor are likely to be dis - tinct from those of the genetic defect in the NOX2 gene . Platelets from NOX2 - deﬁcient mice are defective not only in CRP - GPVI - induced , but also in thrombin - GPCR - induced ROS generation and platelet activation [ 8 ] . Similarly , our observations that genetic deﬁciency or inhi - bition of Rac GTPase by NSC23766 blocks thrombin - induced ROS generation [ 4 ] and platelet activation [ 23 ] suggest that Rac GTPase signaling plays a critical role in thrombin - induced ROS generation and platelet activation .

NOX2 - deﬁcient murine platelets have been shown to exhi - bit diminished aggregation in response to CRP [ 8 ] as well as thrombin [ 8 , 37 ] . We observed the same defects in CRP - induced ROS generation and aggregation in NOX2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) plate - lets ( Figure S1 ) . Furthermore , we found that the addition of Phox - I to NOX2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) platelets had only a nominal effect on CRP - induced ROS generation and aggregation ( Figure S1 ) . Inability of Phox - I to further diminish ROS generation or platelet activation suggests that Phox - I speciﬁcally inhibits NOX2 . However , the possibility that Phox - I may also inhibit NOX1 cannot be ruled out from these data .

Akbar et al NOX - generated superoxide ( O (cid:1) ) is converted to H 2 O 2 by the superoxide dismutase , which has been linked to agonist - induced calcium mobilization [ 47 , 48 ] . Platelets from NOX2 - deﬁcient mice have been shown to be defec - tive in thrombin - induced mobilization of stored calcium [ 8 ] . Our ﬁndings that Phox - I inhibited thrombin - induced rise in platelet calcium levels suggest that inhibition of NOX2 by Phox - I has a similar effect on calcium mobi - lization in thrombin - stimulated platelets ( Fig . 3D ) . Focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) has been shown to be involved in GPVI - dependent ROS generation and platelet activation [ 49 ] and Delaney et al . have reported that col - lagen - induced activation of Syk and PLC ɣ 2 is diminished in platelets from NOX2 KO mice [ 8 ] . Our ﬁndings that Phox - I did not inhibit phosphorylation of Syk , FAK or PLC ɣ 2 and inhibitors of FAK ( PF573228 ) and Syk ( BAY61 - 3606 ) inhibited phosphorylation of Syk , FAK and PLC ɣ 2 ( data not shown ) suggest that Phox - I , an inhibitor known to interrupt Rac - p67phox interaction [ 22 ] , inhibits NOX downstream of Syk , FAK and PLC ɣ 2 . The initial ROS generation by GPVI has been suggested to be independent of the Syk activation [ 14 ] . It is possible that Phox - I , regardless of the signaling events leading to NOX2 activation , prevents ROS generation by interrupt - ing the Rac – p67 – phox interaction . P38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( P38 - MAPK ) has been linked with collagen - induced platelet aggregation [ 36 ] and H 2 O 2 , a ROS byproduct , has been shown to acti - vate P38 - MAPK in different cell types , including platelets [ 4 – 6 ] . In our study , Phox - I inhibited CRP - induced phos - phorylation of P38 - MAPK as well as ERK in a concen - tration - dependent manner ( Figure S2 ) . These ﬁndings suggest that these MAPKs are involved in ROS - mediated platelet activation . However , the role of P38 - MAPK and ERK in ROS - mediated platelet activation remains to be resolved at this time as NOX2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) platelets have been reported to exhibit a decrease in [ 37 ] as well as no effect [ 8 ] on thrombin - induced phosphorylation of p38MAPK and ERK . Agonist - induced PI3K activation has been linked with platelet aggregation [ 39 ] and there is evidence that class III PI3K regulates platelet NOX and platelet activation and thrombosis via PI ( 3 ) P [ 50 ] . Agonist - induced calcium mobilization in platelets appears to correlate with PI3K signaling , as indicated by phosphorylation of Akt , as well as ERK and P38 - MAPK [ 7 , 9 ] . Our ﬁndings that inhibi - tion of NOX2 signaling by Phox - I blocked activation of Akt , a PI3K activity marker , in CRP as well as throm - bin - stimulated platelets ( Fig . 6 ) suggest that inhibition of NOX2 prevents platelet aggregation , at least in part , by inhibiting PI3K signaling .

[ Color ﬁgure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary . c om ] © 2018 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Small molecule targeting NOX2 for antithrombosis 2093 injury site ( Fig . 8 ) , but did not affect the murine tail bleeding times , are in agreement with the report by Dela - ney et al . that NOX2 - deﬁcient mice exhibit defective pla - telet aggregation and impaired laser - induced thrombosis without affecting the tail bleeding times [ 8 ] . Inhibition of platelet function carries the risk of prolonging the bleed - ing time . However , the impaired ex vivo aggregation in mice given Phox - I did not affect tail bleeding times . For the hemostatic response , that is the arrest of bleeding , only a sufﬁcient number of platelets need to aggregate to provide a surface for coagulation reactions to occur to convert ﬁbrinogen into ﬁbrin . It is the continuous perpet - uation of platelet aggregation / secretion that helps to sta - bilize and grow the size of the thrombus . Phox - I , by diminishing the secretion / aggregation reactions , reduces the adhesion / accumulation of platelets at the laser injury site . As seen in Fig . 8 , Phox - I diminished but did not completely abolish adhesion / accumulation of platelets at the laser injury site . The accumulated platelets appear to be sufﬁcient to prevent bleeding . Our work is the ﬁrst to demonstrate that a reversible inhibitor of NOX2 is capable of inhibiting platelet func - tion in vitro and in vivo without altering the hemostatic response . Intravital imaging studies , in our unique model of laser injury to the saphenous vein [ 29 ] , to evaluate pla - telet adhesion at sites of vascular injury show that platelet accumulation is reduced by Phox - I ( i . e . the hemostatic plugs are much smaller in the presence of the inhibitor ) ( Fig . 8 ) . We extrapolate from these ﬁndings that throm - bosis ( i . e . the formation of occlusive thrombi ) would be strongly impaired by the presence of Phox - 1 , similar to what is observed in mice treated with the P2Y12 inhibi - tor , clopidogrel [ 29 , 51 ] . Based on these data we conclude that pharmacologic targeting of NOX2 may effectively downregulate platelet activation without disrupting the normal hemostatic response . Addendum H .
