Para - nitro - L - phenylalanine ( pN - Phe ) is a nitroaromatic 35 amino acid with uses including immune stimulation and fluorescence quenching . As the chemical 36 synthesis of pN - Phe does not follow green chemistry principles and impedes provision of pN - Phe 37 to engineered bacterial cells in some contexts , we sought to design a de novo biosynthetic pathway 38 for pN - Phe in Escherichia coli . To generate the nitro chemical functional group , we identified 39 natural diiron monooxygenases with measurable in vitro and in vivo activity on envisioned amine - 40 containing precursors of para - amino - L - phenylalanine ( pA - Phe ) and para - aminophenylpyruvate . 41 By expressing one of these N - oxygenase genes together with previously characterized genes for 42 the biosynthesis of pA - Phe , we achieved the synthesis of pN - Phe from glucose . Through further 43 optimization of the chassis , plasmid constructs , and media conditions , we were able to improve 44 the selectivity of pN - Phe biosynthesis , resulting in a maximum titer of 819 µM in rich defined 45 media under shake - flask conditions . These results provide a foundation for the biosynthesis of 46 related nitroaromatic chemicals and for downstream biological applications that could utilize pN - 47 Phe as a building block . 48 1 . Introduction 49 Nitro - group containing compounds , and particularly nitroaromatics , are an important class of 50 chemicals with industrial applications as herbicides , energetic materials , and pharmaceuticals 51 ( Booth , 2000 ) . In biological environments , the polarity of nitro - groups generates unique binding 52 interactions with protein receptors and other molecules which enables application of 53 nitroaromatics as antibiotics , antiparasitics , and chemotherapeutics ( Nepali et al . , 2019 ; Strauss , 54 1979 ) . Specifically , the strong π electron delocalizing properties of the nitro group within aromatic 55 3 systems can enhance intermolecular interactions including arene - arene and aryl hydrogen anion 56 bonding interactions ( Bryantsev and Hay , 2005 ; Lewis et al . , 2012 ; Shorter , 2009 ) . While proteins 57 could also benefit from the installation of these properties at specific sites , none of the twenty 58 standard amino acids exhibit similar levels of electron - withdrawing potential . For this and other 59 reasons , researchers have been interested in using genetic code expansion technology to 60 incorporate nitroaromatic non - standard amino acids ( nsAAs ) within proteins ( Arbely et al . , 2012 ; 61 Chen et al . , 2009 ; Deiters et al . , 2006 ; Gautier et al . , 2010 ; Hancock et al . , 2010 ; Hemphill et al . , 62 2013 ; Lemke et al . , 2007 ; Neumann et al . , 2008 ; Nguyen et al . , 2014 ; Peters et al . , 2009 ; Stokes et 63 al . , 2009 ; Tsao et al . , 2006 ; Wang et al . , 2013 , 2010 ; Welegedara et al . , 2018 ; Wilkins et al . , 2010 ; 64 Wu et al . , 2004 ; Yanagisawa et al . , 2012 ) . The nitroaromatic non - standard amino acid para - nitro - 65 L - phenylalanine ( pN - Phe ) in particular has been utilized in several diverse applications including 66 as a peptide distance marker ( Tsao et al . , 2006 ) , a breaker of immune self - tolerance ( Gauba et al . , 67 2011 ; Grünewald et al . , 2009 , 2008 ) , a nitroreductase activity enhancer ( Jackson et al . , 2006 ) , and 68 an internal protein IR probe ( Smith et al . , 2011 ) . 69 To date , the reliance on the supplementation of chemically synthesized pN - Phe has 70 constrained the performance of cells that are engineered to harness this building block and limited 71 their potential end - applications . Microbial biosynthesis of nsAAs presents a promising alternative 72 because it eliminates external supplementation requirements , circumvents cellular uptake 73 limitations , and lowers toxicity through on - demand synthesis and incorporation ( Dickey et al . , 74 2021 ; Völler and Budisa , 2017 ) . Moreover , the ability to biosynthesize nsAAs from simple carbon 75 sources should allow microbes to perform augmented protein functions autonomously in 76 environmental and therapeutic contexts where provision is not possible ( Parker and Kunjapur , 77 2020 ) . Pioneering work has achieved biosynthesis of a limited number of nsAAs , including para - 78 4 amino - L - phenylalanine ( pA - Phe ) ( Chen et al . , 2018 ; Mehl et al . , 2003 ) , L - dihydroxyphenylalanine 79 ( Kim et al . , 2018 ) , 4 - nitro - L - tryptophan ( Zuo and Ding , 2019 ) , 5 - hydroxytryptophan ( Chen et al . , 80 2020 ) , and propargylglycine ( Marchand et al . , 2019 ) . While significant advancements , these 81 nsAAs are found in nature and were produced in model microbes by transplanting naturally 82 occurring and highly specific pathways . To our knowledge , pN - Phe has not been found in nature 83 ( Parry et al . , 2011 ; Waldman et al . , 2017 ) and would thus require de novo pathway design for its 84 biosynthesis . 85 Design of metabolic syntheses for nitroaromatic products such as pN - Phe can also provide 86 an alternative to the harsh acidic reaction conditions and poor regioselectivity of traditional 87 chemical nitration ( Badgujar et al . , 2016 ; Liu et al . , 2009 ; Yan and Yang , 2013 ) . To construct a 88 metabolic pathway that achieves biosynthesis of pN - Phe , we anticipated that nitro group formation 89 could proceed from aromatic metabolites via one of the two major characterized methods of 90 enzymatic nitro synthesis : biocatalytic direct nitration or amine oxidation ( Sulzbach and Kunjapur , 91 2020 ; Winkler and Hertweck , 2007 ) . Biocatalytic direct nitration is a process dependent on two 92 enzymatic steps : ( 1 ) the cytochrome P450 - mediated nitration of aromatic rings using O2 and nitric 93 oxide ( NO ) and ( 2 ) the synthesis of reactive NO from the activity of nitric oxide synthases ( NOS ) 94 ( Caranto , 2019 ) . To date , only two P450 / NOS pairs for aromatic direct nitration have been 95 identified , and neither has demonstrated activity to nitrate phenylalanine ( Barry et al . , 2012 ; 96 Dodani et al . , 2016 ; Tomita et al . , 2017 ; Zuo et al . , 2017 ) . Amine oxidation , on the other hand , is 97 a promising route for pN - Phe synthesis for two reasons . First , the metabolic synthesis of the amine 98 precursor , pA - Phe has been demonstrated from multiple natural gene clusters ( commonly referred 99 to as papABC ) ( Chen et al . , 2018 ; Masuo et al . , 2016 ; Mehl et al . , 2003 ) . Second , a promising 100 amine oxidizing enzyme , or N - oxygenase ( ObaC , otherwise referred to in the literature as ObiL ) , 101 5 was recently discovered in Pseudomonas fluorescens in the biosynthetic gene cluster for the 102 antibiotic obafluorin . Preliminary and indirect evidence suggests that this N - oxygenase has native 103 activity on para - aminophenylpyruvate ( pA - Pyr ) , the immediate precursor to pA - Phe in metabolic 104 synthesis ( Schaffer et al . , 2017 ; Scott et al . , 2017 ) . Despite exploration of several N - oxygenases 105 like ObaC with diiron monooxygenase activity , namely AurF ( Chanco et al . , 2014 ) ( with a native 106 substrate of para - aminobenzoic acid ) and CmlI ( Tsutsumi et al . , 2018 ) ( with a native substrate of 107 the amine precursor to chloramphenicol ) as potential in vitro catalysts for nitroaromatic product 108 synthesis , thus far , no N - oxygenases have been used in vivo for de novo biosynthetic cascades 109 despite their promise and demonstrated activity in E . coli . 110 Here , we constructed and tested a de novo biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli based on 111 the following enzymes ( Fig . 1 ) : ( i ) Three enzymes from the chloramphenicol biosynthesis pathway 112 in Streptomyces venezuelae that generate pA - Phe from chorismate ; ( ii ) the putative N - oxygenase 113 ObaC ; ( iii ) the ability of native E . coli aminotransferases to convert keto acids to amino acids 114 ( Hayashi et al . , 1993 ; Onuffer et al . , 1995 ) . Upon confirmation of de novo pN - Phe biosynthesis , 115 we transferred the proposed enzymes to a chorismate overproducing strain of E . coli which further 116 improved product titers . We then performed sequence similarity analysis to identify N - oxygenase 117 enzymes related to those previously characterized and identified a candidate ( NO16 ) that achieves 118 higher conversion of pA - Phe than ObaC . Integration of this N - oxygenase improved pN - Phe titers 119 with maximum titer observed in MOPS - EZ rich defined media . 120 121 122 6 123 124 Figure 1 .

To enable the compatibility of this strain with 146 T7 - promoter systems , the 4521 bp region of the phage T7 genome that is responsible for T7 147 polymerase functionality ( lacI , lacZ , and T7 RNA polymerase ) was genomically integrated using 148 one - step clonetegration with the pOSIP - TH plasmid .

Confluent overnight cultures 190 were then used to inoculate experimental cultures in 300 µL volumes in a 96 - deep - well plate 191 ( Thermo Scientific™ 260251 ) at 100x dilution . Cultures were supplemented with 0 . 5 mM of 192 heterologous metabolites ( pA - Phe , pA - Pyr , pN - Pyr , pN - Phe ) , with pN - Pyr requiring an addition 193 of 15 µL of DMSO ( ~ 5 % final concentration ) for solubility . Cultures were incubated at 37 ºC with 194 shaking at 1000 RPM and an orbital radius of 3 mm . Compounds were quantified from the 195 extracellular broth over a 24 h period using HPLC . 196 For toxicity testing , cultures were similarly prepared with confluent overnight cultures of 197 MG1655 ( DE3 ) used to inoculate experimental cultures at 100x dilution in 200 µL volumes in a 198 10 Greiner clear bottom 96 well plate ( Greiner 655090 ) in LBL media .

Cultures were incubated at 37 ºC 206 with shaking at 1000 RPM and an orbital radius of 3 mm until an OD 600 of 0 . 5 - 0 . 8 was reached . 207 OD 600 was measured using a Thermo Scientific™ BioMate™ 160 UV - Vis Spectrophotometer . At 208 this point , the pathway plasmids were fully induced with addition of corresponding inducer ( 1 mM 209 IPTG , 1 mM vanillate , or 0 . 2 nM aTc ) , and the metabolite of interest was supplemented at this 210 time . Cultures were incubated over 24 h at 37 ºC with sampling and metabolite concentration 211 measured via supernatant sampling and submission to HPLC . 212 For pN - Phe synthesis testing , cultures were inoculated with overnight culture grown in LBL - 213 glucose media . Cultures were inoculated at 100x dilution from confluent overnight culture in 50 214 mL of the corresponding media with appropriate antibiotics in 250 mL baffled shake flasks and 215 grown at 37 ºC at 250 RPM . Expression vectors were fully induced at OD 600 0 . 5 - 0 . 8 , and then 216 were cultured at 30 ºC . Synthesis of metabolites was quantified via supernatant sampling over 24 217 h and analysis by HPLC . Compound confirmation was performed by UPLC - MS . 218 2 . 4 . Overexpression and purification of N - oxygenases 219 A strain of E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) harboring a pZE plasmid encoding expression of an N - 220 oxygenase with a hexahistidine tag at either the N - terminus or C - terminus ( NB01 , NB02 , NB03 , 221 11 or NB38 ) was inoculated from frozen stocks and grown to confluence overnight in 5 mL LBL 222 containing kanamycin . Confluent cultures were used to inoculate 400 mL of experimental culture 223 of LBL supplemented with kanamycin . The culture was incubated at 37 ºC until an OD 600 of 0 . 5 - 224 0 . 8 was reached while in a shaking incubator at 250 RPM . N - oxygenase expression was induced 225 by addition of anhydrotetracycline ( 0 . 2 nM ) and cultures were incubated at 30 ºC for 5 h . Cultures 226 were then grown at 20 ºC for an additional 18 h . Cells were centrifuged using an Avanti J - 15R 227 refrigerated Beckman Coulter centrifuge at 4 ºC at 4 , 000 g for 15 min . Supernatant was then 228 aspirated and pellets were resuspended in 8 mL of lysis buffer ( 25 mM HEPES , 10 mM imidazole , 229 300 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , pH 7 . 4 ) and disrupted via sonication using a QSonica Q125 sonicator 230 with cycles of 5 s at 75 % amplitude and 10 s off for 5 minutes . The lysate was distributed into 231 microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 1 h at 18 , 213X g at 4 ºC . The protein - containing 232 supernatant was then removed and loaded into a HisTrap Ni - NTA column using an ÄKTA Pure 233 GE FPLC system . Protein was washed with 3 column volumes ( CV ) at 60 mM imidazole and 4 234 CV at 90 mM imidazole . N - oxygenase was eluted in 250 mM imidazole in 1 . 5 mL fractions . 235 Selected fractions were denatured in Lamelli SDS reducing sample buffer ( 62 . 5 mM Tris - HCl , 236 1 . 5 % SDS , 8 . 3 % glycerol , 1 . 5 % beta - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 005 % bromophenol blue ) for 10 minutes 237 at 95 ºC and subsequently run on an SDS - PAGE gel with a Thermo Scientific PageRuler TM 238 Prestained Plus ladder to identify protein containing fractions and confirm their size . The N - 239 oxygenase containing fractions were combined applied to an Amicon column ( 10 kDa MWCO ) 240 and the buffer was diluted 1 , 000x into a 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 5 % glycerol buffer . 241 2 . 5 . N - oxygenase expression testing 242 To test expression of the N - oxygenase ladder , 5 mL cultures of NB17 - NB37 were inoculated 243 in 5 mL cultures of LBL containing 50 μg / mL kanamycin and then grown at 37 ºC until mid - 244 12 exponential phase ( OD = 0 . 5 - 0 . 8 ) . At this time , cultures were induced via addition of 0 . 2 nM aTc 245 and then grown at 30 ºC for 5 h before growing at 20 ºC for an additional 18 h . After this time , 1 246 mL of cells was mixed with 0 . 05 mL of glass beads and then vortexed using a Vortex Genie 2 for 247 15 minutes . After this time , the lysate was centrifuged at 18 , 213 g at 4 ºC for 30 minutes . Lysate 248 was denatured as described in Section 2 . 5 and then subsequently run on an SDS - PAGE gel with 249 an Invitrogen BenchMark™ His - tagged Protein Standard ladder and then analyzed via western 250 blot with an HRP - conjugated 6 * His His - Tag Mouse McAB primary antibody . The blot was 251 visualized using an Amersham ECL Prime chemiluminescent detection reagent . 252 2 . 6 . In vitro N - oxygenase activity assay 253 Reactions were performed in 1 mL volumes consisting of 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 0 , 25 mM 254 NaCl , and 1 . 5 % H 2 O 2 with 1 mM pA - Phe or pA - Pyr . The reaction mixture was incubated for 3 h 255 at 25 o C with 10 µM purified N - oxygenase , following which protein was removed by filtering 256 through a 10 K Amicon centrifugal filter unit . The eluent was then analyzed by HPLC . pN - Phe 257 production was further confirmed via UPLC - MS . 258 2 . 7 . HPLC Analysis 259 Metabolites of interest were quantified via high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) 260 using an Agilent 1260 Infinity model equipped with a Zorbax Eclipse Plus - C18 column . To 261 quantify amine containing metabolites , an initial mobile phase of solvent A / B = 100 / 0 was used 262 ( solvent A , 20 mM potassium phosphate , pH 7 . 0 ; solvent B , acetonitrile / water at 50 / 50 ) and 263 maintained for 7 min . A gradient elution was performed ( A / B ) with : gradient from 100 / 0 to 50 / 50 264 for 7 - 17 min , gradient from 50 / 50 to 100 / 00 for 17 - 18 min , equilibration at 100 / 0 for 18 - 22 min . 265 A flow rate of 0 . 5 mL min - 1 was maintained and absorption was monitored at 210 and 320 nm . To 266 quantify nitro - group containing metabolites , we used an initial mobile phase of solvent A / B = 267 13 100 / 0 ( solvent A , water , 0 . 1 % trifluoroacetic acid ; solvent B , acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % trifluoroacetic 268 acid ) and maintained for 5 min . A gradient elution ( A / B ) was then performed with : gradient from 269 100 / 0 to 95 / 5 over 5 - 7 min , gradient from 95 / 5 to 90 / 10 over 7 - 10 min , gradient from 90 / 10 to 270 80 / 20 over 10 - 16 min , gradient from 80 / 20 to 70 / 30 over 16 - 19 min , gradient from 70 / 30 to 0 / 100 271 over 19 - 21 min , 0 / 100 over 21 - 23 min , gradient from 0 / 100 to 100 / 0 over 23 - 24 min , and 272 equilibration at 100 / 0 over 24 - 25 min . The nitro product quantifying method used flow rate of 0 . 5 273 mL min - 1 and monitored absorption at 280 and 320 nm . 274 2 . 8 . Mass Spectrometry 275 Mass spectrometry ( MS ) measurements for small molecule metabolites were submitted to a 276 Waters Acquity UPLC H - Class coupled to a single quadrupole mass detector 2 ( SQD2 ) with an 277 electrospray ionization source . Metabolite compounds were analyzed using a Waters Cortecs 278 UPLC C18 column with an initial mobile phase of solvent A / B = 95 / 5 ( solvent A , water , 0 . 1 % 279 formic acid ; solvent B , acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % formic acid ) with a gradient elution from ( A / B ) 95 / 5 to 280 5 / 95 over 5 min . Flow rate was maintained at 0 . 5 mL min - 1 . For samples collected from E . coli 281 growth cultures , an initial submission to an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system with a Zorbax 282 Eclipse Plus C18 column was used to collect pN - Phe elution peaks for enhanced MS resolution . 283 A 100 uL injection was made with an initial mobile phase of solvent A / B = 95 / 5 ( solvent A , water , 284 0 . 1 % trifluoroacetic acid ; solvent B , acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % trifluoroacetic acid ) and maintained for 1 285 min . A gradient elution was then performed ( A / B ) with : gradient from 95 / 5 to 50 / 50 over 1 - 24 286 min , gradient from 50 / 50 to 95 / 5 over 24 - 25 min , equilibration at 95 / 5 for 25 - 27 min . Flow rate 287 was 1 mL / min and metabolites were tracked at 270 nm . pN - Phe elution was identified at 7 . 20 min 288 using a chemical standard and this peak was collected for submission to UPLC - MS . 289 290 14 3 . Results 291 3 . 1 . Pathway Metabolite Stability and Toxicity 292 To initially determine whether the nitroaromatic compounds and their amine precursors in our 293 proposed pathway were non - toxic , we performed toxicity testing in a 96 deep - well plate format . 294 Here , we supplemented 1 mM of our envisioned pathway metabolites ( pA - Phe , pA - Pyr , pN - Phe , 295 and pN - Pyr ) into cultures of E . coli MG1655 ( DE3 ) at inoculation in LBL media with addition of 296 5 % DMSO to aid metabolite solubility . We grew cultures and monitored cell density , observing 297 minimal effect of metabolite addition on doubling time with the exception of the metabolite pN - 298 Pyr , which increased doubling time from 27 . 4 ± 0 . 1 min to 54 . 8 ± 0 . 6 min ( Fig . 2A ) . Fortunately , 299 neither the aromatic amines nor pN - Phe exhibited notable toxicity . 300 We then performed stability testing in a similar manner , with candidate metabolites added at 301 0 . 5 mM concentration at inoculation for cultivation at 37 ºC ( Fig . 2B ) . After 24 h , pN - Phe 302 concentration remained at 71 ± 12 % of its initial value , indicating promising stability , whereas 303 only 32 ± 9 % of the initial pN - Pyr supplied remained . We hypothesized that pN - Pyr may be a 304 substrate of native E . coli aminotransferases given previously published in vitro data on activity 305 of the aminotransferase TyrB ( Hayashi et al . , 1993 ; Onuffer et al . , 1995 ) . This possible cause of 306 instability would be convenient for our pathway design as the final pathway step would be 307 catalyzed natively . We performed an additional experiment to monitor pN - Pyr and pN - Phe 308 concentrations simultaneously after supplementation of 0 . 25 mM pN - Pyr to E . coli MG1655 309 ( DE3 ) at inoculation ( Fig . 2C ) . Here , we found that 75 ± 13 % of supplemented pN - Pyr was 310 converted to pN - Phe after 24 h , confirming that endogenous E . coli enzymes will convert pN - Pyr 311 to pN - Phe . 312 313 15 314 Figure 2 .

Sample size is n = 3 using biological replicates . Data shown 322 are mean ± standard deviation . 323 324 16 3 . 2 . Initial N - oxygenase Characterization 325 Given that E . coli synthesis of pA - Phe and pA - Pyr has previously been established , we sought to 326 identify an N - oxygenase that can fully oxidize pA - Phe or pA - Pyr . There are four distinct types of 327 N - oxygenase that have been characterized to date ( Nóbile et al . , 2021 ) : ( i ) Flavin - dependent 328 monooxygenases , ( ii ) Heme - oxygenase - like diiron oxygenases , ( iii ) Rieske - type N - oxygenases , 329 and ( iv ) Non - heme diiron monooxygenases . Investigation into flavin - dependent monooxygenases 330 has shown that they commonly act on amine - containing sugars ( Huynh et al . , 2020 ; Thoden et al . , 331 2013 ) . Additionally , studies on the substrate scope of heme - oxygenase - like diiron oxygenases 332 have been fairly limited ( imidazole and N ω - methyl - l - arginine ) ( Hedges and Ryan , 2019 ; Ng et al . , 333 2019 ) . While the Rieske - type N - oxygenase PrnD has previously demonstrated activity on pA - 334 Phe , reconstitution of Rieske N - oxygenases in vivo has been challenging in E . coli due to limits in 335 iron - sulfur cluster incorporation into enzymatic cores ( Tiwari et al . , 2011 ) . Previous studies have 336 demonstrated the activity of the characterized non - heme diiron monooxygenase - type N - 337 oxygenases AurF ( Winkler and Hertweck , 2005 ) and CmlI ( Lu et al . , 2012 ) in vivo , but neither 338 have been shown to effectively convert pA - Phe to pN - Phe ( Chanco et al . , 2014 ) . More recent work 339 identified putative diiron monooxygenase ObaC in the synthesis of obafluorin . In that work , the 340 activity of ObaC on pA - Pyr was indirectly demonstrated via a colorimetric assay wherein NADH 341 oxidation led to color shift in the presence of phenazine methosulfate , iron ( II ) sulfate and ObaC 342 ( Schaffer et al . , 2017 ) . Additional combination of ObaC with ObaH and ObaG identified a nitro - 343 containing final product via mass spectrometry , but confirmation of full oxidation of pA - Pyr to 344 pN - Pyr was not measured via mass spectrometry . To confirm ObaC activity on pA - Pyr and test 345 activity on pA - Phe , we prepared three ObaC fusions ( ObaC - C term His 6x , N term His 6x - ObaC , and 346 N term βgal - ObaC - C term His 6x [ βgal - ObaC ] ) and performed Ni - NTA chromatography . We isolated 347 17 proteins of correct size for NtermHis6x - ObaC and βgal - ObaC , but were unable to isolate ObaC - 348 CtermHis6x . We then performed in vitro characterization on N term His 6x - ObaC and βgal - ObaC 349 using H 2 O 2 as a reductant to recycle the enzyme’s diiron core ( Chanco et al . , 2014 ) . Using 10 µM 350 purified enzymes , we ran reactions containing 1 . 5 % H 2 O 2 over 3 h with 1 mM of either pA - Pyr or 351 pA - Phe . Our initial results indicated that N term His 6x - ObaC was unable to achieve sufficient activity 352 on pA - Pyr or pA - Phe for measurement on HPLC . However , reactions run with pA - Pyr and pA - 353 Phe using βgal - ObaC obtained 127 ± 6 µM pN - Pyr and 105 ± 15 µM pN - Phe , respectively ( Fig . 354 3A ) . Using UPLC - MS analysis , the pA - Phe supplemented experiment was confirmed to produce 355 pN - Phe . 356 To validate ObaC activity in vivo , we performed a supplementation experiment with an 357 MG1655 strain harboring a pZE plasmid vector bearing the obaC gene . Here , we grew cultures to 358 mid - exponential phase , and then supplemented cultures with either pA - Pyr or pA - Phe and induced 359 ObaC expression . These experiments resulted in extracellular production of 31 ± 1 µM pN - Phe 360 with pA - Pyr supplementation or 240 ± 20 µM pN - Phe with pA - Phe supplementation after 24 h 361 ( Fig . 3B ) , demonstrating that ObaC could act on either pathway intermediate . Our low titers 362 suggest that pA - Pyr or pA - Phe may be transport - limited upon supplementation and that pA - Phe 363 may enter cells more easily than pA - Pyr . 364 18 365 Figure 3 .

( B ) In vivo 367 supplementation testing of MG1655 ( DE3 ) expressing βgal - ObaC in the conversion of 2 mM 368 supplemented pA - Pyr or pA - Phe to pN - Phe end product after 24 h of fermentative growth . Sample 369 size is n = 3 using biological replicates . Data shown are mean ± standard deviation . 370 19 3 . 3 . Implementation of a de novo pN - Phe synthesis pathway 371 Given demonstrated activity of ObaC on desired aromatic amines and native conversion of 372 pN - Pyr to pN - Phe , we then sought to confirm synthesis of pA - Phe using the PapABC enzymes . 373 We chose to utilize the papABC genes from S . venezuelae rather than homologues in P . fluorescens 374 given results from a previous study that suggested that the S . venezuelae enzymes result in greater 375 pA - Phe titer ( Chen et al . , 2018 ) . To start , we obtained the papABC operon from the Mehl Lab in 376 the pLASC - lppPW plasmid and then moved these into an IPTG inducible pCola plasmid under the 377 control of an IPTG - inducible T7 - promoter system . Initial shake flask testing of this construct in E . 378 coli MG1655 ( DE3 ) using M9 - glucose minimal media resulted in low 24h post - induction pA - Phe 379 titers of < 10 µM ( Fig . 4A , NB06 ) . Expression of the feedback - resistant DAHP aldolase AroG * , 380 which is known to enhance shikimate pathway flux ( Kunjapur et al . , 2014 ) , was tested using an 381 IPTG - inducible pACYC plasmid under the control T7 - promoter system with pCola - papABC 382 ( NB07 ) . This strain resulted in significant 24 h post - induction pA - Phe titer of 624 ± 79 µM . 383 We then incorporated the N - oxygenase ObaC into the pathway in a format using two plasmids : ( i ) 384 a pACYC vector expressing AroG * and ObaC in an operon and ( ii ) the pCola vector expressing 385 the PapABC operon ( NB08 ) . Here we first obtained de novo biosynthesis of pN - Phe , with a titer 386 of 83 ± 13 µM pN - Phe and 46 ± 5 µM pA - Phe ( Fig . 4A ) . We confirmed that the product mass of 387 the peak of interest corresponded to pN - Phe by UPLC - MS analysis of a second NB08 fermentation 388 in minimal media supplemented with glucose . Then , we cloned a single pCola vector expressing 389 AroG * and ObaC in an IPTG - inducible operon and PapABC on an additional IPTG - inducible 390 operon and expressed this in MG1655 ( DE3 ) ( NB09 ) ( Fig . 4B ) . This strain demonstrated superior 391 pN - Phe synthesis achieving a higher 24h post - induction titer of pN - Phe of 149 ± 5 µM in addition 392 to a higher titer of pA - Phe of 153 ± 22 µM . 393 20 394 Figure 4 .

( A ) Titer of pA - Phe and pN - Phe in different 395 strains expressing pathway enzymes following 24 h of fermentation in M9 - glucose ( 1 . 5 % ) minimal 396 media Sample size is n = 3 using biological replicates .

( C ) 398 Depiction of the E . coli NST37 ( DE3 ) ΔPheA strain engineered for enhanced pN - Phe titer through 399 chorismate . Inactivated enzymes are shown with a red cross and feedback - resistant versions of 400 enzymes are shown with a star ( * ) . GIK , glucokinase ; AroG , phenylalanine - sensitive Phospho - 2 - 401 dehydro - 3 - deoxyheptonate ( DAHP ) synthase ; AroF , tyrosine - sensitive DAHP synthase ; AroH , 402 tryptophan - sensitive DAHP synthase ; TyrA and PheA , TyrA and PheA subunits of the chorismate 403 mutase ; TrpE , anthranilate synthase component I ; TyrR , transcriptional regulatory protein . 404 21 To further enhance titer , we purchased a commercially available phenylalanine overproducer 405 strain and performed several modifications to improve its suitability for pN - Phe biosynthesis . We 406 inactivated the expression of the initial enzyme which converts chorismate flux to phenylalanine , 407 PheA ( Rodriguez et al . , 2014 ) . We additionally performed genomic integration of the T7 - 408 polymerase and lacI and lacZ genes for use with our plasmid setup , creating the NST37 ( DE3 ) 409 ΔpheA strain . This strain is unable to express functional proteins for the synthesis of all three 410 standard aromatic amino acids ( TyrA , TrpE , PheA ) and a shikimate pathway regulator ( TyrR ) . 411 Furthermore , the strain expresses feedback inhibition enzyme variants ( AroF * and AroG * ) to 412 enhance shikimate pathway flux , which should result in greater accumulation of chorismate ( Fig . 413 4C ) . Using this modified strain , we transformed both the two - plasmid system as previously 414 described ( NB15 ) and the single plasmid system ( NB16 ) and performed shake - flask fermentation 415 over 24 h in M9 - glucose minimal media . Here , we achieved our highest measured titer of 260 ± 416 11 µM using the single plasmid system . Despite promising pN - Phe titer , in the case of the single 417 plasmid system , the unconverted pA - Phe titer remained quite high at 454 ± 28 µM . 418 3 . 4 . Broad N - oxygenase screening and pathway implementation 419 Previous studies using genetic code expansion for site - specific translation of pN - Phe into 420 proteins have supplemented 1 mM of the nsAA into culture to achieve incorporation ( Grünewald 421 et al . , 2008 ; Tsao et al . , 2006 ) , but lower concentrations of nsAA were not tested . While the 422 obtained titer of approximately 250 µM may be sufficient for incorporation , high accumulation of 423 pA - Phe could result in off - target nsAA incorporation if a strain were to perform biosynthesis and 424 site - specific nsAA incorporation . Additionally , poor selectivity of pN - Phe biosynthesis would 425 complicate downstream isolation of the small molecule product if that option were to be pursued . 426 Thus , to improve product titer and make pN - Phe the dominant nsAA product , we sought to identify 427 22 an N - oxygenase enzyme with improved activity on pA - Phe . Previously characterized non - heme 428 diiron monooxygenases have demonstrated activity on diverse aromatic amines and compatibility 429 with expression in E . coli , but ObaC is the only diiron monooxygenase thus far to exhibit full 430 oxidation of pA - Phe to pN - Phe . To assess the broader space of N - oxygenase enzymes , we used 431 NCBI BLAST to obtain the 1000 most closely related sequences as measured by BLASTP 432 alignment score from four characterized diiron monooxygenase - type N - oxygenases with activity 433 on aromatic amines : AurF , CmlI , AzoC ( Guo et al . , 2019 ) , and ObaC . After deleting duplicate 434 sequences , we obtained 2134 unique sequences which we then submitted to the Enzyme Function 435 Initiative - Enzyme Similarity Tool ( EFI - EST ) ( Gerlt et al . , 2015 ) to generate a sequence similarity 436 network ( SSN ) . Sequences exhibiting greater than 95 % similarity were grouped into single nodes , 437 resulting in 775 unique nodes and a minimum alignment score of 100 was selected for node edges . 438 We visualized the SSN using Cytoscape ( Fig . 5 ) . 439 440 23 441 Figure 5 . Sequence similarity network generated using 2134 unique putative diiron 442 monooxygenase sequences determined from NCBI BLAST of the N - oxygenases AurF , CmlI , 443 AzoC , and ObaC represented as 775 unique nodes . Edges are drawn between nodes with minimum 444 alignment score of 100 . Previously characterized N - oxygenases are highlighted in yellow ( PvfB 445 ( Kretsch et al . , 2018 ) , PsAAO ( Platter et al . , 2011 ) , CmlI ( Knoot et al . , 2016 ; Lu et al . , 2012 ) , 446 AzoC ( Guo et al . , 2019 ) , AurF ( RJ ) ( Indest et al . , 2015 ) , AurF ( Seong Choi et al . , 2008 ) , AlmD 447 ( Cortina et al . , 2011 ) , HamC ( Jenul et al . , 2018 ) , and BezJ ( Tsutsumi et al . , 2018 ) ) , putative N - 448 oxygenases cloned and tested in this study are highlighted in white , and ObaC is shown in gray 449 with black outline . 450 24 To test a diverse set of N - oxygenase enzymes , we selected twenty - one distinct sequences from 451 18 different clusters to obtain diversity in the diiron monooxygenase sequence space from those 452 currently characterized and ordered gene fragments to clone these into a pZE expression vector 453 with a C - terminal hexahistidine tag . All but one of these N - oxygenases ( NO20 , also known as 454 BezJ ) ( Tsutsumi et al . , 2018 ) ) were previously uncharacterized . We initially tested the expression 455 of these proteins in E . coli by transforming them into MG1655 ( DE3 ) for subsequent overnight 456 expression . Analysis of the lysate using anti - His western blotting confirmed the soluble synthesis 457 of all the N - oxygenases except NO6 , NO13 , NO18 , and NO20 . We then tested the N - oxygenases 458 in MG1655 ( DE3 ) by growing them in LBL media to mid - exponential phase , at which time , we 459 supplemented cultures with 1 mM pA - Phe and induced N - oxygenase expression . Fermentation 460 with metabolically active cells for 24 h at 30 o C revealed that only one of the additional N - 461 oxygenases resulted in pN - Phe production apart from ObaC . This N - oxygenase was NO16 from 462 Pseudomonas sp . EMN2 , which exhibited greater than twice the pN - Phe production in the initial 463 screen ( Table 1 ) . Previous reports of para - aminobenzoic acid testing have noted activity in 464 enzymes across different clusters ( PsAAO ( Platter et al . , 2011 ) , AurF ( Seong Choi et al . , 2008 ) , 465 and HamC ( Jenul et al . , 2018 ) ) , which we did not observe for pA - Phe . Following the initial in vivo 466 screen , we purified NO16 with a C - terminal hexahistidine tag and performed a 3 h in vitro reaction 467 containing 1 . 5 % H 2 O 2 with 1 mM of either pA - Pyr or pA - Phe . In comparison to ObaC , we 468 obtained similar titer of pN - Pyr in this case ( 120 ± 3 µM final concentration pN - Pyr ) and a two - 469 fold increase in the titer of pN - Phe ( 196 ± 23 µM final concentration of pN - Phe ) when NO16 is 470 used as catalyst ( Fig . 6A ) . 471 25 Table 1 .

ObaC was tested without a 474 hexahistidine tag . 475 476 477 478 N - oxygenase pN - Phe Titer ( µM ) ObaC 45 ± 19 NO6 , NO13 , NO18 , NO20 No protein detected NO1 - 5 , NO7 - 12 , NO14 , NO15 , NO17 , NO19 , NO21 No product detected NO16 105 ± 39 26 479 Figure 6 . Evaluation of the N - oxygenase NO16 in the synthesis of pN - Phe . ( A ) In vitro 480 investigation of NO16 activity on pA - Phe and pA - Pyr . ( B ) Media comparison of the pN - Phe and 481 pA - Phe titers using the NST ( DE3 ) ΔpheA strain of E . coli transformed with either pCola - papABC - 482 AroG * - ObaC ( strain NB16 ) or pCola - papABC - AroG * - NO16 ( strain NB39 ) in either M9 - glucose , 483 MOPS - EZ rich - glucose , or LBL - glucose media . 484 27 Then , we sought to compare the performance of NO16 and ObaC within our de novo 485 biosynthesis pathway for pN - Phe . To start , we cloned an additional pN - Phe synthesis vector with 486 NO16 in place of ObaC in the operon with aroG * . We then evaluated the 24 h titer in M9 - glucose 487 minimal media of the pCola - papABC - AroG * - NO16 construct in the NST37 ( DE3 ) Δ pheA strain 488 in comparison to the NST37 ( DE3 ) Δ pheA strain expressing the pCola - papABC - AroG * - ObaC 489 plasmid . Here , we saw enhanced pN - Phe titer in the strain expressing NO16 ( 330 ± 75 µM ) as 490 compared to the strain expressing ObaC ( 197 ± 25 µM ) ( Fig . 6B ) . 491 With this new N - oxygenase in hand , we finally evaluated the pN - Phe titer observed at 24 h 492 that we could obtain in richer growth media at shake flask scale . Using MOPS EZ rich glucose 493 defined media , we saw the highest pN - Phe titers of 820 ± 130 µM when using NO16 in the pCola 494 vector compared to 435 ± 23 µM when using ObaC ( Fig . 6B ) . In richer LBL - glucose media , we 495 saw lower titers of pN - Phe titers when using NO16 ( 492 ± 68 µM ) and comparable titers to MOPS 496 EZ rich when using ObaC ( 456 ± 40 µM ) . The better performance of the rich - defined media using 497 NO16 was additionally achieved with a lower final cell density of approximately half that of LBL 498 media . 499 4 . Conclusion 500 This work is the first to demonstrate de novo biosynthesis of a non - naturally occurring nsAA . 501 In addition , prior to this work N - oxygenases had not been harnessed in biosynthetic pathways for 502 novel nitro - product biosynthesis . The potential to safely synthesize nitroaromatic compounds from 503 renewable feedstocks is valuable , and further studies into nitroaromatic biosynthesis using N - 504 oxygenases are warranted . Here , we demonstrated the biosynthesis of the nitroaromatic amino acid 505 pN - Phe in titers of 330 ± 75 µM pN - Phe from M9 - minimal media and 820 ± 130 µM from a 506 MOPS - EZ rich defined media , with pN - Phe representing the dominant heterologous metabolite . 507 28 Utilization of this pathway with methods of genetic code expansion could enable the use of pN - 508 Phe within proteins for in situ applications and further broaden its potential use case . 509 510 5 .
