While in recent years our understanding of actin assembly mechanisms has grown immensely , our knowledge of actin disassembly machinery and mechanisms has remained comparatively sparse . Saccharomyces cerevi - siae is an ideal system to tackle this problem , both because of its amenabilities to genetic manipulation and live - cell imaging and because only a single gene encodes each of the core disassembly factors : coﬁlin ( COF1 ) , Srv2 / CAP ( SRV2 ) , Aip1 ( AIP1 ) , GMF ( GMF1 / AIM7 ) , coronin ( CRN1 ) , and twinﬁlin ( TWF1 ) . Among these six factors , only the functions of coﬁlin are essen - tial and have been well deﬁned . Here , we investigated the functions of the nonessential actin disassembly fac - tors by performing genetic and live - cell imaging analy - ses on a combinatorial set of isogenic single , double , triple , and quadruple mutants in S . cerevisiae . Our results show that each disassembly factor makes an important contribution to cell viability , actin organiza - tion , and endocytosis . Further , our data reveal new rela - tionships among these factors , providing insights into how they work together to orchestrate actin turnover . Finally , we observe speciﬁc combinations of mutations that are lethal , e . g . , srv2 D aip1 D and srv2 D crn1 D twf1 D , demonstrating that while coﬁlin is essential , it is not sufﬁcient in vivo , and that combinations of the other disassembly factors perform vital functions .

Many of these actin net - works must undergo highly dynamic remodeling , which is achieved through coordinated actin assembly and disassem - bly mechanisms . In recent years , a relatively clear mechanis - tic picture has emerged for how ﬁlamentous actin arrays are assembled in cells , involving collaborations and interplay among various actin nucleation and elongation factors [ Chesarone and Goode , 2009 ; Dominguez , 2009 ; Blan - choin and Michelot , 2012 ; Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ] . Com - paratively less is known about the cellular machinery and mechanisms driving the rapid disassembly of actin ﬁlament arrays . A set of six ubiquitous proteins ( ADF / coﬁlin , Srv2 / CAP , Aip1 , GMF , coronin , and twinﬁlin ) has emerged as a core set of actin disassembly machinery found in organisms as diverse as yeast and mammals ( Ono , 2007 ; Poukkula et al . , 2011 ; Brieher , 2013 ; Ono , 2013 ) . However , among these six factors , only the functions and mechanisms of ADF / coﬁlin ( referred to as coﬁlin hereafter ) are well deﬁned , and the roles of the other proteins and how they work in concert to disassemble actin networks are still not well understood . Coﬁlin has been the focus of intense biochemical investi - gation for over 30 years [ Harris and Weeds , 1983 ; Mabu - chi , 1983 ; Nishida et al . , 1984 ; Nishida et al . , 1985 ; Cooper et al . , 1986 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1988 ; Andrianantoan - dro and Pollard , 2006 ; Suarez et al . , 2011 ] . Coﬁlin binds cooperatively to the sides of ﬁlaments and severs them , cre - ating new ends to accelerate either assembly or disassembly , depending on conditions ( e . g . , monomer concentration and efﬁciency of barbed end capping ) [ Cooper et al . , 1986 ; Bravo - Cordero et al . , 2013 ] . More recently , Srv2 / CAP , Aip1 , coronin , GMF , and twinﬁlin have each been Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online ver - sion of this article .

Cytoskeleton Published by Wiley Periodicals , Inc . 349 (cid:2) implicated in the actin disassembly process via genetic and / or biochemical observations . Srv2 / CAP has two separate functions , one in enhancing coﬁlin - mediated severing of ﬁl - aments [ Normoyle and Brieher , 2012 ; Chaudhry et al . , 2013 ; Zhang et al . , 2013 ] and one in recycling coﬁlin and ADP - actin monomers [ Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ; Balcer et al . , 2003 ; Mattila et al . , 2004 ; Chaudhry et al . , 2014 ; Jansen et al . , 2014 ] . Aip1 promotes coﬁlin - mediated actin ﬁlament disassembly both by enhancing severing and by capping newly generated barbed ends [ Okada et al . , 1999 ; Rodal et al . , 1999 ; Okada et al . , 2002 ; Balcer et al . , 2003 ; Ono et al . , 2004 ; Brieher et al . , 2006 ; Okada et al . , 2006 ; Kueh et al . , 2008 ; Nadkarni and Brieher , 2014 ; Gressin et al . , 2015 ; Jansen et al . , 2015 ] . Coronin works together with coﬁlin and Aip1 to promote disassembly even under assembly conditions , by accelerating coﬁlin recruitment to ﬁla - ment sides and enhancing severing and capping [ Brieher et al . , 2006 ; Cai et al . , 2007a ; Gandhi et al . , 2009 ] . GMF is an ADF - homology ( ADFH ) domain protein that binds Arp2 / 3 complex and catalyzes ﬁlament debranching [ Gandhi et al . , 2010b ; Luan and Nolen , 2013 ; Ydenberg et al . , 2013 ; Poukkula et al . , 2014 ; Haynes et al . , 2015 ] . Twinﬁlin consists of ADFH domains connected by a short linker , and although it has been primarily described as an actin monomer sequestering protein [ Goode et al . , 1998 ; Ojala et al . , 2002 ] , genetic interactions with coﬁlin in yeast and ﬂies implicate twinﬁlin in promoting actin disassembly [ Goode et al . , 1998 ; Wahlstrom et al . , 2001 ] . A major challenge now is to gain a deeper understanding of the individual and combined functions of these six disas - sembly factors , by investigating their physical interactions , biochemical activities , loss - of - function phenotypes , and genetic relationships . However , these goals have been ham - pered by the complexity of analyzing whole sets of proteins or genes . Here , we focus on improving our understanding of the genetic interactions and shared in vivo functions of the less - studied core actin disassembly factors in Saccharo - myces cerevisiae . Budding yeast provides an attractive model system for this analysis because of the low complexity of its genome , e . g . , mammals have three coﬁlin genes , seven coro - nin genes , two twinﬁlin genes , two Srv2 / CAP genes , and two GMF genes , whereas S . cerevisiae has only a single gene encoding each of these factors [ Morgan and Fernandez , 2008 ; Poukkula et al . , 2011 ] . In addition , yeast readily ena - bles the simultaneous disruption of multiple genes and the analysis of their effects on the actin cytoskeleton . Yeast cells contain three prominent F - actin structures : cortical patches , which are sites of endocytosis ; cables , which are tracks for myosin - based transport of vesicles and organelles required for polarized cell growth ; and cytoki - netic rings , which facilitate cell division [ Adams and Prin - gle , 1984 ; Moseley and Goode , 2006 ; Mishra et al . , 2014 ] . Each of these F - actin structures is highly dynamic , with patches and cables turning over in 10 – 20 s . Regulated disas - sembly plays a vital role in vivo , as demonstrated by the lethality caused by deleting the yeast coﬁlin gene ( COF1 ) [ Moon et al . , 1993 ] . Somewhat perplexingly though , dele - tions of other genes in the disassembly ensemble have little if any effect on yeast cell growth on their own , e . g . , crn1 D , aip1 D , twf1 D , and gmf1 D , yet these mutations each can strongly exacerbate the temperature sensitivity of cof1 par - tial loss - of - function alleles , and in some cases cause lethality [ Goode et al . , 1998 ; Goode et al . , 1999 ; Rodal et al . , 1999 ; Gandhi et al . , 2010b ] . Together , these observations suggest that more information is needed to understand their roles and contributions . Importantly , these mutations have never been analyzed side - by - side with an isogenic strain set , or in combination sets beyond simple pairs . Here , we performed a systematic analysis for the ﬁrst time of single , double , tri - ple , and quadruple mutant strains , analyzing them by ﬁxed and live - cell imaging for defects in cell growth , actin orga - nization , and endocytosis . Results Shared Essential Functions Among Actin Disassembly Genes We ﬁrst generated a large set of single , double , triple , and quadruple mutant strains combining null mutations in AIP1 , CRN1 , GMF1 , SRV2 , and TWF1 ( details of strain construction in Supporting Information , Table S1 ) . Because some of these proteins have been proposed to work at least in part by capping severed ends of ﬁlaments , we also included a null mutation in CAP2 , which encodes one of the two subunits of yeast capping protein ( note that cap2 D abolishes capping protein function [ Kim et al . , 2004 ] ) . We also note that it was not possible to create strains with cer - tain combinations of mutations due to synthetic lethality ( Fig . 1 , red boxes ) . This analysis conﬁrmed previously reported synthetic lethal interactions between srv2 D and aip1 D and synthetic slow - growth interactions between aip1 D and cap2 D [ Balcer et al . , 2003 ; Michelot et al . , 2013 ] . Importantly , the further deletion of CRN1 in the aip1 D cap2 D background resulted in lethality , consistent with the view that Aip1 and coronin function together in capping ﬁlaments after severing [ Brieher et al . , 2006 ; Kueh et al . , 2008 ; Ishikawa - Ankerhold et al . , 2010 ; Jansen et al . , 2015 ] . The crn1 D srv2 D twf1 D triple mutant was also lethal , revealing another important essential function shared among a speciﬁc set of disassembly factors . For all the viable mutant strains , we measured doubling times during logarithmic growth phase in rich medium at 25 , 30 , 34 , and 37 8 C . We used these data to determine the speciﬁc effect of deleting each gene in a strain already con - taining zero , one , two , or three deletions in other disassem - bly factors ( Fig . 1 and Supporting Information , Table S2 ) . We expressed the results as the minimum temperature at which at least a twofold change in the doubling time was observed relative to the parent strain . Among the single mutants , srv2 D had a strong effect on growth at multiple (cid:2) 350 Ydenberg et al . CYTOSKELETON temperatures , cap2 D affected growth only at elevated tem - peratures , and aip1 D , gmf1 D , and twf1 D each grew as well as wild type at all temperatures . On the other hand , crn1 D single mutants caused a slight growth defect at 37 8 C , which was not previously observed [ Heil - Chapdelaine et al . , 1998 ; Goode et al . , 1999 ; Gandhi et al . , 2010a ] , suggesting that our quantitative growth assays may be more sensitive than comparing growth on plates . In the context of strains already lacking one or more dis - assembly components , stronger defects were apparent after deleting additional genes . In particular , lethality or strong growth defects were observed when srv2 D was combined Fig . 1 . Growth defects due to loss of actin disassembly genes . Growth curves of yeast strains were performed in quadruplicate in 96 - well plates grown in YPD medium . The data show the effect that each deletion ( indicated along the top axis ) has when added to the mutation ( s ) indicated along the left axis . Raw growth rates and strain numbers are shown in Supporting Information , Table S2 . In the heat map , a defect indicated at a given temperature was considered to have occurred if the doubling time was increased by at least twofold . Synthetic lethality , indicated in red , was determined from tetrad analysis . CYTOSKELETON Genetic Analysis of Actin Disassembly Factors 351 (cid:2) with other disassembly mutants . For analysis of mutations not involving srv2 D , a number of speciﬁc combinations led to clear growth defects , including aip1 D cap2 D and gmf1 D crn1 D . This suggests that the process of actin disassembly involves multiple factors with unique , yet partially redun - dant functions . It also demonstrates that the severing activ - ity of Cof1 is not the only activity among this group of proteins required for viability . Instead , it is apparent that there are speciﬁc combinations of activities among the remaining components that are essential and additional combinations that are required for normal growth . Contributions of Aip1 , Crn1 , Gmf1 , and Twf1 in Regulating Endocytic Patch Dynamics In yeast , branched actin ﬁlament arrays are assembled at sites of endocytosis and play an essential role in driving invagination and scission of vesicles at the cell cortex [ Kak - sonen et al . , 2003 ; Idrissi et al . , 2012 ; Kukulski et al . , 2012 ] . Live - cell imaging studies have deﬁned a system of > 60 proteins recruited to patches in a deﬁned temporal order to orchestrate this process [ Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ; Galletta et al . , 2010 ; Boettner et al . , 2012 ] . Actin and actin - associated proteins are among the last proteins to arrive , and in wild - type cells , the duration of this “late actin phase” is only 15 – 20 s before vesicles are internalized [ Kak - sonen et al . , 2003 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ] . Previous studies have shown that crn1 D , aip1 D and cof1 alleles each individ - ually extend the lifetime of the actin phase [ Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ; Lin et al . , 2010 ; Okreglak and Drubin , 2010 ; Liu et al . , 2011 ] , although the effects of aip1 D and crn1 D were modest , whereas srv2 D and twf1 D do not strongly affect patch dynamics [ Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ] , and gmf1 D effects are unexplored . To monitor the kinetics of the actin phase , we used a dual - color imaging system in strains carrying different com - binations of deletions in AIP1 , CRN1 , TWF1 , and GMF1 ( Fig . 2A and B , and Supporting Information , Movie S1 ) . Because GFP tags on actin itself interfere with function , we used Arc15 - GFP ( ARPC5 ) , the smallest subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex as a proxy , given that it is an integral com - ponent of branched F - actin networks . This tagged protein is fully functional , and shows the same kinetic behavior as the commonly used Abp1 - GFP marker [ Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ] . As reported previously for Abp1 - GFP [ Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ; Lin et al . , 2010 ] , we found that the hypomorphic cof1 - 22 allele extended the patch lifetime of Arc15 - GFP ( Fig . 2C ) , showing that compromised actin turnover extends the patch lifetime . We also included Cof1 - mRFP in our analysis because we were interested in the kinetics of disassembly . In wild type cells , this marker arrives at patches shortly after the ﬁrst appearance of actin and Arp2 / 3 complex , and persists there while vesicles are internalized [ Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ; Lin et al . , 2010 ] . Cof1 - mRFP is an internal in - frame tag and complements much though not all of COF1 function , as demonstrated by Lin et al . [ 2010 ] ; it is reported to be the most functional tag available for Cof1 , and we used it only in strains that also contain endogenous COF1 . In wild type cells , we observed Arc15 - GFP and Cof1 - mRFP lifetimes similar to those previously reported , and the behavior of each tag was not signiﬁcantly affected by the presence of the other ( Fig . 2D ) . Cof1 - mRFP arrived at patches shortly after actin ( marked by Arc15 - GFP ) , and persisted there for the life - time of the patches at the cortex ( Fig . 2B ) . Both markers were internalized and could sometimes be observed inside the cell in the same focal plane brieﬂy before disappearing . The average lifetime of Arc15 - GFP in wild - type cells was 24 . 8 6 6 . 6 s ( mean 6 SD ; Fig . 2D ; Supporting Informa - tion , Table S3 ) , and did not change substantially in any of the single mutants ( aip1 D 5 31 . 0 6 9 . 0 s ; crn1 D 5 30 . 7 6 10 . 5 s ; gmf1 D 5 27 . 8 6 8 . 8 s ; twf1 D 5 29 . 4 6 8 . 6 s ) . However , the lifetimes became successively longer in double and triple mutants , and were longest in the quadru - ple aip1 D crn1 D gmf1 D twf1 D mutant , with a mean life - time 68 . 7 6 30 . 9 s . Notably , this is even longer than the actin lifetime in cof1 - 22 mutants ( Fig . 2C ) . To identify activities that may be impacted by the pro - gressive loss of speciﬁc sets of disassembly factors , for each pair of genes , we compared the actin phase lifetimes of the individual single mutants with the double mutants . If each gene makes a separate contribution to extending patch life - time , then the extension of lifetime in the double mutant ( compared to wild type ) should be close to the sum of the lifetime extensions of the two single mutants . To accom - plish this , we performed a z - test , comparing this hypotheti - cal , additive , double mutant to the real double mutant lifetime population ( Table I ) . Two double mutants ( aip1 D crn1 D and crn1 D twf1 D ) were more severely impaired than expected for the sum of their individual defects , suggesting that these pairs of proteins may have more closely related functions in disassembly . Loss of Disassembly Factors Alters Cof1 Dynamics at Endocytic Patches We next considered how deletions in the core disassembly factors affected the expression levels of endogenous Cof1 and / or the dynamics at actin patches of Cof1 - mRFP ( expressed from a plasmid in these strains ) . Quantitative western blotting showed that all of our strains had wild - type levels of endogenous Cof1 ( Fig . 3A ) . Cof1 - mRFP life - times increased progressively after deletion of the other disassembly components , ranging from 21 . 5 6 8 . 9 s in wild type cells to 58 . 2 6 31 . 3 s in aip1 D crn1 D gmf1 D twf1 D cells ( Fig . 3B ) . This trend paralleled the increase in actin / Arc15 - GFP lifetimes in the same mutant strains , and indeed , there was a tight correlation between mean Arc15 - (cid:2) 352 Ydenberg et al .

Results are also listed in Supporting Information , Table S3 . GFP lifetimes and Cof1 - mRFP lifetimes in the 16 strains ( Fig . 3C ; R 2 5 0 . 91 ) . We also examined how these mutations affected the length of the earliest part of the actin phase when the actin network is being rapidly formed by Arp2 / 3 complex but the disassembly factors have not yet arrived [ Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ; Lin et al . , 2010 ] . The delay between arrival of Arc15 - GFP and Cof1 - mRFP increased from 5 . 2 6 4 . 2 s in wild type cells to 8 . 6 6 7 . 3 s in aip1 D crn1 D gmf1 D twf1 D cells , and again correlated with extended actin life - times ( Fig . 3C ; R 2 5 0 . 33 ) . These data show that loss of some disassembly factors can extend the “actin assembly phase , ” possibly due to reduced replenishment of the actin monomer pool , and / or delay the arrival of other disassem - bly factors such as coﬁlin . We also examined Cof1 - mRFP kinetics at patches by comparing the timeline proﬁles for average intensity of Arc15 - GFP and Cof1 - mRFP between wild - type and mutant cells . This was achieved by aligning all of the pro - ﬁles for a given strain , starting from the ﬁrst appearance of Arc15 - GFP , and calculating the average intensity of Arc15 - GFP and Cof1 - mRFP at each time point ( Fig . 3D ) . Two major differences between wild type and mutants became evident . First , Arc15 - GFP signal accumulated more rapidly and peaked by 10 s in wild type cells , but not until almost 20 s in aip1 D crn1 D gmf1 D twf1 D cells . Second , in wild - type cells , Cof1 - mRFP peaked by about 12 s and remained high even as Arc15 - GFP eventually declined , whereas in mutant cells Arc15 - GFP and Cof1 - mRFP signals declined in parallel . Put another way , in wild - type cells , the ratio of Arc15 - GFP to Cof1 - mRFP changed drastically during patch maturation , as previously reported ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ; Lin et al . , 2010 ) , suggesting that as patches mature , more and more Cof1 accumulates relative to the amount of F - actin remaining . In contrast , in the severe dis - assembly mutants , the ratio of Cof1 - mRFP to Arc15 - GFP remained more constant . Thus , one important function of the other disassembly proteins may be to facilitate the steady enrichment of Cof1 on actin patches . Actin Organization Defects and Aberrant Cof1 Decoration of Actin Cables in Disassembly Mutants Disassembly mutants such as srv2 D and cof1 - 22 have been shown to cause strong morphological and polarization defects , including enlarged cell size , depolarized actin patches , and diminished actin cable staining [ Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Balcer et al . , 2003 ] . To test whether such defects were also present in the mutant strains gener - ated here , we ﬁxed and stained cells with rhodamine – phal - loidin ( Fig . 4A ) . Quadruple mutants had severely depolarized actin cytoskeletons , exhibiting many of the same defects described for srv2 D and cof1 - 22 cells , includ - ing large cell size , “brighter” and depolarized actin patches , and strongly reduced cable staining ( Fig . 4B ) . Partial defects were apparent in each of the four single mutants , and were progressively more severe in combinatorial mutants . Thus , individual single mutants each cause minor defects in actin organization that may have been overlooked in previous studies . Furthermore , the extent of depolarization in the quadruple mutant was greater than in cof1 - 22 ( Fig . 4B ) . Cof1 has been observed to accumulate on actin cables in aip1 D cells , but not on cables in wild - type cells [ Rodal et al . , 1999 ; Okada et al . , 2006 ; Lin et al . , 2010 ] . Consist - ent with these observations , we observed Cof1 - mRFP cable - like staining in all double , triple , and quadruple strains that included aip1 D , but no mutants that were AIP1 1 ( Fig . 4C and D , and Supporting Information , Movie S2 ) . Further , time lapse imaging revealed that Cof1 - mRFP - decorated cables in aip1 D cells persisted for an aver - age of 58 . 8 6 40 . 8 s . While it is not possible to directly compare lifetimes of Cof1 - mRFP decoration in wild - type cells , estimates for cable turnover rates based on extension rates and lengths are 5 – 10 s [ Yu et al . , 2011 ] . In aip1 D crn1 D gmf1 D twf1 D cells , lifetimes of Cof1 - mRFP - decorated cables were similar to aip1 D single mutants ( 57 . 3 6 21 . 9 s ) , reinforcing the view that these defects arise from the loss of AIP1 . Together , these observations demon - strate that aip1 D leads to formation of stabilized cables abnormally decorated with Cof1 , which is consistent with recent in vitro observations showing that Aip1 prevents coﬁlin from overdecorating and hyperstabilizing ﬁlaments Table I .

Expected lifetime was calculated using the equation : ( muta - nt1 2 WT ) 1 ( mutant2 2 WT ) 1 WT 5 mutant1 1 mutant2 2 WT , which assumes that each individual mutation independently adds a discrete amount of patch lifetime to the base WT lifetime . For exam - ple , aip1 D adds 31 . 0 2 24 . 8 5 6 . 2 s to WT , crn1 D adds 30 . 7 2 24 . 8 5 5 . 9 s , and the double mutant would be expected to add the sum of these to the WT lifetime ( 24 . 8 1 6 . 2 1 5 . 9 5 36 . 9 s ) . The p - value was determined by a z - test between the double mutant popula - tion and the expected value . (cid:2) 354 Ydenberg et al . CYTOSKELETON Fig . 3 .

In a separate experiment , WT ( DDY904 ) and cof1 - 22 ( PLY29 ) were compared ( n (cid:2) 98 cells each ) .

Example images of Cof1 - mRFP in WT ( CY259 ) and aip1 ( CY262 ) strains ( C ) , with yellow arrowhead pointing to a cable - like , Cof1 - mRFP - decorated structure . The percentage of cells with such structures was scored in the indicated strains ( D ) , and was found to correlate closely with the loss of AIP1 . Strains are the same as in Fig . 2 . [ Nadkarni and Brieher , 2014 ; Gressin et al . , 2015 ; Jansen et al . , 2015 ] . Discussion Many of the most important functions performed by cellu - lar actin structures depend on the ﬁlaments comprising these networks being assembled and disassembled on very short timescales . How such rapid actin ﬁlament turnover dynamics are achieved is only beginning to be understood , but appears to involve the ﬁlament severing protein coﬁlin working in concert with a core set of actin disassembly cofactors that includes Srv2 / CAP , Aip1 , coronin , GMF , and twinﬁlin . While recent studies have begun to deﬁne how each of these proteins functions biochemically , our under - standing of how they work together in vivo to drive rapid actin turnover has been hampered in part by limited genetic analysis on the network . Studies in a variety of systems have begun to tackle this problem by analyzing the effects of dis - rupting pairs of disassembly factors [ Ishikawa - Ankerhold et al . , 2010 ; Lin et al . , 2010 ; Berro and Pollard , 2014 ; Poukkula et al . , 2014 ; Talman et al . , 2014 ] . Here , we lever - aged the genetic amenability of S . cerevisiae to more exten - sively and combinatorially analyze single , double , triple , and quadruple mutations of disassembly factors for their effects on cell growth , actin cytoskeleton organization , and dynamics of endocytosis . Overall , our results demonstrate that each disassembly factor makes a unique contribution to these processes in vivo . Further , our data provide new insights into genetic relationships among disassembly fac - tors and deﬁne speciﬁc combinations that are essential for viability , as discussed below . Genetic interactions between aip1 D and cap2 D have been reported [ Balcer et al . , 2003 ; Michelot et al . , 2013 ; Berro and Pollard , 2014 ] , and we observed similar growth defects for aip1 D cap2 D mutants . These observations agree well with biochemical studies showing that Aip1 caps the barbed ends of ﬁlaments severed by coﬁlin [ Okada et al . , 2002 ; Balcer et al . , 2003 ; Jansen et al . , 2015 ] . Further , we observed that aip1 D crn1 D double mutants have a synthetic defect in Arc15 - GFP patch lifetime ( Table I ) , and that aip1 D cap2 D crn1 D triple mutants are lethal . Together , these results point to a role for coronin in capping ﬁlament ends in vivo , which agrees with recent single molecule anal - yses in vitro [ Jansen et al . , 2015 ] . This is also consistent with studies showing that coﬁlin , Aip1 , and coronin work together biochemically to rapidly disassemble actin ﬁla - ments even under assembly - promoting conditions [ Brieher et al . , 2006 ; Kueh et al . , 2008 ] , and with genetic studies from other organisms showing that simultaneously disrupt - ing Aip1 and coronin leads to synthetic defects in actin - based processes [ Ishikawa - Ankerhold et al . , 2010 ; Lin et al . , 2010 ; Talman et al . , 2014 ] . We also observed that crn1 D twf1 D srv2 D triple mutants are lethal , and that crn1 D twf1 D double mutants had syn - thetic defects in cell growth and Arc15 - GFP patch lifetime . Since the mechanistic role of twinﬁlin in actin disassembly is unclear , why this particular combination of three mutants ( crn1 D , twf1 D , and srv2 D ) is lethal cannot yet be explained , but should inspire future biochemical analysis of the indi - vidual and combined effects of these proteins on actin disassembly . Gmf1 showed the weakest phenotype of the disassembly factors . It tended to cause clear defects only when multiple other components were already missing . However , one exception to this trend was the crn1 D gmf1 D double mutant , which grew worse than the already compromised crn1 D strain . GMF and coronin each promote actin ﬁla - ment debranching , inhibit actin nucleation by Arp2 / 3 com - plex [ Humphries et al . , 2002 ; Cai et al . , 2008 ; Nakano et al . , 2010 ; Gandhi et al . , 2010b ; Haynes et al . , 2015 ] , and stabilize the open ( inactive ) conformation of Arp2 / 3 complex [ Rodal et al . , 2005 ; Ydenberg et al . , 2013 ] . Thus , GMF and coronin may have coordinated effects on Arp2 / 3 complex , which together are required for robust turnover of branched actin ﬁlament networks . Our data show that the most sensitive readout of impaired actin disassembly in vivo is cell polarization , and indeed the only clear defect observed in all of our single mutants was a partial depolarization of actin cables and patches . Polarized cable formation depends on the ongoing recruitment of formins at the bud cortex , and the polarity factors that recruit and activate formins at the bud tip are themselves dynamically maintained at this position through targeted delivery on cables to counteract dispersion by actin - dependent endocytosis [ Irazoqui et al . , 2005 ; Burston et al . , 2009 ] . Given this sensitive requirement for two of the major actin systems ( patches and cables ) , perhaps it not surprising that small alterations in actin turnover dynamics can disrupt polarity . On the other hand , the same single mutations cause only very subtle defects in endocytosis , as measured by patch lifetime analysis . We consider three pos - sibilities for this apparent paradox . First , actin coats remain associated with endocytic vesicles after scission and inward movement , and coat disassembly may be a crucial step in downstream events of the endocytic pathway , as previously hypothesized in studies on cof1 hypomorphic alleles [ Okre - glak and Drubin , 2007 ] . Second , small differences in endo - cytic efﬁciency may add up , leading to larger defects in polarity . Third , the rate of disassembly of actin cables may be more sensitive than that of patches to deletions in some of the disassembly factors . Indeed , cof1 - 22 , crn1 D , and aip1 D single mutants each cause more severe defects in actin cable turnover than actin patch turnover [ Okada et al . , 2006 ; Gandhi et al . , 2009 ] . Finally , we note that many of our mutants prolonged not only the later stages of endocytic patch kinetics when disas - sembly factors are present on the patch , but also the earlier assembly phase ( Fig . 3 ) . One likely explanation for the pro - longed assembly phase is that loss of disassembly factors CYTOSKELETON Genetic Analysis of Actin Disassembly Factors 357 (cid:2) decreases the rate of actin monomer recycling , thus slowing new assembly . Indeed , cof1 hypomorphic alleles reduce the rate of in vivo actin ﬁlament treadmilling , presumably because impaired disassembly reduces the monomer pool and impedes new polymerization [ Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ] . Another possibility is that the delay between onset of actin assembly and arrival of coﬁlin results from an absence of disassembly cofactors that normally help recruit coﬁlin to patches , e . g . , coronin [ Jansen et al . , 2015 ] . In summary , our results demonstrate that each disassem - bly factor makes a unique genetic contribution to actin turnover in vivo , and given their conservation suggests that this network of proteins has been optimized and main - tained across evolution , from yeast to humans . The impor - tance of these same proteins in multicellular organisms is demonstrated by the requirement for Aip1 , CAP1 , coronin , GMF , and twinﬁlin in maintaining proper lamellipodial dynamics [ Rogers et al . , 2003 ; Bertling et al . , 2004 ; Cai et al . , 2007b ; Iwasa and Mullins , 2007 ; Aerbajinai et al . , 2011 ; Poukkula et al . , 2014 ; Haynes et al . , 2015 ] , and the requirement for many of these same disassembly factors in intercell spreading of Listeria [ Talman et al . , 2014 ] . In addi - tion , our data show unequivocally that coﬁlin is not sufﬁ - cient to support rates of disassembly required for viability , because speciﬁc combinations of the other disassembly fac - tors are lethal . Overall , this paints a new picture of the reg - ulation of actin disassembly , in which at least six conserved proteins work in concert as components of an integrated network promoting rapid and efﬁcient ﬁlament disassembly . Materials and Methods Yeast Media , Strains , and Plasmids Yeast strains along with a brief description of their construc - tion methods are provided in Supporting Information , Table S1 . Yeast media and transformation procedures were performed as described in Adams et al . [ 1997 ] . The srv2 D : : HIS3 , cap2 D : : HIS3 , crn1 D : : NatMX6 and twf1 D : : HIS3 knockout constructs were created by the Longtine method [ Longtine et al . , 1998 ] . The aip1 D : : URA3 knockout construct was made by amplifying the AIP1 locus containing the disruption from DBY6527 and introducing this mutation into our wild - type strain [ Amberg et al . , 1995 ] . The crn1 : : LEU2 knockout construct was made similarly by amplifying the CRN1 locus contain - ing the disruption from DDY1518 [ Goode et al . , 1999 ] . The gmf1 D : : kanMX6 knockout construct was made by amplifying the GMF1 / AIM7 locus containing the disrup - tion from BGY3090 [ Gandhi et al . , 2010b ] . Knockouts were conﬁrmed by PCR across the affected region , and comparing the sizes of the resulting products with controls . In the case of aip1 D : : URA3 , the PCR product was digested with NcoI to distinguish wild - type and mutant products . Swapping of crn1 : : LEU2 with crn1 D : : NatMX6 was con - ﬁrmed by ensuring the resulting strain was Leu2 2 . Growth Analysis Growth curves were performed in a multi - well plate reader ( Tecan , San Jose , CA ) as described in Ydenberg et al . [ 2013 ] . Doubling time was measured in the logarithmic phase of growth , and was averaged between replicate wells . Experiments were performed separately at four different temperatures ( 25 , 30 , 34 , and 37 8 C ) . A table of growth rate ratios and a heat map of the temperature needed to see a twofold increase in doubling time were prepared using a Python script , provided at https : / / github . com / CAYdenberg / Actin - disassembly – yeast - growth - rate - analysis . Live - Cell Imaging All images were acquired using an upright microscope ( Ni - E ; Nikon ) equipped with a spinning disc head ( CSU - W1 ; Yokugawa Corporation of America ) , a 100 3 NA 1 . 45 Plan Apochromat objective , and an electron multiplying charge - coupled device camera ( iXon 897U ; Andor Technology ) . Actin patch dynamics were monitored by live imaging using cells grown to log phase in synthetic medium and immobilized on 2 % agarose in synthetic medium . Images were acquired with laser excitation at 488 and 561 nm for 100 ms each , every 0 . 5 s . Kymographs representing single endocytic events were selected , and line proﬁles along each kymograph were exported as text ﬁles . Images were proc - essed using Elements AR and ImageJ . Using NIS Elements , kymographs representing single patches that were well iso - lated in time and space were selected and cropped , and a line proﬁle was drawn along the length of the kymograph . To avoid pseudoreplication , only one patch per cell was selected . A text ﬁle representing the raw intensity in both channels was exported from NIS Elements . These text ﬁles were collected and parsed using code available at https : / / github . com / CAYdenberg / Actin - disassembly – endocytic - patch - lifetime - analysis . Wild - type and mutant cells carrying an inte - grated Arc15 - GFP were transformed with a low - copy plasmid expressing Cof1 - mRFP ( in frame insertion of mRFP as described in Lin et al . [ 2010 ] ) . Analysis of strains contain - ing Cof1 - mRFP without Arc15 - GFP revealed a bleed - through for mRFP together with our ﬁlter sets . The amount of bleed - through could be described by the equation y 5 0 . 2564 x 1 154 . 24 , where x is the intensity of the 561 nm ( mRFP ) channel and y is the intensity of the 488 nm ( GFP ) channel . After subtracting y from the raw intensities in the 488 nm channel , a background value was calculated by aver - aging the ﬁrst ﬁve and last ﬁve data points in each channel , and assuming that the background changed linearly between them ( due to photobleaching ) . After subtracting background , all values were normalized to the maximum intensity in the 488 nm channel . These corrected intensity proﬁles were used to determine the longest streak of positive values in the 488 (cid:2) 358 Ydenberg et al . CYTOSKELETON and 561 nm channels , which were taken to be the lifetimes of Arc15 - GFP and Cof1 - mRFP , respectively . The difference between the beginning of the GFP and mRFP streaks was taken as the delay between Arc15 - GFP and Cof1 - mRFP asso - ciation ( this was allowed to be negative ) . However , some patches contained very low mRFP signal , presumably due to plasmid loss . Cells in which the maximum corrected mRFP intensity was not at least three times the greatest negative value in this channel were excluded from analysis of coﬁlin lifetime and delay . For alignment and averaging , the corrected proﬁles were aligned based on the beginning of the Arc15 - GFP streak , determined above , and the average intensity at each time point was determined for all proﬁles for each strain . Cof1 - mRFP proﬁles were left out of the averaging if they con - tained low signal , as above . Proﬁles were included in the averaging until the GFP streak ended ; after that , they were not included . The average proﬁle was stopped after two or fewer individual proﬁles remained . Western Blotting Protein extracts were prepared as described in Adams et al . [ 1997 ] , from (cid:3) 3 . 0 3 10 7 cells . Proteins were resolved on 15 % SDS - PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose . Blot - ting was performed with chicken a Cof1 [ Okada et al . , 2006 ] at 1 : 1000 , and rabbit a Tub2 [ Matsuzaki et al . , 1988 ] at 1 : 3500 . HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies were subsequently added and bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence . Band intensities were meas - ured using ImageJ . Phalloidin Staining and Scoring Images were acquired as described in Graziano et al . [ 2011 ] , except that rhodamine – phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) was used . Images of single cells were cropped out of the ﬁeld in a “blind” manner , i . e . , by a different lab member from the one who performed the acquisition . Scoring was performed by a third lab member , using CellBlind ( https : / / github . com / CAYdenberg / cellblind ) , which presents the images in a randomized order , and allows assignment of scores while blinded from the source strain and ﬁlename . Sample images were prepared for presentation purposes using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop , and were resampled when necessary to obtain publication - quality pixel density .
