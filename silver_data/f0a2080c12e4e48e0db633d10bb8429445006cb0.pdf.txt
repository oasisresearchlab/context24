Dynamin was originally identified as a microtubule - binding protein . Previous limited digestion experiment revealed that C - terminal 100 - amino acids proline rich domain ( PRD ) of dynamin is responsible for microtubule binding in vitro . However , as obvious localization of dynamin along microtubules is onlyobserved at the spindle midzone during mitosis but not in interphase cells , it remains unclear how dynamin interacts with microtubules in vivo . Here , we report that GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) , a truncated mutant lacking a C - terminal portion of the PRD , localized along microtubules in interphase HeLa cells . GFP - dynamin - 2 - wild type ( WT ) and GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 745 ) , a construct that was further truncated to remove the entire PRD , localized in discrete punctate structures but notalong microtubules . These data suggest that the N - terminal ( residues 746 – 786 ) but not the entire PRD is necessary for the interaction of dynamin - 2 with microtubules in the cell and that the C - terminus of PRD ( 787 – 870 ) negatively regulate this interaction . Microtubules in cells expressing GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) were stabilized against exposure to cold . These results provide a first evidence for a regulated interaction of dynamin - 2 with microtubules in cultured mammalian cells . © 2009 Elsevier Inc . All rights reserved . Keywords : Dynamin - 2 Microtubules Proline rich domain Introduction The microtubule cytoskeleton plays important roles during each cell cycle . Interphasic microtubules are involved in cell polarization and migration in many cell types such as fibroblasts [ 1 ] , endothelial cells [ 2 ] and the nerve growth cones [ 3 ] . On the other hand , mitotic microtubules organize the bipolar mitotic spindle and are necessary for chromosome segregation . The mitotic spindle is mainly composed of the kinetochore and astral microtubules . In anaphase cells , the kinetochore microtubules start pulling chromosomes apart and the astral microtubules exten - sively elongate . Furthermore , anti - parallel microtubules are assembled in the midzone between the separated chromosomes ( spindle midzone ) . Thus , the regulation of microtubule dynamics is a key to understanding the molecular basis of cell polarization , cell migration and cell division . Dynamins are a family of large mechanochemical GTPases , including the classical dynamins , dynamin - 1 , 2 and 3 in mamma - lian cells , and dynamin - like proteins [ 4 , 5 ] . Dynamin - 1 , a neuronal isoform of the enzyme , was originally identified as a 100 - kD nucleotide - dependent microtubule - binding protein [ 6 , 7 ] and later shown to have microtubule - stimulated GTPase activity [ 8 , 9 ] .

Herskovits et al . identified the PRD of dynamin - 1 as the binding site for microtubules , using limited digestion with papain [ 10 ] . Cdc2 kinase , an important kinase in the destruction of the interphase network of microtubules and the formation of the mitotic spindle , phosphorylates dynamin - 1 and reduces its ability to bind microtubules in vitro [ 11 ] . Earnest et al . also reported that dynamin - 1 can be phosphorylated by the MAP kinase , ERK2 , resulting in reduced affinity for microtubules and inhibition of its microtubule - activated GTPase activity [ 12 ] . Thus , evidence for the role of dynamin - 1 in microtubule function has been accumulated in vitro . However , no obvious dynamin - 1 staining has been seen associated with microtubules in mamma - lian cultured cells . Ubiquitously expressed dynamin - 2 has been shown to play an important role in endocytosis , membrane trafficking and actin regulation but not in microtubule dynamics [ 13 ] . Indeed , there is little evidence that microtubules are involved in endocytosis . Recently , dynamin was reported to associate with the spindle midzone and to be required for cytokinesis [ 14 ] ; but , it has not been shown that dynamin localizes along microtubules in interphase cells [ 4 , 15 , 16 ] . These data suggest that there might be mechanism ( s ) that differentially regulate dynamin – microtubule interactions during mitosis and interphase . We sought evidence for interactions of dynamin with micro - tubules in interphase cells by introducing GFP - tagged dynamin - 2 - mutants into HeLa cells . Our experiments revealed that GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) , a truncated mutant lacking a C - terminal portion of PRD , but not GFP - dynamin - 2 - WT or an entire PRD - deletion mutant colocalized with microtubules in interphase cells . These suggest that the N - terminus and C - terminus of the PRD regulate positively and negatively the interaction of dynamin - 2 with microtubules in interphase cells , respectively . Moreover , microtubules are more stable in cells expressing with GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) than in cells expressing GFP - dynamin - 2 - WT , indicating that the interaction of dynamin - 2 with microtubules can stabilize microtubules . Materials and methods Materials and chemicals Mouse monoclonal antibodies against α - tubulin and dynamin - 2 were purchased from GeneTex , Inc . ( San Antonio , TX , U . S .

The SalI – XbaI fragment of pcDNA3 . 1 - HA - dynamin - 2 was subcloned into pEGFP - C1 vector to generate pEGFP - C1 - dynamin - 2 - ( 351 – 870 ) . Cell culture and transfection HeLa cells ( RCB0007 ) were obtained from the Riken Cell Bank ( Tsukuba , Japan ) and cultured as described previously [ 17 ] . Transfec - tion of dynamin - 2 into HeLa cells was performed with Lipofectamine ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , U . S . A . ) according to the manufacturer ' s instruction . Immunoblotting For immunoblotting , HeLa cell lysates were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , followed by transfer to PROTORAN ® nitrocellulose membranes ( Whatman ® Schleicher & Schuell , Dassel , Germany ) . Membranes were probed with anti - dynamin polyclonal antibody ( 1 : 100 ) and anti - GFP polyclonal antibody ( 1 : 5000 ) , followed by alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1 : 5000 ) ( Promega , Madison , WT ) . The blots were then developed with 0 . 2 mg / ml Nitro blue tetrazolium ( Nacalai Tesque , Inc . , Kyoto , Japan ) and 0 . 1 mg / ml 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl phosphate ( Nacalai Tesque , Inc . , Kyoto , Japan ) . Indirect immunofluorescence Indirect immunofluorescence was carried out by the method of Murata - Hori et al [ 18 ] . Briefly , HeLa cells were fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 or 100 % acetone .

Results are representative of three independent experiments . 1339 E X P E R I M E N T A L C E L L R E S E A R C H 3 1 5 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 1 3 3 6 – 1 3 4 5 ( Olympus FV1000D , Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) . Images of GFP - dynamin - 2 mutants and α - tubulin were obtained with a Nikon ECLIPS TE300 microscope ( Nikon Instech Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) and a digital CCD camera ( ORCA , C4742 - 95 - 12 , Hamamatsu Photonics , Shizuoka , Japan ) . All images were processed with a custom - software . Disruption of microtubules in HeLa cells To disrupt microtubules , HeLa cells were treated with 1 μ g / ml or 2 μ g / ml nocodazole ( Acros Organics , Geel , Belgium ) for 30 min at 37 °C . In another experiment , HeLa cells were incubated in ice - cold media on ice for 5 and 15 min . Treated cells were subjected to indirect immunofluorescence . Results Endogenous dynamin colocalizes with microtubules during mitosis but not in interphase To compare the localization of endogenous dynamin with that of microtubules , we observed HeLa cells stained with anti - dynamin polyclonal antibody and anti - α - tubulin monoclonal antibody by using a confocal microscope ( Fig . 1 ) . The endogenous dynaminwas distributed as discrete punctate structures and did not colocalize with microtubules in interphase cells ( Fig . 1 , panel a ) . However , during cytokinesis , endogenous dynamin was strongly accumu - lated in the constricted area including midzonal microtubules of dividing cells ( Fig . 1 , panel b ) . This is consistent with a recent study reporting that dynamin colocalized with microtubules of spindle midzone and intercellular bridge near the midbody in mitotic cells [ 14 ] . These reminded us of a previous report that dynamin is a microtubule - binding protein . Together , they raise the possibility that the binding ability of dynamin to microtubules is differentially regulated during interphase and mitosis . A C - terminally truncated dynamin mutant , dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) , colocalizes with microtubules in interphase As it was suggested that the binding ability of dynamin to microtubules is differentially regulated during interphase and mitosis , we examined if dynamin is regulated not to interact with microtubules in interphase cells . To probe the binding ability of dynamin to microtubules in interphase cells , HeLa cells were transfected with various plasmids encoding N - terminally GFP - tagged rat dynamin - 2 ( GFP - dynamin - 2 ) wild - type or mutants ( Fig . 2A ) . The transfection efficiencies of these plasmids were 20 % to 70 % ( data not shown ) . The anti - GFP polyclonal antibody detected GFP - dynamin - 2mutantswiththeexpectedmolecularweight ( Fig . 2B ) . As shown in Fig . 2C , the anti - dynamin polyclonal antibody detected endogenous dynamins and GFP - dynamin - 2 mutants except GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 352 ) , which lacks the epitope recognized by this antibody . Bycomparingthebandsofexogenousdynaminwiththatof endogenous dynamin , it was revealed that the degrees of over - expression ranged from 2 to 6 times . These results indicate that GFP - dynamin - 2 mutants were expressed in HeLa cells . Next , we examined the localization of GFP - dynamin - 2 - WT or mutants in interphase cells . GFP - dynamin - 2 - WT was distributed as discrete punctate structures similar to endogenous dynamin ( Fig . 3A , panel a ) . These structures partially colocalized with structures labeled with FM4 - 64 , a fluorescent styryl membrane probe ( data not shown ) , suggesting that punctuate structures of GFP - dynamin - 2 are endocytic vesicles . Dynamin has three GTP - Fig . 3 ( continued ) . 1340 E X P E R I M E N T A L C E L L R E S E A R C H 3 1 5 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 1 3 3 6 – 1 3 4 5 binding domains [ 19 ] . Mutation of one of the GTP - binding domains ( dynamin - K44A ) reduced the GTP binding affinity and therefore impaired the GTPase activity of dynamin [ 20 ] . Moreover , this mutation inhibited the clathrin - mediated endocytosis . GFP - dyna - min - 2 - K44A , a GTP binding - defective mutant , was also found as discrete punctate structures ( Fig . 3A , panel b ) , suggesting that the GTPase activity of dynamin - 2 is not necessary to associate with endocytic vesicles . Previous studies had indicated that the PRD of dynamin is the binding site for microtubules in vitro [ 10 ] . To evaluate the role of the PRD in the distribution of dynamin , two C - terminal deletion mutants of dynamin , GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) and - ( 1 – 745 ) , were expressed into HeLa cells . Interestingly , GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) , corresponding to a partial deletion of the PRD localized in fiber - like structures that colocalized with microtubules in interphase cells ( Fig . 3A , panel c ) . The colocalization of GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) and microtubules was also observed by a confocal laser scanning microscope ( Fig . 3B ) . In contrast , GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 745 ) , which lacks the entire PRD , did not colocalize with microtubules ( Fig . 3A panel e ) , indicating that the residues 746 – 786 of dynamin - 2 constitute the binding site for microtubules . Furthermore , GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) - K44Alocalizedasdiscretepunctatestructures and did not colocalize with microtubules ( Fig . 3A , panel d ) , suggesting that GTP binding is required for interaction of dynamin - 2 with microtubules . GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 352 ) ( Fig . 3A panelf ) , - ( 351 – 870 ) ( Fig . 3Apanelg ) and - ( 351 – 786 ) ( Fig . 3Apanel h ) diffused through the cytoplasm and did not colocalized with microtubules . Based on the localization of each GFP - dynamin - 2 mutant in the cells , we classified the cells into three distinctive patterns as shown in panels a ( punctate ) , c ( filamentous ) and f ( diffused ) of Fig . 3A ( Fig . 3C ) . GFP - dynamin - 2 - WT and - K44A showed the punctate localization pattern . GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 352 ) , - ( 351 – 870 ) and - ( 351 – 786 ) showedthediffusedlocalizationpattern . Strikingly , most cells expressing GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) exhibited a filamentous localization pattern . As shown in Fig . 3B , these filamentous structures were stained by anti - α - tubulin antibody . GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 745 ) , which lacked the PRD showed a punctate localization pattern . These observations suggest that N - terminus ( residues 746 – 786 ) of dynamin - 2 - PRD is the binding site of microtubules and that Fig . 4 – The filamentous localization of dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) disappear upon nocodazole treatment in interphase . ( A ) HeLa cells expressing GFP - dynamin - 2 - WT ( a – c ) and - ( 1 – 786 ) ( d – f ) were treated with ( b and e , 1 μ g / ml ; c and f , 2 μ g / ml ) or without ( a and d ) nocodazole and stained with anti - α - tubulin monoclonal antibody . Each mutant expressed in cells was detected by GFP fluorescence . Merged images of GFP - dynamin - 2 mutants ( green ) and α - tubulin ( red ) are shown on the right panels . Bar , 10 μ m . ( B ) Cells transfected with GFP - dynamin - 2 - WT ( n = 55 to 59 ) or - ( 1 – 786 ) ( n = 51 to 64 ) were classified into three distinctive patterns by the localization of dynamin - 2 ( diffused , gray ; punctate , green ; filamentous , yellow ) as described in Fig . 3 . Results are representative of three independent experiments . 1341 E X P E R I M E N T A L C E L L R E S E A R C H 3 1 5 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 1 3 3 6 – 1 3 4 5 the C - terminus ( residues 787 – 870 ) of dynamin - 2 - PRD inhibits the interaction of dynamin - 2 with microtubules . Furthermore , GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) - K44A did not show the filamentous localiza - tion pattern , suggesting that the GTPase activity of dynamin - 2 is required for recruitment of dynamin - 2 to microtubules . Localization of dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) is dependent of microtubules To examine whether the localization of dynamin - 2 is dependent on microtubules , HeLacellsexpressingGFP - dynamin - 2 - WTor - ( 1 – 786 ) 1342 E X P E R I M E N T A L C E L L R E S E A R C H 3 1 5 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 1 3 3 6 – 1 3 4 5 were treated with nocodazole , a microtubule - depolymerising reagent ( Fig . 4A ) . Disruption of microtubules by nocodazole did notaffectthedistribution of GFP - dynamin - 2 - WT ( Fig . 4A , panelsa , b and c ) . On the other hand , the filamentous localization of GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) disappeared upon treatment of nocodazole ( Fig . 4A , panels d , e and f ) . According to the method in Fig . 3C , we classified the cells into three distinctive patterns by the localization of GFP - dynamin - 2 ( Fig . 4B ) . Even in the presence of nocodazole , the localization of dynamin - 2 - WT remained as punctate structures . However , after nocodazole treatment , the filamentous localization pattern of GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) decreased with a corresponding increase in the punctate localization pattern . These indicate that microtubules are required for filamentous localization of GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) . HeLa cells expressing GFP - dynamin - 2 - WT or - ( 1 – 786 ) were alsotreatedwith ice - coldmedium ( Fig . 5A ) . Cold treatment did not affect the punctate localization of GFP - dynamin - 2 - WT ( Fig . 5A , panels a , b , c , d and e ) . On the other hand , the filamentous localization of GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) was reduced upon cold treatment ( Fig . 5A , panelsf , gandi ) , althoughsomecellsexpressing GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) maintained the filamentous localization ( Fig . 5A , panels h and j ) . According to the method in Fig . 3C , we classified the cells intothree distinctive patterns by the localization of GFP - dynamin - 2 ( Fig . 5B ) . Under cold treatment , only ~ 20 % ( 5 min ) and ~ 14 % ( 15 min ) of cells exhibited the filamentous localization pattern of GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) and the majority showed a punctate localization pattern . These results show that dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) associates with microtubules in interphase cells . Microtubules are cold - stable in the cells GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) To reveal a role of dynamin bound to microtubules in the cell , we counted cells with obvious microtubules ( see Fig . 5A , panels a ' , f ' , h ' and j ' ) in cells treated with cold ( Fig . 5C ) . In the iced GFP - dynamin - 2 - WT - expressing cells , most of the microtubule structures were disappeared . However , in the GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) - expressing cells after exposure to cold , microtubule structures still remained . These results suggest that the interaction of GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) with microtubules stabilizes the structures of microtubules in interphase cells . Discussion Dynamin was initially identified as a microtubule binding and bundling protein [ 6 ] . Moreover , as microtubules were potent activators of dynamin GTPase activity , it was suggested that dynamin functioned to regulate microtubule organization [ 8 , 9 ] . However , several more recent findings have argued that the interaction between dynamin and microtubules may not be relevant in vivo , especially in interphase cells : ( 1 ) overexpression of various dynamin GTPase mutants has no effect on microtubule organization , ( 2 ) microtubule disrupting drugs have no effect of dynamin distribution and ( 3 ) there is no colocalization between either endogenous or overexpressed dynamin and microtubules in interphase cells [ 7 , 20 , 21 ] . Interestingly , recent confocal micro - scopic observations revealed that dynamin colocalized with midzonal microtubules in mitotic rat liver [ 14 ] and HeLa cells ( this manuscript ) . Moreover , Züchner et al . showed that over - expression of a dynamin - 2 mutant bearing a deletion of three amino acids in PHD linked to Charcot – Marie – Tooth ( CMT ) disease induced the reorganization of microtubules [ 22 ] . Our data suggest that the interaction of dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) with microtubules increases the cold - stability of microtubules in the cells ( Figs . 5A and C ) . On the other hand , dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) failed to stabilize microtubules in cells treated with nocodazole ( Fig . 4A ) . These suggest that dynamin - 2 can stabilize microtubules against a mild stimulus like cold but not a noxious stimulus like a nocodazole . These findings strongly indicate that dynamin - 2 might be a genuine regulator in microtubule dynamics in the cell . We showed that the GTPase activity of dynamin - ( 1 – 786 ) is necessary for its interaction with microtubules in the cell ( Fig . 3A , panels c and d ) . In small GTPases such as Ras , it is quite clear that GTP and GDP binding results in different conformations of the protein [ 23 ] . It was also demonstrated that the GTP - bound form of dynamin - 2 differ from the GDP - bound form using limited proteolysis as a criterion [ 24 ] . Furthermore , GTP - dependent conformational changes of dynamin arose before and after GTP hydrolysis by examining the structures of lipid - bound oligomers [ 25 – 27 ] . These results suggest that the conformational change of dynamin - 2 by GTP - binding is important to regulate dynamin – microtubules interaction . Further experiments are required to elucidate how the N - terminus of dynamin - 2 ( GTPase domain ) controls the C - terminus of dynamin - 2 ( PRD ) . A previous in vitro biochemical report revealed that a papain - digested low - molecular - weight C - terminal fragment of dynamin could bind to microtubules [ 10 ] . This C - terminal fragment is basic and proline - rich , suggesting that PRD plays a microtubule - binding site of dynamin in vitro . The microtubule - binding domain of MAP2 , tau and MAP4 is the basic domain containing the PRD [ 28 – 30 ] . In particular , 215 KKVAVVR 221 in the PRD enhances the microtubule - binding of tau [ 31 ] . Furthermore , dynactin has two microtubule - binding domains , and one of the binding domains is the basic PRD [ 32 ] . These suggest that the basic amino acids in the PRD could bind to the acidic tubulin . Therefore , dynamin - 2 may also bind to microtubules via the basic amino acids in the PRD . Although it has been reported that the PRD of dynamin can bind to microtubules , immunofluorescent studies revealed no Fig . 5 – Microtubules are stabilized to cold treatment in the cells expressing with GFP - dynamin - 2 - ( 1 – 786 ) .

Szaszák et al . has reported that HA epitope - tagged PRD - deleted dynamin mutant ( 1 – 745 ) also localized as punctate structures but not filaments in CHO cells [ 16 ] . These data show that the N - terminus of PRD ( residues 746 – 786 ) in dynamin - 2 is a genuine microtubule - binding domain . How does the PRD regulate microtubule - binding of dynamin - 2 in the cell ? One possibility is that binding of other proteins , such as Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) - domain proteins , to dynamin - PRD regulates the binding ability of dynamin to microtubules . Dynamin function is mediated in part through association of its PRD with the SH3 domains of several putative dynamin partners , such as endophilin , amphiphysin , syndapin ( PACSIN ) , cortactin etc . [ 5 , 24 ] . The C - terminus of PRD includes a cortactin - binding ( 827 APPQIPSRP 835 ) and endophilin 1 and other SH3 - containing dynamin partners - binding ( including consensus PXXP ) motifs . In mitotic cells , if these dynamin partners associate with the C - terminus of PRD , it might induce the association of microtubules with dynamin - 2 . Further , the N - terminus of PRD contains the second endophilin - binding motif ( 765 PTPQRRPVSSIHPPGRP 781 ) [ 24 ] . It has been shown that phosphorylation of dynamin by cdc2 kinase reduced its binding ability to microtubules in vitro [ 11 ] . Interestingly , as the second endophilin - binding motif contains consensus sequence of cdc2 phosphorylation ( 766 TPQR 769 ) , the binding of endophilin to this region might inhibit cdc2 phosphorylation and consequently maintain the association of dynamin - 2 with microtubules in mitotic cells . Another possibility is that the C - terminus of PRD ( residues 787 – 870 ) acts as an inhibitory region against micro - tubule - binding of the N - terminus of PRD in interphase cell . However , as the high - resolution structural data of dynamin - 2 is restricted only to the GTPase and PHD so far [ 33 , 34 ] , structural analysis of C - terminal domain of dynamin - 2 will be necessary to address this issue . We are currently carrying out experiments to elucidate possible mitosis - specific binding of dynamin partner ( s ) to provide a physiological insight into dynamin - microtubule interaction .
