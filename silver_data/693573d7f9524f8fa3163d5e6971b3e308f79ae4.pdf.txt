Endocytosis Is Required for the Growth of Vacuolar H + - ATPase - defective Yeast : Identification of Six New END Genes Alan L . Munn and Howard Riezman Department of Biochemistry , Biozentrum of the University of Basel , Basel , CH - 4056 , Switzerland Abstract . Yeast mutants that are defective in acidification of the lysosome - like vacuole are able to grow at pH 5 . 5 , but not at pH 7 . Here , we present evi - dence that endocytosis is required for this low pH - dependent growth and use this observation to develop a screen for mutants defective in endocytosis . By iso - lating mutants that cannot grow when they lack the 60 - kD vacuolar ATPase subunit ( encoded by the VAT2 gene ) , we isolated a number of vat2 - synthetic lethal ( Vsl - ) mutant strains . Seven of the Vsl - mutants are defective in endocytosis . Four of these mutant strains ( endS - l , end9 - 1 , endlO - l , and end11 - 1 ) show altered up - take of the endocytosed ligand , a - factor , and three ( end124 , endl2 - 2 , and end134 ) are probably defective in transfer of internalized material to the vacuole . Most of the mutations also confer a strong Ts - growth defect . The mutants defective in uptake of or - factor sort newly synthesized vacuolar proteins correctly , while those which may be defective in subsequent transport steps secrete at least a fraction of the newly synthesized soluble vacuolar proteins . The mutations that result in a defect in u - factor uptake are not allelic to any of the genes previously shown to encode endo - cytic functions . NDOCYTOSIS is a general mechanism that allows eu - karyotic ceils to internalize both plasma membrane and extracellular material . Experiments with cul - tured mammalian cells ( where endocytosis has been well - characterized at a morphological level ) have demonstrated that fluid - phase markers such as horseradish peroxidase or colloidal gold particles are internalized and can be visualized in cell sections by electron microscopy ( Hopkins and Trow - bridge , 1983 ; Steiuman et al . , 1983 ) . After short periods of internalization , the markers are seen in invaginations of the plasma membrane known as coated pits ( Anderson et al . , 1977 ; Hopkins and Trowbridge , 1983 ) . These pits bear a coat composed of polymerized clathrin on their cytoplasmic face which has been implicated in the rapid internalization of most , but not all , endocytic markers ( Pearse and Robin - son , 1990 ; Hansen et al . , 1993 ) . After longer incubation times , the markers label peripheral early endosomes which have a tubuloreticular profile in cell sections and subse - quently perinuclear , late endosomes which have a multi - vesicular structure and which contain mannose 6 - phosphate receptors ( Helenius et al . , 1983 ; Hopkins and Trowbridge , 1983 ; Gritiiths et al . , 1988 ) . The mechanism of transport of markers from early to late endosomes is unclear . Transport may occur via budding and fusion of transport vesicles or by a maturation process ( Griffiths and Gruenberg , 1991 ; Murphy , 1991 ) . In any event , after prolonged internalization , the bulk of the non - specific markers are localized in lysosomes , which are the major degradative compartments in the cell and are the site where all fluid - phase markers eventually accumulate ( Korn - feld and Mellman , 1989 ) . The rate of endocytosis of fluid as estimated using lucifer yellow - carbohydrazide ( LY ) I may vary between cell types , but in murine peritoneal macro - phages an estimate is 250 nl / mg of cellular protein / hour ( Swanson et al . , 1985 ) . Endocytosis of extracellular fluid by S . cerevisiae has been demonstrated using LY . Uptake of LY leads to its accumula - tion in the vacuole ( the yeast equivalent of the mammalian lysosome ) and is time - , energy - , and temperature - dependent , consistent with an endocytic mechanism ( Riezman , 1985 ) . The rate of endocytosis has been estimated as 27 nl / mg of cellular protein / hour at 30°C ( Riezman , 1985 ) . The mat - ing pheromone a - factor is a marker for receptor - mediated endocytosis in yeast and is internalized while bound to Address all correspondence to Dr .

Internalized a - factor is transported through two intermediate compartments en route to the vacuole where it is degraded by resident vacuolar proteases ( Singer and Riezman , 1990 ; Singer - Kriiger et al . , 1993 ) . Recently , two mutants , end3 - 1 and end4 - 1 , that are defec - tive for both fluid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis , but have no defect in vacuolar protein biogenesis have been isolated and characterized ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) . Mutations in END3 or END4 lead to defects in the internalization step of endocytosis . This step also requires actin and the actin fila - ment - bundling protein , fimbrin ( AC ' / / and SAC6 gene prod - ucts ) ( Kiibler and Riezman , 1993 ) . Tan et al . ( 1993 ) have shown that clathrin heavy chain ( CHC1 gene product ) also plays an important role in the internalization step of endocy - tosis in yeast . Fewer mutants exist that specifically affect later stages of endocytosis in yeast . Mutations in the YPT51 / VPS21 ( Singer - Kriiger et al . , 1994 ; Horazdovsky et al . , 1994 ) and YPT7 ( Wichmann et al . , 1992 ; Schimm611er and Riezman , 1993 ) genes , which encode putative small GTPases of the rab fam - ily , specifically affect delivery of internalized material to the vacuole , but also affect vacuole biogenesis . Another mutant , renl / vps2 , may also affect a late step in the endocytic pathway ( Davis et al . , 1993 ) . The vacuolar system of the yeast cell , and possibly other organdies , are acidified by the action of a membrane - associated H÷ - ATPase which in yeast comprises at least 10 subunits of sizes 102 , 95 , 69 , 60 , 54 , 42 , 36 , 32 , 27 , and 17 kD ( Ho et al . , 1993 ; Manolson et al . , 1994 ) . The 60 - kD subunit is encoded by the VA / 2 gene ( Nelson et al . , 1989 ; Yamashiro et al . , 1990 ) . In strains bearing a disruption mu - tation of VAl2 ( vat2A ) , the ATPase does not assemble on the vacuolar membrane and consequently the lumen of the vacu - ole fails to become acidified ( Yamashiro et ai . , 1990 ) . vat2A strains can grow if the external medium is between pH 5 and pH 6 , but are unable to grow if the medium is buffered at pH 7 or above ( Nelson and Nelson , 1990 ; Yamashiro et al . , 1990 ) . Nelson and Nelson ( 1990 ) have proposed that in the absence of vacuolar ATPase activity , fluid - phase endocytosis may be sufficient to acidify endocytic compartments when the external medium is acidic . This is illustrated in Fig . 1 ( see Results ) . When the external medium is of low pH , the vacuolar system may be acidified either by ATPase - driven H ÷ pumping or by endocytosis . Here we provide experimental evidence that endocytosis is indeed required for growth of vat2A mutant strains on acidic medium and we have exploited this observation to iso - late new end mutants that are defective in specific steps of transport from the external environment to the vacuole .

For growth of vat2A mutant strains the pH of the YPUAD was adjusted with HCI to 5 where specified . Minimal medium for plasmid selection was SD ( Dull6 et al . , 1991 ) . Where specified , additional nutrients were added to the SD medium to give a 40 - / ~ g / ml final concentration . SD contained one or several of the following seven nutrient supplements when required : adenine , uracil , tryptophan , histidine , lysine , leucine , and tyrosine . The pH of our SD medium was 5 . 3 - 5 . 5 . SD medium containing 5 fluoroorotic acid ( 5FOA ) ( 1 mg / mi final con - centration ) ( SD / 5FOA ) was used to select for ceils which had been cured of URA3 plasmids ( Boeke et al . , 1984 ) . 5FOA ( PeR Inc . , Gainsville , FL ) was added to SD medium to 1 rng / rnl final concentration and uracil was added to 50 t * g / ml final concentration . Additional supplements were added where required for growth and the pH was adjusted to 5 . 3 - 5 . 5 by addition of 10 M NaOH . The pH of SD / 5FOA plates was the same as the SD plates . Where growth on SD / 5FOA and SD was directly compared , e . g . , during the mutant screen , the SD plates contained 50 / zg / ml uracil in addition to the nutrients needed for growth . All solid media contained 2 % Bactoagar ( Difco , Detroit , M1 ) . SD ( low sulfate ) and SD ( no sulfate ) have been de - scribed ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) . ~ - Factor internalizations were performed using metabolically labeled [ 35S ] a - factor purified essentially as described by Duli ~ et al . , 1991 . The procedure for biosynthetic labeling of a - factor was modified slightly ; a 30 - rain preincubation in SD ( no sulfate ) was included before the addition of the Na235SO4 label and labeling was for only 8 h , since this increased the yield of radiolabeled a - factor considerably . The Na235SO4 ( 40 mCi / ml ) used for metabolic labeling was obtained from Amersham PLC ( Amer - sham , UK ) . LY accumulation was assayed using LY obtained from Fluke ( Buchs , Switzerland ) . ~ - Factor degradation was assessed by separating intact from degraded a - factor on preparative silica gel 60 plates ( 2 . 2 - mm - thick , 20 x 20 era ) thin layer chromatography plates supplied by Merck ( [ Switzerland ] AG , Dietikon , Switzerland ) . Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was car - ried out as described by Laemmli ( 1970 ) using 7 . 5 % polyacrylamide / SDS gels . Acrylarnide was obtained from BDH ( Foole , UK ) and sodium dodecyl sulfate was obtained from Sigma Chem . Co . , St . Louis , MO . FOr fluorogra - phy , the gels were soaked first in water , and then in 1 M sodium salicylate pH 10 for 1 h , and then dried under vacuum . The gels were exposed to preflashed Kodak XAR X - ray film ( Kodak , Rochester , NY ) at - 800C and developed using a Fuji automatic film developer . Yeast Genetic Techniques Mating of yeast cells , sporulation of diploid strains , tetrad dissection , and scoring of genetic markers was performed as described by Sherman et al . ( 1974 ) . Transformation of yeast cells was accomplished by the lithium ace - rate method of Ito et al . ( 1983 ) . Testing for temperature - sensitive growth was done by streaking yeast cells for single colonies on two YPUAD plates and incubating one plate for 3 d at 24°C and one plate for 3 d at 37°C . Mutagenesis and Colethality Screen The strain RH1937 , which has the chromosomal copy of the VAT2 gene dis - rupted with LEU2 and carries a YCp50 - based plasmid ( pCY36 ; Yamashiro et al . , 1990 ) containing both the URA3 and the VA / 2 genes , was used for isolation of vat2 - synthetic lethal ( Vsl - ) mutants ( Table D . The rationale for the screen is shown in Fig . 3 . RH1937 cells were mutagenized and mutants that were unable to lose the pCY36 plasmid ( thereby uncovering the vat2 chromosomal mutation ) were identified by their inability to grow on SD / 5FOA . SD / 5FOA selects for cells which do not have a wild - type URA3 gene ; in this case cells that have lost the pC ' Y36 plasmid . The method used for mutagenizing yeast cells with ethyl methanesulfonic acid ( EMS ) ( Sigma Chem . Co . ) was described in Munn et al . ( 1991 ) . A treatment with EMS which resulted in 30 % cell viability was used for the mutant screen . Approximately 7 , 000 colonies derived from RH1937 cells mutagenized in this way and selected for plasmid retention on SD plates lacking uracil ( , ~ 200 colonies per plate ) were subjected to screening by replica plating onto SD and SD / 5FOA selection plates containing uracil . Colonies which grew on SD , but not on SD / 5FOA after replica plating were restreaked on both media and incubated at 24°C and 300C . Those isolates which grew on SD , but gave few or no colonies on SD / 5FOA at both temper - atures were retained . In this way we isolated 18 mutants . LY Accumulation Assays These were performed as described by Dull6 et al . ( 1991 ) . All incubations were at 24°C for 1 h and the cells were vigorously aerated before incuba - tion . The cells were washed in 1 ml of ice - cold 50 mM sodium phosphate / 10 mM sodium azide / 10 mM sodium fluoride pH 7 . 5 ( SPAF ) four times after incubation with LY . The cells were then resuspended in 30 # 1 of SPAF and viewed by fluorescence microscopy as described by Duli ~ et al . ( 1991 ) . or - Factor Uptake Assays [ 35S ] c ~ - factor uptake assays were performed on mid - log phase cells ( 107 cells / mi ) using the continuous presence protocol as described by Duli ~ et al . ( 1991 ) . The assays were carried out at 24°C and at 370C with a 15 - min preshift before cx - factor addition . Internalization was calculated by dividing the internalized counts ( pH 1 - resistant ) by the total cell - associated counts ( pH 6 - resistant ) for each time point , except in the case of the endlO - 1 mu - tant . For the endlO - 1 mutant , internalized a - factor was calculated by divid - ing pH l - resistant counts at each time point by the pH 6 - resistant counts at 5 min . The cell - associated counts decreased very rapidly in this mutant at 37°C , probably due to dissociation of uninternalized a - factor from the receptor . or - Factor Degradation Assays [ 3SS ] a - factor degradation assays were performed on mid - log phase cells ( 107 celis / ml ) using the pulse - chase ( [ 3SS ] c ~ - factor prebinding for 50 min on ice ) protocol as described by Duli ~ et al . ( 1991 ) . All assays were per - formed at 30°C , which is the optimal temperature for c ~ - factor degradation . Filter lmmunoblot for Detection of Secreted CPY The secretion of CPY from yeast cells during growth was analyzed using the method described by Roberts et al . ( 1991 ) . Yeast cells were grown on YPUAD plates in contact with a 0 . 45 - ~ m nitrocellulose filter ( Schteicher and Schuell , Dassel , Germany ) ( overlaid after inoculation of the plate ) at 24°C . After incubation in contact with the filter for , , o40 - - 48 h , the filter was removed from the plate and the adherent yeast cells were eluted with water . The filter was then blocked with PBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ( Merck ) and 2 % milk powder ( PBSTM ) for 2 h at room temperature . The filter was then incubated for 3 h with a polycional rabbit antiserum against CPY at 1 : 1 , 000 dilution in PBSTM . After washing three times in PBSTM , the filter was probed for 1 h with goat anti - rabbit IgG coupled to horserad - ish peroxidase ( Sigma Immunochemicals ) at 1 : 5 , 000 dilution in PBSTM . Immunoreactive protein bound to the filter was detected by enhanced che - miluminescence ( ECL ) using the Amersham system and exposure to Kodak XAR x - ray film . Metabolic Labeling of CPY Metabolic labeling of cells with Na235SO4 , preparation of spheroplasts , ly - sis of the spheroplasts , and immuneprecipitation of the labeled CPY from the lysates were all carried out as previously described ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) with two modifications . First , the labelings were performed on cells which had been preshifted to 37°C for 15 min . Second , a protease inhibitor cock - tail was added to each fraction before addition of SDS and heating of the samples to 90°C . The final concentrations of protease inhibitors were : 0 . 5 mM PMSF ( Sigma Chem . Co . ) , 1 / ~ g / mi pepstatin ( Bonhringer - Mannheim Biochemicals , Mannheim , Germany ) , 1 / ~ g / mi leupeptin ( Boehringer - Mannheim ) . Immuneprecipitates were electrophoresed on 7 . 5 % polyacryl - amide / SDS gels and analyzed by fluorography using Kodak XAR X - ray film . The end8 - 1 mutant was labeled with [ 35S ] methionine and cysteine ( ICN Biochemicals , Irvine , CA ) using the method described by Munn et al . ( 1991 ) , since it was found to label poorly with Na235SO4 at 37°C . Results Yeast Mutants Defective in Both Vacuolar Acidification and Endocytosis Are Inviable It has been postulated that ( a ) yeast mutants which have a defective vacuolar H + - ATPase may be able to acidify their vacuoles by fluid phase endocytosis if they are grown in acidified medium and ( b ) that acidification of the vacuole ei - ther by H + - pumping or by fluid - phase endocytosis of acidi - Munn and Riezman Vacuolar Acidification and Endocytosis Mutants 375 on F eb r ua r y 21 , 2013 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published October 15 , 1994 fled medium may be essential for growth ( Nelson and Nel - son , 1990 ) . The hypothesis that yeast cells can acidify their vacuoles by two independent pathways is illustrated schemat - ically in Fig . 1 . To test whether yeast strains that are defective in both vacuolar acidification and fluid - phase endocytosis are inviable , we attempted to construct strains carrying mu - tations in both VAT2 and END3 , or in both VAT2 and END4 . Yeast cells that carry a vat2A mutation are inviable at pH 7 , but can grow even at 37°C on rich medinm between pH 5 and pH 6 ( Nelson and Nelson , 1990 ; Yamashiro et al . , 1990 ) . In contrast , both end3A and end4A cells arc inviable at 37°C ( Btnddctti , H . , and L . Hick¢ , personal communica - tion ) . Two diploid strains , heterozygous for vat2A and end3A and for vat2A and end4A , respectively , were sporu - lated , the resulting tetrads were dissected onto rich medium at pH 5 , and the haploid spores were allowed to form colo - nies at 24°C ( see Materials and Methods ) . The growth of haploid colonies from spores derived from the end3A × vat2A diploid is shown in Fig . 2 . Similar results were ob - tained from dissection of tetrads from a end4A × vat2A diploid ( data not shown ) . The tetrads derived from both strains were of three classes . Approximately 25 % of the tetrads contained four viable spores , 50 % of the tetrads con - tained three viable spores , and 25 % of the tetrads contained only two viable spores ( Table II , A and B ) , suggesting that two mutations segregated independently in each cross and that the combination of the two mutations was lethal . The to - tal number of spores of each genotype obtained from the end3A × vat2A dissection are shown in Table II C . No viable Figure 1 . Schematic representation of a yeast cell depicting the en - docytic compartments ( pr / mary endocytic vesicles , early endo - some , late endosome , and vacuole ) and the Golgi apparatus . The compartments that may have an acidified lumen are indicated by shading ( in some cases the pH is only known for the mammalian counterpart ) . According to the proposal of Nelson and Nelson ( 1990 ) these compartments may be acidified in two ways . ( / ) Pro - tons may be pumped into the lumen of the acidified organelles from the cytoplasm by the vacuolar H + - ATPase ( the 60 - kD subunit of which is encoded by the VAT2 gene ) . ( 2 ) Protons may be taken up from the acidified external environment ( pH 5 . 5 ) by fluid - phase en - docytosis , and acidification of the various compartments may occur via transport through the endocytic pathway . In wild - type ( VAT2 ) yeast cells the vacuole has been shown to have a pH of 6 CYamashiro et al . , 1990 ) . The site of the endocytic block caused by the end3A and end4A mutations is indicated ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) . A block in endocytosis in conjunction with a defective vacuolar ATPase would be predicted to prevent acidification of the vacuole even when the cells are grown on acidic medium . Figure 2 . Tetrads derived from a diploid strain heterozygous for both end3A and vat2A . The diploid strain ( RH1931 ) was sporulated and tetrads were dissected onto YPUAD medium at pH 5 . The spores were allowed to germinate and form colonies at 24°C . Note that many spores did not give rise to colonies . These spores were those that inherited both the end3A and vat2A mutations . vat2A endA double mutants were recovered . Presumptive vat2AendA spores did germinate in most cases , but gave microcolonies of less than 200 cells in the case of end3A x vat2A and less than 20 cells in the case of end4A x vat2A ( data not shown ) . Isolation of Mutants Synthetically Lethal with vat2A The observation that both end3 and end4 mutations are colethal with a vat2 mutation at pH 5 indicated that it might be possible to isolate additional end mutations by screening for vat2 - synthetic lethal mutants ( Vsl - ) , and then testing the Vsl - mutants for defects in endocytosis . We started with a strain which contains a chromosomal disruption of VAT2 and a centromere plasmid carrying both URA3 and the wild - type VAT2 gene ( Table I ) . This strain is also MATa and bar1 so that it is possible to directly assay the mutants obtained from this strain for defects in < x - factor internalization . A screen Was conducted ( Fig . 3 ) and retesting of growth on SD and on SD / 5FOA at both 24 and 30°C indicated that 18 isolates were most strongly affected for growth on SD / SFOA at both temperatures . Mutants having defects at both 24 and 30°C were thought to be more likely to bear nonconditional muta - tions and therefore to affect nonessential genes . This ration - ale was predicted to favor isolation of mutants distinct from previously isolated mutants such as actl - 1 , end2 - 1 , and the sec mutants which have End - phenotypes but possess temperature - conditional mutations in essential genes ( No - vick and Botstein , 1985 ; Riezman , 1985 ; Chvatchko et al . , 1986 ) . The growth of various Vsl - mutants on SD and SD / 5FOA at 24°C is shown in Fig . 4 . Some of the mutants ( e . g . , 10 , 121 ) gave rise to a few colonies which grew well on SD / SFOA and these presumably arose by mutation at sup - prcssor loci or gene conversion of vat2A by the plasmid copy of the gene before plasmid loss . The number of these colo - nies varied from one experiment to another , but most of the cells that lost the plasmid gave microcolonies on SD / SFOA . Cells that are URA3 ( e . g . , cells which have not lost the plas - mid ) do not even form microcolonies on SD / SFOA ( data not shown ) . The inability of the Vsl - mutants to grow on SD / 5FOA was not due to integration of pCY36 into the chromo - some or gene conversion of the chromosomal ura3 mutation , because when mated to the wild - type ura3 MATc ~ strain RH449 , all the resulting diploids were able to grow on SD / SFOA .

The vat2 - synthetic lethality ( Vsl - ) mutant screen . The starting strain was RH1937 , which has a chromosomal deletion of the VAT2 gene ( vat2A ) marked with LEU2 and a centromere plasmid ( pCY36 ) carrying the wild - type VAT2 and URA3 genes . After muta - genesis , some of the cells will gain a new mutation which prevents growth without a wild - type copy of VAT2 ( Vsl - ) . SD / 5FOA is used to select for those ceils in each colony of mutagenized RH1937 which have lost the pCY36 plasmid during growth and become Ura - . None of the cells in the Vsl - mutant colonies will be able to grow on SD / 5FOA , since they cannot grow without the VAT2 gene . On the other hand , cells in the Vsl + colonies can lose the pCY36 plasmid . Those Vsl + cells which do become Ura - will grow on SD / 5FOA . The results of complementation analysis performed after the first hackcross suggested that mutants 38 and 43 are in one complementation group and the other five End - Vsl - mutants are in distinct complementation groups . The defini - tion of six complementation groups was confirmed in the complementation analysis based on temperature - sensitivity described later . Many of the Vsl - Mutants Are Defective for Lucifer Yellow Accumulation in the Vacuole We examined the ability of the Vsl - mutants to carry out fluid - phase endocytosis by assaying the accumulation of the fluid - phase marker LY in the vacuole ( Materials and Meth - ods ) . One of the Vsl - mutants ( 113 ) had no visible vacuole when viewed by Nomarski optics and therefore could not be tested for LY accumulation ( data not shown ) . Each of the other mutants had either a few small vacuoles or one large vacuole ( Fig . 5 , B - G ) similar to the wild - type strain ( Fig . Figure 4 . Growth of Vsl - mutant strains on SD ( I ) , but not on SD / 5FOA ( II ) . The mutant strains 10 ( RH1972 ) ( A ) , 19 ( RH1973 ) ( B ) , 38 ( RH1974 ) ( C ) , 43 ( RH1975 ) ( D ) , 72 ( E ) , 95 ( F ) , 113 ( G ) , 121 ( H ) , 62 ( RH1976 ) ( I ) , 73 ( RH1977 ) ( J ) , 82 ( RH1978 ) ( K ) , and the wild - type strain RH1937 ( L ) were streaked out on SD ( pH 5 . 5 ) and on SD / SFOA ( pH 5 . 5 ) plates and allowed to form colonies at 24°C . Only the wild - type parent strain RH1937 ( L ) is able to form a large number of fast - growing colonies on SD / 5FOA plates . Some strains , e . g . , RH1972 ( A ) and 121 ( H ) , occasionally give slow - growing colonies on SD / 5FOA plates , but the majority of cells do not grow or form only microcolonies on this medium . Ura + cells do not even form microcolonies on SD / 5FOA plates .

Mutants 10 , 19 , 38 , 43 , 62 , 73 , and 82 ( 7 of 18 total ) were defective for accumulation of LY in the vacuole at 24°C ( Fig . 5 , B ' - G ' ) compared to the wild - type strain ( Fig . 5 A ' ) , while most of the other mutants showed approximately wild - type levels of LY accumulation in the vacuole at 24°C ( data not shown ) . The mutant 82 showed a unique staining pattern with LY . In certain cells it was possible to see a faint reticular staining surrounding the vacuole , suggesting that perhaps this mutant took up some LY but did not deliver it to the vacuole . This staining was very faint and is not obvious in Fig . 5 . Those Vsl - mutants which had defects in endocytosis were designated end mutants . Thus mutants 10 , 19 , 38 / 43 , 62 , 73 , and 82 define END13 , END & END12 , ENDg , ENDIO , and ENDll , respectively .

To determine where the endo - cytic defect lies , we assayed each of the new end mutants for internalization of a - factor at 24 and 37°C ( Materials and Methods ) . Uptake of a - factor exhibited nearly wild - type ki - netics at 37°C in the endl2d , endl2 - 2 , and endl3d mutants ( Fig . 6 , E and F , data for endl2 - 2 not shown ) , but was clearly defective in the end8 - 1 , end9 - 1 , endlO - 1 , and endll - 1 mutants ( Fig . 6 , A - D ) . Interestingly , uptake of a - factor exhibited wild - type kinetics at 24°C in the end8 - 1 mutant ( Fig . 6 A ) , and was significantly faster at 24°C than at 37°C in the end9 - 1 mutant . ~ Factor uptake by the endll - 1 mutant ( Fig . 6 D ) was defective at both temperatures , although the initial rate of uptake ( first 5 min ) was nearly like that in the wild - type strain . After 15 rain at 37°C , the endll - 1 mutant stopped accumulating internalized a - factor as there was no further increase in internal counts . At this time point only ' ~ 50 - 60 % of the bound pheromone was resistant to an acid wash . The defect in a - factor uptake shown by the endlO - 1 mutant ( Fig . 6 C ) was similar to that exhibited by the endll - 1 mutant , ex - cept that in the former mutant the noninternalized a - factor dissociated rapidly from the cells . The end124 , end12 - 2 , and endl3 - 1 Mutants Are Defective in Degradation of Internalized u - Factor To measure later steps of endocytosis , we tested those end mutants which were defective for LY accumulation but were not defective for a - factor uptake , for a - factor degradation at 30°C ( Materials and Methods ) . We chose 30°C because pheromone delivery to the vacuole is optimal at this temper - ature . The results of these experiments are shown in Fig . 7 . The end13 - 1 mutant showed a strong delay in degradation of internalized a - factor at 30°C compared to the wild - type strain and the endl2 - 1 ( and endl2 - 2 ) mutants show almost no degradation of the internalized a - factor even at late time points ( 90 ) . The end / / - / mutant also showed very little degradation of the small amount of internalized a - factor ( data not shown ) . The endl2 - 1 and encU3 - 1 Mutants Missort Newly Synthesized Vacuolar Hydrolases In yeast , soluble vacuolar proteins transit through endo - somal compartments on their way to the lysosome or vacuole ( Schimm611er and Riezman , 1993 ; Raymond et al . , 1992 ; Vida et al . , 1993 ; Davis et al . , 1993 ) . It is therefore possible that certain mutations that block or delay transport between endosomal compartments or from endosomal compartments to the vacuole might cause a defect in the correct sorting and maturation of soluble vacuolar hydrolases . We therefore screened the new end mutants for secretion of carboxypepti - dase Y ( CPY ) , a soluble glycoprotein of the yeast vacuole . The end mutants were grown on a nitrocellulose filter at The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 127 , 1994 378 on F eb r ua r y 21 , 2013 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published October 15 , 1994 Table H C .

The data is from the experiment described in Table II A .

The result is shown in Fig . 8 . The endl2 - 1 and end13 - 1 mutants were positive for the presence of CPY on the filter and the endS - l , end9 - 1 , and endll - 1 mutants were negative as was the wild - type strain . The results obtained with the endlO - 1 mu - tant were intermediate and probably reflect some cell lysis ( see below ) . To further analyze delivery of CPY to the vacuole , we per - formed a pulse - chase radiolabeling of newly synthesized CPY in each end mutant . CPY is synthesized as a precursor ( prepro - CPY ) with an NH2 - terminal signal sequence and is translocated into the lumen of the ER . In the ER , CPY receives four core oligosaccharides to yield a protein of 67 kD known as pl CPY . CPY is then transported to the Golgi where it receives outer chain mannose residues and increases in size to 69 kD ( p2 form ) . From the Golgi , the CPY is trans - ported to the vacuole where it is cleaved to a 61 - kD form which is the mature , active species . The formation of 61 kD CPY is indicative of correct vacuolar delivery of CPY ( for review see Rothman et al . , 1989 ; Klionsky et al . , 1990 ) . The new end mutants were pulse - labeled with Na235SO , or [ 35S ] methionine and cysteine , chased with cold sulfate , methionine , and cysteine , and separated into intraceUular and extraceUular ( including perplasmic ) fractions . Labeled newly synthesized CPY was immuneprecipitated at various time points after initiation of the chase from both fractions and displayed on SDS - PAGE gels ( Fig . 9 ) . The endS - l , end9 - 1 , endlO - 1 , end11 - 1 , and endl3 - 1 mutants exhibited wild - type kinetics of CPY maturation in the intracellular fractions whereas the end12 - 1 mutant was severely defective for maturation of CPY . Although the end13 - 1 mutant ma - tured intracellular CPY with wild - type kinetics , a small amount of the newly synthesized CPY was secreted as p2 CPY into the extracellular fraction . Thus , the pulse - chase labeling data agrees with the filter immunoassay data , and shows that only end124 ( and end12 - 2 ) and end13 - 1 have defects in delivery of CPY to the vacuole . Since these mu - tants were also defective in degradation of internalized a - fac - tor , this result is consistent with the idea that delivery of newly synthesized CPY to the vacuole and late steps in en - docytosis require common gene products . Further work will be needed to establish that the a - factor degradation pheno - types of these mutants are really due to transport blocks and are not due to a lowered ability of the vacuoles in these mu - tants to degrade c ~ - factor . All of the New end Mutants Affect Nuclear Genes and Display Defective Growth at Elevated Temperatures All of the new end mutants ( with the exception of endl2 - 2 , which is allelic to endl2 - 1 ) were outcrossed to the congenic wild - type strains RH449 ( once ) and RH977 or RH978 ( twice ) . The defect in uptake of LY segregated 2 : 2 in every tetrad examined , indicating that the End - phenotype is caused by a lesion in a nuclear - encoded gene . In addition , an unselected defect in growth at elevated temperature segregated with each endocytic defect . The end8 - 1 , end9 - 1 , endlO - 1 , and end12 - 1 ( and end12 - 2 ) mutants caused a tight block in growth at 37°C , whereas the end11 - 1 strain grew poorly at all temperatures tested ( 24 and 37°C ) and the end13 - 1 strain was only completely defective for growth at 39°C ( the wild - type strain grew slowly at this temperature ) . The Ts - in each end mutant was complemented in heterozy - gous diploids . Hence the Ts - phenotype which cosegregates with each end mutation is recessive . Other mutants have been isolated in our laboratory and in other laboratories that affect the internalization step of en - docytosis . Among these are chcl - 521 ( clathrin heavy chain ) ( Payne et al . , 1988 ; Tan et al . , 1993 ) , clclA ( clathrin light chain ) ( Silveira et al . , 1990 ) , act1 - 1 ( actin ) ( Novick and Bot - stein , 1985 ; Kiibler and Riezman , 1993 ) , sac6A ( fimbrin ) ( Adams et al . , 1991 ; Kiibler and Riezman , 1993 ) , cmdl - 1 ( calmodulin ) ( Davis , 1992 ; Kiibler , E . , E Schimmtller , and H . Riezman , manuscript in preparation ) , end3 - 1 ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) , end4 - 1 ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) , endS - l , end6 - 1 , and endT - 1 ( Munn , A . L . , and H . Riezman , unpublished data ) . All of these mutants , like the new end mutants , exhibit tem - perature - sensitive growth . We tested each of the new end mutants for complementation with these mutants . All pair - wise combinations exhibited complementation . All the mu - tations were recessive to the wild - type allele in heterozygous diploids ( data not shown ) . Hence , the new end mutants iso - lated in the Vsl - screen that are defective in the internaliza - tion step identify a new set of genes required for fluid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis in yeast . The end12 and end13 mutants , which show a vacuolar pro - tein sorting ( vps ) phenotype , were tested by complementa - tion analysis with the vps mutant collection ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . end12 did not complement vps34 , and end13 did not complement vps4 . Therefore , the new screening procedure also identifies a subset of vps mutants that affect the endo - cytic pathway ( see Discussion ) . Discussion In previous work , two yeast mutants blocked in the first step of endocytosis were isolated . These mutants carried lesions in distinct genes , END3 and END4 ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) . In this study , we have shown that the combination of end3A or end4A mutations with a vat2A mutation resulted in spores Munn and Riezman Vacuolar Acidification and Endocytosis Mutants 379 on F eb r ua r y 21 , 2013 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published October 15 , 1994 Figure 5 . Some Vsl - mutants are defective for accumulation of LY in the vacuole ( End - ) . The wild - type strain RH144 - 3D ( END ) ( A ) and the three time outcrossed mutants 10 ( endl3 - 1 ) ( RI - I2604 ) ( B ) , 19 ( endS - l ) ( RH2607 ) ( C ) , 38 ( endl2 - 1 ) ( RH2611 ) ( D ) , 62 ( endg - 1 ) ( RH2615 ) ( E ) , 73 ( endlO - 1 ) ( RH2618 ) ( F ) , and 82 ( endll - 1 ) ( RH2622 ) ( G ) were assayed for accumulation of LY in the vacuole at 24 " C as described in Materials and Methods . The upper panel in each pair ( A - G ) shows a field of cells viewed with Nomarski optics , and the lower panel in each pair ( A ' - ¢7 ) shows the same field of cells viewed with FITC - fluorescenee optics . The vacuoles in each cell are visible as indentations when observed with Nomarski filters . If the vacuoles have accumulated LY , then they are also visible with fluorescence optics . All the mutants shown have vacuoles which are clearly visible in the Nomarski photographs , but which are unstained or stained poorly with LY compared to the wild - type strain in the fluorescence photographs . The original mutants RH1972 ( endl3 - 1 ) , RH1973 ( endS - 1 ) , RH1974 ( endl2 - 1 ) , RH1975 ( endl2 - 2 ) , RH1976 ( end9 - 1 ) , RH1977 ( endlO - 1 ) , and RH1978 ( endll - 1 ) have similar defects in LY accumulation . that germinated but did not give rise to colonies . Therefore , it seems that in the absence of the normal mechanism for acidification of the vacuolar system , endocytosis of acidic , external fluid can allow vat2A mutant cells to grow . When these ceils are also unable to endocytose , the vacuolar sys - tem cannot be acidified and this leads to lack of growth con - sistent with the hypothesis put forward by Nelson and Nelson ( 1990 ) . It is quite possible that the rate at which the vat2A cells acidify their vacuolar system by endocytosis is limiting for growth and is responsible for their slow generation time .

The experiments described in this report suggest the possi - bility that an organelle ( s ) of the vacuolar or secretory system must be acidified to allow growth . Further work will be needed to determine whether or not this is true . Ifa compart - ment is being acidified via endocytosis , however , several ob - servations may be useful clues to the identity of this compart - ment . First , not all mutations that affect accumulation of LY in the vacuole are synthetically lethal with vat2 mutations . In particular , the ypt7 mutation , which delays endocytic traffic from late endosomes to vacuoles , is not synthetically lethal with vat2 ( Schimm611er and Riezman , 1993 ; Schim - m611er , E , unpublished observations ) . On the other hand , some mutants that affect postinternalization stages of en - docytosis , e . g . , the endl2 - 1 , endl2 - 2 , and endl3 - 1 mutants described here , are synthetically lethal with vat2 . This sug - gests that if uptake of the acidic medium is important for growth , uptake alone is not sufficient and its delivery to some internal compartment ( s ) of the endoeytic or perhaps secretory pathway is also required . In any event , it is unlikely that the vacuole must be acidified , because it is known that some yeast mutants remain viable without functional vacu - oles ( Dulfc and Riezman , 1990 ) . Further experiments will be required to determine if there is an organelle whose acidification is essential and , if so , the identity of this or - ganelle .

The End - mutants which are wild - type for u - fatcor uptake ( lO / end134 and 38 / end12 - 1 ) are defective for u - factor degradation . The three time outcrossed mutants 10 ( endl3 - 1 ) ( RH2604 ) ( 13 ) and 38 ( endl2 - 1 ) ( RH2611 ) ( 12 ) and the wild - type strain ( RH144 - 3D ) ( WT ) were assayed for u - factor degradation using a pulse - chase protocol as described in Materials and Methods . Mutant 10 ( end13 - 1 ) degrades the u - factor with slow kinetics , while mutant 38 ( endl2 - 1 ) is nearly completely blocked in u - factor degradation . Quantification of the intact a - factor remaining at different time points by laser densitometry ( using the fluorograms shown ) indicates that in RH144 - 3D only 34 % of the internalized u - factor is intact at 30 min , while in RH2604 and RH2611 , 70 % and 93 % of the internalized u - factor is intact at 30 rain , respectively . By 90 rain , only 7 % of the internalized u - factor is intact in RH144 - 3D , while at the same time 16 % and 64 % of the internalized u - factor is intact in RH2604 and RH2611 , respectively . ( Vsl - ) , we isolated seven new mutants that have endocytic defects . These mutants define six complementation groups ( ENDS - END13 ) . Therefore , it seems likely that more genes required for endocytosis will be identified by further screens for Vsl - mutants . Of the new mutants , four affect uptake of endocytic markers into the cell ( end8 - 1 , end9 - 1 , endlO - 1 , and endll - 1 ) and three may affect subsequent delivery of internal - ized material to the vacuole ( end12 - 1 , end12 - 2 , and endl3 - 1 ) . The uptake - defective mutants are able to deliver and mature the soluble vacuolar protein CPY with wild - type kinetics and do not secrete this protein to the cell surface . In this re - spect , they resemble end3 and end4 mutants . In contrast , the three mutants which may affect subsequent steps in the endo - cytic pathway ( end12 - 1 , endl2 - 2 , and end13 - 1 ) are defective for delivery of newly synthesized CPY to the vacuole . At least a portion of the newly synthesized CPY in these latter mutants reaches the extracellular medium in the p2 form . The secretion of vacuolar hydrolases by endl2 and end13 mutant yeast cells makes the interpretation of the a - factor degradation experiments more difficult . Perhaps these mu - tants are defective in degradation of the internalized a - factor because of a deficiency in vacuolar protease activity and not because of a delay in delivery of u - factor to the vacuole . We believe that there is a delay in a - factor transport to the vacu - ole because the accumulation of LY in the vacuole is also blocked in these mutants . Accumulation of LY in the vacuole does not require vacuolar proteases and several vps mutants which we have tested , including vpsl and vps3 which have strong CPY missorting phenotypes ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) , accumulate LY in the vacuole as well as wild - type cells ( data not shown ) . The slow degradation of or - factor in the end13 - 1 mutant may be consistent with a strong delay in transport of u - factor to the vacuole . This slow degradation is reminiscent of that seen in ypt7mutant yeast and may reflect degradation in a prevacuolar / endosomal compartment in which newly synthesized vacuolar hydrolases accumulate ( Schimmfller and Riezman , 1993 ) . In future experiments we will use cell fractionation techniques to follow the intracellular distribu - tion of c ~ - factor at various times after internalization . These experiments will allow us to determine whether there is a transport block in the endocytic pathway in the end12 / vps34 and endl3 / vps4 mutants and which steps in the endocytic pathway are affected . If there is a defect in transport of u - fac - tor to the vacuole in these mutants , we should be able to identify the compartment in which the or - factor accumulates . The isolation of alleles of vps4 and vps34 in our mutant Figure 6 . Some of the End - mutants are defective in or - factor internalization . Continuous presence c ~ - factor uptake assays were performed at 24°C and at 37°C as described in Materials and Methods on the wild - type strain RHI44 - 3D ( END ) ( shown in each graph A - F ) and the three time outcrossed mutants 19 ( endS - l ) ( RH2607 ) ( A ) , 62 ( end9 - 1 ) ( RH2615 ) ( B ) , 73 ( endlO - 1 ) ( RH2618 ) ( C ) , 82 ( endll - 1 ) ( RH2622 ) ( D ) , 38 ( endl2 - 1 ) ( RH2611 ) ( E ) , and 10 ( end13 - 1 ) ( RH2604 ) ( F ) . Mutants 19 ( endS - l ) and 62 ( end9 - 1 ) ( A and B ) are defective in internalization even at early time points at 37°C , but uptake is less defective ( or not defective ) at 24°C . Mutants 73 ( endlO - 1 ) and 82 ( endll - 1 ) ( C and D ) internalize a - factor like wild - type initially , but then uptake slows down when , ~ 40 - 50 % of the , ~ - factor is internal , i . e . , after 10 - 15 min . Mutants 10 ( endl3 - 1 ) and 38 ( endl2 - 1 ) ( E and F ) internalize u - factor like wild - type at 24°C and 37°C . Data shown is the average of at least four independent assays .

The End - mutants which are defective for u - factor degradation secrete soluble vacuolar proteases . Three time out - crossed mutants 10 ( endl3 - 1 ) ( RH2604 ) , 19 ( endS - l ) ( RH2607 ) , 38 ( endl2 - 1 ) ( RH2611 ) , 62 ( end9 - 1 ) ( RH2615 ) , 73 ( endlO - 1 ) ( RH2618 ) , and 82 ( endll - 1 ) ( RH2622 ) as well as the wild - type strain RH144 - 3D ( END ) and the vpsl strain as a positive control were grown on a nitrocellulose filter at 240C , After two days of growth , the cells were washed from the filter and the filter was probed with antiserum raised against carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) to visualize CPY which had been secreted during growth ( see Materials and Methods ) . The endl2 - 1 and endl3 - 1 mutants are strongly positive , as is the vpsl strain . The endlO - 1 mutant is faintly positive . The endS - l , endg - l , and endll - I mutants are negative like the wild - type strain RH144 - 3D . screen is significant . The vps4 mutants are of the class E type as described by Raymond et al . ( 1992 ) . They have vacuoles of wild - type morphology , however soluble vacuolar proteins such as CPY accumulate in a compartment adjacent to , but distinct from , the vacuole . This " class E compartment " is acidified and the vacuolar H + - ATPase is associated with it . Raymond et al . ( 1992 ) have suggested that it may be an en - dosomal / prevacuolar intermediate lying between the Golgi complex and the vacuole . It is notable also that the renl mu - tant isolated by Davis et al . ( 1993 ) , which exhibits a delay in uptake and / or transport of the a - factor receptor ( Ste3p ) is allelic to vps2 , another class E vps mutant . In contrast to vps4 , vps34 mutants are of the class D type . Class D vps mutants have vacuoles that are often larger than those seen in wild - type cells ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . Never - theless , class D mutants have stronger defects in growth at elevated temperature , growth in high osmolarity medium , and in vacuolar protein sorting compared to class E vps mu - tants . The vacuole is not strongly acidified in these mutants and the vacuoles are not able to segregate efficiently into daughter cells during mitosis ( Banta et al . , 1988 ; Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . A better understanding of the role of the FPS34 gene prod - uct in vacuolar protein sorting has been gained by the discov - ery that it possesses a phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3 - kinase ) activity and has amino acid homology to the catalytic subunit ( pll0 ) of mammalian PI3 - kinase ( Hiles et al . , 1992 ; Herman et al . , 1992 ) . In mammalian cells , PI3 - kinase is as - Figure 9 . All the new End - mutants except 38 ( endl2 ) process soluble vacuolar protease precursors like the wild - type strain RH144 - 3A . Three time outcrossed mutants endS - 1 ( mutant 19 ) ( RI - I2608 ) ( 8 ) , end9 - 1 ( mutant 62 ) ( RH2616 ) ( 9 ) , endlO - 1 ( mutant 73 ) ( RH2619 ) ( 10 ) , endll - 1 ( mutant 82 ) ( RH2623 ) ( 11 ) , end124 ( mutant 38 ) ( RI - I2612 ) ( 12 ) , end134 ( mutant 10 ) ( RH2605 ) ( 13 ) as well as the END strain ( RHI44 - 3A ) ( WT ) were metabolically la - beled with Na235SO4 or with [ 3SS ] methionine and - cysteine at 37°C , and then chased with cold Na235SO4 , methionine , and cys - teine at the same temperature . After various times of chase ( 0 , 5 , 10 , and 30 min ) , samples of cells were removed and protein trans - port was terminated with azide and fluoride . The samples were separated into cellular and extracellular fractions and CPY was im - muneprecipitated from each fraction . The immunecomplexes were resolved on SDS - PAGE gels and the immuneprecipitated CPY was visualized by fluorography . The cellular fractions from each time point are shown on the left , and the extracellular fractions from each time point are shown on the fight , p / is the core - glycosylated ( endoplasmic reticulum ) form of CPY , p2 is the ( outer chain man - nose ) Golgi form of CPY , and m is the mature ( vacuolar ) form of CPY . The large numbers designate the end gene affected , e . g . , 8 is endS - 1 and 9 is endg - 1 , and WT is RH144 - 3A . The endl2 - 1 mu - tant ( 12 ) fails to process CPY to the mature form efficiently and se - cretes the p2 form . All other mutants process CPY with wild - type kinetics . Notice that the endl3 mutant ( 13 ) secretes some p2 CPY as well , in agreement with the results shown in Fig . 8 . The small amount ofpl and p2 CPY present in the extracellular fractions from the wild - type strain and the endg - 1 and endll - 1 strains is probably released by occasional lysis of the labeled cells during sphero - plasting .

In this respect it is interesting that we see no defect in internalization of a - factor in the endl2 - 1 and endl2 - 2 mutants . The defect in endocytosis lies at a later step in the pathway . There are four possible explanations for the defects in the vps34 mutant . ( / ) It is possible that Vps34p is required for budding or transport of vesicles from an endosome / prevacu - olar compartment to the vacuole . This step is probably re - quired for both vacuolar hydrolase delivery and for delivery of endocytosed material to the vacuole . ( 2 ) Vps34p may prin - cipally be involved in targeting of proteins from the Golgi apparatus to endosomes . In this case , a protein that is essen - tial for transport of endocytic material from endosomes to - wards the vacuole would not be delivered to its site of action , and an indirect block of endocytosis would ensue . ( 3 ) Vps34p could be directly required for the recycling of essen - tial Golgi components from endosomes back to the Golgi . This could cause a depletion of the vacuolar protein sorting machinery in the Golgi , and an accumulation of this ma - chinery in endosomes , thus possibly impairing endosomal function . ( 4 ) Vps34p could be working independently in the two pathways , controlling the sorting of vacuolar hydrolases in the Golgi , and the sorting of proteins in endosomes for traffic to different destinations including the plasma mem - brane , Golgi , and the vacuole . Experiments using a vps34 mutant that is temperature - sensitive for function may be valuable in distinguishing between these possibilities . The end12 / vps34 mutations have much stronger effects on maturation of vacuolar hydrolases than the endl3 - 1 mutation , and it may be that the effect ofendl3 - 1 on delivery of vacuolar hydrolases is not direct . For example , the endJ3 - 1 mutation may not affect the compartments through which vacuolar hydrolases pass , but a communicating compartment . A de - fect in the latter compartment may then have a delayed effect on the function of the former compartments and lead to mis - sorting of vacuolar hydrolases . The uptake - defective end mutants can be divided into two classes . One class contains end8 - 1 , endg - 1 , end & and end4 . This class is affected in initial and subsequent uptake ki - netics . A second class of mutant contains the endlO - 1 and endll - 1 mutants . These are affected in uptake of receptor - ligand complexes also , but the defect does not occur immedi - ately after addition of ligand . These mutants show nearly normal initial or - factor uptake kinetics , but uptake appar - ently reaches a plateau after 5 - 10 min of internalization . The first class of mutant is probably directly affected in uptake of ~ t - factor . Several explanations could account for the phenotype of the second class of mutant . ( a ) A component necessary for uptake of a - factor could become depleted shortly after internalization commences . This explanation is unlikely , since fluid - phase endocytosis is also affected in these mutants and it occurs constitutively . ( b ) A block in en - docytic transport to the vacuole from certain intermediate organelles ( e . g . , transfer from early to late endosomes ) might lead to recycling of receptor - ligand complexes from these intermediates back to the surface , thus producing a new equilibrium with approximately equal uptake and recy - cling rates . In support of this proposal , the small amount of internalized o ~ - factor appears not to be degraded with wild - type kinetics in the endll - 1 mutant ( data not shown ) . Further experiments are currently underway to directly address this question . Interestingly , all but one of the mutations isolated on the basis of their Vsl - phenotype segregated in crosses with a tightly linked temperature - sensitive growth phenotype . This Ts - phenotype was most pronounced in end8 - 1 , end9 - 1 , endlO - 1 , endl2 - 1 , and endl2 - 2 , and the cells were unable to grow at all at 37°C . The growth of endl3 - 1 cells was partially impaired at 37°C , and was completely blocked at 39°C . This result extends our previous observation that end3 and end4 mutants were Ts - for growth and supports our speculation that at least one step of the endocytic pathway is essential for growth at elevated temperature . Of the new mutants , only endl ] - I was not strongly defective in growth at high tempera - ture . It remains to be determined whether the defect in end / / - / is partial , or whether ENDll is not essential for growth at elevated temperatures . The ypt7 mutant is not Ts - for growth , even though it has a strong defect in endocytosis ( Wichmann et al . , 1992 ; Schimm611er and Riezman , 1993 ) . This protein seems to act at one of the latest stages of the endocytic pathway : transport out of the late endosome . It could be that late steps are not required for growth at elevated temperature or that the function required for growth at high temperature is provided by another protein in ypt7 mutant strains . The Ts - growth defect exhibited by the new end mutants will allow rapid cloning of the wild - type genes by com - plementation . Further characterization of the mutants de - scribed here and a molecular analysis of the corresponding genes will lead to a greater understanding of the cellular ac - tivities and structures required for endocytosis in yeast .
