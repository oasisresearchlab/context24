Co - development Ventures : Optimal Time of Entry and Proﬁt - Sharing Jakˇsa Cvitani´c ∗ , Sonja Radas † and Hrvoje ˇSiki´c ‡ November 12 , 2008 Abstract We ﬁnd the optimal time for entering a joint venture by two ﬁrms , and the optimal linear contract for sharing the proﬁts . Our dataset shows that in practice , many con - tracts are based on ﬁfty / ﬁfty proﬁt sharing . In our model , that happens in the following cases : symmetric information and contracts which include ﬁxed cash payments ; asym - metric information , ﬁxed cash payments included , and comparable bargaining power of the two ﬁrms ; asymmetric information , ﬁxed cash payments excluded , and one ﬁrm perceives extra beneﬁts from entering the venture . The model predicts that the less experienced ﬁrms are compensated more by royalties and less by equity , which is con - ﬁrmed empirically in the dataset . Overall , the optimal time of entry is quite robust to model speciﬁcations , and the loss of utility of the ﬁrm with less information is not very signiﬁcant when it can dictate the parameters of the linear contract .

These partnerships are working relationships between two or more partners with the goal of cre - ating and delivering a new product , technology or service ( Chesbrough and Schwartz , 2007 ) . While the traditional business model centers on a company which develops a new product in - house ( from own R & D ) and then produces , markets and sells it using its own internal resources , the new model of open innovation includes co - development partnerships . In this way diﬀerent partners’ resources and capabilities can be optimally combined , thus creating signiﬁcant reductions in R & D expense and time to market . According to Quinn ( 2000 ) , using co - development “leading companies have lowered innovation costs and risks by 60 % to 90 % while similarly decreasing cycle time and leveraging their internal investments by tens to hundreds of times” . At the same time , co - development expands the innovation output and helps companies reach new markets that may otherwise be inaccessible . The co - development is especially valuable in industries that are technology - based such as pharmaceuticals , software , comput - ers , telecommunications , etc . Start - up ﬁrms that enter with new technologies and product ideas may be very interested in co - development arrangements , especially in those industries where it is more diﬃcult to bring innovations to market . For a start - up the value of co - development is in access to resources it does not have , while for a large ﬁrm the value lies in harvesting existing innovation and thus extending its product portfolio . Although the large ﬁrm may be very knowledgeable about technology , it will not have the project - speciﬁc knowledge possessed by the project originator ( Pisano , 1997 ) . This asymmetry is then dealt with through contractual terms that are designed to deter shirking , and through selection incentives , such as milestone payments , royalties and other contingent or back - loaded forms of payment to the licensor . In this paper we focus on the co - development alliance between a ﬁrm which is the originator of the project or the new product idea , called ﬁrm S ( for “small” ) and a ﬁrm which provides research and other lacking resources necessary for product development , 1 called ﬁrm L ( for “large” ) . We model the decision to enter co - development using real options theory . In particular we examine how time of entering the alliance depends on availability of information and bargaining power of ﬁrm S . 1 . 1 Theoretical background There are three strands of literature related to our study . The ﬁrst strand relates to ﬁrm alliances . In their quest for eﬃcient operations , ﬁrms increasingly revert to inter - ﬁrm net - working . In particular , in technology - based industries incumbent ﬁrms frequently form strategic alliances with smaller ﬁrms and new entrants ( Gulati , 1998 ; Hagedoorn , 1993 ) . According to Mariti and Smiley ( 1983 ) , Harrigan ( 1985 ) , Porter and Fuller ( 1986 ) , and Hagedoorn and Schakenraad ( 1991 ) , the main motives for collaboration between ﬁrms in - clude sharing of costs / risks , access to partner’s know - how , markets or products , eﬃciency enhancements ( such as economies of scale in production , distribution or R & D , and synergy eﬀects from exchanging or sharing complementary know - how ) , competitive considerations ( such as monitoring or controlling partner’s technology , markets or products , inﬂuencing other alliance activities , and inﬂuencing competitive structure ) and collaborating in order to take advantage of government policy ( such as subsidies ) . In addition to all these , the new trend of collaborating with the aim to produce a technological innovation has been growing stronger ( Veugelers , 1998 ) . Large ﬁrms with hefty R & D budgets and internal R & D capa - bilities have actively used the ”market for know - how” through contractual arrangements to acquire access to new technologies ( Pisano , 1997 ) , while small entrepreneurial ﬁrms seek alliances with large ﬁrms to avail themselves of the resources that are too costly , or too diﬃcult to build internally . In this way , the partners in co - development can make best use of their combined complementary resources . In fact , extant research on the prevalence of motives suggests that exploiting complementarities is a major motive for cooperation in R & D ( Mariti and Smiley , 1983 ; Hagedoorn and Schakenraad , 1991 ) . Teece ( 1986 ) ﬁnds that because of complementarities , the incumbent ﬁrm with competencies in marketing and manufacturing is well positioned to beneﬁt from radical technological change introduced by new entrants . Complementary assets held by incumbents and used in interﬁrm alliances were found to be one of the vehicles of incumbents’ survival in the face of radical technology 2 change ( Tripsas , 1997 ; Rothaermel , 2001 ) . The second strand of literature relates to the contractual arrangements in co - development alliances . Much of the economic modeling literature on company relationships is framed within an agency model ( e . g . Bolton and Dewatripont , 2005 ; Crama et al . , 2007 ) , where asymmetric information and risk aversion are studied as sources of ineﬃciency . Regarding the form that co - development alliances can take , literature identiﬁes two types : joint ven - ture and contractual arrangements . Comino et al ( 2007 ) ﬁnd that the presence of R & D activities in the agenda makes it more likely that the alliances take the form of contrac - tual agreements and this eﬀect gets even stronger when the R & D activities take place in technologically sophisticated sectors . This ﬁnding provides motivation for developing a real option theory of alliances . Contractual arrangements in such alliances usually involve up - front payments and royalties that protect prospective licensee from the risk ; namely when the licensee estimates the risk to be high they can attempt to shift the balance of payments away from up - front fees toward future royalties on end sales and thus transfer the project risk toward the licensor ( Pisano , 1997 ) . Sometimes milestone payments are used for successfully reaching certain stages in product development . Such milestone and royalty contracts arising from asymmetric information have been studied in the literature , dealing with issues of risk sharing between the two ﬁrms ( Amit et al . , 1990 ) , as well as adverse se - lection and moral hazard ( Gallini and Wright , 1990 ; Crama et al . , 2007 ) . Adverse selection occurs because the product originator knows more about the technical characteristics of the product than the large ﬁrm , while moral hazard occurs because the product originator cannot verify how committed the large ﬁrm will be to the development of the product . Savva and Scholtes ( 2007 ) develop a theoretical model that shows how the eﬀect of these ineﬃciencies can be resolved by allowing opt - out options for both parties . The third and last strand of literature relates to the use of real options in modeling interﬁrm alliances . Real options framework recognizes that investment opportunities are options on real assets , and as such is able to provide a way to apply the theory of ﬁnancial options to problems related to ﬁrm’s investment decisions . Most extant literature considers the case of one ﬁrm’s R & D investment decision ( Mitchell and Hamilton 1988 ; McGrath 1997 ; Folta 1998 ) , timing of the investment ( Henderson , 2007 ; Miao and Wang , 2006 ; Dixit 3 and Pindyck , 1994 ) , the development of organizational capabilities ( Kogut and Kulatilaka 2001 ) , and entry decisions ( Miller and Folta 2002 ) . Real options can be also used to model alliances . For example Kogut ( 1991 ) posits that joint ventures could be viewed as real options , where one of the partners can exercise the option to buy equity of the other partner and thus to expand in response to future market and technological developments . Reuer and Tong ( 2005 ) also investigate joint ventures using real options theory . Folta and Miller ( 2002 ) use real options to examine acquisition patterns by pharmaceutical ﬁrms in the biotechnology industry . The authors assume that when an established company holds a minority stake in a new biotechnology ﬁrm , that is equivalent to holding options on a future acquisition ; they proceed to examine under which conditions the established ﬁrm is more likely to exercise the option and to acquire the biotechnology ﬁrm . Comino et al ( 2007 ) ﬁnd that alliances that involve R & D ( like co - development alliances ) are more likely to take the form that can be described using the theory of real options . Ziedonis ( 2007 ) examines the use of options contracts by ﬁrms acquiring rights to commercialize university technologies , and ﬁnds that ﬁrms are more likely to purchase option contracts for more uncertain technologies , and the ﬁrms that are better able to evaluate an external technology are less likely to purchase options before licensing . 1 . 2 Aims and contributions Our paper follows a real options approach in modeling the decision to form co - development alliance . Methodologically , we use the theory of the optimal stopping of diﬀusion processes . Classical references of its applications in economics include McDonald and Siegel ( 1986 ) and the book Dixit and Pindyck ( 1994 ) , where this theory was shown to be extremely useful for problems involving real options , and in particular for the option of entering and / or exiting a project . For a very general recent mathematical treatment of such problems , see Johnson and Zervos ( 2008 ) . The latter work also shows how to reduce mixed entry and exit problems with intertemporal proﬁt / loss rate to standard optimal stopping problems , a ”trick” we ﬁnd useful in this paper , too . Our methodological contributions consist of the following : ( i ) We add to the real options literature by modeling two companies deciding on entry time , instead of only one company 4 performing the optimization over possible times of entry ( the existing real options literature mostly deals with the latter case ) . When ﬁnding the optimal time of initiating a project , we consider ﬁrst the case of symmetric information between the two ﬁrms , and we ﬁnd the Pareto optimal time , that is we maximize a linear combination of the two ﬁrms’ objectives . This can be interpreted in two ways , as maximizing the social welfare , but it is also the commonly accepted mechanism in contract theory for proﬁt sharing between two economic agents with symmetric information . For a ﬁxed value of a parameter representing the relative bargaining power , in addition to the optimal entry time , this procedure determines the optimal parameters of the contract . Thus , the actual level of sharing depends on the bargaining power . Next , we examine the case when information is asymmetric . In this case , it is standard to suppose that the ﬁrm with more information can choose from a menu of contracts , which will induce it to reveal the information . We assume that letting ﬁrm S choose the timing will induce it to reveal indirectly the information it has . Thus , in our model the company with more information decides on the initiation time , while the other company decides on how to share the proﬁts , while satisfying the participation constraint of the former company . ( ii ) We model the risk attitudes in more general terms than is typical . We assume that the companies are potentially risk averse , while in the literature they are usually risk neutral . However , we use ﬂexible risk aversion functions which can approximate the case of risk - neutrality , as close as desired . In any case , qualitatively , the results are not very sensitive to the choice of risk aversion . ( iii ) The suﬃcient conditions of Johnson and Zervos ( 2008 ) are not satisﬁed in our model , so we prove from the scratch that the same method works . Basically , we show that the usual way of ﬁnding the optimal entry time works in a model in which the value of the project follows an arithmetic Brownian motion , while the risk preferences are described by exponential utility functions ; or , equivalently from the mathematical point of view , the value of the project follows a geometric Brownian motion , while the risk preferences are described by power utility functions . Our model allows us to determine optimal entry times and optimal linear contracts , and to explore how these diﬀer between the cases of symmetric vs . asymmetric information . We also investigate the relationship between the optimal entry times , the parameters of the op - timal contract and the relative bargaining power of the ﬁrms . The main theoretical ﬁndings 5 are : ( i ) a number of model speciﬁcations results in the ( approximately ) equal percentage sharing of proﬁts , consistent with the real life data in the pharmaceutical / biotechnology ventures in our dataset ; ( ii ) the optimal time of entry is not overly sensitive to the model speciﬁcations ; ( iii ) the utility loss of the ﬁrm with less information is not signiﬁcantly larger than when the information is symmetric ( for most values of the bargaining power ) ; ( iv ) the ﬁrms with lower bargaining power are compensated more by royalties and less by equity ( this is true both in the model and in the dataset ) ; ( v ) changing the model parameters , and , in particular , the risk aversion parameters of the ﬁrms , does not change the above qualitative conclusions . Section 2 describes the model and basic mathematical techniques for solving the entry problem in the presence of one ﬁrm only . In Section 3 we solve for the optimal linear contract between two ﬁrms , for symmetric and for asymmetric information case . We discuss comparative statics in Section 4 , and in Section 5 we examine the agreement of those theoretical predictions with empirical facts implied from a dataset of real world alliances . Section 6 concludes . 2 Method for ﬁnding the optimal entry time In this section we describe a methodology for ﬁnding the optimal entry time in a general formulation . The technique is familiar from the optimal stopping theory and its applications in the theory of real options , and has recently been analyzed in a very general context by Johnson and Zervos ( 2008 ) . We follow closely their approach , but our special case does not satisfy their general assumptions , so we derive everything from the scratch . Moreover , our project may have a ﬁnite deterministic duration , while they have either inﬁnite duration or an optimally chosen exit time . There are two ﬁrms , S ( for “small” ) and L ( for “large” ) . We think of ﬁrm L as a pharmaceutical company which wants to co - develop a new product jointly with its inventor , ﬁrm S , which is an R & D ﬁrm . After entering a co - development project at time τ , they share future proﬁt / loss up to time τ + T . Here , T is the time horizon , and all the results hold for T = ∞ , too . The proﬁt / loss process is a function of the state process X , following 6 a Stochastic Diﬀerential Equation ( SDE ) dX t = bX t dt + σX t dW t where b , σ are constants and W is a Brownian motion process . Let us consider the problem of when to enter the project from a point of view of one decision maker . All our problems will reduce to this case , as we will either have to maximize the combined objectives of the two ﬁrms when they have the same information , or else , in the case of asymmetric information , only one ﬁrm will be making the entry decision . By deﬁnition , the optimal entry time is obtained by maximizing over stopping times τ an expression of the form E x (cid:183) 1 { τ < ∞ } (cid:181)(cid:90) τ + T τ e − rt h ( X t ) dt + e − rτ h 1 ( X τ ) (cid:182)(cid:184) ( 2 . 1 ) Here , r is a discount rate , h ( X t ) will represent the utility ( or a combination of utilities of two ﬁrms ) obtained from the future proﬁt / loss rate , and h 1 ( X t ) is initial utility ( or a combination of utilities ) . Although our main methodological theorem in Appendix covers a more general case , in this paper we will only consider functions h , h 1 of the form h ( x ) = I (cid:88) i = 1 [ k i + l i x γ i / γ i ] , h 1 ( x ) = I (cid:88) i = 1 [ k 1 , i + l 1 , i x γ i / γ i ] Note that these are linear combinations of concave increasing functions , where γ i < 1 will reﬂect the degree of risk aversions . 1 Denote β : = 2 b / σ 2 , n : = 1 / 2 − β / 2 + (cid:112) ( β / 2 − 1 / 2 ) 2 + 2 r / σ 2 and θ i : = θ ( γ i ) = r − γ 2 i σ 2 / 2 − γ i ( b − σ 2 / 2 ) 1 We could have a diﬀerent number of terms in the two sums by having some of the coeﬃcients equal to zero . 7 We assume throughout this paper that r > b This implies n > 1 , and guarantees that the optimization problem does not explode when T = ∞ . Moreover , we also assume that l i + l 1 , i ≥ 0 , that at least one of the terms [ l i + l 1 , i ] is strictly positive , and that , for those i with [ l i + l 1 , i ] > 0 we have that all γ i are of the same sign and γ i (cid:88) j [ k r j + k 1 , j ] < 0 , θ i > 0 . These inequalities will guarantee that it is not optimal to start at time zero , and that it is not optimal never to enter the project . 2 Denote R h ( x ) : = E x (cid:90) T 0 e − rs h ( X s ) ds We show in Lemma 7 . 1 in Appendix that the problem of maximizing ( 2 . 1 ) is equivalent to the maximization problem w ( x ) : = sup τ E x (cid:163) 1 { τ < ∞ } e − rτ [ R h ( X τ ) + h 1 ( X τ ) ] (cid:164) ( 2 . 2 ) We can compute R h ( x ) = (cid:88) i [ k ri + l θ i i x γ i γ i ] where k ri = k i 1 − e − rT r l θ i i : = l i 1 − e − θ i T θ i 2 It is not hard to construct examples , for example with I = 1 , which show that if these conditions are not satisﬁed , we can have optimal τ equal to zero or inﬁnity . 8 Denote also g ( x ) : = R h ( x ) + h 1 ( x ) We can then write g ( x ) = I (cid:88) i = 1 [ k ri + k 1 , i ] + I (cid:88) i = 1 [ l θ i i + l 1 , i ] x γ i / γ i According to Theorem 7 . 1 and subsection 7 . 1 in Appendix , the optimal time of entry is the ﬁrst time process X hits the point ˆ x that is determined from the equation ng ( ˆ x ) = ˆ xg (cid:48) ( ˆ x ) ( 2 . 3 ) or (cid:88) i [ k ri + k 1 , i ] = I (cid:88) i = 1 [ l θ i i + l 1 , i ] (cid:181) 1 n − 1 γ i (cid:182) ˆ x γ i ( 2 . 4 ) We will be solving this equation numerically , except in the case I = 1 in which it is easily veriﬁed that ˆ x γ = γ θ l + l 1 θ k / r + k 1 γ / n − 1 ( 2 . 5 ) Remark 2 . 1 For γ < 0 , write 1 γ x γ = 1 γ e γ log ( x ) Then , we can interpret log ( X t ) as the proﬁt / loss rate , and e γx / γ as a utility function , and we can still use all the results from above . This is exactly what we will do next . 3 Proﬁt / Risk sharing : optimal contracts between two ﬁrms In addition to deciding on the time of entry , the two ﬁrms have to decide how to share the proﬁts / losses . We will consider two cases , symmetric and asymmetric information . 3 . 1 Symmetric information : maximizing joint welfare Denote by P t = P ( X t ) the total proﬁt / loss rate to the two ﬁrms S and L , and by U L , U S , u L , u S , the utility functions of the ﬁrms . For a given λ > 0 , the proﬁt - sharing , or the risk - sharing problem with symmetric information is to maximize , over entry time τ , initial 9 payoﬀ C τ and payment rate c t from ﬁrm L to ﬁrm S , the value E x (cid:183) 1 { τ < ∞ } (cid:181)(cid:90) τ + T τ e − rt [ U L ( P t − c t ) + λU S ( c t ) ] dt + e − rτ [ u L ( P τ − C τ ) + λu S ( C τ ) ] (cid:182)(cid:184) ( 3 . 6 ) In other words , we maximize a weighted sum of the expected utilities of the two ﬁrms , where the weight λ is interpreted as the bargaining power of ﬁrm S relative to ﬁrm S . This is the standard contract theory approach for ﬁnding optimal contracts between two entities in the case of symmetric information ( see Bolton and Dewatripont 2005 ) . By maximizing inside the integral with respect to c t , we see that the ﬁrst order condition for optimality of c t is the classical Borch ( 1962 ) condition for risk sharing : U (cid:48) L ( P t − c t ) = λU (cid:48) S ( c t ) The optimal payment c t from the L to S is the solution to this equation . In particular , if the utility functions are exponential , U i ( x ) = k i + l i γ i e γ i x ( 3 . 7 ) then the optimal c t is linear , c t = c + aP t ( 3 . 8 ) for constants a = γ L γ L + γ S , c = − log ( λl S / l L ) / ( γ L + γ S ) Completely analogous discussion holds for the initial payment C τ 1 . In particular , if we assume u i ( x ) = k i 1 + l i 1 γ i e γ i x , then a linear initial contract C τ = c 1 + aP τ is optimal , with c 1 = − log ( λl S 1 / l L 1 ) / ( γ L + γ S ) . In this derivation , there are no limited liability constraints , that is , there is no lower bound on the payments . Thus , c t and C τ may take negative values , and ﬁrm S may have to pay cash payments to the large ﬁrm . That rarely , if ever , happens in practice . One not 10 unreasonable way to avoid that , is to posit that only the contracts of the form c t = aP t , C τ = a 1 P τ ( 3 . 9 ) are used . This may be justiﬁed by the fact that most of the compensation is based on future royalties plus milestone payments , and on initial cash plus equity payment . More precisely , we can consider contracts of the form ( 3 . 9 ) with the interpretation that the royalties , milestone payments and possibly the additional investments of ﬁrm S into the project are lumped together into c t = aP t , while the initial cash plus equity is represented by C τ = a 1 P τ . The justiﬁcation for the latter comes from the empirical fact that the size of the initial cash amount observed in the data depends on the phase of the product , thus it is not unappropriate to model it as proportional to process P t . After concentrating our attention ﬁrst to the simple payments as in ( 3 . 9 ) , we then will perform also a maximization allowing non - zero cash payments c and c 1 , for the contracts of the form c t = aP t + c , C τ = a 1 P τ + c 1 ( 3 . 10 ) For the payments as in ( 3 . 9 ) , the problem of obtaining the Pareto optimal risk - sharing is to maximize V P : = E X 0 (cid:183) 1 { τ < ∞ } (cid:90) τ + T τ e − rt [ U L ( ( 1 − a ) P t ) + λU S ( aP t ) ] dt (cid:184) + E X 0 (cid:163) 1 { τ < ∞ } e − rτ [ u L ( ( 1 − a 1 ) P τ ) + λu S ( a 1 P τ ) ] (cid:164) ( 3 . 11 ) Here , we take P t = log ( X t ) and the utility functions as U i ( x ) = k i + l i γ i e γ i x , u i ( x ) = k i 1 + l i 1 γ i e γ i x , i = S , L Denote g ( x , a , a 1 ) = k rL + λk rS + k L , 1 + λk S , 1 + l θ ( [ 1 − a ] γ L ) L x [ 1 − a ] γ L γ L + l 1 , L x [ 1 − a 1 ] γ L γ L + λl θ ( aγ S ) S x aγ S γ S + λl 1 , S x a 1 γ S γ S 11 Let the time of entry τ be the ﬁrst time process X hits a value x . From the standard results on Brownian hitting times , we get , for X 0 ≤ x , E X 0 (cid:163) 1 { τ < ∞ } e − rτ (cid:164) = (cid:181) X 0 x (cid:182) n ( 3 . 12 ) Thus , from ( 2 . 2 ) , the expression in ( 3 . 11 ) is given by V P ( a , a 1 , x ) = g ( x , a , a 1 ) (cid:181) X 0 x (cid:182) n We will maximize this numerically over ( a , a 1 , x ) ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] × [ 0 , 1 ] × R + . We will also compute the expected utilities of the ﬁrms S and L . Denote g S ( a , a 1 , x ) = [ k r S + k S , 1 ] + l θ ( aγ S ) S 1 γ S x aγ S + l 1 , S 1 γ S x a 1 γ S g L ( a , a 1 , x ) = [ k L r + k L , 1 ] + l θ ( [ 1 − a ] γ L ) L 1 γ L x [ 1 − a ] γ L + l 1 , L 1 γ L x [ 1 − a 1 ] γ L Then , the corresponding expected utilities are given by V S ( ˆ a , ˆ a 1 , ˆ x ) = g S ( ˆ a , ˆ a 1 , ˆ x ) (cid:181) X 0 ˆ x (cid:182) n V L ( ˆ a , ˆ a 1 , ˆ x ) : = g L ( ˆ a , ˆ a 1 , ˆ x ) (cid:181) X 0 ˆ x (cid:182) n where ( ˆ a , ˆ a 1 , ˆ x ) are optimal for maximizing V P ( a , a 1 , x ) . Similar computations can be done in case of the contracts as in ( 3 . 10 ) . 3 . 2 Asymmetric information : ﬁrm S decides on entry time , ﬁrm L de - cides on payoﬀ structure We now assume that ﬁrm S decides on the starting time of the joint venture , while ﬁrm L decides on the form of the contract payoﬀ . An economic interpretation is the following : suppose ﬁrm S has information about the quality of the product which is not revealed to ﬁrm L until they start the joint venture . In this case the standard contract theory approach is that ﬁrm S with more information can choose from a menu of contracts , each one aimed 12 at a ﬁrm S with a speciﬁc quality of the product . Moreover , the contracts in the menu are structured so that ﬁrm S reveals the product’s quality ( this is called the “revelation principle” , see Bolton and Dewatripont 2005 ) . We assume that letting ﬁrm S decide when to start the venture will induce it not to misrepresent the quality . Arguably , in practice it is , indeed , often ﬁrm S which decides when to ”put itself on the market” . In accordance with the above assumptions , at the moment τ of initiating the joint venture , we suppose that the quality of the project is revealed to ﬁrm L , that is , X τ and the parameters b and σ are known . However , ﬁrm L does not know whether ﬁrm S has been waiting , or whether it just has completed the product in a manner suitable for co - development . Consistent with this , we assume that the contract cannot penalize ﬁrm S for having waited . Moreover , again in accordance with the standard contract theory approach , we suppose that ﬁrm L , that is , the ﬁrm with less information , decides on the form of the contract payoﬀ , i . e . on the structure of the menu of contracts . We assume exponential utility functions as above , and again we ﬁrst consider the contract payoﬀs of the linear form , c t = aP t , C τ = a 1 P τ Firm L has to choose a and a 1 maximizing her utility while satisfying the “participation constraint” that ﬁrm S ’s utility has to be no less than a given constant R ( “reservation utility” ) , which may depend on the revealed X τ , b , σ . So , suppose that ﬁrm S can expect the contract as above , given that it will be revealed that the quality is ( X τ , b , σ ) . Thus , ﬁrm S maximizes , over stopping times τ , V S ( τ ) : = E x (cid:183) 1 { τ < ∞ } (cid:181)(cid:90) τ + T τ e − rt U S ( aP t ) dt + e − rτ u S ( a 1 P τ ) (cid:182)(cid:184) ( 3 . 13 ) From Theorem 7 . 1 in Appendix it is easy to check that the optimal starting point x S is determined as a solution x = x S to k S r + k S , 1 = l θ ( aγ S ) S (cid:181) a n − 1 γ S (cid:182) x aγ S + l 1 , S (cid:181) a 1 n − 1 γ S (cid:182) x a 1 γ S ( 3 . 14 ) 13 Recall that the utility of ﬁrm L is given by V L ( a , a 1 , x S ) = g L ( x S ) (cid:181) X 0 x S (cid:182) n For a given ﬁxed R , ﬁrm L needs to maximize V L over ( a , a 1 , x S ) so that the constraint ( 3 . 14 ) is satisﬁed , and so that the ﬁrm S utility V S , given by ( 3 . 13 ) , is no smaller than R . We report on the conclusions coming from our numerical computations in a section below , as well as on the case when the payments are of the form ( 3 . 10 ) . 3 . 3 Value of the option to enter the project Our framework provides also a way of deciding the value of the option to enter the project , which we sketch now . Since our ﬁrms are risk averse , we use the concept of certainty equivalent to determine that value . Consider a ﬁrm whose utility V ( x ) , where x = X 0 , can be written as V ( x ) = E x (cid:183) 1 { τ < ∞ } (cid:181)(cid:90) τ + T τ e − rt U ( P t ) dt + e − rτ u ( P τ ) (cid:182)(cid:184) Deﬁne the constant rate of payments q and value p such that U ( q ) 1 − e − rT r = E x (cid:183) 1 { τ < ∞ } (cid:90) τ + T τ e − rt U ( P t ) dt (cid:184) u ( p ) = E x (cid:163) 1 { τ < ∞ } e − rτ u ( P τ ) (cid:164) In other words , if we replaced P t with a constant q , and if the starting time was zero , the ﬁrm would be getting the same utility from the integral part as under the actual dynamics of P and the actual starting time . Similarly for the initial utility . Then , we introduce the value of the option to enter the project , denoted v , as v = q 1 − e − rT r + p This procedure can be used for valuing projects of the type we study in this paper . 14 4 Comparative Statics Having developed the above framework , we can now compute the optimal entry points and the optimal contract for various parameters of the model . Our benchmark case has the following parameters , in annual terms : X 0 = 0 . 1 , γ S = γ L = − 1 , r = 0 . 1 , b = 0 . 07 , σ = 0 . 35 , T = 5 , 1 = k i = l i = k i , 1 = l i , 1 In particular , the two ﬁrms have the same risk aversions in the computations , unless we say otherwise . The choice of parameters r , b , σ and T is in agreement with the real world examples . The choice of X 0 = 1 is a normalization , as is the choice of l i , l i 1 . The values of k i , k i 1 are chosen so that the utility of zero proﬁt is zero , the same as if never entering the venture . The choice of the risk aversions γ i is quite arbitrary , but it turns out that the main qualitative conclusions are not sensitive to the values of these parameters , as reported below . All the graphs have log λ as the variable on the x - axis , where λ is the “bargaining power” parameter from the symmetric information problem ( 3 . 11 ) . When we deal with the asymmetric information case , we need to ﬁx reservation utility R of ﬁrm S , and we take those values of R = R ( λ ) that come from the computations in the symmetric information case . 4 . 1 Case I : symmetric information Figure 1 shows the required initial proﬁt rate level log X τ for the Pareto optimal case of maximizing the joint welfare under symmetric information as in ( 3 . 11 ) , and also when each ﬁrm optimizes its own utility . 15 (cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0) Desired Profit Level 0 . 7 0 . 71 0 . 72 0 . 73 0 . 74 0 . 75 0 . 76 0 . 77 - 0 . 6 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 log lambda I n i t i a l p r o f i t Large firm Small Firm (cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0) Joint Welfare Figure 1 : Optimal initial profit levels With larger bargaining power , that is , larger λ , ﬁrm S fares better and thus wants to enter the co - development earlier , while ﬁrm L wants to wait . Smaller λ favors ﬁrm L which therefore wants to enter early , while ﬁrm S prefers to wait . The initial optimal proﬁt rates when own expected utility is maximized are diﬀerent for ﬁrm S and ﬁrm L , and the initial proﬁt rate optimal for joint welfare takes a compromise value between the two . In case of equal bargaining power ( log ( λ ) = 0 ) , ﬁrm S and ﬁrm L agree on the same initial proﬁt rate and therefore on the same time of entry into the alliance . This is also the Pareto optimal time which guarantees optimal joint welfare . Next , we investigate the properties of the contract deﬁned by “royalty” percentage a and upfront , “equity” percentage a 1 . ( Let us recall the interpretation of a 1 , which , in addition to equity , may include cash payments proportional to the phase of the project . ) The symmetric information case , with no ﬁxed cash payments allowed , is shown in Figure 2 . 16 (cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0) Proportions a and a1 : symmetric information (cid:1) 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 - 0 . 6 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 log lambda P r opo r t i on s " a " (cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0) " a1 " Figure 2 : Proportions paid to firm S Both the royalty and the equity percentage payment become larger as the bargaining power of ﬁrm S increases . We ﬁnd that when the bargaining power of ﬁrm S is low , the equity percentage payment should be lower than royalty ( i . e . a 1 < a ) , and when ﬁrm S has high bargaining power , the equity percentage payment should be higher than royalty ( i . e . a 1 > a ) . Thus for a ﬁrm with very small bargaining power which can share information perfectly ( probably at the very early stage of development ) , we would expect to see that it is compensated mostly by payment in royalties and that it is receiving low equity payment . This is , indeed , conﬁrmed empirically by the data , as we report later in Section 5 . The case when the ﬁxed cash payments ( corresponding to parameters c and c 1 ) are allowed is shown in Figure 7 below . 4 . 2 Case II : asymmetric information As discussed above , symmetric information is not very likely in the real world co - development decisions . The project originator , ﬁrm S , typically has more information about the project than the partner ﬁrm L . Therefore , we consider implications of our model in the situation of asymmetric information where ﬁrm L decides on the contract form , while ﬁrm S decides on when to enter the alliance . We again assume that both ﬁrms have the same risk aversion , and the same parameters as above . 17 4 . 2 . 1 No ﬁxed cash payments First , we consider the contracts of the form c t = aP t C τ = a 1 P τ We look at how large is relative loss in expected utility of ﬁrm L , relative to the case of symmetric information , if we ﬁx the expected utility of ﬁrm S at the same level as in the case of symmetric information . Relative Loss in firm L utility - 0 . 0005 0 0 . 0005 0 . 001 0 . 0015 0 . 002 0 . 0025 0 . 003 0 . 0035 - 0 . 6 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 log lambda P e r ce n t a g e Lo ss Figure 3 : Relative utility loss for firm L with asymmetric information . The relative loss is presented in Figure 3 , and we can see there is an asymmetry , it is higher when the bargaining power of ﬁrm S is low than when it is high , and it is very low for comparable bargaining powers ( in fact , there is no loss when the bargaining powers are the same ) . Overall , however , the percentage utility loss of ﬁrm L due to asymmetric information is not very high . We also look , in Figure 4 , at the ratio of the ( exponential of ) required initial proﬁt rate x S , which ﬁrm S chooses when the information is asymmetric , and the ( exponential of ) compromise initial proﬁt rate from the symmetric information case . 18 Ratio of initial x values 0 . 98 0 . 99 1 1 . 01 1 . 02 1 . 03 1 . 04 1 . 05 1 . 06 - 0 . 6 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 log lambda ' R a t i o Figure 4 : Ratio of initial X values , asymmetric relative to symmetric information case . We observe that , when its bargaining power is high , ﬁrm S tends to enter earlier , relative to the case of perfect information , and vice - versa when its bargaining power is low . However , overall the change in the starting point is not very signiﬁcant – the time of entry is similar to the one with symmetric information . When information becomes asymmetric , the optimal choice of a and a 1 is qualitatively the same as with symmetric information , as shown in Figure 5 . Proportions a and a1 : asymmetric information 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 - 0 . 6 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 log lambda P r opo r t i on s " a " " a1 " Figure 5 : Proportions paid to firm S . One diﬀerence is that the slope is smaller , that is , the percentages paid to ﬁrm S are less sensitive to its bargaining power in the presence of asymmetric information . For completeness , we now report on the comparative statics we obtained when varying diﬀerent parameters . We save on space and provide no graphs here , the reason being that 19 the eﬀects of changing the parameters are not very signiﬁcant . Varying b . It has been stated that project quality is one of the crucial factors in decision to enter co - development ( Pisano , 1997 ) . Thus , we explore how project quality measured by b impacts the terms of the contract ( i . e . a and a 1 ) , in the benchmark case . We ﬁnd that overall a and a 1 do not change much when project quality b changes , which indicates that the contract oﬀered is quite robust to the project quality . What changes is the time of entry – ﬁrm S enters later with higher b , waiting for the level of initial proﬁts to reach a higher level . However , the relative ratio of initial entry levels between symmetric and asymmetric information case does not change much with project quality b , although , with asymmetric information , with higher b ﬁrm S waits a bit longer , relative to the symmetric information case , when it has low bargaining power , and waits relatively less with high bargaining power . Although these eﬀects are small in magnitude , their existence is not inconsistent with the lemon hypothesis from Pisano ( 1997 ) . Pisano postulates that market for co - development projects functions in a similar way as the market for used cars described by Akerloﬀ ( 1970 ) where asymmetric information and presence of low quality products drive everyone’s price down to the level where only bad products remain in the market . In the co - development situation the inability of the licensor partner to accurately assess the project quality should cause only low quality projects to become collaborative and good quality projects to be retained and subsequently developed by the idea originator alone . Our model shows that the idea originator indeed may have a good reason for being reluctant to join forces with another ﬁrm when information is asymmetric and its bargaining power is low : in that case the ﬁrm with a high quality project optimally waits longer . Varying σ . Qualitatively , no big changes occur . As could be expected , higher σ means waiting longer to enter . Proportions a and a 1 get less steep , higher on the low bargaining power side , and lower on the high side . Varying risk aversions γ i . Again , qualitatively , no big changes occur . As could be expected , with higher risk aversion γ S , a and a 1 become lower , and the time of entry is later . 20 Varying k S . In the benchmark case that we discussed up to now we chose the param - eters so that the utility of receiving zero proﬁts is equal to zero , which is also the utility of never entering the project . However , in reality there might be extra costs or extra beneﬁts of being involved in the project , other than the pure proﬁt / loss ﬂow . For example , Nichol - son et al ( 2003 ) ﬁnd that inexperienced biotech companies tend to sign the ﬁrst deals with large pharma companies on terms that are less than optimal for them , but the deal itself acts as a signal to potential investors and the rest of the community about the quality of the project and the company . The discount in the deal can be considered as a payment to the pharma company for the evaluation that it performs . Although the value of the project itself is sometimes diﬃcult to disclose fully , the quality of the project - originating ﬁrm is easier to communicate . In the current model , when information is asymmetric , ﬁrm S with low bargaining power tends to wait relatively longer to enter the alliance , and more so when it is of high quality . This actually supports the argument by Nicholson et al ( 2003 ) , as ﬁrm S would beneﬁt from revealing the information in order to get better future deals by signaling quality through the alliance . We can model this situation assuming that ﬁrm S achieves extra utility from entering the alliance , for example through the change of the values of k and l - type parameters in the utility functions . One such case is depicted in Figure 6 , where k S is higher than the benchmark value . Figure 6 shows that in that case contracts with ”sticky” royalties happen . By sticky royalties we mean those royalties that vary in a narrow range . a and a1 : asymmetric information , extra future benefit 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 - 0 . 6 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 log lambda P r opo r t i on s " a " " a1 " Figure 6 : Proportions paid to firm S when " k _ S " = 1 . 19 21 We see that with this higher value of k S both royalties and equity payments do not vary much when ﬁrm S bargaining power is low . This means that the contract oﬀered by ﬁrm L will be almost the same for partner ﬁrms with diﬀerent degrees of bargaining power , as long as the latter is low . The percentage from the future income ( royalty a ) hovers around 50 % , while the percentage of the current value of the ﬁrm ( equity payment a 1 ) starts at zero and stays there for a while . We examine below the agreement of these theoretical predictions with real data . Unlike in the benchmark case , ﬁrm S perceives a greater beneﬁt of creating a partner - ship , and , because of that , it enters the joint venture very early ( the values of required proﬁt log x S , not reported , are quite lower than in the benchmark case ) . Because of the perceived high beneﬁt for ﬁrm S , it is easier for ﬁrm L to satisfy the participation constraint of ﬁrm S , that is , to pay at least the reservation wage . In fact , for low bargaining power of ﬁrm S , ﬁrm L is willing to pay more than the reservation wage , by pushing up the value of a to around 50 % ( while keeping a 1 at or close to zero ) . Thus the participation constraint is not actually binding in this range , and the optimum clusters around similar values of a and a 1 ( and x S , not reported ) . With higher bargaining power , however , the reservation wage binds , and the higher utility for ﬁrm S comes mostly from a sharp increase in equity payments . 4 . 2 . 2 Fixed cash payments included It can be argued that the contracts of the type c t = aP t , C τ = a 1 P τ may not be the most eﬃcient theoretically . Instead it would be more eﬃcient to have contracts of the form c t = aP t + c C τ = a 1 P τ + c 1 ( 4 . 15 ) with c representing the future cash payments , and c 1 representing the initial cash payment . We do that next . For the case ( 4 . 15 ) , we present the optimal values in Figure 7 , with symmetric informa - tion , and in Figure 8 , with asymmetric information . 22 (cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0) a , a1 , c , c1 and x : symmetric information (cid:1) - 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 - 0 . 6 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 log lambda p r opo r t i on s (cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0) " a " " a _ 1 " " c " (cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0)(cid:0) " c1 " " x " Figure 7 : Optimal contract and initial value with symmetric information and four parameters With symmetric information , we observe the following . Percentages a and a 1 are almost the same , and always around 50 % . Cash payments c and c 1 are also almost the same , and they increase , starting from negative values for low bargaining power of ﬁrm S . The negative values mean that ﬁrm S pays . For example , it could be required to invest certain amount of cash in the co - development , for instance by paying salaries of additional employees . On the other hand , in addition to compensating ﬁrms S with cash , ﬁrm L could be investing some of its resources ( people , equipment ) into the project , which would be an example of positive c , c 1 . Presumably , in practice ﬁrm S typically does not have higher bargaining power than ﬁrm L , which means that it would be required to make cash payments , which is not observed in the data . This is perhaps either because a limited liability constraint is adopted , that is , the payment to ﬁrm S is required to be non - negative , or it pays indirectly , by additional investments into the project . Let us also mention that Figure 7 also shows that the time of entry in the project ( corresponding to value X τ = x ) , changes very little with bargaining power . 23 a , a1 , c , c1 : assymetric information - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 - 0 . 6 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 log lambda P r opo r t i on s " a " " a1 " " c " " c1 " Figure 8 : Proportions and cash payments with asymmetric information With asymmetric information and four contract parameters a , a 1 , c , c 1 we see from Fig - ure 8 that the situation changes quite a bit . The parameters a and a 1 diﬀer more among themselves , as do c and c 1 . Values of a are less “sticky” than with symmetric information , but more than with two parameter contracts ( Figure 5 . ) For high bargaining power of ﬁrm S , the ﬁrm gets paid the maximum initial percentage a 1 , but , in return , it has to make initial cash payments to ﬁrm L , unlike in the symmetric information case where payments were received by ﬁrm S with high bargaining power . Assuming that in practice we are mostly in the low range of bargaining power for ﬁrm S , we could expect to see some initial positive cash payments to it . ( In fact , we do see them , but it is hard to distinguish between those which are ﬁxed cash payments and those which are a function of the stage of the project when the joint venture is entered . ) Actually , it might be argued that what we see in Figure 8 on the low , but not too low bargaining power side , is what we see in many biothech / pharma co - development alliances : c close to zero – no future cash payments , c 1 positive – some initial cash payments , a close to 50 % – equal split of royalties , a 1 positive – some initial payment in equity . Let us also mention , without providing a graph , that , relative to the symmetric information case , in this regime , the ﬁrm S waits longer with low bargaining power and less with high bargaining power . However , these deviations are not of signiﬁcant size – the time of entry is not that far from one with symmetric information . 24 Varying b , 4 parameters . We ﬁnd that with lower b : - a is lower than with higher b for low bargaining power , and higher for higher bargaining power . Same for a 1 , except the eﬀect is visible only when the bargaining power of the two ﬁrms is similar . - initial cash payment c is higher , while the future cash payment c 1 is lower ( no matter which party pays ) . - the ﬁrm S enters sooner , and otherwise the timing eﬀects are as in the case with two parameter contracts . Varying σ , 4 parameters . We ﬁnd that with higher σ : - a is higher than with lower σ for low bargaining power , and lower for higher bargaining power . a 1 is lower , but the eﬀect is visible only when the bargaining power of the two ﬁrms is similar . - c is lower than with lower σ for low bargaining power , and higher for higher bargaining power . Other way round for c 1 . - as could be expected , higher σ means waiting longer to enter . - relative ratio of initial entry levels becomes lower , for low bargaining power , and higher , for high bargaining power . Varying risk aversions γ i , 4 parameters . As could be expected , with lower risk aversion γ S , a and a 1 become higher . So does c 1 , while c becomes lower on the low bargaining side . The time of entry does not change much . It is later for low bargaining side and sooner for high bargaining side . Relative ratio of initial entry levels is higher for low bargaining side and lower for high bargaining side . Finally , we also graph the loss relative to the full information case and the ratio of initial x values . 25 Relative Loss in firm L utility - 0 . 05 0 0 . 05 0 . 1 0 . 15 0 . 2 0 . 25 0 . 3 0 . 35 - 0 . 6 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 log lambda P e r ce n t a g e Lo ss Figure 9 : Relative utility loss for firm L with asymmetric information , 4 parameters .

Qualitatively , the shape does not change much relative to the case of no ﬁxed cash payments . However , the relative loss is signiﬁcantly higher when the bargaining power of ﬁrm S is high . Similarly , the ratio of entry time levels is lower for the high bargaining power , although , there is less variation with similar bargaining power . 26 5 Empirical results In this section we check some qualitative features of our model against the real world data . We use the data on alliances from Recombinant Capital ( www . recap . com ) . We choose the alliances classiﬁed as co - developments where the R & D originator is a biotech ﬁrm and the other partner is a pharmaceutical ﬁrm . We allow that the alliance , in addition to co - development , includes other activities such as licensing , co - marketing , etc . Our database spans the years 1984 – 2003 . As in Pisano ( 1997 ) , in the cases where the same molecule is being developed for multiple therapeutic applications ( e . g . cancer , infectious diseases , cardiovascular diseases , etc . ) , each application is treated as a separate project . Let us emphasize that we use the data not for exact empirical estimations , but , rather , to show that our model addresses realistic issues and gives consistent insights into alliance decisions . Our results on the terms of the contracts are expressed as a function of the bargaining power of the ﬁrm S ( the biotech ﬁrm ) . To operationalize this concept , we use a proxy variable which we deﬁne as the number of prior alliances . The rationale behind this is that the more experienced the biotech ﬁrm is , the better it is able to negotiate and has a higher bargaining power . On the other hand for the inexperienced ﬁrms ( such as the new entrants ) we would expect that their negotiation leverage is lower , that they have a lower bargaining power . As the average number of alliances in our sample is 20 . 7 ( with standard deviation of 23 ) , we deﬁne the ﬁrms with less then 5 alliances as inexperienced ( therefore having low bargaining power ) , and we deﬁne those with more that 35 alliances as experienced ( thus having high bargaining power ) . There are 60 ﬁrms in the ﬁrst group and 52 ﬁrms in the second group . When we exclude the cases in which both the royalty and the equity are unreported , we are left with 53 ﬁrms in the ﬁrst group and 39 in the second group . We ﬁnd that the inexperienced ﬁrms have larger percentage of alliances signed in the preclinical phase ( 68 . 1 % vs . 56 % for experienced ﬁrms ) , which is consistent with the ar - gument that their utility of entering the alliances early is larger than for other ﬁrms , as postulated in Nicholson et al ( 2003 ) . Regarding the royalty and equity arrangements , we ﬁnd that the inexperienced ﬁrms are more likely to contract on royalty only ( Table 1 ) . This supports our ﬁndings expressed in Figures 2 , 5 , 6 and 8 , that for the low bargaining 27 power royalty is the prevailing instrument ( in fact , in the low range , equity is mostly zero in Figures 6 and 8 ) . For the experienced ﬁrms the data shows that equity is the more important instrument , which supports our ﬁndings that the higher bargaining power goes together with larger equity ( Figures 2 , 5 , 6 and 8 again ) . Table 1 Contract terms depending on ﬁrm experience Royalty only Equity only Both royalty and equity Inexperienced ﬁrms 50 . 9 % 28 . 3 % 20 . 7 % Experienced ﬁrms 33 . 3 % 41 . 0 % 25 . 6 % Similarly , in Table 2 we see that the experienced ﬁrms receive larger equity than those with less experience , which is again consistent with our predictions . ( However , without the outliers , consisting of seven applications of the same molecule , the diﬀerence , while there , is not statistically signiﬁcant . ) Table 2 Average equity Average equity Inexperienced ﬁrms 12 . 65 Experienced ﬁrms 292 . 7 ( 29 . 2 without outliers ) A further validation of the model is that we ﬁnd evidence of ”sticky” royalties , conﬁrm - ing the predictions from our theoretical models . Examining our database shows that among all the co - development alliances between a biotech company in the role of a R & D originator and a partnering pharma company , the royalties that range between 40 % and 60 % appear in 51 . 5 % of the contracts . In particular , the royalties of exactly 50 % appear in 42 . 3 % of the contracts . Our models explain the “stickiness” of royalties either as a consequence of asym - metric information and the extra beneﬁt of entering early ( Figure 6 ) , or as a consequence 28 of using all the contracting instruments – royalties , equity , initial cash payments and future cash payments ( Figures 7 and 8 ) . When the contracts do not involve any kind of cash payments , we would expect the royalties not to go below 50 % regardless of how small the bargaining power is ( Figure 6 ) . However , since in reality most contracts between pharma and biotech companies involve cash payments ( in fact , they can be especially crucial for inexperienced companies which might lack resources for development ) , the cases described by Figures 7 and 8 may be more relevant . In addition to sticky royalties , it is evident from Figure 8 ( asymmetric information ) that the prediction is that the royalties rise somewhat with the bargaining power . We ﬁnd conﬁrmation in the data that the inexperienced ﬁrms are , indeed , paid smaller royalties : 34 . 2 % of the inexperienced ﬁrms receive royalties of less than 20 % , while that is true for only 17 . 4 % of the experienced ﬁrms . That is , larger bar - gaining power implies larger royalties , consistent with the theoretical implications shown in Figure 8 . ( However , again , the diﬀerence is not statistically signiﬁcant if we take out the outliers . ) 6 Conclusions In this paper we use real options theory to model the decision of two ( potentially risk averse ) ﬁrms to enter a co - development alliance , where one ﬁrm is the project originator . Methodologically , we use the theory of the optimal stopping of diﬀusion processes . We consider both the case of symmetric information between the two ﬁrms , and the asymmetric information case in which one ﬁrm , called S , has complete knowledge about the project , but the other ﬁrm , called L , does not . In the latter case we assume that ﬁrm S decides on the initiation time , while ﬁrm L decides on how to share the proﬁts . We determine the optimal entry times in both the symmetric and the asymmetric case . When the contract does not include ﬁxed cash payments , we ﬁnd that in both cases the royalties and the up - front , equity payments increase with ﬁrm S ’s bargaining power . When this power is smaller than ﬁrm L ’s power ( as is often the case ) , ﬁrm L oﬀers royalties that are larger than the equity payments . In case when ﬁrm S has larger bargaining power than ﬁrm L , the equity payments become higher than royalties . However , if we assume 29 that ﬁrm S enjoys extra utility from alliance ( as in the cases when the alliance with ﬁrm L sends a positive signal about ﬁrm S ’s quality to future partners / investors ) , the situation changes signiﬁcantly and we observe that the royalties become ”sticky” , i . e . ﬁrm L oﬀers the same proﬁt percentage to ﬁrms of various bargaining power , as long as the latter is low . The ( approximate ) optimality of 50 % royalties also occurs in the case of symmetric information and ﬁxed cash payments allowed in the contract , as well as in the case of asymmetric information , ﬁxed cash payments allowed , and comparable bargaining power of the two ﬁrms . Thus , our model oﬀers explanations for a real world phenomenon seen in the biotechnology / pharmaceutical co - development contracts where royalties of around 50 % are very common . Another empirical fact also present in our theoretical models is that the ﬁrms with lower bargaining power ( less experience ) are paid more by royalties than by equity . We also examine the sensitivity to project quality and ﬁnd that in many cases the pa - rameters of the optimal contract do not change much when project quality changes , which indicates that the contract oﬀered is quite robust . This is in line with the prevalence of the same type of contracts in biotechnology / pharmaceutical co - developments . With higher project quality ﬁrm S waits longer , in order to achieve higher level of initial proﬁts . How - ever , the relative ratio of initial entry levels between symmetric and asymmetric information does not change much . As could be expected , project uncertainty and risk aversion both cause delays in entering co - developments . It would be of signiﬁcant interest to extend our analysis to the following cases : - Moral hazard risk coming from uncertainty about ﬁrm L ’s commitment to the project . One way to model this is to replace the project quality parameter b with b + e , where eﬀort e is controlled by ﬁrm L , but unobserved by ﬁrm S . This would mean solving a problem of optimal contracting with moral hazard and optional entry time , something which has not been done in general . 3 Similarly , we could assume that ﬁrm S controls b . - Modeling optimal time of exit . This would then encompass the excellent idea of Savva and Scholtes ( 2007 ) to include opt - out options in order to increase the eﬃciency of contracts . 3 However , see Cvitani´c , Wan and Zhang ( 2008 ) for moral hazard problems with optional exit time . 30 We leave the analysis of these ambitious modeling frameworks for future research . 7 Appendix Lemma 7 . 1 We have E x (cid:183)(cid:90) τ + T τ e − rs h ( X s ) ds (cid:184) = E x (cid:183) e − rτ E X τ (cid:90) T 0 e − ru h ( X u ) du (cid:184) Proof : Directly from E x (cid:183)(cid:90) τ + T τ e − rs h ( X s ) ds (cid:184) = E x (cid:183) e − rτ E F τ (cid:90) T 0 e − ru h ( X τ + u ) du (cid:184) = E x (cid:183) e − rτ E X τ (cid:90) T 0 e − ru h ( X u ) du (cid:184) Consider the problem V ( x ) = sup τ E x [ 1 { τ < ∞ } e − rτ g ( X τ ) ] ( 7 . 16 ) where dX t = X t [ bdt + σdW t ] and we have r > 0 , r > b .

Theorem 7 . 1 Under Assumption ( 7 . 1 ) , we have w ( x ) = V ( x ) and the optimal stopping time is ˆ τ = inf { t ≥ 0 | X t ≥ x ∗ } Proof : Note that L w ( x ) ≤ 0 , x > 0 We also want to show that w ( x ) ≥ g ( x ) , x < x ∗ By deﬁnition of w and A this is equivalent to g ( x ∗ ) ( x ∗ ) n ≥ g ( x ) ( x ) n , x ≤ x ∗ ( 7 . 17 ) 32 We have d dx (cid:181) g ( x ) ( x ) n (cid:182) = − q ( x ) ( x ) 2 n However , since x ∗ is the unique solution of q ( x ) = 0 and q ( 0 ) < 0 , we see that the above derivative is positive for x < x ∗ , which proves ( 7 . 17 ) . Next , deﬁne τ k = inf { t ≥ 0 | X t ≤ 1 / k } Fix T > 0 . By Ito’s rule , e − r ( τ ∧ τ k ∧ T ) w ( X τ ∧ τ k ∧ T ) = w ( x ) + (cid:90) τ ∧ τ k ∧ T 0 e − rs L w ( X s ) ds + M k , T τ ( 7 . 18 ) where M k , T t = (cid:90) t ∧ τ k ∧ T 0 e − rs σX s w (cid:48) ( X s ) dW s We have E (cid:183)(cid:90) T 0 [ e − rs σX s w (cid:48) ( X s ) ] 2 1 { s ≤ τ k } ds (cid:184) ≤ sup x ∈ [ 1 / k , x ∗ ] [ σxw (cid:48) ( x ) ] 2 T + E (cid:183)(cid:90) T 0 [ σX s w (cid:48) ( X s ) ] 2 1 { X s > x ∗ } ds (cid:184) ≤ sup x ∈ [ 1 / k , x ∗ ] [ σxw (cid:48) ( x ) ] 2 T + C (cid:181) T + (cid:90) T 0 E [ X jt ] dt (cid:182) < ∞ This means that M k , T is a martingale , and that E [ M k , T τ ] = 0 . This implies , taking expec - tations in ( 7 . 18 ) , using L w ≤ 0 , w ≥ g , that E (cid:163) e − rτ g ( X τ ) 1 { τ ≤ τ k ∧ T } (cid:164) ≤ w ( x ) − w ( 1 / k ) E (cid:163) e − rτ k 1 { τ k ≤ T ≤ τ } (cid:164) − E (cid:163) e − rT w ( X T ) 1 { T < τ k < τ } (cid:164) ( 7 . 19 ) Since w ( 0 ) = 0 , the middle term on the right - hand side converges to zero as k → ∞ . Moreover , since 0 ≤ w ( x ) ≤ C ( 1 + | g ( x ) | ) , and because of Assumption 7 . 1 ( vi ) , the last term converges to zero when T → ∞ . Finally , by Assumption 7 . 1 ( v ) , we can use the dominated convergence theorem to conclude that the term on the left - hand side converges to E (cid:163) e − rτ g ( X τ ) 1 { τ < ∞ } (cid:164) . After taking expected value and the limits , we get V ( x ) ≤ w ( x ) . 33 If we now repeat the above argument with τ = ˆ τ , we will see that everything holds as equality , hence V ( x ) = w ( x ) and ˆ τ is optimal . 7 . 1 Verifying Assumption 7 . 1 We consider the function g ( x ) = c 0 + I (cid:88) i = 1 c i x γ i / γ i for x > 0 , with c i ≥ 0 and at least one c i > 0 for i ≥ 1 . For those i ≥ 1 with c i > 0 we also assume that all γ i are of the same sign , that we have γ i c 0 < 0 , and that θ i > 0 . Obviously , g (cid:48) > 0 , g (cid:48)(cid:48) < 0 . We can compute q (cid:48) = ( ng − xg (cid:48) ) (cid:48) = ( n − 1 ) g (cid:48) − xg (cid:48)(cid:48) > 0 Also , we have q ( 0 ) < 0 , q ( ∞ ) > 0 . Thus , there exists a unique x ∗ such that q ( x ∗ ) = 0 . From this , and from q ( x ) = nc 0 + (cid:88) i c i x γ i ( n / γ i − 1 ) we can compute nc 0 = − (cid:88) i c i ( x ∗ ) γ i ( n / γ i − 1 ) We also have L ( x ) : = L g ( x ) = − (cid:88) i c i x γ i θ i / γ i − rc 0 Note that L (cid:48) ( x ) = − (cid:88) i c i x γ i − 1 θ i < 0 So , in order to prove L ( x ) ≤ 0 for x ≥ x ∗ , it is suﬃcient to show L ( x ∗ ) ≤ 0 . From the above expressions for c 0 and L ( x ) we get L ( x ∗ ) = (cid:88) i c i ( x ∗ ) γ i [ r ( 1 γ i − 1 n ) − θ i / γ i ] = (cid:88) i c i ( x ∗ ) γ i [ − r n + 1 2 ( γ i − 1 ) σ 2 + b ] 34 Recalling the notation β = 2 b / σ 2 and that γ i < 1 , it is then suﬃcient to show nβ − 2 r / σ 2 ≤ 0 Denote β r = 2 r / σ 2 . Then the above is equivalent to β (cid:112) ( β / 2 − 1 / 2 ) 2 + β r < β r + β 2 / 2 − β / 2 or , after squaring β 2 ( β 2 / 4 − β / 2 + 1 / 4 + β r ) < β 2 r + β 4 / 4 + β 2 / 4 + β 2 β r − ββ r − β 3 / 2 After cancelations , this boils down to 0 < β 2 r − β r β = β r ( β r − β ) which is true , and we are done with proving ( iii ) . Assumption ( iv ) is straightforward . Next , we can easily see that e − rt X γt / γ = Ce − θt M t where M t = exp { σ 2 t / 2 + σW t } is a positive martingale with expectation equal to one . Then , ( vi ) follows immediately since θ > 0 . Similarly , using Fatou’s lemma and looking at a sequence τ ∧ N and letting N → ∞ , we also get ( v ) . 7 . 2 Exit and mixed entry / exit problem Following Johnson and Zervos ( 2008 ) , we illustrate in this section how it is possible to transform exit problem and mixed entry / exit problem into a standard optimal stopping problem . The general entry / exit problem is to maximize over the entry time τ 0 and exit time τ 1 35 the quantity E x (cid:183) 1 { τ 0 < ∞ } (cid:181)(cid:90) τ 1 τ 0 e − rt h ( X t ) dt + e − rτ 0 h 0 ( X τ 0 ) (cid:182) + e − rτ 1 h 1 ( X τ 1 ) 1 { τ 1 < ∞ } (cid:184) Denote R h ( x ) = E x (cid:90) ∞ 0 e − rs h ( X s ) ds Then , as in Lemma ( 7 . 1 ) , the above is equivalent to the maximization problem w ( x ) = sup τ 0 E x (cid:163) 1 { τ 0 < ∞ } (cid:169) e − rτ 0 (cid:161) [ R h + h 0 ] ( X τ 0 ) − E X τ 0 (cid:163)(cid:161) e − rτ 1 [ R h − h 1 ] ( X τ 1 ) (cid:162) 1 { τ 1 < ∞ } (cid:164)(cid:162)(cid:170)(cid:164) In the pure exit problem we have τ 0 = 0 . In this case the optimal τ 1 is the ﬁrst time X goes below a level X 0 . The value function can be written as v A ( x ) = R h ( x ) + sup τ 1 E x [ − e − rτ 1 ( R h + h 1 ) ( X τ 1 ) 1 { τ 1 < ∞ } ] The mixed entry / exit problem can then be written as sup τ 0 E x (cid:163)(cid:161) e − rτ 0 ( (cid:163) v A − h 0 (cid:164) ( X τ 0 ) (cid:162) 1 { τ 0 < ∞ } (cid:164) and is thus reduced to another classical optimal stopping problem .
