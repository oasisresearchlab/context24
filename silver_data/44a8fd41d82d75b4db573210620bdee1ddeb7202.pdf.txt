Triangular Springs for Modeling Nonlinear Membranes Herve´ Delingette Abstract —This paper provides a formal connection between springs and continuum mechanics in the context of one - dimensional and two - dimensional elasticity . In the first stage , the equivalence between tensile springs and the finite element discretization of stretching energy of planar curves is established . Furthermore , when the strain is a quadratic function of stretch , this energy can be described with a new type of springs called tensile biquadratic springs . In the second stage , we extend this equivalence to nonlinear membranes ( St Venant - Kirchhoff materials ) on triangular meshes leading to triangular biquadratic and quadratic springs . Those tensile and angular springs produce isotropic deformations parameterized by Young modulus and Poisson ratios on unstructured meshes in an efficient and simple way . For a specific choice of the Poisson ratio , 1 / 3 , we show that regular spring - mass models may be used realistically to simulate a membrane behavior . Finally , the different spring formulations are tested in pure traction and cloth simulation experiments .

Ç 1 I NTRODUCTION I N recent years , computer graphics has tackled the tough challenge of simulating the deformation of flexible objects , sometimes in real - time , by developing a wide variety of physically based models [ 1 ] . Although some of those models are not strictly based on the law of physics , a growing number are borrowed or inspired from mechanical engineering and especially from continuum mechanics . If we only focus on simulating the deformation of surface objects , the mechanical theory of interest is the theory of plates and shells [ 2 ] . Plates and shells are volumetric bodies whose thickness is small compared to their extent , plates being flat surfaces that can bend or twist and shells being curved smooth surfaces . Because the computer graphics community is mainly interested in simulating the deforma - tion of clothes or anatomical membranes , the focus has mainly been on the shell theory . In this framework , the energy necessary to deform a shell can be decomposed into the sum of a membrane energy and a bending energy . The membrane term corresponds to the in - plane stretching energy and requires only first - order derivatives of the displacement . On the other hand , the bending energy is related with the variation of surface curvature and involves second - order derivatives . There exists several thin shell models associated with different kinematic hypothesis . One common choice is the Kirchhoff - Love thin shell theory [ 3 ] , where lines initially normal to the middle surface are assumed to remain straight after deformation to keep their initial length and to remain normal to the middle surface . For instance , Eischen et al . [ 4 ] has modeled cloth deforma - tion based on the Kirchhoff - Love thin shell theory . Cirak et al . [ 5 ] have used subdivision surfaces to discretize the developed Kirchhoff - Love energy without including any nodal rotations . This work was extended by Green [ 3 ] to include quadrilateral elements and better enforcements of boundary conditions . Despite the development of those rather complex “physi - cally - based” models , a large number of animation systems are still largely based on the mass springs , because they are supposedly both simple to understand and to implement . Mass - springs models are essentially discrete models that define elastic forces between two vertices based on the variation of the edge length . Although spring forces are related to the theory of one - dimensional ( 1D ) elasticity ( see Section 2 ) , they cannot be used to discretize two or three - dimensional ( 3D ) elastic materials based on continuum mechanics . Van Gelder [ 6 ] showed , for instance , that spring - mass models cannot represent linear elastic mem - branes but proposed a spring stiffness formulation that approximate the membrane behavior ( see Section 4 . 2 ) . The discrete nature of spring - mass systems is particularly problematic when handling unstructured triangular or tetrahedral meshes . To cope with this limitation , a number of researchers [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] have proposed computational methods to estimate the topologies and the stiffness of springs . However , a more common alternative is to define springs on a rectangular [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] or hexahedral lattice [ 11 ] in order to improve the isotropy and homogeneity of the deformation . Knowing the limitations of mass - springs models , several authorshavedeveloped“particlesystems” [ 1 ] , closelyrelated to the intuitive notion of springs but that are more physically plausiblewithoutresortingtothecomplexityoftheKirchhoff - Love models . Terzopoulos et al . [ 9 ] in 1988 , for instance , proposed a membrane ( respectively , bending ) energy that corresponds to the weighted norm of the difference between the first ( respectively , second ) fundamental form of the deformed configuration and that of the rest configuration . Those deformation energies were discretized and approxi - matedwithfinitedifferencesonaregulargrid . Provot [ 12 ] and Breen et al . [ 13 ] proposed to include some nonlinear effects in the stiffness of mass - springs models in order to better simulate cloth deformation . Baraff and Witkin [ 14 ] replaced the membrane energy introduced in [ 9 ] , which is a quartic function of position with a quadratic function , but which is IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS , VOL . 14 , NO . 2 , MARCH / APRIL 2008 329 .

Eischen and Bigliani [ 15 ] compared finite elements and modified mass - spring models on a regular lattice and showed similar behavior . Bour - guignon and Cani [ 16 ] have proposed to include anisotropic behavior in mass - springs models by adding angular springs . Volino et al . [ 17 ] used a linear strain - stress relationship to modelclothdeformationandlater [ 18 ] proposedamembrane energy on nonregular triangular meshes that couples the elongation of all triangle edges . Etzmuss et al . [ 19 ] have carefully derived a particle system from the equations of continuum mechanics on a regular surface grid . They approximate the strain tensor by defining a sheared rest frame and derive a formulation where tension and shearing forces are computed from the dot product of edge vectors . Grinspun et al . [ 20 ] have defined a membrane energy that penalizes the change of edge elongation and triangle area , similarlytotheapproachproposedbyTeschneretal . [ 21 ] , and a bending energy related with the change of dihedral angle of each triangle edge . Etzmuss et al . [ 22 ] use a corotational approach to apply the linear elastic membrane formulation even in case of large rotation of triangles . Thomaszewski et al . [ 23 ] extended the corotational principle to the linearized Kirchhoff - Love model discretized with subdivision surfaces . Bridson et al . [ 24 ] have introduced bending forces that minimize the variation of the dihedral angle around each edge , whereas Choi and Ko [ 25 ] use nonlinear springs for the membrane and bending energies on a regular lattice to cope with the postbuckling instabilities of fabrics . Volino and Magnenat - Thalmann [ 26 ] proposedlinearizedbendingforces that are suited for implicit time integration . Themodelsmentionedaboveareinspiredfromcontinuum mechanics and have some nice properties in the context of Computer Graphics : They are usually invariant with respect to rigid transformations , and they are often simple to implement , relatively efficient to compute and lead to plausibledeformations . However , thosemodelsdonotfollow the laws of continuum mechanics or only on restricted cases ( small displacements , . . . ) . As such , they lack one essential property : The deformation of a model based on continuum mechanics only depends on its number of degrees of freedom but not on the discretization method . This is a very important property since it allows to build efficient algorithms based on multigridapproaches [ 27 ] , adaptiverefinementmethods [ 28 ] , or to combine two different discretization methods in the same object ( for example , hybrid models in [ 29 ] ) . Further - more , continuum models guarantee the true isotropy or anisotropyofthematerialthatisoftendifficulttoenforcewithdiscretemodels . Dealing with continuum models instead of discrete ones has been reported in many computer graphics papers as being far more complex and as leading to greater computa - tion times . Although this is true in general , for specific choices of the discretization method ( constant strain finite element method ) , continuum models may actually be as simple and even more efficient [ 29 ] than mass - spring models ( see Section 5 . 1 ) . In this paper , we show the total equivalence between a continuum formulation of the membrane energy and the energy of a set of triangular biquadratic springs ( TRBS ) . Those springs do not correspond exactly to the regular springs that are commonly encountered in computer graphics . However , we show that for small deformations , they are equivalent to regular ( quadratic ) tensile and angular springs . Furthermore , TRBS are simple to implement and efficient to compute , and they have a similar complexity than mass - spring models , even if they are continuum models based on nonlinear finite strain mechanics . To derive these new spring models , we first look at the theory of 1D elasticity and show how it is closely related to the concept of springs . In Section 3 , a nonlinear membrane energy on two - dimensional ( 2D ) manifolds is described , and a formal equivalence of that strain energy and biquadratic springs is established when discretized with the finite element method on linear triangles . In Section 4 , two limit cases of that strain energy are studied : small displacements and small deformations . In the latter case , equivalence with regular tensile and angular springs is established . Finally , in Section 5 , we benchmark the different membrane formulation in test cases but also in the context of cloth simulation . 2 S PRINGS AND O NE - D IMENSIONAL E LASTICITY 2 . 1 Linear Elastic Axially Loaded Bar In this section , we detail how a linear elastic material under large displacements is formulated for an axially loaded bar that is clamped on one side . The bar is assumed to have a constant cross - sectional area A , the center of each cross - sectionsbeingonastraightline ( seeFig . 1 ) oflength L . Therest configuration of the bar is (cid:2) (cid:2) IR 3 and after applying an axial load , each center of cross - sections X 2 ½ 0 ; L (cid:3) is moved into a new position (cid:2) ð X Þ 2 ½ 0 ; (cid:2) ð L Þ(cid:3) . An infinitesimal material segment of length dx and located around center point X is deformedintoasegmentoflength d (cid:2) dx ð X Þ dx . Thestretchratio s is thus s ¼ d (cid:2) dx . When this stretch ratio is exactly one , then the deformation does not entail any local stretching effect around point X . The strain (cid:2) at this point is a quantity that measures how different is this stretch ratio from the value one , positive strain implying extension of the material and negative strain contraction . There exists a family of possible strain functions : (cid:2) ð C Þ ¼ 1 (cid:3) s (cid:3) (cid:4) 1 ð Þ if (cid:3) 6¼ 0 log ð s Þ if (cid:3) ¼ 0 (cid:2) (cid:3) : When (cid:3) ¼ 1 , (cid:2) ¼ s (cid:4) 1 , it is called the engineering strain . For (cid:3) ¼ 2 (cid:2) ¼ 1 = 2 ð s 2 (cid:4) 1 Þ , it corresponds to the Green - Lagrange strain , whereas (cid:3) ¼ 0 corresponds to the Henky or natural strain . The engineering strain is maybe the most intuitive strain measure since it corresponds to a relatively length variation ; however , it does not generalize easily to 2D or 3D elastic materials . The Green - Lagrange strain on the other hand is most widely used because it is analytically tractable , 330 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS , VOL . 14 , NO . 2 , MARCH / APRIL 2008 Fig . 1 . Axially loaded bar in rest ( top ) and deformed ( bottom ) configurations . All cross sections are identical and of area A . The center line is a segment of rest length L and is parameterized with function P ð (cid:4) Þ ( respectively , Q ð (cid:4) Þ ) , (cid:4) 2 ½ a ; b (cid:3) in its rest ( respectively , deformed ) position . but it leads to nonintuitive behavior for strong compression [ 30 ] . Henky strain leads to more complex computations but possesses many remarkable properties [ 31 ] . Making the hypothesis of a linear elastic material , the ( nominal ) stress S ð X Þ ( energy conjugate of strain ) at each point is proportional to the strain at that point : S ¼ (cid:5)(cid:2) , where (cid:5) is a stiffness parameter ( in Nm (cid:4) 2 ) . The work W necessary to bringthematerialcrosssectionfromcenterpoint X to (cid:2) ð X Þ is therefore W ¼ 12 S(cid:2) and the total energy W (cid:2) required to deform the bar (cid:2) , assumed to be homogeneous , is : W (cid:2) ¼ Z (cid:2) 1 2 S(cid:2) dV ¼ (cid:5)A 2 (cid:3) 2 Z L 0 d (cid:2) dx (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:4) 1 (cid:4) (cid:5) 2 d X : If the segment ½ 0 ; L (cid:3) is parameterized by a function X ¼ P ð (cid:4) Þ , (cid:4) 2 ½ a ; b (cid:3) (cid:2) IR , and its deformation by a function (cid:2) ð X Þ ¼ Q ð (cid:4) Þ , (cid:4) 2 ½ a ; b (cid:3) (cid:2) IR , then the deformation function can be written as : (cid:2) ð X Þ ¼ Q ð P (cid:4) 1 ð X ÞÞ . In this case , the total energy W (cid:2) can be expressed as : W (cid:2) ¼ (cid:5)A 2 (cid:3) 2 Z b a dQ d(cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:4) dP d(cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) 2 dP d(cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:5) ð 1 (cid:4) 2 (cid:3) Þ d(cid:4) : ð 1 Þ 2 . 2 Stretching Energy of Deformable Curves Instead of studying the deformation of a straight bar , we consider a curved bar (cid:2) of cross - section A embedded in a euclidean space IR d , d > 1 . The center line curve parameter - ized as P ð (cid:4) Þ is deformed into another curve (cid:2) ð (cid:2) Þ , parameterized with Q ð (cid:4) Þ , (cid:4) 2 ½ a ; b (cid:3) ( Fig . 2 ) . To obtain the stretching energy necessary to deform (cid:2) into (cid:2) ð (cid:2) Þ , it suffices to replace in ( 1 ) the first derivative dPd(cid:4) with the norm of the first derivative k d P d(cid:4) k : W (cid:2) ¼ (cid:5)A 2 (cid:3) 2 Z b a d Q d(cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:3) (cid:4) d P d(cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:5) 2 d P d(cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:6)(cid:6) ð 1 (cid:4) 2 (cid:3) Þ d(cid:4) : ð 2 Þ If the parameter (cid:4) is the arc length of the reference curve P ð (cid:4) Þ , then the stretching energy simplifies as : W (cid:2) ¼ (cid:5)A 2 (cid:3) 2 Z (cid:2) d Q d(cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:6)(cid:6) (cid:3) (cid:4) 1 (cid:4) (cid:5) 2 d(cid:4) : ð 3 Þ Clearly , this functional is zero if the arc length of P ð (cid:4) Þ is also the arc length of deformed curve Q ð (cid:4) Þ . 2 . 3 Finite Element Discretization We use in the remainder the Rayleigh - Ritz approach [ 32 , p . 60 ] of the finite element method . This approach is equivalent in this case to the Galerkin weighted residual method and relies on the variational form ( strain energy ) rather than the weak form ( principle of virtual work ) of the same elasticity problem . Dealing with the variational form is more convenient to derive symmetric analytical expres - sions and is widely used in computer graphics . Equations are derived by first discretizing the stretching energy and then applying the principle of minimum potential energy . In ( 2 ) , the coordinate functions P ð (cid:4) Þ and Q ð (cid:4) Þ only need to have their first derivative square integrable . Therefore , the reference curve (cid:2) can be approximated with a set (cid:2) h of line segments S i : (cid:2) h ¼ S i ¼ 1 ; . . . ; N S i ¼ ½ P i ; P i þ 1 (cid:3) . Each reference segment ½ P i ; P i þ 1 (cid:3) isdeformedintosegment ½ Q i ; Q i þ 1 (cid:3) , theset of points f Q i g , i ¼ 1 ; . . . ; N , being the nodes of the finite element model . Each segment in the reference or deformed configuration can be parameterized as a linear interpolation : P ð (cid:4) Þ ¼ ð 1 (cid:4) (cid:4) Þ P i þ (cid:4) P i þ 1 ; Q ð (cid:4) Þ ¼ ð 1 (cid:4) (cid:4) Þ Q i þ (cid:4) Q i þ 1 : To simplify notations , we write L i ¼ k P i P i þ 1 k , the length of the rest segment , and l i ¼ k Q i Q i þ 1 k , the length of the deformed segment . The stretching energy W (cid:2) h of the discretized domain (cid:2) h is the sum of the stretching energy of each line segment W (cid:2) h ð S i Þ . Because the first derivative is constant on each element , the stretch ratio of segment S i is simply l i = L i , and therefore , the stretching energy W (cid:2) h ð S i Þ is : W (cid:2) h ð S i Þ ¼ (cid:5)AL ð 1 (cid:4) 2 (cid:3) Þ i 2 (cid:3) 2 l (cid:3)i (cid:4) L (cid:3)i (cid:7) (cid:8) 2 : ð 4 Þ For engineering strain ð (cid:3) ¼ 1 Þ , the stretching energy therefore corresponds to the energy of a spring of stiffness (cid:5)A = L i . Thus , a set of masses along a curve that are connected with springs corresponds to the discretization of the stretching energy of that curve for engineering strain . When the first variation of the energy given in ( 3 ) is considered , we find the same expression as the 1D wave equation found by Etzmuss et al . [ 19 ] : (cid:6)W (cid:2) h ð S i Þ ¼ (cid:5)A d 2 Q d(cid:4) 2 (cid:4) d t Q d(cid:4) (cid:4) (cid:5) ; where t Q is the tangent vector at point Q ð (cid:4) Þ . For Green - Lagrange strain ð (cid:3) ¼ 2 Þ , the stretching energy is a biquadratic function of the deformed segment length l i and of the deformed position Q i : W (cid:2) h ð S i Þ ¼ (cid:5)A 8 L 3 i l 2 i (cid:4) L 2 i (cid:7) (cid:8) 2 : ð 5 Þ Because this expression resembles a ( quadratic ) spring energy but with squared lengths , it is coined as a tensile biquadratic spring . To study the difference between regular ( or quadratic ) and biquadratic springs , it is convenient to write each stretching energy as a function of the stretch ratio s . In both cases , the stretching energy can be written as W (cid:2) h ð S i Þ ¼ (cid:5)AL i w ð s Þ ; where w ð s Þ ¼ w Q ð s Þ ¼ 1 = 2 ð 1 (cid:4) s Þ 2 for quadratic springs and w ð s Þ ¼ w B ð s Þ ¼ 1 = 8 ð 1 (cid:4) s 2 Þ 2 for biquadratic springs .

The deformed positions f Q i g are the nodes ( unknown variables ) of the finite element model . the graphs in Fig . 3 , one can see that for a large extension of those springs , s > 1 : 2 , both energies increase sharply , biquadratic springs being far more stiffer than quadratic springs . For large compression , where the stretch ratio is below 0 . 8 , they behave quite differently : The quadratic springs lead to a force proportional to the stretch ratio , whereas for the biquadratic springs , the compression force reaches a maximum for s ¼ ﬃﬃﬃ 2 p = 2 and then decreases toward zero as the stretch ratio decreases toward zero ( see Fig . 3a ) . Therefore , biquadratic springs have a rather unphysical behavior when compressed since an increase of compression creates a decrease of the elastic force when s < ﬃﬃﬃ 2 p = 2 ( see [ 30 ] for similar comments ) . Quadratic springs can also be qualified as unphysical since a finite amount of energy is sufficient to produce a full compression of the material , that is , s ¼ 0 . Only the logarithm strain function leads to a plausible elastic energy : This is why it has been qualified as natural strain . If we make the hypothesis that each segment under - goes small deformations but possibly large displacements , s (cid:5) 1 , then we can make the following approximation : l 2 i (cid:4) L 2 i (cid:5) 2 L i l i (cid:4) L i ð Þ . In this case , the energies of the quadratic and biquadratic springs are becoming equiva - lent . In fact , given that all strain functions have the same first and second derivatives around s ¼ 1 , the stretching energy for small deformations is independent on the choice of the strain function . 2 . 4 Linear Elasticity : Small Displacements Hypothesis We now make an even more restrictive hypothesis regard - ing the deformation of the curve : We assume that all vertex displacement U i ¼ Q i (cid:4) P i is small compared to the edge length L i . Replacing each vertex position Q i by P i þ U i , we make the following approximation : l (cid:3)i (cid:5) L (cid:3)i þ (cid:3)L ð (cid:3) (cid:4) 2 Þ i ð U i þ 1 (cid:4) U i Þ (cid:6) ð P i þ 1 (cid:4) P i Þ : Therefore , for small displacements , all strain functions can be approximated as the same linear function of displacement : ð s (cid:3) (cid:4) 1 Þ = (cid:3) (cid:5) ð U i þ 1 (cid:4) U i Þ (cid:6) ð P i þ 1 (cid:4) P i Þ = L 2 i : In such case , the strain is a linear function of displacement but also of stress : This is why such model is called a linear elastic model . Its stretching energy is a quadratic function of displacements : W Linear(cid:2) h ð S i Þ ¼ (cid:5)A L 3 i ð U i þ 1 (cid:4) U i Þ (cid:6) ð P i þ 1 (cid:4) P i Þ ð Þ 2 : To summarize , 1D elasticity on curves ( stretching term ) can be discretized with springs given the following choices : . linear relation between strain and stress , . linear element for the finite element discretization , and . large displacement hypothesis ( finite strain ) . For Green - Lagrange strain , the finite - element method leads to the biquadratic springs , whereas for engineering strain , it leads to regular ( or quadratic ) springs . Finally , there exists two limit cases that are independent on the choice of the strain function : The hypothesis of small deformations and small displacements . 3 M EMBRANE E NERGY ON T RIANGULAR M ESHES 3 . 1 Membrane Energy The energy necessary to deform a piece of cloth or paper can be decomposed into different components : A mem - brane energy that characterizes the resistance to in - plane stretching and a bending energy that measures the resistance to change in the surface normal orientation . The membrane energy generalizes the stretching energy for curves and under the plane stress hypothesis [ 32 , p . 87 ] , this energy only depends on the change in local metrics of the surface ( its first fundamental form ) . We consider a 2D compact domain (cid:2) (cid:2) IR 2 being deformed into another domain (cid:2) ð (cid:2) Þ . A material point X 2 (cid:2) is moved to a new position (cid:2) ð X Þ 2 (cid:2) ð (cid:2) Þ , the function (cid:2) ð X Þ being the deformation function ( Fig . 4 ) . Similar to the stretch ratio s for the 1D case , the relative change of length around point X is captured by the spatial derivative of the deformation function . However , because the domain (cid:2) is 2D , this quantity is now a 2D tensor , the right Cauchy - Green deformation tensor C , defined as C ¼ r (cid:2) T r (cid:2) . This tensor is equivalent to the square stretch ratio s 2 for 1D elasticity , and it naturally leads to the Green - Lagrange 332 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS , VOL . 14 , NO . 2 , MARCH / APRIL 2008 Fig . 3 .

( b ) Same definition after discretizing the domain (cid:2) into a conformal triangulation (cid:2) h . strain tensor : E ¼ 1 = 2 ð C (cid:4) I Þ . Despite the existence of other strain tensors [ 33 ] , they often do not lead to closed - form expressions . The Green - Lagrange strain tensor is invariant to the application of translations or rotations and is therefore appropriate for describing deformations under large displacements . Assuming an isotropic St Venant Kirchhoff membrane for which there is a linear relationship between the stress tensor and the Green - Lagrange strain , the density of membrane energy W ð X Þ can be written as W ð X Þ ¼ (cid:5) 2 ð t r E Þ 2 þ (cid:7) 2 t r E 2 ; ð 6 Þ where (cid:5) and (cid:7) are the Lame´ coefficients of the material . Those coefficients are simply related to the physically meaningful Young modulus E and Poisson coefficient (cid:8) defined in plane elasticity [ 34 ] : (cid:5) ¼ E(cid:8) 1 (cid:4) (cid:8) 2 and (cid:7) ¼ E ð 1 (cid:4) (cid:8) Þ 1 (cid:4) (cid:8) 2 . The Young modulus quantifies the stiffness of the material , whereas the Poisson coefficient characterizes the material compressibility ( (cid:8) ¼ 1 : 0 for a 2D incompressible material 1 ) . The total membrane energy W (cid:2) consists in summing the density of energy over the whole domain : W (cid:2) ¼ Z (cid:2) W ð X Þ d (cid:2) ¼ Z (cid:2) (cid:5) 2 ð t r E Þ 2 þ (cid:7) 2 t r E 2 (cid:4) (cid:5) d (cid:2) : 3 . 2 Deformation Function of a Linear Triangle Since the density of membrane energy involves the integration of first derivatives of the deformation function (cid:2) , the domain (cid:2) is discretized into a simplicial surface (cid:2) h consisting of a set of triangles f T i g , i ¼ f 1 ; . . . ; p g , and a set of vertices f P i g , i 2 f 1 ; . . . ; n g . We choose the linear triangle element for discretizing the surface since it is the simplest 2D continuum element and leads to closed - form stiffness matrices . Thus , a functional space S h of finite dimension is defined as a set of functions that are C 0 on (cid:2) h and that are linear of each triangle . A deformation function (cid:2) h 2 S h is uniquely determined by its nodal vector f Q i g , i 2 f 1 ; . . . ; n g such that Q i ¼ (cid:2) h ð P i Þ . To compute the total membrane energy W ð (cid:2) h Þ , we must evaluate the membrane energy necessary to deform a single triangle T P consisting of vertices f P 1 ; P 2 ; P 3 g into its deformed position T Q with vertices f Q 1 ; Q 2 ; Q 3 g ( see Fig . 5 ) . We write as A P ( respectively , A Q ) the area of the rest triangle T P ( respectively , triangle T Q ) , l i ( respectively , L i ) its edge length , and (cid:3) i ( respectively , (cid:9) i ) its three angles . Any point X ¼ ð x ; y Þ T in the rest triangle T P can be parameterized with its barycentric coordinates (cid:4) i ð X Þ such that xy 1 2 4 3 5 ¼ P 1 x P 2 x P 3 x P 1 y P 2 y P 3 y 1 1 1 2 4 3 5 (cid:4) 1 (cid:4) 2 (cid:4) 3 2 4 3 5 ¼ j P j E : ð 7 Þ The inverse relation defines the barycentric coordinates of any point X 2 T P given that the triangle is not degenerate : (cid:4) 1 (cid:4) 2 (cid:4) 3 2 4 3 5 ¼ D 1 x D 1 y (cid:4) 01 D 2 x D 2 y (cid:4) 02 D 3 x D 3 y (cid:4) 03 2 4 3 5 xy 1 2 4 3 5 ¼ j D j X ; ð 8 Þ where . D i is the ith shape vector of triangle T P , and . (cid:4) 0 i is the ith barycentric coordinate of the origin of the coordinate frame . Shape vectors D i are the gradient vectors of the barycentric coordinates (cid:4) i ( the shape functions ) , and they play a key role in the discretization of the membrane energy . Those vectors are directed along the inner normal ( independently of the triangle orientation ) and are of length 1 = h i , h i being the altitude of P i ( see Fig . 6a ) . This can be translated with the following geometric relation : D i ¼ 1 2 A P ð P i (cid:7) 1 (cid:4) P i (cid:7) 2 Þ ? ; ð 9 Þ where i (cid:7) j ¼ ðð i (cid:4) 1 þ j Þ mod 3 Þ þ 1 and X ? ¼ ð(cid:4) y ; x Þ T is the orthogonal of vector X . Another important fact is that each pair of shape vectors ð D i ; D j Þ is the covariant basis of the contravariant basis made by the two vectors ð P i (cid:7) 1 (cid:4) P i (cid:7) 2 Þ and ð P j (cid:7) 1 (cid:4) P j (cid:7) 2 Þ : 4 ðA P Þ 2 ð D i (cid:6) D j Þ ¼ ð P i (cid:7) 1 (cid:4) P i (cid:7) 2 Þ (cid:6) ð P j (cid:7) 1 (cid:4) P j (cid:7) 2 Þ (cid:7) (cid:8) (cid:4) 1 : Thus , for i 6¼ j and for all vector a 2 IR 2 , we have the following two relations : a ¼ ð a (cid:6) D i Þð P i (cid:7) 1 (cid:4) P i (cid:7) 2 Þ þ ð a (cid:6) D j Þð P j (cid:7) 1 (cid:4) P j (cid:7) 2 Þ ; a ¼ ð a (cid:6) ð P i (cid:7) 1 (cid:4) P i (cid:7) 2 ÞÞ D i þ ð a (cid:6) ð P j (cid:7) 1 (cid:4) P j (cid:7) 2 ÞÞ D j : DELINGETTE : TRIANGULAR SPRINGS FOR MODELING NONLINEAR MEMBRANES 333 1 . The relations between the Young Modulus and Poisson ratio and the Lame´ coefficients are different in plane elasticity than in tridimensional elasticity . For instance , in the former case , incompressibility corresponds to (cid:8) ¼ 1 : 0 , whereas in the latter case , it corresponds to (cid:8) ¼ 0 : 5 . Fig . 5 .

( b ) The foot J i is the barycenter of points Q j and Q k with coefficients cot (cid:9) j and cot (cid:9) k , whereas pseudofoot point J ? i has barycentric coordinates cot (cid:3) j and cot (cid:3) k . Other remarkable properties of shape vectors are detailed in Appendix B , but a fundamental result is that all shape vectors sum to zero : D 1 þ D 2 þ D 3 ¼ 0 : ð 10 Þ From ( 7 ) , we get trivially X ¼ X 3 i ¼ 1 (cid:4) i ð X Þ P i ¼ X 3 i ¼ 1 (cid:4) 0 i þ D i (cid:6) X (cid:7) (cid:8) P i : The deformation function (cid:2) ð X Þ on a linear triangle maps a point X 2 T P such that (cid:2) ð X Þ has the same barycentric coordinates in triangle T Q than X in triangle T P : (cid:2) ð X Þ ¼ X 3 i ¼ 1 (cid:4) i ð X Þ Q i ¼ X 3 i ¼ 1 (cid:4) 0 i þ D i (cid:6) X (cid:7) (cid:8) Q i : ð 11 Þ 3 . 3 Invariants of the Green - Lagrange Strain Tensor To write the total membrane energy W ð T P Þ necessary to deform triangle T P into triangle T Q , it is necessary to write the two invariants tr E and tr E 2 as a function of the two triangles shape . From ( 11 ) , it can be seen that the gradient of the deformation function is constant on the rest triangle T P , which simplifies further expressions : r (cid:2) ¼ @ (cid:2) i @ x j (cid:10) (cid:11) ¼ X 3 i ¼ 1 Q i (cid:8) D i ; C ¼ r (cid:2) T r (cid:2) ¼ X 3 i ¼ 1 X 3 j ¼ 1 ð Q i (cid:6) Q j Þð D i (cid:8) D j Þ : ð 12 Þ The trace of the Green strain tensor tr E is simply derived from the trace of the tensor C : tr E ¼ 1 = 2 ð tr C (cid:4) 2 Þ . From ( 12 ) , we easily get t r C ¼ X 3 i ¼ 1 X 3 j ¼ 1 ð Q i (cid:6) Q j Þð D i (cid:6) D j Þ : ð 13 Þ Appendix C details how this sum of dot products can be expressed as a function of edge length and angles . The resulting expressions are simply : t r C ¼ 1 2 A P l 21 cot (cid:3) 1 þ l 22 cot (cid:3) 2 þ l 23 cot (cid:3) 3 (cid:7) (cid:8) ; t r E ¼ ð l 21 (cid:4) L 21 Þ cot (cid:3) 1 þ ð l 22 (cid:4) L 22 Þ cot (cid:3) 2 þ ð l 23 (cid:4) L 23 Þ cot (cid:3) 3 2 A P : The expression of tr C is closely related to the Dirichlet energy used in discrete harmonic mapping [ 35 ] . Indeed , in this case , the deformation (cid:2) maps two planar surfaces , and the right Cauchy - Green deformation tensor is just the first fundamental form and its trace the norm of the deformation matrix : tr C ¼ kr (cid:2) k 2 . Extending the analogy with the field of surface parameterization , we can see the membrane energy as a functional that enforces isometric mappings ( instead of conformal or harmonic ones ) since it is minimal when C ¼ I . The second invariant of the strain tensor tr E 2 can be written as a function of the first invariant and the determinant of E , but also of C : t r E 2 ¼ ð t r E Þ 2 (cid:4) 2 det E ¼ 1 þ 2t r E þ 2 ð t r E Þ 2 (cid:4) det C 2 : The determinant of the deformation tensor C ¼ r (cid:2) T r (cid:2) is the square of the determinant of (cid:2) , which is the ratio of the two triangle areas : det (cid:2) ¼ A Q = A P . Putting it all together , the second invariant is also a simple function of the square edge elongation (cid:3) 2 l i ¼ ð l 2 i (cid:4) L 2 i Þ : t r E 2 ¼ P i 6¼ j 2(cid:3) 2 l i (cid:3) 2 l j (cid:4) P 3 i ¼ 1 ð (cid:3) 2 l i Þ 2 64 A 2 P : 3 . 4 Membrane Energy and Triangular Biquadratic Springs The density of elastic energy W ð X Þ is given by ( 6 ) and is constant for all points in triangle T P . Thus , from previous results , we can show that the total energy to deform triangle T P into T Q is a function of the square edge variation (cid:3) 2 l i and of angles (cid:3) i of the rest triangle : W TRBS ð T P Þ ¼ Z T P W ð X Þ d X ¼ A P W ð G Þ ; W TRBS ð T P Þ ¼ X 3 i ¼ 1 ð (cid:3) 2 l i Þ 2 ð 2 cot 2 (cid:3) i ð (cid:5) þ (cid:7) Þ þ (cid:7) Þ 64 A P þ X i 6¼ j 2(cid:3) 2 l i (cid:3) 2 l j ð 2 cot (cid:3) i cot (cid:3) j ð (cid:5) þ (cid:7) Þ (cid:4) (cid:7) Þ 64 A P : ð 14 Þ We call this formulation of the membrane energy the TRBS since the first term can be interpreted as the energy of three tensile biquadratic springs that prevent edges from stretching , whereas the second term can be seen as three angular biquadratic springs that prevent any change in vertex angles . We can thus rewrite the previous equation by enforcing the existence of those two types of biquadratic springs : W TRBS ð T P Þ ¼ X 3 i ¼ 1 k T P i 4 ð l 2 i (cid:4) L 2 i Þ 2 þ X i 6¼ j c T P k 2 ð l 2 i (cid:4) L 2 i Þð l 2 j (cid:4) L 2 j Þ ; where k T P and c T P are the tensile and angular stiffness of the biquadratic springs . Replacing the Lame´ coefficients with the Young modulus E and Poisson coefficient (cid:8) , we get k T P i ¼ 2 cot 2 (cid:3) i ð (cid:5) þ (cid:7) Þ þ (cid:7) 16 A P ¼ E ð 2 cot 2 (cid:3) i þ 1 (cid:4) (cid:8) Þ 16 ð 1 (cid:4) (cid:8) 2 ÞA P ; c T P k ¼ 2 cot (cid:3) i cot (cid:3) j ð (cid:5) þ (cid:7) Þ (cid:4) (cid:7) 16 A P ¼ E ð 2 cot (cid:3) i cot (cid:3) j þ (cid:8) (cid:4) 1 Þ 16 ð 1 (cid:4) (cid:8) 2 ÞA P : The tensile stiffness is always positive , whereas the angular stiffness may be null or even negative . In Fig . 7 , normalized values of the tensile and angular stiffness are displayed as a function of the Poisson ratio . To this end , all triangles are assumed to be regular (cid:3) i ¼ (cid:10) = 3 to have unit area A P ¼ 1 and unit Young modulus E ¼ 1 . It is remark - able to note that for (cid:8) ¼ 1 = 3 , the tensile stiffness is minimum , and the angular stiffness is zero , the angular stiffness being negative for small Poisson ratio (cid:8) < 1 = 3 . When the Poisson ratio approaches 1 , the material becomes more and more incompressible and both stiffness sharply increases toward infinity . The membrane energy to deform the whole triangulation (cid:2) h is simply the sum of the energies of each triangle T P 2 (cid:2) h . Thus , if an edge is shared by two triangles T 1 and T 2 , the total 334 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS , VOL . 14 , NO . 2 , MARCH / APRIL 2008 tensile stiffness of that edge k T will be the sum of the two stiffnesses : k T ¼ k T 1 þ k T 2 . If a triangle has p triangles and e edges , the membrane energy can be decomposed into 3 p angular biquadratic springs and e tensile biquadratic springs . 3 . 5 Force and Stiffness Computation Applying the Rayleigh - Ritz analysis , we consider that the triangular surface should evolve by minimizing its mem - brane energy , therefore along the opposite derivative of that energy with respect to the nodes of the system , that is , the deformed positions Q i : F TRBSi ð T P Þ ¼ (cid:4) @ W ð T P Þ @ Q i (cid:4) (cid:5) T ¼ X j 6¼ i k T P k (cid:3) 2 l k ð Q j (cid:4) Q i Þ þ X j 6¼ i ð c T P j (cid:3) 2 l i þ c T P i (cid:3) 2 l j Þð Q j (cid:4) Q i Þ : ð 15 Þ We can provide a geometric interpretation of that force , if we consider the two points J i and J ? i in the deformed triangle T Q . The first point J i is the foot of Q i also defined as the barycenter of points Q j and Q k with coefficients cot (cid:9) j and cot (cid:9) k . The second point J ? i is a pseudofoot point defined as the barycenter of points Q j and Q k with coefficients cot (cid:3) j and cot (cid:3) k ( see Fig . 6b ) . With those two additional points , the force can be written as F TRBSi ð T P Þ ¼ ð (cid:5) þ (cid:7) Þ l 2 i t r E 4 A P ð Q i (cid:4) J ? i Þ þ (cid:7) 8 A P l 2 i ð Q i (cid:4) J ? i Þ (cid:4) L 2 i ð Q i (cid:4) J i Þ (cid:7) (cid:8) : The force is clear zero if T Q ¼ T P since we then have tr E ¼ 0 and J ? i ¼ J i . It is also important to note that if the rest triangle T P is obtuse in (cid:3) j or (cid:3) k , then the point J ? i is not in the segment ½ Q j ; Q k (cid:3) that can be the cause of instabilities . This expression is somewhat similar to the altitude springs used by Bridson et al . [ 36 ] to prevent the collapse of tetrahedra . The tangent stiffness matrix ½ B TRBSij (cid:3) is a 3 (cid:9) 3 matrix ( with ½ B TRBS ij (cid:3) ¼ ½ B TRBS ji (cid:3) T ) that describes how the elastic force varies with respect to an adjacent node position : ½ B TRBSij (cid:3) ¼ (cid:4) @ Wp @ Q i @ Q j ¼ @ F TRBSi @ Q j : Furthermore , the translation invariance implies that the diagonal stiffness matrix ½ B TRBSii (cid:3) is the opposite of the off - diagonal stiffness matrices ½ B TRBSij (cid:3) , i 6¼ j . Expanding the stiffness coefficients , we get the following expression , for k 6¼ i , j : ½ B TRBSij (cid:3) ¼ ð (cid:11) T P k (cid:3) 2 l k þ c T P j (cid:3) 2 l i þ c T P i (cid:3) 2 l j Þ I þ 2 c T P k ð Q i (cid:4) Q k Þ (cid:8) ð Q k (cid:4) Q j Þ þ 2 c T P i ð Q i (cid:4) Q k Þ (cid:8) ð Q i (cid:4) Q j Þ þ 2 c T P j ð Q j (cid:4) Q i Þ (cid:8) ð Q j (cid:4) Q k Þ þ 2 k T P k ð Q i (cid:4) Q j Þ (cid:8) ð Q i (cid:4) Q j Þ : ð 16 Þ 3 . 6 Stress Tensors and Law of Motion In finite strain mechanics , there are different definition of stress tensors depending if it is expressed in the reference or the deformed configuration . The second Piola - Kirchhoff , for instance , is a symmetric tensor defined as the energy conjugate of the strain tensor S ¼ @ W = @ E . Because we use a linear material , this stress tensor is proportional to the strain tensor : S ¼ (cid:5) ð tr E Þ I þ (cid:7) E . The Cauchy or true stress tensor (cid:3) represents the force per unit area of the deformed solid (cid:3) ¼ ðA Q = A P Þðr (cid:2)S r (cid:2) T Þ . The first Piola - Kirchhoff or nominal stress tensor T is the energy conjugate of the deformation gradient and is simply related with the second Piola - Kirchhoff stress T ¼ r (cid:2)S . Those tensors are constant along the triangle T P , and the nodal force F TRBSi is related to the first Piola - Kirchhoff stress tensor : F TRBSi ¼ (cid:4)A P TD i ( see proof in Appendix D ) . The law of motion is given by the conservation of linear momentum , which can be written in the reference config - uration with the divergence of tensor T : r (cid:6) T þ (cid:12) R g ð X Þ ¼ (cid:12) d 2 (cid:2) ð X Þ dt 2 ; ð 17 Þ where (cid:12) is the mass density , and R g ð X Þ is a density of body forces ( typically a gravity force ) . To obtain the elastic , body , and acceleration forces at nodal points Q i , it is necessary to obtain the weak form of ( 17 ) , for instance , by invoking the principle of virtual work and to use shape functions (cid:4) i ð X Þ as the test functions [ 32 ] ( see Appendix D for proof ) . If the mass matrix is further constrained to be diagonal ( mass lumping ) , we then get the law of motion for the node i : X T P 2 S P F TRBSi ð T P Þ þ R b ¼ m i d 2 Q i dt 2 : ð 18 Þ 4 A PPROXIMATION OF THE M EMBRANE E NERGY 4 . 1 Small Displacements : Linear Elastic Membrane We propose the first approximation of the membrane energy in the case of small displacements , corresponding to the framework of linear elasticity . In such case , it is preferable to analyze the deformation of a membrane surface in terms of displacement u ð X Þ ¼ (cid:2) ð X Þ (cid:4) X rather than in terms of deformation (cid:2) ð X Þ . The linear elastic membrane energy is derived by replacing the Green - Lagrange strain tensor with its linearized version : E L ¼ 12 ðr u þ r u T Þ . On a linear triangle element , the linear membrane energy is a quadratic expression of the displacements u i of the three vertices ( see [ 6 ] for an equivalent expression of the local stiffness matrix ) : DELINGETTE : TRIANGULAR SPRINGS FOR MODELING NONLINEAR MEMBRANES 335 Fig . 7 . ( a ) Plot of the normalized tensile and angular stiffness as a function of the Poisson ratio . ( b ) Ratio c T P = k T P as a function of the Poisson ratio .

However , it is quite restrictive in practice with the occurrence of exaggerated dilation when large rotations are applied [ 37 ] . Note that when Q i ¼ P i , the TRBS tangent stiffness matrix of ( 16 ) is equal to the linear elastic stiffness matrix . 4 . 2 Small Deformations : Triangular Quadratic Springs A second simplification of the TRBS energy can be done by considering that the amount of deformation of triangle T Q is small , that is , edge lengths l i of T Q are close to rest lengths L i . With this hypothesis , the square edge elongation (cid:3) 2 l i ¼ ð l 2 i (cid:4) L 2 i Þ can be simplified as (cid:3) 2 l i (cid:5) 2 L i ð l i (cid:4) L i Þ . Writing the edge elongation as dl i ¼ l i (cid:4) L i , we can define the TRiangular Quadratic Springs ( TRQS ) as an approximation of TRBS : W TRQS ð T P Þ ¼ X 3 i ¼ 1 1 2 (cid:11) T P i ð dl i Þ 2 þ X i 6¼ j (cid:13) T P k dl i dl j ; ð 19 Þ (cid:11) T P i ¼ 2 L 2 i k T P i ¼ L 2 i ð 2 cot 2 (cid:3) i ð (cid:5) þ (cid:7) Þ þ (cid:7) Þ 8 A P ; (cid:13) T P k ¼ 2 L i L j c T P k ¼ L i L j ð 2 cot (cid:3) i cot (cid:3) j ð (cid:5) þ (cid:7) Þ (cid:4) (cid:7) Þ 8 A P : ð 20 Þ Thus , by adding angular springs to the regular ( tensile ) spring - mass models , largely used in the computer graphics community and by carefully choosing their stiffness para - meters , one can propose a deformable model that is an approximation of a hyperelastic model derived from con - tinuum mechanics . To the best of our knowledge , it is the first time that a theoretical link between spring - mass models and continuum mechanics is established . Without the addition of angular springs , mass - springs models with the right stiffness parameters can at best approximate the behavior of a membrane with (cid:8) ¼ 1 = 3 ( see [ 38 ] for a similar conclusion based on linear elasticity analogy ) . With angular springs , the TRQS model is equivalent to the TRBS model , an isotropic membrane energy for a linear material but only for small deformations of triangles : dl i = L i < 10 percent . However , it is important to stress that a TRQS model is not a model based on continuum mechanics since its energy W TRQS ð T P Þ is not a function of the two strain invariants tr E and tr E 2 . This implies that for large displacements , the behavior of TRQS models may depend on the geometry and topology of the mesh and not only on the material properties . There has been several previous attempts to compare spring - mass models with continuum mechanics . Van Gelder [ 6 ] has proposed to estimate the equivalent stiffness of a spring - mass model by comparing the stiffness matrix of a linear elastic triangle with that of a spring - mass model . His estimation of the stiffness coeffi - cient (cid:11) T P i ¼ E = 2 ð 1 (cid:4) (cid:8) 2 Þð 2 A P ð 1 (cid:4) (cid:8) Þ = L 2 i þ (cid:8) cot (cid:3) i Þ signifi - cantly differs from ( 20 ) , and it has been shown by Baudet [ 39 ] that the behavior of such membrane model is not correct . A major limitation in those attempts to identify the stiffness parameters of spring - mass models from FEM models has been to exclude angular springs . Indeed , the level of material compressibility ( controlled by (cid:8) ) can only be modified independently of the material stiffness ( con - trolled by E ) with the addition of angular springs . Because of this limitation , Baudet [ 39 ] and Wang and Devarajan [ 40 ] have often turned to the estimation of spring stiffness of quadrilateral elements , because it was possible to add “shear springs” along their diagonals . The elastic force of TRQS is computed by computing the derivative of the TRQS energy with respect to the node position Q i : F TRQSi ð T P Þ ¼ (cid:4) @ ~ W TRQS ð T P Þ @ Q i ¼ X j 6¼ i (cid:11) T P j ð dl j Þ Q k (cid:4) Q i l j þ X j 6¼ i ð (cid:13) T P k dl i þ (cid:13) T P i dl k Þ Q k (cid:4) Q i l j : Similarly , the tangent stiffness matrix is computed as (cid:4) @ ~ W P @ Q i @ Q j ¼ (cid:11) T P k dl k þ (cid:13) T P j dl i þ (cid:13) T P i dl j l k I þ (cid:13) T P k l i l j ð Q k (cid:4) Q i Þ (cid:8) ð Q j (cid:4) Q k Þþ (cid:13) T P i l j l k ð Q i (cid:4) Q k Þ (cid:8) ð Q i (cid:4) Q j Þþ (cid:13) T P j l i l k ð Q j (cid:4) Q i Þ (cid:8) ð Q j (cid:4) Q k Þþ (cid:11) T P k L k (cid:4) (cid:13) T P j dl i (cid:4) (cid:13) T P i dl j l 3 k ð Q i (cid:4) Q j Þ (cid:8) ð Q i (cid:4) Q j Þ : 5 I MPLEMENTATION AND R ESULTS 5 . 1 Comparison of Execution Time We have implemented four different elastic membrane formulations in the SOFA platform 2 to benchmark their performance on a laptop computer with a Core Duo T2400 1 . 83 - MHz processor . Those formulations include the linear elastic membrane , the TRQS and TRBS membranes , and a regular spring - mass membrane obtained by dropping the angular springs in the TRQS formulation . To optimize the execution time of the TRBS and TRQS membrane forces , the tensile stiffness (cid:11) T P i and k T P i are stored on edges and are accumulated from adjacent triangles . Thus , the force computation first requires to examine all edges to compute their extensions ( (cid:3) 2 l i and dl i ) and the tensile terms followed by the examination of all triangles to add the angular terms . In the latter case , each edge term may be computed only once by taking advantage of the action - reaction principle ð F i ! j ¼ (cid:4) F j ! i Þ . In Section 3 . 6 , we have showed that the application of the regularfiniteelementorfinitevolumemethod ( suchas [ 41 ] ) is equivalent to the TRBS membrane , but with a formulation of 336 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS , VOL . 14 , NO . 2 , MARCH / APRIL 2008 2 . SOFA is an open source medical simulation platform available at www . sofa - framework . org . the force that involves the first Piola - Kirchhoff tensor : F TRBS i ¼ (cid:4)A P TD i . The computation of the membrane forces for the three vertices of a tridimensional triangle based on FEM requires 97 multiplications and 74 additions , whereas the TRBS forces can be computed with 35 multiplications and 44 additions , 3 which represents at least a speedup factor of two . Thus , the biquadratic spring formulation performs an optimal assembly of the stiffness information . In Fig . 8 , we compare the execution times for the evaluation of the elastic membrane force F i , as well as the matrix - vector product ½ B ij (cid:3) X on a triangular mesh having 774 vertices and 1 , 546 triangles . The matrix - vector product evaluation is useful to benchmark the performance of the conjugated gradient algorithm . The linear elastic membrane is the most efficient , followed by the spring mass , the biquadratic and the quadratic models . The biquadratic model is only 60 percent more expensive than the spring mass , whereas the quadratic model is itself 60 percent more expensive than the biquadratic model . The execution times for the matrix - vector products follow the same hierarchy , but with smaller differences between the models ( the quadratic membrane is only 20 percent more expensive than the biquadratic one in this case ) . 5 . 2 Comparison on Test Cases We compare the behavior of the four membrane formula - tions in a pure traction study for which there is a known analytical solution for linear elastic materials . Fig . 9 summarizes the boundary conditions that consist in applying a known pressure p on the top of a square membrane while preventing the vertical displacements of the bottom vertices . In the linear elastic case , the vertical and horizontal strains , (cid:2) y and (cid:2) x are proportional to the applied pressure : (cid:2) y ¼ E p and (cid:2) x ¼ E (cid:8) p . Several indentation tests have been performed on a membrane material having unit Young Modulus E ¼ 1 and varying Poisson ratios (cid:8) 2 ½ 0 ; 1 ½ . We solve those nonlinear static problems with an implicit method using the tangent stiffness matrices ( Newton - Raphson algorithm ) , each linear system of equations being solved with the modified conjugated gradient by Baraff and Witkin [ 14 ] . In Fig . 10 , the curves p ð (cid:2) y Þ (cid:5) E(cid:2) y and (cid:2) x ð (cid:2) y Þ (cid:5) (cid:4) (cid:8)(cid:2) y are displayed for the linear and the TRBS membranes for a given Poisson ratio (cid:8) ¼ 0 : 6 . Those curves have been computed from the mesh in Fig . 12a . As expected , all curves are linear for small strains , whereas the TRBS membrane leaves the domain of linearity for strain greater than 3 percent . For extensions , p > 0 , TRBS membranes exhibit greater stiffness than linear membranes , whereas the converse is true for compressions . The differences in the stress - strain relationships can be readily explained by the difference between the Green - Lagrange strain ( quadratic function of stretch ) used in the TRBS model and the engineering strain ( linear function of stretch ) for the linear model . Indeed , the curves p ð (cid:2) y Þ closely match the graph dw B = ds in Fig . 3 . For a strong compression , p ¼ (cid:4) 0 : 1 , away from the linear domain (cid:2) x (cid:5) 10 percent , the TRBS membrane exhibits vertical strains that are on the average 20 percent greater than in the linear case ( see Fig . 11 ) . The TRQS membrane has an intermediate behavior between the linear and TRBS membranes , which is sensible since it is a large displace - ment formulation ( as the TRBS case ) , but with a strain measure ( engineering strain ) similar to linear materials . Finally , using tensile springs leads to solutions that are far from being physical except when the Poisson ratio is close to 1 / 3 , which correlates the findings of Section 3 . 4 . The impact of the mesh homogeneity on the computed deformation has been tested by comparing the deformations produced by the TRBS membrane on the two meshes displayed in Fig . 12 . The computed strains were actually very close to each other with a relative difference between strains less than 5 percent ( with an average difference of 1 . 1 percent ) DELINGETTE : TRIANGULAR SPRINGS FOR MODELING NONLINEAR MEMBRANES 337 Fig . 8 .

Pure traction experiment where a constant pressure is applied on a slab , bottom vertices being constrained to have zero vertical displacements . The horizontal and vertical deformations are computed as (cid:2) x ¼ Dx = L and (cid:2) y ¼ Dy = h . 3 . The decomposition of forces based on FEM exploits the fact that all nodal forces of a triangle sum to zero F i þ F j þ F k ¼ 0 . In the case of TRBS , we have assumed that each edge is shared by two triangles . Fig . 10 . Curves p ð (cid:2) y Þ and (cid:2) x ð (cid:2) y Þ for pure traction experiments with TRBS and linear membranes ð (cid:8) ¼ 0 : 6 Þ . for the same applied pressures . Similar results were obtained with the TRQS elastic membrane but with a greater discrepancy ( average of 2 . 54 percent ) . The relative indepen - denceofbehaviorofTRBSwithrespecttomeshresolutionand homogeneity is theoretically guaranteed because , unlike the TRQS , it is based on continuum mechanics . Although additional tests should be performed , the TRQS seems to be also quite insensitive to the mesh topology . Therefore , TRBS and TRQS are very well suited for multigrid [ 42 ] or multi - resolution [ 28 ] , [ 43 ] approaches . 5 . 3 Cloth Animation We simulate below the deformation of a tablecloth under the effect of gravity forces . To this end , we add to the Newtonian law of motion of ( 18 ) , bending and damping forces . For bending , we use the damped formulation by Bridson et al . [ 24 ] because it makes bending forces “orthogonal” to membranes ( tangential ) forces . To damp membrane forces , it is very common in Finite Element analysis to consider a damping matrix proportional to the mass and stiffness matrices ( Rayleigh damping [ 44 ] ) . To optimize computation , we propose in the TRBS case , to replace the square elongation (cid:3) 2 l i with its damped value in ( 15 ) : ð (cid:3) 2 l i Þ Damped ¼ (cid:3) 2 l i þ (cid:14) ð v j (cid:4) v k Þ (cid:6) ð Q j (cid:4) Q k Þ : (cid:14) being the damping coefficient and v j being the speed of vertex j . This simple approach is equivalent to considering a local damping matrix proportional to a modified local stiffness matrix where the terms proportional to the identity matrix in ( 16 ) have been dropped . It is important to note that , in this case , the final damping matrix is still invariant with respect to global rotations . Similarly , for the TRQS case , we replace the edge elongation dl i with its damped value : ð dl i Þ Damped ¼ dl i þ (cid:14) ð v j (cid:4) v k Þ (cid:6) ð Q j (cid:4) Q k Þ k Q j (cid:4) Q k k : The time integration of the law of motion is based on a backward Euler method with membrane forces being integrated implicitly . Linear equations are solved with a conjugated gradient algorithm with no preconditioning . Simulations of a tablecloth falling lying on a table are shown in Fig . 13 for various choices of membranes and Poisson ratios . Those experiments are based on the mesh in Fig . 10a with mass lumping , bending forces set to 0 . 05 , and Young modulus set to 200 . The computation time is around 3 sec on a laptop computer with a Core Duo T2400 1 . 83 - MHz processor . Using a nearly incompressible material (cid:8) ¼ 0 : 95 for both TRBS and TRQS results in fairly regular folds , whereas for low Poisson ratios , the number and the shape folds tends to be much less regular . For (cid:8) ¼ 0 : 95 , the TRBS and TRQS membranes behave very closely , whereas for low Poisson ratios , the amplitude of the folds is greater when the TRQS membrane is employed . As expected , using tensile springs only with (cid:8) ¼ 1 = 3 results in a shape that is fairly close to the TRQS with low Poisson ratio . 6 C ONCLUSION In this paper , we have first showed that tensile quadratic and biquadratic springs correspond to a finite element discretiza - tionofstretchingenergyoncurvesfortwodifferentchoicesof 338 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS , VOL . 14 , NO . 2 , MARCH / APRIL 2008 Fig . 11 .

In the 2D case , two new nonlinear membrane formulations have been introduced : the triangular biquadra - tic and quadratic springs . The TRBS is equivalent to a finite strain membrane material with a linear stress - strain relation ( St Venant - Kirchhoff membrane ) when the discretization is based on linear triangle elements and the finite element method ( see Fig . 14 ) . This set of tensile and angular biquadratic springs leads to efficient computations ( only 60 percent more costly than springs ) . The TRQS membranes are approximations of the TRBS for small deformations and can also be decomposed into tensile quadratic springs ( regular springs ) and angular quadratic springs . TRQS are not isotropic hyperelastic materials since their strain energy do not depend on the strain invariants . However , they can be considered as asymptotically hyperelastic in the same way than linear elastic materials are asymptotically hyperelastic for small displacements . Finally , it has been showed that for Poisson ratio (cid:8) ¼ 1 = 3 , the angular springs may be neglected , and in such case , regular mass - springs models can be used to approximate TRQS membranes . Thus , we have established a formal link between springs , widely used in computer graphics and continuum mechanics through the introduction of biquadratic springs . Further - more , as shown in Section 3 . 3 , any isotropic isotropic hyperelastic membrane can be expressed as a function of the two invariants of the strain tensor and therefore can be expressedintermsoftensile andangularbiquadraticsprings . This study on springs and continuum mechanics should be extended in several directions , for instance , to other planar finite elements such as quads , to the case of 3D elastic materials discretized with tetrahedral or hexahe - dral meshes , or to describe anisotropic materials , especially in the context of cloth or biomechanical modeling .

Relations between the introduced membrane formulations : TRBS , TRQS , and springs . A PPENDIX D D ERIVING THE L AW OF M OTION First , a relation between the energy gradient and the second Piola Kirchhoff stress tensor S is derived from the chain rule of derivation : @ Wp @ Q i ¼ @ Wp @ E @ E @ Q i ¼ A P S @ E @ Q i : Note that @ E @ Q i is a third - order tensor . To simplify the computation , we examine the first component of the energy gradient @ Wp @ Q xi : @ Wp @ Q xi ¼ A P S : @ E @ Q xi ¼ A P 2 S : @ C @ Q xi ; where A : B ¼ tr ð B T A Þ is the inner product of the two matrices . We can further derive the matrix @ C @ Q xi : @ C @ Q xi ¼ X 3 j ¼ 1 Q xj D i (cid:8) D j : If we note that A : ð b (cid:8) c Þ ¼ Ab (cid:6) c , then we have @ Wp @ Q xi ¼ A P X 3 j ¼ 1 Q xj ð SD i Þ (cid:6) D j ¼ A P X 3 j ¼ 1 ðð SD i Þ (cid:6) D j Þ Q xj ; F T P i ¼ (cid:4) @ Wp @ Q i T ¼ (cid:4)A P X 3 j ¼ 1 ðð SD i Þ (cid:6) D j Þ Q j ; F T P i ¼ (cid:4)A P r (cid:2)SD i ¼ (cid:4)A P TD i : Second , we show how the integration of the divergence of the first Piola - Kirchhoff stress tensor provides the same elastic force , as in Section 3 . 5 , where we have simply taken the derivative of the energy with respect to the vertex position Q i . The same expression would have been obtained by applying the finite volume method over the dual barycentric grid , as in [ 46 ] . Indeed , the Rayleigh - Ritz method , the finite element method and the finite volume method all produce the same nodal equations when a linear triangle element is used ( constant strain ) . From the differential ( 17 ) , we build its weak form by invoking the principle of virtual work or the weighted residual method : Z (cid:2) ðr (cid:6) T þ R ð X ÞÞ w dA ¼ Z (cid:2) (cid:12) @ 2 (cid:2) ð X Þ @ t 2 w dA ; where w ð X Þ is a test function that verifies the essential boundary conditions . In the remainder , we consider a vertex P andtheset S P oftrianglesadjacenttothatpoint . Wedefinea test function w ð X Þ as a hat function around P , that is , equal to 0 if X = 2 S P and w ð X Þ ¼ (cid:4) i ð X Þ , if X 2 T P (cid:2) S P . If we only consider the elastic force , we can use the weak form to get the nodal elastic force at point P : Z (cid:2) ðr (cid:6) T Þ w d (cid:2) ¼ X T P 2 S P Z T P ðr (cid:6) T Þ (cid:4) i ð X Þ d (cid:2) ¼ X T P 2 S P F T P i ¼ F i : We can further simplify the previous equation since the divergence satisfies , div ð T w Þ ¼ T r w þ div ð T Þ w : X T P 2 S P Z T P d iv ð T Þ (cid:4) i ð X Þ d (cid:2) ¼ X T P 2 S P Z T P d iv ð T (cid:4) i Þ (cid:4) ð T r (cid:4) i Þ d (cid:2) : However , since (cid:4) i ð X Þ ¼ 0 if X 2 @ S P and according to Green’s theorem the first term of the equation is null : Z Z d iv ð T (cid:4) i Þ dA ¼ Z @ S P ð T (cid:4) i Þ (cid:6) n dl ¼ 0 : The gradient of the shape function r (cid:4) i being D i , we get a simple expression for the nodal force : F i ¼ X T P 2 S P Z d iv ð T Þ (cid:4) i ð X Þ d (cid:2) ¼ X T P 2 S P Z (cid:4)ð T r (cid:4) i Þ d (cid:2) ¼ X T P 2 S P (cid:4)A P TD i : A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The author would like to thank the coauthors of the SOFA platform and , in particular , Je´re´mie Allard , Franc¸ois Faure , Ste´phane Cotin , Pierre - Jean Bensoussan , Franc¸ois Poyer , Christian Duriez , and Laurent Grisoni .
