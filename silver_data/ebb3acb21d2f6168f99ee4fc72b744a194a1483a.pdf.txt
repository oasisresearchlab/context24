Brief Communication 555 The Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein directs actin - based motility by stimulating actin nucleation with the Arp2 / 3 complex Defne Yarar * , Wayne To † , Arie Abo † and Matthew D . Welch * Actin polymerization at the cell cortex is thought to provide the driving force for aspects of cell - shape change and locomotion . To coordinate cellular movements , the initiation of actin polymerization is tightly regulated , both spatially and temporally . The Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) , encoded by the gene that is mutated in the immunodeficiency disorder Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome [ 1 ] , has been implicated in the control of actin polymerization in cells [ 2 – 5 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex , an actin - nucleating factor that consists of seven polypeptide subunits [ 6 – 8 ] , was recently shown to physically interact with WASP [ 9 ] . We sought to determine whether WASP is a cellular activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex and found that WASP stimulates the actin nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro . Moreover , WASP - coated microspheres polymerized actin , formed actin tails and exhibited actin - based motility in cell extracts , similar to those behaviors displayed by the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes . In extracts depleted of the Arp2 / 3 complex , WASP - coated microspheres and L . monocytogenes were non - motile and exhibited only residual actin polymerization . These results demonstrate that WASP is sufficient to direct actin - based motility in cell extracts and that this function is mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex . WASP interacts with diverse signaling proteins and may therefore function to couple signal transduction pathways to Arp2 / 3 - complex activation and actin polymerization .

This suggests that a eukaryotic cellular factor possessing an activity similar to that of ActA might regulate actin polymerization during cell motility by modulating the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex . No such factor has yet been identified , however . We tested whether purified recombinant human WASP tagged with the FLAG epitope ( FLAG – WASP ; Figure 1d ) could stimulate the capacity of the Arp2 / 3 complex to accelerate actin polymerization . Actin - assembly kinetics were monitored using the pyrene – actin assay [ 10 , 11 ] . The polymerization of actin alone was characterized by an initial lag phase , indicative of the kinetic barrier to nuclea - tion , followed by a period of more rapid filament elonga - tion ( Figure 1a ) . Although WASP induces actin polymerization when microinjected into cells [ 4 ] and is thought to bind actin monomers in vitro [ 9 ] , FLAG – WASP had no detectable affect on polymerization kinetics under the conditions tested ( Figure 1a ) . As was observed pre - viously , the Arp2 / 3 complex alone caused a modest accele - ration of polymerization relative to the control , but failed to eliminate or reduce the lag phase [ 7 , 8 ] . Addition of increas - ing amounts of FLAG – WASP with a fixed concentration of the Arp2 / 3 complex , however , caused a dose - dependent acceleration of actin polymerization ( Figure 1b ) . At the highest concentrations of WASP ( a WASP : Arp2 / 3 - complex molar ratio of 4 : 1 ) , the initial rate of actin assembly was up to 35 - fold higher than that in the reactions with the Arp2 / 3 complex or WASP alone , and the lag phase of polymeriza - tion was eliminated ( Figure 1c ) . Thus , WASP stimulates the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , and the Arp2 / 3 complex and WASP together are sufficient for actin - filament nucle - ation . This suggests that WASP may influence the spatial and temporal distribution of actin polymerization in cells by modulating the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex . We sought to examine further the function of WASP in a context that more closely resembled the conditions inside a living cell . The effect of WASP on the nucleating activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex was nearly identical to that of ActA , the L . monocytogenes surface protein that is necessary [ 12 , 13 ] and sufficient to direct actin polymerization in cell cyto - plasm [ 14 – 16 ] . We therefore examined whether WASP - coated beads were sufficient to induce actin polymerization in cell extracts . FLAG – WASP was bound to 1 m m diameter protein - A - conjugated microspheres coated with anti - FLAG antibody . These microspheres were incubated in bovine - brain - extract high - speed supernatant that was sup - plemented with rhodamine - labeled actin to allow actin structures to be visualized by fluorescence microscopy . Clouds of polymerized actin were observed at the surface of 59 ± 4 % ( range 48 – 69 % ; n = 417 ) FLAG – WASP - coated beads ( Figure 2a , b ) . A smaller percentage ( 34 ± 4 % ; range 21 – 44 % ) of FLAG – WASP - coated beads formed actin tails ( Figure 2a , b ) , which were similar in morphology to the tails formed by L . monocytogenes in the same extracts . Control beads coated with an unrelated FLAG - tagged protein ( FLAG – Smad3 [ 17 ] ) did not induce actin polymerization in extracts ( Figure 2c , d ) , indicating that the ability to poly - merize actin is specific to WASP . Because actin - tail formation accompanies L . monocytogenes motility , we used time - lapse microscopy to observe whether tail formation by FLAG – WASP microspheres also correlated with movement . FLAG – WASP microspheres moved at an average rate of 0 . 2 m m / minute ( Figure 2e ) , which was three times slower than the mean rate of L . monocytogenes motility in the extract ( 0 . 6 ± 0 . 1 m m / minute ) . The discrepancy in motility rates may be caused by differences in the size and shape of the moving particles , by the distribution of WASP or ActA on the surface of the particles , or by the fact that ActA may be more efficient than WASP because it competes with WASP for the Arp2 / 3 complex . Nevertheless , the observation that WASP - coated microspheres polymerized actin and moved in cell extracts indicates that WASP is suffi - cient to direct actin - based motility in this context and sug - gests that WASP functions in this capacity in cells . The biochemical interaction between WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro suggested that the ability of WASP to induce actin polymerization in cell extracts was medi - ated by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Similarly , the Arp2 / 3 complex has been proposed to mediate the actin polymerization that is induced by L . monocytogenes [ 6 , 8 ] . To determine the functional importance of the Arp2 / 3 complex , it was removed from extracts by immunodepletion using a mixture of affinity - purified antibodies that recognize three of the seven subunits of the complex : Arp3 , p41 - Arc and p16 - Arc . More than 95 % of the Arp2 / 3 complex was removed from the depleted extract when compared with the control extract , which was mock - depleted using 556 Current Biology , Vol 9 No 10 Figure 1 8 , 000 ( a ) 7 , 000 6 , 000 5 , 000 4 , 000 3 , 000 2 , 000 1 , 000 0 150 300 450 Time ( sec ) 600 750 900 3 1 , 2 8 , 000 ( b ) 7 , 000 6 , 000 5 , 000 4 , 000 3 , 000 2 , 000 1 , 000 0 150 300 450 Time ( sec ) 600 750 900 8 nM 2 nM 40 nM 80 nM 0 nM F l u o r e s cence ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) F l u o r e s cence ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) 8 , 000 ( c ) ( d ) 7 , 000 6 , 000 5 , 000 4 , 000 3 , 000 2 , 000 1 , 000 0 30 60 90 Time ( sec ) Current Biology 120 8 nM 22 31 456697116200 2 nM 40 nM 80 nM 0 nM F l u o r e s cence ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) Effects of the Arp2 / 3 complex and WASP on actin polymerization .

In the control extract , a high percentage of FLAG – WASP micros - pheres ( Figure 3a , h ) and L . monocytogenes ( Figure 3d , i ) polymerized actin clouds and tails . Depletion of the Arp2 / 3 complex abolished actin tail formation by FLAG – WASP microspheres ( Figure 3b , h ) and L . mono - cytogenes ( Figure 3e , i ) . Moreover , depletion greatly reduced the size and fluorescence intensity of actin clouds ( Figure 3b , e ) . Residual actin , which appeared as a faint outline , was observed at the surface of many beads ( Figure 3b , h ) , and a small number of bacteria ( Figure 3e , i ) . The residual actin may have been polymerized by Arp2 / 3 complex remaining in the extract after depletion ( < 5 % of the endogenous pool ) , or by other unknown factors . More - over , in the case of FLAG – WASP microspheres , residual actin may have been bound directly by WASP . To demonstrate that the effect of Arp2 / 3 - complex deple - tion on actin polymerization was indeed caused by the removal of the Arp2 / 3 complex , purified Arp2 / 3 complex was added back to the depleted extracts . Addition of the Arp2 / 3 complex at a concentration comparable to endoge - nous levels ( Figure 3g ) restored the ability of FLAG – WASP beads to polymerize actin clouds and tails in extracts ( Figure 3c , h ) , although , in general , tails were shorter and less abundant than in the control mock - depleted extract . Addition of Arp2 / 3 complex completely restored actin - cloud and actin - tail formation by L . mono - cytogenes ( Figure 3f , i ) . The lower level of rescue of FLAG – WASP - microsphere - based actin - tail formation suggests that bead motility may be more sensitive than L . monocytogenes motility to removal and replacement of the Arp2 / 3 complex , perhaps because of a physical prop - erty of the beads or a more stringent requirement for other factors in the extract . In either case , these findings indi - cate that the Arp2 / 3 complex is necessary for actin - based motility and robust actin polymerization by FLAG – WASP microspheres and L . monocytogenes in bovine - brain extracts . Our results demonstrate that WASP is sufficient to direct actin - polymerization - based motility in cell extracts . More - over , we have shown that WASP works in concert with the Brief Communication 557 Figure 3 The effect of Arp2 / 3 - complex depletion on WASP - bead and L . monocytogenes motility .

WASP may participate indirectly in nucleation by inducing a conformational change in the Arp2 / 3 complex , or directly by providing an additional binding interface for actin . Regulation of the interaction between WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex may be a central control mechanism for modulating the spatial and tempo - ral distribution of actin polymerization in cells . Mutations in the WASP gene cause defects in platelet morphology , macrophage chemotaxis [ 2 , 3 , 5 ] , T - lymphocyte activation and antigen - receptor capping [ 18 ] . Actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex and WASP may thus be critical for these cellular functions . Diverse WASP - family proteins , which include N - WASP [ 19 ] and WAVE / Scar [ 20 , 21 ] , may serve to differentially regulate the Arp2 / 3 complex in distinct cell types . Interestingly , although L . monocytogenes ActA may mimic WASP - family proteins , the Shigella flexneri equivalent , IcsA / VirG , appears to recruit N - WASP to harness the host’s actin cytoskeleton [ 22 ] . WASP contains multiple binding sites for proteins involved in signal transduction , suggesting that it may function to integrate information from a diverse set of signals to acti - vate the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin polymerization . One WASP binding partner is the Rho - family GTPase Cdc42 ( reviewed in [ 23 ] ) , which can induce actin polymerization mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex at the surface of beads in cell extract [ 24 ] . We have been unable to detect any effect of activated Cdc42 on actin nucleation by WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex , however ( M . D . W . and A . A . , unpublished observations ) . Cdc42 may work to regulate the localization of WASP to the plasma membrane or to sites where rapid polymerization is required . The activity and localization of WASP may also be regulated by signalling pathways involving tyrosine kinases ( reviewed in [ 23 , 25 ] ) . Thus , multiple pathways may act in concert to regulate the activ - ity of WASP - family proteins and the Arp2 / 3 complex , and delineation of this set of regulatory interactions will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of cell morphogene - sis , cell locomotion and Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome .

Welch Current Biology 10 May 1999 , 9 : 555 – 558 S1 Supplementary materials and methods Purification of the Arp2 / 3 complex and WASP The Arp2 / 3 complex was purified as described previously [ S1 , S2 ] . Recombinant human FLAG – WASP was expressed in Sf - 9 insect cells using the baculovirus system . FLAG – WASP was partially purified from cell lysates by binding to anti - FLAG monoclonal - antibody M2 affinity gel ( Eastman Kodak ) and eluting with FLAG peptide ( Eastman Kodak ) . Eluted protein was further purified by chromatography on a MonoQ column ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) and subsequently on a superdex - 200 column ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) equilibrated with control buffer for the pyrene – actin assay [ S3 ] . Pyrene – actin assay The pyrene – actin assay was carried out as described previously [ S3 ] with the following exception : monomeric actin that was isolated by cen - trifugation was further purified by chromatography on a superdex - 200 column ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) equilibrated with G buffer [ S3 ] . Preparation of WASP microspheres Monoclonal M2 anti - FLAG antibody ( 12 m g ) was bound to 10 m l of 1 m m diameter protein - A - conjugated microspheres ( Bangs Laborato - ries ) . Microspheres were washed into extract buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 7 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM EDTA , 100 mM sucrose ) . Of the 10 m l sample of microspheres , 5 m l were incubated with 5 m g FLAG – WASP and the other 5 m l with 8 m g FLAG – Smad3 protein [ S4 ] . Coated microspheres were washed and resuspended in extract buffer . WASP - microsphere and L . monocytogenes assays Frozen bovine brain was pulverized and ground in liquid nitrogen , then mixed with an equal volume of extract buffer supplemented with 0 . 5 mM ATP , 1 mM leupeptin , 1 mM chymostatin , 1 mM pepstatin and 0 . 5 mM DTT . Brain high - speed supernatant was obtained by centrifu - gation at 100 , 000 · g for 15 min ( final protein concentration 7 mg / ml ) . Similar extracts have been used to study L . monocytogenes motility [ S5 , S6 ] . To assay for actin polymerization and motility , microspheres or DAPI - labelled L . monocytogenes [ S2 ] were incubated in brain extract supplemented with actin labeled with N - hydroxysuccinimidyl 5 - car - boxytetramethyl rhodamine ( 1 m M ) as described previously [ S1 , S2 ] , except that 0 . 5 % methyl cellulose was also added . Antibody preparation and immunodepletion A polyclonal antibody that recognizes the isoform of p41 - Arc that is expressed in brain , Sop2Hs [ S7 ] , was made by immunizing rabbits with the synthetic peptide CKTLESSIQGLRIM ( in the single - letter amino - acid code ) , which corresponds to the carboxy - terminal 13 amino acids of Sop2Hs . An anti - human - Arp3 antibody was made by immunizing rabbits with the peptide CKRTVDARLKLSEELSGGRLKPK , which cor - responds to amino acids 340 – 361 of Arp3 . An anti - human - p16 - Arc antibody was made by immunizing rabbits with the peptide CKGFE - SPSDNSSAMLLQ , which corresponds to amino acids 112 – 127 of p16 - Arc . Peptide - conjugation , antibody affinity - purification and antibody storage procedures were performed as described previously [ S8 ] . For immunodepletion , random rabbit IgG ( 90 m g ; Jackson Laborato - ries ) , or a combination of anti - Sop2Hs antibody ( 27 m g ) , anti Arp3 ( 340 – 361 ) antibody ( 42 m g ) , and anti - p16 ( 112 – 127 ) antibody ( 35 m g ) was bound to 50 m l Affiprep protein - A beads ( BioRad Labs ) . Beads were washed with extract buffer and then incubated with 60 m l bovine - brain high - speed supernatant for 40 min at 4°C . Beads were pelleted and the supernatant was subjected to one or two more rounds of depletion , yielding the depleted extract . For rescue , 0 . 2 – 1 m l of puri - fied Arp2 / 3 complex was added to the depleted extract . The amount of added Arp2 / 3 complex was quantified by immunoblotting using anti - bodies to p34 - Arc and p21 - Arc [ S9 ] . Supplementary references S1 .
