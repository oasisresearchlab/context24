A variety of respiratory viruses produce infections in humans with effects ranging from asymptomatic to life - treath - ening . Standard surveillance systems typically only target severe infections ( ED outpatients , hospitalisations , deaths ) and fail to track asymptomatic or mild infections . Here we performed a large - scale community study across multiple age groups to assess the pathogenicity of 18 respiratory viruses . We enrolled 214 individuals at multiple New York City locations and tested weekly for respiratory viral pathogens , irrespective of symptom status , from fall 2016 to spring 2018 . We combined these test results with participant - provided daily records of cold and flu symptoms and used this information to characterise symptom severity by virus and age category . Asymptomatic infection rates exceeded 70 % for most viruses , excepting influenza and human metapneumovirus , which produced significantly more severe outcomes . Symptoms were negatively associated with infection frequency , with children displaying the lowest score among age groups . Upper respiratory manifestations were most common for all viruses , whereas systemic effects were less typical . These findings indicate a high burden of asymptomatic respiratory virus infection exists in the general population . Introduction Respiratory viral infections are a leading cause of disease worldwide , affecting all age groups and representing a serious threat to human health , particularly for infants , older adults and the immunocompromised . The effects of infection on individuals can vary considerably and include completely asymptomatic manifestations , mild upper respiratory effects and severe symptoms requiring hospitalisation . The epidemiology of respiratory viral infections is generally analysed through passive symptom - based surveillance . When studying the burden of infection , many observational studies focus on severe outcomes , such as cardiac and pulmonary complications in hospita - lised patients [ 1 – 4 ] , or the role of respiratory viruses in the exacerbation of pre - existing respiratory conditions [ 5 – 7 ] . Additionally , community - based longitudinal studies have gener - ally been restricted to young children or households and involve the sampling of specimens to identify viruses after an index symptomatic episode occurs [ 8 – 10 ] . Investigation of the prevalence and effects of respiratory viral infections in the broader population , not just among individuals seeking medical attention , is needed to more fully understand the burden of these infections within the community and to develop adequate pre - ventive measures against these pathogens . In particular , the proportion of the population that is infected and yet does not develop symptoms must be determined to better quantify trans - mission risk , forecast future disease incidence and pathogen spread , and support public health response efforts . Here , we document rates of asymptomatic respiratory virus infection through a large - scale community study across multiple age groups . We use data from a cohort of individuals who were tested weekly for respiratory viruses irrespective of symptom status . We combine these test results with participant - provided daily records of cold and flu symp - toms and use this information to characterise symptom outcomes by virus and age category . Methods Cohort composition and survey We enrolled 214 individuals from multiple locations in Manhattan borough , New York City . We refer to the participants as healthy as they were enrolled from the general population , as opposed to individuals seeking clinical care . The cohort included children attending two daycares , along with their siblings and their parents , teenagers and teachers from a high school , adults working at two emergency departments ( a paediatric ER and an adult ER ) , and adults working at a university medical centre . The study period spanned 2 years from October 2016 to April 2018 with some individuals enrolled for a single cold and flu sea - son ( October – April ) and others for the entire period . All indivi - duals from the selected facilities who were willing to participate were enrolled in the study . Enrolled individuals were asked to complete a baseline survey and provide two nasopharyngeal swab samples ( one from each nostril ) . Following this preliminary step , two nasopharyngeal samples were again collected weekly from each participant irrespective of symptoms . The baseline question - naire completed at the time of enrolment included information on ethnicity , general health , daily habits , travel history and house - hold structure . For the entire duration of the study , participants provided a daily report rating nine respiratory illness - related symptoms ( fever , chills , muscle pain , watery eyes , runny nose , sneezing , sore throat , cough , chest pain ) , which were recorded on a Likert scale ( 0 = none , 1 = mild , 2 = moderate , 3 = severe ) . Participants were also asked to note if they had sought medical attention , stayed home or taken influenza - like illness ( ILI ) - related medications as a consequence of their listed symptoms . Parents provided consent , baseline questionnaire answers and the daily survey information for their enrolled children . A total daily score was generated for each participant by summing the scores of the individual symptoms ( total daily score ranges from 0 to 27 ) . Details on the participants are summarised in Table 1 . Specimen collection and analysis Two nasopharyngeal samples per participant were collected on a weekly basis using minitip flocked swabs . Both samples were stored jointly in 2 ml DNA / RNA Shield ( Zymo Research , Irvine , CA , USA ) at 4 – 25 °C for up to 30 days and then stored at − 80 °C in two aliquots . Nucleic acids were extracted from 200 µl of sam - ple and 10 µl of internal control using the EasyMAG NucliSENS system ( bioMerieux , Durham , NC , USA ) . Samples were then screened for viruses using the eSensor XT - 8 respiratory viral panel ( RVP ; GenMark Dx , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) [ 4 ] , a multiplex PCR assay . The RVP system separately detects influenza A ( any subtype , A / H1N1 , A / H3N2 , A / H1N1pdm2009 ) and B ; RSV A and B ; parainfluenza ( PIV ) 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ; human metapneumo - virus ( HMPV ) ; human rhinovirus ( HRV ) ; adenovirus B / E and C ; and coronaviruses ( CoV ) 229E , NL63 , OC43 and HKU1 . Samples positive for a particular virus were identified by an elec - trical signal intensity of ⩾ 2 nA / mm 2 ( with the exception of CoV OC43 for which positive results were identified by an intensity of ⩾ 25 nA / mm 2 , per manufacturer specifications ) . Statistical analysis We classified all specimens , irrespective of result , as symptomatic or asymptomatic according to the individual symptom score in the days surrounding the date of swab collection . We used mul - tiple definitions as a standard for symptomatic infection does not exist . Definitions are summarised in Table 2 : definitions 1 – 4 consider a time window of 7 days around the day of the collec - tion , whereas definitions 5 – 8 use a window of 11 days . While some definitions use raw metrics , definitions 4 and 8 normalise scores by the average symptom score for each participant ( average weekly total symptom scores for each participant ranged from 0 to 39 ) . We refer to infections that do not satisfy one or more speci - fied definitions as asymptomatic infections . The association between reporting respiratory symptoms and testing positive was calculated with the χ 2 test . A ‘ symptomatic week ’ was defined as a calendar week where the total symptom score was ⩾ 10 . Analyses were conducted using the total number of positive samples , as well as the number of illness - events . We defined an illness - event as a group of consecutive weekly swab specimens for a given individual that were positive for the same virus ( allow - ing for a 1 - week gap to account for false negatives and temporary low shedding ) . The effects of different viruses and the severity of symptoms among different age groups were assessed using analysis of vari - ance ( ANOVA ) . The χ 2 statistic was also used to assess pairwise differences . Participants were divided into four groups : children ( under 10 years of age ) , teenagers ( 10 – 17 years of age ) , adults with daily contact with children ( parents and pediatric ER doc - tors ) and adults without daily contact with children . To assign adult participants to the correct category , we used information on household composition derived from the initial questionnaire . In the analysis of symptoms by virus , specimens positive for more than one virus were excluded . To analyse the specific effects of different viruses , we grouped symptoms into upper respiratory symptoms ( runny nose , sneezing , sore throat , watery eye ) , lower respiratory symptoms ( cough , chest pain ) and systemic symptoms ( fever , chills , muscle pain ) . Results Of the 4215 nasopharyngeal samples collected , 737 ( 17 . 5 % ) were positive for one or multiple respiratory viruses . Among the posi - tive results , between 69 % and 74 % of the samples were classified as asymptomatic depending on the chosen definition ( Table 2 ) . Overall , 55 % of positive specimens were asymptomatic by all defi - nitions . Testing positive for one or more respiratory viruses was associated with an increased likelihood of being symptomatic ( P < 0 . 0001 ) ; however , for the majority of symptomatic weeks ( 67 % ) , RVP did not identify the presence of any respiratory virus . There was a weak association between pre - existing respiratory con - ditions ( asthma , allergies ) and the likelihood of experiencing symp - tomatic infections . However , the association was significant only for some definitions , and the effect on symptom score was marginally significant ( P = 0 . 08 ANOVA ) . Coinfections accounted for 10 % of positive samples and were found most frequently among children ; they occurred throughout the year and were predominantly a combination of HRV and adenovirus . Pairwise comparisons between single infections and coinfections across all eight definitions showed that testing posi - tive for multiple viruses was not associated with more severe symptoms . Among the viruses considered , influenza and HMPV were associated with significantly higher symptom scores than RSV , HRV , CoV , adenovirus and PIV . As shown in Figure 1 , more than 50 % of influenza and HMPV infections were classified as symptomatic by a majority of definitions , whereas the other viruses were mostly asymptomatic according to all definitions ( P < 0 . 01 and P < 0 . 001 when comparing , respectively , the ratio of symptomatic influenza and HMPV infections to the other viral infections ) . The analysis of specific symptoms confirmed the higher sever - ity of influenza and HMPV for lower , upper and systemic 2 M . Galanti et al . symptoms ( Fig . 2a ) . Upper respiratory symptoms were most commonly associated with positive results for all viruses and for all age groups , followed by lower respiratory symptoms and then systemic symptoms ( Fig . 2a and b ) . Infected children showed a similar percentage of upper and lower respiratory symptoms , and teenagers showed a similar percentage of lower respiratory and systemic symptoms . The majority of HMPV infections pre - sented with both upper and lower respiratory symptoms . Higher severity of symptoms was not associated with higher frequency of infection . Figure 3 shows that while children were most frequently infected with a respiratory virus ( they presented with the highest number of viral shedding events per season ) , they recorded ( as reported by their parents ) the lowest symptom scores on average . Adults without daily contact with children reported the highest symptom score ( the difference was signifi - cant only between children and adults without contacts with children , P = 0 . 003 ) . This finding holds when controlling for length of infection , as longer - lasting infections were more fre - quent in children . Discussion Host response to respiratory viruses is heterogeneous : some pre - sumed infections , measured by detectable shedding of virus , exhibit no symptoms or signs of disease , whereas others result in more serious symptoms .

We have already shown in previous studies that respiratory viral infections are widespread within the community throughout the year [ 11 – 13 ] . In [ 11 ] we showed that most individuals , particularly children and their close Fig . 1 . Symptoms by virus . The bars show the fraction of positive results associated with a symptomatic definition ( Table 2 ) . The total number of infections with each virus is reported ( co - infections are excluded from the individual virus counts but are included in the all positive category ) . Same colour / different filling bars pair corresponding definitions that span different time windows . Fig . 2 . Specific symptoms per ( a ) virus and ( b ) age group . Here infection events ( not positivity counts ) are analysed . A viral event is considered positive for upper respiratory , lower respiratory or systemic symptoms if the individual reported at least one of the characterizing symptoms during the 7 days surrounding the test date .

Galanti et al . contacts , contract multiple respiratory infections per year . Here , we analysed the symptoms reported by the same infected indivi - duals and characterised them by virus and by age group . The presence of respiratory symptoms was associated with testing positive for one or more respiratory viruses . However , the majority of symptomatic manifestations were not paired with a positive RVP result . The origin of these symptomatic , nega - tive RVP results could be due to allergies , bacterial infections or potential viral infections with pathogens that have not yet been identified or for which the viral panel does not test . One of the main goals of this analysis was to estimate the asymptomatic ratio , that is , the fraction of infections occurring without symptoms . The asymptomatic ratio is an important indicator for constraining both true respiratory virus preva - lence within a community and the potential for further disease transmission [ 14 ] . Asymptomatic carriers can , in fact , contrib - ute to disease spread by generating ( possibly symptomatic ) sec - ondary infections . Estimates of the asymptomatic ratio vary widely not only across diseases ( from 95 % of polio virus infec - tions to < 10 % of measles ) , but also within the same disease due to different diagnostic testing procedures ( PCR vs . serological tests [ 15 ] ) and sampling approaches ( household vs . longitu - dinal studies ) . Among respiratory viruses , the role of asymptomatic infection is poorly understood . For influenza alone , the prevalence of asymptomatic infection has been estimated to be as low as 9 . 4 % and as high as 90 % depending on the virus type , study , season and definition of asymptomatic infection [ 15 , 16 ] . There is also some evidence that viral shedding correlates with symptom sever - ity and that the contagiousness of asymptomatic individuals is less than for symptomatic persons [ 17 , 18 ] . The rationale is that respiratory symptoms ( coughing , sneezing , runny nose ) help spread pathogens through droplet transmission , either inhaled or settled [ 19 ] . However , the absence of symptoms might bring asymptomatic infected individuals into greater contact with sus - ceptible persons outside the home . This is particularly true for infants and toddlers whose behaviour , hygiene habits and close physical contact typically favour the spread of germs , especially in childcare settings . Whether greater contact occurs and makes asymptomatic individuals effectively as contagious as symptomatic persons is not known . An additional difficulty is that a standard , accepted definition of symptomatic infection does not exist . Further , perception of symptoms is highly subjective , and it may be difficult to assess whether a symptom is caused by the pathogen . For example , chronic symptoms can occur – runny nose is a com - mon sign in children that does not necessary imply viral infection – and allergies can cause sneezing . Fever , muscle pain and chills may also be caused by infections other than respiratory viruses . For these reasons , we adopted multiple definitions of ‘ symptomatic epi - sodes ’ , including personalised metrics . More than half of the RSV , adenovirus , PIV , CoV and HRV infections documented here were asymptomatic according to all definitions . Influenza and HMPV infections caused significantly more symptoms than these other viruses ; however , given its high prevalence , HRV was responsible for more than half of symptom - atic episodes . In general , all viral infections presented with similar symptoms , with upper respiratory manifestations being more fre - quent , whereas systemic symptoms such as fever , muscle pain and chills were less typical . For surveillance in which ILI ( defined as fever plus cough and / or sore throat ) is used to record respiratory infections among people seeking care , this constraint may mean that many viral infections go undetected . Consistent with previous findings [ 20 , 21 ] we did not find an association between viral co - infection and the likelihood of being symptomatic or pre - senting with more severe symptoms . Regardless of the definition , our findings underscore the extremely high proportion of respira - tory viral infections that are asymptomatic . Further analysis is required to capture the role played by asymptomatic individuals in outbreak transmission dynamics , specifically the relative infec - tiousness of asymptomatic vs . symptomatic infections . There was considerable heterogeneity in individual immune response : some individuals seemed to be consistently less predis - posed to developing respiratory symptoms upon viral infection , whereas others were always symptomatic when testing positive . Infections in children were less symptomatic than in adults , even though children proved to be more frequently infected with respiratory viruses [ 11 ] . Frequent infections may enhance the ability of the immune system to identify and respond to pathogens ; hence , the group subjected to the fewest respiratory viral infections ( adults without children ) reported the highest average symptom scores . However , the apparent lower pathogen - icity among children may simply be an artefact introduced due to parents reporting symptoms for their children . Some symptoms , such as sore throat , muscle pain and chest pain , are difficult to identify in young children , and in fact they were less reported in this age category than among adults and teenagers . This pos - sible bias in the reporting of symptoms is one limitation of our study . The daycare and workplace connections among some indi - viduals in our cohort are another possible bias : some infections were likely caused by the same strain ; thus the symptom profiles could be due to specific features of the pathogen rather than indi - vidual immune response . Further , all the children in our cohort were attending daycare or were siblings of children attending day - care . Interactions within the daycare setting could be a confoun - der in this analysis . Future studies should investigate the genetic basis of heterogeneity in host response to respiratory virus infec - tion in order to identify the regulatory pathways controlling reac - tions to these infections . Moreover , longitudinal studies of this type , involving large networks of connected individuals , are needed to assess the role of asymptomatic infections in the trans - mission of respiratory viruses .
