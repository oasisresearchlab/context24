To char - acterize and compare EpiSCs with different origins , we derived a series of EpiSC lines from pregastrula stage to late - bud - stage mouse embryos . We found that the transcriptomes of these cells are hierar - chically distinct from those of the embryonic stem cells , induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) , and epiblast / ectoderm . The EpiSCs display globally similar gene expression proﬁles irrespective of the original developmental stage of the source tissue . They are developmentally similar to the ectoderm of the late - gastrula - stage embryo and behave like anterior primitive streak cells when differentiated in vitro and in vivo . The EpiSC lines that we derived can also be categorized based on a correlation between gene expression signature and predis - position to differentiate into particular germ - layer derivatives . Our ﬁndings therefore highlight distinct identifying characteristics of EpiSCs and provide a foundation for further examination of EpiSC proper - ties and potential . INTRODUCTION Epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) are self - renewing multipotent stem cells that can be derived from the epiblast of postimplantation mouse embryos ( Brons et al . , 2007 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . In contrast to mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) , EpiSCs are inefﬁcient in contributing to the tissue of chimeras following blas - tocyst injection , show less active expression of ‘‘naive’’ pluripo - tency - related genes , and exhibit increased Oct4 occupancy of the proximal enhancer of Pou5f1 ( Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . Like human ESCs , EpiSCs are dependent on FGF / ERK and Activin ( Nodal ) / Smad signaling activities for derivation and maintenance ( Vallier et al . , 2009a , 2009b , 2009c ) . EpiSCs derived from E5 . 5 to E6 . 5 epiblast display the gene expression characteristics of gastrula - stage epiblast / ectoderm ( epi / ect ) ( Brons et al . , 2007 ; Hayashi et al . , 2011 ; Iwafuchi - Doi et al . , 2012 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . EpiSCs show monoallelic expres - sion of imprinted genes ( Sun et al . , 2012 ) and display X - inactiva - tion in XX lines ( Bao et al . , 2009 ; Guo et al . , 2009 ; Hayashi et al . , 2008 ) . The presence of histone methylation marks in the Stella ( Dppa3 ) , Otx2 , Rex1 , and Fbxo15 loci ( Bao et al . , 2009 ; Hayashi and Surani , 2009 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) further suggests that EpiSCs are distinct from mESCs . EpiSCs are multipotent and can generate a multitude of germ - layer - derived tissues in teratomas and during in vitro differentiation . Although there are variations in the neural potential among EpiSC lines ( Bernemann et al . , 2011 ) , they readily differentiate into neuronal lineages after removal of supporting growth factors ( Iwafuchi - Doi et al . , 2012 ; Najm et al . , 2011b ) . When grafted into gastrula - stage mouse embryo , EpiSCs were incorporated into the derivatives of all three germ layers ( Huang et al . , 2012 ) , revealing that the EpiSCs may be the in vitro equivalent of gastrula - stage epiblast cells . However , not all cells display similar lineage potential . A subset of cells ( 0 . 1 % – 0 . 5 % of the colony ) exhibit occupancy of the distal enhancer of Pou5f1 gene that is characteristic of the naive plurip - otency state and are able to contribute to chimeras like the ESCs ( Han et al . , 2010 ) . Also , some cells in the EpiSC colonies express Stella and are competent to produce primordial germ cells in vitro ( Hayashi et al . , 2008 ; Hayashi and Surani , 2009 ) . These cells therefore may retain the potency of germ cell formation and are functionally similar to the epiblast at ( or before ) E6 . 25 – E6 . 5 in vivo when germ cells are speciﬁed ( Ohinata et al . , 2009 ) . Recently , it has been shown that EpiSCs can be derived from mouse embryos of a wide range of developmental stages from E3 . 5 blastocysts ( Najm et al . , 2011a ) and from epi / ect of E6 . 5 – E8 . 0 presomite - stage embryos ( Osorno et al . , 2012 ) . It is not clear if EpiSCs derived from these cellular sources display similar or different states of pluripotency and lineage character - istics . In this study , we examined the molecular properties and the differentiation potential of EpiSCs generated from embryos Cell Stem Cell 14 , 107 – 120 , January 2 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 107 Figure 1 .

Interestingly , we found that EpiSCs derived from epi / ect of different developmental stages display similar transcriptome characteristics that are most closely related to the late - gastrulation - stage ectoderm . EpiSCs also display the properties of the anterior primitive streak . Further - more , speciﬁc EpiSC lines have an inherently different propen - sity for germ - layer differentiation , which could be related to the expression of a signature gene set . Our study has therefore pinpointed the ectoderm cells of late - gastrulation - stage embryo as the in vivo developmental counterparts of EpiSCs and identiﬁed salient features of the cellular and molecular pheno - types of EpiSCs that may correlate with their germ - layer differen - tiation potential and their resemblance to the anterior primitive streak . RESULTS EpiSCs Display Stable Stem Cell Characteristics EpiSCs were generated using 77 explants of epi / ect of postim - plantation mouse embryos at developmental stages between pregastrulation ( E5 . 5 ) to late - bud ( E8 . 25 ) stage ( Figure 1A ; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures , Staging of Embryos available online ; Downs and Davies , 1993 ; Rivera - Pe´rez et al . , 2010 ) . Twenty - nine lines were established ( Figure 1B ) , giving an overall efﬁciency rate of 37 . 7 % ( similar to that reported for pre - to early - streak - stage epiblast : Brons et al . , 2007 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . The efﬁciency was higher ( 40 % – 60 % ) for the epi / ect of pre - to midgastrula stages ( cavity to late mid streak ) and lower ( 10 % – 20 % ) for late - gastrula stages ( late streak to late bud ) . No stable lines were established from ectoderm of em - bryos at the head fold stage or later . The expression of pluripotency factors ( Pou5f1 and Nanog : Figure 1C ; Oct4 , Nanog , Sox2 , and SSEA - 1 : Figure 1D ) did not vary signiﬁcantly among EpiSC lines . All EpiSC lines generated teratomas containing a multitude of germ - layer - derived tissues ( Figure 1E ) . In contrast to the teratomas generated from ESCs , EpiSC teratomas contained more abundant b III tubulin - positive neural tissue but less smooth muscle actin positive tissue ( Figure 1E ) . The relative propor - tion of tissue types found in the EpiSC - derived teratomas was compared to that of whole neonate ( day 1 ) mice ( Fig - ure 1F ) . qPCR analysis of the expression level of tissue - speciﬁc gene expression showed that the teratomas contained more abundant ectoderm tissues ( Nestin and Tubb3 ) , less meso - derm tissues ( Myf5 and Wt1 ) , and similar amount of endoderm tissues ( Hnf4 , Ttr , Pyy , and Claudin6 ) compared with the neo - nate mice . Phenotypic stability of EpiSC lines was assessed by telomere length maintenance . The telomere lengths of EpiSC lines ( at 12th to 18th passages ) were between 28 . 0 and 41 . 0 kb pairs ( Fig - ure S1A ) , which were similar to those of MEFs , shorter than mESCs ( z 50 kb ) ( Varela et al . , 2011 ) and longer than differenti - ated tissues ( z 20 kb ) such as lung ( Figure S1A ) , heart , liver , kid - ney , and spleen ( data not shown ) . We examined if telomere length may be maintained by a combination of trimming and telo - merase - mediated lengthening activity . None of the EpiSC lines or the mESCs examined displayed any telomere trimming that would be detected by the presence of T - circles ( Pickett et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast , T - circles were present in terminally differenti - ated tissues such as the liver ( Figure S1B ) . Telomerase enzyme activity was detected by TRAP assay in both mESCs and EpiSCs ( Figure S1C ) . However , mTert expression , which is tightly linked to telomerase activity , was lower in EpiSCs than ESCs ( Fig - ure S1D ) . Karyotype analysis of 23 EpiSC lines showed that 17 lines ( 73 . 9 % ) had the normal number of 40 chromosomes in over 70 % of metaphases ( Figure S1E ) . A comparison of the tran - scriptome of EpiSCs revealed that the gene expression proﬁle was remarkably consistent among triplicate cultures of individual lines , and the transcriptome of two EpiSC lines derived from different halves of one embryo remained similar to each other after ten passages ( Figure S1F ) . Several EpiSC lines were cryo - preserved and re - established in culture as triplicate cultures . The transcriptomes of these sublines were hierarchically separated from the parental lines but were still consistent among the tripli - cates ( Figure S1F ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings highlight that the EpiSCs display stable stem cell properties and are multipo - tent for germ - layer differentiation . EpiSCs Derived from Epiblast / Ectoderm of Different Developmental Stages Display Similar Transcriptomes The hypothesis underpinning our study is that EpiSCs are different from other pluripotent stem cells and that EpiSCs derived from epi / ect of embryos of different developmental stages are inherently different in their cellular and molecular characteristics , which reﬂect those of the source tissue . This was tested by analyzing the transcriptomes of the EpiSCs , mESCs , and mouse iPSCs ( miPSCs ) ( Figure 2A ) . Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the transcriptomes showed that EpiSCs were clustered in a group different from the mESCs ( C ) Expression of P ou5f1 and Nanog relative to Actb in D Ct determined by qPCR ( n = 3 ) for EpiSC lines derived from epi / ect of CAV - , PS - , LMS - , and LB - stage embryos and the EpiSC9 line from Dr .

EpiSC lines were not clustered in relation to the original developmental stages but scattered across the hierar - chical group . An established EpiSC line ( EpiSC9 , Najm et al . , 2011b ) also clustered with our set of EpiSC lines , and it displayed a similar transcriptome when maintained independently in two laboratories ( Figure 2A ) , further attesting the stability of EpiSCs . Our transcriptome data strongly suggest that EpiSCs derived from epi / ect of embryos at different developmental stage acquire similar transcriptome characteristics after they were established in vitro and that there is no evident correlation of the molecular properties of the EpiSCs with the developmental stages of the source tissue . EpiSCs Display Gene Expression Proﬁles that Are Similar to the Ectoderm of Late - Gastrula - Stage Embryos In order to pinpoint the in vivo developmental stage that EpiSCs are most closely related to , the transcriptomes of EpiSCs were compared to those of epi / ect of cavity ( CAV ) , prestreak ( PS ) , late mid streak ( LMS ) , late streak ( LS ) , no bud ( OB ) , early bud ( EB ) , and late - bud ( LB ) - stage embryos . We ﬁrst performed a principal component analysis ( PCA ) and observed that the epi / ect were aligned in a developmental order along the PC2 axis ( Figure 2B ) . In this axis , the CAV - and PS - stage epiblast samples that clustered closely were indistinguishable from each other . CAV and PS epiblast were clustered separately from both the LMS and LS epi / ect . The LMS - LS epi / ect were positioned sepa - rately from EB and LB epi / ect on the PC2 axis , with the OB ect / epi in between them ( Figure 2B ) . The alignment of these epi / ect transcriptomes therefore delineates a developmental axis of gastrulation . Because the epi / ect samples for the microarray analysis were subject to linear ampliﬁcation , triplicate RNA samples from four EpiSC lines ( CAV2 , PS5 , LMS3 , and LB2 ) sourced from different developmental stages and that clustered separately ( Figure 2A ) were similarly ampliﬁed for comparison . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) of the whole transcriptome data set revealed that the epi / ect and ampliﬁed EpiSCs clustered separately along the PC1 axis ( Figure 2B ) . Relative to epi / ect , the ampliﬁed EpiSC samples were enriched for gene transcripts associated with cell adhesion , matrix production , and signaling activity of the transforming growth factor ( TGF ) - b , MAPK , and WNT pathways but displayed lower expression of genes associated with chro - matin modiﬁcation and transcriptional regulation ( Figure 2B ) . A comparison of the differentially expressed genes between the epi / ect and all unampliﬁed EpiSC samples revealed an expanded list of transcripts associated with the same categories of cellular function , signaling , and transcription regulatory activ - ity as those of the ampliﬁed EpiSC samples ( Figure 2B ) . These results showed that the ampliﬁcation step has not signiﬁcantly altered the outcome of the transcriptome analysis and that the Figure 2 .

In the PC2 axis , the position of the ampliﬁed EpiSC lines over - lapped with the unampliﬁed EpiSC lines , and they were posi - tioned between LS and EB / LB stages in the developmental axis ( Figures 2B ) . To further evaluate the signiﬁcance of the PCA presentation of developmental progression , we examined the differentially expressed genes identiﬁed in the epi / ect by probe loadings along PC2 axis ( Figure 3 ) . In this axis , the bottom 1 % negative - related probes ( n = 316 ) that were associated with the epiblast of younger developmental stages were mainly regu - lators of RNA processing ( Figure 3 ) . In contrast , the top 1 % positive - related probes that were associated with the epi / ect of the advanced developmental stages were genes related to lineage commitment ( Figure 3 ) . The distribution of the epi / ect samples along the PC2 axis therefore correlates with the progression of development . When the transcriptomes of the EpiSC lines ( ampliﬁed and unampliﬁed samples , including the EpiSC9 line ) were mapped to this developmental axis , they were found in a normal distribution ( by Shapiro - Wilk test ) around the no bud stage ( Figure 3 ) . This ﬁnding suggests that the EpiSCs may be developmentally equivalent to the ectoderm cells of the late - gastrula - stage embryo .

The developmental proﬁle of the expres - sion of these genes followed four distinc - tive stage - related patterns : ( 1 ) lineage commitment : progressively increasing expression , ( 2 ) neuroectoderm differenti - ation : gradual followed by elevated expression , ( 3 ) pluripotency related : rapid followed by slow decline in expression , and ( 4 ) maintenance of epiblast during development : progressively decreasing expression ( Figures 4A and S2 ) . Gene ontology ( GO ) analysis of these genes revealed similar terms and identity to those that signify the developmental axis identiﬁed by PCA ( Fig - ures 3 and 4B ) . Heatmaps of the expression proﬁles ( Figure 4A ) and the expression levels ( Figure S2A ) of these developmentally regulated genes in ampliﬁed EpiSC samples indicated that they matched most closely with those of the epi / ect between LS and EB / LB stages ( Figure 4C ) . Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the whole transcriptome also showed that these EpiSC lines clustered closely with OB - to LB - stage ectoderm and were hier - archically separated from CAV and PS epiblast ( Figure S2B ) . These results therefore point to a strong likelihood that the EpiSCs derived from embryos of different postimplantation stages have converged to a cellular state comparable to the epi / ect of embryos at the late - gastrula stages . EpiSCs Acquire Anterior Primitive Streak Properties The ﬁnding of the enhanced expression of genes related to FGF / MAPK , WNT , and Activin / GDF / Nodal signaling ( Figures 2B and S2A ) raised the possibility that EpiSCs might have acquired cellular properties that are characteristic of the primitive streak . To follow up this observation , we mined the EpiSCs and epi / ect transcriptomes for an annotated set of genes that are ex - pressed in the primitive streak of the mouse and the chick embryos ( Alev et al . , 2010 ; Pﬁster et al . , 2007 ) . This analysis re - vealed that many genes of the anterior mesendoderm and deﬁn - itive endoderm ( AME / ADE ) ( Lefty1 , Cited2 , Cer1 , Lbh , and Cell Stem Cell EpiSCs Display Anterior Primitive Streak Properties Cell Stem Cell 14 , 107 – 120 , January 2 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 111 Sox17 ) and anterior primitive streak ( Sfrp1 , Foxa2 , Chrd , Acvr1b , and Fzd8 ) of the late - gastrula embryo were expressed higher in EpiSCs than the epi / ect .

Cdx4 , Eomes , and Evx1 , was signiﬁcantly lower in EpiSCs ( Fig - ure 5A ) . These results suggest that some cells in the EpiSC lines have acquired the molecular and signaling properties of primitive streak cells , with a bias toward those of the anterior primitive streak . To test if the EpiSCs behave like the native primitive streak cells of the gastrulating embryo , EpiSCs were assessed for their pattern of tissue colonization following grafting into the midseg - ment of the primitive streak of OB / EB - stage ( E7 . 5 ) embryos . Eight EpiSC lines ( CAV1 , CAV2 , CAV3 , CAV4 , PS3 , LMS1 , LMS4 , and LMS5 ) were tested . After 24 hr of in vitro develop - ment , descendants of the EpiSCs ( marked by the lipophilic CM - DiI ﬂuorescent dye ) were found to have dispersed from the graft site and incorporated into the germ - layer tissues of the Figure 5 .

Cells derived from the grafts were distributed along the body axis of the host em - bryo after 24 hr of culture ( Figures 5C and 5D – 5I ) . EpiSCs grafted to anterior and middle sites showed a higher rate of incorporation than the posterior site . EpiSCs from the anterior site dispersed anteriorly and colonized the foregut invagination and the midline mesendoderm ( Figures 5D and 5E ) . Cells grafted into the middle segment of the primitive streak populated the paraxial and lateral mesoderm , extending from midtrunk to the level of the posterior intestinal portal ( Figures 5F and 5G ) . In contrast , EpiSCs grafted to the posterior site tended to clump ( Figures S3A and S3B ) . This clumping phenotype may reﬂect the lower compatibility of the EpiSCs with the posterior primitive streak .

Histological examination revealed proper inte - gration of the EpiSC - derived cells in the tissues of all three germ layers including the neural plate ( Figure 5J ) , the paraxial mesoderm ( Figure 5K ) , the notochord ( Figure 5L ) , and the deﬁn - itive endoderm ( Figure 5M ) . EpiSCs that were integrated in the primitive streak initiated T expression ( Figure 5N ) and those in the mesoderm and the notochord expressed T strongly ( Figures 5N , 5O , and S3C ) . EpiSC - derived cells in the primitive streak did not express Foxa2 but did so when they were incorporated into the precursor of the notochord ( Figure S3D ) . EpiSC - derived cells in the endoderm expressed Sox17 and Foxa2 ( Figures 5P , 5Q , and S3E – S3H ) . EpiSCs therefore expressed appropriate lineage markers when they were incorporated into the host tissues . The morphogenetic behavior and the pattern of tissue colonization displayed by the EpiSCs are reminiscent of cells of the anterior primitive streak of the late - streak - stage embryo ( Kinder et al . , 1999 ) . This further indicated that , consistent with the transcrip - tome characteristics , EpiSCs might have acquired the properties of the anterior primitive streak cells . Temporal Gene Expression Pattern during Short - Term Differentiation Reﬂects the Germ - Layer Potential of the EpiSC Lines To test the germ - layer potential of the EpiSCs , their immediate response to induction of differentiation was examined by assay - ing the expression of lineage marker genes during a short - term ( 4 day ) culture . Sixteen EpiSC lines ( four CAV , three PS , six LMS , and three LB lines , in triplicate samples ) were studied by qPCR analysis of the expression of markers of pluripotency ( Pou5f1 and Nanog ) , progenitors of endoderm ( Mixl1 , Sox17 , Foxa2 , and Sox7 ) , mesoderm ( T , Meox1 , and Mesp1 ) , and neuro - ectoderm ( Sox1 and Pax6 ) and primordial germ cells ( Prdm1 and Stella ) and two reference genes ( Actb and Tbp ) . At day 0 , the level of expression of the 14 marker genes , normalized against Actb , did not vary signiﬁcantly among the 16 EpiSC lines ( Figure S4 ) . However , upon induction of differen - tiation , EpiSCs displayed different patterns of up - and downre - gulation of the markers ( summarized as heatmaps by fold changes of each gene over the 4 day period , Figure S4 ) , whereas the expression of the housekeeping gene , Tbp , remained con - stant . The general responses were the upregulation of ectoderm ( Sox1 and Pax6 ) and endoderm ( Mixl1 , Sox17 , Sox7 , and Foxa2 ) genes , and the downregulation of pluripotency - related genes . A correlation matrix analysis revealed that the expression patterns of the markers could be categorized into four syn - expression groups ( Figure 6A ) . During EpiSC differentiation , the expression of the PGC marker , Stella , followed that of the pluripotency genes Pou5f1 and Nanog . The other PGC - related gene , Prdm1 , behaved more like deﬁnitive endoderm genes and therefore could be marking endoderm differentiation ( Chang et al . , 2002 ) . Mesoderm precursor genes ( Mesp1 and T ) and the early endoderm and ectoderm lineage markers ( Mixl1 , Sox1 , Foxa2 , and Pax6 ) made up the other two syn - expression clusters . However , hierarchical clustering and correlation matrix analysis of the expression of the marker genes collectively for the syn - expression groups ( Figure 6B ) did not reveal any apparent subgrouping of these EpiSC lines . To assess if subsets of EpiSC lines could be distinguished by the expression of genes in a syn - expression group , we further analyzed the expression pattern of Nanog , Sox1 , Pax6 , T , and Mixl1 by K - Medians clustering of the qPCR data set . EpiSC lines , which displayed similar levels of Nanog expression prior to differ - entiation , can be distinguished by the changes in Nanog expres - sion during differentiation : seven lines showed rapid and robust downregulation ( the ‘‘ Nanog - early’’ group ) ; eight lines showed moderate increase in ﬁrst 2 days and then decreased expression ( the ‘‘ Nanog - late’’ group’’ ) . Based on this classiﬁcation , we rean - alyzed the transcriptome of these EpiSC lines . The ‘‘ Nanog - early’’ group expressed a higher level of neuronal development genes , whereas the ‘‘ Nanog - late’’ group expressed a higher level of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) genes and pluripotency - related genes including Pou5f1 and Klf4 and signaling factors such as Nodal and Inhba , which codes for Activin A ( Figure 6C ; Table S3 ) . The downregulation of Nanog expression therefore reﬂects the ability of EpiSCs to exit from pluripotency to undergo neural differentiation . Next , the predisposition of neural lineage was examined by analyzing Sox1 expression ( Figure 6D ) . The peak expression of Sox1 was observed at day 1 in the ‘‘ Sox1 - early’’ group , days 2 – 3 in the ‘‘ Sox1 - intermediate’’ group , and at day 4 in the ‘‘ Sox1 - late’’ group . The transcriptome of Sox1 - early lines displayed a neural predisposition , whereas that of Sox1 - interme - diate and Sox1 - late lines revealed a mesendoderm predisposi - tion ( Figure 6D ; Table S3 ) . Because the Pax6 response to serum - induced differentiation did not discriminate between EpiSC lines ( Figure S3 ) , we further tested the response of EpiSCs to the withdrawal of the growth factors in a serum - free condition that drives the differentiation of EpiSCs to the anterior neural plate - like state ( Iwafuchi - Doi et al . , 2012 ) . Based on the pattern of Pax6 expression , EpiSC lines could be segregated into the ‘‘ Pax6 - early’’ group showing peak Pax6 expression at day 1 and the ‘‘ Pax6 - late’’ group showing peak expression at day 2 or later ( Figure 6E ; Table S3 ) . The Pax6 - early EpiSC lines ex - pressed higher level of neural lineage genes , whereas Pax6 - late group expressed Hox family genes , suggesting Pax6 - early response may be correlated with the anterior - biased ectoderm characteristics , whereas Pax6 - late responses are associated with the propensity to generate posterior neural progenitors . To assess the potential of mesoderm differentiation , EpiSC lines were grouped by T expression ( Figure 6F ) : the ‘‘ T - strong’’ ( C – F ) EpiSC linesgrouped on temporal gene expressionpattern of ( C ) Nanog , ( D ) Sox1 , ( E ) Pax6 , and ( F ) T by K - Medians clustering and analyzed fordifferentially expressed genes and GO terms .

See also Figures S4 , S5 , and Tables S3 and S4 . expression of genes related to cell adhe - sion and extracellular matrix , whereas T - weak group expressed genes related to primitive streak and anterior mesendo - derm / ectoderm differentiation ( Figure 6F ; Table S3 ) . EpiSCs of the T - weak group therefore show anterior primitive streak - like properties , whereas the T - strong group is predisposed for mesoderm dif - ferentiation . The T - late group showed higher expression of pluripotency - related genes ( Inhba , Inhbb , Klf4 ) and the genes coding extracellular matrix and focal adhesion ( Table S3 ) . In the embryo , Mixl1 expression marks the emergence of the progenitors of mesoderm and endoderm in the primitive streak and loss of Mix1 leads to absence of deﬁnitive endoderm ( Hart et al . , 2002 ) . To evaluate the propensity of endoderm differentiation , EpiSCs were categorized by the timing of upregulation of Mixl1 into ‘‘ Mixl1 - early , ’’ ‘‘ Mixl1 - intermediate , ’’ and ‘‘ Mixl1 - late’’ groups ( Figure 7A ) . The transcriptomes of both the Mixl1 - early and Mixl1 - intermediate EpiSCs showed higher expression of plurip - otency - related genes , but the Mixl1 - early EpiSCs showed higher expression of endoderm - related genes . The Mixl1 - late EpiSCs , Cell Stem Cell EpiSCs Display Anterior Primitive Streak Properties 116 Cell Stem Cell 14 , 107 – 120 , January 2 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . when compared to the other two groups , showed stronger expression of mesenchyme - and neural - related genes ( Fig - ure 7B ; Table S3 ) . All four Mixl1 - early EpiSC lines ( PS4 , LMS2 , PS3 , and PS5 ) displayed the ‘‘ Sox1 - early’’ expression pattern ( Figure 6B ) . The expression of lineage - related genes determined by the microarray analysis was validated by qPCR in 19 EpiSC lines ( Table S4 ) . Of the 43 genes tested , 40 showed signiﬁcant correlation of array and qPCR results ( p < 0 . 0001 ) . In the four Mixl1 - early and ﬁve Mixl1 - late EpiSCs , these lineage - related genes , including six genes that were strongly expressed in the Mixl1 - early group ( Lefty2 , Dnmt3b , L1td1 , Gdf3 , Pou5f1 , and Epha1 ; Figure 7B ) , also showed signiﬁcant correlation between themicroarray and qPCRresults ( Table S4 ) . Priorto in vitrodiffer - entiation , EpiSC colonies of the three Mixl1 groups showed the presence of T - positive cells , but Sox17 + and Foxa2 + cells were not detected , suggesting that these cells had not initiated endo - derm differentiation ( Figures S5A and S5B ) . Fluorescence - acti - vated cell sorting analysis further showed the presence of more PlexinA2 - expressing ( neural - related ) cellsinthe Mixl1 - lateEpiSC colonies ( Figure S5C ) , which is consistent with the higher level of expression of neuroectoderm - related markers ( Figure 7B ) . A comparison of the differentially expressed genes associated with Mixl1 grouping ( Figure 7B ; Table S3 ) of four EpiSC lines by hierarchical clustering analysis revealed a consistency of the gene expression pattern among the parental and its sublines ( Figure S5D ) , which may account for the stability of the differen - tiation propensity of the EpiSC line at different passages . Lineage Differentiation Potential of EpiSCs Grouped by Mixl1 Expression Pattern To test the lineage differentiation potential of EpiSCs of the three Mixl1 groups , we analyzed the tissue composition of teratomas generated from these EpiSCs by qPCR analysis ( Figure 7C ) . The lines from Mixl1 - early group exhibited higher expression of genes associated with the endoderm tissues ( Hnf4 , Ttr , Pyy , and Claudin6 ) and mesoderm tissues ( Myf5 and Wt1 ) but a similar level of gene expression for ectoderm tissues ( Nestin and Tubb3 ) when compared with the Mixl1 - late teratomas . The gene expression proﬁles of Mixl1 - intermediate teratomas were more closely related to the Mixl1 - late group . To test more directly if the Mixl1 expression pattern may be correlated with differences in their endoderm differentiation potential , one EpiSC line each was selected from the Mixl1 - early and the Mixl1 - intermediate group to track their differentiation in serum - containing medium . Neuroectoderm markers Tubb3 and Olig2 were expressed higher in the Mixl1 - intermediate EpiSCs . In contrast , the Mixl1 - early EpiSCs displayed higher expression of genes of mesoderm and endoderm derivatives , such as Flk1 , Pecam1 , Hhex , and Cdx2 ( Figure 7D ) . We further subjected ﬁve different EpiSC lines of the Mixl1 - early , Mixl1 - in - termediate , and Mixl1 - late groups to culture conditions for directed differentiation to the endoderm lineage . After 4 days of culture , the Mixl1 - early EpiSC lines tended to express Sox17 at a higher level than EpiSCs of the other two categories ( Fig - ure S5E ) . Upon further directed differentiation , the Mixl1 - early line ( PS4 ) expressed signiﬁcantly higher expression of genes for foregut ( Sox2 , Pyy , and Hnf1b ) , hindgut ( Cdx2 ) , liver ( Afp , Hhex , and Krt19 ) and pancreas ( Ngn3 ) lineage when compared to Mixl1 - intermediate ( CAV1 ) and Mixl1 - late ( CAV4 ) line ( Fig - ure 7E ) . These results show that early upregulation of Mixl1 during serum - mediated differentiation of the EpiSCs is corre - lated with a predisposition to respond more robustly to the in - duction of differentiation to endoderm lineage by Activin A . DISCUSSION Derivation of epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) is limited to a window of postimplantation development ( CAV : E5 . 5 to LB : E8 . 0 ) that coincides with the progressive decline of the expression of the pluripotency - related genes in the epiblast / ectoderm ( epi / ect ) during gastrulation ( this study ; Osorno et al . , 2012 ) . We showed that the transcriptomes of these EpiSC lines resemble each other regardless of the original developmental stage of the source tissue . Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering of the transcriptomes showed that EpiSCs as a group display a gene expression proﬁle that is most similar to that of the ecto - derm of embryos at late gastrulation . At the late - gastrula stage , the ectoderm is poised for neuroectoderm differentiation . EpiSCs may therefore be at a state of ‘‘primed’’ pluripotency that is distinct from ‘‘naive’’ pluripotency of mESCs ( Nichols and Smith , 2009 ) . The primed pluripotency state of the EpiSCs may also account for their inefﬁciency to participate in chimera formation , and the poor response to induction of primordial germ cells ( Hayashi et al . , 2011 ) . The transcriptome of the EpiSCs differs from that of the epi / ect regarding the activity of genes associated with FGF / MAPK , TGF - b , and WNT signaling . This phenomenon may reﬂect the response and the adaptation of the epi / ect cells to the Activin and FGF supplemented culture conditions . FGF signaling , up - stream of the MAPK pathway , is crucial to restrain the neuronal differentiation of EpiSCs ( Greber et al . , 2010 ) , and to stimulate feeder cells to produce Activin A , the TGF - b signaling ligand sup - porting the self - renewal of EpiSCs ( Greber et al . , 2007 ) . The acti - vation of these signaling pathway genes and the enrichment of primitive streak genes raise the possibility that the EpiSCs may have acquired the properties of primitive streak cells ( Tam and Loebel , 2007 ) . The enrichment of anterior streak genes versus the downregulation of posterior streak genes , and the speciﬁc morphogenetic behavior and pattern of tissue contribution dis - played by EpiSCs following grafting to the primitive streak ( Huang et al . , 2012 and this study ) further highlight that EpiSCs are showing the lineage characteristics of anterior primitive streak cells ( Kinder et al . , 2001 ; Tam and Beddington , 1987 ) . Our differentiation proﬁling of the EpiSC lines has revealed that certain lineage signatures embedded in the transcriptome can be correlated with the predisposition for germ - layer differentia - tion . For example , EpiSCs that robustly and rapidly upregulate Mixl1 when induced to differentiate are enriched for transcripts characteristic of endoderm progenitors and pluripotency and differentiate more efﬁciently into endoderm derivatives in vitro and in vivo as teratomas . We have focused on the EpiSCs of the Mixl1 group and demonstrated that there is a discernible endoderm lineage bias . This inherent propensity for endoderm differentiation is likely to be entrained as it persists even when cells are subject to conditions of directed differentiation to endo - derm . It is presently not known whether the lineage bias of the EpiSC lines is the results of a uniform tendency of all cells to lean toward a speciﬁc path of differentiation or whether there Cell Stem Cell EpiSCs Display Anterior Primitive Streak Properties Cell Stem Cell 14 , 107 – 120 , January 2 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 117 are differences in the composition of the stem cell colonies . Our results so far have shown that the apparent endoderm bias of the Mixl1 - early EpiSC lines could be due to the preponderance of cells that are primed for endoderm differentiation , which can respond more effectively to induction by the TGF - b signals . Consistent with the concept of heterogeneity of cell types , EpiSCs of the Mixl1 - early group also display Sox1 - early pheno - type , suggesting that the endoderm - biased population may coexist with neural - biased cells . In contrast to the Mixl1 - early lines , the Mixl1 - late lines show an overall enhanced expression of the neural lineage genes and contain a larger fraction of neural progenitor - like cells . Although we have not tested the lineage bias of cell lines grouped by other gene expression patterns , it is possible that they may also display some bias in lineage poten - tial . A caveat of the population - based transcriptome and differ - entiation analysis in the present study is that it only provides an average of the cellular properties that would mask the inherent variations among cells . In this regard , future work should be directed to single - cell analysis of the transcriptome and using sorted cell population of common characteristics for assessing the innate lineage potency of the stem cells . Induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) generated from different types of somatic cells using different reprogramming approaches may have different lineage potential . This phenomenon may be asso - ciated with the memory and de novo creation of epigenetic marks in the genome during cellular reprogramming ( Kim et al . , 2011 ; Polo et al . , 2010 ; Bar - Nur et al . , 2011 ; Liang and Zhang , 2013 ) . It is therefore likely the predisposition of lineage potential in the EpiSCs may also involve modiﬁcations of the epigenome . The categorization of the lineage potency of multipotent stem cells could be applied to the choice of cell lines for directed differentiation of the desirable lineage . Our ﬁndings open an experimental avenue to characterize the potential of lineage differentiation of stem cells derived from other embryonic tissues or by reprogramming of somatic cells . It would be feasible to evaluate the cells by the speciﬁc gene expression signature in conjunction with the response to the induction of differentiation . In view of the observation that EpiSCs are dependent on signaling activity similar to that for the maintenance of human ESCs ( Vallier et al . , 2009b , 2009c ; Kim et al . , 2013 ) , the knowl - edge gleaned from EpiSCs may be applicable for predicting the lineage potential of human pluripotent stem cells . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Generation of EpiSCs E5 . 5 – E8 . 5 129 strain embryos were staged ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures : Staging of Embryos ) and used for generating EpiSC lines and sampling tissues for transcriptome analysis . Whole epiblast of pregastrulation embryos and the epiblast / ectoderm ( epi / ect , excluding the primitive streak ) of gastrula - stage embryos were dissected ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures : Dissection and Culture of Epiblast and Ectoderm ) . The explants were cultured on mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts in EpiSC culture medium ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures : Culture Media and Preparation of MEFs ) . Additional EpiSC lines were also generated for characterization of the molecular properties and differentiation potential : six from 129 embryos ( stages : two CAV , one PS , one LMS , and two LB ) , two from 129SvJ embryo harboring the CMV - RFP transgene ( one each of CAV and PS stage ; Vintersten et al . , 2004 ) , and three CAV stage from ICR ; C57BL / 6 embryos expressing the Kikume Green - Red ( KikGR ) transgene ( Ando et al . , 2002 ) . Eleven EpiSC lines were cultured for seven to ten passages , 14 lines between ten and 20 passages , and 15 lines for more than 20 passages . The use of animals for this project has been approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Chil - dren’s Medical Research Institute and the Children Hospital at Westmead . Characterization of EpiSCs For analysis of the expression of pluripotency factors , immunocytochemistry and qPCR were performed . Karyotypes were determined on metaphases prepared from the EpiSCs . Telomere length and telomere trimming were assessedbytheterminalrestrictionfragments assays , and telomerase activity was examined by PCR ampliﬁed telomere extension assay . The differentiation potential of EpiSCs was examined by assessing the tissue composition of teratomas derived from the EpiSCs by histology and histochemistry ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures : Immunocytochemistry , Karyotyping , Telomere Analysis , and Teratoma Analysis and qPCR Analysis ) . RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro and Mini Kits for cultured cell and Lipid Kits for teratoma samples ( QIAGEN ) and used for qPCR analysis of tissue - speciﬁc markers ( see SupplementalExperimental Procedures : qPCR Analysis of Gene Expression ) .

EpiSC colonies in cultures were washed once with PBS followed by PBS containing 2 m M CM - DiI ( in alcoholic solution , Molecular Probes , C7000 ) . Cells were incubated at 37 (cid:3) C for 5 min followed by 10 min on ice . After one wash with PBS , EpiSC colonies were treated with collagenase and cell clumps were collected for transplantation to host embryos . The grafted embryos were cultured in heat - inactivated rat serum for 24 hr in 5 % carbon dioxide , 5 % oxygen , 90 % nitrogen at 37 (cid:3) C ( Rivera - Pe´rez et al . , 2010 ) in a rolling culture chamber . After 24 hr of in vitro development , the patterns of tissue contribution by the descendants of EpiSCs ( labeled with CM - DiI dye or expressing red ﬂuorescent protein [ RFP ] ) were visualized in whole embryos by ﬂuorescence microscopy . The embryos were ﬁxed in 4 % PFA for 30 min , the yolk sac and amnion were dissected away , and then the embryos wereembedded inOCTcompound and cryosectioned . Forimmuno - ﬂuorescence imaging of cryosections counterstained with DAPI , the same an - tibodies as for immunocytochemistry were used . Testing Lineage Potential of EpiSCS by In Vitro Differentiation EpiSCs were tested for in vitro differentiation to endoderm derivatives ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures : Generating Embryoid Body from EpiSCs and In Vitro Differentiation of EpiSCs : Serum - Induced Differentiation ) . For short - term differentiation , day 0 RNA samples were processed also for microarray , and samples of embryoid bodies were collected daily for 4 days Statistical analysis of the qPCR data and the generation of correlation matrix and the heatmaps were done in R ( see Figure 6 legend for packages used ) . The cellular composition of the EpiSC colonies was analyzed by immunocyto - chemistry and ﬂow cytometry ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures : Immunocytochemistry and Flow Cytometry Analysis ) . For long - term differ - entiation , embryoid bodies after 4 day culture were plated down on a gelatin - coated plate . Samples were collected on days 0 , 4 , 7 , and 14 . For directed differentiation , EpiSC colonies were dissociated into single cells , Cell Stem Cell EpiSCs Display Anterior Primitive Streak Properties 118 Cell Stem Cell 14 , 107 – 120 , January 2 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . and approximately 500 cells were placed in each microwell on the Aggre - Well400 plate ( STEMCELL Technologies ) to generate embryoid bodies , which were then cultured with a modiﬁed protocol for directed differentiation to endodermcells ( seeSupplementalExperimentalProcedures : InVitroDifferen - tiationofEpiSCs : DirectedDifferentiation ) . Sampleswerecollectedonﬁfthand tenth days of in vitro culture . qPCR of RNAs extracted from the cultures was performed using customized RT2 Proﬁler PCR Array ( QIAGEN ) .
