ABSTRACT Introduction : The existence of receptor - mediated endocytosis ( RME ) means that selectivity and selectivity occurs in capturing macromolecules . Protein kinase C ( PKC ) which can be expressed by almost all cells are proteins important in signal transduction groove that plays a role in a number of cell activity , e . g . phagocytosis . Aims : The purpose of this study is to determine the expression of RME after modulating the PKC which is characterized by the number of Can - dida albicans cells attached to the surface of macrophages . Methods : Peritoneal macrophages cultured BALB / c mice are treated with PMA and / or bisindolylmaleimides of providing levels of 5 ng / ml to 100 ng / ml for 10 minutes . Then immediately insert Candida albicans and observe every 30 minutes for 120 minutes . The research design used the same subject . Data collected in the form of number of Candida albicans cells attached to the surface of macrophages are analyzed with ANOVA statistical test ( one way ) to show the differences between treatments . Results : The test shows statistically significant difference in the number of Candida albicans cells attached to the surface of macrophages after administration of various levels of PMA ( p < 0 . 001 ) . The higher level of PMA is given , the more active the PKC is , the more RME are formed , the more Candida albicans cells attached to the surface of macrophages . Another result shows statistically significant difference in the number of Candida albicans cells attached to the surface of macrophages after administration of various levels of bisindolylmaleimides ( p < 0 . 001 ) . The higher level of bisindolylmaleimide is given , the less active PKC is , and the less RME are formed , the less Candida albicans cells attached to the surface of macro - phages . Conclusion : Research shows that activator PKC ( PMA ) can increase the expression of RME on macrophages . Another research shows that inhibitor PKC ( bisindolylmaleimides ) can decrease the expression of RME on macrophages . Keywords : PMA ; Bisindolylmaleimides ; RME ; PKC ; Phagocytosis 1 . Introduction Phorbol esters are polycyclic alcohol that is derived from croton oil . Phorbol ester is highly carcinogenic and known as tumor promoters [ 1 - 3 ] . How phorbol ester activates PKC is identical to how diacylglycerol ( DAG ) activates PKC . Phorbol ester activation is persistent , because it is very similar to the DAG and not immediately degraded [ 2 , 3 ] . Bisindolylmaleimides is a potent and selective in - hibitor of Protein kinase C which provides evidence for the potential use of PKC inhibitor as therapeutic immu - nomodulators [ 4 ] . Protein kinase C ( PKC ) family is a he - terogeneous family of phospholipid - dependent kinases [ 5 ] . Protein kinase C has a number of important roles in cellular growth and differentiation , cellular metabolism , and transcriptional activation , most of which are not well understood [ 2 , 3 , 6 - 8 ] . Protein kinase C as allosteric en - zyme can be modulated so it can make a pharmacological target [ 4 , 9 , 10 ] . * Corresponding author . Copyright © 2013 SciRes . JIBTVA A . PRAYITNO ET AL . 45 Candida albicans is the most common organism to be associated with superficial candidosis . Oral colonization may originate early in infancy , although its incidence is increased by a number of factors , including hospitaliza - tion and bottle feeding . Some factors are systemic , and others are related to local conditions [ 11 ] . Little is known about the precise mechanisms involved in immunity to fungal infection . Macrophages and T cells immunity may be implicated in resistance to fungal infection [ 5 , 12 - 14 ] . The role of PKC , expression of receptor mediated en - docytosis and phagocytosis toward Candida albicans may be explained by pathobiology examination [ 15 , 16 ] . This concept gives a chance to explain how to modulate immune response toward Candida albicans . The existence of receptor - mediated endocytosis ( RME ) means for selectivity and effectiveness of arresting mac - romolecules that may be in very low concentrations in the extracellular fluid , e . g . controlled by a cell receptor to capture various types of substrates , including hormones , growth factors , enzymes - enzymes , and plasma proteins [ 2 , 17 , 18 ] . Then that macromolecules outside the cell have been collected and attached to the cell surface or plasma membrane into the cell to form a basin which means that RME has become the receptor binding in the area at the plasma membrane , known as coated pits [ 2 , 19 ] . Some re - ceptors are concentrated in coated pits for a long time with a fixed concentration in the plasma membrane [ 2 , 20 - 22 ] . 2 . Method Macrophages obtained from the peritoneal cavity of mice BALB / c done in a way as is done by Colligan , et al . with some modifications [ 23 ] . Macrophages obtained by using a 10 ml syringe and hypodermic needle 25 G . The results collected in sizes 25 ml centrifuge tube and stored on ice . Macrophage cultures performed in culture dishes with a diameter of 20 mm . Macrophages were distributed into each well of the plate so that the culture wells containing an average of 1000 cells . For ease of painting it on the basis of prior pitting the cover glass is placed before the cell is inserted . Further culture medium Roswell Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI ) 1640 ( Sigma Chem . Co . . St . Louis , USA ) inserted into the wells as much as 10 ml . Medium replacement done once every 24 hours and in - cubated at room temperature . Before treated culture medium were taken and cultured cells were washed with PBS - 10F ( PD : 137 nM - NaCl - KCl 3 nM , 7 nM - Phosphate Buffer , pH 7 . 4 ) and subse - quently given the PMA ( Sigma Chem . Co . . , St . Louis , USA ) for 10 minutes in the levels of 5 ng / ml to 100 ng / ml at room temperature . After the AMF in the exhaust and cleaned with PBS - 10F , added C . albicans approxi - mately 200 cells per well and were observed every 30 min for 120 minutes [ 24 , 25 ] . After the observation period finish the glass cover at the base of the existing wells cell culture was taken and carried the painting with Giemsa ( MERCK ) . Nikkon microscope equipped with a photo tool used to document the results with 100 multiple magnification , every 30 mi - nutes for 120 minutes [ 2 ] . 3 . Result The number of Candida albicans cells attached to the surface of macrophages can be seen in Figure 1 below , The test shows statistically significant difference in the number of Candida albicans cells attached to the surface of macrophages after administration of various levels of PMA ( p < 0 . 001 ) . The higher level of PMA is given , the more active PKC , the more RME are formed , the more Candida albicans cells attached to the surface of macro - phages ( Table 1 ) . Another result showed statistically significant differ - ence in the number of Candida albicans cells attached to the surface of macrophages after administration of vari - ous levels of bisindolylmaleimides ( p < 0 . 001 ) . The high - er level of bisindolylmaleimide is given , the less active PKC , the less RME are formed , less Candida albicans cells attached to the surface of macrophages ( Table 2 ) . 4 . Discussion Phorbol Ester said can activate PKC . Polyciclic alcohol that derivate from croton oil is very carcinogenic , so it known as tumor promoter . Phorbol ester activate PKC because they similarity with diacylglycerol . The activity is persistent , because phorbol ester is similar with dia - cylglycerol which can’t quickly degradated . If PKCs are going active can increases the signal transduction activity for cells activity . Phorbol ester also can increase the macropinicytosis toward Lucifer Yellow [ 3 , 26 , 27 ] . Dia - cylglycerol had two important signal pathways . First , they are break further for release the arachidonic acid , its ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Figure 1 .

Second , it more important , they can ac - tivate kinase serine / threonine protein kinase which selec - tively to phosphorelate in target cells . The effect of dia - cylglycerol can change with phorbol ester , that in plant production in the dependency with kinase C . The activity is direct . This reagents seen that this pathway always im - ages the cellular response . More type cells can stimu - late the proliferation of cells culture if administrated with kinase C activator [ 7 , 28 ] . Inhibitors of PKC could interact with the substrate - binding site or with regulatory site of PKC . The struc - tural similarity between bisindolylmaleimides , chelery - thine and staurospoorine suggested that bisindolylmalei - mides may be a competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP . The inhibition of PKC by bisindolylmaleimides was demonstrated to be highly dependent on the ATP concentration [ 4 , 29 ] . GF 109203X inhibited collagen - and alpha - thrombin - induced platelet aggregation as well as collagen - triggered ATP secretion . However , ADP - dependent reversible aggregation was not modified . In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts , GF 109203X reversed the inhibi - tion of epidermal growth factor binding induced by phor - bol 12 , 13 - dibutyrate and prevented [ 3H ] thymidine in - corporation into DNA , only when this was elicited by growth promoting agents which activate PKC [ 4 ] . Cell signalling includes : 1 ) Recognation of the stimu - lus by a specific receptor embedded wthin the membrane . 2 ) Transfer of a signal to its cytoplasmic surface . 3 ) Transmission of the signal to specific receptor molecules within the cytoplasm that trigger the cell’s response 4 ) Cessation of the response as a result of the destruction or inactivation of the signaling molecule . Evidence from re - cent studies indicates are complex , for examples : 1 ) Sig - nal from variety of unrelated growth factors , each bind - ing to its own receptor , can convergence to activate a common effector . 2 ) Signal from same ligand , can diver - ge to activate a variety of different effectors , leading to cellular response . 3 ) Signal can be passed back and forth between different pathways , a phenomenon known as crosstalk [ 3 , 30 ] . Some cells have a mechanism for internalism material needs from the environment outside the cell to inside the cytoplasmic through bubble dent derived from the plas - ma membrane . With the RME then macromolecules bind to specific RME projected on the outer surface of the plasma membrane [ Stites and Terr , 1991 ] . Pinocytosis and macropinocytosis associated with the influx of fluids and soluble molecules into cells are characterized by in - creased metabolic activity of the cells . Phagocytosis pro - cess includes chemotaxis , catch - consuming macromole - cules ( by forming phagosome ) , digest ( by forming secon - dary lysosomes and ongoing enzymatic degradation ) and release it back that has been in the form of small particles particle non - antigenic [ 5 , 31 ] . PKC has the amino - therminal regulatory domain ( 20 - 70 kDa ) which is the binding site for phorbol ester . This domain is divided into carboxyl - terminal catalytic do - main ( approximately 45 kDa ) consisting of a binder Adenosine Tri Phosphate ( ATP ) and substrate binding site where the two are connected by a flexible hinge re - gion [ 32 , 33 ] . PKC conventional dependent calcium and Copyright © 2013 SciRes . JIBTVA A . PRAYITNO ET AL . 47 DAG or phorbol ester as a cofactor , while PKC Novel depends only on DAG or phorbol ester . Atypical PKC is not dependent calcium nor DAG for maximal activity [ 3 ] . PKC can modulate for anti inflammatory [ 34 - 36 ] , diabe - tes complication [ 37 , 38 ] , regulating of actin cytoskeleton [ 39 ] , and apoptosis [ 40 ] . 5 . Conclusion Research shows that activator PKC ( PMA ) can increase the expression of RME on macrophages . Another re - search shows that inhibitor PKC ( bisindolylmaleimides ) can decrease the expression of RME on macrophages . 6 .
