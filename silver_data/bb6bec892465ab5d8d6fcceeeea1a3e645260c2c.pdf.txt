Cell , Vol . 108 , 109 – 120 , January 11 , 2002 , Copyright  2002 by Cell Press The Nucleoporin RanBP2 Has SUMO1 E3 Ligase Activity ( Aos1 / Uba2 ) and a single E2 conjugating enzyme ( Ubc9 ) have been identified in yeast and higher eukaryotes . In vitro , these are sufficient to modify a number of SUMO1 Andrea Pichler , 1 , 4 Andreas Gast , 1 , 4 Jacob S .

However , recently several SUMO Germany E3 - like factors were identified in yeast and mammalian 2 Unite´ de Recombinaison et Expression Ge´ne´tique cells ( Johnson and Gupta , 2001 ; Kahyo et al . , 2001 ; INSERM U163 Sachdev et al . , 2001 ; Takahashi et al . , 2001 ) .

Based on immunofluorescence studies , both subunits Summary of the SUMO1 E1 activating enzyme reside predomi - nantly in the nucleus ( Azuma et al . , 2001 ; Rodriguez et Posttranslational modification with SUMO1 regulates al . , 2001 ) .

This raises the question of why other targets need SUMO1 ( small ubiquitin - related modifier , also known as an NLS for steady - state modification in vivo . We could Pic1 , Ubl1 , hSmt3 , or sentrin ) is only 18 % identical to envisage three equally likely possibilities . First , SUMO1 ubiquitin but resembles its structure , its ability to be modification of some targets may be restricted to the reversibly ligated to other proteins , and its mechanism nuclear compartment due to the localization of their of ligation . More than 30 proteins from different species specific E3 ligases . Second , SUMO1 modification of have been identified as SUMOylation substrates , and other targets may take place in the cytoplasm , but they available data provide compelling evidence for a role of need to enter the nucleus in order to be protected from SUMO1 in the regulation of protein - protein interactions , isopeptidases . Third , SUMO1 modification may depend subcellular localization , and stability ( reviewed by Hay , on components of the nuclear import machinery . 2001 ; Melchior , 2000 ; Mu¨ller et al . , 2001 ) . Like ubiquitin , Experiments aimed at understanding SUMO1’s intra - SUMO1 is attached to targets via an isopeptide bond nuclear localization led us to the discovery that RanBP2 betweentheCterminusofSUMO1andthe (cid:3) aminogroup has an E3 - like activity in the modification of proteins of target lysine residues . Ubiquitination of a specific with SUMO1 . As RanBP2 is part of the cytoplasmic fila - target requires three enzymes : an E1 activating enzyme , ments of the NPC and serves as a docking site for import an E2 conjugating enzyme , and an E3 ligating enzyme complexes ( Ben - Efraim and Gerace , 2001 ; Wu et al . , ( Hershko and Ciechanover , 1998 ) . Only a single ubiquitin 1995 ; Yaseen and Blobel , 1999 ; Yokoyama et al . , 1995 ) , E1 has been identified , but multiple E2 and E3 enzymes this suggests that NLS - containing targets for SUMO1 are known . E3 ligases confer substrate specificity and modification can be modified en route to the nucleus . are highly regulated to ensure that target degradation occurs onlyat theappropriate time ( reviewed inJackson Results et al . , 2000 ; Joazeiro and Weissman , 2000 ) .

Owing to the nate between active import of free or conjugated small size of SUMO1 ( 10 kDa ) , this could occur by active SUMO1 .

Instead , it acccumulated at proteins are too large to enter by diffusion . To test this , the nuclear envelope in a pattern reminiscent of NPC we used three experimental approaches : first , transfec - staining .

This would , however , require to exist in the nucleus ( Hay , 2001 ; Melchior , 2000 ; Mu¨ller the presence of SUMO E1 and E2 enzymes in cytosol et al . , 2001 ) . An alternative explanation , noncovalent or at the NPC . Indeed , HeLa cytosol contains significant nuclear retention requiring the Gly Gly motif in SUMO1 , amounts of Aos1 and Ubc9 ( see Supplementary Figure was ruled out by microinjection experiments . For these , S4 at http : / / www . cell . com / cgi / content / full / 108 / 1 / 109 / we microinjected YFP - SUMO1 ( 1 – 97 ) into HeLa cells DC1 ) . Therefore , we replaced the cytosol in the assay and followed its localization over time ( Figure 1C and with recombinant Aos1 / Uba2 and Ubc9 .

Passive Diffusion , Conjugation , and Active Transport Contribute to SUMO1 Intranuclear Accumulation ( A ) The C terminus of SUMO1 is necessary for its accummulation in the nucleoplasm and in nuclear speckles . Adherent HeLa cells were transfected with pEYFP , pEYFP - SUMO1 ( 1 – 97 ) , or pEYFP - SUMO1 ( 1 – 95 ) and fixed after 20 hr with 2 % formaldehyde . YFP and YFP - fusion proteins were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy .

( C ) Energy depletion inhibits nuclear accumulation of YFP - SUMO1 . YFP - SUMO1 ( 1 – 97 ) ( 0 . 4 mg / ml ) was microinjected into HeLa cells with or without prior depletion of ATP . Pictures were taken at indicated time points ( injections were all done within times 0 min and 1 min ) . Arrowheads mark nuclear injection . also rapidly and quantitatively modified by recombinant multiple sites . At 30 min , a faint higher molecular weight smear was apparent , perhaps indicative of additional Aos1 / Uba2 and Ubc9 ( see Okuma et al . , 1999 , and be - low ) . To test whether RanBP2 can also be modified by conjugates . To investigate this further , we repeated the time course with an excess of enzymes and SUMO1 Aos1 / Uba2 and Ubc9 alone , we generated two frag - ments of RanBP2 ( depicted in Figure 3A ) that were re - ( Figure 3C ) . Under these conditions , RanGAP1 was again rapidly modified to a single species . In contrast , ported to contain the necessary determinants for SUMO1 modification as well as interactions with Gst - BP2 gave rise to multiple bands that increased in molecular weight during the time course . We infer from SUMO1 * RanGAP1 and Ubc9 ( Matunis et al . , 1998 ; Sai - toh et al . , 1998 ) . During the course of this study , we the molar ratios used in this reaction that each Gst - BP2 is modified by up to 25 molecules of SUMO1 . As shown found that the smaller fragment ( BP2 (cid:4) FG ) is sufficient for the properties described below . Figure 3B shows a in Figure 3D , the extent to which RanBP2 is modified depends on the molar ratio of Gst - BP2 and SUMO1 .

Covalent Modification at the NPC ( A ) In vitro nuclear import assays with digitonin - permeabilized HeLa cells , cytosol , and 0 . 8 (cid:5) g YFP - SUMO1 ( 1 – 97 ) were carried out in the presence ( standard ) or absence of ATP ( addition of 16 U Hexokinase / 5 mM glucose ) . After 30 min at 30 (cid:6) C , cells were washed and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy . Identical exposure times were used for “ (cid:7) ATP” and “standard” samples . Bottom : equatorial view ( left ) and surface view ( right ) of identical standard cells . ( B ) In vitro reactions as in ( A ) but analyzed by flow cytometry .

Gray and white bars indicate duplicate reactions . ( C ) Reactions as in ( A ) but analyzed by immunoblotting . After the reaction , cells were washed twice and lysed in SDS - loading buffer . Samples were resolved on a 5 % – 20 % SDS gel and analyzed by immunoblotting with (cid:2) GFP antibodies . ( D ) Standard reaction and analysis as in ( A ) , but after washing the sample was split in half and incubated for 20 min at 37 (cid:6) C with or without recombinant isopeptidase ( Gst - Ulp1 ) .

The high - molecular - weight RanBP2 - SUMO1 SUMO1 species would be generated by Ulp1 . In the secondscenario ( SUMO1chains onGst - BP2 ) , thecleav - conjugates could potentially form by attachment of sin - gle SUMO1 entities to multiple lysines in Gst - BP2 or age intermediates could also consist of SUMO1 oligo - mers . As is apparent from the cleavage pattern , recom - could reflect the formation of SUMO1 chains via SUMO1 - SUMO1 isopeptide bond formation . To distin - binant Ulp1 rapidly generates species with apparent mobilities of (cid:1) 30 , (cid:1) 45 , and (cid:1) 60 kDa , indicative of guish between these two possibilities , we added the S . cerevisiae isopeptidase Ulp1 to hypermodified Gst - SUMO1 dimers , trimers , and tetramers , and the high - molecular - weight species disappear . This result is most BP2 ( Figure3E ) .

Hypermodification and SUMO1 Chain Formation on RanBP2 ( A ) Schematic diagram of RanBP2 and constructs used in this study . The 358 kDa RanBP2 contains a leucine - rich domain , a zinc finger domain , four RanGTP binding domains ( R1 – R4 ) , a cyclophilin domain ( CY ) , and several FG and FXFG repeats ( indicated by short and long dashes , respectively ) . I 1 and I 2 indicate the presence of an internal repeat motif ( Wu et al . , 1995 ; Yokoyama et al . , 1995 ) . ( B ) RanGAP1 and RanBP2 are both efficiently modified with recombinant E1 and E2 enzymes . Recombinant RanGAP1 and BP2 (cid:4) FG ( 500 ng each ) were incubated with SUMO1 ( 1 . 5 (cid:5) g ) , E1 ( 150 ng ) , E2 ( 10 ng ) , and 5 mM ATP at 37 (cid:6) C . Reactions were stopped at indicated time points with Laemmli - buffer . Proteins were separated on 5 % – 20 % SDS - PAGE , and proteins were stained with Coomassie blue . ( C ) Hypermodification of RanBP2 . In vitro SUMOylation as in ( B ) , using less substrate ( 5 ng Gst - BP2 or RanGAP1 , 15 ng SUMO1 , 150 ng E1 , 10 ng E2 , and 5 mM ATP ) and shorter time points . Detection was by immunoblotting with (cid:2) SUMO1 antibodies . The arrow indicates SUMO1 - modified RanGAP1 , and the asterisk indicates SUMO1 - modified Uba2 ( T . Bu¨sgen , A . P . , and F .

( D ) Increasing amounts of Gst - BP2 ( 5 – 150 ng ) were added to an otherwise constant modification mix ( 15 ng SUMO1 , 150 ng E1 , 10 ng E2 , and 5 mM ATP ) and incubated for 2 . 5 min at 37 (cid:6) C . Detection was by immunoblotting with (cid:2) SUMO1 antibodies . ( E ) Hypermodification of RanBP2 is due to SUMO1 chain formation . Gst - BP2 ( 5 ng ) was hypermodified with 60 ng SUMO1 , 150 ng E1 , 10 ng E2 , and 0 . 5 mM ATP for 5 min at 37 (cid:6) C . To stop the reaction , ATP was depleted with 1 U apyrase . Gst - Ulp1 isopeptidase was added and incubated for indicated time points . Reactions were separated by 5 % – 20 % SDS - PAGE , and detection was performed using (cid:2) SUMO1 antibodies . chains on RanBP2 . SUMO2 is known to form chains E3 - like activity . To address this , we relied on our observa - tion that addition of SUMO1 stimulates modification of involving lysine 11 ( Tatham et al . , 2001 ) . However , the SUMO1 chains on RanBP2 seem to be quite different , endogenous proteins in HeLa cytosol . RanGAP1 and RanBP2 are both present in HeLa cytosol ; RanGAP1 since a mutant lacking amino acids 1 – 20 is still compe - tent for chain formation ( M . Schergaut , A . P . , and F .

(cid:2) RanGAP1 Antibodies Deplete a Stimulatory Activity for SUMOylation from HeLa Cytosol ( A ) HeLa cytosol was incubated with (cid:2) RanGAP1 antibodies or goat preimmunserum ( IgG ) crosslinked to protein G beads . Supernatants ( 30 (cid:5) l ) were tested for SUMOylation activity by incubation with 60 ng SUMO1 and 5 mM ATP ( lanes 1 – 4 ) . Samples were taken at time 0 and after 1 hr at 30 (cid:6) C . Lanes 5 – 8 : (cid:2) RanGAP1 - depleted SN was reconstituted by adding back (cid:2) RanGAP1 beads ( 5 – 6 ) or IgG beads ( 7 – 8 ) prior to the reaction . Reactions were resolved on 5 % – 20 % SDS - PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with (cid:2) SUMO1 ( top ) and (cid:2) RanGAP1 antibodies ( bottom ) . ( B ) RanGAP1 - depleted cytosol is also devoid of RanBP2 . Beads and supernatants of the immunoprecipitation in ( A ) were analyzed by immunoblotting with (cid:2) RanBP2 , (cid:2) Aos1 , (cid:2) Ubc9 , and (cid:2) RanGAP1 antibodies . ( C ) Reactions were performed as in ( A ) . Cytosol depleted with (cid:2) RanGAP1 antibodies was complemented with 5 ng recombinant RanGAP1 ( lanes 5 – 6 ) or 5 ng BP2 (cid:4) FG ( lanes 7 – 8 ) . fication pattern compared to control cytosol ( Figure 4A , contrast to RanGAP1 , addition of 5 ng BP2 (cid:4) FG dramati - cally stimulated the appearance of SUMO1 - modified lanes 2 and 4 ) . To verify that this reduction in activity was caused by depletion rather than inactivation of fac - bands ( Figure 4C , lanes 7 and 8 ) . However , the SUMO1 pattern induced by BP2 (cid:4) FG is more intense than , and tors , we added back IP beads to RanGAP1 - depleted cytosol .

This suggested that SUMO1 modification , we wanted to test its activity with a well - characterized SUMO1 target . For this we chose RanGAP1 , RanBP2 , or an unknown associated factor could be the stimulatory activity that was depleted by Sp100 , a component of PML nuclear bodies ( Sternsdorf et al . , 1999 ) . This protein seemed an ideal candidate for the IP . We explored this possibility by adding 5 ng RanGAP1 or BP2 (cid:4) FG to our depleted cytosol ( Figure RanBP2 - stimulated SUMOylation . It contains a classical NLS , suggesting that it encounters RanBP2 on its way 4C ) . RanGAP1 was quantitatively modified by the de - pleted extract ( Figure 4C , bottom , lanes 5 and 6 ) , con - into the nucleus . Importantly , this NLS is essential for modification of Sp100 at lysine 297 in vivo ( Sternsdorf firming that E1 and E2 enzymes were still active in the extracts .

We set up an in vitro modification assay for Sp100 with recombinant E1 and E2 and tested the dogenous proteins , indicating that RanGAP1 is not the stimulatory activity ( Figure 4C , top , lanes 5 and 6 ) .

RanBP2 Stimulates In Vitro Modification of the SUMO1 Target Sp100 But Not p53 ( A ) Both BP2 (cid:4) FG and full - length HeLa RanBP2 stimulate SUMOylation of Sp100 . In vitro reactions containing 25 ng Gst - Sp100 (cid:4) N , 150 ng E1 , 10 ng E2 , 60 ng SUMO1 , and 5 mM ATP in 20 (cid:5) l reaction volumes were incubated for 1 hr at 30 (cid:6) C in the absence or presence of 5 ng BP2 (cid:4) FG or the RanBP2 - containing (cid:2) RanGAP1 immunoprecipitate described in Figure 4B . Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with (cid:2) Gst antibodies . The appearance of two novel bands ( arrows ) indicate the presence of a major and minor SUMO1 acceptor site in Sp100 . ( B ) Left : In vitro reactions as in ( A ) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of BP2 (cid:4) FG . Right : Reactions with 1 . 5 (cid:5) g Sp100 (cid:4) N , 1 . 5 (cid:5) g SUMO1 , 10 ng E2 , 150 ng E1 , with or without 5 ng BP2 (cid:4) FG . ( C ) RanBP2 stimulates modification of Sp100 at the physiological SUMO1 acceptor site . Gst - Sp100 (cid:4) N ( 25 ng ) or Gst - Sp100 (cid:4) N K297R were incubated with 600 ng SUMO1 , 10 ng E2 , 150 ng E1 , and 5 mM ATP for 7 min at 30 (cid:6) C . Residual modification of the mutant is due to the presence of a second modification site ( see [ A ] and [ B ] ) . ( D ) RanBP2 enhances in vitro SUMOylation of Sp100 but not of p53 . Reactions with 1 (cid:5) g Gst - Sp100 (cid:4) N or Gst - p53 , 1 . 5 (cid:5) g SUMO1 , 10 ng E2 , 150 ng E1 , with or without 5 ng BP2 (cid:4) FG . ( provided in the form of (cid:2) RanGAP1 immunoprecipitates shown in Figure 5D , under conditions that allow efficient modification of Sp100 , p53 is not SUMOylated either in described in Figure 4 ) . As expected , Aos1 / Uba2 and Ubc9 modify only marginal amounts of Sp100 ( Figure the absence or presence of BP2 (cid:4) FG . Our recombinant p53 is competent for modification , as PIASy stimulates 5A ) . This can be significantly increased by the addition of either BP2 (cid:4) FG or full - length RanBP2 , demonstrating p53 SUMOylation in similar experiments ( A . P . , S . Sach - dev , R . Grossschedl , and F . M . , unpublished data ) . We that RanBP2 indeed acts as a stimulator of modification . We then compared increasing amounts of BP2 (cid:4) FG for also tested four novel SUMO1 target proteins ; two of these were better modified in the presence of BP2 (cid:4) FG , their effect on Sp100 modification ( Figure 5B , left ) . Al - ready sufficient for strong stimulation was 1 . 5 nM and two were not affected ( unpublished data ) . In sum - mary , RanBP2 appears to work on several but not all BP2 (cid:4) FG ( 1 ng BP2 (cid:4) FG per 20 (cid:5) l reaction ) . Surprisingly , increasing the concentration of BP2 (cid:4) FG actually de - SUMO1 targets .

One possi - ble explanation for this inverse dose dependence is that excess BP2 (cid:4) FG competes with Sp100 for SUMO1 . This RanBP2 Stimulates Transfer of SUMO1 between Ubc9 and Sp100 was confirmed in the next experiment ( Figure 5B , right ) , where we repeated the experiment with a large excess The substrate specificity of RanBP2 already suggests that it participates in the transfer of SUMO1 from the ofSp100andSUMO1 ( 1 . 5 (cid:5) geachofSp100andSUMO1 , 5ngBP2 (cid:4) FG , 10ngUbc9 , and150ngAos1 / Uba2 ) . Inthe E2 enzyme to its target . However , from our in vitro data , we could not exclude the possibility that it functions presence of BP2 (cid:4) FG , Sp100 was nearly quantitatively modified . RanBP2 stimulates Sp100 modification at its predominantly by enhancing SUMO1 transfer efficiency between the E1 and the E2 enzyme . We investigated physiological SUMO1 attachment site Lys 297 ( Sternsdorf et al . , 1999 ) , as is shown in Figure 5C . A faint band visible the step at which it contributes by comparing rates of Ubc9 - SUMO1 thioester bond formation in the absence in the K297R mutant migrates with different mobility than wt SUMO1 * Sp100 and reflects a second , less efficient , or presence of BP2 (cid:4) FG ( Figure 6A ) . SUMO1 - Ubc9 thio - esters are formed rapidly and efficiently with or without modification site . A hallmark for E3 ligases is that they confer substrate specificity . We thereforetested theability BP2 (cid:4) FG . We reproducibly found a modest stimulation of thioester formation with BP2 (cid:4) FG , but the reason for of RanBP2 to stimulate SUMOylation of another well - known SUMO1 target , the tumor suppressor p53 .

E2 ( 100 ng ) , 150 ng E1 , 100 ng SUMO1 , and 5 mM ATP were incubated with or without 1 ng BP2 (cid:4) FG at 30 (cid:6) C . Reaction was stopped at indicated time points with a nonreducing buffer ( (cid:7) DTT ) or with a reducing buffer ( (cid:8) DTT ) .

After depletion of ATP with 1 U apyrase , 200 ng Gst - Sp100 (cid:4) N and 1 ng BP2 (cid:4) FG , when indicated , were added .

( C ) A double cysteine mutant of Gst - BP2 is still active in Gst - Sp100 (cid:4) N modification . Two cysteines , one in each of two short repeats within RanBP2 , were converted to serine . Modification reactions were carried out as in Figure 5A in the presence of wt Gst - BP2 or Gst - BP2 (cid:4)(cid:4) Cys . Analysis was by immunoblotting with (cid:2) SP100 antibodies rapid formation of Ubc9 thioesters indicates that this RanBP2 / Ubc9 Interact Transiently in Sp100 Modification step is not rate limiting in our Sp100 modification reac - tions . Using preformed Ubc9 - SUMO1 thioesters , we RanGAP1 * SUMO1 / RanBP2 and Ubc9 can be found in a stable complex ( Lee et al . , 1998 ; Saitoh et al . , 1997 ) , next measured the rate of SUMO1 transfer between Ubc9andSp100 . AsshowninFigure6B , BP2 (cid:4) FGclearly but it was not known whether Ubc9 binds directly to RanBP2 or SUMOylated RanGAP1 . We tested this by enhances Sp100 modification . The low efficiency com - pared to the modifications shown in Figure 5 is due to mixing the respective proteins and applying the mixture to gel filtration ( Figure 7A ) . Surprisingly , Ubc9 could bind the fact that Ubc9 reloading with SUMO1 was inhibited by ATP depletion . In conclusion , as expected for an stably to either protein ( as well as to unmodified RanGAP1 ) .

Ubiquitin E3ligases depend recently ( Saitoh et al . , 2001 ; Sampson et al . , 2001 ) . Con - sidering the stable interaction of RanBP2 with Ubc9 on cysteines , either as catalytic residues or as part of RING finger motifs ( Jackson et al . , 2000 ; Joazeiro and and its ability to interact with preformed Ubc9 - SUMO1 thioesters , we wanted to test whether RanBP2 functions Weissman , 2000 ) .

The only recognizable motif present in this domain is a short ation during Sp100 modification . In the first scenario , addition of a stoichiometric complex between RanBP2 internal repeat that is conserved in RanBP2s from differ - ent species . We generated a double mutant ( Gst - and Ubc9 should abolish the need for additional Ubc9 under all conditions . In the second scenario , free Ubc9 BP2 (cid:4)(cid:4) Cys ) in which one cysteine in each repeat was changed to serine . However , this double mutant still concentrations could influence the reaction rate by de - termining the efficiency of reassociation . We generated stimulated Sp100 modification ( Figure 6C ) . Alkylating agents also did not inhibit RanBP2 function ( data not two different complexes : a complex consisting just of BP2 (cid:4) FG and Ubc9 ( F13 ) , and a complex that also in - shown ) , suggesting that free cysteine side chains are not required for its function . These findings open up cluded RanGAP1 * SUMO1 tomimic the physiological sit - uation at the NPC . We first tested 1 (cid:5) l of each complex the intriguing possibility that the mechanism of RanBP2 activity is different from ubiquitin E3 ligases .

One model consistent with these observations is that SUMO1 - reactions . Both complexes efficiently stimulated Sp100 modification in the absence of additional Ubc9 ( Figure loaded Ubc9 binds to RanBP2 , transfers SUMO1 to its target , and dissociates again prior to its reloading by 7C , top , compare lanes 3 and 5 or lanes 4 and 6 ) , indicat - ing that the Ubc9 provided as part of either complex is Aos1 / Uba2 ( Figure 7D ) . catalytically active . We then repeated the experiment with less complex ( 0 . 3 (cid:5) l ) and a much shorter incubation Discussion time ( 5 min ) . Strikingly , under these conditions , the reac - tion was clearly dependent on the addition of free Ubc9 RanBP2 Is an E3 SUMO1 Ligase We have demonstrated here that both full - length ( Figure 7C , bottom , compare lanes 3 and 5 or 4 and 6 ) . The different efficiencies of F9 and F13 appear to be RanBP2 and a 33 kDa fragment of RanBP2 strongly enhance SUMO1 modification of Sp100 in the presence due to different levels of BP2 (cid:4) FG and Ubc9 in these fractions , rather than a contribution by RanGAP1 ( titra - of recombinant E1 and E2 enzymes . RanBP2 clearly functions catalytically , as 5 ng BP2 (cid:4) FG are sufficient to tion experiments , data not shown ) . In summary , these findings are not consistent with a model in which Ubc9 induce conversion of a 300 - fold molar excess of Sp100 ( Figure 5B , right ) . Does this make RanBP2 a SUMO1 E3 and RanBP2 function as a stable complex , but rather suggest that Ubc9 and RanBP2 undergo cycles of asso - ligase ? Ubiquitin E3 ligases are defined as “enzymes Cell118 that bind , directly or indirectly , specific protein sub - at least , this is not the case , since hypermodified BP2 (cid:4) FG still stimulates Sp100 modification ( data not strates and promote the transfer of ubiquitin , directly or indirectly , from a thioester intermediate to amide link - shown ) . Interestingly , both classes of SUMO1 E3 ligases seem to function on many different target proteins . We ageswithproteinsorpolyubiquitinchains” ( Hershkoand Ciechanover , 1998 ) . RanBP2interactsdirectlywithUbc9 find that RanBP2 stimulates modification of three out of six tested proteins , and gene disruption of Siz1 and and promotes SUMO1 modification of Sp100 by stimu - lating transfer of SUMO1 from Ubc9 to Sp100 .

Importantly , endogenous RanBP2 at the NPC will probably also interact with Sp100 by a second mechanism , due to its role as a docking site in nuclear RanBP2 May Coordinate SUMO1 Modification protein import .
