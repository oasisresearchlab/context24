Role of Lipids in Morphogenesis of T - Cell Microvilli Marek Cebecauer * Department of Biophysical Chemistry , J . Heyrovsky Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences ( CAS ) , Prague , Czechia T cells communicate with the environment via surface receptors . Cooperation of surface receptors regulates T - cell responses to diverse stimuli . Recently , ﬁ nger - like membrane protrusions , microvilli , have been demonstrated to play a role in the organization of receptors and , hence , T - cell activation . However , little is known about the morphogenesis of dynamic microvilli , especially in the cells of immune system . In this review , I focus on the potential role of lipids and lipid domains in morphogenesis of microvilli . Discussed is the option that clustering of sphingolipids with phosphoinositides at the plasma membrane results in dimpling ( curved ) domains . Such domains can attract phosphoinositide - binding proteins and stimulate actin cytoskeleton reorganization . This process triggers cortical actin opening and bundling of actin ﬁ bres to support the growing of microvilli . Critical regulators of microvilli morphogenesis in T cells are unknown . At the end , I suggest several candidates with a potential to organize proteins and lipids in these structures . Keywords : T cell , microvilli , sphingolipids , phosphoinositides , lipid rafts , membrane curvature , dimpling domains , membrane - associated proteins INTRODUCTION T lymphocytes , important supervisors of the immune system , are activated and regulated through receptors expressed on their surface . Surface of lymphocytes is densely covered by membrane protrusions , mainly microvilli ( 1 , 2 ) , which allow for a more complex three - dimensional ( 3D ) organization of receptors compared to a ﬂ at membrane . Indeed , critical receptors of T - cell activation , T cell receptor ( TCR ) , CD2 , CD4 and CD28 were shown to accumulate at the tips of microvilli in recent studies bene ﬁ tting from 3D imaging at high resolution ( 1 , 3 – 7 ) . On the contrary , CD45 is excluded from these areas ( 6 , 7 ) . It was suggested that non - random 3D distribution of receptors is important for optimisation of signalling and cellular responses ( 8 – 10 ) . However , little is known about the origin of microvilli and molecules involved in their formation and homeostasis in T lymphocytes . Insight into molecular biophysics and structural details of these membrane protrusions can help to better understand T - cell function in health and disease . In this work , I suggest the role of lipids and lipid domains in deformation of membranes and their potential role in the formation and organization of microvilli . I start with a brief introduction to microvilli structure and function . These data almost exclusively originate from studies of microvilli in epithelial cells . It is thus important to note here that microvilli of epithelial cells are more stable and may differ in structural details when compared to microvilli on leukocytes . In the central sections , I hypothezise a role of curved lipid domains in microvilli formation and describe regulatory role of lipids for the function of proteins localized prevalently to these structures .

Like lipid domains , function of these proteins in T cells needs to be determined . MICROVILLI AND THEIR STRUCTURE Microvilli are ﬁ nger - like membrane protrusions at the surface of metazoan cells ( 11 ) . Microvilli consist of the tip , shaft , and base , which connects these structures to the plasma membrane and cortical actin ( Figure 1 ) . Actin bundles determine a shape of microvilli and are responsible for their stability , but also a dynamic character . In the shaft , the membrane is tightly linked to actin bundles via actin - and membrane - binding proteins [ e . g . , myosins and ERM proteins ; see Figure 1 ( 12 ) ] . At the base , at least in epithelial cells , actin bundle terminates in the network of intermediate ﬁ laments known as ‘ terminal web ’ ( 13 , 14 ) . The size of microvilli is regulated by the growth of actin ﬁ bres at the tip ( 15 ) . Microvilli on the surface of polarized epithelial cells covering organs in direct contact with the exterior are rather stable and long ( 11 ) . Microvilli on T cells are smaller and highly dynamic ( 1 , 2 , 16 , 17 ) . With ~ 100 nm in a diameter and a length of 0 . 5 – 5 µm , they represent rather small surface structures [ Figure 1 in ( 17 ) and Figure 1 in ( 1 ) ] . It is their abundance and ﬂ exibility , which makes these structures important for T - cell function . For example , vesicles with receptors and other effector molecules can be shed off the microvilli tips . This phenomenon was observed in epithelia , as well as in T cells , and can be part of complex regulatory mechanisms in multicellular organisms ( 1 , 18 ) . The accumulation of receptors at the tip of microvilli is bene ﬁ ciary for an easy access to ligands , substrates or mechanical forces and can determine cellular responses to such stimuli ( 8 , 9 , 11 ) . The shaft and the base potentially function as a selecting region , segregating molecules to different membrane environments . However , physico - chemical basis of such selection remains unknown . Importantly , it is still unclear what de ﬁ nes a local onset and chemical composition of microvilli . In the following sections , I suggest a model ( Figure 1 ) , in which membrane lipids and their physico - chemical properties trigger the onset of microvilli formation . LIPID DOMAINS AND LOCAL BENDING OF MEMBRANES In our review on membrane lipid nanodomains [ ( 19 ) , Section 8 . 4 ] , we discussed a role of curvature in stabilization of domains and prevention of their fusion . In general , formation of a lipid domain with different properties ( e . g . , rigidity and thickness ) compared to the adjacent membrane results in line tension at the boundary ( borderline ) between the two ‘ phases ’ ( Figure 2A ) . In FIGURE 1 | A model of T - cell microvilli morphogenesis . The onset of microvilli can be triggered by transient formation of dimpling lipid domains ( see also Figure 2 ) . Sphingolipids together with phosphoinositides ( e . g . , phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ; PIP 2 ) own a high potential to form dimpling domains in asymmetric membranes . Later , actin - binding proteins , which associate with plasma membrane via PIP 2 ( or phosphatidylserine ) , induce cortical actin opening and stabilize dimpling domains . Similar proteins can stimulate bundling of actin ﬁ bres . The growth of microvilli is driven by polymerization of actin at the plus end of the ﬁ bres ( distal end of microvilli ) . Myosins dynamically anchor actin bundles to the membrane at the shaft . ERM ( ezrin , radixin , and moesin ) proteins function in a similar fashion ( membrane anchor ) and regulate stability of microvilli . Proteins with af ﬁ nity for rigid ( sphingolipid - enriched ) and / or for curved membranes accumulate at the tip or shaft of microvilli . Little is known about T - cell signalling molecules in the lumen of microvilli . The existence of terminal web in microvilli of leukocytes remains unknown . Components of microvilli are not drawn in scale . Cebecauer Lipids and T - Cell Microvilli Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 613591 2 a growing domain , the length of boundary increases , and line tension rises . However , lipid membranes prefer to minimize tensions associated with their organization ( 20 , 21 ) . Since elastic properties ( bending modulus ) of membranes are not changing signi ﬁ cantly , the size of a domain can reach the point , at which membrane starts to bend and form dimpling domains [ Figure 2B ( 22 , 23 ) ] . This is caused by the fact that line tension at the boundary exceeds the bending energy ( resistance ) of a membrane required for its deformation . Membrane bending reduces the boundary length and , thus , line tension . Further A B FIGURE 2 | Growth of lipid nanodomains and dimpling ( curved ) domain formation . ( A ) Schematic illustration of lipid membrane with a domain . The domain has different physico - chemical properties ( e . g . , rigidity - conformational order , thickness ) compared to the surrounding lipid bilayer . The two environments are separated by the boundary . ( B ) Schematic illustration of a domain growth and formation of a dimpling domain . Certain lipids ( e . g . , sphingolipids and cholesterol ) tend to segregate into circular domains in synthetic membranes containing unsaturated glycerophospholipids due to their immiscibility at lower temperatures or in the presence of other clustering factors ( e . g . , proteins ) . As the domain grows , line tension at the boundary increases , until it reaches the point , at which it exceeds bending energy required for membrane deformation and dimpling domain is formed . The length of the boundary is reduced , and further growth of the membrane is accompanied by membrane tubulation , but not increase in line tension . Hence , domain formation can lead to induction of membrane curvature and its tubulation . Cebecauer Lipids and T - Cell Microvilli Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 613591 3 growth of a domain is enabled by enhanced curvature , which can result in membrane tubulation . The length of boundary and line tension remain constant for such growing domain / protrusion ( 21 ) . In ﬂ at membranes , small domains diminish due to their fusion into larger entities , as observed in model , phase - separated giant unilamellar vesicles ( 24 ) . Fusion of small domains reduces the length of boundary and line tension ( 23 ) . However , large lipid domains are not frequent in cells . It is currently agreed that the plasma membrane is highly heterogenous due to the presence of small ( nanometric ) domains ( 25 , 26 ) . One can thus speculate that plasma membrane is prone to form dimpling domains , which cannot fuse due to repulsive forces at their boundaries ( 19 , 22 ) . CLUSTERING OF SPHINGOLIPIDS AND PHOSPHOINOSITIDES TRIGGERS MICROVILLI FORMATION Cellular membranes are composed of a large variety of lipid species . Among those , sphingolipids , with their long and saturated acyl chains and af ﬁ nity to cholesterol , are prone to segregate from unsaturated glycerophospholipids and form nanodomains ( 19 , 27 – 29 ) . Ikenouchi and colleagues suggested that sphingolipids are required for the existence of microvilli and , potentially , also initiation of their formation in epithelial cells ( 30 ) . Conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramides by acidic sphingomyelinase in these cells led to impaired microvilli . In untreated cells , sphingolipids accumulated on microvilli ( 30 ) . Accumulation of sphingomyelin ( and cholesterol ) in microvilli was con ﬁ rmed in another study , which employed lysenin labeling of sphingomyelin ( perfolysin O for cholesterol ) and sensitive nanoSIMS imaging in CHO - K1 epithelial - like cells ( 31 ) . Of note , only freely accessible lipids could be detected using this method . In another study , interference with sphingolipid or cholesterol synthesis lead to reduced presence of microvilli on epithelial cells ( 32 ) . All these studies indicate that sphingolipids are essential for the morphogenesis of microvilli . Membrane lipid composition considerably differs between various cell types . Though sphingolipids consistently constitute 20 - 40 % of plasma membrane lipids ( 33 , 34 ) . Local concentration of sphingolipids is even higher due to chemical asymmetry of the plasma membrane ( lipid bilayer ) . Such high content of sphingolipids in the outer lea ﬂ et can lead to their transient clustering and , occasionally , formation of dimpling domains . Indeed , bilayer asymmetry reduces bending modulus of a membrane and , thus , facilitates its deformation ( 22 , 35 ) . In cells , phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) molecules were found to cluster underneath sphingolipid domains during membrane deformation induced by viral proteins [ virion budding ( 36 , 37 ) ] . PIP 2 was also found to accumulate in microvilli ( 30 ) . But comprehensive analysis of lipids in microvilli has not been performed to date ( 38 ) . Therefore , it is unclear what is the content of PIP 2 , sphingolipids and other lipids ( e . g . , cholesterol ) in these structures . The presence of PIP 2 in the apical membrane of epithelial cells , but of phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) in basolateral membrane , further supports the involvement of this lipid in microvilli formation ( 39 ) . Microvilli can be found only on the apical surface of epithelial cells . Apical membrane of polarized cells is also enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol ( 40 ) . Moreover , PIP 2 accumulates in the uropod of motile cells , whereas PIP 3 can be found in the leading edge . Microvilli are often observed at the back of motile cells , including T cells ( 17 , 41 , 42 ) . In analogy to sphingomyelin domains , cholesterol facilitates clustering of PIP 2 ( 43 ) . Due to its high lateral and transbilayer mobility ( 44 , 45 ) , cholesterol is expected to freely access dimpling domains . Interestingly , cholesterol does not in ﬂ uence bending modulus of synthetic membranes with diverse lipid composition ( 46 , 47 ) . Thus , cholesterol does not directly raise the energy required for membrane deformation and establishment of dimpling membranes , but the effect can depend on its intramembrane orientation and distribution between the outer and inner lea ﬂ et ( 45 ) . LIPID - PROTEIN CROSSTALK IN MICROVILLAR MORPHOGENESIS AND FUNCTION To further highlight the importance of lipids in microvilli morphogenesis , I will describe three examples where lipid metabolism determines the function of critical proteins in microvilli . The examples were selected based on the depth of our understanding of these regulatory processes . As in the case of microvilli structure , this knowledge comes from microvilli of epithelial cells , but similar regulatory mechanisms can be expected in T - cells . ERM family proteins ( ezrin , radixin , and moesin ) tightly anchor actin - bundles to the membrane of microvilli . This is facilitated by binding of their FERM domain to PIP 2 ( 48 ) . The process is regulated by a local lipid environment . Conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide and of sphingosine to sphingosine - 1 - phosphate negatively and positively , respectively , regulate membrane - association of ERM proteins and , thus , stability of microvilli ( 49 , 50 ) . The role of ERM proteins for microvilli is evidently critical , since their knock - down leads to their reduced size and number ( 51 , 52 ) . Podocalyxin - 1 accumulates in microvilli of epithelial cells . Podocalyxin - 1 interacts with ERM proteins via EBP50 ( 53 ) . It further interacts with phosphoinositide - 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase ( PI5K ) b and delivers this critical enzyme to microvilli . The formation of podocalyxin - 1 multiprotein complex with PI5K leads to a local increase in PIP 2 synthesis and stability of microvilli ( 30 ) . Interestingly , podocalyxin - 1 associates with sphingolipid domains , probably upon its palmitoylation ( 54 ) . The crosstalk of diverse lipids in the regulation of this protein remains unknown . Another protein associating with sphingolipid domains on microvilli is prominin - 1 [ also called CD133 ( 55 ) ] . Overexpression of prominin - 1 increases a number of microvilli ( 56 ) . This protein directly binds cholesterol and GM1 ganglioside ( 57 ) . These lipid - Cebecauer Lipids and T - Cell Microvilli Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 613591 4 protein interactions were found essential for ﬁ ne tuning of microvillar structure . The protein is further regulated by phosphorylation of its regulatory tyrosines [ Y 817 / Y 828 ( 56 ) ] . Phosphorylation of these tyrosines regulates interaction of prominin - 1 with phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) . In contrast to PI5K , PI3K locally reduces available PIP 2 by its conversion to PIP 3 and destabilizes the anchorage of actin bundles to the membrane ( 56 ) . POTENTIAL REGULATORS OF MICROVILLI IN T CELLS I have argued above that lipid domains induce curvature in ﬂ at regions of the plasma membrane . Such domains would be transient in the absence of supporting proteins ( Figure 1 ) . The process is well described for the endocytosis or viral budding ( 36 , 37 , 58 – 61 ) . For example , matrix proteins ( e . g . , Gag of HIV - 1 ) form a dome - like structure under the curved membrane of nascent viral particles . Proteins stabilizing dimpling domains at the sites of newly assembling microvilli have not been described yet . A few proteins ( e . g . , prominin - 1 / CD133 , podocalyxin - 1 ) reported to regulate microvilli morphogenesis in epithelial cells ( 30 , 55 ) , are not expressed in T cells or at highly variable levels in diverse T - cell subsets . Their role in microvilli morphogenesis in T cells is thus questionable . Here , I will focus on four proteins ( protein families ) , which exhibit great potential to induce or stabilize microvilli in T cells . The geometry and chemistry of dimpling domains delineates properties of potential supporting proteins . These must interact with negative curvature and anionic lipids . I - BAR domain proteins exhibit such properties . IRSp53 contains I - BAR domain and was shown to induce negative curvature and tubulation in synthetic vesicles ( 62 ) . IRSp53 localizes to curved membranes of neuronal cells ( 63 ) and ﬁ lopodia of motile ﬁ broblasts ( 64 ) . It supports membrane ruf ﬂ ing and protrusions in T cells ( 65 ) . In epithelial cells , it is expressed at the microvilli - containing apical membrane and functionally associates with podocalyxin - 1 ( 66 ) . As a protein of countless functions , it will be important to characterize its speci ﬁ c role in microvilli of T cells . Alternatively , other I - BAR domain - containing proteins can ful ﬁ l this function in lymphoid cells . Tetherin ( also called CD317 ) with af ﬁ nity for ordered , sphingolipid - rich membranes interacts with BAR domain - containing RICH family proteins ( 67 ) . Tetherin / RICH - 2 complex forms a mechanical support of epithelial microvilli ( 68 ) . Its analog , RICH - 1 , is expressed in T - cells ( Human Protein Atlas ) . BAR domain of RICH proteins can induce positive curvature and tubulate lipid vesicles containing PIP 2 in the absence of tetherin ( 69 ) . The potential of tetherin / RICH complex thus lies at the neck connecting microvilli ( or dimpling domains ) to membrane base via a positively curved segment ( Figure 1 ) . Unconventional myosins ( e . g . , myo1a , myo7b ) link actin ﬁ bres to membrane by their interaction with anionic lipids , PIP 2 or phosphatidylserine ( 70 ) . Myosins also contribute to the formation of a ‘ hole ’ in the cortical actin at the site of new microvillus formation ( 71 ) . Such local depletion of cortical actin is essential for the initiation of membrane protrusions ( 72 ) . This process may be also connected to the formation and stabilization of dimpling lipid domains . Members of tetraspanin protein superfamily ( TM4SF ) accumulate at the microvilli of diverse cells . CD9 , CD81 , CD82 , and TSPAN33 were shown to control the size and shape of microvilli in both , leukocytes and epithelial cells ( 73 – 75 ) . TM4SF proteins ( e . g . , CD81 ) require highly curved membrane for their assembly into virus - like particles induced by HIV - 1 Gag protein ( 37 , 76 ) . The main role of TM4SF is thus expected for growing or established microvilli with highly curved tubular membrane . None of the proteins mentioned in this section was already determined as a microvilli regulator in T cells . However , I believe that intense research in this direction may soon offer interesting discoveries related not only to microvilli , but also to T - cell signaling and function . CONCLUSIONS Recent observations demonstrate that microvilli play essential role in T - cell activation . Key signalling molecules were found to accumulate in different parts of these morphological structures . Theoretical and biophysical studies indicate that sphingolipids and phosphoinositides in complex asymmetric membranes tend to generate dimpling domains . In the plasma membrane of T cells , dimpling domains can be the sites of an onset of microvilli , as indicated in the presented model . Speci ﬁ c lipids also ﬁ ne tune behaviour of critical regulatory proteins in microvilli . These data substantiate the role of lipids in morphogenesis and function of microvilli . However , in T cells , the identity of key proteins ( and lipids ) in microvilli remains unknown . Future works are required to discover these important organizers of signalling receptors at the plasma membrane of T cells . Such research may open new avenues for treatment of many human diseases , which are associated with the malfunction of these critical immune cells .
