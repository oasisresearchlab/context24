In land birds , ketocarotenoids such as astax - anthin are usually metabolically derived via ketolation of dietary yellow carotenoids [ 9 , 10 ] . However , the molecular basis of this gene - environment mechanism has remained obscure . Here we use the yellowbeak mutation in the zebra ﬁnch ( Taeniopygia guttata ) to investigate the genetic basis of red coloration . Wild - type ketocarotenoids were absent in the beak and tarsus of yellowbeak birds . The yellowbeak mutation mapped to chromosome 8 , close to a cluster of cyto - chrome P450 loci ( CYP2J2 - like ) that are candidates for carotenoid ketolases . The wild - type zebra ﬁnch genome was found to have three intact genes in this cluster : CYP2J19A , CYP2J19B , and CYP2J40 . In yellowbeak , there are multiple mutations : loss of a complete CYP2J19 gene , a modiﬁed remaining CYP2J19 gene ( CYP2J19 yb ) , and a non - synonymous SNP in CYP2J40 . In wild - type birds , CYP2J19 loci are expressed in ketocarotenoid - containing tissues : CYP2J19A only in the retina and CYP2J19B in the beak and tarsus and to a variable extent in the retina . In contrast , expression of CYP2J19 yb is barely detect - able in the beak of yellowbeak birds . CYP2J40 has broad tissue expression and shows no differences be - tween wild - type and yellowbeak . Our results indicate that CYP2J19 genes are strong candidates for the carotenoid ketolase and imply that ketolation occurs in the integument in zebra ﬁnches . Since cytochrome P450 enzymes include key detoxiﬁcation enzymes , our results raise the intriguing possibility that red coloration may be an honest signal of detoxiﬁcation ability . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Bright - red coloration of skin or plumage is a major component of avian color diversity and depends , with few exceptions , on the ability to enzymatically convert yellow dietary carotenoids ( xan - thophylls ) to red C4 ketocarotenoid pigments such as astaxan - thin or canthaxanthin . Carotenoid ketolation is thus an important keyinnovationinavianevolutionandcolordiversiﬁcation [ 11 – 13 ] , and many well - known examples of sexually selected visual dis - playsinvolvebright - redketocarotenoidcolorationintheplumage or beak , functioning to attract partners or to deter rivals ( e . g . , [ 5 – 8 ] ) . The anatomical location of ketolation has been conten - tious . The absence of ketocarotenoids in the blood plasma of some birds suggests peripheral action , close to or in the ketocar - otenoid - pigmented tissues , such as the beak or feather follicles [ 14 ] . In other species , high concentrations of ketocarotenoids in the plasma imply transport to the periphery from the tissue where ketolation occurs [ 15 , 16 ] , which is likely to be the liver [ 17 ] . Ketocarotenoids also occur in avian retinas , where astaxan - thin is the pigment in the red oil droplets [ 18 ] that are present in longwave - sensitive ( LWS ) cones and act as cut - off ﬁlters to improve color discrimination [ 19 ] . The mechanism behind retinal astaxanthin , and its relationship with integumentary ketocarote - noid pigmentation is unknown . Male zebra ﬁnches have ketocarotenoid - based red bill color - ation , which is a classical sexually selected trait , with females preferring males with redder bills [ 6 ] . Males also have red tarsi , and females have less saturated red bills and tarsi , containing the same ketocarotenoids as the males at lower concentrations [ 18 ] . The yellowbeak mutation , only described from captive birds , has yellow bills and tarsi in both sexes and is considered an autosomal recessive mutation among cage - bird enthusiasts ( Figure 1 ) [ 20 ] . Ketocarotenoids Are Absent in the Beak of yellowbeak Birds High - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) analysis of ca - rotenoids extracted from the beak of yellowbeak birds revealed the presence of dietary yellow carotenoids and an absence of the four red ketocarotenoids ( astaxanthin , canthaxanthin , a - dor - adexanthin , and adonirubin ) present in wild - type birds ( Figure 2 ) . This is consistent with a role for the yellowbeak mutation in the metabolic conversion of dietary carotenoids to ketocarotenoids . Yellowbeak Maps to a Narrow Region of Chromosome 8 Containing Candidate Ketolase Genes Weﬁrstmappedthe yellowbeak mutationusing352 genome - wide SNPs in a pedigree of 95 birds . A total of 17 ( 0 . 28 ) of the second - generation birds expressed the yellowbeak phenotype , almost Current Biology 26 , 1 – 6 , June 6 , 2016 ª 2016 The Author ( s ) .

The yellow - beak traitwas genetically linked toa singleSNP onchromosome8 ( Tgu8 ) ( two - point linkage of yellowbeak to Tgu _ SNP _ 01464 ; recombination fraction = 0 cM ; logarithm of the odds [ LOD ] = 5 . 72 ; position of SNP on assembly = 25 . 44 Mb ) ( Figure 3A ) . We next performed ﬁne - scale mapping in this region , obtain - ing data from 39 SNPs between 15 . 02 and 27 . 73 Mb on chromo - some 8 . Six consecutive markers , positioned between 24 . 01 Mb and 25 . 35 Mb , produced recombination fractions of zero with yellowbeak ( Table S2 ; Figure 3B ) . The ﬂanking markers with some recombination to yellowbeak are located at 22 . 85 Mb and 25 . 68 Mb , and so yellowbeak must lie within this 2 . 83 Mb in - terval . In fact , the ﬁne mapping provides strong support for a much narrower interval . At the central four of the r = 0 markers , the F2 yellowbeak birds and F0 yellowbeak founders had iden - tical genotypes ( Figure S1 ) . The ﬁrst and sixth markers were the least informative and so had lower power to detect recombi - nation events with yellowbeak ( Table S2 ) . The two markers with highest LOD scores were rs83092174 ( LOD score = 7 . 53 ) , which is located at 24 , 442 , 889 bp on chromosome 8 , and rs83092728 ( LOD score = 6 . 92 ) , which is located at 24 , 628 , 232 bp . The two ﬂanking markers had weaker support ( LOD = 5 . 42 in both cases ) , and the interval spanning the ﬂanking markers covers 24 . 269 – 25 . 029 Mb . This interval contains ﬁve genes on the zebra ﬁnch genome assembly , two CYP2J2 - like loci , NF1A , HOOK , and FGGY ( Figure 3C ) . Thus , there is greatest statistical support for yellowbeak to reside within this 0 . 76 Mb window , but because some F1 parents are not informative at all SNPs , an extended 2 . 83 Mb cannot be ruled out by the mapping data alone . The CYP s encode a large family of cytochrome P450 oxidases that are good candidates for carotenoid ketolases . Speciﬁcally , a fungal CYP encodes a carotenoid ketolase [ 21 ] , and vertebrate CYP26 s encode retinoic acid oxidases , which perform an oxida - tion of the terminal carbon ring of retinoic acid to 4 - oxo - retinoic acid that is chemically similar to the reaction performed by carotenoid ketolases [ 22 ] . The CYP2J2 - like cluster on chromo - some 8 lies right under the LOD peak in yellowbeak birds at 24 . 573 – 24 . 586 Mb . In contrast , NF1A ( encoding a nuclear family 1 transcription factor ) , HOOK ( encoding a microtubule - binding Figure 1 . The yellowbeak Phenotype Male wild - type ( left ) and yellowbeak ( right ) zebra ﬁnches .

We therefore targeted the CYP2J2 - like clus - ter as a candidate region for yellowbeak . Yellowbeak Is Associated with a Deletion of a CYP2J2 - like Locus Preliminary gene expression results indi - cated an association of expression of a CYP2J19 locus on chromosome 8 and the yellowbeak phenotype ( see below ) . Further investigation led to the discovery of errors in the current zebra ﬁnch genome assembly ( Tae - gut3 . 2 . 4 ) in this region . The existing assembly indicates two adjacent CYP2J2 - like loci on chromosome 8 , with a further two CYP2J2 - like loci on an unassembled chromosome 8 contig . Us - ing a combination of long - range PCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing , we found direct evidence for three adjacent CYP2J2 - like loci on chromosome 8 , incorporating some sequence from the previously unanchored region ( Figure 3D ; Supplemental Experimental Procedures ; Figure S1B ) . Two of these loci , which we term CYP2J19A and CYP2J19B , are close homologs related to chicken CYP2J19 , whereas the third , CYP2J40 , is more distantly related . Long - range PCR results indicated the presence of an (cid:1) 13 kb deletion of a full copy of CYP2J19 in yellowbeak birds ( Fig - ureS1D ) . Using aPCR assay ( Figure S1C ) , we found aperfect as - sociation between this deletion and yellowbeak ( Fisher’s exact test of association between phenotype and absence of the wild - typeallele , p = 1 . 16 3 10 (cid:3) 8 ) : all yellowbeak birdswerehomo - zygous for the deletion ( N = 12 ) , whereas wild - type birds were homozygous ( N = 9 ) or heterozygous ( N = 9 ) for the intact allele . The single copy of CYP2J19 in yellowbeak birds , CYP2J19 yb , is divergent from both wild - type CYP2J19 loci and has four unique amino acid substitutions . Phylogenetic reconstruction shows that it is closer to CYP2J19B than CYP2J19A , implying that the mutation may have involved a full deletion of CYP2J19A ( Figure S2A ) . Substantial allelic variation in wild - type alleles of CYP2J19B , but not CYP2J19A , was detected , with two diver - gent allelic lineages present ( Figure S2A ) . A 76 bp indel poly - morphism in CYP2J19 yb only was found (cid:1) 600 bp upstream of the start codon . An intact copy of the other CYP2J2 - like locus on chromosome 8 , CYP2J40 , is present in yellowbeak , and this encodes a protein with a single amino acid substitution ( Y209N ) compared to wild - type CYP2J40 . CYP2J19 Loci Are Speciﬁcally Expressed in Ketocarotenoid - Containing Tissues , and Bill Expression Is Greatly Reduced in yellowbeak In wild - type birds , we detected expression of CYP2J19 loci in the beak , tarsus , and retina , which are all sites of ketocarotenoid deposition , but not in the heart , or liver and duodenum , which 2 Current Biology 26 , 1 – 6 , June 6 , 2016 Please cite this article in press as : Mundy et al . , Red Carotenoid Coloration in the Zebra Finch Is Controlled by a Cytochrome P450 Gene Cluster , Current Biology ( 2016 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . cub . 2016 . 04 . 047 are important sites for carotenoid metabolism and uptake ( Fig - ure S2B ) . CYP2J19A expression was detected only in the retina , whereas CYP2J19B was strongly expressed in the beak and tarsus , with variable expression in the retina ( Figure S2C ) . In contrast , CYP2J40 was expressed in all of these tissues ( data not shown ) . In qRT - PCR experiments , CYP2J19 yb expression was barely detectable in the bill of yellowbeak birds ( Figure 4A ) and was signiﬁcantly lower than expression of CYP2J19B in wild - type birds ( two - tailed t test , p < 0 . 05 ) . In contrast , CYP2J19 yb ex - pression was present in yellowbeak retinas and similar to that of CYP2J19A / B inwild - typeretinas ( Figure4B ) . Therewerenodiffer - ences in CYP2J40 expression between yellowbeak and wild - type bills ( Figures 4C and 4D ) . Taking genetic and expression data together , our results suggest that the deletion in yellowbeak removed both CYP2J19A and cis - regulatory sequences driving expression of CYP2J19B in the beak , bringing CYP2J19 yb under controlof cis - regulatorysequencesof CYP2J19A , therebydriving expression of CYP2J19 yb in the retina . The bills of female zebra ﬁnches have the same ketocarote - noids as males , but at lower concentrations . In an experiment to investigate potential sex - biased expression , we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in CYP2J19B expression in the bills of wild - type males and females ( Figure S2D ) . Taken together , our results strongly suggest that the CYP2J2 - like cluster is required for red ketocarotenoid coloration . The pattern of expression of CYP2J19 loci strongly implicates a role of CYP2J19B in red beak and tarsus pigmentation and suggests that CYP2J19A is probably involved in astaxanthin pro - duction in the retina , potentially in combination with CYP2J19B . Since CYP2J40 has a ﬁxed mutational difference in yellowbeak , we cannot rule out an additional role of this locus in coloration . Figure 3 .

These results concur with an independent study that has used introgression of red coloration into the canary to identify CYP2J19 as a putative ketolase [ 23 ] . Direct experiments on the biochemical properties of the enzymes will be required to conﬁrm this . Our results further demonstrate the utility of mutations in domesticated forms for identifying novel loci involved in evolutionarily relevant avian coloration [ 24 , 25 ] . The speciﬁc expression of CYP2J19 loci in the tissues where ketocarotenoids are deposited ( beak , tarsus , and retina ) pro - vides strong circumstantial evidence that they play a direct role in ketocarotenoid presence in those tissues . The absence of CYP2J19 expression in the liver of zebra ﬁnches is striking since the majority of CYP s are expressed there , where many of them act as detoxiﬁcation enzymes . Our results therefore provide clear support for the peripheral model of ketolase conversion in zebra ﬁnches , where ketolation occurs in the tissues where ketocarotenoids are deposited . Further , they suggest an intriguing genetic link between ketocarotenoids used for red coloration and those used for color vision . The presence of red oil droplets is thought to be conserved across birds [ 26 ] , whereas red coloration is patchily distributed [ 13 ] , so a role of CYP2J2 - like loci in color vision is likely to have evolved prior to a function in coloration . Ancestry of yellowbeak and CYP2J19 Duplication The presence of a derived indel polymorphism that only occurs on the yellowbeak haplotype and multiple ﬁxed mutations in the CYP2J2 - like cluster in yellowbeak together imply that yellow - beak is an old mutation that probably predates domestication . In a preliminary analysis to determine whether the yellowbeak allele is still segregating in the wild , we genotyped 50 wild zebra ﬁnches from a wild population and did not detect the yellowbeak deletion ( data not shown ) . The apparent origin of the yellowbeak allele in the wild together with the presence of divergent alleles of CYP2J19B segregating in wild - type zebra ﬁnches suggests interesting evolutionary dynamics at this locus , perhaps including selection , that warrant further study . The contribution of other genetic variation at CYP2J19B to beak color variation is another interesting question . A quantitative trait locus study of beak redness in captive zebra ﬁnches did not ﬁnd evidence for a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 8 , although sugges - tive linkage to loci associated with beak color was detected on four other chromosomes [ 27 ] . Blast searches of available avian genomes , published studies on avian CYP s [ 28 , 29 ] and our unpublished data from weaver - birds ( Ploceidae ) ( H . T . , unpublished data ) , which are closely related to estrildids , indicate that most other birds , from chickens to canaries , have a single CYP2J19 locus . Hence , the duplication of CYP2J19 in zebra ﬁnches into copies with their own tissue - speciﬁc expression is relatively recent . It will be inter - esting to determine when the duplication occurred in the avian phylogeny and whether it was associated with a change in color signaling . Implications for Sexual Selection A key issue in sexual selection research is the maintenance of honest signaling [ 30 ] . For carotenoid - based displays , much of the extensive literature has focused on the resource allocation hypothesis , the notion that it may be costly to irreversibly divert carotenoids to coloration from other physiological roles such as immune defense and antioxidant functions [ 31 – 33 ] . In other hy - potheses , such as the ‘‘shared - pathway hypothesis , ’’ some or all carotenoids may not themselves be limiting resources , but their uptake and metabolism , in particular ketocarotenoid deri - vation , may be intricately linked to crucial aspects of phenotypic and / or genetic quality , such as vitamin A homeostasis [ 34 , 35 ] ( but see 36 ] ) or respiratory efﬁciency [ 37 ] . Our ﬁnding that cytochrome P450s are involved in carotenoid metabolism brings an exciting new perspective to this ﬁeld . The cytochrome P450 oxidase enzymes , present in all living organisms , are primary metabolizers of foreign substances . In vertebrates , they are best known as detoxiﬁcation enzymes [ 38 ] , sharing several basic requirements for their function , including protein cofactors Figure 4 .

Many cytochrome P450s are expressed in the inner mitochondrial membrane [ 38 ] , leading to a potential direct association between ketolation and respiration [ 35 ] . An alternative and more speciﬁc ‘‘honest signaling’’ hypothesis is that CYP2J2 - based ketocarotenoid coloration is advertising some aspect of cytochrome P450 functionality in general ( tis - sue - speciﬁc or systemic ) , such as detoxiﬁcation ability .
