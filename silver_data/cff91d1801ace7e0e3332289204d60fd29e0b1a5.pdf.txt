We 53 previously discovered that variants in NOS1AP , encoding nitric oxide synthase 1 ( NOS1 ) adaptor 54 protein , cause monogenic nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) . Here , we determined that an intergenic 55 splice product of N OS1AP / Nos1ap and neighboring C1orf226 / Gm7694 , which precludes NOS1 56 binding , is the predominant isoform in mammalian kidney transcriptional and proteomic data . 57 Gm7694 - / - mice , whose allele exclusively disrupts the intergenic product , developed NS 58 phenotypes . In two human NS subjects , we identified causative NOS1AP splice variants , including 59 one predicted to abrogate intergenic splicing but initially misclassified as benign based on the 60 canonical transcript . Finally , by modifying genetic background , we generated a faithful mouse 61 model of NOS1AP - associated NS , which responded to anti - proteinuric treatment . This study 62 highlights the importance of intergenic splicing and a potential treatment avenue in a mendelian 63 disorder . 64 65 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

NS presents 67 with edema , hypoalbuminemia , and proteinuria , arising from disruption of the glomerular filtration 68 barrier comprised primarily of interconnected podocytes ( 2 ) . Treatment resistant NS ( steroid - 69 resistant NS or SRNS ) frequently progresses to end - stage kidney disease concomitant with 70 podocyte loss ( 1 – 3 ) . Mendelian genetic forms represent the most severe subset of NS ( 4 – 7 ) . 71 72 Monogenic NS genes are predominantly expressed in glomerular podocytes ( 8 ) , encoding 73 proteins essential for podocyte development or homeostasis ( 2 , 9 ) . Patient variants in disease 74 proteins impair podocyte structure and function ( 2 , 8 ) , causing podocytopathies . For example , 75 variants in > 10 genes encoding actin cytoskeleton regulators have been shown to cause nephrotic 76 syndrome in humans and mice ( 10 – 19 ) . Despite the interconnected nature of these genetic 77 etiologies , specific treatments are lacking . 78 79 Causative genetic variants are detected in 11 - 30 % of SRNS cases ( 4 – 7 ) . For families lacking a 80 genetic diagnosis , variant classification can be hindered by transcript annotation based on non - 81 kidney tissues . Understanding kidney - specific isoform expression will facilitate discovery of novel 82 disease variants and genes , broadening our mechanistic understanding of NS and impacting 83 clinical care for kidney disease patients with an established genetic diagnosis . 84 85 We , previously , discovered that recessive variants in NOS1AP / Nos1ap , affecting N - terminal 86 domains , caused early onset NS in human subjects and a podocytopathy in C57BL / 6 - Nos1ap Ex3 - 87 / Ex3 - mice ( Figure S1 ) ( 20 ) . This locus encodes nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein with an N - 88 terminal phosphotyrosine binding ( PTB ) domain , and C - terminal PDZ binding domain ( PDZ - BD ) , 89 through which it interacts with NOS1 ( Figure S1 ) ( 21 – 26 ) . We determined that NOS1AP co - 90 localized with actin - based filopodia in podocytes and with podocyte marker nephrin in kidney 91 sections . NS patient variants impaired filopodia formation and podocyte migration ( 20 ) . NOS1AP 92 acted upstream of the NS - associated CDC42 / formin pathway , supporting its key role in the actin 93 regulatory network ( 20 ) . 94 95 While the C - terminal NOS1AP - NOS1 interaction is important for neuronal NO signaling and 96 required for hippocampal neuron - mediated anxiolysis ( 27 , 28 ) , impairing NOS1 function did not 97 All rights reserved .

This alternative transcript encodes a distinct C - 104 terminal domain lacking the PDZ - BD that mediates NOS1 interactions ( 23 – 26 ) . The role of this 105 alternative transcript in kidney physiology and disease is unknown . 106 107 In the current study , we delineate an intergenic splice isoform of N OS1AP / Nos1ap and 108 neighboring locus C1orf226 / Gm7694 by interrogation of transcriptional and proteomic data from 109 human and murine kidneys . The intergenic form predominates over the canonical transcript in 110 adult kidney tissue . We , next , hypothesized that novel variants in NOS1AP / Nos1ap cause NS and 111 expand the genotype - phenotype relationship between this locus and kidney disease . Gm7694 - / - 112 mice , predicted to exclusively disrupt the intergenic NOS1AP splice product , developed a 113 podocytopathy . These findings were mirrored in novel Nos1ap Ex4 - / Ex4 - mice with an early out - of - 114 frame deletion and consistent with our published Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - in - frame deletion mouse model . 115 Supporting the role of the NOS1AP C - terminus in humans , we identified two novel recessive 116 variants in NOS1AP , predicted to impair splicing of the penultimate coding exon and the intergenic 117 product , in two cases of pediatric onset NS . Collectively , this suggests that novel variants , which 118 impact novel regions and splice isoforms of NOS1AP / Nos1ap , lead to kidney disease . To evaluate 119 the impact of genetic modifying factors , the Nos1ap Ex3 - allele was bred from a C57BL / 6 120 background onto the FVB / N background . FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice exhibited 10 - fold higher 121 albuminuria than C57BL / 6 - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice and developed kidney dysfunction , supporting the 122 relevance of genetic background for Nos1ap - variant associated disease . Finally , FVB / N - 123 Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice were treated with Renin - Angiotensin - Aldosterone - System ( RAAS ) inhibitor 124 lisinopril , which reduced albuminuria and prevented premature death . Overall , our findings 125 demonstrate that variants in the intergenic NOS1AP - C1orf226 locus cause a podocytopathy 126 responsive to pharmacologic treatment . 127 All rights reserved .

This alternative transcript encodes a distinct C - terminal domain lacking 132 the PDZ - BD that mediates NOS1 interactions ( 23 – 26 ) ( Figure 1A , S1 ) . We sought to study this 133 splice isoform further in mammalian kidneys , as ( i ) its product may mediate distinct protein 134 interaction partners and biological roles than the canonical protein , and ( ii ) interpretation of genetic 135 variants in individuals could be dramatically altered in light of tissue - specific isoforms . 136 137 By RT - PCR of total RNA from 8 - week - old mouse C57BL / 6 kidneys , both contiguous canonical 138 ( blue only ) and intergenic Nos1ap transcripts ( blue and green ) were detected ( Figure 1B - C , S2A - 139 D ) . The intergenic splice product arises from joining 153 nucleotides from exon 10 of Nos1ap to 140 exons 1 - 2 of predicted gene Gm7694 ( Figure 1A , 1C , S1 ) . To quantify the relative abundance of 141 these isoforms , re - analysis of bulk short - read RNA sequencing data was performed from neonatal 142 to aged C57BL / 6 mouse kidneys ( 8 - 10 mice per group spanning 0 to 79 weeks of life ) . The ratio 143 of intergenic to canonical reads was determined by their alignment to the canonical or intergenic 144 transcript within an inclusive 5 bp sliding window or stringent 10 bp fixed window around the splice 145 junction ( GRCm38 / mm10 chr1 : 170 , 318 , 737 - 170 , 318 , 738 ) ( Figure 1D , S3A - B ) . Analyzed reads 146 ranged from 5 - 16 per age group at this position out of 258 . 5 - 365 . 9 million aligned reads per age 147 group . Canonical reads were more frequent at 0 and 2 weeks of life ( 67 - 75 % ; Figure 1D - F , S3C ) . 148 In contrast , the intergenic reads were more frequent at 4 , 8 , and 79 weeks of life ( 60 - 80 % , Figure 149 1D - F , S3C ) , suggesting an age - dependent regulation of this splicing event . The higher prevalence 150 of intergenic reads was , furthermore , confirmed in an independent RNA sequencing dataset from 151 8 - week - old C57BL / 6 mice ( Figure S3D ) . 152 153 NOS1AP intergenic splicing was , similarly , observed at the identical orthogonal splice junction 154 ( GRCh37 chr1 : 162336994 - 162336995 ) in adult human kidney tissue by RT - PCR ( Figure 1G - H , 155 S2E ) . Of note , this transcript did not include optional 15 nucleotides adjacent to exon 4 that have 156 been detected in canonical human NOS1AP transcripts ( Figure S2E ) . To examine contiguous 157 NOS1AP transcripts in adult kidney or other tissues ( age of acquisition 40 to > 90 years ) , long read 158 sequencing from the ENCODE project was interrogated and demonstrated contiguous intergenic 159 All rights reserved .

For example , the 161 canonical NOS1AP transcript predominated across brain tissues ( 96 % ) while the ratio of 162 canonical to intergenic transcript was more variable in heart tissues ( 48 . 4 % ) ( Figure 1I , S4A - B ) . 163 164 As low read count in the single kidney sample from ENCODE only allowed for a qualitative 165 analysis , we next performed a quantitative evaluation of short - read RNA sequencing data from 166 human kidney samples in the NEPTUNE cohort ( living donor biopsy , nephrectomy , and NS patient 167 biopsy ) covering 244 samples of individuals from 2 to > 90 years . Quantifying reads that crossed 168 the human splice junction in a 10 bp fixed window , we found that qualifying reads corresponding 169 to the intergenic splice product predominated relative to canonical reads ( 69 . 6 - 93 . 8 % ) in all 170 sample groups within RNA isolated from either glomerular or tubular compartments ( Figure 1J , 171 S4C - D ) . 172 173 Finally , to assess if peptides corresponding to either canonical or intergenic isoforms are 174 abundant in glomerular podocytes , we re - analyzed proteomics data from FACS - sorted primary 175 mouse glomerular cells ( 29 ) . 23 unique peptides specific to either Nos1ap or Gm7694 were 176 identified , predominantly in podocytes ( Figure 1K - M , Supp . File S1 ) . Interestingly , no peptides 177 aligning to the unique C - terminus of canonical Nos1ap were identified , despite theoretical trypsin 178 cleavage sites yielding at least five detectable peptides of 7 to 25 amino acids in length 179 ( Document S2 ) . No peptides spanning the junction from Nos1ap to Gm7694 could be detected 180 either ( Document S2 ) . However , the only predicted digestion product including the Nos1ap - 181 Gm7694 junction site has a peptide length of 54 amino acids , precluding detection by mass 182 spectrometry ( Document S2 ) . In contrast , in proteomics data from adult mouse brain peptides 183 mapping to the unique C - terminus of canonical Nos1ap but not Gm7694 were detected ( Figure 184 1L , Supp . File S2 ) ( 30 ) . This analysis provides evidence for the existence of Gm7694 on a protein 185 level in glomerular podocytes . 186 187 Taken together , these observations indicate that the intergenic NOS1AP product is present in 188 human and mouse kidneys and may be regulated in an age - dependent fashion . 189 190 Variants impacting the Nos1ap locus cause murine podocytopathy . 191 All rights reserved .

These mice bear a homozygous deletion of the Nos1ap exon 3 , causing an in - frame 193 deletion within the N - terminal PTB domain ( Figure 2A , S1 ) . Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice developed 194 moderate albuminuria ( 1 - 3 g albumin / g creatinine ) accompanied by podocyte foot process 195 effacement at an ultrastructural level . Because we previously reported a limited number of human 196 subjects and mouse models ( 20 ) , we characterized two novel Nos1ap mouse models to further 197 establish the association between this locus and NS as well as to evaluate the biological relevance 198 of the intergenic product . 199 200 We first studied an additional mouse model , affecting both canonical and intergenic transcripts . 201 Nos1ap Ex4 - / Ex4 - mice bear a homozygous out - of - frame deletion in Nos1ap exon 4 , predicted to 202 cause early truncation within the PTB domain ( c . 271 _ 329del ; p . 91 _ 110delfs * 7 ) ( Figure 2A , S1 ) . 203 Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Nos1ap from wildtype and Nos1ap Ex4 - / Ex4 - embryonic 204 fibroblasts and neonatal mouse kidneys was performed using a polyclonal antibody raised against 205 the Nos1ap C - terminus ( Figure 2A - B , 2D ) . Immunoblotting for Nos1ap in the wildtype eluate 206 revealed multiple protein bands between 50 and 100 kDa , which were absent in the Nos1ap Ex4 - 207 / Ex4 - eluate ( Figures 2A , 2C ) . Consistent with orthologous isoforms identified in primary rat 208 neurons ( 23 , 26 ) and with mammalian kidney isoforms ( Figure 1 ) , the two most abundant bands 209 exhibited sizes consistent with the canonical Nos1ap protein ( ~ 70 kDa ) as well as an intergenic 210 Nos1ap - Gm7694 isoform ( ~ 100 kDa ) ( Figures 1A - C , 2A - B , 2D , S1 ) . Overall , this suggested the 211 Nos1ap Ex4 - allele causes total loss of Nos1ap protein expression in kidney tissue as expected . 212 213 Albuminuria was assessed in Nos1ap Ex4 - / Ex4 - mice between 4 - 12 months of age . Urine albumin - 214 to - creatinine ratios ( ACR ) were significantly elevated in homozygous mice relative to wildtype 215 controls at ages 7 - 9 months and 10 - 12 months ( median ACR 1227 mg / g creatinine versus 492 216 mg / g in controls at 10 - 12 months ) ( Figure 2E ) . Analysis of urine samples from 10 to 12 - month - 217 old mice by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining revealed albuminuria across all homozygotes 218 that was significantly elevated above the basal physiologic levels observed in control mice using 219 band densitometry and normalization to urine creatinine ( Figure 2F - G ) . Kidneys from 220 approximately 10 to 12 - month - old mice were evaluated for ultrastructural changes at the 221 glomerular filtration barrier by electron microscopy . Nos1ap Ex4 - / Ex4 - mouse kidney sections 222 exhibited reduced podocyte foot process density ( median 1 . 36 foot processes / µm versus 2 . 34 in 223 All rights reserved .

Overall , these observations supported that this recessive variant is 225 associated with a murine podocytopathy , consistent with our published observations in Nos1ap Ex3 - 226 / Ex3 - mice ( 20 , 31 ) . 227 228 Next , we investigated an allele that only affects the intergenic splice isoform but not the canonical 229 Nos1ap transcript . Specifically , we generated Gm7694 - / - mice , which bear a complete deletion of 230 predicted gene Gm7694 ( Figure 2A , S1 ) . Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Nos1ap from 231 embryonic fibroblasts showed selective loss of the intergenic but not canonical isoform in 232 Gm7694 - / - fibroblast eluates when immunoblotting with an antibody raised against rat Nos1ap C - 233 terminal regions of the canonical and intergenic proteins ( Figure 2A - B ) . Loss of the ~ 100 kDa 234 intergenic isoform was confirmed by immunoblotting of these lysates with an antibody raised 235 selectively against the rat intergenic Nos1ap isoform ( Figure 2A , 2C ) . This immunoblot also 236 revealed a potential cleavage product between 50 - 75 kDa that was also absent in Gm7694 - / - 237 eluates ( Figure 2C ) . 238 239 Albuminuria was assessed , showing significantly increased ACR levels in Gm7694 - / - mice relative 240 to controls between 4 - 6 months and 10 - 12 months ( Figure 2I ) ( median ACR 647 mg / g creatinine 241 in Gm7694 - / - mice versus 397 mg / g in controls at 10 - 12 months ) . Analysis of urine samples from 242 10 to 12 - month - old mice by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining similarly demonstrated 243 albuminuria in homozygotes , which showed modest but significantly elevated above basal levels 244 observed in control mice by densitometry and normalization to urine creatinine ( Figure 2J - K ) . 245 Kidneys from approximately 10 - to 12 - month - old mice were evaluated for ultrastructural changes 246 by electron microscopy . Similar to Nos1ap Ex4 - / Ex4 - mice , Gm7694 - / - mouse kidney sections 247 exhibited reduced podocyte foot process density ( median 1 . 47 foot processes / µm versus 2 . 16 in 248 controls ) and glomerular basement membrane thickening ( median 300 nm versus 234 nm in 249 controls ) ( Figure 2L ) . These findings suggest that Gm7694 and the intergenic Nos1ap splice 250 product play an important role in murine podocyte homeostasis and disease . 251 252 Novel C - terminal recessive variants in NOS1AP are associated with human SRNS . 253 We , previously , discovered that two recessive variants in NOS1AP cause early onset NS in 254 humans ( 20 ) . These variants were predicted to impact the N - terminal PTB domain of NOS1AP 255 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

To discover novel disease - causing recessive variants in NOS1AP or the 256 adjacent C1orf226 loci in humans , exome data generated after the initial study was interrogated 257 from an additional 985 families with NS . This revealed a rare , homozygous splice variant 258 ( NM _ 014697 : c . 1105 + 5G > C ) in NOS1AP in 1 family ( Table 1 ; Figure 3 , S1 ) . No competing 259 variants were detected in additional 60 nephrotic syndrome disease genes or 11 monogenic 260 nephritis disease genes ( 7 ) . The subject is male and of Middle East descent , born from a 261 consanguineous union . He developed edema during 0 - 5 years of age . Consistent with the clinical 262 diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome , his initial laboratory evaluation revealed microscopic hematuria , 263 nephrotic - range proteinuria ( 19 g protein / day ) , hypoalbuminemia ( 2 . 2 g / dL ) , reduced serum total 264 protein levels ( 4 g / dL ) , and elevated serum triglyceride levels ( 9 . 98 mmol / L ) . His proteinuria was 265 resistant to corticosteroids but partially responsive to the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine . 266 Sanger sequencing confirmed the variant was present homozygously in the proband and 267 heterozygously in unaffected parents and siblings , consistent with a recessive mode of 268 inheritance ( Figure 3 ) . The variant was predicted to strongly impair splicing of the penultimate 269 exon 9 by four independent algorithms ( Table 1 ; Figure S1 ) . Skipping of exon 9 is predicted to 270 create an out - of - frame deletion and loss of NOS1AP or NOS1AP - C1orf226 C - terminal domains 271 ( Figure S1 ) . Furthermore , the variant was absent from control genome databases ExAC and 272 gnomAD ( Table 1 ) . We , thus , concluded the recessive NOS1AP variant identified in this family is 273 deleterious and the likely cause of SRNS in this subject , highlighting the importance of the 274 NOS1AP C - terminus in human podocyte homeostasis . 275 276 In addition , we analyzed all NOS1AP or C1orf226 variants in the ClinVar genomic variation 277 database ( 32 ) for deleteriousness under the hypotheses that ( i ) recessive variants in these loci 278 are associated with nephrotic syndrome and ( ii ) variants were misclassified based on the 279 canonical transcript alone . Focusing on non - structural variants ( < 50 bp in size ) , we observed 67 280 reported variants , of which 14 variants were deemed deleterious based on rare prevalence and 281 predicted impact on protein coding or splice effect . Of these 14 variants , we previously published 282 two ( Figure S1 , Table 1 ) ( 20 ) . We were unable to obtain further clinical genetic data for three 283 novel variants . 8 additional variants were found in heterozygous states . A final variant was 284 observed in a subject ( Clin V ar family 2 ) , where detailed genotype and phenotype data was 285 available . Exome sequencing had been performed , identifying a homozygous variant in NOS1AP 286 exon 10 that was absent from the gnomAD database ( Table 1 ) .

G420A ) 288 with weak in silico prediction scores and , therefore , was not deemed deleterious . However , in 289 context of the alternative NOS1AP - C1orf226 transcript , the variant alters the + 1 position of the 290 intergenic splice site within NOS1AP exon 10 ( c . 1258 + 1G > C ) . Multiple prediction scores strongly 291 indicate impaired splicing and thus deleteriousness . Of note , no competing variants were 292 detected , including in > 71 genes associated with Mendelian genetic nephrotic syndrome and / or 293 nephritis ( 7 ) . Interestingly , reverse phenotyping of the subject revealed the most severe NS 294 phenotype , congenital nephrotic syndrome , which had later progressed to end - stage kidney 295 disease requiring dialysis . The subject had passed away within the age range of 0 - 5 years . He 296 also had a unilateral cystic kidney and healthy appearing contralateral kidney , a condition unlikely 297 to be responsible for his early onset kidney failure . This recessive NOS1AP variant highlights that 298 intergenic splicing of NOS1AP and C1orf226 is critical in human podocyte homeostasis and 299 corroborated our findings in mouse model studies ( Figure 2 ) . 300 301 Recessive Nos1ap variants cause severe albuminuria and kidney dysfunction on FVB / N 302 genetic background . 303 While we previously demonstrated that Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice on a C57BL / 6 background developed 304 proteinuric disease , these mice did not exhibit persistent hypoalbuminemia , kidney dysfunction 305 nor reduced survival ( 20 ) —features frequently observed in human SRNS . Moreover , the novel 306 mouse models described here similarly had modest albuminuria and normal survival into late 307 adulthood on C57Bl / 6 background ( Figure 2 ) . Because genetic background can modify the 308 severity of murine podocytopathies ( 33 – 35 ) , we posited that the kidney phenotype in C57BL / 6 - 309 Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - could be similarly affected by genetic background to faithfully recapitulate human 310 SRNS . 311 312 C57BL / 6 - Nos1ap Ex3 - / + mice were , thus , bred with FVB / N or 129 / sv mice for more than six 313 generations . This would yield Nos1ap Ex3 - / + mice with a genetic background reflecting > 98 % of the 314 outcrossed strain . Resulting FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / + or 129 / sv - Nos1ap Ex3 - / + were incrossed to yield 315 wildtype , heterozygote , and homozygote mice of the same background . FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - 316 mice developed albuminuria at weaning age with median ACR of 1 . 9 g / g , that increased to 13 . 8 - 317 15 . 7 g / g at 4 - 6 months of life ( Figure 4A ) . In contrast , ACR levels in 129 / sv - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice 318 were more modestly elevated relative to wildtype or heterozygote littermate controls ( 1 - 3 g / g 319 All rights reserved .

Overall , FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice exhibited 320 markedly elevated albuminuria relative to 129 / sv - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - and C57BL / 6 - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - 321 mice between 3 - 6 months of life ( Figure 4B ) , indicating the FVB / N background uniquely modifies 322 this kidney phenotype . 323 324 FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice were further analyzed for serum markers of nephrotic syndrome . In 325 association with marked albuminuria , FVB / N homozygous mice developed significantly reduced 326 serum albumin levels in serial measurements at 3 - 6 months of life relative to littermate controls 327 ( median albumin levels 3 . 0 - 3 . 5 g / dL versus 3 . 7 - 4 . 1 g / dL ) ( Figure 4C ) . Serum BUN levels , a 328 marker of declining kidney function , at 3 - 6 months were significantly elevated in FVB / N - 329 Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice relative to littermate controls ( median BUN levels 30 - 37 mg / dL versus 20 - 25 330 mg / dL ) ( Figure 4D , S5B ) . In correlation with reduced kidney function , homozygotes also exhibited 331 reduced survival between 6 - 8 months of life relative to control mice ( Figure 4E ) . Thus , in contrast 332 to C57BL / 6 - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice ( 20 ) , FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice develop persistent 333 hypoalbuminemia , kidney dysfunction , and increased mortality , faithfully recapitulating features of 334 human SRNS . 335 336 FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice exhibit histologic and ultrastructural features of a severe 337 podocytopathy . 338 Given the urinary and serum abnormalities in FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice , we hypothesized 339 homozygous mice develop glomerular changes consistent with a podocytopathy . Kidney tissue 340 sections from 6 - 8 months old mice were Periodic Acid Schiff ( PAS ) stained and analyzed by light 341 microscopy . Measurement of PAS - positive matrix within glomerular tufts revealed significantly 342 increased mesangial matrix deposition , indicative of chronic glomerular injury , in FVB / N - 343 Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice relative to heterozygote controls ( Figure 5A ) . Kidney tissue sections from 344 FVB / N homozygotes , furthermore , showed tubular dilation , reminiscent of human congenital 345 nephrotic syndrome ( 36 ) , in contrast to heterozygote controls ( Figure 5B ) . 346 347 Kidney sections were also examined by electron microscopy at weaning age ( 3 - 4 weeks of life ) 348 to assess early ultrastructural changes when albuminuria was first detected in FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - 349 / Ex3 - mice ( Figure 4A ) . Homozygotes exhibited podocyte foot process effacement and thickening 350 of the glomerular basement membrane ( GBM ) ( Figures 5C ) , relative to heterozygote glomeruli 351 All rights reserved .

Overall , 352 Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice exhibited biochemical and structural kidney abnormalities consistent with 353 human SRNS and modified by genetic background . 354 355 FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice respond to RAAS blockade . 356 RAAS blockade is an established treatment in human Alport syndrome caused by genetic variants 357 in the glomerular basement membrane related genes COL4A3 / 4 / 5 ( 37 ) . This treatment was 358 initially validated in genetic mouse models of Alport syndrome ( 38 ) . However , it remains unclear 359 if this clinical benefit extends to other monogenic forms of nephrotic syndrome . This includes 360 those caused by variants in podocyte - specific actin regulatory genes such as NOS1AP ( 10 , 19 , 361 20 , 39 – 42 ) . 362 363 To evaluate this hypothesis , FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice were treated at weaning age with oral 364 lisinopril . To assess the impact on proteinuria , urine ACRs were measured every two weeks for 365 14 weeks of treatment ( Figure 6A ) . FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice treated with 100 mg / L and 200 366 mg / L lisinopril exhibited significantly reduced albuminuria relative to vehicle treated animals 367 ( Figure 6A ) , indicating RAAS ameliorates the proteinuric phenotype in this model . 368 369 Serum markers were measured at early ( 4 - 8 weeks of treatment ) and late ( 12 - 16 weeks of 370 treatment ) time - points . Serum albumin and total protein were significantly elevated in 371 homozygous mice treated with 100 mg / L lisinopril relative to those receiving vehicle at the early 372 timepoint ( Figure S6A - B ) , correlating with the improvement in albuminuria ( Figure 6A ) . FVB / N - 373 Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice treated with 100 mg / L also showed reduced BUN levels relative to vehicle 374 treated animals at the late timepoint ( Figure S6C ) , indicating kidney dysfunction was blunted by 375 this ACE inhibitor dose . In contrast , FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice treated with 200 mg / L did not 376 have significantly different serum albumin , total protein , or BUN levels than vehicle treated - mice 377 ( Figure S6 ) . 378 379 Survival of FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice was monitored over 140 days of treatment . While only 20 % 380 ( 1 / 5 ) of vehicle - treated mice survived this time frame , all ( 11 / 11 ) of the homozygotes treated with 381 lisinopril survived ( Figure 6B ) .

Dynamin activating compound Bis - T - 23 reduced albuminuria and normalized podocyte 388 ultrastructural defects in multiple murine podocytopathies ( 46 ) . We hypothesized that Bis - T - 23 389 would , similarly , improve proteinuria in FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice . However , we did not observe 390 altered albuminuria with daily Bis - T - 23 treatment in 4 - week - old FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice 391 including when collecting urine 1 - 3 hours after treatment to assess for transient reduction in 392 albuminuria .

We , furthermore , demonstrate that genetic 398 background can modify the severity of this genetic podocytopathy ( Figure 4 - 5 ) , which resulted in 399 the generation of a more faithful model of human NS and suggested that variants in additional loci 400 can modify the nephrotic syndrome trait in mammals . Lastly , we provide evidence that in a mouse 401 model of NOS1AP - associated podocytopathy RAAS blockade is effective in reducing proteinuria 402 and preventing early mortality in this genetic form of nephrotic syndrome ( Figure 6 ) . 403 404 The novel NOS1AP alleles in humans and mice identified in this study ( Figures 2 - 3 , S1 ; Table 405 1 ) not only expand the genotype - phenotype correlation between this locus and NS but also 406 underscore the impact of C - terminal domains and alternative splice isoforms of NOS1AP / Nos1ap 407 in monogenic nephrotic syndrome . It does remain unclear if the canonical and intergenic isoforms 408 of NOS1AP play redundant or independent roles in podocyte biology . 409 410 The variant identified in ClinVar family2 was misclassified in the initial CLIA - certified result due 411 to interpretation based on the canonical transcript . This case underscores the importance of 412 tissue - and condition - specific isoform expression for correct variant interpretation , especially as 413 recent studies indicate that > 10 alternative transcripts exist for human coding genes while only an 414 average of 4 transcripts per gene are annotated ( 47 – 49 ) . 415 416 Our previous studies indicate that NOS1AP - dependent actin remodeling in podocytes is 417 independent of its neuronal binding partner NOS1 ( 20 ) . It remains possible that the canonical 418 NOS1AP protein , which is abundant in neonatal mouse kidney , may mediate its actin remodeling 419 effects through a key interaction partner other than NOS1 . In addition , our current findings lead 420 us to posit that NOS1AP may regulate podocyte homeostasis through interactions mediated by 421 the novel C - terminal domain created through the intergenic splice product . Future studies should 422 compare isoform - specific interaction partners and determine if in - frame deletion of the NOS1 - 423 binding domain causes a podocytopathy in mice . 424 425 Transcriptional and protein studies suggest predominance of the novel intergenic over the 426 All rights reserved .

Limitations remain regarding ( i ) 427 the relevance of the canonical isoform during kidney development and ( ii ) the prevalence of short 428 NOS1AP - C1orf226 transcripts not distinguished by short read RNA sequencing data . 429 430 Genetic background is , next , established to modify the phenotype of Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice and 431 thereby yields a more faithful model of steroid - resistant NS ( Figures 3 - 4 , S3 ) . In fact , the FVB / N - 432 Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice develop profound albuminuria , kidney dysfunction , and histologic kidney 433 damage reminiscent of human congenital nephrotic syndrome caused by genetic variants in 434 NPHS1 ( 36 ) . The increased susceptibility of the FVB / N mouse strain to glomerular injury in 435 genetic and acquired models of glomerular disease has been previously established ( 34 , 35 , 50 – 436 53 ) . Genome - wide association studies have been performed but revealed distinctly associated 437 loci depending on the kidney disease model ( 35 , 50 – 52 ) . It will be important in future studies to 438 identify loci specifically associated with modification of the Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - albuminuria and kidney 439 dysfunction traits , as these genetic factors could reveal modifying factors that mitigate or 440 aggravate the actin dysregulation caused by Nos1ap deficiency . 441 442 Treatments are limited in genetic forms of NS . RAAS blockade is widely employed in acquired 443 proteinuric diseases providing reduction of proteinuria and preservation of GFR ( 54 – 56 ) . Some 444 case reports and a recent metanalysis report proteinuria reduction from RAAS blockade in 445 children with genetic or primary SRNS / FSGS ( 57 – 61 ) . However , strong evidence for clinical or 446 experimental benefits in terms of preservation of renal function and reduction in mortality has only 447 been demonstrated for COL4A3 / 4 / 5 - variant associated Alport syndrome ( 37 , 38 ) . Our findings 448 that lisinopril ameliorates Nos1ap - associated podocytopathy in mice suggests that this benefit 449 extends to other Mendelian genetic pathways and should be considered in other forms caused by 450 variants in podocyte - specific actin regulatory genes ( 10 , 19 , 20 , 39 – 42 ) . 451 452 On the other hand , Bis - T - 23 did not alter the proteinuria in FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice despite the 453 related roles that NOS1AP and dynamin proteins play in actin - based filopodia formation ( 20 , 23 , 454 43 – 45 ) . It should be noted that there were , in fact , only modest transient effects of Bis - T - 23 on 455 proteinuria in a mouse model of ACTN4 - associated nephropathy ( 46 ) , indicating enhancing 456 Dynamin oligomerization may not be sufficient to restore normal podocyte physiology in some 457 forms of genetic NS . 458 All rights reserved .

The diagnosis of NS was based on clinical 471 features of nephrotic - range proteinuria , hypoalbuminemia , and edema and supported by kidney 472 biopsy findings evaluated by renal pathologists . Clinical data were obtained using a standardized 473 questionnaire ( http : / / www . renalgenes . org ) . 474 475 The Al - Hamed laboratory recruited subjects with informed consent for genetic studies under IRB - 476 approved research protocols RAC # 2160022 at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research 477 Centre ( KFSH & RC ) . 478 479 ES , and variant calling 480 Exome sequencing ( ES ) and variant calling were performed as previously described ( 7 , 62 ) to 481 discover a novel genetic cause of NS using Agilent SureSelect™ human exome capture arrays 482 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) with next generation sequencing ( NGS ) on an Illumina™ platform . 483 Sequence reads were mapped against the human reference genome ( NCBI build 37 / hg19 ) using 484 CLC Genomics Workbench ( version 6 . 5 . 1 ) ( CLC bio ) . Genetic location information is according 485 to the February 2009 Human Genome Browser data , hg19 assembly 486 ( http : / / www . genome . ucsc . edu ) . Downstream processing of aligned BAM files were done using 487 Picard and samtools , and SNV calling was done using GATK5 . Variant calling was performed as 488 previously described ( 7 , 62 ) . The variants included were rare in the population with mean allele 489 frequency < 1 % in dbSNP147 and with only 0 - 1 homozygotes in the adult genome database 490 gnomAD . Additionally , variants were non - synonymous and / or located within splice - sites . 491 Subsequently , variant severity were stratified based on protein impact ( truncating frameshift or 492 nonsense variants , essential or extended splice - site variants , and missense variants ) . Splice - site 493 variants were assessed by in silico tools MaxEnt , NNSPLICE , SpliceSite Finder , and GeneSplicer 494 splice - site variant prediction scores as well as conservation across human splice - sites as 495 All rights reserved .

Missense variants were assessed based on SIFT , MutationTaster , 496 PolyPhen 2 . 0 and CADD conservation prediction scores and evolutionary conservation based on 497 manually derived multiple sequence alignments . 498 499 ClinVar Database Query 500 The ClinVar Database ( 32 ) was queried for variants in NOS1AP and C1orf226 that were not large 501 structural variants . These variants were analyzed as above for rare population prevalence ( < 1 % 502 allele frequency ) and predicted deleterious effects on protein coding ( truncating variant or 503 missense variant with 2 + strong in silico prediction scores ) and / or splicing ( 2 + strong in silico 504 prediction scores ) . Variant submissions that were predicted to be deleterious were further 505 evaluated by contacting the designated submitter for additional genetic information ( zygosity , 506 method of detection and other detected variants ) and clinical information . The ClinVar s ubject 507 had CLIA exome sequencing performed ( 3Billion , South Korea ) with confirmed enrichment for 508 known NS - associated disease genes . 509 510 Mouse breeding and maintenance for Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice 511 The animal experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care 512 and Use Committee at the Boston Children ' s Hospital ( # 18 - 12 - 3826R ) . All mice were handled in 513 accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . Mice were housed 514 under pathogen - free conditions with a light period from 7 : 00 AM to 7 : 00 PM and had ad libitum 515 access to water and rodent chow . Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice were a kind gift from Dr . Norihiro Kato from 516 National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Japan . In brief , a linearized vector with targeted 517 deletion of Nos1ap Exon 3 was electroporated into ES cells , positive clones selected by G418 on 518 embryonic fibroblast feeder cells and targeted ES cells then microinjected into C57BL / 6 519 blastocysts . Resulting male chimeras were backcrossed onto C57BL / 6 mice and heterozygous 520 Nos1ap Ex3 - / + mice N4 generations were intercrossed to generate homozygous Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - 521 mice . Genotyping was performed by multiplex PCR using the following primers : 522 # 1 : CTTTGTCTTCTGCTTCGCC , # 2 : ACACTACCATTTGGTCTCC , # 3 : TCAAGACCGACCTGTCC and 523 # 4 : CAATAGCAGCCAGTCCC . 524 525 Mouse generation and maintenance of Nos1ap Ex4 - / E4 - and Gm7694 - / - 526 All rights reserved .

All mice were handled in accordance with the Canadian Council 528 on Animal Care ( CCAC ) . 529 530 Nos1ap Ex4 - / E4 - were generated as follows . Mice were ordered and generated at Baylor using the 531 KOMP Tm1a heterozygous knockout mice for gene Nos1ap ( MGI ID 1917979 , Knockout - First - 532 Reporter Tagged Insertion ( Promotor Driven Cassette ) ) . The Knockout - First Reporter Tagged 533 mice NOS1AP + / tm1a mice were then crossed with CMV - Cre mice from Jax labs ( B6 . CTg ( CMV - 534 Cre ) 1 Cgn / J ( Stock # 006054 ) ) to yield animals with complete excision of the neo cassette and 535 exon 4 but a residual LacZ reporter gene in the locus ( Nos1ap + / Ex4 - ) . PCR amplification of isolated 536 genomic DNA is used for genotyping using the following primers to detect the mutant allele 537 ( Nos1ap Ex4 - ) 5’ - CGGATAAACGGAACTGGAAA - 3’ and 5’ - TAATCACGACGCGCTGTATC - 3’ . For 538 the wild type allele the following primer sets are used 5’ - CAATTCATGGCAAGCAAAAC - 3’ and 5’ - 539 ATTTCTCTTCCTCCGCACCT - 3’ . See Genbank file https : / / www . i - 540 dcc . org / imits / targ _ rep / alleles / 26526 / escell - clone - genbank - file . Mice were maintained on a 541 C57BL / 6 background . They were in - crossed to generate wildtype , heterozygous and homozygous 542 mice . 543 544 Gm7694 - / - mice were generated by the Center for Mouse Genome Modification , University of 545 Connecticut Health Center . LoxP sites were placed around exons 1 and 2 of the Gm7694 gene 546 that undergoes intergenic splicing with Nos1ap . Mouse embryonic stem cells targeting Gm7694 547 were generated by blastocyst injection and tested for germline transmission . The resulting mosaic 548 mice were crossed with ROSA26 - Flpe mice to remove an internal neo cassette . To generate a 549 deleted allele ( Gm7694 - ) , the LoxP containing mice were crossed with the CMV - Cre mice from 550 Jackson . Loss of Gm7694 exons 1 and 2 were confirmed by PCR . The KO allele genotyping is 551 done with the following primers 5’ - GCCCCTCCTAATTCCAAGTG - 3’ and 5’ - 552 ACTGACCCAGCAAACCAACT - 3’ and the wild type allele is detected with the following primers 553 5’ - ATACGGGCCCTCTCTTAAC - 3’ and 5’ - ACTGACCCAGCAAACCAACT - 3’ . Gm7694 - / + mice 554 were in - crossed to generate wildtype , heterozygous and homozygous mice . Mice were 555 maintained on a C57BL / 6 background . 556 557 Urine analysis 558 All rights reserved .

Upon collection , samples were immediately frozen and stored at - 80 °C and only thawed 560 on ice prior to urine albumin and creatinine measurements once . Urinary albumin levels were 561 determined using the Albumin Blue Fluorescent Assay Kit ( Active Motif ) in combinations with 562 standard dilutions prepared from mouse serum albumin ( Equitech Bio Inc . ) . Urine creatinine was 563 measured using QuantiChrom™ Creatinine Assay Kit ( BioAssay Systems ) . In - gel protein 564 detection was performed with Coomassie blue dye . 565 566 Whole blood analysis 567 200 μl of blood were collected once a month via facial vein bleeding method and collected in 568 lithium heparin tubes . Blood samples were then immediately analyzed with the Vetscan ® VS2 569 Chemistry Analyzer using Comprehensive Diagnostic Profile rotors . 570 571 Histological analysis 572 The kidney tissues were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) , sectioned ( 5 μm thickness ) and 573 stained with periodic acid - Schiff ( PAS ) following standard protocols for histological examination . 574 For mesangial matrix deposition , 25 images ( at 40X magnification ) per animal were obtained to 575 detect glomerular tufts and stalk . Quantitative analysis of PAS - stained sections was performed in 576 a semiautomated manner using an ImageJ macro . Briefly , glomeruli were outlined manually and 577 cropped . Color splitting was performed to yield images of component colors that reflected the 578 PAS - positive extracellular matrix and nuclei or nuclei alone . Thresholding and particle analysis 579 were performed to determine the percent area in these channels to calculate the percent 580 glomerular area comprised of PAS - positive matrix . For tubular area , 5 images ( at 20X 581 magnification ) of the corticomedullary junction distributed across a longitudinal section of a kidney 582 section were obtained for each animal . Quantitative analysis of the tubular lumen area was 583 determined using a semiautomated ImageJ macro . Thresholding was performed on images to 584 detect open tubular lumen , and particular analysis was performed to calculate the percentage of 585 positive area . 586 587 Ultrastructural analysis 588 Kidney tissues were perfuse - fixed with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , 1 . 25 % PFA in 0 . 1 M sodium 589 cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) and then fixed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , 1 . 25 % PFA , and 0 . 03 % picric 590 All rights reserved .

Samples were embedded using the Poly / Bed 812 kit ( Polysciences ) 594 according to manufacturer’s instructions . After pure fresh resin embedding and polymerization in 595 a 65°C oven ( TD - 700 , DOSAKA , Japan ) for 24 h , sections of approximately 200 – 250 nm 596 thickness were cut and stained with toluidine blue for light microscopy . Sections of 70 - nm 597 thickness were double stained with 6 % uranyl acetate ( EMS , 22400 ) for 20 min and lead citrate 598 ( Fisher ) for 10 min for contrast staining . The sections were cut using Reichert Ultracut - S / LEICA 599 EM UC - 7 ( Leica ) with a diamond knife ( Diatome ) and transferred on to copper and nickel grids . 600 Sections were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy ( JEOL 1200EX ) at an acceleration 601 voltage of 80 kV . All steps , including image acquisition , were performed in a blinded manner by 602 independent persons . For each animal , ~ 21 images of 3 - 4 glomeruli were acquired for 603 assessment of podocyte foot process density and glomerular basement membrane thickness only 604 perpendicularly cut capillary loops evaluated . 605 606 Mouse Treatment Studies 607 For lisinopril studies , mice were treated with 100 or 200 mg / L of lisinopril ( Sigma , in their drinking 608 water as previously described ( 63 ) . Lisinopril or vehicle ( water ) containing drinking water was 609 changed three times weekly . Urine samples were collected every two weeks . Blood samples were 610 collected at an early and late timepoint in the study . Mice were monitored every 1 - 2 days for 611 survival for > 20 weeks of treatment . 612 613 For dynamin activating agent Bis - T - 23 ( Aberjona Labs ) , 20 or 30 mg / kg were administered daily 614 to mice by intraperitoneal injection as previously described ( 46 ) . First , urine was collected daily 615 from four - week - old FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice receiving Bis - T - 23 for seven days to detect 616 reduction in albuminuria prior to severe disease progression . In a second study , homozygotes 617 were treated daily , and urine samples were collected immediately prior to injection and hourly for 618 the subsequent three hours to detect transient changes in albuminuria . 619 620 RT - PCR Studies 621 All rights reserved .

Human kidney total RNA was purchased from Takara . The 631 sample was isolated from a post - mortem kidney sample from a n adult female who died 632 from sudden death unrelated to kidney disease . RNA was reverse transcribed using the iScript 633 cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Bio - Rad ) . cDNA was amplified using HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase and the 634 following primers : NEX1UTRtoATG _ F : CGGGTAACCATGCCTAGCAAAAC ; FL _ NOS1AP _ R2 : 635 ACCTACACGGCGATCTCATCATC ; FL _ FUSION _ NOS _ C1ORF _ R1 : 636 CTATTCAAAGGACAGCAGGTCTG . PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel 637 electrophoresis and subsequent Sanger sequencing . 638 639 Mouse Bulk RNA sequencing ( RNAseq ) re - analysis 640 50 bp single end reads sequenced from wildtype C57BL / 6J mice kidney samples at age 0 , 2 , 4 , 641 8 and 79 weeks were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) dataset GSE225622 642 ( 64 ) . 101 bp paired end reads sequenced from wildtype C57BL / 6J mouse kidney samples at 8 643 weeks of life were downloaded from dataset GSE145053 ( 65 ) . All samples for each time point 644 were pooled into a single dataset ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . We used trimmomatic v0 . 39 to trim 645 the low - quality next generation sequencing ( NGS ) reads ( - threads 20 ILLUMINACLIP : TruSeq3 - 646 PE . fa : 2 : 30 : 10 LEADING : 3 TRAILING : 3 SLIDINGWINDOW : 4 : 15 MINLEN : 36 ) ( 66 ) .

A ratio of intergenic to total 654 reads was computed where sum of all reads spanning the Nos1ap splice junction were taken as 655 the total . 656 657 Bulk Long Read RNAseq re - analyses from Human Tissues ( ENCODE ) 658 To verify that the intergenic transcript is expressed in human tissues , we interrogated long read 659 sequencing from the ENCODE project ( 69 ) . We downloaded 31 bam files from 1 kidney , 3 colon , 660 10 brain and 17 heart adult tissues sequenced using Pacific Biosciences Sequel technology 661 ( sample details in supplement table 2 ) . We visually inspected each bam file using the IGV browser 662 ( 70 ) . We , first , identified “long transcripts” which began before or within exon 3 of NOS1AP ( the 663 earliest exon where we found causative disease variants in human or mice ) . We , then , quantified 664 canonical transcripts , reads that extend into the UTR of NOS1A P exon 10 , and intergenic 665 transcripts that extend into the second coding exon of C1orf226 . To visualize the long - read 666 sequencing , we adapted the output from the alignment track in the IGV browser . For 667 representative examples , we selected the bam file from each tissue with the most intergenic 668 reads . For clarity of the figure and to emphasize the long reads , we filtered to reads aligned to the 669 positive strand and hid base - pair mismatches . 670 671 Bulk Short Read RNAseq re - analyses from Human Kidney Tissue ( NEPTUNE ) 672 To quantify the intergenic transcripts in human kidney tissues , we utilized micro - dissected 673 glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments from the NEPTUNE cohort , which included 674 patients with nephrotic syndrome as well as healthy tissue from tumor nephrectomies and living 675 donors ( 71 ) . Biopsies were prepared using the Clontech SMARTSeq v4 kit and sequenced using 676 Illumina HiSeq 2500 , resulting in 150bp unstranded , paired - end reads . For each sample , 677 individual reads were checked for adapter content , GC content , and per - base sequence quality 678 using FastQC . FastQ Screen was used to detect contamination of foreign or disproportionate 679 amounts of off - target RNA ( 72 ) . Sequenced reads were then aligned to the human reference 680 genome GRCh38 using STAR 2 . 5 . 2b and mapped reads were inspected for distribution across 681 introns , exons , UTR , and intergenic regions using picardtools ( 67 ) 682 ( http : / / broadinstitute . github . io / picard ) . We then used SAMtools to filter out duplicates , keep only 683 properly paired reads , and filter out reads with low mapping quality ( < 20 ) ( 73 ) . We filtered each 684 bam file to the start of NOS1AP and end of C1orf22 with a 1kb flank ( CRCh37 / hg19 685 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

The 150 bp reads were analyzed in exon 10 of NOS1AP that 686 either splice to C1orf266 or extend through exon 10 . To do this , we defined a 10 bp sequence for 687 each the canonical ( CTTAGGTAGG ) and intergenic ( CTTAGTTGAC ) transcripts , which ensured 688 at least 5 matched nucleotides before and after the splice site . For each bam file , we tabulated 689 both sequences . Reads that did not completely span either sequence were excluded . 690 691 Mouse kidney podocytes deep proteomics re - analysis 692 To assess if peptides corresponding to either canonical or intergenic Nos1ap isoforms are 693 abundant in mouse glomerular podocytes , deep proteomics data from Rinschen et al ( 29 ) was re - 694 analyzed . In brief , liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry was performed on FACS - 695 sorted podocytes and other glomerular cells from isolated mouse glomeruli . Cells were digested 696 using trypsin and , to increase peptide detection , six - layered SCX resin and fractionation using six 697 different buffers was performed . Proteomics raw data was downloaded from PRIDE 698 ( PXD003306 ) . Next , data was re - analyzed with MaxQuant ( v . 1 . 6 . 10 ) ( 74 ) using the Uniprot 699 SwissProt Mouse database ( downloaded in April 2021 ) amended by the sequences of non - 700 canonical intergenic Nos1ap , Gm7694 and the unique C - terminus of the canonical Nos1ap . In 701 total , 23 peptides were identified . 702 703 Nos1ap Immunoprecipitation from mouse fibroblasts 704 For immunoprecipitation assays , fibroblasts were lysed in NP40 lysis buffer ( 10 % glycerol , 1 % 705 NP - 40 , 137mM NaCL , 20mM Tris [ pH 8 . 0 ] containing 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) , 706 10ug / ml aprotinin , and 10 ug / ml leupeptin . Clarified neonatal kidney lysates were then precipitated 707 with an antibody raised against a region of canonical rat Nos1ap ( amino acids 304 - 503 ) that is 708 partially shared by intergenic Nos1ap ( amino acids 304 - 443 ) ( Antibody R300 , Santa Cruz sc - 709 9138 ) ( 23 , 26 ) . Clarified mouse embryonic fibroblasts were precipitated with an antibody raised 710 against a region of canonical rat Nos1ap ( amino acids 366 - 503 ) that is partially shared by 711 intergenic Nos1ap ( amino acids 366 - 443 ) ( Antibody 2093 ) ( 23 , 26 ) . Following an overnight 712 incubation at 4 C , Protein A Sepharose was added and incubated for 1 hour at 4 C . The 713 precipitated proteins were then washed 3 times in NP40 lysis buffer before the addition of 2 x 714 Sample Buffer . Protein samples were then resolved on 8 % or 10 % SDS - PAGE gels , transferred 715 to PVDF membrane ( EMD , Millipore , Billerica , MA ) and then blocked in 5 % skim milk in 1x TBST 716 for 1 hour .

Detection of alternative NOS1AP / Nos1ap transcripts in mice and humans . ( A ) Cartoon depicting the NOS1AP / Nos1ap genomic locus in humans / mice is shown ( left ) . Exons are indicated that contribute to the canonical and a non - canonical ( intergenic ) transcript . The latter results from intergenic splicing that joins 164 nucleotides from exon 10 of NOS1AP / Nos1ap to exons 1 and 2 of c1orf226 / Gm7694 . mRNA transcription and processing yield two potential transcripts ( canonical and intergenic ) seen in the middle diagram . Translation produces two potential protein products ( right ) containing the phospho - tyrosine binding ( PTB ) domain and , in the canonical protein , NOS1 PDZ binding domain ( L ) . Exons / protein regions coded in blue contribute to both canonical and intergenic transcripts / isoforms while exons / protein regions coded in green only contribute to the intergenic isoform . ( B ) Cartoon depicting the murine Nos1ap intergenic splice product is shown . Exons are indicated that arise from the canonical Nos1ap ( blue ) or adjacent Gm7694 ( green ) loci . The non - canonical transcript results from intergenic splicing that joins the first 153 nucleotides from exon 10 of Nos1ap to exons 1 and 2 of Gm7694 . An amplicon spanning from early Nos1ap into exon 2 of Gm7694 , which was identified by RT - PCR in adult mouse kidney total RNA . Aligned Sanger sequencing reads are shown below the transcript . ( C ) Sanger sequence reads of the PCR amplicon in ( A ) was aligned to the intergenic splice transcript , demonstrating a contiguous transcript from early exons in Nos1ap into Gm7694 exon 2 , including an in - frame 5’ UTR region of Gm7694 . ( D ) 50 bp reads ( red ) from short read RNA sequencing of mouse kidneys were aligned to the Nos1ap and adjacent Gm7694 loci . A greater fraction of canonical reads are shown extending through the intergenic splice junction in neonatal mouse kidney than in adult 8 week - old mouse kidney . ( E ) The ratio of canonical and intergenic reads in RNA sequencing data from 0 - , 2 - , 4 - , 8 - , and 79 - week - old mice are shown using a 5 bp sliding window approach . Reads ( n ) are shown above box plot . ( F ) The ratio of canonical and intergenic reads is shown as in ( E ) using a 10 bp fixed window approach . Reads ( n ) are shown above box plot . ( G ) Cartoon is shown depicting the human NOS1AP intergenic splice product . Exons are indicated that arise from the canonical NOS1AP ( blue ) or adjacent C1orf226 ( green ) loci . The non - canonical transcript results from intergenic splicing that joins the first 153 nucleotides from exon 10 of NOS1AP to exons 1 and 2 of C1orf226 . The lower image shows aligned Sanger sequencing reads spanning nearly the full - size amplicon ( 1943 bp ) , which was identified by RT - PCR from adult human kidney tissue . This product starts within the 5’ UTR of NOS1AP and ends close to the stop codon within exon 2 of C1orf226 . ( H ) Sanger sequencing plot resulting from the 1943 bp amplicon in ( G ) is shown demonstrating mRNA splicing between exon 10 of the canonical NOS1AP with the neighboring open reading frame C1orf226 , including an in - frame 5’ UTR region of C1orf226 .

Tissues ( t ) and reads ( r ) are noted above the box plot . ( J ) Violin plot displays percentage of NOS1AP transcripts reflecting canonical versus intergenic splice products for each glomeruli sample in NEPTUNE cohort short read RNA sequencing data . Samples had minimum of 5 reads at the intergenic splice junction in NOS1AP exon 10 .

Anti - proteinuric treatment reduces albuminuria and prevents mortality in FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice . ( A ) FVB / N - Nos1ap Ex3 - / Ex3 - mice with comparable baseline ACRs received drinking water with either vehicle ( water ) , 100 mg / L lisinopril , or 200 mg / L lisinopril starting at 6 weeks of age . Urine was collected biweekly and albumin as well as creatinine was quantified to determine albumin - to - creatinine ratios ( ACR ) as in Fig . 1 . In both treatment groups ( 100 mg / L lisinopril or 200 mg / L lisinopril ) albuminuria progression was significantly reduced by Kruskal - Wallis test ( p < 0 . 01 for vehicle versus 100 mg / L , p < 0 . 05 for vehicle versus 200 mg / L ) .
