Acid - induced release of stored ions from polyacrylic acid hydrogels ( with a free surface fully permeable to the ion and acid flux ) was observed to increase the gel osmotic pressure that leads to rapid , temporary swelling faster than the characteristic solvent absorption rate of the gel . Here we develop a continuum poroelastic theory that quantitatively explains the experiments by introducing a “gel diffusio - phoresis” mechanism : Steric repulsion between the gel polymers and released ions can induce a diffusio - osmotic solvent intake counteracted by the diffusio - phoretic expansion of the gel network . For applications ranging from drug delivery to soft robotics , engineering the gel diffusio - phoresis may enable stimuli - responsive hydrogels with amplified strain rates and power output . Osmosis , the diffusion of solvent in the direction of a steady solute concentration gradient across a semi - permeable membrane , underlies many biological pro - cesses ranging from turgor pressure regulation in walled cells for the development and mechanical stability of herbaceous plants to the separation of urea from water in the kidney [ 1 – 4 ] . Owing to the simplicity of osmosis and its capacity to convert modest concentration differences into significant pressures according to the van’t Hoff’s law , these examples have inspired various applications of chemomechanical energy conversion [ 5 – 12 ] . These also include the use of hydrogels , which are crosslinked poly - mer networks that imbibe a solvent and can expand up to a thousand times their dry weight . Capitalizing on large swelling , custom gel designs that can respond to exter - nal cues such as chemical , optical , magnetic stimuli , and humidity have enabled micron - scale proof - of - concept de - vices for soft robotic actuation , drug delivery , smart op - tical sensing , and synthetic homeostasis [ 13 – 23 ] . Despite the potential of hydrogels as bioinspired soft platforms , an inherent drawback is that a common gel with the shortest dimension H and permeability k f can deform only as fast as dictated by the rate of solvent absorption ( a . k . a . poroelastic diffusion ) at a timescale τ ∼ H 2 / k f . Thus , increasing the gel size drastically low - ers the strain rate and in turn the power output . A way to overcome this limitation is through the synthesis of hydrogels from a foam template with much bigger pores ( i . e . , higher k f ) than in most gels to achieve a strain rate of ∼ 0 . 2 s − 1 during the osmotic swelling of a centimeter - scale gel ( cf . ∼ 10 − 3 s − 1 in 100 µ m - wide NIPAAm and mm - sized polyacrylate gels ) with a power density com - parable to that of micron - sized gel beads [ 24 – 27 ] . How - ever , larger pore size inevitably reduces the density of the polymers , compromising on their degree of function - alization . This in turn restricts the gel responsiveness to ambient fields , which on the contrary must be preserved and ideally be combined with large strains and strain ∗ nadirkaplan @ vt . edu rates for effective chemomechanical energy transduction as a sought - after property of biomimetic soft matter . One chemically responsive system with a deformation rate that can exceed the poroelastic diffusion rate τ − 1 through a tunable transient osmotic imbalance is the widely used polyacrylic acid ( PAA ) hydrogel [ 28 ] . Un - der neutral or basic pH , the PAA gel can arrest divalent copper ions Cu 2 + ( or calcium ions Ca 2 + ) and contract with respect to its equilibrium height H by the formation of COO − − Cu 2 + − COO − chelates that remain kinetically stable over months without external Cu 2 + ( Fig . 1a ) [ 29 ] . When HCl is delivered as a second stimulus , the dissolved acid rapidly displaces Cu 2 + , releasing it to the fluid phase of the gel ( Fig . 1b ) . Although the formation of the stable carboxyl ( COOH ) groups this time in an acidic condi - tion favors gel contraction [ 30 , 31 ] , the gel temporarily overcomes these contractile stresses and swells by ∼ 10 % of H over the total copper decomplexation time τ total if τ total < τ ≡ H 2 / D ( D : poroelastic diffusion constant ; Table I ) . The swollen state is maintained until the Cu 2 + concentration equilibrates between the gel and the ini - tially copper - free supernatant domain . Eventually , the gel contracts to the height favored by the carboxyl groups ( Fig . 1c ) . As a control experiment , adding CuSO 4 into the HCl solution suppressed the swelling , implying a re - duction of the hypotonic character of the gel due to the temporary free copper gradient in the first place [ 28 ] . In this Letter , we theoretically address the following problem motivated by these experiments : Since osmosis is always associated with a degree of interface selectiv - ity to a solute , how does osmotic pressure build up and then diminish across the gel - supernatant interface , which is fully permeable to the ions and acid ? To that end , we hypothesize that osmosis can rather be manifested as a bulk effect in the gel : If the proton - doped polymer net - work and the free ions interact at the microscopic scale , the aqueous solution must undergo diffusio - osmotic flow due to the ion concentration gradient , inducing a diffusio - phoretic displacement of the polymers in the opposite di - rection akin to the diffusio - phoresis of colloidal particles in a background solution [ 32 ] . To test this hypothesis , we develop a linear poroelastic theory for diffusio - phoretic a r X i v : 2 3 09 . 05165v1 [ c ond - m a t . s o f t ] 10 S e p 2023 2 FIG . 1 . PAA gel response to two competing stim - uli . ( a ) Acid ( red , volume fraction ϕ ( a ) + ) is delivered from the supernatant solution into a copper - laden PAA hydro - gel ( attached to a substrate ) with a contracted initial height h ( 0 ) < H due to the stable complexation between the COO − groups and bound Cu 2 + ( blue , volume fraction ϕ ( b ) ) , which turns the gel to blue . ( b ) When the complexation of acid with a volume fraction ϕ ( b ) + forms COOH groups , Cu 2 + ions are re - leased , acquiring a volume fraction ϕ ( 0 ) in the gel solution . The gel swells with a time - dependent height h ( t ) > h ( 0 ) and loses the blue color while a ϕ ( 0 ) gradient along the z − axis emerges ( right ) [ 28 ] . ( c ) This gradient eventually vanishes due to Cu 2 + diffusion , and the gel relaxes to the final height h ( ∞ ) ≈ h ( 0 ) favored by the COOH - induced contraction . gel swelling caused by the repulsive interactions between the polymer and ions . To our knowledge , gel diffusio - phoresis has not been conceptualized experimentally or theoretically before . In fact , although polyacrylate and polyacrylamide hydrogels can transiently swell or shrink in response to the osmolarity of a solution with osmolytes as heavy as 20 – 200 kDa , this was reported to be due to the suppression of the osmolyte diffusion by the gel net - work [ 27 , 33 – 35 ] . Moreover , a thin - film theory that we developed for the ion - release induced traveling deforma - tion waves along PAA gel films was agnostic to the per - meability of the gel - supernatant interface ( since it cannot resolve the through - thickness pressure and concentration gradients ) and thus assumed a temporary osmotic imbal - ance of the ions based on van’t Hoff’s law [ 28 ] . Here we show that , when adding strong acid , the gradient of the released copper ions upon acid complexation in the gel re - sults in a rapid diffusio - phoretic swelling burst with a rate τ − 1 total bigger than the poroelastic deformation rate τ − 1 , in quantitative agreement with experiments . For suffi - ciently weak acid , swelling is suppressed ( τ − 1 total ≲ τ − 1 ) . Accordingly , our theory confirms without free parameters that free agents with a much smaller molecular weight ( ≲ 100 Da ) than typical osmolytes can induce diffusio - osmotic stress in the gel and deform it in the absence of impeded diffusion or interface selectivity . Importantly , the inequality D DP ≫ D ( D DP : diffusio - phoretic mobil - ity ; Table I ) could be leveraged by large deformations of the PAA gel and also be engineered in other gels as such to scale up chemically responsive shape - shifting hydrogel actuators with high strain rates and power densities . We formulate the gel mechanics via a minimal Biot consolidation model [ 36 , 37 ] . Defining v as the fluid ve - locity relative to the solid matrix , u as the matrix dis - placement vector , and p as the solution pressure , the mass and momentum conservation of the gel fluid are respectively given by the incompressibility condition and the Darcy’s law for porous flow , i . e . ( µ f : solution kine - matic viscosity ; Table I ) , ∇ · (cid:18) v + ∂ u ∂t (cid:19) = 0 , v = − k f µ f ∇ p . ( 1 ) Eq . 1 yields the fluid variables p , v when u or equiv - alently the linear elastic gel strain tensor ϵ ≡ ( ∇ u + ( ∇ u ) T ) / 2 is determined from the mechanical equilibrium condition for the gel stress tensor σ ∇ · σ = 0 . ( 2 ) In σ , the linear poroelastic terms comprise the elastic stresses ( µ , λ : Lam´e coefficients ; Table I ) and the solu - tion pressure p . We add to these two chemical contractil - ity terms associated with the bound copper volume frac - tion ϕ ( b ) and bound acid volume fraction ϕ ( b ) + on the gel polymers as in Ref . [ 28 ] ( ˜ γ , ˜ χ : stress prefactors ; Table I ) , the osmotic pressure induced by the polymer volume frac - tion ϕ p , and the diffusio - osmotic stress term due to the interstitial free copper volume fraction ϕ ( 0 ) ( I : rank - two identity tensor , k B : Boltzmann’s constant , T : temper - ature , v c : effective molecular volume ; Table I ) : σ = 2 µ ϵ + I h λ Tr ( ϵ ) − p + ˜ γϕ ( b ) + ˜ χϕ ( b ) + − k B T v c (cid:18) η DP ϕ ( 0 ) + ϕ 2 p 2 (cid:19)i . ( 3 ) The dimensionless diffusio - phoretic coefficient satisfies η DP > 0 ( η DP < 0 ) for repulsive ( attractive ) interac - tions between the polymer and the free copper , imposing a diffusio - osmotic flow of the solution towards higher in - teraction energy densities proportional to ϕ ( 0 ) similar to Marangoni flows [ 32 ] . Then , the gel network will un - dergo diffusio - phoretic displacement in the opposite di - rection to negate the diffusio - osmotic flow . Here , we con - sider purely steric repulsions between the polymer and the Cu 2 + ions with an exclusion radius R e , which leads to η DP ≡ R 2 e / k f > 0 and in turn gel swelling when the free copper gradient is in the − ˆz direction . The diffusio - phoretic mobility coefficient D DP is given in terms of the parameters in Eq . 1 and Eq . 3 as D DP ≡ k B TR 2 e / v c µ f ( Table I ) . We ignore an analogous diffusio - osmotic con - tribution of the acid since it equilibrates across the two domains much faster than the timescales of interest in this work . As with polymer solutions , the osmotic pres - sure quadratic in ϕ p imposes a permanent stress in the gel due to the cross - linked polymers , for which the gel - supernatant interface is effectively impermeable [ 38 , 39 ] . This osmotic stress is predominantly interfacial because of the polymer concentration discontinuity across the 3 gel boundary . Because the free - copper - induced diffusio - osmotic stress with a linear term in ϕ ( 0 ) in general dom - inates the polymeric osmotic stress quadratic in ϕ p , the capability of controlled ionic release from the PAA gel can enable very high strain and strain rates compared to the gel swelling via mere osmotic solvent absorption . The implicit time dependence of the stress tensor ( Eq . 3 ) is governed by the advection and diffusion of the free copper volume fraction ϕ ( 0 ) and the free acid vol - ume fraction ϕ ( 0 ) + in the gel , as well as their conversion rates to / from the bound states ϕ ( b ) , ϕ ( b ) + on the gel back - bone . The solvent volume fraction ϕ s and ϕ p , ϕ ( 0 ) , ϕ ( 0 ) + satisfy ϕ s + ϕ p + ϕ ( 0 ) + ϕ ( 0 ) + = 1 . Our model captures the evolution of ϕ ( 0 ) and ϕ ( 0 ) + through the reaction - transport equations ( D x : diffusion constant of species x , ˜ r : rate constant , ϕ ∗ : COO − volume fraction ; Table I ) ∂ϕ ( 0 ) ∂t + ∇· ≡ Q Cu z } | { (cid:20) ϕ ( 0 ) (cid:18) v + ∂ u ∂t (cid:19) − D Cu ∇ ϕ ( 0 ) (cid:21) = ˜ rϕ ( 0 ) + ϕ ( b ) − ˜ rϕ ( 0 ) h ϕ ∗ − 2 ϕ ( b ) − ϕ ( b ) + i | { z } ≡ R Cu , ( 4 ) ∂ϕ ( 0 ) + ∂t + ∇· ≡ Q + z } | { (cid:20) ϕ ( 0 ) + (cid:18) v + ∂ u ∂t (cid:19) − D + ∇ ϕ ( 0 ) + (cid:21) = − ˜ rϕ ( 0 ) + ( ϕ ∗ − ϕ ( b ) + ) | { z } ≡ R + , ( 5 ) and the evolution of ϕ ( b ) , ϕ ( b ) + through the rate equations ∂ϕ ( b ) ∂t = − R Cu , ∂ϕ ( b ) + ∂t = R + . ( 6 ) We assume a single rate constant ˜ r for all reactions in Eqs . 4 – 6 since they must occur at comparable timescales . The first term of R Cu describes the acid - induced Cu 2 + decomplexation from the gel backbone , and the second term is the formation rate of a COO − − Cu 2 + − COO − chelate , hence the factor 2 . The source term R + is the COOH formation rate . With the impermeability condition at the gel - substrate interface , Eqs . 1 – 6 fully determine the time - dependent flow , chemical coupling , and deformations within the gel domain , provided that the flow of the supernatant solu - tion is specified to impose flux , stress , and concentration continuity at the gel free surface . In the supernatant do - main , denoting the fluid velocity by V , the fluid stress tensor by σ ( a ) , and the pressure by P , the incompress - ibility condition and the Stokes flow are given by ∇ · V = 0 , ∇ · σ ( a ) = 0 ; σ ( a ) = µ f ∇ V − I P . ( 7 ) Unlike in the gel , the copper ions with a volume fraction ϕ ( a ) and acid with a volume fraction ϕ ( a ) + in the super - natant domain merely undergo advection and diffusion , given by the mass conservation equations ( D ( a ) x : diffu - sion constant of species x in the supernatant ; Table I ) ∂ϕ ( a ) ∂t + ∇ · ≡ Q ( a ) Cu z } | { h ϕ ( a ) V − D ( a ) Cu ∇ ϕ ( a ) i = 0 , ( 8 ) ∂ϕ ( a ) + ∂t + ∇ · ≡ Q ( a ) + z } | { h ϕ ( a ) + V − D ( a ) + ∇ ϕ ( a ) + i = 0 . ( 9 ) Next , we determine the boundary conditions . Eqs . 1 – 6 constitute a set of nonlinear differential equations eighth order in space and fifth order in time for the gel variables f ≡ { p , v , u , ϕ ( 0 ) , ϕ ( 0 ) + , ϕ ( b ) , ϕ ( b ) + } . They are coupled to Eqs . 7 – 9 for the supernatant domain variables f ( a ) ≡ { P , V , ϕ ( a ) , ϕ ( a ) + } , which are seventh order in space and second order in time , through the continuity conditions between the two domains , given by ( ˆn : unit normal vector of the gel surface ) z = H : V = v + ∂ u ∂t , P − p = k B T v c (cid:0) η DP ϕ ( 0 ) + ϕ 2 p 2 (cid:1) , ˆn · σ = ˆn · σ ( a ) , ˆn · Q Cu = ˆn · Q ( a ) Cu , ˆn · Q + = ˆn · Q ( a ) + , ϕ ( 0 ) = ϕ ( a ) , ϕ ( 0 ) + = ϕ ( a ) + . ( 10 ) Here , the interfacial pressure jump between P and p mer - its discussion : When copper and acid are absent , the pressure difference is set by the polymer - induced gel os - motic stress that relaxes the gel to its equilibrium state , which we take as the reference state with zero strain . Adding a diffusio - osmotic agent such as copper will alter the solution pressure in the gel , and the pressure across the interface must equilibrate instantaneously [ 39 , 40 ] , leading to the second condition in Eq . 10 . The boundary conditions for the gel attached to an impermeable and rigid substrate at z = 0 and for the impermeable super - natant domain boundary at z = H + H ( a ) are given by ( H ( a ) : supernatant domain height ; Table I ) z = 0 : ˆn · v = 0 , u = 0 , ˆn · Q Cu = 0 , ˆn · Q + = 0 , ( 11 ) z = H + H ( a ) : V = 0 , P = 0 , ˆn · Q ( a ) Cu = 0 , ˆn · Q ( a ) + = 0 . ( 12 ) To explain the vertical deformation dynamics in Ref . [ 28 ] , we consider first , 1D uniaxial deformations in response to a uniform acid front advancing in the − ˆz direction to the copper - laden gel and , second , 2D defor - mations due to an acid front with a Gaussian weak per - turbation to investigate the effect of the potential nonuni - formities during initial acid delivery in the experiments . In the linear elastic limit , we take the polymer volume 4 fraction ϕ p and the COOH volume fraction ϕ ∗ constant by ignoring the effect of small deformations on the con - centrations ( Table I ) . In 1D , we denote the magnitudes of all the vector variables , which are along the ± ˆz direction , by u z ( z , t ) ≡ | u | , v ( z , t ) ≡ | v | , V ( z , t ) ≡ | V | . All non - vanishing tensors have a single scalar component , i . e . , σ zz ≡ ˆz · σ · ˆz , ˆz · ϵ · ˆz = ∂u z / ∂z , and ˆz · I · ˆz = 1 . When the initial conditions for u z , ϕ ( 0 ) , ϕ ( 0 ) + , ϕ ( b ) , ϕ ( b ) + , ϕ ( a ) , ϕ ( a ) + are given , Eqs . 1 – 12 determine the uniaxial deformations as follows : Per Eqs . 10 – 12 , the incompressibility condi - tions in Eqs . 1 , 7 reduce to v + ∂u z / ∂t = 0 and V = 0 , i . e . , local gel deformations do not impose any net flow in the lab frame . This also leads to a diffusive stimulus dynamics in Eqs . 4 , 5 , 8 , and 9 . Then , using the unitless variables u ′ z ≡ u z / H , z ′ ≡ z / H ( gel ) , z ′ ≡ z / H ( a ) ( su - pernatant ) , t ′ ≡ t / τ where τ ≡ µ f H 2 / k f ¯ p , ¯ p ≡ ( 2 µ + λ ) , and dropping their primes , Eqs . 1 – 3 yield a dimensionless evolution equation for the gel displacement dynamics as ( γ ≡ ˜ γ / ¯ p , χ ≡ ˜ χ / ¯ p , ν DP ≡ k B Tη DP / v c ¯ p ; Table I ) ∂u z ∂t = ∂ 2 u z ∂z 2 + γ ∂ϕ ( b ) ∂z + χ∂ϕ ( b ) + ∂z − ν DP ∂ϕ ( 0 ) ∂z ( 13 ) with the boundary conditions from Eqs . 10 , 11 ( ˆn = ˆz ) u z (cid:12)(cid:12) z = 0 = 0 , ∂u z ∂z (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) z = 1 = − γϕ ( b ) − χϕ ( b ) + . ( 14 ) Eqs . 13 , 14 are closed by the unitless forms of Eqs . 4 – 6 , 8 , 9 ( i . e . , Eqs . S1 - S5 ) and the corresponding boundary conditions in Eqs . 10 – 12 with the unitless parameters de - fined in Table I ( Sec . S1 ) [ 41 ] . The seven initial conditions for the contracted gel with stored Cu 2 + are u z = − γϕ ( b ) z , ϕ ( b ) = ϕ ∗ 2 , ϕ ( b ) + = ϕ ( 0 ) = ϕ ( 0 ) + = 0 , ( 15a ) and in the supernatant solution ϕ ( a ) = 0 , ϕ ( a ) + ( z ) = ϕ ( a ) + , i 2 [ 1 + tanh ( Γ ( z − z 0 ) ) ] , ( 15b ) where Γ = Γ ( 1D ) and z 0 = z ( 1D ) 0 are given in Table I . In 2D , by making the horizontal coordinate x unitless with the domain length L , we complement the unitless forms of Eqs . 1 – 12 with periodic boundary conditions at x = 0 and x = 1 for f , f ( a ) , σ , σ ( a ) , and all flux terms . Eqs . 15a , 15b again hold with Γ = Γ ( 2D ) and z 0 = z ( 2D ) 0 , which is given by a Gaussian profile , as well as with an additional initial condition for horizontal deformations u x ≡ u · ˆx = 0 , z ( 2D ) 0 = h 1 − h 2 e − ( x − 1 / 2 ) 2 2 λ 2 . ( 16 ) Here h 2 is obtained from the initial supernatant acid amount constraint ϕ ( a ) + , i ( 1 − z ( 1D ) 0 ) when h 1 is fixed , and λ sets a perturbation width about the capillary length of water ℓ c ∼ 1 mm ( see Fig . 3a for the initial acid profile ) . The values of h 1 , h 2 , λ , and Γ ( 2D ) are given in Table I . To compare our simulations for a 1D uniform acid front and weakly perturbed 2D acid front with experiments , we used the uniform acid delivery and uniaxial deformation data illustrated in Fig . 3 of Ref . [ 28 ] . The experimen - tal gel height h ( t ) and the total cross - sectional bound copper in the gel ϕ ( b ) total ( t ) are post - processed as detailed in Sec . S2 [ 41 ] . For uniaxial deformations , we solved Eqs . 13 – 15b and Eqs . S1 - S5 by using the FEniCS finite element analysis ( FEA ) library on Python 3 . 9 [ 41 , 42 ] . For weakly perturbed 2D dynamics , we solved Eqs . 1 – 12 , 15a – 16 with periodic boundary conditions along the x − axis via the COMSOL Multiphysics 5 . 4 FEA pack - age [ 43 ] . The two FEA libraries yield the same result for uniform deformations ( Fig . S1 ) [ 41 ] . All characteristic physical scales of the system and the unitless simulation parameters are listed in Table I . FIG . 2 . Gel deformations upon adding strong or weak acid . The unitless gel height h / H ≡ 1 + u z versus time for ( a ) ϕ ( a ) + , i = 0 . 006 ( equivalent to ∼ 1M acid ) and ( c ) the step - wise addition of acid with ϕ ( a ) + , i = 6 × 10 − 5 ( ∼ 0 . 01M ) initially and ϕ ( a ) + , i = 3 × 10 − 4 ( ∼ 0 . 05M ) at t / τ = 8 . 4 , respectively ( see Eq . 15b ) . For the 2D simulations , the hydrogel height is cal - culated by averaging over the experimental distance between two adjacent microplates ( = 5 µm ) about the horizontal cen - ter of the gel film ( x / L = 0 . 5 ± 1 × 10 − 4 ) . ( b ) , ( d ) Time dependence of the total bound copper ϕ ( b ) total ≡ R 1 0 ϕ ( b ) dz cor - responding , respectively , to ( a ) and ( c ) . In 2D , ϕ ( b ) total is aver - aged over x / L = 0 . 5 ± 1 × 10 − 4 as with the gel height . Our main results are demonstrated in Fig . 2 . Upon the diffusion of 1 M acid ( ϕ ( a ) + , i = 0 . 006 ) into the copper - laden gel from the supernatant domain , the gel height ex - hibits a temporal spike with a magnitude about ≲ 10 % of the equilibrium height H in quantitative agreement with the experiments ( Fig . 2a ) . This rapid swelling followed by the relatively slower contraction can be understood by considering the interplay among the flux of acid and its complexation with the gel , the subsequent release of bound copper and the diffusio - phoretic solvent inflow in - duced by it , and the poroelastic gel relaxation at longer times ( Fig . S2 - S4 ) [ 41 ] : Although our theory suggests that diffusio - phoresis can induce rapid gel deformations 5 FIG . 3 . Gel response to a 2D acid stimulus . ( a ) For the addition of 1M acid with a Gaussian perturbation ( Eqs . 15b , 16 ) , the gel dynamics at ( b ) t = 0 . 1 τ , ( c ) t = 0 . 3 τ , ( d ) t = 0 . 5 τ and ( e ) t = 0 . 7 τ within the boxed region shown in ( a ) . ( f ) Upon adding 0 . 05M acid with a perturbed front at t = 8 . 4 τ , the gel dynamics at ( g ) t = 8 . 5 τ , ( h ) t = 9 . 2 τ , ( i ) t = 16 τ and ( j ) t = 24 τ within the boxed region shown in ( f ) . The red streamlines indicate the computed fluid flow in the lab frame ( line width : logarithm of the flow speed , arrows : flow direction ) . The blue color scale indicates the volume fraction of the bound copper , and α = 770 ( Table I ) . at a timescale τ / ν DP ≪ τ , the swelling rate is limited by the overall release time τ total ≈ 0 . 82 τ of the height - averaged bound copper ϕ ( b ) total ( Fig . 2b ) . As a result , the gel undergoes continual diffusio - phoretic swelling until t ≈ τ total when the height reaches maximum ( Fig . 2a ) . This swelling time is still faster than τ and can po - tentially be improved by considering nonlinear deforma - tions driven by higher acid concentrations . Throughout swelling and subsequent relaxation , because the bound copper is instantaneously replaced by the acid on the gel backbone ( r ≫ 1 , Table I ) , the combination of the sec - ond and third terms on the right - hand side of Eq . 13 is negligible , and the flux condition in Eq . 14 is nearly con - stant ( Fig . S5 ) [ 41 ] . Therefore , the decay from the maxi - mum height is governed by the competition between the diffusive relaxation of the deformations and the residual diffusio - phoretic swelling . This leads to a subdiffusive re - laxation dynamics with a timescale τ r , 1 ≈ 0 . 54 τ , which is higher than the timescale τ D ≡ 4 τ / π 2 ≈ 0 . 4 τ of the purely diffusive relaxation dynamics at the leading order ( Sec . S3 , Fig . S6 ) [ 41 ] . The diffusive contribution ceases at t ≳ 4 τ , and the longtime slow relaxation is henceforth governed by the ever damping diffusio - phoretic term with a timescale τ r , 2 ≈ 5 . 2 τ ( Fig . S6 ) [ 41 ] . To validate that the swelling response in Fig . 2a is driven by the rapid release of the Cu 2 + ions , the same acid amount was slowly added over successive steps with concentrations ranging from 0 . 01 M to 1 M , which lead to no deformation ( Fig . 2c , circles ) [ 28 ] . Here we simu - late only the first two steps of acid addition with ϕ ( a ) + , i = 6 × 10 − 5 ( ∼ 0 . 01M ) at t = 0 and ϕ ( a ) + , i = 3 × 10 − 4 ( ∼ 0 . 05M ) at t = 8 . 4 τ . Our numerical results yield marginal defor - mations about 0 . 1 % and 0 . 5 % of the equilibrium height H that fall within the experimental error of ± 1 % H ( Fig . 2c ) . Swelling is suppressed for the low acid concen - trations since the bound Cu 2 + release rate is drastically reduced ( Fig . 2d ) . In this limit , the gel poroelastic re - laxation can balance the diffusio - phoretic swelling that is slowed down by the low bound Cu 2 + release rate . Con - sequently , both rate terms in Eq . 13 are at play , and our numerical analysis reveals that the relaxation of the minute deformations is always subdiffusive ( Fig . S6 ) [ 41 ] . Although the 2D weakly perturbed gel swelling and bound copper release profiles deviate only slightly from the 1D uniaxial deformation results ( Fig . 2a – d , blue curves ) , the 2D simulations reveal the nature of the sur - face deformation dynamics during the swelling and relax - ation stages . Fig . 3 and the Movies S1 , S2 demonstrate the hydrogel deformations , the accompanying fluid flow in the gel and the supernatant , and the bound copper as a function of time when adding 1M acid initially ( Fig . 3a – e , Movie S1 ) and 0 . 05 M acid delivery at t = 8 . 4 τ after the initial 0 . 01M acid addition step ( Fig . 3f – j , Movie S2 ) [ 41 ] . For strong acid , the penetration of the Gaussian stimu - lus front into the gel triggers a local swelling bump as - sociated with a convective flow ( Fig . 3b – c ) . Later , the flow reverses direction at the center ( x = L / 2 ) at the 6 TABLE I . Simulation parameters . The parameters denoted by ( ∗ ) correspond to the experimental values in Ref . [ 28 ] . For the parameters labeled by ( † ) , the acid diffusivities were assumed D + = D ( a ) + ≈ 3 × 10 − 8 m 2 / s within the experimental range given in Refs . [ 44 , 45 ] , the copper diffusivities were taken from Ref . [ 46 ] as D Cu ≈ 6 × 10 − 10 m 2 / s and D ( a ) Cu ≈ 10 − 9 m 2 / s assuming that the Cu 2 + diffusion in the gel must be slower than in the supernatant due to the polymer presence . The diffusio - phoretic mobility is estimated as D DP = k B TR 2 e / v c µ f for steric repulsions between the polymer and the Cu 2 + ions with an exclusion radius R e = 3 × 10 − 10 m , equivalent to η DP = R 2 e / k f = 0 . 225 ( Eq . 3 ) [ 32 ] . The pressure scale ¯ p is estimated from Refs . [ 47 – 50 ] . The parameters denoted by ( ‡ ) are chosen to model an acid signal front as a step function in 1D , which is weakly perturbed with a Gaussian profile along the x − axis in 2D ( Eq . 16 ) . The value of Γ ( 2D ) approximates the built - in step function in Comsol per Eq . 15b [ 43 ] . The standard deviation λ ensures that the width of the non - uniformity is comparable to the water capillary length ℓ c ≈ 10 − 3 m . Among the parameters not labeled by a superscript , k f , ¯ p and r are chosen in physically plausible ranges , whereas the low aspect ratio δ ≪ 1 models the gel as a thin film . The chemical stress moduli γ and χ are found by fitting the experimental gel height of a copper - laden ( t = 0 ) and fully acid - complexed ( t → ∞ ) gel film , respectively ( Sec . S2 ) [ 41 ] .

Similar traveling deformation fronts sensitive to the acid progression rate and direction along the substrate were reported in Ref . [ 28 ] . Note that the swelling fronts are not solitons since , upon passing through each other , two such waves would end up in bound - copper - depleted re - gions and thus rapidly be annihilated . For weak acid , because the deformation and flow are negligible , a trav - eling front at the gel surface does not form ( Fig . 3g – j ) . By introducing diffusio - phoretic mobility to account for the change in the PAA gel hypotonicity , our theory quantitatively captures the fast swelling dynamics due to the interplay between the copper and acid . This core non - equilibrium mechanism also underlies the swelling response when the copper ion is replaced by the calcium ion , an ubiquitous signal mediator in biology [ 28 , 51 , 52 ] . Thus , the generic reaction - transport pathways herein may enable adaptive and agile biomimetic soft actua - tors driven by gel diffusio - phoresis , which nevertheless requires further studies : First , it needs to be validated by microscopic approaches such as molecular dynamics simulations . Second , the linear poroelastic swelling in Fig . 2a only produces a strain rate of ∼ 0 . 04 s − 1 and a power density of ∼ 11 . 1 mW / kg ( Sec . S4 , Fig . S7 ) , which are surpassed by certain porous gels that generate 0 . 2 s − 1 and 260 mW / kg and PAA microgel suspensions that achieve 230 mW / kg through the osmotic swelling of dry crosslinked polymers exposed to a solvent [ 24 , 26 , 41 ] . Therefore , our analysis must be extended to nonlin - ear large deformations to test high strain rates and power densities based on the inequality D DP ≫ D allowed by the gel diffusio - phoresis [ 39 , 53 ] . Third , hydrogels that combine diffusio - phoresis with periodic actuations by means of cyclic chemical feedback ( such as those in Belousov – Zhabotinsky gels [ 25 , 54 ] ) must be designed to demonstrate feasibility for engineering applications . Altogether , these steps will pave the way for internally powered gel - based proof - of - concept soft robots with enhanced precision , versatility , and dexterity . We thank J . Aizenberg , J .

POST - PROCESSING OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA For uniaxial deformations ( i . e . , no x − dependence ) , we extracted the experimental time - dependent gel height h ( t ) from the tilt angle data of the microplate array patterned into the gel film for real - time deformation readout [ 1 ] . Defining the time - dependent microplate tilt angle as θ ( t ) , the unitless hydrogel height h ( t ) is given by h ( t ) = cos θ ( t ) cos θ 0 , ( S6 ) where θ 0 = 9 o in the native state of the gel without any complexed ions . At t = 0 , the microplate tilt angle is given by θ ( t = 0 ) = 26 . 55 o when the gel backbone is fully saturated with complexed copper ions . Then , using Eq . S6 , the initial unitless height of the hydrogel is h ( t = 0 ) = 0 . 9057 and u z ( z = 1 , t = 0 ) = h ( t = 0 ) − 1 = − γϕ ( b ) = − 0 . 0943 . The initial bound copper volume fraction ϕ ( b ) ( z , t = 0 ) must be half the total volume fraction of the carboxylate groups ( ϕ ∗ = 0 . 036 in the experiments ) since each chelate is composed of two COO − groups and one Cu 2 + ion [ 1 ] . Then , ϕ ( b ) ( z , t = 0 ) = 0 . 018 and is uniform across the gel , which yields γ = 5 . 24 . The other chemical stress prefactor χ can be estimated based on the fact that the gel experimentally returns to its initial height when it reaches final equilibrium with all bound copper ions replaced by the protons at t → ∞ . Since each COO − group is occupied by one proton H + to form a stable COOH group in an acidic environment , lim t →∞ ϕ ( b ) + ( z , t ) = ϕ ∗ = 0 . 036 , which leads to χ = 2 . 62 per the boundary condition in Eq . 14 ( u z ( z ) = zu z ( z = 1 ) at equilibrium at t = 0 and t → ∞ ) . We also estimated the total cross - sectional bound copper in the gel ϕ ( b ) total by linearly interpolating the red channel value ( r - value ) from the optical microscopy of the gel samples with highest r - value corresponding to ϕ ( b ) = 0 and lowest r - value corresponding to ϕ ( b ) = 0 . 018 ( Fig . 2b , d ) . S3 . ANALYTICAL SOLUTION FOR DIFFUSIVE RELAXATION To determine the nature of the height decay in Fig . 1a from the maximum h max = 0 . 985 at t = 0 . 82 τ , here we probe a hypothetical purely diffusive relaxation dynamics by neglecting the second , third , and last terms on the right - hand side of Eq . 13 . Note that , the sum of the second and third terms is negligible , and the flux condition in Eq . 14 is roughly constant because of the rapid displacement of copper by acid , leaving the chemical stresses almost unaltered for the values of γ , χ calculated above and listed in Table I . Solving for purely diffusive relaxation allows us to classify whether the height decay is diffusive , subdiffusive , or superdiffusive . The analytical solution to the diffusion equation ∂u z / ∂t = ∂ 2 u z / ∂z 2 subject to the boundary conditions in Eq . 14 leads to the solution for the gel height h ( t ) = 1 + u z ( 1 , t ) = 1 + c + ∞ X n = 0 ( − 1 ) n A n e − k 2 n t , k n = ( 2 n + 1 ) π 2 , c ≡ − γϕ ( b ) − χϕ ( b ) + ≈ const . , ( S7 ) where the series coefficients A n can be found by using the initial condition u z = u z ( t = 0 . 82 τ ) obtained from the full uniaxial deformation model . Regardless , we are interested in the smallest timescale that gives the fastest decay as the leading order term of Eq . S7 , which is τ D / τ = k − 2 0 = 4 / π 2 ≈ 0 . 4 . ( S8 ) The second smallest timescale proportional to k − 2 1 = ( 2 / 3 π ) 2 is nearly ten times smaller than τ D , so we ignore the higher order terms in Eq . S7 . Then , if the numerical solution of Eq . 13 yields a bigger ( smaller ) timescale than τ D , it corresponds to a subdiffusive ( superdiffusive ) dynamics . Therefore , all decay timescales shown in Fig . S6 point to the subdiffusive relaxation . S4 . GEL DEFORMATION HYSTERESIS The successive swelling and deswelling stages give rise to the hysteresis of the height - averaged gel pressure p avg with respect to the relative change in the gel height h r ( Fig . S7 ) . The area enclosed by a hysteresis curve C de - termines the mechanical work per area done by the gel - supernatant system to its environment , defined as ∆ w ≡ − ( H ¯ p ) − 1 R C p avg dh r in unitless form . In our model , the sign of ∆ w is governed by the competition between the energy gain due to the acid - driven release of copper , which interacts repulsively with the gel backbone in its free state , 3 FIG . S1 . The simulated gel height h ( t ) for uniaxial deformations by using the proprietary COMSOL Multiphysics 5 . 4 FEA Package [ 4 ] and the open - source FEniCS FEA library on Python 3 . 9 [ 5 ] . FIG . S2 . ( a ) , ( b ) The evolution of the vertical displacement u z across the hydrogel for the addition of 1M and 0 . 05M acid , respectively . and the energy loss because of the viscous dissipation associated with the poroelastic deformations . The hysteresis curve for strong acid delivery is shown in Fig . S7a where we find ∆ w = 5 . 62 × 10 − 4 > 0 . The positive sign indicates that the energy lost to dissipation dominates the energy gain due to copper release , enabling the system to do net work to its environment . This amount of work yields a power density of ∼ 11 . 1 mW / kg for the gel sample ( 3 . 2 mg dry weight over an area L 2 ; see Table I ) that completes its deformation cycle roughly over 4 τ . For comparison , other PAA microgels were shown to produce a power output of 260 mW / kg as well as certain porous gels that exhibited 260 mW / kg with 300 % strain and 0 . 2 s − 1 strain rates [ 2 , 3 ] . The main reason for the low power output in our case is that our experiments and theory are concerned with the linear elastic regime . On the other hand , the hysteresis curve for weak acid delivery , shown in Fig . S7b , yields ∆ w = − 5 . 15 × 10 − 4 < 0 ( ∆ W ≈ − 32 µJ over an area L 2 ) because of the negligible swelling as opposed to the considerable copper decomplexation ( Fig . 1c , d ) . 4 FIG . S3 .

FIG . S5 . The relative magnitude of the second and third terms on the right - hand side of Eq . 13 with respect to the time derivative of the vertical displacement . 6 FIG . S6 . The natural logarithm of the relative change of the unitless gel height h r ( t ) / H ≡ [ h ( t ) − h ( 0 ) ] / H with respect to the unitless time t / τ corresponding to the uniaxial deformation simulations for ( a ) strong acid ( Fig . 1a ) and ( b ) weak acid ( Fig . 1c ) . The labels denote the timescales obtained by taking the inverse of the slope at each of the linear section . One exception is the diffusion timescale τ D , which is shown as a guide to the eye to determine that τ r , 1 and τ r , 2 point to a subdiffusive dynamics . FIG . S7 . Gel deformation hysteresis . The variation of the negative of the average gel pressure p avg / ¯ p ≡ R 1 0 pdz with respect to the relative change of the gel height h r ( t ) ≡ h ( t ) − h ( 0 ) in 1D ( uniaxial deformations , Fig . 2a , c ) for ( a ) 1M acid delivery in the linear scale of and ( b ) successive delivery of 0 . 01M and 0 . 05M acid in the logarithmic scale of h r ( t ) . .
