As states move forward toward adoption these models should be referenced for guidance on how to arrange the performance expectations ( PEs ) . States are encouraged to edit the sample mod - els and turn them into state specific models to reflect an organi - zation that works best for the state . There are many unique fac - tors that may influence a state’s decision to arrange the PEs in a particular way . The following is an example of a state revision where the focus is on revising the Conceptual Progressions Course Map described in Table K - 1 . This revision was developed by California’s Science Expert Panel ( SEP ) , a group comprised of kindergarten through grade 12 teachers , scientists , educators , business industry repre - sentatives , and informal science educators . The SEP used the following criteria to arrange the PEs for middle school grades six , seven , and eight : 1 . PEs were placed at each grade level so that they support con - tent articulation across grade levels ( from fifth through eighth grade ) and provide the opportunity for content integration within each grade level . 2 . Performance expectations were aligned with the Common Core State Standards ( CCSS ) in English Language Arts ( ELA ) and Mathematics so that science learning would not be dependent on math skills not yet acquired . 3 . The final arrangement of PEs reflected a balance both in con - tent complexity and number at each grade level with human impact and engineering PEs appropriately integrated . In addition to these criteria , the SEP worked to ensure that the PEs could be bundled together in various ways to facilitate cur - riculum development . TABLE K - 3A California Integrated Learning Progressions Model—Middle School The table below connects the middle school NGSS performance expectations to the component ideas from the Framework . These connections are taken from the information in the NGSS foundation boxes . In this table , the component ideas are arranged into courses based on California’s revised organization .
