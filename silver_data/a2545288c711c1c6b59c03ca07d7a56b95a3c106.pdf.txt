Leading Edge Essay Cell 137 , April 17 , 2009 ©2009 Elsevier Inc . 191 Walls , fences , and barriers : these are the metaphors often used to describe the properties of cellular membranes . Yet , these “walls” are highly dynamic structures that can bend , split , and fuse as cells remodel their stunning variety of shapes and internal structures . To accomplish this feat , cells use proteins that are recruited from the cytosol to reversibly shape membranes into tun - nels , bubbles , furrows , fingers , and feet . In cooperation with the cytoskeleton and with metabolic changes within the phospholipid bilayer , these membrane - shaping proteins fashion the reaction surfaces and compartments that enable organelle biogenesis , intracellular mem - brane trafficking , cell division , and cell migration . Moreover , mechanisms that control membrane morphology underlie cell - cell interactions and thus control development , infection , formation of syncytia , and immune responses . In this Essay , we discuss the membrane - shap - ing proteins of the BAR domain super - family and how they mold membranes in cellular processes and organelles . Prior to the discovery of their mem - brane - remodeling properties , BAR domains were identified as conserved modules shared by the yeast proteins Rvs161 and Rvs167 ( reduced viabil - ity upon starvation ) and the metazoan amphiphysin / BIN ( bridging interactor ) proteins ( Takei et al . , 1999 ; Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ) . Fifteen eukary - otic crystal structures from the super - family have now been solved . Due to primary sequence divergence , the BAR domain crystal of human arfaptin - 2 ( Tar - ricone et al . , 2001 ) was recognized as the founding BAR structure only after a second BAR crystal structure ( of Dros - ophila amphiphysin ) revealed homol - ogy between these domains ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . Together , the crystal struc - tures demonstrate that the BAR domain superfamily is composed of subsets of unique families , including the “classical” BARs , the F - BARs ( Fes / CIP4 homology - BAR ) , and the I - BARs ( Inverse - BAR ) ( Frost et al . , 2007 ; Table 1 ) . Each of these families share the defining elements of a BAR domain : coiled - coils that dimerize into modules with a positively charged surface ( Peter et al . , 2004 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . A recent cryo - EM analysis of the F - BAR dimer found at the N terminus of Toca ( Transducer of cdc42 - dependent actin assembly ) family proteins demonstrated how this module may associate with membranes to shape cylindrical tubules ( Frost et al . , 2008 ) . By fitting atomic mod - els of F - BAR dimers ( Shimada et al . , 2007 ) into cryo - EM reconstructions of membrane tubules , this study showed how clusters of cationic residues on the concave surface of the F - BAR module engage the membrane bilayer and enable rigid F - BAR dimers to impose their cres - cent shapes on the underlying membrane ( Figure 1 ) . Moreover , by visualizing F - BAR modules in a membrane - bound context , this work demonstrated that membrane tubule formation depends on the self - assembly of F - BAR modules into a heli - cal coat ( Figure 1 ) . It will be crucial to determine how these observations reflect the general properties of the superfamily and to establish their relevance to in vivo events . BAR domains may induce membrane curvature de novo ( e . g . , “induced fit” ) , stabilize curvature generated by other forces , or detect curvature in order to recruit cytosolic factors to membranes of a particular shape or size . Inducing and sensing curvature are not exclusive of one another : local deformations caused by BAR domain proteins will facilitate binding of additional BARs and thereby generate a positive - feedback cycle for curvature propagation . Computational studies reinforce the notion that BAR domains can induce both local mem - brane bending and anisotropic mem - brane remodeling over large distances ( Ayton et al . , 2007 ) . Distinctive features of individual BAR domain - containing proteins reveal unique adaptations , suggesting that BAR domains The BAR Domain Superfamily : Membrane - Molding Macromolecules Adam Frost , 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 Vinzenz M .

An upsurge of research now reveals new principles of BAR domain - mediated membrane remodeling , enhancing our understanding of membrane curvature - mediated information processing . 192 Cell 137 , April 17 , 2009 ©2009 Elsevier Inc . can be used in a variety of contexts for dif - ferent functions ( Frost et al . , 2007 ; Table 1 ) . For example , the presence of fl anking phosphoinositide binding motifs ( Lee et al . , 2002 ) or phox ( PX ) or pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domains can help to direct BAR pro - teins to membranes enriched in cognate phosphoinositides . Alternatively , in endo - philin and amphiphysin , BAR domains are conjoined with N - terminal sequences of ~ 26 residues that appear to fold into amphipathic α helices ( so - called N - BAR domains ) in the local environment of the bilayer polar - apolar interface . The inter - calation of this helix into one leafl et of the bilayer may act like a “wedge” that causes local buckling when the polar headgroups of one lipid monolayer are pushed apart , or like an “anchor” that reduces the k off for membrane binding ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Gallop et al . , 2006 ) . Though the sequence of events has not yet been determined , helix insertion may facilitate subsequent binding of the BAR module to enhance or further stabilize curvature . Unexpect - edly , in some BAR domains a convex sur - face ( rather than a concave surface ) is the bilayer - binding interface . These “Inverse” or I - BAR domains promote inverse tubu - lation or the generation of fi lopodia - like extensions ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ) . Linking Membranes with the Cytoskeleton Several members of the BAR domain superfamily provide a link between the membrane and the membrane - asso - ciated cytoskeleton . The nucleation of actin fi laments at the plasma membrane generates mechanical forces that drive migrating cells , cell division , protrusions or invaginations of the membrane , the internalization of vesicles during endo - cytosis , and the “rocketing” of intracel - lular vesicles . F - actin polymerization is triggered by Rho - family GTPases and by the lipids PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , in coordination with nucleating factors such as the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and the Wiskott - Aldrich verpro - lin ( WAVE ) protein ( Takenawa and Suet - sugu , 2007 ) . Many BAR domain proteins are linked to actin nucleation by multiple mechanisms and may coordinate this process with membrane remodeling events . For example , some BAR proteins bind to and help to activate WASP / WAVE proteins . Furthermore , as these BAR proteins form dimers , they functionally dimerize the verprolin - cofi lin - acidic ( VCA ) domains at the C termini of WASP / WAVE proteins . Dimerization of WASP / WAVE VCA domains appears to be a potent means of activating the Arp2 / 3 complex , which is involved in actin nucleation ( Padrick et al . , 2008 ) . In addition , some BAR proteins act as effectors or regula - tors of Rho - family GTPases : they recruit the phosphoinositide phosphatase Synaptojanin , which regulates PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , and dynamin , whose role in membrane fi ssion is intercon - nected with actin dynamics ( Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . Other BAR proteins bind to and “bundle” actin fi bers directly ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . A striking case of this multifunctionality is the protein Tuba ( also called dynamin - binding protein ) , which has four N - terminal SH3 domains , a DH domain , a BAR domain , and two C - terminal SH3 domains . The four N - ter - minal SH3 domains have strong avidity for dynamin , the DH domain is a Cdc42 GEF , and the C - terminal SH3 domains bind directly to N - WASP and Ena / VASP proteins ( Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ) . Regulation by GTPases The physical and functional relation to small GTPases , which together with phosphoinositides recruit cytosolic proteins to membrane compartments , seems to be important for the functions of BAR domain proteins . These GTPases coordinate interactions between BAR proteins , their target membranes , a variety of effector proteins , and actin fi laments ( Habermann , 2004 ) . BAR domain proteins known to interact with small GTPases include arfaptin ( an effector of Arf and a ligand for Rac ) ( Tarricone et al . , 2001 ) ; IRSp53 ( a Rac effector implicated in fi lopodia forma - tion ) ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) ; Toca - 1 , Toca - 2 / FBP17 , and Toca - 3 / CIP4 ( SH3 - depen - dent WASP and dynamin recruitment plus HR1 - dependent Cdc42 binding ) ( Ho et al . , 2004 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ) ; APPL , a Rab5 / 21 effector that participates in growth factor receptor traffi cking and signaling ( Miaczynska et al . , 2004 ) ; and nervous wreck , a synaptic protein that cooperates with Cdc42 on Rab11 - Table 1 .

In fact , the BAR proteins IRSp53 and Arfaptin were initially char - acterized as binding partners for Rac GTPases ( Miki et al . , 2000 ; Tarricone et al . , 2001 ) . These observations hint at a fundamental regulatory network involv - ing the interplay among BAR - mediated membrane deformation , the nucleation of actin fibers , and signaling through small GTPases . Cellular Structures and BAR Proteins Endocytic Tubules and Vesicles Membrane budding to produce vesicles is a process that , by definition , implies the generation of membrane curva - ture . The morphological description of proteins that coat the cytoplasmic surface of vesicles and the subsequent molecular characterization of these vesicular “coats” through biochemical , genetic , and structural studies have given us insights into the mechanisms by which curvature of the membrane bilayer can be generated and stabi - lized . Tubular necks—often observed prior to the fission of coated vesicles from the donor membrane ( Goldenthal et al . , 1984 ) —were thought to result from physical forces pulling on coated buds in the absence of fission ( Figure 1 ) . The discovery of BAR domain pro - teins and the molecular characterization of dynamin and other curvature - gener - ating factors showed how membrane - associated proteins or tubular coats can induce bud neck constriction and the formation of membrane tubules . BAR domain proteins are particularly impor - tant in endocytosis , where the genera - tion of curvature is coupled tightly to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton associated with the plasma membrane . For example , a subset of BAR proteins , including amphiphysin , endophilin and SNX9 , may participate in clathrin - medi - ated endocytosis by acting as hubs of a protein network that coordinates bud neck constriction , actin assembly , and recruitment of downstream factors needed for fission and uncoating ( Takei et al . , 1999 ; Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Yarar et al . , 2007 ) . The more shallow membrane curvature induced by F - BAR proteins ( e . g . , syndapin and Toca ) may deform the bilayer early during curvature induc - tion , although this remains to be tested ( Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . In budding yeast , the BAR proteins Rvs161 / 167 play roles both in endocy - tosis and in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton . Live - cell imaging demon - strates that the Rvs161 / 167 proteins are recruited to late - stage endocytic actin patches , and that in yeast lacking these proteins there is a retraction or “yo - yo” movement of the endocytic membranes generated at these sites after the initial internalization movement ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . These observations support the notion that the Rvs proteins coordi - nately control actin fiber rearrangements , invagination of endocytic buds , and per - haps fission ( as this organism appears to lack an endocytic dynamin ) . More - over , BAR proteins may help to fashion the membrane - trafficking intermediates known as CLathrin - Independent Carri - ers ( CLICs ) or GPI - Enriched Endocytic Figure 1 .

Compartments ( GEECs ) ( Mayor and Pagano , 2007 ) . For example , the BAR - PH and RhoGAP domain - containing protein GRAF1 participates in the clath - rin - independent endocytosis of bacterial exotoxins and GPI - linked proteins ( Lund - mark et al . , 2008 ) . Endosomes Following fission from the plasma mem - brane , nascent vesicles are transported through a hierarchy of endosomal organ - elles that function as signaling and sort - ing stations . From endosomes , some material is rerouted back to the cell sur - face , whereas other material is either targeted to the trans - Golgi network or delivered to lysosomes for degrada - tion . The endosome system comprises a population of morphologically and func - tionally heterogeneous organelles char - acterized by a growing list of unique lipid and protein components including BAR domain proteins such as APPL1 / 2 ( Miac - zynska et al . , 2004 ) and the sorting nex - ins ( Cullen , 2008 ) . These proteins may assist in signaling and sorting processes by generating membrane microdomains or by segregating cargo into tubular extensions of these organelles . Some of the sorting nexins are components of the retromer , a protein complex that acts as a sorting coat on endosomes to mediate transport of trans - membrane cargo back to the trans - Golgi network via tubular transport intermediates ( Bonifacino and Hurley , 2008 ) . The formation of these tubular membranes is most likely attrib - utable , at least in part , to the properties of the PX - BAR proteins SNX1 , SNX2 , SNX5 , and SNX6 . The PX - BAR module most likely drives tubule formation and may recruit the cargo recognition com - plex—composed of Vps26 , Vps29 , and Vps35—to coordinate cargo sorting with membrane tubule formation . T - Tubules T - tubules are narrow tubular invagina - tions of the plasma membrane that propagate electrical signals to the core of skeletal muscle cells and participate in excitation - contraction coupling . The presence of these tubules suggests an abundance of plasma membrane tubu - lating factors . Indeed , a splice vari - ant of the BAR protein amphiphysin - 2 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and is localized on T - tubules ( Lee et al . , 2002 ) . Interestingly , as T - tubules are not endocytic structures , this splice variant lacks binding sites for clathrin and the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 and comprises instead a polybasic sequence ( encoded by exon 10 ) that enhances its affinity for the plasma membrane ( Lee et al . , 2002 ) . This protein , likely in cooperation with other proteins , plays a critical role in the induction and stabilization of this unique organelle . Genetic disruption of the only amphiphysin gene in Drosophila disrupts the T - tubule network ( Razzaq et al . , 2001 ) , and missense mutations in the human gene encoding amphiphysin - 2 cause myopathies ( Nicot et al . , 2007 ) . Podosomes Podosomes are adhesion structures at contact sites between motile cells and their substrates . In contrast to focal adhesions , podosomes are highly dynamic structures that allow cells to translocate rapidly over surfaces and within tissues . They are also sites of extracellular matrix degradation and have been implicated in the migration of metastatic cancer cells ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) . Podosomes are characterized by columnar arrays of actin arranged per - pendicular to the attachment plane of the cell , which often contain a narrow tubular invagination of the plasma mem - brane throughout their length ( Figure 1 ; Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) . Dynamin - 2 and several proteins of the BAR superfamily are concentrated at these sites ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ; P . D . C . , unpublished data ) . Recently , amphiphysin - 1 and dynamin - 2 have been implicated in the formation of tubular structures reminiscent of podo - somes at the junction between Sertoli cells and spermatids in mouse testis ( Kusumi et al . , 2007 ) . The functions of podosome plasma membrane invagina - tions , including a potential endocytic function , remain to be determined . Filopodia One intriguing example of the inter - play between BAR - mediated mem - brane deformation and the actin - based cytoskeleton is found in the formation of some types of filopodia induced by proteins with I - BAR domains ( Mat - tila et al . , 2007 ) . I - BARs are found at the N termini of proteins like IRSp53 and MIM ( missing - in - metastasis ) . The term “inverse” refers to the property of these domains to induce a curvature opposite to that produced by classi - cal BAR domains—that is , protrusions of the plasma membrane rather than invaginations—through their convex and cationic surface ( Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , I - BAR proteins bind to Rac GTPases and to WAVE2 through SH3 domains and also bind to actin directly through WASP - homology 2 ( WH2 ) domains ( Takenawa and Suet - sugu , 2007 ) . Future efforts to visual - ize how I - BAR filopodia connect to actin filaments will advance our under - standing of the mechanical properties and signaling outputs of these unique structures . Mitochondria and Autophagosomes Endophilin - B1 / Bif - 1 plays a role in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphol - ogy . Depletion of endophilin - B1 by RNA interference using short - hairpin RNAs leads to the dissociation of the outer mitochondrial membrane and to the for - mation of vesicular and tubular structures from the remnants of this membrane ( Karbowski et al . , 2004 ) . These results phenocopy knockdown of the dynamin homolog Drp1 ( dynamin - related protein 1 ) , a protein implicated in mitochondrial fission . Thus , Drp1 and endophilin - B1 may act in concert , and perhaps may interact directly , in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology ( Karbowski et al . , 2004 ) . Such a partnership would be reminiscent of the SH3 domain - dynamin interactions that characterize the BAR proteins involved in endocytosis . Endo - philin - B1 also may interact with Bax to promote apoptosis following cytokine withdrawal ( Takahashi et al . , 2005 ) . The connection between endophilin - B1 and apoptosis is particularly intriguing as this protein also appears to play a role in autophagy ( Takahashi et al . , 2007 ) . Cel - lular self - digestion through autophagy is recognized increasingly as fundamental to development , life - span extension , and cell death . Its dysfunction is thought to be implicated in neurodegenerative , car - diovascular , and neoplastic diseases . The process of autophagy involves the sequestration of cytosol and organ - elles into double - membrane vesicles ( autophagosomes ) that undergo a series of shape changes and subsequently fuse with lysosomes for cargo degrada - tion . Though its mechanism of action remains elusive , endophilin - B1 / Bif - 1 was shown recently to be required for Cell 137 , April 17 , 2009 ©2009 Elsevier Inc . 195 the formation of autophagosomes ( Takahashi et al . , 2007 ) . Regarding the potential dual link of endophilin - B1 / Bif - 1 to mitochondrial dynamics and to autophagy , mitochondrial Drp1 - dependent fission may work together with autophagy to elimi - nate damaged mitochondrial pro - teins . Defects in this process may play a role in the neurodegenera - tion underlying Parkinson’s disease ( McBride , 2008 ) . Cleavage Furrows and Contractile Rings The coordination between mem - brane deformation and the cytoskel - eton is nowhere as dramatic as in the formation of the contractile actomyosin ring and the invagina - tion of the plasma membrane dur - ing cell division . In fission yeast , a key participant in this elaborate pro - cess is the essential protein Cdc15 . This protein is a founding member of the FCH ( Fes - Cip4 homology ) motif - containing family , and this sequence is now recognized as part of the F - BAR domain . Cdc15 was described originally as an SH3 domain - containing protein that reg - ulates actin nucleation through recruit - ment of formins and type I myosins ( Roberts - Galbraith and Gould , 2008 ) . Cdc15 appears to act upstream of acto - myosin ring polymerization prior to cell division and localizes with precursors of the contractile ring and fully formed contractile rings throughout cytokinesis ( Wu et al . , 2006 ; Figure 2 ) . Based on the expectation that F - BAR proteins bind to the plasma membrane , Cdc15 may cou - ple the actomyosin ring directly to the membrane while inducing or stabilizing the high degree of curvature observed at the cleavage furrow in fission yeast ( Figure 2 ) . Perhaps BAR proteins regu - late the contractile apparatus during constriction by “sensing” the degree of curvature in the cleavage furrow . Alter - natively , Cdc15 - like proteins may initiate contractile ring formation by bending the membrane inward ; other curvature - sensing proteins may detect or stabilize the still higher degree of curvature found at the point of maximum constriction in order to trigger disassembly of the con - tractile ring . Cdc15 and other BAR proteins are also found at actin patches—known sites of clathrin - mediated endocytosis in yeast— though Cdc15 only concentrates in actin patches at the cell tips during interphase ( Wu et al . , 2006 ; reviewed in Roberts - Gal - braith and Gould , 2008 ) . During mitosis , Cdc15 is dephosphorylated and moves exclusively from cell tips to the precursors of the contractile ring , before becoming an integral component of the fully formed ring ( Figure 2 ) . During constriction of the ring and ingression of the cleavage furrow , re - phosphorylated Cdc15 starts moving to newly formed actin patches adjacent to the cleavage furrow ( that is , at the tips of the future daughter cells ) . Thus , a key question that needs to be addressed is whether the localization of BAR and F - BAR proteins at sites of cell division also reflects the need for ongoing endocytosis within or near the cleavage furrow . In budding yeast and mammalian cells , the degree of membrane curvature found at the division site is dramatically different from the high degree of curvature seen in fission yeast ( Figure 2 ) . Yet there is evi - dence that even in these cells , BAR proteins play key roles during cytoki - nesis . The budding yeast homolog of Cdc15 ( Hof1 / Cyk2 ) is a known cytokinesis factor that forms a ring around the bud neck ( Lippincott and Li , 1998 ) . In addition , a recent study of the S . cerevisiae interactome sug - gests that Syp1—predicted to have a Cdc15 - like F - BAR domain ( Roberts - Galbraith and Gould , 2008 ) —is the hub of a network connecting WASP ( Las17 ) , the bud - neck septins ( SHS1 and Cdc11 ) , a myosin ( Myo5 ) , and the cytokinesis protein Mid2 ( an anillin ortholog ) as well as components of actin patches ( Tarassov et al . , 2008 ) . Finally , the human protein PSTPIP1 possesses F - BAR and SH3 domains that are highly homologous with those of Cdc15 and localizes to the cleavage furrow of cultured human cells ( Spencer et al . , 1997 ) . Together , these observations hint at the exis - tence of an ancient but poorly under - stood circuit linking BAR domain superfamily proteins with cytokine - sis in general and with the assembly , constriction , and disassembly of the contractile ring in particular . Conclusions The membrane - molding proteins of the BAR domain superfamily create a multi - plicity of membranous structures whose forms underlie the function of many cel - lular processes . As fundamental deter - minants of membrane and cytoskel - eton remodeling , proteins of the BAR domain superfamily will continue to be rich objects of inquiry . Their study has revealed new principles of membrane remodeling and contributed to establish - ing the concept of membrane curvature - mediated signaling . Challenging next steps will be to visualize and quantify their associations with membranes and cytoskeletal structures in living cells . Moreover , we have much to learn about their polymerization properties and the mechanisms by which cells regulate their nucleation and disassembly . It is hoped that further inquiry will yield novel insights into the growing number of dis - eases that result from BAR protein dys - function and may point to new therapeu - tic strategies for the treatment of these conditions .
