However , there is currently little detailed information about the spatial movements of this epidemiologically important age group . To address this knowledge gap , we collaborated with eight secondary schools to conduct a survey of movement patterns of school pupils in primary and secondary schools in the United Kingdom . We found evidence of a significant change in behaviour between term time and holidays , with term time weekdays character - ised by predominately local movements , and holidays seeing much broader variation in travel patterns . Studies that use mathematical models to examine epidemic transmission and control often use adult commuting data as a proxy for population movements . We show that while these data share some features with the movement patterns reported by school children , there are some crucial differences between the movements of children and adult commuters during both term - time and holidays . Introduction The social mixing behaviour of school - aged children is believed to be an important driving fac - tor of infectious disease spread . Levels of susceptibility and social mixing are likely to be higher amongst school children than any other age group , and the relatively high levels of incidence of many common infections in children identifies them as an important epidemiological group [ 1 – 5 ] . Significant efforts have been made in recent years to quantify human social mixing patterns with a view to improving our understanding of the transmission dynamics of infection [ 6 – 11 ] . There has been a particular focus on quantifying the amount of interaction between different age groups . Studies have consistently shown that school - aged children make large numbers of social contacts , predominantly with other school - aged children [ 8 , 12 ] . Recent work has quan - tified the extent to which mixing patterns change during school holiday periods ; as might be expected , children make fewer contacts during school holidays , with the greatest reduction being in the number of contacts with other children [ 13 , 14 ] .

The funders had no role in study These social mixing studies have provided the essential information necessary to interpret age - stratified incidence patterns of common infectious diseases . Likewise , information on the movement of individuals is essential for understanding , and predicting , the spatial spread of in - fection . Mathematical models have been developed to predict the spatial dispersal of infection based upon human movement data [ 15 – 19 ] . Currently , available movement data are largely re - stricted to commuting information [ 20 – 22 ] , long distance travel ( e . g . air - travel [ 23 , 24 ] ) and a variety of proxy measures , from banknotes [ 25 ] to mobile phones [ 26 ] . While all of these sources are likely to be useful , none provide much information about the movements of school - aged children , the key drivers of transmission for many common infectious diseases . Some countries , such as Switzerland , do conduct more detailed diary - based studies of travel patterns [ 27 ] , which have been used to inform mathematical models [ 28 , 29 ] . However , such data is not yet available for the United Kingdom . Here , we present the results of a study of the spatial movement patterns of school children , carried out in sixteen schools across the UK . Movements were measured both during school term times and school holidays , allowing a picture to be built up of the seasonal changes in spa - tial mixing behaviour of children . Materials and Methods We worked with groups of schools during the 2011 – 12 and 2012 – 13 academic years to devise and carry out a project to measure movement patterns of school children during term time and school holidays . The methodology was based on an earlier project in which secondary school pupils quantified the social networks present in their local primary schools [ 30 ] . During each academic year we worked alongside 4 secondary schools to design a question - naire , collect , and analyse data . Interaction was mainly through video - conferences , which al - lowed the school students to share ideas with each other as well as with the researchers , and visits from the researchers to the schools . The project was conceived partly as public engage - ment , partly as outreach , and partly as research [ 31 ] ; one of the main aims of the project was to give support to students in developing their research questions and methods . During the development phase of the study , students worked to devise a survey that would quantify the distance travelled by school pupils , both in term time and holidays . The final ques - tionnaire was agreed upon by all schools , and a consistent version used throughout the project . It was intended to use the questionnaire in both secondary and primary schools , so it was de - signed to be as simple to complete as possible . Pupils and schools planned the details of their engagement with participants to best suit their local circumstances . The final survey asked participants to report , for each day over a two week period ( including one week of term time and one week of school holidays ) , the furthest they were from home that day . The question was posed both as a set of distance options ( at home all day ; < 1 mile ; 1 – 5 miles ; 5 – 30 miles ; 30 – 100 miles ; > 100 miles ) and by asking for the location ( either as a place name , street name , or postcode ) . Where places were reported , these were converted into postcodes ( using the first half of the postcode only ) where possible . Questionnaires were distributed with explanation at start of the fortnight , and could be filled in by participants or by their parents on their behalf , or by a combination of the two ; it was left for individual families to decide on the approach that best suited them . To reduce recall errors , participants were encouraged to complete the survey daily during the study period . In the first year the study period included a week of the Easter holiday ; in the second year the study period included the week - long Spring half term holiday . This change was motivated both by the need to fit the project in around the school timetable , and as a result of suggestions by participating schools that it would lead to an improved return rate .

Competing Interests : The authors have declared that no competing interests exist . For analysis purposes , we categorised days as ‘ term time weekdays ’ , ‘ holiday weekdays ’ or ‘ weekends ’ and compared reported movements during these periods by calculating the propor - tion of reported trips that fell into each distance category . We calculated bootstrapped confi - dence intervals for these proportions by repeatedly resampling the data with replacement to obtain multiple alternate datasets of the same size . To compare school patterns with adult movements , we also measured the commuting distances reported in the 2001 census in the 17 UK electoral wards that covered our study locations [ 32 ] . Across these wards , in the 2001 cen - sus 12 , 792 adults reported commuting movements [ 33 ] . Distances were measured from the centroid of the home ward to the centroid of the work ward , and assigned to the same set of categories as used in the school questionnaire , except that we did not include a category for ‘ at home ’ because these data were not available . In addition to providing estimates for the maximum distance travelled , participants were also encouraged to report the ( full or partial ) postcode of the furthest location from home to which they travelled . Postcodes were then geo - referenced to UK national grid co - ordinates using the Office of National Statistics Postcode Directory ( ONSPD ) . These data allowed the creation of maps demonstrating the approximate location of movements . Locations with an in - complete postcode were assigned a unique geo - location using the centroid of all partially matching postcodes . Mapped locations were jittered uniformly within 2 . 5km squares to avoid over plotting and to preserve anonymity . Maps were created using digital boundaries and data - bases provided by the Office of National Statistics through the Open Geography portal . Participation in this opt - in study was voluntary , and informed written consent was obtained from parents / guardians on behalf of the children taking part in the study . All analysis was car - ried out on anonymised data . The study was approved by the ethics committee of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine . Results During the 2011 – 12 and 2012 – 13 academic years , the travel movement questionnaire was given to students in 16 schools in urban and rural locations around the UK . 825 questionnaires were returned with sufficient information ( age and / or year group of participant ) to be included in the final database ( S1 dataset ) . 208 were returned in the first year , and 617 in the second year . Details of the number of questionnaires given out by each school group were not available in every case ; the return rate was approximately 10 % in the first year , and in the second year , where we have this information , the return rate was approximately 42 % ( 520 out of 1226 sur - veys returned ) . Returned surveys were reasonably complete ; 2 . 6 % of distance reports ( 2 . 9 % in year 1 and 2 . 5 % in year 2 ) and 8 . 6 % of postcode reports were missing ( 6 . 4 % in year 1 , 9 . 3 % in year 2 ) . The geographic distribution of reported movements is shown in Fig 1 . We found a distinct difference in movement patterns between term time and holidays . During term - time weekdays , most trips cluster around the home location , whereas travel patterns span a markedly wider area during holidays and weekends . The long distance trips from Buckinghamshire to Cornwall in term - time were the result of a class trip . During both term time and holidays , the majority of daily movements were under 30 miles ( Figs 2A and 2B ) . However , we saw a significant difference between reported weekday move - ments in term time and holidays ( p < 0 . 0001 using chi - squared test with 6 degrees of freedom ) . When compared to holidays , term time movements tended to cluster around short distances ; during term time , 76 % of daily movements were in the under 1 mile and 1 – 5 miles categories , compared to 40 % in holidays . In holidays , daily movements display a broader distribution , with an increase in both shorter and longer movements ( 27 % of days were spent at home , Seasonal Variation in the Movement Patterns of School Children PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128070 June 1 , 2015 3 / 10 compared to 5 % during term time , and 15 % reported distances over 30 miles from home , com - pared to 3 % during term time ) . Weekend movements appear to be qualitatively more similar to holiday movements than to term time movements ( Fig 2C ) . When comparing our results with commuting patterns reported in the 2001 Census in the electoral wards of our study loca - tions ( Fig 2D ) , we found that adult commuters ’ movements resemble school pupils ’ move - ments during term time , with most trips between 1 and 5 miles . However , there were significantly more long distance trips reported by adults in the Census than by children on term weekdays in our study : 16 % of reported commuter movements were over 30 miles . We found that travel movements were different in Easter and half term holidays . During the two - week Easter break , there were more trips of more than 100 miles , and fewer days spent at home ( S1 Fig ) . We also found some differences in travel movements between urban ( i . e . based within town or city ) and rural schools . Although the overall pattern of movement during term , holidays and weekends was similar , participants in urban areas made fewer long trips during holiday weekdays , and spent fewer days at home at weekends than participants in rural areas ( S2 Fig ) . The maximum distance travelled by an individual during the course of a holiday week was , as might be expected , considerably further than the maximum distance travelled during a term - time week ( Figs 3A and 3B ) . During the holiday week , 31 % of participants in the study travelled at least 30 miles , compared with only 8 % during the term week . There were also sig - nificantly more participants who spent all week at home : 4 % did so during the holidays , but less than 1 % during term . When comparing the maximum distance travelled during term time and holidays at the individual level ( Fig 3C ) , we see a clear tendency for participants to report travelling further from home during holidays than during term time . We also examined the accuracy of distance reporting . Participants reported a complete post - code for 3 , 239 trips , of which 3 , 092 had matching self reported distances . This made it possible to compare travel distance as measured by postcode with self - reporting for this subset of the Fig 1 .

Each origin and destination was assigned a spatial location as the centroid of the reported postcode area . The Euclidean distance between these centroids was used to calculate a distance category for each trip using the same categories as for self reporting . There was some possible misclassification in all categories . However , overall 85 % of trips ( 2633 reported movements ) differed by one or fewer categories from the postcode - estimated distance .

We have quantified the range of distances travelled during school term time and school holidays , and shown that holidays are associated with both more days spent at home and with more long distance movements than term time . These patterns are significantly different to those found in the commuting data [ 20 – 22 ] commonly used to parameterise spatial models of human disease transmission . Given the importance of children as drivers of infection [ 1 – 5 ] , our results suggest that the geographical spread of disease could in reality differ greatly from existing model predictions . There are some limitations to our study . Data were self - reported , and it is not clear how ac - curately participants could identify the distances they travelled . However , assistance was given using relevant local examples when surveys were distributed , and it is likely that participants could make reasonable comparisons between different journeys , which would mean that the trend is reported consistently . The response rate was disappointingly low in some schools , which is perhaps inevitable given the nature of the survey , which had to be completed over the course of a fortnight . We considered the use of web - based data collection , but took the view that this would still require active participation over many days and would potentially exclude participants on access grounds . A survey that could have been answered as a one - off would likely have produced a better response [ 30 ] , but we would not be confident that activities would have been accurately recalled and , as we have found , there is value in collecting informa - tion about movements each day as opposed to — for example — simply asking about the longest movement over the course of a week . Moreover , while movement patterns of school - aged par - ticipants appear to be different from reported commuting patterns ( Fig 2 ) , weekend and holi - day trips made by children are likely to be associated the travel patterns of the parents / guardians . Hence our results suggest that the out - of - term travel patterns of certain adults also differ from the movements reported by commuters in the 2001 Census . The study was carried out by different student researchers in different schools , and survey methodology may not have been identical in each case . However , many observed differences between schools are likely to be genuine . For example , we found evidence that the movement patterns in large towns were typically more localised than those in rural settings , and that more long distance trips took place in the Easter holiday than in the Spring half term holiday . There - fore it may be inappropriate to model movement patterns by assuming that all holiday periods are identical . However , some effects may have been the result of other unmeasured factors ( e . g . local leisure provision or social - demographic factors ) . Ideally , we would repeat the survey in the same school throughout the year , but this was not feasible within the time constraints of the study . Despite these limitations , the implications of the results for infectious disease spread are clear . Longer distance movements during holidays offer the potential for infection to move from place to place ; such translocations of infection could be facilitated by the movement of ei - ther susceptible or infected individuals . Although infected individuals may modify their behav - iour [ 34 ] , the movement patterns described here would apply to pathogens that lead to mild or asymptomatic infections , or those for which individuals are infectious before they are symptomatic . Our results suggest that term time is associated with intense local spread , whereas holidays , although involving a lower absolute contact rate [ 2 ] , present opportunities for infection to move long distances . The change in movement patterns is likely to be particularly influential in the case of a school - based outbreak that reaches a high level just before a holiday period , thus releasing a large number of cases to seed infection to new parts of the country . In such an Seasonal Variation in the Movement Patterns of School Children PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0128070 June 1 , 2015 7 / 10 example , school closure — while having the potential benefit of reducing the local force of infec - tion — might have a different effect when considered at a larger spatial scale .
