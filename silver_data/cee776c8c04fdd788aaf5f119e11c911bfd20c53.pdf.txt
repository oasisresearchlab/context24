Designing with AI : An Exploration of Co - Ideation with Image Generators abstract This pictorial showcases the integration of AI into the design process through the use of image generators . Following a Research Through Design ( RTD ) approach , we recruited 6 designers to create design proposals with AI . They were invited to collect case studies , make annotated portfolios , collaborate with the generator for design ideation , and undergo semi - structured interviews . Through this process , we gathered empirical data to investigate how designers ideate with AI and what opportunities and challenges emerge in the collaboration . The results showed that the combination of human and AI input in the design process contributes to a fresh form of self - expression and communication . AI was found to bring a distinct perspective that opens up new avenues for artistic expression . The research highlights the potential of AI to augment human creativity and the need for ongoing exploration in this field . Introduction Author keywords CSS Concepts This trend is driven by the advancements in AI technology , which allow AI systems to generate creative outputs , and the potential benefits of combining the strengths of both humans and AI . In this pictorial , we focus on the collaboration between humans and AI in the context of image generation.  Recent research has demonstrated the potential of generative AI systems in design and creative tasks [ 19 , 14 ] . Muller et al . present GenAICHI , a framework for generative AI and HCI that aims to facilitate collaboration between humans and AI in design tasks [ 14 ] . On the other hand , Sbai et al . highlight the potential of generative networks in providing design inspiration for human designers [ 19 ] . Collectively , these studies indicate the significant impact of generative AI and collaboration with designers in the design field and the urgent need to further investigate this topic . With the growing interest and application of generative AI in the design industry , it is crucial to understand the implications and potential of this technology in shaping the future of design.  In terms of co - creation with AI in design , Oh et al . investigated the user experience of co - creation with AI [ 17 ] . They found that a balance between human control and AI support is vital to craft positive user experience . Koch et al . explored the use of cooperative contextual bandits in design ideation with AI [ 11 ] . They showed that the system can effectively support human designers in generating new design ideas . In addition , Weisz et al . ’s work stressed the importance of developing general design principles for generative AI and proposed guidelines from a computer science perspective [ 24 ] . Taken together , although they offer insights for boosting creativity , they focus less on human - centric , empirical evaluations of applying a text - to - image generator to the design process.  Image generation with generative AI can be regarded as creating new images based on existing data and algorithms . It involves using machine learning models and computer vision techniques to generate images similar to real - world objects or scenes . Some popular image generation technologies include In recent years , the field of Human - Computer Interaction ( HCI ) has seen a growing interest in collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence ( AI ) systems in design and creativity tasks [ 11 , 10 , 25 , 22 ] . Midjourney ; design process ; ideation ; image generator Generative Adversarial Networks ( GANs ) and Variational Autoencoders ( VAEs ) . Recently , image generation has gained increasing attention . A number of designers have started to experiment with incorporating it into their design processes [ 17 ] . For example , they used it to generate new designs , textures , or patterns . In this way , they produced creative design ideas and fascinating works , which implies the possible benefits of collaboration between humans and AI in design tasks . However , despite the potentials and growing popularity of image generation , insufficient research has inquired into its impact on the design process . Further studies are needed to understand : How do designers work with the generator in practice ? In what manners can it enhance collaboration and avoid tensions between designers and AI ? In this pictorial , we investigate these questions with a Research through Design approach [ 4 ] . The research aims to explore the opportunities and problems that arise in the partnership between designers and AI . We invited participants to experience a design ideation activity with an AI image generator available named Midjourney ( MJ ) [ 9 ] . In the process , they gathered design cases , made annotated portfolios , worked with the generator to create design ideas , and completed semi - structured interviews after the ideation [ 13 ] . The findings demonstrated that combining human and AI input during the design process leads to a novel form of communication and self - expression . AI offers a unique perspective that inspires new possibilities for artistic expression . Based on the empirical data , we derive three themes and corresponding recommendations to reflect the reality of AI ' s integration into the design process . Our study offers two contributions . First , we recognize the potential for AI to support human creativity from an interaction design perspective and inspire future works for the HCI field . Next , we offer suggestions of how AI can be integrated into the design process , which provides insights into the co - creation of human and generative AI applications [ 24 ] .

Participant 1 selected " radio for adults to play . ” In the pilot study , we provided three participants with a single word as a design topic and asked them to use a moodboard along with Midjourney as part of their design process . Based on this pilot study , we identified two adjustments that needed to be made to the experimental procedure . Firstly , the design prompts needed to include more details , and secondly , the participants required additional keyword materials to input into the image generator.  To address these issues , we incorporated resources to assist the participants in developing keywords and strategies . The participants were instructed to collect examples relevant to the design theme and create annotated portfolios based on these cases [ 6 ] . Prior to the experiment , the participants were asked to find five examples and provide at least five comments for each annotation . The comments could be either abstract or concrete , and the participants were given examples to guide their annotating process.  We invited the participants to categorize the annotations , which can be based on the design frameworks they usually consider when making decisions , or on the categorization generated based on the characteristics of the annotations . The primary purpose of this categorization is to structure the keywords from the previous step ' s annotations and test if this structured reference material is helpful in facilitating interaction and co - ideation between the participants and the text - to - image generator . What did we do ? Reflections Plan beforehand Be more varied The more the better Participant 4 discovered that in the past , he would take more time while using the image generator to alter the text input because he would consider what to enter as he generated . However , utilizing annotated portfolios to plan out the text input and design direction beforehand makes it possible to choose the text to input more quickly and accurately , and the outcomes are more in line with expectations.   Participant 6 felt that the examples searched for during this phase ought to be more varied . She found that looking for too many similar cases makes it simpler to repeat annotations , which is detrimental to brainstorming with AI.   Participant 2 believed that having a mandated quantity of annotations helped her generate more perspectives , as it pushed her to re - enter a brainstorming state in order to meet the required amount , leading to the generation of more unique ideas . The process of co - ideation with AI Competitor Analysis Moodboard Design Guideline Other design methods that can be referred to at this stage : Please see the figure on P . 8 Card sorting Affinity diagrams Mind map Other design methods that can be referred to at this stage : Participant 1 said that the design theme contains details to make the goal of the design process much clearer . Basically , after the three elements are defined , there will be a space for association , which is better than a single - word topic.  Participant 2 said her previous design practices were equivalent to the categorization behavior:   “I often design within a framework , so I ' ve organized my annotations using the interactive design framework . I ' ve listed all the factors that must be taken into account while creating this artifact , so I start with " content , form , and interaction , " and since the subject is a camera , I also include a more ambiguous category called " ways of seeing . ” The content of this category refers to what I want to achieve at the abstract level . For example , a picture of a child poking his head out of a box reminds me of out of box thinking . I think of this step as the North star , guiding me to a clear design purpose and reminding me of the different types of design decisions that need to be made in this design . ”   Participant 3 also indicated that this step was not unfamiliar . She recalled her experience in using another design method , affinity diagrams , to organize originally scattered ideas into a coherent concept through subject classification.   Participant 4 recalled his experience in a website design workshop : " It was like doing card sorting , where while sorting out basic items , you would also want to add other details . Unexpected ideas related to the classification would pop up . " Midjourney was chosen as the image generator for our study due to its prominence in discussions and availability for online free trials . The design topics used in the experiment were selected from popular design challenges within the Midjourney community.  Covering different backgrounds of participants , we selected six designers representing various disciplines , such as graphic design , interactive design , product design , and architecture . Their familiarity with image generation tools varied . The age range of the participants spanned from 20 to 36 years , with an equal distribution between genders.  1942 4 Text - to - image Generator What did we do ? Reflections The participants were asked to create images using a generator called Midjourney after a brief tutorial . They could use any of the available web tools , such as the community showcase , prompt helper , ChatGPT , but they had to annotate the text they entered to help researchers understand why it was there . In order to determine whether these images live up to the expectations of the input text , whether they are cherished by the participants , and how they are used in the future , they are also asked to record their feelings after creating the images.   The top three most commonly cited reasons for selecting keywords , according to the data we have gathered , are : Synonyms / Equivalent Words , Written based on annotated material and random ideas . Although different participants employ keywords in various ways and a single prompt may contain keywords from several distinct sources , the occurrence of these three factors throughout the experiment suggests a general trend : The participants often use pre - written annotations , and if necessary , they may replace them with synonyms . If the results are unsatisfactory , they may also add some keywords at random Furthermore , the top three preferences among the participants towards the generated images are : Different from expectation but favorable , Different from expectation and unfavorable , and No preference . It is worth noting that the number of notes for the first two options are equally high , at 24 each , and the number of notes for “Same as expectation and favorable” and “Same as expectation but unfavorable” are also equally balanced , at 6 each . This indicates that , for the participants , the generated image results are more often different from their expectations , and their level of favorability towards the images is equal regardless of whether the results align with their expectations or not .

After creating images by generator , we invited the participants to draw a proposal sketch for the subject and asked them to elaborate on the interactive form , function , size , appearance , and material of the artificial creation . After completing the sketch , they explained to us the development process and design rationale behind their idea.  They identified their least preferred or disappointing generated images and discussed their impact on keyword usage strategies . Additionally , we explored whether the participants had conceptual frameworks in mind before using MJ and examined how the different stages of operation affected the development of these frameworks . The participants also provided insights into their preference between image - to - image generation and keyword - based interactions , as well as which MJ features they found most useful and how the generated images exhibited distinct characteristics.   Lastly , we asked the participants to create two sketches : one depicting their typical design process and another illustrating the new process after AI intervention . These sketches , along with the participants ' reflections on the generated images , allowed us to gain insights into the conceptual flow and the impact of the generated images.   By carefully reviewing the sketches and conducting a thematic analysis of the semi - structured interviews , we will further explore the findings and implications of using annotated portfolios and AI in the design co - creation process . During the interviews , we explored several directions to understand the participants ' perceptions and the effectiveness of using annotated portfolios and AI in the design process.   Firstly , we inquired about the participants ' thoughts on the operational aspects of annotated portfolios . We asked about their experiences in annotating and whether they encountered any difficulties or gained new ideas during the annotation process . Additionally , we sought insights into how the participants categorized these annotations and whether these categorizations facilitated their use of Midjourney ( MJ ) , the AI interface.   Secondly , we discussed how AI assisted the participants in their design tasks , focusing on the usability of MJ . The participants shared their experiences , highlighting any issues encountered during the process of communicating with MJ and the strategies they employed when using keywords . They also expressed their preferences for the generated images and examined the influence of these images on their design decisions . Furthermore , the participants addressed the challenges they faced during communication with MJ , including instances where they perceived MJ as being unintelligent or having difficulty understanding their intentions . We instructed the participants to sketch out a design flowchart and describe which processes are divergent and which are convergent [ 2 ] , as well as how these steps relate to one another and affect the final design proposal.   Due to the greater quantity and complexity of the empirical data possessed by these two steps , they will be categorized into three primary themes in later parts , and the insights discovered through further interviews will be extensively discussed . 1944 The relationship between image generators and humans can be characterized as a reciprocal exchange of resources , with both parties converting their internal resources into a form that can be understood by the other . This requires effort from both sides to understand and apply the information provided . For humans , there are two communication barriers to overcome : firstly , accurately expressing inner thoughts through text or other input parameters , and secondly , interpreting the images generated by the image generator . The latter also involves evaluating the effectiveness of their own verbal communication . In 2012 , Bill Gaver and John Bowers introduced the concept of annotated portfolios as a form of reflective practice . An annotated portfolio typically includes short comments or explanations about the elements of a work , along with evidence documenting the project ' s development and the knowledge and insights gained throughout the process [ 8 , 7 , 6 ] . The annotation enables a more understandable representation of a work ' s quality and allows the user to assess it from numerous angles , which promotes learning and transfer . While moodboard can facilitate creative behavior through visually appealing images , collaboration with a text - to - image generator necessitates more than just images . Image generators need to understand human’s intention through texts . Generating text involves not only creative writing , but also the transformation of ideas through annotation . Participants employ annotated portfolios as a method to externalize their internal thoughts and , through the adoption of text classification , generate executable keyword sets . These keyword sets can be modularized and easily used as prompts.

The exchange process between MJ and humans is a bidirectional search , which can be represented graphically through the feedback provided . From the initial ideation stage , humans develop an idea and employ various methods to analyze , deconstruct , or present it , such as using a moodboard . However , in our pilot study , we found that the participants faced difficulty in translating the results of moodboards into keyword inputs . This gap in generating keywords signifies the challenge individuals encounter when expressing their internal ideas . To bridge this gap , our study introduced the annotated portfolio tool , enabling the participants to transform their internal ideas into external resources . Midjourney then utilizes these internal resources , leveraging natural language understanding and image generation capabilities , to generate images as external resources . Upon receiving the images , individuals generate additional ideas and continue this iterative process until they arrive at a satisfactory idea . A Fresh Form of Communication T h e m e s Midjourney  ( text - to - image generator ) inward Transit  understanding interpret into image inspire inward outward Human Prompt Image NLP Generator Idea Method Gap Understand text develop Generate keywords Annotated portfolios to fill the gap 1945 Strateg y of prompting Currently , Midjourney has two types of inputs that can be used as prompts : texts and images . While texts can be used as a standalone prompt , images must be entered together with texts . These two types of materials have been found to exhibit different characteristics in the participants ' applications , which will be discussed below based on examples of participant operations during the experiment.  At the beginning , Participant 5 randomly entered a keyword and generated an augmented reality device that looked similar to VR glasses . However , the generated image was different from what was expected , and P5 did not like it , finding it too ordinary and unsatisfactory . " I expect MJ to produce some images that I didn ' t expect , hoping that the generator can help me exceed myself rather than give me concepts that I have already seen . " Later , Participant 5 tried using a keyword from the annotation example as a prompt and obtained a satisfactory result , but felt that " it was still lacking a little , maybe because I did not describe its color or style . I decided to use the image remix function to add style - related text to the image . " Participant 5 then chose one of the images and used the remix function to mix the image with the words " white " and " Bauhaus " to produce a new image . She was very satisfied with the result : " This is the style I want , but I did not expect that the three small images would be fused into one image and produce a new object after being remixed . I particularly like this concept in the result . I think I have achieved a satisfactory result . " The participant then used the Ultimate function to increase the detail and resolution of the selected image and started sketching.  Participant 5 obtained a relatively satisfactory result using the materials annotated with keywords as prompts , and did not choose to generate a new , more accurate image by re - entering a prompt , but rather used Remix to complement the missing keywords based on the result . Regarding this behavior , the participant stated that she did not want to bear the risk of complete unknowns again . Even when using image generation tools , she preferred to continue to develop images based on a foundation with coherence . a synesthesia machine , with function to detect frequencies beyond human hearing ability , transform frequencies into virtual reality image a wearable sound device that can receive and send signals , high tech metallic material , simple interface , cover eyes and ears , AI assistant , works as prosthetic to enhance sensibility , transform signals into visual and human hearable sound white , bauhaus Prompt : Prompt written based on annotated material Remix Prompt written randomly Ultimate The Remix feature allows for re - input of texts or images , merging them with previously generated images.  1946 Participant 2 suggested that there are two types of keywords in her annotations : operational and conceptual . She explained that she referred to her pre - prepared annotations to determine which concepts to use , and then considered how to input them into the Midjourney prompts . For instance , she noted that the term " ways to speculate " is a concept that cannot fully capture the mental image in her mind , so it may require deconstruction into more specific words that describe the abstract concept in a concrete way , such as " a kid speculating what she sees via a toy camera with pastel colors . " This helped the AI generate more accurate results . On the other hand , keywords like " pastel colors " or " Polaroid camera " are more operational , as they are already specific and concrete terms that can give corresponding results , and they have less ambiguity.   Participant 2 also pointed out that conceptual keywords often have vague , abstract , or even polysemous characteristics , which may lead to unexpected results when used as prompt inputs . She described a feeling of serendipity during the exploration phase of using the tool , but also noted that this can become frustrating during the convergence phase . Operational keywords , however , are more concrete and have a narrower scope of meaning , making the results more predictable . While predictable results help establish expectations for tool operation , Participant 2 believed they do not necessarily enhance human creativity , but rather improve image quality and detail.   a kid speculating what he sees via a toy camera with pastel colors.  ways to speculate During the image generation process , P2 also mentioned that as English is not her native language , but the primary language used to communicate with the generator , she sometimes felt unsure whether the keywords she used could convey her intended meaning . To confirm whether her expressions were correct , she chose to search for keywords in the community showcase and observe how others use them in their prompts . For instance , when she initially used the keyword " viewfinder , " she could not create a composition showing the first - person perspective looking through a viewfinder . After several failed attempts , she searched for " viewfinder " in the community showcase and discovered that the prompt used to create the first - person perspective was " digital camera viewfinder . " Following this prompt , she was able to generate the desired perspective . Later , when she attempted to display a family ' s image on the viewfinder ' s screen , she added the phrase " on the viewfinder you can see a family in the living room " to generate the corresponding result , adding details and finalizing the image . Ultimate holding a polaroid camera , looking into the viewfinder on top , white dot holding a polaroid camera , digital camera viewfinder , on the viewfinder you can see the beautiful scene  holding a pastel teal polaroid camera , digital camera viewfinder , on the viewfinder you can see a family in the living room 1947 A B C D E Participant 1 pointed out that when generating images , he hoped the images would be clear products with a specific form , texture , and concept . He also hoped that the images would be close to the final rendering of the product . Based on the five example images he collected earlier , he identified five different conceptual themes and decided to directly use the example images as input for each concept , adding relevant annotations he wrote for the examples . The generated images , as shown in the figure , had some recognizable similarities to the examples : " I think it ' s amazing that the generated images are similar in structure to the example images I found , especially in Image A [ 18 ] . The radio in the image maintains the puzzle - like block structure , but due to the keyword ' globetrotting , ' it becomes circular and produces a pattern similar to the earth . I think MJ ' s strategy of generating four small images first is good . It shows four possibilities of the combined keywords . "   For the designers , it is not always necessary to generate completely new ideas . Participant 1 said , " I want to know how to arrange the interface in a minimalist framework , and Image B [ 21 ] moved the interface from the top to the front , which I found to be an interesting enough variation . "   " Image C [ 26 ] moved the button to the top and used brighter colors , which made me feel like it was a product suitable for gamers . It became more playful and had brighter colors than the original design . "   Participant 1 also believed that Image D [ 12 ] turned the original horizontal interface into a vertical one , which made him think that he could create a related product simply by changing the direction of operation without altering the current material or design . " If I were to design a second - generation product based on this radio , I would adopt this direction . I think it ' s a good inspiration . "   Changing parts of the images proved to be a challenging task for Participant 1 . " I tried to change the screen in Image E [ 20 ] to display stock charts because it is a radio for listening to stock market information , but the effect was limited . I don ' t know how to change just the screen without altering the design . " Framework matters : Analyzing design topics through applied frameworks ( e . g . , interactive design , product design ) involving a structured approach will be helpful.   Plan beforehand : Preparation of relevant data precedes engaging with AI interfaces . It is essential to understand the intended purposes of different terms and phrases in order to apply them appropriately . Step by step : Instead of treating design as a singular entity , it is beneficial to break it down into distinct processes . Taste is the key : Developing a discerning taste facilitates effective decision - making . Be open - minded : Maintaining an open mindset involves utilizing various online tools and conducting multiple tests . Sharing strategies and fostering discussions contribute to collaborative efforts . Review to improve : Reviewing the generated images allows for experiential accumulation and refinement . Implications for generating prompts 1948 Scenario Image : Scenario - based elements that involve the interaction between the artifact , user , and environment.  The participants gained creative inspiration through the Scenario - based elements and the interactions in the image . The design of the artifact in the picture may not be ideal , but the relationships and the possibilities generated by the interaction are valuable to the participants . Regarding the topic of " a chair for children to play , " participant 3 believed that although she didn ' t like the design of the chair in the picture , the image of having a pet companion gave her inspiration to design a chair that can be used by both children and pets . Concept Image : Offering abstract elements for concept . The image does not depict any object related to the design topic , but provides the participants with abstract inspiration . Although the purpose of the image is unclear and even not part of the participants ' expected results from the generation strategy , its ambiguous and imperfect characteristics prompt the participants to interpret the image from a higher level and extract unexpected insights . In response to the design topic " a camera for children to speculate , " participant 2 initially input " see the world through the lens of children . " She initially expected AI to generate an image of a child holding a camera and taking pictures , but due to her lack of familiarity with English , she did not realize that " lens " was interpreted as a magnifying glass and " world " as a globe.   " Concept of globe or magnifying glass , which I had not considered in my attempt , although I didn ' t end up using either of these outcomes , I definitely felt a spark in my mind and thought of another abstract idea . " Participant 5 was inspired by this image to design a network - usable device that numerous people could link together . Despite the fact that the object itself had nothing to do with the drawing and it was impossible to see what was being drawn , it pointed her in a direction she never would have imagined.  Desig ner as Curator In the process of collaborating with the generator , humans have transitioned from traditional creator roles to creators with curation skills . They select keywords related to a particular theme to generate relevant images and then choose elements from the generated images to combine and apply to convey meaning . Based on feedback from the experiment , we can classify the image applications into three types : concept , scenario , and form . We provide actual examples to illustrate how to distinguish between these three types of images and how they offer insights to the participants.   1949 shutter antenna holder dog paws fluffy case strap SpaceDog camera view finder armrest Form Images : The image has material , shape , color or other elements that relate to the form of artifacts.  Instead of concepts and scenarios , the participants paid more attention to the identification of materials , shapes and colors of objects in the images , and the form of the artifacts . During the identification process , the participants also considered whether these concrete elements could bring value to the proposal . For the design topic of “a chair for adults to speculate , ” Participant 4 was inspired by the material displayed in the generated image , which brought him an Aha - moment . “The white stripes in the transparent chair , coupled with a little red grain , reminded me of glass marbles . Thinking of the crystal clear material and dispersion of marbles in the light , I imagined a chair with these materials . ” chair leg For the design topic of “a camera for children to play , ” participant 6 indicated that the protruding shapes on both sides of the strange Polaroid camera in the image reminded her of the lack of children ' s grip strength , and that it might be easier for children to hold the camera through this shape . In addition , after seeing the paw - like shapes in the generated images , she envisioned a camera that followed children like a pet , reminiscent of characters like Snoopy and Charlie Brown . This shape added character traits to the camera , which was included in the final design proposal . Marble chair 1950 Discussion In this study , we explored five noteworthy topics for discussion : “annotate to create , ” “AI in design process , ” “new learning opportunities for designers , ” “reinventing design methods with AI , ” and “problems of copyright and unequal distribution of resources . ” We aim to stimulate the attention and discussion of the human - AI interaction community regarding the relevant issues of collaboration between designers and AI . Annotate to Create  In this experiment , we discovered that Gaver ' s annotated portfolios , as proposed , made significant contributions to the collaborative process and exhibited new functionalities . Annotated portfolios transformed from a mere collection of design interpretations and concept extractions to a communication tool for designers to interact with AI . The act of " annotating " within the annotated portfolios also provided insights into the strategic direction of our communication with AI.   Gaver raised concerns regarding the logic of annotated portfolios , such as the functionality of the design , aesthetics , and user identities [ 6 ] . He and his colleagues also proposed annotation strategies , including trajectory and ecosystem [ 3 ] , to assist designers in understanding the essence of design artifacts , establishing databases , and recognizing various features of design space.  Although the insights provided by annotated portfolios initially focused on " enhancing human designers ' understanding , " they played a crucial role in this experiment , revealing the potential for annotated portfolios to facilitate mutual understanding between designers and AI . This finding leads us to reflect on how we can alter or extend the logic and strategies of annotated portfolios in the context of designer - AI collaboration , aiming to improve the co - creation process.   In addition , the act of annotation has opened up new directions for communication strategies . We envision that annotation can play a role in any collaborative task with AI . For instance , beyond image generation tasks , in the case of article writing where authors utilize chat - GPT to compose their articles , they can annotate example texts and organize the annotations for application in a text generator . Furthermore , we can imagine a scenario where AI performs the annotations , and humans are involved in the creative process by selecting annotations ( both annotated materials and those generated by AI ) . We look forward to future work delving deeper into this topic.  AI in Design Process  In this experiment , we investigated the collaboration between designers and AI in facilitating creative ideation . We also identified several directions for future research and encouraged exploring co - creation with AI in various design domains.  AI , as an organic and versatile medium , not only evolves rapidly in terms of functionality but also offers numerous undiscovered application possibilities for humans . To effectively collaborate with AI , it is important for image generators to provide more visual interfaces , adjustable parameters , and model result explanations to reduce the cost of human learning . Additionally , exploring how to effectively , meaningfully , and even playfully collaborate with AI would be an essential topic for further investigation . For instance , how can multidisciplinary design teams collaborate with AI ? What differences arise when incorporating AI into different stages of the design process?  The ever - changing landscape of AI provides opportunities to explore uncharted territories and uncover untapped potential . While this experiment focused on interactive design , we envision future explorations in graphic design , product design , architecture , and other design domains . Furthermore , we anticipate witnessing the application of AI - assisted design in rigorous industrial processes , leading to tangible outcomes . These will enable AI to make substantial contributions and demonstrate its value in the design field.  New Learning Opportunities for Designers  The rapid development of AI tools brings about pressures in resource allocation , but it also creates new learning opportunities for designers . Undoubtedly , AI tools significantly impact the design industry , and designers may feel unsettled to some extent , fearing unemployment , devaluation of their core skills , or changes in the industry structure , among other concerns . However , designers are not completely replaced . Rather , they face new learning opportunities.   Based on the results of this experiment , we suggest that designers focus on cultivating competence in taste and style . While image generators provide convenience and speed , the aesthetic appeal of the generated images is closely related to the operator ' s taste . Behind the taste lies excellent decision - making ability . We also recommend that designers cultivate curatorial skills through practice in decision - making , considering design as the culmination of a series of decisions.   Furthermore , current design education faces challenges , as existing materials and training may need adjustments in response to new AI tools . We should explore the significance and necessity of training in traditional techniques and engage in critical thinking regarding new tools . For example , what are the values of designers with strong hand - drawing skills versus those who excel in operating generators ? We invite design practitioners and researchers to collectively explore the AI era , the transformation of design capabilities , and the methods for enhancing essential skills.  Reinventing Design Methods with AI  In this experiment , we used the annotated portfolios method as an example and applied it to AI - assisted design . We could not help but wonder about the many other design methods that could be explored in collaboration with AI , such as using text generators to create personas , brainstorming with chatbots , and generating UI / UX interfaces based on affinity maps . The convergent and divergent tasks in design methods might also be well - suited for testing results in collaboration with AI . We look forward to more investigation in this field in the future . Problems of Copyright and Unequal Distribution of Resources  During our research process , we also contemplated the challenges and limitations of AI in copyright and resource allocation . AI has stirred up strong opposition within the creative community ( e . g . , ArtStation [ 23 ] , Hollywood screenwriters [ 1 ] ) . Many creators argue that using original works as training data for AI models is unethical and unjust for the creative community . This is because the original creators cannot benefit from AI tools , regardless of whether they agree to authorize their work , and they may even face competition from these tools . Discussions in forums have polarized , highlighting the complex copyright issues surrounding collaborative works with AI . This issue requires broader discussions and institutional regulations to ensure fairness for creators and establish reasonable usage boundaries . Emerging questions include : Who has the capability to use AI ? How should it be used ? Does it exacerbate class differences ? What impact does it have on achieving social justice ? These are all topics worthy of further exploration in the future . We anticipate that AI will bring more value to humanity . However , it is essential to safeguard the rights and interests of individuals and approach the impact of AI on the creative community with caution . 1951 Conclusion In this pictorial , we explored the possibilities of collaborative co - creation between AI and humans in the design field . Through the Research Through Design approach , six participants engaged in a structured exploration of the same system using the following steps : choosing a design topic , finding references and annotating them , classifying annotations , using a text - to - image generator , sketching a proposal , and drawing a workflow . Experimental data were collected through this process . Subsequently , the data were carefully reviewed , followed by semi - structured interviews and thematic analysis to obtain empirical understanding.   The design workflow created by the participants revealed that the image generator served as a support for divergent thinking and ideation within the design process . The degree of divergence in the generated images depended on the abstraction level of the prompts . More abstract prompts allowed for greater divergence , while specific images required detailed and precise descriptions . As for the annotated approach , the participants reported that it improved their efficiency and yielded more preferred results compared to using Midjourney without a pre - established database . Moreover , we observed diverse prompt strategies among the participants and witnessed dynamic adjustments between the designers and the generator , leading to mutual understanding and collaboration . Regarding the impact of image content on designers , we identified three themes : concept , scenario , and form , each facilitating different aspects of creativity for designers . We suggest that designers transform , apply , or merge these inspirations in their design proposals , expanding their role from creators to curator - like creators with more choices and arrangements.   Finally , we acknowledge the opportunities , challenges , and limitations of collaboration between creators and AI . Therefore , we presented five key themes for discussion : annotate to create , AI in design process , new learning opportunities for designers , reinventing design methods with AI , and problems of copyright and unequal distribution of resources . Taken together , we hope to stimulate dialogue within the HCI community and highlight the need for further experiential exploration , which is advantageous to understanding the real - world applications and requirements of co - creation between AI and designers.
