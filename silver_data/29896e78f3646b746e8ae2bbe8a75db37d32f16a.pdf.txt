Although much of the public health effort to combat coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) has focused on di - sease control strategies in public settings , transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) within households remains an important problem . The nature and determinants of household transmission are poorly understood . Methods . To address this gap , we gathered and analyzed data from 22 published and prepublished studies from 10 countries ( 20 291 household contacts ) that were available through 2 September 2020 . Our goal was to combine estimates of the SARS - CoV - 2 household secondary attack rate ( SAR ) and to explore variation in estimates of the household SAR . Results . The overall pooled random - effects estimate of the household SAR was 17 . 1 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 13 . 7 – 21 . 2 % ) . In study - level , random - effects meta - regressions stratified by testing frequency ( 1 test , 2 tests , > 2 tests ) , SAR estimates were 9 . 2 % ( 95 % CI , 6 . 7 – 12 . 3 % ) , 17 . 5 % ( 95 % CI , 13 . 9 – 21 . 8 % ) , and 21 . 3 % ( 95 % CI , 13 . 8 – 31 . 3 % ) , respectively . Household SARs tended to be higher among older adult contacts and among contacts of symptomatic cases . Conclusions . These findings suggest that SARs reported using a single follow - up test may be underestimated , and that testing household contacts of COVID - 19 cases on multiple occasions may increase the yield for identifying secondary cases . Keywords . SARS - CoV - 2 ; household transmission ; secondary attack ; testing frequency . Nonpharmaceutical interventions , such as social distancing and mask wearing , have shown considerable promise in reducing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) . However , such measures may be difficult to implement within households , where transmission remains an important challenge for disease control . Evidence regarding intrahousehold transmission dynamics is accumulating rapidly . Several primary studies and unpublished reviews have reported household secondary attack rates ( SARs ) for SARS - CoV - 2 that converge in the 15 – 19 % range [ 1 , 2 ] . Many of the primary studies were conducted in China , where household structure ( eg , a prevalence of multigenerational households ) and roles ( eg , allocation of responsibility for child or elder care ) may affect generalizability to other domestic set - tings . To date , systematic reviews have not examined the sen - sitivity of SAR estimates to study design features , such as the frequency of follow - up testing . Consequently , there are sub - stantial gaps in the understanding of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission within households , hampering the development of prevention policies and protocols . We reviewed and analyzed available studies of the house - hold SARs for SARS - CoV - 2 . The analysis addressed aspects of measurement and study design that are likely to influence the reported estimates , including details of follow - up and testing , cases and contacts , and geographic settings . Our goal was to muster the best available evidence on infection risk among people living with someone with SARS - CoV - 2 , both to aid de - velopment of optimal disease control policies and improve the accuracy of epidemic forecasts . In addition , we sought to iden - tify key gaps in existing evidence of the household SAR . METHODS Search Strategy And Selection Criteria We searched PubMed , bioRxiv , and medRxiv on 2 September 2020 for published and prepublished studies reporting SARS - CoV - 2 Household Transmission • cid 2021 : 73 ( Suppl 2 ) • S139 empirical estimates of household SARs for SARS - CoV - 2 . The search terms , which are reported in full in Figure 1 , paired vari - ants of the disease terminology ( eg , “SARS - CoV * , ” “COVID * ” ) with terms such as “household , ” “secondary attack , ” “family transmission , ” “family contact , ” and “indoor transmission . ” We considered only English - language records posted on or after 1 January 2019 . To identify papers that were clearly out of scope , we devel - oped a set of exclusionary and inclusionary keywords to screen out some papers on the basis of their titles alone ( Figure 1 ) . The exclusionary keywords were designed to eliminate mod - eling studies , and took precedence over inclusionary keywords . Eligible titles were reviewed at the abstract and full - text levels by 2 authors ( H . F . F . and L . M . ) , and the bibliographies of studies reviewed in full text were screened for additional papers related to the household SAR . Studies were included in the final sample if they met the following eligibility criteria : ( 1 ) they reported estimates of the Figure 1 . Study selection . Excluded records may have had more than 1 reason for exclusion , but only 1 reason was listed for each record . Records from bioRxiv and medRxiv that fell outside the 50 best matches were largely irrelevant ( eg , not related to SARS - CoV - 2 or examined the economic impact of the pandemic ) .

S140 • cid 2021 : 73 ( Suppl 2 ) • Fung et al household SAR or the data required to compute the household SAR ; ( 2 ) they comprised data from more than 1 household ; and ( 3 ) they tested—at a minimum—all symptomatic household contacts by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) . We reviewed the subset of included studies to estab - lish whether there was overlap in the study populations across multiple included studies . We employed more stringent eligi - bility criteria than existing reviews to mitigate sources of bias in our meta - analyses . For example , we excluded studies that did not test all symptomatic contacts , because they were likely to underestimate the household SAR . To minimize heteroge - neity in the case definition , we considered only studies that used RT - PCR testing , rather than antibody testing . The 2 reviewers ( H . F . F . and L . M . ) independently assessed the quality of each study using a modified 9 - point Newcastle - Ottawa scale for observational studies [ 3 ] . Specifically , each study was evaluated on the basis of 3 criteria : selection of parti - cipants ( 4 points ) , comparability of studies ( 1 point ) , and ascer - tainment of the outcome of interest ( 3 points ; Supplementary Table 1 ) . Studies that scored 7 points or higher were classified as high quality , those that scored 4 to 6 points as moderate quality , and those with 3 or fewer points as low quality . The 2 reviewers discussed discrepancies in their scores and jointly reevaluated the relevant studies to reach consensus . Study Definitions We defined “household contacts” as people living in the same residence as the index case , and the “household SAR” as the per - centage of all household contacts who were reported to have tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 by RT - PCR . Definitions of an “index case” came from the studies themselves , and were de - fined as either the first case to be confirmed in a household or the confirmed case with the earliest date of symptom onset . Such definitions run the risk of misclassifying asymptomatic index cases as secondary cases . Data Analysis All analyses were performed in R version 3 . 6 . 1 ( R Foundation for Statistical Computing ) . We computed exact binomial confi - dence intervals for SAR estimates reported without uncertainty through the “Hmisc” package . We used random - and mixed - effects binomial - normal models ( “metafor” package ) to gen - erate pooled estimates of the household SAR , and quantified the residual heterogeneity between studies using the I 2 statistic . A P value of < . 05 was considered statistically significant . We did not account for household clustering , as the studies rarely reported the data needed for these calculations . RESULTS We found 826 papers from our multi - database search and 2 additional papers from the bibliographies of studies reviewed in full text , yielding 828 papers in total . Of these , 585 were excluded at the title review stage and 186 were excluded after abstract review ( Figure 1 ) . After conducting full - text reviews of the remaining 57 papers , we identified a final set of 22 papers that met our eligibility criteria . Of these , 20 papers were pub - lished and 2 were unpublished ; 6 papers reported results of pro - spective studies and 16 reported retrospective studies . The number of household contacts evaluated per study ranged from 11 to 10 592 ( Table 1 ; Figure 2 ) . We classified 4 of the studies as high quality ; 14 as moderate quality ; and 4 as low quality ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Half ( 11 ) of the studies analyzed households in China [ 4 – 14 ] ; the rest analyzed house - holds in South Korea [ 15 , 16 ] , Taiwan [ 17 ] , Singapore [ 18 ] , Brunei [ 19 ] , Israel [ 20 ] , Germany [ 21 ] , the Netherlands [ 22 ] , the United States [ 23 , 24 ] , and Australia [ 25 ] . The testing cri - teria were largely congruent across studies : 19 of the 22 studies tested all household contacts regardless of symptoms . Of the China - based studies , 6 examined households in Guangdong province [ 7 – 9 , 11 , 12 , 14 ] ; the cohorts used in these studies did not overlap ( personal communication , Guangdong Provincial Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) . The households followed in the 2 studies from South Korea [ 15 , 16 ] were not discrete : SY Park et al [ 15 ] used a subcohort of the cohort used in YJ Park et al [ 16 ] . Nevertheless , we chose to in - clude the smaller study in our sample because it reported infor - mation that the larger study did not ( namely , household SAR by index case symptoms ) , but we excluded it from analyses of the overall household SAR . The 2 studies from Wuhan , China [ 4 , 5 ] , recruited index cases from different hospitals and were considered distinct populations . The study from Singapore [ 18 ] focused on pediatric household contacts ( ≤16 years ) , and was included in our analysis only for the purpose of examining how the household SAR varied by age of contact . In total , the 22 studies considered 20 291 household con - tacts , 3151 ( 15 . 5 % ) of whom tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . Household SAR estimates ranged from 3 . 9 % in the Northern Territory , Australia [ 25 ] , to 36 . 4 % in Shandong , China [ 6 ] ( Figure 2 ) . The overall pooled random - effects estimate of SAR was 17 . 1 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 13 . 7 – 21 . 2 % ) , with significant heterogeneity ( P < . 0001 ; Supplementary Table 2 ) . Excluding the 2 unpublished studies had little effect on the pooled SAR estimate ( 16 . 8 % ; 95 % CI , 13 . 4 – 20 . 8 % ; Supplementary Table 2 ) . Similarly , study timing , operational - ized as the enrollment start date , was not significantly related to SAR estimates ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Next , we computed SAR estimates by region to explore ge - ographic differences . The SAR estimates were 18 . 1 % ( 95 % CI , 14 . 2 – 22 . 8 % ) , 13 . 5 % ( 95 % CI , 7 . 2 – 23 . 9 % ) , and 17 . 4 % ( 95 % CI , 9 . 7 – 29 . 4 ) for China , Asian countries outside of China , and countries outside of Asia , respectively ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . The pooled estimate tended to be higher among studies that defined the index case by symptom onset date ( 21 . 0 % ; 95 % CI , 14 . 9 – 28 . 8 % ) than among studies that defined the index SARS - CoV - 2 Household Transmission • cid 2021 : 73 ( Suppl 2 ) • S141 Tab l e 1 .

The amount of residual heterogeneity , as measured by the I 2 statistic , decreased from 96 . 7 % to 91 . 2 % after accounting for follow - up duration and testing frequency , suggesting these study features were important determinants of the household SAR estimates ( Supplementary Table 2 ; Table 1 ) . Between - study variation could not be explained by differences in study quality ( I 2 was 96 . 5 % when study quality was included as a moderator variable ; Supplementary Table 2 ) . Estimates of the household SAR were lower , on average , in studies with less frequent testing of contacts . Random - effects regressions stratified by frequency of follow - up testing revealed that studies with > 2 follow - up tests of contacts reported an av - erage household SAR of 21 . 3 % ( 95 % CI , 13 . 8 – 31 . 3 % ) , whereas those with 2 follow - up tests averaged 17 . 5 % ( 95 % CI , 13 . 9 – 21 . 8 % ) and those with a single follow - up test averaged 9 . 2 % ( 95 % CI , 6 . 7 – 12 . 3 % ; Supplementary Table 2 ) . The household SARs were higher among adults and older adults than among children , and higher among female contacts and contacts of symptomatic cases ( Tables 2 – 5 ; Supplementary Figure ) . SARs were also elevated among spouses or significant others of index cases relative to nonspouse household members ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . There were 2 studies that reported the household SAR by age of the index case ( Table 3 ) . In the study from Qingdao , China [ 13 ] , the household SAR was higher when index cases were 55 years or older than when cases were younger than 55 years ( Table 3 ) . In South Korea [ 16 ] , the household SAR was highest for index cases aged 10 – 19 years ( 18 . 6 % ; 95 % CI , 14 . 0 – 24 . 0 % ) and lowest for those younger than 9 ( 5 . 3 % ; 95 % CI , 1 . 3 – 13 . 7 % ) ; by comparison , the SAR estimates for adult age groups ranged from 7 . 0 to 18 . 0 % ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . There are a number of additional factors that could have influenced household SAR estimates , including mask use and index case severity . A small subset of the studies con - sidered these factors , and their findings are summarized in Supplementary Table 5 . DISCUSSION While much of the public health effort in controlling SARS - CoV - 2 has appropriately focused on preventing community transmission , people who reside with infected individuals are an important group ; they are at substantial risk of infection due to prolonged , close contact . Available estimates of the SAR within households vary widely , and the determinants of trans - mission risk , including age of index cases and contacts , are Figure 2 . Estimates of the household secondary attack rate , stratified by country and study design . Exact binomial confidence intervals were computed for estimates re - ported without uncertainty . SARS - CoV - 2 Household Transmission • cid 2021 : 73 ( Suppl 2 ) • S143 only beginning to be understood . In this review of studies to date , we calculated a household SAR of 17 . 1 % ( 95 % CI , 13 . 7 – 21 . 2 % ) . Importantly , we observed considerable heterogeneity in household SAR estimates , and there appeared to be system - atic variation according to identifiable aspects of study design . In particular , studies that tested contacts more frequently tended to generate larger SARs . This suggests that studies with less intensive testing may have missed cases and underestimated the household SAR . Other aspects of study design and setting are likely to contribute to variation in the observed estimates ; they include approaches to case selection , how quickly symp - tomatic index and secondary cases were detected , the timing of testing , and the phase of the epidemic . Although only a minority of studies reported household SARs by contact age , the available evidence suggests that the es - timates are sensitive to this variable . Most of these studies found higher SARs among adults than children . Whether this is due to differential susceptibility to infection or differential exposure to the index case is not yet clear for SARS - CoV - 2 , but the higher SARs in children for other respiratory viruses ( such as 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza [ 26 , 27 ] ) suggests that differential exposure is unlikely to fully explain these discrepancies . Other hypotheses for lower household SARs among children ( and asymptomatic contacts ) include lower viral loads , leading to low sensitivity of RT - PCR tests , or a lower probability of testing . Our review identified only a few studies that examined the relationships between household SAR and the age and sympto - matic status of the index case . While results suggest that index cases who are young children ( between 0 and 9 years ) and index cases who are asymptomatic may have lower household SARs , further studies are critically needed to clarify the effects of age and symptoms of cases on household transmission risks . Other characteristics of households and household members—including some that were not observed or reported in existing studies—are likely to affect the household SAR , and explain some of the substantial heterogeneity in reported es - timates . The number of cohabitants and the density of living conditions ( eg , number of household members per room ) are almost certainly influential . Relatedly , there are likely influences based on isolation and prevention practices within the house - hold : both what is feasible and the extent to which feasible op - tions are pursued . For example , the study based in Bnei Brak , Israel [ 20 ] , followed a cohort of households with relatively large numbers of cohabitants living in a close - knit community ; these factors plausibly contributed to the study’s reported household SAR of 32 . 1 % ( 95 % CI , 30 . 4 – 33 . 9 % ) , which was at the high end of all estimates in our sample . Furthermore , mask use within households is likely to be protective , but only 1 study [ 8 ] strat - ified the household SAR by index case mask use . Additional studies are required to elucidate the effects of masks on house - hold transmission . Lastly , the index case severity and the timing of testing are likely determinants of transmission potential . Few studies , however , considered these factors in the context of household SAR . The main limitations of our analysis spring from limitations in available data and studies , though much has been accom - plished in understanding a pandemic that has raged for less than a year . In particular , caution must be taken in generalizing summary statistics , like household SARs , across countries and regions . Household size and composition , contact patterns , and Table 3 .

S144 • cid 2021 : 73 ( Suppl 2 ) • Fung et al testing and isolation practices all vary substantially geographi - cally . None of the included studies come from South Asia , Latin America , or Africa , although these places account for a substan - tial proportion of the global caseload [ 28 ] . This review suggests there is a critical need for studies in these regions to investigate whether there are setting - specific differences that influence the household SAR . The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic has been devastating , and many countries are working actively to formulate effective strategies for containment . While preventing spread in congregate public settings is a critical first step , a full - fledged strategy for reducing transmission must also involve interventions to prevent transmission within households [ 29 , 30 ] . Such interventions have begun to take place in some set - tings and may include early case detection , isolation of cases , systematic investigation and quarantine of exposed household contacts , and the development and use of effective postexposure chemoprophylaxis among exposed household members [ 31 ] . Design and implementation of these strategies—including pri - oritization of cases and contacts who pose and face the greatest risk—should be informed by a better understanding of the ex - tent , nature , and determinants of transmission in households .
