Resolving the similarities and differences between the effect of structurally different actin - binding proteins on the thermodynamic properties of G - actin Veronika Taka´cs - Kolla´r 1 • Miklo´s Nyitrai 1 , 2 , 3 • De´nes L } orinczy 1 • Ga´bor Hild 1 , 4 Received : 16 October 2016 / Accepted : 14 November 2016 / Published online : 23 November 2016 (cid:2) Akade´miai Kiado´ , Budapest , Hungary 2016 Abstract Differential scanning calorimetry was applied to compare the effects of mammalian twinﬁlin - 1 or toxoﬁlin on the thermodynamic properties of actin monomer . Although twinﬁlin and toxoﬁlin have different structure and actin - binding sites , they similarly increased the ther - modynamic stability of monomeric actin . The mammalian twinﬁlin increased , while the toxoﬁlin did not signiﬁcantly change the T 1 / 2 value ( the width at half - height of the transition peak ) during the complex formation between the actin and the monomer binding proteins . In case of tox - oﬁlin , the E A value ( activation energy ) signiﬁcantly increased compared to twinﬁlin where the activation energy was nearly insensitive to the complex formation . It seems that toxoﬁlin can achieve its main function as an actin monomer sequestering protein by more effectively and consistently modifying the basic thermodynamic properties of the monomeric actin . Keywords Actin (cid:2) DSC (cid:2) Mouse twinﬁlin - 1 (cid:2) Toxoﬁlin Introduction Actin is one of the most important components of cytoskeleton which determines many processes in cells and as an essential part of the skeletal muscle that transmits force from the myosin ﬁlaments . Actin exists in monomeric ( G - actin ) and / or ﬁlamentous ( F - actin ) form and has large number of interacting partners [ 1 – 4 ] . Major functions of actin are regulated by actin - binding proteins . The thermo - dynamic properties of actin monomer were investigated with thermoanalytical techniques before . These studies revealed that the thermodynamic properties of G - actin depend largely on the bound ions and nucleotides [ 5 – 7 ] . The actin - binding proteins can efﬁciently adjust the ther - modynamic stability of actin [ 8 – 10 ] . Twinﬁlins are * 40 kDa proteins composed of two ADF ( actin - depolymerising factor ) —homologue domains con - nected by a short linker region plus a C - terminal tail . They are evolutionarily conserved actin - binding proteins that exist from yeast to mammals [ 11 ] . During the complex formation , the ratio of actin – twinﬁlin is 1 : 1 although they have two potential actin - binding sites . Twinﬁlin can bind between actin subdomains 1 and 3 based on the crystal structure of twinﬁlin’s C - terminal ADF - H domain in complex with G - actin [ 12 ] . Twinﬁlins are actin monomer binding and sequestering proteins and inhibit actin ﬁlament assembly by inhibiting the nucleotide exchange on actin monomers [ 11 , 13 ] . Like ADF / coﬁlin , twinﬁlin binds ADP – G - actin ( K D = 0 . 05 l M ) with * tenfold higher afﬁnity than ATP – G - actin ( K D = 0 . 47 l M ) under physiological ionic condi - tions [ 14 ] . Twinﬁlins have only one isoform in unicellular organism and invertebrates , and three isoforms ( twinﬁlin - 1 , twinﬁlin - 2a and twinﬁlin - 2b ) are in mammals [ 15 , 16 ] . Toxoﬁlin is a 27 kDa protein that is able to bind to actin monomer ( K D = 2 . 3 l M ) and to the ends of actin ﬁlaments & De´nes L } orinczy denes . lorinczy @ aok . pte . hu & Ga´bor Hild gabor . hild @ aok . pte . hu 1 Department of Biophysics , University of Pe´cs , Medical School , Szigeti Str . 12 , Pe´cs 7624 , Hungary 2 Szenta´gothai Research Center , Ifju´sa´g Str . 34 , Pe´cs 7624 , Hungary 3 MTA - PTE Nuclear - Mitochondrial Interactions Research Group , Szigeti Str . 12 , Pe´cs 7624 , Hungary 4 Department of Radiology , University of Pe´cs , Medical School , Ifju´sa´g Str . 13 , Pe´cs 7624 , Hungary 123 J Therm Anal Calorim ( 2017 ) 127 : 1261 – 1266 DOI 10 . 1007 / s10973 - 016 - 5968 - 7 as well [ 17 , 18 ] . Toxoﬁlin has three independent actin - binding regions and forms a ternary complex with an antiparallel actin dimer . This toxoﬁlin – actin complex can bind to the barbed end of the actin ﬁlaments [ 19 ] . Toxoﬁlin decreases the nucleotide exchange on G - actin and the actin polymerisation rate [ 18 , 19 ] . Presumably , toxoﬁlin disin - tegrates the cytoskeleton of host cells hereby increases the ratio of actin monomers [ 19 ] . In this study , our aim was to characterise and compare the effects of mouse twinﬁlin - 1 and toxoﬁlin on the thermal unfolding of Ca – G - actin . Although they have very different crystal structure , the two actin - binding proteins show many similarities in their effects on actin monomer . Both twinﬁlin and toxoﬁlin inhibit the nucleotide exchange on G - actin [ 16 , 19 – 21 ] , and in the presence of twinﬁlin or toxoﬁlin , the nucleotide binding cleft is shifted to a closed conformational state [ 20 , 21 ] . Here , we present a comprehensive study about the details behind the effect of twinﬁlin and toxoﬁlin on the thermodynamic properties of Ca – ATP – G - actin . Materials and methods Chemicals MOPS [ 3 - ( N - morpholino ) propanesulfonic acid ] , Tris – HCl , NaCl , CaCl 2 , MgCl 2 , imidazole , Luria broth medium , 2X YT Microbial Medium EZMix TM Powder , ampicillin , kanamycin , IPTG ( isopropyl – b - D - thiogalactopyranoside ) , sucrose and thrombin were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( Budapest , Hungary ) . ATP ( adenosine - 5 0 - triphosphate ) , MEA ( mercap - toethanol ) , DTT ( dithiothreitol ) and NaN 3 ( sodium azide ) were supplied by Merck ( Budapest , Hungary ) . Sample preparation Acetone - dried muscle powder was purchased from rabbit skeletal muscle as was described earlier by Feuer et al . [ 22 ] . The calcium bound actin monomer was prepared according to the method of Spudich and Watt modiﬁed by Mossakowska et al . [ 23 ] , and Spudich and Watt [ 24 ] . The G - actin was stored in buffer A ( 4 mM Tris – HCl , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM MEA and 0 . 005 % NaN 3 ) at pH 8 . 0 . The G - actin concentration was deﬁned spec - trophotometrically with a Jasco V - 550 spectrophotometer by using the absorption coefﬁcient of 1 . 11 mg mL - 1 cm - 1 at 280 nm [ 25 ] . The relative molecular mass of 42 , 300 Da was applied for G - actin [ 26 ] . During the whole study , Ca – ATP – G - actin was used in the experiments . His - tagged mammalian twinﬁlin - 1 and toxoﬁlin were obtained in Escherichia coli expression system as we described earlier [ 20 , 21 ] . His - tagged twinﬁlin construct was grown in Luria broth medium in the presence of 100 l g mL - 1 ampicilin until the OD of the culture at 600 nm reached 0 . 6 . After induction with 0 . 2 mM iso - propyl - b - D - thiogalactopyranoside , the expression was per - formed for 3 h at 37 (cid:3) C . In the next step , the collected cells were lysed , and the supernatant was puriﬁed in three steps . Nickel - nitrilotriacetic acid - agarose column ( Qiagen ) , Q - Sepharose anion - exchange column and Superdex - 75 HiLoad gel ﬁltration column ( GE Healthcare ) were applied to reach the puriﬁed proteins . Puriﬁed twinﬁlins were stored in 10 mM Tris buffer ( pH 7 . 5 ) with 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT at - 70 (cid:3) C . In case of toxoﬁlin , the actin - binding fragment , amino acids 69 – 196 , was used . Tox - oﬁlin 69 – 196 was grown in 2X YT Microbial Medium EZMix TM Powder in the presence of 30 l g mL - 1 kana - mycin and induced by 1 mM IPTG and performed for overnight at 20 (cid:3) C . The clariﬁed cell lysated was puriﬁed in two steps . At ﬁrst , a nickel - nitrilotriacetic acid - agarose column ( Qiagen , Hungary ) was applied . In the next step , His - tag was removed by digestion with thrombin at 4 (cid:3) C overnight . The concentrated protein loaded onto a Super - dex - 75 HiLoad gel ﬁltration column ( GE Healthcare ) to remove thrombin and the cleaved His - tag peptides . Tox - oﬁlin 69 – 196 was stored in 50 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 3 ) , 50 mM NaCl , 5 mM DTT and 3 % sucrose at - 70 (cid:3) C . Proteins concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically , using the molar extinction coefﬁcient of 39 , 100 M - 1 cm - 1 for twinﬁlin and 4470 M - 1 cm - 1 for toxoﬁlin determined with the ProtParam tool . DSC measurements The thermal unfolding of the G - actin and actin treated with twinﬁlin or toxoﬁlin samples was monitored by SETARAM Micro DSC - II calorimeter . All experiments were conducted between 0 and 100 (cid:3) C . The heating rate was 0 . 3 K min - 1 in all cases . Conventional Hastelloy batch vessels were used during the denaturation experi - ments with 850 l L sample volume in average . Reference sample was normal actin buffer prepared with MOPS . The sample and reference vessels were equilibrated with a precision of ± 0 . 1 mg , so there was no need for any heat capacity correction between the sample and refer - ence . The repeated scan of denatured sample was used as baseline reference , which was subtracted from the orig - inal DSC curve . Calculating the activation energy of thermal denaturation The method of Sanchez - Ruiz et al . [ 27 ] was applied before to explore the activation energy requirement of the pro - tein’s thermal denaturation . The analysis was based on the model of Lumry and Eyring [ 28 ] whose model was 1262 V . Taka´cs - Kolla´r et al . 123 previously efﬁciently used to explore the thermodynamic properties of muscle proteins [ 7 , 29 , 30 ] . They interpreted the irreversible protein denaturation process with a two - step kinetic model where a reversible denaturation step is followed by an irreversible phase : N ! k þ 1 k (cid:3) 1 D (cid:3) ! k 2 I ð 1 Þ where N is the natural , D is the reversibly denatured , while I is the irreversibly denatured form of the protein . The k ? 1 and k - 1 are the forward and backward rate constants of the reversible , while the k 2 is the forward rate constant of the irreversible step . Useful thermodynamic information can be achieved about the reversible unfolding of the protein if k 2 is much smaller compared to the outcome of the reversible step or when the irreversible denaturation is achieved at a different temperature than the melting temperature ( T m ) of the thermodynamic conversion of the protein . The activation energy of the protein denaturation can be related to the calorimetric enthalpy change through the following equation : ln ln dH cal dH cal (cid:3) dH (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:3) ¼ E A R 1 T m (cid:3) 1 T (cid:2) (cid:3) ð 2 Þ where dH cal is the total calorimetric enthalpy change in the denaturation , the dH is the calorimetric enthalpy change until the T temperature point , T m is the melting temperature of the denaturation , E A is the activation energy and R is the universal gas constant ( 8 . 314 J mol - 1 K - 1 ) . Results and discussion Actin is highly sensitive for the physico - chemical changes in its environment [ 2 , 31 – 37 ] . The change in the dynamics of actin due to different effectors can have a substantial effect on the functionality of cells . The actin - binding pro - teins can efﬁciently affect the basic dynamics and structure of actin [ 1 – 3 , 8 , 10 , 38 – 41 ] . The most frequently seen effect of actin monomer binding proteins on the dynamics of actin is the increase in the thermodynamic stability of the actin monomers [ 2 , 8 , 10 , 21 , 39 ] . In the present work , the Ca – G - actin was characterised thermodynamically with DSC technique . Also , the Mg – G - actin is thought to be a more physiological species ; it was indicated before that under certain conditions at some parts of cells calcium - actin pools may be present transiently , and this pool can affect the function of the actin cytoskeleton locally [ 42 ] . The main thermodynamic quantity that was studied so far is the melting temperature ( T m ) of the actin monomers . In our study , we further investigated the basic changes behind the complex formation between the actin and two representatives of actin - binding proteins , the twinﬁlin and toxoﬁlin . In the present measurements , the mammalian twinﬁlin - 1 and the toxoﬁlin69 – 196 fragment were used as the binding partner of actin monomers . As the main activities of the toxoﬁlin ( monomer sequestration and barbed - end capping ) can be associated with the applied toxoﬁlin69 – 196 fragment , it is reasonable to think that studying this part can give valuable information about the function of the whole protein as well . Beside the melting temperature , the T 1 / 2 ( the denaturating temperature width at half - height of the of the heat ﬂow at the transition peak ) and the activation energy were also studied to explore the fundamental changes behind the main thermodynamic changes induced by the actin monomer binding proteins on actin . The 23 l M Ca – G - actin exhibited a usual unfolding transition at around 56 (cid:3) C , while the pure 23 l M twinﬁlin at 54 (cid:3) C ( Fig . 1 ) . In case of the un - complexed twinﬁlin at around 63 (cid:3) C , an exothermal transition can be seen that should be clariﬁed in further studies . The T m value for the actin monomer is in good agreement with our previous results [ 8 ] . The complex of the 23 l M Ca – G - actin with 23 l M twinﬁlin resulted a single transition peak with a shifted T m value to 59 (cid:3) C , suggesting a thermodynamically stable Ca – G - actin – twinﬁlin complex compared to the un - complex actin monomers . Considering that the K D value is 0 . 12 ± 0 . 04 l M for the Ca – G - actin – twinﬁlin complex , approximately 93 % of actin ( 21 . 4 l M ) was in complex with twinﬁlin - 1 during the DSC measurements [ 21 ] . The T 1 / 2 values of the heat denaturation curves are deﬁned as 45 40 50 55 60 65 70 75 Temperature / °C H ea t f l o w / m W 0 . 005 0 . 000 – 0 . 005 – 0 . 010 – 0 . 015 – 0 . 020 59 °C 54 °C 56 °C endo 23 µ M twinfilin Effect of twinfilin 23 µ M G - actin + 23 µ M twinfilin 23 µ M G - actin Fig . 1 Thermal denaturation curve of Ca – G - actin alone and in complex with twinﬁlin .

The melting temperature ( T m ) is 56 (cid:3) C for the Ca – G - actin , 54 (cid:3) C for twinﬁlin and 59 (cid:3) C for the Ca – G - actin – twinﬁlin complex Resolving the similarities and differences between the effect of structurally … 1263 123 the width of the transition peak at its half - height value . The T 1 / 2 values were used to get information about the coop - erativity of the melting of actin [ 43 ] . The T 1 / 2 of 4 . 76 K of Ca – G - actin shifted to 5 . 8 K as the Ca – G - actin formed a complex with twinﬁlin . The 22 % increase in the T 1 / 2 can suggest that the cooperativity during the phase transition is smaller for the actin - binding protein bound actin monomers compared to the un - complexed ones . The activation energy of the phase transitions were also calculated for the Ca – G - actin and the twinﬁlin as well by using Eq . 2 ( Fig . 1 ) . The calculated E A value for Ca – G - actin is 372 kJ mol - 1 . This value is a bit higher than the calculated values of others ( 200 – 290 kJ mol - 1 ) [ 44 ] , but it can be due to the different methods that were used ( DNase I - inhibition assay vs DSC ) . The calculated E A value for Ca – G - actin – twinﬁlin complex was 355 kJ mol - 1 ( Fig . 3 ) . This small 4 . 6 % decrease in the activation energy may suggest that in case of the actin – twinﬁlin complex , a little bit less energy is needed to initiate the denaturation process than in the case of the un - complexed Ca - bound actin monomers . In the case of toxoﬁlin ( Fig . 2 ) , the T m value for the free toxoﬁlin was 53 . 1 (cid:3) C ( experimental not shown ) , and the denaturation temperature of the Ca – G - actin complex is around 64 (cid:3) C . The change in T m for the Ca – G - actin – tox - oﬁlin complex similarly to twinﬁlin suggest that the actin monomers got into a thermodynamically more stable state due to the complex formation with the actin monomer binding protein . Considering that the K D value is 4 . 1 ± 1 . 7 l M for the Ca – G - actin – toxoﬁlin complex , approximately 47 % of actin ( 14 . 1 l M ) was in complex with toxoﬁlin during the DSC measurements . The T 1 / 2 decreased about 4 % due to the Ca – G - actin – toxoﬁlin complex formation which suggest that the cooperativity during the phase transition of actin was insensitive for the presence of toxoﬁlin . The calculated activation energy for Ca – G - actin – toxoﬁlin complex is 449 kJ mol - 1 ( Fig . 3 ) . The 21 % increase in the E A may suggest that for the actin – toxoﬁlin complex more energy is needed to initiate the denaturation process than in the case of the un - complexed Ca - bound monomeric actin . Conclusions The actin - binding proteins can effectively modify the dynamics and structure of actin [ 1 – 3 , 8 , 10 , 38 – 41 ] . The thermodynamic stability of actin monomers in their com - plex with the actin monomer binding proteins is usually increased [ 2 , 8 , 10 , 21 , 39 ] . In the present study , beside the melting temperature ( T m ) , the T 1 / 2 and the activation energy ( E A ) were also studied to explore the detailed thermodynamic changes behind the complex formation between two representatives of the actin monomer binding proteins and G - actin . The mammalian twinﬁlin - 1 shifted the T m value from 56 to 59 (cid:3) C while the relative increase in T 1 / 2 was around 22 % and the E A value decreased by 17 kJ mol - 1 during the complex formation with the mammalian Ca – G - actin . The toxoﬁlin from a parasitic protozoan ( Toxoplasma gondii ) shifted the T m to 64 (cid:3) C while the relative decrease of T 1 / 2 was around 4 % and the E A value increased by 94 kJ mol - 1 during the complex formation with the mammalian Ca – G - actin .

The complex between the monomer binding proteins and actin responded less cooperatively to the thermal denaturation than the un - complexed actin monomers in case of twinﬁlin . The E A values indicate that to initiate and drive the thermal denaturation of the actin – actin - binding protein complex , more energy is needed in case of the toxoﬁlin than twinﬁlin . It was suggested before that the closed conformation of the nucleotide binding cleft can be related to the increased thermal stability of G - actin [ 8 ] . As the nucleotide binding cleft of actin is shifted to a closed conformation in the presence of toxoﬁlin and twinﬁlin [ 20 , 21 ] , it is reasonable to assume that this closed conformational state can con - tribute to the increased thermodynamic stability of mono - meric actin in the presence of the investigated actin - binding proteins . Based on the presented data , it seems that a protozoan originated actin monomer binding protein can achieve its main function as an actin monomer sequestering protein by more effectively and consistently modifying the basic thermodynamic properties of the monomeric actin .
