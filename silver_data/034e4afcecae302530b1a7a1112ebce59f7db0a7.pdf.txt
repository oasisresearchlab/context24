ARTICLE Dual clathrin and integrin signaling systems regulate growth factor receptor activation Marco A . Alfonzo - Méndez 1 , Kem A . Sochacki 1 , Marie - Paule Strub 1 & Justin W . Taraska 1 ✉ The crosstalk between growth factor and adhesion receptors is key for cell growth and migration . In pathological settings , these receptors are drivers of cancer . Yet , how growth and adhesion signals are spatially organized and integrated is poorly understood . Here we use quantitative ﬂ uorescence and electron microscopy to reveal a mechanism where ﬂ at clathrin lattices partition and activate growth factor signals via a coordinated response that involves crosstalk between epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and the adhesion receptor β 5 - integrin . We show that ligand - activated EGFR , Grb2 , Src , and β 5 - integrin are captured by clathrin coated - structures at the plasma membrane . Clathrin structures dramatically grow in response to EGF into large ﬂ at plaques and provide a signaling platform that link EGFR and β 5 - integrin through Src - mediated phosphorylation . Disrupting this EGFR / Src / β 5 - integrin axis prevents both clathrin plaque growth and dampens receptor signaling . Our study reveals a reciprocal regulation between clathrin lattices and two different receptor systems to coor - dinate and enhance signaling . These ﬁ ndings have broad implications for the regulation of growth factor signaling , adhesion , and endocytosis . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 28373 - x OPEN 1 Biochemistry and Biophysics Center , National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute , National Institutes of Health , 50 South Drive , Building 50 , Bethesda , MD 20892 , USA . ✉ email : justin . taraska @ nih . gov NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2022 ) 13 : 905 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 28373 - x | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; C ellular communication begins with a cascade of molecular interactions initiated by plasma membrane ( PM ) receptors of which the receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) are one of the major superfamilies . RTKs are ubiquitous integral membrane proteins in eukaryotes that perform numerous actions including the regulation of proliferation , differentiation , survival , and migration 1 . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is one of the most widely studied members of the RTK superfamily and regulates epithelial tissue development and homeostasis . In lung , breast , and head and neck cancers , EGFR is a primary driver of tumorigenesis and a major target for therapy 2 . EGFR spans the plasma membrane and contains a ligand - interacting domain facing the extracellular space and a tyrosine kinase domain in the cytoplasm 3 . The binding of EGF to EGFR triggers receptor dimerization and cross - phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within its cytosolic domain 4 . This provides docking sites for the recruitment of scaffold proteins including Grb2 , and the activa - tion of downstream tyrosine kinases such as ERK and Src 5 , 6 . 0 2 5 15 30 60 min EGF dome flat sphere 0 2 5 15 30 60 0 2 5 15 30 60 0 2 5 15 30 60 time ( min ) s i z e ( n m ² x 10 00 ) 0 100 200 300 i EGF m e m b r ane a r ea o cc upa t i on ( % ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 EGF 0 0 2 5 15 30 60 0 2 5 15 30 60 time ( min ) 0 2 5 15 30 60 Ctrl EGF 0 min EGF 15 min a c e f b d g h j k ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 28373 - x 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2022 ) 13 : 905 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 28373 - x | www . nature . com / naturecommunications The EGFR pathway can be activated either directly by its cognate ligands or through transactivation by other signaling proteins including integrins 7 , 8 . Integrins are adhesion molecules that are responsible for cell – cell and cell – matrix interactions , and relay mechanical sig - nals bidirectionally between the extracellular space and the cytoplasm 9 . In this way , integrins sense the local environment and control tissue rigidity , cell growth , and movement 10 . Dysre - gulation of integrin signaling contributes to cancer and metastasis 11 . Integrins are heterodimers of α and β subunits , each containing a large multidomain extracellular region ( > 700 resi - dues ) for ligand binding , a single transmembrane helix , and a short cytoplasmic tail ( 13 – 70 residues ) 12 . β - integrin cytoplasmic tails lack enzymatic activity . Instead , they harbor distinct reg - ulatory sequences including two NPxY motifs ( Asn - Pro - x - Tyr ) that can be phosphorylated 13 . NPxY motifs have a high af ﬁ nity for phosphotyrosine - binding domain proteins 14 . This allows them to bind to partners including clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) accessory proteins 15 , 16 . While these proteins are known to interact generally , how they are dynamically and spatially orga - nized at the PM to control signaling and crosstalk is unclear . EGFR and integrins can be regulated through CME — the main endocytic pathway used by eukaryotic cells to internalize recep - tors into the cytoplasm 17 . During CME , clathrin and adapters assemble to bend the membrane into Ω - shaped pits 18 , 19 . Scission of clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) from the PM yields closed sphe - rical vesicles with an average diameter of ~ 100 nm 20 . Besides CCPs , cells exhibit a subset of clathrin coats known as ﬂ at clathrin lattices ( FCLs ) or plaques 21 . In contrast to CCPs , FCLs are long - lived on the PM and display a variety of two - dimensional shapes 22 , 23 . FCLs are abundant in myocytes and can bind cortical actin during muscle formation and function 24 . FCLs are also important for the adhesion between osteoclasts and bone 25 , 26 . During cell communication , different types of receptors including EGFR are clustered at FCLs 27 , 28 . Additionally , FCLs are enriched with β 5 - integrin 29 – 31 . Yet , it is unknown how ﬂ at clathrin lattices are regulated and their general functions remain unclear . Fur - thermore , the signaling pathways responsible for their initiation , growth , maintenance , and disassembly are unknown . Here , we identi ﬁ ed an EGFR / β 5 - integrin / Src signaling axis that regulates ﬂ at clathrin lattice expansion during growth factor sti - mulation . Using a combination of quantitative ﬂ uorescence and electron microscopy , we showed that EGF triggers large ultra - structural changes to the membrane of human squamous carci - noma ( HSC3 ) cells . These changes include the generation and dramatic expansion of large FCLs and required EGFR activation by EGF as well as Src kinase and β 5 - integrin . Agonist stimulation leads to persistent recruitment of EGFR , Grb2 , and β 5 - integrin into clathrin structures , and a corresponding loss of Src kinase . We provide evidence of β 5 - integrin phosphorylation mediated by Src that regulates this signaling domain . These data reveal a mutual regulation of FCLs and two different receptor systems : EGFR and β 5 - integrins . Thus , an EGFR / β 5 - integrin / Src axis contributes to the expansion of FCLs , which in turn act as dynamic signaling platforms to partition and enhance growth factor signaling at the adherent plasma membrane of human cells . Results EGF triggers changes in the ultrastructure of FCLs . First , we tracked the ultrastructure of clathrin at the plasma membrane during growth factor stimulation . To accomplish this , we used genome - edited HSC3 cells endogenously expressing EGFR tagged with GFP , an established model to study EGFR endocytosis and human EGFR - dependent head and neck carcinoma 32 – 34 . We plated HSC3 cells on collagen - coated glass , grew them for 2 days , starved , and stimulated them with vehicle ( Ctrl ) or EGF for 2 , 5 , 15 , 30 , and 60 min . Then , we mechanically unroofed and ﬁ xed cells to directly visualize clathrin at the cytoplasmic face of the PM using platinum replica transmission electron microscopy ( PREM ) 35 . In these images , we measured the nanoscale structure and distribution of clathrin - coated structures ( CCSs ) across the ventral PM of control and EGF stimulated cells . Remarkably , CCSs were 4 . 6 - fold more abundant in cells stimulated with EGF for 15 min ( Fig . 1a – d and Sup . Fig . 1 ) . This increment in CCSs abundance was also observed in cells grown on ﬁ bronectin - and laminin - coated glass ( Sup . Fig . 1 ) . PREM allowed us to segment distinct CCSs based on their curvature into three subclasses : ( 1 ) ﬂ at clathrin lattices ( FCLs ) , i . e . , where no curvature is evident ( shown in green ) ; ( 2 ) dome , i . e . , curved but the clathrin edge is visible ( blue ) ; and ( 3 ) sphere , i . e . , highly curved and the edge is not observable ( magenta ) ( Fig . 1a – d and Sup . Fig . 1 ) 36 . Representative segmentation masks illustrate the densities of diverse CCSs densities at different time points of EGF stimulation ( Fig . 1e ) . We compared the differences in densities by quantifying the membrane occupation of all CCSs ( Sup . Fig . 1 ) and individual subclasses ( Fig . 1f – h ) . All CCSs in control cells occupied 0 . 84 ± 0 . 2 % membrane area and markedly increased 2 . 5 - , 4 . 6 - and 5 - fold after EGF stimulation for 5 , 15 , and 30 min , respectively . The area of all CCSs decreased to near - baseline levels after 60 min ( 0 . 67 ± 0 . 33 % ) ( Sup . Fig . 1 ) . Notably , membrane area occupation of FCLs followed a similar time course to all CCSs classes , with a peak at 15 and 30 min post - EGF ( 3 . 2 ± 0 . 58 % , 6 . 5 - fold ; 3 . 3 ± 1 . 92 % , 6 . 7 - fold ) , reaching near - baseline levels at 60 min ( 0 . 5 ± 0 . 22 % ) ( Fig . 1f ) . In contrast , the mean membrane occupation of domed and spherical clathrin structures remained below 1 % with no signi ﬁ cant differences across the times tested ( Fig . 1g , h ) .

The 95 % con ﬁ dence interval range of the size of hundreds of FCLs increased starting at 5 min EGF treatment ( 34023 . 3 – 40528 . 6 nm 2 ) , with a peak after 15 min ( 34197 . 1 – 40416 . 1 nm 2 ) and 30 min ( 41783 . 9 – 49003 . 3 nm 2 ) and approached control levels after 60 min ( 25758 . 9 – 32889 . 3 nm 2 ) ( Fig . 1i ) . The average size of domed ( 21 , 993 . 9 ± 4294 . 8 nm 2 ) and spherical clathrin structures ( 11 , 075 . 2 ± 1714 . 7 nm 2 ) were similar to their respective controls across the time course ( Fig . 1j , k ) . Thus , EGF increased both the size and total area speci ﬁ cally occupied by FCLs at the ventral PM . Does clathrin behave differently on the top of the cell ? To answer this question we modi ﬁ ed the PREM protocol to image the structure of the inner face of the dorsal , non - adherent , PM . All CCSs occupation was ~ 30 % less in control dorsal PMs flat flat a b c d e f g Ctrl Ctrl E G F G e f i + E G F E G F R s i RN A + E G F EGF Gefi + EGF EGFR siRNA + EGF C t r l E G F E G F R s i R N A + E G F G e f i + E G F 0 1 2 3 4 5 m e m b r ane a r ea o cc upa t i on ( % ) C t r l E G F E G F R s i R N A + E G F G e f i + E G F a r ea ( n m ² x 1000 ) 0 100 200 300 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 28373 - x 4 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2022 ) 13 : 905 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 28373 - x | www . nature . com / naturecommunications ( 0 . 56 ± 0 . 17 % ) as compared to their ventral counterpart ( 0 . 84 ± 0 . 1 % ) ( Sup . Fig . 2 ) . Of note , EGF did not trigger an increase in the total amount of CCSs at the top of the cell , but a speci ﬁ c two - fold increase in the proportion of FCLs was measured . Interestingly , we did not observe an expansion in the size of individual FCLs in response to EGF at the dorsal surface ( Sup . Fig . 2 ) . Together , our nanoscale analysis revealed a direct connection between the relative abundance of FCLs at the dorsal surface and a dramatic expansion in both the size and abundance of FCLs at the ventral adherent surface of the plasma membrane in response to EGF stimulation . EGFR , Src , and β 5 - integrin are required for FCL formation . EGF triggers phosphorylation cascades that activate distinct cel - lular effectors . We considered that signaling can regulate FCL expansion during growth factor stimulation . To identify the possible members of the EGFR signaling pathway involved in this process , we performed both pharmacological and genetic screens . First , we targeted EGFR using ge ﬁ tinib ( Ge ﬁ ) , a drug that blocks receptor activity by binding to the ATP - binding pocket in the tyrosine kinase domain 37 . PREM of HSC3 cells preincubated with ge ﬁ tinib followed by EGF treatment showed a percentage of FCLs membrane area occupation ( Ge ﬁ + EGF = 0 . 66 ± 0 . 13 % ) similar to control cells ( Ctrl = 0 . 48 ± 0 . 11 % ) ( Fig . 2a – c ) . Ge ﬁ tinib decreased the effect of EGF on FCL formation by 4 . 8 - fold ( Fig . 2f ) . We observed a similar effect with EGFR knockdown cells ( EGFR siRNA + EGF ) ( Fig . 2d , f ) . Representative segmen - tation masks illustrate the structure and populations of CCSs in the different conditions analyzed ( Fig . 2e ) . Both approaches that interfered with EGFR showed a consistent inhibitory effect on the expansion of FCLs ( Fig . 2g ) . We then aimed to evaluate the role of the tyrosine kinase Src for two reasons . First , Src is a master effector immediately downstream of EGFR . Second , Src has been reported to directly phosphorylate proteins key to the endocytic machinery 38 – 40 . We used PP2 , a speci ﬁ c Src family kinase inhibitor 41 , and then challenged the cells with EGF . We observed a 4 . 1 - fold decrease in FCLs abundance after drug treatment compared to EGF alone , and similar as compared to control cells ( PP2 + EGF = 0 . 77 ± 0 . 24 % ) ( Fig . 3a – f ) . Src knock - down ( Src siRNA + EGF ) showed similar effects on preventing the expansion of FCLs area and size after EGF stimulation ( Fig . 3f , g ) . Next , we targeted the β 5 - integrin , a known component of FCLs 16 , 29 . We treated cells with cilengitide acid ( CTA ) , a molecule that speci ﬁ cally prevents β 5 - integrin interaction with the extra - cellular matrix 42 or a siRNA to knock down β 5 - integrin followed by EGF stimulation ( Fig . 4a – e ) . We detected a 2 . 2 - fold inhibition of FCL formation by CTA ( CTA + EGF = 1 . 48 ± 0 . 73 % ) , and a similar effect with β 5 - integrin siRNA ( β 5 siRNA + EGF = 0 . 77 ± 0 . 24 % ) ( Fig . 4f ) . Both approaches targeting β 5 - integrin showed a similar inhibitory effect on the growth of FCLs after EGF treatment ( Fig . 4g ) . Neither the drugs nor the different siRNAs , changed the percentage of membrane area or the size of ﬂ at , domed , and spherical clathrin structures , in the presence or absence of EGF ( Sup . Figs . 4 , 5 ) . β 5 - integrin interacts with actin through adapter proteins , and the actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in the regulation of FCLs 28 , 43 , 44 . Therefore , we next used Cytochalasin D ( CytoD ) , an acting disrupting drug , to test if perturbing ﬁ lamentous actin affects clathrin structure . Platinum replica EM showed that CytoD had an inhibitory effect on the relative growth of FCLs in cells treated with EGF ( Sup . Fig . 6 ) . FCLs are also known to control the activation of downstream signals such as the mitogen - activated protein kinase ERK1 / 2 29 , 45 . Yet , we did not detect major differences in the ultrastructure of clathrin in cells treated with a speci ﬁ c ERK1 / 2 inhibitor after EGF stimulation ( Sup . Fig . 7 ) . Overall , these data indicated that activated EGFR , the downstream tyrosine kinase Src , actin , and β 5 - integrin are all required for EGF - induced expansion of FCLs . EGFR , Src , and β 5 - integrin are differentially located in CCSs . We envisioned that EGFR , Src , and β 5 - integrin are spatially located in close proximity to FCLs to regulate their formation during EGF signaling . Using total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) along with a high - throughput two - color correlation analysis 46 , we mapped the location of EGFR , Src , and β 5 - integrin at thousands of individual clathrin - coated structures in an unbiased manner ( see Methods ) . Correlation analysis between single clathrin sites and the protein of interest measured as the degree of correlation ( correlation coef ﬁ cient ) is a quanti - tative local measure of spatial colocalization across the entire population of structures 46 – 48 . First , we assessed the correlation between EGFR and clathrin . To do this , we used the genome - edited HSC3 endogenously expressing EGFR - GFP and transfected them with mScarlet tagged clathrin light chain A ( mScarlet - CLCa ) . Figure 5a shows clathrin as diffraction - limited puncta , whereas EGFR appears as a more diffuse ﬂ uorescent signal across the ventral PM in control cells ( C = 0 . 15 ± 0 . 06 ) . EGF stimulation caused the appearance of pronounced EGFR clusters and a 2 . 4 - fold increase in its correlation with clathrin ( C = 0 . 36 ± 0 . 15 ) ( see white in overlay ) . We observed a similar increase in wild - type ( WT ) HSC3 cells co - transfected with EGFR - GFP and mScarlet - CLCa stimulated with EGF ( Sup . Fig . 8 ) . We then imaged control cells expressing Src - GFP that showed mottled ﬂ uorescence ( Fig . 5a ) . The Src signal correlated with clathrin ( C = 0 . 41 ± 0 . 1 ) , but decreased 2 . 2 - fold after EGF treatment for 15 min ( C = 0 . 18 ± 0 . 1 ) ( Fig . 5b ) . We further con ﬁ rmed the loss of Src from CCSs by showing that the correlation between Src and clathrin continuously decreases at intervals between 0 and 15 min of stimulation with EGF ( Sup . Fig . 9 ) . Interestingly , the β 5 - integrin signal appeared as discreet puncta that markedly correlated with ﬂ at , domed , and spherical clathrin as shown by TIRF correlative platinum replica electron micro - scopy images ( Sup . Fig . 10 ) . Correlation , however , remains high in both control ( C = 0 . 79 ± 0 . 11 ) and EGF - treated cells Fig . 2 Flat clathrin lattice formation requires EGFR . a Representative PREM images of control HSC3 - EGFR - GFP cells ( Ctrl ) , b cells treated either with 50 ng / mL EGF alone ( EGF ) for 15 min , or in presence of ( c ) 10 μ M ge ﬁ tinib ( Ge ﬁ + EGF ) , and d EGFR siRNA ( EGFR siRNA + EGF ) .

Thus , EGFR , Src , and β 5 - integrin differentially associate with clathrin . To further con ﬁ rm this , we measured the EGFR and Src signal using β 5 - integrin as a reference . Similarly , EGF stimulation increased the β 5 - integrin correlation with EGFR but decreased correlation with Src ( Sup . Fig . 11 ) . Of note , we tested other members of the β - integrin subfamily including β 1 , β 3 , and β 6 as well as α V , the most frequent partner of β 5 - integrin . However , the correlation values were 2 - to 4 - fold smaller when compared to the β 5 - integrin correlation with clathrin ( Sup . Fig . 12 ) . We also found that the correlation between clathrin and F - tractin , an actin ﬁ lament marker , decreases after 15 min of stimulation with EGF .

Fig . 6 ) . Altogether , these data support the idea that EGF leads to persistent recruitment of EGFR and β 5 - integrin into CCSs with a concurrent loss of Src . EGFR and β 5 - integrin are connected through phosphorylation . Next , we assessed the biochemical connection between EGFR , Src , and β 5 - integrin . EGF binding elicits EGFR dimerization leading to Src tyrosine kinase activation 49 . β 5 - integrin cytoplasmic domain has three tyrosine residues ( Y766 , Y774 , and Y796 ) that are highly conserved among their orthologues and paralogues ( Sup . Fig . 13 ) . In silico analysis suggested Src , among other kinases , has a substantial likelihood of catalyzing phosphorylation at all tyrosines of the β 5 - integrin cytoplasmic domain ( Sup . Fig . 13 ) . We , therefore , hypothesized that these proteins form a signaling loop that can regulate clathrin remodeling through phosphorylation . To support this hypothesis , we used a luciferase - coupled system to measure the phosphorylation of synthetic peptides corresponding to the β 5 - integrin cytoplasmic domain ( Fig . 6a ) . We detected a 13 . 6 - fold increase in the phos - phorylation of the WT peptide in the presence of Src , as com - pared to the negative control containing only the WT peptide ( Fig . 6b ) . By contrast , this effect was reduced when we tested the non - phosphorylatable peptide 3Y - F . As a positive control , we incubated a peptide corresponding to amino acids 6 – 20 of p34 cdc2 , a well - characterized Src substrate 50 , in the presence of puri ﬁ ed and active Src , and we detected phosphorylation . While β 5 - integrin has been reported to be phosphorylated by PAK4 at S759 and S762 51 , we did not detect phosphorylation when the WT β 5 - integrin peptide was incubated with puri ﬁ ed PAK4 ( Fig . 6b ) . These data indicate that the intracellular domain of β 5 - integrin is a Src substrate in vitro . To evaluate the cellular effects of tyrosine phosphorylation of β 5 - integrin , we co - transfected WT HSC3 cells with mScarlet - CLCa plus either the β 5 - integrin - GFP wild type ( WT ) , carboxyl - truncated ( Δ C ) , non - phosphorylatable ( 3Y - F ) , phosphomimetic ( 3Y - E ) , or PAK - targeted ( 2S - A ) mutants ( Fig . 6a ) . We tested these mutants using two - color TIRFM as previously described . In control cells , we observed that the ﬂ uorescent signal of either WT , 3Y - F , 3Y - E , or 2S - A mutants appeared as diffraction - limited punctate that highly correlated with clathrin ( C = 0 . 79 ± 0 . 1 , 0 . 81 ± 0 . 11 , 0 . 76 ± 0 . 08 , 0 . 82 ± 0 . 09 , respectively ) ( Fig . 6c , d ) . In contrast , the Δ C mutant exhibited a diffuse ﬂ uorescence across the membrane and a substantially decreased correlation with clathrin ( C = 0 . 41 ± 0 . 08 ) . In cells stimulated with EGF , we observed that the WT β 5 - integrin is strongly correlated with clathrin ( C = 0 . 84 ± 0 . 05 ) ( Figs . 5 , 6c , d ) . This spatial correlation was abolished in the Δ C ( C = 0 . 18 ± 0 . 12 ) and the 3Y - F mutant ( C = 0 . 46 ± 0 . 21 ) . By contrast , the correlation with clathrin persisted in the 3Y - E ( C = 0 . 76 ± 0 . 04 ) and the 2S - A mutants ( C = 0 . 8 ± 0 . 07 ) . Thus , β 5 - integrin requires tyrosine phosphorylation to spatially correlate with clathrin after EGF stimulation . Moreover , these experiments suggest that the crosstalk between EGFR and β 5 - integrin that is mediated by Src takes place at CCSs . FCLs regulate adhesion and sustained signaling at the PM . Next , we used Interference Re ﬂ ection Microscopy ( IRM ) to test if CCSs are cell adhesion sites . In IRM , the adhesion of a cell to the surface is measured as a change in intensity due to destructive interference of re ﬂ ected light between the cell / substrate interface 52 . In inverted images , the plasma membrane of unroofed cells transfected with mSca - CLCa appeared bright against a dark background indicating adhesion ( Sup . Fig . 14 ) . In these images , bright spots are an indicator of how tight the membrane adheres to the substrate . In parallel , we used TIRF to visualize CCSs and then automatically measured the correlation between the clathrin signal and the IRM signal across thousands of individual clathrin spots . IRM images showed a distinctive IRM signal at sites of clathrin , indicating increased amounts of adhesion relative to the surrounding membrane . We detected a subtle but measurable increase in clathrin / IRM correlation ( adhesion ) between control and EGF - treated cells ( Sup . Fig . 14 ) . Our IRM data directly show that single clathrin sites are nanos - cale adhesion sites . We hypothesized that FCLs mediate EGFR membrane - associated signal transduction by regulating the distribution of active EGFR and downstream interactors in both space and time . Using TIRFM , we next visualized the presence of active EGFR at the PM by immunolabeling endogenous phosphor - Y1068 ( P - EGFR ) , a well - established marker of EGFR activity ( Fig . 7a ) . In stimulated cells , the correlation of P - EGFR with clathrin increased 3 . 5 - fold ( C = 0 . 74 ± 0 . 08 ) with respect to the control ( C = 0 . 24 ± 0 . 06 ) . Conversely , disruption of FCLs formation by β 5 - integrin knockdown ( β 5 siRNA + EGF ) , decreased the P - EGFR correlation with clathrin by ~ 25 % ( C = 0 . 56 ± 0 . 1 ) ( Fig . 7b ) . A similar trend was observed when we measured the ﬂ uorescence intensity of P - EGFR at the PM ( Fig . 7c ) . Further - more , we measured the ﬂ uorescence intensity of the total EGFR - GFP signal ( T - EGFR ) at the PM as an indicator of receptor internalization . We observed that EGF led to a 34 . 6 % decrease of the T - EGFR , and β 5 - integrin siRNA further decreased receptor levels at the PM ( 68 . 2 % ) ( Fig . 7d ) . We also examined the location of the downstream master scaffold Grb2 in FCLs ( Fig . 7e ) . While EGF caused an increase in both Grb2 correlations with clathrin and recruitment of the adapter to the PM , β 5 - integrin knock - down blocked these effects ( Fig . 7f , g ) . These observations were reproduced when interfering with β 5 - integrin using a pharma - cological approach ( Sup . Fig . 15 ) . Together these data highlight the function of FCLs as sustained signaling hubs for growth factor receptors . These results suggest that FCLs capture and organize growth factor signals at the ventral PM by delaying the endocytosis of a population of active EGFR along with key partner proteins such as Grb2 .

Discussion Crosstalk between signaling systems allows for biological pro - cesses to be integrated , responsive , and adaptable 53 . There is an emerging hypothesis that FCLs can act as signaling zones or adhesion sites at the PM , ﬁ lling unique roles outside of endocy - tosis . Here , we show that activated EGFR , Src , and β 5 - integrin are coupled to dramatic growth and maintenance of FCLs in human cells . These ﬂ at clathrin sites in turn partition and enhance growth factor signals at the PM ( Fig . 8 ) . Thus , two receptor systems ( growth factor and integrins ) are connected , clustered , flat flat a b c d e f g Ctrl Ctrl E G F EGF CTA + EGF (cid:2) 5 siRNA + EGF C t r l E G F (cid:2) 5 s i R N A + E G F C T A + E G F 0 1 2 3 4 5 m e m b r ane a r ea o cc upa t i on ( % ) C t r l E G F (cid:2) 5 s i R N A + E G F C T A + E G F a r ea ( n m ² x 1000 ) 0 100 200 300 C T A + E G F (cid:2) 5 s i RN A + E G F ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 28373 - x 8 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2022 ) 13 : 905 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 28373 - x | www . nature . com / naturecommunications and controlled at the nanoscale by endocytic proteins . We pro - pose that a reciprocal feedback loop operates where FCLs facil - itate local crosstalk between EGFR , β 5 - integrin , and other signaling proteins to create dynamic signaling hubs at the PM . First , we observed clathrin using platinum replica electron microscopy to distinguish ﬂ at from curved clathrin structures . Surprisingly , EGFR activation resulted in a dramatic increase in FCLs size and density . Domed and spherical clathrin were mostly unchanged . Blocking the receptor abolished these effects . Of note , these structural changes follow a time course similar to the acti - vation dynamics of downstream kinases 54 , further supporting the direct connection between clathrin remodeling and signal trans - duction . Although we observed changes in the number of caveolae across the membrane , this represents an exciting opportunity for future research . Our pharmacological and genetic perturbations linked the tyrosine kinase Src and the adhesion receptor β 5 - integrin to FCL growth and EGFR activation . Historically , growth factor receptors and integrins have been biochemically connected to Src in several ways 7 . Here , we show a direct spatial connection . We also found that FCLs are preloaded with a subpopulation of Src . Src was partially released from the complex over time in response to EGF . In contrast , β 5 - integrin is enriched in FCLs 16 , 29 , 30 , and we found that this correlation with clathrin persists in response to EGF . Thus , EGFR , Src , and β 5 - integrin are dynamically coupled through FCLs to regulate EGF signaling . We showed that this new pathway is controlled by phos - phorylation . Speci ﬁ cally , in silico analysis and biochemical assays indicated that the β 5 - integrin intracellular domain is a Src sub - strate . Src activation kinetics are fast and occur within 5 min 55 . Thus , it is possible that at an early stage of clathrin growth , Src phosphorylates targets and is then released . While our results point toward an early phosphorylation event in β 5 - integrin - mediated by Src , it is also possible that Src continually cycles on and off clathrin during receptor activation and plays a more extended role in the process . Likewise , Src is a wide - ranging kinase and might phosphorylate additional substrates located on other PM structures such as caveolae and focal adhesions 56 , 57 . Additionally , Src is known to phosphorylate clathrin heavy chain 39 , whether this directly regulates clathrin assembly and dynamics is an exciting opportunity for future experimentation . Second , we found that deletion of the β 5 - integrin cytoplasmic domain and non - phosphorylatable mutations ( 3Y - F ) block integrin association with clathrin . These effects were rescued by a phosphomimic mutant ( 3Y - E ) , suggesting that tyrosine phos - phorylation of β 5 - integrin is a molecular switch in this process . Interestingly , the β 5 - integrin cytoplasmic domain interacts with endocytic proteins including Eps15 , ARH , and Numb 16 . Integrin cytoplasmic tails can also induce profound differences in the behavior of integrins 58 . Thus , we propose that a phosphorylation switch in β 5 - integrin is the regulator for the orchestrated recruitment of the endocytic machinery to sites where FCLs form and grow . In this regard , the growth factor response is directly linked to cellular adhesion proteins through activation of endo - cytic proteins and controlled by phosphorylation . A recent hypothesis proposes that long - lived FCLs arise from adhesive forces generated from integrins that physically prevent clathrin from curving , a process called frustrated endocytosis 29 , 22 , 45 . Interestingly , we observed the FCL formation and the enrichment of active EGFR and Grb2 peaks after 15 min of stimulation with EGF ( Figs . 1 and 7 ) . At the same time , we detected a decrease in the overall level of EGFR at the PM . This decrease suggests that EGF triggers the internalization of a sub - population of EGFR into endosomal compartments known to control the speci ﬁ city and robustness of the cytoplasmic signaling response 59 , 60 . Signaling is thought to continue in these endosomal carriers in some cases . In parallel , we propose that some phos - phorylated and active receptors remain at the PM in clathrin . By preventing endocytosis of a subpopulation of EGFR , this clathrin / adhesion / receptor complex could prolong EGF signaling at the membrane . These domains might also act as diffusion traps for additional EGFR and other growth factor receptors whose dif - fusion decreases after agonist stimulation 61 – 64 . Using ﬂ uores - cence microscopy , EGFR and other structurally diverse receptors have been reported to form long - lived complexes 22 , 65 – 68 . In contrast , stimulation of the LPA1 receptor has been shown to trigger the depolymerization of FCLs through a process that depends on actin cytoskeleton polymerization 28 . Thus , different systems might activate or deactivate these structures to regulate their activity . How endocytosis , adhesion , receptor diffusion , and actin cytoskeletal dynamics cooperate across the entire popula - tion of active receptors to control signaling will be an important future area of study . Furthermore , how the formation of these domains impacts the overall cell and tissue signaling behaviors are important areas for future study . Interestingly , we ﬁ nd measurable differences in the growth and size of ﬂ at clathrin lattices between the ventral and dorsal plasma membrane of the cell . We propose that these differences are a direct result of the interaction between the β 5 - Integrin and the extracellular matrix . These interactions would not occur along the dorsal surface , further supporting a direct mechanical role of adhesion to the maintenance and expansion of these growth factor signaling domains . This bimodal behavior adds a layer of complexity to the EGFR signaling system in cells . Here , the top and bottom of the cell could be acting differently in response to EGF and the cumulative effects could in ﬂ uence signaling in complex ways . Future work on the integration of different regional cellular signals into global signaling outcomes are key to understanding how cells and tissues respond to EGF . Is this mechanism unique to EGFR ? Many receptors including seven - transmembrane receptors and B cell receptors trigger cla - thrin nucleation at the PM upon biding their ligands 22 , 65 – 68 . For the β 2 - adrenergic receptor , the increase in clathrin occurs with a delay in clathrin - coated vesicle maturation and no differences in the overall rate of vesicle scission 66 .

It is possible that other receptor cargos also stabilize ﬂ at clathrin coats to act as nanoscale receptor sig - naling domains . Thus , FCLs could be generalized signaling hubs at the PM . Future work is needed to test this hypothesis and to map the nanoscale location of the proteins identi ﬁ ed here and other possible interactors within the clathrin lattice . Growing evidence suggests that signaling systems are locally organized by organelles and cytoskeletal structures . We propose that FCLs are a unique plasma membrane scaffold that dynami - cally organizes receptors and signaling molecules in space and time through multivalent interactions at the nanoscale . We suggest that crosstalk between EGFR and β 5 - integrin through Src phosphor - ylation occurs in FCLs and simultaneously regulates their expan - sion and maintenance . Finally , because of the importance of EGFR / Src / β 5 - integrin in the physiology of cells and tissues , and the connection between dysregulation of these systems and cancer , FCLs likely play a broader role in coordinating the responses to chemical and mechanical stimuli . For example , how the growth and regulation of these clathrin signaling domains impacts cell motility , metastasis , growth , division , gene expression , or differ - entiation are important areas for future investigations . Likewise , how these clathrin adhesion signaling domains might behave in complex tissues are unknown . Future work is needed to provide insight into how these signaling platforms dynamically organize , coordinate , and regulate this essential biology at the nanoscale .

Cells were incubated in starvation buffer ( DMEM containing 4 . 5 g / L D - glucose , supplemented with 1 % v / v Glutamax and 10 mM HEPES ) for 1h before the pulse - chase assay . Then , cells were pulsed in starvation buffer supplemented with 0 . 1 % w / v bovine serum albumin at 4°C for 40min with 50ng / mL human recombinant EGF ( Thermo - Fisher , Gibco TM , PHG0311L ) to allow ligand bind to the EGFR . In brief , cells were washed twice with PBS ( Thermo - Fisher , Gibco TM , 10010023 ) . Synchronized receptor activation and endocytosis were triggered by placing the coverslips in pre - warmed media and incubating at 37 °C for the indicated times . To stop stimulation , cells were washed twice with ice - cold PBS . To block EGFR , Src , β 5 - integrin , actin cytoskeleton , and ERK1 / 2 , cells were incubated for 15 min before the chase and during pulse with 10 μ M ge ﬁ tinib ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , 184475 - 35 - 2 ) , 10 μ M PP2 ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c , 172889 - 27 - 9 ) , 10 μ M cilengitide acid ( CTA ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , SML1594 ) , 10 μ M cytochalasin D ( Millipore , 504776 ) , and SCH772988 ( Selleckche , S7101 ) , respectively . Plasma membrane preparation and ﬁ xation . After EGF pulse - chase stimulations , cells were rinsed brie ﬂ y with stabilization buffer ( 30 mM HEPES , 70mM KCl , 5mM MgCl 2 , 3 mM EGTA , pH 7 . 4 ) . Ventral cell membranes were obtained with the application of unroo ﬁ ng buffer containing 2 % paraformaldehyde in stabiliza - tion buffer using a 10mL syringe with a 22 gauge , 1 . 5 needle . The syringe was held vertically within 1cm of the coverslip during the mechanical unroo ﬁ ng . To prepare dorsal plasma membranes , we inverted cell - containing coverslips onto PDL - coated coverslips ﬂ anked with two 3mm× 3000 mm strips of para ﬁ lm and covered with 400 μ L of stabilization buffer . A pencil eraser was applied to the top center of the coverslips with light pressure for 10s before the coverslips were lifted away . Then , dorsal membranes were found around the pencil eraser application area of the bottom coverslip . After either of the mechanical manipulations , coverslips were washed once and moved to a fresh stabilization buffer containing 2 % paraf - ormaldehyde for 20 min .

Emitted light was ﬁ ltered using a 565 DCXR dichroic mirror on the image splitter ( Photometrics ) , passed through 525Q / 50 and 605Q / 55 ﬁ lters , and projected onto the chip of an electron - multiplying charge - coupled device ( EMCCD ) camera . Images were acquired using the Andor IQ2 software . Cells were excited with alternate green and red excitation light , and images in each channel were acquired at 500 - ms exposure at 5Hz . We used Matlab software previously reported 46 to automatically identify clathrin spots in one channel and extract small , square regions centered at the brightest pixel of each object . Matched regions from the same cellular location in the corresponding image were extracted . An equal number of randomly positioned regions were also extracted to test for nonspeci ﬁ c colocalization . The mean correlation between thousands of clathrin spots and their corresponding image pairs across several cells from independent experiments was calculated using Pearson ’ s correlation coef ﬁ - cient . The corrected total cell ﬂ uorescence ( CTCF ) at the PM ( Fig . 7 and Sup . Fig . 15 ) was assessed with ImageJ software by measuring the integrated density of manually segmented membranes using the following formula : CTCF = Integrated Density – ( Area of the segmented cell * Mean ﬂ uorescence of three background readings ) / area of the segmented cell . Correlative light and electron microscopy ( CLEM ) . For TIRF / CLEM , we fol - lowed the protocol previously reported 48 . In brief , HSC3 WT cells were plated on collagen - coated coverslips , transfected with β 5 - integrin - GFP , and processed 1 day later . Cells were starved , stimulated , and unroofed as described above . Membranes were unroofed and ﬁ xed for 20min in 2 % PFA . After ﬁ xation , membranes were stained for Clathrin Heavy Chain and phalloidin – Alexa Fluor 647 as mentioned in the immuno ﬂ uorescence section . TIRF microscopy was used to image a 15× 15 image montage of a large ﬁ eld of unroofed cells . After ﬂ uorescence imaging , the coverslips were marked with a diamond objective marker and ﬁ xed in 2 % glu - taraldehyde in PBS overnight at 4°C . PREM of the marked region was performed as reported previously 35 . The replica was lifted and placed onto copper TEM grids and imaged with ×20 phase - contrast objective to ﬁ nd the same regions that were originally imaged in ﬂ uorescence . Each cell of interest was located on the grid prior to TEM imaging . The ﬂ uorescence images were ﬁ tted to the EM images using an af ﬁ ne spatial transformation with nearest - neighbor interpolation to map the Gaussian centers of clathrin structures visible in both TIRF and EM images . The correlation was performed using MATLAB code already reported 35 , 36 . TIRF / EM overlay were created to observe the colocalization of clathrin - coated structures in EM with ﬂ uorescence image of β 5 - integrin - GFP in TIRF . Interference re ﬂ ection microscopy ( IRM ) / GFP TIRF . IRM / TIRF was imple - mented on a Nikon inverted ﬂ uorescence microscope ( Ti2 Eclipse , Nikon ) with an Fig . 6 β 5 - integrin phosphorylation controls spatial correlation with clathrin . a Diagram of β 5 - integrin and magni ﬁ cation of the cytoplasmic domain showing different mutants .

Epi - illumination for IRM was performed with a mercury lamp illuminator ( Intensilight C - HGFI , Nikon ) ﬁ ltered with a 515 long - pass ﬁ lter . A dichroic below the objective ( Omega 490 - 600DBDR ) was used to re ﬂ ect a 488 nm TIRF illumi - nation laser and the IRM epi - illumination sequentially into the objective . Images were acquired using the Nikon ( NIS ) Elements version 5 . 2 software . Unroofed HSC3 transfected with GFP - CLCa were illuminated for IRM and GFP TIRF separately and ﬂ uorescence or re ﬂ ected light was collected through two different emission ﬁ lters ( 525 / 50 nm for GFP , 600 / 50 nm for IRM ) onto an Andor iXon Ultra 897 EMCCD . For IRM , the aperture diaphragm of the epi - illumination was adjusted to optimize contrast . Large montages were generated in IRM and the GFP channel for each sample . IRM image processing was performed as follows . Each image in the montage was averaged to form a ﬁ eld background image which was subtracted from each image . The stack of images was then baseline shifted by subtracting the minimum pixel value of the entire stack . Finally , the stack was normalized to the mean pixel value such that its max intensity was three times the mean . Single images of cells from this montage were contrast inverted and used with their corresponding GFP images for further analysis . In each whole - cell GFP image ( GFP - CLCa ) , all the local maxima above a user - de ﬁ ned threshold and > 2 μ m away from the edge of the cell boundary were identi ﬁ ed . Each local maximum was centered in a 4 μ m ×4 μ m cropped region . The mean correlation between thou - sands of clathrin spots and their corresponding IRM image pairs across several cells from independent experiments was calculated as described above .
