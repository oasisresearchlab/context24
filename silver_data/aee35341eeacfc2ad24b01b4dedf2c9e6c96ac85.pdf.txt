Cells in culture reveal high levels of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in their focal adhesions , the regions where cells adhere to the underlying substra - tum . We have examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in response to plating cells on extracellular matrix substrata . Rat embryo fibroblasts , mouse Balb / c 3T3 , and NIH 3T3 cells plated on fibronectin - coated surfaces revealed elevated phosphotyrosine levels in a cluster of proteins between 115 and 130 kD . This in - crease in tyrosine phosphorylation was also seen when rat embryo fibroblasts were plated on laminin or vitro - nectin , but not on polylysine or on uncoated plastic . Integrin mediation of this effect was suggested by finding the same pattern of elevated tyrosine phos - phorylation in cells plated on the cell - binding frag - ment of fibronectin and in ceils plated on a synthetic polymer containing multiple RGD sequences . We have identified one of the proteins of the 115 - 130 - kD clus - ter as pp125 ~ , a tyrosine kinase recently localized in focal adhesions ( Schaller , M . D . , C . A . Borgman , B . S . Cobb , R . R . Vines , A . B . Reynolds , and J . T . Parsons . 1992 . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA . 89 : 5192 ) . A second protein that becomes tyrosine phos - phorylated in response to extracellular matrix adhe - sion is identified as paxillin , a 70 - kD protein previ - ously localized to focal adhesions . Treatment of cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A dimin - ished the adhesion - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins and inhibited the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers . These results suggest a role for integrin - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in the organization of the cytoskeleton as cells adhere to the extracellular matrix . T hE extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ~ affects many aspects of cell behavior , including the migratory properties of cells , their morphology , growth characteristics , and differentiation ( Hay , 1981 ; Hynes , 1990 ) . The means by which the ECM exerts these effects are largely unknown , but there is evidence that many of these actions are mediated through integrins , the family of ECM receptors found on most cells . Integrins are t ~ heterodimers ; each subunit has a large extracellular domain , spans the membrane once , and has a short cytoplasmic sequence ( Buck and Horwitz , 1987 ; Hynes , 1987 ; Ruoslahti and Pierschbacher , 1987 ) . Multiple ct and ~ subunits have been identified ( Albelda and Buck , 1990 ; Hemler , 1990 ; Hynes , 1992 ) . Some subunits are shared by many integrins ( e . g . , 13 ~ ) , whereas others appear to be unique . During the last few years much has been learned about the interaction of integrins with particular ECM com - ponents such as fibronectin or vitronectin . In many cells in culture , integrins are clustered at sites of adhesion to the un - derlying ECM in regions known as focal adhesions ( focal contacts or adhesion plaques ) ( for review , see Burridge et 1 . Abbreviations used in this paper : ECM , extracellular matrix ; REE rat embryo fibroblasts . al . , 1988 ) . The extracellular face of focal adhesions provides attachment to matrix components adsorbed onto the plastic or glass culture surface , whereas the cytoplasmic face pro - vides a site of attachment for bundles of actin filaments ( stress fibers ) . Evidence from in vitro binding experiments indicates that integrins can interact with at least two cyto - skeletal proteins , talin ( Horwitz et al . , 1986 ) and ot - actinin ( Otey et al . , 1990 ) . Along with several other cytoskeletal proteins , talin and ot - actinin are concentrated at the cyto - plasmic face of focal adhesions ( Burridge et al . , 1988 ) . Focal adhesions are thought to be important not only as structural links between the ECM and the cytoskeleton , but also as sites of signal transduction from the ECM . Several potential regulatory enzymes have been identified in focal adhesions ( Burridge et al . , 1988 ) . These include protein ki - nase C Oaken et al . , 1989 ) and several tyrosine kinases ( RJahrschneider , 1980 ; Rohrschneider and Gentry , 1984 ; Rohrschneider and Najita , 1984 ) . Considerable attention has been directed toward the tyrosine kinase pp60 V - s ~ , which is localized to the residual focal adhesions of cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus ( Rohrschneider , 1980 ) . Pp60 ~ - ~ has not yet been detected in the focal adhesions of normal cells , but elevated phosphotyrosine has been noted (cid:14)9 The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 92 / 11 / 893 / 11 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 119 , Number 4 , November 1992 893 - 903 893 on J une 26 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 15 , 1992 at these sites in both transformed ( Comoglio et al . , 1984 ) and normal cells ( Maher et al . , 1985 ) , indicating that this or other tyrosine ldnases must be present and active . The newly described tyrosine kinase , pp125 FAK , has been cloned , se - quenced , and localized to the focal adhesions of normal fibroblasts by Parsons ' group ( Schaller et al . , 1992 ) . Direct evidence for a relationship between integrins and tyrosine ki - nase activation has been provided by Kornberg et al . ( 1991 ) and by Guan et al . ( 1991 ) . Kornberg and co - workers demon - strated an elevation in phosphotyrosine in proteins of ' ~ 130 kD when the integrin ( o ~ 3 / $ ~ ) was aggregated by antibodies on the surface of KB cells . Guan and colleagues found that plating NIH 3T3 cells on fibronectin , but not on polylysine or plastic , led to the tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein at ~ o120 kD . This phosphorylation could also be induced by adhesion of these cells to an anti - integrin antibody and it was shown that this response required the cytoplasmic domain of the B ~ integrin ( Guan et al . , 1991 ) . In this paper , we have explored the tyrosine phosphoryla - tion that occurs in response to cell adhesion to different ex - tracellular matrix substrates . We detect a prominent cluster of bands with elevated phosphotyrosine that are between 115 and 130 kD in extracts from rat embryo fibroblasts , mouse NIH 3T3 , and Balb / c 3T3 cells adhering to fibronectin . Phos - phorylation on tyrosine is low in these bands in extracts of the same cell types that have been plated on plastic or kept in suspension . We show that one of these proteins is pp125 ~ ~ the new tyrosine kinase identified by Schaller et al . ( 1992 ) . We identify a second protein of ~ 70 kD that be - comes tyrosine - phosphorylated in response to ECM adhe - sion as paxillin , a focal adhesion protein ( Turner et al . , 1990 ) that is also tyrosine - phosphorylated during embryonic development ( Turner , 1991 ) . The increase in tyrosine phos - phorylation induced by cell adhesion to fibronectin is in - hibited by herbimycin A . Cells treated with herbimycin A show a decrease in focal adhesion and stress fiber formation . These findings suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation plays a role in the cytoskeletal organization induced by integrin - mediated adhesion to ECM . Materials and Methods Cell Culture and Adhesion to Substrates Rat embryo fibroblasts ( REF52 ) and mouse Balb / c 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium , supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 50 U / ml penicillin , and 50 # g / ml streptomycin . Mouse NIH 3T3 cells were cultivated in the same medium with 10 % calf serum . Cells were passaged 1 - 3 d before use . FOr adhesion experiments the REF52 cells were trypsinized , washed once in medium containing 10 % serum , washed once in serum - free medium , resuspended , and plated in serum - free medium . For adhesion experiments with Balb / c 3T3 and NIH 3T3 cells , the cultures were pretreated with 25 / ~ g / ml cycloheximide for 2 h . After trypsinization , the cells were washed in serum - free medium containing 1 mg / ml turkey egg white trypsin inhibitor ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) . The cells were washed once in serum - free medium and resuspended and plated in serum - free medium . For gel and blot analysis cells were plated at , ~ 4 x I0 ~ cellsflO - cm culture dish . Coverslips or culture dishes were coated with ECM proteins or other polymers by incubation at 37 " C for 90 rain , or in some experiments by incubation overnight at 4 ~ except for Pronectin - F , which was incubated with surfaces for 90 rain at room temperature . Before plating cells , coverslips or dishes were rinsed twice in PBS . Poly - L - lysine ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) was used at 0 . 5 mg / mi ; human plasma fibronectin ( New York Blood Center , New York ) was used at 0 . 05 - 0 . 1 mg / ml ; 105 - kD cell - binding fragment of fibronectin ( Woods et al . , 1986 ) was a generous girl from Dr . John Couchman ( University of Alabama at Birmingham , Bir - mingham , AL ) and was used at 0 . 05 rng / ml ; laminin ( ICN Biomedicals , Inc . , Costa Mesa , CA ) was used at 0 . 1 mg / ml ; vitronectin ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) was used at 0 . 025 mg / mi ; Pronectin - F ( Protein Polymer Technologies , Inc . , San Diego , CA ) was used at 0 . 1 mg / ml . For some experiments , rat em - bryo fibroblasts were treated with various concentrations of herbimycin A ( Gibco BRL , G - aithersburg , MD ) ( dissolved in DMSO ) and prepared in par - allel with untreated controls 24 h later by plating on fibronectin as above in the presence of herbimycin A at the same concentration . SDS - PAGE and Western Blot Analysis For SDS gel electrophoresis dishes were drained of medium and the cells were dissolved by scraping with a Teflon policeman in 200 / ~ 1 of Laemmli sample buffer containing 1 mM Na orthovanadate . The samples were boiled for 2 rain and the DNA was sheared by passing several times through a 26 - gauge needle . Samples containing equal protein concentrations were elec - trophoresed on 7 . 5 % or 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gels ( Laemmli , 1970 ) with bisacrylamide concentrations of 0 . 19 and 0 . 13 % , respectively . After electrophoresis , gels were either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose ( Towbin et al . , 1979 ) . After blocking of the nitrocellulose , phosphotyrosine - contalning proteins were visualized in most cases by incu - bation with t25I - labeled py20 ( " , 2 x 106 cprrdml ) for 60 min . After wash - ing for 60 min , the nitrocellulose was exposed with an intensifying screen to x - ray film for autoradiography . Py20 was the generous gift of Dr . John Glenney ( University of Kentucky , Lexington , KY ) or was purchased from ICN Biomedicals , Inc . Py20 was radio - iodinated using iodogen ( Pierce Chemical Co . , Rockford , IL ) ( Fraker and Speck , 1978 ) . Iodine - 125 was purchased from New England Nuclear ( Boston , MA ) . In some experi - ments , phosphotyrosine - containing proteins were visualized by incubating with a 1 : 1 , 500 dilution of the antibody PT66 ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) , fol - lowed by affinity - purified rabbit anti - mouse IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Inc . , West Grove , PA ) followed by ~ 251 - protein A at 8 x 105 cpm / ml ( a gift from Dr . S . Earp , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , NC ) . Immunoprecipitation Cells were lysed by scraping in 150 mM NaCI , 0 . 1 % NAN3 , 50 mM Tris HCI , pH 7 . 6 ( TBS ) that contained 2 mM EDTA , 1 mM Na orthovanadate , 10 ~ g / ml lenpeptin , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 0 . 1 % Na deoxycholate . The ly - sates were clarified by centrifugation at 100 , 000 g for 30 min . Anti - phosphotyrosine antibody coupled directly to agarose beads was added to the supernatants and incubated with end - over - end mixing for 90 rain at 4 ~ The beads were sedimented by brief centrifugation at 12 , 000 g and washed extensively with lysis buffer . Phosphotyrosine - contalning proteins were released from the antibody by incubating on ice for 30 min in 10 mM phenylpbosphate in lysis buffer containing 0 . 1 mg / ml ovalbumin as carrier protein . The beads were pelleted and the supernatant was used to precipitate paxillin in a similar manner by incubating with agarose beads coupled with anti - paxillin ( antibody 165 ) ( Glenney and Zokas , 1989 ; 3Mrner et al . , 1990 ) . Other lysates were incubated with monoclonal anti - pp125 FAx ( anti - body 2A7 ; generous gift of ' Ibm Parsons , University of Virginia , Charlottes - ville , VA ; Schaller et al . , 1992 ) . Rabbit anti - mouse IgG ( Jackson Im - munoResearch Laboratories , Inc . ) bound to protein A Sepharose was then added to these samples . Beads from all of the above experiments were sedimented by brief centrifugation after immunoprecipitation and washed extensively with lysis buffer . Proteins were then released for SDS - PAGE and blot analysis by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer with 1 mM Na orthovana - date for 3 rain . Fluorescence Microscopy For immunofluorescence microscopy cells were fixed in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in Dulbecco ' s phosphate - buffered saline for 8 rain , rinsed in TBS , and per - meabilized for 5 min in TBS containing 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 . The coverslips were then incubated at 37 ~ in py20 ( 10 t ~ g / mi ) mixed with afffinity - purified rabbit anti - human talin . ( In some experiments the coverslips were stained with py20 before staining with the anti - talin antibody , but no significant differences were detected in the resulting staining patterns ) . After 45 min the coverslips were timed extensively in TBS and then stained with a mix - ture of rhodamina - labeled , affinity - purified goat anti - mouse IgG ( Chemi - con International Inc . , Temecula , CA ) and fluorescein - labeled , affinity - purified goat anti - rabbit IgG ( Chemicon International Inc . ) for 45 min at 37 ~ Other eoverslips were incubated with rhodamine - eonjngated phal - loidin ( Molecular Probes , Inc . , Eugene , OR ) , mixed with anti - paxillin anti - body , and then stained with affinity - purified goat anti - mouse IgG ( Jackson The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 119 , 1992 894 on J une 26 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 15 , 1992 ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Inc . ) . The coverslips were washed in TBS , rinsed in deionized water , and mounted with gelvatol . Coverslips were viewed either on a Zeiss IM35 or an Axiophot microscope . Fluorescence micrographs were taken on T - max 400 film ( Eastman Kodak Co . ) . Results Distribution of Phosphotyrosine in Cultured ~ broblasts The distribution of phosphotyrosine - containing proteins in rat embryo fibroblasts ( REF52 ) plated in serum - free medium for different intervals on a fibronectin - coated surface was ex - amined by immunofluorescence microscopy using the mono - clonal antibody py20 ( Fig . 1 ) . After 1 h of adhesion the most prominent localization of phosphotyrosine - containing pro - teins was in the focal adhesions , revealed by double - labeling with antibodies against talin . This result was consistent with previous observations ( Maher et al . , 1985 ) . At early time points after plating ( e . g . , 10 - 15 min ) no focal adhesions could be detected and the cells were well rounded ( data not shown ) . As the cells spread , focal adhesions became increas - ingly prominent and in many cells the staining patterns with anti - phosphotyrosine and anti - talin appeared to be closely coincident in terms of focal adhesion staining . However , with the anti - phosphotyrosine antibody , the staining of adhe - sions at the cell periphery was often brighter than the stain - ing of more central adhesions . This was particularly true where cells came into contact with each other and in ceils plated for long periods ( Fig . 1 , C - F ) . In some cases the more central adhesions stained only very weakly , if at all , for phosphotyrosine , but appeared to be uniformly stained with antibodies against talin ( Fig . 1 , C - F ) . To ensure that this staining pattern was not the result of the polyclonal anti - talin competing with or blocking the monoclonal anti - phospho - tyrosine , these antibodies were also used sequentially with the monoclonal being used first . This did not affect the ob - served patterns ( data not shown ) . Since focal adhesions tend to form at the periphery ( Izzard and Lochner , 1980 ; DePas - quale and Izzard , 1987 ) where the anti - phosphotyrosine staining is often brightest , we suspect that the tyrosine phos - phorylation of focal adhesion proteins is associated more with the formation of these structures than with their main - tenance or disassembly . Western Blot Analysis of ~ yrosine Phosphorylation in Response to ECM Adhesion To examine which proteins contain phosphotyrosine , ex - tracts of REF52 plated on fibronectin in serum - free medium for different periods were electrophoresed on SDS gels , transferred to nitrocellulose , and blotted with ~ 2 ~ I - py20 ( Fig . 2 ) . A relatively simple profile of phosphotyrosine - containing bands was revealed and a subset of these proteins showed a marked increase in phosphotyrosine content with increasing time of adhesion to fibronectin as compared with cells kept in suspension . These had approximate molecular masses of 130 , 115 , and 70 kD . It should be noted that when cells were kept in suspension the level of tyrosine phos - phorylation decreased progressively until it was essentially undetectable by ~ , 90 rain ( data not shown ) . However , when these suspended cells were plated on fibronectin they devel - oped the same pattern of bands showing elevated phos - photyrosine with the same time course ( data not shown ) . We were interested in whether this elevation in tyrosine phosphorylation could be induced by adhesion to other sub - strates . REF52 plated on uncoated plastic or on polylysine failed to show an elevation in phosphotyrosine ( data not shown ) , consistent with the results of Guan et al . ( 1991 ) . To investigate whether adhesion to ECM proteins other than fibronectin would promote tyrosine phosphorylation , REF52 were plated in serum - free medium on dishes that had been coated with fibronectin , vitronectin , or laminin . REF52 were observed to adhere well and spread on each of these proteins . The cells were harvested in sample buffer 1 h after plating and analyzed by Western blotting with t ' I - py20 ( Fig . 3 ) . Compared with adhesion to uncoated plastic , in each case the adhesion of REF52 to fibronectin , vitronectin , and lami - nin generated the same pattern of bands that were elevated in phosphotyrosine . To check that this effect was not due to the cells interacting with their own secreted fibronectin , par - allel cultures were stained with anti - fibronectin and exam - ined by immunofluorescence microscopy . No extracellular fibronectin was detected ( data not shown ) . Since fibronectin , vitronectin , and laminin share the char - acteristic that they all interact with cells via members of the integrin family of ECM receptors , the elevated phosphotyro - sine induced by adhesion to these proteins is consistent with the earlier work implicating integrins in tyrosine phosphory - lation ( Guan et al . , 1991 ; Kornberg et al . , 1991 ) . To further explore the role of integrins in this response , REF52 were plated on the cell - binding fragment of fibronectin . This con - tains the RGD sequence that is involved in binding to the ma - jor fibronectin receptor , the integrin a ~ l . RGD sequences are present in many other ECM proteins , including laminin and vitronectin , and contribute to the binding of appropriate integrins to these proteins . REF52 were also plated on Pronectin - F , a synthetic polymer that contains multiple RGD sequences and that is presumably recognized by one or more integrins ( Fig . 3 ) . The REF52 spread well on the cell - binding fragment of fibronectin , but spread less effectively on Pronectin - E Analysis by Western blotting revealed that , compared with adhesion to uncoated plastic , the cells on the cell - binding fragment of fibronectin and on Pronectin - F both contained elevated phosphotyrosine in the 70 - , 115 - , and 130 - kD bands . The elevation was less on Pronectin - F , cor - relating with the less extensive adhesion and spreading ob - served on this substrate . We have examined the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation in several cell types in response to adhesion to fibronectin . Elevated phosphotyrosine in proteins between 115 and 130 kD were observed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells , chicken embryo fibroblasts , BHK cells ( data not shown ) , NIH 3T3 cells , and Balb / c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts . We noted , however , that NIH and Balb / c 3T3 cells were able to spread to some extent on uncoated plastic in the absence of serum and demonstrated an elevation in phosphotyrosine during this adhesion and spreading . It seemed likely that this was due to secretion by the cells of some ECM component that adsorbed to the plastic and promoted cell spreading . To pre - vent synthesis and secretion of ECM components by these cells , they were pretreated for 2 h with cycloheximide and plated in its presence . Under these conditions , cell spreading on surfaces coated with fibronectin was unaffected but cell spreading on plastic was greatly reduced . Analysis of the pattern of phosphotyrosine - containing proteins for Balb / c and NIH 3T3 cells is shown in Fig . 4 .

Cells were plated on fibronectin - coated coverslips in serum - free media for 75 rain ( , 4 and B ) or 20 h ( C - F ) . The cells were stained for phosphotyrosine ( A , C , and E ) and talin ( B , D , and F ) to reveal the focal adhesions . Note that the most prominent phosphotyrosine localization is in the focal adhesions . However , the phosphotyrosine is often more prominent in the peripheral adhesions relative to the more central ones . In some of these the phosphotyrosine staining is less extensive ( arrows in C and E ) than the staining for talin . Bar = 20 # m . pension conditions , both cell types revealed an elevation in phosphotyrosine in a doublet of bands in the 115 - 130 - kD range in response to adhesion to fibronectin . On plastic a low level of tyrosine phosphorylation was detected . Similar pat - terns of tyrosine phosphorylation were obtained in Western blots performed with two different anti - phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies , py20 and Irlg ~ .

After 1 h the cells were lysed and pp125 F A K was immunoprecipitated in paral - lel from both cell lysates . The immunoprecipitates were ana - lyzed by Western blotting with ~ 25I - py20 ( Fig . 5 , lanes I and 2 ) . Tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125 FAK was prominent in the cells plated on fibronectin but not detected in the cells kept in suspension . Parallel Western blots with anti - pp125 F ^ K indicated that equal amounts of pp125 F A K were im - munoprecipitated from cells in suspension and cells plated on fibronectin . We conclude that one of the proteins contain - ing elevated phosphotyrosine in response to adhesion of cells to fibronectin is pp125 rAK . It occurred to us that the 70 - kD phosphoprotein in the REF52 might be paxillin , a focal adhesion protein that is a known substrate for the tyrosine kinase , pp60 . . . . ( Glenney and Zokas , 1989 ) , as well as a phosphotyrosine - containing protein in normal cells during development ( Turner , 1991 ) . To test whether this 70 - kD protein might be paxillin , REF52 were kept in suspension or plated on fibronectin - coated dishes for 0 . 5 , 1 , or 8 h . The cells were lysed and the phos - photyrosine - containing proteins immunoprecipitated with py20 . These phosphotyrosine - containing proteins were re - leased from the py20 with phenylphosphate and then immu - noprecipitated with anti - paxillin . These immunoprecipitates were run on an SDS gel , transferred to nitrocellulose , and blotted with py20 ( Fig . 6 ) . The cells in suspension contained very little paxillin that was phosphorylated on tyrosine , but the level of phosphotyrosine in paxillin increased markedly Figure 3 . Attachment to various ECM components induces elevated levels of phosphotyrosine in the same set of proteins . REF52 were plated for 1 h on tissue culture plastic ( lane 1 ) , fibronectin ( lane 2 ) , the 105 - kD fibronectin fragment ( lane 3 ) , laminin ( lane 4 ) , vi - tronectin ( lane 5 ) , or Pronectin - F ( lane 6 ) .

The molecular masses of marker proteins are indicated in kilodaltons to the left of the autoradiograph . over the time course of cell adhesion to fibronectin , thus confirming the identity of the 70 - kD band as paxillin . To quantitate the level of tyrosine phosphorylation on pax - illin , REF52 were metabolically labeled with [ 3 ~ S ] methio - nine for 36 h . The cells were kept in suspension for 1 h to reduce phosphotyrosine levels to a minimum and then plated on fibronectin for 1 h before lysis . The lysate was divided into two : one half was immunoprecipitated with anti - paxillin and the other half was immunoprecipitated with the anti - phosphotyrosine antibody , py20 . The immunoprecipitations were repeated three times to insure that all of the paxillin and all of the phosphotyrosine - containing proteins were precipi - tated . The immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on an SDS gel . After drying the gel and autoradiography , the bands corresponding to paxillin were cut out and the radio - activity was determined by scintillation counting . Counts were 1 , 004 and 4 , 344 cpm from the py20 and paxillin im - munoprecipitations , respectively . Thus , comparison of the amounts of paxillin precipitated with py20 and with anti - paxillin indicated that 23 % of the paxillin had become phos - phorylated on tyrosine in response to cell adhesion to fibronectin for 1 h . A phosphotyrosine - containing band in the region ofpaxil - lin is less obvious in the Balb / c 3T3 cells plated on fibronec - tin than it is in the NIH 3T3 cells or in the REF52 cells ( Fig . 4 ) . This could be because the level of paxillin is lower in the Balb / c 3T3 cells . To analyze directly whether there is a change in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in response to adhesion in these cells , Balb / c 3T3 cells were ei - ther kept in suspension or plated on fibronectin . After 1 h the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with py20 . The immunoprecipitates were released with phenylphosphate Burridge et al .

The major bands exhibiting phosphory - lation on tyrosine in whole cell extracts of REF52 reveal only trace amounts of tyrosine phosphorylation in extracts of her - bimycin A - treated REF52 plated on fibronectin for 1 h . Using 220 nM herbimycin A resulted in a decreased level of tyrosine phosphorylation that was intermediate between the levels for untreated cells and cells in 875 nM herbimycin A ( data not shown ) . Cells treated with 55 nM herbimycin A and DMSO - treated cells showed no difference from control conditions ( data not shown ) . The specific effect of 875 nM herbimycin A on the phosphorylation of pp125 F ^ K is shown in Fig . 5 ( lane 3 ) . The level of phosphorylation of pp125 F A K is comparable to that in cells kept in suspension without plating . REF52 spread on fibronectin in the presence of 875 nM herbimycin A , although spreading was less extensive than that seen in untreated controls . The formation and organiza - tion of focal adhesions in the presence and absence of her - bimycin A was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against phosphotyrosine , talin , and paxillin ( Fig . 9 ) . Optimal comparison of focal adhesion staining be - tween herbimycin A - treated cells and untreated cells was achieved by selecting only treated cells with the most normal morphology and spreading for inclusion in these figures . Consistent with the Western blot analysis indicating de - creased tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of 875 nM herbimycin A , anti - phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed significantly decreased staining in treated cells . With py20 , many of the cells treated with herbimycin A showed little fo - cal adhesion staining . The staining that remained was most prominent in the perinuclear region and at the cell periphery ( Fig . 9 , A and B ) . Double - labeling with anti - taiin antibody was used in these same cells to determine whether the dimin - ished phosphotyrosine staining seen in focal adhesions with herbimycin A treatment was associated with decreased focal adhesion assembly ( Fig . 9 , C and D ) . Many herbimycin A - treated cells showed a marked decrease in focal adhesions as judged by taiin staining . Anti - paxillin antibody staining corroborated this paucity or complete loss of focal adhesions in many of the cells treated with herbimycin A ( Fig . 9 , Eand F ) . Actin cytoskeletai organization in response to cell adhe - sion was also disrupted in these cells as evidenced by sparse actin filaments ( stress fibers ) in cells stained with rbodamine - conjugated phalloidin ( Fig . 9 , G and H ) . The effects of lower concentrations of herbimycin A were also explored . REF52 pretreated with and plated in the presence of 220 nM her - bimycin A also showed decreased formation of focal adhe - sions and stress fibers compared with untreated cells ( data not shown ) . However , the inhibition was less pronounced than that obtained with 875 nM herbimycin A . Cells treated with 55 nM herbimycin A or with DMSO alone showed no detectable changes in the patterns of phosphotyrosine , talin , paxillin , and actin as compared with untreated controls ( data not shown ) . The reversibility of the herbimycin A effects was also in - vestigated . After pretreatment with 875 nM herbimycin A for 24 h and plating for 1 h on fibronectin in the presence of herbimycin A , coverslips were rinsed and returned to nor - mal medium without serum .

The effects of herbimycin A on fully spread cells was also examined . REF52 were treated with 875 nM herbimycin A 24 h after plating . After both 24 and 48 h of herbimycin A treatment , these cells con - tinued to show prominent stress fibers and focal adhesions , but showed reduced levels of phosphotyrosine in their focal adhesions ( data not shown ) . Discussion It has been shown recently that clustering of integrins on the surface of cells or binding of integrins to ECM ligands stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins that are distinct from the integrin t ~ and / 5 chains themselves ( Guan et al . , 1991 ; Kornberg et al . , 1991 ) . In this paper we have identified two of these proteins that become tyrosine - phosphorylated in response to cell adhesion to ECM ligands . One of these proteins , pp125 FAr , is a novel tyrosine kinase that is concentrated in focal adhesions ( Schaller et al . , 1992 ) . It is possible that this kinase is responsible for the in - creased tyrosine phosphorylation induced by adhesion and detected in the focal adhesions of spread cells . However , a direct association between pp125 ~ AK and integrins has yet to be demonstrated . Additionally , pp125 FAK may not be the primary kinase , but instead a substrate for some other tyro - sine kinase . In this respect , it should be noted that in ceils transformed by Rous sarcoma virus , pp125 rat is a substrate for the tyrosine kinase pp60 ~ - ' r ~ ( Kanner et al . , 1990 ) , which is also concentrated in focal adhesions . The second protein with elevated phosphotyrosine in ceils adhering to fibronectin that we have identified is paxillin . Paxillin is a vinculin - binding protein concentrated in focal adhesions ( Turner et al . , 1990 ) . Paxillin is also one of the major tyrosine kinase substrates in developing tissues ( Turner , 1991 ) . This finding , together with the absence of tyrosine phosphorylation on paxillin in adult tissues , is con - sistent with our current observations that suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin is associated with the formation of cytoskeleton - membrane attachments , rather than with the stabilization and maintenance of these struc - tures . One possible role for the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin is the generation of a binding site that is recognized by a src homology 2 domain in another protein , src homol - ogy 2 domains have been identified in several proteins in - volved in signal transduction and have been shown to bind to phosphotyrosine residues within specific sequences of other proteins ( Koch et al . , 1991 ) . Tyrosine phosphorylation regulates this interaction . Recently , a src homology 2 do - main has been identified within tensin , an actin - binding , fo - cal adhesion protein ( Davis et al . , 1991 ) . It will be important to determine whether there is an interaction between paxillin and tensin , or another focal adhesion protein , that is regu - lated by this tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin . Such an interaction could be instrumental in triggering the assembly of the actin cytoskeleton as focal adhesions develop . The tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin has also been de - tected in cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus ( Glenney and Zokas , 1989 ) . Since transformation of cells by Rous sar - coma virus is associated with disruption of focal adhesions , elevated phosphotyrosine in focal adhesion proteins has usu - ally been thought of in terms of focal adhesion disassembly . However , we present here three lines of evidence indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in cytoskeletal as - sembly rather than disassembly in normal cells spreading on an ECM substrate . First , the increase in phosphotyrosine is induced by adhesion and spreading and not by detachment of cells from the ECM . Second , there is the observation that in some cells the more central and mature focal adhesions stain less strongly for phosphotyrosine than the focal adhe - sions at the cell periphery ( Fig . 1 ) . Typically , focal adhesions form at the cell periphery ( Izzard and Lochner , 1980 ; Depasquale and Izzard , 1987 ) , indicating that it is the newly formed adhesions that contain elevated phosphotyrosine . Third , treatment of cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A interfered with the increase in tyrosine phos - phorylation in response to cell adhesion to fibronectin and also inhibited the formation of focal adhesions and their as - sociated stress fibers in many cells . It should be noted that cells that had already spread and developed focal adhesions and stress fibers before herbimycin A treatment continued to show these structures after the addition of herbimycin A , This further suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation is in - volved in the initial formation of these structures and not in their maintenance . Although our evidence indicates a role for tyrosine phos - phorylation in the formation of focal adhesions , tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins is not sufficient for focal adhesions to develop . Cells plated on the cell - binding frag - ment of fibronectin adhere , spread , and reveal elevated phos - photyrosine in the same proteins as cells plated on intact fibronectin ( Fig . 3 ) . However , on the cell - binding fragment of fibronectin , cells fail to develop normal focal adhesions ( Izzard et al . , 1986 ; Woods et al . , 1986 ; our unpublished ob - servations ) . In addition to the cell - binding fragment of fibronectin , a heparin - binding fragment is also required for focal adhesions to develop . Woods and Couchman have presented evidence that the heparin - binding fragment of fibronectin exerts its effect by activating protein kinase C ( Woods and Couchman , 1992 ) . It appears , therefore , that at least two signals are required for the formation of focal adhe - sions , one involving protein kinase C and the other involving tyrosine kinase activation . Tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be useful in defining a di - rect or indirect role for specific kinases in the adhesion - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins . In this paper we have concentrated on the tyrosine kinase in - hibitor herbimycin A , a widely effective inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity ( Uehara et al . , 1989 ; Fukazawa et ai . , 1990 ; June et al . , 1990 ; Iwasaki et al . , 1992 ; Otani et al . , 1992 ; Weiss and Nuccitelli , 1992 ) . However , in preliminary work we have also observed inhibition of focal adhesion formation in REF52 by various tyrphostins ( Romer , L . H . , unpub - lished results ) . Whereas the tyrphostins are competitive in - hibitors of tyrosine kinases , herbimycin A inhibits pp60 v - ~ by binding of reactive sulfhydryl groups on pp60 v - ~ to the benzoquinone moiety of the inhibitor and blocking the avail - ability of an active site ( Uehara et al . , 1989 ; Fukazawa et al . , 1990 ) . The effects of herbimycin A that we report here in - clude the inhibition of adhesion - induced tyrosine phos - phorylation of focal adhesion proteins including pp125 F ^ K and paxillin ; the inhibition of focal adhesion formation ; and Burridgr et al . Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Focal Adhesion Assembly 901 on J une 26 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 15 , 1992 interference with stress fiber assembly in normal cells plated on fibronectin . It will be important to determine whether herbimycin A has a direct effect on pp125 F A K activity , or whether it is affecting some other kinase that is active earlier in the signaling cascade and is directly triggered by integrin clustering or occupancy . The use of a panel of tyrosine ki - nase inhibitors with different specificities may be useful in delineating the cascade of events leading to the phosphoryla - tion of pp125 F A K and paxillin , and to the formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers in response to adhesion to ECM . Herbimycin A and other more specific tyrosine kinase in - hibitors may also be instrumental in determining the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in other adhesion - induced events , such as anchorage - dependent growth behavior . The basis for this requirement for adhesion to a substrate in order for nor - mal cells to respond to growth factors by DNA replication and cell division has been an enigma , although various possi - ble explanations have been advanced ( see Burridge , 1986 , for a review ) . Anchorage dependence of growth has recently been correlated with the level of intracellular pH ( Ingber et al . , 1990 ; Schwartz et al . , 1989 , 1990a , b ; 1991 ) . An addi - tional or alternative hypothesis is that adhesion - induced phosphotyrosine - containing proteins may serve a role in growth control as well as in cytoskeletal organization . We thank Drs .
