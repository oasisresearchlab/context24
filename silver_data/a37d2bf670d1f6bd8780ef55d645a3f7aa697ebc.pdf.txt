Popel oversaw the review of this article . Abstract — A critical step in metastases formation is cancer - cell invasion through tissue . During invasion , cells change morphology and apply forces to their surroundings . We have previously shown that single , metastatic breast - cancer cells will mechanically indent a synthetic , impenetrable polyacry - lamide gel with physiological - stiffness in attempted invasion ; benign breast cells do not indent the gels . In solid tumors , e . g . , breast cancers , metastases occur predominantly by collective cell - invasion . Thus , here we evaluate the effects of cell proximity on mechanical invasiveness , speciﬁcally through changes in gel indention . Gel indentation is induced by 56 , 33 and 2 % ( in > 1000 cells ) , respectively , of adjacent high metastatic potential ( MP ) , low MP and benign breast cells , being double the amounts observed in single , well - separated cells . Single cells exhibited a distribution of indentation depths below 10 l m , while adjacent cells also showed a second peak of deeper indentations . The second peak included 65 % of indenting high MP cells as compared to 15 % in the low MP cells , illustrating the difference in their invasiveness . Thus , proximity of the metastatic cells enhances their mechanical ability to invade , demonstrating why collective cancer - cell migration is likely more efﬁcient . This could potentially provide a rapid , quantitative approach to identify metastatic cells , and to determine their metastatic potential .

INTRODUCTION Cancer is the third cause of death worldwide , where metastases are the main cause of patient mortality . A critical step in formation of metastases is the invasion of cancer cells that have detached from the tumor , through the surrounding tissue . During invasion , migrating cancer cells can move through the extracel - lular matrix ( ECM ) , between neighboring cells , and in tissue or blood vessels . During this process the cancer cells change morphology and apply forces to their surroundings . 9 , 16 , 26 Those forces depend on the cell and cancer type and the stiffness of surrounding microenvironment . 35 , 43 , 44 The ECM surrounding the cells affects invasion , and substrate rigidity has been shown to regulate cancer cell invasiveness at the pri - mary tumor site 40 , 45 ; the ECM mechanics correlates with tumor grade , subtype , and aggression in human breast cancer . 3 As previously shown by our lab , me - tastatic cells will apply larger forces on stiffer , elastic , and impenetrable substrates 47 , indenting the substrates in attempted invasion . 38 , 39 Cell invasion combines both biochemical and biomechanical interactions of the migrating cells with their environment . Invading cells typically require a degradable ECM to modify as they migrate ( mes - enchymal migration mode 27 ) and / or an ECM with pores that are large enough for the cells to squeeze through ( amoeboid mode 41 ) while they may concur - rently remodel the ECM . 22 Highly invasive cancer cells have an enhanced ability to sense ( and affect ) the rigidity of their surroundings 33 and can readily switch between the mesenchymal and the amoeboid migration modes . 50 These migration modes , and especially amoeboid motion , require cell ﬂexibility and an ability for rapid morphological changes . In amoeboid migration , cell movement includes formation of roun - ded membrane blebbs and elongated protrusions , 54 similar to our previous observations when cells indent a synthetic gel . 39 To rapidly morph , cells must be pli - able and dynamic , both externally and internally . Correspondingly , highly migratory and invasive cancer cells have been shown to be externally softer than low metastatic potential and benign cells . 14 , 30 , 59 In parallel , Address correspondence to Daphne Weihs , Faculty of Biomedical Engineering , Technion - Israel Institute of Technology , Haifa 3200003 , Israel . Electronic mail : daphnew @ technion . ac . il Annals of Biomedical Engineering ( (cid:2) 2017 ) DOI : 10 . 1007 / s10439 - 017 - 1814 - 8 (cid:2) 2017 Biomedical Engineering Society as we have previously shown , the internal environment of highly metastatic cells is more dynamic and their cytoskeleton is more sparse than both low metastatic potential ( MP ) and benign cells , 26 , 28 and the high MP cells are also more receptive to internalizing materials from their surroundings . 25 The enhanced , dynamic pliability of the metastatic cancer cells facilitates their invasion through small pores , as was evaluated by in vitro Boyden chamber invasion experiments . 5 , 6 While metastatic cells are soft and ﬂexible , we and others have shown that they are also able to modify their cytoskeleton and apply localized forces to the substrate , either adhesive ( traction ) or invasive ( indent - ing ) . 17 , 37 – 39 , 42 , 60 The adhesive , traction forces applied by cells have typically been measured in 2 - dimensions ( 2D ) using synthetic , elastic , polyacrylamide gels . Those gels are produced as a ﬂat substrate with sub - micron ﬂuo - rescent particles at it surface 2 , 4 , 9 or as ﬂexible posts , 24 both coated with ECM - molecules to facilitate cell adhesion . As cells adhere to the gels and anchor them - selves they deform the surfaces or posts , with the amount of deformation directly correlated with the force , which is calculated using traction force microscopy ( TFM ) ; this has typically been done for monolayers in the con - text of migration or transmigration , or for single cells interacting with their substrates . Traction forces were shown to increase with gel stiffness and collagen - coating density , with metastatic cells also generating larger tractions than non - metastatic cells . 11 , 36 In contrast to the more typically observed , lateral traction forces , we have recently identiﬁed forces applied by metastatic breast cancer cells normal to the substrate , resulting in indentation of the gel . 17 , 38 , 39 Small indentations ( < 1 l m ) have previously been observed in non - cancerous cells , 15 , 31 likely as a result of lateral traction forces . In contrast , the breast cancer cells evaluated in our previous studies and in the current work have in - duced indentations up to 10 l m , on the scale of the cell diameter ( 10 – 20 l m ) . While the mechanical interactions of cancer cells with their environment have been evalu - ated in single cells , most invasive solid tumors predom - inantly display collective invasion . 12 In collective invasion , cells migrate together and invade their sur - roundings while remaining physically or functionally connected . 21 Collective invasion of tumor cells is similar to single - cell migration , but also has important differ - ences . 20 , 23 , 63 Whereas the molecular mechanisms of collective cancer invasion depend on cancer cells’ phe - notype and extra - cellular environment , 34 all invading cells need to physically change morphology and push through their microenvironment . 29 Here , we evaluated the eﬀect of the proximity of cancer cells on their ability to apply force and indent the underlying gels . We seeded cells at high density , gener - ating groups of adjacent cells , and evaluated the changes in cell morphology and indentation induced in the ini - tially ﬂat gel . We compared the percentage of cells that induce indentations and the indentation depths attained by groups of cells vs . those achieved by single cells . We observe that proximity of the cancer cells enhances their ability to indent the gels . Speciﬁcally , the percentage of indenting adjacent cells doubled relative to well - spaced single cells ( for both the high and the low MP cells evaluated here ) , and the indentation depth also increased ; benign cells do not signiﬁcantly indent gels in either conﬁguration . Moreover , we observe measur - able diﬀerences in amounts of indenting cells and the attained depths between the high and the low metastatic potential cells . Thus , the proximity of the cells aﬀects their invasiveness and the gel indentation assay may potentially be used to classify the malignancy and invasiveness of cancer cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture We have used three commercially - available human , epithelial breast cell lines : breast cancer cells from lung metastases with high metastatic potential ( MDA - MB - 231 , all cells from ATCC , Manassas , VA ) and with low MP ( MDA - MB - 468 ) , and benign breast cells ( MCF - 10A ) as control . Cells were cultured in their appro - priate media as recommended by the manufacturer . For the MDA - MB - 231 and the MDA - MB - 468 cell lines we used Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) ( Gibco , Invitrogen life technologies , Carls - bad , CA ) supplemented with 10 vol . % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Hyclone , ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc , Wal - tham , MA ) , 1 vol . % each of L - glutamine , penicillin – streptomycin and sodium pyruvate ( all from Biological Industries , Kibbutz Beit Haemek , Israel ) . For the MCF - 10A cell line the media included 1 : 1 vol : vol DMEM and F12 ( Biological Industries , Israel ) , sup - plemented with 5 vol . % horse serum ( Hyclone , Ther - moFisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA ) , 0 . 05 vol . % Hydrocortisone , 0 . 01 vol . % Cholera toxin , 0 . 1 vol . % Insulin ( all from Sigma , St Louis , MO ) , 1 vol . % penicillin streptomycin , 1 vol . % L - Glutamine ( both from Biological Industries , Israel ) , and 0 . 01 vol . % Human EGF ( Peprotech Asia , Israel ) . Polyacrylamide Hydrogel Preparation The polyacrylamide ( PAM ) gels were prepared at physiological stiﬀness ( Young’s modulus 2400 Pa 43 ) according to an established protocol . 17 , 38 , 39 , 47 In short , gels were prepared on glass coverslips number 5 thick - ness , 30 mm diameter ( Menzel , Germany ) , with con - stant ratio of the monomers : Acryl and the cross - linker Y . M ERKHER AND D . W EIHS BIS - acrylamide ( both from Bio - rad , Israel ) , and water ; speciﬁcally , we used 34 l l of 40 vol . % acrylamide and 3 . 8 l l of 2 vol . % BIS acrylamide in 203 l l of distilled water . Polymerization was initiated with ammonium persulfate and catalyzed with tertiary aliphatic amine N , N , N’ , N’ - tetramethylethylenediamine ( both from Sigma , St Louis , MO ) . Red ﬂuorescent ( excitation / emission 580 / 605 nm ) carboxylated polystyrene parti - cles ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) , 200 nm in diameter , were embedded in the gel just below its surface by performing slow gelation at 2 (cid:3) C during centrifugation . 52 , 53 Finally , the surface of the gel was shortly activated with Sulfo - SANPAH ( Pierce , Thermo Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA ) , washed with HEPES , and coated with 0 . 005 mg / ml rat tail collagen type I ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) for cell adhesion . The Young’s modulus ( E ) of the gels was deter - mined with a TA Instruments AR - G2 rheometer ( New Castle , DE ) using a 2 - cm parallel plate ﬁxture by the following relation : E = 2 G * ( 1 + m ) and performing dynamic , frequency and strain sweeps . 39 , 47 The com - plex shear modulus , G * , was measured by the rheometer and was effectively equal to the elastic modulus G ¢ , indicating an elastic material . 49 The Poisson’s ratio , m , is 0 . 49 for PAM gels . 8 Rheology measurements of a wide range of polyacrylamide hydrogels have previously been shown to correlate perfectly with localized mechanical properties of the gels , as measured using AFM . 1 In addition , polyacry - lamide gels have previously been shown to be homo - geneous and to possess remarkably linear mechanical properties , again determined by comparing rheology and AFM measurements . 10 Thus , we consider the gels to have the same Young’s modulus at all locations . Cell Staining Calcein - AM ﬂuorometric assay ( BioVision , USA ) was used for viability staining , 62 where the compound easily penetrates the cytoplasms of intact and live cells . Hydrolysis of Calcein - AM by intracellular esterases produces ﬂuorescence in the cell cytoplasm which can be observed at excitation / emission of 485 / 530 nm starting at 30 min after staining . Hoechst 33342 assay ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) was used for live - cell nucleus staining , 55 where an enzymatic reaction results in ﬂu - orescent labeling ( excitation / emission 346 / 460 nm ) of the nucleus after 1 – 2 h of incubation . Microscopy and Imaging The imaging was done with an inverted , epiﬂuo - rescence Olympus IX81 microscope , using a 60 9 / 0 . 7NA diﬀerential interference contrast ( DIC , No - marsky optics ) air - immersion , long working - distance objective lens . The cells were maintained in 37 (cid:3) C , 5 % CO 2 , and high humidity ( 90 % ) throughout the entire experiment to sustain their viability . Imaging and indentation depth measurements were started approx - imately 45 min after seeding to allow cell attachment . Each gel was imaged in at least 9 , randomly chosen , ﬁelds - of - view . The focal depth of each image was recorded independently during the experiment , using an automated microscope stage connected to a com - puter and accessed by a custom MATLAB module . We seeded 300 , 000 cells on each gel within their respective media , resulting in an average of 19 ± 5 cells per ﬁeld - of - view ( area of 0 . 016 mm 2 ) ; the cells and gels are immersed in media which reaches 1 cm above gel height to prevent any surface tension or evaporation effects . The cells are adjacent and / or touching , yet typically remain in a monolayer . We deﬁne cells as adjacent when they are closely situated to , yet not overlapping , at least one other cell ; cells at distances FIGURE 1 . Representative image of adjacent high metastatic potential cells indenting a 2400 Pa polyacrylamide gel . ( a ) DIC image of cells on the gel ; ( b ) ﬂuorescence image of particles at the gel surface ; the numbers on the image represent the indentation depths ( l m ) of each indenting cell , obtained by the difference between the focal heights of the gel and the lowest point where particles are in focus . Scale bar is 20 l m . Proximity of Metastatic Cells Enhances Their Mechanobiological Invasiveness larger than cell size were not considered adjacent . 2 , 56 Cell groups were typically < 9 cells with 1 – 6 immedi - ately - adjacent ( proximate ) indenting cells . Indentation Depth Determination Images were analyzed using a custom - designed module 39 in MATLAB 2012b ( The Mathworks , Nat - tick , MA ) to determine the number of viable and indenting cells , as well as the indentation depth of each cell ( Fig . 1 ) ; we determined the number of indenting cells out of the total adhered cells . At each measure - ment time - point and randomly chosen location on the gel , at least 3 images were acquired : ( i ) a DIC image of the cells on the gel , ( ii ) a ﬂuorescence image of the particles embedded at the focal plane of the gel surface , and ( iii ) a series of ﬂuorescence images at the lowest focal depth where particles are observed , to identify each indenting cells’ depth . We typically imaged 5 – 6 focal depths below the gel - surface height , where 1 – 8 indenting cells were in focus at each depth ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Materials , Fig . S1 ) . The indentation depth was then calculated by the difference in focal depths between the ﬂuorescence image at the ( unin - dented ) gel surface and at the lowest focal plane where particles are in focus , i . e . , at the bottom of the speciﬁc indenting cell . To demonstrate that the changes in fo - cal depth of the particles embedded in the gel surface correlate with indentations caused by cells , we provide confocal images and side views of the gels with indenting cells ( Fig . S2 ) . The indentation depths of 355 and 506 adjacent , respectively , high and low MP cells , were calculated from at least 6 separate experiments each ( see Table S1 ) . Results for indenting single high and low MP cells were adapted from our previous works , 17 , 39 averaging , respectively , 84 and 41 single cells in 4 separate experiments . We provide only on the inden - tation depths in the current analysis , without approx - imating the inducing force as that would require a yet unavailable model . In single cells the force applied to the substrate may be estimated using a Hertz model of a rigid sphere 17 , 38 , 39 ; this is appropriate due to the cell shape and nucleus placement . However , when cells are adjacent , they synergistically interact and change morphology and the assumptions for the Hertz model do not apply . Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed to compare between the cells with high or low metastatic potential and to compare adjacent and single cells of the same type . We used the general , linear mixed model is a multivariate regression method that helps to generalize the analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) . 18 In all cases , sta - tistical signiﬁcance was determined when the p value was less than 0 . 05 . RESULTS We have evaluated the indentations induced on 2400 Pa PAM gels by groups of closely situated , non - aggregated cells ( Figs . 1 and S2 ) . We evaluated the number of indenting cells and the indentation depths of each cell within the group , comparing high meta - static potential , low MP , and benign cells . We observed that 56 and 33 % , of high MP and low MP cells , respectively , indented the gels ; negligible amounts of benign cells indented , similar to our previous observations using single cells . 39 Interestingly , for both metastatic cell types , the percentage of indenting cells that are densely seeded and organized in groups is approximately double the percentage of single indent - ing cells ( Fig . 2 ) . We note that the cells in groups are viable ( Fig . S3 ) throughout the experiment ( up to 6 h ) . In addition to the increase in percentage of indenting cells , adjacent cells attain larger indentation depths than single cells , likely by synergistic interactions ; the number of neighboring cells did not appear to correlate with obtained depths ( not shown ) . We observe that the indentation depths of the adjacent cells did not change during the observation time . This is in contrast to our previous observations with single cells , 39 and could indicate different ener - getic capabilities of single cells vs . clusters . We have measured the indentation depths of each indenting cell within adjacent cell groups starting at 45 min after seeding and up to 6 h ( Fig . S4 ) . The indentation depths at early and late times were statistically indistinguish - able ( p > 0 . 19 ) for both high and low MP cells ; we evaluated at least 160 indenting cells in groups at each time point for each cell line . Hence , we merge the re - sults of adjacent cells from all experiment times to improve statistics ; cells may move on the gel and thus the imaged cells may differ between time points , making the results effectively independent . While the single cells 39 exhibited a single - peak Gaussian - like distribution of indentation depths , adjacent cells exhibited two peaks , below and above 10 l m , with the lower range overlapping with that of the single cells ( Fig . 3 ) . The indentation depths in - duced by the single , well - spaced , high and low MP cells were < 10 l m and their averages were statistically indistinguishable ( p > 0 . 3 ) ; averages of the indenta - tion - depth distributions are provided in Table S1 . In contrast , the adjacent cells exhibited a distribution with ( at least ) two peaks separated by a minima at 10 l m , which is the highest indentation depth of single Y . M ERKHER AND D . W EIHS cells . Interestingly , the ﬁrst peak of the adjacent cells was slightly lower than that of the single cells for both high and low MP cells ( see Table S2 for statistical analysis ) , yet the minima overlap at 10 l m . We observe that the high and low MP cell lines diﬀer when seeded densly and group indentation ensue ( Fig . 3c ) . The higher metastatic potential cells induce deeper indentations in groups , as compared to the low MP cells . Speciﬁcally , about 65 % of the indenting high MP cells exhibit indentation depths at the higher range of indentations ( > 10 l m ) , while only 15 % of the indenting low MP cells exhibit depths in the second peak ; in the single cells the cell amounts and indenta - tion depths were indistinguishable . This may indicate different capabilities and synergistic interactions between adjacent high and low MP cells . DISCUSSION We observe that close proximity of metastatic can - cer cells increases their ability and propensity to forcefully indent soft , elastic , impenetrable gels , likely in attempted invasion ; in a recent work , we show that mechanical indentations correlate with cell motility and invasiveness through a Boyden chamber . 7 When seeded on collagen - coated gels with 2400 Pa stiffness , a subset of the metastatic cells will indent , but not cross the gel , as it is non - degradable . It is important to note that the forces applied by cells during gel indentation are sensitive to both substrate stiffness and ECM - li - gand coating type and density . 61 We and others have shown that increased gel stiffness using collagen coat - ing induces stronger , cell - applied traction forces , as does increased collagen density 36 , 47 ; the increased force generation is directly mediated by enhanced cell spreading . Hydrogel coating with other ECM ligands , e . g . , ﬁbronectin , has been shown to induce comparable traction forces to collagen coating 46 and even to pro - mote cell invasion , 48 hence we expect similar and even enhanced indentations with different gel coatings . We have shown that the percentage of indenting cells doubles when seeding density is high and cells are adjacent and in close contact , as compared to single , well - spaced cells ; benign cells do not indent the gels regardless of seeding density . In addition , the inden - tation depths attained by adjacent cells are higher , suggesting synergistic cell interactions with neighbor - ing cells and with the substrate . We note that this synergistic , mechanobiological eﬀect of cell proximity appears to be ampliﬁed in the high metastatic potential cells ( as compared to the low MP cells ) , likely corre - lating with and facilitating their increased invasiveness . We observe that more of the adjacent cells indent gels and are able to reach larger indentation depths than the single cells . In general , the measured inden - tation depths of both the single metastatic cells and clusters are an order of magnitude greater than dimples previously observed to be induced by non - cancerous cells while spreading 31 or crawling . 15 It is important to note that the indentation depths observed here do not result from cell weight effects ( gravitation ) on the 2400 Pa gels , as the benign cells do not indent the gels to any measurable depth . We have also previously FIGURE 2 .

Scale bar is 10 l m . FIGURE 3 . Distribution of indentation depths of all indenting cells . ( a ) Adjacent ( dark bars ) and single ( light bars ) high metastatic potential cells ; ( b ) adjacent ( dark bars ) and single ( light bars ) low MP cells ; ( c ) comparison of adjacent high ( green bars ) and low ( red bars ) MP cells . All single cells re - sults adapted from Kristal - Muscal et al . 39 Dashed line marks the local minima of the distribution of adjacent cells at 10 l m . Proximity of Metastatic Cells Enhances Their Mechanobiological Invasiveness estimated gravitational indentation due to a single cell to be on the scale of 1 . 2 9 10 2 16 l m , which is 16 – 17 orders of magnitude smaller than the indentation depths observed here . 2 While single cell indentations were limited to < 10 l m , adjacent cells induced a sec - ond indentation - depth peak centered on ~ 13 l m . Interestingly , we are able to distinguish between the high and low MP cells based on the amounts of cells attain the larger indentation depths . Speciﬁcally , we have observed 65 % of the high MP clusters with in - dentations > 10 l m , as compared to only 15 % of the low MP cells . A similar phenomenon was recently observed during in vivo cancer - cell migration , 51 where the velocities of single highly invasive ( MDA - MB - 231 ) and more moderately invasive ( TN1 ) breast cancer cells did not signiﬁcantly differ , yet the adjacent cells of the highly invasive cells exhibited signiﬁcantly larger velocity . A recent work from our lab directly correlates the two phenomena of cell motility and mechanical , gel indentations . 7 Thus , the more invasive cells exhibit increased aggressiveness when clustered both in vivo and in vitro , as demonstrated by motility and inva - siveness , i . e . , indentation capacity . The doubling percentage of indenting adjacent cells and the increased indentation depth are a strong indi - cation of an increase in the invasive capacity of adjacent cells . Such groups have previously been shown to be more invasive , with cells collectively migrating as loosely adhered groups , sheets , and clusters . 13 Ampliﬁed inva - siveness of clusters of cancer cells was demonstrated when , for example , more metastases formed in mice in - jected with clumps of tumor cells as compared to mice injected with an equal total number of single cells . 19 We 39 , 47 and others 11 have shown that ( single ) me - tastatic cancer cells apply stronger forces to stiffer microenvironments . The forces applied by single , indenting high and low metastatic breast cancer cells on 1300 Pa gels were 2 – 3 - fold smaller than those applied to a 2300 Pa gel 39 ; cells were unable to adhere properly to softer , 500 Pa gels . Similarly , the lateral traction forces exerted by the same metastatic cells increase with gel stiffness , as veriﬁed for gels 1000 – 11 , 000 Pa . 36 , 47 Moreover , dynamic stiffening of a sur - rounding hydrogel induced invasive phenotypes even in benign cells . 58 More generally , non - cancerous ﬁbroblasts preferentially migrate toward stiffer regions 45 and may adapt their stiffness to match that of their environment . 57 In cancerous ﬁbrosarcoma cells , mechanical ( magnetic ) stimulation increased the per - centage of invading cells . 48 Thus , we propose that the enhanced indentation capacity of adjacent metastatic cells observed in the current study , is related to mechanical ( tension - induced ) interactions of the cells likely through the gel ; the gels are expected to remain elastic , likely with unchanging Young’s modulus , un - der the strains applied by the cells ( not shown ) . Force application by cells , and especially such synergistic interactions likely require changes in cell morphology and intracellular structure . We have previously shown a coordinated restructuring of the metastatic cells , likely intended to facilitate force application , i . e . , remodeling the actin and the microtubules and moving the nucleus and changing its shape . 17 Coordination of actin dynamics facilitates not only cell migration and force application , but also development of cell – cell junctions in formation of clusters , 32 which could allow the cells to act together . While of great interest in many works , the exact synergistic mechanism of collectively migrating cells has yet to be elucidated . In conclusion , we have shown that adjacent meta - static cancer cells are able to more forcefully interact with their microenvironment , highlighting the increased invasiveness of clusters as compared to single cells . We have shown that the gel - indentation platform used here may potentially be used to identify the me - tastatic potential of cancer cells , to provide a sample - speciﬁc , or patient personalized , predictive prognosis . We note that the gel - platform may facilitate rapid ( few hours ) and quantitative evaluation of the metastatic potential , through the mechanobiological interaction of the cells with their substrate . Mechanobiology and speciﬁcally the mechanical interactions of cancer cells with their microenvironment can thus provide a means to elucidate important aspects in cancer cell migration and invasion , such as the collective nature of invasion .
