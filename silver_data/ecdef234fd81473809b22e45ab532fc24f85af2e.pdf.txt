In this study , we report the role of WAVE2 in the motility and invasiveness of pancre - atic cancer cells . High WAVE2 expression in human pancreatic cancer tissues was correlated with overall survival . WAVE2 accumulated in the cell protrusions of pan - creatic cancer cell lines . Downregulation of WAVE2 by small interfering RNA de - creased the cell protrusions and inhibited the motility and invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells . WAVE2 promoted pancreatic cancer cell motility and invasion by forming a complex with the actin cytoskeletal protein alpha‐actinin 4 ( ACTN4 ) . Downregulation of ACTN4 by small interfering RNA also inhibited the motility and invasiveness of the cells through a decrease in cell protrusions . Further investigation showed that WAVE2 / ACTN4 signaling selectively stimulated p27 phosphorylation and thereby increased the motility and invasiveness of the cells . These results sug - gest that WAVE2 and ACTN4 stimulate p27 phosphorylation and provide evidence that WAVE2 promotes the motility and invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells .

The present study aimed to examine WAVE2 expression in tissue samples from PDAC patients and its association with clinicopathological characteristics and survival . We also evaluated the mechanism of WAVE2 in the control of PDAC cell motility and invasion . We showed that WAVE2 induces the formation of cell protrusions through ACTN4 recruitment to filamentous actin in the protrusions and the activation of p27 , resulting in an increase in motility and invasiveness of PDAC cells . 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2 . 1 | Antibodies Anti‐WAVE2 ( sc‐373889 ) , anti‐ACTN4 ( sc‐390205 ) , and anti‐myc ( sc‐789 ) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz ( Santa Cruz , CA ) . JLA20 anti‐actin antibody ( MABT219 ) was purchased from Millipore ( Temecula , CA ) . Anti‐p27 antibody ( 25614‐1‐AP ) was purchased from Proteintech ( Chicago , IL ) . Anti‐phosphorylated p27 antibody ( ab85047 ) was purchased from Abcam ( Cambridge , MA ) . 2 . 2 | Primary human PDAC samples Tumor tissues were obtained from 102 patients who un - derwent surgical resection of PDAC between 1999 and 2014 at the Department of Surgery of Kochi Medical School Hospital ( Nankoku , Japan ) or Matsuyama Shimin Hospital ( Matsuyama , Japan ) , as published previously . 19 The clinical records of all patients were available ( Table 1 ) . Tumors were classified according to the Japanese Pancreas Society classification 20 and the International Union Against Cancer tumor‐node‐metastasis classifica - tion ( UICC TNM classification ) . 21 This study was ap - proved by the ethics review boards of Kochi Medical School and Matsuyama Shimin Hospital prior to patient recruitment . Written informed consent was acquired from each patient prior to initiation . 2 . 3 | Immunohistochemical staining Immunohistochemistry was carried out using anti‐WAVE2 antibody as published previously . 19 The immunostaining score was evaluated by two independent observers ( SN and MF ) , who were blinded to the clinical and outcome data . The staining intensity of WAVE2 was scored as : ( 1 ) weaker than the intensity of the surface staining of the is - lets of Langerhans ; ( 2 ) equal to the intensity of the islets of Langerhans ; ( 3 ) stronger than the intensity of the islets of Langerhans . The proportion of tumor cells were graded from 1 to 3 : 1 ( < 50 % ) , 2 ( 50 % ‐80 % ) , and 3 ( > 80 % ) . The total im - munohistochemical score was calculated by summing the percentage score and the intensity score . WAVE2 expres - sion was classified into two groups based on the total score ( low group , 2‐3 ; high group , 4‐6 ) with reference to previous reports . 19 , 22 2 . 4 | Cell culture The human PDAC cell line S2‐013 , a subline of SUIT‐2 , was obtained from Dr T . Iwamura ( Miyazaki Medical College , Miyazaki , Japan ) . 23 The human PDAC cell line PANC‐1 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA ) . HPNE immortalized normal pancreatic epithelial cells were a kind gift from Dr Michel Ouellette ( University of Nebraska Medical Center , Omaha , NE ) . 24 These cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( Gibco‐BRL , Carlsbad , CA ) containing 10 % fetal calf serum . 2 . 5 | Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy Immunocytochemistry was carried out as published previously . 25 2 . 6 | Small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) treatment A single mixture with four different siRNA oligonucleotides targeting WAVE2 , one with four different siRNA oligonucle - otides targeting ACTN4 , and one with four different siRNA oligonucleotides targeting p27 were purchased from Qiagen ( FlexiTube GeneSolution GS10163 , GS1027 , and GS81 , respectively ; Valencia , CA ) , and a single mixture with four different scrambled negative control siRNA oligonucleotides was obtained from Santa Cruz ( 37007 ) . S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells were transfected with each siRNA mixture in siRNA transfection reagent ( Qiagen ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . After incubation for 48 hours , total cell lysates were extracted , and immunoblotting was carried out to evalu - ate the effects of siRNA treatment . | 5735 TANIUCHI eT Al . 2 . 7 | WAVE2 rescue construct The entire coding sequence of the WAVE2 cDNA was cloned into pCMV6‐Entry vector ( Origene Technologies , Rockville , MD ) bearing a C‐terminal myc‐DDK‐tag by reverse tran - scription polymerase chain reaction of total RNA extracted from S2‐013 cells . Transient transfection of the resulting WAVE2 rescue construct was carried out with X‐tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent ( Roche , Penzberg , Germany ) . The transfected cells were typically assayed 2 days after transfection . 2 . 8 | Transwell motility assay The Transwell motility assay was carried out as published previously . 25 The assay was performed three independent times . 2 . 9 | Matrigel invasion assay The Matrigel invasion assay was carried out as published pre - viously . 25 The assay was performed three independent times . 2 . 10 | In vitro growth rate as determined with the 3‐ ( 4 , 5‐dimethylthiazol‐2‐yl ) ‐2 , 5‐ diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells transiently transfected with scrambled negative control siRNA , WAVE2 siRNA , ACTN4 siRNA , or p27 siRNA were each seeded at a concentration of 5 × 10 4 cells per well in 12‐well plates . The viability of the cells was evaluated with the MTT assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , 1 / 10 volume cell count - ing kit‐8 solution ( Dojindo , Kumamoto , Japan ) was added to each well , and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 3 hours .

Absorbance was then measured at 490 nm and at 630 nm as a reference , with a Microplate Reader 550 ( Bio‐Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 2 . 11 | Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis of WAVE2 Combined immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis using a nano‐LC‐MS / MS system ( Genomine , Inc , Pohang , Korea ) were performed as published previously . 26 2 . 12 | Immunoprecipitation S2‐013 cells were incubated on fibronectin for 5 hours and lysed in lysis buffer ( 50 mmol / L Tris [ pH 7 . 4 ] , 150 mmol / L NaCl , 1 mmol / L MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 % NP‐40 , and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets [ Roche ] , and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail [ Nacalai , Kyoto , Japan ] ) . The resulting lysates were immu - noprecipitated with anti‐WAVE2 antibody , anti‐ACTN4 antibody , or mouse IgG isotype control antibody , and Dynabeads Protein G ( Dynal , Oslo , Norway ) . After the beads were subsequently washed with wash buffer ( 50 mmol / L Tris [ pH 7 . 4 ] , 150 mmol / L NaCl , 1 mmol / L MgCl 2 , and 0 . 5 % NP‐40 ) , immune complexes were analyzed on Western blots to examine the interaction between endogenous WAVE2 and ACTN4 . 2 . 13 | Cell fractionation Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation was performed using a LysoPure Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extractor Kit ( Wako , Osaka , Japan ) as previously described . 27 , 28 2 . 14 | Phospho‐kinase array assay The Proteome Profiler Human Phospho‐Kinase Array Kit ARY003 was purchased from R & D Systems ( Minneapolis , MN ) and used according to the manufacturer’s protocol , as published previously . 29 Blots were quantified by densitometric analysis using Kodak EDAS290 image analysis software ( Kodak , Rochester , NY ) . 2 . 15 | Statistical analysis For immunohistochemical analysis , we performed statisti - cal analysis using R ( version 3 . 3 . 3 ; The R Foundation , Wien , Austria ) as published previously . 19 Fisher’s exact test was used to assess the correlation between WAVE2 expression levels and clinicopathological parameters . The Kaplan‐Meier method and log‐rank test ( Mantel‐Cox ) were carried out to calculate cumu - lative survival rates . Survival rates are expressed as the median value and interquartile range . Univariate Cox regression analy - sis was performed to determine the prognostic significance of individual clinicopathological factors . Cox proportional hazards models were used for multivariate analysis of independent factors for overall survival . For the in vitro experiments , statistical signif - icance was evaluated with Student’s t tests . P values < 0 . 05 were considered significant and indicated with asterisks in the figures . 3 | RESULTS 3 . 1 | WAVE2 expression in PDAC tissue samples The WAVE2 expression levels were examined in surgical spec - imens from 102 patients with PDAC by immunohistochemical FIGURE 1 Immunohistochemistry with anti‐WAVE2 antibody .

Immunostaining scores were used to classify patients into the low‐expressing WAVE2 group ( 72 . 5 % ; n = 74 ; total immunohistochemical score = 2 or 3 ; Figure 1A ) and the high‐expressing WAVE2 group ( 27 . 5 % ; n = 28 ; total immuno - histochemical score = 4 , 5 , or 6 ; Figure 1B , C ) . WAVE2 was not obviously present in normal pancreatic ducts ( Figure 1D ) , brain , lung , liver , or kidney ( data not shown ) . 3 . 2 | Associations of WAVE2 overexpression with clinicopathological features and prognosis The relationship between the WAVE2 expression level in PDAC tissue samples and clinicopathological vari - ables is shown in Table 2 . The overall expression score was not significantly correlated with clinicopathological variables . The overall survival time for postoperative PDAC pa - tients with WAVE2 overexpression was significantly shorter than that of PDAC patients with low WAVE2 ex - pression ( Figure 2A , B , Kaplan‐Meier curves , P < 0 . 001 ) . We examined the prognostic value of WAVE2 expression in subgroups stratified by UICC stage , age , gender , tumor size , differentiation grade , lymphatic invasion , venous in - vasion , and intrapancreatic nerve invasion . Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that stage III and IV , high WAVE2 expression , tumor size , and venous invasion were independent prognostic factors ( Table 3 ) . Furthermore , multivariate analysis revealed that stage III and IV and high WAVE2 expression were independent factors of worse overall survival ( Table 3 ) . 3 . 3 | Subcellular distribution of WAVE2 in PDAC cells grown on fibronectin Immunocytochemistry was used to investigate the subcellular localization of WAVE2 in the moderately differentiated S2‐013 PDAC cells and the poorly dif - ferentiated PANC‐1 PDAC cells . Fibronectin induces the formation of cell protrusions at the leading edge of PDAC cells . 25 S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells formed fewer cell protrusions when cultured without fibronectin than when cultured on fibronectin . 25 In S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells grown on fibronectin , WAVE2 was present in the cytoplasm of the cell bodies as well as in the cell protru - sions , each of which contained many peripheral actin structures ( Figure 3 ) . 3 . 4 | Roles of WAVE2 in the motility and invasiveness of PDAC cells WAVE2 was transiently suppressed by transfection with WAVE2 siRNA in S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells ( Figure 4A ) . An in vitro MTT assay showed that suppression of WAVE2 did not affect cell growth in S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells ( Figure 4B ) . Suppression of WAVE2 significantly inhibited cell mo - tility ( Figure 4C ) and invasion ( Figure 4D ) in S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells . The expression of myc‐tagged rescue WAVE protein was confirmed in scrambled control siRNA‐trans - fected and WAVE2 siRNA‐transfected S2‐013 cells ( Figure 4E ) . Similar to endogenous WAVE2 , the exogenous rescue WAVE protein was localized in the cytoplasm of the cell TABLE 2 Correlation between WAVE2 expression and clinicopathological parameters WAVE2 expression P Low High Percentage ( % ) Stage a 0 . 621 0 2 . 7 [ n = 2 ] 0 [ n = 0 ] IA 2 . 7 [ n = 2 ] 7 . 1 [ n = 2 ] IB 9 . 5 [ n = 7 ] 3 . 6 [ n = 1 ] IIA 29 . 7 [ n = 22 ] 35 . 7 [ n = 10 ] IIB 50 . 0 [ n = 37 ] 46 . 4 [ n = 13 ] III 2 . 7 [ n = 2 ] 0 [ n = 0 ] IV 2 . 7 [ n = 2 ] 7 . 1 [ n = 2 ] Primary tumor a 0 . 605 Tis 2 . 7 [ n = 2 ] 0 [ n = 0 ] T1 4 . 1 [ n = 3 ] 10 . 7 [ n = 3 ] T2 16 . 2 [ n = 12 ] 10 . 7 [ n = 3 ] T3 74 . 3 [ n = 55 ] 78 . 6 [ n = 22 ] T4 2 . 7 [ n = 2 ] 0 [ n = 0 ] Regional lymph nodes a 0 . 373 N0 41 . 9 [ n = 31 ] 53 . 6 [ n = 15 ] N1 58 . 1 [ n = 43 ] 46 . 4 [ n = 13 ] Distant metastasis a 0 . 302 M0 97 . 3 [ n = 72 ] 92 . 9 [ n = 26 ] M1 2 . 7 [ n = 2 ] 7 . 1 [ n = 2 ] Histology b 0 . 598 PanIN 2 . 7 [ n = 2 ] 0 [ n = 0 ] Well 31 . 1 [ n = 23 ] 28 . 5 [ n = 8 ] Moderate 56 . 7 [ n = 42 ] 53 . 6 [ n = 15 ] Poor 9 . 5 [ n = 7 ] 17 . 9 [ n = 5 ] Venous invasion b 0 . 2 v0 + v1 89 . 2 [ n = 66 ] 78 . 6 [ n = 22 ] v2 + v3 10 . 8 [ n = 8 ] 21 . 4 [ n = 6 ] Lymphatic invasion b 0 . 798 ly0 + ly1 74 . 3 [ n = 55 ] 78 . 6 [ n = 22 ] ly2 + ly3 25 . 7 [ n = 19 ] 21 . 4 [ n = 6 ] PanIN , pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia . a Classified according to the classification of International Union against Cancer b Classified according to the classification of pancreatic cancer of Japan Pancreas Society ; 5738 | TANIUCHI eT Al . bodies and in the cell protrusions of S2‐013 cells ( Figure 4F ) . The rescue WAVE protein restored cell motility and inva - siveness that was inhibited after WAVE2 silencing in S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells ( Figure 4G , H ) . Thus , our data indicate that WAVE2 promoted the motility and invasiveness of PDAC cells . FIGURE 2 Correlation between high expression of WAVE2 and poor outcome in PDAC patients .

WAVE2 immunoprecipitated with the anti‐WAVE2 antibody ( Figure 5A ) . Following SDS‐PAGE and silver staining , a specific 100‐kDa protein was detected in the anti‐WAVE2 immuno - precipitates ( Figure 5B ) . The protein band was excised , sub - jected to LC‐MS / MS analysis , and identified as ACTN4 . The peptide sequence coverage was 21 % ( Figure 5C ) . The interac - tion between WAVE2 and ACTN4 was confirmed using co‐ immunoprecipitation experiments in S2‐013 cells grown on fibronectin ( Figure 5D ) . Immunocytochemistry showed that WAVE2 and ACTN4 were co‐localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus , and a portion of WAVE2 and ACTN4 accumulated in the cell protrusions of S2‐013 cells grown on fibronectin ( Figure 5E ) . 3 . 6 | Roles of WAVE2 in the co‐localization of ACTN4 with actin polymerization Immunoprecipitation experiments showed the interaction between WAVE2 and filamentous actin in S2‐013 cells grown on fibronectin ( Figure 6A ) , indicating that actin was enriched in the WAVE2‐immunoprecipitated materi - als containing ACTN4 . Immunocytochemistry showed that the level of ACTN4 bound to the actin cytoskeleton was de - creased in WAVE2 siRNA‐transfected S2‐013 cells grown on fibronectin in comparison with the scrambled control ( Figure 6B ) . WAVE2 siRNA‐transfected S2‐013 cells expressing the rescue WAVE protein showed restored expression of ACTN4 bound to the actin cytoskeleton that was decreased after WAVE2 silencing ( Figure 6C ) . ACTN4 was transiently suppressed by transfection with ACTN4 siRNA in S2‐013 cells ( Figure 6D ) . Transfection of a WAVE2 rescue construct into ACTN4 siRNA‐transfected S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells in which WAVE2 had been sup - pressed did not increase the actin‐driven membrane protru - sions compared to S2‐013 cells without the rescue WAVE protein ( Figure 6E ) . 3 . 7 | Roles of WAVE2 and ACTN4 in forming cell protrusions We analyzed actin polymerization in the cell protrusions of S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells transfected with WAVE2 siRNA . Compared with the scrambled control , suppres - sion of WAVE2 decreased actin polymerization in the cell protrusions and significantly inhibited the formation of protrusions ( Figure 7A , B ) . Suppression of ACTN4 also decreased the level of actin polymerization in the cell pro - trusions in comparison with the scrambled control ( Figure 7C , D ) . The rescue WAVE protein restored the cell pro - trusions with peripheral actin assembly that was inhib - ited after WAVE2 silencing in S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells ( Figure 7E ) . Transfection of a WAVE2 rescue construct into ACTN4 siRNA‐transfected S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells FIGURE 3 Subcellular localization of WAVE2 in PDAC cells grown on fibronectin .

These results indicated that WAVE2 and ACTN4 cooperatively induce the actin‐driven membrane protrusions in PDAC cells . 3 . 8 | Roles of WAVE2 and ACTN4 in the motility and invasiveness of PDAC cells Silencing of ACTN4 significantly reduced cell motility ( Figure 8A ) and invasion ( Figure 8B ) of S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells . Transfection of a WAVE2 rescue construct into ACTN4 siRNA‐ transfected S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells in which WAVE2 had been suppressed did not rescue cell motility and invasion after silencing of WAVE2 and ACTN4 ( Figure 8C , D ) . These results indicated that WAVE2 and ACTN4 cooperatively promote the motility and invasiveness of PDAC cells . 3 . 9 | Association of WAVE2 and ACTN4 with cell signaling pathways To determine whether WAVE2 and ACTN4 could regulate the activity of phosphoproteins , we performed a phosphopro - tein array analysis and compared WAVE2 rescue construct‐ transfected S2‐013 cells with suppression of both WAVE2 and ACTN4 , with WAVE2 rescue construct‐transfected S2‐013 cells with suppression of WAVE2 alone ( Figure 9A , B ) . Of the 38 kinases studied , the cells transfected with ACTN4 siRNA showed inactivation of p27 compared to the cells not transfected with ACTN4 siRNA . No other kinases showed a difference in phosphorylation . 3 . 10 | Effects of WAVE2 and ACTN4 on p27 activity Immunocytochemistry showed that phosphorylated p27 was mainly present in the cytoplasm , and it was also localized in the nucleus of S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells ( Figure 10A ) . In HPNE cells , phosphorylated p27 was less abundant in the nucleus ( Figure 10A ) . Next , we prepared cellular fractions , and the amount of phospho - rylated p27 in these fractions was analyzed by immunob - lotting . Phosphorylated p27 was present in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions in S2‐013 cells , although it was obviously reduced in the nuclear fraction of HPNE cells ( Figure 10B ) . Immunoblotting showed that the suppression of WAVE2 markedly decreased the level of phosphorylated p27 com - pared to S2‐013 cells transfected with the scrambled con - trol siRNA ( Figure 10C ) . Transfection of a WAVE2 rescue construct into ACTN4 siRNA‐transfected S2‐013 cells in which WAVE2 had been suppressed did not increase the level of phosphorylated p27 ( Figure 10D ) . In contrast , WAVE2 siRNA‐transfected S2‐013 cells expressing the rescue WAVE protein showed an increased level of phos - phorylated p27 ( Figure 10D ) . These results indicated that WAVE2 and ACTN4 were necessary for regulation of p27 phosphorylation . 3 . 11 | Association of p27 with actin polymerization Following transfection with p27 siRNA or the scrambled con - trol , the level of p27 in S2‐013 cells was assessed by Western blotting ( Figure 11A ) . The p27 level was markedly reduced following ACTN4 siRNA silencing compared with the scram - bled control . p27 is a member of the Cip / Kip family of cyclin‐ dependent kinase inhibitors that function to negatively control cell cycle progression . 30 Overexpression of p27 leads to in - hibition of cell proliferation and migration of PDAC cells . 31 Similar to the results in Figure 4B , MTT assays showed that the number of S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells transfected with ACTN4 siRNA or p27 siRNA was not different com - pared with scrambled control siRNA‐transfected S2‐013 and FIGURE 4 Roles of WAVE2 in the motility and invasiveness of PDAC cells .

Transfection of a WAVE2 rescue construct into p27 siRNA‐transfected S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells in which WAVE2 had been suppressed did not restore cell motility and invasion after silencing of WAVE2 and p27 ( Figure 12C , D ) . These results indicated that WAVE2 and p27 cooperatively promote the motility and invasiveness of PDAC cells . 4 | DISCUSSION The present study showed that high WAVE2 expression is closely associated with poor prognosis of patients with PDAC . Coexpression of WAVE2 and Arp2 predicts a poor outcome in patients with invasive breast cancer and is closely associated with aggressive and invasive morphology . 32 WAVE2 is a candidate prognostic marker in liver cancer and is correlated with a poor prognosis . 33 In these reports , the in - tensity of WAVE2 staining in breast cancer or liver cancer specimens was scored without reference to normal cells . The present study is the first report of immunohistochemical analysis of WAVE2 to investigate whether expression of this protein could accurately predict the prognosis of PDAC pa - tients . The intensity of WAVE2 staining in PDAC cells was scored compared to the intensity of the islet of Langerhans as described in previous reports [ 19 , 22 ) . The overall expres - sion score of WAVE2 was not significantly correlated with the clinicopathological variables . Univariate and multivari - ate Cox regression analyses revealed that high WAVE2 ex - pression was an independent predictor of a worse survival outcome . In vitro motility and invasion assays showed that WAVE2 specifically promoted an invasive phenotype by in - ducing the formation of cell protrusions in PDAC cells . Our results indicate that WAVE2 may be a determinant of poor prognosis of PDAC patients and is functionally associated with cell motility and invasion . We recently reported that cytoplasmic RNA granules con - taining insulin‐like growth factor‐2 mRNA‐binding protein 3 ( IGF2BP3 ) ‐bound messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) accumulate in the cell protrusions of PDAC cells . 34 , 35 Locally translated IGF2BP3‐bound mRNAs in PDAC cell protrusions induce the formation of cell protrusions , thereby promoting invasiveness and metastasis . 34 , 35 WAVE2 mRNA is one of the IGF2BP3‐ bound mRNAs in PDAC cells . 34 Thus , these reports suggest FIGURE 9 Signaling pathway molecules associated with WAVE2 and ACTN4 .

Pak1 is required for KIF5B‐mediated transport of a large WAVE2 protein complex toward membrane protrusions in response to hepatocyte growth factor in breast cancer cells . 11 , 36 Also , stathmin / Op18 is associated with hepatocyte growth factor‐ induced WAVE2 transport to membranes and the formation of cell protrusions . 37 The WAVE2‐Arp2 / 3 complex induces FIGURE 10 Effects of WAVE2 and ACTN4 on p27 activity .

The present study showed that WAVE2 co‐localized with ACTN4 in the cell protrusions of PDAC cells . ACTN4 is an actin‐binding protein that is abundantly localized in mem - brane protrusions , such as lamellipodia and filopodia , 39 but not in cell‐cell junctions . 13 The expression of ACTN4 in the cytoplasm is associated with worse survival after resection of PDAC and increased lymph node metastases in PDAC . 18 Knockdown of ACTN4 by siRNAs in PDAC cells reduces motility and invasiveness 17 and inhibits the formation of microvilli , 13 indicating that ACTN4 may play integral roles in protrusion formation , motility , and invasion of PDAC cells . In this study , subcellular localization of ACTN4 in PDAC cells with enhanced staining in cell protrusions indi - cated that WAVE2 functioned by associating with actin fila - ments via linking with ACTN4 in cell protrusions of PDAC cells . Similar to WAVE2 , knockdown of ACTN4 consistently suppressed the formation of cell protrusions driven by actin polymerization and inhibited the motility and invasion of PDAC cells . Our study showed that WAVE2 and ACTN4 co - operatively induced actin‐driven membrane protrusions and promoted the motility and invasiveness of PDAC cells .

Recently , the Rac1 / WAVE2 / Arp2 / 3 signaling pathway was reported to promote cell migration and invasion of gli - oma cells and liver cancer cells . 40 , 41 The WAVE2 / Annexin A2 / DOCK3 / β‐catenin signaling pathway promotes the inva - siveness and metastasis of liver cancer cells . 42 These findings indicated that WAVE2‐associated signaling pathways play important roles in cell invasion and metastasis in various types of cancer cells . The present study provides novel ev - idence that the WAVE2 / ACTN4 pathway may be associated with regulation of p27 activity and that this WAVE2 / ACTN4 / p27 pathway plays important roles in actin polymerization as well as cell motility and invasiveness . Low p27 is correlated with poor prognosis of PDAC . 43 Although nuclear p27 in - duces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis , p27 functions as an oncogene by promoting cell migration and metastasis when p27 is mislocalized to the cytoplasm . 44 , 45 Phosphorylated p27 immunoreactivity was observed predominantly in the cyto - plasm and was present in the nucleus of S2‐013 and PANC‐1 cells , whereas its expression in the nucleus of HPNE cells was lower than in PDAC cells ( Figure 10A ) . Cytoplasmic p27 associates with RhoA and interferes with GDP exchange from RhoA , leading to the formation of actin‐driven mem - brane protrusions that promote cell migration . 46 In addi - tion to regulation of RhoA activity , p27 phosphorylation is FIGURE 12 Association of WAVE2 with p27 in the regulation of the motility and invasiveness of PDAC cells .

In conclusion , WAVE2 promotes cell motility and inva - sion and may be a useful marker for poor prognosis of post - operative PDAC patients . Mechanistically , we provided the first evidence that WAVE2 mediates cell motility and in - vasion by modulating cytoplasmic p27 activity in PDAC cells through linking with ACTN4 . In addition , this study indicated that inhibition of ( a ) WAVE2 , ( b ) the binding of WAVE2 and ACTN4 , ( c ) the binding of ACTN4 and actin filaments , or ( d ) some combination thereof may be effec - tive for development of new therapeutic strategies , because any such therapy would inhibit WAVE2‐mediated cell mo - tility and invasion of PDAC cells .
