Introduction Among cell surface receptors , integrins undergo the most com - plex and longest - range conformational changes currently known . These changes function to transmit bidirectional signals over long distances between the ligand - binding integrin headpiece and the actin cytoskeleton . Integrins thus are able to communi - cate binding to the extracellular matrix or ligands on other cells to the actin cytoskeleton , to discriminate against soluble ligands , and to bind only with high affinity to cell surface or matrix - bound ligands ( Luo et al . , 2007 ; Springer and Dustin , 2012 ) . Integrins contain  and  subunits . The  subunit  - propeller and thigh domains and the  subunit  I , hybrid , PSI ( plexin , semaphorin , and integrin ) , and I - EGF - 1 domains form the ligand - binding headpiece , i . e . , the head and the upper legs ( Fig . 1 ) . The  subunit calf - 1 and calf - 2 and the  subunit I - EGF - 2 to I - EGF - 4 and  tail domains form the lower legs ( Fig . 1 ; Xiong et al . , 2001 ; Zhu et al . , 2008 ) . Two distinct types of global conformational changes occur in integrin extracellular domains . Extension at the knees releases integrins from a compact bent conformation ( Fig . 1 , A , B , D , and E ) . In integrin headpiece opening , the hybrid domain swings out , the  I domain changes from closed to open conformation , and affinity for ligand increases ( Fig . 1 , B , C , E , and F ; Takagi et al . , 2002 ; Luo et al . , 2007 ; Springer and Dustin , 2012 ) .  I domains , present in all integrin  subunits , transmit conformational change from their interface with the swinging hybrid domain to a ligand binding site at an interface with the  subunit  - propeller domain ( Fig . 1 , A – F ; Xiao et al . , 2004 ) . The  I domain divides the hybrid domain into N - and C - terminal sequence segments . Activation at the metal ion - dependent adhe - sion site ( MIDAS ) in the  I domain ligand binding site is com - municated to the opposite end of the  I domain by  7 helix pistoning at the C - terminal connection to the hybrid domain ( Fig . 1 , B , C , E , and F ) . Pivoting about the N - terminal connec - tion causes the hybrid domain to swing away from the  subunit thigh domain , with an increase in separation at the  and  knees of 70 Å ( Takagi et al . , 2002 ; Xiao et al . , 2004 ) . Swing out is readily visualized in solution by small angle x - ray scattering for both headpiece fragment ( Mould et al . , 2003b ) and intact , deter - gent - soluble integrin ( Eng et al . , 2011 ) and at typical negative - stain EM or tomography resolution of  25 Å for intact integrins or their ectodomain or headpiece fragments ( Takagi et al . , 2002 , 2003 ; Iwasaki et al . , 2005 ; Eng et al . , 2011 ; Shi et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2012 ; Yu et al . , 2012 ) . The evidence for integrin headpiece opening and its as - sociation with the high affinity state of integrins is extensive . C arefully soaking crystals with Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) peptides , we captured eight distinct RGD - bound conformations of the  IIb  3 integrin headpiece . Starting from the closed  I domain conformation , we saw six intermediate  I conformations and finally the fully open  I with the hybrid domain swung out in the crystal lattice . The  1 -  1 backbone that hydrogen bonds to the Asp side chain of RGD was the first element to move followed by adjacent to metal ion - dependent adhesion site Ca 2 + ,  1 helix ,  1’ helix ,  6 -  7 loop ,  7 helix , and hybrid domain . We define in atomic detail how conformational change was transmitted over long distances in integrins , 40 Å from the ligand binding site to the opposite end of the  I domain and 80 Å to the far end of the hybrid domain . During these movements , RGD slid in its binding groove toward  IIb , and its Arg side chain became ordered . RGD concentration requirements in soaking suggested a > 200 - fold higher affinity after opening . The thermo - dynamic cycle shows how higher affinity pays the ener - getic cost of opening .

T H E J O U R N A L O F C E L L B I O L O G Y JCB • VOLUME 201 • NUMBER 7 • 2013 1054 on  IIb  3 and  v  3 integrins . One idea , based on the observa - tion that more metal ion sites in the  I domain are occupied in  v  3 crystals after soaking with ligand than in absence of ligand , is that metal ion binding could somehow regulate ligand binding ( Xiong et al . , 2002 ) . However , protonation of metal - coordinating Asp and Glu residues at the low pH at which  v  3 crystallizes is probably responsible for variable absence of bound metal ( Dong et al . , 2012 ) , and unliganded , closed  IIb  3 , which crystallizes at higher pH , has all metal sites bound ( Zhu et al . , 2008 , 2010 ) . Arguments for regulation by a deadbolt and then an interface between the  and  knees have been raised ( Gupta et al . , 2007 ; Xiong et al . , 2009 ) and contradicted ( Zhu et al . , 2007a ; Smagghe et al . , 2010 ; Xie et al . , 2010 ; Dong et al . , 2012 ) . In contrast , mutational studies that shorten the  I  7 helix ( Yang et al . , 2004 ) or introduce disulfide bonds ( Luo et al . , 2004c ; Kamata et al . , 2010 ) , N - glycan wedges ( Luo et al . , 2003 , 2004b ) , or point mutations ( Mould et al . , 2003a ; Barton et al . , 2004 ; Luo et al . , 2009 ) consistently show that the closed and open headpiece conformations of intact  3 integrins on cell surfaces have low and high affinity for ligand , respectively . Soaking RGD peptides into closed , bent  V  3 ectodomain and  5  1 closed headpiece crystals has in each case revealed only a single intermediate and a conformation nearer to closed than open ( Xiong et al . , 2002 ; Nagae et al . , 2012 ) . Although the  I do - main adopted an intermediate conformation in these studies , little  1 helix movement occurred , the  7 helix did not piston , and the hybrid domain did not swing out ; thus , the headpiece remained in an overall closed conformation . If ligands added to crystals were able to drive conformational change all the way to the open head - piece , this would provide incontrovertible thermodynamic evi - dence that RGD peptides bind with higher affinity to the open than closed headpiece conformation . With purified integrins , conformational change is most readily studied by adding an excess of ligand ; however , because of the principle of reversibility of chemical reactions , the same pathway will mediate change in both the outside - in and inside - out directions . Because the difference is so large between the closed and open headpiece , structures trapped at various posi - tions along the pathway between these states would provide important information about how such a large conformational RGD opens the headpiece of  v  3 ectodomain ( Takagi et al . , 2002 ) . RGD and fibronectin open the  5  1 headpiece ( Mould et al . , 2003b ; Takagi et al . , 2003 ) , and an allosteric , inhibitory Fab lowers affinity for fibronectin by stabilizing the closed head - piece ( Luo et al . , 2004b ; Nagae et al . , 2012 ) . The  IIb  3 head - piece cocrystallizes with ligands and pseudoligands with an open headpiece ( Xiao et al . , 2004 ) and in their absence with a closed headpiece ( Zhu et al . , 2010 ) . RGD mimetics increase the Stokes radius of the  IIb  3 headpiece by the amount predicted from the hydrodynamic radii of the crystal structures of the closed and open headpieces ( Zhu et al . , 2010 ) . Headpiece opening induced by ligand mimetics has been demonstrated with detergent - soluble intact  IIb  3 using EM ( Eng et al . , 2011 ) , small angle x - ray scat - tering ( Eng et al . , 2011 ) , and electron tomography ( Iwasaki et al . , 2005 ) . Antibodies that stabilize the closed and open headpieces of  2 integrins show that the open conformation is required for cell adhesion and high affinity ( Chen et al . , 2010 ; Schürpf and Springer , 2011 ) . The equilibria between integrin extension and headpiece opening are linked because the hybrid domain , as part of the upper  leg , participates in interfaces with the lower legs that stabilize the bent conformation ( Fig . 1 ) . Thus , induction by li - gand of headpiece opening in intact integrins or ectodomain fragments is always accompanied by integrin extension . Fur - thermore , because the lower  and  legs are very close in the ectodomain , and the  and  subunit transmembrane ( TM ) do - mains associate with one another , the equilibria governing inte - grin TM domain association , extension , and headpiece opening are all linked ( Takagi et al . , 2002 ) . The complexities of linked equilibria , the lack of a clear order to the steps in integrin activation ( Takagi et al . , 2002 ) , and the complexity of the structure of the integrin ectodomain itself have all contributed to the difficulty of comprehending the structural basis of integrin function in the cell biology com - munity . Currently , the concept that the open integrin headpiece corresponds to the conformation with high affinity for ligand is well accepted for  1 ,  2 ,  6 , and  7 integrins , as referenced in the preceding paragraphs . However , this concept remains controversial in the  3 integrin field ( Adair et al . , 2005 ; Xiong et al . , 2009 ) and has resulted in a lively dialog in the literature Figure 1 . Integrin domain organization and conformational states . Two lower  leg conformations ( one with a dashed line ) are shown for the extended states because the lower  leg is highly flexible ( Takagi et al . , 2002 ) , and these states can exist with the  and  TM domains either associated or separated ( Zhu et al . , 2007b ) . However , signal transmission through the membrane , both in the inside - out and outside - in directions , requires TM and cytoplasmic domain separation ( Kim et al . , 2003 ; Luo et al . , 2004a ; Zhu et al . , 2007b ) . 1055 Eight snapshots of integrin headpiece opening • Zhu et al . out of the hybrid domain in one molecule in the asymmetric unit ( see Hybrid domain swing out in the crystal lattice in Results ) . An almost identical change in unit cell dimension occurred in a crystal soaked with 10 mM of a one - residue - longer GRGDSPK peptide in Mn / Ca , and it also showed hybrid domain swing out ; however , because resolution was lower at 2 . 75 Å and the C - terminal Lys residue of the GRGDSPK peptide was not re - solved , this crystal was not fully refined . Molecules 1 and 2 in the asymmetric unit in each of six crystals result in 12 examples of the  IIb  3 headpiece bound to GRGDSP peptide ( Table 1 ) . Comparisons among these , with a previously published native closed - headpiece structure ( Zhu et al . , 2012 ) and with an open - headpiece structure that was co - crystallized with a ligand mimetic ( Springer et al . , 2008 ) , define eight conformational states . States 1 and 8 correspond to closed and open , respectively , and states 2 – 7 correspond to intermedi - ate conformations ( Table 1 ) . Overall , there was a close correlation between soaking condition and conformational state ( Table 1 ) . The shift in con - formation in Mn / Ca was clearly dependent on RGD because no conformational change was observed in Mn / Ca alone ( Table 1 ; Fig . S1 , A and B ; and Fig . S2 , A and B ) . In Mn / Ca , the confor - mation of molecule 2 progressively shifted more toward open between 1 , 3 , 5 , and 10 mM RGD ( Table 1 ) . In contrast , the con - formation of molecule 1 shifted immediately to state 7 at 1 mM RGD in Mn / Ca and continued to be in state 7 in 3 and 5 mM RGD until it shifted to state 6 in 10 mM RGD , coincident with the change in lattice dimensions and the swing out of the hybrid domain in molecule 2 . Insights into ligand binding RGD binds at the interface between the  IIb  - propeller and  3  I domains ( Fig . 2 ) . The Arg and Asp side chains of RGD extend linearly in opposite directions toward  IIb and  3 , respectively ( Fig . 2 , B – J ) . A binding pocket is formed by aliphatic and aro - matic side chains , water - mediated interaction with the Arg back - bone carbonyl oxygen , and specific interactions with the Arg and Asp side chains . The Arg’s positively charged guanidino moiety forms a salt bridge and , in states 4 – 8 , also forms hydrogen bonds to the side chain of  IIb residue Asp - 224 ( Fig . 2 ) . One Asp carboxyl oxygen coordinates to the MIDAS metal ion , and depending on the conformation , the two Asp carboxyl oxygens hydrogen bond change is accomplished . In this study , we soaked RGD peptide into closed  IIb  3 headpiece crystals under different conditions . We captured RGD peptide bound to the closed headpiece , six intermediate states between closed and open , complete conver - sion of the  I domain to the open state , and swing out of the hy - brid domain in the crystal lattice . Results Soaking RGD peptide into closed headpiece crystals of  IIb  3 In the closed  IIb  3 headpiece crystal form studied here , two independent molecules are present in the asymmetric unit . Each molecule contains the  IIb subunit  - propeller domain bound to 10E5 Fab and the  3 subunit PSI , hybrid ,  I , and I - EGF - 1 domains ( Zhu et al . , 2010 ) . Crystals were soaked with or without GRGDSP peptide in buffer containing either 5 mM Mg 2 + / 1 mM Ca 2 + ( Mg / Ca ) or 2 mM Mn 2 + / 0 . 1 mM Ca 2 + ( Mn / Ca ; Table 1 ) . Crystals were stable after soaking for up to 24 h in 10 mM GRGDSP and Mg / Ca ; furthermore , diffraction revealed bound peptide . However , soaking with 0 . 34 mM peptide for 72 h did not show bound ligand . In contrast , strong electron density for ligand was observed after soaking a preformed open  IIb  3 head - piece crystal with 0 . 05 mM peptide ( Springer et al . , 2008 ) . Soaking in 10 mM GRGDSP and Mn / Ca for 4 h resulted in no visible cracks in some crystals and microscopically visible cracks in others . Some of these crystals yielded excellent diffrac - tion ( Table 1 ) . All crystals had cracks after 6 h , and some began to dissolve . At 12 h , all crystals dissolved . Soaking for 0 . 5 , 1 , 1 . 5 , and 2 h failed to yield similarly good diffraction , perhaps because conformational state was not homogenous in the crystal . There - fore , in Mn / Ca , we chose 4 h as an optimum time point and varied the concentration of RGD peptide from 1 to 10 mM ( Table 1 ) . Diffraction data from a large number of soaked crystals were examined . A single round of refinement was sufficient to show whether electron density at the ligand binding site corresponding to bound peptide was present . The best diffracting crystals from six soaking conditions were fully refined from 2 . 35 - to 3 . 00 - Å resolution with R free  0 . 22 ( Table 2 ) . All crystals were isomorphous with starting crystals , except for crystals soaked with 10 mM GRGDSP in Mn / Ca . These crys - tals shrank 26 Å along the a axis ( Table 2 ) , correlating with swing Table 1 .

JCB • VOLUME 201 • NUMBER 7 • 2013 1056 Arg side chain conformations were evident in molecules 1 and 2 after soaking with 10 mM peptide for 24 h in Mg / Ca ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . Electron density for Arg was markedly weaker in mol - ecule 2 , and a single side chain conformation was modeled , after soaking with 1 , 3 , and 5 mM peptide for 4 h in Mn / Ca ( Fig . 2 , D – F ) . Molecule 1 has greater accessibility of its ligand bind - ing pocket in the crystal lattice than molecule 2 , and more com - pletely bound ligand when soaking was limited to 4 h ( Fig . 3 ) . Strong electron densities were present for the metals at the three  I domain metal ion binding sites . When Mn 2 + was pres - ent , it largely replaced the Mg 2 + at the MIDAS and the Ca 2 + at the synergistic metal binding site ( SyMBS ) and adjacent to MIDAS ( ADMIDAS ) ; electron density was fit best when metals at all three sites were modeled as Mn 2 + ( Fig . 2 , D – I ; and Fig . S1 ) . In crystals soaked with Mn / Ca alone , the RGD - binding pockets of both molecule 1 and 2 were occupied with solvent molecules , which often occupied the same positions as polar atoms of the ligand ( Fig . S1 , A and B ) . Remarkably , the structures reveal movements in position of the bound RGD . One of the most important movements dur - ing opening is the strengthening of hydrogen bonds between the RGD Asp side chain and the  I  1 -  1 loop backbone as the distance between these elements decreases ( Fig . 2 and Fig . 4 ) . to one to three backbone nitrogens of  I domain residues Tyr - 122 and Ser - 123 in the  1 -  1 loop and Arg - 214 ( Fig . 2 , B – J ) . Electron density for the ligand in general correlated with the ligand concentration used in soaking and the amount of con - formational change ( Fig . 3 ) . The real space correlation coeffi - cient ( RSCC ) of electron density for Arg , Gly , and Asp residues in RGD is an estimate of occupancy and order of the ligand at the ligand binding site . The overall trend in increase of RSCC for each of Arg , Gly , and Asp in molecule 2 after soaking for 4 h in Mn / Ca with 1 , 3 , 5 , and 10 mM RGD ( states 3 , 4 , 5 , and 8 ) shows that occupancy by RGD increases over this concentration range ( Fig . 3 ) . For comparison , we show RSCC for open  IIb  3 headpiece crystals formed with cacodylate ion bound to the  I MIDAS ; the cacodylate was replaced by soaking with 0 . 05 mM RGD peptide for 96 h in Mg / Ca ( Fig . 3 , state 8 ) . The RSCC values for Asp and Gly of the latter are similar to those for molecule 1 in state 6 and molecule 2 in state 8 , which suggests that satura - tion with RGD is nearly complete after soaking with 10 mM RGD for 4 h in Mn / Ca ( Fig . 3 ) . Among the residues of the ligand , the order of RSCC is Arg < Gly < Asp for all molecules ( Fig . 3 ) . This is consistent with Asp as the primary driver of RGD binding and disorder or multiple conformations of the Arg side chain . Two alternative Table 2 .

The key transitions in each step are described as follows . The structure in state 1 of molecule 2 in 10 mM RGD in Mg / Ca ( Fig . 2 B ) is remarkable because despite strong density for bound RGD , there is no significant difference from the closed conformation in absence of RGD ( Fig . 5 A ) . One RGD Asp carboxyl oxygen directly coordinates the MIDAS Mg 2 + ( Fig . 2 B ) by replacing a water molecule ( Fig . 2 A ) , whereas the other Asp carboxyl oxygen hydrogen bonds to the back - bone nitrogen of Tyr - 122 ( Fig . 2 B and Fig . 6 A , image 1 ) . However , the Asp side chain orients differently than in all other states ( Fig . 6 A ) . In state 2 , the RGD Asp side chain rotates to the same orientation as in states 3 – 8 ( Fig . 6 A , image 2 ) . Furthermore , the  I domain  1 -  1 loop moves 0 . 5 Å toward the Asp of RGD . In state 3 , the  1 -  1 loop moves still closer to the Asp of RGD ( Fig . 6 A , image 3 ) . The closer approach of the  1 -  1 back - bone nitrogens , together with the rotation of the Asp side chain in preceding state 2 , enables formation of a second backbone hydro - gen bond to the RGD Asp ( Fig . 6 A , image 3 ) . These two hydrogen bonds , between each of the two Asp oxygens and the Tyr - 122 and Ser - 123 backbone NH groups , remain intact in all subsequent states and grow in strength with closer approach of the  1 -  1 However , both elements also move together toward the  subunit , with the Asp side chain and  1 -  1 loop moving 1 . 3 and 2 . 2 Å , respectively ( Fig . 4 ) . Thus , during the opening process , the entire RGD backbone slides in its groove closer to Asp - 224 in the  - propeller domain ( Fig . 2 ) . The Arg side chain forms strong hydrogen bonds to  IIb Asp - 224 only in the final stages of RGD backbone sliding . In states 1 – 3 , the distances are too great for hydrogen bonds , and intervening water molecules are explic - itly visible in states 1 and 2 in which RGD density is strong ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . Arg density is weak in states 3 – 5 ( Fig . 2 , D – F ) , and two Arg conformations are present in state 6 ( Fig . 2 G ) . It is only by state 7 that two strong hydrogen bonds develop be - tween the RGD Arg and  IIb Asp - 224 side chains ( Fig . 2 H and Fig . S1 , C and D ) . The pathway of RGD - induced headpiece opening Our eight states reveal a detailed pathway for headpiece open - ing ( Fig . 5 and Fig . 6 ) . Movements occur only in the  subunit . From state 1 to 8 , the Ser - 123 backbone in the  1 -  1 loop moves 2 . 2 Å , the ADMIDAS metal ion moves 3 . 9 Å , and the carbonyl oxygen of Met - 335 moves 9 . 0 Å ( Fig . 4 ) . Fig . 5 shows a view of each state ( Fig . 5 , S1 – S8 ) that includes the ligand Asp and the moving portions of the  I domain .

The  1 helix moves in position more between states 5 and 6 than between previ - ous states ( Fig . 5 , A – F ) , accompanied by changes in positions of ADMIDAS - coordinating  1 helix side chains Asp - 126 and Asp - 127 ( Fig . 6 A , image 6 ) . However , the ADMIDAS metal ion moves further than these side chains , and direct ADMIDAS metal ion coordinations are lost to Asp - 126 and Asp - 127 . In their place , two water molecules appear that mediate indirect ADMIDAS metal ion coordinations to Asp - 126 and Asp - 127 ( Fig . 6 A , image 6 ) . The  6 -  7 loop reverses its movement to - ward the ADMIDAS metal ion seen in state 3 and moves away from the metal ion , making way for the  1 helix to move toward the ADMIDAS ( Fig . 6 A , image 6 ) . The three examples of state 7 each show a single RGD Arg side chain conformation ( Fig . 2 H and Fig . S1 , C and D ) and es - sentially identical  I domain conformations ( Fig . 5 G and Fig . S2 , C and D ) . In state 7 , the epicenter of conformational change shifts to the  1 helix and the  6 -  7 loop ( Fig . 6 B , image 2 ) . The  1 helix with its Asp - 126 and Asp - 127 residues moves almost as a rigid body toward the ADMIDAS metal ion , enabling direct co - ordinations of each Asp side chain to reform with the ADMIDAS metal ion . Additionally , Trp - 129 in the  1 helix changes rotamer and invades the space of the  6 -  7 loop even more than the  1 helix backbone ( Fig . 6 B , image 2 ) . These invasions completely displace the  6 -  7 loop , which flips far away to make way for the  1 helix ( Fig . 6 B , image 2 ) . In state 8 , the action shifts to the  1  and  7 helices . Be - tween states 7 and 8 , the  1  helix moves as a rigid body toward the  1 helix , with large movements of its buried , hydrophobic Leu - 134 and Leu - 138 side chains ( Fig . 6 B , image 3 ) . The loop between the  1 and  1  helices becomes helical , and the  1 and  1  helices with a bend between their axes merge into a single  1 helix with a single helical axis . Trp - 129 , near the merger , changes rotamer for the final time ( Fig . 6 B , image 3 ) . To make way for the merger of the  1 and  1  helices , the  6 -  7 loop backbone to the Asp side chain carboxyl oxygens . The approach of the Ser - 123 backbone to the Asp side chain is accompanied by approach of the Ser - 123 side chain oxygen to the MIDAS metal ion . These two atoms form a direct coordination for the first time in state 3 ( Fig . 6 A , image 3 ) , which is maintained in all sub - sequent states . The Ser - 123 side chain takes the position of a water , which in states 1 and 2 intervenes between the MIDAS metal ion and the Ser - 123 side chain ( Fig . 6 A , images 1 and 2 ) . To follow the movement of the  1 -  1 backbone , the ADMIDAS metal ion shifts 0 . 6 Å to maintain coordination to the Ser - 123 carbonyl oxygen ( Fig . 6 A , image 3 ) . Furthermore , the  6 -  7 loop moves with the ADMIDAS metal to maintain close coordination with the Met - 335 carbonyl oxygen ( Fig . 6 A , image 3 ) . In state 4 , the  1 -  1 loop and the ADMIDAS metal ion continue to approach the RGD Asp and MIDAS metal ion ( Fig . 6 A , image 4 ) . The RGD Asp side chain also moves , allow - ing RGD backbone sliding toward  IIb . The  1 helix is divided by a nonhelical segment into  1 and  1  helices ( Fig . 5 ) . In state 4 , the  1 portion begins to follow the movements of the  1 -  1 loop and the ADMIDAS metal ion ( Fig . 5 D and Fig . 6 A , image 4 ) . The ADMIDAS metal ion continues to follow the movement of Ser - 123 carbonyl oxygen and shifts an additional 1 . 0 Å , and ADMIDAS - coordinating residues in the  1 helix , Asp - 126 and Asp - 127 , begin to follow the movement of the ADMIDAS metal ion ( Fig . 6 A , image 4 ) . State 5 marks further movements of the ADMIDAS metal ion and a change in its coordination status . This metal ion now loses its coordination to the  6 -  7 loop backbone ; however , the  6 -  7 loop maintains the position adopted since state 3 ( Fig . 6 A , image 5 ) . Furthermore , the ADMIDAS gains a direct coordination to the side chain of Asp - 251 ( Fig . 6 A , image 5 ) . This direct coordination remains all the way to open state 8 and replaces an indirect coordination through a water molecule to Asp - 251 in states 1 – 4 ( Fig . 6 A ) . State 6 marks the completion of the movements of the  1 -  1 loop and ADMIDAS metal ion , which bring them into Figure 4 .

Fabs have no car - bohydrate and minimal flexibility compared with integrins and can stabilize crystal lattices and improve resolution . 10E5 Fab binds to the  - propeller domain , far from shape - shifting por - tions of the  subunit , and has no influence on  - propeller or integrin conformation as shown by comparisons among these many views of the  IIb  3 structure . Conformational changes have previously been visualized by soaking RGD into crystals containing the  V  3 ectodomain ( Xiong et al . , 2002 ) or  5  1 headpiece ( Nagae et al . , 2012 ) with closed conformations . The previous RGD /  V  3 structure in Mn 2 + is closest to our state 5 . The RGD /  5  1 structure in Mg / Ca is closest to our states 3 and 4 . These structures showed one intermediate trapped at a particular point in the shape - shifting pathway , in contrast to the eight RGD - bound states in a confor - mational continuum studied here . Although the term hinge opening was used in molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations of  V  3 ( Puklin - Faucher et al . , 2006 ; Puklin - Faucher and Vogel , 2009 ) , the simulations did not result in the open  I domain or open headpiece conformations seen here or previously ( Xiao et al . , 2004 ) . Compared with a 62° increase in angle between  I and hybrid domains in the open headpiece crystal structure , MD showed a 23° increase starting with a model of Fn3 domain 10 bound to a RGD - liganded state 5 – like structure and a 13° increase starting with an unliganded state 1 structure lacking metal ions at the MIDAS and SyMBS . The  1 and  1  helices merged and approached the  7 helix ; however , merger occurred in the absence of  7 helix pistoning and displacement of  6 -  7 loop residue Val - 340 from its ratchet pocket and occupation of this pocket by Leu - 134 in the  1 /  1  helix . Because the simula - tions began with state 5 , they were silent on RGD sliding and  1 -  1 loop movement , which are largely complete by states 5 – 6 . Dependence on RGD was not demonstrated by omitting RGD from the state 5 – like structure . RGD was not sufficient for  1 and  1  helix merger because it required a modeled interaction between the body of Fn3 domain 10 and the Trp - 129 side chain in the  1 helix itself . Large changes in position and rotamer of Trp - 129 between our states 4 , 6 , 7 , and 8 ( Fig . 6 B ) are incompatible with maintenance of a side chain hydrogen bond to the Fn3 domain 10 in the MD simulations . MD simulations of integrins are chal - lenging because the force fields lack descriptions of the highly directional nature of octahedral metal coordination and hydrogen bonds . MD lost physiological coordinations at the MIDAS and SyMBS ( Craig et al . , 2004 ) and an invariant water at the MIDAS ( Puklin - Faucher et al . , 2006 ) . Additionally , the  V  3 structures used in simulations lacked cis - Pro at  I domain residues 163 and 169 and contained a sequence - to - structure frameshift at specificity - determining loop residues 168 – 176 ( Dong et al . , 2012 ) that lie near the Fn3 docking site and  1 helix and could have affected MD results . Surprisingly ,  I domain reshaping is related to a change in position of RGD in the ligand - binding pocket . Movement of the  1 -  1 loop toward the Asp of RGD permitted the entire RGD moiety to slide in its groove away from the  3 subunit and toward the  IIb subunit . Sliding enabled a water - mediated interaction between the RGD Arg side chain and  IIb Asp - 224 to be converted the fully open state seen after cocrystallization with a ligand mimetic in Mg / Ca ( Fig . 6 B , image 4 ) . Even details of loop positions and rotamers of key side chains are identical . Opening is complete . Hybrid domain swing out in the crystal lattice  I domain  7 helix pistoning is accommodated by swing out of the hybrid domain . Fig . 7 ( A – C ) shows the environments in the crystal lattice , with one integrin molecule shown as a C  trace with each domain in a different color . Fab fragments and neighboring integrin molecules in the crystal lattice are shown as white , semitransparent , solvent - accessible surfaces . The native crystal lattice has room for the hybrid domain of molecule 2 to move to the right in the orientation shown in Fig . 7 A . In con - trast , similar movement of molecule 1 is prevented by its lat - tice ( Fig . 7 B ) . Indeed , soaking with 10 mM RGD in Mn / Ca for 4 h induced swing out of the hybrid domain of molecule 2 ( Fig . 7 C ) but not molecule 1 ( Fig . 7 B ) . The change in position of the hybrid domain after swing out is emphasized by placing the label “hybrid” in identical positions in Fig . 7 ( A – D ) . Although the dominant position of the hybrid domain in the lattice was clearly evident from simulated - annealing composite omit map ( mesh ; Fig . 7 C ) , this density was weaker than for the hybrid domain of molecule 1 , showing some variation in the position in the crystal lattice of the swung out hybrid domain in molecule 2 . Density for the PSI and I - EGF - 1 domains was insufficient to in - clude them in the molecular model . Enough space is present in the lattice to place the PSI and I - EGF - 1 domains based on the position of hybrid domain , as shown by models of the PSI and I - EGF - 1 in Fig . 7 C . Further , outward swing of the hybrid , PSI , and I - EGF - 1 domains appears to be constrained by the crystal lattice ( Fig . 7 C ) . Fig . 7 E compares the positions of the hybrid domain ob - tained in previous closed ( Fig . 7 E , blue ) and open ( Fig . 7 E , green ) crystal structures with that attained here by soaking ( Fig . 7 E , red ) . Binding of RGD has clearly induced swinging of the hy - brid domain toward its position in open crystal structures . How - ever , further movement to the same open position as seen when the headpiece is cocrystallized with ligand results in severe clashes with the lattice . This is illustrated by superposition of the open conformation seen in cocrystallization into the lattice , which shows that much of the ribbon trace of the hybrid domain is obscured by the semitransparent surface of the lattice ( Fig . 7 D ) . Clashes would be even more severe for the other molecule in the lattice ( Fig . 7 B ) were its hybrid domain to swing out , consistent with cracking and dissolution of crystals soaked for 6 and 12 h . Discussion Previous crystal structures of integrin  IIb  3 defined two con - formational states of its headpiece , closed and open . The same closed headpiece conformation was seen in crystals of the com - plete  IIb  3 ectodomain without Fab ( Zhu et al . , 2008 ) and in crystals of the  IIb  3 headpiece complex with 10E5 Fab identical to those studied here ( Zhu et al . , 2010 ) . Similarly , the same open conformation of the  IIb  3 headpiece was seen with a cacodylate JCB • VOLUME 201 • NUMBER 7 • 2013 1064 in Fig . 6 B ( image 1 ) . In state 7 , it adopts a very different buried rotamer and acts as a placeholder for the  1  helix . Then , in state 8 , Trp - 129 moves outward again and adopts yet another rotamer to make way for the merge of the  1 and  1  helices and the side chain of Leu - 134 . These movements illustrate the separability yet interde - pendence of the MIDAS and ADMIDAS coordination shells , the  1 -  1 loop ,  1 helix ,  1  helix , and  6 -  7 loop . The final movements of the  1  helix and  7 helix are highly concerted ( Video 3 ) . Compared with the earlier movements in states 1 – 6 , those of the  1 helix and  6 -  7 loop in state 7 are much larger , whereas the movements in the  1  helix ,  6 -  7 loop , and  7 helix in state 8 are cataclysmic . The extraordinary movements that follow state 7 likely correspond to a large decrease in free energy and suggest that state 7 must be close to the transition state for conformational change . Among the caveats in our study is the difficulty of model - ing the segments undergoing conformational change as single conformations . Particularly for the  6 -  7 loop in state 7 , density is consistent with multiple backbone conformations . Resolution of most of our structures was sufficient to model alternative conformations of the side chains of some residues ; however , attempts to include alternative backbone conformations did not improve model fit to density . In general , the quality of the den - sity in our structures is high . It is difficult to explain the gradual shift in positions described here in each structure as an averag - ing of structural ensembles that change in occupancy and not in position . Further evidence against this idea is the saltatory nature of many of the movements . Another caveat is that the states seen here are trapped in crystals and may be perturbed by lattice contacts . However , changes occurred in two molecules in different lattice environ - ments . Furthermore , despite presence of states 2 , 6 , and 7 in mol - ecule 1 and states 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 8 in molecule 2 , these states fall on a single pathway of headpiece opening . Constraints limiting conformational change differ in crystals and on cell surfaces . Nonetheless , hybrid domain swing out is the largest motion in headpiece opening and thus may be rate limiting for conforma - tional change on cell surfaces as well as in crystals . Furthermore , the different moving elements , i . e . ,  1 helix ,  1  helix ,  6 -  7 loop ,  7 helix , and hybrid domain are key on cell surfaces as well , as shown by mutational studies in these elements ( Luo et al . , 2003 , 2004b , c , 2009 ; Mould et al . , 2003a ; Barton et al . , 2004 ; Yang et al . , 2004 ; Kamata et al . , 2010 ) . It is extremely difficult to obtain information on confor - mational change on cell surfaces at any similar resolution , and structures determined here will likely offer the best models for understanding integrin allostery on cell surfaces for many years . The principle of the reversibility of chemical reactions implies that inside - out activation of integrins may proceed by a similar pathway as outside - in activation studied here but in the opposite direction . Two alternative mechanisms for achieving conformational change in proteins , selection by ligand of preexisting confor - mational states and ligand - induced fit ( Henzler - Wildman and Kern , 2007 ) , are linked in a thermodynamic cycle ( Fig . 8 ) . In the crystals studied here , no conformational change is required to a much stronger direct , charged interaction through multiple hy - drogen bonds . Sliding also correlated with a shift from multiple Arg side chain conformations to a single conformation . Sliding and disorder or multiple conformations of the Arg side chain show that binding of the Asp of RGD to the MIDAS metal ion and the  1 -  1 loop backbone is energetically more important than Arg interactions with the  IIb subunit . Placing our structural snapshots into sequence in a movie provides a plausible shape - shifting pathway for conformational change in integrins ( Videos 1 , 2 , and 3 ) . In contrast to previous soaking studies , our state 1 structure shows that RGD can bind to  IIb  3 with no appreciable change in structure . The early parts of the pathway from state 1 to 6 are captured in atomic detail as movements of < 1 Å , whereas those in states 7 and 8 involve large concerted changes . Ligand - induced integrin shape shifting begins in the  1 -  1 loop and then works its way more C - terminally in the  1 and  1  helices until they finally merge and push the  6 -  7 loop and  7 helix out of the way toward the hybrid domain . Linkage between the MIDAS and ADMIDAS coordination shells grows between states 3 and 6 ( Video 2 ) . In state 3 , the Ser - 123 side chain replaces a water molecule in the inner MIDAS coordination sphere ; the Ser - 123 backbone oxygen directly coordinates the ADMIDAS through states 1 – 8 . In state 5 , the ADMIDAS metal ion directly coordinates the Asp - 251 side chain . In state 6 , the same Asp - 251 oxygen indirectly coordinates the MIDAS through the Ser - 123 side chain ; the other Asp - 251 oxy - gen indirectly coordinates the MIDAS through a water molecule throughout states 1 – 8 ( Fig . 6 ) . By state 6 , interaction between the MIDAS and ADMIDAS coordination shells is strong enough to leave behind the direct ADMIDAS coordinations to the Asp - 126 and Asp - 127 side chains , which are reformed in state 7 . Saltatory motions between states 1 and 7 thus include nu - merous steps of removal , addition , and removal yet again of wa - ters that provide indirect MIDAS and ADMIDAS coordinations to side chains . Another movement not predicted by structural in - terpolation is that of the  6 -  7 loop . Its coordinating Met - 335 carbonyl oxygen moves toward the fleeing ADMIDAS in state 3 and stays in this new position until state 6 , when it moves in the opposite direction . Presumably , the movement of the  1 -  1 loop places strain on the  1 helix , which contains ADMIDAS - coordinating resi - dues Asp - 126 and Asp - 127 . In state 7 , there is a large rigid - body movement of the  1 helix , as Asp - 126 and Asp - 127 catch up with and reform direct coordinations to the ADMIDAS . In turn , the movement of the  1 helix is likely to place strain on the  1  helix . In final state 8 , the  1  helix catches up with and joins to the  1 helix . Alignment of the  1 and  1  helices squeezes at their junction the  6 -  7 loop . The hydrophobic ratchet pocket occupied by  6 -  7 residue Val - 340 in states 1 – 6 is occupied by  1 helix residue Leu - 134 in state 8 , with Val - 340 in an inter - mediate position in state 7 ( Fig . 6 ) . Merging of the  1 and  1  helices appears to be the final straw that breaks the camel’s back and pushes the  7 helix toward the hybrid domain , causing it to swing out . The side chain of Trp - 129 near the end of the  1 helix appears to buffer the large  1 and  1  conformational movements between states 6 and 8 . Between states 1 and 6 , the Trp - 129 side chain can occupy either of the two rotamers shown 1065 Eight snapshots of integrin headpiece opening • Zhu et al . closed headpiece for RGD . This affinity is between 0 . 34 and 10 mM and closer to 10 mM . It is not possible to estimate the affinity of the closed headpiece for RGD from measurements of binding to integrins in solution or on cell surfaces because , as discussed in the previous two paragraphs , the higher affinity for the open headpiece is more than sufficient to pay the energetic penalty of inducing or selecting the open headpiece conforma - tion . Conversion to the open headpiece is consistent with 50 % effective concentration estimates in the range of 7 µM to 1 mM RGD in Mg / Ca for binding of antibodies to ligand - induced binding sites or increased protease sensitivity using isolated , intact  IIb  3 or  IIb  3 and  V  3 on cell surfaces ( Parise et al . , 1987 ; Frelinger et al . , 1988 , 1990 ) . 50 % inhibitory concentra - tion values for inhibition by RGD of activated platelet binding to ligands are in the range of 0 . 01 – 0 . 2 mM ( Plow et al . , 1985 ) , suggesting that the headpiece has been opened . The thermodynamic cycle characterized here for headpiece fragments has wide applicability . In extended integrins ( Fig . 1 , B , C , E , and F ) , as in headpiece fragments , none of the headpiece domains are in buried interfaces , and the lower  leg is highly flexible ( Fig . 1 , dashed lines ) . Therefore , the relative energies of the four states in the cycle ( Fig . 8 ) are expected to be very similar in headpiece fragments and in extended integrins on cell sur - faces . Bent integrins on cell surfaces have extensive interfaces that are exposed upon extension ; the hybrid domain is in one of these buried interfaces ( Fig . 1 , A and D ) . Also , the  and  sub - unit C termini are close to one another in the bent conformation , and the TM domains associate ( Luo et al . , 2007 ; Springer and Dustin , 2012 ) . Because headpiece opening exposes most of the same interfaces that become exposed upon integrin extension ,  G induced fit and  G conf in Fig . 8 ( which each require headpiece opening ) are higher ( by similar amounts ) for cell surface integ - rins than for headpiece fragments . If one is willing to accept that ligand - induced binding site epitopes in  3 integrins measure ei - ther integrin extension induced by headpiece opening or head - piece opening itself , one could conclude that  G induced fit is negative and  G conf is positive ( as for integrin headpieces ) and deduce that the open headpiece conformation has higher affinity for RGD than the closed headpiece conformation in intact integrins , just as demonstrated here for headpiece fragments . A remaining question is whether headpiece opening upon ligand binding is general for integrins or is dependent on the in - tegrin or the ligand . MAdCAM - 1 binding to the  4  7 headpiece for RGD binding to state 1 , and thus , induced fit ( Fig . 8 , k 1 and k 2 ) is the mechanism driving conformational change . However , on cell surfaces , interconversion between conformational states driven by thermal motion ( Fig . 8 , k 3 and k  3 ) will be far faster than in crystals , and inside - out signals may also increase k 3 . Therefore , the relative fluxes of integrins to ligand - bound states on cell surfaces through induced fit ( k 1 and k 2 ) , and selection of preexisting states ( k 3 and k 4 ) will depend on their relative rates , as well as ligand concentration , and remains to be determined . RGD must bind with higher affinity to the open than closed headpiece to drive conversion to the higher energy open headpiece conformation . This may be formally demonstrated using the thermodynamic cycle ( Fig . 8 ) . The difference in en - ergy between any two states in this cycle is identical , whether conversion occurs by clockwise or counterclockwise routes . Therefore ,  G open + RGD =  G closed + RGD +  G induced fit   G conf . Crystal soaking experiments demonstrate that  G induced fit is highly negative . A large number of experiments referenced in the Introduction demonstrate that in absence of ligand , [ Closed ] > > [ Open ] ; therefore ,  G conf is highly positive . It follows from the aforementioned equation that  G open + RGD < <  G closed + RGD ; i . e . , that the affinity of the open headpiece is much higher than that of the closed headpiece for RGD . Conclusions based on soaking experiments in Mn / Ca and the thermodynamic cycle are supported by soaking results in Mg / Ca ( Fig . 3 ) . Based on soaking with 10 mM RGD in Mn / Ca for differ - ent times , near - equilibrium concentrations of RGD should have been reached inside the crystal lattice after soaking with 10 mM RGD in Mg / Ca for 24 h . Incomplete occupation of the ligand bind - ing site in Mg / Ca as shown by the RSCC values in Fig . 3 suggests an affinity insufficient to saturate binding in 10 mM RGD , consis - tent with lack of detectable binding after soaking for 72 h with 0 . 34 mM RGD in Mg / Ca . In contrast , when crystals with the open headpiece were soaked for 96 h with 0 . 05 mM RGD in Mg / Ca , RGD peptide completely replaced a cacodylate pseudo - ligand ( Fig . 3 ; Springer et al . , 2008 ) . Complete saturation of the open headpiece at 0 . 05 mM RGD and incomplete saturation of the closed headpiece at 10 mM RGD support the conclusion that the affinity of the open  IIb  3 headpiece for RGD peptide is ≥200 - fold higher than that of the closed headpiece in Mg / Ca . The ability of the lattice around molecule 2 to hold the in - tegrin headpiece in the closed conformation after binding RGD in Mg / Ca provides a thus far unique estimate of affinity of the Figure 8 . The thermodynamic cycle for ligand binding and conformational change in integrins . The  G values are for reactions in the direction shown by the arrows . From the unliganded closed state in the bottom left , the induced - fit mechanism proceeds clockwise , and the preexisting confor - mational change mechanism with selection by ligand pro - ceeds counterclockwise , to the liganded open state in the top right . The cycle for headpiece fragments can be modified for intact integrins on cell surfaces by adding additional confor - mational states such as those shown in Fig . 1 . JCB • VOLUME 201 • NUMBER 7 • 2013 1066 coil and His6 tag , and further purified exactly as described in detail in the supplemental materials in Xiao et al . ( 2004 ) . Crystallization in complex with 10E5 Fab in the absence of ligand was as previously described ( Zhu et al . , 2010 ) ; purified  IIb  3 – 10E5 - Fab complex at 10 mg / ml was crystal - lized at 4°C in hanging drops by adding an equal volume of 11 – 13 % PEG 8000 , 0 . 2 M ammonium sulfate , and 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 9 . Crystals did not always appear under these conditions . In this case , crystal seed - ing was used . Seeds were obtained by breaking a single crystal with a seed bead ( Hampton Research ) . 0 . 1 - µl diluted crystal seeds were added to 0 . 9 µl of a hanging drop that had preequilibrated overnight . Crystals were grown at 4°C for > 1 mo before soaking . Crystal soaking and diffraction data collection Crystals were harvested in cryosolution containing 15 % PEG 8000 , 0 . 2 M ammonium sulfate , and 0 . 1 M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 9 , with the addition of glycerol as a cryoprotectant in 5 % increments up to a 20 % final concentration . Har - vested crystals were soaked in the same cryosolution plus desired concentra - tions of GRGDSP peptide and metal ions shown in Table 1 for the indicated times at 4°C before plunge vitrification in liquid nitrogen . Diffraction data were collected at beamline 23 - ID ( Advanced Photon Source ) and processed with MOSFLM ( Leslie and Powell , 2007 ) and SCALA ( Evans , 2006 ) or the XDS package ( Kabsch , 2001 ) . Resolution cutoff was chosen to give I /  ( I ) > 1 . 6 in the highest resolution shell . Structure refinement For soaked crystals with little difference in the unit cell compared with the nonsoaked crystal , we used the closed - headpiece  IIb  3 – 10E5 - Fab structure ( Protein Data Bank accession no . 3NIG ; 2 . 25 Å ) as the starting structure and subjected each domain to rigid body refinement with PHENIX ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) . Electron densities at the ligand binding pocket corresponding to RGD peptides were readily identified after the first round of rigid body refinement . For crystals soaked with 10 mM RGD peptide in Mn 2 + , the unit cell shrank in a dimension , and structures were solved by molecular replacement with PHASER ( McCoy et al . , 2007 ) using the  IIb  - propeller and  3  I domains as search models . Structures of soaked ligands were built into their electron densities with COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan , 2004 ) . The complete structures were then finalized by several rounds of rebuilding with COOT and refinement with PHENIX ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) . High resolution  IIb  3 structures ( 3T3P , 2 . 2 Å ; or 3NIG , 2 . 25 Å ) were used as reference structures when rebuilding the lower resolution soaked structures with COOT . Metal ion coordination restraints were used for MIDAS and SyMBS , but not ADMIDAS metals , during refine - ment with PHENIX . Because the two molecules of the asymmetric unit were trapped in different conformations after crystal soaking , noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were not used during structure refinement . The structures were validated with the MolProbity server ( Davis et al . , 2007 ) . Simulated - annealing composite omit maps and RSCCs Both simulated - annealing composite omit maps and RSCCs with simulated - annealing composite omit density were calculated by PHENIX ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) . When dual conformations were present , the structures were refined with either conformation or a third intermediate conformation as a single conformation , and the highest RSCC values were plotted . Although RSCC values provide a good estimate of occupancy , they also are depen - dent on the resolution and quality of the diffraction data and refinement . Superpositions and figures All superpositions were on C  atoms of the  IIb  - propeller domain and nonmoving portions of the  3  I domain . Panels in multipanel figures ( Fig . 2 , Fig . 4 , Fig . 6 [ A and B ] , and Fig . 7 [ A – D ] ) are shown in identical orientations and are aligned vertically and horizontally on the page . Fig - ures were prepared with PyMOL ( Schrödinger , LLC ) . All main text figures use the states indicated in Table 1 . Online supplemental material Fig .

This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grant HL - 103526 . Jieqing Zhu is a recipient of a Scientist Development Grant from can yield either an intermediate or open state as seen by EM ( Yu et al . , 2012 ) , which appear to mediate rolling adhesion ( inter - mediate affinity ) and firm adhesion ( high affinity ) , respectively ( Chen et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , there may be differences among inte - grins . However , headpiece opening has been demonstrated for all integrins yet tested , including those containing the  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  6 , and  7 subunits ( Shi et al . , 2011 ; Springer and Dustin , 2012 ; Yu et al . , 2012 ) . An obvious exception would be when a carboxyl group is absent in the ligand because this is the moi - ety that interacts with the integrin  subunit in which allostery occurs . Thus , antagonists that mimic the Arg moiety of RGD and do not bind the MIDAS , or instead displace Mg 2 + from the MIDAS , do not activate opening and stabilize the closed head - piece against opening , respectively ( Zhu et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) . Is binding to the MIDAS alone sufficient to open the head - piece , or must another moiety such as the Arg of RGD pull the  I domain  1 -  1 loop toward the  subunit to open the head - piece ? The primary role of the Asp shown here in allostery sug - gests that Arg might not be required . Some small molecules based on RGD , selected by the pharmaceutical industry for their ability to bind equally well to the low and high affinity states of  IIb  3 , are reported not to induce reactivity with antibodies to ligand - induced binding sites ( Aga et al . , 2004 ) and , therefore , appear not to induce headpiece opening . These mimetics have unique chemical features that may set them apart from the Asp and Glu side chains present in physiological integrin ligands . Further investigation is important of the principles that li - gand binding induces integrin headpiece opening and that the open headpiece corresponds to the high affinity state of integrins . The large movement at the integrin knees upon headpiece open - ing is thought to be important for transmission of allostery through long legs that are flexible except when elongational force is applied in cell adhesion ( Zhu et al . , 2008 ; Springer and Dustin , 2012 ) . We have shown here a remarkable pathway for transmis - sion of signals in a cell surface protein with an exceptionally complex and large structure . A movement of only 2 Å at the  1 -  1 loop in the ligand binding site is transmitted through an intricate shape - shifting pathway a distance of 40 Å across the  I domain . A 10 - Å  7 helix movement like that of a connecting rod in the  I domain causes the hybrid domain to swing out by pivot - ing at its other connection to the  I domain . The length of the hy - brid domain is 40 Å , and the PSI and I - EGF1 domains attached at the end opposite the  I domain make the total length of the upper integrin  leg  70 Å . The leverlike swing of the upper leg ampli - fies the 2 - Å movement of the  1 -  1 loop to a 75 - Å increase in separation at the integrin knees ( Fig . 1 ) . The integrin headpiece is a marvelous biological machine that appears designed for the dif - ficult job of transmitting allostery in extracellular environments . If in general the open headpiece is the high affinity state of integ - rins , induction by inside - out signals of headpiece opening can be a general mechanism for integrin activation on cell surfaces .
