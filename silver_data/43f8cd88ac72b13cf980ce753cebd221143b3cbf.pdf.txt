Abstract Progress in understanding the structure – function relationships of the mycobacter - ial cell wall has been hampered by its complex architecture as well as by the lack of sensitive , high - resolution probing techniques . For the ﬁrst time , we used atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to image the surface topography of hydrated Mycobacter - ium bovis bacillus Calmette Gu´erin cells and to investigate the inﬂuence of the antimycobacterial drug ethambutol on the cell wall architecture . While untreated cells showed a very smooth and homogeneous surface morphology , incubation of cells in the presence of ethambutol caused dramatic changes of the ﬁne surface structure . At 4 m g mL (cid:1) 1 , the drug created concentric striations at the cell surface and disrupted a (cid:2) 8 nm thick cell wall layer , attributed to the outer electron - opaque layer usually seen by electron microscopy , while at 10 m g mL (cid:1) 1 an underlying (cid:2) 12 nm thick layer reﬂecting the thick electron - transparent layer was also altered . These noninvasive ultrastructural investigations provide novel information on the macromolecular architecture of the mycobacterial envelope as well as into the destructuring effects of ethambutol . Introduction Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a Gram - positive pathogen which infects over one - third of the population in the world , causing annually 10 million new cases and 3 million deaths ( Raviglione , 2003 ) . The mycobacterial cell wall is highly complex and essential for growth and survival in the infected host . It also protects mycobacteria by restricting permeability to most hydrophilic antimicrobial compounds . Our present day understanding of its structure reveals an insoluble matrix as a crosslinked peptidoglycan linked to arabinogalactan , esteriﬁed at the distal ends to the mycolic acids . The other dominant feature is the lipoarabinoman - nan , somewhat embedded into the framework of the myco - lylarabinogalactan , and anchored into the cell membrane via its phosphatidylinositol portion ( Brennan & Nikaido , 1995 ) . Surrounding the wall , a capsule may also be present ( Daffe & Draper , 1998 ) . Although the major components of the cell envelope have been identiﬁed , their 3 - dimensional spatial arrangement remains largely unknown . In the absence of an effective vaccine , treatment with antimycobacterial drugs is the key weapon to limit the expansion of the tuberculosis pandemic . Some of the most effective drugs are known to inhibit the biosynthesis of cell wall components ( Kremer & Besra , 2002 ; Schroeder et al . , 2002 ) . Among these , ethambutol inhibits the synthesis of the polysaccharidic portion of the envelope , i . e . arabino - mannan and arabinogalactan ( Wolucka et al . , 1994 ) . Yet , due to the very complex architecture of the mycobacterial cell wall components , the molecular mechanisms by which antibiotics affect the cell wall structure and properties remain poorly understood . In the past decades , various characterization methods have been developed to probe the structural properties of microbial cell walls . While valuable information on the dynamics of cell wall assembly can be obtained using ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Daniel & Errington , 2003 ) , our current view of the cell wall ultrastructure essentially relies on electron microscopy techniques ( Beveridge & Graham , 1991 ) . Particularly , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) combined with freeze substitution has allowed to visualize the mycobacterial cell wall in conditions close to their native hydrated state ( Paul & Beveridge , 1992 ) . This elegant cryotechnique combines ultrarapid freezing with mild chemical ﬁxation , thereby avoiding shrinkage of hy - drated structures that would occur otherwise . These studies FEMS Microbiol Lett 264 ( 2006 ) 192 – 197 c (cid:3) 2006 Federation of EuropeanMicrobiological Societies Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd . All rights reserved and others ( for a review , see Brennan & Nikaido , 1995 ) have revealed that mycobacterial cell walls are complex , multi - layered structures composed of an inner layer of moderate electron density which contains peptidoglycan and is (cid:2) 4 nm thick , a (cid:2) 10 nm thick electron - transparent layer ( ETL ) which appears to be the hydrophobic domain of the cell wall and is dominated by mycolic acids covalently bound to arabinogalactan , and an outer electron - opaque layer ( OL ) of variable thickness , containing polysaccharides , glycopro - teins and glycolipids . Clearly , it is interesting to attempt complementing these thin section TEM analyses with three - dimensional views of the cell surface obtained in aqueous solution . The atomic force microscope ( AFM ; Binnig et al . , 1986 ) has recently proven to be a powerful addition to the range of cell surface analysis techniques ( for a review , see Dufreˆne , 2004 ) . An exciting feature of AFM is the possibility to directly visualize the effect of external agents such as enzymes and antibiotics on the microbial cell surface . In the ﬁrst such study , the action of penicillin on the morphol - ogy of Bacillus subtilis cells was investigated using AFM in air ( Kasas et al . , 1994 ) . In other work , changes in the morphology of Escherichia coli induced by cefodizime were demonstrated , again in the dried state ( Bragga & Ricci , 1998 ) . Although these reports represent an important pre - liminary step towards the application of AFM in drug – mi - croorganism interaction studies , their relevance is limited by the drying procedure applied during sample preparation . Here , we provide the ﬁrst high - resolution AFM images of hydrated Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette Gu´erin ( BCG ) surfaces before and after exposure to ethambutol . We found that the drug dramatically alters the ﬁne surface architecture of the cells , by ( i ) removing outer cell wall layers to an extent that depends on the drug concentration and by ( ii ) revealing concentric striations on top of the remaining layers . Materials and methods Bacterial cultures Mycobacterium bovis BCG was grown in Sauton medium as described elsewhere ( Menozzi et al . , 1996 ) . Brieﬂy , myco - bacteria were cultured at 37 1 C for about 3 weeks ( OD 600nm (cid:2) 0 . 6 ) in static conditions using 75 - cm 2 Roux ﬂasks that contain 50 mL of Sauton medium supplemented with Triton WR1339 . For some experiments , cells were resuspended for 24 or 72 h in Sauton medium containing ethambutol at concentrations of 4 or 10 m g mL (cid:1) 1 , corre - sponding to c . 1 or 2 . 5 times the minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) , respectively . All cells were harvested by centrifugation , washed three times with deionized water , and resuspended to a concentration of (cid:2) 10 8 cells mL (cid:1) 1 . AFM measurements AFM images were recorded in contact mode using an optical lever microscope equipped with a liquid cell ( Nanoscope IV Multimode AFM ; Veeco Metrology Group , Santa Barbara , CA ) . To image mycobacteria in their native state by AFM , the bacteria were immobilized by mechanical trapping onto Isopore polycarbonate membranes ( Millipore ) , with pore size similar to the cell size ( Kasas & Ikai , 1995 ; Dufreˆne et al . , 1999 ) . This approach is well suited to image single cells under aqueous conditions , and it does not involve chemical treatment or drying which would cause rearrangement or denaturation of the surface molecules ( Dufreˆne , 2004 ) . After ﬁltering a concentrated cell suspension , the ﬁlter was gently rinsed with deionized water , carefully cut ( 1 (cid:4) 1 cm ) , at - tached to a steel sample puck ( Veeco Metrology Group LLC ) using a small piece of adhesive tape and the mounted sample was transferred into the AFM liquid cell . Height and deﬂection images were recorded at room temperature ( 20 1 C ) with a minimal applied force ( o 500 pN ) , using oxide - sharpened microfabricated Si 3 N 4 cantilevers ( Micro - levers ; Veeco Metrology LLC ) with spring constant of 0 . 01 N m (cid:1) 1 ( manufacturer speciﬁed ) . While height images provide quantitative information on sample surface topo - graphy , deﬂection images often exhibit higher contrast of the morphological details . Results and discussion Surface structure of native M . bovis BCG cells To image mycobacteria in their native state by AFM , these were mechanically immobilized onto polycarbonate mem - branes , thus allowing cell imaging in buffer without pre - treatment such as air drying or chemical ﬁxation . Representative images of native M . bovis BCG are shown in Fig . 1 . Owing to the large curvature of cells , the image obtained in the height mode ( Fig . 1a ) has fairly poor resolution , while the image obtained in the deﬂection mode ( Fig . 1b ) is much more sensitive to the surface relief . Depending on the region investigated , cells were either aggregated ( Fig . 1b ) or isolated ( Fig . 1c ) . We note that despite the unfavorable rod - like morphology of the cells , their immobilization was very successful . In fact , as opposed to what is usually observed with spherical cells ( some bacteria , fungal spores , yeasts ) , most mycobacteria were found not to be trapped into the pores of the polymer membrane , but to be ﬁrmly attached on its surface , a behavior that may reﬂect strong hydrophobic interactions between the cells and the polycarbonate membrane . High - resolution images of the cell surface could be recorded without signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the surface morphology ( Fig . 1d ) . The surface was rather homogeneous and smooth , the root mean square ( rms ) roughness being FEMS Microbiol Lett 264 ( 2006 ) 192 – 197 c (cid:3) 2006 Federation of EuropeanMicrobiological Societies Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd .

We suggest it represents essentially the electron - dense outer layer ( OL ) , rather than a loosely bound capsule , for the following reasons . First , mycobacterial capsular material is known to be loosely bound and easily displaced during the conven - tional processing of samples for microscopy or upon treat - ment with glass beads ( Daffe & Etienne , 1999 ) . As our sample preparation procedure involves washing by succes - sive cycles of resuspension / centrifugation and ﬁltering through a porous polymer membrane , it should cause detachment of the loosely bound capsular material . Second , the surface was remarkably smooth and not affected by repeated scanning . This is not consistent with the presence of loosely bound macromolecules , which should result in imaging artifacts in the form of streaks oriented in the scanning direction ( van der Aa et al . , 2001 ) . Third , approach force curves ( data not shown ) did not show signiﬁcant deformation in the contact region , indicating the surface was rather stiff , while retraction force curves never showed any elongation forces expected for soft , loosely bound macromolecules ( van der Aa et al . , 2001 ) . Nanoscale surface alterations induced by ethambutol The surface morphology of mycobacteria was then investi - gated following incubation for 24 h with 4 m g mL (cid:1) 1 etham - butol , a concentration close to the MIC ( Fig . 2 ) .

Verbelen et al . seen in Fig . 2a , the ultrastructural integrity of the cell was maintained and the cell surface was clean and well - resolved , indicating that the treatment was gentle and did not cause visible cell breakage . However , signiﬁcant alterations of the ﬁne surface structure were seen on closer examination : most cells showed a nanostructured external layer possessing concentric rings or striations ( Fig . 2b and c ) . This layer covered only part of the cell surface and was 8 (cid:5) 1 nm thick , as revealed by cross - sections taken in height images ( Fig . 2d ) . To assess whether the observed changes depended on the drug concentration , we also imaged cells following incubation with 10 m g mL (cid:1) 1 ethambutol , corresponding to 2 . 5 times the MIC ( Fig . 3 ) . Clearly , cell surface alterations were more pronounced , i . e . striations were more evident , and the surface showed two superimposed layers of 8 (cid:5) 1 and 12 (cid:5) 1 nm , respectively . These AFM observations are consistent with electron microscopy data , which revealed a multilayered organiza - tion for the mycobacterial cell wall ( Brennan & Nikaido , 1995 ) . In fact , the (cid:2) 8 nm thick striated layer observed at both 4 and 10 m g mL (cid:1) 1 ethambutol may reﬂect the outer layer ( OL ) , while the (cid:2) 12 nm thick layer observed only at 10 m g mL (cid:1) 1 would correspond to the underlying electron - transparent layer ( ETL ) of mycolic acids esteriﬁed to arabi - nogalactan . This is consistent with the mode of action of ethambutol , which primarily inhibits arabinan polymeriza - tion , thus its incorporation in the cell wall . Hence , etham - butol used at the MIC would impair the formation of the OL . Above the MIC , ethambutol seems to cause detachment of the mycolic acids , which could no longer be esteriﬁed to arabinogalactan . This global destructuration of the wall could be ampliﬁed by the inhibition of lipoarabinomannan biosynthesis that occurs at such concentration of the drug . We also note that our AFM images showing two layers are in agreement with the known observation that mycobacterial cell wall can be cleaved by the process of freeze - fracture and D D ( a ) ( c ) ( b ) ( d ) ( d ) 100 nm 100 nm 500 nm 50 nm − 8 − 6 − 4 − 2 02 4 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 H e i gh t ( n m ) Distance ( nm ) Fig . 2 .

The original smooth surface of the mycobacterial cell and its transforma - tion in a ﬁbrous structure has been previously observed by electron microscopists ( K¨olbel , 1984 ) . It was proposed that these alterations must be regarded more as artifacts due to drastic conditions of sample preparation that induce re - arrangements of hydrophilic – hydrophobic lipids to form rope - like structures . Importantly , the observation of such structures following ethambutol treatment using an in situ noninvasive technique suggests they may reﬂect the global organization of the structural polar lipids of the cell wall . Further work is needed to understand the relevance of these striations and to establish whether they are related to the mode of assembly of arabinogalactan or other cell wall components . Also , using AFM force spectroscopy it would be most interesting to investigate to what extent the cell wall mechanical properties are altered upon incubation with the drug , while varying the concentration and incuba - tion time . In summary , our results represent the ﬁrst in situ , i . e . under physiological conditions , visualization of nanoscale alterations induced in mycobacterial cell walls upon incuba - tion with ethambutol . The drug causes disruption of cell wall layers , presumably the OL and ETL layers , and induces characteristic concentric striations that may be related to the mode of assembly of arabinogalactan . We feel that the nondestructive high - resolution imaging capability of AFM exploited here is a valuable complementary approach to electron microscopy techniques and has a great potential for exploring antibiotic – cell wall interactions on the nanoscale .
