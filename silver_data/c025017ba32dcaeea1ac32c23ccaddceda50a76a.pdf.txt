Heil 3 , J . Douglas Armstrong 3 & Oksana Sorokina 3 Polymerisation of clathrin is a key process that underlies clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Clathrin - coated vesicles are responsible for cell internalization of external substances required for normal homeostasis and life – sustaining activity . There are several hypotheses describing formation of closed clathrin structures . According to one of the proposed mechanisms cage formation may start from a flat lattice buildup on the cellular membrane , which is later transformed into a curved structure . Creation of the curved surface requires rearrangement of the lattice , induced by additional molecular mechanisms . Different potential mechanisms require a modeling framework that can be easily modified to compare between them . We created an extendable rule - based model that describes polymerisation of clathrin molecules and various scenarios of cage formation . Using Global Sensitivity Analysis ( GSA ) we obtained parameter sets describing clathrin pentagon closure and the emergence / production and closure of large - size clathrin cages / vesicles . We were able to demonstrate that the model can reproduce budding of the clathrin cage from an initial flat array . Clathrin is the major protein component of clathrin – mediated endocytosis ( CME ) 1 , 2 . Due to its particular shape and ( auto - ) polymerization capacity , clathrin is believed to induce the cell membrane to adopt a vesicular shape . A range of different mechanisms have been proposed for this process 3 – 5 , from a few minimalistic ones propose that clathrin polymerization alone is sufficient to generate buds in a planar membrane 6 to the consensus that describe the orchestrated action of additional proteins and signaling cascades on the intracellular side of the membrane , so that ~ 30 proteins directly participate in the various steps of endocytosis 1 , 7 – 9 . The structural properties of clathrin have been extensively investigated with respect to their role in vesicle for - mation . Usually a clathrin molecule is composed of one heavy ( ~ 190 kDa ) as well as one light chain ( ~ 25 kD ) and is about 475 Ångström ( Å ) in length 10 . Within the cell clathrin exists in a form of trimers ( triskelia ) , consisting of three clathrin molecules ( three heavy and three light chains respectively ) , where individual clathrin monomers are referred to as “legs” . Deviating from the normal 1 : 1 ratio between light and heavy chain several studies have also revealed the existence of triskelia with fewer light chains . Triskelia formation itself does not seem to be influ - enced by a loss of light chain molecules 11 , but regulatory control of vesicle formation and cargo selection have been proposed . Due to its internal trimeric structure every single clathrin molecule in the triskelia complex can polymerize with another clathrin molecule from a different clathrin triskelia . Hence every triskelia is able to undergo interac - tions with three further triskelia . This leads to the formation of dimers and trimers , which can grow to construct large polymers . However , in a normal biological context , hexagonal and pentagonal shapes are among the most frequently observed 12 , 13 . Specific combinations of these shapes induce the formation of the typical vesicle closed spherical structure . Normally , closed structures contain 12 pentagonal faces and ( N - 20 ) / 2 hexagonal faces .

Based on the number ( N ) of triskelia different sphere sizes can emerge , three of which are well defined : The mini - coat , hexagonal - barrel and soccer ball 13 . Since its discovery in 1975 14 , significant attention has been focused on the mechanism of clathrin polymerisa - tion . It was highlighted in 1 that understanding CME is not possible without proper knowledge of its key process , the clathrin cage formation . Although it was experimentally shown that clathrin self - assembles following pH decrease from 8 to 6 . 5 15 or under bivalent cation administration 16 , to obtain biologically realistic vesicle shapes the participation of external regulatory proteins is likely critical 1 . A range of computational models for clathrin self - assembly exists that describes the formation of clathrin cages 12 , 13 , 17 – 19 , or pits and vesicles 13 , 15 , 20 . Early models considered the association of 3 - valent polymers with equi - reactive binding sites from the Flori’s theory point of view with 20 or without 21 allowance for intramolecular loop formation . These studies dissected the dependence of the solution / gel phase transition linked to the critical concentration of the monomer on the equilibrium constants of different steps of the polymerisation process . In the early theoretical models of multivalent condensation , the term “gel” was used to describe the situation when the majority of agents participate in one global complex . There are two phases in such system : a solution consisting of many small complexes and monomers , and a gel , composed of one global complex and a few free monomers . The formation of the global complex is a key phase transition in the systems dynamics . Prior to gel formation , the dynamics of the system are driven by bi - molecular reactions ( when two complexes form a bigger one , or a monomer attaches to the complex ) . After gel formation , the dynamics are driven by uni - molecular reactions within the complex . The key finding of Falk and Thomas 20 is that before the transition to the gel phase , uni - molecular reactions are negligible . In particular , it was shown by Pastan and Willingham 15 , that the critical concentration of clathrin , sufficient for the phase transition was 30 mg / ml . Taking into account that the triskelia molecular mass is about 640 kDa , this value corresponds to the molar concentration of 46 µ M , or approximately 55000 triskelia per eukaryotic cell . More recent studies examined the assembly of 5 - and 6 - member rings in parallel with investigation of how different physical triskelia characteristics might impact on cage formation . These characteristics include triskelia rigidity 21 , their asymmetry 17 , emergent tension during cage closure 22 and the effects of superficial membrane ten - sion 23 . These studies provide approximations of binding energy between the chains of the neighbouring clathin triskelia 17 . The polymerisation process alone presents a significant challenge for mechanistic modeling , as the num - ber of molecular species , which have to be described , grows exponentially with the number of available mono - mers . Rule - based modeling 24 – 26 provides a viable solution allowing a network – free simulation technique 27 – 29 . It uses ‘lumped’ reaction rules to concisely represent molecule interactions . One can assume the rules as implicit combinations of different reactions into classes , where all the members of the same class perform a common transformation . This modeling approach is generally exploited for large - scale biochemical systems to overcome combinatorial complexity and it has previously demonstrated its effectiveness in simulations of ligand - receptor complex polymerization 25 . Here we present a suite of rule - based models of clathrin polymerisation with increasing complexity , starting from a very basic model where the molecule has three equally reactive binding sites to a more advanced model reproducing realistic triskelia clathrin structure . We examined the correspondence of each model’s behavior with the existing theoretical models while sampling from a wide range of parameter values . We found that although the basic model exactly reproduces Flory’s findings , it is unable to provide the amounts of 5 - and 6 - member rings required for cage formation and , therefore , it fails to reproduce clathrin vesicle formation . A revised model with a more realistic clathrin structure that explicitly supports predominant closure of pentagons and hexagons allows 3D cage formation and permits the evolution of flat 2D clathrin patches into a 3D cage structures by shifting the ratio of the pentagon / hexagon dissociation constants . Methods Models and simulation . We used the Kappa language 30 , a member of the family of rule - based modeling languages , for building the models . All models were simulated by KaSim3 . 5 ( http : / / dev . executableknowledge . org / ) . We used Kappa extensions where appropriate , e . g the MetaKappa ( https : / / github . com / kappamodeler / metakappa ) extension for building the first model to handle the combinatorial explosion caused by three equal binding sites ( see Appendix for details ) . Also , we use the RKappa extension 31 for sampling the large parameter space , statistical analysis of simulation results , global sensitivity analysis ( GSA ) and visualization of the Kappa molecular structures as more comprehensible 2D and 3D graphs . We first investigated the capability of rule - based models to reproduce clathrin cage structures based on ran - dom self - assembly processes . For this we assume that clathrin triskelia interact in 3D , in a well - mixed solution and all binding sites of the clathrin triskelia are assumed to be identical . Due to the combinatorial nature of the clathrin molecule association , the size of aggregates is unbounded and limited only by the amount of available substrate . We started with a reduced model of triskelia monomers similar to Perelson and Goldstein’s equilibrium and continuous model 21 , in which monomers carry three identical equally reactive binding sites . Two variants of this model were implemented in the rule - based Kappa language to investigate the polymerization of branched com - plexes from a single class of trivalent agents under ‘rings allowed’ and ‘rings forbidden’ conditions similar to that proposed by 20 ( Model 1 ) . We then developed a more elaborate model , based on clathrin monomers , that considers triskelia as a prede - fined complex of three monomers . This model more accurately reproduces the structure of clathrin with distinct legs and binding sites along with specified defined steric and chirality constraints ( Model 2 ) . It also contains explicit rules describing formation of penta - and hexagonal rings and demonstrates the dynamics of closed cage www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 Scientific REPORtS | ( 2018 ) 8 : 5658 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 23829 - x structure formation . All the models presented here are kinetic and do not include notions of space . However these could be added by use of existing extensions like SpatialKappa 26 or Geometric Kappa 32 if required later . Equireactive trivalent agent model . In the first model ( Model 1 ) we simplify the realistic triskelia struc - ture of clathrin to the trivalent agent Cl3 with three identical binding sites . This is effectively a kinetic version of the model described by Perelson and Goldstein in 1985 16 , 21 ( Fig . 1A , Supplementary Data ) . As clathrin is known to aggregate on the membrane , we assume that with complex growth its ability to diffuse would decrease . Thus , in our configuration complex growth happens preferentially via addition of new monomers rather than merging of existing complexes , in the same way as in Perelson and Goldstein . The ( kappa ) rule looks as follows : proximalbinding a A A A a A a A A A a A pbk ‘ ’ ( , , ) , ( ) ( ! 1 , , ) , ( ! 1 ) @ ‘ ’ ( 0 ) , − > where ‘ pbk’ is the rate of binding . To ensure stability of the rings in clathrin complexes we make an assumption that molecules with three occu - pied binding sites cannot dissociate . Thus , dissociation is only possible at the periphery of the complex when at least one binding site is / remains free . proximaldissociation a A A a A a A A a A pdk ‘ ’ ( ! 1 , ) , ( ! 1 ) ( , ) , ( ) @ ‘ ’ , − > where ‘pdk’ is the rate of dissociation . This rule partially contradicts the work of Perelson and Goldstein , where the dissociation is possible only at the monomer level . However , the rule includes the dissociation of terminal monomers as a special case . We studied the random polymerisation of trivalent monomers under two traditional Flory - Stockmayer assumptions : ‘ring forbidden’ ( Model 1 A ) and ‘rings allowed ( Model 1B ) . In the case of Model 1 A ( ‘rings forbidden’ ) , the intramolecular bonds between the binding sites of the same polymers are not allowed as the only free agent ( with all three sites non - occupied ) can bind the polymer . The detailed models for the original Perelson’s model and its two Kappa implementations : Model 1 A and Model 1B are presented in Supplementary Data . In the case of Model 1B ( ‘ring allowed’ ) intra - molecular reactions are allowed , so that rings of different sizes may occur . As in 20 , 21 , 33 reactions occur with an equal probability for each of the free binding site to react until the reaction extent R ext = 1 , which means that all binding sites are fully occupied . Although cubical structures of clathrin were observed experimentally under special conditions 34 , the formation of rings of size 4 and less is not reported under conditions approximating intracellular environments . Hence we set a specific constraint on the polymer chain ability to make intramolecular bonds only when ring size ( nring ) exceeds 5 bonds in length . ringclosure a A a A a A a A pring nring ‘ ’ ( ) , ( ) ( ! 1 ) , ( ! 1 ) @ ‘ ’ ( 0 0 : ‘ ’ ) − > . In the rule above ‘pring’ is a rate of ring closure , while ‘nring’ refers to the minimal number of bonds in the ring ( set to 5 in this case ) . The constraints enforce limitations on the condition of equal reactivity to be always fulfilled ; yet the probability to close a short ring within a large complex is quite small . We also assume the equilibrium constants for initiation , elongation and branching are equal . Triskelia model . To generate a more realistic model we next considered clathrin monomers and their struc - tural properties . Each monomer consists of a proximal region ( “P” , light green in Fig . 1B ) , which contains a binding domain on its “right” , long part ( “r” ) and “left” , short part ( “l” ) , and the distal region ( “d” , dark green in Fig . 1B ) . Domains in the proximal region facilitate the internal binding of monomers to form trimers . The addi - tional binding sites “Pp” and “Pd” in the proximal region allow binding amongst different triskelia . Binding rules Figure 1 . Structure of agents for Model 1 and Model 2 . Three identical binding sites in a simple agent ( A ) interact with each other to form a lattice ( Model1 ) . Monomer ( B ) of detailed Model 2 has two sites to form the triskelia hub ( l , r ) and three sites to interact with other triskelia ( d , Pd , Pp ) ( C ) . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 4 Scientific REPORtS | ( 2018 ) 8 : 5658 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 018 - 23829 - x presume the ‘right’ part of one monomer can only bind to the “left” part of another , and so forth to make correct triskelia structures ( Fig . 1C ) . In kappa language this is expressed in the following way : Cl l r Cl r l Cl r l ( ! 1 , ! 2 ) , ( ! 1 , ! 3 ) , ( ! 3 , ! 2 ) “Cl” refers to a single clathrin molecule with proximal right ( “r” ) and left ( “l” ) binding site . All distal parts of the long legs are oriented in one direction , showing a clockwise drift / turn ( Fig . 1C ) . Once assembled , triskelia form the structural unit for the polymerisation process , which is governed by the interaction of domains localised on the right , long leg of each monomer . These are : a proximal ( Pp ) , a distal “receiving” ( Pd ) and distal “giving” ( d ) domain . Based on the given clathrin triskelia structure , formation of one bond utilizes four triskelia simultaneously : two monomers bind with their proximal parts , and two form addi - tional bonds with their distal parts ( see Supplementary Data for triskelia binding code and a visualization ) . As was shown by den Otter et al . 17 and Fotin et al . 35 , the proper orientation of all four legs is vital for formation of closed structures . Initial polymerization steps along with the model rules are presented in detail in Supplementary Data . In addition to the binding rule , a few specific rules enforce the closure / formation of pentagons and hexagons . Dissociation is implemented as follows . Closed rings cannot be reopened . At least one monomer needs to be unbound for dissociation to happen . Details can be seen in the model code in the Supplementary Data , which shows the rules used in the current model version . Data Availability . All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article ( and its Supplementary Information files ) . Results We investigated the ability of rule - based models to reproduce the clathrin cage structures based on a random self - assembly process . Specifically , two traditional Flory - Stockmayer conditions : “rings forbidden” and “rings allowed” were applied separately , similar to 20 . All models were simulated 5000 times with parameter ranges shown in Table 1 . Trivalent model . In the first model we used a simplified triskelia structure of clathrin with a trivalent agent Cl3 containing three identical binding sites with equal reactivity , similar to the Perelson and Goldstain model in 1985 21 . The key parameters that have been analyzed are ( see also 21 ) : = ∗ ∗ R N amount 2 3 ( 1 ) ext bond α = ∗ ∗ = ∗ ∗ ∗ = ∗ ∗ τ τ K C pbk N V pdk N pbk pdk 6 6 ( ) 6 ( 2 ) A where R ext - reaction extent , α - nondimensional equilubrium constant , N bond - the number of bonds in the poly - mer , and K – the equilibrium constant . C t and N t describe the total concentration and total number of monomers ( respectively ) , amount – amount of available triskelia . We showed that in the “ring forbidden” setup , the distribution of free clathrin with dependence on R ext exactly followed the prediction of Perelson’s theory ( Fig . 2A and B ) . The vast majority of parameter sets in “ring forbid - den” are grouped around R ext = 0 . 5 , and the dependency between R ext and N bond / N t is linear . We found that R ext never exceeded the theoretical limit of gel formation ( Fig . 2B ) while in most of the “ring allowed” instances , reac - tions stopped only when the available binding sites were saturated ( Fig . 2B and D ) . To explore the types of complexes our simulations produced , we calculated the size of the largest aggregate ( W max ) and the number of the rings in the system . The latter was estimated as the cyclomatic number of the clath - rin graph , which is the number of bonds that need to be removed to form an acyclic graph : C E V C ( 3 ) rank g g g = − + Structure Max number g531 2 g532 4 g541 16 g551 250 g643 2 g651 4 g661 36 Table 1 .

C g is the number of connected components in the graph . We found that the number of rings in the system C rank almost always reached the theoretical limit ( Fig . 2D ) , where the total number of monomers was equal to the size of the largest aggregate ( W max ) in agreement with analysis from Falk et al . 20 . In agreement with 20 , when intramolecular bonds are allowed ( Model 1b ) ring formation only starts after gel structure formation ( Fig . 2D ) , when the reaction extent reaches the 0 . 5 threshold . This means that in the simple agent model closed cages would be formed only when 7 / 8 of the available clathrins form a large single complex . Further analysis ( Supplementary Data ) shows that probability of the ring closure grows with the size of the ring . Therefore , the number of short rings ( pentagons and hexagons ) is quite low even when we set the rate of the ring closure reactions to infinity ( Supplementary Data and Fig . 3 ) . Therefore we conclude that the simple model is not able to describe the closed cage structures , as the clathrin geometry provides the optimal mutual disposition of the monomers only when 5 - and 6 - membered rings are formed . To resolve this we developed a more plausible model as follows . Triskelia model . Model 2 described above corresponds to a more realistic structure of clathrin with distinct regions within the monomer and respective binding sites that reflect the experimental literature 10 , 12 . We also introduced a specific rule for orientation of the monomers to ensure that the “right” site of one monomer binds the “left” side of another . This preserves the correct geometry of triskelia and chirality of the monomers . To ensure we obtain realistic clathrin complexes , 5 - and 6 - ring closure reactions were explicitly specified . We started with parameter sampling for the model . To ensure comparability between simulations we used the same parameter sets as before by assigning the ring closure rate the value of “pring” to both hexagons and penta - gons . Again , the two cases - “ring forbidden” and “ring allowed” were investigated . The behavior of the “ring forbidden” version of Model 2 is clearly similar to the behavior of the Model 1 and theoretical predictions of Perelson ( Fig . 4A ) . The number of free triskelia monotonically decreases towards zero at R ext = 0 . 6 . The difference between the theoretical prediction of 0 . 5 and the observed value is explained by the association rule in the Model 2 , which does not prevent associations of clusters and therefore does not follow the monomer attachment mechanisms considered in Perelson 21 . Association between clusters results in a higher numbers of triskelia with all their legs involved in the complex formation , which in turn prevents their dissociation . The “ring allowed” version of the Model 2 ( Fig . 4B ) follows the same scenario as Model 1 ( Fig . 2D ) and behaves as predicted by theory 20 . Ring formation starts only after solution to gel transition at R ext = 0 . 6 . Contrary to the Model 1 , the number of rings does not grow linearly with the size of the complex ( Fig . 2C ) . Instead , due to Figure 2 . Simulation ( 5000 parameter sets ) of the trivalent model with “ring forbidden” ( A ) and “ring allowed” . ( C , D ) assumptions .

For simplicity of simulation and comparison with Model 1 we did not introduce separate kinetic constants for 5 - and 6 - ring closure . As a result , the vast majority of the rings in our simulations are pentagons . Nevertheless we observed a number of hexagons as well . The relatively high number of octagons observed is a consequence of high number of 5 - rings , as hull of two adjacent pentagons can form an octagon ( Fig . 5С ) . To explore the geometry of complexes , which contain 5 - and 6 - rings we used a set of all possible combi - nations of pentagons and hexagons as described in 22 . Table 2 shows that pentagons tend to form adjacent dodecahedron - like structures ( see g551 , Fig . 5A , Supplementary Figure 5 ) , while hexagons are most often sur - rounded by pentagons as visualized in structure g661 ( Fig . 5B ) . We found no clear distinction between ring forming and ring preventing values in parameter sets ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . To further investigate which parameters influence the ring formation the most we performed GSA on Model 2 with the “ring allowed” con - dition ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . We thus concluded that Model 2 is able to produce various structures of dif - ferent shapes ( Fig . 5 ) without the initial constraints , but that they do not all necessarily end up being cage - like structures . The type of clathrin cage formed in vivo is known to depend on the ratio of pentagons and hexagons 3 , 22 . Moreover , planar clathrin consists of just hexagons . As an example we tested to see whether our model could be reconciled wit the invagination mechanism ( e . g . described in Avinoam et al . 5 ) . Avinoam’s ( 2015 ) mechanism requires the presence of pentagons . To reproduce this we tuned the rate constants for pentagon and hexagon closure and changed the equilibrium of association and dissociation rates for them . First we simulated the model where only 6 - rings were allowed by setting the 5 - ring closure reaction to 0 to form a planar structure ( Fig . 6A and Supplementary movie 1 ) . When the reaction extent was close to 1 , 5 - ring closure was allowed by adjusting rate constant to non - zero value . With a rate of closure for 5 - and 6 - ring close to each other we observed invaginations , but they never reached the scissing stage so that the completely closed structure never occurred ( Supplementary movie 2 ) . At this point we set the rate of closure for 5 - rings to infinite and after 10 4 events we obtained the struc - tures shown in Fig . 6B and Supplementary Movie 3 . To evaluate the influence of rates of pentagon and hexagon closure / disruption we performed GSA on the model starting with a flat hexagonal mesh ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Here , b and d are the coefficients defining the extent to which pentagon closure is faster than hexagon closure ( b ) , and hexagon compared to pentagon dissoci - ation ( d ) ; rng5 and rng6 are the ratios of ring closure to ring disruption for pentagons and hexagons , respectively . For each parameter the significance level is calculated as described in 36 . The rate of the pentagon closure did not significantly influence any property of the system , while the rate of hexagon dissociation appeared important for the size of the most frequent complex ( wNmax ) and the presence of hexagon - containing subgraphs ( g501 , g511 , g521 , g522 , g601 , g611 , g621 , g622 , g631 , g632 , g633 , g641 , g642 , g643 in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ) 22 . During the course of a simulation we were able to obtain different numbers of closed cages in almost half of the parameter sets , which indicates that the formation of flat structures requires additional constraints , while cage formation happens spontaneously 4 . Discussion Computational models describing formation of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) 2 , 17 , 23 , 37 mostly focus on clathrin self - association or its association with the membrane .

Existing computational models struggle to incorporate these regulatory elements either because of high computational cost , which becomes prohibitive in case of incorporation of all involved protein types , or because the structure / type of the model can / does not include the reactions controlled by regulatory systems . For example , the equilibrium model 21 considered growth of pits as a linear set of reactions , assuming that all three legs of the new triskelia in the pit assemble using the best possible free sites in the net . As shown by simulations in 17 and confirmed in our Models 1 A and B this is not the case . As was proposed in 39 , these signaling processes can be incorporated into models as a modification of clathrin association / dissociation rates . With these factors in mind we have developed a model capable of describing the formation of CCVs , avoiding the more resource expensive computational algorithms and using a modeling for - mat familiar to the signal transduction modelling community . Our first version of the model , which described clathrin as a trivalent agent demonstrated that formation of closed structures required an additional manual closure to achieve 5 - and 6 - rings . With the flexibility of the clathrin molecule and no evidence for energy differences between penta - and hexameric rings we saw no pref - erences towards either specific ring composition . Weak interactions , which have been proposed to have a major effect on the association of clathrin legs 39 , and comparatively low bending energy of the clathrin lattice suggest that when on the flat part of the membrane , clathrin will create a flat hexagonal lattice . That process was consid - ered in 3 , where clathrin was modeled as hexagonal lattice with 5 - and 7 - sided rings occurring as defects , but the study only considered the equilibrium state , whereas in our analysis we were able to investigate the kinetics of the process . Although the “canonic” mechanism of clathrin pits formation proposes constant curvature growth as a function of clathrin polymerization 40 , the evolution of curved clathrin structures from flat plaque has also some supporting experimental evidence 5 , 38 . The recent study of Leyton - Puig et al . 7 reports the ability of clathrin plaques to act as hubs for CME and proposes actin polymerisation and actin - based adhesion are major regulating factors for their remodeling 7 . Our model shows that switching pentagon ring formation on / off allows the process to switch between planar patches and closed cages . In vivo , this switching could be driven by changes in physical properties of the mem - brane or by additional regulatory mechanisms 1 , 37 , 41 . In our model we assume the size and the shape of the clathrin lattice to be controlled by three processes : i ) the association / dissociation of triskelia ; ii ) the 5 - ring formation / dissociation and iii ) the 6 - ring formation / dissociation . Several other factors are known to influence the cage and coat formation and dissociation 42 , 43 . For example in 44 , the main difference in pentagon and hexagon closure is attributed to the stiffness of the underlying membrane , while in 41 the rigidity variation of the clathrin net itself is explained by binding to an adaptor protein ( AP2 , AP3 , AP180 ) 8 , 45 . Their influence on clathrin coat formation has been studied in distinct experimental set - ups and binding to clathrin has been confirmed . Due to their influence on clathrin triskelia structure and hence their ability to influence coat formation it might be debatable if their main role is in maintaining a flat structure or “forcing” / inducing the formation of vesicles . This mechanism could be easily embedded into the model ( see the example in Supplementary Data ) . The clathrin light chain is an additional part of the triskelia , which connects to the heavy chain in the region extending from the self - association domain to the knee 39 . One of the possible conformations can force the knee to bend in a direction that inhibits cage formation . This inhibitory effect is thought to be regulated ( inhibited ) by interaction with Ca ions or by lowering the pH 39 . The light chain also influences the rigidity of the clathrin lattice and its ability to bend the lipid membrane at low temperature 4 . The light chain contains 19 serines that are potential kinase targets ( GRK2 ) and phosphorylation of the light chain has been proposed as a discriminator for different cargo inclusion in the vesicle 46 . An example of how the model can be extended to incorporate the above mechanism is presented in Supplementary Data . The rule - based approach we have used allows us to build and compare kinetic models that describe different possible mechanisms of clathrin cage formation , from direct assembly from monomers at the vesicle budding Figure 6 .

More in depth functional details such as the role of N - WASP through Arp2 / 3 7 can help to expand models and gain deeper insights . Hence , our implementation is easily extendable allowing the future inclusion of more detailed mechanistic models of CME regulation . References 1 . McMahon , H . T . & Boucrot , E .
