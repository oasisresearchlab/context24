Rheological disturbances ( high shear stress ) have an important role in promoting arterial thrombosis by enhancing the adhesive and signaling function of platelet integrin α IIb β 3 ( GPIIb - IIIa ) . In this study we have defined a key role for the Type Ia phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) p110 β isoform in regulating the formation and stability of integrin α IIb β 3 adhesion bonds , necessary for shear activation of platelets . Isoform - selective PI3K p110 β inhibitors have been developed which prevent formation of stable integrin α IIb β 3 adhesion contacts , leading to defective platelet thrombus formation . In vivo , these inhibitors eliminate occlusive thrombus formation but do not prolong bleeding time . These studies define PI3K p110 β as an important new target for antithrombotic therapy . Acute myocardial infarction and stroke represent the leading causes of death and disability in the industrialized world . A common precipi - tating factor for these diseases is the sudden rupturing or fissuring of advanced atherosclerotic lesions , leading to excessive platelet and fibrin accumulation . A number of factors contribute to the heightened throm - bogenic potential of ruptured plaques , including the high reactivity of adhesive substrates in the plaque 1 , 2 , the presence of tissue factor 3 – 5 and the indirect platelet - activating effects of high shear caused by narrowing of the vessel lumen by the atherothrombotic process 6 – 8 . Reductions in the luminal diameter of blood vessels , owing to the combined effects of atherosclerosis , vasoconstriction and thrombus development , result in a marked increase in blood flow velocity and a concomitant increase in shear stress . High shear stress and shear gradients are characteristic features of arterial thrombosis and analysis of thrombus formation in vivo has shown a major role for rapid increases in shear in promoting platelet activation and thrombus growth 9 . Platelet thrombus formation is crucially dependent on the adhesive and signaling functions of integrin α IIb β 3 ( platelet GPIIb - IIIa ) , a major platelet integrin that mediates platelet – vessel wall and platelet - plate - let adhesive interactions through engagement of multiple adhesive ligands , including von Willebrand factor ( vWf ) , fibrinogen , fibronec - tin and soluble CD40L 10 . All existing antiplatelet agents target one or more key steps in the thrombotic mechanism , which ultimately downregulate the adhesive function of integrin α IIb β 3 ; however , a con - siderable limitation of current therapies is their deleterious effects on hemostasis , leading to bleeding complications 11 . An ideal antithrom - botic therapy would selectively target an event crucial for pathological thrombus formation without affecting hemostasis . One such strategy would be to attenuate the ability of platelets to form stable integrin α IIb β 3 adhesion contacts under high shear stress by targeting shear - sensitive signaling processes in platelets . To date , the identification of signaling elements crucial for shear activation of platelets , but not for hemostasis , have remained elusive . An important signaling pathway promoting shear activation of plate - lets involves the PI3Ks 12 , 13 . These lipid kinases are divided into three distinct classes ( Class I , II and III ) based on their primary structure , mode of regulation and substrate specificity 14 , 15 . The Class I PI3Ks are responsible for agonist - induced production of the second messengers phosphoinositide ( PI ) ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , and participate in the regulation of a broad range of functional platelet responses , including activation of integrin α IIb β 316 . The Class I enzymes are further divided into α , β , δ and γ isoforms based on their distinct p110 catalytic sub - units and modes of regulation . The Class Ia isoforms ( p110 α , p110 β , p110 δ ) are classically regulated by tyrosine kinases , whereas the Class Ib isoform ( p110 γ ) is typically activated by G - protein - coupled recep - tors 17 . Platelets contain all Class I PI3K isoforms , although the levels of 1 Australian Centre for Blood Diseases , Monash University , 6 th Floor Burnet Building Alfred Medical Research and Education Precinct ( AMREP ) , 89 Commercial Road , Prahran , Victoria , Australia 3181 . 2 Department of Pharmacology , Level 8 , Medical Building , Corner of Grattan Street and Royal Parade , University of Melbourne , Victoria , Australia 3010 . 3 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , University College of London , Gower Street , London , WC1E6BT , UK . 4 Kinacia Pty Ltd , Cerylid Biosciences Ltd , 576 Swan Street , Richmond , Victoria , Australia 3121 . 5 These authors contributed equally to this work .

To date , the role of the individual PI3K isoforms in regulating platelet functional responses has been poorly defined and there is currently no information on the role of individual PI3K isoforms in regulating shear activation of platelets . RESULTSPI3K regulates integrin α IIb β 3 adhesive bond stability Previous studies have defined a key role for PI3K in promoting the initial formation of integrin α IIb β 3 adhesive bonds under high shear 12 , 21 and there is evidence that PI3Ks operate downstream of each of the major platelet receptors involved in shear - induced platelet activation , notably glycoprotein ( GP ) Ib 22 , 23 , integrin α IIb β 321 and the ADP purinergic receptor P2Y 1213 , 24 . The specific PI3K isoforms involved in this process and the importance of these enzymes in main - taining the stability of formed integrin α IIb β 3 adhesion bonds have not been established . To investigate this , platelets were perfused through fibrinogen - coated microcapillary tubes at low shear to enable formation of integrin α IIb β 3 adhesion bonds , then exposed to sudden accelerations in blood flow , thereby increasing tensile stress on formed bonds . Of platelets adher - ent to fibrinogen , 63 . 8 ± 6 . 0 % were able to resist the detaching effects of rapid increases in shear , whereas 27 . 4 ± 6 . 3 % of platelets pretreated with the pharmacological PI3K inhibitor LY294002 were able to maintain firm adhesion ( Fig . 1a ) . Previous studies have established an impor - tant role for integrin α IIb β 3 – dependent calcium flux , in combination with released ADP , in promoting shear - resistant platelet adhesion 25 . Consistent with an important role for PI3Ks in this process , LY294002 completely inhibited calcium flux in fibrinogen - adherent platelets ( Fig . 1b ) , either in the presence or absence of ADP receptor antago - nists ( data not shown ) . To investigate the identity of the PI3K isoforms a b c d e f a b c d Figure 1 PI3K promotes cytosolic calcium flux and stable platelet adhesion on immobilized fibrinogen following exposure to rapid increases in shear . Calcium dye – loaded human platelets ( a , b ) or those isolated from PI3K p110 γ – containing ( γ + ) , p110 γ – deficient ( γ – ) ( c , d ) or PI3K p110 δ – deficient ( δ – ) ( d , e ) mice were pretreated with vehicle alone ( Me 2 SO ) , the non - isoform - selective PI3K inhibitor LY294002 ( LY , 25 µ M ) , and / or ADP inhibitors ( ØADP : apyrase ( 1 . 5 U / ml ) , MRS - 2179 ( 100 µ M ) , AR - C69931MX ( 10 µ M ) ) , as indicated . The results represent the percentage of platelets ( a , c , e ) becoming displaced from the point of initial contact , and ( b , d ) undergoing a sustained oscillatory calcium response following an increase in shear from 150 s – 1 to 1 , 800 s – 1 for human and 600 s - 1 to 10 , 000 s – 1 for mouse platelets ( arrow ) ( mean ± s . e . m . , n = 3 ) .

Similar to human platelets , maintenance of mouse inte - grin α IIb β 3 adhesive bonds on a fibrinogen matrix is dependent on the cooperative signaling function of integrin α IIb β 3 and released ADP ; how - ever , in the mouse system , the contribution of integrin α IIb β 3 – dependent signaling processes to sustained adhesion is most clearly manifested in the presence of ADP receptor antagonists 25 . This species difference pro - bably reflects differences in the binding kinetics of mouse versus human integrin α IIb β 3 to human fibrinogen . In the presence of ADP receptor antagonists , 71 . 4 ± 3 . 2 % of wild - type mouse platelets maintained stable adhesion contacts with fibrinogen after exposure to rapid increases in shear ( Fig . 1c ) . In contrast , 39 . 8 ± 5 % of wild - type platelets treated with LY294002 and ADP receptor antagonists were able to maintain stable adhesive interactions under the same experimental conditions . As shown in Fig . 1 , analysis of PI3K p110 δ – deficient and PI3K p110 γ – deficient platelets showed no significant difference in shear - resistant platelet adhesion relative to wild - type matched controls ( Fig . 1c , e ) . Similarly , deficiency of PI3K p110 δ and PI3K p110 γ had no signifi - cant effect on integrin α IIb β 3 – dependent cytosolic calcium flux , in the presence or absence of ADP receptor antagonists ( Fig . 1d , f ) , excluding an important role for these isoforms in maintaining integrin α IIb β 3 adhesive contacts under high shear . Development of isoform - selective PI3K p110 β inhibitors Establishing the roles of the PI3K p110 α and p110 β isoforms in sig - naling pathways is complicated by the lack of available mouse models and specific isoform - selective inhibitors . To overcome this problem we developed β isoform – selective PI3K inhibitors based on detailed structure and function analysis of LY294002 ( Fig . 2a ) . Replacing the chromone nucleus with the pyrido [ 1 , 2 - a ] pyrimidin - 4 - one nucleus and elaboration of the pendant aryl ring yielded compounds with increased potency and selectivity against the Type I PI3K p110 β isoform ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . 1 online ) . One of the most potent members of this group ( TGX - 221 ) has an IC 50 of 5 nM against the purified kinase ( phosphatidylinositol as substrate in the presence of 50 µ M ATP ; IC 50 ∼ 10 nM with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 as substrate ) and shows ∼ 1 , 000 - fold selectivity over PI3K p110 α ( Fig . 2c ) . TGX - 221 had minimal inhibitory effect on Type II PI3K C2 α and PI4K and showed > 1 , 000 - fold selectivity for PI3K p110 β over a broad range of protein kinases ( Supplementary Table 1 online ) , and similar to LY294002 , had minimal effect on global protein phosphorylation in thrombin - stimulated platelets ( data not shown ) . Similar to LY294002 , the inhibitory effects of TGX - 221 were influenced by the concentration of ATP . At physiologically relevant cytosolic ATP levels ( typically ≥ 1 , 000 µ M ) the IC 50 against PI3K p110 β increased from 5 nM to ∼ 50 nM , indicating that TGX - 221 was probably acting as a competitive ATP antagonist . Analysis of the effects of TGX - 221 on PI3K lipid product generation in vivo showed that TGX - 221 inhib - ited shear - induced PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 production in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . 1 online ) , without altering the cellular levels of PI ( 3 ) P and the conventional phosphoinositides , PI ( 4 ) P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 2d ) . Increases in PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 levels were not detected under these experimental conditions , presumably as a result of the rapid dephosphorylation of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 by SHIP - 1 ( ref . 26 ) . The IC 50 for inhibiting PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 production in platelets ( ∼ 50 nM ) was ∼ 50 – 100 - fold lower than that observed with LY294002 ( 2 . 5 – 5 µ M ) , which correlated well with the relative IC 50 s for these com - pounds against PI3K p110 β at physiological ATP concentrations . These studies show that TGX - 221 is a potent cell - permeable inhibitor of PI3K p110 β and furthermore , show an important role for PI3K p110 β in promoting shear - dependent PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 generation .

Similarly , PI3K p110 δ – deficient and PI3K p110 γ – deficient mouse plate - lets were equally sensitive to the inhibitory effects of TGX - 221 and LY294002 , defining a major role for PI3K p110 β in promoting integrin α IIb β 3 – dependent calcium flux ( Fig . 3c – f ) . To investigate the importance of PI3K p110 β in initiating the formation of integrin α IIb β 3 adhesive bonds under high shear , flow - based adhesion studies were performed on an immobilized human vWf matrix . TGX - 221 abolished stable plate - let adhesion and thrombus formation on a vWf substrate at elevated shear rates ( 1 , 800 s – 1 ; Fig . 3g , h ) . This reduction in firm platelet adhesion was associated with inhibition of cytosolic calcium flux and integrin α IIb β 3 activation ( data not shown ) . Similarly , shear - induced aggrega - tion of platelets in suspension ( 5 , 000 s – 1 ) was inhibited by TGX - 221 by > 90 % ( data not shown ) . Recent studies have defined an important role for rapid increases in shear ( temporal shear gradients ) in promoting integrin α IIb β 3 – dependent calcium flux , necessary for efficient platelet activation on a vWf matrix 27 . As shown in Figure 4 , TGX - 221 com - pletely eliminated cytosolic calcium flux ( Fig . 4a , c ) and integrin α IIb β 3 activation ( Fig . 4f ) induced by temporal shear gradients ( 0 – 10 , 000 s – 1 ) , confirming a major role for PI3K p110 β in integrin α IIb β 3 mechano - transduction . In control studies , a PI3K p110 δ inhibitor ( D - 010 ( ref . 28 ) ; Supplementary Fig . 2 online ) had no inhibitory effects on platelet activation induced by high shear stress ( data not shown ) or by tem - poral shear gradients ( Supplementary Fig . 2 online ) . Similar find - ings were found with PI3K p110 γ – deficient platelets ( Supplementary Fig . 2 online ) . Furthermore , the effects of TGX - 221 on calcium flux were selective , as it had no inhibitory effect on GPIb - dependent calcium signals ( Fig . 4b ) or on calcium signals induced by a range of physiologi - cal agonists ( Fig . 4d , e and data not shown ) . These studies define a major role for PI3K p110 β in promoting the formation and maintenance of integrin α IIb β 3 adhesive bonds under high shear through regulation of integrin α IIb β 3 – dependent calcium flux . PI3K p110 β involvement in platelet aggregation and secretion To investigate the importance of PI3K p110 β in promoting platelet activation by physiological agonists , we performed platelet aggre - gation and granule release studies . TGX - 221 had no inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation and alpha - and dense - granule release induced by thrombin , high - dose collagen or the TxA 2 analog U46619 ( Fig . 5a – c , Supplementary Fig . 3 online and data not shown ) . Furthermore , TGX - 221 had no inhibitory effect on the ability of these agonists to stimulate integrin α IIb β 3 activation ( as assessed by PAC - 1 binding ; data not shown ) . But inhibition of PI3K 110 β did inhibit sustained platelet aggregation induced by threshold concentrations of thrombin receptor agonist peptide ( TRAP ; Fig . 5c and Supplementary Fig . 3 online ) , collagen ( Supplementary Fig . 3 online ) and U46619 ( data not shown ) , although alpha - and dense - granule release was only marginally affected by this inhibitor ( Fig . 5a , b ) . These studies show that PI3K p110 β has an important role in sustaining platelet aggregation in response to weak agonist stimulation . Platelet aggregation induced by threshold concentrations of agonists is partially dependent on the granule release of ADP 29 . TGX - 221 inhibited ADP - induced platelet aggregation over a dose range consistent with the inhibition of PI3K p110 β . The inhibitory effects of TGX - 221 were apparent over a broad range of ADP concentrations and were primarily manifested as an inability of ADP to sustain platelet aggregation ( Fig . 5d , e ) . Inhibition of PI3K p110 β had no effect on the ability of ADP to stimulate P2Y 1 - dependent cytosolic calcium flux ( Fig . 5f and Supplementary Fig . 4 online ) or platelet shape change ( Supplementary Fig . 4 online ) , suggesting a potentially important role for PI3K p110 β in P2Y 12 signaling . Consistent with this , TGX - 221 inhibited P2Y 12 / G i - dependent potentiation of platelet aggregation induced by threshold concentrations of other agonists ( Fig . 5g ) . Similar findings were apparent when the G i - linked α 2Α adrenergic receptor agonist epinephrine was used to potentiate platelet aggregation ( Fig . 5g ) , suggesting an important role for PI3K p110 β in platelet G i signaling processes . Consistent with this , G i - dependent Rap1b activation , a Ras family GTPase that potentiates integrin α IIb β 3 activation 30 was inhibited by > 70 % by TGX - 221 ( Fig . 5h ) . These studies define an important role for PI3K p110 β in P2Y 12 / G i signaling processes linked to sustained platelet aggregation . Antithrombotic effect of PI3K p110 β inhibitors To investigate the antithrombotic potential of TGX - 221 in vivo , a modi - fied ‘Folts - type’ thrombosis model was used in anesthetized rats and rabbits 31 .

The effects of TGX - 221 in these models was selective , as a pharmacological PI3K p110 δ inhibitor ( D - 010 ) had no effect on arterial thrombotic occlusion ( Fig . 6a ) . The onset of the antithrombotic effect of TGX - 221 was rapid ( occurring within 5 min of bolus injection ; Supplementary Fig . 6 online ) and dose dependent , with activity observed at doses as low as 0 . 5 mg / kg . In a separate rat carotid artery electrolytic injury model 32 , TGX - 221 ( 2 mg / kg ) prevented the development of occlusive thrombi ( Fig . 6b , n = 6 ) and was more effective than aspirin at preserving carotid blood flow volume over the 60 - min period after injury ( Fig . 6b , c ) . TGX - 221 had no effect on baseline arterial blood pressure , heart rate or blood flow in the uninjured carotid artery in both the Folts and electrolytic studies ( data not shown ) . Analysis of a range of structural analogs of TGX - 221 with varying inhibitory poten - cies against PI3K p110 β showed a strong rank - order correlation between their inhibitory effects on the purified kinase with their ability to inhibit shear activation of platelets in vitro and occlusive thrombus formation in vivo ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , analysis of the circulating concen - trations of TGX - 221 in rats confirmed that the antithrombotic activity of this compound occurred at serum levels relevant to inhibition of PI3K p110 β in platelets ( serum concentration of 2 and 0 . 2 µ M at 5 and 60 min after intravenous infusion of TGX - 221 , respectively ) . In further control studies , LY294002 ( 5 – 10 mg / kg ) and wortmannin ( 1 mg / kg ) , both non - isoform - selective PI3K inhibitors , also prevented arterial thrombotic occlusion in the rat Folts - type and electrolytic preparations , although LY294002 was 10 – 20 - fold less potent than TGX - 221 ( Fig . 6a and data not shown ) . PI3K p110 β seemed to be the major PI3K isoform pro - moting occlusive thrombus formation as mice deficient in PI3K p110 γ showed normal arterial occlusion in several distinct arterial thrombosis models ( Fig . 6a and Supplementary Fig . 5 online ) . Analysis of the effects of TGX - 221 on bleeding time showed that doses as high as 20 mg / kg ( 40 times the minimal effective antithrombotic dose ) did not prolong the rat tail bleeding time ( Fig . 6d ) . Similarly , TGX - 221 did not affect ear bleeding time in anesthetized rabbits ( data not shown ) . Notably , coadministration of TGX - 221 with the anticoagulant heparin ( 100 U / kg intravenous ) also had no significant effect on bleed - ing time ( Fig . 6d ) . This contrasted with other antiplatelet agents , such as aspirin and clopidogrel , which alone increased the rat tail bleeding time and in combination with heparin resulted in a bleeding time greater than 20 min ( Fig . 6d ) . DISCUSSION The studies presented here have defined a key role for the Type IA p110 β isoform of PI3K in initiating and sustaining integrin α IIb β 3 adhesion contacts , particularly under conditions of high shear stress . Shear - induced platelet activation requires the cooperative adhesive and signaling function of GPIb and integrin α IIb β 3 in concert with amplifi - cation signals linked to the G i - coupled purinergic receptor , P2Y 1233 , 34 . We have shown that PI3K p110 β is involved in G i - dependent signaling processes linked to the activation of Rap1b , a Ras family GTPase that has a well - defined role in regulating integrin adhesive function 35 . Thus , PI3K p110 β has an important role in sustaining integrin α IIb β 3 activation and stable platelet aggregation by regulating both integrin α IIb β 3 – dependent calcium flux and G i - activation of Rap1b ( Fig . 6e ) . These findings pro - vide a mechanistic explanation as to why PI3K p110 β inhibitors reduce platelet adhesion and aggregation under high shear and prevent arterial thrombotic occlusion in vivo . By exploiting the unique structural features of PI3K 36 , 37 we have devel - oped potent isoform - selective inhibitors against PI3K p110 β . A crucial determinant of LY294002 specificity is the 8 - phenyl group , which occu - pies a relatively open pocket that interacts with the ribose moiety of ATP . The active site of PI3K is more open at this position than in protein kinases , explaining the specificity of LY294002 toward lipid kinases . We have shown here that elaboration of the pendant aryl ring yields com - pounds with increased potency and selectivity against PI3K p110 β , with a b c d e f g h Figure 5 Role of PI3K p110 β in regulating platelet activation induced by physiological agonists .

We have confirmed that p110 δ is minimally expressed in platelets 18 , 20 and studies using phar - macological p110 δ inhibitors and p110 δ - deficient mouse platelets do not support a substantial role for this isoform in platelet function ( data shown here and S . M . Schoenwaelder & S . P . Jackson , unpublished observations ) . Thus , utilizing TGX - 221 at submicromolar concentra - tions , we have shown that the only functionally relevant platelet PI3K that is markedly inhibited by this compound is PI3K p110 β . Several lines of evidence suggest that the antithrombotic activity of TGX - 221 observed in our animal models is probably the result of inhibition of PI3K p110 β . First , analysis of the circulating concentrations of TGX - 221 in rats confirmed that the antithrombotic activity of this com - pound occurred at serum levels relevant to inhibition of PI3K p110 β in platelets . Second , utilizing a series of structural analogs of TGX - 221 , we have shown a close rank - order correlation between the inhibition of PI3K p110 β and the antithrombotic activity of these compounds in vivo . Third , direct comparison of the dose responses of LY294002 and TGX - 221 showed that the latter compound was 10 – 20 - fold more potent than the former at preventing arterial thrombotic occlusion in vivo . In contrast , the pharmacological inhibitor against PI3K p110 δ , which has ∼ 20 - fold higher potency against the δ isoform than LY294002 , showed considerably less potency in in vivo models . This combined with the demonstration of a normal thrombotic response in PI3K p110 γ – deficient mice provides strong experimental evidence that the major antithrombotic effect of LY294002 and TGX - 221 is primarily through inhibition of PI3K p110 β . A notable finding in this study is the demonstration that PI3K p110 β inhibitors have no effect on bleeding time , even when admin - istered at concentrations 40 - fold higher than the minimal effective antithrombotic dose or when coadministered with an anticoagulant agent such as heparin . This is presumably a reflection of the fact that PI3K p110 β is not essential for initial platelet aggregation and gran - ule release induced by physiological agonists but is important for sustained integrin α IIb β 3 activation necessary for arterial thrombotic occlusion . These findings suggest that PI3K p110 β represents a poten - tially important new target for antithrombotic therapy . Given the ubiquitous expression of PI3K p110 β , the challenge ahead will be to develop strategies to abolish PI3K p110 β activation in platelets while minimizing potential systemic toxicities , particularly if long - term Figure 6 Antithrombotic activity of TGX - 221 . ( a ) The effect of PI3K inhibitors on CFRs in the Folts - type stenosis injury models of arterial thrombosis . The effects of an intravenous bolus of vehicle ( propylene glycol 0 . 25 ml / kg ; n = 10 ) , LY294002 ( LY , 5 mg / kg ; n = 6 ) , D - 010 ( 5 mg / kg ; n = 6 ) or TGX - 221 ( 221 , 2 mg / kg ; n = 8 ) on the average number of CFRs in the rat , or PI3K p110 γ – deficient ( γ – ) mice were examined . Gray bars represent the number of CFRs per 10 min before drug administration and black bars represent the number of CFRs per 10 min after drug administration ( * * * P < 0 . 0001 , paired Student t - test ) .

( e ) Schematic model showing the central role of PI3K p110 β in sustaining integrin α IIb β 3 adhesive bonds necessary for shear - resistant platelet adhesion . Integrin α IIb β 3 engagement of adhesive ligands ( vWf - fibrinogen ) induces outside - in signals linked to the mobilization of cytosolic calcium flux . These calcium signals positively feed back on the integrin itself , strengthening the affinity and avidity of the adhesive interaction 21 , 25 . Released ADP potentiates integrin α IIb β 3 activation through P2Y 12 - mediated activation of Rap1b , promoting shear - resistant platelet adhesion . PI3K p110 β has a central role in this process by promoting integrin α IIb β 3 - dependent calcium flux ( solid lines in 1 ) and G i - dependent activation of Rap1b ( dotted lines in 2 ) . This molecular mechanism is also probably responsible for the sustained aggregation of platelets induced by ADP or threshold concentrations of other agonists .

Such strategies have previously been used successfully against other ubiquitous targets ; the most notable involves irreversible acetylation of cyclo - oxygenases by aspirin . Overall , our findings provide further evidence for functional specialization of different PI3K isoforms and show for the first time an important role for PI3K p110 β in platelet function and thrombosis . Given the important roles of each of the Type I PI3K family members in various pathophysiological processes ( PI3K p110 α in oncogenesis , PI3K p110 β in thrombosis , PI3K p110 δ in immune function and PI3K p110 γ in inflam - mation 38 – 40 ) isoform - selective PI3K inhibitors may ultimately have con - siderable therapeutic benefit in a wide range of human diseases . METHODS Materials and knockout mice . All materials were obtained from sources described elsewhere 21 , 26 , 41 . The synthesis of TGX - 221 and other compounds used in this study have been described 42 or will be reported in detail elsewhere . PI3K p110 γ – deficient mice were generated by D . Wu ( University of Rochester , New York ) . PI3K p110 δ – deficient mice were provided by M . Turner ( Babraham Institute , UK ) . All protocols involving the use of animals were approved by the Alfred Medical Research Education Precinct Animal Ethics Committee , Alfred Medical Research Education Precinct , Victoria , Australia . Platelet preparation and aggregation . Preparation of human and mouse washed platelets , platelet - rich plasma ( PRP ) , and performance of platelet aggregations using PRP , were all performed as described previously 21 , 26 , 41 . We obtained informed consent from all human subjects donating blood . All pro - cedures involving collection of blood from human subjects were approved by the Monash University Standing Committee on Ethics in Research Involving Humans , Monash University , Victoria , Australia . Flow cytometry . We measured surface expression of P - selectin using a P - selectin - specific monoclonal antibody ( AK6 , 1 µ g / ml ) , and analyzed it on a FACScalibur ( Becton Dickinson ) . Serotonin release . Dense granule release was measured in 14 C - serotonin labeled platelets as reported previously 43 . Measurement of intracellular calcium mobilization . Calcium mobilization in resting and ADP - stimulated washed platelets ( 200 × 10 9 / L ) loaded with Fura - 2 AM ( 5 µ M ) was monitored over time using a fluorimeter ( LS - 50B ; Supplementary Methods online ) . We performed measurements in the absence or presence of the indicated inhibitors ( TGX - 221 , 0 . 5 µ M ; A3P5PS , 300 µ M ) , with dual excitation at 340 and 380 nm and detected emission at 510 nm . Calcium measurements were converted to nM calcium using computer - assisted analysis ( FL WinLAB ) . Measurement of active Rap1b . The level of GTP - bound Rap1b in human platelet lysates was measured by selective precipitation of GTP - bound Rap1b using GST - RalGDS bound to glutathione - Sepharose , as described previously 44 , 45 . In vitro flow studies . Flow - based assays using whole blood or washed plate - lets were performed as described previously 41 . Analysis of platelet adhesion and cytosolic calcium flux on a fibrinogen matrix under flow conditions were moni - tored according to published methods 21 , 25 , 41 , and details are in Supplementary Methods online . Studies examining adhesion strength at high shear , along with temporal shear gradient experiments , were performed as described in Supplementary Methods online . Measurement of thrombus formation on a vWf matrix at 1 , 800 s – 1 was performed and analyzed as described previously 12 . PI3K lipid kinase assay . Kinase assays were performed according to a previously described method 46 . Measurement of 32 P lipids in platelets . We applied 32 P - loaded washed human platelets to a cone - and - plate viscometer and subjected them to a shear rate of 6 , 000 s – 1 for a period of 2 – 5 min . The levels of PI ( 4 ) P , PI ( 3 ) P , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 in platelets was measured as described previously 26 . In vivo thrombosis models . We performed a Folts - type stenosis injury model 31 and an electrolytic model 32 ( Supplementary Methods online ) on rats , rabbits and mice . Tail bleeding studies in rats . Tail bleeding time was measured in anesthetized rats ( halothane in O 2 ) 15 min before and 5 and 30 min after drug administration . We administered the following drug concentrations : TGX - 221 ( 2 mg / kg intra - venous ) , aspirin ( 200 mg / kg orally ) , clopidogrel ( 10 mg / kg orally ) and heparin ( 100 U / kg intravenous ) . We administered clopidogrel orally 25 h before tail bleeding . Aspirin was administered twice orally : the first dose 25 h before the experiment and the second dose 1 h before the start of the experiment . For experi - ments involving pretreatment with aspirin or clopidogrel or both , tail bleeding time was also measured before the first gavage dose at 25 h before tail bleeding . Incisions 5 mm long and 1 mm deep 47 were made in the tail at each time point and bleeding was monitored by blotting with filter paper 48 every 30 sec until it had ceased ( tail bleeding time ) . Statistical analysis . All individual aggregation traces , calcium traces , and images were taken from one experiment representative of at least three independent experiments . All numerical results are presented as mean ± s . e . m . The significance between two data tests was tested using unpaired t - tests in most instances , unless otherwise indicated . Statistical significance was considered when P < 0 . 05 . Note : Supplementary information is available on the Nature Medicine website . AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Alan D . Robertson and Hatem H .
