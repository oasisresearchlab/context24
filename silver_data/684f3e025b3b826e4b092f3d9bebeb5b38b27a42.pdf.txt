Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems Ekaterina Shutova ∗ University of California , Berkeley System design and evaluation methodologies receive signiﬁcant attention in natural language processing ( NLP ) , with the systems typically being evaluated on a common task and against shared data sets . This enables direct system comparison and facilitates progress in the ﬁeld . However , computational work on metaphor is considerably more fragmented than similar re - search efforts in other areas of NLP and semantics . Recent years have seen a growing interest in computational modeling of metaphor , with many new statistical techniques opening routes for improving system accuracy and robustness . However , the lack of a common task deﬁnition , shared data set , and evaluation strategy makes the methods hard to compare , and thus hampers our progress as a community in this area . The goal of this article is to review the system features and evaluation strategies that have been proposed for the metaphor processing task , and to analyze their beneﬁts and downsides , with the aim of identifying the desired properties of metaphor processing systems and a set of requirements for their evaluation . 1 . Introduction Metaphor enriches our communication with a more diverse imagery and provides an important mechanism for reasoning about concepts . At the same time , it is also a very common linguistic device that has long become a part of our everyday language . Meta - phors arise through systematic associations between distinct , and seemingly unrelated , concepts . For example , when we say “The wheels of Stalin’s regime were well - oiled and already turning , ” we view a political system in terms of a mechanism , it can function , break , have wheels , and so forth . The existence of this association allows us to transfer knowledge and inferences from the domain of mechanisms to that of political systems . As a result , we reason about political systems in terms of mechanisms and discuss them using the mechanism terminology , giving rise to a variety of metaphorical expressions . This view of metaphor is widely known as Conceptual Metaphor Theory ( CMT ) . It was proposed by Lakoff and Johnson ( 1980 ) , who claimed that metaphor is not merely a property of language , but rather a cognitive mechanism that structures our conceptual system in a certain way . Lakoff and Johnson explained metaphor through a presence of a mapping between two domains of experience : the target ( e . g . , politics ) and the source ( e . g . , mechanism ) . Metaphor is thus not limited to meaning extensions of individual ∗ International Computer Science Institute , 1947 Center St . Ste . 600 , Berkeley , CA 94704 , USA .

Let us consider a few more examples . ( 1 ) “President Obama is rebuilding the campaign machinery that vaulted him into ofﬁce” ( New York Times 2011 ) ( 2 ) 20 steps towards a modern , working democracy ( 3 ) Time to mend our foreign policy . ( 4 ) “She knows the nuts and bolts , and it’s not the nuts and bolts inside legislation , it’s the nuts and bolts of raising money , preparing the party for elections , a political consultant kind of politics . ” ( Bzdek 2008 ) These examples demonstrate how multiple properties and inferences from the domain of mechanisms are systematically projected onto our knowledge about politics . Lakoff and Johnson coined the term conceptual metaphor to describe such mappings from the source domain to the target . The view of an inter - conceptual mapping as a ba - sis of metaphor was echoed by other prominent theories in the ﬁeld . These include , most notably , the comparison view , formulated in the Structure – Mapping Theory of Gentner ( 1983 ) , and the interaction view ( Black 1962 ; Hesse 1966 ) . However , the prin - ciples of CMT have inspired and inﬂuenced much of the computational work on metaphor , thus becoming more central to this paper . Conceptual metaphor manifests itself in language in the form of linguistic metaphor , or metaphorical expressions . These in turn include lexical metaphor , that is , single - word meaning extensions ( as in Examples ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) ; multi - word metaphorical expressions ( e . g . , “the government turned a blind eye to corruption” ) ; or extended metaphor , that spans longer discourse fragments . Manifestations of metaphor are frequent in language , appearing on average in every third sentence of general - domain text , according to corpus studies ( Cameron 2003 ; Martin 2006 ; Shutova and Teufel 2010 ; Steen et al . 2010 ) . This makes metaphor an important subject of linguistic research and makes its accurate processing essential for a range of practical NLP applications . These include , for example , ( 1 ) machine trans - lation ( MT ) : Because a large number of metaphorical expressions are culture - speciﬁc , they represent a considerable challenge for MT ( e . g . , the English metaphor “to shoot down someone’s arguments” cannot be literally translated into German as “Argumente abschießen ” and metaphor interpretation is required ) ; ( 2 ) opinion mining : Metaphorical expressions tend to contain a strong emotional component—for example , compare the metaphorical expression “Government loosened stranglehold on business” and its literal counterpart Government deregulated business ( Narayanan 1999 ) ; ( 3 ) information retrieval ( IR ) : Non - literal language without appropriate disambiguation may lead to false positives in information retrieval ( e . g . , documents describing “ old school gentle - men” should not be returned for the query school [ Korkontzelos et al . 2013 ] ) ; and many others . Because metaphor interpretation requires complex analogical comparisons and the projection of inference structures across domains , the task of automatic metaphor processing is challenging . For many years , computational work on metaphor evolved around the use of hand - coded knowledge and rules to model metaphorical associa - tions , making the systems hard to scale . Recent years have seen a growing interest in statistical modeling of metaphor ( Mason 2004 ; Gedigian et al . 2006 ; Shutova 2010 ; Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen 2010 ; Turney et al . 2011 ; Dunn 2013a ; Heintz et al . 2013 ; Hovy et al . 2013 ; Li , Zhu , and Wang 2013 ; Mohler et al . 2013 ; Shutova and Sun 2013 ; 580 Shutova Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems Strzalkowski et al . 2013 ; Tsvetkov , Mukomel , and Gershman 2013 ) , with many new techniques opening routes for improving system accuracy and robustness . A wide range of methods have been proposed and investigated by the community , including supervised ( Gedigian et al . 2006 ; Dunn 2013a ; Hovy et al . 2013 ; Mohler et al . 2013 ; Tsvetkov , Mukomel , and Gershman 2013 ) and unsupervised ( Heintz et al . 2013 ; Shutova and Sun 2013 ) learning , distributional approaches ( Shutova 2010 , 2013 ; Shutova , Van de Cruys , and Korhonen 2012 ) , lexical resource - based methods ( Krishnakumaran and Zhu 2007 ; Wilks et al . 2013 ) , psycholinguistic features ( Turney et al . 2011 ; Gandy et al . 2013 ; Neuman et al . 2013 ; Strzalkowski et al . 2013 ) , and Web search ( Veale and Hao 2008 ; Bollegala and Shutova 2013 ; Li , Zhu , and Wang 2013 ) . Although individual approaches tackling individual aspects of metaphor have met with success , the insights gained from these experiments are still difﬁcult to integrate into a single computational metaphor modeling landscape , because of the lack of a uniﬁed task deﬁnition , a shared data set , and well - deﬁned evaluation standards . This hampers our progress as a community in this area . In this paper we take a step towards closing this gap : We review the recent work on computational modeling of metaphor , the tasks addressed , the system features proposed , and the evaluations conducted , and analyze the relevance of differ - ent linguistic aspects of metaphor for system performance and applicability , with the aim of identifying the desired properties of metaphor processing systems and a set of requirements for their evaluation . 2 . Considerations in the Design of a Metaphor Processing System When designing a metaphor processing system , one faces a number of choices . Some stem from the linguistic and cognitive properties of metaphor , others concern the ap - plicability and usefulness of the system in the wider NLP context . In this section , we analyze individual aspects of metaphor and their relevance to computational modeling , as well as their interplay in the design of a real - world system . 2 . 1 Linguistic Considerations and Levels of Analysis Linguistic considerations that inform the design of metaphor processing systems con - cern primarily the choice of the level ( or levels ) of analysis . The levels of metaphor analysis include ( 1 ) linguistic metaphor ( or metaphorical expressions ) , ( 2 ) conceptual metaphor , ( 3 ) extended metaphor , and ( 4 ) metaphorical inference . Let us consider an example of manifestations of the conceptual metaphor E UROPEAN INTEGRATION as a TRAIN JOURNEY , popular in the early 1990s , at various levels . (cid:114) Conceptual : E UROPEAN INTEGRATION as a TRAIN JOURNEY (cid:114) Linguistic : The coupling of the carriages may not be reliably secure , but the pan - European express is in motion . (cid:114) Extended metaphor : “There is a fear that the European train will thunder forward , laden with its customary cargo of gravy , towards a destination neither wished for nor understood by electorates . But the train can be stopped . ” ( Margaret Thatcher , Sunday Times , 20 Sept 1992 ) (cid:114) Metaphorical inference : The fact that expensive tracks have to be laid for the train to move forward means that someone has to fund the process of European integration . 581 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 2 . 1 . 1 Linguistic metaphor . Linguistic metaphor , or metaphorical expressions , concern the surface realization of metaphorical mechanisms , and have been unsurprisingly cen - tral to metaphor processing research to date ( Birke and Sarkar 2006 ; Gedigian et al . 2006 ; Krishnakumaran and Zhu 2007 ; Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen 2010 ; Turney et al . 2011 ; Dunn 2013a ; Gandy et al . 2013 ; Heintz et al . 2013 ; Hovy et al . 2013 ; Neuman et al . 2013 ; Shutova 2013 ; Strzalkowski et al . 2013 ; Tsvetkov , Mukomel , and Gershman 2013 ) . Metaphorical expressions represent the way in which text - processing systems encounter metaphor , and there is little doubt that any real - world metaphor processing system , whatever the approach or the application , ultimately needs to be able to identify and interpret them . When focusing on linguistic metaphor , one needs to further take into account the level of conventionality of the expressions ; how different syntactic constructions are used to convey metaphorical meanings and at what level metaphor annotation needs to be done ( word , relation , or sentence level ) . Thus the following considerations become important for the task and system design : (cid:114) Level of conventionality of the metaphors accepted : Metaphor is a productive phenomenon , that is , its novel examples continue to emerge in language . However , a large number of metaphorical expressions become conventionalized over time ( e . g . , “I cannot grasp his way of thinking” ) . Although metaphorical in nature , their meanings are deeply entrenched in everyday use , and their comprehension is likened to that of literally used terms ( Nunberg 1987 ) . According to Gibbs ( 1984 ) , metaphorical expressions are spread along a continuum from highly conventional , lexicalized metaphors to entirely novel and creative ones . Gibbs thus suggests that there is no clear demarcation line between literal and metaphorical language , and the distinction between them is rather governed by the level of conventionality of metaphorical expressions . From the usage perspective , metaphoricity may be viewed as a gradient phenomenon rather than a binary one ( Dunn 2011 ) , and conventionality becomes an important factor in the design and evaluation of metaphor processing systems . It is not yet clear where on the metaphorical – literal continuum the system should draw the line between what it considers metaphorical and what it considers literal . The answer to this question most likely depends on the NLP application in mind . However , generally speaking , real - world NLP applications are unlikely to be concerned with historical aspects of metaphor , but rather with the identiﬁcation of ﬁgurative language that needs to be interpreted differently from the literal language . We therefore suggest that NLP applications do not necessarily need to address highly conventional and lexicalized metaphors that can be interpreted using standard word sense disambiguation techniques , but rather would beneﬁt from the identiﬁcation of less conventional and more creative language . Much of the metaphor processing work has focused on conventional metaphor , though in principle capable of identifying novel metaphor as well ( Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen 2010 ; Turney et al . 2011 ; Dunn 2013a ; Gandy et al . 2013 ; Heintz et al . 2013 ; Neuman et al . 2013 ; Shutova 2013 ; Strzalkowski et al . 2013 ; Tsvetkov , Mukomel , and Gershman 2013 ) , with few approaches modeling only novel metaphor ( Desalle , Gaume , and Duvignau 2009 ) or discriminating between conventional and novel metaphors ( Krishnakumaran and Zhu 2007 ) . Other approaches have 582 Shutova Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems looked at literal versus non - literal distinction deﬁned more broadly ( Birke and Sarkar 2006 ; Li and Sporleder 2009 , 2010 ) . (cid:114) Syntactic constructions covered : Metaphors vary with respect to how they are expressed in language grammatically . The grammatical structure of metaphorical expressions is tightly coupled with the inference processes that produce them and are guided by the semantic frames they evoke ( Sullivan 2007 , 2013 ) . According to Sullivan , conceptual metaphors are realized in language via mapping semantic roles in the source frame onto roles in the target frame . This suggests that both the source and the target domain impose a set of constraints on the roles that can be mapped , and thus on the syntactic options for expressing the metaphorical meaning . There has not yet been a computational approach investigating the interplay of frame semantics and surface structure of metaphorical language . However , the community has addressed modeling linguistic metaphor in a range of syntactic constructions . Verbal or adjectival metaphors are particularly widely embraced by NLP researchers ( most approaches ) , with a few works focusing on copula constructions ( Krishnakumaran and Zhu 2007 ; Gandy et al . 2013 ; Li , Zhu , and Wang 2013 ; Neuman et al . 2013 ) or other nominal metaphors ( Heintz et al . 2013 ; Hovy et al . 2013 ; Li , Zhu , and Wang 2013 ; Mohler et al . 2013 ; Strzalkowski et al . 2013 ) . A number of approaches to metaphor identiﬁcation have also addressed multiword metaphors ( Li and Sporleder 2010 ; Heintz et al . 2013 ; Hovy et al . 2013 ; Mohler et al . 2013 ) . Corpus - linguistic research has shown that verbs and adjectives account for a large proportion of metaphorical expressions observed in the data ( Cameron 2003 ; Shutova and Teufel 2010 ) . However , a recent study ( Jamrozik et al . 2013 ) has also shown that relational words tend to have a higher metaphorical potential . This corresponds to the data on verbal metaphor frequency , and it also suggests that relational nouns are important ( e . g . , “words are friends of translators” ) . (cid:114) Lexical , relation , or sentence level : Finally , one needs to decide if metaphor should be annotated at the word level ( i . e . , tagging the source domain words alone ) , relation level ( i . e . , tagging both source and target words in a particular grammatical relation ) , or sentence level ( i . e . , tagging sentences that contain metaphorical language , without explicit annotation of source and target domain words ) . The word or relation levels provide the most information and have been the focus of the majority of approaches ( Gedigian et al . 2006 ; Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen 2010 ; Turney et al . 2011 ; Gandy et al . 2013 ; Heintz et al . 2013 ; Hovy et al . 2013 ; Neuman et al . 2013 ; Shutova 2013 ; Shutova and Sun 2013 ; Wilks et al . 2013 ) . However , some works annotated metaphor at the sentence level ( Krishnakumaran and Zhu 2007 ; Dunn 2013a ; Li , Zhu , and Wang 2013 ; Mohler et al . 2013 ; Strzalkowski et al . 2013 ; Tsvetkov , Mukomel , and Gershman 2013 ) . 2 . 1 . 2 Conceptual metaphor . Conceptual metaphor represents a cognitive and conceptual mechanism by which humans produce and comprehend metaphorical expressions . Manifestations of conceptual metaphor are ubiquitous in language , communication , and even decision - making ( Thibodeau and Boroditsky 2011 ) . Here are a few examples of 583 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 common metaphorical mappings : TIME is MONEY ( e . g . , “That ﬂat tire cost me an hour” ) , IDEAS are PHYSICAL OBJECTS ( e . g . , “I cannot grasp his way of thinking” ) , EMOTIONS ARE VEHICLES ( e . g . , “she was transported with pleasure” ) , FEELINGS ARE LIQUIDS ( e . g . , “all of this stirred an unfathomable excitement in her” ) , LIFE IS A JOURNEY ( e . g . , “He arrived at the end of his life with very little emotional baggage ” ) ; ARGUMENT IS A WAR ( e . g . , “He shot down all of my arguments , ” “He attacked every weak point in my argument” ) . On one hand , few would disagree that the metaphor processing systems capable of understanding and applying conceptual metaphor should be in a better position to accurately handle linguistic metaphors as well . However , a series of questions arise when designing a model of conceptual metaphor . For example , how does one represent conceptual metaphors in the system ? What labels does one assign to source and target domains ? Is it even possible to name all the conceptual metaphors that humans use and is it necessary to do so ? A computational model needs a clear deﬁnition of what constitutes the source and target domains ( whether they are manually listed or automat - ically learned ) and the consistency and coverage of source and target domain categories would play a crucial role in how well the model can account for real - world data . Previous research on annotation of conceptual metaphor ( Shutova and Teufel 2010 ) has shown that the annotators tend to disagree on the assignment of source and target domain categories . The most variation stems from the level of generality of the selected categories , indicating that while cross - domain mappings are intuitive to humans ( i . e . , they can be annotated in arbitrary text in principle ) , labeling source and target domains consistently appears to be a challenging task . What this suggests is that , although the mechanism of conceptual metaphor may be helpful to the system , the question of how to best represent source and target domains within the system remains open . A predeﬁned set of categories , such as those widely discussed in the linguistic literature on CMT , may not be sufﬁcient or even suitable for a computational model . And despite the validity of the main principles of CMT as a linguistic theory , it is not straightforward to port it to computational modeling of metaphor . A more ﬂexible , and potentially data - driven , representation of source and target domain categories is needed for the latter purpose . A data - driven representation would also be better suited to account for the freedom of interpretation that some metaphors allow , since more ﬂexible structures can be dynamically learned from the data . So far , the community has attempted assigning manually created labels to metaphorical mappings ( Mason 2004 ; Baumer , Tomlinson , and Richland 2009 ) , harvesting ﬁne - grained mappings between individual nouns ( Li , Zhu , and Wang 2013 ) , using lexical resources to deﬁne or expand source and target domain categories ( Gandy et al . 2013 ; Mohler et al . 2013 ) , representing source and target concepts as word clusters ( Shutova and Sun 2013 ) or automatically learned topics ( Heintz et al . 2013 ) , and learning metaphorical mappings implicitly within the model without explicit labeling ( Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen 2010 ) . 2 . 1 . 3 Extended metaphor . Extended metaphor refers to the use of metaphor at the dis - course level . It manifests itself in discourse via a sequence of metaphorically used lan - guage , yielded by the same conceptual metaphor , whereby a continuous scenario from the source domain is metaphorically projected onto the target . For instance , viewing European integration as a train journey led to numerous metaphorical expressions in political discourse . Each of them mapped certain properties of train journeys to political processes—with countries as loosely connected carriages , peoples of different countries as passengers of their respective carriages , expensive tracks that have to be laid for the train to move forward , and the ﬁnal destination not very well understood . This metaphor has been dominating the debate , with the European leaders arguing over its details 584 Shutova Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems ( Beigman Klebanov and Beigman 2010 ) . One can see this metaphor frequently reappear and evolve over time , helping politicians defend their agendas and , not least , shedding some clarity on an otherwise uncertain future . Research in linguistics and political science ( Musolff 2000 ; Lakoff 2008 ; Lakoff and Wehling 2012 ) suggests that the use of a particular metaphor often guides the speak - ers’ argumentation strategy throughout a piece of discourse , as well as participants’ behavior in a dialogue . Beigman Klebanov and Beigman ( 2010 ) investigated extended metaphor within a game - theoretic framework , demonstrating that maintaining the metaphorical frame in a debate is rationalizable in terms of the gains the participants may get from doing so and their potential losses from swerving away from the meta - phor . Their approach reverse - engineers the motivations behind the use of extended metaphor within a formal framework . Beigman Klebanov and Beigman’s work was an important advance , enhancing our understanding of the inner workings of extended metaphor , motivation behind its use , and its effects on social dynamics . However , a computational method for identiﬁcation and interpretation of extended metaphor in real - world discourse is yet to be proposed . A discourse - level metaphor processing system would need to identify a chain of metaphorical expressions in a text , which in - dicates a systematic association of the text topic with a particular domain . These chains would then demonstrate how continuous scenarios can be transferred across domains . Recovering this information from the data would allow us to better understand the structure behind metaphorical associations , as well as the inferential process by which knowledge is projected across domains . This system would also ﬁnd application in social science , where metaphorical framing is widely studied as an indicator of the underlying cultural and moral models ( Lakoff and Wehling 2012 ) . 2 . 1 . 4 Metaphorical inference . When projecting knowledge from one domain to another , a set of complex inferences take place . Metaphorical inferences are grounded in the source domain and result in the production of surface structures we observe in language as metaphorical expressions . Metaphorical mappings are thus realized via project - ing inference structures from the source domain onto the target . For example , when European integration is metaphorically viewed as a train journey , our knowledge of typical events and their consequences from the domain of train journey are projected onto our reasoning about the process of European integration . For instance , if we know that expensive tracks need to be laid before a train can move forward , we can infer that someone also needs to fund the process of European integration . Interestingly , in the presence of a conceptual metaphor such inference can take place even without any linguistic metaphor referring to the tracks being present , but rather on the basis of our common sense knowledge about the functioning of trains . Besides allowing us to derive new information about the target domain , projecting the inferential structures from the source domain also invokes an emotional response coming from the source domain—for example , an unknown destination or a great expense make one feel uneasy when referred to both literally and metaphorically . Such a transfer of inferential processes and emotional content is believed by some to be one of the central purposes of metaphor ( Kovecses 2005 ; Feldman 2006 ; Thibodeau and Boroditsky 2011 ) . Psychologists Thibodeau and Boroditsky ( 2011 ) investigated how metaphor and metaphorical inference affect decision - making . Their hypothesis was that metaphors in language “instantiate frame - consistent knowledge structures [ from the source domain ] and invite structurally consistent inferences [ about the target domain ] . ” They used two groups of subjects , who were presented with two different texts about crime . In the ﬁrst text crime was metaphorically portrayed as a VIRUS and 585 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 in the second as a BEAST . The two groups were then asked a set of questions on how to tackle crime in the city . It turned out that , whereas the ﬁrst group tended to opt for preventive measures in tackling crime ( e . g . , stronger social policies ) , the second group converged on punishment - or restraint - oriented measures . According to Thibodeau and Boroditsky , their results demonstrate that metaphors have profound inﬂuence on how we conceptualize and act with respect to societal issues . Interestingly , the participants would explain their decisions via arguments unrelated to the metaphor , showing that the effect of metaphorical inference in guiding human reasoning is rather covert . Being able to reproduce these inferences is likely to make automatic metaphor un - derstanding better informed and hence more accurate . It may also provide a mechanism of representing source – target domain mappings , that themselves are generalizations over a set of inferences transferred from one domain to another . And ﬁnally , these inferences provide a platform for metaphor interpretation , namely , deriving the mean - ing of a metaphorical expression and the additional connotations it introduces ( that are likely to originate from the source domain ) . There is a consensus among cognitive linguists that it is metaphorical inference that provides for the very texture behind the use of metaphor ( Hobbs 1981 ; Carbonell 1982 ; Rohrer 1997 ; Turner and Fauconnier 2003 ; Feldman 2006 ) . Although uncovering this texture is certainly one of the main objectives of computational metaphor understanding , it is at the same time a very challenging undertaking . Reproducing metaphorical inferences would require the ability to learn vast amounts of world knowledge from the data , as well as performing complex cross - domain comparisons . And despite being a very promising route , it has not yet been attempted in NLP . 2 . 2 Applicability Another set of considerations in the design of metaphor processing systems stems from the needs of real - world NLP . The high frequency of metaphorical language in textual data makes accurate metaphor processing desired for a number of NLP applications . Thus , the format of metaphor understanding that metaphor processing systems provide should ideally be informed by the requirements of external NLP and a number of considerations arise in that respect : (cid:114) Metaphor processing typically involves two tasks : metaphor identiﬁcation ( distinguishing between literal and metaphorical language in text ) and metaphor interpretation ( identifying the intended meaning of the metaphor ) . Both of these provide useful information for language understanding and need to be addressed , either independently or as a single process . (cid:114) A metaphor processing system should provide a representation of metaphor interpretation that can be easily integrated with other NLP systems . This criterion places constraints on how the metaphor processing task should be deﬁned . The most universally applicable metaphor interpretation would be in the text - to - text form . This means that a metaphor processing system would take raw text as input and provide textual output , in which metaphors are interpreted . (cid:114) In order to be useful for real - world NLP , the system needs to be capable of processing real - world data , and thus operate on unrestricted , continuous text . Rather than only dealing with individual carefully selected clear - cut 586 Shutova Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems examples , the system should be fully implemented and tested on free , naturally occurring text . (cid:114) To enable wide applicability , the system needs to be open - domain —that is , operate in all domains , genres , and topics . Therefore , ideally it should not rely on any domain - speciﬁc information or focus on individual types of instances ( e . g . , a limited set of hand - chosen source - target domain mappings ) . (cid:114) To be easily adaptable to new domains , the system should not rely on task - speciﬁc hand - coded knowledge . This means it needs to be either data - driven and be able to automatically acquire the knowledge it needs from text corpora , or rely only on large - scale , general - domain lexical resources ( that are already in existence and do not need to be created in a costly manner ) . However , it would be an advantage if no such resource is required and the system can dynamically induce meanings in context . (cid:114) To be robust , the system needs to be able to deal with metaphors represented by all word classes and syntactic constructions . Many existing models are designed with speciﬁc kinds of metaphorical expressions in mind , for instance nominal metaphors in copula constructions or verbal metaphors in verb – object relations . To be applicable to support real - world NLP applications , these models need to be extended beyond those speciﬁc word classes and syntactic constructions , and be able to process any kind of metaphorical language . When designing a metaphor processing task , methodology , and evaluation strategy , one thus needs to keep these criteria in mind . Although modeling all of the phenomena de - scribed in this section within a single system is by no means a requirement , it is critically important to be aware of all the guises that metaphor may take , both conceptually and empirically . 3 . Metaphor Annotation and Resources 3 . 1 Corpora Metaphor annotation studies have typically focused on one ( or both ) of the following tasks : ( 1 ) identiﬁcation of metaphorical senses in text ( i . e . , distinguishing between literal and non - literal meanings ) , and ( 2 ) assignment of the corresponding source – target domain mappings . The majority of corpus - linguistic studies were concerned with metaphorical expressions and mappings within a limited domain—for example , WAR , BUSINESS , FOOD , or PLANT metaphors ( Santa Ana 1999 ; Izwaini 2003 ; Koller 2004 ; Skorczynska Sznajder and Pique - Angordans 2004 ; Chung , Ahrens , and Huang 2005 ; Hardie et al . 2007 ; Gong , Ahrens , and Huang 2008 ; Lu and Ahrens 2008 ; Low et al . 2010 ) , in a particular genre or type of discourse ( Charteris - Black 2000 ; Cameron 2003 ; Izwaini 2003 ; Koller 2004 ; Skorczynska Sznajder and Pique - Angordans 2004 ; Martin 2006 ; Hardie et al . 2007 ; Lu and Ahrens 2008 ; Beigman Klebanov and Flor 2013 ) , or in individual examples in isolation from wider context ( Wikberg 2006 ; L¨onneker - Rodman 2008 ) . In addition , these approaches often focused on a small predeﬁned set of source and target domains . Another vein of corpus - based research concerned cross - linguistic differences in the use of metaphor , also in a speciﬁc domain—for example , 587 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 ﬁnancial discourse ( Charteris - Black and Ennis 2001 ) , metaphors describing FEELINGS ( Stefanowitsch 2004 ; Diaz - Vera and Caballero 2013 ) , or metaphorical expressions refer - ring to body parts ( Deignan and Potter 2004 ) . Three recent studies are notable in that they moved away from investigating particular domains to a more general study of how metaphor behaves in unrestricted continuous text . Wallington et al . ( 2003 ) , Shutova and Teufel ( 2010 ) , and Steen et al . ( 2010 ) conducted consecutive metaphor annotation in open - domain texts . Wallington et al . ( 2003 ) used two teams of annotators and compared externally prescribed deﬁnitions of metaphor with intuitive internal ones . Team A was asked to annotate “interesting stretches , ” whereby a phrase was considered interesting if ( 1 ) its signiﬁcance in the document was non - physical , ( 2 ) it could have a physical signiﬁcance in another context with a similar syntactic frame , and ( 3 ) this physical signiﬁcance was related to the abstract one . Team B had to annotate phrases according to their own intuitive deﬁnition of metaphor . Apart from metaphorical expressions , the respective source – target domain mappings were also to be annotated . For this latter task , the annotators were given a set of mappings from the Master Metaphor List and were asked to assign the most suitable ones . However , the authors do not report the level of interannotator agreement , nor the coverage of the mappings in the Master Metaphor List on their data . The fact that the method is limited to a set of mappings exempliﬁed in the Master Metaphor List suggests that it may not scale well to real - world data , because the predeﬁned inventory of mappings is unlikely to be sufﬁcient to cover the majority of metaphorical expressions in arbitrary text . Steen and his colleagues ( Pragglejaz Group 2007 ; Steen et al . 2010 ) proposed a metaphor identiﬁcation procedure ( MIP ) . In the framework of this procedure , the sense of every word in the text is considered as a potential metaphor . Every word is then tagged as literal or metaphorical , based on whether is has a “more basic , contemporary meaning” in other contexts than the current one . The summary of their annotation procedure is presented is Figure 1 . In a sense , such annotation can be viewed as a form of word sense disambiguation with an emphasis on metaphoricity . Steen and colleagues ran a reliability study involving near - native speaker annotators ( strongly relying on dictionary deﬁnitions ) and report an interannotator agreement of 0 . 85 in terms of Fleiss’ kappa . MIP laid the basis for the creation of the VU Amsterdam Meta - phor Corpus 1 ( Steen et al . 2010 ) . This corpus is a subset of BNC Baby 2 annotated for linguistic metaphor . Its size is 200 , 000 words and it comprises four genres : news text , academic text , ﬁction , and conversations . The corpus has already found application in computational metaphor processing research ( Dunn 2013b ; Niculae and Yaneva 2013 ) , as well as inspiring metaphor annotation efforts in other languages ( Badryzlova et al . 2013 ) . The study of Shutova and Teufel ( 2010 ) was concerned with annotation of both metaphorical expressions and metaphorical mappings in continuous text . Their anno - tation procedure is based on MIP , modifying and extending it to the identiﬁcation of conceptual metaphors along with the linguistic ones . Following MIP , the annotators were asked to identify the more basic sense of the word , and then label the context in which the word occurs in the basic sense as the source domain , and the current context as the target . They were provided with a list of suggested common source 1 http : / / www . ota . ox . ac . uk / headers / 2541 . xml . 2 BNC Baby is a 4 - million - word subset of the British National Corpus ( BNC ) ( Burnard 2007 ) , comprising four different genres : academic , ﬁction , newspaper , and conversation .

For our purposes , basic meanings tend to be – More concrete [ what they evoke is easier to imagine , see , hear , feel , smell , and taste ] ; – Related to bodily action ; – More precise ( as opposed to vague ) ; – Historically older ; Basic meanings are not necessarily the most frequent meanings of the lexical unit . (cid:114) If the lexical unit has a more basic current contemporary meaning in other contexts than the given context , decide whether the contextual meaning contrasts with the basic meaning but can be understood in comparison with it . 4 .

Shutova and Teufel’s corpus is a subset of the BNC sampling various genres : ﬁction , newspaper / journal articles , essays on politics , international relations and sociology , and radio broadcast ( transcribed speech ) . The size of the corpus is 13 , 642 words , containing 241 metaphorical expressions in total . Table 1 shows the breakdown of metaphors by type , as well as their variation across genres . Shutova and colleagues used the corpus data as a testbed in a number of computational experiments ( Shutova 2010 ; Shutova , Van de Cruys , and Korhonen 2012 ; Shutova 2013 ; Shutova , Teufel , and Korhonen 2013 ) .

The list is a collection of source – target domain mappings ( mainly those related to mind , feelings , and emotions ) with corresponding examples of language use . The mappings in the list are organized in an ontology—for example , the metaphor PURPOSES ARE DESTINATIONS is a special case of a more general metaphor STATES ARE LOCATIONS . The resource has been criticized for the lack of clear structuring principles of the mapping ontology ( L¨onneker - Rodman 2008 ) . However , to date MML is the most comprehensive resource for conceptual metaphor in the linguistic literature , and the examples from the list have been used by computational approaches ( Mason 2004 ; Krishnakumaran and Zhu 2007 ; Li , Zhu , and Wang 2013 ) , both for development and evaluation purposes . The MML also inspired the creation of other resources , including resources in multiple languages that could facilitate cross - linguistic research on metaphor . One such example is the Hamburg Metaphor Database ( L¨onneker 2004 ; Reining and L¨onneker - Rodman 2007 ) , which con - tains examples of metaphorical expressions in German and French . The expressions are mapped to senses from EuroWordNet 3 and annotated with source – target domain mappings taken from the MML . 4 . Metaphor Identiﬁcation Systems Early approaches to metaphor relied on information in handcrafted knowledge bases , followed by metaphor identiﬁcation in and with the help of lexical resources . Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in statistical and machine learning approaches to metaphor identiﬁcation . As the ﬁeld of computational semantics—in particular , ro - bust parsing and lexical acquisition techniques—have progressed to the point where it is possible to accurately acquire lexical , domain , and relational information from corpora , this opened many new avenues for large - scale statistical metaphor identiﬁ - cation . The vast majority of systems identify metaphor at the linguistic level ( Birke and Sarkar 2006 ; Gedigian et al . 2006 ; Krishnakumaran and Zhu 2007 ; Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen 2010 ; Turney et al . 2011 ; Dunn 2013a ; Heintz et al . 2013 ; Hovy et al . 2013 ; Neuman et al . 2013 ; Shutova 2013 ; Strzalkowski et al . 2013 ; Tsvetkov , Mukomel , and Gershman 2013 ) , with very few focusing on the conceptual level ( Mason 2004 ; Baumer , Tomlinson , and Richland 2009 ) or identifying both ( Gandy et al . 2013 ; Li , Zhu , and Wang 2013 ; Shutova and Sun 2013 ) . This section will ﬁrst present compu - tational approaches to linguistic metaphor identiﬁcation , then move on to conceptual metaphor . 4 . 1 Identiﬁcation of Linguistic Metaphors 4 . 1 . 1 Approaches Using Hand - Coded Knowledge and Lexical Resources . One of the ﬁrst approaches to identify and interpret metaphorical expressions in text was proposed by Fass ( 1991 ) in his met * system . This system relies on the hypothesis that metaphors often represent a violation of selectional preferences in a given context ( Wilks 1975 , 3 EuroWordNet is a multilingual database with wordnets for several European languages ( Dutch , Italian , Spanish , German , French , Czech , and Estonian ) . The wordnets are structured in the same way as the Princeton WordNet for English . http : / / www . illc . uva . nl / EuroWordNet / . 590 Shutova Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems 1978 ) . Selectional preferences are the semantic constraints that a predicate places onto its arguments . Consider the following metaphorical expression . ( 5 ) My car drinks gasoline . ( Wilks 1978 ) The verb drink normally requires a grammatical subject of type ANIMATE and a gram - matical object of type LIQUID . Therefore , drink taking a car as a subject in Example ( 5 ) is an anomaly , which , according to Wilks , indicates a metaphorical use of drink . met * de - tects non - literalness via selectional preference violation , utilizing handcrafted descrip - tions of selectional preferences . In case of a violation , the respective phrase is ﬁrst tested for being metonymic , using hand - coded patterns ( e . g . , CONTAINER - FOR - CONTENT ) . If this fails , the system searches the knowledge base for a relevant analogy in order to dis - criminate metaphorical relations from the anomalous ones . For example , the sentence “My car drinks gasoline” would be represented in this framework as ( car , drink , gasoline ) , which does not satisfy the preference ( animal , drink , liquid ) , as car is not a hyponym of animal . met * then searches its knowledge base for a triple containing a hypernym of both the actual argument and the desired argument and ﬁnds ( thing , use , energy source ) , which represents the metaphorical interpretation . Fass ( 1991 ) presented the approach itself , but reported no evaluation results . More recently , Wilks et al . ( 2013 ) revisited this idea , acquiring selectional prefer - ences from lexical resources , namely VerbNet and WordNet . They focused on con - ventionalized metaphors included in lexical resources and proposed a technique for their automatic identiﬁcation . They see this work as complementary to the approaches that perform data - driven learning of selectional preferences . The latter , according to the authors , is likely to miss conventional metaphors because of their widespread presence in the data . Wilks and colleagues expect that selectional preferences acquired from term deﬁnitions in lexical resources would circumvent this issue and enable them to efﬁciently detect highly conventionalized metaphors . The main hypothesis behind their approach is that if the ﬁrst ( main ) WordNet sense of a word does not satisfy the preferences of its context in a given sentence , but has a lower ( less frequent ) sense in WordNet that satisﬁes the preference , then that use of the word and that WordNet sense are likely to be metaphorical . For instance , in the example “Mary married a brick ” , the ﬁrst sense of brick is ‘a physical object , ’ thus violating the preference of marry that selects for people , but the second sense of brick as ‘a reliable person’ satisﬁes this preference . To implement this approach , Wilks and colleagues acquire typical preferences of concepts ( i . e . , word senses ) from WordNet glosses . They use a semantic parser ( Allen , Swift , and de Beaumont 2008 ) to identify the nominal arguments of the verbs in glosses and their semantic roles and then abstract to their higher - level hypernyms in WordNet , which deﬁne the preferences . They compared the performance of their system to a baseline using hand - coded verb preferences in VerbNet . The evaluation was carried out on a set of 122 sentences from the domain of Governance , manually annotated for metaphoricity and selected so that the data set contains 50 % metaphorical instances and 50 % literal ones . They report an F - score of 0 . 49 for the VerbNet - based system and 0 . 67 for the WordNet - based one , the latter showing higher recall and the former higher precision . The approach of Wilks et al . rests on the assumption that WordNet sense ranking corresponds somewhat to the literal - to - metaphorical scale , as well as the assumption that there is only one literal sense for the given word . Although this may be true for the majority of senses , it is relatively easy to ﬁnd counter - examples . For instance , the ﬁrst WordNet sense of the verb erase is metaphorical , deﬁned as “remove from memory or existence , e . g . , The Turks erased the Armenians in 1915 , ” with the literal sense ranked 591 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 second . The reliance on WordNet sense numbering is thus a limitation of the presented approach . Another issue ( that the authors point out themselves ) is that this approach is likely to detect metonymic uses along with metaphor , and a method to discriminate between the two is still needed . The method of Krishnakumaran and Zhu ( 2007 ) uses hyponymy relation in Word - Net and word bigram counts to annotate metaphor at the sentence level . Given an IS - A metaphor ( e . g . , The world is a stage 4 ) they ﬁrst verify if the two nouns involved are in hyponymy relation in WordNet , and if this is not the case then the sentence is tagged as containing a metaphor . Along with this they consider expressions containing a verb or an adjective used metaphorically ( e . g . , “He planted good ideas in their minds” or “He has a fertile imagination” ) . In such cases , they calculate bigram probabilities of verb – noun and adjective – noun pairs ( including the hyponyms / hypernyms of the noun in question ) . If the combination is not observed in the data with sufﬁcient frequency , the system tags the sentence containing it as metaphorical . This idea follows the intuition of Wilks . However , by using bigram counts over verb – noun pairs Krishnakumaran and Zhu ( 2007 ) lose a great deal of information compared with a system extracting selectional preferences for speciﬁc grammatical relations from parsed text . The authors evaluated their system on a set of example sentences compiled from the MML , whereby highly conventionalized metaphors ( or dead metaphors ) are taken to be negative exam - ples , reporting an accuracy of 0 . 58 . Thus Krishnakumaran and Zhu do not deal with literal examples as such : Essentially , the distinction they are making is between the senses included in WordNet , even if they are conventional metaphors , and those not included in WordNet . 4 . 1 . 2 Statistical Learning for Metaphor Identiﬁcation . The ﬁrst statistical approach to meta - phor is the TroFi system ( Trope Finder ) of Birke and Sarkar ( 2006 ) . Their method is based on sentence clustering , originating from a similarity - based word sense disambiguation method developed by Karov and Edelman ( 1998 ) . The method uses a set of seed sentences , where the senses are annotated , computes similarity between the sentence containing the word to be disambiguated and all of the seed sentences , and selects the sense corresponding to the annotation in the most similar seed sentences . Birke and Sarkar adapt this algorithm to perform two - way classiﬁcation : literal versus non - literal , and they do not clearly deﬁne the kinds of tropes they aim to discover . They evaluated their system on a set of 25 verbs ( such as absorb , die , touch , knock , strike , pour , etc . ) , for each of which they extracted a set of sentences containing its literal and ﬁgurative uses , 1 , 298 in total , from the Wall Street Journal corpus . An example for the verb pour in their data set is shown in Figure 2 . Two annotators annotated the sentences for literalness , achieving an agreement of κ = 0 . 77 . The authors report a system performance of 53 . 8 % in terms of F - score on this data set . The metaphor identiﬁcation system of Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen ( 2010 ) also uses clustering techniques , but performs word clustering to discover verb – subject and verb – object metaphors in unrestricted text . It starts from a small seed set of metaphorical expressions , learns the analogies involved in their production , and extends the set of analogies by means of verb and noun clustering . The method is based on the hypoth - esis of “clustering by association”—namely , that in the course of distributional noun clustering , abstract concepts tend to cluster together if they are associated with the same source domain , whereas concrete concepts cluster by meaning similarity .

Figure 2 An example of the data of Birke and Sarkar ( 2006 ) . instance , democracy and marriage get clustered together , because both are associated with mechanisms , and as such appear with the mechanism terminology in the corpus . This allows the system to discover new , previously unseen conceptual and linguistic metaphors—for example , having seen the seed metaphor “ mend marriage” it infers that “the functioning of democracy” is also used metaphorically . This is how the system expands from the seed set to new concepts . Shutova , Sun and Korhonen used a spectral clustering algorithm with lexico - syntactic features to cluster verbs and nouns . They applied their system to continuous text ( the whole BNC ) and evaluated its performance on a random sample of the extracted metaphors against human judgments . They report a precision of 0 . 79 with an inter - judge agreement of k = 0 . 63 among ﬁve annotators . Their data - driven system favorably compares to a WordNet - based baseline , where synsets are used in place of automatically derived clusters . Shutova and colleagues have shown that the clustering - based solution has a signiﬁcantly wider coverage , capturing new metaphors rather than the synonymous ones , as well as yielding a 35 % increase in precision . However , Shutova , Sun and Korhonen did not evaluate the recall of their system , which is likely to be dependent on the size of the seed set and a relatively large and representative seed set is needed to achieve full coverage . Turney et al . ( 2011 ) classify verbs and adjectives as literal or metaphorical based on their level of concreteness or abstractness in relation to the noun they appear with . They learn concreteness rankings for words automatically ( starting from a set of examples ) and then search for expressions where a concrete adjective or verb is used with an abstract noun ( e . g . , “ dark humor” is tagged as a metaphor and “dark hair” is not ) . They used the data set of Birke and Sarkar ( 2006 ) for evaluation of verb metaphors and attain an F - score of 0 . 68 , which favorably compares to that of Birke and Sarkar . For adjectives , they have created their own data set of selected individual adjective – noun pairs for ﬁve adjectives : dark , deep , hard , sweet , and warm ; 100 phrases in total . These were then manually annotated for metaphoricity . As compared to these annotations , the accuracy of adjective classiﬁcation is 0 . 79 . However , the adjective data set was constructed with the concreteness feature in mind , and therefore the results reported for verb metaphors are likely to be more objective . Neuman et al . ( 2013 ) proposed an extension to the method of Turney et al . ( 2011 ) by incorporating the concept of selectional preferences into the concreteness - based model of metaphor . Their goal was to improve the performance of Turney’s algo - rithm by covering metaphors formed of concrete concepts only ( e . g . , “ broken heart” ) by detecting selectional preference violations . The authors address three types of met - aphor introduced by Krishnakumaran and Zhu ( 2007 ) and they claim to have ex - panded on Turney’s work by carrying out a more comprehensive evaluation of the abstractness – concreteness algorithm . However , the evaluation was done on only ﬁve 593 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 target concepts : governance , government , God , mother , and father . Sentences describing these concepts have been extracted from the Reuters ( Lewis et al . 2004 ) and New York Times ( Sandhaus 2008 ) corpora and annotated for metaphoricity . The authors measured the average precision of their system on this data set at 0 . 72 and the average recall at 0 . 80 . The improvement over Turney’s evaluation set - up was the annotation of complete sentences rather than isolated phrases . However , it should be noted that the system was evaluated on selected examples rather than continuous text . Heintz et al . ( 2013 ) applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) topic modeling ( Blei , Ng , and Jordan 2003 ) to the problem of metaphor identiﬁcation in experiments with En - glish and Spanish . Their goal was to create a minimally supervised metaphor processing system that can be applied to low - resource languages . The hypothesis behind their sys - tem is that a sentence that contains both source and target domain vocabulary contains a metaphor . The authors focused on the target domain of governance and have manually compiled a set of source concepts with which governance can be associated . They use LDA topics as proxies for source and target concepts , and if vocabulary from both source and target topics is present in a sentence , this sentence is tagged as containing a metaphor . The topics are learned from Wikipedia and then aligned to source and target concepts using sets of human - created seed words . When the metaphorical sentences are retrieved , the source topics that are common in the document are excluded , thus ensuring that the source vocabulary is transferred from a new domain . Although this allows the authors to ﬁlter out some literal uses , this may also lead to discarding cases of extended metaphor . The authors collected the data for their experiments from news Web sites and governance - related blogs in English and Spanish . They ran their system on this data , and output a ranked set of metaphorical examples . They carried out two types of evaluation : ( 1 ) top ﬁve examples for each conceptual metaphor judged by two annotators , reporting an F - score of 0 . 59 for English ( κ = 0 . 48 ) ; and ( 2 ) 250 top - ranked examples in system output annotated for metaphoricity using Amazon Mechanical Turk , yielding a mean metaphoricity of 0 . 41 ( standard deviation = 0 . 33 ) in English and 0 . 33 ( standard deviation = 0 . 23 ) in Spanish . One of the assumptions behind Heintz et al . ’s method is that the same source – target domain mappings manifest themselves across languages . Although this is likely to be true for primary metaphors ( Grady 1997 ) , as the authors point out themselves , this assumption may not extend to a broader spectrum of metaphors , and thus may lead to limited coverage in some languages , as well as false positives . Another issue that comes to mind concerns the learning of the topics themselves : Because a large number of metaphors are used conventionally within a particular topic ( e . g . “ cut taxes” ) , in principle such an approach would learn them as part of the target domain topics and may thus fail to recognize them as source domain terms . However , the authors do not comment on how often this was observed in their data . The method of Strzalkowski et al . ( 2013 ) also relies on modeling the topical struc - ture of text , although using different techniques from Heintz et al . ( 2013 ) . If Heintz et al . used LDA - acquired topics as approximations of concepts , Strzalkowski and colleagues identify topical chains ( Broadwell et al . 2013 ) by looking for sequences of concepts in text . They also experiment within a limited domain , the target domain of governance . Their method ﬁrst identiﬁes sentences containing target domain vocabulary and ex - tracts the surrounding ﬁve - sentence passage . They then identify topical chains in that passage , by linking the occurrences of nouns and verbs , including repetition , lexical variants , pronominal references , and WordNet synonyms and hyponyms . By virtue of this linking , the authors claim to “uncover the topical structure [ of the text ] that holds the narrative together . ” Their main hypothesis is that metaphorically used terms 594 Shutova Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems typically occur outside the core topical structure of the text , because they represent vo - cabulary imported from a different domain . For all the words that are found outside the topical chains , Strzalkowski et al . compute imageability scores and retain the highest - scoring ones as candidate metaphors , if they are in a syntactic relation with any of the target domain terms . The authors then extract common contexts in which the candi - dates are used in text corpora and cluster these contexts in order to identify potential source domains , the so - called “proto - sources . ” Strzalkowski et al . ( 2013 ) evaluated the performance of their method on four languages : English , Spanish , Russian , and Farsi . The evaluation was carried out against human judgments of system output that were obtained using Amazon Mechanical Turk . The authors report a metaphor identiﬁcation accuracy of 71 % in English , 80 % in Spanish , 69 % in Russian , and 78 % in Farsi . According to the paper , “hundreds” of instances were annotated in each language , although the exact number of instances is not reported . While the system performance is high , it should be noted that the experiments were carried out within a limited domain , and it is possible that the approach is not equally applicable to all domains . Because of its high reliance on imageability scores , it is likely to be able to delineate metaphorical language reasonably well for the abstract target domains , but less so for the concrete target domains . In the latter case , the target domain words may also exhibit high imageability , and the system would then rely solely on topic chain extraction to differentiate between literal and metaphorical language . The performance of the generalized system is thus dependent on the accuracy of topic chain extraction , which has not been evaluated inde - pendently . In addition , the current method ignores low - imageability metaphors , which abound even within the studied domain ( e . g . , “ invent a new form of governance” ) . Despite the lack of generality , Strzalkowski et al . ’s work , however , makes important contributions in that it addresses ( though indirectly ) the behavior of metaphor in discourse , and their framework can be viewed as a step towards modeling extended metaphor . Many other statistical methods treated metaphor identiﬁcation as a classiﬁcation problem . Such methods are described in the following section . 4 . 1 . 3 Metaphor Identiﬁcation as a Classiﬁcation Problem . Gedigian et al . ( 2006 ) presented a method that discriminates between literal and metaphorical language , using a max - imum entropy classiﬁer . They obtained their training and test data by extracting the lexical items whose frames are related to MOTION and CURE from FrameNet ( Fillmore , Johnson , and Petruck 2003 ) . They then searched the PropBank Wall Street Journal corpus ( Kingsbury and Palmer 2002 ) for sentences containing such lexical items and annotated them with respect to metaphoricity . They used PropBank annotation ( arguments and their semantic types ) as features to train the classiﬁer and report an accuracy of 95 . 12 % . This result is , however , only a little higher than the performance of the naive baseline assigning majority class to all instances ( 92 . 90 % ) . These numbers can be explained by the fact that 92 . 00 % of the verbs of MOTION and CURE in the Wall Street Journal corpus are used metaphorically , thus making the data set unbalanced with respect to the target categories and the task easier . The system of Li and Sporleder ( 2009 , 2010 ) detects idioms by measuring semantic similarity within and between the literal and non - literal parts of an utterance . The non - literal language considered by their model includes metaphors , as well as other types of ﬁgurative language . Their main assumption is that ﬁgurative uses break cohesion in the sentence , which is deﬁned by a similarity measure . This idea also goes back to Wilk’s selectional preference violation approach to metaphor ; however , combinations of word usages with larger sentential context are considered to determine the mismatch 595 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 ( or violation ) . Li and Sporleder used Normalized Google Distance ( Cilibrasi and Vitanyi 2007 ) as a similarity measure and a combination of classiﬁers ( support vector machines [ SVM ] and Gaussian mixture models [ GMM ] ) using similarity ( or cohesion ) information as features to learn idiomaticity scores . They evaluated their system on a data set of 17 idioms and their literal and non - literal contexts . For each expression , its occurrences were extracted from the Gigaword corpus along with ﬁve paragraphs of context . These examples were then annotated for literalness with an inter - annotator agreement of κ = 0 . 7 . There were 3 , 964 examples in total , with approximately 80 % of them being non - literal . They evaluated the method using 10 - fold cross - validation and report an F - score of 0 . 75 . However , they did not evaluate their system on metaphorical language independently . Dunn ( 2013a , 2013b ) presented an ontology - based domain interaction system MIMIL ( Measuring and Identifying Metaphor in Language ) , which identiﬁes metaphorical expressions at the utterance level . Dunn’s system ﬁrst maps the lexical items in the given utterance to concepts from SUMO ontology ( Niles and Pease 2001 , 2003 ) , assuming that each lexical item is used in its default sense ( i . e . , no sense disambiguation is performed ) . The system then extracts the properties of concepts from the ontology , such as their domain type ( ABSTRACT , PHYSICAL , SOCIAL , MENTAL ) and event status ( PROCESS , STATE , OBJECT ) . Those properties are then combined into feature - vector representations of the utterances . Dunn then applied a logistic regression classiﬁer implemented in Weka ( Witten and Frank 2005 ) , using these features to perform metaphor identiﬁcation . The work of Dunn ( 2013a , 2013b ) is notable as he conducted evaluation of four types of approaches and compared their performance on the same task ( identiﬁcation of metaphorical expressions in continuous text ) and on the same data ( Corpus of Contem - porary American English [ CoCA ] [ Davies 2009 ] and VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus [ Steen et al . 2010 ] ) . The evaluated approaches included the semantic similarity mea - surement method of Li and Sporleder ( 2009 , 2010 ) ; the concreteness - based method of Turney et al . ( 2011 ) ; the clustering - based method of Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen ( 2010 ) modeling source – target domain mappings ; and his own domain interaction method . Dunn re - implemented the four approaches as closely as possible to the original systems , although with some adjustments . A number of Dunn’s adjustments were operational ( e . g . , using logistic regression instead of SVM for the implementation of the similarity - based method of Li and Sporleder ( 2009 ) ; using a k - means clustering approach instead of spectral clustering for the method of Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen ( 2010 ) ; and using a different semantic relatedness measure for the method of Li and Sporleder ( 2009 ) ) . However , some adjustments were conceptual , for instance , using bag - of - words based semantic relatedness instead of dependency - based distributional similarity in the re - implementation of the clustering system . Admitting that these adjustments may have impacted the results and , as such , may not be an accurate reﬂection of the performance of the original algorithms in full , Dunn’s comparison of individual system features that were re - implemented nonetheless sheds light on the importance of particular properties of concepts for metaphor identiﬁcation . In his ﬁrst study ( Dunn 2013a ) , he evaluated the systems on the CoCA data , where the sentences were annotated as metaphorical , literal , or humorous ( however , neither the size of the data set nor the annotation procedure are described in Dunn’s article ) . On this data set , the clustering - based system and the domain - interaction method signiﬁcantly outperformed the other two systems , as shown in Figure 3 . Dunn explains such discrepancy by the fact that the former systems are both theory - based and aim to model the underlying mechanisms of metaphor , while the similarity - based and abstractness - based systems model its surface realizations . In his second study , conducted on the VU Amsterdam Metaphor corpus , Dunn ( 2013b ) 596 Shutova Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems 15 testing ; the evaluations were performed using cross - validation ( 100 folds ) . The F - measures reported here are for metaphor classification only ( i . e . , precision for non - metaphor is not directly considered because this inflates the performance of the systems ) . This is done because some of the systems greatly over - identify literal utterances ; however , because literal utterances dominate the evaluation data set , the over - identification of literal utterances would disproportionately raise the average F - measure for all classes in these systems . The feature vectors and other material used in the evaluation can be found at http : / / www . jdunn . name . Table 1 : Three - way distinction between metaphor , humor , and literal in all domains .

The joint system performed worse than the domain interaction system , showing that the abstractness and similarity features reduce performance . As shown in later tests , the measurements of abstractness and semantic similarity , both at the word - level , simply do not distinguish between metaphor and non - metaphor in a realistic data set . The domain interaction and source - target mapping systems performed much better . Both systems identified a similar number of metaphors ( 133 and 113 ) , but the domain interaction system had somewhat fewer false positives ( 382 vs . 461 ) . More importantly , the source - target mapping system had a significantly higher number of false negatives ( 300 vs . 63 ) . Using a higher number of seed metaphors would have lowered the source - target mapping system’s false negative rate , but at the same time that would likely have raised the already high false positive rate .

He evaluated the systems on two versions of the data set , one where named entities have been recognized during pre - processing and one without named - entity recognition . The results are shown in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively . Here , the domain - interaction and abstractness - based methods are leading , with the clustering - based method coming third . The difference in the results may be explained by the properties of the VU Amsterdam corpus . The corpus was compiled with an interest in historic aspects of metaphor , and , therefore , highly conventional and lexi - calized metaphors account for a large proportion of the data . What this suggests is that the domain - interaction and abstractness - based approaches are perhaps better - suited for processing lexicalized metaphors , whereas the clustering and similarity - based systems may fail to identify those due to their high frequency and the near - literal behavior in the data . In contrast , the domain - interaction system , which is knowledge - based , and the abstractness system , which relies on a non - changing property of concepts ( i . e . , concreteness ) , thus appear to be well - suited for handling lexicalized metaphors . Tsvetkov , Mukomel , and Gershman ( 2013 ) presented a supervised learning ap - proach that makes use of coarse semantic features . They experimented with metaphor Table 3 Dunn’s ( 2013b ) results on the VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus without named - entity recognition . System True Positive False Pos . True Negative False Neg .

They abstracted from the words in the English data to their higher level features , such as concreteness , ani - mateness , named entity labels , and coarse - grained WordNet categories ( corresponding to WN lexicographer ﬁles , 5 e . g . , noun . artifact , noun . body , verb . motion , verb . cognition ) . They focused on subject – verb – object constructions and annotated metaphor at the sentence level . The authors used a logistic regression classiﬁer and the combination of coarse se - mantic features for this purpose . They evaluated their model on the TroFi data set ( Birke and Sarkar 2006 ) for English and a self - constructed data set of 140 sentences for Russian , attaining the F - scores of 0 . 78 and 0 . 76 , respectively . Tsvetkov et al . ( 2014 ) extended this experiment to identify adjective – noun metaphors using similar features , as well as port - ing the model to two further languages ( Spanish and Farsi ) , achieving F - scores in the range of 0 . 72 to 0 . 85 . The results are encouraging and show that porting coarse - grained semantic knowledge across languages is feasible . However , it should be noted that the generalization to coarse semantic features inevitably only captures shallow behavior of metaphorical expressions in the data and bypasses conceptual information . In reality , as conﬁrmed by corpus - linguistic studies ( Charteris - Black and Ennis 2001 ; Kovecses 2005 ; Diaz - Vera and Caballero 2013 ) , there is considerable variation in metaphorical language across cultures , which makes training only on one language and simply translating the model less suitable for modeling conceptual structure behind metaphor , which is one of the limitations of this approach . However , the experiments of Tsvetkov and colleagues suggest that coarse semantic features could be a useful component of a more complex system . The approach of Mohler et al . ( 2013 ) relied on the concept of semantic signature of a text . The authors deﬁned semantic signatures as a set of highly related and interlinked WordNet senses . They induced domain - sensitive semantic signatures of texts and then trained a set of classiﬁers to detect metaphoricity within a text by comparing its se - mantic signature to a set of known metaphors . The main intuition behind this approach is that the texts whose semantic signature closely matches the signature of a known metaphor is likely to represent an instance of the same conceptual metaphor . Mohler and colleagues conducted their experiments within a limited domain ( the target domain of governance ) and manually constructed an index of known metaphors for this domain . They then automatically created the target domain signature and a signature for each source domain among the known metaphors in the index . This was done by means of semantic expansion of domain terms using WordNet , Wikipedia links , and corpus co - occurrence statistics . Given an input text their method ﬁrst identiﬁed all target domain terms using the target domain signature , then disambiguated the remaining terms using sense clustering and classiﬁed them according to their proximity to the source domains listed in the index . For the latter purpose , the authors experimented with a set of classiﬁers , including a maximum entropy classiﬁer , an unpruned decision tree classiﬁer , support vector machines , a random forest classiﬁer , as well as the combination thereof . They evaluated their system on a balanced data set containing 241 metaphorical and 241 literal examples , and obtained the highest result of F - score of 0 . 70 using the decision tree classiﬁer . Hovy et al . ( 2013 ) used the idea of selectional preference violation as the indicator of metaphor , taking it to the next level . They trained an SVM classiﬁer ( Cortes and Vapnik 1995 ) with tree kernels ( Moschitti , Pighin , and Basili 2006 ) to capture compositional 5 http : / / wordnet . princeton . edu / man / lexnames . 5WN . html . 598 Shutova Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems A bright idea . “ Peter is the bright , sympathetic guy when you ’re doing a deal , ” says one agent . yes Below he could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank . no Her bright eyes were twinkling . yes Washed , they came out surprisingly clear and bright . no Figure 1 : Examples of a metaphor seed , the matching Brown sentences , and their annotations thus probably not very helpful .

For example , the only difference between the two sentences “I like the sweet people in Boston” and “I like the sweet pies in Boston” is the head of “sweet” . Our assumption is that—given enough examples—certain patterns emerge ( e . g . , that “sweet” in combination with food nouns is literal , but is metaphorical if governed by a noun denoting people ) . We assume that these patterns occur on different levels , and mainly between syntactically related words . We thus need a data representation to capture these patterns . We borrow its structure from dependency trees , and the different levels from various annotations . We parse the input sentence with the FANSE parser ( Tratz and Hovy , 2011 ) 6 . It provides the dependency structure , POS tags , and other information . To construct the different tree representations , we replace each node in the tree with its word , lemma , POS tag , dependency label , or supersense ( the WordNet lexicographer name of the word’s ﬁrst sense ( Fellbaum , 1998 ) ) , and mark the word in question with a special node . See Figure 3 for a graphical representation . These trees are used in addition to the vectors . This approach is similar to the ones described in ( Moschitti et al . , 2006 ; Qian et al . , 2008 ; Hovy et al . , 2012 ) . 2 . 4 Classiﬁcation Models A tree kernel is simply a similarity matrix over tree instances . It computes the similarity between two trees T 1 , T 2 based on the number of shared subtrees . We want to make use of the information en - coded in the different tree representations during classiﬁcation , i . e . , a forest of tree kernels . We thus combine the contributions of the individual tree representation kernels via addition . We use kernels over the lemma , POS tag , and supersense tree representations , the combination which performed best on the dev set in terms of accuracy . We use the SVMlight TK implementation by Moschitti ( 2006 ) . 7 We left most parameters set to default values , but tuned the weight of the contribution of the trees and the cost factor on the dev set . We set the multiplicative constant for the trees to 2 . 0 , and the cost factor for errors on positive examples to 1 . 7 . 6 http : / / www . isi . edu / publications / licensed - sw / fanseparser / index . html 7 http : / / disi . unitn . it / moschitti / Tree - Kernel . htm 54 Figure 4 Data annotation example from Hovy et al . ( 2013 ) . properties of metaphorical language . Their hypothesis is that unusual semantic compo - sitions in the data may be indicative of the use of metaphor . They trained the model on labeled examples of literal and metaphorical uses of 329 words ( 3 , 872 sentences in total ) , with an expectation to learn the differences in their compositional behavior in the given lexico - syntactic contexts . The choice of dependency - tree kernels helped to capture such compositional properties , according to the authors . The authors constructed their data set by extracting sentences from the Brown corpus ( Francis and Kucera 1979 ) that contained the words of interest , and annotating them for metaphoricity using Amazon Mechanical Turk . Example entries for the adjective bright is shown in Figure 4 . Eighty percent of the data were used for training purposes , 10 % for parameter tuning , and 10 % for the evaluation . The learning was carried out using word vectors , as well as lexical , part - of - speech tags , and WordNet supersense representations of sentence trees as fea - tures , as shown in Figure 5 . The authors reported encouraging results ( F - score = 0 . 75 ) , which is an indication of the importance of syntactic information and compositionality in metaphor identiﬁcation . 4 . 2 Identiﬁcation of Conceptual Metaphors The ﬁrst method for automatic identiﬁcation of conceptual metaphor was the CorMet system of Mason ( 2004 ) . CorMet induced metaphorical mappings by identifying sys - tematic variations in domain - speciﬁc selectional preferences , which were learned in a data - driven way . For example , the verb pour has a strong selectional preference for A bright idea . “ Peter is the bright , sympathetic guy when you ’re doing a deal , ” says one agent . yes Below he could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank . no Her bright eyes were twinkling . yes Washed , they came out surprisingly clear and bright . no Figure 1 : Examples of a metaphor seed , the matching Brown sentences , and their annotations thus probably not very helpful .

( 2013 ) . 599 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 objects of type liquid in the LAB domain , and for money in the FINANCE domain . From this Mason’s system inferred the domain mapping FINANCE—LAB and the concept mapping money – liquid . Mason used WordNet for acquisition of selectional preference classes and , therefore , the source and target domain categories were represented as clusters of WordNet synsets . The domain - speciﬁc corpora were obtained by searching the Web for speciﬁc terms of interest . Mason conducted two types of evaluation : ( 1 ) against the MML , where he manually mapped his output ( WordNet synsets ) to concrete concepts described in the MML ( 13 mappings in total ) and then measured the accuracy at 77 % ( a mapping discovered by CorMet was considered correct if submappings spec - iﬁed in the MML were mostly present with high salience and incorrect submappings were present with relatively low salience ) ; and ( 2 ) by compiling a list of mappings at random ( assumed to be incorrect ) and showing that the system assigned low scores to those . Baumer , Tomlinson , and Richland ( 2009 ) reimplemented the method of Mason ( 2004 ) in the framework of computational metaphor identiﬁcation ( CMI ) procedure , and applied it to two types of corpora : student essays and political blogs . The authors presented some interesting examples of conceptual metaphors the system extracted , which they claim may foster critical thinking in social science . However , they did not carry out any quantitative evaluation . Li , Zhu , and Wang ( 2013 ) proposed a method that performs metaphor identiﬁcation using an “is - a” knowledge base . The authors automatically created two probabilistic knowledge bases by querying the Web using lexico - syntactic patterns . The ﬁrst knowl - edge base contained hypernym – hyponym relations and was acquired using Hearst patterns ( Hearst 1992 ) . The second knowledge base contained metaphors in the form (cid:104) target is a source (cid:105) learned using a “ * BE / VB like * ” pattern . The second database was then ﬁltered by removing the hypernym – hyponym relations present in the ﬁrst database , as well as symmetric relations , to form a metaphor knowledge base . The authors applied the resulting metaphor knowledge base to perform metaphor recognition and explanation . They experimented with nominal metaphors ( e . g . , “Juliet is the sun ” ) and verbal metaphors ( e . g . , “My car drinks gasoline” ) . In the case of nominal metaphors , the database was queried directly and the corresponding metaphor was either retrieved or not . In the case of verbal metaphors , where the noun denoting the source concept was not explicitly present in the sentence , it was derived based on the selectional preferences of the verbs . The authors computed selectional preferences of the given verb for the nouns present in the knowledge base , and “explained” the given metaphor by the noun exhibiting the highest selectional association with the metaphorical verb . For example , it outputs an explanation “car is a horse” for the metaphor in “my car drinks gasoline , ” since the conceptual metaphor CAR IS A HORSE is present in the knowledge base and horse satisﬁes the subject preference of drink . The authors evaluated their approach on a manually constructed data set of 200 randomly sampled sentences containing “is - a” constructions and 1 , 000 sentences containing metaphorical and literal uses of verbs . The annotation was carried out at the sentence level ( i . e . , complete sentences were annotated as metaphorical or not ) . The authors report an F - score of 69 % on the recognition of “is - a” metaphors and that of 58 % on the recognition of the verbal ones . Metaphor explanation performance ( i . e . , the source – target domain mappings generated for each recognized metaphor ) was evaluated separately on 214 sentences extracted from linguistic literature ( Lakoff and Johnson 1980 ) and the top - rank precision of 43 % is reported . Intuitively , a purely simile - based approach to metaphor is likely to both undergenerate ( a large number of metaphors would never be manifested in simile - like constructions ) and overgenerate ( “A is like B” pattern may describe other relations than metaphor ) . The key contribution of Li , Zhu , and Wang appears to be the ﬁltering 600 Shutova Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems method they introduce , as well as the selectional preference extension of the knowledge base to identify verbal metaphors . The method of Shutova and Sun ( 2013 ) learns metaphorical associations between concepts from the data in an unsupervised way . They created a network ( or a graph ) of concepts , using hierarchical graph factorization clustering of nouns , and quantiﬁed the strength of association between concepts in this graph . Concrete concepts exhibited well - deﬁned association patterns mainly based on subsumption within one domain , whereas abstract concepts tended to have both within - domain and cross - domain asso - ciations : the literal ones and the metaphorical ones . For example , the abstract concept of democracy was literally associated with a more general concept of political system , as well as metaphorically associated with the concept of mechanism . Because we often discuss political systems using the mechanism terminology , a corpus - based distributional learning approach learns that they share features with political systems ( from their literal uses ) , as well as with mechanisms ( from their metaphorical uses ) . The system of Shutova and Sun ( 2013 ) automatically discovered such association patterns within the graph and used them to identify metaphorical mappings . The mappings were represented in their system as cross - level , one - directional connections between clusters in the hierarchical graph ( e . g . , the feeling cluster was strongly associated with ﬁre ) . Example output for the source concepts of ﬁre and disease is shown in Figure 6 . To identify metaphorical expressions representing a given mapping , Shutova and Sun used the features that resulted in strong metaphorical associations between the clusters in question ( e . g . , “passion ﬂared ” for FEELING IS FIRE ) , as shown in Figure 7 . The authors evaluated the quality of metaphorical mappings and metaphorical expressions identiﬁed by the system against human judgments , as follows : ( 1 ) the human judges were presented with a random sample of system - produced metaphorical mappings between the clusters of nouns , as well as the corresponding metaphorical expressions , and asked to mark the ones they considered valid as correct ; ( 2 ) the human annotators were presented with a set of source domain concepts and asked to write down all target concepts they associated with a given source , thus creating a gold standard . Shutova and Sun report the precision of 0 . 69 for metaphorical associations and 0 . 65 for metaphorical expressions , as evaluated against human judgments , and the recall of 0 . 61 for metaphor - ical associations , as evaluated against a human - created gold standard . These results are encouraging in that they show that it is possible to induce information about metaphorical mechanisms from distributional properties of concepts alone , without SOURCE : ﬁre TARGET 1 : sense hatred emotion passion enthusiasm sentiment hope interest feeling resent - ment optimism hostility excitement anger TARGET 2 : coup violence ﬁght resistance clash rebellion battle drive ﬁghting riot revolt war confrontation volcano row revolution struggle TARGET 3 : alien immigrant TARGET 4 : prisoner hostage inmate SOURCE : disease TARGET 1 : fraud outbreak offense connection leak count crime violation abuse conspiracy corruption terrorism suicide TARGET 2 : opponent critic rival TARGET 3 : execution destruction signing TARGET 4 : refusal absence fact failure lack delay Figure 6 Metaphorical associations discovered by the system of Shutova and Sun ( 2013 ) . 601 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 FEELING IS FIRE hope lit ( Subj ) , anger blazed ( Subj ) , optimism raged ( Subj ) , enthusiasm engulfed them ( Subj ) , hatred ﬂared ( Subj ) , passion ﬂared ( Subj ) , interest lit ( Subj ) , fuel resentment ( Dobj ) , anger crackled ( Subj ) , feelings roared ( Subj ) , hostility blazed ( Subj ) , light with hope ( Iobj ) CRIME IS A DISEASE cure crime ( Dobj ) , abuse transmitted ( Subj ) , eradicate terrorism ( Dobj ) , suffer from corruption ( Iobj ) , diagnose abuse ( Dobj ) , combat fraud ( Dobj ) , cope with crime ( Iobj ) , cure abuse ( Dobj ) , eradicate corruption Figure 7 Shutova and Sun ( 2013 ) : Metaphorical expressions identiﬁed for the mappings FEELING IS FIRE and CRIME IS A DISEASE . the use of hand - coded knowledge . Nevertheless , the fact that clustering techniques are typically applied to a limited set of concepts ( i . e . , cluster a limited set of nouns ) somewhat constrains this approach . For instance , whereas common concepts ( that are well represented in the data ) can be clustered with a high accuracy , this is not always the case for rare concepts for which feature vectors are sparse . Thus an additional technique is needed to map new , unseen concepts to the concepts present in the graph . Gandy et al . ( 2013 ) presented a system that ﬁrst discovers metaphorical expressions using concreteness algorithm of Turney et al . ( 2011 ) and then assigns the corresponding metaphorical mappings using lexical resources and context clustering . They focused on the three types of metaphor deﬁned by Krishnakumaran and Zhu ( 2007 ) . Once the metaphorical expressions had been identiﬁed , Gandy et al . extracted the nouns that the metaphorical words , or facets , tend to co - occur within a large corpus ( e . g . , the nominal arguments of open in “ open government” ) . The goal of this process was to form candidate nominal analogies between the target noun in the metaphor and the extracted nouns . For example , the expression “ open government” suggests an analogy “government ∼ door , ” according to the authors . Figure 8 shows how nominal analogies are formed based on metaphorical usage cannot exist for one sense only . Then , the algorithm veriﬁes that the noun N belongs to at least one high - level semantic category ( using the WordStat dic - tionary of semantic categories based on Wordnet 1 ) . If not , the algorithm cannot make a decision and stops . Otherwise , it identiﬁes the n nouns most frequently collocated with A , and chooses the k most concrete nouns ( using the abstract - ness scale of ( Turney et al . 2011 ) ) . The high - level semantic categories represented in this list by at least i nouns each are selected ; if N does not belong to the any of them , the phrase is labeled as metaphorical , otherwise it is labeled as non - metaphorical . Based on exploratory analysis of a development dataset , separate from our test set , we set n = 1000 ; k = 100 ; and i = 16 . Nominal Analogies Once a set of metaphorical expressions S M = { h f , n t i } ( each a pair of a facet and a target noun ) is identiﬁed , we seek nominal analogies which relate two speciﬁc nouns , a source and a target . For example , if the system ﬁnds many different linguistic metaphors which can be interpreted as viewing governments as doors , we may have the nominal analogy “government ⇠ door . ” The basic idea behind the nominal analogy ﬁnding al - gorithm is that , since the metaphorical facets of a target noun are to be understood in reference to the source noun , we must ﬁnd source / target pairs such that many of the metaphorical facets of the target are associated in literal senses with the source ( see Figure 3 ) . The stronger and more numerous these associations , the more likely the nominal analogy is to be real . It should be noted that the system will not only ﬁnd fre - quent associations . Since the association strength of each facet - noun pairing is measured by PMI , not its raw fre - quency , infrequent pairings can ( and do ) pop up as signif - icant . Candidate generation . We ﬁrst ﬁnd a set S C of nouns as candidate source terms for nominal analogies . This set is the set of all nouns ( in a given corpus ) which have strong non - metaphoric associations with facets ( adjectives or verbs ) that are used in the linguistic metaphors in S M . We start with the set of all facets used in the linguistic metaphors in S M which have a positive point - wise mutual information ( PMI ; cf . ( Pantel and Lin 2002 ) ) with some target term in the set . We then deﬁne the set S C to consist of all other ( non - target ) nouns ( in a given large corpus ) associated with each of those facets ( in the appropriate syntactic relationships ) with a pos - itive PMI . A higher threshold than 0 can also be set , though we haven’t seen that increase precision , and it may reduce recall . For example , consider ﬁnding candidate source terms for the target term “government . ” We ﬁrst ﬁnd all facets in lin - guistic metaphors identiﬁed by the system that are associ - ated with “government” with a positive PMI . These include such terms as “better” , “big” , “small” , “divided” , “open” , 1 See http : / / provalisresearch . com / . Figure 3 : A schematic partial view of the nominal analogy “government ⇠ door . ” Facets in the middle are associated with the target noun on the left metaphorically , and with the source noun on the right literally . “closed” , and “limited . ” Each of these facets also are asso - ciated with other nouns in non - metaphorical senses . For in - stance , the terms “open” and “closed” are associated with the words “door” , “table” , “sky” , “arms” , and “house” . Identiﬁcation . To identify which pairs of candidate source terms in S C and target terms are likely nominal analo - gies , we seek a measurement of the similarity of the non - metaphorical facets of each candidate with the metaphorical facets of each target . To begin , we deﬁne for each facet f i and noun ( source or target ) n i the pair’s association score a ij as its PMI , and the pair’s metaphoricity score , m ij where m ij = 1 if the pair is judged by the system to be metaphorical and m ij = 0 if it is judged to be non - metaphorical . In our current system , all metaphoricity scores are either 1 or 0 , but ( as described below ) we plan to generalize the scheme to allow different levels of conﬁdence in linguistic metaphor classiﬁcation . We then deﬁne the a metaphoric facet distribution ( MFT ) for facets given target terms by normalizing the product of association and metaphoricity scores : P M ( f i | n j ) = a ij m ij P ij a ij m ij as well as a literal facet distribution ( LFT ) , similarly , as : P L ( f i | n j ) = a ij ( 1   m ij ) P ij a ij ( 1   m ij ) As noted above , we seek source term / target term pairs such that the metaphorical facets of the target term are likely to be literal facets of the source term and vice versa . A natu - ral measure of this tendency for a candidate source noun n s and candidate target noun n t is the Jensen - Shannon diver - gence between the LFT of n s and the MFT of n t , D JS ( P L ( · | n s ) k P M ( · | n t ) ) The larger the J - S divergence , the less likely the pair is to be a good nominal analogy . Figure 8 Nominal analogy induction from Gandy et al . ( 2013 ) . 602 Shutova Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems Figure 9 Gandy et al . ( 2013 ) : Three levels of analysis . a collection of metaphorical expressions . The individual ( related ) nominal analogies were then clustered together to identify conceptual metaphors , as shown in Figure 9 . The authors evaluated their system by annotating metaphorical expressions for ﬁve target concepts ( government , governance , god , father , and mother ) in selected sentences from the Reuters corpus ( Lewis et al . 2004 ) . They report very encouraging results : Pre - cision ( P ) = 0 . 76 , Recall ( R ) = 0 . 82 for verb metaphors ; P = 0 . 54 , R = 0 . 43 for adjectival metaphors ; and P = 0 . 84 , R = 0 . 97 for copula constructions . The authors also evaluated the quality of conceptual metaphors produced by the system against human judgments and attained a precision of 0 . 65 . However , the scope of the experiment is only limited to the given ﬁve concepts and it is not clear how well the method would generalize beyond these . Although the approach of Gandy et al . ( 2013 ) seems very promising , a comprehensive evaluation on open - domain corpus data is still necessary to prove its viability . 5 . Metaphor Interpretation Systems In one of the ﬁrst approaches to metaphor interpretation , Martin ( 1990 ) presented a Metaphor Interpretation , Denotation , and Acquisition System ( MIDAS ) , which ex - plained linguistic metaphors through ﬁnding the corresponding conceptual metaphor . The method is based on the idea of hierarchical organization of conventional metaphors , namely , that more speciﬁc conventional metaphors descend from the general ones . Given an example of a metaphorical expression , MIDAS searched its database for a corresponding metaphor that would explain the anomaly . If it did not ﬁnd any , it abstracted from the example to more general concepts and repeated the search . If it found a suitable general metaphor , it created a mapping for its descendant , a more speciﬁc metaphor , based on the given example . This was also how novel metaphors were acquired . MIDAS was integrated with the Unix Consultant ( UC ) , the system that answers users’ questions about Unix . The UC ﬁrst tried to ﬁnd a literal answer to the question . Failing to do so , it called MIDAS , which detected metaphorical expressions via selectional preference violation and searched its database for a metaphor explaining the anomaly in the question . Another branch of early work on metaphor interpretation relied on performing inferences about entities and events in the source and target domains . The most promi - nent approaches include the KARMA system ( Narayanan 1997 , 1999 ; Feldman and 603 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 Narayanan 2004 ) and the ATT - Meta project ( Barnden and Lee 2002 ; Agerri et al . 2007 ) . Within both systems the authors developed a metaphor - based reasoning framework in accordance with the theory of conceptual metaphor . The reasoning process relied on manually constructed knowledge about the world and operated mainly in the source domain . The results were then projected onto the target domain using the conceptual mapping representation . The ATT - Meta project concerned metaphorical and metonymic description of mental states and reasoning about mental states using ﬁrst order logic . Their system , however , did not take natural language sentences as input , but logical expressions that are representations of small discourse fragments . KARMA in turn dealt with a broad range of abstract actions and events and took parsed text as input . Since then the ﬁeld moved towards acquiring the knowledge necessary for meta - phor interpretation automatically ( and at a larger scale ) from lexical resources , corpora , and the Web . Veale and Hao ( 2008 ) derived a “ﬂuid knowledge representation for metaphor interpretation and generation , ” called Talking Points . Talking Points are a set of characteristics of concepts belonging to source and target domains and related facts about the world which the authors acquired automatically from WordNet and from the Web . Talking Points were then organized in Slipnet , a framework that allowed for a number of insertions , deletions , and substitutions in deﬁnitions of such characteris - tics in order to establish a connection between the target and the source concepts . This work built on the idea of slippage in knowledge representation for understand - ing analogies in abstract domains ( Hofstadter and Mitchell 1994 ; Hofstadter 1995 ) . Example ( 6 ) demonstrates how slippage operates to explain the metaphor Make - up is a Western burqa . ( 6 ) Make - up = > ≡ typically worn by women ≈ expected to be worn by women ≈ must be worn by women ≈ must be worn by Muslim women Burqa < = By doing insertions and substitutions the system arrived from the deﬁnition typically worn by women to that of must be worn by Muslim women , and thus established a link between the concepts of make - up and burqa . Veale and Hao ( 2008 ) , however , did not evaluate to what extent their knowledge base of Talking Points and the associated reasoning framework are useful to interpret metaphorical expressions occurring in text . Shutova ( 2010 ) deﬁned metaphor interpretation as a paraphrasing task and pre - sented a method for deriving literal paraphrases for metaphorical expressions from the BNC . For example , for the metaphors in “All of this stirred an unfathomable excitement in her” or “a carelessly leaked report , ” their system produced interpretations All of this provoked an unfathomable excitement in her and a carelessly disclosed report , respec - tively . They ﬁrst applied a probabilistic model to rank all possible paraphrases for the metaphorical expressions , given the context ; and then used automatically induced selec - tional preferences to discriminate between ﬁgurative and literal paraphrases . The selec - tional preference distribution was deﬁned in terms of selectional association measures introduced by Resnik ( 1993 ) over the noun classes automatically produced by Sun and Korhonen ( 2009 ) . Shutova ( 2010 ) tested her system only on metaphors expressed by a verb and reports an accuracy of 0 . 81 , as evaluated on top - ranked paraphrases produced by the system . However , she used WordNet for supervision , which limits the number and range of paraphrases that can be identiﬁed by her method . Shutova , Van de Cruys , 604 Shutova Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems and Korhonen ( 2012 ) and Bollegala and Shutova ( 2013 ) expanded on this work , ad - dressing the metaphor paraphrasing task in an unsupervised setting and extending the coverage . The method of Shutova , Van de Cruys , and Korhonen ( 2012 ) ﬁrst computed candidate paraphrases according to the context in which the metaphor appeared , using a vector space model . It then used a selectional preference model to measure the degree of literalness of the paraphrases . The authors evaluated their method on the metaphor paraphrasing data set of Shutova ( 2010 ) and reported a top - rank precision of 0 . 52 . Bollegala and Shutova ( 2013 ) used a similar experimental set - up , however , their method extracted a set of candidate paraphrases from the Web using lexico - syntactic patterns as queries and ranked them based on search engine hits , attaining a precision of 0 . 42 . Shutova , Teufel , and Korhonen ( 2013 ) combined metaphor identiﬁcation ( Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen 2010 ) and interpretation ( Shutova 2010 ) to perform text - to - text metaphor processing . The resulting system could take arbitrary text as input , parse it using a syntactic parser , identify metaphorical expressions in it , retrieve their literal paraphrases , and output a new version of the text in which metaphors were interpreted . The motivation behind such a set - up was that it allowed for a relatively straightfor - ward integration with external NLP applications . To evaluate the system , the authors extracted a random sample of 200 metaphorical expressions the system identiﬁed in the BNC and applied the paraphrasing method to them . They evaluated the accu - racy of metaphor identiﬁcation and interpretation when performed simultaneously , as well as the system’s applicability . The applicability was deﬁned as the proportion of cases where the paraphrase was literal and the meaning of the phrase was retained , indicating whether this type of system paraphrasing would result in an error when hypothetically integrated with an external NLP application . In 54 % of cases , the system both identiﬁed and interpreted the metaphor correctly , which is a promising result . In a further 13 % of cases , the system produced a correct , literal paraphrase for a literal expression erroneously identiﬁed as a metaphor , leading to the overall applicability of integrated metaphor processing at 67 % . Although the system is easy to integrate with external NLP applications that could beneﬁt from metaphor resolution , it should be noted that some information conveyed by the metaphor is inevitably lost during literal paraphrasing . Metaphor paraphrasing as an approach thus rests on a crucial assumption that the beneﬁt of correct metaphor understanding would outweigh the loss of additional connotations and rhetorical elements . This assumption is yet to be veriﬁed through an integration of this technology into real - world NLP , however . Shutova ( 2013 ) presented a computational method that identiﬁed metaphorical expressions in unrestricted text by means of their interpretation . She again treated metaphor interpretation as paraphrasing and introduced the concept of symmetric reverse paraphrasing as a criterion for metaphor identiﬁcation . The hypothesis behind the method is that literal paraphrases of literally used words should yield the origi - nal phrase when paraphrased in reverse . For example , when the expression clean the house is paraphrased as tidy the house , the reverse paraphrasing of tidy would generate clean as one of possible paraphrases . Shutova’s expectation was that such symmetry in paraphrasing is indicative of literal use . The metaphorically used words are unlikely to exhibit this symmetry property when paraphrased in reverse . For example , the literal paraphrasing of the verb stir in “ stir excitement” would yield “ provoke excitement , ” but the reverse paraphrasing of provoke would not retrieve stir , indicating the non - literal use of stir . Shutova experimentally veriﬁed this hypothesis in a setting involving single - word metaphors expressed by a verb in verb – subject and verb – direct object relations . She applied the selectional preference - based metaphor paraphrasing method ( Shutova 2010 ) to retrieve literal paraphrases of all input verbs and extended the method to 605 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 FYT Gorbachev inherited a Soviet state which was , in a celebrated Stalinist formulation , “national in form but socialist in content . ” Paraphrase : Gorbachev received a Soviet state which was , in a celebrated Stalinist formula - tion , “national in form but socialist in content . ” CEK The Clinton campaign surged again and he easily won the Democratic nomination .

She evaluated the perfor - mance of the system on verb – subject and verb – object relations using the manually annotated metaphor corpus of Shutova and Teufel ( 2010 ) , reporting a precision of 0 . 68 and a recall of 0 . 66 . The system outperformed a baseline using selectional preference violation as an indicator of metaphor , that only attained a precision of 0 . 17 and a recall of 0 . 55 . Some examples of metaphorical expressions identiﬁed by the system and their literal paraphrases are shown in Figure 10 . 6 . Investigated Techniques and Lessons Learned The community has investigated a wide range of techniques and features for meta - phor identiﬁcation and interpretation in a variety of experimental settings . The major - ity of identiﬁcation systems focus on the linguistic level , identifying either linguistic metaphor or non - literal language more generally , with a few identifying conceptual metaphor . Table 4 presents a summary of the tasks addressed . Some systems annotated metaphorical expressions at the word level , whereas others opted for the relation level or carried out sentence - level annotation . Individual approaches frequently limited the scope of their experiments to metaphors expressed by a particular part of speech and syntactic construction , as shown in Table 5 . The majority of the systems focused on metaphorically used verbs or adjectives , with a few also considering nouns ( in modiﬁer or copula constructions ) and multiword metaphors . The systems that identiﬁed con - ceptual metaphor also exhibit some variation in the representations they used . Source and target domains were represented as WordNet synsets ( Mason 2004 ) ; individual nouns ( Li , Zhu , and Wang 2013 ) ; or clusters of nouns ( Shutova and Sun 2013 ; Gandy et al . 2013 ) . Recent work on metaphor interpretation unfolded along two main axes : metaphor explanation ( i . e . , identifying the properties of concepts that the metaphor 606 Shutova Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems Table 4 Identiﬁcation systems : Task deﬁnition .

The common methods used include supervised classiﬁcation ( Gedigian et al . 2006 ; Dunn 2013a ; Hovy et al . 2013 ; Mohler et al . 2013 ; Tsvetkov , Mukomel , and Gershman 2013 ) ; clustering ( Gandy et al . 2013 ; Shutova and Sun 2013 ; Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen 2010 ; Strzalkowski et al . 2013 ) ; vector space models ( Shutova , Van de Cruys , and Korhonen 2012 ) ; the use of lexical resources and ontologies ( Mason 2004 ; Krishnakumaran and Zhu 2007 ; Dunn 2013b ; Gandy et al . 2013 ; Hovy et al . 2013 ; Mohler et al . 2013 ; Strzalkowski et al . 2013 ; Tsvetkov , Mukomel , and Gershman 2013 ; Wilks et al . 2013 ) ; and Web search ( Veale and Hao 2008 ; Bollegala and Shutova 2013 ; Li , Zhu , and Wang 2013 ) . A summary of techniques investigated by the community is presented in Table 6 . In what follows we will discuss the main trends in metaphor processing research and the usefulness of individual types of techniques . 6 . 1 Selectional Preferences Selectional preferences have long established themselves as one of the central compo - nents in metaphor - processing research . Wilks’ ( 1978 ) selectional preference violation view of metaphor has been highly inﬂuential , with numerous approaches to metaphor identiﬁcation implementing it directly or indirectly ( Fass 1991 ; Martin 1990 ; Wilks et al . 2013 ) . Other approaches modiﬁed this view and treated metaphor as a violation of semantic norm construed more broadly—for example , searching for expressions with low bi - gram probabilities ( Krishnakumaran and Zhu 2007 ) , identifying units that break sentence cohesion ( Li and Sporleder 2009 , 2010 ) , or detecting unusual patterns in words’ compositional behavior ( Hovy et al . 2013 ) . Generally speaking , selectional preference violations ( or other semantic violations mentioned above ) are a property of surface realization of metaphor rather than its underlying conceptual mechanisms . One needs to bear this in mind when using this as a heuristic . On one hand , such violations are indicative of any kind of non - literalness ( i . e . , not only metaphor , but also , for instance , metonymy ) or anomaly in language and the approach is likely to overgenerate . On the other hand , in the case of most conventional metaphors that are highly frequent , no statistically signiﬁcant violation can be detected in the data , and the approach would bypass many such metaphors . Shutova ( 2013 ) conducted a data - driven study , where verb preferences were automatically acquired from the data and all the nominal arguments below a certain selectional association threshold were considered to represent a violation and were tagged as metaphorical . Such a technique attained a precision of 0 . 17 and a recall of 0 . 55 , suggesting that the selectional preference violation hypothesis does not port well beyond handcrafted descriptions to large - scale , data - driven techniques . In contrast , other , “non - violation” applications of selectional preferences have been fruitful in metaphor modeling . Mason ( 2004 ) automatically acquired domain - speciﬁc selectional preferences of verbs , and then , by mapping their common nominal ar - guments in different domains , arrived at the corresponding metaphorical mappings . Shutova ( 2010 ) presented a modiﬁcation of Wilks’ view , treating a strong selectional preference ﬁt as a likely indicator of literalness or conventionality . In her metaphor paraphrasing system , Shutova ranks candidate paraphrases based on how well the 609 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 context ﬁts their preferences , thus determining their literalness . In their metaphor iden - tiﬁcation system , Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen ( 2010 ) ﬁltered out verbs that have weak selectional preferences , that is , that are equally associated with many argument classes ( e . g . , choose or remember ) , as having a lower metaphorical potential . Li , Zhu , and Wang ( 2013 ) used selectional preferences to assign the corresponding conceptual metaphor to metaphorical expressions . Although the idea of violation ( i . e . , treating metaphor as merely a context outlier ) is controversial and should be applied with care , selectional preferences themselves are an important source of semantic information about the properties of concepts , which can be successfully exploited in metaphor processing in a variety of ways . 6 . 2 Topical Structure of Text Two approaches ( Heintz et al . 2013 ; Strzalkowski et al . 2013 ) focused on modeling topical structure of text to identify metaphor . The main hypothesis behind these meth - ods is that metaphorical language ( coming from a different domain ) would represent atypical vocabulary within the topical structure of the text . This intuition is somewhat similar to the idea of semantic norm violation as an indicator of metaphor , although it is different in two crucial ways : ( 1 ) topical structure - based approaches explicitly model the interaction of vocabulary from two different domains ( i . e . , the source and the target ) ; and ( 2 ) these approaches take into account domain interactions over extended discourse fragments , rather than individual expressions , thus utilizing information from wider context . Exploiting the wider topical structure of text is a promising avenue for meta - phor processing . However , one needs to keep in mind that distributional similarity - based methods risk assigning frequent metaphors to target domains ( as is the case for other semantic violation - based methods ) . For instance , cut may appear more frequently within the domain of economics and ﬁnance , rather than its original source domain . The choice of data for training such a model thus becomes crucial , and an appropri - ately balanced data set is needed . Investigating the topical structure of text is also an important step towards modeling extended metaphor , which interweaves the narrative in complex , but systematic ways . 6 . 3 Concreteness Turney et al . ( 2011 ) introduced the idea of measuring concreteness of concepts to predict metaphorical use . The intuition behind their approach is that metaphor is commonly used to describe abstract concepts in terms of more concrete or physical experiences . Thus , Turney and colleagues expect that there would be some discrepancy in the level of concreteness of source and target terms in the metaphor . Neuman et al . ( 2013 ) and Gandy et al . ( 2013 ) followed in Turney’s steps , reporting promising results . Tsvetkov , Mukomel , and Gershman ( 2013 ) took a different route , and used concreteness as one of the features to train a classiﬁer . Strzalkowski et al . ( 2013 ) experimented with the image - ability feature ( that indicates how easy it is to visualize a concept ) and demonstrated its relevance to metaphor identiﬁcation . Based on the results of these experiments , concreteness is likely to be a practically useful feature for metaphor processing . However , it should be noted that Turney’s hypothesis ( that target words tend to be abstract and source words tend to be con - crete ) explains only a fraction of metaphors and does not always hold . For example , one can use concrete – concrete metaphors ( e . g . , “ broken heart” ) , abstract – abstract meta - phors ( “ diagnose corruption” ) , and even abstract – concrete metaphors ( “ invent a soup” ) . 610 Shutova Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems However , it may be the case that within the concrete – abstract class of metaphor , the method operates with reasonable performance . Thus concreteness may become a useful feature of a more complex system that takes multiple factors into account , but is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of metaphor on its own . 6 . 4 Supervised Classiﬁcation A number of approaches trained classiﬁers on manually annotated data to recognize metaphor . The key question that supervised classiﬁcation poses is what features are indicative of metaphor and how can one abstract from individual expressions to its high - level mechanisms ? The community has experimented with a number of features , including lexical and syntactic information ; higher - level features such as semantic roles , WordNet supersenses , named - entity types , and domain types extracted from ontologies ; and semantic properties of concepts , such as animateness and concreteness . Gedigian et al . ( 2006 ) classiﬁed verb uses as literal or metaphorical , using the verbs’ nominal arguments and their semantic roles ( as annotated in PropBank ) as features . They reported unusually high performance scores , although the narrow focus on spe - ciﬁc lexical items makes it possible for the system to learn a model for individual words rather than performing generalization . In contrast , Dunn ( 2013a , 2013b ) experimented with a wide range of metaphorical expressions from the VU Amsterdam Metaphor corpus , using high - level properties of concepts extracted an ontology , such as domain type and event status . Tsvetkov , Mukomel , and Gershman ( 2013 ) and Tsvetkov et al . ( 2014 ) used coarse semantic features , such as concreteness , animateness , named - entity types , and WordNet supersenses . What is particularly interesting about this work is that the authors have shown that the model learned with such coarse semantic features is portable across languages , thus suggesting that the chosen features successfully capture some of the properties of metaphor ( even if the shallow ones ) . The work of Hovy et al . ( 2013 ) is notable as they focused on compositional rather than categorical features . They trained an SVM with dependency - tree kernels to capture compositional information using lexical , part - of - speech tags , and WordNet supersense representations of sentence trees , achieving successful results . The system of Mohler et al . ( 2013 ) aimed at modeling conceptual information in the form of semantic signatures of domains and metaphors . Such rich semantic information is likely to be a successful feature in metaphor recognition : however , Mohler and colleagues experimented within a limited domain and it is not clear how scalable such features would be . To reliably capture the patterns of the use of metaphor in the data at a large scale , one needs to address conceptual properties of metaphor , along with the surface ones . Thus the models making generalizations at the level of metaphorical mappings and coarse - grained classes of concepts , in essence representing different domains , are likely to yield the optimal framework for the task . However , this hypothesis is yet to be experimentally veriﬁed . 6 . 5 Clustering Clustering techniques were used in numerous approaches , predominantly to identify concepts similar or related to each other . Mason ( 2004 ) performed WordNet sense clustering to obtain selectional preference classes , whereas Mohler et al . ( 2013 ) used it to determine similarity between concepts and to link them in semantic signatures . Strzalkowski et al . ( 2013 ) and Gandy et al . ( 2013 ) clustered metaphorically used terms to 611 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 form potential source domains . Birke and Sarkar ( 2006 ) clustered sentences containing metaphorical and literal uses of verbs . Another line of research focused on the use of clustering methods to investigate how metaphor partitions the linguistic feature space . Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen ( 2010 ) pointed out that the metaphorical uses of words constitute a large portion of the co - occurrence features extracted for abstract concepts from the data . For example , the feature vector for politics would contain GAME or MECHANISM terms among the frequent features . As a result , distributional clustering of abstract nouns with such features identiﬁes groups of diverse concepts metaphorically associated with the same source domain ( or sets of source domains ) . Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen exploit this property of co - occurrence vectors to identify new metaphorical mappings starting from a set of examples . The work of Shutova and Sun ( 2013 ) is based on the same observation . Through the use of hierarchical clustering techniques they derive a network of concepts in which metaphorical associations are exhibited at different levels of generality . 6 . 6 The Use of Lexical Resources Peters and Peters ( 2000 ) and Wilks et al . ( 2013 ) detected metaphor directly in lexical resources . Peters and Peters mine WordNet for examples of systematic polysemy , which allows them to capture metonymic and metaphorical relations . Their system searches for nodes that are relatively high in the WordNet hierarchy ( i . e . , are relatively general ) and that share a set of common word forms among their descendants . Peters and Peters found that such nodes often happen to be in a metonymic ( e . g . , publisher – publication ) or a metaphorical ( e . g . theory – supporting structure ) relation . Wilks et al . ( 2013 ) used WordNet glosses to learn selectional preferences of verbs , which were then used to annotate senses as literal or metaphorical , based on the selectional preference – violation hypothesis . Krishnakumaran and Zhu ( 2007 ) use hyponymy relation in WordNet to detect semantic violations . Shutova ( 2010 , 2013 ) also relied on the hierarchical structure of WordNet , but to identify concepts that share common features ( deﬁned as sharing a common hypernym within three levels of the hierarchy ) . WordNet synsets were also used to form selectional preference classes in SP - based methods ( Mason 2004 ) or to detect semantically related concepts ( Mohler et al . 2013 ; Strzalkowski et al . 2013 ; Gandy et al . 2013 ) . Other researchers used WordNet to identify high - level properties of concepts , most notably WordNet supersenses , that served as features for classiﬁcation ( Tsvetkov , Mukomel , and Gershman 2013 ; Hovy et al . 2013 ) . 6 . 7 Web Search Because metaphor is a knowledge - intensive phenomenon , multiple approaches at - tempted to acquire the knowledge necessary for its identiﬁcation and interpretation from the Web ( Veale and Hao 2008 ; Bollegala and Shutova 2013 ; Li , Zhu , and Wang 2013 ) . Web search engines provide a ﬂexible tool for retrieving information that matches speciﬁc lexico - syntactic patterns ( used as queries ) and quantifying co - occurrence . Veale and Hao ( 2008 ) query the Web to harvest properties of concepts and cultural stereo - types , such as has magical skill for Wizard or has brave spirit for Lion , which are then used to perform metaphor interpretation through property comparison and substitu - tion . Bollegala and Shutova ( 2013 ) use the Web to extract co - occurrence information for verbs and nouns , which allows them to generate a set of candidate paraphrases for metaphorical verbs . Li , Zhu , and Wang ( 2013 ) query the Web with Hearst pat - terns to acquire a large knowledge base of hyponymy relations ; and simile patterns 612 Shutova Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems ( * is like * ) to acquire a set of potential conceptual metaphors . Along with the ﬂexibility and convenience of information retrieval tools , these three approaches also boast of wide coverage that the use of the Web allows them to achieve . The knowledge contained on the Web is not merely vast , but it is also constantly updated , which allows the system to stay on par with the current events and trends . Because metaphor is a productive and dynamic phenomenon ( new metaphors arise as new events take place ) , such scalability and ongoing expansion of the Web make it an attractive corpus for metaphor research . 7 . System Evaluation System evaluation methodologies continue to be debated in many areas of compu - tational semantics . Identifying a comprehensive and fair evaluation strategy for the task in mind is crucial for the development of fully functional NLP systems . In that light , a number of shared tasks have been proposed over the years at Workshops on Semantic Evaluation ( SemEval ) that enabled performance comparison across systems and methods . Such tasks as sentiment analysis , word similarity , word sense induction and disambiguation , coreference resolution , lexical substitution , and many others are commonly addressed at SemEval and have a number of benchmark data sets created for them ( Agirre and Soroa 2007 ; McCarthy and Navigli 2007 ; Lefever and Hoste 2010 ; Manandhar et al . 2010 ; Mihalcea , Sinha , and McCarthy 2010 ; Recasens et al . 2010 ; Nakov et al . 2013 ) , against which the systems are evaluated and compared . Computational work on metaphor , on the contrary , is considerably more fragmented than similar research efforts in other areas of NLP . With the lack of an established data set , the community has utilized a variety of evaluation strategies , including the use of anno - tated corpora , human judgments of system output , evaluation against the MML , and annotation of individual selected examples ( usually phrases or sentences ) via Amazon Mechanical Turk . With a few exceptions , the majority of approaches created their own test sets , making the results not directly comparable . The most desirable type of evaluation is that conducted against an annotated full - text corpus , namely , naturally occurring , continuous text manually annotated for metaphor . Ideally , such a corpus should be open - domain and representative of a range of genres , making the results indicative of the likely performance of the system on arbitrary text . Another beneﬁt of this type of evaluation is that it allows one to assess both the precision and the recall of the system . However , only two of the presented approaches ( Dunn 2013b ; Shutova 2013 ) conducted this type of evaluation , as shown in Table 7 . More typically , approaches were instead evaluated on a random sample of system output against human judgments ( Mason 2004 ; Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen 2010 ; Heintz et al . 2013 ; Shutova and Sun 2013 ; Strzalkowski et al . 2013 ) . Although this type of evaluation allows one to measure the precision of the system on a random sample , it does not provide any information about the possible recall . Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen ( 2010 ) and Shutova and Sun ( 2013 ) applied their methods to a general - domain corpus ( the BNC ) , from which a random sample of metaphorical expressions annotated by the system was then extracted for evaluation . In contrast , Heintz et al . ( 2013 ) and Strzalkowski et al . ( 2013 ) collected their data with a focus on a limited domain . The experiments of Mason ( 2004 ) and Shutova and Sun ( 2013 ) were concerned with conceptual metaphor , and a random sample of the metaphorical mappings identi - ﬁed by the systems was extracted and evaluated against human judgments in terms of precision . However , the latter two approaches also measured recall , by manually com - piling a gold - standard of metaphorical mappings for the concepts of interest ( Shutova and Sun 2013 ) or against the MML ( Mason 2004 ) . 613 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 Table 7 Identiﬁcation systems : Evaluation set - up .

Such examples were annotated as metaphorical or literal by independent expert annotators or via Amazon Mechanical Turk . The beneﬁt of this set - up ( as opposed to the evaluation on a random sample of system output ) is that it allows one to measure both precision and recall . However , the method used for selection of individual examples may introduce a bias into the evaluation and provide an unfair advantage to the system , unless the test sample was selected randomly from arbitrary text . In other words , this type of evaluation is likely to be less objective than the evaluation on continuous corpus text or a random sample . A number of approaches ( Gedigian et al . 2006 ; Krishnakumaran and Zhu 2007 ; Gandy et al . 2013 ; Heintz et al . 2013 ; Mohler et al . 2013 ; Neuman et al . 2013 ; Strzalkowski et al . 2013 ; Wilks et al . 2013 ) conducted their experiments within a limited domain . Despite allowing for an in - depth investigation of domain - speciﬁc patterns of metaphor use , such evaluations are problematic as they provide no indication of the scalability of the method beyond the studied domain to real - world data . This criticism also applies to the evaluations against MML , as the list is limited in domain coverage and the type of metaphors it provides . Two data sets stand out as having been repeatedly adopted for metaphor research , enabling direct system comparison . These include the TroFi data set of Birke and Sarkar ( 2006 ) and the metaphor paraphrasing data set of Shutova ( 2010 ) . The TroFi dataset consists of 25 verbs and example sentences , containing their metaphorical and literal use . It was adopted by Turney et al . ( 2011 ) and Tsvetkov , Mukomel , and Gershman ( 2013 ) in their metaphor identiﬁcation experiments . The paraphrasing data set and gold standard of Shutova ( 2010 ) consists of 52 metaphorically used verbs and their human - derived literal ( or more conventional ) paraphrases in the given context .

( 2011 ) report results on the verb dataset in terms of F - score and on the adjec - tive dataset in terms of accuracy . LM stands for linguistic metaphor and CM for conceptual metaphor . has been used in multiple metaphor interpretation experiments ( Shutova 2010 ; Shutova , Van de Cruys , and Korhonen 2012 ; Bollegala and Shutova 2013 ) . The evaluations of metaphor identiﬁcation tend to be conducted in terms of pre - cision and recall , and occasionally , accuracy . Table 8 presents a summary of results of metaphor identiﬁcation experiments , classiﬁed by domain coverage . The most suc - cessful systems attain an F - score in the range of 70 – 78 % , with the highest precision reported for the methods of Tsvetkov , Mukomel , and Gershman ( 2013 ) , Shutova , Sun , and Korhonen ( 2010 ) , and Gandy et al . ( 2013 ) ; and the highest recall for the methods of Mohler et al . ( 2013 ) , Wilks et al . ( 2013 ) , Gandy et al . ( 2013 ) ( limited domain ) and Tsvetkov , Mukomel , and Gershman ( 2013 ) and Hovy et al . ( 2013 ) ( open domain ) . How - ever , because the methods were evaluated on data sets of different size and balance of categories , as well as created with different criteria in mind , this comparison is only approximate . A comprehensive evaluation on the same large data set is needed to determine the best performing techniques . For example , the accuracy of 95 % reported by Gedigian et al . ( 2006 ) was measured on a data set dominated by metaphorical ex - pressions ( all metaphor baseline achieves 92 % ) . This result cannot be directly compared to that of a system evaluated on a test set with a balance of metaphorical and literal instances . One of the key difﬁculties metaphor processing research is facing today is that of a lack of annotated data . The data sets used in the experiments are typically too 615 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 small to obtain a generalizable result . Another issue is that many data sets created to evaluate individual methods were designed for a speciﬁc task , focusing on a par - ticular type of metaphor and using an annotation scheme of their own . This makes the results not directly comparable and the overall performance landscape difﬁcult to interpret . This situation calls for the consolidation of the insights gained from the current experiments into a single task deﬁnition and the creation of a large data set with this task in mind . Ideally , the systems should be evaluated on an expert - annotated corpus , containing continuous , general - domain text . In order to be indica - tive of the likely performance of the system on real - world data , the corpus needs to have a comprehensive coverage of registers and genres . Finally , a large corpus anno - tated for metaphor would enable reliable evaluation both in terms of precision and recall . The work of Dunn ( 2013b ) was exemplary in that he evaluated and compared four different methods on the same data set . Dunn used the VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus ( Steen et al . 2010 ) , which is currently the largest metaphor corpus in existence , containing approximately 200 , 000 words . However , because Steen and colleagues were interested in historical aspects of metaphor along with its use in modern language , the VU metaphor corpus contains a large proportion of lexicalized metaphors . Their meanings are ingrained in everyday use and can be interpreted via established tech - niques ( e . g . , word sense disambiguation ) , and their metaphorical nature may or may not be of interest to wider NLP . Whether metaphor processing systems should address highly conventional and dead metaphors depends on the task and application in mind , and corpus annotation should reﬂect this task deﬁnition in a consistent way . As the ﬁeld moves forward , it would also be desirable to conduct extrinsic evaluations of the metaphor processing systems , in order to determine their usefulness for external NLP applications . One such experiment has already been carried out by Agerri ( 2008 ) , who has demonstrated that metaphor interpretation plays an important role in textual entailment resolution . 8 . Conclusion Metaphor makes our thoughts move vivid and enriches our communication with novel imagery , but most importantly it plays a fundamental structural role in our cognition , helping us organize and project knowledge . As a result , its manifestations are pervasive in language and reasoning , making its computational processing an imperative task within NLP and intelligent systems engineering at large . Despite involving complex comparisons and information transfers , metaphor is a well - structured and system - atic phenomenon , highly suitable for computational modeling . Focusing primarily on linguistic metaphor , the community has investigated a range of its aspects , imple - mented in a variety of system features . Among the most successful features are con - creteness , distributional behavior of source and target domain vocabulary , selectional preferences , textual coherence , and topical properties of source and target words . The ﬁeld has evolved from the widespread use of hand - coded knowledge to mainly data - driven research . Balanced corpora , the Web , Wikipedia and , sometimes , domain - speciﬁc corpora have become the primary source of knowledge for metaphor processing . The community has investigated supervised learning , clustering , topic modeling , and pattern - based search to acquire lexical , relational , and domain knowledge from these corpora . Yielding promising results , this was a signiﬁcant advance in computational modeling of metaphor , allowing for the application of the systems to real - world data . 616 Shutova Design and Evaluation of Metaphor Processing Systems These experiments also provided new insights on the behavior of metaphor across domains , genres , and types of discourse . The research on mining metaphorical associations from the data sheds light on how metaphors structure our conceptual system , as well as how speciﬁc conceptual metaphors are realized in language , revealing new information about their cognitive processing . Large - scale , automatic identiﬁcation of conceptual metaphor thus pro - vides a bridge between computational and cognitive research in this area , and has a wider scientiﬁc relevance beyond NLP . An interdisciplinary approach , leveraging knowledge from linguistics , cognitive science , psychology , neuroscience , and com - puter science , would be well - positioned to advance our understanding of metaphor - ical mechanisms and take the performance of metaphor processing systems to the next level . Two areas that are particularly likely to beneﬁt from an interdisciplinary approach are metaphorical inference and extended metaphor , which have so far es - caped attention in NLP . Recent advances in processing linguistic and conceptual metaphor , however , bring us a step closer to understanding and modeling these phenomena . Despite the promising experimental results reported by the community , little attention has yet been given to real - world applications of metaphor processing . Possible applications include other semantic tasks within NLP and data mining , as well as social science and educational applications . Within NLP , most applications that need to access semantic knowledge would beneﬁt from robust and accurate metaphor resolution . These include , for instance , machine translation , sentiment anal - ysis , or text classiﬁcation . Because the metaphors we use are known to be indica - tive of our underlying viewpoints , metaphor processing is likely to be fruitful in determining political afﬁliation from text or pinning down cross - cultural and cross - population differences , and thus become a useful tool in data mining . In social sci - ence , metaphor is extensively studied as a way to frame cultural and moral models , and to predict social choice ( Landau , Sullivan , and Greenberg 2009 ; Thibodeau and Boroditsky 2011 ; Lakoff and Wehling 2012 ) . Metaphor is also widely viewed as a creative tool . Its knowledge projection mechanisms help us to grasp new concepts and generate innovative ideas . This opens many avenues for the creation of compu - tational tools that foster creativity ( Veale 2011 , 2014 ) and support assessment in educa - tion ( Burstein et al . 2013 ) . The design of the metaphor processing task should thus be informed by the possible applications . The application in mind may place particular requirements on the types of metaphor the system needs to address and the output representations it is expected to produce . Whereas an NLP application , such as machine translation , would be primarily concerned with linguistic metaphors and , possibly , the more cre - ative instances thereof , a data mining application , aiming to detect a set of trends , may ﬁnd the identiﬁcation of conceptual metaphors prominent in the data more in - formative . The formulation of the task and experimental design , in turn , predeter - mine how system performance is best evaluated . So far , the lack of a common task deﬁnition and a shared data set have hampered our progress as a community in this area . This calls for a uniﬁcation of the task deﬁnition and a large - scale anno - tation effort that would provide a data set for metaphor system evaluation , built with the insights gained from the present studies . The main purpose of this paper is to provide a platform for debate that would assist us in formulating the overall goals of metaphor processing and devising an optimal experimental strategy , enabling us as a community to make signiﬁcant progress in this important and fascinating area . 617 Computational Linguistics Volume 41 , Number 4 References Agerri , Rodrigo . 2008 .
