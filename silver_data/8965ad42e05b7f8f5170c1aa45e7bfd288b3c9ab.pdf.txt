Michael Bishop , February 12 , 1998 ABSTRACT The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src is ex - pressed at a high level in cells that are specialized for regulated secretion , such as the neuron , and is concentrated on secretory vesicles or at the site of exocytosis . To investigate the possibility that Src may play a role in regulating mem - brane traffic , we searched for neuronal proteins that will interact with Src . The SH3 domain of Src , but not that of the splice variant N - Src , bound to three proteins from mouse synaptosomes or PC12 cells : dynamin , synapsin Ia , and syn - apsin Ib . Dynamin and the synapsins coprecipitated with Src from PC12 cell extracts , and they colocalized with a subset of Src in the PC12 cell by immunofluorescence . Neither dynamin nor the synapsins were phosphorylated by Src , suggesting that the interaction of these proteins serves to direct the kinase activity of Src toward other proteins in the vesicle population . In immunoprecipitates containing Src and dynamin , the clathrin adaptor protein a - adaptin was also found . The association of Src and synapsin suggests a role for Src in the life cycle of the synaptic vesicle . The identification of a complex containing Src , dynamin , and a - adaptin indicates that Src may play a more general role in membrane traffic as well . The Src protein is the archetype for a family of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases ( 1 ) . Src is expressed at a low level in many cell types , but it is expressed at a high level in certain cells that are specialized for regulated secretion , including neurons , endocrine cells , platelets , and osteoclasts ( 2 , 3 ) . The subcel - lular localization of Src corresponds to organelles involved in membrane traffic , such as the endosome ( 4 , 5 ) , the synaptic vesicle ( 6 ) , and the secretory granule ( 7 ) . Neurons express both Src itself and a neuron - specific splice variant , N - Src ( 8 , 9 ) . Therefore , Src may play a regulatory role in membrane traffic events that are particularly critical in the neuron . Src interacts with proline - rich domains of other proteins by means of a domain known as SH3 ( 1 ) . Using an in vitro binding assay , we found that the SH3 domain of Src , but not of N - Src , interacts with three known proline - rich proteins : dynamin , synapsin Ia , and synapsin Ib . Moreover , both immunofluores - cence and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that these pro - teins interact in vivo . In addition , the clathrin assembly protein a - adaptin , which had previously been shown to bind to dy - namin , coprecipitated with Src . These protein associations suggest a role for Src in membrane traffic events mediated by dynamin and the synapsins in the neuron . While this manu - script was in preparation , Onofri et al . ( 10 ) reported that the SH3 domain of Src interacts with the synapsins and that the association of Src and synapsin results in stimulation of the kinase activity of Src ( see Discussion ) .

The samples were blocked for 15 min in 10 % normal goat serum ( PBS y NGS ) , then incubated with primary anti - body for 1 . 5 hr . Washing with PBS y NGS was followed by a 30 - min incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated to the red fluorophore Cy3 ( Molecular Probes ) .

To identify proteins from the neuron that would interact with Src , SH3 domains of Src and N - Src ( SrcSH3 and NSrcSH3 , respectively ) were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion proteins and used as probes in an overlay assay . Equal amounts of solubilized protein from a membrane preparation of PC12 cells or from a synaptosome preparation of mouse brain were probed with the GST fusion proteins . The SrcSH3 fusion protein , but not the NSrcSH3 fusion protein , bound to three proteins , approximately 100 , 80 , and 75 kDa , in prepa - rations of mouse brain synaptosomes ( Fig . 1 A ) . The same three bands were detected in a small vesicle fraction from PC12 cells . These three proteins comigrated with three known proteins identified by specific antibodies : dynamin and synapsins Ia and Ib ( Fig . 1 B ) . Src , the Synapsins , and Dynamin Colocalize in PC12 Cells . Src , dynamin , and the synapsins have been previously reported to be enriched in nerve terminals from brain ( 6 , 13 , 14 ) . We compared the immunofluorescent staining patterns of these proteins in PC12 cells . The immunofluorescent staining pattern of Src in PC12 cells included a bright perinuclear staining ( Fig . 2 A ) as well as a punctate staining pattern throughout the neurites ( Fig . 2 B ) . The cell body staining patterns of dynamin ( Fig . 2 C ) and the synapsins ( Fig . 2 E ) in PC12 cells were less intense than that of Src . Instead , in these cells , the staining patterns in the neurite predominated . The neurite staining of dynamin in PC12 cells ( Fig . 2 D ) was very similar to that of Src . The neurites were intensely stained in a punctate pattern . The neurite staining of the synapsins in PC12 cells ( Fig . 2 F ) was also quite intense , but it exhibited less of a punctate character than Src or dynamin . The staining patterns of a predominantly endosomal pro - tein , transferrin ( Fig . 2 G ) , and a cytoplasmic protein , pyruvate kinase ( Fig . 2 H ) , differed dramatically from those of Src , F IG . 1 . Mouse synaptosome proteins that interact with the SH3 domain of Src . ( A ) Mouse brain synaptosomes were lysed , resolved by electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel , and used in an overlay assay with the indicated GST fusion proteins ( GST , GST alone ; SH3 , GSTSrcSH3 ; NSH3 , GSTNSrcSH3 ) . ( B ) The same preparation was Western blotted with antibodies to dynamin and synapsins Ia and Ib . F IG . 2 . Immunofluorescence patterns of Src , dynamin , and the synapsins in PC12 cells . PC12 cells were induced to differentiate with nerve growth factor and were prepared for immunofluorescence with antibodies to the following proteins : Src ( A and B ) , dynamin ( C and D ) , synapsin I ( E and F ) , the transferrin receptor ( G ) , and pyruvate kinase ( H ) .

USA 95 ( 1998 ) dynamin , and the synapsins . Antibodies to transferrin and pyruvate kinase did not stain the neurites of differentiated PC12 cells at all ( Fig . 2 G and H ) . In contrast , antibodies to Src , dynamin , and the synapsins stained the neurites intensely . Therefore , a subset of the total Src in the PC12 cell colocalizes with dynamin and the synapsins . We were unable to perform double - label immunofluorescence on PC12 cells with the available antibodies . Dynamin and Synapsins Ia and b Coprecipitate with Src from PC12 Cell Lysates . To determine whether the interac - tions detected between Src , dynamin , and the synapsins in vitro were physiologically relevant , we assessed the association of the proteins in PC12 cells . Lysates of PC12 cells were prepared and analyzed by immunoprecipitation with normal rabbit serum or an antibody to Src , followed by Western blotting for dynamin and the synapsins ( Fig . 3 A and B ) . Both dynamin and the synapsins were precipitated reproducibly by a number of different Src - specific antibodies , but not by normal rabbit serum . These results were the same in untreated and fully differentiated PC12 cells ( not shown ) . Dynamin coprecipitated with Src from a fibroblast cell line , indicating that this interaction was not limited to neuronal cell types ( Fig . 3 C ) . The synapsins are not expressed in nonneu - ronal cell types . When an antibody to Src was used in a precipitation from a src 2 y 2 cell lysate , dynamin was not precipitated ( Fig . 3 C ) . Thus , the coprecipitation of dynamin with Src was not an artifact of antibody cross - reactivity , but rather required the presence of the Src protein . We were unable to detect tyrosine phosphorylation on dynamin or the synapsins in PC12 cell lysate by using several appropriate techniques ( not shown ) . The Interaction Between Src and Dynamin and the Syn - apsins Is Specific and Direct . To exclude the possibility that the coprecipitation of dynamin and the synapsins with Src was the result of an artifactual precipitation of whole synaptic vesicles or other membranes , two approaches were taken . First , all lysates were subjected to a high speed centrifugation that was sufficient to sediment synaptic vesicles , and should remove any poorly solubilized membranes prior to immunoprecipita - tion . Second , the Src immunoprecipitate was tested for the presence of other synaptic vesicle , endosome , or coated vesicle antigens . Lysates were immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit serum or the Src antibody . Whole cell lysates and the immu - noprecipitates were then Western blotted with antibodies to a number of abundant synaptic vesicle proteins and proteins found on endosomes and coated vesicles . None of the antigens tested was detectable in the Src immunoprecipitate from at least 10 - fold more lysate than was required for detection of the antigen by Western blotting ( data summarized in Table 1 ) . These results indicate that the membranes in the PC12 lysates were likely to be fully solubilized , and that dynamin and the synapsins were not precipitating nonspecifically . The as - sociations of dynamin and the synapsins were therefore the result of specific and direct interactions of these proteins with Src . a - Adaptin Coprecipitates with Src . Dynamin binds to Grb2 , phospholipase C - g , and a - adaptin ( 15 – 20 ) . We tested for the presence of these proteins in the Src immunoprecipitate from PC12 cells ( Table 1 ) . Neither Grb2 nor phospholipase C - g was detected in the Src immunoprecipitates . Although complexes containing Grb2 and dynamin may exist in PC12 cells , the complex containing Src and dynamin is apparently different . We were able to detect an association of Src and a - adaptin in PC12 cell lysates ( Fig . 4 A ) . As a control , we checked for the association of a related adaptor protein , g - adaptin , that is not expected to be enriched in the nerve terminal . We were unable to detect g - adaptin in our immunoprecipitates , indicating that the association with a - adaptin is specific ( Fig . 4 B ) . We found no evidence for a direct interaction between the SrcSH3 fusion protein and a - adaptin ( not shown ) . It is likely that the presence of a - adaptin in the immunoprecipitate is a result of binding to dynamin ( 20 ) . Despite the presence of the adaptor protein , we were unable to detect clathrin in the immunoprecipitates . Other Src Family Members Do Not Bind to Dynamin in Neuronal Cells . Because of the similarity in the sequences and the subcellular localization of Src family members in PC12 cells , we looked for the association of other endogenously expressed Src family members with dynamin . Dynamin failed to coprecipitate with Fyn and Yes from PC12 cell lysate ( Fig . 5 A ) or mouse synaptosomes ( not shown ) .

USA 95 ( 1998 ) 4675 cross - reacts with Fyn and Yes confirmed that the Src family member proteins were precipitated by their specific antibodies ( Fig . 5 B ) . Similar results were obtained when the immunopre - cipitates were Western blotted for synapsin ( not shown ) , suggesting that this interaction was also unique to Src in the neuron . To determine the effect of loss of Src expression on the other Src family members in neurons , we analyzed the expression level of other Src family members and their ability to associate with dynamin in preparations of brain from src 2 y 2 mice . We found no change in the expression level of other Src family members in src 2 y 2 brain preparations . In addition , we found no evidence for a compensatory change in the ability of other Src family members to associate with dynamin in the absence of Src ( not shown ) . DISCUSSION A Role for Src in Neuronal Membrane Traffic . There is mounting evidence to suggest a role for Src in membrane traffic . Src is expressed at a high level in a variety of cell types that are specialized for regulated secretion , including the neuron ( 2 ) . In these cells , Src is concentrated on the organelles involved in exocytosis or endocytosis , such as the synaptic vesicle in neurons and the endosome in fibroblasts ( 4 – 6 ) . Overexpression of Src in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells leads to an increased secretory response to acetylcholine receptor stimulation ( 21 ) . Stenberg et al . ( 22 ) have recently shown that some Src family members colocalize with clathrin in coated pits and vesicles in the platelet . We and Onofri et al . ( 10 ) have now shown that Src interacts with dynamin and the synapsins , proteins known to be involved in membrane regulation in the nerve terminal . In addition we find that Src interacts indirectly with the clathrin adaptor protein , a - adaptin . Dynamin is a GTPase involved in the final steps of fission of a clathrin - coated vesicle from the membrane , and it may be involved in other , clathrin - independent , types of endocytosis . Dynamin plays an important role in receptor - mediated endo - cytosis in a variety of cells and in synaptic vesicle recycling in neurons ( 14 , 23 – 25 ) . SH3 domain - containing proteins , such as Grb2 and amphiphysin , are thought to recruit dynamin to the plasma membrane ( 26 , 27 ) . Shupliakov et al . ( 28 ) have blocked synaptic vesicle recycling in neurons with the injection of a bacterially expressed SH3 domain from amphiphysin or a peptide consisting of the proline - rich sequence of dynamin . Since we found that Src and dynamin interact in neurons and nonneuronal cells , Src may play a role similar to that hypoth - esized for amphiphysin and Grb2 in neurons and possibly in other cell types . a - Adaptin is an assembly protein that is involved in recruit - ing clathrin to the plasma membrane ( 29 ) . Like dynamin , a - adaptin plays a role in both receptor - mediated endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling ( 30 ) . The interaction of Src and a - adaptin in vivo suggests a role for Src in the regulation of the endocytic process in neurons . The synapsins are neuron - specific proteins that bind both to the synaptic vesicle and to actin . The binding is thought to cross - link a subpopulation of synaptic vesicles , known as the reserve pool , to an actin cytomatrix in the nerve terminal ( 31 – 33 ) . Activation of a signal transduction pathway leading to the phosphorylation of synapsin on serine residues by CamKi - nase II is required for release of synaptic vesicles from this reserve pool ( 13 , 34 – 37 ) . The interaction of Src with the synapsins suggests that Src might play a role in regulating the formation , stability , or dissolution of this actin - bound popu - lation of synaptic vesicles . Despite the fact that dynamin and the synapsins coprecipi - tated with Src , we have no evidence that the proteins were tyrosine - phosphorylated in PC12 cells . Neither protein was recognized by an anti - phosphotyrosine antibody when copre - cipitated with Src or when immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody to dynamin or the synapsins from whole cell lysate . Neither protein became phosphorylated in an in vitro kinase assay using Src immunoprecipitates . There is no published evidence for the tyrosine phosphorylation of the synapsins . Dynamin is tyrosine - phosphorylated and associated with the Lyn tyrosine kinase in resting mast cells , but becomes dephos - phorylated when mast cells are stimulated to degranulate ( 38 ) . Although dynamin and the synapsins appear not to be sub - strates for Src , the interaction with synapsin stimulates the kinase activity of Src ( 10 ) . We sought but failed to find such stimulation , possibly because of idiosyncrasies of our serolog - ical reagents . Other Src Family Members in Neurons Do Not Bind to Dynamin or the Synapsins . Whereas antibodies to Src copre - cipitated dynamin and the synapsins , antibodies to other Src family members expressed in neurons failed to coprecipitate these proteins . The fact that the protein interactions observed here seem to be unique to Src suggests that , at least in this case , the Src family members are not redundant . In addition , we have found that there is no direct compensatory activity of the other Src family members present in a src 2 y 2 mouse . To date , there are no reports of defects in the function of differentiated neurons from the brain of src 2 y 2 mice . Pre - viously , this had been explained by the possible redundant or compensatory functions of other Src family members . Our results require alternative explanations . It is possible that F IG . 4 . a - Adaptin coprecipitates with Src from PC12 cells . PC12 cells were lysed and prepared by immunoprecipitation with NRS or Src antibody . Whole cell lysate ( WCL ) and the immunoprecipitates were Western blotted with antibodies to a - adaptin ( A ) and g - adaptin ( B ) . F IG . 5 . Association of dynamin with other Src family members . PC12 cells were lysed and prepared for immunoprecipitation with NRS and antibodies to Src , Fyn , and Yes . The immunoprecipitates were Western blotted with an antibody to dynamin ( A ) and with a pan - Src - family antiserum ( B ) . 4676 Neurobiology : Foster - Barber and Bishop Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 95 ( 1998 ) other , unrelated , proteins play the same role as Src in the neuron . Alternatively , Src may play a role in the neuron that is not essential for normal function . N - Src May Play a Different Role Than Src in Neurons . The NSrcSH3 domain contains an insert of six amino acids in the region responsible for binding to the polyproline sequence . This insert has been previously shown to change the binding specificity of the SH3 domain , preventing N - Src from binding to many of the proteins to which Src binds ( 39 ) . Accordingly , the SH3 domain of N - Src failed to bind the proline - rich domains of dynamin and the synapsins . This result sustains the conclusion that the association of dynamin and the synapsins with the SH3 domain of Src is most likely mediated by an interaction with polyproline sequences . Onofri et al . ( 10 ) have substantiated this view by mapping the interaction to a car - boxyl - terminal domain of synapsin that contains two canonical binding sites for the SH3 domain of Src . Most neurons of the central nervous system express both the Src and N - Src proteins ( 8 , 9 ) . If the neuronal variant of Src is not involved in interactions with dynamin and the synapsins , then perhaps it plays a different role in the cell . The insert within the SH3 domain of N - Src might serve to free N - Src from some protein associations , allowing it to bind to other proteins specifically expressed in the neuron .
