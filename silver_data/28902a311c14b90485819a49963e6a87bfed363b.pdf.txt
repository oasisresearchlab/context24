Introduction Cytokinesis , the final stage of cell division , depends on the as - sembly and constriction of a contractile ring of actin filaments , myosin - II , formins , and many other proteins . Here we focus on the actin binding protein cofilin , which concentrates in the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis in animal cells ( Nagaoka et al . , 1995 ) and is required in some way for cytokinesis in a va - riety of organisms including nematodes ( Ono et al . , 2003 ) , fruit flies ( Gunsalus et al . , 1995 ) , frogs ( Abe et al . , 1996 ) and fission yeast ( Nakano and Mabuchi , 2006 ) . Analysis of cytokinesis is favorable in fission yeast , thanks to the most complete genetic inventory of participating proteins ( Bathe and Chang , 2010 ; Pollard and Wu , 2010 ) . Cofilin is es - sential for the viability of fission yeast and depletion of the native protein or replacement of the adf1 + gene with a tempera - ture sensitive mutation ( adf1 - 1 ) results in defects in contractile ring assembly and stability ( Nakano and Mabuchi , 2006 ; note , Nakano and Mabuchi named the single cofilin gene in fission yeast adf1 + for actin depolymerizing factor , the original name of this family [ Bamburg et al . , 1980 ] . We retain this gene name but call the protein cofilin , a later name [ Nishida et al . , 1984 ] , because these proteins sever but do not depolymerize actin fila - ments [ Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ; Pavlov et al . , 2007 ; Chan et al . , 2009 ] ) . However , these observations of fixed cells did not reveal why contractile ring assembly fails in adf1 - 1 cells , nor were the cofilin mutants characterized biochemically , leaving open questions about mechanisms . A simple search - capture - pull and release model explains many features of contractile ring assembly in fission yeast ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) . The model postulates that myosin - II , located in precursor structures called nodes , captures actin fila - ments growing from formins in neighboring nodes and pulls the nodes together . Short - lived connections between nodes explain their motions and are required to form contractile rings in com - puter simulations because stable connections between nodes produce clumps of nodes rather than a continuous ring . Two mechanisms were proposed to break connections between nodes : either myosin - II might dissociate from the connecting actin fila - ments owing to its low processivity ; or the connecting actin fila - ments might break . Live cell microscopy with fluorescence W e created two new mutants of fission yeast co - filin to investigate why cytokinesis in many organisms depends on this small actin - binding protein . These mutant cofilins bound actin monomers nor - mally , but bound and severed ADP - actin filaments much slower than wild - type cofilin . Cells depending on mutant cofilins condensed nodes , precursors of the contractile ring , into clumps rather than rings . Starting from clumped nodes , mutant cells slowly assembled rings from diverse intermediate structures including spiral strands containing actin filaments and other contractile ring proteins . This process in mutant cells depended on  - actinin . These slowly assembled contractile rings constricted at a normal rate but with more variability , indicating ring constriction is not very sensitive to defects in severing by cofilin . Com - puter simulations of the search - capture - pull and release model of contractile ring formation predicted that nodes clump when the release step is slow , so cofilin severing of actin filament connections between nodes likely contrib - utes to the release step . Actin filament severing by cofilin is more important for assembly than constriction of the cytokinetic contractile ring Qian Chen 1 and Thomas D .

S1 B , Video 1 ) , but adf1 - 1 cells developed contractile ring defects within 5 min of shifting to the restrictive temperature . Shifting adf1 - 1 cells with broad bands of nodes to 36°C caused the nodes to coalesce into clumps within 10 min rather than forming continuous contractile rings ( Fig . S1 C , Video 2 ) . Interpretation of the phenotype of the adf1 - 1 mutant re - quired information about the biochemical properties of adf1 - 1 cofilin , so we attempted to purify recombinant adf1 - 1 cofilin L57S from bacteria . The protein was insoluble in low salt buffer , which precluded purification . Localization of cofilin during cytokinesis GFP - cofilin concentrated with actin filaments in endocytic actin patches and contractile rings ( Fig . S1 ) as observed previ - ously ( Nakano and Mabuchi , 2006 ) , but did not accumulate directly in nodes early in the process of cytokinesis ( Fig . S1 ) . GFP - cofilin was abundant in the broad band of nodes but spread diffusely between the nodes during contractile ring assembly ( Fig . S1 , E and F ) . Overexpression of GFP - cofilin from either the strong ADH promoter or 3nmt1 promoter was required to complement deletion of adf1 + because cells de - pending on GFP - cofilin expressed from the endogenous adf1 promoter were not viable ( unpublished data ) . Therefore , as in budding yeast ( Okreglak and Drubin , 2007 ) , GFP - cofilin is not fully functional in fission yeast . Construction of new cofilin mutants We created new cofilin mutants that are useful for both bio - chemical and cellular studies . We based seven fission yeast cofilin mutants ( Table I ) on three temperature - sensitive alanine substitution mutants of budding yeast cofilin ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . We integrated these mutations into the endogenous cofilin locus in a diploid strain , with one copy of wild - type adf1 + . Tetrad analysis showed that haploid cells depending on six of the cofilin mutants were viable even at high temperature ( Table I ) , so these mutations were not temperature sensitive . We focused on adf1 - M2 and adf1 - M3 , which had the most serious growth defects ( Fig . 1 , A and B ; Table I ) . The mutations markers on both myosin - II and actin filaments provided evi - dence for both mechanisms ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) . We tested the hypothesis that the role of cofilin in cyto - kinesis is to sever actin filaments during assembly of contrac - tile rings . Our initial observations of the temperature - sensitive cofilin adf1 - 1 strain by fluorescence microscopy of live cells showed that precursors called nodes failed to condense into a contractile ring at the restrictive temperature . The adf1 - 1 cofilin protein ( L57S ) was not sufficiently stable to purify , so we created seven new mutations based on temperature - sensitive mutations of budding yeast cofilin ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . Two of these mutant cofilins were defective in binding and severing actin filaments . Experiments with these two cofilins in live cells revealed that the actin filament severing by cofilin is crucial for the normal assembly and stability of the contrac - tile ring . Cells depending on a mutant cofilin failed to assem - ble a contractile ring directly from a broad band of precursor nodes , but most of these cells eventually formed contractile rings via a slow , unreliable process depending on the actin fila - ment cross - linking protein  - actinin , similar to that observed in cells lacking anillin Mid1p . The cofilin mutations had only subtle effects on constriction of contractile rings , in spite of the difficulties during assembly . Results Contractile ring defects in cells with a temperature - sensitive cofilin mutation We used fluorescence microscopy to characterize the pheno - type of live adf1 - 1 cells expressing a triple GFP - tag on the myosin - II regulatory light chain ( Rlc1p - 3GFP ) to mark the contractile ring and its precursors ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) . At 25°C adf1 - 1 cells were indistinguishable from wild - type cells . Both strains grew at the same rate . Both concentrated Rlc1p - 3GFP in punctate cortical structures called nodes starting 10 min before spindle pole body separation , time zero in the cellular time frame defined by Wu et al . ( 2003 ) . Beginning at time + 1 min , nodes in both strains condensed over 10 min into a contractile ring that began to constrict at the same rate  30 min later ( Fig . S1 A ) . Table I .

S2 C and 1 C ) showed that wild - type cofilin , cofilin - M2 , and cofilin - M3 all have K d s of  0 . 1 µM for binding monomeric actin ( Table II ) . Therefore , the cellular de - fects caused by these cofilin mutations are unlikely a result from defects in binding to actin monomers . Both cofilin mutants had selective defects in actin filament binding and severing . In equilibrium binding exper - iments , where cofilin quenched the fluorescence of pyrenyl - actin filaments in proportion to binding ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) , plots of fluorescence vs . concentration of free cofilin were sig - moidal ( Fig . 1 D ) . Analysis of these binding data with the De La Cruz application ( De La Cruz , 2005 ) of an unlimited nearest - neighbor cooperativity model ( McGhee and von Hippel , 1974 ; Kowalczykowski et al . , 1986 ) gave apparent K d s of 1 . 7 µM for cofilin - M2 , 0 . 89 µM for cofilin - M3 , and 0 . 34 µM for wild - type cofilin , the latter close to previous work ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) . Both cofilins M2 and M3 bound to pyrenyl - actin filaments slower than wild - type cofilin ( Fig . 1 E ) . Cooperativity makes these reactions more complicated than a simple bimolecular re - action , so single exponentials fit the time courses even though the conditions were not pseudo - first order ( Chan et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore , slopes of the linear plots of observed rate constants vs . cofilin concentration ( Fig . 1 E  ) are apparent association rate constants ( Table II ) . As noted for wild - type cofilins , the ratios in adf1 - M3 ( E132A , K133A ) are located near the C terminus of cofilin . The corresponding residues are part of the interface between the twinfillin C - terminal ADH domain and actin monomer in a cocrystal structure ( Paavilainen et al . , 2008 ) , so the mutations might directly compromise binding . The muta - tions in adf1 - M2 ( K23A , S24A , R25A ) are in a loop on the opposite side of cofilin and not expected to interact directly with either an actin monomer or subunits in an actin filament ( Paavilainen et al . , 2008 ) . Similar to adf1 - 1 cells at the restrictive temperature ( Nakano and Mabuchi , 2006 ) , adf1 - M2 and adf1 - M3 mutations were synthetically lethal with deletion mutations of actin - interacting protein 1 aip1 + at 25°C ( Table I ) , consistent with the behavior of budding yeast cofilin mutants ( Rodal et al . , 1999 ) . On the other hand , our cofilin mutants were not synthetically lethal with temperature - sensitive tropomyosin mutant cdc8 - 27 at the permissive temperature ( Table I ) . Biochemical characterization of cofilin mutants cofilin - M2 and cofilin - M3 We characterized the biochemical properties of cofilin - M2 and cofilin - M3 purified from bacteria ( Fig . S2 A ) . Cofilin - M3 is slightly more stable to urea denaturation than the wild - type pro - tein , whereas cofilin - M2 is slightly less stable ( Table II ; Fig . S2 B ) . Cells grew normally when dependent on cofilin - M1 ( Fig . 1 A ) , a mutant with stability similar to cofilin - M2 ( unpublished data ) . Figure 1 .

In spite of these difficulties most mutant cells completed cytokinesis , so < 1 % of interphase mutant cells had two nuclei . On the other hand , many binucleate cells accumulated during the greatly prolonged cytokinesis ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . To investigate the defects in contractile ring assembly in cofilin mutant cells , we looked closely at the behavior of the precursors , nodes of proteins , which normally coalesce into a contractile ring ( Wu et al . , 2006 ; Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) . Wild - type and cofilin mutant cells initiated contrac - tile rings starting from similar numbers of nodes ( Fig . S3 E ) located in broad bands around the equator and containing myosin - II , formin Cdc12p , and F - BAR protein Cdc15p . Dur - ing ring assembly in both wild - type and cofilin mutant cells these nodes became enmeshed in a network of actin fila - ments ( Fig . S3 F ) . When actin filaments first appeared at time + 1 min ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) , nodes began moving in both wild - type ( Fig . 4 A ; Video 5 ) and cofilin mutant cells ( Fig . 4 , B and C ; Videos 6 and 7 ) , resulting in the nodes coalescing into a ring in  10 min in wild - type cells ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) , but form - ing one or more large , highly fluorescent clump in cofilin mutant cells ( Fig . 4 , B – E ; Videos 6 and 7 ) . We defined clumps as bright accumulations of Rlc1p - 3GFP that were stationary for at least 120 s after the time that nodes started to move because nodes and small accumulations of nodes rarely pause > 60 s in wild - type cells ( Video 5 ) . Nodes formed clumps in adf1 - M2 cells in  300 s ( 291 ± 92 s , n = 7 ) from the point when they started to move . As they grew in size , clumps attracted nearby nodes ( Fig . 4 , D and E ) . We counted the numbers of clumps that were stationary for ≥10 min in cofilin mutant cells : 81 % of adf1 - M2 cells and 62 % of adf1 - M3 cells had 1 or 2 such clumps , whereas the other cells had more ( Fig . 5 A ) . Nodes in adf1 - 1 cells also condensed into clumps at the restrictive tempera - ture ( Fig . S3 G ) . We tracked the movements of nodes marked with Rlc1p - 3GFP at 1 - s intervals in a confocal section of the top of cells at 25°C to understand the defects in cofilin mutant cells . Nodes moved at the same velocity in wild - type and adf1 - M2 cells and in adf1 - M3 cells ( Fig . 5 B and Table IV ) . However , nodes in of k  / k + disagree with the K d s measured under equilibrium conditions and indicate that M2 is more disabled for filament binding than revealed by the other parameters . Cofilin - M2 also dissociates slower from actin filaments than wild - type cofilin and cofilin - M3 ( Fig . S2 D ) . Real - time observations by total internal reflection fluor - escence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( Fig . S2 E ) showed that the cofilin mutants were defective at severing actin filaments ( Fig . 1 F ) . The severing activity of cofilin - M2 peaked around 500 nM and cofilin - M3 around 100 nM , whereas severing was optimal with 10 nM wild - type cofilin ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) . Even at its optimal concentration , cofilin - M2 severed filaments far slower than cofilin - M3 , which was also slower than wild - type cofilin ( Fig . 1 F and Table II ) . Effects of low affinity cofilins on contractile ring assembly Cells dependent on cofilin - M2 or cofilin - M3 had defects in morphology and septation ( Fig . 2 A ) . Cofilin mutant cells were 30 % larger in diameter but about normal in length ( Fig . S3 , A and B ) . Many cofilin mutant cells had two or more nuclei , in - dicating a defect in cell division ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . Staining fixed cells with Bodipy - phallacidin showed thick strands con - taining actin filaments near the equators of many cofilin mutant cells ( Fig . 2 D ) . Wild - type cells rarely had such strands . These phenotypes are likely to be due to the biochemical defects of these mutant cofilins rather than expression problems because cells expressed cofilin - M2 or cofilin - M3 at levels similar to wild - type cofilin ( Fig . S3 C ) . Contractile ring assembly was much slower and more variable in cells depending on mutant cofilins than in wild - type cells ( Fig . 3 , A – D ; Videos 3 and 4 ) . Spindle pole bodies marked with Sad1p - GFP allowed us to align all of the cells on the same time frame ( Wu et al . , 2003 ) , while Rlc1p - 3GFP marked nodes and contractile rings . Wild - type cells condensed broad bands of nodes into rings in 10 . 2 ± 1 . 7 min ( mean ± SD ; n = 31 ; Fig . 3 B ) at 25°C , but adf1 - M2 cells required an average of 52 . 1 ± 29 . 1 min ( n = 30 ) and adf1 - M3 cells took 21 . 5 ± 18 . 0 min ( n = 42 ; Table III ) . 15 min after the separation of SPBs , every wild - type cell had a complete contractile ring compared with just 17 % of Table II .

Strands composed of contractile ring proteins ( actin [ Fig . 2 D ] , myosin - II [ Fig . 6 A ] , Cdc15p [ Fig . 6 B ] , and Cdc12p [ Fig . 6 C ] ) emerged from clumps of nodes and slowly organized into few long bundles ( Video 8 ) , which then slowly compacted into a contractile ring ( Figs . 3 C and 6 D ; Videos 4 and 9 ) . Contractile ring assembly in cofilin mutant cells was more dependent than wild - type cells on the actin filament cross - linking protein  - actinin . Deletion of the  - actinin ain1 + gene had little effect on cytokinesis in otherwise normal fission yeast cells ( Wu et al . , 2001 ; Fig . S5 A ) . Similar to wild - type cells ,  ain1 cells assembled complete contractile rings in 24 . 7 ± 3 . 6 min ( n = 25 ) after Myo2 appeared in nodes . However ,  ain1 adf1 - M2 double - mutant cells are much sicker than either adf1 - M2 or  ain1 cells ( Fig . S5 B ) . Although less than 1 % of  ain1 or adf1 - M2 cells had two interphase nuclei , 7 . 7 % of  ain1 adf1 - M2 double - mutant cells had two or more interphase nuclei ( Fig . S5 C ; n = 225 ) resulting from failures of cytokinesis . Live cell imaging showed that  ain1 adf1 - M2 cells frequently failed cofilin mutant cells moved longer total distances over longer times between pauses ( Fig . 5 , C and D , Table IV ) : 27 % of nodes in adf1 - M2 cells moved for > 30 s , compared with only 5 % in wild - type cells ( Fig . 5 C and Table IV ) . Monte Carlo simulations of contractile ring assembly by the search - capture - pull and release mechanism ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) correctly predicted that long - lived actin filament connec - tions between nodes result in clumping of nodes ( Fig . S11 in Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) . The relevant parameter in the model is  break , the lifetime of connections between neighboring nodes . In the cells we studied  break was estimated to be 14 s in wild - type cells , 26 s in adf1 - M2 cells , and 23 s in adf1 - M3 cells ( Table IV ) on the basis of the durations of node movements , as expected if severing of actin filaments connecting neighboring nodes contributes to pauses . In computer simulations of ring assembly ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) nodes condensed into rings with few breaks with  break = 14 s but formed clumps separated by large gaps in a few hundred seconds with  break = 26 s in either the wild - type or larger diameter of cofilin mutants ( Fig . 5 E ) . Fig . S5 illustrates the formation of clumps with larger values of  break . Increasing the cell radius by up to 30 % with native  break of 14 s had only minor effects on the assembly of rings in 600 s ( Fig . S4 B ) . Figure 2 .

Wild - type cells delayed for  30 min ( 34 ± 7 . 4 min , n = 8 ) after completing contractile ring assembly before starting to constrict the ring ( Wu et al . , 2003 ) , but contractile rings in adf1 - M2 cells began to constrict soon ( 10 ± 4 . 8 min , n = 11 ) after they formed ( Fig . 3 C ; Video 4 ) . to assemble a contractile ring , even after attempting to form rings from strands as in adf1 - M2 cells ( Fig . 6 E ) . Effects of cofilin mutants on contractile ring stability and constriction In 10 % of cofilin mutant cells ( 4 / 42 ) with complete rings , the ring fragmented and degenerated into clumps ( Fig .

In both cofilin temperature - sensitive and depletion mutants , they found defects in the assembly and maintenance of contractile rings , as well as more actin patches than in wild - type cells . They proposed At 25°C the average rate of contractile ring constriction was the same in wild - type , adf1 - M2 , and adf1 - M3 cells ( Fig . 7 E and Table III ) , but the rates of constriction were much more variable in mutant cells ( Fig . 7 , A – C ) . Pauses did not account for the slower rates because each ring constricted at a constant rate ( Fig . 7 D ) . Constricting contractile rings were homogenous in wild - type cells but were often irregular in cofilin mutant cells with thick bundles of actin filaments ( Fig . 7 F ) , which persisted throughout constriction .

S11 in that paper and Fig . 5 E in this paper ) . This agreement provides evidence for the importance of the release step in the search - capture - pull and release mechanism and shows that severing of actin filaments by cofilin contributes to the process . Dissocia - tion of the unprocessive myosin - II motor from connecting fila - ments may also contribute to the release process ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) . The cofilin mutant cells are 30 % wider than wild - type cells . However , simulations show that this alone does not cause defects in contractile ring assembly ( Fig . S5 B ) , as also observed in many fission yeast morphogenesis mutants with large diameters ( Toda et al . , 1993 , 1996 ) . Surprisingly , actin filament severing is also important for the stability of fully formed contractile rings . Contractile rings in adf1 - 1 cells broke into small fragments after shifting to the restrictive temperature . Fully formed contractile rings occasion - ally broke apart before they constricted in adf1 - M2 and adf1 - M3 cells , but never in wild - type cells . During the interval between ring formation and constriction , formin Cdc12p actively poly - merizes actin filaments ( Pelham and Chang , 2002 ) , but the mass of polymerized actin in the ring appears to be constant judging from the numbers of actin - binding proteins such as tropomyo - sin Cdc8p and  - actinin Ain1p ( Wu et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , a dis - assembly process must balance ongoing assembly . As observed in vitro ( Michelot et al . , 2007 ) , cofilin might sever off the older parts of filaments distal to the barbed end where formin cata - lyzes assembly . Additional work will be required to discover how actin filament severing paradoxically stabilizes contractile rings . One possibility is that severing by cofilin might facilitate cross - linking into stable bundles as observed in vitro ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ) . Because contractile rings disassemble as they constrict , and because cofilin was proposed to promote the turnover of actin filaments during ring constriction ( Gunsalus et al . , 1995 ; Abe et al . , 1996 ; Somma et al . , 2002 ; Kaji et al . , 2003 ; Ono et al . , 2003 ) , we were surprised to find that contractile rings constricted at the same average rates in cells with wild - type or mutant cofilins . The greater variability in constriction rates in mutant cells may result from minor mechanical de - fects that arise during the assembly of rings from strands of two mechanisms to account for the cytokinesis defects in cofilin mutant cells . First , they suggested that excess actin patches might de - plete the pool of actin monomers available to assemble con - tractile rings . Although endocytic actin patches in our cofilin mutant cells accumulated more actin filaments than normal ( Fig . 2 D ) , the networks of actin filaments around the equators of many dividing mutant cells were actually denser than in wild - type cells ( Fig . S3 F ) . Thus , the cytokinesis defects in the cofilin mutant cells do not appear to arise from a shortage of actin monomers . Second , Nakano and Mabuchi proposed that the numer - ous actin bundles in mitotic cells arose from severing defects in temperature - sensitive cofilin mutant cells at the restrictive temperature . Because cofilins sever but do not depolymerize actin filaments ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ; Pavlov et al . , 2007 ; Chan et al . , 2009 ) , we agree that severing is the most likely defect in the temperature - sensitive cofilin mutant cells . To support this interpretation , Nakano and Mabuchi used complementation experiments with yeast cofilins with point mutations previously interpreted to compromise sever - ing by porcine cofilin ( Moriyama and Yahara , 1999 ) . How - ever , they did not establish that the point mutations of fission yeast cofilin caused severing defects , an important control be - cause one cannot assume that a particular point mutation will have the same properties in a second cofilin . A further con - cern was that the assays used by Moriyama and Yahara ( 1999 ) are difficult to interpret mechanistically . Severing defects may also explain how a cofilin mutant with normal actin monomer binding caused serious defects in endocytosis in budding yeast ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . Roles for cofilin in contractile ring assembly , stability , and constriction Our new cofilin mutants provide a more definitive test of the role of actin filament severing in cytokinesis . Based on our bio - chemical characterization ( Fig . 1 ) , we interpret the effects of our mutant cofilins in cells as due exclusively to slow binding to actin filaments and low severing activity . Our experiments and computer simulations support the hypothesis that actin filament severing is required for the even condensation of nodes into a homogeneous contractile ring . Table IV .

The mechanism of contractile ring assembly is robust , so if problems arise owing to stress or defects in any of the compo - nents including cofilin , cells attempt to assemble a contractile ring from the available functional proteins and to complete cytokinesis . Cells depending on cofilin adf1 - M2 first try to precursors after the initial failure to assemble a complete ring by condensation of a broad band of nodes . Many ques - tions remain about the processes that determine the constriction rates of contractile rings , especially the relative contributions of force generation by actin and myosin - II in the contractile ring relative to growth of the primary septum , which is also required for ring constriction ( Le Goff et al . , 1999 ; Liu et al . , 2000 ) .

Thus , cells with prominent leading cables may have been stressed in some way , as hypothesized by others ( Hachet and Simanis , 2008 ; Coffman et al . , 2009 ) . A mechanism to monitor contractile ring assembly The ability of adf1 - M2 cells to persist in the cytokinesis phase for more than an hour as they assemble a physically closed con - tractile ring shows that fission yeast have a mechanism to delay both septum formation and constriction of bundles of contractile ring precursors composed of actin filaments , myosin - II , and  - actinin until the ring is complete . The ability to sense the com - pletion of a ring explains why few cofilin mutant cells have more than two nuclei during interphase despite the defects that pro - long cytokinesis . Cells with bgs1 ( cps1 ) mutations compromis - ing septum deposition and contractile ring constriction also coalesce nodes into a contractile ring , but when this fails , most mutant cells slowly assemble a contractile ring through a re - markable diversity of intermediate structures including spiral strands containing actin filaments and other contractile ring pro - teins that often anneal to form a ring . We think that wild - type and mutant cells use the same underlying biochemical reac - tions , but cofilin mutations make the process more dependent on actin filament cross - linking by  - actinin Ain1p ( Wu et al . , 2001 ) , even though the single mutant strains are viable and assemble rings ( Fig . S5 A ) . Assembly of contractile rings from strands of actin fila - ments in adf1 - M2 cells appears to be similar to strategies used by fission yeast confronted with a variety of challenges , includ - ing deletions of anillin Mid1p or polo kinase Plo1p ( Bähler et al . , 1998 ; Hachet and Simanis , 2008 ; Huang et al . , 2008 ) . Ring assembly is even less reliable without anillin Mid1p because myosin - II does not concentrate in nodes around the equator and rings assemble from widely distributed strands containing myosin - II ( Hachet and Simanis , 2008 ; Huang et al . , 2008 ) . Ring assembly in cofilin mutants is also similar to the leading cable Figure 7 . Contractile ring constriction in wild - type and cofilin mutant cells .

Ca - ATP - actin was converted to Mg - ATP - actin by incubating for at least 2 min at 25°C after adding 50 µM MgCl 2 and 0 . 2 mM EGTA to buffer G . Purified actin filaments were labeled on cysteine - 374 with pyrene iodoacetamide ( Invitrogen ) , depolymerized , clarified and gel filtrated on Sephacryl S - 300 ( GE Healthcare ; Pollard , 1984 ) . Purified actin was labeled on cysteine - 374 with Oregon Green 488 iodoacetamide mixed isomers ( Invitrogen ) , depolymerized , and purified by chromatography on columns of DEAE - Sepharose fast flow and Sephacryl S - 300 ( Kuhn and Pollard , 2005 ) . Mutant cofilins were expressed from the plasmid pMW172 in BL21 ( DE3 ) PlyS cells ( EMD ) and purified like wild - type cofilin ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) . Bacteria were induced with 1 µM IPTG at 37°C for 5 h , lysed by sonication , and clarified . Protein was precipitated with 70 % ammonium sulfate , resuspended in buffer D ( 10 mM TrisCl , 1 mM NaN 3 , 1 mM EDTA , 250 mM NaCl , and 2 mM DTT , pH 8 . 0 ) and gel filtered on a 400 - ml column of Sephacryl S - 200 . Peak cofilin fractions were dialyzed against DEAE buffer ( 25 mM TrisCl , pH 8 . 4 , and 2 mM DTT ) loaded on a DEAE - Sepharose column and eluted with a 500 - ml gradient of 0 – 500 mM NaCl in DEAE buffer . Assay for stability Samples of 5 µM cofilins were mixed with 0 – 8 M urea in 10 mM TrisCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) at room temperature for 1 h . Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 310 to 380 nm with excitation at 295 nm with a PTI Alpha - scan fluorimeter ( Photo Technology International ) . The data were analyzed by the linear extrapolation method ( Pace , 1986 ) , which assumes a linear relationship between free energy of unfolding (  G 0 u , water ) and urea concen - tration ( [ urea ] ) . A two - state model relates the observed fluorescence signal ( Y obs ) to the unfolding equilibrium of the native and denatured states ( K U = [ D ] / [ N ] ) : Y K Y K K Y obs = + [ ] + + [ ]     1 1 1 U N U U D × × K G R T m urea R T U O water urea U = −   ∆ × × × , exp [ ] . Y N and Y D are observed fluorescence of the protein at the native and dena - tured state . T is the absolute temperature , and R is the gas constant . Binding of cofilin to actin filaments The experiments were performed in KMEI polymerization buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , and 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 ) with fila - ments polymerized from Mg - ATP - actin monomers . We measured binding of cofilin and cofilin mutants to pyrenyl - actin filaments by quenching of the fluorescence using a PTI Alphascan fluorimeter ( Photo Technology Interna - tional ) with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 410 nm ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) . To measure the time course of binding , the reactants were mixed in a stop - flow apparatus ( Kin - Tek ) . To measure equilibrium binding , the reactants were mixed manually in a 96 - well plate for 30 min before the fluorescence was read with a plate reader ( Spectra Max Gemini XPS ; Molecular Devices ) . Binding of cofilin to actin monomers We measured the affinity of cofilin and cofilin mutants for actin monomers in 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 2 mM TrisCl , and 0 . 5 mM DTT , pH 8 . 0 , by the inhibition of nucleotide exchange ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) . Etheno - ATP - actin was prepared by removing free ATP from Mg - ATP - actin with AX1 - X4 ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) resin in a Spin - X mini col - umn ( Corning ) before incubating the actin with 500 µM etheno - ATP ( Invit - rogen ) for 12 min at 25°C . Excess etheno - ATP was removed by running the solution through AX1 - X4 resin a second time in a Spin - X column . The ex - change reaction was initiated by manually mixing 1 µM Mg - etheno - ATP - actin with 500 µM ATP and a range of concentrations of cofilin . The time course of the dissociation of etheno - ATP from actin was measured by the decrease in fluorescence with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 410 nm . Actin filament – severing assay We observed severing of actin filaments by cofilin or cofilin mutants by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRF ) ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ) . A sample of 2 µM 40 % labeled Oregon green 488 – labeled exhibit a safeguard mechanism ( Liu et al . , 2000 ) . The ability of the hypothetical mechanism to monitor the integrity of the con - tractile ring and delay entry into the next round of mitosis may explain the slow growth and thicker septa of cofilin mutant cells . Role of cofilin in animal cell cytokinesis Cytokinesis in animal cells also depends on cofilins , but the contributions of cofilin have not been investigated in detail . Animal cells deficient in cofilin form clumps of actin filaments rather than complete rings ( Gunsalus et al . , 1995 ; Giansanti et al . , 1999 ; Somma et al . , 2002 ; Ono et al . , 2003 ) and have dif - ficulties completing cleavage ( Kaji et al . , 2003 ; Ono et al . , 2003 ) . These problems may have causes in common with the defects we observed in fission yeast . For example , unstable contractile rings may result in regression of furrows , as observed with ex - posure to cytochalasin ( Carter , 1967 ) and with mutations in many different genes ( Mackay et al . , 1998 ; Powers et al . , 1998 ; Schumacher et al . , 1998 ; Jantsch - Plunger et al . , 2000 ; D’Avino et al . , 2004 ) . Live cell microscopy will be required to appreciate these mechanisms . Materials and methods Strains and culture conditions We subcloned cofilin cDNA into pFA6a - KanMX6 to make pFA6a - ADF1 - KanMX6 . Then we made point mutations of the cofilin cDNA by site - directed mutagenesis ( QuikChange II ; Agilent Technologies ) and used it to replace the ura4 + cassette in the diploid strain adf1 /  adf1 : : ura4 + through PCR - based integration ( Bähler et al . , 1998 ) . Each resulting strain adf1 /  adf1 : : adf1 * - KanMX6 was sporulated on SPA5s plates and dissected into at least 20 tet - rads . The spores  adf1 : : adf1 * - KanMX6 were selected with 100 µg / ml G418 ( Geneticin ; American Bioanalytical ) . Cofilin loci of the positive clones were se - quenced to verify the mutations . Cofilin mutant strains were backcrossed several times with the wild - type strain to confirm that phenotypes were stable . Fluorescence microscopy Yeast cells were cultured by standard methods . To visualize nuclei and cell walls , cells were fixed with cold 70 % ethanol and stained with 1 µg / ml DAPI ( Sigma - Aldrich ) or 40 µg / ml Calcofluor ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and images were taken with a CCD camera ( Orca - ER ; Hamamatsu Photonics ) on a micro - scope ( model IX - 71 ; Olympus ) equipped for epifluorescence . To visualize actin filaments , cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde and permeabilized with 1 % Triton X - 100 before staining with 860 µM Bodipy - phallacidin ( In - vitrogen ) . For imaging live cells , actively growing cultures in YE5s media with OD between 0 . 4 and 0 . 5 were harvested by spinning the cells at 3 , 000 rpm for 1 min and washing briefly three times with EMM5s before resuspending , applying to a 25 % gelatin pad made with EMM5s , and sealing under a coverslip . Live cells were imaged with a 100x Plan Apo - chromat objective lens ( NA 1 . 40 ) on a microscope ( model IX - 71 ; Olympus ) equipped with either a confocal spinning disk unit ( Ultra - view RS ; Perkin - Elmer ) and an Orca - ER camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) or with a CSU X - 1 spinning disk confocal unit ( Yokogawa ) and an Ixon EMCCD camera ( Andor ) . Images were processed using ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda MD ) with free available plug - ins . Unless specified , live cells were all imaged at 25°C . A heated objective lens collar ( Omegalux ) was used for imaging live cells at 36°C . We tracked the positions of the centers of mass of nodes manually in time - lapse movies of live cells at 1 - s intervals with the MtrackJ plug - in for ImageJ ( http : / / www . imagescience . org / meijering / software / mtrackj ) starting from the initial movement until the node merged with another node , a clump of nodes , or a contractile ring . We imaged the nodes in a single confocal section every second , manually tracked their centers of mass during quick bursts of movement , and calcu - lated average velocities along these paths .

Flow cells were preincubated with 1 vol of 200 nM skeletal muscle myosin inactivated with 1 mM N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) for 1 min , washed with 2 vol of HS - TBS ( 50 mM TrisCl , pH 7 . 6 , and 600 mM NaCl ) , 2 vol of 2 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in HS - TBS , and 2 vol of 1x TIRF buffer . Then 15 µl of Mg - ATP actin in TIRF buffer was loaded into the flow cell by capillary action . After the attached actin filaments polymerized for appropriately 5 min , the solution in the flow cell was replaced with 15 µl of cofilin in 1x TIRF buffer . Fluorescence was excited by prism - style TRIF with an argon laser ( Series 43 ; CVI Melles Griot ) . Images were acquired with a microscope ( model IX - 71 ; Olympus ) with a 60x Plan Apochromat ( NA 1 . 4 ) objective lens with an Orca ER camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) . Each data point is the average of three independent experiments . Computer simulations The computer simulations were done with SCPR Controller , written by Dimi - trios Vavylonis ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) with the following parameters : number of nodes = 65 ; number of filaments per node = 2 ; fraction of nodes with formins = 1 ; actin polymerization rate V pol = 74 subunits / s ; capture radius = 0 . 15 µm ; short range repulsion = 0 . 15 µm ; force ( F ) produced by myosin II = 12 pN , based on F = V *  , V is velocity of the nodes ,  is the friction coefficient ; friction = 400 pN * s / µm ; broad band half width = 0 . 8 µm ; cell radius = 1 . 87 µm ( wild - type cells and adf1 - 1 cell ) or 2 . 43 µm ( adf1 - M2 and adf1 - M3 cells ) ; simulation time interval dt = 0 . 5 s ; node connection life - time  break = variable seconds ; lifetime of actin filaments  turnover =  break . Each simulation was run at least five times with the same set of parameters . Online supplemental material Figure S1 shows contractile ring assembly in temperature - sensitive cofilin mutant adf1 - 1 cells and localization of cofilin . Figure S2 shows biochemi - cal characterization of mutant cofilin proteins . Figure S3 shows charac - terization of cofilin mutant adf1 - M2 and adf1 - M3 cells . Figure S4 shows Monte Carlo simulations of the search - capture - pull and release model of contractile ring assembly with variations in cell diameter and  break . Figure S5 shows that actinin is important for cofilin mutant cells to as - semble contractile rings and cofilin contributes to the stability of the rings .
