Verschoor , 7 Bernhard Ehlers 2 , * and ICTV Report Consortium Abstract The Polyomaviridae is a family of small , non - enveloped viruses with circular dsDNA genomes of approximately 5 kbp . The family includes four genera whose members have restricted host range , infecting mammals and birds . Polyomavirus genomes have also been detected recently in fish . Merkel cell polyomavirus and raccoon polyomavirus are associated with cancer in their host ; other members are human and veterinary pathogens . Clinical manifestations are obvious in immunocompromised patients but not in healthy individuals . This is a summary of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ) Report on the taxonomy of the Polyomaviridae , which is available at www . ictv . global / report / polyomaviridae . VIRION Virions are typically 40 – 45 nm in diameter and lack an envelope . The icosahedral capsid is constituted of 72 cap - somers , each composed of five molecules of the major cap - sid protein VP1 ( Table 1 , Fig . 1 ) . Minor capsid proteins are located at the internal face of the capsid [ 1 ] . GENOME The circular , dsDNA genome of approximately 5 kbp is packed with cellular histones and divided into three functional domains : the early region encoding regulatory proteins , the late region encoding capsid proteins , and the non - coding control region , which contains the origin of DNA replication and the promoter / enhancer elements directing transcription of the viral genes ( [ 1 ] , Fig . 2 ) .

Viral decapsidation initiates in the cytosol and is completed in the nucleus , where replication and assembly occur . Viral transcription synthesizes a single precursor mRNA that is alternatively spliced to generate the major early proteins large T - antigen ( LTAg ) and small t - anti - gen ( STAg ) , in addition to minor alternative proteins . LTAg of most polyomaviruses binds repeats of the 5 ¢ - GRGGC - 3 ¢ motifs , while LTAg of gammapolyomaviruses interacts with the palindromic motif 5 ¢ - CC ( W ) 6 GG - 3 ¢ . LTAg possesses ATPase / helicase activity , and autoregulates transcription of the early genes . After replication has initiated , two major late transcripts are produced that are translated as the capsid pro - teins VP1 and VP2 . Alternative start codon usage of the VP2 mRNA can produce VP3 [ 1 ] . Avian polyomaviruses possess a unique VP4 capsid protein [ 2 ] , and some mammalian polyo - maviruses produce an agnoprotein that is involved in tran - scription , virus maturation and egress . Mature virions are released by cell lysis or non - lytically . Polyomavirus infection can be symptomatic and may cause severe disease , including malignancy and organ failure , resulting in death . TAXONOMY Alphapolyomavirus This genus includes > 30 species . Members infect humans and other mammals . Merkel cell polyomavirus and raccoon polyomavirus are so far the only members known to cause cancer in their natural host [ 3 ] . Betapolyomavirus This genus includes > 20 species . Members infect mammals . The well - studied human polyomaviruses BK and JC are associated with nephropathy and progressive multifocal leu - koencephalopathy , respectively [ 3 ] . Gammapolyomavirus This genus includes < 10 species . Members infect birds . Some cause severe illness and even death , but oncogenicity has not been observed [ 3 ] . Deltapolyomavirus This genus includes the species Human polyomavirus 6 and Human polyomavirus 7 , members of which exhibit skin tro - pism , and Human polyomavirus 10 and Human polyomavirus 11 , members of which ( MW polyomavirus and STL polyoma - virus , respectively ) , are commonly detected in the gastrointes - tinal tract [ 3 ] . The general mode of polyomavirus diversification is co - specia - tion with their hosts . Recombination has shaped polyomavirus genomes and resulted in conflicting phylogenetic signals from the early and late genomic regions [ 4 ] . A distant evolutionary relationship of polyomaviruses to ssDNA viruses has been suggested on the basis of structural similarity in replicative proteins [ 5 ] .
