Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates actin filaments in vitro and of dynamic actin assembly at the leading edge of migrating cells . We previously showed that cortactin generates branched filaments with a characteristic 70 8 angle between branches [ 7 , 8 ] . The branched filaments binds to Arp2 / 3 complex , the essential molecular machine for nucleating actin filament assembly .

Actin polymerization was initiated by the addition of monomeric actin ( 7 . 5 % pyrene - labeled ) and monitored by the continuous measurement of fluorescence at 386 nm [ 22 ] . 100 nM Arp2 / 3 was tested with increasing concentrations of cortactin .

In four independent experiments , an equivalent level of synergy between cortactin and VCA was consistently observed ( see Supplementary material available with this article on that occurs in vivo . We asked whether cortactin stabilizes the internet for a table of all results ) . branched networks by inhibiting debranching .

Actin filament networks created by Arp2 / 3 complex de - branch over time in vitro [ 8 , 10 ] and model the disassembly At 8 min , the actin network was fully polymerized and Brief Communication 373 Figure 5 Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments . This mechanism of action is consistent with the requirement for both the F - actin and Arp2 / 3 binding domains of cortactin in the acti - vation of Arp2 / 3 complex and may also explain the synergy of cortactin with VCA . Cortactin localizes to sites of dynamic actin assembly in vivo , including the actin tail of rocketing endosomes [ 2 , 3 ] . Of note , N - WASp is present only at the rim of the endosome [ 2 , 21 ] , whereas Arp2 / 3 complex and cortactin are also present throughout the F - actin tail [ 2 , 3 ] . These results are consistent with our proposed mechanism in which cortactin binds to F - actin and Arp2 / 3 complex to stabilize sites of actin filament branching . The finding that cortactin inhibits debranching of Arp2 / 3 - induced filament networks represents a novel mecha - nism for promoting actin assembly . In contrast to WASp Cortactin inhibits debranching of VCA / Arp2 / 3 - nucleated actin family members , cortactin stabilizes branched filaments filaments . G - actin ( 3 m M ) was polymerized in the presence of Arp2 / 3 ( 100 nM ) 1 GST - VCA ( 600 nM ) for 8 min . At that time , rhodamine - once they are formed . The mechanism for this stabiliza - phalloidin ( 0 min sample ) , 500 nM cortactin ( 1 Cortactin ) , or buffer tion of branch points may involve the ability of cortactin ( 1 Buffer ) was added to individual parallel reactions . The cortactin and to bind F - actin and Arp2 / 3 complex simultaneously , per - buffer samples were incubated for 5 , 10 , or 20 additional min before haps by increasing the affinity of Arp2 / 3 complex for either the debranching reactions were stopped with equimolar rhodamine - phalloidin and visualized . Error bars represent SEM ( n 5 3 ) . the mother filament or the daughter branch . The latter could involve increasing the affinity of Arp2 / 3 complex for the pointed end of actin filaments , which has been proposed to be important in regulating branch stability had begun to debranch . Cortactin ( 500 nM ) or buffer [ 10 ] . Whereas cortactin inhibits debranching , ADF / cofilin was added , and we removed samples and added them to accelerates debranching and promotes filament disassem - rhodamine - phalloidin to arrest debranching and visualize bly [ 10 , 11 ] . Thus , the relative activities of cortactin and the filament network . This experiment was designed to ADF / cofilin may be important determinants of the extent measure debranching . One cannot rule out the possibility and speed of dynamic actin assembly in cells . that some new filaments were formed during the course of the reaction ; however , only minimal G - actin was avail - In conclusion , we have discovered that cortactin promotes able for de novo filament formation , because the majority branched actin filament network formation by Arp2 / 3 of the actin was in the polymerized form .
