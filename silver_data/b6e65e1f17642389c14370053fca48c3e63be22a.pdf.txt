However , such analysis is often limited to human - deÔ¨Åned and static features . Here , we introduce a novel framework that can characterize shape changes ( morphodynamics ) for cell - drug inter - actions directly from images , and use it to interpret perturbed development of Phakopsora pachyrhizi , the Asian soybean rust crop pathogen . We describe population development over a 2D space of shapes ( mor - phospace ) using two models with condition - dependent parameters : a top - down Fokker - Planck model of diÔ¨Äusive development over Waddington - type landscapes , and a bottom - up model of tip growth . We dis - cover a variety of landscapes , describing phenotype transitions during growth , and identify possible per - turbations in the tip growth machinery that cause this variation . This demonstrates a widely - applicable integration of unsupervised learning and biophysical modeling . Introduction QuantiÔ¨Åcations of cell shape changes ( morphodynamics ) can reveal key developmental transitions and be - havioural strategies , as well as modes of action of drugs by comparison with known drug - phenotype mappings [ 1 , 2 ] . While recent progress in automated image analysis has popularized static descriptors beyond mean growth rates and metabolic Ô¨Çuxes [ 3 ] , the incorporation of dynamics can provide more complete system descriptions [ 4 ] , and may also aid the development and validation of mechanistic models [ 5 ] . Here , we de - veloped such a framework and used it to interpret how fungicides aÔ¨Äect the morphodynamics of Phakopsora pachyhizi , the pathogen that causes rust disease in the soybean crop worldwide . Spores land on soybean leaves , grow germ tubes , penetrate the plant using appressoria , and subsequently form haustoria that extract nutrients [ 6 ] , as sketched in Fig . 1a . This little - understood pathogen can cause economically devastating yield losses of up to 80 % [ 7 ] and is fast resistance - evolving [ 8 ] . Current methods for quantifying organism morphodynamics typically rely on a low - dimensional space of interpretable features [ 9 ] . Though existing methods have uncovered remarkable behavioural patterns , revealing chemotactic strategies , temporal processing and social cooperation in a range of organisms [ 10 ‚Äì 13 ] , typical shortcomings are as follows : Ô¨Årst , they are often based on particular shape descriptors ( e . g . 1D centerlines ) , restricting analysis to a narrow range of morphologies , often requiring sophisticated feature extraction algorithms . Second , they focus on stereotyped behaviours , which may not be characteristic of early development . Finally , states are often discretized and transition probabilities extracted , which obscures the continuous nature of morphodynamics . Alternatively , statistical analysis can be based on thousands of behavioral features to cluster and classify compounds and compare the results with known modes of action , but results can be diÔ¨Écult to interpret [ 2 ] . In contrast to statistical correlates , interpretable continuous and stochastic models can be considered , but are not yet associated with morphodynamics . For instance , in Waddington‚Äôs epigenetic landscape , cells begin at the top as pluripotent , and subsequently develop into a number of diÔ¨Äerentiated states , represented as lower - level valleys [ 14 ] . Despite many applications [ 15 ‚Äì 19 ] , to our knowledge such landscapes have only been uncovered at steady - state . A major method for image analysis , dimensionality reduction , and inference is deep learning [ 20 ] . Feed - forward deep neural networks are comprized of a series of interconnected layers of artiÔ¨Åcial neurons , which transform inputs through a series of non - linear operations [ 21 ] . Network parameters are updated through stochastic gradient descent and its variants in order to minimize a human - deÔ¨Åned objective ( the loss ) . These networks have been proven capable of approximating any function , given a suÔ¨Écient number of parameters [ 22 ] . To link data analysis and modeling , two types of network are particularly important : Ô¨Årst , autoencoders , which are capable of capturing low dimensional structure in data through a constrained reconstruction task [ 23 ] . Due to their high Ô¨Çexibility , autoencoders have many advantages over non - parametric t - distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ( t - SNE ) and linear principal component analysis ( PCA ) algorithms . Sec - ond , physics - informed neural networks ( PINNs ) . While forward problems can be solved fast with grid - based methods , PINNs can solve inverse ( inference ) problems for a wide range of diÔ¨Äerential equations [ 24 , 25 ] . Here , we aimed to extract morphodynamic characterizations for intuitive comparison across compounds . SpeciÔ¨Åcally , we analyzed P . pachyrhizi , germinating in vitro in a control compound and several fungicides , by Ô¨Årst using an autoencoder to uncover a single 2D morphospace of salient features from high - throughput images of Ô¨Åxated fungi ( Fig . 1a - b ) . We then Ô¨Åtted two minimal models of dynamics over this morphospace 1 Approximate Bayesian Computation p Physics - informed neural network Condition - dependent Fokker Planck PDE residual Landscapes Parameter posteriors Simulation embeddings Autoencoder Data embeddings Image snapshots at 9 time points Morphospace a U Top - down landscape interpretation Bottom - up biophysical model ùëà ( ùê± ) b d c Figure 1 : Morphodynamics of the Asian soybean rust pathogen , P . pachyrhizi , are charac - terized through condition - dependent dynamics over a global morphospace . ( a ) P . pachyrhizi burrows into soybean leaves to extract nutrients , as sketched ( top ) . Image sets at 9 time points under 6 conditions ( bottom ) are processed to yield aligned , single - fungus images . ( b ) An autoencoder learns the bio - physical degrees of freedom from the images , discovering a 2D morphospace . ( c ) Dynamics are characterized using two models : a top - down landscape ( U ( x ) ) model , where a physics - informed neural network Ô¨Åts the Fokker - Planck equation to the morphospace embeddings , and a bottom - up persistent random walk model of the growth zone , with parameters Ô¨Åtted using approximate Bayesian computation with a morphospace - derived similarity metric . These yield ( d ) interpretable , condition - dependent characterizations in the form of Waddington - type landscapes and tip growth parameter posteriors . and took their condition - dependent parameters as informative characterizations ( Fig . 1c - d ) . The two models approach the dynamics from opposite directions : the Ô¨Årst is a top - down model that utilizes a Fokker - Planck description to uncover the global morphodynamic driving forces in the form of Waddington - type landscapes , and the second is a bottom - up persistent random walk model of the growth zone at the tip . We used a PINN to infer the landscapes , and approximate Bayesian computation , in conjunction with a morphospace - derived similarity metric , to infer the parameter posteriors of the tip growth model . The uncovered landscapes show that morphodynamics are diÔ¨Äusion - dominated until the germ tube begins to bend , at which point deterministic forces begin to drive trajectories apart . Fungicide - induced deformations include barriers , plateaus and canalized pathways , which may arise from diÔ¨Äering stabilities of the growth zone . To avoid ‚Äòblack - box‚Äô methods , we analyzed our PINN to interpret the convergence . Our work shows how intuitive system characterizations can be acquired directly from images , by integrating unsupervised learning and biophysical modeling . Results A Global Morphospace Reveals Perturbed Morphodynamics Manual categorization of phenotypes is time consuming and limited to discrete human - deÔ¨Åned features ( Fig . 2a ) . In contrast , manifold - based dimensionality reduction can provide a continuous low - dimensional space where dynamics are as simple as possible [ 26 ] . This is because an imaged dynamic system with n degrees of freedom traces out an n - dimensional manifold within the higher dimensional pixel space , irrespective of the image dimensionality . To learn such a morphospace for P . pachyrhizi growth , we carried out a high - throughput imaging assay of distinct populations at 9 equally - spaced time points , between 90 and 210 minutes after mixing with diÔ¨Äerent compounds ( code names used henceforth given in brackets ) : a dimethylsulphoxide control ( DMSO ) , methyl benzimidazol - 2 - ylcarbamate at 1 . 1 mgL - 1 ( carbendazim , Compound A ) , PIK - 75 hydrochloride at 3 . 3 mgL - 1 ( Compound B ) , benzovindiÔ¨Çupyr ( Compound C ) at 0 . 041 mgL - 1 and 10 mgL - 1 , and Compound X ( a Syngenta research compound related to triÔ¨Çuoromethyloxadiazoles [ 27 ] , see Supplementary Fig . 7 for the chemical structure ) at 1 . 1 mgL - 1 . These compounds were identiÔ¨Åed at pre - screening to show a range of phenotypes . We henceforth refer to each combination of compound and concentration as a condition .

( a ) Human categorization of P . pachyrhizi phenotypes is time consuming and introduces human biases and unnatural discretization . ( b ) A convolutional autoencoder addresses these shortcomings by learning the manifold associated with each condition , sketched inset . Morphospace features are shown by propagating morphospace coordinates on a grid through the decoder . ( c ) 210 min embeddings for all conditions show that fungicides can induce per - turbed dynamics over the morphospace , which therefore represents for an expressive space for diÔ¨Äerentiating morphodynamics upon . extracted single - fungus images from the snapshot data sets , aligned such that the initial growth directions coincided , using automated processing , which yielded approximately 600 , 000 images in total ( with mean and standard deviation across snapshots of approximately 11 , 000 and 3 , 000 respectively ) . In order to validate the inferred Fokker - Planck model parameters and to motivate the tip growth model , we also gathered a small number of time - lapse videos of individual fungi for each compound ( 3 - 8 , see Supplementary Movies 1 - 5 ) , and aligned these manually . High - throughput analysis is not carried out with time - lapse videos in industry due to technical limitations . See Methods and Supplementary Note 1 for details on the compounds , imaging and 3 image processing , and Supplementary Fig . 4a for an example time - lapse sequence . The morphodynamics are perturbed diÔ¨Äerently in diÔ¨Äerent conditions , and so the manifold traced out by a P . pachyrhizi population is condition - dependent ( as sketched in the inset of Fig . 2b ) . To pull the condition - dependent manifolds together into a global morphospace , we trained a convolutional autoencoder ( CAE ) [ 28 ] , an architecture specialized for images , with a 2D code space on images from all conditions and times ( see Supplementary Note 1 for details on the architecture and training ) . To ensure the CAE used the morphodynamic manifolds to solve this reconstruction task , we selected the network complexity and training time that provided the simplest trajectories for embeddings associated with a small number of single - fungus videos . Figure 2b shows the distribution of features over the morphospace , found by propagating morphospace coordinates on a grid through the decoder . Distance from the spore embedding loosely captures lengthening , and angle captures variation in Ô¨Ånal shape . Figure 2c shows the 210 min embeddings for all conditions , revealing how fungicides can perturb dynamics over the morphospace . Some introduce novel features , e . g . the branching by Compound B , whereas others change the distribution over wild - type features , e . g . the increased prevalance of straightening induced by Compound X . In order to move from coarse - grained qual - itative insights to quantitative characterizations , we next Ô¨Åtted two simple models of dynamics over the morphospace . Emergent Landscapes Show the Morphodynamic Driving Forces Condition - dependent Waddington - type landscapes are intuitive morphodynamic characterizations that can be inferred from the snapshot embeddings evolving over the morphospace . We model each condition as inducing a time - independent Ô¨Åeld of driving forces , F ( x ; c , Œª ) , that depends on the compound concentration , c , and any pharmacophores , captured in a parameter vector , Œª . In the absence of any curl , as we assume for early development , the force Ô¨Åeld can be associated with the gradient of a quasi - potential , U , via F = ‚àí‚àá U , which we take as the developmental landscape . For cases where the underlying force Ô¨Åeld does have curl , landscapes can still be uncovered by splitting the force into curl - free and curl - containing components , yielding a ‚Äòpotential and Ô¨Çux‚Äô description [ 15 ] . To enable the inference of landscapes , we connected the evolving snapshot embeddings to the driving forces through a Fokker - Planck model . These embeddings were transformed into probability density func - tions ( PDFs ) on a grid using kernel density estimation ( KDE , Fig . 3a ) [ 29 ] . The Fokker - Planck partial diÔ¨Äerential equation ( PDE ) is used to separate out a system‚Äôs driving forces and stochastic processes , and model statistical ensembles of Brownian particles . Each particle moves over the landscape according to the following stochastic diÔ¨Äerential equation : dx = ‚àí‚àá U ( x ) dt + œÉ ( x , t ) dW , ( 1 ) where x and t are the position in 2D space and time , œÉ ( x , t ) is a noise matrix and dW is the Wiener process . œÉ ( x , t ) has diagonal entries p 2 D ( x , t ) and zeros elsewhere , with D being the diÔ¨Äusivity . The Fokker - Planck equation for the evolution of the PDF of the particle positions , p ( x , t ) , is then ‚àÇp ( x , t ) ‚àÇt = 2 X i = 1 ‚àÇ ‚àÇx i (cid:20) ‚àÇU ( x ) ‚àÇx i p ( x , t ) + ‚àÇ ‚àÇx i [ D ( x , t ) p ( x , t ) ] (cid:21) . ( 2 ) To learn the Fokker - Planck landscapes ( and diÔ¨Äusivities ) given the PDF data , i . e . solve the inverse problem , we used a physics - informed neural network ( PINN ) [ 24 ] . These learn PDE solutions by optimally matching PDF data , minimising the magnitude of the PDE residual , and satisfying any further constraints , e . g . boundary conditions . PINNs have several favorable properties over alternative methods for solving the inverse problem [ 25 ] . First , in going from the forward to the inverse problem , the only change required is the addition of extra learnable parameters ; second , they can infer the governing equation with only sparse data , since they solve the inference of the full PDF and governing equation as a joint task [ 30 ] ; third , they learn a continuous fully - diÔ¨Äerentiable solution , which means other variables of interest can be calculated directly from the learned variables , without numerical approximation ( useful when transitioning between potential and force , for example ) ; fourth , they learn progressively more complex functions as training progresses . As we show , this is a useful property when combined with early stopping if the required function complexity is 4 90 min 210 min ln ùêÖ m . u . min - 1 ùë• ! ùëù ( ùê± , ùë° ) ùë° ùë• " & ùëù ( ùê± , ùë° ) residual , ùëà ( ùê± ) ùêø # $ % ùêø # $ & , ùêø ‚Äô ( , ùêø ) * + , Fokker Planck PDE residual ùí© & ùëù , , ùëà , , ùê∑ ùêø - * - . / , ùê∑ ( ùê± , ùë° ) ùë• ! ùë• " ùë° ùë• ! ùë• " ùë° ùë• ! ùë• " < ‚àí5 a b c d > ‚àí2 6 , 000 Mini - batch 500 12 , 000 17 , 000 Waddington‚Äôs landscape Steep Shallow DMSO Compound A Compound B Compound X Figure 3 : Morphodynamic landscapes learned by the PINN . ( a ) Morphospace embeddings are trans - formed into probability density functions ( PDFs ) , p ( x , t ) , using kernel density estimation ( KDE ) , yielding nine snapshots per condition . ( b ) A physics - informed neural network ( PINN ) learns the landscapes by Ô¨Åtting the Fokker - Planck equation to the PDFs . For each condition , the architecture comprizes a neural network to learn each of the PDF , ÀÜ p ( x , t ) , diÔ¨Äusivity , ÀÜ D ( x , t ) , and landscape , ÀÜ U ( x ) . The outputs of these are put through a series of diÔ¨Äerential operators that outputs the Fokker - Planck residual , N , and the architecture is trained to match the data ( L PDF ) , minimize the magnitude of the residual ( L PDE ) , satisfy the boundary conditions ( L BC ) and learn a normalized PDF ( L norm ) . ( c ) The architecture is trained over a series of mini - batches , with lower frequency solutions explored Ô¨Årst . ( d ) Landscapes with simulated particles , from 90 mins ( pink ) to 210 mins ( blue ) after mixing with compounds , are shown , colored by the gradient magnitude , k F k ( in terms of morphospace units , m . u . ) . These are analogous to Waddington‚Äôs epigenetic landscape , as sketched in the inset . The black outlines show the contour where the PDF learned by the PINN is 10 ‚àí 3 for DMSO and each condition . The inner region therefore highlights areas with high data density , with the remaining areas shown to facilitate connection with the morphospace and outer tendencies . Contour lines are plotted along equal landscape values , with spacings of 0 . 11 , 0 . 08 , 0 . 07 and 0 . 09 m . u . 2 min - 1 for the landscapes from left to right . Morphodynamics are diÔ¨Äusion - dominated until the germ tube begins to bend , at which point deterministic forces begin to drive trajectories apart . Fungicide - induced deformations including barriers , plateaus and canalized pathways . This susceptibility to deformation , combined with the generality of the model , make the Fokker - Planck model well - suited for system characterization . not known a priori . Finally , they scale more favorably with system dimensionality than grid - based methods , which can often perform well only for low - dimensional problems . This Ô¨Ånal property will prove especially useful when extending this work to higher - dimensional morphospaces . We used one network to learn each of the PDF , diÔ¨Äusivity and potential ( Fig . 3b ) . The outputs of these ( ÀÜ p ( x , t ) , ÀÜ D ( x , t ) and ÀÜ U ( x ) respectively ) are put through a series of diÔ¨Äerential operators ( N ) that outputs the Fokker - Planck residual , N ( ÀÜ p , ÀÜ U , ÀÜ D ) = ‚àí ‚àÇ ÀÜ p ‚àÇt + 2 X i = 1 ‚àÇ ‚àÇx i " ‚àÇ ÀÜ U ‚àÇx i ÀÜ p + ‚àÇ ‚àÇx i ( ÀÜ D ÀÜ p ) # , ( 3 ) which is incorporated into the loss so that the solution obeys the PDE . The total loss to be minimized ( L total ) is the sum of four terms ( shown in full in Methods ) . The Ô¨Årst three are calculated over randomized mini - batches . They are the mean squared error between the data and learned PDF ( L PDF ) , the mean squared PDF at the boundary ( L BC ) , and the mean squared PDE residual ( L PDE ) . The Ô¨Ånal term ensures the PDF is normalized , and is the squared diÔ¨Äerence between unity and a numerical integration over the full grid at a randomly - selected time point ( L norm ) . The relative importance 5 of these terms is determined by hyperparameters a , b , c and d , L total = aL PDF + bL BC + cL PDE + dL norm , ( 4 ) and lower frequency functions are explored Ô¨Årst ( Fig . 3c , [ 31 ] ) , in alignment with Occam‚Äôs razor . An ablation analysis also conÔ¨Årms that both space and time - dependent diÔ¨Äusion are required for the best model Ô¨Åt ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Letting the PINN train to convergence would result in overÔ¨Åtting . This is the phenomenon where a neural network‚Äôs function pushes beyond the problem - dependent desired complexity ; for example , in image classiÔ¨Åcation the network begins to learn spurious patterns and to generalize poorly to new data . In the context of inference from independent snapshots , overÔ¨Åtting corresponds to Ô¨Åtting to diÔ¨Äerences between individual snapshots that arise from variability between P . pachyrhizi batches . While having independent snapshots is beneÔ¨Åcial in that it shows a wider range of dynamics , this can result in features like a non monotonically - decreasing fraction of spores , which should not be captured in the model . The PINN learns trends common to all snapshots Ô¨Årst , and we stop training before overÔ¨Åtting begins , identiÔ¨Åed by monitoring the spore region ( as shown in Supplementary Fig . 1b - c for three training repeats ) . This regularization technique is known as early stopping . We note that the loss exponentially decays after an initial period of fast improvement . Hence , reasonable results can be achieved using much earlier stopping points than used here , if computational time is limited . Further details on the PINN architecture , hyperparameters and optimization can be found in Methods and Supplementary Note 2 . Figure 3d shows the landscapes learned by the PINN , as well as a sample of forward simulations of Eq . 1 ( see Methods for details on the forward simulations ) , and the correspondence between the landscapes and morphospace is shown in Supplementary Fig . 2 . The overÔ¨Åtting point described above approximately corre - sponds to 30 , 30 , 30 , 20 , 25 and 25 hours of training for DMSO and Compounds A , B , C ( 0 . 041 mgL - 1 ) , C ( 10 mgL - 1 ) and X , respectively . DiÔ¨Äusion over the landscapes has two sources : morphodynamic diÔ¨Äusion , i . e . the fundamental unpredictability of morphology change from one time step to the next on the 2D morphological data manifold ; and embedding noise , which arises because variations in image resolution , segmentation and alignment induce perturbations away from the manifold , and the complexity of the autoencoder‚Äôs embedding function means these perturbations are not always just mapped to the closest point on the 2D manifold . Since the same image pre - processing algorithms were used on all conditions , diÔ¨Äerences in the Fokker - Planck diÔ¨Äusion over the same region of morphospace will be morphodynamic in nature , rather than arising from the embedding noise . The condition - dependent landscapes are highly interpretable ( Fig . 3d ) . DMSO development begins in a metastable region of spores where diÔ¨Äusion dominates , with a threshold energy required for germination , and annealing diÔ¨Äusivity capturing a subpopulation of spores that never cross this threshold ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . This may be similar to germination mechanics in Ô¨Åssion yeast , where a polar cap stochastically wanders as the spore grows and ultimately breaks out once a critical strain is passed [ 32 ] . Morphodynamics are diÔ¨Äusion - dominated until the germ tube begins to bend , at which point deterministic forces begin to drive trajectories apart . Compound A introduces a plateau in the region where tip bending begins , revealing growth stunting , and also opens up new features with numerous bends . Extreme cases of heteregeneous growth , for example the diÔ¨Äerence between fungi with dramatically slowed growth and others with completely unhindered growth , are captured by the Fokker - Planck model through plateaus followed by abnormally high gradients , shown dark red . Compound B opens up a new branching feature region immediately following germination . Some fungi do develop normally , but without signiÔ¨Åcant bending , and with reduced growth rates . Compound X canalizes trajectories through only a subset of the features expressed in DMSO , namely straightening , with fungi closely following the landscape , before stunting occurs at a common location for most . Supplementary Fig . 1 - 2 show that Compound C at 0 . 041 mgL - 1 inhibits growth slightly , primarily through reduced diÔ¨Äusion rather than reduced landscape gradients , and increasing the concentration to 10 mgL - 1 drastically increases the stability of the spore region . The data PDFs compare well with PDFs generated by a kernel density estimate ( KDE ) of simulated tra - jectories for all conditions , validating the solution accuracy ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Images from the videos can also be embedded in the morphospace , and the mean squared displacements of the video trajectories with those of the simulations show good agreement ( Supplementary Fig . 4b - c ) . Furthermore , the entropy of the simulations always increases ( Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . To get a measure of the uncertainty in the inferred landscapes and diÔ¨Äusivities , we trained the PINN three times for each compound , which exposed 6 the algorithm to diÔ¨Äerent data mini - batches . For each condition , the total losses decreased at similar rates ( meaning the solutions are equally good at each training time ) , with overÔ¨Åtting occurring at approximately the same point . We therefore quantiÔ¨Åed uncertainty through the standard deviation of the Ô¨Åelds across repeats at the early stopping times described above ( Supplementary Fig . 1b - f ) . The landscapes therefore provide intuitive comparisons of morphodynamics across conditions .

( a ) Tip growth is described with variables for length , L , linearly increasing in time , and path curvature , Œ∫ , which undergoes a persistent random walk , with relaxation to straight growth ( i . e . a central growth zone ) . Dynamics of Œ∫ may be the result of a diÔ¨Äusing growth zone , shown with angular location Œ∏ tip , which causes a changing direction of growth , described by Œ∏ global in the lab frame . ( b ) All parameters were Ô¨Åtted using approximate Bayesian computation with sequential Monte Carlo ( ABC - SMC ) . Lengthening parameters were Ô¨Åtted using length ( L ) histograms at 9 equally - spaced time points ( 3 of the 9 DMSO snapshots are shown here , with data in grey and simulations in black ) , between 90 and 210 min after mixing with solution . ( c ) Bending parameters were Ô¨Åtted by comparing morphospace embeddings of the 210 min snapshot data with those of images simulated with MAP lengthening parameters , as shown here for DMSO . ( d ) MAP germination time cumulative density functions ( CDFs ) and growth rate probability density functions ( PDFs ) show typical perturbations include premature germination , reduced germination frequency , and reduced maximum and mean growth rates . ( e ) Bending parameter posteriors ( for stochasticity , œÉ , and relaxation to straight growth , œÑ ‚àí 1 ) show Ô¨Ånal morphologies depend primarily on the ratio of the two bending parameters , and fungicides can both increase and decrease this ratio . Accepted parameters of the Ô¨Ånal ABC - SMC population are plotted in white , with MAP values in red . Source data are provided for ( d - e ) . The morphospace can also be used for data - driven development of a minimal mechanistic model to reveal potential causes of the landscape deformations discovered above . Having a single model with condition - dependent parameters provides further cell - mechanical characterization . We developed such a model for tip growth under all but Compound B and Compound C at 10 mgL - 1 ( we excluded these because Compound B induces branching , which cannot be captured under the proposed model , and Compound C at 10 mgL - 1 does not permit a signiÔ¨Åcant germ tube to develop ) . The morphospace reveals Ô¨Ånal shape and associated lengthening to be the primary degrees of freedom across the populations , motivating equations for length , 7 L , and tip bending . From the videos , we observed three core features of lengthening ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) : that germination time is variable , that length increases approximately linearly with time , and that this growth rate is variable . We therefore modeled germination time , t g , and subsequent linear growth rate , Œ± , as lognormally - distributed , with growth rate distributed according to a reversed lognormal distribution truncated at zero . The lognormal distribution is widely used to model skewed phenomena across biology , including heterogeneous sensitivity to fungicides [ 33 ] . We compared three models for tip bending : a simple random walk in growth direction , Œ∏ global ( Fig . 4a ) ; a random walk in the curvature of the growth path , Œ∫ ; and a persistent random walk in Œ∫ with parameters for stochasticity , œÉ , and relaxation to straight growth , œÑ ‚àí 1 ( see Methods for the mathematical expression of each model ) . Dynamics in Œ∫ are a simple way to capture the eÔ¨Äects of a diÔ¨Äusing growth zone , as has been described in Ô¨Åssion yeast , where it is directed by landmark proteins concentrated at microtubule end points [ 34 ] . This connection can be made slightly more explicit by the introduction of an angular growth zone position , Œ∏ tip , and a mapping Œ∫ = f ( Œ∏ tip ) . While f is unknown , this function is likely monotonically increasing , and passing through the origin ( i . e . a central growth zone corresponds to straight growth ) . Supplementary Fig . 5b shows Œ∏ global variation in time for the three models , for some intuition on the dynamics . For both parameter inference and model selection , we used approximate Bayesian computation with se - quential Monte Carlo ( ABC - SMC , details on the SMC are in Methods ) [ 35 ] . In ABC , parameters are selected from a prior distribution and simulations are run . If the simulations are within some threshold of similarity with the data , then the parameters are stored . The density over the stored parameters forms the posterior distribution . For model selection , model index is introduced as an additional parameter and the posterior distribution is found over the joint space of model index and parameters , with the marginal distribution over model index giving the model probabilities . This biases towards low - dimensional parameter spaces , favoring the most parsimonious models . For the parameters involved in lengthening , we used histograms of fungus lengths at each snapshot ( see Fig . 4b for three of the nine DMSO snapshots ) . For the bending parameters , we then simulated fungus images using maximum a posteriori probability ( MAP ) lengthening parameters , and compared histograms of their morphospace embeddings with those of the 210 min snapshot data ( Fig . 4c for DMSO ) . Further details can be found in Methods . Compound A data was used for model selection , as it covered the full spectrum of features . Only Model 3 could reproduce the data with high accuracy ( in particular the multiple bends , where relaxation to central growth is required to reproduce the alternating bending direction ) . This match is shown by the probabilities of the three models and MAP simulations ( Supplementary Fig . 5c - d ) . The equations governing dynamics after germination are therefore for t > t g ( dL = Œ±dt dŒ∫ = ‚àí œÑ ‚àí 1 Œ∫dt + œÉdW , ( 5 ) where dW is the Wiener process , and for t ‚â§ t g we have L = Œ∫ = 0 . Figure 4d shows the cumulative density functions ( CDFs ) of germination time and PDFs of growth rate associated with MAP parameters for each condition . Germination time is strongly skewed , with fungicides inducing premature germination and reducing subsequent germination frequency . Growth rates are less skewed , and both the maximum and mean growth rates are reduced by all fungicides . The bending posterior distributions ( Fig . 4e ) have linear shape , showing that for all conditions , the morphology depends primarily on the ratio of œÑ ‚àí 1 to œÉ . Compounds A and X induce decreased and increased ratios of relaxation to stochasticity , respectively . Comparisons of MAP simulations with data for all conditions are shown in full in Supplementary Fig . 6 . Discussion Phenotypic screens are often used to identify drug eÔ¨Écacy and mode of action by comparing visible fea - tures like morphology . However , such screens are often limited to human - deÔ¨Åned and static features , and any incorporation of dynamics typically focuses on stereotyped behaviors . Here , we characterized morpho - dynamics of the Asian soybean rust crop pathogen , P . pachyrhizi , germinating in vitro in the presence of diÔ¨Äerent fungicides , directly from image sets . We found that morphodynamics are diÔ¨Äusion - dominated until the tip begins to bend , at which point deterministic forces begin to drive trajectories apart . Fungicide - induced landscape deformations include barriers , plateaus and canalized pathways . These features may arise 8 from physical perturbations including premature but lower - frequency germination , reduced growth rates , and both increased and reduced stabilities of the growth zone . The global morphospace therefore allowed us to extract meaningful morphodynamic parameters directly from images , revealing perturbed driving forces in the Fokker - Planck model , and providing a similarity metric for the tip growth model . For both models , the non - linear embedding aÔ¨Äords crucial interpretability through visualization . Moreover , the two models give complementary views of the dynamics . Taking Compound X as an example , the landscape model reveals low diÔ¨Äusion following germination when compared with DMSO . Hence , once germinated with Compound X , fungi grow at very similar rates , with little bending , tightly following the underlying landscape . The tip growth model similarly shows a narrowed distribution of growth rates and reduced bending , and these observations are conÔ¨Årmed when reviewing the time - lapse videos after the analysis . Despite many beneÔ¨Åts , the analysis in its current form has limitations . For systems with higher - dimensional dynamics , a 2D morphospace may be unsuitable . For instance , we omitted a compound that induced blistering along the germ tube , which expanded the compound‚Äôs morphospace beyond two dimen - sions . For such cases , the bottom - up mechanistic model parameter Ô¨Åtting can be done in higher dimensions , but at the cost of increased computation time and reduced interpretability . For the Fokker - Planck model , higher - dimensional systems may still be characterized in terms of networks of attractors [ 18 ] , and the marginal dynamics of pairs of morphological degrees of freedom could still be visualized in 2D . Such characterizing of dynamics over non - linear representations may be most powerful when diÔ¨Äerent conditions cover similar features , such that diÔ¨Äerences have a physical , rather than algorithmic , origin . As well as being able to char - acterize dynamics across multiple conditions , these simple models are useful for systems without a priori established dynamics . Do the landscapes correspond to any physical quantities beyond representing a distilled statistical rep - resentation ? The potentials represent the deterministic part of the motion , e . g . extension of the germ tube from turgor pressure and vesicle delivery ( the potentials largely drive in the direction of increasing length ) . Furthermore , diÔ¨Äusion captures features that vary at single - fungus level , including the precise growth rate , and the direction of bending ( potentially caused by a diÔ¨Äusing growth zone or noise [ 34 ] ) . The observed phenotypes are certainly plausible based on putative modes of action of the drugs in terms of inhibiting microtubules , kinases , and gene expression ( see Supplementary Note 4 ) . An interesting area for future work is to extend unsupervised morphodynamic analysis beyond minimal characterizations , to more detailed models . This could be achieved by joint learning of the underlying rep - resentation and equations of motion e . g . by minimizing the prediction error and complexity of the equations of motion . Such approaches have been shown capable of recovering physical laws in Cartesian coordinates from warped video footage [ 36 ] , and it would be interesting to extend this to complex biological systems , where the underlying laws are less clear . Modeling of cell growth in terms of generalized shape coordinates is an area of active research , with one promising model balancing dissipative , mechanical and active forces [ 37 ] . Another interesting area for future work is to better understand the connection between internal me - chanics and morphodynamics . This could be achieved by joint modeling morphology and organelles ( using Ô¨Çourescent markers ) , conditional on various pharmacophores . Interesting organelles and molecular processes may include secretory vesicles for membrane delivery , small GTPases for growth cone labelling , and motor and cytoskeletal proteins for transport and structure [ 38 ] . Interpretable representations for each could be found using non - linear dimensionality reduction , as done here for morphology [ 39 ] . Although often hailed as the future of deep learning , use of unsupervised learning techniques within the natural sciences often stops at low - dimensional data visualizations . We hope the work presented here may stimulate further work leveraging the discovery power of unsupervised methods within interpretable physical models . Methods Algorithms were run in Python , and packages used are detailed in Supplementary Methods . Imaging and Image Processing For the snapshot data , spores were mixed in each of the 6 treatment solutions and imaged in 96 - well plates on the Opera QEHS running Opera Software 2 . 0 ( EvoShell , Opera CHKN / QEHS Red Ver . 2 . 0 . 0 . 12017 Rev . : 9 89046 , PerkinElmer Inc . ) . At 9 equally - spaced times between 90 and 210 min , cell walls were stained with CalcoÔ¨Çuor White solution with KOH , which Ô¨Åxated the fungi . Each snapshot was therefore of a diÔ¨Äerent batch of spores . The staining procedure enabled the collection of two images for each well and time point , using diÔ¨Äerent excitation wavelengths , one showing the spores and another showing the germ tubes . For the time - lapse videos , images were taken at 3 min intervals on the JuLI Stage Real Time Cell History Recorder running JuLI Stage V . 2 . 0 . 1 and JuLI EDIT V . 1 . 0 . 0 . 0 ( NanoEnTek Inc . ) , without staining , meaning only one image was collected for each well and time , showing the full fungi . All imaging was done at 10 √ó magniÔ¨Åcation . Full details on the imaging can be found in Supplementary Information . The snapshots and time - lapse videos were processed diÔ¨Äerently , because a ) the snapshots had spores and germ tubes separated which we took advantage of to automate alignment , and b ) the small number of time - lapse videos meant we could manually align these for higher precision . For processing the snapshot images , we used adaptive binarization ( to account for lighting defects ) to get two images for each view : one of germ tube contours , another of spore contours . Adding these together then gave an image with full fungi . Contours with an area above a threshold found by trial and error were removed as obvious overlapping fungi , and the remaining ones were cropped by Ô¨Ånding the minimum bounding rectangle . These regions of interest ( ROIs ) were rotated to align with the pixel grid and padded so all were 200 √ó 200 pixels , to Ô¨Åt the largest fungi in the set . Incomplete fungi were also removed at the image borders . We then used a supervised convolutional network , trained on a sample of hand - labelled images , to remove contours that contained overlapping fungi . Remaining individual fungi were then translated and rotated so the initial growth directions coincided , and a Ô¨Çip was executed if the right - most point of the fungus was higher than the germination point ( see Supplementary Note 1 ) . Finally , we replaced all spores with identical circles , so as to prioritize modeling of the germ tube ; the resulting morphospace point is then widened into a spore region through the kernel density estimation . For the time - lapse videos , we again binarized the frames ( non - adaptive this time , as there were not signiÔ¨Åcant lighting defects ) . We then found series of contours across frames whose centers of mass were closest , and manually looked through these series to Ô¨Ånd those that corresponded to tracking an individual fungus . We then manually aligned these so that the initial growth directions coincided , this time using ImageJ and Gimp . Before being inputted into the autoencoder , snapshot and time - lapse video pixels were asigned to a value in the set { 0 , 1 } . Full details on the image processing can be found in Supplementary Note 1 . Neural Networks For the autoencoder‚Äôs encoder , we used four convolutional layers with 16 , 32 , 64 and 16 feature maps , all with 3 √ó 3 kernels , ReLU activations , batch normalization , and alternating stride sizes of 1 and 2 in PyTorch . The decoder‚Äôs structure mirrored the encoder‚Äôs , but with transposed convolutions . We used a sigmoid output activation and binary cross entropy loss , over mini - batches of 50 images , and trained for 4 epochs using the Adam optimizer [ 40 ] with a learning rate of 10 ‚àí 4 , which took 2 hours with a Quadro RTX 6000 GPU card . Training was stopped at the point at which the trajectories of the single - fungus videos were least complex . For the PINN , the loss function to be minimized comprizes four terms , with the Ô¨Årst three calculated over random mini - batches of N data points , and the Ô¨Ånal one over the full spatial grid of M data points . The Ô¨Årst is the mean squared diÔ¨Äerence between the learned PDF , ÀÜ p ( x j , t j ) , and data , p ( x j , t j ) , L PDF = 1 N N X j = 1 [ ÀÜ p ( x j , t j ) ‚àí p ( x j , t j ) ] 2 , ( 6 ) with { x j , t j } in the nine snapshots . The second is the mean squared PDF at the boundary , L BC = 1 N N X j = 1 [ ÀÜ p ( x j , t j ) ] 2 ( 7 ) with { x j , t j } selected from 10 6 uniformly distributed boundary points , and the third term is the mean 10 squared PDE residual ( N , given in Eq . 3 ) , L PDE = 1 N N X j = 1 [ N ( ÀÜ p ( x j , t j ) , ÀÜ D ( x j , t j ) , ÀÜ U ( x j ) ) ] 2 , ( 8 ) with { x j , t j } selected from 10 6 points uniformly distributed over the whole domain . The Ô¨Ånal term ensures the PDF integrates to one : L norm = Ô£Æ Ô£∞ M X j = 1 ‚àÜ x 1 ‚àÜ x 2 ÀÜ p ( x j , t ) ‚àí 1 Ô£π Ô£ª 2 , ( 9 ) with x j covering the full spatial grid and t randomly selected . For the total loss ( Eq . 4 ) , we used hyperpa - rameters of 1 , 1 , 500 , 0 . 01 for a , b , c and d , with reasons discussed in Supplementary Note 2 . The three PINN neural networks had 5 fully connected layers , each with 50 neurons , with residual skip connections , and swish activations between layers . Output variables that share inputs ( e . g . the PDF and diÔ¨Äusivity ) can be outputted from a single neural network if they are likely to have similar features , for increased computational eÔ¨Éciency . We used the Adam optimizer [ 40 ] with a learning rate of 5 √ó 10 ‚àí 4 , and batch sizes , N , of 8 , 000 . To speed up training , the DMSO landscape was Ô¨Årst trained for 10 hours , and PINNs for the other conditions were initialized with these weights ( known as transfer learning ) . For forward simulations over the landscapes , particle starting positions were sampled from the initial PDF learned by the PINN , and then simulations were run by evaluating the potential and diÔ¨Äusivity on a 1000 √ó 1000 spatial grid , with 20 snapshots in time for the diÔ¨Äusivity , and simulating Eq . 1 with a time step of 0 . 01 min . Tip Growth Model The 3 - parameter lognormal probability density function is given by f ( x ; s , œÉ 2 , loc ) = 1 œÉ ‚àö 2 œÄ ( x ‚àí loc ) exp log 2 (cid:0) x ‚àí loc s (cid:1) 2 œÉ 2 ( 10 ) where œÉ is a shape parameter , s is a scale parameter ( also the median ) , and loc is a location parameter ( the lower bound ) . The 2 - parameter distribution has loc set to zero . We modeled germination time , t g , as distributed according to t g ‚àº lognormal ( s t g , œÉ t g , loc t g ) , and growth rate , Œ± , as distributed according to Œ± = loc Œ± ‚àí x , with x ‚àº lognormal ( s Œ± , œÉ Œ± , 0 ) and resampling for negative Œ± . Length data was extracted by summing the binarized fungus images , and both the lengthening and bending parameters were Ô¨Åtted using ABC - SMC [ 35 ] . This is a computationally eÔ¨Écient implementation of ABC , identifying intermediate distributions over a series of populations , and gradually decreasing the acceptance threshold . All histograms were compared using the summed absolute distance , and we trained the autoencoder for an extra two epochs with simulations generated randomly from the prior distribution to get coverage of any novel features . We compared three models for tip bending , with Model 3 found to reproduce the data best . For all of the following , œÉ is a noise parameter that was Ô¨Åtted , and dW is the Wiener process . Fig . 4a shows a schematic with the bending angles and curvature . Model 1 was a random walk in the global direction , Œ∏ global , a simple model commonly used in the literature : dŒ∏ global = œÉdW . ( 11 ) Model 2 was a random walk in the curvature of the growth path , Œ∫ , in order to connect to cell tip mechanics : dŒ∫ = œÉdW . ( 12 ) Model 3 was a persistent random walk in the curvature , with an additional parameter , œÑ ‚àí 1 , for relaxation to straight growth , motivated by work analysing Ô¨Åssion yeast tip growth mechanics [ 34 ] : dŒ∫ = ‚àí œÑ ‚àí 1 Œ∫dt + œÉdW .

( a ) An ablation analysis comparing how L total ( running mean over 200 mini - batches ) decreases as training progresses reveals that a diÔ¨Äusivity with both spatial and time dependence is the best model . The majority of the beneÔ¨Åt likely comes from the dynamics in the spore region of morphospace , where diÔ¨Äusion is very high at Ô¨Årst , and then strongly decreases such that not all spores germinate . ( b ) We repeat PINN network training three times for each condition , with diÔ¨Äerent mini - batches , and L total ( running mean over 200 mini - batches ) is shown here for each repeat of DMSO . ( c ) An approximation of the dynamics of the fraction of spores ( ‚âà R spore ÀÜ p ( x , t ) ) across snapshots for DMSO ( with the Ô¨Årst snapshot not shown due to its much higher fraction of spores ) , found by numerically integrating a box around the spore PDF peak . The data is shown in red , and the three repeats have the same coloring as in ( b ) . The PINN Ô¨Årst explores smooth low - frequency solutions , Ô¨Åtting trends common to all snapshots , before ultimately beginning to overÔ¨Åt to the individual snapshots , as shown for one repeat at 60 hours in black . We stop training when the PINN begins to Ô¨Åt to the individual snapshots , which approximately corresponds to 30 , 30 , 30 , 20 , 25 and 25 hours for DMSO and Compounds A , B , C ( 0 . 041 mgL - 1 ) , C ( 10 mgL - 1 ) and X , respectively . ( d ) Sketch of the loss landscape , whereby the global minimum is an overÔ¨Åtted solution , and there may be many equally good solutions before overÔ¨Åtting . ( e ) The landscapes from each of the three repeats after 30 hours of training for DMSO show many common features in the central data - rich region . ( f ) For each of the conditions with signiÔ¨Åcant germination ( i . e . excluding Compound C at 10 mgL - 1 ) , three outputs are shown : the uncertainty in the force magnitude , k F k , calculated from the standard deviation across the three training repeats ; the mean œÉ ( from Eq . 1 ) , averaged over time for the same training repeat as those of the landscapes shown in the other Ô¨Ågures , and only calculated over regions where the PDFs are above 10 ‚àí 3 ; and the uncertainty in œÉ , calculated in the same way as the uncertainty for k F k . All outputs are expressed in terms of morphospace units , m . u .

For each condition ( a - f ) , three panels are shown : the Ô¨Årst panel is the data kernel density estimate ( KDE ) , the second is the KDE over simulations , and the third is the error ( data KDE - simulation KDE ) . All are displayed on a logarithmic scale , and the error is truncated at 10 ‚àí 2 . 5 , which is the probability density generated by a single particle , in order to highlight more systematic errors . For the forward simulations , particle starting positions were sampled from the initial probability distribution learned by the PINN , and then simulations were run by evaluating the potential and diÔ¨Äusivity on a 1000 √ó 1000 spatial grid , with 20 snapshots in time for the diÔ¨Äusivity . The Ô¨Ågure shows good agreement across all conditions , validating the landscapes and diÔ¨Äusivities learned by the PINN . 5 Supplementary Figure 4 : Comparison of simulation and data trajectories l og 10 M S D ( m . u . 2 ) simulationdata simulationdata simulationdata simulationdata DMSO DMSO simulations Compound A Compound B Compound C ( 0 . 041mgL - 1 ) Compound X Œît = 3 min 5 - 10 - 8 8 DMSO Compound B Compound C ( 0 . 041mgL - 1 ) Compound X Compound A Time ( min ) after mixing with solution a c b d 60 min 78 min 96 min 114 min 132 min 150 min ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ simulationdata DMSO A B C X - 0 . 25 - 1 . 2 DMSOCompound A Compound B Compound C ( 0 . 041mgL - 1 ) Compound X E n t r op y ( b i t s ) Time ( min ) after mixing with solution log 10 ( d ) Supplementary Figure 4 : Comparison of simulation and data trajectories .

Syd were prepared in a biosafety class 2 laboratory at Syngenta Stein , Switzerland , as follows : Glycine max ( var . Toliman ) plants were grown for 22 - 25 days in 8 cm pots in substrate with fertilizer . On the day before infection , all leaves except the second trifolium were cut , and plants were watered well . Approx . 30 mg of freshly harvested urediniospores of strain K8108 were suspended in 5 mL of 0 . 05 % ( v / v ) Tween 20 solution in sterile water , and the suspension was diluted to a Ô¨Ånal concentration of 5 √ó 10 4 spores per mL in 100 mL Tween solution . The plants were inoculated inside a sterile bench by spraying the bottom sides of the leaves evenly using an airbrush . Infected plants were then incubated at 22 ¬∞ C , > 90 % relative humidity , in the dark . 24 h post infection , the plants were placed back under light ( 20 K Lux , Metal Halid ) at 22 ¬∞ C day / 20 ¬∞ C night conditions , 70 % relative humidity , and watered every 3 d . Once pustules ( uredinia ) were formed ( usually 10 days post infection ) the leaves were cut oÔ¨Ä and placed inside large Petri dishes containing a moisturized paper towel . The Petri dishes were closed with ParaÔ¨Ålm and incubated for 3 to 4 d in the dark at room temperature . The spores were then detached from the upside - down held leaves inside a biosafety class 2 cabinet by gentle tapping , collected on sterile aluminum foil and used for microscopy assays on the same day . P . pachyrhizi in vitro germination assay for snapshot and time - lapse imaging Chemicals tested were either provided by Syngenta or purchased from Merck KGaA ( Darmstadt , Ger - many ) or other vendors as indicated . Stock solutions were prepared at 10 gL - 1 in DMSO ( Fisher Chem - ical , D / 4121 / PB15 ) : Carbendazim ( CAS - number 10605 - 21 - 7 ; Merck , 45368 - 250MG ) , PIK - 75 ( 2 - Methyl - 5 - nitrobenzenesulfonic acid [ ( 6 - bromoimidazo [ 1 , 2 - a ] pyridin - 3 - yl ) methylene ] methylhydrazide hydrochloride ; CAS - number 372196 - 77 - 5 ; Angene AG00C6HA / AGN - PC - 0RDGQ1 ; stock solution stored frozen at - 80 ¬∞ C in small aliquots ) , Compound X ( Syngenta research compound related to triÔ¨Çuoromethyloxadiazoles [ 1 ] ) , BenzovindiÔ¨Çupyr ( CAS - number 1072957 - 71 - 1 ; Syngenta ) . All compounds tested were diluted to two - fold the Ô¨Ånal concentration in water , either directly from the concentrated stock solutions or from serial 3 - fold dilutions in DMSO . Assay plates in 96 - well format were prepared before the spore suspensions by pipetting 50 ¬µ L of two - fold concentrated treatment solution into the respective wells of CellCarrier - 96 Ultra plates ( PerkinElmer , 6055302 ) . Approx . 20 mg of freshly harvested P . pachyrhizi urediniospores were suspended in 2 mL of 0 . 015 % ( v / v ) Tween 20 in sterile water by shaking in a 5 mL vial ( Axygen , SCT - 5ML - S ) . After determining the spore concentration by using a hemocytometer ( Neubauer improved ) , the required volume of two - fold concentrated suspension with 20 , 000 spores per mL in 0 . 0015 % Tween 20 was prepared . The assay was started immediately by mixing 50 ¬µ L of spore suspension with treatment solution in the 96 - well plates prepared in advance , resulting in a Ô¨Ånal one - fold concentration of the test compounds ( Carbendazim : 1 . 1 mgL - 1 ; PIK - 75 : 3 . 3 mgL - 1 ; Compound X : 1 . 1 mgL - 1 ; BenzovindiÔ¨Çupyr : 0 . 041 and 10 mgL - 1 ) and 1000 spores per well , in a Ô¨Ånal DMSO concentration of 0 . 1 % in all wells . The plates were then incubated in a closed box at 20 ¬∞ C in the dark . After 9 diÔ¨Äerent incubation times between 90 and 210 min in 15 min intervals , 25 ¬µ L CalcoÔ¨Çuor White staining solution ( Merck , 18909 - 100ML - F ) and 25 ¬µ L KOH 10 % ( w / v ) were added to each well to stain the fungal cell walls and simultaneously kill the germlings to enable snapshot imaging . The plates were sealed with adhesive aluminium PCR sealing foil ( Thermo ScientiÔ¨Åc , AB - 0626 ) , mixed well by vortexing , and left at least for 20 min at room temperature to ensure consistent staining and to allow the spores to settle . Imaging on the Opera QEHS High - Content Screening System ( PerkinElmer ) was performed with the following settings for excitation of CalcoÔ¨Çuor White Ô¨Çuorescence ( cell walls of germ tubes ) : 405 nm laser ( 350 ¬µ W ) , 10x air objective lens , 40 ms exposure time , camera bandpass Ô¨Ålter 450 / 50 nm , pixel binning 2 . For the excitation of autoÔ¨Çuorescence of spore hulls ( to diÔ¨Äerentiate them from germ tubes and appressoria ) the following settings were used : 488 nm laser ( 15900 ¬µ W ) , 10x air objective lens , 1 , 600 ms exposure time , camera bandpass Ô¨Ålter 565 / 40 nm , pixel binning 2 . Twelve technical replicate wells were imaged per condition , and 47 images were taken per well at diÔ¨Äerent positions . 11 Germination time - lapse imaging was performed on the JuLI Stage Real - Time Cell History Recorder ( NanoEnTek Inc . ) . The germination assay was set up as described above , but after mixing spores with treatment solutions the assay plates were incubated directly in the imaging device , which itself was placed inside of a climate cabinet set to 20 ¬∞ C . Imaging started with an autofocus run , followed by 321 runs with 3 min intervals to cover germination between + 1 and + 17 h after setup . No replicate wells were prepared to minimize interval times , but 5 diÔ¨Äerent spots were imaged per well . The transmission light LED and the 10x objective were used with settings : 15 ms exposure time , LED power ‚Äú3‚Äù , brightness correction ‚Äú10‚Äù . Image Processing The size of the snapshot image sets necessitated fully - automated processing . We extracted fungus contours using adaptive binarization , where the threshold value varies based on the statistics of a surrounding window . We used 100 √ó 100 windows ( the approximate size of lighting defects ) out of full images of 503 √ó 685 pixels , and the threshold point was found from the cross correlation of this area with a Gaussian window , and shifted with biases of 30 and 0 out of the [ 0 , 255 ] pixel range for the germ tube and spore images , respectively ( found through trial and error ) . See the adaptiveThreshold function in OpenCV . This yielded two images per view : one with spore contours , and another with germ tube contours . Adding these together then gave an image with full fungi . Contours in this combined image with an area above a threshold found by trial and error were removed as obvious overlapping fungi , and the remainder were cropped by Ô¨Ånding the minimum bounding rectangle ( using OpenCV‚Äôs minAreaRect function ) , and rotating to align with the pixel grid ( using OpenCV‚Äôs warpAÔ¨Éne function with bilinear interpolation ) with padding so all were 200 √ó 200 regions of interest ( ROIs ) , to Ô¨Åt the largest fungi in the set . Incomplete fungi were also removed by detecting if any of their outline points touched the image border . We then used a supervised convolutional neural network to remove overlapping morphologies , given a set of hand - labelled examples . Single - fungus images were then translated and rotated so the initial growth directions coincided , and a Ô¨Çip was executed if the right - most point of the fungus was higher than the germination point . To do this alignment , we utilized the fact that there was one image of the spores , and another of the germ tubes for each view , and that these two contours overlapped slightly . The fungi were all translated so the points at which the germ tube hit the spore coincided . This point was found to be the center of mass of the overlap of the spore and germ tube contours . Since the germ tubes grow out perpendicular to the spore surface , alignment of the initial germination direction was then achieved by rotating the line joining the two points where the germ tube contour hit the spore to be vertical . These two points were found by tracing from the point on the germ tube contour furthest from the spore - germ tube intersection point in opposite directions until the spore was hit . We replaced all spores with identical circles , so as to prioritize modeling of the germ tube ; the resulting morphospace point is then widened into a spore region through the kernel density estimation . We removed overlapping fungi , which we note means larger morphologies are more likely to be removed than smaller ones ( e . g . ungerminated spores ) , leading to a slight bias towards smaller morphologies . However , the DMSO data shows that there is very little germination after the Ô¨Årst snapshot , which would lead to an artiÔ¨Åcially increasing percentage of spores if the bias was signiÔ¨Åcant , which Supplemetary Fig . 1c does not show ; instead , the inter - snapshot variability is the much more dominant factor . In other words , the variance in the latent variables that cause inter - snapshot variability dominates over the slight bias induced by removing overlapping fungi . In future , however , this slight bias can be resolved by using more sophisticated segmentation algorithms that can resolve overlapping morphologies [ 2 ] , which would also increase the amount of data extracted per image . For the time - lapse videos , we again binarized ( using trial and error for a suitable threshold value , and without adaptive binarization , since there were not signiÔ¨Åcant lighting defects ) , and found the fungus con - tours . We then found series of contours across frames whose center of mass were closest , and manually looked through these to Ô¨Ånd those that corresponded to tracking an individual fungus . We then used ImageJ to color over the spore with the background color ( black background , white fungi ) , and aligned all germination points ( found simply as the intersection point on the initial full - fungus contour image and the new contour image with the germ tube only ) . We then manually rotated and ( where neccessary ) Ô¨Çipped the images using Gimp , to ensure the initial growth directions coincided . Before being inputted into the autoencoder , snapshot and time - lapse video pixels were assigned to a value in the set { 0 , 1 } . 12 Supplementary Note 2 : Autoencoder and PINN Neural Networks Autoencoder architecture and training For the autoencoder‚Äôs encoder , we used four convolutional layers with 16 , 32 , 64 and 16 feature maps , all with 3 √ó 3 kernels , ReLU activations , batch normalization , and alternating stride sizes of 1 and 2 . The decoder‚Äôs structure mirrored the encoder‚Äôs , but with transposed convolutions . We used a sigmoid output activation and binary cross entropy loss , over mini - batches of 50 images , and trained for 4 epochs using the Adam optimizer [ 3 ] with a learning rate of 10 ‚àí 4 , which took 2 hours with a Quadro RTX 6000 GPU card . Training was stopped at the point at which the trajectories of the single - fungus videos were least complex . Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) is a commonly - used linear dimensionality technique that Ô¨Ånds a set of orthogonal features based on the data variance in diÔ¨Äerent directions . While this method can Ô¨Ånd very interpretable features , non - linear methods can be more expressive , capturing curved data manifolds to describe the data in fewer dimensions . This non - linearity is particularly useful for our work , as it allows us to Ô¨Ånd a 2D morphospace , which then enables intuitive visualization of the Fokker - Planck model landscapes . t - distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ( t - SNE , [ 4 ] ) is another commonly - used non - linear dimen - sionality reduction algorithm that could be used for Ô¨Ånding the morphospace , and for characterizing mor - phodynamics with the Fokker - Planck model . However , this algorithm is non - parametric , meaning that when new data is added , it must be re - run in full , and so is not well - suited for the implementation of approximate Bayesian inference on mechanistic model parameters . If the autoencoder is too small ( i . e . shallow or narrow ) , the embedding function may be too simple to capture curved data manifolds . For example , autoencoders with single hidden layer and linear activation functions can only learn linear features . However , if the network is too large , it can reconstruct the data without needing to closely describe the underlying manifold . This can be thought of as a form of overÔ¨Åtting . For higher - dimensional latent spaces , this can be a more signiÔ¨Åcant problem , and so autoencoder variants that regularize the latent space are typically used , for example the Variational Autoencoder ( VAE ) [ 5 ] , which imposes a Gaussian prior distribution over the latent space . These ensure the latent space is smooth , with meaningful features throughout . We found that the autoencoder architecture used here was suitable for capturing the data manifold , and avoided variants like the VAE because they warped fungus trajectories that were more natural with a standard autoencoder . Learning landscapes from snapshot data For the PINN , the loss function to be minimized comprizes four terms , with the Ô¨Årst three calculated over random mini - batches of N data points , and the Ô¨Ånal one over the full spatial grid of M data points . The Ô¨Årst is the mean squared diÔ¨Äerence between the learned PDF , ÀÜ p ( x j , t j ) , and data , p ( x j , t j ) , L PDF = 1 N N X j = 1 [ ÀÜ p ( x j , t j ) ‚àí p ( x j , t j ) ] 2 , ( S1 ) with { x j , t j } in the nine snapshots . The second is the mean squared PDF at the boundary , L BC = 1 N N X j = 1 [ ÀÜ p ( x j , t j ) ] 2 ( S2 ) with { x j , t j } selected from 10 6 uniformly distributed boundary points , and the third term is the mean squared PDE residual ( N , given in Eq . 3 ) , L PDE = 1 N N X j = 1 [ N ( ÀÜ p ( x j , t j ) , ÀÜ D ( x j , t j ) , ÀÜ U ( x j ) ) ] 2 , ( S3 ) with { x j , t j } selected from 10 6 points uniformly distributed over the whole domain . The Ô¨Ånal term ensures the PDF integrates to one : L norm = Ô£Æ Ô£∞ M X j = 1 ‚àÜ x 1 ‚àÜ x 2 ÀÜ p ( x j , t ) ‚àí 1 Ô£π Ô£ª 2 , ( S4 ) 13 with x j covering the full spatial grid and t randomly selected . For the total loss ( Eq . 4 ) , we used hyperparameters of 1 , 1 , 500 , 0 . 01 for a , b , c and d . Previous work using PINNs to solve the Fokker - Planck equation [ 6 , 7 ] used a weighting for L PDE of 100 , and the same values for the other hyperparameters as we used . Since our data was of snapshots of diÔ¨Äerent spore batches , we increased the weighting to 500 , to prioritize more the PDE Ô¨Åtting over the data . While initially selected by trial and error through inspecting single particle forward simulations , this choice was later vindicated quantitatively . We trained the DMSO PINN with c values of 50 , 500 and 5000 for 10 hours each . Since changing the hyperparameters modiÔ¨Åes the loss calculation , L total cannot be used to test the quality of the inferred parameters . Instead , we compared the resulting Ô¨Åts of single particle simulations of Eq . 1 with the data through the mean absolute probability error on the grid ( MAE ) . Particle starting positions were sampled from the initial PDF learned by the PINN , and then simulations were run by evaluating the potential and diÔ¨Äusivity on a 1000 √ó 1000 spatial grid , with 20 snapshots in time for the diÔ¨Äusivity , with a time step of 0 . 01 min . The MAE values for c values of 50 , 500 and 5000 were 9 . 8 √ó 10 ‚àí 6 , 9 . 0 √ó 10 ‚àí 6 and 9 . 9 √ó 10 ‚àí 6 respectively , showing 500 was a suitable choice for c , as it produced the model with the best Ô¨Åt to the data . Reducing the relative weighting of the data penalty means there is no longer a guarantee of the learned PDF integrating to one , and so a normalization penalty is required . The weighting for L norm of 0 . 01 was found to normalize the data adequately , without excessively prioritising this constraint , in agreement with the Ô¨Åndings of [ 6 , 7 ] . Since P . pachyrhizi were Ô¨Åxated upon staining , the snapshots were of distinct populations . There are therefore latent variables that change the dynamics for each population . Ideally , the learned solution would be the average dynamics of inÔ¨Ånite repeats . Since neural networks learn smooth low - frequency solutions Ô¨Årst , we used early stopping to capture average dynamics , rather than letting the dynamics Ô¨Åt exactly to each snapshot , primarily watching for when the PINN began to Ô¨Åt individual snapshots . This point approximately corresponded to 30 , 30 , 30 , 20 , 25 and 25 hours for DMSO and Compounds A , B , C ( 0 . 041 mgL - 1 ) , C ( 10 mgL - 1 ) and X , respectively . For small numbers of snapshots , it is possible that spurious patterns emerge not only on the single - snapshot level , but also across many snapshots ; for example if two subsequent snapshots have similar low - probability latent variables , this will be captured by the PINN . However , such patterns become increasingly less problematic as the number of snapshots increases . An alternative solution is to constrain the solution physically , as we did with the tip growth model . The three neural networks had 5 fully connected layers , each with 50 neurons , with residual skip connec - tions , and swish activations between layers . A softplus output activation was used for the PDF , and sigmoid was used for the potential and diÔ¨Äusivity , with the potential multiplied by 3 to give a [ 0 , 3 ] output range . This sigmoid constraint prevents unphysical solutions that can arise with unbounded force and diÔ¨Äusivity . Output variables that share inputs ( e . g . the PDF and diÔ¨Äusivity ) can be outputted from a single neural network if they are likely to have similar features , for increased computational eÔ¨Éciency . We used the Adam optimizer [ 3 ] with a learning rate of 5 √ó 10 ‚àí 4 , and batch sizes , N , of 8 , 000 . To speed up training , the DMSO landscape was Ô¨Årst trained for 10 hours , and PINNs for the other conditions were initialized with these weights ( known as transfer learning ) . The landscapes for DMSO and Compound A formed deep bowls at the outer morphospace regions . For visualization , we therefore scaled landscape regions outside the PDF boundary of 10 ‚àí 3 towards the closest point on this boundary and applied a Gaussian smoothing to this outer region . This way , the full landscape can be easily compared with the morphospace , but with decreased gradients in regions where there is not signiÔ¨Åcant data density . This is a purely cosmetic choice , and the original landscapes can also be viewed unedited , since the translucency does enable viewing of valley regions . There are two sources of stochasticity in the fungus trajectories over the landscapes , which we call morphodynamic diÔ¨Äusion and embedding noise , both of which are consumed into the diÔ¨Äusion term of the Fokker - Planck model . Morphodynamic diÔ¨Äusion is the fundamental unpredictability of morphodynamics over time , arising from un - modeled internal and external factors that vary across fungi . This corresponds to diÔ¨Äusion over the approximately 2D morphological manifold within the high - dimensional pixel space . Embedding noise arises from fungi being randomly perturbed away from the 2D morphology manifold in the high - dimensional pixel space . Such perturbations arise from factors including image resolution , segmentation and alignment ( which for example add extra degrees of freedom to the images , and each degree of freedom expand the data manifold dimensionality ) , and the complexity of the autoencoder‚Äôs embedding function means these perturbations are not always just mapped to the closest point on the manifold . Since the same 14 image pre - processing algorithms were used on all conditions , diÔ¨Äerences in the Fokker - Planck diÔ¨Äusion over the same region of morphospace will be morphodynamic in nature , rather than arising from the embedding noise . Supplementary Note 3 : Three Models of Tip Growth The minimal model for fungus growth was composed of two equations : one for lengthening and another for tip bending , and we ran model selection on three candidate models for the bending part . For fungus lengthening , we used the 3 - parameter lognormal distribution to model both germination time , t g , and growth rate , Œ± . The probability density function of the 3 - parameter lognormal distribution is given by f ( x ; s , œÉ 2 , loc ) = 1 œÉ ‚àö 2 œÄ ( x ‚àí loc ) exp log 2 (cid:0) x ‚àí loc s (cid:1) 2 œÉ 2 ( S5 ) where œÉ is a shape parameter , s is a scale parameter ( also the median ) , and loc is a location parameter ( the lower bound ) . The 2 - parameter distribution has loc set to zero . We modeled germination time , t g , as distributed according to t g ‚àº lognormal ( s t g , œÉ t g , loc t g ) , and growth rate , Œ± , as distributed according to Œ± = loc Œ± ‚àí x , with x ‚àº lognormal ( s Œ± , œÉ Œ± , 0 ) and resampling for negative Œ± . For inferring both the lengthening and bending parameters , we used ABC - SMC [ 8 ] . This is a computa - tionally eÔ¨Écient implementation of ABC , identifying intermediate distributions over a series of populations , and gradually decreasing the acceptance threshold . All histograms were compared using the summed abso - lute distance , and we trained the autoencoder for an extra two epochs with simulations generated randomly from the prior distribution to get coverage of any novel features . For inferring lengthening parameters ( s t g , œÉ t g , loc t g , s Œ± , œÉ Œ± , loc Œ± ) , we ran ABC - SMC with a population size of 100 , each with 5000 simulations , for 4 steps . All prior distributions were uniform distributions over the following ranges : s t g : [ 0 . 01 , 150 ] , œÉ t g : [ 0 . 01 , 5 ] , loc t g : [ 20 , 100 ] , s Œ± : [ 0 . 01 , 2 ] , œÉ Œ± : [ 0 . 01 , 1 ] , loc Œ± : [ 0 . 3 , 1 . 5 ] . We compared three models for tip bending , and used ABC - SMC for both model selection and parameter inference . As described in the main text , the comparison was done using both the fungus length data and 210 min morphospace embeddings , and Model 3 was found to reproduce the data best . For all of the following , œÉ is a noise parameter that was Ô¨Åtted , and dW is the Wiener process . Model 1 was a random walk in the global direction , Œ∏ global , a simple model commonly used in the literature : dŒ∏ global = œÉdW . ( S6 ) Model 2 was a random walk in the curvature of the growth path , Œ∫ , in order to connect to cell tip mechanics : dŒ∫ = œÉdW . ( S7 ) Model 3 was a persistent random walk in the curvature , with an additional parameter for relaxation to straight growth , œÑ ‚àí 1 , motivated by work analysing Ô¨Åssion yeast tip growth mechanics [ 9 ] : dŒ∫ = ‚àí œÑ ‚àí 1 Œ∫dt + œÉdW . ( S8 ) Models 2 and 3 can be loosely connected to a diÔ¨Äusing growth zone at the tip as has been described in Ô¨Åssion yeast [ 9 ] , by introducing an angular growth zone position , Œ∏ tip , and a mapping , Œ∫ = f ( Œ∏ tip ) , where f is unknown , but likely monotonically increasing , and passing through the origin ( i . e . a central growth zone corresponds to straight growth ) . For Ô¨Åtting the bending parameters using ABC - SMC , images were created by taking the MAP lengthening parameters , running the model , and then converting to Cartesian coordinates using the relation dŒ∏ global dt = dLdt dŒ∏ global dL = Œ±Œ∫ , such that : x N + 1 = x N + Œ± ‚àÜ t cos (cid:16)P Nn = 0 Œ±Œ∫ ‚àÜ t (cid:17) ( S9 ) y N + 1 = y N + Œ± ‚àÜ t sin (cid:16)P Nn = 0 Œ±Œ∫ ‚àÜ t (cid:17) . ( S10 ) 15 Coordinates were then converted to images using the polylines function in OpenCV . For selecting the optimal bending model , we ran ABC - SMC with a population size of 40 , each with 1000 simulations , for 9 steps . All prior distributions were uniform distributions over the following ranges : Model 1 , œÉ : [ 0 , 0 . 2 ] ; Model 2 , œÉ : [ 0 , 0 . 01 ] ; Model 3 , œÉ : [ 0 , 0 . 05 ] , œÑ ‚àí 1 : [ 0 , 0 . 2 ] . For subsequently inferring the bending parameters of Model 3 , we used a population size of 40 , each with 1000 simulations , and ran for 4 steps using the same prior distributions as for model selection . Supplementary Note 4 : Possible Modes of Action The compounds were identiÔ¨Åed at pre - screening by eye to show a range of phenotypes . Compound A ( methyl benzimidazol - 2 - ylcarbamate ) is a widely - used fungicide that inhibits the assembly of tubulin subunits into functional microtubules , which are an essential part of the cytoskeleton [ 10 ] . Micro - tubules participate in maintaining the shape of cells , the distribution of organelles , the transport of materials within the cell , and in the separation of chromosomes during mitosis . The bending of germ tubes that we observe may be in part induced by disturbed vesicle transport towards the growing hyphal tip , although there is likely a range of causes . Compound B ( PIK - 75 hydrochloride ) is a phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor . PI3Ks are compo - nents of certain signaling pathways , which control growth , metabolism and other functions . PIK - 75 comes from the pharmaceutical industry and is technically not a fungicide . The fungal target is unknown , but if it inhibits fungal PI3K , then the observed phenotype could be due to the disturbance of cellular signaling required for normal tip growth . Compound C ( benzovindiÔ¨Çupyr ) has complex II of the respiratory chain as the target , and consequently an inhibition can lead to a depletion of energy . Therefore , depending on the concentration , the cell will stop growth because it lacks the ability to produce the required metabolites . Compound X ( a Syngenta research compound related to triÔ¨Çuoromethyloxadiazoles [ 1 ] , see Fig . 7 for the chemical structure ) is an inhibitor of a histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) . Histones are proteins that interact with nuclear DNA , and HDACs are enzymes that remove acetyl groups from histones . As a result , the DNA is packed more tightly , which has an inÔ¨Çuence on gene expression . HDAC - inhibitors result in de - regulation of this control mechanism for gene expression , however it is unknown why P . phakopsora germlings react to this compound in the observed manner . Supplementary Methods Python was used for all computing , with the OpenCV library [ 11 ] used for processing the snapshot images , and for data - driven development of the tip growth model . We manually built the PINN architecture using TensorÔ¨Çow 2 [ 12 ] , however there is now a full PINN Python package , DeepXDE [ 13 ] . A Quadro RTX 6000 GPU card was used to speed up neural network training and inference . Finally , we used the pyABC library [ 14 ] for parameter Ô¨Åtting of the tip growth model with ABC - SMC , the computationally eÔ¨Écient implementation of approximate Bayesian computation .
