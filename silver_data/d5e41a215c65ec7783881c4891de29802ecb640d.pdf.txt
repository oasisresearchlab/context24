With increasing efforts to bring com - puting education opportunities into elementary schools , there is a growing need for assessments , with arguments for validity , to support research evaluation at these grade levels . After success - fully piloting a 10 - question computational thinking assessment ( Assessment of Computing for Elementary Students – ACES ) for 4th graders in Spring 2020 , we used our analyses of item difficulty and discrimination to iterate on the assessment . Objectives . To increase the number of potential items for ACES , we created isomorphic versions of existing questions . The nature of the changes varied from incidental changes that we did not be - lieve would impact student performance to more radical changes that seemed likely to influence question difficulty . We sought to understand the impact of these changes on student performance . Method . Using these isomorphic questions , we created two ver - sions of our assessment and piloted them in Spring 2021 with 235 upper - elementary ( 4th grade ) students . We analyzed the reliability of the assessments using Cronbach’s alpha . We used Chi - squared tests to analyze questions that were identical across the two assess - ments to form a baseline of comparison and then ran Chi - Squared and Kruskal - Wallis H tests to analyze the differences between the isomorphic copies of the questions . Findings . Both assessment versions demonstrated good reliability , with identical Cronbach’s alphas of 0 . 868 . We found statistically similar performance on the identical questions between our two groups of students , allowing us to compare their performance on the isomorphic questions . Students performed differently on the isomorphic questions , indicating the changes to the questions had a differential impact on student performance . Implications . This paper builds on existing work by presenting methods for creating isomorphic questions .

As CT is integrated into more domains and across the K - 12 grade levels [ 24 ] , questions arise over how to reliably assess CT and how to build valid assessments around this concept . There is no agreed - upon definition of CT [ 39 ] , which means that for each CT definition , at each grade level , and within each new domain there are opportunities for even more CT assessments [ 40 ] . This is all further complicated by the time and effort it takes to make validated instruments of knowledge in computing ( e . g . , [ 29 , 41 ] ) . Previously , we embarked on developing a CT assessment to fit our definition ( loops and sequences ) , grade level ( 4th ) , and domain ( multilingual students ) . To evaluate the performance of students in our CT curriculum [ 38 ] , we constructed and piloted a 10 - question assessment on loops and sequences , the Assessment of Comput - ing for Elementary Students ( ACES ) [ 30 ] . Although the reliability , as measured by Cronbach’s alpha , of the assessment was in an acceptable range for early - stage research , we needed to improve the reliability if we wanted to use the assessment to more rigor - ously evaluate our curriculum . Reliability is important , as it can approximate the relationship among the individual items on the assessment , ensuring internal consistency [ 1 ] . For reference , the term ‘items’ is generally synonymous with questions , though we 2 ICER 2022 , August 7 – 11 , 2022 , Lugano and Virtual Event , Switzerland Parker , et al . will discuss where the two terms diverge for our assessment in Section 3 . 2 . This paper reports on the next stage of our research into CT assessment creation . Assessment reliability can be improved over - all by improving individual items on the assessment , as well as by increasing the number of items [ 1 ] . Cronbach’s alpha is calculated , in part , by considering the number of items [ 11 ] . We set out to grow the number of items we could use by creating isomorphic versions of the original questions . We chose to create isomorphic versions of existing questions , rather than solely create new questions , be - cause of the intentional , time - intensive efforts taken to construct the original questions from sequences and repetition learning tra - jectories [ 36 ] . We divided the new questions across two different test forms so that we could field test this larger number of items without overly burdening any individual student . Test forms had items in common ( i . e . , were identical on both test forms ) as well as questions that were isomorphic . While we also worked to improve reliability by revising questions we had previously identified as problematic , those efforts are not detailed here . This paper details the process of creating the isomorphic ques - tions , piloting the questions on two versions of ACES , and the analysis of 235 upper - elementary students’ responses across the two forms . Our research questions were : RQ1 : What effect do different isomorphic changes have on the relia - bility of two forms of an assessment ? RQ2 : What effect do different isomorphic changes have on student performance among comparable student populations ? 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 Elementary Computational Thinking Assessments Few assessments measure computing and CT abilities among ele - mentary students . We previously used the CSEdResearch . org data - base to find and review evaluation instruments that assess com - puting content knowledge of young children : Project Quantum [ 34 ] and Project TREES [ 9 ] . Since our original publication on this assessment [ 30 ] , three additional measures can be found using the CSEdResearch database to search for elementary CT assessments . One measure is the Computational Thinking Assessment ( CTA ) , which measures algorithms , loops , and debugging among third - grade students [ 42 ] , as described by Brennan and Resnick’s CT framework , ISTE , and CSTA standards [ 7 , 15 ] . The CTA consists of 10 questions with five algorithmic tasks , three debugging chal - lenges , one yes / no scenario , and one open - ended question . Though the assessment resulted in low internal reliability , they found that a one - step process as opposed to a two - step , multi - task approach was less confusing for the young age group [ 42 ] . Another measure is TechCheck , which was designed to measure CT domains ( e . g . algorithms , modularity , control structures , representation , hard - ware / software , debugging ) without requiring prior knowledge of computer programming [ 4 , 35 ] . TechCheck consists of 15 multiple - choice questions composed of various “unplugged” or technology - free tasks such as puzzles , mazes , and sequencing . TechCheck re - sulted in acceptable criterion validity and reliability for first - and second - grade students [ 35 ] . The final assessment in the database is the Coding Stages Assessment ( CSA ) , which measures the de - velopment of coding literacy using a five - stage learning trajectory for four - to seven - year - olds [ 3 , 14 ] . As students progress through the stages , they demonstrate greater mastery of both understand - ing and writing code . The CSA uses 25 open - ended questions in ScratchJr to determine the coding stage of learners . The CSA ques - tions are verbal and task - based questions , which differs from the forced - choice approach of the CTA and TechCheck . In addition to the instruments in the CSEdResearch . org database , there are assessments found in the literature that are scoped for elementary students learning computing concepts . The Beginners Computational Thinking Test ( BCTt ) [ 46 ] , designed for primary school students , is an adapted version of the Computation Think - ing Test ( CTt ) [ 37 ] , which was created for middle school students . Developed for upper elementary students , the CT Practices assess - ment [ 2 ] focuses on CT practices , rather than concepts , outlined by Brennan and Resnick [ 7 ] . There are also assessments that have been used to measure 3rd and 4th graders’ understandings of sequences , conditionals , repetition , and decomposition in the context of an integrated math - CT curriculum [ 25 ] . While all these assessments address the need for evaluation tools at the primary level , there is not yet an assessment that meets our conceptual needs at the fourth - grade level . 2 . 2 Isomorphic Questions Isomorphic questions are created such that certain elements are the same or similar [ 5 ] . Assessment developers often create isomorphic questions when intending to create two psychometrically equiva - lent test forms . Isomorphic questions have been used in computing education research to evaluate different aspects of peer instruction in computer science courses , such as investigating the effect of peer discussion on learning [ 33 ] or exploring long - term retention of learning [ 48 ] . The creation of similar , but still different , ques - tions has also been used in the literature to mitigate cheating on CS assessments [ 8 , 16 ] . Isomorphic questions were pivotal in the replication of the Foundational CS1 ( FCS1 ) assessment to create the Second CS1 ( SCS1 ) assessment [ 29 ] . In all of these works , the isomorphic questions kept the concept being assessed , with the SCS1 replication work also maintaining the style of the question . However , other elements , such as the text of the prompt and answer choices , are subject to changes . In computing education research , there are several different ways to refer to items that are changed but still structurally similar . Some papers only refer to this change as being ‘isomorphic’ [ 29 , 33 , 48 ] , whereas other papers refer to these as ‘surface feature changes’ [ 16 ] or ‘question variants’ [ 8 ] . Due to this branching in the language around question changes , related work can be difficult to bring together on this topic . We choose to use the term ‘isomorphic’ as it is more commonly used in the education literature . Using isomorphic questions to create parallel test forms was first recommended and tested by Clause et al . [ 10 ] . Lievens and Sackett [ 23 ] extended this work and defined different ways of creating iso - morphic questions by applying the radicals - incidentals approach to item generation . Radicals , also called controlling factors , are item features that affect item difficulty . For a math problem , radicals might include the specific concepts being tested , the magnitude 3 A Pair of ACES : An Analysis of Isomorphic Questions on an Elementary Computing Assessment ICER 2022 , August 7 – 11 , 2022 , Lugano and Virtual Event , Switzerland of the numbers used , and whether the problem is contextualized ( e . g . , a story problem ) or decontextualized ( e . g . , solving an equa - tion ) . Incidentals , also called noncontrolling or nuisance factors , are item features that do not affect item difficulty . For a math problem , incidentals might include the names of students used in a story problem or other superficial elements within the story context . Using Lievins and Sackett’s terminology , a pair of items is item isomorphic if you assume that the item’s underlying constructs and the item context ( i . e . , the item stem and answer options ) are both radicals , and only minor changes to the problem presentation are made . Another approach would be to assume that only the under - lying constructs are radicals and that changes to the item stem and answer options are incidental . Lievins and Sackett referred to this as incident isomorphic because they were studying a specific type of item , the Situational Judgment Test , that contains a " critical incident " that respondents react to [ 23 ] . In this paper , we will refer to these types of isomorphisms as construct isomorphic . Although item writers may have a priori ideas about what item features constitute radicals vs . incidentals , research suggests that it can be difficult to predict what changes will impact item diffi - culty . For example , Fowler et al . found that permutations to the surface feature of a question ( such as changing function or variable names ) did not result in significant differences in the difficulty of the question [ 16 ] . Similarly , Weston et al . found that changing the species of plant used in a biology question on photosynthesis does not change the content of the student responses [ 43 ] . These are both examples of item isomorphisms . However , seemingly superficial changes can cause differences in student performance . Even if isomorphic questions result in similar scores , different amounts of time or effort may be required to an - swer each question [ 8 ] . Hayes and Simon investigated 13 different isomorphic versions of a Tower of Hanoi problem and found that isomorphic versions that change the context ( e . g . from pegs and disks to flagpoles and acrobats ) took three times as long to solve as the standard Tower of Hanoi question [ 19 ] . These differences in completion time vary even more with other changes , where some isomorphic questions took 16 times as long to complete as the origi - nal problem [ 19 ] . The effects of small changes to create isomorphic questions can also be seen in the SCS1 replication work , where some items change in their difficulty level between the original FCS1 and the replicated SCS1 assessment [ 29 ] . Although it is clear that changes in questions can create changes in performance , the underlying mechanism that causes these shifts is not always clear . Seemingly superficial changes in an item’s con - text can cause students to recruit different knowledge and cognitive processes when solving a problem . Kotovsky et al . investigated the Tower of Hanoi problems and developed several hypotheses for the mechanisms behind the varying performance , including spatial memory load , real - world knowledge , and the use of external repre - sentations [ 21 ] . The context of a question has also been shown to have a significant impact on student performance , such as when students don’t recognize that two problems , with different contexts , are fundamentally the same problem [ 17 ] . Similarly , previous stud - ies in math education have shown that students perform differently on problems with the same underlying mathematics if one problem is contextualized and the other is decontextualized [ 20 ] or if the Table 1 : The questions and their response type on each form of the assessment . Questions unique to each assessment are not included in this analysis and are left blank in this table . # Form A Response Form B Response q3 ID1 Multi - select q4 ID2 Multiple - choice q5 ID1 Multi - select q6 ID2 Multiple - choice ID3 Multi - select q7 ID3 Multi - select ID4 Multiple - choice q8 ID4 Multiple - choice ID5 Multiple - choice q9 ID5 Multiple - choice q10 IS1 Multiple - choice IS1 Multiple - choice q12 IS2 Multiple - choice IS2 Multiple - choice q13 IS3 Multiple - choice IS3 Multi - select q14 IS4 Ordering IS4 Ordering q15 IS5 Multi - select IS5 Multi - select q16 IS6 Multi - select IS6 Multi - select manipulatives used in the problem are unrealistic [ 27 ] . Kyllonen [ 22 ] wrote : How is it that we know which factors are radical and which incidental ? One approach , and it seems the most common one , is to designate certain item fac - tors incidental a priori . . . . The problem is that these a priori incidentals could turn out to be important determinants of item difficulty . . . . This suggests that the radical - incidental distinction could at least be par - tially empirically determined . ( p . 261 ) Thus , it is critical to analyze isomorphic questions to understand just how similar or different they are , as making seemingly minor changes can still have significant effects on student performance . In the remainder of this paper , we describe how we constructed isomorphic items , how student performance did or did not differ across pairs of isomorphic items , and what these differences might mean for constructing assessments of computational thinking . 3 METHODS In this section , we first describe how we created the two isomorphic versions of the assessment . Then , we detail the study context and population . We refer to questions by “ID” or “IS” followed by a number , where “ID” stands for identical questions and “IS” stands for isomorphic questions . A full summary of the questions can be found in Table 1 . 3 . 1 Building Isomorphic Questions On the original assessment , each question was written to measure sequences , loops , or a combination of sequences and loops . The questions included two different prompt types : code blocks or story - style . Code block questions used blocks created via the Scratch Blocks 1 interface to make the blocks easier to interpret for 4th - grade students ( e . g . using " turn right " instead of " rotate 90 degrees , " such as shown in Figure 1 ) . Story - style questions were presented in 1 https : / / scratchblocks . github . io / 4 ICER 2022 , August 7 – 11 , 2022 , Lugano and Virtual Event , Switzerland Parker , et al . a story context , without the presence of any code in the question or answer choices ( such as in Figure 6 ) . These questions are styled after the Bebras tasks [ 12 , 13 ] but are not a part of the official set of Bebras challenge questions . When creating our isomorphic questions , we followed the steps taken by Parker et al . and maintained the construct being tested and how it is tested [ 29 ] . We first identified six questions that seemed easy to create isomorphisms for , which we defined as being able to change the context with few other changes . All of these questions involved navigating an animal ( e . g . ladybug ) to an object ( e . g . leaf ) on a two - dimensional ( 2 - D ) grid . Four of these were questions that used code blocks , whereas the other two questions were story - style questions . We outline the six questions selected for isomorphic adaptation and the changes made to create the isomorphic versions in Table 2 , and describe each in more detail below . We used combinations of the following changes to create the isomorphic versions of each of these six items : Changes to the item stem • Grid dimensions / orientation . We changed the size of the grid along at least one dimension . In the case of IS1 , we kept the grid the same size but changed the orientation of the grid from landscape to portrait . • Path shape / length . We changed the shape of the path the animal took on the grid by changing the length of one or more path segments . • Path direction . We kept the path shape the same ( i . e . , the same number and length of path segments ) , but the animal traveled the path in a different direction . Changes to the answer choices • Order . We kept the answer choices the same but presented them in an alternate order . • Content . We provided different answer choices for each of the isomorphs . In the case of IS4 , this change was very minor , simply changing one word on one block to read " left " instead of " right " to accommodate the change in path direction . • Response style . We changed the response style of one ques - tion , from a multi - select question that had multiple right answers to a multiple - choice question with a single right answer . In doing this , we also changed the number of options students had to consider . In all cases , we changed the environment illustrations for the item , for example by taking an item that featured a sea turtle on a beach moving towards the ocean and changing it to a bunny on grass moving towards a carrot ( see Figure 1 ) . Whether these changes to the item stem and answer choices constitute radical or incidental changes ( i . e . , did we create item isomorphs or construct isomorphs ? ) will be answered empirically in Section 5 . We detail each isomorphic question below , with accompanying figures . While the images presented in this paper are static , the images on the actual assessment are animations , depicting the steps that students should mimic with the answer choice ( s ) they select . 3 . 1 . 1 IS1 . IS1 , as seen in Figure 1 , is a multiple - choice question on sequences and uses code blocks . On Form A , this question involved a turtle heading across the sand to seaweed in the ocean , while Form B depicted a bunny on grass moving towards a carrot . We used this question to explore whether the orientation of the grid would impact student performance on the question . As such , Form A had a landscape grid ( i . e . , wider than it is tall ) which meant the turtle moved from left to right more than it did vertically . Form B had a portrait grid ( i . e . , taller than it is wide ) which meant the bunny moved more from the bottom of the grid to the top than it did horizontally . As a result of the change in grid orientation , the starting and ending positions of the sprite also changed . 3 . 1 . 2 IS2 . IS2 , as seen in Figure 2 , is a multiple - choice question on loops and sequences and uses code blocks . The accompanying ani - mation for this question shows the sprite moving the steps shown by the repeat block , but pausing to allow students to determine how to move towards to goal object and , consequently , what code blocks are required to make that movement . The grid orientation was the same , but the size of the grid differed between the two versions . The animals in each question also started at different positions , requiring the turtle to turn left but the bunny to turn right . As such , the steps to the goal object , and thus the correct answer to the question , differed between the two versions . We made these changes to explore if one direction might be easier than the other or if the size of a grid affected student performance on the question . 3 . 1 . 3 IS3 . IS3 is a code - based loops and sequences question that can be seen in Figure 3 . This question had the most significant changes between the two versions . While both questions asked the students to select the code that would make the animal move towards the object , and both questions had identical grid sizes and orientations , the questions changed how far away the object was from the animal . While just this change would have been enough to explore in analyses , we also changed the answer choices . Form A offered three choices in a multiple - choice format while Form B offered four choices in a multi - select format . One of the original intentions of the answer choices was to determine if students could identify that having a block of code before a repeat block is the same ( in this instance ) as having that block of code after the repeat block . However , that intent was lost amongst the changes to Form A . Due to the changes made to this question , comparing results is challenging with our scoring methods , described in Section 3 . 2 . 3 . 1 . 4 IS4 . In IS4 , as seen in Figure 4 , students were asked to order the code blocks to fill in the blanks in the code shown . The envi - ronment illustrations of the problem differed , but the grid size and orientation stayed the same . We altered where the sprite started on the grid , similar to question IS2 , to again explore if one direction ( left or right ) is more difficult for students . There the turtle had to turn right to move on top of the object , whereas the bunny had to turn left . 3 . 1 . 5 IS5 . IS5 was a story - style , multi - select question centered around sequences , as seen in Figure 5 . Both questions asked stu - dents to navigate an animal through a sequence of shapes and colors to reach the goal object . On Form A , this question used a bee navigating through flowers to get to her hive . The bee had to travel from one corner to another , diagonal corner of the grid to reach the hive , while the bird started in the middle of a column and had to travel to a corner to reach the nest . Meanwhile , Form B used a bird navigating through clouds to get to her nest . The grid size also differed between the two forms , with Form B having a smaller grid 5 A Pair of ACES : An Analysis of Isomorphic Questions on an Elementary Computing Assessment ICER 2022 , August 7 – 11 , 2022 , Lugano and Virtual Event , Switzerland Table 2 : Changes made to questions to create the isomorphic versions .

Students were asked to choose the code that would move the animal on top of the object . to navigate through . Although both questions use a multi - select response style , the correct answers are not in the same place . On Form A , the second and fourth answer choices are correct . On Form B , the first , second , and fourth answer choices are correct . 3 . 1 . 6 IS6 . IS6 , as seen in Figure 6 , is similar to IS5 , but adds in a looping notation . Again , the grid size differed between the two forms , resulting in a square grid for Form A and a landscape , rect - angular grid for Form B . The starting and ending positions for the two animals also differed . The bee on Form A started at the top of the grid and need to navigate to the bottom . Meanwhile , the bird on Form B started on the left side of the grid and needed to navigate to the right . It should also , again , be noted that the answer choices on the two forms are not in the same place . The correct answers on Form A are the first , third , and fourth answer choices . On Form B , the second and fourth answer choices are correct . 3 . 2 Scoring Items Since there are different response styles on the assessment , includ - ing multiple - choice and multi - select , we explored different ways of tabulating responses . After comparing scoring approaches , as described in [ 30 ] , we scored the assessment based on each item , where an item may refer to the question or all available answer choices . If the question is a multiple - choice question , there is only one item since there is only one correct answer . If the question is a multi - select question , each answer choice is treated as an item . We scored items this way to ensure fairness in each correct answer choice , as well as to acknowledge that it is correct to not select an incorrect choice . We do not demerit the scores if students select an incorrect answer choice . For example , if a multi - select question has five answer choices , and only three of them are correct answers , a student who selects all possible answer choices in that question will get a total of three out of five possible points : one for each of the correct answers selected , and no points ( and no negative points ) for selecting the wrong answers . 3 . 3 Data Collection and Participant Characteristics In order to pilot all our new isomorphic questions , we constructed two similar assessments ( Form A and B ) that were comprised of five identical questions , six isomorphic questions , and five unique 6 ICER 2022 , August 7 – 11 , 2022 , Lugano and Virtual Event , Switzerland Parker , et al .

In this paper , we only discuss the questions that were identical across the two forms and the isomorphic questions . Across the two forms , we ensured that each assessment had a similar number of questions across each category of constructs and prompt types . After receiving the appropriate Institutional Review Board ap - proval for human subjects research , Forms A and B were given to schools within one school district . Five classes of fourth - grade students , representing five teachers across three schools , took Form A . Five classes of fourth - grade students , representing five teachers across three different schools , took Form B . All students , classes , teachers , and schools received the same curriculum before taking the assessment . Due to the COVID - 19 pandemic , the students par - ticipated in this curriculum virtually over the course of the school year . Demographics for the students that participated can be found in Table 3 . 7 A Pair of ACES : An Analysis of Isomorphic Questions on an Elementary Computing Assessment ICER 2022 , August 7 – 11 , 2022 , Lugano and Virtual Event , Switzerland ( a ) IS4 on Form A ( b ) IS4 on Form B Figure 4 : The two versions of IS4 , representing changes in where the sprite started on the grid and thus the direction blocks used in the answer choices .

For each item , we also calculated difficulty , discrimination , and assessment reliability if that item was dropped . These statistics are provided in Table 4 . We analyzed the identical questions to form a baseline of comparison between our student groups . Finally , we analyzed the isomorphic questions to assess the effects of the changes made in their creation . In Table 4 , in the difficulty column , values are highlighted in green if the difficulty is greater than 0 . 8 , indicating it is an easy question . Similarly , the value is highlighted in red if it is less than 0 . 2 , indicating it is a difficult question . It is not inherently bad for a question to be easy or difficult , but there should be a balance of easy , moderate , and hard questions across the assessment . In the discrim - ination index and point - biserial correlation , values are highlighted in red if they are between - 0 . 2 and 0 . 2 , indicating those items do not strongly correspond with performance on the assessment overall . The Cronbach’s alpha value is calculated for the assessment overall and again for each item to assess if the reliability would increase if that item were dropped . If the alpha value is higher if the item is dropped , the value is highlighted in red .

To compare student performance on these questions , we conducted Pearson’s chi - squared tests of homogeneity with student dichoto - mous performances on items ( either a student answered correctly or they did not ) as our dependent variable . Our chi - square tests and associated significance values can be found in Table 5 . If a chi - square value is significant , that means that student performance on that item is significantly different . The students who took Form A and the students who took Form B performed comparably on all identical questions . After establishing a baseline of comparison among our student participants , we analyzed the student scores on the isomorphic questions . In the same fashion as the identical questions , we con - ducted Pearson’s chi - squared tests of homogeneity with student dichotomous scores on isomorphic questions , which can be found in Table 6 . In the case of IS3 , which had different response styles , we compared student scores only on the similar answer choice . This meant only looking at IS3 - B on Form B , which was a correct answer to IS3 and answered the question in a similar manner as the correct answer on Form A ( which was the third answer choice in Figure 3a ) . IS3 - A was also a correct answer choice on Form B but answered the question in a different manner and thus was less comparable across test forms . Additionally , for IS5 and IS6 , where no answer choices corresponded across the two forms , we transformed the scores on those items to reflect an overall score on the question . Given there were four answer choices for each question , we took the average score across the items and scaled the values to between 0 and 1 . Possible scores on these questions then were a set of [ 0 , 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 75 , 1 ] , which meant we could not use Pearson’s chi - squared tests since we no longer had dichotomous values of 0 and 1 . For IS5 and IS6 , we instead ran Kruskal - Wallis H tests to compare these scaled question scores , which can be seen in Table 6 . 4 RESULTS 4 . 1 Assessment reliability We calculated a Cronbach’s alpha of 0 . 868 for both Form A and Form B . This indicates that each form has a reliability level that falls into the ‘good’ category , between 0 . 8 and 0 . 9 [ 28 ] . These values are an improvement over our previous reliability value , which was below 0 . 7 , and thus our primary goal of growing the number of items to 10 ICER 2022 , August 7 – 11 , 2022 , Lugano and Virtual Event , Switzerland Parker , et al .

There are some items that , if dropped , would increase the reliability of the assessment . These are highlighted in the " Drop 𝛼 " column in Table 4 , such as ID2 on Form A or ID3 - A on both Forms A and B . The items that would result in the biggest changes in reliability tend to correspond with items that performed suboptimally in terms of difficulty , discrimination , and point - biserial correlation values . Each of these items will be examined to determine if they should be included as - is , edited , or removed for future iterations of this assessment . 4 . 2 Item difficulty As seen in the item difficulty and discrimination analysis in Table 4 , there were item - level differences across the two forms . For example , Form A has more items that were “easy " ( i . e . , over 80 % of students answered an item correctly ) but also the some of the most difficult items ( e . g . , IS6 - A with 25 % of students answering it correctly , and IS6 - D with 38 % of students answering it correctly ) . Each item with difficulty and discrimination values outside of our thresholds will continue to be examined and iterated on . 4 . 3 Identical items We included identical questions to provide us with a baseline to compare student performance across the two forms . All identical items had statistically similar scores between Form A and Form B , as seen in Table 5 . This is the expected result , given the students participated in the same curriculum and in the same school dis - trict and their teachers all participated in the same professional development . If scores on any of these items were significantly dif - ferent , that would indicate issues in the fidelity of implementation of our curriculum across our classrooms . However , performance on these questions was similar , which demonstrates that the student populations are similar . 4 . 4 Isomorphic items Due to prior work on isomorphic questions [ 19 , 21 ] , we anticipated that the small changes to create isomorphic questions may result in significant differences in student performance . As seen in Tables 5 and 6 , performance on most of the isomorphic items ( IS1 , IS2 , IS3 , IS4 - C , and an adjusted IS6 ) was significantly different , while only performance on IS4 - A , IS4 - B , and the adjusted IS5 were not signifi - cantly different . We discuss the defining features of the questions in these two groups below . IS4 had the fewest changes – simply changing the direction of the path ( and corresponding answer block ) from right to left . This was the only question on each assessment that had an ordering response style , meaning students had to drag - and - drop answer choice blocks into the correct order . Even though the direction blocks were different , the changes between the isomorphic versions appear minimal enough to produce similar student scores for both versions of the item , though there is still a marginally significant difference in how students responded to the third blank . Student scores were statistically significantly different on IS1 . For IS1 , we changed the grid orientation , giving Form A a landscape grid ( wider than tall ) and Form B a portrait grid ( taller than wide ) , as seen in Figure 1 . We also changed the path on IS1 , where Form A had the turtle start in a corner of the grid and Form B had the bunny start in the center on the bottom row ( see Figure 1 ) . As a result of both of these changes , the correct answer for this multiple - choice question varied slightly across the two forms . Where on Form A the turtle needed to turn right early in the sequence of moves , on Form B the bunny needed to turn right later . Either of these factors might have played a role in student performance , given that IS1 on Form A was easier for students ( 84 . 1 % of students answered it correctly ) than the version of IS1 on Form B ( 56 . 6 % of students answered it correctly ) . IS2 had a different grid size and required different direction blocks across the two forms . On Form A , IS2 had a grid size of 5x4 , where Form B had a grid size of 4x3 , as seen in Figure 2 . IS2 also had the animals start in different spots on the grid , which required them to move in different directions . Due to these changes , the correct answer differed between the two forms . On Form A , the correct answer involved a move block , turning , and another move block . On Form B , the correct answer involved turning , and then 11 A Pair of ACES : An Analysis of Isomorphic Questions on an Elementary Computing Assessment ICER 2022 , August 7 – 11 , 2022 , Lugano and Virtual Event , Switzerland two move blocks . It is possible that having a turn in the middle of a sequence of moves resulted in Form A being more difficult ( 41 . 6 % of students answered it correctly ) than Form B ( 64 . 8 % of students answered it correctly ) . As previously described , IS3 had the most significant changes between the two versions . Thus it is no surprise that the statistical analysis confirmed that student performance on these questions was significantly different . Sixty - one percent of students selected the correct answer on Form A , whereas 43 % selected the similar correct answer on Form B . However , given that Form B included another correct answer , which 56 % of students selected , we can see that students may not see the move block at the end of the repeat block as a correct answer if they are presented with another correct choice ( namely , the move block being before the repeat block ) . However , the steps needed to be taken by the animal in the question also differed . Thus , the changes we made in combination with each other made it hard to directly ascertain what affected student performance on this question . IS5 was a sequence , story - style question . Aside from a change in the environment illustrations from a bee with flowers to a bird with clouds , the only other element that changed was the grid size ( 3x4 for Form A , 3x3 for Form B ) . However , given the path changes , the answer choices were not identical , or even similar , to each other between the two forms , which led us to compile an overall score and compare that across the forms using a Kruskal - Wallis H test ( see Table 6 ) . Overall performance on IS5 was not significantly different across the two forms , despite the changes in environment illustrations and grid size . We analyzed IS6 in a similar way to IS5 . IS6 was a loops and sequences , story - style question that varied in the grid size and the shape of the path , as seen in Figure 6 . On Form A , the animal started at the top of the grid , but on Form B the animal started on the side of the grid . As a result of these changes , the associated IS6 items were significantly more difficult for Form A students ( where the correct answer choices had 25 % , 38 % , and 60 % of students select them ) than the Form B students ( where correct answer choices had 47 % and 59 % of students select them ) . Generally , students could easily identify whether an answer choice was incorrect , though , with 76 - 83 % of students correctly not selecting those choices across the two forms . 5 DISCUSSION Every isomorphic question had a change in the environment illus - trations , changing the animal and objects involved in the question . Given that this was a consistent change , there is no evidence that changing the illustrations resulted in differences in student scores . If this were the case , then every question would have been statistically significantly different . This is similar to the findings from other CS education research [ 16 ] , as well as biology education research [ 43 ] . However , it is worth noting that our illustration changes were very superficial changes to the context and it may be the case that a more substantive change in context would produce differences in student performance . For example , if the isomorphic question asked students to identify the code that would replicate a specific pattern of colors , or if we decontextualized the questions and made them abstract ( e . g . " Choose the code that will produce this output : x x y x x x " ) , it seems likely that students would perform differently . This hypothesis is in line with prior literature in this area [ 20 , 27 ] . All questions had changes in the path shape ( IS2 , IS3 , IS5 , and IS6 ) or direction ( i . e . , IS1 , IS4 ) . The path change to IS4 is a simple reflection while the path change to IS1 is a rotation and a reflection . The path changes could also have affected the total distance the animal had to travel , and thus the number of move blocks needed to correctly answer the question ( IS3 and IS5 ) . The change also could have affected the placement of the turn , changing the number of move blocks needed before and / or after the turn , even if the total path length was not affected ( IS2 ) . IS2 involved a change in the direction the sprite had to move , where the turtle turned to the left while the bunny turned to the right . However , IS4 had a similar change across the two forms but did not have a significant difference in student outcomes . This would indicate that only changing the path direction to move left vs . right does not make a significant difference . Rather , the placement of the turn ( i . e . turning and then moving , as opposed to moving , turning , and then moving again ) might play a role in the difference in student performance . This is similar to a previous hypothesis about spatial memory load potentially causing the outcome differ - ences on isomorphic questions [ 21 ] . Both IS1 and IS6 had changes that ultimately affected the direc - tion the animal had to move across the grid . In both cases , the item where the animal had to move in a left - to - right pattern was less difficult than the item where the animal had to move up and down ( i . e . IS1 involved moving from the bottom of the grid to the top , while IS6 involved the opposite ) . Previous works have explored the relationship between the spatiality of language and spatial rea - soning skills [ 44 ] . All of the students in our study are exposed to English in their classrooms , and 35 % of our students are designated as English Learners , with the predominant home language for those students being Spanish . Both of these languages require students to read left to right . As such , spatial tasks that require movement from left to right may be easier for these students than tasks that move right to left [ 18 , 47 ] , or , in our case , up and down . These changes , and the effects on student performance , merit further investigation in future work . As we mentioned in Section 3 . 1 . 3 , we left IS3 in our analyses , despite the inherent difficulties in doing so . In effect , changing the answer choice type from multiple choice to multi - select and adding another correct answer choice made it challenging to compare the effect of each change made , especially since none of our other isomorphic questions made similar changes . However , the effects of the changes have led to some insight into when a student may identify an answer choice as correct or not in different situations . The correct answer on Form A was selected by a higher percentage of students than the similar correct answer on Form B , but Form B also had another correct answer for students to select . On Form A , students may have felt the option with the move block at the end of the repeat block was the best of the three choices and had to pick it because of the multiple - choice style . But , when presented with another option , with a move block before the repeat block , they are less likely to pick the option with the move block after the repeat block . While we will not be attempting to compare these two versions of IS3 in the future , we will continue to explore students’ 12 ICER 2022 , August 7 – 11 , 2022 , Lugano and Virtual Event , Switzerland Parker , et al . conceptualizations of these two answer choices through cognitive interviews . IS5 and IS6 are both questions that use a grid of colored shapes that an animal must move through to get to the goal object . In the instructions for these questions , students are explicitly told that the animal cannot move diagonally on the grid . However , there are answer choices presented that are only possible if the animal moves diagonally . This admittedly tricks the students into thinking that diagonal moves are possible or into forgetting that these moves are not allowed . In most cases , students easily identify these as incorrect answer choices : 80 - 93 % of students correctly left them blank , except for IS6 - C where only 60 % of students left it blank . However , the inclusion of these answer choices may be testing students’ ability to read and remember directions than their ability to navigate through the grid . Moving forward , we will consider the addition of incorrect answer choices that are incorrect for reasons other than this issue , to further assess the impact of the diagonal movement choices . Taken together , the differences in student performance across the pairs of isomorphs strongly suggest that the specific spatial layout of the question is a radical , as discussed in Section 2 . 2 . This would be consistent with prior work in computing education re - search that draws connections between spatial skills and computer science achievement [ 6 , 26 , 31 , 32 ] . Changing the spatial layout of the questions , which often led to downstream changes to answer choices , led us to create construct isomorphs , which are less likely to perform similarly than item isomorphs [ 23 ] . The fact that student performance on IS5 did not significantly differ , despite changing the radicals of the question , is possibly due to coincidence , more than intentional design . 6 CONCLUSIONS We set out to design and analyze isomorphic questions on an ele - mentary CT assessment to help grow the community knowledge around building reliable assessments . After building isomorphic questions and conducting item - level analyses , we now have two versions of ACES . Each version has a better reliability measure than our original , with all reliability values in a ‘good’ range . With this , we have achieved our goal of growing the number of items in our question bank and improving the reliability of our assessment . Through analyzing the identical questions on the assessments , we were able to form a baseline to compare student performance across the two forms . This allowed us to compare student per - formance on the isomorphic questions with the knowledge that differences are likely due to the questions and not to the student populations . Although further analysis and experimentation are needed , our current data points to illustration changes being in - cidental . Other changes , such as grid size / orientation and path shape / direction , may actually be radical and change an item’s diffi - culty , even though these spatial characteristics are not central to the programming constructs being assessed . Despite the similarly good reliability measures , we can make no claims that these assessments are equivalent or interchangeable , nor did we necessarily intend for them to be . Rather than only changing the context by changing the environment illustrations , we chose to also change other aspects of the item stem and answer choices to experiment with different factors that might affect stu - dent performance . The differences in how isomorphic questions are created can have significant impacts on how students perform on these questions . This is aligned with prior findings of the potential of seemingly small changes leading to wide variability in student performance [ 19 , 21 ] . Isomorphic is not the same as identical , and thus should not be treated as such . Researchers creating assessment items should exercise caution that any changes between assessment forms may result in significant student differences . However , these changes across forms can also lend insight into what features of a question can result in the biggest changes for students . If we know that a question is easier if an animal starts in the corner of a grid , rather than in the center of the bottom row , we can use this to design more equitable assessments that truly assess computa - tional thinking skills , rather than other confounding variables such as spatial skills or cultural background knowledge . We strongly recommend researchers conduct think - aloud interviews with stu - dents to gain greater insight about what knowledge and cognitive processes are being brought to bear when answering assessment questions , particularly if the goal is to use isomorphic items to create psychometrically equivalent test forms . This paper contributes to the research literature terminology and guidelines for the creation of isomorphic assessment items , as well as initial analyses in an elementary CT context . Our findings may not be generalizable to all CT or computing assessments , nor all grade levels of students . More work is needed in this area to ascertain the nuances of isomorphism within different content area and contexts . Future work on ACES includes not only analyzing student per - formance on questions , but also the time and effort students spend on each question , which are known to vary on isomorphic ques - tions even if accuracy does not [ 8 ] . We plan on doing cognitive interviews with the isomorphic questions to better understand the validity of our questions and students’ techniques in answering them . Eventually , we plan on conducting a large - scale psychometric analysis of the assessments to provide appropriate evidence of va - lidity and reliability to the community , allowing for more research teams to use this assessment for their study needs .
