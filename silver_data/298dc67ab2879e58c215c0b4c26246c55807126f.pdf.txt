Extensive in - vitro studies have focused on the thermodynam - ics and kinetics of Fe 3 + binding to a number of transferrins . However , little attention has been given to the thermodynamic characterization of the interaction of transferrin with its receptor . Scope of review : Iron - loaded transferrin ( Tf ) binds with high af ﬁ nity to the speci ﬁ c transferrin receptor ( TfR ) on the cell surface . The Tf – TfR complex is then internalized via receptor mediated endocytosis into an endo - some where iron is released . Here , we provide an overview of recent studies that have used ITC to quantify the interaction of various metal ions with transferrin and highlight our current understanding of the thermo - dynamics of the transferrin – transferrin receptor system at physiological pH . General signi ﬁ cance : The interaction of the iron - loaded transferrin with the transferrin receptor is a key cellular process that occurs during the normal course of iron metabolism . Understanding the thermodynam - ics of this interaction is important for iron homeostasis since the physiological requirement of iron must be appropriately maintained to avoid iron - related diseases . Major conclusions : The thermodynamic data revealed stoichiometric binding of all tested metal ions to trans - ferrin with very high af ﬁ nities ranging between 10 17 and 10 22 M − 1 . Iron - loaded transferrin ( monoferric or diferric ) is shown to bind avidly ( K ~ 10 7 – 10 8 M − 1 ) to the receptor at neutral pH with a stoichiometry of one Tf molecule per TfR monomer . Signi ﬁ cantly , both the N - and the C - lobe contribute to the binding inter - action which is shown to be both enthalpically and entropically driven .

Introduction During the past two decades , a large number of studies were di - rected towards our understanding of the biochemistry and biology of transferrin ( Tf ) and the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , including struc - ture , metal - binding , functional and therapeutic properties , regulation of cellular iron homeostasis and the mechanism of TfR - mediated iron uptake by cells and transport across the blood – brain barrier [ 1 – 4 ] . The serum transferrin system involves the speci ﬁ c recognition of fer - ric Fe 3 + ions alongside a synergistic anion ( usually carbonate ) . At physiological pH , TfR has a high binding af ﬁ nity for iron - loaded Tf whereby iron is released inside the cell following receptor - mediated endocytosis . Upon release of iron , the Tf – TfR complex returns to the cell surface where the apo - transferrin dissociates from the receptor at physiological pH and is released into the circulation for another cycle . The half - life of transferrin in the human circulation is 7 . 6 days , and the lifetime of transferrin - bound Fe is 1 . 7 h . The entire cycle of endocytosis is complete within a few minutes and is estimat - ed to occur 100 – 200 times during the lifetime of the transferrin mol - ecule [ 5 – 7 ] . 2 . The transferrins : a brief historical background — structure and properties The isolation and puri ﬁ cation of the ﬁ rst member of the transfer - rin superfamily from raw egg white , ovotransferrin , was performed by Osborne and Campbell in 1900 [ 8 ] . Almost half a century later , iron - binding proteins from human serum , serum transferrin , and from human milk , lactoferrin , were isolated by a number of laborato - ries [ 9 – 12 ] . Another member of the transferrin superfamily is mela - notransferrin [ 13 ] , a cell - surface glycoprotein found in melanocytes and a number of other tissues . Melanotransferrin ( MTf ) does not ap - pear to play a role in iron metabolism but has an important role in melanoma cell proliferation and tumorigenesis [ 14 ] and is discussed in depth elsewhere ( see Richardson ' s chapter in this special issue ) . There is about 60 % sequence identity between serum transferrin and lactoferrin and about 40 % identity between MTf and other Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1820 ( 2012 ) 318 – 325 ☆ ThisarticleispartofaSpecialIssueentitledTransferrins : Molecularmechanismsof iron transport and disorders . ⁎ Corresponding author .

Transferrin was also found in a number of other body ﬂ uids such as tears and saliva . Their potent anti - in ﬂ ammatory and bacterial activities is mainly due to their extremely high iron binding af ﬁ nity which limits the amount of iron available for microbial growth [ 15 – 21 ] . The reader is urged to refer to Rascon – Cruz ' s chapter in this special issue for additional information on lactoferrin and its functions . Modern transferrins are believed to have evolved by gene fusion and duplication from an ancestral monolobal transferrin with a single metal - binding pocket [ 22 , 23 ] . Two monolobal transferrins were ﬁ rst isolated from the ascidian Pyura stolonifera [ 24 ] and Halocynthia roretzi [ 25 ] . More recently , monolobal transferrin from the plasma of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis , named nicatransferrin ( nicaTf ) was isolated and characterized for its metal - binding capacity [ 26 ] . NicaTf was found to have a high sequence homology to the N - lobe of mod - ern bilobal transferrins with conserved Fe ( III ) - binding residues . How - ever , the signi ﬁ cance of this ﬁ nding in the evolution of the modern family of bilobal transferrin remains unclear [ 27 ] . Modern transfer - rins are a family of homologous monomeric bilobal glycoproteins of molecular weight approximately 80 kDa with a crucial role in iron ho - meostasis . They are composed of a single polypeptide chain of ap - proximately 700 amino acid residues and bind tightly and reversibly two Fe ( III ) ions with the assistance of carbonate ( or bicarbonate ) , the physiological anion , although other synergistic anions have been shown to concomitantly bind [ 2 and references therein ] . The syner - gistic carbonate anion provides two oxygen ligands needed to com - plete the octahedral coordination sphere of the binding site and might play a role in iron release through protonation and disruption of the hydrogen bonding network around the metal ion . Alternatively , the bridging carbonate anion ﬁ rmly locks the metal ion in the binding pocket of the protein thus preventing water from binding and avoid - ing hydrolysis [ 28 ] . The two iron - binding pockets are about 42 Å apart and comprise four highly conserved residues , two tyrosines , one aspartate , one histidine and an arginine residue involved in the anchoring of the carbonate anion to the protein [ 2 , 28 – 31 ] . While transferrin is primarily an iron - binding and transport protein with a very high af ﬁ nity for iron ( in the range of 10 21 – 10 22 M − 1 ) , it is only about 30 % saturated with iron in normal human serum . A number of metal ions ( up to40different metalions ) havebeen shownto bindto transferrin [ 3 , 4 , 32 – 38 ] in the presence of different synergistic anions such as bicarbonate , oxalate or nitrilotriacetate and include Mn ( II ) , Cu ( II ) , Ni ( II ) , Cd ( II ) , VO ( II ) , Zn ( II ) , Cr ( III ) , Co ( III ) , Ru ( III ) , Bi ( III ) , Ga ( III ) , In ( III ) , Al ( III ) , Tl ( III ) , La ( III ) , Ce ( III ) , UO 2 ( II ) , Nd ( III ) , Sm ( III ) and Gd ( III ) . While some of these metal ions are toxic , with perhaps no physiological signi ﬁ cance or bene ﬁ ts , such binding may play an impor - tant role in the transport and delivery of metal - containing compounds for diagnosis and therapy particularly that hetero - metal transferrin complexes are still recognized by the transferrin receptor . For example , platinum complexes are currently being used in cancer chemotherapy , gold compounds are employed in the treatment of arthritis , gallium , in - dium and aluminum are used as medical diagnostic radioisotopes , and bismuth , ruthenium and titanium are used as anti - ulcer medication [ 2 , 39 and references therein ] . 2 . 1 . The transferrin receptors — TfRs Two transferrin receptors have been described , TfR1 and TfR2 with TfR1 being the more extensively characterized . Both of them are homodimeric type II cell transmembrane glycoprotein receptors that only bind iron - loaded transferrin whereby the diferric form ex - hibits higher af ﬁ nity to the receptor than either monoferric forms ( C - loaded or N - loaded transferrin ) at neutral pH [ 2 , 28 ] . TfR1 is a di - sul ﬁ de bonded dimer consisting of two identical monomers with mo - lecular mass ~ 95 kDa each . The large extracellular ectodomain portion has a molecular mass of approximately 70 kDa and contains the transferrin molecule binding site . The two receptors share about 45 % amino acid sequence identity and about 65 % similarities in their extracellular domains . The af ﬁ nity of TfR1 for diferric transferrin is considerably higher than that of TfR2 with the dissociation constants for the two receptors , in their soluble forms being approximately 1 nM and 30 nM for TfR1 and TfR2 , respectively [ 40 ] . Knock - out stud - ies of TfR2 in mice showed that TfR2 is required for normal systemic homeostasis and does not compensate for TfR1 knock - out mutation [ 41 – 44 ] . A more detailed description of the transferrin superfamily members , their associated receptors and interacting partners and the regulation of iron homeostasis by transferrin receptor 2 ( TfR2 ) is provided elsewhere in this volume ( see the chapters by “ Chen and Enns ” , “ Lambert ” , and “ Geiser and Winzerling ” ) . Indirect methods , such as ELISA and Surface Plasmon Resonance ( SPR ) have been routinely used in the characterization of molecular interactions . Other methods ( e . g . dialysis , ultracentrifugation ) rely on the direct determination of the different species present in the sys - tem ( free macromolecule , free ligand and macromolecule / ligand complex ) while spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques measure a signal that is proportional to the advance of the reaction ( formation of macromolecule / ligand complex ) . When using spectroscopic tech - niques several experiments at different temperatures must be per - formed in order to estimate the binding enthalpy from the temperature dependence of the association constant ( e . g . Van ' t Hoff equation ) . Isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) has evolved as a valuable tool to characterize binding interactions and the molecular forces that drive them . It is thus considered the preferred technique in many ﬁ elds of science due to a number of practical reasons such as accuracy , time required to run an experiment and amount of sample needed . Furthermore , ITC is a true in - solution method that requires no chemical tagging or immobilization of binding com - ponents and offers the advantage of working with either colored so - lutions , turbid or particulate suspensions . When combined with structural information , the elucidation of the nature and magnitude of the forces that are responsible for molecular interactions is an im - portant step towards the understanding of the physical basis of mac - romolecular recognition and cellular mechanisms . This chapter provides an overview of our current understanding of the molecular interaction of Tf with TfR as characterized by microcalorimetry . In particular , it addresses the thermodynamics of binding of various metals to transferrin and the interaction of Tf and a number of mu - tants with TfR . 3 . Isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) ITC is an emerging and powerful technique that is widely used to obtain in - solution biophysical data and evaluate the thermodynamic quantities involved in biochemical reactions or association equilibria . While the theoretical background and other practical aspects of ITC are discussed in detail elsewhere [ 45 – 51 ] , a brief description of the technique and experimental design will be provided here . Notwith - standing limitations , ITC is considered the gold standard for measur - ing biomolecular interactions . Modern titration nano - calorimeters are able to accurately measure very small amounts of heat change ( b 0 . 2 μ J ) in aqueous solution upon the delivery of a ligand . In a single experiment , ITC measures the association constant ( K ) , stoichiometry ( n ) and the enthalpy change ( Δ H 0 ) of binding . Because K is related to the Gibbs free energy of binding ( Δ G 0 ) , the entropy change of the re - action can thus be easily calculated from the relationship Δ G 0 = − RT ln K = Δ H 0 − T Δ S 0 . Most of the commonly used isothermal titra - tion calorimeters are based on a cell feedback network which mea - sures the differential heat effects between a sample and a reference cell . This is known as differential power compensation and is due to a very small temperature difference between the two cells and is the baseline level in the absence of any reaction . When a reaction oc - curs , a temperature change is observed between the sample and the reference cell and is detected by the calorimeter . Thus , exothermic 319 F . Bou - Abdallah , T . R . Terpstra / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1820 ( 2012 ) 318 – 325 reactions trigger a temporary decrease in the feedback power while endothermic reactions trigger an increased feedback . The heat evolved or absorbed by the reaction is then obtained by integration of these de ﬂ ections from baseline , with respect to time . In a typical ITC experiment , the macromolecule is placed in the sample cell while the reference cell contains buffer or water minus the macromolecule . The heat absorbed or evolved during a calorimet - ric titration is directly proportional to the fraction of bound ligand . For the initial injections , all or most of the added ligand is bound to the macromolecule , resulting in large endothermic or exothermic sig - nals , depending on the nature of the association . As the ligand con - centration increases , the macromolecule becomes saturated and subsequently less heat is evolved or absorbed on further addition of titrant . A binding curve is then obtained from a plot of the heats from each injection against the ratio of ligand to binding partner in the ITC reaction cell . Analysis of this binding curve using the appro - priate binding model will lead to the determination of all thermody - namic parameters . It is important to note that the range of binding af ﬁ nities that could be measured by modern ITC instruments is nor - mally between 10 3 and 10 9 M − 1 and that the observed heat usually contains heat effects from several sources and side reactions and these include heat of binding ( to be measured ) , heat of dilution of li - gand , heat of mixing , heat of protein conformational changes upon li - gand binding , heat of protonation or deprotonation of reactants or products , heat of metal - ion - buffer complexation , etc . Because it is not trivial to isolate the heat from these different sources , often the heat obtained by ITC is the net heat of reaction which includes contri - butions from all reactions involved in the binding process . Conse - quently , the ITC experimental conditions will dictate the extent of variability of thermodynamic quantities depending on the nature and effect of the side reactions . Nevertheless , control experiments in the absence of the macromolecule are typically performed to correct for some of the unwanted heat effects particularly those due to both dilution and mixing . Despite the importance of ITC and its ease of use , the correlation between thermodynamic parameters and molecular structural fea - tures is somewhat under - valued . Nevertheless , a lot of attention has been diverted to ITC and its application to many diverse ﬁ elds ranging from biological problems to optimization of lead compounds and pharmaceutical development and nanotechnology [ 52 – 61 ] . For ex - ample , dissection of binding af ﬁ nity into the separate enthalpic and entropic contributions provides valuable information with regard to the binding mode of a ligand or how a potential drug interacts with the target , which can be used to build structure – activity relationships and computer - aided drug design . In terms of biological application , a number of ITC studies characterizing the thermodynamics of different metal ions binding to ferritin have appeared in recent years [ 52 – 55 ] . In a recent review [ 56 ] , Wilcox highlighted a number of studies that employed ITC to look at various metal ions binding to proteins . The review provided new insights into the thermodynamics of metal – protein interactions beyond the simple determination of binding stoi - chiometry and af ﬁ nity constants and showed the importance of quan - tifying enthalpic and entropic contributions in trying to understand the meaning of thermodynamic changes leading to metal – protein complex stability . It is important to note that while the observed thermodynamic pa - rameters ( e . g . Δ G 0 , Δ H 0 and Δ S 0 ) represent the change in state of the system , it is not always easy to understand or unambiguously inter - pret their meaning , particularly in the case of complex systems with multiple binding sites , cooperativity , etc . Nevertheless , it is of interest to brie ﬂ y mention what these parameters generally describe . The Gibbs free energy change , Δ G 0 , which is derived from the association constant K , indicates the binding af ﬁ nity or strength of the interac - tion . The enthalpy of binding Δ H 0 re ﬂ ects the interaction of the bind - ing macromolecules relative to the individual macromolecules with the solvent . These contributions are primarily due to hydrogen bond formation , electrostatic and van der Waals interactions . The entropy of binding Δ S 0 is the harder to understand conceptually but it re ﬂ ects a change in the degree of order of the system . In many cases , large and positive entropy values are often due to the changes in the hydra - tion of the protein and of the ligands upon binding . Entropy changes are also in ﬂ uenced by changes in conformation of the macromole - cules ( e . g . folding / unfolding ) and the restriction of degrees of free - dom of the macromolecules main chain and side groups [ 56 – 61 ] . 4 . Thermodynamic characterization of iron binding to transferrin 4 . 1 . Ovotransferrin and serum transferrin Almost two decades ago , Brandtsand coworkers employed sensitive isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate the binding of ferric ion to the N - site and C - site of ovotransferrin ( oTf ) and human serum trans - ferrin ( hTf ) under various experimental conditions [ 62 , 63 ] . These in - clude different protein concentrations , double - and single - domain transferrin ( full length N - site and C - site molecules and only N - site and C - site terminal half - molecules ) , thepresence or absence of the syn - ergistic carbonate anion , and variations in pH , buffer and temperature . The proteins were titrated with an iron solution added in the form of an iron – nitrilotriacetic acid complex ( Fe – NTA ) where NTA was present in a two - fold molar excess . The two studies showed that the thermody - namics and kinetics of the binding events were quite different for the two sites of the two proteins . The data indicate that the two Table 1 Titration calorimetry data for the binding of Fe - NTA to ovotransferrin ( oTf ) and human serum transferrin ( hTf ) in the presence ( 25 mM ) and absence of bicarbonate in 100 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 and 27 °C .

Bou - Abdallah , T . R . Terpstra / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1820 ( 2012 ) 318 – 325 binding sites in these proteins , which are separated by some 40 Å , are not independent of one another but communicate as a result of ligand - dependent changes in the heats and free energies of domain – domain interactions . For example , the preferential binding of bicarbon - ate and iron to the N - site over the C - site of ovotransferrin is due to the faster rate of bicarbonate insertion and higher binding constant , respec - tively , while it is the exact opposite with serum transferrin . Table 1 summarizes the bicarbonate and iron - binding events in both proteins as observed by ITC . 4 . 2 . Melanotransferrin Melanotransferrin ( MTf ) , also called p97 , is a 97 - kDa protein and a member of the transferrin superfamily . It shares about 38 % sequence homology with human transferrin , human lactoferrin , and ovotrans - ferrin [ 64 , 65 ] . However , unlike human transferrin , MTf is a mem - brane - bound transferrin and does not seem to ef ﬁ ciently donate iron to cells [ 13 , 66 – 69 ] . While the iron - binding ligands in the N - lobe of MTf and hTf are identical and able to bind Fe [ 70 , 71 ] , several critical amino acid substitutions render the C - lobe of MTf incapable of binding iron [ 72 ] . A recent study employing MTf knockout mice showed no differences with wild type mice suggesting no essential role for MTf in iron metabolism [ 73 ] . An earlier study suggested the existence of another MTf gene which encodes a soluble form of the protein that can be found in the serum of patients with various dis - ease states , including Alzheimer ' s disease [ 74 ] . However , the role of this soluble MTf protein is not clear but it is suspected to be impli - cated in the biological role of MTf [ 75 ] . The binding af ﬁ nity of iron to MTf was studied by ITC and DSC ( Differential Scanning Calorimetry ) and was found to be similar to other known transferrins ( i . e . K ITC = 2 . 6×10 7 M − 1 and Δ H = − 35 . 95 kJ / mol in the absence of carbonate , 100 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 25 °C ( Table 2 ) and K DSC = 4 . 4×10 17 M − 1 , under the same conditions but in the presence of 25 mM bicarbonate ) [ 76 ] . Consistent with the amino acid sequence alignment [ 72 ] , both ITC and DSC data revealed only one iron - binding site in the N - lobe of the molecule [ 76 ] . The au - thors argue that MTf might provide another mechanism for iron de - livery to cells in case Tf is absent from the medium . Their argument is based on the apparent high af ﬁ nity constant of iron for MTf ( ~ 10 17 M − 1 ) and the fact that mammalian cells in culture may ex - press ~ 10 6 molecules of MTf / cell [ 76 , 77 ] . Using mixed glial cultures from hypotransferrinemic mice [ 78 ] , which lack Tf , the authors sug - gest that another dynamic metal exchange system ( other than Tf – TfR ) was responsible for the non - Tf - bound iron uptake into the tis - sues [ 78 , 79 ] . Interestingly , receptor - bound diferric transferrin re - leases its iron preferentially from the C - lobe at low pH [ 80 ] which probably explains why circulating transferrin has its N - lobe “ always ” loaded with iron . It was thus proposed that a major role of the N - lobe in transferrin is to facilitate iron release from the C - lobe [ 81 , 82 ] . How - ever , in the case of MTf where iron is only found in the N - lobe , the protein might provide a back - up mechanism for iron delivery to cells in the absence of a Tf – TfR system . Interestingly , in an earlier study on the release of iron from the two iron - binding sites of trans - ferrin by human erythroleukemia ( K562 ) cells , the N - terminal site of transferrin was found to lose its iron before the C - terminal site at a higher pH induced by exposing the cells to increasing concentrations of the weak base methylamine [ 83 ] . 5 . Isothermal titration calorimetry studies of titanium and vanadium binding to hTf As mentioned earlier , apo - human serum transferrin is known to bind a wide variety of metal ions . The strength of binding appears to be determined by the acidity of the metal ion [ 84 – 86 ] and the li - gand donor [ 87 ] rather than the size of the ion . The kinetics of metal ions ( i . e . aluminum , gallium , bismuth , uranyl and cobalt ) up - take and release by transferrin upon interaction with its receptor is covered by El Hage Chahine in a separate chapter of this special issue . Nonetheless , recent studies employing isothermal titration cal - orimetry have looked into the binding of metal ions ( other than iron ) , particularly titanium , Ti ( IV ) and vanadium species , to transferrin ( more below ) . A more recent study investigated the binding of trans - ferrin to ruthenium complexes which have been shown to be active against resistant malaria and several lines of cancer cells [ 88 ] . The ITC data showed several binding sites on the apo - protein with bind - ing af ﬁ nities in the range of 10 3 to 10 5 M − 1 depending on the type of Ru - complex used . 5 . 1 . Titanium binding to hTf In the presence of ≥ 3 equivalents of citrate , the { Ti ( cit ) 3 } 3 – was found to be the predominant species in the pH range of 6 to 9 [ 89 ] and a stable complex that would rapidly deliver Ti ( IV ) to Tf [ 90 ] . As with the case of iron binding to Tf , the binding stoichiometry was found to be one Ti ( IV ) per site , with the N - and C - lobe exhibiting differ - ent binding af ﬁ nities ( i . e . one order of magnitude higher af ﬁ nity to the C - site than the N - site ) [ 90 ] . The ITC af ﬁ nity constants and change in enthalpy in the absence of bicarbonate were determined to be K C = 3 . 2 10 6 M − 1 , Δ H = − 8 . 03 kJ / mol and K N = 2 . 4×10 5 M − 1 , Δ H = − 4 . 89 kJ / mol for the C - lobe and the N - lobe , respectively ( Table 2 ) . When accounting for the stability constant of { Ti ( cit ) 3 } 3 − , the pH and the bicarbonate concentration , the thermodynamic stability constants for Ti ( IV ) binding to the two lobes of Tf were calculated to be log K C = 26 . 8fortheC - lobeandlogK N = 25 . 7fortheN - lobe [ 90 ] suggesting Table 2 Thermodynamic parameters of metal ions binding to transferrins , pH 7 . 4 – 7 . 5 and 25 – 27 °C .

Vanadium binding to hTf A series of ITC and DSC experiments using different vanadium sources , such as vanadyl sulfate ( VOSO 4 ) , Bis ( maltolato ) oxovanadiu - m ( IV ) ( BMOV ) and sodiummetavanadate ( NaVO 3 ) , wereusedtodeter - mine the thermodynamic parameters of vanadium binding to the C - lobe and N - lobe of apo - hTf [ 92 ] . The results are summarized in Table 2 . Brie ﬂ y , it was found that the calorimetric traces for the three vanadium ions obtained from BMOV , VOSO 4 or NaVO 3 are similar to each other and that apo - Tf binds indistinguishably two equivalents of vanadyl / vanadate ions atthe N - and C - sites . Vanadyl ions are suggested to readily oxidize to vanadate ions where the average association con - stant of vanadate binding to hTf is K ITC ~ 10 5 M − 1 ( Table 2 ) , a result consistent with earlier measurements of vanadate ions binding to transferrin [ 93 ] . 6 . Isothermal titration calorimetry studies of transferrin binding to the transferrin receptor Extensive studies have focused on the thermodynamics and ki - netics of Fe 3 + binding to a number of transferrins . However , little attention has been given to the thermodynamic characterization of the interaction of transferrin with its receptor . A 7 . 5 Å cryo - EM model of the hTf / TfR complex has provided the ﬁ rst approximation of the regions contributing to the high binding af ﬁ nity of hTf to the TfR [ 81 ] . Extensive mutagenesis work on the human TfR by the Bjorkman lab [ 94 ] in combination with radiolytic footprinting studies [ 95 , 96 ] validated some parts of the cryo - EM model and highlighted other areas of possible interest . The data suggested that the main contact with the helical region of the TfR is through the C1 sub - domain . Other studies [ 97 , 98 ] have shown that the iso - lated N - lobe does not bind to the TfR and / or donate iron to cells and thus are in contrast with the hTf / TfR cryo - EM model . On the other hand , the binding of the human C - lobe alone to TfR has a dis - sociation constant K D of ~ 650 nM in cell binding experiments [ 99 ] and a K D of ~ 800 nM in SPR experiments [ 81 ] . This binding is ~ 650 – 800 fold weaker in comparison to the diferric hTf which has a K D of ~ 1 nM . The implication of this data is that the presence of the two lobes is critical for high receptor af ﬁ nity . In order to validate or refute some of these results , ITC measurements with a number of transferrin samples were performed . 6 . 1 . ITC of full - length Diferric ( Fe 2 hTf ) and Monoferric ( Fe N hTf and Fe C hTf ) transferrin interaction with TfR At pH 7 . 5 , apotransferrin does not have any measurable af ﬁ nity for the transferrin receptor as determined by ITC ( Bou - Abdallah et al . , unpublished data ) . The heat generated from this binding interaction is similar to that of the background heat due to dilution . This result might be expected since the apoprotein does not contain any iron to deliver . On the other hand , iron - containing transferrin ( whether monoferric or diferric ) is predicted to interact strongly with the receptor . Fig . 1 shows the raw calorimetric data and the total heat generated upon the interaction of diferric and monoferric transferrins with the transferrin receptor at pH 7 . 5 [ 100 ] . Since the transferrin re - ceptor exists as a dimer in solution , the integrated heats ( Fig . 1 insets ) were plotted as a function of the molar ratio of hTf to TfR monomer , thus the stoichiometry of one Tf per one TfR monomer . The strong binding af ﬁ nities ( K ~ 10 7 – 10 8 M − 1 ) between the three transferrin samples and the transferrin receptor were achieved by both favor - able enthalpy and entropy changes ( Δ H 0 ~ − 17 to − 33 kJ / mol and Δ S 0 ~ 50 – 85 J / mol . K ) . The large and positive entropy values are most likely due to the change in the hydration of the two proteins upon binding . It is interesting to note that the af ﬁ nity of the diferric protein for the transferrin receptor is about 10 - fold higher than either of the monoferric transferrins , and the enthalpy of binding is twice as high re ﬂ ecting contributions from each lobe of transfer - rin . Similar af ﬁ nity values were reported in an earlier study using rabbit reticulocytes [ 101 ] . The stronger binding af ﬁ nity and favor - able change in enthalpy are , however , compensated by an entropic penalty [ 100 ] .

Terpstra / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1820 ( 2012 ) 318 – 325 correlation spectroscopy reported comparable af ﬁ nity values [ 33 , 102 ] . 6 . 2 . ITC of Diferric ( Fe 2 hTf ) N - lobe mutants interaction with TfR Several amino acid residues in the N - lobe of human transferrin ( N1 and N2 sub - domains ) were identi ﬁ ed in the “ cryo - EM model ” [ 80 ] and “ epitope mapping studies ” [ 103 ] and were proposed to in - teract with the helical region of the TfR . In order to elucidate which of these residues was crucial to Tf – TfR recognition , several single point N - lobe mutants ( P142A , R143A , K144A and P145A ) in a diferric Tf background were titrated against the transferrin receptor . The ITC results are presented in Fig . 2 [ 100 ] . The ITC data corroborated the prediction from the cryo - EM model and showed that only three of the four residues ( P142 , K144 and P145 ) appear to be involved in the interaction with the TfR . These results con ﬁ rm earlier work [ 97 – 100 , 103 , 104 ] implicating the N - lobe in this interaction . Thus , at neutral pH , it appears that both lobes are required for the strong bind - ing af ﬁ nity of the diferric Tf to TfR [ 100 ] . More recent ITC measurements of different iron - free and iron - containing transferrin samples using a Nano ITC low volume calorim - eter from TA Instruments showed somewhat lower binding af ﬁ nities but similar heats of reactions ( Bou - Abdallah et al . , unpublished data ) . While the data in reference [ 100 ] was collected on an older ITC instrument ( a CSC Model 4200 isothermal titration calorimeter from Calorimetry Science Corporation ) , the exact reason ( s ) for the lower binding af ﬁ nities are currently unknown . Nonetheless , the data from either instrument exhibit a similar overall trend whereby monoferric C - lobe or N - lobe transferrins consistently show lower binding af ﬁ nity to the receptor in comparison to diferric transferrin . It is noteworthy that the Nano ITC low volume instrument uses much less sample than the CSC model ( 5 to 6 times less protein , i . e . 0 . 4 – 0 . 5 mg Tf and TfR is required per ITC experiment on the Nano ITC vs 2 – 3 mg for the CSC model ) . Thus , while the CSC experiments are impacted by large amounts of Tf and TfR , the Nano ITC has the dual bene ﬁ t of using less protein while avoiding solubility issues at higher protein concentrations . 6 . 3 . ITC of transferrin binding to the transferrin receptor from Neisseria meningitidis A recent investigation of the binding of human transferrin to the transferrin receptor of Neisseria meningitidis was carried out using mi - crocalorimetry [ 105 ] . The N . meningitidis receptor consists of two types of subunits , a transmembrane protein , TbpA , proposed to serve as a channel for the transport of iron across the outer - membrane - anchored protein , TbpB , which interacts with TbpA and is itself com - posed of two different isotypes , TbpB I and TbpB II [ 105 ] . The two types of receptorproteins areknown to bind hTfbut con ﬂ ictingresults regarding the af ﬁ nity , modes of binding , role and contribution of each protein subunit to hTf binding , and consequently iron uptake , have emerged [ 105 and references therein ] . The ITC data cleared much of this controversy and allowed a detailed characterization and clear as - sessment of the thermodynamics of this interaction . In brief , the data revealed three different and independent binding sites for holo - hTf on the full receptor ( TbpA / TbpB ) whereby TbpA contained the high 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 - 40 - 30 - 20 - 10 0 J TF / sTFR monomer J / sec A 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 - 30 - 20 - 10 0 J TF / sTFR monomer B 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 - 30 - 20 - 10 0 J TF / sTFR monomer J / sec J / sec J / sec C 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 D 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 - 30 - 20 - 10 0 J TF / sTFR monomer Time ( sec ) Time ( sec ) Time ( sec ) Time ( sec ) Fig . 2 .

The binding of hTf to the isolated subunits ( TbpA and TbpB ) was also demonstrated where - by TbpA exhibited a strong preference for apo - hTf ( 20 times higher af - ﬁ nity than holo - hTf ) whereas TbpB had a preferential af ﬁ nity to holo - hTf . Overall , the ITC data provided new insights into the structure and function of the transferrin receptor from Neisseria meningitidis and showed that TbpB controls the binding speci ﬁ city of TbpA towards hTf by increasing the local concentration of holo - hTf thus affecting the iron uptake capacity of the receptor [ 105 ] . 7 . Conclusions and future studies The use of ITC in characterizing biomolecular interactions has been steadily increasing since the development of a new generation of sensitive calorimetry instruments [ 59 , 61 ] . Despite the existence of some limitations ( i . e . restricted range of binding af ﬁ nities , low heat of binding reaction and solubility ) , the ability to perform a sim - ple titration and collect a full set of thermodynamic parameters is a major advantage of this direct and true in - solution method . Thermo - dynamic data provide extremely useful information on the energetic forces that drive a biomolecular interaction but the challenge remains in being able to properly analyze thermodynamic results and identify links between structure and function . Here , we have reviewed impor - tant ITC data on the interaction of metal ions with transferrin and outlined the thermodynamics of the transferrin – transferrin receptor system at physiological pH . As mentioned earlier , the iron loaded transferrin delivers its content of iron by receptor - mediated endocy - tosis after attaching to the transferrin receptor at the cell membrane . At the acidic pH of the endosome , the apo - protein remains attached to its receptor before it is returned back to the cell surface for another cycle . Thus , future ITC experiments must be performed to elucidate the thermodynamics of this interaction at the acidic pH of the endo - some and subsequently evaluate the contributions of speci ﬁ c amino acid residues on both proteins and their role in iron delivery to cells .
