© 2006 Nature Publishing Group GTP - dependent twisting of dynamin implicates constriction and tension in membrane ﬁssion Aure´lien Roux 1 , Katherine Uyhazi 1 , Adam Frost 2 & Pietro De Camilli 1 Dynamin , a crucial factor in endocytosis 1 – 3 , is a member of a family of GTPases that participates in membrane ﬁssion 4 – 6 . It was initially proposed to act as a machine that constricts and cuts the neck of nascent vesicles in a GTP - hydrolysis - dependent reaction 4 , 5 , but subsequent studies suggested alternative models 2 , 7 , 8 . Here we monitored the effect of nucleotides on dynamin - coated lipid tubules in real time . Addition of GTP , but not of GDP or GTP - g S , resulted in twisting of the tubules and supercoiling , suggesting a rotatory movement of the helix turns relative to each other during GTP hydrolysis . Rotation was conﬁrmed by the movement of beads attached to the tubules . Twisting activity produced a longitudinal tension that was released by tubule breakage when both ends of the tubule were anchored . Fission also occurred when dynamin and GTP were added to lipid tubules that had been generated from liposomes by the motor activity of kinesin on microtubules . No ﬁssion events were observed in the absence of longitudinal tension . These ﬁndings demonstrate a mechano - enzyme activity of dynamin in endocytosis , but also imply that constriction is not sufﬁcient for ﬁssion . At the short necks of endocytic vesicles , other factors 6 , 9 , 10 leading to tension may cooperate with the constricting activity of dynamin to induce ﬁssion 11 – 13 . Puriﬁed dynamin has been shown , by negative - staining electron microscopy ( EM ) , to tubulate lipid membranes and to fragment them into small vesicles on GTP hydrolysis 14 – 16 . However , when the products of these incubations were frozen in suspension and analysed by cryo - EM , GTP - dependent constriction—but not ﬁssion—was observed 17 . It was proposed that tubule fragmentation observed in other assays might be the result of mechanical stress of the con - stricted tubules during sample preparation 17 . EM methods rely on static observations . To overcome this problem , we developed light - microscopy - based assays to monitor dynamically the effect of dynamin on lipid membranes . We ﬁrst adapted a published method for the analysis of polymer - dependent membrane deformation 18 . A drop of lipids is deposited and dried on a coverslip , which is then mounted on a glass slide to create a microchamber . Addition of aqueous buffers produces a reorganization of the lipids into stacks of ﬂat membrane bilayers that were used as templates for membrane tubulation 11 . A brain polar lipids ( BPL ) fraction or a synthetic lipids mixture ( SLM ) mimicking BPL ( see Methods ) , both supplemented with 5 % mol . / mol . phos - phatidyl - inositol - 4 , 5 - biphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) , were used . Injec - tion of puriﬁed brain dynamin ( 0 . 4 – 1 mg ml 2 1 , no nucleotides ) into the chamber induced the growth of narrow tubules , either at the edges or on the top of the most superﬁcial layer of the lipid sheets , which could be observed by differential interference contrast ( DIC ) microscopy ( Fig . 1a , c ; Supplementary Movie S1 ) . Tubulation required the presence of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( compare Fig . 1a with Fig . 1b , and see Supplementary Fig . S1 ) , consistent with the property of dynamin to bind this phosphoinositide 8 . Tubules grew at the rate of approximately 5 – 7 m m min 2 1 ( Fig . 1c ) , and up to tens of micrometres in length ( Fig . 1a ) , eventually forming an apparent network ( Fig . 1d ) . Fluorescence experiments with lipids doped with rhodamine - labelled phosphatidylethanolamine ( Rhod – PE ) and with Alexa - 488 – dynamin conﬁrmed that the linear structures visible by DIC microscopy were dynamin - coated membrane tubules ( Fig . 1d ) . Sequential injection of Alexa - 488 – dynamin followed by unlabelled dynamin revealed a lackof random intermixing within the coat .

Vol 441 | 25 May 2006 | doi : 10 . 1038 / nature04718 528 © 2006 Nature Publishing Group ﬂuorescent dynamin was found at the tubule tips , suggesting that tubules grew from their base ( Fig . 1e ) . However , ﬂuorescent tubule segments intercalated by unlabelled segments were also seen ( Fig . 1e ) , possibly reﬂecting polymerization of unlabelled dynamin from points of discontinuity within the dynamin coat . Addition of 1 mM GTP produced dramatic changes of the net - work . First , most tubules became straight ( within seconds ) , suggesting contraction and longitudinal stretching between nodes of the network . Second , they broke and collapsed , leading ( within 10 – 20 seconds ) to isolated clusters of membranes ( Fig . 2a ; Sup - plementary Movie S2 ) . GDP caused only a light contraction of the tubules ( data not shown ) , but not ﬁssion ( Supplementary Fig . S2a ) . GTP - g S did not produce either contraction or ﬁssion , but stimulated the growth of new tubules ( Supplementary Fig . S2a ) . Experiments with ﬂuorescent dynamin and lipids yielded the same results , demonstrating that tubule disruption by GTP is not the result of dynamin dissociation from the lipids ( Supplementary Fig . S2b ) . The behaviour of 93 individual tubules following GTP addition was examined . Contraction with an increase in longitudinal tension , as indicated by the acquisition of a rectilinear course ( Fig . 2a , b ) , generally correlated with the appearance of densities along the tubule ( red arrowheads in Fig . 2b ; see below ) and ended with a single break , followed by the retraction of the two stumps ( Fig . 2b and Sup - plementary Fig . S2c ; Supplementary Movie S3 ) . All tubules with a free ( non - anchored ) end retracted without breakage ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . S2d ; Supplementary Movie S4 ) . Thus , the reported GTP - dependent constricting activity of dynamin 14 , 17 is insufﬁcient to achieve ﬁssion and , at least under these in vitro conditions , longitudinal tension must come into play . One could expect that , if dynamin - coated tubules were anchored at multiple sites along their length , multiple ﬁssion events would occur . Such tubules were generated by depositing giant liposomes doped with Rhod – PE and precoated with kinesin on a network of microtubules in the presence of ATP 19 , 20 ( Fig . 3a , left panel ) , and then adding dynamin ( or Alexa - 488 – dynamin ) , in the absence of nucleo - tides , to the tubules pulled by kinesin . Dynamin did associate with these lipid tubules , which were bound to microtubules by multiple kinesins 20 , and modiﬁed their appearance , but did not break them . On the basis of the overlapping ﬂuorescence of Alexa 488 and rhodamine , the tubules seemed to become thinner , with correspond - ing focal swellings ( Fig . 3a , middle panels ) , in agreement with the smaller diameters of dynamin - coated tubules ( approximately 20 nm , inner diameter 21 ) relative to kinesin - pulled tubules ( in the range of 40 nm or more 19 ) . Dynamin also bound to microtubules , consistent with its microtubule - binding properties 22 ( Fig . 3a , middle panels ) . On further addition of GTP , dynamin - coated lipid tubules ( Fig . 3a , right panels , and Fig . 3b ; Supplementary Movie S5 and Supplemen - tary Fig . S3 ) , but not naked tubules ( data not shown ) , underwent rapid fragmentation . Most fragments remained anchored to the tubules , although some of them ﬂoated away into the medium , possibly reﬂecting the reversibility of kinesin – microtubule anchoring sites ( Fig . 3b , red arrowheads ; Supplementary Movie S5 ) . Accord - ingly , such dispersion was stronger in the continued presence of ATP ( data not shown ) . Dynamin , as expected 23 , dissociated from micro - tubules in the presence of GTP , although it remained associated with the lipid fragments ( Fig . 3a , middle and right panels ) .

NATURE | Vol 441 | 25 May 2006 LETTERS 529 © 2006 Nature Publishing Group of tubule ) was ten times higher than along the tubules formed by dynamin on membrane sheets ( Supplementary Fig . S3b ) , conﬁrming that when tubules have multiple anchoring sites the activity of dynamin produces multiple ﬁssion events . Rapid tubule fragmenta - tion , as well as dispersion of the fragments in the medium ( more prominent in the presence of ATP ; see above ) , was also observed when dynamin and GTP were added together ( Fig . 3c and Sup - plementary Movie S6 ) , indicating that dynamin - mediated frag - mentation occurs very efﬁciently on preformed tubules that are already under tension—as they are expected to be under these conditions 20 . In tubules generated by dynamin on membrane sheets ( Fig . 2 ) , the tension required for ﬁssion may be generated by a GTP - hydrolysis - dependent longitudinal contraction of the dynamin coat . In fact , previous cryo - EM analysis 17 , 21 , 24 of dynamin - coated tubules revealed that constriction also results in a reduction of the helical pitch ( from 13 nm to 9 nm ; ref . 17 ) , thus producing a shortening , by approxi - mately 30 % , of the dynamin helix . This structural rearrangement of the coat is not sufﬁcient to account for the retraction observed for free tubules in the membrane sheets assay ( Fig . 2c ) . A potential explanation for such a dramatic shortening came from further observation of tubule dynamics on GTP addition . In several cases , coated tubules formed loops ( Fig . 4a ; Supplementary Movie S7 ) , which , after GTP addition , underwent twisting to form supercoils ( plectonemes ; red arrowheads in Fig . 4a ) , suggesting an underlying twisting of the dynamin coat itself . Supercoiling could explain the retraction of free tubules and the appearance of dense spots on tubules during their contraction and / or retraction ( red arrowheads in Fig . 2b , c ; Supplementary Movies S3 and S4 ) . Twisting of a helix implies partial rotations of each turn over the adjacent ones , thus resulting in complete rotations when compounded over many turns along the tubule . We investigated whether this is the case . Tubules were generated in the presence of dynamin , or biotinylated dynamin , and negatively charged beads ( 320 nm in diameter ) , or streptavidin - coated polystyrene beads ( 260 nm in diameter ) , respectively . The motility of beads attached to the tubules was then tracked by DIC microscopy ( Fig . 4b , c and Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . No motility was observed before GTP addition . GTP , after a lag phase explained , in part , by its diffusion into the microchamber , triggered both tubule tension and a marked rotation of the beads around the longitudinal axis of the tubule ( Fig . 4b , c ; Supplementary Movie S8 ) . As many as 30 rotations were observed for an individual bead ( see bead tracking traces in Fig . 4c ) , with the speed of rotation decreasing with the number of rotations until the break occurred ( Supplementary Fig . S4a ) . The average maximal speed of bead rotation increased with the GTP concentration ( Fig . 4c , d ) . Rotations could only be observed on ‘free’ tubules , such as those extending from the lipid sheets to the glass surface , as bead movement on these tubules was not hindered by adjacent structures . To further assess the twisting activity , dynamin - coated tubules that had been reacted with GTP in suspension were deposited on grids and examined by electron microscopy . Numerous supercoils were observed ( Fig . 4e ) , in agreement with the ‘convoluted’ appearance previously noted for tubules prepared in similar conditions 17 . The great majority of these supercoils had ‘plus’ conﬁgurations ( Sup - plementary Fig . S4b ) , as expected from a right - handed twist 25 . As dynamin is a right - handed helix 24 , it will further coil , and thus constrict , during a right - handed twist ( Fig . 4e ) . This change is consistent with previous observations made by cryo - EM : ( 1 ) snap - shots of dynamin 1 in the constricted state reveal one or fewer repeating units per turn than in the dilated state 21 , and ( 2 ) both the inner diameter and the pitch of the helix decrease with GTP hydrolysis 17 . The increase in the pitch of the dynamin helix observed on GTP hydrolysis in one study 8 may reﬂect the rigidity of the lipid nanotubes used in that particular study . The resistance to twisting opposed by the nanotubes may have induced a distortion of the dynamin helix . Collectively , the ﬁndings reported here strongly support a mechanical action of dynamin in membrane ﬁssion . When dynamin forms an extended coat , its twisting activity also contributes to a longitudinal contraction that has been exploited in this in vitro study to establish the requirement of membrane tension in dynamin - mediated ﬁssion . If tubules are already under tension ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Movie S6 ) , the constricting activity of dynamin is probably sufﬁcient for ﬁssion . A similar situation may apply to nascent endocytic vesicles , where dynamin may form only a very short spiral ( Fig . 4f ) . Strong biochemical and functional evi - dence 11 – 13 , 26 , 27 has shown that the actin cytoskeleton acts together with dynamin in endocytic ﬁssion . Actin - based mechanisms may provide the required tension 10 , 28 . We suggest that a cooperation of mechanisms that mediate constriction with mechanisms that create membrane tension may also occur in other types of membrane ﬁssion 29 , although the players implicated in the generation of constriction and tension may differ in different contexts .

Dynamin was puriﬁed from rat brains using the GST - tagged SH3 domain of rat amphiphysin2 as an afﬁnity ligand as described 8 , 16 . Conjugation of dynamin to Alexa488 or biotin was carried out by standard procedures . Unlabelled and labelled dynamins were dialysed against storage buffer ( 20mM HEPES , pH7 . 4 , 100mM NaCl , 50 % ( vol . / vol . ) glycerol ) , aliquoted and stored at 2 80 8 C . Formation of membrane sheets . A prewashed glass coverslip stored in ethanol wasdriedunderaN 2 ﬂux , and1 m ldropletsoflipidsolution ( 10mgml 2 1 inpure chloroform ) were deposited and allowed to dry on the coverslip . Lipid - coated coverslips were further dried under vacuum for at least one hour . A small chamber was built by placing the coverslip onto a glass slide , with the lipids facing the glass slide , using double - sided tape as spacers ( see Fig . 2 in ref . 11 ) . The lipids were fully rehydrated by ﬁlling the chamber by capillary action with 15 – 20 m l of buffer ( 0 . 1mgml 2 1 casein in 20mM HEPES , pH7 . 4 , 100mM NaCl , 1mM MgCl 2 ) . Five microlitres of a dynamin solution was then applied and the deformation of membrane sheets was recorded by DIC microscopy at a high resolution ( 1 , 300 £ 1 , 024 pixels ) video rate ( 30 frames per second ) . Five microlitres of nucleotides containing buffer were added after formation of the tubes . All incubations were carried out at room temperature ( approximately 22 8 C ) . Kinesin - induced lipid tubulation . Microtubule - coated chambers between glass slides were prepared as described 20 . Giant liposomes were generated using a modiﬁed protocol from ref . 30 . Tubules were generated as follows : 3 m l of giant liposomes were mixed with 2 m l of 0 . 1mgml 2 1 streptavidin in casein buffer and incubated for 3min . Two microlitres of biotinylated recombinant kinesin ( the plasmid was a gift from P . Bassereau ) was then added , incubated for 5min and mixed with 7 m l of motility buffer ( 2mM ATP , an oxygen scavenger enzymatic system ( see Supplementary Methods for details ) , 10 m M taxol in casein buffer ) 20 . This mix was then added to the microtubule - coated chamber . After a 15 – 20min incubation to allow tubule growth , subsequent injections ( buffers , dynamin , nucleotides ) were performed . All incubations were carried out at room temperature ( approximately 22 8 C ) . Received 30 November 2005 ; accepted 13 March 2006 . Published online 30 April 2006 . 1 . Koenig , J .
