Abstract Background : There are many COVID - 19 vaccines currently available , however , Low - and middle - income countries ( LMIC ) still have large proportions of their populations un - vaccinated . Decision - makers need to take decisions as of how best to allocate available vaccine ( e . g . boosters or primary series vaccination , which age groups to target ) but LMIC often lack the resources to undergo quantitative analyses of vaccine allocation , resulting and ad - hoc policies . We developed Covid19Vaxplorer ( https : / / covid19vaxplorer . fredhutch . org / ) , a free , user - friendly online tool that simulates region - speciﬁc COVID - 19 epidemics in con - junction with vaccination . Methods : We developed an age - structured mathematical model of SARS - CoV - 2 trans - mission and COVID - 19 vaccination . The model considers vaccination with up to three different vaccine products , primary series and boosters . We simulate partial immunity de - rived from waning of natural infection and vaccination . The model is embedded in an an online tool that allows users in 183 regions in the world to compare several vaccination strategies simultaneously , adjusting parameters to their local epidemics , infrastructure and logistics , and reports cumulative number of deaths and epidemic curves . Results : We provide two usage examples of Covid19Vaxplorer for vaccine allocation in Haiti and Afghanistan , which had as of Spring 2023 2 % and 33 % of their populations vaccinated , and show that in these examples , giving primary series vaccinations prevents more deaths than boosters . Covid19Vaxplorer is an online , free , user - friendly tool that facilitates evidence - based decision making for vaccine distribution . 1 .

Introduction The COVID - 19 pandemic has killed more than 6 . 8 million people worldwide as of March 2023 [ 1 ] . There are more than 20 vaccines currently available with various levels of vaccine effectiveness [ 2 ] . High - income countries ( HIC ) have vaccinated and boosted several times the majority of their eligible populations , but only 28 % of the population of low income countries have received at least one dose of vaccine . As of March 2023 , some low - income countries ( LIC ) ( e . g . Haiti , Senegal ) have less than 10 % of their population fully vaccinated [ 3 ] . COVAX , a global effort co - led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ) , the Global Vaccine Alliance ( Gavi ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , was established to dis - tribute donated vaccines to low - and middle - income countries . Because on their dependence on COVAX , LMIC have received , and are likely to continue to receive , a portfolio of several vaccine products , with very different efﬁcacies against speciﬁc variants , forcing public health ofﬁcials in these regions to take decisions about how to best allocate these resources . However , many of these countries lack the resources to develop quantitative models to evaluate possible vaccine allocations , resulting in an ad - hoc allocation of precious resources . There has been an extensive number of mathematical models published for COVID - 19 , and some online tools were developed for simulating SARS - CoV - 2 transmission [ 4 – 6 ] . However , to our knowledge , these tools are usually centered in a single country , state or region . Moreover , most of the research has been centered around HIC , with fewer examples considering LMIC . Existing online tools either have ﬁxed worldwide epidemic projections ( number of deaths , hospital resource use , in - fections ) that are not interactive or they have very limited capabilities for user - input , notably not allowing the user to select multiple vaccines with different efﬁcacies . More importantly , as the pandemic has entered an endemic phase in HIC , and the urgency for modeling vaccine allocation has dissipated in these countries , most of these tools are no longer maintained . We developed Covid19Vaxplorer ( https : / / covid19vaxplorer . fredhutch . org / ) , a free , user - friendly tool that simulates region - speciﬁc COVID - 19 epidemics in conjunction with vaccina - tion campaigns with multiple vaccine products . The aim of our tool is to provide decision - makers in different regions in the world a general framework for vaccine allocation guidance and comparison , allowing public health ofﬁcials in 183 regions ( representing ≥ 97 . 2 % of the global population ) to simulate regional epidemics based on local demographics , epidemiology , logistical constraints , and vaccine availability . The tool produces key outcomes including ex - pected numbers of deaths , hospitalizations and cases , with the possibility of simulating several scenarios of vaccine allocation at once for a side - by - side comparison . The tool is highly ﬂexible and customizable , while remaining very user - friendly . 2 .

The model accounts for infections , reinfections , waning naturally - and vaccine acquired immunity , primary vaccination series and boosters ( single boosters ) . We di - vide the population into ﬁve age groups : 0 – 19 , 20 – 49 , 50 – 64 , 65 – 74 , and those 75 and older . Each age - group is partitioned into nine compartments depending on their vaccination status and degree of protection : unvaccinated ( indexed by α = i ) , partially protected with naturally - induced immunity ( indexed by α = P i ) , or with vaccine - acquired waned immunity , ( indexed by α = W i ) , vaccinated with primary series with vaccine product j ( indexed by α = V ij ) , and vaccinated and boosted with vaccine product j ( indexed by α = B ij ) , i = 1 , 2 , . . . , 5 , and j = 1 , 2 , 3 ( we do not distinguish between different vaccines for primary doses in boosted in - dividuals and assume that only the booster deﬁnes the protection of the individual ) . Each of previous compartments is further stratiﬁed depending on their disease status : susceptible ( S α ) , exposed ( E α ) ( infected but not yet infectious ) , asymptomatic infected ( A α ) , pre - symptomatic infected ( P α ) , symptomatic infected ( I α ) , symptomatic hospitalized ( H α ) , and removed ( asymp - tomatic , symptomatic or hospitalized ) . The removed compartments were split into two phases to allow for a slower representation of the loss of immunity : removed asymptomatic ( RA α or RRA α ) , removed symptomatic ( R α or RR α ) and removed hospitalized ( RH α or RRH α ) . A proportion of those in the removed hospitalized compartment RH α die and are removed from the population . In our model , individuals contact each other in four possible locations : home , work , school and community . We use the values given in [ 9 ] to simulate these contacts . This gives rise to a system with 540 homogeneous compartments . A diagram of the model is given in Fig 1 . The equations for the model and default parameters can be found in the Supplemental Material . Modeling vaccine effectiveness We assumed leaky vaccines [ 10 ] , that have three potential effects : a reduction in the suscepti - bility to infection VE SUS , a reduction in the probability of developing symptoms given infection VE SYMP and a reduction in the probability of developing severe symptoms given symptomatic infection VE SEV . In addition , we assume that those with waned immunity ( either naturally - acquired or vaccine - induced immunity ) would retain some protection against infection , symp - tomatic infection and / or severe infection . 3 .

We do not model individual doses for primary series . We assume that infected symptomatic individuals will not get vacci - nated , so that , at the beginning of each vaccination campaign , we distribute available vaccine among all eligible compartments ( susceptible S α , exposed E α , asymptomatic infected A α , pre - symptomatic infected P α , and all the recovered compartments : RA α , RRA α , R α , RR α , RH α , RRH α , where α = i , P i , W i , V ij or B j with i = 1 , 2 , . . . , 5 and j = 1 , 2 , 3 ) proportionally to their relative size at that point in time . Vaccinated individuals from compartments E α , A α , and P α do no acquire any type of vaccine protection . We calculate the duration of the vaccination campaign according to the daily vaccination rate provided by the user . In our model , all individuals who have been previously vaccinated are moved to the boosted corresponding classes when boosted . That is , irrespective of their current immunity state ( waned or not ) we assume that a booster will renew their protection . For example , individ - uals in compartments S V ij and S P i boosted with vaccine product k would go to the booster compartment B ik . We assume that a single infection confers similar immunity as a primary se - ries vaccination , so that when individuals in the recovered classes ( RA i , RRA i , R i , RR i , RH i and RRH i , with i = 1 , 2 , . . . , 5 ) get vaccinated with vaccine product j , they are moved to the boosted compartment S B ij . Similarly , individuals who are unvaccinated and have had a single infection for whom immunity has waned ( those in the S Pi compartments ) are transferred to the corresponding susceptible vaccinated with a primary series of product j , S V ij Those individu - als who have one infection , have waned immunity , and get vaccinated with vaccine product j after a second infection ( those in the RA Pi , RRA Pi , R Pi , RR Pi , RH Pi , RRH Pi compartments ) are moved to the vaccinated boosted compartment S B ij with i = 1 , 2 , . . . , 5 , j = 1 , 2 , 3 and k = 1 , 2 , 3 . Figure S1 : Flow diagram of the disease progression and vaccine allocations across suscepti - ble ( S α ) , exposed ( E α ) , asymptomatic ( A α ) , pre - symptomatic ( P α ) , symptomatic ( I α ) hospital - ized ( H α ) , removed symptomatic ( Rα , RRα ) , removed asymptomatic ( RAα , RRAα ) , removed hospitalized ( RH α , RRH α ) compartments , α = i , P i , W i , V ij , , V ij . A proportion of those in the hospitalized removed compartments are assumed to die and are removed from the simulation ( arrows omitted for clarity ) . Design Process Covid19Vaxplorer was developed through a user - centered design ( UCD ) [ 11 ] process with the goal of creating a user - friendly tool for supporting non - technical users , including health ofﬁcials , to design vaccine allocation strategies that could lead to a better outcome . It was implemented using modern web frameworks , Vue . js [ 12 ] and Flask [ 13 ] . With the goal of supporting non - technical users such as health ofﬁcials with this tool , the team , which consists of both human - centered researcher and mathematical modelers who have experience working with health ofﬁcials , met regularly to gather requirements on the intended utility of this tool and 4 .

( which was not certified by peer review ) The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 20 , 2023 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2023 . 06 . 15 . 23291472 doi : medRxiv preprint the rationale for having different parameters needed by the model . Because a large number of parameters are required ( 191 parameters per strategy ) , as is usually the case with mathematical models of infectious disease transmission ( e . g . [ 14 , 15 ] , we apply the concept of information architecture [ 16 ] , which emphasizes the importance of organizing information ( e . g . , parameters in our case ) and providing navigation facility in a way that aligns with users’ mental model and workﬂow . Our team adapted the card sorting technique [ 16 ] as a way to build consensus as to how users might conceptually categorize all the parameters needed by the model and to provide a logical ﬂow for specifying different categories of parameters . The team consolidated the proposed information architecture using paper prototyping [ 17 ] and created a low - ﬁdelity prototype ( i . e . , paper - and - pencil sketches ) as an artifact to iterate on the design . Covid19Vaxplorer was designed to avoid saturation and screen tiredness in its users . To achieve this , Covid19Vaxplorer helps them navigate different sets of parameters , starting with basic and simple population characteristics , to a more complicated set of parameter deﬁnitions that are required to characterize the vaccine availability and prioritization scheme . The pro - posed interaction ﬂow consists of 4 sections : “Location” , “Vaccine” , “Vaccine Planning” , and “Outcome” . First , the workﬂow starts with known information about the region of interest , represented as a small set of parameters , including population , the level of social distancing , and current / past infection statistics . Second , Covid19Vaxplorer prompts users to enter vaccine - related information , which in - volves a larger number of parameters compared to the ﬁrst phase , such as the types of vaccines that have been used to date and that will be available for future use , their effectiveness , and the number of people in each age group who were previously vaccinated . Third , users are invited to specify planning - related parameters , including vaccine availabil - ity ( what and when ) , and how vaccines will be allocated to different age groups within the population . Compared to the second “vaccine” phase , here users are expected to actively oper - ationalize their vaccine allocation approaches into the parameters provided by this tool , before seeing the results . Finally , users are presented with projections of key epidemic outcomes based on the in - formation they input . They can explore variations of vaccine allocation strategies to compare the outcomes and evaluate which strategy is more effective . Users are able to go back to any phase to update parameters so that they can understand how those changes affect the projections associated with each allocation strategy . In the next section we describe in more detail each of the phases . Tool Usage Covid19Vaxplorer allows users to input region - speciﬁc parameters ( types of vaccines , num - ber of doses , vaccination rate , circulating variants , demographics , non - pharmaceutical inter - ventions ) and to compare several scenarios of vaccine allocation . Below we describe the tool 6 . CC - BY 4 . 0 International license It is made available under a is the author / funder , who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity .

The tool has 11 main windows divided in four main sections , where each window asks the user to provide speciﬁc information : 1 . Location : In this section , the user provides basic parameters for the region of interest . The section is divided in three windows : ( a ) Region : User selects the region they want to simulate among 183 regions , and the basic reproduction number R 0 ( deﬁned as the average number of secondary infections an infected individual will generate in a fully susceptible population ) . Suggested values of R 0 are provided for several SARS - CoV - 2 variants , based on the numbers given on [ 18 ] . ( b ) Social distancing : User selects how people are practicing social distancing at each location ( home , work , school , community ) if people are practicing social distancing , ranging from “fully social distanced” to “not at all” social distanced . These inputs are translated to the model as multipliers to each of these contact matrices . ( c ) Infection Prevalence : In this window , the user inputs the proportion of people in each age group who have been previously infected ( and who then will have some protection against reinfection , symptoms and / or severe disease ) and those who are currently infected . The window provides default percentages for cumulative prior infection as of November 2021 taken from [ 19 ] . 2 . Vaccine : The vaccine section of the tool is divided in four separate windows to facilitate the users’ input of basic vaccine - related parameters . ( a ) Options : Here , the user selects up to three vaccine products that will be used in the simulation . The user can choose among 10 pre - loaded vaccine products ( the most common vaccine products available in the market for which vaccine effectiveness is readily available ) or can create their own vaccine product ( Figure 2 ) . ( b ) Previous Vaccination : In this window , users input for each age group and each vaccine product , the percentage of that group that has been previously vaccinated either with a primary series or a booster . ( c ) Vaccine effectiveness : Here , the user inputs the vaccine effectiveness for each vac - cine product that was previously selected . For convenience , default values are given for the majority of pre - loaded vaccine products , taken from [ 20 ] . 3 . Vaccine Planning : This section is divided in three windows that facilitate the input of data and parameters by the user : ( a ) Availability : The user inputs the amount of up to three vaccine products that will be available ( same products used in the “Previously vaccinated” window above ) , the date when they will be available and the number of vaccines that will be adminis - tered per day ( vaccination rate ) . 7 .

For each table , the user indicates the percentage of vaccine courses to be given as primary series and / or boosters . Then , the user further determines the per - centage of vaccine to be given to unvaccinated individuals in each age group as primary series ( Primary Series table ) , and the percentage of vaccine to be given in each age group to previously vaccinated individuals as boosters ( Boosters table ) . Covid19Vaxplorer includes features like the toolbox button ( that resets either the Primary series table or the Booster table for any given vaccine ) allowing users to quickly and easily input their vaccine allocation strategy ( Figure 3 ) . ( c ) Period for simulation : The user provides the beginning and end dates for the sim - ulation . Default end dates are provided based on the amounts of vaccine available and vaccination rates , but the simulation end date can be extended beyond that date . ( d ) Additional parameters : This window presents a table with the additional param - eters ( e . g . duration of infectious period , duration of naturally - acquired immunity , proportion of asymptomatic infections ) needed to run the simulation . Default pa - rameter are provided ( values given in Table S1 ) . 4 . Outcome : This is where the results are displayed and visualized . The following key outcomes are given : Cumulative number of deaths over the simulation period , Maximum number of hospitalized individuals , epidemic curves for the daily number of deaths , hos - pitalizations , symptomatic infections and infections . Covid19Vaxplorer allows the user to Edit Duplicate , or Delete a given vaccination strategy , and displays the outcomes in plots next to the original strategy , so that comparisons are easily handled . In addition , the user can use the Export button to download the output of the simulation for further analysis . Note that while Covid19Vaxplorer provides default parameters for all the parameters needed to run the model ( natural history parameters , vaccine - induced and naturally acquired immunity parameters , cumulative infections , etc ) , all of these parameters are customizable by the user , so that they can adapt the tool to their particular needs and circumstances . Results In this section , we provide two examples of the usage of Covid19Vaxplorer and how this can help decision - makers . We consider two possible strategies : Strategy 1 : to give as many boost - ers as possible ( referred below as “Boosters ﬁrst” and Strategy 2 : To give as many primary series as possible ( referred below as “Primary series ﬁrst” ) . For both strategies , vaccination starts with older age groups and goes in decreasing order by age . For example , under in Strategy 1 , we would start vaccinating the oldest age group ( group 5 , 75 years old and older ) , followed 8 .

For the examples below , we consider a 6 month simulation period . Hypothetical scenario : Haiti We explore here a hypothetical scenario for vaccine allocation in Haiti . Based on [ 19 ] , we as - sumed that 29 . 6 % of the population in Haiti had pre - existing immunity . While this number is presumably too low , sensitivity analysis with 80 % pre - existing immunity showed similar qual - itative results with a strategy allocating primary series ﬁrst outperforming the one prioritizing boosters Figure S3 ) . As of March 2023 , 2 . 06 % of the population in Haiti has been fully vacci - nated [ 21 ] . Since we could not ﬁnd any speciﬁc information about which age groups had been previously vaccinated or about which vaccine products have been previously used , we assumed the following : • Health - care professionals were prioritized to be vaccinated ﬁrst . There are approximately 16 , 000 health care professionals in Haiti [ 22 ] , and we assumed them to be distributed among the adult age groups proportionally to the population in each of those age groups . • We assume that the older age groups ( 75 and older and 65 - 75 years old ) were also prior - itized to receive vaccination ﬁrst as availability permitted after health care workers were vaccinated , starting with the oldest age group ﬁrst . • Based on news reports , we assume that the ﬁrst vaccine product given in Haiti was Spike - vax ( Moderna ) . We consider a hypothetical situation in which Haiti would experience a new SARS - CoV - 2 wave with a variant with similar infectivity as the delta variant ( R 0 = 3 ) with 0 . 1 % of the population currently infected . Furthermore , this region would receive an additional 3 . 5 Million vaccine courses over the following 12 weeks split as follows : • 1 Million courses of SPIKEVAX vaccine available immediately , • 1 . 5 Million courses of CONVIDECIA ( Cansino ) vaccine available 7 weeks after receiving the SPIKEVAX vaccines , • 1 Million courses of VERO CELL ( Sinopharm ) vaccine 4 weeks after receiving the CON - VIDECIA vaccine . We assume that for all three vaccines , 50 , 000 individuals can be vaccinated daily . Figure S1 shows the percentage of each age group that would be vaccinated with primary series or boosters under each strategy considered . Using Covid19Vaxplorer ’s capability to compare strategies back to back , we can determine the best vaccination strategy . We simulated both strategies over a 6 month period . Figure 4 11 .

Under the Boosters ﬁrst strategy ( Strategy 1 ) there would be 18 , 223 cumulative deaths at the end of the simulation period and there would be 6 , 852 hospitalizations at the peak of the epidemic wave . In contrast , under the Primary series ﬁrst strategy ( Strategy 2 ) , there would be 14 , 553 cumulative deaths at the end of the simulation period and 6 , 856 hospitalizations at peak . Hence , while the maxi - mum number of hospitalizations is similar , there would be over 3 , 500 more deaths if a strategy favoring boosters was implemented . Hypothetical scenario : Afghanistan Our second example shows a hypothetical scenario for vaccination in Afghanistan . Based on [ 19 ] , we assumed that 84 . 8 % of the population was previously infected . As of March 2023 , 33 % of the population had been fully vaccinated in Afghanistan [ 21 ] . Based on the UNICEF COVID - 19 Market Dashboard [ 23 ] , 19 , 724 , 217 vaccine doses have been assigned to Afghanistan as of February 2023 , with a combination of vaccine products : Sinopharm , Vaxze - vira , Covaxin , Jansen and an unknown vaccine product [ 23 ] . Based on [ 21 ] , we assumed that 10 , 754 , 839 of those have been administered , all of them as primary series . We assumed that vac - cine products were administered in the order they were received , and that the oldest age groups were vaccinated ﬁrst , and younger age groups were vaccinated in decreasing order . Table S3 shows the distribution of previously vaccinated individuals among age groups and vaccine prod - ucts . For this example , we assume that the difference between the vaccine doses that have been assigned and those that have been administered ( 6 , 630 , 189 doses , all Jansen vaccine ) would be administered over the next 6 months , and we compared , as described above , two vaccination strategies : the “Boosters ﬁrst” ( Strategy 1 ) and “Primary series ﬁrst” ( Strategy 2 ) strategies . Because Covid19Vaxplorer allows three different vaccine products at a time , we combined vaccine products with similar vaccine effectiveness , so that we formed three groups : Vaccine 1 with Vaxzevira , Vaccine 2 with Sinopharm , Covaxin and Unknown , and Vaccine 3 with Jansen . Figure S2 shows the two hypothetical distributions by age and previously vaccinated groups . Figure 5 shows a screenshot from the output page of Covid19Vaxplorer . In this example , vaccinating as many people with a primary series is still better than using the vaccine in boost - ers , with 823 less deaths in the former than the latter ( 23 , 084 vs 23 , 907 respectively ) . Moreover , the “Primary series ﬁrst” strategy would result in a much lower hospitalization peak : 5 , 647 hospitalizations at peak compared to 8 , 519 for the “Boosters ﬁrst” strategy . This could be im - portant because it might allow public health ofﬁcials to maintain the healthcare system within working capacity . Discussion The COVID - 19 pandemic has highlighted the need to use quantitative tools to take evidence - based decisions for vaccine distribution .

In particular , decision - makers in LMIC , where large proportions of the population remain unvaccinated and or un - boosted , might face difﬁcult decisions regarding how to allocate COVID - 19 vaccine doses : to give boosters to their high - risk populations or to vaccinate with a primary series their unvacci - nated populations . Yet , many countries lack the resources to quantitatively compare different vaccination strategies . Covid19Vaxplorer , an online tool to simulate and compare different COVID - 19 vaccination strategies , was developed to ﬁll this gap , so that decision - makers around the world have access to a simple tool allowing them to make informed , evidence - based deci - sions . We developed Covid19Vaxplorer with three main factors in mind . First , Covid19Vaxplorer needed to be free , so that anyone in the world could use it . Second , Covid19Vaxplorer needed to be online , so that it would be accessible for anyone with internet access . Finally , Covid19Vaxplorer needed to be easy to use , so that decision makers , with or without math - ematical experience , could use it to compare potential vaccination strategies . This last point proved to be the most difﬁcult to achieve , as we needed to strike a balance between a simple enough tool to be user - friendly and a realistic enough mathematical model to provide useful vaccine allocation comparisons . Covid19Vaxplorer , as all mathematical models , is subject to several limitations includ - ing the following : First , the model does not distinguish between ﬁrst and second doses and encompass both under a primary series label . While it incorporates product - speciﬁc informa - tion about the length of vaccine - induced immunity and its effectiveness , it assumes a single duration of immunity for waned vaccinated individuals following a SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Covid19Vaxplorer is not ﬁtted to any epidemic in particular , rather , it provides generally ac - cepted values for the most common parameters . While the user can modify the parameters for their own region , it is not suited to make projections and it should not be used or construed in such a way . Rather , the value of Covid19Vaxplorer relies in its ability to allow users to make back - to - back comparisons of vaccination strategies . Acknowledgments We thank Dr .

Vaccination Rate . We denote with V ij ( t ) the number of vaccines of vaccine product j to allocate per day among the available individuals X i ( t ) from age - group i at time t ≥ 0 , i = 1 , 2 , . . . , 5 , j = 1 , 2 , 3 . The vaccination rate at time t is θ i ( t ) = θ X i toXV ij ( t ) = (cid:40) 0 if t > t ∗ min { X i ( t ) , V ij ( t ) } if 0 ≤ t ≤ t ∗ , ( 6 ) where t ∗ is the ending time of the vaccination campaign with vaccine type j . Data sources and model default parameters Population structure : We use contact matrices for regions given in [ 9 ] . The contact matrices for the following regions : Australia , Haiti , Japan , Lebanon , Somalia , Taiwan were imputed by assuming similar contacts as the neighboring countries ( New Zealand , Dominican Republic , South Korea , Syria , Djibouti and South Korea respectively ) . For each region , the total population and age distribution were obtained from [ 24 ] , with population densities correspond to the 2022 estimates . Vaccine effectiveness : Vaccine effectiveness parameters were based on the data presented in [ 19 ] . We assume that there is a multiplicative relationship between the vaccine efﬁcacy against laboratory - conﬁrmed COVID - 19 disease , VE DIS , VE SUS and VE SYMP [ 25 ] , so that VE DIS = 1 − ( 1 − VE SUS ) ( 1 − VE SYMP ) . ( 7 ) And similarly , VE SEV = 1 − ( 1 − VE H ) ( 1 − VE SYMP ) . ( 8 ) Using this relationship and early vaccine effectiveness estimates , we derived VE SYMP and VE H from given estimates for VE DIS and VE SEV . Furthermore , when vaccine effectiveness estimates were not available for Omicron , we imputed them in the following way : we computed the reduction in the ef - fectiveness between ancestral strain and Omicron for those vaccine products for which the data was available , and use that as a multiplier for those products for which we could not ﬁnd an estimate . Table summarizes the default values for vaccine effectiveness for each vaccine product provided . 25 .
