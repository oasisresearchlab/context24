Integrins mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and enable the construction of complex , multicellular organisms , yet fundamental aspects of integrin - based adhesion remain poorly understood . Notably , the magnitude of the mechanical load experienced by individual integrins within living cells is unclear , due principally to limitations inherent to existing techniques . Here we use FRET - based molecular tension sensors ( MTSs ) to directly measure the distribution of loads experienced by individual integrins in living cells . We find that a large fraction of integrins bear modest loads of 1 - 3 pN , while subpopulations bearing higher loads are enriched within adhesions . Further , our data indicate that integrin engagement with the fibronectin synergy site , a secondary binding site specifically for α 5 β 1 integrin , leads to increased levels of α 5 β 1 integrin recruitment to adhesions but not to an increase in overall cellular traction generation . The presence of the synergy site does , however , increase cells’ resistance to detachment by externally applied loads . We suggest that a substantial population of integrins experiencing loads well below their peak capacities can provide cells and tissues with mechanical integrity in the presence of widely varying mechanical loads . Keywords : integrin ; cell adhesion ; mechanobiology ; single molecule ; tension sensor Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins that link the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) to the cell cytoskeleton and critically influence cell migration , proliferation , and differentiation . Integrins are composed of an α and β subunit , of which 18 and 8 have been identified in humans , respectively . 1 Multiple integrin classes have been implicated in the ability of cells to transform mechanical stimuli such as substrate rigidity , fluid shear , and stretch into intracellular signaling , 2 – 9 a process termed mechanotransduction . The fibronectin binding integrins α v β 3 and α 5 β 1 in particular have attracted considerable interest as drug development targets due to their central roles in wound healing , angiogenesis , and cancer metastasis . 10 , 11 Although integrins are acknowledged to play a central role in transmitting and sensing mechanical force , how they do so at a molecular level remains poorly understood . Even the force transmitted by individual integrin heterodimers remains uncertain , with reported values spanning 1 to > 100 pN . 12 – 18 Thus , it is unclear if integrin - based adhesion , and by extension Page 1 of 16 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Nano 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 mechanotransduction , reflects a disproportionate contribution by only a few integrins bearing large forces ( here , > 30 pN ) , or is instead a collective phenomenon reflecting the cumulative output of many weaker interactions . Conventional techniques are not well - suited to address this problem : both traction force microscopy ( TFM ) and micropillar array measurements report forces averaged over many integrins , while existing single - molecule techniques such as atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and optical tweezers do not recapitulate the complex environment of a cellular adhesion . Recently , we and others have developed fluorescence - based molecular probes that measure force at integrin - based adhesions either by changes in Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) 12 , 19 – 21 or by the force - induced dissociation of DNA duplexes . 22 , 23 Measurements of this kind have improved the spatial resolution of integrin - based tension measurements to ~ 50 nm , 19 thereby revealing distinct heterogeneities in local forces within single adhesions . However , to our knowledge the basic question of how forces are apportioned among integrin molecules remains unaddressed . Results Single - molecule molecular tension sensor ( MTS ) measurements quantify loads experienced by individual integrin heterodimers Here , we used improved molecular tension sensors ( MTSs ) 12 , 19 to measure the distribution of forces experienced by individual integrin heterodimers within the adhesion complexes of living cells ( Figure 1 , see Supplementary Note ) . To gain further insight into how integrin engagement alters force production , we engineered MTSs presenting either a linear arginine - glycine - aspartate ( RGD ) - containing peptide derived from fibronectin , here termed MTS RGD , or the complete fibronectin type III 9 th and 10 th domains ( FNIII 9 - 10 ) , termed MTS FN9 - 10 ( Figure 1a , Figure S1 - 2 , Table S1 ) . MTS RGD provides a minimal binding site for fibronectin - binding integrins ( in our system , primarily α v β 3 and α 5 β 1 ) , while MTS FN9 - 10 includes a secondary binding site for α 5 β 1 integrin , termed the “synergy site” , that is thought to play an essential role in the formation of a force - resistant catch bond between α 5 β 1 integrin and fibronectin . 13 , 24 To investigate specific contributions of the synergy site , we constructed a third sensor , termed MTS FN9 * - 10 , that is identical to MTS FN9 - 10 except that the synergy site motif PHSRN ( fibronectin residues 1376 - 1380 ) is replaced with SPSDN , the corresponding inactive sequence from FNIII 8 ( Figure 1a , Figure S3 , Table S1 ) . 25 , 26 Cells did not spread on MTSs lacking an integrin - binding domain ( Figure S4 ) .

Molecular tension sensors . a ) MTSs contain an N - terminal , cysteine - free HaloTag domain , two reactive cysteines for attachment of a FRET donor and acceptor , an elastic spring domain derived from spider silk , and a C - terminal integrin binding ligand : a linear RGD peptide derived from fibronectin ( MTS RGD ) , the FNIII 9 - 10 domains ( MTS FN9 - 10 ) , or the FNIII 9 - 10 domains with an inactive synergy site ( MTS FN9 * - 10 ) .

Cell - generated force pulls the FRET donor and acceptor apart , causing a decrease in FRET efficiency . The force / FRET relation for the spring domain has been previously calibrated , 16 , 28 allowing us to relate FRET efficiency to force ( see Supporting Information and Figure S9 ) . c ) When fluorescently labeled sensors are attached to a coverslip at high density and cells are allowed to spread on the surface , imaging the FRET donor and acceptor fluorescence yields a high - resolution traction map . FRET index , defined here as the ratio of acceptor intensity over summed donor and acceptor intensity , is used as a relative measure for FRET efficiency : a low FRET index indicates high force and a high FRET index indicates low force .

We first quantified the forces experienced by individual integrin heterodimers by measuring the FRET efficiencies of MTS RGD and MTS FN9 - 10 molecules located underneath human foreskin fibroblasts ( HFFs ) expressing GFP - paxillin , a focal adhesion marker ( Figure 2 , Figure S5 , see Supporting Information “Calculating single - molecule FRET efficiency” ) . In this measurement , HFFs adhered to coverslip surfaces on which only 1 in 1000 MTSs were fluorescently labeled , allowing us to measure FRET efficiencies for single sensor molecules ( Figure 2a , b , Figure S6 ) . We observed a prominent peak in the FRET distribution at ~ 80 % FRET , similar to the FRET efficiencies measured in the absence of cells ( Figure 2c , Figure S7 - 8 ) , as well as smaller subpopulations with FRET efficiencies of ~ 60 % and ~ 20 % , indicative of probes experiencing appreciable loads ( Figure 2c , Figure S9 - 10 ) . These low - FRET subpopulations were enriched within adhesions ( Figure 2c and Figure S10 ) . FRET efficiencies were converted to forces using a FRET - force calibration curve generated from a phenomenological fit to pre - existing calibration data for the elastic spring domain ( Figure S9 , Figure S11 , see Supporting Information “Obtaining theoretical FRET - force calibration curve” ) . 16 Page 3 of 16 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Nano 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 Figure 2 .

For the cell as a whole , this analysis indicated that 60 % and 40 % of MTS RGD and MTS FN9 - 10 probes were bound to an integrin ( Figure 2d , Table S4 , see Supporting Information “Estimating unbound fraction of MTSs” ) . These fractions are consistent with single - molecule tracking measurements suggesting that ~ 50 % of β 3 and β 1 integrins are immobilized outside focal adhesions , 29 though the mechanism of immobilization in the earlier study was unclear . Of the integrin - bound MTS RGD and MTS FN9 - 10 sensors , we found that approximately 80 % and 60 % experienced forces of 1 - 3 pN , 20 % and 30 % experienced loads of 3 - 7 pN , and a small population ( < 10 % ) bore loads larger than the MTS could measure ( > 7 pN ) ( Figure 2d , e , Table S4 ) . This high force subpopulation was enriched within adhesions , with 20 % of load - bearing MTS RGD and MTS FN9 - 10 molecules experiencing forces > 7 pN ( Figure 2d , e , Table S4 ) . The exact magnitude of these higher - force binding interactions is outside the dynamic range of the MTSs used here , but can be addressed using sensors tuned to higher forces . 21 , 22 , 30 Importantly , our data account for the large discrepancy in reported force values : while a few integrins potentially exert substantial forces , the majority of ligand - bound integrins for the cell as a whole exert modest forces of 1 - 7 pN . To test if the forces transmitted by integrins were dependent on linkage to the actin cytoskeleton , we treated cells with cytochalasin D , an F - actin barbed end - capper . We observed that treating HFFs with 1 µM cytochalasin D led to rapid disassembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions at the cell periphery within minutes of drug addition , before the cell shape appreciably changed ( Figure S12 ) . The FRET / force distributions of MTS RGD molecules measured under these conditions revealed that low FRET / high force events ( > 7 pN ) were essentially absent while those at lower forces ( ~ 3 pN or less ) remained ( Figure 2e , Table S5 ) . This result suggests that the higher force interactions require connections to a contractile actin cytoskeleton , while minimally tensioned integrin - MTS linkages do not . These data likewise imply that integrins bearing small loads are sufficient for maintaining adhesion at shorter time scales , since cells remained adhered to the coverslip over the course of the experiment ( ~ 1 h ) . The fibronectin synergy site influences integrin recruitment to adhesions but not overall traction generation The synergy site on fibronectin , which is present in MTS FN9 - 10 but not MTS RGD , has been implicated in the formation of a force - resistant catch bond with α 5 β 1 integrin . 13 , 24 It might be expected that the presence of the synergy site would lead to an increase in cellular traction forces due to catch bond formation , α 5 β 1 integrin - dependent myosin II activation , 6 , 7 or both . However , this did not appear to be the case in our measurements : forces at the single - molecule level measured with MTS RGD and MTS FN9 - 10 were qualitatively similar . Also contrary to expectations , high force ( > 7 pN ) binding events within adhesions were more prevalent for cells adhering to MTS RGD as compared to MTS FN9 - 10 . This result is remarkable given that both α v β 3 and α 5 β 1 integrin have higher binding affinities for the FNIII 9 - 10 domains than for linear , RGD - containing peptides , 31 suggesting that the force exerted by integrins is not set solely by their affinity for a given ligand . To probe the robustness of this result , we next characterized cellular force production at the whole cell level . To do so , we imaged GFP - paxillin expressing HFFs adhering to coverslips Page 5 of 16 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Nano 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 functionalized with a continuous field of fluorescently labeled MTSs , which produces a high resolution traction force map ( Figure 3a ) . For each pixel , the measured FRET value was used to define an average force per sensor , for regions within and outside of adhesions . This ensemble measurement combines contributions from both unbound and bound probes , the latter of which may also include probes that are experiencing loads beyond their dynamic range ( see Supporting Information “Ensemble FRET analysis” ) . The force per sensor measured in this way is thus likely to represent a lower bound for the actual average force per sensor within a given pixel . With this proviso in mind , we found that cells displayed a small but statistically significant higher average force per sensor within adhesions when adhering to MTS RGD vs . MTS FN9 - 10 ( 2 . 6 ± 0 . 09 pN vs . 2 . 3 ± 0 . 08 pN ; mean ± S . E . M . ) ( Figure 3b , c ) . This trend was consistent with the median force values calculated from single molecule measurements within adhesions ( 2 . 6 pN for MTS RGD vs . 1 . 5 pN for MTS FN9 - 10 ) . Likewise , the larger difference between forces measured within adhesions relative to outside of adhesions on MTS RGD was also recapitulated ( Figure 3b , c , Figure 2d ) . Thus , single - molecule FRET measurements were representative of force production on the cellular level . We further separated adhesions based on their location into peripheral and central adhesions ( Figure 3b , c , see Supporting Information ) . We found that while peripheral adhesions displayed higher average force values for cells adhering to MTS RGD than MTS FN9 - 10 , cells adhering to MTS FN9 - 10 generated modest but significantly higher average forces at the small , centrally located adhesions ( Figure 3b , c ) . Separating adhesions based on size alone reproduced this trend : smaller adhesions displayed higher average forces for cells adhering to MTS FN9 - 10 versus MTS RGD ( Figure S13 ) .

To address the possibility that the > 7 pN events corresponded to higher forces on MTS FN9 - 10 than on MTS RGD but that it was indistinguishable due to the sensors’ dynamic range , we measured total cellular traction using TFM . To our knowledge , a comparison of the cellular traction force outputs as measured by fluorescent force sensors and by more conventional methods such as TFM has not been reported . MTS FRET is measured on glass ( GPa stiffness ) while TFM requires a deformable substrate ( up to 100 kPa ) , posing a potential limitation in achieving a direct comparison . However , previous studies have shown that cellular traction Page 7 of 16 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Nano 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 forces plateau above a rigidity threshold . 32 , 33 We therefore performed conventional TFM for HFFs adhering to 18 and 47 kPa polyacrylamide gels , both of which were expected to be above this critical rigidity , functionalized with fibronectin , MTS RGD , or MTS FN9 - 10 ( Figure 3e , f , Figure S14 ) . For a given ligand , we observed comparable total forces on the 18 kPa versus 47 kPa substrate , suggesting we were within or nearing the plateau region of maximal cellular traction production . On the stiffer , 47 kPa surfaces we found that the total forces per cell measured by TFM for fibronectin , MTS RGD , and MTS FN9 - 10 were statistically indistinguishable , and similar in magnitude to those we obtained from MTS FRET maps ( Figure 3d , f ) . Thus , cellular traction forces measured via MTS and TFM were comparable under the circumstances studied here , and did not depend strongly on the integrin ligand . We next examined whether cell engagement with the synergy site might influence adhesion structure or composition . HFFs express both α 5 β 1 and α v β 3 integrins ( Figure S15 ) , and cells plated on MTS FN9 - 10 displayed α 5 β 1 integrin - rich adhesions both as large plaques at the cell periphery and smaller adhesions under the cell body , a phenotype similar to that of cells plated on full - length fibronectin ( Figure 4a , Figure S16 ) . These smaller α 5 β 1 integrin - rich adhesions likely correspond to the centrally located force - producing regions observed with MTS FRET at the ensemble level ( Figure 3a , b ) . In contrast , α 5 β 1 integrin recruitment to peripheral adhesions was largely abrogated in HFFs seeded on coverslips functionalized with MTS RGD , an observation consistent with prior results 19 and recapitulated for cells adhering to MTS FN9 * - 10 ( Figure 4a , Figure S16 ) . Also consistent with prior results , α v β 3 integrin localized solely to large adhesions at the cell periphery on all surfaces ( Figure 4a , Figure S16 ) . To further examine the colocalization of integrins with tension , we fixed HFFs plated on MTS FN9 - 10 or MTS FN9 * - 10 and stained for either α 5 β 1 or α v β 3 integrin using an Alexa488 - tagged secondary antibody ( Figure 4b ) . Consistent with prior work , imaging immediately after fixation allowed us to colocalize low FRET / high force signals with specific proteins detected by immunohistochemistry . Using this approach , we found that both α v β 3 and α 5 β 1 integrins colocalized with cellular traction force to a similar , moderate degree for cells adhering to MTS FN9 - 10 ( Figure 4b , c ) . In contrast , α v β 3 integrin colocalization with low FRET / high force was significantly higher than that of α 5 β 1 integrin for cells adhering to MTS FN9 * - 10 , consistent with results derived with MTS RGD ( Figure 4c ) . 19 Staining HFFs for either paxillin or both α v β 3 and α 5 β 1 simultaneously revealed that the 2D correlation with force was higher than that of either integrin alone , and was statistically similar for cells adhering to either MTS FN9 - 10 or MTS FN9 * - 10 ( Figure 4c ) . These results suggest that the presence or absence of the synergy site altered relative α v β 3 and α 5 β 1 integrin recruitment , but not total integrin or paxillin recruitment under the conditions examined here . Engagement with the fibronectin synergy site contributes to robust adhesion in the presence of external load . As discussed above , in our assays integrin engagement with the fibronectin synergy site led to changes in integrin localization , but not to meaningful changes in force output at either the single - integrin or whole - cell levels . However , beyond their role in traction force transmission , integrins play an essential role in ensuring robust adhesion of the cell to the ECM in the face of externally generated loads , for example during embryonic development and wound repair . 34 , 35 Page 8 of 16 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Nano 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 Indeed , previous evidence implicates an interaction between α 5 β 1 integrin and the fibronectin synergy site in robust cell adhesion . 24 To further probe a specific role for this interaction in adhesion , we tested the ability of cells to resist detachment from MTS - coated coverslips using a modification of a previously described centrifugal adhesion assay . 36 , 37 Briefly , HFFs were seeded onto chambers coated with equimolar concentrations of MTS RGD , MTS FN9 - 10 , or MTS FN9 * - 10 and allowed to attach for 10 min before being centrifuged upside down to apply a sedimentation force ( see Supporting Information “Centrifugal adhesion assay” ) . The fraction of cells that remain attached is an indicator of adhesion strength . Consistent with prior measurements , HFFs seeded on MTS FN9 - 10 functionalized surfaces displayed significantly higher adhesion strength as compared to cells adhering to MTS RGD or MTS FN9 * - 10 ( Figure 4d ) . Thus , in this assay the presence of the fibronectin synergy site led to enhanced cell adhesion in the presence of externally generated mechanical loads . Figure 4 .

Conclusions We used MTSs to directly address how loads are distributed among individual integrin molecules . Previous estimates for the forces experienced by individual integrins range from ~ 1 to > 100 pN . 12 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 20 – 23 , 38 Lower estimates have typically come from dividing the traction generated by individual adhesions by the total number of recruited integrins , 18 , 38 while higher force estimates were derived from integrin - mediated bond rupture measurements 13 , 39 or the use of fluorescent DNA hairpins of known unfolding force . 22 , 23 Our data resolve this apparent discrepancy : at least in our model system , a majority of ligand - bound integrins exert modest forces of 1 - 7 pN , ~ 10 - fold lower than the maximal forces that integrins can potentially bear . 13 , 15 , 17 , 21 However , a smaller population experiencing forces larger than we can measure is enriched within adhesions , consistent with prior measurements indicating that at least a fraction of integrins experience substantial loads . 20 - 23 Exactly how forces are distributed within this higher force population is unknown and is an interesting topic for future investigations . At least in our measurements , the presence of the fibronectin synergy site did not lead to an increase in either overall cellular traction ( Figure 3d , f ) or loads measured at the single - integrin level ( Figure 2d ) . However , consistent with prior work , 24 interaction with the synergy site increased the ability of cells to resist detachment when exposed to external load ( Figure 4d ) . How exactly this occurs at a molecular level is not clear : resistance to detachment could occur via integrin - mediated catch bonds , 13 mechanical reinforcement at the level of single integrins , 39 increased integrin recruitment , or a combination of all of the above . Future studies incorporating changes in MTS density , additional small - molecule based cytoskeletal perturbations , and similar strategies offer a means of differentiating between these and other potential mechanisms of integrin - based mechanosensing . Our observations support a conceptual distinction between the role of integrins in transmitting cytoskeletally generated traction forces and in mediating robust adhesion of the cell to its substrate . Roughly 50 % of MTS RGD and MTS FN9 - 10 molecules outside of defined adhesions experienced measurable loads ( Figure 2d ) , and integrins transmitting approximately 3 pN or less were sufficient to maintain adhesion when the actin cytoskeleton and large adhesions were abrogated by treatment with cytochalasin D ( Figure 2e ) . This integrin population , which would be difficult to observe using other existing techniques , may provide a large pool of engaged but minimally tensioned integrins that can resist cell detachment on short timescales to impart cells and tissues with mechanical integrity . Methods Cell culture HFFs ( ATCC , CRL - 2091 ) were cultured in high glucose DMEM ( Gibco 21063 - 045 ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Corning MT35011CV ) , 1 mM sodium pyruvate ( Life Technologies 10010 - 023 ) , 1x MEM non - essential amino acids ( Life Technologies Page 10 of 16 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Nano 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 11140050 ) , and 100 U / ml penicillin / streptomycin ( Life Technologies 15140122 ) , herein referred to as normal culture media . Cells were incubated at 37 ̊C with 5 % CO 2 . Cells stably expressing GFP - paxillin ( GFP at C - terminus ) were described previously 18 and cultured identically . Cloning Human fibronectin type III repeats 9 and 10 were cloned from FN 108 ( Addgene Plasmid # 50495 ) into an existing MTS RGD construct in the pJExpress414 bacterial expression vector 19 ( DNA 2 . 0 ) , replacing the linear RGD sequence and inserting a TEV cleavage site preceding the FN repeats . The existing TAG stop codon for unnatural amino incorporation was mutated using Quikchange mutagenesis ( Agilent ) to incorporate a reactive cysteine , using the primer 5 ' - ggcggtgctggcgaattcggtaagtgcggccctggtgg - 3 ' and its complement . A C - terminal 6xHis tag was used for purification . The HaloTag domain’s two native cysteines were previously mutated to serines , without loss of function . 19 The full amino acid sequences of MTSs are provided in Table S1 . Preparation of dye - labeled MTSs Briefly , sensor proteins were produced using bacterial expression in E . coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) and purified using Ni - NTA HisPur resin ( Thermo Pierce 88222 ) . Donor and acceptor dye labeling was achieved using a dual - cysteine labeling strategy with maleimide - conjugated Alexa546 and Alexa647 dyes ( Life Technologies A10258 , A20347 ) in a 1 : 2 : 1 . 5 protein : Alexa647 : Alexa546 ratio . Sensors labeled with both donor and acceptor were separated from MTSs labeled with only the donor or acceptor on a MonoQ PC 1 . 6 / 5 column ( GE Healthcare 17 - 0671 - 01 ) using an AKTApure FPLC ( GE Healthcare ) ( see Supporting Information “Labeling of MTS constructs” ) . Flow cell preparation Perfusion chambers ( Grace Biolabs 622103 ) were adhered to HaloLigand / PEG - functionalized coverslips . Fluorophore labeled or unlabeled MTSs ( 100 nM ) were added to the flow cell and incubated at room temperature for 30 min , washed with PBS twice , and further passivated with 0 . 2 % w / v Pluronic F - 127 for 5 minutes . Channels were washed once with PBS before adding freshly trypsinized HFFs in normal culture media and incubated at 37 ̊C with 5 % CO 2 . Cells were typically allowed to spread for 1 h before imaging , and not imaged for longer than 4 hours after seeding . Chamber inlets and outlets were sealed with tape before imaging to prevent drying out , and cells were imaged at 37 ̊C using an objective heater ( Bioptechs ) . Single - molecule FRET / force measurements Single - molecule FRET efficiency data were acquired by constant excitation with 532 nm at 5 frames / sec for 600 frames , with direct acceptor excitation at 635 nm at approximately frame 100 for 10 frames . This strategy was employed to aid in differentiating between MTSs with low FRET values versus those lacking a FRET acceptor . Single - molecule FRET calculations were done using custom - made MATLAB code ( see Supporting Information “Calculating single - molecule FRET efficiency” ) . To estimate the fraction of unbound MTS molecules , we fit the cumulative distributions of single - molecule FRET efficiencies to a sum of Gaussians . The highest FRET efficiency population was similar to the no - load FRET efficiency measured in the absence of cells ( Table S2 , Figure S7 ) . This subpopulation was therefore assigned as the MTSs Page 11 of 16 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Nano 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 under zero load ( i . e . not bound to an integrin ) ( see Supporting Information “Estimating unbound fraction of MTSs” ) . The FRET vs . force response of the ( GPGGA ) 8 linker used here was previously reported by Grashoff et al . 16 We adjusted this calibration to account for the biophysical and photophysical properties of the MTSs used here ( see Supporting Information “Obtaining theoretical FRET - force calibration curve” ) .
