SPECIAL SECTION ON COVID - 19 : QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH Study of the epidemiology of COVID - 19 in Ontario elementary and secondary school education workers : an interim analysis following the first school year Brenda L . Coleman 1 , 2 & Kailey Fischer 1 & Robert Maunder 1 , 2 & John Kim 3 & Sharon Straus 2 , 4 & Susan Bondy 2 & Allison McGeer 1 , 2 Received : 20 September 2021 / Accepted : 24 January 2022 # The Author ( s ) under exclusive license to The Canadian Public Health Association 2022 Abstract Objective To estimate the incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 in education workers and the factors associated with infection between March 2020 and July 2021 . Methods A prospective cohort study of education workers working ≥ 8 h per week in Ontario , Canada . Participants self - reported results of tests for SARS - CoV - 2 and completed online surveys about demographic information , exposures , and vaccinations against SARS - CoV - 2 . Participants submitted self - collected dried blood spots . Antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 spike , the receptor binding domain of spike , and nucleocapsid were assessed . Multivariable regression was used to assess risk factors for infection . Results Of 2834 participants , 85 % were female , 81 % were teaching staff , and 86 % had received at least one dose of SARS - CoV - 2 vaccine . Of the 1983 who had been tested via a respiratory specimen , 4 . 9 % reported a positive test . Five additional participants had serologic testing suggestive of a previous infection ( 3 . 6 % overall incidence ) . In multivariable regression analysis , risk factors for infection included exposure to a SARS - CoV - 2 infected adult ( adjusted incidence rate ratio ( aIRR ) 13 . 6 ; 95 % confidence interval 8 . 6 , 21 . 3 ) or child ( aIRR 2 . 3 ; 1 . 3 , 4 . 2 ) in the household , or school student ( aIRR 1 . 9 ; 1 . 2 , 3 . 2 ) , or travel outside the province within 14 days of testing ( aIRR 6 . 0 ; 1 . 5 , 23 . 6 ) . Conclusion In the first 18 months of the pandemic , education workers had a similar risk of infection with SARS - CoV - 2 as other Ontario residents . Practicing protective measures whenever any household member has been exposed to a possible case and at all times when exposed to anyone from outside the home would help reduce the risk of infection . Résumé Objectif Estimer l ’ incidence du SRAS - CoV - 2 chez les travailleuses et les travailleurs en éducation et les facteurs associés à l ’ infection entre mars 2020 et juillet 2021 . Méthode Étude prospective de cohortes auprès de travailleuses et de travailleurs en éducation travaillant ≥ 8 heures par semaine en Ontario , au Canada . Les participants ont autodéclaré les résultats de tests de dépistage du SRAS - CoV - 2 et répondu à des questionnaires en ligne portant sur leurs données démographiques , leurs expositions au SRAS - CoV - 2 et leurs vaccins contre le virus . Les participants ont soumis des gouttes de sang séché autoprélevées . Les anticorps à la protéine S du SRAS - CoV - 2 , le domaine de liaison aux récepteurs de la protéine S et la nucléocapside ont été évalués . Une régression multivariée a servi à évaluer les facteurs de risque d ’ infection . Résultats Sur les 2 834 participants , 85 % étaient des femmes , 81 % étaient des enseignants et 86 % avaient reçu au moins une dose de vaccin contre le SRAS - CoV - 2 . Sur les 1 983 personnes ayant été testées au moyen d ’ un prélèvement respiratoire , 4 , 9 % * Brenda L . Coleman Brenda .

Chez cinq autres participants , un test sérologique a indiqué une infection antérieure ( incidence globale de 3 , 6 % ) . Selon l ’ analyse de régression multivariée , les facteurs de risque d ’ infection étaient l ’ exposition à un adulte infecté par le SRAS - CoV - 2 ( rapport de taux d ’ incidence ajusté [ RTIa ] 13 , 6 ; intervalle de confiance de 95 % 8 , 6 , 21 , 3 ) ou à un enfant infecté ( RTIa 2 , 3 ; 1 , 3 , 4 , 2 ) au sein du ménage , l ’ exposition à un élève infecté ( RTIa 1 , 9 ; 1 , 2 , 3 , 2 ) ou un déplacement hors province dans les 14 jours ayant précédé le test ( RTIa 6 , 0 ; 1 , 5 , 23 , 6 ) . Conclusion Au cours des 18 premiers mois de la pandémie , le risque d ’ infection par le SRAS - CoV - 2 chez les travailleuses et les travailleurs en éducation était semblable au risque des autres résidents de l ’ Ontario . L ’ application de mesures de protection chaque fois qu ’ un membre du ménage a été exposé à un cas possible , et en tout temps lorsqu ’ on est exposé à une personne de l ’ extérieur du ménage , contribuerait à réduire le risque d ’ infection . Keywords COVID - 19 . Education . Cohort . Risk factors Mots - clés COVID - 19 . éducation . cohorte . facteurs de risque Introduction Teachers and other education workers may be at increased risk of coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) due to their close and prolonged contact with students , co - workers , parents , and vol - unteers . Like other adults , they are also exposed to their own household members , extended family and friends , and other members of the public . The contribution of schools to overall transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 and the occupational risk to education workers remains uncertain . Certainly , the highest risk of transmis - sion is to family members in the same household ( Liu et al . , 2020 ; Madewell et al . , 2020 ) . Several prospective studies done in educational settings have reported that staff - to - staff transmission risk is significantly higher than staff - to - child or child - to - staff ( Bi et al . , 2021 ; Gandini et al . , 2021 ; Macartney et al . , 2020 ; Meuris et al . , 2021 ; Varma et al . , 2021 ) . The objective of this interim analysis was to estimate the cumulative incidence of COVID - 19 in Ontario ’ s teachers and education workers during the first 18 months of the pandemic , and to identify workplace - , community - , and individual - level risk and protective factors for COVID - 19 in this population . Background and context Ontario is the largest province in Canada , with 14 . 7 million citizens . Its 3967 elementary and 877 secondary public schools and 1250 private schools serve over 2 million students and employ over 160 , 000 full - time equivalent staff ( Ontario Ministry of Education , 2021 ; York Region tutoring , 2018 ) . Concerns about the spread of COVID - 19 triggered the closure of all schools on March 12 , 2020 , with remote learning insti - tuted until June 30 , 2020 . Schools were re - opened to fully remote , fully face - to - face , and hybrid ( combined online and in - person classes ) learning on September 8 , 2020 , with staggered opening dates . Schools in high COVID - 19 activity regions were closed again on January 8 , 2021 , but all were reopened by February 16 th . Elementary and secondary schools were closed to in - person learning again on April 12 th and did not re - open for the remainder of the 2020 – 2021 school year ( Gallagher - Mackay et al . , 2021 ; Government of Ontario , 2020a ) . During closures , all students were able to participate in remote / online learning . During open periods , remote learning was available for those who chose it . Staff and students in grades 4 to 12 were required to wear masks indoors , on school property , on school vehicles , and outdoors when a 2 m distance could not be maintained at the beginning of the 2020 / 2021 school year ( Government of Ontario , 2020b ) . This was expanded to grades 1 – 12 in January 2021 ( Government of Ontario , 2021 ) . Kindergarten students were not required to but were encouraged to wear masks in indoor spaces while special accommodations were made for students with special education needs . Staff and students were asked to stay home and self - isolate if they failed daily screening for symptoms compatible with COVID - 19 . Of note , individual school boards could insti - tute requirements beyond those mandated by the provin - cial government . A limited supply of vaccine against COVID - 19 became available in Ontario on December 14 , 2020 , with increas - ing supply over the first 6 months of 2021 . A phased rollout of vaccines followed , with some education workers eligible as early as April , but most eligible starting in May 2021 ( Ontario Ministry of Health , 2021 ) . Youth aged 12 years or older become eligible for vacci - nation starting May 23 , 2021 . Most Ontario adults were vaccinated with the Pfizer - BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines , with a smaller percentage receiving the viral vector vaccine produced by AstraZeneca . The Pfizer - BioNTech vaccine was the only vaccine approved for use in youth aged 12 – 17 years in Canada until late August 2021 . 186 Can J Public Health ( 2022 ) 113 : 185 – 195 Methods The COVID - 19 Cohort Study of teachers and education workers is a prospective cohort study that started enrolling participants on February 18 , 2021 . The study is open to all education workers ( teachers , educational assistants , school of - fice staff , custodians , librarians , early childhood educators , etc . ) aged 18 – 74 years , employed in any capacity in an Ontario school or school board , working an average of ≥ 8 h / week ( remote or in person ) during the 2020 – 2021 school year , and planning to continue working for at least 3 months after enrolment . To permit dried blood spot ( DBS ) self - collection , eligibility was restricted to those who did not have a bleeding disorder , had not received chemotherapy in the previous 4 weeks , and had not had a bilateral mastectomy . Study corre - spondence was available in English and French . The study was approved by the research ethics board of Mount Sinai Hospital and conducted in compliance with the Tri - Council Policy Statement 2 ( Government of Canada , 2018 ) and good clinical practice guidelines ( Government of Canada , 2019 ) . This report is an interim analysis with data available to July 17 , 2021 . Key partners ( education workers ’ associations , federations , unions ) advertised the study to their membership using a va - riety of media , including direct emails and / or notices in newsletters / member updates , social media , and postings on their websites . Facebook and Twitter messages were shared by the investigators and their peers . Participants were also asked to share study information with their colleagues . The advertisements took potential participants to the study ’ s webpage ( www . tibdn . ca / covid - 19 / education ) that linked them to the electronic information and consent form . After consent , participants completed an online baseline survey asking about personal , household , and work - related informa - tion and a survey asking about dates and manufacturer of COVID - 19 vaccines received . Emails were sent every second week linking participants to a survey assessing exposures and reminding them to complete surveys about COVID - 19 tests completed / respiratory illnesses experienced and to update the vaccination survey as needed . DBS kits were mailed to all participants who consented and completed the baseline survey . DBS samples were collected at enrollment , ≤ 48 h be - fore receipt of a COVID - 19 vaccine , 30 days following each dose of a vaccine , and every 13 weeks after the last sample . To encourage timely collection of the first DBS samples , participants were offered a $ 20 electronic gift card upon its receipt at the study site and results ( posi - tive / negative for antibodies ) were shared with them . Since participants were enrolled after vaccines were available to some , not all participants provided all samples ( e . g . , be - fore their first vaccination ) . DBS samples were obtained by self - collection of capillary blood with a lancet onto Whatman 903® protein saver cards which were permitted to air dry then placed in gas - impermeable bags with des - iccant and mailed to the study site . Samples were then stored at 4°C until they were sent to the laboratory where they were stored at − 80°C until processed for testing . Samples were tested at the National Microbiology Laboratory ( Winnipeg , MB ) to determine the presence of IgG antibodies to spike ( S1 ) , receptor binding domain ( RBD ) of the spike , and nucleocapsid ( NP ) SARS - CoV - 2 proteins . On the day samples were processed , samples were removed from the − 80°C freezer and thawed at room temperature for 30 min . Using the BSD robotics semi - automated DBS puncher , a 0 . 25 inch punch of dried blood that was fully saturated was punched into a 96 - well microtitre plate . The punch was eluted overnight at 4°C in 130 μ l of elution buffer ( DPBS pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 5 % BSA , 0 . 05 % Tween20 ) with shaking . Then , samples were shaken at room temperature for 30 min and the eluates were transferred to 1 . 5 ml Sarstedt® tubes . Samples were tested using the Bio - Rad Bioplex 2200 SARS - CoV - 2 IgG assay . The assay measures the relative concentration of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies to RBD , S1 , and NP in plasma samples . The Bio - Rad Bioplex 2200 SARS - CoV - 2 calibrators and controls were re - calibrated and validated to account for the lower amount of antibody in a DBS sample . To relate the values obtained from a DBS sample to those of an equivalent plasma sample , the relative value for each target was multiplied by an experimentally deter - mined factor . To convert the relative Bioplex values to concentrations , a dilution series of the World Health Organization first international standard for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 immunoglobulin ( human ) ( NIBSC code : 20 / 136 ) was run and the equation of the line was used to cal - culate the concentrations of each target . For this analy - sis , samples were considered positive for previous infec - tion if the NP and one of either the RBD or S1 levels were above the specified threshold concentration . Variables The outcome for this interim report was evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection defined as either a self - reported positive test for COVID - 19 from a respiratory sample ( PCR or rapid anti - gen ) and / or a DBS sample positive for NP and RBD or S1 anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies . Risk factor information was collected using the baseline , test / illness , and vaccination questionnaires . Baseline question - naires gathered household size and composition ; travel histo - ry ; COVID - 19 testing and exposure to people with COVID - 19 prior to enrolment ; health and demographic information ; exposure to non - household people ; personal , student , and co - worker protective practices ; occupation and years of 187 Can J Public Health ( 2022 ) 113 : 185 – 195 experience ; school size and type ( elementary , secondary , etc . ) ; and hours worked and hours of face - to - face contact with stu - dents . The test / illness questionnaire collected date and re - sult of test ( s ) , contact with people confirmed and suspected of having COVID - 19 , travel , and group activi - ties attended in the 14 days before testing / illness . Vaccination questionnaires gathered date ( s ) and manufac - turer ( s ) of vaccines received . Vaccination was defined as having received a dose of COVID - 19 vaccine ≥ 14 days before testing . Unvaccinated days at risk were computed using the number of days between March 17 , 2020 ( onset of the first wave of COVID - 19 in Ontario ) and 14 days after receipt of their second dose of vaccine or July 17 , 2021 ( date of data freeze ) . Neighbourhood risk groups , ranked by their cumulative incidence ( to March 28 , 2021 ) and grouped into deciles , were used to estimate neighbourhood risk ( ICES , 2021 ) . Region of residence was based on the first letter of Canada Post forward sortation areas ( K , east ; L , central ; M , Toronto ; N , south - west ; P , north ) . Behaviour risk scores were based on a 4 - point Likert scale for five questions about physical dis - tancing , mask - wearing , covering coughs , hand hygiene , and staying home when symptomatic . Participants who were ill or tested for COVID - 19 were asked to identify known exposures to people who had tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 within 14 days of the date of testing . Given that it was possible to be exposed to more than one person who carried the virus , data were collected separately for household child or adult , co - worker , student , friend / extended family member , or other contact . For variables other than exposure to a person with COVID - 19 , missing data were either logically imput - ed using other data points or imputed using the hot deck method ( Andridge & Little , 2010 ) . A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of imputation . Statistical analyses The crude cumulative incidence was estimated using the total number of participants with at least one positive respiratory and / or serology test . Risk factors for infection were assessed using a log - linear model ( Poisson ) with robust variance estimators . Multivariable logistic regres - sion was employed to adjust for confounding and to as - sess the impact of other variables . Effect measure modifi - cation effects were examined on the additive and multi - plicative scales . Covariates with non - linear associations were transformed or categorized . Models were assessed for goodness of fit and leverage . All analyses were con - ducted using Stata SE® version 16 . 1 ( StatCorp LLC , 2021 ) . A two - sided p - value of < 0 . 05 was considered sta - tistically significant . Results Of 2876 consenting education workers , 2834 ( 98 . 5 % ) com - pleted their baseline survey before July 17 , 2021 , and were included in this interim analysis . The mean age of participants was 45 years , 84 . 6 % were female , 2295 ( 81 % ) were teachers or principals with teaching responsibilities , and 59 % worked in an elementary school ( Table 1 ) . As of July 17 th , 2446 ( 86 . 3 % ) had received at least one dose of a COVID - 19 vac - cine and 1617 ( 57 . 1 % ) had received two doses . Overall , 1986 of 2834 ( 70 % ) participants had had at least one respiratory sample tested for COVID - 19 since the begin - ning of the pandemic ; 98 ( 3 . 5 % ) reported a positive result . Three people were positive during the 2019 / 20 school year , none tested positive over the summer break , and the remaining 95 tested positive during the 2020 / 21 school year ( see Fig . 1 ) . Rates of infection were similar by region within the province , with 2 . 1 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1 . 1 , 3 . 7 ) , 3 . 3 % ( 95 % CI 1 . 2 , 7 . 2 ) , 3 . 9 % ( 95 % CI 2 . 8 , 5 . 2 ) , 4 . 0 % ( 95 % CI 2 . 6 , 5 . 7 ) , and 4 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 3 . 1 , 6 . 6 ) of participants infected in the east , north , central , Toronto , and southwest regions , respectively ( p = 0 . 19 ) . Twenty - three of the 1252 participants for whom antibody tests were available for this interim anal - ysis were considered positive , including 5 who reported a previous negative respiratory sample test and 2 who reported no previous test for an overall incidence of 3 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 2 . 9 , 4 . 3 ) . Of the 825 participants tested using both respiratory and blood samples , 44 ( 5 . 3 % ) had evidence of infection : 16 were positive by both a respiratory sample and serology , 5 were positive by serology alone , and 23 reported a positive respira - tory test but had no detectable antibodies . In crude ( unadjusted ) analyses , the risk factors significantly associated with having had COVID - 19 include known expo - sure to a person with COVID - 19 , travel outside of the prov - ince , and having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( see Table 1 ) . As shown in Table 2 , after adjusting for vaccination status , days at risk without two doses of vaccine , and house - hold size , factors significantly associated with COVID - 19 in - fection included exposure to an adult or child living in the same household who tested positive for COVID - 19 , exposure to a student with COVID - 19 , and participant or household member who travelled out of province 14 – 21 days before the date of the participant ’ s positive COVID - 19 test . There were no substantive differences in the incidence rate ratios ( IRR ) when the analyses were restricted to the 2295 teaching staff ( teachers or principals / vice principals with teach - ing duties ) compared with the full cohort . However , when the analysis was restricted to non - teaching staff ( N = 539 ) , exposure to an infected adult household member ( adjusted IRR 11 . 6 ; 95 % CI 4 . 0 , 33 . 6 ) was the only variable that was a statistically significant variable after adjusting for exposures to other types of contacts , vaccine status , and number of housemates .

Of the 2834 participants , 677 ( 23 . 9 % ) reported being ex - posed to someone who had COVID - 19 . Of those 677 partic - ipants , 68 ( 10 . 0 % ) had a positive respiratory specimen test , 2 ( 0 . 4 % ) tested positive by blood sample only , 11 ( 16 . 2 % ) by both , and 57 ( 12 . 7 % ) were not tested by either method . Table 3 depicts the probability of COVID - 19 infection by the relationship with the person ( s ) to whom they were ex - posed . As expected , people exposed to more than one person with COVID - 19 within the previous 14 days had a higher probability of infection ( e . g . , child and adult in household ) than those exposed to only one person .

Discussion In this cohort of people working for the elementary or second - ary school systems in Ontario , the cumulative incidence of infection with SARS - CoV - 2 was 3 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 2 . 9 , 4 . 3 ) . This is similar to the 3 . 7 % cumulative rate for Ontario residents of all ages who tested positive to July 17 , 2021 ( Public Health Ontario , 2021 ) and the 4 % sero - prevalence reported for Canadians 17 – 60 years of age who donated blood in May 2021 ( Canadian Blood Services , 2021 ) . These results are not unexpected given the shift to remote learning and working from home during peak periods of the pandemic . Our results indicate that the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmis - sion was significantly higher between people living in the same household ( IRR 2 . 6 and 12 . 4 ) than between people in work ( IRR 1 . 5 and 1 . 9 ) or other social ( IRR 1 . 7 and 1 . 9 ) situations . These results concur with findings of a contact - tracing study conducted in the United States from January through March 2020 in which 24 . 5 % of known exposures were attrib - uted to a household member and 8 . 5 % within the workplace while 15 % were considered travel - related ( Ortiz et al . , 2021 ) . Similar results were reported in a contact - tracing study conduct - ed in China in which the secondary infection rate was 9 – 14 % when the case was from the same household , 3 – 8 % when it was a work colleague , and 3 – 5 % when it was another social contact ( Ng et al . , 2021 ) . These researchers determined that sharing a bedroom and speaking directly with the case for 30 min or longer were significantly associated with household transmis - sion . Being in contact with more than one case , car - pooling , and speaking directly with cases for 30 min or longer were associated with transmission in work and social situations . Similarly , a study of Chinese households showed secondary attack rates of 27 . 8 % for spouses of cases , 17 % for non - spousal adults , and 4 % for children ( Li et al . , 2020 ) . It is note - worthy that in our study , although the rate of transmission was higher within households , the fact that work exposures were more than six times as common as household exposures ( de - spite remote learning during periods of high positivity ) means that similar numbers of infections occurred in participants ex - posed to an infected student or co - worker ( N = 20 ) as to an infected household member ( N = 17 ) . Like several other studies , we found no difference in the risk of infection to education workers exposed to students of different ages . A systematic literature review found compara - ble rates of COVID - 19 illness for children attending primary and secondary school as the adult staff at those institutions ( Irfan et al . , 2021 ) . Similarly , a seroprevalence survey of ele - mentary school students in Switzerland found that 2 . 8 % tested positive for antibodies in June 2020 , with no difference by age group ( Ulyte et al . , 2021 ) . Contrary to our findings , some studies have reported that when education workers were infected at work , exposures were more likely attributed to a co - worker than to students ( Gandini et al . , 2021 ; Varma et al . , 2021 ) . In Italy , secondary cases among non - teaching staff were all attributed to contact with an infected co - worker ( i . e . , none to students ) ( Gandini et al . , 2021 ) . In our study , sub - group analyses restricted to non - teaching staff found that exposures to infected students or co - workers were not significant predictors of infection . In our study , 33 % of positive cases reported not know - ingly having been in contact with an infected person in the 14 days before their COVID - 19 test . Contact - tracing stud - ies in other countries have shown similar results , with 40 – 60 % of cases reporting no known contact with a case in Iceland , Germany , and the USA ( Ehrhardt et al . , 2020 ; Gudbjartsson et al . , 2020 ; Lash et al . , 2021 ) .

Twenty percent of the participants in our study who travelled out of province within the 14 days prior to their COVID - 19 test , or whose household members travelled within 21 days of their test , tested positive . Other studies have reported travel as a risk factor as well . The second - ary attack rate among train passengers in one study was 0 . 3 % and increased by 0 . 15 % per hour of travel with an infected person , but was as high as 3 . 5 % when seated adjacent to an infected person ( Hu et al . , 2021 ) . Authors of a contract - tracing study done in early 2020 in the USA reported that 9 . 5 % of cases were exposed due to interna - tional travel , with another 5 . 5 % exposed while travelling within the USA ( Ortiz et al . , 2021 ) . A similar study done in Iceland in March 2020 noted that early cases were largely exposed through international travel while later cases were more often exposed to infected family mem - bers ( Gudbjartsson et al . , 2020 ) . In contrast to the Icelandic study , all travel - related cases in our cohort were detected during the second and third waves of the pan - demic ( December 2020 through July 2021 ) . A strength of our study is that it was open to education workers across the entire province of Ontario , including educa - tion workers in both urban and rural locations , was available in either English or French , and questionnaires were available online or on paper , making it accessible to anyone who was interested . Our participant characteristics ( age , gender , type of school , and ethnicity ) largely reflect the teaching population of Ontario ( Ontario College of Teachers , 2020 ; Ontario Ministry of Education , 2019 ; Turner Consulting Group , 2015 ) . There were also a number of limitations . The participants are a con - venience sample representing a small proportion of all educa - tion workers . COVID - 19 testing of respiratory specimens and results were self - collected and could not be validated . The rel - atively low proportion of cases reported by testing of respirato - ry specimens that were confirmed by serology was unexpected , although it is possible that relatively intensive testing in schools may have identified milder illness in education workers , result - ing in a more rapid decline in antibody titres than have been found in other studies . There may also be information bias regarding exposure to people with COVID - 19 . Although this may be non - differential , it is more likely that participants who tested positive would recall exposure to a case than those who did not . Participants also had intimate knowledge of household members , while their knowledge of cases at school or in other social situations would be incomplete , especially early in the pandemic period when testing was not widely available . The combination of these limitations would result in a falsely ele - vated higher relative risk for those exposed to household mem - bers than for those exposed to work / social contacts . A second limitation is the possibility of recall bias as we asked that participants recall information about exposure to people with COVID - 19 up to 15 months before their enrolment in the study . Conclusion These interim results found that education workers were at similar risk of infection as other Canadian adults during the first 18 months of the pandemic and that about 40 % of infec - tions were attributable to exposure to household members , family , or friends while 35 % were associated with unknown exposure ( s ) and 24 % were associated with exposure to other educational staff and / or students . We could not detect any difference in the risk of infection by the degree of exposure to children as opposed to other workers , or in schools for children of different ages . In the coming months , there is the potential for increased risks to education workers due to the emergence of the delta and omicron variants with higher transmissibility , the return to in - person schooling in Ontario , and an increased rate of infection in unvaccinated children as public health restrictions are lifted . Potential reductions in risk may result from protection from vaccines and from the imple - mentation of transmission reduction measures in school build - ings . Despite high vaccination rates , careful attention to pro - tective practices like mask - wearing , physical distancing , hand hygiene , and cohorting is still needed in schools and other workplaces over the next months of the pandemic . Contributions to knowledge What does this study add to existing knowledge ? & People working in the education sector were equally likely to be infected with SARS - CoV - 2 as other adults in Ontario . & Although transmission did occur in the workplace , educa - tion workers were more likely to be infected by someone living in their household . What are the key implications for public health interventions , practice or policy ? & Exposure to anyone , including household members , who have COVID - 19 or have recently been exposed to some - one else with COVID - 19 is a risk for infection . & Exposure to others while travelling remains a risk for in - fection with SARS - CoV - 2 .
