In this study , atomic force microscopy is used to study supported lipid bilayers , consisting of a fluid phosphatidylcholine , sphingomyelin and cholesterol . Domains were visualized of which the morphology and size depended on the cholesterol concentration . The presence of cholesterol was found to induce bilayer coupling . At 30 mol % cholesterol , a change in percolation phase was observed , and at 50 mol % , when both fluid lipids and solid lipids are saturated with cholesterol , phase separation was still observed . In addition , we were able to directly visualize the resistance of domains against non - ionic detergent . (cid:223) 2001 Federation of European Biochemical Soci - eties .

Introduction Since biological membranes consist of many di¡erent lipids and proteins , and thus form heterogeneous mixtures , it has been speculated that lateral domains can form in biomem - branes [ 1 , 2 ] . Especially domains that consist of sphingolipids and cholesterol have received much attention lately [ 3 ^ 5 ] . Such domains are usually referred to as rafts [ 6 ] and they are believed to correspond to parts of biological membranes that are resistant to non - ionic detergent in the cold [ 7 ] . De - tergent resistant membranes ( DRMs ) [ 8 , 9 ] have indeed been found to be enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol . Eukaryotic plasma membranes consist of glycerophospho - lipids , sphingolipids and sterols . The glycerophospholipids usually have a low melting temperature ( T m ) while sphingo - lipids in biomembranes usually have a high T m . Cholesterol , the sterol present in mammalian cells , is able to induce the liquid ordered phase [ 10 , 11 ] . In this phase , lipid acyl chains are extended and tightly packed , as in the solid phase , but the lateral di¡usion is almost as high as in the £uid phase [ 12 , 13 ] . The basis of the idea that rafts exist in cell membranes is that , because sphingolipids and cholesterol preferentially interact [ 14 , 15 ] , they phase separate from glycerophospholipids in the £uid phase , and form domains in the liquid ordered phase , which are insoluble in non - ionic detergents , such as Triton X - 100 , in the cold . Liquid ordered phases have been studied in model systems with di¡erent techniques such as £uorescence quenching [ 16 , 17 ] , £uorescence polarization [ 17 , 18 ] , electron spin reso - nance [ 11 ] and £uorescence microscopy [ 13 ] . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) can image biological samples under aque - ous conditions with high resolution in three dimensions with - out the use of any probes . AFM has been successfully used to image isolated DRMs [ 19 ] , phase separated bilayers [ 20 , 21 ] and peptide ^ lipid domains in supported bilayers [ 22 , 23 ] . Also monolayers containing glycosphingolipids and cholester - ol have been imaged [ 24 ] , but so far membrane mimicking bilayers consisting of phospholipids , sphingolipids and choles - terol have not been investigated by AFM . We have , for the ¢rst time , used AFM to image bilayers consisting of a £uid glycerophospholipid , sphingomyelin ( SpM ) and varying amounts of cholesterol and directly visualized domains and their resistance against cold non - ionic detergent extraction . In addition we report on some novel ¢ndings concerning these systems . 2 . Materials and methods 1 , 2 - Dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) and egg SpM were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids ( Alabaster , AL , USA ) . Egg SpM is enriched in sphingosines with C 16 : 0 acyl chains . All lipids were s 99 % pure . Cholesterol was from Merck ( Darmstadt , Ger - many ) . For all experiments MilliQ water was used . 2 . 1 . Vesicle preparation All lipids were dissolved in chloroform / methanol ( 3 : 1 , v / v ) and subsequently mixed at predetermined ratios . The ratio of SpM and DOPC was always 1 : 1 ( mol / mol ) and cholesterol concentrations var - ied between 0 and 50 mol % of the total amount of lipid . The lipid mixtures were dried in a rotary evaporator followed by overnight storage under high vacuum . To the dried mixed ¢lms , 1 ml of 20 mM NaCl solution was added , which resulted in a lipid concentration of 1 mM . The hydrated ¢lm was freeze - thawed and sonicated in a bath sonicator ( Branson , Danbury , CT , USA ) at maximum power for at least 30 min , to obtain small unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) . Possible remaining large vesicles were spun down at 20800 U g for 1 h , at 4‡C . The supernatant containing SUVs was used for the preparation of supported bilayers . 2 . 2 . Preparation of supported bilayers The supported bilayers were prepared using the vesicle fusion meth - od . 75 W l of SUV suspension was applied onto freshly cleaved mica ( diameter 10 mm ) . The vesicles were allowed to adsorb and fuse on 0014 - 5793 / 01 / $ 20 . 00 (cid:223) 2001 Federation of European Biochemical Societies . Published by Elsevier Science B . V . All rights reserved .

Afterwards , the sample was left to cool down to room temperature at ambient conditions and subsequently rinsed . In this way bilayers were obtained suitable for scanning with AFM . Bilayers made of vesicles that were not heated , but left to adsorb for 5 h at room temperature , had the same morphology as the heated bilayers . The same holds true for bilayers made of unsonicated , multi - lamellar vesicles ( MLVs ) , but in this case the quality of the AFM images was bad , most likely due to the fact that multiple bilayers were present underneath the scanned bilayer . 2 . 3 . AFM The sample was mounted on an E - scanner , which was calibrated on a standard grid , of a Nanoscope III ( Digital Instruments , Santa Bar - bara , CA , USA ) . A quartz £ow cell was used without the O - ring . All samples were scanned with oxide sharpened tips with a spring con - stant of 0 . 06 N / m , as estimated by the manufacturer ( Digital Instru - ments ) . Scans were recorded with a scan speed of 6 lines / s and at a minimal force where the image was stable and clear , which was usu - ally smaller than 500 pN . All images shown are £attened raw data . All bilayers were imaged at room temperature . With the Nanoscope soft - ware it is possible to study cross - sections and height distributions of AFM images . We used the cross - sections to determine the height of the observed domains and the height distributions to quantify the amount of area occupied by domains . 2 . 4 . Detergent extraction Samples of DOPC / SpM ( 1 : 1 ) with 0 , 10 or 25 mol % cholesterol were , after scanning , left to cool down in the refrigerator to 4‡C for 1 h . Subsequently 50 W l of the solution on the bilayer was replaced by cold 10 % Triton X - 100 , and the sample was left to incubate for 1 min . After rinsing with 10 U 75 W l cold 20 mM NaCl solution , the sample was left to warm up to room temperature and scanned again with AFM . The exact same area that was scanned before Triton extraction could be found again by using an electron microscopy grid , glued under the mica . 2 . 5 . Di¡erential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) and thin layer chromatography ( TLC ) DSC measurements were done on MLVs of pure SpM and of SpM / DOPC ( 1 : 1 ) , with a SpM concentration of 5 mM , in a MCS ( Micro - cal Inc . , Northampton , MA , USA ) with a scan rate of 60‡C / h . TLC was performed on silica plates ( Merck ) with an eluent of chloroform / methanol / water ( 65 : 25 : 4 ) . Lipids were stained with iodine and with short heating after spraying with 10 % H 2 SO 4 . 3 . Results and discussion We have prepared supported bilayers consisting of DOPC and SpM ( 1 : 1 ) , with increasing concentrations of cholesterol , 0 ^ 50 mol % of the total amount of lipid . Of each system , several samples were made and scanned , and we show here the most representative AFM images . Occasionally , in all bi - layers , small pinholes were seen , indicating that a bilayer was indeed present , but they were always too narrow to measure the bilayer thickness [ 25 ] . In the gray - scale used to visualize height di¡erences , black is low , and white is high . Fig . 1A depicts an AFM image of a DOPC / SpM ( 1 : 1 ) bilayer , without cholesterol . This bilayer is expected to show phase separation because egg SpM has a T m of 38‡C , as mea - sured with DSC ( data not shown ) and thus is in the solid phase at room temperature . DOPC has a T m of 3 15‡C [ 14 ] and thus is in the £uid phase at room temperature . Since bilayers in the solid phase are thicker than bilayers in the £uid phase , higher domains consisting of SpM can be seen in Fig . 1A . The size of the solid domains was in the order of 10 ^ 100 nm . In Table 1 , the height di¡erence between the domains and the surrounding bilayer , and the areas of the domains , as percentages of the total amount of area , are listed for all bilayers . The average amount of area occupied by domains was 21 % of the total area , which is relatively small as compared to the amount of SpM present . However , in a DOPC / SpM mixture , the T m of SpM decreases [ 14 ] . The thermogram of mixed DOPC and SpM showed a broad phase transition peak of SpM , starting at 10‡C and ¢nishing at 30‡C ( data not shown ) , indicating that at room temperature only a fraction of SpM is in the solid phase . It is this fraction that is seen as higher domains in AFM images of such bilayers ( Fig . 1A ) , while the remaining part of the SpM is in the £uid phase , present in the surrounding bilayer , probably dissolved in DOPC . The average height di¡erence between these solid domains and the £uid bilayer is 1 nm , which is in agreement with other results obtained with AFM on phase separated £uid ^ solid bilayers [ 20 ] . Occasionally some intermediate levels , appearing 0 . 6 nm above the level of the £uid bilayer , were seen . This is illustrated in Fig . 1B , which shows an image of a DOPC / SpM ( 1 : 1 ) bilayer at higher magni¢cation . Fig . 1C depicts the cross - section of the line drawn in Fig . 1B . This indicates that some parts of the domains are asymmetric in their mono - Fig . 1 . Bilayer of DOPC / SpM ( 1 : 1 ) .

Apparently not in all domains , both mono - layers are made up of solid lipid , but some also of £uid lipid . This is clari¢ed in Fig . 1D . The chain length asymmetry in SpM has been found to cause monolayer coupling , for SpM with a di¡erence in chain length of 11 carbons [ 26 ] . Chain length di¡erences of ¢ve carbons were not su⁄cient to induce this e¡ect . In our system , where the SpM chain length di¡erence is even smaller , namely three carbons , monolayer coupling should not occur , which is supported by our data ( Fig . 1B ^ D ) Bilayers of DOPC / SpM ( 1 : 1 ) with 2 , 5 , 10 or 15 mol % cholesterol had an appearance comparable to the bilayers without cholesterol , except that the domains were slightly larger . Also , some large domains ( 500 nm ) were present that seemed to consist of coalesced smaller domains . In Fig . 2A , a bilayer containing 10 mol % cholesterol is shown with arrows denoting such ‘clusters’ of domains . The average height di¡er - ence between the domains and the surrounding £uid bilayer is slightly lower than for domains without cholesterol , while the average amount of area occupied by domains is slightly higher ( Table 1 ) . For all bilayers containing 5 mol % cholesterol or more , the intermediate levels described for the system without cholesterol ( Fig . 1 ) were never observed . This implies that cholesterol has the ability to couple monolayers in mem - branes , at least in the presence of SpM . Previous observations have suggested that in cell membranes , the rafts in the outer lea£et are coupled to the cytoplasmic lea£et , although the latter is sphingolipid poor [ 27 ] . Our ¢ndings indicate that cholesterol may play a role in this lea£et coupling .

Domains formed in such bilayers are larger in size ( up to 1 W m ) and less irregular in shape than the domains formed at lower cholesterol concentrations . The height of the domains is comparable to the height of the other domains containing cholesterol ( Table 1 ) . The average amount of area occupied by these domains is signi¢cantly higher , namely 41 % of the total area . Possibly all SpM molecules in the solid phase are saturated with cholesterol , and now also SpM , orig - inally dissolved in DOPC in the £uid phase , is incorporated in the higher domains . At 30 mol % cholesterol ( Fig . 2C ) , the amount of higher area has increased further ( Table 1 ) . The average height di¡er - ence between high and low areas decreased slightly , to 0 . 6 nm . At this point , the higher phase is in the majority and appar - ently the percolation threshold has been passed , since the higher phase is now the percolating phase . A change in per - colating phase has been proposed to be biologically functional [ 28 ] , and this is the ¢rst time such a change is visualized directly in bilayers of phospholipids , sphingolipids and choles - terol . The maximum concentration of cholesterol in lipid bilayers is 50 mol % . At this concentration bilayers showed large phase separated areas with sizes of more than 10 W m . The amount of high area could not be quanti¢ed reliably , but by eye it seemed to be about 50 % of the total area . The average height di¡erence between the two phases was found to be merely 0 . 4 nm . In these systems SpM as well as DOPC are saturated with cholesterol . Yet , still two phases can be distinguished in these systems ( Fig . 2D ) , one consisting of SpM and choles - terol , and the other of DOPC with cholesterol which appears as the lower areas . This implies that in biomembranes rich in cholesterol , such as myelin , phase separation , and thus domain formation , can occur . Cholesterol is known to thicken £uid bilayers [ 29 ] which explains the decrease in height di¡erence between the two phases to 0 . 4 nm . Since the height di¡erence at low cholesterol concentrations was 0 . 8 nm , this means that cholesterol thick - ened the £uid bilayer with 0 . 4 nm . This is in agreement with other studies , which found cholesterol to cause an increase in bilayer thickness of 0 . 4 ^ 0 . 6 nm [ 30 ] . To test whether the domains shown in this study are resis - tant to non - ionic detergent extraction in the cold , we treated several samples with Triton X - 100 at 4‡C . An example is presented in Fig . 3 . A DOPC / SpM ( 1 : 1 ) bilayer with 25 mol % cholesterol is depicted in Fig . 3A ( compare to Fig . 2B ) , before detergent extraction . Fig . 3B shows the cross - section of the line drawn in Fig . 3A , showing the height di¡erence between the domains and the surrounding bilayer . Fig . 3C depicts an image of the same area after detergent extraction , and Fig . 3D shows the cross - section of the line drawn in Fig . 3C . It is clear that after detergent extraction , the £uid phase has disappeared , reveal - ing the underlying mica substrate , and that the domains are still present . The height di¡erence between the domains and the mica was found to be 5 ^ 6 nm . This corresponds to the thickness of a solid bilayer and a layer of water between the mica and the lipid layer [ 25 ] . When the detergent extraction was performed at room tem - perature , nearly the whole bilayer had disappeared ( data not shown ) . Domains formed in bilayers with a concentration of Fig . 3 .

C : The same bilayer as in A , after treatment with Triton X - 100 at 4‡C . The domains are present , but the surrounding bilayer is dissolved . D : Cross - section of line drawn in C .

Rinia et al . / FEBS Letters 501 ( 2001 ) 92 ^ 96 95 10 mol % cholesterol were also found to be resistant to deter - gent extraction in the cold , while the surrounding £uid bilayer was not ( data not shown ) . The same was found for bilayers without cholesterol , illustrating that indeed also domains in the solid phase are detergent resistant [ 31 , 18 ] Detergent treated bilayers with varying amounts of cholesterol were col - lected and their lipid composition was checked with TLC . This showed that indeed the domains were depleted of DOPC . It has been postulated that DRMs isolated from cell mem - branes by detergent extraction in the cold may have been formed during cooling or by the detergent extraction itself [ 3 ] . The domains in our system after the detergent extraction ( Fig . 3C ) are merely slightly larger than before the detergent extraction , possibly either due to the cooling , or due to the fact that the lateral support of the surrounding £uid bilayer has disappeared , causing the domains to sag . This increase in size has caused some domains to coalesce . However , alto - gether the domains still have roughly the same size and shape . This means that detergent treatment in the cold hardly in£u - ences the cholesterol / SpM domains present in our model membranes and that any domain found after the treatment was already present before the treatment . Extrapolating this to biological membranes , domains found after detergent treat - ment of mammalian cell membranes were present as such within the membranes before the treatment . This study shows that it is possible to directly visualize SpM / cholesterol domains and their resistance to detergent us - ing AFM , illustrating the usefulness of this technique in raft studies . Also our results promise the possibility to directly visualize rafts in cell membranes in the near future . Acknowledgements : We thank L . I . van Steensel , Dr . E . Breukink and Dr . R . A .
