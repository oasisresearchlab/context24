What Does it Take for a Canadian Political Scientist to be Cited ? n E´ric Montpetit , Universite´ de Montre´al Andre ´ Blais , Universite ´ de Montre ´ al Martial Foucault , Universite´ de Montre´al Objectives . The article examines the factors that inﬂuence the frequency whereby scholarly articles published by Canadian political scientists are cited . Method . We collected data on 1 , 860 journal articles published between 1985 and 2005 by 758 Canadian political scientists and listed in the Social Science Citation Index . Using these data , we performed OLS and tobit estimations to identify factors inﬂuencing citation frequency . Results . The regressions show that the reputation of the journal in which the article is published , though important , does not explain everything . The gender of the author ( s ) , the number of authors , the geographical focus of the article , the ﬁeld , and the methodology also matter . Conclusion . An article is more likely to be widely cited if it is published in a prestigious journal , if it is written by several authors , if it applies quantitative methods , if it compares countries , and if it deals with administration and public policy or elections and political parties . Fac - ulty members who belong to larger departments and those who are women are more cited . When scholars’ books and articles are cited by others , they can be con - ﬁdent that their ideas have some impact . They can trust that these citations improve the reputation of their university and department , as well as the reputation of their subﬁeld within their department . In short , scholars have good reasons to wish for citations of their work . Therefore , investigations of citation patterns have become popular in various social science disciplines , notably economics ( Combes and Linnemer , 2003 ; Scott and Mitias , 1996 ; Laband and Piette , 1994 ; Medoff , 1989 , 2003 , 2006 ) . To our knowledge , however , such investigations do not exist yet in political science . This article proposes an investigation of the factors that inﬂuence article citations in political science . n Direct correspondance to E ´ ric Montpetit , Universite´ de Montre´al , De´partement de science politique , C .

We are grateful to three SSQ anonymous reviewers for helpful comments on an earlier version of this article . We also thank Rukmini Canape - Brunet and Bruce Hicks for excellent research assistance . We will share all data and coding information with those wishing to replicate the study . SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY , Volume 89 , Number 3 , September 2008 r 2008 by the Southwestern Social Science Association Speciﬁcally , we present the ﬁndings of a study of citations of journal articles published by political scientists who were enrolled in Canadian political science departments or policy / international relations schools in 2006 . The articles were collected from Thomson’s ISI Web of Knowledge’s Social Science Citation Index ( SSCI ) . We test a number of explanations for variations in citation frequency . We begin by proposing eight hypotheses suggesting factors whereby articles are more frequently cited . Second , we present the data set and some descriptive statistics . Lastly , we show the results of regression analyses testing our hypotheses . We conclude that the reputation of the journal matters , but that the gender of the author , the number of authors , the methodology , the geographical focus , and the disciplinary ﬁeld also have independent effects on citation frequency . Hypotheses In this section , we identify factors that are likely to inﬂuence the citation frequency of an article and propose hypotheses on the direction of their inﬂuence , mostly based on the current and limited state of knowledge on political science citation . We begin with the ﬁeld of the discipline to which an article belongs . We deﬁne ﬁelds in a nongeographical fashion . We dis - tinguish public policy and administration , political theory , international relations , elections and parties , and political sociology ( social movement ) . We do not have clear expectations about citation frequency for each of these ﬁelds , but the literature suggests that articles in international relations are likely to be more cited than those in other ﬁelds . As Giles and Garand ( 2007 ) note , international relations journals tend to have higher impact scores because articles in this ﬁeld contain more bibliographic references than in other ﬁelds . H 1 : Articles published in the ﬁeld of international relations are more frequently cited than those in the other ﬁelds . The second variable that we consider is the geographical focus of the article . We distinguish articles dealing with Canada , articles discussing one other speciﬁc country , articles that pertain to multiple countries , and , ﬁnally , articles with no geographical focus . Lees ( 2006 ) argues that single - country articles are often on parochial issues of little interest to a foreign public . In contrast , comparative articles frequently address questions arising from general theories . Therefore , comparative articles are more likely to attract a wide audience , independently of the countries they cover . Montpetit ( 2008 ) provides empirical evidence that a comparative turn is indeed occurring in Canada . H 2 : Comparative articles are cited more frequently than single - country articles . What Does it Take for a Canadian Political Scientist to be Cited ? 803 The third variable , a dummy , indicates whether an article is published in a Canadian or a foreign journal . The concern is that articles published in Canadian journals may be less cited . Canadian journals tend to be less prestigious than journals edited from the United States or the United Kingdom , the two foreign countries whose political science output is most important in quantity . In fact , most foreign journals in which Canadian political scientists publish are from those two countries ( Montpetit , 2008 ) . This variable should allow us to ﬁnd out whether and to what extent pub - lishing in Canada is a handicap . H 3 : Canadian political scientists are more likely to be cited when they publish in foreign rather than Canadian journals . The fourth variable accounts for the methodology , qualitative or quan - titative , upon which rests the article . According to Sigelman ( 2006 ) , there has been a spectacular growth of quantiﬁcation in political science , related in good part to the development of survey research . It should be noted , how - ever , that the growth of quantiﬁcation observed by Sigelman ( 2006 ) has not occurred in Canada . In fact , the proportion of quantitative articles has not signiﬁcantly changed during the period we cover in this study . Nevertheless , we expect quantitative articles to appeal to a larger political science public than qualitative articles . H 4 : Quantitative articles are cited more frequently than qualitative ones . Our ﬁfth , sixth , and seventh hypotheses are related to the nature of authorship . Miller , Tien , and Peebler ( 1996 ) argue that incentives to publish in high - quality journals are greater in larger departments . Smaller depart - ments are usually located within teaching rather than research universities . In research universities , the teaching load is often lighter , offering scholars more time to pursue their research . Therefore , it is reasonable to expect scholars located in large departments to be more successful at getting their work recognized by peers . H 5 : Articles published by members of large political science departments are cited more frequently than articles published by members of small depart - ments . Second , we distinguish single and co - authored pieces . Sigelman ( 2006 ) notes that the proportion of co - authored articles published in the American Political Science Review has been increasing ( it is now about half ) and is related to the growth of specialization and the availability of funding to support research teams . We might then expect co - authored articles to be more likely to be published in reputed journals and to be more cited . There may also be a network effect : the network of scholars enjoying a relationship with the author ( s ) of the article expands with the number of authors , thereby increasing the chances for the article to be noticed by peers . 804 Social Science Quarterly H 6 : The frequency whereby an article is cited increases with the number of authors . Third , the gender of the author ( s ) might also have an inﬂuence on citation frequency . Political scientists often complain about the marginal place female political scientists occupy in the profession . Along this line of ar - gument , it may be suggested that women are not as well integrated as men into the dominant networks of the discipline and consequently their work does not obtain as much recognition as it deserves . H 7 : Articles authored by female political scientists are less frequently cited than those authored by their male counterparts . Lastly , we expect that the reputation of the journal in which an article is published , as measured by the journal’s impact score , has an inﬂuence on citation . The impact score of a journal corresponds to the number of times the articles published in the journal are cited in the other journals indexed by SSCI , divided by the number of articles the journal publishes . If , in a given year , the journal is cited 20 times and publishes 20 articles , its impact score will thus be 1 for that year . H 8 : Articles published in journals with higher impact scores are more frequently cited than articles published in journals with lower impact scores . The impact score may be conceived as an intermediate variable . That is , male or female , members from large or small departments , international relations or public policy scholars might face different odds when it comes to publishing in high impact score journals . However , once they succeed , their articles might be cited with equal frequency . Indeed , journals with high impact scores provide high visibility to their articles , independently of their authorship , ﬁeld , geographical focus , or methodology . Data Set and Descriptive Statistics The collection of the data began with the construction of a complete list of political scientists who have faculty positions , either as assistant , associate , or full professor , in political science , public policy / administration , and in - ternational relations schools or departments in Canada . All faculty members listed on the departments’ and schools’ websites in the summer of 2006 were included in the data set . Universities that employ less than 10 political scientists were left out , as well as faculty members who had retired in 2006 . The data set comprises 758 political scientists who work in 37 departments or schools located in 32 Canadian universities . Searches were completed for every single of the 758 names of political scientists in the SSCI . Searches were for peer - reviewed articles only , thereby excluding book reviews and other material published in journals . The What Does it Take for a Canadian Political Scientist to be Cited ? 805 searches were limited to articles published between 1985 and 2005 . Cur - rently , the SSCI indexes 1 , 747 journals in all ﬁelds of the social sciences . Books and even some journals , notably those in languages other than English , are not listed in the SSCI . Despite these limitations , the SSCI provides the most comprehensive and information - rich list of political sci - ence publications ( Masuoka , Grofman , and Feld , 2007 ) . Of the 758 active political scientists , 24 percent were assistant professors in 2006 . Unsurprisingly , only 480 or 63 percent had one or more articles listed in the SSCI . Together , these 480 political scientists published 1 , 860 articles . The data were collected by a research assistant , under close super - vision , and were veriﬁed by a second person for possible errors and duplications . Table 1 provides summary statistics for each of the variables relevant to our hypotheses . Most variables are self - explanatory ; only those related to the nature of authorship deserve a few words . Articles are attributed to the department of the majority of the authors . 1 For the size of the department , we use a dummy variable , attributing the value of 1 to departments above the median size of 22 faculty members and 0 to those under this ﬁgure . 2 The gender , for co - authored pieces , is that of the majority of authors and , when there is a tie , that of the lead author . The impact scores vary signiﬁcantly from one year to the next . We use the average impact score for the period 2001 to 2005 ( Hix , 2004 ) ( see Montpetit , 2008 for a presentation of the impact scores of journals in which Canadian political scientists publish ) . On average , each article was cited 3 . 3 times . This ﬁgure appears low at ﬁrst sight , but one has to bear in mind that an article published in recent years has a lower chance of been cited . The more recent an article is , the less time it has had to be diffused among the scholarly community . On average , articles on elections and political parties , resting on a quantitative meth - odology and published in non - Canadian journals , are cited more frequently . The ﬁndings concerning the different ﬁelds are surprising . As a reminder , Hypothesis 1 predicts that articles in international relations are more fre - quently cited than those in other ﬁelds . The ﬁgures on methods and foreign journals , however , are consistent with our hypotheses . One has to bear in mind , however , that these are only descriptive statistics , which do not con - trol for other inﬂuences on citation frequency . The regression analysis pre - sented below provides a more robust test for our hypotheses . Table 2 shows the 20 most cited articles . Seven of them are authored by at least one University of Toronto faculty member and three by at least one from the Universite´ de Montre´al . Table 2 indicates that seven articles are in international relations , the largest ﬁeld for the 20 most successful articles . 1 When a tie occurs , we use the institution of the ﬁrst Canadian political scientist listed . 2 We have also performed analyses distinguishing departments on the basis of whether they had a Ph . D . program or not , and the patterns were similar . These two variables are strongly correlated . 806 Social Science Quarterly This observation is surprising in light of the summary statistics presented in Table 1 , which indicate that international relations articles are underaverage in terms of citations , but it echoes Hypothesis 1 . Again , a robust test of the hypotheses is performed in the next section . Thirteen of the most frequently cited articles address general themes rather than presenting more focused empirical research . This is the case of the most cited article , that of Colin Bennett , which provides a synthesis of the literature on the general theme of policy convergence . Only ﬁve of the 20 articles are comparative .

What Does it Take for a Canadian Political Scientist to be Cited ? 809 appears to run against Hypothesis 2 . However , just one of the articles is on Canada only and just one is on a single country other than Canada . These latter observations support Hypothesis 2 , which suggests that political sci - entists move away from single - country studies . The 20 most cited articles appeared in 15 different journals , and 10 of these 15 journals are in the top quartile in terms of impact score . The latter observation is consistent with Hypothesis 8 , but it also suggests that articles in journals with low impact scores can also be highly successful . Table 3 provides an overview of publications and citations by department . The table ranks the 20 most cited departments per capita . Some of the results deserve comment . With 246 articles and 899 citations , the University of Toronto comes ﬁrst in absolute terms with respect to both publications and citations . However , the University of Toronto has the largest political science department in Canada . Once faculty size is accounted for , the Universite´ de Montre´al becomes ﬁrst for publications and citations . In fact , with 125 articles , the professors afﬁliated with the Universite´ de Montre´al in 2006 were cited , on average , 20 . 2 times between 1985 and 2005 . This result is surprising as the Universite´ de Montre´al is a French - speaking university in which several faculty members publish in French - language venues rather than in mostly English - language SSCI - listed journals . Interestingly , some departments have a relatively low publication per faculty ratio , but obtain a high citation ratio . Trent and McGill provide illustrations of such a pattern . High citation ratios in a given department could be explained by the pres - ence of one or two leading scholars who are widely cited . To correct for such a potential bias , we calculated the citation per faculty member ratio again , but without the articles of the most cited faculty member in each depart - ment ( last column in Table 3 ) . With this ﬁgure , some smaller departments , such as Trent , McMaster , and Brock , obtain lower rankings . Conversely , the ranking of UBC and Carleton improves . Montre´al remains the leading department . Findings We present in Table 4 the results of a model relating the number of citations for each of the 1 , 860 articles to the eight variables presented in Table 1 . The model also includes a control variable , the difference between 2006 and the year of publication , in order to take into account the fact that more recent articles have had less time to be cited ( variable TIME ) . We estimate two models , one without and one with the journal’s impact score . Again , the latter can be construed as an intervening variable that mediates the effect of more distant variables like methodology or authorship char - acteristics . The ﬁrst model allows us to measure the total effect of these variables while the second model allows us to determine whether these effects can be explained by the type of journal that an article is published in . 810 Social Science Quarterly T AB L E 3 A r t i c l e s and C i t a t i on s b y C anad i an D epa r t m en t I n s t i t u t i o n F ac u l t y S i z e A r t i c l e s C i t a t i o n s A r t i c l e b y F ac u l t y C i t a t i o n b y F ac u l t y C i t / F ac u l t y ( L ea d i n g A u t h o r S u b s . ) M o n t r e ´ a l 29 125 . 33 585 . 65 4 . 32 20 . 19 14 . 11 V i c t o r i a ( t o t ) 24 70 . 37 441 . 87 2 . 93 18 . 41 11 . 83 To r o n t o 68 245 . 87 899 . 07 3 . 62 13 . 22 10 . 27 M c G ill 29 82 . 9 361 . 05 2 . 86 12 . 45 10 . 31 T r e n t 11 21 115 . 5 1 . 91 10 . 5 2 . 55 W a t e r l oo 15 62 . 25 137 . 42 4 . 15 9 . 16 4 . 02 Q u ee n ’ s ( t o t ) 25 71 . 03 223 . 17 2 . 84 8 . 93 6 . 55 S i m o n F r a s e r 21 61 . 9 178 . 9 2 . 95 8 . 52 5 . 72 U B C 31 125 . 93 260 . 47 4 . 06 8 . 40 6 . 72 C a r l e t o n ( t o t ) 53 110 . 33 400 . 5 2 . 08 7 . 56 6 . 26 M c M a s t e r 23 54 173 . 5 2 . 35 7 . 54 2 . 8 C a l g a r y 18 45 . 58 130 2 . 53 7 . 2 5 . 67 D a l h o u s i e 14 34 . 5 69 . 5 2 . 46 4 . 96 3 . 11 B r o c k 16 41 . 58 73 . 17 2 . 6 4 . 57 1 . 2 A l b e r t a 22 39 . 5 91 . 83 1 . 8 4 . 17 2 . 4 S a s k a t c h e w a n 16 17 . 25 65 . 25 1 . 08 4 . 08 1 . 16 W i nn i p e g 14 10 . 25 55 0 . 73 3 . 93 1 . 64 Y o r k 58 64 . 5 212 . 83 1 . 11 3 . 67 2 . 64 L a v a l 27 53 . 65 93 . 9 1 . 99 3 . 48 2 . 7 W il f r i d L a u r i e r 18 16 . 58 57 . 33 0 . 92 3 . 19 2 . 17 T o t 5 d e p a r t m e n t o f p o li t i ca l s c i e n ce 1 s c h oo l o f p u b li c a d m i n i s t r a t i o n a n d p o li c y 1 s c h oo l o f i n t e r n a t i o n a l r e l a t i o n s .

This equation is tested using OLS and tobit maximum likelihood estimations . The tobit estimation is technically more appropriate because 37 . 7 percent of the observations for the dependent variable are left censored at zero . However , running OLS regressions as well made us realize that results were largely similar to those obtained with tobit estimations . Therefore , we also present OLS coefﬁcients as they are more convenient to interpret . The ﬁndings with respect to ﬁelds in the discipline are surprising . Articles in international relations and political theory are less cited than those in public administration and policy ( the reference category ) . The coefﬁcients for elections and parties and political sociology are insigniﬁcant . In the case of elections and parties , however , this is only because articles in this ﬁeld are more quantitatively oriented ; and quantitative articles , as we show below , are more frequently cited than qualitative ones . Only once METHOD enters the equation does the elections and political parties dummy variable become insigniﬁcant . 3 As a reminder , Table 1 showed that articles on elections and political parties are , on average , more cited than articles in any of the other ﬁelds . The results of Table 4 are particularly unanticipated with respect to international relations . As indicated above , international relations journals have high impact scores , their articles have longer reference lists , and , therefore , we expected articles in this ﬁeld to be more widely cited . But according to our OLS regression , international relations articles have , on average , one fewer citation than articles in public administration and policy , elections , and political parties , the latter been similar to the reference category . Table 2 nevertheless indicates that some international relations articles have been extremely successful . With respect to geographical focus , the data show that articles dealing with Canadian politics ( the reference category ) are less frequently cited than those resting on a comparative approach . But the data also reveal that articles pertaining to a speciﬁc country other than Canada are no more nor less cited than articles on Canada only . The cleavage is thus between single - country articles and multi - country articles . Comparative articles , on average , have almost two additional citations over articles on Canada . This conﬁrms the results of Lees ( 2006 ) and Montpetit ( 2008 ) , who argue that a comparative turn is occurring in political science . Interestingly enough , however , the most cited articles are those with no spatial focus at all , a ﬁnding that is nevertheless consistent with the reasoning behind Hypothesis 2 . Again , if political scientists are increasingly interested in comparative work , it is pre - cisely because such work is rooted in general theoretical concerns . The results regarding differences between Canadian and non - Canadian journals are as expected in Hypothesis 3 . We ﬁnd that articles published by 3 Without METHOD in the equation , the elections and parties dummy variable has a coefﬁcient of 0 . 9 and is signiﬁcant at 0 . 05 . What Does it Take for a Canadian Political Scientist to be Cited ? 813 Canadian political scientists in non - Canadian journals are more frequently cited than those in Canadian journals . This situation is related to the fact that Canadian journals have , for the most part , low impact scores . The average impact score for Canadian journals in which political scientists have published is 0 . 225 , half the average of all journals in which Canadian political scientists have published . Therefore , the work of Canadian scholars is more likely to be noticed if they publish in foreign journals . Canadian journals may be perceived to be focused on a single country . In the context of a comparative turn , they would have a smaller audience than foreign journals , hence their lower citation frequency . As already suggested above , quantitative pieces of research are more cited than their qualitative counterparts . The difference is important , quantitative articles receiving , on average , two extra citations over qualitative pieces . As a reminder , articles in our data set are cited , on average , only three times . Moreover , only 15 percent of the articles in our data set are quantitative . If , as we suggested above , quantiﬁcation is becoming part of mainstream po - litical science , the result makes sense : an increasing number of political scientists want to cite quantitative articles , but few are published , hence their higher citation rate . Table 4 supports the hypothesis that articles published by authors be - longing to large departments are more frequently cited than those by authors coming from smaller departments . The OLS regression estimates suggest that articles whose authors are associated with a large department have one extra citation over articles from smaller departments . Nevertheless , Table 3 reminds us that some authors from smaller departments successfully chal - lenge the odds . Moreover , when the impact score of the article is taken into account , department size loses its signiﬁcance . We return to this observation below . As expected in Hypothesis 6 , co - authored articles achieve slightly more exposure than single - authored ones . This may reﬂect the increase in support granted to research teams or it may simply indicate a network effect . We have one intriguing ﬁnding concerning authorship . Everything else been equal , articles written by female authors have , on average , one extra citation over those written by males . This is not what we anticipated in Hypothesis 7 . There are many possible interpretations for this observation . It could reﬂect the recognition that women are underrepresented in the discipline and a related concern to acknowledge their contribution . Another possibility would be that discrimination occurs at an earlier stage . Following this interpretation , it would be more difﬁcult for women to join depart - ments and to publish their work . Therefore , when they succeed , their pub - lications are of higher quality and are cited more frequently . In short , an article is more likely to be widely cited if it is written by multiple authors , coming from a larger department , applying a quantitative approach to several countries , and published in a foreign journal . Surpris - ingly , however , male authors and those studying international relations tend to be less cited . 814 Social Science Quarterly These patterns may depend in good part on the kind of journals that one publishes in . Some journals are much better known and more frequently read than others and one’s work is more likely to be referred to if it is published in high impact score journals . Indeed , we ran regressions that include the impact score of the journal ; they are presented in Columns 2 and 4 of Table 4 . The impact score of a journal is by far the best predictor of citations . To what extent are the patterns uncovered earlier explained by the overall reputation of the journal ? We ﬁnd that for two variables , this is the ex - planation . Articles published in non - Canadian journals and by faculty members coming from large departments are more cited only because they are located in more prestigious journals . Once the impact score of the journal is taken into account , there remains no difference . This means that articles that Canadian political scientists publish in Canadian journals are as much noticed as those that they publish in foreign journals with similar reputation . It also means that when faculty members from small depart - ments publish in well - known journals , they are as much cited as their colleagues from large departments . Perhaps surprisingly , the reputation of a journal does not explain much else . It is not because they publish in lower impact score journals that single male authors presenting qualitative analyses of a single country and / or in the ﬁelds of political theory or international relations are less cited . It may be that this kind of work is judged to be less directly relevant to colleagues with different interests . It may also be that for this type of research books are deemed to be more important than journal articles . Our model also incorporates a control variable measuring the time between the publication date and 2006 . As expected , the older the piece of research the more frequently it is cited . Conclusion Our goal in this study has been to identify what kind of articles written by Canadian political scientists are most cited . We have looked at the 1 , 860 articles published by present faculty members in Canadian political science departments and we have examined how characteristics of the authors , of the topics and approaches , as well as of the journals affect the odds of been cited . Some of the results conﬁrm our expectations . Comparative research is more cited than country - speciﬁc studies . Articles published in foreign and more prestigious journals are more cited . Multi - author articles are more cited than single - author articles . And faculty members who belong to larger departments are more cited , also . Other ﬁndings are more surprising . Pieces by female authors are more frequently cited while those in the ﬁeld of international relations are less .
