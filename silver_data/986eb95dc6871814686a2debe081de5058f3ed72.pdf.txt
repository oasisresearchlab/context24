Journal of Data Science 11 ( 2013 ) , 143 - 155 An Inference Model for Online Media Users Narameth Nananukul Asian University Abstract : Watching videos online has become a popular activity for people around the world . To be able to manage revenue from online advertising an eﬃcient Ad server that can match advertisement to targeted users is needed . In general the users’ demographics are provided to an Ad server by an inference engine which infers users’ demographics based on a proﬁle reasoning technique . Rich media streaming through broadband networks has made signiﬁcant impact on how online television users’ proﬁles reasoning can be implemented . Compared to traditional broadcasting services such as satellite and cable , broadcasting through broadband networks enables bidirectional communication between users and content providers . In this paper , a user proﬁle reasoning technique based on a logistic regression model is introduced . The inference model takes into account genre preferences and viewing time from users in diﬀerent age / gender groups . Historical viewing data were used to train and build the model . Diﬀerent input data processing and model building strategies are discussed . Also , experimental results are provided to show how eﬀective the proposed technique is . Key words : Data processing , demographics inference , inference model , lo - gistic regression , proﬁle reasoning . 1 . Introduction With the increase in internet broadcasting and web casting services , the ability to infer users’ demographics such as gender and age group based on their historical usages is essential for eﬀective targeted group advertising and content serving services . In the past the majority of broadcasting services were unidirectional where proﬁles of customers were not available , as a result providing customized contents ( advertisement and / or programs ) to customers was not possible . With the advance in online broadcasting environments where information such as usage history and customers’ demographics are available , the ability to infer a customer proﬁle based on existing information from customers with proﬁles is crucial for providing customized services to customers . 144 An Inference Model for Online Media Users In general , an Ad server is a tool used by video publishers and advertisers to help with Ad management , campaign management and Ad traﬃcking . Typically , Ad servers maximize revenue for publishers and advertisers by ﬁrst serving the highest paying Ad then follows by the second highest paying Ad that is avail - able for each video viewer , and so on . The advertising campaign stops when the number of impressions required by the campaign is reached . Since diﬀerent ad - vertising campaigns target diﬀerent demographics’ groups of users , the ability to infer demographics information for users without proﬁle is crucial to the success of Ad serving function . The demographics inference engine could help reduce waste of impressions in the advertising system . Figure 1 shows the relationship between an Ad server and an inference engine . In Figure 1 the system collects users’ proﬁles during registration process if users decide to register themselves to the system . The proﬁles can be created by using a provided user interface screen . The information is then stored in a proﬁles database . Users can view videos through a provided video player . The videos’ contents are managed by a content server which retrieves media ﬁles from a videos’ database . The displayed advertisement is managed by an Ad server . The advertisement is selected based on the demographic of the user ( for users with proﬁles ) or the inferred demographic of the user ( for users without proﬁles ) such that the revenue is optimized . 3 retrieves media files from a videos’ database . The displayed advertisement is managed by an Ad server . The advertisement is selected based on the demographic of the user ( for users with profiles ) or the inferred demographic of the user ( for users without profiles ) such that the revenue is optimized . Figure 1 : Ad serving system for online video provider The objective of targeted online advertisement is to classify online media users into groups where each group contains customers with similar preferences . Several collaborative filtering techniques have been used to infer users ' favorite programs based on their historical usages . These techniques require profile information such as gender , job and age which can be collected through registration process .

Narameth Nananukul 145 Several collaborative ﬁltering techniques have been used to infer users’ favorite programs based on their historical usages . These techniques require proﬁle infor - mation such as gender , job and age which can be collected through registration process . With users’ historical viewing information customized advertisement and programs could be provided to customers based on their inferred favorite programs . In this paper the focus is on building an inference model for inferring online media users’ proﬁles by using logistic regression models . In general , the require - ment of the inference is to generate demographic inference information for a list of targeted demographics . For each user , the output represents a set of inferred probabilities ( IPs ) that a user be a member of targeted demographics . The data used in this paper were sampled from the data from an online media provider that provides contents 24 / 7 with 61 genres . At present , there are altogether 12 combinations of targeted demographics for online media users , 2 genders ( male and female ) , and 6 age groups ( < 18 , 18 - 24 , 25 - 34 , 35 - 44 , 45 - 54 , and 55 + ) . Users are categorized into two diﬀerent groups , known and inferred . A known user ﬁts a particular demographic proﬁle with probability 1 , while an inferred user is not known with certainty to be a member of any demographic . For inferred users , when a suﬃcient amount of viewing data is available , their demographics inference can be determined by a user proﬁle reasoning technique based on a logistic regression model . The paper is organized as follows . Section 2 presents a literature review in the areas of collaborative ﬁltering and proﬁle reasoning techniques . Section 3 introduces the logistic regression model for the inference engine . Section 4 describes input data selection and data processing . Next , Sections 5 and 6 present model selection procedures and experimental results . Finally , Section 7 provides conclusions for the paper . 2 . Literature Review Although the scope of this research is to develop an inference model for pre - dicting users’ demographics , many related works are in the area of collaborative ﬁltering . Billsus and Pazzani ( 1998 ) focused on the collaborative ﬁltering prob - lem where the users’ rating matrix is sparse . In general , similarities between users that are calculated from a sparse rating matrix are inaccurate . As a result , accu - racy of the predictions is poor . The authors proposed dimensionality reduction of a rating matrix with Singular Value Decomposition to capture the similarity in a reduced dimensional matrix . Herlocker et al . ( 1999 ) provided an algorithmic framework that enhances the accuracy of predictions from the collaborative prediction process . The data were drawn from an analysis of historical data collected from an operational movie pre - 146 An Inference Model for Online Media Users diction site . The authors developed a neighborhood - based prediction algorithm to perform automated collaborative ﬁltering by using Spearman correlation as similarity weighting measure . Kurapati et al . ( 2001 ) developed a recommen - dation system for personal televisions . The personal televisions provide users with special devices called personal video recorders ( PVRs ) . The proposed rec - ommender system that help track users’ preferences and aid users in choosing shows to record . The recommender system is a multi - agent TV recommender system that utilizes view history , preferences , and feedback information on spe - ciﬁc shows to create adaptive agents and generate program recommendations for TV viewers . Burke ( 2002 ) proposed a hybrid recommender system that com - bines knowledge - based recommendation and collaborative ﬁltering to recommend restaurants to users . The author shows that the semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge - based part of the system enhance the eﬀectiveness of collaborative ﬁltering . Miyahara and Pazzani ( 2004 ) proposed an approach to collaborating ﬁltering for web sites that recommend books , CDs and movies . Their approach is based on the simple Bayesian classiﬁer which contains two variants of the collaborative ﬁltering . One is user - based collaborative ﬁltering , which makes predictions based on the users’ similarities . The other is item - based collaborative ﬁltering which makes prediction based on the items’ similarities . They tested the model by using data from a database of movie recommendations . The empirical results show that their approaches outperform typical correlation - based collaborative ﬁltering algorithms . Yu and Zhou ( 2004 ) developed an adaptive assistance to help personalizing interesting TV content to users . The proposed adaptive assistance observes users’ viewing behaviors and updates user’s proﬁles continuously , and then provides programs recommendations for diﬀerent users according to their preferences . The novel aspect of the proposed system is that it evaluates the time it takes the system to learn new preferences after a preference is chosen . Sotelo et al . ( 2009 ) utilized semantic reasoning techniques to develop content recommendation for Digital TV and Personal Digital Recorders . In the area of consumer clustering and targeted advertising using proﬁle rea - soning technique Bozios et al . ( 2001 ) presented consumer clustering and targeted advertising in a digital TV environment . Clusters of consumers are based on de - mographics , preferences , and analysis of the consumer interactions with the TV . Consumer data from the set top box ( STB ) are periodically transferred to the server where data mining techniques are applied to match consumer behavior with existing clusters . Then , the advertisements that match consumer’s interests are displayed to consumer . Lim et al . ( 2008 ) proposed a user proﬁle reasoning method for TV viewers . Their user proﬁle reasoning is made in terms of genre preferences and TV viewing time for TV viewers in diﬀerent genders and ages . Narameth Nananukul 147 They proposed a multi - stage classiﬁer as a proﬁle reasoning algorithm . Historical viewing data from 2 , 522 users were used to build and test the system . 3 . Logistic Regression 3 . 1 Background The basic of logistic regression is based on the idea of predicting the odds of the outcome . In general the focus is on determining the odds of a user be - ing in a targeted demographic group . Let the probability for a user being in a demographic group be p . Then the odds of an outcome is : odds = ( p / ( 1 − p ) ) . ( 1 ) The logistic regression can be represented as follows : Logit ( p ) = log ( p / ( 1 − p ) ) = β 0 + β 1 x 1 + β 2 x 2 + β 3 x 3 + · · · + β k x k , ( 2 ) where x 1 , x 2 , · · · , x k represent input variables to the model and β 1 , β 2 , · · · , β k , represent the regression coeﬃcients for the input variables . Although there is a general model of logistic regression called a multinomial logistic regression model which can be used to predict the probabilities of having diﬀerent possible outcomes , predicting the inferred probability for each targeted demographic segment separately will lead to higher accuracy on prediction . The reason is because each targeted demographic segment will most likely be ﬁtted with diﬀerent set of regression coeﬃcients in order to have the highest accuracy in prediction . 3 . 2 Advantages of Model Based on Logistic Regression Logistic regression has several characteristics that are suitable for implement - ing the inference model as listed below : - For regular linear regression , the IPs could become greater than one and less than zero . Those values are inadmissible for representing probability . - Logistic function provides more realistic variance of the output , especially when there are two outcomes . In contrast to regular regression where the variance of the output is constant across values of inputs , the variance of the output from logistic function approaches zero as p approaches one or zero . 148 An Inference Model for Online Media Users 4 . Input Data The data used in the experiment were collected from an online media provider in the United States that provides contents 24 / 7 . The data were collected during a period of one month which includes weekday and weekend . 4 . 1 Input Data Selection Historical viewing data consist of several information that can be used as inputs for the regression model . For example , log data provide information on brand , genre , time of view and length of view for all contents viewed by users . A score system was used to determine what information should be selected as the regression model’s inputs . In the experiment , 5 factors were considered , they consist of genre , brand , time of day , day of week and usage level . The scores are based on viewtime percentage categorized by gender , age and the factor in consideration . For each factor the scores ( for gender and age ) represent the total amount of absolute deviation of viewtime from the weighted average of viewtime ( weighted by number of impressions ) from all factor levels . In the experiment there are 61 levels for genre ( number of genres ) , 62 levels for brand ( number of brands ) , 3 levels for time of day ( day , evening and night ) , 2 levels for day of week ( weekday and weekend ) and 3 levels for usage level ( low , medium and high ) . Table 1 reports the scores for all factors considered . Table 1 : Scores from all input factors Factors Gender Age 1 . Genre 0 . 117 0 . 071 2 . Brand 0 . 114 0 . 058 3 . Time of day 0 . 025 0 . 028 4 . Day of week 0 . 002 0 . 013 5 . Usage level 0 . 028 0 . 075 From Table 1 , genre and brand have high scores for both gender and age . Usage level has high score for age but not for gender . Time of day and day of week both have low scores for gender and age . Since the targeted segments are deﬁned by gender and age , genre and usage level were selected as input factors . Note that brand was not selected because it has a one - to - one relationship with genre . 4 . 2 Data Processing Building logistic regression model requires a training data set . The training Narameth Nananukul 149 data consist of historical viewing data from known demographic users or users with registration information . The data consist of output training data and input training data . The output training data consist of a vector of binary variables ( targeted demographic vector ) . The variable is set to 1 if the associate user belongs to the targeted demographic , set to 0 , otherwise . The input training data consist of an array of genre vectors and a usage level vector . A genre vector contains view percentages for all users . For a user genre view percentage can be determined by dividing user’s genre view time by user’s total view time . The usage level vector contains usage time from all users . To be able to weigh diﬀerent types of inputs equally the input data were standardized by encoding input vectors into 0 / 1 . Each vector is converted to a standardized vector by setting the data to 0 if data is below the “threshold” value , and converted to 1 , otherwise . The threshold for each vector was selected such that the standardized vector has the highest correlation with the targeted demographic vector . 5 . Model Selection 5 . 1 Model’s Input Variables Using too many input variables will generally cause overﬁtted issue , on the other hand using too few input variables will deteriorate model accuracy . The input variables were chosen based on their statistical signiﬁcances ( p - values ) . Those variables with p - values at least 0 . 1 ( 90 % signiﬁcant level ) were selected as model’s input variables . The logistic regression ﬁtting process was implemented by using logistic re - gression module provided by R statistical software package . By default the sta - tistical signiﬁcance of each coeﬃcient in the model is computed by using a Wald test ( Everitt and Hothorn 2006 , Chapter 6 ) . 5 . 2 Choosing Interaction Terms One of the assumptions of the logistic regression model is that each input has an independent eﬀect on the output variable . Input variables do not have interaction or joint eﬀect unless it is speciﬁed by including interaction terms into the model . In general , an interaction term represents the eﬀect of one input variable on the output variable as a function of another input variable . For example , users that love to watch both sports and action movies have more chance to be male . The pair - wise interaction terms between input variables were chosen based on AIC ( Akaike information criterion ) values . The model with the lowest AIC 150 An Inference Model for Online Media Users value was selected . AIC values were generated by using a logistic regression module provided by R . R provides a stepwise regression that takes a series of steps by either deleting a term already in the model or adding a term from a list of candidates for inclusion . Selection of terms for deletion or inclusion is based on AIC values . R deﬁnes the AIC value as 2 * ( maximized log - likelihood ) + 2 * ( number of parameters ) ( Fox 2002 , Chapters 4 and 6 ) . The procedure stops when the AIC value cannot be improved . 6 . Experimental Results In this section experimental results based on the proposed approach are pro - vided . The targeted segment ( male , age 45 - 54 ) was chosen for the experiment because it contains the most number of impressions . In this targeted group there are altogether 9862 users with registration information . 80 % of the data were used as training data while 20 % of the data were used as test data . The model accuracy is measured by the accuracy index . The detail on accuracy index cal - culation is presented next . 6 . 1 Accuracy Index The accuracy of the logistic regression model is measured by comparing the average of users’ IPs and the actual mean of users’ demographic . To be able to take into account the accuracy from diﬀerent ranges of IPs the IPs were divided into intervals where the break points are at 0 , 0 . 1 , · · · , 0 . 9 , 1 . 0 and the mean of targeted demographic . In general , we are interested in IPs that are higher than the mean of targeted demographic , as a result all brackets range below the mean of targeted demographic were removed from the calculation . Also , brackets that have less than 10 records were not deﬁned separately but were merged and redeﬁned as a new bracket . The average inferred probability and prediction error for each interval were then calculated . The accuracy index is the ratio of the weighted average of IPs and absolute prediction errors from every interval . The example in Table 2 illustrates how the accuracy index can be calculated . Note that in this example the mean of target demographic is 0 . 16 . Table 2 : Example of results from the inference model Upper Lower Avg Age Deviation # Records Range Range IPs ≥ 0 . 4 0 . 375 0 . 468 0 . 249 8 < 0 . 4 ≥ 0 . 3 0 . 414 0 . 337 0 . 188 41 < 0 . 3 ≥ 0 . 2 0 . 216 0 . 234 0 . 084 250 < 0 . 2 ≥ 0 . 16 0 . 21 0 . 177 0 . 157 328 Narameth Nananukul 151 There are 6 columns in the table where the ﬁrst two columns ( Upper Range and Lower Range ) represent the upper and lower limit of the inferred probabil - ities . The average of users’ demographics ( Avg ) and users’ IPs ( Avg IPs ) are shown in column 3 and 4 , respectively . Column 5 is the percent deviation ( absolute deviation ) of Avg IPs from Avg . The last column contains number of records in each interval . From the data the product sum of Avg IPs and # Records is 134 . 27 and the product sum of Deviation and # Records is 82 . 19 . As a result the accuracy index is 134 . 27 / 82 . 19 = 1 . 63 . 6 . 2 Comparing Results from Diﬀerent Input Formats Diﬀerent formats of input data were used to determine the best way to rep - resent input data for the inference model . The ﬁrst input data format consists of 0 / 1 encoded data for genres . The genre vector can be prepared by setting the data to 1 if user’s view time for the genre is greater than 0 , set to 0 , otherwise . This is the most basic format for representing input data . Although it is easy to implement , the result accuracy is not very good because users with similar viewing habit but diﬀerent usage levels are treated the same way . The result is shown in Table 3 . Table 3 : Result when 0 / 1 encoded - genre information is used as input data ( case 1 ) Upper Lower Avg Age Deviation # Records Range Range IPs ≥ 0 . 4 0 . 143 0 . 444 2 . 106 7 < 0 . 4 ≥ 0 . 3 0 . 37 0 . 339 0 . 084 54 < 0 . 3 ≥ 0 . 2 0 . 23 0 . 234 0 . 018 300 < 0 . 2 ≥ 0 . 16 0 . 133 0 . 178 0 . 333 345 Acc Index 1 . 1 In order to capture users’ viewing habit from the data the second input data format was introduced . In this format genre - ratio is used to create genre vectors . Genre - ratio for each user can be generated by ﬁrst calculating total view time for each genre , then divide it by total view time . Then , genre vector can be generated by setting the data to 1 if the genre - ratio for the genre is greater than a threshold , set to 0 , otherwise . The thresholds are used to distinguish between high usage users and low usage users for every genre , they were chosen such that each genre vector has the highest correlation with the targeted demographic vector . Using genre - ratio help normalize users’ genre - viewtime by their total view time . The result is summarized in Table 4 . The result shows that this method 152 An Inference Model for Online Media Users can improve about 18 percent of the accuracy index . Also , notice that on aver - age Avg IPs are higher but the result does not show signiﬁcant improvement in deviation from all brackets . This reveals the drawback of using genre - ratio data format where users with very low usage ( with random behavior ) can degrade the accuracy . Table 4 : Result when 0 / 1 encoded genre - ratio with threshold is used as input data ( case 2 ) Upper Lower Avg Age Deviation # Records Range Range IPs ≥ 0 . 4 0 . 4 0 . 507 0 . 268 5 < 0 . 4 ≥ 0 . 3 0 . 414 0 . 342 0 . 175 41 < 0 . 3 ≥ 0 . 2 0 . 21 0 . 236 0 . 121 252 < 0 . 2 ≥ 0 . 16 0 . 226 0 . 178 0 . 211 274 Acc Index 1 . 29 To be able to take into account users’ usage levels a new dimension for input data was introduced . This new dimension is called “usage level” vector . Usage level vector can be generated by setting the data to 1 if user view time is greater than a threshold , set to 0 , otherwise . The threshold that results in a usage level vector that has the highest correlation with the target demographic vector was chosen . The result in Table 5 shows that adding usage level information improves accuracy index by 26 percent . Table 5 : Result when 0 / 1 encoded genre - ratio and usage level vector with threshold are used as input data ( case 3 ) Upper Lower Avg Age Deviation # Records Range Range IPs ≥ 0 . 4 0 . 375 0 . 468 0 . 249 8 < 0 . 4 ≥ 0 . 3 0 . 414 0 . 337 0 . 188 41 < 0 . 3 ≥ 0 . 2 0 . 216 0 . 234 0 . 084 250 < 0 . 2 ≥ 0 . 16 0 . 21 0 . 177 0 . 157 328 Acc Index 1 . 63 To be able to screen out users with very low usage , users with view time less than “minimum usage threshold” were removed from training data set . Again the a minimum usage threshold was selected such that the truncated usage vector has the highest correlation with the truncated target demographic vector . The result after screening out low usage users is summarized in Table 6 . While the deviations for high inferred probability brackets ( ≥ 0 . 4 ) and [ 0 . 3 , 0 . 4 ) increase , the result shows a signiﬁcant decrease in deviations for brackets [ 0 . 2 , 0 . 3 ) and Narameth Nananukul 153 [ 0 . 16 , 0 , 2 ) . Since the number of users that falls into brackets ( ≥ 0 . 4 ) and [ 0 . 3 , 0 . 4 ) is small , the result accuracy index is improved by 180 percent . Table 6 : Result when 0 / 1 encoded genre - ratio and usage level with threshold are used as input data after removing users with low usage ( case 4 ) Upper Lower Avg Age Deviation # Records Range Range IPs ≥ 0 . 4 0 . 25 0 . 442 0 . 769 8 < 0 . 4 ≥ 0 . 3 0 . 25 0 . 337 0 . 347 44 < 0 . 3 ≥ 0 . 2 0 . 234 0 . 235 0 . 005 248 < 0 . 2 ≥ 0 . 16 0 . 182 0 . 178 0 . 019 297 Acc Index 4 . 58 Figures 2 and 3 show comparisons of average inferred probabilities and devi - ations from case 1 to case 4 . From Figure 2 notice that the Avg IPs are at the same levels for most of the ranges of IPs except for high IPs bracket ( ≥ 0 . 4 ) . The results show that the input data formats do not have signiﬁcant eﬀect on the Avg IPs . 16 Figure 1 : Comparison of average inferred probabilities from case 1 to case 4 Figure 2 : Comparison of deviations from case 1 to case 4 7 . SUMMARY In this paper an inference model based on a profile reasoning technique was proposed . The inference model is based on a logistic regression model that uses historical viewing data from users as input data . Different input data formats were considered . From the experiment it shows that using genre - ratio in combination with usage level information can help improve the inference accuracy .

Since the majority of users fall into these two brackets the result shows that the input data format does help decrease the deviations from case 2 to case 4 . 154 An Inference Model for Online Media Users 16 Figure 1 : Comparison of average inferred probabilities from case 1 to case 4 Figure 2 : Comparison of deviations from case 1 to case 4 7 .
