Until now , most formin ligands have been studied on an individual basis , leaving open the question of how multiple inputs are integrated to regulate formins in vivo .

Goode 1  Introduction Formins are a conserved family of actin assembly - promoting proteins with wide - ranging biological roles and remarkable bio - chemical properties . In mammals , there are 15 different formin genes , which play critical roles in several actin - based processes , including cell motility , intracellular transport , cytokinesis , and cell and tissue morphogenesis ( Faix and Grosse , 2006 ; Chhabra and Higgs , 2007 ) . Formins are large multidomain proteins with a modular design . The N - terminal half of formins directs their localization in cells and contributes to their regulation . The C - terminus contains unstructured proline - rich FH1 domains that recruit profilin - bound actin monomers and a dimeric do - nut - shaped FH2 domain that directly nucleates actin assembly . The FH2 domain remains processively attached to the growing barbed end of the filament , accelerating elongation in concert with the FH1 domains and profilin , and antagonizing capping protein ( Kovar , 2006 ; Goode and Eck , 2007 ; Breitsprecher and Goode , 2013 ) . Because formins have such strong effects in promoting actin assembly , their activities must be tightly controlled in vivo . This is mediated in part by several ligands with diverse effects on formin activities ( Chesarone et al . , 2010 ; Breitsprecher and Goode , 2013 ) . For instance , the F - BAR protein CIP4 / Toca - 1 binds to the FH1 domain of Dia1 to inhibit actin assembly , and the F - BAR protein SrGAP2 binds to the FH1 domain of FMNL1 to inhibit actin severing ( Mason et al . , 2011 ; Yan et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , DIP / WISH binds to the FH2 domain of Dia2 to inhibit actin assembly ( Eisenmann et al . , 2007 ) . In contrast , adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) protein and Spire bind to the C - terminal tails of formins to enhance actin nucleation ( Okada et al . , 2010 ; Breitsprecher et al . , 2012 ; Quinlan , 2013 ) , and CLIP - 170 binds to the FH2 domain of formins to further accelerate actin elongation ( Henty - Ridilla et al . , 2016 ) . In each case , these proteins have been studied individ - ually for their effects on formins , leaving a major gap in our un - derstanding of how inputs from multiple ligands are integrated to control formin activity in vivo . Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses only two formins , Bni1 and Bnr1 . Throughout the cell cycle , formins assemble linear actin cables , which serve as polarized tracks for the transport of post - Golgi secretory vesicles , organelles , and other cargoes to the growing daughter cell ( bud ; Moseley and Goode , 2006 ) . Bni1 and Bnr1 are genetically redundant and polymerize complemen - tary sets of cables that grow rapidly from the bud tip and neck , respectively , at ∼ 0 . 3 – 0 . 7 µm / s ( Evangelista et al . , 2002 ; Pruyne et al . , 2002 , 2004 ; Sagot et al . , 2002a , b ; Yang and Pon , 2002 ; © 2018 Garabedian et al .

Collaborative regulation of formins in vivo 3513 Buttery et al . , 2007 ; Yu et al . , 2011 ) . Bni1 assembles cables that fill the bud and extend into the mother cell , whereas Bnr1 is sta - bly anchored at the bud neck to septins ( Gao et al . , 2010 ; Buttery et al . , 2012 ) and assembles cables that specifically fill the mother compartment . Transport of post - Golgi secretory vesicles along cables is driven by the essential type V myosin , Myo2 , at ∼ 3 µm / s ( Schott et al . , 1999 , 2002 ) . When cable assembly is shut off by fast - acting temperature - sensitive formin mutants , secretion and cell growth arrest ( Evangelista et al . , 2002 ; Sagot et al . , 2002a ) , demonstrating that continuous polymerization of cables is es - sential for polarized cell growth . In yeast , the ability of formins to produce dynamic actin ca - bles of the appropriate length , architecture , and organization requires inputs from diverse formin - binding partners . Bud6 is a polarity factor required both for maintaining normal levels of cable assembly and facilitating microtubule capture at the bud cortex to facilitate spindle orientation ( Amberg et al . , 1997 ; Evangelista et al . , 1997 ; Segal et al . , 2000 ; Huisman et al . , 2004 ; Ten Hoopen et al . , 2012 ) . Purified Bud6 binds to actin monomers and enhances both Bni1 - and Bnr1 - mediated actin nucleation , and Bud6 interactions with formins and G - actin are critical for its in vivo functions in cable assembly ( Moseley and Goode , 2005 ; Graziano et al . , 2011 , 2013 ) . Bud14 binds to the FH2 domain of Bnr1 , displacing it from growing ends of filaments , and bud14 mutants contain overgrown cables ( Chesarone et al . , 2009 ; Eskin et al . , 2016 ) . Smy1 also binds to the FH2 domain of Bnr1 and induces pausing of actin filament elongation , controlling cable growth rates and length in vivo ( Chesarone - Cataldo et al . , 2011 ; Mohapatra et al . , 2015 ) . Interestingly , Smy1 is on secretory vesicles , and trafficked on cables to the bud neck , where vesicles pause for 1 – 3 s before moving into the bud . As such , Smy1 is a mobile inhibitor component of a cable - length – dependent neg - ative feedback loop preventing overgrowth ( Mohapatra et al . , 2015 ; Eskin et al . , 2016 ) . Hof1 is an F - BAR protein that colocalizes with Bnr1 at the bud neck and inhibits actin assembly by Bnr1 ( Graziano et al . , 2014 ) . Although each formin - binding protein has unique biochemical effects and makes a unique genetic con - tribution to maintaining normal cable structure and function , it is still not understood how these different inputs are coordinated in vivo to tune formin activity . In this study , we uncover a formin regulatory mechanism that integrates the potent inhibitory effects by Hof1 with a novel ac - tivation role for Bud6 . Hof1 localizes to the bud neck , where it has important roles in cytokinesis ( Kamei et al . , 1998 ; Vallen et al . , 2000 ; Blondel et al . , 2005 ; Nishihama et al . , 2009 ; Meitinger et al . , 2011 , 2013 ; Nkosi et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2018 ) . However , we previously showed that Hof1 also functions earlier in the cell cycle in regulating Bnr1 during polarized cell growth ( Graziano et al . , 2014 ) . We demonstrated that the C - terminal SH3 domain of Hof1 inhibits the activities of the FH1 domain of Bnr1 to tune cable organization and function . However , the effects of full - length ( FL ) Hof1 were not examined , leaving the functions of the N - terminal F - BAR domain a mystery . F - BAR domains are best known for binding membranes and sensing or stabilizing mem - brane curvature ( McDonald and Gould , 2016 ) . Indeed , a recent structural study demonstrated that Hof1’s F - BAR domain forms a crescent - shaped dimer that binds lipids in vitro ( Moravcevic et al . , 2015 ) . However , the F - BAR domain of Hof1 is not required for its localization to the bud neck in vivo ; instead , this is mediated by an adjacent coiled - coil domain ( CC2 ) that binds septins ( Oh et al . , 2013 ) . It has remained an open question what functions might be performed by Hof1’s F - BAR domain in vivo . Here , we isolate Hof1 - FL and show that it is a potent inhib - itor of Bnr1 - mediated actin nucleation ( K app ∼ 1 . 4 nM ) and that the F - BAR domain directly inhibits the FH2 domain . Using sin - gle - particle EM , we define the structure of the Hof1 – Bnr1 com - plex , revealing a unique architecture in which the tips of the F - BAR dimer appear to obstruct key actin - binding surfaces on the FH2 domain . Bud6 overcomes inhibition by Hof1 to trigger Bnr1 - mediated actin assembly in vitro , and in vivo , we find that Bud6 is on secretory vesicles , transported along cables to the neck . We propose a model in which the roles of a stationary in - hibitor ( Hof1 ) and a mobile activator ( Bud6 ) are integrated to spa - tially and temporally control formin - mediated actin assembly . Results Hof1 - FL potently inhibits Bnr1 - mediated actin assembly Previously , we defined the activities of the C - terminal half of Hof1 ( Hof1 - CT ; 350 – 669 ) and found that the SH3 domain of Hof1 binds to the FH1 domain of Bnr1 , resulting in partial inhibition of actin assembly ( Graziano et al . , 2014 ) . Further , a deletion of the C - terminal half of Hof1 ( hof1ΔCT ) caused modest defects in actin cable organization and function in vivo . However , we noted that cable defects were more pronounced in hof1Δ compared with hof1ΔCT cells , suggesting that the N - terminal half of Hof1 may contribute , directly or indirectly , to cable regulation . Here , we addressed this issue by isolating Hof1 - FL and three different fragments of the N - terminus ( NT ; F - BAR and CC2 ; Fig . 1 , A and B ) and testing their effects on C - Bnr1 ( FH1 , FH2 , and tail domains ) in bulk actin assembly assays . Hof1 - FL displayed potent , concentration - dependent inhibition of C - Bnr1 activity , with half - maximal inhibition ( of 2 nM C - Bnr1 ) at 1 . 4 nM Hof1 - FL ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . This K app was ∼ 100 - fold stronger than the K app for Hof1 - CT , which was artificially dimerized to mimic the pre - sumptive dimeric state of the FL protein ( Graziano et al . , 2014 ) . Hof1 - NT alone inhibited C - Bnr1 ( Fig . 1 D ) with reduced potency ( K app ∼ 0 . 58 µM ) compared with Hof1 - FL , and was able to inhibit the Bnr1 FH2 domain alone with similar potency ( K app ∼ 0 . 68 µM ; Fig . 1 D ) . This inhibitory effect differs from Hof1 - CT , which in - hibits Bnr1 by targeting the FH1 domains . The combination of Hof1’s F - BAR domain interacting with the FH2 domain and its SH3 domain interacting with the FH1 domain make Hof1 - FL an extremely potent inhibitor of Bnr1 . To better understand Hof1’s inhibitory effects on Bnr1 , we used total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to observe the dynamics of individual actin filaments ( Fig . 1 E ) . C - Bnr1 induced the formation of numerous filaments compared with control reactions containing actin and profilin without formin ( Fig . 1 , E and F ) , and as expected , these filaments elon - gated at an accelerated rate ( Fig . 1 G ) . Addition of Hof1 - FL blocked the nucleation effects of C - Bnr1 ( Fig . 1 , E and F ) but showed no effect on actin assembly in the absence of formin and minimal effect on the activity of C - Bni1 ( Fig . S1 ) . Hof1 - NT also inhibited Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201803164 Garabedian et al . Collaborative regulation of formins in vivo 3514 Figure 1 .

Collaborative regulation of formins in vivo 3515 C - Bnr1 nucleation activity in TIRF assays , as did the F - BAR do - main construct ( 1 – 275 ; Fig . 1 F ) . In contrast , the remaining por - tion of the NT , or CC2 domain ( 276 – 340 ) , had no effect . These results suggest that the F - BAR domain of Hof1 directly inhibits C - Bnr1 – mediated actin nucleation . Analysis of elongation rates revealed fast - growing actin filaments in TIRF reactions containing C - Bnr1 ( Fig . 1 G ) . Reac - tions containing C - Bnr1 and Hof1 - FL had many fewer filaments , consistent with inhibition of Bnr1 - mediated nucleation , but contained a small number of fast - growing filaments . This obser - vation raises the possibility that once a filament is successfully nucleated by C - Bnr1 , its accelerated elongation by C - Bnr1 is not affected by Hof1 - FL ( Fig . 1 G ) . To test this more directly , we first polymerized filaments using C - Bnr1 and profilin , at the accel - erated rate , and then flowed in Hof1 - FL or control buffer ( each including profilin and actin monomers ) . Adding Hof1 - FL to fil - aments being polymerized by C - Bnr1 did not alter their elonga - tion rates ( Fig . 1 H ) , suggesting that Hof1 specifically regulates Bnr1 - mediated nucleation . Structure of the Hof1 – Bnr1 complex To gain structural insights into Hof1 inhibition of Bnr1 , we used negative staining and single - particle EM to examine the complex formed by Hof1 - FL and C - Bnr1 . C - Bnr1 dimers alone appeared as donut - shaped structures ( Fig . 2 A ) , consistent with the FH2 crystal structure ( Xu et al . , 2004 ) . Further , Hof1 - FL dimers ( and F - BAR domain dimers ) had an elongated crescent - shaped appear - ance ( Figs . 2 A and S2 A ) , consistent with the Hof1 F - BAR crystal structure ( Moravcevic et al . , 2015 ) . When combined , Hof1 - FL and C - Bnr1 formed a novel “dumbbell” structure , ∼ 25 nm in length , with two donut - shaped densities held apart by the tips of an elongated rod ( most abundant class averages in Fig . 2 B ) . In raw EM images , we could see the N - terminal MBP tags on Hof1 - FL as globular masses in variable orientations sprouting from the elongated Hof1 - FL dimer . Therefore , these extra masses were averaged out and do not appear in the class averages . Bnr1 FH1 domains and C - terminal tails were not visible in our raw images , likely because they are unstructured and lack sufficient density ( Maiti et al . , 2012 ) . Using the random conical tilt method on 4 , 650 particles , we generated a 10 - Å resolution 3D reconstruction , into which we docked the crystal structures of the Hof1 F - BAR dimer and two FH2 dimers by an automated analysis ( Figs . 2 C and S2 D ) . The molecular architecture of the complex suggests that a sin - gle Hof1 - FL dimer binds to two C - Bnr1 dimers and that the FH2 domains contact the tips of the elongated Hof1 dimer . We also solved the structure of a lower - molecular - weight complex con - sisting of the Hof1 F - BAR domain ( 1 – 275 ) bound to two Bnr1 FH2 domains ( lacking FH1 domains or C - terminal tails ) . From 3 , 500 particles , we generated a 24 Å resolution 3D reconstruction ( Figs . 2 D and S2 B ) . This structure had an overall shape and arrange - ment similar to the higher - molecular - weight complex but with less mass , as indicated by the difference map ( Fig . S2 D ) . In the lower - molecular - weight complex , there also was greater vari - ability in the positions of the FH2 dimers , suggesting that this complex may be less rigid , possibly due to the absence of SH3 domain interactions with FH1 domains . Crystal structures of the F - BAR and FH2 domain were automatically docked into the higher - molecular - weight complex formed by Hof1 - FL and C - Bnr1 and yielded high - confidence fits ( Fig . S2 C ) . Docking indicates that the tips of the F - BAR dimer contact the FH2 domain near its linker region , which connects the two halves of the FH2 dimer ( Xu et al . , 2004 ) . This puts the F - BAR tips extremely close to key actin - binding surfaces on the FH2 domain ( Fig . 2 E ) , suggesting that the F - BAR domain obstructs actin binding to inhibit nucle - ation . In our structure of Hof1 - FL bound to C - Bnr1 , the locations of the SH3 domains are difficult to pinpoint , but based on differ - ence mapping , they may correspond to either of the two pairs of extra masses adjacent to the FH2 domains ( Fig . S2 D ) . Loss of the F - BAR domain of Hof1 results in aberrant actin cable networks We next asked how loss of the F - BAR domain of Hof1 affects actin cable assembly in vivo by integrating a deletion of the F - BAR do - main of Hof1 ( Δ2 - 275 ; or hof1ΔFBAR ) and examined cellular actin organization . Importantly , deletion of the F - BAR domain did not affect localization or levels of Hof1 at the neck ( Fig . S3 , A and B ) . A previous study showed that deletion of a larger portion of the NT ( 1 – 300 ) partially impairs neck localization ( Meitinger et al . , 2011 ) , suggesting that sequences immediately C - terminal to the F - BAR domain contribute to localization . Wild - type , hof1ΔFBAR , and hof1Δ cells were fixed and com - pared for F - actin organization using structured illumination mi - croscopy ( SIM ; Fig . 3 A ) . Deletion of HOF1 or the F - BAR domain resulted in disorganized actin cable networks in mother cells . Cable organization was quantified by SOAX ( Xu et al . , 2015 ) , an open - source program for quantitatively assessing polymer networks ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . Both hof1Δ and hof1ΔFBAR cells had higher numbers of cable segments and intersections than wild - type cells ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) , consistent with excessive cable as - sembly and entanglement ( disorganized cables that cross more frequently ) . Unfortunately , we were unable to quantify cable numbers or lengths in hof1Δ cells because of their disorganiza - tion and crossovers . Cables in the mutants were also improperly aligned with respect to the mother - bud axis compared with ca - bles in wild - type cells ( Fig . 3 C ) . We also treated cells for 10 min with the Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor CK666 to remove actin patches and thus obtain improved views of cable organization ( Fig . S3 C ; Nolen et al . , 2009 ; Burke et al . , 2014 ) . We used coefficient of variation ( CV ; or standard deviation / mean intensity ) analysis of cable staining in CK666 - treated cells as a metric for cable organi - zation in the mother compartment . Wild - type cells had a higher CV than mutants due to having fewer cables ( bright pixels ) sur - rounded by more dark background regions ( dark pixels ) . hof1Δ and hof1ΔFBAR mutants both had lower CV values , consistent with more dispersed and disorganized cables ( Fig . 3 F ) . Further , we asked whether the disorganized cables in hof1ΔF - BAR and hof1Δ cells affect secretory traffic by monitoring the movements of post - Golgi vesicles marked with GFP - Sec4 in mother cells ( Eskin et al . , 2016 ) . The paths of vesicle movements were traced in ImageJ ( representative traces in Fig . 3 G ) to mea - sure path length , and we determined path tortuosity ( i . e . , the ratio of the length of a path to the distance between its point of origin and the bud neck ) . Vesicle paths were longer ( Fig . 3 H ) Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201803164 Garabedian et al . Collaborative regulation of formins in vivo 3516 Figure 2 .

Collaborative regulation of formins in vivo 3518 and more circuitous ( Fig . 3 I ) in hof1ΔFBAR and hof1Δ cells than in wild - type cells , consistent with disorganized cable networks . However , we note that Sec4 - GFP paths are not necessarily a measure of cable length , since disorganized cables cross paths and vesicles may jump tracks during transport . Thus , while our data indicate that hof1Δ disrupts cable organization , it is unclear whether hof1Δ affects cable length . We also used live - cell imaging to determine whether hof1ΔF - BAR and hof1Δ mutations affect cable growth rates . Previously , we showed that smy1Δ causes abnormally fast cable growth rates in vivo , consistent with Smy1’s inhibitory effects on Bnr1 - medi - ated filament elongation ( Chesarone - Cataldo et al . , 2011 ; Eskin et al . , 2016 ) . Here , we found that cable growth rates were not significantly different in hof1ΔFBAR and hof1Δ cells compared with wild - type cells ( Fig . 3 J ) , consistent with our biochemical data showing that Hof1 inhibits Bnr1 - mediated nucleation and not elongation of actin filaments . These data also suggest that the defects in secretory traffic in hof1ΔFBAR and hof1Δ mutants are the result of defective cable organization rather than altered cable dynamics . Note that previously , we showed that bnr1Δ at least partially suppresses the cable defects of hof1Δ ( Graziano et al . , 2014 ) . Here , we found that bnr1Δ fails to suppress the tem - perature - sensitive growth defects of hof1Δ ( Fig . S3 D ) , suggesting that the temperature - sensitive growth defects of the hof1Δ strain arise at least in part from the loss of a different , Bnr1 - indepen - dent function of Hof1 . Hof1 inhibition of Bnr1 is overcome by Bud6 in vitro Our observations above raise an important question : how is the potent inhibition by Hof1 overcome in vivo to allow Bnr1 - medi - ated actin assembly ? We considered whether other ligands of Bnr1 may play a role , and based on available genetic and biochem - ical data , Bud6 was the best candidate . Deletion of BUD6 dra - matically reduces cable levels in vivo ( Amberg et al . , 1997 ) , and purified Bud6 serves as a nucleation - promoting factor for Bni1 and Bnr1 in vitro , enhancing nucleation ( Moseley and Goode , 2005 ; Graziano et al . , 2011 , 2013 ; Tu et al . , 2012 ; Park et al . , 2015 ) . Moreover , point mutations in Bud6 that disrupt its interactions with formins ( e . g . , bud6 - 35 ; Fig . 4 A ) and G - actin ( e . g . , bud6 - 8 ; Fig . 4 A ) each abolish its nucleation - promoting factor effects in vitro and result in cable defects similar to bud6Δ mutants in vivo ( Graziano et al . , 2011 ; Tu et al . , 2012 ) . To investigate the possible involvement of Bud6 in overcom - ing Bnr1 inhibition by Hof1 , we tested the effects of purified C - Bud6 ( 550 – 788 ) on C - Bnr1 in the presence of Hof1 - FL in TIRF assays . C - Bud6 enhanced C - Bnr1 - mediated actin nucleation ( Fig . S4 A ) , as reported previously ( Graziano et al . , 2011 ) . The actin nu - cleation activity of C - Bnr1 was suppressed by Hof1 - FL ; however , addition of C - Bud6 strongly alleviated inhibition by Hof1 - FL , triggering C - Bnr1 – mediated actin assembly ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) . To gain additional insights into this mechanism , we tested C - Bud6 - 35 and C - Bud6 - 8 polypeptides . C - Bud6 - 35 failed to reverse Hof1 inhibition , demonstrating that binding to Bnr1 is required for Bud6 to overcome Hof1 inhibition . More unexpectedly , C - Bud6 - 8 was also defective in overcoming Hof1 inhibition , albeit less so than C - Bud6 - 35 . Control TIRF reactions showed that C - Bud6 - 8 had no adverse effects on C - Bnr1 – mediated actin nucleation alone ( Fig . S4 A ) . Thus , Bud6 binding to G - actin is also important for overcoming Hof1 inhibition , although it is less crucial than Bud6 binding to Bnr1 . In addition , we asked whether C - Bud6 is capable of overcoming Bnr1 inhibition by each half of Hof1 : Hof1 - NT and Hof1 - CT ( Fig . S4 B ) . This revealed that C - Bud6 over - comes Bnr1 inhibition by Hof1 - NT , but not Hof1 - CT . Since C - Bud6 overcomes Hof1 - FL , which encompasses Hof1 - CT , these observa - tions have important implications for the regulatory mechanism ( see Discussion ) . Finally , we asked whether C - Bud6 competes with Hof1 - NT for binding to C - Bnr1 . To address this , we performed a quanti - tative visual assay , monitoring levels of soluble labeled Hof1 - NT - SNAP - 549 bound to immobilized 649 - biotin - SNAP - C - Bnr1 on beads , in the presence and absence of unlabeled C - Bud6 ( Fig . 4 , D and E ) . Our results show that C - Bud6 decreases binding of Hof1 - NT to Bnr1 , indicative of competitive binding . Genetic support for Bud6 releasing Hof1 inhibition of Bnr1 in vivo Our biochemical data suggest that BUD6 and HOF1 have antago - nistic roles in controlling Bnr1 - mediated actin assembly . To test this model in vivo , we asked whether bud6Δ can suppress cell growth or actin cable defects of hof1Δ cells . Our results show that bud6Δ partially suppresses the cell growth defects of hof1Δ cells on plates and in liquid cultures ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . Further , a comparison of F - actin organization by SIM revealed that bud6Δ suppresses the cable defects of hof1Δ ( Fig . 5 , C – E ) . Further , we treated these strains with CK666 to remove actin patches and improve the view of cable organization ( Fig . 5 C , lower panels ) , and CV measurements in mother cells ( described in Fig . 1 ) con - firmed that bud6Δ suppresses the dispersed cable phenotype of hof1Δ ( Fig . 5 F ) . Additionally , we used live - cell imaging to monitor secretory vesicle movements , as in Fig . 3 , and found that bud6Δ suppressed the increased tortuosity of vesicle paths in hof1Δ mu - tants ( Fig . 5 G ) . Live imaging of actin cable dynamics revealed no significant difference in cable extension velocities among wild - type , hof1Δ , bud6Δ , and hof1Δbud6Δ strains ( Fig . S5 A ) . Thus , the cable phenotypes in these mutants likely arise from defects in actin nucleation rather than elongation , as suggested by our biochemical results . We also asked whether cable defects in hof1Δ and suppression by bud6Δ occur at specific stages of bud development by compar - ing cable levels and organization in wild - type and mutant strains as a function of bud size ( Fig . S5 , B and C ) . Our results show that hof1Δ causes cable overgrowth and disorganization ( with bud6Δ largely suppressing these defects ) at medium - and large - budded stages , but not earlier in bud development . Collectively , these results support a model in which Hof1 plays an inhibitory role and Bud6 a stimulatory role in controlling Bnr1 - mediated cable assembly during later stages of bud growth . Bud6 localizes to secretory vesicles and is trafficked on cables to the bud neck To better understand how Bud6 activates Bnr1 - mediated cable assembly in vivo , we asked where Bud6 localizes in cells . Bnr1 and Hof1 both stably associate with septins at the bud neck , in a position to interact with each other throughout polarized growth Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201803164 Garabedian et al . Collaborative regulation of formins in vivo 3519 ( Gao et al . , 2010 ; Oh et al . , 2013 ) . Conversely , Bud6 localization has been more elusive . Bud6 was previously localized to puncta in the cytosol and to the bud neck and bud cortex ( Amberg et al . , 1997 ; Evangelista et al . , 1997 ; Jin and Amberg , 2000 ; Segal et al . , 2000 ; Delgehyr et al . , 2008 ) . The accumulation of Bud6 at polar - ity sites ( bud neck and cortex ) depends on myosin V ( Myo2 ) , and biochemical fractionation experiments have suggested that Bud6 may reside in a compartment of the secretory pathway ( Jin and Amberg , 2000 ) . However , the specific compartment has never been confirmed by microscopy . To address this , we integrated an mCherry tag at the C - terminus of Bud6 in yeast strains also carrying GFP tags on markers for different compartments : mito - Figure 4 .

Collaborative regulation of formins in vivo 3520 chondria , ER , cis - Golgi , trans - Golgi , and secretory vesicles ( Figs . 6 A and S5 D ) . Pearson’s colocalization analysis revealed strong colocalization of Bud6 - mCherry with secretory vesicles , but not other compartments ( Fig . 6 B ) . This was also evident by line - scan analysis ( yellow arrows , Fig . 6 , A and C ) , and live imaging showed that Bud6 - mCherry spots moved together with GFP - Sec4 in the cytosol ( Fig . 6 , D and E ) . Thus , Bud6 resides on secretory vesicles . We also quantified Bud6 - mCherry levels in cells at different stages of bud growth and found that they remain fairly constant ( Fig . 6 F ) . Similarly , Bnr1 - GFP levels at the neck remained steady throughout bud growth . In contrast , Hof1 - GFP levels at the neck were very low at unbudded and small - budded stages and steadily climbed during medium and large - budded stages ( Fig . 6 , G and H ) . This suggests that while Bnr1 and Bud6 are likely to func - tion together in promoting actin nucleation at all stages of bud growth , the Hof1 – Bud6 inhibition - and - relief mechanism may be engaged mainly during medium - and large - budded stages . As mentioned earlier , secretory vesicles are transported along cables to the bud neck , where they pause for 1 – 3 s before moving into the bud . Therefore , our working model is that vesicles loaded with Bud6 pause and interact with Bnr1 at the neck , overcoming Hof1 inhibition to induce cable formation . This in turn stimu - lates more vesicle traffic , establishing a positive feedback loop in which Bud6 delivery stimulates assembly of the very cable Figure 5 .

As a final test of our model , we asked how shutting off secretory vesicle trans - port using a myo2 - 66 temperature - sensitive allele ( Johnston et al . , 1991 ; Liu and Bretscher , 1992 ) affects actin cable levels . At the nonpermissive temperature ( 35°C ) , myo2 - 66 mutants showed significantly decreased cable staining compared with wild - type cells ( Fig . 7 , B and C ) , similar to bud6Δ cells , which lends sup - port to our model . Discussion In this study , we set out to understand how cells integrate multi - ple regulatory inputs to control formin - mediated actin assembly . We used S . cerevisiae as a model to study this problem , where actin cables assembled by formins grow rapidly , and yet their length and organization are tightly controlled to prevent over - growth and misdirected vesicle traffic . By combining genetics , high - resolution in vivo imaging , TIRF microscopy , and structural Figure 6 . Bud6 localizes to secretory vesicles and is transported on actin cables to the bud neck .

Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201803164 Garabedian et al . Collaborative regulation of formins in vivo 3522 EM , we uncovered a novel two - component integrated mecha - nism for controlling Bnr1 - mediated actin assembly . Specifically , this mechanism consists of a high - affinity stationary inhibitor ( Hof1 ) colocalized with Bnr1 at the neck and a mobile activator ( Bud6 ) delivered by myosin V ( Myo2 ) on actin cables . Purified Hof1 - FL was found to be a highly potent inhibitor of Bnr1 - medi - ated actin nucleation in vitro ( K app ∼ 1 . 4 nM ) . Further , we solved the structure of the Hof1 – Bnr1 complex at 10 Å resolution , reveal - ing an intriguing molecular architecture , in which the tips of an elongated Hof1 F - BAR dimer hold apart two Bnr1 FH2 domains and appear to obstruct the actin - binding surfaces of the FH2 . Combined with our previous work , these observations indicate that the potent inhibitory effects of Hof1 - FL are derived from a combination of its F - BAR domain interacting with the FH2 do - main of Bnr1 and its C - terminal SH3 domains interacting with the FH1 domains ( Graziano et al . , 2014 ) . Remarkably , Hof1 inhibition could be strongly reversed by Bud6 in vitro , and this required Bud6 interactions with Bnr1 . The Bud6 - binding site on formins is in the C - terminal tail extending from the FH2 domain ( Moseley and Goode , 2005 ) . Thus , Bud6 binding to the formin tail region relieves inhibition at the adja - cent FH2 domain . Although the structural basis for the “release” is not yet clear , Bud6 competitively displaced the F - BAR – contain - ing NT of Hof1 ( Hof1 - NT ) from Bnr1 . Interestingly , Bud6 could largely overcome inhibition of Bnr1 by Hof1 - FL or by Hof1 - NT , but not by the C - terminal SH3 domain – containing half of Hof1 ( Hof1 - CT ) . This raises an intriguing possibility , which is that after release from the formin FH2 domain , the F - BAR domain of Hof1 may in turn inactivate the SH3 domain of Hof1 . Although this model requires further investigation , it is consistent with previous studies reporting autoinhibitory interactions between the F - BAR and SH3 domains of other F - BAR proteins ( e . g . , Syn - dapin , IRSp53 , and Nervous Wreck ; Rao et al . , 2010 ; Kast et al . , 2014 ; Kelley et al . , 2015 ; Stanishneva - Konovalova et al . , 2016 ) . In vivo , we found that Bud6 is on secretory vesicles , which are transported along cables to the bud neck ; thus , Bud6 is a mobile activator of Bnr1 - mediated actin nucleation . We propose that this establishes a positive feedback loop , in which successful delivery of Bud6 to the neck reinforces Bnr1 - mediated cable assembly by overcoming Hof1 inhibition , which in turn promotes more Bud6 delivery ( Fig . 7 A ) . Interestingly , we found that Bud6 binding to G - actin is also important for alleviating formin inhibition by Hof1 . This suggests that the Bud6 activation mechanism may be sensitive to actin monomer levels in cells , pointing to another possible layer of feedback regulation . Importantly , loss of Bud6 function in vivo does not completely shut off Bnr1 - dependent Figure 7 .

Collaborative regulation of formins in vivo 3523 cable assembly , but instead diminishes cable levels . It is not cur - rently understood why the loss of cables in bud6Δ mutants is not more complete . However , one possibility is that Hof1 does not inhibit all of the Bnr1 at the neck , and another is that there are additional stimulatory inputs on Bnr1 , besides Bud6 , that help overcome Hof1 inhibition . It will be interesting to learn whether other components of the secretory vesicle itself contribute to Bnr1 activation , including the lipid membrane , since Hof1 is a lipid - binding F - BAR protein . Most F - BAR domains form cres - cent - shaped dimers , in which residues located on the concave surface bind to membranes ( Hurley , 2006 ) . Our EM structures show that the Bnr1 FH2 dimers dock at either tip of the elongated F - BAR dimer of Hof1 , where FH2 binding may not interfere with membrane binding . Thus , it will be important to determine if and how Hof1 coordinates membrane and formin binding to gov - ern cable assembly . Functional roles of the F - BAR domain of Hof1 Our results support an emerging view that F - BAR domains can have diverse functions in governing the actin cytoskeleton . As mentioned earlier , F - BARs are best known for binding mem - branes and sensing or stabilizing curvature , but they also in - teract with other cellular factors to expand their mechanistic capabilities . Our results show that the F - BAR domain of Hof1 directly inhibits the FH2 domain of Bnr1 to control actin as - sembly in vitro and in vivo . In Schizosaccharomyces pombe , the F - BAR protein Cdc15 plays a crucial role in recruiting the formin Cdc12 to the division plane to promote cytokinesis ( Carnahan and Gould , 2003 ; Willet et al . , 2015 , 2018 ) . In contrast to Hof1 , the F - BAR domain of Cdc15 binds to its formin target via a se - quence located at the NT of the formin rather than the FH2 do - main ( Carnahan and Gould , 2003 ; Willet et al . , 2015 , 2018 ) . We were unable to identify a similar F - BAR – binding motif in Bnr1 or Bni1 , consistent with there being key differences in the functions of Hof1 and Cdc15 , as previously noted ( McDonald et al . , 2016 ) . Nonetheless , these observations leave open the possibility that Imp2 , another important F - BAR domain protein at the division plane in S . pombe , uses its F - BAR and / or SH3 domains to con - trol Cdc12 activity ( McDonald et al . , 2016 ) . Still another F - BAR protein that may use a Hof1 - like mechanism to control formins is CIP4 / Toca - 1 , which in developing Drosophila melanogaster in - teracts with the formins DIA and DAAM to promote membrane extension and cellularization ( Aspenström et al . , 2006 ; Yan et al . , 2013 ) . Like Hof1 , CIP4 has been shown to inhibit DIA - mediated actin assembly through an interaction of its C - terminal SH3 do - main with the FH1 domain ( Yan et al . , 2013 ) . Our results raise the possibility that CIP4 / Toca - 1 also uses its F - BAR domain to inhibit the FH2 domain of DIA and , consistent with this view , constructs lacking the F - BAR showed diminished inhibitory effects on DIA in the aforementioned study . Implications for actin regulation in other systems Our results also broaden our understanding of the mechanisms by which formins can be regulated in vivo , demonstrating for the first time that a formin can be held inactive by one binding partner at a fixed location until the arrival of a second binding partner that alleviates inhibition and triggers actin assembly ( Fig . 7 A ) . This novel paradigm for formin regulation is predicted to provide exceptionally tight spatial and temporal control over actin assembly . It also begins to explain how inputs from multi - ple formin regulators are integrated to control actin assembly . Related mechanisms may be used in other biological settings . For example , the tumor suppressor protein APC , which collaborates with Dia and Daam1 ( and possibly other formins ) to promote actin nucleation ( Okada et al . , 2010 ; Breitsprecher et al . , 2012 ; Juanes et al . , 2017 ) is transported by kinesins along microtubules , accumulating at their plus ends , and then deposited at actin - rich cortical sites in cells ( Mimori - Kiyosue et al . , 2000 ; Jimbo et al . , 2002 ; Kita et al . , 2006 ; Ruane et al . , 2016 ) . The arrival of APC at cortical sites may trigger collaborative actin assembly with formins , in a manner related to Bud6 arrival at the bud neck triggering cable assembly . In the case of APC - Dia , actin assem - bly is hypothesized to promote further capture of microtubule plus ends at the leading edge ( Zaoui et al . , 2010 ) , and therefore may establish a positive feedback loop between microtubules and actin . APC and Bud6 may be functional homologues , as they both bind actin and formins , mediate collaborative actin nucleation , bind to the microtubule end – binding protein EB1 , and facilitate microtubule plus - end capture at cortical sites in vivo ( Segal et al . , 2002 ; Huisman et al . , 2004 ; Zaoui et al . , 2010 ; Ten Hoopen et al . , 2012 ) . Interestingly , Bud6 appears to behave more like APC in S . pombe , where it is delivered on microtubules by kinesin to the cell cortex , where it promotes formin - mediated actin as - sembly ( Martin et al . , 2007 ) . These mechanistic differences may reflect the different roles microtubules and actin play in direct - ing intracellular transport in symmetrically and asymmetrically dividing cells . Both the mammalian and yeast systems provide fertile ground for future studies aimed at dissecting microtu - bule – actin crosstalk and feedback regulation of formins involv - ing APC and / or Bud6 . Materials and methods Plasmids and yeast strains Standard methods were used for general molecular biology and S . cerevisiae work ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ; Guthrie and Fink , 1991 ) . Low - copy ( CEN ) plasmids for expressing GFP - SEC4 and COX4 - GFP in S . cerevisiae and integrating ABP140 - 3xGFP : : LEU2 have been described ( Calero et al . , 2003 ; Buttery et al . , 2007 ) . Plasmids for galactose - inducible expression in S . cerevisiae of 6His - fusions of Bnr1 FH1 - FH2 - C ( residues 757 – 1 , 375 ) and Bnr1 FH2 ( 868 – 1 , 291 ) have been described previously ( Moseley and Goode , 2005 ; Okada et al . , 2010 ; Jaiswal et al . , 2013 ) . Plasmids used for Escherichia coli expression of MBP - Hof1 NT ( 1 – 340 ) , MBP - Hof1 F - BAR ( 1 – 275 ) , and MBP - Hof1 CC2 ( 276 – 340 ) were gifts from E . Bi ( University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA ) and have been described elsewhere ( Oh et al . , 2013 ) . To construct a plasmid for expressing Hof1 - FL that has an N - terminal MBP tag and a C - terminal 6His tag , the HOF1 ORF was PCR amplified with the 6His tag encoded in the reverse primer ( forward , 5′ - ATC GCT GGA TCC ATG AGC TAC AGT TAT GAA GCT TG - 3′ ; reverse , 5′ - TTG TCA GTC GAC TCA ATT AGT GGT GGT GGT GGT GG - 3′ ) and cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of pMALc2 .

The hof1Δ : : HIS3 bud6Δ : : KAN MX6 yeast strain ( BGY3922 ) was generated by crossing hof1Δ : : HIS3 ( BGY1277 ) and bud6Δ : : KAN MX6 ( BGY1279 ) . ABP140 - 3xGFP : : LEU2 was integrated into the endogenous ABP140 locus by cutting pB1994 with NdeI and stan - dard transformation of yeast strains . HOF1 - GFP : : HIS3 ( BGY1284 ) and BNR1 - GFP : : KAN ( BGY1302 ) were generated by integration of a C - terminal GFP tag and auxotrophic marker ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ) . All yeast strains used in this study are in the Research Genetics background ( Mata , ura3Δ0 , leu2Δ0 , his3Δ1 , met15Δ0 or Matα , ura3Δ0 , leu2Δ0 , his3Δ1 , lys2Δ0 ) , with the exception of wild - type s288c ( lys2 - 801 , his3Δ200 , ura3 - 52 , leu2 - 3 , 112 , trp1 - 1 ) and myo2 - 66 mutant ( JP7B ; ade1 his3 - Δ1 leu2 - 3 , 112 trp1 - 289 ura3 - 52 ; Johnston et al . , 1991 ) . Protein purification Rabbit muscle actin was purified as previously described ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) from acetone powder made from frozen ground skeletal muscle of young rabbits ( PelFreez ) . Lyophilized acetone powder stored at −80°C was mechanically sheered in a coffee grinder , resuspended in G - buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ) . Actin was then cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 50 , 000 × g . Actin was polymerized by addition of 2 mM MgCl 2 and 50 mM NaCl and in - cubated overnight at 4°C . F - Actin was pelleted by centrifugation for 150 min at 361 , 000 × g . The F - actin pellet was solubilized by Dounce homogenization and dialyzed against G - buffer for 48 h at 4°C to depolymerize the actin . The G - actin was then precleared at 435 , 000 × g and gel filtered on an S200 ( 16 / 60 ) column ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated in G - buffer . Peak actin - containing fractions were stored at 4°C and used within 2 wk . To label actin with either Biotin or Oregon Green ( OG ) dye on cysteine 374 , an F - actin pellet was dounced and dialyzed against G - buffer lack - ing DTT . Then the G - actin was polymerized by adding an equal volume of 2× labeling buffer ( 50 mM Imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM KCl , 0 . 3 mM ATP , and 4 mM MgCl 2 ) . After 5 - min incubation at 25°C , actin was mixed with a fivefold molar excess of either NHS - XX - Biotin ( Merck KGaA ) or OG - 488 iodoacetamide ( Invit - rogen ) , resuspended in anhydrous dimethylformamide , and in - cubated in the dark for 15 h at 4°C . Labeled F - actin was pelleted as above , and the pellet was rinsed with G - buffer , depolymerized by Dounce homogenization , and dialyzed against G - buffer for 48 h at 4°C . Labeled , monomeric actin was then applied to an S200 ( 16 / 60 ) gel filtration column as above . For biotin - actin , peak fractions were aliquoted , snap frozen in liquid N 2 , and stored at −80°C . For OG - actin , peak fractions were dialyzed for 15 h against G - buffer with 50 % glycerol and stored at −20°C . To label actin with pyrenyl - iodoacetamide on cysteine 374 ( Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ; Graziano et al . , 2013 ) , an F - actin pellet prepared as above was dialyzed against pyrene buffer ( 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM KCl , 0 . 3 mM ATP , and 2 mM MgSO 4 ) for 4 h and then diluted with pyrene buffer to 1 mg / ml ( 23 . 8 µM ) . A 10 - fold molar excess of pyrenyl - iodoacetamide was added , and the actin solution was incubated overnight at 4°C . The reaction was then centrifuged for 3 h at 4°C at 40 , 000 rpm in a Ti60 rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) to pellet the F - actin . F - actin pellets were dounced and then dialyzed against G - buffer for 48 h to depolymerize the actin . The G - actin was fractionated on a S200 ( 16 / 60 ) column equil - ibrated in G - buffer , and peak fractions were pooled , aliquoted , snap frozen in liquid N 2 , and stored at −80°C . S . cerevisiae profilin ( Pfy1 ) was expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) E . coli and purified as described previously ( Graziano et al . , 2013 ) . Bacterial cells were grown in terrific broth to log phase and in - duced with 0 . 4 mM IPTG for 3 – 4 h at 37°C . Cells were pelleted and stored at −80°C . Frozen pellets were thawed , resuspended in lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail ( 1 mM PMSF and 0 . 5 µM each of pep - statin A , antipain , leupeptin , aprotinin , and chymostatin ) , and lysed by incubation with lysozyme and sonication . Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 80 , 000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min in a TLA - 100 . 3 rotor ( Beckman Coulter ) . The supernatant was then loaded on a 5 ml HiTrap Q fast flow column ( GE Healthcare ) and eluted with a 75 ml salt gradient ( 0 – 400 mM NaCl ) in 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 . Peak fractions were pooled , concentrated to a total volume of 5 ml and then fractionated on a Superdex ( 26 / 60 ) gel filtration column ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated in G - buffer . Peak fractions were pooled , aliquoted , snap frozen in liquid N 2 , and stored at −80°C . C - Bnr1 , Bnr1 FH2 polypeptides were expressed as N - termi - nal 6His - fusions in S . cerevisiae strain BJ2168 from high - copy plasmids under the control of a galactose - inducible promoter ( Moseley et al . , 2006 ) . For each purification , 2 liters of yeast cells were grown in synthetic medium lacking uracil with 2 % raffinose to an OD 600 of 0 . 6 – 0 . 9 . Then , expression was induced by addition of dry ingredients ( 10 g yeast extract , 20 g peptone , and galactose ; 2 % wt / vol ) . Cells were grown for 12 – 16 h at 30°C and then pelleted , washed in H 2 O , frozen in liquid N 2 , and stored at −80°C . Yeast was lysed mechanically in a coffee grinder cooled with liquid N 2 . Then , 20 g of lysed yeast powder was resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A ( 20 mM NaPO 4 , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 30 mM imidazole , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and 1 % NP - 40 ) supplemented with prote - Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201803164 Garabedian et al .

Supernatants were harvested , passed through a 0 . 45 - µm syringe filter , and then incubated with 0 . 5 ml Ni – NTA beads for 1 h at 4°C . Beads were washed five times with Buffer B ( Buffer A lacking protease inhibitors and NP - 40 ) . SNAP - C - Bnr1 was labeled while still on the beads by incubation overnight at 4°C with a fivefold molar excess of BG - 649 - PEG - Biotin and then washed with Buffer B and eluted with Buffer B supplemented with 300 mM imidazole . Eluted SNAP - C - Bnr1 was purified further on a Superose 12 gel filtration column ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated in HEKG 10 D . Peak fractions were snap frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at −80°C . MBP - Hof1 polypeptides ( F - BAR , NT , and CC2 ) were expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) E . coli cells carrying the pRARE plasmid ( Milli - poreSigma ) . Cells were grown to late log phase ( OD 600 of 0 . 7 – 0 . 9 ) in terrific broth supplemented with ampicillin and chloram - phenicol to maintain selection of the expression plasmid and the pRARE plasmid , respectively . Expression was induced with 0 . 4 mM IPTG overnight at 18°C , and then cells were pelleted and stored at −80°C . Cell pellets were thawed , resuspended in lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , and 400 mM NaCl ) with the same protease inhibitor cocktail as above , and lysed by treatment with lysozyme and sonication . Lysates were cleared by centrifu - gation at 13 , 000 rpm for 20 min in an F21S - 8×50y rotor ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , and the supernatant was mixed with 0 . 5 ml of amylose beads ( New England Biolabs ) and rotated at 4°C for 1 h . The beads were then washed five times with 5 ml lysis buf - fer . Hof1 constructs were eluted with lysis buffer plus 20 mM maltose and 1 mM DTT . Finally , eluted protein was exchanged into HEKG 10 D using a PD10 desalting column ( GE Life Sciences ) and collected in 0 . 3 - ml fractions . Peak fractions were aliquoted and snap frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at −80°C . MBP - Hof1 - NT - SNAP was expressed and purified similarly , except that peak fractions eluted from the amylose beads were incubated with a fivefold molar excess of BG - 549 SNAP dye overnight at 4°C . The protein was then exchanged into HEKG 10 D on a PD10 desalting column as above , collecting 0 . 3 - ml fractions . Peak fractions were snap frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at −80°C . MBP - Hof1 - FL - 6His was expressed , stored , lysed , and cleared as above , and then the supernatant was mixed with 0 . 5 ml Ni - NTA beads and incubated at 4°C for 1 h . The beads were then washed five times with 5 ml lysis buffer plus 50 mM imidazole . MBP - Hof1 - FL - 6His was eluted with lysis buffer plus 300 mM im - idazole in 0 . 5 - ml fractions . Eluted proteins were diluted fourfold with buffer lacking imidazole and then mixed with 0 . 5 ml amy - lose beads and incubated at 4°C for 1 h . The beads were washed five times with 5 ml lysis buffer , and then the Hof1 polypeptide was eluted with lysis buffer plus 20 mM maltose and 1 mM DTT . Finally , the eluted protein was exchanged into HEKG 10 D using a PD10 desalting column ( GE Life Sciences ) and collected in 0 . 3 - ml fractions . Peak fractions were snap frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at −80°C . For EM experiments , all proteins were purified as above except the final desalting buffer was HEKD ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM KCl , and 1 mM DTT ) supple - mented with 150 mM NaCl . GST - Hof1 - CT - 6His was expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) E . coli cells carrying the pRARE plasmid . Cells were grown to OD 600 of 0 . 7 – 0 . 9 in terrific broth supplemented with kanamycin and chlor - amphenicol . Expression was induced and cells were pelleted , washed , lysed , and centrifuged as above for other Hof1 polypep - tides . The supernatant was mixed with 0 . 5 ml Ni - NTA beads and incubated at 4°C for 1 h Beads were washed five times with 5 ml lysis buffer plus 50 mM imidazole , and then GST - Hof1 - CT - 6His was eluted using lysis buffer plus 300 mM imidazole , collecting 0 . 5 - ml fractions . Peak fractions were pooled , diluted fourfold with buffer lacking imidazole , mixed with 0 . 5 ml glutathione agarose beads ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , and incubated at 4°C for 1 h . Beads were washed five times with 5 ml lysis buffer , and then GST - Hof1 - CT - 6His was eluted using lysis buffer plus 30 mM glutathione and 1 mM DTT . The eluted protein was exchanged into HEKG 10 D buffer on a PD10 desalting column ( GE Life Sci - ences ) , aliquoted , snap frozen in liquid N 2 , and stored at −80°C . GST - C - Bud6 ( 550 – 788 ) was expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) cells and purified as described previously ( Graziano et al . , 2013 ) . Cells were grown in terrific broth to late log phase , induced using 0 . 4 mM IPTG overnight at 18°C , and then pelleted and frozen at −80°C . Pellets were thawed , resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 1 . 5 % sarkosyl , and 5 mM DTT ) supplemented with protease inhibitors as above , and lysed with lysozyme and sonication . Cell lysates were cleared by centrifu - gation at 13 , 000 rpm for 20 min in a Sorvall S600 rotor ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Triton X - 100 ( final concentration 3 . 3 % [ vol / vol ] ) was added to the supernatant , which then was mixed with 1 ml preswollen glutathione agarose in PBS ( 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 4 . 3 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 1 . 47 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) . After incu - bation at 4°C for 1 h , beads were washed four times with PBS and then twice with HEKD . C - Bud6 polypeptides were cleaved from GST by digestion with TEV protease for 2 h at room temperature , aliquoted , and snap frozen . Bulk actin assembly assays Kinetics of pyrene - actin assembly were measured as described ( Graziano et al . , 2014 ) . Actin assembly reactions were performed in a final volume of 60 µl , using 2 µM G - actin ( 5 % pyrene labeled ) . 38 µl of G - actin was converted to Mg 2 + - ATP - actin ∼ 2 min at am - bient temperature before use by mixing with 4 µl of exchange buffer ( 10 mM EDTA and 1 mM MgCl 2 ) . Then , 15 µl of proteins Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201803164 Garabedian et al . Collaborative regulation of formins in vivo 3526 and / or control buffer ( HEKG 10 ) was added , and finally 3 µl of 20× initiation mix ( 40 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM ATP , and 1 M KCl ) was added to initiate actin polymerization . Fluorescence was monitored at excitation 365 nm and emission 407 nm in a spectrophotome - ter at ambient temperature ( Photon Technology International ) . Rates of pyrene - actin assembly were determined from the slopes of the curves where they reached 50 % maximum polymeriza - tion . To plot concentration - dependent activities of each Bnr1 polypeptide , the assembly rate of Bnr1 alone ( without Hof1 ) was arbitrarily set to 1 . 0 ( Fig . 1 D ) . The concentration of each Hof1 polypeptide required for half - maximal inhibition ( K app ) of Bnr1 activity was determined by fitting a hyperbolic decay curve to the data in GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software ) . TIRF microscopy For TIRF microscopy experiments , 24 × 60 - mm coverslips ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) were cleaned by sonication in deter - gent for 60 min and rinsed thoroughly in sterile water , followed by sonication in 1 M KOH for 20 min and 1 M HCl for 20 min and finally sonication in ethanol for 60 min . Coverslips were then washed extensively with sterile water , dried in an N 2 stream , and coated with 200 µl of 80 % ethanol , pH 2 . 0 , 2 mg / ml me - thoxy - poly ( ethylene glycol ) - silane , and 2 µg / ml biotin - poly ( eth - ylene glycol ) - silane ( Laysan Bio Inc . ) . Coverslips were incubated at 70°C for 1 – 3 d before use . Flow cells were assembled just before imaging by rinsing coverslips extensively with sterile water , at - taching coverslips to a plastic flow chamber ( Ibidi ) using dou - ble - sided tape 2 . 5 cm × 2 mm × 120 µm ( Grace Bio - Labs ) , and sealing both ends with epoxy resin ( Devcon ) . Immediately before each experiment , flow cells were incu - bated for 30 s with HBSA ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM KCl , and 1 % BSA ) , incubated for 60 s in 0 . 1 mg / ml strepta - vidin in HEKG 10 , and then washed with TIRF buffer ( 10 mM imid - azole , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 10 mM DTT , 15 mM glucose , 20 µg / ml glucose oxidase , and 0 . 5 % methyl - cellulose [ 4 , 000 cP ] , pH 7 . 4 ) . Proteins in TIRF buffer were mixed with 0 . 5 µM G - actin ( 10 % OG labeled , 0 . 5 % biotin labeled ) and then flowed into the chamber . Images were acquired in ambient temperature at 10 - s intervals for 600 s using an inverted Ti200 TIRF microscope ( Nikon Instruments ) equipped with 100 - mW solid - state lasers ( Agilent Technologies ) , a CFI Apo 60× TIRF ob - jective ( NA 1 . 49 ; Nikon Instruments ) , and an iXon EMC CD cam - era ( Andor Technology ) . Focus was maintained using the Perfect Focus System ( Nikon Instruments ) . The number of actin fila - ments in each field of view ( FOV ) was measured 600 s after initi - ation of assembly and the rate of fluorescence accumulation was measured from the slope of fluorescence over time using ImageJ . TIRF microscopy was also used to directly visualize bind - ing of labeled MBP - Hof1 - NT - SNAP - 549 to labeled 649 - bio - tin - SNAP - C - Bnr1 immobilized on beads in the presence and absence of unlabeled C - Bud6 ( Fig . 4 , D and E ) . For these assays , 24 × 60 - mm coverslips ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) were cleaned as above and coated with 200 µl of 80 % ethanol , pH 2 . 0 , 4 mg / ml methoxy - poly ( ethylene glycol ) - silane , and 80 µg / ml bio - tin - poly ( ethylene glycol ) - silane ( Laysan Bio Inc . ) . Coverslips were incubated at 70°C for 1 – 3 d before use . Flow cells were as - sembled as described for TIRF assays above . Immediately before imaging , 60 µg of 2 µm biotinylated polystyrene microspheres ( Polysciences Inc . ) were washed three times in Buffer A ( 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM EGTA ) . The microspheres were then incubated in 600 µl of Buffer A with 4 µg / ml streptavidin ( 2 . 4 µg ) and 300 ng of 649 - biotin - SNAP - C - Bnr1 for 20 min on ice to allow formin binding to the beads . After this incubation period , the formin - coated beads were washed three times in Buffer A to remove any unbound formin and then resuspended in 50 µl of Buffer A . Immediately before each TIRF reaction , 5 µl of formin - coated beads was diluted 10 - fold into Buffer A ( 50 µl total ) and incubated for 10 min in a TIRF flow cell at ambient temperature to allow beads to settle . Then , 50 µl of HEK buffer supplemented with 1 % BSA was flowed into the cell to block nonspecific binding sites , followed by HEK buffer and then TIRF buffer ( 10 mM imidazole , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 10 mM DTT , 15 mM glucose , 20 µg / ml glucose oxidase , and 3 % Dextran ) containing 500 nM Hof1 - NT - SNAP - 549 with or without 200 nM C - Bud6 . After a 10 - min in - cubation period , images were captured at ambient temperature using an inverted Ti200 TIRF microscope equipped with 100 - mW solid - state lasers ( Agilent Technologies ) , a CFI Apo 60× TIRF objective , and an EMC CD camera ( Andor Technology ) . Focus was maintained using the Perfect Focus System . Live - cell imaging and analysis For measuring in vivo actin cable elongation rates , yeast cells ex - pressing Abp140 - 3xGFP from the endogenous locus were grown to mid - log phase ( OD 600 0 . 4 – 0 . 6 ) in synthetic media . Live cells in media were mounted on slides with coverslips and immediately imaged at ambient temperature on an i - E upright confocal mi - croscope ( Nikon Instruments ) equipped with a CSU - W1 spinning disk head ( Yokogawa ) , 100× oil objective ( NA 1 . 4 ; Nikon Instru - ments ) , and an Ixon 897 Ultra - CCD camera ( Andor Technology ) controlled by NIS - Elements software ( Nikon Instruments ) . Actin cables were analyzed in a single optical plane , capturing images 120 s . Individual cells were cropped using ImageJ . Actin cable extension speeds were measured using custom software written in MAT LAB ( MathWorks ; Eskin et al . , 2016 ) . For imaging secre - tory vesicle transport , wild - type and mutant yeast strains were transformed with a CEN plasmid expressing GFP - Sec4 ( Calero et al . , 2003 ) . Cells were grown to mid - log phase ( OD 600 0 . 4 – 0 . 6 ) in synthetic selective media , then mounted on a microscope slide and imaged at ambient temperature on an inverted Ti200 mi - croscope equipped with an Intensilight excitation source ( Nikon Instruments ) , 100× objective ( NA 1 . 30 ; Nikon Instruments ) , 1 . 5× magnifier , and iXon EMC CD camera . Focus was maintained using the Perfect Focus System . Movies were analyzed in ImageJ as fol - lows . Secretory vesicle movements were monitored within the mother cells of each strain by manually tracking the positions over time for 5 – 10 puncta ( GFP - Sec4 ) in each of 10 or more cells . Tortuosity measurements were made by dividing the length of the path ( from the initial point of movement to the bud neck ) by the distance between the point of origin and the bud neck . For measuring Pearson’s correlation for colocalization of Bud6 - mCherry and / or GFP - tagged membrane markers ( described previously ) , yeast cells were grown to mid - log phase in synthetic selective media , mounted on slides with coverslips , and immedi - Journal of Cell Biology https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201803164 Garabedian et al . Collaborative regulation of formins in vivo 3527 ately imaged at ambient temperature on an i - E upright confocal microscope equipped with a CSU - W1 spinning disk head , 100× oil objective ( NA 1 . 4 ; Nikon Instruments ) , and an Ixon 897 Ul - tra - CCD camera controlled by NIS - Elements software . Individ - ual cells from each strain were cropped , background removed by subtracting the mean fluorescence in each channel , and colocal - ization was analyzed by the Coloc2 plugin in ImageJ . Density of Bud6 - mCherry staining in cells at different stages of bud growth ( Fig . 6 F ) was determined by live imaging on an i - E confocal microscope as above . The outlines of individual cells were traced in ImageJ , and total fluorescence in each cell was measured and then divided by cell area . To quantify levels of Hof1 - GFP and Bnr1 - GFP at the neck , cells were grown in syn - thetic media to log phase as above . Then , cells were exposed to 1 µM α - factor ( United Biochemical Research Inc . ) for 3 h to syn - chronize cultures ( as unbudded cells ) . Cells were then released from α factor by washing three times in 5 ml synthetic media and resuspended in 100 µl synthetic media . 3 – 5 µl of this culture was mounted on top of an agarose plug ( synthetic media plus 0 . 7 % agarose ) on a glass slide . A coverslip was placed on top of the agarose plug and sealed with nail polish . Cells were imaged every 10 min using FITC LED light on a Ti - 2 SIM - E inverted mi - croscope with a Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4 . 0 camera controlled by NIS - Elements software . Fixed - cell imaging and analysis Yeast cells were grown to mid - log phase ( OD 600 0 . 4 – 0 . 6 ) in YEPD media , then fixed in 4 . 7 % formaldehyde for 45 min , and washed three times with PBS . Cells were stained overnight with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin ( Life Technologies ) and then washed twice with PBS . For experiments in which actin patches were removed , cells were treated with 100 µM CK666 for 10 – 15 min at 25°C be - fore fixation . For comparing actin cable levels in myo2 - 66 and wild - type cells at elevated temperature , cells were grown to mid - log phase as above and then shifted to 35°C for 5 min , fixed , and stained for F - actin as above . Fixed cells were imaged in PBS at am - bient temperature by SIM on a Ti - 2 SIM - E inverted microscope with a 100× oil objective ( NA 1 . 49 ) , and Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4 . 0 camera controlled by NIS - Elements software . From SIM im - ages , individual cells were cropped , background was subtracted from maximum intensity images in ImageJ , and actin cables were analyzed using an open source program for biopolymer networks , SOAX ( Xu et al . , 2015 ) . For all SOAX analyses , default settings were used , with two exceptions , to optimize detection of cables : R - threshold value was set to 0 . 005 and k - stretch factor was set to 1 . 0 . The number of actin cable segments and inter - sections , as well as cable orientation maps ( relative to the moth - er - bud axis ) , was automatically generated . For CV analysis and quantification of actin cable levels in the bud relative to total cel - lular levels , cables were imaged by confocal microscopy , enabling a larger number of cells to be analyzed . Confocal imaging was performed on an i - E upright microscope equipped with a CSU - W1 spinning disk head , 100× oil objective ( NA 1 . 4 ) and an Ixon 897 Ultra - CCD camera controlled by NIS - Elements software . To produce CV measurements from confocal images , the standard deviation of fluorescence in a cellular compartment was divided by the mean fluorescence in that compartment . To compare actin cable levels in myo2 - 66 and wild - type cells , individual cables in summed projections of mother cells ( 10 cells per strain ) were traced in ImageJ using a line that encompassed the entire width of the cable , and the total fluorescence of each cable was mea - sured . For each mother cell , its sum cable intensity was divided by the mother cell area . Single - particle EM Each of four polypeptides was individually imaged by trans - mission EM after negative staining at the following final con - centrations : 500 nM Hof1 - FL , 500 nM each Hof1 F - BAR , 200 nM C - Bnr1 ( FH1 - FH2 - C ) , and 200 nM Bnr1 ( FH2 ) . In addition , complexes were imaged after brief mixing of the following poly - peptides at the same final concentrations as above : Hof1 - FL + C - Bnr1 and Hof1 F - BAR + Bnr1 ( FH2 ) . Proteins were applied to carbon - coated glow - discharged transmission EM grids , stained with 0 . 75 % uranyl formate two times for 30 s each , air dried , and imaged on a JEOL 2100 transmission EM . Images were captured using an Ultrascan 1000XP CCD camera ( Gatan Inc . ) at 40 , 000× magnification and 1 . 5 – 1 . 9 µm defocus . For the complexes , 80 im - ages ( fields of view ) were recorded for Hof1 F - BAR + Bnr1 ( FH2 ) and 180 images for Hof1 - FL + C - Bnr1 . Image processing and 3D reconstruction were performed using EMAN2 ( Tang et al . , 2007 ) and Relion - 2 . 0 ( Kimanius et al . , 2016 ) . 2D class averages were produced by classification in Relion - 2 . 0 of 3 , 000 untilted images of Hof1 - FL + C - Bnr1 particles and 2 , 500 untilted images of Hof1 F - BAR + Bnr1 ( FH2 ) particles . For each complex , 50 classes were produced , and 25 iterations were used to increase the signal to noise ratio . After classification , all classes were ranked according to quality . The worst classes ( representing ∼ 5 % of all particles ) were discarded due to low quality . 2D difference mapping was done in IMA GIC ( van Heel et al . , 1996 ) . A 3D reconstruction of the Hof1 - FL + C - Bnr1 complex was built in EMAN2 using the random conical tilt method . 1 , 000 particles were selected from 40 pairs of images ( at 0° and 45° angles ) . Untilted images were corrected for the microscope con - trast transfer function to account for distortions and classified into five classes . The three classes with the largest number of particles and highest signal to noise were chosen for 3D model building . One model was chosen for further refinement , for which an additional 100 untilted images were acquired . In total , 4 , 650 particles were subjected to 3D refinement in Relion - 2 . 0 . The resolution of the final structure was 10 Å . C1 symmetry was used for the final reconstruction . To generate a 3D reconstruction of the Hof1 F - BAR + Bnr1 ( FH2 ) complex , we collected 40 pairs of tilted and untilted images and processed them as above . After calculating the preliminary 3D reconstruction , 2 , 500 untilted particles were added to the set . 3 , 500 particles were used for the final reconstruction , with C1 symmetry . The resolution was 24 Å . To interpret these structures , we fit the atomic structures of the Hof1 F - BAR domain and formin FH2 domain ( Protein Data Bank accession numbers 4WPE and 1UX5 , respectively ) into our density maps using UCSF Chimera . Statistical analysis For comparisons of two categories ( Figs . 3 E , 7 C , S1 B , and S3 B ) , an unpaired two - tailed t test was used .
