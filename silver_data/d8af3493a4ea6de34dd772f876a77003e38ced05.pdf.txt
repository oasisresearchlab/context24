Immunological cross - reactivity between common cold coronaviruses ( CCC ) and SARS - CoV - 2 might account for the reduced incidence of COVID - 19 in children . Evidence to support speculation includes in vitro evidence for humoral and cellular cross - reactivity with SARS - CoV - 2 in specimens obtained before the pandemic started . Method . We used retrospective health insurance enrollment records , claims , and laboratory results to assemble a cohort of 869 , 236 insured individuals who had a PCR test for SARS - CoV - 2 . We estimated the effects of having clinical encounters for various diagnostic categories in the year preceding the study period on the risk of a positive test result . Findings . After adjusting for age , gender and care seeking behavior , we identified that individuals with diagnoses for common cold symptoms , including acute sinusitis , bronchitis , or pharyngitis in the preceding year had a lower risk of testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 ( OR = 0 . 76 , 95 % CI = 0 . 75 , 0 . 77 ) . No reduction in the odds of a positive test for SARS - CoV - 2 was 2 seen in individuals under 18 years . The reduction in odds in adults remained stable for four years but was strongest in those with recent common cold symptoms . Interpretation . While this study cannot attribute this association to cross - immunity resulting from a prior CCC infection , it is one potential explanation . Regardless of the cause , the reduction in the odds of being infected by SARS - CoV - 2 among those with a recent diagnosis of common cold symptoms may have a role in shifting future COVD - 19 infection patterns from endemic to episodic .

Introduction Early in the COVID - 19 epidemic , public health experts noted that coronavirus ( CoV ) infections were ―More Than Just the Common Cold‖ . 1 SARS - Cov - 2 , which causes COVID - 19 , is a member of the beta coronavirus genus which includes the SARS - CoV - 1 and MERS ( Middle East respiratory syndrome ) virus . The coronavirus family also includes four viruses ( 229E , NL63 , OC43 , and HKU1 ) , collectively referred to as common cold coronaviruses ( CCC ) , which account for 10 - 30 % of upper respiratory infections in adults . 2 , 3 More than 90 % of the human population is seropositive for at least three of the CCCs , indicating that they have been previously exposed . 4 The prevalence of infection with these four CCCs follows multi - year cycles and varies across the United States . 5 , 6 These infections may be a potential source of partial immunity for SARS - CoV - 2 , as noted for SARS - CoV - 1 . 7 – 9 Altman and Byten recently summarized the emerging evidence related to SARS - CoV - 2 T - cell immunity . 10 Additional evidence continues to emerge . 11 Ng et al . provide evidence of CCC and SARS - CoV - 2 humoral cross - reactivity . 12 In one study of the effect of antibodies to SARS - CoV - 2 were not protective in cell cultures . 13 However , the authors suggested that ―Future studies need to investigate whether these non - neutralizing antibody responses can confer in vivo protection despite the lack of in vitro neutralization activity . ‖ The rate of infection with SARS - CoV - 2 appears lower in children than adults , which may be due to many potential explanations . 16 , 17 In one study , Henry et al . reported that the reduced susceptibility among pediatric patients is still unknown . 18 In addition to underreporting , a combination of epidemiologic and biologic factors may account for the lower rate of infection . Children have a less mature form of the ACE - 2 receptor which the SARS - CoV - 2 virus‘ S protein binds which might decrease their susceptibility . 19 Alternatively , Lee et al . reported that fewer outdoor activities and less international travel could account for decreased incidence . 20 The immune systems of children and adults are different , both in their composition and functional responsiveness . 21 Their more active immune response and generally healthier respiratory tracts may make them less susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 22 Finally , children have a higher rate of recent CCC related infections than adults and , if there is any immunological cross - reactivity , they might be expected to have a lower rate of COVID - 19 as a result . 3 To evaluate whether cross - reactive immune memory from past common cold coronaviruses may protect against infection by SARS - CoV - 2 , we undertook an analysis of the effect of prior diagnoses of conditions with a likely viral etiology on a positive PCR test for SARS - CoV - 2 associate . Methods Study Design We used enrollment , claims , and clinical test results data from individuals enrolled with a large private US insurer with commercial or Medicare Advantage coverage . The cohort comprised of insured patients who underwent outpatient PCR tests for SARS - CoV - 2 during the study period from March 1 , 2020 to July 22 , 2020 and for whom the insurer received the clinical results and who had at least 12 months of enrollment in the health plan before being tested . The insurer received clinical results from testing performed at either of two large national laboratories but not public health or health system laboratories . We identified clinical diagnoses based on diagnoses provided on all types of administrative claims . Statistical Analysis We retrieved all ICD - 9 and ICD - 10 diagnosis codes for the cohort between March 1 , 2019 , and February 29 , 2020 , mapped the ICD - 9 codes to ICD - 10 and created 308 diagnostic categories based on the phenotype definitions created by Kuan et al . 23 We included in the logistic regression analysis the fifty - one categories that were present in at least 1 % of the cohort . For each of these 51 diagnostic categories individually , we estimated the odds of a positive PCR test result based on the presence or absence of a diagnosis in the disease category during the preceding year . Age and gender were entered into the model as covariates . We also performed a stratified analysis by age of the risk of having a positive PCR test for SARS - CoV - 2 associated with prior diagnoses of conditions with an underlying viral etiology . After identifying that diagnostic categories likely associated with CCC infection were associated with a decreased likelihood of SARS - CoV - 2 test positivity , we analyzed the 15 individual ICD - 10 codes ( out of 113 ) that comprise the ‗Ear and upper respiratory tract infection‘ and ‗Other or unspecified infectious organisms‘ that were present in at least 0 . 5 % of the cohort along with age and gender for a positive PCR test . To test care seeking behavior differences , we counted the number of distinct days with diagnoses in the study period and used this number as an additional covariate in the regression analyses . Probabilistic sensitivity analysis for exposure misclassification was performed using the episensr R package ( version 0 . 9 . 6 ) . We assumed non - differential misclassification bias , and applied the probsens function , with 1 million replications of uniform distribution of the whole range of possible sensitives and specificities that do not lead to negative cells in the adjusted 2x2 table . 4 To test for temporal effects , we performed a 30 - days rolling window of the time of last CCC - related symptoms starting from January 1 st , 2016 . Results Our cohort consisted of 869 , 236 tested individuals , of whom 131 , 103 ( 15 . 1 % ) had a positive COVID - 19 result . It included individuals from all age groups , and almost all US states . Age and gender distributions were similar for individuals whose SARS - CoV - 2 test was positive or negative ( Figure 1A - B ) . Figure 1 . Study cohort . A ) Individuals that were not enrolled for 12 months prior the SARS - CoV - 2 test were excluded . B ) The age ( left ) and gender ( right ) distributions of individuals with positive and negative PCR tests for SARS - CoV - 2 were similar . 15 . 1 % of the individuals in the cohort were SARS - CoV - 2 positive . Risk of Positive SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test To identify diagnostic categories associated with COVID - 19 infection , we analyzed 51 diagnostic categories ( Figure 2A and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Two diagnostic categories associated with viral etiologies were associated with a reduced risk of a positive PCR test for SARS - CoV - 2 : ‗Ear and upper respiratory tract infection‘ ( Odds ratio = 0 . 81 , 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) = 0 . 80 , 0 . 82 , p - value < 1e - 16 ) and ‗Other or unspecified infectious organisms‘ ( Odds ratio = 0 . 87 , 95 % CI = 0 . 86 , 0 . 88 , p - value < 1e - 16 ) . To identify individual diagnoses within the diagnostic categories associated with a reduced SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rate , we performed a similar analysis on the specific codes that comprised the significantly associated groups ( Figure 2B and Supplementary Table 2 ) . With this 5 analysis , we identified the codes for acute sinusitis ( J01 ) , and acute bronchitis from an unspecified source ( J20 . 9 ) and acute pharyngitis from an unspecified source ( J02 . 8 and J02 . 9 ) to be strongly associated with the reduced positivity rate . All three of these symptoms can be caused by CCC . Figure 2 . Phenotypes and diagnoses associated with a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test . A ) A volcano plot of the effect size of prevalent diagnostic categories on SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test positivity and significance ( log scale ) .

B ) A volcano plot of the effect size of prevalent ICD - 10 diagnosis codes on SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test positivity and significance ( log scale ) . The size of the circle is proportional to the number of individuals with the phenotype , and red circles indicate significance ( p < 1e - 15 ) . 6 We identified 60 , 254 ( 6 . 9 % of the entire cohort ) affected individuals with acute sinusitis , 24 , 521 ( 2 . 8 % ) with acute bronchitis of an unspecified source , and 56 , 521 ( 6 . 5 % ) individuals with acute pharyngitis of an unspecified source in the year before the study period between March 1 , 2019 , and February 29 , 2020 . There were 126 , 998 ( 14 . 6 % ) individuals had at least one of those diagnoses , and 15 , 650 ( 1 . 8 % ) had two of the diagnoses in the year before the study period . The age distribution of individuals with these specific diagnoses was skewed to younger ages than the distribution of the overall cohort of tested individuals ( 41 . 4 years vs . 44 . 8 years , t - test p < 1e - 16 ) ( Figure 3A - C ) . Females accounted for a more significant proportion ( 64 . 5 % of individuals vs . 54 . 8 % , 1 - sample proportion test p = 5e - 6 ) ( Figure 3B ) . Of those with a diagnosis for one of the symptoms , 15 , 481 individuals had a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test ( 12 . 2 % ) compared to our baseline of 15 . 1 % for individuals without any of the diagnoses . Adjusted to age and gender , this translates to reduced odds for infection by 26 . 3 % ( OR = 0 . 79 , 95 % CI = 0 . 78 , 0 . 81 , p - value < 1e - 16 ) ( Figure 3D ) . Figure 3 .

( D ) Odds ratios for having a positive PCR test for SARS - CoV - 2 , stratified by age . 7 Age Stratification In the age - stratified analysis , we found that the risk of a positive SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test varied by age . Contrary to adults , in individuals under 18 , the odds of SARS - Cov - 2 PCR test positivity did not differentiate between similar in those with and without prior visits for symptoms ( OR in > 18 years = 0 . 78 , 95 % CI = 0 . 77 , 0 . 8 . OR in < 18 years = 0 . 95 , 95 % CI = 0 . 88 , 1 . 02 ) ( Figure 3D ) . We further noticed that the odds gradually increased with age : while there is no effect in individuals under ten years old , and mild protective effect in individuals under 30 years old , the odds ratio gradually decreases to 0 . 61 ( 95 % CI = 0 . 52 , 0 . 71 ) ( Extended Figure 1 ) . Extended Figure 1 . Age stratification . Odds ratios for having a positive PCR test for SARS - CoV - 2 , stratified by age groups . Care - seeking behavior We further tested whether this reduced risk for a positive SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test can be explained by differential care - seeking behaviors . For each individual , we counted the number of distinct days with a clinical visit with any diagnosis code during the year preceding the study period . The median number of days with a diagnosis in the overall cohort was seven days . Individuals with a CCC - related symptom , on the other hand , had a median of 15 days with symptoms in the year preceding the study period ( Wilcoxon rank - sum p - value < 1e - 16 ) , which might suggest greater care - seeking among individuals with CCC symptoms ( Extended Figure 2A ) . However , in our data , SARS - CoV - 2 positive test rates are also associated with the number of days with a diagnosis , and the reduced positivity rate observed in individuals with CCC symptoms is lower across the whole range of the number of visits ( Extended Figure 2B ) . Accordingly , adding this feature as a covariate to the risk analysis reduces the odds ratio from 0 . 79 without adjusted to number of visits to 0 . 76 with the adjustment ( Extended Figure 2C ) . 8 Extended Figure 2 . Care seeking behavior . A ) Violin plot of the number of visits for individuals stratified by SARS - CoV - 2 test results ( right ) and exposure to CCC symptoms ( left ) . Median , upper and lower quartiles are shown . B ) Smoothed lines of the SARS - CoV - 2 positive rate across a range of the number of visits . C ) Odds ratios for SARS - CoV - 2 positive tests for the age and gender - adjusted model vs the age , gender , and the number of visits model . Given the difference in care - seeking behavior in individuals whose SARS - CoV - 2 PCR tests were negative from those with positive tests and knowing that many individuals with symptoms of the common cold don‘t seek care from a physician , we performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis for exposure misclassification using the whole range of possible sensitivities and specificities . 24 Based on this analysis , the misclassification bias - corrected odds ratio decreased to 0 . 55 ( 95 % CI = 0 . 06 , 0 . 73 ) . Importantly , in all the range of possible sensitivities and specificities , we observed that the misclassification bias is in the direction of increasing the negative association between CCC symptoms and SARS - CoV - 2 PCR tests , up to an effect of 20 - fold reduced risk for individuals with CCC symptoms in the preceding year ( Extended Figure 3 ) . 9 Extended Figure 3 . Misclassification bias analysis . Plot shows the misclassification bias adjusted odds ratios across the whole range of specificity , and for sensitivities of 0 . 9 , 0 . 925 , 0 . 95 and 0 . 975 . Time Interval Between Diagnosis and Testing To test whether this association is short term or long term , we extracted information for the three CCC - related diagnoses from 2016 through 2020 . Focusing on adults ( age > 18 years ) in our cohort , we identified 258 , 657 ( 31 . 4 % ) with at least one of the diagnoses since 2016 . The SARS - CoV - 2 positive rate for this group was 12 . 9 % compared to 15 . 3 % in all adults ( Odds ratio adjusted for age and gender = 0 . 78 , 95 % CI = 0 . 76 , 0 . 80 ) , p - value < 1e - 16 ) . Interestingly , the reduction in risk was similar across the years 2016 through 2019 ( Figure 4 ) . However , we observed marked potential immunity in individuals with symptoms in the first two months of 2020 . Of the 19 , 902 individuals with the common cold symptoms in January and February 2020 , only 11 . 8 % had a positive test result . 10 Figure 4 . Protective effect of common cold symptoms over time . Thirty - day moving average of the temporal association between the last date the ICD - 10 diagnosis code was recorded and the PCR test for SARS - CoV - 2 in 2020 . Discussion Encounters for CCC - related symptoms are associated with a significantly decreased odds of a positive PCR test for SARS - CoV - 2 in adults but not children . Cross - reactivity between CCC and SARS - CoV - 2 is a potential explanation for this decrease . Presumably , there should not be an association between most clinical diagnoses and having a positive test for SARS - CoV - 2 due to immunological factors . For example , immunologically , we wouldn‘t expect an individual with type 2 diabetes to be more susceptible to infection . However , since the population tested for COVID - 19 is likely to consist of individuals with symptoms , diagnostic categories that complicate COVD - 19 would be more likely to get tested and confirmed as infected . In accordance , our analysis identified several diagnostic categories that are significantly positively associated with a positive SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test result , including diabetes , heart disease , obesity , and anemia , all of which others have also found to be associated with increased risk of COVID - 19 hospitalizations ( Figure 2A and Supplementary Table 1 ) . 25 Relevant to our hypothesis , we observed several diagnostic categories negatively associated with positive SARS - CoV - 2 PCR test results , including actinic keratosis , ear and upper respiratory tract infection , and anxiety disorders ( Figure 2A ) . When we analyzed specific ICD - 10 codes , we found that conditions sometimes caused by CCC , including acute sinusitis and acute bronchitis and acute pharyngitis , were most significant ( Figure 2B and Supplementary Table 2 ) . Our analysis of the effect on SARS - CoV - 2 PCR positivity based on how long before the test the relevant diagnosis was made suggests that the effect may be short lived . 11 While our measured risk factor of interest in our cohort was receiving a diagnosis related to common cold symptoms , CCCs account for 10 - 30 % of colds and presumably of the office visits for common cold symptoms . The rest of these diagnoses are caused by a variety of other viruses , so our data don‘t provide direct evidence that prior infection with CCC is the cause of the reduced risk of a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test . However , our data suggest that combined with the immunological evidence for cross - reactivity between SARS - CoV - 2 and CCCs infection due to CCC seems a possible explanation for the difference in test positivity rate that we observe . Children , who have four or five times as many common colds as adults each year presumably partly attributable to more CCC exposure , have been seen to have a lower incidence and less severe cases of COVID - 19 . 26 One recent study , however , suggested that there is no difference in the prevalence of CCC antibodies in children with COVID - 19 and control subjects . 27 Our analysis revealed similar findings , where children had no difference in the COVID - 19 test positivity rate , whether they had a diagnosis of a common cold - related symptom previously or not ( Figure 3D and Extended Figure 1 ) . One possible explanation is that essentially all children have had CCC exposures in the previous year whether they sought medical attention and received a diagnosis or not . Given the high prevalence of CCC antibodies in the adult population , the size of the protective effect we observe on SARS - CoV - 2 infection might seem small . Several potential factors may account for the effect size . First , while upper respiratory infections account for a significant number of healthcare encounters , individuals manage many episodes with over the counter medications and self - care . Using misclassification bias analysis of exposure to CCC , we estimated that CCC infection might reduce the risk for COVID - 19 by up to 20 - fold , and average by 81 % . It is hard to estimate the true sensitivity and specificity parameters . However , we observed strong effects for a wide range of parameters , suggesting that our 26 % reduced risk may be a conservative estimate or the real potential effect . A counter argument is that individuals who do not seek care might have had milder symptoms , and this may result in a less robust immune response than would be seen in a more severe infection . Another potential factor that may increase the effect is study time period . Our primary estimate of the odds ratio is based exclusively on diagnoses during the year preceding the study period and didn‘t include diagnoses in previous years , which , as the time series analysis shows , may be relevant ( Figure 4 ) . As a non - randomized study , our findings are susceptible to bias such as unmeasured confounding . The demographics of the individuals in our study are fairly uniform , as supported by the demographic descriptions and the fact that they are all insured with commercial insurance or Medicare Advantage . The groups also had similar access to testing recognizing the access was likely widely different across the country . One potential bias might be differences in care - seeking behaviors between the two groups . Those with a diagnosis of infections sometimes caused by CCCs may be more prone to seek care and could have been tested for SARS - CoV - 2 more often , resulting in a detection bias . Indeed , our analysis confirmed that this is the case ( Extended Figure 2 ) . However , further analysis showed that this confounder does not explain the reduced risk effect , and supposedly increases the protective effect . An explanation for this counter - intuitive result is that individuals with more office visits tend to be sicker , and those tend 12 to have more severe symptoms COVID - 19 and thus are less diluted with asymptomatic individuals . There are several potential implications of our findings . Prior diagnosis of an infection that may be caused by CCC may reduce the severity of COVID - 19 . The severity of symptoms in patients infected with SARS - CoV - 2 varies widely from asymptomatic to fatal . Others have reported factors such as age and comorbidities to be risk factors for severity , but the immunological response could be a risk . It is plausible that people with a high number of pre - existing memory CD4 + T cells that recognize SARS - CoV - 2 could mount a faster and more robust immune response upon exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 and thereby limit disease severity . Memory T follicular helper ( TFH ) CD4 + T cells could potentially facilitate an increased and more rapid neutralizing antibody response against SARS - CoV - 2 . Memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells might also promote direct antiviral immunity in the lungs and nasopharynx early after exposure . There may also be significant implications for the course of the pandemic as a result of introducing variability in the susceptibility of individuals , which could lower the threshold for herd immunity . 30 Given that production capacity for COVID - 19 vaccines , when they are ready , may be limited , cross - immunity from prior infection may help bridge the gap to herd immunity . In another study examining whether COVID - 19 will become a cyclically recurring epidemic , burn itself out or follow another course , the investigators found that even weak cross - immunity to SARS - CoV - 2 ( approximately 30 percent ) could substantially delay future outbreaks . 31 There are several limitations to our study . The data is enriched with individuals with more severe COVID - 19 cases as patients with more severe symptoms may have been more likely to be tested early in the pandemic when test availability was limited . In addition , our dataset does not include laboratory results for all patients . Finally , we are only able to demonstrate an association , not causality , and other confounding factors associated with these individuals may account for the differences in the odds of a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test . The decreased odds for a positive PCR test for SARS - CoV - 2 among those with a prior CCC - related diagnosis is an important observation that warrants replication and consideration as stakeholders make the complex policy and clinical decisions about how to manage the COVID - 19 pandemic . 13 References 1 .
