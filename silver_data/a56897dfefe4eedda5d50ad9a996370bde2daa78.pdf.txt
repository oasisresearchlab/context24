Politi , Alexis Perez - Gonzalez , Julia Mergenthaler , Yin Cai , and Jan Ellenberg European Molecular Biology Laboratory , 69117 Heidelberg , Germany ABSTRACT Fluorescence tagging of proteins is a widely used tool to study protein function and dynamics in live cells . However , the extent to which different mammalian transgene methods faithfully report on the properties of endogenous proteins has not been studied comparatively . Here we use quantitative live - cell imaging and single - molecule spectroscopy to analyze how different transgene systems affect imaging of the functional properties of the mitotic kinase Aurora B . We show that the transgene method fundamentally influences level and variability of expression and can severely compromise the ability to report on endoge - nous binding and localization parameters , providing a guide for quantitative imaging studies in mammalian cells . INTRODUCTION Gene tagging with green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) has revolution - ized our understanding of the dynamic properties of the cellular proteome . Powerful fluorescence imaging technologies have made quantitative measurements of protein biophysics and biochemistry feasible in situ ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ; Maeder et al . , 2007 ) . High - throughput imaging and computational data integration make such studies scalable to whole pathways and proteomes ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ; Maeder et al . , 2007 ) . Whereas fusing fluorescent tags to en - dogenous proteins is routine in yeast , in human cells , the insight gained from quantitative imaging approaches has been limited by the available transgene methodologies . The majority of past studies relied on systems that do not faithfully maintain physiological gene expression , such as cDNA plasmids with heterologous promoters that are randomly integrated into the human cell’s genome for stable expression . The resulting overexpression or underexpression is known to affect protein function through numerous mechanisms , such as nonspecific aggregation , alterations in folding , and imbal - ance with endogenous binding partners ( Burgess et al . , 2012 ; Gibson et al . , 2013 ) . These considerations have motivated the de - velopment of second - generation plasmid - based systems such as bacterial artificial chromosomes ( BACs ) , which retain endogenous cis - acting regulatory sequences and can also be randomly inte - grated into the genome of the host cell ( Poser et al . , 2008 ) . How - ever , position - effect variegation in BACs has not been investigated , and all superexpression systems suffer from the continued presence of untagged protein produced from endogenous loci , which cannot be imaged but may carry out all or part of the function of the fusion protein under study ( Yue et al . , 2008 ) . Although RNA interference ( RNAi ) knockdown of endogenous protein can be used in combina - tion with RNAi - resistant transgenes , incomplete knockdown and off - target effects make such experiments difficult to control and in - terpret ( Ma et al . , 2006 ) . Recently multiple genome - editing tech - nologies , including zinc finger nucleases ( ZFNs ) and Tale - activated endonucleases ( TALENs ) , have been developed to modify endoge - nous mammalian loci ( Bibikova et al . , 2003 ; Miller et al . , 2011 ) . How - ever , whether such knock - in transgenes truly are quantitatively supe - rior to superexpression approaches has not been systematically studied to date .

In addition , we per - formed random integration of BACs or cDNA plasmids ( Figure 1Aii ; Poser et al . , 2008 ) . For each transgene method ( Figure 1A ) , we cre - ated several monoclonal or pooled HeLa lines stably expressing mitotic kinase Aurora kinase B ( AURKB - GFP ) using four different transgene methods ( Figure 1A ) . We used genome editing by ZFNs ( Bibikova et al . , 2003 ) or TALENs ( Miller et al . , 2011 ) to target recom - bination of EGFP from a donor plasmid containing regions of FIGURE 1 : Construction and validation of genome - edited cell lines expressing AURKB - GFP .

Mahen et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell levels . As expected for a constitutive heterologous promoter ( cyto - megalovirus ; Boshart et al . , 1985 ) , different cDNA clones showed the strongest overexpression and the most variable expression be - tween cell lines ( ∼ 0 . 4 – to 5 . 7 - fold ) . Flow cytometry of the intensity distribution of AURKB - GFP from 20 , 000 cells for each tagging method showed greatest cell - to - cell homogeneity for the two ge - nome - editing methods ( CV = 23 [ ZFN ] , 23 [ TALEN ] ) , followed by BACs and cDNAs , which exhibited more variability ( Figure 2B ; CV = 30 and 112 , respectively ) . Similarly , whereas in genome - edited and BAC systems , nearly all cells expressed the fusion protein ( ZFN , 99 % ; BAC , 92 – 99 % ) , cDNA clones had a variable number of ex - pressing cells ( Figure 2B ; 28 – 89 % ) . Having assessed total expression level and cell - to - cell variation , we next addressed subcellular abundance of the fusion proteins in mitotic metaphase , when AURKB resides mostly on mitotic chro - mosomes ( Carmena et al . , 2012 ) . Genome - edited cells exhibited the expected specific localization to metaphase chromosomes , with barely detectable levels of unbound cytoplasmic protein . By con - trast , overexpression from the plasmid - based systems led to ele - vated cytoplasmic signal ( Figure 2C and Supplemental Figure S2B , arrowheads ) . We quantified the absolute cytoplasmic concentration of AURKB - GFP using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) in living cells . FCS records fluorescence intensity fluctuations in a small confocal volume as a function of time , allowing determination of physical properties , including the concentration of the fluorescent species from the amplitude of the FCS autocorrelation function ( Figure 2D ; see Materials and Methods ) . As such , it is well suited to the detection of mobile cytosolic proteins expressed at nanomolar to micromolar levels . AURKB - GFP genome - edited cells showed a clear autocorrelation signal distinguishable from that of wild - type cells ( Supplemental Figure S2C ) , indicating the presence of a cyto - plasmic pool . Consistent with our Western blotting , flow cytometry , and fluorescence microscopy data , FCS analysis showed that AURKB - GFP genome – edited cells had a low cytoplasmic concentration of 8 . 6 nM ± 5 . 3 SD ( ZFN ) or 6 . 9 nM ± 3 . 5 ( TALEN ) , whereas overexpres - sion from the plasmid - based systems resulted in significantly higher cytoplasmic concentrations of 23 . 8 nM ± 17 . 1 ( BAC ) or 86 . 7 nM ± 156 . 7 ( cDNA ; Figure 2 , E and F , and Supplemental Figure S2D ) . AURKB plays several critical roles in genome segregation via the phosphorylation of substrates on chromatin such as core histones and kinetochore proteins and by forming phosphorylation gradients ( Tanaka et al . , 2002 ; Wang et al . , 2011 ; Carmena et al . , 2012 ) . The balance between soluble cytoplasmic and chromosome - bound ki - nase is therefore key to interpreting its function . To determine whether the transgene method would perturb this balance , we quantified the amount of AURKB - GFP localized to chromosomes on the metaphase plate using FCS - calibrated confocal imaging in live , dividing cells . Here first we recorded an FCS trace in the cytoplasm to determine the absolute local concentration of GFP and calibrate the corresponding confocal pixel intensity , which thus allows us to transform the entire confocal image into a concentration map ( Figure 3A ) . Despite the different total cell expression levels , BACs showed a similar chromatin - bound AURKB - GFP concentration to genome - edited cells , whereas cDNAs were very variable ( Figure 3 , B and C ) . By combining our concentration measurements with three - dimensional reconstructed volumes of mitotic chromosomes and cytoplasm , we obtained the total number of chromatin - bound and free AURKB - GFP proteins . We found that the fraction of AURKB - GFP bound to chromatin is significantly higher in genome - edited cells than in plasmid - based systems ( Figure 3D ) . Whereas in ge - nome - edited cells , ∼ 75 % of total cellular AURKB - GFP resides on chromatin , only 40 - 50 % does so in plasmid - based systems , with the AURKB - GFP , which we validated with a series of assays ( Figure 1B ; see Materials and Methods for detailed protocols ) . Briefly , after in - troduction of the tag , expressing cells were isolated by fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ; Figure 1C ) and then screened by fluo - rescence microscopy for specific localization to mitotic organelles as expected for AURKB ( Figure 1D ; Terada et al . , 1998 ) . We distin - guished homozygous from heterozygous clones ( AURKB has three alleles in HeLa cells ; Landry et al . , 2013 ) for the genome - editing methods ( Figure 1B ; In vitro ) by genomic PCR ( Figure 1E and Sup - plemental Figure S1A ) , Western blot ( Figure 1F and Supplemental Figure S1B ) , and Southern blot ( Figure 1G and Supplemental Figure S1 , C and D ) . This validation workflow allowed us to select clones with homozy - gous insertion of EGFP into all three AURKB alleles as well as heterozygous clones for further analysis . Independent of the target - ing method used for genome editing , we found some evidence of extra integration sites by Southern blot ( Figure 1G and Supplemental Figure S1 , C and D ) . This did not result in unexpected size bands by genomic PCR or Western blot , however ( Figure 1 , E and F , and Sup - plemental Figure S1 , A and B ) , and therefore they likely lie in non - coding regions . Homozygous and heterozygous AURKB - GFP cells exhibited indistinguishable cell cycle timing compared with wild - type HeLa cells as measured by automated classification of live - cell imaging data ( Held et al . , 2010 ; Figure 1H and Supplemental Figure S1E ) or flow cytometry ( Supplemental Figure S1F ) , indicating that the fluorescent fusion protein was fully functional to support cell division . The complete set of cell lines used in this study is listed in Table 1 . Having validated this set of AURKB - GFP cells generated from the same parental HeLa line , we systematically analyzed the behav - ior of the expressed fusion proteins . First , we examined total ex - pression level of AURKB - GFP by Western blotting of whole - cell ex - tracts with anti - AURKB or anti - GFP antibodies ( Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure S2A ) . All genome - edited clones exhibited AURKB - GFP levels similar to the endogenous protein with relatively little variation and independent of the genome - targeting method used to generate them or their zygosity ( ∼ 0 . 6 - to 1 . 7 - fold wild type ) . By contrast , expression of AURKB - GFP from randomly integrated BACs resulted in clearly visible overexpression in the tested clones ( ∼ 2 . 1 - to 3 . 6 - fold wild type ) , suggesting that the presence of the native promoter is not sufficient to ensure physiological expression Expression system Name Transgene species ZFN Z HZ1 Human ZFN Z HZ2 Human ZFN Z HET1 Human TALEN T HET1 Human TALEN T HET2 Human mBAC B P1 Mouse mBAC BC1 Mouse mBAC B P2 Mouse mBAC B C2 Mouse cDNA cD P1 Human cDNA cD C1 Human cDNA cD C2 Human cDNA cD C3 Human TABLE 1 : Cell lines used in this study . Volume 25 November 5 , 2014 Systematic comparison transgene methods | 3613 that chromatin - binding sites become saturated in overexpression systems , forcing aberrant accumulation of the fusion protein in the cytosol . A key prerequisite for systems microscopy is to detect complexes incorporating the tagged protein inside the cell . It is known that fraction decreasing as the total amount of AURKB increases . This relationship is in agreement with a mathematical model ( solid line in Figure 3E ; see Materials and Methods ) that has a limited number of high - affinity binding sites on chromatin ( ∼ 130 , 000 – 150 , 000 mole - cules ) , with a binding K d of 3 . 4 – 5 . 8 nM . Thus , our results suggest FIGURE 2 : Expression system determines AURKB - GFP levels . ( A ) Western blot comparison of AURKB levels in nocodazole - arrested cells .

If quantitative imaging of in vivo proteomic parameters is the objective , genome editing appears to be the method of choice to fluorescently tag genes in human cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS Constructs , cell line construction , and growth Zinc finger nucleases were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) with DNA - binding sequences in the 5 ′ – 3 ′ direction of CGC - CTGATGGTCCCT and CACTCGGGTGCGTGTGTT . TALENs were from Cellectis Bioresearch ( Romainville , France ) with DNA - binding domains in the 5 ′ – 3 ′ direction of TTCACTCGGGTGCGTGT and TATGTATAGGGGAAAGA . The donor plasmid consisted of mEGFP cDNA sequence flanked by a left homology arm ( ENSEMBL release 75 , ENST00000316199 , chromosome 17 : 8108992 - 8108191 ) and a right homology arm ( ENSEMBL release 75 , ENST00000316199 , chromosome 17 : 8107923 - 8108440 ) , consisting of AURKB genomic sequence . ZFN / TALEN and donor plasmid transfection was with jetPRIME reagent ( Polyplus , Illkirch - Graffenstaden , France ) . We in - cubated 0 . 5 μg of each ZFN / TALEN and 1 μg of donor plasmid for 15 min with 200 μl of jetPRIME buffer and 4 μl of jetPRIME before addition to cells grown to 80 % confluency in a six - well dish with 2 ml of growth medium . After 4 h , the transfection mix was changed to normal medium . HeLa Kyoto cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum at 37°C . Cells expressing AURKB - GFP mouse BAC as pool were previously described ( Neumann et al . , 2010 ) , and further pools were also obtained as a kind gift from T . Hyman and I . Poser ( Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics , Dresden , Germany ) . cDNA AURKB - GFP was cloned by inserting GFP into the Sal 1 and Bam H1 sites of the vector AURKB - mCherry pEGFP - N1 ( a kind gift of M . Isokane , European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Heidelberg , Germany ) . Cells expressing cDNA AURKB - GFP were selected in 500 μg / ml neomycin and cells expressing cDNA H2B - mCherry with 0 . 3 μg / ml puromycin . Fluorescence - activated cell sorting and flow cytometry At 7 – 10 d posttransfection of genome - editing constructs , cells were synchronized with 2 mM thymidine for 18 h and subsequently released into fresh medium for 7 – 8 h . Mitotic cells were collected via mitotic shakeoff before sorting . GFP + HeLa Kyoto cells were sorted with a MoFlo Legacy cell sorter ( Beckman Coulter ) equipped with a 100 - μm nozzle . BD FACSFlow sheath ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) was used as sheath fluid , filtered in - line through a PALL Fluorodyne II filter 0 . 2 μm ( Pall ) . A 488 nm – tuned Coherent Sabre laser ( TEM 00 mode , 200 mW ) was used for the excitation of GFP . Fluorescence was collected and detected after filtering through 488 - nm StopLine single - notch and 512 / 15 BP filters . Laser illumi - nation , Moflo’s L - configuration optical layout , and sorting were optimized using Flow - Check Fluorospheres ( Beckman Coulter , Pasadena , CA ) . Sort decision was based on a combination of regions drawn around FSC - area versus SSC - area and FSC - area versus pulse width together with 488 nm – derived fluorescence 512 / 15 BP ( GFP ) versus 670 / 40 BP ( autofluorescence ) plots . Parental HeLa Kyoto cells transfected only with donor plasmid were used as negative control . No correlation was seen between the level of AURKB - GFP expression and the number of alleles integrated by PCR and Western analysis . Cell cycle analysis was performed on an LSR - Fortessa SORP cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) after staining with propidium iodide ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) ; cells were washed in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , fixed in cold 70 % ethanol for > 2 h , washed in PBS , and AURKB engages in numerous complexes in mitotic cells , including binding to members of the so - called chromosomal passenger com - plex ( Wang et al . , 2011 ; Carmena et al . , 2012 ) , which should cause a decrease in its mobility in the cytoplasm . To assess whether the cytoplasmic accumulation in overexpressing clones would interfere with our ability to detect AURKB - containing complexes of low mobility , we determined the diffusion coefficient of AURKB - GFP by FCS . During interphase , AURKB - GFP cytoplasmic diffusion coeffi - cients were indistinguishable between different transgene methods ( ZFN , 13 . 2 μm 2 / s ± 6 . 4 SD ; BAC , 14 . 0 μm 2 / s ± 4 . 6 ; Figure 3F , unfilled bars ) . However , metaphase cells exhibited significant differences in diffusion coefficient between expression systems ( Figure 3F , filled bars ) . Genome - edited cells had reduced AURKB - GFP mobility com - pared with interphase ( ZFN , 6 . 5 μm 2 / s ± 3 . 9 SD ) , indicative of being bound to complexes of a larger Stokes radius , whereas in BAC cells , no significant change was detected ( BAC , 14 . 7 μm 2 / s ± 3 . 9 ) . Of interest , cDNA cells showed variable behavior , with a decrease in diffusional mobility detectable only in cells with low AURKB - GFP expression level ( cD C3 ; ∼ 10 nM cytoplasmic ) but not in higher - ex - pressing clones ( cD C2 ) . Using automated time - lapse FCS to track single living nuclei through cell division , we acquired images and spectroscopy data every 15 min in dividing cells . Again , the cell cy - cle – dependent reversible change in diffusion coefficient from G2 to mitosis to G1 indicative of complex formation could readily be de - tected in single genome - edited cells but was not detectable in BAC - derived cells ( Figure 3G ) . DISCUSSION Overall our findings show that the choice of transgene system strongly affects expression level and variability of fluorescently tagged genes in human cells . These expression changes have im - portant consequences for the accurate quantitation of endogenous binding parameters using microscopy . Our data indicate a clear an - ticorrelation between overexpression—with free ligand dominating the overall pool—and the ability to detect both specifically localized protein and protein engaged in large complexes . In terms of achiev - ing a close to physiological expression level , the genome editing methods clearly outperformed plasmid - based approaches that suf - fer from heterologous promoters ( cDNA ) and position - effect varie - gation ( cDNA and BAC ) . Furthermore , genome - edited cell lines showed far greater homogeneity , with almost any clone obtained by thorough screening ( Figure 1 ) closely matching endogenous levels . Consistent with previous work ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ) , this has implica - tions for understanding the biology of cellular systems tagged with fluorescent proteins in human cells . However , it is also an important practical consideration when making cell lines stably expressing fluorescent fusion proteins , since it is often impossible to screen for true endogenous levels of expression in all subcellular pools . In ad - dition , for essential genes , homozygous genome - edited cells en - sure biological functionality of the fusion protein and exclude the possibility that complex formation and specific binding are obscured by the presence of unlabeled endogenous protein . A frequent argument for randomly integrated plasmid - based transgenes has been that for functionally important tagged genes , surviving clones would automatically select for physiological expres - sion level ( Rabut et al . , 2004 ) . Our case study with Aurora B provides reason for caution . We could generate stable plasmid - based cell clones with up to 100 - fold overexpression that did not reveal gross phenotypic differences in cell division timing or histone H3 phos - phorylation ( Supplemental Figure S3 , A – C ) . Nevertheless , the rele - vant biophysical properties of Aurora B were completely obscured in these cells due to a massive unbound pool in the cytoplasm . 3616 | R . Mahen et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell phase length measurements , classification results were corrected with hidden Markov models afterward . Western blotting Cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Tris HCl , pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP40 , 0 . 5 M sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS , complete protease inhibitor cocktail , PhosSTOP [ Roche ] ) . Protein concentration was quantitated using the bicinchoninic acid method ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Antibodies used in overnight incubations were anti - AIM - 1 1 : 400 ( 611082 ; BD Bioscience ) , anti - LEM4 ( 1 : 2000 ) , and anti - GFP ( Yavuz et al . , 2010 ) . Bands were quantified in Fiji using the Gel Analyzer tool and normalized relative to a standard on each gel consisting of either wild - type HeLa cells or ZFN clone HZ2 . Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy was performed with a Zeiss LSM 780 ConfoCor3 system as previously described ( Maeder et al . , 2007 ; Schmidt et al . , 2009 ) . Samples were incubated at 37°C and excited with a 488 - nm laser at minimal power ( < 1 kW / cm 2 ) to re - duce bleaching , photophysical effects , and cellular toxicity . Light was focused with a water immersion 40 × / 1 . 2 NA objective lens and collected by two avalanche photodiodes in the spectrally distinct regions 505 – 540 nm ( F g ) and 600 – 650 nm ( F r ) after passing through a pinhole set to 1 Airy unit . The instrument was calibrated before each experiment using Alexa 488 and Alexa 568 to align the pin - holes and perform coverglass corrections . Each measurement was taken for 30 s in total . From the fluorescence time traces F g and F r , temporal autocor - relation functions were calculated according to G t F t F t F t F t F t F t dt G G t ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( ) , ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 , ( ) ( , ) g r g r g r t g r t g r g r g r t t t t g r g r / / / , / , 2 / / / , , / / ∫ τ δ δ τ δ θ τ τ θ ′ = + = − = = ′ θ θ θ θ θ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ +   ( 1 ) Here local averaging with a typical window size of θ ∼ 1 s allows for the correction of slow processes such as cellular movement and photobleaching . Resulting autocorrelation functions were then fit - ted with a model function for anomalous diffusion including mole - cular blinking as sources of fluctuations ( Schmidt et al . , 2009 ) : G N s ( ) 1 1 exp 1 1 1 g r D D / blink 1 2 1 / 2 τ ρ ρ ττ ττ ττ ( ) ( ) ( ) = − + −    ⋅ +     ⋅ +     α α − − ( 2 ) where N = cV eff is the number of fluorescent molecules in the focal volume V eff and c their concentration , ρ is the fraction of molecules in a nonfluorescent state with a lifetime τ blink , and α is the anomaly parameter of diffusion resulting in a mean dwell time τ diff of the molecules in the focus . The diffusion coefficient D = w 0 2 / 4 τ diff and the concentration c were extracted after calibrating the focal vol - ume V eff = π 3 / 2 w 0 3 s and the lateral and axial focal radii w 0 and sw 0 using FCS measurements of Alexa 488 with a known diffusion coef - ficient . For FCS data processing we used the Fluctuation Analyzer software ( written by Malte Wachsmuth , European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Heidelberg , Germany ; available upon request ) . Automated FCS with single - cell tracking was performed using an in - house - adapted Zeiss 780 ConfoCor3 system . Image and FCS acquisition were coordinated using a custom - written VBA macro ( AutofocusScreen , available on request ) , which coordinated then stained with 40 μg / ml propidium iodide containing 0 . 1 % Triton - 100 and RNase A overnight at room temperature to ensure saturation of DNA staining . Cell cycle – stage analysis was performed by fitting with the cell cycle Watson ( pragmatic ) algorithm in FlowJo v7 . 6 . 4 software ( Tree Star , Ashland , OR ) . Genomic PCR Junction genomic PCR was performed at endogenous AURKB loci to detect the insertion of EGFP at the C - terminus using two separate sets of primers , one of which annealed inside GFP and one outside , as follows : AURKB forward ( AGCTGGAGGTCCATCCTTGT ) , AURKB reverse ( ATCACTGCTGCTTCTATTGGCT ) , and mEGFP reverse ( gatgttgccgtcctccttga ) . PCR was performed using HotStar HiFidelity ( Qiagen , Venlo , Netherlands ) according to the supplier’s manual and with a primer annealing temperature of 53ºC . Southern blotting Genomic DNA was prepared with the MasterPure DNA Purification Kit ( Epicentre Biotechnologies , Madison , WI ) according to the sup - plier’s manual . Twenty micrograms of genomic DNA was digested with either Xba I or Kpn I / Nsi I ( NEB ) at 37°C overnight . We performed 0 . 8 % agarose gel electrophoresis , and the gel was denatured with 2 × 20 - min washes in 0 . 5 M NaOH / 1 . 5 M NaCl . After neutralization by 2 × 20 - min incubation in 1 . 5 M NaCl / 0 . 5 M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 0 , the DNA fragments were transferred via capillary forces from the gel to a Genescreen Plus R Nylon membrane ( PerkinElmer , Boston , MA ) in 10 × SSC ( 1 . 5 M NaCl / 0 . 15 M Na 3 citrate ⋅ H 2 O ) . After cross - linking of the DNA via ultraviolet light ( UVStratalinker 1800 ; Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) , hybridization was performed using DIG Easy Hyb ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) accordingly to the manufacturer’s guidelines . Digoxigenin - dUTP ( DIG - dUTP ) – labeled AURKB or mEGFP probes for detection were generated using the PCR DIG Probe Synthesis Kit ( Roche ) .

Live - cell time - lapse imaging Live - cell microscopy was at 37°C in CO 2 - independent medium with - out phenol red ( Invitrogen ) . A Zeiss 780 laser scanning confocal mi - croscope with a 63 × PlanApochromat , numerical aperture ( NA ) 1 . 4 oil objective was used to acquire 512 × 512 pixel images with a pixel size of 0 . 439 μm at 5 - min intervals . The z - stacks of eight slices spaced equally through 22 . 4 μm were acquired and formed into maximum - intensity z - projections . Automatic detection of nuclei in the H2B - mCherry channel and subsequent analysis of movies for mitotic timing were with CellCognition software as described previ - ously ( Held et al . , 2010 ) . Briefly , six morphological classes were de - fined : interphase , prophase , prometaphase , metaphase , anaphase , and telophase . The training set contained > 1000 manually labeled nuclei , which were annotated with an overall accuracy of > 95 % in the cross - validation . To reduce the effect of classification errors on Volume 25 November 5 , 2014 Systematic comparison transgene methods | 3617 autofocusing , image acquisition , image analysis , and FCS . mCherry - H2B images of nuclei were thresholded on the fly in Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) such that two FCS measurement positions per cell in the cytoplasm could be specified . FCS measurements were acquired for 10 s per position , with imaging and FCS repeated at 15 min inter - vals . Cells were aligned to metaphase after data acquisition . FCS - calibrated imaging One or a few FCS measurements were performed in the cytoplasm as described in Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to extract the concentration at the respective locations . A confocal slice was then taken in the same cell with the same microscope configuration , us - ing , however , the photomultiplier detectors such that intensities were not clipped off , nor was the detector saturated . The image in - tensities were averaged locally at the FCS measurement spots and subsequently related to the measured concentration . This was per - formed for all cells , yielding a linear relationship between intensity and concentration . This linear relationship between concentration and intensity was also confirmed in a serial dilution of Alexa 488 dye in water . Images were transformed to absolute concentrations after background intensity subtraction , where background was defined as an area of the image containing no cells . The number of moles , n , in a cellular compartment was estimated using n cV = ( 3 ) where c is the molar concentration , obtained either directly from an FCS measurement in the cytoplasm or from FCS - calibrated imaging of the chromatin . V is the volume , using estimates of 750 μm 3 for DNA and 5750 μm 3 for the cytoplasm ( provided by Julius Hossain , European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Heidelberg , Germany ) in metaphase cells . The number of proteins N is related to n by Avogadro’s number , N A , N nN A = ( 4 ) Mathematical modeling For AURKB binding to chromatin , C , we assume mass - action kinetics and reversible binding according to AURKB + C ↔ AURKB - C This leads to an equation for the concentration of AURKB bound to chromatin , A C , dAdt k AC k A _ C C = − + ( 5 ) where C and A are the concentration of chromatin - binding sites and AURKB in the cytoplasm , respectively . In equilibrium and assuming conservation of chromatin , C T = A C + C , and AURKB , A T = A + A C , one obtains for the fraction of molecules bound to chromatin AA A C K A C K A C A ( ) 4 2 C T T T d T T d T T T 2 = + + − + + − ( 6 ) with the dissociation constant K d = k − / k + . The measured fraction ( A C / A T ) m also includes cytoplasmic proteins diffusing in the DNA region but not bound to DNA : AA f AA f ( 1 ) C T m C T ( ) = + − ( 7 ) where f V V V 0 . 88 t cyt cy DNA = + = ( 8 ) ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Tony Hyman and Ina Poser for donating the mouse BAC AURKB - GFP and thank all members of the Ellenberg laboratory for support .

The unknown parameters K d and C T have been fitted to the data shown in Figure 3E . The number of untagged nonfluorescent AURKB proteins is assumed to be constant in all systems and equal to one - third of the amount from homozygous knock - in cells . Therefore for cDNA and BAC cells , we assume that the total AURKB number ( tagged plus untagged ) is the sum of the measured protein number from the homozygous ZFN clone Z HZ2 plus the measured fluores - cent protein number . Immunofluorescence Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde / PBS for 5 min and permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 / 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 for 5 min . Cells were blocked in 3 % bovine serum albumin for 1 h before primary antibody incubation for 2 h at room temperature . Antibodies used were anti – Aurora B pT232 ( 1 : 2000 ; Rockland Immunochemicals , Pottstown , PA ) , anti – histone H3 pS28 ( 1 : 500 ; 10543 ; Abcam ) , and anti – histone H3 ( 1 : 500 ; 46765 ; Abcam ) .
