Consequently , it follows that the toxin is a suitable target for the development of diagnostics and therapeutics for this disease . Yet , several challenges have deterred such development . For one , the lipophilic nature of the toxin makes it difﬁcult to handle and store and contributes to variability associated with laboratory experimentation and puriﬁcation yields . In this manuscript , we have attempted to incorporate our understanding of the lipophilicity of mycolactone in order to deﬁne the optimal methods for the storage , handling , and puriﬁcation of this toxin . We present a systematic correlation of variability associated with measurement techniques ( thin - layer chromatography ( TLC ) , mass spectrometry ( MS ) , and UV - Vis spectrometry ) , storage conditions , choice of solvents , as well as the impact of each of these on toxin function as assessed by cellular cytotoxicity . We also compared natural mycolactone extracted from bacterial culture with synthesized toxins in laboratory ( solvents , buffers ) and physiologically relevant ( serum ) matrices . Our results point to the greater stability of mycolactone in organic , as well as detergent - containing , solvents , regardless of the container material ( plastic , glass , or silanized tubes ) . They also highlight the presence of toxin in samples that may be undetectable by any one technique , suggesting that each detection approach captures different conﬁgurations of the molecule with varying speciﬁcity and sensitivity . Most importantly , our results demonstrate for the very ﬁrst time that amphiphilic mycolactone associates with host lipoproteins in serum , and that this association will likely impact our ability to study , diagnose , and treat Buruli ulcers in patients . Keywords : mycolactone ; storage and handling ; amphiphilic ; lipoproteins Key Contribution : Our results demonstrate the variability of TLC , MS , and UV - Vis for the measurement of mycolactone and , for the ﬁrst time , that this toxin associates with host lipoproteins in serum , which will impact the development of diagnostic and treatment strategies for Buruli ulcers . 1 . Introduction Buruli ulcer ( BU ) infections caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans require a rapid diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic therapy at an early stage in order to prevent the devastating consequences of Toxins 2019 , 11 , 202 ; doi : 10 . 3390 / toxins11040202 www . mdpi . com / journal / toxins Toxins 2019 , 11 , 202 2 of 15 advanced ulceration . The pathogenesis of M . ulcerans is dependent on the activity of mycolactone , a plasmid - encoded polyketide - derived macrolide toxin [ 1 – 4 ] . Mycolactone is responsible for the cytotoxicity [ 5 , 6 ] , immunosuppression [ 7 ] , and painless ulcer formation [ 8 ] characteristics of BU disease . The toxin has been detected in the blood and tissue of mice [ 9 – 11 ] and patients [ 12 – 14 ] prior to ulcer formation , making mycolactone a promising biomarker for BU diagnostics . However , the unique biochemistry of this lipid - like toxin has hampered research in the host - pathogen biology of this disease , and consequently , the development of a simple point - of - care diagnostic tool . There are at least ﬁve known structural variants of mycolactone produced by closely - related mycobacteria , all of which contain a highly conserved 12 - membered lactone ring and upper side chain , as well as a variable unsaturated fatty acyl lower side chain [ 1 , 2 , 15 – 18 ] . Of these , mycolactone A / B is the most toxic form [ 19 ] . Even minor structural alterations to the lower ( termed southern side chain ) can signiﬁcantly reduce the biological activity of the toxin [ 20 – 25 ] , and this includes labeling with dye [ 20 , 21 ] and biotin [ 26 , 27 ] for use in laboratory experiments and studies . Puriﬁcation of natural mycolactone in the form of lipid extractions from bacterial culture has been performed by chloroform – methanol ( 2 : 1 v / v ) on liquid broth cultures [ 3 ] or ethanol on bacterial colonies scraped directly from agar plates [ 28 ] . Further puriﬁcation can then be done using thin - layer chromatography ( TLC ) , whereby the UV - active toxin can be separated from other lipids in the extract [ 3 , 29 , 30 ] . However , it is known that mycolactone puriﬁed from M . ulcerans ( herein referred to as natural mycolactone ) is often contaminated by unknown compounds [ 17 , 19 ] . Total chemical synthesis of mycolactone has provided a means for obtaining robust , homogenous , well - deﬁned samples with high reproducibility [ 17 , 21 , 22 , 31 , 32 ] . However , total synthesis of mycolactone is an extremely complicated process and requires substantial synthetic expertise , thus limiting the global supply of this crucial material [ 18 , 19 , 33 ] . There is evidence of variability in assay methods , handling conditions , and puriﬁcation strategies for this lipophilic toxin . Lipids stick to plastic surfaces , aggregate in aqueous solutions , and are sequestered by other lipid - containing molecules [ 34 ] . Previous work from our team and others have shown that amphiphilic biomarkers of infection are carried by host lipoproteins in the aqueous milieu of blood , and this sequestration is critical for the transport , toxicity , and pathogenicity of the organism , while inﬂuencing immune induction mechanisms as well [ 34 – 37 ] . It has been suggested that the lipid - like structure of mycolactone associates with other lipophilic molecules , such as lipid membranes [ 19 , 38 , 39 ] , and we hypothesize that lipoproteins constitute a major category of lipophilic host moieties with which mycolactone may interact . We propose that generating antibodies to mycolactone is not only challenging because of its low antigenicity [ 19 ] , but also owing to the physical interaction of mycolactone with other lipidic molecules in physiological solutions . These interactions must either be accounted for or disrupted in any detection platform in order to improve sensitivity in physiological conditions . Several investigators have explored the conditions for optimal storage and handling of mycolactone . Marion et al . provided a thorough characterization of mycolactone handling and storage conditions , showing that the toxin is sensitive to photodegradation ( 50 % reduction in toxicity after only 7 . 5 min of exposure to UV light ) and stable at high temperatures ( 100 ◦ C for 6 h ) [ 40 ] . Toxin degradation was most profound under UV - irradiation ( 254 – 365 nm ) , and to a lesser extent in sunlight and artiﬁcial light . The toxin was found to be stable under red light . Rearrangement in mycolactone chemical structure as a result of photodegradation was shown to signiﬁcantly reduce cytotoxicity [ 41 ] . Storage in glass tubes slowed the photodegradation slightly when compared to quartz tubes , while storage in amber tubes showed partial protection from UV light , and complete protection from photodegradation by natural light [ 40 ] . Mycolactone stored in ethanol was also shown to be more stable than the toxin stored in acetone , while storage in aqueous solutions was not examined . Similarly , storage of toxin - containing samples in ethanol proved crucial to the detection of mycolactone in mouse footpads by TLC [ 10 ] . Whereas these studies shed some light on optimal conditions for the storage and characterization of mycolactone , a systematic study of the impact of various solvents , Toxins 2019 , 11 , 202 3 of 15 storage conditions , and measurement techniques on the detection of mycolactone in laboratory and physiologically relevant matrices does not exist . In this manuscript , we present a systematic assessment of the impact of storage conditions ( plastic , glass , and others ) , solvents ( ethanol , water , media , and others ) , and approach ( UV - Vis , mass spectrometry ( MS ) , and TLC ) on the measurement of mycolactone A / B ( synthetic vs . natural ) , and expand the ﬁndings to assess the interaction of the lipophilic toxin with carrier moieties in host samples . Beyond highlighting the most suitable conditions for laboratory testing of mycolactone A / B , we hope to document the differential association and presentation of the toxin in serum , which is required for the better understanding of host - pathogen biology , as well as the development of diagnostic approaches . 2 . Results 2 . 1 . Puriﬁcation of Natural Mycolactone Is Inconsistent Puriﬁcation of mycolactone in the form of an acetone - soluble lipid extract from M . ulcerans bacterial culture is routinely performed in the laboratory [ 3 ] . Further puriﬁcation by TLC is used to separate the UV - active toxin from other lipids found in the bacterial extract [ 3 ] , followed by characterization using MS [ 2 ] . In order to understand the batch - to - batch variability of natural mycolactone samples , we puriﬁed 12 independent bacterial extracts by TLC using standard methods [ 3 ] and then characterized these extracts by MS , UV - Vis , and cytotoxicity ( Table 1 , Figure 1 ) . Bacteria were grown on agar plates from which colonies were scraped and then puriﬁed using an ethanol extraction method [ 28 ] . Four out of twelve samples did not display a UV - active band by TLC ( samples 2 , 4 , 6 , and 10 ) . For sample 2 , this was thought to be due to a low starting dry weight ( 0 . 027 g ) of bacteria used in the extraction , resulting in mycolactone levels below the limit of detection by TLC . However , for sample 4 , the starting dry weight of bacteria ( 0 . 250 g ) was similar or greater to that of other samples that yielded detectable concentrations of mycolactone ( 0 . 218 g , sample 1 ) . For samples 6 and 10 , in the absence of a UV - active band , the area on the TLC plate corresponding with the synthetic mycolactone positive control spot was excised and puriﬁed for further analysis . This was not done with samples 2 and 4 , therefore there is no corresponding MS or UV - Vis data for these two samples . Interestingly , mycolactone was detected by UV - Vis in all 10 samples tested ( including 6 and 10 ) , and by MS in 9 out of 10 samples , with sample 6 being the exception ( Table 1 , Data Set S1 ) . Thus , MS and / or UV - Vis demonstrated presence of the toxin even in extracts where no UV - active band was noticeable by TLC , questioning the use of TLC as a catch - all triage method for identiﬁcation of the toxin .

The mycolactone toxin ( a ) consists of a highly conserved 12 - membered lactone ring , an invariable upper side chain , and an unsaturated fatty acyl lower side chain . ( b ) Cytotoxicity of natural mycolactone puriﬁed from M . ulcerans was measured using the L - 929 mouse ﬁbroblast cell line . Mycolactone concentration was normalized to 40 ng / mL for all samples as determined by UV absorption ( λ max = 362 nm , log ε = 4 . 29 ) . Initial sample concentrations are shown in Table 1 . The dotted line indicates cytotoxicity of synthetic mycolactone A / B for comparison . Statistical signiﬁcance comparing the cytotoxicity of natural mycolactone samples to synthetic mycolactone A / B was determined by Students t - test ( * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * P < 0 . 01 , * P < 0 . 05 ) . In order to determine if the toxin observed by all three methods was biologically active , we assessed the extracts for cytotoxicity in a mammalian cell system . Mycolactone concentration was normalized to 40 ng / mL for all samples as determined by UV absorption ( λ max = 362 nm , log ε = 4 . 29 ) [ 29 ] . We observed high variability in the biological activity of the resulting puriﬁed natural mycolactone samples ( Figure 1b ) . Only 4 samples ( 1 , 3 , 8 , and 9 ) showed levels of cytotoxicity in L - 929 mouse ﬁbroblasts that were similar to synthetic mycolactone A / B . The other 6 samples tested displayed signiﬁcantly reduced cytotoxicity [ 29 ] . Samples 6 and 10 , which did not show a UV - active TLC band , did not display cytotoxicity and were not signiﬁcantly different from the negative control ( P = 0 . 42 and P = 0 . 10 , respectively ) despite the presence of mycolactone in MS ( sample 10 ) and UV - Vis ( samples 6 and 10 ) . These results indicate an inherent discrepancy between TLC , MS , and UV - Vis methods for detecting bioactive mycolactone A / B . One interesting observation was that the MS proﬁles of the ethanol extracts prior to TLC puriﬁcation were very similar to synthetic mycolactone A / B ( Figure 2a , b ) . These results indicate the absence of other lipids , at least of those that can be measured under these MS conditions ( with a high desolvation temperature of 550 ◦ C ) , and thereby questions the need for TLC - puriﬁcation to remove other lipid contaminants in bacterial extracts . In fact , TLC - puriﬁcation greatly reduced the mycolactone 765 m / z peak to near background levels ( acetonitrile blank spectra are included in Data Set S1 ) , while increasing the m / z peaks of mycolactone co - metabolites at 429 and 781 [ 42 ] ( Figure 2c ) , which was seen in all samples tested ( Data Set S1 ) . The presence of contaminants is more obvious in samples where the mycolactone concentration is low . Figure 2 demonstrates that the MS proﬁle derived from the ethanol extract of the toxin , without puriﬁcation by TLC , is similar to that of synthetic mycolactone . However , following TLC puriﬁcation , the mycolactone concentration is greatly reduced and the other background contaminants and co - metabolites are more visible . These results question the need for TLC puriﬁcation of natural mycolactone A / B stocks used for research purposes . The bacterial culture and puriﬁcation process are time - consuming , and TLC appears to greatly reduce the total amount of intact toxin recovered . One reason for this discrepancy is likely the amphiphilic biochemistry of the toxin leading to its association with other lipid - containing molecules , which impacts its recovery from complex biological samples , such as bacterial culture .

Mycolactone Forms Aggregates in Aqueous Solution Since mycolactone is an amphiphilic molecule ( Figure 1a ) , it has low solubility in aqueous media , causing it to either aggregate , associate with other lipids , or stick to materials like plastic . All of these associations impact measurement of the toxin . In order to understand the behavior of the toxin in aqueous media , we ﬁrst measured the critical micelle concentration ( CMC ) of this molecule , which is the concentration at which it forms aggregates in solution [ 43 ] . We found that mycolactone A / B forms aggregates in water at room temperature at a concentration of 30 – 60 µ M ( Table 2 ) . The addition of a biotin label on the southern chain of the toxin reduces this concentration by 30 - fold , thus biotinylated mycolactone A / B will form aggregates at 1 – 2 µ M concentrations . This change in its biochemical properties will alter the way biotinylated mycolactone interacts with other lipid and amphiphilic molecules , including cell membranes , and should be taken into consideration in studies using this modiﬁed form of the toxin in research . We speculate that common laboratory methods for labeling and characterizing amphiphiles changes their biochemical behavior , resulting in observations that often lack relevance in physiological conditions . The CMC of mycolactone will vary based on the temperature and complexity of the media in which it is present . The main goal of this experiment was to highlight that modiﬁcation to the toxin and the experimental design will impact the behavior of this lipophile , and that can induce variability in our measurements and impact the understanding of its involvement in pathogenesis .

Storage Media , but not Container Material , Affect Mycolactone Measurement by UV - Vis We set out to determine the effect of media conditions and storage containers on the ability to measure mycolactone A / B over time . Due to the low yield of mycolactone in a single bacterial extract , synthetic mycolactone samples were used for testing of media condition and container storage conditions . The conditions chosen were those found to be relevant for storage of patient samples including water , ethanol , and culture media [ 44 ] . In this experiment , mycolactone A / B was diluted to the same concentration in each of the four test media conditions in a glass vial , and then samples were aliquoted in either plastic polypropylene microfuge tubes , siliconized low - retention microfuge tubes , or other glass vials for comparative evaluation . The samples were stored at room temperature , protected from light , and absorbance measurements at 362 nm were taken over time ( from 10 min to 24 h ) to determine mycolactone concentration . Interestingly , the storage container made little difference in the absorbance of mycolactone measured at any given time . However , the media conditions had a tremendous impact on mycolactone concentration as measured by UV - Vis ( Figure 3 ) .

Samples were stored at room temperature and protected from light until measurements of absorbance at 362 nm were taken at various time points up to 24 hours using 2 µL on a NanoDrop™ ND - 1000 spectrophotometer ( n = 3 ) . Each measurement was blanked using the respective media condition without mycolactone prior to measuring the samples containing mycolactone . Values plotted are mean absorbance at 362 nm  standard deviation . All experiments were repeated twice . Samples stored in water showed nearly undetectable levels of mycolactone in as little as 10 min regardless of container material ( Figure 3a ) , suggesting aggregation of the toxin in aqueous matrices . However , samples stored in 100 % ethanol showed consistent mycolactone concentration measurements across all time points , up to 24 hours , and in all storage container materials tested ( Figure 3b ) . Furthermore , we found that greater than 25 % ethanol is required to observe mycolactone concentrations above those seen in PBS alone ( Figure 4a ) . Interestingly , adding sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , a known surfactant and amphiphilic molecule , to water at concentrations as low as 1 mM significantly increases the mycolactone measured ( Figure 4b ) . Therefore , aqueous solutions can be used to store mycolactone as long as a surfactant , such as SDS , is present . Samples stored in cell culture media ( EMEM ) containing 10 % horse serum ( as is typical for most media preparations ) displayed highly inconsistent results , making mycolactone quantification very difficult ( Figure 3c ) .

Mycolactone A / B Binds to Human High - and Low - Density Lipoproteins ( HDL and LDL ) Previous work from our laboratory and others has demonstrated a role for human lipoproteins , HDL and LDL , in trafficking lipid - containing molecules in blood [ 34 – 37 ] . It is known that HDL and LDL play a role in transporting bacterial biomarkers , such as lipopolysaccharide from gram - negative bacteria , lipoteichoic acid from gram - positive bacteria , and lipoarabinomannan from gram - indeterminate bacteria [ 35 , 45 – 47 ] . In fact , HDL is currently being evaluated as a therapeutic for endotoxic shock since it sequesters LPS in blood [ 46 , 48 ] . We wanted to determine whether HDL and LDL also binds mycolactone , which may have significant diagnostic and therapeutic implications . Normal HDL and LDL concentrations in healthy adults are > 0 . 4 mg / mL and < 1 mg / mL respectively [ 49 ] , so we started our tests using lipoproteins diluted to 0 . 5 mg / mL . Mycolactone was added to these lipoprotein preparations , and the samples were incubated at room temperature and protected from light with absorbance measurements at 362 nm taken over time as before . As compared to mycolactone in PBS , mycolactone absorbance significantly increased in the presence of HDL in as little as 10 minutes and remained over the course of 24 hours ( Figure 5a ) . We attribute this behavior to the rapid sequestration of mycolactone by HDL . In contrast , mycolactone absorbance only increased significantly after 1 hour in the presence of LDL ( Figure 5b ) , indicating a slower sequestration rate of mycolactone by LDL . These results , along with our measurements in EMEM containing whole serum , show differential rates of binding to various lipophilic molecules in serum .

Discussion Mycolactone produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans is a major diagnostic and therapeutic target for Buruli ulcer . In this study , we characterized the toxin from a biochemical perspective , appreciating its amphiphilicity and speculating on the consequent impact and interactions in aqueous milieu . Expanding on work from other investigators , we deﬁned preferred conditions for the storage , Toxins 2019 , 11 , 202 10 of 15 puriﬁcation , and handling of the toxin , highlighting the discrepancy between various detection methods in their ability to accurately measure mycolactone concentration . CMC measurements indicate that natural mycolactone is likely to behave very differently from modiﬁed ( e . g . , biotinylated ) toxin , and that these variabilities should be considered in the design of experiments . Ethanol or a surfactant like SDS can be used to solubilize the toxin in aqueous media in order to enhance its detection by UV - Vis . On the other hand , the storage container material ( glass , plastic , or siliconized plastic ) proved to have little impact on mycolactone recovery under the conditions tested . Most signiﬁcantly , our results demonstrate that lipophilic mycolactone associates with host lipoproteins in human serum and may be present in this sequestered form in physiologically relevant samples . This observation is also supported by the fact that we are unable to measure the toxin in media without serum or lipoproteins . These results help to explain the difﬁculty in generating antibodies against mycolactone as it is most likely presented in a sequestered form with other lipophilic molecules , including lipoproteins , and other host - derived assemblies [ 19 , 38 , 39 ] . Amphiphiles are extremely common in biological systems . Most conserved bacterial signatures , those routinely recognized by the host innate immune system ( i . e . , lipopolysaccharides , lipoteichoic acids , lipoarabinomannans ) , are amphiphilic in nature . Previous work from our group has shown that these molecules associate with host lipoproteins , which not only impacts their availability for detection but also directly affects the induction of innate immune signaling [ 34 – 37 ] . Yet , little consideration is often given to the biochemistry and physiological presentation of these moieties when measurements are taken . These associations may be used to develop schemes for the direct detection of mycolactone in serum , using lipoproteins as a means for capturing and concentrating the toxin , a strategy developed by our team termed lipoprotein capture [ 35 ] . Further characterization of the interactions between the toxin and host lipoproteins , such as HDL and LDL , will be crucial in order to achieve the level of sensitivity required in a clinical diagnostic tool . These studies indicate the signiﬁcance of amphiphilic biomolecules on host - pathogen interactions and associated pathogenesis , and the need for further study of mycolactone speciﬁcally . Incorporating the biochemical properties of the molecule in question is critical to an accurate understanding of pathogenesis , and for the development of physiologically relevant diagnostic approaches . In this manuscript , we present new insights into the characterization of amphiphilic mycolactone . Our ﬁndings indicate the need for more reliable standards and puriﬁcation methods , and speciﬁcally call for broader efforts to synthesize the toxin for consistency in research and development . 4 . Materials and Methods 4 . 1 . Materials and Reagents Synthetic mycolactone A / B was a kind gift of Professor Yoshito Kishi ( Harvard University , Cambridge , MA , USA ) and biotinylated mycolactone was a kind gift of Dr . Caroline Demangel ( Pasteur Institute , Paris , France ) . Natural mycolactone was obtained from M . ulcerans bacterial culture ( strains 1615 or 1059 ) . Mycolactone concentrations were quantiﬁed by UV - Vis spectrophotometry as described previously ( λ max = 362 nm ; log ε = 4 . 29 ) [ 29 ] . Puriﬁed human high - and low - density lipoproteins ( HDL and LDL , respectively ) were purchased from Bio - Rad ( catalog no . 5685 - 2004 and 5685 - 3204 ) , resuspended in ﬁlter - sterilized nanopure water , and stored at 4 ◦ C until use . 4 . 2 . Natural Mycolactone Puriﬁcation M . ulcerans strains 1615 [ 50 ] and 1059 [ 51 ] were kindly provided by Dr . Pamela Small , University of Tennessee . M . ulcerans 1059AL is an autoluminescent derivative of strain 1059 [ 52 ] . Bacterial strains were grown on selective Middlebrook 7H11 agar . Colonies from 2 or 3 conﬂuent plates were scraped into a pre - weighed Eppendorf tube and weighed . The material was then put in a foil - wrapped 125 mL glass ﬂask with 10 mL absolute EtOH and stirred for 2 h at room temperature . Using a Pasteur pipette , the dissolved or suspended material was transferred to a pair of glass centrifuge Toxins 2019 , 11 , 202 11 of 15 tubes , the tops were crimped , and the tubes were spun at ~ 3000 rpm for 20 min at 4 ◦ C . The ethanol phase was collected into a 25 or 50 mL round bottom glass ﬂask and dried under nitrogen with heat set between 50 – 60 ◦ C . The residue was resuspended in 200 – 300 µ L of absolute EtOH and stored at − 20 ◦ C . Thin - layer chromatography ( TLC ) was performed as previously described [ 2 ] . Brieﬂy , ethanol extracts from M . ulcerans were applied to a silica TLC plate and after drying , mobilized using chloroform : methanol : water ( 90 : 10 : 1 v / v / v ) as a solvent system . Mycolactone - containing lipids were extracted as a light - yellow band following visualization under UV light , resuspended in absolute ethanol , and stored in amber glass vials at − 20 ◦ C until use . 4 . 3 . Electron Spray Ionization Mass Spectrometry ( MS ) Ethanol extracts were diluted in acetonitrile and directly perfused into an electrospray ionization source on a Waters Synapt G2S mass spectrometer . The MS conditions were initially optimized to erythromycin , as well as a synthetic mycolactone standard before applying them to the ethanol extracts . The MS conditions were : ﬂow rate 50 µ L / min over a 2 min period ; capillary voltage 2 . 98 kV ; cone voltage 75 V ; desolvation temperature 550 ◦ C ; desolvation gas 945 L / h ; source temperature 150 ◦ C ; acquisition range 100 – 2000 m / z . Mycolactone A / B was detected by the presence of the more abundant sodium adduct [ M + Na ] + ( m / z 765 . 5 ) ; the protonated molecular ion [ M + H ] + ( m / z 743 . 5 ) , and the dehydrated protonated molecular ion [ M + H − H 2 O ] + ( m / z 725 . 5 ) as described previously [ 2 ] . 4 . 4 . Cytotoxicity Assays L929 mouse ﬁbroblasts ( ATCC CCL - 1 ) were purchased from the American type culture collection and maintained in Eagle’s minimum essential medium ( Corning , 10009CV ) with 10 % horse serum ( Sigma - Aldrich , H1270 - 500ML ) in tissue culture ﬂasks and incubated in 5 % CO 2 at 37 ◦ C . In this manuscript , Eagle’s minimum essential medium containing 10 % horse serum is referred to as “EMEM” , while media without serum is called “EMEM no serum” . Cells were passaged at least 3 times prior to use in cytotoxicity experiments . 24 - well tissue culture plates were seeded with 5 × 10 4 cells per well and allowed to adhere overnight . Medium was discarded and replaced with 500 µ L of fresh EMEM containing the desired concentration of mycolactone . Mycolactone dilutions in EMEM were performed in glass test tubes protected from light . After 48 h of incubation , cytotoxicity was measured using the resazurin - based reagent PrestoBlue™ ( A13262 , Invitrogen ) by adding 50 µ L of reagent and incubating at 37 ◦ C for 60 min . Measurements were taken using a SpectraMax Gemini EM plate reader ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) with excitation at 560 nm and emission at 590 nm . Relative ﬂuorescence values plotted are the mean ± standard deviation ( n = 4 replicate wells ) . 4 . 5 . Mycolactone Quantiﬁcation by UV - Vis Synthetic mycolactone A / B stocks at 0 . 2 mg / mL or 0 . 1 mg / mL in acetonitrile were diluted 1 : 20 or 1 : 10 ( respectively ) in the desired test media condition in a glass vial and then subdivided into a total of 3 glass vials ( National Scientiﬁc , C5000 - 995 ) , 3 plastic tubes ( Fisher Scientiﬁc , 05 - 408 - 137 ) , and 3 siliconized low - retention plastic tubes ( Fisher Scientiﬁc , 02 - 681 - 320 ) for each test condition ( technical triplicates ) . Samples were then incubated at room temperature protected from light . At various time points ranging from 10 min to 24 h , quantiﬁcation of mycolactone by UV - Vis absorption at 362 nm was performed using a NanoDrop™ ND - 1000 spectrophotometer ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . Measurements were taken using 2 µ L of each sample . Blanks prior to each measurement were performed using the appropriate media conditions in the absence of mycolactone . In the case of HDL and LDL , absorbance of lipoprotein ( at the indicated concentration ) in the absence of mycolactone was subtracted from the value given for each lipoprotein sample containing mycolactone [ Abs 362 with mycolactone − Abs 362 no mycolactone ] . Experiments were performed at least twice . Values plotted are the mean absorbance values at 362 nm ± standard deviation . Toxins 2019 , 11 , 202 12 of 15 4 . 6 . Critical Micelle Concentration ( CMC ) The CMC of mycolactone A / B was determined using the detergent critical micelle concentration ( CMC ) assay kit ( ProFoldin , CMC1000 ) as per the manufacturer’s instructions . Brieﬂy , synthetic ( 1 mg / mL stock in ethyl acetate ) or biotinylated mycolactone ( 1 . 125 mg / mL stock in ethanol ) was diluted in ﬁlter - sterilized nanopure water in 2 - fold dilutions ranging from 60 – 0 . 03 µ M , including a “no mycolactone” negative control in 50 µ L volumes in duplicate . Then 50 µ L of 1X CMC dye ( also diluted in water ) was added to each sample , bringing the ﬁnal mycolactone concentration to 1X at 30 – 0 . 015 µ M . The samples were incubated at room temperature and protected from light for 30 min . The ﬂuorescence was measured using a SpectraMax Gemini EM plate reader ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 465 nm . When in monomeric form , there will be little to no change in ﬂuorescent signal as compared to the negative control . Once the CMC is reached , aggregation will occur , and dye will be incorporated within the micelle resulting in an increased ﬂuorescent emission at 465 nm . Thus , the measured ﬂuorescence values for each mycolactone concentration were divided by the value of the negative control signal to yield normalized ﬂuorescence values ( n = 2 ) . In monomeric form , the normalized ﬂuorescent value will equal 1 . Therefore , a normalized value greater than 1 indicates micelle formation , which was identiﬁed by testing for statistical signiﬁcance ( Student’s t - test , P < 0 . 05 ) pairwise between samples of 2 - fold increasing concentrations of mycolactone . The CMC was deﬁned as the 2 - fold concentration range in which a statistically signiﬁcant increase in normalized ﬂuorescence units ﬁrst appears . Experiments were performed twice . 4 . 7 . Statistical Analysis Absorbance values are plotted as means ± standard deviation . Data were analyzed using Students t - test to determine statistical signiﬁcance between individual groups . A signiﬁcance level ( P ) of less than 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant ( * * * P < 0 . 001 , * * P < 0 . 01 , or * P < 0 . 05 ) .
