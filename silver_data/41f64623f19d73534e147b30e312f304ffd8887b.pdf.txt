Current consensus is that marine microbes account for this produc - tion , given their possession of key enzymes including methyl - end ( or “ w x ” ) desaturases . w x desaturases have also been described in a small number of invertebrate animals , but their precise distribution has not been systematically explored . This study identifies 121 w x desaturase sequences from 80 species within the Cnidaria , Rotifera , Mollusca , Annelida , and Arthropoda .

INTRODUCTION Marineecosystemsareresponsibleforvirtuallyallnaturalproductionofomega - 3 ( w 3 ) long - chain ( ≥ C 20 ) polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) , which are essential dietary components for vertebrates that are required for neural development and health promotion while also having bene - ficialrolesacrossavarietyofhumanpathologiesanddisorders ( 1 ) . With an expected increased demand for w 3 oil supplements prescribed for prevalent cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases in humans ( 1 ) , there is intense interest in exploring novel sources of w 3 oils ( 2 , 3 ) . The current dogma is that photosynthetic marine microalgae , hetero - trophic protists , and bacteria account for natural w 3 long - chain PUFA production ( 4 – 6 ) , because they have all the enzymatic components nec - essary for de novo synthesis , unlike higher trophic organisms such as fish . Plants have the ability for de novo synthesis of PUFA of up to 18 carbons but limited elongation capacity to produce long - chain PUFA ( 7 ) . Although some bacteria and lower eukaryotes can produce PUFA de novo via a polyketide synthase pathway ( 6 ) , PUFA bio - synthesis in most aquatic microbes requires fatty acid ( FA ) desaturases that catalyze the insertion of new double bonds ( unsaturations ) ( 8 , 9 ) . D 9 desaturases mediate the insertion of the first unsaturation in stearic acid ( 18 : 0 ) to produce oleic acid ( 18 : 1 w 9 ) . Insertion of further unsatura - tions is achieved through sequential reactions driven by methyl - end ( or “ w x ” ) desaturases that introduce a double bond between an existing un - saturationand themethylendofthefattyacid ( 8 ) . Thus , theactionofan w 6 ( or D 12 ) desaturase enables the conversion of 18 : 1 w 9 to 18 : 2 w 6 [ li - noleic acid ( LA ) ] , the latter acting as an intermediate metabolite in de novo w 3 PUFA biosynthesis because it is subsequently converted to 18 : 3 w 3 [ a - linolenic acid ( ALA ) ] by an w 3 ( or D 15 ) desaturase ( 4 , 5 ) . Al - though D 9 desaturases are present in virtually all organisms ( 8 ) , de novo w 3 PUFA production is only possible if both D 12 and D 15 desaturases coexist within an organism . Vertebrates lackthe w x desaturasesnecessaryfor PUFA biosynthesis and thus require dietary LA and ALA to satisfy essential FA require - ments ( 9 , 10 ) . The same condition has been largely accepted for all animals , with few exceptions reported . Two pulmonate molluscs ( 11 ) and some insects ( 12 , 13 ) showed the ability to biosynthesize LA , but not ALA . Recently , the deep - sea tubeworm Riftia pachyptila ( Annelida ) has been shown to have an w 3 desaturase enabling the biosynthesis of ALA but not LA ( 14 ) . Currently , only two terrestrial metazoans , the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ( 15 – 17 ) and the arthropod Bemisia argentifolii ( 18 ) , have been reported to have w x desaturases with both D 12 and D 15 activities . If , contrary to current consensus , these few in - stances of metazoan w x desaturases , in fact , reflect a prevalent occur - rence of these enzymes across animals , then a major revision of our understanding of w 3 PUFA production in global food webs is required . The present study provides a comprehensive search of available se - quence databases and analysis of the distribution of w x desaturase genes across the Metazoa . We establish that , contrary to common perception , w x desaturases are widely distributed across animal phyla . Furthermore , selected w xdesaturasegenesfromkeylineageswithwidespreadoccurrence in aquatic ecosystems , namely , Cnidaria ( Acropora millepora ) , Rotifera ( Adineta vaga ) , Mollusca ( Patella vulgata ) , Annelida ( Platynereis dumerilii ) , and Arthropoda ( Lepeophtheirus salmonis ) , were function - ally characterized to clarify their role in PUFA biosynthesis . Our results demonstrate that multiple invertebrates can actively produce w 3 PUFA de novo . Moreover , we also establish additional desaturase capabilities in animal w x desaturases that enable the biosynthesis of physiologically essential w 3 long - chain PUFA . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Our search for w x desaturase – like sequences showed the presence of these genes in both prokaryotes ( Cyanobacteria ) and eukaryotes includ - ing Archaeplastida ( red and green algae , Viridiplantae ) , Excavata , SAR ( stramenopiles , alveolates , and Rhizaria ) , Amoebozoa , Haptophyceae , Apusozoa , Heterolobosea , Cryptophyta , and Opisthokonta ( divided into Fungi , Metazoa , and other Opisthokonta ) ( Fig . 1 and fig .

Se - quences with homology to w x desaturases were retrieved from thephyla Cnidaria , Rotifera , Mollusca , Annelida , Arthropoda , and Nematoda . Overall , 121 w x desaturase sequences from 80 animal species were iden - tified ( Fig . 1 ) . A list of all genomes and transcriptomes searched , includ - ing those in which no w x desaturase genes were found , can be accessed as described in the Data and materials availability section , below . Phylogenetic analysis using all recovered metazoan sequences , along with a representative subset of sequences from the remaining non - metazoan groups , revealed at least three distinct w x desaturase gene lineages ( clades 1 to 3 in Fig . 1 ) in animals ; most likely , these have in - dependent evolutionary origins , because they do not form a single monophyletic animal clade . Clade 1 was composed exclusively of se - quences from nematodes , including two C . elegans w x desaturases ( 15 – 17 ) , with an outgroup of nonmetazoan genes ( for example , micro - algae , a fungus , and an alveolate ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Clade 2 comprised two dis - tinct gene lineages in Cnidaria ( Fig . 1 ) , with sequences from stony corals , coral anemones , sea anemones , and zoanthids . The cnidarian se - quences ( clade 2 ) were nested within a broad and well - supported clade that included most of the eukaryotic nonmetazoan sequences of the data set , but the specific sister group to clade 2 was not well resolved ( Fig . 1 ) . Clade 3 included sequences from Lophotrochozoa ( namely , Rotifera , Mollusca , andAnnelida ) andnonnematodeEcdysozoa ( copepod arthropods ) . Oomycota sequences formed a well - resolved sister group to the clade 3 animal genes ( Fig . 1 ) . As in clade 2 , there were frequently two genes in most clade 3 species . Beyond clades 1 to 3 , three smaller sets of animal sequences from the arthropods Bemisia tabaci ( Hemiptera ) , Locusta migratoria ( Orthoptera ) , and Sminthurus viridis ( Collembola ) appeared scattered in the tree ( Fig . 1 ) . The division of most metazoan sequences into three main clades is also consistent with the amino acid compositions of the three histidine box motifs ( H - box1 – 3 ) typical of desaturases ( fig . S2 ) ( 19 ) . A B x Fig . 1 . Distributionof w xdesaturases . ( A ) Acondensedphylogenetictreedepictingrelationshipsamong w xdesaturasesfromCyanobacteria ( 8 ) andEukaryota ( 279 ) .

For example , several w x desaturase – like sequences from the silverleaf whitefly , B . tabaci , are most closely related to one of the Viridiplantae w x desaturase clades in the phylogeny ( Fig . 1 and fig . S1 ) , which includes FAD2 plant desaturases functionally character - ized as D 12 desaturases ( 20 ) . To exclude the possibility that these se - quences might represent plant sequence contamination in B . tabaci , we examined the genomic neighborhoods of B . tabaci w x desaturases . The B . tabaci sequences are genome - anchored and distributed across five different scaffolds ( Fig . 2A ) . B . tabaci w x desaturase sequences are flanked by genes that have clear orthologs in other metazoans ( Fig . 2A ) . This genomic arrangement implies that the B . tabaci w x desaturase se - quences are bona fide components of the whitefly genome . Thus , HGT likely accounts for the occurrence of w x desaturases in B . tabaci , with the genes possibly transferring from plants on which this whitefly feeds . Fur - ther cases of HGT appear to exist in a locust and a collembolan . Collem - bola have w x desaturase sequences that are most closely related to sequences from Oomycota species that are plant pathogens , which are presumably prevalent in the soil habitat occupied by collembolans . Our data thus indicate that the described ability of some collembolans to syn - thesizeLAisduetoanendogenouscapacityderivedfrom the presence of w x desaturases in this hexapod and not to any associated microbes ( 21 ) . Furthermore , HGT has been suggested for the Fat - 1 and Fat - 2 NW _ 017547298 NW _ 017547192 NW _ 017549038 NW _ 017550922 NW _ 017566817 A : B . tabaci x desaturase - like : Animal gene B Cnidaria A . millepora KY658236 A . millepora KY658237 A . digitifera XP _ 015765263 O . faveolata XP _ 020605190 O . faveolata XP _ 020612965 N . vectensis HADN01045545 P . dumerilii KY707886 P . dumerilii KY658238 C . teleta ELU01782 H . robusta ESO11545 Annelida P . vulgata KY658241 P . vulgata KY658242 L . gigantea ESO96191 L . gigantea ESO85881 Mollusca C . tribblei LFLW010086926 C . tribblei LFLW010126648 L . stagnalis FX184521 L . stagnalis FCFB01106383 R . auricularia MUZC01000057 R . auricularia MUZC01000242 B . glabrata XP _ 013078984 O . bimaculoides KOF99091 O . bimaculoides KOF62429 Patellogastropoda Caenogastropoda Heterobranchia Cephalopoda L . salmonis KY658239 L . salmonis KY658240 T . californicus GBTC01004759 T . californicus JW524768 Arthropoda A . vaga MF448337 A . vaga MF448338 A . vaga MF448339 Rotifera C . elegans NP _ 001023560 C . elegans CAB05304 A . ceylanicum EYC13544 N . americanus ETN74529 Nematoda Fig . 2 .

More generally , HGT between closely associated organisms has been established previously ( 23 , 24 ) , whereas other desa - turase genes have been demonstrated to have arisen via HGT in arthro - pods , such as the two - spotted spider mite , Tetranychus urticae ( 25 ) . Therefore , although additional evolutionary processes are also likely to be affecting metazoan w x desaturase genes , it is reasonable to sup - pose that HGT could account for multiple w x desaturases in metazo - ans . HGT is a particularly plausible scenario for aquatic invertebrates that are in direct contact with single - cell primary producers ( 6 ) . Also consistent with this hypothesis is the fact that many of the w x desaturase sequences from Cnidaria , Mollusca , Annelida , and Arthropoda are intronless genes ( Fig . 2B ) , a feature suggesting a gene origin via RNA retrotransposition - mediated HGT ( 26 ) . Having established that w x desaturase sequences are phylogenetical - ly widespread across the Metazoa , it was a central aim to confirm that these genes are capable of de novo w 3 PUFA biosynthesis . Using a yeast heterologous expression system , we investigated the functions of two dis - tinct w x desaturases for each of five representative species of selected metazoan lineages including Cnidaria ( A . millepora ) , Rotifera ( A . vaga ) , Mollusca ( P . vulgata ) , Annelida ( P . dumerilii ) , andArthropoda ( L . salmonis ) ( Fig . 3 and Tables 1 and 2 ) . With the exception of A . vaga , a fairly consistent pattern of w x desaturase capabilities was found among repre - sentatives of Cnidaria , Mollusca , Annelida , and Arthropoda . Thus , one gene from the pair of w x desaturases in each species exhibited D 12 de - saturaseactivity , enablingthebiosynthesisof18 : 2 w 6 ( Fig . 3BandTable1 ) . The second w x desaturase of each pair exhibited D 15 desaturation ability , being able to convert 18 : 2 w 6 to 18 : 3 w 3 ( ALA ) ( Fig . 3 and Table 2 ) and A 18 : 1 9 18 : 2 6 18 : 3 6 20 : 3 6 20 : 4 6 22 : 4 6 18 : 3 3 18 : 4 3 20 : 4 3 20 : 5 3 22 : 5 3 15 3des 15 3des 17 3des 17 3des 19 3des 12 6des 20 : 2 6 20 : 3 3 3des 17 Front - end desaturase Elongase C 18 : 2 6 18 : 3 3 16 : 0 16 : 1 7 18 : 1 9 18 : 0 15 25 20 15 25 20 30 35 40 45 50 20 : 4 6 ( A R A ) 20 : 5 3 ( EPA ) 18 : 1 9 18 : 0 16 : 0 16 : 1 7 18 : 1 9 18 : 0 22 : 4 6 22 : 5 3 15 25 20 30 35 16 : 1 7 16 : 0 Retention ( min ) B 18 : 1 9 15 20 18 19 21 22 23 24 16 17 18 : 2 6 18 : 3 3 18 : 0 16 : 0 16 : 1 7 16 : 2 4 16 : 3 1 Control Retention ( min ) 15 19 17 Fig . 3 .

Both LA ( 18 : 2 w 6 ) and ALA ( 18 : 3 w 3 ) can be subsequently modified through the w 6 and w 3 long - chain PUFA biosynthesis pathways that proceed separately , at least in vertebrates ( 9 ) , or can be interconnected by w 3 desaturases with D 15 , D 17 , or D 19 activities ( green arrows ) .

The capability for de novo biosynthesis of w 3 PUFA through the combined action of two distinct enzymes in represen - tatives of Cnidaria , Mollusca , Annelida , and Arthropoda was also con - tained within each of the two w x desaturases characterized from the rotifer A . vaga ( Fig . 3 and Table 2 ) . Our results contradict the currently accepted paradigm ( 6 , 9 , 27 ) because they show unequivocally that both D 12 and D 15 desaturase activities are present in multiple metazoans , enabling them to endogenously produce w 3 PUFA de novo . The yeast systemused inthisstudythusconfirmsthattheenzymeactivities reported in in vivo experiments are due to endogenous metazoan genes and not microbes ( 28 , 29 ) . One of the w x desaturases described in cnidarians , mol - luscs , annelids , and crustaceans was able to produce a variety of w 3 long - chain PUFA from their corresponding w 6 precursors ( Table 2 ) , in addi - tionto18 : 3 w 3 , confirmingthattheseenzymesaretrue w 3desaturaseswith coexisting D 15 , D 17 , and D 19activities . Thisrepresentslong - chainPUFA – synthesizing capabilities previously unknown outside microbes ( 5 , 14 , 15 ) . The present study shows that rather than merely converting dietary PUFA [ like the “ trophic upgrading ” done by fish ( 30 ) ] , aquatic inverte - bratescannow be recognized as net producers of w 3long - chainPUFA in agreement with studies ( 29 ) , providing much more widespread bio - synthesisofthesecompoundsinthemarineenvironmentthanpreviouslyappreciated . Consequently , models that estimate global production of w 3 long - chain PUFA , which are largely constructed on the assumption that single - cellmicroorganismsarethesoleprimaryproducers , needextensive revision ( 27 , 31 ) . w 3 long - chain PUFA production by metazoans will un - doubtedly be significant due to the abundance that the animals that are now known to have w x desaturases have in global ecosystems .

Specifically , we conducted an extensive search of genomic and transcriptomic resources covering species from all do - mains of life , with a particular focus on Metazoa . Given the vast taxo - nomic and genetic variability of the “ w x desaturases ” ( 8 ) , homologous sequences were collected by applying similar but complementary meth - odologies , including HMMER , PSI - BLAST , and HHblits . Query se - quences consisted of 113 representative prokaryotic and eukaryotic w x desaturase protein sequences ( 19 ) . First , the query sequences were aligned with hmmalign ( HMMER software v3 . 1b2 , hmmer . org ) to the Pfam Fatty Acid Desaturase Family Profile ( FA _ desaturase PF00487 . 22 ) . The resultant multiple sequence alignment ( MSA ) was then used to search for similar sequences through the HHMER3 web server ( https : / / toolkit . tuebingen . mpg . de / # / tools / hmmer ) ( 32 ) against the nonredundant GenBank protein database ( nr , E - value < 1 × 10 − 10 ) . Using this ap - proach , around 14 , 000 distinct hits were collected . Second , the MSA was used to build a position - specific scoring matrix for a PSI - BLAST search ( v . 2 . 6 . 0 + ; E - value < 1 × 10 − 10 , 11 iterations ) against the nr database . In total , this search retrieved around 56 , 000 sequences . Third , the query sequences were used as input in a Homology detection by iterative HMM - HMM comparison ( HHblits ) ( 33 ) against the UniProt20 HMM database using the following nondefault options : maximum num - ber of iterations = 8 and realign query - template alignments with Maxi - mum Accuracy alignment algorithm ( threshold ≥ 0 . 1 ) . With HHblits , a total of 520 hits were collected . Finally , all hits were combined and dupli - cates were removed , resulting in an initial data set of 58 , 000 sequences . Filtering out false - positive and incomplete w x desaturase gene sequences FA desaturase sequences are characterized by the presence of three conserved histidine box motifs ( H - box1 , H - box2 , and H - box3 ) that typically contain eight histidines between them ( 19 ) . The distance between histidine boxes ( 8 ) and their specific amino acid sequences are characteristic of each subfamily of membrane - bound desaturases including first , w x , front - end , and sphingolipid desaturases ( 19 ) . To identify putative w x desaturase sequences , an automated genomic pipeline was built to filter out non – w x desaturase sequences . Ac - cording to the filter thresholds , sequences matching the following criteria were further considered : The FA _ desaturase ( PF00487 . 22 ) Pfam domain must be identified ( P < 1 × 10 − 10 ) within the protein sequence , but the Pfam domain Lipid _ DES ( PF08557 . 8 ) should not be present because it is typically associated with sphingolipid desaturases ; H - box1 had to be composed of five amino acid residues ( HXXXH , which excluded Scd / D 9 desaturases — HXXXXH ) ; H - box2 had to be composed of five amino acid residues ( HXXHH , which excluded front - end desaturases — HXXXHH ) ; H - box3 had to consist also of five amino acid residues ( HXXHH ) ; the number of amino acid residues between the end of H - box1 and the start of H - box2 had to be be - tween 30 and 32 ; H - box3 had to be located further apart close to the C - terminal region : the number of amino acids between the end of H - box2 and the start of H - box3 had to be between 120 and 250 . To distinguish w x from sphingolipid desaturases , the empirical frequency of amino acid occurrence within the histidine boxes of known eukary - otic sequences ( 19 ) was used to calculate the probability of a desatu - rase sequence being assigned to one of these two subfamilies . For example , the third and fourth amino acids in H - box1 of w x and sphin - golipid show very distinctive frequencies ( 19 ) , with w x desaturases typically having a cysteine followed by a glycine , whereas sphingolipid desaturases have an isoleucine and a serine . Only putative desaturase sequences with a probability ≥ 0 . 7 of being w x ( versus sphingolipid ) were retained for further analyses . From the initial putative 58 , 000 ho - mologous sequences , around 9000 passed all filtering steps ( around 15 . 7 % ) . Metazoan w x desaturase homolog search expansion To expand the number of distinct metazoan w x desaturase sequences , query metazoan sequences were searched against the following GenBank databases with BLAST ( version 2 . 6 . 0 + ) : whole genome shotgun ( WGS ) , transcriptome shotgun assemblies ( TSA ) sets and tsa _ nr . Specifically , the tblastn program was used against 515 WGS and 935 TSA projects from metazoan nonchordate species , and blastp was used to search metazoan w x desaturase homologs against tsa _ nr ( E - value < 1 × 10 − 10 ) . In addition , species - specific genome / transcriptome projects were also investigated ( for example , P . vulgata ) . Genome WGS contigs containing significantly similarsequencesto w xdesaturaseswereannotatedwithcorrespondingtran - scriptsobtainedfromtheTSAandSequenceReadArchive ( SRA ) excepttwo Radix auricularia sequences ( MUZC01000242 and MUZC01000057 ) , which were annotated by tblastn using w x desaturase homologs from other Heterobranchia species as queries . For each transcript , we selected thelongestopenreadingframe ( ORF ) sequencewithaminimumlength of 159 amino acids ( to guarantee that the three histidine boxes were present in the sequence ) . All selected TSA and tsa _ nr sequences were then evaluated using the filters described above . In total , 41 additional metazoan sequences were found with this step . Sequence number reduction : Clustering , isoforms , and identical sequence removal To reduce the total number of sequences for the final data set , the software package SiLix v . 1 . 2 . 10 ( 34 ) was applied to the nonmetazoan sequences ( based on BLAST “ all against all ” pair of sequences align - ments ) for clustering sequences that shared a minimal pair - sequence identity and overlap of 70 % . For nonmetazoan taxa , one representative of each taxonomic rank ( for example , order or phylum ) found in each cluster was selected for further analyses . The total number of sequences after clustering analysis was reduced to 910 and further reduced to 892 after removing identical sequences and splice isoforms ( longest one for each species was kept ) . The sequences selected by IsoSVM ( 892 ) were then aligned with MAFFT v . 7 . 309 ( reference , parameters : – genafpair – maxiterate 1000 ) , and 100 bootstrap maximum likelihood ( ML ) – based phylogenetic trees were inferred using ExaML tool v . 3 . 0 . 18 ( 35 ) . The ExaML trees were inferred given 100 precomputed starting trees using standard RAxML v . 8 . 2 . 9 ( 36 ) following the ExaML manual instructions ( https : / / github . com / stamatak / ExaML / blob / master / manual / ExaML . pdf ) . The majority - rule consensus ExaML tree was used to select sequences representing distinct well - supported clades of major taxo - nomic ranks ( for example , keeping only major Dikaria fungal lineages ) and to exclude potential contaminations . A last data set reduction ( down to 287 sequences ) was made by excluding the sequences with pairwise identity below 29 % and overlap below 70 % . Phylogenetic analyses The final sequences were aligned with MAFFT ( parameters : – genafpair – maxiterate 1000 ) and filtered with GUIDANCE v . 2 . 0 ( 37 ) with the following parameters : 100 bootstrap replicates , sequence , column , and S C I E N C E A D V A N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E Kabeya et al . , Sci .

The resultant MSA was then filtered to remove columns with gaps in 95 % or more of the sequences . The best - fit model of protein evolution was selected using ProtTest v . 3 . 3 ( 38 ) basedontheBayesianInformationCriterion . TheMLphylogenetic inference was performed using RAxML with 100 rapid bootstrap repli - cates and 20 ML searches . The Bayesian inference was applied using MrBayes v . 3 . 2 . 1 ( 39 ) and PhyloBayes MPI v . 1 . 7a ( 40 ) . MrBayes was run with four Markov chains incrementally heated with the default values . Each chain started with a randomly generated tree and ran for 1x107 generations with sampling frequency of 1 tree for every 100 gen - erations . The posterior distribution of trees , after discarding the first 25 % as burn - in , was summarized in a 50 % majority - rule consensus tree . Two independent replicates were conducted and inspected for consistency . The PhyloBayes analysis was executed applying distinct compositional profiles and one substitution rate matrix inferred from the data ( CAT + GTR model ) . Similar to the MrBayes analysis , two independent chains were run in parallel , which terminated reaching moderate convergence after around 16 , 000 cycles with maximum dis - crepancy observed across all bipartitions of 0 . 28 . The final protein sequence alignment and the various phylogenetic trees ( text and image format ) can be accessed as described in Data and materials availability . Functional characterization of w x desaturases from selected metazoan species Full - length ORF sequences of putative w x desaturase from A . millepora , P . vulgata , P . dumerilii , and L . salmonis were obtained from their tran - scriptome or genomic databases by tblastn searches using several amino acid sequences of w x desaturase as queries ( table S1 ) . When necessary , extension of full - length ORF sequences was performed by rapid am - plification of cDNA ends ( RACE ) to determine the full - length ORF sequencewithconditionsasdescribedintableS2 . Alltheprimersetsused for polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) are shown in table S3 . The DNA sequences of PCR products ( sequenced at GATC Biotech ) were aligned to produce full - length ORF sequences . The synthetic nucleotide ORF se - quences from the P . dumerilii ( KY707886 ) and A . vaga ( MF448337 and MF448339 ) w x desaturases were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies Inc . and Eurofins Genomics K . K . , respectively . The function of w x desaturases was characterized in the yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae ( 41 ) . Briefly , theORFofthetwo w xdesaturase – like genes retrieved in each selected species were amplified by PCR using primers containing restriction enzyme sites for further cloning into the yeast expression vector pYES2 ( table S3 ) . The pYES2 constructs containing the w x desaturase ORF sequences were sequenced ( GATC Biotech ) prior to being used to transform Inv Sc 1 ( Invitrogen ) yeast as described previously ( 41 ) . Transgenic yeast expressing each w x desa - turase were grown in the absence of exogenously added FA substrates or in the presence of 18 : 2 w 6 , 18 : 3 w 6 , 20 : 2 w 6 , 20 : 3 w 6 , 20 : 4 w 6 , and 22 : 4 w 6 supplemented at 0 . 5 ( C 18 ) , 0 . 75 ( C 20 ) , and 1 mM ( C 22 ) to com - pensate for uptake efficiency varying with chain length ( 41 ) . Control treatments consisted of yeast transformed with the empty pYES2 and run under the exact same conditions as above . After 48 hours , yeast cells were collected and FAME derivatives were prepared from total lipids ( 41 ) . Functions of the w x desaturases were established by comparing the FA profiles of w x desaturase transformed yeast with those of the controls . For exogenously added FA substrates , desaturase conversions were calculated as [ product areas / ( product areas + substrate area ) ] × 100 ( 41 ) . Identity of the desaturation products was determined by com - paringtheirretentiontimeswithFAcontainedincommercialstandards ( Marine Oil FAME Mix , Restek Corporation ; Supelco 37 Component FAME Mix , Sigma - Aldrich ) . Positions of double bonds were determined by preparing 4 , 4 - dimethyloxazoline ( DMOX ) derivatives of FAME samples followed by gas chromatography – mass spectrometry analysis ( 41 ) . Reagents For functional characterization assays , all FA substrates were purchased from Nu - Chek Prep Inc . except 20 : 4 w 6 , which was from Cayman Chemical . Chemicals used to prepare the S . cerevisiae minimal medium uracil were from Sigma - Aldrich , except for the bacteriological agar ob - tainedfromOxoidLtd . Thin - layerchromatography ( 20×20cm×0 . 25mm ) plates precoated with silica gel 60 ( without fluorescent indicator ) were purchased from Merck . All solvents were HPLC ( high - performance liq - uid chromatography ) – grade and were from Fisher Scientific . DMOX derivatization reagents ( 2 - amino - 2 - methyl - 1 - propanol ) were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . Statistics ComparisonsofmeansofFAcompositionbetweencontrolyeast ( n = 6 ) and each transgenic yeast ( n = 4 ) were carried out using Dunnett ’ s test with P < 0 . 05 indicating statistical significance .
