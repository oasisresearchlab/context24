Differential requirements for Alix and ESCRT - III in cytokinesis and HIV - 1 release Jez G . Carlton , Monica Agromayor , and Juan Martin - Serrano * Department of Infectious Diseases , King’s College London School of Medicine , London SE1 9RT , United Kingdom Edited by Robert A . Lamb , Northwestern University , Evanston , IL , and approved April 23 , 2008 ( received for review February 28 , 2008 ) The ESCRT machinery functions in topologically equivalent mem - brane ﬁssion events , namely multivesicular body formation , the terminal stages of cytokinesis and HIV - 1 release . Here , we show that the ESCRT - III - binding protein Alix is recruited to the midbody of dividing cells through binding Cep55 via an evolutionarily conserved peptide . Disruption of Cep55 / Alix / ESCRT - III interactions causes formation of aberrant midbodies and cytokinetic failure , demonstrating an essential role for these proteins in midbody morphology and cell division . We also show that the C terminus of Alix encodes a multimerization activity that is essential for its function in Alix - dependent HIV - 1 release and for interaction with Tsg101 . Last , we demonstrate that overexpression of Chmp4b and Chmp4c differentially inhibits HIV - 1 release and cytokinesis , sug - gesting possible reasons for gene expansion within the mamma - lian Class E VPS pathway . late domain (cid:1) viral budding (cid:1) Class E VPS (cid:1) L - Domain (cid:1) cell division C ompletion of cell division involves the postmitotic separation of daughter cells through the process of cytokinesis and requires abscission of the midbody , a microtubule - rich stalk of membrane that connects daughter cells and forms at a late stage of cell division ( 1 – 3 ) . Importantly , abscission must be coordi - nated by an activity inside the midbody , suggesting that a topologically unique mechanism of membrane fission is used . Recently , Centrosome Associated Protein , 55 kDa ( Cep55 ) , a mitotic phosphoprotein that relocalizes from the centrosome to the midbody during late mitosis , has been shown to play an essential role in abscission ( 4 – 6 ) . It has also been demonstrated that tumor - susceptibility gene 101 ( Tsg101 ) and Alg2 - interacting protein X ( Alix ) , both components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) machinery , interact with Cep55 , localize to the midbody and are themselves required for abscission ( 7 , 8 ) . These data suggest that the cytokinetic activity of Cep55 may be elicited through recruitment of the Class E VPS pathway . The ESCRT machinery regulates other membrane scission steps that bear a topological equivalence to midbody abscission , namely biogenesis of intraendosomal vesicles within multivesicu - lar bodies ( MVBs ) ( 9 ) and enveloped virus release ( 10 ) . During MVB formation , the ESCRT - machinery is recruited to endo - somes through the interaction of Tsg101 with ubiquitinated cargo and hepatocyte growth factor - regulated tyrosine kinase substrate ( Hrs ) and is thought to generate and sort cargo onto these intraendosomal vesicles . MVB formation is important for the termination of receptor signaling and is a prerequisite for receptor degradation ( 9 , 11 ) . The ESCRT machinery is also recruited by late domains ( L domains ) within retroviral Gag proteins and provides an activity that allows viral - particle release from the cell surface ; HIV - 1 Gag encodes two L domains that recruit the ESCRT machinery , a Tsg101 - binding PTAP motif ( 12 – 15 ) and an Alix - binding LYPX ( n ) L motif ( 16 , 17 ) . HIV - 1 release largely depends on its PTAP L domain ( 18 , 19 ) , although a virus rendered unable to interact with Tsg101 through muta - tion of this L domain is released entirely through its auxiliary Alix - dependent L domain ( 20 , 21 ) . ESCRT - III appears to be the membrane fission machinery recruited by ESCRT - I and Alix ( 11 ) . Overexpression of ESCRT - III subunits arrests viral budding , recapitulating the phenotype of an L domain - defective virus ( 17 , 22 – 24 ) , and mutations in the Bro1 domain of Alix that abrogate the Alix / ESCRT - III interaction also abolish the ability of Alix to mediate budding ( 20 , 21 ) and cell division ( 8 ) . A requirement for ESCRT - III in cell division has been suggested by the arrest of cytokinesis in cells overexpressing YFP - Chmp4 fusion proteins or a catalytically inactive Vps4 ( 7 , 8 ) . Overall , the anatomy of the Class E VPS pathway is conserved from yeasts to humans , and ESCRT - III is one of the most conserved components in the pathway ( 9 ) . Intriguingly , the mammalian ESCRT machinery is significantly expanded compared with yeast , with three mammalian isoforms of Vps32 and four of Vps37 , suggesting that gene expansion in the mammalian pathway may allow for functional diversification of this machinery . Alix binds numerous trafficking proteins via its proline - rich region ( PRR ) , including Cin85 / SETA ( 25 ) , CD2AP [ an adaptor protein involved in MVB biogenesis ( 26 ) , and cytokinesis ( 27 ) ] , the family of endophilins ( 28 ) and the Cep55 - binding and ESCRT - I component Tsg101 ( 7 , 8 , 29 ) . Additionally , recent studies have identified an activity in Alix’s PRR that is essential for Alix - dependent HIV - 1 release ( 20 , 21 ) . The nature of this activity remains unclear , but current speculation is that it represents an unknown interaction partner of Alix . Here , we demonstrate an essential role for Cep55 / Alix / ESCRT - III interactions in midbody formation and completion of cytoki - nesis , define the nature of the Alix - dependent HIV - 1 release activity within Alix’s PRR , and provide evidence suggesting that gene duplication of ESCRT - III in mammals reflects an adaptation to specialized functions such as midbody abscission . Results Cep55 Binds to an Evolutionarily Conserved Peptide in Alix . A con - served role for the ESCRT machinery in cell division is sug - gested by the accumulation of multinucleate trichomes in Ara - bidopsis thaliana elch / tsg101 mutants ( 30 ) , indicating that the ESCRT machinery may function in cell division in other organ - isms . To determine whether the interaction of the ESCRT machinery with Cep55 is conserved in other species , we mapped Cep55’s binding site on Alix by using a combination of yeast two - hybrid and pull - down assays . In agreement with Morita et al . ( 8 ) Cep55 binds to a repeating PxY motif from residues 801 – 806 within Alix’s PRR [ supporting information ( SI ) Fig . S1 ] . Muta - tional analysis of this motif demonstrated that two pairs of amino acids—residues P801 , P802 and T805 , Y806 – were essential for Cep55 binding , suggesting that Alix makes multiple contacts with Author contributions : J .

Importantly , mutation of P801V and P802D abrogated Alix’s ability to bind Cep55 yet preserved its interac - tions with known binding partners ( Fig . 1 A and Fig . S2 ) . This mutation prevented recruitment of Alix to the midbody ( Fig . 1 B ) . Sequence analysis of the PRR identified a cluster of evolutionarily conserved amino acids around the Cep55 - binding site ( Fig . 1 C ) . Indeed , deletion of the PRR abolished the ability of Alix to bind Cep55 , and the grafting of a peptide encoding this conserved region onto Alix - (cid:1) PRR ( Alix - (cid:1) PRR (cid:1) Peptide ) was sufficient to restore both Cep55 - binding and midbody localiza - tion ( Fig . 1 D and E ) . Cytokinesis was defective in both Alix - depleted cells and in Alix - depleted cells reliant on stably ex - pressed mCh - Alix R (cid:1) PRR ( Fig . 2 A and Fig . S3 ) .

Alix R (cid:1) PRR (cid:1) Peptide ) allowed substantial , although incom - plete , rescue of these defects ( Fig . 2 A and Fig . S3 ) . These results suggest that a major role of the Alix PRR in cytokinesis is to bind Cep55 and that , although this interaction is conserved in other vertebrates , it is not present in organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Caenorhabditis elegans , or Drosophila melanogaster that lack the Cep55 - binding site within Alix’s PRR . We also tested other functional requirements for Alix in cytokinesis using cell lines stably expressing mCh - tagged ver - sions of Alix R rendered unable to bind certain partners ( Fig . S2 ) . Interestingly , mCh - Alix R 1 – 831 was functional in cytokinesis , showing that , in contrast to a role in Alix - dependent HIV - 1 release ( 20 , 21 ) , the extreme C terminus of Alix is not required for cell division ( Fig . 2 A and Fig . S3 ) . In agreement with Morita et al . ( 8 ) , we found that Alix constructs that could not be recruited by Cep55 ( P801V , P802D ) or could not bind the downstream ESCRT - III components Chmp4a , Chmp4b , or Chmp4c ( F199D or I212D ) were unable to rescue the cytokinesis defects induced by Alix depletion ( Fig . S3 ) . Importantly , mCh - Alix R F199D and I212D were still recruited to the midbody ( Fig . 2 B and Fig . S3 C ) , demonstrating that the cytokinesis defects occur as a direct consequence of a failure to recruit ESCRT - III to the site of abscission . Recruitment of ESCRT - III by Alix Determines Midbody Morphology . Tsg101 and Alix are recruited to the Flemming body through the interaction with Cep55 ; however , it remains unclear whether ESCRT - III is a structural component of the midbody . The Flemming body is a central region of the midbody characterized by a gap in (cid:2) - tubulin staining , but it is clear from electron micrography studies that interdigitating microtubules persist through this gap ( 31 , 32 ) , indicating that protein density at the Flemming body masks tubulin epitopes known to be present . In Cep55 - depleted cells , microtubules at the Flemming body are visible ( 6 , 7 ) , suggesting that Cep55 regulates recruitment of this density . We noted in Alix - depleted cells an accumulation of aberrant midbodies , with (cid:2) - tubulin staining persisting through the Flemming body ( Fig . 2 A and B ) . Importantly , structural elements of the Flemming body were still present in Alix - depleted cells because YFP - Cep55 was still recruited to the Flemming body ( Fig . 2 C ) . Defects in Flemming body formation observed in Alix - depleted cells were reversed through stable expression of mCh - Alix R ( Fig . 2 A and B ) . However , stable expression of mCh - Alix R F199D or mCh - Alix R I212D in Alix - depleted cells could not rescue formation of normal midbodies . Alix mutants that could not be recruited by Cep55 ( mCh - Alix R P801V , P802D ) or that lack the C - terminal PRR ( mCh - Alix R (cid:1) PRR ) also failed to rescue midbody morphology ( Fig . 2 A and B ) . Restoration of the ability of Alix R (cid:1) PRR to bind Cep55 ( mCh - Alix R (cid:1) PRR (cid:1) Peptide ) rescued midbody formation , and expression of Alix R mutants defective for binding to CD2AP , Cin85 , Tsg101 , and endophilins or lacking the terminal 37 residues also allowed formation of normal midbodies ( Fig . 2 A and B ) . These data recapitulate exactly the effects of siRNA against Cep55 ( 6 , 7 ) , show that Cep55 - dependent recruitment of the ESCRT - III subunits Chmp4a , Chmp4b and Chmp4c via Alix is required for the formation of morphologically normal mid - bodies , and suggest that ESCRT - III is a major component of the Flemming body . Differential Requirement for ESCRT - III Subunits in Cytokinesis and HIV - 1 Budding . Given the lack of evidence supporting a role for the ESCRT machinery in yeast cell division , we wished to examine whether gene duplication within the ESCRT machin - ery reflected an adaptation to mammalian - specific function - alities . We examined differential requirements for mammalian Chmp4 isoforms in cytokinesis and HIV - 1 release by overex - pressing YFP - Chmp4 fusions that have been shown to function as dominant - negative proteins ( 22 ) . These experiments re - vealed that , although all Chmp4 isoforms inhibited both HIV - 1 release and cytokinesis to some degree , YFP - Chmp4b was the most potent inhibitor of viral budding , producing a large decrease in released infectious virions and a characteristic p24 / p25 processing defect in cellular Gag ( Fig . 3 A and B ) , whereas Chmp4c was a much more potent inhibitor of cyto - kinesis than Chmp4a or Chmp4b ( Fig . 3 C ) . The differential inhibition of HIV - 1 budding and cytokinesis by heterologous Chmp4 fusions suggests that the Chmp4 isoforms might be differentially adapted to the multiple functions of the ESCRT machinery in mammals . Alix Multimerization Is Required for Interaction with Tsg101 : Impli - cations for Cytokinesis . When analyzing our panel of Alix - interaction partners , we noticed that Alix R 1 - 831 could no longer interact with Alix ( Fig . S2 ) , indicating that this region is required for multimerization . We mapped this activity to residues Y864 and Y865 in Alix’s extreme C terminus ( Fig . 4 A and B ) . Additionally , we noted that Alix R 1 - 831 could not interact with Tsg101 ( Fig . 4 A ) , although the Tsg101 - binding 717 PSAP 720 motif was present , suggesting that the terminal 37 residues of Alix encode an activity that is required for Tsg101 binding . Mapping this activity identified a requirement for the sequence between residues 853 and 858 ( Fig . 4 A ) overlapping with the residues 852 PSYP 855 . We initially speculated that this sequence repre - Fig . 3 . Differential requirements for Chmp4 isoforms in retroviral budding and cytokinesis .

However , scanning mu - tagenesis of this sequence revealed that these residues made only a limited contribution to direct - Tsg101 binding ( Fig . S4 A and B ) . Intriguingly however , mutation of this entire motif ( P852A , Y854G , P855A ; Alix R PSYP m ) greatly reduced Alix’s interaction with Tsg101 , and mutation of both PSAP and PSYP sequences ( Alix R PSAP m , PSYP m ) abolished the ability of Alix to bind Tsg101 ( Fig . 4 C and D ) . We found that Alix R PSYP m could bind all partners tested but was unable to multimerize ( Figs . S2 and S4 C ) . The ability of these Alix mutations to interact with Tsg101 was confirmed by coprecipitation assays . Interestingly , these assays demonstrated that Alix - multimerization is required for interaction with Tsg101 ( Fig . 4 D ) , because multimerization - defective C - terminal deletions of Alix R , Alix R PSYP m , Alix R Y864A , and Y865A all failed to bind Tsg101 . Crucially , restoring the ability of Alix R 1 - 863 to multimerize through fusion of the heterologous multimerization domain from the GCN4 leucine zipper ( 33 ) to Alix R 1 - 863 ( Alix R 1 - 863 / LZ ) rescued binding to Tsg101 to control levels ( Fig . 4 D ) . These data demonstrate that Alix multimerization is required for efficient Tsg101 binding . Cytokinetic defects in cells expressing Tsg101 containing a UEV - domain mutation ( M95A ) abolishing interaction with Alix have been observed ( 7 ) . However , these effects could be due to loss of binding to other PTAP - containing proteins ( 34 ) . To establish the requirement for Alix / Tsg101 interaction in cytoki - nesis , we used the PSAP and PSYP mutations that were ren - dered unable to interact with Tsg101 . We created stable HeLa cells expressing mCh - tagged versions of Alix R PSAP m , Alix R PSYP m , or Alix R PSAP m PSYP m ( Fig . 4 E ) and examined the ability of these proteins to rescue cytokinetic defects induced by Alix depletion . Both mCh - Alix R PSAP m and mCh - Alix R PSYP m could rescue cytokinesis in Alix - depleted cells . However , the joint mutant that was most severely compromised for Tsg101 - binding ( mCh - Alix R PSAP m , PSYP m ) could support only a partial rescue ( Fig . 4 D and E ) , indicating that Alix - Tsg101 interactions are required for cytokinesis . Alix Multimerization Is Required for HIV - 1 Release . The use of a version of HIV - 1 that is released in an Alix - dependent manner has exposed a requirement for the terminal 37 residues of Alix in HIV - 1 release ( 20 , 21 ) . We confirmed this and , in agreement with previous reports , demonstrated that Alix’s interaction with HIV - 1 Gag and ESCRT - III were essential for this activity , but interaction with endophilins CD2AP , Cin85 , and Cep55 were dispensable ( Fig . S5 ) . We mapped this activity and demonstrated that it correlated well with the site of Alix multimerization ( Fig . S6 A ) ( 21 ) . However , Alix Y864A and Y865A did not fully recapitulate the phenotype of Alix R 1 - 831 and additional dele - tions ( for example , Alix R 1 - 853 ) resulted in a more pronounced defect in HIV - 1 release ( Fig . S6 A ) . Mutation of the PSAP motif had little effect on the ability of Alix to support HIV - 1 release , suggesting that interaction with Tsg101 is not required for this activity ( Fig . 5 A ) . However , as with its effect on multimerization , mutation of the entire PSYP sequence disrupted Alix - dependent HIV - 1 release , indicating that multimerization contributes to Alix - dependent HIV - 1 release . Indeed , Alix R PSAP m , PSYP m , Y864A , and Y865A recapitulated fully the phenotype of Alix R 1 - 831 in this assay ( Fig . 5 A ) , suggesting that Alix multimerization is required for Alix - dependent HIV - 1 release . To extend these studies , a gain - of - function approach was followed whereby the GCN4 LZ was appended to Alix R (cid:1) PRR or Alix R 1 - 863 , restoring the ability of these proteins to multimerize ( Fig . S6 B ) . Similarly to wild - type Alix R , Alix R 1 - 863 / LZ fully rescued Alix - dependent HIV - 1 release ( Fig . 5 B ) . However , Alix R (cid:1) PRR / LZ could not support this activity , suggesting that other regions of the PRR are required or that forced oligomerization of Alix R (cid:1) PRR results in its adoption of a conformation that cannot support HIV - 1 release . These data demonstrate that Alix multimeriza - tion represents a C - terminal activity that is essential for Alix - dependent HIV - 1 release . Because neither the C - terminal 37 residues of Alix nor Alix multimerization activity were required for cytokinesis ( Fig . 2 and Fig . S3 ) , and , because Alix interacts only weakly with HIV - 1p6 ( 20 ) , we questioned whether multimerization was required for release of viruses employing high - affinity interactions with Alix . Using Alix - siRNA , we suppressed release of a L domain - defective HIV - 1 that was complemented in trans with the high - affinity Alix - binding L domain of EIAVp9 ( 22 ) .

Discussion In this article , we have explored the role of Alix in two ESCRT - dependent cellular processes , namely cytokinesis and viral budding . We show that Cep55 binds a conserved peptide within Alix’s PRR through multiple contacts , demonstrating that this region is an evolutionarily important constituent of the Alix - PRR . Using depletion and rescue experiments , we show that Alix acts as an adaptor protein , linking Cep55 with ESCRT - III to effect completion of cytokinesis . In many ways , this function of Cep55 parallels that of retroviral Gag proteins that elicit particle fission through recruitment of ESCRT - III via various adaptor proteins including Alix itself ( 16 , 17 ) , Tsg101 ( 12 – 15 ) , or the HECT ubiquitin ligases ( 35 ) . In making these observations , we add a degree of processivity to the mechanism of Cep55 - and ESCRT - dependent cytokinesis . We have also shown that Cep55 / Alix / ESCRT - III interactions are required for formation of morphologically normal midbod - ies . Because both Alix depletion and rescue with Alix - constructs that cannot recruit ESCRT - III render midbody microtubules visible to (cid:2) - tubulin , we reason that the ESCRT machinery is a constituent of the protein density of the Flemming body . Indeed , because YFP - Cep55 and mCh - Alix R F199D , but not mCh - Alix R P801V , P802D , are recruited by the midbody , we can be sure that the Flemming body is present in these Alix - depleted cells but that it is aberrant . Morphologically , these findings have parallels with phenomena observed on the cytosolic face of endosomes , where a proteinaceous Hrs - containing coat is observed adjacent to sites of MVB formation and concentrates ubiquitinated cargo before its inclusion in MVBs ( 9 ) . Whether this coat contains the ESCRT machinery remains to be established , but because ESCRT - III is proposed to form a proteinaceous lattice on endosomal membranes ( 23 ) , it is possible that , as in the case of the Flemming body , this visible density represents the ESCRT - machinery . Collectively , these data suggest that the cytokinetic defects that arise as a consequence of Cep55 depletion represent a failure to recruit Alix / ESCRT - III to the midbody . An important point that remains to be addressed is the mechanism used by the ESCRT machinery to achieve abscission . Electron - microscopic analysis of the terminal stages of cytoki - nesis reveals that the midbody thins before abscission , reducing its diameter to distances of 200 nm ( 31 ) . Because the ESCRT machinery is proposed to act in the scission of viral particles tethered to the plasma membrane via 50 - to 100 - nm diameter stalks , it is possible that the ‘‘thinning’’ process reduces the midbody diameter sufficiently to allow the ESCRT machinery to act directly in abscission . Indeed , Vps4 , known to be required for the final stage of virus budding ( 10 ) and abscission ( 7 , 8 ) . was recently localized to rings on either side of very thin midbodies ( 8 ) , suggesting that it acts in late - stages of cytokinesis . Alterna - tively , the ESCRT machinery may participate in the thinning process itself ; close examination of midbodies reveals the pres - ence of budding structures emanating from their surface ( 31 ) , and it has recently been demonstrated that polarized neuroen - docrine cells shed membranous particles from their midbodies and primary cilia in a process topologically equivalent to viral budding ( 36 ) . Although these budding structures may arise simply as a consequence of the presence of the recruited ESCRT machinery , it is possible that this machinery plays an active role in midbody thinning before abscission . Additionally , we have defined the nature of the HIV - 1 bud - ding activity present within Alix’s C terminus . We show that this region represents a multimerization module and that Alix’s ability to multimerize represents the essential activity of this region in HIV - 1 release . Although the major determinant of multimerization is a dityrosine motif at residues 864 and 865 , the loss of multimerization upon mutation of residues 852 PSYP 855 suggests that multiple Alix – Alix contacts are made throughout Alix’s extreme C terminus . Intriguingly , we found that Alix - multimerization is also required for Tsg101 binding , suggesting an important mechanistic requirement for this region in assem - bly of Alix / ESCRT complexes . However , although full Alix / Tsg101 binding is required for cytokinesis , Alix multimerization appears dispensable ; it is possible that Cep55’s multimerization activity ( 4 ) may override this requirement in this case . Addi - tionally , multimerization appears dispensable for release of HIV rendered dependent on the high - affinity Alix - binding EIAVp9 L domain , suggesting that it may act to enhance the weak inter - action between Alix and HIV - 1p6 through avidity effects . Last , using a dominant - negative approach , we also demon - strate that Chmp4c is a more potent inhibitor of cytokinesis than Chmp4a or Chmp4b , yet Chmp4b is the most potent inhibitor of HIV - 1 release . The reasons for this differential activity are currently unclear , but it is of note that Chmp4c contains se - quence insertions not present within other isoforms that may allow for its differential regulation . These experiments provide evidence suggesting that gene expansion might reflect the func - tional diversification of the mammalian ESCRT machinery , which will be an important area of future study .
