Ayscough 1 , * 1 Department of Biomedical Science , Firth Court , University of Shefﬁeld , Shefﬁeld S10 2TN , UK Summary Background : Actin nucleation is the key rate - limiting step in actin polymerization , and tight regulation of this process is critical to ensure that actin ﬁlaments form only at speciﬁc regions of the cell . Las17 is the primary activator of Arp2 / 3 - driven actin nucleation in yeast and is required for membrane invagination during endocytosis . Its mammalian homolog , WASP , has also been studied extensively as an activator of Arp2 / 3 - driven actin polymerization . In both Las17 and WASP , actin nucleation activity is attributed to an ability to bind actin through a WH2 domain and to bind Arp2 / 3 through an acidic region . The central region of both Las17 and WASP is rich in proline residues and is generally considered to bind to SH3 - domain - containing proteins . Results : We have identiﬁed a novel actin - binding activity in the polyproline domain of both yeast Las17 and mammalian WASP . The polyproline domain of Las17 is also able to nucleate actin ﬁlaments independently of Arp2 / 3 . Mutational analysis reveals that proline residues are required for this nucleation activity and that the binding site on actin maps to a region distinct from those used by other nucleation activities . In vivo analysis of yeast strains expressing las17 mutated in the WH2 domain , one of its proline motifs , or both shows addi - tive defects in actin organization and endocytosis , with the proline mutant conferring more severe phenotypes than the WH2 mutant . Conclusions : Our data demonstrate a new actin - binding and nucleation mechanism in Las17 / WASP that is required for its function in actin regulation during endocytosis . Introduction Actin is one of the most highly conserved and abundant eukaryotic proteins , playing a critical role in many cell pro - cesses ranging from motility , cell organization , and mor - phology to membrane trafﬁcking . Actin monomers ( G - actin ) are assembled into dynamic polarized ﬁlaments ( F - actin ) that are regulated by an array of actin - associated proteins [ 1 ] . These proteins ensure that actin is assembled and disas - sembled at deﬁned sites in response to speciﬁc internal and external cell signals . Although many stages of actin turnover are under regulation , the key rate - limiting step is that of actin nucleation , which can be deﬁned as the formation of a stable multimer . Tight regulation of actin nucleation is neces - sary to ensure that ﬁlaments form only at speciﬁc regions of the cell [ 2 ] . Until recently , two major actin nucleators were recognized , the Arp2 / 3 complex and formins [ 2 – 5 ] . Arp2 / 3 is proposed to polymerize new ﬁlaments on the side of existing ﬁlaments . It is a weak nucleator alone and functions with nucleation - promoting factors such as WASP to form a branched actin network [ 6 ] . Formins function as dimers to assemble un - branched ﬁlaments . A recently described third group of nucle - ators , including Spire , Cordon - bleu , and Leiomodin , have a general mechanism of tandem actin monomer binding [ 5 , 7 ] . All of these proteins contain one or more copies of the recognized actin - binding domain WH2 , but also other domains that contribute further actin - binding function [ 8 – 10 ] . This increasingly recognized variation indicates there may be other nucleators with distinct architecture that have yet to be identiﬁed . Las17 , the homolog of WASP , is considered the primary nucleation - promoting factor for Arp2 / 3 in yeast [ 11 , 12 ] . Similar to WASP , Las17 has a C - terminal WCA domain comprising a W H2 domain that binds monomeric actin and a c entral plus a cidic ( CA ) region that binds Arp2 / 3 [ 12 ] . Both Las17 and Arp2 / 3 localize to cortical actin patches , and they play a key role in driving the actin polymerization required for the forma - tion of endocytic invaginations . Intriguingly , however , deletion of either the acidic region alone or the entire WCA domain of Las17 yields a very mild cellular phenotype , and actin organi - zation at cortical patches appears normal [ 13 , 14 ] . A further enigma in the function of Las17 is that it arrives at endo - cytic sites 10 – 15 s before Arp2 / 3 , raising the possibility of an Arp2 / 3 - independent function . Finally , Arp2 / 3 is generally con - sidered to nucleate ﬁlaments on existing ﬁlaments [ 5 ] . The identity of the proteins capable of generating these initial ﬁla - ments has not previously been addressed . Here we present data investigating a novel actin - binding function of Las17 that resides in its polyproline ( PP ) region . Results The Las17 Polyproline Fragment Binds Actin in Yeast Two - Hybrid Assays Although Arp2 / 3 is activated by binding the Las17 WCA domain , polymerization assays have shown that inclusion of full - length Las17 gives higher levels of actin nucleation [ 15 ] . Furthermore , inclusion of the polyproline region with the WCA domain of WASP and SCAR in similar Arp2 / 3 - driven assays also causes a signiﬁcant increase in polymerization rate [ 16 ] . The nature of this additional contribution to actin polymerization kinetics has not been addressed . We aimed to determine whether the polyproline region of Las17 harbors further actin - interacting activity that might explain previous in vivo and in vitro ﬁndings . Making use of an actin yeast two - hybrid construct suc - cessfully used in other studies to identify novel actin - binding proteins [ 17 ] , we determined whether a full - length Las17 construct or a construct comprising its polyproline region ( Las17PP ) was able to interact with actin . The domains of Las17 used are illustrated in Figure 1A . As shown , b - galactosi - dase reporter assays reveal an interaction between Las17PP ( amino acids 292 – 536 ) and actin ( Figure 1B ) . Deletions from 2 These authors contributed equally to this work * Correspondence : k . ayscough @ shefﬁeld . ac . uk both N and C termini of Las17PP reduced activation of the reporters , indicating either that multiple binding sites exist or that a single binding site is formed from residues at both ends of the construct . However , about 50 % of reporter activity was lost on deletion of the ﬁnal 36 amino acids . This was un - expected because there is no homology with known actin - binding proteins in this region . Las17 has nine tracts of ﬁve proline residues ( 5 3 PP ) ( see Figure S1A available online ) , with eight of these in the region studied . Four 5 3 PP are also recognized SH3 - binding motifs and contain adjacent basic residues that are proposed to contribute to SH3 - domain binding , whereas the C - terminal 5 3 PP tracts do not have associated basic residues and have not been identiﬁed as SH3 - binding sites [ 18 ] . Within the 36 aa region ( aa 500 – 536 ) that makes the most signiﬁcant contri - bution to actin binding in the yeast two - hybrid assay are two 5 3 PP stretches , suggesting a possible proline - based actin - binding motif . To test this , prolines in the most C - terminal four tracts were mutagenized . As shown in Figure 1B , muta - genesis of three of these sites reduced the interaction , indi - cating a contribution by prolines to actin binding , with more C - terminal tracts playing a predominant role . Las17 Binds Directly to Actin and Drives Polymerization In Vitro It is well documented that proﬁlin can bind to polyproline regions in actin - binding proteins , and it is proposed to aid delivery of actin monomers for polymerization [ 19 , 20 ] . How - ever , direct binding of proﬁlin to Las17 has not been reported . In addition , although verprolin binds both Las17 and proﬁlin , the Las17 - verprolin interacting region is not part of the Las17 region used in the yeast two - hybrid assays [ 21 ] . This suggests that Las17PP may interact directly with actin . To test this , we generated glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusions of Las17PP and Las17PP + WCA on Sepharose beads and incubated them with actin containing a low level of ﬂuorescently labeled actin Figure 1 .

( D ) Actin was polymerized in the presence or absence of salts including 50 mM KCl and / or in the presence of recombinant GST - Las17PP . Samples were spun to pellet F - actin and any associated proteins . ( E ) Electron microscopy was performed to determine whether ﬁlaments were formed in the presence of Las17PP ( GST cleaved ) . A Novel Actin Nucleation Activity in Yeast WASP 197 to detect binding . Although association of Las17PP + WCA with actin was predicted due to the presence of the well - char - acterized monomer - binding WH2 domain , similar binding of Las17PP alone was unexpected ( Figure 1C ) . In contrast , GST alone on beads shows no association with actin . A high - speed centrifugation assay is frequently used to demonstrate F - actin binding ( Figure 1D ) . In the presence of salt , actin is induced to polymerize and enter the pellet frac - tion . GST - Las17PP when incubated with actin also shifts to the pellet , demonstrating binding . Unexpectedly , in the absence of salt , when actin alone is unable to pellet , addition of GST - Las17PP ( but no salt ) also causes pelleting , indicating that Las17PP binds actin and potentially nucleates its poly - merization . In order to ascertain whether the actin was pellet - ing due to ﬁlament formation rather than simply aggregating , samples were analyzed by electron microscopy . Filaments formed in the presence of Las17PP ( cleaved from GST ) were very similar to those formed in the presence of salt ( Figure 1E ) . Las17PP Nucleates Actin Filaments Absence of salt is nonphysiological , so to investigate the possibility of nucleation further , a pyrene - actin polymerization assay was performed in the presence of salts . Incorporation of pyrene - labeled actin into ﬁlaments as they form can be detected ﬂuorometrically as an enhanced ﬂuorescence sig - nal . Actin ( 5 m M ) was polymerized with increasing levels of Las17PP . Using this approach , measurements were made to determine the afﬁnity of Las17 binding to actin , giving a K d of 0 . 22 m M ( Figure S2 ) . This is comparable to the apparent afﬁnity reported of 0 . 4 m M for WASP WCA domain with actin [ 22 ] . These assays also revealed that in the presence of Las17PP , the lag phase of polymerization is reduced , indicating that the PP region nucleates actin ﬁlaments in the absence of other proteins ( Figure 2A ) . In addition , the rate of polymerization and the ﬁnal level of F - actin at steady state are increased . These data demonstrate that Las17PP interacts with actin and can trigger both nucleation and increased polymerization . The higher ﬁnal amount of polymerized actin observed at steady state suggests that the fragment is able to reduce the critical concentration of actin in the reaction . If Las17PP nucleates actin ﬁlaments de novo , then an increased number of ﬁlaments should be generated in a given time . To test this , we determined the number of ﬁlaments formed after polymerization induction using ﬂuorescence microscopy . Actin ( 3 m M + 0 . 4 m M Alexa 568 - labeled actin ) was induced to polymerize , samples were taken after 30 min , and the number of ﬁlaments per grid square was counted . As shown in Figures 2B and 2C , there was a signiﬁcant increase in ﬁlament number following addition of Las17PP , further supporting the presence of nucleating activity . Two questions were then addressed . First , does the number of PP tracts affect the ability to nucleate actin ? Second , are prolines central to activity ? A 28 - mer peptide of Las17PP ( resi - dues 501 – 528 ) was synthesized and incubated with actin . The peptide did not substantially reduce the lag phase of actin polymerization , suggesting that the ability to nucleate is a function of having more than two 5 3 PP tracts ( Figure 2D ) . However , peptide addition did cause an increased polymeriza - tion rate and ﬁnal level of F - actin . Mutation of both PP tracts from PPPPP to PPPAA completely blocked the effect of the peptide on actin dynamics , demonstrating the critical role played by proline residues in the actin interaction . Afragment carrying all eight 5 3 PP tracts but mutagenized at the site contributing most actin - binding activity in yeast two - hybrid analysis ( PP506 , 507AA ; Figure 1B ) was also puriﬁed . This fragment nucleated actin , shown by a reduced lag phase , but overall F - actin level at steady state was reduced ( Figure 2E ) . This supports the idea that multiple 5 3 PP inter - action sites can promote actin nucleation and demonstrates that the PP506 , 507 site plays an important role in binding actin , potentially reducing the critical concentration during polymerization . The Polyproline Region in WASP Interacts with Actin To determine whether PP tracts in other related proteins are able to function in a manner similar to Las17PP , we subcloned the polyproline region of human WASP ( amino acids 300 – 430 ) to generate a GST fusion . This region contains four tracts of ﬁve or more proline residues . After cleavage from GST , re - combinant WASP - PP was incubated with actin in a pyrene assay ( Figure 2F ) . Under these conditions , higher concentra - tions of WASP - PP increase the overall level of F - actin polymer - ized but do not cause a reduction in lag phase . Electron microscopy revealed actin ﬁlaments when G - actin was incu - bated with WASP - PP ( Figure 2G ) . Together , the in vitro data with puriﬁed proteins demon - strate that both Las17 and WASP - PP regions can interact with actin directly and thereby enhance actin polymerization . The interaction speciﬁcally requires prolines . If PP tracts contribute actin - binding function alone , or in concert with other domains , such tracts may function similarly in other actin - binding proteins , which might indicate additional func - tionality for such proteins . We performed a genome - wide search for proteins containing two or more tracts of ﬁve proline residues . Surprisingly , there are only eight such proteins in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome , and intriguingly , ﬁve of these proteins ( formins Bni1 and Bnr1 and the Arp2 / 3 nucle - ation - promoting factors Las17 , Vrp1 , and Pan1 ) have been directly linked to actin nucleation . Of the remaining three proteins , Eap1 has been linked with TOR signaling and has been detected in a screen for genes involved in endocytosis [ 23 , 24 ] . Analysis of all S . cerevisiae proteins with a single 5 3 PP is shown in Table S1 and Figure S3 . Mapping Binding of Las17PP to Actin Given that both the WH2 domain and proﬁlin are known to bind at the barbed end of an actin monomer [ 25 , 26 ] , it was of interest to determine whether the actin - binding site for Las17PP bound the same site or a distinct surface of actin . To map the binding site of Las17PP , we used a yeast two - hybrid approach in which a Gal4 binding domain ( Gal4BD ) - actin fusion was mutated to generate mutant actin alleles . This alanine - scan collection has been used to map interac - tions between actin and Aip1 [ 17 ] . An interaction between actin and Las17PP was assessed in strains carrying 27 actin alleles . In two cases , act1 - 104 and act1 - 111 , no growth was observed ( Figure 3A ) , indicating that the interaction was disrupted . In these mutants , expression of Gal4BD fusion was veriﬁed by western blotting ( data not shown ) . The position of alleles within actin was then considered . act1 - 104 carries the muta - tions K315A and E316A , and act1 - 111 carries the mutations D222A , E224A , and E226A . These sites reside on a surface between subdomain III and IV on the monomer ( Figure 3B ) , strongly implicating this region in Las17PP binding . Within the actin ﬁlament ( Figure 3C ) , residues in each allele are ex - posed and available for interactions ; thus , unlike WH2 , which binds actin monomers , these sites can mediate binding to both G - actin and F - actin . Current Biology Vol 23 No 3 198 Las17PP and Las17 - WH2 Are Both Required for Normal Growth and Actin Organization In Vivo Analysis of cells expressing act1 - 104 as the sole actin in cells revealed defects in endocytic patch movement , indicating the effect of inhibiting Las17PP binding ( Figure S4 ) . However , because this mutation may disrupt binding to other actin - binding proteins ( e . g . , formins Bni1 and Bnr1 ) , we investigated Las17PP - actin function further through generation of Las17 mutations . Proline residues 506 and 507 have not been map - ped as part of an SH3 interaction site ; they gave the strongest defect in actin binding by two - hybrid analysis and were shown Figure 2 . Las17PP Nucleates Actin Filaments ( A ) Las17PP ( L - PP ) was cleaved from its GST tag and incubated at different concentrations ( 0 . 08 m M , 0 . 1 m M , and 0 . 14 m M ) with 5 m M actin in the presence of 25 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , and 1 mM EGTA , in a pyrene - actin assay where actin polymerization can be followed from nucleation ( lag phase ) through to steady - state actin tread - milling . ( B ) To determine whether Las17PP increases nucleation events , we incubated 3 m M actin ( + 0 . 4 m M Alexa 488 actin ) with 0 . 14 m M Las17PP and visualized it after 30 min . Scale bar repre - sents 5 m m . ( C ) The number of actin ﬁlaments per unit area ( 1 / 20 of total image area ) for up to 19 images was recorded and plotted graphically . The number of ﬁlaments in the two conditions is signiﬁcantly different ( p % 0 . 0001 ) by unpaired Student’s t test . Mean 6 SD is shown . ( D ) Peptides corresponding to residues 501 – 528 were synthesized ( PP ) , and a mutant peptide was also generated with PP - AA changes in posi - tions 4 and 5 of each 5 3 PP tract ( AA ) . Different concentrations of peptide were incubated with 5 m M actin in the presence of pyrene - actin and 25 mM KCl . ( E ) A Las17PP mutant was generated ( PP506 , 507AA ; L - PPmut ) . Wild - type and mutant Las17PP ( GST tag removed ) were incubated at 0 . 14 m M with 3 m M actin in a pyrene - actin assay . ( F ) WASP - PP was expressed and incubated with 5 m M actin at a range of concentrations from 0 . 2 to 0 . 7 m M in a pyrene - actin assay in - cluding 25 mM KCl . ( G ) Actin ﬁlaments formed by WASP - PP were visualized by electron microscopy and are similar to those induced by salt . Scale bar represents 0 . 2 m m . to contribute signiﬁcantly to the extent of polymerization observed in vitro ( Figures 1B and 2E ) . The effect of a complete Las17 WCA deletion domain has been studied [ 14 ] , but the contribu - tion of the actin - binding WH2 domain alone has not been analyzed . Thus , proline residues 506 and 507 were muta - genized to alanines to disrupt one site of PP - actin binding , and I555 was muta - genized to aspartate to disrupt actin binding through WH2 [ 27 ] . Mutant and wild - type las17 were expressed under control of the Las17 promoter in cells . las17 deletion causes cells to be tem - perature sensitive . This can be rescued by re - expression of LAS17 . Increasingly defective growth was observed for I555D , PP506 , 507AA , the double mutation , and the null strain ( Figure 4A ) . In wild - type cells with normally functioning actin , there were many polarized cortical patches of actin , whereas in las17 deletion strains , there were few , bright cortical spots that were not polarized ( Figure 4B ) . In the mutants , there was a loss in polarity of patches , though unlike in las17 deletion mutants , patches appeared to become smaller and more numerous . Uptake of the ﬂuid phase dye Lucifer yellow is used to indi - cate defects in initial stages of endocytosis and also in later A Novel Actin Nucleation Activity in Yeast WASP 199 stages of trafﬁcking to the vacuole . After incubation with cells expressing LAS17 , dye uptake into large vacuolar structures is observed ( Figure 4C ) . In las17 deletion , there is greatly reduced dye uptake , though endosomal structures can be seen , indicating that some dye is endocytosed but then unable to undergo subsequent trafﬁcking . In the single mutants , an increase in plasma membrane and endosomal staining is observed . Signiﬁcantly , the double mutant has a phenotype highly reminiscent of the null strain , indicating that the two actin - binding sites together contribute the majority of Las17 function during endocytosis . Mutations in Las17PP and Las17 - WH2 Cause Different Defects in Endocytic Invagination Live - cell imaging and analysis of single endocytic events has been highly informative about stages of endocytosis at which a protein functions [ 28 , 29 ] . In order to determine whether dis - tinct endocytic defects were caused by the proline or WH2 mutations , the behavior of an endocytic reporter , Sla1 - mRFP , was analyzed in cells expressing wild - type or mutant las17 . As shown in Figure 5A , patch tracking and kymographs from analysis of movies reveal differences in the effects of mutants . Whereas I555D appears to cause a defect during the invagina - tion stage , the effect of the proline mutants appears to precede this stage , with a defect in the ability to stabilize the patch posi - tion . The double mutant shows no invaginations . Analysis of patch lifetime ( Figure 5B ) and patch intensity ( Figure 5C ) reiter - ates the importance of the PP residues in Las17 function . In particular , in the absence of functional WH2 , Sla1 - mRFP appears to be able to be recruited and stay at the site appropri - ately , though the time taken for invagination is prolonged . In contrast , in the PP506 , 507AA mutant , Sla1 - mRFP takes a longer time to reach maximum recruitment at the site , indi - cating an earlier defect in endocytic patch function . Discussion Overall , our data demonstrate the presence of a novel actin - binding site in yeast Las17 / WASP , within which proline resi - dues play a central role in the binding interaction . Analysis of WASP - PP indicates that this region can also interact directly with actin , supporting the idea that PP domains may represent an evolutionarily conserved actin - binding site . The PP binding site on actin resides between subdomains III and IV of actin and is thus distinct from the WH2 - domain actin - binding site . This study has focused on the PP - actin - binding interaction within the context of the yeast Las17 protein . Previous studies demonstrated that the Las17 WCA domain interacts with actin and Arp2 / 3 to promote nucleation and polymerization , and this was assumed to be the primary function of the protein . It was therefore unexpected when deletion of the WCA domain or just the Arp2 / 3 - binding acidic domain gave only subtle phenotypes in vivo [ 13 , 14 ] , contrasting greatly with the slow - growing , temperature - sensitive , endocytically defective las17 deletion strain [ 11 ] and suggesting that other regions of Las17 were critical to its function in vivo . Our data reveal a novel actin - binding region within PP tracts of Las17 . When PP and WH2 mutations are combined , the cell phenotype is similar to the null , suggesting that the two sites contribute in an additive way to supply the major part of Las17 function . The severity of the PP mutation for growth , and the phenotype of the endocytic patch behavior , showing extensive lateral movement prior to invagination , suggests that the function of the PP site acts prior to that of the WCA domain . We propose a model outlined in Figure 6 . Brieﬂy , on arrival at the plasma membrane , the PP - rich region of Las17 is able to mediate multiple interactions with actin and thereby greatly increase the chances of nucleus formation by constraining movement of individual monomers . In this way , the region could act in a similar manner to the tandem WH2 - domain nucleators [ 7 , 27 ] . Actin ﬁlaments are generated , which from electron micros - copy appear to be unbranched . These ﬁlaments then recruit Arp2 / 3 and possibly myosins to the endocytic site . Arp2 / 3 , in conjunction with Las17 , is then able to trigger a burst of actin polymerization to drive invagination of the membrane . How - ever , the function of PP - driven actin nucleation does not appear to be simply generation of ﬁlaments for Arp2 / 3 recruit - ment . The actin formed at this stage appears to be critical for corralling the early proteins at the endocytic site , such that when PP sites are mutagenized , the endocytic site is observed to show erratic movement in the plane of the membrane . It is also possible that this actin corral serves as a platform against which to exert force during invagination against cell turgor [ 30 ] . Figure 3 . Las17PP Binds to Actin in a Region between Subdomains III and IV ( A ) Yeast two - hybrid plasmids expressing 27 different actin alleles were tested for their ability to bind Las17PP . All except two of these actin alleles could interact with Las17PP . The noninteracting alleles were act1 - 104 and act1 - 111 . ( B ) Structure of actin depicting the 27 alleles tested . Front and back views are shown . Interacting alleles are shown in green and noninteracting alleles in red . ( C ) Filament model of actin depicting the act1 - 104 mutated residues in red and act1 - 111 residues in blue . Current Biology Vol 23 No 3 200 In previous reports , it has been shown that the proline - rich region of Las17 contributes positively to actin nucleation and polymerization [ 15 , 31 ] . However , other in vitro experiments re - vealed that addition of the SH3 - domain - containing proteins Sla1 and Bbc1 had an inhibitory effect , leading to a model in which Las17 is proposed to be recruited to the membrane and then held in an inhibited state until SH3 binding is released . This appears incompatible with our data in which Las17 PP function is required to generate actin ﬁlaments at an early stage of endocytosis , prior to invagination . However , in the previous experiments , the SH3 domains were added in excess of the concentration of Las17 [ 15 , 31 ] , which may allow binding of SH3 domains to a greater number of proline tracts , thus effectively outcompeting any actin - binding function of the PP domain . In both reported cases , there is a level of Arp2 / 3 and Las17 nucleation that does not appear to be inhibited by SH3 - domain addition , and it is likely that this is the function attributable to the WCA domain . In vivo , the levels of Las17 are considered to be higher than those of these SH3 - domain - con - taining proteins [ 32 ] , making an inhibitory function less likely . Our data provide an alternative interpretation of the in vitro data and allow a simpler explanation for the function of the early Las17 recruitment to endocytic sites . As well as identifying the PP domain as a new actin - binding region in Las17 , we also demonstrated that the equivalent domain in WASP , the mammalian homolog of Las17 , is able to interact with actin to promote polymerization . Although a nucleation activity was not observed in the pyrene - based assay , ﬁlaments could be generated in very low - salt condi - tions as shown by electron microscopy ( Figure 1 ) , suggesting the possibility that under appropriate conditions , the domain might nucleate ﬁlaments . Alternatively , the PP tracts could Figure 4 . The Las17PP Mutant Has Defects in Growth , Actin Organization , and Endocytosis Strains in which las17 is deleted were trans - formed with plasmids carrying wild - type LAS17 , las17 I555D , las17 PP506 , 507AA , las17 I555D + PP506 , 507AA , or an empty plasmid . Expression levels of mutants were similar to wild - type ( data not shown ) . ( A ) Strains were spotted at 10 - fold dilutions onto plates and incubated for 48 hr at 30 (cid:1) C or 37 (cid:1) C . ( B ) Rhodamine - phalloidin staining was used to determine F - actin organization in cells at 30 (cid:1) C . The percentage of cells with polarized actin patches , deﬁned as > 75 % patches in the bud , was quantiﬁed from three independent experi - ments ( n R 200 ) .

The proportion of cells showing plasma membrane staining from three or more experiments ( n R 100 cells ) is shown below the images . act to deliver actin monomers to actively growing ﬁlament ends . This work opens many new avenues for research and also poses new ques - tions . Foremost among these are the structural considerations for how PP tracts interact with actin and whether additional residues are involved in deﬁning the afﬁnity of the interaction . Furthermore , mutation of Las17 PP and WCA domains appears to cause distinct phenotypes , indicating sequential function . The nature of the proteins or modiﬁcations that regulate these actin - based functions is unknown , though it seems likely that this will be a possible role for some of the Las17 SH3 - domain interactions . Finally , it is clear that proline tracts are found in many proteins . Although the nature of the minimal component for actin binding is not yet known , it is striking that 5 of the 8 pro - teins with two or more 5 3 PP are known actin nucleators , which is highly suggestive of the importance of the tract as we have described . Addressing the function of proline tracts not simply as proﬁlin or SH3 - binding sites but as in - dependent actin - binding motifs in both characterized ( e . g . , Bni1 ) and uncharacterized proteins is likely to yield important new insights .

Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was puriﬁed and gel ﬁltered as described previously [ 34 ] . Peptide was synthesized to > 95 % purity by Pi Proteomics ( Huntsville , AL ) . See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for sequence . Actin Assays For G - actin - binding assays , glutathione beads with GST fusions were incu - bated with 5 m M G - actin + 10 % ﬂuorescent Alexa 568 actin in G buffer . Binding was assessed using ﬂuorescence microscopy . High - speed pellet - ing assays were performed as described previously [ 34 ] . Brieﬂy , 5 m M actin was incubated alone or with varying amounts of Las17 fragment as indi - cated . Polymerization salts , 10 3 KME ( 500 mM KCL , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA , 100mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] ) , were added to 1 3 , and after 2 hr , samples were centrifuged at 350 , 000 3 g . For ﬂuorometry assays , 370 m l assays used 3 – 5 m M actin as indicated . Pyrene - actin was added to 5 % , mixed thoroughly , and added to the ﬂuorometry cuvette . Polymerization salts were mixed with Las17PP , WASP - PP , peptide , or G buffer to give ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 5 3 KME before reading ﬂuorescence . Polymerization was observed in a Cary Eclipse ﬂuorometer ( emission 364 nm , slit 10 nm round ; excitation 385 nm , slit 20 nm ) . Electron microscopy was performed using assays set up as for pelleting . Samples were adsorbed on carbon - coated copper grids and stained with 0 . 75 % uranyl formate . Images were recorded on a Philips CM100 electron microscope using a Gatan MultiScan 794 CCD camera . Fluorescence Microscopy Fluorescence microscopy was performed on an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope , and data were deconvolved using AutoQuant software ( Media Cybernetics ) . For live - cell imaging , cells were visualized after growing to early log phase . The distance of moving ﬂuorescence spots was measured , and arbitrary proﬁle of intensity values , image coordinates , and tracking of patchmovementswereestablishedusingImageJ . Imageswereexportedas TIFF ﬁles and assembled using Adobe Photoshop CS2 . Kymographs were assembled using ImageJ . Statistical analysis of lifetimes was performed using GraphPad Prism software . Lucifer yellow uptake assays were per - formed as described previously [ 35 ] except that incubations were for 90 min . Rhodamine - phalloidin staining of actin structures was performed as described previously [ 36 ] .

This work was Figure5 . TheLas17PPMutantHasDefectsinthe Behavior of Single Endocytic Patches Behavior of Sla1 - mRFP - containing endocytic patches was analyzed from movies of wild - type or Las17 PP506 , 507AA mutant cells . ( A ) Spot tracking was used to monitor movement ofindividualpatches . Threerepresentativetracks are shown for each strain . Green indicates assembly start point ; red indicates disassembly point . Movement and behavior of the patches are also depicted in kymographs below the tracks . The percent of assembled patches that invaginate prior to disassembly was recorded ( n R 100 ) . ( B ) Lifetime of Sla1 - mRFP was measured in the presence of wild - type or mutant Las17 . Error bars are SD of the mean lifetime . Signiﬁcance of differences was analyzed by Student’s t test ; * * * p < 0 . 0001 . ( C ) Fluorescence intensity was analyzed over the patch lifetime for Sla1 - mRFP . Shown is the average of seven patches normalized to the wild - type maximum intensity value . Figure 6 . Proposed Model for Stages of Las17 Function At early stages of endocytosis , coat proteins arrive at sites on the plasma membrane but their positionisnothighlyrestricted . Followingrecruit - ment of Las17 through interaction with one of its many binding partners , the PP region is active and able to nucleate formation of actin ﬁlaments that serve as a corral to stabilize the site . The ﬁla - ments also serve to recruit Arp2 / 3 , which can then interact with Las17 and type 1 myosins to promote an inward burst of actin polymerization required to drive membrane invagination .
