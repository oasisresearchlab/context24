Secondary household transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) was studied in 114 house - holds involving 417 contacts . The attack rate was low ( 6 . 2 % ) . Occupation of the index case was the factor that most influenced household transmission ( adjusted hazard ratio for healthcare workers 0 . 157 ; 95 % confidence interval 0 . 042 to 0 . 588 ) . S evere acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) is an emerg - ing infectious disease caused by the SARS - associated coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) ( 1 ) . Attack rates are > 50 % in hospitals ( 2 ) . A similar trend was seen in Singapore , with SARS spreading to five hospitals and two Specialty Centres within 8 weeks ( 3 ) . This rapid rate of transmission caused a national health alert and resulted in large amounts of manpower and resources being deployed . On the other hand , transmission within the household was less efficient . We , therefore , examined the attack rate and the factors influencing secondary transmission of SARS in Singapore households . Data on probable SARS cases were collected by Singapore’s Ministry of Health Epidemiology Unit , Singapore . The case definition of probable SARS was in accordance with the World Health Organization ( WHO ) ( 4 ) . Probable SARS cases that were also a household index were identified by using the definition that follow . A household was defined as a residential place with a unique address . A household index was a person with probable SARS and the first person to introduce SARS into the household . A household contact was defined as a person living in the same household as the household index . Demographic and clinical data were collected . For the household index , the following information was collected : age , sex , if the household index was a healthcare worker ( defined as a person who works in a healthcare setting ) , number of days spent at home after onset of symptoms , and number of contacts in household . For household con - tacts , the following information was collected : age , sex , if the contact was a healthcare worker , and if the contact was a family member . The week of the SARS outbreak in Singapore was also evaluated to see if there was a time trend in the risk for transmission . All household contacts were followed prospectively for ( 1 ) clinical symptoms until 20 days after the last contact with the household index , and ( 2 ) evidence of positive PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) or serologic test for SARS - CoV ( according to criteria set by WHO ) . Secondary household transmission was said to have occurred if the household contact fulfilled the case definition of probable SARS ( 4 ) . Households were excluded if the household index lived alone , the household index did not spend time at home after onset of symptoms , if the period of household expo - sure to the index was not clearly defined ( e . g . , not isolated promptly upon hospital admission ) , or more than one index lived in the household ( shown through contact trac - ing or onset < 2 days after SARS developed in the first per - son in the household ) . Statistical tests ( Mann - Whitney , chi - square and Fisher exact test ) were used to test for associations when appro - priate . The Cox regression model was used to evaluate the influence of demographic and clinical factors on second - ary household transmission . All analyses were performed with SPSS version 11 . 5 . There were 205 probable SARS cases in Singapore dur - ing the period between February 24 and April 29 , 2003 . These 205 probable SARS cases resided in 163 house - holds . A total of 114 households fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria . Forty - nine households were excluded ( 12 because the index lived alone , 20 because the house - hold index did not spend time at home after onset of symp - toms , 10 because the period of household exposure to the index was not clearly defined , 7 because more than one index patient was in that household ) . Seventy - two of the 114 household indexes ( 63 . 2 % ) were healthcare workers .

From these 114 households , 417 household contacts were identified and followed prospectively . Secondary transmission occurred in only 14 households ( 12 . 3 % ) , giv - ing rise to 26 household cases of probable SARS . Household transmissions occurred within 2 – 11 days ( mean 5 . 3 ± 2 . 6 days ) after the onset of symptoms in the index cases . Symptoms developed in eight contacts ( 30 % ) while on home quarantine orders . The remaining 18 were not given home quarantine orders because they were either already in hospital with SARS or were not identified by contact tracing . The mean length of stay at home after onset of symptoms was not statistically different between the home - quarantined group and the group not quarantined at home ( p = 0 . 09 ) . The secondary household attack rate was thus low ( 6 . 2 % [ 95 % confidence interval 3 . 9 % to 8 . 6 % ] ) and con - curs with that reported by Beijing , China ( 5 ) . In that study , the attack rate was 4 . 6 % in persons who had contact with a probable SARS case - patient during the symptomatic period and lived in the same residence ( which included some per - sons who visited or cared for a SARS patient ) . These find - ings are in contrast to the high attack rate seen in the health - care setting ( 6 ) . One possible explanation for this difference is the phase of the illness . SARS case - patients in the house - hold tend to be in the early phase of illness whereas SARS case - patients in the healthcare settings tend to be in the later phase . In addition , coexisting conditions and invasive pro - cedures done within the hospital setting may also influence risk of transmitting disease ( 7 ) . The low rate of household transmission suggests that the magnitude of a household outbreak would be less than a hospital - based one , which could help allay public fear and panic , a societal concern evident in the recent outbreak ( 2 , 7 ) . This knowledge will also enable public health offi - cers to develop a more sensitive and responsive surveil - lance system . As the expected attack rate is known , health - care professionals can be prepared early if the observed attack rate in the households is higher than predicted , allowing rational rather than empirical implementation of public health measures and justify rapid and aggressive investigative and containment measures needed to prevent a large outbreak . These considerations are particularly important for countries with limited healthcare and fiscal resources . In Singapore , we learned the usefulness of edu - cating persons on the need and means of doing daily tem - perature monitoring , to have a centralized temperature recording database for hospital staff and patients so that a cluster of fevers could be spotted early , to evaluate symp - tomatic hospital staff in designated hospital clinics , and to trace contacts by using many resources including the police and army . The authorities in Hong Kong did not have the benefit of this information as little was known then about SARS . Perhaps in the future , such knowledge will help prevent another situation similar to that seen in Amoy Gardens , Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( 8 ) . Factors influencing household transmission were also studied in the Singapore cohort . Univariate analysis ( Table 1 ) showed that household index cases were less likely to transmit SARS to their household contacts if they were younger or were healthcare workers . Contacts were more likely to develop SARS if they were family members or nonhealthcare workers . The Cox regression model ( Figure and Table 2 ) verified two of these four factors , index occu - pation and age . The most consistent and important factor influencing household transmission was whether or not the index case was a healthcare worker ( adjusted hazard ratio 0 . 157 ; 95 % CI 0 . 042 to 0 . 588 ) . This was independent of length of exposure or demographics . The reason for this finding was not evident from the data available . A difference in social behavior between healthcare worker and nonhealthcare worker is a possible explanation for this disparity in risks of household transmission .

In addition , better health and disease prevention knowledge may influence the efficacy of such practices . Qualitative differences in social behavior between health - care worker and nonhealthcare worker should be investi - gated , as this knowledge may be useful in containing future SARS outbreaks . The risk for household transmission was also lower if the index case was younger . This finding may correlate with milder disease seen in younger persons and lower infectivity . The week of the outbreak did not significantly influence the model , indicating the lack of a time trend in household transmission . In conclusion , this study is the first to characterize sec - ondary household transmission of SARS . We have shown that the attack rate is low and the most significant factor influencing household transmission was the occupation of the index case . The results of this study challenge some of the current concepts about SARS . Given that the study numbers are not large , a multicenter analysis of the past SARS cases would be helpful in verifying these findings .
