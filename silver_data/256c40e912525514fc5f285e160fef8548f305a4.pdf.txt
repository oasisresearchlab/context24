The gels were prepared using N , N 0 - methylenebis ( acrylamide ) ( BAAm ) as a crosslinker at a ﬁxed initial monomer concentration but at various crosslink densities . Ammonium persulfate - N , N , N 0 , N 0 - tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED ) redox initiator system was used to initiate the polymerization reactions as well as to create charged groups in the aged gels . The gels were characterized by elasticity tests and by light scattering measurements at a gel state just after their preparation . Elasticity measurements show that 91 – 94 % of the crosslinker molecules used in the hydrogel preparation were wasted in ineffective crosslinks . Debye – Bueche analysis of the light scattering data indicates frozen concentration ﬂuctuations within the gel samples , which increase continuously with increasing crosslink density of the hydrogels . This phenomenon was explained with the multiple crosslinking reactions leading to the formation of highly crosslinked regions in the ﬁnal hydrogel . The extent of concentration ﬂuctuations was found to decrease drastically with increasing time of aging of gels in the synthesis reactor , indicating that the hydrolysis of amide groups into carboxylate anions facilitates the homogenization of the gel samples . A thermodynamic model was developed to explain the experimental observations in terms of the osmotic pressure of counterions in the aged gels . q 2003 Elsevier Ltd . All rights reserved .

They are usually prepared by free - radical crosslinking copolymerization of a monovinyl monomer with a divinyl monomer ( crosslinker ) in a homogeneous solution . Swelling properties and the elastic behavior of hydrogels have been intensively studied in the last four decades . However , theories are still unable to predict their physical properties from the synthesis con - ditions . This is due to the several non - idealities of the gel formation system such as the different and conversion - dependent reactivities of the vinyl groups , cyclization , multiple crosslinking , and diffusion - controlled reactions [ 1 , 2 ] . Hydrogels formed in such a non - ideal picture necessarily include defects affecting their physical properties such as swelling , elasticity , transparency , and permeability . One of the network defects , which have been extensively studied , is the gel inhomogeneity [ 3 , 4 ] . In contrast to the ideal gels with a homogeneous distribution of crosslinks throughout the gel sample , real gels always exhibit an inhomogeneous crosslink density distribution , known as the spatial gel inhomogeneity . Since the gel inhomogeneity is closely connected to the spatial concentration ﬂuctuations , scattering methods such as light scattering [ 5 , 6 ] , small - angle X - ray scattering [ 5 , 7 ] , and small - angle neutron scattering [ 8 – 10 ] have been employed to investigate the spatial inhomogeneities . The gel inhomogeneity can be manifested by comparing the scattering intensities from the gel and from a semi - dilute solution of the same polymer at the same concentration . The scattering intensity from gels is always larger than that from the polymer solution . The excess scattering over the scattering from polymer solution is related to the degree of the inhomogeneities in gels . The spatial inhomogeneity in acrylamide ( AAm ) - based hydrogels has been investigated as a function of a number of parameters , such as the crosslink density [ 11 – 14 ] , the type 0032 - 3861 / 03 / $ - see front matter q 2003 Elsevier Ltd .

Okay ) . of the crosslinker [ 15 ] , the ionization degree [ 3 , 4 , 16 ] , the swelling ratio [ 4 , 17 ] , and the temperature [ 18 ] . In general , the gel inhomogeneity increases signiﬁcantly with the crosslink density . A reduced reactivity of the crosslinker used in the hydrogel preparation also leads to a higher degree of inhomogeneity . On the other hand , the inhom - ogeneity decreases with the ionization degree of gels . An enhancement of the excess scattering is generally observed , if the gel swells beyond its swelling degree after preparation . It is well known that a poly ( acrylamide ) ( PAAm ) gel made by redox polymerization changes to a partially charged gel due to hydrolysis of its amide groups [ 19 ] . Ilavsky et al . showed that the gels or solutions of PAAm prepared using N , N , N 0 , N 0 - tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED ) as the reducing component of the initiator system have a pH value between 8 and 9 [ 20 ] . At this pH value , the amide groups on the PAAm chains gradually convert into carboxylate anions with increasing time of aging in the polymerization reactor [ 20 ] . The degree of hydrolysis in PAAm solutions has been quantitatively studied by Zurimendi et al . [ 21 ] . Mallo et al . investigated the extent of hydrolysis in PAAm gels as a function of aging time [ 22 ] . It was shown that the hydrolysis proceeds rather time linearly and results in increase in the swelling degree and in the cooperative diffusion coefﬁcient of aged gels . Takata et al . compared inhomogeneities of a one - month aged PAAm gel with that after a gelation time of 20 h [ 23 ] . It was shown that the static inhomogeneities and dynamic ﬂuctuations are smaller in the aged gel compared to the gel after preparation . Here , we report a systematic study of the effect of aging time of PAAm gels on the extent of spatial gel inhomogen - eity . For this purpose , we prepared a series of PAAm gels of various crosslink densities . The gels were characterized at various aging times by static light scattering measurements at a gel state just after their preparation . An equivalent semi - dilute PAAm solution served as a reference in the under - standing of the inhomogeneities in gels . The excess scattering from the gels is taken as a measure of their inhomogeneity . A thermodynamic model was developed to explain the observed phenomena in terms of the osmotic pressure of mobile counterions in the hydrolyzed PAAm gels . 2 . Experimental 2 . 1 . Synthesis of hydrogels AAm ( Merck ) , BAAm ( Merck ) , ammonium persulfate ( APS , Merck ) , potassium persulfate ( KPS , Merck ) and TEMED were used as received . PAAm gels were prepared by free - radical crosslinking copolymerization of AAm and BAAm in an aqueous solution at 24 8 C in the presence of 2 . 63 mM APS initiator and 0 . 375 v / v % TEMED accel - erator . The initial monomer concentration was ﬁxed at 5 w / v % while the amount of the crosslinker BAAm was varied between at 0 and 3 mol % . The reaction time was one day . Details about the gel synthesis have been reported elsewhere [ 24 , 25 ] . PAAm solutions were prepared in the same way as the gels , but BAAm was not added to the initial mixture . For comparison , gels and solutions of PAAm were prepared under the same initial monomer concentration except that TEMED was not used . The polymerization and crosslinking reactions were initiated at 40 8 C using 0 . 474 mM KPS initiator . The degree of dilution of the networks after their preparation was denoted by v 02 ; the volume fraction of crosslinked polymer after the gel preparation . In order to determine v 02 ; PAAm hydrogels after preparation were ﬁrst swollen in water to extract non - polymerizable or soluble components and then dried at 90 8 C under vacuum for at least two weeks . Assuming that the monomer conversions were complete after the crosslinking copolymerization , the theoretical value of v 02 can also be calculated from the initial molar concentration of the monomers [ 24 , 25 ] . Measure - ments showed that the experimental value of v 02 is close to its theoretical value of 0 . 037 , indicating that , under the reaction conditions , the monomer conversions and the gel fractions were complete . 2 . 2 . Mechanical measurements Uniaxial compression measurements were performed on gels just after their preparation . All the mechanical measurements were conducted in a thermostated room of 24 ^ 0 . 5 8 C . The stress – strain isotherms were measured by using an apparatus previously described [ 26 ] . Brieﬂy , a cylindrical gel sample of about 6 mm in diameter and 7 mm in length was placed on a digital balance ( Sartorius BP221S , readability and reproducibility : 0 . 1 mg ) . A load was transmitted vertically to the gel through a road ﬁtted with a PTFE end - plate . The compressional force acting on the gel was calculated from the reading of the balance . The resulting deformation was measured after 20 s of relaxation by using a digital comparator ( IDC type Digimatic Indicator 543 - 262 , Mitutoyo Co . ) , which was sensitive to displace - ments of 10 2 3 mm . The measurements were conducted up to about 15 % compression . Reversibility of the isotherms was tested by recording the force and the resulting deformation during both force - increasing and force - decreasing processes . The two processes yielded almost identical stress – strain relations . From the repeated measurements , the standard deviations in the modulus value were less than 3 % . The sample weight loss during the measurements due to water evaporation was found to be negligible . The elastic modulus G 0 was determined from the slope of linear dependence f ¼ G 0 ð a 2 a 2 2 Þ ; where f is the force acting per unit cross - sectional area of the undeformed gel specimen , and a is the deformation ratio ( deformed length / initial length ) .

Light scattering experiments For the light scattering measurements , the crosslinking polymerizations were carried out in the light scattering vials . All glassware was kept dustfree by rinsing in hot acetone prior using . The solutions were ﬁltered through membrane ﬁlters ( pore size ¼ 0 . 2 m m ) directly into the vials . This process was carried out in a dustfree glovebox . All the gels subjected to light scattering measurements were clear and appeared homogeneous to the eye . For the calculation of excess scattering from gels , all the cross - linking polymerizations were repeated under the same experimental conditions except that the crosslinker BAAm was not used . The aging of both PAAm gels and solutions was carried out at 24 ^ 0 . 5 8 C in vials , in which they were formed . The light scattering measurements were carried out at 24 ^ 0 . 5 8 C using a commercial multi - angle light scattering DAWN EOS ( Wyatt Technologies Corporation ) equipped with a vertically polarized 30 mW Gallium – arsenide laser operating at l ¼ 690 nm and 18 simultaneously detected scattering angles . The scattered light intensities from gels and solutions of PAAm of various aging times were recorded from 42 . 8 to 142 . 5 8 , which correspond to the scattering vector q range 8 . 8 £ 10 2 4 2 2 . 3 £ 10 2 3 A˚ 2 1 , where q ¼ ð 4 p n = l Þ sin ð u = 2 Þ ; u the scattering angle , l the wavelength of the incident light in vacuum , n the refractive index of the medium , which is 1 . 34 . The light scattering system was calibrated against a toluene standard . During the measurements with gel samples , the vial was rotated eight times between each cycle of data sampling . 3 . Results and discussion We discuss the results of our experiments in three subsections . In Section 3 . 1 , spatial inhomogeneity in PAAm gels of various crosslink densities is discussed . In Section 3 . 2 , the variation of the extent of the gel inhomogeneity depending on the time of aging of gels is discussed . In Section 3 . 3 , a thermodynamic model is presented to interpret the experimental observations . 3 . 1 . Effect of crosslink density In Fig . 2 , the elastic modulus of gels after preparation G 0 is shown as a function of the crosslinker ( BAAm ) content . As expected , G 0 is an increasing function of the crosslinker concentration . Assuming that all BAAm molecules used in the hydrogel synthesis participate in forming effective crosslinks , theoretical elastic modulus G theo of the hydrogels can be calculated as [ 27 , 28 ] : G theo ¼ A 2 r X M r RTv 02 ð 1 Þ where the front factor A equals to 1 for an afﬁne network and 1 2 2 = f for a phantom network , f is the functionality of the crosslinks , r is the polymer density ( 1 . 35 g / ml ) and M r is the Fig . 1 .

Previous works show that the phantom network theory of elasticity adequately describes the stress – strain behavior of PAAm gels [ 29 ] . Assuming phantom network behavior ð f ¼ 4 Þ ; G theo of the hydrogels calculated using Eq . ( 1 ) are also shown in Fig . 2 as the dotted curve . It is seen that G theo is much higher than G 0 of the hydrogels . The crosslinking efﬁciency of BAAm e xl ¼ G 0 = G theo ; that is the fraction of BAAm forming effective crosslinks is shown in the Figure as open symbols . e xl is in the range 0 . 06 – 0 . 09 , indicating that 91 – 94 % of BAAm used in the hydrogel preparation were wasted . This value is in good agreement with that found from the equilibrium swelling measurements of gels [ 30 , 31 ] as well as from the determination of the pendant vinyl group content of pregel polymers [ 32 , 33 ] . This high fraction of wasted BAAm originates from the characteristics of AAm - BAAm copoly - merization [ 1 ] . As reported in the literature , the reactivity ratios of AAm and BAAm monomers are 0 . 57 and 3 . 4 , respectively [ 34 ] . Thus , in copolymerization , the growing chains in the pregel regime are rich in BAAm units . Furthermore , these chains are highly diluted by the solvent and the monomer at low conversion so that cyclization predominates in the early stages of the reaction . Present results indeed show that a signiﬁcant fraction of BAAm is consumed by cyclization reactions during the gel formation process . Light scattering measurements were carried out on hydrogels prepared in the range of BAAm between 0 and 2 mol % . The hydrogels prepared above 2 mol % BAAm became ﬁrst translucent and then opaque during the gel formation reactions . It is obvious that these gels have heterogeneities in a spatial scale of submicrometer to micrometer . Therefore , only gel samples with less than 2 % BAAm were subjected to light scattering measurements . The measurements were conducted after one day of polymerization time . Excess scattering intensities from gels R ex ð q Þ were calculated as R ex ð q Þ ¼ R gel ð q Þ 2 R sol ð q Þ ; where R gel ð q Þ and R sol ð q Þ are the Rayleigh ratios for gel and polymer solution , respectively . Fig . 3A and B show R gel ð q Þ and R ex ð q Þ vs the scattering vector q plots for PAAm hydrogels of various BAAm contents , respect - ively . It is seen that the gels scatter much more light than the corresponding polymer solution of the same concentration . This is in accord with the results reported earlier [ 5 , 14 ] . Interestingly , even the presence of a small amount of the crosslinker BAAm results in increased scattered light intensities from the gel samples . The excess scattering from gels increases with increasing BAAm content . Since R ex ð q Þ is a measure of the spatial inhomogeneity in a gel , this indicates that the PAAm gel becomes more inhomogeneous with increasing BAAm concentration . Furthermore , at low BAAm content , the excess scattering is nearly q - independent but for higher BAAm content , the q dependence becomes more pronounced . To compare the excess scattering of different gels , we will focus on the scattering intensity measured at a ﬁxed scattering vector q ¼ 1 £ 10 2 3 A˚ 2 1 . Fig . 4 shows the excess scattering at q ¼ 1 £ 10 2 3 A˚ 2 1 ð R ex ; q Þ plotted as a function of BAAm % . R ex ; q increases ﬁrst slightly up to about 1 . 5 mol % BAAm but then rapidly increases with a further increase in BAAm concentration . As shown in the inset to Fig . 4 , a good linear behavior was obtained if the data points are redrawn in a semi - logarithmic plot , indicating an exponential law between R ex ; q and BAAm % . This suggests the occurrence of a phase separation in the gel samples as the crosslinker content is increased . To interpret light scattering results from gels , several functional forms of excess scattering R ex ð q Þ have been proposed empirically , i . e . Debye – Bueche [ 35 – 38 ] , Guinier [ 39 – 42 ] , and Ornstein – Zernicke functions [ 39 – 43 ] . For Fig . 3 . Scattering light intensities from gels R gel ð q Þ ( A ) and the excess scattering R ex ð q Þ ( B ) vs scattering vector q plots for PAAm gels of various crosslinker contents . BAAm mol % ¼ 0 ( W ) , 0 . 10 ( X ) , 0 . 23 ( O ) , 0 . 54 ( K ) , 1 . 14 ( P ) , 1 . 46 ( L ) , 1 . 86 ( V ) , and 1 . 94 ( S ) . M . Y . Kizilay , O . Okay / Polymer 44 ( 2003 ) 5239 – 5250 5242 example , the excess scattering was given by the Debye – Bueche function as : R ex ð q Þ ¼ 4 p K j 3 k h 2 l ð 1 þ q 2 j 2 Þ 2 ð 2 Þ where K being the optical constant , K ¼ 8 p 2 n 2 l 2 4 ; j is the correlation length of the scatterers , and k h 2 l is the mean square ﬂuctuation of the refractive index . Note that the correlation length j of the Debye – Bueche theory is a characteristic length scale in the gel . It shows the average distance over which the local variation in the polymer concentration can be considered not to change appreciably . Thus , j is a measure of the spatial extent of the ﬂuctuation [ 37 , 38 ] . The larger the j values , the larger are the extension of the inhomogeneities . Since scatterers in gels are highly crosslinked regions , the correlation length corresponds to the size of these regions . According to Eq . ( 2 ) , the slope and the intercept of R ex ð q Þ 2 1 = 2 vs q 2 plot ( Debye – Bueche plot ) give j and k h 2 l of a gel sample , i . e . ð 2a Þ j ¼ a b (cid:1) (cid:2) 0 : 5 ð 2b Þ and k h 2 l ¼ ð 4 p Ka 1 : 5 b 0 : 5 Þ 2 1 ð 2c Þ In Fig . 5 , some of the data points are replotted in the form of Debye – Bueche plots . It is seen that straight lines are obtained in this analysis , indicating that the Debye – Bueche function works well . In fact , ln R ex ð q Þ vs q 2 and R ex ð q Þ 2 1 vs q 2 plots also give straight lines , implying that the Guinier and Ornstein – Zernicke functions also work well . The values of j and k h 2 l were calculated from the Debye – Bueche analysis . The standard deviations in j and k h 2 l values were always less than 5 % . The correlation length of the scatterers j was found to be 16 ^ 3 nm and slightly decreasing function of BAAm concentration . The mean square ﬂuctuations k h 2 l are in the range 10 2 7 – 10 2 5 and they increase with BAAm content . Thus , increasing concentration ﬂuctuations k h 2 l decrease the correlation length j of PAAm gels . This inverse relation between j and k h 2 l was also reported before for PAAm gels [ 5 , 15 ] . This is due to the fact that , increasing crosslink density of the highly crosslinked regions of a gel leads to the deswelling of these regions so that their size j decreases on rising k h 2 l : The semi - logarithmic plot in Fig . 6 showing BAAm % dependence of the mean square ﬂuctuations k h 2 l indicates a power law behavior . Thus , Debye – Bueche method shows that the correlation length , i . e . the extension of the inhomogeneities in PAAm gels slightly decreases while the extent of the ﬂuctuations k h 2 l rapidly increases with increasing BAAm content . Similar results were also obtained by ﬁtting the data to the Guinier and Ornstein – Zernicke functions . As pointed out in the Introduction , cyclization and multiple crosslinking reactions are the main features of the gel formation process of PAAm gels . These reactions are Fig . 4 . The excess scattering R ex ; q measured at q ¼ 1 £ 10 2 3 A˚ 2 1 shown as a function of BAAm mol % . The inset shows the same data in a semi - logarithmic plot . Fig . 5 . Debye – Bueche plots for PAAm gels prepared at various BAAm mol % indicated in the Figure . M . Y . Kizilay , O . Okay / Polymer 44 ( 2003 ) 5239 – 5250 5243 schematically illustrated in Fig . 7 . With cyclization , the cycle is formed when the macroradical attacks the pendant vinyl groups in the same kinetic chain ; while with multiple crosslinking , it is formed if the radical attacks double bonds pendant on other chains already chemically connected with the growing radical [ 44 – 47 ] . Important point is that cycles are intramolecular links and therefore , they do not contribute to the rubber elasticity of polymer networks and thus , to the concentration ﬂuctuations of gels . However , multiple crosslinks are elastically effective links in a small region of space . The regions , where the multiple crosslinks form , have a higher crosslink density then do others so that they will not swell as much as the other regions ( Fig . 7 ) . As a result , the inhomogeneous distribution of effective crosslinks and the resulting concentration ﬂuctuations k h 2 l in the hydrogels are a result of multiple crosslinking reactions . At low crosslinker contents , since the local pendant vinyl group concentration surrounding the growing macroradical is relatively low , only a few multiple crosslinks is expected to occur after each crosslinking reaction . However , at high crosslinker contents , the possibility of multiple crosslinkages is enhanced due to the high pendant vinyl group concentration ( Fig . 7 ) . Indeed , previous results show that , at relatively high BAAm contents , about 2 £ 10 3 multiple crosslinks occur after each single crosslink [ 33 ] . This leads to the formation of highly crosslinked regions in the ﬁnal hydrogel . Thus , the higher the crosslinker content , the larger the number of multiple crosslinks will be and the greater the extent of gel inhomogeneity . 3 . 2 . Effect of hydrolysis Hydrolysis of PAAm gels prepared with TEMED is known to proceed almost linearly with the time of aging [ 22 ] . Thus , as the time goes on , more and more AAm units are converted into the acrylic acid ( AAc ) units so that the gel becomes increasingly ionic . Ilavsky et al . showed that the fraction of AAc units increases from 0 to 0 . 052 with increasing aging time up to 103 days while the molar mass of linear PAAm’s prepared under the same experimental condition remains constant [ 20 ] . Their elasticity measure - ments also show that the elastic moduli of gels do not change much with increasing aging time of gels [ 20 ] . Thus , aging of PAAm gels only inﬂuences the hydrolysis degree of the network chains . Fig . 6 .

Okay / Polymer 44 ( 2003 ) 5239 – 5250 5244 In the present work , gels and solutions of PAAm were left in vials at 24 8 C , in which they were formed for various times up to 160 days . The excess scattering intensities from gels with respect to polymer solutions having the same aging time were measured . Fig . 8A – D show R ex ð q Þ vs q plots for PAAm hydrogels at various aging times . BAAm contents of gels are indicated in the Figure . The excess scattering decreases , i . e . PAAm gel becomes increasingly homogeneous with increasing time of aging at all cross - linker contents studied . Furthermore , the excess scattering , which was q - dependent at high crosslinker contents , becomes nearly q - independent at long aging times . In Fig . 9A , the excess scattering R ex ; q at q ¼ 1 £ 10 2 3 A˚ 2 1 is plotted as a function of aging time for various BAAm % . R ex ; q decreases ﬁrst rapidly up to about 30 days then slightly with increasing aging time . The double - logarithmic R ex ; q vs aging time plots given in Fig . 9B show that the decrease in R ex ; q with time i . e . the homogenization of PAAm gels becomes faster as the crosslinker content is increased . The scattered light intensities from aged gels were interpreted using the Debye – Bueche analysis . As in Section 3 . 1 , linear R ex ð q Þ 2 1 = 2 vs q 2 plots were obtained , from which the parameters k h 2 l and j were calculated . k h 2 l and j of gels are collected in Fig . 10 plotted as a function of the aging time . It is seen that , both k h 2 l and j do not change much up to about 5 days . At longer aging times , the correlation length of the scatterers j increases while the mean square ﬂuctuations k h 2 l decrease rapidly . The measurements were also repeated using gel samples prepared without using TEMED . The results obtained at various crosslink densities showed no change in both k h 2 l and j values with the time of aging up to 110 days . Thus , the presence of TEMED , i . e . the hydrolysis is responsible for the homogenization of gels during aging . The experimental results may be attributed to the rearrangement of the network chains in aged gels due to the electrostatic interactions . As the charge density of the network chains increases , they rearrange themselves as far as possible due to the repulsion of the charged groups . Those of the chains in the dense regions , that are relatively mobile , move apart to assume a new structure [ 48 ] . According to this picture , the decrease in excess scattering , that is , the homogenization of gels during aging must proceed faster at low crosslinker contents due to the fact that the more mobile chains can easily move to take this new structure . However , the experimental results show opposite behavior ( Fig . 9B ) . The higher the crosslinker content , the Fig . 8 .

Okay / Polymer 44 ( 2003 ) 5239 – 5250 5245 faster the homogenizing move of the network chains out of the dense regions . Thus , the results cannot be explained with the electrostatic interactions of the charged groups . A more plausible explanation is the swelling of the dense regions of gel due to the inhomogeneous distribution of mobile counterions in aged gels . This is illustrated schematically in Fig . 11 . As shown in Section 3 . 1 , PAAm gel consists of highly crosslinked ( dense ) regions , which are intercon - nected by the less crosslinked ( dilute ) interstitial regions . Thus , the gel consists of regions of high and low polymer concentrations . At a given degree of hydrolysis , the local charge density ( the number of ionic units per unit gel volume ) will thus be higher in the dense regions compared to the dilute regions . Due to the condition of electroneu - trality , the concentration of the mobile counterions will also be higher in the dense regions . This unequal distribution of counterions between the inside and outside the dense regions of gel will create an osmotic pressure resulting in the swelling of the dense regions . This means that , upon ionization , water diffuses from dilute to the dense regions of the gel due to the additional osmotic pressure of excess counterions . As a result , the size of the dense regions j increases while the extent of the concentration ﬂuctuations k h 2 l decreases with increasing degree of hydrolysis . 3 . 3 . Thermodynamic modeling of homogenization of gels during hydrolysis In this section , we present a thermodynamic model to calculate , on a microscopic scale , the concentration ﬂuctuations in gels depending on the degree of hydrolysis . We categorize the various regions of an inhomogeneous gel as being either dense or dilute . Dense regions are highly crosslinked and they are distributed randomly throughout the gel volume . We assume that each dense region of gel is homogeneous and the network chains are long enough to apply the Gaussian statistics . Since the crosslink density of the dense regions is larger than the average , these regions of gel partially shrink to ensure a micro - swelling equilibrium with the solvent in the environment . The dilute region is less crosslinked and the swelling capacity of this region is higher than the degree of dilution after the gel preparation . Thus , this region of gel is not in thermodynamic equilibrium . If a good solvent is added , only the dilute region will swell further to attain the swelling equilibrium . Let us choose randomly a microscopic portion of a gel sample , as illustrated in Fig . 11 . Let v g2 and v s2 be the volume fractions of crosslinked polymer in the dense and dilute regions , respectively , and v ge be the crosslink density of the dense region . Note that , in our notation , the symbols with the superscripts g and s denote the properties of dense and dilute regions , respectively . The equilibrium state properties of the dense region will be analyzed using the Flory – Rehner ( FR ) theory of swelling equilibrium . According to the FR theory , the osmotic pressure p of a gel is the sum of three contributions [ 49 , 50 ] : p ¼ p mix þ p el þ p ion ð 3 Þ where p mix ; p el ; and p ion are the osmotic pressures due to Fig . 10 .

According to the Flory – Huggins ( FH ) theory , p mix is given by [ 27 ] : p mix ¼ 2 RT V 1 ½ ln ð 1 2 v g2 Þ þ v g2 þ x ð v g2 Þ 2 (cid:7) ð 4 Þ where x is the polymer – solvent interaction parameter and V 1 is the molar volume of solvent . The FR and FH theories contain several assumptions that have been the subject of much discussion . The validity of these assumptions is beyond the scope of the present paper . To describe the elastic contribution p el ; we will use the phantom network model for tetrafunctional networks [ 27 ] . Since the dense region of gel is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the solvent , the volume fraction of polymer in the reference state equals to the equilibrium volume fraction of polymer . p el is then given by : p el ¼ 2 1 2 RTv ge v g2 ð 5 Þ During hydrolysis , ﬁxed charges start to appear on the network chains , which are conﬁned to the dense and dilute regions , along with an equal number of counterions . Ionic contribution p ion to the swelling pressure is caused due to the concentration difference of the counterions between the dense and dilute regions of the gel , represented by C g and C s ; respectively : p ion ¼ RT ð C g 2 C s Þ ð 6 Þ The condition of electroneutrality requires the equality C ¼ C fix in both dense and dilute regions of gel , where C fix is the concentration of ﬁxed charges , i . e . C fix ¼ i V 1 y 2 ð 7 Þ where i is the effective charge density , i . e . the mole fraction of the charged units in the network chains . Thus , Eqs . ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) lead to : p ion ¼ iRT V 1 ð v g2 2 v s2 Þ ð 8 Þ According to Eq . ( 8 ) , the osmotic pressure of counterions increases with increasing degree of hydrolysis or , with increasing concentration difference between the dense and dilute regions . Substitution of Eqs . ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 8 ) into Eq . ( 3 ) and since the osmotic pressure p equals to zero at swelling equilibrium , one obtains the following equation for the dense region of an inhomogeneous gel : ln ð 1 2 v g2 Þ þ v g2 þ x ð v g2 Þ 2 þ 0 : 5 V 1 v ge v g2 2 i ð v g2 2 v s2 Þ ¼ 0 ð 9 Þ By substituting i ¼ 0 into Eq . ( 9 ) , one obtains the swelling equation for the dense region of gel before the onset of hydrolysis : ln ð 1 2 v g2 ; 0 Þ þ v g2 ; 0 þ x ð v g2 ; 0 Þ 2 þ 0 : 5 V 1 v ge v g2 ; 0 ¼ 0 ð 9a Þ where the symbols with the subscript 0 denote the initial properties . Due to the concentration difference of mobile counter - ions between the inside and outside the dense region , water diffuses from dilute to the dense region as the degree of hydrolysis increases . As a result , the polymer volume fraction v g2 in the dense region will decrease starting from its initial values of v g2 ; 0 ; while v s2 will increase starting from v s2 ; 0 : Although the network chains in both regions change their conﬁgurations during swelling or shrinking , they are ﬁxed in their locations , i . e . they cannot escape out of their regions . This means that the polymer volumes in both regions remain constant during hydrolysis . If x represents the volume fraction of the dense region in gel , from the material balance , we may write : xv g2 ¼ x 0 v g2 ; 0 ð 10a Þ ð 1 2 x Þ v s2 ¼ ð 1 2 x 0 Þ v s2 ; 0 ð 10b Þ where x 0 is the value of x at i ¼ 0 : Combining Eqs . ( 10a ) and ( 10b ) to eliminate x ; one obtains : v s2 ¼ v s2 ; 0 ð 1 2 x 0 Þ 1 2 x 0 v g2 ; 0 = v g2 ð 11 Þ Simultaneous solutions of Eqs . ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) give the concentration ﬂuctuation ð v g2 2 v s2 Þ in a microscopic portion of a gel sample depending on the degree of hydrolysis . Assuming linear additivity of the refractive indices of the solvent n 1 and the polymer n 2 ; the refractive indices of the dense and dilute regions , N g and N s ; respectively , can then be calculated as follows : N g ¼ D nv g2 þ n 1 ð 12a Þ N s ¼ D nv s2 þ n 1 ð 12b Þ where D n ¼ n 2 2 n 1 : By deﬁning h 2 as the ﬂuctuations in refractive index ð N g 2 N s Þ 2 at a given point of gel , one obtains : h 2 ¼ D n 2 ð v g2 2 v s2 Þ 2 ð 13 Þ which becomes before the onset of hydrolysis : h 20 ¼ D n 2 ð v g2 ; 0 2 v s2 ; 0 Þ 2 ð 13a Þ Note that h 2 represents the refractive index ﬂuctuations for a given spatial conﬁguration in gel , while k h 2 l of the Debye – Bueche theory is the ensemble average measurement , that is , one averaged over a large number of spatial conﬁgur - ations existing in the gel . 3 . 4 . Calculations The system speciﬁc parameters used were n 1 ¼ 1 : 33 ; n 2 ¼ 1 : 5 [ 51 ] , x ¼ 0 : 48 [ 29 , 52 ] , and V 1 ¼ 1 : 8 £ 10 2 5 m 3 mol 2 1 . M . Y . Kizilay , O . Okay / Polymer 44 ( 2003 ) 5239 – 5250 5247 Respective calculations showed that h 2 is rather insensitive to the initial volume fraction of dense regions x 0 : x 0 was set to 0 . 01 for the following calculations . The degree of hydrolysis i ; the crosslink density of the dense region v ge ; and the initial value of the ﬂuctuations h 20 were taken as the independent parameters . The following procedure was used for calculations : ( 1 ) Eq . ( 9a ) was solved for the initial polymer volume fraction in the dense region v g2 ; 0 ; ( 2 ) Eq . ( 13a ) was solved together with the value v g2 ; 0 for the initial polymer volume fraction in the dilute region v s2 ; 0 ; ( 3 ) After ﬁnding the initial concentrations v g2 ; 0 and v s2 ; 0 ; Eqs . ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) were solved simultaneously for v g2 and v s2 as a function of i as the independent parameter . Eq . ( 13 ) was then solved for the ﬂuctuations in the refractive index h 2 : In Fig . 12A , v g2 ( solid curves ) and v s2 ( dotted curves ) vs i plots are presented for various values of v ge : Calculations were for h 20 ¼ 7 £ 10 2 6 : For the same gel systems , h 2 vs i plots are given in Fig . 12B . It is seen that the polymer concentration in the dense region of gel v g2 decreases while that in the dilute region v s2 slightly increases as the charge density of the network i is increased . At high charge densities , v g2 approaches to v s2 , i . e . the gel becomes Fig . 12 . ( A ) Variations of the polymer concentrations in the dense ( solid curves ) and dilute regions of a gel ( dotted curves ) with the network charge density i : ( B ) Variation of the square ﬂuctuations in the refractive index h 2 with the network charge density i : Calculations were for x 0 ¼ 0 : 01 ; h 20 ¼ 7 £ 10 2 6 and for various crosslink densities v ge of the dense regions . v ge ¼ 80 ( 1 ) , 100 ( 2 ) , 120 ( 3 ) , and 140 mol m 2 3 ( 4 ) .

Calculations were for x 0 ¼ 0 : 01 and v ge ¼ 100 mol m 2 3 : h 20 ¼ 1 : 35 £ 10 2 7 ( 1 ) , 1 . 65 £ 10 2 6 ( 2 ) , 2 . 8 £ 10 2 6 ( 3 ) , 6 . 1 £ 10 2 6 ( 4 ) . For comparison , experimental k h 2 l vs aging time data of PAAm gels are also shown in the Figure as symbols . BAAm mol % : 0 . 54 ( X ) , 1 . 14 ( W ) , 1 . 46 ( O ) , 1 . 86 ( K ) , and 1 . 94 ( L ) . M . Y . Kizilay , O . Okay / Polymer 44 ( 2003 ) 5239 – 5250 5248 homogeneous , as seen in Fig . 12B . At a given degree of hydrolysis i ; the extent of gel inhomogeneity h 2 decreases with increasing v ge because of the increased crosslink density of both the dense and the dilute regions . In Fig . 13A , v g2 and v s2 vs i plots are shown for v ge ¼ 100 mol m 2 3 and for various values of h 20 : h 20 values used in the calculations were taken as the mean - square ﬂuctuations k h 2 l of PAAm gels after their preparation ( Fig . 10A ) . As h 20 of gels increases , v g2 decreases more rapid , i . e . homogenization becomes faster . This is in accord with the results given in Section 3 . 3 . In Fig . 13B , the ﬂuctuations in the refractive index h 2 are shown as the solid curves plotted as a function of i : For comparison , the experimental k h 2 l vs aging time data are also shown as symbols . In this Figure , the independent parameter i of the model was adjusted to ﬁt the experimental data , which is equivalent to ﬁtting the Y - intercept in Fig . 10A . It is seen that the model predictions well reproduce our experimental observations . It must be noted that several assumptions and restrictions were introduced during the development of the model . The network chains in the dense regions of gel may show deviations from the Gaussian behavior , especially at high crosslinker contents . Moreover , the local degree of swelling of a dense region will also depend on the properties of neighboring regions because it is encapsulated in a matrix environment . Therefore , the actual swelling degree of a dense region will be less than predicted by the model . However , the idealized model presented is though to form the basis for treating these deviations . 4 . Conclusions The spatial inhomogeneity in PAAm gels has been investigated with the static light scattering measurements . The gels were prepared at a ﬁxed initial monomer concentration but at various crosslink densities . The use of TEMED as the accelerator during the gel formation process enabled us to create charged groups in the aged gels . Elasticity measurements show that 91 – 94 % of the cross - linker molecules used in the hydrogel preparation were wasted in ineffective crosslinks . Debye – Bueche analysis of the light scattering data indicates that the frozen concen - tration ﬂuctuations within PAAm gel samples increase continuously with increasing crosslink density . This phenomenon was explained with the multiple crosslinking reactions leading to the formation of highly crosslinked regions in the ﬁnal hydrogel . It was found that the extent of gel inhomogeneity decreases drastically with increasing aging time , indicating that the hydrolysis of amide groups into acrylate groups facilitates the homogenization of the gels . A thermodynamic model was developed , which takes into account the inhomogeneous distribution of the mobile counterions throughout the gel volume . It was shown that the model predictions well reproduce the experimental observations . Acknowledgements Work was supported by the State Planning Organization ( DPT ) .
