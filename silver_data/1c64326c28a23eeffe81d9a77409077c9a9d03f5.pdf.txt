Maxfield * Department of Pathology , Columbia University , College of Physicians and Surgeons , New York , New York 10032 Submitted January 12 , 1995 ; Accepted May 2 , 1995 Monitoring Editor : Guido Guidotti A diverse set of cell surface eukaryotic proteins including receptors , enzymes , and adhesion molecules have a glycosylphosphoinositol - lipid ( GPI ) modification at the car - boxy - terminal end that serves as their sole means of membrane anchoring . These GPI - anchored proteins are poorly solubilized in nonionic detergent such as Triton X - 100 . In addition these detergent - insoluble complexes from plasma membranes are significantly enriched in several cytoplasmic proteins including nonreceptor - type tyrosine kinases and caveolin / VIP - 21 , a component of the striated coat of caveolae . These observations have suggested that the detergent - insoluble complexes represent purified caveolar membrane preparations . However , we have recently shown by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy that GPI - anchored proteins are diffusely distributed at the cell surface but may be enriched in caveolae only after cross - linking . Although caveolae occupy only a small fraction of the cell surface ( < 4 % ) , almost all of the GPI - anchored protein at the cell surface becomes incorporated into detergent - insoluble low - density complexes . In this paper we show that upon detergent treatment the GPI - anchored proteins are redistributed into a significantly more clustered distribution in the remaining mem - branous structures . These results show that GPI - anchored proteins are intrinsically detergent - insoluble in the milieu of the plasma membrane , and their co - purification with caveolin is not reflective of their native distribution . These results also indicate that the association of caveolae , GPI - anchored proteins , and signalling proteins must be critically re - examined . INTRODUCTION A diverse set of cell surface eukaryotic proteins in - cluding several receptors , enzymes , and adhesion molecules have a glycolipid modification at the car - boxy - terminal end . This is a post - translational modi - fication that serves as a membrane anchor and in - volves the replacement of the carboxy - terminal peptide sequence of the protein by a glycosyl - inositol phospholipid ( GPI ) 1 moiety ( Ferguson and Williams , * Corresponding author : Department of Pathology , Rm . 15 - 420 , College of Physicians and Surgeons , Columbia University , 630 West 168th St . , New York , NY 10032 . l Abbreviations used : CHO , Chinese hamster ovary ; DAF , decay - accelerating factor ; FBS , fetal bovine serum ; GPI , glycosylphospho - inositol - lipid ; HEPES , N - 2 - hydroxyethylpiperazine - N ' - 2 - ethane sulfonic acid ; HF , HEPES - buffered Hams F - 12 medium ; HRF - , HEPES - buffered folate - deficient RPMI ; mAb , mouse monoclonal 1988 ; Low , 1989 ; Cross , 1990 ; Field and Menon , 1992 ; Englund , 1993 ) . The structure and biosynthesis of the GPI moiety are now well understood , and it appears that all GPI - anchors have a common core glycan that bridges an ethanolamine residue in amide linkage with the protein and an inositol phospholipid ( Mayor and Menon , 1990 ; Field and Menon , 1992 ; Englund , 1993 ; McConville and Ferguson , 1993 ) . The main dif - ferences between GPI - anchors are due to numerous types of side chain modifications decorating the core glycan structure and the presence of various lipid backbones including glycerolipid and ceramide - based structures attached to a variety of mainly saturated antibodies ; PI - PLC , phosphatidylinositol - specific phospholipase C ; PLF , Pteroyl - lysyl - folate ; TRVb - 1 , CHO cells expressing human transferrin receptor .

In spite of the extensive biochemical information on the GPI - moiety of GPI - anchored proteins , the func - tions of this ubiquitous protein modification are less understood , although it has been implicated in a va - riety of cell biological processes ( Ferguson , 1994 ) . The GPI - anchor has been proposed to act as an apical targeting signal for proteins in some epithelial cell types via its association with putative glycolipid rafts in the trans - Golgi network ( Lisanti and Rodriguez - Boulan , 1990 ; Simons and Wandinger - Ness , 1990 ) . GPI anchoring has also been shown to be important for the intracellular signalling capacity of several proteins es - pecially in lymphocytes . In most cases the cross - link - ing of the protein is a prerequisite for their signalling function ( Robinson , 1991 ; Brown , 1993 ) . In immunolocalization studies , GPI - anchored pro - teins have been found to be clustered at the cell sur - face , and a significant fraction of the clusters are lo - calized to 50 - to 60 - nm caveolin / VIP - 21 - coated membrane invaginations called caveolae ( Rothberg et al . , 1992 ; Dupree et al . , 1993 ) . GPI - anchored proteins , a subset of membrane lipids ( sphingomyelin , acidic and neutral glycolipids , and cholesterol ) , and caveolin / VIP - 21 have been shown to be largely insoluble in nonionic detergents ( mainly cold Triton X - 100 ) ( Hooper and Turner , 1988 ; Glenney and Zokas , 1989 ; Brown , 1992 ; Brown and Rose , 1992 ) . Together these properties have been used by many investigators to purify caveolae or " caveolin / VIP - 21 - rich mem - branes " ( reviewed in Brown , 1992 ; Lisanti et al . , 1993 ) . Many cytoplasmically oriented signalling molecules , including heterotrimeric GTP - ases , small GTP - ases , and nonreceptor type protein - tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) have been localized to caveolae , primarily in aggre - gates derived with Triton X - 100 ( reviewed in Brown , 1993 ) . Based on this co - purification , GPI - anchored proteins have been proposed to mediate intracellular signalling in caveolae due to their association with PTKs in these structures ( Anderson , 1993 ; Brown , 1993 ; Lisanti et al . , 1993 ) . However , we have recently shown , using fluores - cently labeled monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) to dif - ferent GPI - anchored proteins , that these proteins are not constitutively concentrated in caveolae ; they are enriched in these structures only after cross - linking with polyclonal secondary antibodies ( Mayor et al . , 1994 ) . Analyses of the cell - surface distribution of GPI - anchored folate receptor and alkaline phosphatase by electron microscopy have also confirmed that these proteins are not constitutively enriched in caveolae ( Mayor et al . , 1994 ; Parton et al . , 1994 ) . Thus , multim - erization of GPI - anchored proteins regulates their se - questration in caveolae , but in the absence of agents that promote clustering they are diffusely distributed over the plasma membrane ( Mayor et al . , 1994 ) . The finding that GPI - anchored proteins are not nor - mally clustered over caveolae raised questions about how these proteins become enriched in the caveolae preparations obtained from detergent - extracted cells . In this paper , we analyze the effect of Triton X - 100 on the surface distribution of GPI - anchored proteins . We confirm that Triton X - 100 treatment leads to an almost complete insolubility of GPI - anchored proteins at the plasma membrane whereas transmembrane proteins are effectively solubilized , and we show that the de - tergent causes a redistribution of GPI - anchored pro - teins at the cell surface . In view of these findings we critically discuss the connection between Triton X - 100 insolubility , caveolae , and GPI - anchored proteins . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Mouse mAb to the human folate receptor ( MOvl9 ; Coney et al . , 1991 ) were a gift from Dr . Richard Anderson and Centocor ( Malvern , PA ) . Rabbit polyclonal antibody to caveolin / VIP - 21 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories ( Lexington , KY ) . Species - specific polyclonal IgGs to primary antibodies were obtained from Pierce Chemical ( Rockford , IL ) . Mouse mAb to decay - accelerating factor ( DAF ) , lA10 , ( Davitz et al . , 1986 ) was a gift from M . Davitz ( New York University , New York , NY ) . Labeling of mAbs and transferrin with the fluorophore Cy3 ( Biological Detection Systems , Pittsburgh , PA ) was carried out according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Pteroyl - lysyl - folate ( PLF ) ( McAlinden et al . , 1991 ) was obtained from Dr . J . Hynes ( Medical University of South Carolina ) . Gold ( 10 nm ) - conjugated antibodies were obtained from Amersham Life Science ( Buckinghamshire , England ) . Poly - D - lysine - treated cover - slip bottom dishes were made and used for growing cells for all microscopy studies as previously described ( Mayor et al . , 1993 ) . All chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical ( St . Louis , MO ) and tissue culture supplies were obtained from Life Technologies ( Gaithersburg , MD ) unless otherwise specified . Cells and Cell Culture G3G2 cells ( 3T3 - L1 cells transfected with cDNA of the human folate receptor ; Lacey et al . , 1989 ) were grown on cover slip dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10 % calf serum and 500 , ug / ml Geneti - cin ( DMEM - CS ) . All CHO cells lines were maintained in Hams F - 12 medium supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 100 U / ml penicillin , and 100 , ug / ml streptomycin . DAF - expressing CHO cells were obtained by the co - transfection of TRVb - 1 cells ( CHO cells expressing the human transferrin receptor ; McGraw et al . , 1987 ) with a hygromycin - resistant plasmid pHEBO ( Sugden et al . , 1985 ) and pCDM8 - derived plasmid consisting of the DAF cDNA ( Caras et al . , 1987 ; Medof et al . , 1987 ) . Folate receptor - expressing CHO cells were derived from TRVb - 1 cells by transfection with pMFRa , a plasmid constructed from the eukaryotic expression vector pMEP4 ( Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) and the full length cDNA of the human folate receptor identical to that found in KB cells ( Wang et al . , 1992 ) , and provided by Dr . M . Ratnam ( Medical University of Ohio , To - ledo , OH ) . The folate receptor cDNA was placed in front of the metallothionein promoter in the multiple cloning site in the eukary - otic expression vector pMEP4 . MA104 cells , a monkey kidney epi - thelial cell line , were maintained in folate - deficient DMEM - FBS and plated on coverslip dishes 5 days before the experiment . Labeling of Cells and Triton X - 100 Extractions To label with antibodies recognizing cell - surface GPI - anchored pro - teins , the cells were pre - incubated in F - 12 medium supplemented Molecular Biology of the Cell 930 Triton X - 100 Insolubility and GPI - anchored Proteins with 0 . 2 % bovine serum albumin , 1 . 2 g / l glucose , and 4 . 5 g / l HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ( HF - BSA ) for 10 min at 37Â°C . The cells were then incubated for 1 h at 0Â°C with Cy3 - labeled mAb ( 20 , ug / ml in the case of the anti - DAF monoclonal Cy3 - 1A10 , and 4 jig / ml in the case of the anti - folate receptor monoclonal Cy3 - MOvl9 ) . The cells were then rinsed ( twice for 2 min ) in medium 1 ( 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 mM CaCl2 , 1 mM MgCl2 , 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ) and then further incubated in medium 1 or with 1 % Triton X - 100 in medium 1 containing 2 , ug / ml aprotinin and 0 . 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 0Â°C for 30 min . The cells were rinsed in ice - cold medium 1 and taken for fluorescence imaging , or fixed with 3 % paraform - aldehyde and 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences , Fort Washington , PA ) for 10 min at 0Â°C followed by 30 min at room temperature and subsequently processed for electron microscopy . Control incubation was performed with an irrelevant mouse mAb MOPC - 21 ( Sigma Chemical ) at 20 jig / ml for the electron micro - scopic analyses , or Cy3 - conjugated mAb to an irrelevant Ag ( Thy 1 . 1 for CHO cells and DAF for 3T3 - L1 cells ) for fluorescence micros - copy . No detectable fluorescence was observed in the control incu - bations with any of the irrelevant mAbs on the appropriate cells . Before labeling with the fluorescent analogue of folic acid , PLF , ( McAlinden et al . , 1991 ) , the cells were first rinsed on ice with a low pH buffer ( twice for 30 s with acid - saline [ 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM CaCl2 , 1 mM MgCl2 , pH 3 . 0 , adjusted with acetic acid ] or twice for 2 min with a membrane - impermeant acid wash [ 50 mM sodium citrate , 280 mM sucrose , pH 4 . 6 ] ; similar results were obtained with either condition ) and then with medium 1 ( twice for 2 min ) and further incubated in HEPES - buffered folate - free RPMI 1640 , pH 7 . 4 ( HRF - ; Speciality Media , Lavallette , NJ ) , before the addition of PLF ( 15 nM ) in HRF - . PLF labeling of cells and detergent extraction was done in a manner similar to the labeling with antibodies described above except that HRF - was used instead of HF - BSA as the labeling medium . The fluorescence due to labeling of human folate receptor - transfected CHO cells with PLF was completely abolished in the presence of 1 . 0 , uM folic acid , and the staining of the DAF - trans - fected CHO cells with the fluorescent analogue was undetectable , confirming that the PLF was binding to the human - folate receptor , and that the folate receptor - transfected CHO cells expressed a bona fide high affinity folate receptor . To show that the fluorescence labeling was specific for GPI - anchored forms of the proteins in question , phosphatidylinositol - specific phospholipase ( PI - PLC ; from Bacillus thuringiensis , a gift from Dr . Martin Low ) digestion ( 10 U / ml , 2 h at 23Â°C or 0Â°C ) was performed on cells stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies ( 1 h at 23Â°C or 0Â°C , respectively ) . Both at room temperature and on ice , PI - PLC released all the detectable fluorescence from the cells , con - firming that the fluorescence was due to staining of GPI - anchored proteins in each case . The pattem of staining of caveolin / VIP - 21 in folate receptor - expressing cells was detected with a polyclonal antibody to caveo - lin / VIP - 21 . Cells were treated with or without Triton X - 100 as described above and fixed with 3 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 0Â°C followed by 20 min at room temperature . The fixed prepara - tions were rinsed in medium 1 and the cells that had not been treated with Triton X - 100 were permeabilized with medium 1 con - taining 100 iLg / ml saponin for 10 min at room temperature . All the samples were incubated with medium 1 containing 25 mM NH4 Cl and then with medium 1 containing 10 mg / ml bovine serum albu - min ( RIA grade ) . The cells were then incubated with affinity - puri - fied rabbit antibody to caveolin / VIP - 21 antibody ( 5 , ug / ml ) or with an irrelevant affinity - purified rabbit immunoglobin ( rabbit antibody to mouse immunoglobin ) at the same concentration . The cells were rinsed , and the primary antibody was visualized with rhodamine - conjugated secondary antibodies . The distribution of the GPI - an - chored folate receptor on the same cells was detected with the fluorescent analogue of folate , PLF , added at the same time as the secondary antibody incubation . All the incubations with antibodies were carried out in medium 1 containing 10 mg / ml bovine serum albumin for 45 min at room temperature . Fluorescence Microscopy Fluorescence microscopy and digital image collection were per - formed using a Leitz Diavert fluorescence microscope equipped with a Photometrics ( Tuscon , Arizona ) - cooled CCD camera and driven by software from Inovison ( Durham , NC ) on a SPARC station 4 / 330 computer system ( Sun Microsystems , Mountainview , CA ) as described previously ( Mayor et al . , 1993 ) . For output pur - poses the digital images were transferred to a Macintosh Power PC and printed via Adobe Photoshop software on a dye - sublimation printer ( Phaser Ilsdx , Tektronix , Wilsonville , Oregon ) . Quantitation of fluorescence was made using the Inovison image analysis software package . Total fluorescence per field was obtained by summing the pixel intensity over the whole field after subtract - ing an integer corresponding to a background value obtained from a field that did not contain any cells . Background fluorescence values including autofluorescence and nonspecific fluorescence were obtained by imaging fields of cells under the same illumina - tion and exposure conditions . Fluorescence quantitation was carried out with a 10 or 25X magnification objective to obtain a large number ( 30 - 100 ) of cells per field , whereas the images for visual - ization purposes were obtained at a higher magnification ( 63x , NA 1 . 4 objective ) . Electron Microscopy The mAb - labeled and fixed preparations were incubated in medium 1 containing 25 mM NH4C1 for 20 min , and then blocked in medium 1 containing 10 % FBS . All incubations on fixed cells were carried out at room temperature . The blocked preparations were then sequen - tially incubated in polyclonal rabbit anti - mouse antiserum ( 20 gg / ml specific Ig concentration ; ICN Biomedicals , Costa Mesa , CA ) followed by 1 / 30 dilution of 10 nm gold - conjugated goat anti - rabbit antibodies ( RPN 421 ; Amersham Life Science ) . The cells were rinsed in medium 1 containing 10 % FBS ( 3 x 5 min ) between incubations , then in medium 1 without FBS ( 3 x 1 min ) , and finally in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate , pH 7 . 4 . The cells were post - fixed in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate , containing 1 % glutaraldehyde , 1 % tannic acid ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) and 3 . 4 mM CaCl2 , at pH 7 . 4 , for 30 min , and rinsed in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate ( 3 x 1 min ) . The cells were then osmicated ( 1 % OS04 , 1 . 5 % KFe ( CN6 ) in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate , then rinsed ( 3 x 5 min ) in cacodylate buffer and finally water . The preparations were then dehydrated in graded ethanol washes and embedded in epon ( EM - bed 812 ; Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . The glass cover - slip along with the epon - embedded monolayer was removed from each cover - slip bottom dish and baked in an oven ( 24 h , 60Â°C ) . The glass was dissolved in aqueous HF ( 50 % ) , and the epon - embedded monolayers were dried in an oven at 60Â°C and cut lengthwise into thin 5 - mm wide strips . Three or four of these strips were re - embedded in blocks such that the flat surface of the strips was arranged parallel to the bottom of the block base . Sections ( 50 - to 60 - nm thick ) were cut from the these blocks on a RMC MT - 7000 ultramicrotome perpendicular to the plane of the cell monolayer . The sections were stained in 4 % uranyl acetate for 15 min followed by 0 . 4 % lead citrate for 4 min before observation on a JEOL JEM - 1200 EXII electron microscope at 80 KV . All images for the statistical data were taken at a magnification of 20 , OOOX and collected at random . Biochemical Analyses of Detergent Insolubility of GPI - anchored Folate Receptor The extent of GPI - anchored folate receptor insolubility was also analyzed by biochemical procedures . Folate receptor - expressing CHO cells were grown in 60 - mm dishes and labeled with PLF ( 5 nM ) for 30 min at 0Â°C . To determine the extent of solubility of the folate receptor in 1 % Triton X - 100 , the cells were extracted with 1 ml of cold 1 % Triton X - 100 as described above . The Triton extract representing the detergent soluble fraction was removed and kept for fluorescence analyses . Ice - cold 1 % Triton X - 100 solution ( 0 . 5 ml ) Vol . 6 , July 1995 931 S . Mayor and F . R . Maxfield was added to the plates and the cells were scraped using a rubber policeman . The plates were rinsed and scraped with an additional 0 . 5 ml of Triton X - 100 solution and the scrapings were pooled and taken for fluorescence analyses . To determine total surface receptors on the cells , plates were scraped directly into 1 ml ( 2 x 0 . 5 ml ) of the 1 % Triton X - 100 solution . Folate receptor was quantitated in each of the above fractions by measuring the specific fluorescence ( As " = 490 ; Aem = 530 ) of each of the fractions using an SLM 8000 spec - trofluorometer ( SLM Instruments , Rochester , NY ) . Nonspecific flu - orescence was determined by either leaving out the fluorescent analogue or including 200 nM folic acid in the labeling reaction ; similar values for nonspecific fluorescence were obtained in either case . To estimate the extent of association of the detergent - insoluble GPI - anchored folate receptor with the " low - density vesicles " ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ; Fiedler et al . , 1993 ; Fra et al . , 1994 ; Lisanti et al . , 1994b ) , PLF - labeled cells ( 60 - mm dishes ) were first extracted , scraped , and homogenized in 2 ml ( 2 x 1 ml ) of 1 % Triton X - 100 in a Tris - saline buffer ( 0 . 15 M NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 3 ) containing protease inhibitors ( 2 , ug / ml aprotinin , 0 . 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and 10 , ug / ml pepstatin A ) . The homogenate ( 1 . 75 ml ) was mixed with an equal volume of 2 . 7 M sucrose solution in the Tris - saline buffer and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube . 5 . 5 ml of 30 % sucrose followed by 2 . 5 ml of 5 % sucrose were then layered on top of the homogenate and cen - trifuged at 38 , 000 rpm in a SW4OTi rotor for 18 h at 4 ' C in a Beckman L7 - 55 ultracentrifuge ( Beckman Instruments , Palo Alto , CA ) . The step gradient was fractionated by collecting 1 - ml fractions from the top , and the fluorescence in each fraction was quantitated as described above . Nonspecific fluorescence was determined for each fraction of the gradient by measuring the fluorescence of unlabeled cells or cells labeled in the presence of 100 - fold excess folic acid . The nonspecific values in either case were indistinguish - able from each other , and were substracted from the values ob - tained from the corresponding fractions containing the PLF - labeled cells . RESULTS GPI - anchored proteins have been shown to be resis - tant to Triton X - 100 detergent extraction from cell membranes ( Hooper and Turner , 1988 ; Brown , 1992 ; Brown and Rose , 1992 ) . To determine the distribution of the proteins in the insoluble membrane fraction after the detergent extraction procedure , we labeled DAF - transfected CHO cells with Cy3 - conjugated mAb to DAF ( Cy3 - 1A10 ) ( Figure 1 , A and C - E ) or labeled folate receptor - transfected 3T3 cells with Cy3 - conju - gated mAb to the folate receptor ( Cy3 - MOvl9 ) ( Figure 1 , B , F , and G ) . The cells were then treated with Triton X - 100 at 0Â°C for 30 min ( Figure 1 , C - G ) or incubated in buffer without Triton X - 100 ( Figure 1 , A and B ) . In both the cell lines , the detergent extraction appears to create " holes " in the membrane , and an extremely granular appearance at the cell surface was rarely observed ( Figure 1 , E and G ) . In all cases the surface fluorescence was similar in brightness to the untreated controls , suggesting that a large fraction of the cell - surface GPI - anchored protein is insoluble in Triton X - 100 . This cell surface redistribution was also observed when folate receptor - transfected CHO cells were ex - amined with a fluorescein - labeled analogue of folic acid ( PLF ; McAlinden et al . , 1991 ) ; the uniformly dif - fuse surface fluorescence was transformed into a more mottled appearance after detergent extraction ( Figure 2 , A and C ) . This shows that the detergent - resistant property of the GPI - anchored proteins depicted in Figure 1 is not due to an artefactual situation induced by the binding of mAb to these proteins . To confirm that the detergent extraction procedure used in these studies ( and the microscopic observation of the insol - uble structures ) was qualitatively similar to the pro - cedures used by other investigators ( Hooper and Turner , 1988 ; Brown and Rose , 1992 ; Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ) , we examined the detergent extractability of a transmembrane protein , the human transferrin recep - tor , which is also expressed in these cells ( McGraw et al . , 1987 ) . In the absence of detergent , the transferrin staining is present in mostly a clustered distribution ( Figure 2B ) due to the receptor being significantly enriched in coated pits at the cell surface at steady state ( Jing et al . , 1990 ; McGraw and Maxfield , 1990 ) . However , after detergent treatment all the detectable fluorescence due to Cy3 - labeled transferrin binding to the transferrin receptor was extracted from the same cells in which the GPI - anchored folate receptor was almost totally insoluble ( Figure 2 , C and D ) . To provide a comparable situation to the diffusely distributed GPI - anchored proteins , we examined the detergent extractability of a mutant transferrin recep - tor expressed in CHO cells lacking endogenous trans - ferrin receptor ( McGraw et al . , 1987 ) . This receptor lacks the coated pit localization signal because it has the amino acids 3 through 59 deleted , but is still an - chored in the membrane by a peptide transmembrane anchor and four cytoplasmic amino acids , and is able to bind transferrin with the same affinity as the wild - type receptor ( Johnson et al . , 1993 ) . This receptor ( LW3 - 59 ) is not concentrated in coated pits and is conse - quently endocytosed at bulk endocytic rates , similar to many GPI - anchored proteins ( Widnell et al . , 1982 ; Keller et al . , 1991 ; Johnson et al . , 1993 ) . Figure 3A shows that the A3 - 59 receptor has a diffuse distribu - tion at the cell surface in live cells , and after detergent extraction there is no detectable transferrin fluores - cence remaining in extracted membranous structures ( Figure 3C ) . The results presented in Figures 1 - 3 are consistent with the previous observations of several investigators that GPI - anchored proteins are specifi - cally retained in detergent - insoluble membranes whereas most other transmembrane proteins are ex - tensively solubilized ( Hooper and Turner , 1988 ; Hooper and Bashir , 1991 ; Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ) . To determine the distribution of caveolae as charac - terized by caveolin / VIP - 21 staining in folate receptor - expressing CHO cells before and after detergent treat - ment , these cells were stained with a polyclonal antibody to caveolin / VIP - 21 . Caveolin / VIP - 21 stain - ing in CHO cells was punctated without or with de - Molecular Biology of the Cell 932 Triton X - 100 Insolubility and GPI - anchored Proteins Figure 1 .

Folate receptor - expressing CHO cells were labeled with a fluorescent folate analogue , PLF ( 5 nM ) , ( A and C ) and Cy3 - labeled transferrin ( 10 tLg / ml ) ( B and D ) for 30 min at 0Â°C , and after rinsing excess label the cells were either incubated in medium 1 at 0Â°C for 30 min in the absence of ( A and B ) or presence of 1 % Triton X - 100 ( C and D ) .

Similar to the data shown in Figure 2 , the folate receptors at the cell surface in the same cells were not enriched in any punctate structure or distri - bution . Specifically , regions containing caveolin / VIP - 21 were not detectably enriched in folate recep - tors . Quantitative analyses of the extent of insolubility of the folate receptor at the cell surface by two means showed that almost all of the surface PLF fluorescence was resistant to Triton X - 100 extrac - tion . As shown in Figure 5A , the fluorescence inten - sity directly measured by digital image analysis was not significantly reduced by Triton X - 100 treatment . Furthermore , essentially all of the PLF - binding ac - tivity was in the detergent - insoluble pellet when cells were extracted with Triton X - 100 before being scraped ( Figure 5B ) . This is similar to previous anal - yses in which the data show that greater than 80 % of the GPI - anchored proteins are resistant to Triton X - 100 extraction ( Hooper and Turner , 1988 ; Sargia - como et al . , 1993 ) . Furthermore , as shown in Figure 5C , most ( > 70 % ) of the detergent - insoluble GPI - anchored proteins fractionated at the 5 % / 30 % su - crose interface similar to the low - density complexes characterized by several investigators ( Brown and Rose , 1992 ; Fiedler et al . , 1993 ; Fra et al . , 1994 ; Lisanti et al . , 1994b ) .

CHO cells expressing a mutant human transferrin receptor that lacks the coated pit localization domain , A3 - 59 , ( Johnson et al . , 1993 ) were incubated with Cy3 - transferrin ( 10 , tg / ml ) and treated without ( A and B ) or with ( C and D ) Triton X - 100 as described in Figure 2 . Fluorescence ( A and C ) and phase images ( B and D ) were collected from the same cells . Bar , 10 , um . Electron microscopic analyses of the surface distri - bution of the folate receptor on MA104 cells and DAF on CHO cells before and after Triton X - 100 treatment are shown in Figure 6 . The mAb - labeled GPI - anchored proteins were fixed under conditions that do not per - mit a redistribution of the GPI - anchored proteins dur - ing the immuno - gold ( 10 nm ) labeling procedure ( Mayor et al . , 1994 ) . In the untreated condition , the GPI - anchored proteins appear to be randomly distrib - uted at the cell surface , mainly in singlets . However , after the detergent treatment , there is an increased clustering of the GPI - anchored protein at the cell sur - face ( compare images in Figure 6 , A and C with Figure 6 , B and D ) . To provide a quantitative estimate of the extent of clustering induced by Triton X - 100 treat - ment , a large number of EM micrographs were ran - domly selected and examined , and a distribution of cluster sizes of gold particles was determined for each condition ( Figure 7 and Table 1 ) . Quantitative analyses of the distribution of DAF on CHO cells show that similar to our previous data describing folate receptors on MA104 cells ( Mayor et al . , 1994 ) , GPI - anchored DAF is randomly distributed at the cell surface ; there is neither an enrichment nor depletion in either caveolae or clathrin - coated pits ( Table 1 ) . In the presence of Triton X - 100 it is not possible to morphologically distinguish caveolae or clathrin - coated pits in the remaining membranous structure . However , there is a moderate increase in the surface density of gold particles of the folate receptor from 2 . 14 particles / , um to 4 . 61 particles / , gm in MA104 cells and of DAF from 5 . 32 particles / , tm to 6 . 34 par - Vol . 6 , July 1995 935 S .

Bar , 10 jim . ticles / , um in DAF - transfected CHO cells ( Table 1 ) . This is probably due to the creation of the holes that are observed in the detergent - treated cell membranes ( Figures 1 , 2 , and 4 ) leading to a reduction in overall membrane surface area . Using a definition of clustering consistent with pre - vious analyses of the surface distribution of GPI - an - chored proteins ( greater than three gold particles ; Rothberg et al . , 1990 ; Mayor et al . , 1994 ) , the data show that after Triton X - 100 treatment there is a 2 . 6 - fold increase in clustering of DAF on CHO cells and an 8 . 6 - fold increase in clustering of the folate receptors on MA104 cells ( Table 1 ) . Although these increases are significant , a much larger fraction of the GPI - anchored proteins were clustered after antibody - mediated cross - linking ( - 92 % ; Mayor et al . , 1994 ) . These anti - body - induced clusters were also much larger in size ( Figure 8 ) , and after antibody cross - linking the GPI - anchored proteins were specifically enriched in caveo - lae but not in coated pits ( Mayor et al . , 1994 ) .

The figure shown is represen - Â° 10 tative of two separate experiments . ( B ) PLF - labeled folate receptor - i expressing CHO cells were treated with detergent and the total surface folate receptor on the cells ( Total ) , the amount of folate _ receptor in the detergent soluble ( S ) , and insoluble ( I ) fractions were 5 biochemically determined as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . The numbers presented are averages obtained from two 60 - mm dishes and the error bars correspond to the range of 0 values obtained . ( C ) The total homogenate from PLF - labeled folate 2 4 6 8 10 12 receptor - expressing CHO cells was layered on a step gradient and 1 - ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and Fraction # analyzed for folate receptor content as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . The 5 % / 30 % sucrose interface was collected in fraction 3 and the 30 % / 40 % interface was collected in fraction 9 . . 85 % of the total fluorescence present in the homogenate was recovered in all the fractions . The data shown are the averages obtained from two 60 - mm dishes and the error bars correspond to the range of values obtained . A431 cells ( Parton et al . , 1994 ) , confirmed that these proteins are neither enriched in caveolae nor excluded from coated pits . The data presented here demonstrate that the diffuse nature of GPI - anchored proteins at the cell surface is not an artefactual consequence of the binding of mAbs to these proteins : a fluorescent ana - logue of folate , PLF , bound to the GPI - anchored hu - man folate receptor at the cell surface also showed a diffuse distribution similar to that obtained with fluo - rescently labeled mAbs . The data also show that GPI - anchored proteins at the cell surface are almost completely insoluble in Triton X - 100 and become incorporated into low den - sity complexes . Under these conditions transmem - brane proteins such as the transferrin receptor and most other polypeptide - based membrane - anchored proteins are readily solubilized ( Hooper and Turner , 1988 ; Hooper and Bashir , 1991 ; Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ; this report ) . The data presented here are contrary to the wide - spread interpretation that the low density Triton X - 100 insoluble membranes represent a purified caveolae preparation ( or a caveolin / VIP - 21 - rich preparation : 50 - to 100 - fold enriched ) thereby accounting for the 100 - to 200 - fold enrichment of the GPI - anchored pro - teins contained in them ( Anderson , 1993 ; Lisanti et al . , Vol . 6 , July 1995 A 30 25 - $ - 20 cu t 15 0 - T T I Total S Treatment 937 S .

Bin size refers to the number of gold particles per cluster , and 0 % gold particles refers to the percentage of 1 2 3 gold particles found in a particular size cluster with respect to the total number at the cell surface . 1993 ; Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ; Chang et al . , 1994 ) . The almost complete insolubility of the GPI - anchored pro - teins along with their lack of enrichment in the rela - tively small punctate areas occupied by caveolae after detergent treatment shows that these proteins are de - tergent insoluble , independent of their association with caveolae . The lack of association with caveolin / VIP - 21 is consistent with recent studies in lympho - cytes in which GPI - anchored Thy - i and the ganglio - side GM1 were detergent insoluble and almost quantitatively formed low - density complexes even though the cells lack detectable caveolin / VIP - 21 or caveolae ( Fra et al . , 1994 ) . As suggested by Fra et al . ( 1994 ) this could be due to the formation of specific detergent - insoluble glycolipid domains . Alternatively , these proteins may be intrinsically detergent - insoluble in the milieu of the plasma membrane ( see below ) .

However , multiple GPI - anchored proteins on the same cell did not co - cluster or get recruited to caveolae unless they were independently cross - linked , indicating that the GPI - anchored proteins are not as - sociated with each other at the cell surface ( Mayor et al . , 1994 ) . Similar observations have been made in lymphocytes in which Thy - i and GM - 1 did not co - cluster after cross - linking with multivalent agents ( Fra et al . , 1994 ) . This is in contradiction with the detection and significant enrichment of multiple GPI - anchored proteins and glycolipids in the detergent - resistant complexes ( Lisanti et al . , 1993 ; Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 ; Fra et al . , 1994 ; Lisanti et al . , 1994b ; Chang et al . , 1994 ) , which has been interpreted to suggest that GPI - an - chored proteins are associated with each other ( or a common receptor ) in these complexes .

More than 50 negatives of randomly selected fields were analyzed for each condition in each experiment . a After labelling with primary monoclonal antibodies , the cells were treated in the presence ( + TX - 100 ) or absence of detergent ( - TX - 100 ) and processed for electron microscopy as described in Figure 6 and MATERIALS AND METHODS . b Nonspecific binding of gold particles to the cells was determined for the two conditions using an irrelevant IgG as the primary antibody . < 0 . 02 gold particles per , um were detected in all cases . c A cluster was defined to contain more than three gold particles separated by less than 50 nm from the nearest neighbor . d Gold particles ( or clusters ) less than 50 nm from the edge of caveolae or coated pits were considered to be associated with them . e Relative concentration is the ratio of the observed gold particle density in caveolae or coated pits to the average gold particle density over all membrane . The average membrane length associated with caveolae and coated pits was 0 . 15 , um and 0 . 25 , tm , respectively . lipids in Triton X - 100 can be reconstituted in the ab - sence of any special structures or protein ( s ) . The pri - mary requirement for detergent insolubility is the presence of a significant mole fraction of high - melting temperature lipids such as saturated acyl chain - con - taining phospholipids as well as an optimal concen - tration of cholesterol or neutral glycolipids . Further - more , detergent insolubility of GPI - anchored proteins requires the presence of the appropriate lipid milieu in the same bilayer as these proteins ( D . Brown , personal communication ; Schroeder et al . , 1994 ) . Thus , the in - solubility of GPI - anchored proteins in Triton X - 100 depends mainly on the acyl or alkyl chain composition of the membrane lipids , cholesterol or neutral glyco - lipid content , and probably the degree of saturation of the acyl or alkyl moiety of the GPI - anchor . Saturated alkyl / acyl chains appear to be the predominant com - ponents of the lipid portion of GPI - anchors ( McCon - ville and Ferguson , 1993 ) . Fluidity measurements of the detergent - resistant fraction from plasma membrane and from reconsti - tuted membrane preparations showed that the deter - gent - resistant membranes were considerably less fluid than the untreated membrane preparations ( Schroeder et al . , 1994 ) . As discussed by Brown and colleagues ( Brown , 1992 ; Schroeder et al . , 1994 ) , these results sug - gest the potential for membrane domains with more and less fluid regions in the untreated membrane . However , the a priori existence of membrane domains enriched in high - melting temperature lipids has only been shown in artificial membranes ( e . g . at relatively high mole fractions of neutral glycolipid in phospho - lipid bilayers ; reviewed in Thompson and Tillack , 1985 ) . In a separate study using a multivalent ligand , cholera toxin binding subunit - colloidal gold com - plexes , Parton ( 1994 ) has shown that the ganglioside GM1 is enriched in caveolae in freeze - substituted preparations of A431 cells and is further enriched upon warming up at 37Â°C in the presence of cholera toxin . The detergent extraction of membranes is a very complex process and the mechanisms of lipid redistri - bution and insolubility are poorly understood ( Hele - nius and Simons , 1975 ; Lichtenberg et al . , 1983 ) . The selective solubilization of various lipid classes in Tri - ton X - 100 have been documented extensively ( Yu et al . , 1973 ; Helenius and Simons , 1975 ; Streuli et al . , 1981 ; Brown and Rose , 1992 ; Fiedler et al . , 1993 ) . The data show that the insoluble residue consisting mainly of glycolipids , sphingolipids , cholesterol , and some glyc - erophospholipids could represent at least 50 % of the total plasma membrane surface area if the detergent - insoluble lipids are mainly derived from the plasma membrane as in the case of red blood cell ghosts ( Yu et Molecular Biology of the Cell 940 Triton X - 100 Insolubility and GPI - anchored Proteins 60 50 cA * _ 1 P - - u - 4 o 0 - 40 30 20 Figure 8 . Comparison of the clustering of GPI - anchored proteins at the cell surface after Triton X - 100 treatment and antibody - medi - ated cross - linking . Cluster size distribution of gold particles obtained after Triton X - 100 treatment ( hatched bars ) , secondary anti - body - mediated cross - linking ( solid bars ) ( as described in Mayor et al . , 1994 ) , or no treat - ment ( open bars ) of MOvl9 - labeled folate re - ceptors at the MA104 cell surface as described in Figure 6 . al . , 1973 ) . This fraction may be higher than 50 % con - sidering the asymmetrical distribution of the insoluble lipids in the membrane bilayer ( reviewed in Dawid - owicz , 1987 ; Devaux , 1991 ) . It is possible that deter - gent extraction of the plasma membrane bilayer could result in the coalescence of micro - domains , or even create these less fluid regions de novo by the differ - ential extraction of lipid classes found in natural mem - branes ( Yu et al . , 1973 ) . Our data show that before detergent extraction a very small fraction ( 3 - 9 % ) of the cell surface GPI - anchored proteins is present in clus - ters of more than three gold particles whereas after detergent extraction a much larger fraction of the total surface GPI - anchored proteins ( 22 - 26 % ) is clustered . These observations suggest that membrane domains enriched in GPI - anchored proteins do not exist before detergent extraction , or if they do , they contain a relatively low concentration of GPI - anchored proteins with respect to the rest of the lipid milieu . It is possible that the detergent extraction - induced redistribution serves to concentrate the GPI - anchored proteins in the plane of the membrane leading to an association with other detergent insoluble components ( Glenney and Zokas , 1989 ; Kurzchalia et al . , 1992 ) . However , there appears to be no detectable enrichment of the GPI - anchored proteins in the punctate caveolin - staining areas at the level of light microscopy in the detergent - insoluble membranes . Many cytoplasmically oriented proteins such as PTKs and heterotrimeric G proteins have been found in detergent insoluble complexes ( Stefanova 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 Bin Size et al . , 1991 ; Cinek and Horejsi , 1992 ; Bohuslav et al . , 1993 ; Lisanti et al . , 1993 , 1994b ; Chang et al . , 1994 ) . As pointed out by Lisanti and co - workers , these proteins share a common lipid modification motif , Met - Gly - Cys , which is the site for N - myristylation ( on the N - terminal Gly after cleavage of Met ) and palmitylation ( on the Cys ) at the N - terminus and may direct association with the detergent - insoluble complexes ( Lisanti et al . , 1994a ) . In confirmation of this hypothesis , the association of two PTKs , p56lck and p59fyn , with the detergent - insoluble complexes was found to be due to the N - terminal myristylation at the Gly residue and palmitylation at the Cys 3 residue ( Shenoy et al . , 1994 ) . Furthermore , another PTK , p6Osrc , is N - myristylated but is not palmity - lated ( because it has the sequence Met - Gly - Ser at the N - terminus ) and was found not to be associated with these detergent - insoluble complexes ( Shenoy et al . , 1994 ) . However , a mutant version of p6osrc that contains the Met - Gly - Cys motif at its N - terminus is N - myristylated at the Gly residue and palmitylated at Cys , and was found to be associated with the detergent - resistant complex . These data are consis - tent with the idea that association with the deter - gent - insoluble membranes requires closely juxta - posed saturated fatty acyl chains and the presence in the same bilayer of the various saturated acyl / alkyl chain - containing proteins and lipids ( Yu et al . , 1973 ; Schroeder et al . , 1994 ) . These cytoplasmic lipid - modified proteins share the property of detergent insolubility with GPI - anchored 10 0 Vol . 6 , July 1995 941 S . Mayor and F . R . Maxfield proteins and association with the low - density com - plexes . However , we have shown that in the case of the GPI - anchored proteins , this does not reflect an initial concentration in any specialized structures . Rather , it is a measure of their distribution into deter - gent - resistant structures after detergent treatment . It is possible that a similar redistribution occurs with these cytoplasmic proteins . These observations indicate that there is little evidence for the existence of complexes of GPI - anchored proteins and PTKs at the cell surface before detergent extraction . It is possible that complexes similar to those formed after detergent extraction may be formed in cells as a regulated event and require physiological triggers . Antibody - mediated cross - linking of GPI - anchored proteins , although not entirely physiological , is a means for activating signalling functions of GPI - an - chored proteins ( reviewed in Robinson , 1991 ; Brown , 1993 ; Ferguson , 1994 ) . The aggregated state of these lipid - linked proteins could generate a relatively stable membrane domain where signalling proteins such as N - terminal - myristylated and Cys - 3 - palmitylated PTKs could be recruited and consequently activated . It would be interesting to determine if such complexes may be formed in the membrane of caveolae because , after cross - linking , GPI - anchored proteins are rela - tively enriched in these structures in cells that have caveolae ( Mayor et al . , 1994 ; Parton et al . , 1994 ) . Fur - ther studies will be required to distinguish whether cross - linked GPI - anchored proteins could cause the formation of membrane domains that assemble signal - ling molecules or if GPI - anchored proteins and cyto - plasmic signalling molecules exist in complexes in micro - domains that are unresolvable at the resolution of current localization techniques . Most importantly , our data indicate that GPI - anchored proteins are re - distributed during detergent extraction to a more clus - tered distribution and suggest that any interpretation of the function of these proteins or their association with caveolae , and PTKs , based on detergent extrac - tion , should be viewed with caution .
