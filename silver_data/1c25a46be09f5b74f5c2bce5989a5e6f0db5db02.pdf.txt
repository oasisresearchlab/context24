Article How do Black adults experience , interpret , and respond to daily slights and exclusions , by White persons ( WPs ) , called microaggressions ? What health consequences do Black per - sons ( BPs ) attribute to microaggressions ? What if microag - gressions occur in cross - race health care interactions ? This article reports on an exploratory qualitative study on racial microaggression experiences . The narrative study involved semistructured interviews with 10 African American / Black adults , and categorical as well as narrative analysis . Is Racism Still a Problem ? Some believe that civil rights progress culminated when President Obama , an African American , was elected and that now society is post - racial ( Hesse , 2010 ; Roediger , 2008 ; Wise , 2010 ) . Overt and institutionalized forms of racism , such as hate speech and crimes , false arrests , disproportion - ate incarceration , beatings , and homicide continue ( Krivo , Peterson , & Kuhl , 2009 ) . White supremacist groups are resurgent . Yet such overt racism is generally perceived as less common . Structural and systematic racism persist , and it is hard to make organizational cultural changes in large insti - tutional systems ( Roediger , 2008 ) . Most recent opposition from the Black community has concerned police brutality and resultant homicides of young and especially relatively big Black males . At the hands of police , Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson , Missouri , and Eric Garner in New York ; grand jury dismissals of such cases spurred resistance con - sisting of nonviolent action nationwide . Most recently , Baltimore was the site of resistance and new organization for change , wherein charges were brought by the state’s attorney against six officers , for the homicide of yet another Black man . An analysis of these incidents is beyond the scope of this article . These public events and figures are scrutinized by people of color ( POC ) , who identify with those killed and their families . Suffice it to say , racism is still a problem in the United States . Economic and environmental disparities are widespread for POC . Urban - dwelling BPs pay more for utilities as com - pared with ( White ) suburban dwellers . De facto segregation occurs through “redlining , ” and BPs disproportionately face home foreclosure . Unemployment is highest among Black Americans , and thus fewer have employment - based health insurance ( Krivo et al . , 2009 ; West , 2001 ; Wise , 2008 , 2010 ) . 591569 GQN XXX10 . 1177 / 2333393615591569Global Qualitative Nursing Research Hall and Fields research - article 2015 1 University of Tennessee , Knoxville , Knoxville , Tennessee , USA 2 Roane State Community College , Harriman , Tennessee , USA Corresponding Author : Joanne M .

Hall 1 and Becky Fields 2 Abstract Perceived racism contributes to persistent health stress leading to health disparities . African American / Black persons ( BPs ) believe subtle , rather than overt , interpersonal racism is increasing . Sue and colleagues describe interpersonal racism as racial microaggressions : “routine” marginalizing indignities by White persons ( WPs ) toward BPs that contribute to health stress . In this narrative , exploratory study , Black adults ( n = 10 ) were asked about specific racial microaggressions ; they all experienced multiple types . Categorical and narrative analysis captured interpretations , strategies , and health stress attributions . Six iconic narratives contextualized health stress responses . Diverse mental and physical symptoms were attributed to racial microaggressions . Few strategies in response had positive outcomes . Future research includes development of coping strategies for BPs in these interactions , exploration of WPs awareness of their behaviors , and preventing racial microaggressions in health encounters that exacerbate health disparities .

Despite numerous calls for research and reform , structural racism and racial health disparities continue . This is a vital concern for BP and health care providers ( Hall & Fields , 2012 , 2013 ) . Racial Health Disparities What do we know about racial health disparities ? Race is a social construction , not a scientific reality ( Brewer , 2006 ; Fullwiley , 2008 ; Goodman , 2000 ; Gravlee , 2009 ) . Clinicians sometimes profile exclusively by assumed group genetic dif - ferences and miss individuals’ needs ( Hunt , Truesdell , & Kreiner , 2013 ) . Few racial health disparities are genetically based . Racial health disparities vary with lifestyles , diet , and economics but also occur with lack of access , undertreat - ment , no or incorrect referrals , and missed diagnoses . Some barriers occur because of biases on the part of White care providers . BPs mistrust of U . S . health care is justified by an atrocious history of “treatment” and experimentation span - ning centuries by medical “scientists” in the United States ( Washington , 2008 ) . Some health disparities are likely con - nected to interpersonally experienced racial microaggres - sions . Therefore , interpersonal subtle racism is likely contributing to racial health disparities , but how this occurs has not been explored . Racial Microaggressions Subtle interpersonal racism refers to daily racial hassles and slights engendered by WPs and directed at POC , here spe - cifically BPs . These experiences likely contribute to stress , increasing allostatic load for targeted persons ( Geronimus , Hicken , Keene , & Bound , 2006 ; Wise , 2008 ) . These ubiqui - tous slights , including patronizing behaviors , stereotyping , ignoring persons , and other insults , are called racial micro - aggressions ( Sue et al . , 2007 ) . Microaggressions comprise interpersonal , biased behaviors that can be described and tested for ( Nadal , 2011 ) . The objective is not only to elimi - nate them but also to help targeted people strategize to avoid associated stress ( Hall & Fields , 2012 , 2013 ) . Microaggressions occur between members of a culturally dominant group toward oppressed others , based on gender , ethnicity , color / race , sexual orientation , and so on ( Sue , 2010 ) . Concisely defined , Racial microaggressions are brief and commonplace daily verbal , behavioral , or environmental indignities , whether intentional or unintentional , that communicate hostile , derogatory , or negative racial slights and insults toward POC . Perpetrators of microaggressions are often unaware that they engage in such communications when they interact with racial / ethnic minorities . ( Sue et al . , 2007 , p . 271 ) Sue ( 2010 ) continues , Microaggressions have the lifelong insidious effect of silencing , invalidating and humiliating the identity and / or voices of those who are oppressed . Although their lethality is less obvious , they nevertheless grind down and wear out the victims . ( p . 66 ) They include microassaults ( name - calling , shunning , pur - poseful discrimination ) , microinsults ( implications of nega - tivity , diminishing the other , rudeness ) , and microinvalidations ( minimizing or ignoring target person’s feelings and state - ments , denying racism or oppression , denying White privi - lege , and so forth ; Sue , 2010 ; Sue et al . , 2007 ) . Microaggressions are detectable instances of subtle , inter - personal racism . Structural racism and interpersonal racism interconnect in the form of microaggressive cross - race social interactions , wherein ideologies emerge in everyday social interactions . The statement by a White employer to a Black applicant , for example , that the job has been filled , when it has not , is one interpersonal comment toward one BP . Yet as this occurs thousands of times , it results in higher unemploy - ment for BPs , a structural reality . Sue identifies the following major categories of racial microaggressions : ascriptions of intelligence ( “You are so articulate . ” ) , second - class citizen ( passed over or ignored ) , pathologizing cultural values / language ( designation as “abnormal , ” or implying White as the standard of compari - son ) , assumptions of criminality ( WPs clutching belongings , clerks or guards surveilling individuals in a store ) , belief that POC are foreign or alien , colorblindness ( WPs denying they “see” color / race ) , the myth of meritocracy ( Whites minimiz - ing White privilege and the role of race in attaining success ) , and denial of individual racism ( White denial of societal rac - ism and / or one’s role in maintaining it ; Sue , 2010 ) . Perceived Racism and Health A meta - analysis revealed that perceived racism is associated with psychological problems and moderates depression ( Pieterse , Todd , Neville , & Carter , 2012 ) . Perceived racism is related to HIV - risk sexual behaviors , especially exacer - bated with substance use ( Stock et al . , 2013 ) . Relatively few studies have confirmed the role of perceived racism on car - diovascular health ( Brondolo , Rieppi , Kelly , & Gerin , 2003 ) , though there is increasing evidence that the stress of racism as a social determinant of health fosters cardiovascular dis - ease ( CVD ) over time ( Jackson , McGibbon , & Waldron , 2013 ) . Structural factors such as employment , education , and judicial treatment not only increase BPs’ risk of myocardial infarction but also decrease WPs’ risk ( Lukachko , Hatzenbuehler , & Keyes , 2014 ) . Perceived racism regarding one’s neighborhood negatively affects physical activity lev - els in African American adults ( Edwards & Cunningham , 2013 ) , which has cardiovascular implications . Increasingly , literature documents health disparities as most pronounced and severe for African Americans ( Dailey , Hall and Fields 3 2008 ; Hall & Fields , 2012 ; Hardy , 2007 ; Tashiro , 2005 ; Underwood et al . , 2004 , 2005 ; Utsey , Ponteretto , Reynolds , & Cancelli , 2000 ; Williams & Williams - Morris , 2000 ) ; BPs have the lowest life expectancy ( men are lowest ) compared with all other POC , and highest rates of infant mortality ( Clark , 2006 ; Gravlee , 2009 ; Hardy , 2007 ; Smedley , Stith , & Nelson , 2002 ) . Infant mortality worsens in the 20s to 30s in Black women because they have already sustained signifi - cant stress . This is called “weathering” ( Geronimus et al . , 2006 ) . A systematic review ( Dolezsar , McGrath , Herzig , & Miller , 2014 ) demonstrated that perceived racism was asso - ciated especially with nighttime ambulatory hypertension in Black men . Disparities in mental and physical health risks range from cancer to CVD and diabetes , to depression and traumatic stress . Further exploration of behavioral coping , perceived racism , and health effects is needed . ( Mwendwa et al . , 2011 ) . This study partly addresses these concerns from the standpoint of African American / Black adults’ narratives of racial microaggressions . Study Background Our study reports microaggression experiences and their consequences , as expressed in narrative interviews with 10 Black American adults in the southeastern United States . We concurred that interpersonal racism might partially contrib - ute to health disparities by increasing allostatic load ( Geronimus et al . , 2006 ; Hall & Fields , 2012 ; Wise , 2008 ) . In the chronic and exhaustion phases of stress , there is a tipping point as disease emerges . Other sociopolitical / economic fac - tors further limit access , acceptability , and quality of care : discrimination , inability to afford medications , family obli - gations , and so on . In addition , microaggressions likely occur between White providers and Black patients , as has been seen in cross - racial counseling relationships ( Constantine , 2007 ; Sue , Rivera , Capodilupo , Lin , & Torino , 2010 ) . BPs often distrust providers and hold suspicions of second - class treatment , compounding the suffering of illness with lack of confidence in care . Thus , in this study , we elicited narratives of racial micro - aggressions and inquired as to immediate interpretations , coping strategies , results of these strategies , and health effects participants attributed to microaggressions . The dual concerns were the daily stresses of subtle interpersonal rac - ism and the possibility that microaggressions may interfere with quality of care and overall health . Method Theoretical Framework The study is grounded in critical race theory ( CRT ; Delgado & Stephancic , 2001 ) , which defines racial oppression more complexly than is framed by an Enlightenment “rights” per - spective . CRT emphasizes that focusing on “rights” does not necessarily engender community empowerment , activism , and critical analysis of history , economics , consciousness , and diversity . In CRT , scholarly activism and community organizing expose and transform oppressive racialization and power dynamics ( West , 2001 ) . CRT also emphasizes everyday bias experiences , and thus , personal narratives are central . Counternarratives are those that undermine domi - nant ideologies , giving voice to oppressive experiences , including slavery . Current personal narratives from Black men and women in the United States are instructive of inter - personal racism and should be critically heard . Terminology Many BPs have no preference between the terms African American and Black ; we use the term Black because ( a ) in the southeastern states , this is the most obvious context of racism ; ( b ) the history of slavery and Jim Crow affects BP in a distinct way from refugees and immigrant / immigrant - descended POC ; ( c ) there are many BPs who are descended from a diaspora , and despite different cultural / geographical roots , they similarly face Black – White discrimination . Racialization of skin color gradations within subgroups of POC sets up another shifting hierarchy . Yet it is context , how the dominant White group , that defines whether one is con - sidered “Black or White , ” perceives the individual and what privileges and rights that person can assume ( Painter , 2010 ) . Frequently , marginalized persons experience intersec - tionality of multiple stigmatizing characteristics , including race , gender ( lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , queer and intersex ) status , class , and illness ( Collins , von Unger , & Armbrister , 2008 ; Van Herk , Smith , & Andrew , 2011 ) . We found some gender differences , but a complete exploration of intersecting oppressions was beyond the study scope . Purpose and Specific Aims The purpose of this narrative study was to explore the experi - ences of racial microaggressions in a group of urban - dwell - ing Black men and women in the southeastern United States . We especially focused on recalled microaggression experi - ences , strategic responses , and attributed health effects . The specific aims of the study were to 1 . Describe individuals’ experiences of a variety of racial microaggressions , including perceptions , inter - pretations , and strategies used , and consequences of strategies taken . 2 . Assess for stress - related symptoms and illnesses attributed to experiences of microaggressions . 3 . Identify microaggressions experienced in health care - seeking and health encounters . 4 . Pilot several instruments related to symptoms and perceived stress for acceptability and applicability in future studies of subtle racism . 4 Global Qualitative Nursing Research This article reports on Aims 1 through 3 . The long - range goal of the study is the reduction of racial health disparities through isolating the role of subtle interpersonal racism in producing stress - related symptoms . Stressful interactions contribute directly as well as indirectly , for example , through preventing BPs from seeking or continuing treatment with White providers and White - dominated health systems . Based on CRT , the subjective is vital in revealing the con - text of marginalization . Narrative is a usual form of commu - nication , an expressive manner of providing social , political , and geographic context in daily life , and in disruptions of it ( E . M . Bruner , 1986 ; J . S . Bruner , 2001 ; Polkinghorne , 1988 ) . Narratives show temporality of events and contain narrative truths that may not conform to “what really hap - pened” ( Nairn , 2004 ; Paley & Eva , 2005 ; Reissman , 2008 ; Sandelowski , 1991 ; Seibold , Richards , & Simon , 1994 ; Wilkinson & Hough , 1996 ) . In this exploratory study , per - ceptions took precedence over historical ( indeterminable ) “facts . ” We emphasized key perceptions and considered contin - gencies , opportunities , and barriers faced in interactive situ - ations ( Reissman , 2008 ) . We noted the manner of telling as well as the story content . This process revealed motivations of the teller and of the interviewer’s openness to hear about physical and mental stress , White privilege , and resistance , and was accompanied by descriptions of a variety of emo - tional and behavioral responses to recalling microaggressive circumstances . Syntactic and semantic narrative analyses were done , but we focused on the semantic ( Daiute & Lightfoot , 2004 ; Emden , 1998 ; Lieblich , Tuval - Mashiach , & Zilber , 1998 ) . The study was cross - sectional and retrospective , involving the recalled microaggression experiences of Black adults , performed by WPs toward BPs , in diverse situations . We used the taxonomy of racial microaggressions established by Sue and colleagues ( Sue , 2010 ; Sue , Capodilupo , & Holder , 2008 ; Sue et al . , 2007 ) as a starting point for interviewing , and categories were further particularized based on in vivo - defined microaggressions . For example , in the broad catego - ries of seeing the individual as abnormal , or as foreign , we noted exoticism ( Said , 1979 ) as a particular instance of this category . Interviews Five of the interviews were conducted by a Black woman and five by a White woman ; both are nurse researchers and self - and socially identified as to their race . The researchers have extensive psychiatric and / or geropsychiatric experience and are skilled at eliciting narratives in the phrasing of questions and the language of temporality : “When did the situation start to unravel ? ” “Have you ever had a WP comment on your intel - ligence ? What happened ? How did it finally turn out ? ” and so forth . We probed especially for interpretations of microaggres - sions and outcomes to the incidents narrated . We explored the following : overidentification and overfamiliarity , exoticism , assumptions of criminality , surprise at achievement and intel - ligence , denial of racism , stereotyping , colorblindness , social invisibility , and expectations of conformity to White stan - dards , inferiorization , and infantilizing . Ethical Considerations The institutional review board of the University of Tennessee approved the study . Before each interview , the study and consent document were explained to the potential partici - pant , questions were answered , written informed consent was obtained , and participants were informed they could skip any questions and discontinue the study with no penal - ties or loss of any services . The sound and text data files were de - identified using identification numbers , and pseudonyms were assigned to text files . Research materials were kept in a locked file in a university office , and on password - protected drives and servers . Those having access to data ( transcrip - tionist and graduate students ) signed a confidentiality pledge . Data will be destroyed when all analyses are completed , within 3 years . The study involved discussion of a sensitive topic , yet microaggressions are everyday occurrences for BPs , as the data confirmed . In case of distress during interviews , help was available in that interviewers were psychiatric nurses who could intervene and make necessary referrals . No untoward events occurred during interviews . A few partici - pants became tearful ; laughter was more frequent , which in some cases might indicate anxiety . No intervention beyond a brief pause was necessary . Procedure Men and women above 18 years of age , identifying as African American or Black , who could read and write in English were included . Exclusion criteria included acute mental / physical distress and cognitive impairment . Cognitive impairment was assessed using a simple clock - drawing test . Participants were initially recruited through researchers’ contacts , flyers , and referral ( snowball ) sampling from initial participants . Semi - structured but reasonably open - ended interviews , lasting from 60 to 120 minutes , were conducted at university office or in participants’ homes . A US $ 50 gift card was given to thank participants for their time . The card was given directly after consent and not used as an incentive to complete the interview . Because this study was limited to Black adults , age and gender were purposefully diversified , but experiences of children , other POC , LGBTQI persons , and so forth should not be considered commensurate with these findings . Demographic Data We collected the following demographic data : age , self - iden - tified race / ethnicity , employment status , education , and level and adequacy of income . We also administered several scales Hall and Fields 5 by pencil and paper , including perceived stress , quality of life , and rating of physical and mental health , to pilot these instruments . Here , we are specifically reporting on the narra - tive analysis . We administered the scales after the interview so as not to bias the choices of stories participants might tell in the interviews . Data Management and Analysis The analysis procedure was as follows : ( a ) an initial read - through identified the genre and form of the participant’s whole account and was compared as needed for clarification , with the sound files and / or field notes , which also provided accuracy and context ; ( b ) narratives were blocked out or “chunked” into meaningful utterances of a few words to a few paragraphs that revealed specific stories ; ( c ) narratives of microaggression incidents were examined for plotlines of what occurred and how the participant responded . We identi - fied health symptoms or problems attributed to the experi - ence of the microaggression at hand , or generally attributed to microaggressions occurring over years ; ( d ) summary nar - rative accounts of individual participants were written , and the basic stories of 6 of the 10 were identified as iconic , rep - resenting diverse life contexts , and responses to microag - gressions ; and ( e ) quotations were selected illustrating reported incidents , strategies used , and health effects . The researchers reached consensus on the most illustrative and rich stories and representative quotes . Rigor and Validity Multiple readers , iterative readings , and discussion of pro - cesses involved in identifying and naming findings helped to increase reflexivity and reinforce consensus . In addition , a dual approach was effectively used : a descriptive categorical analysis of small utterances and composite derivation of integrated , iconic narratives showing life contexts of indi - viduals’ microaggression experiences . Thus , major criteria for rigor included rapport , credibility , verisimilitude , coher - ence of accounts , and reflexivity in analysis , all of which were sufficiently met . An audit trail revealed decision points and rationales for analysis and achieving consensus . Results The findings are organized as follows : ( a ) participant profile ; ( b ) microaggressions experienced ; ( c ) strategies used to stop microaggressions , avoid them , and / or attenuate their effects ; and ( d ) health - related experiences associated with microag - gressions , including health care interactions ; and ( e ) six iconic , summarized accounts . Participant Profile The brief demographic information is summarized in Table 1 . Although these participants were well educated , under - employment and unemployment were evident . Seven rated their income as inadequate to meet their needs . Paradoxically , most self - rated their quality of life and health as good to excellent , despite that accounts indicated many stress symptoms . Microaggressions Experienced Although usually open - ended interviews are used in narra - tive research , we began with specific questions posing sce - narios and examples of microaggressions . We elicited narratives of incidents , and these were reported in story form . However , we use only brief quotes rather than whole stories in illustrating these categories . Later , we report more narra - tively contextualized interactions in the six iconic accounts . See Table 2 detailing microaggressions experienced . The reported microaggressions shared some commonali - ties . Most incidents happened at work , but also on the street , in WPs homes , and in stores or businesses . Each participant reported multiple types of microaggressions , though indi - viduals did not experience all of the examples in the taxon - omy . Gender differences included that assumptions of criminality were worse for men . Especially , younger men reported that they were frequently stopped by the police ( though this was not asked about as an exemplar microag - gression and is in many cases a more severe aggression ) .

Microaggressions Experienced . Microaggression Description Quotes Assumptions of criminality Avoiding BP based on fear , seeing Whites clutching belongings , etc . Followed in a store , being unable to hail a taxi , etc . The minute they think you will steal something , they ride on your trail . I’m watching over my shoulder . Uncomfortable . They watch you but don’t speak . Makes me angry . Surprise at intelligence / achievement Statements indicating intelligence is unexpected when encountered in a BP Man , they are calling all these Blacks intelligent because they are educated . Do they think we are all illiterate ? Overfamiliarity Assuming closeness or similarity of feeling with minorities They say “Oh I love that song . ” Or “Do you cook this ? ” Don’t entertain me like that . Nah . . . I mean , I don’t know you . Stereotyping Assuming sameness of members of a group They assume that all Blacks think alike , when everyone has their own opinion . Makes you feel small . They want to lump you all together . Underestimating inferiorization Statements indicating assumption of White superiority and Black defectiveness There’s not a genuine . . . positive expectation in any sense . Because their grandfather was in a high military position , they think they should still be in charge . We come out the womb having to prove ourselves . Infantilizing Considering BP immature , individually or as a group All African Americans are thought of as children . . . You were a slave and you must know your place . It’s either overt or very subtle . Just have to do what you are told . . . but I can’t model that to my kids ! Conformity / abnormality Implications that white appearance is best , that White = normality If I wear a head wrap they gawk , stare a hole in the back of your head . Why do Black men have to wear their hair short ? Some WPs have theirs dyed purple . Look as white as possible . . . I don’t want to be too African , too Black . Exoticism Excessive curiosity , objectifying BP as foreign or strange Staring at me as if I am on display . I understand it is different from what you are used to , but its offensive . You act like you are scared to touch . They think Black men are sexual animals . Loss of job , forced out Job lost or not gotten , assumed to be racially motivated . Exceeds “micro” aggression . When I lost my job , was terminated , I wanted to be sure it would not happen to someone else . I can’t afford to be sick . I’m stressed . . . I worry . Name - calling Using demeaning language , hate speech They yell , “nigger” and I want to throw a brick at them , but I don’t . She ( White woman ) was recalling what someone else did , and she said he said , “look at those niggers dance ! ” I didn’t need the whole detail that he had called them “niggers . ” Did she really say that ? ! Denial of racism in society Refuting structural and / or subtle racism . Statements about society as “post - racial , ” that racism is now resolved . Very little understanding . . . It is them ( WPs ) assuming and declaring what is in their own minds . It’s “why are you guys still talking about that ? ” I was angry . . . little understanding of the dynamics of the Black community and what has happened historically . Denial of personal racism Refusing to acknowledge prejudices and White privilege . When they say “I wasn’t there , or I did not do those things ( slavery , Jim Crow ) . . . Well I guarantee someone behind you , he did ! ” She always said “I’m not prejudiced . ” Held back Promoting less qualified WP . Not giving BP a chance to succeed . Selectively biased hiring , renting , and so on . White people think they should still be in control . . . hold Blacks back . It is because of your color . . . you try to get ahead in the company , struggling to even get your foot in the door . That brings stress . They don’t call you back . Colorblindness Stating , “we are all the same , ” or “I don’t see color . ” I would like to pick their brains . . . what do they mean ? Never expected it from that person ! You see the differences , you see color ! It is what it is . Ignoring / invisibility Avoidance , not seeing or hearing what BP is saying . Looking past or “through” the BP . I had thought of ways to make my work easier . No one listens . They think I’m crazy . At work , they make you feel small . I’m here ! Frustrating . Note . BP = Black person ; WP = White person . Hall and Fields 7 Laughter was associated with several microaggression examples , especially that of being mistaken for a service worker , reportedly because it was “embarrassing to the WP . ” However , there was also some anxious laughter associated with telling of painful incidents . In general , most reported being unsurprised that microaggressions occur , but , at the time of the incidents , most also reported having felt humili - ated , demeaned , diminished , stunned , helpless , angry , disap - pointed , betrayed , and so on . Paradoxically , participants recalled feeling “invisible , ” yet often in non - verbal interac - tions with WPs , they were “stared at , ” as if hyper - visible . Most participants mentioned President Obama and the disrespectful way that many WPs consider and talk about him . Many participants commented that , currently , racism was more “behind your back” and thus less detectable . Participants stated they preferred overt racism to covert rac - ism , noting that it was clearer , not producing time - consum - ing doubts and the need to decipher ambiguous motives of White perpetrators . Strategies in Response to Microaggressions We constructed a comprehensive list of the identified strate - gies with terse exemplar quotes . The exemplars serve to define and also show diversity of responses . See the sum - mary of strategies in Table 3 . Clearly , participants tried a variety of strategies , although few strategies yielded positive results or reduced stress . An apt analogy was “dropping back two steps” when microag - gressions occurred and struggling to get back to the original place , costing time and extra effort . It seemed to be uphill to begin with , and the effects of microaggressions kept one from moving forward , for variable amounts of time . Confrontation was empowering , but it often increased ani - mosity and could endanger employment . Processing the inci - dent with others took up time . Worse , if it became the focus of peer and family conversation , this exacerbated the intru - siveness of microaggressions into everyday life . Avoidance fostered social isolation . Intensive preparation and “over - achieving” reportedly led to exhaustion . Insomnia often accompanied ruminating over incidents . Giving a pass and moving on were the most frequent strategies . Yet saying nothing , moving on , and walking away could foster internal - ization of negative feelings . And , obviously , all of these strategies required effort that , comparatively , WPs do not have to expend . Physical and Mental Effects Linked to Microaggressions Following is a comprehensive list of the adverse emotional and health effects attributed by the participants to microag - gression experiences . As is obvious , these were diverse and many are medically serious and foster other increased risks . We did not explore these effects in detail , but the total num - ber we saw was unexpectedly diverse . See Table 4 . Iconic Narratives Recognizing the importance of holism and the diversity of life contexts , interpretations of microaggressions , and health - related consequences , we selected summary constructions of six individual , iconic narratives . These “cameos” also included some of others’ similar quotes and life circum - stances , where appropriate . Thus , they are composites , and identifiers and details were changed to additionally protect confidentiality . These narratives contextualize the categori - cal data already presented . Carmen . Carmen , in her late 30s , worked in a public school . Her supervisor was a White woman who often mentioned having “biracial children , ” as a means to establish that she could not be biased . There was habitual conflict with this White woman , who repeatedly slighted the African Ameri - can children , but favored Latinos and White children , in dis - tributing school supplies . Carmen eventually confronted her , cautioning , “Everyone sees what you are doing ! ” In response to microaggressions , especially targeting others , she made direct verbal replies . The White woman once commented on Carmen’s color using the negative “woodshed” imagery . Carmen directly replied , underscoring that sexual exploita - tion of Black women by White men “comes from slavery . ” Carmen was haunted by the stressful micro - and macroag - gressions in the workplace that then pressurized the home / family environment . “It brings it home , . . . yelling and screaming at my husband and kids . ” Carmen perceived WPs as aware of their offensive comments indicating , “BPs are beneath them . ” Carmen discussed the events and history surrounding WP’s treatment of the president . She believed that President Obama’s election stirred Black – White conflict , but she did not imply that things were fine before then . “I don’t think those ( disrespectful ) things would be said if he [ president ] was White . ” She saw BPs stuck at the bottom of a hierarchy , below other minorities . She expressed anger and rage , and has chronic insomnia , anxiety , and “stress . ” She reported social avoidance , that she wants to “get out of the room” any - time the above - mentioned White woman is there . The micro - aggressions led to days of sleepless rumination and anger . Concerning denial of racism and Whites who say they are “colorblind , ” she said , [ I think ] what did that person mean by that ? Do you mean that we’re all equal ?

Interviewer ( I ) : “Is there anything that you can imagine they would say that would convince you of that ? ” Participant ( P ) : ( silence ) No . 8 Global Qualitative Nursing Research This example demonstrates the level of confusion and doubts raised by denials of racism . Trying to figure out the meanings in microaggressive statements by WPs is baffling and arduous . This account raises many mental and social health concerns , and the micro - / macroaggressions occurring in the workplace are the most inescapable and high risk . This situation with an individual White woman in a position of authority was a subtext to the whole interview . Note that making a verbal response to a microaggression was not evidenced here as a relief or as stress reducing . Carmen did not give “passes” on microaggressions , though she often ignored them until it would become impossible for her not to say something . Nathan . Nathan , in his mid - 20s , lived with his White woman partner of 5 years . When asked about several microaggres - sions , macro - level incidents emerge . He described frequently being stopped by the police and recounted that his Black men Table 3 . Strategies in Response to Microaggressions .

Hall and Fields 9 friends experience this “all the time . It’s the norm . ” When stopped over a “seat belt” when he was wearing one , he reported feeling “fear , helpless , adrenaline , heart pumping . ” Assumptions of criminality predominated , though there was no evidence that Nathan had committed crimes . Often stopped in stores , he considered this laughable , as is being mistaken for a service worker , because he believes the WP doing this “haven’t been trained , ” ( as children ) . Thus , he would give a pass in this situation . When asked about stereotyping , he implicated his girl - friend first , stating that frequent arguments over money would degenerate into his girlfriend calling him a “thug” or stating he had “thug - like behavior . ” Nathan would become “upset , ” but he would give her passes , presumably to keep his intimate relationship . He saw BPs as still “oppressed” but saw improvement in that “more people have jobs now . ” His responses to microaggressions varied , but descriptions of bodily feelings were vivid , especially regarding pronounced anger and fear . “I feel TENSION ! ” This account points to the elevated risks faced by young Black men and boys , especially as targets of police profiling or in potentially being attacked over WP’s fears that they might become “violent . ” Nathan’s physiological and psycho - logical responses were pronounced , characterizing a trau - matic experience , although in summing up , he did not see his health as affected at this point . A life risk that is high for Black men is incarceration , often for nonviolent crimes , or through judicial bias . A pertinent future health concern for Nathan is hypertension , which results from , or is exacerbated by , frequent adrenaline - increased states . Tuni . Tuni , in her early 30s , graduated from an Ivy League university and quickly turned to this as a constant source of demeaning microaggressions and her subsequent angry reac - tions . WPs , shocked at knowing where Tuni was educated , often asked , “How did you get in ? ” Although not confron - tive , she tended to let the person know that she did not miss the slight . When this would happen , she would cut off the conversation , as well as the relationship , wanting nothing further to do with the person who commented with surprise about her education . She would think , “I don’t have to explain anything to you . There is nothing I want to say to you . ” She had a managerial position but concentrated her career story on the daily set of contingencies , hassles , and pressures to “not look too Black . ” She talked at length about the persistent pressures associated with keeping her hair straight . She reported repeatedly being exoticized in the question by WPs if they can “touch her hair . ” She felt “like an animal in a petting zoo . ” Though these were repetitive events , she felt surprised and acutely puzzled each time they Table 4 .

That alone is crazy . That will stress you out and you don’t even know how crazy you’ll be after years and years . That was so ingrained in our mindsets that that’s the only way that we’ll get a job . That’s the only way to be accepted . . . if you wore your hair in an Afro or . . . other than straight then that would not be acceptable either . I see WP all the time with nose piercings or blue hair but when BP do it it’s considered “ghetto . ” Another woman who said that the time , the money , the effort it takes to look “closer , closer to White” was incredible and fed into negative self - concept : “So we look into the mir - ror and say , yeah , we’re ugly . And then you live with that . ” A man expressed , You know that’s the de facto standard . . . It’s not it’s not written , it’s not in the law , it’s not in the law book , . . . we’re just faced with that . You say “man ya’ll got to cut ya’ll beards’ . . . We started saying , ‘so why are these things important ? What’s too Black ! ? ” Tuni had friends of different races / cultures , traveled to countries where Black – White hierarchy is minimal , and saw the possibilities of people getting along human to human . She then said , however , “I absolutely do believe in the word racism . ” She reported that daily stress of the pressures to conform to White standards gave her constant pain in her upper back and shoulders , which lasts for days to weeks . She stated that strategies in response to microaggressions also include trying to explain to WP , but this was usually done when the individual is known , a coworker , or a friend . Her efforts usually came to naught as the WP would become defensive and deny racism . Another Black woman explained that she tried to help a White friend understand that BPs often have long waits and get ignored by clerks , just as the White woman had experienced ( and had become furious ) . This Black woman stated that this created “enormous ten - sion ! ” and concluded that trying to teach WP did not work very well . Roxanne . Roxanne , in her late 30s , recounted victimization in a series of employment - associated microaggressions that created a macroaggressive environment , as White coworkers acted together against her interests . Initially , White women asked , “How did you get this position ? ” Besides making microaggressive comments , one woman also seemed to be jockeying for Roxanne’s job : “How did you get your experi - ence ? ” The White coworkers’ overfamiliarity in discussing what music Roxanne likes , and telling her “I love greens , ” also seemed disingenuous to her , and she called it “overkill” and “deceptive . ” A prevailing perception in this geographic area was that there is a Black glass ceiling , which stops the BP from advancement and places them at risk , especially if they supervise a number of WPs . Likewise , other participants also said they feel “held back , ” and that “they only let a few in , and then the door closes . ” The group of White women in this professional job set - ting effectively scapegoated and bullied Roxanne , splitting her from her boss , who was a POC and had been protective of Roxanne in the past . After “an investigation , ” suddenly Roxanne , a very competent employee , was fired “over a cler - ical error that everyone makes . ” Her situation changed from microaggressive office politics to a macroaggressive , biased firing . This initiated a cascade of negative events , including loss of any friends from the workplace , social isolation , exhaustion , anger , loss of income , loss of health insurance , depression , anxiety , insomnia , headaches , back problems , neck aches , digestive problems , and weight loss of 35 pounds . She used the terms frustration and aggravation fre - quently . “WPs should stand up for you , and they don’t . ” Comparing this geographic area with a city where she previ - ously lived , she said since she moved here , she has begun to see that “there is Black and there is White , ” emphasizing that now she “sees color , ” adding that she becomes “judgmental , like the rest of them . ” Roxanne also stated that her husband tended to be treated with more assumptions of criminality than she experienced , specifically mentioning how WPs people lock their car doors when he would walk by . These things enraged him , because they reminded him of an early traumatic situation : being expelled from high school due to a fight with a White boy ( who was not expelled ) . After decades , this was still emo - tionally unresolved . Roxanne stated he was affected by hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . Roxanne’s narrative demonstrated the continuum of and con - nections between micro - and more overt macroaggressions , and her story of her husband showed the experiential connec - tion between current microaggressions and prior traumatic situations . This is veritably the same as an abused person having “triggering” experiences that reactivate memories of past trauma , in a vicious cycle . For Roxanne , when a WP claimed to be “colorblind , ” this was considered problematic , especially frustrating , and incomprehensible . But BPs such as Roxanne do not consider it good if they themselves “see color . ” The premise is that they should not have to see color . “It should not come in there . ” Raymond . Raymond , in his late 30s , worked in a health field . He noted WPs sometimes begin sentences with “I am not a racist , ” to which he would respond with hypervigilance , that is , watching for these things and being self - protective . I know that is a red flag . . . I will watch you from then on . I’m gonna be paying attention to you and what you do and what you say and how you act anytime I’m around you , for as long as I’m Hall and Fields 11 around you . . . These are the things that have happened in the past and they continue to happen , just a little differently . Now the more I pay attention the more subtle I see it’s gotten . Raymond is a large man , and said he often sees people clutch their belongings around him . He seemed to take this for granted . He described situations where a BP does not get the job , or the loan , or the apartment , and then never knows if it was racial , regardless of an explanation , if any is given , for hiring a WP instead . He underscored , “But as long I’m around , I’m gonna make sure that I pay attention to you [ WP ] and your actions . . . It ends up being a lot of extra thinking you have to do , but it’s second nature . ” Others echoed the idea of vigilance , and stated that they watched for body language and skin tone when WPs deny racism : “You can tell they are lying by their red face . ” Raymond firmly believed that racism is not innate but learned early in life from one’s parents . When he was 17 , he had an indelible experience of microassault . He was chasing a ball on the street , and a White toddler yelled “nigger , nigger ! ” A baby stopped me in my tracks ( laughing ) ! Literally I mean . . . I froze , and my first ( laugh ) thought and my first emotion was anger . I mean without a doubt . . . and then I was like “Oh my God . ” I walked up to some of the older kids . . . ( laugh ) and it gets wilder . I said , “Where is this child’s parents ? I need to have a talk with the dad , the mom , anybody . Whoever’s here . ” And ( laugh ) and I was angry and ( laugh ) this is what ( laugh ) took all the anger away— what was said next . . . “Well , his parents aren’t here . We’re with a church group . ” ( Laughing ) . . . I was so stunned by that . That was probably my first real serious kind of racially motive , it bothered me and it hurt my feelings too . ” Raymond considered himself in good health and said he has had health insurance for most of his life . He then recounted a story of an aunt who was forced to seek care at the health department , and without adequate assessment and follow - up , was merely prescribed a medication , and got sicker and sicker . When her kidneys failed , the family learned that , in fact , the medication had ruined her kidneys . Raymond said , “It killed her . She died because of that . ” Raymond’s story about being vigilant is contrasted with his earlier - occurring story , when he was surprised by a situation , “stunned . ” Presumably , he became more vigilant after this incident , to which he referred several times in the interview . This also reinforces that current microaggressions and strate - gies are linked to early micro - or macroaggressive traumatic events . Harrison . Harrison was in his mid - 50s . He stated , “WPs have to let you know they are in charge , ” as though little in society had changed . He discussed his boss starting a sentence with “I like BPs . . . ” then proceeding to give him the least desir - able tasks . They will hire somebody in to be our boss and that really makes me upset instead of giving one of us the chance to be the boss . I : “When you say , ‘upset , ’ what does that mean ? ” P : “Hm , well I try not to be racist ah , but that sometimes it just makes you feel racist . . . Ah , I feel the anger cause they still holding us back instead of promoting us , they’d rather hire somebody out the street to be your boss instead . . . you’re working in the plant all these years and then [ they ] hire somebody out to come in to be your boss , younger than you , that’s what really makes me upset . ” Harrison recounted a microaggression of denial of racism and colorblindness by a White veteran who thought that there were no color lines in the army , that all were “treated the same . ” Harrison said he gave him a pass . Harrison often gave a pass based on age , misconception or lack of educa - tion , and so on . He also tended to laugh at being followed in a store , and he found it even funnier to be mistaken for a service worker , because this shows White “stupidity . ” Despite sometimes giving passes , he stated that racism is very real but is now more “undercover . ” However , he saw the president as having been overtly ill spoken of throughout his term and that this was disrespectful and indicated animus toward all BPs . “Having them say the president would not be a good leader , it is very stressful . ” Harrison was exoticized in coworkers’ constant remarks about him and his anatomy , and said , “They think Blacks are sexual animals . . . They won’t just let me live . ” Harrison also emphasized how BPs are “held back” in many situations , flowing from slavery patterns wherein BPs were treated as children . The boss , “He be like your daddy ! ” Harrison hopelessly described how little chance he had of getting a new job as he approached 60 . He implied that he had quit his job over conflicts with this White boss , when he said of employment - related microaggressions , “ [ Microaggressions ] make us so angry that we quit our jobs early . ” Twenty years prior , he was incarcerated for a nonviolent crime . They won’t let you go forward . You can’t do a crime . You can’t go forward . Everywhere I go , and that’s over 20 years , I still get held back for the same thing—I try to move on—They won’t let you . Harrison’s insurance agent did not respond to recent storm damage to his home , leaving him without a roof in part of his house for 3 months . He noted that WPs with the same prob - lem were getting assistance relatively easily , and their houses were already repaired . This exemplified environmental or situational microaggression . Harrison vividly described perceiving his blood pressure going up when he experienced microaggressions : Stress goes to anger . . . feel like a heat wave or just a little you know , just something you know you just feel . You can feel , you just , he’s [ boss ] a coming and getting on your nerve or something and you get high [ blood pressure ] , it makes your anger something different , came from your body like you know something , you know . Then it comes back down . . . I can’t explain but it ah , you know I know feel ah , different . 12 Global Qualitative Nursing Research He continued , saying that when WPs say offensive or demeaning things , he calls them names to himself , but that sometimes “It slips out . ” He says this gives him some relief but implies that it backfires in the long run . He reassured himself that because he feels his blood pressure goes down , no real harm is occurring , but then dispelled this by saying , “Over time , it has to have an effect on your health . Stress is a killer . ” His health was precarious because of lack of income and access , and he was prone to environmental stressors such as exposure and questionable nutrition . He seemed socially iso - lated but described a good relationship with his pastor that was a great help to him . He gives me food for thought to keep me , you know , and I try to look to the Bible a lot . . . I hope my religion is a stress relief . . . I’m one true believer in that . He was one of the two who stated that religion or spiritu - ality is helpful in dealing with subtle or overt racism , although this was not asked directly . Discussion We found that there were varied and multiple microaggres - sions experienced by a diverse group of BPs , there are some gender differences , and responses to microaggressions vary from giving a pass to confrontation , with no particular strat - egy showing great success . This study suggests certain cop - ing strategies , such as vigilance , might attenuate the shock of facing a microaggression , yet others ( Liu & Lau , 2013 ) found that hypervigilance increases depression and pessimistic mis - trust . We also found that microaggressions can trigger intru - sive memories of traumatic racially related incidents . This supports that for some , microaggressions are experienced as traumatic events , which is of serious concern . Many of the same principles used to care for survivors of abusive trauma might be adapted to explore and intervene on effects of racial microaggressions , referred to as trauma - informed care . A plethora of physical and mental adversities are attrib - uted to these daily indignities , and overall , participants believe that subtle interpersonal racism has cumulative stress effects . No participant reported that being the target of micro - aggressions was conducive to well - being . There was agree - ment that these microaggressive incidents contribute to the stress load already burdening the person , whether that is stig - matizing stereotyping , intersecting minority statuses , or eco - nomic / income inequality . However , there may be some means or theories of coping that might be helpful in combin - ing strategies or in attenuating the initial stress microaggres - sions generate . This analysis demonstrated the commonness of microag - gressions for Black / African American persons . Participants had many diverse reactions to , interpretations of , the strate - gies used to counter these socio - micro - traumatic incidents . There was nearly unanimous agreement that racism is now subtle and that the United States is clearly not post - racial . Likewise , there was a pattern of concerns when WP make microaggressive remarks about the president , and for many participants , this reflects how WPs view all BPs . There is therefore also a ripple effect to witnessing microaggressions and being aware of them in the media . When POC recounted their experiences with microag - gressions , effects of negative microaggressive messages , attributed health consequences , and clues to behavioral path - ways of interpersonal racism were illuminated . Presumably , if WPs understood the stressful effects of these insidiously biased behaviors , the majority would stop doing them . Yet how aware are WPs of their microaggressive behaviors ? The issue of whether WPs are aware when communicat - ing microaggressions was not settled here , and this should be explored further . Some participants did allude to WP denying racism and who appeared to be “lying . ” But overall there was an unexpected lack of focus on this point . Does this mean that intentionality does not matter ? Does it mean that inten - tion cannot be determined in interactions ? Intentionality questions are raised by this study , but were not within its scope as the issue was not explored directly . Giving a pass would seem to be based on BPs assuming that WPs are not aware of what they are saying and doing or are unaware of how it is perceived . There were , however , several contradict - ing responses from participants about this such as references to lying , which evidence perceived intentionality . Future Research Directions for future research include ( a ) in - depth and detailed examination of strategies to facilitate developing interven - tions that decrease the exposure to and negative effects of microaggressions , ( b ) studies specifically focused on micro - aggressions in health care contexts , and ( c ) exploration and intervention development for raising WP’s consciousness of their own microaggressions , and moreover , those they do not challenge when they witness them done by other WPs . This is especially crucial in the health and other service professions . A goal of future research stemming from findings on strategies would be the development of interventions to increase POC knowledge of strategies that do and do not prove helpful . The hurdle here is that the experiences and interpretations of specific types of microaggressions vary within life contexts . Yet researchers could utilize focus groups to explore strategies in detail and capture some con - sensus from BPs about helpfulness of specific strategies matched to types of racial microaggressions . Theory Development Theory development will likely follow a research - theory path . As we can measure more and more types of microag - gressions and determine which are the most stressful , com - prehensive theories can be developed about microaggressions generally , and micro theories can be developed regarding Hall and Fields 13 subgroups , such as those who are immigrants , sexual minori - ties , living with challenges to abilities , and women . Also , this should be integrated with CRT to capture power dynamics of microaggressions and with intersectionality theories to cap - ture the complexities of experiencing multiple forms of microaggressions . The situation is longstanding but has urgent clinical impli - cations . One participant sums the situation up , along with its dire consequences : It’s a killer , it is killing us . . . It becomes stressful and we all know stress can have many different effects . Stressful because you constantly thinking about what’s taken place , whether it is that day , that week , you’re thinking about it , and it affects you personally . It affects how you perceive things in the world . It still falls back on the person . Whether that is becoming angry at society about how it has been laid out or [ how racism is ] communicated to BPs . It’s not healthy at all . It’s not healthy at all . It’s not healthy .
