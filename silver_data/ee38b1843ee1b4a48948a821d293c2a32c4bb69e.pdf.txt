J Appl Physiol 91 : 65 – 73 , 2001 . —With the use of magnetic twisting cytometry , we characterized the mechan - ical properties of rat type II alveolar epithelial ( ATII ) cells in primary culture and examined whether the cells’ state of differentiation and the application of deforming stresses in - ﬂuence their resistance to shape change . Cells were har - vested from rat lungs as previously described ( Dobbs LG . Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 258 : L134 – L147 , 1990 ) and plated at a density of 1 3 10 6 cells / cm 2 in ﬁbronectin - coated 96 Remova wells , and their mechanical properties were measured 2 – 9 days later . We show 1 ) that ATII cells form much stronger bonds with RGD - coated beads than they do with albumin - or acetylated low - density lipoprotein - coated beads , 2 ) that RGD - mediated bonds seemingly “ma - ture” during the ﬁrst 60 min of bead contact , 3 ) that the apparent stiffness of ATII cells increases with days in cul - ture , 4 ) that stiffness falls when the RGD - coated beads are intermittently oscillated at 0 . 3 Hz , and 5 ) that this fall cannot be attributed to exocytosis - related remodeling of the subcortical cytoskeleton . Although the mechanisms of force transfer between basement membrane , cytoskeleton , and plasma membrane of ATII cells remain to be resolved , such analyses undoubtedly require deﬁnition of the cell’s mechan - ical properties . To our knowledge , the results presented here provide the ﬁrst data on this topic . mechanical stress ; lung injury ; cytoskeleton ; magnetic twist - ing cytometry ; cell adhesion IN THE PAST DECADE , THE VENTILATORY management of patients with injured lungs has undergone a major paradigm shift ( 1 , 11 ) . Whereas the old paradigm con - sidered the sole goal of mechanical ventilation to be the correction of gas exchange failure , the new paradigm seeks to provide “physical therapy” to an injured lung . This new paradigm embraces the hypothesis that rate and amplitude of lung deformation affect numerous lung cell metabolic functions and , consequently , mod - ulate transcellular as well as intercellular ﬂuid trans - port , mechanisms of inﬂammation , host defense , and wound repair . Because rat type II alveolar epithelial ( ATII ) cells are a popular culture model of the distal air space ( 30 ) , a number of studies have sought to charac - terize cellular deformation responses using this sys - tem . Accordingly , it has been shown that mechanical distension of ATII cells in vitro causes calcium mobili - zation , stimulates surfactant secretion ( 46 ) , and accel - erates expression of type I cell characteristics ( 17 ) . Mechanical strain has been found to cause changes in cell morphology , alterations in cell cycle , and modiﬁcations of DNA synthesis and protein produc - tion in many different cell systems ( 14 , 15 , 21 , 25 , 47 ) . Proposed mechanisms and molecular pathways governing mechanochemical signaling are numerous and include stretch - activated ion channels , intra - and intercellular calcium ﬂux , G protein - dependent and - independent kinase pathways , and the biopoly - mers of the cytoskeleton that physically link matrix - bound adhesion receptors and focal adhesion com - plexes ( FACs ) to the nucleus , chromosomes , and stress - responsive genes ( 4 , 21 , 25 , 28 ) . Because all these mechanisms operate in parallel , attributing deformation - related inﬂammatory signal transduc - tion to any one pathway to the exclusion of the others is not justiﬁed . Although in some cells , stress - re - sponsive elements have been identiﬁed and cloned , the site of mechanosensing in epithelial cells , and speciﬁcally in ATII cells , has not been established . Ingber ( 21 , 22 ) and Maniotis et al . ( 28 ) consistently argued that the cytoskeleton , which is a prestressed network of molecular connections , provides a dis - crete path for mechanical signal transfer as well as a mechanism for producing integrated changes in cell and nuclear structure in response to mechanical stress . By actively regulating shape and stiffness , cells can adapt so that the same chemical or mechan - ical input produces a different output ( cellular re - sponse ) , much like changing the tension of a string alters its pitch ( 23 ) . It is in this context that we sought to characterize the mechanical properties of ATII cells in culture and to examine whether their state of differentiation and the application of deform - ing stresses inﬂuence their resistance to shape change .

ATII cells were harvested as described by Dobbs ( 8 ) . Sprague - Dawley rats ( 300 – 400 g ) were anesthe - tized by injection with pentobarbital sodium ( 70 mg / kg body wt ip ) , injected with 300 U of heparin , and euthanized by cutting the inferior vena cava . The trachea was cannulated with a 14 - gauge catheter . After cannulation of the right ventricle , the lungs were perfused with 40 ml of solution II ( in mM : 140 NaCl , 5 KCl , 2 . 5 NaPO 4 , 10 HEPES , 1 . 3 MgSO 4 , and 2 . 0 CaCl 2 ) . The lungs were lavaged multiple times with solution I ( in mM : 140 NaCl , 5 KCl , 2 . 5 NaPO 4 , 10 HEPES , 6 glucose , and 0 . 2 EGTA ) and once with elastase solution ( 30 elastase units / ml dissolved in solution II ) . Subsequently , the heart and lungs were excised en bloc , heart and trachea were removed , and the remaining lung tissue was incubated with the balance of elastase for 10 min and then minced with DNase ( type I , 250 m g / ml ) . After the enzymatic activity was stopped with 5 ml of fetal calf serum ( FCS ; GIBCO BRL , Grand Island , NY ) , the mixture was incubated for 2 min in a 37°C shaking bath and then ﬁltered once through gauze and twice through nylon mesh ( 150 - and 15 - m m pore size ; Sefar - America , Kansas City , MO ) . The solution was then centri - fuged for 10 min at 1 , 000 rpm , the supernatant was dis - carded , and the cells were reconstituted in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( GIBCO BRL ) without FCS . The cells were plated on IgG - coated petri dishes for 1 h . The media and nonadherent cells were aspirated and centrifuged for 10 min at 1 , 000 rpm . The supernatant was discarded , the cells were resuspended in 30 ml of Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Ea - gle’s medium with FCS , and cells were counted . Cells were then plated ( 1 3 10 6 cells / well ) to ﬁbronectin - coated 96 mi - crowells ( Removawell , Dynatech Laboratories , Chantilly , VA ) . Cell morphology . Cell projection imaging and measure - ments were performed by a modiﬁcation of the protocol of Vlahakis and colleagues ( 43 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were lipid labeled with FM1 - 43 and immediately viewed with an argon ion laser confocal microscope ( model FUX - SU , Olympus , Mel - ville , NY ) on an upright microscope ( model BX50W1 , Olym - pus ) using a 3 40 water immersion lens ( Carl Zeiss , Thorn - wood , NY ) . The excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 and . 515 nm , respectively . Surface area projection mea - surements were calculated with ANALYZE ( Mayo Founda - tion , Rochester , MN ) . Data are presented as a percentage of total number of cells imaged vs . projected area . Intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 receptor expression . Intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) receptor ex - pression at the cell surface was measured after 1 , 4 , and 7 days in culture as previously described ( 2 , 6 , 19 ) . Cells were washed twice with ELISA wash buffer ( PBS , 2 % FCS , and 1 % Tween 20 ) and ﬁxed for 10 min with 2 % parafor - maldehyde at 4°C . Cells were incubated for 30 min with peroxidase blocking buffer ( 0 . 3 % H 2 O 2 in water ) and for 60 min with 5 % powdered milk in wash buffer with a primary anti - ICAM - 1 antibody ( mA129 , Cape Cod , Falmouth , MA ) or a nonspeciﬁc control antibody ( mouse anti - rat IgG ) and a secondary antibody ( sheep anti - mouse IgG - horseradish peroxidase ; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) . Horseradish peroxidase was developed for 15 min with a peroxidase substrate , o - phenylenediamine ( 1a ) . Op - tical density at 490 nm ( Versamax microplate reader , Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) served as a measure of ICAM - 1 expression . Plasma membrane integrin receptor expression . ATII cells were grown on ﬁbronectin - coated Lab - Tek chambered cover glass ( Nalge Nunc , Naperville , IL ) for 1 and 4 days . The cells were incubated at 37°C for 30 min with dansylated RGD peptide ( Telios Pharmaceuticals , San Diego , CA ) , washed with PBS , and subsequently ﬁxed for 10 min at 4°C with 2 % paraformaldehyde . Cells were illuminated at a wavelength of 360 nm , viewed with an inverted microscope ( model IX70 - S1F2 , Olympus ) , and imaged with a charge coupled device ( model C4742 - 95 , Hamamatsu , Bridgewater , NJ ) , and ﬂuo - rescence was measured at an emission peak of 460 nm using the imaging package MetaMorph ( Universal Imaging , West Chester , PA ) . Magnetic twisting cytometry . Ferromagnetic ( Fe 3 O 4 ) microbeads ( 4 . 5 m m diameter , magnetic moment 5 4 A z m 2 z kg 2 1 ) were coated with a synthetic RGD peptide ( Pep - tite ; Telios Pharmaceuticals ) or acetylated low - density li - poprotein ( LDL ; Biomedical Technology , Stoughton , MA ) at 50 m g / ml or incubated in bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) . The RGD - , BSA - , or acetylated LDL - coated beads were dispersed in serum - free medium and added to each well at 20 m g / well ( 1 – 2 beads / cell ) for 20 min . Unbound beads were washed away before magnetic twisting cytometry ( MTC ) measure - ments ( 20 , 44 ) . Cell wells were placed into the magnetic twisting cytometer and kept at 37°C . A 10 - m s , 1 , 000 - gauss homogeneous magnetic pulse was then applied to magnetize the beads in the horizontal direction . A ﬂux - gate magnetom - eter ( Foerster , Reutlingen , Germany ) was used to measure the remnant magnetic ﬁeld of the beads in the horizontal direction ( B r ) . Values for B r are typically ; 1 nT . A magnetic “twisting” ﬁeld ( , 80 gauss ) , H , was applied in the vertical direction to twist the beads upward . Cell mechanical proper - ties were derived from twisting torque and angular bead rotation ( 44 , 45 ) . During twisting , the speciﬁc torque T ( i . e . , torque per unit bead volume ) produced by a bead is as follows : T 5 c p H p cos ( a ) , with the angular bead rotation ( a ) and the “bead constant” ( c ) expressed as torque per unit bead volume per gauss ; c is determined by placing beads in a ﬂuid of known viscosity and measuring the velocity of rotation during twist . The bead’s speciﬁc magnetic saturation moment of 5 A z m 2 z kg 2 1 thus results in c of 4 . 1 dyn z cm 2 2 z gauss 2 1 . In principle , when the beads are placed in an inﬁnite elastic medium , they generate a shear stress that equals T . If the rotational strain a is known , the shear modulus G can be calculated as G 5 T / a ; a can be calculated as follows : a 5 cos 2 1 [ B r ( t ) / B 0 ] , where B 0 is the bead’s remnant magnetic ﬁeld in the horizontal direction immediately after magneti - zation and B r ( t ) is the bead’s remnant magnetic ﬁeld in the horizontal direction during twist . MTC measurements were made on ATII cells 1 ) to assess the ligand speciﬁcity ( RGD vs . BSA vs . acetylated LDL ) of bead binding ( n 5 12 ) , 2 ) to characterize changes in apparent cell stiffness as a function of contact time between cells and RGD - coated beads ( n 5 6 ) , 3 ) to measure stiffness of cells maintained in liquid culture for 2 – 9 days ( n 5 3 – 5 / time point ) , 4 ) to characterize the effects of cyclic deformation on cell mechanics ( n 5 11 ) , and 5 ) to assess the effects of the surfactant secretagogues ATP ( 100 m M , n 5 5 ) , terbutaline ( 100 m M , n 5 4 ) , and 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate ( TPA , 100 nM , n 5 4 ) on cell mechanics . Statistical methods . Values are means 6 SD . Statistical comparisons between experimental conditions were made using analysis of variance or the Student’s t - test for unpaired and , when appropriate , paired observations . Statistical sig - niﬁcance was assured at P , 0 . 05 with respect to a two - tailed probability distribution . 66 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF ALVEOLAR EPITHELIAL CELLS b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 6 on A ugu s t 27 , 2017 h tt p : / / j ap . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m RESULTS ATII cells spread and assume a type I cell morphol - ogy with time in culture . The average projected surface area of ATII cells increased from 206 m m 2 on day 2 to 1 , 073 m m 2 on day 5 and 811 m m 2 on day 12 ( Fig . 1 ) . ATII cells express an increasing number of ICAM - 1 and integrin receptors with time in culture . Figure 2 shows that adhesion receptor expression at the cell surface increased signiﬁcantly between days 1 and 4 . ICAM - 1 receptor expression increased 66 % during the ﬁrst 4 days in culture and remained relatively un - changed thereafter . Similar results had been observed previously and were attributed to a loss of type II cell characteristics in favor of type I characteristics ( 6 , 9 ) . Over the same time span , binding of dansylated RGD peptide at the cell surface increased by 73 % , indicative of increased integrin expression . ATII cells bind RGD - coated beads more avidly than they do albumin - or acetylated LDL - coated beads . Fig - ure 3 shows two MTC traces , one demonstrating the response of cell bound RGD - coated beads to applied stress and the other that of BSA - coated beads . Consid - ering that the remnant magnetic ﬁeld is inversely proportional to average bead rotation ( strain ) , two ob - servations are of note : 1 ) BSA - coated beads rotate further ( ; 90° in this example ) than RGD - coated beads when they are stressed ( arrow ) ; and 2 ) the remnant magnetic ﬁeld of RGD - coated beads partially recovers after stress removal ( at 80 s ) , whereas that of BSA - coated beads does not . For RGD - coated beads , this means that the deformed cell or , more speciﬁcally , its cytoskeleton exerts a force that reorients the beads in the direction of their prestressed baseline . However , the remnant ﬁeld is not fully restored , suggesting that the cytoskeleton has been permanently deformed . The fact that BSA - coated beads rotate more or less freely suggests that albumin , in contrast to RGD , is not bound to cytoskeleton - associated receptors . To further deﬁne the ligand speciﬁcity of MTC - based stiffness estimates , measurements were made using acetylated LDL - coated beads . This ligand binds to scavenger receptors that do not associate with the cytoskeleton ( 44 ) . The results mirrored those obtained with BSA - coated beads , i . e . , the derived stiffness val - ues were 50 – 75 % lower than when RGD - coated beads were used . Ligand - speciﬁc bead behavior implies that ATII cells in primary culture express apical integrin receptors that are capable of recruiting cytoskeleton proteins and form a FAC . Apparent stiffness of ATII cells increases with exter - nally applied stress . Figure 4 shows the average stress - strain relationships of ATII cells ( n 5 7 samples ) 5 – 6 days after harvest . Stiffness is deﬁned as the ratio of stress to strain , i . e . , the inverse of the slope of the lines that connect each point to the origin . Because the relationship is nonlinear , it follows that the cytoskele - ton stiffens when it is locally stressed . This behavior has been characterized as “strain hardening” ( 40 ) . Ac - cordingly , average cytoskeleton stiffness increased from 28 dyn / cm 2 at a stress of 11 dyn / cm 2 to 68 dyn / cm 2 at a stress of 59 dyn / cm 2 . Twisting cytometry measure - ments have yielded nonlinear stress - strain relation - ships in many other cell types , an observation often cited in support of tensegrity - based models of the cell architecture ( 21 , 39 ) . Apparent stiffness of ATII cells increases the longer the RGD - coated beads are in contact with the cell . Apparent stiffness increases the longer RGD - coated beads remain in contact with the cells . In Fig . 5 , ap - parent stiffness increased by 25 6 10 dyn / cm 2 over the Fig . 1 .

This observation is consistent with the ongoing recruitment of cytoskeletal elements to the focal adhesion sites between cells and beads . To ad - dress whether the time - dependent stiffening reﬂected a local reinforcement of bead binding consequent to repeated local deformations ( 5 ) , we varied the number of measurements ( twists ) independent of bead contact time . For example , some of the 90 - min data include measurements from wells that had been “twisted” only once , while others were twisted up to seven times starting at minute 30 . Multivariate analysis showed that the number of measurements per well was not an independent determinant of apparent stiffness . ATII cells become less deformable over time in cul - ture . Figure 6 shows the average stiffness results of ATII cells between 2 and 9 days in culture . Two differ - ent analytic models were used to compute apparent cell stiffness ; both yield qualitatively the same result , namely , ATII cells stiffen with time in culture . In the conventional model 1 , angular rotation is computed relative to the bead orientation before the application of a twisting force ( i . e . , relative to the 20 - s time point in Fig . 3 ) . Model 1 ignores permanent deformation and , therefore , yields lower apparent stiffness values . In model 2 , angular rotation is computed relative to the bead orientation after the application of a twisting force ( i . e . , relative to . 120 s in Fig . 3 ) . This model accounts for permanent deformation , insofar as only that part of the applied force that is stored in the cytoskeleton and responsible for the recoil of the beads to a new equilibrium position is considered in the stiffness calculation . Apparent stiffness of ATII cells decreases with re - peated deformation . Figure 7 shows a representative MTC tracing obtained from ATII cells with attached RGD - coated beads that were stressed at a rate of 10 cycles / min fo r 3 s at a time ( i . e . , at a duty cycle of 0 . 5 ) . After every 10 cycles ( once per minute ) , the magnetic moments of the beads were realigned in the direction of the magnetometer ( 10 - m s discharges of 1 , 000 gauss , arrows ) , in effect restoring the remnant magnetic ﬁeld to baseline . The twisting ﬁeld of 80 gauss produced an average stress of 137 6 3 dyn / cm 2 , which varied sys - tematically as a function of cycle and discharge num - ber ( see below ) . Figure 8 shows that the apparent stiffness of ATII cells fell by 16 6 14 % ( P , 0 . 001 ) in response to a 10 - min cyclic deformation at 0 . 3 Hz . A small , but highly signiﬁcant , fall in applied stress ( 0 . 9 6 0 . 64 dyn z cm 2 2 z min 2 1 , P , 0 . 01 ) was observed as well . The fall in applied stress is the consequence of permanent deformation accompanied by a gradual increase in the angular strain of the stressed beads . Recall that a bead with magnetic moment that is already aligned with the orthogonal twisting ﬁeld ( i . e . , 90° relative to the mag - netometer ) is not stressed by it . Therefore , as beads increasingly align themselves with the twisting ﬁeld , applied stress must fall . The reason for this alignment , Fig . 4 .

To ascertain that the fall in apparent stiffness with time and cumulative stress was not just a magnetic coil heating artifact , we also made standard stiffness mea - surements similar to those shown in Fig . 3 before and after exposure of the cells to cyclic deformation . During standard testing , the twisting ﬁeld is applied for a full 1 min as opposed to only 3 s , leaving no doubt that the system has reached an elastic equilibrium . Figure 9 shows the individual and mean paired results from 10 wells . In every instance , we observed a decline in apparent cell stiffness averaging 12 . 6 6 6 % below baseline ( P , 0 . 001 ) . Stress - induced decrease in apparent ATII cell stiff - ness reﬂects local cytoskeletal remodeling . Rose and colleagues ( 34 ) showed that surfactant secretion re - quires remodeling of the subcortical cytoskeleton , as evident by depolymerization of F - actin in favor of G - actin . Because ATII cells are mechanosensitive and secrete surfactant in response to mechanical stimuli ( 46 ) , it would seem reasonable to attribute the stress - related fall in apparent stiffness to this mechanism . For this hypothesis to be correct , we reasoned that secretagogues such as ATP , the b - agonist terbutaline , and phorbol ester should also cause a fall in apparent cell stiffness . The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig . 10 . Neither ATP , terbutaline , nor TPA had any signiﬁcant effects on the apparent stiff - ness of ATII cells . In light of this negative ﬁnding , we believe that local changes in the mechanical coupling between bead and cell ( bead slippage or yielding ) is a better explanation for the observed deformation re - sponse . DISCUSSION We have conﬁrmed that primary ATII cells acquire certain type I cell characteristics , such as a ﬂat shape and increased adhesion receptor expression , over time in culture ( 33 ) . We have shown 1 ) that ATII cells form much stronger attachments with RGD - coated beads than they do with BSA - or acetylated LDL - coated beads , 2 ) that these attachments seemingly “mature” during the ﬁrst 60 min of bead contact , 3 ) that the apparent stiffness of ATII cells increases , particularly between days 2 and 4 in culture , 4 ) that their stiffness falls when the RGD - coated beads are intermittently oscillated at 0 . 3 Hz , and 5 ) that this fall cannot be attributed to cytoskeletal remodeling associated with deformation - induced exocytosis . Before we discuss the biological implications of our ﬁndings , a discussion about MTC and the meaning of apparent cell stiffness is in order . MTC is a cell mechanics measurement technique that was introduced in its present form by Wang and colleagues in 1993 ( 44 ) . The technique rests on the observation that cells form an apical FAC with the beads so that bead rotation is impeded in some propor - tion to the cells’ resistance to a local shape change . Different mathematical analog models have been used to characterize the deformation resistance of cells and to compute apparent stiffness from bead torque and angular bead rotation ( 45 ) . There continues to be un - certainty about the extent to which MTC probes the mechanical properties of the cell at large or mostly reﬂects the strength of the local bead coupling . This debate is heavily intertwined with arguments about Fig . 8 . Change in apparent cell stiffness ( mean 6 SD ) associated with cyclic deformation at 0 . 3 Hz . ATII cells ( n 5 11 ) were grown to conﬂuence 4 – 9 days after harvest in culture . Fig . 9 .

There is evidence in sup - port of both sides of this argument . The observations that the apparent stiffness of ATII cells depends on the choice of ligand ( Fig . 3 ) and increases as a function of bead contact time ( Fig . 5 ) underscore the sensitivity of MTC on local bead adherence phenomena . On the other hand , the observations that bead manipulation at the cell surface can produce nuclear displacement and deformation ( 27 , 28 ) and that contractile agonists increase the apparent stiffness of adherent human airway smooth muscle cells ( 20 , 26 ) strongly argue in favor of some mechanical continuity between an apical FAC and more distant elements of the cytoskeleton . Interpreted in the context of our study , we believe that changes in apparent ATII cell stiffness cannot be at - tributed to local cytoskeletal remodeling to the exclu - sion of a more global change in cytoskeletal mechanics and vice versa . We will return to this point in the discussion of the biological implications of our results . For the most part , we chose to compute apparent stiffness without accounting for permanent deforma - tion . As can be readily appreciated from Fig . 3 , the remnant magnetic ﬁeld , and hence the orientation of beads , is not fully restored after the beads have been strained ( rotated ) . Although ignoring permanent defor - mation in the derivation of apparent stiffness biases the data toward low stiffness values , it does not bias temporal trends in cell mechanical properties . This is underscored in Fig . 6 , in which two analytic ap - proaches ( models 1 and 2 ) are directly compared and yield qualitatively similar information : cells become less deformable over time in culture . This is consistent with ﬁndings in other cell systems , indicating that permanent deformation varies in a relatively ﬁxed proportion with angular strain ( 3 ) . Permanent defor - mation and apparent cell stiffness estimates are also biased by heterogenous bead binding ( 12 ) . As pointed out by Fabry and colleagues ( 12 ) , the nonlinear rela - tionship between angular bead rotation ( a ) and the remnant magnetic ﬁeld ( B r ; see METHODS ) gives much greater weight to weakly bound beads , which undergo large rotations , than to ﬁrmly bound beads , the mag - netic moments of which remain closely aligned with the magnetometer . Hence , a change in apparent cell stiffness reﬂects a uniform change in the strength of apical bead binding , a shift in the distribution of bind - ing properties across different cells , or a more global change in cytoskeletal mechanics . The latter might reﬂect a change in cytoskeletal prestress that is ulti - mately driven by the activation of motor proteins , a change in the connectivity between cytoskeletal ele - ments , and / or a redistribution of loads carried by in - ternal as opposed to external load - bearing elements . ATII cells bind RGD - coated beads more avidly than they do albumin - coated beads . Many of the integrins share an afﬁnity to the RGD recognition sequence that can be found in many extracellular matrix proteins such as ﬁbronectin , laminin , and collagen ( 35 ) . It should come as no surprise that albumin - and acety - lated LDL - coated beads associated less avidly with ATII cells than beads coated with a matrix recognition sequence , namely , RGD ( 35 ) . Similar observations , namely ligand - speciﬁc stiffness estimates , have been made in other systems ( 3 , 44 ) . The difference in the mechanical interactions of the cell with RGD - as op - posed to BSA - coated beads would imply that ATII cells do not possess albumin receptors ( 36 ) and / or that al - bumin receptors do not strongly associate with the cytoskeleton . This is akin to the association of acety - lated LDL - coated beads and scavenger receptors ob - served in other cell systems ( 44 ) . Results of an albumin competition assay ( data not shown ) suggest that ATII cells have no albumin receptors . More importantly , the cell mechanical responses to RGD - coated beads sug - gest that ATII cells express apical integrins as early as 2 days after cell harvest in liquid culture . This inter - pretation of our MTC responses ( Fig . 3 ) is consistent with studies in which the expression of adhesion pro - teins by ATII cells in liquid culture have been charac - terized ( 6 , 24 ) and our own ﬁndings with ﬂuorescent - tagged RGD sequences ( Fig . 2 ) . ATII cells lose many type II features soon after cell harvest and begin ex - pressing type I characteristics , including ICAM - 1 , a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily ( 38 ) , and a V b 3 integrins . Accordingly , the adhesion of ATII cells to provisional matrix can be inhibited with synthetic RGD peptide ( 24 ) . Bonds between RGD - coated beads and ATII cells “mature” during the ﬁrst 60 min of bead contact . Figure 5 shows that ATII cells appear to stiffen during the ﬁrst 90 min of contact with RGD - coated beads . This observation suggests that the fraction of strongly bound beads increased over this time period , that FACs continued to mature and recruited additional cytoskeletal elements to the bead attachment site , and / or that the exposure to a provisional matrix over the apical cell surface caused a more widespread , global reorganization of the cytoskeleton . Magnetic as well as latex microbeads coated with ﬁbronectin or RGD peptide have been shown to induce local FAC formation as early as 15 min after bead application in virtually all cell systems studied ( 16 , 32 ) . FACs are mechanosensitive structures and are intimately in - volved in bidirectional integrin - mediated signaling ( 5 , 37 , 48 ) . Choquet and colleagues ( 5 ) observed that hu - man ﬁbroblasts “probe” the rigidity of their surround - ing matrix and that they modulate and adapt both strength and molecular composition of their adhesion sites accordingly . To examine whether deformation - induced FAC reinforcement played a part in the appar - ent stiffening response of ATII cells , we varied the number of “twists” ( i . e . , stiffness measurements ) inde - pendent of bead contact time . Because we could not demonstrate a mechanosensitive reinforcement effect , we speculate that either the cells were not strained long and often enough for reinforcement to take place or epithelial cells differ from mesenchymal cells in this respect . The localized application of matrix protein to the apical surface of baby hamster kidney cells has been shown to alter their adherence and spreading characteristics , implying a downstream effect on dis - 70 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF ALVEOLAR EPITHELIAL CELLS b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 6 on A ugu s t 27 , 2017 h tt p : / / j ap . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m tant ( basal ) adhesion mechanisms ( 7 ) . This observation is in keeping with a more global effect of RGD on cytoskeletal organization and possibly on cell pre - stress . Because there is considerable controversy about the nature of load - bearing elements and , hence , about the stress distribution within cells ( 18 , 22 ) , one must be careful in attributing changes in apparent cell stiffness to local remodeling as opposed to global changes in cytoskeletal tension . ATII cells become less deformable over time in cul - ture . It has been shown that ATII cells lose their type II characteristics and acquire those of type I cells when they are grown in vitro . We chose two previously de - scribed cell markers to demonstrate cell differentiation in our culture system : cell morphology and ICAM - 1 expression . Type II cells in vivo are cuboidal in shape , whereas type I cells appear more spread and ﬂat . Cell projection analysis revealed that ATII cells’ average area increased almost fourfold from days 2 to 12 in culture . In vivo ATII cells express minimal amounts of ICAM - 1 , as opposed to type I cells . In our system , freshly harvested ATII cells showed a small amount of ICAM - 1 expression , but by day 4 in culture this had increased by 66 % and remained mostly unchanged thereafter . We also discovered a novel ﬁnding , that integrin expression increases in ATII cells with time in culture as well . Figure 6 indicates that freshly harvested cells grown over 48 h in culture appear less stiff than conﬂuent monolayers ( day 4 in culture and beyond ) . Stabiliza - tion from cell - cell contact via E - cadherins and tight junctions had been demonstrated in other epithelial cell systems ( 3 ) . There are a number of additional likely reasons for the temporal change in ATII cell mechanical properties . In virtually all cell systems in which this has been evaluated , ﬂat , spread cells appear stiffer than round , cuboidal cells ( 20 , 21 , 45 ) . Although proponents of tensegrity as a model for understanding cell mechanical behavior predict a shape dependence of prestress and , therefore , of cell stiffness ( 39 ) , the ob - servation might simply reﬂect the proximity of the bead and its FAC to basal stress ﬁbers and / or FACs between cell and substratum . In a continuum mechan - ics analysis , this observation would be characterized as a boundary effect . Finally , the greater number of ad - hesion receptors , speciﬁcally integrins , at the surface of differentiating ATII cells might promote a more robust FAC formation and thereby strengthen the me - chanical coupling between cells and beads . Apparent stiffness of ATII cells decreases with re - peated deformation . The experiments summarized in Figs . 8 and 9 provide unequivocal evidence that a 10 - min application of an intermittent local stress at a frequency of 0 . 3 Hz reduces the apparent stiffness of ATII cells . In keeping with our view of MTC - derived mechanics indexes , we thought to relate the changes in apparent cell stiffness to evidence of local or global cytoskeletal remodeling . The observation reminded us that ATII cells are mechanosensitive , that is , ATII cells release surfactant in response to deformation ( 46 ) , and that surfactant exocytosis is associated with remodel - ing of the subcortical cytoskeleton ( 34 ) . Speciﬁcally , Rose and colleagues ( 34 ) showed in the same ATII cell culture model that the surfactant secretagogues ATP , TPA , and terbutaline induce subcortical actin depoly - merization , thereby facilitating vesicular transport to the plasma membrane . Although we were able to con - ﬁrm that TPA induces surfactant secretion ( data not shown ) as Rose and colleagues had done , we did not ﬁnd a corresponding change in cell mechanical proper - ties ( Fig . 10 ) . Indeed , none of the three pharmacologi - cal surfactant secretagogues produced a measurable change in apparent cell stiffness . This suggests that the measured stiffness might not reﬂect the stiffness of the subcortical F - actin network and that it is not pos - sible to attribute deformation - induced changes in ap - parent cell stiffness to cytoskeletal remodeling associ - ated with exocytosis . In a recent publication on human airway smooth muscle cells in culture , Maksym and colleagues ( 26 ) demonstrated relative stability in cell mechanical properties during the application of an oscillatory stress . However , our experiment on ATII cells differed from that of Maksym and colleagues in several impor - tant ways . They applied sinusoidal oscillations be - tween 0 . 05 and 0 . 5 Hz , whereas we rotated the beads in one direction and allowed them to recoil passively . Because of permanent deformation , beads would typi - cally recoil within 30 – 40° of their original orientation . We remagnetized the beads every minute to realign their magnetic moments with the magnetometer ( see arrows corresponding to discharges in Fig . 7 ) . As a result , a signiﬁcant fraction of beads underwent rota - tions in excess of 360° from their original orientation over the course of a 10 - min experiment . We put forth the hypothesis that such large angular rotations rela - tive to baseline ( time 0 ) promote FAC remodeling and bead slippage . From scanning electron microscopy im - aging , we know that on average only the basal aspect of a bead is in contact with the apex of the cell ( data not shown ) . Consequently , the application of a twisting torque brings unoccupied RGD molecules of the free bead surface in contact with integrins that reside in the plasma membrane , while at the same time lifting and pulling the FAC attached to the bead base out of the plane with the original cell border . As a result , we speculate that beads continuously formed new FACs over their free surface while resolving “more mature FACs” originally situated at the bead base . Given the observations of Fig . 5 that suggested to us that new FACs are “weaker” than established FACs , we postu - late that strain - induced bead slippage accounts for the fall in apparent stiffness of ATII cells in our experi - ment . Biological implications and concluding remarks . We set out to characterize the mechanical properties of a popular culture model of the distal air space . Our motivation was our interest in ventilator - induced lung injury and thus the biological responses of this model to deformation . We had recently shown that primary rat ATII cells release tumor necrosis factor - a when intermittently strained ( 31 ) and speculated that non - 71 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF ALVEOLAR EPITHELIAL CELLS b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 6 on A ugu s t 27 , 2017 h tt p : / / j ap . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m lethal plasma membrane wounding ( plasma mem - brane stress failure ) is an important mechanotrans - duction event for the upregulation of proinﬂammatory genes ( 42 ) . It would stand to reason that the probabil - ity of plasma membrane wounding is in some way related to the cells’ resistance to a shape change , which we now know changes with time , shape , and differen - tiation of these cells in culture . Consistent with these ideas , Tschumperlin and Margulies ( 41 ) reported that recently harvested ATII cells are more likely to take up ethidium homodimer ( a marker of membrane integ - rity ) in response to a stretch than cells that had grown to conﬂuence for 5 days in culture . Because for a given substratum strain the load on force - bearing elements of the cell varies with the cell’s resistance to shape change , we postulate that the changes in apparent ATII cell mechanical properties will scale with other deformation responses , such as lipid trafﬁcking and cytokine release , as well . Although the mechanisms of force transfer between basement membrane , cytoskel - eton , and plasma membrane of ATII cells remain to be resolved , such analyses undoubtedly require deﬁnition of the cell’s mechanical properties . To our knowledge , the results presented here provide the ﬁrst data on this topic . The authors thank B . J . Walters and P . J . Zollman for technical support and L . L .
