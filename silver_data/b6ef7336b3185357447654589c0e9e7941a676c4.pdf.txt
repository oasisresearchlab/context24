Briggs 1 Introduction Teams use ideation ( brainstorming ) techniques to generate alternatives in response to a crisis or opportunity with the goal of converging on a few high quality ideas . Consequently , much research has been conducted to develop and enhance techniques for group idea generation ( see e . g . Diehl and Stroebe 1987 ; Dennis and Valacich 1993 ; Fjermestad and Hiltz 1999 ) . Ideation research , however , tends to focus on developing techniques that generate a larger number of ideas , sometimes with little attention to idea quality . The link between quantity and quality can be traced back to Alex Osborn , an advertising executive and creativity expert who developed the original brainstorming protocol . Osborn ( 1963 ) suggested that the more ideas a group produced the more good ideas it would produce and that this could best be accomplished by refraining from criticism , generating wild ideas , building on the ideas of others , and contribut - ing as many ideas as possible . Several subsequent studies demonstrated a correlation between idea quantity and idea quality ( e . g . Diehl and Stroebe 1987 ; Dennis et al . 1990 ; Gallupe et al . 1992 ; Valacich et al . 1994 ) . Given that the measurement of idea quality can be onerous and expensive , some authors argued that the existing empiri - cal evidence of a quantity – quality link obviated the need for measuring idea quality ( e . g . Diehl and Stroebe 1987 ) . Citing this conclusion , some authors stopped measuring the quality of the ideas produced by new brainstorming techniques . Subsequent research , however , calls the quantity – quality conjecture into question by demonstrating conditions under which idea quantity does not correlate with idea quality ( e . g . Baruah and Paulus 2008 ; Connolly et al . 1990 ; Reinig et al . 2007 ) . Thus , Osborn’s quantity – quality conjecture may not generalize to all situations . Practitioners do not want more ideas ; they want a few high quality ideas . We have worked with hundreds of professional groups in the ﬁeld and in no case has a manager sought a high quantity of ideas except when they believed that doing so would ultimately yield a greater number of high quality ideas . There appears to be a fundamental misalignment with the most common outcome variable of ideation research ( quantity ) and the real world goal of teams working to generate ideas ( quality ) . Bounded Ideation Theory ( BIT ) suggests a way to link the existing literature on idea quantity to the outcome - of - interest , ideation quality . Generating good ideas is a high cognitive load task , and BIT proposes a cognitive foundation for linking quantity and quality during ideation ( Briggs and Reinig 2010 ) . BIT deﬁnes ideation quality as the degree to which a collection of ideas generated by a group is instrumental in advancing the group toward its goals ( Briggs and Reinig 2010 ) . Ideation quality is related to , but different than idea quality , in that idea quality is a property of a single idea , while ideation quality is a property of a set of ideas . Ideation quality is typically measured by ﬁrst identifying the unique ideas generated during an ideation session , then evaluating each individual idea along some quality dimension related to the goal of ideation session and then aggregating the individual scores in some meaningful way such as taking their sum or average . Measures of ideation quality provide a basis for comparing the relative merits of ideation techniques and / or technologies . BIT posits six mechanisms that impose boundaries on ideation quality , and so inﬂu - ence the ratio of good ideas to total ideas . The theory suggests conditions under which 123 Putting Quality First in Ideation Research 945 the quantity – quality relationship conjectured by Osborn should hold , and conditions under which it should not , and so may account for the disparity among ﬁndings in the literature , and may provide new insights for techniques to produce better solutions for important problems . In this paper , we summarize the logic of BIT . We then examine studies published in three outlets for group ideation to determine which of the boundaries have been addressed by existing literature , and what inferences can be drawn from this literature about the relationship between idea quantity and idea quality . We identify ﬁve classes of dependent variables reported in the literature for measuring ideation quality . We develop logic to argue that four of the ﬁve classes of dependent variables are inherently biased , and develop a simulation to demonstrate conditions under which the four measures would diverge , yielding ﬂawed inferences about empirical ﬁndings . We discuss the implications of this work for research and practice , and propose new directions for a research stream on idea quality . 2 Bounded Ideation Theory BoundedIdeationTheorypredictsandexplainstheslopeofan ideationfunction , which is an ogive that plots the cumulative number of good ideas against the cumulative number of total ideas ( Reinig and Briggs 2008 ) . An idea may be considered a good idea to the extent that it helps a group move toward achieving its goals . In the context of organizational problem solving , for example , a good idea might be a solution that is feasible to implement and eliminates unacceptable conditions without creating new problems ( Reinig and Briggs 2008 ) . An idea may be considered a bad idea to the extent that it does not help a group move toward achieving its goals . For example , a bad idea might be a solution that is not feasible , fails to alleviate unacceptable conditions or creates new problems . If all the ideas contributed by a group were good ideas , then the ideation function would be a line with a slope of 1 . If a group were to contribute a steady mix of good and bad ideas , however , then the slope would be less than one . If all ideas contributed by a group were bad ideas , then the ideation function would be a line with a slope of 0 . BIT proposes that the quantity – quality relationship is limited by six boundaries that prevent a perfect ideation function from emerging—participants’ cognitive ability , understanding of the problem , scarcity of attention resources , mental and physical exhaustion , goal congruence , and the openness of a solution space ( Briggs and Reinig 2010 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . 2 . 1 The Ability Boundary BIT proposes a primary causal relationship between participants’ cognitive ability and ideation quality . Ability is a function of both intelligence ( a measure of an individ - ual’s capacity to learn , reason , and recognize patterns ) , and relevant domain expertise . The more intelligent individuals are , the better able they are to generate good ideas . The greater their domain expertise , the more knowledge they may have of relevant professional , social and political dimensions of a task , and the more elaborate will 123 946 B . A . Reinig , R . O . Briggs Fig . 1 The propositions of Bounded Ideation Theory ( Briggs and Reinig 2010 ) be their cognitive schema , which reduces cognitive load of reasoning about solutions ( Baddeley 1990 ) . Experts deploy their knowledge in larger chunks , which lets them bring more relevant knowledge to bear on the task at one time , giving them a greater ability to generate good ideas than that of novices , whose knowledge is more frag - mented . High - ability individuals would be expected to generate a greater number of high - quality ideas than would individuals of low ability , and so produce a higher ratio of good - ideas to total ideas . 2 . 2 The Attention Boundary Because human attention is limited , people cannot think about all of the concepts in their long - term memories simultaneously . They must therefore follow a train of thought , moving from one concept to other related concepts as they think and reason . Lacking additional external stimuli to activate a new part of their knowledge network , people tend to think inside the box , a condition called cognitive inertia ( Mackay and Mckiernan 2006 ) that causes people to focus on a few topics or themes ( Dennis et al . 1997 ) . Cognitive inertia may cause people to contribute fewer and fewer good ideas as time passes . The Attention Boundary moderates the Ability Relationship because , regardless of ability , people can only generate good ideas to the extent that they can commit their attention to the task , and bring knowledge to bear on generating solutions . Thus , an attention boundary may reduce the ratio of good - ideas to total - ideas . 2 . 3 The Exhaustion Boundary The limits of human mental and physical endurance may also affect idea quality . Peo - ple tire as they work . As mental abilities become fatigued it becomes more difﬁcult to formulate good ideas , and so the frequency of good ideas may decline . The Exhaustion 123 Putting Quality First in Ideation Research 947 Boundary moderates the relationship between idea quantity and quality because , regardless of their level of ability , individuals can only generate and contribute good ideas to the limits of their physical and mental stamina . Thus , as people experience exhaustion , they are less able to bring their cognitive resources to bear on generating good ideas , and consequently the ratio of good - ideas to total - ideas would decrease . 2 . 4 The Understanding Boundary Individuals of high ability may nonetheless struggle to generate good ideas when the problem itself is ill - deﬁned or misunderstood . When starting to work on complex , real - world problems , people may begin with an awareness only of symptoms but little understanding of underlying causes . They may , therefore , begin by proposing solutions that would mitigate symptoms , but exacerbate the underlying problem , causing them to create less - than - useful ideas . As they gain insight and information about the problem , the quality of their ideas may increase . Thus , we would expect the ratio of good - ideas to total - ideas to increase as understanding improves . 2 . 5 The Goal Congruence Boundary Goal congruence is the degree to which an individual perceives that working toward a group goal would be instrumental toward attaining their private goals . A lack of goal congruence could , for example , give rise to free - riding , reducing the level of effort an individual is willing to spend to generate good ideas . Evaluation apprehension—a fear that contributing an unpopular idea could result in retribution by peers or superiors— could affect the degree to which individuals are willing to contribute good ideas to the group , once they are generated . Free - riding and evaluation apprehension are also examples of goal congruence issues . Extreme negative goal congruence could lead to individuals knowingly suggesting bad ideas in an effort to thwart attainment of the group goal . 2 . 6 The Solution Space Boundary The solution space for a problem - solving tasks falls on a continuum from open - ended to closed - ended . Open - ended tasks are those for which an unlimited number of solu - tions or alternatives are possible , like deriving new product concepts or selecting a title for a ﬁctional book . Closed - ended tasks are those for which only a ﬁnite number of workable solutions or alternatives are possible , like selecting a vendor or identify - ing the cause of a mechanical failure ( Briggs and Reinig 2010 ) . With a closed - ended task , once all good ideas have been contributed , any further contributions would , of necessity , be low - quality ideas . The Solution Space Boundary moderates the Ability Relationship because , regardless of their ability , people can only generate good ideas to the extent that it would be possible to generate more good ideas than have already been contributed . 123 948 B .

Briggs 3 Analysis of Ideation Literature We drew on the propositions of BIT to analyze ideation studies from the past 15 years in three leading outlets for ideation research , including Group Decision and Negotiation ( GDN ) , Small Group Research ( SGR ) , and Organizational Behavior and Human Deci - sion Processes ( OBHDP ) . GDN , SGR , and OBHDP were selected because they are leading academic journals on the subject of group work . Papers that addressed ideation productivitywithdirectmeasuresofideationproductivitysuchasideacount , ideaqual - ity , or idea creativity were included in the analysis . Findings other than those direct measures of observable ideation productivity were not included . We limited the search to the 15 most recent years , to allow a reasonable tradeoff between breadth and depth of analysis . This yielded a set of 20 papers . We analyze the treatments of each study to determine which of the boundaries of BIT each treatment invoked , so as to aggregate studies with common theoretical foundations . Some studies manipulated only one boundary ; some manipulated more than one boundary . We analyzed the dependent variables for each study to classify them by the approach they took to calculating ideation quality . We reﬂect on the degree to which papers pertaining to each BIT boundary could be useful for drawing inferences with respect to a relationship between idea quantity and ideation quality . 3 . 1 Attention Boundary Research In the 11 studies listed in Table 1 , researchers use a variety of technologies and facili - tation techniques to manipulate the attention boundary . This section summarizes their treatments , metrics , and ﬁndings , and analyzes the degree to which inferences about ideation quality could be drawn from this body of work . Ferreira et al . ( 2011 ) developed the AB Tool , an electronic ideation system that would not display new ideas from other people to a user who was currently typing his or her own ideas , to reduce attention demands during brainstorming . Groups using the AB Tool generated more ideas than non - supported groups . Benbasat and Lim ( 2000 ) used an electronic brainstorming system ( EBS ) designed to reduce an availability bias , and reported that EBS groups outperformed verbal baseline groups in terms of number of solutions generated . Kramer et al . ( 2001 ) , on the other hand , used facilitators to manipulate group struc - ture , focus , and stimulation . They also compared outcomes across two kinds of idea— recording technologies ( computer - assisted and ﬂip chart ) . Overall , facilitated groups generated more ideas than non - facilitated groups but not signiﬁcantly more ideas than nominal groups . In a nominal group each participant makes their own list of ideas , after which the lists are collected and aggregated ( Diehl and Stroebe 1987 ) . There was no difference by recording technology . Martz and Shepherd ( 2004 ) contrasted the number of comments and the number of integrative comments a group made across two treatments : ( 1 ) a single - channel electronic brainstorm ( all users contributed to a shared electronic page ) ; and ( 2 ) a multi - channel brainstorm ( all users startedonadifferent electronicpage , andjumpedat random to a different page after each comment ) . Integrative comments were those that 123 Putting Quality First in Ideation Research 949 T a b l e 1 I d ea ti on s t ud i e s t h a t t a r g e t t h e a tt e n ti on bound a r y A r ti c l e P h e no m e non o f s t udy DV c l a ss M a n i pu l a ti on / i nv e s ti g a ti on F i nd i ng s B a r u a h a nd P a u l u s ( 2008 ) N u m b e r o f r ec o mm e nd a ti on s f o r i m p r ov i ng t h e un i v e r s it y I C , AQ T ec hn i qu e t r a i n i ng v e r s u s no t ec hn i qu e t r a i n i ng T r a i n e d - p a r ti c i p a n t s p r odu ce d m o r e i d ea s o f h i gh e r a v e r a g e o r i g i n a lit y O r i g i n a lit y ( c r ea ti v it y , r a r it y ) o f r ec o mm e nd a ti on s B r a i n s t o r m - s o l o - b e f o r e - g r oup - b r a i n s t o r m v e r s u s b r a i n s t o r m - w it h - g r oup - b e f o r e - s o l o - b r a i n s t o r m P a r ti c i p a n t s w h o b r a i n s t o r m e d a l on e b e f o r e w o r k i ng w it h t h e g r oup p r odu ce d a g r ea t e r nu m b e r o f i d ea s B e nb a s a t a nd L i m ( 2000 ) N u m b e r o f s o l u ti on s g e n e r a t e d I C E B S t o r e du ce a v a il a b ilit y b i a s E B S s uppo r t e d g r oup s g e n e r a t e d m o r e i d ea s t h a n b a s e li n e g r oup s .

The study showed no difference in the number of comments users contributed , but showed that single - channel users contributed signiﬁcantly more integrative statements than did multichannel users . Kerr and Murthy ( 2004 ) studied the number of ideas a group produced and the percentage of irrelevant ideas the group produced in a 2 × 2 design that crossed chat tool versus paper - and - pen with divergent task versus convergent task . The study found that chat tool users produced more ideas in the divergent task , but more irrelevant ideas in the convergent task than did groups using conventional methods . Several studies used facilitation techniques to break people out of cognitive inertia so as to promote creativity . Paulus and Yang ( 2000 ) , for example , implemented a pen and paper technique to share ideas among group members so that the ideas of others could stimulate the production of new ideas . Choi and Thompson ( 2005 ) rotated participants from group to group and found that these so - called open groups generated more ideas than did closed or invariant groups . Baruah and Paulus ( 2008 ) manipulated the attention boundary by training some par - ticipants to use two techniques that could break cognitive inertia : problem decomposi - tion ( breakingtheproblemintoconstituentparts ) , andproblemconstruction ( reframing the problem in terms of multiple goals ) . They divided the brainstorming task into two sessions : One part where participants brainstormed alone , the other part where they brainstormed together . Participants who learned and used the techniques produced ideas of higher average originality than did untrained participants . Participants who brainstormed alone before working with the group produced a larger number of ideas than did people who brainstormed ﬁrst with the group , then alone . Coskun ( 2005 ) reported two studies that attempted to manipulate the attention boundary by breaking cognitive inertia . The ﬁrst study interrupted a brainstorming session about improving a university with either a divergent or a convergent thinking exercise . The divergent exercise required participants to identify as many differences as possible between pairs of concepts , while the convergent required them to identify as many similarities as possible . Groups produced more recommendations per minute in the ﬁrst session than in the second session . People who did the divergent exercise produced a greater number of non - repetitive recommendations in the second session than did those who executed the convergent exercise . The second study also used an interrupted brainstorming session in a 2 × 2 × 2 design . In Treatment 1 , partici - pants executed a divergent thinking task before brainstorming began and a convergent 123 954 B . A . Reinig , R . O . Briggs thinking task during the interruption . Treatment 2 reversed the order . These treatments were crossed with nominal groups versus interactive groups and ﬁrst session versus second session . As in Study 1 , the people in Study 2 generated more ideas in the ﬁrst session than in the second session . For the ﬁrst session , there was no effect by sequence - of - exercise or by brainstorming technique , nor an interaction effect . In the second session , people who had the convergent - divergent treatment generated more ideas than those with the reverse . There was no effect by brainstorming technique . McGlynn et al . ( 2004 ) examined both the quality and quantity of ideas on a task where participants executed a two - part brainstorming session interrupted by a mental exercise . During the session participants were shown a sequence of playing cards , and were asked to hypothesize about the sequencing rule after each card was revealed . The 2 × 2 design crossed early - session versus late - session with nominal group tech - nique versus Osborn’s technique . Nominal groups generated more hypotheses than did brainstorming groups , and the early sessions produced more hypotheses than did the later sessions . There were no interaction effects . However , early sessions lasted twice as long as later sessions . Nominal groups and early sessions also produced a greater number of plausible hypotheses , but the nominal group effect was larger in the early sessions than in the later . Early sessions produced a higher proportion of plausible hypotheses than did later groups , but there was no difference in proportion of plau - sible hypotheses by technique . Brainstorming groups in the early session produced signiﬁcantly more correct hypotheses than did other groups . Porath and Erez ( 2009 ) posited that negative affect would interfere with cognitive ability , and so interfere with ideation productivity . They manipulated negative affect in a 2 × 2 × 2 study that crossed ( a ) unjustiﬁable rudeness toward a confederate versus no rudeness ; by ( b ) rude peer versus rude leader ; by ( c ) cooperative situation versus competitive situation . Overall , people who witnessed unjustiﬁable rudeness toward another reported more negative affect , and negative affect was associated with fewer ideas of a lower average quality . When witnessing rudeness , however , people in the competitive condition reported less negative affect and produced a correspondingly greater number of ideas of higher quality than did people in the cooperative condition . Controlling for negative affect , the rudeness effect disappeared . Of the 11 studies , all included an idea - count measure . Four studies also included some measure of idea quality ( e . g . usefulness , originality , novelty , creativity , plausibil - ity , correctness ) ; some reported more than one measure of quality . Of those presenting an ideation quality measure , two papers reported an average - quality ( Baruah and Paulus 2008 ; Porath and Erez 2009 ) approach to calculating ideation quality , com - puting the mean of the quality scores of the ideas generated in an ideation session . Two papers reported a Good - idea - proportion score ( Kerr and Murthy 2004 ; McGlynn et al . 2004 ) , calculated by counting the number of ideas with quality scores exceeding a certain threshold ( typically midpoint or higher ) and dividing by the number of unique ideas generated in an ideation session . Finally , McGlynn et al . ( 2004 ) also reported a Good - idea - count , by counting the number of ideas generated in an ideation session that exceed a certain threshold ( typically midpoint or higher ) . Some the studies that measured quality either did not report how quality was mea - sured or used weak indicators of the construct . One study , for example , deemed an idea to be high - quality to the extent that it was both creative and original ( not con - 123 Putting Quality First in Ideation Research 955 tributed by a large number of participants ) ( Baruah and Paulus 2008 ) . The paper did not deﬁne the term , creative , however , or report the rubric used to judge creativity . It is also possible for participants to contribute bad ideas that are rare , so the useful - ness of the originality construct as an indicator of ideation quality is limited . Another study counted an idea as good quality to the extent that it was relevant to the problem ( Kerr and Murthy 2004 ) . It is possible , though , for an idea to be relevant , and yet ineffective or infeasible , so the usefulness of relevance as an indicator of idea quality is in question . In sum , researchers addressed the attention boundary in potentially meaningful ways , using technological and process interventions to stimulate creativity , break cognitive inertia and optimize the use of attention resources . Only one of eleven papers , however , reportedclearevidenceofanassociationbetweenquantityandquality ( i . e . Porath and Erez 2009 ) . 3 . 2 Goal Congruence Boundary Research Several of the studies manipulated the goal congruence boundary ( Table 2 ) . Shantz and Latham ( 2009 ) , for example , explored whether supraliminal priming could induce a subconscious need for achievement , and so improve brainstorming performance . In the ﬁrst treatment , participants viewed a large photo of a female runner winning a race . In the second , participants viewed a collage of smaller photos of famous athletes from several sports . A control group viewed no photos . Participants who viewed the large photo of the runner produced a signiﬁcantly larger number of uses for a coat hanger than did participants in other treatments . The authors speculated that the collage of famous athletes may have distracted participants from the ideation task ( an attention boundary effect ) . Besides proposing that negative affect might consume cognitive resources ( see Sect . 2 . 2 ) , Porath and Erez ( 2009 ) posited that people who observe unwarranted rude - ness by a leader toward another participant might be less inclined to work toward a group goal because the rudeness event might prime new private goals such as inﬂict - ing retribution on the rude leader and protecting themselves from rudeness . People who witnessed rude treatment of another did indeed produce fewer ideas with a lower average quality . The nature of the study , however , did not permit the separation of goal congruence effects from attention boundary effects . Ideation productivity might be inhibited by evaluation apprehension , a goal con - gruence issue related to fear of retribution from peers or superiors for submitting an unpopular idea ( Diehl and Stroebe 1987 ) . Researchers have used group support sys - tem ( GSS ) to manipulate anonymity during ideation in an effort to reduce evaluation apprehension . McLeod ( 2011 ) reported more unique ideas from anonymous groups , but found no difference in the quality by treatment . Barki and Pinsonneault ( 2001 ) found no signiﬁcant difference between anonymous and identiﬁed brainstorming for sum - of - quality , average - quality , or good - idea - count . Cooper et al . ( 1998 ) reported that both anonymous GSS and nominal groups generated more ideas than did identiﬁed GSS users , and that anonymous GSS groups produced a greater number of controver - sial ideas than did other treatments , such as “tattoo AIDS victims to ID them , ” ( Cooper 123 956 B . A . Reinig , R . O . Briggs et al . 1998 , p . 160 ) . It was not the goal of the brainstorming session to generate con - troversial ideas , however , so controversial - idea - count could not be interpreted as an indicator of ideation quality . Baruah and Paulus ( 2008 ) addressed evaluation apprehension in another way : train - ing groups not to make critical comments about one another’s contributions , and by providing a mechanism whereby they could be held accountable by the group for poor performance . Trained groups produced ideas of higher average originality than did untrained groups . However , the study design did not allow for the separation of goal congruence effects from attention boundary and ability boundary effects that may also have resulted from the treatments . Gagné and Zuckerman ( 1999 ) manipulated evaluation potential to reduce social loaﬁng , and found that groups in the high - evaluation - potential treatment produced a greater number of ideas . Similarly , McLeod ( 2011 ) reported that comparison groups generated more ideas than non - comparison groups . However , there was no difference in mean quality of ideas by treatment . Of the seven papers in the cluster related to goal congruence , six reported idea - count measures . Four papers reported average - quality measures of ideation quality ( origi - nality , feasibility , effectiveness , creativity ) . One study , Barki and Pinsonneault ( 2001 ) also reported sum - of - quality , and good - idea count measures , but did not report idea - count measures . Of the four papers reporting quality metrics , two reported differences in ideation quality , and two did not . Three papers reported both quality and quantity measures . In one of those studies , idea quality was related to idea quantity ( i . e . , Porath and Erez 2009 ) . In two studies , measures of quantity and quality did not converge to the same research conclusion ( i . e . , McLeod 2011 ; Baruah and Paulus 2008 ) . Most of the goal congruence manipu - lations increased the number of ideas a group contributed . Anonymity was shown in multiple studies to increase the number of ideas generated . In sum , researchers addressed the goal congruence boundary in ways that produced observable effects , using facilitation techniques , training approaches , technological interventions , social cues , and supraliminal priming to overcome evaluation appre - hensions . Only one of seven papers , however , reported an association between idea quantity and ideation quality . 3 . 3 Understanding Boundary Research Twostudiestestedinterventionswithapotentialtoaddresstheunderstandingboundary ( Table 3 ) . Barki and Pinsonneault ( 2001 ) provided participants a list of contextual cues or seeded ideas to illustrate different idea types for a given problem . These seedings yielded an increase in the number of ideas a group produced , but did not produce signiﬁcant ﬁndings for ideation quality , ( unlike other treatments reported in the same paper that were focused on the goal congruence boundary ) . Baruah and Paulus ( 2008 ) conducted a treatment where some participants brain - stormed alone before brainstorming with a group , while others ﬁrst brainstormed with the group before brainstorming alone . People who brainstormed alone before working with the group produced a greater number of ideas , but there was no effect for orig - 123 Putting Quality First in Ideation Research 957 Table 3 Ideation studies that target the understanding boundary Article Phenomenon of study DV class Manipulation / investigation Findings Barki and Pinsonneault ( 2001 ) Total quality , mean quality , and number of good ideas SQAQ Stimulation with contextual cues ( seeded ) versus non - seeded discussion across four technology treatments : verbal brainstorming , nominalbrainstorming , EBS - anonymous , EBS - identiﬁed Seeding interacted with technology for idea - quantity Topic sensitivity No main effects and no sig . on mean or total quality Baruah and Paulus ( 2008 ) Number of recommendationsforimprovingtheuniversity IC , AQ Brainstorm - solo - before - group - brainstorm versus Brainstorm - with - group - before - solo - brainstorm People who brainstormed solo before group brainstormingproducedmorerecommendations Originality ( creativity , rarity ) of recommendations No originality effect IC idea - count , SQ sum - of - quality , AQ average quality , GIP good - idea - proportion , GIC good - idea - count inality . It is possible that , during the time people brainstormed alone before working with the group , they had uninterrupted time to make sense of the problem and some parts of the solution space . People who brainstormed with the group may not have had as much opportunity to reﬂect on the problem before becoming focused on solutions . The study , however , was not designed to separate understanding boundary effects from potential attention boundary and ability boundary effects . In sum , researchers manipulated the understanding boundaries with information cues , collaboration technologies , and collaboration techniques . Both papers reported idea - counts , and both papers reported average - quality measures . Both papers reported increases in the number of ideas that a group produced , but neither demonstrated an effect for quality . Neither paper demonstrated an empirical relationship between idea quantity and ideation quality . 3 . 4 Ability Boundary Research Researchers addressed the ability boundary by providing ideation training to par - ticipants to improve their ability or by exploring differences in individual traits to determine which are associated with superior ideation ( Table 4 ) . Kramer et al . ( 2001 ) provided videotaped training to treatment groups prior to ideation . One treatment pro - videdpositiveexamplesofideationbehaviorandtheotherprovidednegativeexamples . 123 958 B . A . Reinig , R . O . Briggs Groups receiving these training treatments , however , did not produce more ideas than groups who did not receive training . Baruah and Paulus ( 2008 ) conducted a more extensive 2 - h training regimen including tips on increasing the diversity of ideas in the set , Osborn’s rules and other rules for improving brainstorming , a video show with feedback , tips on attention and unique ideas , accountability , and three 10 - min practice sessions . Groups with training produced more ideas than groups with no training . The design of the study , however , did not support separating ability effects from under - standing boundary and goal congruence effects that could also have resulted from the treatments . Jung et al . ( 2012 ) used a psychometric instrument to isolate introverts and extraverts and compared their ideation productivity in computer mediated and nominal groups . They reported that extraverts generated more unique ideas and more diverse ideas than did introverts . They also noted in a second experiment that extraverts outperformed introverts under conditions of medium to high stimulation ( Jung et al . 2012 ) . Goncalo and Staw ( 2006 ) primed individualistic states with questions focused on individual traitsandprimedcollectiviststateswithstatementsfocusingaboutgroupmemberships . This individualistic versus collectivistic treatment was then crossed with a goal of either being practical or creative . There were no main effects for the individualistic versus collectivistic treatment but there was an interaction such that individualistic groups with a creative goal produced more ideas and ideas of higher average quality than did other groups . There was a main effect for the proportion of good ideas with respect to the goal of being creative . Chirumbolo et al . ( 2005 ) compared the ideation productivity of people with a high need for closure to those with a low need for closure . Groups generated advertising slogans , and then selected their best four as a ﬁnal set . People with a low need for closure produced more slogans of higher creativity . Their ﬁnal sets were judged to be of higher creativity , and were judged to have built more on ideas proposed earlier in the session . Miura and Hida ( 2004 ) also reported ﬁndings consistent with the ability boundary . They analyzed group diversity by comparing the number of categories required to classify the unique ideas each group produced . Groups that required more categories to classify their unique ideas were deemed to more diverse . High diverse groups tended to generate more unique and more good ideas than low diversity groups . Fur - ther , groups that generated many ideas in each category produced more unique ideas and more good ideas than groups generating fewer ideas within each category . The standard for measuring idea quality , however , was relatively low requiring only that an idea be rated above the mean on one of three dimensions of creativity . In sum , researchers manipulated the ability boundary with training , technique , and goalsettinginterventions . Theyexploredthreeinnatepersonalitytraitsthatcouldaffect one’s ability to ideate : need - for - closure , individualism , and introversion . Of the six papers pertaining to the ability boundary , all six papers reported an idea - count measure . Four of the six reported idea quality metrics . Of those , three reported average - quality , one reported good - idea - count , and one reported good - idea - proportion . All four papers that reported measures of ideation quality reported at least one quality effect . Goncalo and Staw ( 2006 ) reported two measures of quality—average - quality and good - idea - proportion . However , those measures did not converge with each other—where there was an effect for one metric , there was no effect for the other .

In the other two studies , measures of idea quantity and idea quality failed to converge to the same research conclusion . Overall , only two of six studies yielded evidence of a relationship between idea quantity and ideation quality . 3 . 5 Exhaustion and Solution Space Boundaries None of the studies we examined explicitly manipulated or explored the solution space boundary . Itispossible , however , thatthesolutionspaceboundaryhadaneffectinsome of the research . Johnson et al . ( 2003 ) for example , used a competitive sports scenario ( handball ) in which participants were to quickly state their options or responses to a situation . Although 107 unique options were generated many were closely related and were distilled down to nine categories such as “shoot” or “pass to front left” . They found that the ﬁrst option chosen was , on average , the best option generated and that the quality of options diminished serially . A closed solution - space could account for these ﬁndings . This is not evidence , however , that a “ﬁrst choice is best” strategy would be effective under all conditions . 3 . 6 Summary of Literature Review Findings The ideation literature analyzed here used a rich variety of tools and techniques to manipulate or explore the attention , goal - congruence , understanding , and ability boundaries . Four of the papers reported manipulations of multiple boundaries . None of the papers manipulated the exhaustion boundary or the solution space boundary . Table 5 summarizes key ﬁndings of the literature analysis . The literature analysis revealed evidence that the ideation interventions under study could increase the number of ideas a group could produce . Of the twenty papers analyzed , 19 reported at least one measure of idea quantity and 18 of those indicated 123 Putting Quality First in Ideation Research 961 T a b l e 5 S u mm a r y o f lit e r a t u r e r e v i e w ﬁ nd i ng s B ound a r y N u m b e r o f p a p e r s R e po r t qu a lit y R e po r t qu a lit y a nd qu a n tit y m ea s u r e s M ea s u r e s o f qu a lit y a nd qu a n tit y c onv e r g e M ea s u r e s o f i d ea ti on qu a lit y I C S Q AQ G I P G I C (cid:2) S i g (cid:2) S i g (cid:2) S i g (cid:2) S i g (cid:2) S i g A tt e n ti on 11 4 4 0 11 9 0 0 2 1 2 2 1 1 G o a l c ong r u e n ce 7 4 3 0 6 5 1 0 4 2 0 0 1 0 U nd e r s t a nd i ng 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 A b ilit y 6 4 4 1 6 6 0 0 3 3 1 1 1 1 T o t a l 20 13 8 2 19 18 1 0 6 3 3 3 3 2 N u m b e r s o f p a p e r s t h a t : ( a ) e x a m i n e eac h bound a r y ; ( b ) r e po r t bo t h i d ea qu a n tit y a nd i d ea qu a lit y m ea s u r e s o f i d ea qu a lit y ; ( c ) r e po r t qu a lit y a nd qu a n tit y s c o r e s t h a t c onv e r g e t o t h e s a m e r e s ea r c h c on c l u s i on ; ( d ) r e po r t eac h m ea s u r e o f i d ea ti on qu a lit y ; ( e ) r e po r t s i gn i ﬁ ca n t ﬁ nd i ng s S u m o f v a l u e s i n c o l u m n s m a y e x cee d c o l u m n t o t a l s b eca u s e s o m e p a p e r s : ( a ) i n c l ud e d m o r e t h a n on e s t udy ; ( b ) u s e d m o r e t h a n on e m ea s u r e o f i d ea ti on qu a lit y ; ( c ) m a n i pu l a t e d o r e xp l o r e d m o r e t h a n on e bound a r y (cid:2) = nu m b e r o f p a p e r s r e po r ti ng a p a r ti c u l a r i d ea ti on qu a lit y m ea s u r e f o r a p a r ti c u l a r i d ea ti on bound a r y , S i g = nu m b e r o f p a p e r s r e po r ti ng a t l ea s t on e s t a ti s ti ca ll y s i gn i ﬁ ca n t e ff ec t f o r a g i v e n m ea s u r e f o r a g i v e n bound a r y I C i d ea - c oun t , S Q s u m - o f - qu a lit y , A Q a v e r a g e qu a lit y , G I P good - i d ea - p r opo r ti on , G I C good - i d ea - c oun t 123 962 B . A . Reinig , R . O . Briggs at least one statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings with respect to idea - count . Barki and Pinsonneault ( 2001 ) , were the one exception that focused solely on quality . Thereisnotcompellingevidenceintheliterature , however , thatthereportedideation interventions would reliably improve idea quality . Thirteen papers reported at least one measure of idea quality . One paper reported sum - of - quality scores ; six reported average - quality scores ; three reported good - idea - proportion scores ; and three reported good - idea - count scores . As discussed above , however , a number of indicators of idea quality had weak construct validity . A statistically signiﬁcant idea - quality effect was reported by eight papers . Three of these papers , however , reported multiple measures of idea - quality , and in none of the three did the measures of quality converge with one another to the same research conclusions . There is also little evidence in the literature of a generalizable relationship between idea - count and idea quality . Eight papers reported both idea - count and idea quality measures . Under a few conditions , idea - count was associated with idea quality ; under a majorityofconditions , however , itwasnot . Inonlytwopapersdidallreportedmeasures of quantity converge with all reported measures of quality . Because of the divergence among quality and quantity measures , we could assume that under many conditions , idea - quantity is not predictive of ideation quality . It is difﬁcult , however , to interpret the ﬁndings to mean that no relationship exists between idea quantity and ideation quality , because the different aggregation approaches to measure ideation quality ( e . g . sum , average , proportion , count ) produced contradictory results , even when applied to the same idea set . This suggests that one or more of the approaches to measuring ideation quality could be sufﬁciently biased to obscure an existing rela - tionship between idea - quantity and ideation - quality . In the next section we examine potential biases in the ﬁve approaches to calculating ideation - quality that were reported in the literature . We use the logic of BIT to discuss the conditions under which those biases would manifest . 4 Measuring Quality in Ideation Research Researchers typically evaluate ideation quality by ﬁrst extracting a non - redundant set of unique ideas from an ideation session , and then having experts rate the quality or creativity of each idea on a multi - point scale across one or more dimensions such as novelty , originality , usefulness or feasibility . They then evaluate the ideation - quality of a session by aggregating the expert idea - quality scores in some way . The most commonly used methods are : • Idea - count : This measure is calculated by totaling the number of unique ideas generated during an ideation session . • Sum - of - quality : This measure is calculated by summing the quality scores of the ideas generated in an ideation session . • Average - quality : This measure is calculated by computing the mean of the quality scores of the ideas generated in an ideation session . • Good - idea - proportion : This measure is calculated by counting the number of unique ideas with quality scores that exceed a certain threshold ( typically the 123 Putting Quality First in Ideation Research 963 Table 6 The effects of additional ideas on the ﬁve measures of ideation quality Effect of an additional bad idea Effect of an additional good idea Potential bias Idea - count Increases score Increases score Positively biased by bad ideas Sum - of - quality Increases score Increases score Positively biased by bad ideas Average - quality Decreases score Increases score Negatively biased by bad ideas Good - idea - proportion Decreases score Increases score Negatively biased by bad ideas Good - idea - count No effect Increases score Unbiased midpoint or higher ) and dividing by the number of unique ideas generated in an ideation session . • Good - idea - count : This measure is calculated by counting the number of unique ideas generated in an ideation session that exceed a certain threshold ( typically the midpoint or higher ) . The literature shows that these measures are not equivalent and lead to different research conclusions . Barki and Pinsonneault ( 2001 ) for example , report that the same idea - quality scores will produce different main effects and different interaction effects depending on whether the idea - count , sum - of - quality , or average - quality scores are used . Reinig et al . ( 2007 ) likewise report different research conclusions , including statistical signiﬁcance in opposite directions , depending on whether a sum - of - quality , average - quality , or good - idea - count approach is used to aggregate an ideation - quality measure . We therefore conclude that these cannot be equally valid measures of ideation quality . Managers and practitioners use ideation for the goal of generating good ideas . We therefore argue that a sound measure of ideation quality would be one where the score increases when additional good ideas emerge , but is relatively unaffected , positively nor negatively , by the emergence of additional bad ideas . Table 6 presents an analysis of the quality aggregation approaches and identiﬁes biases that exist with respect to the generation of additional ideas . Assume for simplicity that each idea in a set had been rated with a quality score ranging from 1 = bad idea to 3 = good idea . All ﬁve measures would be positively affected by the arrival of additional good ideas . The idea - count and sum - of - quality measures however would be positively biased by the emergence of bad ideas . That is , the arrival of each new bad idea would increase each of these scores even though no new good ideas had been added . On the other hand , the average - quality and good - idea - proportion measures would be negatively biased by the emergence of bad ideas . That is , the arrival of each new bad idea would reduce the score , even though no good ideas had been lost . From a practical perspective , good - idea - count most closely aligns with the outcomes practitioners in the ﬁeld desire , that is , high quality ideas , because it is not biased negatively by bad ideas , and beneﬁts from the emergence of good ideas . Thus , it is a useful indicator of that which makes an idea set valuable to stakeholders . 123 964 B . A . Reinig , R . O . Briggs The biases identiﬁed in Table 6 may account for some of the non - convergence of ideation quality metrics reported in the literature . The measurement biases , however , could be complicated by other factors . BIT , for example , predicts conditions under which people might experience increasing returns during ideation , that is , participants would generate an increasingly greater proportion of good ideas as time passed . This could happen , for example , early in an ideation session as a group overcomes an understanding boundary . Under conditions of increasing returns , all ﬁve indicators of ideation - quality may converge despite their biases , because all are sensitive to the addition of good ideas , and fewer - and - fewer bad ideas would be arriving to affect the measures that are negatively biased by bad ideas . BIT also predicts conditions under which participants might experience diminish - ing returns , that is , where participants would produce a lower and lower proportion of good ideas as time passes , for example , later in a session as such as cognitive inertia , exhaustion or scarcity of solution space become manifest ( Briggs and Reinig 2010 ) . Under conditions of diminishing returns , idea - count and sum - of - quality might converge with one another , because the arrival of more bad ideas would continue to increase these measures . Average - quality and good - idea - proportion might also con - verge with one another , because the arrival more bad ideas would bias both these measures negatively . The idea - count and sum - of - quality measures , however , would diverge from idea average - quality and good - idea - proportion because the arrival of bad ideaswouldbiastheminoppositedirections , yieldingconﬂictingresearchconclusions , depending on which aggregation method was used . To advance ideation research , it is important that measures of ideation - quality be valid under all conditions . Because reliability ideation - quality measures could be sen - sitive to the boundaries of BIT , in the next section , we use a Monte Carlo simulation to test the effects of increasing returns , constant returns , and diminishing returns on the reliability of the ﬁve ideation - quality approaches . 4 . 1 Ideation Functions To examine more closely the theoretical conditions under which the ﬁve ideation measures could be used , and to explore circumstances that might cause them to con - verge and diverge as reported in the literature , we consider the BIT ideation function . Figure 2 illustrates three potential ideation functions proposed by Reinig and Briggs ( 2008 ) . The ﬁrst we will call the “increasing returns” function which is characterized by a positive and increasing slope as implied by Osborn ( 1963 ) who conjectured that the better ideas would occur during the later stages of brainstorming . The second is the linear ideation function which assumes a constant slope and constant ratio between good ideas and bad ideas . The third is the “diminishing returns” function which is characterized by a positive and decreasing slope and suggests that the ratio of good ideas to total ideas is decreasing as ideation progresses . BIT suggests conditions under which any or all of these three shapes could occur during ideation in an organizational setting . Ideally , an ideation—quality measure should be reliable and unbiased under all three conditions . 123 Putting Quality First in Ideation Research 965 0 M N 0 Cumulative Number of Ideas C u m u l a t i v e N u m be r o f G ood I dea s Linear ideation function with a constant slope as implied by the conventional quantity - quality conjecture Curvilinear ideation function with a positive but decreasing slope of the diminishing returns hypothesis Curvilinear ideation function with a positive and increasing slope as implied by Osborn’s ( 1963 ) conjecture Fig . 2 Three possible shapes for the ideation function ( reprinted with permission from Reinig and Briggs 2008 ) 4 . 2 Simulation of the Three Ideation Functions We use a Monte Carlo simulation to examine the performance of the ﬁve quality mea - sures under conditions of diminishing returns , increasing returns and linear ideation . The use of a simulation methodology provides a key advantage in the present study ( Naylor et al . 1966 ; Banks and Carson 1984 ) . A simulation provides the data needed to assess the performance of the measures under varying ideation conditions . It allows us to build stochastic models that represent several ideation functions that could manifest during an ideation session . By modeling the conditions of diminishing returns , con - stant returns , and increasing returns , we are able to gain insight into how the various ideation quality measures co - vary when such conditions are known to be present . This process consisted of three steps . In step 1 , we generated a set of numbers where each number represented the idea - count for a simulated group . We chose to generate 50 such idea - counts to represent the output of 50 ideation sessions . The values were generated randomly using a Poisson distribution , which describes the number of events that occur over an interval of time or space . The idea - counts of the ﬁfty sessions ranged from29to64withameanof50 . 14andastandarddeviationof6 . 63 . The idea - counts for the 50 simulated sessions served as the input to the simulations under three conditions of ideation—diminishing returns , constant returns , and increasing returns . In step 2 , we deﬁned the idea - quality scale and its associated probability for the three ideation conditions . It is necessary for the scale to have three or more levels in order to avoid a perfect correlation between average - quality and good - idea - proportion . Thus , each idea was assigned a score on a three - point scale , denoted as Q , where 1 = bad idea , 2 = medium quality idea , and 3 = good idea . Discrete probability functions were then deﬁned to assign probabilities to the random variable Q = { 1 , 2 , 3 } . To simplify computations , we set the probability that Q = 2 , denoted P ( 2 ) , equal to the probability of Q = 3 , denoted P ( 3 ) , for all ideation functions . The linear ideation function describes ideation conditions in which the probability that an idea is good is constant and unaffected by arrival order . We set the probability 123 966 B . A . Reinig , R . O . Briggs that Q = 2 = 3 at 20 % . Thus , for the linear ideation function , the probability that the next idea would be a good idea is 20 % ; the probability that the next idea is a medium quality idea is 20 % , and the probability that the next idea is a bad idea was 60 % . These percentages were chosen because they are representative of what we had encountered in typical ﬁeld sessions . We can express these probability functions as follows : P ( 1 ) = 0 . 6000 P ( 2 ) = 0 . 2000 P ( 3 ) = 0 . 2000 Because the probabilities do not change in the linear ideation function , the arrival order is not included in these equations . The increasing returns ideation function deﬁnes ideation conditions in which the probability than an idea is good increases with idea arrival order . Setting P ( 2 ) = P ( 3 ) as a matter of convenience and X equal to the arrival order of a given idea , we used the following probability functions to create the conditions of increasing returns : P ( 1 ) = 1 − P ( 2 ) − P ( 3 ) P ( 2 ) = 0 . 20000 + 0 . 00002 ( X − 1 ) 2 P ( 3 ) = 0 . 20000 + 0 . 00002 ( X − 1 ) 2 We used X − 1 so that the probability of a good idea would equal 20 % for the ﬁrst idea and then provide modest lift above the linear function thereafter . At idea arrival point 20 , for example , P ( 2 ) = P ( 3 ) = 20 . 80 % , and at idea arrival point 40 , P ( 2 ) = P ( 3 ) = 23 . 20 % . The diminishing returns ideation function deﬁned ideation conditions in which the probability than an idea is good decreases with idea arrival order . Setting P ( 2 ) = P ( 3 ) again as a matter of convenience and consistency , and X equal to the arrival order of a given idea , we used the following probability functions to create the conditions of decreasing returns : P ( 1 ) = 1 − P ( 2 ) − P ( 3 ) P ( 2 ) = 0 . 20000 − 0 . 00002 ( X − 1 ) 2 P ( 3 ) = 0 . 20000 − 0 . 00002 ( X − 1 ) 2 WeusedX − 1sothattheprobabilityofagoodideawouldequal20 % fortheﬁrstidea and be consistent with the linear and increasing returns function . By subtracting the quadratic component , the diminishing returns function falls below the linear function at the same rate that the increasing returns functions rises about the linear function . At idea arrival point 20 , for example , P ( 2 ) = P ( 3 ) = 19 . 20 % , and at idea arrival point 40 , P ( 2 ) = P ( 3 ) = 16 . 80 % . These probability functions , depicted in Fig . 3 , were used with the Monte Carlo simulations to assign quality scores of { 1 , 2 , 3 } to each idea in the ﬁfty simulated idea sets for each of the three ideation functions . These scores were then used to compute the ﬁve quality metrics for each session under each condition of ideation . We used a threshold of 3 ( good idea ) for computing good - idea - proportion and good - idea - count . 123 Putting Quality First in Ideation Research 967 Fig . 3 The probability than an idea will be good by the order of arrival during ideation 4 . 3 Results for Linear Ideation Function A correlation analysis was completed for the quality measures for the linear , increas - ing , and diminishing returns ideation functions . In the linear ideation condition , with good ideas occurring at a constant rate , we hypothesized that there would be a positive correlation between idea - count and sum - of - quality because each measure monotoni - cally increases from both good ideas and bad idea alike , and , further , that the proportion of good ideas would remain relatively constant as idea - count increased . We hypoth - esized a moderate relationship between idea - count and good - idea - count because as more ideas were generated , there was greater opportunity for the emergence of addi - tional good ideas . Neither average - quality nor good - idea - proportion was anticipated to correlate with good - idea count because both are relative measures and , given the constant probabilities , would remain relatively constant aside from random variation . The results of the correlation analysis for the linear ideation function appear in Table 7 . In terms of statistical signiﬁcance and effect size , idea - count correlated with sum - of - quality ( r = 0 . 88 , P < 0 . 001 ) and good - idea - count ( r = 0 . 40 , P < 0 . 001 ) as hypothesized . There was not a statistically signiﬁcant correlation between idea - count and either average - quality or good - idea - proportion . Thus , under conditions of linear ideation , we would expect idea - count to be a relatively poor surrogate for good - idea - count with only 16 % ( r = 0 . 40 2 ) of the variance accounted for . Among the four other measures , good - idea - count had the smallest correlation with idea - count . 123 968 B . A . Reinig , R . O .

More generally , however , increas - ing returns marks the singular conditions in which all ﬁve measures should converge , at least in terms of directionality and statistical signiﬁcance . We would expect the rel - ative measures of average - quality and good - idea - proportion to be larger in the event of a large idea set than with small idea sets and thusly correlate positively with idea count . The results of the correlation analysis for the increasing returns ideation function appear in Table 8 . All correlations were positive and statistically signiﬁcant as hypoth - esized . In terms of effect size , idea - count correlated most heavily with sum - of - quality ( r = 0 . 92 ) . Good - idea - count did correlate with idea - count ( r = 0 . 56 , P < 0 . 001 ) as hypothesized , but it was the smallest correlation between good - idea - count and the four other measures . 4 . 5 Results for Diminishing Returns Ideation Function In the diminishing returns ideation condition , with good ideas occurring at a decreasing rate relative to arrival order , we would expect to see divergence among the ideation measures . Idea - count and sum - of - quality should still evidence a positive relationship because they are both monotonically increasing . However , we hypothesize a negative Table 8 Correlation of quality measures from 50 simulated sessions with an increasing returns ideation function Idea - count Sum - of - quality Average - quality Good - idea - proportion Good - idea - count Idea - count 1 . 00 Sum - of - quality 0 . 92 ∗ 1 . 00 Average - quality 0 . 32 ∗ 0 . 65 ∗ 1 . 00 Good - idea - proportion 0 . 18 ∗ 0 . 50 ∗ 0 . 90 ∗ 1 . 00 Good - idea - count 0 . 56 ∗ 0 . 80 ∗ 0 . 88 ∗ 0 . 91 ∗ 1 . 00 ∗ All sig . correlations have P < 0 . 001 123 Putting Quality First in Ideation Research 969 Table 9 Correlation of quality measures from 50 simulated sessions with a diminishing returns ideation function Idea - count Sum - of - quality Average - quality Good - idea - proportion Good - idea - count Idea - count 1 . 00 Sum - of - quality 0 . 84 ∗ 1 . 00 Average - quality − 0 . 37 ∗ 0 . 19 ∗ 1 . 00 Good - idea - proportion − 0 . 17 ∗ 0 . 31 ∗ 0 . 83 ∗ 1 . 00 Good - idea - count 0 . 28 ∗ 0 . 69 ∗ 0 . 66 ∗ 0 . 89 ∗ 1 . 00 ∗ All sig . correlations have P < 0 . 001 correlation between idea - count and average - quality as well as between idea - count and good - idea - proportion because as more ideas are generated the two relative measures should decrease with the emergence of fewer good ideas . A positive correlation should remain between good - idea - count and idea - count , however , because some additional good ideas will emergence late in the arrival order , even though their likelihood of doing so is diminished . The results of the correlation analysis for the diminishing returns ideation function appear in Table 9 . In terms of statistical signiﬁcance and effect size , idea - count again correlated most heavily with sum - of - quality ( r = 0 . 84 , P < 0 . 001 ) . There was a statistically signiﬁcant negative correlation , however , between idea - count and average - quality ( r = − 0 . 37 , P < 0 . 001 ) and between idea - count and good - idea - proportion ( − 0 . 17 , P < 0 . 001 ) . The correlation between idea - count and good - idea - count was positivebutrelativelyweakashypothesized ( r = 0 . 28 , P < 0 . 001 ) . Asinthecaseofthe linear and increasing returns conditions , good - idea - count had its smallest correlation with idea - count , relative to the other quality measures . 4 . 6 Synthesis of Monte Carlo Simulation Findings The Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that , under all three conditions—increasing returns , linear returns , and diminishing returns—the most direct and least bias mea - sure of ideation quality , good - idea - count , had its weakest correlation with idea quan - tity . Although the simulation used relatively slight increasing returns and diminishing returns effects , the divergence of the quality measures was nonetheless statistically signiﬁcant . Further , for the sake of simplicity , this simulation used a population mean of 50 unique ideas to generate the idea sets . Many of the groups we have worked with in the ﬁeld produce much larger idea sets . The product development team of a multi - national company , for example , routinely produced 300 ideas or more when brainstorming taglines for a new product . Because of the biases inherent in the measures , it is pos - sible that their divergence to conﬂicting research conclusions would become more pronounced as the size of the idea set increased , especially if the relative strengths of diminishing and increasing effects grew with the arrival of additional ideas . 123 970 B . A . Reinig , R . O . Briggs Finally , the Monte Carlo simulation demonstrates that , based solely on the mathe - matical properties of the aggregation methods , idea quantity is , at best a weak predictor of idea quality under conditions that could manifest in the ﬁeld . 5 Discussion The ultimate goal of ideation activities is to acquire good ideas . The ultimate goal of ideation research , therefore , should be to help groups generate good ideas . Bounded Ideation Theory proposes a theoretical explanation for the relationship between idea quantity and idea quality . We used it to aggregate studies with similar theoretical foundations to learn the extent to which the ideation literature addressed each boundary proposed by the theory , the degree to which the literature provides insights about how to improve idea quality , and the degree to which idea quantity could be used as a predictor of idea quality . 5 . 1 On the State of Research with Respect to the BIT Boundaries Most of the studies we analyzed manipulated or explored the attention and goal - congruence boundaries . A much smaller number of studies addressed the under - standing and ability boundaries . None of the studies addressed the exhaustion or scarcity - of - solutions boundaries , ( although we conjecture that one study may have inadvertently invoked a scarcity - of - solutions boundary ) . In order to develop a more complete understanding of idea quality it would be useful in the future for researchers to examine the less - studied boundaries more thoroughly . Doing so could inform the design of better techniques and technologies for producing good ideas . A number of the analyzed studies reported treatments that manipulated several boundaries simultaneously . Barki and Pinsonneault ( 2001 ) , for example , targeted the goal congruence , attention , ability , and understanding boundaries in a single study . This may be a useful way to create more powerful idea quality effects . However , future research would also be useful to disentangle the separate effects of each boundary , and to discover whether interactions among the boundaries exist , and whether they can be used to further enhance ideation quality . 5 . 2 On the State of Research with Respect to Improving Idea Quality The studies we reviewed provided limited evidence that the treatments being used or the conditions being observed improved the quality of ideas that a group produced . A majority of the papers did not report statistically signiﬁcant quality effects . Of those that did , several used sum - of - quality , average - quality , and proportion - of - quality scores , which are weak indictors of idea quality . It is not possible to discern whether these weak indictors were masking real quality effects . It would therefore be useful for authors to recalculate their quality scores using a good - idea - count metric , and to recalculate their statistics to determine the extent to which their treatments were related to ideation quality . 123 Putting Quality First in Ideation Research 971 Where multiple measures of quality were reported , they failed to converge to the same research conclusions , and most studies used measures of ideation - quality that were subsequently demonstrated to be biased . The Monte Carlo simulation demon - strated that , in addition to being biased , average - quality , and good - idea - proportion were sensitive to the shape of the ideation curve , yielding both positive and negative statistically signiﬁcant correlations with idea - count depending on the ideation func - tion . Only one of the commonly used measures of ideation quality , good - idea - count , was unbiased by the presence of bad ideas . Only three of the analyzed studies reported good - idea - count . Others may also have produced an effect on that measure , but they did not measure and report it . For ideation research to progress , therefore , it will be important that researchers develop valid and unbiased indicators of the quality of individual ideas , and that they use good - idea - count to demonstrate improvements in ideation quality . It is interesting to note that , although four of the ﬁve aggregation approaches may be biased , and so not useful as indicators of ideation quality , when they are reported together , they provide potential insight about of the shape of the ideation function for a session . When the measures converge , they indicate conditions of increasing returns ; whereas when the diverge , they indicate conditions of diminishing returns . Porath and Erez ( 2009 ) report a positive correlation between idea - count and average - quality , for example , which suggests that they may have been working under conditions of increasing returns . Baruah and Paulus ( 2008 ) , by contrast , reported metrics that diverged , suggesting that they may have been working under conditions of diminishing returns . Because the boundaries may affect the shape of the ideation function , and because ideation techniques and technologies are meant to affect the shape of the ideation function , it would also be useful if the ideation research community were to begin publishing the shapes and slopes of the ideation functions created by the groups they study . This would provide richer insights about how the mind works during ideation , and how it could better be supported . It might also provide insights about how manip - ulations of the boundaries could be combined to optimize ideation - quality . 5 . 3 On Idea Quantity as in Indicator of Idea Quality The assumption that increasing the number of ideas a group creates will , of necessity , give rise to more good ideas is not supported by the literature or the Monte Carlo simulation . Idea quantity correlated with idea quality in only two of the analyzed studies . The simulation showed only weak correlations between idea - count and good - idea - idea count under all three return conditions . Given that the goal of ideation is to produce more good ideas , in order to move ideation research forward , it will be important that researchers discontinue the use of idea - quantity as a surrogate for idea quality and focus instead on increasing the number of good ideas a group can produce . The good - idea - proportion measure may be useful as a secondary measure of ideation - quality despite its inherent bias . If two ideation techniques produce a similar good - idea - count , then the technique that yields the highest good - idea - proportion may be preferable , because participants will need less time and effort to weed out the bad ideas . 123 972 B . A . Reinig , R . O . Briggs 6 Conclusion The cognitive mechanisms proposed by Bounded Ideation Theory suggest that under some conditions , group ideation efforts should yield diminishing returns , under other conditions constant returns , and under still other conditions , increasing returns . Good - idea - count is the one approach to measuring ideation quality that is free of bias across all these conditions . Furthermore , idea quantity appears to be a poor surrogate for idea quality . The conventional wisdom is that people should contribute all ideas regardless of quality on the assumption that bad ideas may stimulate the production of good ideas . Given that ideation is a high cognitive load activity , however , it is plausible that the contribution of bad ideas interferes with or distracts from a group’s ability to generate good ideas . It may be useful , therefore , for future research to explore whether the cognitive load of processing bad ideas outweighs the potential cognitive beneﬁt of stimulating good ideas . For example , it might be useful to instruct participants to withhold bad ideas and only contribute good ideas to the group . Although the literature does not yet offer compelling evidence that current brain - storming techniques are improving the quality of ideas in brainstorming sessions , there are a number of actions the ideation research community can take to move the research in that direction . Among these are ( a ) developing valid indicators of the quality of an individual idea ; ( b ) abandoning idea quantity as a predictor of idea quality ; ( c ) using good - idea - count as the primary indicator of ideation quality , supported by good - idea proportion as a secondary indicator ; ( d ) report ideation functions along with the aggre - gated measure , good - idea - count ; and ( e ) explore each of the boundaries proposed by BIT separately and together to discover and describe their effects on the ideation func - tion . Ideation research could be advanced considerably by theorizing further about the cognitive factors that produce good ideas and then using an unbiased measure of the ideation quality , namely good - idea - count , as a primary indicator of ideation quality .
