A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature biotechnology advance online publication  A rt i c l e s The demand for engineered tissues has risen rapidly owing to the limited availability of donor tissues and organs for transplantation . Despite some initial successes in engineering relatively simple tissues , many challenges remain in developing tissues and organs suitable for clinical translation 1 , 2 . Three - dimensional ( 3D ) printing technology shows promise for creating complex composite tissue constructs 3 – 8 through precise placement of cell - laden hydrogels in a layer - by - layer fashion 7 , 9 – 17 . The most commonly used bioprinting systems are based on jetting , extrusion and laser - induced forward transfer ( LIFT ) 6 , 18 , 19 . The jetting method produces picoliter scale drops with a printing resolution of 20 ~ 100 µ m . However , because the hydrogel concen - tration is low 20 – 23 , the thickness of printed constructs may be lim - ited because of inadequate structural support 24 . Extrusion methods , which use a syringe and piston system to dispense material through microscale nozzles , can produce more stable 3D cell - laden structures using high concentrations of hydrogels such as alginate , fibrin and Pluronic F - 127 ( refs . 18 , 25 – 27 ) . However , it is difficult to construct large free - form tissue structures owing to inadequate structural integ - rity , mechanical stability and printability 28 – 30 . The LIFT method can precisely print cells in relatively small constructs 31 but requires rapid gelation of hydrogels to achieve high resolution of the printed pat - terns , resulting in low flow rates . Here we describe a system that deposits cell - laden hydrogels together with synthetic biodegradable polymers that impart mechanical strength , thereby overcoming previous limitations on the size , shape , structural integrity and vascularization of bioprinted tissue con - structs . This was accomplished by designing multidispensing modules for delivering various cell types and polymers in a single construct ; by developing an optimized carrier material for delivering cells to discrete locations in the 3D structure in a liquid form ; by designing sophisticated nozzle systems with a resolution down to 2 µ m for bio - materials and down to 50 µ m for cells ; by cross - linking cell - laden hydrogels after passage though the nozzle system ; by simultaneously printing an outer sacrificial acellular hydrogel mold that is dissolved after the tissue construct acquires enough rigidity to retain its shape ; and by creating a lattice of microchannels permissive to nutrient and oxygen diffusion into the printed tissue constructs . These properties , all designed to work in a coordinated manner , make up the ITOP . We demonstrate the printer by fabricating human - scale mandible bone , ear - shaped cartilage and organized skeletal muscle . Evaluation of the characteristics and function of these tissues in vitro and in vivo showed tissue maturation and organization that may be sufficient for translation to patients . RESULTSDesign of the ITOP system Multiple cartridges ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) are used to deliver and pattern multiple cell - laden composite hydrogels , support - ing poly ( ε - caprolactone ) ( PCL ) polymer and a sacrificial Pluronic F - 127 hydrogel ( Fig . 1b ) . The end of each cartridge is connected to a microscale nozzle , and the top is connected to an air pressure controller for precisely controlling the dispensing volume . A heating unit ensures that the PCL remains easily dispensable . A three - axis motorized stage system enables 3D patterning of multiple cells and biomaterials . The system resides in a humidified and temperature - controlled ( 18 °C ) enclosure . The correct shape of a tissue construct is obtained from a human body by processing computed tomography ( CT ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data in computer - aided design ( CAD ) software ( Fig . 1c ) . A custom nozzle motion program is generated by incorporating A 3D bioprinting system to produce human - scale tissue constructs with structural integrity Hyun - Wook Kang , Sang Jin Lee , In Kap Ko , Carlos Kengla , James J Yoo & Anthony Atala A challenge for tissue engineering is producing three - dimensional ( 3D ) , vascularized cellular constructs of clinically relevant size , shape and structural integrity . We present an integrated tissue – organ printer ( ITOP ) that can fabricate stable , human - scale tissue constructs of any shape . Mechanical stability is achieved by printing cell - laden hydrogels together with biodegradable polymers in integrated patterns and anchored on sacrificial hydrogels . The correct shape of the tissue construct is achieved by representing clinical imaging data as a computer model of the anatomical defect and translating the model into a program that controls the motions of the printer nozzles , which dispense cells to discrete locations . The incorporation of microchannels into the tissue constructs facilitates diffusion of nutrients to printed cells , thereby overcoming the diffusion limit of 100 – 200 m m for cell survival in engineered tissues . We demonstrate capabilities of the ITOP by fabricating mandible and calvarial bone , cartilage and skeletal muscle . Future development of the ITOP is being directed to the production of tissues for human applications and to the building of more complex tissues and solid organs .

The ITOP uses a text - based motion program consisting of a command list for XYZ stage movements and air pressure actuation ( Supplementary Source Code ) . The motion program is then transferred to the main computer of the 3D printing system that effects the biofabrication process . The composite hydrogel for cell delivery consisted of gelatin , fibrinogen , hyaluronic acid ( HA ) and glycerol mixed into DMEM ( high glucose ) . We tested various concentrations of each component to achieve proper print - ing resolution and dispensing uniformity , mechanical properties ( before and after cross - linking with thrombin ) and cell viability ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The optimized concentrations of hydro - gel ingredients and the numbers of cells needed for fabrication of individual tissue constructs are listed in Table 1 . Patterning synthetic polymers confers mechanical strength Our first series of studies tested the ability of the ITOP to generate uni - form two - dimensional ( 2D ) and 3D cell patterns of multiple cell types . Using 3T3 fibroblasts labeled with two fluorescent dyes , Dil ( red ) and DiO ( green ) , we demonstrated delivery of the two populations in a unique 2D pattern ( Fig . 2a , b ) . To create 3D constructs , we combined the fluorescently labeled 3T3 fibroblasts in composite hydrogels with supporting PCL and printed them in two patterns—type I ( Fig . 2c ) and type II ( Fig . 2f ) . These patterns differ in the placement of PCL and thus in the mechanical strength of the printed construct . The type I pattern creates multiple PCL frames in each layer throughout the con - struct , and places cells and gel materials in between the frames . The type II pattern consists of cell - laden hydrogel and porous structures , surrounded by a PCL framework on the outer layers and corners of each layer , thus protecting the contents from external load . Type I constructs ( Fig . 2d , e ) maintained a more stable structure than type II constructs ( Fig . 2g , h ) , owing to the abundance of uniformly distrib - uted PCL frames . Therefore , we used the type I pattern to fabricate mandible bone and ear - shaped cartilage structures and the type II pattern to print organized skeletal muscle constructs . Next , we produced 3D structures by placing either type I or type II pat - terns of cell - laden hydrogel and PCL ( ~ 130 µ m for type I and ~ 250 µ m wide for type II ) . The microchannels ( type I : 500 × 300 µ m 2 ; type II : 650 × 450 µ m 2 ) , formed by the PCL patterns , were designed to maxi - mize diffusion of nutrients and oxygen . In addition , we used Pluronic F - 127 hydrogel as a sacrificial outer layer to support the 3D architecture of the dispensed cell - laden structures before crosslinking . After cross - linking of fibrinogen using thrombin , the uncross - linked components ( gelatin , HA , glycerol and Pluronic F - 127 ) were washed out . To determine cell viability during printing , we examined survival of 3T3 fibroblasts at 60 min ( day 0 ) , 3 d and 6 d after printing . Live / dead cell assays showed ≥ 95 % cell viability on day 0 , which was maintained through days 3 and 6 ( Fig . 2i ) . Cell proliferation , assessed using the AlamarBlue assay system , increased over a 15 - d period , similar to the proliferation of control cells encapsulated in a fibrin construct ( Fig . 2j ) . These data indicate that the optimized composite hydrogel system maintained cell viability during the printing process and provided a favorable microenvironment for cell proliferation . Mandible bone reconstruction To demonstrate construction of a human - sized bone structure , we fab - ricated a mandible fragment in a size and shape similar to what would be needed for facial reconstruction after traumatic injury ( Fig . 3 ) .

Mandible bone defects have an arbitrary shape . We used data from a CT scan of a human mandible defect in combination with Mimics software ( Materialise , Leuven , Belgium ) to produce a CAD model of the defect shape , with dimensions of 3 . 6 cm × 3 . 0 cm × 1 . 6 cm ( Fig . 3a ) . A text - based command motion program , gener - ated from the CAD model with custom CAM software , determined the required dispensing paths of cell - laden hydrogel , a mixture of PCL and tricalcium phosphate ( TCP ) , and Pluronic F127 ( Fig . 3b ) . PCL / TCP and hAFSCs mixed with the composite hydrogel ( Table 1 ) were printed in a type I pattern with a Pluronic F127 temporary sup - port ( Fig . 3c ) . At 1 d of culture , cell viability in the printed bone structures was 91 ± 2 % ( n = 3 , Table 1 ) , confirming that the printing process did not adversely affect cell viability . After induction of osteo - genic differentiation using an established protocol 32 , 33 for 28 d ( n = 5 , Fig . 3d ) , we stained the structures with Alizarin Red S ; staining at the surface of the 3D bone structures indicated calcium deposition in the hAFSC - laden hydrogel ( Fig . 3e ) . 3D constructs before differentiation showed no Alizarin Red S staining ( data not shown ) . Calvarial bone reconstruction To study maturation of the bioprinted bone in vivo , we fabricated rat calvarial bone constructs in a circular shape ( 8 mm diameter × 1 . 2 mm thickness ) with hAFSCs ( Fig . 4a , b and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , cultured them in osteogenic media for 10 d , implanted them in a calvarial bone defect region of Sprague Dawley rats ( n = 4 ) and analyzed them 5 months after implantation ( Fig . 4c ) .

The modified Tetrachrome staining confirmed mature bone ( red ) and osteoid ( blue ) for - mation ( Fig . 4e , h , k ) . Von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) immunostaining showed large blood vessel formation within newly formed bone tissue throughout the bioprinted bone con - structs , including the central portion ( Fig . 4l ) , whereas the nontreated ( Fig . 4f ) and scaffold - only ( Fig . 4i ) groups had only limited vascu - larization restricted to the periphery of the implant . Ear cartilage reconstruction Next , we tested the ability of the ITOP to fabricate tissue constructs of complex shape by making human - sized external ears , as the frame - work of an auricle consists of a single piece of cartilage with a com - plicated geometry of ridges . A CT image of an ear ( Fig . 5a ) was used to develop a motion program ( Fig . 5b ) to print a chondrocyte - laden hydrogel , PCL and Pluronic F - 127 . Using rabbit ear chondrocytes ( passages 3 and 4 ) mixed with the composite hydrogel ( Table 1 ) , we fabricated human ear – shaped cartilage constructs with dimensions of 3 . 2 cm × 1 . 6 cm × 0 . 9 cm ( Fig . 5c – e ) in the type I pattern . Cell viabil - ity was 91 ± 8 % at 1 d after printing ( n = 3 , Table 1 ) . After 5 weeks in the culture medium , the constructs were stained with Safranin - O and showed production of a new cartilaginous matrix ( Fig . 5f ) . The constructs with microchannels showed enhanced tissue forma - tion as evidenced by the production of new viable cartilaginous matrix throughout the entire ear constructs . In contrast , the constructs without microchannels showed only limited tissue formation restricted to the peripheral region , likely owing to the diffusion limits of nutrients and oxygen . The cells in the newly formed tissues demonstrated similar morphological characteristics to those in native ear cartilage , with cells located within typical chondrocyte lacunae , surrounded by a cartilaginous matrix ( Fig . 5g ) . Native human ear tissue served as a positive control . To determine whether the printed ear constructs would mature in vivo , we implanted them in the dorsal subcutaneous space of athymic mice and retrieved them 1 and 2 months after implantation ( n = 4 ) . The shape was well maintained , with substantial cartilage formation upon gross examination ( Fig . 5h ) . Histological analysis showed the for - mation of cartilage tissue ( Fig . 5i ) . The glycosaminoglycan ( GAG ) content ( 2 . 7 ± 0 . 2 µ g / mg at 1 month and 4 . 2 ± 0 . 3 µ g / mg at 2 months ) increased over time , reaching 20 % of that of native ear GAG content ( Fig . 5j ) . Vascularization of the printed constructs in the outer region was suggested by endothelial cell marker expression at 1 and 2 months after implantation ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . The inner regions were avascular ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , as in native cartilage , but the car - tilage cells were viable , suggesting adequate nutrient diffusion during development . Biomechanical analyses ( n = 4 , Fig . 5k ) showed that maturation in vivo strengthened the tissue constructs , resulting in a higher normalized load during bending compared with pre - implant constructs . In addition , resilience , measured by the ∆ Load % , was tested by repeated bending and relaxation cycles . Resilience between the repeated bending cycles was much higher in the constructs implanted for 1 month ( Fig . 5m and Supplementary Table 1 ) than in the con - structs before implantation ( Fig . 5l ) . These results demonstrate the generation of ear - shaped cartilage with resilience properties similar to those of native cartilage ( rabbit ear ) ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Skeletal muscle reconstruction Finally , we applied the ITOP to fabricate an organized soft tissue—a 3D muscle construct 15 mm × 5 mm × 1 mm in dimension containing Figure 4 Calvarial bone reconstruction .

Immediately after printing , the printed structures contained mus - cle fiber – like bundles ( ~ 400 µ m width ) , supporting PCL pillars and Pluronic F - 127 hydrogel as a temporary structure ( Fig . 6c and Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . Notably , the printed cells began stretch - ing along the longitudinal axis of the constructs at day 3 in growth media ( Fig . 6e and Supplementary Fig . 5b ) with high cell viability ( Fig . 6f ) , and the constructs underwent compaction 34 , keeping the fibers taut during cell growth and differentiation , whereas the printed cells without PCL support did not show cellular alignment ( Fig . 6d ) . After 7 d in differentiation media , muscle - like structures with aligned myotubes were observed ( Fig . 6g and Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . To study whether these structures could mature into functional muscle in vivo , we implanted 7 - d differentiated structures subcutane - ously ( ectopically ) in 14 - to 16 - week - old nude rats ( n = 6 ) . The dis - sected distal end of the proximal stump of the common peroneal nerve ( CPN ) was embedded within the constructs to promote integration ( Fig . 6h , i ) . Adequate innervation of implanted muscle is essential to achieve and maintain muscle function . Our model allowed us to eval - uate nerve integration of the implanted muscle construct independ - ent of the surrounding muscle tissue . After 2 weeks of implantation , the retrieved muscle constructs showed well - organized muscle fiber structures ( Fig . 6j ) , the presence of acetylcholine receptor ( AChR ) clusters on the muscle fibers ( MHC + and α - BTX + ) ( Fig . 6k ) , as well as nerve ( neurofilament ) contacts with α - BTX + structures within the implants ( Fig . 6l ) , indicating that the printed muscle constructs were robust enough to maintain their structural characteristics and induce nerve integration in vivo . In addition , vascularization throughout the muscle constructs was indicated by endothelial cell marker expression ( Fig . 6m ) . To examine muscle function , we performed electromyogra - phy to evaluate electrical and neurological activation of the constructs 2 weeks after implantation .

DIScUSSIOn Bioprinters based on jetting , extrusion and LIFT methods can deliver viable cells , biomaterials and macromolecules to generate 3D tissue structures . However , in general they are limited in their ability to gen - erate large biological constructs with sufficient structural integrity for surgical implantation 28 – 30 , and the few in vivo studies of bioprinted tissue structures tested less complex constructs with low mechanical stability 35 , 36 . The ITOP can address the limitations of size and sta - bility by sequentially printing cell - laden hydrogels with a synthetic polymer and a temporary scaffolding , creating tissue constructs with the structural integrity needed for surgical implantation . A computer - generated 3D tissue model can be converted to a motion program that operates and guides the dispensing nozzles to take defined paths for delivery of cells and materials . The cell - laden hydrogel protects cell viability and promotes growth and expansion , whereas the adjacent sacrificial scaffolding provides the initial structural and architectural integrity . As the cells anchored three dimensionally within the hydro - gel initiate the transition to tissue formation , they start to secrete their own matrix , replacing the hydrogel as it slowly degrades over time . The system’s modular design enables printing of a wide array of tissue constructs . Here we used up to four material repositories , but many additional repositories could be installed to print constructs contain - ing multiple cell types and biomaterials . Cell carriers for bioprinting must provide adequate mechanical support , cell - specific cues and negligible cytotoxicity . As few such materials are available 37 , 38 , we fulfilled these requirements with a mixture of gelatin , fibrinogen , HA and glycerol . Gelatin was used because of its thermo - sensitive properties : it is liquid above 37 °C , solid below 25 °C . Fibrinogen provides stability to the gel and a microenvironment conducive to cell adhesion and proliferation .

The concentrations of gelatin , fibrinogen , HA and glycerol were optimized to protect cells from physical stress during printing . Although the optimized cell carrier is dispensed as a weak hydrogel , it has the favorable dispensing characteristics of high - viscosity mate - rials , maintaining its position and shape without cross - linking even on porous surfaces . This allowed for the creation of microchannels made of both cell - laden hydrogel and PCL patterns for nutrient and oxygen diffusion into the printed constructs . Most other bioprinters use liquid cell carriers that do not retain their shape . The composi - tion of our composite hydrogel can be adjusted depending on the cell concentration and construct size . To endow printed constructs with structural strength , we used PCL internally and Pluronic F127 as an external sacrificial scaffold . PCL is biocompatible , flexible , and has a low melting temperature of 60 °C 39 , enabling co - printing with cell - laden hydrogel . These properties , together with its rapid cooling after extrusion , and the microchannel distance gap between the PCL and cell - laden hydrogel , minimize cell damage from heat transfer . PCL also has a relatively long degradation time ( ~ 1 . 5 to 2 years ) 40 , which provides long - term structural stability . In contrast , materials with more rapid degradation often generate byproducts and can cause dimensional deformation 41 , 42 . Pluronic F127 is easy to print uniformly and structurally strong 24 but is little used in tissue engineering because of its poor cell compatibility 43 . However , printing an outer mold of bio - inert Pluronic F127 simulta - neously with the inner tissue construct allows the latter to retain its shape throughout the printing process . Once printing is complete , the Pluronic F127 shell is immediately washed out . Conventional tissue engineering has demonstrated success in gen - erating bone , cartilage and muscle 44 – 46 , but achieving reproducible , complex architectures that are well vascularized and suitable for clinical use has proved challenging 1 , 2 . These three tissues have also been fab - ricated with bioprinters , although only as 2D or small structures 47 , 48 . The ITOP produces human - scale tissue constructs with complex architectures and high structural integrity . This study demonstrates the feasibility of printing sizable living tissue constructs that mature into vascularized functional tissues in vivo , indicating potential utility in translational applications . The application to bone showed that it provides a favorable microenvironment for osteogenic differentia - tion of hAFSCs in vitro and subsequent tissue maturation in vivo , consistent with our previous study of bone constructs generated from hAFSCs 32 . The application to cartilage demonstrated generation of a complex , human ear – shaped tissue construct containing cartilage tissue that possesses histological and mechanical characteristics of human auricles after implantation in vivo . Finally , the application to skeletal muscle reproduced the structure of native muscle—highly oriented myofiber bundles formed from numerous fused mononucle - ated muscle cells 49 , 50 . All three tissue constructs showed promising structural and functional characteristics in vitro and in vivo . It is well established that the maximum nutrient diffusion distance for cells to survive without vascularity is ~ 100 – 200 µ m 51 . Creation of cell constructs larger than this scale requires vascularity . Several approaches have been used to promote mass transfer of nutrients and oxygen in engineered tissues , including growth factors that stimu - late angiogenesis 22 , 52 , 53 . The ITOP allows for the use of microchan - nels with a porous lattice design that facilitate nutrient and oxygen diffusion 54 – 56 , extending the diffusion limit . We demonstrated that constructs with microchannels resulted in enhanced tissue for - mation ( Fig . 5f ) . Cartilage structures of 3 . 2 cm × 1 . 6 cm × 0 . 9 cm showed adequate tissue formation without necrosis after 5 weeks in vitro ( Fig . 5g ) . The bioprinted bone , ear and muscle constructs implanted in vivo showed evidence of vascularization without necrosis ( Figs . 4l , 5i and 6m ) , and the muscle constructs showed the presence of neuromuscular junctions ( Fig . 6k , l ) . We used two primary cell types ( chondrocytes and hAFSCs ) and two cell lines , fibroblasts ( 3T3 ) and myoblasts ( C2C12 ) , to validate the ITOP . As with all tissue engineering approaches , building human tis - sues for clinical use requires large numbers of human cells . Obtaining sufficient numbers of primary cells from a small tissue biopsy is fea - sible and has been performed for numerous tissue engineering appli - cations in humans 57 – 59 . In this study , we used cell concentration per volume as a standard means of calculating the numbers of cells used to ensure uniform , consistent placement of cells regardless of differences in construct dimensions . Our implantation studies in nude mice and rats—in ectopic sites for cartilage and muscle and an orthotopic site for bone—did not assess therapeutic efficacy but were designed to evaluate cell survival and tissue formation . Implantation of bioprinted bone in a calvarial bone defect model in immune - competent animals showed the formation of mature , vascularized bone tissue in implants retrieved up to 5 months later . However , we did not evaluate the host immune response . In - depth , longer - term studies are needed to improve under - standing of regeneration enabled by bioprinted tissues . In conclusion , the ITOP can generate 3D free - form shapes with multiple types of cells and biomaterials , resulting in various archi - tectures with the potential to form various vascularized tissue types . With further development , this technology may produce clinically useful tissues and organs that incorporate multiple cell types at precise locations to recapitulate native structure and function .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature biotechnology doi : 10 . 1038 / nbt . 3413 OnLInE METhODS Integrated tissue and organ printer . The integrated tissue and organ printing ( ITOP ) is composed of an XYZ stage / controller , dispensing module , and a closed chamber ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . A three - axis stage system ( Aerotech , Inc . , Pittsburgh , PA ) having 200 × 200 × 100 mm 3 travel and con - troller ( Aerotech , Inc . ) were used to provide printing paths for the 3D bioprint - ing process . The resolutions of this system were 250 nm and 500 nm for the XY axes and the Z axis , respectively . The dispensing module consisted of a preci - sion pneumatic pressure controller ( ML - 808FXcom ; Musashi Engineering , Inc . , Tokyo , Japan ) , syringe heater ( TB - 10E - K ; Musashi Engineering , Inc . ) , syringe ( Musashi Engineering , Inc . ) and nozzle ( Musashi Engineering , Inc . ) . Finally , the closed - chamber system was constructed by equipping a temper - ature controller ( ThermoTEC ; EIC Solutions , Inc . , Warminster , PA ) and a humidifier ( AOS 7146 , AIR - O - SWISS , Widnau , Switzerland ) in the custom - ized acrylic enclosure . The ITOP is made up of multiple cartridges to individually deliver various synthetic polymers and / or cell - laden hydrogels of various cell types . We have employed the extrusion - method used in Fused Deposition Modeling ( FDM ) to design this novel ITOP concurrently with computer aided - design and computer aided - manufacturing ( CAD / CAM ) to produce living tissue constructs with complex shape and large size . Generation of motion program . The process can be started by scanning the patient to obtain 3D volumetric information on a target tissue or organ using medical imaging modalities such as CT and MRI . The imaging tools acquire information from cross - sectional slices of the body , and the data are stored in the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine ( DICOM ) format . This format is then transformed into a 3D CAD model by a medical image processing software , Mimics ( Materialise , Leuven , Belgium ) . The CAD model is converted to a motion program , which describes the operation of the dis - pensing nozzles using a customized software developed with Visual Studio 6 . 0 ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA ) which generated the motion programs transferred from the CAD model . This software was constructed by slicing and path - generation algorithms , which are used in rapid prototyping technology 60 , 61 . The slicing process is used to obtain information of the sliced profile of a CAD model at a specific height . The information is generated by geometric calcula - tion of intersected lines between a plane of specific height and triangular facets composing a stereolithography ( STL ) model , which is a standardized file for - mat to store 3D CAD model , and it is generally used in 3D printing . Path gen - eration is conducted by applying a user - defined strategy to the sliced profile . For this purpose , we used a parallel line hatching method 61 . Intersection points between the profile and user - defined parallel lines were calculated , and the tool path information was generated by gathering parallel lines that are positioned inside of the profile . The generated path information is combined with other fabrication information such as scanning speed , air pressure and dispensing material , and transformed to text - based motion program . Finally , this motion program is transferred to the operating computer for printing the 3D tissue architectures . Preparation of cell carrier material , synthetic polymer and sacrificial hydrogel . Three components were used to produce the 3D architectures : com - posite hydrogel , PCL polymer and Pluronic F - 127 . The composite hydrogel as a cell carrier material is a mixture of gelatin ( G6411 ) , fibrinogen ( F8630 ) , HA ( 53747 ) and glycerol ( G2025 ) , which were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) . Briefly , HA was dissolved in DMEM by stirring the solution at 37 °C overnight . Glycerol was added into the solution and stirred for 1 h . The solution was gently shaken after adding the gelatin and fibrinogen for 1 h . The procedure resulted in final concentrations of gelatin ( 35 ~ 45 mg / ml ) , fibrinogen ( 20 – 30 mg / ml ) , HA ( 3 mg / ml ) and glycerol ( 10 % v / v ) . The final concentrations of this composite hydrogel were optimized for each target tissue ( Table 1 ) . The prepared solution was sterilized by filtration through a 0 . 45 - µ m syringe filter and was stored at −20 °C before use . The cells were gently mixed with this composite solution in a water bath at 37 °C . As a supporting mate - rial , PCL ( Mw ; 43 , 000 ~ 50 , 000 , Polysciences , Inc . , Warrington , PA ) was used through the melting process . For sacrificial material , Pluronic F - 127 in powder form ( P2443 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) was added to a 10 % v / v glycerol solution at a final concentration of 33 % w / v . The solution was slowly shaken at 4 °C for 1 ~ 2 d and stored at 4 °C . 2D and 3D printing process . This cell - laden composite hydrogel and Pluronic F - 127 were loaded into plastic syringes . PCL polymer was loaded into a metal syringe which was heated at 92 . 5 °C for melting . In the printing process , the cell - laden hydrogel was printed through a 300 - µ m Teflon nozzle at 50 ~ 80 KPa of air pressure and the Pluronic F127 was printed through a 250 - µ m metal nozzle at 200 ~ 300 KPa of air pressure . The PCL polymer was printed through a 250 - µ m cone - shaped metal nozzle at 800 KPa of air pressure . The temperature in the chamber was maintained at 18 °C during the printing process . After printing , the printed 3D architectures were cross - linked by the addition of a thrombin solution ( 20 UI / ml , T4648 , Sigma - Aldrich ) for 30 min at room temperature . Then , the Pluronic F127 was washed out with cold PBS solution for three times ( 3 min / wash ) , and the PBS solution was exchanged with culture medium . Cell culture . Four cell types were used ; 3T3 fibroblasts ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) , C2C12 myoblasts ( ATCC ) , human amniotic fluid - derived stem cells ( hAFSCs ) and rabbit primary auricular chondrocytes . 3T3 fibroblasts were used for hydrogel optimization and initial 3D patterning . Briefly , cells were cul - tured in high glucose Dulbecco’s Modifies Eagle Medium ( DMEM , Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( FBS ) , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . Red and green cell labeling was performed using the Vybrant Multicolor Cell Labeling kit ( V - 22889 ; Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer’s instruction . Human AFSCs were used for printing the mandible bone structures . The isolation of hAFSCs has been previously described 32 . Briefly , human amni - ocentesis cultures were harvested by trypsinization , and subjected to c - kit immunoselection . Human AFSCs ( H1 cell line ) were received at passage 17 and cultured in α - Minimum Essential Medium ( α - MEM ) supplemented with 15 % ES - FBS , 18 % Chang B ( Irvine Scientific , Santa Ana , CA ) , 2 % Chang C ( Irvine Scientific ) , 100 U / ml penicillin , 100 µ g / ml streptomycin , and 2 mM l - glutamine . For osteogenic differentiation , the 3D architecture of the man - dible bone structure was cultured in low glucose DMEM medium , 10 % FBS and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin with osteogenic supplements ( 100 nM dex - amethasone ( Sigma ) , 10 mM β - glycerol phosphate ( Sigma ) , 50 µ M ascorbic acid 2 - phosphate ( Sigma ) ) . Auricular chondrocytes used for printing human ear structures were isolated from New Zealand White rabbits ( male , 2 . 5 – 3 . 5 kg , Charles River Labs . , Inc . , Wilmington , MA ) by digesting with collagenase type I 62 . The isolated chondrocytes were cultured in DMEM / F - 12 mixture with 10 % FBS , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin and 0 . 25 µ g / ml amphotericin B . The printed 3D ear constructs were cultured in DMEM / F - 12 with 10 ng / ml transforming growth factor β 3 ( TGF - β 3 ) ( ProSpec - Tany TechnoGene Ltd . , Rehovot , Israel ) , 50 µ g / ml l - ascorbic acid 2 - phosphate ( Sigma ) , 100 nM dexamethasone ( Sigma ) , 50 mg / ml ITS premix ( BD , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin and 0 . 25 µ g / ml amphotericin B . 20 µ g / ml aprotinin ( Sigma ) was added to the culture medium to inhibit enzyme activity and stabilize the 3D architecture . C2C12 myoblasts used for printing skeletal muscle constructs were cul - tured in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . For muscle cell differentiation , the printed 3D muscle constructs were cultured in DMEM / F - 12 mixture containing 1 % horse serum and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . All reagents for cell culture were purchased from Gibco Cell Culture ( Life Technologies ) . 3T3 fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts were verified with phase contrast microscopy using cellular morphology , growth characteristics and comparison with reference images . Specifically , C2C12 myoblasts were validated via myo - tube formation . Both cell lines were tested and were mycoplasma - free . Cell viability .

After washing the 3D printed patterns with PBS , the assay solution was added to the samples © 201 6 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature biotechnology doi : 10 . 1038 / nbt . 3413 incubated at room temperature for 2 h . Fluorescence microscopy was used to evaluate the live / dead staining of cells in the printed constructs . Total six fluorescence images from each sample were taken : three images from the top of sample and another three images were taken from bottom . In the images , the live cells are shown as green and dead cells are red . The number of live and dead cell was manually counted . After counting live and dead cells , cell viability was calculated by dividing the number of live cells ( confirmed by Trypan Blue staining before the printing process ) by the total number of cells in the printed constructs . Cell proliferation . AlamarBlue assay kit ( DAL1100 ; Life Technologies ) was used to measure cell proliferation within the printed constructs according to the manufacturer’s instruction . Briefly , after mixing the assay solution with cell culture medium at a 1 : 10 volume ratio , 500 µ l / ml of this mixture was added to each construct and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C . After incuba - tion , 100 µ l of assay solution from each sample was placed into the wells of a 96 - well plate and fluorescence intensity was measured using a microplate reader at the excitation / emission of 544 nm / 590 nm ( SpectraMax M5 , Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . After removing all assay solution and washing the samples twice with PBS , the samples were cultured further for use in the next experiment . Mandible bone reconstruction . The mineralized extracellular matrix secreted by hAFSCs was evaluated using Alizarin Red S staining . Calcium deposition that had occurred in the printed mandible bone structure containing hAFSCs was visualized using Alizarin Red S staining at 28 d of osteogenic differen - tiation . Briefly , the printed bone tissue constructs were washed three times with PBS and fixed in ice - cold 70 % ethanol for 1 h . Following a rinse with deionized water , the constructs were stained in 40 mM Alizarin Red S solution ( pH 4 . 2 ) for 10 min . After several washes with deionized water , images of stained samples were taken using a digital microscope ( AD413TL , AnMo Electronics , Taipei ) . Calvarial bone reconstruction . The bioprinted constructs for calvarial bone reconstruction were composed of PCL doped with tricalcium phosphate ( TCP ) nanoparticles ( Berkeley Advanced Biomaterials , Berkeley , CA ) at a 1 : 1 ratio by weight and cell - laden hydrogel dispensed in an interleaved crosshatch pattern . The mixture of PCL and TCP was printed through a 200 - µ m diameter nozzle ( TECDIA Inc . , Campbell , CA ) with 780 kPa compressed air . These materials were heated to 112 °C in the heating chamber of ITOP to produce a beam width of 200 µ m . The printed PCL / TCP architecture provided an internal porosity of approximately 70 % . The top and bottom surfaces of the construct were printed with beam heights of 50 µ m and 220 µ m pitch resulting in 100 - µ m thick region of low porosity to minimize host cell infiltration . The cell - laden hydrogel was printed within the internal pores of the PCL / TCP structure , which was produced with 115 µ m beam height and 670 µ m pitch with repeating layers such that resultant wall heights reached 345 µ m . The cell - laden hydrogel was composed of 5 × 10 6 hAFSCs per ml of the hydro - gel described above and printed through a 300 µ m diameter Teflon - lined nee - dle nozzle ( Musashi Engineering Inc . ) at 60 kPa . After printing , constructs were treated with a thrombin solution to induce fibrinogen conversion to fibrin , as well as osteogenic culture conditions . Constructs were incubated in osteogenic differentiation media for 10 d before implantation . Rats ( Sprague Dawley ) weighing 250 – 300 g were purchased from Charles River . The top of the cranium was exposed by a midline incision through skin and periosteum after anesthetization with isoflurane . A trephine burr was used to drill an 8 - mm diameter defect in the center of the calvarial bone . After the implant was inserted into the defect , the incision was closed in layers using 3 - 0 and 4 - 0 sutures . The cutaneous sutures were removed 10 – 14 d after sur - gery . Animals were euthanized by CO 2 asphyxiation . Samples were fixed for 48 h in 10 % buffered formalin , with one change after 24 h , then decalcified in Richard Allen Scientific Decalcifying Solution ( Thermo Scientific ) . Samples were embedded in paraffin for sectioning and staining . Sections were stained with H & E and modified tetrachrome . Immunostaining for the vascularization was performed using a primary antibody , von Willebrand factor ( vWF ; 1 : 400 , cat . no . A0082 , DAKO , Carpinteria , CA ) and developed with ImmPRESS DAB chromagen ( Vector Labs , Burlingame , CA ) . Ear cartilage reconstruction . The printed ear tissue constructs were pre - pared for histological analysis by fixation in 10 % phosphate - buffered forma - lin at room temperature for 24 h . Subsequently , the samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned into 5 µ m sections . Deparaffinized sections were stained with Safranin - O , which confirmed the cellular morphology and gly - cosaminoglycans ( GAG ) production . Briefly , the samples were incubated with 0 . 1 % Safranin - O dye solution followed by Weigert’s iron hematoxylin . Fast green solution ( 0 . 01 % ) was used as a counter stain for identification of nuclei and cytoplasm . The stained images were taken using a light microscope ( DM4000 B , Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) . For the in vivo animal studies , the printed ear constructs were implanted in dorsal subcutaneous pockets in athymic nude mice ) . After implantation , the skin was closed with Vicryl 6 - 0 sutures . All animal studies were conducted in accordance with Wake Forest University Animal Care and Use Committee ( ACUC ) regulations . The implanted ear constructs were harvested after 1 and 2 months and the constructs were evaluated by H & E and Safranin - O staining as described above . For immunostaining , the formalin - fixed ear constructs were subjected to pepsin antigen retrieval at 37 °C for 20 min and blocked in serum - free blocking solution ( Vector Labs ) , and incubated with primary antibody for collagen type II ( 1 : 30 ; Southern Biotech , cat . no . 1320 - 01 , Birmingham , AL ) and vWF ( 1 : 400 , DAKO ) . The Blyscan Sulfated Glycosaminoglycan Assay kit ( Biocolor Ltd . , Antrim , UK ) was used to measure GAG contents ( µ g / mg of wet weight of tissue ) in the native ear cartilage and the implanted printed ear constructs by colorimetric quantification according to the manufacturer’s instruction . Measurements from standards set the concentration curve that was used to determine test sample concentrations . In order to evaluate the mechanical properties of the implanted ear con - structs , three - point bending was conducted to assess the mechanical strength of the printed constructs after printing and after in vivo implantation . Rabbit ear cartilage was also cut to the same dimensions and tested as positive con - trols . Bending support struts were placed 5 mm apart and an extension of 2 mm was conducted at a rate of 1 . 2 mm / min 63 . Each specimen was sub - jected to serial bending in order to see plastic deformation after four cycles . Resilience of the tissue was interrogated by 3 - point bending and the results were quantified as follows . ∆ = × −     − Load F F F C n Cn C C % 0 0 0 100 where C 0 is initial cycle and C n is the nth cycle . The bending assay shows if fatigue occurs gradually throughout testing ( C 1 - 4 ) , as seen in native tis - sue , or more specifically fails in the beginning ( C 1 - 2 ) or end of testing ( C 2 - 4 ) . Calculations were performed to ascertain the average difference in normalized loading at 50 % extension between cycles 1 - 2 and 1 - 4 . Skeletal muscle organization . Immunohistochemical staining for myosin heavy chain ( MHC ) was performed to evaluate myotube formation within the 3D printed constructs . Briefly , the samples were incubated with MF - 20 antibody ( 1 µ g / ml ) ( Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , Iowa City , IA ) for 1 h . The samples were then incubated in the secondary AlexaFluor 488 goat anti - mouse IgG ( Life Technologies ) for 30 min . Finally , the samples were visualized and photographed with a Zeiss microscope ( M1 , Zeiss Axio Imager , Carl Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) using Axiovision Software ( Carl Zeiss ) . In vivo animal studies were performed with a subcutaneous ( ectopic ) implantation method 64 . Nude rats ( male , 14 – 16 weeks , Charles River Labs . ) were used for this study . In brief , under anesthesia ( isoflurane ) , the animals received a long incision on the skin of the hind limb , dissection of the skin and the gluteus muscle , exposure of the sciatic nerve , resection of the distal end of the CPN , and placing the dissected CPN on the fascia of the gluteus muscle beneath the skin . The proximal stump of CPN was embedded within the bioprinted muscle constructs ( 15 × 5 × 1 mm 3 ; Fig . 5h , i ) . The bioprinted muscle constructs were implanted in the subcutaneous space over the gluteal muscle , separated by fascia and subcutaneous tissue . Therefore , there was no direct contact between the implant and native gluteal muscle . There was no gross adhesion or contact with the native gluteal muscle at retrieval . © 201 6 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .
