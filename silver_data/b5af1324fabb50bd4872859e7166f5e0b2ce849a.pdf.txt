Inhibitors targeting these in - tegrins are being tested for their therapeutic potential . Material and Method : The extracellular regions of the αvβ3 , αvβ5 , αvβ6 , αvβ8 , the cytoplasmic domain of β3 , the αv - chain , and the ECM molecules fibronectin and fibrinogen were studied immunohistochemically in a series of 122 carcinoma and 60 melanomas metastatic to the central nervous system . In addition , 38 matched primary and metastatic tumors to the brain were compared directly . Results : The αv - subunit was generally moderately to highly expressed in most tumors . αvβ3 and cytoplasmic β3 were weakly to moderately detectable in metastatic renal cell carcinomas and melanomas , αvβ5 was prominently expressed in metastatic renal and colorectal carcinomas , αvβ6 was most abundantly detectable in metastatic lung adenocarcinomas , but absent in melanomas . The tumor associated vessels in CNS metastases consistently ex - pressed αvβ3 , αvβ5 , αv - , fibronectin and fibrinogen , however , mostly at low levels , while αvβ6 , αvβ8 were lacking in vasculature . The comparative analysis of 38 matched primary tumors and brain metastases showed compa - rable levels of expression only for αvβ3 and αvβ8 , while αvβ6 and αvβ5 were higher in primaries . Conclusion : We confirmed that integrin expression exhibits considerable heterogeneity according to tumor origin . αvβ5 is the most promising target for integrin targeted treatment in brain metastases . Keywords : Integrins , metastases , prognosis , alphav Introduction Brain metastases are tumors that originate outside the central nervous system and after initial local growth spread secondarily via blood vessels ( hematogenous dissemination ) [ 1 ] . Metastases are the most common brain tumors , with incidence up to 11 per 100 . 000 population per year . Some 25 % of cancer vic - tims present brain metastases at autopsy [ 2 ] . The most common tumor origin of the brain metastases is lung , followed by carcinomas of the breast and genitourinary tract . Treatment for brain metastases is primarily palliative , with the goals of therapy being reduction of symp - toms and prolongation of life . Prognosis is usu - ally very poor [ 3 ] . Patients with brain metasta - ses survive 2 . 3 - 7 . 1 months on average , depending on tumor location , and the patients’ age and Karnofsky status [ 4 ] . Extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins are involved in tissue morphogenesis and tumor metastasis [ 5 ] . In coordination with the integrin family of ECM receptor present as heterodimers on the cell surface , they regulate adhesion , growth , cell movement , and survival . Alterations in inte - grin expression accompany and may contribute to the ability of cancer cells to cross physiologi - cal barriers in their tissue of origin and allow them to invade other structures [ 6 ] . Of interest here are the αv integrin subfamily , which has αvβ integrins in metastases 2720 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2013 ; 6 ( 12 ) : 2719 - 2732 five members αvβ1 , αvβ3 , αvβ5 , αvβ6 and αvβ8 . The αv family binds ECM components of the provisional ECM containing Arginine - Glycine - Aspartic Acid attachment sites ( eg . vit - ronectin , fibronectin , osteopontin and fibrino - gen ) [ 7 ] and αvβ6 and αvβ8 have also been associated with the local activation of pre TGFbeta [ 8 ] . Especial - ly αvβ3 and αvβ5 integ - rins , which are frequently expressed in tumor endothelia and in some tumor cells , may affect tumor initiation and progression [ 9 ] , while in lung cancer αvβ3 and αvβ6 can bind ligands such as osteopontin and fibronectin [ 9 ] . Tumor progression in colorectal cancer can apparent - ly be promoted through αvβ6 - mediated activa - tion of TGF - beta [ 10 ] . In pancreatic ductal ade - nocarcinoma αvβ6 is upregulated compared to normal ducts [ 11 ] . New treatment modalities against integrin sub - units are being developed and integrin ligands are also being exploited as diagnostic probes [ 12 , 13 ] , however , the analysis of integrins in tissues has been hampered by lack of antibod - ies suitable for use in paraffin embedded mate - rial . Recently one of us ( SLG ) has generated monoclonal antibodies against alpha - v integrin complexed to beta3 , beta5 , beta6 and beta8 in paraffin embedded archival tissue [ 14 ] and these have been successfully used to analyze brain tumors [ 15 ] . We used these antibodies to investigate integrin expression in a series of formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded brain metas - tases from lung , breast , kidney and prostate , from melanomas and from some other rare car - cinomas . In a subset we compared this expres - Table 1 .

Materials and methods Antibody generation Matched recombinant rabbit monoclonal anti - bodies ( RabMabs ) directed against intact extra - cellular domains of human αvβ3 , αvβ5 , αvβ6 , αvβ8 , complexes , of the common αv and the β3 - cytoplasmic domain ( detailed overview : Table 1 ) were generated and characterized as described previously [ 14 ] . Antibodies for the ligands fibronectin and fibrinogen were obtained commercially ( for supplier see Table 1 ) . Tissue samples Tumor samples were retrieved from the archives of Neuropathology at the Department of Path - ology and Neuropathology Tübingen and con - sisted of 182 tumors of which 175 were brain metastases and 7 intramedullary spinal cord metastases . In 38 cases , the matched primary tumor of origin was available ( see Table 2 ) . Tissue selection was performed according to the ethical guidelines of the University of Tuebingen using a protocol approved by the ethics committee ( Permission number : 249 / 2010BO1 ) . Histopathological designation and grading were done by at least two patholo - gists . Cases with divergent diagnoses and extradural location were not included . Details on these cases are shown in Table 2 . Tumors were available as tissue microarrays ( in 98 cases , two 1000 µm - diameter representative tissue punches from each tumor ) and as full slides ( in 84 cases , including all tumor prima - ries ) . The blocks were cut with a microtome ( 4 mM thick sections ) and placed on SuperFrost Plus slides ( Microm International , Walldorf , Germany ) for histochemistry . Immunohistochemistry After deparaffinization stains were performed on formalin - fixed paraffin embedded full - slide tissue sections and microarrays on an automat - ed immunohistochemistry system ( Ventana Benchmark , Roche , Strasbourg , France ) , [ 14 , 15 ] . This system uses an indirect biotin - avidin system and an universal biotinylated immuno - globulin secondary antibody and diaminobenzi - dine as chromogen . To enhance signal strength , tissue sections were incubated with a copper enhancer ( Ventana ) and counterstained with haematoxylin . Protocols details are summa - rized in Table 1 . Positive controls as previously established [ 14 ] included normal kidney for αvβ3 , αvβ5 and cytoβ3 , HT - 29 colon carcinoma cell line for αvβ6 , human CNS for αvβ8 and nor - mal colon tissue for the αv - chain . Positive con - trols for fibronectin and fibrinogen included clear - cell renal carcinoma and glioblastoma samples [ 15 ] . Negative control slides were pro - cessed in parallel with each batch of staining by replacing the primary antibody with the appropriate rabbit or murine polyclonal IgG iso - type control ( Genetex , San Antonio , TX , USA ) at the same concentrations of IgG primary antibodies . Data analysis and statistical evaluation Stained slides ( both full slides and TMA cores ) were scored manually as described previously [ 15 ] . Expression of integrins in vessels was semi - quantitatively recorded as : 0 ( staining absent ) , 1 ( staining in less than 50 % of vessels ) and 2 ( staining in 50 % or more vessels ) . Cytoplasmic and membranous expression in epithelial tumor cells was recorded together as staining intensity ( SI ) : 0 ( absent ) , 1 + ( weak expression ) , 2 + ( moderate expression ) and 3 + ( strong expression ) . In addition the number of epithelial and stromal cells with integrin stain - ing in tumors ( parenchymal positivity , PP ) was evaluated using a semi - quantitative score as 0 ( no staining , < 1 % positive cells ) , 1 ( 1 - 24 . 9 % positive cells ) , 2 ( 25 - 49 . 9 % ) , 3 ( 50 - 74 . 9 % ) , 4 ( 75 – 100 % ) . A calculated immunoreactive ( “IRS” ) score was generated by multiplying staining intensity score of tumor epithelial cells by the score of positive cells ( IRS = SI x PP : range 0 - 12 ) . In addition to this manual evalua - tion , stained TMA slides were scanned with a digital camera ( Sony , DFWX710 , Japan ) using the Mirax Scan software package ( Zeiss , Goettingen , Germany ) suite . Digitalized data were transferred to a workstation ( Definiens Tissue Studio , Munich , Germany ) . After select - ing randomly four tumor regions ( size of the window was determined by the software ) on the digitalized TMA punches to be used for soft - ware training , staining thresholds for nucleus detection and quantitative membrane and cytoplasmic intensity were adjusted on the four selected subsets at 20 x magnification of the scanned TMA punch area until the software αvβ integrins in metastases 2722 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2013 ; 6 ( 12 ) : 2719 - 2732 αvβ integrins in metastases 2723 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2013 ; 6 ( 12 ) : 2719 - 2732 test runs successfully recognized the nuclei and the calculated antibody staining intensity matched the pathologists’ assessment from manual analysis . The subsets were selected according to their overall staining ( strong , mod - erate , weak or absent staining ) . The histoscore was calculated on the basis of the formula ( [ percentage weak staining cells x 1 ] + [ per - centage moderately stained cells x 2 ] + [ per - centage strongly stained cells x 3 ] = histoscore . Possible range : 0 - 300 ) which expresses pre - cisely the overall expression in a weighted man - Figure 1 .

Matched pairs analysis was used for analyzing comparative expression between metastases and primary tumors . Logistic fit was used for correlation between manual ( cal - culated immunoreactive score ) and automated evaluation ( calculated histoscore ) . In addition multivariate regression was performed for cor - relation of expression of each integrin ( based on calculated histoscore data ) . Results Staining patterns of integrin complexes in tumors examined Positive integrin immunostaining in all tumors examined was both membranous and cytoplas - mic ( for primaries and metastases ) . Memb - ranous αvβ5 and αvβ6 immunoreactivity was usually more prominent than cytoplasmic stain - ing , while for αvβ8 , αv - and fibronectin mem - branous and cytoplasmic staining was similar ( Figure 1 ) . αvβ8 and , with very few exceptions , αvβ6 staining were not found in tumor vessels , while immunoreactivity of αvβ5 , αv - , fibrinogen and fibronectin was also observed in tumor vessels . αvβ3 and cytoplasmic β3 was mainly detectable in vessels , however some tumor cells exhibited a weak additional cytoplasmic β3 staining ( see Figure 1 ) . No nuclear staining for integrins was observed . Immunoreactivity in tumor stroma was especially prominent for αvβ5 and present for αv - , while the tumor stro - ma was generally negative for αvβ3 , αvβ6 , αvβ8 and the cytoplasmic beta3 . Staining intensity of tumor stroma and tumor cells was often similar for fibrinogen and fibronectin ( Figure 2 ) . Manual evaluation of integrin expression Means and standard deviations of the quanti - tative immunoreactivity , the staining intensity and combined IRS results for each integrin complex in 122 carcinomas and 60 melano - mas metastatic to CNS grouped according to their histology are shown in Table 3 . In general , the αv - subunit was most prominently stained in carcinoma and melanoma tumor cells . While αvβ5 and αvβ6 were high and αvβ3 low immu - noreactive in adenocarcinomas , the opposite pattern was observed in clear cell carcinomas . Squamous cell and small cell carcinomas pre - dominantly stained for αvβ6 , while melanoma cells were immunoreactive for αvβ3 and αvβ5 . αvβ8 was rarely seen in epithelial and melano - cytic tumors .

The αv - subunit was generally highly to moderately immu - noreactive in most metasta - ses ( mean values from 12 to 6 . 8 ) . Fibrinogen ( mean score 0 . 6 ; SD 0 . 9 ) and fibronectin ( mean score 1 . 12 ; SD 2 . 1 ) were weakly stained in all CNS metastases . Manual evaluation integrin expression in tumor vessels of brain metastases Means and standard devia - tions of the staining intensity scores in tumor vessels for each integrin complex are shown in Figure 4 ( carcino - ma n = 120 , melanoma n = 39 ) . Analysis of tumor vascu - lature in carcinoma metasta - ses showed that staining in tumor vessels for αvβ3 ( mean : 1 . 52 , SD : 0 . 7 ) , cyto - plasmic β3 ( mean : 0 . 92 , SD : 0 . 8 ) , αvβ 5 ( mean : 1 . 30 , SD : 0 . 8 ) , was consistently pres - ent , while αvβ8 ( mean : 0 . 03 , SD : 0 . 2 ) and αvβ 6 ( mean : 0 . 2 , SD : 0 . 5 ) was almost absent in carcinoma tumor vessels . In melanoma metas - tases vascular αvβ3 ( mean : 0 . 6 , SD : 0 . 71 ) , cytoplasmic β3 expression ( mean : 0 . 73 , SD : 0 . 73 ) and αvβ 5 ( mean : 0 . 8 , SD : 0 . 8 ) was lower com - αvβ integrins in metastases 2727 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2013 ; 6 ( 12 ) : 2719 - 2732 respiratory tract ( 1 . 3 , p = 0 . 047 , Figure 2B ) . Likewise cytoβ3 immunostaining in vasculature of metastatic lung tumors ( mean : 0 . 68 ) was sig - nificantly lower compared to metastases of prostatic ( 1 . 6 ) and intestinal carcinomas ( 1 . 3 ) . αvβ5 immunopositivity in renal ( 1 . 6 ) , lung ( 1 . 5 ) and prostatic ( 1 . 4 ) cancer metastases was sig - nificantly higher than in metastatic breast can - cer ( 0 . 7 , p = 0 . 053 to 0 . 0003 ) . Staining of αvβ6 A significant cytoβ3 upregulation was observed for breast cancer metastases ( p = 0 . 002 ) and lung cancer metastases ( p < 0 . 001 ) .

N = number of tumors analyzed . and αvβ8 was generally weak in tumor vessels and did not differ between the groups . Fibronectin ( mean score 1 . 5 ; SD 0 . 7 ) and fibrinogen ( mean : 1 . 3 ; SD : 0 . 8 ) were weakly to moder - ately immunopositive in tumor associated vessels . Comparison of manual staining of primary and metastatic tumors Matched pairs of primary and their CNS metastatic tumors were available in 38 carcinoma samples . Statis - tical analysis showed that the expression in primary tumor and corresponding metastases were signifi - cantly correlated only for αvβ3 ( p = 0 . 0016 ) and αvβ8 ( p = 0 . 048 ) . No signifi - cant correlations were seen for cytoβ3 ( p = 0 . 25 ) , αvβ5 ( p = 0 . 076 ) , αvβ6 ( p = 0 . 27 ) , αv - ( p = 0 . 31 ) , fibrinogen ( p = 0 . 29 ) or fibronectin ( p = 0 . 78 ) indicating a different expression between prima - ry tumor and metastases . No significant association was observed in vascular expression of primary and metastatic tumors for αvβ3 ( p = 0 . 15 ) and αvβ5 ( p = 0 . 61 ) . After separation by tumor origin the matched pair analysis showed signifi - cant upregulation in αvβ3 ( p = 0 . 04 ) and downregula - tion of αvβ6 ( p = 0 . 0076 ) in kidney cancer metastases . αvβ integrins in metastases 2728 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2013 ; 6 ( 12 ) : 2719 - 2732 metastases with patients sex was observed for the integrins examined . In carcinomas there was a decrease of αvβ3 , cytoplasmic β3 , αvβ5 , αvβ6 , αvβ8 and αv - IRS values with a age , but results were not statisti - cally significant . In melanoma metastases a significant increase of cytoplasmic β3 ( p = 0 . 043 ) and αv - ( p < 0 . 0001 ) with age was observed , while IRS for αvβ3 , αvβ5 , αvβ6 and αvβ8 remained constant . IRS values were inde - pendent of tumor differentiation grade ( undif - ferentiated , moderately differentiated , well dif - ferentiated ) . Mean αvβ3 IRS scores were significant higher in spinal metastases ( p = 0 . 0031 , mean : 3 . 0 , SD : 0 . 7 ) compared to brain metastases ( 1 . 62 , SD 2 . 3 ) , while mean αvβ8 IRS scores in spinal metastases were signifi - cant lower ( p = 0 . 0017 , mean : 0 . 2 , SD : 0 . 4 ) compared to αvβ8 IRS in the brain metastases ( mean : 1 . 18 , SD : 2 . 5 ) . Mean IRS scores for αvβ3 , αvβ5 and αvβ6 were not significantly dif - ferent between brain and spinal metastases . Correlation automatic analysis and manual evaluation 38 carcinoma samples were available as tissue microarray ( TMA ) and evaluated with the Definiens software package . Results of the cal - culated histoscores for the integrin complexes are displayed as scatter plots in Figure 6 . Logistic fit of manual staining immunoreactive score with calculated histoscore from automat - ed analysis showed significant correlation of manual and automatic analysis for αvβ3 ( p = 0 . 0008 ) , cytoplasmic β3 ( p = 0 . 0153 ) , αvβ8 ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , αvβ6 ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , αvβ5 ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , αv - ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , fibrinogen ( p = 0 . 0001 ) expression , while results for fibronectin ( p = 0 . 285 ) were not significant . Possible factors influencing diverging results for fibronectin were expression in tumor vessels and necrotic areas which could not be completely excluded from the automatic analysis . Discussion This study aimed to characterize integrin expression profile in brain metastases , com - pared to the primary tumors of origin . While integrins in primary tumors have been already extensively studied , data on integrin expres - sion in CNS metastases and its relationship to the primary tumors is very limited , and based mainly on analysis of frozen tissue samples of breast carcinoma and lung carcinoma metasta - ses [ 16 ] . We used newly developed anti - integ - rin antibodies which are suitable for formalin - fixed paraffin - embedded tissues and investi - gated a series of carcinomas and melanomas metastatic to the brain and spinal cord . In addi - tion we compared the expression of integrins and ligands in brain metastases and in their primaries in a smaller subset of these tumors . All antibodies showed a robust and reproduc - ible staining in FFPE tissue , the signal was always unambiguously interpretable . All integ - rin subunits were found in carcinoma tissues , but showed different expression patterns ( membranous , cytoplasmic and in tumor ves - sels ) and levels of expression dependent on tumor origin and tumor histologic type . As with our previous results in gliomas , αvβ6 expres - sion was absent in CNS melanomas [ 15 ] , while all other integrin complexes and ligands were expressed , with strongest expression of αvβ5 . In CNS carcinoma metastases , the expression was strongest for αvβ5 , αvβ6 and αv - , whereas expression of αvβ8 , αvβ3 , cytoplasmic β3 , and of fibrinogen and fibronectin was rather weak . αvβ3 and cytoβ3 were restricted in many cases to tumor vessels only . This is in contrast with the overall staining results of brain tumors , where αvβ8 expression was homogeneously strong and αvβ6 was absent [ 15 ] . We found negligible expression of integrin αvβ3 in carcinoma metastases in CNS , with the exception of renal carcinoma metastases . There is only one report of αvβ3 being detect - able in renal cell carcinoma tumor cells , how - ever this was only in a small series [ 17 ] . The potential for αvβ3 integrin expression in renal cancer to promote growth or affect metastatic competence to CNS , is an interesting aspect for future study . It has been shown that αvβ3 expression in breast carcinoma can affect metastasis to brain [ 36 ] . In melanomas , tumors with increased αvβ3 expression tend to metas - tasize predominantly into the brain [ 18 ] . Our observation that 62 % of CNS melanoma metas - tases had αvβ3 immunopositive tumor cells supports this notion . In general the distribution of αvβ3 in human tumors is still incompletely characterized . αvβ3 is reported to be overex - pressed in glioblastomas ( 13 / 15 ) , melanomas ( 17 / 31 ) , ovarian cancer ( 23 / 31 ) and renal cell αvβ integrins in metastases 2729 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2013 ; 6 ( 12 ) : 2719 - 2732 carcinomas ( 52 / 65 ) [ 16 , 19 - 21 ] . In metastatic tumors , αvβ3 expression has been reported to be upregulated in 47 % of lymph node metasta - ses of prostate cancers [ 22 ] , in 71 % of renal cell carcinoma metastases , including CNS metastases [ 20 ] , in 58 % of metastatic mela - noma [ 19 ] . αvβ3 has been described in 60 % breast cancer CNS metastases and in 56 % of lung cancer CNS metastases , but we note that the majority of the samples described con - tained only scattered positive cells [ 16 ] . Given the fact , that αvβ3 was detectable only at low levels in most of the CNS carcinomas metasta - ses we have examined ; it may not be a general factor for promoting CNS colonization of breast , colorectal , lung and prostate cancers , while high αvβ3 expression in melanomas and renal cell carcinomas probably indicate a functional role in primary tumor parenchyma . Similarly to our results in gliomas , we observed differences in expression between αvβ3 and its cytoplas - mic domain β3 , that may reflect different affin - ity of the antibodies or total as opposed to acti - vated / ligated integrin αvβ3 [ 15 ] . We recently observed that vascular upregula - tion of αvβ3 in astrocytomas is associated with shorter survival [ 15 ] . In that study we found in general a moderate αvβ3 and cytoβ3 expres - sion in tumor associated vessels in glioblasto - mas , which is comparable to the vascular expression of these integrins in most brain metastases investigated by us ( e . g . melanoma , breast , colorectal and lung cancer ) , here the upregulation of vascular αvβ3 seems to be a common event in highly malignant primary and secondary CNS neoplasms . Integrin αvβ5 may influence adhesion of circu - lating tumor cells to vessel walls [ 23 ] . Our find - ings of high αvβ5 expression in CNS metasta - ses of melanomas , colorectal , prostate , renal and in some lung carcinomas , points to a pos - sible role in extravasation , outgrowth or even vascular cooption of metastatic tumor cells , a phenomenon known in brain metastases [ 24 ] . αvβ5 seems to be more widely expressed in human tumors than αvβ3 . Expression of αvβ5 has been reported for 69 % lymph node metas - tases of squamous cell carcinomas of the lung , compared to only 10 % cases having such immunopositivity for αvβ3 [ 25 ] . In oral head and neck squamous cell carcinomas , αvβ5 was more frequently observed than αvβ3 [ 26 ] . αvβ5 was reported in colon carcinoma in 50 % of the cases [ 27 ] . In renal cell carcinoma αvβ5 was found in 4 / 5 cases and αvβ3 in 4 / 7 cases [ 18 ] . αvβ5 was detected in frozen specimens of 6 / 7 lung tumors and 3 / 10 breast tumors metastat - ic to CNS [ 16 ] . There is evidence that αvβ5 has a significant role in tumor progression , which can be blocked by specific inhibitors , e . g . in lung cancer models [ 29 , 30 ] . Blockade inhibits not only angiogenesis , but also inhibited trans - forming growth factor - β - controlled malignant growth in a glioblastoma model [ 30 ] . The αvβ3 and αvβ5 inhibitor cilengitide reduced tumor progression of experimental breast cancer metastases [ 31 ] . Vascular αvβ5 has also been reported in previ - ous studies on brain tumors [ 15 , 30 ] . In our CNS metastases , vascular αvβ5 was detect - able at similar prevalence as vascular αvβ3 . αvβ6 is an epithelial - specific integrin in cancer , with highest expression levels reported in carci - noma of the liver , pancreas and ovary [ 32 ] . In carcinomas , αvβ6 may influence the activation of TGFb1 and 3 [ 33 ] . The CNS metastases in our study exhibited considerable heterogeneity of αvβ6 expression . Metastatic lung adenocar - cinomas , colorectal carcinomas and some breast carcinomas showed high expression , while αvβ6 was hardly detectable in neuroen - docrine lung carcinomas , prostate or renal car - cinomas , and was absent in melanomas . To our knowledge αvβ6 expression in primary kidney and prostate neoplasms has not been previously reported . In primary colorectal carci - nomas Yang et al reported αvβ6 in 34 % of the cases [ 34 ] . We detected αvβ6 in a higher pro - portion ( 63 % ) of metastatic colorectal metasta - ses , but overall αvβ6 in CNS metastases was more weakly immunopositive in metastatic tumors compared to their primary tumors . Arihiro et al reported αvβ6 in 18 % of their breast cancer cohort [ 35 ] , while 69 % of our CNS breast metastases were αvβ6 positive . Whether these differences in the αvβ6 expres - sion between primaries and metastatic can - cers are of biological significance , should be addressed in further comparative studies . In most carcinomas , we did not observe expres - sion of αvβ8 . Tumors of the kidney expressed αvβ8 but at low levels compared to primary brain tumors [ 15 ] . To our knowledge there are no previous reports concerning αvβ8 in carci - αvβ integrins in metastases 2730 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2013 ; 6 ( 12 ) : 2719 - 2732 nomas and melanomas . Our findings indicate that αvβ8 may be an immunohistochemical marker of CNS tumors , but possibly has little significance for the biology of brain meta - stases . Brain metastases are routinely operated on in high volume centers , which gather patients from a large catchment area . The primary tumors have been mostly resected in external hospitals . Thus primary tumor tissues are usu - ally not available for research studies . Never - theless we collected 38 carcinoma primaries to our series of CNS metastases . Our results showed unexpectedly , that the expression lev - els of the αv integrins and some relevant ligands correlated only for αvβ3 and αvβ8 between primary tumors and brain metasta - ses , showing a rather faint association even in these cases . All other integrins and ligands were detected at different levels in primary tumors compared to their metastases . If our still rather small sample of comparative data are representative for the regulation of the inte - grins in these tumor types , one has to assume that the regulation of integrin expression in metastatic tumor cells is influenced strongly by tumor microenvironment , or that specific com - petent cohorts disperse from the primary tumor and are selected by the metastatic sites . It remains to be established whether for a given patient , the metastases at each dispersion site will have a similar integrin profile , which would provide a molecular basis for the soil - and - seed hypothesis [ 37 ] . If we assess the changes in expression of a particular integrin by tumor ori - gin no clear trends are visible . Some changes appear to be relevant , however , the expression levels are either too low ( e . g . cytoβ3 in breast or lung cancers ) or the number of cases are small . Therefore such results have to be inter - preted with caution . Clearly , larger studies assessing more homogeneous cohorts and potentially , metastases to different sites are needed . Currently , several integrin inhibitors are under clinical development , and promising results have shown in some primary tumors of brain metastases such as melanoma and lung cancer [ 12 , 38 , 39 ] . As there is a relevant expression of αv - integrins in many human brain metastasis cases , clinical trials investi - gating the potential of integrin inhibitors for treatment of brain metastases seem warr - anted . In summary , there is considerable av - integrin expression in brain metastases , where αvβ 5 and αvβ 6 are most prominently detectable in carcinomas and αvβ5 and αvβ3 most promi - nently in melanomas ; whereas tumor associat - ed vessels constantly exhibit αvβ3 , αvβ5 , αv , and the ligands fibrinogen and fibronectin mostly at low levels . Metastatic carcinomas of different subtypes show considerable hetero - geneity in their integrin expression profiles . Because the best investigated integrins and ligands were detected at different levels in pri - mary tumor and their CNS metastases , it seems that the tumor microenvironment influ - ences integrin expression on tumors .
