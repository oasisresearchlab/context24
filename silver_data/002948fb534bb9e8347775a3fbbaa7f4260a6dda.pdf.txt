A FRET sensor of C - terminal movement reveals VRAC activation by plasma membrane DAG signaling rather than ionic strength Benjamin Ko¨nig 1 , Yuchen Hao 2 , 3 , 4 , Sophia Schwartz 1 , Andrew JR Plested 2 , 3 , 4 , Tobias Stauber 1 * 1 Institute of Chemistry and Biochemistry , Freie Universita¨t Berlin , Berlin , Germany ; 2 Institute of Biology , Humboldt Universita¨t zu Berlin , Berlin , Germany ; 3 Leibniz Forschungsinstitut fu¨r Molekulare Pharmakologie ( FMP ) , Berlin , Germany ; 4 NeuroCure , Charite´ Universita¨tsmedizin , Berlin , Germany Abstract Volume - regulated anion channels ( VRACs ) are central to cell volume regulation . Recently identified as hetero - hexamers formed by LRRC8 proteins , their activation mechanism remains elusive . Here , we measured Fo¨rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) between fluorescent proteins fused to the C - termini of LRRC8 subunits . Inter - subunit FRET from LRRC8 complexes tracked VRAC activation . With patch - clamp fluorometry , we confirmed that the cytoplasmic domains rearrange during VRAC opening . With these FRET reporters , we determined VRAC activation , non - invasively , in live cells and their subcompartments . Reduced intracellular ionic strength did not directly activate VRACs , and VRACs were not activated on endomembranes . Instead , pharmacological manipulation of diacylglycerol ( DAG ) , and protein kinase D ( PKD ) activity , activated or inhibited plasma membrane - localized VRACs . Finally , we resolved previous contradictory reports concerning VRAC activation , using FRET to detect robust activation by PMA that was absent during whole - cell patch clamp . Overall , non - invasive VRAC measurement by FRET is an essential tool for unraveling its activation mechanism .

Volume - regulated anion channels ( VRACs ) are ubiquitously expressed and involved in regulatory volume decrease ( RVD ) of vertebrate cells ( Chen et al . , 2019 ; Jentsch , 2016 ; Stauber , 2015 ) . These channels open slowly following osmotic cell swelling and mediate the extru - sion of chloride and organic osmolytes , leading to the efflux of water and hence cell shrinkage . VRACs are composed of LRRC8 heteromers containing the essential subunit LRRC8A and at least one other LRRC8 protein , LRRC8B - E ( Qiu et al . , 2014 ; Voss et al . , 2014 ) . The subunit composition determines various biophysical properties and substrate permeability ( Planells - Cases et al . , 2015 ; Syeda et al . , 2016 ; Voss et al . , 2014 ) . Although unlikely to be of physiological relevance , LRRC8A homomers can form anion channels , but with weak volume - sensitivity and very low conductance ( Deneka et al . , 2018 ; Syeda et al . , 2016 ; Yamada and Strange , 2018 ) . LRRC8 proteins form hex - amers with the N - terminal halves of the six LRRC8 proteins constituting the transmembrane domain of the channel complex with a single pore . The C - terminal halves contain at least 16 leucine - rich repeats that form horseshoe - like structures reaching into the cytoplasm and their apparent flexibility Ko¨nig et al . eLife 2019 ; 8 : e45421 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 45421 1 of 20 RESEARCH ARTICLE has been hypothesized to be related to channel gating ( Deneka et al . , 2018 ; Kasuya et al . , 2018 ; Kefauver et al . , 2018 ; Kern et al . , 2019 ) . Prior to cloning , the biophysical properties of VRAC - mediated chloride currents ( I Cl , swell ) and osmolyte conductance were studied extensively using mainly electrophysiological and pharmacologi - cal methods ( Ko¨nig and Stauber , 2019 ; Pedersen et al . , 2016 ; Strange et al . , 2019 ) ; but their acti - vation mechanism remained enigmatic for decades , in the absence of an unequivocal molecular identity for the channel . Numerous studies proposed contributions from membrane tension , the actin cytoskeleton and signaling pathways involving reactive oxygen species , calcium , G - proteins and phosphorylation cascades ( Akita and Okada , 2014 ; Chen et al . , 2019 ; Pedersen et al . , 2016 ) . Notably , the reduction of intracellular ionic strength ( G i ) was reported to be crucial for VRAC activa - tion upon osmotic cell swelling ( Voets et al . , 1999 ) and reconstituted LRRC8 complexes in lipid bilayers could indeed be activated by low ionic strength ( Syeda et al . , 2016 ) . However , VRACs can also be activated under iso - osmotic conditions that are unlikely to encompass any changes in G i ( Pedersen et al . , 2016 ; Strange et al . , 2019 ) . Here , we use intra - complex Fo¨rster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) to monitor VRAC activity in a spatio - temporal manner . This method demonstrates movement of the LRRC8 C - termini and pro - vides insights into the activation mechanism of VRACs . Results Inter - subunit FRET shows C - terminal movement during VRAC activation Following the hypothesis of a conformational rearrangement of the LRRC8 C - terminal domains dur - ing VRAC activation , we aimed to monitor VRAC activity by inter - subunit FRET ( Figure 1A ) . We first used acceptor photo - bleaching to test for FRET between cyan - and yellow - fluorescent proteins ( CFP / YFP ) fused to the C - termini of VRAC subunits . In HeLa cells co - expressing CFP - and YFP tagged LRRC8A ( A - CFP / A - YFP ) , bleaching of YFP ( the FRET acceptor ) robustly increased the inten - sity of CFP ( the FRET donor ) , compared to unbleached cells in the same field of view ( Figure 1B , C ) . The same was observed when LRRC8A was combined with the VRAC subunit LRRC8E ( A - CFP / E - YFP or A - YFP / E - CFP ) , but not when combined with plasma membrane - localized CD4 - YFP , used as con - trol for FRET by membrane crowding ( Figure 1C ) . Therefore , irrespective of VRAC subunit composi - tion , the C - termini are within FRET distance for the fluorescent protein adjuncts ( ~ 5 nm ) . Next , we explored whether FRET changes during VRAC activation . We used sensitized - emission FRET and monitored the corrected FRET ( cFRET , see Materials and methods ) values in HeLa cells expressing A - CFP / E - YFP ( Figure 1D ) . Switching from isotonic ( 340 mOsm ) to hypotonic ( 250 mOsm ) buffer led to a robust decrease in cFRET by 5 – 10 % within 90 s in both HeLa and HEK293 cells ( Figure 1E ) . In contrast , the intra - molecular cFRET of a cytosolic tandem FRET pair construct , CFP - 18aa - YFP ( Elder et al . , 2009 ) , and of a plasma membrane - localized ionotropic glutamate receptor ( Zachariassen et al . , 2016 ) were unaffected by hypotonic buffer ( Figure 1E , Figure 1—figure sup - plement 1 ) . These observations rule out FRET artifacts from changes of osmolarity or ion concentra - tions . To better understand the cFRET changes with the activation of VRAC , we expressed fluorescently - labelled A - CFP / E - YFP ( in this case Cerulean / Venus , see Materials and methods ) in HEK293 cells deficient for all five LRRC8 genes ( HEK293 KO ) ( Lutter et al . , 2017 ) and monitored cFRET and whole - cell currents simultaneously using patch - clamp fluorometry ( Zheng and Zagotta , 2003 ) . The kinetics of the cFRET drop and its reversibility correlated with the activation and inactiva - tion of hypotonicity - induced VRAC - mediated anion currents ( Figure 1F ) , demonstrating that the cFRET decrease indeed reflects VRAC opening . The current was in addition to any potential residual activity at isotonicity due to the fluorescent tags ( Gaita´n - Pen˜as et al . , 2016 ) . A progressive decrease in cFRET accompanied additional hypotonicity but , again mirroring VRAC , cFRET did not increase with hypertonic treatment ( Figure 1G , Figure 1—figure supplement 2A ) . We frequently observed varying extents of intracellular retention of LRRC8A or LRRC8E . We did not see a correlation between intensity of CFP or YFP and absolute cFRET values ( not shown ) , neither did relative changes in cFRET depend on the A - CFP / E - YFP expression ratio ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B ) . Remark - ably , cFRET also decreased for A - CFP / A - YFP constructs ( Figure 1E , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , providing evidence for activation of homomeric LRRC8A complexes in a cellular context .

DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 45421 3 of 20 Research article Cell Biology Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics Overall , these cFRET measurements show that the C - termini of LRRC8 proteins in VRAC com - plexes rearrange during activation and that this can be exploited to monitor their activity in living cells via FRET microscopy . Reduced ionic strength does not activate VRAC on endomembranes Reduced ionic strength is sufficient to activate reconstituted VRACs in lipid bilayer droplets ( Syeda et al . , 2016 ) . To measure intracellular ionic strength , we used a FRET - based sensor that reports the electrostatic attraction between arginine and aspartate residues in opposed a - helices ( ‘RD’ sensor ) ( Liu et al . , 2017 ) . As expected , this sensor indicated a reversible decrease in G i in HeLa cells during hypotonic treatment ( Figure 2A ) . Notably , the decrease was homogeneous over the entire cell volume ( Figure 2B , Figure 2—video 1 ) . If a decline in G i were sufficient to activate VRAC , then we hypothesized that it should already do so in the secretory pathway . To test for this , we trapped FRET - endowed VRACs in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) by treatment with brefeldin - A ( BFA ) during expression ( Figure 2C ) . FRET and hence complex formation in the ER of A - CFP / E - YFP ( but not A - CFP / CD4 - YFP ) was confirmed by acceptor bleaching ( Figure 1C ) . However , ER - trapped VRACs surprisingly did not respond to hypotonic treatment ( Figure 2D ) . This was likely not due to incomplete glycosylation since mutation of the LRRC8A N - glycosylation sites ( Voss et al . , 2014 ) did not impinge on the activation - dependent cFRET drop at the plasma membrane ( Figure 2D ) . Intrigued by this finding , we set out to follow VRACs along the secretory pathway . To this end , we exploited a reverse aggregation system and fused two self - dimerizing mutated FK506 - binding protein ( FM ) domains ( Rollins et al . , 2000 ) to the C - terminus of A - CFP . Inter - molecular dimerization of FM domains should lead to aggregation of VRACs in the ER , and upon addition of D / D solubilizer they should disaggregate and travel in bulk along the secretory route to the plasma membrane ( Figure 3A ) . Indeed , initially aggregated A - CFP - FM2 expressed alone ( Figure 3B , Figure 3—video 1 ) or with E - YFP ( not shown ) spread homogenously over the ER within 10 min in presence of D / D solubilizer , peaked in the Golgi apparatus at 80 min and displayed clear plasma membrane localiza - tion after 165 min . Concurrent sensitized FRET measurements showed that neither ER - localized ( at 10 min ) nor Golgi - localized ( 80 min ) A - CFP - FM2 / E - YFP VRAC responded to application of hypotonic buffer . On the other hand , as expected , cFRET was reduced for A - CFP - FM2 / E - YFP that had reached the plasma membrane after 165 min ( Figure 3C ) . Thus , despite hypotonic treatment reducing G i homogenously over the whole cell , VRACs are only activated when they reach the plasma membrane . Robust VRAC activation by PMA is blocked by whole - cell patch clamp Next , we asked which plasma membrane - specific factors might be required for VRAC activation . First , we tested the influence of the actin cytoskeleton and cholesterol content , both of which have previously been implicated in cell volume regulation ( Byfield et al . , 2006 ; Klausen et al . , 2006 ) . In agreement with earlier reports on I Cl , swell in lymphocytes ( Levitan et al . , 1995 ) , depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton by latrunculin B did not alter VRAC activation by ~ 25 % hypotonicity ( Fig - ure 3—figure supplement 2A , B ) . In contrast , cholesterol depletion by methyl - b - cyclodextrin Figure 1 continued above in mOsm ) .

However , absence of cholesterol is unlikely to underlie plasma membrane localization as a prerequisite for VRAC activation , since the ER membrane usually has lower choles - terol concentrations than the plasma membrane .

PKC contains a C1 domain and can hence be activated by phorbol - 12 - myristate - 13 - acetate ( PMA ) . In isotonic conditions , PMA evoked a robust decrease in cFRET in HeLa and HEK293 cells expressing A - CFP / A - YFP or A - CFP / E - YFP ( Figure 4A ) , but not CFP - 18aa - YFP ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) . This reflects gating of the LRRC8 complex , because subsequent inactivation of VRAC by treat - ment with hyper - osmotic solution restored basal FRET levels ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) . Like hypotonicity - driven VRAC activation , activation by PMA required cell surface localization , as VRACs released from aggregation were immune to PMA in the ER and Golgi , but they were acti - vated at the plasma membrane ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1C ) .

To test whether this discrepancy was due to the absence of endogenous LRRC8 proteins , or to the dialysis of the cell contents during whole - cell patch , we first incubated HEK293 KO cells expressing A - CFP / E - YFP ( Figure 4C , left panel ) and wild - type ( WT ) HEK293 ( Figure 4C , right panel ) with PMA for at least five minutes before membrane breakthrough . We then established the whole - cell configuration for immediate current measurements . Indeed , with this experimental design we observed a reliable increase in classical VRAC currents in HEK293 KO cells expressing A - CFP / E - YFP incubated with PMA . The increase was robust compared to cells in isotonic buffer alone , or untransfected HEK293 KO cells incubated with PMA ( Figure 4C ) . This result demonstrates that the whole - cell voltage - clamp configuration affects signaling pathways involved in activation of VRAC in a time - dependent manner , an experimental caveat that can be overcome with our non - invasive FRET sensor . Protein kinase D activity , rather than ionic strength , determines VRAC activation Using the PKC inhibitor Go¨6983 not only prevented the cFRET reduction upon hypotonicity , it also gradually increased cFRET over the course of the experiment ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2A ) . However , in the whole - cell patch - clamp configuration , the hypotonicity - induced current even per - sisted in isotonic buffer when supplemented with Go¨6983 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2B , left panel ) . The cFRET of the same cells , on the other hand increased to high values ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2B , middle panel ) . Again , we observed different results for the cell being recorded in whole - cell mode and neighboring non - dialyzed cells in the same field of view ( FOV ) . For neighboring cells , cFRET changes matched those seen for HeLa cells expressing A - CFP / E - YFP ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2A , B , right panel ) . Together , these data do not support a role for PKC in VRAC activation . However , because DAG and PMA also recruit C1 domain - containing protein kinase D ( PKD ) to the plasma membrane ( Rozengurt , 2011 ) , we next assessed a possible involvement of PKD . The presence of the PKD inhibitor CRT 0066101 during hypotonic treatment abolished cFRET changes and strongly reduced VRAC currents in HEK293 KO cells expressing A - CFP / E - YFP ( Figure 5A ) . To exclude the potential confounder of cell dialysis during voltage clamp , we also measured steady - state currents in cells that were incubated in hypotonic buffer before membrane breakthrough , with and without CRT 0066101 or Go¨6983 . Similar to incubation during the whole - cell patch - clamp exper - iment , the presence of CRT 0066101 readily diminished currents following breakthrough after pre - incubation in hypotonic buffer , whereas Go¨6983 did not ( Figure 5B ) . This suggests an essential role of DAG - activated PKD in hypotonicity - induced VRAC activation . DAG is converted to phosphatidic acid by DAG kinases ( DGKs ) , and so inhibition of DGKs by dio - ctanoylglycol ( DOG ) should lead to accumulation of DAG . According to our hypothesis concerning PKD signaling , following VRAC activation by hypotonicity , DOG should support persistent activity of VRAC even after returning to isotonic conditions . Indeed , in the presence of DOG , we observed a persistent VRAC current after switching from extracellular hypotonicity to normal , isotonic buffer for A - CFP / E - YFP expressed in HEK293 KO cells ( Figure 5C , left panel , Figure 5—figure supplement 1A , left panel ) , as well as for endogenous VRAC in WT HEK293 cells ( Figure 5C , right panel , Fig - ure 5—figure supplement 1A , right panel ) . For the A - CFP / E - YFP VRAC expressed in either HEK293 KO cells in whole - cell patch clamp ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A , left panel ) and non - dialyzed HeLa cells ( Figure 5D , left panel , Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) the DGK inhibitor DOG impaired the recovery of cFRET to basal values when cells were returned to isotonicity after hypo - tonic treatment . While cFRET in HeLa cells without DOG recovered by > 80 % ( recovery of normalized cFRET from 95 . 2 ± 2 . 5 % in hypotonic buffer to 99 . 4 ± 4 . 0 % in isotonic buffer for 47 cells ) , cFRET in DOG - treated HeLa cells recovered by less than 40 % ( from 89 . 6 ± 8 . 0 % to 93 . 6 ± 5 . 9 % , for 9 cells ) . In striking contrast , G i fully recovered to the normal levels irrespective of the presence of DOG ( Figure 2A , Figure 5D , right panel ) . These results demonstrate that opening of VRACs is not directly coupled to G i , but rather to the DAG pathway , likely through activation of PKD in HeLa and HEK293 cells .

The relationship of the observed FRET changes to VRAC gating are clear from numerous common features ( Akita and Okada , 2014 ; Ko¨nig and Stauber , 2019 ; Pedersen et al . , 2016 ; Strange et al . , 2019 ) : ( i ) the reversible decrease in FRET matches reversible VRAC activation upon treatment with hypo - osmotic solutions , and with the same kinetics as simultaneously - measured whole - cell VRAC currents , ( ii ) the intensity of the FRET decrease correlates with the applied extracel - lular hypotonicity ; ( iii ) the modulation of VRAC currents , for example by cholesterol depletion , is mir - rored by the observed FRET alteration ; ( iv ) after activation with PMA , FRET rises in hypertonicity as VRAC is inactivated by cell shrinkage . FRET sensors unrelated to VRAC are not affected by hypo - osmotic solutions , demonstrating that the observed changes with our FRET sensor are indeed A B HEK KO A - CFP / E - YFP , whole - cell patch HEK KO A - CFP / E - YFP whole - cell patch after incubation VRAC activity ionic strength 0 . 7 0 . 9 1 . 1 1 . 3 1 . 5 1 . 7 - 1 . 0 - 0 . 8 - 0 . 6 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 200 400 600 800 1000 no r m a li z ed c F R E T c u rr en t [ n A ] time [ s ] currentFRET HeLa A - CFP / E - YFP , without whole - cell patch C D HEK , endogenous VRAC whole - cell patch HEK KO A - CFP / E - YFP whole - cell patch Iso Iso Hypo c u rr en t [ n A ] - 0 . 5 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 3 - 0 . 2 - 0 . 1 0 . 0 Hypo Hypo CRT 0066101 * - 3 . 0 - 2 . 5 - 2 . 0 - 1 . 5 - 1 . 0 - 0 . 5 0 . 0 Hypo Hypo CRT 0066101 Hypo Gö6983 Iso c u rr en t [ n A ] * c u rr en t r e c o v e r y [ % ] 0 20 40 60 80 100 * c u rr en t r e c o v e r y [ % ] 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 1 . 1 n . s . no r m a li z ed c F R E T Hypo DOG Iso DOG Hypo DOG Iso DOG * * * 0 . 9 1 . 0 1 . 1 1 . 2 no r m a li z ed F R E T / C e r u l ean 0 20 40 60 80 untreated DOG untreated DOG Figure 5 .

Moreover , our optical method to monitor VRAC activity has some clear advantages over electrophysiological approaches , including its application to study subcellular pro - files of VRAC activity , and its non - invasive nature . The activation of low - conducting VRACs com - posed of only LRRC8A ( Deneka et al . , 2018 ; Kefauver et al . , 2018 ; Syeda et al . , 2016 ; Yamada and Strange , 2018 ) could also be detected by FRET . Importantly , the non - invasive , geneti - cally - encoded FRET sensor enables the study of VRAC in connection with signaling pathways that are altered ( presumably by dialysis of critical signaling molecules ) by the whole - cell patch - clamp con - figuration . This way we could observe VRAC activation by PMA , which was otherwise blocked by whole - cell patch clamp of cells . Cryo - EM structures of VRAC complexes suggest a certain flexibility of their C - terminal leucine - rich domains ( LRRDs ) on the intracellular side . Related conformational rearrangements might be related to channel gating ( Deneka et al . , 2018 ; Kasuya et al . , 2018 ; Kefauver et al . , 2018 ; Kern et al . , 2019 ) . In support of this idea , we observe a decrease in FRET between fluorophores at the C - termini of LRRC8 proteins upon VRAC activation , which may reflect a displacement of LRRDs or possibly a simple change in the average orientation of the fluorophores to each other . Thus , as has previously been shown for cyclic nucleotide - gated ( CNG ) channels ( Zheng and Zagotta , 2000 ) , slow gating of CLC chloride channels ( Bykova et al . , 2006 ) , BK potassium channels ( Miranda et al . , 2013 ) and ionotropic glutamate receptors ( Zachariassen et al . , 2016 ) , changes in FRET demon - strate movement of the cytosolic domains during VRAC activation . VRACs were previously shown to be directly activated by low ionic strength in lipid bilayer recon - stitution ( Syeda et al . , 2016 ) . However , we find that reduced G i is neither sufficient to activate VRAC on intracellular compartments , nor is it indispensable to keep plasma membrane - localized VRACs active . When cells were treated with the DAG kinase inhibitor DOG , VRAC remained active in iso - tonic buffer after activation by hypotonicity , even though G i recovered to normal levels . The notion that ionic strength directly activates VRACs ( Sabirov et al . , 2000 ; Voets et al . , 1999 ) has been con - troversial ( Ko¨nig and Stauber , 2019 ; Strange et al . , 2019 ) . Several studies reported VRAC activa - tion when isotonic fluid was injected into , or inactivation when fluid was withdrawn from the cells without altering the intracellular ionic strength ( Best and Brown , 2009 ; Cannon et al . , 1998 ; Poletto Chaves and Varanda , 2008 ; Zhang and Lieberman , 1996 ) . Moreover , the extents of low ionic strength required for VRAC activation ( Cannon et al . , 1998 ; Deneka et al . , 2018 ; Nilius et al . , 1998 ; Syeda et al . , 2016 ) are unlikely to occur in physiological conditions or during whole - cell cur - rent measurements routinely used to study hypotonicity - induced VRAC currents ( Strange et al . , 2019 ) . Instead , a putative role for ionic strength in controlling the volume set point for VRAC activa - tion ( Best and Brown , 2009 ; Cannon et al . , 1998 ; Jackson et al . , 1996 ) would be consistent with our findings . Rather than ionic strength , we observe a specific and potent action of the DAG - PKD pathway in VRAC activation . Application of PMA led to VRAC opening even under isotonic conditions and VRACs did not inactivate completely in isotonic buffer after activation by hypotonicity when the con - sumption of DAG by DAG kinase was inhibited . A role for DAG , which is generated by the activity of phospholipases C ( PLCs ) , in the signaling for VRAC activation has been reported previously , for example ( Roman et al . , 1998 ; Rudkouskaya et al . , 2008 ; Zholos et al . , 2005 ) . However , there are multiple contradictory reports on the involvement of DAG - activated PKCs . In some studies , PKCs were shown to be required for regulatory volume decrease ( Hermoso et al . , 2004 ) , activation of swelling - induced VRAC currents ( Roman et al . , 1998 ) and ATP - induced VRAC - mediated gluta - mate release ( Hyzinski - Garcı´a et al . , 2014 ; Rudkouskaya et al . , 2008 ) . These results are somewhat compromised by variations in the efficacy of pharmacological PKC inhibitors ( Haskew - Layton et al . , 2005 ; Mongin and Kimelberg , 2005 ) . Other studies found no role for PKC despite a VRAC - activat - ing effect of DAG ( Zholos et al . , 2005 ) , or even reduction or prevention of hypotonicity - induced VRAC - mediated currents by pharmacological PKC inhibition ( Ben Soussia et al . , 2012 ; Shlyonsky et al . , 2011 ; von Weikersthal et al . , 1999 ) . While our data speak against a core role for PKC in VRAC activation , they do not rule out a regulatory role for this kinase family . Instead , our experiments reveal that protein kinase D ( PKD ) activity is critically involved in hypotonicity - induced activation of VRAC . LRRC8 proteins possess several putative and some confirmed phosphorylation sites for various kinases in their intracellular loops and C - terminal domains ( Abascal and Zardoya , 2012 ; Mongin , 2016 ) . As opposed to direct phosphorylation of LRRC8 subunits , PKD may act on another , as yet unknown , third party in the process of VRAC activation . Ko¨nig et al . eLife 2019 ; 8 : e45421 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 45421 10 of 20 Research article Cell Biology Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics The central role for DAG and PKD , however , does not explain the observed plasma membrane requirement for VRAC activation by hypotonicity as PKD is also recruited to endomembranes of the secretory pathway by DAG ( Baron and Malhotra , 2002 ; Fu and Rubin , 2011 ) . Plasma membrane - intrinsic properties such as membrane stiffness , the lipid composition , including the amount of cho - lesterol and different phosphatidylinositol phosphates ( PIPs ) , or the transmembrane potential may play a role . Besides , further limiting factors are likely to be involved , potentially explaining why the overexpression of functional LRRC8 heteromers does not increase I Cl , swell above wild - type levels ( Voss et al . , 2014 ) and similar VRAC subunit expression levels displayed different activities in differ - ent cell types ( Okada et al . , 2017 ) . Such limiting factors at the plasma membrane could include sub - strates of PKD . Although we also observed PMA - mediated activation of LRRC8A homomers , regulatory proteins could require particular VRAC subunit combinations to contribute to VRAC acti - vation . Alternatively , cell type - specific factors may exist , explaining inconsistent findings on the sig - nal transduction pathways impinging on VRAC activation . This could explain divergent results related to PKC in different cell lines ( Ben Soussia et al . , 2012 ; Hermoso et al . , 2004 ; Roman et al . , 1998 ; von Weikersthal et al . , 1999 ; Zholos et al . , 2005 ) . In summary , activation - dependent inter - subunit FRET in VRACs demonstrated movement of their C - termini and enabled subcellular monitoring of VRAC activity . Importantly , this noninvasive FRET sensor supersedes some aspects of electrophysiological measurements because it leaves intracellular signaling pathways untouched . Measurement of FRET can also be used for non - invasive structure - activity studies . The genetic encoding of this sensor also makes it highly amenable to studying VRAC activation during various cell physiological processes in situ .

Cerulean and Venus are also referred to as CFP and YFP throughout . For expression of CD4 - YFP , human CD4 was subcloned from CD4 - GFP ( Leisle et al . , 2011 ) into pEYFP - N3 . For the generation of A - CFP - FM 2 , two FM domains ( Rollins et al . , 2000 ) were inserted into XbaI - SpeI restriction sites 3’ of A - CFP Ko¨nig et al . eLife 2019 ; 8 : e45421 .

The FRET - based RD sensor for ionic strength ( Liu et al . , 2017 ) was kindly provided by B . Poolman and A . J . Boersma , CFP - 18AA - YFP ( Elder et al . , 2009 ) by C . F . Kaminski . The glutamate receptor construct GluA2 - 6Y - 10C has been described previously ( Zachariassen et al . , 2016 ) . For expression of GalNAcT2 - RFP , the stalk region of N - acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 ( GalNAcT2 ) was subcloned from pGalNAcT2 - GFP ( Le Bot et al . , 1998 ) into pmRFP - N1 . For expres - sion of ER - localized YFP ( ER - YFP ) , we used the plasmid pEYFP - ER ( Clontech ) . Cell lines HeLa ( RRID : CVCL _ 0030 ) and HEK293 ( RRID : CVCL _ 0045 ) cells were obtained from Leibniz For - schungsinstitut DSMZ and regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination . LRRC8 - / - HEK293 ( HEK293 KO ) cells deficient in all five LRRC8 subunits ( Lutter et al . , 2017 ) were kindly provided by T . J . Jentsch . Cells were grown in DMEM ( Pan - Biotech ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum at 37˚C in 5 % CO 2 . For imaging experiments without simultaneous electrophysiology , cells were plated in 35 mm glass bottom dishes ( MatTek ) , coated with poly - L - lysine 0 . 01 % solution ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for HEK293 cells . For electrophysiology , cells were plated on poly - L - lysine - coated 25 mm coverslips . Cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 ( Promega ) according to the supplier’s manual . For co - expres - sion , constructs were co - transfected at equimolar ratios . Drug treatment Brefeldin - A ( BFA , Sigma - Aldrich , 10 mg / ml in DMSO ) was added at 5 m g / ml to culture medium dur - ing transfection . To depolymerize the actin cytoskeleton , 2 m M latrunculin B ( Sigma - Aldrich , dis - solved in DMSO ) was added to the growth medium for 1 hr in normal growth conditions . For cholesterol depletion , 5 mM methyl - b - cyclodextrin ( MbCD , Sigma - Aldrich ) , dissolved in DMEM and stirred for 30 min at RT before sterile filtration , was applied for 1 hr in normal growth conditions . 1 m M phorbol - 12 - myristat - 13 - acetat ( PMA , Bio - Techne , dissolved in DMSO ) , 1 m M Go¨6983 ( Abcam , DMSO ) , 5 m M CRT 0066101 ( Bio - Techne , H 2 O ) and 100 m M dioctanoylglycol ( DOG , Bio - Techne , DMSO ) were added during or before measurements as indicated . Imaging of intracellular localization , actin cytoskeleton and cholesterol staining Images of the intracellular localization of LRRC8A - GFP / LRRC8E - RFP and of LRRC8A - CFP - FM 2 with the organelle markers ER - YFP , GalNAc - T2 - RFP and CD4 - YFP were acquired with a 64x / 1 . 4 oil objec - tive at a Leica Dmi8 microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu OcraFlash4 . 0 controlled by LAS X . Images of the actin cytoskeleton and cholesterol content were acquired with a 20x / 0 . 7 dry objective at the same microscope . For cholesterol staining , cells were washed with PBS , fixed with 4 % parafor - maldehyde ( PFA ) for 15 min at room temperature , washed with PBS and incubated with DMEM + 10 % FCS for 10 min at 37˚C , and , after washing with PBS , stained with 125 m g / ml filipin ( Sigma - Aldrich , dissolved in DMSO and diluted in PBS ) for 45 min at room temperature . After wash - ing with PBS , images were acquired with a DAPI filter set ( EX : 360 / 40 , DC : 400 , EM : 425 lp ) . To stain the actin cytoskeleton , PFA - fixed cells ( as above ) were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 in PBS + 1 % BSA for 5 min at room temperature and incubated with Alexa Fluor 546 - phalloidin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) diluted 1 : 1000 in PBS + 1 % BSA at room temperature for 1 hr , washed with PBS , air dried and mounted on glass cover slides for imaging with a rhodamine filter set ( EX : 540 / 23 , DC : 580 , EM : 590 lp ) . Cells co - expressing LRRC8A - CFP - FM 2 with organelle markers were fixed and mounted as described above 24 hr after transfection and incubation with D / D solubilizer for the indicated times . Images where acquired with filter sets for CFP ( EX : 436 / 20 , DC : 455 EM : 480 / 40 ) , YFP ( EX : 500 / 20 , DC : 515 , EM : 535 / 30 ) and rhodamine ( as above ) . Acceptor photo - bleaching , sensitized - emission and ratiometric FRET assays FRET experiments were performed on a high - speed setup of Leica Microsystems ( Dmi6000B stage , 63x / 1 . 4 objective , high speed external Leica filter wheels with Leica FRET set filters ( 11522073 ) , EL6000 light source , DFC360 FX camera , controlled by Las AF ) . All experiments were executed at Ko¨nig et al . eLife 2019 ; 8 : e45421 .

Isotonic imaging buffer ( 340 mOsm ) contained ( in mM ) : 150 NaCl , 6 KCl , 1 MgCl 2 , 1 . 5 CaCl 2 , 10 glucose , 10 HEPES , pH 7 . 4 . NaCl was adjusted for osmolarity titration in hypo - tonicity ; standard hypotonic buffer ( 250 mOsm ) contained 105 mM NaCl . Hypertonic buffers were as isotonic buffer supplemented with 60 mM ( for 400 mOsm ) or 160 mM ( for 500 mOsm ) mannitol . Acceptor bleaching experiments were conducted on field - of views ( FOVs ) with at least two cells expressing both fluorescent proteins . An image in both CFP and YFP channels was taken per time point . To bleach only part of the FOV , the field diaphragm was closed until control cells were no lon - ger illuminated . Cells were bleached with 515 – 560 nm light at full intensity ( Leica filter cube N2 . 1 ) for 2 . 5 – 5 min per time point until YFP signals reached below 10 % of initial intensity . Intensities of CFP and YFP for respective time points were measured in Fiji in background - subtracted images and the percentage change of CFP intensity calculated for bleached and control cells . Sensitized - emission FRET ( seFRET ) images were recorded with the same settings for donor , acceptor and FRET channels ( 8 (cid:2) 8 binning , 100 ms exposure , gain 1 ) every 10 – 20 s . Images were processed with Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . cFRET maps were calculated with PixFRET plugin ( Feige et al . , 2005 ) ( threshold set to 1 , Gaussian blur to 2 ) with a self - written macro to process mov - ies according to following equation ( Jiang and Sorkin , 2002 ) cFRET ¼ IDA (cid:0) IDD (cid:3) b (cid:0) IAA (cid:3) g IAA with emission intensities of I DA ( FRET channel ) , I DD ( donor channel ) , I AA ( acceptor channel ) . Cor - rection factors ( b = bleed through of donor emission ; g = cross excitation of acceptor by donor exci - tation ) were calculated from acceptor - and donor - only samples that were measured on three different days with at least three FOVs per day . cFRET maps were measured by manually - drawn regions of interest ( ROIs ) over whole cells , excluding intracellular aggregates that were oversatu - rated in any of the three channels . Because of the variability in absolute FRET values between indi - vidual cells , cFRET values of individual cells were normalized to their mean cFRET in isotonic buffer . For monitoring ionic strength in living cells , we used the ratiometric FRET - based RD sensor ( Liu et al . , 2017 ) . Sequential images of the CFP and FRET channels were acquired using the same fil - ters as for seFRET experiments every 10 s . Images were acquired with 2 (cid:2) 2 binning , 500 ms expo - sure , gain 3 . 0 and intensity four for hypotonicity experiments and with 8 (cid:2) 8 binning , 127 ms exposure , gain 3 . 0 and intensity two for DOG experiments . Ratio maps of I _ FRET / I _ Cerulean were created from background - subtracted images in Fiji and mean ratio values were taken from hand - drawn ROIs of individual cells . To account for ionic strength differences between individual cells , ratios were normalized to baseline values in isotonic buffer . Electrophysiology and simultaneous seFRET measurements For whole - cell patch - clamp recordings , the isotonic bath solution was composed as follows ( in mM ) : 150 NaCl , 6 KCl , 1 MgCl 2 , 1 . 5 CaCl 2 , 10 glucose , and 10 HEPES , pH 7 . 4 with NaOH ( 320 mOsm ) . We used an intracellular ( pipette ) solution with the following composition ( in mM ) : 40 CsCl , 100 Cs - methanesulfonate , 1 MgCl 2 , 1 . 9 CaCl 2 , 5 EGTA , 4 Na 2 ATP , and 10 HEPES , with pH adjusted to 7 . 2 with CsOH ( 290 mOsm ) . For VRAC activation , cells were perfused with drugs and / or a hypotonic buffer containing ( in mM ) 105 NaCl , 6 CsCl , 1 MgCl 2 , 1 . 5 CaCl 2 , 10 glucose , 10 HEPES , pH 7 . 4 with NaOH ( 240 mOsm ) . The osmolarities of all solutions were measured with a vapor pressure osmome - ter ( VAPRO 5600 , Elitech ) . Pipettes had a resistance of 3 – 5 M W when filled with intracellular solution , and we used ISO - type pipette holders ( G23 Instruments ) to minimize pipette drift . For cells overex - pressing exogenous , fluorescently - labelled VRAC constructs , the success rate for obtaining a giga - seal and whole - cell configuration were < 20 % , compared to > 50 % for wild - type untransfected HEK293 cells . Whole - cell recordings from cells overexpressing VRAC were also less stable . For nor - malizing current to cell capacitance , we used the capacitance from the manual compensation of tran - sients from the Axopatch 200B amplifier ( Molecular Devices ) . After whole - cell configuration was obtained , cells were held at – 30 mV and the currents were recorded using Axograph X ( Axograph Scientific ) via an Instrutech ITC - 18 D - A interface ( HEKA Elektronik ) . The standard protocol for VRAC current recordings consisted of 9 episodes of a 0 . 5 s step to – 80 mV every 12 s , followed by a 3 s voltage step protocol ( 300 ms steps to – 40 , 0 , 40 , 80 , 100 mV in turn ) . This protocol was repeated throughout the recording . The voltage - step protocol confirmed VRAC - typical properties of outward rectification and depolarization - dependent inactivation for LRRC8A / E - containing VRAC ( Ko¨nig and Ko¨nig et al . eLife 2019 ; 8 : e45421 . DOI : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 7554 / eLife . 45421 15 of 20 Research article Cell Biology Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics Stauber , 2019 ; Ullrich et al . , 2016 ; Voss et al . , 2014 ) . Excitation by 445 and 514 nm diode lasers ( iChrome MLE , Toptica Photonics ) for CFP and YFP was directed through a manual total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) input to an Olympus IX81 microscope . We used a 40 (cid:2) Olympus objec - tive ( NA 0 . 6 ) for all recordings . For simultaneous ratiometric FRET recordings , filters specific to donor and acceptor excitation and emission wavelengths were alternated using the fluorescence tur - ret . We controlled the microscope turret control with an in - house script written in PYTHON . Briefly , the turret was synchronized to the electrophysiology acquisition computer using voltage output from the digitizer via an Arduino microcontroller to a reverse - engineered serial connection ( using the PySerial library ; https : / / pythonhosted . org / pyserial / index . html ) from a second computer to the IX81 microscope . Fluorescence intensities in response to 445 and 514 nm excitation were recorded sequentially with 100 ms exposure time and 2 (cid:2) 2 binning on a Prime 95B CMOS camera ( Photomet - rics ) fitted to Cairn Optosplit - II . CFP and YFP emission were split with a T495lpxr dichroic mirror , and recorded on the same frame after passing through ET520 / 40 m ( YFP ) and ET470 / 24 m ( CFP ) fil - ters ( all mounted within the Optosplit , all Chroma ) . Exposures were timed to precede the – 80 mV voltage steps . Laser emission and camera exposure were triggered in hardware directly from the digitizer . Images were recorded with Micromanager ( Edelstein et al . , 2014 ) and analyzed with FIJI as described above . Reverse aggregation system A - CFP - FM 2 - or A - CFP - FM 2 / E - YFP - expressing cells were measured 24 hr post - transfection . Aggre - gates were released by adding 0 . 5 m M D / D solubilizer ( TaKaRa ) to the growth medium and incuba - tion for 10 , 80 or 165 min at 37˚C in 5 % CO 2 before seFRET measurements . All buffers used during the measurement contained 0 . 5 m M D / D solubilizer . Mean cFRET was acquired from manually - drawn ROIs over the whole cell for ER - and plasma membrane - localized VRAC . For plasma membrane , only cells with clear plasma membrane localization were selected by visual inspection . To determine the cFRET of Golgi - localized VRAC , masks were created on CFP images by applying a threshold over the high - intensity , juxta - nuclear regions and applying these masks on the respective cFRET maps . Statistical analysis Data are represented as mean of individual cells ± standard deviation ( s . d . ) or mean of n ( number of independent experiments ) ± standard error of the mean ( s . e . m . ) as indicated .
