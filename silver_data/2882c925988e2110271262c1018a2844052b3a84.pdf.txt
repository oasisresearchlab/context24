Mitchison Supporting Online Material Methods Protein purification Non - muscle myosin II was purified from expired human platelets according to the method of Daniel and Sellers ( 1 ) followed by gel filtration through potassium iodide and Mg•ATP as described by Pollard ( 2 ) to remove residual actin . Papain cleavage to generate subfragment 1 ( S1 ) was performed as described ( 3 ) . Chicken gizzard myosin II was purified by the method of Trybus ( 4 ) . Rabbit skeletal muscle myosin S1 was generously provided by Jody Dantzig , Alex Shaw and Yale Goldman . Myosin light chain kinase was purified from chicken gizzard as described ( 5 ) . Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described ( 6 ) . High throughput screening High throughput screening for inhibitors of non - muscle myosin II ATPase was performed as previously described ( 7 ) with the following modifications . Approximately 2 µl of an ATPase reaction mixture ( 200 mM KCl , 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 9 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 50 µM ATP , 10 µg / ml calmodulin , 15 µg / ml MLCK , 0 . 2 mg / ml human platelet myosin , 0 . 3675 mg / ml actin , 0 . 01 % TritonX - 100 ) was distributed into each well of a 1536 well plate . Chemical compounds ( 40 nl ) were transferred into wells of the plate using a steel pin array . The reaction was incubated for 1 . 75 hr at 37°C then 4 nl of development solution ( 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 8 , 5 mM MgSO 4 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM NaN 3 , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM D - luciferin , 2 . 5 µg / ml luciferase ) was distributed into each well 2 using a cartesian sprayer . Luminescence was then imaged using a telecentric lens coupled to a cooled CCD camera . All screening was performed in duplicate . Myosin ATPase assays The actin activated Mg•ATPase activity in Figure 1B was measured in a Beckman DU - 640 spectrophotometer using an NADH - linked assay ( 8 ) . The conditions were 2 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM MOPS , 0 . 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 20 µM actin , 200 µM NADH , 1 µM phophoenolpyruvate , 40 U / ml lactate dehydrogenase , 200 U / ml pyruvate kinase , 37° for smooth muscle HMM ( 9 ) , NMIIA HMM ( 10 ) , NMIIB HMM ( 11 ) and Myo1b ( Mike Ostap ) . Rabbit skeletal muscle HMM ( gift of Earl Homsher , UCLA ) was measured under the same conditions , but at 25° . MyoV S1 ( 12 ) and myo10 HMM ( Chen et al . in preparation ) were measured at 25° under the same ionic conditions , but 0 . 1 M KCl was present . The activities in the presence of 50 mM and 100 mM blebbistatin were normalized to the value for the same myosin measured in the absence of blebbistatin . Each value represents the mean and S . D . of three to five assays . Myosin ATPase assays in Figures 1A and S2A were performed as described ( 7 ) with the following modifications . Platelet S1 myosin was assayed at a final concentration of 52 µg / ml in assay buffer ( 200 mM KCl , 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 0 , 10 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM 2 - amino - 6 - mercapto - 7methyl - purine riboside ( MESG ) , 10U / ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( PNP ) ) . Myosin in assay buffer was added to a 10X stock of blebbistatin in DMSO followed by the addition of ATP to 0 . 1 mM . Absorbance readings at 360 nm were taken every 10 seconds . Full - length human platelet myosin and chicken gizzard myosin were assayed in the presence of 15 . 2 µg / ml MLCK and 10 µg / ml calmodulin . Rabbit skeletal myosin S1 was assayed at a concentration of 25 µg / ml . Motility assay In vitro motility was performed using full - length human platelet myosin as described ( 7 , 13 ) . Myosin was introduced into flow chambers at 0 . 23 mg / ml . The final motility reaction also contained 10 µg / ml MLCK , 5 . 6 µg / ml calmodulin and blebbistatin . 3 Blebbistatin synthesis Blebbistatin was synthesized by condensation of methyl 2 - amino - 5 - methylbenzoate with 1 - phenyl - 2 - pyrrolidinone followed by cyclization in the presence of lithium bis ( trimethylsilyl ) amide . The product was then oxidized with either ( 1S ) - ( + ) or ( 1R ) - ( - ) - ( camphorsulfonyl ) oxaziridine to give blebbistatin . Detailed synthesis information will be published elsewhere ( Straight and Westwood , manuscript in preparation ) . Based upon a related synthetic strategy ( 14 ) we believe the ( - ) - enantiomer to be the S - enantiomer but we have not yet confirmed the absolute stereochemistry . Enantiomers of blebbistatin were purified by isocratic elution in 9 : 1 hexanes : isopropanol using chiral solid phase HPLC ( Chiralcel - OD - H , Daicel , Japan ) . Blebbistatin concentrations were normalized using an extinction coefficient of 7400 at 422 nm . Myosin light chain kinase assay Myosin light chain kinase activity was assayed in MLCK buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 0 , 100 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM DTT ) . Each reaction contained 1 µg human platelet myosin , 0 . 125 µg calmodulin and 38 ng MLCK . Reactions were mixed with indicated concentrations of inhibitor then ATP was added to give a final concentration of 30 µM cold ATP and 1 . 5 µM g - 32P - ATP ( 10 Ci / mmol ) . Reactions were incubated for 10 minutes at 30°C , stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS - PAGE ( 15 % ) . Microscopy Microscopy using cultured M2 cells , goldfish keratocytes , and HeLa cells was performed on a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope . Cells were maintained at constant temperature in a custom designed stage incubator . Images were captured using an ORCA - ER CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Inc . ) using Metamorph software ( Universal Imaging Corp . ) . Fluorescence deconvolution microscopy was performed on a DeltaVision system ( Applied Precision ) . 4 Tissue culture M2 cells were cultured in MEM with Earle’s salts and 10 mM Hepes pH 7 . 55 supplemented with 8 % calf serum and 2 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , XTC cells were cultured in 70 % Leibovitz’s L - 15 supplemented with 10 % FBS , goldfish keratocytes were isolated and cultured as described ( 15 ) but without trypsinization of scales . HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS . Drug treatments To test the effect of ( + ) and ( - ) enantiomers of blebbistatin on HeLa cells , cells were synchronized for 7 hours in 100 µM monastrol then released into increasing concentrations of blebbistatin . Cells were fixed ( fix buffer = 80 mM PIPES pH 6 . 8 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , 4 % formaldehyde ) after 3 hours and binucleate cells were quantified by hoechst staining . For synchronized cell experiments , HeLa cells were synchronized by the addition of 2 . 5 mM thymidine . Two 16 hour thymidine arrests were separated by a 9 hour release period . Cells were released from the second thymidine arrest for 4 hours followed by the addition of monastrol to 100 µM and incubation for an additional 8 hours . Monastrol arrested cells were collected by shakeoff , washed out of monastrol into 100 µM ( ± ) - blebbistatin and plated onto poly - L - lysine coated coverslips . To assess progression of cells through mitosis in blebbistatin , cells were incubated for increasing time after mitotic block on coverslips with or without blebbistatin then fixed for 15 ′ at 37°C . Cells were stained for α - tubulin , myosin II , lamin , and DNA . For MG132 experiments , cells were incubated for 80 minutes in blebbistatin followed by media exchange into blebbistatin ± 100µM MG132 then fixation at increasing time after MG132 treatment . For other drug experiments , cells were incubated for 60 minutes on coverslips before exchanging the medium to medium containing blebbistatin and either , 33 µM nocodazole , 5 µM latrunculin - B , 1 µM staurosporine , or 50 µM Y - 27632 . Twenty minutes after media exchange , cells were fixed in 80 mM Pipes pH 6 . 8 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 % TritonX - 100 and 4 % formaldehyde for 15 minutes at 37°C . Cells were then stained for tubulin , non - muscle myosin II , anillin and DNA . The duration of C - phase in XTC cells was measured by time - lapse microscopy . Cells were allowed to initiate anaphase in the presence of 5 blebbistatin followed by drug washout at increasing times after anaphase onset . All cells treated with blebbistatin for < 45 ′ after anaphase onset were able to complete cytokinesis after washout but all cells treated for > 45 ′ failed to divide ( n = 9 ) . Some contraction could occur at times > 45 ′ but division was unsuccessful . References 1 . J . L . Daniel , J . R . Sellers , Methods Enzymol 215 , 78 ( 1992 ) . 2 . T . D .
