Talin and Vinculin Play Distinct Roles in Filopodial Motility in the Neuronal Growth Cone Anne M . Sydor , Anne L . Su , Feng - Song Wang , Alian Xu , and Daniel G . Jay Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology , and the Neuroscience Program , Harvard University , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02138 Abstract . Filopodial motility is critical for many bio - logical processes , particularly for axon guidance . This motility is based on altering the F - actin - based cytoskel - eton , but the mechanisms of how this occurs and the actin - associated proteins that function in this process remain unclear . We investigated two of these proteins found in filopodia , talin and vinculin , by inactivating them in subregions of chick dorsal root ganglia neu - ronal growth cones and by observing subsequent be - havior by video - enhanced microscopy and quantitative morphometry . Microscale chromophore - assisted laser inactivation of talin resulted in the temporary cessation of filopodial extension and retraction . Inactivation of vinculin caused an increased incidence of filopodial bending and buckling within the laser spot but had no effect on extension or retraction , These findings show that talin acts in filopodial motility and may couple both extension and retraction to actin dynamics . They also suggest that vinculin is not required for filopodial extension and retraction but plays a role in the struc - tural integrity of filopodia . major challenge in cell biology is understanding the molecular mechanisms of cell motility . This is par - ticularly true for understanding the formation of the nervous system as the neuronal growth cone responds to signals in its environment by directed filopodial motil - ity . The direction of growth cone motility can be altered by a single filopodial contact ( O ' Connor et al . , 1990 ) . More - over , fitopodial elimination by cytochalasin disorients growth cone pathfinding in vitro ( Marsh and Letourneau , 1984 ; Zheng et al . , 1996 ) and in vivo ( Bentley and Tor - oian - Raymond , 1986 ; Chien et al . , 1993 ) . Filopodia are densely filled with bundled F - actin ( Ya - mada et al . , 1970 ) , and it is thought that the interaction of actin - associated proteins is required for their motility . Some of these proteins can bundle F - actin , as required for the parallel actin filaments found in filopodia ( Stossel , 1993 ) . Others may function to attach F - actin to macromo - lecular complexes such as focal contacts during motility ( Burridge et al . , 1988 ) . Many actin - associated proteins have been identified in the growth cone , but it has thus far been difficult to demonstrate a functional role for any of these proteins inside neuronal growth cones ( Letourneau , 1992 ) . We are particularly interested in finding proteins that might serve to connect F - actin to the membrane and ultimately to the external environment . Talin and vinculin are good candidates to play such a role . Talin is a 270 - kD protein that binds to F - actin , the 131 Address all correspondence to Daniel Jay , Harvard Biological Labs , 16 Divinity Avenue , Cambridge , MA 02138 .

It colocalizes with these proteins in fibroblast focal adhesion plaques ( Samuelsson et al . , 1993 ) , and microinjection of polyclonal antibodies to talin de - creases fibroblast motility ( Nuckolls et at . , 1992 ) . It is found in chick dorsal root ganglia ( DRG ) 1 neuronal growth cones ( Letourneau and Shattuck , 1989 ) where it localizes to focal contacts ( Letourneau and Gomez , 1996 ) . Vinculin , a ll7 - kD protein , is also a major component of focal contacts ( Burridge et al . , 1988 ) and is found in neu - ronal growth cones ( Letourneau and Shattuck , 1989 ) . Vin - culin binds to talin ( Burridge and Mangeat , 1984 ) , F - actin ( Johnson and Craig , 1995 ) , and a - actinin ( Wachsstock et al . , 1987 ) in vitro . It colocalizes with these proteins and the 131 subunit of the integrin receptor in fibroblasts ( Samuelsson et al . , 1993 ) . Studies have implicated a role for vinculin in adhesion or motility in fibroblasts ( Westmeyer et al . , 1991 ; Rodriguez - Fernandez et al . , 1992 , 1993 ) and PC12 cells ( Varnum - Finney and Reichardt , 1994 ) . While much is known about the in vitro properties of talin and vinculin , what they do in cells remains unclear . This is particularly true for neurons for which functional perturbation studies have been difficult . Although previ - ous investigations have generated chronic functional per - turbations of these proteins in other cell types ( Nuckolls et al . , 1992 ; Varnum - Finney and Reichardt , 1994 ) , these 1 .

We have addressed the role of talin and vinculin in filopodia by generating the acute and localized loss of these proteins using microscale chromophore - assisted la - ser inactivation of protein function ( micro - CALl ) ( Dia - mond et al . , 1993 ) . Micro - CALl functionally inactivates proteins of interest within a 10 - txm spot by targeting a la - ser microbeam of a wavelength not absorbed by most cel - lular components ( 620 nm ) to the protein of interest via a nonblocking antibody labeled with the chromophore mal - achite green ( MG ) ( Jay , 1988 ) . Laser excitation of the chromophore generates short - lived free radicals that dam - age proteins within 15 A of the dye molecules ( Liao et al . , 1994 ) . CALI is selective for the bound protein even in multiprotein complexes ( Linden et al . , 1992 ; Liao et al . , 1995 ) and has precisely phenocopied genetic loss of func - tion mutations in all cases tested ( Beermann and Jay , 1994 ) . Micro - CALI was recently applied to focally inacti - vate calcineurin in DRG growth cones , resulting in a local retraction of filopodia ( Chang et al . , 1995 ) . Here we report our experiments that address the molecular mechanisms of filopodial motility , by focally inactivating talin and vin - culin using micro - CALl . Materials and Methods Antibodies mAb 8d4 , which recognizes talin ( Otey et al . , 1990 ) , mAb VIN 11 . 5 , which recognizes vinculin ( Westmeyer et al . , 1990 ) , and purified mouse IgG ( nonimmune ) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . VIN 11 . 5 was further purified by protein A chromatography . Antibodies were labeled with malachite green isothiocyanate ( Molecular Probes , Inc . , Eugene , OR ) to a ratio of six to eight dye moieties per protein molecule by the method of Jay ( 1988 ) . Fluorescent secondary antibodies were pur - chased from Cappel Laboratories ( Malvern , PA ) . Neuronal Culture DRG neurons from E9 - 12 chick embryos ( Spafas , Inc . , Noi ~ , ich , CT ) were dissociated and cultured as modified from Bray ( 1991 ) . DRGs were placed in 0 . 25 % trypsin ( in Hanks ' balanced buffered saline HBBS with - out Ca 2 + and Mg2 + ; GIBCO BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) at 37°C for 15 min and dissociated using a p200 Pipetteman ( Rainin Instrument Co . , Inc . , Woburn , MA ) . Cells were washed in supplemented L15 media ( standard DRG neuronal media with 25 ng / ml NGF 7S ; Boehringer Mannheim Bio - chemicals , Indianapolis , IN and 10 % FBS Sigma Chemical Co . ) , plated onto poly - L - lysine - ( 1 mg / ml ) and laminin - ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ) coated coverslips , and incubated at 37°C in supplemented L15 media . Immunoblotting Immunoblot analyses were performed according to Dubreuil et al . ( 1987 ) . In brief , Ell chick DRGs were lysed in 50 ixl of a buffer containing 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals ) and vortexed , and 2× gel sample buffer was added . Sam - ples of DRGs ( 2 . 5 DRGs per lane ) were then electrophoresed on 7 % SDS - PAGE minigels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose . The nitrocellulose blots were blocked with 10 % nonfat dry milk , incu - bated for 3 h at room temperature with 1 p . g / ml VIN . 11 anti - vinculin or 8d4 anti - talin mAbs , and probed with alkaline phosphatase - labeled goat anti - mouse IgG antibodies ( 1 : 500 ) for 1 h at room temperature . Blots were then developed in alkaline phosphatase substrate ( Sigma Chemical Co , ) . Immunocytochemistry Cultured E12 chick DRG neurons on glass coverslips were fixed for 10 min with 4 % formaldehyde ( freshly made from paraformaldehyde ) and 400 mM sucrose in PBS as modified from Letourneau and Shattuck ( 1989 ) . After fixation , cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0 . 5 % Tri - ton X - 100 in PBS . After three gentle washes in PBS , cells were incubated for 30 min in blocking buffer ( PBS with 10 % goat serum ) , followed by pri - mary antibody diluted in blocking buffer at 4°C overnight . After three rinses in PBS , cells were probed with FITC - conjugated secondary anti - bodies ( 1 : 50 ) and rhodamine - phalloidin ( 0 . 66 IxM final ; Molecular Probes , Inc . ) diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature . After three rinses in PBS , cells were mounted in Fluoromount - G ( Southern Biotech - nology Associates , Inc . , Birmingham , AL ) and viewed using a confocal microscope ( LSM 410 ; Carl Zeiss , Inc . , Thornwood , NY ) . Antibody Loading by Trituration Malachite green - labeled antibodies were loaded into DRG neurons by a modified trituration method ( Borasio et al . , 1989 ; Clarke and McNeil , 1992 ) . After incubation in 0 . 25 % trypsin ( in HBBS without Ca 2 - and Mg 2÷ ) at 37°C for 15 min , as described above , DRGs were placed in 50 p , l of the desired antibody solution at concentrations between 1 and 1 . 8 mg / ml in HBBS . DRGs were drawn up and down in yellow Pipetteman tips using a p200 micropipetteman until there was a uniform suspension of sin - gle cells ( ~ 100 strokes ) . This is thought to create temporary holes in the cell membranes ( Clarke and McNeil , 1992 ) , enabling antibodies to enter the cells . To visualize loading , FITC - conjugated rabbit IgG ( I mg / ml ) was included in the antibody solution during trituration . After trituration , cells were centrifuged twice for 10 s at 2 , 000 rpm ( IEC clinical centrifuge ; Inter - national Equipment Co . , Needham Heights , MA ) to remove the antibody solution , gently suspended in supplemented L15 media , and plated , as de - scribed previously . These loaded DRG neurons were then used for micro - CALl . To compare loading and cytoskeletal retention , loaded neurons were either fixed and extracted as decribed above or they were extracted for 3 rain with 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 , 60 mM Pipes , 25 mM Hepes , 10 mM EGTA , and 2 mM MgC12 at 37°C ( Letourneau , 1983 ) before fixation . Cells were then probed with 1 : 50 FITC - conjugated goat anti - mouse lgG ( H + L ) and 0 . 66 p , M rhodamine - phalloidin at room temperature for 2 h , rinsed , mounted , and viewed as described above . Micro - CALl of Proteins in Growth Cones Micro - CALl was performed as described previously ( Diamond et al . , 1993 ; Chang et al . , 1995 ) . DRG neuronal cultures were kept at 37°C with a stage incubator ( Opti - Quip Inc . , Highland Mills , NY ) throughout the ex - periment . Micro - CALl was performed from 1 to 6 h after plating to en - sure that the neurons were still loaded with antibodies . In a typical micro - CALI experiment , neurons were briefly observed by epifluorescence to verify antibody loading . A chosen growth cone was first observed using phase - contrast optics for 5 rain , and then a region of the growth cone was laser irradiated for 5 min ( h = 620 nm , " r = 3 . 5 ns , 30 ~ J per pulse at 20 Hz ) using a nitrogen - driven dye laser ( model VSL - 337 ; Laser Science Inc . , Newton , MA ) . Growth cones were observed during irradiation , and for an additional 5 min , by time - lapse video microscopy ( every 15 s ) using cus - tom - written software ( Jay and Keshishian , 1990 ) and an optical memory disc recorder ( Panasonic , Secaucus . N J ) . Methods of Quantitation Growth cone parameters measured were bending / buckling of filopodia , filopodial number , and the rates of filopodial motility and neurite out - growth . Quantitation was done using NIH Scion Imaging System software ( Scion Co . , Frederick , MD ) and analyzed using Cricket Graph software ( Malvern , PA ) and Minitab Statistics software ( Pennsylvania State Uni - versity ) ( significance level of P < 0 . 05 ) . Filopodial length was measured in every frame of the time - lapse period . The rates of extension and retrac - tion were obtained by taking the first derivatives of these plots . A growth cone was scored as having a cessation in motility only if the rates of irradi - ated filopodia for that growth cone dropped to 0 . 0 - 0 . 2 ixm / min for > 1 min in the irradiated area . No bias in selecting filopodia for irradiation oc - curred ; the rates of the filopodial motility inside and outside the laser spot were compared before irradiation to ensure that they were statistically in - distinguishable . Filopodial bending was defined as a single angular event ( > 15° ) , and buckling was defined as two or more angular events in a filopodium often accompanied by loss of attachment to the substratum . Most of the data were analyzed double blind to ensure objective scoring of pa - rameters ; data sets done without double - blind analysis showed similar results . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 134 , 1996 1198 Results Talin and Vinculin Antibodies Are Loaded into Chick DRG Neuronal Growth Cones We confirmed that our antibodies recognized talin and vinculin by immunoblotting ( Fig . 1 ) and by indirect immu - nocytochemistry ( Figs . 2 and 3 ) . Immunoblotting with VIN . 11 of DRG cell lysates showed a predominant band with an apparent molecular mass of 117 kD , which corre - sponds to the molecular mass of vinculin ( Fig . 1 , lane a ) . Immunoblotting with 8d4 recognized a 230 - kD species that corresponds to the molecular mass of talin , but sev - eral other bands were detected including a major 80 - kD band ( Fig . 1 , lane b ) . These other bands are very likely to be proteolytic fragments of talin . Immunoblotting using a different anti - talin antibody recognizes the same bands ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , talin is very susceptible to proteolysis ( Molony et al . , 1987 ) , and immunoblotting of a preparation of purified talin that had been stored at 4°C showed bands of similar size . lmmunocytochemistry using 8d4 and VIN . 11 showed patterns of talin and vinculin expression within DRG growth cones after extraction similar to those seen by Le - tourneau and Shattuck ( 1989 ) . Double labeling with rho - damine - phalloidin to reveal microfilaments shows signifi - cant colocalization with 8d4 anti - talin ( Fig . 2 , a - d ) and , to a lesser extent , with anti - vinculin ( Fig . 2 , e - h ) . The pattern of talin localization is punctate , suggesting that talin re - sides in focal contacts and clearly extends to filopodia . Vinculin expression was concentrated in the main body of the growth cone but also extended into the filopodia . To inactivate these proteins using CALI , it was neces - sary to load dye - labeled antibodies into the neuronal growth cones . Chick DRG neurons were loaded with anti - bodies by trituration . Typically , 50 % of the neurons sur - vive , and of these , > 80 % had antibodies that were re - tained with a half - life of 12 h ( Sydor , A . M . , unpublished results ) . Figure 1 . Specificity of antibodies by immunoblotting . Immuno - blot analysis confirms that VIN . 11 recognizes a single predomi - nant species in DRG neuronal lysates with the apparent molecu - lar mass of vinculin ( arrow , lane a ) . 8d4 recognizes a band at 230 kD corresponding to the molecular mass of talin ( arrow , lane b ) but also recognizes several other bands ( * ) that are likely to be proteolytic fragments , as talin is very susceptible to cleavage in cell lysates . We verified that the antibodies were loaded and re - tained in growth cones by immunocytochemistry of fixed and detergent - extracted neurons using secondary anti - body alone ( Fig . 3 ) . Anti - talin , anti - vinculin , and nonim - mune mouse IgG immunoreactivity were detected in the growth cone of trituration - loaded DRG neurons . All three antibodies were found in the growth cone of neurons that were fixed and then extracted , and the staining extended out to the filopodia . Both talin and vinculin staining were retained in neurons that had been extracted before fixa - tion and had significant overlap with rhodamine - phalloi - din staining , showing an association of anti - talin and anti - vinculin antibodies with the F - actin cytoskeleton . These patterns were similar to those observed by indirect immu - nocytochemistry ( Fig . 2 ; Letourneau and Shattuck , 1989 ) . In contrast , neurons loaded with nonimmune IgG showed uniform staining , showing that IgG was present in the growth cone and filopodia , but upon extraction , this stain - ing was lost , showing that this nonspecific antibody did not associate with the cytoskeleton . Control cells stained with secondary antibody alone did not display detectable stain - ing ( data not shown ) . Together , these findings show that trituration introduces these antibodies into DRG neuronal growth cones , and the antibodies specifically recognize their respective antigens . Antibody Loading Has No Effect on Growth Cone Motility Loading of MG - 8d4 , MG - VINll . 5 , or MG - nonimmune IgG into DRG neurons did not affect the rate of neurite outgrowth ( Fig . 4 a ) , filopodial number ( Fig . 4 b ) , or filopodial motility ( Table I ) . Growth cone morphology was not affected by trituration loading of these antibodies . Neurons extended long , healthy neurites , and neurite number and length were similar for all conditions ob - served for up to 2 d ( data not shown ) . We also loaded MG - BSA into DRG neurons or carried out trituration without added protein ( mock loaded ) , and no significant effect was observed for the measured parameters ( Fig . 4 ) . Micro - CALl of Talin But Not Vinculin Stalls Filopodial Motility We locally inactivated talin by laser irradiating regions of growth cones ( Fig . 5 a , circle ; t = 0 : 00 ) loaded with mala - chite green - labeled antibodies to talin ( MG - anti - talin ) . This caused filopodia in the irradiated region to stall , ceas - ing extension , retraction , and lateral movement for 2 - 5 min ( Fig . 5 a ; compare arrow in t = 2 : 00 with t = 7 : 15 ) . Af - ter that time , motility was recovered ( t = 7 : 45 ) . Filopodia outside the area of irradiation showed no change in motil - ity . The cessation of filopodial motility occurred in 80 % ( n = 31 ) of neurons treated with micro - CALl of talin , and this behavior was rarely seen with neurons grown on uni - form permissive substrates . Lamellipodia within the laser spot occasionally showed a slight retraction when laser light was initiated , but recovered within a few seconds and showed normal dynamic motility thereafter . The loss of filopodial dynamics is clearly illustrated by plotting the rates of change in filopodial length vs time ( Fig . 6 , a and b ; graphs ) . Before laser irradiation , these rates varied substantially for all filopodia . 2 rain after laser Sydor et al . Talin and Vinculin Function in Growth Cone Filopodia 1199 Figure 2 .

Filopodia that were not laser irradiated showed no apparent change in the rates of extension and retraction throughout the time - lapse period ( Fig . 6 b ) . In contrast , micro - CALl of vinculin had no effect on filopodial extension and retraction within the laser spot ( Fig . 5 b , circle ; t = 0 : 00 ) or outside the spot ( Figs . 5 b and 6 , c and d ) . As vinculin binds to talin in focal contacts , these results act as a negative control , supporting the spec - ificity of the inactivation of talin . We also tested for non - specific effects of laser irradiation on control cells loaded with a malachite green - labeled nonimmune antibody The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 134 , 1996 1200 Figure 3 . Trituration loading , of antibodies into chick DRG neu - rons and their retention . Immuno - cytochemistry of antibody - loaded chick DRG neurons using FITC secondary antibodies confirms trituration loading of antibodies into DRG neuronal growth cones , and that these antibodies are re - tained by the cytoskeleton . Chick DRG neurons that were tritura - tion loaded with 8d4 ( a - Talin ) , VINll . 5 ( a - Vinculin ) , or nonim - mune IgG ( IgG ) were fixed before detergent extraction ( Loaded ) , or detergent - extracted before fixa - tion ( Extracted ) to show cytoskel - etal retention of antibodies , and subsequently probed with FITC - labeled secondary antibodies and rhodamine - phalloidin . Note that all trituration - loaded antibodies reach growth cone filopodia , but only anti - talin and anti - vinculin antibodies are retained after ex - traction . Moreover , double label - ing with these antibodies and rhodamine - phalloidin ( Rd - Ph ) show overlap , suggesting that these anti - talin and anti - vinculin colocalize with the cytoskeleton ( Double ) .

All filopodia remained dynamic throughout the 15 - min time - lapse recording ( Figs . 5 c and 6 , e and f ) . Laser excitation of MG - IgG had no effect on filopodial movement , growth cone behavior , or neurite outgrowth . Localized inactivation of talin caused a regional loss of filopodial extension and retraction that was significantly different ( P < 0 . 001 ) than all other treatments ( Table I ) . There was a significant drop in the rate of filopodial exten - Sydor et al . Talin and Vinculin Function in Growth Cone Filopodia 1201 such as neurite outgrowth or filopodial number ( Fig . 4 , a and b ) . Micro - CALl of Vinculin Causes Filopodial Bending and Buckling Filopodia treated with micro - CALI of vinculin had a greater tendency to bend or buckle ( Fig . 5 b , arrow ; t = 7 : 15 ) . Summation analysis of all growth cones tested showed that micro - CALI of vinculin resulted in an in - creased rate of bending and buckling of filopodia ( Fig . 7 ) . The percentages of bending or buckling filopodia of growth cones , correlated with respect to the time of initia - tion of laser irradiation , were summed and plotted against time . Growth cones normally have a small number of bent or buckled filopodia , and the baseline percentage of bent or buckled filopodia is 10 _ + 1 % as observed in the graph of unirradiated filopodia ( Fig . 7 , b , d , and f ) . Filopodia subjected to micro - CALl of vinculin within the laser spot showed a more than threefold increase in the percentage of bending or buckling during the lasing period ( Fig . 7 a ) . The time of half - maximal response is ~ 2 . 5 min and peaks at 5 min ( the end of laser irradiation ) . This incidence decreases after lasing and has returned al - most to baseline by 10 min after laser initiation . Unirradi - ated filopodia were unaffected ( Fig . 7 b ) , and laser irradia - tion of neurons loaded with MG - anti - talin or MG - IgG did not affect filopodial bending and buckling ( Fig . 7 , c - f ) . These data show that micro - CALI of vinculin caused in - creased filopodial bending and buckling , a different effect from that observed after micro - CALl of talin . Figure 4 . Antibody loading and micro - CALl of talin and vinculin does not affect neurite outgrowth or filopodial number . Neither loading of dye - labeled proteins ( MG - BSA , n = 12 ; MG - IgG , n = 22 ; MG - anti - talin , n = 31 ; MG - anti - vinculin , n = 18 ) nor the harsh trituration used for loading ( mock loaded ; n = 10 ) caused significant differences in rate of neurite outgrowth in Ixm per 5 rain ( a ) or number of filopodia per growth cone ( b ) , compared to unloaded controls that were dissociated more gently ( untreated ; n = 12 ) . Moreover , laser irradiation of the growth cones of these treated neurons also had no significant effect on these parameters ( zM test used to measure significance ) .

The aver - age filopodial motility did not drop to zero because 20 % of the growth cones was not affected and also because the duration of stalling and the time of recovery of motility varied between growth cones . CALI of talin and vinculin had no significant effect on other growth cone parameters Discussion Most of what is known about talin and vinculin has been gained from in vitro approaches ( Burridge et al . , 1988 ) or by chronic loss of function ( e . g . , Nuckolls et al . , 1992 ; Var - num - Finney and Reichardt , 1995 ) . Hypotheses regarding the dynamic roles of these proteins must be tested inside living cells . We have used micro - CALI to locally and acutely inactivate talin and vinculin to address their func - tions in chick DRG neuronal growth cone motility . Micro - CALI of talin caused filopodial stalling ; micro - CALI of vinculin resulted in increased filopodial bending or buck - ling . These findings suggest that talin and not vinculin serves to connect F - actin to the membrane and ultimately to the external environment . Nuckolls et al . ( 1992 ) showed that microinjection of polyclonal antibodies against talin into fibroblasts de - creased the rate of wound healing . Our findings extend this work to implicate talin in a specific role in cell motil - ity , namely filopodial extension and retraction . Moreover , our findings coupled with the observation that talin can si - multaneously bind F - actin and 13l subunit of integrin in vitro ( Burridge and Mangeat , 1984 ) , and the localization of talin at focal contacts in growth cone filopodia ( Figs . 2 and 3 ; Letourneau and Gomez , 1996 ; Letourneau and Shattuck , 1989 ) suggests that talin couples F - actin to the substratum during filopodial motility . Our findings do not address the movement of unattached filopodia . The vast majority of filopodia that could be observed throughout the time course were attached to the substratum .

The number of filopodia that bent or buckled at each 15 - s time point in the 15 - rain time - lapse period was pooled for all irradiated and unirradiated filopodia on growth cones that received the same micro - CALI treatment to obtain the percentage of bending and buckling at each time point . A baseline 10 % of filopodia was bent or buckled before laser irradiation ( left of first arrowhead ) . * , a significant difference from the baseline average ( zM test , P < 0 . 05 ) . ( a and b ) Micro - CALl of vinculin caused a significant increase to 35 - 40 % bending and buckling of irradiated filopodia ( a ) that gradually decreased toward baseline after laser irradiation ( right of second arrowhead ) . Unirradiated filopodia ( b ) showed no significant increase in bending and buckling above baseline levels . ( c - f ) Micro - CALl of talin ( c and d ) or MG - IgG controls ( e and f ) showed no significant change in bending and buckling regardless of laser irradiation . Sydor et al . Talin and Vinculin Function in Growth Cone Filopodia 1205 experiments were done and analyzed ( focal plane at the surface of the coverslip ) , it was only possible to track at - tached filopodia , as these were the only ones in focus throughout the time lapse . Filopodia extend and retract dynamically , and net growth must depend on the relative ratio of the two . That both ex - tension and retraction cease after talin inactivation sug - gests that movement in both directions is dependent on tatin . It is known that filopodia are held in tension ( Bray , 1979 ) , and the counteracting rearward and forward forces may act simultaneously at focal contacts . In this way , talin may play a crucial role as the fulcrum in the balance of forces during filopodial movement . This role makes the regulation of talin - integrin binding by tyrosine phosphor - ylation ( Tapley et al . , 1989 ; Schmidt et al . , 1993 ) particu - larly interesting as a means of regulating filopodial motil - ity . Localized interactions with extracellular cues could regulate tyrosine phosphorylation at this site ( Atashi et al . , 1992 ; Rivas et al . , 1992 ) , and thereby locally modulate the efficacy of the coupling of motility to actin dynamics . Several models for filopodial motility have been put forth ( Oster and Perelson , 1987 ; Mitchison and Kirschner , 1988 ; Sheetz et al . , 1992 ) . All of these require that the F - actin is fixed in position to either couple motility to actin dynam - ics or molecular motors ( Mitchison and Kirschner , 1988 ; Sheetz et al . , 1992 ) , or as a barrier to allow the generation of osmotic pressure ( Oster and Perelson , 1987 ) . Our data are consistent with talin acting to hold the F - actin in place with respect to the filopodium and the external environ - ment but do not distinguish between these models . The CALI - induced cessation of filopodial motility did not result in either a change in neurite outgrowth or growth cone turning when micro - CALl was done asym - metrically . This is in contrast with the effects previously observed when calcineurin was regionally inactivated ( Chang et al . , 1995 ) . Filopodial motility is known to be important for neurite extension and growth cone turning ( O ' Connor et al . , 1990 ; Marsh and Letourneau , 1984 ; Bentley and Toroian - Raymond , 1986 ; Forscher and Smith , I988 ) . The transient stalling of filopodia resulting from micro - CALl of talin is not sufficient to influence subsequent growth cone motility or neurite extension . Our findings suggest that vinculin has a role in the struc - tural integrity of the filopodia . Bending and buckling is commonly observed at low frequency , but we demon - strated the increased incidence of this behavior by sum - ming the filopodia from a population of growth cones cor - related with respect to the initiation time and site of laser irradiation . This type of analysis may be generally useful in observing trends in growth cone behavior in response to precisely timed stimuli . Previous studies that generated loss of vinculin have ob - served a change in motility in PC12 cells ( Varnum - Finney and Reichardt , 1995 ) and in fibroblasts ( Samuels et al . , 1993 ; Rodriguez - Fernandez et al . , 1993 ) , but the loss of vinculin mediated by antisense RNA in these two cell types caused opposite effects on motility . This suggests that the role of vinculin in motility is complex . Micro - CALl of vinculin in the filopodia resulted in bending and buckling , and this is consistent with the observation of un - stable filopodia in the PC12 cell experiments ( Varnum - Finney and Reichardt , 1995 ) , but we did not observe a change in filopodial or neurite extension . Our data showed that a short - term loss of vinculin in growth cone filopodia does not affect motility . These other studies generate a long - term change in vinculin function that may cumula - tively alter motility . Adhesion of filopodia has been suggested to explain filopodial buckling during outgrowth of mouse cerebral cortex neurons ( Sheetz et al . , 1992 ) , and vinculin may func - tion in adhesion as a component of focal contacts . Alterna - tively , vinculin binding to F - actin may bundle microfila - ments to stabilize filopodial structure . The mutiple F - actin binding sites on vinculin and its ability to bundle F - actin in vitro support this hypothesis ( Johnson and Craig , 1995 ) . As filopodia are held under tension ( Bray , 1979 ) , CALI may cause a weakening of vinculin - mediated focal con - tacts or a decrease of actin bundling within a filopodium that would result in a tension - mediated bending or buck - ling at its weakest point . The distinct growth cone motile behaviors in response to micro - CALI of talin and vinculin are a demonstration of the specificity of CALI for associated proteins inside growth cones . It is consistent with the spatial specificity of CALI shown in previous work in vitro ( Linden et al . , 1992 ; Liao et al . , 1994 ) and in vivo ( Liao et al . , 1995 ) . Other mi - cro - CALI experiments directed to growth cone proteins such as calcineurin ( Chang et al . , 1995 ) show markedly dif - ferent growth cone behaviors in response to localized inac - tivation of these proteins . These differential effects when CALI is directed to different proteins support the specific - ity of CALI and demonstrate its use in addressing protein function during growth cone motility and guidance . We believe that the approach and analysis presented here will also be useful in elucidating other cellular mechanisms .
