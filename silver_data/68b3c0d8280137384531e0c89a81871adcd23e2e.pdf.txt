Under physiological conditions it is likely that the slit dia - phragmunderliespermanentrenewalprocessestoindemnifyits stability in response to changes in filtration pressure . This would require constant reorganization of the podocyte foot process and the renewal of slit diaphragm components . Thus far , the mechanisms underlying the turnover of slit diaphragm proteins are largely unknown . In this manuscript we examined a mechanism of nephrin endocytosis via CIN85 / Ruk L - mediated ubiquitination . We can demonstrate that the loss of nephrin expression and onset of the proteinuria in CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice cor - relates with an increased accumulation of ubiquitinated pro - teins and expression of CIN85 / Ruk L in podocytes . In cultured murine podocytes CD2AP deficiency leads to an early ubiquiti - nation of nephrin and podocin after stimulation with fibroblast growth factor - 4 . Binding assays with different CIN85 / Ruk iso - forms and mutants showed that nephrin and podocin are bind - ing to the coiled - coil domain of CIN85 / Ruk L . We found that in the presence of CIN85 / Ruk L , which is involved in down - regula - tion of receptor - tyrosine kinases , nephrin is internalized after stimulation with fibroblast growth factor - 4 . Interestingly , coex - pression of CIN85 / Ruk L with CD2AP led to a decreased binding of CIN85 / Ruk L to nephrin and podocin , which indicates a func - tional competition between CD2AP and CIN85 / Ruk L . Our results support a novel role for CIN85 / Ruk L in slit diaphragm turnover and proteinuria . Podocytes are highly specialized epithelial cells that cover the outer surface of the glomerular capillary tuft . They distend pri - mary processes that further subdivide in numerous interdigi - tating foot processes . These foot processes form a specialized intercellular junction called “slit diaphragm . ” Many studies have emphasized the critical role of the slit diaphragm for maintaining the selective filtration barrier of the glomerulus ( 1 , 2 ) . Several proteins of the slit diaphragm have been identified that participate in common signaling pathways ( 3 – 5 ) . One of the major components is nephrin . Nephrin is a transmembrane adhesion protein of the Ig superfamily , encoded by NPHS1 . Humans and mice lacking nephrin are born without intact slit diaphragms and develop massive proteinuria already in utero ( 6 , 7 ) . There is cumulating evidence that nephrin is a signaling receptor molecule ; nephrin forms with podocin and Neph1 a protein complex within the lipid raft that structurally functions as a transmembrane receptor ( 8 ) . The intracellular human nephrin C terminus has several putative tyrosine phosphoryla - tion sites that can be phosphorylated by the Src kinase Fyn . This receptor complex has been shown to interact with several pro - tein kinases including Fyn , Yes , and phosphatidylinositol 3 - ki - nase as well as with several adaptor proteins like Nck , Grb2 , 2 and Crk ( 9 , 10 ) . A scaffolding protein that interacts with the nephrin - receptor complex is the cytoplasmic adaptor protein CD2AP , which is considered to play an important role in the maintenance of the slit diaphragm . Mice deficient for CD2AP are born healthy but develop a rapid onset nephrotic syndrome at 3 weeks of age and die of renal failure at 6 weeks after birth ( 11 ) . Up to now it is completely unclear why the CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice are born healthy with intact slit diaphragms and develop a significant proteinuria within a few days . Moreover , we previ - ously described the unusual phenotype in these mice that the damage occurs synchronized and concerns all podocytes at the same time ( 12 ) . A different member of the same adaptor protein family known as CIN85 / Ruk L displays high sequence ( 54 % ) and structural similarities to CD2AP ( 13 ) . Similar to CD2AP , CIN85 / Ruk L contains three SH3 domains and a coiled - coil domain but is missing the actin binding sites of CD2AP . Due to alternative splicing and different promoters , multiple CIN85 / Ruk isoforms were identified in cell lines of various tissue ori - gins ( 14 ) . We could previously show that the balance of CD2AP and CIN85 / Ruk L determines receptor - tyrosine kinase signaling response in podocytes and that this leads to a proapoptotic shift in the intracellular signaling signatures in response to growth factor stimulations ( 12 ) . These data give an explanation why CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes are more susceptible to cell stress and * This work was supported by an Emmy - Noether fellowship from the Deut - sche Forschungsgemeinschaft ( SCHI 587 / 2 - 2 ) and SFB 566 , Project B16 ( to M .

In this manuscript we hypoth - esized that the up - regulation of CIN85 / Ruk L that we detected previously in vitro in differentiating CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes as well as in vivo in CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) glomeruli ( 12 ) contributes to destabilization of the slit diaphragm complex . CIN85 / Ruk L function was previously linked to endophilin - dependent and ubiquitin - mediated internalization of the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor ( 16 ) . Ubiquitination is an emerging mechanism implicated in a variety of cellular functions like intracellular trafficking , gene transcription , DNA repair , and replication ( 17 , 18 ) . A selective reduction of extracellular neph - rin in IgA nephropathy and also for podocin in other renal damages was observed ( 19 , 20 ) . Recently , it was shown that expression of ubiquitin and ubiquitin C - terminal hydrolase L1 correlates with an internalization and down - regulation of nephrin ( 21 ) . In this study we demonstrate that CIN85 / Ruk L is a novel binding partner of nephrin and podocin and regulates the internalization of the slit diaphragm complex . Our findings support a molecular competition between CIN85 / Ruk L and CD2AP for binding to nephrin and podocin and lead us to hypothesize that a dynamic interplay between nephrin and podocin with these two adaptor molecules orchestrates the sta - bility and turnover of the slit diaphragm . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Antibodies and Cytokines —Primary antibodies that were used for Western blotting , immunohistochemical , and immu - nofluorescence studies were rabbit anti - nephrin ( targeting for the extracellular domain ) , rabbit anti - podocin , rabbit anti - FLAG ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , guinea pig anti - nephrin ( Progen , Heidelberg , Germany ) , mouse anti - ubiq - uitin ( for Western blot ) ( Imgenex , San Diego , CA ) , rabbit anti - ubiquitin ( Chemicon , Billerica , MA ) , rabbit anti - GFP , rabbit anti - myc ( Cell Signaling Technology , Beverly , MA ) , rabbit anti - CIN85 ( targeting for the C terminus ) ( kindly provided by I . Dikic , Frankfurt , Germany ) , rabbit IgG ( Jackson ImmunoRe - search Laboratories ) , and mouse IgG ( Santa Cruz , CA ) . FGF - 4 was purchased from Cell Sciences ( Canton , MA ) . Podocyte Culture —Cultivation of conditionally immortal - ized mouse CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) and CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes was per - formed as previously described ( 12 ) . In brief , to enhance expression of the thermosensitive large T antigen , cells were cultured at 33 °C in the presence of 10 units / ml (cid:2) - interferon ( permissive conditions ) . To induce differentiation , podocytes were maintained at 37 °C for 14 days without (cid:2) - interferon , resulting in the absence of thermosensitive T antigen ( nonper - missive conditions ) . The medium consists of RPMI 1640 ( Bio - chrom , Berlin , Germany ) containing 10 % FCS ( PAA , Pasching , Austria ) , 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) , and 10 units / ml recombinant mouse (cid:2) - interferon ( Cell Sciences , Can - ton , MA ) . Every experimental setup and result was confirmed in three different clones of CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) and CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes . Western Blot Analysis —To analyze whole cell protein lysates from cultured podocytes , either untreated or treated cells were lysed on ice in RIPA buffer ( 50 m M Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 150 m M NaCl , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 0 . 1 % SDS ) con - taining protease inhibitors ( Complete mini , Roche Applied Sci - ence ) , 1 m M sodium orthovanadate , 50 m M NaF , and 200 (cid:3) g / li - ter okadaic acid . Lysates were centrifuged at 12000 rpm , and aliquots of the supernatants were separated by 10 % SDS - PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes ( Immobilon - P , Millipore , Bedford , MA ) . After probing with primary antibodies , antigen - antibody complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase - labeled anti - rabbit and anti - mouse antibodies , respectively , and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents ( Pierce ) according to the manu - facturer’s protocol . Transfection —The day before transfection the podocytes were seeded on coverslides ( 5000 cells / slide ) and cultured under permissive conditions . Cells were transfected using FuGENE transfection reagent ( Roche Applied Science ) accord - ing to the manufacturer’s protocol using CIN85 - GFP , Nephrin - SV5 , CD2AP - GFP , pdsRed - Monomer - Golgi ( Clontech ) , and empty vector GFPN1 . After transfection cells were cultured under nonpermissive conditions in normal growth medium for 48 h . For transfection of HEK 293T cells , cells were seeded on plates the day before transfection . After transfection with FLAG - tagged CIN85 / Ruk isoforms and mutants ( kindly pro - vided by Prof . V . Buchman and described in Ref . 14 ) , CD2AP - myc , Nephrin - GFP , podocin - GFP , and p85 - myc the cells were cultured in normal growth medium for 48 h . Transfection with Small Interfering RNAs —Podocytes were subcultured in a 24 - well plate ( for enzyme - linked immunosor - bent assay ) or in 10 - cm dishes ( for immunoprecipitation ) and allowed to differentiate for 4 days . One day before transfec - tion , the medium was replaced with growth medium ( RPMI medium with 10 % FCS ) without antibiotics so that they would be 30 – 50 % confluent at the time of transfection . Transfection with CIN85 / Ruk L or control siRNA ( Santa Cruz ) was performed with Lipofectamine TM 2000 ( Invitro - gen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . After 6 h in the incubator the medium was replaced with normal growth medium . The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a CO 2 incuba - tor for 72 h . Immunoprecipitation —HEK 293T cells were transfected as mentioned above . Then the cells were washed carefully with ice - cold PBS on ice . For lysis , 900 (cid:3) l of RIPA buffer ( 50 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 200 m M NaCl , 1 m M EDTA , 1 m M EGTA , 1 % Triton , and 0 . 25 % deoxycholate (cid:2) protease inhibitors ) were added to cells . The lysate was incubated for 15 min on ice and centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C . 50 (cid:3) l of FLAG beads ( 50 % slurry in Triton buffer ) ( Sigma ) were added to the supernatant and rotated overhead at 4 °C for 1 h ( up to over - night ) . After that the beads were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C and washed with RIPA buffer 5 times . Proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . Western blots were performed using the methods mentioned above . For the ubiq - uitination assay of nephrin and podocin , 500 (cid:3) g of total cell lysate was incubated with 2 (cid:3) g of anti - nephrin or anti - podo - cin antibody / 1 ml immunoprecipitation volume and Sepha - rose - A beads ( 40 (cid:3) l ) in immunoprecipitation - buffer ( 25 m M CIN85 / Ruk L Mediates Slit Diaphragm Turnover in Podocytes 25286 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 285•NUMBER 33• AUGUST 13 , 2010 by gu e s t on J un e 20 , 2014 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Tris - HCL , pH 7 . 5 , 1 m M dithiothreitol , 30 m M MgCl 2 , 40 m M NaCl , 0 , 5 % Nonidet P - 40 and protease inhibitors ) and rotated overnight at 4 °C . The pellets were washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer and separated by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . Immunofluorescence - based Endocytosis Assay —For internal - ization studies , podocytes were plated on glass slides . Cells were then transfected as mentioned above . The day before stimula - tion the cells were serum - starved overnight . The next day cells were simultaneously incubated with an ectodomain anti - neph - rin antibody , Cy3 - conjugated secondary antibody , and stimu - lated for 1 h with 20 ng / ml FGF - 4 in RPMI without FCS . After that the cells were washed 5 times with PBS and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde . The pictures were taken with an Inverted - 2 Confocal Microscope and Leica Application Suite Software ( Leica , Bonn , Germany ) . Post - processing was done with Photo Shop 6 . 0 . Endocytosis Assay ( Enzyme - linked Immunosorbent As - say - based ) —HEK 293T cells were transfected with constructs SV5 - Nephrin ( a gift from T . Huber , Freiburg , Germany ) , GFPN1 , CD2AP - GFP , podocin - GFP , CIN85 - GFP , and FLAG - tagged Ruk mutants as described above . 24 - Well plates were coated with poly - L - lysine 1 : 1 diluted with H 2 O ( Sigma P4707 0 , 01 % solution ) and incubated overnight at 37 °C . The next day the plate was washed once with PBS , and transfected HEK 293T cells were seeded at a density of 6 (cid:3) 10 5 / well . About 30 h after the transfection cells were cooled on ice for 10 – 15 min . The medium was replaced with DFH medium ( 1 % FCS and 20 m M HEPES in RPMI 1640 ) containing 1 : 750 mouse anti - V5 anti - body ( Serotec , MCA - 1360 ) . The cells were incubated for 30 – 60 min at 4 °C and then washed 3 times with cold DFHI - medium ( 1 % FCS and 25 m M HEPES in RPMI 1640 ) . To induce internalization , cells were incubated with warm DFHII medium ( 1 % FCS and 5 m M HEPES in RPMI 1640 ) fo r 1 h at 37 °C . The cells were fixed with 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min , washed twice with PBS , and kept overnight at 4 °C . For blocking , 2 % normal goat serum ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) in PBS was used for at least 30 min . After washing once with PBS , the cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium with alkaline phosphatase - coupled anti - mouse antibody ( dilution 1 : 7500 ) for 1 h and washed 3 times with PBS , each wash 5 – 10 min . The cells were then incubated with p - nitrophenyl phosphate ( Sigma , N2765 ; one tablet was resuspended in 20 ml of 0 . 1 M glycine , 1 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M ZnCl 2 , pH 10 . 4 ) for abou t 1 h at 37 °C or until the solution turned yellow . One aliquot ( 100 (cid:3) l ) from the reaction was transferred in a 96 - well plate , and the extinction was measured at 405 nm in a microplate reader . CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) and CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes were treated for inhibition of CIN85 / Ruk L expression as mentioned above , and nephrin endocytosis was measured by the same method . Biotinylation of Nephrin —CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) and CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podo - cytes were seeded on plates and differentiated for 14 days . For biotinylation , cells were cooled at 4 °C for 30 min to stop endo - cytosis . After that cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C for endocytosis of nephrin or remained at 4 °C as control . Cells were then washed 3 times with ice - cold PBS containing 1 m M MgCl 2 and 0 . 1 m M CaCl 2 to remove soluble proteins . 80 (cid:3) l of 10 m M Sulfo - NHS - SS - Biotin ( Pierce ) per ml of PBS were added to the cells and incubated at room temperature for 30 min . After incubation cells were washed once with ice - cold PBS , and non - reacting biotinylation reagent was quenched by incubation with 50 m M Tris , pH 8 . 0 , followed by three washes in ice - cold PBS . Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C , and the resulting supernatant was incu - bated with 50 (cid:3) l of 50 % streptavidin - agarose ( Thermo Scien - tific , Waltham , MA ) and kept rotating overnight at 4 °C . After that the beads were washed five times with RIPA buffer , bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer by boiling for 5 min , and supernatant was loaded on SDS - gels . Biotinylated nephrin was analyzed by immunoblotting . Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry —After dis - section , kidneys were flushed with PBS and immediately frozen in tissue molds containing optimal cutting temperature com - pound . Sections were blocked with 10 % normal donkey serum and stained with the appropriate primary antibody followed by Cy3 - conjugated donkey anti - mouse , Cy3 - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit , or fluorescein isothiocyanate - conjugated donkey anti guinea pig antibodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . For light microscopy the tissue was perfusion - fixed . One - microme - ter paraffin sections were deparaffinized , and antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving ( 10 m M citrate buffer , pH 6 . 1 ) or by protease digestion ( protease XXIV , 5 mg / ml or protease XIV , 10 (cid:3) g / ml ) ( Sigma ) . Unspecific binding was blocked ( 5 % human serum , 30 min , room temperature ) . Primary antibody incubations ( 5 % human serum , overnight , 4 °C ) were followed by incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody ( 1 : 400 , 30 min , room temperature ) . Color development was performed with the ABC - AP kit ( Vector , Burlingame , CA ) The immuno - histochemical protocol was performed as described earlier ( 21 ) . For IgG controls , sections were incubated with rabbit or mouse IgG instead of the primary antibody . Statistics —Data are shown as the mean (cid:4) S . D . and were compared by Student’s t test .

RESULTS The Onset of Proteinuria in CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) Mice Correlates with an Increased Accumulation of Ubiquitinated Proteins and CIN85 / Ruk L Expression in Podocytes —A recent study revealed that the ubiquitin system is involved in nephrin internalization in podocytes in various diseases with podocyte injury ( 21 ) . To test whether ubiquitination would play a role in the CD2AP - deficient mice , we performed immunohistochemical staining against ubiquitin that revealed an increase of ubiquitin - positive podocytes in diseased CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice compared with CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice . To exclude nonspecific binding , the primary antibody was replaced by rabbit IgG ( Fig . 1 A ) . Immunofluores - cence staining of frozen kidney cortex sections shows an increased number of ubiquitin - and CIN85 / Ruk L - positive podocytes in 18 - day - old CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice that partially colocal - ized with nephrin ( Fig . 1 B ) . Nephrin staining was significantly reduced and displayed a typical speckled expression pattern , which is characteristic in a variety of proteinuric diseases and usually coincides with foot process effacement . In contrast to CIN85 / Ruk L Mediates Slit Diaphragm Turnover in Podocytes AUGUST 13 , 2010• VOLUME 285•NUMBER 33 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 25287 by gu e s t on J un e 20 , 2014 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m that , we could not detect ubiquitin - and CIN85 / Ruk L - positive podocytes in age - matched CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) or healthy ( non - protein - uric ) 14 - day - old CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . To exclude nonspecific binding of the primary antibody , the staining was performed with rabbit or with mouse IgG ( Fig . 1 , B and C ) . Interestingly , when we examined spot urine samples of CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) and CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice over time we found that the increase of ubiq - uitin - positive expressing cells coincides with the onset of pro - teinuria in CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice 18 ( (cid:2) / (cid:1) 1 ) days after birth ( n (cid:6) 5 ) ( Fig . 1 D ) . Moreover , by Western blot we could show an increased accumula - tion of ubiquitinated proteins in kidneys of diseased CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice as well as in cultured CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes ( Fig . 1 E ) . These data indicate that podocyte injury and proteinuria in this model system are accompanied by an increased accumulation of ubiquiti - nated proteins and CIN85 / Ruk L expression and in parallel reduced nephrin expression coinciding with the onset of proteinuria . Nephrin and Podocin Are Early - ubiquitinated in CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) Podocytes in Vitro in Response to FGF — Because CIN85 / Ruk L , which we found up - regulated in CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes as early as 4 days after differentiation ( 12 ) , is involved in ubiquitin - mediated endocytosis and down - regulation of receptor - tyrosine kinases , we wanted to ana - lyze the possible ubiquitination of nephrin and podocin in CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) and CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes . Since we did not detect a significant amount of ubiquitination of neph - rin and podocin at base line ( data not shown ) , we examined the ubiq - uitination profiles of nephrin and podocin after growth factor stimu - lation . Because it was shown that phosphorylated nephrin associates with adaptor proteins like Grb2 , Nck , and phospholipase C - (cid:2) 1 , which are recruited after FGF treat - ment to the activated receptor ( 10 , 22 , 23 ) , we treated CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) and CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes with FGF - 4 for 0 , 0 . 5 , 1 , and 2 h and performed immunoprecipitation of endoge - nous nephrin and podocin . Interest - ingly , when we analyzed the precip - itates for ubiquitin by Western blotting , we found ubiquitination of nephrin as early as after 1 h ( Fig . 2 A ) and ubiquitination of podocin as early as 30 min after FGF stim - ulation in CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes compared with CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) podocytes ( Fig . 2 B ) . In CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) podocytes we found no ubiquitination of nephrin , and we could only detect a weak ubiquitination response of podocin after 2 h ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Similarly , we could demonstrate an inducible recruitment of CIN85 / Ruk L to nephrin and podocin after 30 min until 1 h of stimulation with FGF - 4 ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . To confirm that ubiq - CIN85 / Ruk L Mediates Slit Diaphragm Turnover in Podocytes 25288 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 285•NUMBER 33• AUGUST 13 , 2010 by gu e s t on J un e 20 , 2014 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m uitination of nephrin and podocin is dependent on CIN85 / Ruk L expression , we inhibited expression of CIN85 / Ruk L protein by siRNA in CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes . When we analyzed the precip - itates for ubiquitin by Western blot , we found no ubiquitination of nephrin and a weak ubiquitination of podocin afte r 2 h of stimulation with FGF - 4 in CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes treated with a CIN85 / Ruk L siRNA , whereas treatment of the cells with a con - trol siRNA showed strong ubiquitination of nephrin after 1 h and for podocin after 30 min of stimulation ( Fig . 2 C ) . These results suggest that ubiquitination of both slit diaphragm pro - teins occurs accelerated in differentiated CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes and is dependent on CIN85 / Ruk L expression . CIN85 / RUK L Is a Novel Binding Partner of Nephrin and Podocin and Binds to the Same Region as CD2AP —CD2AP interacts with nephrin and podocin and forms a complex that participates in common signaling pathways like phosphatidyl - inositol 3 - kinase activation ( 4 , 5 ) . Because CIN85 / Ruk L con - tains , except for the actin binding sites , identical binding domains , we wanted to examine if CIN85 / Ruk L would bind to nephrin and podocin as well . To dissect the possible interaction of CIN85 / Ruk L with nephrin and podocin , we coexpressed dif - ferent isoforms and deletion mutants of CIN85 / Ruk L with the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase , CD2AP , nephrin , and podocin in HEK 293T cells . We used expression plasmids encoding various CIN85 / Ruk isoforms and deletion mutants with FLAG tag : Ruk L ( full - length ) , Ruk (cid:7) A ( lacks SH3A ) , Ruk m ( lacks SH3A - B ) , Ruk e ( lacks SH3A - C and a specific part of the proline - rich region ) , Ruk h ( lacks SH3A - C and the whole pro - line - rich region ) , Ruk (cid:7) C - T ( lacks the C - terminal end ) and Ruk (cid:7) CC ( lacks the coiled - coil domain ) . To test the binding integrity of our constructs we used the known interaction of CIN85 / Ruk L and p85 as a test system ( Fig . 3 a ) . We can detect , as previously described , that p85 binds to the proline - rich region of CIN85 / Ruk L ( 24 ) , which is lacking in the Ruk e and Ruk h constructs . When we looked for the known interaction of CD2AP and CIN85 / Ruk L ( 25 ) we found that the coiled - coil domain that is missing in Ruk (cid:7) C - T and Ruk (cid:7) CC is required for CD2AP and CIN85 / Ruk L interaction ( Fig . 3 b ) . When we per - formed coexpression and co - immunoprecipitation experi - ments with nephrin and podocin , we can demonstrate that both interact with CIN85 / Ruk L and that the integrity of the coiled - coil domains is essential for this association ( Fig . 3 , c and d ) . There is no binding of nephrin and podocin to CIN85 / Ruk mutants lacking the coiled - coil domain or the whole C termi - nus of CIN85 / Ruk L . To support our data that CIN85 / Ruk L binding is required for ubiquitination of nephrin and podocin in podocytes , we overexpressed Ruk L and Ruk (cid:7) CT in CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) podocytes , and we can demonstrate that Ruk L over - expression leads to a strong and early ubiquitination response of nephrin and podocin . In contrast , in the presence of the C - terminal mutant , which is unable to bind to nephrin and podocin , we detect a weaker ubiquitination of nephrin at 2 h and no ubiquitination response of podocin ( Fig . 3 , e and f ) . The weak ubiquitination response of nephrin in the presence of Ruk (cid:7) CT is particularly interesting . There are two potential explanations for this finding . It either indicates an effect that is mediated by endogenous CIN85 / Ruk L in wild type cells or a partial binding of the Ruk (cid:7) CT to endogenous nephrin that is still sufficient to induce ubiquitination . This binding could be directly or mediated by a different component of the slit dia - phragm multiprotein complex . In summary , these results define CIN85 / Ruk L as a novel binding partner of the slit diaphragm proteins nephrin and podocin . The site of interaction with both molecules is identical to the interaction site of CD2AP . Furthermore , ubiquitination of nephrin and podocin is dependent on CIN85 / Ruk L binding . CIN85 / Ruk L Enhances Endocytosis of Nephrin and Podocin — To study endocytosis of nephrin in the presence of CIN85 / Ruk L on a quantitative level , we performed an enzyme - linked immu - nosorbent assay - based endocytosis assay . To accomplish that , we transiently transfected HEK 293T cells with Nephrin - SV5 and GFPN1 empty vector , CD2AP - GFP , podocin - GFP , or CIN85 - GFP ( kindly provided by I . Dikic . We could demon - strate a significant enhancement of nephrin endocytosis in the presence of CIN85 / Ruk L . Overexpression of CIN85 / Ruk L resulted in a more than 2 - fold increase in nephrin endocytosis compared with cells co - transfected with GFPN1 empty vector , CD2AP - GFP , or podocin - GFP .

Control lysates show equal expression of proteins ( Fig . 4 B , upper panel ) . To see whether endocytosis of endogenous expressed nephrin is equally enhanced in differentiated CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes and depends on CIN85 / Ruk L expression , we treated CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) and CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes with a CIN85 / Ruk L siRNA and applied the same assay labeling endogenous nephrin . We could detect a more than 2 - fold increase in nephrin endocytosis in CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes treated with a control siRNA compared with CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes treated with a CIN85 / Ruk L siRNA . Endocytosis of nephrin in CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) podocytes is significantly lower compared with CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes , whereas there is no difference between CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) podocytes treated with a control or CIN85 / Ruk L siRNA .

Control lysates show inhibited expression of CIN85 / Ruk L and expres - sion of CD2AP ( Fig . 4 C , upper panel ) . To confirm this result with a different method , we performed a surface biotinylation assay . Again we were able to detect a significant enhancement of nephrin endocytosis in the CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes ( white bar , left panel ) ( Fig . 4 D , left panel ; * , p (cid:5) 0 . 005 , CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podo - cytes versus CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) podocytes ) . To confirm the data that endocytosis of nephrin in CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes is dependent on CIN85 / Ruk L expression , we inhibited expression of CIN85 / Ruk L . CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes treated with a CIN85 / Ruk L siRNA ( black bar , right panel ) showed a decreased endocytosis of nephrin compared with CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes treated with a control siRNA ( white bar ) , whereas CIN85 / Ruk L expression is not inhibited ( Fig . 4 D , right panel ; * , p (cid:5) 0 . 04 , CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podo - cytes treated with control siRNA versus CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes treated with CIN85 / Ruk L siRNA ) . These data suggest that in the presence of CIN85 / Ruk L nephrin endocytosis is enhanced . In the Presence of CIN85 / Ruk L Nephrin and Podocin Are Internalized and Colocalized in Intracellular Vesicles after Growth Factor Stimulation —Former studies indicate that CIN85 / Ruk L can act as a linker between Cbl and endophilin and is recruited upon EGF stimulation to the EGF receptor , which leads to receptor endocytosis ( 16 ) . Other studies show that CIN85 / Ruk L is associated with the Golgi complex , which takes part in membrane trafficking ( 26 , 27 ) . We overexpressed CIN85 - GFP with (cid:1) 1 , 4 - galactotransferase - pDsRed , a Golgi - as - sociated protein , in CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) podocyte and stimulated the cells for 60 min with FGF - 4 . By confocal microscopy we could show vesicle formation and colocalization of CIN85 / Ruk L ( green ) with the Golgi - associated protein ( red ) ( Fig . 5 A ) , whereas the distribution of CD2AP ( green ) after FGF - 4 stimu - lation remains the same , and no obvious colocalization of CD2AP ( green ) with the Golgi complex ( red ) is detectable ( Fig . 5 B ) . To visualize that nephrin trafficking from the membrane into the cell after FGF - 4 stimulation depends on CIN85 / Ruk L expression , we transiently overexpressed Nephrin - SV5 with CIN85 - GFP in CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) podocytes . We simultaneously stained the living cells and stimulated them with FGF - 4 ( 20 ng / ml ) for 60 min . We found that , in contrast to unstimulated cells where nephrin ( red ) is expressed alongside the cell mem - brane , stimulated cells displayed a vesicle - like , perinuclear dis - tribution pattern for nephrin that significantly colocalized with CIN85 - GFP ( Fig . 5 C ) . Compared with that , nephrin remained at the cell surface after stimulation with FGF - 4 in podocytes transfected with an empty GFP expression plasmid ( Fig . 5 D ) . These data indicate that expression of CIN85 / Ruk L leads to internalization of nephrin after FGF - 4 treatment and enrich - FIGURE 2 .

Moreover , the CIN85 / Ruk L - dependent trafficking of nephrin takes place at the Golgi complex . Functional Competition between CD2AP and CIN85 / Ruk L for Bind - ing to Nephrin and Podocin —Since we demonstrate that nephrin , podo - cin , and CD2AP bind to the same region of CIN85 / Ruk L , we wanted to examine if CD2AP and CIN85 / Ruk L compete for binding to neph - rin and podocin . To test that , we coexpressed CD2AP with CIN85 / Ruk L and nephrin or podocin in HEK 293T cells . When we precipi - tated CIN85 / Ruk L , we could detect a strong binding of CIN85 / Ruk L with nephrin ; however , in the pres - ence of CD2AP this binding was sig - nificantly reduced ( Fig . 6 a ) . As a control , overexpression of p85 had no effect on nephrin binding . Simi - larly , when we precipitated for over - expressed nephrin , we could clearly detect binding of CIN85 / Ruk L in the absence of CD2AP ; however , when we coexpressed CD2AP , the binding of CIN85 / Ruk L to nephrin was significantly reduced ( Fig . 6 b ) . Similarly , when we performed the same series of experiments for podocin , we detected a strong bind - ing of podocin and CIN85 / Ruk L in the absence of CD2AP ; however , in the presence of CD2AP , this bind - ing was significantly reduced ( Fig . 6 , c and d ) . These results indicate functional competition of CD2AP and CIN85 / Ruk L for binding to nephrin and podocin . When both proteins are coexpressed , nephrin and podocin bind preferentially to CD2AP . DISCUSSION The podocyte slit diaphragm is a delicate extracellular protein struc - ture that has to withstand blood pressure - associated changes in the glomerular perfusion pressure and , thus , requires constant renewal . Podocytes can retract and reform their foot processes in response to several cellular stresses ( 28 ) . These dynamics require a tightly regulated interplay of signaling adaptors that orchestrate the tight regulation of protein trafficking and turnover . The nephrin - podocin receptor complex is the backbone of the zipper - like structure of the slit diaphragm ( 3 ) . Given its structure and its localization , it is not surprising that this complex has signal FIGURE 3 . CIN85 / Ruk L interacts with nephrin and podocin at the coiled - coil domain .

The scaf - folding molecule CD2AP has an important role for intracellular receptor - mediated signaling ( 29 ) . In addition to its described sig - naling functions in combination with the slit diaphragm complex and growth factor receptors ( 5 , 30 , 31 ) it serves as a linker to the cytoskeleton . ThedeficiencyofCD2APinmicecausesanephrotic syndrome similar to nephrin defi - ciency . However , in contrast to neph - rin - deficient mice , CD2AP - deficient mice are born healthy and die at 6 weeks of age ( 11 ) , whereas nephrin deficiency in mice is fatal in their first days of life ( 6 ) . We and others observed that normal foot processes and slit diaphragms are formed inde - pendently of CD2AP ( 6 , 11 , 12 ) . Therefore , CD2AP seems not to be an indispensible component for slit diaphragm development but apparently for maintaining the filtration slit . Because we could show that in diseased CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , CIN85 / Ruk L , a protein that belongs to the same adaptor pro - tein family as CD2AP , is up - regu - lated in podocytes ( 12 ) , we wanted to investigate if the dysregulated CIN85 / Ruk L expression is the factor that destabilizes the slit diaphragm by enhanced endo - cytosis of the nephrin - podocin receptor - complex . First , we detected an increase of ubiquitin - and CIN85 / Ruk L - positive podocytes in diseased CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice that correlates with the beginning of proteinuria . Furthermore , we could show by Western blot an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in diseased kidneys of CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice and in cultured CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes ( Fig . 1 ) . These findings are in line with a recently published work where an increase in podocytic ubiquitin C - terminal hydrolase ( UCH - L1 ) and ubiquitin content was demonstrated in a subset of glo - merulopathies that correlated with an internalization of nephrin and podocin ( 21 ) . Therefore , an acti - vated ubiquitination system is a rel - evant process in human diseases as well . Our in vitro data confirmed that nephrin and podocin are early ubiquitinated after growth factor stimulation in CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) com - pared with CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) podocytes . To strengthen the data that ubiquitination of nephrin and podocin depends on CIN85 / Ruk L we inhibited CIN85 / Ruk L expression in CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes , and we could show a decreased ubiquitination of nephrin and podocin when CIN85 / Ruk L expression is inhibited ( Fig . 2 ) . Cell surface transmembrane molecules are primarily ubiquitinated , which alters their subcellular localization or tar - FIGURE4 . EndocytosisofnephrinisenhancedinthepresenceofCIN85 / Ruk L .

CIN85 / Ruk L Mediates Slit Diaphragm Turnover in Podocytes 25292 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 285•NUMBER 33• AUGUST 13 , 2010 by gu e s t on J un e 20 , 2014 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m gets them for degradation . We hypothesize that because of increased ubiquitination of nephrin and podocin the slit dia - phragm in CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) is destabilized . Because CIN85 / Ruk L is described as the mediator of ubiquitin - mediated endocytosis of the EGF receptor ( 16 ) , we had to explore first whether CIN85 / Ruk L interacts with nephrin and podocin . To test that , we over - expressed nephrin and podocin with several isoforms and dele - tion constructs of CIN85 / Ruk L , and we detected a specific binding of both nephrin and podocin to CIN85 / Ruk L ( Fig . 3 ) . Because no association of nephrin and podocin can be detected with the (cid:7) C - T and (cid:7) CC constructs , we postulate that the coiled - coil domain of CIN85 / Ruk L is required for binding to nephrin and podocin . It is shown by various groups that the coiled - coil domain participates in endocytosis and is essential for the whole process ( 32 – 36 ) . Interestingly , as previously described , CD2AP binds to the same region of CIN85 / Ruk L , and coexpression of both molecules leads to formation of heterotypic complexes ( 37 ) . Whether this binding would also influence the abundance of free CIN85 / Ruk L in the pres - ence of CD2AP remains unclear . Interestingly , transient transfection of the C - terminal deletion mutant of Ruk L leads to a decreased ubiquitination of nephrin and podocin com - pared with full - length Ruk L ( Fig . 3 ) . This is in line with other studies where it is shown that the coiled - coil domain is needed for down - regulation of the EGF receptor ( 38 , 39 ) . To further investigate a possible CIN85 / Ruk L - dependent endocytosis of nephrin in a quantitative way , we performed an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay - based endo - cytosis assay that measured nephrin surface expression . Overexpression of nephrin with CIN85 / Ruk L led to enhanced endocytosis of nephrin compared with coexpression of nephrin with CD2AP , podocin , Ruk (cid:7) CT , and Ruk (cid:7) CC and coexpres - sion of Ruk L with CD2AP in HEK 293T cells . Furthermore , endocyto - sis of endogenous expressed neph - rinatthesurfaceofCD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podo - cytes is enhanced compared with CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) and CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podo - cytes treated with a CIN85 / Ruk L siRNA . Additionally , a biotinylation of surface - expressed nephrin con - firmed that the remaining nephrin at the surface of podocytes is dra - matically decreased in CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) compared with CD2AP (cid:2) / (cid:2) and CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) podocytes treated with a CIN85 / Ruk L siRNA ( Fig . 4 ) . Immunofluorescence assays by con - focal microscopy revealed that nephrin is internalized in the pres - ence of CIN85 / Ruk L after growth factor stimulation . Interestingly , we observed colocalization of nephrin with CIN85 / Ruk L and prominent vesicle formations at the perinuclear area ( Fig . 5 ) , which is char - acteristic for activated receptors that are down - regulated by endocytosis and subsequently degraded in lysosomes ( 40 ) . Interestingly , we can show a colocalization of CIN85 / Ruk L with the Golgi complex after stimulation with FGF - 4 . Other studies showed that CIN85 / Ruk L associated with the Golgi complex and could , therefore , take part in trafficking of receptors ( 27 ) . Furthermore , it has been demonstrated that ubiquitin mediates sorting of proteins from the trans - Golgi network to the endo - somes , thereby preventing their appearance on the cell surface and hastening their degradation in the lysosome vacuole ( 41 ) . Further experiments to elucidate the candidate machinery in nephrin trafficking are ongoing studies in our laboratory . We further hypothesized that CD2AP and CIN85 / Ruk L compete for binding to nephrin and podocin as it is known that nephrin also interacts with the C - terminal ending of CD2AP ( 42 ) . To demonstrate a competition of CD2AP and CIN85 / Ruk L for binding to nephrin and podocin , we performed coexpression experiments . When we examined nephrin and podocin bind - ing after co - immunoprecipitation , we detected that both molecules would preferentially bind to CD2AP when CD2AP is coexpressed with CIN85 / Ruk L ( Fig . 6 ) . The domain organization of CIN85 / Ruk L is identical to that of CD2AP ( 25 ) . The similarity is not only restricted to the gen - eral organization . CIN85 / Ruk L is the only known protein that has amino acid homology to CD2AP outside the SH3 FIGURE5 . NephrinisinternalizedaftergrowthfactorstimulationinthepresenceofCIN85 / Ruk L .

Interestingly , it was shown by others that inter - action of CIN85 / Ruk L with phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase leads to inhibition ( 24 ) and binding of CD2AP to phospha - tidylinositol 3 - kinase leads to enhancement of the lipid kinase activity ( 4 ) . In summary , our presented data define a previously unde - scribed dynamic concept of the glomerular filtration slit . In the absence of CD2AP the abundance of CIN85 / Ruk L increases , and the intracellular domain of nephrin associates with CIN85 / Ruk L . Previously , it was hypothesized by others that CIN85 / Ruk L can compensate the absence of CD2AP ( 43 ) . Our data demonstrate for the first time that binding of CIN85 / Ruk L to nephrin and podocin leads to ubiquitination of both , which results in heavy proteinuria and demarcates the beginning of disease in the CD2AP (cid:1) / (cid:1) mouse ( Fig . 7 ) . It is not surprising that a receptor - like complex as the nephrin - podocin complex can undergo the same fate as other acti - vated membrane receptors , as the slit diaphragm is con - stantly exposed to a number of cytokines and toxins . It is possible that association of the nephrin - podocin complex with activated growth factors occurs and that this whole complex is internalized . This question will be addressed in further studies in our laboratory . We presume that the enhanced and constant binding of CIN85 / Ruk L to the neph - rin - podocin receptor complex leads to endocytosis and destabilization of the slit diaphragm . How much this mech - anism contributes to the normal turnover of slit diaphragm complex under physiological conditions remains unclear . Posttranslational modifications and phosphorylation of CD2AP and CIN85 / Ruk L or cleavage of CD2AP by intracel - lular enzymes are possible mechanisms that are also under current investigations in our laboratory . Those mechanisms could lead to changes in protein binding and , thus , contrib - ute to the orchestrated trafficking of the slit diaphragm .

CIN85 / Ruk L - FLAG , Nephrin - FLAG , or Podocin - FLAG was precipi - tated ( IP ) from whole cell lysates using anti - FLAG beads . The probes were analyzed for GFP or myc expression . Lysates were blotted ( WB ) and analyzed for protein content using anti - GFP , FLAG , or myc antibodies . In the presence ofCD2AP , bindingofCIN85 / Ruk L tonephrinissignificantlyreduced ( a and b ) . Similarly , thebindingofpodocintoCIN85 / Ruk L issignificantlyimpairedinthe presence of CD2AP ( c and d ) . FIGURE 7 .
