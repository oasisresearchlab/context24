Autoinhibition and post - translational modi - fication ( PTM ) are two common regulatory mechanisms . Many well - known regulatory proteins are autoinhibited 1 , requir - ing various mechanisms to release the autoinhibitory interaction . A variety of PTMs can trigger major changes in protein activity or location . Autoinhibition and PTM are both frequently involved in the regulation of the same protein 1 , 2 . Members of the formin family of actin assembly factors are key players in a diverse range of cellular functions , including cytokine - sis , cell motility , phagocytosis and organelle dynamics . Several of the 15 mammalian formins are known or predicted to be autoin - hibited 3 – 5 , with 10 mammalian formins 6 , 7 containing two autoregu - latory sequences : the amino ( N ) - terminal diaphanous inhibitory domain ( DID ) and the carboxyl ( C ) - terminal diaphanous autoregu - latory domain ( DAD ) . The autoinhibitory mechanism of one for - min , mDia1 , has been described in detail 8 . Binding of GTP - charged RhoA to the GTPase - binding domain of mDia1 activates the for - min by disrupting the interaction between DID and DAD 8 , 9 . Atomic structures have been solved for DID alone and the DID – DAD com - plex , and a single point mutation in the DAD - binding site in DID has been shown to eliminate autoinhibition 9 , 10 . INF2 is a mammalian formin that contains DID and DAD sequences . Biochemically , INF2 has multiple effects on actin 11 , 12 , as well as having both direct and indirect effects on microtubules 13 – 16 . In cells , INF2 - mediated actin polymerization plays roles in mito - chondrial fission , calcium transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria , vesicle trafficking and Golgi structure 17 – 21 . Dominant missense mutations in INF2 are linked to two dis - eases , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) 22 and Charcot – Marie – Tooth disease ( CMTD ) 23 . Interestingly , all of the more than 35 disease - linked mutations map to the DID , suggesting regula - tory effects . Few disease - associated mutations , however , are found in its DAD - binding site . Three pieces of evidence have suggested that INF2 does not engage in canonical autoinhibition . First , the DID – DAD interaction of INF2 is more than tenfold weaker than that of mDia1 ( refs . 11 , 24 , 25 ) . Second , actin monomers bind to the DAD domain of INF2 , and compete with DID 24 . Third , purified INF2 is constitutively active in biochemical actin polymerization assays 24 . Although these results suggest that INF2 is not regulated by autoinhibition , cellular studies show that INF2 is tightly regu - lated in a manner that is dependent on the interaction between DID and DAD 19 , 24 . These results suggest that an additional factor may mediate the interaction between DID and DAD in INF2 . Here we identify this factor as a complex of CAP and KAc - actin . INF2 mutants linked to FSGS and CMTD are not inhibited by CAP – actin , suggesting a mechanism for disease . Results INF2 is constitutively active in vitro but inhibited by the DID – DAD interaction in cells . INF2 has two splice variants that dif - fer in C - terminal sequence : endoplasmic reticulum – bound INF2 - CAAX 18 , 19 and cytosolic INF2 - nonCAAX 17 , 20 , 21 . We used INF2 - nonCAAX to test the regulatory mechanisms—by express - ing the human full - length protein ( INF2 - FL ; Fig . 1a ) in mammalian HEK293 cells as an N - terminally tagged fusion with green fluores - cent protein ( GFP ) and Strep - tag II ( GFP – strep ) —and purified the protein to apparent homogeneity either with or without GFP – strep ( Fig . 1b ) . INF2 was shown to be a dimer by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation ( vAUC ) , ( Fig . 1c ) . Next , we examined the effect of purified INF2 on actin dynamics , comparing INF2 - FL to a truncated INF2 construct that lacked the DID ( INF2 - FFC ) . Similarly to INF2 - FL purified from insect cells 24 , HEK293 - purified INF2 - FL accelerates actin polymerization from monomers with comparable potency to INF2 - FFC ( Fig . 1d ) . These results show that purified INF2 is not autoinhibited . We also tested the effect of GFP – INF2 - nonCAAX on cytosolic actin polymerization in U2OS cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Wild - type ( WT ) INF2 causes no apparent increase in cytoplasmic actin filaments , whereas expression of a DID mutant predicted to disrupt the interaction between DID and DAD ( INF2 - A149D ) increases cytoplasmic actin filaments significantly ( Supplementary Fig . 1b , c ) . These results agree with previous findings 24 , and suggest that INF2 A complex containing lysine - acetylated actin inhibits the formin INF2 Mu A , Tak Shun Fung , Arminja N . Kettenbach , Rajarshi Chakrabarti and Henry N . Higgs * Inverted formin 2 ( INF2 ) is a member of the formin family of actin assembly factors . Dominant missense mutations in INF2 are linked to two diseases : focal segmental glomerulosclerosis , a kidney disease , and Charcot – Marie – Tooth disease , a neuropathy . All of the disease mutations map to the autoinhibitory diaphanous inhibitory domain . Interestingly , purified INF2 is not auto - inhibited , suggesting the existence of other cellular inhibitors . Here , we purified an INF2 inhibitor from mouse brain tissue , and identified it as a complex of lysine - acetylated actin ( KAc - actin ) and cyclase - associated protein ( CAP ) . Inhibition of INF2 by CAP – KAc - actin is dependent on the INF2 diaphanous inhibitory domain ( DID ) . Treatment of CAP – KAc - actin - inhibited INF2 with histone deacetylase 6 releases INF2 inhibition , whereas inhibitors of histone deacetylase 6 block the activation of cellular INF2 . Disease - associated INF2 mutants are poorly inhibited by CAP – KAc - actin , suggesting that focal segmental glomerulo - sclerosis and Charcot – Marie – Tooth disease result from reduced CAP – KAc - actin binding . These findings reveal a role for KAc - actin in the regulation of an actin assembly factor by a mechanism that we call facilitated autoinhibition .

One explanation could be that a cellular factor facilitates the interaction between DID and DAD . In this study , we identified such a factor . Identification of an INF2 inhibitory protein .

NATuRe Cell BIology | VOL 21 | MAY 2019 | 592 – 602 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 593 Articles NATure Cell BIology mixing chromatographic fractions from mouse brain with purified INF2 - FL , then assaying the rate of actin polymerization . We made two assumptions : ( 1 ) the inhibitor would be cytosolic , because both INF2 - CAAX and INF2 - nonCAAX are inhibited in cells ; and ( 2 ) the inhibitor would be abundant , because even cells that strongly overexpress INF2 - WT do not display aberrant actin polymerization ( Supplementary Fig . 1b , c ) . We used five chromatographic steps in the purification pro - cess ( Fig . 1f ) , assessing INF2 - FL inhibition through a pyrene – actin polymerization assay ( Fig . 1g , h , Supplementary Fig . 2a – c ) . In the final step , inhibitory activity eluted with the major protein peak ( Fig . 1i ) . We refer to this fraction as ‘brain inhibitory frac - tion’ ( BIF ) . Importantly , BIF does not inhibit actin polymerization by INF2 - FFC ( Fig . 1h , i ) or mDia1 - FFC ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) , demonstrating that it is not acting as a general inhibitor of actin polymerization . The inability of BIF to inhibit INF2 - FFC also dem - onstrates that DID is required for inhibition . In addition , BIF does not cause significant INF2 proteolysis ( Supplementary Fig . 2e ) , sug - gesting that the inhibitor is not a protease . Furthermore , BIF loses all activity after being subjected to boiling ( Supplementary Fig . 2f ) . These experiments reveal a cytosolic protein inhibitor of INF2 that requires the DID domain of INF2 for inhibition . The CAP – actin complex is an INF2 inhibitor . Five visible bands were identified in the BIF by SDS – PAGE and silver staining ( Fig . 1j ) as follows : band 1 , exportin1 / 7 ; band 2 , heat - shock cognate 71 kDa protein ( HSP7C ) and vacuolar ATPase subunit A ( VATA ) ; band 3 , cyclase - associated proteins 1 ( CAP1 ) and 2 ( CAP2 ) and vacuolar ATPase subunit B2 ( VATB2 ) ; band 4 , CAP2 , CAP1 and VATA ; and band 5 , actin ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . We immuno - depleted individual proteins from BIF and tested the ability of the proteins in these depleted fractions to inhibit INF2 - FL . Depletion of CAP2 eliminates INF2 inhibition ( Fig . 2a , b ) , whereas the depletion of VATA , VATB2 or HSP7C has no effect ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Available antibodies against CAP1 and exportin proved unsuitable for depletion . These results suggest that CAP2 is required for INF2 inhibition by BIF . As additional inhibitory peaks were identified in the first two purification steps ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) , we used western blot - ting to determine whether CAP1 or CAP2 was present in these frac - tions . CAP1 and CAP2 were both detected in inhibitory fractions by using anion - exchange chromatography ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) and size - exclusion chromatography ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . These results suggest that endogenous CAP complexes are heterogeneous in size , but that all CAP - containing peaks can inhibit INF2 . a b d c e f IP : NS I npu t I B : C AP 2 100 75 50 37 CAP2 200 250 CAP – GFP Untagged CAP Actin 150 100 75 50 INF2 - FL + IP / CAP2 - Sup INF2 - FL + CAP2 INF2 - FFC + CAP2 BIFRecombinant CAP2 INF2 - FL alone INF2 - FL + IP / NS - Sup FL INF2 - FL INF2 - FFC Actin Actin Actin Actin Time ( s ) P o l y m e r i z ed a c t i n ( a . u . ) P o l y m e r i z ed a c t i n ( a . u . ) P o l y m e r i z ed a c t i n ( a . u . ) I N F 2 - F L a c t i v i t y ( a . u . ) CAP concentration ( nM ) 160 120 80 40 200 250 20 15 10 5 0 200 150 100 50 160 120 80 40 0 200 400 600 800 1 , 000 Time ( s ) Time ( s ) 0 200 400 600 800 1 , 000 1 , 200 0 200 400 600 800 1 , 000 0 1 , 000 2 , 000 3 , 000 4 , 000 5 , 000 1 , 200 IgGH I P - pe ll e t I P - s upe r na t an t I P - pe ll e t I P - s upe r na t an t IP : CAP2 ( kDa ) ( kDa ) Fig . 2 | CAP – actin is an INF2 inhibitor . a , Immunodepletion of CAP2 .

NATuRe Cell BIology | VOL 21 | MAY 2019 | 592 – 602 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 594 Articles NATure Cell BIology To further test CAP as an INF2 inhibitor , we purified recom - binant human CAP—containing C - terminal GFP and Strep - tag II ( CAP – GFP ) —from HEK293 cells . We purified three versions of CAP : CAP1 , CAP2 , and coexpressed CAP1 and CAP2 . When ana - lysed by SDS – PAGE , all CAP – GFP fusion proteins contained two additional bands : untagged CAP and actin ( Fig . 2c , Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . The mean molar ratio of untagged CAP to CAP – GFP was 0 . 16 in all cases , whereas the mean actin : CAP – GFP ratio was 0 . 88 ( Table 1 ) . Quantification of the protein bands in the BIF revealed an actin : CAP ratio of around 1 : 1 ( Table 1 ) . CAP elutes as a high - mass particle by gel filtration ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) , and CAP – GFP sediments as a 14 . 5 S particle by vAUC , with a calculated molecular mass of 726 kDa ( Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . Considering past stud - ies that have shown CAP hexamerization 26 , 27 , we interpret our puri - fied CAP – GFP to be a hexamer with a 5 : 1 ratio of CAP – GFP to untagged CAP ( likely endogenous HEK293 CAP ) , and an actin monomer bound to a mean of five CAP subunits . Recombinant CAP – actin inhibits actin polymerization by INF2 - FL ( Fig . 2d ) but not by INF2 - FFC ( Fig . 2e , Supplementary Fig . 4f ) . However , the inhibitory potency of recombinant CAP – actin is substantially lower than that of BIF ( Fig . 2f ) . The half - maximum inhibitory concentration ( IC 50 ) for CAP in BIF is 69 nM , whereas recombinant CAP does not reach its IC 50 at the maximum concentration tested . We obtained similar results for recombi - nant CAP1 – actin and CAP2 – actin , both with and without GFP ( Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . In the absence of INF2 , CAP – actin has little effect on actin polymerization at the highest concentration tested ( Supplementary Fig . 4e ) . These results suggest that CAP is a component of the INF2 inhibitory factor , although recombinant CAP does not inhibit maximally . Actin is an important component of CAP - mediated INF2 inhi - bition . We reasoned that the difference in inhibition between recombinant CAP and BIF might be due to differences in the bound actin . Therefore , we attempted to exchange actin in our recombi - nant CAP – actin ( hereafter called CAP – 293A ) with other types of actin . We first tested actin exchange on CAP by mixing immobi - lized CAP – 293A with fluorescently labelled actin ( tetramethylrho - damine - succinimide ; TMR – actin ) and monitoring bead - bound fluorescence ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . An appreciable level of fluo - rescent actin was associated with the CAP – 293A - bound beads , but not with control GFP beads ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . The ratio of actin : CAP is not changed significantly compared with the mock - exchanged CAP ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . These results show that actin monomers can exchange onto CAP . We exchanged CAP with total brain actin ( BA ; Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . CAP – BA displays significantly more INF2 inhibition ( IC 50 = 54 nM ) than CAP – 293A ( Fig . 3a , b ) , but does not inhibit INF2 - FFC ( Fig . 3c ) . We next exchanged CAP with two types of skeletal muscle actin , from chicken ( CSKA ) or rabbit ( RSKA ) . Interestingly , CAP – CSKA inhibits INF2 - FL with an IC 50 close to that of CAP – BA ( IC 50 = 254 nM ; Fig . 3d , e ) , but does not inhibit INF2 - FFC ( Supplementary Fig . 4f ) . By contrast , CAP – RSKA is a poor INF2 inhibitor , similar to CAP – 293A ( Fig . 3d , e ) . These results show that the source of the CAP - bound actin significantly affects INF2 inhibition . We next investigated whether INF2 binds to CAP – actin directly . First , we used a cellular co - immunoprecipitation ( co - IP ) approach , transfecting U2OS cells with GFP – INF2 , then conducting anti - GFP IP and probing for CAP . CAP2 coprecipitates with GFP – INF2 - FL but neither with GFP – INF2 - FFC nor with INF2 - FL - A149D ( Fig . 3f ) . We also analysed the INF2 – CAP interaction using purified proteins , by incubating immobilized GFP – INF2 - FL or GFP – INF2 - FFC with CAP – CSKA in solution , then analysing the bead - asso - ciated CAP . CAP associates with INF2 - FL to a greater extent than INF2 - FFC ( Fig . 3g , h ) . These results suggest that CAP – actin inhib - its INF2 by direct interaction . Furthermore , CAP – CSKA binds to INF2 better than CAP – 293A ( Fig . 3i ) , consistent with their differ - ent inhibitory potencies . These results suggest that the interaction between DID and DAD enhances INF2 binding to CAP – actin , and that INF2 – CAP interaction requires a specific type of actin . Profilin is an abundant cytosolic actin - binding protein , and a substantial proportion of cytosolic actin monomer is profilin - bound 28 . In addition , profilin binds CAP 29 . We tested the effect of profilin on INF2 inhibition by CAP – CSKA . Through a pyrene – actin polymerization assay , we found that CAP – CSKA still potently inhibits INF2 in the presence of profilin ( Supplementary Fig . 5d ) , even though profilin slows overall actin polymerization signifi - cantly . We also conducted total internal reflection ( TIRF ) micros - copy assays of INF2 - mediated actin polymerization in the presence of profilin to distinguish between effects on actin nucleation and elongation . INF2 significantly increases nucleation rate ( Fig . 4a , b ) , and increases the filament elongation rate approximately twofold ( Fig . 4c ) . CAP – CSKA eliminates the INF2 effect on nucleation , but does not substantially affect nucleation of profilin and actin alone ( Fig . 4a , b ) . CAP – CSKA has little effect on the profilin – actin elonga - tion rate , but inhibits profilin – actin elongation in the presence of INF2 ( Fig . 4c ) . These results show that INF2 inhibition by CAP – actin can occur in the presence of profilin . Actin acetylation increases INF2 inhibition by CAP – actin . Next , we probed the mechanism behind the differing inhibitory potencies of CAP – CSKA and CAP – RSKA . Actin is highly conserved . In par - ticular , CSKA and RSKA are 100 % identical in amino acid sequence . One possible explanation for the inhibitory variation between CSKA and RSKA is differential actin PTM . We identified acetylation of several actin lysine residues for CAP – CSKA , including K50 , K61 , K326 and K328 , using mass spectrometry analysis ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . We therefore tested whether lysine acetylation of actin was required for INF2 inhibition . First , we attempted to deacetylate CAP – CSKA . Histone deacetylase 6 ( HDAC6 ) is a major cytosolic lysine deacetylase 30 . We expressed and purified Flag - tagged HDAC6 ( Supplementary Fig . 5e ) , which has substantial deacetylase activity on brain tubu - lin ( Supplementary Fig . 5f ) . In pyrene – actin polymerization assays , HDAC6 strongly reduces CAP – CSKA inhibition of INF2 , while minimally affecting the polymerization of actin alone or in the pres - ence of INF2 ( Fig . 5a ) . Pretreatment of HDAC6 with trichostatin A ( TSA ) , an HDAC inhibitor , abolishes its effect on CAP – CSKA ( Fig . 5a ) . The concentration curves of CAP – CSKA treated with HDAC6 alone versus HDAC6 and TSA show a marked difference in inhibitory activities ( Fig . 5b ) , suggesting that lysine acetylation of actin is necessary for CAP – actin inhibition of INF2 . As a second approach to test the effect of HDAC6 , we puri - fied CAP – actin from 293 cells in which HDAC6 activity was Table 1 | Molar ratios in the CAP – actin complex Mole percentage of indicated protein compared to CAP a CAP1 CAP2 CAP1 and CAP2 BIF Actin Avg ( % ) 82 . 5 88 . 1 90 . 5 106 . 8 s . d .

Cells were treated either with dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) or with the HDAC6 - specific inhibitor tubastatin A ( TubA ) , before cell extraction and protein purification . Two tests indicated the effectiveness of TubA treatment . First , acetylated tubulin in cell extracts increased substantially ( Supplementary Fig . 5g ) . Second , the amount of acetylated lysine detected on actin in purified CAP – 293A increased ( Supplementary Fig . 5h ) . TubA - treated CAP – 293A ( CAP – 293A - T ) inhibits INF2 - mediated actin polymerization with an IC 50 of 263 nM , which is substantially more potent than the DMSO - treated sample ( CAP – 293A - D ; Fig . 5c ) . These results sug - gest that ( 1 ) HDAC6 deacetylates actin in cells and ( 2 ) increased actin acetylation increases CAP – actin inhibitory potency . We used the higher inhibitory potency of CAP – 293A - T versus CAP – 293A - D to analyse the direct interaction between INF2 and CAP – actin in more detail . Analysis by vAUC showed that CAP – 293A - T causes a portion of GFP – INF2 - FL to shift to a 12 . 6 S spe - cies ( Fig . 5d , red curve ) , which is greater than that of the untagged CAP – 293A - T complex ( 11 . 2 S , grey curve ) , suggesting INF2 bind - ing to the hexameric CAP complex . CAP – 293A - D does not produce this magnitude of shift in GFP – INF2 ( Fig . 5d , blue curve ) , suggest - ing a lower affinity . In addition , CAP – 293A - T causes no shift of GFP – INF2 - FFC ( Supplementary Fig . 5i ) , suggesting that the DID is required for the high - affinity interaction . We also used fluorescence polarization of fluorescently labelled INF2 - Cterm ( amino acids 941 – 1249 of INF2 - CAAX ; containing DAD ) to examine its binding to INF2 - Nterm ( amino acids 1 – 420 ; containing DID ) in the presence or absence of CAP – 293A - T . INF2 - Cterm shows some affinity for CAP – 293A - T , with an apparent K d ( K dapp ) of 1 . 82 μ M ( Fig . 5e ) . Intriguingly , the affinity of INF2 - Cterm for INF2 - Nterm increases more than fivefold in the presence of CAP – 293A - T ( Fig . 5f ) , with the K dapp of DID – DAD estimated at 28 μ M and 5 . 4 μ M in the absence and presence of CAP – 293A - T , respectively ( see Methods for K dapp determination ) . These results suggest that the CAP – actin complex increases the affinity between DID and DAD . We used mass spectrometry to compare actin acetylation pat - terns for CAP – 293A - T and CAP – 293A - D samples . Four acetyla - tion sites on actin are appreciably enriched in CAP – 293A - T ( Lys 50 , Lys 68 , Lys 215 and Lys 315 ) , while three sites display no clear change in acetylation ( Lys 191 , Lys 326 and Lys 328 ; Supplementary Table 3 ) . These results suggest that the increase in CAP – actin inhibitory potency might be linked to acetylation of Lys 50 , Lys 68 , Lys 215 and / or Lys 315 . The ability of HDAC6 to abolish CAP – actin inhibition of INF2 suggests that HDAC6 might be required for cellular INF2 activa - tion . Previously , we and others have shown that cell stimulation with ionomycin ( IONO ) or histamine causes an INF2 - dependent cytosolic actin ‘burst’ 18 , 31 – 33 . Here , we show that TubA pretreat - ment strongly reduces the IONO - and histamine - induced actin burst in U2OS cells ( Fig . 5g , h ) , and the downstream consequence of increased mitochondrial calcium 18 ( Fig . 5i , j ) . These results show that HDAC6 can activate INF2 biochemically and in cells . We also tested whether IONO treatment alters KAc - actin lev - els in U2OS cells . Western blotting of acetyl - lysine ( Ac - K ) from cell lysates resulted in high background noise . We took an alter - native approach in which we expressed 2 × strep - tagged CAP2 , then affinity - purified the CAP2 and examined Ac - K levels of the bound actin at various time points after treatment . Mock treat - ment with DMSO results in measurable KAc - actin , and treat - ment with TubA strongly increases KAc - actin ( Fig . 5k ) . IONO treatment causes a significant drop in KAc - actin at 30 s , with a return to control levels at 2 min ( Fig . 5k ) . This time course cor - relates with that of the IONO - induced actin burst ( Fig . 5g ) . In addition , endogenous INF2 copurifies with CAP2 in DMSO - and TubA - treated samples , but copurification is greatly reduced at 30 s after IONO treatment ( Fig . 5k ) . These results suggest that IONO 2 min 3 min 4 min 5 min 6 min – – – CAP INF2 – FL INF2 – FL + CAP 160 120 100 140 80 60 40 20 0 160 100 120 80 60 40 20 0 N u m be r o f f il a m en t s F il a m en t l eng t h ( µ m ) 120 170 220 270 320 370 Time ( s ) Time ( s ) 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1 , 000 1 , 100 Actin and profilin Actin and profilin + CAP CAP INF2 - FL + CAP INF2 - FL + CAP + INF2 - FL INF2 - FL a b c 5 µ m Fig . 4 | CAP inhibits INF2 - mediated nucleation observed by TIRF microscopy . a , Time - lapse TIRF microscopy images showing actin polymerization ( 1 µ M actin monomer , 10 % TAMRA – actin ) containing 3 µ M profilin in the presence or absence of 1 nM INF2 - FL and 50 nM CAP2 – CSKA .

Disease - associated INF2 mutants display reduced inhibition by CAP – actin . Although multiple mutations in the INF2 DID are linked to FSGS and CMTD , the molecular mechanism of disease progression is unknown . We therefore investigated whether CAP – actin could inhibit two INF2 mutants : R218Q , a common FSGS mutant 22 , and L77R , a CMTD mutant 23 . Arg 218 is located near the DAD - binding site but is not predicted to make direct contact with DAD 22 , whereas Leu 77 is localized on the opposite face of the DID from the DAD - binding site . CAP – CSKA displays reduced inhibi - tion of both mutants biochemically , with R218Q being particu - larly resistant ( Fig . 6a , b ) , suggesting that disease - associated INF2 mutants are not efficiently regulated by CAP – KAc - actin . We also tested the regulation of INF2 - L77R and INF2 - R218Q in cells , by transfecting mutant nonCAAX constructs into INF2 - knockout ( KO ) U2OS cells . Fixed - cell analysis shows that both mutants display significantly higher cytosolic actin filaments than INF2 - WT ( Fig . 6c , d ) . Live - cell analysis shows that cytoplasmic actin filament levels are significantly higher for both mutants than for the INF2 - WT , and that IONO stimulation does not induce increased actin filaments in the mutants ( Fig . 6e ) . We also tested the interaction between INF2 mutants and CAP2 in cells , and found no apparent co - IP , in contrast to INF2 - WT ( Fig . 6f ) . Finally , we tested the effect of TubA treatment on cytoplasmic actin filament levels in L77R - INF2 - or R218Q - INF2 - expressing cells , and found no decrease in these levels , suggesting that increased lysine acetylation of actin does not inhibit these mutants efficiently ( Supplementary Fig . 5j , k ) . These results show that two disease - associated INF2 mutants are poorly regulated in cells . Discussion Here we reveal a cellular role for KAc - actin , inhibition of INF2 through a KAc - actin – CAP complex . We refer to the mechanism as facilitated autoinhibition because an additional molecule is required to mediate the autoinhibitory interaction of INF2 . Actin deacety - lation through HDAC6 relieves INF2 inhibition , whereas cellu - lar HDAC6 inhibition blocks stimulus - induced INF2 activation . Conversely , INF2 mutants linked to two human diseases , FSGS and CMTD , are poorly inhibited by CAP – KAc - actin and are constitu - tively active in cells . A variety of actin PTMs have previously been identified 34 . Actin acetylation research has mainly focused on the N terminus , where all actins are modified 35 . Lysine acetylation of actin has been identified 34 but its importance has been unclear . Our demonstration that KAc - actin inhibits INF2 adds to known acetylation events for other cyto - skeletal proteins . Two actin - binding proteins have been shown to be acetylated : cortactin 36 and the formin mDia2 37 . In both cases , acetyla - tion inhibits interaction with actin . Interestingly , formin proteins can influence tubulin acetylation through a variety of mechanisms 15 , 38 , 39 . The presence of CAP in the INF2 inhibitory complex is intrigu - ing . CAP was originally identified in budding yeast as an interacting protein for adenylyl cyclase 40 , 41 , but this interaction is not conserved in mammals . CAP binds both actin monomers and filaments 42 – 45 . Purified CAP stimulates actin filament disassembly in the pres - ence of cofilin or twinfilin , but CAP alone has little effect on actin disassembly 27 , 46 . The two mammalian CAPs , CAP1 and CAP2 , are approximately 60 % identical and are differentially expressed 47 , 48 . We show that both CAP1 and CAP2 inhibit INF2 , and that CAP – actin directly interacts with INF2 . CAP – actin is a high - molecular - mass complex , consistent with previous reports of CAP hexamerization 26 , 27 . Interestingly , addi - tional INF2 - inhibitory fractions from mouse brain tissue also contain CAP1 or CAP2 . Gel - filtration profiles of these fractions suggest that cellular CAP is heterogeneous , and might include some non - hexameric species . Alternatively , CAP might associate with additional proteins . CAP can interact with several actin - binding proteins , including cofilin , profilin , twinfilin and ABP1 ( refs . 27 , 46 , 49 ) . Our purified BIF fraction contains several coeluting proteins , including subunits of vacuolar ATPase and exportin . These proteins might confer other properties . Autoinhibition through the DID – DAD interaction is a major regulatory mechanism for most metazoan formins 3 – 5 . However , some formins that do not contain canonical DID or DAD are still subject to direct autoinhibition through N - and C - terminal interac - tions 50 . Other formins are regulated by protein binding in trans 51 – 57 . Our results demonstrate the facilitation of formin autoinhibition by another protein . The fact that a mutation known to disrupt the inter - action between DID and DAD results in constitutive INF2 activity ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) suggests that the interaction between DID and DAD is required . However , we cannot rule out the possibility that CAP – actin serves as a bridge between DID and DAD , with DAD binding to KAc - actin directly 11 , 24 . The fact that CAP can asso - ciate with INF2 suggests that CAP is part of the inhibitory complex and not merely delivering KAc - actin . Our schematic model of an inhibitory complex between CAP – actin and INF2 ( Fig . 6g ) does not distinguish between direct DID – DAD interaction or the CAP – actin bridge model , nor does it depict CAP hexamerization ; these are two issues to be addressed in future work . The acetylation positions identified on actin provide insight into the inhibitory mechanism of the CAP – KAc - actin complex . Four lysines display acetylation increases in the inhibitory CAP – actin complex : Lys 50 , Lys 68 , Lys 215 and Lys 315 . These residues are all on the surface of the actin monomer ( Supplementary Fig . 6a ) , although Lys 315 probably contributes to interactions between sub - domains . These residues do not make significant intersubunit con - tacts in the filament ( Supplementary Fig . 6b ) , so acetylation may not disrupt polymerization . One acetylation site , Lys 68 , might alter the binding affinity of CAP , as it is located at the binding interface in the dimeric structure of the CARP domain of CAP with actin 58 ( Supplementary Fig . 6c ) . Current structural models of the formin homology 2 domain bound to actin suggest that there is little inter - action between these residues and the FH2 ( Supplementary Fig . 6d ) . Several questions arise regarding cellular INF2 regulation through this mechanism . First , what percentage of actin must be acetylated ? We have previously determined total cytosolic actin to be approximately 200 μ M in U2OS cells 59 , consistent with values in other cell types 28 , whereas INF2 levels are likely to be less than 1 μ M . Therefore , acetylation of less than 1 % of cytosolic actin could suffice for INF2 inhibition . A second question concerns the cellular signal that triggers actin deacetylation and INF2 activation . It is clear that increased cytoplas - mic calcium activates INF2 ( refs . 18 , 31 – 33 ) , but the link to decreased actin acetylation is unclear . One possible link is through calcium - mediated metabolic changes 60 . Lysine acetylation is governed by the balance between lysine acetyltransferase ( KAT ) and deacetylase activities , and the appreciable cellular acetylation – deacetylation flux 30 could be due changes in either process . Several cytosolic members of the approximately 20 member mammalian KAT family could medi - ate actin acetylation 30 . An intriguing possibility is that fluctuating levels of the acetyl donor , acetyl - CoA , could regulate KAT activity 61 , perhaps relating to the role of INF2 in mitochondrial division 18 , 19 and the relationship between mitochondrial division and metabo - lism 62 . Alternatively , increased calcium might increase deacety - lase activity , with HDAC6 being a prime candidate . Interestingly , HDAC6 activity has been shown to cause an increase in cellular actin polymerization 36 , 63 . In addition , calmodulin might participate in cal - cium - mediated INF2 activation . An interaction between INF2 and calcium - bound calmodulin has been shown in cell lysates 33 . Our results have important implications for disease mechanisms of both FSGS and CMTD .

Human INF2 - FL - nonCAAX cDNA was produced from a human INF2 - CAAX clone ( Origene SC313010 , NM _ 022489 ) in which the CAAX exon was replaced with the nonCAAX exon , a 12 - base deletion in the purchased clone was corrected , and codon optimization was carried out . This construct was subsequently cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of a modified eGFP - C1 vector ( Clontech ) containing Strep - tag II ( IBA Life Sciences ) and an HRV3C cleavage site that was located N - terminal to the INF2 start codon . INF2 mutations ( A149D , L77R and R218Q ) were generated in the above - mentioned INF2 - FL - nonCAAX construct by site - directed mutagenesis . Human CAP1 and CAP2 cDNAs were purchased from NovoPro ( 710829 - 5 ( NM - 006367 ) and 710470 - 11 ( NM - 006366 ) ) , then the entire open reading frame was PCR - amplified and cloned into a modified eGFP - N1 vector ( Clonetech ) —containing an HRV3C cleavage site followed by the GFP open reading frame , followed by Strep - tag II—using XhoI and KpnI sites . The Flag - tagged human HDAC6 plasmid was purchased from Addgene ( 30482 ) . Mito - R - GECO1 ( K d = 0 . 48 µ M for calcium ) construct , as well as GFP – F - tractin and mApple – F - tractin constructs have been described previously 18 . Recombinant protein expression and purification . For protein expression in mammalian cells , 2 × 10 6 FreeStyle 293 - F cells ( Life Technologies , R790 - 07 ) growing in 1 l of FreeStyle 293 expression medium ( Life Technologies , 12338 - 018 ) were transfected with 0 . 5 mg of DNA and 1 . 5 mg of sterile 25 kDa linear polyethyleneimine mixed in Opti - MEM reduced - serum medium ( Life Technologies , 31985070 ) . Proteins were expressed at 37 °C , 8 % CO 2 with shaking at 125 r . p . m . for 2 d ( INF2 ) or 3 d ( CAP1 , CAP2 and HDAC6 ) . For the TubA treatment of CAP2 - transfected cells , cells were centrifuged at 300 g at 4 °C after 3 d of transfection , and resuspended in DMEM without serum . DMSO or 50 µ M TubA ( Selleckchem , S2627 ) were added and cells were cultured for an additional 1 h before collection . For strep - tagged protein purification from FreeStyle 293 cells , all of the following steps were performed either at 4 °C or on ice . Cells were pelleted at 300 g for 15 min , and the pellets were resuspended in 45 ml EB - S ( 100 mM HEPES buffer pH 7 . 4 , 500 mM NaCl 2 , 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 1 % v / v Triton X - 100 , 2 μ g ml − 1 leupeptin , 10 μ g ml − 1 aprotinin , 2 μ g ml − 1 pepstatin A , 1 μ g ml − 1 calpeptin , 1 μ g ml − 1 calpain inhibitor I , 1 mM bezamidine and 1 : 1 , 000 dilution of universal nuclease ( Thermo Fisher , 88702 ) ) per 5 ml cell pellet . followed by 30 min end - over - end mixing at 4 °C . For TubA - treated cells , EB - S also contained 500 nM tricostatin A ( Selleckchem , S1045 ) and 10 mM sodium butyrate ( Sigma - Aldrich , 303410 ) . The cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation at 185 , 000 g for 1 h ( Ti45 rotor , Beckman ) , and the supernatant was blocked with avidin ( 20 μ g ml − 1 ; Sigma - Aldrich , 189725 ) then applied to Strep - Tactin Superflow resin ( 2 - 1206 - 025 ; IBA ) equilibrated in EB - S . After a thorough wash with WB ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT ) , the column was either ( 1 ) treated with HRV3C protease in WB ( at 1 : 50 enzyme to substrate molar ratio ) for 16 h at 4 °C followed by a three - column volume WB wash to obtain untagged protein or ( 2 ) eluted with strep elution buffer ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT and 2 . 5 mM desthiobiotin ) to obtain the strep – GFP fusion protein . The protein was concentrated using a 30 , 000 MWCO Amicon Ultra - 15 filter unit ( Millipore ) before further purification through a Superdex 200 16 / 60 gel - filtration column ( GE Bioscience ) equilibrated with 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT . The protein was further concentrated to > 10 µ M before being aliquoted , frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C . In all cases , HEPES pH given is at 23 °C . For the purification of Flag - tagged protein from Freestyle 293 cells , cells were collected in the same way as described above , and lysed in EB - F ( 50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 1 % v / v Triton X - 100 , 2 μ g ml − 1 leupeptin , 10 μ g ml − 1 aprotinin , 2 μ g ml − 1 pepstatin A , 1 μ g ml − 1 calpeptin , 1 μ g ml − 1 calpain inhibitor I , 1 mM bezamidine and 1 : 1 , 000 dilution of universal nuclease ) . Cell lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation at 185 , 000 g for 1 h ( Ti45 ) , and the supernatant was loaded onto Anti - Flag M2 affinity gel ( Sigma - Aldrich , A2220 ) equilibrated with EB - F . The column was washed with WB - F ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT ) thoroughly , and Flag - tagged protein was eluted with Flag elution buffer ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT and 100 μ g ml − 1 Flag octapeptide ( Sigma - Aldrich , F3290 ) ) . The protein was gel filtered on Superdex 200 , concentrated and stored as described above . Actin preparation . Details of the actin preparation have been described previously 16 . RSKA ( fresh muscle ; Fox and Crow Farm ) or CSKA ( frozen chicken breast ; Trader Joe’s ) was purified from acetone powder . Rabbit muscle actin was labelled with pyrenyliodoacetamide , TAMRA NHS ester ( Molecular Probes , C1171 ) or Oregon488 NHS ester ( Thermo Fisher , O6185 ) . Both labelled and unlabelled actin were gel - filtered on Superdex 75 ( GE Biosciences ) and stored in G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris - HCl buffer pH 8 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 and 0 . 01 % w / v sodium azide ) at 4 °C . For mouse brain - tissue actin purification , all steps were conducted at 4 °C . Mouse brains ( 50 g ) were homogenized using a polytron ( Kinematica PT3100 ) in EB ( 50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 2 mM DTT , 2 μ g ml − 1 leupeptin , 10 μ g ml − 1 aprotinin , 2 μ g ml − 1 pepstatin A , 1 μ g ml − 1 calpeptin , 1 μ g ml − 1 calpain inhibitor I and 1 mM bezamidine ) . Cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation at 185 , 000 g ( Ti45 ) , and the supernatant was filtered through 0 . 45 μ m filters . The supernatant was supplemented with ATP ( 4 mM ) , MgCl 2 ( 4 mM ) and sodium phosphate ( NaPO 4 , pH 7 . 0 , 20 mM ) , and this was followed by end - over - end mixing at 4 °C for 16 h . Polymerized brain actin was pelleted by centrifugation for 3 h at 185 , 000 g , and the pellet was washed by resuspension - pelleting cycle sequentially with 2 × WB1 ( 500 mM KCl , 0 . 5 % v / v Thesit , 10 mM NaPO 4 pH 7 . 0 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT and 2 μ g ml − 1 leupeptin ) , and 2 × WB2 ( 50 mM KCl , 10 mM NaPO 4 pH 7 . 0 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT and 2 μ g ml − 1 leupeptin ) . The pellet was then washed with G - buffer with minimal disturbance and then resuspended in G - buffer before shearing through a 30G 1 / 2 needle . Sheared actin was dialysed in G - buffer for 16 h before ultracentrifugation at 185 , 000 g ( Ti70 . 1 rotor , Beckman ) , then the concentration was made up to > 10 μ M . Purification of BIF . Purification of BIF was conducted at 4 °C . Mouse brains ( 100 g ; Pel - Freez Biologicals ) were homogenized with a polytron in EB . Cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation at 185 , 000 g ( Ti45 rotor ) , and the supernatant was filtered through 0 . 45 μ m filters then supplemented with KCl to 100 mM before loading onto a 90 ml Q - Sepharose column ( GE Biosciences ) . The BIF - containing fraction was eluted with Q350 ( 350 mM KCl , 50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 2 μ g ml − 1 leupeptin , 10 μ g ml − 1 aprotinin , 2 μ g ml − 1 pepstatin A , 1 μ g ml − 1 calpeptin and 1 μ g ml − 1 calpain inhibitor I ) . The eluate was diluted threefold with EB before loading onto a 50 ml Source Q column ( GE Biosciences ) . Linear ionic strength gradient elution was performed using Q100 ( 100 mM KCl , 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT ) and Q350 ( Q100 + 250 mM KCl ) . Fractions were dialysed into 1 . 5 × KMEH + DTT ( 15 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 75 mM KCl , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 5 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT ) and tested for inhibition of INF2 - FL activity by pyrene – actin polymerization assay ( 20 nM INF2 , 2 μ M actin ( 5 % pyrene ) ) . Inhibitory peak fractions were pooled and passed over a Superdex 200 16 / 60 gel filtration column equilibrated in 1 . 5 × KMEH + DTT . Inhibitory peak fractions were pooled and purified through an 8 ml Source Q column ( GE Biosciences ) at pH 8 . 8 with a gradient ranging from 100 to 300 mM KCl ( in 10 mM Tris pH 8 . 8 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT ) . Fractions were dialysed into 1 . 5 × KMEH + DTT and assayed . Peak inhibitory fractions were pooled and dialysed into Q0 ( 10 mM HEPES pH 6 . 8 at 4 °C , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT ) before they were applied to a 1 ml SourceS column ( GE Biosciences ) with gradient elution from 0 to 100 mM KCl ( in 10 mM HEPES pH 6 . 8 at 4 °C , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT ) . Fractions were dialysed into 1 . 5 × KMEH + DTT , assayed for inhibitory activity , analysed by silver - stained SDS – PAGE and pooled . To determine the concentration of CAP in BIF , samples from Source S column fractions ( Fig . 1i ) were resolved—along with actin standards with known mass—by 7 . 5 % SDS – PAGE . Gels were stained using colloidal Coomassie stain ( Thermo Fisher ) , and the CAP concentration was analysed by densitometry ( ImageJ ) , using actin as a standard . For determination of IC 50 for CAP in BIF , a linear fit was applied to the activity of BIF in Fig . 2f , and the activity of actin was used as baseline . TIRF microscopy . Detailed methods for the TIRF microscopy have been described elsewhere 17 . In brief , glass flow chambers were assembled using micro cover glasses ( 22 × 22 and 18 × 18 mm , No . 1 . 5 ; VWR ) with double - stick adhesive tape to hold 10 μ l volume . Before assembly , cover glasses were washed in acetone ( 50 min ) , ethanol ( 10 min ) and MilliQ water ( 1 min ) , then incubated in 1 : 2 ratio of 30 % H 2 O 2 : H 2 SO 4 for 1 h . Cover glasses were then rinsed with water , followed by 0 . 1 M KOH , followed by water again and dried with inert gas before silanization overnight in 0 . 0025 % dichlorodimethyl silane ( Sigma - Aldrich , 85126 ) and chloroform . Subsequently , the cover glasses were washed with methanol , dried with inert gas and stored in clean , sealed containers . Chambers were incubated with 1 % w / v Pluronic F127 ( Sigma - Aldrich , P2443 ) in BRB80 ( 80 mM PIPES / KOH pH 6 . 9 , 1 mM EGTA and 1 mM MgCl 2 ) for 1 min and then equilibrated in TIRF buffer ( 10 mM imidazole pH 7 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 100 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 15 mM glucose , 0 . 5 % methylcellulose , 0 . 01 mg ml − 1 catalase ( Sigma - Aldrich , C3515 ) , 0 . 05 mg ml − 1 glucose oxidase ( Sigma - Aldrich , G6125 ) and 0 . 1 % BSA ) . Nucleation - elongation assays were conducted as previously described 16 . In brief , unlabelled RSKA monomers were mixed with 20 % TAMRA or Oregon - labelled actin monomers ( 2 μ M ) in G - buffer , diluted with profilin ( 3 μ M ) in 2 × TIRF buffer in the presence or absence of 1 nM untagged INF2 - FL and / or 100 nM CAP – CKSA , and introduced into the flow chamber . The filaments were visualized on a Nikon Eclipse Ti - E inverted microscope—with 488 - or 561 - nm lasers—that was driven by Nikon Elements software . Single - colour images were acquired every 5 s at 100 ms exposure using a TIRF objective ( × 60 / 1 . 49 NA ) and an electron - multiplying charge - coupled device camera ( Andor ) with an Andor TuCam adapter using Perfect Focus . Filament number and length were measured manually from frame to frame using Nikon NIS - Elements 4 . 40 . 00 . For display of TIRF images , original images were adjusted using Photoshop CS5 ( Adobe Inc . ) . Curve function was used to lock the intensity of the filaments and then reduce the background haze . All panels were adjusted as a single image . Pyrene – actin polymerization assay . RSKA in G - buffer ( 6 μ M actin , 5 % pyrene ) was converted to Mg 2 + salt by the addition of 1 mM EGTA and 0 . 1 mM NATuRe Cell BIology | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATure Cell BIology MgCl 2 ( from 10 × stock ) for 2 min at 23 °C immediately before polymerization . Polymerization was induced by the addition of 2 volumes of formin with or without other proteins ( INF2 and / or inhibitory fraction ) in 1 . 5 × polymerization buffer ( 75 mM KCl , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 5 mM EGTA , 15 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 2 mM DTT , 2 mM Tris - HCl , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 and 0 . 01 % w / v NaN 3 ) . Pyrene fluorescence ( 365 / 410 nm ) was monitored in a 96 - well fluorescence plate reader ( Infinite M1000 ; Tecan ) within 1 min of mixing actin and formin , or other proteins or fractions . The slope of the curve at half maximum is plotted to represent INF2 activity . Velocity analytical ultracentrifugation ( vAUC ) . We conducted vAUC using a Beckman Proteomelab XL - A and an AN - 60 rotor . Untagged INF2 - FL - nonCAAX ( 3 . 8 μ M ) , CAP2 – GFP ( 7 μ M ) or GFP – INF2 ( 1 . 8 μ M ) in K50MEHD ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT ) was centrifuged at 25 , 000 r . p . m . with monitoring at 280 nm ( untagged INF2 ) or at 490 nm ( GFP - tagged proteins ) . Data were analysed by Sedfit to determine the sedimentation coefficient , frictional ratio and apparent mass . The sedimentation coefficient reported is that of the major peak ( at least 80 % of the total analysed mass ) at OD 280 nm for untagged INF2 or CAP2 , or OD 490 nm for GFP – INF2 or CAP2 – GFP . Antibodies . Antibodies used in this study were anti - vacuolar ATPase subunit A ( rabbit anti - ATP6V1A , Abcam , ab199325 ) , anti - vacuolar ATPase subunit B2 ( rabbit anti - ATP6V1B2 , Abcam , ab73404 ) , anti - heat - shock cognate 71 kDa protein ( rat anti - Hsc70 , Abcam , ab51052 ) , anti - CAP2 ( goat polyclonal , Santa Cruz , sc - 167378 ) , anti - CAP1 ( rabbit polyclonal , Abcam , ab96354 ) , anti - GFP ( rabbit polyclonal , gift from W .

Anti - INF2 was described previously 27 ( 941 – 1249 antibody used , rabbit polyclonal ) . Details on antibodies are provided in Supplementary Table 5 . Immunodepletion . The initial SourceQ inhibitory fraction pool from mouse brain preparations ( fractions 38 – 40 , Supplementary Fig . 2a ) was incubated with antibodies against vacuolar ATPase subunit A , vacuolar ATPase subunit B2 , heat - shock cognate 71 kDa protein and CAP2 or with control IgG ( rabbit anti - GFP ) , at 4 °C . In brief , 10 μ l of each antibody was added into 500 μ l fractions , and this was followed by 16 h incubation with end - over - end mixing at 4 °C . The antigen – antibody complex was precipitated by protein A or protein G agarose beads ( GE Biosciences ) . The supernatant was recovered and tested for INF2 inhibition . Supernatants and pellets were probed for the depleted protein . CAP - bound actin exchange assay . CAP2 – GFP – 2 × strep protein purified from 293 cells ( also containing bound actin ) was immobilized on Strep - Tactin beads , then washed with G - buffer . The indicated species of actin ( in G - buffer ) was incubated with CAP2 – GFP Strep - Tactin beads at 4 °C with end - over - end mixing for 12 h . The concentrations of added actin and bead - bound CAP2 – GFP in exchange reactions were 5 μ M and 1 μ M , respectively . Beads were washed with 20 volumes of G - buffer . Exchanged CAP2 – GFP was removed from beads by either by eluting with G - buffer containing 2 . 5 mM dethiobiotin or by cleavage from beads by HRV3C protease ( 1 : 50 , overnight at 4 °C ) . Protein - binding assays . For the Strep - Tactin pull - down of purified proteins , 1 μ M Strep – GFP - tagged protein ( GFP , INF2 - FL or INF2 - FFC ) was incubated with 2 μ M untagged CAP ( with or without actin exchange ) in IPB ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM DTT and 1 % v / v Thesit ) with end - over - end mixing at 4 °C for 8 h . Separately , 0 . 2 volumes of 50 % Strep - Tactin Superflow bead slurry were blocked with 10 mg ml − 1 avidin and washed in 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , and 1 mM DTT before addition to the protein mix . After 8 h incubation at 4 °C , beads were washed with IPB ( now containing 0 . 2 % v / v Thesit ) . The bead pellet was probed by western blotting with anti - GFP , anti - CAP2 or anti - actin antibodies . For the Strep - Tactin pull - down from cell extracts , WT U2OS cells expressing CAP2 – GFP were treated with 50 μ M TubA for 1 h , DMSO for 15 min or 4 μ M IONO ( in serum - containing medium ) for the indicated length of time before lysis in prechilled PDEB ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM DTT , 3 % v / v Thesit , 2 μ g ml − 1 leupeptin , 10 μ g ml − 1 aprotinin , 2 μ g ml − 1 pepstatin A , 1 μ g ml − 1 calpeptin , 1 μ g ml − 1 calpain inhibitor I , 1 mM bezamidine , 500 nM tricostatin A and 10 mM sodium butyrate ) in the dish ( immediately after removal of medium ) and then incubated with shaking at 4 °C for 15 min . Lysate was centrifuged at 100 , 000 r . p . m . in a TLA120 rotor ( Beckman ) at 4 °C for 20 min , and the supernatant was blocked with avidin ( 20 μ g ml − 1 ; Sigma - Aldrich , 189725 ) then mixed with Strep - Tactin Superflow resin ( prewashed with PDEB ) with end - over - end mixing for 3 h at 4 °C . Beads were washed with PDEB twice and 1 × PBS buffer twice . The pellet was resolved by SDS – PAGE , and western blot probed with anti - actin , anti - acetyl - lysine or anti - INF2 antibodies . For the IP of purified proteins , 0 . 5 μ M Strep – GFP - tagged protein ( GFP – INF2 - FL or GFP – INF2 - FFC ) was incubated with 2 μ M untagged CAP ( with or without exchange ) in IPB for 3 h at 4 °C . Then , 50 μ g anti - GFP antibody was added and incubated for 12 h with end - over - end mixing at 4 °C . Protein A beads were blocked with 10 mg ml − 1 avidin and washed in IPB before incubating with protein mix for 3 h . Beads were washed with IPB ( now containing 0 . 2 % v / v Thesit ) . The bead pellet was resolved by SDS – PAGE , and the western blot was probed with anti - GFP , anti - CAP2 or anti - actin antibodies . For statistical analysis , results from three independent experiments were quantified . CAP2 band intensity was normalized against a GFP control using ImageJ . For immunoprecipitation from cell extracts , INF2 - KO U2OS cells expressing GFP , GFP – INF2 - FL - nonCAAX - WT , GFP – INF2FFC or GFP – INF2 - FL - nonCAAX - A149D , GFP – INF2 - FL - nonCAAX - L77R and GFP – INF2 - FL - nonCAAX - R218Q mutants were trypsinized and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min , and the cell pellet washed with PBS . The cell pellet was lysed with prechilled IPEB ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM DTT , 3 % v / v Thesit , 2 μ g ml − 1 leupeptin , 10 μ g ml − 1 aprotinin , 2 μ g ml − 1 pepstatin A , 1 μ g ml − 1 calpeptin , 1 μ g ml − 1 calpain inhibitor I and 1 mM bezamidine ) , then treated with latrunculin A ( Sigma - Aldrich , L5163 ) at 20 μ M for 15 min on ice . Cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation at 100 , 000 r . p . m . ( TLA - 100 rotor ) . The supernatant was incubated with 10 μ g anti - GFP with end - over - end mixing at 4 °C for 12 h . Protein A beads ( 20 μ l ) were pre - blocked with 10 mg ml − 1 avidin and washed in IPEB before incubating with lysate for 3 h . Beads were washed with IPW ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM DTT and 0 . 2 % v / v Thesit ) , and bound proteins were resolved by SDS – PAGE western blot and probed with anti - GFP and anti - CAP2 antibodies . Fluorescence polarization anisotropy measurements conducted using INF2 - Cterm ( amino acids 941 – 1249 of INF2 - CAAX , expressed in bacteria ) labelled with TMR , as previously described 24 . TMR - INF2 - Cterm ( 100 nM ) was mixed with CAP – 293A - T and / or INF2 - Nterm ( amino acids 1 – 420 , expressed in bacteria as described previously 24 ) in 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 and 1 mM DTT at 23 °C , and fluorescence anisotropy was measured using a Tecan M1000 plate reader . The concentration of CAP – 293A - T was held constant at 20 M in some assays . Binding curves were fitted using standard hyperbolic saturation fitting 67 . In the case of the INF2 - Cterm – INF2 - Nterm interaction in the absence of CAP – 293A - T , saturation was not obtained and had to be assumed on the basis of extrapolation of the curve , which adds uncertainty to the K dapp value of 28 μ M . For this reason , we state that CAP – 293A - T increases the affinity of INF2 - Nterm for INF2 - Cterm at least fivefold , which is a conservative estimate of this increase . Mass spectrometry . Samples were separated by SDS – PAGE and bands were excised , destained and digested with trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37 °C . Peptides were extracted using 5 % formic acid and 50 % acetonitrile , and dried . Peptides were analysed on a Fusion Orbitrap mass spectrometer ( Thermo Scientific ) that was equipped with an Easy - nLC 1000 ( Thermo Scientific ) . Raw data were searched using COMET in high - resolution mode 68 , trypsin enzyme specificity with up to three missed cleavages , and carbamidomethylcysteine as a fixed modification . Oxidized methionine and acetylated lysine were searched as variable modifications . Quantification of spectra obtained from liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry was performed using MassChroQ 69 . Peptides were corrected for on the basis of protein amount , ratios of CAP and TubA in DMSO were calculated on a per - charge - state and per - peptide basis , and averaged . Additional analyses were performed at the Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility , Harvard . Live - cell imaging . Wild - type human osteosarcoma U2OS cells ( American Type Culture Collection , HTB96 ) or INF2 - KO U2OS cells 18 were grown in DMEM ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % calf serum ( Atlanta Biologicals ) . Cells were tested every 6 months for mycoplasma contamination using the LookOut PCR detection kit ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Cells were seeded at 4 × 10 5 cells per well in a six - well dish approximately 16 h before transfection . Plasmid transfections were performed in OPTI - MEM medium ( Invitrogen ) with 2 μ l Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) and 500 ng GFP – F - tractin and / or mito - R - GECO1 , or GFP – INF2 - FL - nonCAAX , GFP – INF2 - FL - nonCAAX - L77R mutant or GFP – INF2 - FL - nonCAAX - R218Q mutant with mApple – F - tractin per well for 6 h , followed by trypsinization and replating onto glass bottom MatTek dishes ( P35G - 1 . 5 - 14 - C ) at ~ 2 × 10 5 cells per well . Cells were imaged live in DMEM ( GIBCO , 21063 - 029 ) that was supplemented with 10 % neonatal calf serum ( HyClone , SH30118 . 03 ) around 16 – 24 h after transfection . For histamine or IONO treatments , 100 µ M histamine ( Sigma - Aldrich , H7125 ; from 100 mM stock in DMSO ) , 4 µ M IONO ( Sigma - Aldrich , I0634 ; from 2 mM stock in DMSO ) or DMSO alone was added at 1 min after commencement of imaging , and imaging continued for 5 – 10 min . The medium was pre - equilibrated for temperature and CO 2 content before use . For TubA treatments , cells were pretreated with either 50 µ M TubA ( from 10 mM stock in DMSO ) or equal volume DMSO ( control ) for 60 min before addition of histamine or IONO . Note that TubA - containing medium was made immediately before its addition to the cells , and individually for each plate . Imaging was conducted on a Dragonfly 302 spinning disk confocal ( Andor Technology Inc . ) on a Nikon Ti - E base and equipped with an iXon Ultra 888 EMCCD camera and a Tokai Hit stage - top incubator . Lasers used were as follows : solid - state 405 smart NATuRe Cell BIology | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles NATure Cell BIology diode 100 mW , solid - state 488 OPSL smart laser 50 mW , solid - state 560 OPSL smart laser 50 mW and solid - state 637 OPSL smart laser 140 mW . The objective used was a × 100 / 1 . 4 NA CFI Plan Apo ( Nikon ) . Images were acquired using Fusion software ( Andor ) ; imaging was conducted in a medial region of the cell , approximately 2 μ m above the basal surface . Fixed cell imaging . Cells were transfected with GFP , GFP – INF2 - FL - nonCAAX , GFP – INF2 - FL - nonCAAX - A149D mutant , GFP – INF2 - FL - nonCAAX - L77R mutant or GFP – INF2 - FL - nonCAAX - R218Q mutant , and split onto MatTek dishes , in the same way as for live cells . Cells were then treated with DMSO or 50 μ M TubA for 1 h before fixation with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences Inc . ) in PBS for 20 min at 23 °C . After washing with PBS , the cells were permeabilized on ice with 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 15 min . Cells were then washed with PBS before blocking with 10 % calf serum in PBS for 1 h at 23 °C . Actin was stained with 100 nM TRITC – phalloidin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and DNA was stained with 0 . 1 mg L − 1 w / v 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ; Calbiochem , 268298 ) for 10 min at 23 °C in the dark followed by a PBS wash . Cells were imaged in PBS using the Andor Dragonfly microscope and Zyla 4 . 2 Mpixel sCMOS camera . z - stacks with 0 . 2 μ m step size were acquired . Images from middle three z planes were used for quantification . Cells were selected on the basis of GFP expression and were then imaged for both GFP and phalloidin staining without first examining the degree of phalloidin staining . Measurements of actin intensity in fixed cells , and calcium changes and actin burst in live cells . TRITC – phalloidin intensity of two regions of interest ( ROIs ) in the perinuclear region was taken per cell , and was normalized to the intensity of two ROIs taken from a nuclear region ( which lack measurable phalloidin staining ) . Measurements of mitochondrial calcium and actin burst in live cells were conducted as described previously 18 . Mean fluorescence was calculated for each cell using ImageJ ( NIH ) . Fluorescence values for each time point after drug treatment ( F ) were normalized to the average initial fluorescence ( first five or six frames before stimulation ( F 0 ) ) and plotted against time as F / F 0 . For calcium measurements , all cells in the imaging field were analysed . Where cells were closely juxtaposed , calcium changes were analysed in the same ROI . For actin burst measurements , mean fluorescence values for each time point were calculated from four cells per ROI that were selected in the perinuclear region using ImageJ . Only cells fully in the imaging field were analysed . Cells were excluded from analysis for the following reasons : they were rounded up , or a substantial concentration of basal stress fibre signal in the field contributed to an abnormally high initial signal . Excluded cell percentages were as follows , in Fig . 5g : 15 % , 16 % and 19 % for DMSO , + IONO and + TubA + IONO , respectively ; and in Fig . 5h : 32 % for DMSO and histamine , and TubA and histamine . Statistical analysis and reproducibility . Errors ( s . e . m . ) were calculated using Excel ( Microsoft , v . 16 . 16 . 1 ) . Comparisons by one - sided Student’s t - test ( paired ) were conducted using GraphPad . Most experiments were reproduced three or more times ( as described in the figure legends ) with similar results . One exception was the BIF - purification procedure that was performed in full only once . All purification steps , however , were optimized in small - scale pilot experiments , typically two or three for each chromatographic column . Purified brain actin was tested for INF2 inhibition only once . Reporting Summary .

Sample size No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size . Data exclusions For pyrene - actin polymerization assays , curves were excluded if they contained sudden increases or decreases in fluorescence signal due to electronic fluctuations ( ie . substantial signal changes occurring from one time point to another ) . For live - cell microscopy data , cells were excluded from analysis if they were not fully in the imaging field , if they rounded up significantly during the time course , or if ( for actin ) significant stress fibers were present in the confocal section . For fixed cell analysis , all imaged cells were analyzed . These exclusion criteria were pre - established . Replication The cellular data were replicated on multiple independent coverslips , with individual transfections ( where transfections were used ) . Biochemical data were repeated through optimization ( BIF purification ) , multiple replicates in individual experiments , or separate experiments conducted on separate days . All attempts at replication were successful , with the exception of the tubastatin A cellular treatments . These were initially inconsistent , but the reason for the inconsistency was determined to be the length of time the tubastatin A was in the cell culture medium prior to adding to the cells . Once we determined the reason for the inconsistency , we adopted the procedure of adding tubastatin A to the culture medium immediately prior to addition to the cells ( within 2 min ) , which made the effects of tubastatin A reproducible . Randomization Data were not randomized prior to analysis . For fixed cell imaging and analysis of TRITC - phalloidin staining , cells were selected based on GFP expression , then images were collected for both GFP and TRITC without first examining quality of TRITC signal . All imaged cells were subsequently analyzed . For live - cell analysis , cells were selected that were well spread and contained the fluorescent proteins to be analyzed ( mitochondrial calcium or cytoplasmic Ftractin ) , then movies acquired during treatment with the indicated compounds . Some cells were excluded from subsequent analysis based on the criteria outlined above . Blinding The investigator was not blinded prior to analysis , except for the cellular assays in Figure S5k . Blinding is not common practice for the biochemical studies conducted .
