Rocha , 3 Disi An , 4 Ramya Raviram , 3 Jane A . Skok , 3 Esteban O . Mazzoni , 4 * Danny Reinberg 1 , 2 * Polycomb and Trithorax group proteins encode the epigenetic memory of cellular positional identity by establishing inheritable domains of repressive and active chromatin within the Hox clusters . Here we demonstrate that the CCCTC - binding factor ( CTCF ) functions to insulate these adjacent yet antagonistic chromatin domains during embryonic stem cell differentiation into cervical motor neurons . Deletion of CTCF binding sites within the Hox clusters results in the expansion of active chromatin into the repressive domain . CTCF functions as an insulator by organizing Hox clusters into spatially disjoint domains . Ablation of CTCF binding disrupts topological boundaries such that caudal Hox genes leave the repressed domain and become subject to transcriptional activation . Hence , CTCF is required to insulate facultative heterochromatin from impinging euchromatin to produce discrete positional identities . P recise expression of Hox genes is required for cells to maintain their relative position withinadevelopingembryo ( 1 – 4 ) . Forexam - ple , motor neurons ( MNs ) rely on Hox gene expression for the formation of position - dependent neural circuits that control voluntary movement ( 5 – 7 ) . High concentration of retinoic acid ( RA ) signaling induces rostral Hox gene expression ( Hox1 to Hox5 ) and , thus , cervical identity to differentiating MNs ( 8 ) . The in vivo development of MNs with a cervical positional identity can be faithfully recapitulated in vitro by exposing differentiating embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) to RA and a sonic hedgehog signaling agonist [ smoothened agonist ( SAG ) ] ( fig . S1A ) ( see supplementary materials and methods ) ( 9 ) . ESC - derived MNs exposed to RA activate the rostral portion of the HoxA cluster ( Hoxa1 - 6 ) , whereas Hoxa7 - 13 remain repressed ( Fig . 1A and table S1 ) ( 10 , 11 ) . The transcriptional partitioning of the HoxA cluster is mirrored at the level of chromatin . As previously described , H3K27me3 — the catalytic product of Polycomb repressive complex 2 activity — decorates the entire HoxA cluster in ESCs ( 11 ) ( Fig . 1B , top ) . Upon differen - tiation into MNs , H3K4me3 and RNA polymer - ase II ( RNAPII ) access the rostral segment of the cluster , whereas H3K27me3 becomes restricted to the caudal segment ( 11 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . Within the HoxA cluster , MNs display two clear disconti - nuities in H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 density : at the intergenic region between Hoxa5 and Hoxa6 ( C5 | 6 ) and between Hoxa6 and Hoxa7 ( C6 | 7 ) ( Fig . 1C ) . The DNA sequence underlying each of these discontinuities contains a highly con - served binding site for the CCCTC - binding factor ( CTCF ) ( 12 ) ( Fig . 1C and fig . S1 , B and C ) that is constitutively occupied in both ESCs and differentiated MNs ( Fig . 1B ) . CTCF - demarcated chromatin boundaries were observed at the HoxC and HoxD clusters as well ( Fig . 1C and fig . S2 ) and have recently been identified in the orthologous bithorax complex in Drosophila melanogaster ( 13 ) . It hasbeensuggestedthatCTCF functions asa chromatin barrier insulator by restricting the spread of heterochromatin , though this remains in dispute ( 14 – 16 ) . Therefore , we tested whether CTCF can perform Hox gene barrier insulation during differentiation to produce functional MN circuits . We employed the clustered regularly in - terspaced short palindromic repeat ( CRISPR ) genome - editing tool ( 17 , 18 ) in ESCs to disrupt CTCF binding sites that localize to chromatin boundaries within Hox clusters . We first gen - erated a 9 – base pair ( bp ) homozygous deletion within the core CTCF motif between Hoxa5 and Hoxa6 ( D 5 | 6 ) ( Fig . 1D ) and did not detect any mutations at potential off - target cleavage sites ( table S2 ) . The 9 - bp deletion results in a total abrogation of CTCF occupancy ( Fig . 1E ) . The neighboring CTCF binding site ( C6 | 7 ) also shows a dramatic reduction in binding , suggesting an interdependence ( Fig . 1E ) ( 19 , 20 ) . D 5 | 6 ESCs ex - hibitnodefectintheirabilitytodifferentiateintoMNs ( fig . S3 ) . To examine the transcriptional consequenceofdeletingCTCFbindingsiteswith - in the HoxA cluster in response to patterning sig - nals during cell differentiation , we performed RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) on wild - type ( WT ) and D 5 | 6 cells at two stages : ESCs and differ - entiated MNs . In ESCs , all HoxA genes are re - pressed in both lines ( Fig . 2A , left , and table S1 ) . Upon differentiation , Hoxa1 - 6 are activated in the WT setting , whereas Hoxa7 - 13 remain re - pressed , mirroring the distributionofactiveand repressivechromatin acrossthecluster . Hoxa1 - 6 are equivalently activated in WT and D 5 | 6 MNs . However , Hoxa7 — the gene located immediately caudal to the affected C6 | 7 site — is up - regulated more than 25 - fold relative to the WT control . Hoxa9 shows very modest expression in D 5 | 6 MNs , whereas Hoxa10 - 13 remain fully repressed ( Fig . 2A , right , and table S1 ) .

M . ) RESEARCH | REPORTS Hoxa6 — the gene located between the deleted C5 | 6 and C6 | 7 site — is equivalently expressed in terminally differentiated WT and D 5 | 6 MNs , it is transcriptionally activated earlier in differentiat - ing D 5 | 6 cells than in WT cells , unlike the rostral Hoxa5 control ( fig . S4 ) . Thus , CTCF occupancy regulatesthespatialandtemporalactivationofthe HoxA cluster . Demonstrating that CTCF boundary activity is not restricted to a single Hox cluster , deletion of a 13 - bp sequence within a binding site at the HoxC chromatin boundary results in the equivalenttranscriptional activation of genes located caudal to the site of mutation ( fig . S5 ) . Hoxa7 - specific transcriptional activation in D 5 | 6 MNs suggests that the intact C7 | 9 peak serves as anew boundary . To study if there is arelocation of the chromatin boundary during MN differen - tiation in the mutant line , we investigated the chromatin state of ESCs and differentiated MNs . Site - specific ablation of CTCF does not affect the chromatin state of undifferentiated cells , as WT and D 5 | 6 ESCs possess H3K27me3 distributed across the entire HoxA cluster ( Fig . 2B , top ) . How - ever , after differentiation , D 5 | 6 MNs exhibit a 50 % reduction in H3K27me3 levels , specifically within the region delimited by C5 | 6 and C7 | 9 ( Fig . 2B and fig . S6 , A and C ) . Inagreement withC7 | 9serving as the new boundary element in D 5 | 6 MNs , H3K27me3 density recovers to WT levels imme - diately caudal to the C7 | 9 peak . Moreover , deletion of C5 | 6 results in a complementary expansion of H3K4me3 and RNAPII up to the C7 | 9 boundary ( Fig . 2B and fig . S6 , B and D ) . The D 5 | 6 mutation does not produce pleiotropic effects , as chroma - tin boundaries are not disrupted in trans with - in the HoxC and HoxD clusters ( fig . S6 , C to E ) . Likewise , ablation of the C5 | 6 CTCF binding event within the HoxC cluster ( D 5 | 6 HoxC ) results in anequivalentchromatin boundaryrelocation ( fig . S5 ) . Thus , CTCF does not function within the Hox clusters according to the traditional definition of a chromatin insulator — to restrict the spread of repressive chromatin into adjacent euchromatin — but rather serves to restrict in cis the exposure of Polycomb repressed genes to Trithorax activity . CTCF - dependent insulation occurs via its ability to mediate looping interactions between nonadjacent segments of DNA ( 21 ) . Accordingly , CTCF is enriched at boundaries between topo - logically associated domains ( TADs ) ( 15 , 22 , 23 ) . To test how CTCF - mediated looping may regu - late the dynamic spatial reorganization of the HoxA clusterduringdifferentiation , weperformed 1018 27 FEBRUARY 2015 (cid:127) VOL 347 ISSUE 6225 sciencemag . org SCIENCE A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 A 5 A 6 A 7 A 9 A 10 A 11 A 13 Log2 Fold Change MN / ESC HoxA relative expression in WT ESCs vs MNs HoxA M o t o r N eu r on WT ∆ 5 | 6 CTCF Motif A5 A6 A7 A9 A10 A11 A13 10kb C5 | 6 C6 | 7 C7 | 9 C10 | 11 [ 0 , 50 ] [ 0 , 50 ] A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A9 A10 A11 A13 10kb ES C M o t o r N eu r on H3K27me3 H3K27me3 EZH2 H2AK119Ub H3K4me3 Pol II CTCF [ 0 , 7 . 5 ] [ 0 , 100 ] [ 0 , 100 ] [ 0 , 10 ] [ 0 , 100 ] [ 0 , 15 ] [ 0 , 50 ] C5 | 6 C6 | 7 C7 | 9 C10 | 11 WT ∆ 5 | 6 − 2 0 2 4 6 Rostral Caudal 5kb 2kb A5 A6 A7 C5 C6 HoxA HoxC CTCF H3K4me3 H3K27me3 PAM guide RNA Fig . 1 .

In WT and D 5 | 6 ESCs , the strong interaction signal of both 4C - seq viewpoints extends to the perimeter of the HoxA cluster , suggesting an organization of the locus as a single architectural domain that the C5 | 6 binding site does not alter ( Fig . 3A and fig . S7 , A and B ) . As expected , in WT cells this domain partitions during differentiation into two at roughly the C6 | 7 position , mirroring the dis - tribution of H3K4me3 in the rostral domain and H3K27me3 in the caudal domain ( 24 , 25 ) .

A magnified view of the boxed region is presented on the right . RESEARCH | REPORTS that results in an aberrant chromatin boundary and altered gene expression . These data argue that in response to RA signaling , the most rostral CTCF binding event forges a topological boundary within the HoxA cluster that can insulate active from repressive chromatin and thus maintain proper gene ex - pression . This model predicts that eliminating the C7 | 9 CTCF binding site in D 5 | 6 MNs would causeaberrantactivationof Hoxa7 - 10 andcaudal regression of the topological boundary to the C10 | 11 position . Using the CRISPR genome - editing tool in D 5 | 6 ESCs , we mutated the C7 | 9 CTCF bind - ing site . D 5 | 6 : 7 | 9 ESCs harbor a 21 - bp deletion spanning the C7 | 9 motif on one allele . The other allelecontainsa20 - bpinsertion thatdisruptsthe motif ( fig . S9 ) . Hoxa7 - 10 are highly up - regulated in the double - mutant MNs relative to the WT control ( Fig . 4 , A and B , fig . S4 , and table S1 ) . Hoxa9 - 10 are the most up - regulated genes in the polyA - selected transcriptome , whereas Hoxa11 - 13 remain transcriptionally silent . This phenotype is specific to CTCF ablation , as deletion of a YY1 binding motif adjacent to the C7 | 9 site does not result in the transcriptional activation of caudal genes ( fig . S10 ) ( 26 ) . The transcriptional profile of D 5 | 6 : 7 | 9 MNs suggests an underlying caudal boundary shift . Accordingly , 4C - seq using the active 4C . Hoxa5 - B viewpoint shows a shift of the topological boundary from C6 | 7 to the in - tact C10 | 11 position in D 5 | 6 : 7 | 9 MNs ( Fig . 4C and fig . S8C ) , allowing for a parallel expansion of H3K4me3 onto the Hoxa10 gene ( Fig . 4D ) . Con - versely , H3K27me3 density progressively de - creases relative to the WT control in a rostral direction from the C10 | 11 CTCF site . These results indicate that in response to patterning signals during differentiation , CTCF partitions the Hox clusters into insulated archi - tectural domains , upon which Trithorax and Polycomb activities are superimposed in a mutu - ally exclusive fashion to establish discrete Hox transcriptional programs . In agreement with our findings , deletion of a CTCF binding site at the boundary of a Polycomb domain containing the Tcfap2e locus resulted in its transcriptional acti - vation ( 27 ) . Whether the expansion of H3K4me3 activity that we observe in the Hox clusters is the result of aberrant enhancer contacts with cau - dal genes or an alternative local mechanism of Trithorax expansion remains to be tested . Our 4C - seq results agree with previous studies , which have shown that the caudal and rostral domains of the HoxA cluster in differentiated cells are incorporated into separate adjacent TADs , the borders of which align with the chromatin boundary . Our findings thus imply that CTCF is functionallyrequiredto delimitTADboundaries , though a high - resolution all - versus - all ( Hi - C ) ap - proach will be required to confirm this claim .
