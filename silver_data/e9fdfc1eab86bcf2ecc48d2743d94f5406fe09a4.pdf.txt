Here , we present the atomic structure of the Ca 2 + - sensing region of STIM1 consisting of the EF - hand and sterile a motif ( SAM ) domains ( EF - SAM ) . The canonical EF - hand is paired with a previously unidentiﬁed EF - hand . To - gether , the EF - hand pair mediates mutually indis - pensable hydrophobic interactions between the EF - hand and SAM domains . Structurally critical mu - tations in the canonical EF - hand , ‘‘hidden’’ EF - hand , or SAM domain disrupt Ca 2 + sensitivity in olig - omerization via destabilization of the entire EF - SAM entity . In mammalian cells , EF - SAM destabilization mutations within full - length STIM1 induce punctae formation and activate SOCE independent of luminal Ca 2 + . We provide atomic resolution insight into the molecular basis for STIM1 - mediated SOCE initiation and show that the folded / unfolded state of the Ca 2 + - sensing region of STIM is crucial to SOCE regulation . INTRODUCTION Spatiotemporal cytoplasmic Ca 2 + oscillations differentially regu - late myriad processes including apoptosis , contraction , exocy - tosis , fertilization , immunity , proliferation , and transcription ( Berridge et al . , 2003 ) . The link between inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - triphos - phate - mediated depletion of endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) luminal Ca 2 + and the activation of Ca 2 + - permeable , store - operated Ca 2 + ( SOC ) channels on the plasma membrane ( PM ) is termed store - operated Ca 2 + entry ( SOCE ) and is a major Ca 2 + entry pathway in electrochemically nonexcitable cells , providing a sustained cyto - plasmic Ca 2 + inﬂux from the extracellular space ( Putney , 1986 ) . SOCE is evolutionarily conserved from roundworm s to mam - mals , implying a fundamental disposition of this process to eu - karyotes . In T cells and other lymphocytes , SOCE through Ca 2 + release - activated Ca 2 + ( CRAC ) channels provides the prin - cipal source of cytoplasmic Ca 2 + that signals cytokine secretion and proliferation crucial to the immune response ( Feske , 2007 ) . Genetically impaired CRAC channels in severe combined immu - nodeﬁciency disease ( SCID ) patients lead to dysfunctional T and B cell activation and proliferation ( Feske et al . , 2006 ) . STIM1 is a single - pass , type - I transmembrane protein of 685 amino acids and is the ER - resident protein established as the SOCE activator in response to depletion of luminal Ca 2 + ( Liou et al . , 2005 ; Roos et al . , 2005 ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ) . The luminal N - terminal region of STIM1 includes an ER signal peptide , an EF - hand domain , and a SAM domain , whereas the cytosolic por - tion consists of two coiled - coil domains , a Pro / Ser - rich region , and a Lys - rich region ( Figure 1A ) ( Manji et al . , 2000 ; Williams et al . , 2001 , 2002 ) . Luminal Ca 2 + depletion results in redistribu - tion of STIM1 from ER homogeneity to punctae in close apposi - tion to the PM ; punctae formation precedes SOC inﬂux , implying a causal role for STIM1 aggregation in SOCE activation ( Liou et al . , 2005 ; Luik et al . , 2006 ; Wu et al . , 2006 ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ) . The EF - hand and SAM domains ( EF - SAM ) are vital to SOCE regulation , as Ca 2 + - binding mutants form punctae and ac - tivate SOCE independent of Ca 2 + ( Liou et al . , 2005 ; Mercer et al . , 2006 ; Soboloff et al . , 2006b ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ) and SAM dele - tion mutants lack the ability to form inducible punctae ( Baba et al . , 2006 ) . Recombinant EF - SAM alone is capable of oligomer - ization via Ca 2 + - depletion - induced structural changes , coupling N - terminal Ca 2 + sensing with SOCE initiation ( Stathopulos et al . , 2006 ) . The cytosolic C - terminal portion is essential for the redis - tribution of STIM1 oligomers to ER - PM junctions and subse - quent SOC channel opening ( Baba et al . , 2006 ; Huang et al . , 2006 ; Liou et al . , 2007 ) . STIM2 is a mammalian homolog that deviates from STIM1 in sequence similarity proximal to the coiled - coil domains toward the C terminus ( Soboloff et al . , 2006a ; Williams et al . , 2001 ) . Pedigree analysis of inheritable SCID and interfering ribonu - cleic acid ( RNA ) experiments identiﬁed Orai1 as another major SOC / CRAC channel regulator ( Feske et al . , 2006 ; Vig et al . , 2006b ; Zhang et al . , 2006 ) , later conﬁrmed as a subunit of the PM pore ( Prakriya et al . , 2006 ; Vig et al . , 2006a ; Yeromin et al . , 2006 ) . Coexpression of STIM1 and Orai1 results in substantial potentiation of SOCE in cultured cells ( Mercer et al . , 2006 ; Pei - nelt et al . , 2006 ; Soboloff et al . , 2006b ) . This dramatic synergism suggests that STIM1 and Orai1 constitute the principal molecular machinery involved in SOCE ; the former component serves as the ER Ca 2 + sensor and activator of SOC / CRAC channels , and the latter serves as the Ca 2 + - selective channel on the PM . 110 Cell 135 , 110 – 122 , October 3 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . Despite progress in identifying the SOCE machinery , structural understanding of this process at the atomic level was lacking . Here , we employed NMR spectroscopy and other structural and functional approaches to elucidate the basis for STIM1 Ca 2 + sensing in the ER with respect to SOCE . RESULTS NMR Structure of the Ca 2 + - Loaded EF - SAM Domain Several N - terminal STIM1 constructs were engineered ( resi - dues 1 – 201 , 23 – 213 , 58 – 201 , 58 – 128 , 110 – 201 , 115 – 201 , and Figure 1 . STIM1 Contains a ‘‘Hidden’’ EF - hand ( A ) Domain architecture of human STIM1 . Sequence analysis identiﬁes a single canonical EF - hand ( cEF1 ; violet ) ; however , the 3D structure reveals a second , ‘‘hidden’’ EF - hand ( hEF2 ; beige ) and a short linker helix ( gray ) between hEF2 and the sterile a motif domain ( SAM ; green ) .

Since STIM1 N - terminal se - quence alignments indicate that the EF - hand and SAM domains are the only conserved domains from worms to ﬂies to humans ( Strange et al . , 2007 ) and 58 – 201 demonstrated the highest frac - tion of secondary structure on a per residue basis ( far - UV circular dichroism [ CD ] ) , we pursued structural studies using this mini - mally bounded construct representative of all STIM proteins . Recombinant human STIM1 EF - SAM ( Ser58 to Gly201 ) exhibits a well - dispersed 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectrum in the presence of Ca 2 + ( Figure S1A , see Supplemental Data available online ) . Con - sequently , we implemented conventional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy ( Kanelis et al . , 2001 ) to determine the three - dimensional ( 3D ) structure of this luminal region of STIM1 . The 20 lowest - energy structures presented in the stereo ensemble have a post - water reﬁnement backbone root - mean - square deviation ( rmsd ) of 0 . 49 ± 0 . 07 A ˚ ( Figure 1B ) . The structural sta - tistics for the ensemble are given in Table S1 . At the structural level , the EF - hand and SAM domains are organized into a single , predominantly a - helical , cooperative and compact globular fold ( Figure 1C ) . The canonical Ca 2 + - binding EF - hand ( cEF1 ) forms a conven - tional helix - loop - helix EF motif ( a 1 b 1 a 2 ) ( Kretsinger and Nock - olds , 1973 ) . This EF - hand motif was previously thought to be the stand - alone functional unit responsible for Ca 2 + binding in STIM proteins ( Baba et al . , 2006 ; Cai , 2007 ; Liou et al . , 2005 ; Mercer et al . , 2006 ; Roos et al . , 2005 ; Soboloff et al . , 2006b ; Wil - liams et al . , 2001 ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ) . However , our structure shows that EF - SAM contains a second EF - hand ( a 3 b 2 a 4 ) . This ‘‘hidden’’ EF - hand ( hEF2 ) stabilizes the canonical EF - hand through hydrogen bonding between respective loop regions of each motif ( C ( O ) Val83 , Ile115 : N ( H ) Val83 , Ile115 ) , forming a small antiparallel b sheet ( Figure S1B ) as identiﬁed in other ca - nonical EF - hand pairs ( Ikura et al . , 1985 ) . A short helix ( a 5 ) links the EF - hand domain with the SAM domain that folds into the well - characterized 5 - helix bundle ( Stapleton et al . , 1999 ; Thanos et al . , 1999 ) consisting of helices a 6 – a 10 ( Figure 1C ) . The se - quence similarity between STIM1 and STIM2 ( 58 % identity and 88 % similarity for EF - SAM ) predicts a similar structure for STIM2 EF - SAM . A structural comparison using Dali found no EF - hand and SAM domain associations in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) . The STIM1 EF - hand pair best matches the C - terminal domain of bo - vine Ca 2 + - calmodulin ( C - CaM ) ( Dali Z = 2 . 1 , rmsd = 3 . 2 A˚ ) ( Figure S2A ) . Vector - geometry mapping of C - CaM and the EF - hand domain of STIM1 shows that each EF - hand motif is in the ‘‘open’’ conformation ( interhelical angles of 80 . 0 (cid:2) versus 81 . 4 (cid:2) for EF - hand 1 ; 96 . 7 (cid:2) versus 107 . 7 (cid:2) for EF - hand 2 , respec - tively ) ( Figure S2B ; Table S2 ) . The paired EF - hands in EF - SAM intimately interact with the SAM domain ; the hydrophobic sur - face of the ‘‘open’’ EF - hands is buried against nonpolar SAM contacts ( see below ) . The STIM1 SAM domain most resembles SAM of the EphB2 receptor ( Dali Z = 4 . 0 , rmsd = 2 . 1 A ˚ ) ( Figure S2C ) . A structure - based sequence alignment of several SAM domains with STIM1 demonstrates the conservation of pri - marily hydrophobic residues within each helix ( Figure S3 ) . Addi - tionally , the acidic residues in a 7 and the basic residues in a 10 of STIM1 are conserved through all SAM structures aligned . The present EF - SAM structure exhibits a rare example of an extracel - lular SAM domain , as a small fraction of STIM1 exists on the PM ( Kim and Bowie , 2003 ; Manji et al . , 2000 ) . The electrostatic surface of EF - SAM is primarily negative at neutral pH ( Figure 1D ) . Two prominent acidic clusters are appar - ent from the surface charges . Several residues from cEF1 and hEF2 form a highly concentrated negative patch proximate to the Ca 2 + - liganding site ( cEF1 : Asp77 , Asp78 , Asp82 , Asp84 , Glu86 , Glu87 , Asp89 , Glu90 , Glu94 , Asp95 ; hEF2 : Glu111 , Asp112 , Glu118 ) . The second negative region is formed on the opposite side of the protein with anionic charge contributions from hEF2 and the SAM domain ( hEF2 : Glu128 ; SAM : Asp135 , Glu136 , Asp196 ) . It is noteworthy that whereas the EF - hand do - main is chieﬂy acidic , the largest positive cluster of amino acids ( a 10 : Lys180 , Arg184 , Arg187 , Lys189 , Lys193 ) is located on the SAM domain . The precise signiﬁcance of these charged sur - faces is unknown ; however , they may afford binding sites for other ER proteins , nucleic acids , or membrane lipids . EF - Hand and SAM Domain Interactions The EF and SAM domains of STIM1 fold cooperatively , and fold - ing is well approximated by two - state thermodynamics ( Statho - pulos et al . , 2006 ) . Recombinant expression of cEF1 and hEF2 results in a constitutively ( ± Ca 2 + ) unfolded protein , as evidenced by far - UV CD ( data not shown ) . Expression of SAM alone yields little or no protein . The separate instability of the EF - hand and SAM domains is consistent with the two - state folding equilibrium of the EF - SAM entity , in which the domains do not fold discretely , but are dependent on each other for concerted folding . This mu - tual folding cooperativity is not surprising , as the structure re - veals robust contacts between these domains . The interaction between the EF and SAM domains is chieﬂy hydrophobic in nature . At least 11 amino acids from cEF1 and hEF2 form a well - deﬁned hydrophobic cleft ( Figure 2A ) . Leu195 and Leu199 on helix a 10 , proximal to the C terminus of SAM , provide prom - inent anchor residues for thecleft , restraining EF - SAM as asingle structural entity ( Figures 2B , 2C , and S1B ) . The minimal variation in both the cleft and the anchor nonpolar side chains within the 20 - structure ensemble attest to the compact core formed by these residues ( Figure 2D ) . The orientation of the anchoring residues in a 10 ( Leu195 and Leu199 ) of the SAM domain with re - spect to cEF1 and hEF2 ( Figure 2C ) is akin to the anchoring pep - tide residues of smMLCK ( Leu813 ) and other kinases with re - spect to CaM EF helices ( Figure S2D ) ( Chin and Means , 2000 ; Ikura et al . , 1992 ; Meador et al . , 1993 ) . A minor distinction is the rotation ( (cid:3) 30 (cid:2) ) of the STIM1 EF - hand domain about the anchoring residue protrusion compared to Ca 2 + - CaM : kinase peptide complexes . Internal association of the STIM1 EF - hand hydrophobic cleft with the SAM domain through a CaM - target recognition - like interaction precludes nonspeciﬁc associations via this sticky cleft and curtails destabilizing solvent exposure of hydrophobic residues in both domains . Mutational Analysis of EF - SAM Oligomerization Function Since STIM1 oligomerization is the molecular trigger for SOCE activation in response to diminished luminal Ca 2 + ( Liou et al . , 2007 ) , it is important to dissect out speciﬁc interactions critical for the initiation of this process . Mutations were engineered in 112 Cell 135 , 110 – 122 , October 3 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . each motif to elucidate potential modes of EF - SAM interaction ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . The quaternary structure of EF - SAM was assessed by using size - exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) and multiangle light scattering ( MALS ) . Wild - type EF - SAM exists as a monomer ( mass = 17 . 4 kDa ) in the presence of Ca 2 + , but it elutes as a dimer and oligomer in the absence of Ca 2 + ( Figures 3C and 3E ; Table 1 ) . Previously identiﬁed Ca 2 + - binding muta - tions in cEF1 ( Glu87Ala or Asp76Ala ) that form punctae constitu - tively ( Liou et al . , 2005 ; Mercer et al . , 2006 ; Soboloff et al . , 2006b ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ) also form persistent EF - SAM aggregates in our assay ( Table 1 ) . The Pro101Gly mutation located in the loop linking cEF1 and hEF2 ( Figure 3B ) does not affect the Figure 2 .

EF - SAM coordinates a single Ca 2 + ion ( Stathopulos et al . , 2006 ) despite the presence of an EF - hand pair . We postulated that Ca 2 + binding in the hEF2 loop was evolutionarily lost for ad - aptation to the high Ca 2 + levels of the lumen . Of the six residues involved in Ca 2 + coordination , four within STIM hEF2 loops ( Z , # , x , and z ) appear with > 10 % frequency in a survey of EF - hand proteins ( Figure 2E ) ( Marsden et al . , 1990 ) . However , the ﬁrst two liganding residues ( X and Y ) , which are highly invariant Asp residues among EF - hand proteins ( Marsden et al . , 1990 ) , occur as Phe108 and Gly110 , respectively , in STIM1 . We prepared a Phe108Asp / Gly110Asp double mutant to increase the Ca 2 + af - ﬁnity of EF - SAM via cooperative Ca 2 + binding between cEF1 and hEF2 ( Figure 3A ) , somewhat analogous to previous CaM studies ( Maune et al . , 1992 ; Starovasnik et al . , 1992 ) . This double mutant has wild - type - like EF - SAM Ca 2 + afﬁnity and binding stoichiome - try ( Figure 4A ) , but it is constitutively aggregated ( Figures 3D and 3G ; Table 1 ) ; furthermore , the secondary structure persistently ( ± Ca 2 + ) resembles Ca 2 + - free wild - type EF - SAM ( Figures 4B and 4C ) . The ability of the double mutant to bind Ca 2 + in the destabilized state is not surprising given that some residual Figure 3 .

The aberrant mobility of EF - SAM ( (cid:3) 21 kDa ) compared to the mass spectrometry - conﬁrmed molecular weight ( 17 . 4 kDa ) ( Stathopulos et al . , 2006 ) is likely due to localized regions of negative charge ( Armstrong and Roman , 1993 ) and is consistent with the delayed mobility of full - length STIM1 ( Baba et al . , 2006 ; Manji et al . , 2000 ) . Ca 2 + - loaded Phe108Asp / Gly110Asp was more susceptible to TCA hydrolysis than Ca 2 + - depleted Phe108Asp / Gly110Asp , resulting in greater apparent differences than observed in the size - exclusion chromatography for this mutant ( G ) .

Additionally , the aggregation propensity of this variant is not unexpected given that Phe108 forms part of the hydro - phobic cleft for EF - hand : SAM interactions ( Figure 2A ) . Intro - ducing a conserved Gly at position 6 ( Phe108Asp / Gly110Asp / Lys113Gly ) somewhat rescues Ca 2 + sensitivity ( Figure 3H ) ; however , the decreased stability persists , as Ca 2 + afﬁnity is greatly reduced with unknown stoichiometry ( data not shown ) . Here , the conformationally ﬂexible Gly may allow for reorgani - zation of the cleft suitable for the EF - hand : SAM intramolecular association at the cost of reduced Ca 2 + afﬁnity . The hEF2 loop mutations reveal that this motif plays a crucial role in bridging the fold between the EF - hand and SAM domains . Several modes of SAM domain interaction have been reported previously . A closed dimer is formed via swapping of N - terminal arms with additional interface contacts at the C termini ( Staple - ton et al . , 1999 ) . Another mechanism involves N - terminal arm ex - change but leaves the C termini rotated away from each other , forming a second b - interface for polymerization ( Thanos et al . , 1999 ) . The third mode occurs via two nonpolar surfaces : the mid - loop ( centrally located ) and the end - helix ( C - terminally lo - cated ) ( Kim et al . , 2001 , 2002 ) . Here , EF - SAM variants were designed in light of those SAM - mediated oligomerization models of other proteins combined with structure - based sequence alignment ( Figures 3A , 3B , and S3 ) . Trp132Arg ( loop between a 5 and a 6 ; N - terminal arm ) , Glu152Arg ( a 7 ; conserved charge ) , Ala163Arg ( a 8 ; mid - loop ) , and Leu179Arg ( loop between a 9 and a 10 ; mid - loop ) mutants retain wild - type - like EF - SAM oligo - merization properties ( Figure 3I ; Table 1 ) . However , the SAM hydrophobic core mutant Leu167Arg ( a 8 ; mid loop ) and the a 9 helix - destabilizing Thr172Arg ( mid - loop ) variant are constitu - tively aggregated ( ± Ca 2 + ) ( Table 1 ) . Since Ca 2 + binding to EF - SAM precludes oligomerization ( Figures 3C and 3E ) , the residues buried at the domain interface must play a central role in SAM - mediated associations . As expected , disruption of the EF - hand : SAM intramolecular interaction ( Figure 2 ) with Leu195Arg ( a 10 ; end - helix ) results in persistent aggregation ( Figure 3J ; Table 1 ) . Whereas Leu195 and Leu199 provide the principal hy - drophobic anchors to the EF - hand cleft , at least two other a 10 residues ( Leu192 , Val198 ) pack against the ‘‘open’’ interface of the EF - hand pair . The collective solvent exposure ( upon Ca 2 + - depletion ) of all hydrophobic a 10 interface residues likely drives SAM aggregation through the formation of thermodynamically favorable ( Figure S5D ) , intermolecular nonpolar contacts cou - pled with partial unfolding of the domain ( Figures 4B – 4D ) . Overall , Ca 2 + binding ( cEF1 ) as well as EF - hand : SAM disrup - tion ( hEF2 ; SAM - a 10 ) and SAM hydrophobic core mutations can potentiate EF - SAM aggregation in a Ca 2 + - insensitive man - ner , whereas many variants known to inhibit oligomerization in other SAM domains are incapable of constitutively monomeriz - ing EF - SAM . Amorphous Structure of Ca 2 + - Depleted and Mutant EF - SAM Since aggregate polydispersity precludes NMR and X - ray anal - ysis , we employed transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) to probe the structure of oligomerized EF - SAM . TEM of Ca 2 + - loaded wild - type EF - SAM ( 2 . 5 3 3 . 0 nm ) was beyond the resolu - tion of the instrument . Consistent with SEC ( Figure 3E ) and dynamic light scattering ( data not shown ) , a range of aggregate sizes is observed with Ca 2 + - free EF - SAM ( (cid:3) 10 to several 100 nm ) ; furthermore , the aggregates appear amorphous in all higher - order assemblies ( Figure S4A ) . TEM was also performed on the Phe108Asp / Gly110Asp mutant EF - SAM . The data show a very similar range of sizes and morphologies for the Ca 2 + - loaded and Ca 2 + - depleted mutant ( Figures S4B and S4C ) as those observed with the Ca 2 + - depleted wild - type samples . Al - though it is difﬁcult to resolve speciﬁc detail within the partially unfolded EF - SAM aggregates , the present results are in contrast to those for other SAM domains such as TEL , Yan , Scm , and pol - yhomeotic , which assemble into ordered polymeric ﬁlaments , as observed by TEM , involving primarily native - like SAM structure ( Qiao and Bowie , 2005 ) . Our results suggest a SAM interaction mechanism dependent on stability and folding of SAM in which the interaction with the neighboring EF - hand domain plays a cru - cial role ; disruption of the EF - hand : SAM interface drives oligo - merization coupled with partial unfolding . Punctae Formation and SOCE Inﬂux in Cells EF - SAM undergoes substantial destabilization upon Ca 2 + re - lease ( Stathopulos et al . , 2006 ) concurrent with aggregation , Table 1 .

These observations taken together with our mutational analysis suggest that EF - SAM stability plays a major role in STIM function . To test this supposition , we engineered Glu87Ala , Phe108Asp / Gly110Asp , and Leu195Arg variants of full - length STIM1 , N - terminally tagged with the cherry variant of green ﬂuo - rescent protein ( cherryFP ) . CherryFP - STIM1 was transiently transfected into HeLa cells , and localization was assessed by using total internal reﬂective ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . Wild - type - expressing cells show a diffuse and tubular distribu - tion coexistent with replete Ca 2 + stores ( Figure 5A ) . This appear - ance is consistent with previous studies ( Baba et al . , 2006 ; Liou et al . , 2005 ; Mercer et al . , 2006 ) in which ﬁbrillar manifestation may be linked with the subcompartmentalization of STIM1 within the ER ( Baba et al . , 2006 ) . Depletion of the luminal Ca 2 + stores with thapsigargin results in a redistribution of wild - type to distinct punctae ( Figure 5A ) . The Glu87Ala Ca 2 + - binding mutation results in constitutive punctae and insensitivity to thapsigargin ( Figure 5A ) , as observed previously ( Liou et al . , 2005 ; Mercer et al . , 2006 ; Spassova et al . , 2006 ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ) . Similarly , the hEF2 Phe108Asp / Gly110Asp and Leu195Arg destabilization mutants are insensitive to the depletion of ER stores and demon - strate persistent punctae ( Figure 5A ) . We monitored SOC channel activity by using Fura - 2 ﬂuores - cence to conﬁrm that punctae formation is linked to SOC chan - nel function . HeLa cells were transiently cotransfected with Orai1 plus cherryFP - STIM1 , and the ﬂuorescence response to the ad - dition of external Ca 2 + or thapsigargin was examined on popula - tion monolayers . Upon the addition of thapsigargin to cells bathed in Ca 2 + - free buffer , the emptying of Ca 2 + from the ER stores into the cytoplasm is observed as a similar transient in - crease in the F 340 / F 380 ratio for control and mutant transfected cells ( Figure 5B ) . Addition of Ca 2 + to wild - type - expressing and untreated cells initially bathed in the Ca 2 + - free medium results in a diminutive increase in the intracellular Ca 2 + ( Figure 5C ) . How - ever , Glu87Ala , Phe108Asp / Gly110Asp , and Leu195Arg mutants all demonstrate a sustained and marked augmentation of cyto - plasmic Ca 2 + upon extracellular Ca 2 + addition , consistent with persistently open SOC channels ( Figure 5C ) . Fura - 2 ﬂuores - cence quenching by SOC channel - permeable Mn 2 + ( Kass et al . , 1990 ) in single - cell experiments was employed to conﬁrm the population data . CherryFP - STIM1 transfected cells were ini - tially bathed in HBSS plus 1 . 5 mM CaCl 2 or HBSS plus 1 . 5 mM CaCl 2 and 2 m M thapsigargin . Fluorescence quenching was induced with the addition of 2 mM MnCl 2 . Untreated and wild - type STIM1 transfected cells show a marked increase in the quench rates when pretreated with thapsigargin , consistent with thapsigargin - induced activation of SOC channels ( Figure 5D ) . However , cells expressing the mutant proteins Figure 4 .

Both the Fura - 2 ratiometric and quench data are in full agreement with the biophysical character - ization of the EF - SAM mutants described above , underscoring that stability of the N - terminal Ca 2 + - sensing region is crucial to STIM1 function . DISCUSSION The present EF - SAM structure shows the structural architecture of a luminal EF - hand sensor tailored to the dynamic ER Ca 2 + sig - naling range of (cid:3) 100 – 800 m M ( Feske , 2007 ; Hogan and Rao , 2007 ) . The structure unveils a key functional component of STIM proteins with respect to SOCE regulation : a ‘‘hidden’’ EF - hand . This EF - hand does not bind Ca 2 + , but it is vital for EF - hand : SAM intramolecular association and the mutually linked folding and stability of the EF - SAM entity . Lack of Ca 2 + co - ordination to this ‘‘hidden’’ motif contributes to the effectively Figure 5 .

Errorbarsrepresentthestan - dard error of the mean ( SEM ) . low Ca 2 + afﬁnity of (cid:3) 250 m M of this ER - localized domain . The SAM domain as a stability - regulat - ing component within STIM1 is an additional paradigm in an already diverse set of known SAM functions that includes mediating native homo - and heterotypic SAM oligomerization , as well as non - SAM protein , lipid , and RNA binding in transcriptional , translational , and sig - nal transduction roles ( Kim and Bowie , 2003 ; Qiao and Bowie , 2005 ) . Ca 2 + - depletion of EF - SAM is functionally coupled with destabilization , which leads to partial unfolding and aggregation , as EF - SAM destabilizing mu - tations within full - length STIM1 constitutively activate SOCE . In the absence of NMR or X - ray data , we calculated a hypo - thetical ‘‘closed’’ Ca 2 + - depleted EF - SAM model based on the 3D structure of C - terminal apo - CaM ( 1F71 . PDB ) to gain insight into the submolecular oligomerization steps . The paired helices of the EF - hand domain adopt a more parallel conformation in the predicted ‘‘closed’’ mode compared to the ‘‘open’’ ( Figures S5A and S5B ) . This conformational change leads to eradication of the hydrophobic cleft , excluding SAM from intimate interac - tion with the EF - hands . The ‘‘closed’’ model predicts that Val68 , Ile71 , Leu74 , Met75 , Leu96 , Lys104 , Phe108 , Ile115 , Leu192 , Leu195 , Val198 , and Leu199 ( residues at the EF - hand : SAM interfaceinthe‘‘open’’Ca 2 + - loadedstate ) becomesol - vent exposed ( Figure S5B ) , thereby leading to an unstable state . Consistent with this hypothesis , our previous studies revealed that depletion of Ca 2 + from EF - SAM increases the overall hydro - phobicity of the protein ( Stathopulos et al . , 2006 ) , counter to what is observed for ‘‘closed’’ apo - CaM ( Figure S2B ) ( Yap Cell 135 , 110 – 122 , October 3 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . 117 et al . , 1999 ) . Furthermore , the near - UV CD of Ca 2 + - depleted EF - SAM shows little tertiary structure in the local environment of all aromatics ( cEF1 and hEF2 : 6 total with 2 Trp ; SAM : 6 total with 2 Trp ) compared to the compact structure of the Ca 2 + - loaded state ( Figure S5C ) . Additionally , the deconvoluted far - UV CD - based a helicity is 15 % versus 61 % for Ca 2 + - depleted compared to - loaded EF - SAM , respectively ( Figure S5C , inset ) . As the EF - hand region accounts for 25 % of the 61 % a helicity ( NMR struc - ture ) , the conformational destabilization must proceed through both domains . Together , the data construe an oligomerization mechanism ( Figure S5D ) by which the ‘‘open’’ Ca 2 + - loaded EF - SAM is the most stable species in the equilibrium . We believe that the ‘‘closed’’ Ca 2 + - depleted conformation is destabilized , at least in part , due to exposure of hydrophobics ( in cEF1 , hEF2 , and SAM a 10 ) and probably exists only transiently . Since the ‘‘open’’ conformation is scarcely accessible in the absence of Ca 2 + , ‘‘closed’’ EF - SAM forms oligomers in an energetically downhill mechanism of assembly . The ﬁnal aggregated EF - SAM state is coupled with partial unfolding of EF - SAM , as evidenced by CD ( Figures 4B – 4D and S5C ) . Remarkably , the aggregates can reversibly return to the well - folded monomeric state upon Ca 2 + binding ( Figures 4B and S5C ) . Meyer and coworkers ( Liou et al . , 2007 ) reported elegant in - cell studies by which they proposed a STIM1 - mediated SOCE activation model . The present study further enriches the pro - posed model by reﬁning the initial phase of the SOCE activation ( Figure 6 ) . With replete Ca 2 + stores , EF - SAM exists as a well - folded monomer and SOC channels are closed ; Ca 2 + depletion induces partial unfolding coupled with oligomerization of EF - SAM . Rapid EF - SAM oligomerization represents the SOCE initiation mechanism and is in agreement with results from full - length STIM1 live - cell experiments identifying this important Figure 6 . EF - SAM Oligomerization Initiates STIM1 Punctae Formation in the Proposed Orai1 Activation Model of SOCE WithERstoresrepleteofCa 2 + , theluminal portionofSTIM1suppresseshomotypicSTIM associations viathecompacttertiary foldofCa 2 + - loaded EF - SAM . This stable fold is promoted by intimate hydrophobic ‘‘open’’ EF - hand : SAM interactions . Ca 2 + depletion induces a ‘‘closed’’ EF - SAM conformation , exposing several hydrophobic residues on both the EF - hand and SAM domains to solvent . Oligomerization of this unstable EF - SAM conformation is energetically favorable and occurs at the luminal portion of STIM1 . This initial EF - SAM oligomerization is presumably augmented by C - terminal , homotypic coiled - coil interactions ( Baba et al . , 2006 ; Williams et al . , 2002 ) . Oligomers translocate ( Liou et al . , 2007 ) into larger assemblies at ER - PM junctions ( punctae ) ( Luik et al . , 2006 ; Wu et al . , 2006 ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ) that trigger SOC channel opening though the C - terminal portion of STIM . Nomenclature is as per Figure 1A . 118 Cell 135 , 110 – 122 , October 3 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . preliminary oligomerization phase ( Liou et al . , 2007 ) . In an appre - ciably slower event that activates the SOC channel ( half - maximal time of (cid:3) 30 – 40 s ) ( Liou et al . , 2007 ; Wu et al . , 2006 ) , oligomers translocate ( Liou et al . , 2007 ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ) and assemble into larger aggregates at ER - PM junctions ( punctae ) in the imme - diate vicinity of Orai1 ( Luik et al . , 2006 ; Wu et al . , 2006 ; Xu et al . , 2006 ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ) . The coiled - coil domains of STIM1 me - diate constitutive homotypic interactions ( Baba et al . , 2006 ; Wil - liams et al . , 2002 ) and must play an important role in the further stabilization of the EF - SAM - triggered oligomers as well as in the translocation to ER - PM junctions . The amorphous nature of EF - SAM aggregates ( Figure S4 ) also suggests an essential role for this cytoplasmic portion of STIM1 in mediating punctae ultra - structure characteristics ; hence , an orchestrated structural rear - rangement of the entire STIM1 molecule is responsible for chan - nel activation directed through the C - terminal region ( Baba et al . , 2006 ; Huang et al . , 2006 ; Liou et al . , 2007 ) . At present , it is un - clear whether the Orai1 SOC channel is opened via direct ( Ong et al . , 2007 ; Vig et al . , 2006a ; Yeromin et al . , 2006 ) or indirect ( Gwack et al . , 2007 ) coupling to STIM1 punctae . In summary , the present study demonstrates the signiﬁcance of EF - SAM olig - omerization in SOCE initiation and provides evidence for its cou - pling to partial unfolding within this luminal region of STIM mole - cules . Consistent with the inﬂuence of EF - SAM - mediated oligomerization in SOCE initiation , Luik et al . ( 2008 ) recently showed that FRB / FKBP oligomerization modules can function - ally substitute for EF - SAM , triggering Ca 2 + - independent punctae formation and Orai1 activation when crosslinked with a rapalog . The cytoplasmic coiled - coil region may contribute to the com - plexity of the aggregation and activation mechanism of STIM molecules required for Orai channel activation . Protein instability and partial unfolding associated with ag - gregation is the basis for numerous protein conformational diseases ; however , intrinsically unstructured proteins also have essential nonpathological roles in transcription , translation , posttranslational modiﬁcation , and the assembly of large protein complexes ( Dyson and Wright , 2005 ) . STIM proteins take advan - tage of this inherent ability as the foundation for SOCE activation . As protein folding and stability represent intrinsic regulatory mechanisms in the function of most , if not all , proteins , the notion of SOC channel regulation by the extrinsic stability of the luminal N - terminal region of STIM proteins is not unfounded . The ER lu - men is adapted for such a mechanism with resident molecular chaperones ( i . e . , heat shock proteins ) , folding enzymes ( protein disulﬁde isomerases ) , and stress response ( unfolded protein re - sponse [ UPR ] ) ( Hebert and Molinari , 2007 ; Ron and Walter , 2007 ) . Furthermore , thapsigargin ( i . e . , luminal Ca 2 + depletion ) is known to induce ER stress and activate the UPR ( Chen et al . , 2007 ) , whereas knockdown of STIM1 RNA fails to provoke the UPR in C . elegans intestinal cells ( Yan et al . , 2006 ) . The pres - ent molecular mechanistic study on human STIM supports these cellular observations in the worm and prompts speculation re - garding the involvement of STIM in Ca 2 + - depletion - dependent ER stress and UPR activation in other cell types . For example , STIM1 may function as an activator of the UPR due to rapid con - version to the partially unfolded state upon Ca 2 + depletion . Addi - tionally , UPR upregulation of chaperones may promote faster conversion of punctae back to the ‘‘native’’ monomeric state , suggestive of an intriguing negative feedback mechanism for SOCE . Further studies are needed to examine these and other potential roles of STIM punctae in ER function . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation Unlabeled and 15 N , 13 C - labeled EF - SAM was recombinantly expressed in E . coli and was puriﬁed under denaturing conditions as previously described ( Stathopulos et al . , 2006 ) .
