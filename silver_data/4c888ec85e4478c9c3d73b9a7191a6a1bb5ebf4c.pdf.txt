ONCOLOGY LETTERS 12 : 2371 - 2374 , 2016 Abstract . The present study aimed to identify the role of caveolin - 1 ( CAV1 ) in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( HSCC ) and identify its possible correlation with tumor clinical parameters . Expression of CAV1 was measured using immunohistochemical staining of 66 HSCC samples and 44 samples from morphologically normal tissues adjacent to the carcinomas . Expression of CAV1 in HSCC and paracancerous tissues were 71 . 2 and 9 . 5 % respectively . Levels of CAV1 expression were significantly associated with tumor differentiation , tumor - node - metastasis stage and lymph nodes metastasis ( P < 0 . 05 ) . The present study identified that expression of CAV1 in HSCC is significantly higher than in paracancerous tissues , suggesting that this high expression of CAV1 is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis . Introduction Hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( HSCC ) is a tumor with the poorest prognosis among all head and neck cancers ( 1 ) . Advances in surgical techniques and periop - erative management have improved survival rates to some extent . However , the overall 5 - year survival rate remains only 30 - 35 % ( 2 , 3 ) , despite the use of multimodal therapy , such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy ( 4 ) . Furthermore , HSCC patients have a higher risk of developing second primary tumors ( 5 ) . Therefore , it is important to study factors involved in the biological behavior of HSCC . Improved understanding may provide useful information for predicting patient prog - nosis and identifying specific molecular targets for novel treatments . Caveolae are vesicular membrane structures measuring 50 - 100 nm , which are commonly located in cell plasma membranes ( 6 , 7 ) . Caveolin - 1 ( CAV1 ) is the most important component of caveolae . It is a multifunctional scaffolding protein with numerous binding partners coded for by a gene located on chromosome 7q31 . 1 . It is also associated with cell surface caveolae and involved in regulating lipid raft domains ( 8 ) . CAV1 is associated with numerous physiological and pathophysiolog - ical processes ( 9 ) . It is involved in signaling transduction ( 10 ) , cholesterol homeostasis ( 11 ) and vesicular transport ( 12 ) , as well as tumor oncogenesis and suppression . Therefore , CAV1 may be important in the development of cancer . Previous studies have identified decreased expression of CAV1 in breast , ovarian and lung cancers , as well as sarcoma ( 13 - 17 ) . Therefore , it has been suggested that . CAV1 may inhibit cell growth and reduce tumorigenesis in oncogeni - cally transformed cells and in cancer cells ( 18 - 20 ) . However , overexpression of CAV1 has been observed in pancreatic and prostate cancer cells ( 21 , 22 ) , suggesting that the exact function of CAV1 may depend on the type of tissue it is expressed in . The aim of the present study was to investigate the specific function of CAV1 in HSCC . Materials and methods Patients and tumor tissues . All complete surgical specimens of HSCC were resected and examined from 66 patients ( 61 male , 5 female ) , with a median age of 59 . 5 years ( range , 49 - 74 years ) , with no evidence of metastasis to other organs and without prior anticancer treatment . All patients underwent hypo - pharyngeal resection at the Qilu Hospital of Shandong University between January 2013 and August 2015 . Forty - four morphologically normal tissues adjacent to the carcinomas were also collected . The resected tissues were immediately fixed with 10 % buffered formalin overnight , snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80˚C . The specimens were examined histologically after staining with eosin and hema - toxylin . The pathological stage was classified according to the tumor‑node‑metastasis ( TNM ) classification system of the International Union Against Cancer ( 23 ) . Immunohistochemistry . All specimens were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin blocks after resection . Sections were cut to 4 - µm thickness and placed on poly - L - lysine - coated glass slides . After deparaffinization in graded alcohols and xylene , epitope retrieval was carried out .

Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by immersing the sections in 3 % hydrogen peroxide for 15 min at room temperature . Sections were washed twice in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and incubated with 10 % goat serum ( Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology Co . , Beijing , China ) . Primary anti - CAV1 rabbit polyclonal antibody , ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc . , Dallas , TX , USA ) , was immersed in a 1 : 100 dilution in PBS , and the sections were incubated at 4˚C for 12 h . PBS was used instead of the primary antibody as a negative control . The polymer is a reagent labeled by peroxidase and conjugated to goat anti - rabbit antibody ( Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology , Shanghai , China ; cat no . A0208 ; diluted 1 : 50 ) . After three additional washes , the sections were incubated with polyvalent biotinylated goat anti‑rabbit antibody ( Beyotime ; cat no . A0277 ; 1 : 100 ) for 1 h at 37˚C . Sections were washed three times in PBS and incubated with streptavidin - conjugated peroxidase ( Zhongshan ; cat no . SP‑9000 ) for 30 min . Sections were then visualized by incubation with 3 , 3 - diaminobenzidine ( Zhongshan ; cat no . ZLI‑9019 ) as a chromogen for 5 min followed by washing in distilled water . After that , sections were counterstained with Mayer ' s hematoxylin for 5 min . Immunore - activity was detected with use of a standard ABC method . The immunohistochemistry kit used was from Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology Co . ( Beijing , China ) . The number of stained cells per 500 cells was ascertained using an Olympus microscope ( Olympus Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) in five visual fields at a magnification of x200 . Fields with no stained cells were given a score of 0 ; fields with > 5 % stained cells , 1 ; fields with 5‑25 % stained cells , 2 ; fields with 26‑50 % stained cells , 3 ; fields with > 50 % stained cells , 4 . The intensity of staining was then graded by comparison with a positive control . The positive control was derived from a male patient with hypopharyngeal carcinoma which was diagnosed with a moderately differentiated HSCC . No staining was given a score of 0 ; weak staining , 1 ; moderate staining , 2 ; strong staining , 3 . The expression result was considered negative when the sum of two factors was ≤3 . The expression result was considered positive when the sum of two factors was ≥4 ( 24 ) . The assessment of staining intensity was based on the same positive slides and performed independently by two observers who were blinded to the patients ' clinical information . The final result was obtained by consensus between the two observers . Statistical analysis . The Fisher exact test or chi square test was used to analyze the correlation between the patients ' parameters and CAV1 histopathological expression using the statistical software SPSS ver . 13 . 0 ( SPSS Inc . , Chicago , IL , USA ) . P < 0 . 05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference . Results Patient clinicopathological parameters .

The median patient age was 59 . 5 years ( range , 49 - 74 years ) . 32 % of patients ( 21 patients ) had early stage disease , and 74 % patients ( 44 patients ) had metastases in their lymph nodes . Details of tumor pathological parameters are shown in Table I . Expression of caveolin‑1 . Immunoreactivity , indicating expression of CAV1 , was detected in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane , and was identified by the presence of stained granular immunoreaction products ( Fig . 1 ) . Overexpression of CAV1 was observed in vascular endothelial cells ( Fig . 1D ) . Forty - seven specimens ( 71 . 2 % ) were immunoreactive for CAV1 indicating high expression , and CAV1 levels at periph - eral parts of the cancer cell nests were higher than at the central parts ; only four specimens ( 9 . 5 % ) were immunoreactive in paracancerous tissues . Compared with adjacent tissues , CAV1 protein expression was significantly higher in HSCC ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Expression of CAV1 was markedly associated with tumor differentiation grade , TNM stage and lymph nodes metastasis . The CAV1 staining results ( Fig . 1 ) demonstrated a trend of gradually increasing CAV1 intensity as the patho - logical grading increased . Additionally , CAV1 expression in well‑differentiated HSCC was significantly lower than in the group with poorly differentiated HSCC . Expression of CAV1 in patients with lymph node metastasis ( 78 . 7 % ) was significantly higher than in patients without metastasis ( 58 . 8 % , P < 0 . 05 ) . There was no correlation between CAV1 expression with age , gender or site of CAV1 expression ( P > 0 . 05 ) . Discussion Caveolae are a subdomain of lipid rafts that are defined as ‘small ( 50 - 200 nm ) heterogeneous membrane domains enriched in sphingolipids and sterol that are involved in the compart - mentalization of various cellular processes’ ( 25 ) . CAV1 is a 21 - 24 kDa protein that is an important structural component of caveolae membranes in vivo and participates in transduction processes and vesicular trafficking . It also has a regulatory role in a number of signaling pathways , such as epidermal growth factor receptor , protein kinase C , G - proteins , endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) , and Src family tyrosine kinase , which may induce development of human cancer . The differential expression of CAV1 is not a novel finding in relation to the neoplastic histotype . As stated previously , downregulation of CAV1 has been identified and reported in a variety of tumors ( 13 - 17 ) , however , its overexpression has been identified in other types of tumor ( 21 , 22 ) , indicating that the behavior of CAV1 in carcinogenesis may depend on the type of tissue it is expressed in . The present study suggests that overexpression of CAV1 in HSCC is comparable to that observed in prostate carcinoma . CAV1 overexpression was also identified to correlate with lymph node involvement , TNM stage , Gleason score , and a positive surgical margin . Previous studies have demonstrated that immu - noreactivity for CAV1 is an important and independent predictor for disease prognosis in lymph node negative patients with prostate carcinomas ( 21 ) . Thus , HSCC seems to share common features with prostate carcinoma in CAV1 immunoreactivity . It is well known that the incidence of HSCC in men is higher than that of women ( 26 ) . Sex hormones play an important C Figure 1 . Immunohistochemical staining for CAV1 . ( A ) High - grade differen - tiated hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( HSCC ) , ( B ) Medium - grade differentiated HSCC , ( C ) Low - grade differentiated HSCC . The majority of cancer cell cytoplasm was strongly stained for caveolin - 1 ( CAV1 ) . ( D ) Overexpression of CAV1 was identified in vascular endothelial cells , ( E ) Paracancerous tissues . CAV1 expression was predominantly located on the cell membrane of epithelial cells in the basal layer . CAV1 was rarely expressed on the intermediate and the upper layer . Magnification , x200 . A B D E ZHAO et al : CAV1 IS OVEREXPRESSED IN HSCC 2374 role in this disease . Nuclear estrogen receptor α levels and epidermal growth factor receptor expression are significantly increased in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( 27 ) . Prostate carcinoma growth is androgen dependent . CAV1 mediates testosterone stimulated clonal or survival growth and promotes metastatic activity in prostate carcinoma ( 28 ) . Addi - tionally , overexpression of CAV1 potentiates ligand - dependent androgen receptor activation ( 29 ) . Similar mechanisms may be involved in HSCC . The results of the current study indicate that overexpression of CAV1 may be a marker for poor HSCC cancer prognosis and lymph node metastasis . CAV1 overexpression alone cannot be relied upon to predict lymph node metastases . However , prac - titioners may use the tumor markers of biopsy specimens to improve current therapeutic strategies . Moreover , overexpres - sion of CAV1 has been identified in vascular endothelial cells . The defects in activation of eNOS with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) stimulation played a role in the inability of Cav - / - mice to stimulate angiogenesis ( 30 ) . The result was demonstrated in endothelial cells ( ECs ) from these mice . The ability of Cav - / - ECs to form tubes on Matrigel with VEGF stimulation was significantly lower than that of Cav + / + ECs . VEGF - induced nitric oxide production was greatly inhibited in Cav - / - ECs ( 30 ) . VEGF - induced phosphorylation of eNOS on Ser1177 and dephosphorylation on Thr495 were abrogated in Cav - / - ECs but not in Cav + / + ECs , both of which were considered hallmarks of eNOS activation ( 30 ) . Thus , the overexpression of CAV1 may play an important role in tumorigenesis of HSCC by positively regulating angiogenesis . Nonetheless , whether this overexpression is a crucial factor requires further study . In conclusion , the present study demonstrates that CAV1 expression is significantly higher in HSCC than that in para - cancerous tissues and is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis .
