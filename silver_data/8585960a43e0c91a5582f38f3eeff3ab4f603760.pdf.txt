Yet it remains 21 poorly understood how such complicated dynamic behaviours emerge from millisecond - scale 22 assembling activities of protein molecules , which are hard to probe experimentally . To address 23 this gap , we established a spatiotemporal “resistance - adaptive propulsion” theory based on the 24 protein interactions between Arp2 / 3 complexes and polymerizing actin filaments , and a 25 multiscale dynamic modelling system spanning from molecular proteins to the cell . Combining 26 spatiotemporal simulations with experiments , we quantitatively find that cells can accurately 27 self - adapt propulsive forces to overcome heterogeneous ECMs via a resistance - triggered 28 positive feedback mechanism , dominated by polymerization - induced actin filament bending 29 and the bending - regulated actin - Arp2 / 3 binding . However , for high resistance regions , 30 resistance triggered a negative feedback , hindering branched filament assembly , which adapts 31 cellular morphologies to circumnavigate the obstacles . Strikingly , the synergy of the two 32 opposite feedbacks not only empowers cells with both powerful and flexible migratory 33 capabilities to deal with complex ECMs , but also endows cells to use their intracellular proteins 34 efficiently . In addition , we identify that the nature of cell migration velocity depending on ECM 35 history stems from the inherent temporal hysteresis of cytoskeleton remodelling . We also 36 quantitatively show that directional cell migration is dictated by the competition between the 37 local stiffness of ECMs and the local polymerizing rate of actin network caused by chemotactic 38 cues . Our results reveal that it is the polymerization force - regulated actin filament - Arp2 / 3 39 complex binding interaction that dominates self - adaptive cell migrations in complex ECMs , 40 and we provide a predictive theory and a spatiotemporal multiscale modelling system at the 41 protein level . 42 3 Introduction 43 Cells migrate through coupling their propulsive forces generated by assembling 44 cytoskeletons to extracellular microenvironments ( ECMs ) ( 1 - 4 ) . Actin - based lamellipodia 45 protrusion is a powerful force - generating system that drives cell migrations during the cancer 46 invasion , immune surveillance , and embryonic development ( 1 , 5 - 9 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex binds 47 on an existing actin filament and then nucleates a daughter filament , assembling into branched 48 actin networks in lamellipodia and invadopodia ( 10 , 11 ) . The polymerization of the network 49 generates a pushing force to open a sufficient wide channel in ECM to drive individual or 50 collective cell migrations ( 12 - 14 ) . 51 Clinical studies show that Arp2 / 3 complex - medicated migration is tightly associated with 52 cancer invasion ( 15 - 20 ) , and patients over expressing Arp2 / 3 complex have poor survivals in 53 lung ( 16 ) , breast ( 17 ) , pancreatic ( 20 ) , and colorectal cancers ( 15 ) . In addition , the migrations of 54 immune cells , such as dendritic cells and T cells , in three - dimensional ECMs are also 55 extensively driven by the Arp2 / 3 complex formed lamellipodial protrusions ( 6 , 7 ) . However , 56 ECMs in vivo are highly mechanically heterogeneous ( 21 , 22 ) . Both invasive cancer cells and 57 immune cells need to migrate long distances to establish new tumors ( 21 , 23 ) and to find killing 58 targets ( 7 , 24 ) , respectively . Experimental studies show that the magnitude of ECM resistance 59 can affect the density of lamellipodial branched actin filaments ( 1 , 5 , 11 , 25 ) , and the 60 lamellipodial leading - edge velocity exhibits resistance - history dependent ( 1 , 26 ) . In addition , 61 cells predominantly migrate along the path of least resistance in heterogeneous extracellular 62 microenvironments ( HTECMs ) ( 6 ) . All these studies suggested that the leading edge of 63 migratory cells actively mechano - senses variations of ECMs and adapts its migrating 64 behaviour ( Fig . 1a ) ( 1 , 5 , 6 , 27 ) in response to complex ECMs . However , the migratory leading 65 edge involves highly dynamic interplays of various proteins , including Arp2 / 3 complexes , 66 actin monomers , actin filaments , Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome proteins ( WASPs ) , ATP , capping 67 4 proteins , leading - edge membrane , integrin - based adhesions and ECMs ( 5 , 10 , 11 , 28 ) . Due to 68 both the temporal and spatial cross - scale complexities ( 29 ) ( Fig . 1a ) , live imaging protein 69 behaviours at millisecond and nanometre scales is intrinsically difficult ( 30 ) . Thus , 70 quantitatively interpreting how these complicated cell - scale self - adaptive migration behaviours 71 ( Fig . 1a ) emerge from the dynamic activities of molecular proteins has been a grand and long - 72 lasting challenge ( 31 , 32 ) . It not only seriously hampers our in - depth mechanistic 73 understandings of in vivo cell migrations , but also hinders us from discovering target proteins 74 for designing new medicines and gene editing therapies to prevent cancer cells from invasions 75 or enhance immune cell infiltrations for solid cancer immunotherapy . 76 Constructing a predictive spatiotemporal multiscale modelling system that describes cellular 77 dynamic behaviours from the molecular to cellular scales at the intersection of biology , physics , 78 chemistry and computer science will greatly accelerate biomedical advancements ( 33 , 34 ) . 79 From the level of molecular protein - protein interactions , we here derive a spatiotemporal 80 ‘resistance - adaptive propulsion’ ( RAP ) theory based on the geometric nonlinear deformation 81 mechanisms of polymerizing actin filaments and the mechano - chemical assembling behaviours 82 of Arp2 / 3 complexes . The theory describes both spatial and temporal mechanical interactions 83 between the polymerizing branched actin filaments and the bent leading - edge membrane 84 constrained by ECM . On the basis of this RAP theory , we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal 85 modelling system , which encompasses dynamic actin polymerization , capping protein 86 inhabiting actin filament polymerization , nonlinear deformation of actin filaments , actin 87 monomer diffusion , ATP binding on actin monomers and Arp2 / 3 complex , mechano - chemical 88 assembly of Arp2 / 3 complex , detachments of molecular linkers , bent leading - edge membrane 89 and HTECMs . It can not only simulate dynamic cell migrations in complex environments but 90 also quantitatively shed light on synchronous interacting and assembling behaviours of 91 multiple proteins . Combining spatiotemporal simulations with experiments tracking actin 92 5 dynamics during cell migration , we quantitatively discovered a resistance - triggered positive 93 feedback mechanism at the protein level for adapting propulsive forces to overcome the 94 heterogeneity in ECM , and a resistance - triggered negative feedback mechanism for adapting 95 cell morphology to circumnavigate regions with high ECM resistance . Strikingly , the 96 combination of the two opposite feedback mechanisms along the broad lamellipodial leading 97 edge shows formidable synergistic effects , empowering cells with both powerful and flexible 98 migratory capabilities to deal with complex ECMs , and meanwhile endowing intracellular ATP 99 resource with an optimal efficiency in fuelling cell migration . These insights explain why it is 100 hard to prevent metastasis by cancer cells once they have acquired invasive ability . By 101 monitoring the assembling behaviours of proteins , we further find that the nature of migration 102 velocity depending on the resistance history of ECM is derived from the temporal hysteresis 103 of adaptive actin cytoskeleton remodelling . In addition , we reveal that directional cell 104 migration is dictated by the competition between the local stiffness of ECMs and the local 105 polymerizing rates of the leading - edge actin cytoskeleton in response to gradients of 106 chemotactic cues . Overall , we establish the first , to our knowledge , spatiotemporal biophysical 107 theory and multiscale modelling system , which can accurately predict self - adaptive cell 108 migrations in complex ECMs from protein behaviours that happen at the milliseconds in vivo . 109 Establishing such predictive biophysical theory and spatiotemporal modelling system will 110 allow computer simulations to replace some laboratory experiments to quantitatively test how 111 new drugs and gene editing technologies targeting on proteins affect cell dynamics in the future . 112 Spatiotemporal self - adaptive propulsion theory and multiscale modelling 113 system 114 Branched actin network protrusion is an important way that drives cell migrations in ECMs . 115 Through adding actin monomers to the barbed ends , polymerizing branched actin filaments 116 6 grow and thus generate pushing force on the leading - edge membrane ( 5 ) . Before being capped 117 by capping proteins , the growing length of filaments with the polymerizing time t can be 118 expressed as 119 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( , ) d C p c ap nu c t a a P on o ff t l t D k k k t                 ( 1 ) 120 where  is the radius of an actin monomer ; nu c t and c ap t are the nucleation time and the 121 capping time , respectively ; C a is the local concentration of actin monomers in the cell ; ( )   122 is the consuming factor of actin monomers , introducing the relation that polymerizing rate is 123 proportional to the ratio of the concentration of actin monomers to the density of polymerizing 124 filaments  ( 35 ) ;  is a scaled diffusion coefficient a D of actin monomers and is to introduce 125 the effect of actin filament density on the actin diffusion flux towards the polymerizing barbed 126 ends based on the Fick ' s first law of diffusion ; ( , ) p P k  is an interacting force - induced 127 probability density distribution in the rate of filament polymerization due to size - dependent 128 insertion of monomers 0 ( , ) e xp ( ) e xp ( ) d p P b k d                  ( 13 , 36 ) ; p is the 129 interaction force that the polymerizing actin filament acts on the leading - edge membrane ; b  130 is the angle of the filament barbed end relative to the normal vector of the local membrane ;  131 is a function of p and b  , and  is the size of sufficient gap to permit intercalation of 132 monomers ( 13 , 36 ) . on k and o ff k are the polymerization and depolymerization rate constants , 133 respectively . 134 The leading - edge membrane under the polymerizing force of filaments is in a bending state . 135 We simplify it into several continuous inclined planes based on the theory of differential 136 geometry ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . Though the mechanical interactions between all 137 polymerizing actin filaments and the leading - edge membrane are in three - dimensional space , 138 7 the interaction between a single polymerizing actin filament and the local membrane can be 139 described in a two - dimensional deformation plane ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . Then , 140 based on the geometric nonlinear deformation theory of continuum mechanics , the spatial and 141 temporal mechanical interactions between the growing ( polymerizing ) actin filament and the 142 leading - edge membrane is derived ( Fig . 1b , Supplementary Methods ) : 143 ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 2 ( 1 ) s i n ( , ) ( , ) [ ( 1 ( , ) ) ( 1 ( , ) ) s i n ( , ) d ] d p p + l t s t s t s t s t s t r t r t r s E I EA                ( 2 ) 144 where ( , ) s t  is the deformed angle along the actin filament due to the combined effects of 145 bending , axial compression and transverse shear under the polymerizing growth ; E ,  , A , I , 146  are the Young’s modulus , Poisson’s ratio , cross - sectional area , the second moment of the 147 cross - sectional area and shape factor of actin filaments , respectively . Using the deformation 148 compatibility condition , 149 ( ) 0 [ 1 ( , ) ] c o s ( , ) d ( ) l t s t s t s h t      , ( 3 ) 150 the nonlinear deformation function in Eq . ( 2 ) can be solved through iteration . h is the distance 151 from the pointed end of the polymerizing actin filament to the local leading - edge membrane . 152 Then , the interacting force ( ) p t , the propulsive force ( , ) f p t  in cell migration direction , the 153 total deformation energy ( ) U t and the mean bending curvature ( 0 ) ( ( ) ) ( ) ( ) l t t l t      of the 154 actin filament can all be solved ( Supplementary Fig . 4a - f ) . The total deformation energy ( ) U t 155 is expressed as 156 2 2 2 ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 0 0 2 ( ) 0 cos 1 ( cos ) cos ( ) ( 1 ) sin d ( 1 ) d 2 2 ( 1 ) ( sin ) cos ( 1 ) d p p p p = p p l t s t l t l t U t ds s s EI EA EA EA s EA EA                         ( 4 ) 157 8 Our mechanical analysis also shows that convex side surface of the bending actin filament 158 is stretched while the concave side surface is compressed ( Fig . 1c ) . Their relative strain 159 0 2 r r    where 0 r is the radius of actin filament . Experiments ( 37 ) show that in vitro long actin 160 filaments ( ~ 10μm ) exhibit large bending deformations under thermal fluctuations , and Arp2 / 3 161 complexes prefer to bind onto the convex sides of bending actin filaments . We fit the 162 experimental data of relative branched density P with an inverted sigmoid function 163 0 . 73 2 ( 1 ) P e    ( Fig . 1d ) and analyse it . Strikingly , we have , for the first time , obtained the 164 relative curvature - dependent Arp2 / 3 - actin filament dissociation constant 165 0 0 . 73 ( ) 0 . 5 ( 1 ) p d d K K e    where ( ) p d K and 0 d K are the dissociation constants in the bending 166 and straight states , respectively ( Fig . 1e and Supplementary information ) . The relative 167 0 ( ) p d d K K shows that the affinity of Arp2 / 3 complex binding on the convex surface ( negative 168 curvature side ) of actin filament is higher than the straight surface , which is higher than the 169 concave surface ( positive curvature side ) . This could be explained by the combination of our 170 mechanical analysis and the recent cryo - electron structure of Arp2 / 3 complex - actin filament 171 junction ( 38 - 40 ) ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . There are five actin subunits in mother 172 actin filament that contact with Arp2 / 3 complex , with many of the contact surfaces in the 173 grooves between these subunits ( supplementary Fig . 1a ) ( 38 - 40 ) . ArpC1of Arp2 / 3 even has a 174 protrusion helix that inserts into actin subdomains for binding ( supplementary Fig . 1b ) ( 38 , 40 ) . 175 During the polymerization of actin filaments , they generate bending deformations under the 176 constraints of cell membrane and ECM , leading to compressions on their concave sides ( Fig . 177 1b and c ) . As a result , some of the binding surfaces in the grooves on the concave side is buried 178 ( Fig . 1c ) , inducing the decrease of the binding affinity of Arp2 / 3 . On the contrary , the groove 179 sites on the convex side of the bending actin filaments undergoes stretch ( Fig . 1c ) , which 180 facilitates Arp2 / 3 complex binding and improves Arp2 / 3 binding affinity . To better show this 181 force - dependent binding affinity , we also calculate the relative dissociation constant 182 9 1 2 ( ) ( ) p p d d K K where 1 ( ) p d K and 2 ( ) p d K are the dissociation constants on the convex and 183 concave surfaces , respectively , demonstrating that the binding affinity on the convex surface 184 is much higher than the concave surface ( Fig . 1f ) . Our theoretical analysis has shown that 185 although in vivo actin filaments are relatively short ( ~ 250nm ) , their polymerization force still 186 can induce them to generate significant backward bending deformations , which could be 187 verified by the actin retrograde flow phenomenon ( 41 ) and the recent measurement that the 188 bending curvature can reach up to 10 µm - 1 ( 42 ) . This indicates that the force - dependent Arp2 / 3 189 complex - actin filament binding affinity occurs in vivo . To incorporate that Arp2 / 3 complex 190 has a higher binding affinity with the convex surface of actin filaments than with straight 191 surface , we introduce a bending curvature - dependent binding factor m a x ( ) a r p d  , which is 192 defined as the space between two adjacent Arp2 / 3 complex branches along an actin filament , 193 where m a x  is the biggest bending curvature in the deformation history of the actin filament ( Eq . 194 S14 ) . The number of Arp2 / 3 complexes binding on the i th actin filament with a polymerization 195 length ( ) i l t of can be determined as max / ( ) arp arp i i i n l d   . The probabilities that an Arp2 / 3 196 complex binding on the convex and concave side of an actin filament are 197 ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ] P P P      and ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ] P P P       , respectively . Thus , the total number of 198 actin filaments ( ) N t pushing against the leading - edge membrane at time t is 199 ( ) m a x 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) m t a r p i i i N t n m t      , ( 5 ) 200 where ( ) m t is the number of mother filaments . During cell migrations , some filaments are 201 linked to the leading - edge membrane through molecular linkers , such as Ezrin and N - 202 WASPs ( 12 , 43 - 45 ) , and generate a resultant attachment force ( ) , 1 ( ) f t a k k t    to pull back the 203 membrane where ( ) t  and f a are the total number of attaching molecular linkers and 204 10 attaching force of each molecular linker , respectively . The total number of tethered filaments 205 ( ) ( ) t N t    , where the parameter  is the percentage of the total number of actin filaments 206 contacting with the leading - edge membrane . In the static state , the leading edge of migrating 207 cells follows force balance ( Fig . 1g ) : 208 ( ) ( ) , , 1 1 ( , ) ( ) ( ) ( ) = f f f f N t t p j j a k m E C M j k t t t t         , ( 6 ) 209 where ( ) f m t and ( ) f ECM t are a backward tension force from the leading - edge membrane and a 210 resistance force from ECM , respectively . The total elastic deformation energy stored in all 211 branched filaments pushing the leading - edge membrane is ( ) 1 ( ) ( , ) = N t j j j t U t     . Experiments 212 showed that the motion of branched actin filaments is saltatory with a step size S  of about 1 - 213 10nm with time ( 46 , 47 ) due to the detachment of molecular linkers ( 13 , 43 , 48 ) . Actually , in 214 vivo , cell migration involves not only the detachments of molecular linkers from leading - edge 215 membrane ( 43 ) , but also the local ruptures of some nascent integrin adhesions ( 49 ) and 216 extracellular crosslinking matrix networks owing to the propulsive force ( 21 , 50 ) . Since these 217 processes are very complex and also involves different energy barriers , in order to capture the 218 key characteristics of cell migration , we assume that when the resultant propulsive force 219 ( ) , 1 ( , ) = f N t p j j j t   is larger than the maximum resultant stall force ( ) , 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) f f f t a k m E C M k t t t      , some 220 molecular linkers will detach from the leading - edge membrane ( 43 ) and thus cell will migrate 221 forward with a leaping step size S  . Then , the position of the leading edge of the cell at time 222 1 t  can be expressed by 223 ( 1 ) ( 1 ) , , 1 1 ( 1 ) ( 1 ) , , 1 1 ( ) ( , 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( ) ( , 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) = = S f f f f S S S f f f f N t t p j j a k m ECM j k N t t p j j a k m ECM j k t if t t t t t t if t t t t                                       ( 7 ) 224 11 and the transient average migration velocity V is / S t   . The dynamic leading - edge 225 migration should meet the force balance defined by 226 ( 1 ) ( 1 ) , , 1 1 ( , 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) S S S S = f = f f f N t t p j j a k m E C M j k t t t t                  ， ， ( 8 ) 227 Because the present theory is derived from the spatiotemporal mechanical interactions between 228 the polymerizing branched actin filaments and the leading - edge membrane constrained by 229 extracellular resistance , and incorporates the force - dependent assembling behaviours of 230 proteins , we name it spatiotemporal ‘resistance - adaptive propulsion’ ( RAP ) model . 231 To quantitatively shed light on how the assembling behaviours of multiple proteins impact 232 on the dynamics of cell migration , we further develop a multiscale spatiotemporal modelling 233 system by applying the RAP theory and integrating the stochastic behaviours of proteins 234 ( Supplementary Methods ) . This modelling framework systematically encompasses the in vivo 235 actin monomer nucleation , actin filament polymerization , capping protein terminating filament 236 polymerization , mechano - chemical nucleation of Arp2 / 3 complex , ATP binding , bent leading - 237 edge membrane , detachments of molecular linkers , protein gradients caused by chemotactic 238 cues , integrin - based adhesion and heterogeneous ECMs . Using this bottom - up approach , we 239 can span multiple scales in both space and time to investigate cell migration behaviours in 240 complex ECMs , and thus shed light on their dominating biophysical principles from the level 241 of specific proteins . 242 ECM resistance - triggered positive feedback adapts propulsive force 243 High extracellular resistance results in denser lamellipodial branched actin filaments during 244 cell migrations ( 1 , 5 ) . To explore quantitatively whether our spatiotemporal RAP theory can 245 reproduce this significant behaviour and reveal its underlying biophysical mechanism , we 246 perform spatiotemporal simulations of cell migrations in both mechanically homogeneous 247 12 extracellular microenvironment ( HMECM ) and HTECM ( Fig . 2a ) . we observe that when the 248 resistance f ECM is 0 . 5 nN / µm ( the normal range is 0 . 1 – 2 . 0 nN / μm of ECM ( 51 ) ) in the HMECM 249 condition , the density of polymerizing branched actin filaments  stably fluctuates in a very 250 narrow range 230 – 270 / µm ( Fig . 2a ) , agreeing well with the experimental data 150 – 350 251 / μm ( 51 ) . However , in the HTECM , when the extracellular resistance f E C M increases from the 252 low resistance ( LR ) 0 . 5 nN / µm to a higher resistance ( HR ) 1 . 0 nN / µm , the branched actin 253 density  increases by ~ 35 % ( 320 – 350 / µm , Fig . 2a ) . After f ECM returning to the low 254 resistance ( RLR ) 0 . 5 nN / µm , the density also decreases to its previous level ( Fig . 2a ) . The 255 density of Arp2 / 3 complex assembling actin cytoskeleton cofluctuates with the resistance ( Fig . 256 2b ) . Strikingly , our model well predicts the experimentally measured correlations between the 257 extracellular resistance and the lamellipodial branched actin filament density during cell 258 migration in refs . ( 1 , 5 , 11 ) ( Fig . 2a ) . The architecture of the lamellipodial branched actin 259 network generated in our spatiotemporal simulations is also consistent with the experimental 260 measurements ( Fig . 2c ) ( 52 ) . In addition , we show that when cells encounter higher resistances , 261 the consumption rate of ATP ( Fig . 2d ) increases to fuel cell migrations . This prediction is also 262 validated by the experimental data ( Fig . 2d ) that mitochondria and ATP levels are higher at the 263 invasive cell leading edge in a stiffer ECM confinement ( 11 ) and that cancer cells overproduce 264 ATP to boost their lamellipodia formations and invasions ( 53 ) . 265 Next , we analyse the spatiotemporal propulsive force ( Fig . 2e ) and the elastic deformation 266 energy  stored in the branched filaments ( Fig . 2f ) . It is found that both synchronously 267 fluctuate with the density of branched actin filaments . We further quantitatively identify that 268 the adaptation of filament density is to meet the propulsive force and energy demands for 269 overcoming the varying extracellular resistance . To shed light on the more fundamental cross - 270 scale biophysical mechanism of such significant adaptive behaviours in response to ECMs , we 271 13 then examine the assembly of protein molecules that happens at milliseconds , finding an ECM 272 resistance - triggered positive feedback ( Fig . 2g ) . When the resistance f E C M increases , 273 polymerizing ( growing ) actin filaments under the ECM confinement will automatically have 274 larger nonlinear bending deformations ( Supplementary Movie ) , which increase the probability 275 that Arp2 / 3 complex will bind and nucleate daughter actin filaments , and vice versa . Through 276 this mechanism , cells can adapt the density of branched actin network and thus the propulsive 277 force and energy for migrations . More importantly , through the extent of bending deformations , 278 cells can sense the ECM resistance , so a larger resistance induces a larger bending deformation . 279 Thus , from the protein level , we reveal that migrating cells can sensitively sense the immediate 280 variations of ECM resistance through the polymerizing growth of actin filaments , and then 281 accordingly make accurate adaptive responses in filament density , propulsive force and energy 282 through the mechano - triggered Arp2 / 3 complex - actin filament assembling behaviours ( Fig . 2g ) . 283 This mechanism also endows migrating cells with an optimization ability to accurately employ 284 their intracellular proteins and ATP ( Fig . 2a , b and d ) according to their demands in complex 285 ECMs . 286 Leading - edge velocity depends on the temporal hysteresis of filament density 287 adaptation to varying ECM 288 We next explore how the leading - edge migration velocity responds to the varying stiffness 289 of the ECMs and how the underlying biophysical mechanisms operate at the level of protein 290 molecules . The spatiotemporal simulations in HTECMs show that when migrating cell 291 encounters an increased extracellular resistance f ECM , its leading - edge migrating velocity V 292 suddenly decreases from 3 . 3 µm / min to 0 . 7 µm / min ( from stage Ⅰ to Ⅱ in the black ellipse in 293 Fig . 2h ) , which is lower than the velocity 1 . 7 – 5 . 2 µm / min in the HMECMs with f ECM = 0 . 5 294 nN / µm . However , with the continuing polymerization of branched filaments , the decreased 295 14 velocity partially recovers . This is owing to the gradual increase in the filament density based 296 on the ECM resistance - triggered positive feedback . Afterwards , we reduce the extracellular 297 resistance from 1 nN / µm to its previous value 0 . 5 nN / µm for the HTECMs . Strikingly , the 298 leading - edge velocity abruptly increases to a very high value 10 . 7 µm / min , and then gradually 299 decreases to the previous range 1 . 7 - 5 . 2 µm / min ( Fig . 2h ) . The spatiotemporal predictions from 300 stage Ⅰ to Ⅴ are validated by the experimental data ( Fig . 2h ) ( 1 , 26 ) . To gain insight into the 301 protein behaviours , we check the evolution of the spatiotemporal remodelling of the growing 302 lamellipodial actin network . Previous studies ( 26 ) described this phenomenon as velocity 303 dependence on loading history . Here , we quantitatively show that the nature of the leading - 304 edge velocity variations in the HTEMCs stems from that the adaptation of branched actin 305 filament density is always temporally hysteretic to its triggering reason , i . e . , varying ECM 306 resistance ( Fig . 2i ) . This is because the generation of daughter filaments and their growths to 307 the leading - edge membrane always cost some time due to actin monomer nucleation , filament 308 polymerization , Arp2 / 3 activation and assembly ( Fig . 2i ) . Although the extracellular resistance 309 f ECM has increased or decreased , the density , propulsive force and deformation energy of 310 polymerizing actin filaments keep unchanged in this process . Thus , the velocity suddenly 311 decreases because of incapable of overcoming the increased resistance , and increases because 312 of easily overcoming the decreased resistance to release the excess deformation energy , 313 respectively ( Fig . 2e and f ) . This also indicates that , in HTECMs , there exists no one - to - one 314 correspondence between V - f ECM that can describe the leading - edge migrating behaviours . 315 However , in HMECMs , the one - to - one V - f ECM relationship exists . 316 15 High ECM resistance - triggered negative feedback adapts cell morphology 317 for pathfinding 318 The above study focuses on the low ranges of ECM resistance . However , the leading edge 319 usually faces some local dense collagen regions with high resistances in ECM . Thus , we here 320 investigate migratory pathfinding in this kind of complex ECMs and shed light on its 321 underlying mechanistic operating basis at the protein level . We design an ECM as 322 demonstrated by Fig . 3a . The ECM is divided into two stages . In the first stage ( from 0 to 110 323 nm ) , it is mechanically homogeneous and has a resistance f E C M of 0 . 5 nN / µm . However , in the 324 second stage ( from 110 to 300 nm ) , its resistance becomes 1 . 0 nN / µm , and there are two very 325 dense collagen regions with a very high resistance f r i gh t E C M = f l e ft E C M = 5 nN / µm . 326 Spatiotemporal simulations show that , in the first homogeneous mechanical environment , 327 the left , central and right parts of the leading edge migrate forward synchronously with similar 328 velocities ( Fig . 3b ) . The density of branched actin filaments is approximately homogeneous 329 ( Fig . 3c ) . However , when the cell encounters the two dense collagen ECM regions , it stops 330 moving forward from the left and right sides , and turns to squeeze out from the central region 331 where the resistance is weak ( Fig . 3b ) . Unexpectedly , even though the leading edges on the left 332 and right sides have not overcome their local resistances , the increase of the density of actin 333 filaments stops ( red ellipse area in Fig . 3c ) . Interestingly , this indicates that when the ECM 334 resistance is very high , the mechanism of resistance - triggered positive feedback no longer work . 335 We perform experiments to validate this spatiotemporal model prediction . We record 336 Human retinal pigment epithelial - 1 ( RPE1 ) cells expressing green fluorescent protein linked to 337 a small peptide ( Lifeact - GFP ) with affinity for actin microfilaments . We image the dynamic 338 cell migration processes in the microchannels with constrictions ( Fig . 3d ) , and track the 339 temporal actin intensity when the cell encounters the constriction regions . The experimental 340 16 results of the temporal variations of leading - edge actin intensity are strongly consistent with 341 our modelling predictions ( Fig . 3e ) . We then check how our spatiotemporal simulations operate 342 at the protein level ( Fig . 3f and g ) . Migrating cells apply the resistance - triggered positive 343 feedback to adapt filament density and propulsive force to try to overcome the obstacles until 344 high forces between the leading - edge membrane and actin filaments ( Fig . 3h ) compromise the 345 intercalations of actin monomers with the barbed ends ( Fig . 3f ) , which stops the bending 346 deformation of filaments ( Fig . 3i ) and the assembly of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3g ) . These results 347 of our simulation are strongly validated by in vitro experiments ( 25 ) . We also find that the 348 porosity of the leading - edge actin network is reduced due to the increased density of actin 349 filaments ( Fig . 3j ) . This lowers the diffusion of actin monomers to the free barbed ends , and 350 reduces the polymerization rate at the leading edge ( Fig . 3k ) . 351 Unexpectedly , we find that an ECM resistance - triggered negative adaptation feedback ( Fig . 352 3l ) coexists with the resistance - triggered positive adaptation feedback ( Fig . 2g ) in migrating 353 cells . While the positive feedback adapts cell propulsive force to overcome ECMs , the negative 354 feedback can adapt cell morphology by stopping actin polymerization to circumnavigate the 355 high resistance regions in ECMs . This behaviour can avoid unnecessary consumptions of 356 intracellular proteins and ATP resources ( Fig . 3f and g ) , and thus improve cell migration 357 efficiency . The synergy of the two opposite feedbacks allow the leading edge to discriminate 358 whether the local ECM confinement is weak to overcome or strong enough to require 359 circumnavigation with a formidable efficiency . It endows cells with both powerful and flexible 360 migration capabilities to widely adapt morphologies to the complex ECMs ( Fig . 3m ) . This may 361 explain why cancer metastasis is extremely hard to prevent once they acquire invasive ability . 362 In addition , our results reveal that the initiation of cellular morphology adaptations , a prominent 363 characteristic of invasive cancer cells , derives from the leading edge sensing strong barriers 364 and escaping from them . 365 17 Directional cell migration is steered by a balanced and competing relation 366 Cells typically follow the gradients of chemotactic cues to migrate ( 6 ) . The nucleus of 367 migrating cells acts as a mechanical gauge to make a temporary adaptations while choosing a 368 passable path ( 6 , 54 , 55 ) . Given the global migration direction predefined by chemotactic cues , 369 leading edge is much more important in persistently directing cell migration towards the final 370 destination . Our simulations demonstrate that different local stiffness of ECM results in 371 different local densities of branched filaments along the leading edge . Here , we investigate 372 another challenging problem of how the complex interplays between the multiple simultaneous 373 factors of extracellular resistance , density heterogeneity of branched actin filaments , and the 374 external diffusible chemotactic stimuli synergistically steer directional cell migration in 375 HTECM . We introduce a gradient diffusion of a localised chemotactic cue sensed by 376 transmembrane receptors ( Fig . 4a ) , rendering a gradient distribution of intracellular actin 377 monomers . We design and simulate three cases A – C ( Fig . 4b ) , in which local leading edges at 378 the positions of x 1 and x 2 simultaneously drive cell migrations . Based on the experimental 379 observations ( 6 ) , it is reasonable to hypothesize that the fastest migration direction of local 380 leading edges is the main migration direction of a cell . Our simulations in case A show that the 381 migration distance of the leading edge at the position x 2 are larger than those at the position x 1 382 ( Fig . 4c ) , concluding that when the extracellular mechanical microenvironments are 383 homogeneous , cells more actively migrate toward the site where the local concentration of actin 384 monomers is higher . Since homogeneous ECM induces homogeneous density of branch 385 filaments in the whole leading edge ( Fig . 4d ) , a higher local concentration of actin monomers 386 means that sufficient actin monomers can be supplied to the polymerizing barbed ends of the 387 local branched actin filaments . The chemotactic cue determines the local protein concentration 388 to steer directional cell migration . Then , we test case B , in which the left and right sides are 389 designed to have the same local concentrations of actin monomers due to homogeneous 390 18 distribution of the chemotactic cue , but different extracellular resistances . Cells migrate toward 391 the low resistance x 1 side ( Fig . 4e ) , because higher resistance on the right - side results in denser 392 branched actin filaments there ( Fig . 4f ) , which deplete action monomers locally and thus slows 393 polymerization rate at barbed ends . This case highlights that extracellular resistance plays a 394 determining role in directing cell migration . However , the results of case C ( Supplementary 395 Fig . 5 ) , in contrary to case B , shows that cells migrate toward the high resistance x 2 side ( Fig . 396 4g ) . Even though the denser polymerizing filaments consume more action monomers on the x 2 397 side ( Fig . 4h ) , the strong chemotactic cue can sustain a high local concentration of actin 398 monomers , which enable branched actin filaments to polymerize at a higher rate than that on 399 the x 1 side . Although here we take actin monomers as an example , local variations in the 400 concentrations of other intracellular proteins , such as Arp2 / 3 complex , WASPs , FMNL , aprin 401 and profilin , have the same effect on cell migration by enhancing or inhibiting nucleation , 402 branch formation and filament polymerization . 403 From the distinct results of cases A – C , we find that directional cell migration is not solely 404 steered by either the gradients of intracellular proteins induced by chemotactic cues or the local 405 stiffness of ECMs . It is a balanced competing consequence between the two ( Fig . 4i and j ) . 406 While strong chemotactic cues improve the local nucleation , branch formation and 407 polymerization rate of actin filaments , stiffer local ECMs result in denser local branched actin 408 filaments , which in turn reduce these rates and slow down cell migration . In addition , through 409 the collaboration of the resistance - triggered positive feedback mechanism and the high 410 resistance - triggered negative feedback mechanism , here our results further indicate that as long 411 as the chemotactic cues are strong enough in sustaining the high gradients of proteins for 412 keeping a high branching and polymerizing rates , the leading edge will drive cells to migrate 413 globally and persistently toward the prescribed final destination by overcoming weak 414 confinements and circumnavigating strong barriers encountered . 415 19 Discussions 416 Although cell migrations have been studied many decades , how cells mechano - sense and 417 make self - adaptive responses to complex ECMs at the protein level still remains elusive . In 418 this study , by analysing the spatiotemporal nonlinear deformation of polymerizing actin 419 filaments and the polymerization force - regulated Arp2 / 3 complex - actin filament binding 420 interactions , we derive a spatiotemporal ‘resistance - adaptive propulsion’ ( RAP ) theory for cell 421 migrations . Then , with the RAP theory , we develop a spatiotemporal multiscale modelling 422 system , which can not only simulate dynamic cell migrations in ECMs , but also shed light on 423 the assembling behaviours of single proteins . Our simulations predict many important spatial 424 and temporal adaptive cell migration behaviours observed experimentally and clinically ( Table 425 1 ) , and reveal their underlying operating mechanisms emerged from proteins behaviours . 426 We find that it is the polymerization force - regulated actin filament - Arp2 / 3 complex binding 427 interaction that dominates self - adaptive cell migrations in complex ECMs , through the 428 synergistic effects of positive and negative feedbacks . The polymerization - induced bending 429 state of actin filaments serves as the mechano - sensor of cells . Our finding is highly consistent 430 with two recent studies that show bending force ( 42 ) and polymerization force ( 56 ) evoke 431 nucleotide - state conformational changes of actin filaments and thus affect the binding 432 behaviours of actin - binding proteins . In fact , mechanical force - induced conformational change 433 of proteins is a key regulator of protein - protein interactions ( 57 ) , thereby regulating 434 physiological and pathophysiological cellular behaviours . 435 Previous studies indicated that increased extracellular resistance induced denser branched 436 actin filaments in the migration leading edge ( 1 , 5 , 25 ) . Here , we identify that the enhanced 437 leading - edge actin filament density is to improve the propulsive force and energy to overcome 438 the resistance . Our results physically interpret why Arp2 / 3 complex overexpression is tightly 439 20 associated with cancer cell invasions ( 15 - 19 ) , poor patient survival in cancers ( 58 ) and high 440 migratory force ( 59 ) . We indicate that Arp2 / 3 is a key target protein for developing anti - cancer 441 drugs , especially for patients in the advanced stages of cancer . It should be mentioned that the 442 current simulations are for the conditions that integrin - based adhesions are sufficient for fixing 443 the branched actin network . In the event that the levels of integrin or vinculin are not abundant , 444 it is conceivable that high ECM resistance could trigger a rapid actin retrograde flow ( 41 , 60 ) 445 based on the positive feedback , resulting in an increased backward movement of the branched 446 actin network and subsequently reducing the velocity of cell protrusion . This represents an 447 additional type of negative feedback mechanism that can arise from excessively high ECM 448 resistance . 449 It should be emphasized that polymerization of Arp2 / 3 complex - branched actin filament 450 network is the most important way for cells to generate propulsive forces to interact with their 451 surrounding microenvironments and perform their functions . It participates in phagocytosis of 452 immune responses ( 61 ) , endocytosis ( 62 ) , dendritic spine formation of cortical neurons ( 63 ) , T - 453 cell and cancer cell interactions ( 64 ) , and promoting of DNA fork repair ( 65 ) and chromatin 454 organization ( 66 , 67 ) . All these processes require cells to mechano - sense the surrounding 455 microenvironments and then make adaptive force generation responses . Thus , besides cell 456 migrations , our cross - scale findings and the spatiotemporal multiscale modelling system can 457 also be applied to investigate these dynamic physiological cell activities . 458 21 Materials and Methods 459 Cell culture 460 Human telomerase - immortalized , retinal - pigmented epithelial cells expressing GFP - LifeAct 461 ( CellLight Actin - GFP , BacMam 2 . 0 from Thermo Fischer Scientific ) were grown in a 462 humidified incubator at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 in DMEM / F12 supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine 463 serum and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin . All cell culture products were purchased from 464 GIBCO / Life Technologies . Cell lines were regularly checked for mycoplasma contamination 465 ( MycoAlert , Lonza ) . 466 Cell fixation and immunostaining 467 Cells were pre - permeabilized in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in cytoskeleton buffer for 15 s for 468 tubulin and then fixed in 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( no . 00216 - 30 ; Polysciences ) in cytoskeleton 469 buffer with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and 10 % sucrose for 15 min at room temperature . Cells were 470 then washed three times with PBS - tween 0 . 1 % and incubated in a quenching agent of 1mg ml - 471 1 sodium borohydride for 10 min at room temperature . After fixation , the cells were washed 472 with PBS - Tween 0 . 1 % and then blocked with 3 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) overnight . The 473 cells were incubated with appropriate dilutions of primary antibodies in PBS containing 3 % 474 BSA and 0 . 1 % Tween overnight at 4 °C in a humid chamber . After washing three times with 475 PBS - tween 0 . 1 % , the coverslips were then incubated with appropriate dilutions of secondary 476 antibodies diluted in PBS containing 3 % BSA and 0 . 1 % for 1 h at room temperature in a humid 477 chamber . After washing three times with PBS - Tween 0 . 1 % , coverslips were then mounted onto 478 slides using Prolong Gold antifade reagent ( no . P36935 ; Invitrogen ) . Here , we used rat 479 monoclonal antibodies against α - tubulin ( no . ab6160 , Abcam ) and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti - 480 rat ( 1 : 500 , no . A21434 ; Invitrogen ) as secondary antibody . Antibodies were diluted as followed 481 for immunofluorescence : α - tubulin ( primary : 1 : 500 ) and secondary ( 1 : 1000 ) . For actin 482 22 immunofluorescence , Phalloidin - Atto 488 ( 49409 , Sigma - Aldrich ) was used to and diluted as 483 1 : 1000 to stabilize actin filaments in cells . 484 Cell migration under constriction 485 Micro - channels were prepared as previously described ( doi : 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 61779 - 207 - 486 6 _ 28 ) . Briefly , polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS , 10 / 1 w / w PDMS A / crosslinker B ) ( GE 487 Silicones ) was used to prepare 12 μm wide and 5μm high micro - channels with a constriction 488 of 2 μm . For confined migration in Fig . 3d , coverslip and micro - channels were treated by 489 plasma for 1mins and then were stuck together at 70 °C for 10mins . Before cell seeding , the 490 microchannels were treated with fibronectin at 10 μg ml - 1 for 30mins and incubate with culture 491 medium for 3 hrs at room temperature . GFP - LifeAct RPE1 cells were then seeded in the 492 microchannels with a concentration at 2x105 cells ml - 1 . Imaging was performed after the 493 overnight incubation of the microchannels . 494 Imaging 495 Images of the immunostainings were acquired on a Zeiss LSM900 confocal microscopes 496 ( Axio Observer ) using a 63x magnification objective ( Plan - Apochromat 63X / 1 . 4 oil ) . Image 497 acquisition for time - lapse of GFP life - act RPE1 cells in constrictions was performed on a 498 confocal spinning - disc system ( EclipseTi - E Nikon inverted microscope equipped with a 499 CSUX1 - A1 Yokogawa confocal head , an Evolve EMCCD camera from Roper Scientific , 500 Princeton Instruments ) through an 63x magnification objective ( Nikon CFI Plan Fluor 60X / 0 . 7 501 oil ) objective every 4 s during 2 hrs for each time - lapse . The set - up was equipped with a live 502 cell chamber , and the temperature was constantly kept at 37 °C . Labelled - actin was excited 503 with a 491 nm laser line , and emission was observed with a standard GFP filter . The microscope 504 was monitored with MetaMorph software ( Universal Imaging ) . 505 Spatiotemporal theoretical model and dynamic multiscale modelling system 506 23 The derivation of the spatiotemporal biophysical theory and the developing process of the 507 spatiotemporal multiscale dynamic modelling system are provided in the Supplementary Text . 508 509 Data availability 510 The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author 511 on reasonable request . 512 Author contributions 513 X .

RAP model systematically predicts all the key adaptive migratory behaviours 801 discovered in experiments . 802 Key lamellipodial leading edge behaviours during cell migrations Adaptive propulsive force generation based on ECM resistance ( 1 ) The orientation of actin filaments in lamellipodial is about ±35° relative to the migration direction ( 1 , 52 ) . Increased ECM resistance induces the increase of branched actin filament density ( 1 , 5 , 11 ) . Increased resistance induces the decrease in the rates of actin nucleation and capping of barbed ends ( 25 ) . Increased resistance induces the decrease in the rates of Arp2 / 3 branching ( 25 ) . Overexpression of Arp2 / 3 complex is positively related to cell migratory ability and velocity ( 15 , 17 , 59 ) . Increased ECM resistance leads to denser mitochondria at the Arp2 / 3 complex - assembled invasive cell leading edge and ATP can boost cancer leading edge invasion ( 11 , 53 ) . Migratory leading edge can circumnavigate obstacles and select the path of least resistance ( 6 ) . Leading edge migration velocity depends on extracellular resistance history ( 1 , 26 ) . 803 804 35 805 Supplementary Fig . 1 .

Firstly , we investigate the mechanical interactions between a polymerizing actin filament and the curved leading - edge membrane . Near the leading - edge membrane of the lamellipodium , the pointed ends of actin filaments connect with the branched actin network via Arp2 / 3 complex , which is a relatively rigid protein - protein binding connection ( 3 ) . The branched actin network has a high stiffness ( 4 , 5 ) and is fixed by adhesions during cell migration ( 6 ) . Therefore , the polymerizing actin filaments are assumed to be fixed at their pointed ends . The leading - edge membrane is bent due to the propelling force of the growing branched actin filaments ( 7 ) . According to the theory of differential geometry , we divide the curved leading - edge membrane into several continuous inclined flat plane segments ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . The leading - edge membrane is first assumed to be fixed due to the confinement of the extracellular matrix . When a polymerizing actin filament gets in contact with the membrane , it becomes bent and the interaction force between the bent actin filament and the local plat segment of the membrane is in the direction normal to the flat segment . Though the force interaction between all the bent polymerizing actin filaments and the leading - edge membrane is in three - dimensional space , the interaction between a single polymerizing actin filament and the local flat plane segment of the membrane ( i . e . , inclined plane ) can be described in a two - dimensional deformation plane , which contains the whole bent actin filament ( Supplementary Fig . 2c and Fig . 1b in the Main Text ) . 3 In our model , the barbed and pointed ends of the polymerizing actin filament are denoted as 0 s  and ( ) s l t  , respectively . Before the polymerizing barbed end reaches the inclined local leading - edge membrane , i . e . , ( ) c o s l t h   , they have no interaction force ( p 0  ) and thus the actin filament is straight . As the actin filament grows in length with the polymerizing time , its barbed end gets in contact with the membrane , i . e . , ( ) c o s l t h   , the growing filament is compressed and bent due to the constraint from the leading - edge membrane . When the angle ( 0 )  of the barbed end is less than / 2  , the growing barbed end slides along the membrane in the deformation plane and they have a point contact . The deformed configuration of the actin filament and the interaction force p acting on the leading - edge membrane is shown in Fig . 1b in the Main Text . It is noted that for simplicity , the possible friction between the bent actin filament and the membrane is ignored , thus the force p is always in the normal direction of the local leading - edge membrane . The relation between the bending curvature and the bending moment is expressed as ( ) 0 ( , ) p [ 1 ( , ) ] s i n ( , ) s t b d s t r t r t d r d s E I        ( S1 ) p c o s ( , ) ( , ) r t r t EA    ( S2 ) where 0 r s   ; E is Young’s modulus of actin filaments and is taken as 2GPa ( 8 ) ; A and I are the cross - sectional area and the second moment of the cross - sectional area of the actin filaments , and they can be calculated from the diameter ( 7 nm ) of actin filaments . At the pointed end of the actin filament , i . e . , ( ) s l t  , [ ( ) , ] b l t t   . It is noted that b  equals  plus the local rotation of the filament resulted from bending , and  equals  plus the local rotation of the filament resulted 4 from both bending and transverse shear . Thus , the angle ( ) b s  along the deformed actin filament as a result of the combined effects of bending , axial compression and polymerization growth can be determined as ( ) ( ) ( ) 0 p ( , ) [ ( 1 ( , ) ) ( 1 ( , ) ) s i n ( , ) ] l t s t b s t s t s t r t r t d r d s E I            ( S3 ) The angle s  induced by the transverse shear deformation of the polymerizing actin filament is expressed as p s i n ( , ) 2 ( 1 ) p s i n ( , ) ( , ) s s t s t s t G A EA          ( S4 ) where v is the Poisson’s ratio of the actin filament material and is taken to be 0 . 3 ( 8 ) ; and  is the shape factor and is 10 / 9 for a circular cross - section . Thus , the total angle of the deformed actin filament is ( , ) ( , ) ( , ) b s s t s t s t      ( S5 ) For a polymerization length of the actin filament at time t , the nonlinear function ( , ) s t  can be determined using the iterative method and the following deformation compatibility condition : ( ) 0 [ 1 ( , ) ] c o s ( , ) ( ) l t s t s t d s h t      ( S6 ) To solve the function ( , ) s t  , we reverse the interacting process by using the local leading - edge membrane ( i . e . , a plat plane ) to compress the actin filament to meet the condition given by equation ( S6 ) . More specifically , the actin filament is first assumed to be straight . Then , we divide it into 100000 equal linear segments and apply the load p in the normal direction of the local leading - edge membrane to compress the actin filament at its barbed end , as shown in Fig . 1b in the Main 5 Text , by very small increments of p  ( 0 . 01pN ) using an iterative method . The initial axial compressive strain  is chosen as p c o s ( , ) s t EA   with the initial angle ( , ) s t    . Using the deformation compatibility condition ( ) h t in equation ( S6 ) , the convergent solution of ( , ) s t  and the corresponding force p acting on the leading - edge membrane can be obtained by the iterative method . Our nonlinear theory is validated by the finite element method ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . The mean curvature  of the geometrically nonlinear deformed actin filament is given as ( 0 ) ( ( ) ) ( ) ( ) l t t l t      ( S7 ) The total elastic strain energy in the actin filament , ( ) U t , is the summation of the bending energy ( ) b U t , axial compression energy ( ) c U t and transverse shearing energy ( ) s U t , that is , ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) b c s U t U t U t U t    ( S8 ) where 2 ( ) ( ) ( ) 2 2 0 0 0 ( ) 1 p p c o s ( ) ( ) [ ( 1 ) s i n ] 2 2 l t l t s t b b t U t E I d s d s d s d s E I EA          ( S9 ) 2 ( ) 0 1 ( p c o s ) p c o s ( ) ( 1 ) 2 l t c U t d s EA EA      ( S10 ) 2 ( ) 0 ( 1 ) ( psin ) pcos ( ) ( 1 ) l t s U t ds EA EA         ( S11 ) When the angle ( 0 )  at the barbed end increases to / 2  , the barbed end of the actin filament will have a line contact with the local leading - edge membrane ( Fig . 1b in the Main Text ) . Thus , with the continuing polymerization , the actin filament has no further deformation and the interaction force p and the deformation energy U keep constant . It is worth mentioning that the interaction 6 force p is in the direction normal to the local leading - edge membrane , rather than in the direction of cell migration . The propulsive force f p ( in the direction of cell migration ) acting on the local leading - edge membrane by the actin filament can be expressed by f ( ) p ( ) c o s p t t   ( S12 ) where  denotes the angle between the normal direction of the local leading - edge membrane and the direction of cell migration . The dynamic interactions between a polymerizing actin filament and the leading - edge membrane , which is confined by the ECM , are shown in Supplementary Fig . 4a - f . It shows that the polymerizing actin filaments experience large backward nonlinear deformations due to the constraint of the leading - edge membrane and extracellular matrix , which is validated by experimental observations ( 4 , 5 , 9 ) , and is also the nature of the actin retrograde flow formation . Arp2 / 3 complex has a heterodimer formed by the two subunits , Arp2 and Arp3 . The heterodimer bonded with ATP mimics a filamentous actin dimer and thereby creates a template for branching out a daughter actin filament from a mother filament ( 10 , 11 ) . We analyze the conformational deformations of the curved surfaces , both convex and concave sides , of a bending mother filament that potentially interacts with Arp2 / 3 complex , showing that the convex surface is stretched while the concave surface is compressed ( Fig . 1c ) . Their relative strain r  relating to the polymerization force - induced bending states can be quantitatively described by 0 2 r r    where 0 r is the radius of actin filaments ( Fig . 1c ) . Experiments ( 12 ) show that in vitro long actin filaments ( ~ 10μm ) exhibit large bending deformations under thermal fluctuations , and the relative branched density P , which is the ratio of the number of branch points with different curvatures to the corresponding number of mother actin filaments , is larger in the convex side than in the concave side . We fit the experimental data of P with an inverted 7 sigmoid function 0 . 73 2 ( 1 ) P e    ( Fig . 1d ) , which is more reasonable than a linear fitting because the relative branched density should be neither minus nor excessively high . The dissociation constant d K between Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments is expressed by      Arp AF ArpAF d K  where   Arp ,   AF ,   A r p A F are the equilibrium concentrations of Arp2 / 3 complex , actin filaments , and the Arp2 / 3 - actin filament branches , respectively . Since     A r p A F A F P  , the dissociation constant becomes   A r p d K P  . Thus , compared to the straight state of actin filaments , the relative curvature - dependent Arp2 / 3 - actin filament disassociation constant 0 ( p ) d d K K is     0 0 . 73 A r p ( ) ( 0 ) ( p ) 0 . 5 ( 1 ) A r p ( 0 ) ( ) d d P P K K e P P        ( S13 ) where ( p ) d K and 0 d K are the dissociation constants in the bending and straight states , respectively ( Fig . 1e ) . The relative 0 ( p ) d d K K shows that the affinity of Arp2 / 3 complex binding on the convex surface ( negative curvature side ) of actin filament is higher than the straight surface , which is higher than the concave surface ( positive curvature side ) . This could be explained by the combination of our mechanical analysis and the recent cryo - electron structure of Arp2 / 3 - actin filament junction ( 11 , 13 , 14 ) that the stretched convex surface of a bending actin filament exposes the groove binding sites for Arp2 / 3 complex , which facilitate Arp2 / 3 complex binding , while the compressed concave surface buries some binding sites ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . To better show this force - dependent binding affinity , we also calculate the relative disassociation constant 1 2 ( p ) ( p ) ( ) ( ) d d K K P P     where 1 ( p ) d K and 2 ( p ) d K are the dissociation constants on the convex and concave surfaces , respectively , demonstrating that the binding affinity on the convex surface is much higher than the concave surface ( Fig . 1f ) . Our theoretical analysis has shown that although in vivo actin filaments are relatively short ( ~ 250nm ) , their polymerization force still can induce them to generate significant backward bending deformations , which could be verified by the actin retrograde flow phenomenon and the recent measurement that the bending curvature can reach up to 10 µm - 8 1 ( 9 ) . This indicates that the force - dependent actin - Arp2 / 3 binding affinity occurs in vivo . To incorporate that Arp2 / 3 complex has a higher binding affinity with the convex surface of actin filaments than with straight surface , we introduce a bending curvature - dependent binding factor m a x ( ) a r p d  to the model ( Eq . S14 ) , which is a segmented function and is defined as the space between two adjacent Arp2 / 3 complex branches along an actin filament , where m a x  is the biggest bending curvature in the deformation history of the actin filament . Since experiments have shown that most of the space a r p d between two adjacent Arp2 / 3 branches is 100nm ( 1 , 15 ) , it is appropriate to hypothesize that the relation between a r p d and the maximum curvature m a x  in deformation history follows m a x m a x m a x m a x 300 0 0 . 3 ( ) 150 0 . 3 1 100 1 a r p if d if if               ( S14 ) The units of the space a r p d is nm . In the sufficient amount of Arp2 / 3 complex condition , the number of Arp2 / 3 complexes binding on an actin filament with a length of i l can be determined as m a x / ( ) a r p a r p i i n l d   ( S15 ) The probabilities that an Arp2 / 3 complex binding on the convex and concave side of an actin filament are ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ] P P P      and ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ] P P P       , respectively . Then , Arp2 / 3 complexes branch out daughter actin filaments from mother actin filaments and thus form the lamellipodial branched actin filament network . During cell migration , the extracellular resistance force is normally in the range of 0 . 4 nN / μm to 2 nN / μm ( 16 ) . The leading - edge membrane tension force is about 360 pN / μm ( 17 ) . The molecular linking attachment force between the barbed ends of actin filaments and the leading - edge membrane , which drag the membrane backward ( 18 - 20 ) , is estimated at 20 pN per molecular linker ( 21 - 24 ) . The polymerization force of the branched actin 9 network pushes leading - edge membrane to overcome these resistance forces and thus drive the cell to migrate in the ECM . Spatiotemporal multi - scale modelling system Next , we develop a modelling system to spatiotemporally simulate that the three - dimensional lamellipodial self - assembling branched actin filaments drive cells migration forward . In this framework , the interactions between the growing branched actin filaments and the curved leading - edge membrane , which is confined by the varying immediate ECM , are described by the RAP model . The complicated stochastic assembling process and mechano - chemical reactions , such as the highly dynamic actin polymerization , capping protein inhabiting filament growth , Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation and molecular linker detachment between the filament barbed end and curved leading - edge membrane , are systematically incorporated . The lamellipodium usually has a thickness of about 200 nanometers and a width of about 20 - 50 micrometres ( 25 ) . Thus , we generate a lamellipodial domain of 10 , 000 nm × 1 , 000 nm × 200 nm and use periodic boundaries in the width direction . During cell migration , the propulsive force of the actin filaments bends leading - edge membrane ( 7 ) . By referring to the differential geometry theory , we divide the smoothly curved leading - edge membrane into N inclined flat plane segments 1 2 [ , , . . . . . . , ] P N p p p  as shown in Supplementary Fig . 2 . The k th membrane plane has a point with coordinates of x p k and a normal vector x n pk . Let x p and x n p be the concatenations 1 2 [ , , . . . . . . , ] x x x pT pT pT T N and 1 2 [ , , . . . . . . , ] x x x n n n p p p T T T T N , respectively . During lamellipodium driving cell migration , the leading - edge protrude forward in the extracellular matrix . Thus , the equations ( , ) M P t of these inclined flat plane segments P in three - dimensional space can be written as 10 ( P , ) ( ( ) ) ( ) 0 M x - x x n p p T t t t    ( S16 ) In our simulations , the leading - edge membrane is divided into six inclined planes . Then , we generate a certain concentrations of actin monomers C a , Arp2 / 3 complex C a r p , capping proteins and ATP in the lamellipodial space . The distribution of actin monomers is defined by a gradient extracellular chemoattractant ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . These actin monomers stochastically nucleate into a certain number n of short actin filaments , and the pointed end coordinates x f p i of the i th actin filament are randomly and independently generated . For each an actin filament growing in the lamellipodial sheet - like space , a local spherical coordinate system is created by regarding its pointed end as the origin . This local spherical coordinate system is used to determine the orientation and the barbed end coordinates ( , , ) f b f b f b i i i r   of each actin filament confined in the lamellipodium . Published experimental results showed that the orientation of actin filaments relative to the cell migration direction is generally around ±35° ( 26 ) . Thus , the orientation angles of the initial actin filaments are randomly produced by a normal distribution and a uniform distribution defined as ( 70 , 110 ) ; ( 35 , 15 ) i i U N        ( S17 ) The behaviour of actin is coupled to the nucleotide bound to its active site , and ATP hydrolysis is activated during polymerization ( 27 ) . Thus , the polymerization process of actin filaments is simulated by adding individual actin monomers bonded by an ATP to the barbed ends . The growth rate fil V of the polymerizing free barbed end of an actin filament is expressed as ( ) [ ( , ) ( , ) C ( p , ) ] fil a a P on off V t t D t k k k           ( S18 ) 11 where  is the radius of an actin monomer ; C a is the local concentration of actin monomers in the cell ; ( )   is the consuming factor of actin monomers , introducing the relation that polymerizing rate is proportional to the ratio of the concentration of actin monomers to the density of polymerizing filaments  ( 28 ) ; cap t and cap t are the nucleation and capping time of the actin filament , respectively .

Let x f p be the concatenation 1 2 [ , , . . . . . . . , ] x x x fpT fpT fpT T n . Thus , before the barbed ends attach the leading - edge membrane , their coordinates ( ) x fb t at time t are specified by 12 ( ) ( ) x r A x fb fb fp t t    ( S20 ) ( ) ( ) r I t fb s fil t V t   ( S21 ) 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 s i n c o s s i n c o s c o s s i n c o s s i n c o s c o s . . . . .

In lamellipodia , actin filaments can normally grow to a length of about 200 nm ( 1 , 32 ) . Thus , we assume that when an actin filament grows to its maximal length , which is generated by the normal distributions ( 200 , 50 ) N , capping proteins will cap its barbed end and the polymerization will stop . Thus , the final lengths of actin filaments can also be expressed by t t t t ( ) ( ) ( ) C ( p , ) r c ap c ap nu c nu c f b fil a a P on o ff t V d t D k k k d t                   when ( c ap t t  ) ( S23 ) where 1 2 ( , , . . . . . . , ) t cap cap cap capn diag t t t  with c ap i t being the time that a capping protein binds on the barbed end of the i th actin filament . The final coordinate fbi z of its barbed end in the lamellipodial sheet - like space should be within the domain given by   | 0 200 fb fb i i z z   ( S24 ) Once their barbed ends reach the leading - edge membrane , the spatiotemporal mechanical interaction between the polymerizing actin filaments and the bent protruding leading - edge membrane can be described by our RAP theoretical model . The whole process of lamellipodia protrusion is in a highly dynamic state . N - WASP proteins form molecular linkers between the 13 barbed ends of actin filaments and the leading - edge membrane . Meanwhile , Arp2 / 3 complexes are activated by Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome proteins ( WASPs ) . Then , they bind on actin filaments and branch out new actin filaments . The probabilities of the Arp2 / 3 complex binding on the convex and concave sides of an actin filament are ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ] P P P      and ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ] P P P       , respectively . To identify the binding coordinates of the Arp2 / 3 complex along actin filaments during this dynamic process , we create a series of local Cartesian coordinate systems   , , x y z    by regarding the pointed end of each actin filament as the origin O  . Plane . O x y    . is the deformation plane of the bent actin filament and axis O x   is the normal vector of the inclined leading - edge membrane flat plane segment . For the j th Arp2 / 3 complex on the i th actin filament , which pushes against the inclined leading - edge membrane plane segment k , the deflection vector ( ) x i k j t   of the binding point of the Arp2 / 3 complex in the local coordinate system i k i k i k i k O x y z     at time t can be calculated with the RAP theoretical model .

Matrices B i , x f p i and I i all have m rows . The Jacobian determinant is calculated from the transformation relationship between the local ( i k i k i k x y z    ) and global ( xy z ) Cartesian coordinate systems . The length of Arp2 / 3 complex a r p r is normally about 10 nm ( 33 ) . The subunits Arp2 and Arp3 bind ATP via nucleotide - binding domains , and then assemble branched actin network through hydrolysis of ATP ( 34 ) . During this process , Arp2 / 3 complex binds on the convex side of a bent actin filament ( 12 ) with an angle of ~ 70° ( 3 ) . Thus , the possible branching position of Arp2 / 3 complex is constrained on a half conical surface around the actin filament . The azimuthal angle arpikj  of Arp2 / 3 complex in its local spherical system is also generated by a uniform distribution ( 70 , 110 ) U   . Because the forthcoming daughter actin filament will grow out from the Arp2 / 3 complex , angle arpikj  also should allow the daughter filament to polymerize to a length dfikj r specified by a normal distribution ( 200 , 50 ) N . Therefore , the azimuthal angle arpikj  and the end point 15 coordinates ( ) x a e i k j t , i . e . , the vertical vector [ ( ) , ( ) , ( ) ] a e a e a e i k j i k j i k j x t y t z t , of the j th Arp2 / 3 complex on the i th actin filament interacting with the local leading - edge membrane segment k at time t should satisfy   | 0 ( ) c o s 150 a r p a e d f a r p i k j i k j i k j z t r      ( S29 ) 2 ( ( ) ( ) ) ( ( ) ( ) ) 0 x x x x a r p a e a s T a e a s i k j i k j i k j i k j r t t t t      ( S30 ) 2 2 ( ) ( ( ) ( ) ) ( c o s ) ( ) ( ) ( ( ) ( ) ) ( ( ) ( ) ) x x x x x x x x x l o c a l T a e a s l o c a l T l o c a l a e a s T a e a s i k j i k j i k j i k j i k j i k j i k j i k j i k j t t t t t t t t t                ( S31 ) where ( ) x l o c a l i k j t  is the local tangent vector of the bent actin filament segment where Arp2 / 3 complex binds . This vector updates with time because of actin filament polymerization , leading - edge membrane protrusion and their dynamic interaction , and can be calculated with the RAP model .  denotes the angle between the mother filament and the Arp2 / 3 complex , and is generated by a Gaussian distribution of ( 70 , 2 ) N   . Thus , the end point coordinates ( ) x a e i k j t of Arp2 / 3 complex can be specified and updated by using the equations ( S29 - 31 ) . After the binding of Arp2 / 3 complex , daughter actin filaments will nucleate there . The concatenation matrix of the pointed ends of daughter actin filaments 1 2 ( ) [ ( ) , ( ) , . . . . . . , ( ) ] x x x x d f p a e T a e T a e T T q t t t t  and q is the total number of Arp2 / 3 complex . Then , the daughter filaments polymerize by adding actin monomers onto their barbed ends in the branching direction of the Arp2 / 3 complex . The positions of the daughter filaments are also in a dynamic state with Arp2 / 3 complex , and can be determined by the deflection equations of their mother filaments calculated from the RAP model . Like the mother actin filaments , the polymerizing daughter filaments will also mechanically interact with the leading - edge membrane and be bent . Their spatiotemporal positions are updated by the RAP model . New activated Arp2 / 3 complex by 16 WASPs will also bind on these daughter filaments and branch out next generation daughter actin filaments . With the increase in the number of actin filaments pushing against the leading - edge membrane , the leading - edge membrane will protrude forward . Consequently , these bent actin filaments will straighten , either partially or totally . Meanwhile , the assembling and mechano - chemical reactions between these different proteins are constantly taking place , remodeling and organizing new lamellipodial cytoskeleton to drive cell migrations in ECMs .
