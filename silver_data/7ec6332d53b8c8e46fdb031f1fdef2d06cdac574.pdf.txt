Background For the first time in late December 2019 , cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause were reported in Wuhan , China , and later in January 2020 , a new type of coronavirus was identified as the cause of those pneumonia cases [ 1 ] . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) chose the official name of COVID - 19 ( stand for coronavirus disease 2019 ) , for the disease , as well as the term SARS - COV - 2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ) for the virus [ 2 ] . A similar to SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) coronaviruses trend has been seen in the epidemiology of this emerging disease [ 3 ] . In March 11 , 2020 , the WHO announced COVID - 19 as a pandemic [ 4 ] . The disease is highly contagious and each infected person could infect at least 3 other people on average [ 5 ] . As of , April 15 , 2020 , 76389 patients with COVID - 19 have been identified in Iran , of which 4777 deaths have been occurred by the virus . According to statistics , Iran ranks sixth after the United States , Italy , Spain , , France and the United Kingdom in the number of deaths due to COVID - 19 [ 6 ] . The first deaths from COVID - 19 reported officially on Feb 19 , 2020 [ 7 ] . Identifying the epidemiological characteristics of this disease will help to make appropriate decisions and thus control the epidemic . Certain epidemiological features of COVID - 19 have been previously reported [ 8 - 11 ] . However , these studies were based on relatively small sample sizes , and mostly from China . The aim of this study was characterization of the epidemiological features of COVID - 19 in Iran as a country with a population of more than 83 million people [ 12 ] in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf region . Here , we report the results of an epidemiological analysis J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 of all cases hospitalized in Baqiyatallah Hospital , affiliated to Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences ( BMSU ) , in Tehran , Iran . 2 . Method 2 . 1 . Study design and data collection The present study was a retrospective , epidemiological study that has been performed on hospitalized cases of COVID - 19 in Baqiyatallah hospital in Tehran . According to hospital data , patients were admitted from 19 February 2020 , to 15 April 2020 . All patient information is kept confidential . Patients were confirmed by RT - PCR ( Reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ) using throat and nose swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract or clinically diagnosed based on lung imaging features specially Chest CT ( Computed tomography ) scan ground glass pathognomonic features consistent with coronavirus pneumonia , depending on the physician ' s orders . All registered cases at the hospital had a national unique code , so there were no duplicates . The study variables were as follows : gender , age , final outcome ( including death or survival ) , type of comorbidities . 2 . 2 . Statistical Analysis Descriptive analyses of the variables were expressed as mean ( ±Standard Deviation = SD ) , median ( with an interquartile range = IQR = Q 1 - Q 3 ) , or number ( % ) . The analyses were based on non - missing data , and missing data were not imputed . The age and sex distribution were examined and relevant charts were drawn . Sex ratio ( male to female ) and the case fatality rate ( CFR ) were calculated . To investigate the effect of age , gender , and comorbidities on mortality , a multiple logistic regression model was used . Adjusted Odds Ratio ( OR ) with 95 % Confidence Interval ( CI ) J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 was calculated . The α : 0 . 05 was considered as a significance level . The data were analyzed using the STATA version 11 . 0 and Excel version 2010 . 3 . Results From February 19 , 2020 to April 15 , 2020 , a total of 12870 patients referred to the hospital emergency department , of which 2968 were hospitalized with COVID - 19 diagnosis . The mean of age was 55 . 50 ±15 . 15 years and the median of age was 56 ( 46 - 65 ) years . The majority of cases were in the age group of 50 to 60 years ( Fig 1 ) . Also , most cases ( 66 % ) were male . The male - to - female ratio was 1 . 93 : 1 . CFRs are shown in Table 1 . Totally 239 deaths occurred during the entire study period , so the overall CFR was calculated to be 1 . 85 % based on the total number of patients ( both outpatient and inpatient ) and also CFR was calculated to be 8 . 06 % among hospitalized patients . Among the 239 deaths , the mean of age was 65 . 38 ±13 . 67 years and the median of age was 65 ( 57 - 75 ) years . A majority ( 160 = 66 . 94 % ) were ≥60 years of age and 38 ( 15 . 89 % ) had comorbidities . Patients over 80 years of age had the highest CFR among the age groups ( 19 . 27 % ) . The CFR was 8 . 54 % and 7 . 13 % for men and women , respectively . A total of 323 ( 10 . 89 % ) of patients had chronic underlying diseases . As shown in Fig 2 , Diabetes , chronic respiratory diseases , hypertension , cardiovascular diseases , chronic kidney diseases and cancer were the most common comorbidities with 3 . 81 , 2 . 02 , 1 . 99 , 1 . 25 , 0 . 60 and 0 . 57 % , respectively . While patients who reported no comorbidity had a CFR of 7 . 61 % , patients with comorbid conditions had higher rates ( 9 . 73 % for diabetes , 10 . 81 % for those with cardiovascular disease , 15 % for those with chronic respiratory disease , and 13 . 55 % for those with hypertension , 16 . 66 % for chronic Kidney diseases and 5 . 88 % for patients with cancer . Fig3 indicates the number of cases as well as deaths based on the date of J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 admission from February 19 , 2020 to April 15 , 2020 . The results of logistic regression showed that male gender significantly increased odds of death by 45 % ( OR = 1 . 45 , 95 % CI : 1 . 08 - 1 . 96 ) . Also , for a one - year increase in the age , the odds of death increases by 5 % ( OR = 1 . 05 , 95 % CI : 1 . 04 - 1 . 06 ) . Having underlying disease also increases the odds of mortality by 53 % ( OR = 1 . 53 , 95 % CI : 1 . 04 - 2 . 24 ) this was also statistically significant ( Table 2 ) . 4 . Discussion The present epidemiological study on 2964 COVID - 19 hospitalized cases between 19 February 2020 to 15 April 2020 , provides information about the disease and the outbreak in Iran . As shown in Figure 1 , the increasing trend of hospitalized cases over a short period of time ( 19 February to March 11 ) is clear . This finding could confirm the rapid spread of the disease in the population . The peak of hospitalization occurred on March 11 , and since March 17 , the number of hospitalized cases has decreased slightly . The data appear to indicate a propagated source pattern of spread . Estimates suggest that around 14 % of people infected with COVID - 19 have severe disease , and 6 % are critically ill [ 13 ] , hence , about 20 % of all cases of the disease are usually need to be hospitalized . Since Baqiyatallah Hospital is a referral center in Tehran , so , it can be concluded that there is probably a similar trend in the general population . Among the 239 deaths , a majority ( 160 = 66 . 94 % ) has been ≥60 years of age and 38 ( 15 . 89 % ) had comorbidities such as diabetes , hypertension and chronic respiratory diseases and etc . According to the results of our study , overall CFR was calculated to be 1 . 85 % based on the total number of patients ( both outpatient and inpatient ) . Other studies have been reported CFR ranged from 2 . 5 % to 3 % , [ 14 , 15 ] . CFR was also calculated to be 8 . 06 % among hospitalized patients , it is not surprising that the CFR among hospitalized patients was high as patients with a better general condition who were not hospitalized and therefore not included in the denominator . A recently published systematic review and meta - J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 analysis reports a CFR of over 13 % in 7 studies describing 632 hospitalized patients [ 16 ] . Also , two studies from China , reported a CFR of 15 % [ 8 ] and 11 % [ 9 ] , respectively . Besides , in a study the CFR has been reported to be as high as 49 % among critical hospitalized cases [ 17 ] . The results of logistic regression showed the significant effects of age , male gender and underlying diseases on risk of death in patients with COVID - 19 . In line with other studies [ 18 , 19 ] the regression analysis in our study revealed that older age is associated with higher risk of mortality . Some studies showed that older age is associated with declined immune system ability [ 20 ] . Previously , older age has been reported as an associated factor for mortality in SARS [ 21 ] and MERS [ 22 ] . The present study showed that male gender significantly increases mortality ( OR = 1 . 45 , 95 % CI : 1 . 08 - 1 . 96 ) . We also observed a greater number of males than females in the 2964 cases of COVID - 19 infection . MERS - CoV and SARS - CoV have also been found to infect more men than women [ 23 , 24 ] . This finding is consistent to other studies [ 9 , 25 ] . The less susceptibility to infection among women could be attributed to the X chromosome and sex hormones , which have been reported to play role in innate and adaptive immunity [ 26 ] . Furthermore , according to our results , 10 . 89 % of patients had chronic underlying diseases , mainly diabetes , chronic respiratory diseases , hypertension and cardiovascular diseases ; this is similar to MERS - CoV [ 24 ] . In line with other studies [ 27 - 29 ] , our result also showed that , having comorbidities had a statistically significant effect on Mortality ( OR = 1 . 53 , 95 % CI : 1 . 04 - 2 . 24 ) . A study suggested that compared to patients with no comorbidities , the risk of death in patients with influenza is more than in those who had cardiovascular disease and hypertension [ 30 ] . As far as our knowledge shows , the present study is the first descriptive study of the COVID - 19 outbreak in Iran , with a large sample size . Although the sample size in the present study is a major advantage , unfortunately , more detailed patient information , particularly regarding clinical outcomes and early symptoms was unavailable J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 at the time of analysis . Importantly , this may limit the conclusions from this data . However , the data in this study permit an early assessment of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID - 19 cases in Tehran , Iran . Further studies in outpatient , primary care , or community settings would help to get a full picture of the clinical presentation , natural history , risk factors and the spectrum of clinical severity of the disease . In addition , further efforts should be made to compensate for the above mentioned limitation in future studies . Rapid , reliable and feasible diagnostic tests are important , as well as differential diagnoses based on clinical descriptions by physicians . Careful national surveillance is essential to monitor the disease and its epidemiological characteristics including infectivity , host adaption , viral evolution , transmissibility , and pathogenicity . Efforts and initiatives at the national , regional and global levels need to be made to cut off the disease transmission chain . 5 . Conclusion The results of this study emphasize the significant effect of older age , male gender and underling diseases on the risk of mortality among COVID - 19 patients , which has been mentioned previously in other studies . So it is recommended to take preventative measures more seriously in the elderly patients . Also regarding medical care , it is important to pay special attention to elderly patients who also have underlying diseases . As COVID - 19 is considered a global health threat , it still needs to be investigated deeply .
