While the basic physical properties of homogeneous membranes are relatively well known , the effects of inhomogeneities within membranes are very much an active ﬁeld of study . Membrane domains enriched in certain lipids , in particular , are attracting much attention , and in this Letter we investigate the effect of such domains on the shape and fate of membrane tubes . Recent experiments have demonstrated that forced lipid phase separation can trigger tube ﬁssion , and we demonstrate how this can be understood purely from the difference in elastic constants between the domains . Moreover , the proposed model predicts time scales for ﬁssion that agree well with experimental ﬁndings . DOI : 10 . 1103 / PhysRevLett . 93 . 158104 PACS numbers : 87 . 16 .

Compartmentalization and trafﬁck - ing aid it in doing so , and both processes extensively use membranes . Not only are the various organelles in eu - karyotic cells surrounded by membranes , but the basic intermediates in the intracellular transport pathways as well are membrane structures such as tubes and vesicles [ 1 ] . The generation and properties of these structures have been extensively studied , and much is already known about their biology , biochemistry [ 2 ] , and biophysics [ 3 , 4 ] . The emerging view is that the shape of the bilayer membrane in vivo is controlled not only by embedded and associated proteins [ 5 ] but also to a large extent by the mechanical properties of the bilayer itself [ 3 , 6 ] . For tubular structures , in particular , mechanical effects play a major role : recent biomimetic experiments [ 4 ] have shown that kinesin motors walking on microtubules can exert pulling forces on the membrane and prompt the formation of membrane tubes that resemble tubules iden - tiﬁed in living cells . The existence of small membrane domains with a lipid composition that is markedly different from that of the rest of the membrane ( sometimes referred to as ‘‘rafts , ’’ although considerable debate remains as to their precise interpretation ) appears to be another key element of intra - cellular vesicular trafﬁc [ 7 ] and also seems to be impli - cated in a multitude of cellular processes [ 8 ] . The heterogeneity in membrane composition can be attributed to a phase transition leading to a local segregation be - tween the various lipids constituting the membrane [ 9 ] . Sphingolipid domains , in particular , have been shown to be more structured than a classical liquid membrane due to speciﬁc interactions between their constituents [ 1 ] . Under appropriate conditions they tend to aggregate into so - called liquid - ordered domains which are mechani - cally stiffer than the rest of the bilayer . Recently , an experimental model system of vesicles including ‘‘raft - like domains’’ has been developed [ 10 ] ; it provides an elegant and efﬁcient tool to study their properties in a more controlled way than in vivo . This procedure allows for systematic studies of the effects of membrane compo - sition [ 11 ] , temperature changes [ 9 ] , and protein absorp - tion on the domain [ 12 ] . The physics of membrane tube formation from homo - geneous vesicles has been studied both theoretically [ 13 , 14 ] and experimentally [ 15 ] . Recent experiments in - volving one of us [ 16 ] study the interplay between lipid domains and the behavior of tubes , by pulling tubes from model membranes . Figure 1 illustrates one of the surpris - ing conclusions of these experiments—a sequence of snapshots taken at regular intervals ( 1 s between two pic - tures ) shows an initially homogeneous tube that ﬁrst undergoes phase separation ( triggered experimentally by photoinduced oxidation of cholesterol ) , and , after about 1 s , ruptures precisely at the phase boundary and discon - nects . The two lipid phases are easily distinguished , once separation has occurred , by the use of a ﬂuorescent FIG . 1 . Breakage of a heterogeneous membrane tube [ 16 ] . The brighter ( and thinner ) section initially on the tip is a liquid - disordered DOPC domain . Fission events occur at the sites of formation of small domains resulting from phase separation .

Furthermore , the same experiments show that ﬁssion events such as these happen only in the phase separated tubes—tubes in which the lipids are mixed are essentially stable indeﬁnitely . Statement of problem and summary . — In this Letter , we address the dramatic loss of stability following phase separation from a mechanical point of view . We extend the theoretical models developed for homogeneous tubes [ 14 ] to study the junction between two distinct phases , each of which far away from the junction has a tubular shape . Experiments suggest that phase separation occurs on a much faster time scale than ﬁssion and that the nucleation of the two phases leads to the formation of cylindrical domains between a more rigid and a less rigid phase . Therefore , we do not model the dynamic of the phase separation process [ 17 ] . The tube radii and the junction length are generally small compared to the length of each phase domain . In order to minimize the interfacial energy between adjacent domains , the inter - face rapidly becomes a circle perpendicular to the tube direction . The coarsening stage of the phase separation process proceeds very slowly to eventually form two homogeneous phases in equilibrium , but this slow relaxa - tion is always preempted by tube ﬁssion . We assume here that the tube and junctions are axi - symmetric with respect to the direction along which the tube is pulled ( the z axis ) . We consider one junction between two semi - inﬁnite tubes , each consisting exclu - sively of one of the phases . Finite - size effects associated with the limited size of individual domains , while possi - bly relevant , fall outside the scope of the present Letter . The small radius of the tubes ( about 40 nm ) does not allow for a quantitative determination of the shape of the junctions [ 16 ] , and for this reason we restrict ourselves to a minimal model which emphasizes the roles of the most relevant physical parameters . We show that tube ﬁssion can be driven either by the line tension or by the jump of the elastic coefﬁcients at the interface between the two phases , and we compare the two processes , both of which undoubtedly contribute in the experiments . Model . — We use an elastic membrane free energy , as introduced by Canham and Helfrich [ 18 ] , and numeri - cally determine equilibrium junction shapes . Figure 2 gives a schematic representation of the tube and the coordinate system used in the following . Our axisymmet - ric surface is parametrized by the arc length s along the contour and described by the local tube radius r (cid:1) s (cid:2) and the angle (cid:1) s (cid:2) . They are related by the geometric relations _ r (cid:3) cos ( dots denote derivatives with respect to s ) . The interface is located at z (cid:3) s (cid:3) 0 . The free energy of the system is obtained by extending the description of tubular membranes [ 14 ] to the speciﬁc case of a biphasic tube [ 19 , 20 ] as follows : F (cid:3) X i (cid:3) (cid:8) ; (cid:10) Z (cid:8) i (cid:3) 2 (cid:11) i H 2 (cid:4) (cid:11) (cid:1) i (cid:2) G K (cid:4) (cid:12) i (cid:4) dS (cid:4) I @ (cid:8) (cid:16)d‘ (cid:5) Z fdz : ( 1 ) The two phases are denoted by (cid:8) and (cid:10) , and for each phase i the free energy is integrated over its membrane area (cid:8) i . The (cid:11) i and (cid:11) (cid:1) i (cid:2) G are the bending and Gaussian rigidities of the respective phases . This free energy in - cludes the bending energy to lowest order in the principal curvatures , where H is the mean curvature and K the Gaussian curvature . The two layers of the membrane are assumed to be symmetric ; both phases contain cholesterol molecules which have a high ﬂip - ﬂop rate . Any stress due to area differences between the leaﬂets or to an asymme - try of the layers is thus quickly relaxed . Finally , Lagrange multipliers (cid:12) i are introduced to ensure a constant surface in each phase . These (cid:12) i are interpreted as surface ten - sions . We take our tube to be inﬁnite and assume the presence of a lipid reservoir . In the experiments , such a reservoir is provided by the large mother vesicles from which the tubes are drawn . Provided the area per lipid remains constant during the process , this implies a con - stant surface tension in each of the phases . The interface between the two phases is described by a jump in the values of the bending rigidities (cid:11) i and (cid:11) (cid:1) i (cid:2) G and in the surface tension (cid:12) i , and by a positive line tension (cid:16) at the interface @ (cid:8) . The last term in the free energy is the work performed by the external force f needed to pull the tube . We neglect the small effect of pressure [ 13 ] . The variational derivation of the shape equations of the surface has been detailed elsewhere [ 21 ] and yields : : : (cid:3) (cid:5) _ 3 2 (cid:5) 2 cos r (cid:12) (cid:4) 3 sin 2 r _ 2 (cid:4) 3cos 2 (cid:5) 1 2 r 2 _ (cid:5) cos 2 (cid:4) 1 2 r 3 sin (cid:4) (cid:12) (cid:11) _ (cid:4) (cid:12) (cid:11) sin r : ( 2 ) Far away from the junction , we recover homogeneous cylindrical tubes with (cid:3) (cid:21) = 2 and R i (cid:3) (cid:1) (cid:11) i = 2 (cid:12) i (cid:2) 1 = 2 . Mechanical equilibrium implies that the forces at both extremities are equal and that f (cid:3) 2 (cid:21) (cid:1) 2 (cid:12) i (cid:11) i (cid:2) 1 = 2 , which imposes that (cid:12) (cid:8) = (cid:12) (cid:10) (cid:3) (cid:11) (cid:10) = (cid:11) (cid:8) : the surface tension jumps discontinuously across the interface . The mismatch between constants such as the bend - ing rigidities appears only in the boundary conditions and strongly affects the interface shape .

Two conditions are the continuity of the radius r (cid:1) s (cid:2) and the angle (cid:1) s (cid:2) [ 19 ] ; two additional conditions stem from the variational procedure and relate the ﬁrst and the second derivatives of the angle on each side of the interface to the values of r , , (cid:11) (cid:8) , (cid:11) (cid:10) , (cid:15) (cid:11) G (cid:3) (cid:11) (cid:10)G (cid:5) (cid:11) (cid:8)G , and (cid:16) . Results . — Figure 3 illustrates the different effects that line tension and differences in elastic rigidities individu - ally have on the two - phase tube . The ﬁrst possible dis - continuity at the junction is a jump in bending rigidities [ Fig . 3 ( a ) ] . The ratio of the bending rigidities in the two phases (cid:11) (cid:3) (cid:11) (cid:10) = (cid:11) (cid:8) ﬁxes the ratio of the radii away from the junction and of the surface tensions in the two phases . Without line tension and jump in Gaussian rigidity , the radius decreases smoothly from the values of the more rigid phase to the value in the less rigid phase , but with a remarkable structural feature—a small plateau ( i . e . , a membrane region with a horizontal tangent ) occurs around the junction . This plateau is also given by an analytical linear calculation [ 22 ] . When line tension dominates [ Fig . 3 ( b ) ] , the radius at the interface decreases with increasing line tension . It vanishes for a huge line tension . Note that our description breaks down at scales comparable to the bilayer width . Despite the fact that the radius goes to zero , the mean curvature remains ﬁnite ; in the highly pinched limit , a saddle point develops at the neck which keeps the total curvature energy ﬁnite . When the discontinuity in Gaussian rigidities domi - nates [ Fig . 3 ( c ) ] , numerical evidence suggests that the neck radius does not decrease all the way down to zero . Moreover , stability arguments given below impose a bound on the maximum absolute value of (cid:15) (cid:11) G . How - ever , the presence of the neck favors the breaking process . In this case , ﬁssion does not occur exactly at the interface but at the neck . One thus expects to ﬁnd , after ﬁssion , a small patch of one phase still attached to the other phase . Since details at the length scale of the neck itself cannot be resolved experimentally , this effect might be relevant to determine the dominant ﬁssion mechanism . Discussion . — For general experimental conditions , all three effects are superimposed at the junction . A quanti - tative analysis of the shape in order to extract the vari - ous parameters is then difﬁcult , especially as little to nothing is experimentally known about the precise shape of the junction . Typical values of the bending rigidity of liquid bilayers are around 25 k B T , and the rigidity of the liquid - ordered phases can be up to sev - eral times higher . Recently , the bending modulus of a heterogeneous vesicle has been obtained by comparing the experimental shape to numerical solutions of the shape equations [ 23 ] . The Gaussian rigidity (cid:11) (cid:1) i (cid:2) G is noto - riously difﬁcult to measure experimentally , but a recent study cites values of (cid:11) (cid:1) i (cid:2) G (cid:3) (cid:5) 0 : 83 (cid:11) i [ 24 ] . Stability argu - ments impose that (cid:5) 2 (cid:11) i < (cid:11) (cid:1) i (cid:2) G < 0 . The equilibrium free energy of the tube can be calcu - lated from Eq . ( 1 ) and allows for a discussion of the stability of the tube and of its ﬁssion . We show in Fig . 4 the free energy of a tube as a function of the dimension - less radius at the neck r neck = R 0 in the speciﬁc case of (cid:11) (cid:8) (cid:3) (cid:11) (cid:10) and (cid:11) (cid:8)G (cid:3) (cid:11) (cid:10)G . This energy is maximal for a vanishing radius : at this point , the membrane is maxi - mally bent . Fission of the tube by pinching requires one to cross this energy barrier . The free energy of the ruptured tube is also shown on the ﬁgure . It is lower than the top of the barrier by the contribution of the Gaussian curvature due to the change in topology upon rupture , which equals 4 (cid:21)(cid:11) G . Notice that the bending energy does not change upon rupture : at vanishing radii , the neck is a saddle point with vanishing mean curvature [ 22 ] . The ruptured tube corresponds to a transient shape since , in the absence of an applied force , the tubes retract to form two spheres . In the absence of line tension the tube is uniform r (cid:1) z (cid:2) (cid:3) R 0 and its energy is zero , and a homogenous tube is thus thermodynamically stable only if the free energy of the - 10 - 5 0 5 10 15 Z 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 r κ = 1 . 25 κ = 1 . 5 κ = 1 . 75 κ = 2 . 0 - 10 - 5 0 5 10 Z 0 0 . 5 1 r σ = 0 . 5 σ = 1 . 0 σ = 2 . 0 σ = 4 . 0 - 10 - 5 0 5 10 Z 0 0 . 5 1 r ∆κ = −1 . 0 ∆κ = 1 . 0 ∆κ = 2 . 0 ∆κ = 4 . 0 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) FIG . 3 ( color online ) .

Numerically , we have deter - mined this stability limit as (cid:11) G > (cid:5) 1 : 29 (cid:11) . The values of the parameters then ﬁx the value of r neck = R 0 . We have also evaluated the energy barrier against ﬁssion by pinching from this macroscopic model . Note , however , that this is only a lower bound to the real energy barrier , as it ignores effects at the molecular length scale which certainly is attained when the neck becomes very thin . To compare our results to the experi - ments , we have computed the various energies at the fol - lowing ( measured or realistic ) parameter values .

If we assume that ﬁssion is a thermally activated process [ 25 ] , the average time until ﬁssion t b occurs is t b (cid:3) t 0 exp E gap = k B T . Using a hydro - dynamic argument , we estimate the basic time scale as t 0 (cid:3) (cid:30)R 3 (cid:8) = (cid:11) (cid:8) , where (cid:30) is the viscosity of water . For the parameter values cited above , this yields a time scale t 0 (cid:7) 1 : 44 (cid:6) 10 (cid:5) 4 s . We thus expect the experimental time until ﬁssion to be approximately 350 ms . This is in good agreement with the experimentally observed typical time for ﬁssion , which is of order 1 s . Conclusion . — We have studied the behavior of a multi - phase membrane tube using thermodynamic arguments . The shape of the junction between two domains depends on three quantities : the line tension of the interface and the jumps in the two elastic constants . While experimen - tal precision is not yet at a level where these results can be compared directly to our calculated tube shapes , we have also considered the breaking time of a two - phase tube . Our modeling , based on an energetic approach , predicts a strong dependence of the ﬁssion dynamics on the elastic properties of the phases and yields results that are in good agreement with the experimental data .
