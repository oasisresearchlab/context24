Introduction The multivesicular body ( MVB ) pathway , cytokinesis , and viral budding use the endosomal sorting complexes required for trans - port ( ESCRTs ) for topologically equivalent membrane fission re - actions ( Henne et al . , 2011 ; Schmidt and Teis , 2012 ) . MVBs are spherical endosomes that consist of a limiting membrane and in - traluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) that transport membrane proteins des - tined for degradation into lysosomes ( Gruenberg and Stenmark , 2004 ) . Five ESCRT complexes are required for the formation of ILVs and the loading of ubiquitinated membranes proteins ( cargo ) into growing ILVs ( Raiborg and Stenmark , 2009 ) . The sequential action of ESCRT - 0 , - I , and - II together with the or - dered assembly of ESCRT - III links membrane invagination to cargo sorting . Membrane scission in the neck of the growing ves - icle releases mature , cargo - laden ILVs into the lumen . In vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that the assembly of the ESCRT - III complex is directly involved in membrane remodeling and scission ( Falguières et al . , 2008 ; Saksena et al . , 2009 ; Wollert et al . , 2009 ) . The mechanisms underlying this ESCRT - mediated membrane budding are not understood . The ESCRT - III com - plex consists of four closely related core subunits , Vps20 / Chmp6 , Snf7 / Chmp4 , Vps24 / Chmp3 , and Vps2 / Chmp2 ( Babst et al . , 2002a ) , that share a common molecular architecture ( Muzioł et al . , 2006 ) . In the cytoplasm , their C termini fold back onto their core domains to maintain an autoinhibited conformation ( Bajorek et al . , 2009 ; Xiao et al . , 2009 ) . On membranes , the displacement of the C terminus triggers ESCRT - III assembly ( Zamborlini et al . , 2006 ) . On endosomes , the ESCRT - II complex controls the ordered as - sembly of a ringlike ESCRT - III filament with a defined diameter of  65 nm ( Babst et al . , 2002b ; Teis et al . , 2010 ; Henne et al . , 2012 ) . Direct binding of the first ESCRT - III subunit Vps20 to the ESCRT - II subunit Vps25 converts Vps20 into the active nucleator F ive endosomal sorting complexes required for trans - port ( ESCRTs ) mediate the degradation of ubiqui - tinated membrane proteins via multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) in lysosomes . ESCRT - 0 , - I , and – II interact with cargo on endosomes . ESCRT - II also initiates the assembly of a ringlike ESCRT - III filament consisting of Vps20 , Snf7 , Vps24 , and Vps2 . The AAA – adenosine triphosphatase Vps4 disassembles and recycles the ESCRT - III complex , thereby terminating the ESCRT pathway . A mechanistic role for Vps4 in intraluminal vesicle ( ILV ) formation has been unclear . By combining yeast genetics , biochemistry , and electron tomography , we find that ESCRT - III assem - bly on endosomes is required to induce or stabilize the necks of growing MVB ILVs . Yet , ESCRT - III alone is not sufficient to complete ILV biogenesis . Rather , binding of Vps4 to ESCRT - III , coordinated by interactions with Vps2 and Snf7 , is coupled to membrane neck constriction dur - ing ILV formation . Thus , Vps4 not only recycles ESCRT - III subunits but also cooperates with ESCRT - III to drive dis - tinct membrane - remodeling steps , which lead to efficient membrane scission at the end of ILV biogenesis in vivo .

These mu - tations in Snf7 , Vps24 , and Vps2 did not affect the expression levels of the mutant proteins but caused them to migrate faster on an SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 1 B ) . To test how individual MIMs con - tribute to the binding of Vps4 to the ESCRT - III complex , we replaced the endogenous Vps4 with a functional Vps4 - HA that was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of the MIM mutants . Mutations in the MIMs of Vps20 ( vps20 * ) and Vps24 ( vps24 * ) did not affect the binding of Vps4 - HA to ESCRT - III subunits ( Fig . S1 A ) . In the Vps2 MIM1 mutant ( vps2 * ) , the interaction of Vps4 with all ESCRT - III subunits was reduced ( Fig . 1 C , lane 4 ) . To assess these binding defects more quantitatively , we used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC ) together with mass spectrometry . Vps4 - HA was precipitated from wild - type ( WT ) cells ( grown with heavy [ 13 C 6 / 15 N 2 ] l - lysine ) and from vps2 * mutants . Immunoprecipitates were mixed and sub - jected to SDS - PAGE ( Fig . S1 B ) . Bands containing the Vps4 and ESCRT - III complex were excised , proteolytically digested , and analyzed by mass spectrometry . MaxQuant - based quantification showed that equal amounts of Vps4 - HA were isolated from WT and vps2 * mutant cells ( Fig . 1 D , heavy / light ratio = 1 . 1 ; Tables S1 and S2 ) . Vps4 - HA from WT cells recovered ≥10 times more Vps24 , Vps2 , and the accessory ESCRT - III subunit Did2 when compared with vps2 * mutants ( Fig . 1 D , heavy / light ratio > 10 ; Tables S1 and S2 ) . Only heavy peptides from Snf7 and Vps20 were detected , indicating that they were only recovered from WT cells ( Fig . 1 D ) . Mutations in the MIM2 of Snf7 ( snf7 * ) moder - ately reduced the binding of Vps4 - HA to the mutant Snf7 * pro - tein ( Fig . 1 C , lane 3 ) . Unexpectedly , also less Vps24 and Vps2 was recovered from snf7 * mutants ( Fig . 1 C , lane 3 ) , indicating that the MIM2 of Snf7 helps to stabilize transient interactions of Vps4 with the ESCRT - III complex . To address how Snf7 and Vps2 contribute to the interaction of Vps4 with the membrane - associated ESCRT - III complex , we used the substrate trap mutant Vps4 - E233Q . Vps4 - E233Q cannot hydrolyze ATP and hence constitutively interacts with the assembled ESCRT - III complex on endosomes of WT cells as shown by subcellular fractionation ( Fig . 1 E , lane 1 ) . Similarly , in snf7 * mutants , the majority of Vps4 - E233Q was membrane associated ( Fig . 1 E , lane 3 ) . In vps2 * mutants , slightly more Vps4 - E233Q was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction ( Fig . 1 E , lane 6 ) . In snf7 * , vps2 * dou - ble mutants , the majority of Vps4 - E233Q failed to stably associ - ate with ESCRT - III on membranes ( Fig . 1 E , lane 8 ) , indicating that Vps2 and Snf7 together mediate stable binding of Vps4 to the ESCRT - III complex . Consistently , in snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants , Vps4 - E233Q - HA failed to detectably coimmunopre - cipitate ESCRT - III subunits ( Fig . 1 F , lane 4 ) . Immunoprecipi - tation of Vps4 - E233Q - HA from snf7 * mutants recovered only slightly less Snf7 * protein ( Fig . 1 F , lane 2 ) . Yet , in the vps2 * mutant , the interaction of Vps4 - E233Q - HA with all ESCRT - III subunits was reduced ( Fig . 1 F , lane 3 ) . Corresponding mutations in the MIT domain of Vps4 that interfere with binding to ei - ther the MIM2 ( I18D ) or MIM1 ( L64D ) yielded similar results ( Fig . S1 C ) . Collectively , these findings confirm that the inter - action of Vps4 with the MIM1 of Vps2 is mainly responsible for the binding to ESCRT - III . In addition , we now show that for ESCRT - III assembly ( Im et al . , 2009 ; Teis et al . , 2010 ) . Vps20 then nucleates the homooligomerization of Snf7 , which consti - tutes the major ESCRT - III subunit . ESCRT - III assembly is com - pleted by binding of Vps24 and Vps2 ( Teis et al . , 2008 ) , which also transforms ESCRT - III into spiral filaments ( Henne et al . , 2012 ) . Vps2 is central for the recruitment of Vps4 , which is sup - ported by the ESCRT - III – associated protein Did2 ( Babst et al . , 2002a ; Nickerson et al . , 2006 ) . With two other ESCRT - III – associated proteins , Ist1 and Vps60 , they promote the assembly of the active Vps4 complex ( Davies et al . , 2010 ; Shestakova et al . , 2010 ) . The active Vps4 complex consists of one or two stacked hexameric rings and the cofactor Vta1 , which enhances the ATPase activity and supports interactions with ESCRT - III ( Azmi et al . , 2006 ; Landsberg et al . , 2009 ; Monroe et al . , 2014 ) . The in - teraction of Vps4 with ESCRT - III subunits requires its N - terminal microtubule interacting and trafficking ( MIT ) domain . The MIT domain consists of three antiparallel helices ( Scott et al . , 2005 ) that interact with the acidic C - terminal MIT - interacting motifs ( MIMs ) of the ESCRT - III subunits . One side of the MIT domain ( helices  2 /  3 ) binds to the helical MIM1 of Vps2 and Did2 and the MIM1 - like element of Vps24 ( Fig . 1 A ; Obita et al . , 2007 ; Stuchell - Brereton et al . , 2007 ) . The opposite side of the MIT domain ( helices  1 /  3 ) binds to the unstructured MIM2 on Vps20 and Snf7 ( Fig . 1 A ; Kieffer et al . , 2008 ) . This setup en - ables the Vps4 complex to interact with multiple MIMs exposed by fully assembled ESCRT - III , which probably enhances Vps4 activity and initiates ESCRT - III disassembly . Thereby , Vps4 re - cycles individual ESCRT - III subunits back to the cytoplasm , which is essential for continuous MVB sorting ( Babst et al . , 1997 , 1998 ) . In vitro , the ordered assembly of the ESCRT - III complex on giant unilamellar vesicles was sufficient for membrane scis - sion ( Wollert et al . , 2009 ; Wollert and Hurley , 2010 ) , suggesting that Vps4 has a minor if any role in membrane remodeling and only functions to recycle ESCRT - III . In vivo , Vps4 localized to HIV budding sites , before virus release ( Baumgärtel et al . , 2011 ; Jouvenet et al . , 2011 ) , and regulators of Vps4 activity influenced the size of ILVs ( Nickerson et al . , 2010 ) . However , a direct func - tion for Vps4 - mediated ESCRT - III disassembly in membrane re - modeling was not defined . Here , we provide evidence that the function of Vps4 in yeast extends beyond mere ESCRT - III recy - cling . We show that the coordinated binding of Vps4 to the ESCRT - III subunits Snf7 and Vps2 is essential for efficient mem - brane remodeling and neck constriction during ILV formation . Results Binding of Vps4 to the ESCRT - III complex is mainly mediated by Snf7 and Vps2 To understand how Vps4 functions together with ESCRT - III , we used structural information on the MIT – MIM interface to manipulate the interaction of Vps4 with the ESCRT - III complex in vivo . Therefore , we mutated specific sites in the MIMs of all ESCRT - III core subunits that have been implicated in binding to the MIT domain of Vps4 ( Fig . 1 A ; Obita et al . , 2007 ; Kieffer et al . , 2008 ; Shestakova et al . , 2010 ) . Using homologous recombina - tion , each ESCRT - III subunit was replaced with its corresponding MIM mutant , yielding four different yeast strains : vps20 - L188D 35 Vps4 and ESCRT required for membrane neck constriction • Adell et al .

The interaction of Vps4 with Snf7 and Vps2 is essential for efficient ESCRT - III disassembly and MVB sorting We next addressed how the binding of Vps4 to the MIM2 of Snf7 and the MIM1 of Vps2 would affect ESCRT - III disas - sembly using velocity sedimentation centrifugation on 10 – 40 % glycerol gradients . We have previously shown that membrane - associated ESCRT - III assembles into a transient higher mo - lecular weight complex of 17 . 6 S , corresponding to  450 kD ( Fig . 2 A ; Teis et al . , 2008 ) . In WT cells , the majority of Snf7 was detected in low molecular weight fractions on top of the gradient . Very little of membrane - bound Snf7 was detected in the high molecular weight fraction , consistent with the transient nature of the ESCRT - III complex ( Fig . 2 A ) . In snf7 * single mutants and vps2 * single mutants , the majority of membrane - associated Snf7 was detected in low molecular weight fractions , similar to WT cells . Yet , slightly more Snf7 was found in the high molecular weight fraction at  17 . 6 S ( Fig . 2 A ) . In the snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants , the majority of membrane - associated Snf7 was detected in a high molecular weight complex at  17 . 6 S ; little Snf7 was present in low molecular weight frac - tions ( Fig . 2 A ) . The size of the assembled complex was similar in all strains , suggesting that the MIM mutations did not affect ordered assembly of the ESCRT - III complex but rather com - promised its disassembly and recycling , particularly in snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants . Subcellular fractionation revealed that in WT cells , but also in snf7 * single mutants and in vps20 * , vps24 * double mutants , the majority of ESCRT - III was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction ( Fig . 2 B ) . In vps2 * mutants , the subcel - lular distribution of Snf7 and Vps24 was not evidently affected , but more Vps2 * protein was detected in the membrane fraction , suggesting incomplete ESCRT - III disassembly ( Fig . 2 B , lanes 7 and 8 ) . In the snf7 * , vps2 * double mutant , all ESCRT - III sub - units accumulated on membranes ( Fig . 2 B , lane 11 ) . Yet , a small fraction of Snf7 * protein , Vps24 , and Vps2 * protein was consistently detected in the cytoplasmic fraction ( Fig . 2 B , lane 12 ) . In vps4  mutants , ESCRT - III disassembly is completely blocked ; all ESCRT - III subunits accumulate on membranes and are efficiently depleted from the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2 B , lanes 3 and 4 ) . These results indicated that the reduced binding of Vps4 to the ESCRT - III complex in snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants caused inefficient ESCRT - III disassembly . To assess the disassembly kinetics , we used a semi – in vitro disassembly assay ( Davies et al . , 2010 ) . Addition of recombinant , purified Vps4 and ATP to membrane fractions isolated from vps4  mutants resulted in release of Snf7 from membranes into the supernatant ( Fig . 2 C ) . Within 30 s , 100 nM Vps4 efficiently released ≥50 % of Snf7 from WT membranes ( Fig . 2 C , lanes 3 and 4 ) . Mutations in the individual MIMs of Snf7 and Vps2 caused slightly slower re - lease of Snf7 from the membrane fraction into the soluble frac - tion , particularly after 30 s ( Fig . 2 C , lanes 3 – 6 ) . Vps4 - I18D or Vps4 - L64D at 200 nM failed to release Snf7 from membranes ( Fig . S1 D ) . High concentrations of Vps4 - I18D ( 1 µM ) rescued the release of Snf7 from membranes . This was not the case for Vps4 - L64D , as reported previously ( Fig . S1 D ; Davies et al . , 2010 ) . Very little , if any , Snf7 * was released from membranes isolated from snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants in vitro ( Fig . 2 C , lanes 3 – 6 ) . Overall , these experiments suggest that individual MIM mutations cause modest delays in ESCRT - III disassem - bly . Simultaneous mutations of the MIMs in Snf7 and Vps2 resulted in very slow and inefficient ESCRT - III disassembly in vivo and in vitro . To systematically address how ESCRT - III disassembly contributes to MVB sorting , we monitored the transport of GFP - tagged carboxypeptidase S ( CPS ) into the vacuole of all possible MIM mutant combinations ( Fig . 2 , D and E ) . None of the indi - vidual MIM mutants blocked the delivery of GFP - CPS into the vacuole ( Fig . 2 , D and E ) . vps20 * and vps24 * single mutants or vps20 * , vps24 * double mutants did not show detectable MVB - sorting defects ( Fig . 2 , D and E ; and not depicted ) . The transport of GFP - CPS to the lumen of the vacuole was indistinguishable from WT cells ( Fig . 2 , D and E ) . Even the deletion of the entire MIM1 - like element of Vps24 ( 1 – 209 ) did not affect GFP - CPS sorting to the vacuole ( Fig . S1 E ) . Mutation of the MIM2 in Snf7 caused a minor defect in MVB sorting . In snf7 * mutants , the ma - jority of GFP - CPS was transported to the vacuolar lumen , but a small fraction of GFP - CPS was missorted to the limiting vacuo - lar membrane and / or accumulated in vesicles around the vacuole ( Fig . 2 D ) . vps2 * mutants displayed a more distinct MVB - sorting defect . A significant fraction of GPF - CPS reached the vacuolar lumen but also accumulated on the limiting membrane of the vacuole ( Fig . 2 D ) . Neither vps20 * , snf7 * , vps24 * nor vps20 * , vps24 * , vps2 * triple mutants augmented the MVB - sorting de - fects of the respective single mutant ( Fig . 2 E and Fig . S1 E ) . Of all possible combinations , only snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants dis - played a strong synthetic sorting defect ; very little GFP - CPS , if any , reached the lumen of the vacuole ( Fig . 2 , D and E ) . The ma - jority of GFP - CPS now accumulated on perivacuolar class E – like compartments , phenotypically similar to vps4  mutants . To as - sess the MVB - sorting defects of the MIM mutants more quanti - tatively , we used the luciferase reporter of intraluminal deposition ( LUCID ) assay ( Nickerson et al . , 2012 ) . The cytoplasmic tail of the integral membrane protein Sna3 is fused to Firefly luciferase ( FLuc ) , which is degraded via the MVB pathway . Therefore , the luciferase reporter activity is low in WT cells and approximately JCB • VOLUME 205 • NUMBER 1 • 2014 38 Snf7 - MIM1 was detected in a high molecular weight complex at  17 . 6 S ( Fig . S2 B ) . It seems that the chimeric ESCRT - III sub - units assemble into membrane - bound complexes that are similar to WT – ESCRT - III complexes . To probe the binding of Vps4 to the chimeric ESCRT - III complexes in vivo , we used immunoprecipitation . Vps4 - HA recovered similar amounts of Snf7 , Snf7 - MIM1 , and Snf7 - MIM1 * , suggesting that ESCRT - III interactions are primarily driven by binding to Vps2 ( Fig . 3 C , lanes 1 – 3 ) . However , in vps2 * mutants , the Snf7 - MIM1 chimera could restore the interaction with Vps4 ( Fig . 3 C , lane 5 ) , whereas the Snf7 - MIM1 * chimera could not ( Fig . 3 C , lane 6 ) . Interestingly , Snf7 - MIM1 also rescued the interaction of Vps4 with Vps24 but not with Vps2 * ( Fig . 3 C , lane 5 ) . Deletion of the entire MIM1 from Vps2 ( 1 – 214 ) reduced the interaction of Vps4 - E233Q with ESCRT - III ( Fig . 3 D , lane 2 ) , similar to the Vps2 * mutation ( Fig . 1 F , lane 3 ) . Again , the Vps2 - MIM2 chimera could not restore the interaction of Vps4 - E233Q with ESCRT - III ( Fig . 3 D , lane 4 ) . However , once a functional MIM1 was displayed on the ESCRT - III complex , presented either by Snf7 - MIM1 or by Vps2 - MIM2 - MIM1 , Vps4 - E233Q binding to the ESCRT - III complex was restored ( Fig . 3 D , lanes 3 , 5 , and 6 ) . The interaction of Vps4 - E233Q to Vps2 ( 1 – 214 ) or Vps2 - MIM2 always remained low ( Fig . 3 D , lanes 3 and 5 ) . Thus , the efficient interaction of Vps4 with the ESCRT - III complex requires at least one MIM1 of Vps2 and the MIM2 of Snf7 regardless of their respective positions within the as - sembled ESCRT - III complex . It seems that chimeric ESCRT - III subunits assemble into an ESCRT - III complex in which the interactions with Vps4 are rearranged . The MIMs of Vps2 and Snf7 couple ESCRT - III disassembly to ILV biogenesis Next we tested whether these rearranged Vps4 – ESCRT - III interactions would support ESCRT - III disassembly and MVB sorting using subcellular fractionation and live - cell fluorescence microscopy . Expression of SNF7 , snf7 - MIM1 , or snf7 - MIM1 * complemented the MVB - sorting defect in snf7  mutants ( Odorizzi et al . , 1998 ) . GFP - CPS was transported to the lumen of the vacuole indistinguishable from WT cells ( Fig . 4 , A [ sec - tions 1 and 2 ] and C ) . Hence , Snf7 - MIM1 and Snf7 - MIM1 * are functional subunits that did not affect ESCRT - III assembly ( Fig . S2 , A and B ) or disassembly in vivo . Similar results were obtained for Vps20 - MIM1 ( Fig . S3 B ) . As expected from the inter - action experiments , replacing the MIM1 of Vps2 with the MIM2 ( vps2 - MIM2 ) displayed GFP - CPS – sorting defects similar to the vps2 * or the vps2 ( 1 – 214 ) MIM1 deletion mutant ( Fig . 4 A , sec - tion 3 ; and Fig . S3 C , sections 1 and 2 ) . Yet , the Vps2 - MIM2 - MIM1 chimera fully restored ESCRT - III disassembly and MVB sorting ( Fig . 4 A , section 6 ) . Snf7 - MIM1 , which restored the interaction of Vps4 with ESCRT - III in a vps2 * background , was also able to mediate complete ESCRT - III dissociation from membranes in a vps2 * mutant , indistinguishable from WT cells ( Fig . 4 A , section 4 ) . All ESCRT - III proteins , including the mu - tant Vps2 * , were released from endosomes ( Fig . 4 A , compare subcellular distribution of Vps2 * in sections 3 and 4 ) . Veloc - ity sedimentation centrifugation showed that little Snf7 - MIM1 fivefold increased in vps4  mutants ( Fig . 2 F ) . The luciferase ac - tivity of vps20 * , vps24 * double mutants was hardly increased when compared with WT cells ( Fig . 2 F ) . snf7 * mutants had a 1 . 7 - fold higher luciferase activity , and vps2 * mutants displayed twofold higher luciferase activity when compared with WT cells , consistent with partial MVB - sorting defects . snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants showed an approximately fivefold increase in luciferase activity , similar to vps4  mutants ( Fig . 2 F ) . Finally , only snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants display a synthetic growth defect at a high temperature , similar to vps4  mutants ( Fig . 2 G ) . These results demonstrate that the binding of Vps4 to the MIM1 of Vps2 and the MIM2 of Snf7 is essential for efficient ESCRT - III disassem - bly and MVB sorting . Rearranging the binding of Vps4 to the ESCRT - III complex Since the MIM2 of Snf7 and the MIM1 of Vps2 are displayed on different positions in the assembled ESCRT - III complex ( Fig . 3 A ) , we asked whether the MIM2 and the MIM1 provide spatial in - formation required for efficient Vps4 – ESCRT - III interaction and function . We changed the positions of the MIMs by generating chimeric ESCRT - III proteins . The MIM1 ( aa 214 – 232 ) of Vps2 was fused with a short linker to Vps20 ( Vps20 - MIM1 ) , the first and least abundant ESCRT - III protein , and to Snf7 ( Snf7 - MIM1 ) , the major ESCRT - III subunit ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . To ensure that the properties of these chimeras are specifically mediated by the MIM1 and not caused by a defective protein folding , we gener - ated Snf7 chimeras ( Snf7 - MIM1 * ) with an inactive MIM1 ( L228D , K229D ) . The MIM1 of Vps2 ( the last subunit that is added to the ESCRT - III complex ) was replaced with the MIM2 of Snf7 ( aa 197 – 210 ) , yielding the chimera Vps2 - MIM2 . As a control , we fused the original MIM1 ( aa 214 – 232 ) back onto the C terminus of Vps2 - MIM2 , yielding the Vps2 - MIM2 - MIM1 chimera ( Fig . 3 B ) . To characterize these ESCRT - III chimeras in vitro , GST alone or GST - tagged chimeras were immobilized on beads and incubated with recombinant Vps4 - E233Q and ATP . Vps4 - E223Q bound weakly to GST - Snf7 and stronger to GST - Vps2 ( Fig . 3 B , lanes 2 and 5 ) but not to GST alone ( Fig . 3 B , lane 1 ) . The GST - Snf7 - MIM1 chimera , but not the GST - Snf7 - MIM1 * chimera , bound to Vps4 - E233Q comparable to GST - Vps2 ( Fig . 3 B , lanes 3 and 4 ) . Replacing the MIM1 of Vps2 with the MIM2 of Snf7 ( GST - Vps2 - MIM2 ) reduced the binding of Vps4 - E233Q , suggesting that the MIM2 of Snf7 could not replace the MIM1 ( Fig . 3 B , lane 6 ) . Readdition of the MIM1 to the Vps2 - MIM2 chimera restored the strong binding of Vps4 - E233Q in vitro ( Fig . 3 B , lane 7 ) . In vitro , Vps4 exhibited higher affinity for the MIM1 of Vps2 when compared with the MIM2 of Snf7 . Next , we analyzed whether Snf7 - MIM1 assembled into chimeric ESCRT - III complexes on endosomes . In vps4  mutants , the chimeric ESCRT - III complexes accumulated on endosomes ( Fig . S2 A , lanes 7 – 12 ) . Velocity sedimentation centrifugation on 10 – 40 % glycerol gradients showed that the majority of the Snf7 - MIM1 was detected in low molecular weight fractions on top of the gradient . Very little of membrane - bound Snf7 - MIM1 was detected in the high molecular weight fraction , consistent with the transient nature of the chimeric ESCRT - III complex ( Fig . S2 B ) .

Although Snf7 - MIM1 restored binding of Vps4 and ESCRT - III disassembly , was detected at high molecular weight at  17 . 6 S , similar to WT cells ( Fig . S2 B ) . In contrast , Snf7 - MIM1 * did not restore full ESCRT - III release . Vps2 * was still found on the membrane ( Fig . 4 A , section 5 ) , and slightly more Snf7 - MIM1 * was found Figure 3 .

Fluorescence microscopy already indicated a severe MVB - sorting defect in snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants , suggesting the formation of class E compartments . The ultrastructural analysis of the snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants revealed a distinct phenotype . In the majority of cells , MVBs with few but large ILVs with a mean di - ameter of 41 nm ( n = 157 ; SD = ±16 nm ) were detected , corre - sponding to a threefold increase in ILV membrane surface ( Fig . 5 , A and B ; and Video 4 ) . The mean number of ILV / MVB was dra - matically reduced to three ( n = 15 fully reconstructed MVBs ; SD = ±1 ; Fig . 5 C ) . Interestingly , large ILV budding profiles were frequently observed . In some cells , class E – like structures with ILV budding profiles and few but large ILVs were observed . The phenotype of the snf7 * , vps2 * double mutant was independent of Vps21 overexpression ( Fig . S4 , A and B ) . To address whether the MVB phenotype of the snf7 * , vps2 * mutant was caused by a general block in the ESCRT - III recycling or driven by slow but continuous ESCRT - III disas - sembly , we applied a temperature - sensitive ( ts ) vps4 - ts mutant . ESCRT - III disassembly and MVB morphology are not affected in vps4 - ts mutants that grow at the permissive temperature ( 26°C ; Babst et al . , 1998 ; Russell et al . , 2012 ) . Blocking vps4 - ts func - tion at the nonpermissive temperature ( 37°C ) efficiently de - pleted cytoplasmic ESCRT - III in WT cells and snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants ( Fig . 6 A , lanes 1 – 3 ) and blocked ILV biogenesis . Class E compartments devoid of ILVs formed in WT cells and snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants ( Fig . 6 C and Fig . S5 A ) . Then , the same cells were shifted back to the permissive temperature ( 26°C ) to restore the function of vps4 - ts . Cycloheximide was added 15 min before this temperature shift to block protein syn - thesis ( Fig . 6 B ) . Thereby , the recovery of ILV biogenesis became entirely dependent on the recycling of the available ESCRT - III pool in WT cells and snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants . In WT cells , but not in vps4  mutants , ESCRT - III recycling ( Fig . 6 , lanes 4 and 7 ) and MVB sorting were efficiently re - stored ( Fig . S5 A ) . Despite a block in protein synthesis , snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants restored ESCRT - III recycling and ILV biogenesis , to the extent observed before vps4 - ts was inacti - vated ; a small but consistent pool of Snf7 * was again detected in the cytoplasmic fraction ( Fig . 6 A , lanes 6 and 9 ) , fewer ILVs / MVB were formed ( three ILVs / MVB , SD = ±2 ; n = 15 fully re - constructed MVBs ) , and the ILVs were larger ( mean diameter = 39 nm , SD = ±16 nm ; n = 116 ; Fig . 6 C ) . Other ESCRT complexes were also not trapped in snf7 * , vps2 * mutants but still recycled slowly ( Fig . S5 , B and C ) . In snf7 * , vps2 * mutants , Vps23 - GFP was detected on class E com - partments but also on peripheral endosomes and in the cytoplasm , similar to WT cells . In vps4  mutants , Vps23 - GFP localized al - most exclusively to class E compartments and was depleted from the cytoplasm ( Fig . S5 , B and C ) . Overall , this analysis showed that mutations affecting the coordinated binding of Vps4 to ESCRT - III and subsequent disassembly / remodeling directly in - fluence ILV biogenesis in vivo . Binding of Vps4 to Snf7 and Vps2 is required for ILV neck constriction To better understand which step of ILV biogenesis requires the binding of Vps4 to ESCRT - III , we carefully analyzed the budding it failed to rescue the partial MVB - sorting defect in vps2 * mutants . Instead , Snf7 - MIM1 aggravated the vps2 * phenotype , causing the accumulation of GFP - CPS in class E – like compart - ments ( Fig . 4 A , section 4 ) . Transmission EM of cryofixed cells demonstrated that ILV biogenesis was completely blocked . In snf7 - MIM1 , vps2 * mutants , class E compartments formed de - spite ongoing ESCRT - III assembly and disassembly ( Fig . 4 B ) . Chimeric ESCRT - III containing Vps2 - MIM2 and Snf7 - MIM1 was still partially disassembled by Vps4 , but MVB sorting was abrogated ( Fig . 4 A , section 7 ) . These data suggested that the function of Vps4 is not restricted to ESCRT - III recycling . Other - wise , all ESCRT - III chimeras that restore Vps4 binding and ESCRT - III disassembly should still form ILVs . Rather , it seems that the coordinated interaction of Vps4 with Snf7 and Vps2 couples ESCRT - III disassembly to ILV biogenesis . Probably , Vps4 binding to the ESCRT complex and subsequent ESCRT - III disassembly has a more direct role in ILV formation than origi - nally anticipated . Vps4 - mediated ESCRT - III disassembly controls ILV biogenesis in vivo To investigate how the binding of Vps4 to Snf7 and Vps2 contrib - utes to ILV biogenesis in vivo , we used electron tomographic re - constructions and modeling of cryofixed samples ( Fig . 5 , A and B ; and Videos 1 – 4 ) . Since MVBs are not very abundant in yeast , we overexpressed the Rab5 homologue Vps21 to enrich and clus - ter MVBs ( Markgraf et al . , 2009 ) . Vps21 overexpression did not affect the size and the morphology of ILVs . The mean ILV di - ameter of WT cells was 24 nm ( n = 414 ; SD = ±4 nm ; Fig . 5 , A and B ; and Video 1 ) , consistent with the previously reported size of ILVs in yeast ranging around 25 nm ( Nickerson et al . , 2006 , 2010 ; Wemmer et al . , 2011 ) . Similar results were obtained when we measured the diameter of ILVs that accumulated in the lumen of vacuoles of v - ATPase – deficient ( vma4  ) mutants ( Fig . S4 , E and F ) . On average , we detected 69 ILVs / MBV in 11 fully reconstructed MVBs ( n = 11 ; SD = ±32 ; Fig . 5 C ) . In snf7 * mutants , the diameter of ILVs was less uniform and slightly larger when compared with WT cells ( Fig . 5 , A and B ; and Video 2 ) . The mean ILV diameter in snf7 * mutants was 29 nm ( n = 441 ; SD = ±7 nm ) , representing a 20 % increase in diameter and a 45 % increase in ILV membrane surface . The total number of ILV / MVB decreased to 45 ILVs / MVB ( n = 13 fully reconstructed MVBs ; SD = ±20 ; Fig . 5 C ) . The defects in ILV biogenesis in the MVBs of vps2 * mutants were slightly more pronounced ( Fig . 5 , A and B ; and Video 3 ) . In addition , we detected in  25 % of vps2 * mutants “failing” MVB structures , which contained few , if any , ILVs in the lumen of deformed membrane cisternae , remi - niscent of class E compartments . The mean diameter of ILVs in the vps2 * mutant was 30 nm ( n = 512 ; SD = ±8 nm ) , similar to snf7 * mutants . The number of ILVs / MVB was further reduced to 25 ILVs / MVB ( n = 10 fully reconstructed MVBs ; SD = ±14 ; Fig . 5 C ) . Vps4 - I18D caused again a slightly stronger defect ( Fig . S4 D ) . The mean diameter of ILVs was 30 nm ( n = 379 ; SD = ±7 nm ) , but the number of ILVs / MVB was further reduced to 10 ILVs / MVB ( n = 10 fully reconstructed MVBs ; SD = ±4 ; Fig . 5 , B and C ) . Vps4 - L64D blocked ILV biogenesis and caused the formation of bona fide class E compartments ( Fig . S4 C ) . JCB • VOLUME 205 • NUMBER 1 • 2014 42 previous observations ( Wemmer et al . , 2011 ) .

In WT cells ( 37 bud necks on 31 MVBs ) and snf7 * , vps2 * mutants ( 37 necks on 30 MVBs ) , one ILV bud neck per MVB was de - tected on average . ILV neck diameters of 40 – 50 nm are remark - ably consistent with the inner diameter of the ESCRT - III ring induced by ESCRT - II in vitro ( Henne et al . , 2012 ) . In snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants , ESCRT - III assembled into a more stable high molecular weight complex , in size corre - sponding to the more transient ESCRT - III complex in WT cells ( Fig . 2 A ) . Maybe the wider bud necks were caused by inefficient ESCRT - III disassembly , suggesting that Vps4 and ESCRT - III would function together in neck constriction . Alternatively , ESCRT - I and ESCRT - II together may already have induced these invaginations ( Wollert et al . , 2009 ; Wollert and Hurley , 2010 ) . Yet , in the snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants , these membrane necks cannot undergo scission because new ESCRT - III complexes can - not properly assemble as a result of inefficient ESCRT - III recy - cling . To directly address whether ESCRT - III assembly is required to induce or stabilize ILV necks in a snf7 * , vps2 * double mutant , we used a single point mutation ( T150K ) in the ESCRT - II subunit Vps25 . Vps25 binds specifically to helix  1 of Vps20 and thereby converts Vps20 into the active nucleator for ESCRT - III assembly . The T150K mutation in Vps25 specifically prevents the inter - action of Vps20 with ESCRT - II , and hence , ESCRT - III no lon - ger assembles ( Im et al . , 2009 ; Teis et al . , 2010 ) . Subcellular fractionation demonstrated that mutant ESCRT - II complexes ( vps25T150K ) reduced the accumulation of ESCRT - III in the membrane fraction of snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants ( Fig . 7 E , lanes 3 and 5 ) . Hence , in snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants , ESCRT - III assembly followed the canonical ESCRT - II – dependent pathway . Electron tomography showed that ESCRT - II – dependent assem - bly of the ESCRT - III complex was essential to induce or stabi - lize ILV bud necks . In a majority of snf7 * , vps2 * double mutants , MVBs with large ILV bud necks and few , but large , ILVs were detected ( Fig . 7 F ) . However , when ESCRT - III no longer efficiently assembled in ESCRT - II ( vps25 - T150K ) mutants , bona fide empty class E compartments , devoid of ILV budding profiles and ILVs , were observed in the vast majority of cells ( Fig . 7 F and Video 5 ) . These findings strongly suggested that ESCRT - II – mediated as - sembly of the ESCRT - III complex is required to induce or sta - bilize ILV budding structures / necks in vivo . Yet , ESCRT - III assembly remains insufficient to complete ILV budding . It fol - lows that efficient budding requires the coordinated binding of Vps4 to Snf7 and Vps2 in the assembled ESCRT - III complex . Thereby , the Vps4 - dependent ESCRT - III disassembly reaction plays a key role in ILV biogenesis , most likely by inducing con - formation changes in ESCRT - III that drive membrane deforma - tion and bud neck constriction , which ultimately lead to membrane scission in vivo ( Fig . 8 ) . Discussion ESCRT - III and Vps4 are essential for all ESCRT - mediated bud - ding reactions , and it is clear that Vps4 is required to disassemble ESCRT - III from membranes and recycle its individual subunits back into the cytoplasm ( Adell and Teis , 2011 ) . However , the role of Vps4 in ILV biogenesis was not clear . We propose here that the coordinated binding of Vps4 to Snf7 and Vps2 directly couples ESCRT - III disassembly to membrane neck constriction during MVB biogenesis ( Fig . 8 ) . The binding of Vps4 to the fully assembled ESCRT - III complex is mainly mediated by the MIM1 of Vps2 and a recruitment complex consisting of Did2 and Ist1 ( Shestakova et al . , 2010 ) . The interaction of Vps4 with the MIM2 of Snf7 further stabilizes Vps4 on ESCRT - III . Binding of Vps4 to Snf7 and Vps2 could result in maximal occupancy of its MIT domains , which also stimulates the ATPase activity ( Azmi et al . , 2008 ; Merrill and Hanson , 2010 ; Shestakova et al . , 2013 ) . In yeast , Vta1 and Doa4 also have MIT ( or MIT - like ) domains and participate in the ESCRT pathway . The MIT of Vta1 binds to the MIMs in Did2 and Vps60 ( Azmi et al . , 2008 ) . The MIT - like Figure 8 . Proposed model for ILV biogenesis . PI ( 3 ) P , phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate . JCB • VOLUME 205 • NUMBER 1 • 2014 46 et al . , 2012 ) . Maybe Vps4 together with ESCRT - III constitutes a mechanochemical membrane - remodeling machinery , in some ways similar to FtsZ rings or dynamin . FtsZ and dynamin are large multidomain GTPases that power several nucleotide - driven conformational states required for membrane scission ( Osawa et al . , 2008 ; Faelber et al . , 2011 ; Shnyrova et al . , 2013 ) . The binding of Vps4 may trigger first conformational changes in ESCRT - III and then disassembly or both , but we strongly believe that they are all mechanistically linked . The characterization of these processes as well as their precise function in membrane remodeling will require new experimental approaches . Based on published data and our results presented here , we propose the following model for the cooperation of Vps4 and ESCRT - III during ILV biogenesis ( Fig . 8 ) . ESCRT - 0 , - I , and – II bind and cluster ubiquitinated cargo and may already induce ini - tial membrane deformation . ESCRT - II , most likely bound to ubiq - uitinated cargo , induces the ordered assembly of the ESCRT - III complex into a ringlike filament with a diameter of  40 – 60 nm , which not only encircles MVB cargo but also defines the mem - brane that will be remodeled into an ILV ( Teis et al . , 2010 ; Henne et al . , 2012 ) . Once complex assembly is complete , ESCRT - III either induces or stabilizes an  40 – 60 - nm neck of the growing ILV , probably supported by an N - terminal insertion motif that anchors the ESCRT - III filament to membranes ( Buchkovich et al . , 2013 ) . The coordinated binding of Vps4 to the ESCRT - III com - plex mediates productive ESCRT - III remodeling / disassembly that induces conformational changes to convert the ESCRT - III ring into a helical spiral , which then somehow drives membrane neck constriction . Maybe Vps4 converts a relaxed ESCRT - III spiral in the neck into a constricted state and thereby transmit forces to membranes for further remodeling steps . In contrast , the interaction of Vps4 with the chimeric ESCRT - III complex may result in a destructive ESCRT - III remodeling / disassembly reac - tion , causing the rapid collapse of the budding intermediates . Alternatively , the coordinated binding of Vps4 to ESCRT - III may already function during the initial stages of membrane invagina - tion as well as later during bud neck constriction , implying that Vps4 and ESCRT - III could function together in multiple steps during ILV biogenesis . The majority of ILV necks appeared to constrict close to the limiting membrane of MVBs , suggesting that the relatively large Vps4 complex ( diameter  14 nm ; Yu et al . , 2008 ; Hartmann et al . , 2008 ; Landsberg et al . , 2009 ) may have access to the ac - tual site of the final membrane scission step . Only in very few instances , long and narrow bud necks , which would exclude Vps4 , were observed . In addition , the binding of Bro1 to Snf7 may negatively regulate Vps4 – ESCRT - III – driven membrane scission activity to allow Doa4 - dependent cargo deubiquitination before membrane scission ( Wemmer et al . , 2011 ) . Given the multiple ESCRT - III isoforms in mammals , the coordinated action of Vps4 and ESCRT - III may be more complex . Still , because of the evo - lutionary conservation of the ESCRT - III subunits and Vps4 , membrane remodeling in higher eukaryotes could follow similar concepts . Overall , our work demonstrates for the first time that the coordinated binding of Vps4 to the ESCRT - III complex is re - quired for efficient membrane remodeling and neck constriction during MVB vesicle formation in vivo . domain of Doa4 binds to Vps20 ( Richter et al . , 2013 ) . Our results imply that the major function of the MIM1 of Vps2 and the MIM2 of Snf7 is to coordinate the binding of Vps4 to the ESCRT - III complex . However , there are no general rules that define the in - teraction of MITs with MIMs ( Hurley and Yang , 2008 ) . There - fore , we cannot entirely rule out that other interactions of the MIMs of Vps2 and Snf7 are independent of Vps4 but also con - tribute to the ESCRT pathway . Deletions in the C - terminal region encompassing the MIM1 of Chmp2B / Vps2 cause a rare autosomal dominant frontotem - poral dementia . Patient fibroblasts contained enlarged , deformed MVBs with few ILVs ( Urwin et al . , 2010 ) , somewhat reminis - cent to the disturbed MVB morphology that we observe in yeast MIM mutants . We did not detect a significant role for the MIM2 of Vps20 / Chmp6 or for the MIM1 - like element of Vps24 / Chmp3 in Vps4 binding to ESCRT - III , disassembly , or MVB sorting in yeast . Although it remains currently unclear how Vps4 disas - sembles the ESCRT - III complex , disassembly reactions of other AAA - ATPases with simple polymeric substrates are better char - acterized . Katanin and Spastin use their N - terminal MIT domain to interact with the acidic C terminus of (  /  ) tubulin on micro - tubules and exert mechanical tugs sufficient to cause microtubule catastrophe ( Roll - Mecak and Vale , 2008 ) . The type VI secretion system of gram - negative bacteria requires the AAA - ATPase , ClpV , to disassemble large tubules of cogwheel - like VipA / VipB polymers ( Bönemann et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , ClpV only in - teracts with VipB , and its removal is sufficient to drive the col - lapse of the VipA / VipB tubule ( Pietrosiuk et al . , 2011 ) . Often , it seems to be sufficient for AAA - ATPases to extrude key subunits to disassemble or collapse polymeric substrates . Similarly , Vps4 could extract key ESCRT - III subunits to induce a catastrophic breakdown of the entire filament or processively disintegrate the ESCRT - III complex . Hence , we speculate that the coordi - nated binding of Vps4 to Vps2 and Snf7 induces disassembly and / or may promote conformational changes in the architecture of the ESCRT - III complex , which in turn drive membrane neck constriction and scission . Recent publications support the idea that the architecture of ESCRT - III is flexible and can be remod - eled . In vivo and in vitro findings suggest that ESCRT - III pro - teins can assemble in differently sized rings , spirals , tubes , and domes ( Ghazi - Tabatabai et al . , 2008 ; Lata et al . , 2008 ; Bajorek et al . , 2009 ; Guizetti et al . , 2011 ; Effantin et al . , 2013 ) . When ESCRT - III is bound to ESCRT - II , it assembles into a ring with a defined outer diameter of  60 nm , which can convert into spiral filaments ( Henne et al . , 2012 ) . In vitro , Vps4 binding to Vps24 - Vps2 chimeras induces ESCRT - III filament bundling ( Ghazi - Tabatabai et al . , 2008 ) . In vivo , ATP hydrolysis - deficient Vps4B - E235Q converts plasma membrane – associated spiral filaments consisting of hSnf7 / Chmp4 or hVps2 / Chmp2B into tubes projecting out of cells ( Hanson et al . , 2008 ; Bodon et al . , 2011 ) . At some point during ESCRT - III remodeling , Chmp2 / 3 may form a domelike structure that could promote membrane scission ( Lata et al . , 2008 ; Fabrikant et al . , 2009 ) . During cytoki - nesis , long ESCRT - III – dependent 17 - nm filaments spiral toward the site of membrane abscission to promote cortical constriction ( Guizetti et al . , 2011 ) . Vps4 - induced remodeling / breakage of these ESCRT - III filaments occurs before final abscission ( Elia 47 Vps4 and ESCRT required for membrane neck constriction • Adell et al .

Tomograms were reconstructed and modeled using IMOD software ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) . For ILV size and ILV membrane neck analysis , single slices of reconstructed tomograms were analyzed using 3dmod . For morphometry , we analyzed > 30 MVBs , > 150 ILVs , and > 33 ILV budding profiles per cell type in 2D slices from tomo - graphic reconstructions from seven different WT cells , four different snf7 * , five different vps2 * , and nine different snf7 * , vps2 * mutants . Dual - luciferase reporter assay ( LUCID ) Dual - luciferase assays of Sna3 - FLuc trafficking to the lysosome were per - formed as previously described ( Nickerson et al . , 2012 ) . In brief , lucifer - ase activity of Sna3 - FLuc and Renilla luciferase ( RLuc ) was analyzed with the dual - luciferase assay system ( DLR ; Promega ) . Cells in mid – log phase ( OD = 0 . 6 ) were treated with cycloheximide ( 50 µg / ml final ) for 30 min , harvested by centrifugation , and lysed by incubation in 500 µl lysis buffer by vortexing with glass beads at RT . 5 - µl aliquots of the lysate were ana - lyzed in 96 - well plate format using a luminometer ( TriStar LB941 ; Berthold Technologies ) . After background subtraction , luciferase activity of Sna3 - FLuc was normalized to the activity of RLuc . Block and recovery of MVB biogenesis in vps4 - ts mutants Yeast cells were grown to logarithmic phase at 26°C and then shifted to 37°C for 4 h . 50 µg / ml cycloheximide was added to the growth media 15 min before shifting them back to 26°C for 4 h . 30 OD 0 . 6 equivalents grown at 37°C or recovering at 26°C ( with cycloheximide ) were subjected to subcellular fractionation , cryofixation , and electron tomography as de - scribed in this work , except that cells grown at 37°C were also sphero - blasted at 37°C . SILAC and mass spectrometry analysis vps2 * mutants were grown in SILAC “light” medium , and WT cells were grown in SILAC “heavy” medium containing ( 13 C 6 / 15 N 2 ) l - lysine ( 20 µg / ml ; Sigma - Aldrich ) for 10 generations to mid – log phase ( OD 600 = 0 . 6 ) . Cells were washed once with ice - cold double - distilled H 2 O and used for immuno - precipitation . Immunoprecipitated proteins from WT cells ( labeled with heavy lysine ) and from vps2 * mutants were eluted in SDS sample buffer ( without bromophenol blue ) , mixed , and subjected to SDS - PAGE . Proteins were digested in gel with LysC . Peptides were analyzed using an HPLC sys - tem ( UltiMate 3000 Nano - LC ; Dionex ) coupled to a mass spectrometer ( LTQ Orbitrap XL ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . MaxQuant version 1 . 2 . 0 . 18 with search engine Andromeda and Proteome Discoverer version 1 . 2 . 0 . 208 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) with search engine Mascot version 2 . 2 . 07 ( Matrix Science ) were used for data analysis . Raw data obtained by liquid chroma - tography – electrophoresis electrospray ionization – mass spectrometry were searched against the yeast protein database downloaded from http : / / downloads . yeastgenome . org / sequence / S288C _ reference / orf _ protein / . Materials and methods Antibodies and reagents Rabbit polyclonal antisera against Vps2 were produced by immunizing rabbits ( Eurogentec ) . 1 mg H6 - Vps2 , purified from Escherichia coli , was excised from SDS - PAGE and used for immunization . The antiserum ( serum agglutination test 455  ) was purified using GST - Vps2 transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane , eluted with 100 mM glycine , pH 2 . 5 , and diluted 1 : 100 for Western blotting . The specificity of the antibody was tested using recombinant proteins and yeast extracts from vps2  mutants . Monoclonal anti - HA affinity agarose was obtained from Sigma - Aldrich . The mouse monoclonal anti - HA antibody ( 12CA5 ) was a gift from L . Hengst ( Biocenter , Innsbruck Medical University , Innsbruck , Austria ) . Rabbit poly - clonal antisera against Vps4 , Snf7 , and Vps24 were a gift from S . D . Emr ( Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology , Cornell University , Ithaca , NY ) and have been previously described ( Babst et al . , 1998 ) . Anti - PGK ( phosphoglycerate kinase 1 ) mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Invitrogen . Cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . Strains , plasmids , and DNA manipulation Information on Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains , plasmids , and oligo - nucleotides is provided in Tables S3 , S4 , and S5 . Protein expression and purification Purification of recombinant proteins was performed as previously de - scribed ( Babst et al . , 1998 ; Teis et al . , 2008 ) . Recombinant proteins were expressed in E . Coli C41 ( DE3 ) pLysS ( Lucigen ) . GST - tagged proteins were purified with glutathione – Sepharose 4B ( GE Healthcare ) , washed , and either eluted with glutathione or cleaved with thrombin . H6 - tagged pro - teins were purified with Ni – nitrilotriacetic acid agarose , washed , and eluted with imidazole . H6 - Vps2 was directly eluted with SDS sample buf - fer ( 2 % SDS , 0 . 1 M Tris , pH 6 . 8 , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 01 % bromophenol blue , and 5 %  - mercaptoethanol ) . GST pull - down assay using GST – ESCRT - III GST pull - down assays were performed as previously described ( Shestakova et al . , 2010 ) . GST – ESCRT - III subunits were bound to glutathione – Sepharose 4B ( GE Healthcare ) , washed , and incubated with Vps4 - E233Q and 1 mM ATP for 10 min at RT . Bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS - PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Immunoprecipitation experiments 30 OD 600 equivalents of the yeast cells grown to mid – log phase ( OD = 0 . 6 ) were lysed by bead beating in immunoprecipitation buffer ( 100 mM KAc , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 % NP - 40 , and 100 mM NaCl ) . Solubilized proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 2 h at 4°C with 30 µl anti - HA agarose . Beads were washed four times in immunoprecipitation buffer . Bound pro - teins were eluted with SDS sample buffer . Subcellular fractionation assays Subcellular fractionation of proteins into membrane - associated pellets and soluble cytoplasmic fractions was performed as previously described ( Babst et al . , 1997 ) . 30 OD 600 equivalents of the yeast cells grown to mid – log phase ( OD = 0 . 6 ) were spheroblasted and homogenized by douncing . After a clearing spin ( 500 g for 5 min ) , supernatants were centrifuged ( 15 , 000 g for 10 min ) to separate heavy membranes from cytosol . Semi – in vitro ESCRT - III disassembly assay ESCRT - III disassembly assays were performed as previously described ( Davies et al . , 2010 ) . 100 OD 600 equivalents of the yeast cells grown to mid – log phase ( OD = 0 . 6 ) were spheroblasted and homogenized by douncing in chilled lysis buffer ( 0 . 2 M sorbitol , 50 mM KOAc , 2 mM EDTA , 20 mM Hepes , pH 6 . 8 , and protease inhibitors ) . After a clearing spin ( 500 g for 5 min ) , supernatants were centrifuged ( 15 , 000 g for 10 min ) to separate heavy membranes from cytosol . The membrane pellet was washed in 1 ml ATPase reaction buffer ( 100 mM KOAc , 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , and 5 mM MgOAc ) with 1 mM sorbitol and protease inhibitors ( buffer A ) . The repelleted membranes were resuspended in buffer A and passed through an 18 - gauge needle three times and a 30 - gauge needle five times for homogenization . Homogenized membranes were stored at  80°C . 100 - µl reactions containing 2 OD 600 equivalent membranes , 100 nM purified Vps4 , and an ATP regen - eration system ( 10 mM phosphocreatine , 20 U / ml creatine phosphokinase , and 0 . 8 mM ATP ) were incubated at 26°C for 30 and 60 s . The disassembly re - action was stopped by centrifugation , and membrane - bound and - released proteins were separated by centrifugation at 13 , 000 rpm at 4°C .
