Estes 1 , 4 Globally , most cases of gastroenteritis are caused by pandemic GII . 4 human norovirus ( HuNoV ) strains with no approved therapies or vaccines available . The cellular pathways that these strains exploit for cell entry and internaliza - tion are unknown . Here , using nontransformed human jejunal enteroids ( HIEs ) that recapitulate the physiology of the gastrointestinal tract , we show that infectious GII . 4 virions and virus - like particles are endocytosed using a unique combination of endosomal acidi ﬁ cation - dependent clathrin - independent carriers ( CLIC ) , acid sphingomyelinase ( ASM ) - mediated lysosomal exocytosis , and membrane wound repair pathways . We found that besides the known interaction of the viral capsid Protruding ( P ) domain with host glycans , the Shell ( S ) domain interacts with both galectin - 3 ( gal - 3 ) and apoptosis - linked gene 2 - interacting protein X ( ALIX ) , to orchestrate GII . 4 cell entry . Recognition of the viral and cellular determinants regulating HuNoV entry provides insight into the infection process of a non - enveloped virus highlighting unique pathways and targets for developing effective therapeutics . Human noroviruses ( HuNoVs ) , non - enveloped , single - stranded , positive - sense RNA viruses , are classi ﬁ ed into at least ten genogroups ( GI - GX ) and 48 genotypes and belong to the family Caliciviridae . HuNoVs are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide 1 , posing a signi ﬁ cant risk to global health . Speci ﬁ c treatments and vac - cines are lacking , partly due to the extended time before a reliable and tractable culture system became available to cultivate HuNoV , which limited understanding of norovirus pathophysiology , drivers of host - virus interactions , and systemsto testapproaches to controlinfection . A breakthrough came when nontransformed human intestinal enteroids ( HIEs ) were proven to be a reproducible and biologically relevant system that supports the replication of multiple HuNoV strains 2 , 3 . HIEs have been successfully applied to ( 1 ) identify HuNoV strain - speci ﬁ c growth requirements 2 , 4 – 6 , ( 2 ) identify neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and improve understanding of host responses to HuNoV for vaccine development 7 – 10 , and ( 3 ) monitor the environ - mental HuNoV load and the ef ﬁ cacy of disinfection strategies 11 , 12 . HIEs recapitulate the cellular complexity , diversity , and physiology of the human gastrointestinal tract along with host restriction and genetic factors and mimic strain - speci ﬁ c epidemiological host - virus infection patterns , making them an ideal system to dissect HuNoV infection and pathophysiology 13 . Virusentryintothecellisthe ﬁ rststepininfection .

Although virus - cellsurfaceinteractionsare complex and highly variable , the number of pathways utilized by viruses for cell entry is relatively limited based on certain key surface components .

Our studies show that GII . 4 HuNoV binding to epi - thelial cells induces plasma membrane wounding that triggers cellular components to the injury site for membrane repair . Surprisingly , we foundtheviruscapsidinteractswiththeendosomalsortingcomplexes requiredforthetransport ( ESCRT ) proteinALIXandinduceslysosomal exocytosis along with other membrane repair mechanisms . GII . 4 HuNoV enters HIEs using a speci ﬁ c mechanism driven by endosomal acidi ﬁ cation and requires effectors of the CLIC pathway [ cholesterol , Cdc42 , ADP - ribosylation factor 1 ( Arf1 ) , and galectin - 3 ( gal - 3 ) ] . These studies demonstrate an active CLIC pathway in HIEs , with a crosstalk between CLIC - mediated endocytosis and host repair mechanisms highlighting these pathways as targets for interfering with pathogen entry in human intestinal cells . Results GII . 4 entry in jejunal HIEs requires endosomal acidi ﬁ cation to initiate endocytosis To probe HuNoV entry into a permissive , secretor positive jejunal ( J2 ) HIE line , we used virus - like particles ( VLPs ) from pandemic GII . 4 Syd - ney / 2012 ( GII . 4 Syd VLPs ) and GII . 4 Sydney / 2012 virus . We ﬁ rst validatedVLPsasasurrogateforvirusinthesestudiesbyshowingGII . 4 Syd VLPs inhibited virus replication of a GII . 4 stool isolate in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 1a ) . Several HuNoV strains are dependent on intestinal components such as bile acid ( BA ) and ceramide for cell entry and replication 6 . GII . 4 infection is enhanced by , but does not require , bile or BA for replication 2 , while initiation of endosomal acidi ﬁ cation with BAglycochenodeoxycholic acid ( GCDCA ) is required for GII . 3 infection 6 . To understand if endosomal acidi ﬁ cation is a requirement for GII . 4 entry , HIEs were inoculated with GII . 4 virus , and acidic compartments were labeled with LysoTracker . In GII . 4 - inocu - latedcells , asigni ﬁ cantincreaseinLysoTracker - positiveorganelleswas seen , which was signi ﬁ cantly reduced in the presence of neutralizing GII . 4 - speci ﬁ c polyclonal antibody ( pAb ) , indicating that acidic orga - nelles are induced in response to virus - cell interactions ( Fig . 1b ) . Endosomal acidi ﬁ cation studies showed that GII . 4 Syd VLPs , like virus , induced endosomal acidi ﬁ cation that was not observed with GII . 3 VLPs , indicating strain - speci ﬁ c differences in the ability to trigger endocytosis ( Fig . 1c ) . Moreover , GII . 4 infection in the presence of ba ﬁ lomycin A1 , a vacuolar ATPase ( V - ATPase ) inhibitor , reduced the number of GII . 4 - induced acidic compartments ( Fig . S1a ) , completely inhibiting GII . 4 replication in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 1d ) .

S1b , upper right panel ) . This was due to the presence of membrane - bound VLPs , which after ba ﬁ lomycin A1 removal , activated endocytosis reversing inhibition of V - ATPase ( Fig . S1b , lower right panel ) . GII . 4 - induced endocytosis was con ﬁ rmed using FM1 - 43FX epi - ﬂ uorescence and time lapse microscopy ( Fig . 1e , f ) . FM1 - 43FX labels extracellular membranes and ﬂ uorescent puncta are observed fol - lowing endocytosis . An upregulation of FM1 - 43FX - labeled compart - ments was observed in GII . 4 VLP - treated cells further con ﬁ rming that unlikeGII . 3 ( whichrequiresBA ) , theGII . 4Sydcapsidaloneiscapableof triggering endocytosis upon interaction with the host cells ( Fig . 1e ) . Endocytosis experiments in the presence of ba ﬁ lomycin A1 indicated that GII . 4 endocytosis is V - ATPase dependent ( Fig . S1c ) and required the intact VLP as the glycan - binding P domain alone did not trigger endocytosis ( Fig . S1d ) . FM1 - 43FX labeling experiments in the presence ofadditionalVLPsshowedthatfourGII . 4variants [ HoustonVirus / 2002 ( HOV ) , New Orleans / 2009 ( NO ) , Grimsby / 1995 ( GRV ) , Farmington Hills / 2002 ( FH ) ] induced endocytosis while HuNoV strains thatrequire BA ( GII . 3 , GI . 1 and GII . 17 ) did not induce endocytosis , further sup - porting the use of different cell entry mechanisms between BA - dependent and independent HuNoV strains ( Fig . S1d ) . GII . 4 uses a dynamin - independent pathway that requires mem - brane cholesterol and is in ﬂ uenced by actin GII . 4 entry was explored further by using speci ﬁ c inhibitors of membrane components known to be involved in endocytic path - ways ( Fig . 2a ) . Dynamin , important for both clathrin - and caveolin - mediated endocytosis , was ﬁ rst tested considering the entry of murine norovirus ( MNV ) in RAW264 . 7 macrophages is dynamin - dependent 14 . Inhibition of dynamin with speci ﬁ c inhibitors , dynasore and mitmab , did not alter GII . 4 infection , showing that clathrin - and caveolin - mediated endocytosis pathways are not involved in GII . 4 cell entry ( Fig . 2b ) . The ef ﬁ cacy of dynasore and mitmab in HIEs was con ﬁ rmed using a ﬂ uorescently labeled , low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) - uptake assay , where both inhibitors reduced LDL uptake ( Fig . 2c ) at the tested concentrations ( 40 and 100 µ M ) . We next targeted cholesterol , another abundant plasma mem - brane component implicated in the entry and replication of many viruses , including GII . 3 HuNoV 6 , 14 – 18 . Cholesterol depletion in HIEs , by inhibitors methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) and ﬁ lipin , reduced GII . 4 infection signi ﬁ cantly ( Fig . 2d , Table S1 ) . In addition , a lower level of inhibition in GII . 4 replication with U18666A , an intracellular choles - terol transport inhibitor , was observed ( Fig . S2a ) compared to M β CD and ﬁ lipin . The activity of U18666A in HIEs was con ﬁ rmed using ﬁ lipin and CD63 staining , indicating defective intracellular cholesterol f Untreated MßCD ( 1mM ) Filipin ( 4μg / ml ) 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 G e no m e e qu i va l e n t s / w e ll 1 h 24h d * * * * P = < 0 . 0001 * * * * P = < 0 . 0001 Untreated CytoD ( 2 . 5μM ) CytoD ( 5μM ) 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 G e no m i ce qu i va l e n t s / w e ll 1h24h 20 µm Untreated Mitmab ( 100 μM ) Dynasore ( 40 μM ) Dil - LDL a b h c e g T ubu li n Untreated Dynasore ( 40 μM ) Mitmab ( 100 μM ) 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 G e no m e e qu i va l e n t s / w e ll 1h 24h Untreated Noco ( 5μM ) Noco ( 20μM ) 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 G e no m e e qu i va l e n t s / w e ll 1 h 24h Untreated Genistein ( 40μM ) Genistein ( 80μM ) 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 G e no m e e qu i va l e n t s / w e ll 1h24h * * * * P = < 0 . 0001 * * * * P = < 0 . 0001 U n t r ea t e d D y n as o r e ( 40 μ M ) M i t m a b ( 100 μ M ) 0 50 100 150 M ea nF l uo r esce n se i n t e n s i t y P = < 0 . 0001 * * * * P = < 0 . 0001 * * * * Nocodazole ( 20 µM ) Media Genistein ( 80 µM ) 10 µm Fig . 2 | GII . 4 entry is dynamin - independent but depends on cholesterol and actinforinfection . a Schematicofmajorendocytosispathways , keyregulatorsand their inhibitors . b GII . 4 replication ( at 37 o C ) was assessed in the presence of dynamininhibitors , dynasoreandmitmab .

Altogether , these results show that cholesterol is critical for GII . 4 replication . We next evaluated GII . 4 entry dependence on cytoskeletal com - ponentsusinginhibitorsagainstactin , receptortyrosinekinases ( RTK ) , and microtubules . Cytochalasin D , an actin - depolymerizing agent , reduced GII . 4 replication signi ﬁ cantly ( 53 % ) ( Fig . 2e ) , whereas genis - tein ( RTK and caveolin inhibitor ) and nocodazole ( microtubule inhi - bitor ) had no effect on GII . 4 replication ( Fig . 2f , g ) . Tubulin staining con ﬁ rmed the activities of genistein and nocodazole in HIEs ( Fig . 2h ) , suggesting that actin , but not microtubule or RTKs , is essential for GII . 4 entry . GII . 4 depends on the CLIC pathway for cell entry Inhibition of GII . 4 entry by cytochalasin D showed that viral entry was in ﬂ uenced by actin manipulation , but this drug was cytotoxic above the concentrations tested . This led us to examine other regulators of actinmechanicsthatin ﬂ uenceclathrin - independentendocytosis ( CIE ) . Aftercon ﬁ rmingthat theconcentrationofinhibitorsusedinassaysdid not induce cytotoxicity ( Table S1 ) , we tested macropinocytosis and CLICendocytosis ( Fig . 3a ) , twomajorCIEpathways , focusingonCdc42 [ EIPA , ML141 , wiskostatin ( Wisko ) ] , Rac1 [ NSC23766 ( NSC ) ] , and RhoA ( CT04 ) . Inhibition of Cdc42 ( EIPA , ML141 , and Wisko ) dramatically reduced GII . 4 replication ( 86 – 90 % ) ( Figs . 3b and S3a ) , whereas inhi - biting Rac1 or RhoA had no effect on GII . 4 replication . Other inhibitors of classical macropinocytosis such as smooth muscle myosin II inhi - bitor [ blebbistatin ( Bleb ) ] and PI3K inhibitor [ LY29402 ( LY ) ] , known to ef ﬁ ciently block the entry of vaccinia virus 19 , human adenovirus type 3 20 , and respiratory syncytial virus 21 , were also tested along with inhi - bitors of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ( CAS879127 - 07 - 8 ) andproteinkinaseC ( PKC ) ( calphostin ) . NoneoftheseinhibitorsofCIE had any effect on GII . 4 replication ( Figs . 3b and S3b ) , emphasizing that GII . 4 entry is via a Cdc42 - speci ﬁ c mechanism distinct from a classical macropinocytosis pathway . The ef ﬁ cacy of inhibitors in HIEs was con ﬁ rmed by actin staining , which detected morphological changes in treated cells ( Fig . S3c ) . Next , we evaluated GII . 4 infection in the pre - sence of an Arf1 inhibitor , Golgicide A ( GCA ) , and found that GCA signi ﬁ cantly inhibited GII . 4 replication ( 65 – 75 % ) at 24 h ( Fig . 3c ) . Taken together , the inhibitor data suggest that GII . 4 entry relies on cholesterol , Cdc42 and Arf1 , indicating a CLIC - mediated virus entry pathway . However , inhibitors can have many off - target effects , so we used a multipronged approach by evaluating the morphology of CLIC carriers , assessing GII . 4 association with gal - 3 ( a regulator of the CLIC pathway ) 22 and testing GII . 4 colocalization with known markers of the CLIC pathway . Fluorescence microscopy showed that GII . 4 induces tubularstructureformationreminiscentofCLICcarriersinVLP - treated cellswith variable lengths ( 200nm – 2 µ m ) ( Fig . 3d ) , which were further con ﬁ rmedbyelectron microscopy ( EM ) ( Fig . 3e ) .

Next , GII . 4association with gal - 3wasassessed using ﬂ uorescence microscopy , gal - 3 inhibition assays , and direct binding respectively ( Figs . 3f , S3e , S3f , 3g , 3h , and 3i ) . We found that GII . 4 colocalizes with gal - 3 ( Fig . 3f ) in a time - dependent manner . In the presence of TD - 139 , a speci ﬁ c gal - 3 inhibitor , both GII . 4 colocalization and endocytosis is rapidly ( 10 min ) inhibited suggesting the impor - tance of gal - 3 in GII . 4 entry into cells ( Figs . S3e and S3f ) . Gal - 3 is a multifunctional protein involved in many cellular processes and is foundinboththebiotinylatedsurfaceprotein ( BSP ) plasmamembrane and cytosolic fractions of cells ( Fig . S3g ) . As inhibitors are unable to differentiatebetween the differentpopulationsof gal - 3 , we speci ﬁ cally used anti - gal - 3 antibody to target gal - 3 interactions on the plasma membrane . Our results showed that anti - gal - 3 antibody signi ﬁ cantly inhibited GII . 4 replication ( 98 % reduction ) , further asserting the importance of gal - 3 - GII . 4 interaction in GII . 4 entry and infection ( Fig . 3g ) . Direct binding assays showed that gal - 3 bound to VLPs ( Fig . 3h ) , and to the GII . 4 capsid S domain , but not to the P domain , of VP1 of VLPs , with micromolar af ﬁ nity ( Figs . S3h and S3i ) . Finally , we investigated GII . 4 colocalization using speci ﬁ c markers of the CLIC pathway such as cholera toxin B ( CTxB ) , CD44 and glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored protein ( GPI - AP ) . All these proteins are well studied and characterized for their usage in CLIC - mediated endocytosis 24 – 26 . Fluorescence microscopy showed that GII . 4 shared cargoes with CTxB ( Fig . 3i ) despite not having any effect on replication when recombinant CTxB was used as a competitor ( Fig . S3j ) . ThissuggeststhatalthoughGII . 4usesasimilarentrypathway as CTxB , the receptor / s used for each is distinct . GII . 4 colocalization with CD44 and GPI - AP further veri ﬁ ed that GII . 4 uses CLIC - mediated endocytosis for entry ( Figs . S3k and S3l ) . ESCRT protein ALIX is critical for GII . 4 entry ESCRTs are known regulators of endocytosis . The unexpected pre - sence of conserved ESCRT binding motifs for ALIX and TSG101 in the GII . 4 capsid sequence ( Fig . S4a ) led us to further investigate if these proteinsareinvolvedinGII . 4entry . Bindingassays ( ELISAanddot - blot ) showedthatGII . 4SydVLPsinteractwithrecombinantALIXandTSG101 ( Figs . 4a , b , S4b ) . Confocal microscopy of virus - infected HIEs showed colocalization between replicating virus , and ALIX and TSG101 at 24 h , suggesting their role in GII . 4 replication ( Fig . S4c ) . Putative ESCRT bindingsequencesarepresentinboththeGII . 4capsidSandPdomains ( Fig . S4a ) ; however , ELISAdatashowedthatwhileTSG101bindstoboth the S and P domains ( Fig . 4b ) , ALIX binding is limited to the S domain only ( Fig . 4a ) . Bio - Layer Interferometry ( BLI ) analysis con ﬁ rmed the ELISA results , demonstrating that binding af ﬁ nity of ALIX to the S domain ( K D = 9 . 92 µ M ) and TSG101 to the S domain ( K D = 21 . 5 µ M ) and the P domain ( K D = 15 . 5 µ M ) were in the micromolar range ( Fig . 4c ) . We further probed the contribution of ALIX and TSG101 in GII . 4 entry using protein - speci ﬁ c antibodies as blocking agents . While anti - ALIX pAb blocked GII . 4 replication completely in a dose - dependent manner , anti - TSG101 pAb had no effect on GII . 4 replication ( Figs . 4d and S4d ) . These data suggest that ALIX is accessible to GII . 4 VLPs on the membrane surface , which was further con ﬁ rmed by Western blot detection of ALIX in the biotinylated surface protein ( BSP ) fraction of HIEswithananti - ALIXpAb ( Fig .

Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 36398 - z Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 1148 5 a direct link between GII . 4 and ALIX as HIEs incubated with VLPs ( 10 min or 1h ) showed GII . 4 colocalization with ALIX at both time points , withmoreVLP - ALIXcolocalizationobservedat1hcomparedto 10min ( Fig . 4e ) . Notably , media - treated control cells exhibited no signi ﬁ cant cell surface ALIX staining compared to VLP - treated cells , implying that GII . 4 binding induced ALIX recruitment to the cell sur - face ( Fig . 4e ) . Both ELISA and BLI experiments showed that ALIX binds the GII . 4 capsid S - domain , with a conserved “ LYTPL ” sequence ( Fig . S4a ) . This sequence was mutated ( Δ ) to “ AATAL ” and this Δ S - domain was expressed and puri ﬁ ed from E . coli . ELISA showed that the Δ S - domain does not bind ALIX , thus , con ﬁ rming the ALIX binding site ( Fig . 4f ) . To further understand the role of ALIX in entry , an ALIX mutant VLP ( Δ VLP ) was generated by substituting the “ LYTPL ” sequence with “ AATAL ” in GII . 4 Syd VLP . After con ﬁ rming that the ALIX mutation did not interfere with VLP formation ( Fig . S4f ) , GII . 4 Syd VLP and Δ VLP were analyzed using both endocytosis and viral inhibition assays . Both assays showed that the Δ VLP was identical to GII . 4 Syd VLP in terms of inducing endocytosis and the ability to block GII . 4 viral replication ( Figs . 4g and 4h ) , which led us to reassess Δ VLP binding to ALIX . Binding assays showed that although Δ VLP ( unlike the Δ S - domain ) boundtoALIX , thebindingwasreducedcomparedtotheGII . 4SydVLP ( Figs . S4g and S4h ) . Thissuggests that , like TSG101 , there maybe more thanoneALIXbindingsitepresentontheviralcapsidinadditiontothe site present in the S - domain . To study the role of ALIX in GII . 4 infection , attempts were made to generate a J2ALIXknock - out HIE but were unsuccessful because the KO cultures did not survive . This led us to generate J2 ALIX knock - down ( J2 ALIX - KD ) HIEs expressing an ALIX - shRNA and a TurboGFP sensor ( Fig . S4i ) . The J2 ALIX - KD cells demon - strated a signi ﬁ cant reduction in ALIX expression ( 75 % reduction ) compared to the parental J2 cultures ( Fig . S4j ) and in GII . 4 replication ( 75 % reduction ) ( Fig . 4i ) indicating an active role of ALIX in GII . 4 infection . Endolysosomal dynamics and membrane repair mechanisms regulate GII . 4 entry Endolysosomal dynamics play an important role in GII . 3 replication 6 , which led us to investigate the same for GII . 4 . This was achieved by disrupting endosomal maturation and traf ﬁ cking using YM201636 [ FYVE - type zinc ﬁ nger - containing phosphoinositide kinase ( PIKfyve ) inhibitor ] and vacuolin 1 ( PIKfyve and lysosomal exocytosis inhibitor ) , which resulted in up to 70 – 80 % reduction in GII . 4 replication com - pared to untreated cells ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Time course experiments showed the presence of inhibitors up to 1 h reduced virus yield by 40 % , whereasupto80 % inhibitioninyieldwasobservedwhentheinhibitors were present up to 2 h or 24 h , thus , suggesting the inhibitor was effective in the early stages of GII . 4 entry ( Figs . S5a and S5b ) . Inhibition of lysosomal exocytosisby vacuolin - 1 led toa reduction in GII . 4 replication , indicating that GII . 4 might require acid sphingo - myelinase ( ASM ) translocation and surface ceramides for infection like P = < 0 . 0001 * * * * G e no m e e qu i va l e n t s / w e ll P = 0 . 0090 P = 0 . 0007 * * * P = < 0 . 0001 * * * * * * a c b d e f P = 0 . 0012 * * P = < 0 . 0001 * * * * P = < 0 . 0001 * * * * C e ll s w i t h P I a nd DA P I c o - s t a i n i ng P = < 0 . 0001 * * * * P = < 0 . 0001 * * * * P ea r s on C o rr e l a t i on C o e ff i c i e n t ( P CC ) P = < 0 . 0001 * * * * P = < 0 . 0001 * * * * P = < 0 . 0001 * * * * VP1 Gal - 3 ALIX / Gal - 3 VP1 / ALIX / Gal - 3 M ed i a V L P ( 1 h ) ALIX 10 µm 10 µm VLP - treated ( 1 h ) Media VP 1 L A M P - 1 M e r ge Fig . 5 | GII . 4 entry is sensitive to factors controlling endo - lysosomal home - ostasis and induces membrane wounding and subsequent wound repair mechanisms . a GII . 4 replication in the presence of PIKfyve inhibitor YM201636 at 1h ( black ) and24h ( red ) at37 o C . b GII . 4replicationinthepresenceofvacuolin - 1 ( a lysosomalexocytosisinhibitor ) at1h ( gray ) and24h ( purple ) . c GII . 4replicationin the presence of acid sphingomyelinase ( ASM , amitriptyline ) and neutral sphingo - myelinase ( NSM , GW4869 ) inhibitors at 1h ( black ) and 24h ( blue ) . d Cell injury determination using propidium iodide ( PI ) uptake assay .

Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 36398 - z Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 1148 6 other caliciviruses 6 , 18 . Therefore , we assayed different enzymes involved in ceramide synthesis for their effect on GII . 4 replication using inhibitorsagainst ASM ( amitriptyline ) , neutral sphingomyelinase ( NSM ; GW4869 ) , and ceramide synthase [ fumonisin 1 ( FB1 ) ] . In addi - tion , we tested if addition of exogenous sphingomyelin ( SM ) , a lipid product upstream of ceramide , has any effect on GII . 4 replication . Among the inhibitors tested , amitriptyline signi ﬁ cantly inhibited GII . 4 replication ( up to 85 % ) whereas GW4869 , SM addition and FB1 , had no effect con ﬁ rming that like GII . 3 , GII . 4 requires ASM activity ( Figs . 5c , S5c and S5d ) . FB1 - treated cells had reduced CD95 expression and enhanced intracellular lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 ( LAMP - 1 ) expression compared to untreated cells , which con ﬁ rmed the activity of FB1 in HIEs ( Fig . S5e ) . Since GII . 4 does not require BA for infection , we postulated that GII . 4 - induced lysosomal exocytosis may catalyze ceramide generation as reported with feline calicivirus ( FCV ) or MNV in porcine kidney LLC - PK cells 18 . Using a ceramide - speci ﬁ c rabbit antibody 27 , we established that GII . 4 VLPs induce surface cer - amides in HIEs by confocal microscopy ( Fig . S5f ) , con ﬁ rming that ASM translocation and ceramide generation are associated with GII . 4 infection . Lastly , we examined cellular mechanisms associated with lysoso - mal exocytosis , ASM translocation and surface ceramide generation , which are known to be associated with endocytosis and wound repair mechanisms 28 . GII . 4 association with membrane wounding was inves - tigated using a propidium iodide ( PI ) uptake assay . PI uptake was sig - ni ﬁ cantly increased in the presence of GII . 4 Syd VLPs ( 10min incubation ) compared to untreated cells and GII . 4 Syd VLP - treated cells with calcium , which facilitates membrane repair by early signaling 29 ( Fig . 5d ) . GII . 4 induction of membrane wounding was associated with VLP binding to cells at 4 o C ( Fig . S5g ) and requires initial VLP interaction with cell surface histo - blood group antigens ( HBGA ) , glycans known to be essential for virus infection . Thus VLP - induced membrane wounding did not occur in isogenic HIEs in which the fucosyltransferase 2 ( FUT2 ) gene was knocked out and thus do not express secretor - dependent HBGAs on their plasma membranes 4 ( Fig . S5h ) . GII . 4 - induced membrane wounding was further con ﬁ rmed by staining the VLP - treated and untreated cells for ( 1 ) LAMP - 1 and ( 2 ) regulators of endo - lysosomal processes and wound healing mechan - isms , Rab11 and Rab14 30 , 31 . GII . 4 VP1 localized with LAMP - 1 ( Fig . 5e ) , Rab11 ( Fig . S5i ) , and Rab14 ( Fig . S5j ) , on the plasma membrane of HIEs treated with GII . 4 Syd VLPs , validating GII . 4 entry is associated with membrane wounding and healing mechanisms . Subsequently , we revisited gal - 3 and ALIX , as both are known to be coordinating factors in detecting membrane damage and repair 32 , 33 . As expected , we saw that traf ﬁ cking of both gal - 3 and ALIX to the cell surface was induced by GII . 4 Syd VLP - treatment compared to untreated cells and a high degree of colocalization was observed between gal - 3 , ALIX , and GII . 4 VP1 ( Fig . 5f ) , consistent with the fact that GII . 4 enters the cell by compromising membrane integrity . Discussion Virusesexploitmanycellularpathwaysforcellentry . Sometimessimilar effectors in ﬂ uence multiple endocytosis routes making it challenging to pinpoint a speci ﬁ c entry mechanism 34 . For example , both porcine sapovirus ( PoSaV ) and feline calicivirus ( FCV ) are endocytosed via dynamin - and cholesterol - dependent clathrin - mediated endocytosis into kidney cells 35 , 36 , whereas murine norovirus ( MNV ) is endocytosed via dynamin - and cholesterol - dependent , clathrin - and caveoli - independent endocytosis into RAW264 . 7 macrophages 14 . Since most studies of virus entry are carried out in immortalized cell lines that do not fully recapitulate the properties of the original host , characteriza - tion of virus entry into HIEs offers previously unrealized insights into intestinal biology 37 . HIEs are relevant in that they are multicellular , nontransformed , physiologically active human cultures that contain the necessary susceptibility factors for human tropic HuNoV infection . Here , we report the pandemic GII . 4 virus and VLPs initiate a pre - viously uncharacterized and complex entry process into HIEs that involves carriers of a dynamin - independent , clathrin - independent endocytosis pathway , gal - 3 , the ESCRT protein ALIX , and wound repair mechanisms ( Fig . 6 ) . To our knowledge , this viral entry process into nontransformed HIE cells was not previously described , although individual components have been associated with entry of several other viruses into a range of different cell types . VLPs were used for many of our entry studies because infectious virus cannot yet be passaged inde ﬁ nitely and current yields of virus from infected HIEs are not suf ﬁ cient to produce puri ﬁ ed particles for extensivebiochemicalstudies . Since1992 , whenHuNoVVLPswere ﬁ rst produced and characterized 38 , they have been extensively docu - mented as useful surrogates for studies of virus structure 39 – 42 , anti - genicity , immunogenicity , and glycan binding 43 – 45 . Here , we validated that VLPs are useful for studying virus entry by documenting their effectiveness as competitors of homologous virus replication . VLPs also recapitulate virus differences as VLPs of different strains exhibit differencesinvirusentry ( Fig . S1d ) . GII . 4isrecognizedtobindtoHBGA glycans through the P domain of the capsid 46 , 47 , yet surprisingly , endocytosis into HIEs was not observed with the P domain ( dimer ) alone but wasobserved only with complete VLPs ( having 180 copies of the capsid VP1 protein ) . These results indicate that the capsid shell domain participates in virus entry into cells and add evidence to the hypothesis that cells contain an entry co - receptor in addition to HBGA glycans that serve as initial binding factors for HuNoV infection . Alternatively , it could be that avidity effects , such as multiple inter - actions linked together , are important for endocytosis . We show that GII . 4 uses the CLIC pathway for entry in a HBGA glycan - dependent manner ( Fig . 6 ) . The CLIC pathway is reported to be involved in uptake of abundant surface proteins such as CD44 and glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored proteins 25 , 26 , bacterial toxins ( CTxB and Shiga ) 24 , 48 , adeno - associated virus 49 and SARS - CoV - 2 50 . Use of the CLIC pathway by GII . 4 HuNoV in nontransformed HIEs is con - sistent with the CLIC pathway being operational in vivo in mouse enterocytes 23 and tubular invaginations observed in giant unilamellar vesicles treated with GII . 4 VLPs 51 . Our study shows that gal - 3 is recruited by GII . 4 at the site of the GII . 4 - membrane interface and GII . 4 - gal - 3 interactions are necessary for infection , suggesting a putative role of gal - 3 in endocytosis . Although intracellular gal - 3 and extra - cellular gal - 3 have a myriad of functions , extracellular gal - 3 is a key player in the biogenesis of CLIC structures 22 , 23 . Gal - 3 is also known for its crosslinking abilities , organizing membrane proteins / receptors and in ﬂ uencing their function and signaling 52 . We hypothesize that , as reportedwithCD44 , monomericgal - 3interactswithGII . 4 ( boundtoits still uncharacterized receptor ) on the membrane surface leading to oligomerization ofthereceptor - GII . 4 - gal - 3 complex , and interactionof this complex with multipleglycosphingolipid head groups in the outer plasma membrane lea ﬂ et causes membrane bending due to an avidity effect 22 andsubsequentlyleadstoendocytosis . AlthoughGII . 4VLPsare shownto beintrinsicallycapable of forming tubular structures in giant unilamellar vesicles , it is unknown if the formation of such structures alone is suf ﬁ cient for endocytosis . Moreover , the GII . 4 - cell interaction causes recruitment of ALIX , an essential component of CLIC - mediated endocytosis 53 and an adaptor for several ESCRT - III subunits and phospholipids capable of regulating membrane curvature and tubular structure formation 54 – 56 , consistent with the notion that GII . 4 triggers signaling pathways that accrue an ensemble of cellular factors with membrane modulating functions for cell entry . This leads to many interesting questions such as how does GII . 4 engage gal - 3 and ALIX , what prompts their recruitment to the mem - brane surface to induce endocytosis and is there an association between gal - 3 and ALIX ? Interaction of gal - 3 and ALIX with the nor - mally inaccessible S domain of the GII . 4 capsid suggests that the GII . 4 capsid undergoes conformational changes , which can be attributed to Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 36398 - z Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 1148 7 the newly recognized plasticity of VLPs under certain conditions 42 , 57 . These conformational changes in the GII . 4 capsid may be due to its binding to the initial glycan receptor through the P domain , thus , exposing the S domain to participate in virus - host interaction . This suggests that the GII . 4 P domain interaction with the glycan receptor may be instrumental in triggering gal - 3 and ALIX recruitment to the cell surface , which is further supported by the fact that we see increased gal - 3 and ALIX recruitment with increased VLP binding . However , the GII . 4S domain interaction is still required with gal - 3 and ALIX to drive receptor oligomerization and subsequent endocytosis , which is not possible with P domain alone . To understand GII . 4 - triggered gal - 3 and ALIX translocation to the membrane , we investigated both endolysosomal traf ﬁ cking and membrane wounding mechanismsdue to the well - documented role of gal - 3 and ALIX in both processes 32 , 33 . Wounding experiments demon - strated thatGII . 4 particles directlyinducemembranewounding , which requires plasma membrane glycan expression ( Figure S5h ) and leads to lysosomal exocytosis and generation of surface ceramides ( Figs . 5e and S5f ) . These events indicate that GII . 4 exploits membrane wound - ing and subsequent repair mechanisms , similar to non - enveloped adenovirus 58 and the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi in HeLa cells 59 , for infection . Membrane wounds are repaired by reducing membrane tension , lesion removal by endocytosis , or shedding of wounded areas 28 , 29 , 60 , and compelling evidence implicate the involvement of the gal - 3 , ALIX and ESCRT proteins in membrane repair mechanisms 32 , 33 , 60 . Gal - 3 is reported to recruit ALIX in response to lysosomal damage , further promoting interaction between ALIX and the ESCRT III effector CHMP4 33 , which is known for its membrane - modulating functions . Moreover , ALIX is known to regulate epithelial cell polarity and maintain the integrity of the epithelial barrier by physically interacting with F - actin by binding the Rho family of small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 61 , responsible for actin polymerization and endocytosis . Cdc42 - induced cell polarization is regulated by membrane recycling pathways 62 , 63 ( involving Rab11 and Rab14 ) , which are critical for both wound healing and CLIC - mediated endocytosis . This indicates that GII . 4 - cell interactions trigger a series of signaling events and cross talk between cellular components activating membrane repair and recy - cling events that culminates in endocytosis . It is known that inhibiting regulators of the CLIC pathway deters membrane repair processes 64 , 65 , further validating our results on GII . 4 entry , where inhibiting ALIX , lysosomal exocytosis , and ASM translocation inhibited GII . 4 replica - tion . Although , the role of ASM or ceramide in the CLIC pathway is unclear , considering the fact that ASM mediates traf ﬁ cking of palmi - toylated proteins to the plasma membrane ( in ﬂ uencing lipid raft formation ) 66 and ceramide production leads to plasma membrane repairvia endocytosis 28 , both ASM and ASM - generated ceramide seem to be essential for GII . 4 entry and infection . Our observation that endocytosis is not observed by adding ceramide exogenously 6 , con - ﬁ rms that endocytosis requires both ASM translocation and sub - sequent conversion of membrane sphingomyelin to ceramide .

( 4 ) ASM translocation to the plasma membrane surface results in conversion of sphingomyelin ( SM ) to ceramide . ( 5 ) Ceramide formation along with other mem - brane repair processes involving gal - 3 ( glycan damage sensor ) , ALIX ( Ca 2 + sensor ) and membrane recycling processes regulated by Rab11 and Rab14 result in mem - brane reorganization and receptor clustering leading to ( 6 ) tubular carrier forma - tion due to multiple interactions of virus with host factors causing membrane bending and ( 7 ) endocytosis regulated by Cdc42 and cholesterol . ( 8 ) GII . 4 entry into the cell results in V - ATPase regulated endosomal acidi ﬁ cation causing ( 9 ) conformational changes in the virus capsid and release of the viral genome from the endosomal compartment . Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 023 - 36398 - z Nature Communications | ( 2023 ) 14 : 1148 8 af ﬁ nity for HBGAs 69 , 70 . Our data in isogenic HIEs lacking FUT2 - dependent HBGAs on the cell surface show that GII . 4 binding to suchHBGAs isnecessarytoinducemembrane wounding . We posit this triggers ceramide - mediated signaling and changes in membrane / receptor dynamics leading to gal - 3 recruitment to the interaction site and promoting cross - talk between GII . 4 and effectors of membrane repair and recycling . We postulate that recruited gal - 3 acts both as crosslinking membrane organizers and as a switch in immobilizing the ESCRT machinery followed by subsequent endocytosis and scission of CLIC structures . Although gal - 3 is a multifunctional protein strictly regulated by its ability to recognize exposed glycans , the exact mechanism of how it ﬁ ts into the cell signaling process and recruits ESCRT proteins remains unclear and requires further investigation . In this manuscript , we have shown that GII . 4 HuNoV exploits unexpected entry mechanisms to enter the cell by causing membrane wounding , triggering membrane repair mechanisms and inducing endocytosis and endosomal acidi ﬁ cation for viral infection ( Fig . 6 ) . Our data clearly highlight the strain - speci ﬁ c similarities and differences between non - pandemic , BA - dependent HuNoV strains and the pandemic , BA - independent GII . 4 HuNoV . Based on our results , we posit that the dominance of GII . 4 over other HuNoV strains may be attributed to its superior ability to exploit constitutive endocytic pathways reserved for recycling abundant surface proteins and membrane repair , in addition to its ability to overcome the host innate response 5 . Other highly pathogenic microbes and toxins ( SARS - CoV - 2 , Shiga toxin and CTxB ) share many common features of entry into cells with GII . 4 HuNoV entry mechanisms described herein 24 , 48 , 50 . Fur - ther identi ﬁ cation of a speci ﬁ c receptor coupled with a detailed understanding of the role of each of the cellular factors identi ﬁ ed here for infection will be helpful in deciphering the speci ﬁ c cel - lular tropism of GII . 4 HuNoVs . This raises interesting questions regarding whether utilization of a particular endocytic pathway by these highly infectious pathogens is associated with their pathogenesis and whether features of the CLIC route of entry and associated membrane repair mechanisms represent new ther - apeutic targets .

Preparation of J2 HIE monolayers Human jejunal HIE was established from tissue from a patient under - going bariatric surgery . The study protocol was approved by the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board . Preparation of HIE cultures used in the current study were described previously 2 , 3 . Brie ﬂ y , a permissive , jejunal secretor positive ( J2 ) HIE line was used for almost all the experiments described in this work . An isogenic , genetically modi ﬁ ed J2Fut2 knockout HIE that lacks the FUT2 enzyme , as previously described 4 was used in select membrane wounding studies . To prepare monolayers , 3D cultures of HIE were dissociated by trypsinization followed by gentle pipetting and passing the cells through a 40 μ m cell strainer . Cells were pelleted and resuspended in a proliferation medium [ CMGF ( + ) containing the ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 ( 10 μ M , Sigma ) ] , and seeded in a 96 - well plate ( 100 , 000 cells per well ) .

Statistical analysis Each experiment was performed three or more times independently with two or more HIE replicates ( represented by n ) . For infection assays , two HIE replicates for 1h time point and three independent HIE replicates for the 24h time point were used . RT - qPCR assays were carried out using two or more technical replicates for each HIE repli - cate depending on the treatment of cells . Samples with RNA levels below the limit of detection of the RT - qPCR assay were assigned a value that was one - half the limit ofdetection of the assay . All statistical analyses were performed on GraphPad Prism ( Version 8 . 4 . 3 ) ( Graph - Pad Software ) using geometric mean values . Comparison between untreated and treated groups at 24 h was performed using one - way ANOVA using data from independent HIE replicates of one indepen - dent experiment , with statistical signi ﬁ cance ( P value ) determined using Dunnett ’ s multiple comparisons test . For imaging experiments , statistical signi ﬁ cance was calculated either by one - way ANOVA , Dun - nett ’ s multiple comparisons test ( when comparing with control ) or using two - way ANOVA with Tukey ’ s or Š ídák ’ s multiple comparisons test ( when comparing within groups ) . A P value above 0 . 05 was con - sidered non - signi ﬁ cant . Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article .
