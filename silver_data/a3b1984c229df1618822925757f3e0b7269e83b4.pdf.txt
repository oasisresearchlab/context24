Marston 1 Received : 30 October 2018 / Revised : 8 March 2019 / Accepted : 19 March 2019 # The Author ( s ) 2019 Abstract The monopolin complex is a multifunctional molecular crosslinker , which in S . pombe binds and organises mitotic kinetochores to prevent aberrant kinetochore - microtubule interactions . In the budding yeast S . cerevisiae , whose kinetochores bind a single microtubule , the monopolin complex crosslinks and mono - orients sister kinetochores in meiosis I , enabling the biorientation and segregation of homologs . Here , we show that both the monopolin complex subunit Csm1 and its binding site on the kinetochore protein Dsn1 are broadly distributed throughout eukaryotes , suggesting a conserved role in kinetochore organisation and func - tion . We find that budding yeast Csm1 binds two conserved motifs in Dsn1 , one ( termed Box 1 ) representing the ancestral , widely conserved monopolin binding motif and a second ( termed Box 2 - 3 ) with a likely role in enforcing specificity of sister kinetochore crosslinking . We find that Box 1 and Box 2 - 3 bind the same conserved hydrophobic cavity on Csm1 , suggesting competition or handoff between these motifs . Using structure - based mutants , we also find that both Box 1 and Box 2 - 3 are critical for monopolin function in meiosis . We identify two conserved serine residues in Box 2 - 3 that are phosphorylated in meiosis and whose mutation to aspartate stabilises Csm1 - Dsn1 binding , suggesting that regulated phosphorylation of these residues may play a role in sister kinetochore crosslinking specificity . Overall , our results reveal the monopolin complex as a broadly conserved kinetochore organiser in eukaryotes , which budding yeast have co - opted to mediate sister kinetochore crosslinking through the addition of a second , regulatable monopolin binding interface .

The first meiotic division ( mei - osis I ) requires that the canonical chromosome segregation machinery be modified to direct the segregation of homolo - gous chromosomes , rather than sister chromatids as in mitosis or meiosis II . Central to this process is the monoorientation of sister kinetochores , meaning that at metaphase I attachments are made to microtubules extending from the same spindle pole , rather than opposite poles , thereby ensuring the co - segregation of sister chromatids during anaphase I . The mechanism of meiosis I sister kinetochore monoorientation is best understood in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . S . cerevisiae and its close relatives possess so - called B point centromeres , ^ compact sequence - defined centromeres that bind a single centromeric nucleo - some and assemble a minimal kinetochore ( Meraldi et al . 2006 ; Westermann et al . 2007 ; Gordon et al . 2011 ) . In S . cerevisiae meiosis I , sister kinetochores are fused through the action of the kinetochore - binding monopolin complex , and together bind a single microtubule ( Winey et al . 2005 ; Corbett et al . 2010 ; Corbett and Harrison 2012 ; Sarangapani et al . 2014 ) . The conserved core of the monopolin complex comprises two nucleolar proteins , Csm1 and Lrs4 ( Rabitsch et al . 2003 ) . These proteins form a distinctive V - shaped com - plex , with two Csm1 homodimers bridged at their coiled - coil N - termini by a pair of Lrs4 subunits , thereby positioning two pairs of Csm1 globular - domain B heads ^ ~ 10 nm apart at the apices of the V ( Corbett et al . 2010 ) . Each Csm1 globular domain has a conserved hydrophobic cavity implicated in binding the kinetochore protein Dsn1 , leading to the proposal that monopolin could bridge Dsn1 molecules from sister ki - netochores to physically fuse the kinetochores ( Corbett et al . 2010 ) . Supporting this idea , kinetochore particles purified from cells in meiosis I bind microtubules more strongly than those from cells in mitosis or meiosis II , and this increased strength depends on the monopolin complex ( Sarangapani et al . 2014 ) . Further , addition of recombinant monopolin com - plex to kinetochores purified from mitotic cells increases their microtubule - attachment strength to match that of meiosis I kinetochores ( Sarangapani et al . 2014 ) . A key unresolved question in monopolin function is how the complex specifically recognises and crosslinks sister ki - netochores . This specificity is likely mediated by two addi - tional monopolin complex subunits , the meiosis - specific pro - tein Mam1 and a CK1 δ family kinase , Hrr25 ( Toth et al . 2000 ; Rabitsch et al . 2003 ; Petronczki et al . 2006 ) . Mam1 , which is found only in point - centromere fungi , binds Csm1 and Hrr25 independently , through two flexibly linked domains , thereby acting as a molecular tether to recruit Hrr25 to the monopolin complex ( Corbett and Harrison 2012 ; Ye et al . 2016 ) . While CK1 δ family kinases are near - universal in eukaryotes , Hrr25 orthologs in point - centromere fungi possess a central domain that binds Mam1 and may uniquely regulate the protein ’ s ki - nase activity when it is associated with the monopolin com - plex ( Ye et al . 2016 ) . While the relevant substrates of monopolin - associated Hrr25 have not been identified , the flexibility and length ( ~ 120 Å ) of the Mam1 tether would allow the kinase to access potential substrates within both monopolin and the kinetochore ( Corbett and Harrison 2012 ; Ye et al . 2016 ) . One candidate target is the kinetochore recep - tor for monopolin , Dsn1 , which we previously showed is phosphorylated in vitro by Hrr25 ( Ye et al . 2016 ) . Hrr25 ’ s kinase activity is dispensable for kinetochore localisation of the monopolin complex in vivo ( Petronczki et al . 2006 ) and for fusion of purified kinetochore particles in vitro ( Sarangapani et al . 2014 ) , but is required for sister kinetochore monoorientation in meiosis I ( Petronczki et al . 2006 ) . Together , these data suggest that kinetochore binding is func - tionally distinct from sister kinetochore crosslinking , and that Hrr25 ’ s kinase activity is specifically important for the latter . Apart from its critical role at meiosis I kinetochores , the Csm1 - Lrs4 monopolin subcomplex acts as a molecular crosslinker in at least three other functional contexts in S . cerevisiae , some of which are likely conserved throughout fungi . Csm1 and Lrs4 reside in the nucleolus for the majority of the cell cycle , and a subset of Csm1 - Lrs4 is released from the nucleolus after meiotic prophase to function at meiotic kinetochores ( Rabitsch et al . 2003 ; Clyne et al . 2003 ) . The complex is also released from the nucleolus in mitotic ana - phase , when it localises to kinetochores independently of Mam1 and Hrr25 , and appears to suppress chromosome loss through an unknown mechanism ( Brito et al . 2010 ) . Within the nucleolus , Csm1 and Lrs4 are important for suppressing aberrant recombination within the highly repetitive ribosomal DNA ( rDNA ) repeats , and are also required for Sir2 - mediated transcriptional silencing of rDNA ( Huang et al . 2006 ; Mekhail et al . 2008 ) . Csm1 binds the nucleolar protein Tof2 through the same conserved hydrophobic cavity implicated in Dsn1 binding , and also binds a SUMO peptidase , Ulp2 , in a struc - turally equivalent manner to Mam1 ( Liang et al . 2017 ) . Finally , we have recently identified another Csm1 - binding protein , Dse3 , which binds Csm1 equivalently to Mam1 and Ulp2 ( Singh and Corbett 2018 ) . The biological role of the Dse3 - Csm1 interaction is not known . Outside point - centromere fungi , Csm1 and Lrs4 are also important in chromosome and kinetochore organisation and their molecular function is likely to be conserved . S . pombe Csm1 and Lrs4 ( also called Pcs1 and Mde4 ) prevent aberrant chromosome - microtubule attachments in mitosis ( Gregan et al . 2007 ; Choi et al . 2009 ) and have been proposed to do so through either physical crosslinking of microtubule binding sites within a single kinetochore , or alternatively through Chromosoma recruitment of chromosome - organising condensin complexes to centromeric chromatin ( Tada et al . 2011 ) . Condensin - dependent organisation of centromeres and rDNA is also thought to underlie the importance of Csm1 - Lrs4 in the fungal pathogen Candida albicans ( Burrack et al . 2013 ) . While the monopolin complex is found throughout fungi , orthologs of Csm1 and Lrs4 have so far not been identified in other eu - karyotes , questioning whether monopolin ’ s kinetochore - organising activities are broadly conserved . While the architecture of the budding yeast monopolin complex and the structural basis for its interactions with nu - merous partners are known , direct molecular information about the monopolin - kinetochore interface is still lacking . A ~ 40 - residue region within the disordered N - terminus of the core kinetochore protein , Dsn1 , has been identified as the kinetochore receptor for the monopolin subunit Csm1 ( Sarkar et al . 2013 ) . This region , comprising residues 72 – 110 of S . cerevisiae Dsn1 , is dispensable for vegetative growth but essential for sister kinetochore monoorientation in meiosis I ( Sarkar et al . 2013 ) . Sarkar et al . ( 2013 ) defined three con - served motifs in the Dsn1 72 – 110 region as Box 1 , Box 2 , and Box 3 , and demonstrated their collective importance for Csm1 binding and monopolin function ( Sarkar et al . 2013 ) . Here , we combine comparative genomics of the kinetochore in eukary - otes and structural analysis of reconstituted Csm1 - Dsn1 com - plexes with targeted mutagenesis , genetics , and imaging to dissect the molecular basis for monopolin recruitment and sister kinetochore monoorientation . We find that the Dsn1 Box 1 and Box 2 – 3 regions can each bind the conserved hydrophobic cavity on Csm1 , and that these two interaction modes are mutually exclusive in a given Csm1 - Dsn1 com - plex . We demonstrate that both interfaces are required for robust monopolin recruitment to kinetochores and for sister kinetochore monoorientation , and that simultaneous disrup - tion of both interfaces leads to additive effects on meiosis . We show that both Csm1 and Dsn1 Box 1 are widely con - served in eukaryotes and provide evidence , using S . pombe proteins , that Box 1 is the ancestral kinetochore receptor for monopolin . The Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 region , meanwhile , is con - served only in point - centromere fungi and likely represents an adaptation to the complex ’ s meiotic functions . Further , Dsn1 Box 3 contains two conserved serine residues that are phosphorylated to modulate Dsn1 - Csm1 binding , providing a potential molecular mechanism for sister kinetochore crosslinking specificity in meiosis I . Materials and methods Proteome database We compiled a database of 109 proteomes based on sets that our labs used in previous studies . For the versions and sources of the selected proteomes , we therefore refer to two studies of van Hooff et al . ( van Hooff et al . 2017a , b ) . Notable excep - tions are the proteomes of Bombyx mori , Nasonia virtripennis and Agaricus bisporus , which we have downloaded on January 12 , 2018 , from the Ensembl genomes database ( http : / / ensemblgenomes . org / ) . In addition , we received the proteome of the amoebozoa Physarum polycephalum from the lab of Pauline Schaap ( see for contigs http : / / www . physarum - blast . ovgu . de / ) . Orthologs To create our set of orthologs we searched the 109 proteomes using our in - house established kinetochore HMM profiles of CCAN / Ctf19 complex and KMN network proteins ( van Hooff et al . 2017a ) . In cases where HMM profile searches were incomplete or inconclusive we manually searched for orthologs using previously established procedures and criteria ( van Hooff et al . 2017a ) . In addition , we performed phyloge - netic profiling of 5 lineage - specific kinetochore proteins that were not included in our previous analyses ( Csm1 , Lrs4 , Mam1 , Nkp1 and Nkp2 ) . We excluded Hrr25 , since the reso - lution of kinase evolution and the accurate calling of Hrr25 orthologs requires further in - depth analysis . In addition , since most eukaryotes likely have an Hrr25 ortholog , we assumed that its phylogenetic profiles would not be informative in our analysis . See Table S1 and Supplementary Sequences for presence - absence profiles and sequence information of all orthologs reported in this study . Gene search and gene prediction To systematically search for genes that were absent in our previous analyses , we adopted 3 strategies : ( 1 ) we used our custom made HMM models of either orthologous groups or specific features such as domains and motifs , to search for a gene of interest in six - frame translated genome contigs , ( 2 ) we used an orthologous sequence of a closely related species to query whole genome shotgun sequences using tblastn , ( 3 ) we used an orthologous sequence of a closely related species to query six - frame translated genome contigs using phmmer . To assess sequence quality issues , we manually flagged incom - plete proteins based on multiple sequence alignments of orthologous protein families . Proteins were deemed incom - plete in cases where at least stretches of 15 amino acids were found missing . Common mistakes include incorrect gene fis - sions and fusions and wrongly omitted exons . Predicted or incomplete gene regions were extended with < 50 , 000 bp and used to predict a gene by GENESCAN ( Burge and Karlin 1997 ) and AUGUSTUS ( Stanke et al . 2006 ) , using various species - specific models . Chromosoma Conserved feature extraction pipeline and co - evolutionary analysis The pipeline we used to uncover the Dsn1 - N ( Box 1 ) motif in a wide distribution of eukaryotes is based on a previously established workflow termed ConFeaX ( Tromer et al . 2016 ) . Orthologous sequences were masked using IUpred ( Dosztányi et al . 2005 ) ( disorder / order threshold = 0 . 4 ) and MARCOIL ( Delorenzi and Speed 2002 ) ( coiled - coil thresh - old = 90 ) . ConFeaX starts with a probabilistic search for short conserved regions ( 6 – 100 aa ) in masked orthologs using the MEME algorithm ( option : any number of repeats ) ( Bailey et al . 2009 ) . Significant motif hits are extended on both sides by five residues to compensate for the strict treatment of align - ment information by the MEME algorithm and aligned using MAFFT - LINSI ( Katoh and Standley 2013 ) to introduce gaps . The alignments were modelled using the HMMER packing ( Eddy 2011 ) and sensitive profile HMM searches ( using jackhmmer ) were iterated ( E - value = 1 ) until convergence . In some cases , we manually optimised the HMM profile searches using permissive bit scores and removed obvious false hits . Subsequently , for each of the conserved features , a phylogenetic profile was derived ( present is ‘ 1 ’ and absent is ‘ 0 ’ ) . For all possible pairs , we determined the correlation / similarity using Pearson correlation coefficient ( Wu et al . 2003 ) . Pearson distances ( D = 1 − r ) were used to map the phylogenetic profile similarity of kinetochore proteins in 2D using Barnes - Hut t - SNE ( Maaten and Hinton 2008 ) ( R - pack - age ‘ Rtsne ’ [ perplexity = 5 , dimensions = 2 and theta = 0 ] , see Fig . 1 ) . Sequence logos depicted throughout this study were obtained using weblogo2 ( Crooks et al . 2004 ) . Cloning and protein purification All protein coding sequences were amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into pET - based vectors , either without tags or encoding N - terminal TEV protease - cleavable His 6 or His 6 - SUMO tags . Coexpression cassettes were generated by PCR and re - inserted into the same vectors . Point - mutations were generated by PCR . For expression , vectors were transformed into E . coli Rosetta2 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells ( EMD Millipore ) , and cultures were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance at 600 nm of ~ 0 . 8 . The cultures were shifted to 20 °C and protein expression was induced by the addition of 0 . 25 mM IPTG , and cells were grown ~ 16 h before harvesting by centrifugation . For protein purification , cells were resuspended in protein buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 5 % glycerol , 2 mM β - mercaptoethanol ) plus 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole , lysed by sonication , and centrifuged 30 min at 17 , 000 rpm to remove cell debris . The supernatant was loaded onto a 5 - mL Histrap HP column ( GE Life Sciences ) , washed with protein buffer plus 300 mM NaCl / 20 mM imidazole , then with pro - tein buffer plus 100 mM NaCl / 20 mM Imidazole . Protein was eluted with protein buffer plus 100 mM NaCl / 250 mM imid - azole . Protein was then loaded onto a 5 mL Hitrap Q HP column ( GE Life Sciences ) , washed with protein buffer plus 100 mM NaCl , then eluted with a gradient to 600 mM NaCl . Peak fractions were pooled , and TEV protease ( Tropea et al . 2009 ) was added to cleave His 6 or His 6 - SUMO tags , and the mixture was incubated 16 h at 4 °C ( for Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Sc His 6 - Dsn1 71 – 110 and Cg His 6 - Csm1 69 – 181 : Sc Dsn1 71 – 110 , tag cleavage was not performed ; eluted fractions were instead concentrated and passed directly over a Superdex 200 col - umn ) . After tag cleavage , the mixture was passed over Histrap HP and the flow - through collected , concentrated by ultrafiltration ( Amicon Ultra , EMD Millipore ) , then passed over a HiLoad Superdex 200 size exclusion column ( GE Life Sciences ) in protein buffer plus 300 mM NaCl ( with 1 mM dithiothreitol substituting for β - mercaptoethanol ) for final purification . Protein was exchanged into buffer contain - ing 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl , and 1 mM DTT , concentrated to ~ 10 mg / mL , and stored at 4 °C for crystallisation .

Protein - protein interaction assays For in vitro translation and Ni 2 + pulldown assays , S . pombe Mis13 ( Dsn1 ) residues 1 – 100 and S . cerevisiae Dsn1 residues 71 – 110 ( and point mutants thereof ) were cloned with an N - terminal maltose binding protein tag ( no His 6 - tag ) into a pET - based vector with a Kozak sequence immediately upstream of the coding sequence . These vectors were used as a template for in vitro transcription / translation using a TNT T7 coupled transcription / translation kit ( Promega ) in the presence of 35 S - labelled methionine to generate prey proteins for pulldowns . Ten microliters of transcribed protein mix was incubated with 10 μ g His 6 - tagged bait protein ( S . pombe Csm1 125 – 261 or S . cerevisiae Csm1 69 – 190 ) in 50 μ l buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole , 5 % glycerol , 1 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 ) for 90 min at 4 °C , then 15 μ l Ni - NTA beads were added , and the mixture was incubated a further 45 min . Beads were washed three times with 0 . 5 mL buffer , then eluted with 25 μ L elution buffer ( 2× SDS - PAGE loading dye plus 400 mM imidazole ) and boiled . Samples were run on SDS - PAGE , dried , and scanned with a phosphorimager .

Binding data were fit to a single - site binding model with Prism version 7 ( Graphpad Software ) . Chromosoma Isothermal titration calorimetry Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed on a Microcal ITC 200 ( Malvern Panalytical ) in protein buffer plus 300 mM NaCl and 1 mM dithiothreitol . His 6 - MBP - fused Dsn1 frag - ments at 1 – 1 . 5 mM were injected into a sample cell containing untagged Csm1 at 100 – 200 μ M . Yeast strains and plasmids Yeast strains used in this study were derivatives of SK1 with the exception of those for chromosome loss assays . All strains are given in Table S2 . The CEN5 - GFP marker consists of two components : ( 1 ) an array of tet operator sequences inserted at the chromosome V centromere , and ( 2 ) a Tet repressor protein fused to GFP , which binds to and specifically marks these operator sites and were previously described in ( Toth et al . 2000 ) . MAM1 - 9MYC was also described in ( Toth et al . 2000 ) and MAM1 - yeGFP was described in ( Matos et al . 2008 ) . PDS1 - tdTomato and pCLB2 - CDC20 were described in ( Lee and Amon 2003 ) and ( Matos et al . 2008 ) , respectively . MTW1 - tdTomato was generated in SK1 as described in ( Fernius et al . 2013 ) . pCLB2 - CDC20 were described in ( Lee and Amon 2003 ) and ( Matos et al . 2008 ) , respectively . pGAL - NDT80 pGPD1 - GAL4 ( 848 ) - ER for prophase I block release was described in ( Benjamin et al . 2003 ) . Chromosome III fragment ( CFIII ) for chromosome loss assays carrying HIS3 and Sup11 was described in ( Hieter et al . 1985 ) . Point muta - tions in DSN1 - 6His - 3FLAG were generated in plasmid pSB1590 ( Akiyoshi et al . 2009 ) using the Quick Change II - XL kit ( Agilent Technologies ) and integrated into the DSN1 endogenous locus by PCR - mediated transformation . Plasmids generated in this study are given in Table S3 . Yeast growth conditions Sporulation was induced as described by ( Vincenten et al . 2015 ) . Briefly , diploid yeast were grown overnight on YPG agar ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % Bacto peptone , 2 . 5 % glycerol , and 2 % agar ) , transferred to YPD4 % agar ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % Bacto peptone , 4 % glucose , and 2 % agar ) and incubated for 24 h before inoculating into YEPD liquid medium ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % Bacto peptone , and 2 % glucose ) and incubating with shaking for 24 h . Cells were transferred to BYTA ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % Bacto tryptone , 1 % potassium acetate , 50 mM potassium phthalate ) at an OD 600 = 0 . 2 – 0 . 3 or YPA ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % tryptone peptone , 1 % potassium ace - tate ) and incubated for a further ~ 16 h . Cells were washed once with sterile distilled water and re - suspended in SPO me - dium ( 0 . 3 % potassium acetate , pH 7 ) at an OD 600 = 1 . 8 – 1 . 9 ; t = 0 . Cells were incubated at 30 °C for the duration . Benomyl sensitivity assay Haploid cells were grown at room temperature for ~ 16 h in YEPD with shaking . Cultures were then diluted to an OD 600 = 0 . 1 in water before making serial 1 in 10 dilutions . Dilutions were plated on either YPD agar or YPD containing 12 % benomyl and incubated at 25 °C for 3 days . Chromosome loss assay Assay measures the loss of chromosome III fragment ( CFIII ) carrying HIS3 and Sup11 described in ( Hieter et al . 1985 ) . Loss of Sup11 , via loss of CFIII , stops suppression of ade2 - 1 mutation causing a colony colour change from white to red ( Koshland and Hieter 1987 ) . Cells were grown in minimal media lacking histidine for ~ 16 h at room temperature . Cells were washed in YEPD liquid media without the addition of adenine . Cells were diluted to estimated 120 cells per plate and plated on YPD agar without the addition of adenine . After incubation at 25 °C for 5 days , the fraction of half - sectored colonies was scored . The number of half red colonies was divided by the total number of colonies to calculate the CFIII loss rate per cell division . Any completely red colonies were excluded as CFIII must have been lost prior to plating . Chromatin immunoprecipitation qPCR Cells carrying pCLB2 - CDC20 ( Lee and Amon 2003 ) were induced to sporulate . After 6 h in SPO , cells were fixed in 1 % formaldehyde for 1 h , washed twice with TBS ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl ) and once with 1× FA lysis buffer ( 50 mM HEPES - KOH at pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % v / v Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % w / v Sodium Deoxycholate ) containing 0 . 1 % w / v SDS before resuspending in 1× FA lysis buffer / 0 . 1 % SDS . Cells were lysed in a Fastprep Bio - pulveriser FP120 with silica beads ( Biospec Products ) . Samples were sonicated to fragment chromosomal DNA using a BioRupter ( Diagenode ) . Aliquots of the resul - tant chromatin solution were incubated with either anti - Myc ( 9E10 , Biolegend ) or anti - FLAG ( M2 , Sigma ) antibodies and Protein G Dynabeads ( Life Technologies ) overnight at 4 °C . Following sequential washes with CWB1 ( FA lysis buffer / 0 . 1 % SDS / 275 mM NaCl ) , CWB2 ( FA lysis buffer / 0 . 1 % SDS / 500 mM NaCl ) , CWB3 ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 , 0 . 25 M LiCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % Na Deoxycholate ) and CWB4 ( TE : 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 , 1 mM EDTA ) , immunoprecipitates and 1 / 100 input chromatin were recovered by boiling ( 10 min ) with a 10 % slurry of Chelex - 100 resin before adding proteinase K ( 0 . 125 mg ) and incubating at 55 °C for 30 min , then boiled for a further 10 min . Samples were centrifuged and supernatant taken for qPCR . qPCR was performed on a on a Roche Lightcycler with LUNA universal qPCR Master Mix ( New England Biolabs ) . Chromosoma Primers used for qPCR are given in Table S4 . To calculate ChIP enrichment / input , Δ CT was calculated according to : Δ CT = ( CT ( ChIP ) − [ CT ( Input ) − logE ( input dilution factor ) ] ) where E represents the specific primer efficiency value . Enrichment / input value was obtained from the following for - mula : E ^ − Δ CT . qPCR was performed in triplicate from three or more independent cultures . Error bars represent standard error . Figures show the mean values for each strain , averaged over all individual experiments and biological replicates . Wild type and no tag controls were included for reference in all individ - ual experiments and replicates . The number of replicates for each strain is indicated in the figure legends . Western blotting Samples for immunoblot analysis were fixed in 5 % TCA and cell pellets were washed once with acetone . Cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 1 mM EDTA , and 50 mM DTT contain - ing protease inhibitors with glass beads , boiled in 1× sample buffer and visualised by detection of chemiluminesence on au - toradiograms . Mouse Anti - FLAG M2 antibodies ( Sigma ) and mouse Anti - cMYC ( 9E10 , Biolegend ) were used at 1 : 1000 dilution , and rabbit anti - PGK1 ( Marston lab stock ) was used at 1 : 10 , 000 dilution . Spore viability Haploid yeast strains with the relevant genotypes were mated and single diploid colonies were incubated on SPO agar . A minimum of two diploid isolates were chosen for spore dis - section . The total number of tetrads dissected for each strain is indicated in the figure legend . Spores were allowed to grow for 2 days on YPDA at 30 °C before scoring the number of viable colonies per tetrad . Fixed cell imaging Cells carrying pCLB2 - CDC20 ( Lee and Amon 2003 ) were induced to sporulate . After 6 h in SPO , cells were fixed in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde for 10 min , washed in 80 % ethanol and suspended in DAPI 1 μ g / mL . Cells were counted as contain - ing 1 or 2 GFP foci . Each strain was analysed in at least three independent biological repeats and the average is shown with standard error bars . Live cell imaging Cells were induced to sporulate as above . Cells were incubat - ed 2 h in SPO medium in flasks for analysis of chromosome segregation . Alternatively , for Mam1 localisation , cells were incubated for 6 h in SPO before addition of 1 μ M β - estradiol and incubated for a further 15 min to release cells from pro - phase I arrest . Cells were immobilised on Concanavalin A - coated cover slips in ibidi 4 - well or 8 - well dishes , fresh spor - ulation media was added to the dish and imaging commenced . Imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 ( Zeiss UK , Cambridge ) equipped with a Hamamatsu Flash 4 sCMOS camera , Prior motorised stage and Zen 2 . 3 acquisition software . Images were processed in Image J and 8 Z - stacks were projected to maximum intensity . Representative movies were generated using imaris , cells were projected to 2D using max intensities over the projection line ( MIP ) and contrast was adjusted to highlight florescent markers . Mass spectrometry Cells carrying pCLB2 - CDC20 ( Lee and Amon 2003 ) were in - duced to sporulate . After 6 h in SPO , cells were frozen . Kinetochores were isolated as described in ( Akiyoshi et al . 2009 ) with some modifications . Extract was prepared by break - ing yeast cells with a Retsch ball mill ( 5 × 3 min at 30 Hz for meiotic cells , with 5 min in liquid nitrogen in between ) followed by ultracentrifugation ( 24 , 000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C ) . Beads conjugated with anti - Flag antibodies were incubated with extract for 2 . 5 h with constant rotation , followed by three washes with buffer BH / 0 . 15 ( 25 mM HEPES , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM EGTA pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 , 150 mM KCl , 15 % glyc - erol ) containing protease inhibitors ( at 10 μ g / mL final concen - tration for each of chymostatin , leupeptin , antipain , pepstatin A , E - 64 , aprotinin ; 2 mM final AEBSF – Pefablock , 1 mM NEM , 0 . 2 μ M microcystin and cOmplete EDTA - free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Sigma - Aldrich ) ) phosphatase inhibitors ( 0 . 4 mM Na orthovanadate , 0 . 2 μ M microcystin , 4 mM β - glycerophosphate , 2 mM Na pyrophosphate , 10 mM NaF ) and 2 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) . Beads were further washed twice with BH / 0 . 15 with protease inhibitors . Beads were heated to 70 °C for 10 min in 50 mM Tris pH 8 with 5 % SDS , to elute the proteins . Protein samples were run on SDS - PAGE ( NuPAGE Novex 4 – 12 % Bis - Tris gel , Life Technologies , UK ) , in NuPAGE buffer ( MES ) and visualised using Instant Blue ™ stain ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) . The stained gel bands were excised and de - stained with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) and 100 % ( v / v ) acetonitrile ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) and in gel digestion was modified from ( Shevchenko et al . 1996 ) to use AspN . In brief , proteins were reduced in 10 mM dithiothreitol ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) for 30 min at 37 °C and alkylated in 55 mM iodoacetamide ( Sigma - Aldrich , UK ) for 20 min at ambient temperature in the dark . They were then digested overnight at 37 °C with 13 ng / μ L AspN ( Promega , UK ) . Phosphopeptides were enriched using a titanium dioxide ( TiO 2 ) spin tips kit ( High - Select ™ TiO2 Phosphopeptide Enrichment Kit , ThermoFisher Scientific ) . The sample was dried in vacuum centrifuge for storage . The flow through sample was loaded onto StageTip as described by Rappsilber et al . ( 2003 ) , peptides were eluted in 40 μ L of Chromosoma 80 % acetonitrile in 0 . 1 % TFA and concentrated down to 1 μ L using a vacuum centrifuge ( Concentrator 5301 , Eppendorf , UK ) . Samples were prepared for LC - MS / MS analysis by di - luting them to 6 μ L with 0 . 1 % TFA . LC - MS - analyses were performed on an Orbitrap Fusion ™ Lumos ™ Tribrid ™ Mass Spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , UK ) coupled on - line to an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano System ( Dionex , Thermo Fisher Scientific , UK ) . Peptides were separated on a 75 × 50 cm EASY - Spray column ( 2 μ m particle size , 100 Å , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) assembled in an EASY - Spray source ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , UK ) , operated at a constant temperature of 50 °C . Peptides from the phospho - enriched samples were resuspended in 40 μ L of 0 . 1 % TFA , vortexed and sonicated for 5 min and then concentrated down to 6 μ L with vacuum centrifugation , before they were injected on the mass spectrometer . For both sets of samples the same gradient and method were applied . Briefly , mobile phase A consisted of 0 . 1 % formic acid in deionised water while mobile phase B consisted of 80 % acetonitrile and 0 . 1 % formic acid . Peptides were loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 0 . 3 μ L / min and eluted at a flow rate of 0 . 25 μ L / min according to the following gradient : 2 to 40 % buffer B in 120 min , then to 95 % in 11 min ( total run time of 160 min ) . Survey scans were performed at 120 , 000 resolution ( scan range 350 – 1500 m / z ) with an ion target of 4 . 0e5 . MS2 was performed in the ion trap at rapid scan mode with ion target of 2 . 0E4 and HCD fragmentation with normalised collision energy of 27 ( Olsen et al . 2007 ) . The isolation window in the quadrupole was set at 1 . 4 Thomson . Only ions with charge between 2 and 7 were se - lected for MS2 . The MaxQuant software platform ( Cox and Mann 2008 ) version 1 . 6 . 1 . 0 was used to process raw files and search was conducted against the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( strain SK1 ) complete / reference proteome set of Saccharomyces Genome Database ( released in December , 2016 ) , using the Andromeda search engine ( Cox et al . 2011 ) . The first search peptide tol - erance was set to 20 ppm while the main search peptide tol - erance was set to 4 . 5 pm . Isotope mass tolerance was 2 ppm and maximum charge to 7 . AspN was chosen as a protease , allowing two missed cleavages . Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed modification . Oxidation of methio - nine and acetylation of the N - terminal as well as phosphory - lation of serine , threonine and tyrosine were set as variable modifications . Results The monopolin complex subunit Csm1 is an ancient kinetochore component We previously reported extensive phylogenetic and evolution - ary analysis of eukaryotic kinetochore subunits , but monopolin complex subunits were not included ( van Hooff et al . 2017a ) . Reasoning that a role for monopolin in preventing merotelic kinetochore - microtubule attachments , as reported in S . pombe ( Gregan et al . 2007 ; Rumpf et al . 2010 ; Tada et al . 2011 ) , may be a more widely conserved function of the complex , we performed phylogenetic analysis of the Csm1 and Lrs4 monopolin subunits . We identified Csm1 orthologs in a wide variety of eukaryotic lineages out - side fungi , including Archeaplastida ( e . g . Arabidopsis thaliana Titan - 9 and in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ) and Amoebozoa ( e . g . Dictyostelium discoideum Cenp - 68 ) ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Based on this distribution , we conclude that Csm1 was likely a kinetochore subunit in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor ( LECA ) , and has since been lost from various eukaryotic lineages including in most metazoans . In contrast to Csm1 , we could not detect orthologs of the Csm1 binding partner Lrs4 outside fungi . Since Lrs4 is predicted to be mostly unstructured ( Corbett et al . 2010 ) , its sequence like - ly diverges more quickly than Csm1 , making any Lrs4 orthologs difficult to identify . We next reasoned that species with Csm1 orthologs should also possess a conserved binding site on another kinetochore subunit , with the most likely candidate being the Mis12 com - plex subunit Dsn1 , which is implicated in Csm1 recruitment in S . cerevisiae ( Corbett et al . 2010 ; Sarkar et al . 2013 ) . Using our ConFeaX pipeline ( Tromer et al . 2016 ) , we identified a highly conserved motif in the N - terminus of Dsn1 ( Dsn1 - N ) that is characterised by a stretch of negatively charged resi - dues , two conserved phenylalanine residues , and a stretch of positively charged residues ( Fig . 1a , S1a ) . Strikingly , Dsn1 proteins in the Oomycetes appear to possess two Dsn1 - N mo - tifs , one with a canonical ( negative - FF - positive ) directionality and the other with an inverted ( positive - FF - negative ) direc - tionality ( Fig . S1b ) . We also identify two Dsn1 - N motifs in Dsn1 orthologs of Encephalitozoon species ( Fig . S1b ) . As budding yeast Csm1 forms a homodimer , this pattern suggests that in both Oomycetes and Encephalitozoon , a single copy of Dsn1 may simultaneously bind both protomers of a Csm1 dimer ( Fig . S1c ) . Overall , the phylogenetic profile of Dsn1 - N throughout eukaryotes is strikingly similar to that of Csm1 ( r = 0 . 799 ) ( Fig . 1b , c ) , indicative of co - evolution and supporting the idea that Dsn1 - N is the kinetochore - targeting motif of Csm1 in many eukaryotic lineages . We also found that Csm1 proteins throughout eukaryotes show high conser - vation in the conserved hydrophobic cavity previously impli - cated in Dsn1 binding ( Corbett et al . 2010 ) ( Fig . S1d ) . Narrowing our analysis to fungi , we identified two major groups of species with differing conservation patterns in the Dsn1 N - terminus . Most fungi , including S . pombe , contain a short conserved motif matching the widely conserved Dsn1 - N motif identified above ( Fig . S2a , b ) . In contrast , in S . cerevisiae and other species with identified point - centromeres and containing a Mam1 ortholog — suggesting a Chromosoma likely role for monopolin in meiotic sister kinetochore monoorientation — Dsn1 contains the extended Box 1 - 2 - 3 re - gion identified previously ( Sarkar et al . 2013 ) ( Fig . S2c – e ) . Strikingly , budding yeast Dsn1 Box 1 bears a strong resem - blance to the Dsn1 - N motif conserved in a wide range of eukaryotes ( Fig . 2a , S2 ) . Thus , while Dsn1 - N / Box 1 appears to be an ancestral , widely conserved Csm1 - targeting motif , Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 likely evolved as an adaptation to monopolin ’ s role in sister kinetochore monoorientation in point - centromere fungi . Reconstitution and structure of a budding yeast Csm1 - Dsn1 complex To better understand the interactions between the budding yeast monopolin complex and the kinetochore , and the roles of the Dsn1 Box 1 , 2 , and 3 regions in Csm1 binding , we sought to reconstitute a complex between Csm1 and the Dsn1 N - terminus . We first separately purified the S . cerevisiae Csm1 globular domain ( residues 69 – 190 of 190 ) and the Dsn1 Box 1 - 2 - 3 region ( residues 71 – 110 of 576 ) and measured a binding affinity ( K d ) of 12 μ M by iso - thermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) ( Fig . S3a ) . We next co - expressed and purified a stable S . cerevisiae ( Sc ) Csm1 69 – 181 : Dsn1 71 – 110 complex ( with the C - terminal 9 disordered res - idues of Csm1 removed ) , but were unable to identify crystallisation conditions for this complex . We therefore screened paralogs from several related budding yeast , and successfully purified a complex between the Candida glabrata ( Cg ) Csm1 globular domain ( residues 69 – 181 ) and the Dsn1 Box 1 - 2 - 3 region ( residues 14 – 72 ) ( Fig . S3b , c ) . We identified crystallisation conditions for this complex and de - termined the structure to 2 . 3 Å resolution ( Table S5 ) . The Cg Dsn1 Box 1 - 2 - 3 region shows high homology with the equiv - alent region of Sc Dsn1 ( 56 % identity and 82 % similarity between Sc Dsn1 residues 72 – 110 and Cg Dsn1 residues 32 – 67 ) ( Fig . 2b ) , and we were also able to reconstitute a com - plex of Cg Csm1 69 – 181 ( 56 % identical to Sc Csm1 in this region ) with Sc Dsn1 71 – 110 ( Fig . S3d ) . We crystallised and determined the structure of this chimeric complex to 2 . 5 Å resolution . We also determined a 3 . 0 Å - resolution structure of Cg Csm1 69 – 181 in complex with the Csm1 - binding region of Cg Mam1 ( residues 162 – 216 ) ( Fig . S3e , Fig . S4 ) . While our attempts to purify a ternary complex of Csm1 , Dsn1 , and Mam1 were unsuccessful , these crystal structures provide a comprehensive picture of how budding yeast Csm1 interacts through its C - terminal globular domain with Dsn1 and Mam1 . Our prior biochemical data showed that Sc Dsn1 interacts with a highly conserved hydrophobic cavity on the Csm1 globular domain ( Corbett et al . 2010 ) . Later work implicated the Dsn1 Box 1 - 2 - 3 region as necessary for binding Csm1 , and mutagenesis revealed a particular requirement for the Box 2 - 3 region ( Sarkar et al . 2013 ) . Our structures of the Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Dsn1 14 – 72 ( Fig . 2c ) and Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Sc Dsn1 71 – 110 ( Fig . 2d ) complexes reveal a consistent interface between Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 and Csm1 ( Fig . S5 ) , while the Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Dsn1 14 – 72 structure reveals a second interface be - tween Csm1 and Dsn1 Box 1 ( Fig . 2e , S6a ) . Therefore , all three conserved segments in the Dsn1 N terminus contact Csm1 . Intriguingly , the conserved hydrophobic cavity on Csm1 is involved in binding both Dsn1 Box 3 ( in both the Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Dsn1 14 – 72 and Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Sc Dsn1 71 – 110 structures ) and Box 1 ( in the Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Dsn1 14 – 72 struc - ture ) , which form strikingly similar interfaces with Csm1 ( Fig . 2c – e ) . We next sought to understand which of these interfaces are important for sister kinetochore monoorientation during meiosis . Dsn1 Box 2 contributes to successful meiosis In the crystal structures of both Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Dsn1 14 – 72 and the chimeric Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Sc Dsn1 71 – 110 complex , the Dsn1 Box 2 – 3 region wraps around the Csm1 globular domain , with Box 2 forming an α - helix that packs against the B side ^ of the Csm1 dimer , and Box 3 binding the Csm1 hydrophobic cavity ( Fig . 2c , d ; Fig . S5 ) . Box 2 is highly conserved in yeast with point centromeres , with an alternating pattern of hydro - phobic ( Sc Dsn1 L88 / L92 / L95 ) and polar ( Sc Dsn1 E90 / N94 / D97 ) residues ( Fig . 3a ) . In both structures , this region forms an α - helix oriented with the hydrophobic residues facing out - ward into solution , and the polar residues packed tightly against Csm1 ( Fig . 3a ) . This binding mode is unexpected , as hydrophobic residues are most often buried in protein - protein interfaces , rather than solvent - exposed . To determine the im - portance of Dsn1 Box 2 for Csm1 binding and successful meiosis , we mutated either the polar or hydrophobic residues in Box 2 and tested their function in vivo and in vitro . First , we produced the Dsn1 Box 1 - 2 - 3 region ( 71 – 110 ) by in vitro translation , and performed pulldown assays with purified Csm1 ( Fig . 2f ) . This assay showed that mutation of the polar residues contacting Csm1 ( Dsn1 E90 , N94 , and D97 ) to lysine did not detectably reduce Csm1 binding , while mutation to alanine appeared to increase binding ( Fig . 2f ) . In contrast , mutation of the solvent - exposed hydrophobic residues of Dsn1 Box 2 ( L88 , L92 , and L95 ) impaired binding to Csm1 , with lysine substitutions having the greatest effect and alanine or aspartate substitutions causing a modest reduction in bind - ing ( Fig . 2f ) . This suggests that , at least when Dsn1 Box 1 and 3 are present , mutations in the Csm1 - contacting surface of Box 2 do not compromise binding , while the solvent - exposed hydrophobic residues play an unexpectedly impor - tant role in Csm1 binding . To determine the role of Dsn1 Box 2 in meiosis , we gener - ated S . cerevisiae strains with mutations in either the Csm1 - contacting polar residues ( Dsn1 E90A / N94A / D97A and Dsn1 E90K / N94K / D97K ) or the solvent - exposed hydrophobic Chromosoma residues ( Dsn1 L88A / L92A / L95A ) . Impaired monopolin func - tion causes mis - segregation of chromosomes during meiosis , producing aneuploid gametes which are frequently inviable .

Mutation of the solvent - exposed hydrophobic residues ( Dsn1 - L88A / L92A / L95A ) , which strongly affected Csm1 binding in vitro , also reduced spore viability ( Fig . 3b ) .

We imaged live DSN1 - L88A / L92A / L95A , DSN1 - E90A / N94A / D97A , and DSN1 - E90K / N94K / D97K cells carrying a heterozygous CEN5 - GFP marker ( which tracks the segregation of a single sister chromatid pair in meiosis I ; see B Materials and Methods ^ ) , a kinetochore marker ( Mtw1 - tdTomato ) , and a marker for anaphase I onset ( Pds1 - tdTomato ) . Using these strains , we detected monoorientation defects consistent with each mutation ’ s effect on spore viabili - ty : While virtually all wild type and DSN1 - E90A / N94A / D97A cells segregate CEN5 - GFP foci to the same pole during ana - phase I , segregation of CEN5 - GFP foci to opposite poles was observed for ~ 20 % of DSN1 - L88A / L92A / L95A and E90K / N94K / D97K cells during anaphase I ( Fig . 3c , d ; Movies S1 – S3 ) . We observed frequent splitting and re - association of CEN5 - GFP prior to final separation of Mtw1 - tdTomato into two foci which then divided into four foci ( Movies S1 – S3 ) . This is characteristic of monopolin mutants where the persis - tence of centromere cohesion at anaphase I prevents efficient segregation of bioriented sister chromatids to opposite poles until anaphase II ( Toth et al . 2000 ; Rabitsch et al . 2003 ; Petronczki et al . 2006 ) . To confirm that the observed behaviour is due to biorientation of sister chromatids in meiosis I , we analysed metaphase I - arrested cells where spindle forces cause bioriented sister kinetochores to separate prior to anaphase I onset ( Lee and Amon 2003 ) . Consistent with our live cell imaging , heterozygous CEN5 - GFP foci split with increased frequency in metaphase I in DSN1 - E90K / N94K / D97K cells , though we also observed a low frequency of CEN5 - GFP split - ting in DSN1 - E90A / N94A / D97A metaphase I cells ( Fig . S7 ) . While these effects are less severe than observed in a mam1 Δ mutant ( Fig . 3d , S7 ) , the data nonetheless indicate that Dsn1 Box 2 is important for co - segregation of sister chromatids dur - ing anaphase I . Although it remains possible that amino acid changes cause structural perturbations of the Dsn1 Box 2 α - helix , Box 2 mutants DSN1 - L88A / L92A / L95A , DSN1 - E90A / N94A / D97A or DSN1 - E90K / N94K / D97K do not cause sensitivity to microtubule - depolymerising drugs ( Fig . S8a ) , indicating that mitotic chromosome segregation is largely unperturbed . These findings suggest , unexpectedly , that the hydrophobic outer surface is critical for sister chromatid co - segregation during meiosis I . Interestingly , the polar residues on the Csm1 - binding inner surface of the Dsn1 Box 2 α - helix can be mutated to alanine without affecting spore viability or co - segregation of sister kinetochores , at least in the presence of functional Box 1 and 3 , while mutation of these residues to lysine reduces spore viability and sister chromatid co - segregation without affecting Csm1 binding in vitro . Potentially , the Dsn1 Box 2 α - helix is required to make addi - tional interactions that are important for monopolin function in vivo , though we cannot rule out minor structural changes caused by these mutations . Dsn1 Box 3 is critical for meiosis While Dsn1 Box 2 forms an α - helix and associates with the B side ^ of the Csm1 dimer , Box 3 forms an extended conformation that packs tightly against the Csm1 con - served hydrophobic cavity ( Fig . 4a ; Fig . S5a – c , g , h ) . This binding is equivalent to the nucleolar protein Tof2 , which we previously showed shares limited sequence homology with Dsn1 Box 3 ( Liang et al . 2017 ) ( Fig . S9 ) . The core of the interaction comprises two con - served hydrophobic residues ( Sc Dsn1 V104 and F107 ) inserted into the conserved hydrophobic cavity on Csm1 . These residues are bracketed by positively charged amino acids ( Sc Dsn1 K102 and R103 ) on the N - terminal side , and highly conserved serine residues ( Sc Dsn1 S109 and S110 ) on the C - terminal side ( Fig . 4a ; Fig . S5 g , h ) . Mutations in the hydrophobic residues either to alanine ( DSN1 - V104A / F107A ) or aspartate ( DSN1 - V104D / F107D ) abolished Csm1 binding in vitro ( Fig . 2f ) . Consistently , Dsn1 Box 3 mutations V104A / F107A and V104D / F107D led to a marked decrease in spore viability , whether present in single copy ( heterozygous ) or both copies ( homozygous ) ( Fig . 4b ) . We also observed increased separation of CENV - GFP labelled sister chromatids to opposite poles in anaphase  Fig . 3 Dsn1 Box 2 contributes to successful meiosis . a Close - up view of the Cg Dsn1 Box 2 region ( orange ) interacting with the B side ^ of a Csm1 protomer ( blue with white surface ) in the Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Cg Dsn1 14 – 72 complex .

Diploid cells carrying the indicated homozygous mutations in DSN1 were sporulated , dissected , and the number ofspores that formed colonies from eachtetrad wasscored .

Diploid strains used were generated from matings between AMy1827 and AMy1828 or AMy1835 ( wild type ) , AMy1932 and AMy1947 ( mam1 Δ ) , AMy21921 and AMy22719 ( DSN1 - L88A L92A L95A ) , AMy23151 and AMy23152 ( DSN1 - E90A N94A D97A ) , and AMy24629 and AMy24632 ( DSN1 - E90K N94K D97K ) ; c , d Live cell imaging of heterozygous CEN5 - GFP foci during meiosis reveals defective monoorientation in the presence of Dsn1 Box 2 mutations .

While wild type cells segregate a single CEN5 - GFP focus to one pole , some DSN1 - L88A L92A L95A cells split GFP foci and exhibit delayed meiosis II . Arrowheads indicate position of CEN5 - GFP foci during anaphase I , revealing whether they segregate to the same pole ( monooriented , as in the wild type example ) or opposite poles ( bioriented as in DSN1 - L88A L92A L95A cells ) . Images are from frames taken at 15 min intervals ; d Scoring of GFP foci position at anaphase I onset , defined as the first occasion on which Mtw1 - tdTomato segregate . Strains used were AMy25832 ( wild type ; n = 78 ) , AMy25881 ( DSN1 - L88A L92A L95A ; n = 26 ) , AMy25763 ( DSN1 - E90A N94A D97A ; n = 39 ) and AMy25881 ( DSN1 - E90K N94K D97K ; n = 93 ) Chromosoma I ( Fig . 4c ; Movie S4 and S5 ) and splitting of sister CEN5 - GFP foci in metaphase I with these mutants ( Fig . S7 ) . Finally , we measured monopolin complex re - cruitment to kinetochores in vivo by analysing Mam1 association with a representative kinetochore by chroma - tin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) . This assay revealed that homozygous Dsn1 Box 3 mutations ( either DSN1 - V104A / F107A or DSN1 - V104D / F107D ) caused a signif - icant reduction in Mam1 association with kinetochores compared to wild type cells ( Fig . 4d ) .

S10a ) , and kinetochore association of both Dsn1 itself and the KMN - network protein Ndc80 was unaffected ( Fig . S10b , c ) . Furthermore , Box 3 mutations did not result in benomyl sensitivity or cause increased chromosome loss , indicating that they did not affect mitotic chromosome segregation ( Fig . S8 ) , consistent with previous observations using Dsn1 truncated at res - idue 110 ( Sarkar et al . 2013 ) . Collectively , these find - ings establish that the interface between Dsn1 Box 3 and Csm1 is critical for sister kinetochore co - segregation during meiosis I . Phosphorylation of Dsn1 Box 3 residues may stabilise Csm1 binding Dsn1 Box 3 contains two serine residues ( Sc Dsn1 S109 and S110 ) that are highly conserved throughout budding yeast ( Fig . S2c , e ) . These serine residues are disordered in both crystal structures but are positioned close to conserved lysine residues in Csm1 ( Cg Csm1 K172 , K175 , and K179 ) ( Fig . 4a ; Fig . S5a – c , g , h ) . The high conservation and physical proxim - ity of these serine residues to positively charged residues on Csm1 suggests that these residues may become phosphorylat - ed , and that phosphorylation could reinforce the observed binding mode between Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 and Csm1 . Indeed , mass spectrometry of Dsn1 purified from metaphase I - arrested cells showed that S109 and S110 are phosphorylated in vivo ( Fig . S11 ) . Further supporting this idea , we could reconstitute a complex of Cg Csm1 69 – 181 and a minimised Cg Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 construct ( residues 43 – 67 ) with both S66 and S67 ( equivalent to Sc Dsn1 S109 and S110 ) mutated to aspartate to mimic phosphorylation ( referred to as Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Dsn1 43 - 67 DD ) ( Fig . S3f ) . We determined a 1 . 8 Å - resolution structure of this complex ( Table S5 ) , which closely agrees with both structures described above with the addition of a specific in - teraction between Dsn1 residue D66 and Csm1 K172 ( Fig . 4e ; S5b , e , h ; S6c ) . Consistent with the idea that phosphorylation of Dsn1 Box 3 promotes Csm1 binding , we found that Sc Dsn1 71 – 110 with the phosphomimetic S109D / S110D mutation showed increased binding to Sc Csm1 69 – 190 in vitro ( Fig . 2f ) . Furthermore , sister CEN5 - GFP foci segregated normally to the same pole in Dsn1 S109D / S110D cells and spore via - bility was comparable to that of wild type cells whether one or both copies of Dsn1 carried the mutations ( Fig . 4b , c ; Movie S6 ) . Consistently , ChIP and live cell imaging showed that Mam1 was localised to centromeres in cells carrying the Dsn1 S109D / S110D phosphomimetic mutations ( Fig . 4d , f ) . We also analysed a non - phosphorylatable S109A / S110A mu - tant and found that , although ChIP showed that kinetochore - associated Mam1 levels in a metaphase I arrest were reduced to a level comparable to that caused by the V104A / F107A and V104D / F104D mutations ( Fig . 4d ) , the effect on spore viability and sister chromatid co - segregation was less pro - nounced ( Fig . 4b , c : Movie S7 ) and CEN5 - GFP separation at metaphase was not greatly increased ( Fig . S7 ) . Interestingly , live cell imaging of Mam1 - GFP revealed a new localisation pattern in S109A / S110A cells where a single bright focus in the vicinity of kinetochores was observed ( Fig . 4f ) . The identity of this Mam1 - GFP focus remains un - clear , but it could explain the ability of the S109A / S110A mutant to support sister kinetochore monoorientation . Therefore , phosphorylation of S109 / S110 may be dispensable for the initial recruitment of monopolin to kinetochores , but is important for its maintenance into metaphase I .  Fig . 4 Dsn1 Box 3 residues are critical for meiosis . a Close - up view of the Cg Dsn1 Box 3 region ( orange ) interacting with the Csm1 conserved hydrophobic cavity ( blue with white surface ) in the Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Cg Dsn1 14 – 72 complex .

S2c ) . In contrast , Dsn1 Box 1 is highly conserved throughout fungi , suggesting a possible ancestral function ( Fig . 1 , S2 ) . A recent study has shown that Dsn1 Box 1 is dispensable for binding to Csm1 as measured by yeast two - hybrid assay ( Sarkar et al . 2013 ) , and our own biochemical reconstitutions reveal that the Box 2 - 3 region alone binds stably to Csm1 , at least when the conserved Box 3 serine residues are mutated to aspartate ( Fig . S3f ) . These findings have suggested that Dsn1 Box 1 may not be important for monopolin complex function in point - centromere fungi including S . cerevisiae . Our structure of the Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Cg Dsn1 14 – 72 complex shows how Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 binds Csm1 , but also reveals a plausible Csm1 binding mode for Box 1 . In the structure , Dsn1 Box 1 extends outward from the Csm1 - Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 complex described above , and interacts with a crystallograph - ic symmetry - related Csm1 monomer . This interface is remark - ably similar to the Box 3 interface : Box 1 inserts two con - served hydrophobic residues ( Cg Dsn1 F32 and F34 , equiva - lent to Sc Dsn1 L72 and F74 ) into the conserved hydrophobic cavity on Csm1 , and these residues are bracketed by positively and negatively charged residues that make specific interac - tions with Csm1 as in the Box 3 interface ( Fig . 5a ) . Interestingly , Box 1 is oriented in the opposite direction across the Csm1 hydrophobic cavity than Box 3 , with positively charged residues ( Cg Dsn1 R35 and R36 , equivalent to Sc Dsn1 K75 and R76 ) C - terminal to the hydrophobic residues , and negatively charged residues ( Cg Dsn1 D29 and E30 , equivalent to Sc Dsn1 S29 and P30 ) N - terminal ( Fig . 5a ; Fig . S6 ) . Thus , both Dsn1 Box 1 and Box 3 bind the same surface of Csm1 , through similar but distinct interaction modes . This structural plasticity provides a model for how Dsn1 proteins with two Dsn1 - N motifs interact with Csm1 : the first motif ( Dsn1 - N ) could bind one Csm1 protomer equiv - alently to Box 3 , with the second ( Dsn1 - N2 ) binding a dimer - related Csm1 protomer equivalently to Box 1 . All identified Dsn1 proteins with two Dsn1 - N motifs possess at least nine residues between the central hydrophobic residues in the two motifs , enough to bridge the ~ 30 Å distance between the two sites . The location of positively charged residues N - terminal to Dsn1 - N1 and C - terminal to Dsn1 - N2 in these proteins ( Fig . S1b ) further supports this model . Importantly for monopolin ’ s meiotic functions and unlike oomycete and Encphalitozoon Dsn1 proteins , budding yeast Dsn1 Box 1 and Box 2 - 3 inter - faces with Csm1 are incompatible with one another , in the sense that a single Dsn1 monomer could not form both inter - actions with a single Csm1 dimer ( Fig . S6a ) . To test the importance of Dsn1 Box 1 for Csm1 bind - ing and sister kinetochore monoorientation , we mutated Sc Dsn1 L72 and F74 to either alanine or aspartate . Both mutations reduced binding of Dsn1 to Csm1 in our in vitro pulldowns , with the L72D / F74D mutation having the greatest effect ( Fig . 2f ) . Interestingly , these mutations also had a profound effect on spore viability , Mam1 asso - ciation with centromeres during metaphase I , and segre - gation of sister chromatids during anaphase I ( Fig . 5b – d ; Movies S8 and S9 ) , though not on benomyl sensitivity or mitotic chromosome loss ( Fig . S8 ) . Interestingly , Dsn1 Box 1 mutations caused a reduction in spore viability even when only one copy of Dsn1 carried these mutations ( Fig . 5b ) . The presence of only a single copy of MAM1 , in contrast , has no detectable effect on spore viability ( Fig . 5b ) . Truncation of the first 110 amino acids of one copy of Dsn1 was previously found to have a dominant - negative effect on meiosis ( Sarkar et al . 2013 ) . Our find - ings are consistent with this observation and further indi - cate that successful meiosis relies on the integrity of Box 1 in all copies of Dsn1 . These findings strongly sug - gest that the interaction between Dsn1 Box 1 and the conserved hydrophobic cavity on Csm1 , as captured in the crystal structure of Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Cg Dsn1 14 – 72 ( Fig . 5a ) , is important for kinetochore monoorientation in vivo . Regional - centromere fungi utilise Dsn1 Box 1 for Csm1 binding Dsn1 - N / Box 1 is widely conserved among eukaryotes ( Fig . 1 ) , including in S . pombe where the monopolin subunits Csm1 and Mde4 are important for mitotic chromosome segregation , but dispensable for sister monoorientation in meiosis I ( Gregan et al . 2007 ; Choi et al . 2009 ) ( Fig . 6a ; S2a , b ) . The wide con - servation of Dsn1 - N / Box 1 suggests that it may be an ancestral monopolin - binding motif that recruits the complex to the kinet - ochore , potentially through an interface like that in our structure of Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Cg Dsn1 14 – 72 ( Fig . 6b ) . Supporting this idea , we have previously shown that S . pombe Csm1 ( also called Pcs1 ) interacts with Dsn1 ( Mis13 ) through its C - terminal glob - ular domain , and that mutations to the conserved hydrophobic cavity of S . pombe Csm1 disrupt this interaction ( Corbett et al . 2010 ) . We used a fluorescence polarisation binding assay to test whether a peptide encoding Sp Dsn1 - N / Box 1 ( residues 5 – 17 ) is sufficient for Csm1 binding , and measured robust binding with a K d of 22 μ M ( Fig . 6c ) . This binding was eliminated when we mutated Sp Csm1 isoleucine 241 , located in the hy - drophobic cavity , to aspartate ( Fig . 6b ) . Sp Csm1 I241 is equiv - alent to Sc Csm1 L161 , mutation of which we previously showed disrupts binding to Csm1 ( Corbett et al . 2010 ) . To further characterise this interaction , we used an in vitro pulldown assay to systematically test the importance of Chromosoma conserved residues in Sp Dsn1 - N / Box 1 ( Fig . 6d ) . We found that Csm1 binding was disrupted upon mutation of the central hydrophobic residues ( F11 and F13 ) , upstream negatively charged residues ( E6 and E9 ) , and downstream positively charged residues ( R15 and K18 ) . These data agree closely with our structure of the Cg Csm1 : Dsn1 - N / Box 1 interface , and strongly suggest that in S . pombe , Dsn1N / Box 1 is primarily responsible for interactions with the Csm1 : Lrs4 ( Pcs1 : Mde4 ) complex . Given the high conservation of Dsn1 - N / Box 1 in all eukaryotes that possess Csm1 orthologs ( Fig . 1 ) , we propose that Dsn1 - N / Box 1 comprises the ancestral , universal receptor for Csm1 , while Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 evolved with monopolin ’ s mei - otic roles in budding yeast . Dsn1 Box 1 and Box 3 perform independent roles in meiosis We found that key residues in both Box 1 and Box 3 are important for sister kinetochore monoorientation and success - ful meiosis ( Figs . 4 , 5 ) . While the full Dsn1 Box 1 - 2 - 3 region ( residues 71 – 110 ) binds robustly to Csm1 in vitro , neither Dsn1 Box 1 ( residues 71 – 80 ) or Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 ( residues 80 – 110 ) alone bound strongly in this assay ( Fig . 7a ) . These findings suggest that robust Csm1 binding relies on the integ - rity of both Box 1 and Box 3 . Consistently , point mutations in either Box 1 ( residues L72 and F74 ) or Box 3 ( V104 and F107 ) strongly reduced Csm1 binding in vitro ( Fig . 2f ) .

Spore viability of diploid strains with the indicated genotypes were analysed as described in Fig . 3b .

Data for wild type and no tag is reproduced from Fig . 4d . Other strains used were AMy25618 ( DSN1 - L72A F74A ) and AMy26543 ( DSN1 - L72D F72D ) and the average of 3 or 5 biological replicates , respectively , is shown with standard error bars Chromosoma However , neither set of mutations affected spore viability as severely as deletion of MAM1 or heterozygous truncation of the first 78 ( removing Box 1 ) or 110 ( removing Box 1 - 2 - 3 ) residues of Dsn1 ( Fig . 7b ) . These data raise the possibility that Dsn1 Box 1 and Box 3 could act at least partially redundantly in vivo . To determine whether this is the case , we combined Dsn1 mutations with alanine substitutions in the hydrophobic residues of Box 1 or Box 3 and the putative phosphorylation sites S109 / S110 to generate Dsn1 - L72A / L74A / V104A / F107A , Dsn1 - L72A / L74A / S109A / S110A , and Dsn1 L72A / L74A / V104A / F107A / S109A / S110A . Interestingly , spore viability after meiosis where one copy of Dsn1 carries mutations in both Box 1 and Box 3 was comparable to that of strains with Dsn1 N - terminal truncations ( Δ 78 and Δ 110 ) , whether the N terminus of Dsn1 from the other allele was intact or not ( Fig . 7b ) . These results show that while the in - tegrity of both Dsn1 Box 1 and Box 3 is required for robust Csm1 binding in vitro and functional monoorientation in vivo , they also have at least partially independent roles in meiosis . Discussion The V - shaped monopolin complex performs multiple roles in kinetochore and chromosome biology , which are likely to be achieved through its ability to act as a molecular crosslinker . This activity is mediated by bind - ing of the two Csm1 homodimer heads , one at each apex of the V , to short peptide motifs on target molecules to be linked together . Our previous work had identified a conserved hydrophobic cavity on the Csm1 homodimer that is important to target monopolin both to the nucle - olus and to kinetochores ( Corbett et al . 2010 ) , and a second surface important for binding additional partner proteins in both contexts ( Corbett and Harrison 2012 ; Liang et al . 2017 ) . Here , we defined the molecular inter - actions between Csm1 and its kinetochore receptor , Dsn1 . We unexpectedly identify two mutually exclusive modes for Dsn1 - Csm1 binding , in which the same hy - drophobic cavity in Csm1 can interact with distinct con - served motifs in the Dsn1 N - terminal region ( Box 1 and Box 2 - 3 , respectively ) . Through cell biological and bio - chemical studies using specific mutations ( see Table 1 for summary of mutant characterisation ) , we demonstrate that both binding modes are important for sister kineto - chore monoorientation during meiosis I in vivo . While Box 1 is the ancestral monopolin receptor at kineto - chores , Box 2 - 3 is conserved only in yeast with point centromeres that use monopolin to direct sister kineto - chore monoorientation during meiosis I . c d Box 1 M i s 13 1 - 100 K 2 A R 3 A K 4 A E 6 A Q 8 A E 9 A F 11 A F 13 A V 14 A R 15 A K 16 A K 18 A E 19 A Load ( 10 % ) Pulldown : His 6 - Sp Csm1 125 - 261 E30 ( E9 ) R37 ( R15 ) F34 ( F13 ) F32 ( F11 ) E30 ( E9 ) R37 ( R15 ) L159 ( I241 ) F34 ( F13 ) F32 ( F11 ) Cg Csm1 Cg Dsn1 29 - 38 L159 ( I241 ) a b 0 50 100 150 200 250 50 75 100 125 150 Sp Csm1 WT Sp Csm1 I241D P o l a r i z a t i on ( m P ) [ protein ] ( µ M ) Sp Csm1 125 - 261 binding Sp Mis13 5 - 17 C . glabrata / S . pombe C . glabrata / S . pombe Numbering : Numbering : Req . for Csm1 binding ( D ) Fig . 6 S . pombe Mis13 binds Csm1 through a Dsn1 - N / Box 1 motif . a Sequence alignment of the Cg Dsn1 Box 1 region with the N - terminal region of S . pombe Mis13 ( See Fig .

The Csm1 I241D mutant mimics the S . cerevisiae L161D mutant , known to disrupt binding of Dsn1 in vitro ( Corbett et al . 2010 ) by disrupting the conserved hydrophobic cavity ( L159 in Cg Csm1 ; see panel B ) ; d Ni 2 + - pulldown of in vitro translated S . pombe Mis13 N - terminal region ( wild type and mutants ) by His 6 - Csm1 125 – 261 . Mis13 residues whose mutation to alanine disrupts Csm1 binding are marked by asterisks in panel a Chromosoma Dsn1 - N / Box 1 — the ancestral monopolin recruiter Although Mam1 orthologs appear to be present only in bud - ding yeast with point centromeres , we identify Csm1 orthologs in a wide range of eukaryotes where they are likely to function at the kinetochore . In the fission yeast S . pombe , Csm1 and Mde4 ( Lrs4 ) associate with kinetochores during mitosis where they prevent merotelic kinetochore - microtubule attachments ( Gregan et al . 2007 ) . In budding yeast mitosis , Csm1 and Lrs4 associate with kinetochores in anaphase , independently of Mam1 ( Brito et al . 2010 ) . Knockout of the Arabidopsis thaliana ortholog of Csm1 ( Titan - 9 ) results in the classic titan phenotype leading to prob - lems in endosperm development and thus suggesting a role in meiosis ( Tzafrir et al . 2002 ; Tzafrir et al . 2004 ) . Lastly , the highly divergent Csm1 ortholog in Dictyostelium discoideum , named Cenp - 68 , was found to be involved in associating clus - tered kinetochores to the spindle pole body - like structure dur - ing interphase ( Schulz et al . 2009 ) . Altogether , these studies indicate that Csm1 is in some way involved in bridging kinet - ochores during mitosis or meiosis . Strikingly however , Csm1 has been lost in most metazoans , except for the early - branching lineages Nematostella vectensis and Amphimedon queenslandica . Our identification of Csm1 orthologs outside fungi suggest that these organisms share a conserved monopolin interaction motif in the kinetochore . Consistent with this idea , our se - quence alignments revealed that Dsn1 - N / Box 1 is broadly conserved in eukaryotes and co - evolves with Csm1 ( Fig . 1 , S1 , S2 ) . In our structure of Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Cg Dsn1 14 – 72 , we found that Dsn1 Box 1 forms an interaction motif that associ - ates with the Csm1 hydrophobic cavity ( Fig . 5a ) . Mutation of two conserved hydrophobic residues that extend into the con - served Csm1 hydrophobic cavity ( L72 and F74 in S . cerevisiae ) resulted in loss of Mam1 from kinetochores during meiosis I , a failure to properly monoorient kineto - chores , and a resultant loss of spore viability ( Fig . 5 ) . This demonstrates that Dsn1 Box 1 interaction with Csm1 is critical for sister kinetochore monoorientation during meiosis I . Supporting the idea that S . pombe monopolin uses a similar interaction mechanism for its recruitment to kinetochores , we find that the isolated Dsn1 - N / Box 1 region from Sp Dsn1 ( called Mis13 ) binds Csm1 via its conserved hydrophobic cavity ( Fig . 6c ) , and that the mutation of conserved residues in Sp Dsn1 - N / Box 1 disrupt binding to Csm1 ( Fig . 6d ) . Taken together , these data provide a strong argument that the Dsn1 - N / Box 1 represents an ancestral docking site for monopolin at kinetochores . Curiously , however , we observed no strong ef - fects on mitotic chromosome segregation upon mutation of residues in Dsn1 Box 1 ( Fig . S8b ) , consistent with a previous analysis of DSN1 - Δ 110 ( Sarkar et al . 2013 ) . Nevertheless , in S . cerevisiae , both Csm1 and Lrs4 are found at kinetochores during mitotic anaphase ( Brito et al . 2010 ) and testing the requirement for Dsn1 Box 1 in this recruitment will be an important future priority . Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 — an adaptation to meiotic function The Dsn1 - N / Box 1 - Csm1 interaction likely represents a gen - eral mechanism whereby monopolin can be recruited to kinet - ochores , but our data show that this motif on its own is insuf - ficient for sister kinetochore monoorientation during meiosis I . Instead , both the Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 region and the presence of Mam1 ( and by extension Hrr25 ) are additionally required for sister monoorientation . Structurally , Dsn1 Box 3 binds the same hydrophobic cavity on Csm1 to Dsn1 Box 1 , only in the opposite orientation , with the Box 2 α - helix packing onto the side of the Csm1 homodimer . The structure of the Csm1 : Dsn1 Box 3 region is also strikingly similar to that of Csm1 : Tof2 ( Fig . S9 ) , which recruits Csm1 to the nucleolus to regulate ribosomal DNA silencing and recombination ( Liang et al . 2017 ) . Both Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 and Tof2 insert a pair of hydrophobic residues into the Csm1 hydrophobic cavity , and both possess a pair of positively charged residues immediately N - terminal to the hydrophobic residues . Instead of two highly conserved serine residues as in Dsn1 , however , Tof2 possesses a pair of conserved negatively charged residues that interact with the conserved lysine residues on Csm1 ( Fig . S9 ) . Thus , Csm1 interacts with diverse partners in the nucleolus and at kinetochores using similar mechanisms . While a Csm1 homodimer possesses two identical con - served hydrophobic cavities capable of binding either Dsn1 Box 1 or Box 3 , the orientation of the two binding modes and the proximity of Dsn1 Box 1 and Box 2 - 3 mean that it is impossible for a single Dsn1 protomer to simultaneously inter - act with Csm1 through both binding modes ( Fig . S6a ) . Since the conserved Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 region is specifically found in budding yeast with point centromeres and Mam1 homologs , it is likely that Csm1 binding by Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 is specifically important for sister kinetochore monoorientation . Indeed , our mutational analysis of Dsn1 Box 3 provides evidence that this is the case ( Fig . 4 ) . These observations predict the existence of meiosis I - specific mechanisms that enable Csm1 - Lrs4 to en - gage with Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 and thereby fuse kinetochores . How might this be controlled ? An attractive possibility is that this is the function of the Mam1 - Hrr25 module of monopolin . We previously showed that Mam1 associates with the Csm1 globular domain , and links Hrr25 to monopolin through a flexible tether ( Corbett and Harrison 2012 ; Ye et al . 2016 ) . In the crystal structure of Sc Csm1 : Mam1 , Mam1 forms an ex - tended interface with Csm1 that includes an α - helix binding to the B side ^ of Csm1 and a phenylalanine residue ( Sc Mam1 F262 ) inserted into the conserved hydrophobic cavity of Csm1 ( Corbett and Harrison 2012 ) . As these data are difficult to reconcile with our finding that Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 interacts with the same surfaces on Csm1 , we determined a new crystal Chromosoma structure of a Cg Csm1 69 – 181 : Mam1 162 – 216 complex ( Fig . S4 ) . This structure closely resembles our earlier structure of the S . cerevisiae complex , but does not include an ordered α - helix or any interaction with the Csm1 hydrophobic cavity . Closer inspection of sequence conservation in Mam1 orthologs reveals very poor conservation beyond the B core ^ region of Mam1 that interacts with Csm1 in our new structure , suggesting that the additional interactions observed in our earlier structure of the S . cerevisiae complex represented non - specific crystal packing interactions rather than a biolog - ically relevant interface . Thus , our new structural data support the idea that Mam1 and Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 can bind simultaneous - ly to a Csm1 protomer , rather than competing for Csm1 bind - ing ( Fig . S4d ) . Interestingly , our structural modelling suggests that Mam1 is positioned close to the solvent - exposed residues on the Dsn1 Box 2 α - helix ( Fig . S4d ) , suggesting a potential further interaction that could stabilise the ternary complex and explain the role of these residues in Dsn1 Box 2 ( Fig . 3 ) . 71 - 80 80 - 11071 - 110 Input ( 10 % ) Pulldown : No bait Pulldown : His 6 - Csm1 69 - 190 MBP - Dsn1 a c Box 1 Box 1 Csm1 homodimer Box 1 Box 3 Box 2 Mam1 Hrr25 kinase Box 1 Box 1 Box 1 Box 3 Box 2 Dsn1 ( 1 ) Unstable - Box 1 ( 2 ) Stable - Box 2 - 3 SWITCH S109 / S110 phosphorylation ( 3 ) Sister kinetochore monoorientation + / L 7 2 / F 7 4 + / V 1 0 4 / F 1 0 7 A + / S 1 0 9 / S 1 1 0 A + / L 7 2 / F 7 4 A S 1 0 9 / S 1 1 0 A + / L 7 2 / F 7 4 A V 1 0 4 / F 1 0 7 A + / L 7 2 / F 7 4 A V 1 0 4 / F 1 0 7 A S 1 0 9 / S 1 1 0 A + / ∆ B o x 1 - D S N 1 + / ∆ B o x 1 2 3 - D S N 1 B o x 1 B o x 3 ∆ B o x 1 2 3 - D S N 1 / ∆ B o x 1 2 3 - D S N 1 ∆ B o x 1 2 3 - D S N 1 / L 7 2 / F 7 4 A S 1 0 9 / S 1 1 0 A ∆ B o x 1 2 3 - D S N 1 / L 7 2 / F 7 4 A V 1 0 4 / F 1 0 7 A ∆ B o x 1 2 3 - D S N 1 / L 7 2 / F 7 4 A V 1 0 4 / F 1 0 7 A S 1 0 9 / S 1 1 0 A 0 1 3 2 4 viable spores per tetrad w il d t y p e M A M 1 + / m a m 1 ∆ m a m 1 ∆ / m a m 1 ∆ % m e i o s e s 0 20 40 60 80 100 b sisterssisters sister kinetochores 11 MIND / Mis12c Ndc80c Ctf19c / CCAN 2 Mif2 - N Monopolin Dsn1 - N Microtubule Dsn1 - C 3 Chromosoma Taken together , our structural and functional data sug - gest the following general model for monopolin function at meiosis I kinetochores ( Fig . 7c ) : The monopolin complex may first be recruited to kinetochores through an unstable interaction between Csm1 and the ancestral Box 1 motif on the Dsn1 N - terminus . Initial binding may be non - specific , with the two Csm1 homodimer B heads ^ interacting with Dsn1 protomers either within a single kinetochore , between sister kinetochores , or between non - sister kinetochores . We hypothesise that sister kinetochore binding by the two Csm1 heads could trigger a switch in interaction mode between Box 1 and Box 2 - 3 , with further stabilisation of the Box 2 - 3 interaction coming through phosphorylation of the two conserved serine residues in Box 3 ( Sc Dsn1 S109 and S110 ) . Although the relevant kinase has yet to be iden - tified , we note that Mam1 ideally positions Hrr25 to access Dsn1 , and we have previously shown that Hrr25 phosphor - ylates Dsn1 in vitro , most likely in its disordered N - terminal region ( Ye et al . 2016 ) . While we did not identify specific phosphorylation sites within Dsn1 , we speculate that Hrr25 may phosphorylate Dsn1 S109 / S110 to stabilise monopolin - kinetochore binding . Testing the role of Hrr25 , and identifying how sister kinetochore binding by the monopolin complex might be sensed , are important ques - tions for future work . An interesting feature of mutations in the Dsn1 Box 1 - 2 - 3 region is that they impair sister kinetochore monoorientation in a dominant fashion when heterozygous , despite the pres - ence of an estimated 6 – 7 copies of Dsn1 at each kinetochore ( Joglekar et al . 2006 ; Dimitrova et al . 2016 ) . One explanation for this finding is that robust sister monoorientation relies on every copy of Dsn1 being able to associate with Csm1 through both identified binding modes , perhaps because each individual Csm1 - Dsn1 interaction is relatively weak . A sec - ond possibility is that the level of Hrr25 activity at kineto - chores is important , and reduced binding of monopolin in heterozygous DSN1 mutant strains leads to a reduction in Hrr25 activity , and a consequent reduction in the efficiency of sister kinetochore monoorientation and successful meiosis . Monopolin — a general - purpose molecular crosslinker While the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying specific sister kinetochore crosslinking by monopolin remain un - known , the data we present here essentially complete the structural picture of how the monopolin complex is assembled and how it interacts with kinetochores in meiosis I . When considered alongside our extensive prior structural analysis of the monopolin complex and its interactions with various binding partners , a picture emerges of a complex that is strik - ingly flexible in its ability to scaffold important architectural and signalling complexes in S . cerevisiae . The V - shaped Csm1 - Lrs4 complex has two Csm1 homodimer heads posi - tioned ~ 10 nm apart , and each Csm1 homodimer head pos - sesses four protein - protein interaction surfaces : two conserved hydrophobic cavities , and two binding sites for Mam1 / Ulp2 - like molecules . In the nucleolus , Csm1 binds Tof2 via the conserved hydrophobic cavity , in the process likely crosslinking multiple copies of the repetitive rDNA to sup - press illegitimate recombination , and aiding Sir2 - dependent transcriptional silencing ( Huang et al . 2006 ; Mekhail et al . 2008 ; Corbett et al . 2010 ; Liang et al . 2017 ) . At the same time , Csm1 binds Ulp2 which deSUMOylates and stabilises other key rDNA - silencing proteins ( Liang et al . 2017 ) . At the kinet - ochore , Csm1 binds both Dsn1 Box 1 and Box 3 via the hydrophobic cavity to directly crosslink sister kinetochores , and also binds Mam1 to indirectly recruit Hrr25 . Finally , we have recently identified another Csm1 binding partner , Dse3 , whose biological functions are not known but that binds Csm1 in a Ulp2 / Mam1 - like manner ( Singh and Corbett 2018 ) . This constellation of monopolin - interacting proteins may not yet be complete , with the Saccharomyces Genome Database ( http : / / yeastgenome . org ) listing 70 proteins as identified physical interactors of Csm1 alone ( Singh and Corbett 2018 ) . Thus , the monopolin complex represents a remarkably versatile mo - lecular crosslinker that has been recruited into at least three , and potentially more , functional roles in budding yeast .  Fig . 7 Dsn1 Box 1 and Box 3 perform independent roles in meiosis . a Ni 2 + - pulldown of in vitro translated S . cerevisiae Dsn1 N - terminal region constructs ( fused to an N - terminal maltose binding protein tag ) by Sc His 6 - Csm1 69 – 190 ; b Combination of Box 1 and Box 3 mutations lead to an additive effect on meiosis .

Other diploids were generated from matings between AMy17232 and AMy1827 ( heterozygous Δ 78 - DSN1 ) , AMy17230 and AMy1827 ( Δ 110 - DSN1 ) , AMy17505 and AMy17507 ( homozygous Δ 110 - DSN1 ) , AMy1828 and AMy26727 ( wild type and DSN1 - L72A F74AV104A F107A ) , AMy1828 and AMy25883 ( wild type and DSN1 - L72A F74A S109A S110A ) , AMy1828 and AMy26728 ( wild type and L72A F74A V104A F107A S109A S110A ) ; AMy17505 and AMy26727 ( Δ 110 - DSN1 and DSN1 - L72A F74A V104A F107A ) , AMy17505 and AMy25883 ( Δ 110 - DSN1 and DSN1 - L72A F74A S109A S110A ) , AMy17505 and AMy26728 ( Δ 110 - DSN1 and L72A F74A V104A F107A S109A S110A ) . Data for DSN1 - L72A F74A , DSN1 - V104A F107A , and DSN1 - S109A S110A is reproduced from Fig . 3b and 4b ; c Model for sister kinetochore monoorientation by the monopolin complex . Initial unstable kinetochore association of the monopolin complex ( 1 ) occurs via Dsn1 Box 1 ( yellow ) . While initial binding is non - specific , association of a single complex with sister kinetochores triggers a switch to a more stable binding mode ( 2 ) involving Dsn1 Box 2 - 3 ( orange ) . The association is further stabilised by phosphorylation of Dsn1 S109 / S110 by Hrr25 or another kinase , resulting in stable sister kinetochore monoorientation ( 3 ) . While we draw a single Dsn1 interacting with each globular head of the monopolin complex , each head possesses two conserved hydrophobic cavities and therefore could bind two copies of Dsn1 Chromosoma T a b l e 1 S u mm a r y o f D s n1 m u t a n t ph e no t yp e s P o s iti on o f m u t a ti on C s m 1 b i nd i ng t o D s n1 i n v it r o 1 S po r e v i a b ilit y h e t e r o z ygou s m u t a ti on ( % ) 2 S po r e v i a b ilit y ho m o z ygou s m u t a ti on ( % ) 3 S i s t e r c h r o m a ti d c o - s e g r e g a ti on i n m e i o s i s I ( % ) 4 C e n t r o m e r i c M a m 1 e n r i c h m e n t ( r e l a ti v e t o w il d t yp e ) 5 W il d t yp e 97 1 1 . 00 L 72 A F 74 A B ox 1 hyd r ophob i c - 68 47 37 0 . 26 L 72 D F 74 D - - 63 61 27 0 . 24 L 88 A L 92 A L 95 A B ox 2 ou t w a r d f ac i ng h e li x - 81 18 L 88 D L 92 D L 95 D - L 88 K L 92 K L 95 K - - E 90 A N 94 A D 97 A B ox 2 i n w a r d f ac i ng h e li x + + 98 0 E 90 K N 94 K D 97 K + 93 79 13 V 104 A F 107 A B ox 3 hyd r ophob i c - - 69 46 41 0 . 25 V 104 D F 107 D - - 68 57 57 0 . 12 S 109 A S 110 A B ox 3 c on s e r v e d doub l e s e r i n e 88 86 12 0 . 23 S 109 R S 110 R 76 13 S 109 D S 110 D + + 97 97 2 0 . 80 1 D a t a fr o m F i g . 1 e .
