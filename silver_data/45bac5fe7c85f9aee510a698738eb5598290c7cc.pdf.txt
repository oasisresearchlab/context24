Moolenaar ` ABSTRACT Chloride intracellular channel protein 4 ( CLIC4 ) exists in both soluble and membrane - associated forms , and is implicated in diverse cellular processes , ranging from ion channel formation to intracellular membrane remodeling . CLIC4 is rapidly recruited to the plasma membrane by lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) and serum , suggesting a possible role for CLIC4 in exocytic – endocytic trafficking . However , the function and subcellular target ( s ) of CLIC4 remain elusive . Here , we show that in HeLa and MDA - MB - 231 cells , CLIC4 knockdown decreases cell – matrix adhesion , cell spreading and integrin signaling , whereas it increases cell motility . LPA stimulates the recruitment of CLIC4 to b 1 integrin at the plasma membrane and in Rab35 - positive endosomes . CLIC4 is required for both the internalization and the serum - or LPA - induced recycling of b 1 integrin , but not for EGF receptor trafficking . Furthermore , we show that CLIC4 suppresses Rab35 activity and antagonizes Rab35 - dependent regulation of b 1 integrin trafficking . Our results define CLIC4 as a regulator of Rab35 activity and serum - and LPA - dependent integrin trafficking . KEY WORDS : CLIC4 , Cell adhesion , Integrin trafficking , Lysophosphatidic acid , Rab35 INTRODUCTION The chloride intracellular channel ( CLIC ) protein family consists of six members ( CLIC1 – CLIC6 ) that are structurally related to the omega class of glutathione S - transferases ( GSTs ) , but appear to have distinct cellular functions ( Dulhunty et al . , 2001 ; Harrop et al . , 2001 ; Jiang et al . , 2014 ; Littler et al . , 2005 ; Littler et al . , 2010 ) . CLICs are globular proteins that are highly conserved among vertebrates and exist in both soluble and membrane - associated forms . They have been implicated in membrane remodeling , intracellular trafficking , vacuole formation , actin reorganization , ion transport and other processes ( for a review , see Jiang et al . , 2014 ; Littler et al . , 2010 ) . Gene targeting studies in mice have begun to reveal essential , non - redundant physiological roles of the CLIC proteins , including in platelet and macrophage function ( Jiang et al . , 2012 ; Qiu et al . , 2010 ) , hearing ( Gagnon et al . , 2006 ) , angiogenesis and wound healing ( Padmakumar et al . , 2012 ; Ulmasov et al . , 2009 ) . In Caenorhabditis elegans , disruption of the CLIC homolog EXC - 4 dramatically impairs formation and maintenance of the intracellular excretory tube , but vertebrate CLICs cannot rescue the phenotype , indicating that vertebrate and invertebrate CLICs have distinct functions ( Berry et al . , 2003 ; Berry and Hobert , 2006 ) . Among the six mammalian CLIC proteins , CLIC4 is the best - studied family member , yet its precise function ( s ) and regulation are still largely unknown . CLIC4 is ubiquitously expressed and detected in the cytosol as a diffusible protein , but it can also localize to intracellular vesicles , organelles and actin - based structures ( Berryman and Goldenring , 2003 ; Chuang et al . , 1999 ; Chuang et al . , 2010 ) and even to the nucleus ( Shukla et al . , 2009 ; Suh et al . , 2007 ) . Growing evidence points to a role for CLIC4 in such diverse processes as angiogenesis , differentiation , migration and wound healing . Thus , Clic4 2 / 2 mice display defective angiogenesis and vacuolization ( Ulmasov et al . , 2009 ) as well as spontaneous skin erosions and impaired wound healing , apparently due to defects in cell adhesion ( Padmakumar et al . , 2012 ) . However , the underlying mechanism is unknown . Cell adhesion is mediated by integrins , heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that link the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton . Integrins undergo endocytic – exocytic trafficking , both constitutively and in a stimulus - dependent manner . Integrin endocytic recycling is key to the regulation of cell adhesion , spreading and migration ( Bridgewater et al . , 2012 ; Caswell et al . , 2009 ; Margadant et al . , 2011 ; Pellinen and Ivaska , 2006 ) . We previously identified CLIC4 as a new player in a signaling pathway initiated by G - protein - coupled receptor agonists , in particular the lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) ( Ponsioen et al . , 2009 ) . LPA is a major serum constituent ( Eichholtz et al . , 1993 ) and many cellular responses to serum are in fact attributable to LPA receptor stimulation ( Moolenaar et al . , 2004 ) . Using N1E - 115 neuroblastoma cells as a model , we showed that CLIC4 undergoes rapid but transient translocation from the cytosol to distinct regions of the plasma membrane upon LPA or serum stimulation , in a manner strictly dependent on RhoA activity and F - actin integrity ( Ponsioen et al . , 2009 ) . This observation raises the possibility that CLIC4 functions in a regulated exocytic – endocytic trafficking route ; however , very little is known about the rapid agonist - induced recruitment of CLIC4 to the plasma membrane . In the present study , we set out to examine the function and LPA - induced redistribution of CLIC4 in HeLa and MDA - MB - 231 carcinoma cells , focusing on cell adhesion and integrin behavior . We find that CLIC4 is required for integrin - mediated cell adhesion , and that LPA stimulates the recruitment of CLIC4 to b 1 integrin at the plasma membrane and in Rab35 - positive endosomes . CLIC4 stimulates both the internalization and serum / LPA - induced recycling of b 1 integrin . Furthermore , CLIC4 suppresses Rab35 activity , and antagonizes Rab35 - dependent regulation of integrin trafficking . We conclude that CLIC4 is a new player in the agonist - regulated trafficking of b 1 integrin .

CLIC4 - depleted cells were obtained using lentiviral vectors containing different small hairpin RNAs ( shRNAs ) against CLIC4 ( denoted shCLIC4 ) . We raised a CLIC4 - specific polyclonal antibody ( Fig . 1A ) , and confirmed stable CLIC4 knockdown by western blotting and quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) . Among five distinct shRNAs tested , shCLIC4 ( # 3 ) and shCLIC4 ( # 5 ) were the most effective ( Fig . 1B , C ; and data not shown ) . CLIC4 knockdown did not affect the rate of cell proliferation , nor did it modulate EGF - or LPA - induced activation of ERK1 / 2 ( also known as MAPK3 and MAPK1 , respectively ) and AKT1 ( supplementary material Fig . S1 ) , indicating that CLIC4 has no direct role in mitogenic signaling . Furthermore , CLIC4 - depleted cells showed RhoA - mediated cytoskeletal contraction and developed stress fibers upon LPA stimulation , similar to control cells , which argues against a role for CLIC4 in actin remodeling ( results not shown ; see also Ponsioen et al . , 2009 ) . When assessing cell morphology and adhesion , however , we observed that CLIC4 - depleted cells consistently appeared less well spread ( at 24 h after plating ) and adhered less efficiently to the plates than did control cells , suggesting a defect in integrin function . We therefore focused our studies on the role of CLIC4 in cell – matrix adhesion and integrin function . CLIC4 regulates integrin - dependent cell adhesion , motility and focal adhesion assembly We first determined the level of adhesion of CLIC4 - depleted and control cells ( containing empty vector ) to the integrin - binding substrates collagen - I and fibronectin , at 30 min after plating in serum - free medium . As shown in Fig . 1D , CLIC4 - depleted HeLa and MDA - MB - 231 cells , containing either shCLIC4 ( # 3 ) or shCLIC4 ( # 5 ) , adhered less well to these substrates . To rescue this phenotype , HeLa cells containing shCLIC4 ( # 3 ) were transiently transfected with either an shRNA - resistant mouse version of CLIC4 ( GFP – mCLIC4 ) or mCherry alone ( Fig . 1E , left panel ) , mixed in a 1 : 1 ratio , and seeded on collagen - coated surfaces . Expression of GFP – mCLIC4 rescued cell adhesion to collagen - I , as quantified by counting the number of red and green cells ( Fig . 1E , middle panel ) . Cell adhesion to fibronectin was similarly rescued ( Fig . 1E , right panel ) . We next examined how the reduced cell – matrix adhesion of the CLIC4 - depleted cells affected cell motility by using time - lapse video microscopy . Under serum - free conditions , CLIC4 - depleted MDA - MB - 231 cells migrated significantly faster than control cells on collagen - I , consistent with reduced cell adhesion . LPA , an established motility factor , enhanced the random motility of control cells , but not that of CLIC4 - depleted cells ( Fig . 1F , left panel ) . LPA did not affect cell directionality in either control or CLIC4 - depleted cells ( Fig . 1F , right panel ) . Taken together , these results suggest that CLIC4 depletion leads to maximal cell motility , rendering the cells unresponsive to further stimulation by LPA . Integrin - ligand binding leads to focal adhesion formation , protein phosphorylation and cell spreading ( Geiger and Yamada , 2011 ) . At 1 h after plating on collagen - I or fibronectin in serum - free medium , CLIC4 - depleted HeLa cells appeared less spread than control cells ( Fig . 2A , B and Fig . 2E , F , respectively ) . Vinculin staining of spreading cells revealed that shCLIC4 cells had reduced focal adhesion size and number when compared to cells containing control shRNA ( denoted shControl ) , indicative of impaired focal adhesion assembly ( Fig . 2A , C , D and Fig . 2E , G , H on collagen - I or fibronectin , respectively ) . We measured the autophosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK , also known as PTK2 ) on residue Y397 ( FAK - pY397 ) , a well - established readout of integrin signaling ( Parsons , 2003 ) . Upon plating on either collagen - I or fibronectin , HeLa cells showed an increase in FAK - pY397 levels over time , with a maximum reached at , 60 min after seeding . CLIC4 - depleted cells showed significantly less FAK - pY397 under similar conditions ( Fig . 2I , J ) , consistent with reduced focal adhesion assembly and cell spreading . From these results , we conclude that CLIC4 is required for the regulation of integrin - mediated events , notably cell – matrix adhesion , cell spreading , focal adhesion assembly and cell motility . LPA stimulation recruits CLIC4 to b 1 integrin We have previously reported that CLIC4 undergoes rapid but transient translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane upon LPA or serum stimulation in various cell types , including N1E - 115 , A431 and HeLa cells ( Ponsioen et al . , 2009 ) . Given the apparent role of CLIC4 in integrin - mediated processes , we examined whether CLIC4 is recruited to integrins at the plasma membrane upon LPA stimulation . We focused on the ubiquitously expressed b 1 integrin , which mediate adhesion to collagens and fibronectin . We examined the localization of CLIC4 and the integrin b 1 subunit in both serum - starved and LPA - stimulated HeLa cells by super - resolution microscopy , using the ground - state depletion imaging method ( Fo¨lling et al . , 2008 ) . This technique offers exceptional optical resolution down to , 10 nm , allowing us to obtain dual - color super - resolution images of GFP – CLIC4 and the integrin b 1 subunit in total internal reflection fluorescence mode . In serum - starved cells , CLIC4 distribution was mainly cytosolic , whereas b 1 integrin was mainly found at the plasma membrane , although some CLIC4 – integrin - b 1 colocalization was also observed ( Fig . 3A ) . Following stimulation with 1 - oleoyl - LPA ( 1 m M ; 2 min ) , significantly more CLIC4 was detected at the plasma membrane , where it prominently colocalized with b 1 integrin ; enhanced CLIC4 – integrin - b 1 colocalization was also detected in intracellular compartments ( Fig . 3A , B ) . Of note , the internal b 1 integrin pool that colocalized with CLIC4 was predominantly in the active conformation , as shown by using an antibody that recognizes active b 1 integrin only ( Fig . 3C ) . LPA - induced colocalization of CLIC4 and b 1 integrin was confirmed by electron microscopy using gold - labeled ultra - thin sections of LPA - treated MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Fig . 3D ) . These results show that LPA stimulation recruits CLIC4 to b 1 integrin , both at the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments . CLIC4 regulates integrin internalization , and LPA - and serum - induced recycling To investigate how CLIC4 recruitment to b 1 integrin might affect integrin - b 1 - mediated cell adhesion , we determined integrin expression under steady - state conditions . Through flow cytometry and western blotting , we established that CLIC4 depletion did not affect the cell surface expression of b 1 integrin or other b - and a - subunits ( Fig . 4A ; supplementary material Table S1 ) , nor did it affect the levels of the precursor and mature forms of b 1 integrin ( Fig . 4B ) . Thus , the observed effects of CLIC4 silencing on cell adhesion are not simply due to differences in integrin expression .

Integrin recycling is controlled by serum and LPA ( White et al . , 2007 ) , and LPA stimulation recruits CLIC4 to integrins both at the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments ( Fig . 3 ) . We therefore examined whether depletion of CLIC4 might affect the trafficking of b 1 integrin , using confocal microscopy , biochemical assays and flow cytometry . We first employed an antibody - based assay , in which shControl and shCLIC4 HeLa and MDA - MB - 231 were incubated with anti - b 1 - integrin antibody ( TS2 / 16 ) at 4 ˚ C . Thereafter , internalization of cell surface b 1 integrin was initiated by transfer to serum - free medium at 37 ˚ C Fig . 1 . CLIC4 knockdown affects cell adhesion and motility .

Recycling of internalized b 1 integrin was then induced by stimulation with serum . As shown in Fig . 5A , B ) , rapid recycling ( within 5 to 15 min ) of internalized b 1 integrin back to the plasma membrane occurred in control cells . In marked contrast , redistribution of the internal integrin pool to the plasma membrane was strongly reduced in CLIC4 - depleted cells , as quantified in Fig . 5C . Similar results were obtained using LPA alone ( data not shown ) . It thus appears that CLIC4 is important for the serum - and LPA - regulated , synchronized recycling of internalized b 1 integrin . To quantify this process , we measured integrin trafficking using a biotin - labeling and enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) protocol , focusing on integrin a 5 b 1 ( Roberts et al . , 2001 ) ( see Materials and Methods ) . Consistent with the above results , 55 % of the internalized integrin a 5 b 1 had already recycled back to the plasma membrane in control cells after 5 min of serum stimulation , whereas only 19 % had recycled in CLIC4 - depleted cells ( Fig . 6A ) . Recycling in the absence of CLIC4 was also reduced at later time points . In addition , reduced recycling of b 1 integrin in general was confirmed in a FACS - based assay , using an anti - b 1 antibody and two distinct shRNAs against CLIC4 ( supplementary material Fig . S2A ) . We also examined whether CLIC4 was required for integrin endocytosis by measuring the internalization of integrin a 5 b 1 , using the aforementioned biotin - labeling protocol followed by capture ELISA . We found that the pool of internalized integrin a 5 b 1 ( under serum - free conditions ) , as induced by a temperature shift from 4 ˚ C to 37 ˚ C , was reduced by , 50 % in CLIC4 - depleted cells ( Fig . 6B ; supplementary material Fig . S2B ) . Integrin internalization and subsequent sorting in the endosomal system determine the amount of integrin that is returned to the plasma membrane . It has recently become clear that b 1 integrin , in particular integrin a 5 b 1 , is sorted to late endosomes and lysosomes , much like growth factor receptors , and that the balance between recycling and internalization depends on sorting signals in the cytoplasmic tail of b 1 and ubiquitylation ( Bo¨ttcher et al . , 2012 ; Dozynkiewicz et al . , 2012 ; Lobert et al . , 2010 ; Margadant et al . , 2012 ; Steinberg et al . , 2012 ) . We therefore investigated whether the recycling defect in CLIC4 - knockdown cells led to increased degradation . Cell surface integrins were biotinylated , and subsequently the cells were incubated in complete medium to allow for internalization and recycling ( up to 6 h ) . Comparable to the turnover observed in other cell systems , more than 50 % of a 5 b 1 was degraded within 6 h . Similar kinetics of integrin degradation were observed in the CLIC4 - depleted cells ( Fig . 6C ) . Taken together , these results show that CLIC4 regulates both the constitutive endocytosis and the serum - and LPA - regulated recycling of b 1 integrin , without affecting integrin degradation . CLIC4 is not required for EGFR trafficking We next asked whether the effect of CLIC4 on integrin trafficking is specific . We focused on the EGF receptor ( EGFR ) , which has been shown to co - traffic with integrin a 5 b 1 ( Caswell et al . , 2008 ; Muller et al . , 2009 ) . As shown in Fig . 6D , CLIC4 depletion did not alter the steady - state levels of EGFR at the plasma membrane in Fig . 3 . LPA induces colocalization of CLIC4 with b 1 integrin .

Furthermore , CLIC4 silencing did not affect ligand - induced EGFR recycling , nor did it affect EGFR endocytosis , as measured by flow cytometry ( Sigismund et al . , 2008 ) ( Fig . 6E , F ) . After EGF stimulation , EGFR levels decreased over time , indicative of degradation , in a manner independent of CLIC4 ( Fig . 6G ) . It thus appears that CLIC4 is not required for ligand - induced trafficking and degradation of EGFR . On the basis of these results , we conclude that CLIC4 regulates the trafficking of b 1 integrin in a specific manner . CLIC4 colocalizes with b 1 integrin in early and Rab35 - positive endosomes Small GTPases of the Rab family are key regulators of membrane trafficking and define distinct populations of early , late and recycling endosomes . To identify the trafficking compartments where CLIC4 might meet b 1 integrin , we used several Rab GTPases as endosomal markers , as well as the Rab - 5 effector early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA - 1 ) , a marker of early endosomes , and lysosomal - associated membrane protein 1 ( LAMP1 ) , a marker for late endosomes and lysosomes . In GFP – CLIC4 - expressing HeLa cells , CLIC4 did not colocalize with Arf6 , Rab4a , Rab7 , Rab11A or LAMP1 , neither in serum - starved nor in serum - stimulated cells ( data not shown ) . However , a small subpopulation of CLIC4 was found to colocalize with b 1 integrin in EEA1 - positive early endosomes , consistent with the observed effect of CLIC4 on integrin endocytosis ( Fig . 7A ) . We next examined Rab35 , which has recently emerged as a regulator of endocytic recycling ( Allaire et al . , 2010 ; Allaire et al . , 2013 ; Chua et al . , 2010 ; Kouranti et al . , 2006 ) . In serum - starved HeLa cells , Rab35 was mostly found at the plasma membrane and , to a lesser extent , in intracellular compartments ( Fig . 7B ) . Some colocalization of CLIC4 and Rab35 was observed in non - stimulated cells . Upon LPA stimulation for 2 min , CLIC4 showed increased colocalization with Rab35 at the plasma membrane and in intracellular compartments that also contained b 1 integrin ( Fig . 7C ) . We conclude that LPA signaling promotes the recruitment of CLIC4 to b 1 integrin in Rab35 - positive compartments close to the plasma membrane . CLIC4 affects Rab35 activity To investigate the relationship between CLIC4 and Rab35 activity in b 1 integrin trafficking and LPA signaling , we Fig . 8 .

Immunoblot and qPCR analyses showed that Rab35 knockdown did not affect CLIC4 expression , and vice versa ( Fig . 8A , B ) . Furthermore , Rab35 depletion ( or expression of a dominant - negative Rab35 mutant ) did not affect the ability of LPA to recruit CLIC4 to the plasma membrane , whereas CLIC4 depletion did not detectably alter the subcellular localization of Rab35 ( data not shown ) . Next , we measured the levels of active Rab35 - GTP in shControl and CLIC4 - depleted HeLa cells before and after LPA stimulation ( 1 m M ; 2 min ) by using Rab35 - GTP pulldown assays ( Fukuda et al . , 2011 ) . Interestingly , we observed a twofold increase in Rab35 - GTP in CLIC4 - depleted cells compared to control cells , both in the absence and presence of LPA ( Fig . 8C , D ) . It thus appears that CLIC4 suppresses Rab35 activity , in a manner independent of LPA signaling . Opposing effects of CLIC4 and Rab35 on b 1 integrin trafficking We next examined how the observed interplay between CLIC4 and Rab35 affected b 1 integrin trafficking using the biotin - labeling and ELISA protocol and flow cytometry in Rab35 - depleted versus control cells . Unlike CLIC4 , Rab35 was not required for the serum - or LPA - induced recycling of integrin a 5 b 1 ( Fig . 8E ; data not shown ) . Furthermore , Rab35 depletion did not affect b 1 integrin degradation ( data not shown ) . In marked contrast , the internalization of integrin a 5 b 1 was increased by , 50 % upon Rab35 knockdown ( Fig . 8F ) , strongly suggesting that Rab35 is a suppressor of a 5 b 1 internalization . In conclusion , our results indicate that CLIC4 , but not Rab35 , regulates serum - and LPA - stimulated integrin recycling , whereas CLIC4 and Rab35 have opposing effects on integrin internalization . DISCUSSION The present study uncovers a new role for CLIC4 in the serum - and LPA - stimulated recycling of b 1 integrin , and underscores the importance of CLIC4 in epithelial cell – matrix adhesion and motility . Building on our previous finding that CLIC4 is rapidly recruited to the plasma membrane in response to LPA ( Ponsioen et al . , 2009 ) , we now show that LPA stimulation promotes the colocalization of CLIC4 with b 1 integrin at the plasma membrane and in Rab35 - positive endosomes . CLIC4 appears to be required for both the constitutive internalization of integrin a 5 b 1 as well as its serum - or LPA - dependent recycling . These findings might explain the observed differences in cell – matrix adhesion , focal adhesion assembly , and cell motility upon CLIC4 depletion . Although we find that CLIC4 opposes Rab35 activation and thereby promotes integrin endocytosis ( discussed below ) , it remains to be examined whether CLIC4 - regulated cell adhesion and motility requires Rab35 . Our results are in line with previous studies , showing that CLIC4 depletion leads to reduced cell adhesion and increased motility in retinal pigment epithelial cells ( Chuang et al . , 2010 ) , and to reduced cell adhesion in skin keratinocytes ( Padmakumar et al . , 2012 ) . In the latter study , CLIC4 - deficient keratinocytes were found to adhere less efficiently to a matrix secreted by wild - type keratinocytes , and this adhesion defect most likely underlies the impaired wound healing observed in Clic4 2 / 2 mice ( Padmakumar et al . , 2012 ) . Integrin trafficking through the endosomal system has emerged as a pivotal mechanism to regulate integrin function , and requires the concerted action of diverse protein families including kinases , sorting nexins and small GTPases of the Arf and Rab families ( Caswell et al . , 2009 ; Margadant et al . , 2011 ; Pellinen and Ivaska , 2006 ; Rainero and Norman , 2013 ) . Our data now identify CLIC4 as a new player in integrin trafficking , which intriguingly impacts on both internalization and stimulated recycling of b 1 integrin . It seems that CLIC4 predominantly colocalizes with internalized integrins in their active conformation , in agreement with the notion that internal integrins consist mainly in their active conformation ( Arjonen et al . , 2012 ; Dozynkiewicz et al . , 2012 ; Lobert et al . , 2010 ; Margadant et al . , 2012 ) . Given that integrins can co - traffic with growth factor receptors , most notably EGFR , we also tested whether CLIC4 affects EGFR trafficking . Importantly , EGFR endocytosis , recycling and degradation were not affected by CLIC4 depletion , suggesting that CLIC4 acts on specific cargo rather than on vesicular trafficking in general . Another member of the CLIC family , CLIC3 , has been reported to colocalize with integrin a 5 b 1 in late endosomes and lysosomes , and to protect integrin a 5 b 1 from degradation by promoting its recycling to the plasma membrane ( Dozynkiewicz et al . , 2012 ) . Unlike CLIC3 , however , CLIC4 is not detected in late endosomal or lysosomal compartments , and CLIC4 depletion does not affect integrin degradation . This strongly suggests that CLIC4 is not required for the sorting of internalized integrins between recycling and degradation pathways , and also explains the observation that steady - state integrin levels are not reduced in the absence of CLIC4 . Thus , CLIC4 and CLIC3 act in distinct subcellular compartments and differentially regulate the fate of internalized b 1 integrin . CLIC4 depletion did not affect the levels of other CLIC proteins ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the other family members do not exert compensatory effects . Consistent with CLIC4 regulating integrin internalization , CLIC4 colocalized with b 1 integrin in EEA - 1 - positive early endosomes . However , CLIC4 did not colocalize with Rab4 , a mediator of fast short - loop integrin recycling , or with Rab11 , which stimulates long - loop integrin recycling through the perinuclear recycling compartment ( Roberts et al . , 2001 ) . Instead , CLIC4 colocalized with b 1 integrin in a subset of Rab35 - positive endosomes . The observation that CLIC4 localizes with b 1 integrin in just a subset of all EEA1 - or Rab35 - positive endosomes suggests that the CLIC4 – integrin - b 1 interaction is likely to be a short - lived phenomenon , occurring at distinct steps along the integrin trafficking pathway . Rab35 regulates endocytic trafficking of diverse proteins , and depending on the cargo and cell system , its effects can be either stimulatory or inhibitory ( Allaire et al . , 2010 ; Allaire et al . , 2013 ; Chesneau et al . , 2012 ; Kouranti et al . , 2006 ) . We find that Rab35 does not affect integrin recycling triggered by LPA or serum , consistent with the observation that Rab35 activity is not detectably altered upon LPA stimulation . Instead , Rab35 suppresses integrin internalization , and CLIC4 and Rab35 thus exert opposing effects on b 1 endocytosis . The unexpected finding that Rab35 activity is higher in CLIC4 - depleted cells suggests that CLIC4 can stimulate integrin endocytosis through inhibition of Rab35 . Possibly , the recruitment of CLIC4 to Rab35 - positive compartments is a regulatory mechanism to fine - tune integrin endocytosis . In agreement with our results , a previous study also found no effect of Rab35 on b 1 integrin recycling ( Allaire et al . , 2010 ) . In a subsequent study , however , the authors reported that Rab35 knockdown increased b 1 integrin recycling ( Allaire et al . , 2013 ) . Importantly , in the latter study , cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 ˚ C with anti - integrin antibodies , after which surface - bound antibodies were stripped and the appearance on the cell surface of previously internalized integrin – antibody complexes was measured . As such , this set - up does not exclude the RESEARCH ARTICLE Journal of Cell Science ( 2014 ) 127 , 5189 – 5203 doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 150623 5199 J o u r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e possibility that the enhanced ‘re - surfacing’ in the absence of Rab35 is actually the result of increased internalization , consistent with what we find here . Future studies should address the mechanistic basis of the apparently opposing effects of CLIC4 and Rab35 on b 1 integrin endocytosis and how CLIC4 suppresses Rab35 activity . Furthermore , a possible role of Rab35 in CLIC4 - mediated cell adhesion remains to be established . One difficulty with such studies is that ( 1 ) the precise function of CLIC4 remains elusive , and ( 2 ) Rab35 acts on at least six distinct effectors , consistent with Rab35 mediating numerous processes , and that its activity is regulated by multiple guanine - nucleotide - exchange factors and GTPase - activating proteins ( Chaineau et al . , 2013 ; Chua et al . , 2010 ) . Elucidating the mode of action of CLIC4 and its family members remains a major challenge . Identification of specific binding partners should help to clarify how CLIC4 acts in integrin trafficking and receptor signaling . In a proteomic screen , we found b 1 integrin in GFP – CLIC4 immunoprecipitates , but we were unable to detect a direct interaction ( data not shown ) . Candidate binding partners for CLIC4 include cytoskeletal components ( Berryman and Goldenring , 2003 ; Suginta et al . , 2001 ) , but there is as yet no compelling evidence for a strong direct binding between CLIC4 and other proteins . Therefore , CLIC4 interactions are likely to be weak and / or highly dynamic . Such weak and / or transient interactions might allow CLIC4 to briefly interact with distinct partners along a given pathway , thus facilitating signal integration ( Jiang et al . , 2014 ) , Of interest , emerging evidence suggests a role for CLIC proteins in intravesicular pH regulation . In endothelial cells , CLIC4 supports intravesicular acidification and vacuolar fusion through an unknown mechanism ( Ulmasov et al . , 2009 ) . Similarly , CLIC1 contributes to phagosome acidification in macrophages but , again , the underlying mechanism is unknown ( Jiang et al . , 2012 ) . Vesicular acidification normally is regulated by the V - ATPase - driven proton pump in conjunction with Cl 2 channels and Cl 2 / H + exchangers of the ClC family ( unrelated to the CLICs ) ( Stauber and Jentsch , 2013 ) . Given that Cl 2 - dependent intravesicular acidification is key to endocytic – exocytic trafficking events , it will be interesting to explore whether CLIC4 ( and other CLICs ) might modulate , either directly or indirectly , V - ATPase activity or ClC channel function in distinct endocytic compartments .

To measure random cell motility , cells were seeded on collagen - coated six - well plates , serum starved overnight and either stimulated with 1 m M LPA or left untreated . Phase - contrast images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope equipped with a heated ( 37 ˚ C ) chamber and CO 2 ( 5 % ) controller . Images were taken every 2 min during 8 h and the distance covered by the cells and cell directionality were analyzed using ImageJ software .

Imaging of the samples was carried out on a Leica SR - GSD microscope equipped with a 100 6 oil immersion objective ( NA 1 . 47 ) , using an additional tube magnification of 1 . 6 6 . Images were acquired in total internal reflection fluorescence mode at 100 frames per second , using an EM - CCD camera . Colors were sequentially imaged in decreasing wavelength order . Laser excitation wavelengths were 532 nm and 632 nm , using a QUAD filter cube . Electron microscopy For electron micrscopy studies , cells were fixed in 2 % PFA plus 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M PHEM buffer ( 60 mM PIPES , 25 mM HEPES pH 6 . 9 , 2 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM EGTA , ) and then processed for ultrathin cryo - sectioning as described previously ( Calafat et al . , 1997 ) . Briefly , 50 - nm cryosections were cut at 2 120 ˚ C using diamond knives in a cryo - ultramicrotome ( Leica Aktiengesellschaft , Vienna , Austria ) and transferred with a mixture of sucrose and methylcellulose onto formvar - coated copper grids . The grids were placed on 35 - mm dishes containing 2 % gelatin . Ultrathin frozen sections were incubated at room temperature with mouse monoclonal anti - b 1 integrin antibody ( TS2 / 16 ) followed by a rabbit anti - mouse bridging antibody and then incubated with 5 - nm protein - A - conjugated colloidal gold ( EM Lab , Utrecht University , The Netherlands ) as a first marker . To block protein - A - binding sites , the sections were fixed for 10 min with 1 % glutaraldehyde . Sections were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti - CLIC4 antibody , which was marked by 15 - nm protein - A - conjugated colloidal gold . Immuno - labeled sections were embedded in a mixture of methylcellulose and uranyl acetate and examined with a Philips CM10 electron microscope ( FEI Company , Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) .

Integrin internalization was allowed by incubation in serum - free DMEM for 2 h at 37 ˚ C . Recycling was induced by adding 10 % FBS for 5 and 15 min . Cells were then fixed and processed for confocal analysis as described above . Biochemical assays Biochemical assays of integrin internalization and recycling were performed essentially as described earlier ( Roberts et al . , 2001 ) . Briefly , cells were serum starved for 1 h and then washed twice with ice - cold PBS . Cell surface proteins were labelled using NHS - SS - Biotin ( 0 . 13 mg / ml ) in PBS for 30 min at 4 ˚ C , and washed twice . For integrin internalization , cells were exposed to serum - free medium at 37 ˚ C for the indicated time periods ( 0 – 15 min ) . Cells were transferred to ice and washed with cold PBS . Remaining biotin at the plasma membrane was reduced with sodium 2 - mercaptoethane sulfonate ( MesNa ) , and the reaction was quenched with iodoacetamide ( IAA ) before cell lysis . For integrin recycling assays , cells were labeled with biotin as above , and incubated in serum - free medium at 37 ˚ C for 30 min to allow internalization of cell surface integrins . Cells were returned to ice and washed twice with ice - cold PBS , and biotin was reduced using MesNa . Recycling of the internal pool was induced by adding 10 % FBS at 37 ˚ C for the indicated time periods ( 0 – 30 min ) . Cells were then returned to ice , washed twice with cold PBS and biotin at the cell surface was reduced by MesNa . MesNa was quenched by IAA and the cells were lysed . Biotin - labeled a 5 b 1 integrin was detected by capture ELISA , using MaxiSorp 96 - well plates ( Nunc Thermo Scientific ) coated with 5 m g / ml of anti - a 5 integrin antibody . To determine integrin degradation , cells were labeled with biotin and incubated in medium with 10 % FBS for up to 6 h , whereafter the cells were lysed and biotin - labelled integrin a 5 b 1 was detected by ELISA as described above . FACS - based assays The b 1 integrin recycling assay was performed as described previously ( Allaire et al . , 2013 ) . Briefly , cells were serum staved in recycling buffer ( DMEM supplemented with 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 and 0 . 1 % BSA ) for 1 h and incubated with anti - b 1 - integrin antibody TS2 / 16 ( 1 m g per 10 6 cells ) , at 4 ˚ C for 1 h . Cells were washed twice with ice - cold recycling buffer and shifted to 37 ˚ C for 30 min ( pulse ) . Cells were cooled on ice and anti - b 1 - integrin antibody at the plasma membrane was stripped with two acid and salt washes ( 50 mM glycine , 150 mM NaCl , pH 2 . 5 ) . Cells were then incubated in recycling buffer supplemented with 10 % FBS and FITC - conjugated anti - mouse - IgG antibody ( 1 : 500 ) at 37 ˚ C for the indicated recycling time , washed twice with cold recycling buffer , scraped off the plates and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above . EGFR recycling , internalization and degradation assays EGFR recycling assays were performed as described previously ( Sigismund et al . , 2008 ) . Cells were serum starved in recycling buffer ( DMEM plus 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 and 0 . 1 % BSA ) for 4 h and incubated with 20 ng / ml EGF at 4 ˚ C for 1 h . Cells were washed twice with ice - cold recycling buffer and shifted to 37 ˚ C for 15 min ( pulse ) . Cells were cooled on ice and residual EGF at the plasma membrane was stripped off with a mild acid and salt wash ( 0 . 2 M acetic acid and 0 . 5 M NaCl , pH 4 . 5 ) . Cells were returned to 37 ˚ C for the indicated recycling time ( 0 – 20 min ) , washed twice with cold recycling buffer , trypsinized and fixed with 4 % PFA on ice . EGFR at the plasma membrane was stained with anti - EGFR antibody ( clone Ab - 1 ) , and processed for flow cytometry as described above . For EGFR internalization , cells were serum starved overnight in serum starvation medium and incubated with 100 ng / ml EGF at 4 ˚ C for 1 h . Excess of EGF was washed out by two washes with cold starvation medium and cells shifted to 37 ˚ C for the indicated time points ( 0 – 15 min ) . Cells were trypsinized and fixed with 4 % PFA on ice and treated as above for flow cytometry analysis . For EGFR degradation , cells were serum starved overnight and either left untreated or stimulated with 100 ng / ml EGF for the indicated time periods ( 0 – 180 min ) . Total cell lysates were loaded on SDS - PAGE and EGFR levels determined by anti - EGFR ( clone 1005 ) immunoblot analysis . Rab35 - GTP pulldown assays To measure the cellular levels of Rab35 - GTP , the selective trap GST – RBD35 ( the RUN domain of mRUSC2 fused to GST ) was used as described previously ( Fukuda et al . , 2011 ) . Briefly , shControl and shCLIC4 HeLa cells were transfected with 2 6 Myc – Rab35 and serum starved overnight . At 24 h after transfection , cells were stimulated with 1 m M LPA for 2 min or left untreated . Glutathione – Sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare ) coupled to 30 m g purified GST – RBD35 were incubated with 500 m g total cell lysate for 30 min at 4 ˚ C . Beads were washed three times and GTP - Rab35 bound to the beads was analyzed by immunoblotting using anti - Rab35 antibody . Total cell lysates were loaded on SDS - PAGE and GTP - Rab35 levels detected by anti - Myc immunoblot analysis .
