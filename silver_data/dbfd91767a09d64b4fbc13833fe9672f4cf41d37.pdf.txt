A complexin fusion clamp regulates spontaneous neurotransmitter release and synaptic growth Sarah Huntwork & J Troy Littleton Neuronal signaling occurs through both action potential – triggered synaptic vesicle fusion and spontaneous release , although the fusion clamp machinery that prevents premature exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in the absence of calcium is unknown . Here we demonstrate that spontaneous release at synapses is regulated by complexin , a SNARE complex – binding protein . Analysis of Drosophila melanogaster complexin null mutants showed a marked increase in spontaneous fusion and a profound overgrowth of synapses , suggesting that complexin functions as the fusion clamp in vivo and may modulate structural remodeling of neuronal connections by controlling the rate of spontaneous release . Intracellular vesicular trafﬁcking is ubiquitous among eukaryotes , with vesicle fusion driven by assembly of the SNARE ( soluble N - ethyl - maleimide – sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ) complex 1 . Unlike most membrane trafﬁcking events , synaptic vesicles must wait in a fusion - competent state for an action potential to trigger calcium inﬂux . To modify the properties of the constitutive SNARE machinery for synaptic transmission , synapse - speciﬁc regulatory proteins have evolved to facilitate rapid calcium - dependent synaptic vesicle fusion 2 . Complexins are small neuron - speciﬁc cytosolic proteins that interact with assembled SNARE complexes with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry 3 , 4 . When two of the four mouse complexin genes are removed , evoked neuro - transmitter release is decreased in hippocampal autaptic cultures 5 , suggesting a positive role in synaptic vesicle fusion . However , recent biochemical evidence demonstrates that complexin can reduce SNARE - mediated fusion in vitro in cell - cell 6 or liposome 7 fusion assays largely because of a block in inner - leaﬂet mixing 7 , suggesting that complexin may function as a clamp to stabilize a hemifusion inter - mediate formed by the SNARE complex . To determine the function of complexin in vivo , we generated the ﬁrst , to our knowledge , complete knockout of complexin in any organism . Drosophila has a single gene ( Supplementary Fig . 1 online ) encoding the complexin protein 8 . We generated antisera to recombi - nant Drosophila complexin protein that recognized a 16 - kDa protein in brain extracts that is enriched in both CNS and peripheral synapses ( Fig . 1a ) . Costaining for complexin and Discs large ( Dlg ) or the active - zone protein bruchpilot demonstrated that complexin is expressed diffusely in presynaptic terminals ( Fig . 1b – d ) . A 17 - kb intragenic deletion within complexin ( cpx SH1 ) that removed most of the coding region was generated by imprecise excision of a P element ( Fig . 1e and Supplementary Fig . 2 online ) . A precise excision lacking any deletion was also generated , and served as a control for genetic background in all experiments . Western analysis ( Fig . 1f ) and immunocytochemistry conﬁrmed the loss of expression of complexin in cpx SH1 . Null mutants lacking complexin are semilethal , with most animals dying before adult eclosion . Escaper adults are infertile , show severe motor defects and lack the on - and off - transients that represent normal synaptic trans - mission in the visual system ( Fig . 1g ) . Pan - neuronal expression of a UAS - complexin transgene with the elav - GAL4 neuronal driver rescues the reduced viability and abnormal synaptic transmission of cpx SH1 mutants ( Fig . 1g ) . To analyze the role of complexin in neurotransmitter release , we performed electrophysiological recordings at Drosophila third - instar larval abdominal muscle 6 synapses . cpx SH1 mutants had profound defects in spontaneous vesicle fusion . The frequency of miniature excitatory junctional potentials ( minis ) was greatly enhanced at cpx SH1 mutant synapses ( 67 ± 4 . 8 Hz compared to 3 . 1 ± 0 . 3 Hz at control synapses ) , demonstrating continuous exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in the absence of any stimulation ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Neuronal expression of a UAS - complexin transgene rescued the enhanced fre - quency of spontaneous release ( Fig . 2a , b ) . In high extracellular [ Ca 2 + ] , evoked responses in cpx SH1 mutants after nerve stimulation were signiﬁcantly reduced compared with controls , whereas in low extra - cellular [ Ca 2 + ] we observed no difference ( Fig . 2c , d ) . As described below , complexin mutant synapses showed a 64 % increase in active zone number , indicating that neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) synapses lacking complexin had a reduction in evoked fusion events per active zone that was exacerbated at high calcium levels , where large numbers of synchronous synaptic vesicle fusion events are required . To conﬁrm that the increase in miniature postsynaptic potentials resulted from increased spontaneous vesicle fusion , as opposed to nonvesicular dumping of glutamate at the synapse , we used a tem - perature - sensitive allele of dynamin ( shibire TS1 ) that blocks endo - cytosis at 32 1 C . High - frequency stimulation at 32 1 C depletes the synaptic vesicle pool in shibire mutants and would be predicted to eliminate the enhanced spontaneous vesicle fusion in double mutants . After a 5 - min 10 - Hz stimulation train at 32 1 C in shibire TS1 ; cpx SH1 double mutants , which abolished evoked release , the elevated mini frequency observed at permissive temperatures was eliminated ( Fig . 2e ) . The frequency of spontaneous release in cpx SH1 mutants remained strongly elevated in 0 mM extracellular calcium ( Fig . 2f ) , ruling out an aberrant inﬂux of calcium into the presynaptic nerve terminal as the cause for the enhanced spontaneous release . These observations suggest that complexin functions as the synaptic vesicle fusion clamp in vivo , and with its loss , synaptic vesicles continuously fuse in the absence of stimulation .

To analyze synaptic structure , we counted synaptic varicosities in age - matched control and cpx SH1 third - instar NMJs . cpx SH1 mutants showed a two - fold overproliferation of boutons at each muscle examined , as well as 64 % more active zones ( Fig . 3 , Supplementary Fig . 3 online ) . Neuronal expression of a complexin transgene reverted the synaptic overgrowth phenotype ( Fig . 3b ) . These data eliminate any structural considerations that could account for the enhanced minis , as the 64 % increase in the number of active zones is insufﬁcient by far to explain the 4 20 - fold increase in spontaneous release . Our analysis demonstrates that the inter - actions of complexin with SNAREs provide a molecular fusion clamp to prevent sponta - neous release at synapses in the absence of stimulation . These in vivo observations match well with the predicted fusion clamp model based on the in vitro reduction of SNARE - mediated fusion by complexin 6 , 7 . Although analysis of cultured hippocampal autaptic neurons lacking two of the four mouse complexin genes 9 showed reduced neurotransmitter release 5 , which matches the observations in Drosophila , mini frequency in the mouse system was reported to be unchanged . Although it is unclear what underlies the discrepancy in mini frequency between models , one potential explanation is that in mouse either complexin 3 or 4 or other unknown components of the fusion clamp machinery compensate for the loss of complexin . 1s 1b Axon Bouton 1 µ M HRP Cpx Merge 2 µ M nc82nc82CpxCpx DlgDlgCpxCpx DlgDlgCpxCpx 5 µ M 20 µ M 0 Kb 10 Kb 20 Kb 30 Kb ATG cpx CG1102 Syt 1 Cpx cpx Control cpx + f g e 500 ms 5 mV cpx Control Rescue b c d a Figure 1 Generation of complexin mutants in Drosophila .

Our results unexpectedly uncovered a marked effect on synaptic growth at the Drosophila NMJ in complexin mutants . Although pre - vious studies in hyperexcitable Drosophila mutants have demonstrated that increased neuronal activity promotes synaptic growth 10 , the contributions of spontaneous versus evoked signaling are unknown . Activity - dependent retrograde signaling by the post - synaptic calcium sensor Synaptotagmin 4 has also been shown to transiently increase mini frequency 100 - fold and trigger enhanced synaptic growth at Drosophila embryonic NMJs 11 . It is tempting to speculate that reg - ulation of complexin during retrograde signaling underlies activity - dependent enhancement of spontaneous fusion and synaptic growth . There is at present no evidence that the increased minis cause the morphological overgrowth , and further studies will be required to dissect the mechanism by which complexin mutants enhance synaptic growth . Recent work in mammals suggests that spontaneous release can regulate dendritic spine morphogenesis 12 and dendritic protein synthesis 13 . Complexin dysfunction has also been implicated in human diseases , including schizophrenia 14 , indicating that abnormal sponta - neous fusion may contribute to certain neurological diseases . Given that complexin and the synaptic vesicle calcium sensor Synaptotagmin 1 may compete for binding to SNARE complexes 15 , an attractive model for synaptic vesicle exocytosis is that complexin stabilizes a hemifused intermediate that can complete full fusion upon calcium activation of Synaptotagmin 1 . Together with Synaptotagmin 1 , complexin provides a key neuronal modulator of SNARE function that adapts the ubiqui - tous membrane trafﬁcking machinery for synaptic vesicle fusion .
