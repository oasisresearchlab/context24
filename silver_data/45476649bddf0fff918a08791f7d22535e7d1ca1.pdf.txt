GENETIC AND ULTRASTRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF CAFETERIA ROENBERGENSIS VIRUS AND ITS VIROPHAGE MAVIRUS by MATTHIAS GUNTHER FISCHER Dipl . Biochem . , University of Bayreuth , Germany , 2003 A THESIS SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY in THE FACULTY OF GRADUATE STUDIES ( Microbiology and Immunology ) THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA ( Vancouver ) March 2011 © Matthias Gunther Fischer , 2011 ii Abstract Giant viruses infecting unicellular eukaryotes have genomes that overlap in size and coding content with the smallest cellular life forms , thereby blurring the boundary between what is considered living and non - living . Due to their recent discovery , little is known about the biology and host range of giant viruses . In this dissertation , I characterize Cafeteria roenbergensis virus ( CroV ) , the largest marine virus known to date . CroV infects the phagotrophic nanoflagellate C . roenbergensis , a widespread and ecologically important marine zooplankton species . CroV has a 730 kilobase pair DNA genome which is predicted to encode 544 proteins and 22 transfer RNAs . Four genes contained an intein insertion and several genes have not been found before in viruses , including an isoleucyl - tRNA synthetase and a histone acetyltransferase . A 38 kilobase pair region of putative bacterial origin encoded predicted enzymes for the biosynthesis of 3 - deoxy - D - manno - octulosonate , a key component of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide layer . Microarray analysis revealed that at least 274 CroV genes were transcribed during infection and that different genes were expressed at early and late stages of viral replication . Promoter sequences specific for each stage were identified . Proteomic analyses showed that the virion is composed of at least 129 CroV - encoded proteins , including a large set of transcription enzymes and several DNA repair proteins . Phylogenetically , CroV was found to belong to the group of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses and was most closely related to Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus , although only a third of the CroV genes had homologues in Mimivirus . I also discovered a smaller virus , the Mavirus virophage , whose replication was dependent on co - infection by CroV and led to decreased CroV production and increased host - cell survival . Mavirus particles co - localized within the CroV virion factory , as shown by transmission electron microscopy of infected cells . Remarkably , the 19 kilobase pair DNA genome of Mavirus was most similar to the Maverick / Polinton eukaryotic DNA transposons , which led to the hypothesis that these transposons have originated from the endogenization of ancient virophages into eukaryotic genomes . This work describes the first giant virus infecting a zooplankton species and demonstrates a clear link between Mavirus and Maverick transposons . iii Preface The work presented in this dissertation would not have been possible without contributions made by collaborators , contractors , and undergraduate students , as described in the following paragraphs . In chapters 2 and 4 , 454 pyrosequencing and automated contig assembly was contracted at 454 Life Sciences , Branford , CT , USA , and at the McGill University and Génome Québec Innovation Centre , Montréal , QC , Canada . The amino acid alignment of isoleucyl - tRNA synthetases , on which the phylogenetic tree in Fig . 2 . 9 is based , was constructed by Shi ' Small ' Mang as part of an undergraduate research project . In chapter 2 , the microarray study was conceived by Drs . Michael Allen and William Wilson at the Plymouth Marine Laboratories , Plymouth , UK , and was carried out in the laboratory of Dr . Wilson under the supervision of Dr . Allen . Dr . Allen designed the oligonucleotides and ordered the microarray slides , which were manufactured at the Liverpool Microarray Facility , UK . He also made significant contributions to experimentation and data analysis and was responsible for deposition of the microarray data in the GEO database . For microarray analysis , I planned and conducted the infection experiments in Cafeteria roenbergensis , extracted mRNA from infected cells , performed the microarray experiments ( cDNA synthesis and labelling , hybridization , image analysis ) under the guidance of Dr . Allen , and analyzed the microarray data . In chapter 3 , the proteome study was conceived by Drs . Leonard Foster and Curtis Suttle of the University of British Columbia . SDS - PAGE , enzymatic treatments , LC - MS / MS analysis , and mass spec data analysis were conducted by Dr . Isabelle Kelly in the laboratory of Dr . Foster , who contributed to data analysis and manuscript revision . I provided pure virions for mass spectrometry , analyzed the data , and wrote the manuscript , for which Dr . Kelly contributed part of the materials and methods section . In chapter 5 , Dr . Garnet Martens and Bradford Ross from the UBC Bioimaging Facility were contracted to perform cryo - fixation , freeze - substitution , osmication , block preparation , ultra - thin sectioning , and staining of TEM samples . Amy Chan assisted during preparation of infected cells for cryo - fixation . I conceived and performed the infection experiments , collected and analyzed the TEM data , and wrote the manuscript . In chapters 1 - 6 , I performed all other experimental work , data analysis , and manuscript writing . My contributions included maintenance of C . roenbergensis cultures , performance of infection studies , virus purification and quantification , and gap - closing of the CroV genome , which iv involved the construction of genomic shotgun libraries as well as PCR experiments and bioinformatic methods . Furthermore , I was responsible for annotation of the genomes of CroV , Mavirus , and phage307 . I discovered the Mavirus virophage and developed the hypothesis of viral transposogenesis for Maverick / Polinton DNA transposons . As research advisor , Dr . Curtis Suttle was involved in all aspects of this work , including conceptualization of the experiments and manuscript writing . A version of chapter 2 has been published : Fischer M .

As early as 1971 , Lee reported a viral infection in the freshwater red alga Sirodotia tenuissima [ 1 ] . In the late 1980s and early 1990s , the first reliable numbers about the abundance of aquatic viruses emerged [ 2 - 4 ] , showing that there are typically ~ 1x10 7 viruses per ml of seawater ( reviewed in [ 5 , 6 ] ) . This makes viruses the most abundant biological entities in the ocean , outnumbering their hosts usually by an order of magnitude [ 7 ] . Viral abundance is correlated with primary productivity and usually decreases with distance from shore and increasing depth [ 7 ] . Viruses are major agents of mortality [ 8 ] and can terminate algal blooms , e . g . of the dimethyl sulphide producer Emiliania huxleyi [ 9 , 10 ] or harmful algal bloom formers such as Heterosigma akashiwo [ 11 , 12 ] and Heterocapsa circularisquama [ 13 , 14 ] . Viruses play important roles in marine ecosystems by influencing the biodiversity of their hosts and driving global biogeochemical processes [ 15 ] . Moreover , the marine virosphere harbours an enormous genetic diversity and genes are frequently exchanged between different viruses as well as between viruses and their hosts [ 16 - 19 ] . Since bacteria constitute the numerically dominant group of cellular plankton , bacteriophages have been studied in great detail ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . In contrast , protist - infecting viruses have only recently attracted wider attention , due to the fact that several of them contain very large double - stranded ( ds ) DNA genomes with hundreds of genes . Since many of these genes have homologues in cellular organisms , protistal viruses are prime candidates to study horizontal gene transfer , virus - host co - evolution , and the evolution of large DNA virus genomes . 1 . 2 Giant DNA viruses Viruses are extremely diverse in terms of capsid size , capsid shape , type of nucleic acid and genome size [ 21 ] . The smallest virus genomes ( Circoviridae with 1 . 8 kilobases [ kb ] single - stranded DNA ) and the largest virus genomes ( Mimiviridae with 1 . 2 megabase pair [ Mbp ] dsDNA ) are separated by three orders of magnitude . For several decades , herpesviruses and poxviruses were the largest known viruses , until a family of double - stranded ( ds ) DNA viruses called the Phycodnaviridae was discovered in the 1980s [ 22 ] . These algal viruses have genome sizes of 155 kbp to 560 kbp and encode between 150 and 472 proteins [ 23 ] . Another relatively unknown family of large dsDNA viruses are the Polydnaviridae , which exist in a symbiotic relationship with parasitic wasps . They are normally excluded from comparative analysis with 2 other large dsDNA viruses owing to the proviral and multipartite state of their genomes , their extremely low gene densities , and their unique gene contents [ 24 , 25 ] . The largest fully sequenced virus genome currently known is that of Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus [ 26 ] . The term " giant virus " ( also called girus [ 27 ] ) generally refers to viruses with large dsDNA genomes , but is loosely defined with regard to the included genome range . Whereas some people set the lower threshold to ~ 150 kbp [ 28 ] , others draw the line at 280 - 300 kbp [ 27 , 29 ] . Alternatively , one could only consider viruses with genomes larger than the smallest cellular genomes , which would set the threshold to 500 - 600 kbp ( Nanoarchaeum equitans : 491 kbp ; Mycoplasma genitalium : 580 kbp ) . I will here use the term giant virus to refer to dsDNA viruses with a genome size larger than 300 kbp . According to this definition , there are currently ~ 24 giant viruses known ( Table 1 . 1 ) . This number may soon be doubled , as 19 new giant viruses have recently been isolated on A . polyphaga [ 30 ] . Table 1 . 1 Giant viruses .

Examples of monophyletic groups are the positive - strand RNA viruses , the retroviruses and retroelements , the rolling - circle replicating viruses and mobile elements , and the tailed bacteriophages [ 48 ] . One of the most diverse groups of apparent monophyletic origin is the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus ( NCDLV ) clade . This clade consists of eukaryotic viruses with mostly icosahedral , but also bacilliform or pleomorphic capsids and dsDNA genomes larger than 100 kbp . The NCLDVs replicate partially or entirely in the host cytoplasm and comprise the families Ascoviridae , Asfarviridae , Iridoviridae , Mimiviridae , Phycodnaviridae , Poxviridae , and the Marseillevirus [ 39 , 49 , 50 ] . NCLDVs infect a wide range of host species , from amoebae and algae to insects and mammals . Table 1 . 2 lists selected characteristics of the individual NCLDV families . Because NCLDVs comprise the largest known viruses and the number of fully sequenced NCLDV genomes is growing continually , this group of viruses provides a large dataset to study the evolution of large DNA viruses and the impact of viruses on the evolution of their hosts via horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) . Their classification into a presumably monophyletic group is based on a common set of genes that are present in most members and are referred to as NCLDV core genes . Since the first analysis by Iyer , Aravind , and Koonin [ 49 ] , the presumed core gene set of the ancestral NCLDV has expanded from 31 to about 50 genes [ 51 , 52 ] . The NCLDV ancestor must thus have been a virus of considerable size and complexity , encoding enzymes for genome replication , transcription , nucleotide metabolism , genome packaging , redox catalysis , and virion structure [ 49 , 50 , 52 ] . Some lineages have lost several of these ancestral genes , e . g . the phycodnavirus Feldmannia sp . virus 158 , which carries a significantly reduced set of NCLDV core genes [ 28 ] , and all phycodnaviruses , except for the 4 coccolithoviruses , which lack transcription genes [ 53 ] . Nevertheless , all NCLDVs have experienced a net genome growth over time and they comprise the most complex viruses known . Mimivirus and the poxviruses replicate exclusively in the host cytoplasm and encode all genes necessary for DNA replication and transcription , as well as many additional enzymatic functions [ 54 , 55 ] . Many NCLDVs possess genes that are usually absent in viruses , including enzymes involved in protein biosynthesis , DNA repair , and diverse metabolic pathways [ 50 ] . A detailed discussion of the extensive coding potential found in NCLDVs would go beyond the scope of this introduction , but several review articles have been published on this topic [ 49 - 52 ] . In a recent effort to delineate sets of NCLDV genes that may have evolved from a common ancestor , Yutin and coworkers constructed sets of orthologous genes for 11 , 468 predicted proteins , encoded by 45 NCLDV genomes [ 51 ] . The majority of these genes were assigned to 1 , 445 NCVOGs ( Nucleocytoplasmic Virus Orthologous Genes ) that were family - specific , which implies that there is little overlap in gene content among different NCLDV families . On one hand , this finding reflects the different evolutionary histories of individual virus families , owing to varying degrees of HGT from cellular sources . On the other hand , lineage - specific gene expansion resulted in large clusters of paralogous genes , e . g . the 66 ankyrin repeat - containing proteins in Mimivirus [ 56 ] . However , 177 NCVOGs contained genes from two or more NCLDV families and they represent the key functional classes of viral replication and virion assembly [ 51 ] . The five NCVOGS that were found in all analyzed NCLDV genomes are the major capsid protein , the DNA - dependent DNA polymerase B , the FtsK - HerA - like packaging ATPase , the archaeo - eukaryotic DNA primase - helicase , and the VV A2 - like transcription factor . 5 Table 1 . 2 Family characteristics of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses . 1 . 2 . 2 Mimivirus Although the existence of giant viruses was known since the 1970s from electron microscopy of natural seawater samples [ 57 ] , and despite two decades of research on phycodnaviruses [ 58 ] , there was relatively little scientific and public interest in giant viruses . This changed radically with the discovery of Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus . Isolated in 1992 from a cooling tower in England , Mimivirus was originally mistaken for a bacterium , due to its size and propensity to stain gram - positive [ 59 ] . Several years later , electron microscopy and partial genome sequencing revealed the true identity of Mimivirus as the largest virus seen to date [ 60 ] . The 1 , 181 , 404 bp dsDNA genome sequence was published in 2004 [ 26 ] and set off an international 1 Lausannevirus was presented as a new strain of Marseillevirus at the 2010 " Viruses of Microbes " meeting at the Institut Pasteur , Paris , France .

As of October 2010 , a search for “Mimivirus” retrieved 93 publications in PubMed 2 Mimivirus has an icosahedral capsid with a diameter of 500 nm , which is covered by a 125 nm thick layer of fibres [ 61 , 62 ] . The peripheral fibres may mimic a bacterial lipopolysaccharide layer in order to trigger phagocytic uptake by the amoeba [ 63 ] . The fibre layer also effectively increases the diameter of the virion , which may be necessary for phagocytosis , as the minimum diameter of individual particles to trigger phagocytosis is 0 . 5 - 0 . 6 µm [ 64 , 65 ] . The capsid possesses a unique vertex with a starfish - like protrusion , also called the " stargate " structure [ 62 , 66 ] . The stargate acts as a portal for genome delivery , whereby five icosahedral faces open up to release the virion core . Genome packaging proceeds through a temporary opening in an icosahedral face opposite of the stargate portal [ 66 ] . The virion contains two internal membranes [ 61 ] . After phagocytosis and stargate opening , the outer membrane fuses with the phagosome , releasing the genome into the cytoplasm , still enclosed within the inner membrane [ 66 , 67 ] . Transcription of early genes then starts in this core vesicle [ 54 ] , containing at least six RNA - dependent RNA polymerase subunits and additional transcription proteins [ 68 ] . The core eventually forms the cytoplasmic virion factory ( VF ) , which produces progeny virions in an assembly line - like manner at its periphery , whereby the genome is injected into preformed capsids , followed by synthesis of the outer fibres [ 67 ] . Progeny virions are released from the cell through lysis , which usually occurs within 24 hours of infection . . The Mimivirus genome is a linear dsDNA molecule of 1 . 2 Mbp , which is predicted to adopt a Q - like secondary structure [ 59 ] . The initial genome analysis predicted 911 protein - coding sequences ( CDSs ) [ 26 ] ; a subsequent transcriptomic study using mRNA deep sequencing identified further genes and increased the number of CDSs to 981 [ 69 ] . Roughly 30 % of CDSs were assigned a putative function . An unexpected finding was the presence of a set of translation - related genes including 4 aminoacyl - tRNA synthetases , 5 translation factors , and 6 tRNA genes [ 26 ] . These genes were remarkable because viruses usually rely entirely on the host translation apparatus for protein synthesis . Several other Mimivirus CDSs had not been found in viruses before , including three DNA topoisomerases and the DNA repair enzymes formamidopyrimidine - DNA glycosylase , 6 - O - methylguanine - DNA methyltransferase , and mismatch repair protein MutS . Furthermore , Mimivirus encodes a large DNA replication and transcription machinery , a partial glutamine metabolism pathway , six glycosyltransferases , heat shock proteins HSP40 and HSP70 , and an intein element in the DNA polymerase B gene [ 26 ] . 2 http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / sites / entrez 7 Two promoter motifs were identified in the genome , one associated with early gene transcription [ 70 ] and one with late gene transcription [ 69 ] . The early gene promoter has a highly conserved consensus sequence ( AAAATTGA ) and seems to be specific for Mimivirus . Another peculiar finding about the mode of transcription in Mimivirus was that 85 % of mature viral mRNAs had a characteristic hairpin structure at their 3 ' end [ 71 ] . The underlying intergenic palindromes , which may also cause transcription termination , are unique to Mimivirus . This combined evidence strongly indicates that Mimivirus gene transcription is entirely encoded by the viral genome and occurs in the cytoplasm , independent of nuclear enzymes . Several Mimivirus gene products have been biochemically characterized , including tyrosyl and methionyl tRNA synthetases [ 72 , 73 ] , nucleoside diphosphate kinase [ 74 , 75 ] , cyclophilin [ 76 ] , mRNA capping enzyme [ 77 , 78 ] , DNA ligase [ 79 ] , DNA topoisomerase IB [ 80 ] , endonuclease VIII [ 81 ] and a mitochondrial nucleotide carrier protein [ 82 ] . All of these studies confirmed that the viral proteins were enzymatically active , showing that despite its unusual size , the Mimivirus genome encodes genes that are functional and appear to evolve under selective pressure . Analysis of the Mimivirus virion proteome showed that this giant virus packages ~ 137 virally encoded proteins , including at least 15 transcription - related and 9 redox - active proteins [ 59 , 68 ] . This makes Mimivirus a multiple record holder in the viral world , having the biggest virion , the largest viral genome , the most CDSs , and the most complex virion proteome . Mimivirus is the prototype member of the Mimiviridae family . Based on phylogenetic reconstruction of a concatenated alignment from several universally conserved proteins , Mimivirus was proposed to represent a new domain of life , having descended from an extinct cellular lineage by genome reduction [ 26 ] . However , Mimivirus shares the conserved set of NCLDV core genes and is thus related to phycodnaviruses , poxviruses , and other NCLDV families , which makes it a bona fide virus . Because its genome and particle size were larger than the smallest unicellular organisms , Mimivirus has sparked an intense debate about the origin and evolution of DNA viruses and revived the interesting , albeit rather philosophical , question whether viruses should be considered alive [ 27 , 83 - 92 ] . 1 . 2 . 3 How common are giant viruses in the environment ? The discovery of Mimivirus raised the question whether giant viruses are widespread in natural environments and might thus play an ecological role . Observations of large VLPs in natural sea water samples date back to the 1970s . In 1979 , Sicko - Goad and Walker described large VLPs in the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium uberrimum [ 57 ] . In this report , the VLPs measured 385 nm in diameter and had a pentagonal or hexagonal profile , suggesting icosahedral morphology . 8 Large VLPs ranging up to 750 nm in diameter have also been described in the vacuoles of some radiolarian groups isolated from environmental samples [ 93 ] as well as in Antarctic sea ice [ 94 ] . All of these viruses appeared to have icosahedral capsids with a diameter of 300 nm or more , containing an electron - dense core surrounded by a multilayer membrane system . Although none of the viruses have been isolated or further characterized , these reports provided a first hint at the existence of very large viruses in various marine and freshwater environments . Taking advantage of the wealth of metagenomic data collected from various marine environments by Venter et al . [ 95 , 96 ] , 15 % of Mimivirus genes were found to have their closest homologues in the Sargasso sea metagenomic dataset [ 97 ] and 25 % of Mimivirus genes were significantly similar to sequences in Sorcerer II Expedition Global Ocean Sampling ( GOS ) metagenomic data set [ 98 ] . Focussing on the Mimivirus DNA polymerase B protein , 811 homologues from putative giant viruses were found in the GOS dataset [ 99 ] . However , these metagenomic datasets contain no information about the identity of the source organism , and the question of host range for giant viruses remained unanswered . Isolation efforts concentrated on Acanthamoeba , host for the largest known virus . It did not take long until a second Mimivirus strain was isolated from a cooling tower in Paris . This strain was named Mamavirus , had a slightly larger genome than Mimivirus , and was 99 % similar in coding content to Mimivirus [ 31 ] . Another giant virus isolated on Acanthamoeba was Marseillevirus ; it has a 368 kbp genome and constitutes the first member of a new NCLDV family [ 39 ] . Subsequently , a second strain named Lausannevirus was found to be very similar to Marseillevirus [ 100 ] . Recently , a screen for Acanthamoeba - infecting giant viruses in 105 samples from such diverse environments as seawater , rivers , cooling towers , soil , and even clinical material , resulted in 19 new virus isolates with particle sizes ranging from 150 nm to 600 nm [ 30 ] . Genome analysis of these viruses is underway and will significantly expand the current giant DNA virus dataset . Acanthamoeba is unlikely to be the sole host for giant viruses , as very large DNA viruses have been reported from diverse algae [ 34 , 37 ] and heterotrophic protists [ 101 ] . It has become apparent , however , that phagotrophic protists are a suitable breeding ground for giant viruses , as they often contain eukaryotic , bacterial , and viral DNA within the same cell , which facilitates HGT [ 39 , 102 ] . Giant viruses seem to be a diverse and abundant component of the virosphere , but due to sampling protocols that tend to exclude viruses larger than 0 . 2 µm [ 103 ] , they have been overlooked until recently . 9 1 . 3 Virophages 1 . 3 . 1 The Sputnik virophage In 2008 , a new strain of Mimivirus was isolated from a cooling tower in Paris and called Acanthamoeba castellanii mamavirus [ 31 ] . Associated with Mamavirus was a novel , much smaller virus , which replicated within the Mamavirus virion factory and had a faster replication cycle than Mamavirus ( particles appeared at 6 h and 8 h post infection , respectively ) . Co - infection of amoebae with Mamavirus and the smaller virus increased the survival rate of the host cells while causing defective Mamavirus capsid structures and a 70 % decrease in infective Mamavirus particles [ 31 ] . Because the smaller virus did not replicate in the absence of Mamavirus , it qualified as a satellite virus and was named Sputnik ( Russian for " satellite " ) . However , Sputnik was remarkably different from known satellite agents and La Scola et al . argued that , because of its unusual lifestyle as a true parasite of another virus , Sputnik represented a new class of satellite viruses . They therefore coined the term " virophage " for any virus “using the viral factory of another virus to propagate at the expense of its viral host” [ 31 ] . Analysis of the 18 kbp circular dsDNA genome of Sputnik revealed that some of its 21 protein - coding genes had homologues in archaea , bacteria , and eukaryotes . Most interestingly , three genes were apparently derived from its host virus as they had close relatives in Mimi - and Mamavirus . This suggested that virophages could be hitherto unrecognized vehicles of HGT between giant viruses and cellular organisms . The coding content of Sputnik included genes typically found in NCLDVs and bacteriophages such as a superfamily 3 helicase and an FtsK - HerA family DNA packaging ATPase . An integrase of the tyrosine recombinase family led La Scola et al . to propose the existence of integrated forms of virophages , so - called provirophages [ 31 ] . Although the major capsid protein ( MCP ) showed no sequence similarity to known capsid proteins , cryo - electron microscopy analysis of the Sputnik virion suggested that its MCP might adopt a double jelly - roll tertiary structure , similar to the MCPs of PBCV - 1 and other viruses of the PRD1 - adenovirus lineage [ 104 ] . The same study showed that the Sputnik particle consisted of an icosahedral capsid with a diameter of 74 nm and T = 27 symmetry . Cryo - EM also confirmed that the virion had an internal lipid membrane , as suggested by the presence of the FtsK - HerA - like packaging ATPase . The virophage concept posits that Sputnik and similar agents are parasites of their host virus rather than of the host cell . This leads to the prediction that virophages use the DNA replication and transcription enzymes encoded by their host virus and present in the virion factory [ 105 ] . Support for this hypothesis came from analysis of the Mimivirus transcriptome , which identified 10 a putative late gene promoter motif in Mimivirus that was also found upstream of 12 Sputnik genes , suggesting that Sputnik genes are transcribed concomitantly with Mimivirus late genes [ 69 ] . Furthermore , transcriptional termination in Sputnik is probably governed by the Mimivirus transcription machinery . Eighty - five percent of Mimivirus transcripts were found to end in characteristic hairpin structures that were encoded by palindromic sequences [ 71 ] . This putative transcription termination or polyadenylation signal seems to be unique to Mimivirus – with the exception of Sputnik . Within its intergenic regions , Sputnik contains the same type of palindromes [ 105 ] . The finding that Sputnik encodes Mimivirus - specific transcription signals suggested that Sputnik might indeed be dependent on Mimivirus enzymes for gene expression . 1 . 3 . 2 Virophages and other satellite viruses According to the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ) , " satellites are sub - viral agents composed of nucleic acid molecules that depend for their productive multiplication on co - infection of a host cell with a helper virus " [ 21 ] . Satellites encoding their own coat protein are called satellite viruses . The vast majority of satellite viruses occur in plants and have single - stranded RNA genomes , such as Tobacco mosaic satellite virus or chronic bee - paralysis satellite virus 3 Of several satellite bacteriophages that have been discovered [ 106 - 108 ] , the best known example is enterobacteria satellite virus P4 . Its helper phage P2 provides proteins for P4 head and tail structure , genome packaging , and host cell lysis [ 109 ] . Genome replication of P4 , on the other hand , occurs autonomously . The P4 genome is an 11 , 624 bp linear dsDNA molecule that circularizes after injection into the host cell . P4 encodes an integrase and , in the absence of a helper phage , can persist in the host as a prophage , or episomally as a high copy number plasmid [ 110 ] . In P4 - lysogenic cells , the satellite phage can sense the presence of the helper and reactivate upon P2 superinfection . Because of its episomal state , it has been proposed that P4 may have evolved from a plasmid [ 110 ] . . RNA satellite viruses are completely unrelated to the Sputnik virophage . The only satellite viruses that might be remotely comparable to the Sputnik virophage are adeno - associated viruses ( AAVs ) of the dependovirus genus ( family Parvoviridae ) . AAVs consist of a linear 4 . 7 kb ssDNA genome wrapped in a 22 nm diameter , non - enveloped icosahedral capsid . The AAV genome carries two genes ( rep and cap ) which can produce seven different proteins through the use of overlapping reading frames , alternative promoters , alternative splicing , and non - canonical start codons . The rep proteins are regulators of DNA replication and transcription , while the cap proteins constitute the capsid structure . AAVs are 3 http : / / www . ictvdb . org / Ictv / fs _ satel . htm 11 able to infect a wide range of mammalian cells and they may enter their host cells by receptor - mediated endocytosis via the formation of clathrin - coated pits . Dependoviruses have lytic or lysogenic infection cycles . Lytic infection depends on the presence of a helper virus such as adenovirus , herpes simplex virus , or cytomegalovirus ( [ 111 ] and references therein ) , whereas in the absence of a helper virus , AAV can integrate its genome into the host chromosome , where it is passed on to subsequent generations [ 112 ] . Despite having small ssDNA genomes , the AAVs share several features with virophages . First , they are replication - dependent on medium - sized to large dsDNA viruses . Second , they negatively affect replication of their helper adenovirus in co - infected cells [ 111 , 113 ] . Third , AAV can exist as a provirus , which has been proposed for virophages , but has not been demonstrated yet [ 31 ] . However , AAV genome integration is a passive process and AAVs do not encode an integrase [ 114 ] . AAVs and the Sputnik virophage have completely different genomes , and the presumably biggest difference is that AAV and its helper adenovirus replicate in the host nucleus , whereas Sputnik and Mimivirus replicate in cytoplasmic virion factories . Moreover , AAV promoters are not similar to their helper virus promoters and genes encoded by AAVs are not similar to adenoviral genes , as opposed to the observed Sputnik - Mimivirus promoter homology [ 69 ] and three Sputnik genes with close homologues in Mimivirus [ 31 ] . It can thus be concluded that Sputnik and potentially other virophages yet to be discovered are indeed very different from known satellite viruses and constitute a novel class of satellite agents . 1 . 4 Origin and evolution of viruses Viruses appear to infect every organism on earth , from the smallest bacteria to the largest mammals [ 21 ] . This perception suggests that viruses must have played an enormous role in the evolution of their hosts , by direct genetic interaction as well as by imposing selective pressure on their host cells and controlling population growth . Yet , the origin and evolution of viruses themselves represents a methodologically bigger challenge than the origin and evolution of cellular life . First , unlike cellular organism , viruses leave no fossil records which could be used for dating ancestral forms . Second , whereas bacteria , mammals , and all other cellular life forms have descended from a last universal common ancestor ( LUCA ) [ 115 , 116 ] and can be arranged in a tree - like fashion to represent their evolutionary descent , this is not possible for viruses . There is no single gene common to all viruses , which makes it impossible to reconstruct a phylogeny that would include all extant viruses . Instead , evolutionary virologists must restrict their analyses to subsets of viruses and use phylogenetic marker genes that are specific for these groups , e . g . the RNA - dependent RNA polymerase for positive - sense single - 12 stranded RNA viruses or DNA - dependent DNA polymerase B for NCLDVs . The extreme diversity of viruses , consisting of single - or double - stranded RNA or DNA genomes with various topologies , suggests that viruses are polyphyletic , i . e . they likely originated not just once , but multiple times . Hypotheses to explain the origin of viruses can be classified into three categories : ( i ) The reduction hypothesis states that viruses were once cellular organisms which became intracellular parasites and consequently lost all genes for energy metabolism and protein translation [ 26 , 117 , 118 ] . The major caveat of this hypothesis is the existence of viral genes that have no cellular homologues , including widely distributed ones such as capsid genes . Hence , the reduction hypothesis proposes that the cellular lineage from which viruses descended has gone extinct . ( ii ) The escape hypothesis can be viewed as the " traditional " model of viral evolution and assumes that viral genomes are derived from cellular genome fragments that became autonomous and infectious [ 83 , 117 , 119 ] . However , comparative viral genomics and the unresolved issue of the origin of the capsid protein argue against this scenario [ 48 ] . The escape model is still vividly defended by some researchers who argue , for instance , that genomes of giant DNA viruses such as Mimivirus evolved by extensive gene acquisition from cells [ 84 , 90 ] . ( iii ) The virus - first hypothesis suggests that viruses originated in a pre - cellular environment , and that viral genes that lack cellular homologues have originated in viruses [ 120 , 121 ] . This hypothesis differs from the first two scenarios in the existence of " true " viral genes , which have never been part of a cellular genome . Some of these exclusively viral genes are well conserved and found in a wide variety of viruses . They are called viral hallmark genes ( VHGs ) and include the jelly - roll capsid ( JRC ) protein , the superfamily 3 helicase , and at least six additional proteins involved in genome replication and packaging [ 48 ] . The JRC protein is an especially interesting case , as it is found in viruses infecting archaea , bacteria , and eukaryotes , which implies that viruses encoding the JRC gene are at least as old as LUCA and could even have descended from a single common ancestor [ 122 , 123 ] . On one hand , the capsid protein ( there are at least three major versions of it , the double - jelly roll or PRD1 fold , the HK97 fold , and the blue tongue virus fold [ 124 ] ) is the single unifying criterion that sets viruses apart from cells . Thus , Raoult and Forterre [ 85 ] proposed that the living world can be divided into ribosome - encoding organisms ( REOs , i . e . cells ) and capsid - encoding organisms ( CEOs , i . e . viruses ) . On the other hand , viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and their evolution is tightly linked to the evolution of their hosts . Any hypothesis about the origin of viruses should thus be viewed in the light of cellular evolution , and vice versa . A hypothesis of an ancient viral lineage that is based solely on structural comparison of a single protein such as the JRC protein , however , ignores the crucial context of cellular evolution and fails to explain the more 13 complex distribution patterns of other VHGs [ 48 ] . According to Koonin et al . , the existence of VHGs can be explained by an ancient virus world , in which the progenitors of modern cells were parasitized by primitive selfish genetic elements , which exchanged genes frequently and eventually invented the capsid protein to facilitate their horizontal transmission [ 48 ] . The nature of these parasitic agents changed with the evolutionary stage of their hosts , starting with RNA elements , and progressing via reverse - transcribing RNA / DNA elements to small DNA entities replicating through a rolling - circle mechanism , and finally to larger dsDNA viruses . This scenario implies that even the earliest stages of cellular evolution were tightly coupled with viral evolution . Because the currently predominant theory for the origin of eukaryotes posits a fusion between an archaeon and an α - proteobacterium [ 125 ] , the genomes of eukaryotic viruses are predicted to have arisen from a combination of mostly bacteriophage and some archaeal virus genes [ 48 ] . During the past few years , discoveries of giant viruses encoding translation proteins and other typically cellular genes [ 10 , 26 ] , combined with metagenomic studies revealing the vast abundance of viruses in the ocean [ 126 ] and new insights about beneficial roles of retroviral genes in our own genomes [ 127 , 128 ] , have caused a shift in the public perception about viruses , from mere agents of disease to active players in evolution and ecology . As an example , it has been pointed out by several authors that viruses should not be confused with virions ( i . e . the virus particle ) , and that the intracellular virion factory ( VF ) represents the main phase of the viral life cycle ( the viral " self " ) [ 118 , 129 - 131 ] . The debate about the nature of viruses culminated in the virocell concept , in which Forterre compares the VF to an intracellular parasite and views the infected cell as a living , membrane - bound , viral organism , called the virocell [ 131 ] . To summarize , multiple hypotheses have been formulated to explain the origin and evolution of viruses , but to date , none of them can provide a satisfactory answer to this complex problem . However , with a steadily increasing number of fully sequenced viral genomes , comparative viral genomics has the potential to shed more light on the fascinating topic of viral evolution . 1 . 5 Cafeteria roenbergensis virus 1 . 5 . 1 Cafeteria – a genus of heterotrophic nanoflagellates Heterotrophic flagellates are an integral part of the marine food web and dominate among protozoan grazers [ 132 , 133 ] . They feed mainly on bacteria but can also ingest small phytoplankton , cell fragments , larger viruses , and particulate organic matter [ 134 , 135 ] . 14 One of the most common and abundant heterotrophic nanoflagellates in marine environments is the genus Cafeteria with its type species C . roenbergensis , first described by Fenchel and Patterson in 1988 [ 136 ] . C . roenbergensis has been found in various habitats such as surface waters , deep sea sediments , and hydrothermal vents [ 137 , 138 ] . These 3 - 6 μm long , ellipsoid - shaped protozoa possess two flagella ; the anterior flagellum is used for forward - propelling motion , the posterior flagellum is used for attachment to substrates . C . roenbergensis is an interception feeder , i . e . it encounters its prey by active swimming and engulfs it via membrane invagination [ 139 , 140 ] . Cafeteria cells reproduce asexually by binary fission . Higher taxonomic classification places Cafeteria within the order Bicosoecales as part of the heterokonts ( also referred to as Stramenopiles ) , a diverse group of eukaryotes with phototrophic , heterotrophic , and mixotrophic members . According to Cavalier - Smith [ 141 ] , the Heterokonta belong to the kingdom Chromista , whose common ancestor acquired a red algal plastid that was consequently lost in several lineages . The protistan host for Cafeteria roenbergensis virus ( CroV ) was originally thought to belong to the genus Bodo [ 101 ] , but partial 18S rDNA sequencing revealed 100 % sequence identity to C . roenbergensis strain VENT1 [ 138 ] . A light microscopy image of C . roenbergensis strain E4 - 10 is shown in Fig . 1 . 1 . Figure 1 . 1 The heterotrophic nanoflagellate Cafeteria roenbergensis strain E4 - 10 . This light micrograph shows several cells of C . roenbergensis next to a patch of bacteria ( upper right ) . Note the two flagella emerging from the flattened side of the cell ( arrowheads ) .

Naoji Yubuki , University of British Columbia . 15 1 . 5 . 2 Viruses infecting Cafeteria roenbergensis Predation by protistan grazers is a major pathway of carbon transfer and nutrient recycling in marine and freshwater systems [ 132 ] ; yet , viruses infecting phagotrophic protists in marine systems are largely unknown and completely unexplored genetically . The large dsDNA virus that became known as CroV was originally isolated from Texas coastal waters in 1990 by M . Sc . student Randy Garza . In 1995 , Garza and Suttle reported the discovery of a large lytic virus that infected the heterotrophic nanoflagellate strains E1 and E4 [ 101 ] , which had been isolated from the Oregon coast [ 135 ] . They named this virus BV - PW1 , for Bodo Virus Pier Water isolate 1 . The icosahedral capsid had a diameter of 230 - 300 nm and contained dsDNA . The double - layered capsid contained an electron - dense core , and the presence of a lipid component was suggested by sensitivity of the virions to chloroform [ 101 ] . Virus particles accumulated in the cytoplasm of infected cells , with no evidence of nuclear assembly . Based on these observations , BV - PW1 was thought be a member of the NCLDV clade . A few years later , M . Sc . student Tanya St . John and Dr . Andrew Lang in the laboratory of Curtis Suttle developed a purification protocol for the virus and reported that the virion consisted of two major protein components with masses of 55 kDa and 65 kDa , and at least 30 minor proteins [ 142 ] . Pulsed - field gel electrophoresis of viral DNA suggested a genome size larger than 100 kbp and partial sequence analysis of a helicase gene amplified by random PCR hinted at African swine fever virus as the closest relative [ 142 ] . Although nothing is known about the ecology or biogeography of Cafeteria - infecting viruses , the finding that a virus isolated from the Gulf of Mexico was able to lyse a C . roenbergensis strain from the Oregon coast suggests that these viruses may be as widespread as their hosts . Furthermore , in a recent report , Massana et al . described the viral infection of a C . roenbergensis enrichment culture from the central Indian Ocean by large VLPs [ 143 ] . This is remarkable because the sample site was located in an oligotrophic region of the Indian Ocean with very little biomass available . Addition of low amounts of organic matter to 3 µm filtered surface seawater incubations stimulated the growth of bacteria and heterotrophic flagellates , and at day 4 of the incubation , Cafeteria roenbergensis dominated the cultures with up to 30 , 000 cells per ml . At day 5 , 72 % of the flagellates appeared infected by large ( ~ 280 nm diameter ) VLPs and at day 7 , the induced C . roenbergensis bloom had been terminated by the virus [ 143 ] . This demonstrates that viruses infecting C . roenbergensis are not only present in the Gulf of Mexico , but also occur in the Indian Ocean , which implies that populations of this heterotrophic nanoflagellate may be controlled by viruses worldwide . 16 1 . 6 Thesis objectives Based on preliminary results about CroV , which suggested that the virus might be a new representative of the NCLDV clade , further characterization promised to yield interesting results about CroV and viruses infecting marine protists . The overall goal of this dissertation was to present a detailed characterization of the novel marine virus CroV on different biological levels : the infection cycle , the genome , the transcriptome , and the virion proteome . During a late stage of the project , the discovery of the Mavirus virophage revealed an additional key aspect of CroV biology . This dissertation had the following objectives : 1 . Analysis of the CroV genome 2 . Analysis of the CroV transcriptome 3 . Analysis of the protein composition of the CroV particle 4 . Description of the CroV infection cycle 5 . Characterization of the CroV - associated virophage Mavirus To address these goals , the dissertation is structured as follows : Chapter 2 analyzes the 730 kbp genome sequence of CroV , explores the phylogenetic relationship of selected genes of interest , and makes use of microarray data to categorize CroV genes into early and late genes . Chapter 3 describes the protein composition of the CroV virion as determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry , and compares it to virion proteomes of other giant viruses . Chapter 4 describes the genome of the Mavirus virophage , a novel satellite virus that parasitizes CroV . This chapter also presents evidence for the viral transposogenesis hypothesis , stating that the Maverick / Polinton class of eukaryotic DNA transposons has originated from endogenization of ancient virophages related to Mavirus . Chapter 5 describes ultrastructural aspects of the infection cycles of CroV and Mavirus by using thin - section transmission electron microscopy . Chapter 6 integrates the results from genome , transcriptome , proteome , and ultrastructural analyses into a coherent picture about the biology of CroV and Mavirus and discusses some major implications arising from this work . 17 2 Genome Analysis of CroV 4 2 . 1 Synopsis This chapter describes the genome features of CroV , the first virus characterized to infect a marine zooplankton species . With ~ 730 kilobase pairs ( kbp ) of double - stranded ( ds ) DNA , CroV has the largest genome of any described marine virus and the second largest viral genome overall . The central 618 kbp coding part of this AT - rich genome contains 544 predicted protein - coding genes ; putative early and late promoter motifs have been detected and assigned to 191 and 72 genes , respectively . Microarray analysis showed that at least 274 genes were expressed during infection . The diverse coding potential of CroV includes predicted translation factors , DNA repair enzymes such as DNA mismatch repair protein MutS and two photolyases , multiple ubiquitin pathway components , four intein elements , and 22 tRNAs . Many genes including isoleucyl - tRNA synthetase , eIF - 2γ , and an Elp3 - like histone acetyltransferase have not been found before in a virus . A 38 kbp genomic region of putative bacterial origin was discovered , which encodes predicted carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes including an entire pathway for the biosynthesis of 3 - deoxy - D - manno - octulosonate , a key component of the outer membrane in Gram - negative bacteria . Phylogenetic analysis indicates that CroV is a nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus ( NCLDV ) and has Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus as its closest relative , although less than a third of its genes have homologues in Mimivirus . 2 . 2 Materials and methods 2 . 2 . 1 Flagellate growth and virus purification Cafeteria roenbergensis strain E4 - 10 was isolated from coastal waters near Yaquina Bay , OR , USA , as described previously [ 135 ] . Cultures of C . roenbergensis were grown in modified f / 2 enriched seawater medium which consisted of 8 . 25x10 - 6 M Na 2 EDTA , 8 . 25x10 - 6 M FeCl 3 - EDTA , 5 . 00x10 - 6 M K 2 HPO 4 , 5 . 50x10 - 4 M NaNO 3 , 1 . 00x10 - 8 M Na 2 SeO 3 , 3 . 93x10 - 8 M CuSO 4 , 5 . 87x10 - 9 M CuCl 2 , 2 . 60x10 - 8 M Na 2 MoO 4 , 7 . 65x10 - 8 M ZnSO 4 , 9 . 10x10 - 7 M MnCl 2 , 2 . 96x10 - 7 M thiamine , 2 . 05x10 - 9 M biotin , and 3 . 69x10 - 10 M cyanocobalamin in 30 kDa MWCO ultrafiltrated seawater of ~ 30 ppt salinity . Following autoclaving , the f / 2 medium was supplemented with 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) yeast extract ( Difco BD , Sparks , MD , USA ) to stimulate the growth of a mixed bacterial assembly that was present in the cultures . These marine bacteria grew to high concentrations of 4 A version of this chapter has been published : Fischer M . G . , Allen M . J . , Wilson W . H . and Suttle C . A .

Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 107 : 19508 - 19513 . 18 up to 5x10 8 cells / ml and served as the primary food source for C . roenbergensis . Cultures were kept at room temperature ( ~ 22°C ) in the dark . Typically , 250 ml of exponentially growing C . roenbergensis in one - litre plastic Erlenmeyer flasks were infected at a cell density of 5x10 4 cells / ml by adding 100 μ l ( ~ 0 . 01 multiplicity of infection [ MOI ] ) of CroV - containing crude lysate . Flagellate growth was monitored by staining cells with Lugol’s Acid Iodine and counting by light microscopy on a hemocytometer , which had a detection limit of 1x10 3 cells / ml . Lysates were centrifuged for 1 h at 10 , 500 x g in a Sorvall RC - 5C centrifuge ( GSA rotor , 4 ˚C ) to remove most bacteria and cell debris . The supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 150 , 000 x g in a Sorvall RC80 ultracentrifuge ( SW40 rotor , 20 ˚C ) . Pelleted material from ultracentrifugation was not immediately resuspended , but pellets from four to five consecutive ultracentrifuge runs were stacked for increased virus concentration . Pellets were resuspended in 0 . 2 - 0 . 5 ml sterile 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , loaded onto a 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 % ( w / v in 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 ) sucrose gradient , and centrifuged for 1 h at 70 , 000 x g in a Sorvall RC80 ultracentrifuge ( SW40 rotor , 20 ˚C ) . The 29 - 36 % sucrose fraction , containing the bulk of CroV particles , was extracted from the gradient , diluted 1 : 1 with sterile 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , and centrifuged for 1 h at 150 , 000 x g ( SW40 rotor , 20 ˚C ) . Virion pellets were resuspended in sterile 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 and stored at 4 ˚C . Glutaraldehyde - fixed ( 0 . 5 % w / v ) virus was quantified by epifluorescence microscopy ( SYBR Green I , Invitrogen ; Whatman Anodisc filter membranes , VWR Canada ) as described [ 144 ] . Figure 2 . 1 Denaturation of CroV particles . ( A ) Intact CroV virions before treatment . ( B ) CroV virions after 20 hours at 55°C in the presence of 1 % ( w / v ) lauroylsarcosine . Long strands of free viral genomic DNA are intermingled with remaining intact particles ( arrowheads ) . ( C ) CroV virions after 20 hours at 55°C in the presence of 1 % ( w / v ) lauroylsarcosine and 1 mg / ml Proteinase K . The combination of heat , detergent , and Proteinase K resulted in complete denaturation of the virions . All treatments were performed in 20 µl reactions which were then filtered onto 0 . 02 μm pore size , 25 mm diameter Anodisc Al 2 O 3 filters and subsequently stained with SYBR Green I and examined at 500 - fold magnification under an epifluorescence microscope . 19 Purified CroV particles were suspended in L buffer ( 0 . 01 M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 0 . 1 M EDTA , 0 . 02 M NaCl ) containing 1 % ( w / v ) N - lauroylsarcosine and 1 mg / ml Proteinase K and incubated at 55 ˚C for at least 12 h . Treatment by heat and detergent in the absence of Proteinase K resulted in only partial virion denaturation , as shown in Fig . 2 . 1 . DNA was extracted with equal volumes of phenol ( once ) , phenol / chloroform ( 1 : 1 , once ) and chloroform / isoamylalcohol ( 24 : 1 , twice ) . The DNA was precipitated with 0 . 06 volumes of 5 M NaCl and 2 volumes of - 20 ˚C 100 % ethanol . After centrifugation , the DNA pellet was dissolved in nuclease - free molecular grade water ( Invitrogen , Burlington , ON , Canada ) . Quantification and quality control were performed on a Nanodrop spectrophotometer . Alternative virus purification and DNA extraction methods are described in section 3 . 2 . 1 . 2 . 2 . 2 Pulsed - field gel electrophoresis of CroV genomic DNA Chromosome length was analyzed by pulsed - field gel electrophoresis ( PFGE ) . Approximately 5x10 8 virions ( purified by density gradient centrifugation ) were embedded in 1 % ( w / v ) low - melting agarose ( Invitrogen ) in L buffer ( 0 . 01 M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 0 . 1 M EDTA , 0 . 02 M NaCl ) . The gel plug was incubated in L buffer supplemented with 1 % ( w / v ) lauroylsarcosine and 1 mg / ml Proteinase K , at 50°C overnight to release the viral genome from the capsid . The gel plug was then washed three times with 1x TE , pH 7 . 6 for 30 minutes each and once with 0 . 5x TBE and sealed in a 1 % ( w / v ) agarose gel in 0 . 5x TBE . PFGE run conditions were 25 hours at 200 V ( 6 V / cm ) and 14°C , with 60 - 120 sec switch times at a 120° angle and a ramping factor of 16 . 17 using a BioRad DR2 CHEF unit . DNA bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining . Analysis of the genome conformation and verification of the final sequence assembly was done by whole - genome restriction digests with Fsp I , Apa I , and Sac II ( all from NEB Canada ) , followed by PFGE separation of fragments . For each restriction digest , ~ 5x10 9 virions were embedded in low - melting agarose and processed as described above . After the first TE washing step , the plugs were washed twice in TE , pH 7 . 6 , 1 mM PMSF for 1 h , once in TE , pH 7 . 6 for 30 min , and once in the respective NEB restriction enzyme buffer for 30 min on ice . The gel plugs wer e then added to 0 . 2 ml of the respective restriction digest buffer with 100 μg / ml BSA and 20 units of the respective restriction enzyme . After 20 min incubation at room temperature , the gel plugs were incubated at the recommended temperature for 6 h and then for another 8 h in a fresh reaction mixture . Following digestion , gel plugs were incubated for 2 h at 50°C in 300 μl of L buffer with 1 mg / ml Proteinase K . Gel plugs were rinsed three times with 1x TBE and sealed in a 1 % agarose gel . PFGE conditions were as described above , with run and switch times varying according to DNA fragment lengths . 20 2 . 2 . 3 Genome sequencing and assembly High - throughput pyrosequencing on a GS 20 platform ( 454 Life Sciences , Branford , CT , USA ) of 5 . 4 μ g CroV DNA resulted in 543 , 864 individual sequence reads with a run size of 64 . 5 megabases and an average read length of 119 bp . For de novo assembly , Newbler TM Assembler software ( 454 Life Sciences ) was used to generate 49 large contigs , 716 - 65 , 787 bp in length . The average sequence coverage of the contigs was 39 - fold . The 48 large GS 20 contigs that were associated with CroV comprised 592 , 883 bp of non - redundant sequence , with an average contig size of 12 , 352 bp . Additional pyrosequencing was performed on a GS FLX platform with Titanium chemistry ( McGill University and Génome Québec Innovation Centre , Montréal , QC , Canada ) using 7 . 0 μ g of CroV DNA . Pyrosequencing on 1 / 8 of a picotiter plate resulted in 74 , 111 individual sequence reads with a total data volume of 27 . 4 megabases and an average read length of 370 bp . GS De Novo Assembler Software created 44 large contigs , 504 - 112 , 465 bp in length , with an average coverage of 38 - fold . The 38 large GS FLX contigs that were associated with the CroV genome comprised 601 , 547 bp of non - redundant sequence , with an average contig size of 15 , 797 bp . To span the inter - contig regions , multiple oligonucleotide primers were designed for each contig end , their 3’ ends distally oriented . Different primer combinations were used in multiplex polymerase chain reactions ( PCR ) containing up to 12 different primers . Reactions yielding one or more distinct bands were repeated with smaller subsets of the original primer mix to identify which primers were responsible for the PCR product . Once identified , resulting products were sequenced at the University of British Columbia ' s Nucleic Acid and Protein Service Facility ( Vancouver , BC , Canada ) using BigDye V3 . 1 chemistry . In addition , alternative assemblies were created ( Sequencher v4 . 8 , Gene Codes , Ann Arbor , MI , U . S . A . ) . Any predicted contig connections were tested by PCR and , if a distinct PCR product was obtained , confirmed by sequencing . PCR assays were conducted in 25 µl or 50 µl reactions , containing 1 - 2 pg / µl CroV genomic DNA , 1 µM of each primer , 1 . 5 µM MgCl 2 ( up to 4 . 5 µM in multiplex reactions ) , 0 . 2 mM dNTPs , 0 . 02 U / µl Platinum Taq DNA polymerase ( Invitrogen ) , and 1x Platinum Taq reaction buffer . Thermocycling protocols consisted of 5 min at 95°C ( 1 cycle ) ; 30 sec at 95°C , 1 min at a suitable annealing temperature ( usually 53 - 56°C ) , 3 min at 72°C with a maximum heating rate of 1°C / sec ( 35 cycles ) ; 12 min at 72°C ( 1 cycle ) , and cooling at 4°C . A list of primer sequences is available in Appendix D . Several regions of the final genome assembly , mainly those containing DNA repeats as well as all contig breakpoints , were re - sequenced to increase coverage . A small insert shotgun library was created to aid in genome sequencing and turned 21 out be valuable for assembly of the tRNA gene cluster , as these sequences were absent from 454 contigs , but were overrepresented in clone libraries . Thirty micr oliters of 150 ng / μl CroV genomic DNA were added to 750 μl of 10 % ( w / v ) glycerol in TE , pH 8 . 0 , and sheared by nebulization according to the manufacturer ' s instructions ( Invitrogen , Burlington , ON , Canada ) . The sheared DNA was RNaseI treated ( NEB , Canada ) , end - repaired ( DNATerminator Kit , Lucigen , Middleton , WI , USA ) , separated on an agarose gel and the 1 - 5 kbp size fraction was extracted . Blunt - ended fragments were ligated into the pSMART - LCKan vector ( Lucigen ) . Plasmids from 288 recombinant Escherichia coli clones were isolated and bi - directionally sequenced . The creation of large insert libraries ( pCC1FOS vector [ ~ 40 kbp insert size ] , CopyControl Fosmid Library Production Kit , Epicentre , Madison , WI , USA ; and pJAZZ - KA vector [ 10 - 20 kbp insert size ] , Lucigen ) was unsuccessful despite positive tests with provided insert DNA and the successful cloning of phage307 genome fragments ( phage307 is described in Appendix E ) . 2 . 2 . 4 Genome annotation Artemis software v12 . 0 [ 145 ] was used for genome annotation . CDSs predicted and numbered by Artemis were compared to those predicted by the EMBOSS application GETORF [ 146 ] . A CDS was defined as being initiated by a start codon and terminated by a stop codon , with a minimum length of 50 uninterrupted consecutive codons ( with the exception of crov299a which was only 47 codons long , see section 3 . 3 . 1 ) . CDSs overlapping with a larger CDS or exhibiting a strongly biased amino acid composition were removed . Alternative start codons ( ATA , ATT ) were used to initiate a few apparent CDSs that lacked an initiator methionine . This was the case for crov004 , crov025 , crov066 , crov070 , crov158 , crov184 , crov251 , crov258 , crov348 , crov355 , crov438 , crov441 , crov511 , crov521 , and crov524 . Translated CDSs were searched against the NCBI non - redundant ( nr ) database using BLASTP [ 147 ] with an E - value cutoff of 10 - 5 , and the COG database [ 148 ] was searched using the NCBI BLAST option " search for conserved domains " . Functional annotation resulted from integrating BLAST results with conserved protein domains identified via the Pfam [ 149 ] and InterPro [ 150 ] databases . In cases where these predictions were still ambiguous or inconclusive , multiple sequence alignments with putative homologues were created to infer functional predictions ( e . g . crov492 , Rpb9 ) . For NCVOG analysis , a BLASTP search of CroV CDSs was conducted against a database containing all NCLDV proteins used by Yutin et al . 5 5 downloaded from ftp : / / ftp . ncbi . nih . gov / pub / wolf / COGs / NCVOG [ 51 ] . Hits with E - values < 10 - 5 were assigned to their respective NCVOGs . Putative tRNA genes were identified with tRNAscan - SE using the general 22 tRNA model [ 151 ] ; codon analysis was carried out using CodonW 6 2 . 2 . 5 Phylogenetic analysis . Inteins were identified in BLAST searches based on gaps in alignments with intein - free homologues . Detailed sequence alignments with allelic inteins and identification of conserved amino acids corroborated the annotation as theoretical inteins . Before calculation of the average size of intergenic regions , the two - tailed 5 % most extreme data points were trimmed off . Promoter analysis was carried out by examining the 100 nt regions immediately upstream of CroV CDSs using MEME [ 153 ] . MEME analysis returned the putative early promoter motif with the consensus sequence " AAAAATTGA " . The position of this motif relative to the start codon was defined as the number of nucleotides between the first adenine in AAAAATTGA and the first nucleotide of the predicted start codon . Next , I searched for a potential late promoter motif in the 100 nt upstream regions of selected CDSs predicted to encode structural components : major capsid protein ( crov342 ) , major core protein ( crov332 ) , capsid protein 2 ( crov398 ) , capsid protein 3 ( crov321 ) , capsid protein 4 ( crov176 ) , and a phage tail collar domain - containing protein ( crov148 ) . With the exception of crov176 , all these CDSs were preceded by a perfectly conserved " TCTA " motif that was flanked by AT - rich sequences ( containing up to 1 G or C in the 11 nt upstream of TCTA and up to 3 G or C in the 10 nt downstream of TCTA ) . The TCTA motif was located 11 - 20 nt upstream of the predicted start codon ( as defined by the number of nucleotides between the first thymidine of TCTA and the first nucleotide of the predicted start codon ) . Based on this sequence profile , I examined the 30 nt upstream region of the 124 late genes for further occurrences of the motif using MEME . Consensus sequence logos were created with WebLogo [ 154 ] . For phylogenetic reconstruction , the taxonomic distribution of the query protein was examined using the InterPro database [ 150 ] . Putative homologues were identified by separate BLASTP searches against viruses , eukaryotes , bacteria , and archaea , or , where necessary , taxonomic subgroups thereof . Upon visual inspection of the potential homologues , a representative set of sequences was selected for further analysis . Alternatively , some sequences were downloaded directly via their GenBank accession numbers or keyword searches . Multiple sequence alignments were created using MUSCLE [ 155 ] , followed by manual refinement . Maximum likelihood ( ML ) trees were generated on the phylogeny . fr webserver [ 156 ] or the PHYML webserver [ 157 ] . Bayesian Inference ( BI ) analysis as implemented in MrBayes v3 . 1 . 2 [ 158 ] was carried out with gamma rates and the mixed amino acid model . MrBayes was run for at least 1 million generations or until the standard deviation of split frequencies was less than 0 . 01 . BI 6 http : / / mobyle . pasteur . fr / cgi - bin / MobylePortal / portal . py ? form = codonw 23 trees were generated by the majority rule consensus method , which produces an output tree that contains only nodes that are present in at least half of the input trees . 2 . 2 . 6 Microarray analysis 7 To create the microarray , PICKY software [ 159 ] was used to design one 50 - 70 bp long oligonucleotide each for 438 of the 544 predicted CroV CDSs . The remaining CDSs had either not yet been annotated or were too repetitive for unique probe design . The oligonucleotide probes were printed onto amino silane treated glass slides using a BioRobotics MicroGrid 2 printer . Each virus - specific probe was printed in five replicates along with several negative and positive control probes ( " spot aliens " and " landing lights " ) . RNA extraction Total RNA was extracted from host cells that had been infected with CroV at an MOI of ~ 2 as well as from an uninfected control culture . The uninfected control hybridization consisted of one biological replicate and five technical replicates , and the sole purpose of hybridizing mRNA from uninfected cultures to the CroV microarray was to detect cases where host mRNA cross - hybridized with the virus - specific probes . Six flasks each containing 600 ml of an exponentially growing C . roenbergensis culture were infected with CroV lysate at a cell density of 1x10 5 per ml . Subsamples of 300 ml were taken at T = 0 ( immediately after infection ) , 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 , and 72 h p . i . . It should be noted that although the CroV infection cycle lasted 12 - 18 hours , cultures frequently contained living cells up to 5 days post infection . This was due to the low MOI used , which required more than one round of infection to lyse all cells in the culture . C . roenbergensis cells were pelleted by centrifugation ( 1 , 500 x g , 15 min , 20°C , Eppendorf A - 4 - 62 rotor ) , pellets were washed in 2 x 40 ml PBS and centrifuged again . Cells were then resuspended in 2 ml RNAlater solution ( Qiagen , Mississauga , ON , Canada ) and stored at - 80°C until further use . RNA extraction was performed using an RNAeasy Protect Midi Kit ( Qiagen ) . Each sample was split into two RNase - free 2 ml microfuge tubes , centrifuged ( 12 , 000 x g , 5 min ) and the pellets resuspended in 2 x 2 ml RLT buffer containing 20 μl β - mercaptoethanol . After vortexing 10 times for 10 sec each , samples were centrifuged ( 20 , 000 x g , 5 min ) and the supernatant was transferred to a 15 ml Falcon tube containing 4 ml of 70 % ethanol . Following vigorous shaking the samples were applied to an RNAeasy Midi column , centrifuged ( 3 , 220 x g , 10 min , 22°C ) and the flow - through was discarded . This process was repeated once until the entire sample had been applied to the column . Columns were washed once with 4 ml RW1 7 Microarray analysis was carried under supervision of Dr . Michael J . Allen in the laboratory of Dr . William H . Wilson at the Plymouth Marine Laboratories , United Kingdom . 24 buffer ( 3 , 220 x g , 5 min ) , twice with RPE buffer ( 3 , 220 x g , 5 min ) and transferred to a new Falcon tube . To elute the RNA , 250 μl RNase - free water was added to the column ; samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 min and centrifuged ( 3 , 220 x g , 5 min ) . The elution process was repeated once and both eluates were combined in a final volume of 0 . 5 ml . RNA was precipitated by adding 250 μl of 7 . 5 M NH 4 Ac and 1 ml of 100 % ethanol and incubating the samples at - 80°C overnight . Following centrifugation ( 20 , 000 x g , 30 min ) , the pellet was washed twice with 0 . 5 ml 80 % ethanol ( 20 , 000 x g , 30 min ) . The pellet was air dried , resuspended in 50 μl RNase - free water and stored at - 80°C . RNA quantity and quality were assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system ( www . agilent . com ) . DNase treatment of total RNA 10 μ l of total RNA , 2 . 5 μ l of Turbo DNase buffer ( 10x , Ambion , UK ) and 2 . 5 μ l of Turbo DNase ( 2 U / μ l , Ambion , UK ) were combined in a total volume of 25 μ l and incubated at 37 ˚C for 15 min . Following the addition of 5 μ l DNase inactivation reagent 8174G ( Ambion , UK ) and mixing , the samples were incubated at room temperature for 3 min , centrifuged ( 14 , 000 x g , 1 min ) , and the supernatant was transferred to a new RNase - free microfuge tube . cDNA synthesis The Microarray Target Amplification Kit ( Roche , UK ) was used for cDNA synthesis . For each of the 10 samples , 500 ng total RNA ( DNase treated ) , 0 . 5 ng spike mRNA ( mRNA spikes 1 + 2 , Stratagene , UK ) , and 1 μ g TAS - T7 Oligo dT were combined in a total volume of 10 . 5 μ l , mixed briefly , and incubated at 70 ˚C for 10 min . A reaction mix containing 4 μ l 5x first strand buffer , 2 μ l 0 . 1 M DTT , 2 μ l 10 mM dNTP mix , and 1 . 5 μ l reverse transcriptase ( 17 U / μ l ) was added and samples were incubated at 42ºC for 2 hours followed by 95ºC for 5 min and cooling on ice . For second strand synthesis , a reaction mix was added to a final volume of 50 μ l containing 2 . 5 μ l dNTP mix ( 10 mM ) , 5 μ l TAS - ( dN ) 10 primer ( 100 μ M ) , 5 μ l Klenow Reaction Buffer ( 10x ) , and 4 μ l Klenow enzyme ( 2 U / μ l ) . After brief mixing , the reaction was incubated at 37ºC for 30 min . Following the addition of 1 . 25 μ l carrier RNA ( 0 . 8 μ g / μ l ) and 50 μ l RNase - free water , cDNA was purified using the Microarray Target Purification Kit ( Roche , UK ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . cDNA was PCR - amplified using the following reaction setup : 12 . 5 μ l purified double - stranded cDNA , 1 μ l TAS primer ( 50 μ M ) , 2 μ l dNTP mix ( 10 mM ) , 10 μ l Expand PCR buffer ( 10x ) , 1 . 5 μ l Expand enzyme mix ( 3 . 5 U / μ l ) , 73 μ l RNase - free water . PCR conditions were as follows : one cycle of 2 min at 95ºC and 24 cycles of 30 sec at 95ºC , 30 sec at 55ºC , 3 min at 72ºC . PCR products were purified using the Microarray Target Purification Kit ( Roche ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and concentrated on a Microcon YM - 30 column ( Millipore , UK ) to a final volume of 10 . 75 μ l . 25 Labelling of cDNA with fluorescent dyes PCR - amplified cDNA was labelled with Cy3 by in vitro transcription using the Microarray Target Synthesis Kit ( Roche , UK ) . 10 . 75 μ l of template DNA were combined with 2 μ l DTT ( 100 mM ) , 1 μ l NTP mix ( 25 mM ATP , 25 mM CTP , 25 mM GTP , 18 . 75 mM UTP ) , 1 . 25 μ l Cy3 - 17 - UTP ( 5 mM , Amersham , UK ) , 2 μ l transcription buffer ( 10x ) and 3 μ l transcription enzyme blend . The reaction was incubated for 16 hours at 37ºC and Cy3 - labelled cRNA was purified using the Microarray Target Purification Kit ( Roche , UK ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Microarray hybridization and data analysis Prior to hybridization , glass slides were incubated at 42ºC for 3 hours with gentle agitation in a solution containing 1 % BSA ( PAA Laboratories , UK ) , 5x SSC ( Sigma , UK ) , and 0 . 1 % SDS . For hybridization , 9 μl 20x SSC , 1 . 2 μl 10 % SDS , and the labelled cRNA samples were combined in a total volum e of 60 μl and prewarmed to 60 ºC . Samples were loaded onto the microarray slide covered by a Lifterslip ( Erie Scientific Company , UK ) and hybridization was performed in a microarray hybrid chamber ( Camlab , UK ) at 60ºC for 20 hours . Microarray slides were scanned using an Affymetrix 418 Array Scanner with GMS Scanner software v1 . 51 . 0 . 42 . Scans were performed at 10 gain increments to determine the optimal scanning range for signal distribution . CroV genomic DNA labelled with Cy3 - dCTP ( GE Healthcare , UK ) was used to test the microarray . To assign a preliminary transcription activity status to each CroV gene , probe spots were individually assessed using a manual scoring system [ 160 ] performed on the original microarray images ( ImaGene 5 . 6 . 1 , BioDiscovery , UK ) . In order to separate signal from background noise , normalized fluorescence signals were plotted with increasing values to yield an intensity distribution plot such as the one shown in Fig . 2 . 2 . The signal threshold was then set manually in a region where the intensity values started to increase exponentially . A CDS was considered to be expressed if an above background signal was detected in at least 3 of the 5 replicate spots within an array of one of the 9 time points and if the respective spot did not produce a signal when hybridized with labelled cRNA isolated from the uninfected control culture . These values were chosen based on experience from previous microarray studies [ 160 ] . Very few genes belonged to the 3 / 5 category and only four of them ( crov045 , crov062 , crov220 , crov223 ) were considered to be expressed based on a 3 / 5 condition . Microarray experimentation and data were collected to be MIAME compliant . 26 Figure 2 . 2 Fluorescence intensity profile and threshold settings for a typical microarray hybridization . This profile shows the signal intensity distribution of a hybridization profile , for which the significance threshold was set to 300 units . The inset shows a magnification of the same profile to better visualize that the threshold was set in a region where the signal distribution became exponential . Host strain18S Sequencing Eukaryotic 18S rDNA fragments were amplified from C . roenbergensis using universal eukaryotic primers Euk1A and Euk516r as previously described [ 161 ] . PCR products were cloned into the pCR4 - TOPO vector ( Invitrogen , Burlington , ON , Canada ) and sequenced at the University of British Columbia ' s Nucleic Acid and Protein Service Facility ( Vancouver , BC , Canada ) using BigDye V3 . 1 chemistry . Data deposition The sequences reported in this chapter have been deposited in the GenBank database [ accession numbers GU244497 ( CroV genome ) and GU249597 ( partial 18S sequence from C . roenbergensis strain E4 - 10 ) ] . The microarray data reported in this paper have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) database 8 under the accession number GSE19051 . The four CroV intein sequences have been submitted to InBase , the NEB intein database 9 . 8 http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo 9 http : / / www . neb . com / neb / inteins . html 27 2 . 3 Results and discussion 2 . 3 . 1 General genome features The CroV genome is a dsDNA molecule with a size of ~ 730 kbp , as determined by PFGE analysis ( Figs . 2 . 3 , 2 . 4 ) , making this the second largest sequenced viral genome after Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus . The CroV genome was sequenced by 454 pyro - sequencing and assembled de novo using GS assembly software in combination with other methods ( see section 2 . 2 . 3 and Appendix A for details ) . The viral chromosome consists of a central 618 kbp protein - coding part , which is flanked on both ends by extensive regions of putatively repetitive nature ( Fig . 2 . 5 ) . These terminal regions could potentially serve as protective caps for the protein - coding part of the genome , akin to telomeres in eukaryotes . The CroV genome is AT - rich ( 76 . 6 % A + T ) , which is reflected in the distribution of codons and in the overall amino acid ( aa ) composition . AT - rich codons are consistently preferred over GC - rich ones , with the four most frequent aa ( Lys , Ile , Asn , and Leu ) each representing about 10 % of the overall aa ( Fig . 2 . 6 ) . Whole - genome restriction analysis was carried out to determine whether the genome had linear or circular topology ( Fig . 2 . 4 ) . Purified virus particles were embedded in agarose blocks and the viral genome was released by protease / detergent / heat treatment ( Fig . 2 . 1 ) . In - gel digestion was then performed separately using three different restriction endonucleases : Apa I was predicted to cut the genome at two positions , and Fsp I and Sac II were predicted to cut the genome once each ( Table 2 . 1 ) . Restriction digests were analyzed by PFGE , as shown in Fig . 2 . 4 . Due to the wide size range of predicted DNA fragments , the gel was run in three consecutive steps , with photographs taken after each completed step . Whereas Apa I digested the genome quantitatively ( note the absence of a full - length genomic band in Fig . 2 . 4C ) , Fsp I had a cut efficiency of less than 100 % ( some undigested DNA visible , band 4 in Fig . 2 . 4C ) and Sac II had very poor cut efficiency ( most of the DNA remained undigested , band 10 in Fig . 2 . 4C ) . These partial restriction digests may be caused by methylation of the CroV genome , as the virus encodes several predicted methyltransferases ( see section 2 . 3 . 5 ) . Due to prolonged times of electrophoresis , staining , and destaining , as well as the large amount of DNA used to ensure good band visibility , the size estimates resulting from this restriction digest were afflicted with large error margins . Therefore , the pulsed - field gel shown in Fig . 2 . 3 , which had a much better resolution , was used to estimate the genome size at 730 kbp . 28 Nevertheless , all three restriction digests shown in Fig . 2 . 4 confirmed the linearity of the CroV genome , as two restriction fragments were observed for enzymes that cut the genome once , and three restriction fragments were observed for Apa I which had two predicted target sites in the CroV genome ( Table 2 . 1 ) .

This codon analysis is based on 185 , 006 codons in 544 CDSs ( stop codons excluded ) . Codons consisting 100 % of ( A or U ) are coloured in red , 67 % ( A or U ) in yellow , 33 % ( A or U ) in green , 0 % ( A or U ) in blue . The height of each codon column represents the overall frequency of that codon . Using conservative annotation criteria ( see section 2 . 2 . 4 ) , I identified 544 putative protein - coding sequences ( CDSs ) and 22 transfer RNA ( tRNA ) genes in the 618 kbp central region of the CroV genome , which has a coding density of 90 . 1 % , or 0 . 88 CDSs per kb . The average CDS is 1025 nucleotides ( nt ) or 342 aa in length , and coding capacities range from 47 to 3 , 337 aa . The forward strand contains 290 CDSs and all 22 tRNA genes , the reverse strand encodes 254 CDSs . Applying a BLASTP E - value cutoff of 10 - 5 , 267 CDSs ( 49 % ) displayed similarity to sequences in GenBank and 134 CDSs ( 25 % ) were assigned to one or more Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins ( COGs , E - value < 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 2 . 7 ) . The most common COG categories are DNA replication & repair , protein modification & chaperones , and transcription . The least represented categories are energy production & conversion , cell division & chromosome partitioning , and signal transduction mechanisms . Given the parasitic lifestyle of viruses , this distribution is not surprising ; however , it was unexpected to find 14 CDSs assigned to " translation , ribosomal structure and biogenesis " . Appendix B contains a detailed list of all 544 CDSs , their physical properties and predicted functions . 33 Figure 2 . 7 Functional categories of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins ( COGs ) identified in CroV . Colour code : blue , information storage and processing ; red , cellular processes ; green , metabolism - related categories ; black , poorly characterised categories . Figure 2 . 8 Distribution of top BLASTP hits for CroV CDSs . All 544 CroV CDSs were queried against the NCBI non - redundant database and categorized according to the domain affiliation of their top BLASTP hit . The E - value cutoff for this analysis was 10 - 5 . 34 Based on the distribution of top BLASTP hits , about half of the CroV genes displayed similarities to proteins found in eukaryotes , bacteria , archaea and other giant viruses ( Fig . 2 . 8 ) . Twenty - two percent of CroV CDSs had their top BLASTP hit among eukaryotes , but in the absence of genomic information about C . roenbergensis , no statement can be made about potential gene transfer between CroV and its host . Although most CroV CDSs were of unknown function , 32 % of CDSs could be assigned a putative function and they provide insights into the biology of this giant virus . Several of these enzymatic functions have not been reported to be encoded by any other virus ( Table 2 . 2 ) . Owing to the large number of proteins found in CroV , only a fraction of them can be discussed within the scope of this thesis . The following sections provide an overview of the most important enzymatic functions encoded by this new giant virus . Table 2 . 2 Novel viral features in the CroV genome .

CroV encodes an isoleucyl - tRNA synthetase ( IleRS ) and putative homologues of eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF - 1 , eIF - 2α , eIF - 2β / eIF - 5 , eIF - 2γ , eIF - 4AIII , eIF - 4E , and eIF - 5B . Initiation is the rate - limiting step of translation and is thus tightly regulated . During initiation , viral mRNAs compete with cellular transcripts for ribosome binding [ 162 ] . In fact , all of the CroV - encoded eIFs are involved in the formation of the 43S preinitiation complex , which consists of the 40S ribosomal subunit and eIFs 1 , 1A , 2 , 3 , and 5 [ 163 ] . This multimeric complex binds to the 5’ - cap structure of mRNAs via eIF - 4E , eIF - 4G , and eIF - 4A and then scans the 5’ - UTR for an AUG start codon , a process that is mediated by eIF - 1 . During the scanning phase , the initiator methionyl tRNA is bound to the GTP - bound form of the heterotrimer eIF - 2 ( composed of α , β and γ subunits ) . Experiments in yeast have shown that mutations in eIF - 1 can lead to recognition of non - AUG start codons [ 164 ] . The CroV - encoded eIF - 1 homologue may thus be capable of recognizing non - canonical start codons , which are postulated for 15 CroV CDSs ( see section 2 . 2 . 4 ) . The translation initiation factors found in CroV could thus potentially replace host factors in the 43S preinitiation complex and shift the specificity of mRNA recognition from host transcripts towards viral transcripts . A role of the CroV capping enzyme in the viral mRNA recognition process via CroV - specific 5 ' cap structures is also possible . The evolutionary origin of the CroV translation - associated genes is not clear . Among these genes , the predicted IleRS encoded by crov505 showed the highest conservation to cellular homologues and was chosen for phylogenetic analysis . As shown in the phylogenetic tree in Fig . 2 . 9 , the CroV IleRS homologue does not seem to be the result of horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) from a eukaryotic host , because it branches basally to eukaryotes . Although viruses in general are known to have accelerated mutation rates , a recent study has shown that the evolutionary rates in three large dsDNA viruses are comparable to those in vertebrates [ 165 ] . Hence , it is unlikely that increased mutation rates account for the observed distance of CroV IleRS and eukaryotic homologues . The CroV genome encodes 22 tRNA genes , as predicted by the transfer RNA gene prediction software tRNAScan - SE . The tRNA genes are clustered in a 2 . 8 kbp region around position 510 , 000 ( Table 2 . 3 , Figs . 2 . 5 , 2 . 10 ) and have the following aa specificites : 9x Leu ( TAA ) , 5x Ser ( CGA ) , 3x Lys ( TTT ) , 1x Tyr ( GTA ) , 1x Asn ( GTT ) , 1 ochre stop codon suppressor tRNA and 2 tRNAs of unknown specificity , one of which could be specific for isoleucine , containing a deletion in the anticodon loop ( tRNA No . 9 in Table 2 . 3 ) . The tRNA gene cluster seems to have 36 expanded by gene duplication , as some blocks of tRNA genes are present in multiple copies , such as the sequence Leu - Ser - Leu - Lys , which occurs three times in the tRNA gene cluster ( Fig . 2 . 10 , Table 2 . 3 ) . The finding of an IleRS gene and 22 tRNA genes may reflect the importance of the respective aa in the viral infection cycle . Figure 2 . 9 Phylogenetic analysis of isoleucyl - tRNA synthetases .

Although these results seem to imply a relationship between codon usage and translational genes in CroV , it is not known whether the tRNA genes are expressed or functional ; thus , their anticodons could also be a result of mutational adaptation to the high AT content of the CroV genome . In Mimivirus , no correlation is observed between codon usage and virus - encoded aminoacyl - tRNA synthetases or tRNAs [ 59 ] . Further CroV CDSs with predicted functions in protein biosynthesis are two tRNA - modifying enzymes , tRNA pseudouridine 5S synthase and tRNA Ile lysidine synthetase . These genes add to a still exclusive , but rapidly growing number of virus - encoded protein translation components . Some tRNA genes are scattered among bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses such as the phycodnaviruses [ 58 , 166 ] , and four tRNA synthetases along with several putative translation factors are found in Mimivirus [ 26 ] . These findings imply that CroV and similarly complex viruses encode genes to modify and regulate the host translation system to their own advantage which results in a " life style " that is less dependent on host cell components than those of smaller viruses . 2 . 3 . 3 DNA repair genes The ability to repair various kinds of DNA damage is well documented among large dsDNA viruses [ 167 - 169 ] . Given that the AT - rich genome of CroV is exposed to high solar irradiance in surface waters of the ocean and is therefore likely to suffer from DNA lesions such as pyrimidine dimers , it is not surprising that CroV encodes several DNA repair proteins . Putative components of several DNA repair pathways were identified , including a presumably complete base excision repair ( BER ) pathway with formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase , a family 1 apurinic / apyrimidinic ( AP ) endonuclease , a family X DNA polymerase , and an NAD - dependent DNA ligase . Oxidative stress may lead to modification of DNA bases , which can result in mutations during DNA replication . The BER pathway is able to reverse these harmful modifications . The formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase could initiate BER by cleaving the N - glycosidic bond of oxidized purines , creating an AP site . AP endonuclease would then cleave the phosphodiester backbone at AP sites . A DNA polymerase such as the family B or family X enzymes encoded by CroV might fill in the resulting gap and the NAD - dependent ligase would seal the sugar - phosphate backbone . CroV may thus be able to catalyze the entire BER pathway by relying exclusively on enzymes encoded by its own genome . 39 The CroV AP endonuclease is the first viral homologue in this family and its phylogenetic position between eukaryotes and archaea / bacteria makes it unlikely that this gene has been recently acquired by HGT ( Fig . 2 . 11 ) . Figure 2 . 11 Phylogenetic analysis of AP endonucleases . This Bayesian reconstruction of AP endonuclease phylogeny is based on a 168 aa alignment and is shown as a radial tree to emphasize the central branching point of the CroV protein .

The bacterial mismatch repair ATPase MutS ( crov486 ) marks an interesting case , as it is only the second instance of a virally encoded MutS protein . The first viral MutS homologue was found in Mimivirus and turned out to be most closely related to a group of corals , the Octocorallia , who uniquely encode this gene in their mitochondrial genomes and probably acquired it by HGT from ε - proteobacteria [ 170 , 171 ] . Although the CroV version is closely related to the Mimivirus MutS ( BLASTP E - value 10 - 112 , 31 % similarity over 1035 aa ) , phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that CroV MutS has a more basal branching position , as shown in the Bayesian Inference tree in Fig . 2 . 12 . This suggests that a giant virus that was more closely related to Mimivirus than to CroV may have mediated the HGT from bacteria to corals [ 170 ] . However , Mimivirus is no longer the only virus encoding a MutS protein and giant viruses may represent a reservoir and , given the deep branching position of CroV MutS , perhaps even a source of cellular DNA repair genes . Figure 2 . 12 Phylogenetic analysis of MutS ATPases . Unrooted Bayesian Inference tree of a 374 aa alignment of MutS DNA mismatch repair proteins . Archaea are coloured orange , bacteria blue , and eukaryotes green . Nodes are labelled with posterior probabilities and GenBank accession numbers are given for each sequence . 41 The presence of two photolyase genes in the CroV genome is very unusual . Photolyases are classified into three major groups : cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer ( CPD ) photolyases , ( 6 - 4 ) photolyases , and single - stranded DNA photolyases ( [ 172 ] and references therein ) . The CPD photolyases are further subdivided into class I and class II enzymes , the former being more prevalent in bacteria and the latter more frequent in eukaryotes ( Fig . 2 . 13 ) . The gene product of crov115 is a predicted CPD class I photolyase and represents the first viral homologue in this class ( Figs . 2 . 13 , 2 . 14 ) . The second CroV photolyase ( crov149 ) does not belong to any of the established types of photolyases . Instead , it is related to a recently described group of photolyases / cryptochromes that are present in several bacterial phyla and the euryarchaeotes [ 172 ] ( Figs . 2 . 13 , 2 . 15 ) . The only eukaryotic member in this group ( Paramecium tetraurelia ) is also the closest homologue to the CroV and Mimivirus sequences and may have acquired this gene by HGT from a giant virus ( Fig . 2 . 15 ) . Figure 2 . 13 Phylogenetic analysis of the photolyase / chryptochrome family . The unrooted Bayesian Inference tree of photolyases and chryptochromes is based on 73 conserved sites . Sequences are coloured orange for archaea , blue for bacteria , and green for eukaryotes . Nodes are labelled with posterior probabilities and GenBank accession numbers are given for each sequence . The group of bacterial / archaeal photolyase - like proteins belongs to COG3046 ( uncharacterized protein related to deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase ) , whereas all other groups in this tree belong to COG0415 ( deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase ) . Due to the low overall sequence conservation among the different groups , the CPD class I photolyases did not resolve into a monophyletic group in this reconstruction . 42 Figure 2 . 14 Phylogenetic analysis of CPD class I photolyases . The unrooted Bayesian Inference tree is based on 189 conserved sites of CPD class I photolyases related to crov115 . Sequences are coloured orange for archaea , blue for bacteria , and green for eukaryotes . Nodes are labelled with posterior probabilities and GenBank accession numbers are given for each sequence . 43 Figure 2 . 15 Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted DNA photolyase crov149 . The unrooted Bayesian Inference tree is based on a 157 aa alignment of DNA photolyases related to crov149 . Sequences are coloured orange for archaea , blue for bacteria , and green for eukaryotes . Two main groups can be differentiated , group 1 comprising a bacterial and an archaeal clade , and group 2 comprising bacterial and viral sequences . The eukaryotic sequence in group 2 is probably the result of horizontal gene transfer . The Mimivirus photolyase is encoded by two separate CDSs ( R852 / R853 and R855 ) . Nodes are labelled with posterior probabilities and GenBank accession numbers are given for each sequence . 44 2 . 3 . 4 Transcription genes Giant viruses typically encode hundreds of genes , including several that regulate gene expression . Among the predicted transcriptional genes in CroV are eight DNA - dependent RNA polymerase II subunits , at least six transcription factors involved in transcription initiation , elongation and termination , a tri - functional mRNA capping enzyme , a poly ( A ) polymerase , and several helicases . The complex transcriptional machinery encoded by CroV suggests that viral gene transcription does not depend on host enzymes , and likely occurs in the cytoplasm . Interestingly , CroV contains a CDS with high similarity to ELP3 - like histone acetyltransferases ( HATs , COG1243 , E - value 10 - 46 ) , a gene previously not seen in viruses . Phylogenetic analysis indicates that eukaryotic HATs fall into two major groups , one being closer related to bacteria and containing mainly members of the chromalveolates and also some excavates , the other being closer to archaea and spanning various eukaryotic kingdoms ( Fig . 2 . 16 ) . The CroV homologue falls within the chromalveolate - excavate clade and may therefore be the result of a HGT event from a eukaryotic host . In combination with other unidentified viral gene products , the CroV HAT may enable the virus to directly modulate the genome condensation state of the host and thus exert control over its transcriptional activity . Alternatively , this enzyme may be involved in replication and packaging of the virus genome itself . Another unusual characteristic of CroV is the presence of three DNA topoisomerase ( Topo ) genes of types IA , IB , and IIA . Topoisomerases catalyze topological rearrangements of DNA molecules and are involved in DNA replication , recombination , and transcription . TopoIA and TopoIIA are very similar to their counterparts in Mimivirus and HGT events from bacteria ( eventually via a eukaryotic phagotrophic host ) have been proposed for these genes [ 173 ] . CroV TopoIB is the first viral homologue of the eukaryotic subfamily , whereas the TopoIB homologue encoded by Mimivirus falls within the bacterial group ( Fig . 2 . 17 ) and is functionally more similar to the poxvirus enzymes [ 80 ] . Despite apparently different evolutionary trajectories , the presence of three topoisomerase genes in CroV and Mimivirus suggests a crucial role for these enzymes in transcription , replication , or packaging of giant virus genomes . 45 Figure 2 . 16 Phylogenetic analysis of ELP3 - like histone acetyltransferases . Shown is an unrooted Bayesian Inference tree based on a 301 aa alignment of ELP3 - like HAT homologues . Sequences are coloured orange for archaea , blue for bacteria , and green for eukaryotes .

The unrooted Bayesian Inference tree is based on a 66 aa alignment of DNA toposiomerases of type IB . Sequences are coloured orange for archaea , blue for bacteria , green for eukaryotes and purple for poxviruses . Nodes are labelled with posterior probabilities and GenBank accession numbers are given for each sequence . 2 . 3 . 5 DNA replication enzymes Similarly to other members of the NCLDV clade that replicate in the host cytoplasm , CroV encodes several DNA replication enzymes . The B - family DNA - dependent DNA polymerase ( PolB ) is the main processing polymerase and is essential for NCLDV genome replication . These enzymes are highly conserved in all lineages and display a low propensity for HGT , which makes them an excellent target for phylogenetic reconstruction analyses . PolB is 47 therefore the most frequently used marker gene to infer evolutionary relationships among dsDNA viruses [ 99 , 174 ] . The phylogenetic position of CroV PolB is discussed in section 2 . 3 . 13 . In CroV , PolB is accompanied by the polymerase processivity factor PCNA ( proliferating cell nuclear antigen ) and other predicted replication proteins including a VV D5 - type primase - helicase , four replication factor C subunits , a lambda - type exonuclease , at least eight DNA helicases , a DNA polymerase III subunit , and a DNA ligase . Two different types of DNA ligases are found in large DNA viruses , ATP - dependent and NAD - dependent DNA ligases . These two versions are mutually exclusive , i . e . the two types have never been found together within the same genome . The distribution pattern of DNA ligases in NCLDV is somewhat patchy , with ATP - dependent DNA ligases occurring in phycodnaviruses , ASFV , and chordopoxviruses , whereas NAD - dependent DNA ligases are found in mimiviruses , iridoviruses , and entomopoxviruses [ 50 ] . Yutin et al . [ 175 ] suggested that the common NCLDV ancestor encoded an NAD - dependent ligase from a bacteriophage source that was replaced by an ATP - dependent DNA ligase in some viral lineages and other lineages lost their DNA ligase entirely . The DNA ligase in CroV belongs to the NAD - dependent type , which may suggest that the CroV version is directly derived from the NCLDV ancestor . Several phycodnaviruses have methylated bases in their genomes [ 176 ] . The extent to which bases in the CroV genome may be modified is unknown , but the presence of six predicted DNA methyltransferases ( crov015 , crov074 , crov347 , crov396 , crov447 , crov472 ) suggests that DNA methylation also occurs in CroV . Replication of a large DNA molecule and packaging of the genome into a relatively small capsid causes topological problems that the virus has to resolve . In addition to the previously mentioned Topo genes , CroV encodes a predicted Holliday junction resolvase and a transposase - resolvase gene pair ( crov356 , crov357 ) similar to bacterial insertion sequences ( IS elements ) , which might be used to overcome topological constraints . 2 . 3 . 6 Ubiquitin pathway components Ubiquitin ( Ub ) is a 76 - aa polypeptide that is extremely conserved among eukaryotes . Posttranslational modification by addition of Ub moieties can alter the function of a protein or target it for degradation [ 177 ] . This process involves three types of enzymes . First , a Ub - activating enzyme E1 transfers a Ub molecule to a Ub - conjugating enzyme E2 . The E2 enzyme then either ubiquitinates the target protein directly , or passes the Ub further on to a Ub ligase E3 , which in turn ubiquitinates the final substrate . Ub signalling appears to be a general strategy employed by NCLDVs to counter host defences , as multiple Ub - conjugating and Ub - hydrolysing 48 enzymes have been found in these viruses [ 50 ] . Furthermore , it has been shown that orthopoxvirus replication requires a functional Ub - proteasome system [ 178 ] . CroV contains a small arsenal of genes encoding proteins predicted to function in the Ub pathway , including the first viral homologue of an E1 Ub - activating enzyme , as well as six E2 Ub - conjugating enzymes , two deubiquinating enzymes , and one Ub gene . Interestingly , the CroV - encoded Ub is only 75 aa long and is missing the C - terminal glycine residue , which is the residue that is usually conjugated to substrate lysine residues . The specific means of how CroV and other giant viruses use Ub signalling to interact with their hosts remain to be determined . 2 . 3 . 7 Molecular chaperones and redox proteins Protein function is dependent on a correct three - dimensional structure . In vivo folding of nascent polypeptides is therefore often assisted by molecular chaperones such as heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) . CroV was found to encode several proteins that were similar to cellular HSPs and other chaperones . Four CDSs contained domains similar to the HSP40 / DnaJ family ( crov127 , crov170 , crov210 , crov375 ) , two CDSs encoded HSP70 / DnaK homologues ( crov241 , crov403 ) , and three CDSs encoded predicted Lon proteases ( crov036 , crov237 , crov478 ) . Proteins of the HSP70 family have a ubiquitous distribution and have been used to reconstruct large - scale phylogenies [ 179 ] . Viral HSP70 homologues are rare and occur only in Mimivirus and in the Closteroviridae , a family of large positive - sense single - stranded RNA plant viruses [ 26 , 180 , 181 ] . Besides its traditional role in protein folding , HSP70 serves various other functions ; e . g . in closteroviruses , it is involved in cell - to - cell virion movement [ 180 ] . HSP70 has also been shown to suppress apoptosis by inhibiting the recruitment of caspases to the apoptosome [ 182 ] , a pathway that might be useful for viruses to exploit in order to prevent premature apoptotic cell death . The function of HSPs encoded by giant viruses is unknown ; they could be involved in the folding of other viral proteins or in virion assembly , the latter condition has been experimentally proven for the closterovirus Citrus tristeza virus [ 183 ] . Phylogenetic analysis of HSP70 / DnaK proteins from all three domains of life showed that CroV and Mimivirus encode two distinct versions of HSP70s ( Fig . 2 . 18 ) . The HSP70 homologue encoded by crov403 was most closely related to the L393 protein of Mimivirus and these two viral sequences grouped unambiguously with the eukaryotic HSP70 proteins , suggesting that the common ancestor of CroV and Mimivirus acquired this gene from a eukaryotic host by HGT . The crov241 - encoded HSP70 homologue , on the other hand , was only distantly related to cellular HSP70s and was more similar to the closteroviral proteins . The second Mimivirus HSP70 homologue , L254 , also fell in the closterovirus cluster , although it branched even deeper than crov241 . Interestingly , some Entamoeba HSP70s were located on this branch , too . 49 Figure 2 . 18 Phylogenetic analysis of HSP70 proteins . The Bayesian Inference tree is based on a 250 aa alignment of conserved regions of HSP70 / DnaK proteins . As eukaryotes encode multiple HSP70 versions that are located in specific cell compartments , organellar homologues were not included in order to simplify the tree . Sequences are coloured orange for archaea , blue for bacteria , green for eukaryotes , black for closteroviruses , and red for giant viruses . Selected nodes are labelled with posterior probabilities and ML bootstrap values ( 500 replicates ) , all nodes with posterior probabilities of 0 . 90 of higher are marked with dots . GenBank accession numbers are given . 50 The closteroviral HSP70 genes may have found their way into the viral ssRNA genome by recombination with host plant mRNA [ 184 ] , but their relationship to protist - infecting viruses with large dsDNA genomes remains enigmatic . It cannot be excluded that the observed clustering of obviously divergent HSP70 homologues may be the result of long - branch attraction , an artefact of phylogenetic analysis [ 185 ] . In order to allow molecular chaperones such as HSP70 to identifiy their substrates , co - chaperones are often required to mediate specific interactions with substrate proteins . The tetratrico peptide repeat ( TPR ) domain has been shown to act as a protein - protein interaction module , e . g . as a co - chaperone of HSP70 and HSP90 [ 186 ] . TPR domains are found in a variety of proteins that are usually part of multi - protein complexes and are involved in diverse cellular processes [ 187 ] . CroV encodes at least six TPR - containing proteins , which may indicate the importance of multi - protein complexes for CroV infection . The ATP - dependent Lon proteases are part of the heat shock response in bacteria and are involved in a variety of cellular processes , but their main function is assumed to be the degradation of misfolded or oxidized proteins by recognizing hydrophobic regions of polypeptides , as they frequently occur in abnormal proteins [ 188 ] . The Lon proteases consist of an N - terminal domain of variable length responsible for substrate specificity , a central ATPase domain , and a C - terminal proteolytic domain . In eukaryotes , Lon is localized in the mitochondrial matrix where it degrades oxidatively modified proteins [ 189 ] . The first viral homologue of a Lon protease was found in Mimivirus [ 26 ] and CroV encodes three of these enzymes . Phylogenetic analysis showed that CroV and Mimivirus Lon proteases were closely related to each other and formed a distinct clade which also included Lon homologues from the mitochondrion of Hydra magnipapillata and the chlamydia bacterium Waddlia chondrophila ( Fig . 2 . 19 ) . Some proteins require intra - or intermolecular disulfide bonds for structural integrity or enzymatic activity . The correct formation of these S - S bonds by oxidative protein folding is catalyzed by a family of molecular chaperones called protein disulfide isomerases ( PDIs ) . PDIs can form , dissolve , and isomerize disulfide bonds , and are also able to bind to partially unfolded polypeptides [ 190 , 191 ] . The two predicted PDIs and other redox proteins encoded by CroV are discussed in more detail in section 3 . 3 . 5 . 51 Figure 2 . 19 Phylogenetic analysis of ATP - dependent Lon proteases . The Bayesian Inference tree is based on a 354 aa alignment of conserved regions of Lon proteases . Lon homologues from Hydra magnipapillata , Bruglia malayi , and Saccoglossus kowalevskii are encoded by mitochondrial DNA . Sequences are coloured orange for archaea , blue for bacteria , green for eukaryotes , and red for viruses . Selected nodes are labelled with posterior probabilities and GenBank accession numbers are given for each sequence . 52 2 . 3 . 8 Inteins No introns were detected in the genome , but four CroV CDSs contain an intein element . Inteins are self - splicing protein sequences inserted in the coding region of another protein , the host protein or " extein " [ 192 ] . Inteins have been termed parasitic genetic elements , because they are of no apparent benefit to their host . The intein element is transcribed and translated together with the host protein . It then removes itself from the host protein through autocatalytic splicing , covalently joining the N - terminal extein part with the C - terminal extein part to yield a functional full - length host protein . As of November 4 , 2010 , the New England Biolabs Intein Registry 10 All four CroV inteins are located in NCLDV core genes that are thought to play a key role in DNA replication and transcription ( Fig . 2 . 20 ) : PolB , TopoIIA , DNA - dependent RNA polymerase II subunit 2 ( RPB2 ) , and the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase ( RNR ) . With the exception of the RPB2 mini intein , all CroV inteins contain an HE domain and are thus considered large inteins . However , the HE motifs in PolB and RNR are hardly recognizable and may indicate that these HE domains are degenerating . The specific properties of the four inteins are listed in Table 2 . 4 . Ten other inteins have been found in viruses infecting eukaryotes [ 193 ] , including RNR inteins in four iridoviruses and Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus ( PBCV ) NY - 2A [ 38 ] . PolB inteins inserted in the YGD / TDS catalytic site are present in several giant viruses , such as Mimivirus [ 196 ] , Heterosigma akashiwo virus [ 197 ] , and Chrysochromulina ericina virus [ 198 ] . A PCR - based study of phycodnaviral PolB sequences in Hawaiian coastal waters suggests that inteins may be very common in large marine DNA viruses [ 199 ] . With the exception of a gene fragment from Emiliania huxleyi virus 163 [ 200 ] , the CroV RPB2 intein constitutes the only viral report of an intein in RPB2 and represents a new insertion site in this gene . Finally , the CroV TopoIIA intein is the first case of an intein in a DNA topoisomerase II listed 581 inteins from at least 250 different species [ 193 ] . Curiously , inteins are preferentially found in proteins associated with DNA replication and repair [ 194 ] . The insertion site in the host protein is highly conserved , such as the YGD / TDS catalytic motif in DNA polymerases . The assignment of inteins into allele groups is based on the observation that inteins sharing the same insertion site in orthologous host proteins are more similar to each other than to inteins found at different insertion sites in the same host protein ; the former ones are thus termed intein alleles [ 195 ] . Inteins come in two flavours , large and mini [ 194 ] . Large inteins are equipped with a homing endonuclease ( HE ) domain , which enables the intein to invade empty target sites in other genes , species , or populations via horizontal transmission . Mini inteins , on the other hand , have lost their endonuclease domain and are therefore trapped in their current location . 10 http : / / www . neb . com / neb / inteins . html 53 gene , thus extending the known range of intein - containing genes . As indicated in Fig . 2 . 20 , all four CroV inteins possess the conserved nucleophilic residues that are required for the standard splicing reaction ( C / S at the N - terminal splice junction and N [ C / S / T ] at the C - terminal splice junction ) [ 192 ] . It can therefore be hypothesized that the CroV inteins are capable of autocatalytic excision ( for further discussion of the Rpb2 intein see section 3 . 3 . 3 ) . Whereas the protein - splicing mechanism of inteins is well characterized and is broadly applied in biotechnology [ 201 ] , the biological role and evolutionary origin of these genetic elements are not well understood . Although large inteins carry an HE domain and are potentially mobile , horizontal transmission of inteins is considered a rare event , as closely related species of an intein - containing species are often intein - free [ 202 ] . Inteins occur in all three domains of life and are extremely divergent ; they are thus thought to be very ancient , probably dating back to the last universal common ancestor ( LUCA ) of eukaryotes , bacteria , and archaea [ 203 ] . Nagasaki et al . suggested that large dsDNA viruses might be a reservoir for inteins and could facilitate their horizontal transmission between different hosts [ 197 ] . The discovery of four inteins in CroV is in concordance with this idea . Figure 2 . 20 Location of CroV inteins in their host proteins . The linear peptide chains of the four intein - containing genes are drawn to scale . Regions shaded blue correspond to exteins ( host protein sequences ) , the red intervening blocks depict the inteins . Letters within the proteins designate amino acids ( single - letter code ) that flank the splice sites . Residues printed in bold are predicted to be essential for the self - splicing mechanism . 54 Table 2 . 4 Properties of the four CroV inteins . The following categories represent a subset of the information collected on InBase , the NEB intein registry . ' DOD ' is a member of the " LAGLIDADG " or dodecapeptide motif family of homing endonucleases . ' Prototype allele ' lists the first intein identified at the identical extein insertion site in an extein homolog . ' Insert site ' gives the name of the conserved extein site in which the intein is inserted .

The most prevalent repetitive element is a 66 bp long repeat similar to the FNIP / IP22 repeat ( Pfam entry PF05725 ) , a member of the leucine - rich repeat ( LRR ) family . In total , there are more than 400 copies of this repeat in the CroV genome , and they are present in at least 28 CDSs ( Fig . 2 . 5 and Table B . 1 in Appendix B ) . Although the IP22 motif is degenerate , its widespread occurrence in the genome posed a major obstacle during contig assembly and gap - closing ( see section 2 . 2 . 3 and Appendix A ) . IP22 is named after the first two conserved amino acids of this 22 - amino acid - long motif [ 204 ] . A consensus sequence logo created from 258 IP22 units is shown in Fig . 2 . 22A . The CroV genome was found to contain two major and several minor versions of IP22 repeats ; the predominant version 1 has a conserved tryptophane ( W ) at the beginning of the motif , whereas the less abundant version 2 starts with a leucine ( L ) ( Fig . 2 . 22C ) . Both versions contain a highly conserved proline ( P ) at the second position . In accordance with the naming of IP22 , I termed the CroV versions WP22 and LP22 , respectively . Additional differences between WP22 and LP22 are found at position 7 ( WP22 : threonine , LP22 : histidine ) , position 17 ( WP22 : proline , LP22 : lysine ) , and in a single aa insertion at position 19 of the LP22 version ( Fig . 2 . 22C ) . The distribution of these two versions in the genome was found to be non - random ; the majority ( > 70 % ) of LP22 repeats is located within the first 32 kbp of the CroV genome , from which the WP22 repeat is completely absent ( Fig . 2 . 21 ) . In contrast , the WP22 repeat dominates the rest of the genome . Furthermore , the orientation of these repeats exhibits a clear pattern : all WP22 / LP22 repeats located before position 470 , 000 are encoded by the reverse strand , whereas all WP22 / LP22 repeats located after position 490 , 000 are encoded by the forward strand ( Fig . 2 . 21 ) . The biological reason for the observed distal orientation of the WP22 / LP22 repeats is not known , but it is possible that they might be involved in replication or packaging of the viral genome . The IP22 repeat has been found in eight Mimivirus genes and more than 200 Dictyostelium discoideum genes [ 204 ] , and is also present in the related dictyostelid Polysphondylium pallidum as well as in the phaeophyte Ectocarpus siliculosus [ 205 ] . Whereas LRRs are known to mediate protein - protein interactions in a variety of proteins with diverse functions [ 206 ] and IP22 repeats have been proposed to be involved in calmodulin binding and cell motility [ 204 , 207 ] , the specific role of these repeats in CroV is unknown . 56 Figure 2 . 21 Dot plot analysis of the CroV genome to show repeated sequences . The linear CroV genome is plotted on both axes and matching sequences are marked by a dot at their cross position . The diagonal line represents the perfect match of the genome against itself . Any other structures are the result of repeated sequences in the genome . When the repeat sequence is in the same orientation as the source sequence , it is coloured in black ; inverted repeats are coloured in red . Blue and green arrows below the dot plot indicate the orientation of LP22 and WP22 repeats , respectively . Numbers on axes refer to CroV genome positions . 57 Figure 2 . 22 Sequence logos of FNIP / IP22 repeats in CroV . ( A ) DNA and protein consensus sequence of 258 FNIP / IP22 repeats ( all versions ) . ( B ) DNA logos created from alignments of 181 copies of the WP22 version , and 42 copies of the LP22 version , respectively . ( C ) Protein logos of the DNA logos from ( B ) . All sequence logos were created using WebLogo 11 [ 154 ] . Despite considerable degeneracy of the WP22 motif ( Fig . 2 . 22 , amino acids 12 and 13 ) , some residues are highly conserved at the protein level . For instance , proline is encoded by the triplet " CCN " ( " N " being any nucleotide ) and the conserved proline at position 2 of the WP22 repeat is encoded by highly conserved cytidines at the first two codon positions , but the third codon position is not conserved , as this has no influence on aa specificity ( Fig . 2 . 22B , C ) . An even more striking example is the serine at position 4 , which is encoded by the triplet " TCA " in the WP22 version , but by the unrelated " AGT " codon in the LP22 version ( Fig . 2 . 22B , boxed residues ) . Furthermore , most of the WP22 / LP22 repeats are found in - frame within a CDS . This suggests that these repeats are functionally conserved at the protein level . 11 http : / / weblogo . berkeley . edu / logo . cgi 58 The WP22 / LP22 - containing proteins are likely to be the result of lineage - specific gene family expansion , where duplicated genes can acquire new functions [ 50 ] . Other forms of DNA repeats in the CroV genome are locally restricted and significantly less abundant than the WP22 / LP22 repeat ( Fig . 2 . 21 ) . A 48 bp - long tandem repeat found in CDSs crov191 and crov193 translates into a 16 aa - long highly charged peptide with the consensus sequence " EKTKQEVEKTKQIEFI " . Further repetitive elements include ankryin repeats ( e . g . in crov429 , crov430 , crov440 ) , GC - rich repeats in crov305 and crov306 , and TPR domains in various CDSs such as crov467 - 471 ( Fig . 2 . 21 ) . Ankyrin repeats mediate protein - protein interactions and are found in almost all NCLDV genomes [ 50 ] ; in Mimivirus , the 66 ankyrin - containing genes represent the largest paralogous family [ 56 ] . The helical TPR motif is composed of 34 loosely conserved amino acids and TPR domains are found in a variety of cellular proteins , where they mediate specific protein interactions [ 187 ] ( see section 2 . 3 . 7 ) . 2 . 3 . 10 Microarray analysis A microarray experiment was undertaken to determine which CroV genes were unambiguously transcribed in infected cells and if there was a clear temporal pattern in the transcription of those genes . Viral transcripts were detected in infected C . roenbergensis cells by fluorescently labelling mRNA isolated at different time points during the infection cycle , which lasts 12 - 18 hours in C . roenbergensis strain E4 - 10 . Labelled transcripts were then hybridized to glass slides spotted with oligonucleotide probes for 438 of the 544 predicted CroV genes , because the microarray was designed prior to completion of the genome sequence . A total of 274 genes ( 63 % ) had detectable levels of expression , 152 genes ( 35 % ) were below the detection limit ; 4 ( 1 % ) cross - hybridized with host mRNA isolated from uninfected cells , and 8 ( 2 % ) could not be assigned a clear on / off status ( Fig . 2 . 5 , Table B . 1 ) . About half of the predicted genes and 63 % of the genes tested were expressed during infection . This percentage is comparable to the observed expression of 65 % of viral genes during infection of the marine phytoplankter Emiliania huxleyi by EhV - 86 [ 10 ] . However , recent gene expression studies in PBCV - 1 and Mimivirus validated transcription for nearly all of their predicted genes [ 69 , 208 ] . It seems therefore likely that the microarray data underestimates the true extent of transcriptional activity in CroV ( see section 3 . 3 . 6 for further discussion and comparison with proteome data ) . All of the previously mentioned translation - related genes in CroV , as well as most of the " virus - atypical " genes were found to be expressed ( Table B . 1 ) , suggesting that these genes are functional . Although the microarray experiment was designed primarily to validate CroV gene predictions and cannot be exploited quantitatively , the data allowed recognizing some general trends of 59 Figure 2 . 23 Temporal CroV gene expression profile during infection . The x - axis shows the time points post infection at which RNA was extracted from infected cultures for microarray analysis ( 0 - 72 h p . i . ) and two additional time points at which flagellate concentrations of infected ( red curve ) and uninfected ( yellow curve ) cultures were determined ( 100 h p . i . , 400 h p . i . ) . Blue columns indicate the total number of CroV genes that were found to be transcribed at a given time point ; red columns indicate the number of new transcripts , i . e . transcribed genes for which no transcripts had been found at previous time points . It should be noted that although most genes stayed " on " for the rest of the experiment once their mRNA had been detected , this was not the case for all genes ; hence , the sum of red columns leading up to a certain time point is not equivalent to the value of the blue column at that time point . CroV gene expression . Fig . 2 . 23 shows the temporal transcription profile of CroV infection . Immediately after infection , transcripts of 62 viral genes were detected . It is possible that some of these very early transcripts are already packaged in the virion , as similar findings have been reported from Mimivirus [ 26 ] . The number of newly transcribed genes decreased from 0 h p . i . to 1 h p . i . , then increased slightly at 2 h p . i . . At 2 h p . i . and 3 h p . i . , most of the transcription and replication enzymes were found to be expressed ( Table B . 1 ) , suggesting that viral genome replication was initiated around 3 h p . i . . At 6 h p . i . , there was a significant increase in transcriptional activity and capsid and core genes were then seen expressed for the first time . This suggests that the synthesis of capsid structures started as early as 3 - 6 h p . i . . From 12 h p . i . to 72 h p . i . , only 21 genes were transcribed that had not been detected at earlier time points . 60 This is in agreement with electron microscopy observations of ultra thin - sectioned cells , suggesting that the CroV infection cycle lasts 12 - 18 hours ( see chapter 4 ) . The finding that infected cultures in the microarray experiment did not decline before 72 h p . i . can be explained by the mixed infection profile of this experiment . A relatively low MOI had to be used for inoculation in order to avoid instant cell lysis accompanied by a lack of CroV production , an effect that was observed at higher MOIs and may be similar to a mechanism known as " lysis from without " in other virus - host systems [ 209 , 210 ] . Therefore , not all host cells were immediately infected at 0 h p . i . . Based on the time points at which transcripts were first detected , it was possible to distinguish between an early and a late stage of CroV gene expression . The early stage lasts from 0 h p . i . to 3 h p . i . and comprises 150 genes ( Fig . 2 . 23 , Table B . 1 ) . The majority of DNA replication and transcription genes belong to the early class . The late stage is characterized by genes that were first detected in the microarray at 6 h p . i . or later . The 124 genes in this class include all of the predicted structural components , such as the major and minor capsid proteins . Further and more extensive analysis of the CroV transcriptome may be able to refine this preliminary temporal classification , e . g . by subdividing the early stage into immediate early ( 0 - 1 h p . i . ) and late early ( 2 - 3 h p . i . ) stages , as hinted at by the temporal expression profile in Fig . 2 . 23 . 2 . 3 . 11 Promoter analysis The intergenic regions have an average size of 71 bp with a standard deviation of 64 bp . I examined the 100 nt region upstream of the predicted start codons for possible promoter motifs using MEME software [ 153 ] . A perfectly conserved " AAAAATTGA " motif , flanked by AT - rich sequences , was found to precede 127 CroV CDSs ( 23 % ) ( Fig . 2 . 24A ) . The MEME E - value for this motif is 10 - 170 . Allowing one mismatch per sequence at the less strongly conserved positions one to six of the AAAAATTGA motif increases the number of positive CDSs to 191 ( 35 % ) . The majority of CDSs that display this motif in their immediate upstream region belong to the " early " temporal category ( pie chart in Fig . 2 . 24A ) . I therefore classified this motif as an early gene promoter in CroV . These results are in agreement with findings from Mimivirus , where a nearly identical motif ( AAAATTGA ) is present in the promoter region of 45 % of Mimivirus genes , acting as an early promoter element [ 69 , 70 ] . In contrast to Mimivirus , however , where the motif is found preferentially in the - 50 to - 110 region , the early promoter motif in CroV displays a much narrower distribution , with a peak at position - 40 relative to the predicted start codon ( Fig . 2 . 24B ) . The search for a possible late promoter motif was initiated with a representative set of six CDSs , all predicted to encode capsid components ( see section 2 . 2 . 4 ) . Five of these six genes exhibit the conserved tetramer " TCTA " , flanked by AT - rich regions on either side , 61 Figure 2 . 24 Early and late gene promoter motifs in CroV . ( A ) Sequence logos depicting the consensus sequence for putative early ( AAAAATTGA ) and late ( TCTA ) promoter motifs . Pie charts show gene expression data for those CDSs that contained the respective motifs within their immediate 5’ upstream regions . The majority of CDSs associated with the AAAAATTGA motif were first seen expressed at 0 - 3 h p . i . , whereas transcripts for most of the TCTA - associated CDSs were not detected until 6 h p . i . or later . ( B ) Positional distribution of the two motifs relative to the predicted start codon . A narrow distribution with a peak around position - 40 is observed for the AAAAATTGA motif ( n = 191 ) . The TCTA motif ( n = 72 ) occurs preferentially at position - 13 to - 21 . The search for this motif was restricted to the upstream 30 nt region . Figure 2 . 25 MEME sequence logo of the late promoter motif . 62 in their - 11 to - 20 region ( Fig . 2 . 24 ) . Based on this profile , I expanded the search to all CroV CDSs and found 72 CDSs to be positive for the TCTA motif signature . A MEME search on the 30 nt upstream region of the 124 genes classified as " late " yielded a very similar motif ( MEME E - value 5x10 - 4 , Fig . 2 . 25 ) . As shown in Fig . 2 . 24A , most CDSs with the TCTA promoter motif were first found to be expressed at 6 h p . i . or later , supporting the conclusion that this sequence motif represents a promoter element for genes transcribed during the late stage of CroV infection . The CroV late promoter motif is unrelated to the putative late promoter motif identified in Mimivirus [ 69 ] . 2 . 3 . 12 A 38 kbp genomic fragment involved in carbohydrate metabolism Upon examination of the CroV promoter distribution , I noticed that neither early nor late promoter motifs were associated with CDSs located between the genomic positions 264 , 800 and 302 , 500 ( Fig . 2 . 5 ) . Of these 34 CDSs ( crov242 - crov275 ) , 14 are most similar to bacterial proteins ( Table 2 . 5 , BLASTP E - value < 10 - 5 ) and seven of them are predicted to function in carbohydrate metabolism ( Table B . 1 ) . Among them are enzymes for the biosynthesis of 3 - deoxy - D - manno - octulosonate ( KDO ) ( Fig . 2 . 26 ) . In Gram - negative bacteria , KDO is an essential component of the lipopolysaccharide layer , linking lipid A to polysaccharides [ 211 ] . KDO is also found in the green alga Chlorella and in the cell wall of higher plants ( [ 212 ] and references therein ) . Biosynthesis of KDO involves the three enzymes arabinose - 5 - phosphate isomerase ( API ) , KDO 8 - phosphate synthase ( KDOPS ) , and KDO 8 - phosphate phosphatase ( KDOPase ) . A cytidylyltransferase ( CMP - KDO synthetase , CKS ) is then required to activate KDO for downstream reactions ( Fig . 2 . 26A ) . Using conserved motif searches and multiple sequence alignments , crov265 was found to encode a predicted bifunctional KDOPase / API , and the N - terminal domain of crov267 contains a KDOPS homologue . The C - terminal domain of crov267 is a predicted dTDP - 6 - deoxy - L - hexose 3 - O - methyltransferase , and crov266 encodes a predicted bifunctional N - acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase ( CMP - NeuAcS ) / demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase ( Figs . 2 . 26B , 2 . 27 - 2 . 30 ) . Whether the cytidylyltransferase in crov266 is a functional CMP - NeuAcS and accordingly involved in sialic acid activation , as suggested by phylogenetic analysis ( Fig . 2 . 30 ) , or rather a structurally related KDO - activating CKS , remains to be tested . The remaining CroV CDSs with functional annotation in this region are predicted glycosyl transferases and other sugar - modifying enzymes ( Table B . 1 ) . The presence of these genes implies a role in viral glycoprotein biosynthesis and suggests that the virion surface is coated with KDO - or sialic acid - like glycoconjugates , which could be involved in virion - cell recognition . Given that the CDSs in this 63 region lack the early / late promoter signals and display no similarity to Mimivirus genes , the 38 kbp region must have been acquired after the CroV lineage split from the Mimivirus lineage . Because many of the CDSs in this region were most similar to bacterial genes ( Table 2 . 5 , Figs . 2 . 27 , 2 . 28 ) , it is tempting to speculate that they may have been acquired from a bacterium , given that CroV frequently encounters phagocytosed bacteria inside the host cytoplasm . Genomic islands of putative bacterial origin have been identified in other giant viruses such as phycodnaviruses and Mimivirus , but in contrast to CroV , these bacterial gene clusters tend to be located towards the ends of the linear viral chromosomes [ 213 ] . However , given that the GC content of the 38 kbp region is even lower than that of the rest of the CroV genome ( 19 . 4 % vs . 23 . 6 % G + C ) , and that some of these proteins occupy a phylogenetic position between bacterial and eukaryotic homologues ( e . g . KDOPS and KDOPase , Figs . 2 . 28 , 2 . 29 ) , alternative scenarios for the origin of this region cannot be ruled out .

Nodes are labelled with support values and GenBank accession numbers are given for each sequence . 70 2 . 3 . 13 Phylogenetic relationship to other viruses Based on the presence and phylogenetic analysis of a set of core genes ( Fig . 2 . 31 ) , CroV is a new addition to the presumably monophyletic group of NCLDVs [ 26 , 49 , 50 ] , which includes the families Ascoviridae , Asfarviridae , Iridoviridae , Mimiviridae , Phycodnaviridae , Poxviridae , and the newly discovered Marseillevirus [ 39 ] . In a recent study by Yutin and coworkers , genes encoded by NCLDVs were categorized into groups that presumably evolved from a common ancestor and subsequently diversified in the various NCLDV families [ 51 ] . Using this dataset of NucleoCytoplasmic Virus Orthologous Genes ( NCVOGs ) , at least 172 CroV CDSs belong to an existing NCVOG ( Table B . 1 ) . Thirty - two percent of CroV CDSs are significantly similar to a Mimivirus gene ( any Mimivirus hit with a BLASTP E - value < 10 - 5 ) and 22 CroV CDSs have their only detectable GenBank homologue in Mimivirus ( as of September 2010 ) . CroV therefore represents the closest known relative to Mimivirus , despite large differences in genome ( 730 kbp vs . 1 , 181 kbp ) and capsid size ( 280 nm vs . 500 nm ) . The CroV - Mimivirus relationship is further corroborated by phylogenetic analysis of the DNA polymerase PolB , a commonly used marker gene to infer phylogenetic relationships among NCLDVs . Bayesian Inference analysis of conserved regions of PolB resulted in a strongly supported clade comprising the largest known viruses : Mimivirus , CroV , and three partially sequenced viruses infecting the marine microalgae Phaeocystis pouchetii ( PpV ) , Chrysochromulina ericina ( CeV ) , and Pyramimonas orientalis ( PoV ) ( Fig . 2 . 32 ) . These three algal viruses , for which only PolB and major capsid protein ( MCP ) sequences were available , also possess very large DNA genomes ( 485 kbp , 510 kbp , and 560 kbp , respectively ) and are proposed members of the family Phycodnaviridae , although a taxonomic revision of this tentative assignment has been suggested [ 98 ] . Similarly , when the MCP is used to reconstruct the NCLDV phylogeny ( Fig . 2 . 33 ) , these five viruses form a monophyletic group that also includes Heterosigma akashiwo virus , another giant virus that is assigned to the Phycodnaviridae . The topology of the NCLDV tree strongly suggests that the five largest viral genomes are more closely related to each other than to other NCLDV families , and that they may have originated from a relatively recent ancestral virus that must have already been a bona fide NCLDV with a large genome , probably encoding more than 150 proteins . 71 Figure 2 . 31 NCLDV core genes found in CroV .

With a genome size larger than that of some cellular organisms , CroV is an example of an extraordinarily complex virus . It possesses a large number of predicted genes involved in DNA replication , transcription , translation , protein modification , and carbohydrate metabolism , indicating that CroV has a highly autonomous propagation strategy during infection . The mechanisms by which such enormous virus genomes evolved have been much discussed [ 56 , 213 , 214 ] . Most studies have focused on Mimivirus , since it represents the most extreme case of a giant virus and is the largest dataset available . The majority of Mimivirus genes have no cellular homologues and are presumably very ancient [ 165 ] , up to one third of its genes arose through gene and genome duplication [ 56 ] , and less than 15 % of Mimivirus genes may have been horizontally transferred from eukaryotes and bacteria [ 84 ] . This general picture of giant virus genome evolution seems to be confirmed by my initial analysis of the CroV genome . Gene duplication and lineage - specific expansion of the FNIP - like repeat are two factors that clearly contributed to the enormous size of the CroV genome . Examples of duplicated genes are the paralogous groups of CDSs crov027 - 031 ( contain LP22 repeats ) , crov420 - 422 ( unknown function ) , and some of the tRNA genes . A potential case of large - scale HGT from a bacterium is represented by the 38 kbp genomic segment that differs in coding content and promoter regions from the rest of the viral genome ( see section 2 . 3 . 12 ) . The remaining CDSs with cellular homologues are more difficult to categorize , since genes can be transferred from cells to viruses and vice versa . However , the majority of CroV CDSs show no significant similarity to any sequences in the public databases and their evolutionary origin remains hidden . The array of " organismal " genes found in CroV continues to close the overlap in metabolic coding capacity between large viruses and cellular life forms . This continued blurring of the distinction between what is considered living and non - living adds to the ongoing debate about the puzzling evolutionary history of giant viruses [ 48 , 130 , 214 ] . 75 3 The Virion Proteome of CroV 3 . 1 Synopsis The virion is the physical entity of a virus that protects the genetic material and delivers it to a suitable host cell . As such , the proteins present in the virion can give important clues about the extracellular , penetration , and early intracellular stages of the virus replication cycle . In this chapter , the protein composition of the giant Cafeteria roenbergensis virus ( CroV ) particle is assessed . Liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS ) was performed on purified CroV virions and resulted in the identification of 129 virus - encoded proteins . In addition to structural components , CroV packages many non - structural proteins , including 17 transcription proteins , 6 DNA repair enzymes , 5 redox - active proteins , and 4 proteases . Seventy - eight proteins identified in this study had no known function . A comparison of CroV and Mimivirus revealed that 34 proteins are present in both virions . The finding that giant viruses infecting hosts of different eukaryotic supergroups share a conserved set of virion proteins suggests that the last common ancestor of these viruses must have already possessed a similarly complex particle composition . These results also imply that the early events of CroV infection may resemble those of Mimivirus and the poxviruses , where viral transcription starts in the host cytoplasm while the viral genome is still enclosed in the virion core . 3 . 2 Materials and methods 3 . 2 . 1 Virus purification The culturing conditions of Cafeteria roenbergensis strain E4 - 10 have been described in section 2 . 2 . 1 . Exponentially growing cultures were infected with CroV , and cell concentrations were monitored by staining with Lugol’s Acid Iodine and counting by microscopy using a hemocytometer . CroV virions were purified from ~ 10 l of culture lysate by centrifugation for 1 h at 10 , 500 x g in a Sorvall RC - 5C centrifuge ( GSA rotor , 4°C ) to pellet bacteria and cell debris . CroV was concentrated from the supernatant by tangential flow filtration ( TFF ) using a Vivaflow 200 , 0 . 2 µm PES unit ( Sartorius Mechatronics , Canada ) to a final volume of ~ 30 ml . Fourteen millilitres of concentrate was poured into Ultra - clear TM ultracentrifuge tubes ( Beckman , Canada ) , then 0 . 4 ml of 50 % ( w / v ) Optiprep TM solution ( Sigma , Canada ) was carefully pipetted to the bottom of the tubes , and the tubes were centrifuged for 1 h in a Sorvall RC80 ultracentrifuge ( SW40 rotor , 20°C ) . A centrifugal force of 150 , 000 x g was necessary to concentrate CroV in the high buoyancy sea water medium . The concentrated layer of virus and contaminating 76 bacteria on top of the Optiprep TM cushion was removed by pipetting and dialyzed overnight in a 20 , 000 MWCO dialysis cassette ( 3 ml Slide - A - Lyzer , Pierce , U . S . A . ) against 1 l of 200 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 4°C , and then for several hours against 1 l of 50 mMTris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 4°C . The dialyzed suspension was loaded in thin - walled 14 ml Ultra - clear TM ultracentrifuge tubes ( Beckman , Canada ) on top of a 12 ml 15 / 25 / 35 % ( w / v ) Optiprep TM gradient ( in 50 mMTris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 ) , which had been linearized at room temperature overnight . The gradient was centrifuged for 1 . 5 h at 110 , 000 x g ( SW40 rotor , 20°C ) , after which the CroV - containing fraction was extracted by puncturing the side of the tube with a 23 G needle and diluted threefold with 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 . The purified virions were concentrated further by centrifugation for 1 h at 20 , 000 x g , 20°C , in 1 . 5 ml microfuge tubes in an Eppendorf 5810 tabletop centrifuge and the pellets were resuspended in a final volume of 20 µl . 3 . 2 . 2 Protein sample fractionation and tryptic digestion 12 The 20 µl sample containing ~ 3x10 10 viruses was mixed with 2 . 5x10 - 3 U / µl benzonase nuclease ( Novagen , Germany ) and 1 % SDS for 1 h at room temperature . Proteins were resolved on a 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel which was stained with blue - silver colloidal Coomassie [ 215 ] . The gel lane was cut into 10 bands followed by in - gel reduction ( 10 mM dithiothreitol for 45 min at 56°C ) , alkylation ( 55 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at 37°C ) and trypsinization ( 12 . 5 ng / µl of trypsin overnight at 37°C ) . 3 . 2 . 3 Liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry The samples were desalted with a STop - And - Go Extraction ( STAGE ) tip [ 216 ] and analyzed by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry using a linear trapping quadrupole - Orbitrap ( LTQ - OrbitrapXL , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Germany ) . This was coupled on - line to a 1100 Series nanoflow high performance liquid chromatography system ( HPLC ; Agilent Technologies ) that uses a nanospray ionization source ( Proxeon , Denmark ) and a holding column packed in - house with ReproSil - Pur C18 - AQ , 3 µm , 120 A ( Dr . Maisch GmBH ) into 20 cm long and 50 µm inner diameter [ 217 ] . A trap column containing AQUA C18 , 5 µm , 200 A ( Phenomenex ) was also used . Buffer A ( 0 . 5 % acetic acid ) and buffer B ( 0 . 5 % acetic acid , 80 % acetonitrile ) were run in gradients of 10 % B to 32 % B over 57 min , 32 % B to 40 % B over 5 min , 40 % B to 100 % B over 2 min , 100 % B for 2 min , and finally 0 % B for another 10 min to recondition the column [ 217 ] . The LTQ - Orbitrap was set to acquire a full - range scan at 60 , 000 resolution from 350 to 12 Protein sample fractionation , digestion , and LC - MS / MS analysis have been conducted by Dr . I . Kelly in the laboratory of Dr . L . Foster , University of British Columbia . 77 1500 Th in the Orbitrap and to simultaneously fragment the top five peptide ions in each cycle in the LTQ . In addition , peptides were analyzed on a Q - TOF ( quadrupol - time of flight ) mass spectrometer ( Accurate Mass 6520 Q - TOF , Agilent ) , which was on - line coupled to an Agilent 1200 Series nanoflow HPLC using a Chip Qube electrospray ionization Interface ( Agilent ) . The Agilent HPLC consisted of a 1200 Series binary capillary pump with a vacuum degasser for sample loading and a nano - pump with a vacuum degasser , autosampler and thermostat for gradient separation . A high capacity HPLC chip with 160 nl enrichment column and a 0 . 075 mm x 150 mm analytical column containing Zorbax 300SBC - 18 5 μm stationary phase ( Agilent ) was used in the Chip Qube . The thermostat temperature was set at 6°C . The autosampler was set for a draw speed of 5 μ l / min and an ejection speed of 40 μ l / min . Each sample was automatically loaded on the enrichment column at flow rate 4 μ l / min of buffer A ( 0 . 1 % formic acid , 3 % acetonitrile ) and at 4 μ l injection flush volume . Gradients of 110 . 2 min were run with the nano - pump at 0 . 3 μ l / min from 0 % buffer B ( 0 . 1 % formic acid , 90 % acetonitrile ) to 5 % B over 2 min , 5 % B to 35 % B over 78 min , 35 % to 45 % B over 10 min , 45 % to 95 % over 0 . 1 min , 95 % B for 20 min , and finally 95 % to 3 % B over 0 . 1 min to recondition the column for the next analysis . The Chip Qube was set at a degas heater temperature of 325°C and a degas flow rate of 5 l / min . The ion optics were set at the following values : VCap 1860 V , Fragmentor 175 V , Skimmer 1 65 V , Octopole RF Peak 750 V , MS1 Centroid Data Abs Threshold 20 , MS2 Centroid Data Abs Threshold 5 . The Q - TOF was set to acquire a full - range scan on the TOF detector from 300 to 2000 Th at a scan rate of 6 for MS and from 50 to 3200 Th at a scan rate of 3 for MS / MS ( isolation width 4 amu ) . Collision energy was calculated automatically depending on the charge state of the parent ions using a collision energy slope of 3 . 6 and collision energy offset of 2 . 4 . A maximum of 6 parent ions ( absolute precursor threshold 1000 , relative precursor threshold 0 . 01 , charge state 2 + and higher ) were selected for MS / MS after each MS scan and were excluded for 0 . 25 min . The data were processed using Spectrum Mill Rev A . 03 . 03 . 084 SR4 with a parent mass tolerance of 10 ppm , a fragment mass tolerance of 1000 ppm , fixed modification carbamidomethylation , low parent 300 . 0 Th , high parent 6000 Th , maximum sequence tag length 1 , group scans 15 s , parent tolerance 1 . 4 , similarity merging 1 , minimum signal / noise ratio PMF 15 , minimum MS signal / noise 25 . 78 3 . 2 . 4 Data processing Fragment spectra were searched against a custom protein database consisting of 543 predicted CroV protein - coding sequences ( CDSs ) , 1353 CroV unidentified reading frames ( URFs ; these are open reading frames [ ORFs ] that are unlikely to encode proteins because they are shorter than 150 nt or overlap with a larger ORF , see section 2 . 2 . 4 ) , 20 virophage CDSs , 53 virophage URFs , and 229 ORFs from a bacteriophage called phage307 ( see Appendix E ) . The search was conducted using Mascot ( v2 . 2 , Matrix Science ) with the following parameters : trypsin specificity allowing up to one missed cleavage ; pI range 3 . 0 - 10 . 0 ; cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification ; methionine oxidation and deamidation of asparagine and glutamine as variable modifications ; ESI - trap fragmentation characteristics ; 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ion masses ; 0 . 8 Da tolerance for fragment ion masses . Proteins were considered identified when at least two unique peptides of eight or more amino acids were found with Mascot Ions Scores > 25 , resulting in an estimated false discovery rate of less than 0 . 5 % based on reversed database searching . The relative abundances of protein components were estimated by dividing the number of peptides identified in MS / MS experiments by the number of expected peptides obtained by in silico trypsination . Transmembrane helices in viral proteins were predicted using the Hidden Markov Model implemented in the TMHMM Server v . 2 . 0 13 [ 218 ] . 13 http : / / www . cbs . dtu . dk / services / TMHMM 79 3 . 3 Results and discussion 3 . 3 . 1 Identification of CroV virion proteins Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and must establish a productive infection in their hosts in order to propagate themselves . The virion composition is a critical factor in this process , as it determines host specificity and mediates penetration and entry of virus particles into the host cell . Virion proteins are easily amenable to proteomic methods if the particles can be obtained in pure form , and several virion proteomes have already been described [ 68 , 219 - 226 ] . CroV virions were purified by Optiprep TM density gradient centrifugation , denatured and freed of nucleic acids . Analysis by LC - MS / MS identified 128 CroV CDSs , 1 CroV URF , 1 Mavirus CDS , and 2 phage307 CDSs . Table 3 . 1 lists all viral proteins identified in this study . The single CroV URF identified by LC - MS / MS was only 47 aa long and therefore below the length cutoff of 50 aa used for gene finding in the CroV genome ( see section 2 . 2 . 4 ) . This URF was subsequently upgraded to CDS crov299a . A search of the GenBank non - redundant database was performed to identify potential contaminants and returned significant hits for trypsin ( the enzyme used for protein digestion ) , benzonase from Serratia marcescens ( the enzyme used for nucleic acid degradation ) , keratin ( a common contaminant introduced during sample handling ) , and actin from Bos taurus . No other eukaryotic proteins were found , suggesting that the purified CroV sample was free of cellular debris from lysed flagellates . However , with no sequence information available about the host genome , it was not possible to conduct a targeted search for host protein contamination . The absence of bacterial proteins indicates that the CroV purification protocol was highly efficient in removing the mixed bacterial assembly that was present in enriched seawater cultures of C . roenbergensis . A relative abundance ( RA ) index was calculated for each identified protein as an approximate measure of protein stoichiometry , based on the number of obtained mass spectra and the number of expected spectra based on protein sequence ; RA values do not reflect absolute protein quantities . Genes coding for proteins packaged in the CroV virion are distributed relatively uniformly across the CroV genome , as is revealed when these genes are ordered against their gene numbers ( Fig . 3 . 1 ) . Therefore , virion proteins are not preferentially encoded by any particular region of the genome . However , a large gap in the middle of the plot indicates that the 42 proteins encoded by CDSs crov241 to crov282 are absent from the virion proteome . These CDSs coincide with a 38 kbp genomic region that was found to differ from the rest of the CroV genome in terms of promoter regions and coding content and is presumably of bacterial origin ( see 80 section 2 . 3 . 12 ) . The genes in this region code for enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism , including a complete biosynthetic pathway of 3 - deoxy - D - manno - octulosonate ( also known as KDO ) , which is an essential component of the cell walls in plants and bacteria [ 227 ] . None of the proteins from this region were found to be packaged in the virion . The terminal regions of the CroV genome also deviate slightly from the central part ( Fig . 3 . 1 ) . The slope of the first 10 virion proteins is steeper than the rest , indicating that fewer proteins from the 5 ' - end of the assembled genome are packaged . Similarly , the 3 ' - terminal region of the assembled genome is only sparsely represented in the virion proteome , as only one of the proteins encoded by crov499 - crov544 was identified by LC - MS / MS analysis . These observations can potentially be ascribed to the transitory nature of these genomic regions , being located between the highly repetitive terminal regions ( for which no sequence information is available ) and the central protein - coding part of the genome . With 129 virus - encoded proteins packaged , CroV possesses one of the most complex virus particles known . Of the 129 CroV proteins , 82 are of unknown function ; this represents 64 % of the virion proteins and is comparable to the 57 % of proteins found in the Mimivirus virion proteome that were of unknown function [ 68 ] . Among the CroV proteins with functional annotations , five major categories can be distinguished : virion structure , transcription , DNA repair , protein modification , and oxidative pathways ( Table 3 . 2 ) .

Proteins were binned by function based on matches to Pfam , Interpro , and NCBI COG and nr databases ( see section 2 . 2 . 4 ) . Functional category Number of proteins found in CroV virion Transcription 17 Protein modification & turnover 7 DNA repair 6 Structure 6 Oxidative pathways 5 Others 6 Unknown 82 90 3 . 3 . 2 Structural proteins All four predicted capsid proteins encoded by CroV were identified in this study , albeit with very different RA values ( Table 3 . 1 ) . The major capsid protein is the most abundant structural protein with 2453 mass spectra and an RA value of 48 . 10 , followed by the major core protein with 1938 spectra and an RA value of 21 . 78 . Another predicted structural component present in the virion is a phage tail collar domain protein ( 214 spectra , RA = 10 . 70 ) . It is noteworthy that no peptides were found to match the predicted P9 / A32 - like DNA - pumping ATPase of the FtsK - HerA family ( CROV338 ) , which are molecular motors that use ATP to translocate viral genomes into prefabricated capsids [ 228 ] . The P9 / A32 ATPase is a known virion component in internal membrane - containing dsDNA viruses such as bacteriophage PRD1 [ 229 ] , but has not been detected in proteomic studies of vaccinia virus ( VV ) [ 225 , 230 - 232 ] or EhV - 86 [ 224 ] , and was statistically only poorly supported in the Mimivirus proteome [ 59 ] . Therefore , the genome packaging ATPases in these viruses may be only transiently associated with the virion during particle assembly or may be present in too few copies to be detected by mass spectrometry . Apart from these proteins , which are homologues of well - described structural proteins , it is likely that a complex virus particle such as the CroV virion consists of many additional proteinaceous components . To identify potential structural candidates among the 82 proteins of unknown function , I compared the RA values of predicted structural and non - structural proteins . Among the 41 annotated non - structural proteins , the predicted protein disulfide isomerase crov172 had the highest RA value ( 3 . 42 ) , whereas the three most abundant structural proteins had RA values ranging from 10 . 70 to 48 . 10 ( Table 3 . 1 ) . Based on the observed difference , I considered any protein with an RA value of 10 or greater as a candidate for a structural virion component . This was the case for CDSs crov187 , crov240 , crov318 , and crov320 , which had RA values of 11 . 53 , 47 . 00 , 10 . 21 , and 27 . 64 , respectively . These four proteins may therefore represent major constituents of the CroV virion structure . Since two of them ( crov240 and crov320 ) are predicted transmembrane ( TM ) proteins , they may interact with the internal lipid membranes ( see section 5 . 3 . 4 ) . A total of 33 proteins ( 26 % ) identified in this study are predicted to contain one or more transmembrane helices ( TMHs , Table 3 . 1 ) . This is far less than the 82 % ( 23 of 28 ) of coccolithovirus EhV - 86 virion proteins that are predicted to contain TMHs [ 224 ] . However , EhV - 86 contains an outer membrane , which it acquires during budding from the host membrane [ 233 ] , and may therefore need to anchor proteins in its lipid envelope to mediate host recognition and cell entry . In contrast , only 12 % of virion proteins in Mimivirus , which does not contain an outer lipid envelope , are predicted TM proteins , as revealed by TMHMM analysis of the Mimivirus virion proteome [ 68 ] . The total number of predicted TM proteins encoded by CroV 91 is 69 , and 33 of them are present in the virion . Therefore , proteins with predicted TMHs are overrepresented in the CroV virion ( Fisher ' s exact test , p - value 2 . 7x10 - 6 ) , suggesting that TM proteins are essential for the CroV virion , e . g . for structural integrity of the internal lipid membranes . 3 . 3 . 3 Transcription components Transcription - related proteins constitute the largest class of predicted non - structural proteins present in the CroV virion . The packaged transcription machinery consists of eight DNA - directed RNA polymerase II subunits ( Rpb1 , 2 , 3 / 11 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 ) , two predicted early transcription factors ( VV D6 - like TF and VV A7 - like TF ) , transcription elongation factor TFIIS , two VV D11 - like TFs , a trifunctional mRNA capping enzyme , polyadenylate polymerase catalytic subunit , DNA topoisomerase IB , and an RNA helicase ( Table 3 . 1 ) . CroV may thus be able to initiate gene transcription immediately upon penetration of the host cell . The Rpb2 gene contains a 146 aa long intein insertion in its RNA polymerases beta chain signature motif ( see section 2 . 3 . 8 ) . This intein ( like the other three CroV inteins ) exhibits all the conserved residues necessary for self - splicing , although there are no experimental data demonstrating that this intein is functional and can remove itself from the host protein ( = extein ) after translation . Proteomic analysis by LC - MS / MS would be a suitable method to answer this question , if peptides spanning the splice junction were detected . A peptide matching the intein sequence would prove that the intein is packaged , either in its integrated or in its spliced form . A peptide containing part of the extein and part of the intein would be evidence that no protein splicing has occurred . A peptide containing extein sequences from both the N - terminal and C - terminal splice junctions without amino acids from the intein would prove that the extein parts are spliced together correctly and that the intein is functional . Despite 281 peptide spectra and 52 % coverage of the Rpb2 protein in this study , no peptides were found that crossed the splice sites or contained any intein residues ( Fig . 3 . 2 ) . Although the intein sequence represents the longest continuous region of the precursor Rpb2 for which no peptide spectrum was found , potentially indicating the absence of the intein , there is no direct evidence for successful intein splicing either , because the theoretical tryptic peptide spanning the splice junction ( FSTK ) would have been too short to be unambiguously identified . 92 Figure 3 . 2 Proteomic peptide coverage of the DNA - dependent RNA polymerase II subunit 2 precursor . The intein element is printed in bold letters , peptides identified in this study are shown in red , and residues after which tryptic cleavage could occur are underlined . 3 . 3 . 4 DNA repair enzymes Interestingly , six of the identified virion proteins are predicted DNA repair enzymes . Among them are two putative DNA photolyases , a CPD class I photolyase , and a photolyase - like protein that is phylogenetically related to a recently discovered class of bacterial and euryarchaeal photolyases / cryptochromes ( see section 2 . 3 . 3 ) . Thus , DNA photodamage could be repaired inside the CroV particle . Such a case of intra - virion DNA photorepair has been demonstrated in Fowlpox virus [ 234 ] and could therefore exist in other viruses . With the exception of AP endonuclease , all enzymes of the predicted base excision repair ( BER ) pathway in CroV are packaged : formamidopyrimidine - DNA glycosylase , family X DNA polymerase , and NAD - dependent DNA ligase . The low RA values of these proteins ( 0 . 06 - 0 . 26 ) suggest that only few copies of these enzymes are present in the virus particle . It is therefore possible that the missing BER enzyme , AP endonuclease , was also present , but below the detection limit of this study . The set of virion - located DNA repair enzymes is completed by the CROV200 protein , which contains a 3 ' - 5 ' exonuclease domain that may be involved in DNA mismatch repair . This is the most extensive DNA repair machinery ever found in a virus particle . Functional studies will be necessary to further characterize these enzymes and elucidate their role in the CroV virion . 93 3 . 3 . 5 Redox proteins The CroV virion contains three predicted thiol oxidoreductases and two protein disulfide isomerases ( PDIs ) . Enzymes of the PDI family are able to form and break disulfide bonds in other proteins and are involved in a variety of cellular processes , such as oxidative protein folding and antigen presentation [ 190 ] . Disulfide bonds also play an important role in many viruses , e . g . during virus entry and for stabilization of structural virion proteins . For instance , simian virus 40 uncoating is mediated by a cellular oxidoreductase [ 235 ] . In HIV - 1 , a PDI is probably required for virion entry , as it cleaves two disulfide bonds of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 which interacts with the CD4 receptor , inducing virus - cell fusion [ 236 ] . Although CroV does not have an external lipid envelope , PDIs could nevertheless play a role in CroV - cell membrane fusion events , e . g . to release the CroV genome from the membrane - bound virion core . However , it seems more likely that these redox proteins assist in the folding of structural proteins within the cytoplasmic virion factory . Oxidative protein folding normally occurs in specialized cellular compartments , such as the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and the intermembrane space of mitochondria . The cytosol , on the other hand , is a reducing environment and cysteine residues exposed to the cytosol will preferentially exist in their reduced form , i . e . sulfhydryl groups . A virus that replicates and assembles its virions in the cytoplasm must therefore find a way to catalyze the formation of disulfide bonds in this reducing environment . Members of the NCLDV clade are especially interesting to study cytosolic disulfide bond formation , because their particles are assembled in large cytoplasmic virion factories , spatially separated from the ER , mitochondria , and the intracellular membrane system . Studies in vaccinia virus revealed a new cytosolic redox pathway for protein disulfide bond formation , which is catalyzed by three viral oxidoreductases , E10 , A2 . 5 , and G4 [ 237 ] . The oxidizing potential in vaccinia virus is transferred from the ERV1 / ALR - family thiol oxidoreductase E10 [ 238 ] via A2 . 5 to the thioredoxin G4 , which in turn catalyzes disulfide bond formation in various viral substrates . A comparison of the poxvirus redox components to predicted redox proteins encoded and packaged by CroV and Mimivirus suggests that analogous pathways may exist in these two giant viruses . The VV E10 protein shares conserved residues with the thiol oxidoreductases R596 in Mimivirus and CroV proteins CROV143 and CROV444 , all of which are predicted members of the ERV1 / ALR family of FAD - binding sulfhydryl oxidases ( Fig . 3 . 3 ) . The most likely homologues of VV thioredoxin G4 are the predicted thioredoxins MIMI _ R443 and CROV379 ( Fig . 3 . 4 ) . 94 Figure 3 . 3 Sequence alignment of Erv1 / Alr - family thiol oxidoreductases . The catalytic pairs of cysteines are shaded in black ; boxed residues have been shown to participate in FAD binding [ 239 ] . GenBank accession numbers are as follows : Saccaromyces cerevisiae Erv2p , NP _ 015362 ; VV E10 , YP _ 232948 ; Mimivirus R596 , YP _ 003987112 . Figure 3 . 4 Sequence alignment of thioredoxins related to the vaccinia virus G4 protein . The catalytic pairs of cysteines are shaded in black ; residues conserved in at least three organisms are shown in boldface type . GenBank accession numbers are as follows : Human TRX , NP _ 003320 ; VV G4 , YP _ 232963 ; Mimivirus R443 , YP _ 003986950 . 95 The thioredoxin - like protein CROV172 is also similar to the VV G4 protein , but has only one cysteine in its active site and may thus have reduced or missing redox activity ( Fig . 3 . 4 ) . No potential homologues of the VV A2 . 5 protein were found in either CroV or Mimivirus ; however , it is possible that one of the remaining packaged redox proteins in these viruses may have adopted the role of VV A2 . 5 . The finding that homologous components of a well characterized poxvirus redox pathway are also packaged in CroV and Mimivirus , strongly suggests that these giant viruses experience similar constraints , which requires the catalytic ability for protein disulfide bond formation within the virion . Furthermore , it can be assumed that this conserved viral redox pathway was already present in the common ancestor of CroV , Mimivirus , and the poxviruses , which are members of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus ( NCLDV ) group . It has recently been proposed that the NCLDV ancestor may already have been endowed with the ability of disulfide bond formation , and that viral redox pathways may have predated oxidative protein folding in eukaryotic organelles [ 240 ] , since the origin of the NCLDVs is proposed to coincide with or even predate the emergence of eukaryotes [ 52 ] . 3 . 3 . 6 Comparison with microarray data A temporal gene expression study using a custom - designed DNA microarray revealed that at least 274 CroV genes are transcriptionally active during the infection cycle ( see section 2 . 3 . 10 ) . The proteome data offers an opportunity to evaluate the microarray results from a different angle . For example , viral proteins detected in the virion must have been transcribed and translated during infection . The proteome data can thus be used to validate the microarray results . Furthermore , virion proteins may be preferentially expressed at a certain period of the infection cycle , e . g . during the early or late stage of the virus life cycle . Figure 3 . 5 summarizes the gene expression data for CroV virion proteins . Of those virion proteins whose genes were found to be expressed , 28 were first expressed during the early infection stage ( 0 - 3 h p . i . ) and 41 were first expressed during the late stage ( 6 h p . i . or later ) . All structural genes identified in the microarray study were first transcribed during the late stage ( Table 3 . 1 ) . Conversely , 17 of the 41 functionally annotated non - structural virion proteins were expressed early and only 8 were expressed late . This indicates that genes encoding structural virion components are transcribed during the late stage of CroV infection . Among the virion proteins of unknown function , 11 were first expressed during the early stage , and 27 during the late stage . Remarkably , no transcriptional activity was found for 44 confirmed virion components . Clearly , these genes must have been expressed and accordingly , the microarray study must have missed these transcripts . One possible explanation is that the expression levels of these genes were too low to be detected in the microarray study . Although this hypothesis cannot be tested 96 thoroughly , a rough measure of protein abundance is given by the RA values . Virion proteins that had not been found in the microarray study had an average RA value of 1 . 13 ( ranging from 0 . 04 to 5 . 37 , lowest and highest 5 % excluded ) , compared to an average RA of 1 . 76 for virion proteins with confirmed expression ( ranging from 0 . 06 to 11 . 53 ) . These numbers suggest that low expression levels are unlikely to have caused the observed discrepancy between transcriptomic and proteomic results . Other reasons may lie in preferential degradation of certain mRNA species , quantitative bias introduced during cDNA synthesis , PCR amplification , and fluorescent labelling of cDNAs , or insufficient hybridization of labelled cDNAs with the immobilized oligonucleotide probes . Regardless of the reasons , the LC - MS / MS analysis clearly showed that the microarray analysis underestimated the true extent of transcriptional activity in CroV . Interestingly , 35 % of all CroV genes tested in the microarray study were found to be transcriptionally silent ( see section 2 . 3 . 10 ) , which is almost equivalent to the 34 % of confirmed virion proteins with undetectable levels of gene expression . This suggests that nearly all 544 predicted CroV genes could be expressed during infection , which would agree with recent transcriptomic studies in Mimivirus and PBCV - 1 [ 69 , 208 ] . Figure 3 . 5 Time - resolved transcriptome data of CroV virion proteins . Numbers indicate how many CroV CDSs with packaged gene products belonged to each category . 3 . 3 . 7 Comparison with CroV promoters Two distinct promoter motifs have been identified in CroV ( see section 2 . 3 . 11 ) . Genes transcribed early during infection are mostly associated with the " AAAAATTGA " sequence motif , which is located about 40 - 50 nt upstream of the start codon ( Fig . 2 . 24 ) . Another motif , 97 consisting of the conserved tetramer " TCTA " flanked by AT - rich regions , is located near nucleotide position - 15 and is linked to genes that are first transcribed during the late stage of CroV infection ( i . e . at 6 h p . i . or later ) . Forty - nine ( 38 % ) of the 129 genes whose products we found to be packaged are associated with the late promoter motif ( Table 3 . 1 ) ; only 12 proteins ( 9 % ) are associated with the early promoter motif and all of them are predicted non - structural proteins ( seven RNA polymerase subunits , TFIIS , DNA polymerase X , ADP - ribosylglyco - hydrolase , a methyltransferase , and an amino acid transporter ) . Therefore , all virion proteins of unknown function are either associated with the late promoter motif ( 36 cases ) or are encoded by genes for which no promoter motif could be identified ( 42 cases ) . Considering that 8 of the 10 genes encoding structural proteins are associated with the late promoter motif , it can be inferred that many of the virion proteins of unknown function are likely to play a structural role . 3 . 3 . 8 CroV and Mimivirus share a conserved set of virion proteins Virion proteomes of other NCLDV members have been elucidated , including VV [ 225 , 230 - 232 ] , Singapore grouper iridovirus [ 222 ] , Mimivirus [ 68 ] , and the phycodnaviruses EhV - 86 [ 224 ] and PBCV - 1 ( D . D . Dunigan and J . Van Etten , personal communication ) . Of these viruses , only VV , PBCV - 1 and Mimivirus virions have a similarly complex protein composition as CroV . At least 7 of the 80 VV proteins that are part of the mature virion [ 225 , 231 , 232 ] have homologues in CroV , and , except for the A18 helicase , are also found in the CroV proteome . In addition to the redox proteins E10 and G4 , which are probably functional homologues of CroV proteins CROV143 and CROV379 ( despite a lack of significant sequence similarity ) , the virions of CroV and VV contain at least six homologous proteins . These are the major core protein P4 , RNA polymerase subunits 1 and 2 ( VV J6 and A24 ) , and transcription factors A7 , D6 , and D11 . Therefore , CroV and VV virions overlap mostly by transcription - related proteins , which constitute 25 % of the proteins in the VV mature virion [ 225 ] . Proteomics of Mimivirus particles using LC - MS / MS and MALDI - TOF - MS led to the identification of 114 viral proteins [ 68 ] . Re - evaluation of this dataset by Claverie et al . [ 59 ] added 23 statistically well supported proteins to the list , raising the total number of Mimivirus virion proteins to 137 . I compared these 137 Mimivirus proteins to the 129 CroV proteins identified in this study . Using a BLASTP E - value cutoff of 10 - 5 , 52 of the 129 CroV CDSs have at least one significantly similar sequence in the Mimivirus genome , and 33 of the 129 CroV virion proteins are significantly similar to a virion protein from Mimivirus ( Table 3 . 1 ) . Although the DNA topoisomerase IB proteins of CroV and Mimivirus do not share significant sequence similarity , they can be considered functional homologues ( see section 2 . 3 . 4 ) and were therefore included in the following comparative analysis . The predicted hypothetical protein crov330 is encoded by 98 two adjacent genes in Mimivirus , which results in a slight difference in the number of CroV - Mimivirus homologues , depending on the virus viewpoint . I here define the number of shared proteins as the number of CroV proteins that have homologues in Mimivirus . Hence , the virion proteomes of CroV and Mimivirus overlap by 34 proteins . Figure 3 . 6 shows a side - by - side comparison of the virion proteomes of CroV and Mimivirus . Of the 34 shared proteins , only 7 have no functional annotation , which is remarkable considering that 64 % of the CroV virion proteins and about half of the virion proteins in Mimivirus have no known function . This implies that most of the packaged proteins of unknown function in CroV and Mimivirus are lineage specific . They may represent structural components that could be required to build the different architectures of the CroV and Mimivirus virions , or they may play a role in virus - host interaction , such as determining host specificity or modulating host defence . It is significant that the virions of these related , yet so different giant viruses package functionally similar enzymes . Both virions contain a large transcription machinery that consists of a multi - subunit RNA polymerase , early transcription factors , DNA topoisomerase IB , and enzymes for mRNA capping and polyadenylation . They package several DNA repair enzymes including a nuclease and a family X DNA polymerase . The prokaryotic photolyase encoded and packaged by CroV is homologous to two ORFs in Mimivirus that are separated by a predicted transposase , but none of these Mimivirus proteins were found to be part of the virion . Therefore , the Mimivirus photolyase was probably inactivated by insertion of the transposase . Mimivirus and CroV virions share two redox proteins , three enzymes involved in protein modifications ( kinase , phosphatase , protease ) , and further enzymes such as a phosphoesterase and a methyltransferase . The shared proteome is completed by seven proteins of unknown function and three structural proteins , the major capsid protein , the major core protein , and one of the four newly predicted structural proteins in CroV , CROV318 , with its Mimivirus homologue L485 . 3 . 3 . 9 Proteins from Mavirus and phage307 CroV is associated with a small virus parasite , the Mavirus virophage ( see chapter 4 ) . The Mavirus virion is ~ 60 nm in diameter and should not have been retained by the 0 . 2 µm TFF membrane during CroV purification . However , some Mavirus virions likely ended up in the CroV sample used for LC - MS / MS analysis , as did phage307 , which infects an unknown marine bacterium . The full genome sequences for these viruses are available ( see chapter 4 and Appendix E ) and the peptide mass spectra obtained in this study were searched against a database that also contained ORFs from these two viruses . Ten spectra matched Mavirus CDS18 , which encodes the predicted major capsid protein of the virophage ( Table 3 . 1 ) . 99 Figure 3 . 6 The shared virion proteome of CroV and Mimivirus . * Counting CroV proteins . A homologue of crov330 is encoded by two Mimivirus genes , the 34 CroV proteins therefore correspond to 35 Mimivirus proteins . 100 Phage307 had two statistically supported protein hits , a predicted 37 kDa protein which most likely represents the major capsid protein , and a 14 kDa protein of unknown function . The virions of Mavirus and phage307 are likely to contain further proteins , but since these viruses were not specifically targeted by this proteome study , and were therefore only present as minor contaminants , one would not expect to find minor virion proteins . 3 . 4 Conclusions This chapter describes the protein composition of the CroV particle . With 129 packaged proteins , the virion complexity of CroV is rivalled only by Mimivirus . Analysis of the virion proteome in the light of genomic and transcriptomic data of CroV , as well as comparison of this dataset with other virion proteomes , especially with Mimivirus , resulted in valuable new information about the biology and evolution of CroV . Virion proteomics revealed that protein packaging in CroV and other giant viruses is likely to be a selective and non - random process , since the virions of VV , Mimivirus and CroV contain a select set of enzymes such as transcription and DNA repair proteins . Whereas the targeted incorporation of structural components such as capsid and core proteins might be explained by self - assembly ( although this seems unlikely given the complex architecture of giant virus particles and unique capsid features such as the stargate opening in Mimivirus ) , the mechanism of molecular sorting for non - structural proteins such as RNA polymerases and DNA repair enzymes is completely unknown . Similarly , the intra - virion location of non - structural as well as structural proteins , including the 33 virion proteins with predicted transmembrane domains , remains unknown . Integration of transcriptomics and proteomics suggests that a previous microarray study on CroV gene expression did not uncover the true transcriptional potential of CroV and that almost all predicted CroV genes may be expressed during infection . CroV genes that encode predicted structural proteins are preferentially expressed from 6 h p . i . onwards and contain the late promoter motif ( TCTA ) in their 5 ' upstream region . The non - structural proteins packaged by CroV fall into distinct categories : transcription , DNA repair , disulfide bond formation , and protein modification . It can therefore be assumed that these enzymatic functions are crucial for the CroV infection strategy . The discovery of several virion - located DNA repair enzymes suggests that DNA damage can be repaired during the extracellular phase of the virus akin to photorepair in poxvirus particles [ 234 ] , or immediately upon virus entry into the host cell . The extensive array of CroV - encoded transcription 101 components present in the virion strongly suggests that early transcription in CroV occurs within the confinements of the inner virion core . Such a cytoplasmic intra - core transcription is known only from poxviruses and Mimivirus [ 54 , 241 , 242 ] . For this purpose , the poxvirus VV packages ~ 22 transcription - related proteins including 8 RNA polymerase subunits [ 243 ] , and Mimivirus particles contain a similarly comprehensive set of least 14 transcriptional components including 6 RNA polymerase subunits [ 59 , 68 ] . Likewise , CroV packages 7 RNA polymerase subunits and 9 other transcription proteins and should therefore be capable of carrying out early gene transcription in its core . Finally , this study revealed that CroV and Mimivirus , the two largest and most complex viruses known , share a significant fraction of their virion proteomes . Although a third of the CroV CDSs have homologues in Mimivirus , the two viruses differ markedly in genome and particle size , genome organization , host specificity ( CroV infects a chromalveolate , Mimivirus a unikont ) , and natural environment ( CroV was isolated from the Gulf of Mexico , Mimivirus from the freshwater of a cooling tower ) . It is therefore highly significant that CroV and Mimivirus contain a common set of 34 virion proteins . Even more remarkably , 27 of the 34 shared proteins have well - characterized homologues in cells or other viruses , which is a rather unusual condition given that typically less than 35 % of new viral sequences display similarity to previously described genes , and even less have a putative function [ 244 ] . The shared set of virion proteins includes redox proteins , DNA repair enzymes , and a large set of transcription enzymes . This implies that the common ancestor of CroV and Mimivirus , and perhaps even the NCLDV ancestor , already possessed a virion that was endowed with these biochemical functions . A speculative projection of this idea leads to the hypothesis that oxidative protein folding might be a viral invention [ 240 ] . The ancient evolutionary origin of the virion proteome is further corroborated by the absence of gene products crov241 - crov282 from the CroV virion proteome . These CDSs are located within a 38 kbp genomic region that displays neither early nor late promoter motifs , encodes sugar - modifying enzymes with bacterial affiliation , and lacks homologues in Mimivirus . This suggests that the 38 kbp region was a relatively recent addition to the CroV genome . The integration of these genes , probably from a bacterial source , must have taken place after the CroV lineage had split from the Mimivirus lineage , and probably occurred after the molecular sorting system for virion proteins in giant viruses had evolved . 102 4 Mavirus , a Novel Virophage Associated with CroV 14 4 . 1 Synopsis DNA transposons are mobile genetic elements that have shaped the genomes of eukaryotes for millions of years by creating new alleles , influencing gene regulation and rearranging chromosome structure [ 245 ] , yet their origins remain obscure . In this chapter , I report the discovery of a virophage that , based on genetic homology , represents an evolutionary link between double - stranded DNA viruses and Maverick / Polinton transposable elements ( MP TEs ) of eukaryotes . The Mavirus virophage parasitizes the giant Cafeteria roenbergensis virus and encodes 20 predicted proteins , including a retroviral integrase and a protein - primed DNA polymerase B . Based on the biology of virophages and the genetic similarity of the Mavirus virophage and MP TEs , the data presented here provide persuasive evidence that MP TEs are derived from an ancient relative of Mavirus , although alternative evolutionary scenarios are possible . These results shed further light on the profound ways in which viruses may have influenced the evolution of cellular life . 4 . 2 Materials and methods 4 . 2 . 1 Culture conditions and virophage purification Cafeteria roenbergensis strain E4 - 10 was isolated from coastal waters near Yaquina Bay , OR , USA , as described previously [ 135 ] . Mavirus strain Spezl was originally isolated from the same concentrated sea water sample as CroV [ 101 ] , but remained undetected until 2009 , when its genome had amplified sufficiently through serial propagation to produce a contig with 454 pyrosequencing . The existence of Mavirus was visually confirmed by thin - section transmission electron microscopy ( see chapter 5 ) . C . roenbergensis strain E4 - 10 culture conditions have been described in section 2 . 2 . 1 . Cultures were infected with CroV and Mavirus and the resulting lysates were centrifuged for 1 h at 10 , 500 x g in a Sorvall RC - 5C centrifuge ( GSA rotor , 4°C ) to pellet bacteria and cell debris . The supernatant was subjected to tangential flow filtration ( TFF ) using a Vivaflow 200 , 0 . 2 µm PES unit ( Sartorius Mechatronics , Canada ) . CroV particles were mostly retained in the concentrate , whereas the Mavirus - containing filtrate was further concentrated in a Vivaflow 200 , 100 , 000 MWCO PES unit . The Mavirus Vivaflow concentrate 14 A version of this chapter has been published : Fischer M . G . and Suttle C . A . ( 2011 ) A virophage at the origin of large DNA transposons . Science , March 3 , DOI : 10 . 1126 / science . 1199412 . 103 was centrifuged for 30 min at 3 , 000 g in an Eppendorf 5810 tabletop centrifuge to pellet any residual aggregated material . The supernatant was centrifuged for 1 h at 70 , 000 x g in a Sorvall RC80 ultracentrifuge ( SW40 rotor , 20°C ) . Pellets from two consecutive ultracentrifuge runs were stacked for increased virophage concentration , suspended in a minimal volume of 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , and filtered through a 0 . 1 µm pore size syringe filter ( Durapore® , PVDF , 33 mm diameter , Millipore , U . S . A . ) . The purified and concentrated virophage suspension was used for infection experiments . 4 . 2 . 2 Genome sequencing and annotation The Mavirus genome was sequenced as part of the CroV genome sequencing project , as described previously ( see section 2 . 2 . 3 ) [ 32 ] . Pyrosequencing on a 454 GS FLX platform ( McGill University and Génome Québec Innovation Centre , Montréal , QC , Canada ) yielded an 18 , 973 bp contig with 13 - fold coverage . Oligonucleotide primers were designed to test the contig for circular configuration : forward primer 1 5 ' - CACAGGATATTTCAGAACCAACGC - 3 ' ( T m = 56 . 3°C ) ; forward primer 2 5 ' - TGTATTTAACAATTTAGGAGATTCAG - 3 ' ( T m = 49 . 6°C ) ; reverse primer 1 5 ' - TGCTTCTTATGCTTGAAATGTTCC - 3 ' ( T m = 54 . 1°C ) ; reverse primer 2 5 ' - GTTTTATTTGGGTTTCCTTCTATAAG - 3 ' ( T m = 50 . 5°C ) . Amplifications with different primer combinations were carried out in 25 µl PCR reactions containing 4 ng template DNA , 1 µM of each primer , 1 M betaine , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM dNTPs , and 0 . 5 units of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase ( Invitrogen , Canada ) . PCR cycle parameters consisted of a single denaturation step for 5 min at 95°C , followed by 35 cycles for 30 sec at 95°C , 1 min at 56°C , and 3 min at 72°C with a temperature rate of 1°C / sec , and a final extension step for 12 min at 72°C . Resulting PCR products were sequenced directly . The complete genome sequence was annotated using Artemis software v12 . 0 [ 145 ] . Functional predictions for CDSs were made on the basis of Pfam and BlastP searches , combined with multiple sequence alignments created with T - Coffee [ 246 ] and Muscle [ 155 ] to identify conserved protein sites . MrBayes v3 . 1 . 2 was used for phylogenetic analysis with rates = gamma , aamodelpr = mixed settings and tree generation following the majority rule consensus method [ 158 ] . Phylogenetic trees were displayed using FigTree v1 . 3 . 1 15 15 http : / / tree . bio . ed . ac . uk / software / figtree . Sequences for phylogenetic analysis were chosen in order to represent the taxonomic spectrum of the respective protein . The Mavirus promoter motif was identified by visual inspection of aligned intergenic regions and statistically verified using MEME ( E - value 8x10 - 9 ) [ 153 ] . BioEdit v7 . 0 . 5 . 3 [ 247 ] was used to visualize the alignments in Figs . 4 . 2 and 4 . 7 . Isoelectric points were predicted using the 104 Greengene software 16 4 . 2 . 3 Co - infection experiments . The genome sequence of Mavirus strain Spezl was deposited in GenBank under the accession number HQ712116 . Triplicate 50 ml cultures of exponentially growing C . roenbergensis cells ) in modified f / 2 enriched sea water medium ( see section 2 . 2 . 1 ) were infected with either 50 μl of 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 ( mock infection ) , 50 μl of CroV lysate , 50 μl of CroV lysate + 25 μl of concentrated Mavirus suspension , or 25 μl of concentrated Mavirus suspension . Cell densities were monitored until 8 days p . i . by staining 100 µl of culture with 10 µl of Lugol ' s Acid Iodine solution and counting cells on a hemocytometer . The concentration of CroV particles was measured by epifluorescence microscopy ( EFM ) after staining with SYBR Gold , as described in detail by Suttle & Fuhrman [ 144 ] . Briefly , 10 µl of culture were mixed with 20 µl of 25 % EM - grade glutaraldehyde ( Canemco , Canada ) in 970 µl of dH 2 O and incubated for 20 min at 4°C . 800 µl of the fixed sample were then filtered onto a 0 . 02 μm pore size , 25 mm diameter Anodisc Al 2 O 3 filter ( Whatman , Canada ) and the filter was stained for 17 min in SYBR Gold ( Invitrogen , Canada ) . Stained filters were mounted onto glass microscope slides and examined on an Olympus AX70 microscope under a blue filter . Fluorescent CroV particles were easily distinguishable from bacteria and flagellate cells due to their brightness and symmetrically round shape . Mavirus virions were too small to be counted by EFM under these conditions . 4 . 2 . 4 Quantitative PCR To analyze Mavirus genome replication , quantitative real - time PCR ( qPCR ) targeting a 159 bp region of the Mavirus DNA polB gene was performed with DNA extracted from infected and mock - infected cultures . Triplicate cultures containing 50 ml of exponentially growing C . roenbergensis ( 9x10 4 cells / ml ) in f / 2 enriched sea water medium were either mock - infected ( + 25 µl of 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 ) , infected with 25 μl of concentrated Mavirus suspension , or in fected with 50 µl of CroV lysate + 25 μl of concentrated Mavirus suspension . Subsamples of 200 µl were taken 5 min before infection , 5 min post infection ( p . i . ) , 6 h p . i . , and 24 h p . i . , and DNA was extracted from these samples following the " Blood or Body Fluids " protocol of the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit ( Qiagen , Mississauga , ON , Canada ) with a single elution step in 100 µl nuclease - free H 2 O ( Invitrogen , Canada ) . DNA was quantified on a Nanodrop spectrophotometer . A 25 µl qPCR reaction contained 1 μl DNA template , 400 nM of each primer ( forward primer Spezl - qPCR - 1 , 5 ' - ATGGTGCGACTTTTACTTATG - 3 ' , T m = 58°C ; reverse primer Spezl - qPCR - 2 , 5 ' - AAGGGGTTATATTTTCCATTAG - 3 ' , T m = 58°C ) , 16 http : / / greengene . uml . edu / programs / FindMW . html 105 and 12 . 5 µl of iQ SYBR Green Supermix ( Bio - Rad , Canada ) . qPCR amplification was carried out on a Bio - Rad Opticon 2 instrument . The amplification protocol consisted of a single denaturation step for 10 min at 95°C , followed by 45 cycles for 20 sec at 95°C , 20 sec at 55°C , and 15 sec at 72°C with a temperature rate of 2°C / sec . PCR amplification with primers Spezl - qPCR - 1 and Spezl - qPCR - 2 yielded a single product of ~ 160 bp , as verified by agarose gel electrophoresis . Fluorescence was measured after the extension step of each cycle and a final melting curve was recorded ( 55°C - 95°C in 0 . 5°C increments ) . The C T values for all no - template controls were above 45 ( i . e . out of range ) . 106 4 . 3 Results and discussion 4 . 3 . 1 Mavirus replication in Cafeteria roenbergensis During the characterization of Cafeteria roenbergensis virus ( CroV ) , a significantly smaller virus associated with infection by CroV was observed and sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing . This virus , named Mavirus ( for Maverick virus ) , caused in co - infected cultures a significant decline in CroV production and host cell lysis . As shown in Table 4 . 1 , cultures infected with CroV lysate declined after ~ 3 days post infection ( d p . i . ) and yielded 6x10 7 CroV virions per ml . When a concentrated Mavirus suspension was added together with the CroV inoculum , the flagellate population remained healthy and no CroV particles were detected by epifluorescent microscopy at 8 d p . i . . Addition of the concentrated Mavirus suspension to C . roenbergensis cultures in the absence of CroV had no observable effect on flagellate growth ( Table 4 . 1 ) . This indicates that Mavirus is not able to induce lysis in C . roenbergensis . The ability of Mavirus to replicate in C . roenbergensis in the presence and absence of CroV was examined by quantitative PCR . Table 4 . 2 shows the threshold cycle ( C T ) values for a 159 bp product of the Mavirus DNA polymerase B gene , determined for DNA samples extracted at different time points post infection . C T values are inversely proportional to the logarithm of the starting quantity of template DNA , i . e . higher initial copy numbers of the template sequence will result in lower C T values . In C . roenbergensis cells co - infected with CroV , Mavirus DNA was replicated , as indicated by the lower C T values at 24 h p . i . in Table 4 . 2 . In contrast , Mavirus did not replicate in the absence of CroV , as demonstrated by the consistently high C T values throughout infection . Mavirus was therefore classified as a virophage sensu La Scola et al . [ 31 ] , who coined the term " virophage " to emphasize the unique status of Sputnik , a small virus associated with Mimi - and Mamavirus , as a true virus parasite of another virus , which sets it apart from other satellite viruses ( see section 1 . 3 . 1 ) [ 31 , 105 ] . According to this definition , virophages are predicted to have no nuclear phase in their infection cycle , to replicate in the virion factory of their host virus , and to be dependent on enzymes provided by their host virus , rather than by the host cell . Support for this hypothesis comes from electron microscopy data showing Sputnik particles within the Mamavirus factory [ 31 ] , as well as from the finding that Sputnik shares highly specific regulatory DNA sequences ( promoter signals and transcriptional terminators ) with Mimivirus [ 69 , 105 ] . It can therefore be assumed that at least virophage transcription and capsid assembly occur within the virion factory of the host virus . However , further studies on gene expression and DNA replication of these viruses are necessary to validate and refine the virophage concept . 107 Table 4 . 1 Cell and virus concentrations during infection of C . roenbergensis with CroV and Mavirus . Cells were counted on a hemocytometer with a detection limit of 1 . 4x10 3 cells / ml . CroV particles were counted by epifluorescence microscopy , which had a detection limit of 2 . 4x10 5 viruses / ml . Cultures infected with CroV lysate declined at 3 days post infection ( p . i . ) , whereas cultures , to which purified Mavirus had been added , survived .

The genome was found to contain 20 predicted protein - coding sequences ( CDSs ) with an average length of 883 nt , which resulted in a genome coding density of 92 . 6 % . A nearly perfect inverted repeat of ~ 50 bp was situated in the intergenic region between CDSs MV20 and MV01 . This region has the potential to adopt a hairpin structure with a 43 bp stem and a 15 nt loop ( Fig . 4 . 1B ) . The adenine at the top of this hairpin loop was designated position 1 of the genome . Analysis of the intergenic regions revealed a conserved promoter motif ( Fig . 4 . 2 ) preceding all 20 CDSs and that is highly similar to a putative late promoter motif in CroV . This implies that Mavirus gene expression is governed by the transcription machinery of CroV during the late stage of infection . 108 Figure 4 . 1 The Mavirus genome . ( A ) Genome diagram of the Mavirus virophage . Circles from outermost to innermost represent CDSs on the forward strand , the location of promoter motifs , CDSs on the reverse strand , and GC content ( relative to the average of 30 . 26 % ) . Conserved MP TE genes are shown in red ; genes that are occasionally encoded by MP TEs are shown in blue . The FNIP / IP22 repeat - containing gene is shown in pink , additional genes with functional annotations are shaded yellow . A hairpin structure indicates the position of the inverted repeat upstream of MV01 . ( B ) DNA sequence and predicted secondary structure of the inverted repeat upstream of MV01 . The first and last bases of the genome are numbered . Ten Mavirus CDSs showed sequence similarity to proteins from eukaryotes , bacteria , retroviruses , and dsDNA viruses including at least four genes found in Sputnik ( Table 4 . 3 ) . The physical properties of the predicted Mavirus genes are listed in Table 4 . 4 . MV01 encodes a superfamily 3 helicase ( S3H ) similar to the D5 - like ATPases , which is thought to be the main replicative helicase in NCLDVs [ 50 ] . In contrast to NCLDVs , where the S3H domain is located at the C - terminus of a primase - helicase fusion protein [ 50 ] , the Mavirus S3H domain is located towards the N - terminus and is followed by a domain of unknown function . Remarkably , MV02 encodes an integrase that belongs to the rve superfamily of retroviral integrases ( Pfam entry PF00665 , E - value 1x10 - 16 ) . Retroviral integrases ( rve - INTs ) are usually expressed as part of the POL polyprotein in retroviruses , but rve - INTs have also been identified in a variety of eukaryotic genomes , where they occur independently of retroelements and have been termed cellular ( c - ) integrases [ 248 ] . 109 Figure 4 . 2 The Mavirus promoter motif . ( A ) Alignment of the 5 ' upstream regions of all 20 CDSs . The predicted start codons are printed in uppercase . The bottom line shows the 80 % consensus sequence . ( B ) Sequence logos of the Mavirus promoter motif , created from a gap - free alignment of all 20 promoter regions , and the predicted late promoter motif found in CroV ( S3 ) . ( C ) Comparison of the positional distribution of the ' TCTA ' promoter motifs in CroV and Mavirus . 110 Both the Mavirus integrase and the eukaryotic c - integrases contain a C - terminal CHROMO domain ( PF00385 , E - value 4x10 - 4 ) , which is a conserved region of ~ 60 aa capable of interacting with specific parts of the chromatin [ 248 , 249 ] . The CHROMO domain might thus be responsible for determining the target specificity of the Mavirus integrase . MV03 encodes a predicted protein - primed DNA polymerase B ( DNA _ pol _ B _ 2 , PF03175 , E - value 9x10 - 5 ) , with homologues in bacteriophages , adenoviruses , densoviruses , as well as mitochondrial genomes of plants and fungi . However , the closest homologue of Mavirus MV03 was found in the slime mould Polysphondylium pallidum ( Fig . 4 . 3 ) . Figure 4 . 3 Phylogenetic tree of protein - primed DNA - dependent DNA polymerase B . The unrooted Bayesian Inference tree was created from an alignment of conserved regions of protein - primed DNA pol B enzymes from selected adenoviruses , bacteriophages , linear mitochondrial plasmids , and MP TEs . Nodes are labeled with posterior probabilities and GenBank accession numbers are listed where available . Adenoviruses are shown in blue , bacteriophages in purple , linear mitochondrial plasmids in green , a sequence from Bombyx mori densovirus - 3 in orange , and MP TEs in black . Sequences labeled ( a ) were downloaded from RepBase [ 250 ] and MP TEs groups 1 + 2 correspond to POLB1 + 2 clades from Ref . [ 255 ] . 111 Interestingly , both Mavirus and P . pallidum DNA polymerases contain an insertion sequence in their catalytic site that may represent the remnants of an intein , inserted between the amino acid motifs YxG and TDG . With the putative intein sequence spliced out , the YxGTDG sequence corresponds to the YGDTDS catalytic motif found in B - family polymerases [ 250 ] . Inteins inserted at the exact same site of this motif have been found in other viruses , such as Mimivirus , CroV , HaV , and CeV ( see section 2 . 3 . 8 ) [ 196 , 197 ] . In contrast to these giant viruses , however , the Mavirus and P . pallidum inteins are extremely short with 58 aa and 55 aa , respectively ( Fig . 4 . 4 ) . The absence of the highly conserved Cys or Ser at the N - terminal splice junction and the missing Asn at the C - terminal splice junction suggests that these insertion sequences are incapable of self - excision , at least according to the traditional model of intein splicing [ 192 ] . MV06 contains the signature motif of GIY - YIG endonucleases ( PF01541 , 2x10 - 5 ) and MV13 exhibits an alpha / beta hydrolase domain similar to the ones found in lipases . MV15 bears Walker A , Walker B , and P9 / A32 - specific motifs , which define the DNA - pumping ATPases of the FtsK - HerA clade that are found in membrane - containing viruses ( Fig . 4 . 5 ) [ 251 ] . The adjacent gene , MV16 , encodes a predicted adenoviral cysteine protease that had its closest homologue in the Sputnik virophage ( Fig . 4 . 6 ) . Also similar to Sputnik was the predicted MCP encoded by MV18 . The capsid proteins of the two virophages shared no primary sequence similarity to other viruses , and both have been verified by proteomic analysis ( see section 3 . 3 . 9 ) [ 31 ] . The C - terminal domain of MV19 shows significant similarity to a cell wall surface anchor family protein from Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus ( BLASTP E - value 3x10 - 21 , 37 % identity over 168 amino acids ) . Finally , MV20 contains three FNIP / IP22 family repeats ( PF05725 , E - value 3x10 - 8 ) . These ~ 22 amino acid long repeats are present in Mimivirus , the slime moulds Dictyostelium discoideum and P . pallidum , the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus , and in the CroV genome , where they have expanded to more than 400 copies ( see section 2 . 3 . 9 ) [ 204 ] . It is interesting to note that the FNIP / IP22 repeats are located directly adjacent to the predicted hairpin structure , which might be involved in the initiation of genome replication . Future studies may be able to show if and how these repeats interact with the FNIP / IP22 repeats in the CroV genome . 112 Table 4 . 3 Mavirus gene annotations .

The discovery of Mavirus offers the first opportunity to compare Sputnik to another virophage . Sputnik has an icosahedral capsid with a diameter of 50 nm as determined by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) [ 31 , 254 ] , or 75 nm as determined by cryo - electron microscopy [ 104 ] . The Mavirus virion is also icosahedral and scales up to ~ 60 nm in diameter in TEM thin sections ( see Fig . 5 . 12 ) . The two virophages therefore have similar capsid morphologies and dimensions . The slightly larger capsid of Mavirus may be due to a minor genome size difference between Mavirus ( 19 , 063 bp ) and Sputnik ( 18 , 343 bp ) . Both virus genomes are circular and have high AT contents , 69 . 4 % A + T for Mavirus and 73 . 0 % A + T for Sputnik . However , the Sputnik genome lacks the terminal inverted repeats found in Mavirus . The two genomes encode about the same number of genes ( 20 CDSs in Mavirus and 21 CDSs in Sputnik ) , but have different coding densities ( 80 . 0 % Sputnik , 92 . 6 % for Mavirus ) . The finding that the shorter Sputnik genome with larger intergenic regions encodes more genes than the longer and gene - denser Mavirus genome can be explained by a difference in the average gene length ( 692 nt for Sputnik and 883 nt in Mavirus ) . The coding content of the two virophages differs significantly , as shown in Fig . 4 . 7 . Only five genes are homologous between Mavirus and Sputnik , and even those genes exhibit low sequence conservation ( Table 4 . 5 ) . The Mavirus capsid protein is related to the Sputnik capsid protein ( Fig . 4 . 8 ) , which is predicted to adopt the same double jelly - roll fold found in other viruses of the PRD1 - adenovirus lineage [ 104 , 123 ] . The jelly - roll capsid gene is a so - called viral hallmark gene ( VHG ) , because it is found in a wide range of different viruses [ 48 ] .

The latter is so divergent in the two virophages that primary sequence homology has been largely eradicated . Furthermore , the S3H domain in Sputnik is linked to an N - terminal primase domain , whereas in Mavirus , the S3H domain is not associated with a primase and precedes a C - terminal domain of unknown function ( Fig . 4 . 7 ) . Two additional proteins shared by Mavirus and Sputnik are an adenovirus - type cysteine protease and a short Sputnik protein with a zinc ribbon motif , which is similar to a predicted GIY - YIG endonuclease in Mavirus . The remaining 16 proteins in Sputnik show no sequence similarity to any Mavirus CDSs . Interestingly , although both virophages encode an integrase , these genes belong to different families . Unlike the retroviral integrase found in Mavirus , Sputnik encodes a tyrosine recombinase - family integrase that is similar to archaeal viruses [ 31 ] . Whether integrase function is essential for virophage replication remains to be determined . Integrases could ensure long - term survival of the virophage by catalyzing integration of the viral genome into host cell or host virus chromosomes , which would physically link the virophage genome with one of the two organisms that it depends on for replication . The finding that about 80 % of Mavirus and Sputnik CDSs appear unrelated argues against a close relationship between the two virophages and suggests that any evolutionary connection between these viruses must be ancient . Alternatively , virophage genomes may experience accelerated mutation rates or exchange genes frequently with cells and other viruses . 120 4 . 3 . 4 Mavirus is related to Maverick / Polinton DNA transposons Surprisingly , the Mavirus genome is closely related to a class of eukaryotic DNA transposons . Transposable elements ( TEs ) can be divided into retrotransposons ( class 1 TEs ) and DNA transposons ( class 2 TEs ) . DNA transposons are further categorized into cut - and - paste TEs , rolling - circle TEs , and the self - synthesizing Maverick or Polinton TEs ( [ 258 ] and references therein ) . MP TEs are 9 - 22 kbp long , encode up to 20 proteins , and are found in a wide range of eukaryotes , including protists , fungi , and animals [ 253 , 259 , 260 ] . Their coding capacity varies among species , yet a conserved set of MP genes has been identified [ 253 , 259 ] . Most MP TEs encode a retroviral integrase , a viral protein - primed DNA polymerase B , an ATPase similar to the FtsK - HerA genome packaging ATPases of dsDNA viruses , and a cysteine protease with homologues in adenoviruses . Another protein termed PY , which is frequently encountered in MP TEs [ 259 ] , shows structural similarity to the MCP of phycodnaviruses [ 122 ] . Because MP TEs genetically resemble viruses of the bacteriophage PRD1 - adenovirus lineage [ 123 ] , a viral origin of these TEs has been proposed [ 122 , 253 ] , although viruses were not known to encode a retroviral integrase in combination with the PRD1 - adenoviral genes found in MP TEs . Homologues of seven Mavirus CDSs are frequently or occasionally encoded by MP TEs ( Fig . 4 . 1A ) . MV02 belongs to the retroviral integrase family , which contains integrases from retroelements and the eukaryotic c - integrases [ 248 ] . Shortly after their discovery , c - integrases were found to be one of the most conserved genes in MP TEs [ 253 , 259 , 261 ] . MP - encoded c - integrases are the closest relatives to Mavirus protein MV02 ( Fig . 4 . 9 ) . Another highly conserved MP gene is the protein - primed DNA polymerase B found in Mavirus MV03 ( Fig . 4 . 3 ) . Two additional genes , the packaging ATPase ( MV15 ) and cysteine protease ( MV16 ) , are frequently encountered in MP TEs [ 253 , 259 ] ( Figs 4 . 5 , 4 . 6 ) . The capsid protein of Mavirus ( MV18 ) is predicted to adopt a secondary structure similar to that of the PY proteins encoded by MP TEs ( Fig . 4 . 8b ) . Lastly , the superfamily III helicase and MV19 with its C - terminal B . bacteriovorus domain are also occasionally encoded by MP TEs . Not only do Mavirus and MP TEs encode similar genes , but a truncated MP - like element in the genome of the slime mould Polysphondylium pallidum shows partial synteny to the Mavirus genome ( Fig . 4 . 10 ) . The syntenic region comprises Mavirus CDSs MV01 - MV03 and the rve - INT and DNA polymerase B proteins encoded by P . pallidum represent the closest homologues of the respective Mavirus proteins ( Figs . 4 . 3 , 4 . 9 , Table 4 . 3 ) . In addition to the three syntenic genes , the MP - like element in P . pallidum includes a predicted cysteine protease and an FtsK - HerA ATPase - like protein ( Fig . 4 . 10 ) . This strongly implies that the P . pallidum MP - like element and the Mavirus virophage are genetically related . Furthermore , Mavirus and MP TEs have 121 Figure 4 . 9 Phylogenetic position of the Mavirus retroviral integrase .

Arrows mark the signature conserved amino acids that define the DDE motif [ 262 ] .

AcMNPV , Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus ; REV , reticuloendotheliosis virus . 122 similar genome lengths ( 19 kb and 15 - 20 kb , respectively ) and genome structures . MP TEs have terminal - inverted repeats of several hundred nucleotides in length and highly conserved ends that start with 5 ' - AG and end with CT - 3 ' [ 259 ] . Similarly , cutting the circular genome of Mavirus between nucleotides 19 , 063 and 1 ( Fig . 4 . 1B ) would result in a linear DNA molecule with 5 ' - AG and CT - 3 ' termini , as well as 50 bp terminal - inverted repeats . 4 . 3 . 5 Viral transposogenesis of Maverick / Polinton DNA transposons The observed parallels in genome length , genome structure , and gene content to MP TEs in general , as well as the sequence similarity and partial synteny to the MP - like element in P . pallidum in particular , imply that the Mavirus virophage and DNA transposons of the MP TEs class have evolved from a common ancestor . The genetic similarities of MP TEs and dsDNA viruses have already spawned various evolutionary hypotheses . It has been suggested that these transposons may have evolved from a linear plasmid [ 259 ] , whereas others proposed that MP TEs and viruses of the PRD1 - adenovirus lineage have evolved from a common ancestral virus [ 122 , 253 ] . Even the origin of the NCLDVs has been linked to MP transposons [ 263 ] . Although one can envision a number of scenarios that would explain the genetic homology between Mavirus and MP TEs , two that would appear to be most likely candidates are that Mavirus was derived from an escaped TE , or that MP TEs arose from the endogenization of an ancient relative of Mavirus . The first scenario is problematic because it requires multiple gene capture events by MP TEs from various sources . For example , the integrase would have to be acquired from a retroelement , whereas the cysteine protease and FtsK - HerA - like ATPase would have originated in a DNA virus . In addition , the first scenario fails to explain the genetic ( Figs . 4 . 5 - 4 . 8 , Table 4 . 5 ) and phenotypic similarities between Mavirus and Sputnik , as well as the dependency of Mavirus on CroV . A more parsimonious explanation is that a Mavirus ancestor ( MVA ) gave rise to MP TEs . This may have occurred in an early eukaryote susceptible to infection by a large DNA virus ( LDNAV ) that coevolved with the MVA ( Fig . 4 . 11 ) . MVA replicated by parasitizing the virion factory of LDNAV and interfered with its propagation , much as occurs in the CroV - Mavirus and Mimivirus - Sputnik systems . The interference of MVA with LDNAV replication led to increased survival of the host - cell population , and selection on the host cell to stabilize the relationship with MVA . In turn , the dependence of MVA on LDNAV replication provided strong selection for MVA to be closely associated with the LDNAV host . The fortuitous acquisition of an integrase gene by MVA provided a mechanism for integration into the cellular genome , which may have conferred protection against infection by LDNAV , and selective pressure for MVA to spread throughout the host - cell population . Selection for this viral defence system in early eukaryotes and repeated endogenization of various virophages in 123 different eukaryotic lineages , combined with accumulation of mutations , intragenomic expansion , and partial or complete loss of the provirophage in some lineages may have led to the current diversity and widespread , albeit patchy , taxonomic distribution of MP DNA transposons ( Fig . 4 . 11 ) [ 253 , 259 ] . In addition to their genetic similarities , the evolutionary relationship between Mavirus and MP TEs is supported by several other observations . First , the integrases of Mavirus and MP TEs are closely related , suggesting that an ancestor of the Mavirus integrase could have catalyzed the insertion of DNA into a eukaryotic genome . However , no endogenous forms of Mavirus in uninfected C . roenbergensis could be detected by polymerase chain reaction with Mavirus - specific primers . Second , Mavirus , as its ancestors presumably did , uses clathrin - mediated endocytosis to enter the host cell independently of its host virus , as shown by thin - section electron microscopy ( see section 5 . 3 . 7 ) . This suggests that Mavirus can associate with the host cell even in the absence of a host virus . Third , the presence of capsid - like proteins and other Mavirus - related genes in MP TEs is consistent with their introduction through an ancient Mavirus . Alternatively , there would have to be multiple gene capture events by MP TEs from viral sources , which is much less parsimonious . Finally , Mavirus interferes with CroV propagation and increases the survival of the host - cell population ( Table 4 . 1 ) ; hence , eukaryotes that are susceptible to infection by giant viruses will gain a selective advantage if they can associate themselves with virophages . The directionality of the proposed viral transposogenesis is also supported by the shared promoter motif of Mavirus and CroV . It is hard to envision a mechanism that would have led to the de novo development from a transposon to the observed host - virus dependence , while it is conceivable that the promoter sequence degenerated after a MVA integrated into the host cell genome . Figure 4 . 10 Syntenic regions of Mavirus and an MP - like element from Polysphondylium pallidum . 124 Figure 4 . 11 Hypothesis for the origin of the Maverick / Polinton class of DNA transposons . ( 1 ) The infection cycle of a lytic large DNA virus ( LDNAV ) . After virus entry , the virion factory ( VF ) produces progeny virions that are released during cell lysis . ( 2 ) A virophage ( the Mavirus ancestor , MVA ) is dependent on co - infection with the LDNAV and negatively affects its lytic infection cycle . The survival rate of the eukaryotic host population is increased by the MVA . ( 3 ) Using its integrase , the MVA inserts its genome into the host cell chromosome . ( 4 ) Over millions of years , the provirophage is vertically transmitted , accumulates mutations , expands horizontally in some eukaryotic lineages ( e . g . Trichomonas vaginalis [ 252 ] ) , or suffers partial or complete loss in other lineages ( e . g . Ascomycota [ 259 ] ) . ( 5 ) These evolutionary processes are complemented by repeated endogenization of Mavirus - like virophages and result in the observed distribution and diversity of MP TEs . ( 6 ) Of presumably multiple ancient lineages of virophages , only the one from which Mavirus descended gave rise to the MP TEs . The Sputnik virophage has probably evolved from a different lineage , and many others may remain to be discovered . 125 4 . 4 Conclusions Virophages are a novel group of satellite viruses with only two representatives isolated thus far . Sputnik and Mavirus parasitize the two largest and most complex viruses known , Mimivirus and CroV . Although Sputnik and Mavirus cause similar phenotypes and have genomes of similar size , they differ in their genetic content . It has been proposed that Sputnik could have descended from a mobile element [ 264 ] ; in contrast , genetic homology implies that an ancestor of the Mavirus virophage gave rise to DNA transposons of the Maverick / Polinton class . In this scenario , ancestral forms of Mavirus provided protection to host cells against infection by lytic viruses and were endogenized by the host cells , leading to MP TEs becoming dispersed and fixed within the genomes of many eukaryotic lineages . Although it is not possible to reconstruct these early evolutionary events , the viral transposogenesis hypothesis generates several testable predictions , e . g . whether a virophage can integrate into a eukaryotic genome and whether the resulting provirophage could be induced through superinfection by a host virus . Already , virophages have changed the textbook view of viruses , showing that the largest representatives of the virus world can be parasitized themselves [ 265 ] . Through their association with giant viruses and the mosaic nature of their genes , virophages could mediate horizontal gene transfer between giant viruses [ 31 ] . The discovery of new virophages will undoubtedly shed further light on the fascinating lifestyle and the evolutionary relationships of these novel superparasites and other forms of mobile genetic elements . In the light of recently described endogenous viruses [ 266 ] , the discovery of Mavirus reveals a further facet of the intricate genetic interactions between viruses and cellular life . 126 5 Ultrastructural Characterization of CroV and Mavirus Infection 5 . 1 Synopsis Thin - section transmission electron microscopy was used to shed light on ultrastructural aspects of CroV and Mavirus replication in Cafeteria roenbergensis . The early stages of CroV infection were characterized by cytoplasmic CroV cores that were membrane - bound and coated with fibres . These cores transformed into early virion factories ( VFs ) , which then grew significantly in size . Mature , capsid - producing CroV VFs developed between 6 h and 12 h post infection ( p . i . ) and at 18 h p . i . , the cytoplasm of infected cells was filled with progeny virions . CroV capsids were assembled at the periphery of the VF and the genome was packaged into preformed capsid structures . Large clusters of ribosome - like aggregates were more frequent in infected cells than in uninfected cells and may support viral protein synthesis . The burst size of CroV was estimated to be around 100 virions per cell . The Mavirus virophage entered C . roenbergensis cells via clathrin - mediated endocytosis and appeared to replicate within the CroV VF , where Mavirus particles were most frequently observed . Progeny virophage particles formed large paracrystalline arrays in the cytoplasm . Putative abnormal CroV capsid structures were often observed in Mavirus - infected cells . The host cell nucleus remained intact until late infection stages and virus particles were never observed within the nucleus , suggesting that CroV and Mavirus replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm . This study represents the first detailed ultrastructural characterization of the CroV infection cycle and of the intracellular events of a virophage infection . Furthermore , these observations corroborate the classification of Mavirus as a virophage of CroV . 5 . 2 Materials and methods 5 . 2 . 1 Transmission electron microscopy Exponentially growing C . roenbergensis cultures in 250 - 500 ml modified f / 2 enriched sea water medium ( see section 2 . 2 . 1 ) ( total volume 6 l ) were infected with Mavirus - containing CroV lysate at an multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of ~ 0 . 3 ( 300 µl of 5x10 7 CroV ml - 1 - containing lysate were added to 500 ml of 1x10 5 cells ml - 1 ) . Duplicate aliquots of 380 ml were taken from infected cultures at different time points ( 0 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 h post infection ) as well as from uninfected 127 control cultures at 0 h and 24 h p . i . . Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 5 , 000 x g in a Sorvall RC - 5C centrifuge ( GSA rotor , 20°C ) . The supernatant was discarded , cell pellets were suspended in 0 . 5 ml f / 2 medium and centrifuged for 5 min at 3 , 000 g in an Eppendorf 5810 centrifuge . Pellets were suspended in 10 - 15 µl f / 2 sea water medium supplemented with 20 % ( w / v ) BSA by stirring with a pipette tip . Cell suspensions were immediately cryo - preserved using a Leica EM HPM100 high pressure freezer . Vitrified samples were freeze - substituted in a Leica AFS system for 2 days at - 85°C in a 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde 0 . 1 % tannic acid solution in acetone , then rinsed 10X in 100 % acetone at - 85°C , and transferred to 1 % osmium tetroxide , 0 . 1 % uranyl acetate in acetone for an additional 2 days at - 85°C . The samples were then warmed to - 20°C over approximately 10 hours , held at - 20°C for 6 hours to facilitate osmication , and then warmed to 4°C over approximately 12 hours . The samples were then rinsed in 100 % acetone 3X at room temp , and gradually infiltrated with Spurr’s low viscosity embedding media . Samples were polymerized in a 60°C oven overnight . 30 - 50 nm thin sections and 200 - 300 nm semi - thin sections for tomography were obtained using a Reichert Ultracut E ultramicrotome and a Drukker diamond knife . The 30 - 50 nm sections were stained for 12 min in 2 % aqueous uranyl acetate and 6 min in Reynold’s lead citrate . Staining times for the 200 - 300 nm sections were increased to 30 min and 15 min respectively . Image data were recorded on an FEI Tecnai G2 20 TWIN transmission electron microscope at 80 kV for the 30 - 50 nm sections and 200 kV for the 200 - 300 nm sections . Thin sections in figures of this chapter were 30 - 50 nm thick unless stated otherwise . Adobe Photoshop v7 . 0 was used to compile the TEM images . Adjustments to contrast and brightness levels were applied equally to all parts of the image . 5 . 2 . 2 Estimation of burst size The burst size was estimated by counting the number of virus particles in 300 nm thin sections of visibly infected cells at 18 h p . i . and 24 h p . i . and extrapolating the counts to the entire cell volume . The cell volume was estimated by assuming that the shape of Cafeteria cells can be approximated by a sphere . For each visibly infected cell , the number of virus particles was counted and cell dimensions were measured at the lowest and largest diameters , resulting in an average cell radius . The thin sections had a thickness of 300 nm , but a correction for calculating the volume of the section was necessary in order to account for virus particles that were only partially visible . Assuming a maximum particle size of 300 nm for CroV , half a virion diameter was added to the top and bottom of the slice , which resulted in a corrected slice thickness of 600 nm . 128 5 . 3 Results and discussion 5 . 3 . 1 Ultrastructure of Cafeteria roenbergensis The phagotrophic nanoflagellate C . roenbergensis Fenchel & Patterson is a single - celled eukaryote in the kingdom Chromista ( Stramenopiles ) [ 136 ] . The 3 - 6 µm diameter cells are kidney shaped and possess two flagella , one anterior and one posterior flagellum . The anterior flagellum is covered bilaterally by tripartite tubular hairs . The flagella emerge from the ventral side of the cell and are anchored by three microtubular roots that also form part of the feeding apparatus [ 267 ] . During feeding , the posterior flagellum is attached to a substrate , while the anterior flagellum beats to create a current that directs potential prey items towards the cell . In swimming mode , the anterior flagellum beats and pulls the cell forward . Figure 5 . 1 shows the fine structure of a C . roenbergensis strain E4 - 10 cell . The ovoid nucleus is usually located in the centre and is associated with one of the two basal bodies at the flagellar base ( Fig . 5 . 1A , E ) . C . roenbergensis contains three or more mitochondria with tubular cristae , as is typical for Stramenopiles . The Golgi apparatus is situated at the ventral side ( defined by the flagellar apparatus ) of the cell ( Fig . 5 . 1A , C ) . The posterior end often contains phagocytic vacuoles containing ingested bacterial prey ( Fig . 5 . 1A , D ) . A rather unusual feature of Cafeteria is the presence of extrusomes , which are bottle - shaped vesicles 100 - 200 nm in diameter that deliver their electron - dense contents to the cell exterior [ 136 , 267 ] . However , extrusomes were rarely observed in C . roenbergensis strain E4 - 10 . Figure 5 . 1 Ultrastructure of Cafeteria roenbergensis strain E4 - 10 ( next page ) . ( A ) Thin section of a C . roenbergensis cell , strain E4 - 10 .

Scale bar = 500 nm . 129 Figure 5 . 1 Ultrastructure of Cafeteria roenbergensis strain E4 - 10 . 130 5 . 3 . 2 CroV cell entry and uncoating The ultrastructural phenotype of C . roenbergensis cells infected with CroV and Mavirus was studied by thin - section transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . Exponentially growing cultures were infected with a lysate ( labelled " 25 . 10 . 07 B " ) containing approximately 5x10 7 CroV ml - 1 and an unknown concentration of Mavirus . The low CroV MOI of ~ 0 . 3 was chosen because higher MOIs had frequently led to unproductive infections and premature cell death . Whether this effect was due to the presence of the virophage or the " lysis from without " phenomenon during which too many penetration events can lead to severe damage of the cytoplasma membrane [ 209 , 210 ] , is not known . Probably as a direct consequence of the low MOI used , no penetration and virus entry events of CroV were observed . A possible endocytic mode of entry for CroV is discussed in section 5 . 3 . 3 . The first sign of CroV in infected cells was the occurrence of round cytoplasmic objects that had an electron - dense core with a diameter of 160 nm ( ± 28 nm , n = 21 ) . As shown in Figure 5 . 2 , the cores were membrane - bound and surrounded by a ~ 70 nm thick layer of fibres . These structures were observed in all infected samples , starting at 0 h p . i . , but were not present in uninfected cells . Furthermore , the electron - dense centre corresponded in its dimensions to the core of mature CroV virions ( 170 nm ± 17 nm , n = 43 ) . It can therefore be assumed that these particles represent CroV cores . None of the cores were associated with a viral capsid , suggesting either that the capsid did not enter the cell during penetration and core delivery , or that the capsids are unstable after uncoating . Some cells displayed more than one CroV core ( Fig . 5 . 2B ) ; superinfection by several CroV virions is therefore possible . This is similar to findings from Mimivirus , where multiple cores were found to seed independent virion factories ( VFs ) , which may fuse during late infection [ 54 , 67 ] . The chemical nature of the fibres that surrounded the CroV cores is unknown ; however , given that CroV packages a large arsenal of transcription proteins and is likely to transcribe its early genes inside the core upon penetration ( see section 3 . 3 . 3 ) , these fibres may consist of viral mRNA exiting the core through membrane pores . The electron - dense material inside the CroV cores , presumably the viral genome , sometimes displayed a uniform density ( e . g . Fig . 5 . 2B , C ) , but most of the cores seemed only partially filled ( Fig . 5 . 2D - N ) . In some cases , only the surrounding layer of fibrils was still visible ( Fig . 5 . 2O ) , which may be an intermediate stage in the transition to early VFs ( Fig . 5 . 2P ) . 131 Figure 5 . 2 Cytoplasmic CroV cores during early infection . ( A ) Cross section of a C . roenbergensis cell featuring a fibre - coated CroV core ( arrow ) . Scale bar = 500 nm . ( B - P ) Various morphologies of CroV cores . The core membrane , from which the dense fibres seem to protrude , was visible in some cases ( marked by arrow heads ) . Dark dots surrounding the viral cores are free ribosomes . The transition from viral core to early VF is shown in ( N - P ) , as the electron - dense centre material disappeared and the surrounding layer of fibres adopted a ball - like structure . These structures were not observed in uninfected cells . Scale bars = 200 nm . 132 5 . 3 . 3 The CroV virion factory The virion factory ( VF , also called virus factory ) is a specialized cytoplasmic compartment that is generated by viruses to replicate their genomes and assemble their virus particles [ 268 ] . VFs often recruit ribosomes and mitochondria in their vicinity to supply the VF with proteins , ATP , and other essential substrates [ 82 ] . Large DNA viruses such as the NCLDVs are known to build the largest and most spectacular VFs [ 67 , 268 , 269 ] . During viral infection , the VF expands significantly until it eventually fills most of the cell volume . In CroV - infected cells , VFs at different maturation stages could be observed ( Fig . 5 . 3 ) . Early VFs were sometimes difficult to identify , especially at lower magnification , due to the lack of contrasting features such as electron - dense virions surrounding them . However , the filamentous ultrastructure of VFs at higher magnification was very similar to the outer fibrous layer of early CroV cores and was clearly distinguishable from the surrounding cytoplasm , which had a more granular appearance due to the presence of free ribosomes ( Fig . 5 . 3A ) . Only VFs that had grown to approximately 1 µm in diameter or larger were found to produce capsid structures and progeny virions ( Fig . 5 . 3C , D ) . Virus - like particles ( VLPs ) were first observed in 12 h p . i . samples , but not in 6 h p . i . samples . This suggests that CroV assembly starts between 6 h and 12 h p . i . and confirms results from microarray and gene promoter analyses , which revealed that CDSs encoding structural proteins were associated with a later promoter element and were first transcribed at 6 h p . i . ( see sections 2 . 3 . 10 and 2 . 3 . 11 ) . Higher magnification of mature VFs revealed that capsid structures were assembled at the periphery of the VF , where they were prefabricated prior to genome packaging . Examples of CroV capsids at different assembly stages are shown in Fig . 5 . 4 . Capsid fabrication starts with the assembly of one particular face or vertex of the icosahedral particle ( arrow heads in Fig . 5 . 4A ) , which moves away from the VF as polymerization progresses ( arrows in Fig . 5 . 4A ) . Nascent capsids appeared to be lined with a second , inner layer ( arrow head in Fig . 5 . 4B ) , possibly a lipid membrane that could be attached to the capsid structure via transmembrane protein interaction ( see section 3 . 3 . 2 ) . Structurally complete , but empty capsids were frequently observed along the VF periphery ( arrows in Figs . 5 . 4C and 5 . 5A ) , although a few cases were documented where intact , yet empty or only partially filled capsids were detached from the VF and enclosed in a vesicle ( Fig . 5 . 5B , C ) . It is possible that these cases represent endocytic vesicles containing remnants of the virion which infected the cell . This would imply that CroV enters C . roenbergensis cells via endocytosis and that the viral core is released into the cytoplasm with the capsid structure remaining in the endocytic vesicle . Because the cross - sections in Fig . 5 . 5B and C show structurally intact capsids , it is likely that the capsid opening occurs at one particular site , perhaps at a unique vertex similar to the stargate opening in Mimivirus [ 66 ] . 133 Figure 5 . 3 Different stages during expansion of the CroV virion factory .

Symbols : M , mitochondrion ; RA , ribosome aggregates ; VF , virion factory . Packaging of the viral genome occurs after capsid assembly , as electron - dense matter was only found in visually intact capsids . Figure 5 . 6A shows VF - associated CroV particles with heterogeneous core densities , indicating different stages of genome packaging . Capsid filling may occur in two distinct stages , because two distinguishable levels of core densities were observed . The immature particle on the left in Fig . 5 . 6B ( arrow ) represents the first stage , exhibiting a uniform core density that was higher than that of the surrounding cytoplasm , but lower than that of the mature virion on the right . The second stage is shown in Fig . 5 . 6C , where highly dense material is injected on top of the lesser dense material already present in the capsid . It is unclear whether DNA and proteins are packaged simultaneously or successively . 136 Figure 5 . 6 Ultrastructural details of CroV particle filling . ( A ) CroV particles attached to the VF displaying various stages of genome packaging . Single ribosomes within the VF are marked by arrowheads . Scale bar = 500 nm . ( B ) Two virions illustrating the two successive stages of capsid filling . The particle on the left has a lower core density than the mature virion on the right .

The capsids are filled through openings that are located at a vertex ( arrow ) or at a capsid face ( arrowhead ) . Scale bar = 200 nm . ( D ) A completely packed virion is still attached to the VF ( arrow ) . Scale bar = 100 nm . The final stage of virion production is shown in Fig . 5 . 6D , which displays a particle with the uniformly dark core typical of mature virions ; however , this capsid was still attached to the VF by a thin thread ( arrow ) . Most capsids were filled through a vertex of the capsid ( arrows in Fig . 5 . 6B - D ) , only rarely was the opening located at the face of a capsid ( arrowhead in Fig . 5 . 6C ) . 137 5 . 3 . 4 The CroV virion and cell lysis Mature intracellular CroV virions were 220 - 280 nm in diameter and pentagonal or hexagonal in cross - section , confirming previous assumptions of icosahedral symmetry [ 101 ] . It is known that virions of large DNA viruses tend to shrink by 16 - 24 % during sample preparation for thin sectioning [ 36 ] . Assuming an average diameter of 250 nm for CroV capsids in TEM thin sections and an average shrinkage of 20 % , the true diameter of the CroV virion may be ~ 300 nm . Whereas partially assembled or empty capsids appeared mostly intact and symmetrical , mature virions with electron - dense cores were often deformed and squished ( e . g . Fig . 5 . 5B , dense particle on the right ) . This might be an artefact of sample preparation , as pressurized mature virions are probably more susceptible to osmotic damage than empty capsids . A selection of intact mature cytoplasmic virions is presented in Fig . 5 . 7 . The outer capsid layer was clearly discernible in all particles ( marked by arrows in Fig . 5 . 7C - E ) , whereas lipid layers were not always visible ( e . g . Fig . 5 . 7A ) . The CroV capsid probably contains two internal lipid membranes , one directly beneath the capsid layer and a second one surrounding the genome - containing dense core ( arrowheads in Fig . 5 . 7C - E ) . The presence of lipids was also suggested by a loss of infectivity after chloroform treatment , as reported by Garza and Suttle [ 101 ] . Some TEM images suggest that CroV virions may have two unique , opposing vertices . These vertices ( marked by asterisks in Fig . 5 . 7C , E ) were slightly elongated compared to other vertices , which resulted in an increased intermembrane space underneath these vertices . Unique vertex structures have been described in PBCV - 1 and Mimivirus , and are likely to facilitate genome release in these viruses [ 62 , 270 ] . However , cryo - electron microscopy of CroV particles would be a better suited method to investigate such a detailed ultrastructural feature . Newly synthesized virions accumulated in the cytoplasm until cells lysed . No events of virions budding from the host plasma membrane were observed . Some cells were almost entirely filled with virus particles , such as the 24 h p . i . cell in Fig . 5 . 8A . The plasma membrane of this cell may have just started to lyse ( arrow ) . A lysed cell containing only a few remaining mitochondria and VLPs is shown in Fig . 5 . 8B . Cell lysis events were rare in TEM thins sections , as these cells were probably not very stable and may have disintegrated during sample preparation . 138 Figure 5 . 7 Mature intracellular CroV virions .

Symbols : M , mitochondrion ; RA , ribosome aggregates . 5 . 3 . 5 CroV infection may be supported by ribosome aggregates Viruses have evolved many ways to orchestrate the host translation system for the purpose of viral protein synthesis [ 162 ] . Large DNA viruses such as the NCLDVs sometimes encode their own translation initiation and elongation factors , which may be used to gain additional control over host translation ( see section 2 . 3 . 2 ) . Poxviruses and African swine fever virus ( ASFV ) build large VFs in the cytoplasm , which are surrounded by mitochondria for ATP supply and often contain membranous material , ribosomes and other translation machinery to facilitate viral protein synthesis and virion assembly . Experiments in vaccinia virus have shown that host translation factors and ribosomes are relocated from the cytoplasm to the VF [ 269 ] . Similar reports from ASFV indicate that host translation factors are actively redistributed by the virus inside and near the VF [ 271 ] . Viruses therefore actively recruit the host translation machinery to the site of viral mRNA production , rather than transporting transcripts to the ribosomes and the resulting proteins back to the VF . The CroV VF seemed largely exclusive to ribosomes ( note the few ribosome particles marked by arrowheads in Fig . 5 . 6A ) , but the periphery of VFs frequently contained free ribosomes ( e . g . 140 Figure 5 . 9 Ribosome aggregates in C . roenbergensis . ( A ) Cell displaying a fibrous CroV core ( arrow ) , mitochondria ( M ) and a large cluster of ribosome aggregates ( boxed area ) . Individual ribosome aggregates are also present ( arrowheads ) .

( C ) Ribosome aggregates from a different cell . This particular cluster had a diameter of ~ 1 . 5 µm . Scale bar = 200 nm ( D ) Close - up view of ribosome aggregates from an uninfected cell . Scale bar = 200 nm . Fig . 5 . 6A ) . Interestingly , CroV - infected cells often displayed large cytoplasmic structures that resembled rosette - like aggregates of non - ER - associated ribosomes ( Fig . 5 . 9 ) . These aggregates had a diameter that varied from 60 nm to 250 nm and consisted of 20 - 25 nm large 141 granules , which corresponded in size and appearance to free ribosomes . It can therefore be assumed that these structures are composed of ribosomes and I will henceforth refer to them as ribosome aggregates . Although individual rosettes of ribosome aggregates were sometimes visible ( arrowheads in Fig . 5 . 9A ) , they mostly occurred clustered in specific cellular locations ( boxed area in Fig . 5 . 9A ) . No literature has been found that described similar structures . It is possible that cryofixation may preserve these structures better than glutaraldehyde fixation ; the latter method was used for previous studies of Cafeteria fine structure [ 136 ] . Whereas only few uninfected cells displayed ribosome aggregates ( Fig . 5 . 9D ) , they were generally more frequent and also larger in infected cells ( Fig . 5 . 9B , C ) . The largest clusters of ribosome aggregates were observed during late infection , when cells contained mature , virion - producing VFs ( Figs . 5 . 3C , 5 . 5A ) . In cells at very late infection stages , these clusters were often the only remaining host structures ( Fig . 5 . 8 A ) . Although further experiments will be necessary to elucidate this novel subcellular structure , the preliminary TEM data suggests that large clusters of ribosomes may serve as production sites for viral proteins outside the VF . 5 . 3 . 6 CroV burst size The burst size can be estimated as the average number of viral particles in visibly infected cells [ 272 ] . In thin sections , these counts have to be extrapolated to the entire cell volume , which poses additional problems if the cell shape is irregular or if organelles remain in the cell , which reduces the volume available to virions . In order to estimate the CroV burst size in C . roenbergensis , 22 images of visibly infected cells at 18 h p . i . and 24 h p . i . were analyzed . The number of VLPs in these 300 nm - thick sections ranged from 14 to 62 with an average of 30 . 3 ± 11 . 7 . Extrapolated to the entire cell volume , which was approximated to be spherical , the burst size of CroV in these cells ranged from 49 to 311 , with an average of 135 ± 62 particles per cell . Although this number is only a rough approximation , it shows clearly that the burst size of this giant virus is on the order of a hundred to a few hundred particles , rather than thousands . For comparison with other large DNA viruses , PBCV - 1 has a burst size of 200 - 250 infectious units per cell [ 273 ] , Ostreococcus tauri virus 5 has a burst size of ~ 25 [ 274 ] , Heterosigma akashiwo virus 01 has a burst size of ~ 770 [ 275 ] , and the burst size of Mimivirus is estimated to be larger than 300 particles per cell [ 59 ] . 5 . 3 . 7 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis of Mavirus Virophages are a novel type of satellite viruses that replicate within the VF of a giant helper virus and negatively affect the replication of their helper virus , thereby increasing survival of their host cells [ 31 , 105 ] ( see section 1 . 3 ) . A virophage parasitizing CroV was discovered and 142 named Mavirus ( see chapter 4 ) . Mavirus is only the second described virophage ; hence , many aspects of virophage biology are still unknown , including the mechanism of entry . Being dependent upon co - infection by a giant virus for their replication , virophages could also rely on their host virus for gaining entry into the host cell . For Sputnik , it has been hypothesized that interaction with the fibrils of Mamavirus could allow the virophage to " piggyback " its way into the amoeba [ 254 ] . This is not the case for Mavirus , as ~ 60 nm large virions were observed at different stages of endocytosis without apparent involvement of CroV ( Fig . 5 . 10 ) . In 24 h p . i . thin sections , virophage particles were frequently observed attached to the cell surface , usually at a distance of ~ 30 nm from the plasma membrane ( Fig . 5 . 10A ) . This implies that the cell surface , the virion surface , or both may be coated with fibres which could be involved in virophage - cell interaction . Invagination of the plasma membrane at sites of attached virophages was observed , as shown in Fig . 5 . 10B . The inner surface of the invagination appeared thicker and denser than a normal cytoplasma membrane ( arrow ) . These structures had striking resemblance to clathrin - coated pits , which are formed during clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) [ 276 , 277 ] . CME is one of several endocytic pathways by which viruses gain entry into cells [ 278 , 279 ] and is initiated by ligand - receptor interaction between virus and host , which triggers an internalization signal . This signal recruits the scaffold protein clathrin to the plasma membrane and results in the electron - dense coat visible by electron microscopy ( e . g . in Fig . 5 . 10B ) . The clathrin - coated vesicle is then pinched off from the plasma membrane by dynamin , uncoated during its transport to endosomes , fused to endosomes , and finally transformed into a lysosome [ 278 ] . The latter process involves acidification , which often causes the capsid to open and release the viral genome into the cytoplasm . Figure 5 . 10C shows a C . roenbergensis cell with two early CroV cores ( arrow heads ) , multiple Mavirus particles attached to the cell surface , and a vesicle close to the plasma membrane containing a single Mavirus particle ( arrow ) . Higher magnification of this area shows that the vesicle is coated with a 25 - 30 nm thick layer ( Fig . 5 . 10D , arrow ) , as would be expected from CME [ 280 ] . An uncoated Mavirus - containing vesicle from a different cell is shown in Fig . 5 . 10E . These observations strongly suggest that the Mavirus virophage enters C . roenbergensis cells independently of CroV by a CME pathway . It cannot be excluded , however , that Mavirus can only attach to CroV - infected cells , e . g . if CroV infection triggered a biochemical response at the cell surface , which Mavirus could specifically detect . 143 Figure 5 . 10 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis of Mavirus .

This was probably due to a low MOI , and 1 - 2 rounds of Mavirus replication may have been necessary to generate sufficient progeny virions by 24 h p . i . for TEM visualization . Intracellular Mavirus particles were always located in the cytoplasm and never in the nucleus or other organelles . Furthermore , Mavirus particles were consistently found within and around the CroV VF , as shown in Fig . 5 . 11 . The co - infected cell in Fig . 5 . 11A displays a large VF , several mature CroV particles , and Mavirus particles in the centre and along the periphery of the VF ( arrowheads ) . In Fig . 5 . 11B , multiple virophage particles can be seen within the CroV VF . The individual particles had different densities , suggesting that Mavirus genome packaging may occur within the VF . It is therefore likely that replication and assembly of the virophage take place within the CroV VF , corroborating the virophage concept ( see chapter 4 for further arguments ) . The presence of Mavirus in CroV VFs did not seem to directly affect CroV capsid assembly , as shown in Fig . 5 . 11C . However , some cells exhibited large VFs that contained Mavirus particles but no CroV virions ( Figs . 5 . 11D , 5 . 13B ) , with the exception of occasionally observed objects that resembled abnormal CroV capsid structures ( arrows in Fig . 5 . 11A , D ; white arrowhead in Fig . 5 . 13B ) . In these cells , CroV replication may have been delayed or suppressed , a reasonable assumption given the decrease of CroV production observed in co - infected cultures ( see section 4 . 3 . 1 ) . Alternatively , the VF may not have yet started the production of CroV particles , which would imply that the Mavirus infection cycle is shorter than that of CroV . Mavirus has a much smaller genome ( 19 kbp ) than CroV ( 730 kbp ) and may therefore require less time for DNA replication . Similar results have been reported from the Sputnik virophage , which has a shorter replication cycle than its host virus Mimivirus [ 31 ] . Mavirus particles had a hexagonal cross - section which implies icosahedral morphology . With a diameter of ~ 60 nm , they were clearly distinguishable from the much larger CroV virions . Figure 5 . 12 visualizes the size difference between Mavirus and CroV . For comparison , the mitochondria in Fig . 5 . 12A and B are of equal size . In co - infected cells , progeny Mavirus particles tended to form paracrystalline arrays at a peripheral cytoplasmic location ( Fig . 5 . 13A , B ) . Many virions in these paracrystalline arrays had an electron - lucent appearance and may be incompletely packaged particles . 145 Figure 5 . 11 Mavirus particles co - localize with the CroV virion factory .

Scale bars = 200 nm ( C ) , 100 nm ( D , E ) . ( F ) Close - up view of Mavirus virions . The hexagonal capsids contain electron - dense material . Scale bar = 50 nm . Cells that were visibly infected with Mavirus frequently contained 100 - 400 nm large structures that consisted mostly of open circles ( Fig . 5 . 13C , E ) , but closed circles were also observed ( Fig . 5 . 13D ) . They were unilaterally covered with 35 - 70 nm long fibres , similar to the fibres that coat the CroV cores during early infection ( Fig . 5 . 2 ) . These fibres were anchored on a 7 - 9 nm thick electron - dense layer that resembled CroV capsid layers , with the exception that these structures lacked polygonal symmetry . Given that most of these structures were linear , it can be excluded that they are lipid membranes . Electron microscopy of Acanthamoeba cells co - infected with Mamavirus and Sputnik revealed defective Mamavirus capsids in the presence of Sputnik [ 31 ] . Some of these defective structures were elongated , open - ended capsid layers that were unilaterally covered with fibrils . It is therefore possible that the fibrous structures associated with Mavirus infection represent morphologically aberrant forms of CroV . 147 Alternatively , they may represent empty CroV capsids as they bear similarity to empty Mimivirus capsids in phagocytic vacuoles after release of the viral core into the cytoplasm [ 67 ] . They are also similar to virion structures of myxoma virus during stages of uncoating [ 281 ] . Unlike Mimivirus , however , CroV particles are not covered by external fibres and would have to develop these appendages upon contact with the host cytosol . Such a scenario is not impossible , given that even extracellular virion development has been documented in an archaeal virus [ 282 ] . As a further alternative , an outer fibre layer may have already been present in the common ancestor of CroV and Mimivirus , which was then reduced to a rudimentary stage in CroV . Because these structures were mostly observed in Mavirus - containing cells , it seems most likely , however , that they represent aberrant forms of CroV capsids caused by Mavirus co - infection .

Electron microscopy revealed that its intracellular mode of replication is similarly complex . Examination of ultra - thin sections of C . roenbergensis cells at different stages of infection provided the first ultrastructural description of the CroV replication cycle . CroV may enter the cell via endocytosis , as suggested by vesicles containing empty capsids . During the early stage of infection ( starting immediately after inoculation ) , electron - dense CroV cores with a fibrous outer layer were found in the cytoplasm . As the dense core disappeared , the VF started to develop and grow , eventually surpassing the nucleus in size . Production of CroV virions started between 6 h p . i . and 12 h p . i . and entailed the fabrication of icosahedral capsids at the periphery of the VF , followed by a presumably two - stage process of genome packaging . Viral protein synthesis may be sustained by large ribosomal aggregates , a hitherto undescribed phenomenon . Mature virions detached from the VF and accumulated in electron - lucent areas around the VF until particles were released from the cell through lysis . Intact nuclei were observed throughout infection , suggesting that the host genome may not be degraded . These observations are reminiscent of ultrastructural studies in Mimivirus , which also described large cytoplasmic VFs with peripheral virion assembly via preformed capsids , and intact host nuclei during infection [ 67 ] . However , several questions remain unanswered , including the mode of cell entry by CroV . Uptake of the entire virion by endocytosis seems most likely , either via phagocytosis akin to Mimivirus or via receptor - mediated endocytosis . Furthermore , the origin of the internal virion membranes is unclear , as CroV VFs did not appear to be membrane - bound or associated with the host membrane system , a problem also described for Mimivirus [ 67 ] . The intracellular life cycle of CroV resembles that of Mimivirus and other nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses and suggests that CroV replicates exclusively in the host cytoplasm . In addition to presenting the first detailed ultrastructural characterization of CroV infection , this study also provides the first visual description of the Mavirus virophage and is the most detailed report of the intracellular phase of a virophage thus far . Mavirus virions entered C . roenbergensis cells via clathrin - mediated endocytosis , were frequently found within the CroV VF but excluded from the nucleus , and formed paracrystalline arrays in the cytoplasm . Putative abnormal CroV capsid structures and a potential decrease in the number of mature CroV virions were observed in co - infected cells . These observations are in accordance with the recently proposed definition of a virophage , which states that virophages are replication - dependent on a co - infecting large DNA virus and are true parasites of the host virus , rather than the host cell . 150 This definition encompasses the idea that virophages replicate within the VF of the host virus , that they depend on gene products provided by the host virus , and that they decrease the fitness of their host virus as a result of parasitism . 151 6 Concluding Chapter In this dissertation , I presented a thorough characterization of a new giant virus , Cafeteria roenbergensis virus ( CroV ) , and its virus parasite , Mavirus . By combining genomics , transcriptomics , proteomics , and thin - section transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , a coherent picture about the biology of these viruses has started to emerge . Knowledge about genome sequence is the basis and key to further studies of any organism , especially one as small as a virus . Putative protein functions can be derived from a sequenced genome , which allow an assessment of the metabolic capabilities of the organism . Inferences about the evolutionary origin can be made from the analysis of regulatory regions and comparative phylogenetics . Furthermore , sequenced genomes allow the design of additional experiments , such as transcriptomics , proteomics , and characterization of individual gene products with biochemical methods . Such post - genomic studies are absolutely essential in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the biology of an organism . Although genome sequencing and bioinformatic methods are constantly being improved , caution should be exercised when protein functions are predicted on the sole basis of sequence homology . Accumulation of sequence data alone does not necessarily translate into a better understanding of gene function , as pointed out by Galperin and Koonin [ 283 ] . This should be kept in mind when interpreting the results of this dissertation . Despite the wealth of data generated from genome , transcriptome and proteome analyses , any statement about the biological function of a gene product is based on inference from sequence comparison and should be viewed as a prediction . Precautions have been taken to minimize erroneous predictions , e . g . by querying multiple databases , choosing conservative expectation value cutoffs , and identifying conserved protein domains via multiple sequence alignments . The strength of this work lies in the combination of data from different experiments and I hope that this information will be used as a starting point for further exploration of CroV , Mavirus , and related viruses . The following sections integrate and summarize the most important results from chapters 2 - 5 and discuss some important implications arising from the discovery of CroV and Mavirus . 6 . 1 The infection cycles of CroV and Mavirus By combining genomics , thin - section electron microscopy , and temporal gene expression analysis , I was able to reconstruct key events of the CroV and Mavirus infection cycles . The intracellular steps of infection are summarized in Fig . 6 . 1 and outlined in the following sections . 152 Figure 6 . 1 The infection cycles of CroV and Mavirus in C . roenbergensis . 6 . 1 . 1 Before cell entry : the CroV particle The viral particle is crucial for the dissemination of a virus , and analysis of the particle ' s ultrastructure and protein composition can give important clues about the biology and classification of a virus . The design of a viral capsid must meet high standards . In the extracellular milieu , the virion is exposed to harsh environmental conditions such as mechanical stress , UV irradiation , varying osmotic pressure , and reactive oxygen species . Only those viruses will succeed in evolution whose virions are able to protect the viral genome from these harmful conditions and deliver it unscathed to a suitable host cell . The CroV virion is a 220 - 280 nm large icosahedral particle ( as measured by TEM ) , which may possess two unique vertices ( see section 5 . 3 . 4 ) . The capsid is built from the major capsid protein in combination with numerous other proteins , most of which have not yet been identified . Proteomic analyses revealed that at least 129 different virus - encoded proteins constitute the CroV virion . The capsid contains two lipid membranes . The outer membrane may be in close contact with the inner surface of the capsid layer , an interaction that could be mediated by several transmembrane virion proteins ( Table 3 . 1 ) . The inner membrane surrounds the core with a 730 kbp dsDNA 153 genome and an eclectic set of non - structural proteins . Among these proteins are at least six predicted DNA repair enzymes , involved in photoreactivation and base excision repair . CroV was isolated from the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the surface waters at this latitude are exposed to high doses of UV irradiation , hence it can be assumed that the viral DNA suffers considerable photodamage in its natural environment . It remains to be tested whether the packaged DNA repair enzymes are active inside the virion . The CroV particle is one of the most complex known virions , containing an elaborate set of structural and non - structural proteins , as well as a multi - layered internal structure . 6 . 1 . 2 Cell entry of CroV During TEM analysis of infected cells , no case of virus attachment or penetration could be documented . However , vesicle - enclosed empty capsids in the cytoplasm of visibly infected cells suggested that CroV may enter its host by an endocytic pathway ( see section 5 . 3 . 3 ) . Whether CroV is internalized by receptor - mediated endocytosis or phagocytosis remains to be determined . During Mimivirus cell entry , the amoeba ingests the virus particle , the Mimivirus stargate portal opens inside the phagosome , and the outer virion membrane fuses with the phagosomal membrane , releasing the virion core into the cytoplasm ( see section 1 . 2 . 2 ) . CroV , however , lacks the fibrous capsid coating of Mimivirus , which presumably has the effect of mimicking the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial prey and increasing the effective particle diameter to trigger phagocytosis . Hence , receptor - mediated endocytosis seems to be more likely for CroV . Entry of CroV may be facilitated by virion - located oxidoreductases , protein disulfide isomerases , and proteases present in the virion , which could induce conformational changes upon contact with the host cell . 6 . 1 . 3 Early steps in CroV infection The first visible sign of infection was the presence of electron - dense cytoplasmic vesicles that matched CroV cores in diameter and electron density ( see section 5 . 3 . 2 ) . CroV encodes an extensive array of transcription - related proteins and most of this machinery was found to be packaged inside the virus particle ( see section 3 . 3 . 3 ) . The CroV transcription apparatus includes eight RNA polymerase subunits , several transcription factors and helicases , DNA topoisomerase IB , the mRNA capping enzyme and a polymerase for mRNA polyadenylation . In this regard , CroV is similar to poxviruses and Mimivirus , where transcription of early genes takes place inside the virion cores before the genome is released into the host cytoplasm . It is therefore very likely that early transcription of CroV genes operates in a similar manner . According to this scenario , protein components required for transcription are packaged in the 154 virion core and the mRNAs of early genes are 5 ' capped and 3 ' polyadenylated within the confinement of the inner virion membrane . In TEM thin sections , the intracellular core - like vesicles during the early stages of infection were surrounded by a dense layer of fibrous material , which may consist of mRNA emerging from the viral core , targeted for translation in the cytoplasm . Free ribosomes were present throughout the cytoplasm , but were mostly excluded from the virion factory ( VF ) . Rosette - like structures that appeared to consist of aggregated ribosomes were frequently observed in CroV - infected cells , and also , albeit less frequently , in uninfected cells . The literature on C . roenbergensis contained no reference to such observations and it is not clear whether these structures can be induced by CroV . Using microarray analysis , 62 CroV transcripts were detected immediately after infection ( see section 2 . 3 . 10 ) . Some of these transcripts may be packaged inside the virion . The early genes were mostly governed by the " AAAAATTGA " promoter signal , which may be recognized by packaged transcription factors . Thirty - nine of the genes expressed at 0 h p . i . were of unknown function , the remainder included diverse enzymatic functions such as ubiquitin ligases , heat shock proteins , SFII helicases , isoleucyl - tRNA synthetase , histone acetyl transferase , methyltransferases , a protein kinase , a protein phosphatase , and the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase ( RNR ) . It can be assumed that many of these early proteins are involved in virus - host interaction . Between 1 h p . i . and 3 h p . i . , four RNA polymerase subunits , five transcription factors , and the mRNA capping enzyme were expressed . This implies that 1 - 2 hours after the virus enters the cell , the packaged transcription machinery is replaced by newly synthesized components . About 2 - 3 h p . i . , DNA replication genes started to be expressed . This comprised the main processive enzyme DNA polymerase B , which was first expressed at 3 h p . i . , as well as two DNA topoisomerases ( types IA and IIA ) , primase , DNA ligase , three SFII helicases , clamp loader ( PCNA ) , and a replication factor . At the same time , nucleotide metabolism genes were transcribed , including the small subunit of RNR , thymidine kinase , dUTPase , dNMP kinase , and the bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase / thymidylate synthase . These enzymes provide nucleotides for DNA replication . Other genes expressed at 1 - 3 h p . i . include a bacterial Lon protease , a Ser / Thr protein kinase , two ubiquitin ligases and a ubiquitin - specific protease , implying that the host metabolism may now be increasingly targeted by viral proteins . TEM thin sections of 3 h p . i . cells showed no sign of viral infection and VFs were difficult to identify due to their small size and lack of associated capsid structures . 155 6 . 1 . 4 CroV capsid assembly , genome packaging , and cell lysis Between 3 h p . i . and 6 h p . i . , CroV gene expression switches from early stage to late stage . A promoter signal associated with the late stage was found to contain a conserved " TCTA " core motif ( see section 2 . 3 . 11 ) . Structural components were first expressed at 6 h p . i . , including the major capsid protein , capsid protein 2 , the major core protein , and a phage tail collar domain protein . These genes are associated with the TCTA promoter , and their proteins , except for capsid protein 2 , were highly abundant in the virion proteome ( see section 3 . 3 . 2 ) . The predicted DNA packaging ATPase of the FtsK - HerA family was first seen expressed at 6 h p . i . , but was not found to be packaged . Disulfide bond formation in viral proteins is likely to be catalyzed by the suite of CroV - encoded redox proteins , analogous to the ER - independent redox pathway identified in vaccinia virus [ 237 ] . The first visual evidence of virion assembly was found at 12 h p . i . . Production of capsid structures and packaging of the viral genome thus started between 6 h p . i . and 12 h p . i . , which was accompanied by growth of the VF ( see section 5 . 3 . 3 ) . Assembly of CroV capsid structures resembled that of Mimivirus and took place at the periphery of the VF . Single capsid faces appeared first , followed by multi - facet partial capsids and finally complete but empty capsids with pentagonal or hexagonal cross - sections . These empty capsid shells were still attached to the VF when electron - dense material , the viral genome , was injected into the pre - fabricated capsids . Mature virions eventually detached from the VF and accumulated in the cytoplasm until they were released by cell lysis . Many of the events involved in capsid assembly and cell lysis remain unknown . For instance , nothing is known about the origin of the internal virion membranes , as the VF itself does not seem to be membrane - bound . Genome packaging probably involves the previously mentioned FtsK - HerA - like ATPase , but it is unclear whether the DNA is injected through one specific vertex , through one of the capsid faces , or through both as seen in Mimivirus [ 67 ] . Lysis occurred between 12 h p . i . and 18 h p . i . , but the exact timing and the lysis - inducing factors are unknown . In summary , CroV displays a highly complex and unusually autonomous infection cycle , which seems to occur entirely in the cytoplasm and resembles those of Mimivirus and poxviruses . 6 . 1 . 5 The infection cycle of the Mavirus virophage The Mavirus virophage has an icosahedral capsid with a diameter of ~ 60 nm , as measured from TEM thin sections ( Fig . 5 . 12 ) . The existence of an inner membrane is suggested by a Mavirus homologue of the P9 / A32 - like , FtsK - HerA family of DNA pumping ATPases , which are 156 specifically found in dsDNA viruses with an internal lipid layer . The protein composition of the virion remains unknown , with the exception of the major capsid protein ( MV18 ) , which was identified by LC - MS / MS analysis during the proteome experiment ( see section 3 . 3 . 9 ) . TEM thin sections of infected cells demonstrated that the virophage enters C . roenbergensis cells independently of CroV by clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( see section 5 . 3 . 7 ) . Mavirus virions were frequently seen attached to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane and enclosed within coated and uncoated intracellular vesicles ( Fig . 5 . 10 ) . Nothing is known about the eclipse phase , i . e . the events that happen after endocytosis and before new virophage particles appear in the CroV VF . Using quantitative real - time PCR ( qPCR ) , no Mavirus genome replication was observed in cultures inoculated with a virophage preparation that had been filtered through 0 . 1 µm syringe filters to remove CroV particles ( see section 4 . 3 . 1 ) . In contrast , Mavirus did replicate in cells co - infected with CroV . Mavirus replication is therefore dependent on co - infection with CroV . Mavirus encodes a predicted protein - primed DNA polymerase B , and a superfamily 3 helicase was found to be homologous to the principal replicative helicases of other dsDNA viruses . Mavirus could thus be self - sufficient for DNA replication and rather depend on CroV enzymes for gene expression . This would be in accordance with the highly conserved TCTA promoter signal that is located approximately 15 nt upstream of all 20 Mavirus CDSs and is identical to a predicted late promoter motif in CroV . While it cannot be excluded that Mavirus has a nuclear phase in its infection cycle , there is currently no evidence indicating nuclear involvement , and it must be assumed that Mavirus replication and assembly take place in the cytoplasmic VF of CroV . This in turn implies that the only transcription enzymes available to Mavirus are those encoded and packaged by CroV . Preliminary data suggests that early CroV transcription starts inside the virion core , thus any early transcription factors packaged by CroV would not be accessible to a cytoplasmically located virophage genome , unless it were able to penetrate the CroV core . When CroV infection proceeds to the late stage of infection ( around 6 h p . i . ) , the CroV core is transformed into a VF . This suggests that CroV - encoded late transcription factors are more abundant and more widely distributed than early transcription factors , which could explain why Mavirus evolved to incorporate the CroV late promoter motif in its 5 ' upstream regions instead of an early CroV promoter motif . Similar findings from the Mimivirus - Sputnik system lead to the conclusion that virophages in general tend to exploit the late transcription machinery of their host viruses [ 69 ] . Due to the mixed infection system and the presumably low virophage inoculum that was used for the TEM experiment , virophage particles were only found in 24 h p . i . samples , which was the latest sample time point . Mavirus virions were most often found within or around the CroV VF , a 157 further indication that replication and assembly of Mavirus may occur in the CroV VF . Several cells exhibited large crystalline arrays of virophage particles outside the CroV VF , which could represent a form of temporary storage for progeny virophages . In summary , genome , qPCR , and electron microscopy analyses indicate that Mavirus is a virophage of CroV , and that Mavirus replication depends on CroV - encoded enzymes . 6 . 2 CroV genome evolution 6 . 2 . 1 The origin of CroV genes Genomes of large DNA viruses vary greatly in size , from 100 kbp to 1 , 200 kbp . Comparative phylogenomics performed by Iyer and coworkers revealed a core set of ~ 50 genes that is shared by most NCLDVs and was likely present in the NCLDV ancestor [ 49 , 50 , 52 ] . The coding potential of extant NCLDVs is much larger than this core set and ranges from 150 to 981 proteins [ 28 , 69 ] . There are two principal explanations for this discrepancy . On one hand , the NCLDV ancestor could have possessed a relatively small genome , which has been extensively expanded over the course of evolution . On the other hand , if the genome of the NCLDV ancestor was similar in size to those of extant giant viruses , then gene loss , gene replacement , and reductive evolution would be the main driving forces of NCLDV genome evolution . Although gene loss was probably an important factor in shaping at least some of the smaller NCLDV genomes , most researchers favour the former scenario of massive gene acquisition by giant viruses . To circumvent the problem that the majority of NCLDV genes are ORFans and have no homologues in cellular genomes , phylogenetic analyses are often restricted to the smaller proportion of NCLDV genes with homologues in eukaryotes and bacteria [ 84 , 90 ] . This results in a distorted view of NCLDV evolution , because insights gained from these limited analyses cannot be extrapolated to the entire genome of a giant virus [ 284 ] . Alternatively , the existence of viral ORFans is sometimes explained by accelerated viral mutation rates or the poor database coverage of cellular and viral sequences as a result of insufficient gene pool sampling . In contrast to these views , it has been shown that the mutation rates of NCLDV genes are quite comparable to those in eukaryotes [ 165 ] and that the number of viral ORFans does not decrease with increasing sequence information about cellular genomes [ 285 ] . The existence of viral ORFans therefore clearly contradicts the traditional view of viruses as " gene pickpockets " and argues for a more complex scheme to explain the evolution of NCLDVs . CroV is no exception , encoding 277 CDSs that have no significant sequence similarity to proteins in GenBank ( Fig . 2 . 8 ) . 158 However , even the evolutionary origins of viral genes with well - characterized homologues in cellular genomes may be more complicated than they seem at first glance . According to the traditional view , these genes are the result of horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) from a eukaryote or bacterium to the virus . In phylogenetic trees , however , CroV homologues of cellular genes rarely cluster within a particular group of potential eukaryotic host organisms and instead branch frequently between eukaryotic and bacterial groups ( e . g . Figs . 2 . 9 , 2 . 11 , 2 . 18 , 2 . 28 ) . Although it cannot be excluded that methodological problems such as long - branch attraction are responsible for these observations , and although the lack of sequence information about the C . roenbergensis genome represents a significant drawback of this study , my data analysis does not support a scenario of extensive gene acquisition by CroV via HGT from eukaryotic genomes . NCLDVs not only contain well - conserved versions of eukaryotic genes , but also encode a significant number of genes related to bacteria . Giant viruses that infect phagotrophic eukaryotes such as Acanthamoeba or endosymbionts of phagotrophs such as Chlorella sp . ( an endosymbiont of Paramecium bursaria ) were found to have the highest proportion of bacterial genes [ 214 ] . The most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that viruses which infect bacteriovores are frequently exposed to DNA from ingested bacteria and , in the case of strictly cytoplasmic viruses such as Mimivirus , bacterial and viral DNA can share the same intracellular compartment . This led to the notion of amoebae and other phagotrophs as melting pots of evolution , mixing viral , bacterial , and eukaryal genomes [ 39 , 286 ] . Filée and Chandler [ 214 , 287 ] noted that bacterial genes in Mimivirus and some phycodnaviruses occurred in clusters at the genome extremities and that these genes may have been transferred concomitantly . Although located in the middle of the CroV genome , the 38 kbp region of putative bacterial origin represents the most impressive example of large - scale HGT in a giant virus thus far . The exceptional status of this region was corroborated by multiple observations . First , none of the genes in the 38 kbp region are associated with the conserved early or late promoter motifs , which cover the rest of the genome rather uniformly ( Fig . 2 . 5 ) . Second , not a single protein encoded by the 38 kbp region was found to be packaged in the virion ( Fig . 3 . 1 ) . Third , genes in this region have no homologues in Mimivirus , unlike the rest of the genome . And finally , those CDSs in the 38 kbp region with homologues in cellular organisms are predicted carbohydrate metabolism enzymes with predominantly bacterial affiliation ( Table 2 . 5 ) . Although these observations are in favour of a relatively recent acquisition of the 38 kbp genomic segment from a bacterial source , the rest of CroV genes are presumably very ancient , as outlined in the following section . 159 In summary , the analysis of the CroV genome presented in this work did not result in a simple explanation that would account for the puzzling gene composition of CroV . Instead , some parts of the genome seem to have originated from eukaryotic and bacterial genes , and other parts arose by gene duplication ; however , the majority of CroV genes are unique to this virus and their evolutionary origin is unknown . The CroV genome will likely become an integral part of the constantly growing NCLDV data set , and will help to refine our understanding about the origin and evolution of giant viruses . 6 . 2 . 2 Indicators for an ancestral origin of CroV As a member of the NCLDV clade , whose ancestor probably dates back to the origin of the eukaryotic domain about two billion years ago [ 52 ] , CroV is certainly no recently emerged pathogen . These questions can only be addressed through detailed comparative phylogenomics , which are beyond the scope of this work . However , certain pieces of data indicate that CroV may be closer to the NCLDV ancestor than most other viruses in this group . There are two types of DNA ligases found among NCLDVs , the NAD - dependent type and the ATP - dependent type . Their distribution pattern is complementary , i . e . no virus has been found to encode both NAD ligases [ 50 ] . Interestingly , although the ATP - dependent form is more widespread , phylogenetic analysis suggests that the NCLDV ancestor had an NAD - dependent DNA ligase which it may have acquired from a bacteriophage [ 175 ] . During the course of evolution , the NAD - dependent form was replaced on multiple occasions with the ATP - dependent form [ 175 ] . CroV , like Mimivirus , entomopoxviruses and some iridoviruses , encodes an NAD - dependent DNA ligase , hence the ancestral version is most likely still present in these viruses . Another example is the multi - subunit DNA - dependent RNA polymerase encoded by CroV , consisting of at least eight proteins ( see section 2 . 3 . 4 ) . Based on the presence in most NCLDVs of the largest two RNA polymerase subunits ( Fig . 2 . 31 ) , it is thought that the NCLDV ancestor already possessed a complex RNA polymerase and that gene loss in several lineages ( e . g . EhV - 86 is the only phycodnavirus to encode RNA polymerase subunits ) is responsible for the patchy distribution of these genes in extant NCLDVs [ 50 ] . The seemingly complete set of RNA polymerase subunits in CroV thus indicates that this virus has retained much of the genetic complement that is thought to have been present in the NCLDV ancestor . One of the surprising findings of CroV genome analysis was the presence of four intein elements in genes with well - characterized homologues ( see section 2 . 3 . 8 ) . Although inteins are found in all three domains of life , their distribution is sporadic and their evolutionary origins are 160 unknown [ 192 ] . Pietrokovski [ 203 ] proposed that inteins might be as old as the cells in which they are found , and that inteins originally had a beneficial role to the cell , the loss of which caused their slow extinction . Clearly , there is much that we do not understand about intein biology , but if their patchy distribution across eukaryotes , bacteria , and archaea , their high sequence divergence , the absence of inteins in genomes of multicellular organisms , and the ancient origin of the proteins they are found in , are testimony of an early evolutionary origin of inteins , then any organism containing several inteins must be ancient itself [ 203 ] . CroV encodes four inteins , more than any other eukaryotic virus , but only one of them ( DNA polymerase B intein ) is also found in Mimivirus , despite the fact that all four exteins ( i . e . the host proteins in which inteins are inserted ) have close homologues in Mimivirus . One possible explanation is that the CroV inteins colonized their host proteins relatively recently ; a scenario that would suggest that horizontal spread of inteins is a relatively frequent phenomenon . However , this contradicts the common view of intein evolution , which predicts that colonization of empty allelic sites is very rare , especially in asexually reproducing organisms , and that inteins may be slowly going extinct [ 203 ] . The missing homing endonuclease domain in the CroV RNA polymerase II Rpb2 intein and the degenerate endonuclease domains in DNA polymerase and ribonucleotide reductase inteins ( Table 2 . 4 ) also argue against a recent acquisition of this intein . Therefore , the finding of four intein elements in CroV may indicate an ancient origin of this virus genome . 6 . 3 Taxonomic classification Neither CroV nor Mavirus have been assigned yet to an existing viral family . A proposal has been submitted to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ) to create the genus Cafeteriavirus in the family Mimiviridae for the new species Cafeteria roenbergensis virus . The justification for the creation of a new genus states that CroV " has many unique features and is clearly distinct from Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus , the only current member of the Mimiviridae . Although both viruses have very large genomes ( 730 kbp and 1 . 181 kbp ) and share the same early promoter motif as well as many genes that are exclusive to this family , there are substantial differences in coding potential ( 544 vs . 981 protein - coding genes ) , late promoter motifs , genome organization , particle size ( 280 vs . 500 nm ) , and host range ( marine flagellate vs . freshwater amoeba ) . All these observations argue strongly in favor of establishing the new genus Cafeteriavirus within the family Mimiviridae . " As more giant viruses are being discovered which fill in the missing branches of the NCLDV tree , CroV may eventually be classified into its own family . No ICTV proposal has yet been submitted for Mavirus classification . Virophages represent a 161 hitherto unseen type of satellite virus and it is likely that Sputnik and Mavirus will represent their own genera in a family of virophages that is yet to be created . 6 . 4 Limitations and outlooks Elucidation of the CroV genome , transcriptome , and proteome , as well as the discovery of the Mavirus virophage and ultrastructural documentation of the infection cycle of these viruses have significantly expanded the current knowledge about giant viruses and their virophages , and have uncovered a genetic link between virophages and transposable elements . However , despite the wealth of new information gained , many aspects could not be sufficiently addressed within the scope of this thesis and several important questions remain unanswered . First , it was not possible to sequence and assemble the CroV genome in its entire length . Large regions ( ~ 90 kbp at the 5 ' end and ~ 20 kbp at the 3 ' end ) of repetitive DNA at the genome termini , combined with severe problems in the construction of large - insert genomic shotgun libraries , resulted in the technical inability to sequence these regions at present . As DNA sequencing technology continues to advance rapidly , it may be possible to elucidate the CroV genome termini in the future . This would allow a precise analysis of the repeat elements in the CroV genome and yield clues to their function , e . g . , a role in genome replication or telomere - like functions . Second , the CroV microarray experiment was performed before completion of genome sequencing and assembly , which resulted in the exclusion of CDSs from the array that were discovered later . Furthermore , validation of the microarray results through analysis of the virion proteome revealed that at least 44 viral mRNA species had not been detected by the microarray , although the corresponding proteins were found to be part of the virion ( see section 3 . 3 . 6 ) . The microarray results should therefore be interpreted with caution and used only to infer general trends , rather than to extract specific expression data about single genes . It seems worthwhile to conduct a more thorough transcriptomic analysis using 454 technology mRNA deep sequencing , because this technique provides information about transcriptional termination signals and has the potential to reveal new coding regions , as it is independent of a preselected set of hybridization probes [ 69 ] . Third , the Mavirus virophage was discovered during a late stage of the project and consequently , only a limited amount of time could be dedicated to its study . Most importantly , it was not possible to separate CroV quantitatively from Mavirus . A Mavirus - free CroV preparation is an imperative prerequisite for any future studies of the CroV - Mavirus system , since CroV 162 particle yield suffers significantly in the presence of Mavirus . Neither Optiprep - density gradient centrifugation nor preliminary experiments to selectively heat - inactivate Mavirus were successful in obtaining CroV preparations that were completely free of Mavirus particles . However , the separation was sufficient to demonstrate that CroV particle yields differ in the presence and absence of Mavirus . A nearly CroV - free Mavirus preparation was achieved by tangential flow filtration , followed by filtration through 0 . 1 µm pore size PVDF syringe filters ( see section 4 . 2 . 1 ) . In order to corroborate the viral transposogenesis hypothesis , the genome of C . roenbergensis should be scrutinized for integrated forms of Mavirus . This may be done best by subjecting the host cell genome to 454 pyrosequencing and searching for the Mavirus genome signature among the resulting contigs . Any contig that contains the Mavirus genome , linked to additional DNA sequence , would be proof for the existence of a provirophage . Ultimately , a provirophage - containing strain of C . roenbergensis could be used to study reactivation of Mavirus , e . g . in response to CroV superinfection . Such experimental evidence would demonstrate that a long - term association of host cell and virophage is beneficial to the eukaryotic host . This dissertation will hopefully inspire biochemical and structural studies of CroV and Mavirus proteins . The role of CroV - encoded translation components could be a rewarding subject , e . g . by testing the hypothesis that Ile - tRNA synthetase , tRNAs and translation initiation factors such as eIF - 4E initiate translation of CroV mRNAs at non - AUG start codons ( AUA , AUU ) . Other potential target proteins include DNA repair enzymes , topoisomerases , histone acetyl transferase , tRNA pseudouridine 5S synthase , enzymes encoded by the 38 kb fragment of putative bacterial origin , protein disulfide isomerases and thioredoxins , and ubiquitin - pathway enzymes . In addition , the CroV genome may encode features suitable for biotechnological applications , e . g . inteins could be used for controlled protein splicing reactions or conserved promoter elements for developing new expression systems . The ecology of CroV and Mavirus is a highly fascinating subject that could not be addressed within the scope of this dissertation . CroV is the first characterized virus of a ubiquitous marine zooplankton species and it can be inferred that this virus causes mortality in natural populations of C . roenbergensis , which implies an important role for CroV in nutrient cycling and for the community structure of microbial food webs . The ecological impact of the Mavirus virophage is difficult to gauge at this point . Virophages are parasites of giant viruses and benefit the cellular hosts that are infected by these giant viruses . Virophages are proposed to integrate into the genomes of their hosts ( potentially both , host viruses and host cells ) , a process that most likely gave rise to an entire class of eukaryotic DNA transposons , the Maverick / Polinton elements . As 163 such , virophages are new players on the stage of microbial ecology and their exploration promises to reveal new ways in which viruses interact with each other and cellular organisms . Finally , this work will inspire the search for new giant viruses . CroV represents the first virus infecting a bicosoecid and many other eukaryotic groups are still unexplored , including the viruses that may infect them . In Fig . 6 . 2 , viruses of the NCLDV clade are paired with their host organisms on the tree of eukaryotes . Species of three eukaryotic supergroups ( Plantae , Chromalveaolates , and Unikonts ) are infected by NCLDVs and it is likely that under - sampling is the reason why no giant viruses are currently known to infect Excavates and Rhizaria . These lineages contain phagotrophic species of both ecological and medical importance , and given the widespread occurrence of NCLDVs , it is likely that a targeted search for giant viruses in new potential host organisms will be successful . As viruses co - evolve with their hosts and have a significant influence on cellular evolution ( exemplified by the Mavirus - Maverick / Polinton relationship ) , the exploration of new viral hosts also holds great promise to discover new phenomena that will enrich our knowledge about early evolutionary events in the formation of cellular life [ 284 ] . 164 Figure 6 . 2 Giant viruses and their hosts on the tree of eukaryotes .

[ 288 ] , © Trends in Ecology & Evolution 2009 by permission from Elsevier . 6 . 5 Significance of the work The discovery of CroV and the analysis of its 730 kbp genome represent a major advancement in the emerging field of giant virus research . As the first marine mimi - like virus and the largest known marine virus , CroV demonstrates that highly complex DNA viruses are found in oceanic environments , where they are likely to play ecologically important roles by infecting widespread marine zooplankton species such as C . roenbergensis . Analysis of environmental shotgun sequences had already predicted the existence of marine mimi - like viruses [ 97 ] ; however , metagenomic approaches are no substitute for the isolation of specific virus - host systems , which allows for a much more detailed characterization . 165 With 544 predicted proteins , the CroV genome offers plenty of new targets for biochemical and bioinformatic studies . The finding of several translation - and metabolism - related genes demonstrates that these genes may be far more frequent among large DNA viruses than previously thought . Viral enzymes are often smaller than their cellular homologues and their biochemical characterization can help to identify " streamlined " , minimal versions of a given catalytic activity [ 289 , 290 ] . Phylogenetically , CroV represents an interesting case as it is clearly a member of the NCLDV clade with undeniable similarity to Mimivirus , although only a third of the CroV proteins appear to be related to Mimivirus proteins . On one hand , this provides a well - supported basis of common evolutionary origin for these two giant viruses . On the other hand , CroV and Mimivirus are different enough to examine the effects of virus - host gene transfer , the origin of bacterial genes in giant viruses , and the influence of lineage - specific gene expansion on viral genome evolution . Comparative genome analyses involving the CroV genome thus promise to significantly advance our knowledge about the evolutionary origins of giant viruses . The discovery of the CroV - associated Mavirus virophage added another fascinating aspect to the biology of giant viruses . First , Mavirus highlights the unusual complexity of CroV by demonstrating that the intracellular virion factory of CroV contains sufficient resources to sustain the replication of another virus . Second , the CroV - Mavirus system shows that Mimivirus is not the only giant virus to be parasitized by a virophage and that Sputnik is not the only virus parasite of a giant virus . Sputnik was isolated from the freshwater environment of a cooling tower , whereas Mavirus most likely originated from the same coastal sea water sample that CroV had been isolated from . Hence , virophages are found in very different environments and a targeted search for them is likely to result in the identification of various new strains . Third , electron microscopy and co - infection studies of Mavirus and CroV confirmed several predictions of the virophage concept , such as dependency of virophage replication on a co - infecting host virus , co - localization of virophage particles with the virion factory of the host virus , and a profound negative effect of the virophage on host virus propagation [ 31 ] . Forth , despite causing similar phenotypes and exploiting similar strategies , such as replication within the virion factory of their host virus and a shared promoter signal with the host virus , Mavirus and Sputnik are genetically very different . Only four proteins among the two virophages show detectable sequence similarity and their gene order is not conserved . This implies that Sputnik and Mavirus have diverged from a common ancestor a very long time ago . Alternatively , the genetic differences may reflect the malleability of these genomes , if virophages are indeed novel vehicles of horizontal gene transfer among giant viruses [ 31 ] . The discovery of the Mavirus virophage had implications on an even grander biological scale . Only recently have we begun to appreciate the manifold and far - reaching impacts of viruses on cellular evolution . Viruses are a 166 source of novel genes [ 291 ] and during the course of evolution , viral genes have replaced cellular genes on multiple occasions , such as the bacterial RNA polymerase that was substituted with a bacteriophage version after endosymbiosis of an α - proteobacterium [ 292 ] . Our own genome bears witness of an evolutionary past that was heavily influenced by viruses , mainly retroid elements . Up to 45 % of the human genome consists of transposable elements , and most of these are derived from retroviruses [ 128 ] . Genes of retroviral origin have been identified as key players in mammalian placentation [ 293 ] , telomere maintenance [ 294 ] , and chromosomal rearrangements [ 127 ] . Endogenous forms of non - retroviruses such as hepadnaviruses , bornaviruses , and filoviruses have recently been found in vertebrate genomes [ 295 - 297 ] , and further viral links remain to be uncovered . In the context of these remarkable findings , the discovery of Mavirus revealed a completely new mechanism by which viruses have influenced the evolution of eukaryotic genomes . The viral transposogenesis hypothesis presented in this work states that the Maverick / Polinton DNA transposons originated from integration events of ancestral DNA virophages into eukaryotic genomes . This scenario is corroborated by the genetic similarities between Mavirus and Maverick / Polinton transposons and the mechanistic framework of virophage biology , which provides an evolutionary rationale for the association of a eukaryotic cell with a virophage . The ultimate origin of transposable elements is unknown and this work presents , for the first time , convincing data and a parsimonious evolutionary hypothesis for a viral origin of a class of DNA transposons . Such remarkable findings would have been inconceivable at the beginning of this work . Despite being the most abundant biological entities on this planet and representing its largest genetic reservoir [ 7 ] , marine viruses are still among the most understudied life forms and their exploration promises to uncover hitherto undescribed biological phenomena . The genetic complexity of CroV and its intricate and far - reaching interactions with the Mavirus virophage are prime examples for the incredible diversity of the viral world . 167 Bibliography 1 .

PLoS Biol 8 : e1000495 . 190 Appendices Appendix A : 454 pyrosequencing and contig assembly The CroV genome was sequenced using 454 high - throughput pyrosequencing . This method was chosen because it offered cost - effective and quick results and , more importantly , did not require the construction of shotgun clone libraries which posed a significant problem for the CroV genome . Datasets from two different 454 platforms were obtained : the first analysis in December 2005 used the early Genome Sequencer ( GS ) 20 platform ; the second analysis in March 2009 was performed on the newer GS FLX system with Titanium chemistry . The main difference between these two datasets was the average read length , with the CroV GS FLX sequence reads being on average three times as long as the GS 20 sequences ( 370 bp vs . 119 bp ) . Although many of the GS 20 contigs had already been connected via Multiplex PCR and bioinformatic predictions before the GS FLX dataset became available , the GS FLX contigs were crucial in closing the last gaps and finalizing the assembly . In addition , the GS FLX analysis enabled the fortuitous discovery of the Mavirus virophage . The final CroV genome assembly from GS 20 and GS FLX contigs is shown in Figure A . 1 . The longer read lengths of the GS FLX technology resulted on average in fewer and longer contigs , despite a few exceptions such as GS 20 contig 335 , or the genome of an unknown marine phage ( termed phage 307 , Appendix E ) which co - purified with CroV and was assembled into a single contig from the GS 20 data , whereas it was split into three contigs in the GS FLX dataset . In most cases , the contig ends differed between the two datasets , which facilitated assembly . However , larger regions of repetitive DNA could not be overcome by either dataset , resulting in identical contig ends . This was mostly the case for regions containing IP22 repeats , but also other , less common types of repeats and the tRNA gene cluster could not be assembled by the 454 software . Another problem caused by IP22 repeats were ' deletions ' in the contigs , i . e . sequence repeats that were missing from the contigs , but were present in the CroV genome . These artificial deletions were caused by the assembly algorithm , which merged several repeat units into a single one . Nineteen such cases were uncovered ( Table A . 1 ) by comparison of the two datasets or by PCR product length anomalies and subsequent sequencing . It is possible that other occurrences may have gone unnoticed , especially if they were present at the same location in both 454 datasets . There were also several cases of misassembly , which resulted in the fusion of genomic regions that were in reality not adjacent to each other , and in the burial of ' true ' contig breakpoints in the middle of a contig ( see comments in Table A . 1 ) . Uncovering and pinpointing these assembly errors was often difficult and time - consuming , as the only reliable 191 hints to such occurrences were detailed partial contig alignments of the two 454 datasets and PCR analysis , i . e . PCR products whose existence was predicted by the assembly but could not be produced experimentally , or PCR products that were observed experimentally but were not predicted by the assembly . Almost all 454 contigs were accounted for in the final assembly , except for a few short contigs that contained IP22 repeats , and two short , contaminating , bacterial contigs with low coverage ( see Table A . 1 ) . This proves that the DNA samples that were used for 454 pyrosequencing were not contaminated by genomic DNA from the dense bacterial population present in the C . roenbergensis cultures and lysates . All of the large contigs containing unique , non - repetitive sequence were part of the final assembly , which led to the conclusion that the missing ends of the CroV genome are composed of repetitive DNA . 192 Figure A . 1 Assembly map of the CroV genome showing the locations of 454 contigs . Contigs are labelled by numbers , as allocated by the DNA sequencing facility . The scale bar corresponds to the CroV genome and is labelled in base pairs . 193 Table A . 1 Contig statistics and location of contigs in the assembled CroV genome .

The majority of GS 20 contigs exhibited CDSs with high similarity to protistal and Mimivirus genes , but the CDSs on contig 307 were most similar to bacteriophage and bacterial genes . PCR with primer sets oriented distally at the ends of contig 307 resulted in a single product , and sequencing confirmed the circular nature of this 43 , 651 bp long bacteriophage genome . The same genome was found again in the 454 GS FLX dataset , although it was split into three contigs . The host for phage307 is unknown , but it can be assumed that it is part of the mixed bacterial assembly present in C . roenbergensis cultures . PCR primers specific for the phage genome yielded a product when tested on genomic C . roenbergensis DNA isolated from CroV - uninfected cultures . PCR with CroV - specific primers on the same template was negative . Phage307 is thus unlikely to be associated with CroV . However , it is not clear why this bacteriophage co - purified with CroV in sucrose and Optiprep TM density gradients . The missing sequence information in contig 307 , which was later filled in by PCR and Sanger sequencing , was 287 bp long and contained 34 copies of a 12 bp direct repeat with the consensus sequence shown in Fig . E . 1 . Figure E . 1 Consensus sequence of the terminal direct repeat in phage307 . To define start and end of the putative phage genome , the direct repeats were arbitrarily split in half , with the first 17 copies of the repeat assigned to the start and the remaining 17 copies to the end of the genome . In a preliminary genome analysis , I annotated 59 ORFs as putative protein - coding sequences . The genome organization of phage307 is shown in Fig . E . 2 . BLASTP analysis revealed that several CDSs had close homologues in bacteria ( mostly prophages ) and bacteriophages ( Table E . 1 ) . Putative functions could be assigned to some of them , including a Holliday junction resolvase , a terminase , a phage - type integrase , a DnaJ heat 274 shock protein , an endonuclease VIII , an antirepressor , a capsid protein , a capsid protease , a portal protein , and a tail fibre protein . Two phage307 structural proteins ( CDSs 31 and 32 ) were identified during the LC - MS / MS study of the CroV virion proteome ( see section 3 . 3 . 9 ) . The best BLASTP hits of the predicted structural proteins were to podoviruses infecting Burkholderia , Escherichia , and Salmonella . Furthermore , the genome size of 43 , 651 bp fits the size range of podoviruses ( 40 - 42 kbp ) . It is therefore likely that phage307 belongs to the family Podoviridae . In order to assess the ecological impact of this bacteriophage , further experiments will have to be done , first and foremost to identify the bacterial host .

CDSs on forward and reverse strands are shown in blue and the G + C content is represented by the inner black circle ( relative to the genomic average of 55 . 63 % ) . 275 Table E . 1 Putative CDSs of phage307 and their annotation .
