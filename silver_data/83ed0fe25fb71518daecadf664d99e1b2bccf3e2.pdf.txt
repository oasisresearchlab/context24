Its most well - known function relates to the scission of nascent vesi - cles from the plasma membrane during endocytosis ; however , it also participates in the formation of new vesicles from the Golgi network , vesicle trafﬁcking , fusion processes and in the regulation of microtubule , and actin cytoskeleton dynamics . Over the last 8 years , more than 20 mutations in the dynamin - 2 gene have been associated to two hereditary neuromuscular disorders : Charcot – Marie – Tooth neuropathy and centronuclear myopathy . Most of these mutations are grouped in the pleckstrin homology domain ; however , there are no common mutations associated with both disorders , suggesting that they differently impact on dynamin - 2 function in diverse tissues . In this review , we discuss the impact of these disease - related mutations on dynamin - 2 function during vesicle trafﬁcking and endocytotic processes . Keywords : dynamin - 2 , endocytosis , exocytosis , actin , microtubules , mutations , Charcot – Marie – Tooth neuropathy , centronuclear myopathy INTRODUCTION Dynamin was identiﬁed for the ﬁrst time almost 25 years ago as a 100 kDa microtubule - associated protein that induced micro - tubule bundles and promoted microtubule sliding in vivo ( 1 ) . As described by the same authors , the motor activity of dynamin required ATP and other co - puriﬁed polypeptides ( 1 ) . A year later , the same group cloned and sequenced dynamin , and found that it contained a consensus GTP - binding site ( 2 ) , and subsequently characterized its GTPase activity ( 3 ) . At present , three dynamin isoforms encoded by three distinct genes ( DNM1 , DNM2 , and DNM3 ) have been described in mammals ( 4 ) . These exhibit approximately 80 % homology in their sequences , yet they differ in their tissue expression pattern ; dynamin - 1 is mainly expressed in neuronal tissue , dynamin - 2 is ubiquitously expressed , and dynamin - 3 is expressed in brain , testis , and lungs ( 5 ) . Of these three dynamin isoforms , only dynamin - 2 appears to play a pleiotropicroleduringembryonicdevelopment ( 6 ) . Infact , studies in knock - out animals show that deletion of dynamin - 1 or - 3 can becompensatedbytheotherdynaminisoforms ( 7 ) , whilethedele - tion of dynamin - 2 causes early embryonic lethality ( 8 ) . Moreover , as discussed below , mutations in DMN2 result in severe heredi - tary neuropathies and myopathies in humans , strongly suggesting that dynamin - 2 has more susceptible functions in the nervous and skeletal muscle tissues . All dynamin isoforms exhibit at least four alternatively spliced variants , resulting in different dynamin proteins ( 5 ) that share a primary structure comprising : a large amino - terminal GTPase domain ( G - domain ) that binds and hydrolyzes GTP ; a middle and a GTPase effector domains ( GED ) that form a “stalk” structurally essential region ; a pleckstrin homology domain ( PH ) that binds inositol phospholipids and a carboxy - terminal pro - line and arginine rich - domain ( PRD ) that allows interaction with SH3 - domain - containing - proteins ( 5 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Dynamin function relies on its ability to form high order oligomers , and its self - assembly is necessary to promote its cat - alytic activity . Puriﬁed dynamin has been shown to sponta - neously polymerize in the presence of negatively charged tubular templates such as lipid membranes ( 11 ) , microtubules ( 3 , 12 ) , or actin bundles ( 13 , 14 ) as well as after incubation in low ionic strength solutions ( 15 ) . Over the last years several cryo - electron microscopy ( 16 – 18 ) and X - ray crystallographic stud - ies ( 19 , 20 ) of dynamin and its domains ( 21 – 24 ) have allowed a better understanding of the mechanisms mediating dynamin oligomerization . It appears that the stable dimers formed by the crossed interaction between the “stalk” regions of monomeric dynamins ( 20 , 25 ) are the basic unit that allows dynamin poly - merization ( 18 ) , thus promoting the GTPase activation required for membrane remodeling and scission in different cellular processes . In the present review , we discuss the different roles of dynamin during endocytosis , vesicle trafﬁcking , and exocytosis , specially focusing in dynamin - 2 , and how disease - linked mutations in dynamin - 2 gene alter such cellular processes . DYNAMIN AS A KEY COMPONENT OF ENDOCYTOSIS AND VESICLE RECYCLING Dynamin is a GTPase that plays a crucial role in the recycling of secretory vesicle in neuroendocrine cells ( 26 ) . www . frontiersin . org September 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 126 | 1 González - Jamett et al . Dynamin - 2 in the secretory pathway FIGURE 1 | Diagram of dynamin structure and localization of dynamin - 2 mutations linked to CNM and CMT . Dynamins are multimodular proteins comprising ﬁve highly conserved structural domains : a large N - terminal GTPase domain ( G - domain ) , a middle domain , a PH domain that bind phosphoinositides , a GTPase effector domain ( GED ) , and a C - terminal proline rich domain ( PRD ) that interacts with SH3 - domain containing proteins . Most common disease - related dynamin - 2 mutations are represented . Note that almost all dynamin - 2 mutations identiﬁed in CNM and CMT patients are clustered into the PH domains ; only one CNM - linked mutation has been found in GED , and one related to CMT has been identiﬁed in the PRD . The D555del3 mutation is one of the products of a 9 - bp deletion in the exon 14 ( 1652 _ 1659 + 1delATGAGGAGg ) of the dynamin - 2 gene ( 9 ) . This gene deletion also results in a 65 - kDa truncated protein ( 9 ) . For that reason here is described as D555del3 , K554fs . An updated database of DNM2 mutations is at the website www . umd . be / DNM2 / ( 10 ) . The ﬁrst evidence suggesting a role for dynamin in endocytosis came from the mapping and characterization of the Drosophila shibire gene , which was identiﬁed to be the Drosophila homolog of mammal dynamin ( 27 , 28 ) . Drosophila bearing mutations in the shibire gene exhibited a rapid and reversible paralysis at tem - peratures exceeding 29°C ( 29 ) . The ﬁrst ultrastructural analyses of synaptic terminals of shibire mutants showed a decreased number of synaptic vesicles and accumulation of “collared pits”suggesting a blocked step in the endocytotic process ( 30 , 31 ) . These ultra - structural changes were also observed in garland cells , a type of cell considered to be very active in endocytosis , where horseradish peroxidase uptake activity was also reduced , thus conﬁrming an alteration in endocytosis in the shibire mutants ( 32 ) . The role of dynamin in endocytosis in mammalian cells was later demon - strated using dynamin mutants with reduced GTPase activity ( 33 , 34 ) . The use of the non - hydrolyzable GTP analog GTP - γ - S allowed the visualization of endocytotic pits with elongated necks , decorated by electron - dense rings positive for dynamin immunoreactivity , showingthatdynaminoligomerizesaroundthe neck of endocytotic pits ( 35 ) . Moreover , the fact that the dynamin mutant K44A , defective in GTP binding and hydrolysis , speciﬁ - cally blocked the coated vesicle formation without affecting the coat assembly and invagination revealed that dynamin is required for the constriction and subsequent budding of the coated vesicles ( 36 ) . However , later studies suggested that dynamin also plays a role during a pre - collar stage , when the clathrin lattice is growing ( 37 , 38 ) . In this stage , dynamin may function as a scaffolding mol - ecule that interacts with SH3 domain - containing proteins that control coated pit assembly and maturation ( 37 ) . The recruit - ment of dynamin at endocytosis sites ( 39 ) also depends on its interaction with SH3 - domain - containing proteins and phospho - inositides present at the plasma membrane via its PRD ( 40 ) and PH domain , respectively ( 41 ) . Regarding the mechanism by which dynamin catalyzes mem - brane ﬁssion , it has been proposed that the assembly of dynamin into helical oligomers around the neck of clathrin - coated pit pro - motes the dimerization of G domains of adjacent helical rungs , leading to the hydrolysis of GTP ( 18 ) . The GTP hydrolysis triggers a conformational change in the dynamin polymer , allowing the constriction of the dynamin ring ( 18 , 42 , 43 ) . The ring con - striction strength then drives the constriction of the membrane neck , increasing membrane curvature ( 44 ) . Such change in mem - brane curvature raises the local elastic energy , reducing the energy barrier to ﬁssion , and subsequently triggering the spontaneous ﬁssion at the boundary between the dynamin ring and the bare membranes ( 44 ) . The ability of dynamin to catalyze membrane ﬁssion is not only required in CME , but is also needed in other types of endocytotic pathways that are independent of clathrin . For instance , dynamin is required for caveolae - mediated endocytosis ( 45 ) , which is essen - tial for the uptake of molecules such as the complement C5b - 9 complex ( 46 ) . Dynamin also participates in the internalization of the β - chain of the interleukin - 2 receptor through a clathrin inde - pendent , but RhoA dependent process , which is inhibited by the overexpressionof adominantnegativemutantof dynaminGTPase activity ( 47 ) . The entry in host cells of many pathogens and toxins such as anthrax toxin ( 48 ) , Ebola virus ( 49 ) , HIV ( 50 ) , or Hepatitis C virus ( 51 ) also require the participation of dynamin . Finally , the role of dynamin in vesicle formation is not only restricted to the plasma membrane and , as discussed below ; its function is also needed in intracellular compartments . ROLE OF DYNAMIN IN VESICLE TRAFFICKING AND GOLGI FUNCTION Dynamin - mediated vesicle budding and membrane ﬁssion has also been reported in intracellular compartments such as endo - somes ( 52 , 53 ) and Golgi complex ( 54 ) . Regarding dynamin - 2 participation in vesicle trafﬁcking from endosomes , this protein appears to play a role in two different steps : ( 1 ) the vesicle trans - port from late endosomes to the Golgi compartment ( 52 ) and ( 2 ) the recycling pathways from early endosomes ( 53 ) . However , the establishment of dynamin - 2 participation in the post - Golgi vesicle trafﬁcking has been more controversial . Pioneer reports showed that the transport of vesicles from the Golgi to the cell surface or to lysosomes was independent of dynamin ( 36 ) , and according to these results , no evidence of endogenous dynamin - 2 Frontiers in Endocrinology | Neuroendocrine Science September 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 126 | 2 González - Jamett et al . Dynamin - 2 in the secretory pathway localization in the Trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) nor of its partici - pation in vesicle formation from this compartment were observed using different cell lines ( 55 ) . Nevertheless , contemporary studies showed that ectopically expressed dynamin - 2 localizes in the TGN in hepatocytes ( 54 ) and that the formation of clathrin - coated pits from Golgi membranes , in a cell - free assay , was inhibited in the presence of anti - dynamin antibodies , thus indicating the impor - tance of dynamin at this level ( 54 ) . Furthermore , canine kidney cells expressing a GTPase defective dynamin - 2 mutant showed a restricted trafﬁc of the protein p75 from the Golgi to the apical membrane ( 56 ) . Also , the overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of dynamin - 2 was shown to lead to the retention of pro - teins and accumulation of cisternae at the Golgi compartment , suggesting a role of dynamin - 2 in keeping both the structure and function of the TGN ( 57 ) . In agreement with a role of dynamin - 2 in Golgi vesicle forma - tion , it was demonstrated that endogenous dynamin - 2 localizes in the TGN in neuroendocrine mouse pituitary corticotrope cells ( 58 ) , where it interacts with the βγ subunit of G - proteins via its PH domain . Interestingly , the overexpression of the puriﬁed PH domain induced the translocation of dynamin - 2 from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane , increasing receptor - mediated endocytosis but inhibiting basal and CRH - induced secretion of β - endorphins , suggesting a key role of dynamin - 2 in the secretory pathway ( 58 ) . Several studies have highlighted the importance of dynamin - 2 to the proper trafﬁc of nascent proteins from the TGN to the plasma membrane , a process that seems to be dependent on the actin cytoskeleton . In this regard , a subset of actin ﬁla - ments anchored to the Golgi membrane via the small GTPase Arf - 1 appears to form complexes with dynamin - 2 and the actin - binding - protein cortactin , allowing the emergence and post - Golgi trafﬁcking of secretory vesicles ( 59 ) . Other proteins such as LimK1 and its substrate coﬁlin ( 60 ) , syndapin , and the Wiskott – Aldrich - Syndrome - protein ( WASP ) ( 61 ) havebeenalsoinvolvedinthereg - ulation of the peri - Golgi actin cytoskeleton and in the dynamin - mediated transport of secretory vesicles from Golgi to the plasma membrane . Additionally , dynamin - 2 function is necessary for the Golgi fragmentation and vesicle segregation induced by choles - terol in HeLa cells ( 62 ) and for the Golgi vesiculation induced by the c - SRC kinase activation ( 63 ) further supporting a pivotal role of dynamin in the Golgi dynamics along the secretory pathway . DYNAMIN AS A FACILITATOR OF MEMBRANE FUSION Dynamins have been involved in different types of fusion processes . Among them regulated exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells ( 64 – 69 ) , acrosomal reaction ( 70 ) , cell - to - cell fusion ( 71 , 72 ) , and fusion of virus with host cells ( 73 , 74 ) . The ﬁrst evidences showing the involvement of dynamin in exocytosis came from experiments performed at the beginning of 2000 , which suggested that dynamin was involved in kiss - and - run , a transient mode of exocytosis , in neuroendocrine cells ( 64 – 66 ) . In this type of exocytosis , the vesicle partially releases its content , and then it is recovered intact ( 75 , 76 ) . It was then hypothesized that dynamin would allow the reclosure of the vesicle mouth , acting through a mechanism similar to that described for vesi - cle formation during endocytosis ( 77 ) . However , the mechanism by which dynamin controls the quantal release of hormones still remains unclear . More intriguing is the mechanism by which dynamin facilitates the fusion process during exocytosis . For instance , dynamin - 2 reportedly favors granule secretion in both natural killer ( 78 ) and insulin - secreting cells ( 79 ) . More recently , it was reported that , in chromafﬁn cells , dynamin - 1 speeds up the expansion of the fusion pore , an intermediate structure formed during exocytosis , in a GTPase activity - dependent fashion ( 68 ) . Therefore , both dynamin - 1 and - 2 appear to be involved in fusion processes . A possible explanation for this function is that dynamin interacts with SNARE proteins or SNARE - interacting proteins . In this regard , dynamin - 2 has been shown to associate to secretory granules in chromafﬁn cells ( 80 ) via its interaction with syntaxin ( 80 ) and synaptophysin ( 67 ) . In mammalian sperm , dynamin - 2 associates with the SNARE regulatory protein complexin I ( 81 ) , where it favors membrane fusion events during acrosomal exocy - tosis ( 70 ) . In yeast , the dynamin homolog Vps1p interacts with the t - SNARE Vamp3 ; the disruption of this association with an antibody against Vps1p inhibits the fusion reaction ( 82 ) . More recently , Peters’ lab has demonstrated that Vps1 binds to the Qa SNARE Vamp3 and controls trans - SNARE formation , which is essential for membrane fusion in yeasts ( 83 ) . An alternative explanation is that dynamin controls fusion events via actin cytoskeleton dynamics . In this regard , cortical actin is dynamically rearranged during regulated exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells acting as a barrier as well as a carrier for the access of the secretory granules to the plasma membrane ( 84 – 86 ) . Actin ﬁlaments also control the fusion pore expansion ( 87 ) , as dynamin does ( 68 ) . As we discuss below , given that dynamin regulates actin organization ( 13 , 14 , 88 ) , it is plausible to assume that its actions on fusion processes relay on its ability to modulate actin dynamics . According to this idea , we have recently demon - strated that endogenous dynamin - 2 directs a Ca 2 + - dependent polymerization of cortical actin in adrenal chromafﬁn cells . Inter - estingly , both cortical actin and dynamin - 2 regulate the initial fusion pore expansion and quantal release of transmitters , suggest - ing a synergistic action during exocytosis ( 89 ) . Corey Smith and Collaborators found that the fusion pore expansion in chromafﬁn cells is controlled by the association of dynamin - 1 with syn - dapin ( 69 ) , a protein that modulates actin polymerization through neural - Wiskott – Aldrich - syndrome - protein ( N - WASP ) ( 90 ) . The role of dynamin - 2 in fusion processes has also been extended to the fusion of myoblasts to form multinucleated myotubes ( 71 ) . Interestingly , the GTPase activity of dynamin - 2 is required at a stage that follows hemifusion but precedes the expansion of the fusion pores ( 71 ) . The underlying mechanism is still unclear , but it could explain the muscular dysfunction in centronuclear myopathies caused by dynamin - 2 mutations . Dynamin - 2 has also been involved in the cell - to - cell fusion trig - gered by HIV - 1 virus infection ( 72 ) and in fusion between HIV - 1 virus and endosomes ( 73 , 74 ) . The latter authors proposed that dynamin promotes the expansion of the fusion pore that con - nects the HIV - 1 envelope and the endosomal membrane , but the possible mechanism remains to be clariﬁed . Taken together , these ﬁndings indicate a pleiotropic role of dynamin in membrane fusion . Although dynamin does not promote membrane fusion by itself , it seems to act after a hemifu - sion state , facilitating the expansion of the fusion pore ( 71 ) . The www . frontiersin . org September 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 126 | 3 González - Jamett et al . Dynamin - 2 in the secretory pathway underlying mechanism probably relies on dynamin ability to sense membrane curvature and remodel membranes ( 91 ) . DYNAMIN AS A REGULATOR OF MICROTUBULE INSTABILITY Although dynamin was ﬁrst identiﬁed as a microtubules - associated protein ( 1 ) its speciﬁc role in microtubule integrity and dynamics is still unclear . Using papain - digestion experi - ments in vitro , Herskovits and Co - workers observed that the entire PRD constituted a microtubule - binding site ( 34 ) . Later , it was demonstrated that only the PRD amino - terminal region was necessary for the association of dynamin to microtubules , whereas its C - terminus appeared to negatively regulate this inter - action ( 92 ) . Pioneering studies also described that dynamin poly - merized around microtubules , interconnecting them and allow - ing bundle formation ( 1 ) , and in turn , microtubules seemed to stimulate dynamin GTPase activity ( 12 ) . Other ﬁndings showed that the middle domain of dynamin - 2 binds to γ - tubulin ( 93 ) locating dynamin - 2 to the centrosome , therefore suggesting its participation during centrosome cohesion ( 93 ) . More recently , dynamin - 2 was found to be enriched in microtubule bundles at the mitotic spindle of mitotic cells , playing a key role dur - ing the cell cycle progression ( 94 ) . In 2009 , Tanabe and Takei observed that depletion of dynamin - 2 in COS - 7 cells , led to an abnormal accumulation of stable microtubules , consequently inducing disturbance of the microtubules - dependent membrane trafﬁcking . These authors did not ﬁnd alterations in microtubule assembly in cells that expressed a speciﬁc interfering RNA against dynamin - 2 , but they did report increased stability of pre - existing microtubules , suggesting a role of dynamin - 2 in microtubule dynamics instability ( 95 ) . This dynamin role appears to be inde - pendent of its GTPase activity . On the other hand , a deletion of three amino acid residues located at the β 3 / β 4 loops of the PH domain induced decoration of microtubules and accumulation of acetylated tubulin , indicating that this region is required for the correct bundling of microtubules ( 95 ) . The authors also pro - posed that this action of dynamin - 2 on microtubule instability is necessary for a proper formation of Golgi network and vesicle trafﬁcking . DYNAMIN AS A DIRECTOR OF ACTIN CYTOSKELETON DYNAMICS Dynamin - 2 is recruited to different actin - rich structures such as phagocytic cups ( 96 ) , podosomes ( 97 ) , Listeria actin ( 98 ) , lamellipodia ( 99 ) , and ﬁlopodia ( 88 ) , supporting a connection between dynamin - 2 function and actin cytoskeleton polymer - ization . Moreover , both actin and dynamin - 2 have regulatory functions during T cells activation ( 100 ) , phagocytosis ( 101 ) , and clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( 102 ) . In the latter , actin and dynamin - 2 have been shown to exhibit a synergistic action , where one modulates the recruitment of the other , and both participate in membrane remodeling and scission ( 103 , 104 ) . Inalltheseprocesses , dynaminappearstopromoteactinassem - bly in a manner dependent on its GTPase activity ( 14 ) . The mechanism is still unclear , yet it is probably a consequence of its association with several nucleation promoting factors ( NPF ) via a PRD - SH3 interaction ; among them Abp1 ( 105 ) , the N - WASP ( 106 ) , and cortactin ( 13 , 88 ) , all of which have been described as dynamin - partners during actin polymerization . In 2010 , Gu and Co - workers reported a direct interaction between dynamin and short actin ﬁlaments ( F - actin ) . The lat - ter promoted dynamin oligomerization , and in turn dynamin induced F - actin elongation ( 14 ) . These authors suggested a model wherein dynamin would favor actin polymerization by remov - ing the “caping” - protein gelsolin of the “barbed” ends ( 14 ) . More recently , Yamada et al . ( 88 ) demonstrated that dynamin induces actin bundle stabilization in a way dependent on its association with cortactin in growth cone ﬁlopodia , where they seem to form ring - structures along actin ﬁlaments that stabilize F - actin bundles ( 88 ) . Since dynamin oligomerization enhances its catalytic activity ( 14 ) , its association with cortactin during actin polymerization ﬁts better with its role as a GTPase than that of a mere “uncapping” protein . IMPACT OF DISEASE - RELATED DYNAMIN - 2 MUTATIONS IN VESICLE TRAFFICKING AND ENDOCYTOSIS Speciﬁc missense mutations and short deletions into the structural domains of dynamin - 2 have been associated with two congenital autosomic neuromuscular disorders : Charcot – Marie – Tooth neu - ropathy ( CMT ) ( 9 ) and centronuclear myopathy ( CNM ) ( 107 ) . While CMT is a demyelinating disease affecting peripheral nerves ( 108 ) , CNM is characterized by a progressive weakness and atro - phy of distal muscles , usually involving facial and extraocular musculature ( 109 – 111 ) . Although most dynamin - 2 mutations linked to CMT and CNM are located in the middle and PH domains , there are no common mutations to both disorders ( 112 ) and the molecular mechanisms that lead to the neuropa - thy or myopathy remain obscure . Figure 1 shows the localization of the CMT and CNM dynamin - 2 mutations described until now , and Table 1 summarizes their impacts on different cellular processes . Regardinghowthesedisease - relatedmutationsaffectdynamin - 2 oligomerization and catalytic properties , in vitro studies have revealedthattheCNM - linkedmutationsE368K / Q , R369Q / W , and R465Wlocatedintothemiddledomainof dynamin - 2 ( 107 ) aswell as the mutations A618T , S619L / W , and V625del clustered into the PH domain ( 118 ) exhibit an increased stability of the oligomers and an enhanced GTPase activity ( 119 , 120 ) . However , how these and other dynamin - 2 mutations impact on dynamin - dependent cellular processes is still under discussion . Given that the best - known role of dynamin - 2 is to catalyze membranescissionduringendocytosis , mostof thestudiesregard - ing the mechanism underlying CNM associated to mutations in dynamin - 2 have been focused in this cellular process . However , the ﬁndings are contradictory . The overexpression of the CNM - linked mutants R465W , R522H , S619L , P627H V625del , and E650K impaired CME in COS - 1 and COS - 7 cells ( 112 , 115 ) . The fact that the CNM mutant D614N causes intracellular mislocalization of both dynamin - 2 and clathrin ( 121 ) suggests that an impairment in CME could be a consequence of the anomalous distribution of dynamin - 2 and other endocytotic proteins . In opposition to the aforementioned ﬁndings , ﬁbroblasts from patients harboring the mutationsR465WorS619LreportedlydisplaynormalCME ( 112 ) . In a similar manner , embryonic ﬁbroblasts from heterozygous knock - in ( KI ) mice carrying the mutation R465W exhibited no defects in CME ( 113 ) . Unlike the heterozygous R465W KI mice , the homozygous animals displayed impaired receptor - mediated Frontiers in Endocrinology | Neuroendocrine Science September 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 126 | 4 González - Jamett et al .

In this regard , ﬁbroblasts from patients harboring the homozygous mutation F379V , the ﬁrst one linked to a lethal congenital syndrome , also exhibited dysfunctional endocytosis ( 6 ) . In order to compare the effects of dynamin - 2 mutations associated to CNM in a context that mimics the homozygous and heterozygous states , Schmid and Collaborators ( 114 ) estab - lished stable cell lines from dynamin - 2 conditional null mouse ﬁbroblasts and expressed two CNM - linked dynamin - 2 mutants ( E368K and R465W ) . Cells expressing comparable levels of wild - type dynamin - 2 and the given mutant were selected to evaluate clathrin - dependent and independent endocytosis , and also vesi - cle trafﬁcking . The authors showed that none of these mutations affected CME in the condition that mimics the heterozygous state ; and they were able to fully rescue transferrin uptake in dynamin - 2 KO cells . Nevertheless , all these mutants impaired clathrin - independent endocytosis of epidermal grow factor recep - tors and raft - dependent endocytosis of cholera toxin . Further - more , also in the condition that mimics the heterozygous state , all the mutants disrupted trafﬁcking of p75 / neurotrophin recep - tor from Golgi to plasma membrane . It seems therefore plausible that the physiological dysfunctions in CNM patients harboring heterozygous mutations in dynamin - 2 are not a consequence of defective CME , but other dynamin - 2 - dependent processes , such as clathrin - independent endocytosis or vesicle trafﬁcking could be affected in these conditions . Regarding the mechanism underlying CMT associated to dynamin - 2 mutations , Sidiropoulos and Co - workers ( 116 ) sug - gested that an impairment of CME in Schwanm cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CMT neuropathy . They showedthattheCMTmutantsK562E , G358R , G537C , andL570H , but not the CNM mutants R465W and E560K , strongly reduced myelination in dorsal root ganglia explant cultures derived from heterozygous embryos carrying a dynamin - 2 null allele , thus mimicking the heterozygous state . These CMT mutants also reduced transferrin internalization in Schwann cells and motor neurons . Conversely , none of the 11 CNM mutations evaluated in that work had any effect on transferrin internalization , neither in Schwann cells nor in motor neurons , suggesting that CMT and CNM mutations affect different cellular processes . The aforementioned cellular impairments induced by CNM - and CMT - mutations , as well as others not previously mentioned , are summarized in the Table 1 . CONCLUDING REMARKS The secretory pathway plays a pivotal role in mammalian cell func - tion . Its disruption underlies many known diseases , such as those described herein . Dynamin - 2 is critical in such mechanisms , as it regulates Golgi structure and function , cytoskeletal integrity , vesicle trafﬁcking , and most interestingly , membrane fusion . In the last 10 years , more than 20 disease - linked mutations have been reported in the dynamin - 2 gene , affecting different dynamin - mediated cellular processes . Nevertheless , their impact on neuroendocrine tissues remains obscure . Also elusive are the mechanisms by which the said mutations affect actin cytoskeleton dynamicsandexocytosis , processeswhicharedynamin - dependent and critical in the course of the secretory pathway . The latter opens an interesting research ﬁeld that could prove useful to under - stand the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of dynamin - 2 disease - related mutations . Several diseases caused by genetic modiﬁcations remain as the ﬁnal frontier in medicine , and although pivotal hallmarks such as the sequencing of the human genome have been attained , we still have much to learn about the cellular and molecular conse - quences of diverse gene mutations , specially , those that are com - mon in many tissues . In this regard , dynamin - 2 is a ubiquitous protein with diverse pleiotropic roles , whose mutations cause tissue - speciﬁc phenotypes . The existence of pertinent cell and animal models will be extremely useful for better understanding www . frontiersin . org September 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 126 | 5 González - Jamett et al .
