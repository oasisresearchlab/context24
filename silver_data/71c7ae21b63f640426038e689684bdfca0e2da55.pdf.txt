RIN1 signals via two downstream pathways , namely the activation of Rab5 and Abl family kinases . Protein kinase D ( PKD ) phosphorylates RIN1 at serine 351 in vitro , thereby regulating interaction with 14 – 3 - 3 proteins . Here , we report the identification of serine 292 in RIN1 as an in vivo PKD phosphorylation site . PKD - mediated phosphorylation at this site was confirmed with a phospho - specific antibody and by mass spectrometry . We demonstrate that phosphorylation at serine 292 controls RIN1 - mediated inhibition of cell migration by modulating the activation of Abl kinases . We further provide evidence that RIN1 in vivo phosphorylation at serine 351 occurs independently of PKD . Collectively , our data identify a novel PKD signaling pathway through RIN1 and Abl kinases that is involved in the regulation of actin remodeling and cell migration . INTRODUCTION The Ras and Rab interactor 1 ( RIN1 ) was originally identified as a Ras effector that directly interacts with active Ras ( Han and Colicelli , 1995 ; Wang and Colicelli , 2001 ) . RIN1 is highly expressed in neu - ronal tissue but is also present in some epithelial cells ( e . g . , mam - mary epithelial cells [ MEC ] ) as well as HeLa cells ( Bliss et al . , 2005 ) . The RIN1 protein is structured into four functional domains ( detailed in Bliss et al . , 2005 ) . The amino terminal half of RIN1 contains a SRC homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain as well as proline - rich domains . The car - boxyl - terminal section of RIN1 contains a Ras association and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) domain of the subclass most related to the vacuolar protein sorting 9 protein . In addition to active Ras proteins , several interaction partners have been identi - fied , including Rab5 ( Tall et al . , 2001 ) , Abl tyrosine kinases ( Afar et al . , 1997 ; Hu et al . , 2005 ) , signal - transducing adapter molecule ( STAM ) ( Kong et al . , 2007 ) , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ( Barbieri et al . , 2003 ) , and 14 – 3 - 3 proteins ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) . Two downstream pathways for RIN1 have been described so far : First , RIN1 has GEF activity for Rab5 , thereby directly activating Rab5 - mediated endocytosis of several receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR ( Tall et al . , 2001 ; Barbieri et al . , 2003 ; Barbieri et al . , 2004 ) , likely via its interaction with STAM ( Kong et al . , 2007 ) . The Rab5 GEF activity of RIN1 also seems to be important in vivo . RIN1 expression is highest in the postnatal brain ( Han et al . , 1997 ) . Conversely , RIN1 − / – mice showed increased long - term potentiation ( LTP ) in the amygdala and displayed enhanced fear conditioning , suggesting a role for RIN1 in neuronal plasticity ( Dhaka et al . , 2003 ) . In amygdala neurons RIN1 directly interacts with ephrin type - A receptor 4 ( EphA4 ) and mediates its endocytosis in a Rab5 - dependent manner , thereby antagonizing EphA4 signaling ( Deininger et al . , 2008 ) . This signaling pathway may contribute to the regulation of LTP . The second RIN1 - regulated pathway is the direct interaction and activation of Bcr - Abl and Abl / Arg tyrosine kinases ( Afar et al . , 1997 ; Hu et al . , 2005 ) . RIN1 binds to the SH3 and SH2 domains of c - Abl and Arg , thereby stimulating kinase activity .

Volume 22 March 1 , 2011 Phosphorylation of RIN1 by PKD | 571 ditional phosphorylated serine residues within RIN1 . To identify these pMOTIF recognition sites in RIN1 , we searched for potential PKD consensus motifs characterized by a leucine , isoleucine , or va - line residue in the - 5 and arginine in the - 3 position relative to a serine or threonine . Besides serine 351 , two additional serines at positions 291 and 292 match the PKD consensus motif and are con - served across species ( Figure 1B ) . These residues were exchanged for alanines by site - directed mutagenesis , and the mutants were ex - pressed in HEK293T cells and further tested for recognition by the pMOTIF antibody . Mutation of serine 292 to alanine abrogated de - tection of RIN1 with the pMOTIF antibody , whereas the S291A mu - tation did not affect the pMOTIF signal ( Figure 1C ) . This finding sug - gested that serine 292 is a novel PKD phosphorylation site specifically recognized by the PKD substrate antibody . To confirm that serine 292 is phosphorylated in vivo we performed mass spectrometry . To this end , Flag - tagged RIN1 WT was purified from HEK293T cell lysates using Flag - M2 - agarose . To increase the amount of phospho - rylated RIN1 molecules we coexpressed a constitutively active PKD1 protein . Using nano - liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry ( nanoLC / ESI - MS / MS ; Figure 1D , top ) the trypticly digested Flag - RIN1 fusion protein could be unam - biguously identified based on the uninterpreted MS / MS spectra ( MASCOT Mowse Score 2922 ) . For target MS / MS analyses of the monophosphorylated tryptic peptide RESSVGYR ( corresponding to residues 289 – 296 in full - length human RIN1 ) , the doubly charged precursor ion at m / z 517 . 27 ( Figure 1D , middle , left panel ) was cho - sen as a preferred mass . In the tandem mass spectrum of the m / z 517 . 27 precursor ion , an intense peak at m / z 468 . 25 ( 49 . 0 Da mass difference , 98 / 2 Da ) could be observed showing the neutral loss of phosphoric acid from the precursor ion ( Figure 1D , middle , right panel ) . Based on the MS / MS data the phosphorylation site could be determined as serine 292 by the presence of the y - and b - ion series ( Figure 1D , bottom ) . Furthermore , the four previously described phosphorylation sites ( tyrosine 36 , serines 333 and 337 , serine 351 ) ( Wang et al . , 2002 ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ; Beausoleil et al . , 2006 ) were also detected during the analysis ( Supplemental Figure 1 ) . To further investigate the phosphorylation of RIN1 at serines 292 and 351 in intact cells , we raised phospho - specific antibodies against the peptide epitope surrounding these residues in RIN1 . WT Flag - RIN1 was detected with the pS292 and pS351 - specific anti - bodies , whereas the respective serine - to - alanine exchange mutants , Flag - RIN1 S292A and S351A , were not detected ( Figure 1E ) . Fur - thermore , a RIN1 variant mutated at both sites was not detectable with either antibody . Together , our results demonstrate that serine 292 is a novel in vivo phosphorylation site specifically recognized by the PKD substrate antibody . Serine 292 but not serine 351 is a target site for PKD in vivo Mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis identified serine 292 as a novel in vivo phosphorylation site . To confirm that PKD was in - deed capable of directly phosphorylating serine 292 in RIN1 , we performed in vitro kinase assays with purified PKD1 and Flag - tagged RIN1 WT , RIN1 - S351A , RIN1 - S292A , and a RIN1 protein with both serines exchanged for alanines ( RIN1 - S292 / 351A ) . When the RIN1 WT protein was incubated with PKD1 in the presence of [ γ - 32 P ] - ATP , incorporation of radioactivity was detected ( Figure 2A ) . Phosphory - lation was substantially impaired only in the case of the RIN1 - S292 / 351A protein , indicating that both sites , serines 292 and 351 , are phosphorylated by PKD in vitro . To investigate whether in vivo phosphorylation of serines 292 and 351 was dependent on PKD kinase activity , we used Flp - In T - REx - 293 cells that stably express the Tet repressor and contain a single genomic Flp recombination activity is independent of other regulatory mechanisms , such as Src - mediated phosphorylation ( Cao et al . , 2008 ) . It is believed that RIN1 binding to Abl kinases induces a conformational change that leads to a relief of autoinhibition ( Cao et al . , 2008 ) . Subsequently , RIN1 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated by Abl kinases , a process further stabilizing the interaction of the two proteins . RIN1 - mediated acti - vation of Abl kinases is followed by increased phosphorylation of the Abl kinase substrate CrkL and finally by the inhibition of cell migration . Importantly , the direct activation of Abl family kinases through RIN1 is enhanced by activated Ras ( Hu et al . , 2005 ) . These findings are further supported by studies with RIN1 − / – MECs , which demonstrate an increased migration potential compared to wild - type ( WT ) MECs . Accordingly , knockdown of RIN1 in human epithe - lial cell lines leads to the same phenotype . Interestingly , RIN1 is si - lenced in breast tumor cell lines compared to cultured MECs . Silencing likely occurs via DNA methylation within the RIN1 pro - moter snail is not an abbreviation and / or overexpression of the tran - scription repressor SNAIl ( Milstein et al . , 2007 ) . A recent study pre - sented evidence that transforming growth factor - β , a key regulator of epithelial - mesenchymal transition , and receptor tyrosine kinases cooperate to silence RIN1 through expression of SNAIl . The deple - tion of RIN1 enhances growth factor – directed cell migration of breast tumor cells ( Hu et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , RIN1 has been char - acterized as a breast tumor suppressor protein acting as a negative regulator of tumor cell invasive growth ( Milstein et al . , 2007 ) . Taken together , RIN1 is involved in signaling pathways promoting endocy - tosis and actin cytoskeleton remodeling . In the past , Wang and coworkers identified serine 351 within RIN1 as an in vitro phosphorylation site for protein kinase D ( PKD ) . Phosphorylation of this serine residue mediates binding of RIN1 to 14 – 3 - 3 proteins and in part regulates interaction of RIN1 with active Ras ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) . PKD is a family of serine / threonine kinases , the function of which has been studied best at the Golgi complex where it is known to regulate vesicular traffic to the plasma mem - brane ( reviewed in Wang , 2006 ) . More recent studies by us and other laboratories suggest that PKD has additional functions associ - ated with the regulation of cell shape , migration , and invasion . Only a few substrates , however , such as cortactin , E - Cadherin , and sling - shot 1L ( SSH1L ) have been identified so far ( Jaggi et al . , 2005 ; Eiseler et al . , 2009 , 2010 ; Peterburs et al . , 2009 ) . By using a phos - phospecific antibody , we now demonstrate that RIN1 is phosphory - lated on serine 351 in vivo , but independently of PKD . Instead , we report the identification of a novel PKD phosphorylation site , serine 292 , in RIN1 . We demonstrate that phosphorylation at this site occurs in vitro and in vivo . We further provide evidence that serine 292 phosphorylation regulates RIN1 - dependent activation of Abl kinases and , as a consequence , controls directed migration of epithelial cells . RESULTS A novel phosphorylation site in RIN1 is detected by the PKD pMOTIF antibody Both PKD and its substrate RIN1 act as negative regulators of direc - tional cell migration ( Hu et al . , 2005 ; Eiseler et al . , 2007 ) . Whether both proteins are part of a common pathway that inhibits cell migra - tion has not been addressed , however . When ectopically expressed in HEK293T cells , Flag - tagged WT RIN1 reacts with the phospho - specific PKD pMOTIF antibody ( Figure 1A ) , which specifically de - tects phosphorylated PKD consensus motifs ( Doppler et al . , 2005 ) . Interestingly , mutation of the putative PKD phosphorylation site at serine 351 did not fully abrogate the detection of the protein with the pMOTIF antibody ( Figure 1A ) , suggesting the presence of ad - 572 | S .

Volume 22 March 1 , 2011 Phosphorylation of RIN1 by PKD | 573 activity and subsequently in a decrease of serine 292 phosphoryla - tion as judged from detection with the pS292 antibody ( Figure 2B ) . Of note , treatment of cells with Gö6983 did not completely abro - gate PKD activity , and hence serine 292 phosphorylation was higher than that of Gö6976 . This finding suggests that phosphorylation of serine 292 in vivo is PKD - and , at least partly , PKC - dependent . In addition , we analyzed phosphorylation of serine 351 under these conditions . Surprisingly , neither PDBu stimulation nor treatment of cells with PKD and PKC inhibitors induced any detectable changes in serine 351 phosphorylation ( Figure 2B ) . To further characterize PKD as an upstream kinase of RIN1 , we cotransfected HEK293T cells with plasmids encoding PKD1 and PKD2 WT , the constitutive active ( ca ) variants PKD1 S738 / 742E and PKD2 S706 / 710E , and the kinase dead ( kd ) variants of PKD1 K612W target ( FRT ) site to generate cells inducibly expressing RIN1 by Flp recombinase – mediated integration of the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged RIN1 cDNA under the control of a tetracycline regu - latable promoter . In these cells , GFP - RIN1 expression was tightly controlled , with no expression observed in the absence of doxycy - cline ( see Figure 4A later in the paper ) . We treated these stable Flp - In - GFP - RIN1 WT cells with the phorbol 12 , 13 - dibutyrate ( PDBu ) , which is known to stimulate PKD in a protein kinase C ( PKC ) - depen - dent manner ( Wang , 2006 ) . Treatment with PDBu increased PKD kinase activity , based on enhanced PKD autophosphorylation on serine 910 ( Figure 2B ) . Moreover , phosphorylation of RIN1 at serine 292 was strongly increased under these conditions . Treatment of control or PDBu - treated cells with the PKD inhibitor Gö6976 or with the PKC inhibitor Gö6983 resulted in the inhibition of PKD kinase FIGuRE 2 : PKD1 and PKD2 phosphorylate RIN1 on serine 292 . ( A ) HEK293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding Flag - tagged RIN1 WT , S351A , S292A , and S292 / 351A fusion proteins . RIN1 variants were immunoprecipitated with anti - Flag - antibody and incubated in kinase buffer containing [ 32 P ] - γ - ATP in the absence ( – ) and presence ( + ) of purified PKD1 for 10 min . Proteins were separated by SDS – PAGE and transferred to membrane . Incorporation of radioactive phosphate was analyzed using a PhosphoImager ( bottom ) , followed by immunoblotting with Flag - specific and PKD - specific antibodies to verify equal loading of the RIN1 and PKD1 proteins ( top ) , respectively . ( B ) Flp - In T - Rex - 293 - GFP - RIN1 WT cells were treated with doxycycline for 24 h to induce RIN1 expression followed by treatment with Gö6976 or Gö6983 at 10 μM prior to stimulation with PDBu ( 1 μM ) for 15 min . Phosphorylation of RIN1 was analyzed in whole cell lysates as described in Figure 1E . PKD autophosphorylation was verified by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates with specific antibodies ( middle panel ) , and equal loading was controlled with a tubulin - specific antibody ( bottom panel ) . ( C ) HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag - RIN1 together with empty vector , PKD1 - GFP WT , PKD1ca - GFP , PKD1kd - GFP , PKD2 - GFP WT , PKD2ca - GFP , and PKD2kd - GFP expression plasmids . Cells were left untreated or stimulated with PDBu . Phosphorylation of RIN1 ( pS292 and pS351 ) and PKD proteins ( pS910 ) was analyzed by Western blotting as described in Figures 1E and 2B . Expression of RIN1 and PKD1 and PKD2 proteins was verified by immunoblotting with Flag - and GFP - specific antibody , respectively . Shown is a representative Western blot . ( D ) Flp - In T - REx - 293 - GFP - RIN1 WT cells were transfected with lacZ - , PKD1 - , and PKD2 - specific siRNAs as indicated . RIN1 expression was induced 48 h later and analyzed by immunoblotting as described in Figure 1E ( top panels ) . Silencing of PKD1 and PKD2 isoforms was verified by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates with specific antibodies ( middle panels ) , and equal loading was controlled with a tubulin - specific antibody ( bottom panel ) . 574 | S . Ziegler et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell increase in serine 351 phosphorylation . Accordingly , expression of a kd PKD protein did not decrease phosphorylation at this site . This finding confirms that PKD is upstream of serine 292 but not of serine 351 phosphorylation . Finally , to address the question of which PKD isoform was responsible for RIN1 phosphorylation at serine 292 , we used an RNA interference approach to down - regulate PKD1 and PKD2 , singly and in combination in HEK293T cells , which express both PKD isoforms . Silencing of only one isoform did not influence the level of RIN1 phosphorylation as judged by immunoblotting with the pS292 antibody ( Figure 2D ) . Simultaneous knockdown of PKD1 and PKD2 , however , strongly reduced RIN1 phosphorylation , sug - gesting that these two isoforms were primarily responsible for phos - phorylating RIN1 ( Figure 2D ) . Of note , additional depletion of PKD3 had no effect on RIN1 phosphorylation in PKD1 - and PKD2 - deficient cells ( unpublished data ) . Depletion of PKD isoforms , however , did not affect phosphorylation at serine 351 . Taken together , these and PKD2 K580W together with Flag - RIN1 WT . As demonstrated before , stimulation with phorbol ester increased phosphorylation at serine 292 , whereas expression of PKD1kd or PKD2kd inhibited basal and stimulated serine 292 phosphorylation , proving that the PKDkd proteins act in a dominant - negative manner ( Figure 2C , top panel ) . Interestingly , expression of PKDkd did not inhibit PDBu - induced ac - tivation of endogenous PKD proteins evident from detection with the pS910 antibody . Thus we conclude that the kd PKD proteins rather compete for substrate access than block activation of endog - enous PKD . As expected , coexpression of PKD WT and PKDca pro - teins strongly increased basal serine 292 phosphorylation . This phos - phorylation was only slightly enhanced upon PDBu stimulation . Likewise , phosphorylation of endogenous PKD proteins was in - creased upon coexpression of PKD WT and PKDca , suggesting that PKD proteins undergo transphosphorylation . Surprisingly , neither co - expression of active PKD variants nor PDBu stimulation induced an FIGuRE 3 : RIN1 and PKD1 colocalize at sites of actin remodeling .

Volume 22 March 1 , 2011 Phosphorylation of RIN1 by PKD | 575 inhibition of cell migration by RIN1 expression is mediated via acti - vation of Abl tyrosine kinases : The presence of STI571 completely rescued migration of cells expressing RIN1 WT and the S292E mu - tant , whereas no effect was observed in cells expressing RIN1 - S292A ( Figure 4B ) . Accordingly , FCS stimulation of starved cells enhanced PKD activity and CrkL phosphorylation ( Figure 4C , left panel ) , whereas treatment of cells with the PKD inhibitor Gö6976 strongly decreased CrkL phosphorylation in control and in RIN1 - expressing cells ( Figure 4C , right panel ) , indicating that PKD - mediated phos - phorylation of serine 292 modulates RIN1’s ability to inhibit cell mi - gration via activation of Abl tyrosine kinases . To test whether phosphorylation of serine 292 affects Abl kinase activation , we made use of a genetically encoded fluorescence res - onance energy transfer ( FRET ) - based Abl kinase biosensor , termed Abl FRET reporter ( Ting et al . , 2001 ) . This sensor consists of the trun - cated Abl substrate CrkII , and the fluorescence donor – acceptor pair cyan fluorescent protein ( CFP ) and yellow fluorescent protein ( YFP ) . On activation by Abl kinase – mediated phosphorylation of CrkII , an intramolecular complex between the tyrosine phosphorylation site and the CrkII SH2 domain is formed , modifying the orientation of the fusion protein and allowing FRET to occur . To analyze the effect of RIN1 on Abl kinase activity in vivo we transiently expressed the Abl FRET reporter alone or together with increasing amounts of Flag - tagged RIN1 WT in HEK293T cells . Coexpression of RIN1 led to an increase in the emission ratio compared to cells expressing only the Abl FRET reporter . The activation was dependent on the RIN1 concentration reaching a maximum at a 1 : 5 ratio and was com - parable to Bcr - Abl – induced activation of the FRET reporter ( Supple - mental Figure 2 ) . The RIN1 - mediated activation can be attributed in part to PKD - mediated phosphorylation of the protein at serine 292 because a RIN1 - S292A protein had a significantly weaker effect , whereas the RIN1 - S292E protein was comparable to the WT protein at a 1 : 3 ratio ( Figure 4D ) . PKD is activated downstream of Abl ki - nases and novel PKCs during oxidative stress signaling ( Storz et al . , 2003 , 2004 ) . Recent studies demonstrated that active PKD nega - tively regulates breast cancer cell migration ( Eiseler et al . , 2009 ; Peterburs et al . , 2009 ) . Thus it is conceivable that RIN1 - mediated activation of Abl kinases in turn activates PKD and thereby inhibits cell migration . We therefore analyzed whether expression of RIN1 induces PKD activation in an Abl kinase – dependent manner . To this end we used Flp - In T - Rex - 293 cells inducibly expressing GFP - tagged PKD1 and analyzed PKD1 activity in the presence or absence of RIN1 and the Abl kinase inhibitor STI571 . PKD1 activation loop phosphorylation neither increased upon RIN1 expression nor de - creased in response to Abl kinase inhibition compared to the control ( Figure 4E ) . Thus PKD does not appear to be a downstream target of Abl kinases under these experimental conditions . Collectively , our data demonstrate that PKD - mediated phosphorylation regu - lates RIN1’s ability to suppress cell migration in an Abl kinase – dependent manner . DISCUSSION In this study we identify a novel PKD phosphorylation site , serine 292 , in RIN1 . Phosphorylation at this site is specifically mediated by PKD1 and PKD2 is in accordance with previously reported overlap - ping substrate specificities of PKD1 and PKD2 . For example , PKD1 and PKD2 were both shown to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4 - kinase III β and ceramide transfer protein ( CERT ) ( Hausser et al . , 2005 ; Fugmann et al . , 2007 ) . We could show that expression of a phosphorylation - deficient RIN1 S292A variant restored epithelial cell migration compared to the WT RIN1 protein . Furthermore , PKD and phosphorylated RIN1 colocalize at sites of actin remodeling at results prove that RIN1 is a PKD substrate in vitro and in vivo and identify serine 292 as a novel PKD phosphorylation site in RIN1 . Fur - thermore , our data clearly demonstrate that phosphorylation on ser - ine 351 in vivo is independent of PKD activity in this cellular system . In the following experiments we thus focused on the functional role of serine 292 phosphorylation . Subcellular localization of phosphorylated RIN1 RIN1 is a cytosolic protein , recruited to the plasma membrane via interaction with active Ras ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) . A portion of RIN1 is also found on Rab5 - positive endosomes ( Tall et al . , 2001 ) . Immuno - fluorescence staining of Flag - tagged RIN1 in COS7 cells verified that the protein localizes mainly in the cytosol and at distinct sites of the plasma membrane . Of note , RIN1 was also located in the nu - cleus ( Figure 3A ) . Next , we analyzed whether PKD - mediated phos - phorylation affects the subcellular localization of the RIN1 protein ( Figure 3 , A and B ) . Neither the exchange of serine 292 to alanine in RIN1 nor the coexpression of PKD ( Figure 3B ) and the expression of a phosphomimetic RIN1 S292E protein , respectively , alter the local - ization of the protein ( Figure 3A ) ( unpublished data ) . RIN1 is a binding partner and activator of Abl tyrosine kinases , which consequently regulate actin remodeling and cell motility . Thereby , RIN1 blocks cytoskeletal rearrangements and inhibits epi - thelial cell migration ( Hu et al . , 2005 ) . We recently demonstrated that active PKD is recruited to sites of actin remodeling at the lead - ing edge of migrating cells upon growth factor stimulation and negatively regulates cell migration ( Eiseler et al . , 2007 ) . Immuno - staining of Flag - RIN1 in COS7 cells revealed that the protein colo - calizes with F - actin – rich structures at the leading edge ( Figure 3B , top panel , arrow ) . Flag - RIN1 and PKD1 - GFP colocalize at these sites when coexpressed in COS7 cells ( Figure 3B , bottom panel , arrow ) , indicating a potential interaction of the two proteins at this location . These findings were corroborated by analysis of MCF7 cells express - ing GFP - tagged RIN1 . Immunostaining using the pS292 specific antibody revealed that phosphorylated RIN1 colocalizes with F - actin at sites of active actin remodeling ( Figure 3C , arrow ) . Phosphorylation at serine 292 is critical for RIN1 - mediated inhibition of cell migration To address whether the phosphorylation at serine 292 was involved in RIN1 - regulated cell migration we used Flp - In - T - Rex 293 - GFP - RIN1 WT cells . Treatment of these cells with doxycycline led to a sevenfold increase in the phosphorylation of the Abl kinase sub - strate CrkL at tyrosine 207 . The phosphorylation of CrkL was depen - dent on the activity of Abl tyrosine kinases as treatment of cells with STI571 , a potent Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor , completely blocked the RIN1 - mediated induction of CrkL phosphorylation ( Figure 4A ) . It has been proposed that RIN1 is an inhibitor of epithelial cell migra - tion ( Hu et al . , 2005 ) . Consequently , directed migration of cells ex - pressing RIN1 - WT was significantly decreased ( p < 0 . 0001 ) com - pared to control cells in a Transwell assay using fetal calf serum ( FCS ) as chemoattractant ( Figure 4B ) . PKD has also been described to negatively regulate epithelial cell migration . To address whether ser - ine 292 phosphorylation modulates RIN1 - regulated cell migration we induced cells to express GFP - RIN1 WT and the S292A mutant . Furthermore , we created cells expressing a phospho - mimic mutant in which serine was replaced by glutamic acid ( S292E ) . Cells were then subjected to a chemotactic Transwell assay in the absence or presence of STI571 . Mutation of serine 292 to an alanine was found to completely abrogate the RIN1 WT – induced inhibition of cell mi - gration , whereas the S292E mutation slightly enhanced the RIN1 WT – mediated effect ( Figure 4B ) . In addition , we demonstrated that 576 | S . Ziegler et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell ( Figure 2B ) affected phosphorylation of serine 351 in HEK293 cells . Phosphorylation at this site induces the binding of 14 – 3 - 3 proteins , a mechanism that is common for a number of PKD substrates ( Hausser et al . , 2006 ; Peterburs et al . , 2009 ; Scholz et al . , 2009 ) . No - tably , PKD , MAP kinase - activated protein kinase 2 ( MAPKAP2 ) , MAP / microtubule affinity - regulating kinase ( MARK ) , and Calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) show similarities in terms of active sites and substrate specificity ( Doppler et al . , 2005 ; McKinsey , 2007 ) . For example , phosphorylation of histone deacetylase 5 the leading edge of migrating cells . We further demonstrate that the previously identified phosphorylation at serine 351 is not de - pendent on PKD in vivo . This result is in contrast with those obtained by Wang and coworkers , who demonstrated PKD - mediated phos - phorylation of serine 351 using an in vitro kinase assay and meta - bolic labeling of COS7 cells in the presence or absence of ectopi - cally expressed PKD ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) . Although we could confirm the results obtained from the in vitro kinase assay ( Figure 2A ) , nei - ther inhibition ( Figure 2 , B and D ) nor activation of endogenous PKD FIGuRE 4 : Phosphorylation of RIN1 at serine 292 coordinates cell migration in an Abl kinase – dependent manner .

Expression of RIN1 proteins and phosphorylation of CrkL were assessed using GFP - and pCrkL - specific antibodies , respectively . Detection of tubulin served as a control . Volume 22 March 1 , 2011 Phosphorylation of RIN1 by PKD | 577 RIN1 homologue Sprint cooperates with Cbl at the front of border cells in the spatial control of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to ensure accurate migration ( Jekely et al . , 2005 ) . A function for PKD in Rab4 - dependent recycling of α v β 3 integrin has been demonstrated ( White et al . , 2007 ) . It is thus intriguing to speculate that PKD - medi - ated phosphorylation could be involved in the regulation of RIN1’s GEF activity toward Rab5 . PKD directly interacts with F - actin and localizes to F - actin cortical structures ( Eiseler et al . , 2007 ) , making it likely that PKD is involved in processes regulating cytoskeletal remodeling and cell migration . Indeed , overexpression of PKD WT strongly inhibited migration of cells , whereas expression of a dominant - negative PKD variant sig - nificantly increased cell migration compared to the control ( Eiseler et al . , 2007 ) . Recent studies identified the cofilin phosphatase SSH1L as a physiological PKD substrate ( Eiseler et al . , 2009 ; Peterburs et al . , 2009 ) . PKD - mediated phosphorylation inhibits the activating interaction of SSH1L with F - actin . Consequently , the actin depolymerization factor cofilin is kept in an inactive status . Thus PKD inhibits the generation of free barbed ends at the front of mo - tile cells , actin filament assembly , and membrane protrusion . Recent data also indicate a direct role for PKD in actin polymerization and lamellipodia extension through phosphorylation of cortactin ( Eiseler et al . , 2010 ) . Our data on the interplay of PKD and RIN1 suggest that PKD uses multiple modulators and substrates to regulate cell migration . It will be important to determine precisely when and where the PKD substrates SSH1L , cortactin , and RIN1 are phospho - rylated and how this contributes to actin remodeling and cell migra - tion . RIN1 has been characterized as a negative regulator of tumor cell invasive growth . Of note , a RIN1 mutant that is deficient in bind - ing to and activating Abl kinase was unable to block cell invasion , implicating a critical role for Abl kinases in this process ( Milstein et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , knockdown of PKD1 by RNA interference promoted the invasiveness of cell lines that expressed PKD1 at rela - tively high levels ( Kim et al . , 2008 ) . Future studies will address whether PKD and RIN1 cooperate in invasion of breast tumor cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS DNA constructs , reagents , and antibodies Full - length human RIN1 cDNA was amplified by PCR with primers containing Eco RI and Xho I restriction sites using the RZPD clone IRAUp969F0865D6 as a template and cloned into pCR3 . V62 - Met - Flag and pEGFP - C2 vector , respectively . The point mutants of RIN1 were generated by QuikChange site - directed PCR mutagenesis fol - lowing the manufacturer’s instructions ( Stratagene , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) . To generate the inducible RIN1 expression plasmid pcDNA5 / FRT / TO - EGFP - RIN1 , the cDNA encoding GFP - RIN1 was excised from the pEGFP - C2 - RIN1 plasmid with Age I and Hpa I and li - gated with pcDNA5 / FRT / TO digested with Eco RV . Integrity of all constructs was verified by sequencing . Plasmids encoding PKD1 and PKD2 WT , ca PKD1 - S738 / 742E and PKD2 - S706 / 710E , and kd PKD1 - K612W and PKD2 - K508W were described previously ( Hausser et al . , 2005 , 2006 ; Czondor et al . , 2009 ) . The Abl FRET reporter ( Ting et al . , 2001 ) was provided by Roger Tsien ( Univer - sity of California at San Diego ) . An expression plasmid encoding Bcr - Abl was obtained from Michaela Scherr ( Hannover Biomedi - cal Research School , Hannover , Germany ) . Antibodies specific for PKD1 autophosphorylation at serine 910 and activation loop phosphorylation at serines 738 and 742 , respectively , have been described elsewhere ( Hausser et al . , 2002 ) . Commercially available antibodies used were as follows : anti - PKD2 rabbit ( HDAC5 ) on conserved residues induces the binding to 14 – 3 - 3 pro - teins and is dependent on a signaling pathway involving CaMKII and PKD in cardiac myocytes ( Wu et al . , 2006 ) . It is thus conceivable that , depending on cell type and stimulus , these kinases contribute to RIN1 phosphorylation at serine 351 in vivo . At the plasma membrane , RIN1 has been demonstrated to inter - act with and activate Abl tyrosine kinases . RIN1 directly binds to the SH3 and SH2 domains of c - Abl and Arg , thereby stimulating kinase activity , possibly by inducing a conformational change . Subse - quently , RIN1 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated by Abl kinases , a process further stabilizing the interaction of the proteins . RIN1 - me - diated activation of Abl kinases is followed by increased phosphory - lation of the Abl kinase substrate CrkL ( Hu et al . , 2005 ) . Abl tyrosine kinases are important regulators of cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell migration ; however , existing evidence regarding the role of Abl kinases in cell migration is conflicting . Several reports demonstrate that active Abl kinases promote cell migration and / or invasion ( Srinivasan and Plattner , 2006 ; Stuart et al . , 2006 . In contrast , re - duced activity of Abl and Arg kinases leads to increased cell migra - tion in immortalized cell lines . Cells lacking Abl and Arg by genetic deletion ( abl – / – arg – / – ) exhibit an enhanced ability to migrate in a haptotactic and chemotactic manner relative to WT cells . Con - versely , overexpression of either Abl or Arg inhibited cell migration most likely by uncoupling the CrkII - CAS ( Crk - associated substrate ) complex ( Kain and Klemke , 2001 ) . In addition , Abl and its substrate CrkII collaborate with Rho - ROCK1 to induce cell retraction ( Huang et al . , 2008 ) . A recent study suggests that Arg restricts actomyosin contractility and thereby controls coupling of the cell to the sub - strate via focal adhesions ( Peacock et al . , 2007 ) . In line with the re - ported negative role of Abl in cell migration , overexpression of the Abl activator RIN1 negatively regulated receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) - mediated cell migration , whereas siRNA - mediated knock - down of RIN1 led to increased migration and invasion of epithelial cells ( Hu et al . , 2005 , 2008 ) . We show here that RIN1 - mediated inhi - bition of epithelial cell migration is dependent on Abl kinase activa - tion . Furthermore , we demonstrate that this process is modulated by PKD - mediated phosphorylation of serine 292 . Serine 292 is lo - cated within the Abl binding domain and in close proximity to the proline - rich region , which mediates binding of RIN1 to the SH3 do - main of Abl kinases ( Bliss et al . , 2005 ) . Mechanistically this resem - bles extracellular signal - regulated kinase – mediated phosphoryla - tion of cortactin , which liberates the intramolecular interaction of cortactin’s SH3 domain with the proline - rich domain . This liberation in turn allows cortactin to interact with and activate neuronal Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) via its liberated proline - rich regions ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2004 ) . Although RIN1 does not possess a genuine SH3 interaction domain , phosphorylation of serine 292 could facilitate or stabilize initial binding between RIN1 and Abl kinases by inducing conformational changes enabling in - teraction of the proline - rich region with the Abl SH3 domain . Abl and Arg have been reported to localize to sites of F - actin remodeling , such as membrane ruffles or the leading edge of migrating cells ( Lewis et al . , 1996 ; Woodring et al . , 2002 , 2003 ) . Interestingly , our data show that phosphorylated RIN1 is present at these structures , making it likely that both proteins interact at these sites . Thus PKD - mediated RIN1 phosphorylation could be important for fine - tuning local Abl kinase activity at the leading edge of migrating cells . Besides the activation of Abl kinases , RIN1 activates Rab5 via its GEF domain ( Tall et al . , 2001 ) and promotes clathrin - mediated en - docytosis of tyrosine kinase receptors , such as EGFR ( Barbieri et al . , 2003 ) .

Migrated cells were fixed using 4 % PFA , and the inside of the Transwell insert was wiped with a cotton swab to remove nonmigrated cells . To quantify migration , cells on the filter were stained with crystal violet . After washing , filters were photo - graphed using a widefield fluorescence microscope ( Leica ) equipped with a CCD camera . Results were calculated as median number of migrated cells per visual field with at least four images per filter .
