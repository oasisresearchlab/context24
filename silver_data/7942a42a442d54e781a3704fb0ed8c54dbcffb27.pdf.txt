IBD is believed to arise in a dysfunctional intestinal barrier which allows the normal gut flora to trigger an unwanted chronic immune response in genetically susceptible individuals . The cause of these illnesses is unknown , and treatment today is solely to alleviate the symptoms . In order to identify biomarkers that could help us to further our understanding of the pathophysiology of UC , we applied the subtractive suppression hybridization ( SSH ) method to identify UC - differentially regulated genes in colonic mucosal biopsy specimens ( Paper I ) . The 331 differentially expressed genes were grouped into functional categories and when analyzed revealed a gene expression pattern consistent with UC as an inflammatory disorder with altered epithelial homeostasis . Interestingly , 21 genes were found to be involved in membrane trafficking . Moreover , 37 of the 331 genes were unknown genes with no predicted function . Based on the sequence homology to the WASP - protein ( connected to the immunodeficiency disorder Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ) one unknown gene was selected for further investigation . We named the gene WAFL . While the initial characterization of WAFL revealed a broad tissue expression , qPCR analysis indicated that WAFL was upregulated in inflamed tissue of UC compared to inflamed tissue from CD patients ( i . e . consistent with the SSH data ) . To learn about the function of this protein we initiated a detailed investigation . One approach was to obtain the structure of the protein . In Paper II , the expression of regions of WAFL in E . coli , and in insect cells via a baculoviral system , is described . These peptides were purified and were found to be folded correctly . They have subsequently been used for functional tests of WAFL . The major finding in my thesis , Paper III , links WAFL to regulation of early endosomes . WAFL interacts with actin and WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) , which implies a role in actin - based transport of the endosomes . Moreover , cells depleted of WAFL by RNAi exhibited a disturbed transport of endocytic cargo towards lysosomes . Protein mapping experiments showed that the endosome localization is mediated by WAFL’s central coiled - coil domain . This domain of WAFL binds to the integral membrane components monophosphorylated phosphatidylinositols , in particular PtdIns ( 3 ) P which is found on early endosomes . Interestingly , WAFL appears also on the phagosome of invasive bacteria such as Salmonella , Yersinia , and Shigella indicating that WAFL may be involved in the phagocytosis process . The observation that induced expression is observed in macrophages support this possibility . In conclusion , we have identified and characterized a novel gene , WAFL , from UC bioptic material . This interesting gene is upregulated in inflamed tissue of UC patients and has potential functions in the correct processing of phagosomes and early endosomes . LIST OF PUBLICATIONS I .

An organism is constituted of cells , and a cell consists of molecules which must work in harmony . ” André Lwoff Medicine can be studied on many different levels : genetic , protein , cell , tissue , organism , or population . In the clinical setting , medical investigations will start with a disease , with symptoms from a patient . A clinical diagnosis will start to emerge as other patients appear with the same symptoms . Usually a diagnosis is a relief to the patient , but it does not necessarily explain what the problem is . However , as a clinical diagnosis , a disease , is established , the search for a cure or a relief of symptoms commences . If a treatment for similar ailments exists this will be employed , and could often prove to be helpful . For some diseases , there is no need for deeper investigations into causes , if the treatment is effective and curative . This is however seldom the case , usually temporary relief of symptoms can be offered , but to find a cure one also needs to find what is causing the disease . On the other side of the spectrum of medical research is the study of the functioning organism . How can we ever describe a flaw in the system , when we do not know how it works when healthy ? The human genome project has uncovered the human genes , the blueprint of our existence . Genes code for proteins which are the workers of life . They carry out the tasks that are needed to keep the body at health , and they do it in the context of the cell . The cell is a perfect machine in itself . It is self - repairing and usually renewable . In simpler forms of life the cell is the organism . In complex beings like ourselves the cells are cooperating and specialize into tissues which seemingly work as units within the body . But let us not forget that the cell is still the basic unit of life . If dysfunction arises here , it will cause disease for the whole organism . Ulcerative colitis is a diagnosis which is based on certain clinical findings such as colonic inflammation and bloody diarrhea . It is grouped together with Crohn’s disease as inflammatory bowel disease . The two diagnoses are often difficult to differentiate and there are no clear molecular markers for either one . Treatment is aimed at attenuating the inflammation and when this is unsuccessful , surgery can be the last resort . The cause of disease has not been proven , and there is no pharmacological cure . Current studies of ulcerative colitis aim at finding the faulty part , and when this is established , mending it to ultimately cure the disease . My project started with a gene expression study of colonic biopsies from ulcerative colitis patients . We aimed at elucidating the changes in protein levels in the diseased colon , and to find new potential genes that could shed more light on the pathogenesis of disease . We confirmed results from previous reports where dysregulated genes were found with function in inflammation , epithelial barrier function , cell cycle and metabolism . Our study also describes a small subgroup of genes in membrane trafficking . Additionally 11 % of the found genes were without described function , and we selected one for 2 further study , mostly due to its similarity to WASP , the mutated protein in the immunodeficiency disease Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome . We called this interesting new player WASP and FKBP - like , WAFL . However , when there was no obvious direct connection to inflammation , our efforts were to reveal its biological function in attempt to further understand disease development in UC . In allegory , WASP is important in the fundamental cell function of actin polymerization and when dysfunctional , causes severe immune impairment , clearly demonstrating that cell biology is the basis of an organism’s health . Investigations led us to place WAFL in the functional context of the cytoskeleton and endocytic transport . We also found an intriguing localization to internalized bacteria . These biological processes are all interconnected and relevant in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis . The story of WAFL is a clear example of how a clinical problem points to disturbances at the core of a cell’s machinery . The following sections are aimed at giving the background to the setting in which WAFL operates . The focus is mainly on processes in vertebrates , since WAFL does not appear to have any homologues in lower organisms . 1 . 1 THE CELL Cells in multicellular organisms come in many shapes and flavors . Differentiation into specialized cells requires different cell morphology and different activities . Some cells , like activated macrophages , exhibit highly motile behaviour , while others , such as epithelial cells of the intestine , fulfill their function partly by adhering tightly to their neighboring cells . However , in order to live and fill their purpose they need a functioning infrastructure , the cytoskeleton . Whether it is about processes common to all cells , like organelle positioning or maintaining cell shape , or more specialized processes like transcytosis , they ultimately rely on the cytoskeleton . The eternal companion of the cytoskeleton is the cell membrane in all its different variants , creating the cellular compartmentalization that is intrinsic to eukaryotic life forms . 1 . 2 THE CYTOSKELETON The cytoskeleton gives the eukaryotic cell its shape and is also the framework that enables it to execute its functions . Indeed , it is working both as the “skeleton” and as the “muscles” of the cell : networks of protein filaments extend throughout the cytoplasm and create organization among the organelles and cellular compartments . Movements of the cell , as well as components within it , also depend on the cytoskeleton . There are three major components of the cytoskeleton : the microtubules , the intermediate filaments , and microfilaments . These long filaments are all made up of smaller subunits that join by polymerization : thousands of subunits assemble into long threads that can stretch from one side of the cell to another . 3 1 . 2 . 1 Microtubules Microtubules determine the positions of membrane - enclosed organelles and direct intracellular transport . They also have a crucial function in cell division where they form the mitotic spindle that segregates the chromosomes . Tubulin polymerization Microtubules are about 25 - nm thick , polar hollow tubes with their walls made from heterodimers of the (cid:302) - and (cid:533) - tubulin isoforms ( Nogales et al . , 1999 ) . Polymerization is GTP - dependent . There are cycles of growth and shrinkage , known as dynamic instability ( Gardner et al . , 2008 ; Mitchison and Kirschner , 1984 ) . The dynamic behavior of microtubules is modified by interactions with microtubule - associated proteins ( MAPs ) . Some MAPs stabilize microtubules by capping their ends and some destabilize microtubules by severing them or increasing the rate of depolymerization . Microtubule - organizing center In animal cells most microtubules extend from the centrosome which serves as the microtubule - organizing center which is localized next to the nucleus . In mitosis the microtubules form the mitotic spindle that organizes the alignment of duplicated chromosomes at the metaphase plate ( Walczak and Heald , 2008 ) . Kinesins and dyneins Microtubules mediate intracellular transport and positioning of membrane vesicles , macromolecules and organelles . The movement along microtubules is achieved by the action of two large families of motor proteins : the kinesins and the dyneins . Most kinesins move toward the plus end ( in general towards the cell periphery ) and dyneins toward the minus end ( toward the cell center ) . The molecular motors possess two ATP hydrolyzing motor domains that step progressively in a hand - over - hand fashion on the microtubule track ( Ross et al . , 2008 ) . 1 . 2 . 2 Intermediate filaments The intermediate filaments mainly confer mechanical strength to the cell since they offer cushion against tensile forces . They are unique to metazoans , in contrast to microtubules and microfilaments . Intermediate filaments provide the support against mechanical stress that in plants and fungi is provided by their cell wall ( Herrmann et al . , 2007 ) . Intermediate filaments are unique in that they are both strong and highly flexible and it has been shown that they can be stretched by 250 - 350 % before they break ( Kreplak et al . , 2005 ) . The intermediate filaments are organized into extensive cytoskeletal networks that span , and possibly connect , the cell surface to the nucleus . At the cell surface intermediate filaments are linked to the supporting extracellular matrix via desmosomes , hemidesmosomes , focal adhesions and linker proteins ( Capetanaki et al . , 2007 ; Green and Simpson , 2007 ) . Intermediate filament structure Intermediate filaments display an enormous diversity compared to microfilaments and microtubules . This is shown on gene level as well as in filament formation and tissue expression . In humans , there are at least 65 genes coding for intermediate filament proteins , and they show great sequence diversity ( Schweizer et al . , 2006 ) . The 4 expression of them is tissue - specific and developmentally regulated , and the filaments are apolar hetero - or homopolymers of these subunits ( Goldman et al . , 2008 ) . 1 . 2 . 3 Microfilaments Microfilaments are thin , flexible fibers made up of polymerized actin . Actin is a very abundant protein in all types of eukaryotic cells . The filaments are around 7 nm in diameter and up to several micrometers in length . They are cross - linked into networks or bundles . In most cases a shell of microfilaments supports the plasma membrane and bundles of filaments , stress fibers , span through the cell starting from the focal adhesion points where the cell is attached to its environment . When the cell is moving , actin is used to generate membrane protrusions at the leading edge . Typically one differentiates between two types of membrane protrusions : lamellipodia , which are broad and sheet - like and made up a network of actin , and filopodia ( also known as microspikes ) , thin fingerlike protrusions supported by bundled actin fibers . In muscles , the sliding of myosin filaments along microfilaments is the basis for muscle contraction . Actin polymerization Actin is a polar molecule that comes in six isoforms in mammals , divided into three subclasses : (cid:302) , (cid:533) , and (cid:534) ( Vandekerckhove and Weber , 1978 ) . The expression of the different isoforms varies between cell types , and the isoforms also have different polymerization kinetics . However , the significance of this diversity is not entirely clear ( Sheterline et al . , 1995 ) . Actin polymerization is ATP - dependent and can occur spontaneously under physiological conditions , thus forming bi - helical , polarized filaments in vitro . One end grows faster than the other and is referred to as the barbed , or plus end , and the slower one is the pointed , minus end ( Pollard and Mooseker , 1981 ) . In vitro the assembly at the plus end and the disassembly at the minus end can lead to a dynamic phenomenon known as treadmilling , when no net change in filament length occurs ( Wegner , 1982 ) . In the cell actin turnover is enhanced by about 150 - fold , compared to in vitro , as it is actively used in cellular processes ( Didry et al . , 1998 ) This is mediated by the action of actin - binding proteins that sever filaments , enhance subunit disassembly from the pointed end and facilitate ATP - for - ADP nucleotide exchange on free actin subunits to enable new polymerization . The rate - limiting step , the de novo actin polymerization , relies heavily on accessory proteins , since it is unfavorable in vitro ( Sept and McCammon , 2001 ) . Proteins that can initiate actin polymerization are called actin nucleators . The Arp2 / 3 complex was the first to be identified and is still the most studied . 5 Figure 1 Microfilaments create the lamellipodia that sense the environment as the cell moves forward . A mouse embryonic fibroblast was stained with phalloidin for actin . Arp2 / 3 complex The Arp ( Actin - related protein ) 2 / 3 complex consists of the stable assembly of two actin - related proteins ( Arp2 and 3 ) and five accessory polypeptides ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . They nucleate actin , i . e . initiate the start of polymerization , by mimicking the structure of two bound actin subunits , and then binding a third actin molecule . The activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex is primarily controlled by the WASP - family of actin regulators ( see section 1 . 3 ) ( Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex has also been reported to bind to the side of pre - existing microfilaments and induce the formation of a branched , daughter filament ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . The complex is then left incorporated at the pointed end of the filament . The branched filaments made by the Arp2 / 3 complex are suggested to be especially abundant in the lamella where they would function as the mechanical force that pushes the membrane forward ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . However , the existence of branched actin has been questioned . In a recent paper Koestler et al propose a different model whereby the actin meshwork seen at the lamella is made up of individual filaments at an angle to the front ( Koestler et al . , 2008 ) . There are also indications that branched actin could be invoked by the use of the F - actin binding drug phalloidin when processing the cells ( Mahaffy and Pollard , 2008 ) . Myosin motors The cell takes advantage of the actin filament tracks for movements of various cargo using ATP - dependent myosin molecular motors . The human genome contains nearly 40 myosin genes , divided into 12 different classes . In general , the myosins form two - headed dimers which move progressively in a hand - over - hand fashion . Most myosins 6 move toward the plus end , but there are also minus - end - directed motors such as Myo6 , and bidirectional such as Myo9b ( Krendel and Mooseker , 2005 ) . 1 . 3 WASP - FAMILY OF ACTIN REGULATORS 1 . 3 . 1 Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome The Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) is a rare X - linked recessive disease . Its is characterized by severe immunodeficiency and microthrombocytopenia ( a decreased number of small platelets ) ( Aldrich et al . , 1954 ; Wiskott , 1937 ) . Symptoms include manifestations such as eczema , internal bleedings , recurrent infections , increased risk of autoimmune disease , and B - cell lymphomas . The only proven cure for the disease is bone marrow transplantation ( Dupuis - Girod et al . , 2003 ; Shcherbina et al . , 2003 ; Sullivan et al . , 1994 ) . Mutations in WASP In 1994 the mutated gene was identified and appropriately named Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) ( Derry et al . , 1994 ) . WASP is only expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin ( Parolini et al . , 1997 ) , and was found to be important for regulating the actin cytoskeleton downstream of the Rho GTPase Cdc42 ( Aspenstrom et al . , 1996 ; Kolluri et al . , 1996 ; Symons et al . , 1996 ) . Defects in actin - based structures can be seen in leukocytes from patients . Functionally the deficiency of WASP leads to disturbed localization , activation , and function of leukocytes which severely impairs the immune system . Lymphocytes and antigen - presenting cells cannot migrate to their site of action , and cell - cell signaling at the immunological synapses is unproductive , as shown for T - cells ( Dupre et al . , 2002 ) , and dendritic cells and NK - cells ( Borg et al . , 2004 ) . The WASP knock - out mouse exhibits WAS - like disease , with few and abnormal hematopoietic cells and T - cell signaling defects . Interestingly , they also have colitis with a Th2 - cytokine profile that closely mimics that of ulcerative colitis . Colonic inflammation has also been reported in WAS patients ( Nguyen et al . , 2007 ) . 1 . 3 . 2 Actin regulators via the Arp2 / 3 - complex WASP is the founding member of a family of actin regulators that act via the Arp 2 / 3 - complex . There are five members which are divided into two subgroups : the WASPs ; WASP and Neural ( N - ) WASP ; and the WAVEs ( WASP family verprolin homologous ) also known as SCARs ( suppressor of cAMP receptor ) : WAVE1 , WAVE2 , and WAVE3 . They consist of ~ 500 amino acid residues and share similar molecular organization . The main structural difference between the groups is in the N - terminus . WAVE proteins lack the WH1 and the GBD domains of WASP and N - WASP ; instead they exhibit a SCAR homology domain ( SHD ) in the N - terminus ( Bear et al . , 1998 ; Miki et al . , 1998b ; Suetsugu et al . , 1999 ) . The WASP family of proteins is today recognized as scaffold proteins that convert signals coming from up - stream events to actin polymerization by the Arp2 / 3 complex . WASP / WAVE proteins will start the process by activating the Arp2 / 3 complex and supplying an actin monomer . This event is central in cellular events such as membrane 7 trafficking , podosome formation , cell adhesion , pathogen entry , neurite extension and spine formation ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . 1 . 3 . 3 WASP and N - WASP N - WASP was originally identified in neural tissue , but is now known to be ubiquitously expressed , whereas WASP is exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells ( Miki et al . , 1996 ) . Protein architecture WASP and N - WASP share a high sequence homology . In the very C - terminus they have the verprolin - homology domain ( V , also called WASP - homology - 2 domain , WH2 ) , the cofilin - homology domain ( C , also known as central domain ) , and the acidic ( A ) domain . These are collectively referred to as the VCA module , and it is responsible for the binding of the Arp2 / 3 complex and one molecule of monomeric actin , thus constituting the region that directly enables actin nucleation ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ; Machesky et al . , 1999 ) . The main structural difference between the two WASP - proteins is that N - WASP has two WH2 domains whereas WASP has one . There are conflicting opinions about the functional significance of this . One study found that it was inducing the faster rate of Arp2 / 3 - induced actin assembly of N - WASP ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2000 ) , but was later contradicted ( Zalevsky et al . , 2001 ) . It is believed that the activity of the VCA module in WASP and N - WASP is regulated via an autoinhibitory loop where it folds back onto the N - terminus , and it is thus masked for actin and Arp2 / 3 ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . The other four domains of WASP and N - WASP bind various partners and regulate the actin polymerization in response to up - stream signaling events . In the N - terminus there is a Wiskott - Aldrich homology 1 ( WH1 ) domain , followed by a basic region , a GTPase - binding domain ( GBD , also known as CRIB - domain , Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding ) and an extended proline - rich region ( see Figure 2 ) . Activation by Cdc42 and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 The autoinhibitory loop is opened up when activated GTP - bound Cdc42 binds to the GBD ( Miki et al . , 1998a ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . In this way Cdc42 controls the actin - polymerizing activity of WASP and N - WASP in response to extracellular signals such as growth factors . Cdc42 is a small GTPase that induces filopodia ( Kozma et al . , 1995 ; Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) . There are data indicating that WASP also weakly binds to another small GTPase , Rac1 , traditionally associated with lamellipodia ( Aspenstrom et al . , 1996 ) . Additionally , binding of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) to the adjacent basic region aids in opening up the folded - back configuration ( Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ; Prehoda et al . , 2000 ; Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ) . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is located in the cell surface plasma membrane and recruits and regulates many actin - binding proteins besides WASP and N - WASP , such as gelsolin , cofilin , vinculin and ezrin ( Janmey and Lindberg , 2004 ) . The polyproline domain will bind to SH3 - domain - containing protein such as Grb2 , WISH , and Nck , and this will also lead to Arp2 / 3 - activation . However , the precise mechanism remains unclear and there are many potential binding partners at this site 8 ( Carlier et al . , 2000 ; Fukuoka et al . , 2001 ; Rohatgi et al . , 2001 ) . For example , a large number of membrane - deforming proteins , known as F - BAR / EFC proteins , have recently been shown to interact with N - WASP via the SH3 - domain , thus coupling membrane dynamics and actin polymerization ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . The WH1 domain The WH1 domain interacts with three proteins collectively known as the verprolins : WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) ( Ramesh et al . , 1997 ) , corticosteroid and regional expression - 16 ( CR16 ) ( Ho et al . , 2001 ) , and WIP - related ( WIRE , also known as WIP - and CR16 - homologous protein ( WICH ) ) ( Aspenstrom , 2002 ; Kato et al . , 2002 ) . The WH1 domain is often classified together with the Ena - VASP - homology - 1 ( EVH1 ) domain due to structural similarity ( Callebaut et al . , 1998 ; Symons et al . , 1996 ) . However , the binding of verprolins to the WH1 domain is exclusive and the molecular binding motifs are specific ( Peterson et al . , 2007 ; Zettl and Way , 2002 ) . Figure 2 N - WASP with its interacting partners . Adapted from ( Bompard and Caron , 2004 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) 1 . 3 . 4 The verprolins There are three actin - regulating proteins that constitute the mammalian verprolin family that bind to WASP and N - WASP in the WH1 domain : WIP , CR16 , and WIRE ( Aspenstrom , 2002 ; Ho et al . , 2001 ; Kato et al . , 2002 ; Ramesh et al . , 1997 ; Weiler et al . , 1996 ) . They all bind to both filamentous ( F - ) actin and to monomeric ( G - ) actin ( Ho et al . , 2001 ; Kato et al . , 2002 ; Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2001 ) . WIP and WIRE are ubiquitously expressed , whereas CR16 expression is restricted to brain , heart , lung , and colon ( Aspenstrom , 2002 ; Kato et al . , 2002 ; Ramesh et al . , 1997 ; Weiler et al . , 1996 ) . They are all homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Verprolin , initially identified as a regulator of actin filament formation and endocytosis ( Donnelly et al . , 1993 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ) . Verprolin binds to the yeast WASP homologue Las17 / Bee1 , showing that the verprolin - WASP interaction is evolutionary conserved ( Naqvi et al . , 1998 ) . WIP and WASP WIP is the member which has been most extensively studied . It binds to the WH1 domain via a C - terminal WASP - binding domain ( WBD ) ( Peterson et al . , 2007 ; Volkman et al . , 2002 ) . It has been estimated that more than 95 % of WASP in lymphocytes is bound to WIP ( Sasahara et al . , 2002 ) , and most of the mutations 9 associated with the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome are located to the WH1 domain , suggesting that the WASP - WIP complex is essential for immune function , possibly since the complex appears to protect WASP from protease degradation . ( Lutskiy et al . , 2005 ) . Other functions of WIP Also N - WASP is mostly found in a complex with WIP ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2001 ) . WIP interaction keeps N - WASP in the autoinhibited state and stabilizes the protein . In this way WIP acts as an inhibitor of N - WASP activity , however , in other aspects WIP seems to promote microfilament formation : overexpression of WIP in lymphoid cells induces actin polymerization and cell surface projections ( Ramesh et al . , 1997 ) , and microinjection of anti - WIP antiserum inhibits filopodia formation by N - WASP ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2001 ) . Additionally , WIP shuttles WASP to areas of actin assembly in the T cell immunological synapse by binding to adaptor protein CrkL ( Sasahara et al . , 2002 ) . Moreover , the WIP - WASP complex has been implicated in NK cell function ( Krzewski et al . , 2006 ) , where WIP also seems to have a function independently of WASP ( Krzewski et al . , 2008 ) . Indeed , the WASP - independent function of WIP is just beginning to emerge , for instance the inflammatory disorder displayed by WIP - / - mice is more severe than that of WASP - / - mice ( Curcio et al . , 2007 ; Snapper et al . , 1998 ) , it has also been demonstrated that WIP mutants unable to bind WASP still induce filopodia formation in response to PDGF stimulation ( Aspenstrom , 2004 ) . In fact , WIP binds to another Arp2 / 3 - activating protein , cortactin via its SH3 domain , and cooperates in the formation of membrane protrusions ( Kinley et al . , 2003 ) . The identification of mini - WIP , a splice form that lacks the C - terminal WASP - binding domain , is also suggesting WASP - independent functions of WIP ( Koduru et al . , 2007 ) . WIRE and CR16 WIRE and CR16 are the two other verprolin family members . WIRE binds to both N - WASP and WASP at the WH1 domain ( Aspenstrom , 2002 ; Kato et al . , 2002 ) . CR16 has so far been shown to form a complex with N - WASP in brain and testis ( Ho et al . , 2001 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2007 ) , but there are few studies to date investigating CR16 . WIRE relocalizes WASP to actin filaments via direct interaction , and ectopically expressed WIRE has been shown to produce filopodia and lamellipodia downstream of PDGF stimulation ( Aspenstrom , 2002 ) . It has also been suggested that WIRE is an actin - bundling protein , since ectopical expression will induce thick actin fibers ( Kato and Takenawa , 2005 ) . Both WIP and WIRE in complex with WASP have recently been shown to play an important role in chemotaxis of monocytes ( Tsuboi , 2006 ) . Further , WIP and WIRE probably have more actin - related functions since they both bind to cortactin , profilin , and Nck ( Anton et al . , 1998 ; Aspenstrom , 2002 ; Kinley et al . , 2003 ; Ramesh et al . , 1997 ) . 1 . 4 ENDOCYTOSIS Endocytosis is the uptake of extracellular material into the cell by membrane invagination and its internalization in a membrane - bound vesicle . This process controls what enters the cell , and once internalized the cargo is sorted and transported to a suitable cellular destination . Endocytosis is crucial for many biological processes such 10 as the immune response , nutrient uptake , development , neurotransmission , intercellular communication , signal transduction and cellular homeostasis . Generally , one differentiates between phagocytosis , the uptake of large particles , and pinocytosis , the uptake of fluid and solutes . Pinocytosis is carried out via four basic mechanisms : macropinocytosis , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , caveolae - mediated endocytosis , and the poorly defined clathrin - and caveolae - independent endocytosis ( Conner and Schmid , 2003 ) . 1 . 4 . 1 Entry by pinocytosis Macropinocytosis enables the cell to sample large volumes of the extracellular milieu . It involves membrane protrusions that are created by actin polymerization that then fuse to form large endocytic vesicles . The internalized material then passes through early endosomes and is either recycled back to the plasma membrane or continues to the late endosomal compartment and lysosomes where degradation takes place . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis The major pathway of selective receptor internalization in higher eukaryotes is via small clathrin - coated pits at the cell membrane ( Ungewickell and Hinrichsen , 2007 ) . The process occurs constitutively in mammalian cells . It has been estimated that a fibroblast will internalize membrane equivalent of its total surface area in one hour ( Bretscher , 1982 ) . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) involves the concentration of transmembrane receptors and their bound ligands into patches of the plasma membrane . These patches can be 10 to 500 nm in diameter ( Heuser , 1980 ) and they contain clathrin , adaptors and endocytic accessory proteins . It takes from 50 to 150 s for a clathrin - coated pit to assemble and to pinch off as a coated vesicle ( Bellve et al . , 2006 ; Merrifield et al . , 2005 ) . Clathrin is a tri - legged trimer ( a triskelion ) which can self - Figure 3 Overview of the means of entry into the cell . Modified from ( Conner and Schmid , 2003 ) assemble into spherical polyhedral lattices ( Fotin et al . , 2004 ) thus shaping the invaginating membrane . However , clathrin needs adaptor proteins to connect to the 11 plasma membrane . The main adaptor AP - 2 is a four subunit complex that has a barrel - shaped core and two protruding ear - shaped appendages . AP - 2 binds to phosphatidylinositol phosphates , specifically phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate in the cell membrane ( Collins et al . , 2002 ; Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ; Padron et al . , 2003 ) . AP - 2 will further direct clathrin assembly into curved lattices and couple it to cargo recruitment ( Brodsky et al . , 2001 ; Kirchhausen , 1999 ) . Although clathrin is essential for the invagination of the coated structure , it is not sufficient on its own ( Hinrichsen et al . , 2006 ) . Accessory proteins such as members of the ENTH and BAR and F - BAR / EFC protein families are known to induce , sense , and stabilize membrane curvature ( Ford et al . , 2002 ; Gallop et al . , 2006 ; Masuda et al . , 2006 ) . F - BAR / EFC proteins are required for endocytosis of transferrin and EGF ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Tsujita et al . , 2006 ) and can also recruit N - WASP and thus initiate local actin polymerization . Actin in endocytosis The contribution of actin in clathrin - mediated endocytosis has been studied extensively in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , where it is needed for vesicle invagination ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) but has only recently been appreciated in higher eukaryotes after the advent of fluorescence live cell imaging techniques ( Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ; Ungewickell and Hinrichsen , 2007 ) , although it was first indicated already in 1980 ( Salisbury et al . , 1980 ) . It has been shown that bursts in actin polymerization occur in 80 % of the internalizing clathrin - coated pits ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ) . However , in contrast to the studies of yeast , in mammalian cells it appears that actin is not required for invagination but rather for the scission of the vesicle from the plasma membrane ( Yarar et al . , 2005 ) . The main mediator of vesicle scission is the GTPase dynamin which forms a ring around the neck of the pit ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ) . Also recruited are N - WASP , Arp2 / 3 ( Benesch et al . , 2005 ) , actin ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ) and the actin - binding protein cortactin ( Le Clainche et al . , 2007 ) . Thus actin could supply the force needed to constrict the neck of the vesicle and enable scission . Alternatively , myosin motors have been located to the vesicle neck , and these could produce a strain by pulling in opposite directions ( Ungewickell and Hinrichsen , 2007 ) . As the endocytic vesicle buds of from the plasma membrane it also sheds it clathrin - coat . Caveolin - dependent endocytosis In caveolin - dependent endocytosis flask - shaped invaginations known as caveolae are formed in membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids ( Anderson , 1998 ) . The most abundant structural components are oligomers of caveolin - 1 that are believed to shape the caveolae ( Fernandez et al . , 2002 ) . Dynamin and dynamic rearrangements of microfilaments are also needed in caveolin - dependent endocytosis . However , caveolae differ from clathrin - coated vesicles in many ways : they are very slowly internalized , ( their half - time is more than 20 min ) , the vesicles are small ( 50 - 60 nm ) , and their cargo is different ( Conner and Schmid , 2003 ) . Known caveolar ligands are simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) ( Anderson et al . , 1996 ; Stang et al . , 1997 ) and Cholera toxin ( Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ; Parton et al . , 1994 ) . The cellular fate of the vesicle after budding , of the caveosome , also seems different than that of clathrin coated vesicles , as will be briefly discussed below . 12 1 . 4 . 2 Sorting for recycling or degradation Incoming vesicles merge with each other and with pre - existing early endosomes . Early endosomes , sometimes also referred to as sorting endosomes , are tubular - vesicular structures with a luminal pH of ~ 6 . 0 ( Maxfield and McGraw , 2004 ) . The pH is established via the action of a membrane - bound proton pump , the V - ATPase , which is also present on late endosomes and lysosomes ( Galloway et al . , 1983 ) . The cargo delivered to early endosomes is either returned to the plasma membrane or passed on to lysosomes via late endosomes . There is also communication of biosynthesized molecules with the trans - Golgi network . The major sorting task during endocytosis is to separate membrane from contents in the incoming vesicles . Since large quantities of membrane are constitutively internalized , there must be an efficient process to return this to the cell surface . Receptors that are positioned in the membrane can also be recycled , after their ligands have been dissociated due to the lower pH in the early endosomes ( Pattni and Stenmark , 2006 ) . Recycling routes Cargo destined for recycling can return to the plasma membrane via two routes , either rapidly from early endosomes , or via recycling endosomes . Recycling endosomes are highly tubular , perinuclear structures that rarely contain fluid - dissolved macromolecules ( Mellman , 1996 ; Yamashiro et al . , 1984 ) . The “recycling part” of early endosomes and recycling endosomes has a pronounced tubular architecture with a high membrane - to - volume - ratio , thus ensuring enrichment of membrane over soluble content . Rapid recycling of receptors and membrane by budding takes place from the early endosomes ( 3 - 4 min ) while receptors that reach recycling endosomes require longer time to return the plasma membrane ( 20 - 30 min ) ( Hopkins , 1983 ; Sheff et al . , 1999 ) . The recycling is controlled by the small GTPases Rab4 in early endosomes and Rab11 in recycling endosomes ( Zerial and McBride , 2001 ) . Indeed , the majority of receptor recycling , probably more than 65 % , goes straight from early endosomes to the plasma membrane ( Sheff et al . , 1999 ) . Transcytosis Transcytosis is a specialized form of recycling in polarized cells where cargo is shuttled between the apical and the basolateral surface . These cells control selective recycling by recognizing the same cytoplasmic and luminal sorting signals on basolateral and apical proteins as is used in the secretory pathway ( Matter et al . , 1993 ) ( Aroeti and Mostov , 1994 ; Mellman , 2006 ) . Most recycling will be directed to the original surface compartment , but there is also the transcytic delivery of cargo such as immunoglobulin receptors in epithelia ( Maxfield and McGraw , 2004 ) . Endosome maturation Early endosomes accept incoming vesicles for about 5 - 10 minutes , then they lose their tubular extensions , translocate along microtubules and become increasingly acidic . This is part of the maturation process into late endosomes , which also involves acquiring acid hydrolases ( Gur et al . , 2006 ; Maxfield and McGraw , 2004 ) . The cargo that remain in the endosomes , such as fluid - phase particles and some receptors , are destined for lysosomal degradation . A means to down - regulate receptors such as growth factor receptors is to target them for degradation after activation and internalization . Mono - or multi - ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic portion of a receptor is a dominant signal for 13 degradative protein sorting ( Haglund et al . , 2003 ; Hicke and Dunn , 2003 ; Mosesson et al . , 2003 ; Reggiori and Pelham , 2001 ) . However , while luminal content of the endosome is directly accessible to lysosomal degradation , receptors in the membrane require the formation of intraluminal vesicles . These are formed by the sequential action of four distinct protein complexes known as ESCRT ( endosomal sorting complex required for transport ) 0 to III ( Babst , 2005 ) . It starts when Hrs , a constituent of ESCRT - 0 , is recruited to the endosomal membrane via its binding to membrane component phosphatidyl inositol 3 - phosphate , and then recognizes the ubiquitylated receptor ( Bilodeau et al . , 2002 ; Misra and Hurley , 1999 ; Shih et al . , 2002 ) . The ubiquitin is shed before budding into the endosome proceeds by unclear actions of the ESCORT complexes ( Hurley and Emr , 2006 ; Williams and Urbe , 2007 ) . Late endosomes With the formation of the intraluminal vesicles the early endosome has matured into a multivesicular body ( MVB ) , also known as late endosome . Furthermore , the late endosome has lost the early endosomal key regulatory protein Rab5 and recruited its late endosomal counterpart Rab7 . The transition from early to late endosomes is characterized by many fusion and fission events between early endosomes . Gradually degradative cargo accumulates in fewer and bigger endosomes , and the Rab5 to Rab7 - conversion then enables fusion events with late endosomes ( Rink et al . , 2005 ) . There is , however , still controversy in the field regarding the nature of early to late endosome transition . An alternative scenario of early to late endosomal transition would be that the cargo is delivered from early endosomes by transport vesicles that fuse with pre - existing late endosomes ( Aniento et al . , 1993 ; Gruenberg et al . , 1989 ) . Lysosomes There has also been controversy regarding the transition of late endosomes to lysosomes ; whether it proceeds via a maturation model or a carrier vesicle model . However , today there is good evidence that late endosomes fuse directly with lysosomes ( Bright et al . , 1997 ; Futter et al . , 1996 ; Mullock et al . , 1998 ; Ward et al . , 2000 ) . The organelles will transiently fuse , “kissing” , or undergo permanent fusion , where kissing often precedes full fusion . Additionally , contents are sometimes mixed by protruding tubules ( Bright et al . , 2005 ) . However , little is known about what “prepares” a late endosome to merge with a lysosome ( Luzio et al . , 2007 ) . After fusion a hybrid organelle is formed which contains all lysosomal enzymes . It is in this compartment that the actual degradation of endocytosed macromolecules takes place . It is probable that lysosomes are , fundamentally , storage compartments for lysosomal enzymes , and that it is with the fusion of late endosomes that these come to use ( Griffiths , 1996 ; Luzio et al . , 2007 ) . Lysosomes are then re - formed from the hybrid organelle by maturation processes . 1 . 4 . 3 Endosomes as regulators of signaling programs Early endosomes are important in regulating receptor signaling since they represent the site where the decision to degrade or recycle the receptors is made . However , additional ways in which endosomes are of importance are beginning to emerge . Internalized receptors can still be active , and thus spatial and temporal regulation of signaling can be controlled at the level of the endosome ( Polo et al . , 2006 ) . Spatial regulation is apparent 14 in the case of NGF and its receptor TrkA ( Howe et al . , 2001 ) . If receptor - ligand complex occurs at the tip of the axon , the complex has to be transported by endocytosis to the cell body in order to achieve modification of gene transcription . Additionally it seems like some receptors require internalization for the signaling to occur . Signaling by the Notch receptor in Drosophila requires endocytosis , both for signaling in the Notch expressing cell , as well as for the neighboring cell expressing the transmembrane ligand ( Le Borgne et al . , 2005 ; Seugnet et al . , 1997 ) . Some receptors can be internalized by different endocytic routes , and this has been shown to be one way of regulation . The TGF (cid:533) R is internalized through both clathrin - coated pits and caveolae . CME leads to increased receptor signaling from early endosomes , while the caveolar pathway causes rapid receptor degradation ( Di Guglielmo et al . , 2003 ) . Routing an activated receptor to clathrin - independent internalization could be an effective way to down - regulate signaling in the presence of excess ligand . The example of EGFR demonstrates this : when stimulated with low doses of ligand , EGFRs are almost exclusively internalized by CME . At higher doses a shift occurs when there is also use of the clathrin - independent pathway , which leads to ubiquitination and degradation ( Sigismund et al . , 2008 ; Sigismund et al . , 2005 ) . 1 . 4 . 4 Regulation of endocytic trafficking The endocytic system is characterized by constant membrane remodeling , which can be described as continuous fusion and fission events linked into a network in time ( Rink et al . , 2005 ) . These processes are tightly regulated , and they require the organization of the organelle membranes into functional domains . The above mentioned small GTPases of the Rab family have been recognized as the key regulators of membrane trafficking . Rabs There are more than 60 members of the Rab family and they regulate virtually all membrane trafficking steps within the secretory and endocytic pathways , such as formation of vesicles , motility along cytoskeletal filaments and docking and fusion with target membranes ( Miaczynska and Zerial , 2006 ) . Rabs are membrane - anchored proteins that cycle between active GTP - bound form and inactive GDP - bound form controlled by GDP / GTP - exchange factors ( GEFs ) and GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) . The active Rabs will interact with specific effector proteins , and thus exercise control of downstream processes . Rab proteins are restricted to specific intracellular compartments and have thus been used as organelle markers ( see Figure 4 ) . The Rabs are often located within distinct domains on the same organelle . Examples are early endosomes where cargo destined for degradation is located with Rab5 , and cargo which is to be recycled with Rab4 and Rab11 . Transferrin , which is recycled , has been shown by light microscopy to first colocalize with Rab5 , and then Rab4 and Rab11 ( Sonnichsen et al . , 2000 ) . Similarly , in late endosomes Rab7 - enriched domains direct cargo to degradation in lysosomes whereas Rab9 - domains regulate transport with the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) ( Barbero et al . , 2002 ) . Rab proteins exert their effect by a large number of effector proteins and by mediating local changes in membrane composition via interaction with lipid - modifying enzymes . 15 Figure 4 Overview of the endocytic compartments . Adapted from ( Maxfield and McGraw , 2004 ; Miaczynska and Zerial , 2006 ; Vicinanza et al . , 2008 ) Rab5 One of the best studied Rabs is Rab5 which is located to early endosomes and clathrin - coated vesicles ( Bucci et al . , 1992 ) . Rab5 has been shown to be able to interact with over 30 proteins ( Christoforidis et al . , 1999a ; Christoforidis and Zerial , 2000 ) , one of its main functions being to control homotypic endosome fusion , and docking of incoming clathrin - coated vesicles ( Bucci et al . , 1992 ; Gorvel et al . , 1991 ) . Rab5 activates phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) thus initiating the local production of membrane lipid phosphatidyl inositol 3 phosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 ) P ) ( Christoforidis et al . , 1999b ) which further recruits effector proteins such as EEA1 ( Simonsen et al . , 1998 ) . EEA1 is crucial for endosome tethering and docking ( Christoforidis et al . , 1999a ) via interaction with the SNARE machinery ( McBride et al . , 1999 ) . SNAREs SNAREs ( soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor ) are a family of membrane - tethered coiled - coil proteins that are central players in membrane fusion ( Jahn and Scheller , 2006 ; Martens and McMahon , 2008 ) . These proteins undergo an assembly - disassembly cycle , and when appropriate SNAREs are combined they form a stable (cid:302) - helical bundle , the SNARE complex ( Fasshauer et al . , 1997 ) . It is composed of four (cid:302) - helices that come from three or four different SNAREs , situated on the two opposing membranes ( Antonin et al . , 2002 ; Sutton et al . , 1998 ) . The assembly of the complex pulls the membranes together , to the point where they can fuse . The SNARE - complex formation releases energy , and it has been proposed that this energy is transduced though the transmembrane domains into the lipid bilayers , thus causing membrane destabilization that enables fusion ( Li et al . , 2007 ; Martens and McMahon , 2008 ) . In vitro , the appropriate sets of SNAREs in mixed liposomes will 16 cause membrane fusions , although rather slowly ( McNew et al . , 2000 ; Schuette et al . , 2004 ; Weber et al . , 1998 ) . However , in vivo other molecules probably work in concert with the SNARE complex to trigger the fusion . Different combinations of SNAREs are likely to direct membrane fusions between different compartments , but it has been difficult to unequivocally assign these , especially in mammalian cells ( Brandhorst and Jahn , 2006 ) . Phosphatidylinositol phosphates Regulation of endosome function relies on recruiting the right effectors to the right place at the right time . This complex task is facilitated by the presence of integral membrane components , such as the phosphatidylinositol phosphates ( PIPs ) . They function as organelle markers that can be changed in order for the membrane compartment to take on a new identity . Phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ) is the basic building block for the PIPs , and the seven different variants are made by reversible phosphorylation on three sites on the inositol ring headgroup ( Vicinanza et al . , 2008 ) . Figure 5 Phosphatidylinositol . The three possible sites of phosphorylation are in position 3’ , 4’ , and 5’ on the inositol ring Through controlled recruitment and activation of different PI kinases and phosphatases PIPs are transformed , and thus also the membranes that they reside in . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is found at the plasma membrane where it sequentially promotes recruitment of the coat adaptors , dynamin and other components of the fissioning machinery and finally the actin - based machineries with e . g . N - WASP ( see section 1 . 3 . 3 ) ( Haucke , 2005 ) . In order for the vesicle to be released into the cell , the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 needs to be dephosphorylated . On early endosomes and in the intraluminal vesicles in MVBs , one finds PtdIns ( 3 ) P , which could be produced from PtdIns from the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . 17 PtdIns ( 3 ) P acts as a membrane organizer for the actions of e . g . the above described EEA1 and the ESCORT complexes . Target proteins will bind via PtdIns ( 3 ) P - binding domains , such as the FYVE and the PX domains ( Stenmark et al . , 2002 ) . As endosome maturation proceeds to late endosomes PtdIns ( 3 ) P is phosphorylated to PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 . Additionally , PtdIns ( 4 ) P is found at the Golgi complex ( Vicinanza et al . , 2008 ) . The PIPs work in concert with the Rab proteins ( and also other small GTPases ) , and they exhibit mutual regulatory feed - back loops : PIPs regulate membrane recruitment of GAPs and GEFs by direct binding , and in their turn Rabs control the action of many PIP - metabolizing enzymes ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Shin et al . , 2005 ; Wenk and De Camilli , 2004 ) . PIPs and Rabs also work as co - receptor in the recruitment of specific cytosolic proteins . 1 . 4 . 5 Transport of endocytic vesicles The movement of endocytic vesicles is either based on microtubules or actin filaments . In animal cells microtubules are used for long - range movement , and actin filaments for short - range transport ( Rogers and Gelfand , 2000 ) . Dyneins and kinesins are the molecular motors employed on microtubules , and myosins are used for actin - filament movement . Myosins could drive initial movement through the actin - rich cell cortex before the switch to microtubules . For short - range movements endosomes can also harness the power of de novo actin polymerization to propel themselves ( Soldati and Schliwa , 2006 ) . Movement with molecular motors Both plus - end and minus - end directed molecular motors have a role in vesicle movement , since endosomes are frequently observed to move bidirectionally , in particular in the late endosomal stage ( Gross , 2004 ) . The rationale for this “jerking” motion is not clear but several functional explanations have been proposed : to keep the vesicles dispersed in the cytoplasm ( Brown et al . , 2005 ) , to enable fusion between different compartments ( Harrison et al . , 2003 ) , or to facilitate fission ( Bananis et al . , 2003 ) . The motor proteins can associate with its cargo either directly via non - motor domains or via accessory proteins . The most common mechanism is via scaffolding complexes . Dynein is an example which needs the phospholipid - binding dynactin for cargo association ( Schroer , 2004 ) . Rabs have been found to regulate the recruitment of both actin and microtubule molecular motors to membranes ( Caviston and Holzbaur , 2006 ) . Bidirectional movement of early endosomes along microtubules in vitro was found to depend on Rab5 ( Nielsen et al . , 1999 ) . For late endosomes in vitro , these were seen to move primarily toward the minus end of microtubules and to bind Rab7 ( Bananis et al . , 2004 ) . Rab5 also seems to regulate switching from actin - to microtubule - based motility . The Rab5 - effector HAP40 will recruit Huntingtin to early endosomes which favors interaction with actin rather than microtubules . However , as Rab5 - bound GTP is hydrolyzed , HAP40 is released while Huntingtin remains and now recruits binding partners for microtubule - based movement , such as dynein or HAP1 which binds directly to dynactin and kinesin ( Caviston et al . , 2007 ; Engelender et al . , 1997 ; McGuire et al . , 2006 ; Pal et al . , 2006 ) . 18 Movement by actin rocketing The requirement for actin polymerization in the transport of endosomes is beginning to be established , just as it has been in the formation of the endocytic vesicle . It was previously known that invading bacteria such as Shigella or Listeria , or Vaccinia virus , could use the actin polymerization machinery to move intracellularly , displaying “actin comet tails” ( see section 1 . 5 . 2 ) . But the first observation of tails on the cells own organelles was in 1999 when Frischknecht et al in a study of Vaccinia tails also observed tail - like actin structures on clathrin - coated vesicles in Xenopus egg extracts ( Frischknecht et al . , 1999 ) . In the same year Merrifield et al reported actin tails on endocytic vesicles from mast cells ( Merrifield et al . , 1999 ) . Since then similar structures have been reported in different systems ( Girao et al . , 2008 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2000 ; Taunton et al . , 2000 ) . The driving force appears to be by the Arp2 / 3 complex , and members of the WASP - family have been reported to localize to the vesicles ( Benesch et al . , 2002 ; Chang et al . , 2003 ; Taunton et al . , 2000 ) . Additionally , it has been shown that the recruitment and activation of WASP and N - WASP to these vesicles involved WIP ( Benesch et al . , 2002 ) . 1 . 4 . 6 Phagocytosis and autophagy In mammals it is mainly specialized cells such as macrophages and neutrophils that ingest extracellular matter by phagocytosis , but it can also occur in other cells . Internalized objects are for example bacteria or yeast , or cell debris and apoptotic bodies . The mechanism involves specific cell - surface receptors and actin polymerization that enable large membrane extensions that engulf the particle . After the particle is internalized it is confined to a membrane - bound structure known as the phagosome . Just as endosomes , phagosomes sequentially acquire different proteins , such as Rabs , that enable maturation and acidification ( Smith et al . , 2007 ) . One of the earliest maturation events is the recruitment of Rab5 , followed by PtdIns ( 3 ) P and then Rab7 . Eventually the phagosome fuses with lysosomes for full degradation of its cargo ( Kinchen and Ravichandran , 2008 ) . In cells like macrophages and dendritic cells this results in the generation of peptide antigens that are loaded onto MHC molecules and presented at the cell surface ( Ramachandra et al . , 2008 ) . When the internalized particle is a bacterium , the phagosomal processing should end in destruction and elimination . However , pathogens have found ways to escape into the cytoplasm ( see section 1 . 5 ) . These bacteria then have to face another line of defense : autophagy . Autophagy is a conserved pathway that sequesters cytoplasmic material and delivers it to lysosomes for degradation . This is important for recycling of nutrients and disposal of organelles . However , this system is also used for degradation of cytoplasmic bacteria , although the triggering signals remain unclear . When a bacterium is targeted for destruction by autophagy the resident autophagy compartment wraps itself around it and elongates until it is sealed into a double - membrane bound structure known as the phagophore . This process is executed by a ubiquitin - like conjugation system controlled by the Atg proteins . Fusion with lysosomes then creates the autolysosome in which degradation is completed ( Sanjuan and Green , 2008 ) . 19 1 . 5 BACTERIAL INVASION The sophisticated endocytic system is designed to exert control over the traffic into the cell . However , pathogens have found ways to use it for their own purposes . To evade immunosurveillance , pathogens such as Salmonella and Shigella enter into cells and then use the cell as a shelter for propagation . In contrast to the phagocytosis by phagocytes , where the bacteria is passive , the pathogen in bacterial – induced phagocytosis is actively manipulating the entry system into cells such as the intestinal epithelial cells of the gut ( Cossart and Sansonetti , 2004 ) . 1 . 5 . 1 Strategies of entry There are two main strategies that a bacterium can use to invade a non - phagocytic cell , the zippering mechanism and the triggering mechanism . They both involve initial contact with the host cell followed by membrane protrusions and cytoskeletal remodeling that causes the bacterium to be caught and internalized . In the zippering model the membrane protrusions are less dramatic than in the triggering process . The zippering process also makes use of host endocytic proteins such as clathrin and dynamin , which does not seem to be the case for triggering entry ( Veiga et al . , 2007 ) . Zippering entry Yersinia and Listeria use the zippering mechanism . Here transmembrane cell - adhesion proteins are used as receptors for entry . For Listeria its two proteins internalinA ( InlA ) and InlB bind to the host E - cadherin and hepatocyte growth factor receptor ( Met ) ( Cossart and Veiga , 2008 ) . In Yersinia the protein is invasin , and it binds to (cid:533) 1 - integrin receptors ( Fallman and Gustavsson , 2005 ) . The binding leads to Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization , in the case of Yersinia via N - WASP action ( McGee et al . , 2001 ) and for Listeria probably both via Rac - activated WAVE1 and WAVE2 , and Cdc42 - activated N - WASP ( Seveau et al . , 2007 ) . The cell membrane wraps tightly around the bacterium and encloses it into a vacuole . However , it should be noted that the biological significance of Yersinia entry in epithelial cells is uncertain . The usual entry route for Yersinia in the intestine is via M - cells over Peyer’s patches ( Shao , 2008 ) . Triggering entry In the triggering mechanism the bacteria manipulates the host cell by delivery of effector proteins via the type three secretion system ( T3SS ) . The T3SS is a syringe - like structure that assembles on the bacterial surface and which upon contact with the host cell membrane triggers translocation of bacterially pre - stored effectors ( Cornelis and Van Gijsegem , 2000 ) . These effectors instigate major rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton which manifest in cell extensions raising several micrometers that engulf the bacterium into a large vacuole ( Galan , 2001 ) . For Salmonella , the bacterial effectors SopE and SptP acts as GEFs and GAPs toward Cdc42 and Rac thus triggering the process ( Galan , 2001 ) . For Shigella activation of Rac and Cdc42 is indirect via its effectors IpaC and IpgB1 . Also , Shigella invasion will recruit cortactin in a Src - dependent manner ( Nhieu et al . , 2005 ; Rottner et al . , 2005 ) . 20 1 . 5 . 2 Intracellular lifestyle Once inside the cell , the pathogens strategies diverge . The default program of the phagosome is to undergo maturation toward lysosomal degradation , and the bacteria have different mechanisms to avoid this . They can either block the phagosomal maturation and reside and multiply inside the organelle , or they can destroy the vacuole and escape into the cytoplasm ( Gruenberg and van der Goot , 2006 ) . Salmonella stays in the phagosome , and modifies it to become a Salmonella - containing vacuole ( SCV ) . The first step is to produce a phosphoinositide phosphatase , SopB , that preferentially removes the 5 - phosphate of PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 and the 4 - phosphate of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) 3 ( Marcus et al . , 2001 ) . This leads to sustained PtdIns ( 3 ) P production on the SCV , and SopB thereby alters trafficking to prevent further maturation ( Hernandez et al . , 2004 ) . The SCV is neither a late nor an early endosome ( Holden , 2002 ) and it will transiently acquire Rab5 , PI3 - kinase , EEA1 and finally Rab7 ( Meresse et al . , 1999 ) . Shortly after invasion the SCV migrates to the perinuclear region close to the MTOC where it associates with the Golgi ( Salcedo and Holden , 2003 ) . This movement takes place via microtubules and the Rab7 - interacting lysosomal protein ( RILP ) which associates with dynein ( Cantalupo et al . , 2001 ; Harrison et al . , 2003 ; Jordens et al . , 2001 ) . The SCV is then maintained in its position by the action of the effector SifA which via SifA - and kinesin - interacting protein ( SKIP ) prevents the recruitment of kinesin ( Boucrot et al . , 2005 ) . SifA is also required for the formation of Sifs , tubular extensions of the SCV of disputed function ( Garcia - del Portillo et al . , 1993 ) . Other invasive bacteria such as Listeria and Shigella escape the phagosome , replicate in the cytosol and move by hijacking the cell’s actin polymerization machinery ( Cossart and Sansonetti , 2004 ) . Twenty minutes after internalization Listeria monocytogenes escapes the vacuole by secretion of listeriolysin O ( LLO ) which generates transmembrane pores in cholesterol - containing membranes in an acidic environment ( Myers et al . , 2003 ; Tweten , 2005 ) . The Shigella mechanism of vacuole escape is less clear but appears to depend on the action of effector IpaB ( Cossart and Sansonetti , 2004 ) . Once free in the cytoplasm both Shigella and Listeria take control of the cells Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization to create force for movement . From one pole of the bacteria surface protein ActA ( Listeria ) or IcsA ( Shigella ) is expressed ( Goldberg and Theriot , 1995 ; Kocks et al . , 1993 ) . ActA mimics the C - terminal VCA module of the WASPs and thus directly recruits the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin monomers ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) ( Boujemaa - Paterski et al . , 2001 ) . IcsA of Shigella will instead recruit cellular N - WASP and with it actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Egile et al . , 1999 ; Suzuki et al . , 1998 ) . The result is fast intracellular movement of the bacteria , manifest by prominent actin tails , which can generate the force for cell - to - cell spread in the epithelial cell layer . Movement is also a strategy to avoid degradation by the autophagy route . In Listeria the rate of movement is estimated to be 10 - 87 (cid:80) m / min and in Shigella 3 - 26 (cid:80) m / min ( Stevens et al . , 2006 ) . 1 . 6 INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract . Its two major forms are ulcerative colitis ( UC ) and Crohn’s 21 disease ( CD ) . UC and CD differ in the location and type of inflammation . There is no pharmacological cure for IBD today ; treatment is solely to alleviate the symptoms . It is believed to be elicited by an abnormal inflammatory reaction to the resident gut flora in genetically susceptible individuals . Although UC and CD manifest themselves as different diseases , it can clinically be difficult to tell the difference . Therefore a subgroup of the IBD patients are diagnosed as having “indeterminate colitis” . 1 . 6 . 1 Clinical features IBD represents a major burden of morbidity in Western countries . The prevalence in North America and Europe range from 21 to 246 per 100 000 for UC and 8 to 214 per 100 000 for CD ( Loftus , 2004 ) . The typical disease development for IBD is reoccurring attacks with more or less symptom - free remissions . Although great hope is raised for development of new therapeutic agents , the standard regimen is still corticosteroids for acute flares and 5 - ASA for maintenance of remission . Surgery is the only resort for full - blown disease . For longstanding , extensive inflammation in UC patients , there is a significant risk of colorectal cancer , up to 40 % lifetime risk ( Ekbom et al . , 1990 ) . 1 . 6 . 2 Disease pathogenesis The key feature in IBD pathogenesis appears to be an imbalance between microbes and host defensive responses at the mucosal epithelial barrier . Inflammation in CD can include the whole gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus . It is patch - wise and intramural and may give rise to fistulas and stenosis . It is characterized by aggregation of macrophages that frequently form granulomas . The pathogenesis of UC shows a different pattern , the inflammation is mucosal and constrained to the colon ; always starting at the rectum and extending proximally in a continuous fashion . Histopathological features include the presence of neutrophils within the lamina propria and the crypts , forming micro - abscesses . Symptoms common to both UC and CD are bloody feces and diarrhea . Some patients also suffer from extra - intestinal manifestations affecting the joints , eyes , skin , mouth , and liver ( Bouma and Strober , 2003 ; Xavier and Podolsky , 2007 ) . 1 . 6 . 3 Genetics and gene expression in IBD Epidemiological studies have revealed that the risk factors for IBD are both environmental and genetic , in an intricate interplay . Studies showed concordance rates for UC in monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs to be 6 - 18 % and 0 - 5 % . For CD monozygotic twins showed up to 58 % concordance while dizygotic twins had no higher risk than for other siblings . These results are indicative of genetic predisposition , especially in CD ( Orholm et al . , 2000 ; Thompson et al . , 1996 ; Tysk et al . , 1988 ) , and familial clustering further reveal genetic susceptibility ( Orholm et al . , 1991 ; Peeters et al . , 1996 ) . Susceptibility genes Nine IBD susceptibility loci have been identified and confirmed , however only one 22 gene has been identified with certainty , and this is the Nod2 gene which is an intracellular sensor of bacteria ( Muise and Rotin , 2008 ) . Nod2 appears to be specific to CD . On chromosome 5 polymorphisms in the OCTN1 and OCTN2 cation transporter genes have been proposed to be associated with CD ( Peltekova et al . , 2004 ) . A large number of candidate genes have been found in by linkage analysis or genome - wide association searches and by candidate gene approach , a selection of which are discussed below . TLR4 is an important sensor of LPS and thus pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity . It has been shown to be associated with both UC and CD , thus underlining the importance of microbial sensing , as also seen with Nod2 ( Oostenbrug et al . , 2005 ) . Two genes involved in autophagy have been associated with CD , ATG16L1 and IRGM ( Hampe et al . , 2007 ; Parkes et al . , 2007 ; Rioux et al . , 2007 ) . Further , IL23R polymorphism has been associated with both UC and CD ( Duerr et al . , 2006 ; Tremelling et al . , 2007 ) , in addition to other autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis and multiple sclerosis ( Burton et al . , 2007 ) . IL23R has been proposed to be involved in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and macrophages ( McGovern and Powrie , 2007 ) . Early on , the MHC complex was suggested to give an important contribution to IBD susceptibility and this association was again shown in a recent genome - wide association study of UC . Interestingly , this study also implicated the immunosuppressive cytokine IL - 10 and ARPC2 in UC susceptibility . ARPC2 is a component of the Arp2 / 3 complex , thus linking UC to fundamental disturbances in actin dynamics ( Franke et al . , 2008 ) . Interestingly , Arp2 / 3 is regulated by WASP , and the mouse WASP knock - out has UC - like colitis in addition to WAS - like disease ( Nguyen et al . , 2007 ) . Dysregulated pathways Global gene expression study is a powerful method to characterize the complex interaction of molecular players in IBD . Investigations of UC gene expression have identified some main dysregulated cellular pathways . These are epithelial barrier proteins , inflammatory and immune mediators , cell fate factors , and metabolism and ion transport . These were replicated in our study by use of the SSH methodology ( Paper I ) . We also identified proteins involved in membrane trafficking as a new small category . Langmann and colleagues have additionally found genes involved in cellular detoxification to be down - regulated in UC , this could be an aspect of down - regulation of genes involved in cellular metabolism and ion transport ( Langmann et al . , 2004 ) . An early study from 2001 performed with micro - arrays has shown the two IBD manifestations to have distinct , but partially overlapping , gene expression profiles ( Lawrance et al . , 2001 ) . Important differences include the differential expression of cancer - related genes in UC , consistent with the higher risk of colorectal cancer , as compared to CD . 1 . 6 . 4 Bacteria The microbiota and IBD The gut mucosal surfaces are characterized by a vast and complex ecosystem of commensal and symbiotic bacteria : 10 12 bacteria / g feces in the colon , consisting of 23 more than 400 different species ( Farrell and Peppercorn , 2002 ) . The inflammation in IBD is believed to be triggered by an aberrant immune response to the resident gut flora . It is known that IBD patients suffer from a higher colonization of bacteria at the epithelial cell lining and mucous layer ( Darfeuille - Michaud et al . , 1998 ; Macfarlane et al . , 2004 ; Schultsz et al . , 1999 ; Swidsinski et al . , 2002 ; Swidsinski et al . , 2005 ) . It is also clear that the parts of the GI tract most crowded with bacteria , the terminal ileum and colon , are also those more prone to develop inflammation ( Campieri and Gionchetti , 1999 ) . Additionally , antibiotic treatment has been observed to alleviate disease both in UC and CD ( Prantera , 2008 ) . The most compelling argument for a bacterial role in the disease comes from rodent models of IBD . Interleukin ( IL ) - 10 deficient mice or chemically treated rats will not develop IBD if raised under germ - free conditions ( Rath et al . , 1996 ; Sellon et al . , 1998 ) . Sensing of bacteria In 2001 Nod2 was identified as a susceptibility gene for CD ( Hampe et al . , 2001 ; Hugot et al . , 2001 ; Ogura et al . , 2001a ) . Nod2 senses intracellular bacteria by binding to the peptidoglycan component muramyl dipeptide , and its binding leads to activation of the pro - inflammatory regulator NF (cid:440) B ( Ogura et al . , 2001a ; Ogura et al . , 2001b ) . Since then a SNP in the autophagocytic gene ATG16L1 has been associated with CD ( Hampe et al . , 2007 ; Rioux et al . , 2007 ) , and also a second autophagy gene , IRGM ( Parkes et al . , 2007 ) . It has been proposed that Nod2 binding to cytoplasmic bacteria targets them for degradation through the autophagy pathway ( Sanjuan and Green , 2008 ) . These findings point to a dysregulated response to invasive bacteria , which could then lead to inappropriate immune reactions . 1 . 6 . 5 Epithelial integrity One of the hallmark characteristics of IBD is disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier , and a defective barrier is speculated to cause a loss of tolerance to the normal enteric flora . Indeed , abnormal intestinal permeability have been found in patients with Crohn’s ( Arnott et al . , 2000 ; Mankertz and Schulzke , 2007 ; Wyatt et al . , 1997 ; Wyatt et al . , 1993 ) prior to relapse , an even in some first - degree relatives to Crohn’s disease relatives , underlining the importance of the epithelial barrier in disease predisposition ( Buhner et al . , 2006 ; Irvine and Marshall , 2000 ) . The apical junctional complexes ( AJC ) between the epithelial cells that line the intestine are known to be dynamically regulated by cytokines , and expression analysis in IBD biopsies have revealed a downregulation of junctional complexes ( Gassler et al . , 2001 ) . Further , polymorphisms in several AJC genes have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD through disruption of the barrier defense ( Muise and Rotin , 2008 ) . 24 1 . 7 FK506 - BINDING PROTEINS The FK506 - binding proteins ( FKBPs ) are diverse family of proteins that exhibit various cellular functions such as apoptosis ( FKBP38 ) ( Shirane et al . , 2008 ) , regulation of steroid receptors ( FKBP52 and FKBP51 ) ( Davies and Sanchez , 2005 ) and stabilization of the ryanodine receptors in skeletal and cardiac tissue ( FKBP12 and FKBP12 . 6 ) ( Chelu et al . , 2004 ) . In humans there are 17 FKBPs described , but these proteins are found in all levels of life , also in bacteria . FKBPs can bind to and mediate the effects of the immosuppressant drugs FK506 ( Tacrolimus ) and rapamycin , and they are peptidyl - prolyl cis - trans isomerases ( PPIases ) . These two functions are mediated by the FKBP domain , and seem to depend on the same structural conformation , although the drug - binding is a gain - of - function , probably one of Nature’s coincidences ( Galat , 2004 ; Harrar et al . , 2001 ) . 25 2 AIMS OF THESIS Gene expression studies are powerful tools to get a global picture of pathological processes in cells and tissues . From this starting point our objective was to describe overall protein changes in ulcerative colitis and to find and characterize previous unknown players in the disease . The major finding of this project was the identification and characterization of novel protein WAFL : Specific aims : (cid:120) To investigate the differences in gene expression profile between inflamed vs . non - inflamed biopsies from ulcerative colitis patients . (cid:120) To identify novel genes that could be involved in ulcerative colitis pathogenesis (cid:120) To functionally and structurally characterize the novel gene WAFL 26 3 METHODOLOGICAL HIGHLIGHTS 3 . 1 SUBTRACTIVE SUPPRESSION HYBRIDIZATION ( SSH ) SSH is a method to selectively amplify differentially expressed cDNA between two populations , in our case between inflamed and non - inflamed tissue . The two cDNA populations are known as the tester ( the inflamed ) and the driver ( non - inflamed ) . The tester is divided into two pools that are tagged with different 5’adaptors . Each pool is then mixed with excess driver , denatured and allowed to hybridize . Single - stranded cDNAs will emerge from transcripts that are more abundant in the tester population . This stage functions as a normalization mechanism , since abundant cDNAs tend to homohybridize , with less abundant cDNAs more likely to stay single stranded . cDNAs common to both populations will form heterohybrids . The two hybridization reactions are mixed and more driver is added ( without denaturation ) . Thus single - stranded cDNA of the two pools can anneal . The resulting tester hybrids will have both kinds of 5’tags . The overhangs that these create are filled in , and these are then the sites for the primers in the subsequent PCR amplification step . Only the templates with both sites for both primers will be amplified exponentially . cDNAs from tester homohybrids will have the same site at both ends , and these will self - hybridize faster than the primers can bind , causing suppression of amplification . As an additional enrichment step the finished PCR reaction is diluted and a nested PCR is performed . Finally , the sites at the end of the cDNAs are used as sites of restriction digest , and for subsequent ligation into vectors for clone amplification . Both an up - and a down - library were created for each tested patient , and 10 000 clones were picked , amplified by PCR and spotted onto membranes . The original patient libraries were then radioactively labeled and hybridized . Clones of up - or down - regulated in at least 3 out of 8 patients were sent for sequencing . 3 . 2 PROTEIN EXPRESSION IN E . COLI AND INSECT CELLS E . coli E . coli expression of human proteins is an elegant system since it will give high yields at a relatively low cost . The eukaryotic gene is inserted into a plasmid that contains the genetic elements appropriate for bacterial gene expression , such as promoter and ribosomal binding site . As the plasmid is delivered into the bacteria , protein production can be performed on a large scale . However , the expression of eukaryotic proteins in a prokaryotic host presents some difficulties . If the protein does not fold properly , it will be degraded or it will be insoluble within the bacterium as aggregates in inclusion bodies . If this protein is to be used , it has to be refolded after purification . Large multidomain proteins are usually difficult to fold correctly , since bacterial proteins are normally small . Another drawback is that E . coli cannot do the proper post - translational modifications to eukaryotic proteins . In particular glycosylation is extremely uncommon in bacteria , and recombinant proteins will never be glycosylated in E . coli . This contributes to the 27 problematic folding , and can also impair the functionality of the recombinant protein ( Baneyx and Mujacic , 2004 ) . Insect cells Insect cells can also be used for protein production , but it is more labor - intense and is not as easily scaled up . But since it is a eukaryotic host it will make proteins at a higher fidelity to the original organism than E . coli . For example glycosylation is performed at a style close to the mammalian . In order to achieve high yields of protein , the gene is delivered via a baculoviral system . These viruses are specific to insect cells and will induce high production of the protein . The insertion of the gene into the viral genome can be achieved in some different ways . One method is known as Bac - to - Bac ( Invitrogen ) . Here the baculovirus DNA is propagated in E . coli as a single copy plasmid known as bacmid . These E . coli also contain a plasmid encoding a transposase . The gene of interest is cloned into a shuttle plasmid which , as the bacmid , contains sites for transposition . Recombination between the bacmid and the shuttle plasmid will insert the transgene into the bacmid . After purification , insect cells can be transfected with the bacmid to start the first production of recombinant viral particles that make the cells express the transgene ( Condreay and Kost , 2007 ) . 3 . 3 MATERIALS AND METHODS FOR PRELIMINARY DATA A few results from preliminary / unpublished experiments are discussed in the Results and Discussion section . Here are closer descriptions of these : Rotamase assay The rotamase assay uses a purified FKBP ( or another PPIase ) and a substrate peptide with a proline and a chromophore linked , that can be cleaved by chymotrypsin only when in the trans conformation . The cleaved off chromophore can be quantified by spectrophotometric reading . Thus the presence of a functional FKBP will speed up the reaction . Figure 6 The rotamase assay 28 Of the prolines in the peptide substrates , 20 % are normally in cis and 80 % in trans conformation . The prolines naturally flip between the two conformations . PPIases enhances the rate of this flipping . (cid:68) - chymotrypsin selectively cleaves the trans peptides . 80 % is then consumed at once , releasing the chromophore p - nitroaniline . This first phase of the reaction is too fast to be recorded . The remaining 20 % that were in the cis position then flip into trans at a fixed rate , being instantly consumed by (cid:68) - chymotrypsin until all substrate has been consumed , making up the second phase of the reaction . If a PPIase is present , the first phase is still the same , but the kinetics of the second reaction is faster , producing a steeper curve and a faster consumption of the substrate . (cid:68) - chymotrypsin was diluted in 0 . 1M Tris HCl pH 7 . 8 buffer ( 2 μl in 200μl Tris buffer / 1ml rx ) to a final concentration of 2 . 4μM and aliquoted into plastic cuvettes . Tris buffer , peptide ( final concentration 20μM ) and PPIase were mixed in eppendorph tubes and incubated for 1h at RT . To start the reaction , the cuvette containing (cid:68) - chymotrypsin was positioned in the spectrophotometer chamber , the other components were added and the reading performed at 390 nm . The peptides used were ALPF and AAPF . Positive control FKBP12 was used at final concentration 50nM for ALPF and 250nM for AAPF . WAFL peptides were used in final concentrations from 0 . 5μM to 4μM . Bacterial invasion Salmonella typhimurium serovar enterica strain TT16729LT2 , kindly provided by Prof Mikael Rhen , was used in these experiments . Bacterial culture was started by inoculating a colony grown on ampicillin - LB plate into fresh LB and left o / n at 225 rpm at 37 (cid:82) C . This culture was diluted 1 : 10 into fresh LB , tightly capped , and left for an additional 2h at 225 rpm and 37 (cid:82) C . Yersinia pseudotuberculosis YIII ( pIB102 ) , and plasmid - cured , were a generous gift by Prof Hans Wolf - Watz . A fresh colony was inoculated to an o / n culture in LB with kanamycin at 26 (cid:82) C 225 rpm , and then at 37 (cid:82) C for 2h . Shigella flexneri M90T ( Sansonetti lab ) was grown o / n in TCS broth with spectinomycin and placed on a roller at 37 (cid:82) C . A subculture was then added to fresh TCS broth with spectinomycin and rolled at 37 (cid:82) C for 2h . Bacteria giving MOI 1 : 100 to 1 : 10 were added to cell medium containing 20mM HEPES without FCS or antibiotics . HeLa or SW480 cells transfected with EGFP - WAFL and grown on cover slips were incubated for 5 min to 1h at 37 (cid:82) C with this medium , and when incubated longer it was replaced by complete cell medium with 20mM HEPES containing 50μg / ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria . Cells were fixed in warm 4 % formaldehyde , permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Trition X - 100 , and stained with appropriate antiserum to the bacteria according to standard protocol . Phosphatidylinositol phosphate binding A PIP Array ( Echelon Biosciences ) spotted with the seven kinds of PIPs , and PtdIns , was probed with 10 μg / ml WAFL coiled - coiled His - tagged protein according to the manufacturer ' s recommendations . Bound protein was detected by immunoblotting with anti - His antibody . Positive control peptide was LL5 - (cid:302) from the manufacturer , which should bind all the PIPs except PtdIns . 29 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The WAFL project spans from identification of a novel gene in diseased tissue to its functional characterization in vitro . It has been a challenging task , that has demanded employment of many different methods , and left some questions unanswered along the way . In order to fully grasp the magnitude of this project , a number of unpublished results will be presented . I will discuss the results we gathered divided into two parts . The first is the disease context in which it was identified , and some of our initial attempts of characterization . Then follows the story of the cell biological role of WAFL , and the implications it has on the normal cell machinery . Finally , I will present the theories we have to connect the role of WAFL in the cell , to a putative role in IBD . 4 . 1 IDENTIFICATION OF WAFL IN ULCERATIVE COLITIS AND INITIAL CHARACTERIZATIONL ( PAPER I : IDENTIFICATION OF A NEW WASP AND FKBP - LIKE ( WAFL ) PROTEIN IN INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE : A POTENTIAL MARKER GENE FOR ULCERATIVE COLITIS , AND PAPER II : EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION OF DOMAINS OF THE WASP AND FKBP - LIKE PROTEIN , A NOVEL MEMBER OF THE WASP FAMILY INVOLVED IN EARLY ENDOCYTOSIS , AND UNPUBLISHED RESULTS ) As UC is still a disease with unknown cause there is a great interest to discover the etiology of the disorder . Additionally , diagnosis is difficult since there is much similarity with CD . There has previously been some success in identifying dysregulated genes in Crohn’s disease , notably the breakthrough finding of NOD2 , but a similar step forward has not been achieved for ulcerative colitis , although some promising candidate genes have been proposed . Gene expression in ulcerative colitis ( Paper I ) We employed the SSH method in an attempt to characterize the gene expression profile of diseased tissue in ulcerative colitis . This study differs from previous work in two ways : First , paired inflamed and non - inflamed biopsies from the same patients were compared , in order to avoid the background noise that arises from the normal , individual , variation in baseline gene expression . Secondly , the SSH method is an open system where any mRNA that is present in the sample will be processed , in contrast to the predetermined set of genes in microarray experiments . The method is also sensitive to rare transcripts since they are enriched by SSH . We identified 331 differentially expressed genes , approximately half of them up - regulated . After grouping these into functional groups we found changes in four main categories : cell metabolism and ion transport , cell fate , structure and ECM , and inflammatory pathways . Previous studies have shown similar results , corresponding to the clinical manifestations of inflammation , epithelial barrier disruption , and increased risk of cancer development ( Costello et al . , 2005 ; Dieckgraefe et al . , 2000 ; Lawrance et 30 al . , 2001 ; Wu et al . , 2007 ) . The change in cell metabolism indicates disturbances in general epithelial homeostasis . Indeed , for UC , there is generally a repeatable pattern of functional groups that appear in gene expression studies , rather than on the level of individual genes . However , it should be noted that 18 % of the identified genes in our study have previously been reported in UC . One category is a novel finding by us , which consists of genes functional in membrane trafficking . This group involves genes such as members of the Rab family and sorting nexins . This result is indeed in line with the newly discovered function of autophagy in IBD , although this is so far mainly established in CD . Identification and initial characterization of WAFL ( Paper I ) Eleven percent of the genes were of unknown function . These genes represent interesting new players in a disease where little is still known on the molecular level . One up - regulated gene was especially interesting . Initial bioinformatic analysis revealed the gene to have sequence similarity with both the WASP - family of proteins and the FKBPs . This was a highly intriguing combination since the WASP knock - out mouse is a model for ulcerative colitis ( Nguyen et al . , 2007 ) , and WASP is the mutated protein in the Wiskott - Aldrich immunodeficiency syndrome . WASP proteins are also manipulated by invasive bacteria for entry and intracellular movement . FKBPs mediate the immunosuppressive effect of the drug Tacrolimus . Tacrolimus is used to prevent graft rejection in transplant patients , but can also be used to treat IBD patients , although this was not the case for any of the patients in our study . We selected this gene for further investigation , and called it WASP and FKBP - like ( WAFL ) with respect to these sequence similarities . Quantitative RT - PCR on a new set of IBD patients confirmed WAFL to be preferentially up - regulated in all investigated UC biopsies but not in the CD biopsies . This indicates that WAFL expression is not elevated in inflamed regions in general . Whether the lack of induction in CD or augmented levels in UC represents the normal or pathological response is not clear . The results display the strength of another aspect of our set - up : it was only in comparing inflamed and non - inflamed tissue in the same patients that the up - regulation could be seen . Individual levels varied , and if using pooled samples or normal controls for comparison , it would probably have gone undetected . Initial investigations into WAFL gene expression on mRNA and protein level revealed a ubiquitous profile , and still left us without clues to the function . Cytokine stimulation in cell culture assays did not affect WAFL expression ( unpublished data ) , however , differentiating monocytes to macrophages induced a 2 . 5 fold induction . Why would WAFL be expressed in macrophages compared to suspension monocytes ? The mature macrophage is very actively sampling the environment and is crawling through tissues . These processes demand active membrane reorganization and microfilament dynamics . These clues foretell the results found in Paper III , where WAFL is placed in the functional context of membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics . 31 Figure 7 Domain organization in the WAFL protein Structure of WAFL ( Paper II ) As WAFL was selected as our candidate gene for further characterization , we also aimed for a structural investigation . WAFL is predicted to have a unique combination of a WH1 domain and a FKBP domain in close proximity in its N - terminus . The structure of these domains have already been resolved but the combination of the two could generate a novel fold , and potentially also give functional clues . However , WAFL is a large protein of 1219 residues with several potential sites for post - translational modifications . This proved to be too challenging for E . coli expression of the full - length protein . Attempts to express the full - length protein in a baculovirus / insect cell system also failed due to degradation or aggregation during purification . Nonetheless , deletion constructs of WAFL were successfully expressed , as described in Paper II . Circular dichroism indicated that the expressed FKBP - domain and the central coiled - coil region had the predicted folds , and purification was very successful , yielding 95 % pure , folded protein . Figure 8 Four deletion constructs of WAFL have been successfully expressed and purified Yet , hitherto attempts to crystallize these purified peptides have been unproductive . They have however , been used for functional tests , one to test whether the FKBP domain has a predicted enzymatic activity ( below ) , and one to test the PIP binding of the coiled - coil domain ( see section 4 . 2 ) . Functional test of the FKBP - domain ( unpublished data ) The purified N - terminal peptides ( WAFLII , BFIV , FKBP ) were used for a functional assay to test the activity of the predicted FKBP domain . FKBPs are peptidyl - prolyl isomerases ( PPIases ) also known as rotamases or immunophilins . This means that they enable a proline residue to flip between cis and trans orientation with respect to the peptide bond . This reaction does occur naturally , but since there is a great energy barrier to overcome it is a rather slow process , typically many minutes , which can be greatly accelerated by PPIases ( Lu et al . , 2007 ) . The binding of the drugs Tacrolimus 32 and Rapamycin to the FKBP domain leads to the inhibition of the PPIase activity , although the actions of these drugs do not seem to be related directly to the inhibition . Figure 9 WAFL does not appear to have PPIase activity , since the kinetics of the reaction is similar to the negative control . All three constructs produced that contain the FKBP domain have been tested at various concentrations , and with two variants of the substrate peptide . So far no PPIase activity has been detected . This is in agreement with the results of Nakajima and colleagues in their study of the mouse homologue of WAFL ( noted as data not shown in their paper ) . However , our tests were carried out with truncated WAFL , and it could be that full - length protein or additional cofactors are required for activity . This is the case for FKBP39 that is only functional when bound to a calcium - calmodulin complex ( Edlich et al . , 2005 ) . A recent example is FKBP36 that will only exhibit PPIase activity after a residue modification ( Jarczowski et al . , 2008 ) . 33 4 . 2 FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF WAFL ( PAPER III : WAFL , A NEW PROTEIN INVOLVED IN REGULATION OF EARLY ENDOCYTIC TRANSPORT AT THE INTERSECTION OF ACTIN AND MICROTUBULE DYNAMICS , AND UNPUBLISHED DATA ) In order to elucidate the function of WAFL , the gene was cloned and fused to the GFP - protein . After transfection , a dotted cytoplasmic staining was seen , similar to the stainings for the endogenous protein . Localization to intracellular bacteria ( unpublished data ) Since no activity could be detected in WAFL’s FKBP domain , attention was diverted to the other domain of interest , the WH1 domain , previously only found in the WASP - family of proteins . The WASP - proteins are hi - jacked by pathogenic bacteria for colonization , invasion , and intracellular movement and spread . Since UC is a disease with suspected bacterial involvement , experiments were launched to test if WAFL could also play a part in bacterial interactions . Initial experiments involved colonic epithelial cell line ( SW480 ) that was challenged with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and then fixed and stained for microscopic analysis . We found WAFL to relocalize to the internalized bacteria . It was a sporadic observation among cells of a sample , but it was consistent and reproducible in several experiments . Subsequent experiments involved trials with two other invasive pathogens : Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri . These bacteria also resulted in WAFL recruitment , although it was an even rarer event for Shigella . The brief , and early , localization to Shigella could be because of its quick ( a few minutes ) escape from the phagosome . However we have so far not been able to find any functional effect of WAFL on bacterial invasion , to date what we have observed is the relocalization . WAFL localizes to early endosomes ( Paper III ) Why would WAFL localize to phagosomes ? Could it be that it was the phagosome , and not the bacteria in itself , which recruited WAFL ? We speculated whether the WAFL recruitment was part of a normal intracellular membrane localization , since it apparently was not a species - specific event . Phagocytosis is akin to endocytosis where the WASP - family of proteins is also involved . The WAFL dots could then represent endosomes . By using the EGFP - WAFL construct we could monitor the protein in live cell imaging , revealing that the dot - shaped structures were indeed motile within the cell , indicating a vesicular localization . Co - movement was also seen when cells were fed with fluorescently labeled dextran , as a marker for the endocytic pathway . Initial co - stainings for EEA1 , a marker for early endosomes , proved positive , although not complete . There seemed to be more of an association than a perfect overlap . However , this is not surprising , these organelles display a highly mosaic organization of surface proteins into dynamic domains , e . g . proteins such as Rab5 and Rab4 both stain to early endosomes , but in different parts ( Miaczynska and Zerial , 2006 ) . 34 Figure 10 SW480 cell 2h after Yersinia pseudotuberculosis uptake Figure 11 HeLa cell 2h after infection with Salmonella typhimurium Figure 12 HeLa cell 5 min after invasion with Shigella flexneri 35 Further studies with markers of other stages of the endocytic pathway revealed that WAFL indeed associated with early endosomes . In addition , this association was mathematically verified by an image quantification program in which 30 cells per marker were captured by confocal imaging and assessed in 3D . Figure 13 WAFL and EEA1 display partial co - localization ( picture not included in Paper III ) The coiled - coil domain is essential and sufficient for endosomal localization ( Paper III ) We cloned deletion constructs of EGFP - WAFL that enabled us to investigate the necessary domains that interact with endosomes . Just from the subcellular expression pattern of the deletion mutants it was clear that the central coiled - coil region was essential for vesicular targeting . Co - staining for EEA1 confirmed this observation . Indeed , the coiled - coil region in itself was sufficient for endosomal localization . WAFL depletion leads to disturbed endocytic trafficking ( Paper III ) In order to test the functional relevance of WAFL on endosomes , we set up an RNAi - dextran - feed experiment . Cells were fed with fluorescently labeled dextran . The processing of dextran through the degradative route could then be monitored by FACS , since fluorescence is quenched at lower pH . The results consistently showed a higher signal for WAFL - depleted cells after 30 min chase , an effect that was wearing off at 2 h . Our interpretation is that WAFL is not essential for delivery to lysosomes , but is needed for correct processing earlier on , and that the lack of WAFL will cause disturbances . WAFL and actin and microtubules ( Paper III and unpublished data ) The similarity with the WASP - proteins additionally called for investigations into a potential role for WAFL in actin regulation . Early endosomes are known to employ both microfilaments and microtubules for intracellular movement . Therefore parallel 36 studies into microtubule - associated aspects were pursued . HeLa cells were co - stained for endogenous WAFL and actin , or microtubules . Moreover , live cells expressing EGFP - WAFL were treated with actin or microtubule - disrupting drugs , and monitored before and after treatment , to investigate the mean of transport for WAFL - labeled endosomes . The experiments gave interesting results : WAFL did not show any colocalization with the large stress fibers of the cell , but rather with actin clusters in the central cell region , however , the movement of WAFL structures was not inhibited by the latrunculin A - inhibition , although relocalization was seen towards the middle of the cell . For microtubules a subtle but clear alignment in the orientation of the filaments was seen , and movement was in complete arrest after nocodazol - treatment . These results reflect that the movement of WAFL - labeled vesicles is mainly on microtubules , but that a contribution of actin can not be excluded . An additional result that further indicates WAFL in both of these cytoskeletal systems is the phenotype of RNAi WAFL - depleted cells ( unpublished data ) : Tubulin Actin ( phalloidin ) Figure 14 Phenotype of WAFL - RNAi treated HeLa cells The RNAi - treated cells display a highly elongated shape , in itself an indication of a flaw in cytoskeletal function . Staining for actin reveals cells with fewer stress fibers and an increase in central actin clusters , similar to those that WAFL previously was seen to localize with . The microtubule staining is less revealing , but there seems to be some disorganization among the microtubules . The actin interaction was studied more specifically , since WAFL has a WH1 domain that could potentially bind to WIP . Also binding to actin was assayed , although no apparent actin - binding domain has been identified in the WAFL sequence . By co - transfection and co - immunoprecipitation we did indeed see WAFL - WIP interaction . Deletion mutants of WIP further showed that binding was dependent on the WASP - 37 binding domain , indicating a similar way of interaction as with WASP and N - WASP . Also actin binding was positive , although one cannot conclude from the IP whether binding was to monomeric or filamentous actin , or if it is a direct interaction , or via another protein , perhaps WIP . If the WH1 domain of WAFL seems functional , what about the other similarity to the WASP - proteins : the acidic C - terminus . Below is an alignment of this region in WAFL together with the equivalent region in four other proteins in which it is known to bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex : Figure 15 WAFL C - terminus aligned to the acidic ( A ) portion of other Arp2 / 3 - binding proteins . Acidic residues are marked in bold and the conserved tryptophan in gray . WAFL has a stretch of aspartic acid residues and the third last residue is a tryptophan . These are the basic similarities that unite these regions in the various proteins . Especially the tryptophan is essential for Arp2 / 3complex binding and functionality ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) . However , we have investigated the potential function of this region in WAFL , with negative results . Arp2 / 3 binding by immunoprecipitation has been tested with negative results , and also direct pyrene - actin in vitro polymerization assays with purified c - terminal WAFL was unfruitful . Notably , in the highly similar mouse homologue , alternative splicing has been reported for this very region ( Nakajima et al . , 2006 ) . WAFL binds to PIPs ( unpublished data ) WAFL was found to interact with endosomes via its coiled - coil region . Membrane anchorage can be achieved via different mechanisms , one is binding to PIPs , which are also very specific markers of membrane organelles . The His - tagged coiled - coil protein described in Paper II was used to investigate this . It was probed onto a membrane spotted with the seven kinds of PIPs and PtdIns . Clear signal was detected in the three monophosphorylated lipids , although weak signal was detected for all lipids except PtdIns and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 . The strongest signal appeared with PtdIns ( 3 ) P , which is found in the membrane of early endosomes . The WAFL coiled - coil protein also binds clearly to PtdIns ( 4 ) P and PtdIns ( 5 ) P . PtdIns ( 4 ) P is located to the Golgi whereas the localization of PtdIns ( 5 ) P remains poorly characterized ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ) . This is an additional possible arena for WAFL in vesicle transport . Indeed WAFL staining quite often displays a clustering of vesicles around the juxtanuclear space . Interestingly , the PIP interaction also gives clues to the phagosomal localization that WAFL exhibits . Invasive pathogens frequently manipulate the PIP profile of its 38 intracellular compartment . This is especially apparent in the case of Salmonella , which induces sustained production of PtdIns ( 3 ) P by action of its effector SopB ( Hernandez et al . , 2004 ) . Figure 16 PIP binding of the WAFL coiled - coil domain ( left ) and control peptide ( right ) . Potential WAFL function Altogether these results present WAFL as a membrane - binding protein that interacts with early endosomes and phagosomes and affects the proper processing of endocytic cargo . Further , WAFL appears to operate at the intersection of actin and microtubule dynamics . Direct interaction with WIP and actin points to an active role in microfilament regulation , whereas the microtubule connection remains more obscure . Since WIP is known to bind to both N - WASP and WASP to a very high degree , it is tempting to speculate that WAFL interaction is a regulatory mechanism to sequester WIP . Alternatively , binding could be a means to recruit WIP to endosomes . If WAFL - depletion disturbs the transition of endosomes from actin to microtubule - based transport , this could offer an explanation for the altered delivery to lysosomes seen in Paper III . Perhaps the increase in actin clusters seen in WAFL - depleted cells would be in accordance with this speculation . 39 WASP and N - WASP WAVE1 , 2 , 3 WAFL Actin - binding Yes Yes Yes Binding to PIPs PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( N - WASP ) PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( WAVE2 ) PtdIns ( 3 ) P , PtdIns ( 4 ) P , PtdIns ( 5 ) P Organism expression Homologues from yeast to mammals In multicellular organisms ( e . g .

Interestingly , 6 % of the differentially expressed genes found in our SSH - screen were involved in membrane trafficking . This points to a general involvement of this category of proteins in ulcerative colitis , where WAFL is one component . There are a number of potential sites of action for these proteins in the disease , and probably they work at several of them . Let’s speculate from the starting point of some of the main clinical features of UC : inflammation , barrier dysfunction , and bacterial interaction . Inflammation is a process that requires vast membrane remodeling . From the motile macrophages and neutrophils that engulf extracellular particles and microbes , to the processing of antigens for presentation at the cell surface on MHC molecules . Defects in apoptotic cell clearance can potentially result in autoimmune disease . Additionally , regulation of response to receptor signaling takes place by membrane remodeling and receptor internalization . The disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier is a key feature of IBD . Its integrity depends on the apical junctional complexes ( AJC ) . The disruption of these structures is believed to be initiated by cytokines , and this process has been modeled in vitro . The tight junction and apical junction proteins of the AJC are removed from the cell surface by clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and are delivered to a cytosolic compartment that stains for early endosomal markers Rab5 and EEA1 ( Ivanov et al . , 2004 ) . Dysregulation at the level of the endocytic machinery could potentially cause increased epithelial permeability . It has been shown that IBD patients have a higher bacterial colonization at the epithelial cell lining and mucous layer . In general it is believed that the inflammation in IBD is response to the normal gut flora due to a dysfunctional epithelial barrier . Also pathogens have been implicated , although it remains unanswered whether they would initiate the inflammation or take advantage of the damaged host . What is clear however is that the host has a very delicate task in balancing tolerance to commensals with an efficient inflammatory response to pathogens . In IBD , this balance is lost . Handling bacteria can be executed by receptors like TLR4 and Nod2 that senses the environment and then signals when bacteria are present . Interestingly , Nod2 is an intracellular sensor , and in intestinal epithelial cells , TLR4 has been shown to require the internalization of LPS for signaling . This is in contrast to macrophages which have cell - surface recognition ( Hornef et al . , 2003 ) . Possibly this is a reflection of tolerance to the commensals in the intestine . Another feature is the handling of bacteria once they have reached inside the cell , which is executed in phagosomes and autophagosomes . Needless to say both of these strategies are dependent on endomembranes . Genes related to the function of the autophagosome have recently been identified in IBD . 41 5 CONCLUDING REFLECTIONS This thesis is a description of a scientific journey that started with an unknown gene sequence from a SSH library , and ends in its functional characterization as WAFL , a protein involved in endosomal trafficking . Every time a new feature of WAFL has been revealed , another ten new questions appeared . Finding a new piece of the puzzle forced us to constantly reconsider and revise our initial hypothesis . The scientific literature has offered material for much speculation around the role of WAFL , and one of the most challenging tasks has been to select what experiments to prioritize . After many endeavors we have now a glimpse of the function of WAFL . The full potential of the biological and functional relevance of WAFL is still waiting to be revealed , but a lot is to be expected of a ubiquitously expressed , multidomain protein with implications in membrane dynamics . The potential scope of its function is vast . Endocytosis is crucial to maintain the body and its cells at health . When specific receptor endocytosis is affected particular diseases arise . Examples are familial hypercholesterolemia when the LDL receptor is dysfunctional which leads to early onset of atherosclerosis and an increased risk of cardiac disease . General problems in endocytic trafficking cause other , multiple tissue - diseases . These are often neurological disorders , pigmentation defects , or developmental problems . But also immune dysregulation is reported , as in Griscelli syndrome , where immune impairment arises due to defective secretion of lytic granules by cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( Stinchcombe et al . , 2001 ) . WAFL was isolated in the context of the intestinal barrier of IBD . First line defense cells , such as epithelial cells , are constantly under stress imposed by luminal content in the intestinal canal , including high load of gut microbiota . Intestinal epithelial cells already have high membrane turnover due to their absorptive and transcytic function . An inadequate handling of internalized cargo could potentially lead to additional stress signals and activation of inflammatory signaling pathways that disrupt normal barrier function . If this occurs in intestinal epithelial cells , this may render the gut prone to leakage with subsequent invasion of gut microbiota into the lamina propria . As a consequence an unwanted innate immune response will be mounted coupled to prolonged inflammation . Our SSH expression profile revealed that UC is characterized by differential expression of many metabolic proteins , indicating an imbalanced epithelial homeostasis . A cell in this condition is more likely to accumulate stress signals that can trigger an inflammatory state . In allegory it has recently been shown in a study by Kaser et al ( Kaser et al . , 2008 ) that deletion of a gene involved in handling ER stress is sufficient to elicit intestinal inflammation in mice . Membrane trafficking is a central component in the cell machinery . It is therefore tempting to speculate that the chronic inflammation displayed in inflamed tissue from UC biopsies may in part arise from a non - optimal intracellular transportation system . Why WAFL and other endocytic proteins are differentially expressed in ulcerative colitis remains to be investigated . But considering the multitude of potential sites of action , it is likely that more connections are to be expected . 42 Finally , WAFL function in the body at large is exciting to envision . A functional role for WAFL in brain biology has been proposed . The mouse homologue of WAFL was identified in brain development and was found to affect the growth of axons . In addition , WAFL may also be involved in regulation at the synapse , where correct and timely vesicle shuttling is crucial for neurotransmission . Our observation of checker - board expression of WAFL in heart muscle cells is intriguing and investigations into muscle function are highly warranted . The proposed function of WAFL involvement in intracellular transportation indicates that immune cells regulating phagocytosis may also be of interest to study . Indeed , our data show that WAFL expression can be induced in macrophages . In conclusion , I believe WAFL to be a candidate for many key cellular processes . It is with pride that I introduce this novel star into the scientific lime light . Take a bow . 43 6 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS My work during this thesis has been carried out in four different labs .
