ABSTRACT The effect of network changes on the surface and interface properties of amine - cured epoxy has been investigated . Samples of different crosslinked epoxies are prepared by mixing stoichiometrically pure diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A ( n = 0 . 03 ) with different ratios of 1 , 3 - bis ( aminomethyl ) cyclohexane ( terafunctional amine ) and cyclohexylmethylamine ( difunctional amine ) . All samples are cured in CO 2 - free air . Both the film surface in contact with air and that in contact with the silicon substrate ( the interface ) are analyzed using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and nanoindentation . Small angle neutron scattering ( SANS ) , attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared ( ATR - FTIR ) spectroscopy , and contact angle measurements , are used to assist in the interpretation of AFM results . Substantial morphological and mechanical differences are observed between the surface and the interface for different crosslinked epoxies . The findings have strong implications on the wettablity , adhesion , and durability of amine - cured epoxies . INTRODUCTION Crosslinking is an important process in the film formation of coatings and the network structure of the coating is usually related to its application [ 1 ] . Changes in network structure invariably cause changes in the chemical , physical , and mechanical properties of a coating . Such changes can occur at surfaces and interfaces . Because surface and interface properties control the wettability , adhesion , and durability of coatings , the study of network effects on these properties is important for improving coating performance . However , little work has been reported on this subject . In this research , the effects of crosslink density on the chemical , mechanical and morphological properties of both surfaces and interfaces of epoxy coatings are investigated . The properties are characterized using AFM , nanoindentation , SANS , ATR - FTIR spectroscopy and contact angle measurements . EXPERIEMNTAL * Materials and specimen preparation Highly pure diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A with weight per epoxy equivalent of 172 g / eq . was used . The curing agents used were mixtures of 1 , 3 - bis ( aminomethyl ) - cyclohexane ( BAC ) and cyclohexylmethylamine ( CMA ) . Samples of four different crosslinked epoxies were DD10 . 9 . 1 Mat . Res . Soc . Symp . Proc . Vol . 710 © 2002 Materials Research Society prepared with stoichiometric blends of DGEBA with appropriate amine mixtures . The corresponding mole ratios of BAC to CMA for epoxy samples of E1000 , E7525 , E5050 , and E2575 are listed in Table 1 . For dynamic mechanical analysis , freestanding films of approximately 150 µ m in thickness were made by molding the resins between two Mylar  - covered glass plates . For AFM and other measurements , the surface and interface samples were obtained from coated films applied on silicon substrates . These films were about 300 µ m in thickness and were prepared in a CO 2 - and H 2 O - free glove box by a draw - down technique . All samples were cured at room temperature for 48 h , followed by post - curing at 130 ° C for 2 h . The coated films were removed from the silicon substrates by cooling in liquid nitrogen , followed by peeling with tweezers . The face in contact with the silicon substrate is termed the interface , while the one exposed to air is the surface . Dynamic mechanical analysis ( DMA ) DMA was performed with a Rheometrics Solids Analyzer RSA II in the tensile mode at a frequency of 10 Hz . Temperature increment was 5 ° C from 25 ° C to 70 ° C and 2 ° C from 70 ° C to 170 ° C . Films having dimensions of 10 mm by 30 mm and thickness of about 0 . 15 mm were used . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) A Dimension 3100 Scanning Probe Microscope from Digital Instruments was operated in tapping mode to characterize the surface and interface morphology of epoxies with different crosslink densities . Commercial silicon microcantilever probes were used . Topographic and phase images were obtained simultaneously using a resonance frequency of approximately 300 kHz for the probe oscillation and a free - oscillation amplitude of 62 nm ± 2 nm . The set - point ratio ranged from 0 . 60 to 0 . 80 . AFM was also used for nanoindentation tests using a diamond tip mounted on a stainless steel cantilever with the spring constant of ( 120 ± 10 ) N / m . The cantilever sensitivity was determined through measurements with a sapphire sample before and after the indentation tests . Three load levels were used to indent all the samples . For each load level , five force curves were obtained for epoxy surface and interface samples and ten for sapphire . SANS measurements SANS experiments over the q range from 0 . 009 Å - 1 to 0 . 138 Å - 1 were carried out using the 8 - m SANS instrument at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) Center for Neutron Research ( NCNR ) . The incident neutron wavelength was λ = 8 Å with a wavelength resolution of ∆λ / λ = 0 . 15 . The scattered intensity was corrected for background and parasitic scattering , placed on an absolute level using a calibrated secondary standard and circularly averaged to yield the scattered intensity , I ( q ) , as a function of the wave vector , q , where q = ( 4 π / λ ) sin ( θ / 2 ) ( θ is the scattering angle ) . DD10 . 9 . 2 ATR - FTIR and contact angle measurement Unless otherwise stated , the same experiment procedures were carried out as those described in Reference 2 . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Crosslink density The networks were characterized in terms of the average molecular mass between crosslinks , Mc . The Mc values calculated from the dynamical mechanical storage moduli assuming the validity of the rubber elasticity theory [ 3 ] as Mc = 3 ρ RT / E r ’ ( 1 ) where E r ’ is the storage modulus value in rubbery region , T is temperature corresponding to E’ , ρ is the network density at the test temperature , and R is the gas constant . Equation 1 assumes the network is ideal and all chains are elastically effective . A higher value of Mc corresponds to a less crosslinked network . As can be seen in Table 1 , when the BAC / CMA ratio is changed from 100 / 0 to 25 / 75 , a decreasing trend is observed for the crosslink density and glass transition temperature ( Tg ) . Table 1 .

In Figure 1 , topographic and phase images of both surface ( 1a , 2a ) and interface ( 1b , 2b ) for two different crosslinked epoxies are shown . For both E1000 and E2575 , the height and phase images of the interface exhibit greater contrast as compared to those of the surface , indicating that there are morphological differences between the surface and the interface . First , the interface is considerably rougher than the surface . Second , well - defined heterogeneous structures are observed for the interface but not for the surfaces . It should be mentioned that the silicon surface is essentially smooth and featureless as observed by AFM imaging . A two - phase microstructure , consisting of a bright matrix and relatively dark interstitial regions are observed in the interface phase images . This kind of heterogeneous structure is similar to those reported for other thermoset resins [ 2 , 4 ] . Recently , such morphological differences between the surface and interface have also been observed for acrylic melamine and other epoxies in our laboratory [ 5 ] . DD10 . 9 . 3 Figure 1 .

As can be seen in Figure 1 , the sizes of the bright nodules in the phase image of the interface are larger for the low crosslinked E2575 compared to the high crosslinked E1000 . This observation implies that the crosslink density may have an influence on the microstructure of the interface , though no obvious effects were observed on the surface . The differences between the surface and the interface of the epoxy coatings are probably due to surface enrichment and interface interaction and confinement . The polarity results obtained from contact angle measurements ( Table 2 ) have provided evidence for such a hypothesis . For each epoxy , the polarity of the interface is higher than that of the surface , indicating that the air DD10 . 9 . 4 surface of coatings could be covered with a thin layer of lower surface - free energy material . Additionally , the surface polarity appears independent of network variation while the interface polarity increases with decreasing crosslinking . Microstructure study using SANS Figures 2a and 2b represent the SANS data for epoxy bulk samples of E1000 and E5050 after soaking in deuterated acetone . For Dry bulk samples , only incoherent scattering background is observed due to no neutron contrast in both E1000 and E5050 . After soaking in d - acetone , the solvent diffused into and swelled the voids and / or the low crosslinked regions and enhanced the neutron contrast of the heterogeneous regions in the network . An upturn is seen in the relatively low q region ( ca . q < 0 . 03 Å ) from E1000 in Figure 2a suggests the existence of a well - ordered microdomain . The value of the peak position can be related to an average predominant domain size , d , as d = 2 π / q , The domain size estimated from the predicted peak position ( see insert in Figure 2a ) is approximately 50nm , which is well consistent with the nodules size obtained from the AFM . The time dependence of the scattering profiles indicates the peak tends to shift to a lower q position with a longer soaking time . Because the lower q will Figure 2 . Small angle neutron scattering profile of ( a ) E1000 bulk sample as a function of soaking time in deuterated acetone and ( b ) E1000 and E5050 bulk samples soaked in deuterated acetone for about 32 h . ( a ) ( b ) DD10 . 9 . 5 result in a larger domain size , this observation is consistent with the swelling of the network with the time . However , no peak was observed in the scattering profile for E5050 after soaking 32 h in Figure 2b , it implies a larger sized domain distributed in the network , which corresponds to a very low q value . The above SANS data from the bulk samples are consistent with the heterogeneous microstructures observed from the interface samples using the AFM . Further studies on this topic are being conducted with nanoindentation and ATR - FTIR . The results will be presented . SUMMARY Effects of network changes on the surface and interface properties of amine - cured epoxy have been investigated by AFM , nanoindentation , ATR - FTIR and contact angle measurements . Results have shown a strong influence of crosslink density on the surface and interface properties of epoxies . Substantial morphological and chemical differences are also observed between the coating surface and interface . The SANS data are confirmed the existence of a heterogeneous microstructure for epoxy network . REFERENCES 1 . K . Dusek and M . Duskov - Smrckova , Prog . Polym .
