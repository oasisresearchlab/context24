Article Local Turgor Pressure Reduction via Channel Clustering Jonah K . Scher - Zagier 1 and Anders E . Carlsson 1 , * 1 Department of Physics , Washington University , Saint Louis , Missouri ABSTRACT The primary drivers of yeast endocytosis are actin polymerization and curvature - generating proteins , such as cla - thrin and BAR domain proteins . Previous work has indicated that these factors may not be capable of generating the forces necessary to overcome turgor pressure . Thus local reduction of the turgor pressure , via localized accumulation or activation of solute channels , might facilitate endocytosis . The possible reduction in turgor pressure was calculated numerically , by solving the diffusion equation through a Legendre polynomial expansion . It was found that for a region of increased permeability having radius 45 nm , as few as 60 channels with a spacing of 10 nm could locally decrease the turgor pressure by 50 % . We identiﬁed a key dimensionless parameter , p ¼ P 1 a / D , where P 1 is the increased permeability , a is the radius of the permeable region , and D is the solute diffusion coefﬁcient . When p > 0 . 44 , the turgor pressure is locally reduced by > 50 % . An approximate analytic theory was used to generate explicit formulas for the turgor pressure reduction in terms of key parameters . These ﬁndings may also be relevant to plants , where the mechanisms that allow endocytosis to proceed despite high turgor pressure are largely unknown . INTRODUCTION Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) contributes to numerous biological processes , such as cell growth , viral in - vasion , and neural signaling ( 1 ) . It involves the inward bending of a portion of the lipid bilayer , which subsequently pinches off to form a vesicle that moves into the cytoplasm . CME has been studied extensively in yeast , due to the ease of genetic manipulation and ﬂuorescent labeling . In yeast , CME involves actin polymerization as well as clathrin and BAR - domain proteins , which help drive invagination through a nonzero preferred curvature . It is believed ( 2 – 5 ) that growing actin ﬁlaments exert pushing forces on the membrane , which drive the actin network into the cyto - plasm . This motion of the actin network exerts pulling forces to drive invagination , through a coupling via the adaptor protein Sla2 . Recent theoretical work on CME in yeast has treated the mechanics of forces generated by actin polymerization , as well as the intrinsic curvature of the cla - thrin coat that accumulates on the cell membrane ( 5 – 8 ) . To date , however , it is not known how actin and other curva - ture - generating proteins can produce enough force to over - come the large turgor pressure in yeast ( 9 , 10 ) . Here we explore the hypothesis that increasing the membrane perme - ability at the endocytic site can locally reduce the turgor pressure and thus facilitate endocytosis . The turgor pressure P ( 10 ) pushes the plasma membrane against the cell wall and thus helps the cell maintain its shape and rigidity . It is generated through the larger internal concentration of glycerol , the main osmolyte in yeast , rela - tive to the outside . The magnitude of P is determined by the requirement that the chemical potential of the solvent ( water ) be constant across the membrane . For a dilute solution , the solvent chemical potential is m ð P ; T ; C Þ ¼ m 0 ð P ; T Þ (cid:2) ð C = C solvent Þ k B T ( 11 ) , where P is pressure ; T is temperature ; and C and C solvent are the solute and solvent concentrations , respectively . The chemical potential varies with pressure according to vm 0 ð P ; T Þ = v P ¼ 1 = N A C solvent ( 11 ) , where N A is Avogadro’s number and C solvent is given in molar units . Thus the constancy of m implies ( here we have ignored possible changes in the concentrations result - ing from pressure variations , because pressure changes in cells are much smaller than the gigapascal bulk modulus of water ) that between any two points , D P ¼ N A k B T D C : ( 1 ) If the points are on opposite sides of the membrane , this implies that the turgor pressure is P ¼ N A k B T D C ; ( 2 ) Submitted June 24 , 2016 , and accepted for publication October 13 , 2016 . * Correspondence : aec @ wustl . edu Editor : James Keener .

In the scenario treated here , where a permeable patch leads to large concentration gradients in - side the cell , Eq . 1 implies corresponding internal gradients of the pressure . Thus pressure does not equilibrate , even at long times , as long as the concentration gradient is main - tained by the continuing production of osmolyte inside the cell . The pressure gradient does not cause macroscopic ﬂuid ﬂow , because there are additional forces on water molecules due to the osmolyte concentration gradient . The situation is analogous to that of water in a swimming pool . The pressure is greater at the bottom , but there is no macroscopic ﬂow because the water molecules at the bottom have lower grav - itational potential energy . In this case , the gravitational po - tential energy variation is replaced by variation in the free energy of water molecules resulting from the inhomoge - neous osmolyte concentration . Can established mechanisms , including curvature - gener - ating proteins and actin polymerization , provide enough force to overcome the turgor pressure barrier ? The driving forces from curvature - generating proteins and actin , along with opposing forces from surface tension and turgor pres - sure , are encapsulated in the Helfrich membrane deforma - tion energy : U ¼ Z S (cid:2) 2 k ð H (cid:2) H 0 Þ 2 þ s (cid:2) f actin z (cid:3) dS þ P V : ( 3 ) Here k is the bending modulus , P is the turgor pressure , dS is an element of membrane area , V is volume of the invagi - nation , H is the mean curvature , H 0 is the spontaneous cur - vature , s is the surface tension , z is the inward displacement of the membrane , and f actin is the pulling force density from actin . We estimate whether it is energetically favorable for a hemispherical invagination of radius of R i ¼ 30 nm ( 12 ) to form in the presence of accepted values of the turgor pressure . We take k ¼ 285 k B T ( 13 ) , and P ¼ 0 . 6 MPa as an average over a number of measurements ( 14 – 19 ) . Then the stabilizing contribution from the curvature - generating proteins is ¼ (cid:2) 2 p R 2 i k = R 2 i ¼ (cid:2) 1800 k B T ( the negative of the curvature energy of the ﬂattened membrane ) , while the opposing contribution from the turgor pressure is ð 2 p = 3 Þ R 3 i P ¼ 8250 k B T , leaving 8250 k B T (cid:2) 1800 k B T ¼ 6450 k B T to be supplied by actin pulling forces . It is unlikely that actin polymerization can supply such a large energy . The above calculation suggests that ~ 22 % of the opposing force from turgor pressure is canceled by the curvature - generating proteins , leaving a residual pressure of ~ 0 . 47 MPa to be generated by actin polymerization . This corresponds to a total force of 0 : 47 MPa (cid:3) p ð 30 nm Þ 2 ¼ 1300 pN . This force must come from the polymerization of actin ﬁlaments around the invag - ination ( 4 , 5 ) . The number of growing actin ﬁlaments is estimated to be 100 – 150 ( 20 ) , so forces of ~ 10 pN per ﬁlament would be required . But the stall force estimated for a 2 m M free actin concentration A ( 20 ) is only f stall ¼ k B T = d ln ð A = A c Þ x 5 pN ( 21 ) , using a critical concentration of 0 . 1 m M ( 22 ) and a polymerization step size d ¼ 2 : 7 nm . Thus actin polymerization cannot generate the 10 pN per ﬁlament force required . The 10 pN estimate is sensitive to the number of growing ﬁlaments ; a ﬁlament number that is two to three times larger than the estimated value would reduce the force per ﬁlament below the stall force . However , it is unlikely that the growing - ﬁlament number exceeds our estimate . Sirotkin et al . ( 23 ) estimated the upper bound of the number of growing ﬁlaments to be 140 , by subtracting the number of capping protein mole - cules present from the number of Arp2 / 3 molecules , where the latter number was assumed to correspond to the number of actin ﬁlaments . Berro et al . ( 24 ) estimated only eight growing ﬁlaments on the basis of polymerization - dynamics experiments . Previous work has also suggested that known mecha - nisms of actin polymerization are too weak to drive endocy - tosis . A ﬁnite - element calculation ( 4 ) found that the actin polymerization pressure was too small to overcome the turgor pressure , and that overcoming a turgor pressure of just 0 . 1 MPa requires an actin network stiffer than any that have been studied to date . Another calculation based on membrane elasticity theory and an actin point force sug - gested that the required force is even larger than our esti - mate ( 5 ) . Finally , calculations using somewhat different approaches ( 10 ) found it implausible that actin polymeriza - tion can overcome the turgor pressure . We note , however , that the insufﬁciency of actin polymerization forces cannot be taken as rigorously proved , because there are substantial uncertainties in all of the quantities used to estimate the slowing of polymerization . Thus for endocytosis to proceed against current esti - mates of the turgor pressure , rather extreme assumptions about actin polymerization forces and elastic properties would likely have to hold . A local reduction of the turgor pressure , in the vicinity of the endocytic site , provides a possible alternative to unphysically large actin polymeriza - tion forces . MATERIALS AND METHODS To see how much the turgor pressure might be reduced by a physically reasonable distribution of membrane channels , we solve two diffusion - based models of yeast membranes with locally enhanced permeability . The assumption of a locally enhanced permeability is supported by the observation of patches of the glycerol transporter Fps1 at the cell membrane in budding yeast ( 25 ) . However , it is not known whether these patches coin - cide with endocytic sites . Assumptions Model 1 assumes a spherical cell with the membrane permeability increased in a narrow circular patch ( see Fig . 1 ) . Glycerol , the main osmo - lyte , is produced at a rate , constant in both time and space within the cell . Scher - Zagier and Carlsson 2748 Biophysical Journal 111 , 2747 – 2756 , December 20 , 2016 The turgor pressure is determined by a balance between production and leakage . We assume azimuthal symmetry about the center of the permeable patch , and deﬁne the angle q relative to this center . To optimize numerical convergence , we assume a smoothly varying permeability proﬁle of the form P ð q Þ ¼ P a þ P b exp ½(cid:2) q 2 = ð D q Þ 2 (cid:4) . For ease of comparison with our analytic Model 2 below , we also ﬁt this to a model with a discontinuous permeability , having the form : P ð q Þ ¼ (cid:4) P 1 q < q 0 P 2 q > q 0 : ( 4 ) The coefﬁcients P a ; b of the continuous permeability are chosen so that P ð 0 Þ ¼ P 1 ; P ð p Þ ¼ P 2 . We then choose D q to optimize the ﬁt to the discontinuous permeability . For conceptual clarity , we present our results below in terms of q 0 , P 1 , and P 2 . Model 2 assumes an inﬁnite , impermeable plane , with two long - distance concentrations C in ; C out , and a perfectly permeable hole of radius a ( we take C out ¼ 0 in our results presented below ) . These approximations allow forananalyticsolution . Model2isagoodapproximationtoModel1incertain parameter ranges , because the size of the permeable patch is small relative to the size of the cell , and the permeability in the middle of the patch is much larger than that far from the patch . In relating Models 1 and 2 , we ﬁnd that a good match is obtained by taking a ¼ 1 : 3 q 0 R , where R is the cell radius . In both models , the varying concentrations of glycerol cause a spatially varying hydrostatic pressure because of the constraint of spatially constant chemical potential . The effects of the pressure on the water and glycerol diffusion coefﬁcients , and possible pressure gradient terms in the glycerol current , are assumed small and are neglected . Equations In Model 1 , the steady - state distribution of glycerol C ð r Þ is governed by the reaction - diffusion equations : D V 2 C ð r Þ þ a ¼ 0 ð r < R Þ ; ( 5 ) D V 2 C ð r Þ ¼ 0 ð r > R Þ ; ( 6 ) where r is distance from the center of the cell , D is the diffusion coefﬁcient , and a is the rate of glycerol production . The boundary conditions , taking into account the deﬁnition of the permeability as the ratio of current density to concentration discontinuity , are 8 > < > : (cid:5) v C v r (cid:6) r ¼ R ¼ (cid:2) P ð q Þð 1 = D Þ D C ; lim r / N C ð r ; q Þ ¼ 0 ( 7 ) where D C ¼ lim e / 0 P C ð R (cid:2) e ; q Þ (cid:2) C ð R þ e ; q Þ R is the concentration discontinuity . Because Model 2 assumes asymptotic concentrations rather than a pro - duction rate , there is no a term , and we have D V 2 C ð r Þ ¼ 0 : ( 8 ) The boundary conditions are 8 > > > > > > > < > > > > > > > : C ð z ¼ 0 þ ; r Þ ¼ C ð z ¼ 0 (cid:2) ; r Þ for r < a (cid:5) v C v z (cid:6) z ¼ 0 ¼ 0 for r > a lim z / N C ð z ; r Þ ¼ C out lim z / (cid:2) N C ð z ; r Þ ¼ C in : ( 9 ) Here z is the coordinate perpendicular to the plane ( at z ¼ 0 ) , and r is the radial coordinate , measured from the z axis going through the center of the hole . Solution of Model 1 Model 1 has the general solution C ð r ; q Þ ¼ (cid:2) a 6 Dr 2 þ X N l ¼ 0 C l ð r = R Þ l P l ð cos q Þ r < R ; ( 10 ) C ð r ; q Þ ¼ a R 3 3 Dr (cid:2) X N l ¼ 1 lC l l þ 1 ð R = r Þ l þ 1 P l ð cos q Þ r > R : ( 11 ) Here we have expanded P ð q Þ as P ð q Þ ¼ P N l ¼ 0 A l P l ð cos q Þ , where P l ð cos q Þ is the Legendre polynomial of order l and A l ¼ ½ð 2 l þ 1 Þ = 2 (cid:4) R d q cos ð q Þ P ð q Þ P l ð cos q Þ ; the relationship between the coefﬁ - cients of P l for r > R and r < R results from the continuity of v C = v r at R . Integrating the ﬁrst of expressions in Eq . 7 with P k ð cos q Þ and employing the orthogonality properties of the Legendre polynomials , we see that the C l in Eqs . 10 and 11 satisfy ð 1 = D Þ X N l ¼ 0 X N m ¼ 0 2 l þ 1 l þ 1 C l I lmk A m þ kC k R 2 2 k þ 1 ¼ a R 2 2 D 2 A k 2 k þ 1 þ 2 a R 3 D d k 0 ; ( 12 ) FIGURE 1 Model 1 , spherical cell with perme - able patch ; Model 2 , plane with hole .

Local Turgor Pressure Reduction Biophysical Journal 111 , 2747 – 2756 , December 20 , 2016 2749 where ( in terms of the Wigner - 3j symbol ) ( 26 ) : I lmk ¼ Z 1 (cid:2) 1 d ð cos q Þ P l ð cos q Þ P m ð cos q Þ P k ð cos q Þ ¼ 2 (cid:5) l m k 0 0 0 (cid:6) 2 : ( 13 ) The 3j - symbols are nonzero only when J ¼ l þ m þ k is even , and were calculated from the identity where g ¼ J = 2 . To calculate the coefﬁcients numerically , we approximate the inﬁnite - dimensional system with one of ﬁnite dimension by truncating the summa - tion at L coefﬁcients , resulting in an L (cid:3) L system ( 600 by 600 , unless otherwise mentioned ) to be solved for the coefﬁcients C l . The A l were ob - tained as numerical integrals . We ﬁnd that the solution to the truncated sys - tem converges as L increases . As a measure of the convergence of the solution we used the variation of the concentration difference across the membrane . The choice of L ¼ 600 is justiﬁed by Fig . 2 , which indicates that the solution converges for ~ L > 150 for the baseline parameters ; for the slowest converging cases , the error is < 1 % . Thus we see that the approximate solution of Eqs . 4 and 5 provides an accurate solution to the problem . Solution of Model 2 The solution to Model 2 uses the solution for the case C in ¼ (cid:2) C out given in Crank ( 27 ) . We summarize the method used to obtain the solution . The approach uses the correction to the solution that would hold if no hole were present . The sign of the correction is opposite on each side . We thus have C ð r Þ ¼ (cid:4) C in (cid:2) ~ C ð z ; r Þ z < 0 C out þ ~ C ð z ; r Þ z > 0 ; ( 15 ) where ~ C ð z ; r Þ is the correction for z > 0 . At z ¼ 0 , the boundary conditions ( Eq . 9 ) require that C ð r Þ be continuous insidethe hole , while outsidethehole v C = v z ¼ 0 . In termsof the correction , this becomes ~ C ð 0 þ ; r Þ ¼ ð 1 = 2 Þð C in (cid:2) C out Þ for r < a ; (cid:5) v ~ C ð z ; r Þ v z (cid:6) z ¼ 0 ¼ 0 for r > a . Equation 8 for ~ C is solved in the Supporting Material by an expansion in Bessel functions .

This model is expected to reproduce the spherical - model results in certain limits . In the spherical model there is a ﬁnite discontinuity across the hole , while in the planar model , the concentration is continuous . In the spherical model , there is some membrane current outside the patch , whereas in the planar model there is none . Finally , the spherical model has a curved geometry , while that in the planar model is ﬂat . We thus expect the planar model to approximate the spherical one well only if P 1 a = D is large , P 2 R = D is small , and a = R is small . The second and third conditions hold for all our parameter sets , but the ﬁrst holds only at the upper end of the values of P 1 that we have treated . RESULTS Model 1—spherical cell The parameter values are given in Table 1 . We vary q 0 and P 1 because their values are poorly known . In choosing our range of values for q 0 , we note that the radius of the invag - ination is ~ 30 nm , corresponding to q ¼ 0 : 01 , while the radius of the ribosome - free zone around the invagination indicating the presence of F - actin is ~ 100 nm ( 12 ) , corre - sponding to q ¼ 0 : 033 . The value of q 0 is likely not much smaller than the radius of the invagination region , because the turgor pressure needs to be reduced over the whole invagination region . However , portions of the permeable re - gion outside the invagination region can contribute to the turgor pressure reduction in the invagination region . Thus FIGURE 2 Concentration difference at q ¼ 0 versus L , using baseline pa - rameters . L is the numerical cutoff for Eq . 12 , and the plot shows that the results are well converged already when L > 150 .

As a baseline value , we use q 0 ¼ 0 : 02 . We base our range of values of P 1 on P c , the single - chan - nel permeability of a channel protein such as Fps1 in S . cerevisiae , which can transport glycerol to the outside of the cell . We are not aware of experimental estimates of the single - channel permeability of Fps1 or other glyceropor - ins . The value of P c was thus determined as being in the middle of the range of water permeability values quoted in Yang and Verkman ( 28 ) , noting that glycerol permeability values are similar to water permeability values ( 29 ) . To es - timate P 1 from P c , we assume a constant density of chan - nels . The permeability is taken to be P 1 ¼ ð 1 (cid:2) n c A c Þ P 2 þ n c P c z n c P c ; ( 17 ) where n c ¼ N c = A p is the channel number density per unit area and A c is the area per channel . The term with the minus sign is the total area taken up by the channels , and is included to avoid double - counting of the permeability . The second relation holds approximately because P 1 [ P 2 . Our range of P 1 values corresponds to values of the center - to - center channel distance ranging down to 10 nm ; the baseline value of 4 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 2 cm / s corresponds to a spacing of 16 nm . Because the measured global perme - ability values ( 30 ) include the effects of channels such as Fps1 , and P 2 corresponds to regions of the membrane where channels are depleted by clustering into patches in other regions , we choose our value of P 2 at the lower end of the values quoted in Smith ( 31 ) . In choosing D , we assumed a cytoplasmic value 10 times smaller than the water value given in Lide ( 32 ) . This value is somewhat uncertain , and we treat the effects of varying D in the Discussion . The production rate a was obtained by imposing the constraint k B T N A D C ð p Þ ¼ P . We note that because all concentrations in the model are proportional to a , changes in a will not affect fractional reductions in turgor pressure . Fig . 3 a shows the typical behavior of the concentration as a function of radius , going from inside the cell , through the cell membrane r ¼ 3 m m , and continuing outside the cell . Each of the curves shows a dropoff in C approaching the membrane from the inside , with a corresponding feature outside the membrane . This leads to a reduction in the discontinuity D C , which causes a corresponding reduction in the turgor pressure P according to Eq . 2 . As seen in the ﬁgure , the effect is smaller when the patch width q 0 is reduced and larger when P 1 is increased . Fig . 3 b shows D C as function of angle relative to the patch center . The maximum reduction in D C , 31 % , occurs at the center q ¼ 0 of the patch , but the effect is also pronounced for q > q 0 ; at q ¼ q 0 the reduction is 22 % . Thus signiﬁcant local reductions in turgor pressure occur for our baseline param - eter values . a b FIGURE 3 ( a ) Concentration versus radius for various values of q 0 and P 1 .

Local Turgor Pressure Reduction Biophysical Journal 111 , 2747 – 2756 , December 20 , 2016 2751 Fig . 4 a shows the concentration difference reduction as a function of P 1 for a range of values of q 0 . All the curves have a similar shape , with the reduction becoming larger as q 0 increases . Scaling form for concentration difference reduction The model has two small dimensionless parameters : P 2 R = D ¼ 1 : 1 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 3 , and a = R ¼ 1 : 3 q 0 z 0 : 008 (cid:2) 0 : 04 . The smallness of these parameters suggests that the ratio of D C at the center of the patch to D C at the other end of the cell , d c ¼ j D C ð 0 Þ = D C ð p Þ j , might depend only weakly on P 2 and R , provided that a is kept constant . As mentioned above , there is no dependence on a , because increasing a by a certain factor changes both D C ð 0 Þ and D C ð p Þ by the same factor . If P 2 and R have only weak effects on d c , then d c will be determined almost entirely by P 1 , a , and D . There is only one dimensionless combination of these parameters that could enter d c , so a relation of the form d c ¼ f ð P 1 a = D Þ ( 18 ) should hold to high accuracy , where f is an unknown function . This relation makes two predictions : ( 1 ) That d c is independent of P 2 ; we have tested this prediction by increasing and decreasing P 2 by a factor of two , and as ex - pected , found changes of only 0 . 5 % . ( 2 ) If P 50 % 1 is the value of P 1 required to achieve a 50 % reduction in D C , so that d c ¼ 0 : 5 , then P 50 % 1 f 1 = a . Our test of this prediction is given in Fig . 4 b , which shows that the relationship P 50 % 1 ¼ 0 : 44 D = a ( 19 ) holds to an accuracy of 2 % . Model 2—planar geometry Fig . 5 a shows results for Model 2 . It is seen that the concen - tration drops over a range of values of z comparable to the hole width a . We compared these results to those for the spherical model by identifying a with 1 : 3 q 0 R , z with r (cid:2) R , C in with the concentration at the center of the cell , and taking C out ¼ 0 ; the prefactor in a optimized the agree - ment between the models . We also used a large value of P 1 , to optimize agreement with the planar case . The agreement is quite good , with the main difference being that the discon - tinuity D C vanishes in the planar model while it has a small nonzero value in the spherical model . Analytic theory of patch current and reduction in concentration difference For the purposes of ﬁnding a simple formula for the reduc - tion of D C ð 0 Þ in Model 1 , we ﬁrst develop an expression for the total current I through the patch . We calculate I in Model 2 as a starting point . Inspection of Eq . 16 shows that if C ð ~ r ; r Þ is the solution for a hole of radius a , then C ð ~ r = h ; r = h Þ is the solution for a hole of radius h a . In other words , the spatial scale of the solution is proportional to a . Because the current density in the hole is proportional to D v C = v z f a (cid:2) 1 , and the area of the hole is proportional to a 2 , it follows that I f a . Inserting the additional proportion - ality to C in and D , we obtain I ¼ n Da C in ; ( 20 ) where n ¼ 1 . 98 is obtained numerically from the solution given in Eq . 16 . We next calculate the current I through the permeable patch in Model 1 in two limiting cases . We assume that the permeability has the constant value P 1 over a disk of radius a , and the value P 2 outside that disk , and use D C ð p Þ as a measure of the bulk concentration discontinuity . a b FIGURE 4 ( a ) Concentration difference at q ¼ 0 , relative to bulk mem - brane value , versus permeability .

Scher - Zagier and Carlsson 2752 Biophysical Journal 111 , 2747 – 2756 , December 20 , 2016 In the limit of low permeability P 1 a = D (cid:5) 1 , D C should be constant over the interior surface of the cell , because diffusion will eliminate concentration gradients . Then I ¼ P 1 p a 2 D C ð p Þ . In the high - permeability limit P 1 a = D [ 1 , the planar model is applicable , and we use Eq . 20 . We identify C in in Eq . 20 with D C ð p Þ , because the concentration outside the cell at q ¼ p is very small , so that C x D C . Thus I ¼ n Da D C ð p Þ . To construct a formula for intermediate values of P 1 a = D , we view osmolytes ﬂowing through the patch as experi - encing two resistances in series , corresponding to diffusion to the patch and subsequent permeation of the patch . Each process is deﬁned by a resistance D C ð p Þ = I . The resistance to diffusion is the total resistance for very large P 1 , which from the discussion above is 1 = n Da . Similarly the resistance to permeation is obtained by taking P 1 a = D very small , and equals 1 = P 1 p a 2 . Adding the resistances , we obtain D C ð p Þ = I ¼ 1 = n Da þ 1 = P 1 p a 2 , or I ¼ D C ð p Þ n P 1 D p a 2 n D þ P 1 p a : ( 21 ) Finally , I is related to D C , the average of D C over the permeable patch . By the deﬁnition of the permeability , I ¼ p a 2 P 1 D C . Putting this into Eq . 21 , we have D C D C ð p Þ ¼ 1 1 þ p P 1 a n D : ( 22 ) As seen in Fig . 5 b , this formula gives an excellent descrip - tion of the simulation results , provided that we use a ﬁtted value of n ¼ 2 : 9 . It emphasizes the role of the key dimen - sionless parameter P 1 a = D . DISCUSSION Extent of turgor pressure reduction in yeast To evaluate the potential relevance of local turgor pressure reduction to endocytosis in yeast , we estimate a plausible value of P 1 . Superresolution imaging of aquaporin clusters in brain cells ( 33 ) found an area of 36 nm 2 per aquaporin , corresponding to a center - to - center spacing of 6 nm . Because endocytic protein patches contain a number of other membrane proteins , we use a conservative estimate of a 10 nm center - to - center spacing , corresponding to a channel density n c of 10 12 cm (cid:2) 2 . Taking the single - channel permeability to be 10 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 13 cm (cid:2) 3 ( Table 1 ) , we ﬁnd P 1 ¼ 0 : 1 cm = s . Above in Fig . 4 b , we found that for this value of P 1 , a 50 % reduction in the turgor pressure will occur as long as the patch radius is 45 nm or greater . Thus patches only slightly larger than the invagination size can reduce the turgor pressure signiﬁcantly . A patch of 45 nm would contain ~ 60 channels . This number is comparable to the counts of the coat proteins known to be important for endocytosis in budding yeast . For example , the maximum count of the linker protein Sla2 is ~ 50 ( 34 ) . In addition , this channel cluster size is similar in magnitude to the 35 - channel aquaporin clusters previously observed in Smith and Verkman ( 33 ) . Equation 22 shows that the turgor pressure reduction is enhanced if D is smaller than the value given in Table 1 . It will also be enhanced if diffusion in the cell wall outside the membrane is slower than in the cytoplasm . Because treat - ing a cell wall with ﬁnite thickness would be signiﬁcantly more complicated than the calculations we have done , we instead have considered a model in which the diffusion coefﬁcient is reduced uniformly outside the membrane . This corresponds to changing the boundary conditions in Eqs . 7 . We ﬁnd that if the outside value of the diffusion coef - ﬁcient is reduced by 50 % , P 50 % is reduced by 55 % . For the turgor pressure reduction to facilitate endocytosis , it must persist when the membrane is bent inward , up to the a b FIGURE 5 ( a ) Planar model concentration ( black ) and spherical model concentration ( blue ) along line through center of hole / patch , for P 1 ¼ 1 : 0 cm = s and a ¼ 1 : 3 q 0 R ¼ 78 nm .

Local Turgor Pressure Reduction Biophysical Journal 111 , 2747 – 2756 , December 20 , 2016 2753 point where a tubule forms and late - arriving curvature - generating proteins assist the process . We see no mathemat - ically practical way of performing the calculations for an inward - bent membrane . However , we note that diffusion currents in general are much more sensitive to the maximum size of their target than to its shape . For example , the diffu - sion current to a perfectly absorbing cylindrically symmet - ric ellipsoid of semimajor axis a and semiminor axis b , with a [ b , differs from the current to a perfect absorbing sphere of radius a by only a logarithmic factor of ð 1 = ln ð 2 a = b ÞÞ ( 35 ) ; the current to a disk of radius a differs from that to a sphere of radius a by only a factor of ð 2 = p Þ ( 27 ) . Therefore the current I from the inside of the cell through the permeable patch should depend mainly on the maximum dimension of the patch rather than its deforma - tion . Further , I ¼ N c P c D C , where N c is the number of chan - nels , P c is the single - channel permeability , and D C is the average concentration difference across the membrane over the area of the patch . If N c and P c are constant , then D C will also be relatively independent of patch deformation . Thus the turgor pressure reduction will persist even when the membrane is bent inwards , until it forms a tubule . The presence of permeable patches can also cause a substantial decrease in the bulk turgor pressure if a is unaffected by the patches . Using the maximum estimate of P 1 ¼ 0 : 1 cm = s , together with the corresponding patch radius of 45 nm , we ﬁnd a global turgor pressure reduction of 52 % . This does not affect our key results because we focus on the ratio of the turgor pressure at the permeable patch to that in other parts of the cell . Because the perme - able patch is small , the measured turgor pressure corre - sponds to the calculated value away from the patch . The effect on the bulk turgor pressure will be reduced if P 2 is larger than is assumed in Table 1 , because a lower fraction of the total osmolyte current will ﬂow through the patch . It will also be reduced if D is smaller , because this reduces the required values of P 1 and a , according to Eq . 19 . Relation to experiments We are not aware of experiments currently in the literature that can test the hypothesis of local turgor pressure reduc - tion in yeast . However , the efﬁciency of invagination is greatly reduced in deletion mutants of the channel Fps1 ( 9 ) , an effect that could increase turgor pressure either locally or globally . Fps1 localizes in membrane patches ( 25 ) . To establish the extent of channel clustering at endo - cytic sites , one could use two - color ﬂuorescence imaging to measure colocalization of Fps1 and with endocytosis markers such as the early scaffold protein Ede1 or the polymerized - actin proxy Abp1 . Colocalization of channel patches with endocytic proteins would indicate that the turgor pressure is locally reduced around the endocytic site . Appearance of the channels before Ede1 would suggest that the channels have a function in marking the endocytic site . On the other hand , appearance of the channels after Abp1 could mean that polymerized actin is important for recruiting the channels . Such a possibility is suggested by the documented effects of polymerized actin on channel dy - namics in other types of cells ( 36 – 38 ) . If the channel patches do colocalize with endocytic sites , superresolution measure - ments of the distribution of channels could provide a con - crete test of our hypothesis . Previous experiments have demonstrated that the effect described here , variations of osmotic pressure difference across the membrane caused by variations in channel den - sity , does function on larger spatial scales . For example , segregation of aquaporins and Na þ / H þ channels to the lead - ing edge of cancer cells led to osmolyte concentration gra - dients over the length of the cell , which in turn created internal pressure gradients that drove migration through artiﬁcial channels ( 39 ) . Here we predict that gradients of osmolytes over much smaller distances , caused by higher densities of channels , will lead to osmotic pressure varia - tions over these smaller distances . Application to plant cells The high turgor pressure in plants also poses conceptual difﬁculties in rationalizing the mechanobiology of endocy - tosis , and some early articles actually doubted the existence of the process for this reason ( 40 , 41 ) . Endocytosis in plants has some parallels to the process in yeast , in particular its polymerized - actin dependence ( 42 , 43 ) . The difﬁculties of overcoming high turgor pressure in plants by an actin - dependent process might thus be eased by a local turgor pressure reduction mechanism like that we discuss here for yeast . Alternative mechanisms Several other possible mechanisms might deal with the difﬁculty of generating sufﬁcient force via actin polymeri - zation and curvature - generating proteins . A calculation based on the total number of type - I myosins in ﬁssion yeast ( 10 ) , assuming that each one can generate 2 pN of force , suggested that they could overcome the turgor pressure , but only over a smaller region of radius 10 nm . The geomet - ric arrangement of myosins that would supply forces with the correct orientation and distribution is also not known . One possibility is that the myosins turn actin ﬁlaments into ‘‘superpolymerizers’’ by 1 ) binding the ﬁlaments to the membrane and 2 ) moving to the growing tip of the actin ﬁlament after each polymerization event , keeping it far enough from the membrane that new subunits can be added freely ( 44 ) . In this hypothesis , myosins act somewhat like formins , which drive processive elongation of actin ﬁla - ments while bound to the membrane . An alternate possibil - ity is one analogous to tubulation of giant unilamellar vesicles driven by type - 1 myosin ( 45 ) , where the driving Scher - Zagier and Carlsson 2754 Biophysical Journal 111 , 2747 – 2756 , December 20 , 2016 force for tubulation came from myosin motion along a pre - existing actin scaffold . We are not aware of measurements of the force - generating capability of yeast type - 1 myosins , but mammalian type - 1 myosins are able to generate up to 5 pN of force per molecule ( 46 ) . It is also possible that there are growing actin ﬁlaments that were not detected in the pre - vious ﬁlament counts based on Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated branching ( 20 , 23 ) . These could , for example , be generated by domains on the actin nucleator Las - 17 that act indepen - dently of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 47 ) . It has also been suggested that polymerization of actin ﬁl - aments along the membrane could generate much larger forces in a wedgelike geometry ( 48 ) . The transmission of such forces to the membrane would require a very stiff actin gel ( 4 ) . There is no proof that a gel with such properties ex - ists , but the high cross - linking fraction in endocytic actin patches could make them much stiffer than other forms of polymerized actin . Another possibility is that curvature - generating proteins could be providing a very large fraction , say 90 % , of the force overcoming turgor pressure . However , if this were the case , one would expect that the large heterogeneity be - tween cells , and between endocytic events in the same cell , would often lead to the curvature - generating proteins exerting sufﬁcient force to drive the process by themselves , in the absence of actin polymerization . Correlative electron - microscopy and light - microscopy experiments ( 12 ) have shown that this is not the case : substantial membrane defor - mation seldom or never occurs without polymerized actin . Finally , the global turgor pressure could be overesti - mated . The turgor pressure is typically measured indirectly ( 15 ) , by exposing the cell to increasing solute concentra - tions and measuring the volume change . The turgor pressure is proportional to the minimal external solute concentration increase that causes the cell wall to collapse , on the assump - tion that the membrane collapses at zero turgor pressure . These methods could overestimate the turgor pressure because cells react to increasing external solute concentra - tion by increasing the internal solute concentration , thus requiring higher external concentrations for collapse ( 25 ) . Osmoregulation could also confound mechanically based turgor pressure measurements ( 16 ) , if internal osmolytes are upregulated in response to force opposing cell growth . Direct methods using an indentor that penetrates the cell wall are impractical in yeast because of the small system size . But experiments in plant cells ( 14 ) have shown good consistency between indirect and direct methods . Therefore , for the global turgor pressure in yeast to be strongly overes - timated , osmoregulation mechanisms in yeast would have to be more efﬁcient than in plants .
