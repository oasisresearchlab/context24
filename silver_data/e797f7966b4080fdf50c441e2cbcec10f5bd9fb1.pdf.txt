Brief Communication 719 Integrin engagement suppresses RhoA activity via a c - Src - dependent mechanism William T . Arthur * , Leslie A . Petch * and Keith Burridge * † The Rho family GTPases Cdc42 , Rac1 and RhoA control many of the changes in the actin cytoskeleton that are triggered when growth factor receptors and integrins bind their ligands [ 1 , 2 ] . Rac1 and Cdc42 stimulate the formation of protrusive structures such as membrane ruffles , lamellipodia and filopodia . RhoA regulates contractility and assembly of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions . Although prolonged integrin engagement can stimulate RhoA [ 3 – 5 ] , regulation of this GTPase by early integrin - mediated signals is poorly understood . Here we show that integrin engagement initially inactivates RhoA , in a c - Src - dependent manner , but has no effect on Cdc42 or Rac1 activity . Additionally , early integrin signaling induces activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP via a mechanism that requires c - Src . Dynamic modulation of RhoA activity appears to have a role in motility , as both inhibition and activation of RhoA hinder migration [ 6 – 8 ] . Transient suppression of RhoA by integrins may alleviate contractile forces that would otherwise impede protrusion at the leading edge of migrating cells .

Results and discussion In response to ligation by extracellular matrix ( ECM ) pro - teins , integrins transmit signals that initiate rearrange - ments in the actin cytoskeleton [ 2 ] . Numerous studies have shown that these cytoskeletal changes are mediated by Rho family proteins [ 1 ] . The signaling pathways by which integrins regulate these GTPases are not well char - acterized , however . To study how early integrin - mediated signals regulate RhoA , we measured RhoA activity in cells stimulated with GRGDSP peptides ( RGD , single - letter amino - acid notation ) which mimic the integrin - binding region found in the ECM proteins vitronectin and fibronectin . RhoA activity was measured by affinity pre - cipitation of active ( GTP - bound ) RhoA from cell lysates using a GST ( glutathione - S - transferase ) fusion protein containing the Rho - binding domain of its effector , Rhotekin [ 9 ] . Ren et al . showed RhoA is transiently inhib - ited prior to its activation during integrin - mediated adhe - sion to fibronectin [ 9 ] . We obtained equivalent results by stimulating suspended BALB / c3T3 fibroblasts and Rat1 cells with RGD ( data not shown ) . Here , we examine the signaling events responsible for this inhibition of RhoA . Several integrin - stimulated signals are transmitted by members of the Src family tyrosine kinases ( SFKs ) [ 10 ] . SFKs are transiently activated during integrin - mediated adhesion [ 11 ] and have an important role in cell spreading and migration [ 10 ] . Cells lacking one or more SFKs exhibit reduced motility [ 10 , 12 , 13 ] , which may be attrib - uted to their inability to turn over focal adhesions or to misregulation of Rho family proteins [ 14 , 15 ] . Constitu - tively active RhoA reverts v - Src - induced disruption of stress fibers [ 15 ] , supporting a role for SFKs in the regula - tion of Rho proteins . These findings suggest that SFKs may mediate the inhibition of RhoA by integrins . We investigated the role of SFKs in integrin - triggered inhi - bition of RhoA by examining the response to RGD stimu - lation in cells lacking c - Src , Yes and Fyn ( SYF cells ) , and in SYF cells re - expressing c - Src ( c - Src - expressing cells ) [ 13 ] . Upon treatment with RGD , RhoA activity in c - Src - express - ing cells decreased from basal to nearly undetectable levels by 15 minutes ( Figure 1 ) and returned to baseline by 30 minutes ( data not shown ) . In SYF cells , however , RGD failed to suppress RhoA activity . Given that fibronectin - or vitronectin - coated beads bind equally to c - Src - null and control cells [ 16 ] , the inability of SYF cells to respond to RGD is unlikely to be due to a defect in integrin binding . To further explore the role of SFKs in early integrin signal - ing , we inhibited SFKs by treating cells with PP1 , an inhibitor of SFKs [ 17 ] , or by transiently overexpressing c - Src kinase ( Csk ) , a negative regulator of SFKs [ 10 ] . Inhi - bition of SFKs by either of these methods blocked the transient inhibition of RhoA that results from the addition of RGD to Rat1 cells ( data not shown ) . Taken together , these data suggest that c - Src is essential for transmitting an early inhibitory signal from engaged integrins to RhoA . One possible mechanism by which c - Src - mediated integrin signaling may modulate RhoA activity is by cross - talk between members of the Rho family . Given that v - Src induces a Rac1 - and Cdc42 - like protrusive phenotype [ 10 ] and that Rac1 can inhibit RhoA [ 18 ] , a plausible mechanism is that stimulation of c - Src by integrin engagement activates Cdc42 or Rac1 and that effectors of these GTPases inhibit RhoA . To test this hypothesis , we measured the levels of active Cdc42 and Rac1 [ 19 ] in c - Src - expressing cells treated with RGD . We found that , in contrast to its effect on RhoA activity , RGD treatment did not alter the activity of either Cdc42 or Rac1 over a similar time course ( Figure 1 ) . These data suggest that neither Cdc42 nor Rac1 have a role in integrin - mediated inhibition of RhoA . A second pathway by which c - Src - dependent integrin sig - naling could inhibit RhoA is through activation of p190RhoGAP [ 1 ] . In vivo , this GAP ( GTPase activating protein ) potentiates the intrinsic GTPase activity of RhoA rendering it inactive [ 20 ] . To explore the role of p190RhoGAP in signaling by early integrin engagement , we first measured its activity using an in vitro GAP assay [ 15 ] . Relative to untreated cells , RGD stimulated a significant ( p < 0 . 003 ) increase in RhoA - directed GAP activity by p190RhoGAP immunoprecipitates from c - Src - expressing cells ( Figure 2a ) . In contrast , RGD failed to sig - nificantly ( p > 0 . 4 ) alter the activity of p190RhoGAP recovered from SYF cells . These findings suggest that inte - grin engagement stimulates p190RhoGAP activity through a mechanism that requires c - Src . Although the regulation of p190RhoGAP is not well under - stood , its tyrosine phosphorylation and specific localization correlate with its presumed activation . p190RhoGAP is thought to mediate stress fiber disassembly in response to stimulation with epidermal growth factor or expression of v - Src or constitutively active c - Src [ 15 , 21 , 22 ] . This disas - sembly is accompanied by p190RhoGAP tyrosine phos - phorylation ( [ 21 , 22 ] and V . J . Fincham , A . Chudleigh , M . C . Frame , personal communication ) and localization to sites lacking stress fibers [ 22 ] . Nakahara and colleagues demonstrated that , like growth factor receptors , integrins also stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP and its localization to membrane protrusions devoid of stress fibers [ 23 ] . A reasonable explanation for the require - ment of c - Src in p190RhoGAP activation by integrins is that c - Src or a c - Src - activated tyrosine kinase phosphory - lates , and thereby activates , p190RhoGAP . To test this hypothesis , we examined levels of p190RhoGAP tyrosine phosphorylation in response to integrin engagement . We found that treatment with RGD resulted in increased tyro - sine phosphorylation of p190RhoGAP in c - Src - expressing cells but not in SYF cells ( Figure 2b ) . These data , along with our GAP assay results , show that p190RhoGAP activa - tion in response to integrin engagement correlates with its c - Src - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation . To further define the role of p190RhoGAP in RhoA inhibition by integrins , we expressed a GAP - deficient p190RhoGAP mutant ( p190RhoGAP R1283A ) tagged with the hemagglutinin ( HA ) epitope [ 24 ] in c - Src expressing cells . We found that expression of this mutant perturbed RhoA inactivation in response to RGD stimulation ( Figure 3 ) . These data indicate that p190RhoGAP R1283A – HA interferes with the function of the endogenous protein , and that p190RhoGAP is necessary for RhoA inhibition in response to early integrin signaling . In this study , we investigated the regulation of Rho family proteins by integrin signaling events that precede integrin clustering and focal adhesion formation . Using RGD - con - taining peptides that mimic the integrin - binding region of fibronectin and vitronectin , we found that integrin engage - ment initially inhibited the activity of RhoA through a c - Src - dependent mechanism . Integrin engagement stimu - lated c - Src - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and activa - tion of p190RhoGAP . In addition , RGD - induced inhibition of RhoA was antagonized by expression of a GAP - deficient p190RhoGAP mutant . We propose a signal - ing pathway in which , following engagement , integrins 720 Current Biology Vol 10 No 12 Figure 1 Integrin engagement inhibits the activity of RhoA , but not Cdc42 or Rac1 , in a c - Src - dependent manner . c - Src - expressing cells ( c - Src ) or SYF cells ( SYF ) were suspended for 2 h in serum - free media . Integrins were engaged by the addition of GRGDSP peptides ( RGD ) ( Life Technologies ) to 250 m g / ml for 0 , 1 , 5 , 10 or 15 min or treated with GRGESP ( RGE ) for 15 min ( a control for nonspecific binding ) . Cells were also plated on 50 m g / ml fibronectin for 30 min or treated with 100 ng / ml bradykinin for 7 min as positive controls ( + ) for Rac1 and Cdc42 activity , respectively . Active GTP - bound RhoA , Cdc42 and Rac1 were precipitated from cell lysates as described previously [ 9 , 19 ] . Precipitated proteins ( active ) and cell lysates ( total ) were immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) recognizing RhoA , Cdc42 or Rac1 ( all antibodies were purchased from Transductions Laboratories , unless otherwise noted ) .

Activated p190RhoGAP then increases RhoA GTPase activity , rendering RhoA inactive by converting it to a GDP - bound state . An initial localized suppression of RhoA activity by inte - grin engagement may be a critical step that allows cells to spread or migrate . RhoA - mediated contractile forces might otherwise impede protrusion , or collapse existing protrusive structures , at the leading edge of migrating cells . In fact , blocking RhoA signaling has been shown to promote protrusions in the form of membrane ruffles [ 25 ] . Inhibition of RhoA by integrins via c - Src and p190RhoGAP may also contribute to focal adhesion disas - sembly at the rear of motile cells . The importance of posi - tive and negative regulation of RhoA is underscored by the finding that both activation and inhibition of RhoA sup - press migration [ 6 – 8 ] . These results , together with our findings that integrin engagement inhibits RhoA via c - Src , provide a plausible explanation for the defect in spreading and migration exhibited by cells lacking c - Src or c - Src , Yes and Fyn [ 11 – 13 ] . Future studies aim to determine the signaling events that activate RhoA follow - ing its transient inhibition by integrin engagement via c - Src and p190RhoGAP .
