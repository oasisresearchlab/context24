Designing such a program requires commitments about what knowledge is and how it is obtained . T hus , some of the major traditional problems of philosophy arise in artificial intelligence . More specifically , we want a computer program that decides what to do by inferring in a formal language that a certain strategy will achieve its assigned goal . T his requires formalizing concepts of causality , ability , and knowledge . Such formalisms are also considered in philosophical logic . T he first part of the paper begins with a philosophical point of view that seems to arise naturally once we take seriously the idea of actually making an intelligent machine .

A proposed resolution of the problem of freewill in a deterministic universe and of counterfactual conditional sentences is presented . T he second part is mainly concerned with formalisms within which it can be proved that a strategy will achieve a goal . Concepts of situation , fluent , future operator , action , strategy , result of a strategy and knowledge are formalized . A method is given of constructing a sentence of first - order logic which will be true in all models of certain axioms if and only if a certain strategy will achieve a certain goal . T he formalism of this paper represents an advance over McCarthy ( 1963 ) and Green ( 1969 ) in that it permits proof of the correctness of strategies that contain loops and strategies that involve the acquisition of knowledge ; and it is also somewhat more concise . T he third part discusses open problems in extending the formalism of part 2 . T he fourth part is a review of work in philosophical logic in relation to problems of artificial intelligence and a discussion of previous efforts to program â€˜general intelligenceâ€™ from the point of view of this paper .
