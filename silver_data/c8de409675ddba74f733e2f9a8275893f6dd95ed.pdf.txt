Despite this fundamental role in eukaryotic cell biology , we lack a 24 phylogenetically - comprehensive understanding of chromatin evolution . Here , we combine com - 25 parative proteomics and genomics analysis of chromatin in eukaryotes and archaea . Proteomics 26 uncovers the existence of histone post - translational modifications in Archaea . However , archaeal 27 histone modifications are scarce , in contrast with the highly conserved and abundant marks we 28 identify across eukaryotes . Phylogenetic analysis reveals that chromatin - associated catalytic func - 29 tions ( e . g . , methyltransferases ) have pre - eukaryotic origins , whereas histone mark readers and 30 chaperones are eukaryotic innovations . We show that further chromatin evolution is characterized 31 by expansion of readers , including capture by transposable elements and viruses . Overall , our study 32 infers detailed evolutionary history of eukaryotic chromatin : from its archaeal roots , through the 33 emergence of nucleosome - based regulation in the eukaryotic ancestor , to the diversification of 34 chromatin regulators and their hijacking by genomic parasites . 35 36 37 2 Introduction 38 The access to genetic information in eukaryotes is controlled by a manifold nucleoproteic interface 39 called chromatin . This nucleosomal chromatin environment defines a repressive ground state for 40 transcription and other DNA - templated processes in eukaryotic genomes 1 , 2 . Multiple components 41 associated with chromatin underlie elaborate eukaryotic genome regulation , allowing the differen - 42 tial access to genetic information in time / space and the maintenance of the resulting regulatory 43 states 3 – 6 . Moreover , chromatin - based regulation is essential in repressing parasitic genomic ele - 44 ments , like transposons and viruses 7 – 11 . 45 The main protein components of eukaryotic chromatin are histones . All eukaryotes have four major 46 types of histones ( H2A , H2B , H3 and H4 ) , which are combined as an octamer to form the basic 47 repetitive unit of the chromatin : the nucleosome . Canonical histones are among the most highly 48 conserved proteins across eukaryotes 12 and , in addition , unique histone variants ( paralogs of one of 49 the four major histone types ) are found in many species , often associated with particular regulatory 50 states 13 – 17 . Histone chemical modifications , including acetylations and methylations play a central 51 role in genome regulation and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance 3 , 18 – 21 . These chemical moie - 52 ties , known as histone post - translational modifications ( hPTMs ) , are added and removed by specific 53 enzymes ( ‘writers’ , e . g . , histone methyltransferases or acetylases ; and ‘erasers’ , e . g . , histone 54 demethylases and deacetylases ) . Some hPTMs ( e . g . , most acetylations ) have a generic effect on 55 nucleosome stability , while others are bound by specific proteins or protein complexes . These are 56 often referred to as ‘readers’ and include proteins like HP1 , which binds to H3K9me3 , as well as a 57 myriad of other proteins encoding Chromo , PHD , Tudor and Bromo structural domains , among oth - 58 ers 22 – 24 . Finally , nucleosome remodellers ( like SNF2 proteins ) and histone chaperones are additional 59 important players in chromatin regulation , by mediating chromatin opening , nucleosomal assembly , 60 and histone variant interchanges 25 – 28 . 61 All eukaryotes studied to date possess histone - based chromatin organization , with the sole excep - 62 tion of dinoflagellates , which nonetheless encode for histone proteins in their genomes 29 . Beyond 63 eukaryotes , histones have also been identified in Archaea , where they have been shown to form 64 nucleosomal structures 30 – 33 . However , unlike eukaryotic histones , the few archaeal histones experi - 65 mentally characterized so far ( i ) generally lack disordered N - terminal tails ; ( ii ) do not have any 66 known post - translational modifications 34 ; and ( iii ) do not seem to impose a widespread , genome - 67 wide repressive transcriptional ground state 33 , 35 . Thus , chromatin - based elaborate genome regula - 68 tion is often considered a eukaryotic innovation 36 , 37 . 69 From a phylogenetic perspective , our understanding of chromatin components and processes de - 70 rives from a very small set of organisms , essentially animal , fungal and plant model species plus a 71 few parasitic unicellular eukaryotes . Additional efforts have sampled specific aspects of chromatin 72 regulation , such as histone modifications or their genome - wide distribution , in non - model animal 73 species 38 , 39 , fungi ( Neurospora crassa and Fusarium graminearum ) 40 , 41 , and five other eukaryotes : 74 the unicellular holozoan Capsaspora owczarzaki 42 , the dinoflagellate Hematodiunium sp . 29 , the 75 brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus 43 , the amoebozoan Dictyostelium discoideum 44 , and the ciliate 76 Tetrahymena thermophila 45 , 46 . However , these organisms represent a tiny fraction of eukaryotic 77 3 diversity . Hence , we lack a systematic understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic chromatin mod - 78 ifications and components 47 . 79 In order to infer the origin and evolutionary diversification of eukaryotic chromatin , we performed a 80 joint comparative analysis of histone proteomics data from 30 different eukaryotic and archaeal 81 taxa , including new data for 23 species . In parallel , we analyzed the complement of chromatin - 82 associated gene families in an additional 172 eukaryotic genomes and transcriptomes . This compre - 83 hensive taxon sampling includes representatives of all major eukaryotic lineages , as well as multiple 84 free - living members of enigmatic early - branching eukaryotes ( e . g . , jakobids , malawimonads , 85 Meteora sp . and ancyromonads , as well as Collodictyonida , Rigifilida and Mantamonadida 86 ( CRuMS ) ; Fig . 1a ) . In addition , in order to trace the pre - eukaryotic origins of these chromatin gene 87 families , we systematically searched for orthologs in archaeal , bacterial and viral genomes . Specifi - 88 cally , we reconstructed the evolutionary history of enzymes involved in chromatin modification and 89 remodelling ; as well as the conservation of the hPTMs effected by these enzymes . Our comparative 90 genomics and proteomics suggest a concurrent and early origin of canonical histones , a core of qua - 91 si - universal hPTMs , and their corresponding enzymatic effectors . We also identify independent ex - 92 pansions in hPTM reader gene families across eukaryotes and document evidence of the capture of 93 these reader domains by parasitic genomic elements . Overall , this work provides a 94 phylogenetically - informed framework to classify and compare chromatin components across the 95 eukaryotic tree of life , and to further investigate the evolution of hPTM - mediated genome regula - 96 tion . 97 Results 98 Comparative proteomics of eukaryotic histone post - translational modifications . 99 We analyzed the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary history of histone proteins . To this end , 100 we surveyed the presence of histone - fold proteins across 172 eukaryotic and 4 , 226 archaeal taxa , 101 using HMM searches ( Fig . 1a , b and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Histone proteins are found in all 102 eukaryotic genomes . We clustered the identified 8 , 576 histone - encoding proteins using pairwise 103 local alignments and then classified individual sequences in these clusters based on pairwise align - 104 ments to a reference database 48 ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . This reveals four broad clus - 105 ters corresponding to the four main eukaryotic histones ( H2A , H2B , H3 , and H4 ) and their variants 106 ( H2A . Z , macroH2A , and cenH3 ) , as well as a fifth cluster composed of archaeal HMfB homologs . 107 Finally , this classification also uncovers three large connected components composed of transcrip - 108 tion factors with histone - like DNA binding domains , which are widely distributed in eukaryotes 109 ( POLE3 , POLE4 , DR1 ) and / or archaea ( NFYB ) . Further analysis of the genomic distribution of 110 these histone genes shows a frequent occurrence of H3 - H4 and H2A - H2B pairs in head - to - head 111 orientation ( 5 ' to 5 ' ) , strongly indicating co - regulation across eukaryotes ( Supplementary Fig . 1b , c 112 and Supplementary Table 2 ) . 113 Next , we investigated the distribution and conservation of hPTMs across major eukaryotic groups 114 and Archaea , including methylations , acetylations , crotonylations , phosphorylations , and 115 ubiquitylations . To this end , histones from 19 different eukaryotic species were extracted , chemical - 116 ly derivatized 49 and analyzed by mass - spectrometry ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Table 3 ) , adding 117 4 to previously available hPTM proteomics data for additional seven species . Our extensive taxon 118 sampling covers all major eukaryotic groups , as well as hitherto unsampled early - diverging eukary - 119 otic lineages—such as the malawimonad Gefionella okellyi , the discoban Naegleria gruberi , or the 120 ancyromonad Fabomonas tropica — , thus providing a comprehensive comparative framework for 121 evolutionary inference . 122 We focused first on hPTMs present in canonical histones , as defined by their highly conserved N - 123 terminal regions , phylogenetic analyses , and sequence similarity to curated reference canonical his - 124 tones ( Fig . 1d ; see Methods ) . hPTMs are detected in all canonical histones from all species . After 125 correcting by sequence coverage , we observe that hPTMs are particularly abundant in H3 canonical 126 histones ( median = 23 . 5 hPTMs per species , mean = 24 . 3 ) , compared with H2A , H2B and H4 ( me - 127 dians between 6 . 5 and 9 , means between 9 . 5 and 13 . 4 ; Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . Holozoan canoni - 128 cal H2As ( Homo sapiens , Sycon ciliatum and Capsaspora owczarzaki ) represent an exception to 129 this trend and contain similar number of modifications to H3s in these species . We also examined 130 the reproducibility of hPTM detection across replicate samples , showing that the majority of hPTMs 131 ( 87 . 5 % ) can be found in more than one sample ( Supplementary Fig . 2b , c ) . Despite this , it is worth 132 emphasizing that our data may contain false negatives , beyond the lack of coverage for particular 133 residues that we systematically report . For example , some marks might be globally too scarce in the 134 nucleosomes of a particular species , while other modifications like phosphorylations and 135 ubiquitination are difficult to detect by mass - spectrometry without dedicated peptide - enrichment 136 protocols . 137 Canonical H3 and H4 N - terminal tails contain the majority of phylogenetically - conserved hPTMs , 138 in stark contrast with the relative paucity of conserved hPTMs in canonical H2A and H2B . A strik - 139 ing example of paneukaryotic conservation comes from the acetylation of the H4 K5 , K8 , K12 and 140 K16 residues ( Fig . 1d , second panel ) , all of which mark gene expression - permissive chromatin en - 141 vironments in multiple eukaryotic species 22 . A similar conservation pattern is observed in the acety - 142 lation of a group of N - terminal H3 lysines ( K9 , K14 , K18 , K23 , K27 ) associated with similar func - 143 tions , while other H3 acetylations are only found in a few species ( e . g . , residues K4 , K56 and K79 ) . 144 While acetylations are highly conserved , only seven histone H3 / H4 methylations are broadly con - 145 served across eukaryotic lineages : H3K4me1 / 2 / 3 , H3K9me1 / 2 / 3 , H3K27me1 / 2 / 3 , H3K36me1 / 2 / 3 , 146 H3K37me1 / 2 / 3 and , more sparsely , H3K79me1 / 2 and H4K20me1 . Many of these broadly con - 147 served marks have conserved roles in demarcating active ( e . g . , H3K4me ) and repressive chromatin 148 states ( e . g . , H3K9me and H3K27me ) 22 , 42 , 50 . The scarcity of conserved hPTMs in H2A and H2B 149 canonical histones can partially explained by their higher degree of sequence divergence ( Fig . 1e ) , 150 which is reflected in many non - homologous lysine residues ( Fig . 1d ) . But even among homologous 151 positions , we found little evidence of conservation , with the exception of H2A K5ac ( associated to 152 active promoters 51 ) and , in fewer species , methylation of H2A K5 and H2B K5 . Finally , we were 153 also able to identify phosphorylations in serine and threonine residues and a few instances of 154 ubiquitylation . In general , these marks show more restricted phylogenetic distributions than lysine 155 acetylation or methylation , even in the tightly conserved H3 and H4 histones . We can identify con - 156 served phosphorylations in H2A T120 and S122 , which are shared by most opisthokonts , and the 157 ubiquitylation of H2A K119 only in some holozoan species . 158 5 Mass - spectrometry analysis detected histone variants in all species included in our study , suggesting 159 that they are relatively abundant in the chromatin of these eukaryotes ( Fig . 1e ) . Most of these vari - 160 ants are lineage - specific , with the exception of the paneukaryotic variants H2A . Z , H3 / cenH3 and 161 H3 . 3 ; and the macroH2A variant found in holozoans and Meteora sp . ( belonging to an orphan eu - 162 karyotic lineage ) . Interestingly , we find hPTMs in the vast majority of detected variants , both con - 163 served and lineage - specific , particularly acetylations and methylations ( Fig . 1e and Supplemen - 164 tary Fig . 2d ) . Overall , our comparative proteomic analysis suggests the existence of a highly con - 165 served set of canonical hPTMs of ancestral eukaryotic origin in H3 and H4 , which co - exists with 166 less conserved hPTMs in H2A , H2B , and lineage - specific modifications in variant histones . 167 168 Archaeal histones and histone post - translational modifications 169 In contrast with the paneukaryotic distribution of histones , sequence searches show that only a frac - 170 tion of archaeal genomes encode for histones ( 28 . 1 % of the taxa here examined ; Fig . 2a ) . Archaeal 171 histones exhibit a patchy phylogenetic distribution , similar to other gene families shared with eu - 172 karyotes 52 . Among others , histones are present in Euryarchaeota , the TACK superphylum and 173 Asgard archaea 12 , 53 – 56 . Asgard are generally are considered to be the closest known archaeal rela - 174 tives of eukaryotes 57 , 58 , although this sister - group relationship has been challenged by some 175 studies 59 . Our extended sampling revealed that Asgard archaea histones , particularly in the 176 Lokiarchaeota and Heimdallarchaeota clades 55 , often have lysine - rich N - terminal tails in the manner 177 of eukaryotic histones ( Fig . 2a - c ) . These Asgard histones appear to be conserved across multiple 178 taxa , albeit without direct sequence similarity compared to canonical eukaryotic histones ( Supple - 179 mentary Fig . 1d ) . When compared against eukaryotic sequences classified in HistoneDB 48 , these 180 archaeal histones clearly cluster in a separate group and are most similar to either eukaryotic H4 or , 181 to a lesser degree , H3 canonical histones , in line with previous findings 12 , 55 , 60 . 182 To identify potential archaeal hPTMs , we performed proteomics analysis of histones in three 183 Euryarchaeota ( the Methanobacteriota Methanobrevibacter cuticularis and the Halobacteriota 184 Methanospirillum stamsii and Methanosarcina spelaei ) and one Thaumarchaeota species 185 ( Nitrososphaera viennensis ; Fig . 2b ) . Mass - spectrometry detects histone proteins in all of them : 2 - 4 186 in the euryarchaeotes ( with 27 - 90 % protein coverage ) and one in the thaumarchaeote ( 80 % protein 187 coverage ) , including homologs with N - terminal tails encoded by each of the three euryarchaeotes in 188 our survey ( 22 - 40 aa , 0 . 09 - 28 lysines per residue ; Fig . 2c ) . Moreover , this proteomics analysis finds 189 evidence of hPTMs in archaeal histones . However , in comparison with eukaryotic histones , hPTMs 190 are extremely scarce in archaeal histones . Specifically , we identify no hPTMs in N . viennensis and 191 M . spelaei ( one and two histones detected , respectively ) , three acetylations and one methylation in 192 M . stamsii ( in three out of four histones detected ) , and one acetylation and two methylations in M . 193 cuticularis ( in two out of four histones ; Fig . 2b , top ) . Interestingly , we find conserved lysine resi - 194 dues with shared modifications in M . stamsii and M . cuticularis ( methylation in K54 and acetyla - 195 tion in K57 ; Fig . 2b , bottom ) . This result indicates that highly - abundant hPTMs represent a eukary - 196 otic innovation , likely linked to dynamic nucleosomal regulation in eukaryotes but not in Archaea . 197 198 Taxonomic distribution of chromatin - associated proteins 199 6 hPTMs are deposited and removed by specific modifying enzymes ( ‘writers’ and ‘erasers’ ) , while 200 ‘reader’ protein domains found in diverse proteins bind and recognize specific hPTMs . For exam - 201 ple , Bromo and Chromo domains bind acetylated and methylated lysine residues , respectively . In 202 addition , the control of histone loading / eviction from specific genomic loci is mediated by chroma - 203 tin remodellers , like SNF2 proteins 27 , and histone chaperones 26 . To date , the classification and evo - 204 lutionary analysis of this chromatin machinery has been based on biased , partial taxonomic sam - 205 plings and has not employed phylogenetic methods 61 ( with rare exceptions 12 , 27 ) , often resulting in 206 inaccurate orthologous relationships and confounded classification and naming schemes . 207 We sought to obtain a systematic , phylogenetics - based classification of histone remodellers , chap - 208 erones , readers , and modifiers in order to understand the evolutionary history of eukaryotic chroma - 209 tin ( Fig . 3a ) . To this end , we ( i ) compiled a taxa - rich dataset of 172 eukaryotic genomes and 210 transcriptomes , covering all major eukaryotic supergroups and devoting particular attention to ear - 211 ly - branching , non - parasitic lineages ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , as well as genomic data from 4 , 226 212 Archaea , 24 , 886 Bacteria and 185 , 579 viral taxa ; ( ii ) defined a protein structural domain as a proxy 213 for each gene family ( Supplementary Table 4 ) and retrieved all genes in these genomes that con - 214 tained these domains ; and ( iii ) inferred accurate orthology groups from phylogenetic analyses of 215 each gene class ( next section ) . 216 We examined the taxonomic distribution and abundance of the major gene classes ( Fig . 3b , c ) . Many 217 domains with chromatin - associated functions in eukaryotes are also present in Archaea and Bacte - 218 ria , albeit with scattered phylogenetic distributions ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) . Fami - 219 lies with prokaryotic homologs include mostly catalytic gene classes ( writer , eraser and remodeller 220 enzymes ) , whereas readers and histone chaperones are virtually absent from prokaryotes ( Fig . 3b ) . 221 Histone fold - encoding genes constitute a case in point for this patchy distribution of chromatin pro - 222 teins in prokaryotes : they are present in most archaeal phyla , but are absent in about half of the 223 sampled genomes within each ( Fig . 3b ) . Yet , there is a qualitative difference between the phyloge - 224 netic distribution of archaeal and bacterial chromatin - associated gene classes : whereas archaeal 225 histones tend to co - occur with chromatin - associated gene classes , the bacterial complement of writ - 226 ers and erasers is much less conserved and is uncorrelated with the extremely rare presence of his - 227 tone - like genes ( Fig . 3d ) . 228 Within eukaryotes , most gene structural classes associated with chromatin functions are ubiquitous - 229 ly distributed across all lineages here surveyed , supporting an early eukaryotic origin for the core 230 chromatin machinery ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . 3d ) . In fact , the total number of chromatin 231 writer , eraser and remodeller enzymes remains remarkably stable across eukaryotes ( Fig . 3e ) . The 232 only exception is the marked increase in genes encoding reader domains observed in lineages exhib - 233 iting complex multicellularity : animals , streptophyte plants , and , to a lesser degree , phaeophyte 234 brown algae ( Stramenopila ) . This occurs partially due to the addition of new gene classes ( e . g . , 235 SAWADEE in the Plantae s . l . + Cryptista lineage , or ADD _ DNMT3 in bilaterians and cnidarians ) , 236 but also via the expansion of ancient , widely - distributed reader gene classes ( e . g . , Tudor , PHD , 237 Chromo or Bromo domains ) . These taxonomic patterns indicate that chromatin modifying and re - 238 modelling catalytic activities originated in prokaryotes , while reader and chaperone structural do - 239 mains are eukaryotic innovations . 240 7 241 Phylogenetics of chromatin modifiers and remodellers 242 To gain detailed insights into the origin and evolution of chromatin gene families , we used phyloge - 243 netic analysis to define orthology groups from paneukaryotic gene trees . We surveyed 172 eukary - 244 otic species and defined a total of 1 , 713 gene families ( orthogroups ) encompassing 51 , 426 genes , 245 95 % of which were conserved in two or more high - ranking taxonomic groups ( as listed in Fig . 1a ) , 246 and which included 51 , 426 genes in total ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . We annotated each gene fami - 247 ly according to known members from eukaryotic model species . For simplicity , we use a human - 248 based naming scheme throughout the present manuscript ( unless otherwise stated ) , but we also pro - 249 vide a dictionary of orthologs in three additional model species ( Arabidopsis thaliana , Saccharomy - 250 ces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster ; see Supplementary Table 5 ) . This phylogenetic clas - 251 sification scheme of eukaryotic chromatin gene families , as well as the sequences and associated 252 phylogenetic trees , can be explored and retrieved in an interactive database : https : / / sebe - 253 lab . shinyapps . io / chromatin _ evolution 254 We first investigated the potential pre - eukaryotic origins of these gene families / orthogroups by 255 comparing their phylogenetic distance to prokaryotic sequences and to other eukaryotic orthogroups 256 ( Fig . 4a ) . Most eukaryotic gene families are more closely related to other eukaryotes than to pro - 257 karyotic sequences , supporting the idea that writers , erasers , remodellers and readers diversified 258 within the eukaryotic lineage , as previously noted for histones 12 . This analysis also reveals a sub - 259 stantial fraction of eukaryotic gene families with close orthogroups in Archaea and Bacteria , which 260 pinpoints components that were ( i ) inherited from a prokaryotic ancestor during eukaryogenesis ; ( ii ) 261 laterally transferred between eukaryotes and prokaryotes at later stages ; or ( iii ) a combination of 262 both phenomena . For example , we identified a well - supported sister - group relationship between the 263 eukaryotic SIRT7 deacetylase and a clade of Asgard archaea Sirtuin enzymes ( Heimdallarchaeota 264 and Lokiarchaeota ) , a topology compatible with an archaeal origin or ancient transfers to / from 265 Asgard and eukaryotes 62 ; whereas SIRT6 appears nested within other eukaryotic sequences ( Fig . 266 4b , left ) . Likewise , the KAT14 acetylase is more closely related to bacterial enzymes than to other 267 eukaryotic acetylases ( Fig . 4b , right ) . 268 Next , we mapped the phylogenetic distribution of orthogroups in order to infer the origin and diver - 269 sification of individual chromatin gene families ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . Using prob - 270 abilistic inference of ancestral gene content , we reconstruct a rich Last Eukaryotic Common Ances - 271 tor ( LECA ) complement of chromatin - associated gene families : 65 acetylases ( amongst which 61 272 were conserved in at least two of the most deeply sampled eukaryotic early - branching lineages , 273 namely Amorphea , Diaphoretickes , and Discoba ) ; 20 deacetylases ( 19 in these early - branching eu - 274 karyotic lineages ) ; 59 methyltransferases ( 55 ) ; 42 demethylases ( 38 ) ; 33 remodellers ( 33 ) ; and 25 275 chaperones ( 18 ) ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Table 5 ) . The subsequent evolution of these families 276 is characterized by relative stasis , with few new orthologous families emerging in later - branching 277 eukaryotic lineages . Notable exceptions include the origin of KAT5 deacetylases and KMT5B / C 278 SET methyltransferases in Opisthokonta ; KAT8 and SIRT7 in Holozoa ; and Viridiplantae - specific 279 deacetylases ( homologs of A . thaliana HDA7 and HDA14 deacetylases ) and SETs ( A . thaliana 280 PTAC14 ) ; among others . 281 8 In spite of their broad distributions across eukaryotes , many chromatin modifier families exhibit 282 variation in their protein domain architectures , likely conferring them functional properties such as 283 distinct binding preferences ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . For example , most CREBBP / EP300 284 acetylases consist of a catalytic HAT _ KAT11 domain and two TAZ and ZZ zinc finger domains , but 285 different lineages have acquired different reader domains : an acetylation - reading Bromo domain in 286 holozoans and stramenopiles , PHD in plants and some stramenopiles , and no known reader domains 287 in other lineages ( e . g . , in the fungal orthologs of the S . cerevisiae protein RTT109 ) . A similar pat - 288 tern is apparent in SET methyltransferase families sharing a core catalytic domain ( SET ) harboring 289 variable DNA - and chromatin - interacting domains – animal SETDB1 / 2 homologs have MBD do - 290 mains that bind CpG methylated DNA , while plants have SAD _ SAR domains with the same func - 291 tion ; and holozoan ASH1L homologs encode Bromo and BAH readers , whereas phaeophytes en - 292 code PHD domains ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Other architectures , however , are much more con - 293 served , as exemplified by the presence of Tudor - knot and MYST zinc finger domains in most KAT5 294 deacetylases ; or the ubiquitous co - occurrence of Helicase - C and SNF2 _ N domains in most 295 remodellers ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . 296 Specific examples of evolutionarily conserved chromatin gene families include the catalytic core 297 and the subunits of well - studied chromatin complexes 63 like PRC1 ( RING1 / AB , PCGF ) , PRC2 298 ( EZH1 / 2 , SUZ12 , EED , RBBP4 / 7 ) and Trithorax / MLL ( MLL1 / 2 / 3 / 4 , WRD5 , ASH2L , RBBP5 , 299 DPY - 30 ; Fig . 4d , e ) . However , when we compared the distribution of these complexes with the 300 hPTMs they are related to , we found a generally poor co - occurrence ( Fig . 4f - h ) . For example , or - 301 ganisms like Dictyostelium discoideum and Creolimax fragrantissima lack EZH1 / 2 orthologs , but 302 we detected H3K27me3 in these species ; while Thecamonas trahens and Naegleria gruberi lack 303 Dot1 orthologs but have H3K79me marks . A poor correlation is also observed between the occur - 304 rence of H3K9me and that of SUV39H1 orthologs . An exception to this pattern is the ubiquitous 305 distribution of H4K16ac and the acetylase family KAT5 / 8 64 ( Fig . 4h ) . These patterns suggest that 306 the specificity between hPTMs and their writers might not be completely conserved across eukary - 307 otes , with distinct members of the same gene classes ( e . g . , methyltransferases ) performing similar 308 roles . In this context , reading domains present in writing / erasing enzymes ( directly in the same pro - 309 tein or as part of multi - protein complexes ) are likely to play a major role in the re - purposing of 310 chromatin catalytic activities . 311 312 Evolutionary expansion of chromatin readers 313 Multiple protein structural domains have been involved in the recognition of hPTMs , such as 314 Bromo and PHD domains binding to acetylated lysines or Chromo , MBT and Tudor domains bind - 315 ing to methylated lysines 23 , 24 . These are generally small domains and can be found both as stand - 316 alone proteins as well as in combination with other domains , often catalytic activities such as hPTM 317 writers , erasers and remodellers . Thus , they are central in the establishment of functional connec - 318 tions between chromatin states . To understand the contribution of these reading domains to the evo - 319 lutionary diversification of chromatin networks , we studied in detail the phylogeny and protein ar - 320 chitecture of reader domains across eukaryotes . 321 9 We quantified the co - occurrence frequency of reader and catalytic domains , finding ( i ) that most 322 reader domains are present in genes without writer , eraser or remodeller domains ( 87 % , Fig . 5a ) ; 323 and ( ii ) that most cases of reader - catalytic co - occurrence involve PHD , Chromo and Bromo do - 324 mains ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . For example , the conserved architecture of the paneukaryotic 325 CHD3 / 4 / 5 re - modellers includes Chromo readers in most species and PHD domains specifically in 326 animals and plants ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Likewise , PHD domains are often present in the 327 KMT2A / B and KMT2C / D SET methyltransfrase ; and the ASH1L family has recruited Bromo and 328 BAH domains in holozoans , and PHD in multicellular stramenopiles ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . In 329 spite of these redundancies , reader families typically have independent evolutionary histories , as 330 illustrated by the fact that most reader domain - containing genes encode only one such domain 331 ( 92 % , Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . 332 We next performed phylogenetic analyses of individual reader domains and reconstructed the gains 333 and losses of these reader gene families / orthogroups ( Fig . 5a ) . Compared to the relative stasis of 334 catalytic enzyme families , this reader - centric analysis revealed a strikingly different evolutionary 335 pattern of lineage - specific bursts of innovation , particularly amongst PHD , Chromo and Bromo 336 genes , as well as Tudor in animals ( Fig . 5a and Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . PHD , Chromo and 337 Bromo families also appeared as the most abundant in the reconstructed LECA reader domain rep - 338 ertoire , which amounted to 89 gene families ( Fig . 5a , left ) . The distribution of gene family ages in 339 extant species also corroborates that more readers have emerged at evolutionarily more recent nodes 340 of the tree of life than catalytic gene families ( Fig . 5b ) . 341 342 Co - option of the chromatin machinery by transposable elements 343 Further examination of the domain co - occurrence networks of readers revealed that Chromo and 344 PHD domains are often present together with protein domains found in transposable elements ( TEs ; 345 Fig . 5c and Supplementary Table 6 ) , including retrotransposons ( e . g . , retrotranscriptases and 346 integrases ; orange modules in Fig . 5c ) and DNA transposons ( e . g . , DNA binding domains and 347 transposases ; red modules ) . It is known that some TEs show insertion - preferences associated to 348 specific chromatin states 65 , often mediated by direct chromatin tethering mechanisms 66 . For exam - 349 ple , the Chromo domain of the MAGGY gypsy retrotransposon of the fungus Magnaporthe grisea 350 targets H3K9me regions 67 . Reciprocally , some protein domains of TE origin , often DNA - binding 351 domains , have been co - opted into chromatin and transcriptional regulators 68 . Thus , we decided to 352 explore in detail the occurrence of chromatin - associated domain ( readers , but also catalytic do - 353 mains ) linked to TEs in the 172 eukaryotic genomes in our dataset ( Fig . 5d ) . Moreover , we used 354 available RNA - seq datasets in many of these species to validate some of these TE fusions ( Fig . 5d - 355 e ) . A fully validated fusion gene would ( i ) come from a non - discontinuous gene model in the origi - 356 nal assembly , and ( ii ) have evidence of expression , with reads mapping along the entire region be - 357 tween the TE - associated domain and the chromatin - associated domain ( Supplementary Fig . S6 ) . 358 We identified 823 predicted gene models containing both chromatin - and TE - associated domains 359 ( Fig . 5d ) . Whilst these TE fusions were not exclusive of reader domains , most such fusions in - 360 volved PHD and Chromo - encoding genes ; followed by SNF2 _ N remodellers , SET 361 methyltransferases , and others . An homology search against a database of eukaryotic TEs revealed 362 10 that most of these candidate TE fusions could be aligned to known retrotransposons or DNA trans - 363 posons . For example , by way of validation , our analysis identifies the SETMAR human gene , a 364 previously - described fusion between a SET methyltranferase and a Mariner - class DNA transpos - 365 on 69 . Overall , 31 % of the candidate fusion genes were supported by valid gene models according to 366 our stringent criteria ( Fig . 5d ) . Interestingly , we find very few cases of hypothetical fusions be - 367 tween TEs and Bromo domains , which recognize K acetylations and are otherwise highly abundant 368 across eukaryotes , and none of them is validated by RNA - seq data . This could be explained by the 369 detrimental effect of targeting TE insertions to sites of active chromatin demarcated by histone 370 acetylations , such as promoter and enhancer elements . 371 Some of these validated fusions have a broad phylogenetic distribution ( Fig . 5e ) , such as a Gypsy - 372 ERV retrotransposon with a C - terminal Chromo domain ( Unk . Chromo 2 . 1 in Fig . 5e ) that is widely 373 distributed in animals and various microbial eukaryotes , and contains dozens of paralogs in verte - 374 brate Danio rerio or the charophyte Chara braunii , many of which are expressed . Another wide - 375 spread Gypsy - ERV retrotransposon with a Chromo domain is present in multiple expressed and 376 highly similar copies in the fungus Rhizopus delemar ( Fig . 5f , e ) , suggesting a successful coloniza - 377 tion of this genome by this TE . By contrast , other TE fusions are taxonomically restricted to one or 378 few related species , such as the fusion of hAT activator DNA transposons with Chromo CBX and 379 CDY readers in the sponge Ephydatia muelleri ; or multiple instances of fusions with Chromo and 380 PHD readers in cnidarians . A common fusion in cnidarians involves different retrotransposon clas - 381 ses with PHD domains orthologous to the PYGO1 / 2 protein ( Fig . 5e ) , which is known to recognize 382 specifically H3K4me 70 . Globally , this analysis reveals that recruitment of chromatin reading and 383 even modifying domains by TE has occurred in many eukaryotic species , in a way that might facili - 384 tate the evasion from suppressing mechanisms in the host genomes as suggested by the expansion 385 of Chromo - fused TEs in the genomes of Chara braunii ( Viridiplantae ) , Chromera velia ( Alveolata ) 386 and Rhizopus delemar ( Fungi ) . 387 388 Chromatin components in viral genomes 389 In addition to TEs , chromatin is also involved in the suppression of another type of genomic para - 390 sites : viruses . Some chromatin - related genes , including histones , have been found in viral genomes , 391 especially among the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses – also known as giant viruses . Eukary - 392 otic core histones have been even hypothesized to have evolved from giant virus homologs , after 393 the discovery that certain Marseilleviridae genomes encoded deeply - diverging orthologs of the four 394 canonical histones 71 . These viral histones have been recently shown to form nucleosome - like parti - 395 cles that package viral DNA 72 , 73 . 396 We analyzed the distribution and abundance of chromatin - related protein domains among viruses , 397 including data from 1 , 816 giant virus genomes . Based on structural domain searches , we identified 398 2 , 163 viral chromatin - related proteins ( Fig . 5g and Supplementary Table 6 ) . The majority of these 399 proteins are encoded by giant viruses ( 55 % ) , followed by Caudovirales ( 37 % ) . Among these two 400 groups , only giant virus genomes encode histones – specifically , the Iridoviridae , Marseilleviridae , 401 Mimiviridae , Pithoviridae , and Phycodnaviridae families . Concordantly with previous studies 74 , we 402 11 also identify remodellers in all giant virus families ; as well as less abundant components of the 403 chromatin writer / eraser / reader toolkit ( Fig . 5g ) . 404 We then investigated the phylogenetic affinities of these viral chromatin proteins , starting with his - 405 tones ( Fig . 5h ) . Our analysis recovers the phylogenetic affinity of Marseilleviridae histones with 406 specific eukaryotic histone families 71 , and makes this pattern extensive to Mimiviridae , Iridoviridae , 407 and Pithoviridae giant viruses ( Fig . 5h ) , with the caveat of the ambiguous clustering of the H4 - like 408 viral histones with either H4 eukaryotic or archaeal HMfB genes . In all these lineages , we identify 409 genes encoding two histone - fold domains orthologous to H2B + H2A ( inset table in Fig . 5h ) , 410 whereas the H4 + H3 histone doublet genes appears to be exclusive to Marseilleviridae . By contrast , 411 histone homologs in Phycodnaviridae , Pandoraviridae ( also giant viruses ) , and Polydnaviridae 412 ( incertae sedis ) are never found as either doublets or as early - branching homologs of eukaryotic 413 histones , suggesting recent acquisition from eukaryotes . 414 Unlike histones , most of the viral chromatin - associated genes exhibited a mixture of prokaryotic 415 and eukaryotic phylogenetic affinities and often lack affinity to any specific eukaryotic gene family 416 ( Fig . 5i and Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Viral readers , on the other hand , are often embedded within 417 eukaryotic clades in gene trees and are similar to bona fide eukaryotic families , exhibiting topolo - 418 gies consistent with recent , secondary acquisitions . This is the case of BIRC2 / 3 / XIAP readers wide - 419 spread in the Baculoviridae , which encode BIR domains that are often hijacked from their hosts 75 . 420 We also find a number of viral Chromo - encoding genes , which fall in two main taxonomic catego - 421 ries : ( i ) giant virus homologs of the eukaryotic CBX1 / 3 / 5 family ( present in Mimiviridae , 422 Iridoviridae and Phycodnaviridae ) ; and ( ii ) homologs from various Adintoviridae , which are closely 423 related to animal Chromo genes encoding rve integrase domains 76 ( Fig . 5i ) . Finally , we also identify 424 a handful of eukaryotic - like viral genes with deep - branching positions relative to core eukaryotic 425 gene families , as seen in histones ( Fig . 5h ) . This includes Mimiviridae homologs of the eukaryotic 426 methyltransferases SMYD1 - 5 and DOT1 ( Supplementary Fig . 7d , e ) , as well as SNF remodeller 427 families with homologs in distinct giant virus clades ( HLTF / TTF2 in Phycodnaviridae , Mimiviridae 428 and Iridoviridae ) . These results indicate that cases of horizontal transfer from eukaryotes to viruses 429 are common in different chromatin - related gene families , including histones . Therefore , it is likely 430 that basally - branching giant virus histones were similarly acquired from a stem eukaryotic lineage 431 and this would explain the observed histone tree topology with extant eukaryotic species . In any 432 case , most of the eukaryotic chromatin machinery appears to have cellular roots . 433 Discussion 434 Our comparative proteogenomics study reconstructs in detail the origin and evolutionary diversifi - 435 cation of eukaryotic chromatin components , from post - translational modifications to gene family 436 domain architectures . We looked first at the pre - eukaryotic roots of chromatin . Multiple aspects of 437 archaeal chromatin have been studied in recent years , including nucleosomal patterns 31 and the 438 structure of the archaeal nucleosome 30 . A recent taxonomic survey of archaeal nucleoid - associated 439 proteins revealed multiple independent diversifications of DNA - wrapping proteins and a strong 440 association between high levels of chromatinization and growth temperature , overall suggesting a 441 structural , non - regulatory role for archaeal chromatin 77 . Our proteomics data support this notion by 442 showing the scarcity of hPTMs in four species belonging to two different archaeal lineages 443 12 ( Euryarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota ) . An earlier proteomics study reported the complete absence of 444 hPTMs in the euryarchaeote Methanococcus jannaschii 34 . Here we do identify a few instances of 445 modified lysine residues in Euryarchaeota , which is in line with the recently reported acetylations in 446 Thermococcus gammatolerans histones 78 . It remains to be seen if hPTMs are frequently present in 447 Asgard and other unsampled archaeal linages , where other eukaryotic - like features have been 448 found 57 , 79 , 80 . In fact , some of these Asgard , particularly Lokiarchaeota , encode for histones with 449 long , K - rich N - terminal tails but that bear no similarity with eukaryotic histones and are , therefore , 450 most probably the result of convergent evolution . Interestingly , Lokiarchaeota genomes also fre - 451 quently encode histone modifiers such as SET methyltransferases and MOZ _ SAS acetylases . How - 452 ever , overall our results suggest that extensive usage of hPTMs is an eukaryotic innovation ( Fig . 453 6a ) . Similarly , while we find the majority of catalytic domains of hPTM writers , hPTM erasers and 454 chromatin remodellers in Archaea and even Bacteria , these appear only scattered in a small fraction 455 of the examined taxa . In contrast , hPTM reader domains and histone chaperones are eukaryotic in - 456 novations , further supporting the idea that the functional readout of hPTMs and the role for histone 457 variants in defining chromatin states are both exclusive to eukaryotes ( Fig . 6a ) . 458 The origin of eukaryotes represents a major evolutionary transition in the history of life 81 . Thanks to 459 sequencing and comparative analysis of archaeal and eukaryotic genomes , we also have a detailed 460 reconstruction of the massive innovation in gene repertoires that occurred at the origin of eukary - 461 otes . This gene innovation in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor ( LECA ) includes cytoskeletal 462 proteins and associated motors like myosins 82 , 83 and kinesins 84 , vesicle trafficking apparatus 85 , 463 splicing machinery 86 , ubiquitin signalling systems 87 and a large repertoire of sequence - specific tran - 464 scription factors 37 . Combining parsimony analysis and knowledge on gene function in extant line - 465 ages ( mostly vertebrates , yeast and plants ) , our results allow us to reconstruct a complex LECA 466 repertoire of hPTMs and associated writing , eraser and reader gene families ( Fig . 6b , c ) . We infer 23 467 to 29 highly - conserved lysine acetylations in canonical histones ( e . g . , H3K9ac and H3K27ac ) and a 468 repertoire of 65 and 20 histone acetylase and deacetylase families , respectively . With the exception 469 of H4K16ac 64 , most histone acetylations are thought to exert a generic , perhaps additive , effect on 470 the opening of chromatin 22 . As such , acetylation marks like H3K27ac have been found to be en - 471 riched in promoters of active genes in diverse eukaryotes 42 . In contrast , histone methylations often 472 have very specific readouts and they can be linked both to active and repressive chromatin states . 473 We infer between 13 and 25 conserved methylated lysine residues in LECA histones , including 474 marks typically associated to active promoters ( H3K4me1 / me2 / me3 ) , gene bodies ( H3K36me3 , 475 H3K79me1 / 2 , H4K20me1 ) , and repressive chromatin states ( H3K9me2 / me3 , H3K27me3 , 476 H4K20me3 ) 88 , 89 . Finally , we also infer the existence of five histone variants in the LECA ( cenH3 , 477 H3 . 3 , H2A . Z , macroH2A and H2A . X ) , as well 33 chromatin remodellers ( e . g . , EP400 / SWR1 and 478 INO80 , involved in loading and removal of H2A . Z , respectively ) and 25 histone chaperones ( e . g . , 479 ASF1A / B and NPM1 / 2 / 3 ) . This indicates that , in addition to an extensive repertoire of hPTMs , the 480 regulation of nucleosomal histone composition was also an important feature in the LECA . 481 Chromatin evolution after the origin of eukaryotes is characterized by an expansion of lineage - 482 specific histone variants harboring unique hPTMs and a net expansion in the number of reader gene 483 families , as opposed to the relatively static catalytic gene families ( writers , erasers and remodellers ) . 484 This is particularly relevant as it suggests extensive remodelling of chromatin networks during eu - 485 13 karyote evolution , that is , changes in the coupling of particular hPTMs to specific functional chro - 486 matin states . An example of such changing state - definitions comes from looking at the hPTMs as - 487 sociated to TEs in different organisms : H3K9me3 + H4K20me3 in animals , H3K27me3 in some 488 plants 90 , H3K79me2 + H4K20me3 in the brown multicellular algae Ectocarpus siliculosus 43 , and 489 H3K9me3 + H3K27me3 in the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia 91 . In the context of the histone code 490 hypothesis 3 , 20 , 92 – 94 , our findings indicate that , while there is an ancient core of conserved hPTMs 491 across eukaryotes , evidence for a universal code / functional - readout is limited , with perhaps the ex - 492 ception of the highly conserved configuration of ancient hPTMs around active promoters across 493 many eukaryotes 42 . Another interesting observation related to the evolution of chromatin networks 494 is the capture of chromatin reader domains by TEs . We find evidence of this phenomenon in a num - 495 ber of species with a scattered phylogenetic distribution , suggesting that it is a recurrent process and 496 that it often leads to the successful propagation of the TE in the host genome . We hypothesize that 497 this process facilitates the targeting of TEs to specific chromatin states , as it has been described in 498 the case of MBD DNA methylation readers captured by TEs 95 , 96 . 499 In the future , a broader phylogenetic understanding of the genome - wide distribution of hPTMs , as 500 well as the direct interrogation of hPTM binders in different species 97 – 99 , will be crucial to further 501 clarify questions such as the ancestral role of specific hPTM and the co - option of ancient hPTMs 502 into novel functions . 503 504 Acknowledgements 505 We want to thank Alex de Mendoza for critical input on the analysis of transposable element fusions .

All gases were obtained from Air Liquide 855 GmbH , Schwechat , Austria . Nitrososphaera viennensis EN76 was grown in continuous culture in a 856 bioreactor as previously described 100 . 857 Cells were harvested via centrifugation at 21 , 000xg 4°C 1h ( Thermo scientific , Sorvall Lynx 4000 858 centrifuge ) , the supernatant discarded and the resulting pellet resuspended in 1ml of spent medium , 859 followed by another round of centrifugation at 21 , 000xg 4°C for 1h ( Eppendorf , Centrifuge 5424R ) . 860 Pellets were stored at - 70°C . All archaeal histones were extracted as described below . 861 862 Histone acid extraction 863 Starting material was a pellet of 50 - 100M cells ( washed once with cold PBS ) or a flash - frozen tis - 864 sue homogenate in liquid nitrogen using a ceramic mortar grinder . Cells were washed first in 10ml 865 of buffer I ( 10 mM TrisHCl pH 8 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 4M Sucrose ) . After 5min incubation , samples 866 were centrifuged at 8 . 000g for 20min at 4 o C and supernatant was removed . The resulting pellet was 867 resuspended in 1 . 5ml of Buffer II ( 10 mM TrisHCl pH 8 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 25M Sucrose , 1 % Triton 868 X - 100 , 1 % Igepal Ca - 630 ) and incubated 15min on ice . In specific cases , cells at this stage were 869 broken using a 2ml Dounce homogenizer ( with Pestle B ) or with a 20G syringe . Then samples were 870 centrifuged at 15 . 000g for 10min at 4 o C and supernatant was removed . The resulting pellet was then 871 slowly resuspended in 300µL of Buffer III ( 10 mM TrisHCl pH 8 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 7M Sucrose , 1 % 872 Triton X - 100 ) and then resulting resuspended nuclei were layered on top of another 300µL of Buff - 873 er III . Sample was centrifuged at 20 . 000g for 1h at 4 o C and supernatant was removed , resulting in a 874 nuclear pellet ready for acid histone extraction . All buffers were supplemented with spermidine 875 ( 1 : 1000 ) , beta - mercaptoethanol ( 1 : 1000 ) , protease inhibitors ( 1x cOmplete cocktail Roche 876 # 11697498001 , 1mM PMSF , 1 : 2000 Pepstatin ) , phosphatase inhibitors ( 1x phoSTOP cocktail 877 Roche # 4906845001 ) and deacetylase inhibitors ( 10mM Sodium butyrate ) . 878 For samples processed using a high - salt + HCl extraction protocol 101 , 102 , the pellet was resuspended 879 in 500µL of High Salt Extraction Buffer ( 20 mM TrisHCl pH 7 . 4 , CaCl 2 1M and protease , phospha - 880 tase and deacetylase inhibitors , same as above ) . Sample was incubated on ice for 30min and then 881 23 pure HCl has added to a final 0 . 3N concentration ( 12 . 82µL to the initial 500µL ) . Samples were in - 882 cubated for at least 2h on a rotor at 4 o C and then centrifuged at 16 . 000g for 10min at 4 o C to remove 883 cellular / nuclear debris . The resulting supernatant containing solubilized histones was transferred to 884 a clean 1 . 5ml tube and Trichloroacetic Acid ( TCA ) was added drop - wise to 25 % final concentration 885 ( 171µL TCA to an approximate initial 513µL sample ) and left overnight at 4 o C to precipitate his - 886 tones . Samples were then centrifuged at 20 . 000g for 30min at 4 o C and the supernatant removed . The 887 pellet was then washed twice with 500µL of cold acetone and then dried for 20min at room temper - 888 ature . Finally , clean histone pellets were resuspended in 30 - 50µL of ultrapure water . Protein con - 889 centration in the sample was measured using BCA and extraction was examined using an SDS - 890 PAGE protein gel with Coomassie staining . 891 For samples processed using H 2 SO 4102 , the protocol was exactly the same except that 400µL 0 . 4N 892 H 2 SO 4 ( freshly diluted ) was used instead , with a similar incubation time of at least 2h at 4 o C . 893 894 Histone chemical derivatization 895 Histones samples were quantified by the BCA method and 10 µg of each sample were derivatized 896 with propionic anhydride , digested with trypsin and derivatized again with phenylisocyanate as pre - 897 viously described 49 . Briefly , samples were dissolved in 9 µL of H2O and 1 µL of triethyl ammoni - 898 um bicarbonate was added to bring the pH to 8 . 5 . The propionic anhydride was prepared by adding 899 1 µL of propionic anhydride to 99 µL of H2O and 1 µL of propionic anhydride solution was added 900 immediately to the samples with vortexing and incubation for 2 minutes . The reaction was 901 quenched with 1 µL of 80mM hydroxylamine and samples were incubated at room temperature for 902 20 minutes . Tryptic digestion was performed for 3 h with 0 . 1 μ g trypsin ( Promega Sequencing 903 Grade ; Madison , WI ) per sample . A 1 % v / v solution of phenyl isocyanate ( PIC ) in acetonitrile was 904 freshly prepared and 3 μ l added to each sample ( 17 mM final concentration ) and incubated for 60 905 min at 37 °C . Samples were acidified by adding 50 µL of 5 % formic acid , vacuum dried and desalt - 906 ed with C18 ultramicrospin columns ( The Nest Group , Inc , Southborough , MA ) . 907 908 Liquid Chromatography - Tandem Mass Spectrometry Sample Acquisition 909 A 2 - μ g aliquot of the peptide mixture was analyzed using a LTQ - Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spec - 910 trometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , San Jose , CA ) coupled to an EASY - nLC 1000 ( Thermo Fisher 911 Scientific , San Jose , CA ) with both collision induced dissociation ( CID ) and high energy collision 912 dissociation ( HCD ) fragmentation . 913 Peptides were loaded directly onto the analytical column and were separated by reversed - phase 914 chromatography using a 50 - cm column with an inner diameter of 75 μ m , packed with 2 μ m C18 915 particles spectrometer ( Thermo Scientific , San Jose , CA , USA ) with a 90 min chromatographic gra - 916 dient . The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ionization mode using a data dependent ac - 917 quisition method . The “Top Speed” acquisition algorithm determined the number of selected pre - 918 cursor ions for fragmentation . 919 920 Mass - spectrometry Data Analysis 921 24 Acquired data were analyzed using the Proteome Discoverer software suite ( v2 . 0 , Thermo Fisher 922 Scientific ) , and the Mascot search engine ( v2 . 6 , Matrix Science 103 ) was used for peptide identifica - 923 tion using a double - search strategy . First , data were searched against each organism protein data - 924 base plus the most common contaminants considering Propionylation on N - terminal , Propionylation 925 on Lysines and Phenylisocyanate on N - terminal as variable modifications . Then a new database was 926 generated with the proteins identified in the first search , , and a second search was done considering 927 Propionylation on N - terminal , Propionylation on Lysines , Phenylisocyanate on N - terminal , Dime - 928 thyl lysine , trimethyl lysine , propionyl + methyl lysine , acetyl lysine , crotonyl lysine as variable 929 modifications . Precursor ion mass tolerance of 7 ppm at the MS1 level was used , and up to 5 missed 930 cleavages for trypsin were allowed . False discovery rate ( FDR ) in peptide identification was set to a 931 maximum of 5 % . The identified peptides were filtered by mascot ion score higher than 20 and only 932 PTMs with a localization score ptmRS 104 higher than 45 were considered . The raw proteomics data 933 have been deposited to the PRIDE 105 repository with the dataset identifier PXD031991 . 934 935 Analysis of hPTM conservation 936 Identification of canonical and variant histones . We classified histone protein domains from a data - 937 base of eukaryotic , prokaryotic and viral sequences ( see details below ) according to their similarity 938 to known canonical ( H2A , H2B , H3 , H4 ) and variant histones ( e . g . , H2A . Z , macroH2A , cenH3 or 939 H3 . 3 ) , as well as other gene families with histone - like protein folds ( e . g . , the transcription factors 940 DR1 , DRAP1 , NFYB / C , POLE3 / 4 , SOS , TAF , or CHRAC ) . To that end , we used diamond to per - 941 form local alignments of each histone domain against ( i ) a set of curated histone variants obtained 942 from HistoneDB 2 . 0 48 , and ( ii ) annotated each domain according to the best hit in the reference da - 943 tabase , which allowed us to classify histone fold - containing proteins as canonical histones ( H2A , 944 H2B , H3 , H4 ) or their main variants ( H2A . Z , macroH2A and cenH3 ) . This best - hit strategy per - 945 forms well in distinguishing canonical histones from each other , as well as each canonical histone 946 from its main variants ( H3 from cenH3 , and H2A from H2A . Z and macroH2A ; Supplementary 947 Fig . 1a ) . 948 Then , we built a graph of pairwise similarity between histones , with edges weighted by the align - 949 ment bitscore ( discarding edges with bitscore < 20 ) . We created visualisations of each connected 950 component in this graph using the spring layout algorithm implemented in the networkx 2 . 4 Python 951 library ( 100 iterations , weighted by alignment bitscore ) 106 . We selected the four connected compo - 952 nents in the graph that matched the four canonical eukaryotic histones ( H2A , H2B , H3 , H4 ; discard - 953 ing edges with bitscore < 20 ) , retrieved the protein sequences for each of them , aligned them using 954 mafft ( E - INS - i mode , 1 , 000 iterations ) 107 , and built phylogenetic trees with IQ - TREE 2 . 1 . 0 ( - fast 955 mode ) 108 . 956 Identification of hPTM homology . We retrieved the protein sequences of the canonical histones 957 identified in each of the 26 species and we used them for the proteomic analysis of hPTMs , and 958 aligned them using mafft ( G - INS - i mode , up to 10 , 000 refinement iterations ) . For this subset of spe - 959 cies , histone class identity was cross - referenced with the HistoneDB search tool . Then , we manually 960 aligned the peptides mapping onto these proteins to identify the position of each hPTM along a con - 961 sensus alignment . In the case of H3 , H4 , and macroH2A , the majority of alignment positions were 962 conserved across most eukaryotes in our dataset , and we used a consensus numbering scheme . In 963 25 the case of H2A , H2A . Z , and H2B , non - conserved insertions and deletions at the N - terminal tail 964 precluded the use of a paneukaryotic numbering scheme . Instead , we reported hPTM positions 965 based on the human homolog ( if possible ) , or relative to taxonomically restricted conserved posi - 966 tions . In cases where position - wise homology could not be established , we grouped multiple amino - 967 acids into stretches of unclear homology , which we report separately from conserved positions 968 ( question mark symbols in Fig . 1 ) . The complete list of hPTMs and their position - wise coordinates 969 relative to the consensus alignment is available in Supplementary Table 3 . 970 Furthermore , we also reported the presence ( in any position ) of modifications in less - conserved 971 histone variants , as well as the linker histone H1 . 972 In addition to the 19 used in our proteomics survey , we also included previously published hPTM 973 data from the following species ( Supplementary Table 1c ) : the brown alga Ectocarpus 974 siliculosus 43 , the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum 109 , the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila 46 , 110 – 975 112 , the ascomycete Neurospora crassa 113 , Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces 976 pombe 46 , and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana 114 – 116 . When available in public repositories , we re - 977 analysed these datasets using the strategy described above . Finally , we also complemented our own 978 proteomics data using previously published hPTM data from Homo sapiens 46 , 117 – 120 and 979 Capsaspora owczarzaki 42 . 980 Comparative genomics analysis of chromatin - associated proteins 981 Data retrieval . We identified homologs of gene families associated with eukaryotic chromatin , us - 982 ing a database of predicted proteomes from a selection of eukaryotic species from all major super - 983 groups ( n = 172 species ; see Supplementary Table 1 for their taxonomic classification and data 984 sources ) , as well as archaeal and viral peptides available in the NCBI nr peptide collection ( as of 985 25th of April , 2020 ) and bacterial peptides available in RefSeq ( release 99 , 11th May , 2020 ) . The 986 database of viral sequences was complemented with peptides from 501 genomes of 987 nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses 121 . 988 Gene family searches . We defined 61 gene classes associated with eukaryotic chromatin , based on 989 HMM models obtained from the Pfam database ( release 33 . 0 ) 122 . This list included canonical and 990 linker histones ( n = 2 families ) , chromatin - specific lysine acetylases ( n = 5 ) , deacetylases ( n = 2 ) , 991 methyltransferases ( n = 2 ) , demethylases ( n = 2 ) , chromatin readers ( n = 16 ) , remodellers ( n = 1 ) 992 and chaperones ( n = 13 ) , as well as multiple families associated with the Polycomb complexes ( n = 993 18 ) . The complete list of gene families , including the associated HMM models , is available in Sup - 994 plementary Table 4 . 995 For each gene family , we retrieved all homologs from the eukaryotic , archaeal , bacterial and viral 996 databases using the hmmsearch tool from the HMMER 3 . 3 toolkit 123 and the gathering threshold 997 defined in each Pfam HMM model . We recorded the taxonomic profile of each homolog . 998 Orthology identification . We aimed to identify groups of orthologs within each of the 61 chromatin - 999 associated gene families using targeted phylogenetic analyses . We followed the following strategy 1000 for each of the 59 sets of eukaryotic genes . First , we partitioned each set into one or more homology 1001 groups based on pairwise local sequence alignments using diamond 0 . 9 . 36 . 137 ( high sensitivity all - 1002 to - all search ) 124 , followed by clustering of the resulting pairwise alignments graph with MCL 1003 14 . 137 ( - - abc mode ) 125 , using low inflation values ( see Supplementary Table 4 ) to favour inclu - 1004 26 sive groupings . Second , we performed multiple sequence alignments of each homology group with 1005 mafft 7 . 471 107 under the E - INS - i mode ( optimised for multiple conserved regions ) , running up to 1006 10 , 000 refinement iterations . Third , we trimmed the resulting multiple sequence alignments using 1007 clip - kit 0 . 1 ( kpic - gappy mode ) 126 . Fourth , we built phylogenetic trees for each trimmed alignment 1008 using IQ - TREE 2 . 1 . 0 108 , selecting the best - fitting evolutionary model using its ModelTest module 1009 ( according to the Bayesian Information Criterion ) and using 1 , 000 UFBS bootstrap supports 127 . 1010 Each tree was run for up to 10 , 000 iterations until convergence was attained ( at the 0 . 999 correla - 1011 tion coefficient threshold , and for at least 200 iterations ) . 1012 Then , we parsed the species composition of each gene tree in order to identify groups of ortholo - 1013 gous proteins using the POSSVM pipeline 128 . Specifically , we used the species overlap algorithm 129 1014 implemented in the ETE toolkit 3 . 1 . 1 130 , which identifies pairs of orthologous genes in a phyloge - 1015 netic tree by examining the species composition of each subtree , and classifying internal nodes as 1016 paralogy nodes ( if there is overlap in the species composition between each of its two descendant 1017 subtrees ) or orthology nodes ( if there is no overlap ) . Pairs of genes linked by an orthology node are 1018 then recorded as orthology pairs . In our analysis , we used an overlap threshold = 0 ( i . e . any species 1019 composition overlap between the two descendant subtrees is classified as a paralogy event ) . The 1020 resulting list of pairwise orthology relationships between genes was clustered into groups of 1021 orthologs ( orthogroups ) using MCL . We further annotated each orthogroup with a string denoting 1022 the gene symbols of the human proteins therein ( if any ) . 1023 Overall , we classified 51 , 426 proteins from 61 gene classes ( defined by protein structural domains ) , 1024 divided into 242 gene trees and 1 , 713 gene families ( orthogroups ) . The source peptide sequences 1025 and gene trees used for these analyses are available in Supplementary Material 7 and 8 . 1026 Ancestral reconstruction of gene content . We inferred the presence , gain and loss of each 1027 orthogroup along the eukaryotic tree of life , using a phylogenetic birth - and - death model 131 imple - 1028 mented in Count 132 . This tool takes a numeric profile of gene family presence / absence in extant 1029 species ( 172 in our dataset ) and a phylogenetic tree defining their evolutionary relationships , and 1030 infers the probabilities of gain and loss of each family at each ancestral node along the tree . 1031 First we trained the probabilistic model in Count . As a training set , we used a random sample of 1032 1 , 000 PFAM domains annotated in the 172 species of interest ( restricting the sampling to domains 1033 present in at least 5 % of species ) . The final model consists of gain , loss and transfer rates with two 1034 Γ categories each , and a constant duplication rate ( given that we only recorded gene pres - 1035 ence / absence , duplication events are not included in our downstream analyses ) . This model was 1036 obtained in three sequential rounds of training , so as to sequentially add zero , one and two Γ catego - 1037 ries to each evolutionary rate . Each round consisted of up to 100 iterations , and stopped when the 1038 relative change in the model log - likelihood fell by 0 . 1 % in two consecutive rounds . The final evolu - 1039 tionary rates and the Newick - formatted species tree used in this step are available in the Supple - 1040 mentary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 3a . 1041 Second , we calculated the posterior probability of gain , loss and presence of each orthogroup in our 1042 dataset with Count . The aggregated counts of gains and losses of the various classes of chromatin - 1043 associated proteins ( acetylases , deacetylases , methyltransferases , demethylases , readers and 1044 remodellers ) along the eukaryotic tree were obtained by summing the probabilities of gain , presence 1045 27 or loss of all orthogroups of a given class at each ancestral node . To investigate the evolutionary 1046 histories of specific orthogroups at a given node in the tree , we applied a probability threshold of 1047 0 . 9 ( for presence ) or 0 . 5 ( to identify the most probable gain and loss node ) . The Count model was 1048 not able to calculate ancestral probabilities for a few orthogroups with widespread phylogenetic 1049 distributions , due to violations of the birth - and - death model ( 25 out of 1 , 713 families ) . In order to 1050 be able to report presence probabilities in the LECA for these orthogroups , we inferred their pres - 1051 ence in this ancestor using the Wagner parsimony procedure implemented in Count with a gain - to - 1052 loss penalty g = 5 , and recorded their presence as binary values ( 0 / 1 ) accordingly . 1053 Protein domain architecture analyses . We annotated the Pfam domains present in each protein from 1054 the gene classes listed in Supplementary Table 4 , using Pfamscan 1 . 6 - 3 and the Pfam 33 . 0 data - 1055 base 122 . We visualized the networks of protein domain co - occurrence from the point of view of the 1056 core domain ( s ) that define each gene class , using the networkx Python library ( version 2 . 4 ) 106 . Spe - 1057 cifically , we built a graph where each node represented ‘accessory’ domains ( i . e . domains that co - 1058 occur with the ‘core’ domain that defines given gene class ) , node size reflected number of co - 1059 occurrences with the ‘core’ domain , and edges reflected co - occurrences between accessory do - 1060 mains . We identified communities of frequently co - occurring accessory domains using the label 1061 propagation algorithm implemented in networkx ( communities submodule ) , which we used as a 1062 basis to manually annotate groups of co - occurring domains of interest ( Fig . 5C ) . Network visualiza - 1063 tions were created using the NEATO spring layout algorithm from the Graphviz 2 . 40 . 1 Python li - 1064 brary 133 . 1065 In parallel , we also recorded the presence of Pfam domains within individual orthogroups , and their 1066 taxonomic distribution . 1067 Prokaryotic roots of the eukaryotic chromatin machinery . We retrieved all eukaryotic domains from 1068 gene class shared with prokaryotes ( Histones , Acetyltransf _ 1 , GNAT _ acetyltr _ 2 , MOZ _ SAS , 1069 Hist _ deacetyl , SIR2 , DOT1 , SET , CupinJmjC , ING , MBT , PWWP and SNF2 _ N ) , collapsing identi - 1070 cal sequences at 100 % similarity with CD - HIT 4 . 8 . 1 134 , and identified their closest homologs 1071 amongst the corresponding archaea and bacteria protein domain sets , using diamond local align - 1072 ments ( high sensitivity search ) . The archaeal and bacterial protein sets were also reduced with CD - 1073 HIT ( at 95 % and 90 % sequence similarity , respectively ) . Each set of sequences was then partitioned 1074 into low - granularity homology clusters using the MCL - based strategy described above ( inflation I = 1075 1 . 2 ) , and a phylogenetic tree was then constructed from each homology cluster with IQ - TREE ( as 1076 described above ) . 1077 Then , we mapped each eukaryotic gene to its orthogroup ( obtained from eukaryotic - only analyses , 1078 see above ) and used the distribution of phylogenetic distances from the prokaryotic + eukaryotic 1079 gene trees to classify them according to their similarity to ( i ) eukaryotic genes in other orthogroups , 1080 ( ii ) archaeal homologs , or ( iii ) bacterial homologs . Specifically , we used a majority - voting proce - 1081 dure in which we recorded the number of sequences of eukaryotic , archaeal or bacterial origin 1082 amongst the ten nearest neighbors of each gene ( measuring intergenic distances as substitutions per 1083 site ) , and assigned the most common taxonomic group as the ‘closest’ homolog of that gene ( mini - 1084 mum 50 % agreement ) . This fraction is termed ‘Phylogenetic affinity score’ and reported in Sup - 1085 28 plementary Table 5 . The pairwise distances were obtained from each gene tree using the 1086 cophenetic distance method in the cophenetic . phylo utility of the ape 5 . 4 R library 135 . 1087 Characterisation of fusions with transposon - associated domains . We retrieved all classified genes 1088 from our eukaryotic dataset that contained transposon - associated Pfam domains ( version 33 . 0 ) , us - 1089 ing a list compiled from 68 , 136 ( complete list in Supplementary Table 4 ) , totaling 823 candidate fu - 1090 sions from 91 species ( listed in Supplementary Table 6 ) . We annotated these genes to their most 1091 similar known TE element by aligning them against the Dfam 3 . 3 database 137 using the tblastn pro - 1092 gram in BLAST 2 . 2 . 31 138 . 1093 We validated each candidate fusion using the following criteria : ( i ) contiguity of the gene model on 1094 the genome assembly , i . e . , recording which genes were interrupted by poly - N stretches ( which 1095 might indicate an incorrect gene model ) ; ( ii ) evidence of expression in at least one sample from a 1096 range of publicly available transcriptomic experiments ( from the NCBI SRA repository ) ; ( iii ) evi - 1097 dence of contiguous expression , i . e . , whether an expressed transcript had mapped reads along the 1098 entire region located between the ‘core’ and ‘TE - associated’ domains ; ( iv ) we also recorded the 1099 number of exons per gene ; and ( v ) located near any other candidate fusion gene in the genome . 1100 The list of SRA experiments used for these validation steps is available in Supplementary Table 1 . 1101 This list includes 64 out of 91 species for which transcriptomics datasets are publicly available , and 1102 covers 768 out of the 822 TE fusion candidates ( 93 % ) . RNA - seq read mapping was performed with 1103 bwa mem 0 . 7 . 17 - r1188 139 using the complete set of spliced transcripts of each species as the refer - 1104 ence database . We used bedtools 2 . 29 . 2 140 to identify poly - N stretches in the genome assembly ( as - 1105 sembly contiguity criterion ) . We identified regions of low coverage along the transcript sequence 1106 ( expression contiguity criterion ) using the bedtools genomecov utility , requiring that the coverage 1107 along both domains involved in each fusion and their intermediate regions be higher or equal to two 1108 reads . 1109 Analysis of viral homologs . We investigated the homology of the viral chromatin - associated genes 1110 ( which included 19 out of 61 families present in our survey ) using joint phylogenetic analyses of 1111 protein domains from virus , prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes . We used the same method described 1112 above to investigate the prokaryotic roots of eukaryotic gene classes : we aligned viral domains 1113 against a database of cellular homologs ( high sensitivity diamond search ) , followed by low - 1114 granularity MCL clustering ( inflation I = 1 . 2 ) and phylogenetic tree building ( IQ - TREE ) . Then , we 1115 used the same majority - voting procedure described above to classify viral homologs according to 1116 their similarity to eukaryotic , archaeal or bacterial gene families based on their distribution of phy - 1117 logenetic distances . For viral genes that were most similar to eukaryotic genes , we used the same 1118 procedure to map them to their closest eukaryotic orthogroup . 1119 The complete list of viral genes and their phylogenetic annotation is available in Supplementary 1120 Table 6 . Out of 2 , 163 viral genes in our dataset , 2 , 144 could be annotated as similar to a particular 1121 cellular group using this procedure ( 99 . 1 % ) , and the majority of these genes had a high agreement 1122 in the annotations of their nearest neighbors ( 2 , 096 with ≥ 50 % agreement ; 1 , 449 with ≥ 90 % agree - 1123 ment ) . 1124 In the case of viral histones , we built a separate phylogeny with a few modifications in our protocol : 1125 ( i ) we used additional viral genes obtained from 71 as a reference ; ( ii ) we omitted the CD - HIT reduc - 1126 29 tion and MCL partitioning steps , and jointly analyzed the entire set of homologs instead ; and ( iii ) in 1127 the phylogenetic reconstruction step , we used the approximate Bayes posterior probabilities 141 im - 1128 plemented in IQ - TREE . 1129 Identification of archaeal N - terminal histone tails . We retrieved all archaeal histone domains classi - 1130 fied belonging to the HMfB - like connected component in Fig . 1b , and retained those that fulfilled 1131 the following criteria : ( i ) contained a complete CBFD _ NFYB _ HMF domain according to the 1132 hmmscan search ( defined as an alignment starting at least at the 10th position of the HMM model , 1133 and up to the 55th position ; the HMM model contains 65 positions ) ; and ( ii ) the predicted tail ( N - 1134 terminal to the core domain boundaries defined by hmmscan ) was at least 10 residues long . 84 1135 genes passed these filters , including three N - terminal containing histones previously identified by 1136 Henneman et al . 55 . A complete list is available in Supplementary Table 2 . We manually examined 1137 the sequences of archaeal tails and aligned four sets of similar histones with mafft G - INS - i ( Sup - 1138 plementary Fig . 1d ) . Alignments were plotted using the msa 1 . 24 . 0 library in R 142 . 1139 1140 Data and Code Availability 1141 The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium 1142 via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD031991 .
