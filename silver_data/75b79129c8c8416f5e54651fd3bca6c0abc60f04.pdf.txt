Abstract Several countries have undertaken social distancing measures to stop SARS - CoV - 2’ spread . Asymptomatic carriers’ prevalence is unknown and would provide essential information on hidden viral circulation . In our cross - sectional study , 1 . 82 % of 330 asymptomatic confined individuals living in the community carried SARS - CoV - 2 despite no contact with declared cases , raising concerns about unnoticed transmission . 3 Keywords : COVID - 19 , Asymptomatic , Confinement , SARS - CoV - 2 , North America Article Type : Brief report Summary words count : 52 Main text words count : 1010 Highlights . . . . . . . . . . . .  1 . 82 % of asymptomatic individuals may be SARS - CoV - 2 carriers .  SARS - CoV - 2 may spread asymptomatically in a population under social distancing restrictions . As of August 9 th , nearly 20 million individuals contracted COVID - 19 and about 720 , 000 died [ 1 ] . The United States counts for one fourth of these cases . SARS - CoV - 2 transmission occurs principally through respiratory droplets or direct contact [ 2 ] . Viral load peaks before or at the time of symptoms onset , raising the possibility that pre - symptomatic people significantly contribute to viral spread [ 3 , 4 ] . Other individuals remain asymptomatic despite viral detection , suggesting that they may participate in transmission [ 5 - 7 ] . Studies conducted on individuals from the same households have convincingly shown that pre - symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 carriers might transmit to their family members [ 8 - 10 ] . In a long - term care facility , 23 ( 30 . 3 % ) residents carried the virus , including 13 asymptomatic of the 76 that were tested [ 11 ] . An investigation on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan identified 17 . 9 % of SARS - CoV - 2 infected cases as asymptomatic [ 12 ] . All these reports were carried out in a specific context of strong contacts between individuals . 4 Very few studies have assessed the proportion of asymptomatic individuals in the reality of a community that followed social distancing measures . In an isolated city of Italy , screening three thousand individuals lead to the identification of 88 carriers , including 50 - 75 % of asymptomatic individuals [ 13 , 14 ] . Nishiura et al . reported 13 SARS - CoV - 2 positive individuals , including 4 ( 30 . 8 % ) asymptomatic , corresponding to a prevalence of 0 , 7 % out of 564 citizens evacuated from Wuhan [ 15 ] . These investigations depict a wide range of possible rates for asymptomatic carriers and their proportion in a confined environment remains unknown , especially in the North American context . Despite early social distancing measures , Quebec is one of the most impacted nation with 707 confirmed cases per 100 , 0000 individuals and a fatality rate of 667 per million [ 16 ] . Our cross - sectional study was held between April 14 th and 17 th , 2020 in the Mauricie region , Québec , Canada . We aimed to identify the proportion of asymptomatic carriers in a confined community of adults . The term confinement is used herein to reflect social restrictions instructed by Quebec’s government , progressively implemented starting on March 11 th ( Figure 1 ) . On April 17 th , the last day of this study , 723 positive cases were identified for a total of 17 , 521 with a prevalence of 0 . 204 % and an incidence of 0 . 008 % in the Quebec’s Province . The study A total of 2250 employees between 18 and 69 years old from the Université du Québec à Trois - Rivières ( UQTR ) residing in the region were solicited by email on April 13 th 2020 after exactly one month of confinement . Informed consent was obtained from all participants by using an online secured platform . The study was approved by the Ethical 5 committees of the three implicated institutions . Recruited participants were asked to fill out an online questionnaire to evaluate inclusion and exclusion criteria . Individuals presenting COVID - 19 symptoms were excluded ( Supplemental methods ) . A second form was used within 24 hours post - test . The protocol included a recommendation to seek medical attention if any COVID - 19 - related symptoms emerged . A dedicated clinic where nurses collected a single upper respiratory tract specimen ( oropharyngeal and nares swab ) was set up ( supplemental methods ) . Detection of SARS - CoV - 2 was performed the day of collection by direct rRT - PCR using SeeGene Allplex TM 2019 - nCoV Assay , approved by Health Canada [ 17 ] ( Supplemental Methods ) . Out of 2250 potential participants , swabs were collected from 330 individuals , including 210 women ( 63 . 6 % ) and 120 men ( 36 . 4 % ) of 45 . 7 ±11 . 2 of age [ 18 . 6 - 69 . 8 ] ( Supplemental Table 1 ) . We detected six SARS - CoV - 2 - infected individuals ( 1 . 82 % ; ranging from 0 to 4 % ; CI = 87 . 5 % ) at C t values ranging from 36 . 7 to 38 . 6 . For that same period , a mean of 18 . 03 % of tested symptomatic people carried the virus in Quebec’s Province ( Figure 1 ) [ 16 ] . Four of 6 positive - participants had travelled to North and Central America within the past six months and their trip lasted 5 to 16 days . The last return was on March 16 th 2020 . None of the SARS - CoV - 2 - positive cases reported symptom at time of post - test questionnaire . In a non - official statement to the local press , one participant reported experiencing cough and general fatigue a few days later [ 18 ] . None of the SARS - CoV - 2 - positive individuals reported having contact with COVID - 19 patients . Both negative and positive individuals agreed with and respected confinement rules , and left their home only a few times a week ( Table 1 ) . 6 Conclusion Our study identified 1 , 82 % of asymptomatic carriers in a confined community . Their presence could be explained by 3 scenarios . First , they could be in fact pre - symptomatic individuals , as viral load peaks at the time of , or before symptoms onset [ 12 , 19 ] . Our study was not designed to assess this possibility if symptoms developed later than 24 hours post - test . Second , following symptomatic infection , some cases experience prolonged viral nucleic acids detection by rRT - PCR [ 20 ] . Consequently , some individuals could be post - symptomatic cases with residual viral shedding that were not screened at the beginning of the pandemic . The third possibility is true asymptomatic infection . The rate of this kind of infection is unknown . Pre - symptomatic people significantly contribute to viral spread , but we do not know if true asymptomatic and late post - symptomatic participate in transmission at this point . All positive cases had high C t values , which most probably reflects low viral shedding , although data are sparse on correlation between C t values and contagiousness . 1 , 82 % of asymptomatic carriers is high when compared to the 0 , 204 % prevalence . However , there were 18 . 03 % of carriers among the thousands of screened symptomatic individuals in the Province , ten times more than in our asymptomatic cohort . Our sample size is relatively small . At the time we designed our study , supplies in lab materials and staff availability were problematic , we chose a convenience sample size . Rates of asymptomatic carriers could be different in high - density urban area and in population with different socio - economic characteristics . 7 Despite its limitations , this is the first methodically designed study that evaluates the rate of asymptomatic carriers in a confined population . Six SARS - CoV - 2 asymptomatic carriers that agreed with social distancing measures is a significant number and could suggest that prevalence is underestimated . This could represent ~ 100 , 000 asymptomatic carriers at the scale of the adult population of Quebec’s Province at the time of this study . Interestingly , a preliminary analysis of the seroprevalence on 7 , 691 blood donors from Québec reported a similar rate of positivity [ 21 ] . Our results raise concerns about the possibility of viral spread through asymptomatic transmission , specifically in the context of an apprehended resurgence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections following deconfinement . Since public health focuses on symptomatic cases , it is urgent to determine if asymptomatic cases contribute to transmission and to elucidate the dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 in distinct populations .

Timeline of new cases count and socio - sanitary measures implemented by local authorities . Legend : In the province of Quebec , the first case was declared on February 27 th . On March 11 th , travelers were isolated at home for 14 days upon return , gathering of more than 250 people were forbidden . On March 13 th , the health emergency state was declared . On March 14 th , non - essential visits to hospitals and long - term care facilities were prohibited . Between March 15 th and April 5 th , borders , public places , daycares , schools , businesses , non - essential services were closed , social distancing measures were implemented , gatherings of more than 5 individuals and travels between regions were prohibited . This study was conducted between April 14 th ( 612 positive cases on that day for a total of 14 860 , a prevalence of 0 , 173 % and an incidence of 0 , 007 % ) to April 17 th ( 723 positive cases for a total of 17521 ; a prevalence of 0 , 204 % and an incidence of 0 , 008 % ) ( data has been extracted from public health resources [ 22 ] ) . 9 Graphical abstract .
