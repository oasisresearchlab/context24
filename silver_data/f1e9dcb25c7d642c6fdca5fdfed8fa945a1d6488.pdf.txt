Carbachol - Mediated Endocytosis of NHE3 Involves a Clathrin - Independent Mechanism Requiring Lipid Rafts and Cdc42 Nicholas C . Zachos , Bharath Alamelumangpuram , Luke J . Lee , Peng Wang , and Olga Kovbasnjuk Department of Medicine / Gastroenterology and Hepatology , Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore , MD , USA Abstract Background— In intestinal epithelial cells , acute regulation of the brush border Na + / H + exchanger , NHE3 , usually occurs by changes in endocytosis and / or exocytosis . Constitutive NHE3 endocytosis involves clathrin . Carbachol ( CCH ) , which elevates intracellular Ca 2 + ( [ Ca 2 + ] i ) , decreases NHE3 activity and stimulates endocytosis ; however , the mechanism involved in calcium - mediated endocytosis of NHE3 is unclear . A pool of NHE3 resides in lipid rafts , which contributes to basal , but not cAMP - mediated , NHE3 trafficking , suggesting that an alternative mechanism exists for NHE3 endocytosis . Cdc42 was demonstrated to play an integral role in some cases of cholesterol - sensitive , clathrin - independent endocytosis . Therefore , the current study was designed to test the hypotheses that ( 1 ) clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is involved in constitutive , but not CCH - mediated , endocytosis of NHE3 , and ( 2 ) CCH - mediated endocytosis of NHE3 occurs through a lipid raft , activated Cdc42 - dependent pathway that does not involve clathrin . Methods— The role of Cdc42 and lipid rafts on NHE3 activity and endocytosis were investigated in polarized Caco - 2 / BBe cells using pharmacological and shRNA knockdown approaches . Results— Basal NHE3 activity was increased in the presence of CME blockers ( chlorpromazine ; K + depletion ) supporting previous reports that constitutive NHE3 endocytosis is clathrin dependent . In contrast , CCH - inhibition of NHE3 activity was abolished in Caco - 2 / BBe cells treated with M β CD ( to disrupt lipid rafts ) as well as in Cdc42 knockdown cells but was unaffected by CME blockers . Conclusion— CCH - mediated inhibition of NHE3 activity is not dependent on clathrin and involves lipid rafts and requires Cdc42 .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Introduction The BB Na + / H + Exchanger , NHE3 , accounts for most of the electroneutral Na + absorption that occurs during digestion . NHE3 is initially inhibited in digestion and later in digestion is stimulated [ 1 ] . In most diarrheal diseases , there is inhibition of neutral NaCl absorption in the Na + absorptive cell primarily due to NHE3 inhibition . In the intact ileum , carbachol ( CCH ) elevated intracellular calcium ( [ Ca 2 + ] i ) via basolateral membrane ( BLM ) muscarinic receptors ( M3 ) which inhibited NHE3 activity by 40 % and similarly decreased surface expression of NHE3 [ 2 – 5 ] . NHE3 is often regulated by changes in its plasma membrane versus intracellular location as a result of changes in the rates of endocytosis and / or exocytosis [ 6 – 14 ] . Basal NHE3 endocytosis occurs by a clathrin - dependent process which partially involves lipid rafts [ 15 , 16 ] . Previous studies demonstrated that constitutive and cAMP regulated NHE3 endocytosis occurs through a clathrin - dependent process [ 9 , 17 ] . Carbachol elevation of [ Ca 2 + ] i decreases NHE3 activity and stimulates endocytosis as early as one minute ; however , studies examining [ Ca 2 + ] i - mediated endocytosis of NHE3 in polarized intestinal epithelial cells are incomplete [ 14 ] . A pool of BB NHE3 resides in lipid rafts which contributes to basal , but not cAMP - mediated , NHE3 trafficking , suggesting an alternative mechanism exists for NHE3 endocytosis [ 15 , 16 ] . Recently , the Rho GTPase , Cdc42 , has been demonstrated to play an integral role in cholesterol - sensitive , clathrin - independent endocytosis of integral membrane proteins including the folate receptor as well as the Helicobacter pylori VacA cytotoxin [ 18 – 20 ] . Cdc42 is necessary for a clathrin - independent endocytic process termed the CLathrin Independent Carrier ( CLIC ) / GPI - anchored protein - enriched Early Endocytic Compartment ( GEEC ) pathway [ 21 , 22 ] . Previous studies designed to understand the role of elevated [ Ca 2 + ] i on NHE3 trafficking have used non - physiologic agents including calcium ionophores and thapsigargin in fibroblast or non - polarized epithelial cells [ 17 , 23 – 25 ] . This study tested the hypotheses that : ( 1 ) inhibition of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , prevents basal but not CCH - mediated , endocytosis of NHE3 , and ( 2 ) CCH - mediated endocytosis of NHE3 occurs through a lipid raft and activated Cdc42 - dependent pathway that does not involve clathrin . Materials and Methods Reagents Carbachol ( CCH ) , chlorpromazine ( CPZ ) , methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) , and BAPTA - AM were from Sigma . Pirl - 1 ( 8 - cyclohexil - 5 , 6 - dihidro - 4H - pyrazino [ 3 , 2 , 1 - jk ] carbazole ) , which inhibits guanine nucleotide exchange on Cdc42 , was from Chembridge ( San Diego , CA ) [ 26 ] . AlexaFluor 488 conjugated wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) was from Invitrogen . Antibodies Affinity - purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Cdc42 and clathrin heavy chain were from Cell Signaling .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Cell Line Caco - 2 / BBe cells express all four members of the NHERF gene family and small amounts of NHE3 [ 27 ] . Triple HA - tagged rabbit NHE3 was transiently expressed by adenovirus into Caco - 2 / BBe cells for transport and biochemical analysis . Caco - 2 / BBe cells were grown on Anapore filters ( Nunc ) until post - confluent for 12 days in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 25mM NaHCO 3 , 10mM HEPES , 0 . 1mM nonessential amino acids , 50 units / ml penicillin , 50 μg / ml streptomycin , and 10 % fetal bovine serum in a 5 % CO 2 , 95 % air incubator at 37°C . Cells were serum starved overnight and then treated with 6mM EGTA for 2 h at 37°C . Caco - 2 / BBe cells were then exposed to 3HA - NHE3 adenovirus for 6 h at 37°C . Cells were allowed to recover in normal media over the next 40 h before study [ 28 , 29 ] . shRNA knockdown ( KD ) of Cdc42 5 shRNA constructs for Cdc42 from Open Biosystems were obtained through the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine High Throughput Biology Center ( HiT Center ) . shRNA constructs were packaged into lentivirus particles using HEK293A cells . Caco - 2 / BBe cells were infected with shRNA - containing lentiviruses and KD cells were selected using puromycin as a selection marker . Efficiency of KD was determined by Western blot . shRNA constructs that did not exhibit any measure of Cdc42 KD were used as negative controls . Measurement of Na + / H + Exchange Cellular Na + / H + exchange activity in Caco - 2 / BBe cells grown to 14 - days post - confluency on Transwell filters was determined fluorometrically using the intracellular pH - sensitive dye , 2 , 7 - bis ( carboxyethyl ) 5 - 6 - carboxyfluoresceinacetoxy - methy ester ( BCECF - AM , 5μM ; Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) , as described previously [ 30 ] . Caco - 2 / BBe cells were exposed to 50mM NH4Cl during a 45 - min dye loading , as described previously [ 28 , 29 , 31 ] . Cells were perfused initially with TMA + solution alone or with 10μM carbachol for 1 – 10min ( 138mM tetramethylammonium chloride , 5mM KCl , 2mM CaCl 2 , 1mM MgSO 4 , 1mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 25 mM glucose , 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ) , before being switched to Na + solution ( 138mM NaCl instead of TMA + ) for the Na + - dependent pH i recovery . At the end of each experiment , the fluorescence ratio was calibrated to pH i using the high potassium / nigericin method . Na + / H + exchange activity data were calculated as the ratio of Na + - dependent changes in pH i over initial time ( ΔpH / min ) of Na + - dependent pH recovery using at least three coverslips per condition in a single experiment . NHE3 activity was measured in cells treated with either vehicle or CCH ( 10μM ; 5min ) in the presence or absence of CPZ ( 10μM ; 20min ) , methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ; 10mM ; 20min ) , or Pirl - 1 ( 20μM ; 20min ) . NHE3 activity was measured in the presence of 50μM HOE - 694 ( concentration sufficient to inhibit all other NHE isoforms ) . Initial rates were analyzed by using Origin ( Microcal Software ) to determine statistical significance among individual experiments . Means ± S . E . were determined from at least three separate experiments . Zachos et al . Page 3 Cell Physiol Biochem . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 March 28 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Immunofluorescence Polarized Caco - 2 / BBe cells grown on Anapore filters were imaged under 4 % paraformaldahyde fixed conditions . NHE3 and clathrin colocalization was determined using standard confocal microscopy ( Zeiss 510 META ) . NHE3 surface expression was observed using monoclonal anti - HA antibody conjugated to AlexaFluor 594 ( 1 : 100 dilution ) . The amount of surface NHE3 was compared against FITC - labeled wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) labeled Caco - 2 / BBe cell brush border ( labeled at 4°C ) . Co - immunoprecipitation Co - immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described [ 29 ] . Briefly , Caco - 2 / BBe cells were grown on 10 - cm 2 Transwell Petri dishes until 12 days post - confluence . On day 12 , cells were transduced with the adenovirus 3HA - NHE3 construct as described above . On day 14 , cells were serum - starved for 4 h and treated either with vehicle or 10 μm CCH for 5 min at 37 °C . Cells were washed three times in ice - cold PBS containing 50 mM Tris , scraped and lysed in 500 μl of ice - cold lysis buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , 50 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM benzamidine , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ) . Cell lysates were incubated with either anti - CHC or anti - caveolin - 1 antibodies conjugated to Protein G - agarose beads ( Sigma ) for 2 h with end - over - end rotation at 4 °C . Samples were washed five times with lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from beads with 2X sample buffer . Samples were resolved by 10 % SDS - PAGE and proteins were detected with anti - HA ( for NHE3 ) , anti - CHC and anti - caveolin antibodies and visualized on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System ( Li - Cor , Lincoln , NE ) . Results were obtained from three individual experiments . NHE3 surface biotinylation NHE3 surface biotinylation was performed as previously described [ 31 ] . Briefly , Caco - 2 / BBe cells ( transiently expressing 3HA - tagged NHE3 adenovirus construct ) monolayers were grown on Transwell filters ( Corning ) . Cells treated with vehicle or CCH in the presence or absence of M β CD , CPZ or Pirl - 1 were rinsed with ice - cold PBS and then incubated for 30min with gentle shaking in borate buffer ( pH 8 . 0 ) with 1 . 25mg / ml NHS - SS - biotin ( Pierce ) . After rinsing with PBS , cells were washed twice for 10 min with 100μM glycine to scavenge unreacted biotin and scraped into lysis buffer with protease inhibitors . Lysates were incubated with avidin - agarose beads ( Pierce ) to precipitate the biotinylated proteins . The beads were then washed and biotinylated proteins separated by SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for quantitative Western blotting ( Odyssey Infrared Imaging System ) using anti - HA ( for NHE3 ) antibody . Surface biotinylated NHE3 was compared to total NHE3 protein levels . Cdc42 actvation assay Cell lysates were obtained from polarized Caco - 2 / BBe cells grown on Anapore filters for 14 days post - confluency . Caco - 2 / BBe cells were pretreated with vehicle or 35μM BAPTA - AM prior to exposure to 10μM CCH for various time points ( 1 – 60min ) . Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) is a potent activator of Cdc42 and was used as a positive control [ 32 ] . Cdc42 activity ( i . e . bound to GTP ) was measured using Cdc42 Activation Assay Biochem Kit Zachos et al . Page 4 Cell Physiol Biochem . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 March 28 .

Amount of activated Cdc42 was determined by Western blot analysis . Results Clathrin is not required for carbachol - mediated inhibition of NHE3 Activity in Caco - 2 / BBe cells Previous studies have demonstrated that constitutive NHE3 endocytosis occurs by a clathrin - dependent process [ 17 , 23 ] . Caco - 2 / BBe cells were grown on filters until post - confluent for 12 days and were then infected with an adenovirus 3HA - NHE3 construct . NHE3 activity was determined 48 h after the infection . Caco - 2BBe / 3HA - NHE3 cells were pretreated with either vehicle or 10μM CPZ ( blocks clathrin - coated pit formation ) for 30min and then exposed to vehicle or CCH for 5min , prior to Na + - dependent recovery of pH i [ 33 ] . As shown in Figure 1 , in vehicle pretreated controls , NHE3 activity was significantly inhibited ( ~ 47 % ) after CCH treatment ( Fig . 1 ) . In cells pretreated with CPZ , basal NHE3 activity was significantly increased by 29 % compared to untreated controls ( p < 0 . 05 ) while CCH inhibition of NHE3 activity was unaffected by CPZ pretreatment ( ~ 49 % ) . Similar results were obtained in cells exposed to K + - depleted conditions , which also blocks clathrin - mediated endocytosis by removing membrane - associated clathrin lattices ( data not shown ) [ 34 ] . These results suggest that basal NHE3 activity is , at least partially , regulated by clathrin - mediated endocytosis . However , CCH inhibition of NHE3 activity does not involve clathrin . Using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy , NHE3 and clathrin heavy chain did not appear to colocalize after CCH treatment but did exhibit some overlap under basal conditions ( Fig . 2A ) . In order to demonstrate that CCH treatment alters the association of NHE3 and clathrin , we performed co - immunoprecipitation studies . As shown in Figure 2B , clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) immunoprecipitated NHE3 under basal conditions and this association was reduced after 5 min CCH treatment . These results suggest that CCH - inhibition of NHE3 activity does not involve increased association with CHC . Furthermore , the association of NHE3 and CHC was not increased after CCH exposure in cells pretreated with CPZ or M β CD , which suggests that CCH inhibition of NHE3 activity involves a pool of NHE3 that does not associate with CHC . Moreover , we further demonstrated that caveolar - dependent endocytosis is also not involved in CCH regulation of NHE3 activity as immunoprecipiated caveolin - 1 does not associate with NHE3 under basal or CCH treated conditions ( Fig . 2C ) . Taken together , these results suggest that a non - clathrin , non - caveolar dependent pathway of endocytosis is involved in CCH - mediated inhibition of NHE3 activity . Previous studies have demonstrated that clathrin - independent endocytosis involves lipid rafts [ 21 ] . Furthermore , basal NHE3 activity is lipid raft dependent in OK cells [ 16 ] suggesting that an alternate pathway to clathrin - mediated endocytosis may exist for NHE3 trafficking . However , a role for lipid rafts in elevated [ Ca 2 + ] i regulation of NHE3 activity has not been demonstrated . We therefore tested whether constitutive and / or CCH - inhibition of NHE3 activity involves lipid rafts . Lipid rafts are necessary for CCH - inhibition of NHE3 activity We determined the role of lipid rafts in basal and CCH inhibition of NHE3 activity using the cholesterol depleting agent , methyl - β - cylcodextrin ( M β CD ) . In Caco - 2 / BBe cells pretreated Zachos et al . Page 5 Cell Physiol Biochem . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 March 28 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t with M β CD , basal NHE3 activity was stimulated by 30 % ( Fig . 3 ) . This result suggests that a portion of BB NHE3 is associated with lipid rafts and that this fraction participates in constitutive endocytosis since disruption of lipid rafts results in increased NHE3 activity . This result is supported by surface biotinylation studies where BB NHE3 levels are increased by ~ 24 % after CCH exposure in M β CD - treated cells ( data not shown ) . In contrast to pretreatment with CPZ , disruption of lipid rafts by M β CD treatment completely abolished CCH inhibition of NHE3 activity ( Fig . 3 ) . Our current results in Caco - 2 / BBe cells support previous studies which demonstrated that a pool of BB NHE3 resides in lipid rafts in intestinal epithelial cells . Furthermore , we demonstrate that M β CD treatment completely prevented CCH inhibition of NHE3 activity suggesting that the pool of BB NHE3 inhibited by CCH is in lipid rafts ( Fig . 3 ) . Since all clathrin - independent endocytosis has been shown to involve lipid rafts and depend on small GTPases , we next tested whether CCH inhibition of NHE3 activity required the Rho GTPase , Cdc42 [ 35 ] . Cdc42 is necessary for CCH - inhibition of NHE3 activity Previous studies demonstrated that clathrin - independent endocytosis involves members of the Rho family of small GTPases [ 36 ] . Examples of clathrin - independent endocytosis that are dependent on small GTPases include CLIC / GEEC and macropinocytosis [ 21 ] . Since Cdc42 is required for some types of clathrin - independent endocytosis , we tested whether basal or CCH inhibition of NHE3 activity required Cdc42 . In order to demonstrate that CCH signaling activates Cdc42 , we measured the amount of GTP - bound Cdc42 ( i . e . active form ) after CCH treatment . After 5min CCH treatment , the levels of GTP - bound Cdc42 were significantly increased compared to untreated controls ( Fig . 4 ) . In fact , Cdc42 activation occurred as early as 1min post CCH and remained elevated for up to 20min ( data not shown ) . We then pretreated Caco - 2 / BBe cells with the Cdc42 specific inhibitor , Pirl - 1 , and measured its effect on NHE3 activity . As shown in Figure 5 , Pirl - 1 treatment ( 20μM for 30min ) prevented CCH inhibition of NHE3 activity , but did not affect basal activity . We further demonstrated a role for Cdc42 in CCH regulation using shRNA knockdown technology . We tested multiple shRNA probes and generated stable Cdc42 KD Caco - 2 / BBe cells ( Fig . 6 ) . By Western blot , Cdc42 KD ( denoted as Cdc42 shRNA A ) reduced expression by 74 % compared to empty vector and ineffective Cdc42 shRNA constructs ( Cdc42 shRNA B ; Fig . 6 ) . We then tested the effect of Cdc42 KD on NHE3 under basal and CCH treated conditions . As demonstrated in Figure 6 , Cdc42 KD abolished CCH regulation of NHE3 activity but did not alter basal NHE3 activity when compared to Cdc42 shRNA KD B cells . These data support the hypothesis that CCH induced endocytosis of NHE3 requires lipid rafts and Cdc42 . Inhibition of Cdc42 , but not clathrin , prevents CCH - induced endocytosis of NHE3 in Caco - 2 / BBe cells Since it is well established that CCH inhibition of NHE3 occurs by increased endocytosis , we performed immunofluorescence confocal microscopy to determine the localization of NHE3 under basal and CCH conditions . As shown in Figure 7A , NHE3 was localized to the BB of Caco - 2 / BBe cells similar to the localization of the BB marker , WGA , under basal conditions . After CCH treatment ( Fig . 7B ) , the amount of NHE3 in the BB was reduced compared to WGA . Also , intracellular NHE3 vesicles ( arrowheads ) were observed in an Zachos et al .

We further demonstrated whether inhibition of clathrin or Cdc42 prevented CCH induced internalization of NHE3 . In cells pretreated with Pirl - 1 , NHE3 colocalized with WGA in the BB indicating a block in endocytosis after CCH treatment ( Fig . 7C ) . In contrast , NHE3 and WGA colocalization was lost in cells pretreated with chlorpromazine demonstrating that CCH - induced endocytosis of NHE3 occurred even though clathrin - mediated endocytosis was inhibited ( Fig . 7D ) . In order to confirm that changes in BB NHE3 localization under these conditions , we performed surface biotinylation studies . In Caco - 2 / BBe cells treated with CCH , surface NHE3 expression was decreased by ~ 60 % ( Fig . 7E ) . This effect was lost in CCH treated cells pretreated with Pirl - 1 , suggesting that CCH - induced endocytosis of NHE3 involves Cdc42 . Furthermore , CPZ treatment did not prevent CCH - mediated internalization of NHE3 further demonstrating that CME is not involved ( Fig . 7E ) . These results also demonstrate that CCH activation of Cdc42 is necessary for clathrin - independent endocytosis of NHE3 in Caco - 2 / BBe cells . Since CCH signaling involves elevated [ Ca 2 + ] i , we next determined whether activation of Cdc42 by CCH was calcium dependent . CCH - induced activation of Cdc42 is Ca 2 + - dependent In order to demonstrate that CCH activation of Cdc42 depends on elevated [ Ca 2 + ] i , we measured the levels of GTP - bound Cdc42 in Caco - 2 / BBe cells pretreated with the [ Ca 2 + ] i chelator , BAPTA - AM ( 35μM ) prior to CCH treatment . As shown in Figure 8 , CCH treatment ( 5min ) increased the amount of GTP - bound Cdc42 compared to control conditions . Pretreatment with BAPTA - AM prevented CCH - induced increase in GTP - bound Cdc42 suggesting that CCH - induced increase in GTP - bound Cdc42 levels depend on elevation of [ Ca 2 + ] i . Taken together , the results of the current study demonstrate that CCH inhibition of NHE3 activity is due to increased endocytosis by a clathrin - independent mechanism that requires lipid rafts and Cdc42 in Caco - 2 / BBe cells . Discussion This study provides additional insights into the trafficking mechanism involved in regulation of intestinal Na + absorption under elevated [ Ca 2 + ] i conditions . NHE3 is regulated by changes in its plasma membrane versus intracellular location as a result of alterations in the rates of endocytosis and / or exocytosis . NHE3 trafficking occurs under basal and acutely inhibited conditions ( cAMP , cGMP , elevated [ Ca 2 + ] i ) [ 1 ] . Moreover , previous studies have observed that constitutive and cAMP stimulated NHE3 endocytosis occur through a clathrin - dependent mechanism [ 17 ] . However , the mechanisms responsible for NHE3 trafficking in intestinal epithelial cells are not well understood . Recently , studies using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) have characterized nine clathrin - independent endocytosis pathways in addition to clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) [ 21 ] . While previous studies have demonstrated that constitutive NHE3 endocytosis occurs via CME , our data demonstrates a role for clathrin - independent endocytosis in elevated [ Ca 2 + ] i regulation of NHE3 activity . Our concept that NHE3 endocytosis may occur through multiple endocytic pathways is novel and our current study is the first to separate NHE3 endocytosis into clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent pathways .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Recently , Musch et al demonstrated that synaptotagmin 1 regulates cAMP and Ca 2 + mediated inhibition of NHE3 activity in a clathrin - dependent manner [ 17 ] . In their study , the effect of elevated [ Ca 2 + ] i on NHE3 trafficking was determined using thapsigargin , which was used to elevate cytoplasmic Ca 2 + by preventing reuptake of released Ca 2 + into intracellular stores . This study concluded that Ca 2 + stimulated endocytosis of NHE3 occurred in a similar manner to that of cAMP . While this study evaluated the downstream effect of elevated [ Ca 2 + ] i in stimulating NHE3 endocytosis , the study did not determine whether ligand - receptor mediated Ca 2 + signaling regulates NHE3 endocytosis in a similar manner . We have previously demonstrated in the intact small intestine that carbachol ( CCH ) signaling , which elevates apical [ Ca 2 + ] i via basolateral membrane ( BLM ) muscarinic receptors ( M3 ) , inhibited NHE3 activity by stimulating endocytosis [ 2 – 5 , 14 ] . However , elevation of [ Ca 2 + ] i using the calcium ionophore , A23187 , alone was not able to duplicate all of the effects of BLM M3 cholinergic signaling [ 37 ] . These results emphasize the importance of using physiologically relevant agents to study the mechanisms responsible for Ca 2 + inhibition of NHE3 activity in intestinal epithelial cells . The results from the current study are the first to demonstrate that CCH inhibition of NHE3 activity is entirely lipid raft dependent . NHE3 exists in multiple pools in the BB of intestinal and renal epithelial cells ; however , the regulation of NHE3 in these different pools has only been partially described [ 15 , 16 ] . In the current study , we demonstrate that basal NHE3 activity is increased after M β CD treatment in Caco - 2 / BBe cells ( Fig . 3 ) . These results suggest that a pool of NHE3 resides in lipid rafts under basal conditions and participates in constitutive recycling . A role for lipid rafts has been suggested in both intestinal and renal epithelial cells ; although , NHE3 is not believed to undergo stimulated endocytosis in renal proximal tubule cells [ 6 , 38 – 41 ] . In the intestine , CCH stimulates rapid translocation of signaling proteins to detergent resistant membrane fractions that include lipid rafts [ 13 ] . In fact , pretreatment of the rabbit ileum with M β CD prior to CCH , prevented the increase in the size of NHE3 containing multi - protein complexes that result from CCH signaling [ 13 ] . Based on these findings , it is possible that disruption of lipid rafts may prevent organization of signaling complexes that are required for CCH - mediated endocytosis . However , the mechanism by which lipid rafts contribute to inhibition of NHE3 activity remains to be determined . It has been recently demonstrated that clathrin - independent endocytosis requires lipid rafts while clathrin - mediated endocytosis does not . Since several types of clathrin - independent endocytosis pathways have been described , the goal of the current study was to separate the contributions of clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytosis to basal and CCH inhibition of NHE3 activity . Our results show that basal , but not CCH - inhibited , NHE3 activity involves clathrin - mediated endocytosis based on studies using chlorpromazine and K + - depletion to prevent CME . Although all inhibitors of CME have been shown to elicit non - specific effects on trafficking , our results support previous studies that constitutive NHE3 endocytosis is clathrin - dependent [ 17 , 23 ] . Whether additional CME inhibitors affect basal NHE3 trafficking in a similar manner to CPZ and K + - depletion remains to be determined . Our results also demonstrate a modest ( ~ 30 % ) increase in basal NHE3 activity after M β CD treatment suggesting that a portion of BB NHE3 resides in lipid rafts under basal conditions and is inhibitory of basal NHE3 activity in Caco - 2 / BBe cells . These data Zachos et al . Page 8 Cell Physiol Biochem . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 March 28 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t also support previous studies in the intact rabbit ileum and in renal proximal tubule cell lines that demonstrate a role for lipid rafts in regulating basal NHE3 activity [ 15 , 16 ] . However , under elevated [ Ca 2 + ] i conditions , NHE3 regulation is completely lipid raft dependent . These results contrast with previous studies in which calcium ionophores or thapsigargin were used to elevate [ Ca 2 + ] i . In these studies , CME was responsible for NHE3 endocytosis . In this study , we administered CCH to mimic the neurohumoral regulation of normal digestion . CCH binds to basolateral muscarinic ( M3 ) receptors to elicit their physiological effects . Recent studies have linked CCH signaling to stimulation of clathrin - independent endocytosis ; however , more detailed studies of the signaling molecules involved in this pathway are necessary [ 42 ] . Several types of clathrin - independent endocytosis have been described to require small GTPases including Cdc42 , which has been shown to play an integral role in CLIC / GEEC and macropinocytosis [ 21 ] . Our results are the first to demonstrate a role for Cdc42 in NHE3 regulation . Here we show that CCH inhibition of NHE3 activity is also entirely Cdc42 dependent . Furthermore , we demonstrate that activated Cdc42 is required for CCH inhibition of NHE3 activity and that activation of Cdc42 occurs rapidly ( ~ 1min ) after CCH treatment . This rapid signaling is consistent with previous studies demonstrating rapid activation of other CCH signaling events including activated PLC - γ and PKC at the apical membrane in intestinal epithelial cells . Cdc42 is well established to play an integral role in actin remodeling events that are necessary for endocytic vesicle formation and vesicle trafficking . These results in combination with our lipid raft results suggest that CCH - induced endocytosis of NHE3 involves a clathrin - independent pathway . However , identification of the type of clathin - independent pathway involved is not known . Furthermore , more detailed studies about the role of Cdc42 in actin remodeling under CCH treated conditions are necessary to characterize the type of clathrin - independent endocytosis that occurs under these conditions . Why does NHE3 traffic through clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent pathways ? Recent studies have suggested that membrane cargo can internalize through multiple endocytic pathways [ 43 ] . These studies also demonstrated that different endocytic pathways ( i . e . clathrin - dependent versus clathrin - independent ) may lead to separate intracellular destinations including recycling endosomes versus lysosomes / proteosomes [ 44 ] . Other studies have demonstrated that different membrane cargo internalized by either clathrin - dependent or clathrin - independent pathways can merge and share similar intracellular endocytic compartments , including early and recycling endosomes [ 43 ] . It has been shown that CCH treatment results in the increased association of NHE3 with EEA1 - positive endosomes [ 13 ] . A recent report has observed that clathrin - independent endocytosis directs MHC - I trafficking through EEA1 endosomes and eventually leads to delivery to lysosomes for degradation [ 38 ] . Whether NHE3 protein expression is downregulated in response to CCH treatment or whether other NHE3 trafficking involves alternate endosomal compartments remains to be determined . The results of this study demonstrate that CCH inhibition of NHE3 activity requires lipid rafts and activated Cdc42 and suggests that NHE3 inhibition involves a clathrin - independent endocytosis pathway . Whether this pathway is similar to a clathrin - independent pathway Zachos et al . Page 9 Cell Physiol Biochem . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2015 March 28 .

Furthermore , we demonstrate that NHE3 regulation by endocytosis occurs through multiple pathways and suggests a higher order of second messenger regulation than previously recognized . The results of our study may provide insight into how Na + absorption is regulated under the elevated calcium conditions observed under normal digestion and in some acute diarrheal diseases .

Basal association of NHE3 with clathrin is reduced after carbachol treatment . A , NHE3 colocalization with clathrin heavy chain was determined by confocal microscopy in Caco - 2 / BBe cells treated with CCH for 5 minutes . After treatment , cells were fixed and stained with antibodies to label NHE3 and clathrin . Under basal conditions , NHE3 ( green ) and clathrin ( red ) demonstrated partial colocalization in the apical domain of Caco - 2 / BBe cells . After CCH treatment , NHE3 and clathrin did not exhibit any colocalization in any region of Caco - 2 / BBe cells . Scale bar = 5μm . Images are representative of results from three independent experiments . B - C , Association of NHE3 with clathrin and caveolin - 1 was determined by co - immunoprecipitation ( co - IP ) studies in Caco - 2 / BBe cells treated with CCH for 5 min . Immunoprecipitated clathrin associates with NHE3 under basal conditions ; however , this interaction is decreased after 5 min CCH treatment . Similar results were observed after CCH treatment in cells pretreated with CPZ or M β CD . In contrast , NHE3 does not associate with caveolin - 1 under any conditions in Caco - 2 / BBe cells .

Caco - 2 / BBe cells infected with 3HA - NHE3 adenovirus construct were treated with either vehicle ( control ) or 10μM carbachol ( CCH ) for 5min after pretreatment with either Pirl - 1 or CPZ . After vehicle or CCH exposure , cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , permeabilized and stained for NHE3 ( red ; anti - HA antibody ) and wheat germ aglutinnin ( green ; AlexaFluor 488 conjugated WGA ) to mark BB . XY views are shown . A , NHE3 and WGA colocalize in the BB of untreated control cells . B , NHE3 co - localization with WGA and expression in the BB was reduced after CCH treatment . NHE3 appeared in intracellular vesicles below BB ( arrowheads ) .
