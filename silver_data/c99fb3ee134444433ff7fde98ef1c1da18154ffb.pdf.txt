Neurofibromatosis 2 and Neurilemmomatosis Gene Are Identical Mariko Honda , Eiko Arai , * Schunichi Sawada , Arihito Ohta , and Michihito Niimura Department of Dermatology , The Jikei University School of Medicine , and ' Department of Biochemistry , The Cancer Institute , Tokyo , Japan Neurofibromatosis 2 ( NF2 ) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the occurrence of bilateral acoustic neuromas , as well as meningiomas and schwannomas . The gene locus for NF2 resides on chromosome 22q12 and has been cloned recently . Neurilemmomatosis is characterized by multiple cu taneous and spinal neurilemmomas without other signs of NFl or NF2 . Many cases with this disorder include the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis or other rare diseases unexplained by current nosology . In this study , we analyzed the peripheral leukocytes and tissue from cutaneous neurilemmomas of seven pa - T he term neurofibromatosis ( NF ) has been used to describe two clinically and genetically distinct heri table disorders . NFl , whose gene was cloned in 1990 [ 1 - 3 ] , is characterized by tumors of the periph . eral nervous system , cafe au lait spots , and Lisch nodules . The gene locus for NFl resides on chromosome 17 q 11 . 2 [ 4 ] . The NFl gene product ( neurofibromin ) to a large degree shares a common sequence homology with the yeast IRA ! and IRA2 proteins and with the mammalian ras guanosine triphosphatase activator protein , p120 GAP [ 5 - 7 ] . The second type ofneurofibro matosis , NF2 , is characterized by the occurrence of bilateral acoustic neuromas as weIJ as meningiomas , ependymomas , and schwalU1omas . In contrast to NFl , cafe au lait spots and neurofi bromas are rare , and Lisch nodules are absent ; however , posterior subcapsular cataracts occur in half of patients with NF2 . The gene responsible for NF2 has been mapped to chromosome 22q12 [ 8 ] and cloned recently [ 9 , 10 ] . NeuriJemmomatosis , first reported by Niimura in 1973 [ 11 ] , is characterized by multiple peripheral ( cutaneollS neurilemmomas ) and spinal schwannomas , without acoustic tumors or the other signs of N Fl or N F2 . In neurilemmomas , the tumor consists ofSchwann cells . In this study , we analyzed the peripheral leukocytes and tumors from seven patients with neurilemmomatosis using DNA markers for different regions of chromosome 22 . We amplified the NFl and NF2 genes and subjected the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) Manuscript receivcd October ·14 , 1993 ; revised August 1 , 1994 ; acceptcd for pubJjcation Scptember 6 , 1994 .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients and Samplcs Seven cutaneous tumor samples from seven patients were studied . Thc clinical information regarding these patients is given in Table I . Six of the patients were male and one was female . None of the patients had a rnmiJy history . neurologic disorders , or posterior subcapsular cataracts . The tissue samples were obtained at surgery . Histo logic diagnoses were made on hcmatoxylin / eosin - stained , formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded sections of each tumor . The remaining portion of the tumor was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at - BO°C until isolation of the DNA . Thc tumor contained greater than 70 % tumor cells . Normal DNA was obtained from leukocytes isolated with 5 " ! ' , dextran . DNA Extraction Frozen tissue samplcs were ground to a very fine powder in liquid nitrogcn . The powder and leukocytes were digested in 50 mM Tris HCI ( PH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCI , 50 mM ethylenediamine tetraacctic acid ( EDTA ) , 1 % sodium dodecylsulf . 1te , and 1 mg / ml proteinase K at 37°C overnight . The Iysates were extracted with phenol : chloroform : isoamyl alcohol ( 25 : 24 : 1 ) and precipitated with ethanol . The DNA pellet was dried and was resuspendcd in 10 mM Tris HCI ( PH 7 . 5 ) and 1 mM EDTA ( pH 8 . 0 ) . Probes The following DNA markers on chromosome 22 were used : D22S9 , D22S1 , cEW ( Ewing Sarcoma breakpoint ) . L1F ( Icukemia inhibi tory factor ) , D22S15 , D22S32 , and MJ3 ( myoglobin locus ) . The probes for D22S1 and D22S32 were supplied by the Japanese Cancer Research Rcsources Bank . The probe for D22S15 was kindly provided by Dr . Kurnit , and the others were supplied by Dr . Nakamura ( Cancer Institute , Tokyo , Japan ) . Southern Hybridization Five micrograms . of DNA from blood and tumor pairs was digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme , electro phorescd on 1 . 0 % agarose gels , and transferred to nylon membranes ( Pall Biodyne transfer membrane ) , which were hybridized with plasmid DNA probes labeled with [ a - 32 P ] dCTP by random primer extension [ 12 ] . To eliminate the background of repetitive sequences , we added 125 f .

The membrane was hybridized for approximately 12 h at 65°C , washed once in 2 X sodium citratc / sodium chloride buffcr for 15 min at room temperature and twice for 15 min at 65°C in 0 . 1 X sodium citrate / sodium chIoride buffcr and 0 . 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , and thcn cxposed to x - ray film for 12 - 48 h at - 70°C . The membranes were stripped in 004 N NaOH and hybridized repeatcdly . Allele Loss Allclic loss was inferred when the intcnsity of onc aUele in the tumor tissuc was less than 50 % of the othcr allele compared to the intensity of the two alleles in the corresponding normal sample , as measured by densitometry . Loss of heterozygosity was distinguished from chromosome duplication by normalizing the signal for the chromosome - 22 probc to those obtained when the same blots werc rehybridized with probes for loci on other ChrOITIOSOlnes , as a control of chrOlll0S0nuli content . PCR Amplification Oligonucleotide primer pairs of the NFl gene and thc NF2 gene used for the PCR - SSCP analysis havc been dcscribed by Cawthon ci nl [ 2 ] and Rouleau cl nl [ 10 ] ( Table IT ) . DNA samples wcre amplified using PCR ( l min at 94°C . 2 min at 55°C , alld 3 mill at 72°C , 30 times ) . Twcnty - microliter PCR rcactions ( 100 ng of DNA , 1 . 25 mM of each dNTP , 50 mM KCI , 1 . 25 mM MgCI2 . 10 mM Tris pH 804 , 0 . 5 U Taq polymerase , 004 p . l of3000 Ci [ a - J2 PjdCTP / mmol ) with mineral oil were run OJ ] a PCR 9600 machinc ( Perkin Elmer Cetus ) .

Samples werc applied to ; 1 j 0 % ncutral polyacrylamide gel ( 49 : 1 ratio of acrylamidc to methylene - bis - acrylamide ) containing 0 . 1 M Tris - borate , 2 mM EDTA . by the addition of 5 ' X . glycerol to the gel solution .

After electrophoresis . the gels wcre dricd OJ ] vacuum slab drycrs and were cxposcd ovcrnight with Kodak X - Omat AR film . DNA Scqucncing Normal DNA from a paticnt who showed allelic loss in the tumor was amplified by PCR using the same primers . The PCR products were purificd by a Ccntricon 30 column ( Amicon ) and amplified using 3 . 2 pmol of upstream or downstream primcr . Thc product was sequenced dircctly using the dideoxy chain termination method witl , Taq polymerase on thc Applied Biosystems DNA sequenccr ( Applied BioSys tems ) . RESULTS W e detected a loss of heterozygosity for the DNA marker ( D22S15 ) in one of seven tumor samples ( Fig lA ) . The larger allelic restriction fragments ( 3 . 1 kbp ) seen in the BanII digest were lost in a tumor from case 2 . In an additional tumor , an intensity comparison of the bands using a densitometer indicated a hemizygous deletion of the sequences at D22S15 ( Fig lB ) . T he hybridization signals corre sponding to the deleted allele were estimated to be diminished by 50 ' Yo . T hereforc , aUelic losses were shown on the long arms of chromosome 22 at D22S15 in two of seven tumors . Arai cf al [ 13 ] reported one NF2 patient who was discovered to have chromosome translocations t ( 4 ; ·22 ) ( q12 ; q12 . 2 ) . T hey thought that this translocation was disrupting the NF2 gene and thus causing the disease . Fluorescent ill silll hybridization and pulsed - field gel analyses revealed that the breakpoint lay between the LIF locus and the DNA marker D22S1 . T he physical distance from the LIF locus to D22S1 is 2 cM . They obtained approximately 1 megabase of yeast artificial chromosome clones around the LIF locus involving the NF2 t ( 4 ; 22 ) translocation breakpoint region . T he LIF probe detected allelic losses in two of seven tumors , from cases 2 and 7 . Using an e5 probe , on the endpoint of a yeast artificial chromosome clone , the signal from the tumors was reduced dramatically in cases 1 , 2 , and 7 ( Fig lC ) . However , a proximal cosmid clone ( Ewing SaTcoma breakpoints , cEW ) to e5 revealed no significant deletions of DNA in the tumors . Data are summarized in Fig 2 . SSCP analysis of the NFl gene of seven patients showed a normal pattern of SSCP bands . No gross alterations wcre seen in the PCR product ofNF2 gene amplified from genomic DNA ; however , one tumor sample ( case 2 ) did not amplifY using set - 4 . set - 5 , and set - 6 Table II .

DISCUSSION Bilateral acoustic neuromas· ( central neurofibromatosis ) , described in 1822 by Wishart [ 14 ] , were classified as neurofibromatosis 2 ( NF2 ) in 1988 by the N ational Institutes of Health Consensus D evelopment Conference [ 15 ] . NF2 is an autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of about one in 50 , 000 . The number of patients with NF2 is estimated to be about 7000 , and every year 150 new patients are born in Japan . During the last 25 years , 1242 patients with NFl and 48 patients with NF2 were examllled and treated here atJikei University and Tokyo University . The patients with NF2 developed multiple tumors of the nervous system , including nerilemmomas and meningiomas . The studies for loss of heterozygosity in both tumors have suggested that the loci of these genes are located on the long arm of chromosome 22 . In acoustic neuromas , seven of21 tumors ( 33 % ) showed loss of heterozygosity ofloci on human chromosome 22 [ 16 ] .

The radiolabeled PCI \ products were separated by electrophoresis on a 10 ' X , neutral polyacrylatnid ~ gel . DNA from tumor in case 3 did not amplity by PCR using set - 4 primers Complete deletion was detected in the tumor of case 3 ( case 2 in Figs 1 , 2 ) : meningiomas , such as retinoblastoma or Wilms ' tumor , are thought to result from the loss or inactivation of a gene , which is classified as a recessive tumor suppressor gene . R ecently , the NF2 gene has been cloned and sequenced [ 9 , 10 ] . The cDNA encodes a 587 _ amino acid protein with a striking similarity to the proteins moesin , ezrin , and radixm . The proteins named m erlin or schwannomin are thought to be involved in anchoring the cell membrane to the cell ' s cytoskeleton . N eurilemmomatosis is characterized by multiple cutaneous n eu _ rilemmomas and spinal schwannomas , without other signs of NFl or NF2 . Many patients with neurilemmomatosis have multiple cutaneous neurilemmomas associated with schw3l1l10mas of the spinal cord , paraspinal cord , cranial nerves , and viscera , and sometimes meningiomas , gliomas , and astrocytomas . It is said that multiple cutaneous neurilemmomas are a manifestation of a sys _ temic disease .

VOL . 104 , NO . 1 JANUARY 1995 diagnosis is usually made by a denl1atologist when cutaneous neurilemmomas develop . In this study , using probes that span the NF2 gene , we fowld partial monosomy of chromosome 22 in three of seven cutaneous neurilemmomas ( Fig 2 ) . SSCP analysis of the NFl gene of neurilemmomatosis patients showed a nonnal pattenl of SSCP bands . We detected the germ - line mutations in two of three tumors from the same three patients . Mutations in the NF2 gene were deletion from codon 334 to 579 at least , and G insertion at codon 42 . This finding suggests that the neurilemmomatosis locus lies within the NF2 region and that these diseases might be identical . Patients with neurilemmomatosis eventually may develop acoustic neuromas , and tills neurilemmomatosis may be NF2 without acoustic neuromas . The patients with NF2 are prone to multiple neurilemmomas , including cutaneous and extracutaneous tunlors , whereas the patients with NFl may have multiple neurofibromas . Therefore , we would rather use the name neurilemmomatosis instead of NF2 .
