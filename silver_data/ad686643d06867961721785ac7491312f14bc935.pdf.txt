Traction force microscopy ( TFM ) has been instrumental for studying such forces , providing spatial force measurements at sub - cellular resolution . However , the applications of classical TFM are restricted by the typical planar geometry . Here , we develop a particle - based force sensing strategy for studying cellular interactions . We establish a straightforward batch approach for synthesizing uniform , deformable and tuneable hydrogel particles , which can also be easily derivatized . The 3D shape of such particles can be resolved with superresolution ( < 50 nm ) accuracy using conventional confocal microscopy . We introduce a reference - free computational method allowing inference of traction forces with high sensitivity directly from the particle shape .

Traction force microscopy ( TFM ) provides the ability to study such forces in detail 5 , 6 . However , classical TFM is largely limited to in vitro applications 7 , and a range of cellular processes warrant different ( i . e . , non - planar ) geometries , such as cell – cell interactions like phagocytosis or the formation of the immunological synapse , in which mechanical forces have a critical role 8 , 9 . Moreover , with a few notable exceptions 10 – 13 , classical TFM focuses on the study of shear forces , often neglecting forces normal to the surface . Force sensing using spherical sensors is a new area of exploration and ﬁ rst became possible within tissue , and in vivo , by the introduction of oil droplet - based technologies 14 – 16 . Recently , deformable hydrogel microparticles ( MPs ) were also used as force reporters 17 . The use of microgels for MP based traction force microscopy ( MP - TFM ) shows promise for broad applicability because of the mechanical tuneability over orders of magnitude and the potential to measure both normal and shear stresses . Moreover , these elastic microparticles likely more closely mimic cellular mechanical properties than ﬂ uid droplets , making them more appropriate model systems for studying cell – cell interactions . However , current technologies have lacked the resolution to identify contributions from individual subcellular force transmitting structures . Moreover , synthesis of suitable hydrogel MPs for such applications can be rather complex , often requiring specialized expertise in micro ﬂ uidics 17 , 18 . Particle properties , especially their size and mechanical properties , must also be optimized for accurate traction force measurements 18 . Here , we describe a particle - based force sensing strategy spe - ci ﬁ cally designed for studying ligand - dependent cellular interac - tions at high spatial resolution ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . We established a batch production approach for synthesizing cell - sized deformable , and tuneable , hydrogel particles that is simple and reproducible . The resulting particles are homogeneous throughout their volume and from particle to particle . The incorporation of carboxylic acid groups allows easy and ef ﬁ cient derivatisation . Using confocal microscopy , we can reconstruct the particle boundary with superresolution accuracy , allowing us to visualize cell - induced local deformations with < 50 nm precision . Finally , we solve the inverse problem of inferring the displace - ment ﬁ eld and traction forces from the measured particle shape by iteratively minimizing a cost function consisting of contributions from the residual tractions on the traction - free region and the elastic energy , using a fast spherical harmonics - based method 19 . We illustrate the potential of this MP - TFM method by revealing subcellular details of the mechanical inter - action of macrophages with their targets during phagocytosis , as well as the dynamics of force exertion in the T - cell immunological synapse . Results Batch production of deformable hydrogel microparticles . We used membrane emulsi ﬁ cation with Shirasu Porous Glass ( SPG ) membranes with uniform pore size to produce monodisperse spherical hydrogel microparticles 20 , 21 . Acrylamide mixtures containing monomeric acrylamide ( AAm ) , acrylic acid ( AAc ) and the crosslinker N , N ′ - methylenebisacrylamide ( BIS ) were extruded through a hydrophobic SPG membrane under nitrogen pressure , generating droplets in an oil phase ( Fig . 1a ) . After the entire aqueous mixture was dispersed , acrylamide polymerization was initiated within the droplets by addition of the free radical initiator Azobisisobutyronitrile ( AIBN ) . The resulting deformable poly - AAm - co - AAc microparticles ( DAAM - particles ) were collected and resuspended in PBS . As shown previously 22 , 23 , this strategy yields highly monodisperse particles ( Fig . 1b ) . The par - ticle size could be tuned between 4 – 15 μ m ( each with coef ﬁ cient of variation ( CV ) ≲ 0 . 1 ) using SPG membranes with various pore sizes , revealing the expected linear relation between pore and particle size 23 ( Fig . 1c ) . Furthermore , since membrane emulsi ﬁ - cation is a bulk method , we were able to synthesize an estimated 10 10 – 10 11 particles per batch ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . To further tune important particle properties , such as their rigidity , we changed the composition of the acrylamide mixture . In particular , the total mass concentration of acrylic compounds ( C T = C AAm + C AAc + C BIS ) was kept constant , while the cross - linker concentration C c = m BIS / ( m AAm + m AAc + m BIS ) was var - ied between 0 . 3 and 2 . 3 % ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . As expected , C c affects the hydrogel swelling properties , leading to an inverse relation between C c and particle size ( Fig . 1d ) . Particle functionalization is critical for triggering speci ﬁ c cellular behavior and required for visualization of the particles and their deformation in microscopy applications . The incor - poration of acrylic acid in the gel mixture allowed straightforward and ef ﬁ cient covalent coupling of primary amine groups to the DAAM - particles using carbodiimide crosslinking chemistry 24 . DAAM - particles were functionalized with both ﬂ uorescently conjugated bovine serum albumin ( FITC - BSA ) and small ﬂ uorescent molecules ( TRITC - Cadaverine ( Cad ) ) ( Fig . 1e ) . Con - focal imaging revealed highly homogeneous coupling of both protein and reactive dye to the microporous DAAM - particles . The ideal force - reporting microparticle has a homogeneous and isotropic network structure , which underlies equally homo - geneous elastic properties . However , gel swelling or non - uniform polymerization could potentially lead to a radially inhomoge - neous network structure . Derivatization of the particles could also affect particle mechanical properties and lead to further inhomogeneities . Therefore , we evaluated the radial ﬂ uorescent intensity pro ﬁ le ( n > 100 particles ) of both FITC - BSA and TRITC - Cad conjugated to DAAM - particles ( Fig . 1f , Supplemen - tary Figs . 2 and 3 ) . This revealed no radial deviations from a homogeneous solid sphere , even for the softest particles ( C c 0 . 32 % ) , which have swollen signi ﬁ cantly ( ~ 5 - fold ) from the emulsion droplet size . Combined with the homogeneous appearance of individual particles , and osmotic shrinking experiments ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , this strongly suggests that these particles have uniform and isotropic polymer networks . In addition to intraparticle homogeneity , strong interparticle uniformity is critical for the application of microparticles as force sensors . To evaluate particle - to - particle variation , we measured quantitative 3D refractive index ( RI ) maps of individual DAAM - particles ( Fig . 1g ) . These measurements revealed RI values of 1 . 3349 ± 0 . 0001 ( standard deviation ( s . d . ) , n = 8 particles ) to 1 . 3381 ± 0 . 0001 ( s . d . , n = 29 particles ) for particles with C c 0 . 32 % and C c 2 . 3 % , respectively ( Fig . 1g ) . The coef ﬁ cient of variation ( CV : calculated as the standard deviation divided by the relative RI difference between particle and medium ) within each condition were markedly low at 0 . 03 – 0 . 1 . The similarity of the standard deviations between samples suggests that the observed variation may be dominated by the measurement error , and the particle - to - particle variation in polymer network density is potentially even lower . The close match of RI between these particles ( 1 . 3349 – 1 . 3381 ) and the medium ( RI PBS = 1 . 334 ) also represents a signi ﬁ cant bene ﬁ t over glass ( RI GLASS = 1 . 45 ) or polystyrene ( PS , RI PS = 1 . 59 ) beads for many microscopy applications , including their use as target models for immune cell – target interactions . Optical distortions , i . e . , the re ﬂ ection and refraction of light , caused by a particle depends on RI medium – RI MP . For DAAM - particles this value is 0 . 001 – 0 . 005 , whereas for glass or polystyrene these values ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13804 - z 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 20 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13804 - z | www . nature . com / naturecommunications are typically 100 - fold higher ( Fig . 1h ) . We compared confocal images of DAAM and PS particles with volumetric and surface labels ( Fig . 1i ) . Z - slices of both particles revealed apparently equivalent signals . Axial slices of the volume of PS particles , however , showed a distorted shape ( the upper hemisphere appears axially elongated by ~ RI medium / RI MP ) and an inhomoge - neous signal . Furthermore , the ﬂ uorescent signal from the upper hemisphere ’ s surface is re ﬂ ected off the PS - particle surface and is largely not captured on the camera . Such lensing effects are barely noticeable for DAAM - particles . Finally , due to the porous nature of DAAM - particles , the advantageous optical properties are rather independent of the medium , as evidenced from repeating these measurements in Vectashield with RI 1 . 45 ( Fig . 1h , Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . To allow quantitative force sensing with deformable DAAM - particles , we characterized their mechanical properties by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . We used pyramidal tips with a large end radius ( ~ 600 nm ) , which allow imaging of spherical particles , and indentations in the Hertzian regime ( Fig . 1j ) . Imaging of single particles before indentation allows estimation of the particle shape ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) and hence precise localization of the centroid of the particle for subsequent indentations ( Fig . 1j ) . Nano - indentations at the particle ’ s centroids showed typical Hertzian force responses and revealed cell - like rigidities , as quanti ﬁ ed by the Young ’ s moduli ( E y ) between 0 . 3 and 3 . 9 kPa , for C c 0 . 32 – 2 . 3 % ( Fig . 1k ) . For the more rigid particles , we found up to 1 . 5 - fold higher moduli after conjugation of the particles with BSA , which is likely due to 0 x 0 . 32 0 . 65 2 . 34 DAAM - particle Polystyrene particle Volume Surface Volume Surface z - slice Axial slice 0 5 R tip = 0 . 6 μ m MP 1 10 0 . 1 Y oung ’ s m odu l u s ( k P a ) % Crosslinker 0 100 200 Indentation ( nm ) 0 100 200 300 400 F o r c e ( p N ) – BSA + BSA i j k 0 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 Normalized radial distance 0 . 5 1 N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y FITC - BSA TRITC - Cad TRITC - Cad FITC - BSA Simulation R I M P – R I m ed i u m PBS Vectashield RI ∼ 1 . 334 RI ∼ 1 . 45 1 . 334 1 . 335 1 . 336 1 . 337 1 . 338 R e f r a c t i v e i nde x 1 . 339 1 . 334 1 . 338 Refractive index Height ( μ m ) 2 . 3 0 . 65 0 . 32 Silica Polystyrene DAAM e g f h 0 5 10 15 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 P r obab ili t y ∅ particle ( μ m ) ∅ pa r t i c l e ( μ m ) ∅ pore ( μ m ) ∅ pore = 1 . 9 ( μ m ) 0 5 10 15 0 5 10 15 m ≈ 4 . 9 0 . 5 1 . 11 . 9 3 . 0 1 2 3 10 – 2 % C r o ss li n k e r a b Pressureregulator Gauge Gel mixture SPG - membrane Oil phase c d % Crosslinker 10 – 2 10 – 2 10 – 3 10 – 1 % Crosslinker 10 – 2 % Crosslinker Fig . 1 Characterization of batch - produced microparticles with cell - like mechanical properties . a Schematic diagram and photograph of the components for membrane emulsi ﬁ cation - based microparticle synthesis . b ( Top ) Phase image of DAAM - particles obtained with 1 . 9 μ m SPG membranes ( crosslinker concentration C c 2 . 3 % ) .

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13804 - z ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 20 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13804 - z | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 3 increased crosslinking of the hydrogel by BSA binding to multiple carboxyl groups . Strikingly , the Young ’ s moduli are 5 – 10 - fold lower than bulk hydrogels of similar composition ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Such discrepancy may be caused by the differences in polymerization conditions ( e . g . , different initiator and tempera - ture ) or gel swelling , and illustrate the importance of direct mechanical characterization of MPs . Finally , we also measured the bulk modulus of the DAAM - particles , which , together with the Young ’ s modulus measurements , yielded Poisson ’ s ratio estimates around 0 . 43 and revealed that the particles are close to incompressible ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Superresolved shape analysis of DAAM - particles . To determine the accuracy with which the particle shape can be reconstructed and to generate a reference shape measurement of undeformed particles , we imaged adherent particles in Vectashield mounting medium ( RI ~ 1 . 45 ) . The 3D shape of individual particles was reconstructed by processing confocal imaging stacks , encom - passing deconvolution , edge detection , and edge localization steps ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . We varied the laser power to obtain particle images with various signal - to - noise ratios ( SNR ) ( Fig . 2a ) and estimated our localization precision as the local surface roughness R rms observed over a small area ( 1 μ m 2 ) . Due to the non - isotropic resolution in confocal microscopy , the local R rms depended on the position on the particle . Therefore , we separately quanti ﬁ ed the R rms at the equator ( latitude < 15° ) and at the particle apex ( latitude > 75° ) , which are dominated by the reso - lution in xy and z , respectively ( Fig . 2b ) . Even at modest SNR ( ~ 15 ) the localization precision in z ( ~ 200 nm ) and xy ( ~ 40 nm ) exceeded the nominal resolution ( full width at half maximum of the PSF ) in the corresponding direction . The principle enabling us to superresolve the particle boundary is similar to single molecule localization techniques 25 , 26 ( Supplementary Discus - sion ) . With increasing SNR ( > 100 ) , the localization further improved ( z : ~ 40 nm , xy : ~ 20 nm ) , also leading to a 2 . 5 - fold reduction in the resolution anisotropy ( Fig . 2b ) . Aside from edge localization precision , the accuracy with which deformations can be measured ( and forces recovered ) depends on the particle shape in the absence of externally applied forces . Deviations from a perfect spherical shape can , for example , be caused by deformation of the emulsion droplets during gelation . In addition , apparent shape deviations can arise from imaging artefacts like drift during recording of confocal stacks . To measure such deviations , we quanti ﬁ ed 1 ) the global R rms , calculated over the entire upper particle hemisphere and 2 ) the sphericity , de ﬁ ned as the surface area of a sphere with equal volume to the particle divided by the observed particle surface area ( 1 for a perfect sphere ) . Global R rms measurements revealed small ( 50 ± 25 nm , s . d . , n = 7 particles ) overall surface roughness , corresponding to deviations of less than 1 % of the particle radius ( Fig . 2c ) . Sphericity calculations corroborated that DAAM - particles are very spherical ( ψ = 0 . 9988 ± 0 . 0004 , s . d . , n = 7 particles ) . Finally , we decomposed the DAAM - particle shape using spherical harmonics for spectral analysis ( Supplementary Note 1 ) , which revealed that deviations from a perfect sphere have no characteristic length scale ( white noise ) ( Fig . 2d ) . Local target deformations induced during phagocytosis . Cel - lular forces have an important role during target engulfment in phagocytosis . Spatial distributions of phagocytic forces have previously only been measured in the frustrated state on ﬂ at substrates 27 , and our conjugatable and deformable DAAM - particles present an ideal tool for measuring them on particles with more physiological curvature . We exposed J774 murine macrophage - like cells to soft DAAM - particles ( 0 . 3 kPa , C c 0 . 32 % ) that were labeled with TRITC - Cad and functionalized with BSA and anti - BSA immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) . J774s showed strongly ligand - dependent attachment to , and internalization of , antibody - coated DAAM - particles ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Moreover , in agreement with previous ﬁ ndings 8 , 28 , phagocytic engulfment was strongly rigidity - dependent , with uptake of 7 kPa ( C c 2 . 3 % ) DAAM - particles being ~ 6 - fold more ef ﬁ cient than uptake of 1 kPa ( C c 0 . 23 % ) particles ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) .

Because the secondary antibody only binds the exposed DAAM - particle sur - face , it indicates the progression of the phagocytic process ( Fig . 3 , Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Confocal images of DAAM - particles undergoing phagocytosis revealed local cell - induced deformations at all stages of the process . To comprehend the full extent of phagocytic target deforma - tion by macrophage - like J774s , the 3D shape of representative particles in various stages of phagocytic engulfment was reconstructed ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ; Fig . 4 ) . In addition , the ﬂ uorescent intensity of the secondary antibody over the particle surface allowed determination of the contact area between the phagocyte and the DAAM - particle , and the location of the base of the phagocytic cup ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ; Fig . 4 ) . This analysis revealed complex and distinct patterns of deformation , suggesting an intricate series of mechanical interactions throughout phagocytosis . Reference - free estimation of normal and shear stresses . To reveal the cellular forces exerted on phagocytic targets , we cal - culated the traction forces from the observed particle shapes . In classical TFM , the displacement ﬁ eld is measured directly , while in our method , the 3D shape of DAAM - particles is measured at high resolution instead . The surface displacement ﬁ eld is not uniquely determined by the surface shape , since multiple dis - placement ﬁ elds can lead to the same shape . To derive traction forces , we thus solved the inverse problem of inferring the traction forces given the observed particle shapes and the traction - free regions from the ﬂ uorescent immunostaining ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . This is accomplished by an iterative optimization procedure described below ( Fig . 5a ) . We started from nodes on the surface of the measured 3D shape ( Supplementary Note 2 ) . By assuming these mesh nodes being restricted on the measured shape surface , a trial displace - ment ﬁ eld u ( θ , φ ) can be obtained , where the co - latitude and the longitude can be calculated by shifting the mesh nodes on the surface of the measured shape θ ; φ ð Þ i ¼ θ 0 þ Δ θ ; φ 0 þ Δ φ (cid:1) (cid:3) i ( See Methods ) . Starting from u ( θ , φ ) as the displacement boundary condition of the boundary value problem in small - strain linear elasticity regime , we can rapidly obtain the full solution , including the stress ﬁ eld σ ( θ , φ ) everywhere in the particle , the traction force T ( θ , φ ) on the surface , and the elastic energy E el using the spherical harmonics - based method 19 . This trial displacement solution guarantees the mesh nodes match the measured shape perfectly . The residual traction on the traction - free region is quanti ﬁ ed by the function R T ; ∂ Ω t ð Þ ( see Methods ) . A cost function f is then constructed for the trial solution u ( θ , φ ) : f u ð Þ ¼ E el þ α R 2 T ; ∂ Ω t ð Þ þ β E pen T ð Þ ð 1 Þ where α is the weighing parameter for residual traction ; β E pen is an anti - aliasing term , which is included to prevent over - estimation of high - frequency contributions in the force calcula - tions ( Supplementary Note 3 ) . The cost function is iteratively minimized using the conjugate - gradient algorithm . The elastic energy is included in the cost function to penalize unphysical solutions that produce the same shape . The minimization process requires evaluation of the cost function and its gradient for thousands of displacement ﬁ elds u ( θ , φ ) . Therefore , each function and gradient value needs to be evaluated quickly .

This would not be possible using general purpose elasticity solvers such as the ﬁ nite element method ( FEM ) . To validate this computational strategy , we designed test cases based on in silico indentation of an elastic sphere by opposing forces . To accurately mimic experimental data , the test cases included normal and shear tractions , a traction free boundary , and noise comparable to our experimentally measured shapes ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . We ﬁ rst used these computational cases to ﬁ nd the optimal values for the weighing coef ﬁ cients α and β ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) , with which we could accurately recover both the direction and magnitude of the input traction forces . Notably , this held true for normal forces as well as for shear forces ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Only small residual traction was present on the traction - free region , which was also the case for the experimental data ( R T ; ∂ Ω t ð Þ < 7 Pa ) ( Fig . 5 ) . Together , these results indicate accurate determination of traction forces using our computational methodology . High resolution study of phagocytic deformations and forces . The method presented here allows studying cellular forces throughout phagocytosis and resulting target deformation in great detail , revealing contributions of individual subcellular force transmitting structures . Observations in the initial stage of pha - gocytosis ( particle 1 , 9 % engulfed ) provided evidence of the cell compressing its target ( C c 0 . 32 % , E y 0 . 3 kPa ) in discrete spots ( Fig . 4a , Supplementary Movie 1 ) . Computation of the mean curvature H over the particle surface clearly showed that the deformation induced by the cell consists of three distinct spots of ~ 1 μ m in diameter . The compressive stresses causing this defor - mation were ~ 60 Pa ( Fig . 5b ) . Approximately 9 % of the DAAM - particle was covered by the cell and the compressive forces were located centrally in this area ( Fig . 5b ) . Signi ﬁ cantly larger target deformations of up to 1 μ m in the radial direction were observed during the stage of pseudopod extension ( particle 2 , 34 % engulfed ) ( Fig . 4b , Supplementary Movie 2 ) . The majority of compressive deformation by the cell was localized in a ring , which coincided closely with the extension of the pseudopod as estimated from the exposed surface labeling , while the indentation induced within the ring is markedly heterogeneous with clear dents and bumps ( R rms = 120 nm ) ( Fig . 4b , Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . These deformations seem consistent with recently reported podosome - like structures during phagocytosis 30 . The heterogeneity appears to be caused by equally varied exertion of normal stresses from 20 to 100 Pa , totaling in 2 . 5 nN normal force ( Fig . 5b ) . Shear stresses up to 50 Pa were also concentrated in this area , and were seemingly distributed in two separate , balanced rings : an outer ring with outward shear forces ( 0 . 5 nN total ) and an inner ring with shear forces pointing to the cup base ( 0 . 5 nN total ) ( Fig . 5c ) . The ring - like compression was accompanied by a ~ 6 % elongation in the direction normal to the ring . Whether such elongation is a result of orthogonal compression alone , or is , at least partly , caused by tension along the axis of elongation is dif ﬁ cult to assess from deformation analysis alone ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) .

Top to bottom , same four particles are shown as in Fig . 4 . Note that the calculated traction forces , especially the absolute magnitude , may be less accurate for particle 4 than for the other particles , due to the lack of a traction - free region ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . All scale bars are 3 μ m .

The entire engulfed surface exposed greater heterogeneity in curvature than the particle surface not in contact with the cell ( Fig . 4b ) . In particular , two distinct pits were visible close to the base of the phagocytic cup ( indentation depths : ~ 250 and ~ 700 nm ) . Such deformations were caused by localized compres - sive stresses up to 100 Pa , and were not expected since in this phase of phagocytosis the cytoskeletal actin is being cleared from the cup base 31 . Observations in the stage of cup closure ( particle 3 , 84 % engulfed ) indicated compression by the cell in a rather smooth ring , and an approximately 7 % particle elongation normal to the ring ( Fig . 4c , Supplementary Movie 3 ) . Although deformations in the ring were less strong than observed in particle 2 , the underlying normal stresses were mostly higher ( 60 – 100 Pa , 3 . 5 nN total force ) , which can be explained by compression of the target throughout the cell – target contact area ( Fig . 5b ) . The smaller variation in force also resulted in a more homogeneous appearance of the ring ( R rms = 60 nm ) than in particle 2 ( Fig . 4c , Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . Shear forces were signi ﬁ cantly lower in this stage than in particle 2 . Interestingly , the peak of the inward deformation and force was not localized at the cell boundary but trailing ~ 1 μ m behind . Curvature and traction patterns were visible throughout the phagocytic cup , and seemed somewhat concentrated at the phagocytic cup base with 2 notable dents ( ~ 80 Pa , 0 . 2 nN normal force per dent ) . Such pits , which were also visible in particle 2 , resemble the size and shape of podosomes 32 , 33 , and could indicate a role for these mechan - osensitive structures in phagocytosis , consistent with recent reports 30 . Finally , a fully internalized particle ( particle 4 ) , which lacked ﬂ uorescent immunostaining ( Fig . 4d , Supplementary Movie 4 ) , was subjected to some of the strongest indentations ( ~ 1 μ m ) by the cell . These strong normal stresses ( ~ 150 Pa ) were also accompanied by large shear stresses up to 60 Pa ( Fig . 5c ) , although due to the lack of a known stress - free region for this particle , our estimate of the magnitude of the forces may be less accurate for this particle ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . The deforma - tions consisted of multiple ( at least 8 ) dents , ranging between 1 – 2 μ m in diameter . The bright ﬁ eld image ( Fig . 3 ) was used to estimate the location of the cup base , revealing that these compressive deformations arise from the site of phagocytic cup closure . Perhaps this indicates that actin that accumulates during cup closure 34 contributes to the repositioning of the maturing phagosome towards the center of the cell . Force dynamics in the cytotoxic T - cell immunological synapse . Next , we applied MP - TFM to study the dynamics of cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) force exertion at the immunological synapse ( IS ) . Such forces are known to correlate with CTL cytotoxicity 9 . DAAM - particles ( C c 0 . 32 % , E y 0 . 3 kPa ) were functionalized with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) and the cognate antigen of the OT - I T - cell receptor , chicken ovalbumin 257 – 264 peptide presented on murine class I major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) ( H2Kb - OVA ) to trigger cytotoxic response in CTLs . The DAAM - particles elicited antigen - dependent Calcium ( Ca 2 + ) in ﬂ ux ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) , indicative of TCR - dependent T - cell activation . Since actin reorganization is critical for force generation in the IS 35 , CTLs were transduced with LifeAct - eGFP for visualization of actin dynamics . CTLs induced strong deformation of the DAAM - particles , with a pattern clearly distinct from the deformations observed during phagocytosis ( Fig . 6 ) . The circular cell – particle contact area , which was obtained from Lifeact - eGFP imaging was ~ 8 μ m in diameter and deeply indented ( ~ 2 . 5 μ m ) , leading to almost inverted curvature throughout the contact area ( Fig . 6a ) . The contact area contained outward directed shear forces ( up to 100 Pa ) and was surrounded by a narrow , and slightly protruding rim , which was the result of local pulling ( 50 – 100 Pa ) . Although ﬂ attening of T - cell – target synapses has long been observed 36 , the surprising crater - like topology we observe may re ﬂ ect the synapse topology enforced by T cells on soft substrates that do not actively resist T - cell burrowing . Importantly , these live cell experiments allowed us to track the dynamics of the CTL - target interaction , and over the timescale of minutes we observed the large scale indented area becoming deeper ( Fig . 6b ) , and localized indentations ( up to 200 Pa , 0 . 5 nN total force ) forming within the contact area ( Fig . 6c ) . Pulling in the ring was also highly dynamic with discrete spots ( up to 100 Pa , 0 . 2 nN total force ) appearing and vanishing within minutes . Finally , correlation of force exertion with LifeAct - eGFP ﬂ uorescent signal revealed that these temporal changes in pushing and pulling were accompanied by coincident local increases in actin density . Discussion Here we have introduced batch - produced , deformable , and readily derivatizable microparticles as cellular stress sensors , as well as a numerical method to calculate forces exerted on them by cells with high spatial resolution and sensitivity . Aside from force sensing applications , such particles can serve as ideal model tar - gets for studying cellular processes , such as cell – cell interactions . They provide the unique possibility to mimic the size , rigidity , and relevant chemical characteristics of cells . The tunability of the particles ’ Young ’ s moduli between 0 . 3 and 10 kPa covers a sig - ni ﬁ cant part of the range exhibited by various cell types 37 , and can likely be expanded further . In contrast , polystyrene or silica , which are often used as model targets , have Young ’ s moduli of 2 GPa and 70 GPa , respectively . This is 10 5 – 10 7 fold larger than cells and most other biological materials . Moreover , for micro - scopy applications , the small refractive index difference between DAAM - particles and the surrounding medium ensures little optical distortion in imaging of particles themselves , and results in improved visualization of surrounding cellular structures . Recent reports have described deformable hydrogel particles that can be used as force sensors in multicellular aggregates and tissues 17 , 18 . Compared to the single micro ﬂ uidic channel methods chosen previously , our batch particle synthesis method is simpler , and requires little specialized expertise or facilities . In terms of resulting particle properties , our production method leads to good monodispersity ( CV ≲ 0 . 1 ) , approaching that reached with a single micro ﬂ uidic channel ( CV ~ 0 . 05 ) . Importantly , our observed particle - to - particle variation in optical and mechanical properties is markedly low , and ~ 10 fold lower than reported previously ( Supplementary Discussion ) . Furthermore , we show uniform protein conjugation to the acrylic acid incorporated in DAAM - particles . Such ef ﬁ cient conjugation is crucial for robust triggering of speci ﬁ c cellular responses and , by allowing homo - geneous staining , particle edge localization . We have illustrated how our approach can be used for recording subcellular mechanical behavior in cell – target interac - tions in great detail . Critical to achieving the required high spatial resolution and sensitivity is our strategy for measuring micro - particle deformation and calculating forces . Unlike classical TFM , which was recently extended to deformable microparticles ( ~ 25 μ m ) 17 and is based on measuring displacement of tracer particles embedded in hydrogels , our approach is based on measurement of the particle boundary with superresolution ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13804 - z 8 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 20 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13804 - z | www . nature . com / naturecommunications ( ~ 50 nm ) accuracy ( Supplementary Discussion ) . Although com - putationally more challenging , the sampling in this strategy is not limited by the tracer - to - tracer spacing ( > 1 μ m ) and the approach is sensitive because deformation is measured directly at the point of force application . Like most inverse TFM methods 38 , our computational approach is only appropriate for linear elastic materials , and is currently also limited to small strains ( ε ≲ 0 . 1 ) , although it could in principle be extended for large strains . Importantly , our method also provides a reference - free estimate of cellular stresses removing the need to separately measure the undeformed particle 39 . We have focused on immune cell – target interactions and demonstrated detailed quanti ﬁ cation of patterns of cellular force exertion during these processes . Moreover , we have shown that ×10 3 a . u . 0 min 1 . 5 min 3 min 5 6 7 – 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 7 μ m μ m – 1 1 2 3 4 – 100 0 100 Pa 0 50 100 Pa a b c Distance to centroid Mean curvature LifeAct - eGFP fluorescence intensity Normal traction force Shear traction force DAAMPs ( Rh B - Liss ) CTL Actin ( LifeAct - eGFP ) NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13804 - z ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 20 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13804 - z | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 9 the dynamics of such processes can be captured using live cells and time - lapse microscopy , and can be correlated with cellular protein distributions . As also exempli ﬁ ed by the development of an analogous approach for quantifying forces during develop - ment in zebra ﬁ sh embryos by Träber et al . 40 , the method pre - sented here is expected to be broadly applicable in the study of inter - and intracellular forces in vitro and in vivo . Methods Synthesis of deformable acrylamide acrylic acid particles . All reagents were reagent grade and purchased from major chemical suppliers unless otherwise speci ﬁ ed . All acrylamide mixtures contained 150mM NaOH , 0 . 3 % ( v / v ) tetra - methylethylenediamine ( TEMED ) , 150 mM MOPS ( prepared from MOPS sodium salt , pH 7 . 4 ) in addition to the acrylamide ( AAm ) , acrylic acid ( AAc ) and cross - linker N , N ' - methylenebisacrylamide ( BIS ) with a ﬁ nal pH of 7 . 4 . The total mass concentration of acrylic components ( C T = C AAm + C AAc + C BIS ) was 100 mg / mL , and the relative concentration of acrylic acid ( m AAc / ( m AAm + m AAc + m BIS ) ) was 10 % for all mixtures . The crosslinker concentration ( C c = m BIS / ( m AAm + m AAc + m BIS ) ) was varied between 0 . 32 % and 2 . 3 % , as indicated throughout the text and ﬁ gures . Prior to extrusion , the mixture was degassed for 15min and kept under nitrogen until the extrusion process was complete . Tubular hydrophobic Shirasu porous glass ( SPG ) membranes of 20mm length , 10 mm outer diameter and with pore size ( diameter ) 0 . 5 – 3 μ m , ( SPG Technology ) were sonicated under vacuum in HPLC grade n - heptane to remove gas trapped in the membrane . The membrane was mounted on an internal pressure micro kit extruder ( SPG Technology ) and immersed into an oil phase ( ~ 125mL ) consisting of hexanes ( 99 % ACS reagent , mixed isomers ) and 3 % ( v / v ) Span 80 ( Fluka , 85548 ) . 10 mL of gel mixture was extruded through SPG membranes under nitrogen pressure of ~ 7 kPa , 8kPa , 30kPa and 100kPa , for membranes with pore size 3 μ m , 1 . 9 μ m , 1 . 1 μ m and 0 . 5 μ m , respectively . The oil phase was continuously stirred at 300 rpm and kept under nitrogen atmosphere in a 3 - neck water - jacketed ﬂ ask ( Fig . 1a , custom made by Chemglass Life Sciences ) , during extrusion ( and polymerization ) . After com - pletion of extrusion , the emulsion temperature was increased to 60 °C . Once the temperature equilibrated , DAAM - particle polymerization was induced by addition of ~ 225 mg granular 2 , 2 ′ - Azobisisobutyronitrile ( AIBN ) ( 1 . 5 mg / mL ﬁ nal con - centration ) . The polymerization reaction was continued for 3 h at 60 °C and then at 40°C overnight . Polymerized particles were subsequently washed ( 5× in hexanes , 1× in ethanol ) , dried under nitrogen ﬂ ow for ~ 30 min , and resuspended in PBS ( 137NaCl , 2 . 7mM KCl , 8 . 0 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 47 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) . Microparticle functionalization . DAAM - particles were diluted to 5 % ( v / v ) con - centration and washed twice in activation buffer ( 100mM MES , 200mM NaCl , pH 6 . 0 ) . They were then incubated for 15min in activation buffer supplemented with 40mg / mL 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide , 20mg / mL N - hydro - xysuccinimide ( NHS ) and 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Tween 20 . Afterwards they were spun down ( 2min , 16 , 000 g ) and washed 4× by centrifugation in PBS8 ( PBS adjusted to pH 8 . 0 with NaOH ) with 0 . 1 % Tween 20 . Immediately after the ﬁ nal wash the particles were resuspended in PBS8 with BSA ( Sigma , A3059 ) ( or FITC - BSA for the experiment in Fig . 1e and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) ( for concentrations see Supple - mentary Table 1 ) . After 1h the cadaverine - conjugate was added : either Alexa Fluor - 488 Cadaverine for the ﬁ gures illustrating the lensing effect ( Fig . 1i , Sup - plementary Fig . 5 ) or Tetramethylrhodamine Cadaverine for all other experiments ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . After 0 . 5h unreacted NHS groups were blocked with a solution of : 100 mM TRIS and 100 mM ethanolamine ( pH 9 ) . Finally , DAAM - particles were spun down ( 30 s , 8000g ) and washed 4× in PBS . DAAM - particles were further functionalized with anti - BSA rabbit IgG ( MP Biomedicals , 0865111 ) in PBS ( for concentrations see Supplementary Table 1 ) and spun down ( 30 s , 8000 g ) and washed 3× with PBS for phagocytic assays and lensing effect experi - ments . For the lensing effect experiments , DAAM - particles were resuspended in 4 . 5 μ g / mL Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti - rabbit IgG in PBS , again followed by 3 spins and washes ( PBS ) . 10 μ m yellow - green ﬂ uorescent carboxylate modi ﬁ ed poly - styrene beads ( Polysciences ) were functionalized with BSA , anti - BSA rabbit IgG , and Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti - rabbit IgG similarly ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . For T - cell experiments , DAAM - particles were functionalized similarly to above . Approximately 4 . 1× 10 7 particles ( estimated by haemocytometer ) were conjugated with 9 . 0µM streptavidin ( Prozyme , SA10 ) . After 1h of conjugation with protein , 10 µM Lissamine Rhodamine B - ethylenediamine ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , L2424 ) was added . After 0 . 5h blocking and washing was performed as above . On the day before imaging , particles were spun down ( 6000 g , 2min ) and washed twice with PBS , and incubated with biotinylated antigens and adhesion molecules at room temperature for 2h while mixing . The antigen complex used was 0 . 43 μ g / mL puri ﬁ ed biotinylated H2 - K b - OVA ( chicken ovalbumin ( OVA ) residues 257 – 264 presented on murine class I major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) molecule H2 - K b ) , and the adhesion molecule used was 26 . 1 µg / mL puri ﬁ ed biotinylated intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) . This antigen concentration was chosen based on the saturation of CD69 expression after incubation with functionalized DAAM - particles ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . After incubation , the particles were spun down and washed thrice with PBS . Fluorescent conjugation of BSA . Fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated BSA ( FITC - BSA ) was made according to previously published techniques 41 . Brie ﬂ y , 800 µl of 5mg / mL FITC in DMSO was added to 100 mg of BSA in 10 mL of carbonate buffer ( pH 9 . 0 ) . After 0 . 5h of stirring at room temperature the reaction was continued at 4 °C overnight . The following day the labeling reaction was quenched with 1mL of 1M Tris HCL ( pH 8 . 8 ) followed by dialysis against PBS for 2 h at 4°C . The dialysate was concentrated to 1 . 5mL by placing the dialysis bag in solid sucrose , and desalted over a G25 column equilibrated with PBS . Microparticle size measurements . For microparticle size measurements , particles were imaged with a 20× NA 0 . 4 objective using phase - contrast . For the smallest particles , which were extruded through 0 . 5 μ m pore size SPG ﬁ lters , a 40× NA 1 . 3 objective was used . Images were analyzed in ImageJ , by smoothing ( 2× ) , per - forming edge detection , binarizing images by thresholding and ﬁ lling holes . Finally , adjacent particles were separated using the watershed algorithm , and particle radii were estimated from particle areas . Microparticle refractive index measurements . 3D quantitative refractive index ( RI ) maps were measured on a 3D Cell Explorer ( NanoLive ) and analyzed using ImageJ . Z - slices of the 3D tomogram through the center of individual DAAM - particles were selected for analysis . Histograms of the RI in a small region of interest around the DAAM - particle revealed a clear bimodal distribution . RI MP – RI medium was then measured as the distance between the two peaks of the RI histogram . RI medium was measured for PBS ( 1 . 334 ) , or used as speci ﬁ ed by the manufacturer as 1 . 45 for Vectashield mounting medium ( Vectorlabs , H - 1000 ) . Atomic force microscopy measurements . Unfunctionalized DAAM - particles and BSA + Cad - DAAM - particles were attached to poly - L - lysine coated and untreated circular 25 mm glass coverslips , respectively . All coverslips were cleaned for 5min in boiling water with detergent Micro - 90 , rinsed with milliQ water and dried at 200°C . For poly - L - lysine coating , coverslips were then incubated in a 0 . 1 mg / mL poly - L - lysine ( Sigma , P8920 ) solution for 1h , rinsed with water and left to dry at room temperature . 50 μ l of DAAM - particle suspension ( ~ 2 % solids ( v / v ) ) in PBS was added to the coverslips and subsequently washed 3 times with PBS . AFM experiments were performed with large radius ( ~ 600nm ) pyramidal tips ( LRCH - 15 - 750 - R , Nanoscience Instruments ) on a Bruker Bioscope Resolve setup . The spring constant of individual cantilevers ( ~ 0 . 13N / m ) was calibrated by ther - mal tuning . Before indentation , particles were imaged in peak force tapping mode ( peak force setpoint 0 . 5 – 1nN ) . Subsequently , 2 – 5 nanoindentations were per - formed on the center of particles . AFM data was analyzed using custom Matlab software . DAAM - particle shape was determined as described previously for small vesicles 42 . Brie ﬂ y , a spherical arc was ﬁ t to upper part of the DAAM - particle ( exceeding half its height ) to obtain the radius of curvature R MP , which was cor - rected for tip convolution by subtracting the tip radius ( R tip ) . Assuming that adherent particles form spherical caps , the shape was then approximated from R MP and the particle height ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Indentation curves ( or force deformation curves , FDCs ) were ﬁ rst processed by correction for drift in the baseline and subtraction of a ﬁ t to the cantilever response , which was obtained by performing indentations on bare glass surfaces . The resulting DAAM - particle indentation curves were analyzed by ﬁ tting a Hertzian model up to 0 . 5 R tip , with the contact point as a ﬁ tting parameter . For these ﬁ ts , the effective radius R * , where ( 1 / R * = 1 / R tip + 1 / R MP ) , was used . FDCs for the stiffer DAAM - particles ( C c 0 . 65 % Fig . 6 Live cell force exertion and model - target deformation during the T - cell cytotoxic response . a – c Frames from a time - lapse of the mechanical activity in the cytotoxic T - cell ( CTL ) immunoligcal synapse measured with a soft ( C c 0 . 32 % , E y 0 . 3 kPa ) DAAM - particle functionalized with Rhodamine B - Lissamine ( Rh B - Liss ) , ICAM − 1 and OVA 257 – 264 presented on MHC1 .

Due to the low rigidity of the softest DAAM - particles ( C c 0 . 32 % ) a force threshold of 10 pN was used . The Young ’ s moduli ( E y ) obtained from each of the 2 – 5 FDCs for individual particle were averaged to reduce the measurement error per DAAM - particle . For the Young ’ s moduli calculations , DAAM - particles were assumed to be incompressible ( Pois - son ’ s ratio = 0 . 5 ) , which was previously shown to be a good approximation for bulk 43 and microparticle 18 acrylamide gels . Furthermore , the indentation - induced deformation was assumed to only deform the upper part of the DAAM - particles , which is in contact with the AFM tip . The signi ﬁ cant deformation of the particles due to surface adhesion and the resulting large contact radius ( > 4 μ m ) with the surface ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) , renders the indentation - induced deformation of the bottom of the DAAM - particles , which is in contact with the glass surface , negligible compared to the deformation of the upper part . For bulk gel measure - ments , hydrogels , covalently bound to glass substrates , were prepared as described under the section PSF measurements , but with compositions , and buffer condi - tions , identical to the DAAM - particles ( for all three crosslinker concentrations ) . Measurements were performed with spherical tips ( SiO 2 ) with ~ 300nm radius ( NovaScan Technologies ) . Indentation curves were analyzed as described for the DAAM - particles . Bulk modulus measurements . Bulk modulus measurements were performed as described previously 40 , 44 . Brie ﬂ y , dextran solutions with known osmotic pressure 45 were made from FITC - conjugated dextran ( molecular weight : 2 ×10 6 g / mol , Mil - liporeSigma 52471 ) . Particles were imaged using confocal microscopy and their volume was estimated from the maximum surface area in the confocal image stack . Cell culture . Murine macrophage - like cells J774A . 1 ( ATCC , TIB - 67 ) were main - tained and subcultured according to the methods recommended by ATCC . Brie ﬂ y , cells were maintained in DMEM medium ( Gibco , 11965 – 092 ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( GemBio , 900 – 108 ) , and antibiotics and antimycotic ( Gibco , 15240 – 062 ) . Subcultures were prepared by scraping . Cultured cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) were obtained from Rag2 / OT - I transgenic mice ( Taconic ) . The animal protocols used for this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center . Brie ﬂ y , splenocytes from C57BL / 6J wild - type mice were pulsed for 2h with 100nM OVA 257 – 264 at 37 °C , washed to remove excess peptide , and then mixed with Rag2 / OT - I splenocytes for 2 days . On the second day , activated lymphoblasts were puri ﬁ ed by density gradient centrifugation and retrovirally transduced . Cells containing the transgene ( Lifeact - eGFP ) were then selected for 1 day and maintained until imaging on day 7 . All cultures were maintained in RPMI medium containing 10 % FBS ( VWR , 97068 – 085 ) and 30IU / mL human interleukin - 2 ( hIL - 2 ) ( Roche ) . Retroviral transfection . Phoenix E cells were ﬁ rst transfected with expression vectors for Lifeact - eGFP together with packaging plasmids via the calcium phos - phate method on the day of spleen harvesting . Ecotropic viral supernatants were then collected after 48 h at 37°C , ﬁ ltered through a 0 . 20µm sieve , and added to 1 . 5× 10 6 lymphoblasts on day 2 . These mixtures were centrifuged at 1400 g in the presence of polybrene ( 4 µg / mL ) at 35 °C for 2h . Cells were then split 1 : 3 in complete RPMI , and then grown , selected , and maintained as stated above until day 7 . Phagocytic assays . For phagocytic assays , cells were transferred to 12 - well glass bottom plates ( Cellvis , P12 – 1 . 5H - N ) ( 1 . 5× 10 5 cells / well ) . 1h before addition of DAAM - particles , the medium was replaced by L - 15 medium without serum . 15min before addition of the DAAM - particles Hoechst 33258 ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , H3569 ) was added for a ﬁ nal concentration of 1 μ g / mL in each well . The medium was then replaced with 200 μ L L - 15 per well including the DAAM - particles ( 7 . 5 ×10 5 DAAM - particles / well ) , the plate was spun for 1min at 300 g and incubated at 37 °C . Cells where ﬁ xed by direct addition of 1mL of 4 % for - maldehyde ( J . T . Baker , 2106 – 01 ) in PBS after 5 min for the phagocytic deformation assay ( Figs . 3 – 5 ) and after 30min for the uptake ef ﬁ ciency assay ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Cells were rinsed vigorously by pipetting up and down with PBS to remove particles not in contact with cells . Exposed surface of the particles was immu - nostained with 4 μ g / mL Alexa Fluor - 647 donkey anti - rabbit IgG ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , A31573 ) in PBS . After 30min the wells were rinsed with PBS ( 3× ) and imaged on a confocal microscope . Cytotoxic T lymphocyte assays . A # 1 . 0 8 - well coverglass chamber ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , 155411 ) was coated with biotinylated poly - L - lysine in water for 0 . 5h , blocked for 1h with 20 mg / mL BSA in HBS , and then washed extensively with PBS . To each well , 2× 10 5 DAAM - particles in PBS were added and left to settle overnight at 4°C . On the day of imaging , each well was washed gently but extensively with PBS to remove non - adherent particles , and then replaced with imaging medium ( colorless RPMI with 5 % FBS and 30 IU / mL hIL - 2 ) . Cells were washed twice with imaging medium to remove traces of phenol red from the original culture medium , and then incubated at 37 °C . Glass chambers containing DAAM - particles were ﬁ rst allowed to thermally equilibrate on the microscope stage at 37 °C . Then , planes / regions of interest containing evenly spaced DAAM - particles were selected by scanning across a given well at low laser power . Up to 2 ×10 5 cells were pipetted into the well and allowed to settle for ~ 2 min Once a suf ﬁ ciently bright T - cell – DAAM - particle conjugate of interest was identi ﬁ ed , time series image stacks were acquired on an instantaneous structured illumination microscopy ( iSIM ) system . For measurement of Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux in T cells , chamber slides with peptide - coated DAAM - particles ( 8 . 6 µm , 4 . 0kPa ) were prepared in a similar manner to the above . CTLs were loaded with 5 µg / mL Fura - 2AM , washed , and then added to the wells . Bright ﬁ eld , RFP , 340 nm , and 380 nm images were acquired every 10 s for ~ 35min Population Ca 2 + responses were analyzed using Slidebook software ( 3i ) as follows : after image background correction , masks were generated using Otsu thresholding and size exclusion ( 8 - µm minimum ) . Then , T - cell events that overlapped with DAAM - particle events for more than 2 frames ( 20 s ) were selected and the 340 / 380 intensity ratios were normalized using the baseline value before the initial rise . Microscopy . 3D confocal imaging was performed using a spinning disk CSU - W1 scanner unit ( Yokogawa ) and a DMi6 inverted microscope , equipped with a 100× NA 1 . 40 objective ( Leica Microsystems ) . Excitation was done with solid state lasers ( 100mW 488 nm , 50 mW 560nm , 100mW 642 nm ) and images were captured on an Ixon Ultra EMCCD camera ( Andor ) . Z - stacks with 100nm step size were recorded using a piezo stage insert ( LUDL Electronic Products , 96A900 ) . The setup was operated using MicroManager 46 . Edge localization precision and reference shape measurements were performed with the 50 mW 560 nm laser , where laser power output was varied between 1 – 50 % and image stacks were acquired with 50 ms exposure per slice ( 144 μ m× 144 μ m each ) . Instantaneous structured illumination microscopy ( iSIM ) was performed using a VisiTech iSIM scan head ( VisiTech International ) , an Optospin fast ﬁ lter wheel ( Cairn ) , and an IX73 microscope , equipped with a 60 × NA 1 . 3 silicone oil objective ( Olympus ) and a Hamamatsu Flash 4 . 0 v2 camera . For live cell imaging a WSKM - F1 stagetop incubator ( Tokai Hit ) was used . Images were acquired using MetaMorph software ( Molecular Devices ) . Microparticle 3D shape reconstruction . Image analysis was performed with cus - tom software in Matlab . Individual microparticles were segmented based on intensity thresholding confocal z - stacks , using the dip in the distribution of the logarithm of voxel intensities as the threshold . The centroid of DAAM - particles was estimated , and they were isolated in ~ 20×20×30 μ m regions of interest ( ROIs ) that were used for further processing . First , images were deconvolved with a point spread function ( PSF ) , measured ~ 8 μ m from the sample surface ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Deconvolution was performed with 25 iteration steps using a Landweber algorithm , and was imple - mented using DecovolutionLab 2 47 . Background subtraction was performed by averaging the Z - slices outside the ROI along the axial direction and subtraction of the resulting 2D image from each slice of the ROI . At this point , cubic interpolation along the z - axis was used to equalize the voxel dimensions . Edge detection was performed using the 3D Sobel operator 48 ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) , after which the total edge magnitude was calculated as the root - mean squared of the three resulting images . For superlocalization of edge coordinates , ﬁ rst a volume estimate of each DAAM - particle was made , based on the number of thresholded voxels , which was converted into a particle surface area estimate assuming a perfect sphere . The number of edge coor - dinates N was determined as the particle surface area divided by the area of a circle with radius 250nm ( for the DAAM - particles subjected to phagocytosis ) or 500nm ( for undeformed spheres , in which case we wanted to prevent correlation between neighboring points ) . Longitude φ and co - latitude θ for approximately equally spaced points were found as : φ ¼ n π 3 (cid:2) ﬃﬃﬃ 5 p (cid:1) (cid:3) mod 2 π , θ ¼ arccos 1 (cid:2) 2 n = ð N (cid:2) 1 Þ ð Þ , where n = 0 … . N − 1 . Modulus 2 π is taken , such that φ 2 0 ; 2 π ½ Þ . Cubic inter - polation was used to estimate the intensity values along lines originating from the particle centroid in the directions of the angles determined above . Then a Gaussian function was ﬁ t to each line pro ﬁ le to determine the location of the edge with subpixel precision . Smoothing of edge coordinates . Edge coordinates were smoothed ( for sphericity , curvature and force calculations ) using an equivalent of a 2D moving average , operating on the radial component of edge coordinates . Great circle distances ( d ) between edge coordinates with indices i and j were calculated along a perfect sphere : d ¼ arccos sin θ i sin θ j þ cos θ i cos θ j cos φ i (cid:2) φ j (cid:5) (cid:6) (cid:5) (cid:6) R ; where R is the equivalent diameter of a sphere to the particle . The radial component of the edge coordinates was then averaged within the given window size ( 1 μ m 2 ) . Calculation of particle properties . Calculation of particle properties was per - formed using custom Matlab software . A triangulation was generated between points with the same angular coordinates ( longitude and latitude ) as the particle edge coordinates , but on a unit sphere . Then a convex hull approach was used to connect all data points and not leave any gaps . The particle surface area ( S ) was then calculated as the sum of the surface areas of all triangles . The particle volume ( V ) was calculated as the sum of the ( signed ) volumes of tetrahedra , which were formed by connecting all triangles with an arbitrary point . The particle centroid was determined as the volume - weighted sum of the tetrahedra centroids . Before calculation of sphericity and surface curvature , the radial component of the edge NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13804 - z ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 20 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13804 - z | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 11 coordinates was ﬁ rst smoothed within a 1 μ m 2 window ( see above ) . This was done because of the high sensitivity of these measures to high - frequency noise . Sphericity was calculated as Ψ = ( 6 π 1 / 3 V 2 / 3 S − 1 ) / 2 1 / 3 , where the division by 2 1 / 3 was used when only the upper hemisphere was analyzed , as it is a correction that guarantees that Ψ cannot exceed 1 for non - closed shapes 49 . For surface curvature calculations , ﬁ rst principal curvatures ( k 1 and k 2 ) of the triangulated mesh were determined as described previously 50 , 51 . Finally , mean curvature H = ( k 1 + k 2 ) / 2 and Gaussian curvature K = k 1 k 2 were calculated . Local root - mean - squared surface roughness ( R rms ) measurements were performed by using great circle distances to ﬁ nd points within a 1 μ m 2 area ( as above , typically 6 – 8 points ) , and then taking the standard deviation of the radial component of these points . Global R rms was calculated similarly , but over the entire upper hemisphere . Stress - free boundary analysis . Analysis of the immunostaining of the free par - ticle surface was performed in custom Matlab software ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . First , images were deconvolved as described above . Then , cubic interpolation was used to estimate the intensity values along lines originating from the particle centroid ( as determined during particle shape analysis ) . A regular grid in spherical coordinates ( as opposed to an approximately equidistant grid used in particle shape analysis ) was used , to simplify later image processing steps ( in particular the active contour algorithm described below ) . The number of points in the regular grid was approximately equal to the number of points used for shape analysis . Generated line pro ﬁ les revealed a Gaussian intensity function , and the integrated intensity I tot under the Gaussian was determined . I tot was approximated as 1 . 065× I max × FWHM , where I max is the maximum ﬂ uorescent intensity , FWHM is the full width at half maximum of the Gaussian peak in the intensity pro ﬁ le and 1 . 065 is the prefactor that appears during integration . I tot appeared more uniform over the DAAM - particle surface than the I max , because of the non - isotropic resolution in confocal microscopy . After generating a regular grid with total intensity values , this signal was binarized , initially by using a dip in the distribution of the logarithm of pixel intensities as the threshold . Then , a region - based active contour ( or snake ) algorithm 52 was used to optimize the mask . Finally , interpolation of the mask was used to determine for each particle edge coordinate if it was part of the freely exposed surface . For live cytotoxic T - cell assays , the LifeAct - eGFP ﬂ uorescence signal was used for determination of the cell - contact area . However , radial line pro ﬁ les of the ﬂ uorescent signal was not approximated by a Gaussian function , and instead the pixel intensities up to 1 μ m from the particle edge were summed . Reference - free estimation of stresses from particle shape . Force calculations were performed with custom Python package ShElastic 19 . The particle shapes were smoothed within a 1 μ m 2 window , and the edge of the traction - free boundary was dilated ( Supplementary Note 4 ) . Resolving traction forces from the particle shape can be formulated as a linear elasticity problem on the sphere Ω subjected to the constraints that the deformed shape matches the measured shape and that the traction force is zero on the traction - free region . For small - strain linear elasticity problems , the equilibrium condition ( based on generalized Hooke ’ s law ) of an isotropic elastic continuum Ω can be expressed in terms of the displacement ﬁ eld u as : μ ∇ 2 u þ μ 1 (cid:2) 2 v (cid:5) (cid:6) ∇ ∇ (cid:3) u ð Þ ¼ 0 ; ð 2 Þ where μ is the shear modulus and v the Poisson ’ s ratio . This equation corresponds to the condition of static equilibrium in the absence of body forces , which are likely negligible compared to total surface traction forces . The deformed shape of the sphere corresponding to any displacement ﬁ eld u can be represented as a radial function r ( θ , φ ) , which is the distance between the origin and the deformed surface . Let r s ( θ , φ ) be the radial function of the measured 3D shape . Hence the constraints on the elasticity problem can be written as r θ ; φ ð Þ ¼ r s θ ; φ ð Þ ; T j ∂ Ω t ¼ 0 . We approach this problem by solving a series of elasticity problems on the sphere , each subjected to a different surface displacement ﬁ eld that satis ﬁ es the measured shape exactly . The surface displacement ﬁ eld is adjusted iteratively to reduce the traction on the traction - free region . The surface displacement ﬁ eld is sampled on a Gauss - Legendre quadratic ( GLQ ) mesh θ 0 ; φ 0 (cid:1) (cid:3) i ; i ¼ 1 ¼ N . The surface displacement ﬁ eld u ( θ , φ ) can be represented on every mesh node in spherical coordinates as ( Δ r , Δ θ , Δ φ ) i , where ( Δ θ , Δ φ ) i are our fundamental degrees of freedom , and Δ r i are obtained by projecting the mesh nodes onto the measured shape in the deformed state . Given the trial surface displacement ﬁ eld u ( θ , φ ) , we ﬁ rst transform it to Cartesian coordinates , u j θ ; φ ð Þ ; j ¼ x ; y ; z , and then expand it into spherical harmonic space up to degree l ≤ l max : u j θ ; φ ð Þ ¼ X l max l ¼ 0 X l m ¼(cid:2) l ^ u jlm Y ml θ ; φ ð Þ ; ð 3 Þ where ^ u jlm are coef ﬁ cients , and Y ml is the spherical harmonic function de ﬁ ned in Supplementary Note 5 . We then use the spherical harmonics method 19 to obtain the corresponding surface traction ﬁ eld T ( θ , φ ) that satis ﬁ es the equilibrium condition ( 2 ) . In this work l max = 20 , which was chosen as a good balance between lateral spatial resolution ( ~ 750nm ) and computational time ( ~ 0 . 007 s per traction evaluation ) . The surface traction ﬁ eld is also expressed in the spherical harmonic space : T j θ ; φ ð Þ ¼ X l max l ¼ 0 X l m ¼(cid:2) l ^ T jlm Y ml θ ; φ ð Þ ; ð 4 Þ where ^ T jlm are coef ﬁ cients that are completely determined by ^ u jlm . We de ﬁ ne a measure of residual traction magnitude on the traction - free region as R T ; ∂ Ω t ð Þ . Therefore , our goal is to determine ( Δ θ , Δ φ ) i that minimizes R T ; ∂ Ω t ð Þ . However , the solution of such a problem is not necessarily unique . Therefore , we solve an alternative optimization problem : min u s f g f u s ð Þ ; ð 5 Þ f u s ð Þ ¼ E el þ α R 2 T ; ∂ Ω t ð Þ þ β E pen T ð Þ ; ð 6 Þ where the cost function f has contributions from : ( 1 ) the elastic energy E el ; ( 2 ) the traction residual R T ; ∂ Ω t ð Þ ; ( 3 ) an anti - aliasing ﬁ lter ( Supplementary Note 3 ) . The elastic energy is included to favor lower energy solutions , which are likely to be more realistic . Since R , E el , E pen all have different units , the parameters α and β have the appropriate units to make f have the unit of pJ . The selection of appropriate α and β values is illustrated in Supplementary Fig . 10 . For minimization of f ( u s ) , we used the conjugate - gradient algorithm implemented in SciPy . Convergence was reached after ~ 5000 iterations , while during each iteration the cost function and its gradient were evaluated ~ 20 times . The residual traction magnitude on the traction - free region is calculated as : R T ; ∂ Ω t ð Þ ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 N X θ 0 þ Δ θ ; φ 0 þ Δ φ ð Þ 2 ∂ Ω t T i θ 0 ; φ 0 (cid:1) (cid:3) w θ 0 ð Þ (cid:7)(cid:7) (cid:7)(cid:7) 2 vuut ; i ¼ 1 ¼ N ; ð 7 Þ where N ¼ l max þ 1 ð Þ 2 l max þ 1 ð Þ is the total number of GLQ mesh nodes and w ( θ ) = sin θ is the weight function to prevent over - sampling of data points at the poles compared to the equator ( Supplementary Note 2 ) . Due to the orthogonality of spherical harmonic functions , the elastic energy can be calculated as a sum over all spherical harmonic modes : E el ¼ 2 π r 20 X 3 j ¼ 0 X l max l ¼ 0 X l m ¼(cid:2) l ^ u jlm h i (cid:4) ^ T jlm ; ð 8 Þ where [ u ] * represents the complex conjugate of u ; See Supplementary Note 5 for derivation . Displacement solution based on spherical harmonics . As we are using an iterative method for solving the elasticity problem , it is essential to have fast computation of the shape T ( θ , φ ) from the surface displacement ﬁ eld u ( θ , φ ) . The spherical harmonics method was previously developed as a fast solver for linear elasticity problems with spherical interfaces 19 . Brie ﬂ y , the method can solve the stress ﬁ eld σ ( r , θ , φ ) and the displacement ﬁ eld u ( r , θ , φ ) everywhere in the elastic medium Ω , given the traction boundary condition T b ( θ , φ ) or the displacement boundary condition u b ( θ , φ ) on the spherical interface ∂ Ω . Using fast spherical harmonic transformation as provided by SHTools 53 , the spherical harmonics method is more ef ﬁ cient and accurate than other general elasticity problem solvers such as ﬁ nite element methods ( FEM ) 19 . The implementation of the method is available online as ShElastic toolbox 19 . In particular , ShElastic toolbox pre - calculates a complete set of fundamental displacement solutions with u ( K ) that satisfy the equilibrium Eq . ( 1 ) : u K ð Þ ¼ 1 2 μ (cid:2) 4 1 (cid:2) ν ð Þ ψ K ð Þ þ ∇ r (cid:3) ψ K ð Þ (cid:5) (cid:6) h i ; ð 9 Þ where the displacement potential vector ψ ( K ) is de ﬁ ned in spherical coordinates as : ψ K ð Þ ¼ ψ k ; l ; m ð Þ r ; θ ; φ ð Þ ¼ ^ e k r l Y ml θ ; φ ð Þ ; ð 10 Þ where K ð Þ ¼ k ; l ; m ð Þ ; k ¼ x ; y ; z ; l ¼ 0 ; 1 ; 2 ; ¼ ; m ¼ 0 ; 1 ; ¼ ; l ð Þ indicates the 3 - value index of the solution . The corresponding stress ﬁ eld σ ( K ) ( r , θ , φ ) in Ω , and the traction ﬁ eld T ( K ) ( θ , φ ) on ∂ Ω are also pre - calculated . Then , the physical properties can be written as a linear combination of the fundamental solutions : σ ¼ X K a K σ K ð Þ ; u ¼ X K a K u K ð Þ ; T ¼ X K a K T K ð Þ ; ð 11 Þ which are in ﬁ nite series . In practice , we select a cut - off of 0 ≤ l ≤ l max , and select all the m and k modes within the selected l modes to guarantee the symmetry of the deformation . The solution converges with exponentially decreasing error as l max increases . The solution is searched on the solution space a K as a vector . Confocal voxel size calibration . Differences in axial ( z ) versus lateral ( x , y ) length measurements can arise from imperfect calibration of the microscope stage , and from refractive index mismatch between the sample and the immersion oil / cov - erglass . Hence , accurate calibration is necessary for proper reconstruction of the ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13804 - z 12 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 20 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 13804 - z | www . nature . com / naturecommunications particle shape . First , confocal image stacks of 10 μ m yellow - green ﬂ uorescent polystyrene beads ( Polysciences , 18142 ) were recorded . Then , maximum intensity axial slices through individual particles were selected , and smoothed with a Gaussian ﬁ lter ( with a standard deviation of 3 pixels ) . Subsequently , edges of the homogeneously stained microspheres were detected using the 2D Sobel operator . The z - location of the equator , and the diameter of the particle , was determined by ﬁ nding the horizontal line were the distance between the edges ( at opposite sides of the particle ) was maximal . Gaussian ﬁ ts to the edge pro ﬁ les were made to accu - rately determine the particle diameter . Next , the edge at the apex of the lower hemisphere of the particle ( the south pole ) was localized using a similar approach . This difference in z - position of the equatorial plane with the south pole was used to estimate the apparent particle radius in z - direction . This approach , were only the lower hemisphere is used , prevents these measurements to be affected by the lensing effect caused by the particle ( Fig . 1i , Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Finally , the ratio of the particle radius measured in xy and the apparent particle radius in z was determined for multiple particles and averaged . In PBS , we found an axial elon - gation of 1 . 100 ± 0 . 003 ( standard error of the mean ( s . e . m . ) , n = 34 ) . In Vectashield ( VS ) we did not perform such a correction , since particles did not appear elongated in the axial direction ( Fig . 2 ) . Point spread function measurements . For measurements of point spread func - tions ( PSFs ) , red or yellow - green 100 nm ﬂ uorescent beads ( Thermo Fisher Sci - enti ﬁ c , F8801 / F8803 ) were embedded in ﬂ at adherent pAAm gels . Such hydrogels were prepared similarly to described previously : 54 , 55 clean 25 mm glass coverslips were incubated for 0 . 5 h in 2 M sodium hydroxide . Coverslips were rinsed with distilled water and then incubated in 0 . 5 % 3 - Aminopropyltriethoxysilane ( APTES ) ( Sigma , 919 - 30 - 2 ) in 95 % ethanol . Coverslips were again rinsed with water and incubated in 0 . 05 % glutaraldehyde for 1h , then rinsed with water and dried at 200 o C . pAAm hydrogels consisting of acrylamide , and crosslinker N , N ′ - methy - lenebisacrylamide were made with C T ( C AAm + C BIS ) 55 mg / mL , C C ( C BIS / ( C AAm + C BIS ) ) 1 . 8 % ( w / w ) in distilled water . 2× 10 − 5 % ( v / v ) 100nm ﬂ uorescent beads and 0 . 8 % ( v / v ) TEMED were added to the mixture . 0 . 6mg / mL ammonium per - sulfate ( APS ) ( Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , BP179 ) was added to initiate gel polymerization . A 3 . 6 μ L drop of the mixture was added to a coverslip and was covered with a 12mm untreated circular glass coverslip , which was gently pushed down . Polymerization was continued for 20min at room temperature after which the small coverslip was removed . Gels were kept and imaged in PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) or in the mounting medium Vectashield ( Vector Laboratories , H - 1000 ) . Data was analyzed using custom Matlab software . Only beads that had no neighbors in a region of interest of 5 ×5 × 10 μ m ( x × y × z ) around them were used for the analysis . After background sub - traction , the total ﬂ uorescent signal of individual particles was normalized to 1 . Particles were centered with subpixel resolution based on their weighted centroid ( linear interpolation was used to approximate new pixel values ) . The position of the coverslip ( z = 0 ) was determined based on background ﬂ uorescent signal , allowing us the measure the height of each particle with respect to the coverslip . Finally , the ﬂ uorescent signal of multiple particles ( n > 50 ) , with similar distances from the coverslip , was averaged . Reporting summary .
