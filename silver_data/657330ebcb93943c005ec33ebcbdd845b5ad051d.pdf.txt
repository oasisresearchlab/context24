Inhibition of dynamin , a GTPase involved in clathrin - medi - ated endocytosis and regulation of the cell cycle , has been proposed as a potential anti - can - cer regimen , but the effects of dynamin inhibition on leukemia cells has not been extensively addressed . Here we adopted single cell and whole - population analysis by flow cytometry and live imaging , to assess the effect of dynamin inhibition ( Dynasore , Dyngo - 4a , MitMAB ) on pediatric acute leukemia cell lines ( CCRF - CEM and THP - 1 ) , human bone marrow biop - sies from patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , as well as in a model of lymphoma ( EL4 ) - induced tumor growth in mice . All inhibitors suppressed proliferation and induced pronounced caspase - dependent apoptotic cell death in CCRF - CEM and THP - 1 cell lines . However , the inhibitors showed no effect on bone marrow biopsies , and did not prevent EL4 - induced tumor formation in mice . We conclude that dynamin inhibition affects highly proliferating human leukemia cells . These findings form a basis for evaluation of the potential , and constraints , of employing dynamin inhibition in treatment strategies against leukemia and other malignancies . Introduction Acute leukemia is characterized by a rapid expansion of hematopoietic precursors ( blast cells ) , which remain partially differentiated and proliferate in the bone marrow and peripheral blood as the disease progresses [ 1 ] . Two of the most common types of pediatric acute leukemias are acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) and acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . ALL is the most prevalent type of cancer in children ( 80 % of leukemias and 25 % of childhood cancers ) [ 2 , 3 ] , and 10 – 15 % of these cases represent T - cell ALL ( T - ALL ) . T - ALL arises from T - lymphoblasts in the thymus as a result of an accumulation of mutations in immature thymocytes , altering inter alia cell proliferation and differentiation . The lymphoblasts leave the thymus and access PLOS ONE PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0256708 September 7 , 2021 1 / 19 a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : von BeekC , Alriksson L , Palle J , GustafsonA - M , Grujic M , MeloFR , et al .

Christopher von Beek receivedsalary the circulation , from where other organs such as the bone marrow or central nervous system are invaded [ 2 ] . AML constitutes about 20 % of all childhood leukemias [ 4 ] and is caused by abnormal myeloblasts ( immature leukocytes of the myeloid lineage ) . Cancerous myeloblasts have the ability of constant proliferation and avoidance of cell death , leading to an expansion in the myeloblast population and to a disturbed hematopoiesis [ 5 ] . Standard treatment of acute leukemia involves combination chemotherapy . Improved treatment strategies and reduced relapse has increased the 5 - year survival to 90 % [ 6 ] . However , in ALL , still 15 % of the patients relapse [ 3 ] and AML has an overall survival rate of only 60 – 70 % [ 7 ] . In addition , a major obstacle for the standard treatments are adverse side effects lead - ing to long term organ damage associated with osteonecrosis , thrombosis , neurotoxicity , or chronic pancreatitis [ 8 ] . Therefore , new therapeutics with higher specificity are needed to increase the survival and quality of life for patients with childhood leukemia . One potential chemotherapeutic strategy in leukemia would be to inhibit dynamin , a key component of the machinery for clathrin - mediated endocytosis and also for cytokinesis [ 9 – 11 ] . Indeed , this strategy has been evaluated previously , but only to a limited extent in leukemia and other cell types [ 12 – 16 ] . The most well - studied inhibitor of dynamin is Dynasore , which inhibits the GTP - hydrolase activity of dynamin [ 17 ] . Dynasore has been shown to affect multi - ple biological processes [ 18 ] . However , comparative studies employing interference with dyna - min expression demonstrated that the observed effects might depend partially or completely on targets other than dynamin [ 19 ] . Due to other unfavorable properties of Dynasore , such as binding to serum proteins or loss of activity due to binding to detergents , multiple derivatives of Dynasore have been assessed . These efforts have resulted in the development of Dyngo - 4a , which acts by a similar mechanism as Dynasore , but with a higher bioavailability [ 20 ] . Myristyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ( MitMAB ) is another , small molecule dynamin inhibitor , which reversibly targets the interaction of dynamin with phospholipids and thereby blocks the recruitment of dynamin to the membrane [ 21 ] . MitMAB was shown to inhibit dynamin’s GTPase - activity , and to inhibit receptor - mediated endocytosis in several cell types [ 22 ] . In vivo studies employing MitMAB are lacking to date . However , an ex vivo approach using rat kidneys did not result in visible symptoms of toxicity [ 23 ] . Chircop and colleagues per - formed a number of studies evaluating MitMAB as a potential anti - cancer agent . They reported that MitMAB inhibited the dynamin - dependent abscission in cytokinesis , leading to suppressed proliferation and polyploidy in a wide range of human cancer cell lines , while showing less toxicity for primary fibroblasts [ 24 ] . Dynamin inhibition is thereby emerging as a potential chemotherapeutic strategy , but its mechanism of action is not completely under - stood . Moreover , its effects on hematopoietic cancers have not been extensively evaluated to date . Here we addressed the effects of dynamin inhibition on leukemia cells , focusing on lym - phoblastic and monocytic leukemia cells . Moreover , we addressed the mechanism through which dynamin acts on leukemia cells , and evaluated the in vivo toxicity and effect of dynamin inhibition in an EL4 lymphoma tumor model in mice . Materials and methods Cell lines and culture We used CCRF - CEM ( ATCC , CCL - 19 ) , a T - lymphoblast cell line derived from peripheral blood as model for ALL . THP - 1 ( ATCC , TIB - 202 ) is a monocytic cell line representing AML . Cells were kept in RPMI - 1640 ( Sigma - Aldrich , # R5886 ) , supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Gibco , # 10500 – 064 ) , 2 mM L - glutamine ( Sigma - Aldrich , # G7513 ) , 100 U / ml penicillin and 100 μ g / ml streptomycin ( Sigma - Aldrich , # P0781 ) in 5 % CO 2 at 37˚C .

EL4 ( ATCC , TIB - 39 ) , a mouse T - lympho - blast leukemia cell line , was used for tumor generation in mice . EL4 cells were cultured as indi - cated for CCRF - CEM cells above , but at a 4 mM L - glutamine concentration in the medium . K562 ( ATCC , CCL - 243 ) , a cell line representing chronic myelogenous leukemia , was cultured in RPMI - 1640 with glutamax ( Gibco , # 72400 ) supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate ( Gibco , # 11360 – 070 ) , FBS and streptomycin and penicillin as above . All centrifugations were performed at room temperature ( RT ) for 5 min , 300 x g . Human peripheral blood - derived mononuclear cells Blood was obtained from healthy donors ( Ethical permission : Etikpro¨vningsmyndigheten , Dnr 2020 – 05080 ) after having obtained written consent . Mononuclear cells were purified with Percoll ( Sigma - Aldrich , P1644 ) gradient centrifugation ( 30 min , 1000 x g , RT ) . Cells were washed 3 x in PBS ( 5 min , 300 x g , RT ) and cell viability was determined by trypan blue stain - ing . Mononuclear cells were used for experiments directly after isolation , and were kept in RPMI - 1640 with Glutamax supplemented with sodium pyruvate , FBS and streptomycin and penicillin as described above for K562 cells . Human bone marrow cells Bone marrow samples were obtained from ALL pediatric patients ( Ethical permission : Etik - pro¨vningsmyndigheten , Dnr 2014 / 233 ; Uppsala Biobank application no BbA - 827 - 2019 - 067 ) , after having obtained written consents from parents / caretaker and from the child ( where applicable ) . After thawing , bone marrow cells were washed and cultured in complete Stem - Pro - 34 SFM ( Gibco , # 10639011 ) , including 2 mM L - glutamine , 100 U / ml Penicillin and 100 μ g / ml Streptomycin . Viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion . The cell concentra - tions were adjusted to 0 . 5 x 10 6 cells / ml . Cells were treated with medium or MitMAB diluted in medium for 8 h and 24 h , followed by flow cytometry analysis . Mice and EL4 tumor model C57BL / 6J mice ( 8 – 16 weeks old ) were used for experiments . All experiments were approved by the local ethics committee ( Uppsala djurfo¨rso¨ksetiska na¨mnd , Dnr 5 . 8 . 18 - 04096 / 2019 ) . Prior to injection , EL4 cells were resuspended in Hanks’ balanced salt solution ( Sigma - Aldrich , # H6648 ) and the cell concentration was adjusted to 0 . 5 x 10 6 cells / ml . A total of 5 x 10 4 EL4 cells ( 100 μ l of cell suspension ) were injected subcutaneously in the hip region ( both sides ) . From day 3 or 7 post - injection , intraperitoneal treatment with 5 or 10 mg / kg / day ( 3 – 4 times / week ) MitMAB in PBS , or PBS only ( vehicle ) ( 100 – 200 μ l per mouse ) was initiated and the mice were examined for weight loss / gain . Tumor size was determined with a caliper ( tumor volume = ( a x b 2 ) / 2 , with a : length , b : width ) . Mice were sacrificed when one tumor reached 1100 mm 3 . Viability assay 0 . 05 – 0 . 15 x 10 6 cells / ml in 100 μ l / well were transferred to 96 - well plates ( Sarstedt , # 83 . 3924 ) and treated with Dyngo - 4a ( Selleck Chemicals , # 8047 ) , Dynasore monohydrate ( Sigma - Aldrich , # D763 ) or MitMAB ( Tocris , # 4224 ) . Where indicated , 20 μ M of the pan - caspase inhibitor Z - VAD - FMK ( BioVision , # 1140 ) was added 1 h prior to treatment with dynamin inhibitors . As controls served the respective diluent ( Cyclodextrin ; Sigma - Aldrich , # C - 4805 ) or PBS ( Medicago , # 009 - 9400 - 100 , for MitMAB ) .

Fluorescence after blank subtraction ( medium ) were normalized to controls . Cell cycle analysis 1 ml of 0 . 15 x 10 6 cells / ml suspensions of CCRF - CEM or THP - 1 cells were treated with 40 μ M Dynasore , 10 μ M Dyngo - 4a , 3 μ M MitMAB , 10 μ M RO - 3306 ( Sigma - Aldrich , # ML0569 ) , 0 . 5 μ g / ml Paclitaxel ( Taxol , Sigma - Aldrich , T7402 ) and 2 μ g / ml Cytochalasin D ( Sigma - Aldrich , # C8273 ) or vehicle ( DMSO for cell cycle inhibitors , otherwise as above ) for 18 h before processing cells for flow cytometry . Transferrin uptake assay CCRF - CEM and THP - 1 cells were washed once in RPMI - 1640 containing 1 % BSA ( Sigma - Aldrich , # A9418 ) and serum starved for 1 h and an additional 1 h after addition of 5 μ M Mit - MAB in round bottom 96 well plates ( Thermo Scientific , # 163320 ) ; 200 μ l / well , 0 . 15 x 10 6 cells / ml . 25 μ g / ml ( final concentration ) Transferrin - AlexaFluor 488 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # T13342 ) was added for the indicated time periods , followed by washing in RPMI - 1640 1 % BSA and measurement of cell - associated fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry . Flow cytometry For viability , cells were stained in annexin V - binding buffer ( BD , # 556454 ) with 0 . 5 % annexin V - FITC ( BD , # 556419 ) and 150 nM DRAQ7 ( Biostatus , # DR71000 ) prior to measurement by either a MACSQuant VYB ( Miltenyibiotec ) , an Accuri C6 Plus ( BD ) or a Cytoflex S ( Beckman Coulter ) . For proliferation , the Click - iT ™ EdU Cell Proliferation Kit was used with Alexa Fluor 647 ( Invitrogen , # C10424 ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol , but using half of the staining reagents in the click reaction step . 10 μ M EdU was added 2 h prior to the assay . For caspase - 3 / 7 detection , cells were resuspended in PBS containing 500 nM caspase - 3 / 7 probe ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # C10423 ) and 5 % FBS , and incubated for 30 min under standard culture conditions prior to flow cytometry analysis . Cells used for cell cycle analysis were resuspended in PBS containing 0 . 1 % Triton - X - 100 ( Sigma - Aldrich , # T8787 ) , 10 μ g / ml RNase A ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # EN0531 ) and 10 μ g / ml Propidium Iodide ( Sigma - Aldrich , # 81845 ) and incubated for 20 – 30 min in the dark at RT . For ALL bone marrow biopsies , cells were stained in annexin V - binding buffer containing 2 % FBS , 0 . 5 % annexin V - Pacific Blue ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # R37177 ) and 1 μ M SYTOX Green ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # S7020 ) . Data analysis was performed using the FlowJo software ( TreeStar Inc . ) . Live microscopy 250 μ l cell suspension ( 0 . 15 x 10 6 cells / ml ) in medium containing 150 nM DRAQ7 and 500 nM CellEvent ™ Caspase - 3 / 7 were added to 8 - well chamber slides ( Nunc 1 Lab - Tek 1 II—CC 2 ™ Chamber Slide ™ ; ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Slides were incubated at 37˚C ( 5 % CO 2 ) during microscopy and equilibrated in the microscope chamber 1 h prior to the start of the experi - ment . Images were acquired on a custom - built microscope , based on a Nikon Ti2 body , every 10 min in differential interference contrast ( DIC ) , red and green fluorescence channels with a Prime 95B ( Photometrics ) camera through a 10X / 0 . 45 NA Plan Apochromatic objective ( Nikon ) .

Results Dynamin inhibitors potently decrease survival of acute leukemia cell lines First , we investigated the effects of three different dynamin inhibitors on the CCRF - CEM and THP - 1 cell lines , as models for pediatric ALL and AML , respectively . All inhibitors induced a prominent reduction in viability in both cell lines ( Fig 1A , 1B , 1D , 1E , 1G and 1H ) . The effects of all inhibitors showed time - and concentration - dependency , and the effects lasted at least up to 72 h . Among the assessed inhibitors , MitMAB was most efficient , followed by Dyngo - 4a Fig 1 . Dynamin inhibitors decrease the viability of acute leukemia cells . CCRF - CEM ( A , D , G ; ) , THP - 1 ( B , E , H ) or human PBMCs ( C , F , I ) ( 0 . 15 x 10 6 cells / ml ) were cultured for the time points indicated with the given concentrations of Dynasore ( A - C ) , Dyngo - 4a ( D - F ) or MitMAB ( G - I ) . Viability was assessed with PrestoBlue and was normalized to untreated control ( 0 μ M ) groups . Data are given as mean + SEM pooled from 5 – 9 biological replicates . Two - way ANOVA was used for statistical testing with Dunnett’s posthoc test in order to compare each treated group with the control at each time point . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0256708 . g001 PLOS ONE Dynamin and leukemia PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0256708 September 7 , 2021 5 / 19 and Dynasore . It was also noted that THP - 1 cells were relatively resistant to low concentrations of Dynasore and Dyngo - 4a ( Fig 1B and 1E ) , whereas MitMAB showed a high efficacy on THP - 1 cells also at low concentrations ( Fig 1H ) . In addition , we found that K562 cells , repre - senting a myelogenous leukemia cell line , were susceptible to dynamin inhibition , although with somewhat lower sensitivity in comparison with the THP - 1 and CCRF - CEM cells ( S1 Fig ) . We also assessed whether dynamin inhibition had the capacity to suppress peripheral blood - derived mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) , a population comprising both monocytes and lymphocytes . However , neither of the dynamin inhibitors had any substantial cytotoxic effects on these cells after a 24 h incubation period ( Fig 1C , 1F and 1I ) . Notably , one of the dynamin inhibitors ( MitMAB ) appeared to cause a slightly enhanced cell survival at early time points , while such effects were not seen for the other two assessed dynamin inhibitors . After 48 h , a limited reduction in viability was seen at the higher concentrations of Dynasore and MitMAB ( Fig 1C and 1I ) . This suggests that dynamin inhibition has a more pronounced inhibitory effect on leukemia cell lines than on healthy PBMCs kept in culture . Dynamin inhibitors induce leukemia cell apoptosis To gain insight into the mechanism of viability loss induced by the dynamin inhibition , we performed staining with annexin V ( binds to phosphatidylserine ) and DRAQ7 ( nuclear dye that enters permeabilized cells ) ( Fig 2 ; gating strategy shown in Fig 2A ) . As seen in Fig 2B , treatment of CCRF - CEM cells with Dynasore for 24 h resulted in an increased proportion of early apoptotic cells ( annexin V + / DRAQ7 - ) , although late apoptotic / necrotic ( annexin V + / DRAQ7 + ) cells were also observed . After treatment of the CCRF - CEM cells with Dyngo - 4a or MitMAB for a similar time period , early apoptotic cells were again detected , but a higher pro - portion of late apoptotic / necrotic cells were observed in comparison with the Dynasore treat - ment ( Fig 2D and 2F ) . A significant increase in the proportion of early apoptotic cells was also seen after treatment of THP - 1 cells with the dynamin inhibitors ( Fig 2C , 2E and 2G ) . However , treatment of THP - 1 cells with high concentrations of Dynasore , or with modest concentra - tions of MitMAB , resulted in a large proportion of late apoptotic / necrotic cells ( Fig 2C , 2E and 2G ) . Nevertheless , these data suggest that dynamin inhibition elicits apoptosis in leukemia cell lines . Dynamin inhibitors reduce the proliferation of leukemia cells Next , we investigated whether dynamin inhibition affected the proliferative capacity of the leu - kemia cells . For this , we labeled cells with EdU , a thymidine analogue used for quantification of DNA synthesis , and measured EdU incorporation by flow cytometry . As seen in Fig 3A and 3B , all of the dynamin inhibitors caused a significant reduction in the proliferation of both CCRF - CEM and THP - 1 cells . Notably , THP - 1 cells were somewhat more sensitive than were the CCRF - CEM cells . MitMAB - induced cell death involves caspase - 3 / 7 activation A hallmark feature of apoptotic cell death is the generation of active caspase - 3 / 7 . Since our data suggest that leukemia cells subjected to dynamin inhibition show signs of apoptosis , we assessed whether this is accompanied by caspase - 3 / 7 activation . These experiments revealed a robust activation of caspase - 3 / 7 in response to all dynamin inhibitors , both in the CCRF - CEM and THP - 1 cells ( Fig 4A and 4B ) . In the presence of Z - VAD - FMK , a pan - caspase inhibitor , caspase - 3 / 7 activities were significantly reduced ( Fig 4A and 4B ) . To assess the functional impact of caspase activation upon dynamin inhibition , we next analyzed leukemia cell survival . As depicted in Fig 4C and 4D , caspase inhibition by Z - VAD - FMK caused a significant , PLOS ONE Dynamin and leukemia PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0256708 September 7 , 2021 6 / 19 Fig 2 .

EdU was added to a final concentration of 10 μ M 2 h prior to flow cytometry analysis . The proportion of proliferating ( EdU + ) cells was normalized to untreated cells .

The only exception to this was seen after treatment of THP - 1 cells with Dyngo - 4a , where only a modest impact on cell viability was observed ( Fig 4D , see also Fig 1D ) , and where no protective effective of Z - VAD - FMK was observed within 24 h ( Fig 4D ) . Caspase - 3 / 7 activation precedes cell death in dynamin - inhibited leukemia cells To provide further insight into the dynamics by which dynamin inhibition triggers cell death in leukemia cells , we used live microscopy , in which we monitored caspase - 3 / 7 activation and DRAQ7 staining ( i . e . , cells with a permeabilized plasma membrane ) in real time after addition of 5 μ M MitMAB . In line with results above ( Figs 1G , 1H , 2F and 2G ) , MitMAB elicited mod - est caspase - 3 / 7 activation in CCRF - CEM cells within the first 24 h , whereas pronounced cas - pase - 3 / 7 activation was seen in THP - 1 cells ( Fig 5A and 5B ) . This analysis further revealed that , in CCRF - CEM cells , caspase - 3 / 7 activation was seen starting from ~ 8 – 12 h , and overt cell death ( as judged by DRAQ7 positivity ) was observed from 24 h and onwards ( Fig 5A and S1 and S2 Movies ) . In THP - 1 cells , the first signs of cell death were seen from ~ 8 h ( Fig 5B and S3 and S4 Movies ) . Also here , individual dynamin - inhibited cells first turned caspase - 3 / 7 - posi - tive , and thereafter DRAQ7 - positive ( S4 Movie ) . Dynamin - induced cell toxicity is independent of cell cycle inhibition , but interferes with transferrin uptake In the next set of experiments we investigated whether dynamin inhibition in leukemia cells had an impact on the regulation of a specific cell cycle stage , in analogy with previous studies in HeLa and H460 cells where dynamin inhibition was proposed to target cytokinesis [ 27 ] . However , the inhibition of dynamin by Dyngo - 4a or MitMAB did not alter the distribution of cells in the various cell cycle phases , nor did it result in an increased population of polyploid cells , either in CCRF - CEM or in THP - 1 cells ( Fig 6A – 6F ) . Dynasore even produced a small , but statistically significant , reduction of cells in G2 / M , both in CCRF - CEM and THP - 1 cells ( Fig 6A – 6F ) . As positive controls , we assessed the effects of the cdk1 inhibitor RO - 3306 ( arrests the cell cycle in the G2 / M transition ) , paclitaxel ( Taxol ; arrests cells in metaphase ) and cytochalasin D ( arrests cells in the cytokinesis phase ) [ 28 – 30 ] . As seen in Fig 6A – 6F , all of these compounds caused a profound reduction in the proportion of cells in G1 phase , accom - panied by a corresponding increase in the G2 / M population . As expected , these established cell cycle inhibitors , in particular cytochalasin D , caused an increase in the proportion of poly - ploid cells , in line with defective cytokinesis . By sharp contrast , neither of the dynamin inhibi - tors caused an increase in the population of polyploid cells ( Fig 6E and 6F ) . Inhibition of endocytosis provides the other plausible mechanism for the cytotoxicity of dynamin inhibitors . We therefore explored whether MitMAB affects endocytosis in the leuke - mia cells , as determined by uptake of fluorescent transferrin . Indeed , MitMAB had a signifi - cant inhibitory effect on transferrin uptake in both CCRF - CEM and THP - 1 cells ( Fig 6G and 6H ) . Notably , MitMAB had a more profound inhibitory impact on transferrin endocytosis in the THP - 1 cells in comparison with its effects on the CCRF - CEM cells ( Fig 6G and 6H ) , which agrees well with the especially strong inhibitory effect of MitMAB on THP - 1 viability ( Figs 1G , 1H , 4C and 4D ) .

For these experiments we assessed the effects of MitMAB , based on its superior potency in comparison with Dynasore and Dyngo - 4a on CCRF - CEM and THP - 1 cells ( see Fig 1 ) . However , MitMAB did not cause reduced viability / increased amount of apoptotic or late apoptotic cells , except for a tendency at the highest concentration ( 5 μ M ) over 24 h ( Fig 7A – 7D ) . It should be noted that non - cul - ture - adapted bone marrow samples initially grow slowly in culture ( compared to the adapted cell lines ) and exhibit a comparatively high level of spontaneous cell death . Hence , these results may suggest that dynamin inhibition preferentially affects leukemia cells under conditions of fast growth . Dynamin inhibition does not affect tumor growth in a mouse lymphoma model Next , we investigated whether dynamin inhibition has the capacity to reduce tumor growth in a mouse model . For this we used a model utilizing subcutaneous injection of EL4 lymphoma cells into mice . In this setting we again used MitMAB , based on its observed more potent effects on leukemia cells in comparison with other tested dynamin inhibitors ( see Fig 1 ) . First , we conducted experiments to assess whether MitMAB was cytotoxic for the suspension - grow - ing mouse lymphoma cells . Indeed , MitMAB caused reduced viability of the EL4 cells , with similar potency as for the CCRF - CEM and THP - 1 cells ( Fig 8A ) . To assess the general tolera - bility of mice for MitMAB , the compound was injected at 5 or 10 mg / kg / day ( 3 times / week ) . These experiments revealed that MitMAB at 5 mg / kg / day had minimal impact on the behavior of the animals , and no adverse effects on weight were seen ( Fig 8B ) . However , at 10 mg / kg / day , MitMAB caused reduction of body weight at early time points after initiating treatment . This is an indication that the drug was taken up and had systemic effects . The body weights of the animals partially recovered after 20 days of treatment ( Fig 8C ) . Nevertheless , this analysis defined the upper boundary for MitMAB administration in vivo . Based on these assessments , the effect of MitMAB at 10 mg / kg / day on tumor growth was tested ( experimental setup shown in Fig 8D ) . However , as seen in Fig 8E and 8F , no detectable effect of dynamin inhibition on the subcutaneous tumor growth or animal survival was seen under these conditions . Hence , MitMAB has a potent , but highly context - dependent , cytotoxic effect on leukemia and lym - phoma cells . Discussion In this study we investigated the effects of dynamin inhibition on leukemia and lymphoma cells . Our results show that dynamin inhibition is highly cytotoxic to CCRF - CEM and THP - 1 pediatric leukemia cells , which represent rapidly growing cells . In contrast , we observed no inhibiting effect on the viability of bone marrow cells from leukemia patients . However , these thawed bone marrow cells exhibit a comparatively high degree of spontaneous cell death , and are largely non - proliferating and thereby metabolically relatively inactive . Hence , we favor the notion that dynamin inhibition preferentially impacts on proliferating cells . Notably though , previous investigations have suggested that dynamin inhibition can have an impact on cells with both low and high proliferative capacity [ 16 ] . Nevertheless , we here provide data on the effect of dynamin inhibition on non - adherent cancer cells , which complements previous stud - ies where the focus has predominantly been on adherent cell lines [ 12 , 13 , 24 , 31 ] . Our findings PLOS ONE Dynamin and leukemia PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0256708 September 7 , 2021 12 / 19 reveal that dynamin inhibition induces potent caspase - dependent cell death through classical apoptosis . Previous studies have revealed a major function for dynamin in two cellular processes— endocytosis and during the abscission step in cytokinesis [ 11 ] . It is thus possible that the effect of dynamin inhibition on cancer cells can be explained by interference with either or both of these processes . Of these possible scenarios , previous studies have mainly proposed that the Fig 7 .

However , in this study we did not see any effect of dynamin inhibition on the progression through a specific cell cycle phase or checkpoint . This favors the notion that the cytotoxic effects on leukemia cells are independent of interference with cytokinesis , or any other discrete cell cycle event . In further agreement with this notion , dynamin inhibition caused only a partial blockade of EdU incorporation , suggesting minor effects on DNA synthe - sis . Possibly , these differences between the current study and earlier reports may lie in the nature of the studied cells , i . e . , that our study focused on non - adherent leukemia cells whereas previous studies focused predominantly on adherent , mostly epithelial - derived cancer cells . In addition , in hepatocellular carcinoma cells , Dynasore , but not Dyngo - 4a , was shown to affect the cell cycle distribution [ 31 ] , which points to cell type - dependent effects of at least some of the dynamin inhibitors . Although we did not see any effects of dynamin inhibition on the cell cycle progression , using either MitMAB or Dyngo - 4a at concentrations that effectively induce cell death of the leukemia cells , we cannot exclude that effects on the cell cycle ( e . g . , cytokine - sis ) could be seen at higher concentrations . Of note , we found that Dynasore , which was used at higher concentrations than both Dyngo - 4a and MitMAB ( to induce robust cell death ) , in fact caused a significant decrease of cells in the G2 / M phase . This may hint towards a partial block elsewhere in the cell cycle , but this effect was subtle ( < 2 - fold ) , even at the high concen - trations of dynamin inhibitor used . Based on the reasoning above , we propose that the cytotoxic effect of dynamin inhibition on leukemia cells is explained by interference with endocytosis , rather than with cell cycle con - trol . In this context , it is notable that observed effects on cell cycle progression in cultured cells do not necessarily reflect the mechanism of action in humans . An important example of the latter is the current controversy about the mechanism of action for paclitaxel in human patients , for which its efficacy as a treatment regimen might be less related to cell cycle inhibi - tion than originally proposed [ 32 ] . Here we show that MitMAB interferes with transferrin uptake , possibly leading to a shortage of iron . However , it is noteworthy that MitMAB at a concentration that profoundly impacted on cell viability ( 5 μ M ) caused only partial inhibition of transferrin uptake . This points to the involvement of also other endocytosis - related , or non - related , mechanisms in the induction of the cell death response . In line with this , it has recently been suggested that dynamin inhibition blocks ligand - bound receptor internalization in leukemia cells , leading to apoptosis [ 16 ] . Overall , it is reasonable to assume that highly proliferating cells such as the CCRF - CEM and THP - 1 cell lines have a high demand for endocytic processes , which could serve to supply the cells with nutrients or have a function in essential recycling / turnover of cell surface mole - cules such as various receptors . According to this scenario , it would be expected that relatively quiescent cells , such as the bone marrow cells used in this study , are resistant to the effects of dynamin inhibition , which indeed is in agreement with our findings . On the other hand , it cannot be excluded that the bone marrow samples contain a limited fraction of transformed cells , and that effects of MitMAB on transformed cell populations may to some extent have been masked by non - responding ( non - malignant ) cells present in the bone marrow aspirates . In further support for this scenario , we noted that human peripheral blood - derived mononu - clear cells were relatively unresponsive to dynamin inhibition . We also assessed whether dynamin inhibition could have an impact on tumor growth in a mouse model based on subcutaneous injections of suspension - growing EL4 lymphoma cells . However , the treatment did not prevent or delay the tumor growth , and did not alter the sur - vival of the treated mice vs . controls . The dynamin inhibitor used was well tolerated by the mice . Several reasons for the lack of efficacy of dynamin inhibition in this model can be envisioned . For example , we cannot be certain as to whether the dynamin inhibitor used is bioavailable at PLOS ONE Dynamin and leukemia PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0256708 September 7 , 2021 15 / 19 the site of tumor growth , and whether the drug actually penetrates into the tumor mass [ 33 , 34 ] . Furthermore , it remains possible that MitMAB partially or completely loses biological activity in the in vivo milieu . It should also be emphasized that we used a previously established subcutane - ous approach in this study , whereas a model based on intravenous administration of lymphoma cells might more closely reflect a setting of leukemia . Clearly , further in - depth investigations including pharmacokinetic assessments are thus needed to fully evaluate the possibility of using different dynamin inhibitors to dampen tumor growth across various in vivo models of leuke - mia and lymphoma ( see also [ 16 ] ) . Interestingly , it was previously shown that mutations in the gene for dynamin II ( DNM2 ) , are frequent in ALL patients , hence providing support for a role of dynamin - dependent mechanisms in leukemia development [ 35 ] . In summary , this study provides important insights into how dynamin inhibition can potentially be exploited for anti - leukemia purposes , but also indicates key challenges that may stand in the way of clinical translation .
