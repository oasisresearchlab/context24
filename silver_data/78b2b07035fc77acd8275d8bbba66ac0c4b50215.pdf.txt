Advances in Structural Biology and the Application to Biological Filament Systems David Popp , Fujiet Koh , Clement P . M . Scipion , Umesh Ghoshdastider , Akihiro Narita , Kenneth C . Holmes , and Robert C . Robinson * Structural biology has experienced several transformative technological advances in recent years . These include : development of extremely bright X - ray sources ( microfocus synchrotron beamlines and free electron lasers ) and the use of electrons to extend protein crystallography to ever decreasing crystal sizes ; and an increase in the resolution attainable by cryo - electron microscopy . Here we discuss the use of these techniques in general terms and highlight their application for biological filament systems , an area that is severely underrepresented in atomic resolution structures . We assemble a model of a capped tropomyosin - actin minifilament to demonstrate the utility of combining structures determined by different techniques . Finally , we survey the methods that attempt to transform high resolution structural biology into more physiological environments , such as the cell . Together these techniques promise a compelling decade for structural biology and , more importantly , they will provide exciting discoveries in understanding the designs and purposes of biological machines . 1 . Introduction Structural biology at atomic resolution is fundamental in understanding how the components of macromolecular machines generate biological processes . Through determining how the parts ﬁ t together and move relative to each other , and observing the architectures that de ﬁ ne how chemistry is achieved , high resolution structure determinations can be used to comprehend the designs of biological machines , revealing how and why they work . Structural biology came to the world ’ s attention in the 1950s with the X - ray ﬁ ber diffraction - based DNA double helix hypothesis [ 1 ] and the ﬁ rst X - ray crystallography structures of proteins , myoglobin , [ 2 ] and hemoglobin . [ 3 ] This led to the 1962 Nobel prizes being awarded to Crick , Watson , and Watkins ( Medicine ) and to Perutz and Kendrew ( Chemistry ) , but most importantly these studies demonstrated the importance of structure determination for understanding biology , through unlocking the genetic code and showing that protein architec - ture is key to biological function and chemistry . Celebrated discoveries have continued unabated , including the watershed publications of the structures of the ribosome [ 4 ] and the RNA polymerase , [ 5 ] both critical discoveries that propelled forward the understanding of the mechanics of these complex machines . Since then , there have been many outstanding successes in structural biology , however , in the ﬁ rst decade of this century the general perception of the structural biology began to decline for two reasons . Firstly , protein crystallography became easier and saturating with the advances in molecular biology , robotic crystallization screening , advanced synchrotron sources , phas - ing techniques , and crystallographic software . This rapid accumulation of new structures lowered the impact of each individual structure on the wider audience . Secondly , biology sometimes took a backseat to engineering in the early structural genomics efforts , where there was a focus on numbers and structural variety rather than on protein interactions and chemistry . [ 6 ] Moderate biological motivation at the inception led to moderate biological signi ﬁ cance revealed from the structures . The good news is that structural biology is ﬁ rmly back in the limelight with exciting transformative technologies , which promise a new decade of startling discoveries .

Samples that have problems with heterogeneity , availability , or have behavioral issues are often unsuitable for protein X - ray crystallography , traditionally the most widespread high resolution structural technique . Here we discuss the advances in the technologies that have transformed these uncooperative samples into targets that are now highly amenable to structure determination . 2 . Microcrystals – Small Becomes More Beautiful Proteincrystallographersoftenexperience thattheirmostexciting samplesdonotcrystallizeorformvanishinglysmallcrystals . There havetobethreenotablerecentadvancesinproteincrystallographythathaveaddressedstructuredeterminationfrommicrocrystals , something that would have been impossible on traditional synchrotron beamlines . Diffraction from a microcrystal relies on the balance between the crystal size , intensity of the source , backgroundscatterandradiationdamage . Thethreemethodshave solved this equation in different ways . Together these techniques address the structure determination for rare or uncooperative proteins that are only capable of forming microcrystals . 2 . 1 . Synchrotron X - Ray Microfocus Beamlines The ﬁ rst method toaddressmicrocrystalswastheintroduction of the synchrotron microfocus beamline . Synchrotron X - ray studies produce optimal diffraction data when the X - ray beam size matches the crystal size , through maximizing the diffraction from the crystal while minimizing background scatter , leading to a maximum in signal - to - noise . [ 7 ] Such microfocus beamlines are now widely available with typical minimum beam diameters of 1 – 10 μ m . [ 7 ] For reference , a 1 μ m cube crystal will contain millions of copies of a typical protein . However , data collection from even smaller crystals is possible from well - ordered strongly diffracting samples . The experiment usually involves scanning the sample with X - rays to locatethecrystalanddetermineitsoptimaldiffractionposition . Then partialdiffractiondatasetsarecollectedfromseveralcrystalsandlatermergedintoacompletedataset . This minimizes the radiation damagethatwouldbeincurredinmeasuringanentiredatasetfromasinglecrystal . [ 8 ] Alternatively , forneedle - shapedcrystalsthebeamcan be translated along the length of the needle during data collection to continuouslysupply unexposedregionsofthecrystal . Giventhehigh availability of microfocus beam time , this method can be routinely used structural biology laboratories with crystals that at are 1 – 10 μ m (cid:3) 1 – 10 μ m in cross section . 2 . 2 . X - Ray Free Electron Laser Secondly , the advent of the X - ray free electron laser ( XFEL ) provided an incredibly intense X - ray source in extremely short pulses ( femtoseconds ) . In the serial femtosecond crystallography ( SFX ) approach , [ 9 ] asinglediffractionimage isrecorded beforethe energy of the pulse destroys the crystal . [ 10 ] The pulsed operation modeofXFELallowsforcontinuoussamplingofamovingstream ofcrystals . Badimagesarethendiscarded , whilethousandsofgood diffraction images , each arising from a different crystal , are scaled intoacompletedataset . Inthisexperimentthediffractionimageis recorded before radiation damage occurs , maximizing the diffraction and signal - to - noise despite the high background scatter . [ 11 ] The technique has been typically applied to solving high resolution structures from (cid:4) 1 μ m crystals ( meaning that the crystals dimensions are at least 1 μ m in each axis ) , and to time - resolved structural studies . [ 12 ] A recent report has demonstrated that 2A ̊ diffraction data is possible from 0 . 25 μ m crystals , and 0 . 05 μ m crystals are theoretically amenable for structure determi - nation . [ 13 ] Thus , crystals in the 0 . 25 – 1 . 0 μ m range are optimal for data collection at XFEL beamlines and the technique is uniquely capableoffasttimeresolvedstudies , particularlyforlight - activated processes such as oxygen bond formation in photosystem II . [ 14 ] 2 . 3 . MicroED X - rays and electrons are scattered by atoms in different ways . X - rays interact with the electron cloud around an atom , however , the probability of a diffraction event is low . In X - ray diffraction , it is estimated that only one photon in a million interacting with the protein is scattered leading to low signal - to - noise and high radiation damage . [ 15 ] Electrons , by contrast , are scattered by their charge interaction with the charges on the protons and electrons of an atom and their probability of scatter is high . Thus , the attractiveness of electrons over X - rays is that there is less sample damage ( per diffraction event ) , by a factor of more than two orders of magnitude , [ 16 ] which allows for diffraction from smaller crystals than is possible from non - pulsed X - rays . Electron diffraction has been used as a method for protein structure determination for more than 40 years , [ 17 ] including the 3 . 5A ̊ structure of bacteriorhodopsin in 1990 , [ 18 ] which was recognized in award of the 2017 Nobel Prize . However , the routine implementation of electron crystallography suffered from two hurdles , which were solved in 2013 by the introduction of micro electron diffraction ( MicroED ) . [ 19 ] Firstly , the crystal size , electron dose and radiation damage were optimized . Large crystals ( greater than 3 μ m ) cannot be penetrated by the beam of a standard cryo - electron microscope , yet small crystals experi - ence too much radiation damage . Thus , the solution was to drastically reduce the electron dose and use crystals of a thickness of 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 μ m . [ 19 ] Secondly , data indexing was previously challenging from single images due to the large numbers of re ﬂ ections ( the large Ewald sphere ) at the wavelengths used in electron microscopy . At 200kV the wavelength is 0 . 025 A ̊ in contrast to the 1 A ̊ typically used in X - ray diffraction experiments . [ 20 ] This hurdle was removed by the use of low dose exposures that allow continuous crystal rotation exposures ( > 40 (cid:5) oscillations ) , which can then be indexed in standard X - ray crystallographic software . [ 19 , 21 ] The bene ﬁ ts of MicroED over SFX are that only a handful of crystals are required and that cryo - electron microscopy ( cryoEM ) instruments , which are available at many research centers , require a minor modi ﬁ cation to tilt the samples and conse - quently are likely to become widely available , as opposed to the XFEL for which it is notoriously dif ﬁ cult to obtain beamtime . [ 20 ] Together , microfocus beamlines , SFX and MicroED have www . advancedsciencenews . com www . bioessays - journal . com BioEssays 2018 , 40 , 1700213 1700213 ( 2 of 12 ) © 2018 The Authors . BioEssays Published by WILEY Periodicals , Inc . extended the minimal size of crystals suitable for structure determination , solving some of the problems posed by scarce and uncooperative proteins , however , they do not address samples that cannot be crystallized , such as the majority of biological ﬁ lament systems . 3 . Non - Crystalline Samples (cid:6) A Continuing Revolution in Resolution Thenumbersoftechniquesavailabletostudythesenon - crystalline samples are few . In the special cases of ﬁ lament systems , ﬁ ber diffraction studies and solid - state NMR spectroscopy have produced a limited number of high resolution structures , [ 22 , 23 ] however , thesereportsarerare . [ 24 ] Proteinstructuredetermination without the need for crystals was one of the initial goals of XFEL . TheintensityoftheXFELpulsesistheoreticallysuf ﬁ cienttocollect adiffractionpatternfromasinglemoleculebeforeitisdestroyedbyradiationdamage . [ 10 ] However , signal - to - noise levels in the diffraction patterns measured thus far have not proven suf ﬁ cient for high resolution structure determination . [ 24 ] Signi ﬁ cant advances , particularly in sample introduction methods , will be needed before the averaging of XFEL single molecule diffraction patterns will lead to high resolution electron density maps . By contrast , innovations in cryoEM have propelled it to be the dominant technique available for studying the structures of non - crystalline large protein assemblies . 3 . 1 . CryoEM Recent technological advancements in cryoEM have led to higher resolutions , and as a consequence , higher quality structures . This has taken cryoEM structural biology into the realms of near atomic resolution and , with it , recognition through the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing cryoEM to Jacques Dubochet , Joachim Frank , and Richard Henderson . A recent signi ﬁ cant technological advance was the advent of direct electron detectors ( DED ) , which have superior signal - to - noise resolution over charge - couple device ( CCD ) cameras , and have a data collection frame rate that allows for frames to be captured as a “ movie . ” Realignment of individual movie frames is used to account for beam - induced sample movement , damage , and grid drift , [ 25 ] factors that blurred earlier electron micrographs . Currently , high resolution cryoEM structural determinations are still subject to a few limitations . These include protein size ( larger structures are easier to identify and align ) , preference for samples with inherent symmetry , and high sample rigidity ( characteristics that allow averaging between identical units ) . However , the size and symmetry criteria are becoming relaxed , as evidenced by the 100kDa protein size “ barrier ” being broken with the determination of the structure of isocitrate dehydroge - nase , solved as a dimer with twofold symmetry at 3 . 8 A ̊ resolution . [ 26 ] In cryoEM individual images of molecules are selected and averaged into a composite electron density map . This allows relatively heterogeneous samples to be analyzed , such from a range of ribosome assembly intermediates . [ 27 ] Thus , the strength of cryoEM is the ability to elucidate structures from non - crystalline , non - homogeneous samples . While there is an encouraging growth in the number of cryoEM structures solved for samples without any inherent symmetry , symmetry in the sample improves the resolution of the ﬁ nal electron density maps by increasing the number of asymmetric units available for averaging . [ 28 ] Using data available in Electron Microscopy Data Bank ( EMBD ) from 2010 to 2017 , the average resolution of the top 10 % of all maps deposited has risen in the later half of that time period to a level that is typically acceptable in X - ray crystallography structures ( 3 A ̊ , Figure 1 ) . Furthermore , the highest resolution structures published each year continue to push the resolution boundaries ( Figure 1 ) . The numbers of cryoEM electron density maps deposited each year is increasing , as are the numbers of maps to 4 A ̊ or better deposited over the last 4 years , a resolution that allows for chain tracing ( Figure 2 A ) . Within the “ 4A ̊ or better ” set , approximately half of the maps are generated using symmetrical averaging ( Figure 2B ) . Prior to 2017 , the numbers of ribosomes or ribosomal complexes dominated the set of “ 4 A ̊ or better ” maps produced without symmetrical averaging ( 60 % , Figure 2C ) . This was due , in part , to the large size and rigidity of ribosomes making them excellent samples for cryoEM . A closer look at the high resolution maps generated using symmetrical averaging , reveals that prior to 2012 viruses accounted for most structures , due to their high symmetry , however , over the later years lower symmetry structures have become more prevalent , as the reliance on averaging from high symmetry became less essential due to improved data ( Figure 2D ) . Thus advances in cryoEM allow for near atomic resolution structures to be determined for proteins and protein complexes in solution . 4 .

It is important to note that helical ﬁ lament systems , such as actin , cannot generally pack together to adopt the symmetry needed to Figure 1 . Charting the improvement in resolution of EM maps .

BioEssays Published by WILEY Periodicals , Inc . build a crystal , ruling out the possibility of using X - ray crystallography to solve their structures . The ﬁ rst detailed model of the actin ﬁ lament ( 1990 ) was generated by ﬁ tting of the newly solvedX - raycrystalstructureoftheactinmonomerintoX - ray ﬁ ber diffraction data arising from aligned actin ﬁ laments collected on a CuK α rotating anode ( Figure 3 A ) . [ 29 , 30 ] The positioning of the monomer in the ﬁ lament was con ﬁ rmed later that year by the determination of a 25 – 30A ̊ resolution cryoEM map . [ 31 ] Manual positioning of the hydrophobic plug , in the original model ( Figure 3A ) , [ 29 ] proved to be anartifact introducedby anerroneous estimation of the ﬁ lament diameter from an assumed radius of gyration of 25A ̊ . The later higher resolution ﬁ ber diffraction structure [ 23 ] and 13 . 8A ̊ cryoEM [ 32 ] models reduced the radius of gyration to 23 . 7A ̊ , abrogating the need to extend the hydrophobic plug . In 2009 , higher resolution ﬁ ber diffraction data ( 3 . 3 – 5 . 6A ̊ ) were reported that were collected from superconducting - magnet aligned gelsolin - capped ﬁ laments using the SPring - 8 third generation synchrotron X - ray source . This allowed for re ﬁ nement of the protomer structure within the ﬁ lament , [ 23 ] and determined that there is a 20 (cid:5) rotation of the two domains of actin , ﬂ attening the G - actin structure on polymerization , and an ordering of the DNase I binding loop , [ 30 ] which is disordered in the native G - actin structure . [ 33 ] These features were con ﬁ rmed the following year from the 6 . 6A ̊ cryoEM F - actin structure , made possible by improvements to the electron microscope , including the intro - duction of a CCD camera and Ω - energy ﬁ lter . [ 34 ] The protein backbone and secondary structure could be unambiguously assignedwithintheelectrondensitymap . Directelectrondetectors improved the resolution to 3 . 7A ̊ ( 2015 ) , when the ﬁ lament was imaged as the tropomyosin actin complex , allowing visualization of some side chains ( Figure 3A ) , [ 35 ] with a furtherimprovement in 2016 to 3 . 6A ̊ , on data reprocessing . [ 36 ] Comparison of the original ﬁ ber diffraction model ( 1990 ) with the latest cryoEM model ( Figure 3A ) reveals that the placing the protomers within the ﬁ lament was largely correct , however , the 1990 model did not take account of the conformational changes within a protomer ( Figure 3B ) . These changes were revealed two decades later in the ﬁ ber diffraction ( 2009 ) and cryoEM ( 2010 ) models ( Figure 3Cand D ) . [ 29 , 34 ] Calculation of the ﬁ ber diffraction pattern from the latest cryoEM F - actin model with the original experimental data shows excellent correlation ( Figure 3E ) , demonstrating that ﬁ ber diffraction is an informative technique in ﬁ lamentstructuredetermination . However , samplepreparation of suitably aligned samples for ﬁ ber diffraction studies is non - trivial , [ 24 ] leaving cryoEM as the most practical method for determining high resolution ﬁ lament structures . 5 . Filament Structures : Recent Successes Theimplementation ofdirectelectrondetectorsincryoEMhas led to some stunning new structures over the last few years . These structures fall into three broad classes . The ﬁ rst class of ﬁ lament system structure determination belongs to the normal single particle reconstruction . The dynactin complex is an outstanding Figure 2 . Number of EM maps deposited in the EMDB during the present decade . Data accessed 03 / 01 / 2018 . A ) Total number of maps with respect to year .

BioEssays Published by WILEY Periodicals , Inc . example ( Figure 4 A and B ) of how a mini ﬁ lament system can be reconstructed from single particles . [ 37 ] The dynactin mini ﬁ lament is constructed from ten actin - like protomers – eight protomers of the actin - related protein 1 ( Arp1 ) , one protomer of actin - related protein11 ( Arp11 ) , andoneprotomerofactin . Thismini ﬁ lamentis cappedateachend . Atthebarbedend , twoArp1protomersinteract with cappingprotein ( CapZ ) , which isusuallyfoundcappingactin ﬁ laments . By contrast , at the pointed end , there is a capping complex ( p25 , p27 , p62 ) thatisuniquetothedynactin ﬁ lamentand interacts with one copy each of Arp1 and Arp11 . The shoulder complex ( p150 Glued , p50 , p24 ) bindstothesideofthemini ﬁ lament and extends out four shoulder peptides that interact with the each of the Arp1 subunits . Together the “ shoulder ” and capping complexesspecifythecompositionandlengthofthemini ﬁ lament , through interacting with each of the ﬁ lament protomers . The shoulderalso integratesp150 Glued , ﬁ rmly attaching itto the side of mini ﬁ lament . Together , this allows p150 Glued to link the cargo - binding dynactin ﬁ lament to the microtubule motor , dynein to produce transport of large cargos , such as organelles and vesicles . The second class of ﬁ lament reconstruction is that of isolated extended ﬁ laments . In this case , short segments within the ﬁ lament , which contain multiple protomers ( usually more than 10 ) , aretreatedinitiallyassingleparticles . After3Dreconstruction , theaveragingisextendedtotreateachprotomerasasingleparticle allowingforextensiveaveragingwithinandbetweenthe ﬁ laments . The aforementioned tropomyosin : actin copolymer exempli ﬁ es this method of reconstruction ( Figure 4C ) . The ﬁ nal class of ﬁ lament reconstruction is where the ﬁ lament system is saturated with a binding partner , such as myosin ( Figure 4D ) . Here , the innate symmetry of the ﬁ lament is exploited for averaging to produceahighresolutionimageoftheinteractionbetweenthetwoproteins , and to reveal the structure of the binding partner . Comparison of the core ﬁ lament structures from the actin : tropomyosin and dynactin complexes gives the impression that ﬁ lament systems constructed from the actin fold are highly conserved ( Figure 5 A and B ) . This is certainly true within eukaryotes , however , far greater variety can be found in the prokaryotic world . [ 38 ] For example , the ParM ﬁ lament that segregates the R1 plasmid forms a parallel left - handed helical ﬁ lament , [ 39 ] rather than right - handed architecture observed for actin ( Figure 5B and C ) . Furthermore , MreB forms antiparallel untwisted ﬁ laments , which when analyzed by protein Figure 3 . Evolution of resolution for the actin filament .

BioEssays Published by WILEY Periodicals , Inc . crystallography , were seen to form proto ﬁ laments within the crystal packing . [ 40 ] These designs are likely to represent just a fraction of the total ﬁ lament architectures formed from the actin fold . Negative stain EM data point to other designs that are comprised of four ﬁ laments arranged as closed or open tubules , [ 41 ] thus we expect the wider application of high resolution cryoEM to uncover many more architectures . 6 . Structure Versus Chemistry : Resolution Is Critical Anoft - posedquestioniswhetherresolutionisdirectlycomparable between CryoEM and X - ray crystallography . There is an issue in that standardization in the methods used to calculate resolution has yet to be fully implemented in the EM ﬁ eld , with different research groups using different metrics , something that has been normalized in the X - ray ﬁ eld for many years . The truest test of resolution is to directly compare electron density maps . The electron density maps at various resolutions can be seen to be essentially equivalent across a range of X - ray and cryoEM structures ( Figure 6 ) . At 4 . 3A ̊ the protein backbone is usually wellde ﬁ ned butsidechainsoftenhave poor density ( Figure 6Fand I ) . At 3 . 5 – 3 . 6A ̊ the sidechains become more visible ( Figure 6C , G , and H ) . At resolutions beyond 2 . 5A ̊ , sidechains orientations become reliable and water molecules can be identi ﬁ ed ( Figure 6A , B , D , E , andJ ) . Thus at resolutions around 4A ̊ the general fold of a Figure 5 . Comparison of actin - like filaments from cryoEM . Dynactin – the core dynactin filament taken from the 4 . 0A ̊ dynactin complex .

BioEssays Published by WILEY Periodicals , Inc . protein can be determined , but it is only when the resolution exceeds2 . 5A ̊ that thestructurescanbedeterminedwithsuf ﬁ cient accuracy to understand the chemistry . Genuine atomic resolution occurs at resolutions better than (cid:4) 1A ̊ . Clearly , the highest resolution cryoEM structures are now able to reveal chemistry ( Figure 1A ) , however , the publication of cryoEM structures has no ruleswithrespecttominimumresolution , placingtheonusonthe reader to decipher the quality of the structure . Currently , X - ray crystallography structures are not normally published unless the resolution at least reaches 3A ̊ , a level that is rather stringent . 7 . Dynamic Structures Exposure of proteins to intense X - rays or electrons leads to reaction with free radicals generated from the surrounding solvent and breakage or rearrangement of bonds . [ 42 ] These effects are minimized by freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen or helium in many of the techniques discussed above , and as such damage is not applicable in the femtosecond exposures of the XFEL SFX approach . [ 10 , 43 ] However , one consequence of immobilizing samples , by freezing or trapping within crystals , is that the structural range of dynamic cellular processes , such as polymerization , DNA segregation , protein recycling by chaper - ons or motility of motor proteins , can only be inferred from de ﬁ ned transient states . Currently , the organization of dynamic cellular processes are visualized at the single molecule level using classical ﬂ uorescence microscopy , such as confocal microscopy , that has a resolution limit of (cid:7) 200nm , much larger than the sub - nanometer resolution necessary for high resolution detection of these processes . The new “ super resolution microscopes ” have a resolution of up to 20nm ( 200A ̊ ) and require sample ﬁ xation . [ 44 ] Here “ super ” is a relative term that is compared to classical light microscopy , but it lags two - orders of magnitude behind the near atomic resolution structural biology techniques discussed above . Thus , advances are needed to address protein dynamics at high resolution . 7 . 1 . Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) AFM has found many applications since its introduction , [ 45 ] with recent developments including a high - speed AFM ( HS - AFM ) , whichhasbeenusedtovisualizemovementsandstructuralchangesinchaperonsinrealtime . [ 46 ] Arecentlydevelopedtip - scanAFMwas able to visualize tropomyosin ( diameter 20A ̊ ) with a temporal resolution of 10s per frame . [ 47 ] Thus , the AFM - based techniques promise to answer some of the outstanding questions concerning dynamic biological systems in real time at a comparatively high resolution ( 20 – 30A ̊ ) . EM has also been implemented in the liquid phase , with acrosomal actin bundle being imaged at 27A ̊ . [ 48 ] However , the applications of wet EM may be limited due to the effects on dynamics from the energy of the electron beam . 8 . Physiological Structures – Imaging Within Cells The ultimate aim of structural biology is to determine the structural components within cells and to follow their changes in various physiological processes . 8 . 1 .

[ 49 ] Individual components within the tomogram ( e . g . , actin ﬁ laments , microtubules , or ribosomes ) can be extracted and averaged to obtain medium - to - high resolution structures ( sub - tomogram averaging ) . Newly developed phase plates further increase image contrast , making it easier to identify cellular components within cells . [ 50 ] In vitro cryoET structures have been determined at medium resolution ( 8 – 9 A ̊ ) for structures with high symmetry like GroEL [ 51 ] and the HIV capsid in the intact virus . [ 52 ] Thus , using sub - tomogram averaging [ 53 ] ( which is similar to single particle analysis in cryoEM ) cryoET has become a reliable method to study the macromolecular assemblies inside cells at 10 – 20A ̊ resolution , [ 54 ] and has been used to investigate the cytoskeleton in cellular processes like cell adhesion or mitosis , [ 55 ] and its morphology during interactions with viruses and parasites . [ 56 ] CryoET is limited by how far electrons can penetrate through a biological sample , (cid:7) 1 μ m , which was shown to be feasible for Ostreococcus tauri , the smallest eukaryotic cell . [ 57 ] In order to examine bulkierspecimensthesamplehastobethinned . Thiscanbeachieved bycryo - sectioning , however , eventhemostadvanced oscillatoryknife causes mechanical stress and deformation , resulting in loss of resolution . [ 58 ] Recently , focused ion beam scanning electron tomography ( FIB - cryoET ) has emerged as the new and superior method of sample thinning in cryoET . FIB - cryoET allows for the visualization of cellular structures like the endoplasmic reticulum , mitochondria , microtubules , and ribosomes in cells [ 59 ] and the intracellular organization of cells from embryos to adults in developing Caenorhabditis elegans . [ 60 ] FIB - cryoET combined with a phase plate has allowed the Golgi apparatus to be visualized within cells at unprecedented resolution and for the identi ﬁ cation of new components . [ 61 ] CryoEThasrecentlybeenappliedasadiagnostictool toidentifystructuraldifferencesinmicrotubulesbetweenhealthyanddiseasedstatesofclinicalsamplesofpatientswithprimaryciliarydyskinesia [ 62 ] or with invasive ovarian cancer . [ 63 ] Thus , cryoET is becominganinvaluabletooltostudytheinternalstructureofcells , in order to build realistic models of cellular machineries by docking higher resolution structure determined in vitro . ThefutureofEMimagingofbiologicalmoleculesmayfollowthe techniques that are being developed to image robust non - biological molecules , where one current trend is to decrease the electron energy to levels where the radiation damage is acceptable for imaging stable single moleculeslikegraphene at atomic resolution , without the need for averaging . [ 64 ] Low energy electrons when combined with holographic electron microscopy ( HEM ) , which retains the phase information without the use of lenses and thus minimizes distortion , has been used to image graphene at 2A ̊ resolution . [ 65 ] Signi ﬁ cant advances in sample introduction will be necessary to adapt these techniques to biological molecules . 9 . Hybrid Models : Combining Techniques The resolution of cryoEM maps can be limited by sample heterogeneity and the number of good images of a particle for averaging . In such cases , hybrid techniques can be useful in understanding the architecture of large complexes . A recent example isthemodelofthenucleoporecomplexcorecreatedby ﬁ ttingmultiple X - raycrystalstructuresofnucleoporinsintoan (cid:7) 20A ̊ cryoETmap . [ 66 ] Sample heterogeneity can arise from structures that are dynamic or forsamplesthatcancontainvariousnumbersofsubunits , something that is particularly true for ﬁ lament systems . A simple example of combining structures obtained by different techniques can be generated from the superimposition of the cryoEM structures of the dynactin complex , the tropomyosin / actin complex ( Figure 3 ) , and tropomodulin / actin crystal structures to provide a model of a capped tropomyosin / actinmini ﬁ lament ( Figure7 ) . Thismodelindicateshow cappingprotein ( CapZ ) andtropomyosinmayinteractattheendofan actin ﬁ lament ( Figure 7E – G ) . The model predicts that one side of the common beta sheet of capping protein , and particularly the alpha subunit , may have a likely interaction with tropomyosin ( Figure 7F and G ) . By contrast , the tropomyosin on the opposite side of actin appears to be distant to capping protein , with the end of thebetatentacleprovidingapotentialbindingsiteshouldthepositionoftropomyosinmoveacrossthesurfaceofactin . 10 . Conclusions Recentadvancesinstructuralbiologytechniquesaretransformingthelandscapeofwhatcanbeconsideredasreasonabletargetsforstructuredetermination . Microcrystals are now routinely used to reveal high resolution structures of rare or moderately well - behaved samples . However , it is the development of cryoEM that has most dramatically changed the perspective , with whole new classes of molecules , such as ﬁ lament systems , yielding their structures to this technique . Furthermore , cryoET techniques are quickly improving theresolutionofstructuresthatcanbeobservedwithincells . Thecosts of these new structural biology tools are signi ﬁ cant . Nonetheless , state - of - the - artcryoEMinstrumentsarearelativelyinexpensive , atless than1 % ofXFELs . Researchcentersarecurrentlyscramblingtoinstall highresolutioncryoEMinstruments , andoftenmultipleinstruments , with the current demand outstripping supply . Given this rapid expansion , it is foreseeable that we will have a thorough structural understanding of all cellular machines in the coming decade .
