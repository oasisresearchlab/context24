Südhof , December 28 , 2010 ( sent for review November 12 , 2010 ) C1q - like genes ( C1ql1 – C1ql4 ) encode small , secreted proteins that are expressed in differential patterns in the brain but whose recep - tors and functions remain unknown . BAI3 protein , in contrast , is a member of the cell - adhesion class of G protein - coupled receptors that are expressed at high levels in the brain but whose ligands have thus far escaped identi ﬁ cation . Using a biochemical ap - proach , we show that all four C1ql proteins bind to the extracel - lular thrombospondin - repeat domain of BAI3 with high af ﬁ nity , and that this binding is mediated by the globular C1q domains of the C1ql proteins . Moreover , we demonstrate that addition of submicromolar concentrations of C1ql proteins to cultured neu - rons causes a signi ﬁ cant decrease in synapse density , and that this decrease was prevented by simultaneous addition of the throm - bospondin - repeat fragment of BAI3 , which binds to C1ql proteins . Our data suggest that C1ql proteins are secreted signaling mole - cules that bind to BAI3 and act , at least in part , to regulate synapse formation and / or maintenance . A mong the G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , the cell - adhesion class of GPCRs is the second - largest subfamily , comprising 33 members ( 1 – 3 ) . Cell - adhesion – type GPCRs con - tain a relatively large N - terminal extracellular sequence that is composed of multiple independent domains and is linked to the typical seven - transmembrane region architecture of GPCRs . In all cell - adhesion – type GPCRs ( except GPR123 , which may not be a true member of this class ) , an autoproteolytic sequence known as the GPCR proteolysis site ( GPS ) is located N - terminal to the ﬁ rst transmembrane region ( 4 ) . Cell - adhesion GPCRs appear to be generally cleaved at the GPS , and , at least for those proteins in which this has been investigated , the two fragments of adhesion GPCRs produced by autoproteolysis do not separate , but rather remain noncovalently bound ( 4 – 6 ) . Adhesion GPCRs are evolutionarily conserved , and members of this class of GPCRs are found in arthropods and nematodes ( 7 , 8 ) . Although a direct ligand - dependent activation of any adhesion GPCR has not yet been demonstrated , genetic evidence in zebra ﬁ sh indicates that a member of this class of GPCRs functions as a true GPCR and mediates an intracellular signal transduction event ( 9 ) . Brain - speci ﬁ c angiogenesis inhibitor ( BAI ) proteins are cell - adhesion GPCRs that are encoded by three genes , BAI1 , BAI2 , and BAI3 . The extracellular sequences of BAI proteins are composed of an N - terminal CUB domain , ﬁ ve ( BAI1 ) or four ( BAI2 and BAI3 ) thrombospondin type 1 repeats , a hormone - binding domain , and the GPS ( 10 , 11 ) . RNA quanti ﬁ cation and in situ hybridization have indicated that in adult mice , BAI proteins are expressed primarily in the brain , with low - level ex - pression in other tissues ( 12 – 15 ) . The BAI1 gene , originally identi ﬁ ed in a screen for p53 - inducible genes , is thought to in - hibit neovascularization , a process required for tumor growth ( 10 , 13 , 16 – 19 ) . Human BAI1 expression is down - regulated in glioblastoma and is inversely correlated with neovascularization in colorectal and lung cancers , consistent with an antiangio - genesis function ( 20 – 22 ) . The antiangiogenic activity of BAI1 is thought to be mediated by a fragment of its N - terminal extra - cellular sequence , a fragment known as vasculostatin ( 17 , 23 , 24 ) . BAI2 and BAI3 expression are not p53 - inducible , but both proteins also act as inhibitors of angiogenesis ( 11 , 14 , 15 , 25 ) . Moreover , BAI1 functions as a surface receptor for phosphati - dylserine that is exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells , sug - gesting that BAI1 is an engulfment receptor that can initiate phagocytosis ( 26 ) . Consistent with a role in neovascularization and / or engulfment of apoptotic cells , systematic cancer genomics identi ﬁ ed all three BAI genes as targets of mutations in several types of cancer ( 27 ) . Thus , a wealth of evidence implicates BAI proteins in oncogenic transformation , neovascularization , and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells ; however , whether ( and if so , how ) BAI proteins function as GPCRs remains unclear . BAI proteins exhibit only limited sequence identity with each other ( e . g . , mouse BAI1 and BAI3 are 48 . 1 % identical ) , but are highly conserved evolutionarily ( e . g . , human and mouse BAI3 se - quences are 98 . 4 % identical ) . In mice , the largely brain - speci ﬁ c expression of BAI3 peaks during neonatal development but per - sists throughout adult life at lower levels ( 15 ) . Interestingly , two SNPs within the human BAI3 gene have been signi ﬁ cantly as - sociated with schizophrenia in genome - wide association studies ( 28 ) . An explanatory model for the development of schizophre - nia is that the disease is a consequence of aberrant brain devel - opment before symptoms become manifest ( 29 ) . The temporal and spatial BAI3 expression pattern is consistent with its role in a pathogenic process like schizophrenia . C1q - like ( C1ql ) proteins are small , secreted proteins of un - known function that are synthesized from four genes in mam - mals , expressed almost exclusively in brain similar to BAI proteins , and produced in differential patterns by speci ﬁ c types of neurons ( 30 , 31 ) . C1ql proteins belong to a large family of proteins containing a globular complement 1q ( gC1q ) domain that associates into homotrimers or heterotrimers ( 32 – 34 ) . Be - sides the eponymic C1q complement factor , the gC1q - domain protein family contains small signaling molecules containing short N - terminal sequences and a C - terminal gC1q domain ( e . g . , cerebellins , adiponectin , C1ql proteins ) , as well as larger pro - teins , including collagens containing C - terminal gC1q domains . C1ql proteins are composed of an N - terminal signal peptide followed by a short conserved sequence ( ∼ 15 residues ) with two closely spaced cysteine residues , a spacer ( 15 – 35 residues ) , a collagen - like sequence ( ∼ 50 residues ) , and a C - terminal gC1q domain ( ∼ 140 residues ) that accounts for approximately half of the total C1ql sequence ( 238 – 287 residues ) . Structurally , C1ql proteins resemble a combination of cerebellins and adiponectin , both of which contain C - terminal gC1q domains , but with either a short conserved N - terminal cysteine - rich sequence ( cerebellin ) or an N - terminal collagen - like sequence ( adiponectin ) ( 35 , 36 ) . Notably , in cerebellins , the N - terminal sequence multimerizes the C - terminal trimeric gC1q domains ( 37 ) ; this sequence likely does the same in C1ql proteins ( 31 ) . The present study was initiated to identify possible ligands for BAI3 , based on the hypothesis that the neuronal expression and structure of this cell - adhesion GPCR suggests a possible role in neuronal signaling . Using af ﬁ nity chromatography , we identi ﬁ ed C1ql proteins as BAI3 ligands and found that the presence of C1ql proteins causes a decrease in synapse numbers in cultured Author contributions : M .

Results Identi ﬁ cation of C1ql Proteins as BAI3 Ligands . We produced a recombinant Ig - fusion protein composed of the extracellular domains of BAI3 fused to the F c region of human IgG ( IgBAI3 - 3 ) , along with a control Ig - fusion protein composed of only the F c region ( IgC ; Figs . 1 A and B ) . We then used the Ig fusion proteins in af ﬁ nity chromatography experiments with mouse brain proteins extracted in 1 % Triton X - 100 . Proteins were bound in the presence of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + and then sequentially eluted with solutions containing 0 . 5 M or 1 M NaCl with Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + and ﬁ nally with a solution containing 1 M NaCl and EGTA to chelate the Ca 2 + ions . Two sequential fractions for each elution condition were analyzed by SDS / PAGE and silver staining ( Fig . 1 C ) . Multiple proteins were bound to BAI3 and eluted by chelation of Ca 2 + with EGTA . Mass spectroscopy analysis of these pro - teins showed that most proteins constituted abundant in - tracellular molecules , such as tubulin , actin , heat - shock proteins , and GAPDH , which are not likely to be true ligands . Only two bona ﬁ de extracellular proteins were identi ﬁ ed , C1ql2 and C1ql3 , with multiple peptides unequivocally assigned to both ( 24 peptides out of a total of 215 in two independent experiments ) . Four different C1ql isoforms are expressed in the mammal - ian brain with an identical domain structure , comprising an N - terminal short cysteine loop domain , a central collagen - like se - quence , and a C - terminal gC1q domain ( Fig . 2 A ) ( 30 , 31 ) . We expressed all four C1ql isoforms as HA - tagged proteins by trans - fection into HEK293 cells , puri ﬁ ed them from the culture medium by immunoaf ﬁ nity chromatography with immobilized anti - HA antibody , and examined the recombinant C1ql proteins by SDS / PAGE . Under reducing conditions in boiled samples , the C1ql proteins appeared slightly larger than expected with considerable heterogeneity , presumably due to differential glycosylation ( Fig . 2 B ) . However , whenweanalyzed thesame proteins bySDS / PAGE without reducing agents or boiling , none of the proteins migrated at their expected monomer size , and most exhibited a very high apparent molecular weight ( Fig . 2 B ) . In contrast , recombinant neurexin - 1 β protein composed of only the neurexin - 1 β extracel - lular sequences exhibited no difference in migration as a function A B C 200 11697 66 45 200 11697 66 45 31 I g BA I 3 - 3 I g C I g BA I 3 - 3 I g C I g BA I 3 - 3 I g C I g BA I 3 - 3 I g C I g BA I 3 - 3 I g C I g BA I 3 - 3 I g C I g BA I 3 - 3 I g C 0 . 5 M NaCl 1 M NaCl 1 M NaCl + EGTA Ig - protein Affinity Chromatography Fractions ( Silver Stain ) Coomassie SP TSRs 7 TMRs BAI3 N C CUB HB GPS 1 2 3 4 100 aa SP TSRs IgBAI3 - 3 N C CUB HB 1 2 3 4 F Ig SP IgC N C Ig kDa kDa * * * * Fig . 1 .

These ﬁ ndingssuggestthat C1ql proteins , similar to C1q complement factor , form higher - order multimers via their interactions within the gC1q domains and / or their collagenous and cysteine loop domains , as suggested previously ( 31 ) . We next incubated recombinant C1ql3 with BAI3 Ig - fusion protein ( IgBAI3 - 3 ) or with IgC control protein under various conditions , and measured the interactions by immunoprecipita - tion of C1ql3 via its HA epitope ( Fig . 2 C ) . We found that C1ql3 and IgBAI3 - 3 speci ﬁ cally interacted with each other , and that this interaction required divalent cations , most likely Ca 2 + given EGTA ’ s binding preference . To examine whether all four C1ql proteins bind to BAI3 , and to assess this binding with an independent assay , we measured the binding of C1ql proteins to HEK293 cells expressing full - length BAI3 ( Fig . 2 D ) . In this assay , mVenus - tagged BAI3 was expres - sed by transient transfection , and its localization to the plasma membrane was con ﬁ rmed by ﬂ uorescence microscopy . Puri ﬁ ed recombinant C1ql proteins ( Fig . 2 B ) were then added to the medium . Cells were washed , ﬁ xed , and analyzed for C1ql protein binding to the cell surface by indirect immuno ﬂ uorescence for the HA epitope included in the recombinant proteins without cell permeabilization . Recombinant HA - tagged neurexin - 1 β pro - tein served as a control . All four C1ql isoforms , but not the neurexin - 1 β extracellular domain , exhibited binding to BAI3 - expressing HEK293 cells , suggesting that all four C1ql proteins interact with BAI3 on the cell surface ( Fig . 2 D ) . No binding of C1ql proteins to cells that did not express BAI3 was observed . Measurement of Binding Af ﬁ nities . We next strove to determine the binding af ﬁ nities of the C1ql proteins for BAI3 . For this purpose , we ﬁ rst performed surface plasmon resonance experiments with recombinant full - length C1ql3 . We observed fast on - rates but slow off - rates , suggesting an overall dissociation constant ( K D ) of ∼ 10 nM ( Fig . 3 A ) . We con ﬁ rmed this estimate of the C1ql3 – BAI3 binding af ﬁ nity with a quantitative cell - surface binding assay in which we incubated HEK293 cells expressing BAI3 with different concentrations of C1ql3 , using mock - transfected cells as a con - trol . We then ﬁ xed the cells and quanti ﬁ ed the amount of bound C1ql3 on the surface using an HRP - coupled anti - HA antibody . Af ﬁ nities were calculated after subtraction of background binding observed with control cells . In ﬁ ve independent experiments , we observed an apparent dissociation constant of ∼ 4 nM for full - length C1ql3 and BAI3 , af ﬁ rming a high - af ﬁ nity interaction ( Fig . 3 B ) . It should be noted that the dissociation constant estimated by this method might underestimate the true binding af ﬁ nity , be - cause the assay also relies on the interaction between the HA epitope and the anti - HA antibody . To measure the af ﬁ nities of all C1ql proteins for BAI3 , we needed to produce suf ﬁ cient quantities of recombinant proteins , which proved dif ﬁ cult in transiently transfected HEK293 cells . Thus , based on studies of other gC1q domain proteins ( 32 – 34 ) , we speculated that the binding of C1ql proteins to BAI3 might be mediated by the gC1q domain . We produced the isolated gC1q domains of all C1ql proteins as HA - tagged recombinant proteins in bacteria by ﬁ rst generating GST - fusion proteins , and then cleaving off the C1ql moiety with thrombin ( Fig . 3 C ) . We then used the recombinant bacterial gC1q domains of the C1ql proteins for quantitative cell - surface binding assays ( Fig . 3 D ) . Strikingly , the bacterially produced gC1q domains of all C1ql proteins were speci ﬁ cally and saturably bound to BAI3 - expressing HEK293 cells . As determined in three independent experiments , the gC1q domains of C1ql1 , C1ql2 , and C1ql3 bound to BAI3 with low nanomolar af ﬁ nities ( K D = 1 . 3 – 2 . 1 nM ) , whereas the gC1q domain of C1ql4 exhibited an ∼ 10 - fold lower af ﬁ nity ( K D = 20 . 5 nM ) ( Fig . 3 D ) . Thus , all C1ql proteins are high - af ﬁ nity ligands for BAI3 . Characterization of Binding Domains .

To examine which of these sequences constitutes the binding site for C1ql proteins , we produced four BAI3 Ig - fusion proteins containing different ex - tracellular BAI3 domains ( Figs . 4 A and B ) . We then used these proteins in pull - down experiments with puri ﬁ ed C1ql3 protein . These experiments revealed that the thrombospondin repeats of BAI3 were both necessary and suf ﬁ cient to bind to C1ql3 ( Fig . 4 C ) . Given that thrombospondin repeats are known to adopt an autonomously folded , disul ﬁ de - bonded conformation composed of three β - strands ( 38 ) , it is possible that fewer than four thrombospondin repeats are required for binding . Effect of C1ql Proteins on Synapse Density . Because BAI3 and C1ql proteins are both expressed at high levels in neurons , and cer - ebellin - 1 — which is related to C1ql proteins — regulates synapse formation in the brain ( 39 , 40 ) , we hypothesized that C1ql pro - teins and BAI3 might have a function in synapses . As a ﬁ rst test of this hypothesis , we added to cultured hippocampal neurons at 10 d in vitro ( DIV10 ) increasing concentrations of recombinant bacterial C1ql3 protein ( composed of only the gC1q domain ) , and determined the density of excitatory and inhibitory synapses on pyramidal neuronal dendrites on DIV14 ( Fig . 5 ) . Synapse densities were measured by indirect immuno ﬂ uorescence with antibodies to excitatory ( vGlut1 , the vesicular glutamate trans - porter , and PSD95 , a postsynaptic density protein ) and inhibitory markers ( GAD65 , a 65 - kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase ) . Si - multaneously , we also quanti ﬁ ed morphological parameters of the neurons , including soma size , dendrite length , and dendritic branching ( Fig . 6 ) . As measured with staining for vGlut1 , C1ql3 concentrations as low as 0 . 2 μ M signi ﬁ cantly ( ∼ 40 % ) decreased the excitatory synapse density in cultured hippocampal neurons , with a maxi - mal decrease of ∼ 55 % obtained with 10 μ M C1ql3 ( Fig . 5 B ) . The decrease in excitatory synapse density was also detected by stain - ing excitatory synapses for PSD95 , whereas C1ql3 had no sta - tistically signi ﬁ cant effect on inhibitory synapse density except at high concentrations ( i . e . , 10 μ M ) . Strikingly , the effect of C1ql3 on synapse density was occluded by addition of an equimolar concentration of the recombinant BAI3 fragment that binds to C1ql3 ( IgBAI3 - 6 ) ( Fig . 5 ) . Examination of the other C1ql pro - teins indicated that they also decreased the density of synapses , with similar potencies . As a control , we measured the effects of C1ql3 applied at 1 μ M on the length and branching of dendrites in the cultured neurons , and found no signi ﬁ cant change ( Fig . 6 ) .

Discussion In a search for endogenous ligands for the cell - adhesion – type GPCR BAI3 , we have identi ﬁ ed C1ql proteins as endogenous BAI3 ligands . C1ql proteins are small , secreted proteins con - taining a gC1q domain preceded by two short multimerization sequences ( a cysteine loop motif and a collagen - like domain ; Fig . 2 A ) , whereas BAI3 is composed of a large extracellular sequence containing a CUB domain , four thrombospondin repeats , and a GPS sequence , followed by a typical GPCR architecture composed of seven transmembrane regions and a cytoplasmic C - terminal tail ( Fig . 1 A ) . We found that the gC1q domain of all four C1ql proteins binds to the thrombospondin repeats of BAI3 ( Figs . 2 – 4 ) . The high af ﬁ nity of this binding ( K D = 1 – 20 nM ) , along with the nature of C1ql proteins as small secreted proteins and of BAI3 as a membrane - bound GPCR , suggest that BAI3 is a genuine receptor for C1ql proteins in the brain . Both C1ql and BAI3 proteins are expressed in adult animals almost exclusively in the brain and appear to be enriched in neurons ( 11 , 12 , 31 ) . Strikingly , the addition of the recombinant gC1q domains of C1ql proteins to the medium of cultured hip - pocampal neurons caused signi ﬁ cant decreases in synapse density without affecting other measured morphological parameters ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) . This effect was observed for all four C1ql proteins and was blocked in the case of C1ql3 by the addition of the recombinant thrombospondin repeats of BAI3 ( Fig . 5 ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest that C1ql proteins regulate synapses and thus are functionally analogous to cerebellins , which are homologous to C1ql proteins , have a well - documented function in synapse for - mation , and bind to the orphan glutamate receptor δ 2 ( 39 , 40 ) . In summary , our data indicate that C1ql proteins represent a family of signaling molecules , analogous to cerebellins ( 39 , 40 ) and adiponectin ( 36 , 41 , 42 ) , and that they act , at least in part , by binding to BAI3 as a receptor . Our study raises many additional questions , however . Whether C1ql proteins actually activate BAI3 as a GPCR to initiate an intracellular signaling cascade is unclear . One possibility is that C1ql proteins , as large multimers , link multiple BAI3 molecules into complexes , thereby activating them . Moreover , our experiments do not demonstrate whether C1ql proteins decrease synapse density through a direct effect on synapse formation , on synapse stability , or on other properties of the neurons . This question remains to be addressed in future experiments . Furthermore , although the BAI3 fragment binding to C1ql3 blocked the effect of C1ql3 on synapse density , it is possible that C1ql3 decreases synapse density by binding to a protein other than BAI3 on the neuronal surface . Nonetheless , the high af ﬁ nity and speci ﬁ city of C1ql protein binding to BAI3 , along with the strong expression of BAI3 in pyramidal hippo - campal neurons ( 15 ) , strongly support the notion that their in - teraction underlies the effect of C1ql proteins on synapse density . Finally , some basic questions — such as that of the lo - calization of BAI3 — also remain to be addressed . These ques - tions are dif ﬁ cult to answer without either overexpressing tagged proteins , which often gives erroneous results , or generating outstanding antibodies to the endogenous protein , which is often dif ﬁ cult . Thus , our study is an initial exploration of C1ql and BAI3 proteins that suggests an unexpected relationship between these fascinating molecules and raises the possibility that to - gether they might regulate synapses , and that the association of human BAI3 S NPs with schizophrenia ( 28 ) may re ﬂ ect , at least in part , aberrant synapse formation and / or maintenance in the carriers of these mutations . Our work here will hopefully initiate future studies investigating a potential association between C1ql mutations and schizophrenia . Materials and Methods Antibodies .

GST - fusion proteins expressed in bacteria and Flag - tagged or Ig - fusion proteins expressed in transfected HEK293 cells were purifed essentially as described previously using glutathione agarose ( 44 ) or anti - Flag or protein A - Sepharose af ﬁ nity columns ( 43 ) . SDS / PAGE and im - munblot analysis were performed using standard methods . For pull - down assays and af ﬁ nity chromatography experiments , brain proteins solubilized in 20 mM Hepes - NaOH ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 0 . 1 M NaCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM EGTA , and protease inhibitors were used in standard procedures ( 45 ) , and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS / PAGE , visualized by silver staining , and identi ﬁ ed by mass spectrometry at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry Facility . To test the binding of C1ql3 to various BAI3 Ig - fusion proteins , HA - tagged C1ql3 attached to anti - HA agarose was incubated with BAI3 Ig - fusion proteins [ either puri ﬁ ed proteins in 10 mM Hepes - NaOH ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 0 . 15 M NaCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , and 2 mM MgCl 2 or medium from transfected HEK293 cells ] overnight at 4 °C under agitation . Beads were washed , boiled for 4 min in SDS sample buffer , and analyzed by SDS / PAGE and immunoblot analysis . Cell - Surface Assays . Cell - surface labeling assays were performed as des - cribed previously ( 46 ) . For cell - surface binding af ﬁ nity determinations , BAI3 - transfected HEK293 cells were incubated with HA - tagged ligands [ in DMEM containing 50 mM Hepes - NaOH ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 0 . 1 % BSA , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 ] in a serial dilution ( typically 11 dilutions : 400 nM , 200 nM , 100 nM , A C B D 1 . 5 C1ql3 Δ N ( 1 μ M ) Control S o m a A r ea [ μ m 2 ] 300 200 100 0 3 2 1 0 40 30 20 10 0 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 D end r i t e s / C e ll B r an c he s / C e ll C1ql3 Δ N ( 1 μ M ) Control C1ql3 Δ N ( 1 μ M ) Control C1ql3 Δ N ( 1 μ M ) Control 4 T o t a l D end r i t e Leng t h / C e ll [ mm ] Fig . 6 .

Cells were washed , ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min on ice , washed with PBS , and incubated in blocking solution ( 3 % BSA in PBS ) for 30 min at room temperature . Peroxidase - conjugated anti - HA antibodies ( diluted 1 : 50 , 000 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) were added in blocking solution for 60 min . After washing with PBS , cells were incubated in TMB peroxidase EIA substrate solution ( Bio - Rad ) for 5 – 20 min under vigorous agitation . The re - action was stopped with an equal volume of 1N sulphuric acid , and absor - bance at 450 nm was measured in a 96 - well plate using an Apollo - 8 LB912 plate reader ( Berthold Technologies ) . The ligand concentration was plotted versus the absorbance difference between transfected and mock - trans - fected cells , and the K D value was calculated using Scatchard analysis . Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis . Binding of C1ql3 to IgBAI3 - 3 was mea - sured on a Biacore 3000 system . IgBAI3 - 3 was covalently bound to the car - boxymethylateddextranmatrixofaresearch - gradeCM5biosensorchipusing EDC / NHS amine - coupling chemistry . A separate reference surface contained IgC protein . C1ql3 was diluted in running buffer [ 107 mM Hepes - NaOH ( pH 7 . 1 ) , 89 mM glycine , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 ] , and injected over the two surfaces at different concentrations with a ﬂ ow rate of 30 μ L / min at 10 °C . The injection interval was 180 s , followed by a decay interval of 400 s in which running buffer alone was run through the surface . The surfaces were regenerated by two 30 - s injections of a regeneration solution [ 107 mM Hepes - NaOH ( pH 7 . 1 ) , 89 mM glycine , 5 mM EGTA ] . Reference data were subtracted from the sample ﬂ ow channel to obtain speci ﬁ c C1ql3 binding . Neuronal Culture Experiments . Primary hippocampal neurons were cultured from newborn mice . Neurons were dissociated by papain treatment ( 20 min at 37 °C ) , triturated , plated onto coverslips coated with Matrigel ( BD Bio - sciences ) in 24 - well plates and cultured in MEM ( Gibco ) , 5 g / L of glucose , 100 mg / L of transferrin , 200 mg / L of NaHCO 3 , 0 . 5 mM L - glutamine , 5 % FBS , 2 % B - 27 supplement , and 2 μ M cytosine arabinoside . Puri ﬁ ed C1ql proteins were added at the indicated concentrations , either alone or together with IgBAI3 - 6 , to the cultured neurons on DIV10 , and neurons were analyzed on DIV14 by double - immuno ﬂ uorescence staining using methanol ﬁ xation for vGlut1 , GAD65 , and MAP2 or ﬁ xation in cold 4 % paraformaldehyde / 2 % sucrose for PSD95 and MAP2 . Images were acquired with a Leica TCS2 confocal micro - scope and analyzed with MetaMorph software ( Molecular Devices ) . For each independent experiment , the ﬁ rst ∼ 50 μ m of a basal dendrite ( starting from the soma ) from 15 pyramidal neurons were imaged , and synapse densities were averaged . The calculations shown in Fig . 6 were performed using the MetaMorph neurite analysis application . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . We thank Dr .
