THE NATURE AND FUNCTION OF THE PATENT SYSTEM * EDMUND W . KITCH The University of Chicago Law School THIS essay argues that the patent system performs a function not previ ously noted : ' to increase the output from resources used for technological innovation . Recognition of this function makes it no longer possible to main . tain tbat the patent inevitably reduces the output of the technology it sub jects to exclusive control , but it does make more understandable what have heretofore been puzzling features of the patent system and reintegrates the patent institution with the general theory of property rights . These ideas first crystallized in response to Barze ! ' s essay , " The Optimal Timing of Innovations , ' " where he points out that the exploitation of techno logical information has much in common with fisheries , pUblic roads , and oil and water pools - all resources not subject to exclusive control . If the rule of first appropriation controls , there will be an inefficiently rapid depletion of the resource . Barzel suggested this problem could be solved if technological monopoly claims could be granted or auctioned off , giving their owner the exclusive right to develop the technological opportunity .

S a more . senslble system than an auction system would be . ' In bnef , the view of the patent system offered here conceives of the process of technological innovation as one in which resources are brought to be ~ : ~ pon an array of prospects , each with its own associated sets of prob abIlIties of costs and returns . By a prospect I mean a particular opportunity ' to develop a known technological possibility . Each prospect can be pursued by any number of firms . . Not only can any . Jevel of resources be used to develop the prospect , but the activities of anyone firm need not be disclosed to the others . This process can be undertaken efficiently only if there is a system that tends to . assure efficie . nt allocation of the resources among the prospects at a ~ ~ fficlent rate and In an efficient amount ; if management of ~ ach prospect IS In the hands of the entity best equipped to manage it ; ani : ! if Info : matIon found by one entity is communicated to other firms at an effiCIent r . ate . The patent system achieves these ends by awarding exclusive and pubhcly recorded ownership of a prospect shortly after its discovery The patent system so viewed is closely analogous to the Ame ; icaiI minerai claIm system for ~ ublic lands . Forexpositional convenience , ihisviewof the patent system Will be called the prospect theory . ' . . The conventional view of the patent system as a device that enables an . Inventor to capture the returns from his investment in the invention will ' be called the rew ~ r ~ theoty . The reward theory is not questioned on its own terms . Rath ~ r , It IS argued ·that the reward theory offers an incomplete view of the functions of the patent system . Econ ~ mists ~ ormulated and extensively discussed their view of the patent syste ~ In the mneteenth century . 5 The occasional discussions found in cur rent hterature ~ re all based upon the conceptual , structure developed then although there IS wide variation in judgments about the costs and benefits of . the system . Th . e ~ atent is a reward that enables the inventor to capture the returns from hIS Investment in the invention , retutns that would oth ~ rwise ( absent secrecy ) be subject to appropriation py others . . The existence of the reward tends to make the amount of private investment . i11 1nvention closer to the value of its social product . To quote Pigou : " The patent laws aim in effect , at bringing marginal trade , net product , and ' marginal social ~ et . ~ roduct more closely together : ' " Offsetting this benefit of the patent system IS the fact that the patent subjects new technology to exclusive control and . , .

The first section explores < how the structure of the patent system causes It to work as a prospect ·system . The second section , for purposes of expositional clarity and later policy atgument , develops a detailed institutional analogy between patents ' , " and mineral claims as they developed in the American West . The third ' : section explains how the patent system , when viewed as performing both ; ~ ' prospect and reward functions , enhances public welfare . The fourth section " explores how consideration of the prospect function relates to a number of ! ' central questions of patent policy . 1 . PATENTS AS PROSPECTS ; " ~ ; ~ ThisseCtion simultaneously argues three separate points , First , any patent " system will have some prospect elements . 7 Second , the rules of a patent system can be adjusted so as to make the prospect function important . ' Third , the prospect function is a significant , if not the predominate , function ' of the American patent system as it has operated in fact . 8 The . argument ocuses onth ~ third point both because it encompasses and illustrates the t two and because it is the most difficult to sustain . The difficulty of . . , making authoritative statements about the effects of a system as complex as , jf ; the patent system is further complicated by the fact that the American patent . " E $ Ystem . has changed over time . For instance , much of the antitrust law , " . · ' ·designed to confine the operation of the patent system to its " proper sphere " ; j , ' i ' ; ; > has been implicitly based upon the reward theory and may have affected the " " ; : ' j . ' ability of the system to perform the prospect function . Consequently , the . ' pre - antitrust , nineteenth - century patent system was probably more of a ' prospect system than the twentieth - century system has been . . . The importance oithe prospect function in the American patent system is : , . argued from three . features of the system : The first is the scope accorded to ' , ·r , : ' t : patent claims , a scope that reaches well beyond what the reward function " . ' \ ' ; ; , ; , would require . Second , there are rules , such as the priority , time - bar , and ' ~ : < " " patentability rules , which force an early patent application whether or not . something of value ( and hence a reward ) has . been found . AiId third , there is . . y . . " the fact that many technologically important patents have been issued long ; " · / ; 1 ~ ; ' ~ 1 ; . before commercial exploitation became possible .

My casual impression is that the features central to the argument are also found in the other major patent systems ; 9 The first becausethe patent exceeds the contribution of the inventor ; the second because the J : hoice of the patentee does n ' ot take into account the quality of his contribution , which may be less than that ofthe unsuccessful claimants ; and the third because the patent may expire before the invention is worth ve , ry much . . . . 1 . 0 35 u . s . c . § 112 ; Edmund W .

' • We tend to think of an invention as the thing an invehtor has made oraccomplished , and the rule seems to imply the inventor is confined to that . But the rule is misleading , because the invention as claimed in the patent claims and the physical embodiment of the invention are two quite different things . . " A claim is an abstraction and generalization of an indefinitely large number of concrete , physical objects . " " Thus to illustrate from a nineteenth - century case , an inventor could claim a process . ofseparating fats into glycerine and stearic , margaric and oleic acids through the use of heat , pressure , and water at any temperature and in any apparatus that would W9 rk . 12 This is so even though the inventor himself had used . only a few of the possible . combinations that would work . Such a claim would COver the use of machinery later developed to carry out the process , even if that machipery were far superior to the first inventor ' s . To further iIlusti < ite the point , an inventor who is the first to combine an internal combustion engine with a drive train , wheels , and a steering mech - . anism may claim the combination ( as Selden 13 did in his controversial pat ent ) although the particular combination is so slow and unreliable under actual conditions of use that horse - drawn vehicles are commercially superior . Subsequent inventors of superior automobiles will infringe that claim , even if theircontributions to the design of automobiles are what , in fact , made them commercially practicable . The inventor ofa proCess of making copies by exploiting the interaction between metallic particles and magnetic fields can claim that process ( as Carlson , the inventor ofxerography did ) , 14 even though he is able to practice I \ \ 269 .

Although he has no absolute right to the patent , he can be dislodged by the second to file ( the " junior " party ) only if the junior files not later than one year after the senior patent issues and can prove that he is the first inventor . This proof must be by the preponderance of the evidence , or if the junior party files after the senior party ' s patent has ·issued , beyond a reasonable doubt . The rules for establishing·priorinventor ship are quite demanding ' and rather metaphysical . l9 In addition , there are " time - bar " rules that make a pateht invalid if the application is filed more than one year after a commercial use , or after a ' publication describing the invention . Since the commercial use or publica tion may be by others , the bar is not . within the inventor ' s control . And any move by him to make commercial use of the invention - for instance , a contract to sell output from a newly invented process - will activate the time bar . to .

" The combined effect of these rules is that whenever a technological inno vation has been discovered , it is risky not to immediately seek a patent . even though the practical significance of the innovation may be but dimly perceived . Indeed , ifthe actual first discoverer is tardy , he may find someone else has the patent and he is not entitled to use his own discovery .

If his claims exceed his invention , they are ' invalid . , 5 . The mineral claim system has rules designed to eliminate claims that prove unpromising and return them to the public domain . In order to keep a mineral claim in force , the owner must each year perform a certain amount of work on the claim . 29 If his evaluation of the value of the claim is less than the expense of this work , he will , abandon it . This function is performed in the American patent system by the limited term and in other systems by ' additional requirements for maintenance payments . 6 . The interests in a mineral claim can be transferred , both hefore and after the rights to the claim are established . The same rule applies in the patent system . o . ne of the functions of the miIleral claim system on the public lands of the West was to create incentives for prospectors to pack their burros and walk off into the desert in search of mineralization . It is misleading to suggest , however " that this was the only , or indeed the principal , function of the system . Although the existence of the system tended to generate the socially optimum level of investment in pro ~ pecting , most would agree it is erroneous to suggest that its effect was to reduce the mineral output from , lands made subject to exclusive ownership as the result of its operation , This 1amiliarresult ' rh the mining case is offered not as proof that the results of the patent system are the same , but as an analogy to assist the reader unfamiliar with the patent system in thinking about the prospect function . The mining case is usually seen . as one with a horizontal demand ' curve for the mineral output - the standard competitive case . This model makes the efficiency results easy to see since there is no problem of monopoly constraint on production . Conversely , the patent case is always , visualized as one of a demand curve with a negative slope and its attendant monopoly effects . In fact , the demand conditions faced by particular mines and par ticular , patents vary widely . Demand conditions will depend uponthe rela tionship of a mine ' s output to the total market supply , the market being defined in a way that ' takes into account the ore quality , mining cost , and geographic location of a mine . Many patents face competition from other processes or products . The question of whether the gains from unified con trol are greater than or less than the losses caused by the ability of the controlling entity to exercise market power is a question that could be exam ined in the case of each individual mine and each indiVidual patent . A rule that changed the property rights in each individual case where the balance was adverse to society would entail heavy administrative costs and , because it would cast uncertainty over the ownership rights of the successful _ and ' I I 1 I I " 275 THE PATENT SYSTEM , 1 ' . . . es ' would significantly undermine the ' hence economIcally , mpo ~ ant - cas ' I b th cases the effect of the prop - , • . f th property right system . n o . . th d •functions 0 e , , b s ed without exam , mng e e - ' . hts oc , ' al ' welfare cannot e asse s , . th • erty rIg on s f ' th ri hts and assessmg e , , ' d conditions actually faced by owners 0 e g , . · : ~ ut increasing efficiency effects of the property system .

VI ' LAW ANDl : ~ CONOM1CS resources that may be employed to Use information , and it is that scarcity which generates the need for a system of property rights in information . The advantages of the patent system are as follows . . First , a patent " pr ~ spect " increases the efficiency with which investment in innovation can be managed . As already noted , Barzel pointed out that technological information is a resource which will not be efficiently used absent exclusive ownership . Barzel concentrated on thetime dimension , but the result is well known and applies ' to all dimensions of ·the imrestment process . But unlike fisheries , public roads , and the other types of goods usually considered , technological information can be used without signaling ' . that fact to another . Fishing boats can be detected , and one who is considering entry can take into account the magnitude oEhis competitor ' s activities . And if the fishery is depleted , that fact is likely to be immediately telegraphed by the absence of working boats . Butin the area of technological innovation , it is possible for a firm working in secrecy to enter upon a " prospect , " investigate it extensively , and depart without a trace , Subse - · quent investigation of tbesame prospect by other firms can neither build on the knowledge obtained by the first searcher nor determine the efficient level and strategy of search based upon his failure . Thus the potential gains from exclusive ownership are particularly large . No one is likely to rIlake sig nificant investments s ~ ar ~ hing for ways to increase the commercial value of a patent unless he has made previous arrangements with the owner of the patent . This puts the pa . tent owner in a position to coordinate the search for technological and market enhancement of the patent ' s value so that duplica ~ tive investments are not made and so that information is exchanged among the searchers . . Second , the patent owner has an incentive to make investments· to maximize the value of the patent without fear that the fruits of the invest ment will produce unpatentable information appropriable by competitors . . Th·is is important only if the development of patented inventions generally requires significant investments that lead to unpatented information a com petitor can appropriate . Expenditures for such things as manufacturing plants that cannot be a . ppropriated under basic property concepts by com petitors need not concern us . In the case of many patents , extensive devel opment is required before any commercial application is possible - for ex ample the laser , the transistor , nylon , and xerography . The investments inay be . required simply to apply existing technology to the manufacture and design of the product and be so mechanical in their application as to be unpatentable . In any case , their patentability is impossible to predict in to make ~ e most of them ; . property righ ~ inpatents and copyrights make possible the creation of a scarcity of the products appropriated which couId not otherwise be maintained " Ar old Plant , Selected Economic Essays and Addresses 36 ( 1974 ) . . n ··t - · . . . ·· ' - d Ul dJ llle applIed legal literature . H Disclosure of the secret imperils its " alue , yet the outsid , er cannot negotiate until he knows what the secret is . Disclosure under an obligation of confidence strengthens the dis closer ' s leg ~ 1 position but may prove costly to the receiver , who must accept the oblIgatIOn before he knows the secret . The patent creates a defined set of legal righ ts k ? own to both parties at the outset of negotiations . And although t , he patent wIll seldom dIsclose the real value of the patent the owner can disclose , such information protected by the scope of the I ~ gal monopoly . Indeed , most know - how Or trade - secret licensing takes place within the framework of patent rights , ' 6 the agreement involving both a license of the patent and ~ n ' undertaking to disclose , how to apply the technology effiCIently . ThIS reduced transaction cost increases the efficiency with which ' inventions can be developed . Fourth , a patent system enables firms to signal each other , thus redUcing the amount of duplicative investment in innovation . Once a patent has ' been issued , other firms can learn of the innovative work of the patent holder and redirect their work so as not to duplicate work already ' done . Indeed , the patent gives its owner an affirmative incentive to seek - out firms and inform them of the new technology , even before issuance , if the most efficient and hence patent - value - optimizing way to exploit the invention is to license it . Under a regime of trade secrecy , the competitive firm might never learn of a ' competitor ' s processes and would not learn of the technology incorporated in a new . product until it was . marketed , . During this period , the investments made III a search for technology already invented by others is wasted . This private incentive to disseminate information about the inventio ~ should be distinguished from the reward for disclosure , theory traditionally discussed . That theory assumes that , tlie disclosure effect of the patent system comes from the dIsclosure on the public record . After a patent is issued , other firms have an incentive to inyentsubstitute ' technologies even if the substitute technology is less efficient than the pate ented technology ' but can be produced more cheaply than the existing royalty rate . Even more efficient inventions should not , from a social point of view , 3S The archetypal case involves idea submissions to large firms by volunteers . To protect . themselves , such firms often require Submitters to sign contracts severely limiting their rights usually to a small dollar Sum and whatever rights arise under the . patent system . .

Of course , the patent holder cannot offer discounts to everyon ~ who threatens to look for a substitute . The patent system enables a competi : or to show his seriousness by obtaining a patent , and the patent enables h , m to dis , c1mle sufficient information to enable the holder of the first patent to evaluate itS prospects without destroying the value of his position . If . b ? th > ' · ; : l " ~ : ? ' i agree that a substitute innovation ~ hose net cost is less than t ~ e ex , sting royalty rate is sufficiimtly likely to make the investment worthwhIle as long , as the competitor is faced with the existing royalty rate , then th ~ y . can agree to share the rents from the existing patent in a manner that elImmates ~ : competitor ' s incentive to duplicate . To the extent the ~ atent syste ~ facih - . tates these transactions , it reduces socially wasteful lnvestment . Such transactions are either more expensive or impossible under trade secrecy where the potential entrant may not even know that the earlier discovered technological alternative exists . ' Fifth , a patent system reduces the cost of maintaining control over tech nology . Under a trade secret system , the owner must control access to the technology and make specially tailored arrangements with : hose who must ' , have access to ' it . These precautions can affect the cost of usmg a process or . ' developing a product . Resources devoted to keeping the technology secret are saved , just as legal protection of property rights generally reduces the need for investment in self " help . Sixth , a paten ' t system improves the structure ' of the returns to innov ~ tion . Trade secrets create special incentives for processes that can be effiClently practiced in secrecy by a single firm . Other innovations are disfavored . A , patent system covering all the useful arts provides a ~ niform . str . ucture of incentiveswithout regard to the possibility of economIc explOItation 10 se - cret . , . In addition , a patent system provides a return based upon the . eC ? no ' : ' lc , value of the technology rather than speculation on its wealth distnbution , effects . Hirshleifer has pointed out that one way to profit from a discovery of a new technology is to acquire assets whose price will rise due ~ o the technol - . 31 Compare the opposite results obtained by George L .

Justice Douglas ( whose concern about the output constraints of the patent system permeates his opinions ) , suggested ' that the invention must reveal a " flash of creative genius , JJ42 - w hatever that is . Con ~ . igress provided in section 103 of the Patent Act of J 952 that the standard is . . ' . ' non - obviousness : " The patented subject matter must not have been obvi ' / ~ us to one skilled in the relevant prior art at the time the invention was , ) " made . 43 But the test is not particularly helpful . If obvious in this section " ·were read to mean obvious - that is something that comes immediately and ' ( : readily to mind - then the standard would vary little from a substantial . novelty standard . But numerous inventions that were not easily and imme ~ " ' diately ohvious either to their inventors or to others have been held·invalid { ' by the courts . For instance a patent on an antenna design was held invalid . . ' , because the method of searching for the design - not the design itself - was known to the art . 44 The only modern Supreme ·Court case upholding the validity of a patent involved a . battery which was not only obvious to those in field ; hut which was a battery that they positively believed would not work and refused to believe did after it had been demonstrated to them . 4s In my 1966 article , I attempted at length to explicate the mysteries of patentability iaw byturning to ( among other sources ) the reward theory of economic literature . The focus of the inquiry , I reasoned , ought to be on separating those iiIVentions that would have been made absent the incen tives of the patent system from those that would no ! . 46 Low - cost inventions sufficiently rewarded by the innovator ' s head start should not be patentable . Since these innovations would exist anyway , I reasoned , there is no reason to pay the cost of the patent monopoly . The courts should use the non obviousness test , r wrote , " to evaluate the magnitude of the costs involved in a given innovation / ' 47 Bowman 4 ' has pointed out , correctly , that to the extent my discussion implied the inquiry was to be focused on the conditions under which the . invention before the court had been m ~ de , it was misleading . An inventor should not be penalized because he was a low - cost inventor . Bowman argued that the inquiry should be focused on the kind or type of innovation . But this is an impossibkfactual inquiry : How isa court to determine the hypotheti - ogy and then disclose it 38 Thus h EI " from the cotton ' ' . , e suggests I WhItney could have profited· this techilOIOgic . : r ~ bY bUYItng cotton - p : oducin ~ .

Rev . supra note 41 at 332 - 33 . i ~ dence in support of the validity of the patent . 53 In my 1966 article , I ' criticized these cases on the grounds that the subsequent commercial success ' of the innovation said nothing about the cost conditions of producing the ' innovation , and indeed that a rule stating that commercially successful pat - I ents were valid was a rul ~ that said that all patehts that mattered were : ' valid . S4 It might be reasoned that the subsequent commercialsuccess , shows : that a demand for the innovation existed , that thisdemand must have been { perceived , and if the innovation was easy to make , it would have been t made , But the innovator before the court may be simply . the person who first " : responded to that demand . Once the prospect function is introduced to the discussion , the bearing of commercial success on the question of pat entability becomes clearer . ' The fact that a product or process within the terms of the patent claim ' is commercially successful tells the court that the ; ; 0 patent serves as the foundation for a series of now valuable contract rights . " , ' By announcing , that the subsequent v ' alue of those rights will , be taken into accourit if , the patent leads to a successful product , the courts increase ' the security of the investment Process necessary to maximize the value of the patent . , The problem can be illuminated by looking at a fundamental feature of patent syst ~ m . Most technological information is not subject to ' existing patetit rights . The reader persuaded by , the virtues of a property right in technological information by the earlier discussion might , in a burst of en thUsiasm , ask : Why not property rights in all technological information ? The short answer is that the arguments for a property right in technological information all depend on the assumption that investment in the search for ways to enhance the value of the information is needed . As to static , known information the proper incentives for its acquisition and use exist without a property right : The person , who acquires the information obtains the benefit from having it . He is not entitled to more , because hedid not create the information nor invest in its improvement . To illustrate , consider the technology of hammers and nails . One who learns how to hammer , or to make nails , or to make hammers , will benefit ' from doing so in an amount that takes , into account his comparative efficiency in learning and carrying out the activity . There is , of course , a need to improve the technology of hammers and nails , and any student of the modern fa . $ tener industry will realize that this is in fact a ' rapidly moving ' area of contemporary technology : ' But the minute novelty is introduced , a , potential patent arises . Ifsomeone discovers that a change in the traditional 49 The foc ~ s of that article was on explaining what the Courts had done notan : developing a theory , of the economic function - of the patent system , ' , , " . 50 Graham v .

Another approach which might be derived from the economic literature is to separate those inventions that can be practiced in secrecy from those that cannot , and deny patentability to the former on the theory that the head start or secrecy incentive is mOre nearly equal to that offered by the patent system for the former than for the latter . Thus patentability would be denied to innovations on industrial processes . But the problem is that for all the rea - . sons given above , the output constraint of a secrecy system is greater than that of a patent system . This is an easy point to see if the choice is between a seventeen - year patent and seventeen years of secrecy . It is more elusive if the choice is between three months of secrecy and a seventeen - year patent . But consider the impact over time if the diffusion of each sUcceeding technolog - ical advance were delayed three months . ' , Although my 1966 effort to derive a manageable standard from the eco nomic literature was a failure ( and that failure a motivation for the develop ~ ment of the theory here ) , I remain convinced that its reasoning accurately reflects the ·central problem that has bothered the courts . " The courts , influenced by the reward theory , view the patent system as a difficult prob - ' lem of trade - offs between the incentive effects and the output constraining effects . They have reasoned that the system can be improved by weeding our the marginal patent - t1wpatent offering the least net gain , which they tend to visualizeas the relatively trivial invention enjoying significant commercial sucCess , " He who seeks to . build a better mouse trap ' today , " the Supreme . Court said in its leading modern decision on patentability , " has a long path to tread before reaching the Patent Office . " SO And in another important recent decision , the Court sought to encourage challenges to patent validity by holding that patent licensees are alwayS ' free ( whether or not the license provides differently ) to challenge the validity of the licensed patent . 5 ' The Court observed that " licensees may often be . the only individuals with enough economic incentive to challenge the pateritabiiity of an inventor ' s discovery , " and fashioned a rule designed to facilitate such challenges in ~ ight of " the important public interest in permitting full and free competition III the use , of ideas which are in reality a part of the public domain .

" ' ~ ? - : , . tO ' reward the inventor for hisinvention , then why shouldn ' t he be awarded all of the present value of his invention ? The simplicity of this argument ' breaks down , however , if we take the vieIV that the inventor ' s contribution is not the invention itself - which eventually would have been made by someone else - but the time of the invention . The patent should reward not for the whole value of the - invention , but for the value of being first . This would suggest long patents for " big jumps " and short patents for " little jumps . ' . ' ' ' But Barzel has pointed out that an invention can be too early and ' that a reward based on priority in time ' induces inefficiently early invention , Big jumps are by definition the early inventions . So that suggests cutting the ! term for " big jurnps " to offset the incentive for inefficient haste , Perhaps the ' ! i ; uniform term results from these two offsetting factors . : " " The prospect function suggestS another approach to the selection of the ' , i ' patent term . Operation of the prospectfunction requires that the owner have ; ' : : : , most of the present value of the invention for the investment period . If this ' . . were aboutfive years , the remaining twelve would give the owner a . Iarge " , part of the present value ' atreasonable discount rates . " Unification of Control Industrial organization economists have tended to view the unification of control of patents that . perform economically ~ ompeti " g , functions as a standard problem of horizontal merger . 59 Where the market share of the unified patents is significant , they have tended to see a loss of competition in an important factor of production . ' Introduction of the prospect function greatly complicates this problem . The prospects generated by the patent system are largely shaped by techno logical history . Ownership of different parts of what can be most efficiently ' exploited as one prospect may be indifferent hands . The only way to obtain the efficiency gains of a prospect may be to permit the parties to rea ' rrange control of the various patents involved . ' To return , to the mineral claim analogy , a claim system may generate separate ownership rights in areas that upon further development turn out to be subject to the most efficient exploitation under unified control . For in - stance , a single main shaft . may be sufficient for all mines , or the works of one mine may threaten the safety of another , Unification of control may provide the most efficient solution . SimilarlY , two patents may be so closely related that it makes sense to look for improvements to both at once , or , s7 Th . is is the conclusion in William D . Nordhaus " , Invention , Growth , . and Welfare : A Theoret ~ cal Treatment of Technological Change 79 ( 1969 ) . 5S It has been suggested that the limited term is necessary to ' clear the patent register and reduce patent transaction costs .

Pc , t . " t Disclosure The reward theory has tended to emphasize the disclosure role of the In exchange - for ' his invention , the inventor , gets a , seventeen - year monopoly . But this is only so if the disclosure of the invention in the patent is sufficient to enable others to use it ; otherwise the inventor may have both the patent and secrecy . Thus the literature has been puzzled by the apparent failure of the patent system to perform this function . · 7 This " failure " occurs because the patent system requires disclosure of the invention at the time of the patent application and , as we have seen , the application may occur years before the invention is commercialized . . This feature can be understood in light of the prospect function . The prospect creates an incentive in the owner to efficiently disseminate informa tion about the invention . himself . He will do this directly , not through . the balky mechanism of a formal patent description . The purpose of the descrip tion inthe patent is not to disclose the commercially relevant technology , but to provide a c ~ ntext in which the legalllmits of the claim acquire meaning . " · ~ t : · " ' ~ g ~ ed , but the common theme is a desire to preserve the reward while r ~ ducii1g the output constraints of the patent system . Any form of compul sory licensing destroys the prospect function because the patent owner loses lhe ability to control who can use the patent . Third parties can search for : ways to increase the value of the patent and when they find it force the ~ wner ' to licensethe patent at the regulated rate . ' Covernment . Patent ' Policy ' Yr . There has been a contemporary debate over whether the United States f ; hould make its patents available to all free of charge or offer exclusive } licenses . • ' Students of that debate will recognize that the arguments for c ' " exciusive licenses have foreshadowed the synthesis of this essay . ·· The re Ki ' iwardfunction suggests free use of inventions ( viewed as already made ) . The i . . prospect function suggests the granting of exclusive licenses of patents . ( viewed as in need of further development ) . conversely , the search for improvements to one may carry the risk that that improvement will infringe the other . Consider the situation in the cracking patents case . ·o This technology developed without any single firm obtaining a dominant pioneering patent . Ownership of patents relating to numero ' us different but closely related cracking processes was ~ ispersed in a large number of firms . Process innova tions were occurring rapidly and aU the firms were searching fOr improve ments . If ownership of the patents was not unified , then each firm would ' have to shape its research program in relation to its patent position although that might not be the most efficient research strategy . Thus firmA would not look for improvements to the patented processes of firm B ' . and Vice versa . These considerations did not escape the Court ' s notice . " An interchange of patent rights . . . is frequently necessary if technical advancement is hot to be blocked by \ hreatened Iitigation . " ·l . These speculations suggest that examples of agreements of this type ' should be examined to determine how they address the problem of efficient . management and coordination of effort by the firms . to increase the value of . the patents invoived . One simple solution may be to simply make all patents available to all firms with an important position and let everyone begin again . Pursuit of these speculations may clarify the process and conditions under which a monopolistic inddstry will be more efficient than a competitive one . Schumpeter argued forcefully but without analytic rigor that this is an important case in the modern world . · ' From the perspective here , the ' phenomenon turns not upon the siz . e of the firm , but its dominance over a . fruitful technological prospect . Such a condition could be consistent with small firm size and the absence of a monopoly in present products . Efforts to study the validity of Schumpeter ' s hypothesis by looking at technological output by firm size may be missing the phenomenon involved . · J . . Compulsory Licensing Compulsory licensing is the patentreform most frequently . conside ~ ed in the economics literature . · 4 The proposals are not always clearly specified or . 60 This case is summarized in George L .

Studies 61 ( 1943 ) is an early This persp ( . : . . tive throws light on the efforts , through statutory amendment or patent office , procedure , to increase the amount of disclosure in patent documents in pursuit of the ideal of the reward theory , 68 The effect of such efforts is to raise the cost and complexity of patents without increasing the amount of economically meaningful information disseminated , Trade Secrets If the patent system is so much superior to trade secrecy , then why not eliminate legal protection of trade secrecy ? This position was urged upon the Supreme Court in Kewanee Oil CO , V . Bicron COrp . 6 > The reason why this position is wrongly conceived is that trade secrecy , operating io the context of a patent system , reduces the cost of the patent system . If patents cover the basic framework of the technology , then less important but nevertheless ' costly and valuable information can be protected by trade secrets but ex changed and disclosed within the protective framework of the patents . This reduces the incentive to apply for patents on this less important information and the reduction in the number of patents ( for the same amount of technol ogy ) is a cost saving . In addition , rules that permit the patentee to retain important information makes patents that can be infringed in secrecy more enforceable . Process patents can be infringed without alerting the patent owne ' r to that fact . But if potential iofriogers must obtain information from the patent owner before they infringe , their ability to ' iI \ frioge without notice to the owner is greatly reduced . Government SUbsidy of Applied Research Government subsidy of applied research has been seen as a way to create incentives for research while avoiding the otitput constraint of a patent , But if government subsidy brings with it a loss of the patent property system , it mayhave the effect of reducing rather than increasing the rate of technolog ical improvement . Even if the government follows a policy of taking patent rights , it may identify and manage them less efficiently than a private firm , This problem could be solved by permitting the private , subsidized firm to identify and keep all patents . But then the danger is that the government subsidy will simply displace private expenditure , ' The Organization of Basic Research The patent system cannot perform the Prospect , function in the context . of basic research because of the inability to fashion a meaningful property right 6lI S . 1321 and 5 . 2504 , 93d Cong . , 1st Sess .

[ Although authoritative assessment of the effects of the patent system re mains a task beyond the ambition of this essay , the legal culture provides two kinds of data useful· to the task . First , it shows how defined property rights in information significantly lower the costs of transactions concerning . such information . And second , the frequency of interferences within the . patent systemindicates that the problem of duplicative search is not a negli gible one in the development of technology . 290 THE JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS FAllACIES IN THE INTERPRETATION OF INFORMATION COSTS * YORAM BARZEL University of WasMngton It· is probable that all efforts to prove a conttnued bias in the working of cofftpetition as stich , . . . are doomed to failure . t IN recentyears , one of the areas singled out as having the potential for wasteful behavior is that of information . It is claimed that expenditures on certain kinds of infOrmation will yield negative social value . In their maximizing behavior , people seek and use discovered oppor tuni . ties , whether or not they are " socially desirable : " For instance , stealing is practiced . Not surprisingly , great moral pressure and resources are used to restrain thieves . One cannot expect individuals , however , to refrain from all socially undesirable behavior since , even if they wanted to , they cannot always be certain which activities are ·undesirable . Two types of wasteful behavior with respect to information have been identified . One is associated with speculative activities , ' and the other with signaling or sorting . ' Great ingenuity has gone into the construction ofmod els describing them . Common to both sets of models is tbe notion that some kinds of knowledge neither affect allocation nor increase social product . Nevertheless , they will be procured by those who benefit from them , though their benefit is entirely at the expense oEothers . In some fundamental sense , " waste " doubtless does occur· in ' that situation . . Even the most casual observation reveals numerous actual instances ' " I wish to thank Armen Alchian , Ste " ven Cheung , Paul Cootner , SanforQ Grossman , Chris topher Hall , Richard Hartman , Jack Hirshleifer , and Richard Parks for their valuable com ments .
