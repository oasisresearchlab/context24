Involving British - Chinese Immigrants in Participatory Action Research : Lessons Learnt from the Field Shichao Zhao School of Design and Creative Arts , Loughborough University s . zhao @ lboro . ac . uk ABSTRACT British - Chinese communities in the United Kingdom have expe - rienced an increase in discriminatory behaviour with other com - munities due to the COVID - 19 pandemic and the stigmatisation it has brought about as a result of the speculated COVID - 19 origins . Therefore , as a pilot study , this paper investigates how Participatory Action Research ( PAR ) , principally the integration of interactive technology with co - design activities , can be applied to support the producing and sharing of community - based immigrant heritage for British - Chinese citizens . In addition , the reasoning behind why British - Chinese communities have faced cross - cultural barriers when sharing their values and signifcance of their heritage more widely within British society during the COVID - 19 pandemic has also been explored . This study potentially makes a signifcant con - tribution to the literature because design - led inquiry was used to explore design strategies and considerations of interactive technol - ogy that improved the participation of British - Chinese immigrants in sharing the signifcance of their intangible heritage socially , equally , and coherently during the COVID - 19 pandemic .

ACM ISBN 978 - 1 - 4503 - 9893 - 0 / 23 / 07 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1145 / 3563657 . 3596107 with the strong debate regarding Britain’s colonial legacy and rela - tionship with modern China , has brought this sharply into focus regarding one of the oldest established migrant communities , the British - Chinese . The history of British - Chinese immigration spans more than 240 years since the frst Chinese citizen immigrated to Britain in 1779 and settled in Edinburgh , Scotland [ 4 ] . Currently , there are 400 000 Chinese immigrants in Britain , a fgure that ac - counts for 0 . 7 % of the British population [ 23 ] . In the frst months of the COVID - 19 pandemic , this community has endured a signif - cant rise in receiving stigmatisation than any other ethnic minority group on a global scale , as a result of the origins of the COVID - 19 outbreak [ 2 , 29 , 51 , 57 , 60 ] . In contrast to other minorities , it has been argued that the British - Chinese lack the unifying force of a shared religion or a British - based popular cultural form to mark out a distinctive public profle that is not based on the dated , stereotypical image of their long - standing presence in the ethnic catering business ( e . g . Chinese restaurants , Chinese supermarkets ) [ 38 ] . However , this community has a rich and complex cultural heritage with a web of oral his - tories , cultural artefacts and traditions passed down through the generations . There have been projects that focused on capturing and representing these narratives in the wider British society , but they were primarily based in areas with large traditional China - town communities ( e . g . London and Manchester ) [ 30 ] . There has been a lack of research on more dispersed British - Chinese commu - nities , especially those living in rural counties that often have low levels of ethnic diversity . Limited attention has been focused on how to support immigrants to express their cultural identity and build social ties across generations based in the local community and society . From the perspective of safeguarding heritage , it is clear that valuable immigrant stories and the spiritual heritage of immigrants disappear with time . Therefore , this study aims to con - tribute to flling a signifcant research gap regarding how we can support British - Chinese cross - generational immigrants to refect their cultural identity and values within a digital heritage setting . Through understanding and exploring the cross - cultural barri - ers that hinder more dispersed British - Chinese communities from sharing the values and signifcance of their heritage more widely in British society , this study aims to take innovative initiatives in order to help both demonstrate and help preserve the heritage of British - Chinese communities . I utilised Participatory Action Re - search ( PAR ) to conduct these studies with British - Chinese citizens to seek the potential of interactive technology and how it can im - prove what they are currently experiencing within the sharing of their immigrant heritage during the COVID - 19 times . Additionally , design - led inquiry was applied to explore design strategies and con - siderations of interactive technology that could potentially improve the participation of British - Chinese immigrants in sharing the sig - nifcance of immigrant intangible heritage socially , equally and 45 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Shichao Zhao coherently during the COVID - 19 pandemic . Moreover , this study evaluated the foundational work in a more practical lived context . This included deliberately exploring whether the connectivity of interactive technologies could be used as a positive attribute to innovate within the dispersed populations of British - Chinese , such as those living in rural South Shields , Hebburn and Jarrow in the Metropolitan Borough of South Tyneside , in the United Kingdom . A feld study and participatory design workshops were conducted to understand the barriers and concerns that British - Chinese citi - zens faced in sharing their heritage within the wider British society and to collect information on their preferences regarding diferent technological approaches . 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 The Impact of the COVID - 19 Pandemic on Chinese Communities Due to the COVID - 19 pandemic , there has been a signifcant rise in the number of hateful events and behaviours towards Chinese citizens [ 58 ] . This includes the likes of discrimination , stigmatisa - tion , marginalisation and violence [ 2 , 29 , 51 , 57 , 60 ] . In particular , these events have been recognised on an international scale and saw the virus be referred to as the ‘Wuhan Virus’ or ‘China Virus’ [ 28 ] , additionally , there has been widespread discrimination on various social media platforms , for example a signifcantly pop - ular Facebook page known as ‘Subtle Asian Traits , ’ originally a jam - packed Facebook group full of Asian experience and valida - tion of one’s diaspora struggles ( i . e . through memes , diaries and comedies ) displayed a rapid increase in racist comments and xeno - phobia after the COVID - 19 outbreak , even between inter - Asian and inter - minority groups there was a great deal of tension to the point where page administrators had to step in and lock comments to avoid further events [ 1 , 54 ] . In the UK alone , hate crime towards people of Chinese origin ( and even appearance ) had a 50 % increase than in previous years [ 39 ] . Smith et al found that approximately one - quarter of the UK population held stigmatised ideologies to - wards both people from and those within Chinese communities [ 51 ] . Additionally , economic damage was also an impact on Chinese business owners as 30 % of respondents from another survey stated it would be safer to not eat at Chinese restaurants to avoid risk and uncertainty of becoming infected with the coronavirus [ 19 ] . Likewise , British citizens thought it was ‘best’ to avoid densely populated Chinese areas such as China town , this was specifcally associated with the younger demographic who had a tendency to hold a stigmatising attitude [ 51 ] . Thus , causing signifcant impacts on Chinese citizens as they were unable to feel safe and secure in their own country , specifcally causing a sense of not belonging for the British - Chinese generation of immigrant families [ 5 ] . For example , a British - Chinese citizen who was born in the UK experi - enced racial abuse while on her way home ; additionally , another British - Chinese citizen and her daughter highlighted that children within their community and school were told by parents to ‘stay away’ from all Chinese people as they are all infected with the coronavirus [ 5 ] . Overall , it is apparent that the global pandemic is having a negative impact on those with Chinese relations and origins , which in turn has caused a sense of not belonging , unsafe - ness and insecurity within their British - Chinese communities and is limiting how they can comfortable and confdently share their background , origins and heritage which is the roots of who they are . 2 . 2 Immigrant Studies in Human - Computer Interaction In Human - Computer Interaction ( HCI ) studies , developments in the use of interactive technology in the case of immigrants have pro - vided functionality which has addressed their immediate needs ( e . g . mental health , domestic abuse and social services ) , specifcally in terms of long - term settlement [ 10 , 11 , 16 ] . For example , migration remains one of the most signifcant challenges one can face , and although technology cannot overcome many of its barriers , it has the potential to facilitate the improvement of the experience [ 35 ] . Furthermore , language and cultural barriers often have the possi - bility of threatening social relationships between grandparents and grandchildren in immigrant families , this can make daily discourse and cultural events , family history sharing and digital storytelling challenging , which may in turn cause ‘intergenerational drifts’ [ 36 ] . However , literature providing insights into how cross - cultural barri - ers that dispersed populations such as the British - Chinese currently face when it comes to sharing their heritage is extremely sparse . Cultural values within the domestic settings of immigrants have been explored by some projects , such as the ‘Our Home Sketcher’ system , which utilised collective memory theory to shape the mem - ories and former experiences of immigrants through paper - based home sketching [ 24 , 49 ] . Media such as audio , images and tangi - ble user interfaces have also been used efectively to document memories and stories via digital technology [ 20 , 34 , 43 ] . Tangi - ble design work has proven to be an imperative aspect of shared appreciation between families and generations , especially when it comes to preserving , re - creating and passing down heirlooms , memories and oral history [ 61 , 62 ] . However , there has been limited attention or focus on how to break down cross - cultural barriers that immigrants face in sharing the signifcance and values of their intangible heritage . The intangibility of immigrant heritage does not gain the same or equal attention and consideration like other tangible heritage during natural disasters or conficts [ 18 ] . Sharing their heritage , values and experience has been further hindered by the unprecedented increase in the discrimination that has arisen as a result of the COVID - 19 pandemic . This discrimination has taken a toll on immigrants’ behaviour and isolated them from society as we know it . On the other hand , PAR as a sort of well - established research approach has been considered and utilised in HCI studies , especially in discussing how to engage underrepresented groups in local communities to tackle social problems collaboratively in a computing setting [ 56 ] . 2 . 3 The Potential of Participatory Action Research PAR has been utilised as an approach to facilitate the collaboration of vulnerable communities in Europe , especially immigrant groups . This is because it shows the potential that could support the expres - sion of multiple identities and complex narratives [ 6 , 47 ] . This ap - proach also specifcally considers the ambiguities , disruptions , and incoherence of the integrated cultural and societal positionings in 46 Involving British - Chinese Immigrants in Participatory Action Research : Lessons Learnt from the Field DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA an immigrant setting [ 32 , 33 ] . Researchers and professionals share the authority and execution of research projects with participants in PAR . Meanwhile , participants , co - researchers , and equal partners could also gain scientifc knowledge and methods to potentially understand their own reality [ 21 ] . The involvement of participants in PAR is not only limited to preliminary investigations or practical design phases , but also various levels of participation in the entire research project . This is not only a design - driven piece of research that focuses on a fnal output , considering this is research relating to and impacting immigrant diaspora , it was important that their voices were traceable and included in all stages of the research study . Thus , benefcially , PAR is a bottom - up strategy that provides the potential for fexibility and refection for participants , which in turn would generate rich research insights into their experience and how they feel this problem should be solved . The participants in this study were British - Chinese immigrants who have experienced discrimination as a result of the COVID - 19 pandemic . Thus , in this study , I applied PAR to emphasise the par - ticipation and action by the British - Chinese participants [ 6 ] . PAR enhanced my ability to work collaboratively with the participants to explore how to share their heritage during the COVID - 19 pandemic and in post COVID - 19 times . Furthermore , it can engage partici - pants ( especially marginalised groups ) as ‘community - partners’ to contribute their daily experience and thoughts , empowering them to change their current situation [ 55 ] . It is even more important that when participants discuss their thoughts , experience or stories that are in opposition to mainstream values or information coming from the mainstream press , they are able to do so safely and feel comfortable expressing their thoughts without fear of stigmatisa - tion [ 44 , 45 ] . In this study , I also considered PAR as an approach rather than another method because it ofers a comprehensive set of principles and practices to design activities and analyses data [ 46 ] . It also provides a method kit from which I could use multiple methods , such as interviews , ethnographic designs , group discus - sions , mapping and so on [ 13 ] . Another feature of PAR is that it is a cycle - based process , which allows researchers to go through the stages of planning , action , refection and evaluation to more clearly understand the entire research process [ 25 ] . This feature also of - fered me an opportunity to consider integrating PAR and co - design to refect my role and positionality as a designer and facilitator to work with British - Chinese immigrants in an HCI study setting . 3 METHODS This project was granted ethical approval by the host University . In regard to initially building up potential connections for this study , I had previously built relationships with the Chinese community based in China Town Newcastle ( a city in the United Kingdom ) in one of my prior studies that investigated cross - cultural appre - ciation of Chinese intangible cultural heritage and through this connection , I was able to become a member of a WeChat commu - nity group which facilitated the opportunity for me to reach out to existing members in regard to this topic . In this group chat , I raised a discussion around how well integrated they feel within society after the impacts of stigmatisation around the global COVID - 19 pandemic have shifted how they display and share their immigrant heritage . This discussion gained traction and I was able to connect with multiple families living within the community who had frst - hand experience of these impacts and I encouraged them to express their opinions and after a while asked if any families would like to volunteer and engage in a study that could further explore how to overcome the topics raised within their discussion . Thus , the families enabled the research direction to be mapped out as once they volunteered , I conducted a preliminary stage called ‘Mapping’ in which I informally spoke to them regarding the topics raised in the community WeChat group and how they as not only partici - pants , but as co - researchers , could map out the strategic direction of where they think this study should head in and how it would be useful to their own community . It is worth noting that while acting as co - researchers , the participants had no intent to be involved in the academic writing of this research or be involved in any as - pect of the data analysis . In this informal discussion , the families mapped out four key stages that this study will follow : 1 . Mapping ; 2 . Seeking ; 3 . Collecting and Producing ; and 4 . Collaborating and Refecting . To probe into the feasibility of such a research approach , this project took the form of a pilot study and consisted of three stages , as illustrated in Figure 1 . Firstly , Preliminary Stage ‘Mapping’ , con - ducts a preliminary discussion with participants to make a specifc research plan and structure to further explore the sharing of British - Chinese immigrant heritage . Secondly , Stage 1 ‘Seeking , ’ consists of a series of family - based virtual workshops and discussions that were conducted to engage immigrant family members ( by assisting them as designers ) to understand the barriers and concerns that the older and younger generations of British - Chinese citizens faced while sharing their heritage within the wider British society . Thirdly , in Stage 2 , ‘Collecting and Producing , ’ data was collected regarding the participants’ preferences for various interactive technological approaches . Finally , in Stage 3 , ‘Collaborating and Refecting , ’ the potential of interactive technology supporting British - Chinese im - migrants to share their stories and heritage was collaboratively explored . With this approach in place , this allowed for a bottom - up investigation that initially probed into a smaller neighbourhood - based setting to test the feasibility of propelling this into a larger and more populated British - Chinese community . 3 . 1 Procedures From the original discussion , three families with diverse family roots volunteered to take part in this study . To be more specifc , this study was conducted with three families who were geograph - ically dispersed across South Tyneside , United Kingdom ( Jarrow , Hebburn and South Shields ) , over a period of six months ( i . e . June 2020 to November 2020 ) . By engaging with the existing connec - tions that I had with British - Chinese citizens in Newcastle ( China Town ) , I was able to enlist three family generations ( grandparents , parents , son and daughter ) with an age range of 19 to 76 years ( seven males and ten females ) by means of the snowball sampling method . After each family member had signed a participant con - sent form , I had permission to act as an additional family member and conducted conversational research , which was later supported by exploratory interviews . Which means I could join their family group chat and immerse myself into their family - life and daily dis - cussion without interrupting their daily routine . This would allow 47 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Shichao Zhao Figure 1 : Timeline , Stages and Locations of the Study . me to give some opinion or discussions into the topics they openly discussed . It is worth noting that this was included as an aspect of the consent forms they signed and was included in the ethics approval gained by the host University . The PAR approach that was applied in this study was designed to support the process of democratic and collaborative research with the families [ 13 ] . It of - fered an efective contextual and inclusive way to study this diverse group of participants who were not familiar with digital technology [ 26 ] . All participants were given a code name for purposes of the analysis that followed , for example ‘FA2 - PA = Family 2 , Parent’ ( Table 1 ) . Because of the COVID - 19 pandemic and the consequent lockdown in the United Kingdom , the entire study was conducted virtually with the support of social media . The grandparents of Families 1 and 3 did not speak fuent English ; therefore , I chose WeChat ( which is a Chinese multi - purpose social media messaging application ) to conduct the workshop and interview these three families . I am a native speaker of Mandarin and have mastered two types of Chinese dialects ( Cantonese and Wu ) ; therefore , I used multiple Chinese dialects together with English to communicate virtually with participants . Additionally , Miro , an online collab - orative whiteboard platform , was used to enable participants to brainstorm together efectively using digital sticky notes . Table 2 characterises participants’ technology profciency alongside their age range . After holding a discussion based on their technology profciency , the participants fell into the following three categories : Beginner , Intermediate and Expert . Beginner : refers to those partic - ipants who know what technology is , but do not quite understand the functionality around how to use it on a daily basis . This may include , for example , a participant who does not have a smart phone and are familiar with social media ( e . g . WeChat ) . Intermediate : this category refers to participants who are familiar with technology and use it often , but are still not that familiar with all of its capa - bilities and functions . This may include , for example , a participant who is familiar with a smart phone and are capable of using some functionality of it and also social media ( e . g . checking Moments , uploading photos on WeChat or Facebook ) . Expert : this is the fnal category and is for participants who are familiar with technology , use it on a daily basis and are extremely familiar with and capable of using all functionalities . This may include , for example , a partici - pant who fully understands social media and its capabilities as well as some further functionalities such as digital design or graphic design . 3 . 2 Data Collection and Analysis The screen shots , written notes and recorded audio were transcribed and analysed using Thematic Analysis ( TA ) [ 9 ] ( Braun and Clarke 2006 ) . TA was used to analyse the interview data and daily conver - sations with the families based on WeChat . The refections gathered from these activities were used to form potential design strategies that may assist the cross - cultural sharing of immigrant heritage . TA explores ways to analyse and report themes across multiple activities while acknowledging the active role of the researcher in making sense of the shared stories and their signifcance [ 63 , 64 ] . In the data analysis , to intricately link the original data and identi - fed themes , I applied an Inductive Approach to develop codes and themes from the collected data . This potentially ofered a more ex - pansive and broader analytic process to refect the pertinent issues raised by the data [ 9 ] . 4 PILOT STUDY 4 . 1 Preliminary Stage : Mapping As this study intends to take a PAR approach , it was imperative that I understood the participants needs . Therefore , I conducted a preliminary discussion with them to make a specifc research plan and structure to further explore the sharing of British - Chinese immigrant heritage during the COVID - 19 time . On top of this , the general purpose of this preliminary stage was to help set boundaries 48 ( profciency ) Involving British - Chinese Immigrants in Participatory Action Research : Lessons Learnt from the Field DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Table 1 : Participants’ Code Names Family ( FA ) Grandparent ( GP ) Parent ( PA ) Daughter / Son ( DS ) Family 1 1 2 3 Family 2 2 2 2 Family 3 1 2 2 Table 2 : Characterisation of Participants’ Technology Experience Characterisation of Technology Experience Age 19 - 35 36 - 55 56 - 76 Beginner 0 1 3 Intermediate 2 4 1 Expert 5 1 0 within my approach while building up trust and a sense of safety , therefore , I began by introducing the rationale and main purpose of this study and its context . Initially , trust was gained by developing a sense of inclusion by making the participants feel comfortable in a research setting and as though it was an aspect of their daily life , this was made possible by giving them the choice of how we should communicate in a comfortable way , for example , allowing them to choose WeChat as our primary platform for communication , as well as ensuring that the timing of this study was conducted around them and their daily routine . Furthermore , I also clarifed with the participants that they could withdraw from this study at any point , if any aspects made them feel uncomfortable . Once I was able to gain trust and a sense of safety , I moved into a preliminary discussion , which was based on the social media platform WeChat . All families were added to a group chat with me . I allowed for the participants to take lead on mapping out three stages ( as shown in the sections below ) and me as the facilitator expanded upon their initial topics to broaden the scope of them and prepare a specifc schedule of events to follow their given directions . Three initial directions were suggested and identifed what we should explore : 1 . refect the experience of sharing heritage during the COVID - 19 time ; 2 . creating content around immigrant heritage ; and 3 . designing strategic considerations regarding how to further expand social impact . More specifcally , I also ensured to clarify my position further as a facilitator which was to help the organisation of their plan and to refect their experience , as well as how to collect and create the content of immigrant heritage with the support of interactive technology . 4 . 2 Stage 1 : Seeking To gain a deeper understanding of the barriers and concerns that British - Chinese citizens faced in sharing their heritage , I created three separate group chats in WeChat to participate in the three diferent families’ daily conversations over a period of three months . In this stage , each family had an individual group chat , to conduct their discussion . This stage intended to utilise a series of family - based virtual workshops and discussions were conducted to engage immigrant family members to understand the barriers and concerns that older and younger generations of British - Chinese citizens faced in sharing their heritage within the wider British society . 4 . 2 . 1 Narrative Conversational Research . The daily conversations of each family were collected using a combination of screenshots and written notes that which refected my observations regarding the family’s conversational fow , personal emotions and experi - ences . The notes focused primarily on transcribing voice messages that the family shared with each other and recording their emotions and manners when speaking . This online conversation - based re - search aforded me the opportunity to understand their experiences and concerns . In the group chat , I was not only a listener ; once I became familiar with the families as a whole , as a facilitator I tried to join in on their conversations to encourage them to open up about any topics they wanted to discuss , which enabled me to conduct further discussions with the family members to collect more in - depth stories and feelings . It is worth mentioning that I only followed the topics that were mentioned by the participants to further explore how they would feel about their experience , rather than giving any opinion / experience of my own . Both the discussion notes and the screen shots were thematically arranged in line with the analytical process of TA , resulting in diferent stories of how they shared their cultural heritage and their concerns while doing so [ 60 ] . This conversational research also enabled me to see the reality of how the British - Chinese demonstrated their heritage and their narrative family - based conversations . Furthermore , it enabled me to have a contextual environment to conduct further interviews and capture more details . 4 . 2 . 2 Interviews . After the daily discussions were complete , inter - views were conducted . These interviews were intended to capture the subtlety of the families’ shared experiences and as a follow - up exploration regarding the specifc details of some family members’ stories and WeChat discussions , for example a topic and story that had arisen multiple times was around discriminatory events . The interviews were audio - recorded and transcribed . The questions mainly explored more details of their daily thoughts and reactions when sharing their heritage , and further captured their feelings relating to discriminatory events they had discussed . The main questions asked were : 1 . How do you normally share / demonstrate 49 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Shichao Zhao your cultural heritage in daily life and special occasions ( e . g . Chi - nese New Year ) ? 2 . Do you have any concerns when sharing your heritage ? 3 . How do you feel about this kind of experience ? 4 . Have you tried to do something to stop discrimination taking place ? 5 . Why do you think it is difcult to express your concerns or work on stopping discrimination from happening in the frst place . 4 . 2 . 3 Findings . From the data three themes defned that refected the participants’ experiences in sharing their cultural heritage in their local society : ( 1 ) unexpected discriminatory experiences , ( 2 ) a sense of powerlessness and ( 3 ) cross - generational household con - fict . Unexpected Discriminatory Experiences . Discriminatory expe - riences were mentioned numerous times in the group chat of all three families . Based on their daily experiences , these discrimina - tory experiences were becoming a new social pressure , especially when sharing representative Chinese traditions or other symbolic Chinese objects . FA2 - PA shared their experience during the Chi - nese New Year when they put traditional Chinese paper cutting art on the windows as decorations and hung Chinese lanterns on the front porch of their house , all of which were later broken and smashed . FA2 - PA sent a voice message in the group chat with a very upset tone : ‘ I cannot believe they broke them again . I think that this is why I heard some people shouting in front of the house last night . They smashed all of the paper cut art and even broke the window ! ’ In addition , Family 3 discussed how they were going to celebrate the Chinese New Year but mentioned that it was not safe to decorate the front door of their house during this time because of potential vandalism . Sense of Powerlessness . When the families faced discrimination , their unprecedented sense of powerlessness was mentioned a sig - nifcant number of times . This powerless feeling was described as coming ‘from everywhere , even in the air’ by FA3 - DS . From the group chat it was evident that diferent generations expressed their powerlessness from varying perspectives . As FA3 - DS put it : ‘ You cannot even avoid this kind of discrimination . It is everywhere on Twitter , Facebook , and even on TV . The discrimination is every - where . Any post about the Chinese will have thousands of hateful comments which are shoved in your face . ’ FA1 - PA expanded on this : ‘I think the powerlessness is because the Chinese cultures or other elements have been stigmatised , and to be honest , we do not know how to respond . The only thing we can do is to avoid it to make the discrimination become non - violent . ’ Furthermore , neglecting local communities and society was also mentioned , as stated , for example , by FA2 - PA : ‘ The helplessness is more from the refection of the whole society , comparing this to the discriminatory cases of other races . The social opinion of the public has a very diferent response to the discriminatory experience of British - Chinese , which is almost as if it does not exist or matter . ’ Cross - Generational Household Confict . As a result of the sense of powerlessness discussed above , the family group chat also in - volved instances of arguing , especially between grandparents and grandchildren . The thrust of these arguments was how to deal with discrimination and how to express their own British - Chinese iden - tity . Grandparents argued that traditional Chinese culture should be passed down through the generations and should be embraced . However , since COVID - 19 has resulted in signifcant discrimina - tion against the British - Chinese community , they believe that their cultural heritage should be hidden from society and displayed only among their own family , as any public demonstration ( such as Chi - nese New Year festivals ) might result in increased discrimination . However , some grandchildren ( e . g . FA2 - DS and FA3 - DS ) disagreed with this , believing that the British - Chinese community should ex - plore their own way to demonstrate their exclusive cultural heritage and identity , and that the best way to counter the discrimination was to allow more people in the local communities to get to know their cultural heritage and to embrace it like the many other forms of cultural heritage present . 4 . 2 . 4 Reflection . Three themes have been formed through the col - lection of both narrative conversational research and interviews . These three themes identifed the actions that the participants wanted to take forward into the following stage . Firstly , the theme of ‘Unexpected Discriminatory Experiences’ was identifed by the participants and refected their daily experience and social environ - ment in which they faced during the COVID - 19 time . This provided frst - hand experience and evidence of discriminatory events taking place within British - Chinese communities . Secondly , the theme of ‘Sense of Powerlessness’ was identifed and demonstrated how participants felt about the unexpected discriminatory experiences that they had discussed in the beforementioned theme . Most impor - tantly , the fndings shed light on the fact that the social opinions of the public based on Western social media platforms increased both social pressures and a sense of powerlessness to the participants . Lastly , the third theme ‘Cross - Generational Household Confict’ raised a potential approach to overcoming the discrimination . The participants discussed that one of the potential ways in which to counter the discriminatory events taking place was to demonstrate their exclusive British - Chinese cultural heritage and stories . They believed that through sharing their immigrant heritage that this could have the opportunity of making them feel more comfortable , confdent and proud to demonstrate their cultural identity . There - fore , the main goal of the next stage is to build up a collaborative space that will enable the collection and creation of the participants’ immigrant heritage and stories to further explore how these could be demonstrated . 4 . 3 Stage 2 : Collecting and Producing In this stage , I organised family - based workshops to collect stories from the older generations to store them digitally in interactive devices alongside relevant related heirlooms or objects , as well as to discuss the participants’ preferences for diferent technological approaches . Each family had an individual group chat , to conduct the design activities with relevant discussions . 4 . 3 . 1 Cross - generational Exploration . The frst workshops were conducted using the WeChat group video call function that allows multiple members to join a call at one time and to view one an - other . Figure 2 illustrates two examples of the family - based group chat on WeChat . For each family , I organised and participated in a workshop and recorded the discussion . As the facilitator , I noted each of the participants’ insights regarding one of the questions on the whiteboards and attached them to the group chat so that 50 Involving British - Chinese Immigrants in Participatory Action Research : Lessons Learnt from the Field DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Figure 2 : Two Family - Based Group Chats on WeChat .

Figure 5 : Screenshot from a Family - Created Video in which the Family Present and Discuss a Possession . mind map . Data collection mainly included audio - recordings , writ - ten notes and screen shots of the individual family’s or member’s possessions which had been discussed during the group call . 4 . 3 . 2 Scenario Creation . Based on the workshop discussions , I or - ganised an additional workshop to specifcally discuss the potential of technology to support the sharing of their heritage . I used the method of co - created scenarios , as opposed to presenting them with pre - produced scenarios [ 53 ] . To achieve this , participants crafted their own scenarios based on diferent elements in the form of paper images and symbolic photos . Figure 4 presents two exam - ples of scenarios that were designed by diferent families . Based on the refection of places , possessions and stories , family mem - bers built a scenario of the back of this which included selecting two images ( one of a location , and one of a symbolic possession ) and supporting it with a story that ties it all together . Storytelling represents an efective contextual and inclusive means of conduct - ing research involving diverse groups of participants who are not familiar with digital technology . The aim of this workshop was to explore and better understand their preferences for diferent technological approaches . Every family was asked to discuss how to digitally demonstrate their heritage in diferent public settings . Based on the diferent scenarios discussed , the family members also co - designed a video - based online exhibition by generating content that related to ‘what’ they would like to share and ‘how’ they would like to share it . The content and layout of the exhibition were provided and designed by the participants ; on this basis , I edited the videos to refect their design . Figure 5 contains a screen shot from one of the videos a family created to exhibit a possession ( a jade necklace ) ; the video has English subtitles for non - Chinese speakers and features a split screen , with a video of the possession in question on one side , and an image of the location it relates to on the other . 4 . 3 . 3 Workshop Findings . During the workshop , information for a total of 46 individual heirlooms or objects ( e . g . old jewellery , diaries , photographs , etc . ) was collected . The information relat - ing to these pieces documented their exclusive immigrant journey throughout the years . During the workshop discussions , every fam - ily demonstrated their own heritage collections to express their sto - ries and journeys . FA1 - GP shared old diaries ( in Mandarin Chinese ) 52 Involving British - Chinese Immigrants in Participatory Action Research : Lessons Learnt from the Field DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA to demonstrate their experience with other family members when they had just moved to the United Kingdom . FA3 - GP showcased her jewellery to support a story that happened before moving to the United Kingdom , while also expressing her feelings of missing her hometown and family in China . The frst interesting theme is the signifcant meaning of family heirlooms and possessions . The younger generations expressed that they were not familiar with most of the heirlooms or objects discussed . However , they were very keen to learn about the sto - ries and how the heirlooms and objects came to them , since they believed that the stories of those collections were very precious and would help them better understand their family roots . FA2 - DS shared his thoughts in the group chat : ‘ Wow , I did not even see this ! This is so cool . I really want to get to know more about this . I like grandma’s stories . I miss when she used to tell us her old stories . ’ Fam - ily 3 also mentioned that the precious stories should be connected to old collections so that they would not be lost to the future . The tangible collections and their precious intangible signifcance are what formed the families’ exclusive immigrant heritage . As FA3 - PA put it : ‘ I hope I can record these stories from my mum . Then , I can listen to them when I am looking at old possessions . More importantly , we can keep these stories and collections to pass down through the coming generations of our family . ’ Lack of understanding is the second theme . The sharing of their heritage in public settings was also a topic that was ardently dis - cussed by the families . One common view was that exclusive im - migrant heritage should be shared in local communities and with the wider society . COVID - 19 brought new challenges to the British - Chinese communities , such as discrimination or stigmatisation and the families believed that sharing their heritage could help more people learn about the British - Chinese , which might lessen this . Families 1 and 2 both discussed their wish for interactions regarding the sharing of their heritage , and that this sort of interaction should be conducted in the local communities rather than in their own families . FA2 - DS said , ‘ We do not know whether sharing our heritage in the local communities will defnitely remove the discrimination , but we should do that to demonstrate who we are , and where we are from . I think lack of understanding is the main issue in discrimination experiences . ’ Therefore , by potentially opening up a dialogue as a po - tential design strategy that can engage non - British - Chinese citizens to have more opportunities to listen , watch , interact and learn about these immigrant stories . In this dialogue , it would not be a space for British - Chinese to more comfortably share their stories , but create a new space to embody the inclusivity of a whole community . Additionally , and more importantly , this could be an alternative approach to encouraging British - Chinese to both comfortably and confdently demonstrate their heritage and stories while maintain - ing the longevity of its standing within the community . The third theme is how technology could help . Against the back - ground of COVID - 19 and the national lockdown , the potential of interactive technology was also discussed . The families discussed their own personalised preference for how to demonstrate and share their heritage on the basis of the diferent scenarios that they brainstormed . For instance , Family 1 believed that the tangible user interface could potentially integrate their old collections with audio and video stories to demonstrate a point in time and a geographical location ( e . g . visiting a local park or waiting at a train station ) . This interface could provide very simple interactions to engage users to view short stories about the British - Chinese immigrants . Further , the physical interaction would be much more acceptable for demon - strating their heritage . FA3 - DS explained ‘I think digital technology will be helpful , but I do not mean social media or mobile apps , be - cause it might just attract a lot of discriminatory comments . I think if we could physically share it in our local communities , it would be better , because it is part of our daily life . ’ FA3 - PA added , ‘ Yes , we agree with that because even a very small interaction to engage people to learn about this will be supportive in helping us feel that we are members in this society too . ’ 4 . 3 . 4 Reflection . During the whole process of gathering heritage collections and stories from the families , they expressed and re - fected their thoughts and needs in regard to supporting the safe - guarding of immigrant heritage . For example , how can the tangible collections be integrated with the intangible values and stories that derive from and are passed down through family generations was both a thought and need raised by the families . Furthermore , a potential design strategy was generated and will be utilised in the next stage , which is to open up dialogues to engage non - British - Chinese citizens to gain the opportunity of listening to , watching , interacting and learning about these immigrant stories . Based on the social pressures that are plastered across social media and have been highlighted in Stage 1 ( Seeking ) , the potential of interactive technology in supporting the sharing of heritage was also further explored in this stage . Participants expressed that having a tangible user interface combined with visual storytelling ( videos ) and dia - logues ( audio ) could engage users as a design strategy as previously mentioned . More importantly , this supported the participants in designing the following stage which is to specifcally exploit how to share their own , and also experience their immigrant heritage in a collaborative setting . 4 . 4 Stage 3 : Collaborating and Refecting Stage 3 was intended to further exploit how interactive technology could support British - Chinese immigrants to share their stories and heritage , as well as how to form an impactful method of engaging more immigrants into this heritage sharing action . Additionally , as the theme of discrimination was prominent in Stage 1 and Stage 2 , it was important to carry this through into the current stage to further understand how this aspect could be faced or overcome through strategic design approaches , specifcally with regards to the design direction focusing more on how to re - tell the existing immigrant stories in a cross - cultural setting . During this stage , the practicality of the fndings that defned during the design process with the participants , as well as how they would be used , deployed and interact with the design outcomes in their daily life , were refected on . An online co - design workshop was organised on WeChat ; all the participants from Stage 1 were invited to this workshop together , and the information of the participants is the same as that outlined in the earlier Table 1 . 4 . 4 . 1 Co - design Practises . The co - design practises consisted of three main steps . Step 1 comprised of a two - hour introductory workshop , step 2 consisted of a four - hour co - design workshop and step 3 involved a four - week family - based activity . The workshops 53 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Shichao Zhao were conducted on WeChat . Stage 3 was a four - week family - based deployment activity in which all original 17 participants from the three families engaged in . I acted as the facilitator to support the delivery of the exhibitions in the workshops . Before the workshop was conducted , an Arduino toolkit was delivered to each family . The workshop consisted of three steps : ‘Get to know the tool , ’ ‘Let’s design something , ’ and ‘Let’s share it . ’ Before the workshop took place , I requested that the possessions that were discussed in Stage 2 were delivered to me . After the design process of the interactive diagram concluded , the interactive prototype was delivered back to each family for them to experience . In step 1 ( ‘Get to know the tool , ’ two hours ) , I used one hour to introduce the functionality of the Arduino starter kit to the participants . This step was intended as an introductory session to deliver an in - depth understanding of interactive technology as well as a tangible user interface to each participant , in order to support them in conducting the next step . The participants were not expected to master the ability to develop the diagram or demo , only to get familiar with Arduino to ensure that they were able to express their design ideas accurately to me . After this introductory session , a question - and - answer activity was conducted to help participants develop greater understanding of the potential of a tangible user interface based on Arduino . The rationale of this step was ( 1 ) to gain more insights regarding Arduino preferences and needs with respect to the technological artefact meant to enable them upon arrival , ( 2 ) to give them greater infuence over the tangible user interface , and ( 3 ) to familiarise them with an easy - to - learn and easy - to - use rapid prototyping technique . In step 2 ( ‘Let’s develop something’ - co - design workshop , four hours ) , each group ( family ) was asked to demonstrate one posses - sion with its corresponding place and story as photo - based elements to share their heritage ( based on the discussion and fndings from Stage 2 , ‘places , possessions and stories’ ) , as well as to sketch and design how they wanted to demonstrate their immigrant heritage and stories in the WeChat group discussion . Then , based on the discussion of Arduino in the previous step , the participants were asked to discuss how they would like to interact with stories from other families , and what functionality they preferred to utilise to demonstrate their heritage ( text description , audio / video and paper wireframes / paper sketches were all available to participants to use to explain their ideas in the group discussion ) . I acted as technical support to engage in their co - design discussion and help them ac - curately deliver their design ideas and integrate the video materials from Stage 2 ( Figure 5 ) into the low - fdelity demo . Based on their design ideas , we co - built an interactive prototype that consisted of a tangible user interface , a screen , a speaker and batteries . At the end of this step , we also discussed how they would like to integrate the above - mentioned objects with the interactive prototype as well as how they would like to demonstrate this in a public space . In step 3 ( ‘Let’s share it , ’ four weeks ) , the three families delivered to me the possessions and other relevant objects ( e . g . photos of mentioned places ) that had been discussed during the workshop in the previous steps . Once I had combined the participants’ pos - sessions with the interactive prototype in a box ( named ‘Treasure Chest’ in the participants’ discussion ) , I sent it to one of families and they had a period of one week to experience the ‘Treasure Chest’ within their family and their community . The participants decided on naming the prototype ‘Treasure Chest’ due to them often feeling a sense of happiness when being told stories from their elders and family in general , especially as some possessions may not hold value , it is often the story too that becomes the real treasure as it demonstrates the long and rich story behind it . When the week was over , they passed it to the next family so that they could experience it . After all three families had completed their week - long family - based and community - based experience , we had a catch - up meeting on WeChat . All of the participants were asked to discuss how and where they wanted to display the low - fdelity video demo , as well as how they wanted to share their immigrant heritage based on this demo . They then discussed and refected on how they felt about this design activity and the whole project jour - ney that they had been involved in over the previous six months . The main discussion topics were : 1 . How would you describe your experience of the ‘Treasure Chest’ with your family ? 2 . How did your community perceive the deployment of the ‘Treasure Chest’ ? 3 . How did you feel about the co - design workshop ? 4 . 4 . 2 Workshop Findings . The main aim of the co - design workshop was to support the three British - Chinese families in collaboratively designing objects which potentially made them feel more comfort - able and confdent about demonstrating their cultural heritage and immigrant stories in their local communities . Based on the fndings from Stages 1 and 2 , the interactive technology had the potential to enhance their engagement in sharing and demonstrating their heritage . Thus , in the co - design workshop , participants specifcally explored how to integrate and demonstrate heritage and their sto - ries via the interactive prototype and how they wanted to interact with and experience the interactive prototype . Figure 6 demon - strates an example of the interactive prototype that was discussed by the participants . The interactive prototype included fve main elements / functions : a tangible user interface , a sensor , a screen , a speaker and a battery . Furthermore , three key themes identifed through TA have been discussed in - depth below . Theme 1 : Defning Design . One of the topics that the partici - pants most frequently discussed was how to utilise the interactive prototype to integrate ‘place , ’ ‘possession’ and ‘story’ together for demonstration purposes . They believed that the tangible user in - terface ofered a platform that had the potential to display these elements together as a video - based resource for family - based preser - vation and community - based heritage demonstration . The display and size of the interface had to be easily portable and accessible . For example , FA3 - PA mentioned : ‘ I suppose what we are trying to design here is something like a small - sized video player which we can easily take or set up in our community , and the operation won’t be that hard for me and my grandparents in our family to use . ’ In addition , practicability and efciently as relevant functionalities had been discussed by the participants during the design process . They felt that the simplest possible interaction would most support the engagement of the prototype . The sensor chips provided par - ticipants with a direct interaction and autonomic experience with the immigrant possessions and stories . The rechargeable batteries could also enhance the convenience of participants and potential viewers to deploy this interactive prototype into their local com - munity for a longer period of time . FA1 - DS commented : ‘ I think rechargeable batteries are very handy , because we can quickly and 54 Involving British - Chinese Immigrants in Participatory Action Research : Lessons Learnt from the Field DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Figure 6 : An example of the interactive prototype that was discussed by participants . easily change the battery then take it anywhere to display . ’ Further - more , the speaker represented a ‘voice’ that supported participants in demonstrating their voice proudly and loudly in their local com - munity . During the design process in the co - design workshop , I had explained to the participants that the screen had the function of playing the sound of the recorded videos ; however , they empha - sised that they wanted to add an extra speaker . They wanted sound to be a signifcant component of their interactive prototype . The increased volume of the video would symbolise the British - Chinese immigrants’ longing to let their heritage , stories and experiences be heard in their community . As FA2 - DS stated : ‘ The reason that we would like to have this speaker is because we want to loudly share our stories , such as where we from or our unique immigrant heritage . . . I think we always tried to be quiet , but this just made us seriously transparent in our neighbourhood . ’ In general , participants wanted to design a minimalist interactive diagram to assist them to easily engage potential viewers to listen to their stories and understand their distinct immigrant heritage . Theme 2 : Content discovery . All of the places , possessions and stories derived from conversations with the participants . All of the families ofered a representative possession alongside a specifc place to demonstrate their immigrant heritage and stories , giving them autonomy of content and how to communicate it , for exam - ple , FA2 - DS mentioned ‘ Yeah , I think it is very important that we have freedom of designing this from our perspective , since it is our heritage , it’s kind of important we story tell in a way that we feel demonstrates it thoroughly without losing our history . ’ Thus , one of the families donated a vintage Chinese jewellery box as a carrier to demonstrate the interactive prototype alongside multiple other possessions , allowing them and others to relive their heritage and family history . As previously mentioned , the interactive prototype was named ‘Treasure Chest . ’ Figure 7 demonstrates the diferent components : tangible user interface , places , possessions and stories . The sensor chips were integrated with paper cards that had an image printed on them to represent the diferent places ; this was to help support potential viewers to interact with the tangible user interface . The interface itself also had images printed on paper cards ( e . g . a suitcase and a world map ) to give clear guidance to viewers on how to use the ‘Treasure Chest . ’ Theme 3 : Safe Space Building . In the workshop , the three families also discussed their experience of how they deployed the ‘Treasure Chest’ in their local communities , as well as how other residents interacted with . Additionally , due to the uprise in discriminatory events in Asian communities , understanding how they deployed the ‘Treasure Chest’ with consideration of this was an important aspect that was discussed . The creation of a ‘safe space’ was men - tioned . The participants believed the design activities created a comfortable space to engage them together in sharing their stories and cultural heritage . FA1 - DS elaborated on how they felt about the ‘safe space’ : ‘ It creates a very diferent space for us , for our case , it’s more like a virtual safe space that gathers us together to share our ancestral stories . ’ More importantly , this space also worked for cross - generational and cross - cultural families . FA1 - GP further described this perspective from a community - based perspective : ‘ Previously , we seriously did not know how to share old possessions or stories with our grandchildren . But now , we can demonstrate this to other people in our neighbourhood which is so nice and warm , they can play with the Treasure Chest , and also talk about it with us . To be honest , it was so nice . ’ On the other hand , there was another perspective that refected on the ‘safe space’ based on the participants’ experience during deployment , which was that discrimination was present during the community - based demonstration . FA2 - PA shared their experience and refected on the idea of a ‘safe space’ : ‘ When we were doing this , the news still mentioned that COVID is a China virus , which is really upsetting to us , because some of the people in our neighbourhood just shout at us with really disrespectful words . So , I am just wondering if the space we were talking about is just for British - Chinese people , or what we can do to use the space to fght against the racism and discrimination . ’ In general , the deployment 55 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Shichao Zhao Figure 7 : The contents of the ‘Treasure Chest , ’ alongside the relevant places and possessions . of the ‘Treasure Chest’ received positive and supportive feedback which suggests that this type of study could be used to face and fght against racism . 5 DISCUSSION This section comprises of three topics : frstly , a summation of the interactive features based on the design activities ( i . e . the co - design workshop ) and the feedback from the deployment of the ‘Treasure Chest’ ; secondly , a refection on the challenges and opportunities of PAR and co - design activities ; thirdly , a discussion regarding the limitations of this case study . 5 . 1 Features of Interaction The following key points and design strategies were refected in the design practices / activities , based on the main fndings from the pilot study : simplifed operation , cross - generational and cross - cultural collaboration , and future impact . 5 . 1 . 1 Simplified Operation . The co - design workshop ofered a space that gathered three families together with me ( as a designer who would support their design and development ) to explore how interactive technology - based rapid prototyping could help them to share and tell the story of their heritage . However , it was clear that participants had concerns about the technical aspects of the design process , as well as about how potential audiences could experience their design outcome ( i . e . the Treasure Chest ) in the local community . Thus , they suggested the most simplifed sensory experience , for example , touching , listening and watching . These sorts of experiences could also potentially match and refect the storytelling method that the participants had suggested in Stage 2 ( Collecting and Producing ) – place , possession and story . The tangible user interface with sensors ( touchable chips ) could form an accessible interactive method , and the visual representative posses - sion could potentially support audiences to readily understand the meaning of the interactive prototype [ 59 , 65 ] . During deployment , the Treasure Chest’s simplifed interaction and operation engaged more older persons to experience it without needing a tedious intro - duction . The simplifed operation of the interchangeable elements ( possessions ) was also mentioned by the participants . How to add interchangeable elements with sensors and video / audio resources was also a signifcant factor in their experience of the Treasure Chest . 5 . 1 . 2 Cross - Generational / Cultural Collaboration through Inter - active Interfaces . An interesting refection from the co - design workshop concerned creating a collaborative space for cross - generational family members . The participants included three gen - erations – grandparents , parents , and children . One of the key bar - riers faced by cross - generational immigrant families is that older family members do not know how to share their immigrant sto - ries and experiences with younger family members and with other people they encounter in their daily lives [ 36 ] . Furthermore , cross - cultural barriers ( for instance , cultural identity ) and the complex relationships between Chinese and the British - Chinese were also embodied in their daily life . However , the co - design process not only provided the participants with a platform to share their heritage by means of stories , but it also encouraged them to become more engaged with their family members to strengthen family bonds through critical making which enabled them to focus on designing and demonstrating a means to better understand not only their heritage , but also social issues through collective construction , con - versation and refection [ 50 ] . Additionally , by creating a dialogue in the design process , participants were able to discuss their difer - ence in opinion and values , but also decide upon a suitable design approach that captures both their values and opinions . By shifting the discussion from ideological diferences to a more design - based discussion , this helped more efectively pull out the common value and help disperse any confict that came about . This sort of cross - generational collaboration provided an open space and enjoyable way and space for younger and older generations to speak about family stories , especially as some of the older members did not speak English well . More importantly , the collaboration created a 56 Involving British - Chinese Immigrants in Participatory Action Research : Lessons Learnt from the Field DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA platform that demonstrated the immigrant / migrant process and the families’ journey from China to the United Kingdom . Potentially , the collaboration also facilitated the forming of British - Chinese immigrant heritage which potentially involved the participation of multiple generations . In stage 2 of the pilot study , the design strategy of opening a dialogue was discussed and within the design activities this element was applied in regards to facilitating how communities could embody the exclusive cultural signifcance of the British - Chinese stories and heritage , as well as how this could be comfortably shared within the local community and outside the realm of the British - Chinese . It is also worth mentioning that based on this cross generational and cultural collaboration , tangible heritage ( e . g . collections , heirlooms ) could be organically integrated with the signifcance of intangible heritage and cultural signifcance that is demonstrated on a simplifed interactive interface . 5 . 1 . 3 Future Impact . The participants’ passion regarding the de - sign of the interactive diagram ( especially from the younger gener - ations ) was unexpected . To be specifc , they were very interested in learning how to design the interactive prototype and how they could utilise their own possessions . An interesting fnding was that they discussed using rechargeable batteries to enable them to keep the ‘Treasure Chest’ for use in the future and to make it more portable . How to coherently integrate the new places , posses - sions and stories was the most signifcant requirement raised by the participants during their discussion in step 3 of the co - design workshop . The steps and procedures of the design activities and the simplifed design techniques should be incorporated into a toolkit to enhance the sharing of heritage in the local community . Toolkits have a long tradition , both in teaching electronics and in their commercialisation as products , and it also has been utilised to support learners ( e . g . children and older persons ) [ 40 , 48 , 52 ] . The interactive prototype discussed by participants ( see Figure 6 ) demonstrated how they wanted to utilise this in an impactive way for their community - based heritage sharing . Such a toolkit should also consider the two previous key points ( simplifed operation and cross - generational collaboration ) , as well as how microcontrollers ( e . g . Arduino or LilyPad Arduino ) could be integrated within the representative elements ( e . g . place , possession ) of heritage shar - ing . Thus , engaging more participants to refect on and design the toolkit is one direction for a future study [ 3 , 37 ] . 5 . 2 Challenges and Opportunities of Participatory Action Research and Co - design From the results reported in the previous section , several lessons could be drawn . These are relevant for future HCI projects that apply a combination of PAR and co - design processes with British - Chinese immigrants . In this section , three lessons learned were identifying the importance of earning trust during the research process , the necessity of building a safe space , and the refective considerations of working with the British - Chinese community . 5 . 2 . 1 Earning Trust . Earning trust was one of most signifcant factors in this study because there were multiple complex relation - ships throughout each research / design activity . These relationships included family - based relationships , local community - based rela - tionships and also the relationship between the participants and me ( as a designer / researcher / facilitator ) . The older generations ( i . e . the grandparents ) expressed their concerns around the necessity of sharing immigrant heritage , especially since they believed that the most suitable reaction when facing discrimination was just to ignore it . Moreover , they did not feel comfortable about sharing their experiences with non - family members . Thus , I had to face the problem of how to engage grandparents to talk about their feelings with regard to their experiences and their distinct stories . Furthermore , the use of both languages ( i . e . Chinese and English ) was also necessary . Another issue that hindered the participants’ expression was English and non - Chinese social media . Due to the language barrier and unfamiliarity with social media , the partici - pants did not fully trust that the research or design activities could potentially bring about change in the current situation . In Stage 1 ( Seeking ) , I spent more than three months trying to join in on the participants’ daily conversations in Chinese on WeChat . By speak - ing Chinese , typing Chinese and using Chinese social media I partly gained their trust , but also the cross - generational activities were extremely supportive when engaging grandparents and parents to share their stories and in conducting the co - design activities to explore the potentials of technology . Building up from families as a unit was an efcient way to engage myself to build up closer connec - tions and earn trust within immigrant communities . In this process , the diferent roles ( i . e . of researchers , co - researchers , advocates ) were extremely useful to strategically approach a community as a research site , while also establishing presence and connectedness [ 14 ] . 5 . 2 . 2 Building the Safe Space . On the other hand , based on the fnd - ings of the above - mentioned activities in the three stages ( i . e . seek - ing , collecting and producing , collaborating and refecting ) , PAR and co - design strategically demonstrated the potentials of creating a ‘safe space’ for engaging participants to share their experience and co - design the digital prototype [ 15 ] . In this ‘safe space , ’ participants could regularly share their stories , concerns and daily experience of some accidental event or news with cross - generational and cross - cultural ( British - Chinese , Chinese , and British ) family members and other local citizens . Especially in the beginning of this study , this space provided participants with a reliable place to share their trauma and experiences of discrimination during the COVID - 19 pandemic with their families . This space not only ofered a virtual space for communication , it also facilitated a sustainable timeline that made the participants feel more comfortable to share their daily experience at any time . At the beginning of this study and design process , seeking the most powerful technology approaches , which comprehensively demonstrate the story and experience of immigrants , is not prioritised . In contrast , the participation of each phase in the study should prioritise the involvement in develop - ing the research questions as well as maintaining a comfortable research environment . The reduction of education or instruction could also potentially be supportive to build up the space . This space also ofered me as a facilitator the opportunity to build up a sense of trust with the participants which was helpful when conducting the co - design activities with them . However , con - sidering that all of the PAR and co - design activities were conducted 57 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Shichao Zhao virtually due to the COVID - 19 lockdown , this ‘virtual safe space’ still has room for improvement . WeChat has shown its potential to support the build - up of trust with others , and helped to record daily experiences . Miro also efectively helped the participants to brainstorm and with their discussions , but it did not provide a satisfying user experience for them in terms of meeting the more technical and design - based targets . The ‘virtual safe space’ was not only needed as a comfortable and safe space for discussion , but also as an efcient design space that successfully refected participants’ experience or any thoughts they had as design outcomes . How to enhance the design of technical support in this space if physical design activities are not possible is another aspect that we should advocate for . 5 . 2 . 3 It’s More Than the Voice . In the previous discussion , the pro - cess of collection of the voices from family members and refection of these voices into the co - designed artefacts was frequently men - tioned . However , it is worth highlighting that the cross - generational barriers and the features of a specifc cultural group also need to be carefully considered as a complex process in every phase dur - ing the design practices or actions . In this case study , the posi - tion / role of social media was weakened purposely due to the ‘sense of powerlessness’ that was given by the British - Chinese families , as well as other Asians globally [ 1 , 54 ] . The diferent or conficting cultural / political values and ideologies have impacted the prefer - ence for ‘vocal demonstration’ to a large extent . In HCI research , participatory / co - design has been considered one of the main ap - proaches to exploring the potential of computer - related products and activities in vulnerable communities [ 12 , 27 , 31 ] . However , the related literature regarding immigrant - based stigmatisation that has come about due to the cultural / political values and ideologies has not been well developed . In this study , one lesson learned is that there is a good understanding of Chinese social customs and societal values , and also , Confucian thoughts are signifcant for the designer / facilitator to embody empathy and inclusivity . Especially when I was working with the grandparents , a solid understanding of Mandarin was not enough to facilitate the progression of the entire study . Thus , how to be more considerate and empathetic when opening a dialogue and conducting a participatory activity is essential . The discussion of both empathy and inclusivity has been discussed extensively [ 8 , 22 , 41 , 42 ] . However , in many cases , the research context is based on a European universal value or a sort of common sense in Western society . Unfortunately , referring back to what was mentioned at the beginning of this section , the context of conducting this study was to base a comprehensive criticism in a public opinion environment . For example , quoting one of the partic - ipant’s ( FA3 - DS ) descriptions : ‘ The voice of criticism is everywhere , on Twitter it is being discussed globally and politically . . . when the same bunch of people have been blaming the Covid - 19 outbreak on the Chinese yet talk about inclusivity , don’t you think it is a bit ironic and despairing ? . ’ Thus , I suppose one question that is probably worth thinking about is that if the researcher has diferent ideological perspectives on immigrants ( e . g . communist or socialism ) , how can the researchers / facilitators embody the empathy with their co - researchers and equal partners in PAR - based design activities [ 7 ] . 5 . 3 Limitations of the Case Study The ‘virtual safe space’ created a place that empowered British - Chinese participants to express their heritage and stories freely , without the fear of stigmatisation . From the experiences gained in this study , I derived a series of lessons learned regarding the impact of the results in PAR and co - design activities . I found that simplifed operation has the potential to engage cross - generational and cross - cultural collaboration among British - Chinese families in the sharing of their immigrant heritage . However , as this study was conducted during the COVID - 19 pandemic and its multiple lockdowns , a factor which cannot be ignored is that of the ‘sense of powerlessness’ that was discussed previously . The discussion around the participants’ experiences of sharing their community - based heritage still raised some concerns around how far this study or action needs to go and whether it is really strong enough to break the stigmatisation . The reality is that during this study the British - Chinese partici - pants were still being directly afected by the media and the stigma - tisation that was being spread throughout society and within their own local communities . Thus , we must ask whether this ‘virtual safe space’ was strong enough . It is also worth asking whether this ‘virtual safe space’ allowed people to heal from their trauma or whether it was just for sharing their heritage . Furthermore , in terms of future work , I am currently planning a series of follow - up workshops with other British - Chinese families who are interested in continuing this work . These workshops will further explore the iteration of interactive technology based on the previous deploy - ment and whether over the long term the online workshop and relevant activities will make this ‘virtual safe space’ stronger and expand its efect in the local community . 6 CONCLUSION As a pilot study that intended to test the feasibility of a PAR ap - proach , it is apparent that this study has been successful in achiev - ing this in the setting of immigrant families and communities , es - pecially within the beginning of this study as it has enabled the building of a safe space that helps earn trust and allows freedom of speech . It has also proven to be an efcient method that takes a bottom - up approach and can expand from smaller - scale neigh - bourhood impacts to larger scale societal impacts . Moreover , seeing how PAR can be organically combined with co - design activities is a valuable insight gained from this study and ofers an opportunity for researchers to accurately identify the positionality of design strategies and considerations in studies going forward . Notably , the three families mentioned integrating their old collections and interesting stories as a way of potentially sharing their immigrant heritage . This form of integration potentially gives the old collec - tions the intangible signifcance of being able to engage younger generations or other groups to have the opportunity to explore the exclusive immigrant heritage of the British - Chinese . Further - more , this integration might also help preserve immigrant heritage since the collections , heirlooms and related audio - or video - based data were recorded . Thus , the design opportunities were how to integrate family heirlooms and objects with audio and video data while based on a tangible interface to form a storytelling method 58 Involving British - Chinese Immigrants in Participatory Action Research : Lessons Learnt from the Field DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA to attract more attention . The acceptance of heritage sharing , espe - cially during the COVID - 19 pandemic , has brought huge challenges for the British - Chinese . However , interactive technology also of - fers the potential to support the sharing of immigrant heritage in local communities . One of the main design strategies was to support the interaction between immigrant heritage and potential story - listeners , as well as to conduct an interactive demonstration in local communities . In the design process of interactive technol - ogy , the engagement of British - Chinese and local citizens is vital ; the design process is also regarded as a heritage demonstration . It is worth noting that the physical interaction with the heritage collections was deemed to be more acceptable in engaging people who are also interested in sharing their heritage . However , how to support cross - cultural barriers ( i . e . the language of storytelling ) and the efectiveness of sharing heritage in the whole society are the prominent technological challenges for the post COVID - 19 era . As a part of a community practice regarding civic participation , future studies should focus on co - design workshop - based activities to design interactive technology in order to support the sharing of the British - Chinese heritage .
