BMC Primary Care The usage of data in NHS primary care commissioning : a realist evaluation Alexandra Jager 1 * , Chrysanthi Papoutsi 1 and Geoff Wong 1 Abstract Background To improve health outcomes and address mounting costs pressures , policy - makers have encouraged primary care commissioners in the British National Health Service ( NHS ) to increase the usage of data in decision - mak - ing . However , there exists limited research on this topic . In this study , we aimed to understand how and why primary care commissioners use data ( i . e . quantitative , statistical information ) to inform commissioning , and what outcomes this leads to . Methods A realist evaluation was completed to create context - mechanism - outcome configurations ( CMOs ) relat - ing to the contexts influencing the usage of data in primary care commissioning . Using a realist logic of analysis and drawing on substantive theories , we analysed qualitative content from 30 interviews and 51 meetings ( 51 record - ings and 19 accompanying meeting minutes ) to develop CMOs . Purposive sampling was used to recruit interviewees from diverse backgrounds . Results Thirty - five CMOs were formed , resulting in an overarching realist programme theory . Thirteen CMOs were identical and 3 were truncated versions of those formed in an existing realist synthesis on the same topic . Seven entirely new CMOs , and 12 refined and enhanced CMOs vis - à - vis the synthesis were created . The findings included CMOs containing contexts which facilitated the usage of data , including the presence of a data champion and com - missioners’ perceptions that external providers offered new skillsets and types of data . Other CMOs included contexts presenting barriers to using data , such as data not being presented in an interoperable way with consistent defini - tions , or financial pressures inhibiting commissioners’ abilities to make evidence - based decisions . Conclusions Commissioners are enthusiastic about using data as a source of information , a tool to stimulate improvements , and a warrant for decision - making . However , they also face considerable challenges when using them . There are replicable contexts available to facilitate commissioners’ usage of data , which we used to inform policy rec - ommendations . The findings of this study and our recommendations are pertinent in light of governments’ increasing commitment to data - driven commissioning and health policy - making . Keywords Realism , Commissioning , Primary care Introduction NHS primary care commissioning involves the planning , contracting , and monitoring of primary care services ( GP , dentistry , pharmacy , and ophthalmology services ) [ 1 , 2 ] . Although the NHS has a documented ‘commissioning cycle’ consisting of nine discrete steps and activities , [ 3 ] in practice , commissioning is ‘messy and fragmented , ’ [ 4 ] and only some activities undertaken by commissioners * Correspondence : Alexandra Jager alexandra . jager @ exeter . ox . ac . uk 1 Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences , University of Oxford , Oxford , UK Page 2 of 12 Jager et al . BMC Primary Care ( 2023 ) 24 : 275 overlap with the official nine - step ‘commissioning cycle’ [ 5 ] . General practice deals with around 90 % of NHS contacts while receiving under 10 % of the budget , but is facing myriad pressures , including increasing patient demands [ 6 ] . Primary care services are essential to a sus - tainable health service , but their commissioning is com - plex and frequently reformed [ 7 ] . The 2012 Health and Social Care Act mandated research evidence as a core consideration in commission - ing [ 8 ] . NHS England has created tools and guidance to facilitate evidence - based commissioning [ 9 ] . Evidence can be defined as any form of information that can be used for making judgements or decisions [ 10 ] and be split into quantitative evidence ( henceforth ‘data’ in the context of this study ) and qualitative evidence [ 11 ] . The defining hallmarks of quantitative evidence are its ability to express things in numerical form across multiple cases . Examples of quantitative evidence ( i . e . data ) include data from public health surveillance systems , evidence from Cochrane reviews , and surveys , whereas qualitative evi - dence involves nonnumerical observations including interviews , focus groups , and observations [ 11 ] . Exam - ples of datasets NHS commissioners use include NHS RightCare and the NHS Atlas of Variation in Healthcare , which contain various types of variation data including spend and prescribing data [ 12 , 13 ] . A commitment to using data in commissioning has been cemented in recent policy documents , including the ‘Next Steps on the NHS Five Year Forward View’ ( 2017 ) , and many Sustainability and Transformation Plans ( which aimed to implement the 2014 Five Year For - ward View ) [ 14 , 15 ] . Recently formed Integrated Care Systems ( ICSs ) use connected datasets to facilitate health improvements [ 16 ] . However , the literature on this topic has criticised the quality and utility of the data available , and noted commissioners’ challenges using them [ 12 , 14 , 17 ] . A recurring conclusion is that more attention should be paid to contextual factors if evidence use is to be understood and increased [ 18 – 20 ] . This study aimed to understand how and why primary care commissioners ( henceforth commissioners ) use data to inform commissioning , what outcomes this leads to , and what factors facilitate and inhibit the usage of data in primary care commissioning decisions . It builds on our realist synthesis ( systematic review ) on the same topic [ 21 ] by comparing the findings , highlighting overlaps and new insights and nuances . Methods Realist evaluations aim to understand how policies and interventions work , who they work for , and in what circumstances by analysing primary sources [ 22 ] and creating context ( C ) + mechanism ( M ) + outcome ( O ) configurations ( CMOs ) showing how an outcome is achieved through the triggering of an underlying mech - anism in specific context ( s ) [ 23 ] . By developing and refining CMOs , researchers develop causal explana - tions about why programmes and interventions work ( or don’t ) , and why the same programme resources might be acted upon in different ways by different participants in different contexts [ 23 , 24 ] . In realism , contexts can be material , social , and psychological , and are the features of situations that affect the triggering of programme mecha - nisms [ 25 ] . Underlying causal processes known as mech - anisms often cannot be seen or directly observed , even if they lead to an observable outcome , and provide explana - tions of why change occurs [ 26 ] . Realist evaluations cul - minate in a realist programme theory comprising one or more CMOs [ 27 ] . This publication follows the RAMESES reporting standards for realist evaluations [ 22 ] . Data collection This evaluation is based on primary data from inter - views and meetings collected between November 2020 and April 2022 , hence spanning much of the COVID - 19 pandemic . Recruitment and data collection : interviews A realist sampling strategy should enable the testing of contexts [ 28 ] and interviewees should be selected based on their ability to confirm , falsify , and refine theory [ 29 ] . Selecting dissimilar settings enables the discovery of common and unique concepts across different contexts [ 30 ] . Purposive sampling was used : 23 interviewees were commissioners selected to ensure diversity based on the financial performance and geographic location of their respective Clinical Commissioning Group ( CCG ) , and job titles . Seven academic experts on evidence - based commissioning were interviewed , defined as people who had published research on evidence - based commission - ing and had experience of collecting and analysing pri - mary data such as meeting observations on this topic . Commissioners were selected for interview due to their first - hand , in - depth knowledge . Academic experts were chosen partly because recruiting NHS employees was challenging during the COVID - 19 pandemic , but also because they had had the opportunity to observe com - missioners in person . Commissioners were recruited using existing contacts , snowballing , and by contacting CCGs . Experts were recruited via email . Data collection : meetings During the COVID - 19 pandemic , some CCGs began making the recordings of and minutes from their Pri - mary Care Commissioning Committee meetings publicly available online . All CCG websites in England as well as Page 3 of 12 Jager et al . BMC Primary Care ( 2023 ) 24 : 275 YouTube and Google were searched to identify as many meeting recordings and minutes as possible between June 2020 and April 2022 . The portions of the meeting recordings related to data usage in commissioning were transcribed and analysed . Data analysis All content was analysed according to a realist logic of analysis and linked to substantive theories where possible [ 27 ] . These substantive theories were found in the realist synthesis , the broader realist meth - odological literature , recommendations from other researchers and readings of the broader economic , social , and psychological literature . Realist evalua - tions should include an initial programme theory , i . e . a description of how a programme is thought to work and why , at the outset to facilitate the development of CMOs [ 31 , 32 ] . This realist evaluation began once a synthesis on the same topic [ 21 ] was already under - way . This synthesis included a draft programme the - ory consisting of hypotheses in a non - realist format about the contexts influencing commissioners’ usage of data ( Additional file 1 ) . Many of these hypotheses were later adapted into full CMOs and accelerated CMO formation by providing an initial framework for CMO development . In addition , the CMOs from the synthesis served as a de facto programme theory for using the constant comparison approach : analysis of the three content sources ( synthesis , interviews , and meetings ) was conducted using an interactive conver - gent design , meaning content from different sources was analysed in a similar timeframe [ 33 ] and interac - tively so that the developing findings could ‘talk’ to each other [ 34 ] . This was used in conjunction with the constant comparison method , which prescribes the ongoing comparing and contrasting of findings across different sources and asks the researcher to consider what information found using one source could add to another ( Fig . 1 ) [ 35 ] . Specifically , this included the following activities : • Using substantive theories discovered in the realist review to develop CMOs based on the meeting and interview content . • Using findings from the realist synthesis and content from meetings to inform the interview guide , which was updated on an ongoing basis . • If a CMO was found in one content source but not another , the researchers re - read all the content sources in which the CMO was apparently not pre - sent to ascertain if the evidence for a CMO had been missed in the initial analysis . • Pawson’s method of reconciliation : where appar - ently contradictory findings were found i . e . ( partially ) contradictory CMOs across the content sources , these were further investigated to by re - reading and re - analysing the content sources [ 36 , 37 ] . Upon re - reading and re - analysing the content , it was usually discovered that what initially looked like a contradic - tion could be explained and reconciled by the devel - opment of more nuanced and refined CMOs . The CMOs developed were richer than they would have been had the CMOs been developed noninteractively , or had only one content source been used to develop CMOs , even when the same CMO was found across all sources . Furthermore , some argue congruence and / or Fig . 1 Constant comparison approach Page 4 of 12 Jager et al . BMC Primary Care ( 2023 ) 24 : 275 complementarity of findings across disparate sources is desirable , since having multiple independent assessments come to the same conclusion strengthens credibility [ 38 ] . Interviews were conducted using the realist interview - ing approach where the researcher’s theory is the subject matter of the interview , and the interviewee is there to confirm , falsify , and refine the theory [ 39 ] . We based the interview questions ( Additional file 2 ) on a three - phase interview model whereby realist theories and CMOs were progressively refined and fine - tuned [ 28 , 40 ] . In preparation , three interviews with lay members of health services commissioning organisations were conducted to preliminarily explore the types of evidence , and in par - ticular data , they had used and observed being used dur - ing their involvement in commissioning . Interviewees were also asked to comment on the phrasing of inter - view questions and suggest improvements . Results Overview of content from primary sources Interviewees Thirty people were interviewed ( 23 commissioners and 7 experts ) ( Additional file 3 ) . Meetings Content from 51 meetings was analysed ( 51 meeting recordings and 19 accompanying sets of minutes across 18 CCGs ) ( Additional file 4 ) . Contexts , mechanisms , and outcomes A total of 35 CMOs were created based on the content from interviews and meetings . Sixteen were identical to or truncated versions of those found in the synthe - sis ( Additional file 6 ) , 7 CMOs were new , and 12 CMOs had some degree of similarity to those in the synthesis but the content from interviews and meetings provided additional insights and nuances . The substantive theories used to develop the 19 new and revised CMOs are listed in additional file 5 . The CMOs have been grouped into CMOs related to facilitating contexts ( contexts promoting commissioners’ usage of data , highlighted green ) and inhibiting contexts ( contexts triggering mechanisms that made the usage of data unlikely , highlighted orange ) . Whilst some of the outcomes identified were dichotomous ( i . e . data were either used or not to inform decision - making ) , others are more nuanced as they e . g . outline the alternative forms of evidence commissioners may seek if data are unavail - able or deemed unsuitable , or the ways in which commis - sioners use data as a tool or warrant . The mechanisms identified provide insight into the ‘why’ i . e . the reasoning contexts triggered amongst commissioners that caused them to use ( or not use ) data a certain way . CMOs that were identical or truncated versions of those in the realist synthesis We were able to directly validate 16 CMOs ( CMOs 1 – 16 ) from the realist synthesis . Thirteen of these were CMOs developed from the meeting and / or interview content identical to those in the synthesis ( Additional file 6 ) , and three were truncated versions of CMOs from the synthe - sis , i . e . part of the CMO present in the synthesis was not present in the CMOs developed based on the interview / Table 1 New CMOs developed Green background = facilitating contexts , orange text = inhibiting contexts Page 5 of 12 Jager et al . BMC Primary Care ( 2023 ) 24 : 275 meeting content . This provides additional robustness and validity to the synthesis’s findings . New CMOs based on interview and meeting content Seven new CMOs ( CMOs 16 – 22 ) vis - à - vis the synthe - sis were developed , i . e . these CMOs were not present in the synthesis ( Table 1 ) . Six of these were based solely on interview content , and one CMO on meeting content . New CMOs : facilitating contexts If data indicated a potential cost saving without compromising patient care ( often related to prescribing data ) , commissioners were inclined to use the data , believing this was a valid way to make savings ( CMO 17 ) . Commissioners sometimes had access to data they thought were incorrect due to the way clinicians coded , documented , or reported data . The errors in the data were presumed to be due to gaps in knowledge or capabilities , and commissioners believed that offering clinicians help and support was a good way to improve the quality of data , leading them to work with clinicians to achieve improvements ( CMO 18 ) . ‘Because I think with any incident reporting it can become a bit of…a kind of perception of a lot of pro - cess and very little return . So I think the one thing I would absolutely be pushing is that we show the difference that it makes by reporting incidents and really starting to encourage more of the lessons learned and why it makes a difference and why it’s important . ’ ( Commissioner 21 – A , Meeting 21 , Agenda item : Primary Care Quality Report ) . Trusting the source of data or their owner increased commissioners’ belief that data were credible , in turn making them more likely to use the data ( CMO 19 ) . For example , one interviewee lauded Open Prescribing , which was ‘led by clinicians’ and being from a ‘good data source’ facilitated the data’s usage : ‘It’s up to date , it’s user friendly , that’s why I think we tend to look at it and in a lot of ways because it’s driven by pharmacists who understand what are the things that we need to know…’ ( Commissioner inter - view 4 , Deputy Director of Finance for a CCG ) . New CMOs : inhibiting contexts If commissioners believed they had a moral imperative to commission a service , this was sometimes done even if there was an absence of evidence ( including data ) , since it was the ‘right thing’ to do ( CMO 20 ) . If commissioners felt data had been ‘forced’ upon them or not introduced in a palat - able way , they disengaged , sometimes actively looking for flaws or loopholes in the data , and were thus less inclined to use them ( CMO 21 ) : ‘…RightCare was a methodology that was being pushed on us from , from a central perspective as well and it was used as very crudely as benchmarking… without doing the bit about bringing in clinicians with you…it drove a lot of people to be… almost dis - interpreting the data i . e . finding where the loopholes were , why it was wrong… . ’ ( Commissioner interview 4 , Deputy Director of Finance for a CCG ) . A lack of capacity to do data analysis left commission - ers unable to use data ( CMO 22 ) . Commissioners believ - ing that external support lacked NHS - specific knowledge and expertise made commissioners view the data ( analy - sis ) produced by them as less valid and useful ( CMO 23 ) : ‘So yes , somebody coming in to actually help you to work out your problems and you solve your prob - lems works but I remembered yes , there was a lot of consultancy work at the beginning of CCGs and PCT days and it was highly ineffectual… . it was actually a good way of throwing money at some - thing and then and then finding that it did not fix the problem . The trouble with experts , they’re often not experts . They often haven’t actually worked in the field . ’ ( Commissioner interview 14 , clinical com - missioner ( GP ) . CMOs refined based on interview and meeting content Twelve CMOs developed from the interview and meeting content had some degree of overlap or similarity to those in the synthesis , and were refined or expanded using con - tent from meetings and interviews . The following typo - graphical emphasis ( bold , italics , underline , etc . ) are used to show how these CMOs compare to those from the synthesis : • Portions of CMOs without any typographical empha - ses indicate convergence of findings , i . e . the portion of the CMO identical to the synthesis . • Bold text indicates a new finding compared to the synthesis . • Italics indicate a complementary finding , i . e . a similar finding to the synthesis . • Crossed - out text indicates information that was pre - sent in the synthesis but is not present in the meeting or interview CMO ( note : where complementary find - ings are present , italics are used in lieu of crossed - out text , since the findings are sufficiently complemen - tary / similar ) .

BMC Primary Care ( 2023 ) 24 : 275 Refined CMOs : facilitating contexts The eight refined CMOs related to facilitating contexts are presented in Table 2 . Interviewees described using data to identify commis - sioning priorities , although they stressed that data could only provide a ‘starting point , ’ and that commissioners would need to complete additional analysis to develop commissioning plans ( CMO 24 ) . One commissioner described using RightCare data to identify areas for fur - ther investigation : ‘So we know what areas for example we’re an outlier in in terms of usage and in terms of cost and those things . What we found with that kind of data is , it doesn’t necessarily tell you where you could make , it tells you the areas to look at but you usually need to do a bit more digging to understand what it is that the data is telling you’ . ( Commissioner interview 15 , Manager ) Interviewees stated they shared data to ‘start conver - sations’ with clinicians and service providers who were unaware their performance was below average , thereby enabling them to develop their own solutions and draw their own conclusions ( CMO 25 ) . The meeting content was similar , except that commissioners aimed to elicit feelings of discomfort and pressure in addition to aware - ness by sharing data : ‘I think sharing the data with them and even if it’s on a one - to - one basis I think that was the most power - ful thing before yeah so I think I think it can some - times the messages can sometimes get lost in all the messages that are out there so I think actually hav - ing very specific data around very specific practices whilst it’s not comfortable I think absolutely does it does get action . ’ ( Commissioner 8 - B , Meeting 8 , agenda item : antibiotic prescribing ) . Combined datasets , i . e . those combining data from different sources , e . g . from primary and secondary care , were perceived as useful , enabling commissioners to gain a fuller understanding of the ‘patient journey’ ( CMO 26 ) . These data facilitated integrated commissioning , and , in the meetings content , were noted to provide assurance that information was comprehensive . Sharing data in a succinct and visually appealing manner such as via dash - boards , infographics , or maps with hotspots increased engagement ( CMO 27 ) : ‘you take a document and it is pulled together by people who really know how to take data and how to set up a document , people look at that and go , “Oooh . ” They’ll make their decisions on , ‘Is it easy to read ? Is it well presented ? Is it a , a glossy docu - ment ? ’… and it’s very visually helpful and to be per - fectly honest to try and get people to understand things , if you can’t put a pretty picture in front of them it just doesn’t work . Give them a table of data and numbers and they will cringe . Give them a pretty picture in a diagram and they’re all happy… ’ ( Commissioner interview 10 , Director , CCG ) . Where commissioners only had access to flawed or imperfect data they understood the limitations of , they still tried to use the data , since they could adapt them in ways that were useful while taking into account the data’s limitations , which was considered better than using no data at all ( CMO 28 ) . Interviewees added that this could make their decisions more defensible . In meetings , this was sometimes also used in a context of having commis - sioning issues that needed to be urgently addressed or when commissioners felt an obligation to use data . Hav - ing a data champion , especially one who was part of the commissioning team , facilitated the usage of data , since the champion could increase engagement and persuade people to use data , and commissioners were more recep - tive to communication about data’s importance if it came from a team member ( CMO 29 ) . Interviewees described using data as a source of evidence to persuade others and justify proposals , due to perception that data were ‘objective’ and could increase the legitimacy of proposals ( CMO 30 ) . In meetings , where commissioners wanted to persuade or reassure others about their commissioning proposals they might stress they were based on data since data were useful for advocating and justifying proposals : ‘This is something that the team have been work - ing through this hasn’t been done just from a management perspective so to give the commit - tee that reassurance : this has very much been driven through looking at the data with partners that we’ve been working with around population health . ’ ( Commissioner 18 – A , Meeting 18 , agenda item : primary care strategic priorities ) . Interviewees were receptive to external support able to offer different or new skills , data , or capacity , perceived as novel and useful , as well as worthwhile financial invest - ment ( CMO 31 ) . Refined CMOs : inhibiting contexts The four refined CMOs related to inhibiting contexts are presented in Table 3 . Data not captured and presented in an interoper - able way with consistent definitions were difficult to use , since commissioners had difficulty drawing conclusions , doubted the data’s credibility , and , in the interviews , had difficulty following the patient’s journey ( CMO Page 8 of 12 Jager et al .

BMC Primary Care ( 2023 ) 24 : 275 32 ) . If commissioners suspected that commissioning data were inaccurate or contradictory , they did not use them due to lack of trust and difficulty drawing conclu - sions ( CMO 33 ) . Interviewees added that they some - times sought alternative sources of evidence , including qualitative information , and feared they might be chal - lenged and therefore lose credibility by using inaccurate data . If interviewees perceived a mismatch between data and clinical experience , this could lead to mistrust and therefore disengagement ( CMO 34 ) . Similarly , in meet - ings , commissioners cast doubt on the accuracy and trustworthiness of some data based on their own clini - cal knowledge as well as knowledge obtained from clini - cians . When subject to financial pressures , commission - ers sometimes made decisions based on little or no data , even at the expense of using data related to potential ( clinical ) improvements , because they felt obliged to pri - oritise financial issues ( CMO 35 ) . Discussion Summary The final programme theory ( showing only the new and refined CMOs ) is shown in Additional file 7 . Facilitating contexts that could likely be easily replicated by policy - makers include the availability of combined datasets , presenting data in a succinct and easily - digestible way , the presence of a data champion , and a perception that external providers offer new skillsets , data or capacity . In terms of specific commissioning activities , commis - sioners used data to identify commissioning priorities based on a belief that data were useful and shared data with clinicians to stimulate improvements with the aim of empowering them and triggering awareness , learn - ing , and discomfort . Other facilitating contexts included commissioners using data as a warrant for convincing or reassuring others about commissioning proposals , or commissioners choosing to use flawed or imperfect data they understood the limitations of in the context of urgently needing to address a commissioning issue . However , the final programme theory also shows that commissioners face a range of barriers to using data , including a lack of capacity , low quality , contradictory and inoperable data , as well as difficult relationships with external providers of data including perceptions that these providers lack NHS specific knowledge and experi - ence . In addition , some commissioners felt obligated to make commissioning decisions without evidence ( includ - ing data ) due to financial and moral obligations . Although there were no contradictory findings across the different content sources , certain CMOs were either only present in only one or two sources , or similar but not identical across different sources . This could be due to a range of reasons , including the Hawthorne Effect , which states that people may alter their behaviour when they know they are being observed : [ 41 ] commissioners , knowing they were being recorded , may not have wanted to make certain statements in meetings . The meeting content was the most recent ( 2020 – 2022 ) , meaning that some CMOs present in the interviews and / or synthe - sis but not the meetings may no longer have been topi - cal . All the meetings took place during the COVID - 19 pandemic , so commissioners were often focussed on responding to the pandemic , potentially at the expense of more ‘typical’ commissioning activities . In addition , due to the ongoing COVID - 19 pandemic , all evidence gathering was remote . Video interviews differ from in - person interviews since they can suffer from poor syn - chronisation , resulting in less fluid conversations , less transmission of nonverbal cues , [ 42 ] meaning interview - ees might have shared more information had we com - pleted in - person interviews . Strengths and limitations The key strengths of this study are its novel contribu - tion to the literature , the large amount of primary data gathered and analysed , as well as the level of agreement between the findings across the three data sources : although not every CMO was ( fully ) present in every source , no CMOs contradicted each other , and there was a reasonable degree of overlap of findings , thereby strengthening the validity and robustness of the findings . This research was conducted remotely during the COVID - 19 pandemic , meaning we could not observe the dynamics of in - person meetings . It was difficult to gauge how reflective the commissioning activities observed in meetings were typical of ‘normal’ practice . Some inter - views were complicated by the challenges inherent to remote working , including slow internet connections , poor phone reception , and interruptions . Comparison with existing literature The findings of non - realist research parallel this study’s findings , concluding that usage of evidence and research in policy - making is a complex , context dependent pro - cess , and that evidence is often underutilised [ 19 , 43 , 44 ] . Mirroring this study’s findings , realist studies have found that a range of individual , interpersonal , and environ - ment contexts influence how research and evidence are used by policy - makers , including relationships between researchers and policy - makers [ 45 – 49 ] . Of these studies , two were realist evaluations on evidence use in systems Page 10 of 12 Jager et al . BMC Primary Care ( 2023 ) 24 : 275 similar to the NHS : a study about a knowledge transla - tion intervention in France , [ 47 ] and a study on evi - dence use in a health impact assessment in Canada [ 48 ] . Although many of the CMOs in these studies bear some similarity to ours , this study focussed on one specific type of evidence ( data ) , leading to the discovery of more detailed CMOs with nuanced outcomes . Uniquely , we have shown that evidence is not used solely as a source of information by commissioners , but also as a tool to effect change and stimulate improvements , as well as a warrant for convincing others and justifying decision - making . Overall , the commissioning of healthcare ser - vices and the related contexts is an understudied topic , [ 1 , 50 ] and we believe have made a new contribution to the literature by applying the analytical lens of a realist evaluation to this topic . Given that the literature on evidence use in commission - ing is largely atheoretical , the substantive theories used to facilitate CMO development had to be sourced from the wider literature , e . g . principal - agent or reference group the - ory . Some of the mechanisms identified in our CMOs reso - nate with these broader theories , suggesting there is some predictability underpinning commissioners’ decisions . Implications for research and practice In 2022 , CCGs were dissolved and Integrated Care Sys - tems , which comprise Integrated Care Boards ( ICBs ) , were formalised as legal entities , with ICBs taking on pri - mary care commissioning [ 51 ] . Future research could test the applicability of our CMOs to these new commission - ing bodies and to a post - pandemic NHS . The relevancy of this research has been confirmed by recent policy initiatives , including the UK government’s 2020 ‘National Data Strategy’ which stated that data could ‘revolutionise the public sector’ by creating bet - ter , cheaper , and more effectively designed services , [ 52 ] and a 2022 policy paper by the Department of Health & Social Care which pledged to use data to ‘to bring ben - efits to all parts of health and social care’ [ 53 ] . In 2023 , the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee launched an inquiry into the collection and analysis of data by the government [ 54 ] . At an interna - tional level , the European Union’s ‘European Health Data Space’ supports the usage of health data for secondary uses including research and policy - making [ 55 ] . Some of the challenges and uncertainties surrounding these new policies parallel those identified in this study , including ensuring policy - makers have the correct skills to analyse data , dealing with a ‘deluge’ of data , ensuring secondary users of data have sufficient trust in data , and providing timely and interoperable data [ 52 – 55 ] . This suggests that using data to inform policy - making is rarely a straightfor - ward process , and that the NHS could monitor develop - ments related to data usage in policy - making both in the UK and abroad to draw on lessons learnt and best prac - tice elsewhere . We conclude by offering several policy recommenda - tions based on the new and refined CMOs ( Table 4 ) : Table 4 Policy recommendations Recommendations Examples of specific activities based on interview and meeting content Informed by CMOs Facilitate integrated commissioning • Provide combined datasets where possible . This could include e . g . combining datasets from primary and secondary care , or combining NHS datasets with data related to inequalities such as housing or income data • Ensure data are aligned with new priorities around integrated care CMO 26 Facilitate relationships with external providers of data • Allow commissioners to work closely with external providers of data ( analysis ) to foster trust and co - production • Involve commissioners in the design , management , and , if possible , procurement of data - driven projects involving external providers CMO 19 , 23 , 31 Encourage commissioners to champion and promote ( new ) data • Designate a data champion internal to the commissioning committee• When introducing new data to commissioners , ask a mem - ber of the committee to introduce them where possible , and ensure commissioners’ potential reservations are taken seriously CMO 21 , 29 Facilitate commissioners’ understanding of data • Distil key data in visually compelling ways • Ensure definitions and coding of data are as consistent as pos - sible , and inform commissioners of any deviations CMO 27 , 32 Page 11 of 12 Jager et al .
