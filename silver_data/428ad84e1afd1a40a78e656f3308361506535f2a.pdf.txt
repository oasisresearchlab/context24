Nascent adhesions typically consist of several tens of integrins , and serve as platforms for the recruitment and activation of proteins to build mature focal adhesions . They are also associated with early stage signalling and the mechanoresponse . Despite their crucial role in sampling the local extracellular matrix , very little is known about the mechanism of their formation . Consequently , there is a strong scientiﬁc activity focused on elucidating the physical and biochemical foundation of their development and function . Precisely the results of this eﬀort will be summarized in this article . 2 Introduction Integrin - mediated adhesion of cells and the associated mechanosensing is of monumental importance for the physiology of nearly any cell type [ 1 ] . It often proceeds through the maturation of nascent adhesions ( NAs ) , which are transient supramolecular assemblies , to focal adhesions ( FAs ) , connecting a cell to the extracellular matrix or another cell . NAs typically contain around 50 integrins [ 2 ] , and show a high turnover rate , with lifetimes of a bit over a minute [ 3 ] . FAs , which arise upon the maturation of NAs by recruitment 1 a r X i v : 2007 . 13368v1 [ q - b i o . S C ] 27 J u l 2020 of numerous proteins to their cytoplasmic tails , form multimolecular integrin adhesion complexes . FAs are establishing the linkage between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton [ 4 ] . However , another cytoskeletal element , microtubules , also play an important role in adhesion and regulate the turnover of adhesion sites [ 5 , 6 ] . While the FAs have been studied extensively in the last decades [ 7 – 12 ] , the smaller characteristic size of ∼ 100 nm diameter make NAs signiﬁcantly more elusive [ 2 ] . Studies of NAs require single molecule localization microscopy ( SMLM ) techniques to image below the diﬀraction limit of conventional light microscopy , and , furthermore , need to account for the short characteristic lifetime of few minutes [ 2 ] . The resulting scarcity of data associated with NAs makes the theoretical modeling very diﬃcult . In our current understanding , the NA formation follows three major steps [ 13 ] . First , integrins activate , going from a state of low to high aﬃnity through a conformational change . This can be induced by binding of activating proteins like talin or kindlin [ 2 , 14 – 18 ] , or by binding to a ligand [ 19 ] . In the second step , the integrins cluster into NAs , which show similar structures on substrates of diﬀerent rigidities [ 2 ] , and are not reliant on myosin II ( MII ) activity [ 3 , 20 , 21 ] . Finally , these clusters are either disassembled , or they mature into FAs and possibly further into ﬁbrillar adhesions . Despite the eﬀorts leading to our current understanding , the determinants of NA formation , turnover , or maturation , as well as their role in mechanosensing and signaling , are far from being fully resolved . However , the past two decades witnessed the emergence of several novel optical imaging techniques , technological advances in protein engineering and mass spectrometry analysis , as well as the expansion of theoretical modeling that now allow the investigation of protein organization of NAs at the nanoscale . Motivated by these perspectives , we here attempted to recapture recent advances in the ﬁeld , while identifying open questions which we believe will be addressed in future research . 3 Integrins as the key players in Nascent Adhesion 3 . 1 Integrin Physiology As their name suggests , integrins are cell adhesion proteins that are integral for numerous physiological functions . Examples include cell gene expression and diﬀerentiation , cell migration during embryonic development , immune response , or wound healing . They sense the mechanical properties of the cell environment and provide signals necessary for cell survival , proliferation , and migration [ 11 , 12 , 22 – 24 ] . Moreover , integrins are a prominent target for medication [ 25 , 26 ] . In humans , this broad range of functionalities is maintained by 24 integrins [ 27 ] built from 18 α - and 8 β - subunits . Several combinations of α and β subunits are possible , as either is not necessarily limited to a single partnered subunit to form a heterodimer [ 28 , 29 ] . They structurally form a headpiece and two legs [ 30 ] . However , only integrins assembled as heterodimers in the endoplasmic reticulum are expressed on the cell surface , the composition of which cannot be reliably predicted by the mRNA expression levels [ 29 ] of integrin subunits . Integrin expression can be regulated by modulating their internalization and recycling , which contributes to the dynamic remodeling of adhesion [ 31 ] . 2 As integrins bind to more than one ligand , the 24 heterodimers are broadly catego - rized by their ligand speciﬁcity into ( i ) Arg - Gly - Asp receptors , binding to ﬁbronectin , ﬁbrinogen , and thrombospondin , ( ii ) laminin receptors , ( iii ) collagen receptors , and ﬁnally ( iv ) leukocyte - speciﬁc receptors binding to diﬀerent cell surface receptors such as intercellular adhesion molecule and some extracellular matrix proteins [ 19 , 32 , 33 ] . Additional ligands relevant in the immunological context are the intercellular adhesion molecules , immunoglobulin superfamily members present on inﬂamed endothelium , and antigen - presenting cells . Besides binding to a wealth of ligands , the speciﬁcity for these interactions is promiscuous , as one integrin binds multiple ligands . Furthermore , it is also extremely redundant , as diﬀerent integrins bind to the same ligand [ 32 ] . These properties of integrins are essential for the interaction with the extracellular matrix and the consequent mechanotransduction . However , they make integrin research challenging at the cellular level . Integrin binding and clustering provokes the formation of multimolecular integrin adhesion complexes recruited to their cytoplasmic tails . The composition of integrin ad - hesion complexes , termed adhesome , have been analysed from cells seeded on ﬁbronectin , using diﬀerent methods [ 34 – 38 ] . This led to the deﬁnition of a ﬁbronectin - induced meta adhesome composed of over 2400 proteins which was further reduced to 60 core proteins , termed consensus adhesome [ 22 ] . Since integrins have no actin binding sites , they rely on a range of so - called adaptor proteins which bind to their cytoplasmic tails of integrins and bridge to the cytoskeleton . There are four potential axes that link integrins to actin , namely ( i ) integrin - linked kinase - particularly interesting new cysteine - histidine rich protein - 1 - kindlin , ( ii ) focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) - paxillin , ( iii ) talin - vinculin and ( iv ) α - actinin - zyxin - vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein [ 4 , 22 , 24 , 39 ] . The consensus adhesome also contains signalling molecules such as kinases , phosphatases , guanine nu - cleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) and GTPases [ 39 ] . Talin , a well - known activator discussed below , also coordinates the microtubule cy - toskeleton at adhesion sites through the interaction with KN motif and kidney ankyrin repeat - containing proteins [ 5 , 6 , 40 , 41 ] , which was shown to stimulate FA turnover [ 42 ] . A lot of detail regarding integrin structure and interactions with adaptor protein is obtained from molecular dynamics simulations , which starting with the seminal works on conformational changes in activation [ 43 ] , addressed integrin unfolding [ 44 ] , diﬀerences in integrin transmembrane domains ( TMDs ) [ 45 ] , talin - integrin interactions also regarding the surrounding lipids [ 46 ] , and interactions with other proteins [ 47 ] . Integrin involvement in pathological conditions is mostly the consequence of changes in the expression , either up - or down - regulation . Prominent examples here are tumorigenesis but also the response to chemo - or radiotherapy [ 11 ] . Therefore , integrin repertoire changes are an active target for drug development in tumours with potential to inhibit metastasis , as well as to overcame resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy . However , despite convincing experimental evidence that demonstrates the capacity of integrin inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies to contribute to inhibition of cancer progression , metastasis , or boost therapeutic eﬀects , no integrin - targeting drugs have been registered as anti - cancer drug [ 11 , 25 , 48 – 51 ] . Integrins are , nonetheless , used as targets in the prevention of blood clots during the opening of blood vessels in the heart [ 52 ] , multiple sclerosis [ 53 ] 3 and CrohnâĂŹs disease [ 54 , 55 ] . Furthermore , since the accumulation of disorganized extracellular matrix is modulated by several integrin heterodimers via activation of latent transforming growth factor - β , the selected integrins are considered as promising therapeu - tic targets for ﬁbrosis [ 56 ] . Besides integrin up - or down - regulation , integrin mutations are also associated with some diseases like junctional epidermolysis bullosa , caused by mutations in either integrin subunit of integrin α 6 β 4 forming hemidesmosomes or integrin α 3 , which pairs with β 1 , forming FAs [ 57 , 58 ] . Furthermore , integrin related diseases may also be caused by impaired activation as observed on platelets and leukocytes [ 59 ] . Integrins are also involved in bacterial [ 60 ] and viral infections , either in attachment or internalisation [ 61 ] , thus representing possible target molecules to combat infectious diseases . Most integrin - related research , nevertheless , involves studies of mature adhesions . The physiological role of NAs is thus typically discussed in the context of the physiology of these superstructures . However , with the recently initiated debate that NAs may themselves act as signaling platforms , new perspectives in targeting NA - associated processes emerges . However , harnessing these possibilities requires detailed knowledge of the sensory role of NAs , their dynamic behavior , and their regulation , which are all still poorly understood . 3 . 2 Integrin Activation Activation is the ﬁrst step in the formation of NAs and is associated both with an integrin aﬃnity change and the binding of integrins to extracellular ligands [ 62 ] . Activation as a term is also used to signify the switch to the extended - open ( EO ) conformation , which is with the bent - closed ( BC ) and the extended - closed states , one of three major integrin conformations [ 63 ] . The changes of conformation may be introduced by thermodynamic ﬂuctuations [ 64 ] , but the switch is often induced by the very association of integrins with ligands , adaptor proteins or Mn 2 + . Generally , each conformation has a speciﬁc aﬃnity for ligands [ 65 ] , although all three conformations may be speciﬁc to one or more ligands . Often though , the activated EO state is the one with the highest binding aﬃnity [ 66 ] . For example , prior to activation , the BC state is the most common conformation of α 5 β 1 in the K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line , making up for around 99 . 76 % of the population [ 66 ] . Simultaneously , the extended - closed and EO states contribute with 0 . 09 % and 0 . 15 % , respectively . However , α 5 β 1 and α 4 β 1 in the EO state have a 4000 – 6000 fold and a 600 – 800 fold higher aﬃnity for a ligand compared to the BC state [ 67 ] . Notably , these aﬃnities are measured for ligands in solution , where they do not induce integrin clustering [ 15 ] . In the environment of the plasma membrane , however , these aﬃnities may change considerably due to the coupling to the membrane [ 68 – 71 ] . Namely , the membrane , by its elasticity and ﬂuctuations can change signiﬁcantly the aﬃnity of a bond , and can induce switches from low to high aﬃnity states , even without changing the actual conformation of the proteins binding the ligands [ 72 , 73 ] . This mechanism of regulation of aﬃnity was originally suggested by theoretical modeling [ 70 ] , and was demonstrated for a variety of membrane associated ligand - receptor pairs [ 71 , 74 ] . However , its relevance for integrin binding remains to be shown explicitly , although it should be particularly relevant for the 4 formation of NAs . Preliminary hints for the role of these mechanism come from mimetic liposome or bilayer model systems . In the absence of adaptor proteins , activation of integrins was here successfully achieved by Mn 2 + [ 75 , 76 ] . The later was necessary to enable binding to Arg - Gly - Asp [ 77 ] , which was however , very sensitive . Mn 2 + , however , may induce integrin conformations that can be diﬀerent from a physiological ones [ 78 ] , which may contribute to the low binding yield , but cannot account for the observed variability of the data . In cellular systems , the activation may be induced by the binding to ligands [ 19 , 79 ] but also by adaptor proteins [ 80 , 81 ] , for example , by talin [ 15 , 16 , 79 ] . Actually , already talin head domain ( THD ) was found to be enough to activate integrins [ 82 ] . Furthermore , THD was found to synergize with the kindlin in integrin activation [ 80 , 83 , 84 ] , which in combination may promote binding to multivalent ligands [ 14 ] . However , there seems to be a competition between talin and kindlin , as the overexpression of kindlin - 1 and kindlin - 2 can both enhance and reduce integrin activation by THD , depending on the integrin type [ 85 ] . In other cases , kindlin overexpression showed only a small eﬀect compared to THD [ 14 , 78 , 81 , 84 , 86 ] . Figure 1 : Current picture of integrin activation and clustering . ( A ) Fluctuations between the closed and open integrin activation state are stabilized by binding of intra - cellular talin , or extracellular ligands . Although kindlin also plays a role , talin shows the strongest eﬀect in stabilizing the open state in early adhesions . ( B ) Initial liganded integrins create a region with increased binding probability , by membrane and glycocalyx deformation . Clustering is further ampliﬁed by mul - tivalent ligands , dimerizing adaptor proteins , established scaﬀolding structures and TMD interactions . Binding of ligands allows for anchoring of integrins and the exertion of forces by the actomyosin network , but also by the ﬂuctuations of the membrane ( Figure 1A ) . The consequence is a dynamic change of the free energy of BC , extended - closed and EO states . The importance of this eﬀect was highlighted in the model of Li and Springer [ 87 ] , who ﬁnd a sigmoidal dependence of activation probability with respect to the applied 5 force , where activation here signiﬁes binding of both ligand and adaptor protein . This resulted in full activation of all integrins over few pN for a wide range of adaptor protein concentrations , permitting a quick response to mechanical stimuli . Comparable behaviour was found in ﬁbroblasts , which reinforce early integrin adhesions ≤ 5 s under load by binding additional integrins [ 88 ] . The response of integrins to force has to be considered also in the context of the catch - bond eﬀect . Namely , unlike slip bonds , which subject to force show an increase in the unbinding rate [ 68 ] , catch bonds are stablized by force [ 69 ] . So far , in the case of integrins , both behaviors were found for diﬀerent force regimes , which lead to the introduction of the term catch - slip bond . The latter was observed for example for α 5 β 1 [ 89 ] , α 4 β 1 [ 90 ] , and α L β 2 [ 91 ] . In the case of α 5 β 1 , catch bond formation seemed to involve the headpiece , but not integrin extension [ 89 ] . Other distinct mechanisms that , similarly to catch bonds , strengthen integrin attach - ments in a force dependent manner are cyclic mechanical reinforcement [ 92 ] , and the so called dynamic catch [ 93 ] . In cyclic mechanical reinforcement , an increase of bond lifetime occurs over several loading - unloading cycles . In dynamic catch , the force response is regulated synergistically by the of binding of an additional co - receptor to form a trimolecular complex with the integrin and the common ligand . In mimetic , actin free systems , cyclic application of force also resulted in bond - strengthening [ 77 ] , which was shown to emerge from a thermodynamic response of the ensemble . Application of a pulling force [ 94 ] induced a regrouping of bonds from sparse conﬁgurations to clusters in which cooperative response is allowed ( strengthening each bond in average ) , and a new thermodynamic state is established [ 77 ] . Interestingly , recent work showed that even in after the links with the cytoskeleton are fully established , most integrins existed in the state of near - mechanical equilibrium [ 95 ] . This complex behavior of integrins is cast into two major activation models , the so - called inside - out , induced by cytoplasmic factors , and the outside - in , where the activation results from binding to extracellular ligands [ 65 ] . However , in the formation of NAs , the time - sequence of binding events is not yet fully established , and it is not clear to what extend the cell relies on either method in order to form such complex structures as NAs . 4 Establishment of Nascent Adhesions and Larger Structures 4 . 1 Formation of Integrin Clusters Clustering of integrins ( Figure 1B ) , with and without the help of adaptor proteins and independent of F - actin [ 15 ] and MII activity [ 3 ] , builds the second step of NA formation . Understanding of this process is greatly facilitated by the emergence of super - resolution microscopy techniques . The latter provide optical images with spatial resolutions below the diﬀraction limit of light of the order of ∼ 100 nm [ 96 ] . Therefore , it should be possible to resolve the dynamic nanoscale organization of NAs and the force transduction across individual components within FAs . However , quantitative investigations of NAs , are still 6 lacking . The main reason is that existing SMLM techniques require cluster analysis tools , which have been developed for relatively simple cases , such as membrane protein clusters without strong heterogeneity in size , shape , and density [ 97 , 98 ] . Several studies have addressed this by designing novel approaches to investigate the inner architecture of NAs and FAs , such as one based on the expectation - maximization of a Gaussian mixtures [ 99 ] . So far , however , various nanoscale distributions have been observed for integrins . Clusters as small as 2 – 3 integrins were reported using electron microscopy [ 100 ] , while clusters observed in SMLM range from tens to hundreds of molecules . Some of the ﬁrst application of SR techniques yielded 100 nm large NAs , containing on average 50 integrins [ 2 ] . This data is contrasted by a more recent work with improved expectation - maximization of a Gaussian mixtures method used on the photoactivated localization microscopy ( PALM ) data , when it was determined that FAs cover areas between 0 . 01 and 1 µ m 2 . Using expectation - maximization of a Gaussian mixtures , localization uncertainties , an important and unavoidable aspect of any SMLM experiment , could be corrected showing that the assemblies contained 10 to 100 localizations , and exhibited strong eccentricities [ 99 ] . Notably , most existing SMLM clustering methods ignored this eﬀect , which can lead to substantial overestimation of the size of identiﬁed localization structures . While the dynamic behavior of NAs is still an open problem , it is nevertheless clear that clusters allow for quick rebinding after bond failure [ 64 , 70 ] , and the control over maturation or disassembly [ 101 ] . Furthermore , clusters could serve as platforms for rigidity sensing [ 102 ] , however , it is still unclear which point in the process of NA assembly corresponds to the onset of signaling . In the absence of detailed microscopy studies , even the necessary conditions for the formation of these meta - stable aggregates are unclear . Some studies report that integrin activation is indispensable for clustering [ 15 ] , promoting the nucleation of new struc - tures [ 16 ] . These results are contrasted by experimental ﬁndings that show both active and inactive integrin nanoclusters in FAs [ 103 ] , obtained using extended state speciﬁc antibodies that co - localized with talin , kindlin - 2 and vinculin . The existence of inactive clusters could suggest the aﬃnity for ligands in the inactive states is suﬃciently large to promote nucleation of domains , although with smaller probability than in the active state . Alternatively , one could conclude that ligand binding is not necessary for clustering , although it is possible that ligand bound states preceded cluster formation . Further scenarios suggest a link between integrin activation and clustering mediated by lateral interactions between tails of TMD [ 100 , 104 , 105 ] . However , limited size of NAs [ 2 , 106 ] requires further regulation of such interactions . Moreover , the necessary activation energy between TMDs also seems too high to overcome without help [ 105 ] . In simulations , fewer integrins cluster when the lateral integrin interactions are weak [ 107 ] . In addition , the TMD could not drive the clustering in Mn 2 + activated integrins , without ligands present [ 15 ] . With mobile ligands , on the other hand , Mn 2 + activated integrins formed small adhesion domains , which signiﬁcantly increased in size if integrins themselves were maintaining lateral mobility prior to the establishment of bonds [ 77 ] . In this case the clustering of bound integrins was mediated by the deformed membrane . The nature and magnitude of these forces could be clearly elucidated [ 108 ] , and were proposed to play an important role 7 in the cluster nucleation and growth [ 70 ] . Given that these types of interactions are not protein speciﬁc , they should also be seen in other binding systems . Indeed , correlations in membrane dynamics and topography with cell spreading reported recently in several studies of cell adhesions [ 109 – 111 ] , and systematically in reconstituted passive systems based on giant unilamellar vesicles [ 112 ] , including those involving integrins [ 75 – 77 ] . However , this mechanism remains to be directly conﬁrmed for integrins in the cellular context . Figure 2 : Diﬀerent theoretical models of NA formation , or parts thereof . ( A ) TMD interactions between neighbouring integrins as well as clustered ligands can cooperatively increase clustering further by guiding close - by integrins to free ligand binding sites [ 113 ] . ( B ) Membrane and glycocalyx deformations can create regions with enhanced binding probabilities , catching diﬀusing free integrins [ 71 ] . ( C ) In a rate equation model of the NA formation , the NA size is deﬁned only by adaptor protein concentration , which are stabilized through present integrins , by reducing their unbinding rates [ 114 ] . The honeycomb grid as well as the hexagonal adaptor proteins shape and size are for visualization only . Most of membrane - related mechanisms include implicitly the existence of the cellular glycocalyx [ 112 , 115 ] , which was indeed found to play an important role in integrin clustering [ 116 ] . The compression and consequent expulsion of glycocalyx , by the formation of the initial bond primes the surroundings for further interactions . Concomitantly the membrane deforms towards the ligand [ 108 ] , creating a microenvironment in which the additional bonds have a much higher likelihood to form [ 71 , 74 ] ( ﬁgure 2B ) . The tension on the bond furthermore increases their lifetimes [ 89 ] , in a synergistic fashion . These eﬀects can be further strengthened by membrane thermal [ 117 ] and active ﬂuctuations [ 118 ] , which adds to the portfolio of forces acting on NAs , the latter being regulators of adhesion formation [ 20 , 87 , 88 ] . While the interplay between these many factors contributing to the NA formation in its early stages is not yet fully understood , there is a consensus that integrin activation increases binding to anchored , clustered ligands . A strong increase in the number of spreading cells was found for a basic pattern of 4 ligands at ∼ 60 nm distance compared to 3 ligands at the same density [ 119 ] . Similar eﬀects are well captured by theoretical 8 works . Simulations can also account for the interplay between diﬀerent integrin types , as demonstrated on the example the competition between ligand binding and clustering of β 1 and β 3 [ 107 ] . Similarly , the eﬀect of closely spaced multivalent ligands was also captured in simulations in which clusters of more than two integrins can form through dimerization , if the interactions are weak [ 113 ] , allowing transient dimer interactions with switching partners . A similar result was conﬁrmed by an agent - based model [ 120 ] , where large agglomerates of ligands provide largest integrin clusters . Besides ligands , a number of adaptor proteins have been involved in cluster forma - tion . The most prominent examples are kindlin [ 2 , 14 ] and talin ( particularly its head domain ) [ 2 , 15 , 16 , 80 ] , that have been already implicated in integrin activation [ 14 , 121 – 123 ] . Their association to integrins then of course promotes binding to ligands and clustering . Furthermore , both kindlin [ 124 , 125 ] and talin [ 126 ] have a capacity for dimer - ization . For example , talin rod , which , using its integrin binding site , can rescue clustering in talin depleted cells [ 2 ] . However , the eﬃciency of talin rod fragments was found to be inferior to the full length talin [ 16 ] . This points to a possible synergy between dimerization and binding the monovalent , and even more so multivalent ligands ( ﬁgure 2A ) . These potentially complex stoichiometries are , however , a challenge for SMLM . Complex photo - physics of interacting ﬂuorophores can lead to over - counting of molecules at a given location [ 127 ] . This complicates the accurate determination of protein stoichiometries from the data . It is , however , possible to estimate the number of labelled - proteins contained in a single cluster [ 128 – 131 ] , but more accurate quantiﬁcations are needed and their accuracy demands further validation . A recently developed supervised machine - learning approach to cluster analysis can be an interesting candidate to cope eﬀectively with NAs sample heterogeneity [ 132 ] . It was successfully applied on data of the C - terminal Src kinase and the adaptor PAG in primary human T cell immunological synapses [ 132 ] , but was not yet tested for talin - integrin complexation or even more generally on NA data . Talin rod has an additional property important for the formation of NAs , namely it possesses a binding site for vinculin . Vinculin is a cytoskeletal protein with binding sites , besides talin , for actin , α - actinin , and lipids and it is usually associated with the force transmission . However , recently it was found that the talin rod domain is available to vinculin in a force - independent manner upon the release of talin autoinhibition [ 133 , 134 ] . This would suggest that vinculin could play a role in NAs even before the cytoskeletal forces are involved . The integration of vinculin could be facilitated by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . This phospholipid regulates talin - integrin interactions at the level of the membrane . Its association with the β 3 units opens a binding site for the integrin on the talin head , hence controlling the talin auto - inhibition . Furthermore , the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interaction with the integrin creates a salt bridge toward the membrane that prevents the close interactions of the α and β subunits . Therefore , the integrin remains in an activated , clustering - competent state [ 15 , 16 , 133 ] . Consistently with these ﬁndings , sequestering of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 diminishes the formation of clusters [ 15 ] . One more protein strongly investigated in the context of integrin - clustering is α - actinin [ 13 ] . It is microﬁlament protein necessary for the attachment of actin . Both positive and negative eﬀects were demonstrated for β 1 and β 3 integrins , respectively [ 47 , 135 ] , 9 which could relate to an integrin crosstalk strategy [ 136 ] . However , its role in clustering is still debated [ 121 ] . This large number of molecular players involved through various interactions poses a signiﬁcant challenge for comprehending the formation of NAs . A promising approach that can address this diversity is theoretical modeling based on rate equations [ 137 – 141 ] . An early attempt focused purely on the talin - PIP2 interaction and is therefore limited in scope [ 142 ] . However , more recently , emulating the formation of entire NAs has been attempted [ 114 ] . In the latter case , a higher emphasis is set on the crosslinking function of adaptor proteins ( ﬁgure 2C ) . The model reproduces some features found in experiments , for example the limited area of NA , even at high integrin density . It also predicts unliganded clusters . Actually , the model deﬁnes NAs as plaques of adaptor proteins and not as integrin clusters . Integrins stabilize the plaque but are not required , which allows for the possibility of preclustering adaptor proteins in the absence of integrins . 4 . 2 Cluster disassembly or maturation Clustering of NAs into FAs or disassembly is the last step in the NA life time . The fate of NAs depends on the cell type , protein composition , and mechanical properties of the substrate [ 8 ] , as well as the attachment to the actin cytoskeleton and both MII isoforms [ 143 ] . Most NAs disassemble when the lamellipodium moves past them [ 3 ] following one of several competing ways of NA disassembly , as discussed in the literature [ 144 ] . Particularly well studied is the role of the non - receptor tyrosine kinase FAK that is known to regulate adhesion disassembly [ 145 ] , possibly through talin proteolysis [ 146 ] . In addition , FAK might be inhibited at the leading edge of the lamellipodium through interactions with Arp2 / 3 , a protein complex that is related to the actin branching [ 147 ] . Because the regulation of rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for ﬁlopodia extension [ 148 ] and lamellipodia formation [ 149 ] , FAK is implicated in the spatial control of the advance of the leading edge and the NA disassembly . This regulation is facilitated by the binding of FAK to paxillin , which is also recruited by kindlin [ 18 , 150 , 151 ] , to further control the adhesion turnover [ 152 , 153 ] . Interestingly enough , vinculin , can impede the FAK - paxillin interaction [ 154 ] , while FAK may play a role in recruiting talin to NA sites [ 146 , 155 ] , as well as Arp2 / 3 [ 146 ] . As FAK also plays an important role in signalling [ 147 ] , it is diﬃcult to unravel the precise dynamical interactions in NAs . Another simple way to dissolve NAs is by oﬀering soluble ligands [ 15 ] . The latter either exhibit a lateral pressure on the NA site or they compete for the integrin upon stochastic unbinding [ 156 ] . Since the 3D aﬃnity of soluble ligands is always larger than the 2D aﬃnity of surface - conﬁned ligands , the cluster becomes unstable . Alternative to disassembling is the sequential maturation of NAs into FAs , and in some cases , to centrally positioned ﬁbrillar adhesions enriched in tensin and integrin α 5 β 1 [ 157 ] . The inhomogeneous structure of these assemblies were observed already over a decade ago using PALM for imaging FA proteins [ 158 ] . Just one year later , Shroﬀ et al . [ 159 ] used dual - color PALM to determine the ultrastructural relationship between diﬀerent pairs of FA proteins . The consensus today is that integrins bind via talin and 10 other adaptor proteins with the actin cytoskeleton , allowing MII generated forces to act on the clusters [ 160 ] . Under force the bonds strengthen , and tilt in the direction of the retrograde actin ﬂow [ 161 ] . The reinforcement of integrin assemblies is further promoted by the recruitment of vinculin [ 162 ] , the crosslinking by myosins [ 163 ] , and the exposure of force - dependent cryptic binding sites [ 164 – 166 ] that allow for the attachment of other adhesome proteins . Finally , through mature adhesions , force is propagated from the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton over the unfolding talin that permits vinculin binding [ 167 ] , resulting in a strong signalling cascade and mechanoresponse along the adhesome , that regulates a number of physiological processes in cells . 5 Challenges and Perspectives in the Field of Nascent Adhesions As presented in the above discussion , many molecular players contributing to the formation of NAs have been identiﬁed , and their mutual interplay have been established , although further investigation of speciﬁc interactions is necessary . For example , very little is known about the crosstalk between integrins of the same and diﬀerent types , recently reported for early adhesions [ 88 , 136 , 168 ] . However , new research avenues in studying molecular interactions in NAs can emerge only from advances in the development of robust quantitative colocalization analysis [ 169 ] . This needs to be accompanied by progress in genome editing and novel protein labelling strategies that could enable quantitative super - resolution microscopy . So far , only very few colocalizations of active integrins with talin and kindlin [ 103 ] and vinculin and talin [ 170 ] could be observed . This can be either a technical issue , associated with protein expression , probe photophysics , and the limited choice of labeling pairs and ﬂuorophores . It could also point to unknown integrin regulators [ 103 ] , and hidden interactions that remain to be revealed . For this purpose , molecular dynamics simulations will become increasingly important as they provide unmatched details in competing binding interactions [ 105 ] . With appropriate level of coarse - graining larger complexes and slower structural changes are becoming within reach of molecular dynamics simulations , which now can explicitly address integrin activation and clustering . Probably , however , the most acute issue is the spatiotemporal evolution of NAs and the role of complex stoichiometries . Namely , the dynamics of NAs is subject of intense debate as the constitutive clusters could be either stationary or showing stochastic transient immobilization [ 103 ] . This problem is very closely related to the sensory capacity of NAs and the onset of signaling , that are equally ununderstood . Resolution of these open questions requires new techniques that can deal with the fast molecular turnover within NAs . However , this is still a signiﬁcant challenge for the single molecule localization microscopy [ 171 ] such as PALM [ 158 ] , stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy [ 172 ] or super - resolution optical ﬂuctuation imaging [ 173 ] ) . First promising insights into the dynamics of NAs , nevertheless were provided by the single particle tracking PALM [ 174 ] , which revealed integrin cycling between free diﬀusion and immobilization , while transient interaction with talins promoted integrin activation and immobilization [ 175 ] . Further 11 studies of integrin dynamics will require techniques such that can operate at micro second - time scales with 1 nm precision of molecules located few nanometers apart . An example of such a method is minimal photon ﬂuxes nanoscopy [ 176 ] , although other approaches are starting to appear and will need to be employed in the research of NAs . Another challenge in studies of NAs is the impact of force . Although not strictly related to actomyosin activity , forces on integrin complexes arise due to the spacial conﬁnement of the molecular players and result in load - dependent competition for binding partners . Diﬀerent sources of forces may play a role in NA formation , prior to their maturation into FAs . Speciﬁcally , the glycocalyx and the membrane are anticipated to generate relatively strong tensions and direct stochastic forces on the individual integrins and the clusters [ 87 , 88 , 116 , 177 ] . The understanding of these eﬀects relies on the development of force sensors [ 95 ] , and techniques which combine the force application with superresolution microscopy . Furthermore , given the intrinsically non - equilibrium and noisy setting , theoretical support in formulating and validating the appropriate hypothesis on the role of conﬁnement is necessary . A particularly useful tool in the research of integrin adhesion so far have been functional - ized substrates [ 75 , 119 , 178 , 179 ] . Manipulation with their stiﬀness , spatial coordination and mobility of binders allowed to provide mechanical cues which could be exploited to resolve the response of diﬀerent cell models . Based on this long standing success , it is expected that patterned substrate will continue to play an important role in studies of NAs . Especially interesting should be their combination with speciﬁcally designed cell models that express diﬀerent types of integrins on the plasma membrane surface . Furthermore , these substrates could be very successfully combined with reconstituted systems . The latter serve as an ideal bridge between the biological complexity and theoretical modeling . Reconstituted systems , typically based on giant lipid vesicles , were instrumental in elucidating the role of mechanical properties of binders , as the role of the receptor and ligand density and mobility in the cell recognition process [ 112 ] . Furthermore , vesicle - substrate adhesion was successfully used to study the physical mechanisms that regulate ligand - receptor binding , including the role of stochastic membrane deformations , ﬂuctuations and composition , as well the steric repulsion role of the glycocalyx [ 177 ] . However , the simplicity of these assemblies may not represent the appropriate biological complexity of NAs . To circumvent that issue , more recently droplet - stabilized giant unil - amellar vesicles were designed that can be sequentially loaded with talin and kindlin [ 180 ] . These systems show great potential for the studies of NAs , and could be used to drive the development and validation of theoretical models and simulations used to describe the growth process . At the current stage , most theoretical models that attempt to capture the formation of NAs account for the molecular complexity of the system , but capture the bio - mechanical context only implicitly , if at all . There is also another class of modes that is capable of resolving the stochastic nature of NA formation and the forces acting on the bonds with relatively high level of detail , but they are nearly void of molecular information . Future eﬀorts are likely to bring closer these two distinct families of approaches , with the aim of providing a more reliable foundation that is required to capture the development of NAs in a predictive manner . 12 Finally , it is a hope that the lessons learned in the studies of NAs may be useful in the context of other integrin - based structures . For example , in hemidesmosomes , linked to the internal keratin intermediate ﬁlament network , α 6 β 4 integrins mediate adhesion of epithelial cells to the underlying basement membrane [ 58 ] . In reticular adhesions , which serve to maintain the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix during mitotic rounding and division , αVβ 5 integrins , clathrin and endocytic adaptors also form adhesive complexes [ 181 – 185 ] . Currently , it is not known whether these diﬀerent types of adhesion have precursor structures analogous to NAs . However , it is highly likely that tools , methods and approaches developed in studies of NAs may prove to be useful in these potentially diﬀerent settings . In closing , we strongly believe that a jointly advances in superresolution microscopy , the development of model systems and technology for manipulations of proteins , as well as theoretical approaches is required to further propel our understanding in molecular mechanisms of integrin organization , stoichiometry and dynamics at the nanoscale . This will not only allow us to rationalize the observed phenomena , but also gain important concepts and tools that can be used to resolve the physiological role of integrin based structures , but can be further applied beyond the NA research .
