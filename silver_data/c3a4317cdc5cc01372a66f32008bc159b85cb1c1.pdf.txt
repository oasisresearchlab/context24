DEARDEN Research Article See No Evil ? Ethics in an Interventionist ICTD Andy Dearden Abstract This article considers some of the ethical questions that arise in conducting interventionist ICTD research , and it examines the ethical advice and guidance that are readily available to researchers . Recent years have seen a growing in - terest from technology researchers in applying their skills to address the needs and aspirations of people in developing regions . In contrast to much previous research in information and communication technologies for development ( ICTD ) that has sought to study and understand processes surrounding tech - nologies , technology researchers are interested in ªnding ways to shape technologies to promote desirable social aims . These interventionist research encounters raise distinct ethical challenges . This article explores the discussions that have been presented in the major ICTD literature and major development studies journals and examines codes of conduct and ethical debates in related ªelds of research . Exploration of this literature shows that the quantity , quality , and detail of advice that directly addresses the issues arising in interventionist ICTD is limited . This article argues that there is an urgent need for the ICTD research community to investigate and debate this subject . 1 . Introduction Professor Kant , leader of the FairBanks project , was making his ªrst visit to the project ªeld site . With a commitment to building capacity by engaging local researchers , Kant had contacted the vice - chancellor of a university in the state capital and arranged to visit before travelling to the ªeld site . The meeting went well , and the VC was particularly enthusias - tic , because his family originated from the area where Kant’s team was working . The next night at the local guesthouse , Kant and Arun , the coordinator from the collaborating NGO , received an unexpected visitor . The town mayor ( a cousin of the VC ) arrived and invited them to attend a festival that evening . Kant was intrigued , and he welcomed a chance to witness a cultural event . He was visibly excited by the invitation and saw possible additional resources . However , Arun excused himself , saying that he needed sleep . It was not possible to explore Arun’s reticence with the mayor present , so Kant accepted the invitation . When he arrived , he was surprised to be presented as the guest of honor , seated on stage with the mayor , receiving gifts and garlands . The next morning , Kant asked Arun about his decision . Arun explained that the NGO had been here for ªve years and wanted to avoid associa - tions with any faction or politician , because it might affect perceptions of their work or hamper their freedom of action . Therefore , they preferred to © 2013 USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism . Published under Creative Commons Attribution - Non Commercial - Share Alike 3 . 0 Unported license .

He was concerned that Kant’s very public presence might have jeopardized this strategy . 1 “We don’t want to work with ‘hit - and - run researchers , ’” was a comment from a development practitioner . If researchers in ICT for development ( ICT4D ) can be said to share an ethic , i . e . , “a set of moral princi - ples , especially ones relating to or afªrming a spec - iªed group , ªeld , or form of conduct” ( Ethic , 2010 ) , then that ethic might include goals of beneªcence , acting in the interests of the people and communi - ties with whom they work , and nonmaleªcence— to “do no harm . ” However , as outsiders in complex social situations , it is often difªcult to identify the harms that might arise from our actions . This problem is compounded by the imbalance in ªnan - cial and social power between typical ICTD research - ers and the people with whom we work . For example , a family offering a visiting researcher a cool drink might be investing half a day’s wages to make the researcher feel welcome . The description of “hit - and - run researchers” above reºects an expe - rience where an NGO felt they had been used to achieve researchers’ objectives , but insensitive actions in the ªeld had damaged the relationships and social standing that the NGO had taken years to build . Because we often work with and on behalf of people who are vulnerable , we must carefully exam - ine our research ethics . However , as a relatively new and interdisciplinary ªeld , we are faced with either a lack of guidance speciªc to ICTD research , or a sur - feit of guidance from different traditions . Individual researchers may ªnd it difªcult to interpret and adapt such guidance for their particular project . This article focuses speciªcally on interventionist ICTD research , a term explored below . In an effort to prompt debate , discussion , and reºection , this article reviews guidance from disciplines related to ICTD and considers implications for ethical interven - tionist ICTD research . 1 . 1 Structure of the Article Section 2 explores the distinction between interven - tionist ICTD research and other types of ICTD research and practice . Section 3 presents a review of the major literature relating to ICTD research and notes the low number of articles that deal with research ethics in the area . Section 4 examines codes of ethics from professional bodies concerned with ICT and explains their collective inadequacy as a guide for research ethics . Section 5 examines a range of ethical issues that interventionist ICTD researchers need to consider , informed by research ethics codes from related disciplines . Section 6 notes the limitations of this study , and section 7 outlines a way forward . 2 . Is Interventionist ICTD Research Different ? ICTD research is multidisciplinary . Development stud - ies itself draws on multiple disciplines , such as geog - raphy , economics , and social science . Further , development can involve specialist areas , such as agriculture , health , education , etc . , with distinctive research traditions . ICTs can contribute in all of these domains . Is there anything different about interventionist ICTD research requiring special con - sideration ? “Non - interventionist” ICTD research may include reporting how people are appropriating and using ICTs ; examining the implications of particular tech - nologies for communities , regions , or countries ; or evaluating ICT interventions by state , civil society , or private sector actors . It is possible to conduct some such research based on secondary data ( e . g . , policy documents and ICT uptake statistics ) , but often , it involves human participants . However , interactions with participants are typically limited to observation , surveys , and discussions . A more recent phenomenon is technical research - ers designing , implementing , and evaluating new technological tools ( and new sociotechnical conªgurations ) as they search for conªgurations that might contribute to development . Technology researchers introduce their own research practices . An interventionist ICTD research project might devise new technology for wireless connectivity in remote regions and conduct ªeld tests themselves or with local people . Testing in situ without involving local residents may avoid some ethical issues , but a key question is whether solutions are usable and sustainable in context . This cannot be answered without involving local residents and organizations 2 Information Technologies & International Development SEE NO EVIL ? 1 . This is a ªctional account of a scenario , based on fact . more actively . Projects such as StoryBank ( Frohlich et al . , 2009 ) , Rural e - Services ( Dearden , Matthews , & Rizvi , 2011 ; Dearden & Rizvi , 2009 ) , MILLEE ( Kam , Kumar , Jain , Mathur , & Canny , 2009 ) , and VoiKiosk ( Agrawal , Kumar , Nanavati , & Rajput , 2010 ) all involve direct intervention by a research team designing and applying technologies in collaboration with people and organizations in developing regions . As Anokwa et al . ( 2009 ) observe , partici - pants’ expectations of what an interventionist ICTD project might deliver may be very different from those of the researchers . There is considerable potential for unintended harm , not least from rais - ing expectations that cannot be met . For this rea - son , interventionist ICTD deserves careful ethical scrutiny . Interventionist ICTD research also differs from ICTD practice . There is a healthy dialogue between practice and research in ICTD , but they differ in the incentives applying to people in different institu - tions . University researchers are ( usually ) evaluated and rewarded for generating research outputs ( e . g . , publications , but also patents and spin - off compa - nies ) . It is easy to imagine scenarios where an ICT researcher’s incentives to adopt a novel approach or technology would conºict with community partici - pants’ interests in solutions that have been tried and tested elsewhere . There are also competing claims for resources . Interventionist ICTD research must bal - ance costs for expensive researchers writing and pre - senting articles against expenditures on ªeld activities . This is not only about personal career goals , but also reºects a sense of responsibility to funders , the wider research community , policy mak - ers , and people elsewhere who may be facing simi - lar challenges . Anokwa et al . ( 2009 ) characterize the relationship between research and development as “a central conºict” and a “dichotomy” ( p . 113 ) . In the next two sections , I review potential sources for ethical advice for interventionist ICTD researchers . 3 . Ethics in ICTD Literature As a ªrst investigation of this area , the scope of this literature review has been set narrowly . The review covers the 10 most - cited ICTD journals as ranked by Heeks ( 2010a ) and the two major series of ICTD - related conferences with proceedings available online at the time of this writing , namely the ICTD conferences from 2007 to 2010 , and the Interna - tional Federation for Information Processing Working Group 9 . 4 conferences from 2007 to 2011 . The ICTD 2006 conference was covered by means of the publication of the best articles in ITID . To set the discussion in context , the review also considers the eight most - cited development studies journals as ranked by Heeks 2 ( 2010b ) . The search was a full text search for the follow - ing strings : ethic , ethical , ethics ( ethic * where wild - cards were accepted ) , research ethic , informed consent , ethic and research method , institutional review board ( or irb ) , ethics committee , ethics review board . Where small numbers of results were returned ( fewer than 20 ) , these were exam - ined , so that book reviews , letters , and articles that mention ethics or consent only in the title of refer - ences were excluded from the counts . Where research method and ethics were mentioned together , the article was examined to identify whether an explicit link was made . Similarly , when irb , ethics committee , or informed consent were mentioned , the article was studied to check if it contained an explicit discussion of research ethics , or if it simply indicated that participants had consented and ethical governance had been applied . The journal search was conducted using the pub - lishers’ standard journal archive sites . Where confer - ence proceedings were available as pdf documents , the documents were searched using Adobe Acrobat Reader . Where conference proceedings were in sep - arate ªles , they were searched using the Google search engine’s advanced search . The Google engine was also used for the archives of the African Journal of Information and Communication . All searches were conducted June 6 – 28 , 2011 . Further veriªca - tion was conducted July 6 – 22 , 2011 . Table 1 shows the ªndings from ICTD journals . 3 Only one article was found containing a discussion of research ethics , and this by authors who self - Volume 9 , Number 2 , ICTD2012 Special Issue 3 DEARDEN 2 . The 9th and 10th most - cited development studies journals according to this ranking are IT for Development and ITID , which were already included in the review . 3 . The sample sizes ( n ) given in Table 1 should be treated as indicative rather than absolute , as they represent the num - ber of objects returned by a search using different search tools . The set of objects indexed varies among journal pub - lishers ( some index book reviews , conference calls , reports , correspondence , etc . ) , and the scope to ªlter the results by identify as students ( Anokwa et al . , 2009 ) . In pre - senting their experiences , these authors also found a paucity of advice . They cite a number of books ( e . g . , Desai & Potter , 2006 ; Devereux & Hoddinott , 1993 ; Scheyvens & Storey , 2003 ) dealing with the ethics of ªeldwork , but they recognize that these texts do not deal with the issues of introducing technologies into the ªeld . Additionally , the authors refer to articles reºecting on ªeld experience from technology projects , but they primarily cite these for guidance on promoting the success of research and sustainability of solutions , as opposed to the ethics of the research encounter . Table 2 presents the ªndings from ICTD confer - ences . The number of articles is small . Two articles were found : One was concerned with informed consent procedures and practices ( Sterling & Rangaswamy , 2010 ) , and another questioned the low input from African scholarship to published ICTD research ( Gitau , Plattiga , & Diga , 2010 ) . A third article included a side comment about a deadlock between a university IRB and a group of schools , each of which refused to approve the research without written conªrmation of approval from the other ( Tewari et al . , 2010 ) . Table 3 presents the ªndings from general devel - opment studies journals . 4 Although the terms ethics or ethical are common , few articles are concerned with research ethics . Many discuss ethical trade . Eth - ics sometimes appears in the titles of references , though not in the main body of the article , and many articles critique the ethics of other develop - ment actors . The articles dealing explicitly with research ethics were an agenda arguing for estab - lishing development ethics ( Crocker , 1991 ) , an editorial reºecting on personal behavior in develop - ment practice ( Chambers , 1997 ) , a discussion of the challenges of researching gender violence in schools ( Leach , 2006 ) , a reºection on participatory methods for compiling national statistics ( Barahona & Levy , 2007 ) , a discussion of tensions in combining qualita - tive and quantitative research ( Kanbur & Shaffer , 2007 ) , a reºexive discussion of ethical issues for a researcher in empirical economics ( Jackson , 2009 ) , and a discussion of feminist epistemologies in devel - opment studies ( Jackson , 2006 ) . Overall , the search found only 11 articles , consis - tent with Anokwa et al . ’s ( 2009 ) observations . No article in the general development studies literature addressed the speciªc issues surrounding interven - tionist ICTD . 4 . Ethical Codes from Elsewhere Given that research ethics debates are rare in the ICTD or development studies literatures , it is valu - able to explore other sources , such as codes of eth - ics . One possible historical starting point is to examine professional codes of ethics . Medicine traces its codes back to the Hippocratic oath ( Hippo - cratic , n . d . ) with its duties of beneªcence , non - maleªcence , conªdentiality , professional probity , and limits of professional competence . Whereas medical ethics begins with a clear duty toward a primary cli - ent ( the patient ) , the task of developing ICT systems involves multiple stakeholders . The major organiza - tions of the computing profession each provide their own ethical codes ( ACM , 1992 ; BCS , 2011 ; IEEE , 1963 ) . The IEEE and ACM have approved a joint code of ethics for software engineering ( ACM & IEEE , 1999 ) , which includes duties to the public , the “client and employer , ” the profession , and col - leagues , as well as various duties of “management . ” However , these codes set out limited duties of beneªcence and nonmaleªcence , focusing primarily on the potential harms that can arise directly from software products . None of these professional codes discuss harms that might arise in exploratory research . It is important to understand the distinctions between codes guiding the delivery of professional services and those speciªc to guiding research . Research introduces extra issues not generally pres - ent in day - to - day professional practice . These dis - tinctions include the following : 1 . Research activities are not ( usually ) initiated at the request of the participants to address their needs , in contrast to the relationship of a client to a professional . 4 Information Technologies & International Development SEE NO EVIL ? object type and date range also varies among publishers . Further , the n value was obtained during the revision process for this article , rather than when the original literature search was conducted , which may introduce still more uncer - tainties . 4 . As with the ªgures in Table 1 , the sample size ªgures found in Table 3 should be understood as indicative , rather than absolute . Volume 9 , Number 2 , ICTD2012 Special Issue 5 DEARDEN Ta b l e 1 .

Research usually means that information is shared with other stakeholders ( e . g . , other researchers , funders , policy makers ) , introducing particular risks of harm and rais - ing issues of autonomy and consent . 3 . Research implies some uncertainty about outcomes , and as such , it demands more careful analysis . 4 . Research should be conducted and reported so as to promote the validity of ªndings that might constrain choices for actions in the ªeld . Various disciplines have established codes for research ethics . The American Sociological Associa - tion ( ASA ) , the American Psychological Association ( APA ) , the British Psychological Society ( BPS ) , the World Medical Association ( WMA ) , and the Ameri - can Educational Research Association ( AERA ) all cover general principles , such as ensuring that par - ticipants in research are protected from harm and providing properly informed consent , 5 but each association’s code has particularities reºecting its particular discipline . In a ªeld that may be closely related to interven - tionist ICTD , the 2nd Community Informatics Research Network Conference 6 ( Cape Town , South Africa , August 23 – 26 , 2005 ) identiªed a need for an ethical code . Averweg and O’Donnell ( 2007 ) developed a ªrst draft , which they published in the Journal of Community Informatics , inviting discus - sion and comment . However , they received little feedback on the draft ( Averweg , personal communi - cation , September 3 , 2012 ) , and the code has not been formally adopted by any institutions . Thus , this code should not be interpreted as a completed effort . An inºuential general framework for understand - ing research ethics was developed by Emanuel , Wendler , and Grady ( 2000 ) at the U . S . National Institutes of Health . The framework sets out seven broad areas of concern that may be applicable across disciplines : favorable risk - beneªt ratio , fair subject selection , respect for potential and enrolled participants , informed consent , validity , value ( social and scientiªc ) , and independent review . The authors later presented an extended version of this frame - work for the speciªc case of health research in developing countries ( Emmanuel , Wendler , Killen , & Grady , 2004 ) , adding a requirement to conduct such research as a collaborative partnership . 5 . Some Challenges In this section , I draw on both the ICTD literature identiªed above and the research ethics codes of related disciplines to highlight some key challenges that interventionist ICTD research ethics needs to consider . To structure the discussion , I draw on Emanuel et al . ’s ( 2000 , 2004 ) framework . 5 . 1 Risks and Beneªts of Research Most disciplines require that research participants should have an opportunity to beneªt from the ªndings of research . For example , the AERA’s code states that “researchers should communicate their ªndings and the practical signiªcance of their research in clear , straightforward , and appropriate language to relevant research populations” ( 2000 , Clause II : B : 10 ) . Averweg and O’Donnell’s ( 2007 ) draft code for community informatics recommends the following : [ T ] he speciªc objectives of any research study should be negotiated with the subject communi - ties so as to include both the objectives of the community and of the CI researchers ; and that the research results should be communicated to the community in ways that meet their needs . ( ibid . , pp . 2 – 3 ) Emphasizing beneªts for research participants may reºect the inºuence of participatory action research traditions on community informatics ( see , e . g . , Bishop & Bruce , 2006 ) . However , similar view - points are expressed in other ( more conservative ) disciplines when dealing with vulnerable groups . For example , the Helsinki Declaration on medical research requires the following : Medical research involving a disadvantaged or vul - nerable population or community is only justiªed if the research is responsive to the health needs Volume 9 , Number 2 , ICTD2012 Special Issue 7 DEARDEN 5 . The APA and BPS codes of ethics admit the possibility of psychologists working with people who are legally incapa - ble of providing informed consent , and the codes discuss appropriate behaviors in these circumstances . 6 . There is clearly some relationship between the ªeld of community informatics and interventionist ICTD research , but any precise description would require careful analysis of the multiple perspectives that exist within each ªeld . A full dis - cussion of the relationship is beyond the scope of this article . and priorities of this population or community and if there is a reasonable likelihood that this population or community stands to beneªt from the results of the research . ( WMA , 2008 , clause 17 ) This is a stronger injunction than simply ensuring that the ªndings are shared or co - owned , or that the research has potential value for people in similar circumstances . Rather , it states that it is not legiti - mate to involve vulnerable people in research unless the particular individuals have a realistic chance of actually receiving the beneªts of the research out - comes . The concern is that risks and beneªts should be fairly shared to avoid exploitation where vulnera - ble people are used as a means toward the researchers’ ( or some other stakeholders’ ) ends . This injunction has sparked considerable debate about health research in developing regions ( Koshi & Nightingale , 2001 ; Shapiro & Meslin , 2001 ) . Consid - er studies of antiretroviral drugs to reduce the rate of mother - to - child HIV transmission . Although treat - ments ( then costing US $ 800 per patient ) were known to be effective in the 1990s , this was unaf - fordable for most people in developing countries , or for their governments , for that matter . Studies aimed to discover whether a lower dosage at cost $ X might be effective for some given X . Glantz , Annas , Grodin , and Mariner ( 1998 ) argue that such studies would only be ethical if , at the start of the study , the researchers presented a clear plan of how the countries involved would be funded to purchase national - scale quantities of the drugs at the spe - ciªed $ X per patient . Glantz et al . elaborate the following : The researchable issue arises from an economic circumstance . The only way such research could offer any beneªt is by “curing” the economic problem . . . Absent knowledge of ªnancial re - sources one might well be creating a new unaf - fordable , and therefore useless , intervention . ( ibid . , pp . 41 – 42 ) On the other hand , the U . S . National Bioethics Advi - sory Commission ( NBAC ) argues that if vulnerable people are excluded completely from research , we “risk developing knowledge that helps only a subset of the population” ( 2001 , p . 4 ) . Bhutta warns that narrow interpretations of the potential beneªts of research might “effectively stop much - needed public health and epidemiological research that often generates precisely the information that might inºuence future public health policy” ( 2002 , p . 116 ) . Bhutta ( 2002 ) further argues for a broader understanding of the beneªts of participating in research , such as possible improvements in local health care systems and build - ing local capacity , for example . For interventionist ICTD research , similar issues arise around whether the technologies investigated will be sustainable in the context where the research is conducted . The falling price of ICTs may encour - age research applying “cutting edge” tools , but Glantz et al . ’s ( 1998 ) argument questions whether vulnerable groups should be encouraged to partici - pate if they cannot immediately afford these tech - nologies from their own resources . Creative uses of lower - cost , lower - tech solutions are easier to justify . In assessing affordability , we should consider who the people are that are being recruited as “subjects” or “participants” in our research . Creating technolo - gies that enhance the capability of established and funded NGOs , private sector businesses , and gov - ernment agencies may involve less risk to vulnerable people than working directly with smaller , commu - nity - based groups or individuals . Established institu - tions might also be better able to assess for themselves the affordability and risk - beneªt trade - offs . 5 . 2 Fair Subject Selection According to Emanuel et al . ( 2000 ) , “fair subject selection requires that the goals of the research , not vulnerability , privilege or other factors unrelated to the purposes of the research , be the primary basis for determining which individuals or groups are recruited” ( p . 2704 ) . The WMA , APA , ASA , AERA , and BPS codes contain little direct discussion of how subjects are selected beyond demands for method - ological validity and injunctions against discrimina - tion . The same is true of Averweg and O’Donnell’s ( 2007 ) draft code . Fairness in selection arises particularly because of the potential beneªts and harms of interventionist research ( in either ICTD or medicine ) . Anokwa et al . ( 2009 ) discuss the tension between working with communities that may be less remote and , there - fore , easier for the researcher to access , versus a desire to share the beneªts of ICT with people who may be more disadvantaged . Ho , Smyth , Kam , and Dearden ( 2009 ) highlight the role of NGOs as “gate - 8 Information Technologies & International Development SEE NO EVIL ? keepers” to research sites , restricting the choices that interventionist ICTD researchers might have when selecting sites . Emanuel et al . ( 2004 ) suggest that working with communities which are better able to both organize themselves in the research and represent their own interests is ethically preferable . In ICTD intervention sites , there has been little discussion about recruitment fairness within studies . Emanuel et al . ( 2004 ) advise that researchers must be aware of the potential within communities for vulnerable individuals to be encouraged by others to take unreasonable risks . Guijt and Khan ( 1998 ) warn of “the myth of community” in participatory research , and Heeks ( 1999 ) explains how nominally “participatory” practices can mask coercive exercises of power . One particular issue is incentives to engage in research . The ASA demands that “ [ s ] ociologists do not offer excessive or inappropriate ªnancial or other inducements . . . particularly when it might coerce participation” ( 2008 , clause 13 . 03 ) . One way to ensure that participants directly beneªt from interventionist ICTD research might be to guarantee sustained ICT funding after the research ends . However , Bhutta ( 2002 ) argues that similar guarantees in medicine can become coercive inducements . Given the high cost of ICTs , coercive incentives may be a particular risk for our ªeld . Sambasivan , Rangaswamy , Toyama , and Nardi report that a “seemingly innocuous gift of a school bag for an informant’s child proved disproportionately valu - able in relation to the family and the community’s income standards” ( 2009 , p . 23 ) . ICTD researchers must consider not only the promises and rewards that they explicitly offer , but also the rewards and inducements that participants ( incorrectly ) project onto them ( Anokwa et al . , 2009 ) . Sterling and Rangaswamy ( 2010 ) recommend that researchers explore the socioeconomic , political , and external factors that are in play in their ªeld site before commencing work . This may help to frame a discussion about levels of compensation , but pro - jects will rarely predict these matters with certainty prior to experience on - site . 5 . 3 Respect for Participants Emanuel et al . ( 2000 , 2004 ) argue that respect for participants underpins such matters as ensuring pri - vacy and conªdentiality , allowing participants to change their minds , informing participants if new risks are identiªed during research , and reporting ªndings to participants . Jackson ( 2009 ) reºects on the relationship between herself as a white profes - sional researcher and members of the community at her research site , highlighting the impossibility of a neutral research relationship with her participants : Foreigners , usually white men , are seen as devel - opment experts associated with projects and in command of budgets , and as worthwhile pa - trons . . . . Researchers are seen as fair game for attempts to guilt trip them into paying for some - thing . ( ibid . , pp . 777 – 778 ) Jackson also recommends a reciprocal research rela - tionship , reºecting substantial respect for her respondents . “Expecting a two - way process in which respondents also evaluate and ‘research’ researchers is a more realistic starting point than assuming ignorance , innocence and passivity” ( ibid . , p . 788 ) . Reºecting these principles , the code for commu - nity informatics suggests that , in establishing pro - jects , “negotiation should include issues such as appropriate ( and inappropriate ) methods , rules for research conduct , ownership of data and the means by which this data may be disseminated and under what conditions” ( Averweg & O’Donnell , 2007 , p . 2 ) . It goes further , requiring that “CI research entails an active involvement by research partici - pants and ensures both that their interests are cen - tral to the project or study and that they will not be treated simply as objects” ( ibid . , p . 2 ) . Such a clear commitment to participatory research and explicit orientation to negotiating the goals of research might be viewed as unnecessarily restrictive for many interventionist ICTD research projects . For example , in ICTD interventions in health systems , the primary participants may be health professionals , but the central interests might belong to patients and users of the services . 5 . 4 Informed Consent The draft code for community informatics suggests the following : [ R ] esearch should commence only if participants have been given the opportunity to give free and informed consent about participation , this free and informed consent has been given and if and as [ sic ] it is maintained throughout their participa - Volume 9 , Number 2 , ICTD2012 Special Issue 9 DEARDEN tion in the research . ( Averweg & O’Donnell , 2007 , p . 2 ) Sterling and Rangaswamy ( 2010 ) discuss informed consent in ICTD research , highlighting the difªculty of translating key ideas . For example , research , investigation , and project ( even when translated into a local language ) will commonly be understood by participants against a background composed almost exclusively of aid and develop - ment projects . Similarly , informed consent forms are rooted in a culture of individual decision making ; these require effort to be translated for cultural set - tings where decisions are treated more socially and collectively . Khanlou and Peter suggest that researchers “envision informed consent as a mutual negotiation process” ( 2005 , p . 2337 ) . Sterling and Rangaswamy ( 2010 ) argue that obtaining informed consent should be seen as an ongoing process that can be improved by stimulating open discussions mediated by local actors , exchanges where participants can actively identify and explore potential beneªts and risks of the research . 5 . 5 Validity Because of the risks in medical research and the cost of research resources , Emanuel et al . ( 2000 ) argue that research is only justiªed if it can be expected to deliver useful knowledge , and as such , that studies should be methodologically sound . Averweg and O’Donnell suggest that “ [ a ] ppropriate research methods must be selected on the basis of informed professional expertise , ” and that “methodology and ªndings must be open for full discussion and peer review” ( 2007 , p . 3 ) . Different ICTD disciplines have different ontological and epistemological roots , and they differ in how they seek validity ( Burrell & Toyama , 2009 ) . All of the codes discuss accuracy of reporting , and Burrell and Toyama ( from their differ - ent standpoints ) concur that transparency about method and data are important . However , unlike medicine , which is ( generally ) approached as a bio - logical phenomenon where realist ontologies and epistemologies predominate , development is a social phenomenon where multiple perspectives interact . In development studies , Kanbur and Shaffer ( 2007 ) explore the implications of the different theo - retical commitments that are typical of , although not inextricably mapped to , quantitative and qualita - tive research . They argue that quantitative methods are usually grounded by a commitment to “brute data , ” viewing knowledge as neutral , but typically treating data categories as unproblematic . On the other hand , qualitative and participatory studies are rooted in traditions such as critical hermeneutics , emphasizing dialogue among stakeholders to estab - lish the meaning of categories ( e . g . , poverty , devel - opment , health , etc . ) and seeking knowledge that can be emancipatory . Important aspects of poverty , such as a lack of respect or dignity , are difªcult to operationalize in quantitative research . Kanbur and Shaffer refer to a study in the Republic of Guinea where women are shown not to suffer from greater poverty based on the quantitative metrics from national household surveys , but where participatory and qualitative data gathering in the same context shows almost universal agreement by participants ( in single - sex groups ) that women are worse off than men . The explanation that participants suggested for the discrepancy was a lack of attention in the quantitative approach to two important factors that disproportionately affect women : lack of decision - making authority and excessive workload . One of the principal questions raised by advocates of partic - ipatory methods in development studies is to ask , “Whose reality counts ? ” ( Chambers , 1997 ) . Choices about how such alternate ªndings are interpreted , understood , and emphasized have signiªcant impli - cations for both policy and assessments of whether the research method generates knowledge that is reliable and useful for development . Crocker ( 1991 ) contests the notion of value neu - trality in science and development , whether quanti - tative or qualitative , 7 pointing out that research requires the allocation of limited resources , and that , therefore , decisions about what to study and what parameters to consider are fundamentally ethical and must be intertwined with choices about the ethics , direction , and aims of development itself . Instead , he draws attention to development activity as a continuum of “theory - practice” : Relatively pure theory is possible . Relatively pure practice is possible . But it is typical and , more im - portantly often desirable to have a “practice - 10 Information Technologies & International Development SEE NO EVIL ? 7 . He also contests the suggestion that technologies are value neutral , a perspective widely acknowledged in ICT . For discussions , see Tavani ( 2011 ) and Wakanuma ( 2011 ) . theory” or a “theory practice” in which more or less abstract thought , site speciªc experience , and practical conduct are dialectically related . ( ibid . , p . 469 ) Crocker refers to feminism as an exemplar of such a “theory - practice” combination , with its aims to develop theories to “understand as well as to end” ( ibid . ) women’s oppression . Jackson ( 2006 , 2009 ) also suggests that feminist perspectives provide use - ful insights for research ethics in development , and Bardzell and Bardzell ( 2011 ) make a similar recom - mendation for socially engaged human - computer interaction research . 5 . 6 Value In health research , Emanuel et al . ( 2004 ) remind us that the quest for scientiªc validity is driven by the goal of generating knowledge that has social value for beneªciaries . However , as Barahona and Levy ( 2007 ) point out , the social value of research in development is not separated from the context . Power relationships between participants and the sponsors or users of research results must be consid - ered . Exploring whether certain research methods will deliver sufªcient social value to be ethically acceptable in a particular context , they note that research which “aims to inºuence policy at a higher level will only impact positively on the lives of the participants if policy makers use them to reduce poverty , increase livelihood opportunities or other - wise beneªt the target populations” ( ibid . , pp . 336 – 337 ) . The question of who holds knowledge and beneªts from the learning generated by research is central to how that knowledge might contribute to development ( van der Velden , 2005 ) . Morton ( 1999 ) , an action researcher in informa - tion systems , warns of the problem of “role contam - ination” between the action researcher as consultant in a problem situation , and the researcher as someone developing knowledge for others outside the situation , highlighting a tension between “detached enquiry” and “help . ” Anokwa et al . ( 2009 ) and Ho et al . ( 2009 ) recognize a similar tension in interventionist ICTD research , but perhaps this is particularly acute precisely because research - ers enter into interventionist ICTD research hoping that their work can have a positive developmental impact . The draft code for community informatics ( Averweg & O’Donnell , 2007 ) offers a possible reso - lution by insisting that both the objectives set for research and the methods selected should be nego - tiated to address both the researchers’ goals and the locally agreed - upon priorities ( p . 2 ) . 5 . 7 Independent ( Ethical ) Review According to Emmanuel et al . ( 2000 ) , independent expert review of research plans is a key mechanism for ensuring ethical behavior , avoiding poor deci - sions , and providing social accountability . ICTD research is often supported by organizations and conducted by researchers with very different geo - graphic , social , and cultural backgrounds from their research participants . In this situation , we can ques - tion how well - equipped ethics committees and IRBs in “developed” countries are to reason out the con - sequences of researchers’ actions or to oversee actions in the ªeld . Averweg and O’Donnell ( 2007 ) emphasize accountability and negotiation with research participants in situ , but they do not discuss expert ethical review . Emanuel et al . ( 2004 ) recom - mend that part of a collaborative partnership in health research in developing countries should be helping local organizations to establish their own systems of independent ethical review . The challenges are further compounded because interventionist technology and design research are usually iterative in nature . This suggests parallels with action research . Khanlou and Peter ( 2005 ) argue that action research plans should be re - reviewed before each action cycle , but they also suggest that the burden of reviewing could be mini - mized by developing specialized guidelines and pro - cedures for ethical review of action research . This might still be regarded as excessive and impractical for much interventionist ICTD research . Gelling and Munn - Giddings ( 2011 ) suggest that ethics commit - tees make case - by - case decisions about whether action research projects should be required to sub - mit successive amendments for each research cycle . Arguably , the changes in risks when exploring suc - cessive design iterations are less than one typically sees in medical research cycles , so more responsive oversight may be appropriate . Morton warns , for action research in information systems , that ethical decisions “will often be nonroutine and made under pressure” ( 1999 , p . 221 ) , and Morton argues that researchers need conceptual tools to support ethical decision making in the ªeld . Ethical interventionist ICTD research may need a combination of these strategies . Volume 9 , Number 2 , ICTD2012 Special Issue 11 DEARDEN 5 . 8 Partnership Emanuel et al . ( 2004 ) recommend that medical research in developing countries should be con - ceived as a collaborative partnership meant to give rise to fair beneªts ( Participants , 2002 ) . Such a part - nership would be characterized by shared responsi - bility for assessing research priorities , planning , and executing the study ; mutual respect for values and culture ( although not uncritical acceptance of oppressive or coercive practices ) ; contributions to local capacity building ; and fair sharing of beneªts . The Canadian Government’s Tri - Council Panel on Research Ethics ( TCPS ) has developed speciªc guide - lines for research with Aboriginal communities , which could be informative for ICTD settings . The initial guidelines encouraged researchers to “con - ceptualize and conduct research with Aboriginal group as a partnership” ( Canadian , 1998 , section 6 ) . The second edition suggests that “ [ i ] n geo - graphic and organizational communities that have local governments or formal leadership , engage - ment prior to the recruitment of participants would normally take the form of review and approval of a research proposal by a designated body” ( Canadian , 2010 , article 9 . 2 ) . The policy also recommends building the com - munity’s own research capacity ( ibid . , article 9 . 13 ) . The TCPS recommendations are reºected in the code for community informatics , which includes a section on Aboriginal communities , recommending that “CI researchers must fully inform the commu - nity leadership or appropriate authorities and obtain prior approval from the community leadership or other appropriate authorities before research can be conducted in the community” ( Averweg & O’Donnell , 2007 , p . 4 ) . In interventionist ICTD research , questions may be asked about which institutions should be recog - nized as legitimate representatives of community interests . For Professor Kant , if the setting was inter - preted as similar to researching in an Aboriginal community , one could argue that the mayor should automatically be consulted to gain approval . How - ever , it might be argued that this would act against the interests of the community’s marginalized peo - ple . Resolving these issues implies making ( explicit or implicit ) decisions about the moral legitimacy and authority of different institutions . For many interven - tionist ICTD projects , local NGOs have been treated as key gatekeepers ( Anokwa et al . , 2009 ; Ho et al . , 2009 ; Sterling & Rangaswamy , 2010 ) . Interventionist ICTD needs to assess the degree to which particular NGOs or institutions have the legitimacy , as well as the organizational capabilities , to represent partici - pants’ interests during research . From a feminist per - spective , interventionist ICTD researchers would beneªt from clarifying their standpoint ( Bardzell & Bardzell , 2011 ) . A pragmatic and participatory dia - logue might suggest that governance should be explicitly conªgured as a partnership among the research team , institutional review boards ( or equiv - alent structures ) , and such locally based institutions as NGOs , community - based organizations , or public bodies . 5 . 9 Reºexivity Emanuel et al . ( 2000 , 2004 ) do not discuss reºexivity in research , nor do Averweg and O’Donnell ( 2007 ) , but most development studies articles that discuss research ethics have some ( explicit or implicit ) reference to reºexivity . Both Leach ( 2006 ) and Jackson ( 2006 ) reºect on their personal roles and behaviors , as well as on how these interact with the reliability and truth criteria of their reports . Anokwa et al . ’s ( 2009 ) article is a structured reºexive survey of the authors’ experi - ences . Sterling and Rangaswamy ( 2010 ) draw both on a survey of other practitioners , and on the authors’ own reºections . Barahona and Levy ( 2007 ) call for more debate and dialogue among research - ers about the impact of their methods , and Crocker ( 1991 ) is disappointed that development profession - als feel uncomfortable engaging in ethical reºection as part of their practice . It may be that reºexivity should be regarded as a core skill required of those who wish to undertake ethical interventionist ICTD research . Chambers ( 1997 ) calls on development profes - sionals to reºect more on their values and how these work in practice . He emphasizes personal behavior and attitudes , claiming that these have more signiªcance in the effectiveness of develop - ment practice than other particular methods do . However , he observes that discussions of these per - sonal orientations “have been absent from most professional training and from most agendas of development” ( p . 1748 ) . 6 . Limitations This review has limitations that should be recog - nized . First , the initial coverage of the review is nar - row . A detailed study of the hundreds of articles in 12 Information Technologies & International Development SEE NO EVIL ? development studies journals that include the string ethic ( but do not mention ICT or other synonyms ) might ªnd more relevant material . For example , Muwanga - Zake ( 2007 ) provides a detailed discus - sion of how the communal values expressed by the concept of Ubuntu framed the ethics of his research , but this paper was not captured during the initial review . Relevant debates may be taking place in specialist ethics journals , such as the Journal of Global Ethics ; Research Ethics ( formerly Research Ethics Review ) ; Science , Technology and Human Values ; etc . On the other hand , an initial keyword search of these journals found no references to the typical acronyms ICT4D or ICTD ; in fact , only one reference to even the broader ICT was found , in the Journal of Global Ethics ( Youngs , 2005 ) . The Interna - tional Review of Information Ethics makes no refer - ence to ICTD , but it did publish the proceedings of the ªrst African Information Ethics Conference ( International Review of Information Ethics , 2007 ) . The journal Ethics and Information Technology recently published a special issue on ICT and the capabilities approach , with articles relating to ICTD ( e . g . , Oosterlaken & van den Hoven , 2011 ) , but not speciªcally relating to research ethics and interven - tionist ICTD . The ªeld of development ethics ( Gasper , 2004 ) may also offer valuable insights . Second , any set of speciªc search terms cannot be guaranteed to capture the full space of debate . For example , Crocker’s ( 1991 ) identiªcation of “the - ory - practice” is closely related to action research , and articles on action research and other participa - tory approaches will probably be relevant to this dis - cussion . This article is not intended as a ªnal word on the ethics of interventionist ICTD ; rather , it is intended to stimulate debate . 7 . A Way Ahead Interventionist ICTD research has signiªcant differ - ences from its non - interventionist partner , and ICTD research differs from ICTD actions driven primarily by pragmatic development goals . This review reveals a disturbing lack of research ethics debate in our community’s formal exchanges . One risk posed by this situation is that , lacking a clear internal debate , a ªeld may be subjected to ethical review standards drawn from elsewhere that may be poorly matched to the speciªc situation and disci - pline ( Singer & Vinson , 2002 ) . Given interventionist ICTD’s need to respond dynamically to complex and changing situations in the ªeld , this is a signiªcant risk . Authors such as Dahlbom and Mathiassen ( 1994 ) and Schwenke ( 2007 ) argue that codes of ethics can be styled differently to serve different purposes , e . g . , regulating and controlling action , articulating shared values , or serving as a methodological framework to promote effective practice . Schwenke suggests that codes of “conduct” emphasizing regulation and constraint can be counterproductive , recommending instead codes of “ethics” that motivate people by appealing “to their aspirations to achieve high moral ideals” ( 2007 , p . 6 , emphasis in original ) . This article opened with the suggestion that ICTD researchers might share some general ethics or val - ues , aspirations , and ideals . Dahlbom and Mathiassen ( 1994 , 1995 ) discuss alternate visions of the computing professional , distinguishing visions that give primacy to engineering ( focusing on tech - nical efªciency ) ; those emphasizing the engineer as a facilitator promoting an understanding of technol - ogy ; and those highlighting engineers as partici - pants in emancipation , concerned with issues of justice . In interventionist ICTD research there may be parallel positions emphasizing dispassionate rigor or technical efªciency ; improved understandings and use of ICT in society ; or viewing development as fundamentally about social change , including changing social and power relationships between people and institutions . As Dahlbom and Mathiassen ( 1995 ) observe , if we recognize these choices over our orientation , then it is naïve to sug - gest simple distinctions between our ethics and our politics . Recognizing that technologies themselves are value - laden ( Tavani , 2011 ; Wakanuma , 2011 ) , interventionist ICTD research must be alert to the ethical implications of technical design choices ( Walton & DeRenzi , 2009 ) , further entwining the process and content of interventionist ICTD research . Exploring these varied perspectives may clarify how different approaches to interventionist ICTD research relate to conceptions of development , and help to uncover areas where the ethics of interventionist ICTD researchers diverge . In considering ethics as contributing to method - ology , it may be helpful to examine other areas of study where relations among ethical , political , and epistemological positions have been debated . Bardzell and Bardzell ( 2011 ) contend that feminist epistemologies and research ethics are highly rele - vant to ICTD . They argue for approaches in which Volume 9 , Number 2 , ICTD2012 Special Issue 13 DEARDEN the experiences and understandings of marginal , rather than dominant , groups are the focus , and where marginal groups are actively engaged in set - ting the scientiªc agenda . As an important contribu - tion from feminism , they highlight standpoint theory , which declares the researcher’s position in the world leading to “limited knowledges that make explicit their positioning , their construction of power , and that seek to make visible the claims of the less powerful” ( ibid . , p . 680 ) . Given the substan - tial feminist literature on development , this may rep - resent a fruitful avenue . I have argued elsewhere for the value of action research to interventionist ICTD research ( Dearden & Rizvi , 2008 , 2009 ) . Morton ( 1999 ) argues that action researchers in information systems need resources to support dynamic ethical decision mak - ing in the ªeld . The same arguments surely apply to interventionist ICTD researchers . A code of ethics ( see Schwenke , 2007 ) would be one resource , which would also be valuable for ethics committees and IRBs , and Awerveg and O’Donnell’s ( 2007 ) work is a useful starting point . However , codes are far from sufªcient . Additional resources should include “sto - ries from the ªeld” ( e . g . , Anokwa et al . , 2009 ) and “microethical” case studies ( see Bittner & Hornecker , 2005 ) . Broad frameworks highlighting relevant dimensions of ethical reasoning ( e . g . , Emanuel et al . , 2000 , 2004 ) and techniques for reasoning about ethics in technology ( Walton & DeRenzi , 2009 ) will also be useful . Meanwhile we should promote more ethical analysis and debate in our core literature . Finally , in promoting ethical interventionist ICTD research , we should consider how our behaviors as a research community impact the actions of ªeld researchers . Some ªelds ( e . g . , medicine ) demand that articles submitted for publication show evi - dence of reºection on ethical issues , or that the work has been subjected to review with appropriate stakeholders . As our ªeld matures , it is timely to consider whether we need such processes . ■ Acknowledgments The ideas in this article have developed over a num - ber of years and are informed by many conversa - tions with colleagues and collaborators .
