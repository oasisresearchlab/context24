REVIEWS THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND COGNITIVE CONTROL Earl K . Miller One of the enduring mysteries of brain function concerns the process of cognitive control . How does complex and seemingly wilful behaviour emerge from interactions between millions of neurons ? This has long been suspected to depend on the prefrontal cortex — the neocortex at the anterior end of the brain — but now we are beginning to uncover its neural basis . Nearly all intended behaviour is learned and so depends on a cognitive system that can acquire and implement the ‘rules of the game’ needed to achieve a given goal in a given situation . Studies indicate that the prefrontal cortex is central in this process . It provides an infrastructure for synthesizing a diverse range of information that lays the foundation for the complex forms of behaviour observed in primates .

We engage in complex and extended behaviours geared towards often far - removed goals . To do so , we have evolved mechanisms that can override or augment reflexive and habitual reactions in order to orchestrate behaviour in accord with our intentions . These mechanisms are commonly referred to as ‘cogni - tive’in nature and their function is to control lower - level sensory , memory and / or motor operations for a common purpose . So cognitive control is essential for what we recognize as intelligent behaviour . Insight into the neural mechanisms for cognitive control may come from what is arguably their most important feature : they are sculpted by experience . Virtually all intended behaviours are learned and so depend on a cognitive system that can acquire the rules of the game — what goals are available and what means can be used to achieve these goals 1 – 4 . Take , for example , dining in a restaurant . We are not born knowing that this can be a rewarding experience or how to act in this situation . Instead , our experiences arm us with expecta - tions about the important sensory information deserv - ing our attention ( for example , the wine list ) , typical events , appropriate actions and expected consequences ( for example , paying the bill ) . This knowledge allows diverse brain processes to be orchestrated along a com - mon internal theme . So a key function of the neural cir - cuitry mediating cognitive control is to extract the goal - relevant features of our experiences for use in future cir - cumstances . It has been proposed that the prefrontal cortex — a neocortical region that finds its greatest elaboration in humans — is centrally involved in this process 4 – 8 . The prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) ( FIG . 1 ) is an intercon - nected set of neocortical areas that have a unique , but overlapping , pattern of connectivity with virtually all sensory neocortical and motor systems and a wide range of subcortical structures 9 – 12 . This provides an ideal infrastructure for synthesizing the diverse range of information needed for complex behaviour . The PFC also has widespread projections back to these sys - tems that may allow it to exert a ‘ TOP - DOWN ’influence on a wide range of brain processes 9 – 12 . Indeed , the effects of PFC damage are most apparent when cognitive con - trol is most needed — when the knowledge about a given situation must be used to select the appropriate goal - directed actions ( BOX 1 ) . Here I review recent neurophisiological studies in monkeys that have explored the neural basis of cogni - tive control . They indicate that a major function of the PFC is to extract information about the regularities across experiences and so impart rules that can be used to guide thought and action 8 , 13 – 15 . © 2000 Macmillan Magazines Ltd Associations , conjunctions and rules GOAL - DIRECTED BEHAVIOUR requires predictions about events , INTERNAL STATES and actions that are likely to achieve a goal . But to make these predictions , we need to form associa - tions between their internal representations 16 . A neural ensemble of a task , then , might be composed of neurons whose activity reflects learned associative relationships between these goal - relevant elements , that is , the TASK CON - TINGENCIES ( BOX 2 ) . Prefrontal neurons do have this proper - ty — they show conjunctive tuning for learned associa - tions between cues , voluntary actions and rewards . Prefrontal neurons even show tuning for complex , behaviour - guiding rules . So they may help form neuron ensembles that represent the regularities across experi - ences that describe the principles needed to achieve a par - ticular goal in a particular situation . For example , the lateral PFC is directly interconnect - ed with higher - order sensory and motor cortex , and indirectly connected ( through the ventromedial PFC ) with LIMBIC STRUCTURES that process ‘internal’information such as reward 9 – 12 . The neural activity in the lateral PFC reflects this — many of its neurons show MULTIMODAL RESPONSES 17 – 22 . Furthermore , the lateral PFC is critical for normal learning of arbitrary associations between sen - sory cues , rewards and voluntary actions 23 – 27 . 8 46 12 9 46 11 13 45 Posterior parietal cortex Auditory cortex Motor structures Medial temporal structures Inferior temporal cortex Figure 1 | Integrative anatomy of the macaque monkey prefrontal cortex . Numbers refer to sub - regions within prefrontal cotex as defined by Brodmann . Different PFC subregions have unique , but overlapping , patterns of connections with other brain regions . For example , the more posterior and dorsal portions of the lateral PFC are more heavily interconnected with cortical areas that emphasize processing of visuospatial and motor information . Ventral and anterior lateral regions are more heavily interconnected with cortical areas that emphasize information about visual form and stimulus identity . The ventral ( orbitofrontal ) PFC is more associated with subcortical structures that process ‘internal’ information such as homeostasis . Above and beyond this regional emphasis , however , there is also multimodal convergence . Many PFC areas receive converging inputs from at least two sensory modalities 94 , 95 and there are ample interconnections between different PFC areas ( illustrated by the purple lines ) that could bring together results from a wide range of brain processes . For simplicity , this figure only shows a subset of PFC areas and a subset of their connections . Areas on the medial surface are not shown or discussed in this review . 60 | OCTOBER 2000 | VOLUME 1 www . nature . com / reviews / neuroscience R E V I E W S Many lateral PFC neurons reflect these learned asso - ciations 18 , 28 , 29 . For example , Watanabe used a set of tasks in which visual and auditory cues signalled , on different trials , whether reward would or would not be deliv - ered 18 , 28 . Most lateral PFC neurons were found to reflect the association between a cue and reward . A given neu - ron might be activated by a cue , but only when it sig - nalled ‘reward’ . In contrast , another neuron might be activated only by a cue that signalled ‘no reward’ . Similarly , we trained monkeys to associate , in different blocks of trials , each of two cue objects with a SACCADE to the right or left 29 , and found that the activity of 44 % of lateral PFC neurons reflected associations between objects and the saccades they instructed ( FIG . 2 ) . Other neurons had activity that reflected the cues or the sac - cades alone , but they were fewer in number . Fuster and colleagues 30 have also shown that PFC neurons can reflect learned associations between visual and auditory stimuli . Striking examples of experience - dependent neural plasticity come from Bichot and Schall’s studies of the frontal eye fields , part of Brodmann’s area 8 that is important for voluntary shifts of gaze . Normally , neu - rons in this area fire selectively to saccade targets appear - ing in certain visual field locations . However , when mon - keys were trained to search for a target defined by a particular visual attribute ( for example , red ) , the neu - rons in the frontal eye fields acquired sensitivity to that attribute 31 . Bichot and Schall 32 trained monkeys to search for a different target every day and found that neurons not only discriminated the current target , but also dis - tracting stimuli that had been a target on the previous day , relative to stimuli that had been targets even earlier . Monkeys were also more likely to make errors in choos - ing that distracting stimulus . It was as if the previous day’s experience left an impression in the brain that influenced neural activity and task performance . But monkeys and humans do more than remember simple contingencies . They can discern the regularities across them to extract general principles or rules . This is reflected in PFC activity as well . White and Wise 21 found that the activity of up to half of PFC neurons depended on whether the monkey was guiding its behaviour by a spatial rule ( a cue’s location indicated where the target would appear ) or an associative rule ( the identity of the cue indicated the target’s location ) . Hoshi et al . 33 found that many PFC neurons were modulated by which rule ( matching shape or location ) the monkey was currently using . We have also observed lateral prefrontal neurons with rule - dependent activity ( BOX 3 ) 34 , 35 . These neurons could correspond to the ‘rule - coding’units in the mod - els of Dehaene and Changeux 13 , 36 . So PFC neurons convey information about the for - mal demands of tasks , a possible foundation for the complex forms of behaviour of primates . The mecha - nisms that guide the formation of these representations are discussed in the next section . Reward signals and rule representations If PFC neural ensembles reflect goal - relevant informa - tion , their construction is probably guided by reward .

They can carry on a conversation , often have normal IQ scores and can perform familiar routines without difficulty . However , despite their good performance on standard neuropsychological tests of perceptual , memory and motor skills , their ability to organize their lives is profoundly impaired . They are impulsive and irresponsible and consequently can have trouble holding a job , remaining married and so on . Careful testing has revealed that the behaviour of humans and monkeys with prefrontal damage can be described as stimulus - bound . Their behaviour is captured by salient sensory cues that reflexively elicit strongly associated actions . They are unable to override these impulses to engage in behaviours that depend on knowledge of a goal and the means to achieve it , that is , behaviours that are weakly established , complex , changing , or that must be extended over time 4 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 86 . For example , consider a classic test of prefrontal impairment , the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task . Subjects are instructed to sort cards according to the shape , colour or number of symbols appearing on them . They start with one rule ( for example , colour ) and , once that is acquired , the experimenter changes the rule ( for example , shape ) without telling the subject . Rules are acquired and changed until all the cards have been sorted using all possible rules . Normal people have little difficulty with this task . In contrast , people with prefrontal damage can learn the first rule but then they are unable to escape it : they make a great deal of errors because they lapse back to the earlier rule 91 . The ability of monkeys with PFC lesions to perform an analogue of this task is also impaired 92 . Shallice and Burgess described patients with damage to the frontal lobes who are able to execute simple routines in which clear sensory cues could elicit a familiar action ( for example , ‘buy a loaf of bread’ ) 93 . However , they were unable to carry out an errand that involved organizing a series of such routines . They would , for example , enter shops that were irrelevant to the errand . In these cases , the basic elements of behaviour are intact but it seems that they are missing the flexibility to shift between different rules and so override PREPOTENT RESPONSES to persist toward a goal . Here , I suggest that the PFC allows for this flexibility by dynamically establishing task - relevant neural pathways in other brain systems ( BOX 2 ) . NATURE REVIEWS | NEUROSCIENCE VOLUME 1 | OCTOBER 2000 | 61 R E V I E W S Reward information does have a pervasive influence on PFC activity — activity in the lateral PFC and ventro - medial PFC conveys the identity and size of expected rewards 18 , 28 , 37 – 39 . A major source of reward - related sig - nals may be the dopamine - mediated innervation of the PFC from a group of cells situated in the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) of the midbrain . VTA neurons have properties that are ideal for pro - viding a signal that guides acquisition of goal - relevant information . Initially , they give a burst of activity to unpredicted rewards 40 , 41 . With experience , they become activated by cues that predict reward and not by the rewards themselves 42 . These neural responses that have been transferred to the cues also wane with further training , perhaps because they transfer to environmen - tal cues that are earlier predictors of reward 43 . VTA neu - rons are also inhibited when an expected reward is withheld 44 . This codes the degree to which a reward , or a cue that predicts reward , is surprising . As the aim of the organism is to predict the means to achieve reward , this ‘prediction error’indicates when the associative learning that underlies this ability should occur 45 . The resulting dopamine influx into the PFC could affect plasticity through several plausible mechanisms . For example , dopamine could augment NMDA ( N - methyl - D - aspartate ) receptor - mediated glutamatergic transmission , which has been directly implicated in plasticity 46 . Dopamine may also help augment and sustain PFC activity 47 , 48 , allowing activity - dependent plasticity mechanisms to work . PREPOTENT RESPONSES Reflexive actions , either innate or well established through a great deal ofexperience . Box 2 | A suggested role for the prefrontal cortex in cognitive control The figure shows processing units representing cues such as sensory inputs , current motivational state , memories and so on ( C1 , C2 and C3 ) ; units representing two voluntary actions ( for example , ‘responses’R1 and R2 ) ; and internal or ‘hidden’ units representing intervening stages of processing . The PFC is shown as being connected to the hidden units because it is interconnected with higher - order ‘association’and premotor cortices , not with primary sensory or motor cortices . A situation in which the PFC seems particularly important is pictured here : when the same cue ( C1 ) could lead to one or another response ( R1 or R2 ) depending on some other item of information ( C2 or C3 ) . For example , if the phone rings ( C1 ) and you are at home ( C2 ) , you answer it ( that is , C1…R1 ) . But if the phone rings ( C1 ) and you are a guest in someone else’s home ( C3 ) , you do not ( C1…R2 ) . During learning , reward signals may strengthen the connections between PFC neurons that process the information that leads to reward , resulting in a pattern of activity that reflects the pattern of associations between goal - relevant information that is unique to each situation ( that is , the task contingencies ) . Once established , a subset of the information ( for example , C1 and C2 ) can activate the entire representation ( for example , the constellation of PFC ‘units’shown in red ) , including information about the appropriate response ( for example , R1 ) . Bias signals from the PFC task representations may then select task - relevant neural pathways in other brain systems ( for example , C1 – R1 ) . A different set of cues ( C1 and C3 ) would activate a different PFC representation ( shown in blue ) and , consequently , a different pattern of bias signals selects a different set of neural pathways ( C1 – R2 ) . By providing a bias signal to the intermediate ( hidden ) units , the PFC favours the pathways in the posterior neocortex and other brain areas that are appropriate for the task . So task - relevant pathways can be dynamically and flexibly established because they depend on the current pattern of PFC activity . A loss of flexibility is a hallmark of PFC damage ( BOX 1 ) .

This may reflect the loss of mecha - nisms for maintaining goal - relevant information , a process known as ‘WORKING MEMORY’ . This has been explored in a variety of neurophysiological studies in monkeys 19 , 20 , 49 – 53 . Many cortical areas seem to have some sort of short - term buffering ability . What sets working memory apart as being more ‘cognitive’is that it can retain information over potentially distracting events . PFC neurons do have this ability . For example , when monkeys are required to sustain the memory of a sample object across a delay period filled with visual distractors that each require attention and processing , sustained activity within the PFC acts to maintain the sample memory 52 . In contrast , sustained activity in extrastriate visual areas seems to be more easily disrupted by the presence of distractors — following presentation of a distractor , neural activity in the INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX and POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX no longer reflected the sample object that the monkey was retaining in memory 52 , 56 , 57 . How does the PFC ‘latch’onto goal - relevant informa - tion and maintain it without disruption ? Several models have been suggested 48 , 58 – 61 . They typically use a form of a gating signal that instructs the network when to main - tain a given activity state . Dopamine influx into the PFC may again be involved . Its neuromodulatory effects could strengthen current representations , protecting them against interference from disruption by irrelevant , distracting information until another dopamine influx reinforces another representation 48 , 59 , 61 . Bias signals and top - down control The ability to sustain task information is of little use unless the PFC can somehow use it to control process - ing in other brain systems . PFC activity could exert a top - down influence by providing an excitatory signal that biases processing in other brain systems towards task - relevant information . To understand how this might work , consider selective visual attention . In the visual system , neurons processing different aspects of the visual scene compete with each other for activation . This is thought to be important for enhancing contrast and separating objects from the background . The neu - rons that ‘win’the competition and remain active are those that incur a higher level of activity . The biased competition model proposes that visual attention exploits this circuitry 62 . In voluntary shifts of attention a competitive advantage is conferred by excitatory signals ( thought to originate from the PFC ) that represent the ‘to be attended’ stimulus . These excitatory signals enhance the activity of neurons in the visual cortex that process that stimulus and , by virtue of the mutual inhi - bition , suppress activity of neurons processing other stimuli . This idea of excitatory bias signals that resolve local competition can be extended from visual attention to cognitive control in general 8 , 63 . Several studies have indicated that the PFC exerts a top - down influence over other neocortical regions . Deactivation of the lateral PFC attenuates the activity of extrastriate neurons to a behaviourally relevant cue 64 , 65 . Tomita et al . 66 showed that top - down signals originating PFC activity elicited by a transient event can be sus - tained for many seconds 19 , 20 , 49 – 53 . This allows PFC neu - rons to form associations between events separated in time 29 , 30 . When the dopamine influx reaches the PFC , it could strengthen connections — associative links — between neurons that were activated by the event that elicited the midbrain dopamine burst and the event that preceded it . Iteration of this process could drive the pro - gressively earlier generation of the dopamine signal from the VTA neurons 54 . During learning , as dopamine arrives progressively earlier , more and more informa - tion could be linked into an increasingly multivariate PFC representation that will ultimately describe the constellation of goal - relevant task features . A possible neural correlate of this phenomenon was observed 29 in an experiment in which we recorded neural activity from the lateral PFC of monkeys learn - ing associations between each of two cue objects and each of two saccadic eye movements . As the monkeys learned , neural activity reflecting the forthcoming sac - cadic response appeared progressively earlier in the trial ( FIG . 3 ) . The initiation of saccade - related activity shifted with learning , from just before the execution of the sac - cade ( and acquisition of reward ) to an earlier point in time , nearly coincident with the cue that instructed the response that led to reward acquisition . Keeping to a task The capacity for PFC neurons to sustain activity is important not only for learning , but also for persisting towards goals . One of the classic signs of PFC damage is increased distractibility : subjects seem unable to focus on a task when other , irrelevant events compete for their WORKING MEMORY The representation ofitems held in consciousness during experiences or after retrieval of memories .

The lines connect the average values obtained when a given object cued one or the other saccade . The error bars show the standard error of the mean . Note that in each case , the neuron’s activity depends on both the cue object and the saccade direction and that the tuning is nonlinear or conjunctive . That is , the level of activity to a given combination of object and saccade cannot be predicted from the neuron’s response to the other combinations . ( Adapted from REF . 29 . ) © 2000 Macmillan Magazines Ltd from the PFC are required to activate ( recall ) a long - term memory stored in the inferior temporal cortex . Other suggestive evidence comes from Miller and Desimone’s 52 , 56 , 67 investigation into the respective roles of the PFC and inferior temporal cortex in working memory . Monkeys were trained to hold a sample object ‘in mind’while they viewed a sequence of objects . They were required to respond when the sample was repeat - ed and to ignore other irrelevant object repetitions . As noted above , sustained activity in the prefrontal , but not inferior temporal , cortex maintained the sample memory across intervening stimuli 52 , 56 . However , many inferior temporal neurons showed an enhancement of their neural responses to the sample repetition but not to irrelevant repetitions 52 , 67 . This indicated that sus - tained activity to the sample in the PFC might have enhanced responses to its repetition in the inferior tem - poral cortex 52 . Box 3 | Task - dependent activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex We trained monkeys to alternate between tasks that used the same cues and responses but three different rules : matching ( delayed matching to sample ) , associative ( conditional visuomotor ) and spatial ( spatial delayed response ) 34 . The first two tasks shared common cue stimuli , but differed in how these cues were used to guide behaviour , whereas the latter two used different cues to instruct the same behaviour . All three required the same motor responses . The associative task required the monkeys to associate a foveally presented cue stimulus with a saccade either to the right or left . The cue – response pairings were reversed within each session in order not to confound the influence of cue stimulus and response direction on neural activity . The object task used the same cue stimuli as the associative task ; however , in this case the monkeys needed only to remember the identity of the cue and then saccade to the test object that matched it . Conversely , the spatial task used small spots of light to explicitly cue a saccade to the right or left and so required the monkeys to simply remember the response direction . We found that over half of lateral PFC neurons were task - dependent . A given neuron might be activated by a cue object during one task ( for example , the associative task ) , but be unresponsive when the same cue appeared under identical sensory conditions during another task ( for example , the object task ) . Also , the baseline activity of many neurons varied with the task — a given neuron might consistently show higher baseline activity whenever the monkey performed the object task , for example . These results indicate that PFC neurons do not simply code a stimulus or forthcoming action . Rather , they also convey their behavioural context , the pattern of associated information that is unique to a particular task . NATURE REVIEWS | NEUROSCIENCE VOLUME 1 | OCTOBER 2000 | 63 R E V I E W S Because task representations in the PFC include dis - parate information , the excitatory signals from this area could be involved in selecting particular sensory inputs ( attention ) , memories ( recall ) or motor outputs ( response selection ) . By simultaneously biasing process - ing in different brain systems towards a common ‘theme’ ( the task ) , the PFC can select the neural path - ways needed to perform the task ( BOX 2 ) . Practice and automaticity The PFC may have a key role in task acquisition , but it is unlikely to be the long - term repository of all task infor - mation . Plasticity is evident throughout the neocortex , even early in sensory processing 68 – 70 . As task - relevant neural pathways in other brain systems are repeatedly selected by PFC bias signals , activity - dependent plastici - ty mechanisms could strengthen and establish them independently of the PFC . When this happens , the PFC may become less involved and the task less taxing on our limited cognitive resources ; that is , its performance becomes automatic . Indeed , PFC damage often impairs new learning while sparing well - practised tasks 71 , and neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies have found greater PFC activation during initial learning with weaker activity to familiar stimuli or during per - formance of well - practised tasks 29 , 72 – 75 . An example is an experiment in which monkeys were required to learn to associate each of two novel cue objects with a saccade to the right or left 29 . They also performed this task with well - practised object – saccade associations — two high - ly familiar cue objects that were used throughout months of training and whose associations with sac - cades had therefore been well established . The average activity across the entire population of 254 lateral pre - frontal neurons studied in this experiment is shown in FIG . 4 . Novel objects that required new associative learn - ing elicited , on average , more activity than the familiar objects for which the associations were already well learned . Weaker responses to familiar stimuli are not unique to the PFC : neurons in the inferior temporal cortex also show this property 76 – 79 . The PFC may remain critical for implementing task information , particularly in situations when familiar behaviours need to be flexibly combined into a coher - ent sequence . In addition , the PFC is required to acti - vate long - term visual memories stored in the temporal lobe 66 , 80 . The PFC could retain links to stored represen - tations that allow it to bring visual memories and other task knowledge ‘online’when needed . Indeed , the PFC does not work alone . It is inter - connected with other structures that make unique contributions to cognition . For example , the hippo - campus seems to bind stimuli into long - term memo - ries of specific episodes 81 : it has neurons that show conjunctive tuning for the co - occurrence of sensory features 82 ( see Eichenbaum , this issue ) . In contrast , I suggest that the PFC represents not specific episodes but the regularities across them that describe task rules . Furthermore , the PFC engenders flexibility . Unlike the hippocampus , which seems to consolidate ‘permanent’ connections in the neocortex , the PFC 800 30 b a 25 10 5 20 15 0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 30 20 25 5 0 15 10 – 5 700 600 500 400 300 200 0 5 L a t e n c y t o h a l f - m a x s e l ec t i v i t y T r i a l n u m b e r S e l ec t i v i t y i n d e x 10 15 Trial number Time 20 25 30 Figure 3 | Change in latency of response - related activity with learning . a | The average degree of saccade - direction selective activity for 64 lateral PFC neurons is shown in this surface plot .

Here , I have extended and modified this idea to include not just recent sensory inputs , but also task contingencies and rules . Such infor - mation must be maintained until the goal at hand is achieved . Maintenance of information is also critical because learning rules typically involves forming associ - ations between disparate events separated in time . Fuster 30 , 86 has emphasized the importance of the PFC in temporal integration and this idea is central to the model I have proposed here . Petrides and Owen have explored the role of the PFC in the monitoring and manipulation of information held ‘in mind’ , an impor - tant cognitive faculty 87 , 88 . The ability of the PFC to flexi - bly form associations in accord with a current goal may be the neural implementation of this capacity . PFC organization could provide important clues to PFC function . One possibility is that different PFC regions conduct qualitatively different operations 87 – 89 . Other possibilities include organization on the basis of stimulus dimension 90 . These schemes are not mutually exclusive . The model proposed here does not address this issue directly , but it does make related claims . I have suggested that the PFC is involved in representing acquired relationships between various pieces of infor - mation , a function essential for intelligent behaviour . This allows for the possibility of a relative regional emphasis of certain stimulus domains or processes , but it also indicates that disparate information cannot be divided into separate PFC modules . Also , the functions I have ascribed to the PFC indicate that learning will be important in the formation of its representations , and hence in its organization . In conclusion , I intended to convey here a general view of the type of mechanisms that might underlie the role of the PFC in cognitive control . Virtually all com - plex behaviour involves constructing relationships between diverse , arbitrary pieces of information that have no intrinsic connection . Insight into the role of the PFC in cognition can surely be gained from a better understanding of this process . dynamically selects among existing pathways . The BASAL GANGLIA and CEREBELLUM are important structures for automating behavioural and cognitive routines , particularly their timing 7 , 83 , 84 . Mechanisms that deter - mine when to exert control are also critical and this may depend on the ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX 85 . Conclusions One of the brain’s great mysteries is cognitive control . How does the brain produce behaviour that seems organized and wilful ? Here , I have reviewed evidence that cognitive control stems from patterns of activity in the PFC that represent goals and the means to achieve them . Bias signals are provided to other brain structures that can flexibly guide the flow of activity along task - rel - evant neural pathways , so establishing appropriate mappings between inputs , internal states and outputs needed to perform a given task . This account of PFC function complements other theories . Goldman - Rakic and colleagues have empha - sized the role of the PFC in holding sensory informa - tion online temporarily through sustained activity 10 .
