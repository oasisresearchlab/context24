Spudich , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , CA , and approved March 7 , 2011 ( received for review December 13 , 2010 ) Giardia intestinalis , a human intestinal parasite and member of what is perhaps the earliest - diverging eukaryotic lineage , contains the most divergent eukaryotic actin identi ﬁ ed to date and is the ﬁ rst eukaryote known to lack all canonical actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) . We sought to investigate the properties and functions of the actin cytoskeleton in Giardia to determine whether Giardia actin ( giActin ) has reduced or conserved roles in core cellular pro - cesses . In vitro polymerization of giActin produced ﬁ laments , in - dicating that this divergent actin is a true ﬁ lament - forming actin . We generated an anti - giActin antibody to localize giActin through - out the cell cycle . GiActin localized to the cortex , nuclei , internal axonemes , and formed C - shaped ﬁ laments along the anterior of the cell and a ﬂ agella - bundling helix . These structures were regu - lated with the cell cycle and in encysting cells giActin was recruited to the Golgi - like cyst wall processing vesicles . Knockdown of giAc - tin demonstrated that giActin functions in cell morphogenesis , membrane traf ﬁ cking , and cytokinesis . Additionally , Giardia con - tains a single G protein , giRac , which affects the Giardia actin cytoskeleton independently of known target ABPs . These results imply that there exist ancestral and perhaps conserved roles for actin in core cellular processes that are independent of canonical ABPs . Of medical signi ﬁ cance , the divergent giActin cytoskeleton is essential and commonly used actin - disrupting drugs do not de - polymerize giActin structures . Therefore , the giActin cytoskeleton is a promising drug target for treating giardiasis , as we predict drugs that interfere with the Giardia actin cytoskeleton will not affect the mammalian host . cytoskeleton evolution | actin proto ﬁ laments | MreB | endocytosis | Rac T he protozoan intestinal parasite Giardia intestinalis is a major cause of waterborne diarrheal disease throughout the world . The lineage containing Giardia has been controversially placed as the earliest to diverge from other eukaryotes ( 1 – 4 , reviewed in ref . 5 ) . The Giardia genome contains homologs of most con - served microtubule cytoskeleton components ; however , it con - tains only a single divergent actin gene ( giActin ) with an average 58 % identity to actin from other species ( 2 , 6 ) . Giardia lacks the core set of actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) , including the ARP2 / 3 complex , formin , myosin , and others previously thought common to all extant eukaryotes ( 2 , 7 , 8 ) . Whether Giardia once pos - sessed the core set of ABPs and lost them or whether it diverged from the eukaryotic lineage before the core set of ABPs evolved remains an open question . In either case , Giardia is the ﬁ rst example of a eukaryote that lacks all canonical ABPs . Here we explore Giardia actin function in the absence of core ABPs . Results GiActin Is a Divergent Filament - Forming Actin . We ﬁ rst explored the structural implications of the high divergence of giActin by mapping the Giardia sequence onto a protomer from the Oda et al . ﬁ brous ( F ) - actin structure ( 9 ) . Of the 155 substitutions be - tween giActin and muscle actin , 48 are highly nonconservative , including six at ﬁ lament contact points involving both the DNaseI loop ( residues 39 – 47 ) and hydrophobic plug ( residues 266 – 269 ) ( Fig . 1 A and B ) . The hydrophobic plug has been implicated in coordinating interactions between three actin subunits ( 10 ) , whereas the DNaseI loop coordinates monomer – monomer con - tacts and contributes to ﬁ lament stability . Point mutations in the hydrophobic plug of conventional actin result in destabilized and aberrant ﬁ laments ( kinks and bends ) ( 11 , 12 ) , and notably , the sequence 266 FIGM 269 in muscle actin is 266 LNNS 269 in giActin . These substitutions in domains important for F - actin function represent major differences between giActin and muscle actin and imply altered ﬁ lament properties . The divergent sequence of giActin called into question whether giActin could form ﬁ laments . To test the ﬁ lament - forming ability of giActin , we puri ﬁ ed giActin and found that the protein could be selectively pelleted under standard ﬁ lament - forming con - ditions . Functional protein selected by cycling between mono - mers and ﬁ laments was analyzed by electron microscopy . GiActin ﬁ laments were shorter and had greater curvature than ﬁ laments formed by rabbit muscle actin ( Fig . 1 C – E and Fig . S1 ) . In addi - tion to conventional ﬁ laments with an approximate width of 7 nm , we observed ﬁ laments with half this diameter , which likely rep - resent proto ﬁ laments and occasionally we observe thinner ﬁ la - ments associating / dissociating from thicker ﬁ laments ( Fig . 1 E ) . Although proto ﬁ laments have not been observed for other eukaryotic actins , they have been observed for the bacterial actin homolog MreB ( 13 , 14 ) . GiActin Forms Discrete Structures . Next , we sought to determine the localization of actin in Giardia cells . Due to the divergence of Giardia , we raised polyclonal antibodies against full - length giActin , obtaining two independent antibodies that recognize identical structures in trophozoites as well as a single band at the expected molecular weight in Giardia cell extracts ( Fig . 2 A ) . The Giardia life cycle consists of two main stages : the ﬂ agellated trophozoite , which colonizes the small intestine , and the in - fectious cyst . Actin localization in Giardia trophozoites revealed enrichment of actin at the cortex , in both nuclei , and in associ - ation with the internal axonemes and ﬂ agella ( Fig . 2 B and C ) .

C - shaped actin ﬁ laments perpendicular to the internal axonemes of the anterior ﬂ agella appeared in associa - tion with the membrane protrusion known as the ventrolateral ﬂ ange , and an unusual helix of actin was observed to envelope the caudal ﬂ agella pair ( Fig . 2 B and C and Movies S1 and S2 and Fig . S2 ) . Using 3D structured illumination light microscopy ( 3D - SIM ) , a new method of super resolution light microcopy ( 18 ) , we found that in addition to the thicker ﬁ laments at the anterior , thin C - shaped ﬁ laments are located all along the pe - riphery of trophozoites , suggesting the ﬁ laments at the anterior are bundled ( Fig . S2 ) . We were also able to resolve a regular zig - zag pattern of actin within the axonemes of the ﬂ agella ( Fig . S2 ) . We observed ﬁ lamentous actin structures within Giardia , and in contrast to previous studies using heterologous antibodies of unknown speci ﬁ city ( 19 , 20 ) , we did not observe pronounced actin staining of the ventral disk , a microtubule structure used for parasite attachment . Actin and tubulin localization were followed throughout the cell cycle and encystation to determine whether giActin formed stage - dependent structures . During mitosis , the anterior , dorsal , and ventral ﬂ agella pairs ( Fig . 2 B ) are repositioned by an un - known mechanism ( 21 , 22 ) . Coincidentally , a cloud of actin was observed around the corresponding internal axonemes . Before axoneme repositioning , the C - shaped actin ﬁ laments normally associated with the anterior ﬂ agella are disassembled and then reassembled after ﬂ agellar repositioning and before cytokinesis proceeds ( Fig . 2 B ) . Cyst formation requires the production and secretion of massive amounts of cyst wall protein ( CWP ) . Giardia does not contain a true Golgi apparatus ; yet , CWP is processed in encystation - speci ﬁ c vesicles ( ESVs ) , where , like in Golgi , cargo proteins undergo delayed secretion to allow for processing ( 23 ) . Interestingly , we found that giActin is associated with ma - ture ESVs , similar to the manner in which actin associates with Golgi in other eukaryotes ( Fig . 2 D ) . Thus , giActin displayed dynamic changes in organization that were regulated in a stage - dependent manner , suggesting Giardia has the ability to regulate ﬁ lament formation . In most eukaryotes the ARP2 / 3 complex is central to regu - lating actin function ( 24 ) . Although components of the ARP2 / 3 complex are not found in Giardia , there are three actin - related proteins ( ARPs ) in the Giardia genome . We performed maxi - mum likelihood phylogenetic analysis on the Giardia ARPs and were unable to group these proteins with any known ARP sub - family .

S3 ) , where actin and the ARPs are thought to have ancient nuclear functions ( 25 ) . Thus , the Giardia ARPs are unlikely involved in extranuclear actin regulation . Others ( 26 ) have reported actin localization in Giardia by phalloidin staining , which appears diffuse throughout the cell and enriched in the median body ( a Giardia - speci ﬁ c microtubule structure ) . Our efforts to stain Giardia trophozoites with ﬂ uo - rescent phalloidin failed to detect any signal above background ( Fig . S4 A ) . In light of the major differences in staining patterns between phalloidin and our Giardia - speci ﬁ c giActin antibodies , we contend that any observed phalloidin staining is background , and phalloidin does not actually recognize giActin . Nevertheless , to test in a controlled manner the ability of phalloidin to rec - ognize giActin , we expressed giActin in mammalian COS - 7 cells and stained the cells with both phalloidin and our anti - giActin antibody . The failure of phalloidin to recognize giActin , and our antibody to recognize metazoan actin , allowed us to differentiate between giActin and mammalian actin . The two proteins did not colocalize within discrete ﬁ laments ( Fig . 3 A ) . Interestingly , giActin did form ring and helix - like structures , consistent with the actin helices observed in trophozoites , suggesting helix for - mation is an innate property of giActin ( Fig . 3 A and Movie S3 ) . In addition , giActin could be observed at ruf ﬂ ed cell edges , reminiscent of a Rac - signaling response ( 27 ) ( Fig . 3 B ) . Consis - tent with Giardia being an early diverging eukaryote , its genome contains a single Rac homolog ( 28 ) and Rac is thought to be the founding member of the Rho family of small G proteins ( 29 ) . To test for a conserved actin - signaling response in Giardia , we constructed a constitutive active Q74L giRac ( equivalent to Q61L Rac1 ) ( 30 ) . Indeed Q74L giRac caused cellular disorga - nization , nuclear missegregation , large vesicle formation , and actin levels to increase ( Fig . 3 C ) . GiActin Functions in Core Cellular Processes Without Core ABPs . Cy - tochalasin and latrunculin have been used previously to probe actin function in Giardia often with con ﬂ icting results ; moreover , in those studies , either no attempt was made to monitor actin distribution during the experiment , or heterologous antibodies ( without controls ) or phalloidin were used ( 20 , 26 , reviewed in ref . 8 ) . We tested the ability of latrunculin B and cytochalasin D to disrupt giActin localization and cellular organization using concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 μ M . However , even after treatment with 100 μ M cytochalasin D for 24 h , only 10 % ( 18 / 178 ) of the treated cells displayed abnormal morphologies ( similar results for latrunculin B ) , whereas the remaining cells had normal actin distributions ( Fig . S4 B ) . The crystal structures of actin bound to cytochalasin D and latrunculin B are solved , so we examined the drug - binding pockets of giActin and found several substitutions consistent with reduced drug ef ﬁ cacy ( 31 , 32 ) ( Fig . S4 C – E ) . Therefore , as an alternative to drug treatment , we knocked down actin expression using translation - blocking morpholinos ( 33 ) . We examined actin levels at 6 , 12 , and 24 h after electro - poration with 100 μ M anti - giActin morpholino or a 5 - bp mis - match control ( Fig . 4 A and B ) . Morphological phenotypes were detectable within 6 h of electroporation , giActin levels were measurably reduced by 12 h , and a maximum knockdown of nearly 80 % was reached after 24 h ( approximately four cell cycles ) . Actin and tubulin staining revealed several defects in the mor - phology of actin knockdown trophozoites ( Fig . 4 C and Fig . S5 ) . Severe defects included gross morphological changes , mis - placement of the ﬂ agella , missegregation of nuclei , and cytoki - nesis defects resulting in cells with 1 nucleus ( wild type has 2 nuclei ) to 10 nuclei ( Fig . 4 C and D ) . Subtle phenotypes included reduced cortical actin and splaying of the caudal ﬂ agella pair , highlighting the structural importance of the actin helix surround - ing the caudal ﬂ agella .

This phenotype was observed in 2 % of the mismatch control population , compared with 40 % in the knockdown population ( Fig . 4 D ) . All of these defects are consistent with actin playing a role in nuclear positioning , axonemal positioning , cell polarity , and cytokinesis . The role of giActin in cytokinesis is perplexing , given that Giardia lacks a contractile ring . One possibility is that giActin contributes to membrane / vesicle traf ﬁ cking , which is essential for cytokinesis in plants and animals ( reviewed in ref . 34 ) . There - fore , we examined the ability of actin knockdown cells to per - form ﬂ uid - phase endocytosis ( Fig . 5 A ) . Twenty - ﬁ ve minutes after the addition of Lucifer yellow , the ﬂ uorescence of the actin knockdown population was 124 ± 8 % ( n = 3 , 10 , 000 cells per experiment , SD ) of the control and increased to 172 ± 20 % after 1 h , indicating that giActin is not required for ﬂ uid - phase en - docytosis . To test whether the increased levels of Lucifer yellow were due to a downstream processing defect , we performed pulse - chase experiments . After a 40 - min chase , 30 . 4 ± 8 . 6 % ( n = 3 , 10 , 000 cells per experiment , SD ) of the actin knockdown cells remained positive for Lucifer yellow , versus 3 . 2 ± 1 % in the control cells ( Fig . S6 ) . This result indicates that actin participates in the clearing , possibly through bulk secretion , but not the up - take of Lucifer yellow . We also tested whether giActin plays a role in receptor - mediated endocytosis . In Giardia , low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) is taken up via a clathrin - dependent pathway ( 35 , 36 ) . As with giActin , inhibition of the Giardia clathrin - mediated endocytosis pathway does not prevent the uptake of ﬂ uid - phase markers ( 36 ) . We analyzed the ability of actin knockdown cells to endo - cytose ﬂ uorescent Bodipy - LDL . We found a 25 . 8 ± 4 . 3 % ( n = 3 , 10 , 000 cells per experiment , SD ) decrease in ﬂ uorescence , in - dicating that giActin plays a role in this clathrin - mediated pro - cess ( Fig . 5 B ) . GiActin Is Required for Cyst Formation . We have shown that giActin is associated with the Golgi - like ESVs ( Fig . 2 D ) , where the traf ﬁ cking of CWP is thought to involve clathrin and dynamin ( 37 ) . To test the role of giActin in CWP traf ﬁ cking , we encysted actin knockdown cultures . Surprisingly , these cultures displayed a 2 . 2 - fold increase in cyst number . Because Giardia encystation can be triggered by lipoprotein deprivation ( 38 ) , the function of actin in LDL uptake is consistent with reduced perception of LDL and the increased encystation ef ﬁ ciency of actin knock - down cultures . To assay the integrity of actin knockdown cysts , we treated encysted cultures with water to lyse any nonencysted cells and then measured cyst wall integrity / viability by staining with trypan blue . Cyst viability was reduced to 17 . 6 ± 2 . 4 % ( n = 3 , SD ) in the actin knockdown population , versus 38 . 8 ± 5 . 1 % for the control , suggesting that giActin indeed plays a role in CWP maturation and / or traf ﬁ cking ( Fig . 5 C ) . Although the reductions in LDL uptake and cyst viability shown in Fig . 5 are statistically signi ﬁ cant ( t test ) , actin silencing is incomplete ( 40 % of knockdown cells have defects , Fig . 4 D ) . Individual cells exhibit varied levels of actin knockdown ; therefore , our quanti ﬁ cation of giActin ’ s contribution to endocytosis and traf ﬁ cking in whole populations is likely an underestimate of its actual contribution . The contrast is apparent in Fig . 5 B , which shows the typical ﬂ uorescence of a morphologically defective knockdown versus a control trophozoite . Discussion G . intestinalis is a divergent eukaryote lacking all core ABPs and possessing the most divergent actin studied to date . Nevertheless , there are other eukaryotes that lack at least some core ABPs . For example , Trichomonas and Cyanidioschyzon lack myosin , whereas the Trypanosomes are missing nucleation - promoting factors , actin cross - linking proteins , and the dynactin complex ( 39 – 41 ) . Spironucleus vortens , a ﬁ sh commensal and a close relative of Giardia ( both of the order Diplomonadida ) , is the only other example of a eukaryote lacking the core set of ABPs . Like Giar - dia , searches for cytoskeletal components within the Spironucleus genome readily identify microtubule cytoskeleton components and actin , yet fail to identify any conserved ABPs ( Table S1 ) . That a closely related and free - living diplomonad also lacks the core set of ABPs suggests that Giardia ’ s divergent actin and lack of ABPs are not simply a result of its parasitic lifestyle . Given the lack of known actin - binding proteins in Giardia , we expected to ﬁ nd reduced or limited functions for actin , yet we have shown that giActin functions in conserved actin - based processes . Table 1 summarizes the actin functions we have identi ﬁ ed and compares the components known to function in these processes in other eukaryotes with those identi ﬁ able in Giardia . Whether the regulation we associate with actin in other eukaryotes was built upon a system like in Giardia or the dip - lomonad actin cytoskeleton was derived from a more canonical one remains unclear . However , the speci ﬁ c recruitment and regulation of giActin throughout the Giardia life cycle argues for the presence of some as - yet - unidenti ﬁ ed regulatory proteins . Intriguingly , the Giardia genome contains a similar number of genes as yeast ; however , many of the Giardia pathways appear to be simpli ﬁ ed in terms of having fewer and more basic compo - nents ( 2 ) . With respect to the actin cytoskeleton , it seems un - likely that the diplomonads would lose all of the actin regulatory proteins used by other eukaryotes and then reinvent mechanisms to recruit actin to core cellular functions . Therefore , we favor the view that the diplomonads never possessed the core set of ABPs . Working out the molecular mechanisms for giActin function in these core cellular processes may provide insight into the 20 60 100 120 40 80 CtrlKD M d n F l o u r e s c e n c e % o f C t r l 2 hr Bodipy - LDL 25 min Lucifer Yellow M d n F l o u r e s c e n c e % o f C t r l CtrlKD 20 60 100 140 40 80 120 Fluid - Phase Pinocytosis Receptor - Mediated Endocytosis Protein Trafficking ( Golgi - like CWP maturation ) Ctrl Ctrl Ctrl L u c i f e r Y e ll o w B o d i p y - L D L g i A c t i n / C W P KD KD KD CtrlKD s t s y C e v i L % 7 d Water Treatment A B C 10 20 30 40 50 * * * * Fig . 5 .

Rac signaling of the actin cytoskeleton appears to be conserved from Giardia to man , but the ABPs currently known to link Rac to actin are not found in Giardia . The response of giActin to Rac signaling in Giardia and the localization of giActin to ruf ﬂ ed cell edges of transgenic COS - 7 cells , suggest the existence of a con - served Rac - signaling mechanism in Giardia that may also be functioning in mammalian cells . Because small G protein signaling is simpler in Giardia ( i . e . , there is no Rho or CDC42 and only 3 Rho Gap proteins versus over 70 in mammalian cells ) ( 42 ) , it may be easier to work out the fundamental principles of G protein signaling in Giardia than in more complex systems . Membrane / vesicle traf ﬁ cking is another area where studying basic cell biology in Giardia could lead to the discovery of key universal requirements . We have shown that actin is involved in the traf ﬁ cking of CWP , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and cyto - kinesis that is likely mediated by traf ﬁ cking . There are differing requirements for actin in endocytosis between eukaryotes as close as yeast and man ( 43 ) ; however , even in Giardia , there is a role for actin in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Although the list of com - ponents differs between yeast and mammalian systems ( 44 ) , there are some common components , whereas Giardia has almost none of these proteins ( Table 1 ) . Therefore , studying such processes in a simpli ﬁ ed system like Giardia can help de ﬁ ne what is at the core of these processes in terms of basic mechanistic requirements . Regardless of whether the actin regulatory proteins are con - served in all eukaryotes or are Giardia speci ﬁ c , their identi ﬁ ca - tion will provide evolutionary insight and possibly novel modes of actin regulation . Thus , far , our homology searches have only identi ﬁ ed the actin - binding proteins P28 / IDA4 and centrin , which are components of the inner dynein arm of ﬂ agella ( 17 ) . These proteins are thought to bind monomeric actin in a complex rather than regulate actin dynamics ; however , their conservation in ﬂ agellates from Giardia to man indicates that actin function in the ﬂ agella is ancestral ( Fig . S2 ) . The function of giActin in other essential cellular processes predicts divergent or novel actin regulators , making the actin cytoskeleton a promising drug target , as we predict some drugs that interfere with the Giardia actin cytoskeleton will not affect the mammalian host . Our observation that giActin forms proto ﬁ laments and helical structures like the bacterial homolog of actin , MreB , may have evolutionary impli - cations ( 45 ) . If Giardia truly belongs to the earliest diverging eukaryotic lineage , perhaps giActin and its predicted novel ABPs represent evolutionary intermediates . Only by identifying giActin interactors and analyzing the genomes of additional diverse spe - cies , will we gain further insight into the evolution of the actin cytoskeleton .
