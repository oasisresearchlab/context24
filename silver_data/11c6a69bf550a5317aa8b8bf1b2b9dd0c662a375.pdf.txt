The presence of nuclear actin was elusive for a very long time . Now , there is a very strong evidence that actin plays many important roles in the nucleus . Here , we discuss the recently discovered functions of the nuclear actin pool . Actin does not have nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) , so its import to the nucleus is facilitated by the NLS - containing proteins . Nuclear actin plays a role in the maintenance of the nuclear structure and the nuclear envelope breakdown . It is also involved in chromatin remodeling , and chromatin and nucleosome movement necessary for DNA recombination , repair , and the initiation of transcription . It also binds RNA polymerases , promoting transcription . Because of the multifaceted role of nuclear actin , the future challenge will be to further deﬁne its functions in various cellular processes and diseases . Abstract : Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells . There are different pools of nuclear actin often undetectable by conventional staining and commercial antibodies used to identify cytoplasmic actin . With the development of more sophisticated imaging and analytical techniques , it became clear that nuclear actin plays a crucial role in shaping the chromatin , genomic , and epigenetic landscape , transcriptional regulation , and DNA repair . This multifaceted role of nuclear actin is not only important for the function of the individual cell but also for the establishment of cell fate , and tissue and organ differentiation during development . Moreover , the changes in the nuclear , chromatin , and genomic architecture are preamble to various diseases . Here , we discuss some of the newly described functions of nuclear actin . Keywords : nuclear actin ; nuclear architecture ; intranuclear rods ; RhoA ; F actin ; G actin ; chro - matin remodeling 1 . Introduction Nuclear actin was ﬁrst described in bovine thymus cells [ 1 , 2 ] , two different slime molds [ 3 , 4 ] , Xenopus frog and newt Triturus oocytes [ 5 – 7 ] , and liver cells [ 8 ] . However , these ﬁndings met with disbelieve and criticism [ 9 ] , and after decades of skepticism and denial , ﬁnally around ten years ago , main - stream science not only accepted the existence of nuclear actin but appreciated its importance in the regulation of structure , function , homeostasis , and health of eukaryotic cells [ 10 ] . One of the reasons for the denial of nuclear actin existence was due to an inability to visualize nuclear actin using conventional phalloidin or antibody staining . Actin has three main polymerization states , monomeric ( globular ) G - actin , oligomeric , and polymeric Biology 2021 , 10 , 304 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / biology10040304 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / biology Biology 2021 , 10 , 304 2 of 14 ( filamentous ) F - actin . While the cytoplasmic actin is mainly monomeric or polymeric , nuclear actin is either monomeric , dimeric , oligomeric , or may adopt some other unusual conformations [ 11 – 14 ] . Nuclear actin oligomers , which cannot be stained by phalloidin , are often recognized by specific antibodies , such as the 2G2 antibody . This antibody recognizes the epitope composed of three nonsequential regions ( aa131 – 139 , aa155 – 169 , and aa176 – 187 ) located in the vicinity of the nucleotide - binding region [ 15 ] . This indicates that nuclear actin adopts a specific conformation , absent in the cytoplasmic F - actin , which compacts these three separate regions into a single antibody - recognizable epitope [ 15 , 16 ] . Recent studies indicate that different antibodies recognize different pools of nuclear actin , with different conformation , and different locations within the nucleus , suggesting different functions [ 17 ] . Although our knowledge about the conformations adopted by nuclear actin is still very limited , there is a lot of information about the structural and functional roles of nuclear actin . We describe the role of intranuclear actin network and nuclear actin rods , and the role of nuclear actin in nuclear envelope breakdown , chromatin organization and remodeling , and transcription . For the description of the other roles of nuclear actin , such as apoptosis [ 18 ] , viral infection [ 19 ] , structure of nuclear membrane [ 20 – 23 ] , we direct readers to the cited above papers . 2 . Role of Intranuclear Actin Network The presence of intranuclear actin monomers ( unpolymerized G - actin ) has been con - firmed by many studies . The monomeric G actin constantly shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm . The Importin 9 protein imports G actin into the nucleus and the Exportin 6 protein mediates actin export to the cytoplasm [ 24 , 25 ] . These proteins function with the participation of the small GTPase Ran [ 25 – 29 ] . During the nuclear import , the GTP - bound Ran detaches cargo from the importin and returns importin to the cytoplasm . During the nuclear export , the nuclear GTP - bound Ran aggregates with exportin and cargo . This trimeric complex moves to the cytoplasm , where the hydrolysis of Ran GTP to Ran GDP results in the release of the cargo [ 29 , 30 ] . The presence of F - actin in the nucleus is based on indirect and direct evidence . The indirect evidence includes studies showing that Fragmin , which restricts the polymerization of actin filaments , inhibits transcription of salamander lampbrush chromosomes , and the antibodies against nuclear motor protein myosin - I , which binds the barbed end of actin filaments , inhibit the transcription [ 16 , 31 ] . Among the direct evidence are studies showing a transient presence of F - actin in the nuclei of fibroblasts [ 32 ] , fibrosarcoma cells [ 33 ] , breast epithelial [ 34 ] , and early embryonic mouse cells [ 35 ] . Studies also show that during the exit from the mitotic division , the F - actin forms in the nuclei of the daughter cells , where it promotes enlargement of the nucleus , chromatin decondensation , and the formation of nuclear protrusions [ 32 ] . The polymerization of nuclear F - actin fila - ments was also observed during cell spreading and stimulation by fibronectin via interaction with the extracellular matrix [ 36 ] . Among the proteins which regulate actin is cofilin , which accelerates actin filament polymerization / depolymerization dynamics [ 37 ] . Cofilin severs actin filaments and increases the number of free ends to which actin monomers can be added or removed [ 37 ] . Another protein is the actin - monomer - binding protein profilin , which is necessary for the formation of actin cables [ 38 ] , and fascin , which is required for actin filament bundling [ 39 ] . During the stress , cofilin is actively imported into the nucleus using its nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) . Cofilin NLS is importin - α / β - dependent . The interaction of cofilin NLS with the adapter protein importin α and nuclear transport protein importin β transports cofilin through the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) into the nucleus . The directionality of the transport and cofilin release in the nucleus is regulated by the GTP - binding nuclear protein Ran ( Figure 1 ) . Cofilin also plays a role in the import of actin into the nucleus [ 40 – 42 ] . Actin does not have NLS in its sequence , but interest - ingly , Wada et al . [ 43 ] identified in actin’s sequence two nuclear export signals ( NES1 and NES2 ) [ 43 ] . Thus , actin entry into the nucleus has to be facilitated by the proteins containing NLS , such as cofilin [ 42 ] . The export of nuclear actin is facilitated by the Exportin 6 and the actin - binding protein Profilin ( Figure 1 ) [ 20 , 25 , 44 ] . Many studies have shown that , in con - Biology 2021 , 10 , 304 3 of 14 trast to the cytoplasm , the intranuclear actin does not form long F - actin filaments but short oligomeric filaments . This is possibly to prevent interference with the chromatin [ 45 – 47 ] or prevent inhibition of transcription [ 48 ] . The field emission scanning electron microscopy ( feSEM ) studies of Xenopus oocytes [ 47 ] showed that the nucleus contains a network of short but highly branched , forked , and bundled actin filaments , which are connected to the nuclear pore complexes at one end , and the subnuclear organelles such as Cajal bodies and snurposomes ( both involved in the assembly of ribonucleoproteins and mRNA pro - cessing ) , and nucleoli , at the other end . These nuclear pore - linked filaments ( PLFs ) are 12 – 100 nm diameter and contain actin , and actin - scaffolding protein 4 . 1 . Because a single actin filament is 8 – 9 nm in diameter , the intranuclear filaments must also contain other bounds or transiently interacting proteins of unknown identity . The probable candidates could be the actin - interacting proteins identified in the nuclei of Drosophila and human cells , such as the ubiquitous protein EAST , the α - actinin - like actin - binding domain - containing protein NUANCE , and the nucleoporins [ 47 , 49 , 50 ] . Interestingly , in Xenopus oocyte nuclei , protein 4 . 1 is regularly spaced on the filaments at ~ 120 nm intervals , and the pairs of protein 4 . 1 - containing speckles are present at the filament forks [ 47 , 51 ] . Besides Xenopus , the pres - ence of protein 4 . 1 on the intranuclear filaments was also observed in the nuclei of human fibroblasts [ 47 ] . In human erythrocytes , the protein 4 . 1 , also known as the Beatty’s Protein , regulates the stability of the erythrocyte membrane through its interaction with the short actin filaments and spectrin [ 52 ] . It seems that some of the functions of intranuclear actin filaments could be the facilitation of intranuclear transport between the nuclear pores and subnuclear organelles , and a displacement of the membrane - underlying chromatin to form the chromatin - free spaces under the nuclear pores , which will facilitate the transport of the molecules [ 47 , 53 ] . Some of the existing techniques of actin visualization in live cells involve the tagging of actin with fluorescent proteins or the expression of GFP - actin [ 54 ] . However , the comprehensive analysis of nuclear actin functions will require the development of novel , super - resolution imaging techniques . Recently developed multiplexed super - resolution volumetric imaging and expansion microscopy ( ExM ) enable visualization of nanoscale details of actin filament organization [ 55 ] . Figure 1 . Nuclear actin shuttling and actin rode formation . Actin monomers in the cytoplasm form a complex with coﬁlin and importin 9 . The complex is imported into the nucleus , where actin is released , and the importin is cycled back to the cytoplasm . The monomeric nuclear actin can form oligomers , polymers , or actin rods . The export of the actin from the nucleus is facilitated by the proﬁlin and exportin 6 . While in the cytoplasm , exportin is recycled back into the nucleus . This process depends on the balance between nuclear and cytoplasmic Ran GTP / GDP . Ran GTP promotes nuclear export and Ran GDP promotes nuclear import . Biology 2021 , 10 , 304 4 of 14 3 . Enigmatic Role of Intranuclear Actin Rods Actin rods are several µ m - long aggregates of actin ﬁlaments and actin - interacting proteins [ 56 , 57 ] . Because they form in the nucleus and / or cytoplasm in response to mechanical or chemical / environmental stress ( heat shock , hypoxia , pathogens , toxin , drugs ) , the actin rods are the marker of the so - called Actin Stress Response ( ASR ) that correlates with many human diseases . The intranuclear rods were ﬁrst discovered around 1980 in the dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) - stressed Dictyostelium amoeba , human HeLa , and fetal lung WI - 38 cells , and rat kangaroo kidney epithelial PtK2 cells [ 58 , 59 ] . Although the function of the intranuclear rods is not clear , it seems that they may act as a protective mechanism by eliminating actin - treadmilling and , thus , frees up ATP that can be utilized for the immediate needs of stressed cells [ 56 , 60 , 61 ] . Several actin - interacting proteins have been identiﬁed in the intranuclear rods [ 56 ] . One of these proteins is Coﬁlin , which in the nuclear rods of some , but not all cells , binds the whole length of actin ﬁlaments , which makes the rods undetectable by a routine actin staining by phalloidin [ 62 ] . Studies on Drosophila heat shock model showed that the formation of intranuclear actin rods requires an increase in the nuclear pool of free actin and a heat - induced increase in the activity of coﬁlin [ 63 , 64 ] . Studies on the nuclear rod formation in Drosophila ovaries showed that coﬁlin is regulated by nuclear actin - bundling protein fascin [ 65 ] . Another protein present in the actin rods is the Actin - interacting protein 1 ( Aip1 ) , a WD repeat - containing protein that facilitates the disassembly of actin ﬁlaments [ 66 ] . Other proteins are the actin - binding protein Coronin ( CorA ) , which also belongs to the WD - repeat family of proteins and is involved in actin cytoskeleton organization [ 67 ] , and the calcium - regulated Actin - bundling protein B ( AbpB ) [ 56 ] . The nuclear rods of Dictyostelium contain the actin variant Filactin ( Fia ) [ 56 ] . Ishikawa - Ankerhold , et al . [ 56 ] described the spatiotemporal sequence of the formation of intranuclear rods and recruitment of its components in DMSO - stressed Dictyostelium . The formation of the rod starts 5 min after stressor application and lasts 30 – 60 min . During the ﬁrst 5 – 10 min , the actin aggregates with the coﬁlin into short spikes in the vicinity of the nuclear envelope . Between 15 and 20 min , the spikes recruit Fia and Aip1 and aggregate into bundles , and between 30 and 60 min , the bundles associate with AbpB and CorA , and aggregate into mature , thick rods . The knockout studies showed that while the Aip1 is necessary , the Fia and CorA are not essential for the formation of the rods . After removal of the stressor , the rods were disassembled within 30 min . The disassembly was delayed in the absence of CorA or Fia , and faster in the absence of Aip1 , which was expected because the Aip1 - deﬁcient cells did not form fully developed rods [ 56 ] . There are indications that the intranuclear rod formation during the stress is induced by the proteolytic fragments of small GTPase RhoA [ 68 ] . RhoA is a major regulator of actin polymerization and , thus , actin - related cell functions [ 69 ] . Under stress conditions , depending on the type of stressor , RhoA can be either activated or downregulated by the proteolytic cleavage by calpain , caspases , and serine proteases . The amino - terminal cleavage fragment ( RhoA - NTF ) or carboxy - terminal fragment ( RhoA - CTF ) , which form after the exposure of ﬁbroblasts to H 2 O 2 , induce the actin stress ﬁbers in the cytoplasm , while RhoA - CTF also induces the cytoplasmic actin rods in the vicinity of the nuclear membrane [ 68 , 70 ] . This suggests that RhoA - CTF may also translocate to the nucleus and promote intranuclear rod formation [ 68 ] . It should be noted that the inability of the cell to disassemble actin rods can be highly toxic and correlates with many human diseases [ 71 , 72 ] . Although it is often unknown if the nuclear / cytoplasmic actin rods are the causative agent or the byproduct of the disease , there are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s , various neurodegenerative diseases , Huntington’s disease and nemaline myopathy [ 62 , 73 – 76 ] . The pathology of Alzheimer’s brains shows extracellular plaques of β - amyloid ( A β ) peptides . The soluble form of A β causes activation of coﬁlin , which promotes the formation of actin rods . Rods accumulate in neurites and cause synaptic dysfunction [ 62 ] . Similarly , in Huntington’s disease , the inability to clear the nuclear rods from the nerve cells may lead to disease development and progression [ 74 , 75 ] . Biology 2021 , 10 , 304 5 of 14 The intranuclear actin rods are also present in many forms of congenital myopathy , which are caused by the mutation in the α skeletal actin ( ACTA1 ) gene . The mutated ACTA1 induces intranuclear actin rods , which are aggregated through the interaction with α actinin . The accumulation of intranuclear rods in the muscle cells causes their dysfunction and muscle weakness [ 77 ] . Because of these ﬁndings , actin rods are a potential novel therapeutic target in many human diseases . 4 . Actin Role in Nuclear Membrane Rupture In the majority of dividing cells , the nuclear envelope breaks before the division , allowing the attachment of the chromosomes to the division spindle [ 78 ] . The nuclear envelope consists of the outer and inner membrane , nuclear pore complexes , and nuclear lamina , which underlines the inner membrane and is composed of a variety of the type V intermediate filament proteins , called nuclear lamins [ 79 ] . In humans , the mutations in nuclear lamins cause many hereditary diseases , including muscular dystrophy , peripheral neuropathy , and progeria [ 80 ] . The first step in the nuclear envelope breakdown ( NEBD ) is the disassembly of the nuclear pore complexes . This is followed by the depolymerization of the nuclear lamina , and , thus , the weakening of the nuclear envelope [ 81 , 82 ] . Common belief has been that the mechanical force needed for the final breakage of the nuclear envelope comes from the microtubules , which after attaching , through the motor protein dynein , to the weakened nuclear envelope , pull and break the membrane [ 83 , 84 ] . Although this is certainly true for small - size somatic cell nuclei , recent studies showed that in the large - size oocyte nuclei , instead of the microtubules , actin is very much involved in the breakage of the nuclear envelope [ 85 ] . Studies on starfish oocytes showed that , before the NEBD , an Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent polymerization of actin leads to the formation of a shell consisting of densely packed branched actin within the nuclear lamina ( Figure 2 ) [ 86 , 87 ] . Subsequently , the actin spikes , protruding from the actin shell , pierce and fragment the nuclear membrane while leaving the nuclear lamina intact ( Figure 2 ) [ 87 , 88 ] . Because the actin shell is also present in the nuclei of oocytes and dividing embryos in other echinoderm species , it seems that the actin - aided rupture of the nuclear envelope is , if not universal , much more common than previously thought [ 85 ] . Figure 2 . Actin’s role in the nuclear envelope breakdown . The nuclear envelope is composed of a double nuclear membrane and an underlying nuclear lamina . Prior to the nuclear envelope breakdown ( NEBD ) , the actin shell polymerizes within the nuclear lamina . This is followed by the formation of the actin spikes , which displace the nuclear pore complexes ( NPCs ) , and penetrate and fragment the nuclear membrane . Biology 2021 , 10 , 304 6 of 14 5 . Actin Role in Chromatin Organization and Remodeling A single human cell contains around 2m of DNA that is packed into a ~ 10 µ m nucleus . To achieve this , the DNA is wounded around histones and compacted into the heterochro - matin [ 89 ] . Because such condensed DNA is unavailable to the transcription factors , it has to undergo remodeling into the more open , transcription factors - accessible euchro - matin [ 90 ] . The nucleus contains chromatin and the interchromatin compartments [ 91 , 92 ] . In the interphase nucleus , the individual chromosomes occupy their designated place—a chromosome territory [ 93 ] . Thus , chromatin is not randomly distributed within the chro - matin compartment but is sub - compartmentalized into deﬁned and functionally different domains , whose chromatin is anchored to the nuclear lamina , nucleoli , or other subnuclear bodies . One of the functions of chromatin / chromosome compartmentalization is the inclu - sion or exclusion of the speciﬁc factors involved in the regulation of gene splicing , silencing , transcription , and replication [ 94 ] . Chromatin compartmentalization is accompanied by the compartmentalization of nuclear actin [ 91 ] . In the interphase nucleus , chromatin displays constant movements and reordering , which allow for repositioning of the loci and the placement of the transcriptionally active genes in a common nuclear space , where they can be co - transcribed [ 93 ] . Time - lapse observations of the ﬂuorescently tagged loci or chromatin territories showed that in mammalian cells , the chromatin is more mobile in the early G1 phase than in the S or G2 phase of the cell cycle . These studies showed that in early G1 the chromatin territories move between 0 . 47 and 4 . 44 µ m , and only 0 . 25 – 2 . 11 µ m in the later stages [ 95 , 96 ] . There are two major mechanisms of chromatin mobility , one is the Brownian’s motions , and another is an active , actin - dependent , and ATP - dependent movement , which allows reordering chromatin compaction to access genetic loci for tran - scription or repair . Actin functions in this process as a subunit of the chromatin - modifying ( remodeling ) complexes ( Figure 3 ) [ 16 , 97 ] . Figure 3 . Actin’s role in chromatin remodeling and transcription . Nuclear G - actin , as a part of a chromatin remodeling complex , participates in remodeling a condensed transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin into the RNA polymerase accessible decondensed euchromatin . Monomeric or oligomeric actin forms a complex with RNAPII promoting the enrichment of RNPII at the promoter and the transcription of mRNA . In contrast , nuclear actin rods , which are formed during the stress , inhibit the actin - dependent activity of RNAPII . Among many actin - containing chromatin remodeling complexes in yeast , inverte - brate , and vertebrate cells , the most studied are BAF , INO80 , NuA4 / TIP60 , SWR1 , and Mi - 2 [ 16 , 98 , 99 ] . BAF , the ATP - dependent Brahma - related gene ( Brg ) / Brahma - associated factor , also called the SWItch / Sucrose Non - Fermentable ( SWI / SNF ) is critical for lineage speciﬁcation in the early mouse embryo and neuronal development in humans [ 98 , 100 ] . Mutations of the BAF subunits are linked to autism , schizophrenia , and many neurodevel - Biology 2021 , 10 , 304 7 of 14 opmental disorders [ 100 ] . INO80 complex contains the Ino80 ATPase that is a member of the SNF2 family of ATPases [ 101 ] . It is possible that in ATP - dependent chromatin remodel - ing complexes such as INO80 , ATP binding to actin results in the conformational change of the whole complex allowing it to remodel . These complexes , using the energy produced by ATP hydrolysis , also participate in the movement of nucleosomes and the chromatin [ 102 ] . These complexes use the ATP - derived energy to displace or exchange , package , and posi - tion the histones / or histone variants within the nucleosomes [ 16 , 103 – 108 ] . On the other hand , the monomeric actin found in the INO80 complex regulates its ability to bind and mobilize nucleosomes and repair DNA damage . It has been suggested that the actin - Arps that modulates INO80 is also present in other remodeling complexes serving as a platform to contact the nucleosomal DNA [ 16 ] . Additionally , the analysis of the crystal structure of the Arp8 module of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae INO80 , showed that during chromatin remodeling , the actin - Arps complex facilitates recognition of the extranucleosomal 40 - bp linker DNA [ 109 , 110 ] . Two different functions of actin in the chromatin remodeling com - plexes have been proposed . Either the complex is attached to the actin ﬁlament and moves along the ﬁlament propelled by the ﬁlament polymerization - depolymerization , or the monomeric actin directly interacts with the chromatin , or other unconventional forms of actin oligomers , performing some ( currently unknown ) functions in the chromatin remodel - ing complexes [ 16 ] . Another chromatin - modifying complex is the histone acetyltransferase complex NuA4 / TIP60 , which is involved in chromatin - binding , histone modiﬁcations , transcription , DNA damage response , control of the cell cycle , nonhomologous end joying , and homologous recombination [ 16 , 111 – 113 ] . Recent studies showed that the SWR1 remod - eling complex deposits Htz1 histone into the chromatin and prevents genome instability , which is often associated with tumorigenesis [ 114 , 115 ] . The incorporation of Htz1 histone into the chromatin may stabilize damaged replication forks ( by preventing fork regression ) , or if the replication fork had collapsed , the Htz , incorporated at the sites of replication dam - age , prevents DNA double - strand breaks [ 115 ] . The Mi - 2 / NuRD ( Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase ) complex has ATP - dependent chromatin remodeling activity and also histone deacetylase activity [ 99 ] . Studies on Drosophila showed that the chromatin containing DNA with the double - strand breaks relocates to the nuclear periphery for repair . The relocation of this damaged DNA occurs through a myosin - dependent sliding on the actin ﬁlaments , which polymerase in response to the DNA damage [ 110 , 116 ] . Recent studies using Xenopus cell - free extracts , human bone osteosarcoma epithelial cells U2OS , and mouse - tail ﬁbroblast cell lines showed that nuclear actin together with Arp2 / 3 and WASP are recruited into the chromatin undergoing the homology - directed repair ( HDR ) [ 117 ] . These studies also showed that actin repositions DNA containing the double - strand brakes ( DSBs ) under - going HDR , into the speciﬁc chromatin repair domains and that the inhibition of actin nucleation decreases HDR efﬁciency [ 117 ] . Another study on Xenopus cell - free extracts and human somatic cells showed that DNA replication ( both initiation and elongation ) depends on nuclear shuttling dynamics of actin and formin [ 22 , 118 ] . Live and supper - resolution imaging studies of human lung ﬁbroblast cell line IMR90 showed that during replication stress ( induced by DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin or the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea ) , the replication foci are translocated along actin ﬁlaments to the nuclear periphery where they undergo repair [ 119 ] . 6 . Actin Role in Transcription Besides being a component of chromatin remodeling complexes , nuclear actin reg - ulates various transcription factors and associates with all RNA polymerases [ 120 , 121 ] , i . e . , RNA polymerase I that transcribes rRNA , RNA polymerase II that transcribes mRNA , miRNA , snRNA , and snoRNA , and RNA polymerase III that transcribes tRNA and 5S rRNA [ 26 , 120 – 122 ] . The interaction of actin with these three RNA polymerases is mediated by the RNA - binding proteins , Rbp6 and Rbp8 [ 121 ] . Both G - actin and actin oligomers are known to associate with RNA polymerases [ 122 , 123 ] . The in vivo and in vitro stud - ies of the Pol I - , Pol II - , and Pol III - dependent transcription [ 121 ] showed that actin is Biology 2021 , 10 , 304 8 of 14 recruited into the gene promoters , where it recruits polymerases , becomes a part of the polymerase preinitiation complexes ( Figure 3 ) , and together with the nuclear myosin - 1 is involved in transcript elongation [ 99 ] . Recent studies using RNA - seq and super - resolution imaging [ 120 ] showed that the serum stimulation and interferon - γ treatment induce the assembly of nuclear actin ﬁlaments , which in turn , enhance the clustering of polymerase II ( Pol II ) and promote transcription of serum - and interferon - γ - inducible genes in the CRISPR - edited osteosarcoma U2OS cell line [ 120 ] . However , it is still unknown how nuclear actin assembles the clusters of Pol II on the speciﬁc genes [ 120 ] . Actin also directly interacts with the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U ( hnRNP U ) , which contains the actin - binding site in its C - terminus and is a component of pre - mRNA particles [ 99 ] . Studies of the conditional knockout of the Hnrnpu gene in the mouse heart showed that the hnRNP U is required for mRNA splicing and heart development [ 124 ] . Studies of the transcription process in the dipteran Chironomus showed that actin binds directly to the hnRNP , HRP65 - 2 that facilitates the recruitment of H3 - speciﬁc acetyltransferase p2D10 [ 99 , 121 , 122 , 125 ] . After transcription , actin , incorporated into the hnRNPs , moves with the newly synthesized transcript to the polyribosomes [ 110 ] . Because the changes in the chromatin and genome architecture are also known at - tributes of the embryonic and post - embryonic cellular differentiation and correlate with many different diseases , one of the fascinating roles of nuclear actin is its involvement in the establishment of cell fate , differentiation programs during neurogenesis , myogenesis , organs’ development , and development of various diseases [ 110 , 124 ] . 7 . Nuclear Actin in Macrophages and Other Immune Cells The multifunctionality of nuclear actin suggests that nuclear actin has to be also important for the differentiation and functions of immune cells . For over a decade , our laboratory has studied the structure and functions of macrophages in the rejection of trans - planted organs . Our studies in rodent transplantation models showed that the integrity of macrophage actin cytoskeleton is indispensable for the macrophage - dependent long - term phase of graft rejection [ 126 – 128 ] . These ﬁndings also prompted our interest in the role of nuclear actin in the macrophages and the immune cells , in general . In the following paragraph , we describe what is currently known about nuclear actin in macrophages and other immune cells . During the activation of the immune response , the monocytes circulating in the blood are recruited by the inflammatory signals to the site of inflammation or infection , where they differentiate into the macrophages . In the in vitro experiments , the blood - derived monocytes or bone marrow - derived cells can be forced to differentiate into macrophages , and / or polarized into different macrophage subtypes by the addition of various cytokines and factors , such as , mentioning a few , interferon - gamma , interleukins , the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) [ 126 – 128 ] . Interestingly , the LPS has been shown to reorganize actin cytoskeleton in many different cell types , including macrophages [ 129 ] . Studies of human blood - derived monocytes and promyelocytic leukemia cells ( HL - 60 ) showed that during the PMA - induced differentiation of these cells into the macrophages , there is a massive influx , dependent on the p38 mitogen - activated kinase , of actin into the cell nucleus . Nuclear actin content increased 12 – 32 - fold during 24 – 72 h of PMA treatment , and the recruited nuclear actin was incorporated into Pol - II complexes [ 130 , 131 ] . The ChiP - on - chip experiments identified the actin - bound promoters of the genes related to the chromatin remodeling , transcription , RNA splicing , apoptosis , and immune response , and the knockout experiments showed that actin binding to the promoters modulated the expression of these genes [ 130 ] . Studies on the migration of keratinocytes showed that nuclear actin regulates transcription of genes related to the focal adhesions and cell migration and that the knockout of the importin 9 , which lowered nuclear actin level , increased keratinocyte migration [ 132 ] . These studies are also relevant to the macrophages and other immune cells , which have to actively migrate to the target tissues and organs . Biology 2021 , 10 , 304 9 of 14 Studies of the nuclear signaling events during CD4 + T cell activation showed that the T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) signaling , which drives T cell differentiation and proliferation , induces the formation of the nuclear actin network . Nuclear actin regulates the expression of IL - 2 , IL - 6 , IL - 9 , IL - 10 , IL - 21 , IFN - γ , and TNF - α , thus , the immune functions of the T cells [ 133 ] . Additionally , the actin - dependent recruitment of RNAPII at promoter sites regulates the transcription of genes involved in T cell differentiation [ 134 ] . All these studies indicate that the drugs modulating the nuclear / cytoplasmic actin dynamics in the immune cells could be potentially used as an anti - inﬂammatory and / or anti - cancer therapies [ 126 , 127 , 135 ] . Taking into consideration the multifaceted role of nuclear actin and a dynamic ex - change between the nuclear and cytoplasmic actin pool , the future challenge will be to further deﬁne the functions of nuclear actin in various cellular processes and different cell types and organisms .
