Methods The study included a total of 632 patients admitted to the vascular surgery department in three periods : March – May 2020 , October – December 2020 , and October – December 2019 as a control period . Results In the pandemic periods the number of admitted patients decreased in relation to the control period . There was a reduction in performed procedures . We observed an increase in the ratio of less invasive procedures . There was a significant decline in hospitalization time in comparison to the control period . Conclusions The reduction of scheduled admissions and procedures affected vascular centers all over the world . Minimally invasive procedures were more willingly performed to shorten the hospitalization time and reduce the patient’s exposure to hospital infection . It allowed us to treat more patients during the second wave . Nevertheless , an increased number of vascular patients should be expected in the future , which will result from the failure to per‑ form elective procedures during the pandemic . Keywords COVID‑19 , Pandemic , Vascular surgery , Public health , Healthcare system , Health , Surgical treatment Background The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) . The first reports of the disease come in Decem - ber 2019 from Wuhan , Hubei Province , China [ 1 ] . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared COVID - 19 as a Public Health Emergency of Interna - tional Concern on January 30 , 2020 [ 2 ] . On March 11 , 2020 , WHO declared COVID - 19 as a pandemic , due to the rapid global spread and severe course of the disease [ 3 ] . Open Access © The Author ( s ) 2024 .

European Journal of Medical Research ( 2024 ) 29 : 127 In Poland , a state of pandemic was declared in March 2020 . Simultaneously the first lockdown was intro - duced . All non - essential businesses and activities were ceased , and home confinement was required for every - one not involved in essential activities [ 4 ] . The COVID - 19 pandemic has prompted a dramatic reorganization of the healthcare system . People’s access to health care has significantly deteriorated . Dozens of public health facilities have been closed to patients not suffering from COVID - 19 . It has postponed or canceled many diagnostic and treatment elective hospitalizations , including planned surgeries in Poland [ 5 ] . Taking into consideration that patients with vascular diseases are especially prone to the development of complicated diseases if infected with SARS - CoV - 2 , it is particularly interesting to evaluate how the approach to that group of patients has changed during the COVID - 19 pan - demic [ 6 ] . Antoni Jurasz University Hospital number 1 in Bydgo - szcz , Poland is the biggest hospital in the Kuyavian - Pomeranian Voivodeship inhabited by over 2 . 02 million people [ 7 ] . It is also a didactic center of the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun , Poland educating medi - cal students , doctors , specialists , and employees of other medical professions . The Department of Vascular Sur - gery and Angiology is one of Poland’s largest vascular surgery centers . It performs a full range of arterial and venous system procedures , including the most advanced and complicated surgeries . More than 1000 procedures are performed annually . During the pandemic , our department was closed many times due to the COVID - 19 infection among patients and personnel . Moreover , for several weeks it remained closed because rooms and beds were dedicated exclu - sively to patients with COVID - 19 a " COVID - 19 ward " . This led to the cancellation of all vascular patients’ hos - pitalizations . Emergency cases were referred to lower - reference centers . In our opinion , the impacts of COVID - 19 on vascular surgery medicine , especially in Poland , have not been fully assessed yet . Although several publications have appeared on the impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic on vascular surgery practice , they are from Western Europe or the United States . Results from neither Central Europe nor Poland were not published so far . In this context , we analyzed our department reorganization in response to the first and second waves of the COVID - 19 pandemic . The analysis aimed to describe evolving strategies during the second wave of the pandemic , taking a lesson from the first wave . Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death [ 8 ] . It is necessary to assess the impact of the pan - demic , lockdowns , and healthcare reorganization on the performance of vascular service provision and the changes needed to prepare for the post - pandemic time . Materials and methods A retrospective registry of patients admitted to the Department of Vascular Surgery and Angiology Antoni Jurasz University Hospital number 1 in Bydgoszcz , Poland . Data were collected from 3 time periods : the period of the first wave of the pandemic ( FWP ) from March 1 to May 31 , 2020 , the period of the second wave of the pandemic ( SWP ) from October 1 to December 31 , 2020 , and the period before the pandemic ( PBP ) from October 1 to December 31 , 2019 as a control period . A total of 632 patients were included in the study ( FWP : n = 188 , SWP : n = 200 , PBP : n = 244 ) . We com - pared clinical and surgical data that were prospectively collected into a database , including pre - , intra - , and perioperative variables . The following were analyzed : length of hospitalization stay , the general condition of the patient on admission , the mode of admission ( planned , urgent , acute ) , final diagnosis , and performed diagnostic and treatment procedures . The general medical condition of patients on admis - sion to the Department was determined by the American Hospital Association Guidelines for Releasing Informa - tion on the Condition of Patients . Patients were qualified as in good ( vital signs stable and within normal limits , patient conscious ) , fair ( vital signs stable and within nor - mal limits , the patient is conscious , but may be uncom - fortable ) , serious ( vital signs un - stable and not within normal limits ) and critical ( vital signs unstable and not within normal limits , the patient may be unconscious ) state [ 9 ] . Due to the small size of groups , serious and crit - ical state patients were counted together . Admissions were divided into planned ( PA , scheduled admission ) , acute ( AA , un - planned admission , surgery performed after detailed diagnostics and patient prepa - ration , most often within a few days of admission ) , and urgent ( UA , unplanned admission , emergency surgery , most often within 6 h of admission ) . A small group of patients was classified as " other admissions " ( OA ) . They were mainly patients transferred from other wards after previously performed surgeries . Planned admissions concerned cases of aortic aneu - rysms with a diameter over 55 mm in males and over 50 mm in females , high - grade carotid artery stenoses in asymptomatic patients , lower limb ischemia eligible for surgery except for critical ischemia , venous insuf - ficiency and other arteries aneurysms or stenoses in asymptomatic patients . Acute admissions included large aortic aneurysms or aneurysms with a high risk of rupture , symptomatic carotid artery stenoses , and chronic limb - threatening ischemia ( CLTI ) . Medical Page 3 of 11 Stadnik‑Zawalska et al . European Journal of Medical Research ( 2024 ) 29 : 127 conditions that were treated with urgency included symptomatic and ruptured aneurysms , acute aortic syndromes , acute limb ischemia ( ALI ) , and vascular traumatic injuries . Final diagnoses ICD - 10 codes were grouped into the following categories : ALI , carotid artery stenoses , aortic aneurysms ( including abdominal , thoracic , and abdominothoracic ) , vascular graft infection , lower extremities artery disease ( including CLTI ) , post - trau - matic conditions , Leriche syndrome , venous insuf - ficiency and thrombosis , other artery aneurysm and stenoses ( i . e . renal , visceral , subclavian ) and others— not classified elsewhere . Performed procedures and operations were classi - fied as follows : major and minor amputation , revascu - larization for lower extremity arterial disease ( LEAD ) , carotid artery revascularization , endovascular aneu - rysm repair , open aorta repair , acute limb ischemia revascularization , angiography , venous revasculariza - tion , aorta revascularization , other aneurysms pro - cedures , other artery revascularization ( i . e . visceral , subclavian , renal ) and others—not classified elsewhere . The analysis of quantitative variables ( i . e . , expressed in numbers ) was performed by calculating the mean , standard deviation , and median . The analysis of qualita - tive variables ( i . e . , not expressed in numbers ) was per - formed by calculating the number and percentage of occurrences of each value . The comparison of qualita - tive variables in groups was performed using the chi - square test ( with Yates’ correction for 2 × 2 tables ) . The comparison of quantitative variables in the two groups was performed using the Mann – Whitney test . The analysis adopted a significant level of 0 . 05 . The registry data were collected using MS Office Excel ® and TIBCO Statistica 13 . 3 . 0 ( Copyright © 2021 TIBCO Software Inc . ) and analyzed using descriptive statistics . The study design and methodology were developed based on similar , previously published studies describing the impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic on various fields of medicine [ 10 – 13 ] . Results In the three analyzed periods , 632 patients were hospi - talized . During the first wave of the pandemic ( FWP ) , 188 patients were treated , which constituted 29 . 7 % of all patients included in the study . During the second wave of the pandemic ( SWP ) , the number of hospitalized patients increased slightly ( n = 200 , 31 . 6 % of all patients included ) . In both analyzed periods , a decrease in the number of hospitalized patients was observed ( FWP by 23 % , SWP by 18 % ) ( Table 1 ) . The ratio of hospitalized women and men in all sub - groups was similar . Women accounted for about one - third of those treated . The mean age of the patients in each group was similar and the median was identical in all subgroups ( 69 years ) . In the control period ( PBP ) , almost half of the hospi - talizations were scheduled admissions ( PA ) . During the pandemic , the number of PA decreased significantly ( fourfold reduction during FWP and twofold reduction during SWP ) and acute admissions started to prevail . The number of urgent ( UA ) and other admissions ( OA ) in the analyzed periods were similar ( Fig . 1 ) . The mean length of hospitalization in the three ana - lyzed periods was 9 . 1 days . During the first wave of the pandemic hospitalizations were noticeably longer than during the second wave ( mean in FWP = 11 . 15 [ days ] Table 1 Summarized description of patients included into the study FWP , first pandemic wave ; SWP , second pandemic wave ; PBP , period before pandemic ; ns , non significance FWP p ( vs .

During the second wave the trend was reversed , and hospitalization time was much shorter than in the control period ( mean in SWP = 6 . 90 [ days ] vs . mean in PBP = 9 . 10 [ days ] , p = 0 . 011087 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . In the three analyzed periods , 597 vascular procedures were performed . During FWP 199 procedures were per - formed in 156 patients . During SWP the number and mean of interventions performed per patient decreased . In both pandemic periods , a decrease in the number of procedures was observed compared to the control period ( FWP by 11 % , SWP by 22 % ) ( Table 2 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . In the pandemic periods , an increase in the ratio of endovascular and hybrid procedures ( FWP 57 . 7 % , SWP 62 . 6 % vs . PBP 45 . 6 % ) was detected . During the FWP , a significant decrease was found in the number of carotid artery revascularization ( 10 in FWP vs . 37 in PBP , a decrease of 72 . 97 % , p = 0 . 000319 ) , but an increase in the number of endovascular aneurysm repairs ( EVAR ) sur - geries ( 38 in FWP vs . 23 in PBP , an increase of 39 . 47 % , p = 0 . 01465 ) ( Table 3 ) . The medical state of patients on admission to the department was similar in both pandemic periods and during the control time . Most of the patients admitted to the department on a planned or acute mode were in a good or fair state . In serious and critical condition were mainly patients suffering from ruptured aneurysm and after trauma admitted in urgent mode ( Table 4 ) . The cross - section of final diagnoses did not change throughout the pandemic waves ( Table 5 ) . During the FWP , we observed a significant decrease in patients with carotid artery stenoses ( 72 . 22 % ) , and an increase in acute limb ischemia ( ALI ) 42 . 86 % ) and aortic aneu - rysm disease ( 25 % ) . The decreased number of patients diagnosed with carotid artery stenoses concerned asymptomatic patients . The number of symptomatic ones was 6 , 8 , and 6 during FWP , SWP , and PBP , respectively . The symptomatic to asymptomatic ratio was , respectively , 1 . 50 ( FWP ) , 0 . 62 ( SWP ) , and 0 . 20 ( PBP ) . During the pandemic , the absolute number of patients admitted because of LEAD decreased regard - ing to the control period ( 65 . 5 % during FWP and 26 . 4 % during SWP ) but without statistical significance . Patients with LEAD constituted 29 . 3 % in FWP , 36 . 0 % in SWP , and 37 . 3 % in PBP of all admitted patients , respectively . The majority of patients treated during the Fig . 1 Types of admission to hospital , taking into account urgency ( FWP , first wave of the pandemic ; SWP , second wave of the pandemic ; PBP , period before pandemic ) Page 5 of 11 Stadnik‑Zawalska et al . European Journal of Medical Research ( 2024 ) 29 : 127 pandemic suffered from limb ischemia in the III and IV stage of the Fontaine Classification [ 14 ] . During FWP , the number of amputations was higher ( total amputations : 20 in FWP vs . 16 in PBP and major amputations 17 in FWP vs . 11 in PBP ) but without statis - tical significance . The number of patients diagnosed with acute limb ischemia ( ALI ) was 30 , 28 , and 21 during FWP , SWP , and PBP , respectively . The amputation - to - revascu - larization ratio due to ALI treatment was 4 : 21 , 4 : 18 , and 0 : 19 during FWP , SWP , and PBP , respectively . The other patients with ALI ( 4 in FWP and 3 in SWP ) were treated conservatively or disqualified from treatment due to their severe general condition . Among patients with ALI in SWP four were diagnosed with COVID - 19 , one was convalescent , and one patient’s test result was inconclu - sive . In a group of patients with confirmed COVID - 19 , a higher rate of revascularization failure and the necessity for amputation were observed . Patients admitted during FWP were not tested for COVID - 19 or they presented negative results . Discussion The COVID - 19 pandemic has affected our vascular sur - gery and angiology department in multiple ways . The pandemic had an impact on the number of hospitaliza - tions and resulted in a decrease in scheduled admissions .

European Journal of Medical Research ( 2024 ) 29 : 127 This was in line with the global trend not only in vascular but in other branches of surgery as well [ 13 , 15 ] . During SWP , the decrease in scheduled admissions was lower than during FWP ( 48 . 76 % vs . 75 . 21 % ) . This may be due to the staff becoming acquainted with the procedures applicable during the pandemic . In the United States , during the early pandemic ( April 2020 ) 98 % of vascu - lar surgery practices limited elective admissions , while during the late pandemic ( August 2020 ) only 19 % [ 16 ] . Researchers from Northern Italy noticed an 18 % increase in the number of procedures performed during phase 2 of the pandemic ( May – June 2020 ) compared with phase 1 ( March – April 2020 ) [ 12 ] . General surgeons from this country found a 25 % decrease in the number of surgeries during the pandemic compared to the previous period . Similarly to our observation , patients operated for emer - gency reasons was significantly older than in the period before the pandemic [ 13 ] . The reduction of scheduled admissions led to a decreased number of performed procedures and surgeries . In 2020 Ng et al . conducted a survey among vascular surgeons from all over the world about the procedures performed during the pandemic . Results showed that 90 . 9 % of the units had postponed scheduled admissions . The majority of cases canceled were varicose vein surgery , revascularization for claudi - cation , “small” or asymptomatic aortic aneurysms , dialy - sis access , and asymptomatic carotid stenoses procedures [ 17 ] . In our department , we also observed a statistically sig - nificant decrease in the number of patients admitted with asymptomatic carotid artery stenoses . Carotid stenoses are considered to be responsible for 10 – 15 % of ischemic strokes [ 18 ] . Current guidelines recommend performing carotid revascularization within 14 days after symptoms onset to decrease the risk of recurrent cerebrovascular accidents [ 19 ] . Postponing procedures in these patients would not be reasonable . Hospitalizations of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenoses were also postponed in other countries . In France during the first lockdown of the COVID - 19 pandemic , a 58 % decrease in carotid revascularization procedures was observed , mostly concerned asymptomatic patients [ 20 ] . Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is a risk factor for stroke , myocardial infarction , and mortality . The latest cohort studies com - paring carotid revascularization versus medical therapy in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis showed Fig . 3 Performed procedures ( PBP , period before pandemic ; FWP , first wave of the pandemic ; SWP , second wave of the pandemic ) Page 7 of 11 Stadnik‑Zawalska et al . European Journal of Medical Research ( 2024 ) 29 : 127 that 30 - day stroke risk reaches 0 . 6 % without surgical intervention . Long - term risk of ipsilateral stroke totals from 1 . 98 to 5 . 5 % on pharmacological therapy and decreases to 0 . 65 % after carotid endarterectomy [ 21 ] . The consequences of postponing lower limb revascu - larization procedures are difficult to determine . There is no evidence for the effectiveness of non - revascular - ization methods in the treatment of CLTI . Progress - ing walking impairment in earlier stages can be treated with verapamil , statins , antiplatelet agents , prostanoids , and non - pharmacologically by exercise therapy [ 22 ] . The Claudication : Exercise Versus Endoluminal Revasculari - zation ( CLEVER ) study demonstrates that for patients with claudication , supervised exercise therapy provides a superior improvement in treadmill walking performance compared to both primary stenting and optimal medi - cal care ( home walking and cilostazol ) over 6 months . This benefit was associated with an improvement in self - reported walking distance , an increase in HDL fraction of cholesterol , and a decrease in fibrinogen [ 23 ] . Other vascular surgery units , likewise our department , had reported admitting for surgery fewer patients with LEAD but with a more severe clinical presentation during the pandemic . It resulted in palliative care and primary Table 3 Diagnostic and treatment procedures FWP , first pandemic wave ; SWP , second pandemic wave ; PBP , period before pandemic ; LEAD , lower extremity arterial disease ; EVAR , endovascular aneurysm repair ; OAR , open aortic aneurysm repair ; ALI , acute limb ischemia ; ns , non significance Procedure FWP p ( vs .

European Journal of Medical Research ( 2024 ) 29 : 127 amputations in some cases [ 24 ] . This is confirmed by the latest data from Brazil , where a significant increase in lower limb amputations has been recorded during the pandemic [ 25 ] . Direct research on LEAD progres - sion is essential , both in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients whose procedures were canceled or postponed due to the COVID - 19 pandemic . Unexpectedly , in our results , the number of patients with aortic aneurysm procedures was significantly higher during FWP . The number of open aorta repair ( OAR ) procedures was similar to other periods , but the number of endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) pro - cedures increased considerably . EVAR reduces the aver - age hospital stay by 296 . 75 h compared to OAR [ 26 ] . The increased number of minimally invasive aneurysm opera - tions resulted from a desire for faster discharge . Other data were obtained from centers in other countries . Ger - man surgeons observed a significant ( − 25 . 5 % ) decrease in the number of patients with abdominal aortic aneu - rysms during the first wave of the pandemic . Similarly to our center , the number of cases treated endovascularly increased during the all waves of pandemic . Interestingly , a significant increase ( 22 . 2 % ) in the number of ruptured aneurysms has been observed during the pandemic [ 27 ] . The pandemic has shifted the treatment profile towards less invasive procedures . During the control phase “open procedures” accounted for 54 % of all procedures . In both the first and the second wave of the pandemic endovas - cular and hybrid procedures were performed more often than open procedures . The importance of endovascu - lar methods in vascular surgery has increased in recent years . In Guez et al . research endovascular treatment of peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) in the years 2011 – 2016 increased by 25 % [ 28 ] . In our department , the year - to - year increase in endovascular treatment was 13 . 7 % ( PBP 42 . 0 % vs . SWP 55 . 7 % ) . The percentage rise resulted from a trend of change towards endovascular therapy , how - ever , the pandemic period significantly accelerated this process . Referring to the meta - analysis by Ting et al . comparing outcomes of open surgery and endovascu - lar methods of PAD treatment , the latter presents more advantages . In comparison to open surgery , endovascu - lar treatment is characterized by less complication , lower mortality rate , lower amputation risk , and shorter hospi - tal stay [ 29 ] . The role of endovascular therapy in the pan - demic period is even more important . A shorter hospital stay reduces the risk of nosocomial infection for both the patient and the medical staff , in case of operating COVID - 19 - positive patients . In addition , the ability to perform procedures under local anesthesia decreases the chance of postoperative complications , thereby increas - ing ICU resources such as bed availability [ 30 , 31 ] . The pandemic period contributed to accelerating progress in the use of minimally invasive procedures . During the acute phase of the COVID - 19 pandemic in Italy , endo - vascular procedures were chosen with increased fre - quency . Among the advantages of these methods , the vascular surgery unit included the ability to perform surgery under local anesthesia [ 32 ] . The pandemic has forced surgeons to change algorithms and adapt treat - ment to current resources . According to the COVER study , 60 . 4 % of units selected endovascular methods as the first choice of limb ischemia treatment during the pandemic [ 33 ] . Examples from other centers prove the shift towards the endovascular approach and its use in circumstances where it was previously not the first - line treatment . The constant development of technology allows open surgery to be replaced by less invasive pro - cedures . Robot - assisted procedures are also starting to appear in vascular surgery . These techniques have found applicability in the treatment of PAD , fenestrated endo - vascular aortic repair , carotid artery stenting , and trans - femoral renal and mesenteric intervention . They are not yet common due to technical difficulties [ 34 ] . However , the ability to replace some medical staff members with technology may also be advantageous during a critical period such as a pandemic . During the first phase of the pandemic , there was a significant increase in diagnosed acute limb ischemia ( ALI ) . The association between ALI and SARS - CoV - 2 is well documented and caused by a hypercoagulable con - dition and hyperimmune systemic response provoked by pneumonia [ 35 ] . The COVID - 19 disease is also known as a risk factor for arterial and venous thrombosis [ 36 ] . As reported , SARS - CoV - 2 infection leads to increased values of D - dimers , fibrinogen , and von Willebrand fac - tor ( vWF ) . A short prothrombin time ( PT ) and activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) is only observed in some patients . In severe cases , a condition resembling disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) develops [ 37 , 38 ] . As described in Wool and Miller’s article , in 5 . 0 – 41 . 7 % of patients , thrombocytopenia is found . The authors observed elevated immature platelet fraction ( IPF ) in COVID - 19 cases , and also in patients without thrombocytopenia . This may explain the mechanism of hypercoagulability due to the higher activity of imma - ture platelets and their easier aggregation [ 37 ] . Research by Cohen et al . confirmed that IPF is positively corre - lated with the severity of the disease and may be used as its indicator [ 39 ] . Pneumonia caused by COVID - 19 is associated with vascular endothelium damage and its dysfunction . Apoptosis of infected endothelial cells triggers pro - coagulant processes [ 38 ] . The unbalanced immune response in severe patients may lead to the overactivation of neutrophils . This process triggers pro - thrombotic pathways . As suspected , the cytokine storm , Page 9 of 11 Stadnik‑Zawalska et al . European Journal of Medical Research ( 2024 ) 29 : 127 uncontrolled complement activity , and NETosis ( pro - gram for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps ) may be responsible for blood clotting . This mechanism is also known as immune thrombosis [ 40 ] . Ali and Spin - ler’s article lists deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism as the most common vascular coagulopathies associated with COVID - 19 [ 40 ] . Thrombotic events such as ALI , ischemic stroke , and myocardial infarction are observed as well [ 40 – 42 ] . A reduction in the length of hospitalization during the SWP compared to the PBP is noticeable . The reason for the shorter hospital stay was an attempt to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission of COVID - 19 . The [ 42 ] , research shows that hospital - onset COVID - 19 infections ( HOCIs ) reach about 12 – 15 % of all COVID - 19 cases in healthcare institutions . At the culmination of the pan - demic , the risk rises to 16 . 2 % [ 42 ] . The noticeable exten - sion of hospitalization time during FWP is probably because mostly acute and urgent mode patients were admitted , in a worse general condition , and required longer convalescence after the procedure . A similar observation was made in Italy , where the length of hospi - tal stay increased from 3 . 3 ± 2 . 7 days in pre - pandemic to 5 . 3 ± 3 . 9 in the pandemic era ( p = 0 . 004 ) [ 43 ] . The pandemic allowed us to gain knowledge on how to act in a crisis . After analyzing the data from the first wave , we concluded the patient’s eligibility for sur - gery . Similar changes were also forced by the pandemic in other areas of surgery [ 13 ] . Endovascular surgeries were performed more frequently . As a result , in subse - quent phases of the pandemic , hospitalization time was reduced and the risk of nosocomial SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion decreased . Also , we were able to perform more short - time admissions , thereby the waiting time for treat - ment was reduced . The procedures deferred earlier due to the first wave were performed as well . This improve - ment was limited by the short period between the waves and by a concentration of human and financial resources on dealing with the current pandemic threat . Also , such a rapid development of the pandemic in Poland was unex - pected . From March 1 to May 31 , 2020 , there were 23 , 571 new cases and 1061 deaths . The second wave was more widespread , as 1 , 206 , 507 new cases and 26 , 128 deaths were noted from October 1 to December 31 , 2020 [ 44 ] . Conclusions The descriptive nature of the study was aimed to empha - size the experience of a single vascular surgery center in response to the COVID - 19 pandemic . The pandemic had a significant impact on healthcare systems and daily sur - gical practice worldwide . Its consequences are still being experienced to this day . Vascular surgery and angiology units were affected in multiple ways . The described department’s situation is not unique , as multiple vascular surgery units around the world experienced the same changes . There was an overall reduction in vascular activity including inpa - tient procedures and elective admissions . Despite the limitations , we managed to learn a valu - able lesson from the first wave of the pandemic , and we did better in the next waves . Nevertheless , an increased number of vascular patients should be expected in the future , which will result from the failure to perform the necessary elective procedures during the pandemic as well as from the studied effect of the coronavirus infec - tion on thromboembolic complications . Lockdowns and limited access to healthcare caused by the pandemic have generated a " health debt " . Its repercussions may be felt even years after the pandemic ends . More research is indispensable to evaluate the impact on patients with vascular diseases . It is required to develop procedures and workflows to confine the long - term effects of the COVID - 19 pandemic on these patients’ state of health .
