Introduction Directed cell movement is a fundamental process in many physiological contexts . During embryogenesis , it allows cells to move to the appropriate location . In adults , it is responsible for neutrophil - and macrophage - mediated chemotaxis and phagocytosis , as well as lymphocyte - mediated immune functions . The migration of ﬁbroblasts and vascular endothelial cells is required for wound healing . Moreover , the migration of cells contributes to the underlying processes of life - threatening diseases , such as tumor invasion and metastasis . Cell migration is a ﬁnely choreographed event consisting of several distinct steps . The cell initiates a protrusion at the front , which subsequently attaches to the substratum . This is followed by contraction of the cell body and tail detachment , resulting in movement in the direction of the protrusion . The cycle then repeats this process . The initial event in this cycle is a sensing of haptotactic and / or chemotactic signals by cell - surface receptors . These signals are communicated to the interior of the cell , where they activate a complex signaling pathway . The ﬁnal outcome of this is polymerization of new actin at the leading edge , which generates protrusive force . Hence , the directionality of cell migration can be determined by these signals through their ability to set the location of the initial protrusion . Extension of protrusions in response to migratory stimuli is coupled to actin polymerization . Actin ﬁlaments have barbed and pointed ends , the barbed end being the end at which actin monomers are incorporated with higher affinity during polymerization . For an actin monomer to incorporate at a barbed end , it has to be free , i . e . uncapped . For actin polymerization to occur adjacent to the plasma membrane there should , therefore , be an increase in the number of free barbed ends . Three different mechanisms to generate free barbed ends at the membrane exist : ( 1 ) uncapping of pre - existing barbed ends capped by capping protein or gelsolin - related proteins ( Hartwig et al . , 1995 ) ; ( 2 ) severing of ﬁlamentous ( F ) - actin by the actin - binding protein coﬁlin / ADF ( Chan et al . , 2000 ) ; and ( 3 ) de novo nucleation of ﬁlaments involving the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Pollard et al . , 2000 ) or formins ( reviewed by Evangelista et al . , 2003 ; Pruyne et al . , 2002 ) . Furthermore , the availability of local free monomeric G - actin might be an important factor regulating membrane protrusions . Coﬁlin / ADF , along with thymosin β - 4 and proﬁlin , may have an important role to play in modulating G - actin levels . Coﬁlin / ADF ( hereafter called coﬁlin ) has emerged as one of the protein families playing an essential role in actin dynamics at the plasma membrane during cell protrusion ( Bamburg , 1999 ; Condeelis , 2001 ; Ono , 2003 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Coﬁlin is a small ( 19 kDa ) ubiquitous protein that binds to both G - and F - actin ; it has a higher affinity for ADP - bound subunits and enhances the rate of monomer dissociation from the pointed end of actin ﬁlaments ( Bamburg , 1999 ; Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Maciver et al . , 1998 ) . In addition , coﬁlin can also sever actin ﬁlaments and thus directly generate free actin barbed ends ( Chan et al . , 2000 ; Du and Frieden , 1998 ; Ichetovkin et al . , 2000 ; Maciver et al . , 1991 ) . Both the depolymerization and severing activities of coﬁlin are presumably due to its ability to bind cooperatively to F - actin and cause a twist in the actin ﬁlament , which promotes the destabilization of actin - actin interactions and thus fragmentation of the ﬁlament ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . Although the activation of coﬁlin is required for cell motility ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Condeelis , 2001 ) , it was not clear until recently how the relative contributions of coﬁlin - mediated barbed - end formation and subsequent polymerization ( Condeelis , 2001 ) , and coﬁlin - mediated actin depolymerization ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) are balanced during protrusion and cell motility . The relative contributions of these opposing functions of coﬁlin in vivo have been difficult to establish given comparisons of different cell types , in which the consequences of coﬁlin 19 Coﬁlin has emerged as a key regulator of actin dynamics at the leading edge of motile cells . Through its actin - severing activity , it creates new actin barbed ends for polymerization and also depolymerizes old actin ﬁlaments . Its function is tightly regulated in the cell . Spatially , its activity is restricted by other actin - binding proteins , such as tropomyosin , which compete for accessibility of actin ﬁlament populations in different regions of the cell . At the molecular level , it is regulated by phosphorylation , pH and phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate binding downstream of signaling cascades . In addition , it also appears to be regulated by interactions with 14 - 3 - 3 ζ and cyclase - associated protein . In vivo , coﬁlin acts synergistically with the Arp2 / 3 complex to amplify local actin polymerization responses upon cell stimulation , which gives it a central role in setting the direction of motility in crawling cells .

For example , Cramer has argued that , in migrating chick ﬁbroblasts , coﬁlin - mediated depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments provides the actin monomers necessary for ongoing ﬁlament assembly ( Cramer , 1999 ) ; by contrast , in neurons , the severing of actin ﬁlaments by coﬁlin to generate free barbed ends for actin polymerization is essential for growth cone motility ( Endo et al . , 2003 ) . Here , we discuss recent ﬁndings that help to resolve how the polymerization and depolymerization activities of coﬁlin are balanced and have provided new insights into the function of coﬁlin in deﬁning the direction of cell motility . Synergy between Arp2 / 3 and coﬁlin One of the major modulators of actin polymerization in cell protrusions is the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Condeelis et al . , 2001 ; Higgs and Pollard , 2001 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Welch and Mullins , 2002 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex consists of seven polypeptides and is found at actin ﬁlament Y - branches in the submembrane dendritic array ( Bailly et al . , 1999 ; Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . Owing to its in vitro ability to generate new ﬁlament branches in a pre - existing actin ﬁlament network ( Amann and Pollard , 2001 ; Blanchoin et al . , 2000 ; Ichetovkin et al . , 2002 ; Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Pantaloni et al . , 2000 ) , it is believed to be a major contributor to barbed - end generation and cellular protrusion . Several studies have shown that the Arp2 / 3 complex and coﬁlin are present together in dendritic arrays of actin ﬁlaments at the leading edge of motile cells ( Bailly et al . , 1999 ; Chan et al . , 2000 ; Schafer et al . , 1998 ; Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . More recently , analysis of growth - factor - stimulated live cells has shown that coﬁlin is recruited to the leading edge at a slightly faster rate than the Arp2 / 3 complex ( DesMarais et al . , 2004 ) . Both the Arp2 / 3 complex and coﬁlin contribute to barbed - end generation at the leading edge , since function - blocking antibodies directed against either protein signiﬁcantly decrease barbed - end generation and cell protrusion ( Bailly et al . , 2001 ; Chan et al . , 2000 ) . Using a light microscopy assay in vitro that allows direct visualization of actin ﬁlaments , Ichetovkin et al . found that coﬁlin’s severing activity and Arp2 / 3 complex’s nucleation activity alone each cause a moderate increase in actin polymerization ( Ichetovkin et al . , 2002 ) . However , together , they cause signiﬁcantly more actin polymerization than the sum of their individual contributions ( Ichetovkin et al . , 2002 ) . Experiments in live cells using function - blocking antibodies against either coﬁlin or the Arp2 / 3 complex mirror these ﬁndings . The experiments show that , when the contribution of either coﬁlin or the Arp2 / 3 complex is measured in the absence of the other , each alone contributes many fewer barbed ends than the number generated in control cells ( DesMarais et al . , 2004 ) . This suggests synergy between the two pathways . The primary ﬁnding of both studies is that the severing activity of coﬁlin can amplify the nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Ampliﬁcation occurs because coﬁlin creates free barbed ends that nucleate the growth of new actin ﬁlaments , which are preferred sites for the binding of the Arp2 / 3 complex , compared with older , ADP - containing ﬁlaments . The availability of new actin ﬁlaments increases the nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex and biases its branching activity towards the barbed end of the mother ﬁlament . A similar argument has been made for the interaction between the Arp2 / 3 complex and gelsolin in platelets and ﬁbroblasts , in which free actin ﬁlament barbed ends resulting from gelsolin severing are proposed to be necessary for the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Falet et al . , 2002 ) . The original steady - state protrusion model ( Fig . 1 ) , which has been proposed to explain in vitro biochemical data ( Pollard et al . , 2000 ) , does not take the synergistic interaction between coﬁlin and the Arp2 / 3 complex into account . In this model , coﬁlin is proposed to function exclusively as an actin - recycling factor , depolymerizing ﬁlaments to yield G - actin . Depolymerization is required to sustain steady - state actin polymerization at the leading edge ( Fig . 1A ) ; it is tightly coupled to polymerization and is absolutely required for extension of the dendritic network . In this model , coﬁlin is proposed only to depolymerize F - actin , whereas the Arp2 / 3 complex near the cell membrane is responsible for dendritic nucleation . The model can explain the continuous uninterrupted movement of keratocytes and intracellular pathogens in cells , when G - actin levels limit polymerization . Consistent with the steady - state protrusion model is the observed depolymerization activity of coﬁlin in vitro and its localization to lamellipodia in keratocytes ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ; Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . By contrast , the stimulated protrusion model ( Fig . 1 ) considers the synergistic interaction between coﬁlin and the Arp2 / 3 complex . In addition , the ampliﬁcation of Arp2 / 3 - mediated dendritic nucleation by coﬁlin has several implications for models of coﬁlin function in vivo that are covered by this model . In many crawling cells , including ﬁbroblasts and chemotactic carcinoma cells , movement is not continuous and is usually stimulated by some outside signal in the presence of an abundance of G - actin ( > 70 µ M ) ( Edmonds et al . , 1996 ) . In crawling cells that exhibit a ‘stop and start’ mode of motion , actin depolymerization is not required for motility for many minutes after movement starts ( Cramer , 1999 ) . In such cells , coﬁlin is proposed to initiate the assembly of actin ﬁlaments and determine the timing and location of dendritic nucleation and its resulting protrusion . Results showing that coﬁlin is localized with barbed ends at the leading edge and not at the base of lamellipodia in stimulated carcinoma cells ( Chan et al . , 2000 ) , and that coﬁlin is sufficient to generate barbed ends , actin polymerization and protrusion ( Ghosh et al . , 2004 ) , support a direct role for coﬁlin severing in initiating and deﬁning the direction of stimulated cell motility . The two models are not mutually exclusive . A signal such as a chemoattractant could activate the stimulated protrusion mechanism , whereas sustained protrusive activity could involve the steady - state protrusion mechanism . The transition from a stimulated to a sustained protrusion mechanism could occur within the same cell if cell movement continues uninterrupted until G - actin concentrations become limiting to further polymerization , at which time depolymerization should be obligatorily coupled to further polymerization . The important difference between these two models is that , in the stimulated protrusion model , coﬁlin determines the sites of dendritic nucleation and , therefore , cell protrusion . A photoactivatable analog of coﬁlin has been used to test the hypothesis that coﬁlin initiates actin polymerization and Journal of Cell Science 118 ( 1 ) J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 21 Coﬁlin regulates actin dynamics determines sites of cell protrusion and directionality . Uncaging coﬁlin in vivo demonstrates that it generates free barbed ends , polymerizes actin , induces protrusion , and sets the direction of cell migration ( Ghosh et al . , 2004 ) . Indeed , these studies indicate that coﬁlin serves as a dynamic component of the steering wheel of the cell . Recent analysis of the distribution of coﬁlin and phospho - coﬁlin in migrating ﬁbroblasts supports a role for active coﬁlin at the leading edge and in establishing cell polarity ( Dawe et al . , 2003 ) . Regulation of coﬁlin activity It is now apparent that coﬁlin can initiate protrusion and determine cell direction , and it is therefore important to understand how coﬁlin activity is regulated in cells with high spatial and temporal precision . Coﬁlin function appears to be tightly regulated in cells by : phosphorylation ; protein - protein interactions involving tropomyosin , 14 - 3 - 3 ζ and AIP1 ; and inositol phospholipids . In addition , the activity of coﬁlin is stimulated by an increase in pH ( Bernstein et al . , 2000 ; Hawkins et al . , 1993 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1985 ) . Coﬁlin phosphorylation The severing and depolymerization activity of coﬁlin can be inhibited by phosphorylation on Ser3 , which abolishes its actin - binding activity ( Agnew et al . , 1995 ; Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) . Four different kinases that appear to be downstream of the Rho - family GTPases phosphorylate coﬁlin : LIMK1 , LIMK2 , TESK1 and TESK2 ( Arber et al . , 1998 ; Dan et al . , 2001 ; Rosok et al . , 1999 ; Toshima et al . , 2001 ; Yang et al . , 1998 ) . Phosphatases including type 1 , type 2A ( Ambach et al . , 2000 ) , type 2B ( Meberg et al . , 1998 ) , type 2C ( Zhan et al . , 2003 ) and a novel coﬁlin phosphatase , slingshot ( Niwa et al . , 2002 ) , have been implicated in reactivation of coﬁlin by dephosphorylation in a variety of cell types .

The steady - state and stimulated protrusion models . ( A ) In the steady - state model [ based on Pollard et al . ( Pollard et al . , 2000 ) ] , coﬁlin functions only as a G - actin - recycling factor , depolymerizing ﬁlaments to G - actin at the base of the lamellipodium to sustain steady - state actin polymerization at the leading edge when G - actin is limiting ( e . g . in continuously moving cells such as keratocytes ) . Dendritic nucleation at the leading edge occurs from the Arp2 / 3 complex at the interface with the cell membrane . ( B ) The stimulated protrusion model applies to situations when motility is not continuous and G - actin is not limiting . In this case , initiation of movement involves the localized activation of coﬁlin at the leading edge . Severing of actin ﬁlaments in the quiescent cortical cytoskeleton by coﬁlin creates free barbed ends that deﬁne the site of activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Polymerization of actin occurs from a pool of pre - existing G - actin and is not tightly coupled to depolymerization . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 22 The importance of regulation of coﬁlin by phosphorylation seems to vary by cell type . In some resting cells , coﬁlin is mostly phosphorylated ( Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) . Stimulation of motility by a variety of agents induces dephosphorylation and activation of coﬁlin ( Kanamori et al . , 1995 ; Okada et al . , 1996 ) . In carcinoma cells , at least half of coﬁlin is in the dephosphorylated state , and yet coﬁlin is inactive ( Chan et al . , 2000 ; Zebda et al . , 2000 ) . Furthermore , coﬁlin is rapidly phosphorylated upon epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) stimulation , which indicates a more complex regulatory mechanism than simply the dephosphorylation of coﬁlin ( Mouneimne et al . , 2004 ) . This is discussed below and shown in Fig . 2 . Hence , the dephosphorylation of coﬁlin by activation of coﬁlin phosphatases following N - formyl - methionyl - leucyl - phenylalanine ( fMLF ) stimulation , as observed in neutrophils ( Okada et al . , 1996 ; Suzuki et al . , 1995 ) , is unlikely to be the main regulatory pathway to coﬁlin activation in cultured cells . The protein 14 - 3 - 3 ζ binds to phosphorylated coﬁlin and prevents its dephosphorylation ( Gohla and Bokoch , 2002 ) and may thus be involved in regulating the phosphorylation state of coﬁlin . AIP1 also binds to coﬁlin ( Aizawa et al . , 1999 ; Okada et al . , 1999 ; Ono , 2003 ; Rodal et al . , 1999 ) and may stimulate the depolymerization activity of coﬁlin ( reviewed by Ono , 2003 ) . Tropomyosin The binding of tropomyosin to actin ﬁlaments prevents them from being depolymerized ( Bernstein and Bamburg , 1982 ) or severed ( DesMarais et al . , 2002 ) by coﬁlin . Tropomyosin also prevents the Arp2 / 3 complex from binding to ﬁlaments to initiate branches ( Blanchoin et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , tropomyosin may be able to restrict spatially the activities of coﬁlin and the Arp2 / 3 complex in vivo to certain populations of actin ﬁlaments in certain compartments of the cell ( reviewed by Cooper , 2002 ; Ono , 2003 ) . In the muscle cells of Caenorhabditis elegans , tropomyosin stabilizes actin ﬁlaments by protecting them from coﬁlin - mediated ﬁlament disassembly ( Ono and Ono , 2002 ) . In carcinoma cells , the dynamic nucleation zone at the leading edge of the lamellipod is enriched in coﬁlin and the Arp2 / 3 complex , but tropomyosin is depleted from this region of the cell and is present mainly on actin ﬁlaments in the cell body and on stress ﬁbers ( DesMarais et al . , 2002 ) . This allows the establishment of functionally distinct actin compartments in the cell , with rapid Journal of Cell Science 118 ( 1 ) gnireve s nitc a - F K S ET fc a fc i PAC fc a CLP noit a mrof dne - de b r a B FGE noit a gnole tnem a liF fc i H SS X 2P ) 5 , 4 ( IP GAD + In s ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) P 3 PC PAC KMIL / fc i = ?

A hypothetical model for the activity cycle of coﬁlin in crawling tissue cells . Some motile cells , such as neutrophils , regulate coﬁlin by dephosphoylation of an inactive phosphorylated pool upon chemotactic stimulation ( not shown ) . By contrast , others , such as carcinoma cells , might maintain the majority of coﬁlin prior to stimulation in a dephosphorylated yet inactive state ( cf i ) generated through interaction of coﬁlin with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and / or formation of coﬁlin – G - actin heterodimers . Following EGF stimulation , a PLC - dependent step releases activated coﬁlin ( cf a ) , which then associates with F - actin to promote F - actin severing . This leads both to polymerization and depolymerization , the balance being determined by the relative availability of G - actin . Coﬁlin is rescued from the coﬁlin – G - actin heterodimer by two mechanisms . ( 1 ) Phosphorylation by LIM kinase ( LIMK ) or TES kinase ( TESK ) turns off the actin - binding activity of cf , releasing G - actin and phospho - coﬁlin . Coﬁlin phosphatases such as PP1 , PP2A or SSH ( slingshot ) can then replenish the pool of dephosphorylated coﬁlin . ( 2 ) CAP can bind to the coﬁlin – G - actin heterodimer and release free coﬁlin and G - actin . The freed coﬁlin can bind to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to form an inhibitory complex that is released locally by EGF - stimulated receptors to begin the activity cycle again . Coﬁlin may bind directly to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or through another protein ( X ) . CAP is a candidate for X since it regulates coﬁlin location in vivo . Localized activation of coﬁlin by PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis causes local actin polymerization and protrusion , and sets the direction of movement . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 23 Coﬁlin regulates actin dynamics generation of actin barbed ends in the coﬁlin - and Arp2 / 3 - complex - rich leading edge compartment , and very little barbed - end formation in the tropomyosin - rich cell body . The regulation of actin dynamics by tropomyosin and coﬁlin might differ between cell types . Whereas in carcinoma cells and C . elegans muscle cells , tropomyosin and coﬁlin functions are antagonistic , in neuroblastoma cells that overexpress the tropomyosin isoform TM5 , the neuron - speciﬁc tropomyosin isoform TmBr3 , which binds to F - actin weakly ( Hammell and Hitchcock - DeGregori , 1996 ) , associates with coﬁlin - bound actin ﬁlaments ( Bryce et al . , 2003 ) . This suggests that some tropomyosin isoforms , such as TM5 , can speciﬁcally regulate the incorporation of other tropomyosin isoforms , such as TmBr3 , into actin ﬁlaments – for example , by selective dimerization . TmBr3 appears to be an example of a tropomyosin isoform that does not compete for actin binding with coﬁlin and thus may not limit coﬁlin activity . Cyclase - associated protein Coﬁlin binds to G - actin with micromolar affinity and the heterodimer is inactive in both severing and depolymerization ( Bamburg , 1999 ) . Recently , it was demonstrated that cyclase - associated protein ( CAP ) stimulates the release of coﬁlin from the coﬁlin – G - actin heterodimer ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ) and aids in the depolymerization of F - actin from the pointed end ( Balcer et al . , 2003 ; Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ) . CAP also seems to be able to support barbed - end elongation by enhancing the exchange of ADP - to ATP - actin ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ) . This in turn increases the rate of actin polymerization and depolymerization in vivo and determines the location of coﬁlin in crawling cells ( Bertling et al . , 2004 ) . Depletion of CAP expression leads to defects in ﬁlament turnover and cell polarity consistent with a role for coﬁlin in determining cell direction ( Bertling et al . , 2004 ) . The abundance of CAP , the fact that CAPs are highly conserved actin - binding proteins present in all eukaryotes , and the involvement of CAP in releasing coﬁlin from its inhibitory complex with G - actin make CAP a candidate for regulating the dephosphorylated population of coﬁlin in vivo in many cell types ( Fig . 2 ) . Phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate binding / phospholipase C γ Another mechanism of regulating coﬁlin function is through its binding to phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] , which inhibits the actin - binding activity of coﬁlin ( Ojala et al . , 2001 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1991 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1990 ) . This mechanism is particularly suitable for the spatial regulation of coﬁlin activity at the leading edge . Phospholipase C ( PLC ) is an important regulator of cell crawling ( Kassis et al . , 1999 ) . It is thought to remodel the actin cytoskeleton through PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis , leading to activation of coﬁlin ( Yonezawa et al . , 1991 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1990 ) , gelsolin ( Allen , 2003 ; Chou et al . , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 1999 ; Yonezawa et al . , 1990 ) and proﬁlin ( Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1992 ; Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1991 ) . Coﬁlin , proﬁlin and gelsolin are postulated to bind to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in an inhibitory complex in resting cells ; when released upon PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis , they locally remodel the actin cytoskeleton . Activated PLC γ 1 can hydrolyze PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 that is bound to proﬁlin , leading to its release and activation ( Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1991 ) . A similar mechanism might release coﬁlin from PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 upon EGF stimulation of carcinoma cells . Proﬁlin can support subsequent actin polymerization by facilitating nucleotide exchange and biasing actin monomers towards barbed - end polymerization ( dos Remedios et al . , 2003 ) . Gelsolin and coﬁlin affect actin polymerization by severing . Gelsolin severs actin ﬁlaments in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner and ﬁnishes by capping the barbed ends until membrane PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels are restored sufficiently to cause uncapping ( Sun et al . , 1999 ) . This is a relatively slow process ( with a half life of 15 minutes after growth factor stimulation ) ( Allen , 2003 ) and is inconsistent with gelsolin contributing to stimulation of protrusion , which occurs rapidly after receptor activation ( Mouneimne , 2004 ) . However , in some cell types , such as platelets and ﬁbroblasts , gelsolin appears to contribute to the generation of barbed ends since gelsolin - null platelets have 45 % fewer barbed ends after stimulation ( Falet et al . , 2002 ) . Actin assembly is also reduced in gelsolin - null platelets and ﬁbroblasts ( Azuma et al . , 1998 ; Falet et al . , 2000 ) . In other motile cells , such as carcinoma cells , a better case can be made for the involvement of coﬁlin in the rapid actin polymerization transients observed after stimulation , because of its fast response and the evidence discussed above implicating coﬁlin and the Arp2 / 3 complex as major contributors to production of barbed ends in these cells . Careful analysis of the timing of the contributions of coﬁlin and gelsolin to barbed - end production is needed to resolve their relative effects on stimulated and steady - state actin polymerization . In several cell types , stimulated cell motility requires a biphasic actin polymerization transient ( Chan et al . , 1998 ; Chen et al . , 2003 ; Cox et al . , 1992 ; Eddy et al . , 1997 ; Funamoto et al . , 2002 ; Hall et al . , 1989 ; Iijima and Devreotes , 2002 ) . Recent work ( Mouneimne et al . , 2004 ) has demonstrated that the early transient of barbed ends coincides with a peak of PLC activity and that both this PLC activity and coﬁlin activity are required for the early but not the late transient of barbed ends . More speciﬁcally , PLC activity is required for the protrusion of the cell towards a source of EGF , which indicates that PLC determines the directionality of the protrusion . Furthermore , inhibitor studies show that the activation of coﬁlin during the early transient requires PLC activity , suggesting that PLC regulates the early barbed - end transient through coﬁlin . By contrast , inhibition of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase activity suppresses the late but not the early transient , which is consistent with its involvement in the generation of protrusive force but not in the sensing of chemotactic signals ( Mouneimne et al . , 2004 ) . The physiological equivalent of local uncaging of coﬁlin ( Ghosh et al . , 2004 ) might therefore be the local hydrolysis of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by activated PLC γ , causing the release of active coﬁlin locally . In this scenario , the localized formation of new barbed ends by coﬁlin would lead to localized dendritic nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex and localized protrusion . This would set the direction of cell movement during chemotaxis . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 24 Conclusions Recent evidence indicates that coﬁlin controls sites of actin polymerization and protrusion . This places coﬁlin in the unexpected role of a decision maker during chemotaxis that helps to determine the direction of movement in response to a chemoattractant . Coﬁlin might also inﬂuence overall cell polarity by the same molecular mechanism , which involves its synergy with the Arp2 / 3 complex to stimulate dendritic nucleation . These considerations lead to two models for coﬁlin function in vivo : the stimulated and steady - state protrusion models . These models can explain how cells can change direction quickly in response to exogenous signals and switch to continuous , persistent motion in a single direction , using the same underlying machinery for generating protrusive force . The challenge for the future is to understand how coﬁlin is regulated with high spatial and temporal precision as the steering wheel of the cell . Supported by NIH38511 . References Agnew , B .
