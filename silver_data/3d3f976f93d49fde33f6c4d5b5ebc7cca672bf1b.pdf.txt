While the generation of this network is well studied , the mechanisms regulating network disassembly are poorly understood . We report that Coronin 1B disas - sembles Arp2 / 3 - containing actin ﬁlament branches by inducing Arp2 / 3 dissociation . This activity is an - tagonized by Cortactin , a ﬁlament branch stabilizer . Consistent with this biochemical competition , de - pletion of both proteins partially rescues defects in lamellipodial dynamics observed upon depletion of eitherproteinalone . Coronin1Btargetsactin branches in a manner that is mutually exclusive with the Arp2 / 3 complex and alters the branch angle . We conclude that Coronin 1B replaces the Arp2 / 3 complex at actin ﬁlament branches as the dendritic network matures and drives the turnover of branched actin networks . INTRODUCTION The migration of cells is required for morphogenesis , wound healing , cellular immune response , and establishing neuronal connections . Misregulated cell migration contributes to human disease , including metastasic cancers and compromised im - mune function . Dynamic cytoskeletal remodeling underlies cell migration , especially remodeling of actin ﬁlaments ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Filament nucleation is a key step during dynamic actin network formation and is catalyzed by the Arp2 / 3 complex , a highly conserved ﬁlament nucleator ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates actin ﬁlaments that branch from the sides of existing ﬁlaments and remains localized at branch junctions to maintain the dendritic structure of the network ( Mul - lins et al . , 1998 ; Svitkina andBorisy , 1999 ) . On itsown , theArp2 / 3 complex is inactive and requires accessory nucleation - promot - ing factors ( NPFs ) to nucleate ﬁlaments ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . NPFs are grouped into two categories ( Welch and Mullins , 2002 ) . Type I NPFs , such as WASP and SCAR / WAVE , directly activate the Arp2 / 3 complex by inducing conformational changes in the complex and supplying the ﬁrst actin monomer of the new ﬁlament . Type II NPFs , such as Cortactin , are weaker NPFs on their own but potently synergize with type I NPFs ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . Although branched ﬁlament formation by the Arp2 / 3 complex is well studied , the mechanisms for disassembling branched ﬁlament networks are poorly understood . At the back of lamelli - podia , ADF / Coﬁlin proteins ( hereafter referred to as Coﬁlin ) are thought to promote ﬁlament disassembly via severing and pos - sibly enhanced depolymerization ( Iwasa and Mullins , 2007 ; Svit - kina and Borisy , 1999 ) . Coﬁlin directly promotes debranching in vitro , although no data support this activity in vivo ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000 ) . Recent data indicate that branches emanating from ATP - actin - or ADP - Pi - actin - containing ﬁlaments are more stable than those emanating from ﬁlaments containing ADP ( Ma - haffy and Pollard , 2006 ) . ATP hydrolysis by the Arp2 subunit of yeast the Arp2 / 3 complex is required for actin patch internaliza - tion and efﬁcient spontaneous branch dissociation in vitro ( Martin et al . , 2006 ) . In contrast , Cortactin stabilizes Arp2 / 3 - dependent ﬁlament branches in vitro ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . De - pletion of Cortactin reduced dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons , decreased lamellipodial persistence and formation of invadopodia in cancer cells , impaired trans - epithelial migration , and reduced receptor internalization and pathogenic bacterial invasion ( reviewed in Cosen - Binker and Kapus , 2006 ) . All of these processes involve Arp2 / 3 - dependent branched actin networks , but the contribution of Cortactin’s branch - stabilizing activity to these processes has not been assessed in vivo . Coronins are a conserved family of actin - binding proteins that regulate cell motility in a variety of contexts ( Uetrecht and Bear , 2006 ) . Genetic deletion of Coronin 1A in mice leads to severe de - fects in the immune system including failure of T cell chemotaxis and homing to lymph nodes ( Foger et al . , 2006 ) . Coronin 1B , a ubiquitously expressed isoform , inﬂuences both lamellipodial protrusion and whole - cell motility ( Cai et al . , 2007b ) . Consistent with results using yeast Coronin ( Humphries et al . , 2002 ) , human Coronin 1B inhibits actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex , and 828 Cell 134 , 828 – 842 , September 5 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc .

Regulation of Coronin 1B by phosphor - ylation and dephosphorylation at serine 2 is orchestrated by PKC and Slingshot 1L , respectively ( Cai et al . , 2007b ) . However , the mechanistic details of Coronin’s inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex are unknown . In this work , we describe the molecular antago - nism between Coronin 1B and Cortactin at Arp2 / 3 - containing actin branches . RESULTS Coronin 1B and Cortactin Are Distinctly Localized in Lamellipodia and Interact with Different Pools of the Arp2 / 3 Complex To dissect the role of Coronin 1B in regulating the Arp2 / 3 com - plex in vivo , we examined its localization relative to Cortactin . Im - munolocalization of endogenous proteins reveals that Coronin 1B and Cortactin colocalize to a large extent in lamellipodia ( Fig - ure 1A ) . Using a contour - based analysis method , we plotted the distribution of Coronin 1B and Cortactin intensity as a function of distance from the cell edge ( Figure 1A ) ( Cai et al . , 2007a , 2007b ) . Coronin 1B and Cortactin overlap considerably ; however , Cor - tactin consistently localized closer to the leading edge than did Coronin 1B . Immunoelectron microscopy using different - sized gold conjugates conﬁrmed this result ( Figure 1B ) ; the peak of Coronin 1B occurred (cid:2) 800 nm from the cell edge , while most Cortactin localized (cid:2) 500 nm from the cell edge ( Figure 1C ) . Thus , we conclude that Coronin 1B and Cortactin have distinct distributions in lamellipodia . Both Coronin 1B and Cortactin bind directly to the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Cai et al . , 2007b ; Weed et al . , 2000 ) . To determine if Coronin 1B , Cortactin , and the Arp2 / 3 complex exist in the same complex in vivo , we examined the interactions of these components by immunoprecipitation ( Figure 1D ) . Both Coronin 1B and Cortactin reciprocally coimmunoprecipitate with the Arp2 / 3 complex , but the interaction between Coronin 1B and Cortactin is extremely weak , suggesting that these proteins interact with different pools of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Coronin 1B and Cortactin Exert Opposing Activities on Lamellipodial Dynamics The different cellular distributions and interactions with the Arp2 / 3 complex for Coronin 1B and Cortactin prompted us to ex - amine a functional interaction by comparing the effects of de - pleting each protein , both singly and in combination . Since both proteins are concentrated at the leading edge , we analyzed lamellipodial protrusion dynamics in depleted cells . As ex - pected , depletion of either Coronin 1B or Cortactin reduces pro - trusion persistence ( Figure 1F ) ( Bryce et al . , 2005 ; Cai et al . , 2007b ) . Depletion of either protein also reduced protrusion dis - tance ( Figure 1E ) . Interestingly , cells depleted of both Coronin 1B and Cortactin exhibit increased protrusion persistence and distance relative to cells depleted of only one of these proteins ( Figures 1E and 1F ) but a protrusion rate lower than cells de - pleted of either protein ( Figure 1G ) . Thus , Coronin 1B and Cor - tactin exert opposing effects on some ( but not all ) parameters of lamellipodial dynamics . These data suggest that Coronin 1B and Cortactin may have antagonistic effects on actin dynamics . Coronin 1B Antagonizes Cortactin In Vitro Coronin 1B inhibits VCA - induced Arp2 / 3 nucleation activity , but high concentrations are required ( IC 50 z 1 m M ) ( Cai et al . , 2007b ) . We examined whether Coronin 1B also inhibits type II NPFs such as Cortactin that synergize with VCA ( Figure S2C available online ) . Coronin 1B potently inhibited actin nucleation induced by Cortactin and VCA in a dose - dependent manner ( Figures 2A and 2B ) . We estimate that Coronin 1B inhibits the Cortactin component of Cortactin / VCA - induced activation of Arp2 / 3 with a half - maximal concentration of 71 nM ( Figure 2B ) . In addition , Coronin 1B inhibits activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by Cortactin alone ( Figures S2E and S2F ) . To determine the structural requirements for Coronin 1B’s inhibition of Cortactin , we tested mutant Coronin 1B proteins . Coronin 1B R30D ( which binds the Arp2 / 3 complex but not F - actin ) weakly inhibits Arp2 / 3 nucleation stimulated by Cortac - tin and VCA ( half - maximal concentration of (cid:2) 11 m M ) ( Figure S2D ) and does not inhibit Arp2 / 3 activation by Cortactin alone ( Figures Figure 2 .

Pellet samples were obtained and processed as in ( A ) . 832 Cell 134 , 828 – 842 , September 5 , 2008 ª 2008 Elsevier Inc . S2E and S2F ) . Coronin 1B R30D also does not inhibit VCA - dependent Arp2 / 3 complex activity ( Figure S2A ) . Thus , F - actin binding is essential for all of Coronin 1B’s known biochemical activities . Coronin 1B S2D , a mutant defective in binding Arp2 / 3 ( Cai et al . , 2005 , 2007b ) , had no effect on the synergistic activation of Arp2 / 3 by VCA and Cortactin or by Cortactin alone ( Figures S2D – S2F ) . Thus , Coronin 1B must bind both Arp2 / 3 and F - actin to antagonize Cortactin in vitro . Coronin 1B Destabilizes Actin Filament Branches and Competes with Branch Stabilization by Cortactin To clarify the mechanism of Coronin 1B’s inhibition of Arp2 / 3 nucleation , we used total internal reﬂection microscopy ( TIRF ) to monitor branching actin polymerization in real time ( Amann and Pollard , 2001 ) . In the presence of 50nM Coronin 1B , total ac - tin polymer was reduced and branching was less extensive than in control reactions ( Figure 2C ) . To ensure that the decreased amount of actin ﬁlaments was not due to decreased rate of ﬁla - ment elongation at barbed ends , we quantiﬁed the ﬁlament elon - gation rate by kymography ( Kuhn and Pollard , 2005 ) . Coronin 1B didnotaltertherateofﬁlamentelongation ( FiguresS3AandS3B ) . Examination of the TIRF movies revealed that the decreased branching observed in the presence of Coronin 1B was ex - plained , in part , by instability of branches . In reactions without Coronin 1B , most branches remained stable throughout the course of the experiment ( Figure 2D , upper panels ) . In contrast , 50 nM Coronin 1B induced dissociation of daughter and mother ﬁlaments at a high frequency , suggesting that Coronin 1B desta - bilizes ﬁlament branches ( Figure 2D , Movies S1 – S4 ) . Weusedtwomethodstoquantifydebranching . Sincethelength of the daughter ﬁlament is proportional to the time since branch formation , weestimated debranching frequencyfromdaughterﬁl - ament length measurements at the time of dissociation . Coronin 1Bincreasedthefrequencyofdebranching ( Figure2E ) . Inaddition , we also counted actin branches formed over time in the presence of various concentrations of Coronin 1Band Cortactin . Addition of 42 nM Cortactin increased the rate of actin branch formation rela - tive to that promoted by VCA alone ( Figure 2F ) . Addition of 56 nM Coronin 1B to reactions containing either VCA or 42 nM Cortactin suppressed the rate of actin branch formation ; this inhibition was reversed by increasing amounts of Cortactin . Conversely , in - creased amounts of Coronin 1B overcame the branch - promot - ing / protection effect of Cortactin ( Figure S3D ) . Since Cortactin both enhances nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 com - plex and stabilizes actin ﬁlament branches ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) , we developed a second - wave debranching assay to further dis - sect Coronin 1B’s effect on branching ( Figure 2G ) . In this assay , a preformed branched network intiated by the Arp2 / 3 complex and VCA ( ﬁrst - wave ) was incubated with various debranching / branch stabilization factors ( second - wave ) ( treatments a – f , Fig - ures 2G and 2H ) in the absence of G - actin , VCA , and Arp2 / 3 to prevent formation of additional branched ﬁlaments . After 2 min , the reactions were stopped by ﬂushing the chamber with Rhoda - mine - phalloidin and the number of branched ﬁlaments per total ﬁlament length were counted . Coronin 1B decreased the density of actin branches ( reactions b and c ) and Cortactin increased the density of actin branches ( reaction d ) . Furthermore , Coronin 1B reversed branch stabilization by Cortactin ( reactions e and f ) . Together , these data indicate that Cortactin and Coronin 1B affect actin branches in a manner that is independent of the initial nucleation event . Coronin 1B Induces Dissociation of the Arp2 / 3 Complex from Sides of Actin Filaments To further characterize the effects of Coronin 1B on branch stability , we used centrifugation to separate and quantify the fraction of the Arp2 / 3 complex associated with actin ﬁlaments in nucleation reactions ( Figure 3A ) . Increasing amounts of Coro - nin 1B decreased the amount of the Arp2 / 3 complex associated with F - actin ; Cortactin overcame this effect of Coronin 1B and increased the amount of the Arp2 / 3 complex associated with F - actin . Coronin 1B - induced Arp2 / 3 dissociation was indepen - dent of VCA activation since Coronin 1B also induced dissocia - tion of Arp2 / 3 from the sides of preformed ﬁlaments ( Figures 3B – 3E ) . Cortactin competes with Coronin 1B - induced dissociation ( Figure 3E ) . Identical results were obtained with ﬁlaments nucle - ated by Spectrin - F - actin seeds ( SAS ) , excluding a potential role of pointed end - Arp2 / 3 interactions in this assay . Quantitative immunoblotting indicated that Coronin 1B in - duced Arp2 / 3 dissociation from F - actin with a half - maximal concentration of 74 nM ( Figures 3F and 3H ) , while Cortactin in - creased the association of Arp2 / 3 with F - actin in a saturable manner with a half - maximal concentration of 51 nM ( Figures 3G and S2B ) , consistent with its ability to stabilize actin branches . To test the molecular requirements for Coronin 1B’s Arp2 / 3 - dissociating activity , we examined different mutants of Coronin 1B . Coronin 1B S2D ( defective in Arp2 / 3 binding ) had (cid:2) 2 - fold lower Arp2 / 3 - dissociating activity , while Coronin 1B R30D ( defective in F - actin binding ) had (cid:2) 5 - fold lower activity ( Figure 3H ) . Finally , a double mutant , Coronin 1B S2D , R30D ( DD ) , did not dissociate the Arp2 / 3 complex from F - actin ( Figure 3H ) . Thus , both Arp2 / 3 binding and F - actin binding are required for Coronin 1B to efﬁciently dissociate the Arp2 / 3 complex from ﬁlaments . One possible explanation for the antag - onism between Coronin 1B and Cortactin in these biochemical assays is that both proteins compete for a common binding site on F - actin . We performed actin cosedimentation assays with varying amounts of Coronin 1B and ﬁxed amounts of Cortactin or vise versa . Coronin 1B and Cortactin can simulta - neously bind to actin ﬁlaments ( Figures 3I and 3J ) . ( G ) Reactions as in ( F ) with varying concentrations of Cortactin .

Coronin 1B Localizes to Actin Branches Both In Vitro and In Vivo To characterize the effects of Coronin 1B on actin branches , we used negative staining and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) to visualize actin branches in the presence of Coronin 1B . The branch angle between mother and daughter ﬁlaments was not altered by Cortactin ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . In contrast , Co - ronin 1B perturbs the structure of branched ﬁlaments ( Figure 4A , yellow arrowheads ) , increasing the angle between the mother and daughter ﬁlaments ( Figure 4B ) . Since Coronin 1B affects branch dynamics and alters the branch angle , we postulated that Coronin 1B must localize to actin branches . To test this idea , ﬂuorescently labeled Coronin 1B was added to reactions containing preformed Arp2 / 3 branches . Fluorescent Coronin 1B preferentially localized to ac - tin branches ( Figure 4C ) . Infrequently , we observed that actin branches disassembled after binding Coronin 1B ( see Movie S5 ) . To conﬁrm the localization of Coronin 1B to branches , we used immunogold labeling in conjunction with negative staining and TEM . Immunogold labeling for Coronin 1B using two different an - tibodies preferentially decorated actin branches ( Figure 4D , 1 – 2 ) . When 6 nm gold particles were used , we observed many gold particles at a single branch , suggesting that Coronin 1B may be multimeric at branches . As expected , the Arp2 / 3 complex and Cortactin are also localized to actin branches ( Figure 4D , 3 – 4 ) . We also examined the colocalization of Arp2 / 3 , Cortactin , and Coronin 1B at branches using double labeling with two dif - ferent - sized gold particles . Simultaneous labeling of the Arp2 / 3 complex and Cortactin identiﬁed many branches containing both proteins ( Figures 4D , 5 – 6 and 4E ) , consistent with reports that Cortactin remains associated with branches after nucleation ( Egile et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast , with antibodies to Arp2 / 3 and Coronin 1B , we observed only one doubly labeled branch out of nearly 1000 branches examined ( Figure 4E , Table S1 ) . To ex - clude the possibility that the Coronin 1B and Arp2 / 3 antibodies did not simultaneously label branches due to steric hindrance , we tested alternate Arp2 / 3 complex antibodies . Again , no doubly labeled branches were observed . In the absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex , Coronin 1B does not induce the formation of end - to - side branches ( data not shown ) . Thus , the Arp2 / 3 complex and Coronin 1B are mutually exclusive at branches in vitro . We con - clude that Coronin 1B targets pre - existing Arp2 / 3 - containing branches and replaces the Arp2 / 3 complex . To determine if Coronin 1B localizes to branches in vivo , we used immunogold staining in conjunction with platinum replica electron microscopy ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . Coronin 1B lo - calized to actin branches in vivo ( Figures 4F , S6 , and S8 ) , as did the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 4H , S5 , and S7 ) . Coronin 1B also was detected at ﬁlament junctions containing multiple actin ﬁla - ments . To better visualize single actin branches , we decreased the density of the actin network with low doses of cytochalasin D ( Figure 4G ) . In these conditions , Coronin 1B was localized at single ﬁlament branches . To determine the geometry of actin ﬁlament branches associated with either the Arp2 / 3 complex or Coronin 1B , we measured the angle of labeled branches ( Figure 4I ) . Arp2 / 3 - labeled junctions branch at an angle of 72 . 5 (cid:3) ( mode ) with a fairly normal Gaussian distribution of values , whereas the majority of Coronin 1B - labeled junctions branch at larger angles ( mode = 85 (cid:3) ) . Interestingly , a signiﬁcant fraction of Coronin 1B - labeled branch junctions are more acute than Arp2 / 3 branches , suggesting that these branches may be more ﬂexible . Thus , Coronin 1B localizes at the junctions of branched actin ﬁlaments in vivo and the majority of those junc - tions are oriented at larger angles than Arp2 / 3 - containing branches . Targeting Active Coronin 1B to the Plasma Membrane Reduces Arp2 / 3 Branching and Alters Lamellipodial Dynamics To further investigate how Coronin 1B regulates dendritic actin networks , we targeted Coronin 1B to the plasma membrane where it is not normally located . Coronin 1B - GFP was engi - neered to contain a CAAX sequence to direct membrane target - ing ( WT - GAAX ; Figures 5A and 5B ) . Interestingly , we discovered that WT - GAAX becomes phosphorylated on Ser2 , a site that negatively regulates Coronin 1B activity by decreasing the inter - action between Coronin 1B and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 5C ) ( Cai et al . , 2005 , 2007b ) . Phospho - WT - GAAX accumulates , in part , because membrane - targeted Coronin 1B cannot be dephosphorylated ( Figure S9 ) . ( B ) Angles between the mother and daughter ﬁlaments were quantiﬁed and presented as mean ± 95 % CI .

To circumvent this inhibitory phosphorylation , we targeted a nonphosphorylatable mutant of Coronin 1B ( S2A - GAAX ) to the plasma membrane ( Figures 5D and S9B ) . Arp2 / 3 complex staining in lamellipodia was reduced in cells expressing S2A - GAAX ( Figure 5D ) . We used a ratiometric variant of our con - tour - based quantitative immunoﬂuorescence assay to measure the ratio of Arp2 / 3 to F - actin as a function of distance from the leading edge ( Figures 5E and 5F ) . The ratio of Arp2 / 3 to F - actin was reduced in cells expressing S2A - GAAX relative to that in cells expressing WT - GAAX or in uninfected control cells ( data not shown ) . Platinum replicas were used to examine the archi - tecture of actin ﬁlaments in the lamellipodia . Consistent with the immunoﬂuorescent analysis , expression of S2A - GAAX reduces the density of the actin network in the lamellipodia relative to that observed in cells expressing WT - GAAX ( Figures 5G – 5I and S10 ) . To test the functional signiﬁcance of Coronin 1B - induced changes in Arp2 / 3 branch density , we quantiﬁed lamellipodial dynamics in cells expressing soluble Coronin 1B - GFP or mem - brane - targeted Coronin 1Bs ( Figures 5J – 5L ) . Expression of soluble Coronin 1B - GFP did not alter lamellipodial dynamics . Expression of WT - GAAX induced a slight but signiﬁcant increase in protrusion rate and a slight decrease in protrusion persistence . Expression of S2A - GAAX increased protrusion rate and decreased protrusion persistence , as well as signiﬁcantly de - creased protrusion distance ( Figures 5J – 5L ) . Thus , inappropriate localization of active Coronin 1B to the plasma membrane alters Arp2 / 3 branch density in the lamellipodia and affects protrusion dynamics at the leading edge . Coronin 1B and the Arp2 / 3 Complex Exhibit Sequential Spatiotemporal Dynamics in Lamellipodia To study the relative spatial and temporal dynamics of actin , Co - ronin 1B , Cortactin , and the Arp2 / 3 complex in lamellipodia , we used live - cell imaging of cells expressing functional ﬂuorescent fusion proteins expressed in cells depleted of the endogenous proteins ( Figure S11 ) . F - actin assembled in periodic bursts at the leading edge and , together with other actin - associated pro - teins , moved rearward by retrograde ﬂow . Kymography was used to assess the rate of retrograde ﬂow and distance traveled during retrograde ﬂow for each protein . Actin , Cortactin , Coronin 1B , and the Arp2 / 3 complex exhibited similar retrograde ﬂow rates ( Figures 6A and 6C ) ; however , each of these proteins trav - eled a distinct distance from the leading edge during retrograde ﬂow . Actin traveled the longest distance and Cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 complex traveled the shortest distance . Coronin 1B trav - eled nearly twice as far from the leading edge as Cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 6B ) . These data are consistent with previous observations that Coronin 1B extends deeper into the lamellipodia than either the Arp2 / 3 complex or Cortactin ( Cai et al . , 2007a ) . We also performed correlation analysis between Coronin 1B , Cortactin , and the Arp2 / 3 complex along the cell margin using dual - color live - cell imaging . Notably , the Arp2 / 3 complex was distributed closer to the leading edge than Coronin 1B ( Figures 6D and S11A ) . To quantify these correlations , we adapted the contour - based pixel intensity extraction technique to calculate Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient for pairwise combinations of proteins in different regions of the lamellipodium ( Figure 6E ) . Consistent with our biochemical experiments , the distributions of Coronin 1B and Cortactin are poorly correlated across the lamellipodia with the lowest value near the cell margin , while those of Cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 complex are highly correlated across the entire lamellipodium ( Figure 6E ) . To assess the spatiotemporal relationships for Arp2 / 3 , Coro - nin 1B , and Cortactin at a single location in the lamellipodium , we used kymographs generated from dual - color movies . As ex - pected , Cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 complex are highly correlated in both space and time ( Figures 6F and 6H ) . Interestingly , Coro - nin 1B and Arp2 / 3 exhibited sequential dynamics within the lamellipodium . Each Arp2 / 3 complex - rich region close to the membrane was gradually enriched with Coronin 1B concomitant with Arp2 / 3 complex depletion with distance from the leading edge ( red / green line scans , Figure 6G ) . Coronin 1B never accu - mulated without a pre - existing concentration of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex , supporting the notion that Coronin 1B speciﬁcally targets Arp2 / 3 - containing branches and replaces Arp2 / 3 at branched junctions . These qualitative observations are conﬁrmed by Pearson’s correlation analysis ( Figure 6H ) . Depletion of Coronin 1B and Cortactin Interferes with Retrograde Flow of Actin and the Arp2 / 3 Complex We also visualized the dynamics of actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex in Coronin 1B - or Cortactin - depleted cells using two - color kymo - graphs ( Figure 7A ) . In general , depletion of either protein reduced the distance traveled and the retrograde ﬂow rate of actin ( Figures 7B – 7D ) . Thus , both Coronin 1B and Cortactin are required for normal dynamics of lamellipodial actin . Cortactin depletion decreased the distance that the Arp2 / 3 complex traveled rearward ( Figures 7B , 7E , and 7F ) , consistent with the in vitro branch stabilization activity of this protein . Interestingly , depletion of Cortactin increased the retrograde ﬂow rate of Arp2 / 3 , suggesting that Cortactin retards Arp2 / 3 - actin branch movement in lamellipodia . Several interesting features of the coordinate dynamics of actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex in lamellipodia were noted . If all of the actin in lamellipodia were in the form of Arp2 / 3 - containing branched actin ﬁlaments , then actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex should exhibit similar dynamics . However , actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex exhibit distinct distributions of retrograde ﬂow rates and distances traveled in control cells ( Figure 7B , left panel ) .

In contrast , depletion of Cortactin leads to divergence in the dynamic prop - erties of actin and Arp2 / 3 ( Figure 7B , right panel ) . We tested the covariance between the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin dynamics to quantitatively assess the effects of depleting Coronin 1B and Cortactin on the kinematics of actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex . Control cells and Cortactin - depleted cells exhibit divergent dynamics of Arp2 / 3 and actin , but Coronin 1B - depleted cells shownosigniﬁcantdifferenceinthecovarianceofthesemarkers . DISCUSSION In this work we show that Coronin 1B antagonizes Cortactin in vitro and in vivo . Furthermore , we show that Coronin 1B remodels Arp2 / 3 - containing actin branches and plays an impor - tant role in coordinating actin dynamics within lamellipodia . Antagonism between Coronin 1B and Cortactin One of the most striking observations we made in this work is that Coronin 1B potently antagonizes Cortactin and vice versa . In lamellipodia , these proteins are localized in distinct patterns and interact with distinct pools of the Arp2 / 3 complex , with little interaction between the pools . Coronin 1B and Cortactin com - pete in multiple biochemical assays in vitro and in functional analysis in vivo . This competition is not due solely to competition for binding to F - actin but also involves Arp2 / 3 binding . Future studies will focus on deﬁning the precise molecular interactions required for this competition . While the competition between Coronin 1B and Cortactin in vitro was efﬁcient , results for cellular experiments suggest a more complex interaction between these proteins in vivo . The incomplete rescue observed upon double depletion of these proteins indicates that Coronin 1B and Cor - tactin each participate in additional functions within lamellipodia . Coronin 1B Remodels the Arp2 / 3 - Containing Actin Network Remodeling of the Arp2 / 3 - containing dendritic network by Coro - nin 1B may generate a second actin network with distinct prop - erties . Our data from dual - color live - cell imaging indicate that the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin have different dynamics within lamel - lipodia . Lamellipodial actin ﬂows rearward to a greater extent than the Arp2 / 3 complex in ﬁbroblasts . These results are consis - tent with recent observations from Drosophila S2 cells obtained using speckle microscopy ( Iwasa and Mullins , 2007 ) . Intriguingly , depleting Coronin 1B leads to near perfect synchronization of Arp2 / 3 and actin dynamics in lamellipodia . Taken together with our biochemical data and observations of branch angles in vivo , we conclude that Coronin 1B remodels Arp2 / 3 - contain - ing branches into a new network that is free of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Other studies have identiﬁed diverse and seemingly independent actin networks within lamellipodia ( Ponti et al . , 2004 ) . Future studies will be required to delineate the role of Coronin 1B - mediated actin remodeling in generating diversity in lamellipodial actin networks . What advantage might remodeling the lamellipodial actin network provide the cell ? First , this mechanism allows efﬁcient recycling of the Arp2 / 3 complex for continued branched ﬁlament nucleation at the leading edge . Although the cytosolic concen - tration of Arp2 / 3 is high ( Pollard et al . , 2000 ) , autocatalytic branching could locally deplete the Arp2 / 3 complex and stall or delay dendritic network assembly . Replacing Coronin 1B at branch junctions would allow continued branch formation while maintaining existing branched ﬁlaments . Second , Coronin 1B provides the ﬂexibility to either maintain branches or initiate branch disassembly on demand if Slingshot is recruited ( Cai et al . , 2007b ) . Finally , having both Cortactin - stabilized Arp2 / 3 branch junctions and Coronin 1B - branched ﬁlaments in lamelli - podia allows differential coupling of the actin network to cellular structures such as nascent adhesions or trafﬁcking vesicles . Regulation of Coronin 1B Branch - Remodeling Activity Branch remodeling by Coronin 1B is extremely potent in vitro , implying that a strict regulation of this activity likely operates in vivo . Our membrane - targeting experiments revealed a possi - ble mechanism for regulating branch remodeling . Previously , we showed that PKC phosphorylation of Ser2 on Coronin 1B reduced binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Cai et al . , 2005 ) . Upon membrane targeting , Ser2 of Coronin 1B became phosphory - lated and Arp2 / 3 interaction was strongly reduced , consistent with reports of a constitutively active , plasma membrane - resi - dent pool of PKC ( Gallegos et al . , 2006 ) . Our pharmacological experiments revealed that WT - GAAX is hyperphosphorylated at Ser2 because membrane - targeted Coronin 1B could not be efﬁciently dephosphorylated by Slingshot 1L . This result indi - rectly suggests that activation of Coﬁlin by dephosphorylation also may not occur at the plasma membrane . Membrane targeting of nonphosphorylatable Coronin 1B ( S2A ) reduced the density of Arp2 / 3 branches in the dendritic network . Localizing active Coronin 1B to the site where Arp2 / 3 - containing actin branches are generated may inhibit stable ( E ) Line proﬁles were extracted as described in ( D ) for pairwise combinations of labeled proteins .

Future studies will examine how targeting of Coronins controls membrane - associated actin dynamics in normal and pathophysiological circumstances . A Working Model for Coronin 1B Function Based on data presented here and on our previous work , we pro - pose the following speculative model to explain the role of Coro - nin 1B in branched actin remodeling / disassembly ( Figure S12 ) . Near the plasma membrane , the activated Arp2 / 3 complex nu - cleates a new ﬁlament on the side of an existing ﬁlament , forming a branched junction . Cortactin associates with Arp2 / 3 - contain - ing branches , protecting them from spontaneous disassembly . Coronin 1B targets Arp2 / 3 - containing actin branches in an antagonistic fashion with Cortactin . Targeting by Coronin 1B re - quires both F - actin and Arp2 / 3 binding for maximum efﬁciency and involves multimeric Coronin 1B complexes . Subsequently , the Arp2 / 3 complex dissociates from the branch , leaving multi - mers of Coronin 1B in its place . Coronin 1B branches have a larger , but more variable angle than Arp2 / 3 branches . Previ - ously , we showed that Coronin 1B binds Slingshot 1L , the acti - vating phosphatase of Coﬁlin ( Cai et al . , 2007b ) . Recruitment of Slingshot 1L by Coronin 1B brings it into close proximity to F - actin , an essential cofactor for its activation . Slingshot 1L ac - tivation leads to local dephosphorylation and activation of Coﬁ - lin . Active Coﬁlin promotes the release of inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) from actin ﬁlaments to which it binds . Since Coronin 1B binds with (cid:2) 50 - fold lower afﬁnity to ADP - F - actin than it does to ATP or ADP - Pi - F - actin ( Cai et al . , 2007a ) , local Pi release would lead to disassembly of Coronin 1B - containing branches . In addition , locally activated Coﬁlin may promote ﬁlament turnover via its severing activity in the vicinity of the recently disassembled branch . This model provides a mechanism for Coronin 1B function in promoting turnover of Arp2 / 3 - branched actin networks . Although our studies have focused on lamellipodia , the mechanism of Coronin function revealed by these experi - ments likely applies to all Arp2 / 3 - branched networks such as those found on endosomes , in dendritic spines , or in phagocytic cups . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Descriptionsofplasmidconstruction , cellculture , andantibodies / reagentsare in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Immunoprecipitations were performed using standard conditions ( Cai et al . , 2007b ) ; additional details are included in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures . TIRF and Other In Vitro Actin Assays Recombinant and native proteins were prepared as described ( Cai et al . , 2007b ) . TIRF - based actin - branching assay was performed as previously described ( Amann and Pollard , 2001 ; Kuhn and Pollard , 2005 ) . Brieﬂy , glass coverslips and paraﬁlm spacers were used to prepare imaging chambers . NEM - inactivated myosin was used to immobilize actin ﬁlaments . Protein mixutres were diluted in freshly prepared TIRF imaging buffer ( 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA , 20 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 30 mM glucose , 1 % 4000 cP methylcellulose , 200 mM DTT , 0 . 4 mM ATP , 40 m g / ml catalase , 200 m g / ml glucose oxidase ) and imaged at 5 or 10 s intervals by objective based TIRF microscopy . Under standard conditions , 0 . 5 m M actin ( 30 % Oregon green labeled ) was nucleated in the presence of 13 . 3 nM Arp2 / 3 and 13 . 3 nM VCA . To calculate debranching frequency , the length of the daughter ﬁlament was measured in ImageJ at the moment of its release from the mother ﬁlament . Debranching frequency = ( barbed end elongation rate ) / ( debranched ﬁlament length ) . Second - wave debranching was per - formed as described : First , reactions were initiated by mixing 0 . 5 m M G - ac - tin with 13 . 3 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and 13 . 3 nM GST - VCA and incubated for 10 min to form actin branches inside the imaging chamber . Protein mixtures in TIRF imaging buffer ( all including 0 . 8 m M capping protein ) were ﬂushed into the reaction chambers and incubated for 2 min . Control experiments conﬁrmed that this procedure completely removed the residual VCA and G - actin from the ﬁrst step and blocked further branched nucleation . Finally , Rhodamine - phalloidin ( 1 . 5 m M ) was ﬂushed into the chamber to stop the reactions and stain the actin ﬁlaments . Detailed methods for actin cosedi - mentation - based assays ( e . g . , Arp2 / 3 dissociation assay ) and pyrene actin assembly assays are described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Electron Microscopy Negative staining was performed using 2 % ( w / v ) uranyl acetate of samples on glowdischargedcarbongrids ( invitrosamples ) orﬁbronectin - coatedColloidin grids ( cells ) . Immunogold staining was performed using primary and second - ary antibodies as described in the legends . The grids were examined in a Phi - lips CM12 microscope . The images were taken at magniﬁcation 10 , 000 3 or 45 , 000 3 on Kodak SO - 163ﬁlm , scannedat resolution 2500dpi , and adjusted for publication using Photoshop . Platinum replica EM was performed as described ( Cai et al . , 2007b ) . For immunogold labeling of platinum replicas , the extraction buffer was modiﬁed to preserve Coronin 1B staining as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Light Microscopy For immunoﬂuorescent staining , the cells were ﬁxed , stained , and mounted as described ( Cai et al . , 2007b ) . Images were captured using a spinning disk confocal scan head ( Yokogawa CSU - 10 ) attached to an inverted micro - scope ( IX - 81 , Olympus ) and a CCD camera ( OCAR - ERG , Hamamatsu ) and controlled by either Andor iQ or Slidebook software . Lamellipodial dynamics were analyzed using phase - contrast kymography as described ( Cai et al . , 2007b ) . Retrograde ﬂow analysis was performed using movies captured by spinning disk confocal microscopy ( 1 s interval , 1 3 1 binning for single - chan - nel signal ; 2 s interval , 2 3 2 binning for dual - color signal ) . Kymographs were generated from these movies and analyzed to calculate the retrograde ﬂow rate and the distance traveled as described in the legend . Image and Statistical Analysis Branch angle measurement was performed using ImageJ . Pearson’s correla - tion coefﬁcient was computed from regions of interest extracted using ImageJ and calculated based on normalized intensities in Excel . Other statistical analyses were performed using Prism .
