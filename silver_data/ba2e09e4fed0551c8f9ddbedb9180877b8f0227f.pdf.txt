Latham , * Max A . Horlbeck , Jennifer G . D ’ Arcangelo , Elizabeth A . Miller † Eukaryotic secretory proteins exit the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) via transport vesicles generated by the essential coat protein complex II ( COPII ) proteins . The outer coat complex , Sec13 - Sec31 , forms a scaffold that is thought to enforce curvature . By exploiting yeast bypass - of - sec - thirteen ( bst ) mutants , where Sec13p is dispensable , we probed the relationship between a compromised COPII coat and the cellular context in which it could still function . Genetic and biochemical analyses suggested that Sec13p was required to generate vesicles from membranes that contained asymmetrically distributed cargoes that were likely to confer opposing curvature . Thus , Sec13p may rigidify the COPII cage and increase its membrane - bending capacity ; this function could be bypassed when a bst mutation renders the membrane more deformable . H ierarchical assembly of the COPII coat on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane couples cargo selection withmembrane deformation to generate functional transport vesicles ( 1 ) . All members of the COPII coat are thought to contribute to gen - eration of membrane curvature ( 2 , 3 ) ; however , the precise mechanism of membrane deforma - tion by the COPII coat remains unclear ( 4 ) . We sought to probe this process by dissecting the molecular function of the outer coat complex , composed of Sec13 and Sec31 , which is thought to drive membrane curvature by polymerization into a latticelike spherical structure ( 3 ) . Sec13 is unique among COPII proteins in performing multiple functions , driven by structurally anal - ogous interactions with distinct partners , includ - ing its canonical partner Sec31 ( 5 ) , the nucleoporin Nup145 ( 6 ) , and the COPII scaffold Sec16 ( 7 ) . Given the pleiotropic functions of Sec13 and the essential nature of COPII - mediated traffic , it is surprising that yeast Sec13p is dispensable in the context of bypass - of - sec - thirteen ( bst ) mutations ( 8 , 9 ) . We sought to exploit this phenotype to probe vesicle formation in the context of a com - promised coat complex . The COPII “ cage ” self - assembles from rod - shaped Sec13 - Sec31 edge elements , four of which come together at vertex regions ( 3 ) . Sec31 is thought to drive assembly : The edge element is formed by stable dimerization at the a - solenoid ancestral coat element ( ACE ) domain ; four edge elements come together at cage vertices via N - terminal b propellers ( 5 ) . Sec13 lies sandwiched between the ACE and b - propeller domains , forming a six - bladed b propeller that is comple - mented by an additional b blade formed by the domain insertion motif ( DIM ) of Sec31 ( Fig . 1A ) . We first demonstrated that the essential function of yeast Sec13p was in the COPII coat by restricting its interaction to Sec31p ( 10 ) : An in - frame fusion where Sec13p was inserted im - mediately downstream of the Sec31p DIM com - plementedboth sec13 D and sec31 D strains , whereas a fusion containing the Sec13p structural homo - log , Seh1p , was unable to support viability ( Fig . 1B ) despite being functional in a bst D background ( fig . S1 ) . Furthermore , uncoupling Sec13p from the COPII coat by mutation of the Sec31p DIM , either by point mutations ( sec31 - DK ) or by com - plete replacement with a 13 amino acid stretch of Gly - Ser repeats ( sec31 - GS 13 ) , failed to support viability except in the context of an additional bst1 D mutation ( Fig . 1C ) , effectively mimicking a sec13 D mutation . WeinvestigatedwhetherSec31p could engage with the COPII coat independent of Sec13p . Indeed , Sec31p , expressed and purified from insect cells to preclude copurification of Sec13p , was efficiently recruited to synthetic li - posomes in the presence of the inner COPII coat , Sar1p - Sec23p - Sec24p ( Fig . 1D ) . Furthermore , the Sec31p DIM mutants also assembled with the inner coat but were unable to recruit Sec13p ( Fig . 1D ) . Finally , we used an in vitro vesicle forma - tion assay ( 11 ) to confirm that Sec31p was suf - ficient to generate COPII vesicles in the absence of Sec13p , albeit with reduced efficiency ( Fig . 1E ) . If Sec31p can generate COPII vesicles on its own , what is the molecular function of Sec13p and what are the in vivo conditions created by the bst mutations that permit Sec31p to function in its absence ? We used synthetic genetic array technology ( 12 ) to exhaustively survey the yeast genome for BST genes . Two query mutations — sec31 - GS 13 and sec13 D — were introduced into the yeast deletion collection , and haploid double mutants were scored for viability ( Fig . 2A and fig . S2 ) .

Many of these overlapping hits were false positives , and a few were ambiguous because their phenotypes were too weak to be conclusive - ly confirmed ( Fig . 2A and fig . S3 ) . Our screens thus yielded seven core bst mutants , and by direct testing we identified three additional functionally related hits ( Fig . 2 , A to C ) . The majority of BST gene products fell into two functional categories ( Fig . 2B ) : Bst1p , Ted1p , Per1p , and Gup1p are ER enzymes that catalyze remodeling of glycosylphosphatidyl - inositol ( GPI ) anchors after proteins have been covalently attached ( 13 , 14 ) ; Emp24p , Erv25p , Erp1p , and Erp2p are members of the p24 fam - ily and form a physical complex that shuttles between the ER and the Golgi apparatus and is required for efficient ER export of GPI - anchored proteins ( GPI - APs ) ( 9 , 15 , 16 ) . Maturation of the GPI - AP , Gas1p , was defective in each of these two classes of bst mutants ( Fig . 2D ) ( 17 ) ; in the case of the p24 mutants , the strength of the GPI - AP defect mirrored the strength of the bst phenotype ( Fig . 2 , C and D , andfig . S4 , A and B ) . Two final core BSTs were YGL024w , a dubious open reading frame ( fig . S5 ) , and ERV29 , an ER export receptor for soluble cargo proteins ( 18 , 19 ) . ERV29 deletion conferred a weak bst phenotype that was potentiated by additional disruption of ERP1 ( Fig . 2C ) . Although Erv29p does not par - ticipate directly in the trafficking of GPI - APs ( 18 ) , an erv29 D mutation exacerbated the Gas1p processing defect observed in erp1 D cells ( Fig . 2D and fig . S4A ) . Because most core bst mutants shared defects in ER export of Gas1p , we considered the pos - sibility that broad depletion of nonessential car - goes could permit more efficient capture of essential proteins , enabling cell survival even when the COPII coat is compromised . However , matura - tion of the soluble vacuolar hydrolase , CPY , was normal in bst mutant strains ( Fig . 2D and fig . S4C ) , suggesting that the bst mutations do not generally enhance secretion . Furthermore , all of the known cargo adaptors were screened in our genetic analyses , yet only the p24 proteins and Erv29p arose as hits ( table S1 ) , suggesting that there is something unique about the cargo mol - ecules handled by these proteins that permits deletion of Sec13p . Both GPI - APs and p24 pro - teins are particularly abundant ( 20 ) and highly asymmetrical membrane proteins , with the bulk of their mass residing exclusively ( GPI - APs ) or predominantly ( p24s ) in the ER lumen . Local - ized concentration of such asymmetrically dis - tributed cargoes could alter the physical properties of the membrane by steric or entropic mechanisms and oppose the curvature enforced by the COPII coat by virtue of this topology ( fig . S6 ) . This model could also explain the bst phenotype of erv29 D , because Erv29p becomes asymmetric when bound to its soluble clients . The decrease in local concentration of cargoes associated with bst mutants could lower the membrane - bending energy such that the COPII coat could act in the absenceofSec13p ( fig . S7 ) . Twomajorcurvature - inducing ER membrane proteins , Rtn1p and Yop1p ( 21 ) , did not affect viability of a bst1 D sec13 D strain ( Fig . 3A ) , suggesting that global curvature of the ER membrane is unrelated to Sec13p bypass . Furthermore , deletion of the very - long - chain fatty acid elongases , Sur4p or Fen1p , reversed the viability of the bst1 D sec13 D strain but not the bst1 D sec31 - DK strain ( Fig . 3B ) , suggesting that these lipid species modulate cur - vature at the nuclear pore , where Sec13p func - tions in complex with Nup145 ( 6 ) , rather than in COPII vesicles ( 22 ) . Thus , BST genes appear to specifically influence membrane properties at the sites of vesicle formation . Our genetic data point to a role for Sec13p in generating vesicles from membranes that contain thefullcomplementofasymmetrically distributed proteins , cargoes that may confer local negative spontaneous curvature . We investigated whether Sec13p contributes rigidity to the Sec31p rods such that cage polymerization can exert sufficient Fig . 3 . Global ER curvature is unrelated to Sec13p bypass . ( A ) Reticulons , which maintain curvature of the ER , are not required for the bst phenotype because bst1 D sec13 D cells are viable when Yop1p and Rtn1p are deleted . ( B ) Likewise , long - chain fatty acid synthases Sur4p and Fen1p are not required for generation of curvature during COPII vesicle formation . Fig . 4 . A Sec31p mutant with altered flexibility sug - gests that Sec13p provides rigidity to the Sec13 / 31p complex . ( A ) Structural representation of Sec31p showing the flexible span between the b - propeller and ACE domains , including a region ( dotted line ) not visualized in the crystal structure . ( B ) Plasmids encod - ing Sec31p mutants — psec31 - D blade ( D 379 - 412 ) or psec31 - D hinge ( D 332 - 412 ) — were introduced into sec31 D and sec31 D emp24 ∆ strains as indicated and grown on 5 - FOA at 30° and 37°C . ( C ) Sec31p - D hinge was recruited to COPII - containing liposomes as de - scribed in Fig . 1D .

( F ) Maturation of Gas1p and CPY maturation was assessed as described in Fig . 2D . www . sciencemag . org SCIENCE VOL 335 16 MARCH 2012 1361 REPORTS on M a y 5 , 20 12 www . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m force on the ER membrane to overcome the membrane - bending energy of this asymmetric membrane . We deleted the flexible region that links the ACE and b - propeller domainsof Sec31p , creating an edge element that might be expected to exhibit structural rigidity conferred by direct apposition of the two domains ( Fig . 4A ) . Indeed , thecorrespondingmutant , sec31 - D hinge , supported viability independent of a bst mutation ( Fig . 4B ) . In contrast , deletion of the DIM alone , which pre - serves a short flexible domain and a disordered loop missing from the crystal structure , did not suffice for viability unless an additional bst muta - tion was present ( sec31 - D blade in Fig . 4B ) . The purifiedSec31p - D hingeproteinassembledonsyn - thetic liposomes ( Fig . 4C ) , suggesting robust func - tionality . In cells expressing only this rigidified form of Sec31p , Sec13p - GFP redistributed from large ER exit sites to a diffuse cytosolic localiza - tion with a coincident increase in nuclear enve - lope fluorescence ( Fig . 4D ) . Small residual puncta may have reflected a Sec16p - associated pool of Sec13p ( 7 ) , which is not required for viability because , unexpectedly , SEC13 could be deleted entirely when Sec31p - D hinge was expressed ( Fig . 4E ) . ER exit sites , as marked by Sec24p - GFP , were normal in sec31 - D hinge mutant cells that lacked Sec13p ( Fig . 4D ) , and secretory protein maturationinvivowasindistinguishablefromwild - type cells ( Fig . 4F ) , suggesting that ER export was fully operational in the absence of Sec13p . We tested the effect of converse mutations in Sec31p — those that might decrease rigidity of the Sec13 / 31p complex by destabilizing the b - propellerinterface — and demonstrated that one such mutant was viable only in a sec31 D emp24 D background , despite being able to assemble into a Sec13 / 31p complex ( fig . S8 ) . We thus propose that Sec13p rigidifies the COPII cage , increasing its membrane - bending capacity ; when a bst mu - tation creates a donor membrane more permis - sive to deformation , this function of Sec13p is no longer required ( fig . S7 ) . By exploiting the bst phenotype tounderstand how secretion occurs when the COPII coat is compromised , we determined that cargo sorting can impact vesicle formation . We propose that bst mutations create a locally altered membrane that lacks the full complement of asymmetrically distributed cargo proteins such that the mem - brane can be deformed into a small vesicle ab - sent the rigidifying effect of Sec13p . Indeed , a truncated form of Sec31p that lacks a flexible domain encompassing the Sec13p interaction motif supports viability in the absence of a bst mutation , suggesting that an artificially rigidified coat can exert sufficient force to bend an asym - metric cargo - richmembrane . Membrane - bending properties of coat proteins have largely been char - acterized on synthetic liposomes ( 23 – 25 ) , which fail to recapitulate important properties of cellular membranes , including the abundance and com - plexity of protein cargoes and the asymmetry that lipids and proteins can exhibit across the bilayer . Coat proteins have evolved to overcome the barrier to curvature that such constituents present , employing multiple mechanisms to en - force shape changes ( 4 ) . The structural rigidity conferred to the COPII coat by Sec13 has par - allels in other vesicle transport systems , notably the clathrin coat , where structural models predict that depletion of clathrin light chain renders the heavy - chain triskelion more flexible , yet still competent for vesicle formation ( 26 ) . The pres - ence of Sec13 within the COPII cage may also permit multiple geometries , allowing the coat to adapt to cell - or condition - specific cargo pack - aging requirements ( 27 ) . Indeed , mammalian cells depleted of Sec13 show collagen - specific traf - ficking defects ( 28 ) that may reflect the inability of a Sec13 - free coat to adequately deform the membrane around a uniquely rigid cargo . Fur - thermore , ER export of large cargoes requires alternative COPII subunits like the yeast Sec24p paralog Lst1p / Sfb2p , which facilitates traffic of the abundant oligomeric Pma1p complex ( 29 , 30 ) , or accessory factors such as human TANGO1 , which promotes trafficking of procollagen ( 31 ) . Such accessory proteins could influence mem - brane properties to either oppose the force of the COPII coat , preventing premature vesicle scission , or augment curvature conferred by the coat to ensure encapsulation of a rigid cargo . In addition to large and rigid cargoes , we propose that proteins with particularly asymmetric topologies will also influence the mechanics of vesicle formation . References and Notes 1 . E . A .

Tsien 1 , 2 * Neurotransmission depends on movements of transmitter - laden synaptic vesicles , but accurate , nanometer - scale monitoring of vesicle dynamics in presynaptic terminals has remained elusive . Here , we report three - dimensional , real - time tracking of quantum dot - loaded single synaptic vesicles with an accuracy of 20 to 30 nanometers , less than a vesicle diameter . Determination of the time , position , and mode of fusion , aided by trypan blue quenching of Qdot fluorescence , revealed that vesicles starting close to their ultimate fusion sites tended to fuse earlier than those positioned farther away . The mode of fusion depended on the prior motion of vesicles , with long - dwelling vesicles preferring kiss - and - run rather than full - collapse fusion . Kiss - and - run fusion events were concentrated near the center of the synapse , whereas full - collapse fusion events were broadly spread . N eurons communicate by releasing neuro - transmitter and thus activating postsyn - apticreceptors . Thepositionandmovement of neurotransmitter - containing vesicles are essen - tial for proper communication . However , vesicle dynamics during the period leading up to release 16 MARCH 2012 VOL 335 SCIENCE www . sciencemag . org 1362 REPORTS on M a y 5 , 20 12 www . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m
