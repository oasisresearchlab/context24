[ 1 ] Current methods for high - quality QD synthesis are gener - ally in the oil phase and require extreme conditions . [ 2 ] More - over , QDs synthesized by these methods often need further modiﬁ cation for aqueous - phase dispersion , which makes the whole process more complicated . [ 3 ] In recent years , water - soluble QD synthesis with biosystems such as Lactobacillus , E . coli , yeast cells , and earthworms , [ 4 ] has become available . Currently , yeast cells are regarded as an ideal candidate for the synthesis of water - soluble QDs , including CdSe , CdS , and Sb 2 O 3 . [ 5 ] These biosynthetic processes can be controllably achieved by utilizing cellular processes in mild conditions , and the prepared QDs have outstanding properties similar to those synthesized by traditional methods . Some related chemical reactions have been investigated for better under - standing and control of the biosynthetic processes . [ 4a , c , 5a , c ] However , so far as we know , due to the complexity of the organisms , the correlation between the outside stimulation and the response of yeast cells in biosynthesis has never been analyzed . Cell nanomechanical strength is directly linked to cell morphology , motility , and the processes of cell growth , reproduction , apoptosis , and so on . [ 6 ] Herein , the nanome - chanical properties of yeast cells in every important stage of CdSe QD biosynthesis were analyzed by means of atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) imaging and force measurements . [ 7 ] Moreover , a transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) , glucan assay , and reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) were also applied for better understanding of cell nanomechanical properties in the CdSe QD biosynthesis . Figure 1 a illustrates the preparation of yeast - cell samples in our experiments . The biosynthesis of CdSe QDs in yeast cells was realized by ‘space – time coupling’ as in our previous reports . [ 4c , 5a ] First , yeast cells ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) were cultured in yeast extract peptone dextrose ( YPD ) until the stationary phase ( sample 1 ) . Then , cells were transferred into YPD with the addition of Na 2 SeO 3 ( 5 m m ) and cultured for another 24 h ( seleniumized cells , sample 5 ) . For the acqui - sition of the as - reported cells with in situ synthesized QDs ( sample 6 ) , seleniumized cells were harvested by centrifuga - tion and cultured in CdCl 2 - containing YPD medium ( 1 m m ) for 24 h . The corresponding controls ( samples 2 and 3 ) were prepared by culturing yeast cells in common YPD for the same time as for samples 5 and 6 . Sample 4 was prepared by culturing sample 2 in YPD containing 1 m m CdCl 2 for 24 h . As shown in Figure 1 b , c , the suspensions of sample 1 – 4 were all milky white in bright ﬁ eld and only had faint blue autoﬂ uorescence under UV irradiation . Seleniumized cells ( sample 5 ) also had faint blue autoﬂ uorescence but were light red in bright ﬁ eld , which agreed well with our previous report that Se ( IV ) was reduced in this step . [ 5a ] Sample 6 ( yeast cells with in situ synthesized QDs ) turned light orange in bright ﬁ eld and showed bright yellow ﬂ uorescence under UV irra - diation . Moreover , ﬂ uorescence was clearly observed in the cytoplasm outside the cell vacuole ( Figure 1 a , inset ) , which indicates that there was ﬂ uorescent material in this area . After the materials were separated and puriﬁ ed from yeast cells , typical crystal structures of CdSe QDs were observed by using TEM ( Figure S1 , Supporting Information ) , which were in good agreement with our previous reports . [ 5a ] All the above results suggest that CdSe QDs were successfully syn - thesized in our experiments . The as - prepared yeast cells were immobilized on glass slides modiﬁ ed with poly - l - lysine and imaged with AFM in aqueous solution . Figure 2 a , b , show a mass of freshly prepared yeast cells in the stationary phase ( sample 1 ) dispersed on the glass substrates in aqueous solution . The topography of a single cell can be clearly observed in both the height and the deﬂ ec - tion images . Even daughter bud scars can be distinguished ( Figure 2 c ) . Single yeast cells can be repeatedly imaged without visible detachment . Yeast cells were quasiround and plump with DOI : 10 . 1002 / smll . 201301940 Quantum Dot Biosynthesis Q . - Y . Luo , Dr .

The cell diameters were 2 – 7 μ m and their heights were 1 – 2 μ m , which are in good agreement with previous reports . [ 8 ] In aqueous solution , yeast cells were meas - ured to be negatively charged ( zeta potential ca . −13 . 5 mV ) , which is consistent with the previous reports . [ 9 ] Therefore , in our experiments , the electrostatic attraction between the yeast cells and the positively charged poly - l - lysine modiﬁ ed glass slides were strong enough to resist the perturbation from the moving tip in contact - mode imaging . It is well known that efﬁ - cient , repeatable , and stable immobilization is the prerequisite for AFM measurements , [ 10 ] thus the immobilization of the as - prepared yeast cells on poly - l - lysine modiﬁ ed glass slides make the subsequent nanomechanical analysis feasible . Other as - prepared yeast cell samples were also immo - bilized and imaged by using the same method . As shown in Figure 2 d – h , similar to sample 1 , cells had round or quasiround shapes with diam - eters of 2 – 7 μ m . No typical difference was found in the height images ( Figure 2 d – h , insets ) . In the deﬂ ection images , the sur - faces of sample 2 – 5 were all homogeneous and smooth , while a signiﬁ cant deﬂ ec - tion contrast ( the brighter part ) could be observed near the center of the cell in the deﬂ ection image of sample 6 ( Figure 2 h ) , which indicates that the response to the pressure from the moving tips is not uni - form in all areas of the yeast cells with in situ synthesized QDs . This deﬂ ec - tion contrast could be observed on most cells in the large - scale image of sample 6 ( Figure S3 ) . To evaluate the nanomechanical strength of the as - prepared yeast cells , force – distance curves were captured and Young’s modulus ( E ) was calculated ( see Experimental Section ) . [ 8a , 11 ] Typically , after imaging one cell , the AFM tip was taken from one edge to the other edge of the cell and force – distance curves were captured every 500 nm , after which the cell was imaged again . By comparing the two images , the location of each force – distance curve can be determined ( Figure 3 a , inset ) . For each location , at least 30 force – distance curves were obtained . Force – distance curves from each location were converted to E values with the known spring constant of the cantilever ( k ) , deﬂ ection of the cantilever ( d ) , and the indentation in cells ( δ ; for more details , see Experimental Section ) . As shown in Figure 3 a , the statis - tical E values of sample 1 did not distribute homogeneously Figure 2 . AFM images of the yeast - cell samples .

KGaA , Weinheim over the cell surface . For normal yeast cells incubated for 24 h ( sample 1 ) , typically , the averaged E value reached ca . 5 MPa at the edges ( position 1 and 8 ) , while it was only ca . 1 MPa at the center ( point 5 ) . The center E value was in good agree - ment with that in previous reports . [ 8b , 11a , 12 ] It is well known that at the cell edges , the substrate provides support to the cell and induces relatively larger E values . [ 13 ] Similar tendency of the E values was also observed in ﬁ ve other yeast - cell sam - ples ( Figure S4 ) . Thus in the subsequent measurements , the centers of the cells were located so that the edge effect could be avoided . [ 13 ] E values near the center of each sample are summa - rized in Figure 3 b . For yeast cells in the stationary phase ( sample 1 ) , the E value was 1 . 14 ± 0 . 15 MPa in aqueous solu - tion , which was in good agreement with that in the previous report . [ 12 ] Generally , if yeast cells were incubated under the same conditions ( sample 1 – 3 ) , the E value rose with time . Sample 3 ( normal yeast cells in YPD ) , which was incubated for the longest ( 48 h after stationary phase ) , had a larger E value than samples 1 and 2 . For samples incubated for the same time with the addition of Na 2 SeO 3 , the seleniumized yeast cells had similar E values ( 2 . 48 ± 0 . 53 MPa for sample 5 ) to those in YPD only ( 2 . 72 ± 1 . 01 MPa for sample 2 ) , which indicates that the effect of the addition of Na 2 SeO 3 on E value was negligible in our experiments . However , the E value of sample 4 ( 1 . 30 ± 0 . 08 MPa ) was greatly decreased over that of sample 3 , simply by addition of CdCl 2 . Sample 6 had the largest E value , indicating that after the biosynthesis , the nanomechanical strength of yeast cells was signiﬁ cantly improved . Key factors that may inﬂ uence the nanomechanical strength of yeast cells include the support from both the cell wall and the internal cytoplasm . Generally , in Young’s modulus measurements of cells , the indentation should be limited to about 10 % of the cell height to prevent possible mechanical destruction of the cells . [ 8b ] The yeast - cell - wall thickness ( usually more than 100 nm ) may strongly inﬂ u - ence the measured E values . Therefore , the cell - wall thick - nesses of the prepared yeast cells were measured with TEM . As shown in Figure 3 b , compared to that of the E values , the variation tendency of cell - wall thickness was almost the same . Generally , longer incubation time resulted in larger nano - mechanical strength and thicker cell walls . It is well known that with increasing incubation time cell metabolites , such as chitosan , accumulate at the outside surface . [ 14 ] In addition , the cell buds in different areas throughout long - term incuba - tion . Aged cells might bud many times and have more bud scars than younger ones . Since scars are always stiffer than the nonbudding areas , [ 11b ] both the mechanical properties and cell - wall thickness of cells increase with longer incuba - tion times . In Figure 3 b , it can be also seen that with the same incu - bation time , the cell - wall thickness of the seleniumized yeast cells ( 204 . 1 ± 18 . 9 nm for sample 5 ) was as almost the same as that of normal cells ( 202 . 6 ± 19 . 8 nm for sample 2 ) . For the addition of CdCl 2 , the cell - wall thickness ( 205 . 6 ± 31 . 9 nm for sample 4 ) was smaller than that of cells incubated for the same time in normal YPD ( 220 . 2 ± 17 . 1 nm for sample 3 ) . This result is mainly due to the inhibition by Cd 2 + of cell - wall growth , which induced nonuniformity in cell - wall thickness .

Luo et al . 702 www . small - journal . com communications © 2013 Wiley - VCH Verlag GmbH & Co . KGaA , Weinheim Moreover , sample 6 , which had the largest E value , also had the largest cell - wall thickness ( Table S1 ) . In yeast - cell walls , 1 , 3 - β - glucan networks are generally regarded to be responsible for mechanical strength . [ 15 ] In our experiments , by measuring the ﬂ uorescence of the com - plex formed with aniline blue , the content of 1 , 3 - β - glucan was quantiﬁ ed . [ 16 ] As shown in Figure 3 c , the variation ten - dency of 1 , 3 - β - glucan content was similar to that of cell - wall thickness and E value , indicating that 1 , 3 - β - glucan is directly related to both the cell - wall thickness and the mechanical strength of yeast cells . The controllable CdSe QDs biosynthesis in living yeast cells was realized by space – time coupling . [ 5a ] The process involved the reduction of Na 2 SeO 3 and the detoxiﬁ cation of Cd 2 + by the cells . In our experiments , the simple addition of Na 2 SeO 3 had negligible effect on both the E value and the cell - wall thickness , which indicates that the reduction of Na 2 SeO 3 obviously does not affect cell mechanics . On the other hand , the addition of CdCl 2 signiﬁ cantly inﬂ uenced the glucan content , the cell - wall thickness , and the E value of yeast cells . Normally , Cd 2 + is known to be toxic to cells by increasing the reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in the cells . [ 17 ] Since ROS deplete glutathione that is necessary for enzyme function , [ 17b ] the addition of Cd 2 + inhibits cell growth . In our experiments , both the cell - wall thickness and the E value of sample 4 are smaller than those of sample 3 , which indicates that cell growth is suspended after the addition of CdCl 2 . Sample 6 had the largest glucan content and the cell - wall thickness and E value both proved that the intracellular metabolism of Na 2 SeO 3 in a yeast cell could improve the cell’s ability to detoxify CdCl 2 , with QDs being generated in yeast cells during the process . 1 , 3 - β - glucan synthase ( GS ) is the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of 1 , 3 - β - glucan . In our experiment , the GS of yeast cells in biosynthesis was measured to increase by 8 . 1 % compared with normal cells with the same incubation time . The GS contains a catalytic subunit that catalyzes the transfer of a glucose moiety from uridine diphosphate glucose ( UDP - glucose ) to the glucan chain . [ 15b ] The GSC2 gene encodes the catalytic subunit [ 18 ] and the RHO1 gene acts as the molecular switch whose guanosine - 5’ - triphosphate ( GTP ) - bound form speciﬁ cally activates the GS . [ 15b ] The expression of these two genes in yeast cells was analyzed by using RT - PCR in yeast cells with in situ synthesized QDs ( sample 6 ) and normal ones ( sample 3 ) as shown in Figure 3 d . The expression of both the GSC2 and the RHO1 was dramatically up - regu - lated after biosynthesis compared with that in normal yeast cells . In yeast cells with in situ synthesized QDs , the expres - sion of GSC2 was 12 times as much as in normal cells , while the expression of RHO1 was four times as much . The above results indicate that the CdSe QD biosynthesis in yeast cells induced the expression of GSC2 and the RHO1 , and thus further increased the GS and 1 , 3 - β - glucan content . The yeast - cell mechanical strength increased as a result . When the cell wall was removed , the integrity of yeast cells was damaged . Only faint ﬂ uorescence could be observed in the yeast cells without intact cell walls after CdSe QD biosynthesis ( Figure S5 ) . This result indicates that an intact cell wall guaranteed highly efﬁ cient CdSe QD biosynthesis in yeast cells . Furthermore , in our experiments , the E value was larger in the yeast cells with in situ synthesized QDs ( sample 6 ) distributed more uniformly on the cell com - pared with the sample incubated for the same time ( sample 3 ) . Since the cytoplasm transported CdSe QDs to the entire cell , the physical support from the widely dispersed QDs may average the E values across the cell . In summary , our work demonstrates that nanomechanical analysis of cells can be related to the internal chemical reac - tion and give hints of the cell structures . In our experiments , the nanomechanical strength of live yeast cells in CdSe QDs biosynthesis was closely connected to the support of the cell wall . The nanomechanical strength of yeast cells with in situ synthesized QDs was much larger than that of normal cells incubated for the same time . The addition of the Se precursor ( Na 2 SeO 3 ) did not obviously vary yeast - cell nanomechanical strength , while the addition of the Cd precursor ( CdCl 2 ) could signiﬁ cantly decrease it . In biosynthesis , the coexist - ence of Na 2 SeO 3 and the synthesis of CdSe QDs could elimi - nate the effect of CdCl 2 . Our results also demonstrate that 1 , 3 - β - glucan is responsible for the variation of both cell - wall thickness and the cell nanomechanical strength in QD bio - synthesis . The method proposed here provides new insight into the relationship between cell - structure variation and nanomechanical responses of live cells under stimulation . Experimental Section Materials : The strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4742 MAT α his3 - Δ 1 , leu3 - Δ 0 , lys2 - Δ 0 , ura3 - Δ 0 was used . Poly - L - lysine ( ZLI - 9005 ) was supplied by Zhongshanjinqiao ( China ) . Zymolyase was supplied by Seikagaku ( Tokyo , Japan ) . All other chemicals used were of analytical purity . Ultrapure water used in all experi - ments was puriﬁ ed with Millipore ( resistivity = 18 . 2 M Ω cm ) . Glass slides were supplied by Fisherband ( Fisher Scientiﬁ c , USA ) . Yeast cells were all ﬁ rst cultured in YPD broth ( yeast extract : 10 g L −1 , peptone : 20 g L −1 , glucose : 20 g L −1 ) until the stationary phase . As shown in Figure 1 a , sample 1 was the yeast cells in the stationary phase . Sample 5 was sample 1 coincubated with 5 m M Na 2 SeO 3 for 24 h . Sample 6 was sample 5 treated by centrifugation ( 2000 g min −1 , 3 min ) , harvesting , transporting into fresh YPD cul - ture , and mixing with CdCl 2 ( ﬁ nal concentration 1 m M ) ; it was then cultured for another 24 h . Sample 2 was the control of sample 5 ; it was sample 1 cultured in common YPD for 24 h . Samples 3 and 4 were the controls of sample 6 . Sample 3 was sample 2 treated by centrifugation ( 2000 g min −1 , 3 min ) , harvesting , transporting into fresh YPD culture , then culturing for another 24 h . Sample 4 was prepared by the same process as sample 3 but transported into CdCl 2 - containing YPD culture ( ﬁ nal concentration : 1 m M ) . All the samples were cultured at 30 ° C with 200 rpm min −1 shaking . Ultraviolet ( UV ) Observation of Yeast Cells : All samples of yeast cells were observed under a 302 - nm ultraviolet lamp ( ZF5 , JiaPeng , Shanghai ) in the darkroom . Immobilization of Yeast Cells on Glass Slides : Immobilization of yeast cells was achieved by attachment to poly - L - lysine - coated glass slides . Prior to modiﬁ cation with poly - L - lysine , the glass slides were ﬁ rst ultrasound - cleaned in ethanol three times , then immersed in alkaline solution [ NH 3 ·H 2 O : H 2 O 2 : H 2 O = 1 : 1 : 5 ( v / v ) ] small 2014 , 10 , No . 4 , 699 – 704 Nanomechanical Analysis of Yeast Cells in CdSe Quantum Dot Biosynthesis 703 www . small - journal . com © 2013 Wiley - VCH Verlag GmbH & Co . KGaA , Weinheim for 30 min and transferred into piranha solution [ H 2 O 2 : H 2 SO 4 = 3 : 7 ( v / v ) ] for 2 h at about 90 ° C to make sure they were thoroughly cleaned . After each step above , the slides were thoroughly rinsed with ultrapure water and blow - dried with pure N 2 . Poly - L - lysine solution ( 10 % , w / v , diluted with ultrapure water ) was dropped onto the glass slides and incubated until it dried . All samples of yeast cells were centrifuged ( 2000 g min −1 , 3 min ) and then trans - ported into ultrapure water . Poly - L - lysine - functionalized glass slides were covered with the cell suspension ( 20 μ L ) for 6 h at 4 ° C to allow the cells to attach to the glass slide . Unattached or weakly attached cells were removed by washing the glass surface with ultrapure water . Lastly , samples were transferred into the AFM liquid cell and covered with water immediately . AFM Imaging and Force Measurement : All AFM experiments were performed by a Nanoscope IV AFM ( Bruker AXS , Germany ) with gold - coated Si 3 N 4 cantilevers ( Microlevers , Bruker , Germany ) at room temperature . The spring constants of the cantilevers were measured by using the thermal noise method to be about 0 . 6 N m −1 . Tip radius was < 20 and half curvature of the tip was 35 ° . All AFM experiments results were obtained in water . For better location and more reliable Young’s modulus meas - urements , the AFM imaging was ﬁ rst performed in contact mode with a scan rate of ca . 0 . 5 Hz and then F – d curves were obtained at a rate of 0 . 5 μ m s −1 , with typical piezo displacements of ca . 2 μ m . Parameters were all optimized in experiments . Curves on the functionalized glass slides were also obtained as the base calculation for an accurate Young’s modulus . Force curves were recorded at different locations over a chosen area of cell surface . Young’s moduli were obtained by analysis of the contact region through the Hertz model . At least ten cells of each sample were measured . The Hertz model is one of the most widely used models to quantify the mechanical properties of biological samples . This model has some prerequisites : 1 ) the contacting area should be homogenous and isotropic ; 2 ) the target surface should be suc - cessive and smooth ; 3 ) the small - deformation elastic condi - tion should be met ; 4 ) the friction force from the contacting area can be ignored ; 5 ) neither the adhesion nor the twisting force is considered , except the contacting force . Moreover , two hypoth - eses are assumed for research involving cells : 1 ) that the cell is considered elastic without viscidity , which means a inﬁ nitely stiff probe pressing into a smooth and soft surface ; 2 ) the deformation of the cell is limited to half of its own height ( normally 10 % ) . The approach curves should be a proper shape to calculate Young’s modulus over the cell surfaces . The relation between the loading force and indentation depth is given below . F = k × d = 2 × E B × ( 1 − v 2 ) * 2 tan " ( 1 ) Here , F is the applied force that can be calculated using Hooke’s law with the known cantilever spring constant , k , and cantilever deﬂ ection , d . E is the Young’s modulus of the cells , and ν is the Poisson ' s ratio . For elastic cell surfaces , generally , 0 . 5 is a reasonable value for ν . The geometry of the AFM used is also considered . α is the half - opening angle of a conical tip , and δ is the indentation depth of the tip into the sample surface , which is equal to the difference between the cantilever deﬂ ections meas - ured on a hard surface and on a soft surface . TEM Imaging : For the characterization of CdSe QDs , yeast cells with in situ synthesized QDs were dispersed in 5 mL of lysis buffer ( 10 m M Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , SDS ) in a ratio of 1 g per 3 mL , and then disrupted with glass beads in a Mini - Bead Beater ( Biospec USA ) six times for 1 min , with 2 min breaks between each run . After removal of the unbroken cells and cell debris by centrifugation ( 16000 g , 10 min ) , the supernatant was concentrated by using an Amicon ultra - 15 100 K Centrifugal Filter device . A four - step sucrose gradient ( 3 mL 60 % , 2 mL 45 % , 2 mL 30 % , 2 mL 8 % ) was used for further centrifugation ( 134000 g , 4 h , 4 ° C ) . The sucrose was puriﬁ ed by gel electrophoresis and dialysis . For the measurement of the cell - wall thickness , all the sam - ples were prepared following the acknowledged method . Brieﬂ y , the monolayer cells were ﬁ xed by using 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 4 , and then postﬁ xed in 1 % OsO4 in veronal buffer at 4 ° C for 1 h and blocked - stained with 0 . 5 % uranyl acetate for 20 min . Specimens were dehydrated in increasing eth - anol concentrations and embedded in parafﬁ n . Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate . TEM images were taken on a Tecnai G2 20 S - TWIN transmission electron microscope at 200 kV . High - resolution TEM images were taken on a JEOL - JEM 2010EF transmission electron microscope at 200 kV . Cell Wall Removal : Seleniumized yeast cells were transported into PBS with 1 . 2 mol L −1 sorbierite and 5 g L −1 Zymolyase , and then incubated at 30 ° C with 200 rpm min −1 shaking for 12 h . The resultant yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation ( 2000 g min −1 , 3 min ) for further CdCl 2 addition . Morphological Observations : Cells were harvested by centrif - ugation ( 2000 g min −1 , 3 min ) into 1 × PBS , then viewed on an Olympus microscope ( I × 51 , 100 objective , N . A . = 1 . 35 ) . Assay of 1 , 3 - β - Glucan : The measurements were performed as in the previous report . [ 16 ] Samples were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min , washed twice , and suspended in TE buffer with the ﬁ nal OD 600 about 0 . 2 – 0 . 5 . 6 mol L −1 NaOH was added to the suspension to give a ﬁ nal concentration of 1 mol L −1 . 1 , 3 - β - glucan was solubilized by incubation in water bath at 80 ° C for 30 min , and quantiﬁ ed with aniline blue using a modiﬁ ed method : Brieﬂ y , a volume of mixed aniline blue solution ( 40 volumes of 0 . 1 % aniline blue in water , 21 volumes of 1 N HCl , and 59 volumes of 1 mol L −1 glycine / NaOH buffer , pH 9 . 5 ) was added and incubated at 50 ° C for 30 min to form 1 , 3 - β - glucan - ﬂ uorochrome complex . The unbound ﬂ uorescent dye was further decolorized at room temperature for 30 min , and the ﬂ uorescence intensity was measured by using a Fluorolog - 3 ( Horiba JobinYvon , France ) , Ex = 400 nm , Em = 502 nm . Quantitative Real - Time RT - PCR : For the measurement of gene expression on the yeast cell wall , a standard protocol real - time PCR was performed . The total RNA from yeast cells was extracted according to the procedure described previously [ 19 ] and subse - quently reversed - transcribed to cDNA using a Reverse Transcription System ( Promoega , USA ) as per the manufacturer’s protocol . PCRs were carried out in a ﬁ nal volume of 20 μ L as a mixture of cDNA and SYBR Premix Dimer Eraser ( TaKaRa , Japan ) . Thermal cycling was performed in a LightCycler ( Roche Diagnostics , USA ) . According to the manufacturer ' s recommendations , the temperature protocol was : i ) 30 s at 95 ° C for denaturation ; ii ) 40 cycles each of 30 s at 95 ° C , 30 s at 58 ° C , and 25 s at 72 ° C for PCR ; iii ) 15 s at 65 ° C for ampliﬁ cation ; iv ) 0 s at 95 ° C , 15 s at 65 ° C and 0 s at 95 ° C for melting - curve analysis ; v ) 30 s at 30 ° C for cooling . small 2014 , 10 , No . 4 , 699 – 704 Q . - Y .
