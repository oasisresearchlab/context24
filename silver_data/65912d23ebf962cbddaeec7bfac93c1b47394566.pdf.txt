We investigate whether such cognitive bias inﬂuences entrepreneurial venture performance using data on commercialization efforts for university inventions . In contrast to prior studies , our results suggest that entrepreneurial overoptimism does not appear to be the determining factor in the decision to found a ﬁrm . We do ﬁnd that entrepreneurs continue unsuccessful development efforts for longer periods of time than do established ﬁrms , which is consistent with entrepreneurial overoptimism in the development of technologies with uncertain market prospects . This latter ﬁnding is also consistent with rationality - based models of decision - making behavior , however . We ﬁnd that the economic returns associated with many of the technologies in our sample are realized after the start - up has been acquired by an established ﬁrm , suggesting that start - ups may serve as a transitional organizational form in the market for technology commercialization .

This paper was with the authors 8 months for 2 revisions . 1 . Introduction Entrepreneurial ﬁrms have long played a signiﬁcant role in the commercialization of university inventions , often pursuing product development after existing ﬁrms fail . For example , in 1945 the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) licensed rights to its Van deGraff patent to High Voltage Inc . , a start - up formed speciﬁcally to bring the MIT technology to market . High Voltage obtained its license only after the General Electric Company had earlier licensed this patent and failed to commercialize the technol - ogy ( Etzkowitz 2002 ) . More recently , Calimetrics , a start - up founded by a University of California inven - tor , was founded to commercialize an optical storage technology previously licensed by Uniphase ( Lowe 2001 ) . In the biotechnology industry , Chiron and Genentech are two notable ﬁrms established to com - mercialize inventions originating in the university lab . Recognizing the importance of entrepreneurial ﬁrms in commercializing these early - stage technolo - gies , universities have been increasingly willing to invest in newly established ventures . In a 2000 sur - vey , Feldman et al . ( 2002 ) found that 40 % of research universities surveyed held equity investments in new ﬁrms licensing their technology . These equity posi - tions have sometimes been proﬁtable for university investors . For example , the University of California received $ 1 . 9 million from its equity in software ﬁrm Inktomi ( UC Technology Transfer Annual Report 2000 ( 2001 ) ) and Carnegie Mellon University held consid - erable equity in and a board seat at search engine Lycos , both of which issued lucrative initial public offerings during the late 1990s . Despite these entrepreneurial success stories and the increasing enthusiasm for new ﬁrms as vehi - cles for bringing university technologies to market , commercializing new technologies through start - ups instead of more established ﬁrms involves important trade - offs . Start - ups often lack access to complemen - tary assets necessary to successfully bring a product to market , such as market knowledge , contacts with customers , or manufacturing capabilities ( Teece 1986 ) . Because these ﬁrms are typically founded for the sole pursuit of commercializing a single licensed technol - ogy , they may be unable to diversify risks in new technology development across multiple technologies as can established ﬁrms , contributing to high rates of failure . Start - ups also may be unable to reap the economies of scale in research and technology devel - opment enjoyed by larger ﬁrms , postponing or even preventing new product introduction ( Nelson 1959 ) . Indeed , Shane ( 2002 ) found that in those technology 173 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 143 . 1 . 30 ] on 02 M a r c h 2017 , a t 15 : 51 .

Focused Issue : Overoptimism and the Performance of Entrepreneurial Firms 174 Management Science 52 ( 2 ) , pp . 173 – 186 , ©2006 INFORMS ﬁelds where patent effectiveness was weak , inventor - founded licensees from MIT were more likely to ter - minate a license and less likely to introduce a new product based on the licensed technology than an established licensee , leading him to conclude that licensing to an inventor - founded start - up is less desir - able than licensing to an existing ﬁrm . University inventions typically represent early - stage or pre - prototype technologies with highly uncertain prospects . In a survey of 52 university tech - nology transfer ofﬁces , Jensen and Thursby ( 2001 ) found that over 75 % of inventions disclosed to the technology transfer ofﬁce represented only a “proof of concept” or a lab - scale prototype . Faced with such obstacles and risks , why would a would - be entrepreneur establish a start - up to pursue commer - cialization of a university technology ? For the faculty inventor , one reason could be that transaction costs in transferring technology to an outside ﬁrm ( such as adverse selection , moral hazard , or thin markets ) may prevent the market for technology from operat - ing smoothly ( Arora 1995 , 1996 ; Shane 2002 ) . Much of the knowledge necessary to understand the tech - nology may be tacit , making it difﬁcult , if not impos - sible , for the inventor to transfer this knowledge to the licensee , despite contracts that may be designed to support such transfer ( Arora 1995 , 1996 ) . Because tacit knowledge transfer would not be necessary for an inventor - founded start - up , the inventor may be able to realize greater monetary returns if she commercial - izes the invention herself ( Shane 2002 , Lowe 2001 ) . Overconﬁdence and other forms of cognitive bias also may be behind entrepreneurial initiative in com - mercializing university inventions . Since the inﬂu - ential studies by Kahneman and Tversky ( 1979 ) of human decision making , elements of cognitive bias have been identiﬁed in a wide variety of decision - making situations . For example , self - serving percep - tions of fairness have been shown to cause impasses in labor - management negotiations ( Babcock et al . 1996 ) and differences in defendant and plaintiff assessments of just monetary awards in property damage situations ( Babcock and Lowenstein 1997 ) . Security analysts have been found to make biased predictions of stock market performance ( De Bondt and Thaler 1990 ) , as have individual stock market investors ( Odean 1998 ) . Managers and entrepreneurs also may not be immune to cognitive bias and its negative effects . Hubris ( Roll 1986 ) and overconﬁdence ( Hayward and Hambrick 1997 , Malmendier and Tate 2004 ) by exec - utives are offered as explanations of overpayment by acquiring ﬁrms for takeover targets . Kahneman and Lovallo ( 1993 , p . 27 ) cite the substantial mismatch between entrepreneurs’ predictions of their chances of success and actual survival data of start - up ﬁrms as a “compelling example” of entrepreneurial overconﬁ - dence . Similarly , Camerer and Lovallo ( 1999 ) observe that overoptimism in market entry may be an impor - tant factor contributing to failure among new ﬁrms . In this paper , we consider whether the “second - best” outcome of licensing to start - up ﬁrms ( Shane 2002 ) may be due to entrepreneurial overoptimism . To do so , we compare the performance of start - ups with that of established ﬁrms in developing and com - mercializing university inventions . Our analysis con - siders three aspects of performance : ( 1 ) likelihood of achieving commercial sales , ( 2 ) likelihood of termi - nating a development effort , and ( 3 ) university licens - ing revenues generated by a developed invention . Despite the prevalence of overconﬁdence in a wide variety of decision - making situations , there has been little research on overoptimism in university technol - ogy commercialization . Our results suggest that , on average , entrepreneurs commercializing university technology do not appear to be overoptimistic in their decision to start a ﬁrm : Start - ups exhibit statistically equivalent performance rates to established ﬁrms in commercializing univer - sity inventions . We also ﬁnd that licenses to these start - ups generate licensing revenues at least as high as the revenues for licenses to established ﬁrms . These results hold even once we control for tech - nology ﬁeld , location , and time effects . More in line with an overoptimism bias , our second main ﬁnding is that start - ups continue unsuccessful development efforts for longer periods of time than do established ﬁrms . The rate of project termination is signiﬁcantly lower for start - ups than for established ﬁrms , and these results persist even after controlling for the project’s scientiﬁc ﬁeld of origin . While our second main ﬁnding is consistent with overoptimism bias , it is also consistent with rationality . Further analy - sis calls into question whether entrepreneurs may be overoptimistic in continuing to develop products with possibly limited chances for future success . In contrast to earlier studies ( e . g . , Shane 2002 ) , we ﬁnd little evidence that licensing to start - ups repre - sents a “second - best” solution . As discussed in § 5 , part of this divergent ﬁnding may be driven by the intermediary role played by start - ups in the process of commercializing these early stage technologies . While the university inventions were initially licensed to start - ups , the economic returns associated with many of the technologies in our sample were realized after the start - up had been acquired by an established ﬁrm . We discuss this ﬁnding , alternative explanations , and implications for future research in § 5 . In the next section , we brieﬂy review recent studies of university technology licensing to entrepreneurial ﬁrms and the literature on managerial cognitive bias , and develop our hypotheses .

We discuss the implications of our ﬁndings and conclude the paper in § 5 . 2 . Hypothesis Development In ambiguous environments , individuals are more likely to be overoptimistic ( Camerer and Lovallo 1999 ) . For example , in a study of the scientiﬁc and commercial development of three technologies championed by university researchers ( the artiﬁcial heart , cochlear implants , and the FK 506 immuno - suppressive drug ) , Garud and Ahlstrom ( 1997 ) found that developers of these technologies overestimated patient beneﬁts and underestimated the time and cost necessary to develop the technology and gain FDA approval . Researchers considered each of these tech - nologies to be unique , leading them to employ limited evaluation criteria compared to outside reviewers who compared the new technology to similar medi - cal technologies developed earlier . The reviewers also considered a broader range of factors that could delay commercialization but were largely ignored by the researchers , such as related technological issues , pro - duction problems , and ethical and quality of life issues . Similarly , Simon and Houghton ( 2003 ) found that managers introducing “pioneering” products ( i . e . , products entering new and uncertain markets ) exhibited signiﬁcantly greater overconﬁdence than managers introducing products embodying incremen - tal innovations . Overconﬁdence has also been demonstrated in experiments on decision making regarding market entry . Camerer and Lovallo ( 1999 ) found evidence of excess entry in experiments where participants were ranked according to skill compared to entry in control experiments where participants were given a randomly assigned skill level . Moreover , even though participants estimated accurately the number of entrants and realized that the expected value of entering was negative , excess entry still occurred , con - sistent with overestimation by individuals on their own prospects for success ( de Meza and Southey 1996 , Arabsheibani et al . 2000 ) . Kahneman and Lovallo ( 1993 ) conclude that such conﬁdence can result from approaching problems or new initiatives from a self - centered and limited per - spective , leading to “bold forecasting . ” They argue that managers frequently adopt an “inside view , ” constructing detailed plans or scenarios to achieve the desired outcome . Treating the problem in iso - lation and viewing risks as challenges to be over - come through knowledge and experience can lead to overoptimism . In contrast , an “outside view” taken by the third - party reviewers does not focus on unique project plans and details to assess a project’s prospects . This view ignores detailed projections and instead compares a particular project to a similar class of completed projects to estimate the probability of success , likely producing a more realistic projection of the eventual outcome . 1 Other studies suggest that this cognitive bias may be more pronounced among entrepreneurs than man - agers of established ﬁrms . For example , Bercovitz et al . ( 1997 ) suggest that entrepreneurial bias and managerial bias operate in distinctive ways . Whereas entrepreneurs are concerned with early - stage tech - nologies and their prospects along emerging tech - nological trajectories , managers at established ﬁrms compare new innovations to their existing products and technologies . Overconﬁdence by entrepreneurs can therefore lead to greater difﬁculty than expected in developing an innovation along the new technolog - ical trajectory . In contrast , overoptimism by managers at existing ﬁrms can lead to overestimating the ability of existing resources to develop incremental innova - tions that can compete with radical innovations . Busenitz and Barney ( 1997 ) also explore differences in cognitive bias between entrepreneurs and man - agers in existing ﬁrms . They argue that managers and entrepreneurs employ different decision - making processes to deal with risk and uncertainty . Existing ﬁrms are more likely to have established decision - making “routines , ” which reduce complexity facing managers ( Nelson and Winter 1982 ) . Moreover , man - agers at existing ﬁrms often have greater access to historical trends and data than do entrepreneurs on which to base their analyses . In contrast , start - up ﬁrms typically have not developed detailed policies governing decision making , causing entrepreneurs to be more likely to rely on simplifying biases and heuristics . Entrepreneurs developing technolo - gies in emerging technological trajectories also must often act quickly with limited information on tech - nical feasibility and market conditions to convince ﬁnanciers , employees , and other stakeholders of the start - up opportunity’s prospects . This further encour - ages entrepreneurs to rely on simplifying heuristics to speed decision making . Busenitz and Barney ( 1997 ) therefore hypothesize that entrepreneurs will express greater overconﬁdence than managers . To empiri - cally test this hypothesis , they surveyed 573 new ﬁrm founders and existing ﬁrm managers and found 1 Kahneman and Lovallo ( 1993 ) point out additional factors that may generate overoptimism at an organizational level . For exam - ple , forecasts and plans may be generated by those with a vested interest in the project’s acceptance . When projects compete with others for acceptance , there may be incentives to overstate calcula - tions and estimates . Projects with the most overoptimistic estimates may be the most likely to be accepted . Pessimistic views may be suppressed during the acceptance process , leading to a lack of crit - ical evaluation .

Focused Issue : Overoptimism and the Performance of Entrepreneurial Firms 176 Management Science 52 ( 2 ) , pp . 173 – 186 , ©2006 INFORMS that entrepreneurs demonstrated signiﬁcantly greater overconﬁdence in their survey responses than did managers of existing ﬁrms . Comparing perceptions of ﬁnancial risk between entrepreneurs and bankers , Sarasvathy et al . ( 1998 ) found that entrepreneurs tend to consider risk to be exogenous while concentrating on ways to con - trol outcomes . In experiments in which participants were presented with scenarios with varying levels and distributions of ﬁnancial returns , entrepreneurs “seemed to select the project with the best worst - case scenario (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) (cid:1) They also expressed conﬁdence that they could make the reality better than the worst - case probability calculated ex ante” ( pp . 212 – 213 ) . These studies suggest that overoptimistic percep - tions of success are more pronounced among start - up founders than managers of established ﬁrms . As a result , start - up ﬁrms may experience a lower inci - dence of successful market entry than established ﬁrms . This leads to our ﬁrst hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 . Entrepreneurial start - ups will be less likely to successfully commercialize inventions than estab - lished ﬁrms . Entrepreneurial overconﬁdence may continue after a new venture has been launched ( Cooper et al . 1988 , McCarthy et al . 1993 ) . Cooper et al . surveyed 2 , 994 entrepreneurs heading newly founded ventures about their outlook for success . Entrepreneurs were asked ( a ) “What are the odds of your business succeeding ? ” and ( b ) “What are the odds of any business like yours succeeding ? ” The authors found that entrepreneurs often perceived the odds of their own venture’s suc - cess to greatly exceed their own estimate of the chances of success for similar ventures . These ﬁnd - ings suggest that founders of recently established ﬁrms often perceived the prospects for their own entrepreneurial ventures to be higher than was war - ranted by a more objective assessment or by compar - ison with historic rates of new venture success . Shane and Stuart ( 2002 ) highlight that many univer - sity entrepreneurs rely heavily on advisors for ﬁnanc - ing , market assessments , product development , and other commercialization inputs after the start - up has been founded . Yet counsel from outside advisors often may do little to temper entrepreneurial overoptimism . For example , Suen ( 2004 ) demonstrates through a Bayesian updating process that preference by biased decision makers for advisors who share the same pref - erences and beliefs perpetuates ( and even increases ) such bias . Moreover , due to the difﬁculty in eval - uating and transmitting specialized information to the decision maker , specialists often must summa - rize this information . Suen shows that if such “coarse information” is communicated by a neutral advi - sor , entrepreneurial use of simplifying heuristics will likely cause this information to be employed in a self - serving way . These studies suggest that entrepreneurial overcon - ﬁdence is unlikely to diminish once the ﬁrm has been founded , leading to our second hypothesis : Hypothesis 2 . Start - ups will be less likely to terminate development efforts than established ﬁrms . Biased entrepreneurs may not only be overopti - mistic relative to established ﬁrm managers regarding the length of time necessary to produce a successful market introduction , they also may overestimate the expected level of returns . We therefore expect the real - ized economic returns to an invention to be lower at the margin for inventions licensed to start - ups relative to inventions licensed to established ﬁrms : Hypothesis 3 . The level of returns to inventions licensed by start - ups will be lower than the level of returns to inventions licensed by established ﬁrms . 3 . Data and Methodology 3 . 1 . Sample Construction We now turn to the empirical tests of our three hypotheses . We examine 734 inventions disclosed to the University of California ( UC ) from 1981 to 1999 and licensed exclusively to a ﬁrm . UC is one of the largest licensors of university technologies in the United States ( AUTM Licensing Survey : FY 2002 ( 2003 ) ) . In 70 cases ( 9 . 5 % of the sample ) inventions are licensed at different times by different ﬁrms . For example , Firm B may license invention i after Firm A terminated a prior license of the same invention . Our unit of analysis is , therefore , a “license - invention pair . ” 2 We deﬁne a start - up as a ﬁrm founded one year prior to or subsequent to the execution date of a license to commercialize a technology within our sam - ple . We identiﬁed start - ups through phone contacts and interviews of employees at licensee ﬁrms and the university Ofﬁce of Technology Transfer ( OTT ) . This effort was supplemented by secondary sources to ver - ify the accuracy of interviews . More than 75 % of the inventions in this sample licensed by start - ups also 2 One concern is that a start - up ﬁrm may beneﬁt from more favor - able licensing terms than an established ﬁrm , making it less costly for the start - up to hold a license ( particularly if an established ﬁrm has earlier reviewed and rejected the licensed technology ) . Unfortunately , we are not able to observe the contractual terms for the technologies licensed in our sample . We analyze contrac - tual provisions reported by Elfenbein ( 2004 ) for licensed Harvard University inventions , however , and report our analysis in the online appendix to this paper ( see http : / / mansci . pubs . informs . org / ecompanion . html ) . We ﬁnd little evidence that small ﬁrms receive more favorable terms than large ﬁrms when licensing university technologies included in his study .

Thirty - six percent of the inventions in our sample were licensed by start - up ﬁrms , with established ﬁrms licensing the remain - der . Table 1 reports the distribution of inventions by whether the licensee is an established ﬁrm or a start - up . 3 Firms often license an invention from UC before the invention has been patented , anticipating that a patent will subsequently be granted . In some cases , these licensees terminate the license prior to patent issuance . Sampling only on patented inven - tions , therefore , would overstate the rate of successful commercialization because these terminated licenses would not enter the sample . Moreover , established ﬁrms licensing inventions in our sample are more likely than start - ups to terminate a license prior to patent issue , thus biasing results in favor of estab - lished ﬁrms . Using the patent as the unit of anal - ysis also may introduce “double - counting” because many inventions are associated with more than one U . S . patent . Biomedical inventions in particular can be associated with multiple patents . The number of patents per invention in our sample ranged from 0 to 16 with a mean of 1 . 83 patents . Of the 18 inven - tions generating 6 or more patents , all of them were in biomedical ﬁelds . To mitigate these selection biases , our sample includes both patented and unpatented inventions ( although in two regression models we examine the subsample of patented inventions ) . 4 3 The distribution of established ﬁrm and start - up licensees by the nine University of California campuses is reported in the online appendix . 4 Sampling only on patented inventions may introduce additional biases . Technology areas or industries in which patents are less effective for technology transfer , product development , or com - mercialization may be underrepresented . Prior research on univer - sity licensing has shown that licenses tend to be concentrated in areas where patents are the best means of protecting the returns to innovation , namely , biomedical technologies ( Mowery et al . 2001 , These data allow us to identify the relative perfor - mance of start - ups and established ﬁrms commercial - izing similar inventions and observe the development and commercialization of licensed inventions . Con - tractual obligations include payment of minimum royalties and submission of periodic progress reports demonstrating active commercialization efforts . Fail - ure to comply with these provisions ultimately results in license termination by the university . More com - monly , we observe failed efforts when a licensee ter - minates the agreement after deciding not to pursue the technology further . 3 . 2 . Measurements of Project Survival As discussed above , a license represents an effort by a ﬁrm to develop and ultimately commercialize the licensed invention . At the end of our observation period , each license has one of three mutually exclu - sive outcomes : ( 1 ) “Commercialized” ( licensed with commercial sales ) , 188 cases ( 26 % of sample ) . ( 2 ) “Terminated” ( licensed but contract was subse - quently cancelled or ended prior to sales ) , 290 cases ( 40 % of sample ) . ( 3 ) “Censored” ( licensed but no commercial sales nor license termination ) , 256 cases ( 35 % of sample ) . We characterize inventions within outcome ( 1 ) as those for which the ﬁrm has paid royalties to the university based on achieving product sales . Out - come ( 2 ) includes inventions for which the license was cancelled , thus signalling that the licensee has dis - continued development and commercialization of the technology . Outcome ( 3 ) observations reﬂect active ( nonterminated ) licenses that have not reported com - mercial sales by the time the end of the sample period was reached in December 2002 , and therefore are censored . UC has historically followed a practice of initiat - ing a patent ﬁling only after potential licensees have demonstrated commercial interest . As a result , the patent ﬁling date most closely reﬂects the commence - ment of the commercialization process . Although not every invention is associated with an issued patent ( because a license may be terminated prior to the patent issue date ) , each licensed invention is associ - ated with a patent application ( or an approval to ﬁle a patent ) . We use the patent application or approval to ﬁle date to commence each spell in our duration models . 3 . 3 . Measurement of Economic Returns Because many ﬁrms in the sample are not pub - lic and do not report product - line sales or costs Shane 2004 ) . In our sample , 16 % of the licensed inventions dis - closed between 1980 and 1997 were unpatented within ﬁve years . D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 143 . 1 . 30 ] on 02 M a r c h 2017 , a t 15 : 51 . F o r p e r s o n a l u s e on l y , a ll r i gh t s r e s e r v e d . Focused Issue : Overoptimism and the Performance of Entrepreneurial Firms 178 Management Science 52 ( 2 ) , pp . 173 – 186 , ©2006 INFORMS related to these sales , we are unable to observe eco - nomic returns for these licensees directly . We therefore proxy for economic returns by the royalty payments received by the university as speciﬁed in the licens - ing agreement . University licensing contracts typi - cally specify a royalty based on a percentage of sales ( Jensen and Thursby 2001 ) . License revenues have previously been used to estimate the private value of university inventions ( Sampat and Ziedonis 2004 ) . 5 A challenging aspect to coding royalty data is to correctly categorize licensed inventions that received minimum royalties . Most contracts specify that the licensee pay the minimum of either a ﬁxed dollar amount ( minimum royalty ) or a percentage of total sales ( earned royalty ) . If sales are below a speciﬁed level but above zero , commercialization has occurred and the licensee pays the minimum amount . If total dollar sales are zero , the licensee pays the same mini - mum royalty , but the invention has yet to be commer - cialized . In the latter case , we assume that the ﬁrm anticipates future sales because it had not canceled or renegotiated the license . Of the inventions in our sample , 17 . 5 % generated a minimum royalty but no additional earned royalty . We code royalty payments under the following decision rules : ( 1 ) licensed inven - tions for which a minimum royalty was paid but the license was subsequently terminated are coded as ter - minated on the date of termination ( in this instance we assume that the minimum royalty does not rep - resent actual sales , but signiﬁes an effort to continue development ) , and ( 2 ) inventions generating a min - imum royalty and a subsequent earned royalty are coded as commercialized on the earliest date of min - imum royalty . We assume that the latter inventions were commercialized , but the initial sales were below the level speciﬁed for the minimum royalty payment . 6 5 A sales - based royalty measure would overstate proﬁt for ﬁrms or industries that have considerable development costs relative to revenue . To the extent that university licenses to such industries are more likely to be executed to large ﬁrms because start - ups are less likely to have access to the considerable necessary capital , such a bias would work against a ﬁnding that start - up ﬁrms perform as well as established ﬁrms . 6 The integrity of our data relies on the timeliness and accuracy of licensees reporting sales and making royalty payments . Unfortu - nately , we are not able to observe instances where the licensee ter - minates an agreement and discontinues payments to the university but continues development and commercialization activity . Shane ( 2002 ) points out that established ﬁrms may license an invention to learn about the technology or obtain related knowledge , but sub - sequently terminate the license without intent to commercialize . The likelihood of such behavior should be low because licensing is often a repeated game among inventors , the university , and out - side ﬁrms . Continued commercialization after license termination invites legal action if discovered and would preclude future licens - ing opportunities with the university . In any case , should this bias be present it would be limited to the inﬂuence that active commer - cial efforts have toward license termination . 4 . Analysis 4 . 1 . Nonparametric Survival Analysis We ﬁrst examine the hazards of commercialized and terminated inventions using Kaplan and Meier’s ( 1958 ) nonparametric product limit estimation . The Kaplan - Meier method provides a descriptive view of the overall survival functions , allowing us to unconditionally compare start - up and established ﬁrm licensees over time ( thus serving as a summary statistic ) . We calculate the probability of occurrence of an event ( e . g . , commercialization ) on a given day based on the number of events occurring , E , and the num - ber of observations at risk , R , at time t l . The Kaplan - Meier procedure generates a step - function estimate of daily survival and is particularly useful for these data because more than one - third of the observations are censored . This estimator , (cid:3) H(cid:8)t(cid:9) , is expressed as 7 (cid:3) H(cid:8)t(cid:9) = (cid:10) l (cid:1) t l < t (cid:1) 1 − E l R l (cid:2) (cid:1) ( 4 . 1 ) Our sample frame begins with licenses executed in 1981 ( which includes inventions disclosed in 1980 ) and ends in December 2002 . The maximum sur - vival time of an invention is 7 , 585 days ( 20 years , 9 months ) . An observation is removed from the at - risk pool due to the occurrence of another event ( i . e . , termi - nation ) or censoring . For example , in the estimation of the hazard of commercialization , inventions that were terminated are coded as censored at 7 , 585 days . The intuition behind this coding scheme is as follows : Our analysis estimates the probability that an inven - tion i will be successfully commercialized by ﬁrm j in time t . A termination is an event that signiﬁes inven - tion i will never be commercialized by ﬁrm j during any period . By keeping these terminated observations in the risk set throughout the process , we more pre - cisely estimate the overall probability of commercial - ization . The alternative scheme , coding terminated licenses as censored on the date of termination , would understate the pool of inventions that could have oth - erwise been commercialized , biasing the estimation upward . 8 ( The hazard of termination model employs a similar methodology , with observations removed 7 For constructing conﬁdence intervals in the analysis , stan - dard errors of the survival function are calculated by applying Greenwood’s method ( Blossfeld and Rohwer 1995 ) : SE(cid:8) (cid:3) H(cid:8)t(cid:9)(cid:9) = (cid:3) H(cid:8)t(cid:9) (cid:3) (cid:4) l (cid:1) tl < t E l R l (cid:8)R l − E l (cid:9) (cid:5) (cid:1) 8 An additional technical consideration in the hazard of termina - tion models is the treatment of inventions for which a minimum royalty was paid , but no other information on ﬁrst sale or license termination exists . As discussed earlier , we code these inventions as commercialized on the date of minimum royalty payment in the D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 143 . 1 . 30 ] on 02 M a r c h 2017 , a t 15 : 51 .

In this analysis , we estimate the likelihood that an invention exits the sample due to reaching a ﬁrst commercial sale among those inventions at risk to have a commercial sale . The survival rate for commercialization for start - up ﬁrms is below the cor - responding rate for established ﬁrms throughout vir - tually the entire time series , indicating that inventions licensed by start - ups are more likely to achieve a ﬁrst sale ( whereby they exit the sample ) than inventions licensed by established ﬁrms . Based on tests that the two hazard functions are equal at time t ( Tarone and Ware 1977 ) , we can reject that the survival functions for commercialization of technologies for start - ups and established ﬁrm licensees are identical (cid:8)P > (cid:16) 2 = 0 (cid:1) 013 (cid:9) . 9 Figure 2 plots the corresponding rates for license termination . We estimate the likelihood that a ﬁrm exits the sample due to terminating a license . The sur - vival rate for licenses to start - up ﬁrms exceeds the rate for licenses to established ﬁrms throughout the period , indicating that start - up ﬁrms are less likely to terminate a license than are established ﬁrm licensees at any time t . The Tarone - Ware test statistic indicates that these survival functions are signiﬁcantly different (cid:8)P > (cid:16) 2 = 0 (cid:1) 018 (cid:9) . The Kaplan - Meier product limit estimation shows that for our sample , at any time t , start - ups are more likely to achieve a ﬁrst sale for a licensed invention hazard of commercialization analysis . In the hazard of termination models , however , we consider observations with only minimum royalties reported as censored on the last date of the sample frame , December 31 , 2002 , rather than at 7 , 585 days because we have no information for these observations beyond that date . 9 We found similar results when employing different weighting of events over time using the log - rank and Wilcoxon statistics ( not reported ) .

We have not yet controlled for factors that may inﬂuence these survival functions , but these pre - liminary estimates suggest that , contrary to Hypoth - esis 1 , start - up ﬁrms may be at least as effective in commercializing technologies arising from university research as established ﬁrms . We explore this possi - bility further in the next section . 4 . 2 . Parametric Survival Analysis The Kaplan - Meier estimation , while informative , does not allow us to examine some of the factors that may account for the differences in commercialization out - comes between start - ups and established ﬁrms . In this section , we undertake a parametric analysis that con - trols for time , location , and technology effects that may underpin the above ﬁndings . We specify a survival estimation with a Gompertz distribution to capture the effects of time dependence in our models . The estimation is based on the follow - ing hazard function for time t ( Blossfeld and Rohwer 1995 ) : H(cid:8)t (cid:17) (cid:9) = e X(cid:20) + (cid:21)t (cid:17) . (cid:21) is an estimate of the overall hazard function over time based on the data . In each of our regressions (cid:21) is positive , reﬂecting that hazard rates are monotonically increasing with time . The vector X consists of our primary vari - able of interest , START - UP , plus control variables . START - UP = 1 if the licensee is a start - up and 0 oth - erwise . Hypothesis 1 predicts that start - ups are less likely to achieve commercial success ; in other words , that the coefﬁcient for START - UP in the commercial - ization model will be less than one . Hypothesis 2 predicts that start - ups are less likely to terminate a license , or the coefﬁcient for START - UP in the termi - nation model will be less than one . We condition these analyses on three classes of con - trol variables . First , we include dummies for the year of invention disclosure to capture time - speciﬁc effects D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 143 . 1 . 30 ] on 02 M a r c h 2017 , a t 15 : 51 .

We recognize inventions made by multiple inventors at different campuses by including a dummy variable for each inventor’s campus . We also control for technology ﬁeld effects . Previ - ous studies of university start - ups have controlled for technology ﬁeld by aggregating U . S . patent classiﬁca - tions into ﬁve broad areas ( Shane 2002 ) or by using international patent classes ( Lowe 2002 ) . Because our sample includes inventions for which patents have not been issued , we are unable to use such patent - based controls . We therefore use each inventor’s primary academic department appointment as our control . 11 Table 2 reports the results of regressions for the competing risks of commercialization and termination of inventions licensed by start - ups and established ﬁrms . Coefﬁcients with hazard rates are displayed in brackets and z - statistics are displayed in parentheses . Models 1a and 1b include only a dummy variable for start - ups as a covariate . Model 1a reports a hazard rate for commercialization greater than one ( 1 . 40 ) at a 5 % level of signiﬁcance . Similarly , Model 1b reports that the hazard rate for termination is signiﬁcantly less than unity ( 0 . 70 ) , indicating that start - up ﬁrms are less likely to terminate a license than are established 10 Licensing to start - up ﬁrms became more prevalent at U . S . uni - versities , including UC , during the 1990s ( AUTM Licensing Survey : FY 2002 ( 2003 ) ) . If much of the start - up licensing activity occurred at the end of our sample period , there could be a concern that most start - up observations would be right censored and that our results were based on little information . However , the earliest start - up license in our sample period was executed in 1984 . Moreover , by 1992 , at least a third of all licenses executed each year were to start - up ﬁrms . Table 1 reports that less than half of all start - up observations are censored by the end of 2002 . 11 The number of forward citations is a commonly used measure of a patent’s “quality . ” We do not control for invention “quality” using citations - based measures , however , because forward citations may be endogenous to successful commercialization of the underly - ing technology . Commercialized inventions may receive more cita - tions merely by the fact that others in the ﬁeld are more aware of the commercialized technology than they would be if the tech - nology did not reach the market , a “publicity effect” ( Lanjouw and Schankerman 1997 ) . Moreover , for successfully commercialized inventions , the licensee may be more likely to generate follow - on patents that would cite the licensed patent than for those that are not commercialized . For our sample , therefore , being licensed is a better indicator of ex ante quality of an invention , while for - ward citations better predict ex post development and commercial success . Consistent with a “publicity effect” for commercialized inven - tions in our sample , the median number of citations to commercial - ized patents , conditional on being licensed , is signiﬁcantly greater than the median number of citations to terminated patents , even when citations made by the licensee are excluded . This result is posted in the online appendix .

These base models are equivalent to our earlier unconditional Kaplan - Meier analyses . In Model 2a , controlling for inventor campus and department , the difference in hazard rates for com - mercialization by start - ups and established ﬁrms becomes nonsigniﬁcant ( 1 . 13 ) . This result does not support Hypothesis 1 , that start - ups exhibit a lower likelihood of initial success than do established ﬁrms . Start - ups and established ﬁrms are equally likely to commercialize inventions generated by the same uni - versity department . 12 12 This result is consistent with earlier ﬁndings that technology ﬁeld differences partially explain the occurrence of start - up foundation . Shane ( 2002 ) and Lowe ( 2002 ) found that start - ups are more likely D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 143 . 1 . 30 ] on 02 M a r c h 2017 , a t 15 : 51 .

Focused Issue : Overoptimism and the Performance of Entrepreneurial Firms Management Science 52 ( 2 ) , pp . 173 – 186 , ©2006 INFORMS 181 In Model 2b , we examine the likelihood of ter - mination using the same control variables as in Model 2a . The hazard rate for termination by start - ups remains below that of established ﬁrms ( signiﬁcant at the 1 % level ) , supporting Hypothe - sis 2 that entrepreneurs will hold projects longer than will established licensees . This suggests that entrepreneurial overconﬁdence may be manifested as a conﬁrmation bias ( Wason 1968 ) and is con - sistent with the Cooper et al . ( 1988 ) ﬁndings that entrepreneurs often remain overconﬁdent after the venture has been founded . 13 An alternative explanation for the difference between start - ups and established ﬁrms in the time they take to terminate licenses is that start - ups are more likely to pursue technology commercializa - tion in ﬁelds that are closely related to scientiﬁc or “basic research” ( Shane 2002 , Lowe 2002 ) and that inventions in these areas require longer time for development . 14 To explore this possibility , we control for the scientiﬁc nature of inventions using the SCIENCE variable proposed by Trajtenberg et al . ( 1997 ) . SCIENCE measures the level of scientiﬁc or basic research underlying a patented invention by cal - culating the proportion of all patent citations that are to journal articles . The greater the fraction of all cita - tions made to journal articles , the more heavily the patent is considered to be based on basic research . We can only examine the effect of SCIENCE on the 351 patented and licensed inventions in our sample . Models 3 and 4 in Table 3 test whether the scientiﬁc characteristic of inventions accounts for the likelihood of termination among start - ups . Model 3 is analogous to Model 2a and includes only the START - UP dummy variable and SCIENCE . Model 4 includes the full set of control variables and is analogous to Model 2b . Including SCIENCE does not substantively alter our estimates of the likelihood to terminate development efforts for this subsample . The hazard rate is slightly in technology ﬁelds where technical knowledge underlying the invention is more tacit . Lowe ( 2002 ) found that university start - ups tend to license inventions that result from research that is oriented towards basic science . 13 In a study of French entrepreneurs , Landier and Thesmar ( 2003 ) found that entrepreneurs developing their own ideas were sig - niﬁcantly more likely to be overoptimistic regarding their ven - tures’ likelihood of success than entrepreneurs that took over or inherited existing ﬁrms . To test whether inventor - founded ﬁrms performed differently than non - inventor - founded ﬁrms in our sample , we conducted the commercialization and termination anal - yses reported in Models 2a and 2b of Table 2 considering only inventor - founded ﬁrms . We found no qualitative difference from the reported ﬁndings . 14 On the other hand , overconﬁdence may be most pronounced in basic research because criteria for success are less well deﬁned , leading to optimism promoted by ambiguity ( Camerer and Lovallo 1999 ) .

Perseverance by start - ups in developing univer - sity inventions is not explained by technology area , geographic factors , or the scientiﬁc nature of the invention . Although not conclusive , this result is consistent with the view that entrepreneurs are overoptimistic about their chances for success as time proceeds and commercialization has yet to be reached . The result is also consistent with rational explanations for entrepreneurial persistence , a point we return to in § 5 . 4 . 3 . Licensing Revenues Our third analysis examines whether inventions com - mercialized by start - ups generate greater or lesser rev - enues than do those commercialized by established licensees . We consider only those technologies that are commercialized , excluding terminated and censored observations . Recall that Hypothesis 3 predicts that average returns generated by inventions developed by entrepreneurial ﬁrms should be lower than inven - tions developed by established ﬁrms . Because the distribution of royalties is truncated on the left at zero , following Shane ( 2002 ) we employ a 15 Limiting the sample to patented inventions introduces bias to our analysis by disproportionately removing licenses terminated by established ﬁrms rather than start - ups . This decreases the higher termination rate more among established ﬁrms to a rate closer to the start - up termination rate . However , the patent bias works against our ﬁndings in Models 3 and 4 .

We use the natural log of payments to the university as our dependent variable to nor - malize this distribution . Results are reported in Table 4 . Model 5 includes only the START - UP dummy variable . Model 6 incor - porates the effect of time and technology area ( inventor’s department ) , and Model 7 includes the inventor’s campus . We ﬁnd that in the base model ( Model 4 ) licenses to start - ups generate greater earnings than do inven - tions licensed to established ﬁrms , but these results are weakly signiﬁcant ( at the 10 % level ) . The coefﬁ - cient for START - UP is 1 . 04 in Model 7 and is signif - icantly different from zero at the 1 % level . Based on licensing revenue , these results suggest that start - ups outperform established ﬁrms , refuting Hypothesis 3 . 16 Our sample and analysis differs from Shane ( 2002 ) , however , because he examined returns only to established ﬁrm licensees and we compare royalties generated by both start - ups and established ﬁrms . 5 . Discussion In this paper , we explore commercialization outcomes of university technologies licensed by start - up ﬁrms based on the time to ﬁrst sale , time to license ter - mination , and level of license revenues . Utilizing a novel data set of almost two decades of licensing activity at the University of California , we compare the relative performance of start - ups and established ﬁrms in commercializing inventions discovered in the same university departments . We ﬁnd little difference between start - ups and established ﬁrms in the time it takes to develop and introduce to the market a prod - uct based on a licensed invention . We also ﬁnd that start - ups generate greater levels of licensing revenues for similar technologies than do established ﬁrms . These ﬁndings are particularly interesting because vulnerability to random environmental shocks due to early age and small size , the liability of newness ( Stinchcombe 1965 ) , or difﬁculty accessing comple - mentary assets often make start - ups prone to failure . Against a backdrop of such threats , a ﬁnding that start - ups meet and even surpass established ﬁrms in these dimensions of ﬁrm performance is inconsistent with a hypothesis that university entrepreneurs over - value commercialization opportunities prior to found - ing a ﬁrm . We do , however , ﬁnd some support for an ex post version of the overoptimism hypothesis : Relative to established ﬁrms , entrepreneurs appear to hold on longer to technologies that do not achieve commer - cial success—entrepreneurs may be “in denial” about their diminishing prospects for these inventions . While suggestive , this evidence is not sufﬁcient for us to conclude that entrepreneurs are overoptimistic in the pursuit of these technologies . For example , as long as the marginal expected beneﬁt of contin - uing development is greater than the marginal cost , it would be rational to continue development , even for technologies that eventually fail . Moreover , the expected beneﬁt may exceed expected cost at the margin regardless of whether the initial forecasts by the decision maker are overoptimistic ( Camerer and Weber 1999 ) . Programs favoring entrepreneurs such as public funding programs for start - ups ( Lerner 1999 ) , funding of university ventures by government agencies ( Lowe 2001 ) , or equity arrangements by uni - versities ( Feldman et al . 2002 ) may allow university start - ups to enjoy lower costs than existing ﬁrms in licensing and continuing development . That start - ups do achieve commercialization at a pace and level of existing ﬁrms overall suggests that it may make sense for entrepreneurs to continue development , even for those technologies that ultimately fail . On the other hand , established ﬁrms may have greater opportuni - ties to use development resources than start - ups and D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 143 . 1 . 30 ] on 02 M a r c h 2017 , a t 15 : 51 .

Focused Issue : Overoptimism and the Performance of Entrepreneurial Firms Management Science 52 ( 2 ) , pp . 173 – 186 , ©2006 INFORMS 183 thus impose a higher threshold for continuing devel - opment projects . Established ﬁrms may also be able to employ resources towards development at a greater rate than can start - ups , enabling them to obtain information on the viability of the licensed technology more quickly . This may also explain the ﬁnding that established ﬁrms terminate licenses more quickly than do start - ups for technologies that eventually fail to reach the market . Case studies of start - up commercialization of university technologies by Lowe ( 2001 ) , however , sug - gest that start - ups may invest more heavily in the early stages of technology development than estab - lished ﬁrms because they are under greater pressure to produce initial results such as prototypes , test data , or proof of concept to attract investment capital or research funding . Unfortunately , we are unable to observe the devel - opment costs and beneﬁts by licensees that would allow us to control for these factors . To explore this issue further with data that we can observe , we con - structed 10 - year “commercialization histories” of the 43 inventor - founded start - ups in the sample . Table 5 reports all inventions between 1986 and 1995 licensed to inventor - founded start - ups and includes the start - ups’ operating status as of June 2002 ( operating inde - pendently , defunct , or acquired by an established ﬁrm ) . Virtually all inventor - founded start - ups that com - mercialized an invention were acquired , and all but two of these ﬁrms were acquired prior to commer - cialization . Most unacquired ﬁrms remain in product development with no signiﬁcant sales . Note that the greatest return to UC among the independent start - ups was realized through the proceeds of an initial public offering , not from royalties based on commer - cial sales . The results reported in Table 5 indicate that start - ups and established ﬁrms may operate as complementary , rather than substitute vehicles for commercialization of some technologies in university licensing . As Shane ( 2002 ) points out , established ﬁrms often have a competitive advantage in commercializing inventions . Conversely , inventors often have a com - parative advantage in development when the knowl - edge necessary to further develop the invention is largely tacit ( Shane 2002 , Lowe 2006 ) . Table 5 sug - gests that considering commercial outcomes such as time to ﬁrst sale or termination of licenses without a more detailed examination of the mode of com - mercialization reveals only part of the entrepreneurial story . There appears to be a delicate balance between established ﬁrms’ comparative advantage in com - mercialization , through superior access to comple - mentary assets , resources , and market knowledge , and inventors’ comparative advantage in developing early - stage technologies . Entrepreneurs function within a “market for ideas” and may choose a strategy of “competition” or “coop - eration” with established ﬁrms ( Gans and Stern 2000 , Gans et al . 2002 ) . Once they have licensed a university technology , entrepreneurs are not locked in over time to pursuing commercialization on their own , but may later choose to cooperate , via joint venture , acquisi - tion , or other linkages with established ﬁrms . With - out the entrepreneurial role of the inventor - founder however , some technologies would be left to languish , or licensed by established ﬁrms and unsuccessfully commercialized , as illustrated by our ﬁrst two intro - ductory examples . Thus , inventor - founded ﬁrms may serve a transitional organizational form in the market for technology commercialization and this division of labor—development in start - ups , commercialization in established ﬁrms—contributes to a “ﬁrst - best” out - come from a longer - term perspective . Our study is not without its limitations . Beyond technology and location dummies , we do not con - trol for more detailed characteristics of the inven - tions licensed other than department and campus of origin . Although our department controls are rough proxies for differences among technological ﬁelds , incorporating more precise measures of differences in appropriability , patent effectiveness , and technologi - cal opportunity across technical ﬁelds might improve our analysis . Moreover , the ﬁndings from this study are based on licensing activity at a single institu - tion , UC . The two studies closest to ours utilize data from MIT ( Shane 2002 , Dechenaux et al . 2003 ) . Shane’s ( 2002 ) ﬁnding that start - ups are more likely to ter - minate a license than an existing ﬁrm contradicts our result , but it is unclear whether this disparity is due to dissimilar licensing practices between UC and MIT or other systematic differences between the technologies or licensees in our respective data sets . It is also uncertain whether Shane’s conclusion that licensing university technology to start - ups represents a “second - best solution” would hold if he considered a longer postlicense time frame and possible acqui - sition activity . A more recent examination of licenses to MIT inventions reveals results closer to those of our study . Dechenaux et al . ( 2003 ) conduct an event - history analysis of time to ﬁrst sale and contract ter - mination using a sample comparable to ours ( patents issued between 1980 and 1996 ) . Consistent with our ﬁndings , they ﬁnd that start - ups are as likely as estab - lished ﬁrms to reach a ﬁrst sale . On the other hand , they ﬁnd little evidence that start - ups take longer to terminate a license than do existing ﬁrms . To test the inﬂuence of institution - speciﬁc factors on the licens - ing of university inventions , future research should D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 143 . 1 . 30 ] on 02 M a r c h 2017 , a t 15 : 51 .

Another limitation of our study , in line with other recent studies of overoptimism among entrepreneurs , is the difﬁculty in disentangling overoptimism from rationality - based explanations for decision - making behavior . For example , Åstebro ( 2003 ) found that an overwhelming majority of Canadian inventors who submitted their ideas to a nonproﬁt inventors’ assis - tance program for counsel on whether to pursue further development were advised to abandon com - mercialization efforts . Yet , half of the inventors receiv - ing this recommendation continued development despite the fact that the ex ante probability of reach - ing the marketplace was only 4 % and the median expected return , conditional on commercialization , D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 143 . 1 . 30 ] on 02 M a r c h 2017 , a t 15 : 51 .

Focused Issue : Overoptimism and the Performance of Entrepreneurial Firms Management Science 52 ( 2 ) , pp . 173 – 186 , ©2006 INFORMS 185 was negative . Although such behavior suggests overoptimism , other explanations are equally com - pelling . Despite a low expected probability of suc - cess , the distribution of realized returns to invention in Åstebro’s sample is highly skewed , much like that exhibited for university inventions . This suggests that inventor behavior may be driven by rational models of risk preferences or the skew distribution of returns rather than overoptimism . The difﬁculty in identifying overoptimism among alternative explanations in decision making high - lighted in our study and the Åstebro paper suggests that future research could seek more direct measures of overoptimism among individual decision makers . Malmendier and Tate ( 2005 ) identify personal char - acteristics of CEOs that are correlated with indi - rect measures of overoptimism in acquisition choices . Similarly , Barber and Odean ( 2001 ) ﬁnd that gender differences are systematically related to levels of over - conﬁdence in stock trading behavior . Less is known about how decision biases affect the process by which university technologies are commercialized . Our ﬁndings nevertheless offer insight into the commercialization process of licensed university tech - nologies . Entrepreneurs appear to “hold their own” relative to more established ﬁrms , particularly in the commercialization of early stage inventions requir - ing substantial technological development . Because a stated goal of most university technology transfer professionals is the development and introduction to the market products based on university research , our evidence suggests that the active pursuit of licensing to university start - ups is worthwhile .
