PERSPECTIVES ( FIG . 1 ) . In fact , multivesicular elements of late endosomes contain a complex system of internal membranes that are involved in both the degradation and recycling of pro - teins and lipids 8 . So , for clarity , in this arti - cle , we use the term ECV / MVB to refer strictly to the intermediates that are involved in transport from early to late endosomes , whereas MVE is used as a generic term for any ( early or late ) MVE in the degradation pathway ( FIG . 1 ) . Here , we first briefly describe the differ - ent MVEs and present our view on the pos - sible fate and functions of their internal membranes . Then , we focus more specifi - cally on the biogenesis of ECV / MVBs , and discuss recent evidence , which shows that downregulated , activated receptors are sorted into the internal membranes of newly forming ECV / MVBs by the molecular machinery that also drives the membrane - invagination process itself . Finally , we dis - cuss the mechanism that might , at least in part , be responsible for the detachment of newly formed ECV / MVBs from early endo - somal membranes . The different multivesicular endosomes Do early and late MVEs simply reflect dif - ferent views or stages of the same structure or are they , in fact , different structures ? Here , we will not dwell on this maturation - versus - stable - compartment debate . These two alternative models have already been discussed extensively elsewhere , and there is still no experimental evidence that proves either model . How do you discriminate between an ECV / MVB that forms as a result of recycling tubules detaching from an early endosome ( maturation model ) and one that forms as a result of direct detach - ment from an early endosome ( stable - com - partment model ) ( FIG . 1 ) ? Either way , each model could be used to explain the mecha - nisms that control ECV / MVB biogenesis , which are discussed in this article . And , beyond this debate , evidence is accumulat - ing that MVEs exhibit significant differ - ences in their protein / lipid composition and functions at different stages of the degradation pathway . Endocytosed recy - cling molecules and downregulated mole - cules are both delivered to early endosomes , and are then rapidly and efficiently segre - gated away from each other 9 . Whereas recycling receptors return to the cell sur - face , at least in part , through recycling endosomes 10 , downregulated epidermal - growth - factor receptor ( EGFR ) molecules are collected in ECV / MVBs , where they accumulate in the internal vesicles 11 ( FIG . 1 ) . Recent studies have shown that some down - regulated receptors are ubiquitylated and that this modification is responsible for sorting these receptors into newly forming ECV / MVBs through the action of HRS ( hepatocyte - growth - factor - regulated tyro - sine - kinase substrate ; see below ) and ESCRT - I , - II and - III ( endosomal sorting complex required for transport - I , - II and - III ; the role of ESCRTs has been recently reviewed in this journal 12 , so it will be dis - cussed here only briefly in BOX 1 ) . ECV / MVBs , as they form on early endoso - mal membranes , therefore selectively incorporate — in their membrane invagi - nations — receptors that are destined for late endosomes or lysosomes 13 , 14 . Once they have detached from early endo - somes , ECV / MVBs , which are typically spherical with a diameter of ~ 400 – 500 nm ( FIG . 2a , c ) , are translocated along microtubules towards late endosomes , with which they eventually fuse 15 – 17 . By contrast with ECV / MVBs , late endosomes are highly Recent progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the biogenesis of multivesicular transport intermediates in the degradation pathway that leads to lysosomes . Here , we discuss recent work that uncovers some of the mechanisms that cause both membrane invagination within these newly forming intermediates and the detachment of these intermediates from early endosomal membranes . To begin with , a brief discussion of nomenclature is required — that is , what are multivesicular endosomes ( MVEs ) ? Early electron - microscopy studies high - lighted the existence of vacuoles that were somehow related to lysosomes and that con - tained a characteristic accumulation of vesi - cles in their lumen . These structures were named multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ; for example , see REF . 1 ) . With the discovery of endosomes 2 , it became clear that endocy - tosed tracers that are destined to be degraded reach MVBs after being segregated from recycling receptors , but before they reach lysosomes 3 – 5 . Today , many people refer to MVBs as a form of late endosome , but , to avoid any confusion , we refer to an MVB as the transport intermediate between early and late endosomes — an intermedi - ate also known as an endosomal carrier vesicle ( ECV ) 6 . Indeed , all endosomes along the degradation pathway contain multi - vesicular elements , including regions of early endosomes ( that correspond to newly forming ECV / MVBs ) and late endosomes 7 NATURE REVIEWS | MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 5 | APRIL 2004 | 317 The biogenesis of multivesicular endosomes Jean Gruenberg and Harald Stenmark OPINION © 200 4 Nature PublishingGroup 318 | APRIL 2004 | VOLUME 5 www . nature . com / reviews / molcellbio P E R S P E C T I V E S endosomes , which occurs in cells from some , but perhaps not all 24 , patients with the choles - terol - storage disorder Niemann – Pick type C 8 . This indicates that the sorting and transport functions of late endosomes require their complex system of internal membranes . Until now , MVE cargoes that recycle to the limiting membrane of S . cerevisiae MVEs have not been identified . For example , MPR accumulates in the late - endosome internal membranes of mammalian cells that have impaired LBPA functions 18 , which is consis - tent with the view that MPR can cycle , at least to some extent , between the limiting and internal membranes . Vps10 ( vacuolar protein sorting 10 ) is the S . cerevisiae functional homologue of MPR and , like MPR , it cycles between the Golgi and endosomes . Its retrieval from endosomes is mediated by the retromer — a multimeric membrane - associ - ated complex . When retrieval is inhibited in retromer mutants , Vps10 is retained on the vacuolar ( limiting ) membrane , which indi - cates that Vps10 , unlike MPR , does not reach internal vesicles 25 . Also , S . cerevisiae cells obviously lack the regulated pathway that is present in dendritic cells and is followed by class II MHC molecules from late - endosome internal membranes to the cell surface . Even if a related recycling pathway does exist in S . cerevisiae , it is probably of lesser importance than in mammalian cells . An attractive view , therefore , is that sorting into ECV / MVBs is one of the mechanisms that regulates the degradation of the membrane constituents in the endocytic pathway — a mechanism that is conserved from S . cerevisiae to higher eukary - otic cells . However , higher eukaryotic cells seem to have evolved more elaborate mecha - nisms , which are perhaps dependent on LBPA , to ensure that some proteins and lipids can be efficiently retrieved from late - endosome inter - nal membranes and then transported to other cellular destinations . Linking sorting and invagination In contrast to late endosomes , little is known about the membrane composition of ECV / MVBs , apart from that they contain downregulated receptors . However , lipids might be selectively sorted into ECV / MVBs and might have a role in ECV / MVB biogene - sis , because the bilayer at the neck of newly forming invaginations might preferentially accommodate certain lipids owing to the high membrane curvature in this region 14 . Some lipid analogues that have a preference for more - ordered membrane domains are prefer - entially incorporated into ECV / MVBs 26 , and lipid - raft components are transported from early to late endosomes — at least in some cell The fate of internal membranes The discovery that EGFR accumulates in the internal membranes of MVEs led to the view that all internal membranes and their cargoes are destined to be degraded in lysosomes . So , is this always the case ? In Saccharomyces cerevisiae degradation mutants , internal vesicles accumulate in the vacuole ( the S . cerevisiae lysosome ) , which indicates that these vesicles would otherwise be degraded . However , the situation is proba - bly different in mammalian cells 8 . Although MVEs have been observed in S . cerevisiae 22 , membrane invaginations and internal vesicles seem to be far more abundant in the endo - somes of mammalian cells , and are readily visible at a steady state at all stages of the degradation pathway , as discussed above . Moreover , the internal membranes of mammalian late endosomes contain proteins that are exported to other cellular destina - tions , including MPRs that are in transit 7 , 18 and class II MHC molecules 21 . In addition , other proteins , which do not seem to be des - tined for degradation , accumulate in the internal membranes of MVEs — in particu - lar , tetraspanins 23 . Interestingly , LBPA is diffi - cult to degrade , and cholesterol and MPR transport are inhibited when LBPA function is disrupted . Furthermore , protein transport is affected by cholesterol accumulation in late pleiomorphic with cisternal , tubular and multivesicular regions , and their protein / lipid composition is distinct from that of ECV / MVBs . Typically , they contain large amounts of so - called lysosomal glycoproteins ( in particular , lysosomal - associated membrane protein - 1 ( LAMP1 ) and LAMP2 ) , which are very abundant in both late endosomes and lysosomes 7 . Strikingly , these proteins are often restricted to the limiting membranes of multi - vesicular late - endosomal elements . In addition , late endosomes also contain large amounts of lysobisphosphatidic acid ( LBPA ) . LBPA is abundant in late endosomes , in particular in their internal membranes , and is not found inother organelles 18 , 19 . Finally , in contrast to ECV / MVBs , late endosomes function as an important sort - ing station in the endocytic pathway . For example , the mannose - 6 - phosphate recep - tor ( MPR ) cycles , at least in part , from late endosomes back to the trans - Golgi network 20 , whereas class II major histocom - patibility complex ( MHC ) molecules are efficiently transported from late endo - somes ( or the class II MHC compartment ) to the plasma membrane in maturing den - dritic cells 21 . Multivesicular compartments in the degradation pathway ( FIG . 1 ) there - fore show significant functional and bio - chemical differences . Figure 1 | The degradation ( multivesicular ) pathway that leads to lysosomes . The different stages of the degradation pathway in mammalian cells are outlined ( solid arrows ) . Membrane invaginations and internal vesicles are shown in red , which highlights the tubular – cisternal and / or multivesicular regions of early and late endosomes . The compartments are not represented in a uniform scale , but late endosomes can be significantly larger and are more pleiomorphic than ECV / MVBs ( endosomal carrier vesicles / multivesicular bodies ) 7 , which are typically spherical with a diameter of ~ 0 . 4 – 0 . 5 µm ( REF . 6 ) . The outline also indicates , using dashed arrows , that recycling to the cell surface is believed to occur through both an indirect ( slow ) route through recycling endosomes and a direct ( rapid ) route , and that trafficking routes also connect the Golgi apparatus to early and late endosomes and the plasma membrane .

Direct evidence for a role for HRS in the lysosomal sorting of ubiq - uitylated membrane proteins comes from studies of S . cerevisiae mutants 12 , 39 , Drosophila melanogaster mutants 40 and small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - treated mammalian cells 41 , 42 . Although there is good evidence that HRS is a PtdIns3P effector in endosomal receptor sorting , recent studies indicate that this pro - tein also has a role in the formation of intralumenal endosomal vesicles . S . cerevisiae and D . melanogaster mutants that have impaired Hrs function have a reduced num - ber of intralumenal vesicles in endosomes and types 27 . In addition , phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate ( PtdIns3P ) was found to accumu - late within ECV / MVBs 28 , and evidence now shows that PtdIns3P signalling regulates receptor sorting into ECV / MVBs 29 . To sim - plify the proceeding discussion , we sequen - tially introduce the molecules that might control membrane invagination into ECV / MVBs , rather than follow a more holistic approach . We first briefly review the evidence supporting a role for PtdIns3P sig - nalling in this process . We then discuss why HRS is a probable PtdIns3P effector in this pathway , as well as examine the possible partners of HRS and how these partners might function . PtdIns3P and its effector proteins . Both the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor wortmannin and microinjected antibodies against VPS34 ( the mammalian PI3K that is responsible for the formation of PtdIns3P on endosomes ) inhibit the forma - tion of intralumenal vesicles in ECV / MVBs 30 , 31 . Similarly , the sequestration of endosomal PtdIns3P by a tandem FYVE ( Fab1 , YOTB , Vac1 , EEA1 ) domain inhibits the sorting of activated EGFRs into ECV / MVBs , whereas bulk transport between early and late endosomes remains unaf - fected 29 . These results indicate that PtdIns3P is required for growth - factor - receptor sort - ing , as well as for the formation of intralume - nal endosomal vesicles , but that it is not required for the formation of endosomal intermediates , which are equivalent to ECV / MVBs but presumably lack intralume - nal vesicles . But , what mechanisms are involved ? Two distinct protein domains — the FYVE domain and the PX ( Phox homol - ogy ) domain — can bind PtdIns3P , and there are 70 different mammalian proteins that each contain one of these domains . Indeed , recent data indicate that some of these pro - teins mediate endosomal receptor sorting and intralumenal vesicle formation . HRS and its associated proteins . So far , the best candidate for a PtdIns3P effector in the processes mentioned above is HRS . Recruitment of HRS to endosomal mem - branes requires PI3K activity 32 , 33 and the intact FYVE domain of HRS 34 . HRS recruits clathrin through a direct interaction 35 and is found in flat clathrin lattices on the limiting membrane of early endosomes and ECV / MVBs 36 , 37 . Unlike typical clathrin coats that are found at the plasma membrane , trans - Golgi network and endosomal tubules , the HRS - containing clathrin coat seems not to have a role in the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles . Instead , it might function in the sorting of ubiquity - lated membrane proteins . The covalent attachment of monoubiquitin to activated growth - factor receptors and other membrane proteins is a well - known signal for lysosomal targeting 38 . It is therefore interesting to note that HRS binds to ubiquitin through its ubiq - uitin - interacting motif , and that ubiquitylated proteins localize to HRS - and clathrin - con - taining microdomains on endosomes 36 . Indeed , the transferrin receptor — a non - ubiquitylated recycling receptor — does not accumulate in these microdomains , whereas activated EGFR ( which becomes NATURE REVIEWS | MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 5 | APRIL 2004 | 319 Box 1 | Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport A combination of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetics and biochemistry has led to the identification of three multisubunit complexes — endosomal sorting complexes required for transport - I , - II and - III ( ESCRT - I , - II and - III ) — that function in protein sorting into the intralumenal vesicles of endosomes ( see figure ; for a review , see REF . 12 ) . Genetic evidence indicates that the ESCRTs are recruited sequentially and function sequentially , in the order that corresponds to their numbers . S . cerevisiae cells that are devoid of ESCRT subunits have impaired protein sorting to the vacuole ( the equivalent of the mammalian lysosome ) and are defective in the formation of intralumenal vesicles . Both ESCRT - I and ESCRT - II contain ubiquitin - binding subunits ( vacuolar protein sorting ( Vps ) 23 and Vps36 , respectively ) that probably function in sorting ubiquitylated membrane proteins into endosomal invaginations . ESCRT - III consists of small , highly charged coiled - coil proteins that , in polymeric form , might participate in the inward vesiculation of the endosomal membrane . A homomultimeric ATPase , Vps4 , is required for the disassembly ( and therefore reuse ) of multimeric ESCRT subunits . Genetic evidence indicates that membrane proteins are de - ubiquitylated prior to their inclusion in intralumenal vesicles . Homologues of all ESCRT subunits have been found in mammalian cells , with the exception of Vps37 ( one of the ESCRT - I subunits ) . The mammalian ESCRTs probably function in a manner similar to their S . cerevisiae counterparts , although this remains to be investigated in detail . In addition to a function in endosomal sorting and the biogenesis of intralumenal vesicles , ESCRTs are also required for the budding of several RNA viruses , including human immunodeficiency virus .

The demonstration of a role for HRS in receptor sorting and intralumenal vesiculation does not rule out the possibility that other PtdIns3P - binding proteins might be involved in these processes . An interesting candidate is Fab1 , an S . cerevisiae PtdIns3P 5 - kinase , and its mammalian homologue PIKFYVE . Like HRS , Fab1 / PIKFYVE contains a FYVE domain that is crucial for its localization to endosome membranes 52 . S . cerevisiae FAB1 mutants have enormously expanded vac - uoles and show defective sorting of certain proteins into intralumenal vesicles 12 , 53 . Similarly , a dominant - negative PIKFYVE mutant causes the enlargement of endosomes in mammalian cells 54 . However , the ECV / MVB pathway is functional in FAB1 mutants , which indicates that Fab1 / PIKFYVE is not required for intralumenal vesiculation , but only for the sorting of a subset of pro - teins into intralumenal vesicles 55 . The recent finding that Vps24 ( a subunit of ESCRT - III ; BOX 1 ) interacts with phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ) — the cat - alytic product of Fab1 / PIKFYVE — indicates that PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 might function as an acti - vator of ESCRT - mediated protein sorting 56 . ECV / MVB biogenesis Protein sorting into ECV / MVBs seems to be coupled mechanistically to the mem - brane - invagination process through a PtdIns3P signalling pathway and HRS , but the protein - sorting machinery does not seem to have a direct role in the biogenesis of the actual ECV / MVB itself , as defined by the ECV / MVB limiting membrane 29 , 40 , 41 . So , what are the mechanisms that regulate the biogenesis of the ECV / MVB transport intermediate ? Recent studies indicate that annexin - II is part of the core machinery that regulates ECV / MVB biogenesis in mammalian cells 57 and that it also controls the distribution of recycling endosomes 58 . This is consistent with previous observations , which indi - cated that annexin - II has a role in endosomal membrane dynamics 59 , 60 . Annexins — which are not expressed in S . cerevisiae cells — form a family of 13 mammalian pro - teins , some of which are tissue specific . They are found both in the cytoplasm and bound to membranes , and are presumably involved in membrane - related processes , including membrane trafficking 61 . All annexins contain the endonexin fold ( a Ca 2 + - binding motif ) that is repeated four or eight times , and share the in vitro property of interacting with negatively charged phos - pholipids in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner . ESCRT - II and ESCRT - III 46 , HRS might be indirectly responsible for intralumenal vesicu - lation by initiating ESCRT recruitment to endosome membranes . HRS binds to the TSG101 / Vps23 ( tumour - susceptibility gene product 101 / ) subunit of ESCRT - I . Interestingly , this subunit of ESCRT - I is also involved in retrovirus ( Ebola and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ) bud - ding at the plasma membrane — a process topologically equivalent to endosomal invagi - nation 48 – 50 . So , the HIV Gag protein might highjack the ESCRT - I complex by mimicking the TSG101 - binding activity of HRS 45 . In con - trast to HIV budding from T - helper cells , most of the infectious HIV that is produced by primary macrophages is assembled on late endocytic membranes 51 , which presumably indicates that the virus can also use the ESCRT - I complex on endosomes . vacuoles 12 , 40 , and this effect can be reproduced in mammalian cells that have been treated with siRNA against HRS 41 ( FIG . 2a , b ) . But how does HRS control intralumenal vesiculation ? Genetic studies in S . cerevisiae indicate that ESCRT - I , - II and - III are required for the vac - uolar sorting of ubiquitylated receptors , as well as for formation of intralumenal vesicles ( for a review , see REF . 12 ) . ESCRTs are conserved in mammalian cells , in which they seem to have a function that is equivalent to that in S . cere - visiae 43 , 44 . A link between HRS and the ESCRTs was recently established by the finding that HRS binds to a subunit of ESCRT - I 41 , 45 – 47 , and that HRS is required for the recruitment of ESCRT - I to endosomal membranes . Moreover , the interaction between HRS and ESCRT - I is essential for the sorting of ubiquitylated cargo into the degradation pathway 46 , 47 . As ESCRT - I is thought to be required for the recruitment of Figure 2 | Ultrastructure of endosomes after HRS or annexin - II downregulation . a and b | HeLa cells treated with control RNA ( a ) or small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) against HRS ( hepatocyte - growth - factor - regulated tyrosine - kinase substrate ; b ) were incubated with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) for 15 minutes to allow endocytosis and then processed for electron microscopy . In control cells , HRP - positive ECV / MVBs ( endosomal carrier vesicles / multivesicular bodies ) could be readily detected ( arrowheads in a ) .

HRP accumulates in ECV / MVBs in control cells 6 ( arrowheads in c ) .

In addition , mutant RAB7 was reported to cause the accumulation of cathepsin - D and MPR in early endosomes 73 . This might indicate that this GTPase , which is found on late endosomes , has a role in protein export from early endosomes , which is consistent with the idea of partially over - lapping RAB platforms 74 . Summary and conclusions In summary , two crucial , sequential steps in the biogenesis of ECV / MVBs can now be dis - sected mechanistically in mammalian cells ( FIG . 3 ) . The silencing of HRS or ANXA2 expression indicates that membrane invagi - nation and the formation of a free ECV / MVB can be uncoupled , so these processes might occur sequentially during ECV / MVB biogen - esis . Evidence also shows that the the sorting of activated , ubiquitylated receptors into ECV / MVBs is coupled functionally to the membrane - invagination process through a PtdIns3P signalling pathway . Although the precise mechanism that drives the invagina - tion process is still unclear , progress has been made in our understanding of receptor sort - ing . A possible scenario is as follows : when ubiquitylated receptors arrive in early endo - somes they can bind HRS , which is retained at the membrane through its association with PtdIns3P . Through its interactions with clathrin , HRS sorts the ubiquitylated recep - tors into clathrin - coated domains of early endosomes . Presumably , the ubiquitylated receptors are then handed over to ESCRT - I and then sequentially to ESCRT - II and - III , which can drive both receptor incorporation into the membrane invaginations of newly forming ECV / MVBs and the membrane - invagination process itself . Next , the subse - quent biogenesis of newly formed ECV / MVBs seems to require annexin - II , which is presumably associated with choles - terol - rich platforms . Clearly , other mechanisms probably have a role in the formation of endosomal membranes in the early degradation path - way . Evidence now indicates that endoso - mal membranes are organized as a mosaic However , annexin - II associates with early endosomes , but perhaps not with the plasma membrane 62 , using an unconven - tional mechanism that is Ca 2 + - independent but cholesterol - dependent 59 , 63 . In fact , annexin - II might interact physically with membrane cholesterol . It is mislocalized to late endosomes that are loaded with choles - terol in Niemann – Pick type - C cells 57 . The downregulation of ANXA2 ( the gene that encodes annexin - II ) expression in siRNA - treated cells was reported to inhibit trans - port from early to late endosomes and ECV / MVB biogenesis , without interfering with the membrane - invagination process itself 57 . Indeed , multivesicular regions form , but they fail to detach from early endosomes and to become free ECV / MVBs . So , annexin - II seems to regulate the detach - ment of ECV / MVBs from early endosomes , but not the formation of the internal mem - branes ( FIG . 2c , d ) . Annexin - II seems to be associated with specialized domains of early endosomal membranes that are visible by electron microscopy 63 , which is consistent with the observations that some annexins tend to self - organize into bi - dimensional ordered arrays at the membrane surface 64 . It is therefore attractive to propose that annexin - II forms cholesterol - rich platforms that organize the membranes of early endosomes at the onset of the degradation pathway — a role that probably involves interactions with the actin cytoskeleton 63 , 65 . As S . cerevisiae cells do not express annexins , it seems reasonable to con - clude that higher eukaryotic cells have evolved further mechanisms that depend on annexin - II ( and presumably other factors ) and that reflect their need for the tight control of endosome membrane dynamics and ECV / MVB biogenesis . Indeed , the slow and rapid routes of protein recycling from early endosomes back to the cell sur - face , which represent the main trafficking routes in mammalian cells ( FIG . 1 ) , have not been observed in S . cerevisiae . If present , these routes are probably of lesser impor - tance in S . cerevisiae , and the main pathway might therefore be the formation of ECV / MVBs . By contrast , membrane compo - nents are mostly recycled in mammalian cells 66 , so these cells might well have evolved more elaborate mechanisms to regulate the onset of the degradation pathway . Other annexins , much like annexin - II , might define specific platforms on other cellular mem - branes , in particular annexin - XIII 67 , which perhaps provides a simple explanation for the numerous cellular functions that have been attributed to annexin - family members 61 . Other mechanisms probably contribute to the complex — and presumably robust — process of ECV / MVB biogenesis in mammalian cells . An endosomal coatomer protein ( COP ) complex and ARF1 ( ADP - ribosylation factor - 1 ) were proposed to have a role in transport to late endosomes and in ECV / MVB biogenesis 16 , 68 – 72 — perhaps upstream of annexin - II and HRS , because NATURE REVIEWS | MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 5 | APRIL 2004 | 321 Figure 3 | The ECV / MVB - related functions of HRS and annexin - II . a | The mechanisms that are involved in membrane invagination to form ECV / MVBs ( endosomal carrier vesicles / multivesicular bodies ) and in ECV / MVB detachment from early endosomes . HRS ( hepatocyte - growth - factor - regulated tyrosine - kinase substrate ) , which binds phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate ( PtdIns3P ) on early endosomes , recruits ubiquitylated epidermal - growth - factor receptor ( EGFR ) and sorts the receptor into unconventional clathrin - coated domains . Presumably , EGFR is then handed over to ESCRT - I ( endosomal sorting complex required for transport - I ) and then sequentially to ESCRT - II and - III , which drive both the incorporation of EGFR into the membrane invaginations of newly forming ECV / MVBs and the invagination process itself . It is still unclear how ESCRT complexes might drive this invagination process . The subsequent detachment of newly formed ECV / MVBs seems to require annexin - II , which is presumably associated with cholesterol - rich platforms . b | The lower panels illustrate the presumptive consequences of HRS and annexin - II downregulation .

NATURE REVIEWS | MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 5 | APRIL 2004 | 323 Most eukaryotes stabilize the ends of their linear chromosomes with a telomerase - based system . Telomerase maintains specific repetitive sequences , which protect chromosome ends with the help of telomere - binding proteins . How did this elaborate system evolve ? Here , I propose that telomere function was originally mediated by t - loops , which could have been generated by prokaryotic DNA - replication factors . These early telomeres would have required only the presence of a few repeats at chromosome ends . Telomerase could have been a later innovation with specific advantages for telomere function and regulation . At the time of their switch to linear genomes , eukaryotes must have evolved a mechanism to manage their chromosome ends . Chromosome ends create two major prob - lems . The DNA - replication machineries of all cells , regardless of their genome organization , use short RNA primers to initiate DNA syn - thesis . Removal of the terminal primer at the end of lagging - strand synthesis leaves a small gap that cannot be filled in . If left unfixed , this gap leads to the loss of terminal sequences . This is known as the end - replication problem . The second problem is that cells must distin - guish their natural chromosome ends from sites of DNA damage , so that checkpoint acti - vation and inappropriate repair are avoided . Present - day telomeres solve both problems . The protection and replication functions are currently provided by a telomere system that comprises the telomere - specific reverse transcriptase known as telomerase , an array of telomeric repeats that are created by telomerase , and telomere - specific proteins that bind to the telomeric repeats . The telomeric proteins protect chromosome ends from being recognized as sites of DNA damage and also regulate telomere - length maintenance by telomerase . The complexity of the telomerase - based telomere system has raised the question of how it evolved . Here , I discuss the possibility that eukaryotes originally existed without the benefits of telomerase or telomeric - DNA - binding proteins . I propose that these first eukaryotes could have stabilized their chro - mosome ends using the t - loop structure . If the ends contained a few terminal repeats , t - loops could have been generated by factors that were involved in recombination - depen - dent replication ( RDR ) , a form of DNA repli - cation that was already in existence before T - loops and the origin of telomeres Titia de Lange OPINION Figure 1 | Solutions to the end - replication problem . a | In eukaryotic chromosomes , the maintenance of terminal sequences is primarily facilitated by telomerase , which extends the 3 ′ terminus using reverse transcriptase ( RT in the figure ) and an RNA template . b | Dipteran insects solve the end - replication problem by retrotransposition , a pathway that is analogous to the telomerase pathway in that a reverse transcriptase uses the 3 ′ end of the chromosome as a primer for DNA synthesis using an RNA template . c | Experiments in telomerase - deficient Kluyveromyces lactis have provided evidence for rolling - circle replication in which the 3 ′ end is extended on an extrachromosomal circular template as a means of extension of chromosome ends . d | In Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains that lack telomerase , telomeric sequences can be maintained with a break - induced replication ( BIR ) / recombination - dependent replication ( RDR ) - like pathway in which one telomere uses another telomere as a template for extension . e | T - loop formation using terminal repeats and extension of the invaded 3 ′ end might be another mechanism of telomere maintenance . The figure only shows the elongation of the 3 ′ ends . For each pathway , elongation of the 5 ′ end will require further ( lagging - strand ) DNA synthesis , which could take place concomitantly with 3 ′ - end extension or in the next round of DNA replication . The blue boxes in parts a and b signify the sequence in the telomerase RNA and in the retrotransposon RNA , respectively , that will be added to the chromosome end by reverse transcription .
