Adenovirus Keratitis : A Role for Interleukin - 8 James Chodosh , 1 Roger A . Astley , 1 Mary G . Butler , 1 and Ronald C . Kennedy 2 P URPOSE . Adenovirus type 19 ( Ad19 ) infection of the human cornea results in a chronic , multifocal , subepithelial keratitis . Existing evidence suggests that early subepithelial corneal inﬁltrates are composed of polymorphonuclear neutrophils . In this study , the capacity of Ad19 - infected human corneal stromal ﬁbroblasts ( HCFs ) to produce neutrophil chemotactants ( chemokines ) was tested . M ETHODS . HCFs grown from human donor corneas and passaged thrice were infected with a corneal isolate of Ad19 or mock - infected with virus - free media . Bioactivity of the cell supernatants was tested by a neutrophil chemotaxis assay . Supernatants were assayed by enzyme - linked immu - nosorbent assay for the neutrophil chemotactants interleukin - 8 ( IL - 8 ) and GRO - a . Corneal facsim - iles were generated with HCFs and collagen type I , infected with Ad19 , and assayed by immuno - histochemistry . R ESULTS . Ad19 infection of HCFs increased neutrophil chemotaxis from a baseline of 0 . 4 6 0 . 7 cells / high - powered ﬁeld ( hpf ; mock - infected ) to 21 . 8 6 2 . 3 cells / hpf ( Ad19 - infected ) . Chemotaxis was reduced by the addition of neutralizing antibodies against IL - 8 and GRO - a . Infection of HCFs induced quantities of IL - 8 protein 300 - and 1000 - fold over mock - infected controls at 4 and 24 hours , respectively ( 33 versus 11 , 813 pg / mL at 4 hours , and 57 versus 76 , 376 pg / mL at 24 hours , P # 0 . 001 for both ) . In contrast , GRO - a protein levels were only sevenfold higher at 24 hours postinfection ( 118 pg / mL in mock - infected controls versus 880 pg / mL in Ad19 - infected cell supernatants ) . Neither chemokine was induced by infection of an immortalized human corneal epithelial cell line . Immunohistochemistry of infected corneal facsimiles demonstrated IL - 8 in the extracellular matrix within 3 days after infection . C ONCLUSIONS . Production of chemokines in infected tissues facilitates an early innate immune response to infection , and in the infected corneal stroma represents an elementary defense mechanism . Interleukin - 8 may play a role in the development of subepithelial inﬁltrates in adeno - virus keratitis . ( Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci . 2000 ; 41 : 783 – 789 ) E pidemic keratoconjunctivitis ( EKC ) , caused most com - monly by adenoviral serotypes 8 , 19 , and 37 , is the only adenoviral syndrome associated with corneal in - ﬂammation . Keratitis in EKC characteristically presents with multiple corneal inﬁltrates in the subepithelial stroma be - ginning 1 to 2 weeks after onset of the conjunctivitis . The corneal inﬁltrates of EKC cause signiﬁcant ocular morbidity ; reduced vision , photophobia , and foreign body sensation may persist for months to years after infection . 1 Early cellu - lar constituents of corneal inﬁltrates in the human with adenovirus keratitis remain unknown . However , the ﬁrst inﬂammatory cell in human tears after the onset of conjunc - tivitis in EKC is the polymorphonuclear neutrophil , 2 and in experimental animal models of adenovirus infection , inﬁl - trates consisted of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in early stages 3 and lymphocytes later on . 4 The cells in residence within the normal human corneal stroma , the keratocytes , maintain the corneal stroma extra - cellular matrix in a precisely organized and transparent state . In addition to their maintenance functions in the healthy eye , keratocyte responses to corneal wounding are critical to healing . 5 The signiﬁcant inﬂammatory response to stromal infection by a diverse array of pathogens suggests an additional biological role for keratocytes : the capacity to amplify acute inﬂammation in the presence of infection . Indeed , keratocytes secrete proinﬂammatory chemokines , such as the neutrophil chemotactants interleukin - 8 ( IL - 8 ) 6 and GRO - a , 7 in response to a variety of chemical and infec - tious stimuli , 8 – 10 and may contribute to necrotizing corneal stromal inﬂammation due to herpes simplex virus 11 and Gram - negative bacteria . 12 , 13 Thus , keratocytes play a key role in the inﬂammatory retort to both corneal injury and invasion . We hypothesize that the inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrates in the adenovirus - infected cornea represent focal areas of stromal infection and manifest due to upregulation of neutrophil che - motactants by keratocytes . We examined adenovirus - infected human corneal cells for their capacity to induce neutrophil chemotaxis by the secretion of chemokines , and used an in vitro model of infection that mimics infection of the human corneal stroma in vivo .

Corneal fragments were removed before monolayer conﬂuence . Cells were grown and maintained at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . The cell monolayers were used at passage three . After serial passage in serum - containing media , keratocytes maintain a ﬁbroblast pheno - type 14 and are referred to in the remainder of this article as human corneal ﬁbroblasts ( HCFs ) . A ﬁbroblast phenotype was conﬁrmed by indirect immunoﬂuorescent staining with poly - clonal anti - vimentin ( positive reactivity ) and anti - cytokeratin ( no reactivity ) antibodies by methods described previously . 15 Immortalized human corneal epithelial cells ( HCECs ) kindly provided by Araki – Sasaki , Suita , Japan , 16 were used as a con - trol . HCECs were grown and maintained in Deﬁned Keratino - cyte - Serum Free Media ( Life Technologies ) at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . Corneal facsimiles 17 were generated by seeding HCFs at a ﬁnal concentration of 10 5 cells / ml in rat tail collagen , type I ( Becton Dickinson , Bedford , MA ) , prepared according to the company’s instructions . While still in the ﬂuid phase , the HCF / collagen mixture was plated in individual 6 . 5 - mm Transwell tissue culture inserts ( Costar , Cambridge , MA ) at 300 [ mu ] l / insert , and the inserts placed in 12 - well tissue culture plates . The facsimiles were allowed to gel brieﬂy at room temperature , then fed with DMEM 10 % FBS with antibiotics , and incubated overnight at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils were isolated by a technique adapted from that of Harvath et al . 18 Twenty - ﬁve milliliters of whole blood , harvested from volunteer donors , was overlayed onto 15 ml of Lymphocyte Separation Medium ( Life Technologies ) , followed by centrifugation at 1000 g for 20 minutes . The neutrophil / erythrocyte layer was gently mixed with 8 ml of 6 % dextran solution , followed by low - speed centrifugation and resuspension in 200 m l calcium / magnesium - free phosphate - buffered saline . The erythrocytes were lysed thrice by the addition of 10 ml ice - cold distilled water and 5 ml of 3 . 6 % NaCl followed by a gentle vortex and low - speed cen - trifugation . Neutrophil viability was assessed by trypan blue staining . Adenovirus type 19 ( Ad19 ) cultured directly from the cornea of a patient with EKC was grown in human lung carcinoma cells ( A549 cells , CCL 185 ; American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , MD ) in minimum essential medium with 2 % FBS , penicillin G sodium , streptomycin sulfate , and ampho - tericin B . The State of Oklahoma Department of Health con - ﬁrmed the viral serotype . Typical adenoviral cytopathic effect , positive immunoﬂuorescent staining for adenovirus hexon pro - teins , and increasing titers of virus within 1 week after infec - tion of human corneal cells with this virus have been previ - ously described . 15 Adenovirus stock was puriﬁed by cesium chloride gradient . The Tissue Culture Infectious Dose ( TCID ) of the puriﬁed Ad19 preparation was determined , and the virus stored at 2 80°C . Adenoviral Infection of Human Corneal Cells Cells grown to 95 % conﬂuence in 48 - well plates were washed gently with OptiMEM ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) . The plates were infected in duplicate or triplicate with puriﬁed Ad19 at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10 or with Opti - MEM without virus as a control . Virus was adsorbed at 37°C for 1 hour before the addition of additional OptiMEM to virus - and mock - infected cultures . At 4 and 24 hours after viral adsorp - tion , cell supernatants were aspirated , centrifuged to remove cellular debris , and stored at 2 20°C for subsequent experi - ments . In viral growth curve studies , cells and supernatants were removed together at select times post - adsorption with the assistance of a cell scraper , freeze - thawed , centrifuged , and the resultant supernatants titered in triplicate in A549 cells . Corneal facsimiles were infected with puriﬁed Ad19 at a MOI of 10 based on the number of cells seeded in each Transwell tissue culture insert on the day before infection . Neutrophil Chemotaxis Assay A neutrophil chemotaxis assay was performed according to previously published methods . 18 Four - hour infected or mock - infected HCF supernatants were placed in the bottom well of blind - well chambers ( Poretics , Livermore , CA ) and each well covered with a polyvinyl - pyrrolidone - free 3 - m m pore size poly - carbonate ﬁlter ( Poretics ) . Monoclonal antibody to IL - 8 ( 10 m g / ml , MAB208 ; R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) and GRO - a ( 5 m g / ml , MAB275 ; R & D ) were added to the viral - infected supernatants in separate experimental chambers . Concentra - tions of monoclonal antibodies were chosen to maximally inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis . Freshly isolated human neutro - phils with greater than 90 % viability by trypan blue exclusion were diluted at 10 6 viable cells / ml in OptiMEM and placed above the polycarbonate ﬁlter for incubation of 1 hour at 37°C . The membranes were then gently removed , and any neutro - phils on the top of the membrane gently scraped off with a scalpel . The membrane was then placed bottom side up on a glass slide and ﬁxed in methanol for 2 minutes , air - dried , and stained with Diff - Quick ( Dade Diagnostics , Aguada , PR ) . Neu - trophils on the bottom of the membrane were counted in masked fashion in 10 high - powered ﬁelds ( hpfs ) for each slide with an Axiovert 135 microscope ( Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) . The capacity of virus - versus mock - infected cell supernatants to induce neutrophil chemotaxis was compared by Student’s t - test . A value of P , 0 . 05 was considered signiﬁcant . Enzyme - Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Neutrophil Chemotactants In separate experiments , viral - infected and mock - infected , trip - licate , 4 - and 24 - hour postinfection HCF and HCEC superna - tants were assayed by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) for IL - 8 ( Cytoscreen immunoassay kit ; Biosource , Cam - arillo , CA ) and GRO - a ( Quantikine Immunoassay , R & D ) pro - teins , according to the manufacturers’ instructions . Tumor necrosis factor - a ( TNF - a ; Genzyme , Cambridge , MA ) , diluted in OptiMEM to 500 U / ml , was used as a positive control to stimulate chemokine production in the absence of virus . 11 The speciﬁcity of the ELISA was evaluated by the addition of anti - IL8 or anti – GRO - a at concentrations of 1 or 10 m g / ml ( IL - 8 ) and 0 . 05 m g / ml ( GRO - a ) before virus adsorption . Plates were read on an Emax microplate reader ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) and analyzed with SOFTmax analysis software ( Molecular 784 Chodosh et al .

The means of triplicate ELISA values for each of the virus - or mock - infected wells were compared by Student’s t - test . Immunohistochemistry on Corneal Facsimiles At various times after infection with Ad19 , facsimiles were removed from the tissue culture inserts and ﬁxed in 10 % neutral - buffered formalin before parafﬁn embedding and cut - ting of 5 - m m sections . Immunohistochemistry was performed for IL - 8 using polyclonal goat anti - human IL - 8 antibody ( R & D ) , and for adenovirus capsid antigen using monoclonal mouse anti - adenovirus antibody ( Cell Marque , Austin , TX ) followed by a biotinylated rabbit anti - goat antibody ( DAKO , Carpinteria , CA ) or biotinylated anti - mouse antibody ( BioPath , Oklahoma City , OK ) , respectively . The reaction was developed using an Ultra - LINK horseradish peroxidase detection kit ( BioPath ) . Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and photo - graphed on an Axiovert 135 microscope ( Zeiss ) . R ESULTS Ad19 - Infected HCFs Secrete Neutrophil Chemotactants Adenoviral titers in HCECs rose from 38 TCID / cell after 1 hour of viral adsorption to 190 TCID / cell 24 hours postinfection , an approximately ﬁvefold rise . Over the same 24 hours , adenovi - ral titers in HCFs rose from 7 TCID / cell to 628 TCID / cell , an approximately 90 - fold rise ( Fig . 1 ) . At 4 hours postinfection , no viral growth was evident in either HCECs or HCFs . Superna - tants of 4 - hour Ad19 - infected HCECs elicited no neutrophil migration ( data not shown ) . Supernatants from 4 - hour viral - infected HCFs induced neutrophil chemotaxis of 21 . 8 6 2 . 3 cells / hpf , whereas 4 - hour mock - infected HCF supernatants did not induce measurable neutrophil migration ( P , 0 . 0001 by Student’s t - test ; Fig . 2 ) . Addition of saturating concentrations of monoclonal antibody to IL - 8 reduced Ad19 infection – induced chemotaxis to close to uninfected levels . Anti – IL - 8 and anti – GRO - a together completely inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis . Ad19 - Infected HCFs Secrete IL - 8 Viral - and mock - infected corneal cell supernatants were as - sayed by ELISA for neutrophil chemotactants . After 24 hours of infection , IL - 8 secretion was greater in Ad19 - infected HCECs than in mock - infected HCECs ( P # 0 . 01 ) , but the level of IL - 8 in infected HCEC supernatants reached only 80 pg / ml ( Fig . 3A ) . GRO - a secretion was below the sensitivity of the assay for both infected and uninfected HCECs ( data not shown ) . Infec - tion of HCFs for 4 and 24 hours induced quantities of IL - 8 protein 300 - and 1000 - fold , respectively , over mock - infected controls ( 33 versus 11 , 813 pg / ml at 4 hours , P # 0 . 001 , and 57 versus 76 , 376 pg / ml at 24 hours , P # 0 . 001 ; Fig . 3B ) . In contrast , GRO - a protein levels in infected HCF supernatants were only sevenfold higher than in uninfected controls at 24 hours and achieved much lower levels than seen for IL - 8 ( 118 pg GRO - a / ml in mock - infected versus 880 pg / mL in Ad19 - infected HCF supernatants at 24 hours , P # 0 . 002 ; Fig . 4 ) . Ad19 Infection of HCFs within an Extracellular Matrix Induces IL - 8 Secretion into the Surrounding Tissue By immunohistochemistry , IL - 8 protein within extracellular matrix became apparent in corneal facsimiles 3 days after infection ( Fig . 5B ) . At earlier times after infection , IL - 8 was not apparent by immunohistochemical staining ( data not shown ) . At 3 days postinfection , infected HCFs within the facsimiles appeared swollen and cytopathic and expressed adenovirus hexon proteins ( Fig . 5E ) , signifying active viral replication . Uninfected facsimiles were negative for IL - 8 ( Fig . 5A ) and adenovirus hexon protein ( Fig . 5D ) . Infected facsimiles tested without primary antibody showed appropriately negative ex - pression of IL - 8 ( Fig . 5C ) and adenovirus ( Fig . 5F ) . F IGURE 1 .

Jones’ model does not take into account the potential contribution of ker - atocytes to the inﬂammatory cascade . We hypothesize that after corneal epithelial infection with adenoviruses , 20 multifo - cal subepithelial inﬁltrates in EKC develop due to stromal infection and upregulation of inﬂammatory cell chemotactants by corneal stromal cells . Chemokines are produced by nearly all human cells and cause leukocyte chemotaxis with a high degree of speciﬁcity . Because of existing evidence that polymorphonuclear neutro - phils inﬁltrate the corneal stroma in EKC , 3 we focused our attention on neutrophil - speciﬁc chemokines . Perhaps the best characterized chemokine , IL - 8 is produced by a variety of human cells and strongly and selectively induces neutrophil chemotaxis and degranulation with a long duration of action . 6 Tissue infection , ischemia , and trauma each can lead to the induction of IL - 1 and TNF - a , and these cytokines strongly induce IL - 8 production by multiple cell types , 21 including HCFs . 8 Herpes simplex virus infection 11 and UV light 22 induce IL - 8 synthesis by HCFs . These data suggest that IL - 8 induction could be a ﬁnal common pathway of corneal inﬂammation for a variety of corneal tissue insults . In our study , we demon - strated neutrophil chemotaxis toward supernatants of adeno - virus - infected HCFs , with inhibition of chemotaxis in the pres - ence of antibody against IL - 8 , and increased levels of IL - 8 protein in infected HCF supernatants . Under our experimental conditions , infection induced only modest increases in secre - tion of GRO - a , another neutrophil chemotactant . Our data also showed no appreciable induction of neutrophil chemotaxis and minimal increases in IL - 8 production by adenovirus - in - fected HCECs . Taken together , these data are consistent with the clinical observation of signiﬁcant neutrophil migration into an infected cornea when the pathogen has breached the stroma . It remains unclear whether a complete viral replicative cycle is necessary for adenovirus to induce chemokine synthe - sis by HCFs . Trousdale and coworkers 4 demonstrated subepi - thelial inﬁltrates in rabbit corneas after intrastromal injection of a replication - deﬁcient adenovirus strain , suggesting that pro - duction of infectious virus is not a prerequisite for stromal inﬂammation . Indeed , Bruder and Kovesdi 23 showed IL - 8 pro - duction by A549 cells in the presence of UV - inactivated but not heat - inactivated adenoviral gene vectors , suggesting that the interaction between the adenovirus and its cellular receptor is necessary and sufﬁcient to induce IL - 8 gene transcription . These observations are consistent with one aspect of Jones’ theory 19 of subepithelial inﬁltrate formation : The presence of nonreplicating viral components in the corneal stroma may be sufﬁcient to induce an inﬂammatory signal . Finally , because of a lack of immunologic reagents for available animal models of adenovirus corneal infection , 3 , 24 we used the cornea facsimile model 17 to study adenovirus infec - tion of human corneal cells in a simulated tissue microenviron - ment . Although an oversimpliﬁcation of the human cornea , F IGURE 2 . Neutrophil chemotaxis assay . HCFs were infected with puriﬁed Ad19 for 4 hours and the cell - free supernatants harvested . Freshly isolated human neutrophils were placed across from infected and mock - infected HCF supernatants in blind well chambers separated by 3 - m m pore polycarbonate mem - branes . After incubation for 1 hour at 37°C , membranes were stained with Diff - quick and mounted on glass slides . Neutrophils that migrated through the membranes were counted in masked fashion , and the number of cells in 10 hpfs averaged for each experiment . Error bars represent SD of the mean . Monoclonal antibodies to IL - 8 ( 10 m g / ml ) and GRO - a ( 5 m g / ml ) were added as indicated ( P , 0 . 0001 for Ad19 HCF supernatants versus mock - infected control ) . The experiment was repeated twice with comparable results using cells from different human donors . 786 Chodosh et al .

The demonstration of IL - 8 within the “stroma” of an infected corneal facsimile is signiﬁcant , because IL - 8 does not reach appreciable intracellu - lar levels and does not speciﬁcally bind to collagen . We pro - pose that the subepithelial location of adenovirus - induced in - ﬂammatory inﬁltrates in the cornea may be due to the presence of potential binding sites for IL - 8 in the region of Bowman’s and epithelial basement membranes , as has been suggested by investigations in other systems . 25 In summary , the induction of chemokines by infected tissues ampliﬁes the innate immune response to the infec - tion . In the infected cornea , chemokine production and subsequent leukocyte inﬁltration may conﬁne the pathogen and potentially prevent its entrance into the interior of the eye . In adenovirus keratitis , the induction of neutrophil migration into the cornea might serve to limit the extent and duration of infection . Our data support the potential role of IL - 8 in the pathogenesis of adenovirus - induced subepithelial corneal inﬁltrates . References 1 . Duke – Elder S . System of Ophthalmology , Vol .
