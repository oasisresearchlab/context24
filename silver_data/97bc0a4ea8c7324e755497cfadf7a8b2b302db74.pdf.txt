For example , localized activation of the epidermal growth [ 42 ] did not inhibit Nck - mediated formation of actin tails and foci ( Figure 8 ) .

In the present study , sev - eral lines of evidence convincingly demonstrate that N - WASp is indeed an essential component in the signal - ing cascade that links Nck with localized polymerization of actin .
