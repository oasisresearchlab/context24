For those not aware of the prevailing situation this could be a little mis - leading , due to the fact that the electron microscopical work was performed entirely by Bob Horne , the bacteriophage sam - ples under study having been produced by Sydney Brenner . Bob Horne , with his colleagues , subsequently continued to make a major contribution to methodological aspects of negative staining and the application of the technique to many different biological samples . Although numerous variants of negative staining have been introduced through the intervening years , the underlying principle that a thin layer of biological material is surrounded , 0968 - 4328 / $ – see front matter © 2009 Elsevier Ltd . All rights reserved . doi : 10 . 1016 / j . micron . 2010 . 06 . 003 118 S . De Carlo , J . Robin Harris / Micron 42 ( 2011 ) 117 – 131 permeated , supported and embedded by a dried amorphous or frozen - hydrated / vitreous layer of heavy metal - containing cationic or anionic salt remains unchanged . An electron image is generated primarily by the differential electron scattering due to the mass - thickness ( density × thickness ) difference between the biological material and the surrounding stain layer . Clearly there might be a difference between negative staining with heavy metal cations or anions , in that one or other may bind directly to oppositely charged groups on the surface of the biological material ( i . e . posi - tive staining ) , a feature that has not yet been critically addressed . In practice there does not appear to be a major difference , but the acidic staining conditions with cationic negative stains can sig - niﬁcantly inﬂuence biological samples , sometimes stabilizing but on other occasions producing undesirable aggregation . With the anionic negative stains , molecular dissociation can occur during specimen preparation , but this is a rare event . 1 . 2 . Air - dried negatively stained specimens Perhaps the best that can be expected from negative staining is that it should reveal the true solvent - excluded surface and shape of a biological molecule or other particle . In theory , intra - molecular information such as alpha - helices or beta - sheets are unlikely to be revealedbynegativestaining , whichreliesupontherelativelylarge mass - thickness difference between the biological material and the surrounding stain , rather than upon the more subtle difference of varying mass - thickness of protein , carbohydrate and nucleic acid molecules versus the surrounding vitreous water / ice , which is the case for cryo - electron microscopy of unstained vitriﬁed specimens . Defocus - induced phase contrast , which is important for unstained biologicalspecimens , isalsothoughttocontributetoelectronimag - ing by negative stain ( Massover , 2008a ) . The use of trehalose alone as an embedding medium generates a thin supportive ﬁlm of mass - thickness marginally greater than that of a layer of vitreous water , within which viruses and large protein molecules and polymers can be revealed ( Harris and Schefﬂer , 2002 ) , whereas contrast matching tends to occur for smaller molecules . These interme - diate mass - thickness conditions have yet to be fully exploited , although glucose and trehalose have been widely used as preser - vation and contrast - inducing materials for electron imaging of 2D protein crystals ( Hirai et al . , 1999 ) . Strictly speaking , carbohydrates when used alone cannot be considered as negative stains , but as these useful compounds can be mixed with the established neg - ative stains , it is appropriate to be aware of their often helpful properties . One point that is often neglected is that following air - drying of a negatively stained specimen , a considerable quantity of water remains bound to the biological material and within the seem - ingly amorphous surrounding stain . Once inserted into the entry chamber of the electron microscope and subjected to the high vac - uum , this bound water will be rapidly removed . However , if an air - dried negatively stained specimen is cooled with liquid nitro - gen in a cryo - transfer holder , transferred to and maintained within the electron microscope under low temperature conditions , the bound water will not be removed , as indeed is the case throughout the cryo - negative staining procedure ( see below ) . It should also be borne in mind that cryo - negatively stained vitriﬁed specimens can be freeze - dried within the electron microscope , for comparative electron imaging following the removal of vitreous water ( Adrian et al . , 1998 ) . Several reviews on negative staining ( Harris et al . , 2006 ; Ohi et al . , 2004 ; Padrón and Alamo , 2004 ) and book chapters ( Harris , 1999 , 2007 ; Harris and Adrian , 1999 ; Harris and Horne , 1991 ) have appeared in recent years that cover thoroughly a number of tech - nical aspects and applications ; some of these are available online : [ http : / / www . springerprotocols . com / Abstract / doi / 10 . 1007 / 978 - 1 - 59745 - 294 - 6 7 ; http : / / springerprotocols . com / Abstract / doi / 10 . 1385 / 1 - 59259 - 201 - 5 : 13 ; http : / / related . springerprotocols . com / searchrelated ? to = VSyekn5sdL & dataSource [ ] = springer protocols ] . In addition , a monograph within the Royal Microscopical Society ( RMS ) MicroscopyHandbook series ( No . 35 ) wasdevotedtonegative staining and cryo - electron microscopy ( Harris , 1997 ) . Thus , the present review is not intended as a repetition of what has already been published , rather we wish to address a number of technical points that we consider of signiﬁcance and of likely interest and value to researchers through the coming years . Inevitably our approach will be personal , dwelling on our own experience and publications within the ﬁelds of macromolecular structure , but where relevant we will also refer to the published examples of others who have made a recent or signiﬁcant contribution to the subject . In the main , detailed protocols for performing negative staining of air - dried specimens will not be given here . Instead , referencing to the relevant publications will be provided . Images describing several examples of the different negative staining approaches will be given , primarily from our own available data . Much of the early negative stain TEM data on macromolecules and viruses remains perfectly valid and useful , although to some thismayseemtorepresent“stoneage”low - resolutioninformation . Nevertheless , despite its 50 - year existence and undoubted limita - tions , the negative staining technique continues to be used widely within the ﬁelds of virology and microbiology ( Ackermann , 2009 ; Guo et al . , 2009 ; Mast and Demeestere , 2009 ) , cell biology ( Nakane and Miyata , 2009 ) , protein and lipid biochemistry ( Gantz et al . , 2000 ; Hudson et al . , 2009 ; Kuchibhatla et al . , 2009 ; Radermacher et al . , 2006 ; Luik et al . , 2009 ; Zhang , 2009 ) , polymer and colloid science ( Harrisetal . , 1999 ; Ojogunetal . , 2009 ) andfortheexamina - tion of pharmaceutical preparations ( Hamilton and Walker , 2005 ) . The reason for this is the overall simplicity of the basic technique and its successful application within so many systems . Indeed , as a screeningprocedureitisalsoextremelyusefulasameansbywhich the quality of protein and other sample material can be rapidly assessed before devoting time and expense to cryo - electron micro - scopical or other studies such as X - ray crystallography . A critical comparison of negative staining and vitreous ice for the production of 3D macromolecular reconstructions was presented by Hoenger and Aebi ( 1996 ) the conclusions of which , namely that both tech - niques have their strengths and limitations , remain essentially the same today . Indeed , several groups now routinely employ nega - tive staining together with cryo - electron microscopy of unstained proteins in parallel ( e . g . Pires et al . , 2009 ) . 1 . 3 . Cryo - negative staining The currently used cryo - negative staining methodology devel - oped from a productive collaboration between one of us ( JRH ) and the Lausanne - based cryo - electron microscopists Marc Adrian and Jacques Dubochet ( see Adrian et al . , 1998 ) , in an attempt to produce superior sample preservation and image resolution , compared to the conventional negative staining technique with air - dried speci - mens . This topic was reviewed brieﬂy by Harris and Adrian ( 1999 ) and Harris et al . ( 2006 ) . Thus it is now appropriate that a more complete and up - to - date survey of cryo - negative staining should be presented here , together with a detailed protocol . In reality the concept of cryo - negative staining is not new . Already at the beginning of the 1980s , Lepault et al . tried to add solutes to the solution prior to vitriﬁcation . The fact that solutes are not segregated in vitreous ice makes it possible to increase the density of the medium , thus changing the contrast of embed - ded particles ( Lepault et al . , 1983 ) . The problem is that when a compound like metrizamide ( a tri - iodinated benzamido deriva - tive of glucose ) is added to the buffer prior to vitriﬁcation , a situation is reached where the contrast is dramatically reduced S . De Carlo , J . Robin Harris / Micron 42 ( 2011 ) 117 – 131 119 ( contrast matching ) . When the surrounding solute concentration is increased , contrast inversion is obtained ( with ∼ 30 % metriza - mide ) , and the particles appear in the EM image to be negatively stained , surrounded by the higher density metrizamide . However , in this situation the ﬁne structural internal details of metrizamide - embedded biological particles are not revealed , making this embedding technique essentially useless for high - resolution 3D structure determination . Other attempts were carried out by Christoph Böttcher at the Fritz - Haber - Institute of the Max - Planck - Society in Berlin but pub - lishedafterhismovetoImperialCollege . Böttcheretal . ( 1997 ) tried tomixconventionalnegativestainswiththesampleinthesolution , immediately before vitriﬁcation , with the stain concentration kept below 2 % . Due to this low stain concentration within the very thin vitriﬁed specimen , the contrast obtained by Böttcher and cowork - ers did not appear to be signiﬁcantly different from conventional cryo - EM preparations . Marc Adrian developed the current version of the cryo - negative staining technique more than 10 years ago in the lab of Jacques Dubochet ( Adrian et al . , 1998 ) . From a method - ological point of view , this sample preparation technique is very similar to the thin ﬁlm vitriﬁcation technique ( Adrian et al . , 1984 ) , with the exception of an additional step : a short time of contact between the biological sample and the negative stain ( see Section 3 , below ) . As a result , the biological sample is entrapped in a thin ﬁlmofvitriﬁedhighconcentrationammoniummolybdatesolution , used essentially at a saturation concentration ( ∼ 0 . 8M ) . However , if thiscryo - methodologyisanalogoustoconventionalnegativestain - ing , the results obtained with this cryo - negative staining technique arecompletelydifferent , andinouropinionexceptional . Thesignal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) is amazingly higher , making it possible to visualizethebiologicalsampleswithanextraordinarylevelofdetail and clarity . In the ﬁrst published work ( Adrian et al . , 1998 ) , a large number of different samples were presented as successful exam - ples of the technique : icosahedral viruses , isolated proteins and even thin catalase crystals . An electron imaging resolution of ∼ 10Å wasshown , with3 . 3Åfromelectrondiffractionofthecatalasecrys - tals . The gain in SNR has been demonstrated by the straightforward comparison of the same samples , imaged in both unstained vitri - ﬁedandcryo - negativelystainedconditions . In2002weattempteda more quantitative analysis on a well - known sample . We compared unstained vs . cryo - negatively stained GroEL imaged on a 100kV LaB 6 EM and measured the effect of increasing exposure electron doses on the spectral signal - to - noise ratio ( SSNR ) . Two important observations were made . First , in the presence of frozen - hydrated ammonium molybdate , GroEL was preserved to 14Å resolution , even after a total cumulative dose of 36el . / Å 2 . Second , the SNR was increased by a factor of 5 as compared with the same particles imagedinthesamecondition , butinunstainedcryo - EM ( DeCarloet al . , 2002 ) . The major interest is the high contrast of cryo - negatively stained particles ; they can be imaged close to focus thus better preserving the high - resolution information , even when access to a ﬁeld - emission gun ( FEG ) microscope is not available ( De Carlo et al . , 2002 ) . For instance , the DNA packaging was clearly shown in bacteriophage T2 capsids . Nevertheless , this advantage was not demonstrated quantitatively : the 3D reconstruction of the TBSV virus 2D crystal did not show an improved result , perhaps due to the small number of virus particles present and the 2D crystal disorder . An improved resolution was claimed but this ﬁrst encour - aging pioneering work left unanswered many important biological questions . The most important is whether the biological struc - ture is preserved down to atomic resolution for non - crystalline objects . This question can be asked using other words : does the negative stain penetrate deeply within the protein , and if yes , to what extent ( i . e . what kind of internal details can be revealed ) ? We will present data to address this difﬁcult question ( see Section 3 ) . Table 1 The principal heavy metal negative staining salts .

Negative staining of air - dried specimens : techniques , results and discussion 2 . 1 . Conventional negative staining on continuous carbon ﬁlms The most commonly used negative stains are listed in Table 1 . A number of examples of biological samples adsorbed to carbon support ﬁlms and contrasted for electron imaging by surrounding the material with a thin aqueous ﬁlm of negative stain solution and allowing it to air - dry will now be given . Relevant technical commentsonthestainsandonspecimenpreparationwillbegiven , ratherthanfullprotocols , whichinallcasesareavailableelsewhere in the literature . Uranyl acetate , despite its cationic reactivity towards biolog - ical materials and the acidity of the aqueous solution , continues to be widely used as a negative stain . It is often the ﬁrst choice for initial TEM screening of an unknown sample or for rapid preliminary biological structure quality assessment . The main dis - advantage of uranyl acetate for high magniﬁcation studies is the granular / microcrystalline nature of the dried stain and its sensi - tivity to the electron beam . The latter can be offset by the use of low dose imaging . Uranyl formate has continued to be used successfully by some , primarily because of the ﬁner grain of the dried amorphous layer of stain ( Charalambous et al . , 2009 ; Min et al . , 2002 ) . Of the anionic negative stains , ammonium molyb - date is considered by many as the most suitable , although as a 2 % ( w / v ) aqueous solution it does generally impart a consider - ably lower mass - thickness and lower image contrast than uranyl acetate . One slight disadvantage of ammonium molybdate is that specimen storage before TEM study tends to be limited to a few days . Sodium phosphotungstate and sodium silicotungstate are also well - established negative stains and in both cases a ﬁnely grained thin layer of dried stain can be produced , particularly from the silicotungstate salt . Methylamine tungstate has found some favour as a negative stain with plant virologists , but is not currently widelyused . Ontheotherhand , methylaminevanadatehasfounda speciﬁcuseasalowcontrastnegativestain , inparticularforreveal - ing nanogold and undecagold particles bound to macromolecules ( Hainfeld et al . , 1994 ; Jiang et al . , 2007 ) , where other stains would mask the small gold particles . In practice , it is also possible that the use of a 1 % ( w / v ) ( or lower ) aqueous solution of some of the other negativestainingsaltsmaywellachievemuchthesameresult , par - ticularly if trehalose is also included . Indeed , it is likely that almost any metal salt that dries as a non - crystalline amorphous layer will have negative staining properties , as demonstrated by Massover ( 2008b ) and Massover and Marsh ( 1997 ) using sodium tetraborate and other light - atom salts . The incorporation of metal atoms such as gold onto carbohydrates as in aurothioglucose or the use of dis - odium glucose - phosphate ( Massover and Marsh , 2000 ; Massover et al . , 2001 ) , generates a low contrast negative stain , possibly also possessing protective properties due to the carbohydrate , but such compounds have not gained broad usage to - date . The negative staining procedure can generate areas on the carbon - coated specimen grid where the stain layer is too thick , or too thin where the biological material is only partly covered and supported by the stain . The user has to select an optimal stain 120 S . De Carlo , J . Robin Harris / Micron 42 ( 2011 ) 117 – 131 Fig . 1 . Four examples of TEM images produced by conventional negative staining of biomolecular samples adsorbed to a continuous carbon ﬁlm .

All samples were negatively stained with 2 % uranyl acetate . The scale bars indicate 100nm . depth , generally dependent upon some experience with the tech - nique and biological sample , in order to obtain satisfactory images and a meaningful interpretation of the TEM data . The inclusion of trehalose along with the negative stain provides superior coverage ofmoleculesadsorbedtoacarbonﬁlm ( Harrisetal . , 1995 ) , although there is a tendency for the stain layer to be too thick in places . In general , this is not a problem , unless the specimen grid under study contains only one or other extreme of stain depth , which is not usually the case . One approach to overcome this variability of stain depth has been to use a double layer or pleated ﬁlm of carbon with the biological material and negative stain trapped as a sandwich between the two carbon layers . This technique has the advantage of providing an even thickness of negative stain , without producing a pronounced halo of stain around individual particles , but carries with it a considerable risk of particle ﬂattening . Although intro - duced many years ago by a number of researchers , this approach was presented again by Ohi et al . ( 2004 ) , who recommended its use for producing molecular images suitable for subsequent image classiﬁcation , despitethelikelyrestrictedrangeofmolecularorien - tations . A comparison from electron crystallography of unstained frozen - hydrated and negatively stained specimens of photosystem II ( Stoylova et al . , 1998 ) serves to emphasize the overall limitations of negative staining . Four examples of negative staining of biomolecular samples adsorbed to a continuous carbon ﬁlm are given in Fig . 1 . The anthrax PA63 protective antigen ( Fig . 1a ) , ﬁbres produced from the amyloid - beta peptide with bound human erythrocyte catalase molecules ( Fig . 1b ) , cholesterolmicrocrystalsandacochleatecylin - der ( located centrally ) ( Fig . 1c ) and cholesterol microcrystals with bound pyolysin domain 4 ( Fig . 1d ) , are all negatively stained with 2 % uranyl acetate . 2 . 2 . Negative staining - carbon ﬁlm technique This negative staining technique was introduced primarily for the production of 2D arrays and 2D crystals of plant viral parti - cles ( Horne and Pasquali - Ronchetti , 1974 ; Wells et al . , 1981 ) , but has also found considerable use for the production of 2D crystals of protein molecules ( Harris and Holzenburg , 1995 ; Zahn et al . , 1993 ) . The principal features of this technique are as follows . The sample material is allowed to dry on the surface of freshly cleaved mica , in the presence of ammonium molybdate and 0 . 1 or 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) ( Mr 1000 – 10 , 000 ) . Under these condi - tions viral particles or protein molecules are able to form ordered 2D arrays , which form primarily at the air / ﬂuid interface rather than in - solution or attached to the mica ( Harris , 1997 ) . As there is no interaction with or binding to the hydrophilic mica surface , following carbon - coating the carbon - adsorbed 2D protein or viral arrays can released / ﬂoated - off onto the surface of a negative stain solution ( which can be ammonium molybdate , uranyl acetate or other negative stain , or indeed a buffer solution or water for sub - sequent labelling , followed by negative staining ) and transferred to EM grids . This ﬁnal step can be performed in small Petri dishes or in micro - wells in a Teﬂon block , with the EM grids ( blank or coated with a holey - carbon ﬁlm ) being inserted into the nega - tive stain solution beneath the ﬂoating carbon ﬁlm .

Insets show the 2D image average generated from the respective 2D crystals . All samples were negatively stained with 2 % uranyl acetate . The scale bars indicate 100nm . of one of the authors ( JRH ) , many successful molecular applica - tions have been achieved , but it needs to be acknowledged that there is a hydrophobic tendency for the protein 2D arrays / crystals adsorbed to the carbon ﬁlm to be only partly covered by negative stain . This presents a limitation for the production of crystallo - graphic 3D reconstructions unless care is taken to use only images of 2D crystals that are completely embedded in negative stain ( Harris et al . , 1993 ) . Four examples of 2D protein crystals pro - duced by the negative staining - carbon ﬁlm technique are given in Fig . 2 , together with 2D crystallographic projection averages . The molecules depicted are : the proteasome from Thermoplasma aci - dophilum , orientedonside ( Fig . 2a ) ; thekeyholelimpethemocyanin type 1 didecamer , oriented onside ( Fig . 2b ) ; the E . coli chaperone GroEL , oriented on - end , showing the 7 - fold symmetry in the 2D image average ( Fig . 2c ) ; the E . coli chaperone GroEL crystallized in the presence of Mg - ATP ( Fig . 2d ) , with the molecules oriented onsides , exhibiting a markedly different hexagonal 2D crystal . The ability of this technique to generate varying 2D crystal forms from human erythrocyte catalase in exempliﬁed by the studies of Harris and Holzenburg ( 1989 , 1995 ) and Harris et al . ( 1993 ) . However , when equivalent 2D crystals are formed across holes by essentially the same ﬂuid / air interface forces ( see below Section 2 . 3 ) , there is complete embedding within a thin unsupported ﬁlm of negative stain , generally without any molecular distortion due to ﬂattening or adsorption to the carbon ﬁlm ( which can occur in some instances ) . Despite its undoubted possibilities , and even though consid - erable success has been demonstrated using this technique by a number of groups , the negative staining - carbon ﬁlm technique has not gained widespread use in recent years , primarily because of the rehydration step with repeated air - drying of the biolog - ical material , which could induce molecular damage , and the partial - depth coverage with negative stain . The latter problem can be largely overcome by including a low concentration of neutral surfactant , such as 1mM octyl - glucoside , in the negative stain solution to improve the spreading properties ( Harris et al . , 1998 ) . Variants of the initial negative staining - carbon ﬁlm procedure include the production of 3D microcrystals of protein molecules on mica , when PEG alone is used as the crystallizing agent on mica ( Harris et al . , 1992 ) and the fact that carbon - adsorbed sam - ples ﬂoated from the mica surface can subsequently be labelled with suitable probes ( see below ) , together with appropriate wash - ing steps prior to negative staining . Molecules or viral particles in glycerol and a volatile buffer solution can be spread on mica , with removal of the glycerol and buffer in vacuo prior to carbon - coating . Furthermore , if the mica surface is cationized with Alcian blue , intact cells in a protective glycerol solution can be bound , washed , carbon - coated and wet - cleaved prior to negative staining . The upper surface of the cleaved cells remains attached to the car - bon ﬁlm and can be subsequently negatively stained ( Harris , 1991 ) . In general , intact cells are too thick for negative staining ; thus this approach provides the means for the study of plasma membranes , cytomembrane and cytoskeletal components . Fig . 3 presents an example showing carbon - adsorbed cholesterol produced on mica , and subsequently labelled with the cholesterol - binding domain 4 fragmentofpyolysin ( cf . Fig . 1d ) . Antibodyorotherafﬁnitylabelling such as biotin - streptavidin can readily be incorporated within the negative staining - carbon ﬁlm procedure , as with any conventional negative staining protocol . 122 S .

Note the varying lattice angles of the bound pyolysin domain 4 , determined by the under - lying cholesterol crystal . Negatively stained with 2 % uranyl acetate . The scale bar indicates 100nm . 2 . 3 . The holey - carbon negative staining technique A variant negative staining technique has been developed , which enables viruses , macromolecules , ﬁbrils , liposomes and subcellular components to be spread across the holes of holey / perforated carbon support ﬁlms , supported only by a thin ﬁlmofnegativestain + trehalose ( HarrisandSchefﬂer , 2002 ; Harris , 2008 ) . The presence of trehalose ( 0 . 1 – 1 . 0 % , w / v ) is beneﬁcial as it assists the spreading of the negative stain across the holes and maintenance of a thin ﬁlm , while at the same time providing some molecular protection during drying , due to the properties of this disaccharide ( Furuki et al . , 2009 ; Sakurai , 2009 ) . Under these specimen preparation conditions , macromolecules are randomly oriented within the stain - trehalose ﬁlm , thereby generating a com - plete range of projections images , suitable for digital 3D molecular reconstructions . As no orientation restriction is present and owing tothelackofadsorptiontoacarbonsurface , noadsorption - induced molecular deformation is present . Although for macromolecules there is generally no detectable ﬂattening , for some viruses , lipo - somes and fragile vesicular components from cells some ﬂattening may be induced by the interface forces from the two opposing ﬂuid / air biconcave menisci during the drying of the aqueous stain - trehalose ﬁlm , at positions where this becomes exceptionally thin . In practice , prior to drying , vesicular components , large macro - molecules and viruses have a tendency , due to surface tension forces from the two opposing menisci , to diffuse towards to the edge of the holes where the ﬂuid stain - trehalose ﬁlm is thickest . Fig . 4 shows biochemically isolated micronemes from sporozoites of the parasite Cryptosporidium parvum ( Harris et al . , 2003 ) , where there is a pronounced clustering of micronemes within the thicker ﬁlm of negative stain at the edge of a hole ( Fig . 4a ) . At higher magniﬁcation ( Fig . 4b ) it is possible to distinguish damaged from undamaged micronemes ; the latter ( arrowheads ) are not perme - ated by the negative stain . Another example , showing the ∼ 240kDa antioxidant enzyme , peroxiredoxin - 2 , from human erythrocytes is given in Fig . 5 , negatively stained with ammonium molybdate - trehalose spread across a holey - carbon support ﬁlm . Molecular images such as this Fig . 4 . The holey - carbon negative staining technique applied to biochemically iso - lated micronemes from Cryptosporidium parvum sporozoites . ( a ) At the edge of the hole , shown by the dense arc towards the top of the image , there is a pro - nouncedclusteringofmicronemeswithinthethickernegativestain ( see Harrisetal . , 2003 ) ; ( b ) at higher magniﬁcation , the damaged micronemes show internal struc - tural features and can be readily distinguished from the intact smooth - surfaced stain - excluding micronemes ( arrowheads ) .

The scale bars indicate 100nm . can be utilized for medium resolution ( ca 20Å ) negative stain 3D reconstructions , within which is possible to ﬁt for correla - tion purposes a higher resolution X - ray structure , when available ( Harris et al . , 2001 ) . Of the several available examples of ﬁbril - lar material negatively stained when spread across holes ( Harris , 2008 ) , we have selected an image showing DNA tubules formed from biotinylated oligonucleotides , subsequently labelled with a streptavidin - antibody ( scFv ) fusion protein ( Fig . 6a ) . Also shown are ﬁbrils formed by the bacterial peptide Pepstatin A ( Fig . 6b ) , the detail of which can be compared with the amyloid - beta ﬁb - rils imaged by conventional negative staining with uranyl acetate in Fig . 2b . In general , superior image detail is produced from samples spread in stain and trehalose across holes , compared to carbon - adsorbed specimens . Although most work has been per - formed using the 6 % ( w / v ) ammonium molybdate 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) trehalose combination , success has also be achieved using sodium phosphotungstate and sodium silicotungstate solutions containing trehalose , but when the combination of uranyl acetate and tre - halose is used , the thin dry ﬁlm of stain and carbohydrate has been found to be very sensitive to irradiation damage in the electron beam . This holey - carbon negative staining technique has also been extended to include PEG along with the ammonium molybdate and trehalose , in an attempt to induce 2D crystallization of a num - ber of different protein molecules and viruses . Some success has been achieved using this approach with both air - dried samples and also with samples subjected to cryo - negative staining ( see below , Section 3 ) . In both cases there is a strong parallel between the crystal - inducing phenomenon that occurs at the ﬂuid / air inter - face of the holey - carbon specimen grid with sample and stain spread across the holes , and what occurs at the air / ﬂuid interface when essentially similar conditions are applied to samples spread thinly on the surface of freshly cleaved mica at the ﬁrst stage of the negative staining - carbon ﬁlm protocol . It appears that under these conditions protein molecules and viruses have a tendency to migrate to the ﬂuid / air interface , where evaporation can induce an increase in concentration of the particles at the interface ( Cyrklaff et al . , 1994 ) , thereby producing intermolecular or inter - viral inter - actions , leading to 2D array and 2D crystal formation . Fig . 7 shows examples of 2D crystal formation by tomato bushy stunt virus and the octopus hemocyanin decamer . Quite unexpectedly , it has also been found that instead of pro - ducing 2D crystals during negative staining across holes in the presence of ammonium molybdate and PEG , the decameric ery - throcyte peroxiredoxin - 2 has been found to form a higher order dodecahedral macromolecular assembly ( Fig . 8 ) that possesses a marked similarity to enzyme complexes and supramolecular assemblies such as clathrin and viral capsids ( Meissner et al . , 2007 ) . It is likely that other protein molecules , in particular viral pro - teins , could also be experimentally “encouraged” to form larger assemblies under these “in - solution” as well as “air / ﬂuid interface” conditions during specimen preparation , which in turn could lead to bulk preparations in larger volumes of solution , if optimal higher order assembly conditions can be deﬁned . When trehalose is used alone , thin air - dried ﬁlms produced by spreading a 1 % ( w / v ) aqueous solution across holes ( which are remarkably stable in the electron beam ) generate a mass - thickness very close to that of a monolayer of most small protein molecules . Thus , such molecules will not be revealed in the electron beam due to contrast matching . For larger biological particles , such as the relatively thick collagen ﬁbrils , and viruses where the mass - thickness of the nucleic acid - containing core is greater than that of protein , the virions can be revealed . Fig . 9a shows an example of turnip yellow mosaic virus spread across a holey - carbon support ﬁlm in the presence of 1 % trehalose alone ; the slightly higher mass - thickness of the nucloprotein cores is visible whereas the protein shell is essentially contrast matched by the surrounding trehalose . Block copolymer particles often have a mass - thickness somewhat higher than that of protein molecules , and if gold crystallites have been incorporated within the polymer they will be readily revealed ( Fig . 9b ) . Ifthereissomeintegralheavymetalcomponent , suchasis foundwiththeiron - transportproteinfrataxin , thentheparticulate , oftenmicrocrystalline , irondensitieswillberevealed ( Fig . 9candd ) ( see Harris and Schefﬂer , 2002 ) . Indeed , the iron core of the ferritin can be revealed , with iron oxide atomic lattice if studied in a high resolution 200 or 300kV FEG TEM ( Fig . 9e ) . The ∼ 1 . 4nm mono - maleimide Nanogold ® can be deﬁned when embedded within a thin ﬁlm of trehalose ( Fig . 9f ) , and it is likely that spreading in tre - halose alone would be useful for metal - tagged protein molecules ( cf . Nishino et al . , 2007 ) . 2 . 4 . Dynamic negative staining Dynamic structural changes to macromolecules can be induced byavarietyoftreatments , suchatemperature , chemicaltreatments ( e . g . pH , salt and buffer ionic strength , temperature , drugs , enzyme substrates or inhibitors , reduction or oxygenation and toxin inter - action ) and illumination by a particular wavelength of light . Since the early days of electron microscopy it was apparent that exper - imentally induced dynamic structural changes of macromolecules could be assessed from negatively stained specimens ( Simon et al . , 1991 ) . In general the minimum time period for such treatments is thought to be limited by the grid preparation time and drying time of the negative stain on a specimen grid ( e . g . 1 or 2min ) . However , recent investigations by Zhao and Craig ( 2003 , 2008 ) have shown that time - resolved structural changes to myosin ﬁlaments can be 124 S . De Carlo , J .

Thescale bars indicate 100nm . trapped on a millisecond time - scale by the rapid stabilizing inter - action of uranyl acetate ( Fig . 10 ) ; it is likely that other experimental systems could readily utilize this approach . The interaction of the cytolysin from Vibrio cholerae ( VCC ) has been show to interact with the bilayer edges of cholesterol microcrystals at short time periods , and that with increasing time the planar surfaces of the microcrystals become coated with the cytolysin ( Harris et al . , 2002 ) . Similarly , the relatively rapid oligomerization time of the cholesterol - dependent cytolysin pyolysin from Arcanobacterium pyogenes and also attachment of its cholesterol - binding domain 4 fragment ( on a time - scale of minutes ) , hasbeendemonstratedbynegativestaining ( JRH , unpub - lished data ) . Others have also utilized negative staining for the dynamic study of macromolecular structures ( Burgess et al . , 2004 ; Kondo et al . , 1999 ; Willows et al . , 2004 ) . The investigations on 2D crystallization and macromolecular assembly formation , mentioned above , where PEG is included in the ammonium molybdate - trehalose negative staining solution , also require time - dependent TEM studies to assess the progression of intermolecular interaction . This approach can readily by linked to the biochemical and biophysical assessment of such interactions . 3 . Cryo - negative staining : techniques , results and discussion 3 . 1 . Frozen - hydrated specimens in the presence of a saturated ammonium molybdate solution at neutral pH We usually follow the cryo - negative staining protocol of Adrian et al . ( 1998 ) , using lab - made holey - carbon ﬁlms on 200 - mesh cop - pergrids ( Fig . 11 ) . Thebestresultscanbeobtainedafterevaporating a thin layer of Au / Pd on one side of the holey - carbon grid to assist sample spreading , a useful innovation introduced by Marc Adrian .

Brieﬂy , we add 1 . 2 – 1 . 3g of ammonium molydbate tetrahy - drateto0 . 875mlwater , neutralizedtopH7 . 2 – 7 . 4withtheaddition of 0 . 125ml of 10M NaOH at room temperature . This forms a satu - rated slurry that can be stored as such for some time . Immediately before the use we shake the slurry quickly again , let it sediment for a few seconds and take the supernatant as the negative stain - ing solution . At this point we have measured a solution density of 1 . 45 ± 0 . 05g / cm 3 . Finally , 100 (cid:2) l aliquots of this staining solution are deposited on Paraﬁlm and subsequently used for the staining procedure ( De Carlo et al . , 2002 ) . A short evaporation period ( 1 – 3s ) after blotting and before plunge freezing is essential for produc - tion of satisfactory thin ﬁlms of vitriﬁed ammonium molybdate ( Fig . 11 ) . Undertheseconditions , thevitriﬁedspecimensarealmost fully hydrated ( in terms of protein - bound water ) , as the vitriﬁed medium contains a saturated heavy metal salt with approximately 30 % water by volume ( Adrian et al . , 1998 ) . Nevertheless , the results obtained through the past decade and more recently have clearly demonstrated that although not in their fully hydrated state , sam - ples prepared with the Adrian cryo - negative staining technique are well - preserved in a vitreous / frozen - hydrated state . Examples whereadirectside - by - sidecomparisoncanbemadearenowavail - able in the literature , among these are the bacterial chaperonin GroEL ( Fig . 12 ) ( see De Carlo et al . , 2002 , 2008 ) , and several eukary - otic RNA polymerases ( Fig . 13 ) ( see De Carlo et al . , 2003 ; Kostek et al . , 2006 ) . Inothercases , cryo - negativestaininghasrevealedmolec - ular details ( i . e . between 10 and 15Å ) for proteins considered to be too small for cryo - EM , such as the human transcription factor TFIIE , which is a dimeric protein complex of ∼ 110kDa ( Jawhari et al . , 2006 ) . The improved resolution resulting from cryo - negative staining seems to be due to several factors : these may include hydration of the biological particles , suspension in a thin layer of vitreous ice instead of adsorption to a continuous support and the documented increase in signal - to - noise ratio . Partial specimen hydration is an obvious advantage , since it allows the embedded protein to maintain almost complete hydration , thus avoiding ﬁne structural collapse that is likely to occur in the total absence of water . The stain does not dry , thus preventing the formation of a dried cast onto and around the protein , the molybdate anions remain free in the vitreous solution and may rapidly diffuse into the protein globular molecules , allowing the high - resolution ﬁne structure of the protein to be imaged in reversed contrast instead of imag - ing only the surface stain - excluded protein volume , as is the case for air - dry negative staining at room temperature . The key is in the combination of adding solutes to the solution that preserve 126 S . De Carlo , J . Robin Harris / Micron 42 ( 2011 ) 117 – 131 Fig . 9 .

Clearly , imaging only 14 , 000 particles in the vitriﬁed stain allowed the authors to reach about 10Å resolution , as opposed to the hundreds of thousands of unstained GroEL particles necessary to reach sub - nanometer resolution , as demonstrated by several research groups ( Ludtke et al . , 2004 ; Stagg et al . , 2006 ; Ranson et al . , 2006 ) .

( 2006 ) showedthathumanRNApolymerasecould be imaged at ∼ 20Å resolution , fully preserved in the thin vitreous stain layer , allowing the enzyme to be reconstructed in two distinct conformational states . Another advantage of using anionic molybdate over the com - monly used cationic uranyl salts , is that even at saturated concentrations it can be buffered to any desired physiological pH by the addition of a very small volume of strong base , although this comment could also apply to the phosphotugstate / silicotungstate negative staining salts . Cryo - negative staining can readily be performedinasemi - automatedfashioninsideablottingandvitriﬁ - cation device that is fully computer controlled , such as the Vitrobot ( FEI ) or the Cp3 ( Gatan ) .

Blotting is generally applied from one side only , but can be double - sided . Immediately after the blotting stage , a short period of time ( a few seconds ) will enable some evaporation to occur with concentration of the sample and stain , prior to plunge freezing / vitriﬁcation . This procedure can also incorporate PEG and other solutes within the sample prior to freezing which may structurally inﬂuence the biological material under investigation , e . g . by creating 2D crystals . 128 S .

Special precautions may need to be taken if the blotting chamber is used at 100 % relative humidity . In our expe - rience it is better to keep the sample environment relatively dry immediately before blotting . If the sample buffer concentrations need to be maintained at deﬁned humidity values the blotting parameters on the automated vitriﬁcation device will need to be changed accordingly . Since we have also considered 2D crystal formation by proteins and viruses during cryo - negative staining , we would like to dis - cuss here the advantages to be gained by addition of polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) . A few examples of para - crystalline formation for a solution of viruses or proteins are presented in Fig . 14 . Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus ( TBSV ) in the presence of 0 . 1g / L of PEG - 1000 is shown cryo - negatively stained in panel a ) of Fig . 14 , whereas hex - americ hemoglobin from the marine annelid Nereis virens is shown inFig . 14panelb ) . Inourexperience , adding1 – 2 % PEGinducesorder formationinparticulatessuspendedattheair – waterinterface . This may be interpreted as protein – protein interaction becoming domi - nant by decreasing solute – solute repulsion , as observed for protein solutions near their isoelectric point . The combination of ions from the staining solution as well as the presence of PEG may facilitate this condition , inducing pseudo - crystal formation of larger size as compared to the same solutions , but in the total absence of PEG ( see Lorber et al . , 2008 ) . Provided the protein complex under investigation endures well structurally in the staining solution ( this may be cross - checked Fig . 15 .

Our main conclusions obtained so far from cryo - negative stain - ing on biological particulates imaged both in 120kV LaB 6 and a 200kV FEG electron microscope under strict cryo - conditions can be summarized as follows : • The negative staining solution produces a higher signal - to - noise ratio than conventional unstained cryo - EM ( Adrian et al . , 1984 ) . This has several positive effects on 3D structure determination of macromolecular complexes , as further outlined below . • For reaching a certain resolution on a given structure fewer par - ticles have to be collected than with conventional cryo - EM . • Theminimalsizeofparticlesmaybelowerbecausetheyaremore easily visualized and classiﬁed due to the higher contrast . • The defocus values during image recording can be lowered , extending the ﬁrst zero - node of the CTF further out . Unstained GroELishardlydetectableonelectronmicrographsrecordedwith ∼ 1000nm defocus at 200kV while they are well visible in the presence of negative stain . • Our previous study has shown that samples are less beam - sensitive in the presence of stain as shown by the absence of damage despite the three - fold increase in the exposure dose ( see Fig . 1 in De Carlo et al . , 2002 ) . However , a precise quantiﬁcation remains to be done . • The vitriﬁed and stained particles deliver a stronger Thon ring pattern , facilitating image quality control and CTF correction . We have , however , also encountered a few limitations of cryo - negative staining . Most importantly , the structure under study must withstand the exposure to the concentrated ammonium molybdate . Over the last decade , a few biological assemblies stud - ied by cryo - negative staining showed sensitivity to the saturated stain and tended to partially split apart into their smaller subunits ( e . g . KLH , Fig . 15 ) . Among these rare , yet important , unsuccess - ful cases we can cite microtubules , and some multimeric ATPases , such as NtrC ( De Carlo et al . , 2006 ) , which dissociate completely ( data not shown ) . Even in these cases , it is possible that useful information on the dissociation intermediates might be gained , for correlation with other biochemical or biophysical data . The 130 S . De Carlo , J . Robin Harris / Micron 42 ( 2011 ) 117 – 131 other important ﬁnding is that , while the macromolecules that are well - preserved in vitriﬁed saturated ammonium molybdate and their structure is revealed with a good accuracy to about 10Å resolution , internal ﬁne structures are sometimes lost , i . e . the resolution may not be isotropic in the 3D reconstruction . This is either due to insufﬁcient stain penetration at these locations , or the structural detail may be imaged at reverse contrast ( positive contrast as in conventional cryo - EM instead of negative contrast as from cryo - negative staining ) . Alternatively , cryo - negative stain - ing may over - emphasize the contrast of low - resolution features while reproducing high - resolution structures at a far lower con - trast . Hence , the range in contrast from low - to high - resolution structures seems much larger than in conventional cryo - EM . Also , contrast enhancement may not be the same for all spatial frequen - cies , and it is difﬁcult to estimate the real contribution of stain to the amplitude contrast in the CTF , especially at low spatial frequen - cies . Cryo - negative staining represents a complementary method to conventionalcryo - EMofunstainedvitriﬁedsamplesandavaluable alternative , in particular for situations where cryo - EM reaches its limitsintermsofsamplevisibility , orwhereapreliminary3Dmodel isrequiredtoinitiateacryo - EMimageaveragingapproach . Itcanbe useful for cryo - electron tomography of non - symmetric viruses or small particulates . Indeed , the presence of ammonium molybdate helps preserving the samples being imaged with a total cumula - tive electron dose of 80 – 100el . / Å 2 ( Messaoudi et al . , 2003 ) . The presentreviewdemonstratesthatcryo - negativestainingpreserves the structure of biological macromolecules to ﬁne detail ( i . e . 10Å ) .

Conclusions We have discussed in some depth the range of technical possi - bilities available for the production of air - dried negatively stained specimens from macromolecular and viral samples , and have demonstrated within the ﬁgures some achievable electron images from such specimens . Emphasis has been placed upon the bene - ﬁts to be gained from the production of air - dried specimens spread across holes and supported in negative stain alone . As with the mica - spreading “negative staining - carbon ﬁlm” procedure , protein and viral samples dried across holes in the presence of nega - tive stain and PEG have been shown to form two - dimensional crystals , and also generate supramolecular assemblies in some instances ( Meissner et al . , 2007 ) . This air - drying negative staining approach correlates particularly well with cryo - negative staining , where samples are also initially spread across holey - carbon sup - port ﬁlms , blotted and then plunge - frozen . Indeed , it has been our intention to place strongest overall emphasis on the cryo - negative staining procedure ( see Section 3 ) , as this offers the greatest pos - sibilities for future high - resolution molecular studies . Accordingly , a thorough account of the cryo - negative staining procedure and some recent applications has been given . The beneﬁts and limita - tions are discussed , and meaningful comparisons made with the conventional air - dry negative staining and unstained vitriﬁcation procedures . Acknowledgement S .
