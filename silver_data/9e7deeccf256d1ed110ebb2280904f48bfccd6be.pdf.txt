LQTS and epilepsy both belong to the group of ion channelopathies that manifest in the heart and brain . Therefore , genetic analysis of genes associated with potassium and sodium homeostasis and electrical disorders may reveal a link between epilepsy and lethal cardiac arrhythmia . Here , the authors report a young woman who suffered recurrent seizure episodes and syncopes that occurred while walking and also during rest . She showed electroencephalogram abnormalities and a pathological prolonged QTc interval in electrocardiogram . The patient and the patient ’ s asymptomatic family members underwent genetic screening of the three genes most frequently associated with LQTS : KCNQ1 , KCNH2 , and SCN5A . The patient and the family members did not show DNA alterations in the genes KCNQ1 and SCN5A associated with LQT - 1 and LQT - 3 , respectively . However , the patient showed a de novo mutation 2587T → C in exon 10 of KCNH2 gene associated with LQT - 2 . The mutation caused a stop codon substitution ( R863X ) in the HERG channel , leading to a 296 – amino acid deletion . The patient ’ s asymptomatic relatives did not show the KCNH2 gene mutation . R863X alteration in HERG channel may be involved in both prolonged QTc interval and epilepsy . This fact raises the possibility that R863X alteration in KCNH2 - encoded potassium channel may confer susceptibility for epilepsy and cardiac LQT - 2 arrhythmia . Keywords : epilepsy , KCNH2 gene , long QT syndrome , mutation INTRODUCTION Long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) is a hereditary cardiac dis - ease characterized by prolongation of the QT interval in the electrocardiogram due to prolonged ventricular repo - larization , leading to syncope and sudden cardiac death ( Moss et al . , 1991 ) . Clinical presentation of LQTS shows heterogeneous variability ( Crotti et al . , 2008 ) . Indeed , nu - merous genotype - speciﬁ c LQTS have been identiﬁ ed . The three most frequent LQTS genotypes are ( LQT - 1 , LQT - 2 , and LQT - 3 ) . These LQTS genotypes have been associated with DNA alterations in three different genes : KCNQ1 , KCNH2 , and SCN5A , respectively ( Hedley et al . , 2009 ) . Epilepsy is a neurological disorder , caused by abnor - mal neuronal discharges and characterized by recurrent convulsions and seizures ( Commission on Epidemiology and Prognosis , 1993 ) . It is common that LQTS patients be misdiagnosed with epilepsy and treated with antiepi - leptic drugs ( Horn et al . , 1986 ) . Indeed , a clinical seizure phenotype has been found in up to one - third of genotyped LQTS patients , suggesting relationship between LQTS and neuronal hyperexcitability ( Johnson et al . , 2009 ) . It is noteworthy that two different knock - in transgenic mouse models with human LQT - 1 mutations produced both epilepsy and cardiac phenotypes ( Goldman et al . , 2009 ) . The KvLQT1 delayed rectiﬁ er channel , associated with LQT - 1 , was localized in both the heart and brain ( Goldman et al . , 2009 ) . However , other genes encoding ionic channels have been also postulated to be involved in both epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia . Johnson et al . showed that epilepsy diagnosis and treatment with anti - epileptic drug medication was more common in patients with LQT - 2 , suggesting that the KCNH2 - encoded potas - sium channel may be a link between epilepsy and cardiac Received 4 November 2011 ; accepted 8 March 2012 .

KCNH2 Mutation and Electrical Disorders 383 arrhythmia ( Johnson et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , mouse models with mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor 2 gene ( RYR2 ) have shown seizure and death following exercise ( Lehnart et al . , 2008 ) . Knockout mice for the human epilepsy gene , KCNA1 , also have seizures and cardiac arrhytmias ( Glasscock et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , a retrospective study of sudden unexpected death in epilep - sy patients has also demonstrated known LQTs variants in these patients ( Tu et al . , 2011a ) . Most recently , mutations in hyperpolarization - activated cyclic nucleotide - gated ( HCN ) pace - making channels have been associated with predisposition of epilepsy patients to seizures , cardiac ar - rhythmia , and sudden death ( Tu et al . , 2011b ) . The present study reports a Spanish patient showing symptoms related to both epilepsy and LQT - 2 diagnoses , which were associated with a de novo mutation in exon 10 of KCNH2 gene . MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical Evaluation The family study comprised ﬁ ve members in three genera - tions ( Figure 1 ) . Patient was a 22 - year - old woman , who frequently presented to the Emergency Unit of Hospital Ourense in Spain , due to seizure episodes and syncopes . In order to analyze neurological origins , the patient was sub - jected to an exhaustive physical and clinical examination , including electroencephalogram ( EEG ) . After additional episode of seizure and syncope convulsion , a 12 - lead elec - trocardiography ( ECG ) was also done . QT intervals were measured in the ECG and it was deﬁ ned as pathologi - cal according to Priori et al . ( QTc (cid:2) 460 ms for females and (cid:2) 440 ms for males ) ( Priori et al . , 1999 ) . The patient ’ s family members did not report symptoms , although they were also subjected to EEG and ECG studies . Genetic Analysis After written informed consent , blood samples were ob - tained from all the studied subjects . Genomic DNA was extracted from subjects ’ white blood cells as previously reported ( Zamorano - Le ó n et al . , 2010 ) . Proband under - went genetic screening of the three genes most frequently associated with LQTS : KCNQ1 , KCNH2 , and SCN5A . Exons and short intronic ﬂ anking regions of these genes were ampliﬁ ed by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . PCR products were puriﬁ ed using a commercial kit Figure 1 .

RESULTS Clinical Findings The proband ( IIIa ) , a 22 - year - old woman , showed a clini - cal history of recurrent seizure episodes with convulsions and body stiffness . There were no knowledge of other cases of seizure episodes in her family . At 15 years old , the patient developed the ﬁ rst clinical manifestation : a seizure episode when she was walking . By 2007 , she had suffered more than 6 seizure episodes with convulsions in different situations such as walking , and even at rest ; however , she never suffered effort - syncope . Electroen - cephalogram study showed epileptiform activity in the left temporal area . The standard EEG revealed high volt - age polyspikes , 14 - Hz spikes , and wave discharges with positive polarity localized in the left temporal - rolendic area . Electroencephalographic evidences and recurrent seizure episodes led to epilepsy as the ﬁ rst diagnosis . She was being treated with antiepileptic drugs . However , the patient suffered new seizure and convulsion episodes . Therefore , the patient was subjected to cardiac stress test and electrocardiographic study . During the cardiac stress test , she did not display abnormalities , although electro - cardiograms immediately after new postsyncope showed pathological QTc intervals of 485 , 499 , and 565 ms ( see Figure 1 ) . She was also diagnosed with LQTS and then treated with beta blockers ( atenolol 50 mg / day ) in addi - tion to antiepileptic drugs ( lamotrigine 200 mg / day ) . The patient has not suffered new seizure episodes from the use of combined therapy , remaining asymptomatic . However , prolonged QT interval in ECG has not been corrected with combined therapy . The patient ’ s asymptomatic family members did not show neurological disorders and electrocardiographic ab - normalities . Genetic Analysis Genetic screening demonstrated absence of mutations in the KCNQ1 and SCN5A genes in either proband or family members . However , the sequencing analysis of KCNH2 gene in the proband revealed a heterozygous single - nucleotide substitution 2587T → C in exon 10 of the KCNH2 gene , which creates a stop codon substituting for arginine at position 863 ( R863X ) in the HERG protein ( Figure 1 ) . This stop codon leads a 296 – amino acid dele - tion in HERG protein ( Figure 1 ) . The 2587T → C KCNH2 mutation was not observed in the patient ’ s parents and relatives ( Figure 1 ) . Interestingly , the region surrounding the R863X alteration was identiﬁ ed as highly conserved between different species ( Figure 1 ) . Genetic screening on the proband and family mem - bers showed the presence of several common polymor - phisms in KCNQ1 and SCN5A genes ( Table 1 ) . These polymorphisms have not been associated with changes in the amino acid sequence of each corresponding encoded channel except for H558R in NaV 1 . 5 channel ( Table 1 ) . H558R polymorphism has been reported with high frequency ( 1 : 5 people ( Yang et al . , 2002 ) and seems to mitigate the gating defect caused by a nearby mutation ( T512I ) in the gene encoding SCN5A ( Viswanathan et al . , 2003 ) .

KCNH2 Mutation and Electrical Disorders 385 interval . Genetic study revealed a de novo mutation ( R863X ) in exon 10 of the KCNH2 gene . At present , there is controversy about the differential diagnosis between epilepsy and LQTS ( Yamamoto et al . , 2009 ) . LQTS shows greater heterogeneity in clinical man - ifestations , including seizures episodes and , therefore , it may be initially misdiagnosed as epilepsy ( MacCormick et al . , 2009 ) . Indeed , delayed diagnosis of long QT syn - drome is frequent , as initially also occurred in the present patient . Since 2587T → C KCNH2 mutation was not present in the asymptomatic parents and relatives of the patient , it may suggest that R863X mutation in HERG could be associated with development of both epilepsy and LQTS disorders . At present , to our knowledge , this mutation has not been previously associated with epilepsy . However , R863X mutation was previously reported associated with LQTS type 2 ( Van Langen et al . , 2003 ; Teng et al . , 2004 ) . 2587T → C KCNH2 mutation is located just downstream of a conserved region between different species , and produce a 296 – amino acid deletion ( residues 863 – 1159 ) in the HERG C - terminus ( Teng et al . , 2004 ) . In vitro , functional studies have demonstrated that R863X HERG reduced HERG channels density , since R863X HERG cannot be translocated onto cell plasma membrane ( Teng et al . , 2004 ) . It should be noted that both LQTS and epilepsy are associated with abnormal ionic channel function ( Hedley et al . , 2009 ; Reid et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore , it is plausible that both pathologies may partially overlap . There are previous evidences suggesting ion channel encoding gene alterations in patients and animal models with epilepsy and sudden unexpected death . As examples , alterations in KCNQ1 and KCNA1 genes have been demonstrated to be the cause of epilepsy and sudden unexplained death in transgenic models ( Goldman et al . , 2009 ; Glasscock et al . , 2010 ) . SCN5A may also be associated with sudden unexplained death epilepsy , as reported in a single human case ( Aurlien et al . , 2009 ) . It is noteworthy that HERG channels have been described in glial cells and the block - age of potassium homeostasis in glial cells may promote epilepsy ( Emmi et al . , 2000 ) . Therefore , it is plausible that R863X mutation in KCNH2 gene may be involved in both neurological and prolonged QT interval - related disorders . In summary , we have reported that de novo R863X KCNH2 mutation was associated with the presence of prolonged QTc interval and epilepsy in a young Span - ish woman . This ﬁ nding suggests that alterations in the HERG channel may promote cardiac and neuronal dis - orders , revealing a close relationship between epilepsy and long QT type 2 syndrome . The erg channel was ﬁ rstly described from Drosophila seizure ( Warmke & Ganetzky , 1994 ; Trudeau et al . , 1995 ; Titus et al . , 1997 ) and new DNA alterations related to human ERG - encoded gene are being to be described with different implications in both heart - and brain - related diseases . Therefore , genetic stud - ies may be useful to elucidate the link between cardiac and neuronal channelopathies .
