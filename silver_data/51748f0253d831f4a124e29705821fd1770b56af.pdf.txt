Ring polymers , in particular , have been the topic of much debate due to the inability of the celebrated reptation model to capture their observed dynamics . Macrorheology and differential dynamic microscopy ( DDM ) are powerful methods to determine entangled polymer dynamics across scales , yet they typically require different samples under different conditions , preventing direct coupling of bulk rheological properties to the underlying macromolecular dynamics . Here , we perform macrorheology on composites of highly - overlapping DNA and dextran polymers , focusing on the role of DNA topology ( rings versus linear chains ) as well as the relative volume fractions of DNA and dextran . On the same samples under the same conditions , we perform DDM and single - molecule tracking on embedded fluorescent - labeled DNA molecules immediately before and after bulk measurements . We show DNA - dextran composites exhibit unexpected non - monotonic dependences of bulk viscoelasticity and molecular - level transport properties on the fraction of DNA comprising the composites , with characteristics that are strongly dependent on the DNA topology . We rationalize our results as arising from stretching and bundling of linear DNA versus compaction , swelling , and threading of rings driven by dextran - mediated depletion interactions . 1 . Introduction Ring polymers have been the topic of fervent investigation for decades due to their intriguing rheological and dynamical properties , biological significance , and industrial applications . For example , DNA naturally occurs in ring formation , and conversion between supercoiled and open circular ( ring ) topology plays a critical role in DNA replication and repair [ 1 - 3 ] . Further , ring polymers can tune the rheological properties of polymeric blends for commercial and industrial use [ 4 - 6 ] . While the dynamics of entangled linear polymers are well described by the reptation model developed by de Gennes and Doi and Edwards [ 7 , 8 ] , its extension to ring polymers is not straightforward due to their lack of free ends [ 9 - 11 ] . The extent to which ring polymers form entanglements and corresponding entanglement plateaus , the effect and persistence of threading of one polymer by another , and the relaxation modes available to ring polymers remain topics of debate [ 12 - 17 ] . 2 While previous rheological studies have shown that entangled ring polymers do not display entanglement plateaus that their linear counterparts do , [ 12 , 13 , 18 - 20 ] indicating weaker entanglements , other studies have shown that rings undergo very slow relaxation compared to entangled linear chains , such that the final scaling of the storage and loss moduli in the terminal flow regime , 𝐺 ′ ( 𝜔 ) ~ 𝜔 2 and 𝐺 " ( 𝜔 ) ~ 𝜔 1 , is not reached [ 12 , 17 , 21 - 24 ] . Entangled rings are predicted to adopt double - folded or amoeba - like branched structures that undergo modified reptation that is faster than their linear counterparts [ 9 , 25 - 28 ] . At the same time , the reported slow relaxation has been attributed to ring - ring threading , which has been predicted to lead to glassy dynamics from kinetically arrested states that exhibit heterogeneous transport [ 29 , 30 ] . Because nearly all synthesis techniques used to produce solutions and melts of ring polymers result in a small percentage of linear polymer ‘contaminants’ , threading of rings by linear contaminants likely also contribute to the reported slow relaxation of nominally ‘pure’ entangled rings [ 31 ] . The dominant relaxation mode of rings threaded by linear chains is constraint release , whereby a polymer relaxes stress by the threaded polymer unthreading itself and releasing its constraint [ 14 , 22 , 31 ] , rather than the faster mode of reptation that otherwise dominates entangled polymer systems [ 8 , 27 ] . The different rheological properties of entangled rings and linear polymers also manifests in the frequency dependence of the shear viscosity 𝜂 ( 𝜔 ) ~ 𝜔 −𝛾 , an indicator of entanglements and how well polymers are able to align with shear flow . Highly entangled flexible linear polymer melts exhibit shear thinning 𝜂 ( 𝜔 ) ~ 𝜔 −𝛾 with 𝛾 ≈ 0 . 9 - 1 [ 8 , 20 ] , whereas entangled linear DNA solutions in good solvent conditions exhibit slightly reduced thinning with 𝛾 ≈ 0 . 6 – 0 . 9 [ 16 , 32 , 33 ] . Entangled ring melts and solutions have been reported to exhibit weaker shear thinning than their linear counterparts ( 𝛾 ≈ 0 . 4 – 0 . 6 ) owing to their reduced ability to conformationally align with shear flow [ 16 , 20 ] . In ring - linear blends , threading of rings by linear chains have been shown to have profound effects on the rheology and dynamics [ 12 , 21 , 22 , 31 , 34 - 36 ] , including emergent entanglement plateaus , increased zero - shear viscosity and shear - thinning , suppressed relaxation , and hindered diffusion as compared to monodisperse systems of linear chains or rings [ 16 , 36 - 40 ] . For example , previous studies have shown that a small fraction of linear chains ( > 0 . 05 ) can cause entangled ring melts to transition from power - law stress relaxation [ 21 , 41 ] to exhibiting entanglement plateaus comparable to their linear counterparts [ 19 ] . At the same time , a small fraction of rings ( up to ~ 0 . 3 ) added to entangled linear polymer melts has been shown to increase the viscosity up to ~ 2 - fold [ 14 , 22 ] . Further , recent simulations have shown that rings in a melt of very short linear polymers ( up to ~ 10 - fold shorter than the rings ) exhibit more swollen conformations , due to excess chain - end free volume effects , and diffuse faster than in their own melt [ 40 ] . However , when the length of the surrounding linear chains exceeds the entanglement length , ring diffusion drops substantially and swelling is reduced . Finally , the addition of linear chains to entangled rings increases the shear thinning exponent to be comparable to or larger than that for entangled linear polymers with 3 reported values of 𝛾 ≈ 0 . 7 – 0 . 9 [ 16 , 19 ] , suggesting that threading aids in stretching and aligning rings along the flow direction . While the role of polymer topology in entangled melts , solutions and blends continues to be widely investigated , how topology modulates the rheology and dynamics of composites of two distinct polymeric species with different sizes , stiffnesses and structures remains scarcely explored [ 42 ] . Free energy minimization of composites , typically comprising a polymer matrix and a ‘filler’ species , leads to emergent behavior , such as non - monotonic dependence of viscoelastic and transport properties on the relative fraction of each species [ 43 - 47 ] . Emergent phenomena in composites can arise from entropically - driven polymer bundling and flocculation [ 42 , 46 , 48 ] , enhanced miscibility and solubility [ 42 , 47 , 49 , 50 ] , or even liquid - liquid phase separation [ 51 , 52 ] . For example , we previously showed that composites of flexible DNA and ~ 200 - fold stiffer actin filaments exhibit enhanced stiffening and suppressed relaxation compared to networks of DNA or actin alone due to small - scale actin bundling , driven by DNA , that stiffens and strengthens the composite [ 46 ] . This phenomenon arises from depletion interactions , ubiquitous in biology , in which macromolecules of one species ( actin ) are driven together to maximize the available volume ( and thus entropy ) of the other smaller , faster and / or more abundant species ( DNA ) . The unexpected non - monotonic dependence of composite stiffening on the actin fraction is a result of competition between actin bundling , which stiffens the actin network and suppresses thermal fluctuations , and actin network connectivity required to provide a percolated scaffold to support and entangle with the DNA . Similar non - monotonic emergence has been reported in crosslinked composites of cytoskeleton filaments [ 43 , 47 , 53 ] . Another recent study investigating the role of short chain additives to composites of long polymers and nanoparticles ( NPs ) reported a non - monotonic dependence of composite strength on the ratio of short and long polymer chains in polymer nanocomposites [ 54 ] . The peak in mechanical strength , which occurs at ~ 40 % short chains , is attributed to an interplay between short chain adsorption on NPs – which induces stretching and swelling of the long chains and an associated increase in their overlap density – and reduced polymer entanglements and NP connectivity as the number of long NP - bridging polymers is reduced . The interplay between enhanced polymer self - association and network connectivity is similar in spirit to that reported in other composite systems [ 42 , 46 , 55 ] . Similar to Ref [ 54 ] , we previously found stretching of tracer linear DNA from random coils to elongated snake - like conformations , when crowded by small dextran polymers at sufficient dextran volume fraction ( ~ 30 % , 11 𝑐 ∗ ) [ 56 ] . Conversely , ring DNA condensed into more compact spherical conformations under the same conditions . Both elongation and compaction are volume - minimizing conformations , driven by entropy maximization of the dextran crowders ( i . e . , the depletion interaction ) . The complex and intriguing effects of polymer end - closure on rheology and macromolecular dynamics [ 10 , 18 , 20 , 57 ] , combined with the rich emergent phenomena that polymer composites 4 exhibit [ 44 , 55 , 58 - 60 ] , motivated us to examine the molecular - level transport and bulk rheological properties of composites of DNA and dextran – focusing on the role of DNA end - closure ( Fig 1 ) . Fig 1 . Experimental platform to investigate bulk rheology and molecular - level dynamics in composites of DNA and dextran . ( A ) Cartoon of macromolecules that comprise the composites , with their corresponding radius of gyration 𝑅 𝐺 listed : 25 - kbp linear DNA ( blue ) , 25 - kbp ring DNA ( green ) and 500 kDa dextran ( red ) . The panel on the right depicts 11 𝑐 ∗ composites of linear DNA and dextran at all DNA volume fractions 𝜙 that we investigate : 𝜙 = 0 ( 100 % dextran ) , 𝜙 = 0 . 25 ( 25 % DNA , 75 % dextran ) , 𝜙 = 0 . 50 ( 50 % DNA , 50 % dextran ) , 𝜙 = 0 . 75 ( 75 % DNA , 25 % dextran ) , and 𝜙 = 1 ( 100 % DNA ) . ( B ) Lengthscales and timescales probed by the different techniques we use : bulk rheology , differential dynamic microscopy ( DDM ) , and molecular - tracking . ( C ) We use a DHR3 rheometer to measure bulk viscoelastic properties of composites , including the elastic and viscous moduli 𝐺′ ( 𝜔 ) ( filled symbols ) and 𝐺 " ( 𝜔 ) ( open symbols ) . ( D ) Immediately before and after bulk rheology measurements , we capture time - series of labeled DNA molecules diffusing in the sample using the fluorescence microscopy capabilities of the rheometer . We perform DDM analysis on captured time - series to determine the image structure function 𝐷 ( 𝑞 , Δ𝑡 ) as a function of lag time , Δ𝑡 , and wavevector , 𝑞 . By fitting 𝐷 ( 𝑞 , Δ𝑡 ) , we determine the density fluctuation decay times 𝜏 as a function of 𝑞 to describe the DNA dynamics . Data shown in ( C ) and ( D ) is for linear DNA at 𝜙 = 1 . 5 Our work elucidates the effect of DNA topology ( ring versus linear ) and relative fraction of DNA and dextran on the dynamics of DNA - dextran composites from the scale of single polymers ( ~ 10 2 nm ) to that of the macroscopic bulk ( ~ cm ) . Specifically , we couple macrorheology with fluorescence microscopy , differential dynamic microscopy ( DDM ) and single - molecule tracking to directly connect the bulk rheological properties of the composites to the microscale transport properties of the comprising DNA . While both macro - and micro - rheological techniques have been extensively used to investigate entangled polymers and other soft materials , these distinct measurements are typically performed on different samples with different preparation methods , chamber geometries , and sample volumes [ 61 , 62 ] . As such , direct connection between the properties at these two scales is non - trivial [ 33 , 63 - 65 ] . We overcome these limitations by performing imaging and rheology measurements in the same sample using a rheometer with high - speed fluorescence imaging capabilities . Further , we track DNA molecules comprising the composites , rather than embedded probes ( as is typically done in microrheology experiments [ 66 ] ) , to directly report macromolecular dynamics via DDM . Our results reveal a surprising non - monotonic dependence of the rheological properties on the fraction of DNA comprising the composites , with 75 % - 25 % DNA - dextran composites exhibiting uniquely suppressed dissipation coupled with prolonged relaxation times and subdiffusion . We argue that this emergent behavior , that is strongly dependent on DNA topology , arises from entropically - driven self - association and stretching of linear DNA versus swelling and threading of ring DNA . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 DNA : We prepare solutions of double - stranded DNA , 25 kbp in length , via replication of fosmid constructs in Escherichia coli followed by extraction , purification and concentrating as described previously [ 67 - 69 ] . Briefly , to replicate DNA , E . coli cultures containing the fosmid clone is grown from frozen glycerol stocks . To extract the DNA , cells are lysed via treatment with an alkaline solution . The extracted DNA is then renatured via treatment with an acidic detergent , precipitated in isopropanol , washed with 70 % ethanol , and resuspended in TE10 buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 10 mM NaCl ) . To purify the DNA , the solution is treated with Rnase A ( to remove contaminating RNA ) followed by phenol - chloroform extraction and dialysis ( to remove proteins ) . We assess purity using UV absorbance and gel electrophoresis [ 68 ] . The purified DNA solution has a 260 / 280 absorbance ratio of ~ 1 . 8 , in the accepted range for pure DNA with minimal protein contaminants [ 70 ] , and no detectable RNA ( which manifests as a low MW smear on a gel ) ( Fig S1 ) . We use gel electrophoresis to determine a concentration of 3 . 25 mg / mL of our purified solution , consisting of ~ 90 % relaxed circular ( ring ) and ~ 10 % linear DNA ( Fig S1 ) . Gel analysis is performed using Life Technologies E - Gel Imager and Gel Quant Express software ( Fig S1 ) . We convert half of the purified stock DNA solution to linear topology via treatment with the restriction 6 enzyme ApaI ( New England Biolabs ) . We confirm complete conversion to linear topology via gel electrophoresis ( Fig S1 ) . The radii of gyration for the ring and linear DNA are 𝑅 𝐺 , 𝑅 ≃ 280 nm and 𝑅 𝐺 , 𝐿 ≃ 450 nm , respectively [ 69 ] . We compute polymer overlap concentrations for the linear and 90 % ring DNA solutions via 𝑐 ∗ = ( 3 4𝜋⁄ ) ( 𝑀 / 𝑁 𝐴 ) / ( 𝑓 𝐿 𝑅 𝐺 , 𝐿 3 + ( 1 − 𝑓 𝐿 ) 𝑅 𝐺 , 𝑅 3 ) where 𝑀 the molecular weight and 𝑓 𝐿 is the fraction of linear DNA in the sample ( 𝑓 𝐿 = 1 and 0 . 1 for linear and ring solutions , respectively ) [ 8 , 71 ] , resulting in 𝑐 0 . 9𝑅 ∗ ≃ 220  g / mL and 𝑐 𝐿∗ ≃ 71  g / mL for ring and linear DNA , respectively . To image DNA for DDM and particle - tracking , we fluorescent - label a fraction of the DNA molecules with MFP488 ( Mirus ) using the manufacturer - supplied Label IT Labeling Kit and corresponding protocols ( Mirus ) . The excitation / emission spectrum for MFP488 is 501 / 523 nm and the dye molecule to DNA base pair ratio is 5 : 1 . 2 . 2 Dextran : We use molecular biology grade dextran ( Fisher BioReagents BP1580100 , Lot # 196289 ) , with molecular weight 500 kDa and 𝑅 𝐺 ≃ 19 nm [ 72 ] . The manufacturer - provided certificate of analysis shows suitability for protein fractionation and gel permeation chromatography , with heavy metal impurities and ignition residues below industry standards for molecular biology grade purity . To prepare composites , dextran is dissolved in TE10 buffer at a concentration of 28 . 9 mg / ml ( 11 𝑐 ∗ ) and homogenized via slow rotation at room temperature for > 24 hrs . In the present study , as well as our previous studies investigating the diffusion of tracer DNA in crowded dextran solutions [ 56 ] , we see no signs of adsorption or other non - steric interactions between dextran and DNA . 2 . 3 Sample Preparation : We prepare each sample at a volume of 350  L comprising different volume fractions of DNA and dextran solutions each at 11 𝑐 ∗ , corresponding to 2 . 42 , 0 . 78 and 28 . 9 mg / ml for ring DNA , linear DNA and dextran , respectively . We add 2  L of labeled ring or linear DNA tracers to each sample for microscopy measurements . Each sample is prepared at least 4 days prior to experiments and rotated at 4 o C to mix and equilibrate . An oxygen scavenging system ( 45 µg / mL glucose , 43 µg / mL glucose oxidase , 7 µg / mL catalase , 5 µg / mL β - mercaptoethanol ) is added to inhibit photobleaching . Composites comprising both DNA and dextran are prepared by mixing varying volume fractions of 11 𝑐 ∗ DNA and dextran solutions , which we quantify by the volume fraction of the DNA solution 𝜙 . We investigate samples with 𝜙 = 0 ( 0 % DNA , 100 % dextran ) 𝜙 = 0 . 25 ( 25 % DNA , 75 % dextran ) , 𝜙 = 0 . 5 ( 50 % DNA , 50 % dextran ) , 𝜙 = 0 . 75 ( 75 % DNA , 25 % dextran ) , and 𝜙 = 1 ( 100 % DNA , 0 % dextran ) . For each 𝜙 , we prepare samples with ring DNA and linear DNA . 2 . 4 Rheometry : We use a Discovery Hybrid Rheometer 3 ( DHR3 , TA Instruments ) with a 1 o steel cone geometry to perform bulk rheology measurements . We use a glass slide as the bottom plate to enable imaging of fluorescent - labeled DNA in the samples . To prevent evaporation during the experimental cycle we apply mineral oil around the geometry and the sample . To measure linear viscoelastic moduli , 𝐺′ ( 𝜔 ) and 𝐺′ ( 𝜔 ) , we perform two identical frequency sweeps from 𝜔 = 0 . 001 to 100 rad / s at 5 % strain ( well within the linear regime as determined by amplitude sweeps ) . Each 7 frequency sweep lasts ~ 6 . 5 hours with individual frequency measurements spaced 30 mins apart . All data shown is above the measurable torque minimum of 0 . 5 nN·m for the DHR3 rheometer . 2 . 5 Fluorescence Microscopy : The DHR3 is outfitted with a Modular Microscope Accessory ( TA Instruments ) with a 40× 0 . 6 NA objective ( Nikon ) , blue - light LED source , 490 / 525 nm excitation / emission filters , and a Hamamatsu ORCA - Flash 2 . 8 CMOS camera to enable imaging of MPF488 - labeled DNA in the blends . Immediately before and after each bulk rheology measurement , we collect three 512×512 pixel videos of 2000 frames at 1 fps . Sample frames from before and after videos are shown in Fig S2 . 2 . 6 Differential Dynamic Microscopy ( DDM ) : For DDM analysis ( Fig 3 ) , we split the videos into 256×256 pixel regions of interest ( ROIs ) which we analyze separately . We use custom - written scripts ( Python ) to perform DDM . For standard DDM analysis , one takes two - dimensional Fourier transforms of differences between images separated by a range of lag times ∆𝑡 in order to quantify how the degree of correlation decays with lag time as a function of the wave vector 𝑞 . Because this standard correlation function is sensitive to global drift of the sample , we use a slightly modified correlation function referred to as the far - field DDM ( FF - DDM ) function . Previous work has shown that by using FF - DDM , the DDM correlation function , 𝐷 ( 𝑞 , ∆𝑡 ) , is less sensitive to drift [ 73 , 74 ] . As with standard DDM analysis , we fit the far - field DDM matrix to 𝐷 ( 𝑞 , ∆𝑡 ) = 𝐴 ( 𝑞 ) [ 1 − 𝑓 ( 𝑞 , ∆𝑡 ) ] + 𝐵 ( 𝑞 ) , where 𝑓 ( 𝑞 , ∆𝑡 ) is the intermediate scattering function ( ISF ) , 𝐴 ( 𝑞 ) is the amplitude , and 𝐵 ( 𝑞 ) is the background . To determine the type of motion and the corresponding rate , we model the ISF as a stretched exponential : 𝑓 ( 𝑞 , ∆𝑡 ) = 𝑒 − ( ∆𝑡 𝜏 ( 𝑞 ) ) ⁄ 𝛾 where 𝜏 ( 𝑞 ) is the decay time and 𝛾 the stretching exponent . The use of a stretched exponential as opposed to a simple exponential has been shown to better fit dynamics in confined or entangled systems [ 75 , 76 ] . Scaling of 𝜏 ( 𝑞 ) ~ 𝑞 −2 is indicative of normal Brownian diffusion ( i . e . , 𝑀𝑆𝐷 ~ 𝑡 ) , whereas a decay time that depends less strongly on 𝑞 has been associated with more arrested or confined motion [ 77 , 78 ] . Error bars shown in Fig 3 are standard error across all ROIs and videos , representing sample - to - sample variation . Example ISFs and fits are shown in Fig S4 and sample - to - sample variation in the ISFs is shown in Fig S5 . Estimates of diffusion coefficients 𝐷 and their errors are based on the fits to 𝜏 ( 𝑞 ) = 1 / 𝐷𝑞 2 over the range of 𝑞 from 0 . 39 µm - 1 to 2 . 44 µm - 1 . For some samples , particularly for 𝜙 = 0 . 75 composites , we observe a 𝑞 - dependence that indicates nearly arrested rather than diffusive dynamics [ 78 ] . While we still compute an effective diffusion coefficient for these samples , because the dynamics differ from normal diffusive transport , we also fit each curve to 𝜏 ( 𝑞 ) = 1 / 𝐾𝑞 𝛼 where 𝛼 is a free parameter that is ~ 2 for normal diffusion and approaches zero for halted or arrested dynamics . 𝐾 is the generalized transport coefficient that is equivalent to 𝐷 when 𝛼 = 2 . 2 . 7 Single - molecule tracking : For single - molecule tracking experiments , we image the MFP488 - labeled DNA using an Olympus IX73 inverted fluorescence microscope with a 60× 1 . 2 NA oil immersion objective ( Olympus ) . We collect five 512×512 pixel videos of 2000 frames at 10 fps for each sample . We use custom particle - tracking scripts ( Python ) to track the center - of - mass of individual DNA molecules and measure their frame - to - frame 𝑥 and 𝑦 displacements ( ∆𝑥 , ∆𝑦 ) from 8 which we compute the ensemble averaged mean - squared displacements ( < ∆𝑥 2 > , < ∆𝑦 2 > ) . We fit the average of < ∆𝑥 2 > and < ∆𝑦 2 > ( i . e . , 𝑀𝑆𝐷 ) versus lag time ∆𝑡 to a power - law function 𝑀𝑆𝐷 〜 ∆𝑡 𝛽 where 𝛽 is the subdiffusive scaling exponent . For a system exhibiting normal diffusion , 𝛽 = 1 , while 𝛽 < 1 indicates anomalous subdiffusion . Error bars listed in Fig 4 are based on fits of the data to 𝑀𝑆𝐷 〜 ∆𝑡 𝛽 . 3 . Results and Discussion 3 . 1 System Details In all of our experiments described below , we fix the total polymer concentration to 11 𝑐 ∗ to ensure that the molecules are highly overlapping , and we vary the volume fractions of the 11 𝑐 ∗ solutions of the different polymers ( ring DNA , linear DNA and dextran ) . By fixing the degree to which molecules overlap , we can unambiguously determine the effect of polymer topology ( i . e . , ring versus linear DNA ) , as well as steric and entropic interactions between distinct polymers ( i . e . , DNA and dextran ) , on the rheological properties and macromolecular dynamics . Specifically , we examine DNA - dextran blends with either purely linear DNA or 90 % - 10 % ring - linear DNA ( which we refer to as ‘ring’ throughout the paper for simplicity ) at DNA volume fractions of 𝜙 = 0 ( pure dextran solution ) , 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 75 and 1 ( pure DNA solution ) . 3 . 2 Bulk linear rheology of DNA - dextran composites We first examine the bulk linear viscoelastic properties of DNA - dextran composites . Fig 2A compares the elastic modulus 𝐺′ ( 𝜔 ) and viscous modulus 𝐺 " ( 𝜔 ) for composites with linear DNA ( left plot ) and ring DNA ( right plot ) DNA . Pure dextran solutions ( not shown ) exhibit Newtonian properties with 𝐺 " ~ 𝜔 1 scaling over the entire frequency range . Linear DNA solutions without dextran ( 𝜙 = 1 ) show a transition from the terminal flow regime at low frequencies , with approximate scaling of 𝐺 " ~ 𝜔 1 and 𝐺′ ~ 𝜔 2 , to a rubbery plateau at high frequencies with a crossover frequency , at which 𝐺′ exceeds 𝐺 " , of 𝜔 𝐷 ≈ 0 . 25 rad / s . This crossover frequency is a measure of the disengagement time , 𝜏 𝐷 ≈ 2𝜋 / 𝜔 𝐷 ≈ 25 s , which is the relaxation time associated with an entangled polymer reptating out of its confining tube . Different from linear DNA , ring DNA solutions ( 𝜙 = 1 ) exhibit an elastic rubbery plateau over the entire frequency range , indicating very slow relaxation mechanisms at play ( 𝜏 > 100 mins ) , as previously reported and predicted for nominally pure ring melts and ring - linear blends with low fractions of linear chains [ 12 , 17 , 21 - 24 , 29 ] . This slow relaxation has been predicted to arise from ring - ring and ring - linear threading which leads to kinetically arrested states [ 29 , 30 , 79 ] . 9 Figure 2 . Bulk linear rheology of DNA - dextran composites exhibits complex dependence on the topology and volume fraction of DNA . ( A ) Elastic modulus 𝐺′ ( closed symbols ) and viscous modulus 𝐺 " ( open symbols ) as a function of frequency 𝜔 for DNA - dextran composites with linear DNA ( left panel , triangles , dark shades ) and ring DNA ( right panel , circles , light shades ) at volume fractions of 𝜙 = 0 . 25 ( orange ) , 0 . 5 ( green ) and 0 . 75 ( cyan ) and 1 ( purple ) . Terminal regime scalings 𝐺 ′ ( 𝜔 ) ~ 𝜔 −2 and 𝐺 " ( 𝜔 ) ~ 𝜔 −1 are indicated by the scale bars in the left panel . ( B ) Loss tangent tan 𝛿 = 𝐺 " ( 𝜔 ) / 𝐺′ ( 𝜔 ) for data shown in ( A ) with open symbols denoting pure DNA solutions ( 𝜙 = 1 ) . Dashed line denotes tan 𝛿 = 1 which corresponds to low and high crossover frequencies , 𝜔 𝐷 = 2𝜋 / 𝜏 𝐷 and 𝜔 𝑒 = 2𝜋 / 𝜏 𝑒 , respectively . ( C ) Complex viscosity 𝜂 ( 𝜔 ) = [ 𝐺 " ( 𝜔 ) 2 + 𝐺 ′ ( 𝜔 ) 2 ] 1 / 2 / 𝜔 of composites shown in ( B ) and a pure dextran solution ( 𝜙 = 0 , red open squares ) . All composites exhibit shear thinning 𝜂 ( 𝜔 ) ~ 𝜔 −𝛾 with exponents 𝛾 that vary from 0 . 65 to 0 . 88 . ( D ) Plateau modulus 𝐺 𝑁0 versus 𝜙 for composites with ring ( circles , dashed connecting line ) and linear ( triangles , solid connecting line ) DNA . 𝐺 𝑁0 is computed by evaluating 𝐺′ at the frequency in which tan 𝛿 is a minimum . ( E ) Zero - shear viscosity 𝜂 0 = 𝜂 ( 𝜔 → 0 ) versus 𝜙 for composites with ring ( circles , dashed connecting line ) and linear ( triangles , solid connecting line ) DNA determined from 𝜂 ( 𝜔 ) curves shown in ( C ) . ( F ) Shear thinning exponent 𝛾 versus 𝜙 determined from power - law fits to the data shown in ( C ) . Error bars are determined from fits to the data . 10 In contrast to previous studies on ring and linear polymer melts [ 19 , 21 ] , the magnitude of the plateau modulus 𝐺 𝑁0 for ring DNA is several times larger than that for linear DNA . To shed light on this discrepancy , we quantify 𝐺 𝑁0 for all solutions by evaluating 𝐺′ at the frequency at which the corresponding loss tangent tan 𝛿 = 𝐺 " ( 𝜔 ) / 𝐺′ ( 𝜔 ) ( Fig 2B ) is a minimum [ 80 ] . We find 𝐺 𝑁0 ≃ 3 . 24 Pa and ~ 0 . 96 Pa for ring and linear DNA solutions , respectively , such that 𝐺 𝑁 , 𝑅 0 / 𝐺 𝑁 , 𝐿 0 ≃ 3 . 4 ( Fig 2D ) . From 𝐺 𝑁0 we can estimate the polymer length between entanglements 𝑙 𝑒 via 𝑙 𝑒 = 4𝑐𝑅𝑇 / 5𝐺 𝑁0 𝑀 𝐵𝑃 where 𝑐 is the mass concentration and 𝑀 𝐵𝑃 ≈ 650 g / mol is the molecular weight of a DNA basepair ( ~ 1 / 3 nm ) [ 8 , 27 ] . For linear DNA , we find 𝑙 𝑒 ≃ 833 nm and the number of entanglements per chain 𝑁 𝑒 ≈ 10 . As described in Methods , to maintain concentration at 11 𝑐 ∗ , the mass concentration of the nominal ring sample is ~ 3 - fold higher than for the linear sample ( 11𝑐 0 . 9𝑅 ∗ / 11𝑐 𝐿∗ ≃ 2 . 42 / 0 . 78 ≃ 3 . 1 ) due to the smaller 𝑅 𝐺 of rings . As 𝑙 𝑒 ~ 𝑐 / 𝐺 𝑁0 , the ~ 3 - fold larger 𝐺 𝑁0 and 𝑐 for rings is consistent with the fact that we are fixing the degree of polymer overlap and thus 𝑙 𝑒 . Thus , while a ~ 3 . 4 - fold higher 𝐺 𝑁 0 value is , at first glance , at odds with previous studies [ 19 , 21 , 31 ] , the increased mass concentration of our rings compared to linear DNA accounts for this increase . Upon mixing DNA with dextran ( thereby decreasing 𝜙 ) , we find that 𝐺 𝑁0 decreases for rings , while for linear DNA - dextran composites , 𝐺 𝑁0 displays a non - monotonic dependence on 𝜙 with a maximum at 𝜙 = 0 . 75 . For both topologies , 𝜙 ≤ 0 . 5 blends display a high frequency crossover 𝜔 𝑒 in which 𝐺 " > 𝐺′ , which is a measure of the entanglement time 𝜏 𝑒 ≈ 2𝜋 / 𝜔 𝑒 or the time it takes for an entangled polymer to ‘feel’ its tube confinement [ 8 ] . This crossover frequency increases from ~ 0 . 63 at 𝜙 = 0 . 25 to ~ 25 rad / s at 𝜙 = 0 . 5 , independent of DNA topology , and is non - existent for 𝜙 = 0 . 75 and 1 ( implying 𝜔 𝑒 > 100 rad / s ) . These values correspond to 𝜏 𝑒 ≈ 10 s , 0 . 25 s and < 0 . 06 s , for 𝜙 = 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 and > 0 . 5 . The independence of 𝜏 𝑒 on topology can be understood as arising from the matching of 𝑙 𝑒 . Namely , 𝜏 𝑒 ~ 𝑎 4 / 𝐷 0 𝑅 𝐺 , 02 where 𝑎 ≈ ( 𝑙 𝐾 𝑙 𝑒 ) 1 / 2 is the entanglement tube diameter , 𝑙 𝐾 is the Kuhn length ( ~ 100 nm for dsDNA ) , and 𝐷 0 and 𝑅 𝐺 , 0 are the diffusion coefficient and radius of gyration in the dilute limit [ 8 , 27 , 81 ] . Insofar as 𝐷 0 , 𝑅 / 𝐷 0 , 𝐿 ≈ 1 . 32 , 𝑅 𝐺 , 0 , 𝐿 / 𝑅 𝐺 , 0 , 𝑅 ≈ 1 . 58 [ 68 ] , and 𝑙 𝑒 , 𝐿 ≈ 𝑙 𝑒 , 𝑅 , we find 𝜏 𝑒 , 𝑅 ≈ 1 . 8 𝜏 𝑒 , 𝐿 ; such that , within the factor of 2 frequency resolution of our measurements , we can estimate 𝜏 𝑒 , 𝑅 ≈ 𝜏 𝑒 , 𝐿 . Further , if we only consider the DNA in the composites , and use the relations 𝜏 𝑒 ~ 𝑙 𝑒2 , 𝑙 𝑒 ~ 𝑐 / 𝐺 𝑁0 and 𝐺 𝑁0 ~ 𝑐 2 [ 8 ] , it follows that 𝑙 𝑒 decreases as 𝜙 increases ( i . e . , 𝑙 𝑒 ~ 𝑐 −1 ~ 𝜙 −1 ) so 𝜏 𝑒 is likewise expected to decrease , as we find in composites . The decrease in 𝜏 𝑒 between 𝜙 = 0 . 25 and 0 . 50 is stronger than the predicted scaling , suggesting that dextran may serve to increase the entanglement density and overlap of DNA via depletion interactions . To incorporate the effect of the dextran , we use our estimated 𝐺 𝑁 0 values ( Fig 2D ) , along with 𝑙 𝑒 ~ 𝜙 / 𝐺 𝑁 0 and 𝑙 𝑒 , 𝐷𝑁𝐴 ≈ 833 nm , to estimate 𝑙 𝑒 for the different composites . This analysis ( Fig S3 ) shows that , for linear DNA , the 𝜙 = 0 . 75 composites have the smallest predicted 𝑙 𝑒 ( ~ 300 nm ) , whereas for rings , 𝜙 = 1 solutions have the lowest ( ~ 833 nm ) . Taken together , these results suggest that the peak in 𝐺 𝑁0 at 𝜙 = 0 . 75 for linear 11 DNA may be due to depletion - driven DNA self - association and increased overlap in the presence of dextran , which plays a lesser role for ring DNA . Further examination of the loss tangent ( Fig 2B ) shows that , for linear DNA composites , the rubbery plateau , flanked by the low and high frequencies at which tan 𝛿 = 1 ( i . e . , 𝜔 𝐷 and 𝜔 𝑒 ) shifts to longer timescales ( lower 𝜔 ) and extends over a wider 𝜔 range when mixed with dextran . We also see that tan 𝛿 generally increases with 𝜔 for 𝜙 ≤ 0 . 5 composites whereas the opposite is true for 𝜙 > 0 . 5 . This qualitatively different 𝜔 dependence is reminiscent of the difference between rheological properties of extended semiflexible polymers , such as actin filaments , which exhibit solid - like behavior at low 𝜔 and viscous - dominated flow at high 𝜔 [ 82 ] , compared to entangled flexible random coil polymers ( e . g . , DNA ) which display low - 𝜔 flow and high - 𝜔 rubber - like elasticity . This effect may indicate that dextran polymers are acting as depletants to extend and bundle linear DNA molecules , making them more akin to extended semiflexible polymers [ 54 , 55 , 83 ] . As the DNA concentration increases and the dextran concentration decreases the depletion - driven bundling becomes weaker while DNA - DNA entanglements are more abundant so the frequency - dependence is more akin to that of flexible polymers but the modulus is higher . Thus , the maximum in 𝐺 𝑁 , 𝐿 0 at 𝜙 = 0 . 75 , suggests an optimal combination of DNA overlap and depletion - driven stretching and self - association . Below 𝜙 = 0 . 75 , the DNA in the composite has fewer entanglements ( Fig S3 ) , so reinforcement from bundling comes at the cost of losing connectivity , thereby reducing 𝐺 𝑁 , 𝐿 0 . For ring composites , the rubbery plateau is truncated at short times ( high 𝜔 ) in 𝜙 = 0 . 25 and 0 . 5 composites compared to 𝜙 = 0 . 75 and 1 cases in which the plateau regime fully spans over four decades . Further , compared to linear DNA composites , there is limited 𝜙 dependence at low 𝜔 , suggesting that bundling and elongation play minimal roles in ring composites . We suggest instead that the variation in threading propensity of rings dominates the rheology for ring composites . Previously , we found that high dextran concentrations ( > 10 𝑐 ∗ ) led to compaction of ring DNA , rather than stretching , [ 83 ] which would result in fewer entanglements and more viscous - dominated rheology compared to a ring DNA solution at the same degree of overlap , as shown in Fig 2A . Further , due to > 10x smaller coil size of dextran compared to DNA rings , the ability for dextran to kinetically pin rings via threading is likely minimal . Indeed , ring melts that contain a small fraction of short polymer chains have been shown to have reduced viscosity , owing to fewer entanglements , while at the same time the rings swell due to linear chain - end effects [ 40 ] . Such swelling , which may occur for higher DNA volume fractions ( versus compaction observed for higher dextran fractions ) , likely facilitates ring - ring and ring - linear DNA threading in composites that suppress relaxation . Swelling will also limit the fraction of double - folded and amoeba - like ring conformations that can undergo modified reptation but are not threaded [ 25 , 84 ] . Thus , in the 𝜙 = 0 . 75 ring composite the relaxation is likely entirely due to constraint release of threaded DNA , while the 𝜙 = 1 DNA solution has both reptation and threading contributions . This effect can be seen in Fig 2B in which tan 𝛿 for the 𝜙 = 0 . 75 ring composite is smaller than that for 𝜙 = 1 over most of the frequency range ( 𝜔 ≈ 0 . 006 – 6 rad / s ) , indicating the timescale over 12 which threading , which occurs more frequently at 𝜙 = 0 . 75 than 𝜙 = 1 , dominates ( 𝑡 𝑡ℎ ≈ 1 to ~ 10 - 3 s ) . Above and below this timescale , unthreaded and unswollen rings in 𝜙 = 1 solutions may still ‘feel’ the constraints of the entanglement tube ( no measurable 𝜏 𝑒 ) and be confined to reptate within it ( no measurable 𝜏 𝐷 ) . Finally , we evaluate the complex viscosity 𝜂 ( 𝜔 ) ( Fig 2C ) , and , assuming that the Cox - Merz rule is valid for our solutions [ 16 , 18 , 33 , 85 - 87 ] , we estimate the zero - shear viscosity 𝜂 0 = 𝜂 ( 𝜔 → 0 ) ( Fig 2E ) and corresponding shear - thinning exponent 𝛾 ( Fig 2F ) by fitting each curve to a power - law 𝜂 ( 𝜔 ) ~ 𝜔 −𝛾 . Because only the linear DNA solution and 𝜙 = 0 . 25 ring composite exhibit low - frequency plateaus , our 𝜂 0 values for the other cases should be taken as lower limits . As shown in Fig 2D we find that 𝜂 0 for linear DNA composites exhibit a non - monotonic dependence on 𝜙 , corroborating our interpretation of depletion - driven stretching and bundling of linear DNA in composites . Conversely , for rings , 𝜂 0 increases monotonically with 𝜙 , in agreement with previous studies showing that dilute rings in a melt of short linear chains ( akin to low 𝜙 composites ) have lower viscosity than for pure rings [ 40 ] . Further 𝜂 0 is maximum at 𝜙 = 1 rather than 𝜙 = 0 . 75 because 𝜂 0 is evaluated in the long - time limit , such that 𝑡 > 𝑡 𝑡ℎ , so threading events are no longer constraining the rings but tube confinement is still present , as indicated by Fig 2B . The latter is more prevalent for 𝜙 = 1 ring solutions compared to 𝜙 = 0 . 75 composites . We next examine the shear thinning exponents ( Fig 2F ) , which provide insight into the ability of entangled polymers to align with flow [ 18 , 88 , 89 ] . For highly entangled linear polymer melts , 𝜂 ( 𝜔 ) ~ 𝜔 −1 , while shear - thinning exponents of 𝛾 ≈ 0 . 6 – 0 . 9 have been reported for solutions of entangled linear DNA [ 16 , 20 ] . Previous studies on entangled rings report reduced thinning exponents of 𝛾 ≈ 0 . 4 – 0 . 6 [ 16 , 20 ] , owing to the reduced ability of rings to stretch along the shear direction . Our previous studies on ring - linear DNA blends showed a maximum in 𝛾 with comparable concentrations of rings and linear chains , in which threading was most pervasive , suggesting that threading facilitates flow alignment of rings [ 16 ] . Moreover , if we assume rings are compacted by dextran at low 𝜙 while linear chains are stretched and bundled , we would expect minimal flow alignment and thinning for rings and maximal alignment for linear chains at 𝜙 = 0 . 25 and 0 . 5 , which is indeed what we see . For 𝜙 > 0 . 5 , 𝛾 drops significantly for linear DNA whereas it increases a comparable amount for ring DNA . Thus , for rings , threading , mediated by chain swelling , appears to promote thinning whereas for linear chains it is the depletion - driven elongation and increased overlap . 3 . 2 Differential Dynamic Microscopy to determine macromolecular transport properties To shed light on the macromolecular dynamics that give rise to the bulk rheological properties discussed above , we use an optical microscopy attachment to our rheometer to collect time - series of images of diffusing linear and ring DNA in the composites ( Fig S2 ) , and perform DDM analysis on the time - series to determine their transport properties ( Fig 3 ) [ 90 , 91 ] . Importantly , these data 13 are collected in the exact samples and geometry as bulk rheology data immediately before and after rheology measurements ( see Methods ) . Some key questions we seek to answer with this analysis are : ( 1 ) if ring DNA solutions and composites exhibit glassy dynamics , ( 2 ) if mixing of linear DNA with dextran slows its diffusion and / or alters its transport properties , ( 3 ) the extent to which the relaxation and diffusive mechanisms that rings and linear chains exhibit in the different conditions are similar or different , and ( 4 ) if the topology and 𝜙 dependence of bulk rheological properties manifest at the molecular level or if there are scale - dependent phenomena that arise , as seen in other entangled polymer solutions and composites [ 33 , 65 , 92 - 94 ] . Fig 3A shows the characteristic decorrelation times 𝜏 of diffusing DNA polymers versus wavenumber 𝑞 , which we determine by fitting the radially - averaged image structure function 𝐷 ( 𝑞 , Δ𝑡 ) to a stretched exponential , as described in Methods . In general , higher 𝜏 values for a given 𝑞 indicate slower motion . By fitting 𝜏 ( 𝑞 ) to the power - law function 𝜏 = 1 / ( 𝐾𝑞 𝛼 ) , one can determine the type of motion . Normal Brownian diffusion is described by 𝛼 = 2 with 𝐾 equating to the corresponding diffusion coefficient 𝐷 . We can therefore estimate diffusion coefficients for our data by fitting each curve to 𝛼 = 2 scaling ( Fig 2C ) . Conversely , restricted or halted motion , such as in glassy systems , often results in much weaker 𝑞 dependence ( 𝛼 → 0 ) as we see in some of the data ( Fig 3D ) [ 77 , 78 ] . If 𝛼 deviates from 2 then 𝐾 is a generalized transport coefficient with dimensions that depend on 𝛼 ( Fig 3E ) . For both topologies , transport is fastest ( smallest 𝜏 ) and scaling is closest to diffusive ( 𝛼 = 2 ) in dextran solutions ( 𝜙 = 0 ) , and is slowest and exhibits the weakest dependence in 𝜙 = 0 . 75 composites . To better visualize the deviation from normal diffusion and the non - monotonic 𝜙 dependence shown in Fig 3A , we plot 1 / 𝜏𝑞 2 ( Fig 3B ) , which , for diffusive transport , is a horizontal line with a 𝑦 - intercept equal to 𝐷 ( Fig 3C ) . Halted transport or kinetic arrest manifests as a negative slope approaching 𝛼 - 2 ≈ - 2 , as seen for 𝜙 = 0 . 75 ring composites . Such kinetically arrested states , predicted by simulations of ring polymer melts , indicate threading events . It may be possible that ring DNA is threaded by dextran polymers . However , the much smaller size of dextran polymers compared to DNA rings , would limit their ability to halt ring diffusion via constraint release . Indeed , as previously observed in ring - linear melts , short linear polymers ( akin to the dextran used here ) cause tracer rings to swell and the blends exhibit reduced viscosity compared to ring melts , in contrast to when the linear chains are comparable in size to the rings [ 40 ] . Dextran - mediated swelling at 𝜙 = 0 . 75 could facilitate DNA - DNA threading events responsible for glassy behavior , by reducing the fraction of double - folded and collapsed rings [ 25 ] . These results corroborate our bulk rheology data that suggests that threading of rings is most pervasive at 𝜙 = 0 . 75 . Conversely , 𝜙 = 1 and 0 . 5 ring composites exhibit 𝑞 - dependence that is in between diffusive and arrested ( 𝛼 ≈ 1 . 4 ) ( Fig 3D ) , indicative of contributions from populations of both diffusive entangled rings and halted threaded rings – as our rheology results suggest . 14 Figure 3 . Differential dynamic microscopy of DNA - dextran composites show arrested dynamics and non - monotonic dependence on the volume fraction of DNA . ( A ) Characteristic decay time 𝜏 versus wave vector 𝑞 for DNA - dextran composites with linear DNA ( left panel , triangles , dark shades ) and ring DNA ( right panel , circles , light shades ) at volume fractions of 𝜙 = 0 ( red ) , 𝜙 = 0 . 25 ( orange ) , 0 . 5 ( green ) and 0 . 75 ( cyan ) and 1 ( purple ) . Scaling bars indicate diffusive dynamics , i . e . , 𝜏 ( 𝑞 ) ~ 𝑞 −2 . ( B ) Data shown in ( A ) plotted as 𝜏 −1 𝑞 −2 , which equates to a 𝑞 - independent diffusion coefficient 𝐷 for systems that exhibit normal diffusion . Increased negative slopes indicate more arrested or halted motion . ( C ) Diffusion coefficient versus 𝜙 for composites with ring ( circles , dashed connecting line ) and linear ( triangles , solid connecting line ) DNA determined by fitting the data in A to 𝜏 ( 𝑞 ) = 1 / ( 𝐷𝑞 2 ) . ( D ) Transport scaling exponent 𝛼 versus 𝜙 for composites with ring ( circles , dashed connecting line ) and linear ( triangles , solid connecting line ) DNA determined from fitting the data in A to 𝜏 ( 𝑞 ) = 1 / ( 𝐾𝑞 𝛼 ) . Fits are performed over the entire 𝑞 range shown ( filled symbols ) and for 𝑞 > 0 . 9 ( open symbols ) . 𝑞 = 2 signifies normal diffusion and 𝑞 → 0 indicates kinetic arrest . ( E ) Generalized transport coefficient 𝐾 ( left axis , filled symbols ) compared to the corresponding diffusion coefficient 𝐷 ( right axis , open symbols ) versus 𝜙 for composites with ring ( circles , dashed connecting line ) and linear ( triangles , solid connecting line ) DNA determined from fitting the data in ( A ) to 𝜏 ( 𝑞 ) = 1 / ( 𝐾𝑞 𝛼 ) or 𝜏 ( 𝑞 ) = 1 / ( 𝐷𝑞 2 ) . Error bars ( many of which are too small to see ) are determined from fits to the data . 15 Linear DNA composites exhibit similar trends , with minimum 𝛼 and 𝐷 values at 𝜙 = 0 . 75 , followed by 0 . 5 , but the variation in 𝛼 with 𝜙 is much weaker ( Fig 3C , D ) . This weaker 𝜙 - dependence for linear chains is more evident when we evaluate the generalized transport coefficients 𝐾 for the different composites : 𝐾 exhibits a weaker 𝜙 - dependence for linear chains than the corresponding diffusion coefficient ( Fig 3E ) . Further , the pure linear DNA solution exhibits diffusive scaling ( 𝛼 ≈ 2 ) , in contrast to the rings ( 𝛼 ≈ 1 . 4 ) . These topology - dependent effects highlight the distinct relaxation mechanisms at play in the different composites . Namely , threading dominates ring composites whereas depletion - driven DNA stretching and self - association mediate the restricted diffusion in linear DNA composites . These different transport modes are expected to have different degrees of microscale heterogeneity [ 95 , 96 ] , which we evaluate by examining the spread in the intermediate scattering functions ( ISF ) generated from DDM performed on different ROIs in the time - series ( Fig S5 ) . In general , the spread in the ISF for rings is larger than that for linear composites , in line with simulations that show that topological glasses exhibit heterogeneous transport [ 29 , 30 ] . Moreover , considering the ring composites , the spread in the ISFs for 𝜙 = 0 . 5 and 1 are significantly broader than that for 𝜙 = 0 . 75 , indicating that the 𝜙 = 0 . 75 composite is dominated by a single transport mode ( i . e . , threading ) whereas 𝜙 = 0 . 5 and 𝜙 = 1 composites undergo a combination of modes ( i . e . , threading and modified reptation ) which occur over varying timescales . Finally , we note that the scaling of 𝜏 ( 𝑞 ) is weaker at smaller 𝑞 values ( i . e . , longer lengthscales 𝜆 ) , as depicted by comparing 𝛼 values computed over the entire 𝑞 range ( 𝑞 = 2𝜋 / 𝜆 ≈ 0 . 3 – 2 . 5 𝜇m −1 , 𝜆 ≈ 2 . 5 − 20 𝜇 m ) to those excluding 𝑞 𝑐 ≲ 0 . 9 𝜇m −1 ( 𝜆 𝑐 ≳ 7 𝜇 m ) ( Fig 3D ) . We can understand this effect and the corresponding lengthscale 𝜆 𝑐 as arising from entanglements and threadings that hinder polymer motion beyond a few entanglement lengths 𝑙 𝑒 [ 95 , 97 ] , such that restricted transport ( 𝛼 → 0 ) will be more apparent for 𝜆 > Ο ( 𝑙 𝑒 ) . Indeed , Fig S3 shows that the range of 𝑙 𝑒 values for the different composites span from ~ 0 . 3 𝜇 m ( for linear 𝜙 = 0 . 75 ) to 20 𝜇 m ( for ring 𝜙 = 0 . 25 ) , on the order of 𝜆 𝑐 , corroborating this interpretation . 3 . 3 Single - molecule tracking to corroborate DDM and expand the spatiotemporal scales of transport measurements To further understand the non - monotonic dependence of transport and rheology on 𝜙 , and the 𝜙 - dependent differences between ring and linear DNA , we perform single - molecule tracking measurements of DNA in 𝜙 = 0 . 75 and 𝜙 = 1 composites . We focus on 𝜙 = 0 . 75 as it deviates most strongly from normal diffusive scaling for both topologies . Fig 5 shows the center - of - mass mean - squared displacements ( 𝑀𝑆𝐷 ) versus lag time ∆𝑡 for ring and linear DNA at 𝜙 = 0 . 75 and 1 . All cases exhibit anomalous subdiffusion , i . e . , 𝑀𝑆𝐷 〜 ∆𝑡 𝛽 where 𝛽 < 1 . For both 𝜙 values , rings display greater deviation from normal diffusion compared to linear DNA , with an average value of 𝛽 ≃ 0 . 34 compared to ~ 0 . 67 for linear chains . These values are comparable to , but slightly lower than , those previously reported for tracer ring and linear DNA molecules in networks of cytoskeleton filaments [ 93 , 95 , 97 ] . In those experiments the lower 𝛽 value for rings was attributed 16 to threading by cytoskeleton filaments , further supporting our interpretation of our results shown in Figs 2 and 3 . Notably , previous tracking experiments of tracer ring and linear DNA in concentrated dextran solutions reported normal diffusion [ 56 , 83 ] , similar to our DDM measurements ( Fig 3 ) , supporting our conclusion that threading by dextran does not contribute to the phenomena we report here , and that subdiffusion of linear DNA in composites arises from DNA - DNA bundling which requires a critical fraction of DNA . Subdiffusive transport , with similar exponents to our linear DNA composites , has also been reported for entangled solutions of stiffer and more extended actin filaments [ 98 , 99 ] , further indicating bundling and stretching as the mechanism underlying the hindered diffusion and Increased elasticity of linear DNA composites compared to monodisperse DNA solutions . Figure 4 . Ring and linear DNA exhibit topology - dependent subdiffusion at high DNA volume fractions . 𝑀𝑆𝐷 versus lag time ∆𝑡 for linear ( triangles ) and ring ( circles ) DNA diffusing in composites with DNA volume fractions of 𝜙 = 1 ( dark and light purple ) and 𝜙 = 0 . 75 ( dark and light blue ) . Black lines represent power - law scaling with exponents listed . The exponent 𝛽 from fitting each curve to 𝑀𝑆𝐷 〜 ∆𝑡 𝛽 is listed to the right of each curve . In all cases , DNA exhibits subdiffusion ( 𝛽 < 1 ) with rings displaying greater deviation from normal diffusion ( 𝛽 = 1 ) than linear DNA . For both topologies 𝑀𝑆𝐷 s are ~ 2x lower in 𝜙 = 0 . 75 composites compared to 𝜙 = 1 . Further , 𝛽 is slightly lower ( outside of measured error ) for 𝜙 = 0 . 75 compared to 𝜙 = 1 for both topologies , and the value of the 𝑀𝑆𝐷 at a given lag time is ~ 2 - fold lower , in line with our DDM 17 and bulk rheology data . The strongly anomalous diffusion and concomitantly low 𝑀𝑆𝐷 for rings at 𝜙 = 0 . 75 corroborate our interpretation of glassy dynamics due to threading . Finally , we note that the timescale probed by single - molecule tracking is lower than for DDM ( Fig 1B ) , corresponding to 𝜔 ≃ 0 . 6 - 30 rad / s . In this range , the linear DNA solution ( 𝜙 = 1 ) exhibits more elastic - like behavior compared to lower frequencies , probed by DDM , in which it exhibits terminal flow behavior . As such , DDM measurements show 𝜙 = 1 linear DNA obeying normal Brownian diffusion ( 𝛼 ≈ 2 ) while single - molecule tracking experiments show subdiffusive transport . 3 . 4 Coupling bulk rheological properties to macromolecular dynamics To quantitatively compare and couple bulk and molecular - level dynamics we compare the diffusion coefficient determined from DDM ( Fig 3D ) to the zero - shear viscosity measured via bulk rheology ( Fig 2E ) . In Newtonian fluids ( as well as some non - Newtonian fluids ) these quantities are inversely related via the Stokes - Einstein fluctuation - dissipation relation , such that 𝐷 vs 𝜂 0−1 should exhibit linear scaling , provided the size and conformation of the polymers are not changing . As shown in Fig 5A , we find that , in general , higher diffusion coefficients are coupled to lower viscosities , as we may expect . However , examination of 𝐷 vs 𝜂 0−1 reveals regions of the phase space in which the metrics of mobility at the molecular - level ( 𝐷 ) and bulk - level ( 𝜂 0−1 ) do not scale together ( Fig 6C ) . For example , ring composites with 𝜙 = 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 and 1 have nearly identical diffusion coefficients yet the corresponding 𝜂 0−1 values vary by two orders of magnitude . Conversely , it is clear that the 𝜙 = 0 . 75 ring composite is the least mobile and the 𝜙 = 1 linear DNA is the most mobile across all scales . We also compare the bulk shear thinning exponent 𝛾 with the deviation of the DDM transport coefficient from diffusive dynamics , which we define as the quantity 2 - 𝛼 ( Fig 6B ) . Both metrics quantify constraint , with 𝛾 ranging from 0 for Newtonian fluids to 1 for highly entangled or threaded systems and 2 - 𝛼 spanning from 0 for normal Brownian diffusion to 2 for arrested dynamics . As such , we expect the 𝜙 and topology dependence of 𝛾 and 2 - 𝛼 to track with one another . This relationship loosely holds for many of the composites , with the 𝜙 = 0 . 75 ring composite appearing the most constrained and the 𝜙 = 1 linear composite exhibiting negligible constraints across all scales . However , we also find cases , such as 𝜙 = 0 . 25 and 0 . 5 linear DNA composites , that appear highly entangled and constrained at the bulk scale while displaying relatively little deviation from diffusive scaling at the molecular scale . 18 Figure 5 . Coupling of bulk and molecular - level metrics reveals emergent scale - dependent dynamics in DNA - dextran composites . ( A ) Diffusion coefficient 𝐷 determined from DDM ( left axis , closed symbols ) and zero - shear viscosity 𝜂 0 ( right axis , open symbols ) determined via bulk rheology for DNA - dextran composites with linear ( triangles ) or ring ( circles ) DNA at varying DNA volume fractions 𝜙 . ( B ) Deviation from diffusive DDM scaling , quantified by 2 - 𝛼 ( left axis , closed symbols ) , and shear - thinning exponent 𝛾 ( right axis , open symbols ) determined via bulk rheology versus 𝜙 for DNA - dextran composites with linear ( triangles ) and ring ( circles ) DNA . ( C ) Data shown in ( A ) plotted as 𝐷 versus 𝜂 0−1 for DNA - dextran composites with ring ( circles , dashed connecting line ) and linear ( triangles , solid connecting line ) DNA . Both quantities are measures of mobility with larger values indicating higher mobility , as indicated by the gradients . ( D ) Data shown in ( B ) plotted as 2 - 𝛼 versus 𝛾 for DNA - dextran composites with ring ( circles , dashed connecting line ) and linear ( triangles , solid connecting line ) DNA . Both quantities are indicators of steric constraints with larger values indicating more constrained dynamics , as indicated by the gradients . Finally , the data in Fig 5 show that 𝜙 = 0 . 25 linear DNA composites have increased bulk 𝜂 0 and 𝛾 values and reduced microscale 𝐷 and 𝛼 values compared to 𝜙 = 1 linear DNA solutions , while the opposite is true of all metrics for rings . We understand this effect as arising from the loss of DNA - 19 DNA threadings which , when present , lead to kinetically arrested states that suppress bulk dissipation . Further , dextran solutions at sufficiently high volume fractions ( comparable to 𝜙 ≤ 0 . 5 composites ) have been shown to compact ring DNA which would serve to reduce entanglements with neighbors at low DNA concentration . Indeed , we show that 𝑙 𝑒 for rings at 𝜙 = 0 . 25 is greater than the DNA contour length 𝐿 and greater than that computed assuming 𝑙 𝑒 ~ 𝜙 −1 scaling , indicating that compaction and reduced entanglements dictate ring dynamics at low 𝜙 . Conversely , recent work demonstrates that rings are swollen by short linear polymers when the linear polymers are below the entanglement threshold ( such as in our high 𝜙 composites ) [ 40 ] . This swelling , like the stretching of linear DNA , promotes entanglements and threading , which likewise facilitates shear thinning ( Fig 2F ) . As such , we argue that rings switching between compacted and swollen states , underlies the phenomenon that the diffusion coefficient 𝐷 is lower , and the zero - shear viscosity 𝜂 0 and shear thinning exponent 𝛾 are higher , for linear versus ring DNA composites at 0 ≤ 𝜙 ≤ 0 . 5 , whereas rings become slower and exhibit enhanced bulk viscosity and shear thinning compared their linear counterparts beyond 𝜙 = 0 . 5 . These emergent regions of the phase space , indicate that composites can exhibit scale - dependent dynamics tuned by the relative concentrations of DNA and dextran as well as the DNA topology . These data also demonstrate the need for coupled microscale and bulk measurement methods to shed light on the physics underlying the rheology and transport properties that complex systems manifest . A final example to demonstrate this point is the apparent discrepancy between 𝐷 measured via DDM and 𝜏 𝐷 measured via bulk rheology for 𝜙 = 1 linear DNA . For entangled linear polymers , 𝜏 𝐷 ≈ 𝐿 02 / 𝐷 where 𝐿 0 ≈ ( 𝐿 / 𝑙 𝑒 ) 𝑎 is the primitive path length of the polymer [ 8 ] . For our linear DNA solution , we measure 𝐷 ≈ 9 nm 2 / ms via DDM , within a factor of two of the value measured previously with single - molecule tracking [ 69 ] . Using this value gives 𝜏 𝐷 , 𝑚𝑖𝑐𝑟𝑜 ≈ 920 s , which is substantially larger than 𝜏 𝐷 , 𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘 ≈ 25 s measured via bulk rheology . However , because our entanglement density of 𝑍 ≈ 𝐿 / 𝑙 𝑒 ≈ 10 ( determined from 𝐺 𝑁0 , see Figs S3 and 2D ) is well below Ο ( 10 2 ) , we cannot ignore contour length fluctuations ( CLF ) , i . e . , fluctuations in the length of the primitive path , which reduce the disengagement time [ 8 ] . Specifically , CLF contributions are predicted to reduce 𝜏 𝐷 according to the relation 𝜏 𝐷 ( 𝐶𝐿𝐹 ) ≈ 𝜏 𝐷 ( 1 − 𝑋 √𝑍 ) 2 where 𝑋 is a numerical factor that is of order unity and predicted to be greater than ~ 1 . 5 [ 8 , 100 ] . Using 𝜏 𝐷 ( 𝐶𝐿𝐹 ) ≈ 𝜏 𝐷 , 𝑏𝑢𝑙𝑘 ≈ 25 s and 𝜏 𝐷 ≈ 𝜏 𝐷 , 𝑚𝑖𝑐𝑟𝑜 ≈ 920 s , we compute 𝑋 ≈ 2 . 6 , which is indeed of order unity and > 1 . 5 . Thus , not only do our bulk and molecular - level measurements align with one another , but , taken together , they demonstrate the significance of CLF contributions to entangled chain dynamics and shed light on the numerical factor that relates the two for entangled DNA . Conclusions In summary , we have coupled bulk rheology measurements with fluorescence imaging and DDM analysis to directly correlate the bulk viscoelastic properties of entangled DNA - dextran composites to the corresponding microscale polymer transport ( Fig 1 ) . Importantly , we performed both 20 measurements – at lengths scales that differ by ~ 4 orders of magnitude – on the exact same samples , under the same conditions , and within minutes of each other . In this way , we explicitly connect macroscopic rheological properties to the underlying macromolecular dynamics ( Fig 5 ) . We show that DNA - dextran composites exhibit topology - dependent non - monotonic dependences of both bulk rheological properties and macromolecular transport properties on the fraction of DNA comprising the composites . We attribute this emergent behavior to the different ways in which dextran polymers alter the conformation and self - association of ring and linear DNA via depletion interactions . Rings may be either compacted ( at 𝜙 ≤ 0 . 5 ) or swollen ( at 𝜙 = 0 . 75 ) by dextran . When swollen , threadings by neighboring DNA give rise to near kinetic arrest . For linear DNA , depletion - driven stretching and bundling of the DNA may either reduce connectivity ( at low 𝜙 ) or give rise to overlapping extended bundles of DNA with properties akin to semiflexible polymers ( at high 𝜙 ) . More generally , our results demonstrate that for polymer composites , the whole is not always equal to the sum of its parts , rather mixing polymers with distinct structures , sizes and topologies can give rise to emergent dynamics that can either span from microscopic to macroscopic scales or display scale - dependence depending on the composite composition . We further show that polymer end - closure plays an important role in interactions between the different species comprising the composites , with ring polymers conferring uniquely suppressed dissipation and relaxation .
