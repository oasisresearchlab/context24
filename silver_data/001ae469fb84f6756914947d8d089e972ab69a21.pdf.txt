V . 2008 Abstract Epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) has long been associated with breast cancer cell invasiveness and evidence of EMT processes in clinical samples is growing rapidly . Genome - wide transcriptional proﬁling of increas - ingly larger numbers of human breast cancer ( HBC ) cell lines have conﬁrmed the existence of a subgroup of cell lines ( termed Basal B / Mesenchymal ) with enhanced invasive properties and a predominantly mesenchymal gene expres - sion signature , distinct from subgroups with predominantly luminal ( termed Luminal ) or mixed basal / luminal ( termed Basal A ) features ( Neve et al Cancer Cell 2006 ) . Studies providing molecular and cellular analyses of EMT features in these cell lines are summarised , and the expression levels of EMT - associated factors in these cell lines are analysed . Recent clinical studies supporting the presence of EMT - like changes in vivo are summarised . Human breast cancer cell lines with mesenchymal properties continue to hold out the promise of directing us towards key mechanisms at play in the metastatic dissemination of breast cancer .

In many cases , the EMT occurs transiently , and is followed by the reverse transition ( MET ) at the destination , to result in structures such as the segmental plates , kidney , GI tract , lung and skin ( reviewed in [ 1 ] ) . During EMT , otherwise sessile epithelial cells organised into a collective unit lose charac - teristic cell junctional proteins ( such as epithelial cadherins / adherens junction proteins , tight junction and desmosomal proteins , and lateral integrins ) and cytoskeletal elements ( such as cytokeratins ) , and gain motility ( reﬂected in altered actin organization from cortical bundles into stress ﬁbres ) , mesenchymal cadherins ( such as N - Cadherin and Cadherin - 11 ) , and vimentin - rich intermediate ﬁlaments [ 3 ] . Proﬁling studies have increasingly deﬁned the molecular changes associated with EMT [ 4 , 5 ] . T . Blick (cid:1) M . Waltham (cid:1) E . W . Thompson ( & ) VBCRC Invasion and Metastasis Unit , St .

Traditionally ratio - nalized on the basis of translocation during metastasis , additional aspects of EMT biology , such as resistance to anoikis [ 8 ] , enhanced survival [ 9 ] , genomic instability [ 10 ] and resistance to chemotherapies [ 11 ] have more recently emerged in relation to malignancy . Difﬁculties in deﬁni - tively proving EMT in clinical subjects hindered early acceptance of EMT , leading to a stimulating debate [ 12 – 14 ] , although much evidence has accrued in recent times . This picture is complicated further by the emerging like - lihood that the ultimate metastatic colonization requires a reverse transition ( MET ) , such that evidence of a lack of EMT in metastases may be misleading [ 15 , 16 ] . Also , current concepts suggest that a hybrid state coined meta - stable phenotype is seen after carcinoma EMT , rather than full mesenchymal conversion [ 3 , 17 ] . The mesenchymal proteome is rich in extracellular matrix proteins and associated factors , such as collagens , laminins , ﬁbronectin , SPARC , proteoglycans and their receptors . Accordingly , EMT has been implicated in sev - eral ﬁbroses , including diabetic nephropathy [ 18 , 19 ] , hepatic [ 20 ] and cardiac [ 21 ] . In addition to EMT , endo - thelial – mesenchymal transition has emerged in vascular endothelial cells [ 22 ] . A number of factors which trans - criptionally repress E - Cadherin have emerged as potent EMT drivers during development and cancer . These include the zinc ﬁnger Snail homologs ( Snail1 , Snail2 / Slug , Snail3 ) , and several basic helix - loop - helix - factors such as Twist , ZEB1 / , ZEB2 / SIP1 and TCF3 / E47 / E12 ( reviewed in [ 23 ] ) . Indications of EMT in breast cancer cell lines Evidence of EMT in a breast cancer setting came from observations that invasiveness of human breast cancer cell lines in vitro , and metastatic potential in vivo , correlated better with the expression of the mesenchymal intermediate ﬁlament protein vimentin than with lack of oestrogen receptor ( [ 24 ] ; see also Table 1 for summary of this section ) . These cells lines were further found to exhibit reduced cy - tokeratin levels , and reduced or absent components of the various cell : cell adhesion complexes such as E - cadherin , desmoplakin and ZO - 1 [ 24 – 27 ] . N - cadherin expression was often found to be selectively expressed in cell lines showing reduced or absent E - cadherin [ 28 ] , and N - cadherin trans - fection promoted breast cancer cell invasiveness independent of whether it caused loss of E - cadherin or not [ 28 , 29 ] . Vimentin itself was thought initially to serve as a marker of the mesenchymal state , however recent data sug - gests that it also plays a functional role in the mesenchymal phenotype ( reviewed in [ 30 ] , see also [ 31 – 33 ] ) . Several systems have emerged in which EMT can be induced in human mammary epithelial cells and / or human breast cancer cell lines ( also reviewed in [ 30 , 34 ] ) . The MCF10A cell line , derived by spontaneous transformation of cells isolated after reduction mammoplasty , appears poised to undergo EMT in response to a variety of factors and through a variety of mechanisms . Combined expres - sion of H - ras and erb B 2 caused a mesenchymal phenotype in 3D Matrigel cultures , although EMT markers were not examined [ 35 ] . MCF10A cells undergo EMT in response to monolayer wounding , and this is enhanced by epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) [ 26 ] . Overexpression of the type I insulin - like growth factor receptor ( IGF - IR ) also causes EMT in MCF10A cells , characterised by Snail - mediated downregulation of E - cadherin , and high levels of NF - j B [ 36 ] . Introduction of the constitutively active p65 subunit of NF - j B into MCF10A cells caused EMT associated with ZEB - 1 , and MCF10A cells chronically exposed to tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF a ) , a potent NF - j B inducer , also exhibited the EMT - like phenotype and ZEB - 1 / ZEB - 2 induction [ 37 ] . The retinoblastoma suppressor - associated protein 46 ( RbAp46 / RBBP7 ) , which is a component of the histone - modifying and - remodelling complexes , also caused EMT in these cells [ 38 ] . Human mammary cell lines derived from normal tissue share a somewhat ‘‘basal’’ phenotype ( see below and [ 39 ] ) , and appear as a group to be prone to EMT . Despite the most normal morphology in 3D Matrigel culture , they share a transcriptome characteristic of the most stellate cell lines – Basal B [ 93 ] . Co - expression of vimentin and E - cadherin is seen in the 184 cells , A1N4 – A1 and A1N4 - B5 transformed derivatives , and single oncogene transfectants , however double oncogene transfectants lose their E - cadherin and become stellate in Matrigel [ 40 ] . TGF - b stimulated EMT in human mammary epithelial cells was recently shown to involve an interplay between a v b 3 integrin and Src [ 41 ] . It is not only such ‘‘basal’’ models which can undergo EMT . MCF - 7 cells are a well accepted model of ER - positive , ‘‘luminal’’ type breast cancer that have been shown recently to undergo EMT changes in response to oestrogen [ 42 ] , and the cell adhesion molecule L1 [ 43 ] . The human breast PMC42 cell line , when ﬁrst estab - lished , was reported to show stem - like capacity , producing 8 morphological subtypes in culture after cloning . It showed oestrogen and progesterone responsivity [ 44 – 46 ] and expression of predominantly luminal cytokeratins 8 and 18 ( reviewed in [ 47 ] ) . The PMC42 - LA is an especially epithelial subline variant which develops acini - like struc - tures in 3 - dimensional Matrigel cultures , and these produce milk proteins in response to lactogenic hormones [ 48 ] . 630 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2008 ) 25 : 629 – 642 123 T a b l e 1 S u m m a r y o f hu m a n b r ea s t ca n ce r ce ll li n e c h a r ac t e r i s ti c s w it h r e s p ec t t o E M T s t a t u s , s ubg r oup i ng , i nv a s i v e n e ss a nd M a t r i g e l m o r pho l ogy C e ll L i n e T ho m p s on N i e m a n 1999 ( 4 ) Z a j c ho w s k i 2 0 01 ( 5 ) P e r ou e t a l . 2000 ( 6 ) C h a r a f e -

Stimulation of PMC42 - LA cells with EGF leads to EMT marker expression both in 2D monolayer culture [ 50 ] and 3D collagen cultures ( unpub - lished data ) , and 3D Matrigel cultures of PMC42 - LA show increased expression of these markers when treated with factors selectively secreted by carcinoma - associated ﬁbro - blasts over normal mammary ﬁbroblasts [ 51 ] . The parental PMC42 cells ( PMC42 - ET ) [ 44 – 46 ] are 100 % VIM - posi - tive ( Fig . 1 ) and also respond to EGF with increased VIM expression and a further reduction in their already low E - cadherin levels ( not shown ) . Thus , the PMC42 system provides a spectrum of EMT progression stages , and could provide important leads into the identiﬁcation of markers which either indicate EMT and / or a propensity for breast cancer cells to undergo an EMT . One observation in the PMC42 system is that the end result from the EGF - induced EMT is not fully mesenchymal [ 50 ] , and there are a growing number of such observations of this so - called ‘metastable state’ in various EMT / MET systems in vitro and in vivo [ 17 , 52 – 55 ] . The advent of gene array technology has allowed increasingly larger analyses of human breast cancer cell lines ( summarised also in Table 1 ) . Gene array analysis of the NCI60 cell lines showed strong divergence between the more epithelial MCF - 7 and T47D cells and invasive lines such as Hs578T and BT - 549 [ 56 ] . MDA - MB - 435 clustered into the melanoma group and ultimately was proven to be the M14 melanoma cell line [ 57 ] . Studies by Zajchowski conﬁrmed an association between mesenchymal status and invasiveness [ 58 ] . Mesenchymal gene products dominated a 24 gene signature predicting invasiveness of human breast cancer cell lines , while high levels of cytokeratins 18 and 19 and plakoglobin , amongst other epithelial markers , predicted non - invasiveness . In compiling a comprehensive review on human breast cancer cell lines , Lacroix and Leclerq also summarised gene array data partitioning invasive / mesenchymal - like / Basal breast cancer cell lines from those with Luminal / epithelial properties [ 59 ] . Lombaerts et al . [ 60 ] showed that while cell lines in which E - Cadherin had been silenced through promoter methyla - tion showed a mesenchymal phenotype , this was not seen when E - Cadherin was absent due to sporadic mutation , such that EMT arose through an orchestration of coordi - nated gene regulation . Such studies have recently been expanded further , with good concordance and increased robustness ( also summa - rised in Table 1 ) . Charafe - Jaufrett et al . interrogated 31 breast cancer cell lines with Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 . 0 arrays and found that the cells clustered into Luminal , Basal and Mesenchymal subgroups [ 61 ] . Neve et al . pro - ﬁled 51 human cell lines with Affymetrix HG - U133A chips , and also integrated CGH and proteome analysis [ 62 ] . Each of these provides an exceptional database of gene expression amongst cell lines , and each identiﬁed a subset of mesenchymal - like cell lines . Cell lines clustering to Basal B ( as distinct from Basal A or Luminal ) in the Neve study correspond well to the group designated by Charafe - Jaufrett et al . as Mesenchymal ( compared to Luminal or Basal ) . Exceptions were HCC38 , MCF10A , and SUM149PT which were classiﬁed as Basal ( i . e . Basal A ) , and HCC1500 which was classiﬁed as Luminal . Further genotype analysis of the cell lines by Neve and coworkers found the cell line termed HCC1500 was in fact not that cell line , explaining the inconsistency with the Charafe - Jauffret et al [ 61 ] . Basal B / Mesenchymal cells were shown in both studies to resemble ‘basal / myoepithelial’ cells in the expression of mesenchymal gene products , but lacked a number of cytokeratins seen in myoepithelial cells . Con - sistencies amongst these data engender a degree of conﬁdence in the reproducibility of these cell lines and the robustness and accuracy of gene array technology . We Fig . 1 Immunocytochemical staining of E - Cadherin and Vimentin in the parental PMC42 - ET cells and the epithelial subline PMC42 - LA , using methodology as described [ 50 ] . Note the relative absence of membranous staining of E - Cadherin in the parental cells , and the vimentin - positive subpopulation of vimentin expression ( * 10 – 15 % ) in the LA subline 634 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2008 ) 25 : 629 – 642 123 have explored further the Neve dataset [ 62 ] for aspects of EMT , as described below . EMT markers in HBC cell lines We examined expression of the most widely - used markers for EMT ( Vimentin , E - Cadherin , N - Cadherin , ﬁbronectin ) across the cell lines ( Fig . 2 ) . Vimentin is absent in the majority of lines in the luminal cluster and clearly over - expressed in the Basal B , but also quite widely expressed also in Basal A cell lines which exhibit features of both Basal and Luminal tumours . E - Cadherin , on the other hand , is an important discriminator between Basal A ( which all express levels close to the median ) and Basal B which have reduced expression of it in most lines . Surprisingly , 8 of the 25 luminal cell lines also show reduced expression of E - Cadherin . N - Cadherin and ﬁbronectin , classically used to monitor EMT , each showed relative enrichment in the Basal B subgroup , compared with the other subgroups , although ﬁbronectin expression was relatively high in several Luminal lines . Several N - cadherin - negative lines have clustered as mesenchymal , most notably MDA - MB - 231 , but also SUM149 and SUM1315 . These SUM cell lines appear poorly invasive in early studies [ 28 ] , but more recently have been reported to be highly invasive in Ma - trigel assays [ 58 , 62 ] . Further analysis of additional markers closely deﬁning the Basal B subgroup may reveal important novel mediators of EMT in the breast cancer context . Examination of these in the PMC42 system , and other breast cancer EMT systems may provide support for their potential role in EMT , which then requires further examination at the functional level . Classical EMT drivers in HBC cell lines Considerable literature is emerging on the relative expression of EMT drivers mentioned above in model systems and clinical specimens , on interrelationships among these factors , and on their potency when added ectopically . Since each of these is represented on the Af - fymetrix U133A chips , we assessed their relative expression across the breast cancer cell lines in the Neve data [ 62 ] . A reasonable concordance between expression of these EMT drivers in the Basal B / mesenchymal cell lines Fig . 2 Gene expression levels for common EMT markers in 51 breast cancer cell lines . Median centred mRNA expression levels for ( a ) Vimentin , ( b ) E - Cadherin , ( c ) N - Cadherin and ( d ) ﬁbronectin are shown on a log 2 scale . The 51 cell lines are organised by subclass deﬁned in Neve et al . [ 62 ] . For genes represented by multiple probesets on the arrays , the probeset with the greatest standard deviation across samples was selected Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2008 ) 25 : 629 – 642 635 123 was seen on the whole ( Fig . 3 ) . Snail1 shows very little differential across the subgroups . Snail2 shows overex - pression in quite a few Basal A lines as well as most cell lines in the Basal B group . Twist was expressed in most Basal B lines , but surprisingly , it was also expressed in several Luminal lines . The transcription factor found upregulated in Basal B with the highest discriminator score was ZEB1 / TCF8 . High relative expression of ZEB1 was limited to Basal B lines , with most Basal B cell lines expressing it . Although relative expression of TCF3 did not discriminate between the cell line clusters , it has previously been shown to interact with Twist [ 63 ] , TCF4 [ 64 ] and the ETS - domain protein Elk - 3 [ 65 ] . Higher relative expression of TCF4 is almost exclusive to Basal B and most members of Basal B express it . All members of Basal B have a high relative expression of ELK3 , as do a few members of Fig . 3 Gene expression levels for known EMT transcriptional drivers in 51 breast cancer cell lines . Median centred mRNA expression levels for ( a ) Snail1 , ( b ) Snail2 , ( c ) Twist , ( d ) ZEB1 , ( e ) TCF3 , ( f ) TCF4 , ( g ) ELK3 and ( h ) ELF3 are shown on a log 2 scale . The 51 cell lines are organised by subclass deﬁned in Neve et al . [ 62 ] . For genes represented by multiple probesets on the arrays , the probeset with the greatest standard deviation across samples was selected 636 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2008 ) 25 : 629 – 642 123 Basal A , but no Luminal cell lines have a high level of ELK3 expression . ELF3 , also an ETS - domain protein , is markedly underexpressed by most Basal B cell lines , and almost exclusively so . Several of these factors have each been implicated in various breast cancer EMT systems , resulting in a rather complicated scenario , as described in Table 2 . Recently the high mobility group A2 protein ( HMGA2 ) induced by the Smad pathway during TGF b - induced EMT was shown to integrate transcriptional input for the expression of Snail1 , Snail2 , Twist and inhibitor of differentiation 2 ( ID2 ) , each of which has been implicated in EMT . The complex interplay seen amongst EMT - driving transcription factors may be mediated in part by HMGA2 . Relationships to clinical breast cancer Mesenchymal derivatives of carcinoma cells show a number of attributes which would favour metastasis , such as survival after separation from the collective as individ - ual cells , increased migratory and invasive potential , increased survival in suspension and resistance to apoptosis in response to hormone ablation and chemotherapy . Sus - tained expression of mesenchymal traits would assist in extravasation at the secondary site , and possibly also survival at the secondary site . Evidence of EMT in clinical samples has been somewhat slow to accrue , leading to ongoing controversy as to its existence and relevance [ 12 – 14 ] . A number of factors have been advanced to explain the relative paucity of clinical data , including ( i ) the possibility of an incomplete EMT , resulting in a hybrid state ; ( ii ) the likelihood that EMT in carcinoma would generate small numbers of cells at the tumour edge which would imme - diately divorce themselves from the tumour collective , ( iii ) the production of EMT molecules in other scenarios , such as Snail family members in relation to cell survival , vimentin in myoepithelial cells , EMT markers such as vimentin and N - cadherin in the tumour parenchyma of certain breast cancer subsets , and ( iv ) the apparent requirement for disseminated carcinoma cells to ‘‘re - epi - thelialise’’ in order to generate a viable metastasis [ 14 , 17 ] . In the past year or so , however , considerable support for carcinoma EMT has emerged in reports of EMT - related factors in provocative locations , building on the observa - tion of EMT in colon carcinoma cells at the invasive front [ 66 ] . Vimentin expression in the tumour parenchyma has long been associated with poorer prognostic features , par - ticularly in breast cancer ( reviewed in [ 67 ] ) , however vimentin expression is not itself proof of EMT , and a recent comprehensive study suggested that vimentin - Table 2 Expression of various E - cadherin repressor genes and their correlation with gene products which are typically up or down in invasive breast cancer ( e . g . up : vimentin , Her - 2 , aromatase , down : E - cadherin , Na / K - ATPase b 1 ) .

Zeb1 expression was not examined Lombaerts et al . [ 60 ] Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2008 ) 25 : 629 – 642 637 123 expressing tumours may derive from breast progenitor cells with a bilinear ( glandular , myoepithelial ) differentiation potential [ 68 ] . However , a wide - scale analysis of bladder cancer in 572 patients showed that E - cadherin , beta - cate - nin , plakoglobin , and vimentin , but not N - cadherin , were associated with grade and stage , while plakoglobin only was associated with lymph node status . Low levels of both plakoglobin ( P = 0 . 02 ) and beta - catenin ( P = 0 . 02 ) sig - niﬁcantly associated with survival . Although multivariate analysis showed no signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the EMT bio - markers on survival , alterations associated with plakoglobin were identiﬁed as signiﬁcant prognostic fea - tures in these tumours . More compelling , however , have been the recent reports of the transcriptional drivers of EMT in breast carcinoma . Snail1 expression has been found in inﬁltrating ductal carcinomas associated with lymph node metastases [ 69 , 70 ] and distant metastases including effusions [ 55 , 71 ] , and has been associated with recurrence of experimental breast carcinomas [ 72 ] . Snail2 expression is also associated with tumour effusions , metastasis and recurrence [ 71 , 73 ] , but is also associated with partially differentiated breast cancers [ 55 ] , reﬂective of the role of Snail2 in the developing breast [ 74 ] . Twist expression appears to be speciﬁc for ductal breast carcinoma where it is associated not only with the invasive state but also the development of carcinoma angiogenesis [ 75 ] , and as such is a prognostic factor for poor clinical outcome [ 73 ] . Thus , traditional EMT markers are found in breast cancers in scenarios other than EMT , possibly in a survival role [ 9 ] . ZEB1 expression was stringently coupled to cancer cell dedifferentiation in invasive ductal and lobular breast cancer [ 15 ] and upreg - ulated in invasive cancer cells at the tumour - host interface , where it was accompanied by downregulation of plako - philin - 3 expression levels [ 76 ] . Affymetrix analysis of normal ductal and lobular cells , IDC cells and ILC cells microdissected from cryosections revealed that 7 differ - entially expressed genes which are involved in epithelial – mesenchymal transition , TGF - beta and Wnt signalling ( CDH1 , EMP1 , DDR1 , DVL1 , KRT5 , KRT6 , KRT17 ) could distinguish IDC and ILC [ 77 ] . Recently , array pro - ﬁling of EpCAM - immunopuriﬁed breast cancer cells in malignant effusions revealed a subset enriched for mes - enchymal markers such as vimentin , S100A4 , uPAR and CXCR4 [ 78 ] . Evidence of EMT has also been observed downstream of HOXB7 in bone - marrow derived ( laser catapulted ) breast cancer cells [ 79 ] . Other indications have come from other tumour types . ZEB1 expression was found at the tumour - host interface in colorectal cancer [ 15 ] , and Snail2 , TCF3 , ZEB2 and Snail1 were examined in gastric carcinoma where Snail2 upreg - ulation was found to be associated with E - cadherin downregulation in diffuse and intestinal - type gastric carcinoma , and this effect could be complemented by the presence of other EMT regulators [ 80 ] . EMT signatures have been associated with metastatic progression in mela - noma [ 81 ] , and with high risk in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ; [ 82 ] ) . In prostate cancer speci - mens , nuclear Twist was associated with metastatic potential , and high levels of Twist correlated with altered E - cadherin expression [ 83 ] . Gene expression proﬁles of microscopically dissected intratumoural samples from central and invasive regions of invasive papillary thyroid carcinoma identiﬁed reduced levels of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cell – cell adhesion and communication , indicative of EMT [ 33 ] . In oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma , tumours with reduced E - cadherin or increased Snail1 expression invaded deeper and had more lymph node metastasis and more lymphatic invasion than their counterparts , although Snail1 expression was not signiﬁ - cantly correlated with reduced E - cadherin expression [ 84 ] . Patients with reduced E - cadherin expression or positive Snail1 expression had poor clinical outcomes . One scenario for the regulation of EMT emerged recently in studies of the activation of I j B kinase a ( IKK a ) by the Receptor Activator of NF - j B ( RANK / TNFRSF11A ) . Increased EMT and metastasis occurred though downregulation of the tumour suppressor Maspin . Active nuclear IKK a in mouse and human prostate cancer was found to correlate with metastatic progression , reduced Maspin expression and inﬁltration of prostate tumours with RANK ligand—expressing inﬂammatory cells . [ 85 ] . NF - j B was also implicated in HNSCC [ 82 ] , and mediates EMT effects caused by the principal EBV oncoprotein , latent membrane protein 1 ( LMP1 ) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells . LMP1 induced EMT via Twist , expression of Twist and LMP1 was directly correlated , and expression of Twist was associated with metastasis clinically [ 86 ] . Overexpression of Twist was also correlated with hepato - cellular carcinoma metastasis and its expression was negatively correlated with E - Cadherin expression ( P = 0 . 001 , r = - 0 . 443 ) by tissue microarray [ 87 ] . Another clinical manifestation associated with EMT is drug resistance . Although the mesenchymal subgroup were found to be selectively sensitive to the dual speciﬁc ( c - abl and c - src ) kinase inhibitor Dasatinib [ 88 ] , this is in stark contrast to studies showing that mesenchymal / EMT status in lung carcinoma cell lines correlates with resis - tance to EGFR - tyrosine kinase inhibitors [ 11 , 89 ] . Accordingly , selection for drug resistance has been shown previously to correlate with EMT - like changes [ 25 ] . Despite early indications coming from the mis - identiﬁed MCF7ADR derivative , other selected resistant cells exhibit increased vimentin expression , and recent obser - vations of a similar scenario were reported in colorectal carcinoma cells [ 90 ] . 638 Clin Exp Metastasis ( 2008 ) 25 : 629 – 642 123 Conclusions The growing number of cell lines , and the extent and robustness of the transcriptional analysis now available for breast cancer research , have dramatically increased our capacity to determine and trust phenotype / genotype rela - tionships . We have summarised here some of the many conclusions that can be made in relation to EMT in these systems , and have demonstrated the use of the EGF - inducible EMT in the PMC42 system to begin to validate these . Some expected associations have been conﬁrmed in the dataset ( such as the transcription factors Snail2 , Twist and Zeb1 ) , while others have been found surprisingly lacking ( such as Snail1 ) . Systematic analysis has revealed novel transcription factor associations ( such as TCF4 ) which more tightly deﬁne the Basal B / mesenchymal sub - group . Considerable evidence of EMT in clinical carcinoma has now been documented , with considerable implications for progression and outcome . Associations with the invasive front , with disseminated cells , and with resistance to different drugs should place EMT squarely in the sights of those wishing to control breast cancer , and other carcinomas . The work described here in human breast cancer cell lines highlights their utility in discovering and understanding the molecular processes underpinning breast cancer EMT .
