Membrane remodeling processes during endocytosis are highly regulated by the protein - protein and protein - membrane interactions . In clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis ( CME ) binding of the protein epsin to its receptor lipid phosphatidylinositol - ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) induces the deformation of the membrane . Upon binding of the epsin N - terminal homology domain ( ENTH ) to PIP 2 , conformational changes in the protein lead to a newly formed helix , which inserts into the cytosolic leaflet . By using artificial membrane models the binding affinity and the surface topology upon ENTH binding as a function of the lipid composition were analyzed . With increasing the PIP 2 concentration the experiments on solid supported lipid bi - and monolayers proved a direct relation between the protein occupancy and the lipid content . Subse - quently , this indicates that an accumulation of PIP 2 on the cytosolic leaflet can facilitate the endocytosis rate . Besides PIP 2 also negatively charged lipids with the head group phosphatidylserine ( PS ) can affect protein binding in endocytosis . In presence of PS , higher binding affini - ties and protein occupancies of ENTH to PIP 2 doped membranes were observed . Alt - hough ENTH is known to act as a monomeric protein , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) measurements revealed the appearance of protein clusters induced by PS . Thus , also membrane crowding seems to have an impact on the curvature inducing step in CME . Mutation of the amino acid R114 showed its relevance in ENTH cluster formation as no oligomers were observed with the mutant R114A . Moreover , monolayer penetration experiments were performed to analyze the surface activity of ENTH dependent on the lipid composition . Increasing the PIP 2 content in - creased the critical surface pressure . Addition of PS did not significantly increase the penetration of ENTH into monolayers in a PIP 2 dependent manner , although a higher protein occupancy on supported lipid bilayers was observed . To investigate whether ENTH has an influence on mechanical properties of membranes in the presence of PS , giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) were adhered to NeutrAvidin coated surfaces . Incubation of these GUVs with ENTH resulted in the rupturing of those due to lipid packing defects in the membrane by helix insertion and PS induced clus - ters . These results allow to understand how PS alters the binding structure of ENTH to PIP 2 doped membranes . This in turn also show that the lipid composition contributes to the regulation of protein - dependent membrane deformation during CME . ZUSAMMENFASSUNG . Während der Endozytose wird die Membran durch verschie - dene Protein - Protein und Protein - Lipid Interaktionen reguliert . In der Clathrin - vermit - telten Endozytose ( CME ) bewirkt die Bindung des Proteins Epsin an sein Rezeptorlipid Phosphatidyl - ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphat ( PIP 2 ) eine Membrankrümmung . Durch diese Bindung wird in der Epsin N - terminalen Homologie Domäne ( ENTH ) eine neue Helix ( α 0 ) aus - gebildet , die die cytosolische Lipidmonoschicht der Plasmamembran penetriert . Mit artifiziellen Membransystemen konnten die Bindungsaffinitäten und die Oberflä - chentopologien bei ENTH - Anbindung in Abhängigkeit der Lipidzusammensetzung analysiert werden . Mit zunehmender PIP 2 - Konzentration zeigten die Experimente an fest unterstützten Lipiddoppelschichten und - monoschichten einen direkten Zusam - menhang zwischen der Proteinbelegung und der Rezeptorlipidkonzentration . Dies wiederum deutet darauf hin , dass eine Anhäufung von PIP 2 in der Plasmamembran die Endozytose - Rate steigern kann . Nicht nur bei der Erhöhung der PIP 2 - Konzentration wurde eine höhere Proteinoberflä - chenbelegungen auf Membranen beobachtet , sondern auch in Gegenwart der Lipid - kopfgruppe Phosphatidylserin ( PS ) , welche die Bildung von ENTH Cluster induziert . Somit scheint neben der Helixinsertion auch das Zusammenlagern mehrerer ENTH - Moleküle ( Crowding ) einen Einfluss auf den krümmungsinduzierenden Schritt in der CME zu haben . Mit der Mutante ENTH R114A konnte zudem gezeigt werden , dass die Aminosäure R114 essentiell für die Clusterbildung ist . Penetrationsexperimente an Lipidmonoschichten wurden durchgeführt , um die Ober - flächenaktivität von ENTH in Abhängigkeit von der Lipidzusammensetzung zu analy - sieren . Dabei zeigte die PIP 2 Konzentration einen größeren Einfluss auf den kritischen Oberflächendruck als die Zugabe von PS . Adhärierte Riesenvesikel ( GUVs ) ermöglichten zudem die mechanischen Eigenschaf - ten von Membranen in Abhängigkeit von PS zu untersuchen . Inkubation dieser GUVs mit ENTH führte zum Rupturieren der Vesikel durch die Entstehung von Defekten wäh - rend der Helixinsertion und der PS - induzierten Clusterbildung . Dies zeigt , dass PS ei - nen deutlichen Einfluss auf die Bindungsstruktur von ENTH an PIP 2 Membranen hat . Dadurch konnte auch gezeigt werden , dass die Lipidzusammensetzung zur Regulation der proteinabhängigen Membrankrümmung während der CME beiträgt . 1 Introduction 1 1 I NTRODUCTION Cells are complex systems , consisting of different cell organelles with various func - tions . The cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell and serves as protection from the environment . This barrier function enables the selective control of cell com - munication and molecule exchange . Both processes rely on substance transport , which can either be passive by simple diffusion or by carrier and channel proteins . Contrary to that , active transport requires energy to regulate the uptake of particles . However , large molecules are not able to pass the membrane even though the cell supplies the energy . To overcome this barrier , the transport of large molecules is driven by exo - and endocytosis . 1 . 1 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis One important and well known endocytotic pathway is the clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis ( CME ) . Here macromolecules are internalized into vesicles derived from the plasma membrane . The receptor regulated process enables the controlled entry into cells , which is important for immune response or intercellular communication . 1 , 2 The process is connected to highly coordinated and complex interactions , preventing the entry of unwanted viruses or toxins . Although under certain conditions , like dysfunc - tions , they can gain entry and cause serious diseases . 3 , 4 Since clathrin does not have a binding motif for the membrane , adaptor proteins con - nect clathrin with membrane lipids and other proteins . 5 The uptake of cargo - mole - cules is driven by a complex system of proteins , proceeded in five steps . By membrane binding of accessory proteins first a curvature of the bilayer occurs , followed by the cargo selection via receptor molecules . Then the recruitment of the clathrin triskelia molecules induces the polymerization of clathrin , forming a stable cage around the invagination ( clathrin - coated pit ) . 6 – 8 Scission trough proteins , like dynamin , 9 , 10 leads to the formation of the clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) . In the last 1 Introduction 2 step , the clathrin triskelia cage decays and consequently the cargo molecules are re - leased . This five step mechanism of the clathrin - mediated endocytosis is illustrated in Figure 1 . 1 . Figure 1 . 1 : Schematic illustration of the clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Binding of proteins like epsin and AP2 to the receptor lipid PIP 2 induces an invagination , during which cargo molecules are recruited by receptor proteins . Afterwards polymerization of clathrin leads to a curvature stabilizing cage . Due to further curvature and coat assembly a vesicle is formed . Scission and uncoating result in a free ves - icle , which is transported to the target cell compartment . Figure modified according to Messa et al . 11 The cargo uptake is highly regulated by receptor proteins . Adaptors like AP2 , AP180 / CALM and epsin are noteworthy as they exhibit binding sites for cargo mole - cules and bind clathrin as well as the membrane . 12 – 14 Dephosphorylation of phospha - tidylinositol - ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) by synaptojanin induces a decreased binding to clathrin associated proteins , which destabilizes the clathrin coat and consequently results in uncoating . 15 Uncoated vesicles typically are transported to early endo - somes , where they fuse and release their cargo . 16 Thereafter , the receptors are recy - cled and recruited to be available for the next CME circle . The role of various proteins in CME is still not completely understood . 17 Nevertheless , all membrane - interacting adaptors in CME seem to have at least two functions . Cargo selecting receptors with 1 Introduction 3 the ability to generate membrane curvature ensure the vesicle formation indepen - dent from the cargo molecule . 1 One molecule , which is crucial for membrane reorga - nization during CME is epsin . 1 . 2 Epsin N - terminal homology domain The accessory protein epsin is among other clathrin - associated sorting proteins es - sential for the CME . It was first discovered in 1998 by Chen et al . as Eps15 interacting protein ( epsin ) . 18 Epsin 1 and the three isoforms are present in all vertebrates . 7 Other epsin - like homologues were also found in lower species . ENTH contains several bin - ding motifs , important for different functions . For example , it is essential in signaling activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , contributed in cancer dis - eases , or the epithelial sodium channel as it regulates electrolyte balances . The C - Ter - minus of epsin has a binding site for proteins like Eps15 and intersectin . 18 Further motifs in the protein can interact with ubiquitin and AP2 ( Figure 1 . 2 ) . 19 , 20 Figure 1 . 2 : Schematic structure of epsin 1 with all important binding motifs , necessary for interactions with PIP 2 , ubiquitin , AP2 , clathrin and Eps15 . Derived from Horvath et al . 7 In the CME epsin is recruited to the plasma membrane by the evolutionary well con - served epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain . 20 It consists of about 150 amino acids structured to a superhelix of seven α - helices . At the plasma membrane the do - main specifically recognizes and binds the receptor lipid PIP 2 , resulting in a confor - mational change in the tertiary structure of its ENTH domain . This however leads to the formation of a PIP 2 binding pocket established by the amino acids R7 , R8 , K11 , R25 , R63 , K69 and H73 of the ENTH domain , which accommodates the negative charge of the receptor lipid . 8 , 21 An unstructured 14 amino acids large sequence of the domain becomes ordered , called the α 0 helix . The newly formed helix inserts into the 1 Introduction 4 inner leaflet of the membrane , reduces the energy barrier of bending and conse - quently modifies membrane curvature . Ford et al . were able to co - crystallize the ENTH domain together with inositol - ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) - triphosphate ( IP 3 ) , the head group of PIP 2 ( Figure 1 . 3 ) 22 , showing the structural change in the protein . Figure 1 . 3 : Crystal structures of unbound ENTH and the ENTH - IP 3 complex . Binding to IP 3 leads to the formation of a new helix ( α 0 ) . In the bound state the R114 loop of ENTH is in close contact to the mem - brane . 22 , 23 Itoh et al . showed that the ENTH - PIP 2 binding is specific as the affinity to other inosi - tol species and phospholipids was drastically decreased or missing . 24 Moreover the binding affinity can be influenced by the pH or the lipid composition of the mem - brane . 8 , 25 , 26 The ENTH domain furthermore can induce tubulation in PIP 2 - containing liposomes and also tubular structures in the plasma membrane of living cells . 21 , 27 , 28 Besides the curvature inducing effect , epsin also binds to clathrin in the CME . 29 It con - nects clathrin with the membrane and causes its polymerization , which stabilizes the invagination and the subsequent vesicle formation ( cf . chapter 1 . 1 ) . The complete contribution and interaction of ENTH domain in the network of clathrin associated proteins is still discussed and thus the investigation is important . Some studies indicate that not only the insertion of the amphiphilic helix leads to a curva - ture , but also the assembly of the protein is contributing the membrane curvature process . 30 1 Introduction 5 1 . 3 Interplay of the ENTH assembly and amphiphilic helix insertion Many biological processes depend on highly curved membrane structures , even though induction of curvature is associated with high energy requirements . To over - come this energy barrier an interplay between several proteins in collaboration with lipids is necessary . There are different ways to generate membrane deformation . The epsin ENTH domain is known to induce membrane asymmetry by the insertion of an amphiphilic helix . Ford et al . performed mutagenesis experiments , where they changed the hydrophobicity of the α 0 helix on position L6 . 21 Decreased hydrophobi - city resulted in lower binding affinity and decreased tubulation , showing the impact of the amphiphilic helix of ENTH . Nevertheless , computational studies challenge the efficiency of helix insertion to in - duce membrane deformation . 31 , 32 According to these studies , about 10 - 25 % of the membrane surface have to be occupied by helices . Considering the footprint of ENTH , a physiological improbable coverage of almost 100 % would be necessary . 23 Am - phiphilic helix insertion induced deformation of membranes was also found for other proteins , but usually this effect was supported by the shape of the protein . An example is the N - BAR domain of endophilin . 33 The banana - shaped protein domain is enriched in synapses and stabilizes the helix induced membrane curvature by its curved shape . In contrast to that , ENTH does not show an inherent curvature itself . This leads to the question if an additional effect supports the helix insertion and promotes membrane curvature . Stachowiak et al . assumed that crowding of ENTH drives membrane bending due to lateral pressure resulting from collision of two bound proteins . 30 With increasing pro - tein coverage the pressure increases until the energy barrier is reached to induce membrane deformation . They proved the relevance of the protein crowding mecha - nism with His - tagged ENTH lacking the α 0 helix . Fluorescence microscopy experi - ments with giant unilamellar vesicles showed that high coverage with His - tagged ENTH also resulted in tubular structures , indicating the contribution of protein - pro - tein interaction on the membrane deformation process . 1 Introduction 6 Contrary to that , Kozlov et al . exhibited with computational predictions the high rel - evance of the ENTH insertion mechanism . 34 They calculated the membrane tube ra - dius for different models , which predict that the crowding effect is clearly weaker than the insertion effect . Protein crowding as a non - specific interaction with the membrane would lead to bending on both sides of the membrane , thus counteract the effect on each side . Further studies investigated the protein crowding induced defor - mation , assuming that it is co - regulated by membrane tension and protein coverage . 35 Recent studies showed that binding of ENTH to PIP 2 - containing membranes resulted in the decrease of lateral membrane tension and consequently in a decreased bending modulus . 36 Hence , an interplay of both , the protein crowding and the protein helix insertion of ENTH , seems likely to induce membrane curvature . In Figure 1 . 4 the pre - dicted mechanism involved in ENTH induced membrane bending is illustrated . Figure 1 . 4 : Schematic illustration of the predicted mechanism of ENTH induced membrane curvature . Recruitment of ENTH by PIP 2 results in the insertion of an amphipathic helix ( A ) . The helix insertion of ENTH disturbs the structure of the lipid bilayer ( B ) . Rearrangement leads to a deformation of the membrane . The assembly of several ENTH monomers facilitates further membrane curvature ( C ) , which represents the first step in CME . Besides the effect of proteins , also the lipid composition affects the membrane topo - logy . Due to versatile lipid shapes , charges and intramolecular interactions , they can induce membrane asymmetries promoting membrane curvature . 37 1 Introduction 7 1 . 4 Lipid dependent membrane deformation The plasma membrane consists of various lipids and proteins interacting with each other . Amphiphilic lipids have a hydrophilic head group and long hydrocarbon chain residues . On one hand the lipids in the membrane built the barrier , but additionally they also have other functions for living cells . They are necessary for the energy stor - age or as signal molecules . 38 , 39 Furthermore , the lipid structure or geometry can in - fluence the shape of the membrane due to different packing densities . 40 , 41 If lipids have a large area ratio of head groups to acyl chains , they can create an invagination on the other side of the membrane . The lipids in the membrane are usually distributed asymmetrically , which arises from dynamic flip - flop and lateral diffusion pro - cesses . 42 , 43 Among other effects , this asymmetry can lead to the deformation of the membrane . Certain proteins or molecules are localized in specific compartments of the cell . Asymmetric distribution or even crowding of the lipids in these regions would ensure the protein - lipid interactions , important for several processes . More often the relevance of lipids in membrane deformation is coupled to proteins , which induce this effect . One important lipid , which binds several proteins involved in mem - brane curvature is PIP 2 . In mammalian cells it is the most abundant phosphoinositide species as it incorporates 1 % of all phospholipids , occurring in the plasma mem - brane . 44 It is the source of the two second messengers diacylglycerol as well as inosi - tol - 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate and also interacts with proteins important for the membrane’s attachment to the cytoskeleton . Moreover , several studies revealed the essential role of PIP 2 in exo - and endocytotic processes . 45 – 48 For example , it is an important regula - tor of the BAR domain membrane deformation activity , required in endocytosis . In the CME it is also the major regulator for various clathrin associated proteins . Due to recruitment of AP2 and epsin , the membrane is bent until a vesicle is formed ( cf . chap - ter 1 . 1 ) . Also the uncoating of CCVs is regulated by PIP 2 , enabling the fusion of the vesicle with the membrane of the target cell compartment . 15 , 49 Even though PIP 2 is probably the most essential lipid involved in membrane deformation processes , also other lipids affect them . For example , phosphatidylserine ( PS ) lipids can influence these processes . They are highly enriched in the plasma membrane ( 12 % ) , 37 , 50 espe - cially in the cytosolic leaflet . The anionic lipid is involved in the coagulation cascade 1 Introduction 8 and also in the apoptosis process . 51 , 52 Due to the negative charge it causes membrane deformation by the recruitment of proteins . In neuronal exocytosis PIP 2 and PS bind synaptotagmin - 1 , which triggers fusion . 53 In yeast , the absence of PS translocation leads to an insufficient membrane curvature as PS drives the assembly of involved proteins like clathrin . 54 Furthermore , in CME it recruits proteins to the membrane and significantly affects the efficiency of this process . 55 The exact influence of lipid compositions and their interplay with proteins in the CME is still poorly understood . To investigate such protein - membrane interactions often artificial membrane models were used to mimic biological membranes in a simplified way . This allows the analysis of the contribution of certain lipids in protein induced membrane deformation processes under controlled conditions . 2 Scope of Thesis 9 2 S COPE OF T HESIS Endocytosis processes are regulated by interactions of several proteins and lipids . It enables the transport of important nutrients and signal molecules into cells . Thereby , the clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) represents the main pathway of endocyto - sis , thus the investigation is of great interest . During the CME adaptor proteins , like epsin , bind to the receptor lipid phosphatidylinositol - ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) and induce a membrane curvature . Upon specific binding of the epsin N - terminal homol - ogy ( ENTH ) domain to PIP 2 , a former unstructured region rearranges to a new or - dered helix . Insertion of this helix induces asymmetry within the both bilayer leaflets and facilitates the membrane deformation . The influence of lipids in this mechanism is still not understood completely and will be characterized more precisely within the scope of the thesis . Therefore , different methods will be used to analyze specific interactions of the ENTH with PIP 2 - doped artificial membranes as a function of the lipid composition . In par - ticular the influence of the lipid receptor and the negatively charged lipid phosphati - dylserine ( PS ) on binding affinities and the helix insertion of ENTH will be evaluated . Solid supported lipid membranes will be established to determine the surface occu - pancy and the dissociation coefficient of the ENTH domain . Thereby , the differences in the binding behavior to PIP 2 containing bi - and monolayers will be analyzed as well as the influence of PS . To investigate if besides the helix insertion also a membrane crowding effect induces a membrane deformation , atomic force microscopy will give information about the surface topologies upon ENTH binding . Moreover , mutagenesis experiments moreover shall show the relevance of specific regions within the protein . Monolayer penetration experiments on a Langmuir - Blodgett trough will clarify how the lipid packing influences the helix insertion and consequently the membrane de - formation . Finally , the impact of ENTH on mechanical properties of free - standing membranes in the presence of PS will be analyzed using adhered GUVs to understand the contribution of lipid compositions and membrane tension as regulators for mem - brane deformation processes . 3 Materials and Methods 11 3 M ATERIALS AND M ETHODS 3 . 1 Used Materials 3 . 1 . 1 Buffers For the experiments in this work different buffer systems were used .

These exhibit va - rious head groups , like phosphocholine ( PC ) and phosphoethanolamine ( PE ) , which are found in plasma membranes in a high amount . 56 In order to mimic biological con - ditions experiments with these lipids were performed . Furthermore lipids with the negative lipid head group phosphatidylserine ( PS ) were used as the plasma mem - brane is also enriched with PS ( 12 % ) , especially the cytosolic leaflet ( cf . chapter 1 . 4 ) . 37 , 50 Cholesterol was added in giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) as it is known to increase the mechanical stability of membranes .

For the experiments in this thesis brain extracted PIP 2 was used to bind ENTH . It mainly consists of the fatty acids stearoylic and arachidonoylic acid and has a net charge of - 3 to - 5 dependent on the pH ( - 4 at pH 3 . 7 ) . 3 Materials and Methods 14 Moreover 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( cap biotinyl ) ( cap - bi - otin - DOPE ) was used to bind the protein NeutrAvidin in order to immobilize vesicles via biotin - NeutrAvidin interactions .

It consists of approximately 150 amino acids ( M = 16 . 75 kDa ) and can be found in many endocytotic proteins . The ENTH domain and its mutant R114A used in this work were isolated and purified by Dr . Benjamin Kroppen and Indrani Mukherjee from the group of Prof . Dr . Michael Meinecke ( Department of Cellular Biochemistry , University Medical Center Göttin - gen ) . The protein was stored in protein buffer at - 80 °C . Before use the protein was thawed on ice . 3 Materials and Methods 16 3 . 1 . 3 . 2 NeutrAvidin NeutrAvidin is a 60 kDa protein and was used for the immobilization of biotinylated giant unilamellar vesicles via a NeutrAvidin - biotin interaction . The protein is the de - glycosylated form of the tetrameric glycoprotein avidin . 58 NeutrAvidin as well as avi - din have high binding affinities to biotin , which makes them well - suited for immuno - logical assays and biosensing applications . Deglycosylation does not reduce the biotin binding ability , 59 but due to the more neutral isoelectrical point ( pI = 6 . 3 ) than avidin ( pI = 10 . 5 ) , less non - specific interactions to surfaces occur . 60 3 . 2 Preparative methods 3 . 2 . 1 Preparation of unilamellar vesicles Vesicles are well suited to investigate protein - membrane interactions . They differ in size and application . The radii vary from 20 nm ( small unilamellar vesicles , SUVs ) , 100 - 200 nm ( large unilamellar vesicles , LUVs ) up to 100 µm ( giant unilamellar vesi - cles , GUVs ) . 61 – 63 Small unilamellar vesicles For the preparation of small unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) lipid films with 0 . 4 mg of lipid material were used . These films were obtained by merging different lipid stock solu - tions ( dissolved in chloroform ; c = 2 - 10 mg / mL ) in a test tube . This enabled to pre - pare lipid films with defined lipid compositions . After removing the chloroform in a nitrogen flush , the films were dried under vacuum at 30°C . The films were then stored at 4 °C until use . The films were rehydrated with citrate buffer ( 30 min ) and subsequently the test tubes were vortexed three times for 30 s in a five - minute interval , resulting in the formation of multilamellar vesicles ( MLVs ) . The MLVs were then treated in an ultra - sonic bath for 30 min at RT to obtain SUVs . 3 Materials and Methods 17 Giant unilamellar vesicles Giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) with a diameter of ≦ 1 µ m were prepared by an electro - formation process , first described by Angelova et al . 64 A mixture of lipids dis - solved in chloroform ( c = 0 . 5 mg / mL ) were added on two indium tin oxide ( ITO ) co - vered glass slides . The chloroform was removed under reduced pressure for at least 30 min , resulting in a lipid film on top of the ITO . These ITO slides were then assem - bled to a chamber and sealed with a silicon ring and two Teflon spacers . Afterwards a sucrose solution ( 298 mOsmol / kg ) was filled into the chamber . The connection to the generator was achieved with copper stripes , so each ITO slide was linked to one pole ( Figure 3 . 1 ) . A sinusoidal alternating current voltage of 1 . 6 V ( peak - to - peak ) and 10 Hz was applied for 3 h , resulting in GUV formation . After collection of the GUVs they were stored at room temperature for a maximum 3 days . Figure 3 . 1 : Schematic drawing of a GUV electro - formation chamber . On each ITO slide a self - adhesive copper stripe is placed via a Teflon spacer . The Teflon spacers connect the chamber with a voltage source , which results in the formation of GUVs . 3 Materials and Methods 18 3 . 2 . 2 Substrate surface preparation Various experimental methods require different substrates , which vary in material or size . Due to this , surface functionalization strategies can be used to obtain stable membrane models . In this work two different functionalized substrate types were employed to generate supported lipid membranes and adhered giant unilamellar ves - icles . Lipid bilayer and monolayer on silicon dioxide wafers Silicon wafers coated with silicon dioxide ( SiO 2 ) from Silicon Materials , Inc . ( PA , USA ) were cut into 1 . 9 cm x 0 . 8 cm rectangles . For reflectometric interference spectroscopy ( RIfS ) experiments wafers with 5000 nm SiO 2 layer thickness and for atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) measurements wafers with 100 nm SiO 2 were used . For both techniques the substrates were hydrophilized with an aqueous ammonia hy - drogen peroxide solution ( H 2 O / NH 3 ( 25 % ) / H 2 O 2 ( 30 % ) 5 : 1 : 1 ( v / v / v ) ) for 30 min at 70 °C . Hydrophilized substrates were rinsed with ultrapure water and stored in ul - trapure water . Before use the substrates were dried in a nitrogen flush and treated with oxygen plasma ( 30 s , 0 . 2 mbar , 60 % power ) . Afterwards , SUVs were spread on the hydrophilic surfaces , resulting in a lipid bilayer . Lipid monolayers were prepared on hydrophobic silicon wafers . Therefore , the wa - fers were first cleaned with Hellmanex ( 15 min ) and ultrapure water ( 2 x 15 min ) in an ultrasonic bath . Then they were treated with oxygen plasma ( 30 s , 0 . 2 mbar , 60 % power ) and subsequently incubated with 1 , 1 , 1 , 3 , 3 , 3 - Hexamethyldisilazane ( HMDS ) . Incubation was performed overnight in a sealed chamber at 120°C and under reduced pressure , yielding hydrophobic surfaces ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . 3 Materials and Methods 19 Figure 3 . 2 : Hydrophobic functionalization of silicon dioxide wafers with HMDS . Silanization and PEGylation to generate adhered GUVs First , glass slides had to be functionalized with NeutrAvidin to obtain immobilized biotinylated giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) . The glass slides ( 24 x 50 mm , Ther - moFisher Scientific Gerhard Menzel , Brunswick , Germany ) were cut into 1 . 0 cm x 1 . 0 cm substrates , cleaned with ethanol p . a . and ultrapure water . After treat - ment with oxygen plasma ( 30 s , 0 . 2 mbar , 60 % power ) pure 3 - glycidyloxi - propyltri - methoxysilane ( GOPTS , stored in an argon atmosphere ) was added between two sub - strates and incubated for one hour at 80 °C in a glass weighing bottle with an argon atmosphere . In that time , a mixture of methoxy - and biotin - functionalized PEGs ( 1 : 1 , 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 ) was heated in a thermomixer at 85 - 95 °C ( dependent on the PEG - length ) and 1400 rpm . The substrates were separated from each other and then rinsed with acetone . Drying in a nitrogen flush and placing the substrates on a preheated alumi - num block ( 80°C ) enabled the addition of 200 µL of the molten PEG - mixture between two substrates without solidification . Afterwards , the substrates were placed in the weighing bottle and incubated at 85 - 95 °C for 4 h . The substrates were separated , in - tensely rinsed with ultrapure water and dried in a nitrogen flush . If the molten PEG mixture was still present on the substrates ( impure surface ) , the rinsing step was re - peated . Prior to use the substrates were stored under argon at 4 °C . The silanization and PEGylation is illustrated in Figure 3 . 3 . 3 Materials and Methods 20 Figure 3 . 3 : Silanization and PEGylation of glass substrates , resulting in methoxy - PEG and biotin - PEG surfaces . To obtain adhered GUVs , the functionalized substrates were first incubated with Neu - trAvidin ( 50 µg / mL in PBS ) for 30 min . Then the NeutrAvidin - functionalized sub - strates were rinsed six times with PBS and further six times with sucrose buffer . 10 - 50 µL of a biotin - containing GUV suspension ( in sucrose ) was added and incubated for 15 min in a humidity chamber to avoid osmolar changes . Via biotin - NeutrAvidin interactions the GUVs adhered to the surface . To verify a complete coverage of the substrates with NeutrAvidin , the surface was incubated with DyLight ® 594 labeled Neutravidin / unlabeled NeutrAvidin in a ratio of 99 : 1 . 3 . 3 Biophysical methods 3 . 3 . 1 UV - Vis spectroscopy The determination of ENTH solutions’ concentration was done using UV - Vis spectros - copy . This method is based on the absorption of ultraviolet ( UV ) and visbible ( Vis ) light . 65 Proteins with aromatic amino acid residues ( Phenylalanine , Trypthophan , Ty - rosine ) exhibit an absorption maximum at λ = 280 nm due to π ⟶ π * transition within 3 Materials and Methods 21 the amino acids . Measurements of the absorption A 280 at this wavelength allowed the calculation of the protein concentration via the Lambert - Beer law : 𝐴 280 = 𝜀 𝐸𝑁𝑇𝐻 ∙ 𝑐 ∙ 𝑑 ( 3 . 1 ) The extinction coefficient of the ENTH - domain is 25440 M - 1 cm - 1 and the cuvette thick - ness is d = 1 cm . The molecular masses and extinction coefficients of ENTH were cal - culated with the ExPASy ProtParam tool . 66 The measurements were performed using the NanoDrop TM 2000c ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . 3 . 3 . 2 Reflectometric interference spectroscopy Reflectometric interference spectroscopy ( RIfS ) was used to determine the binding of the ENTH domain to lipid bilayers . It is a label - free optical biosensing method , which detects time - resolved changes in optical thicknesses at interfaces between two media with different refractive indices ( n ) . 67 , 68 The method is based on the reflection and transmission of white light at these interfaces 69 A light beam is directed to the interface , where it is partially reflected and refracted . Superimposition of the partial beams leads to a specific interference pattern . Changes of the surface thickness ( phys - ical thickness d ) due to e . g . protein adsorption lead to an altered interference spec - trum . The law of Snellius describes the refraction of light on interfaces with the incident angle α , the refracting angle φ and the different refractive indices n ( equation ( 3 . 2 ) ) . 𝑛 1 ∙ sin ( 𝛼 ) = 𝑛 2 ∙ sin ( 𝜑 ) ( 3 . 2 ) Depending on the refractive indices of the media , the reflection and transmission of the light changes . In Figure 3 . 4 three possible light pathways are illustrated . 3 Materials and Methods 22 Figure 3 . 4 : Schematic illustration of the SNELLIUS reflaction law . With an incident angle the light is directed to a second medium . Due to the different refractive indices of both media the light can have various light pathways . In case of n 1 = n 2 the light is reflected and reflected with the same angles ( α = φ ) . When the refractive index of the first medium is higher than the second ( n 1 > n 2 ) , the light is refracted to the vertical ( α > φ ) . If the relation of n 1 < n 2 occurs , the light is tilted out of the vertical ( α < φ ) . If the refractive indices n 1 and n 2 have the same value ( Figure 3 . 4 A ) , the angles α and φ are equal , then the light is reflected and transmitted in the same degree . With n 1 < n 2 , the light is refracted when it is passing the second medium and the relation φ < α is valid ( Figure 3 . 4 B ) . In the latter case , the transmitted light is tilted out of the vertical due to the higher refractive index of the second medium ( n 1 > n 2 , Figure 3 . 4 C ) . In the experimental setup , utilized in this work , the light is directed to a three phase system : An opaque silicon layer followed by a silicon dioxide layer , which is sur - rounded by an aqueous phase ( Figure 3 . 5 ) . 3 Materials and Methods 23 Figure 3 . 5 : Schematic light pathway during a RIfS experiment . The light is directed to a system consist - ing of three phases with an incident angle α . Reaching the silicon dioxide layer with a thickness d after passing the aqueous medium , the light is reflected ( I 1 , blue ) and refracted ( I 2 , red ) to the vertical at an angle φ due to different refractive indices ( n i ) . As the silicon layer is intransparent the light is com - pletely reflected , resulting in an additional traveling distance s for I 2 . With the incident angle α the light passes the aqueous medium ( n 1 = 1 . 33 at 20 °C ) . 70 When it is hitting the silicon dioxide layer ( n 2 = 1 . 45 ) 71 the light is refracted towards the normal at the angle φ . The opaque silicon layer reflects the light beam , which is then refracted once more at the interface of media with n 1 and n 2 . The result is a phase shift Δ φ due to the longer traveling distance ( s ) of the refracted light ( I 2 ) compared to the reflected part ( I 1 ) . The distance can be calculated with equation ( 3 . 3 ) . 𝑠 = 2𝑑 cos ( 𝜑 ) ( 3 . 3 ) The optical distance is dependent on the refractive index of the second medium n 2 ( equation ( 3 . 4 ) ) , which leads to equation ( 3 . 5 ) . 𝑠 𝑂𝑇 = 𝑛 2 ∙ 𝑠 ( 3 . 4 ) 𝑠 𝑂𝑇 = 2𝑛 2 𝑑 cos ( 𝜑 ) ( 3 . 5 ) The refraction of the light causes a phase shift , resulting in constructive and destruc - tive interference . When constructive interference arises the Δ φ is a multiple of the wavelength , described by equation ( 3 . 6 ) . 3 Materials and Methods 24 𝛥𝜑 ( 𝜆 ) = 2π ∙ 𝑂𝑇 𝜆 cos ( 𝜑 ) ( 3 . 6 ) The optical thickness changes by adsorption of molecules on the surface as it is the product of n and d ( equation ( 3 . 7 ) ) . Since the refractive indices of silicon dioxide and lipid or protein layers are similar , 72 it hence enables to measure the molecule adsorp - tion by detection of the optical thickness changes . 𝑂𝑇 = 𝑛 ∙ 𝑑 ( 3 . 7 ) In case of a perpendicular incident light causing α = φ = 0° , equation ( 3 . 7 ) simplifies to equation ( 3 . 8 ) . This allows to monitor the optical thickness change via phase shift detection . 𝛥𝜑 ( 𝜆 ) = 2π ∙ 𝑂𝑇 𝜆 ( 3 . 8 ) Evaluation of the data A reflectivity spectrum was determined by the program Spectra Suite ( Ocean Optics Inc . , Dunedin , FL , USA ) with the reference ( I r ) and the dark ( I d ) spectrum according to equation ( 3 . 9 ) . The reference spectrum is recorded at nearly complete reflectivity against a silver - coated surface . Measurement of the light intensity without illumina - tion yielded the dark spectrum . 𝑅 ( 𝜆 ) = 𝐼 m − 𝐼 d 𝐼 r − 𝐼 d ( 3 . 9 ) I m is the measured intensity spectrum . The reflectivity is described with the Fresnel reflectivity coefficients r 1 and r 2 in equation ( 3 . 10 ) .

This in turn enables the time - resolved tracking of OT ( equation ( 3 . 12 ) ) . 𝑅 ( 𝜆 , 𝑂𝑇 ) = 𝑟 12 + 2𝑟 1 𝑟 2 cos ( 4𝜋𝜆 𝑂𝑇 ) + 𝑟 22 1 + 2𝑟 1 𝑟 2 cos ( 4𝜋𝜆 𝑂𝑇 ) + 𝑟 12 𝑟 22 ( 3 . 12 ) Experimental procedure The hydrophilic or hydrophobic functionalized silicon wafers ( cf . chapter 3 . 2 . 2 ) were implemented into a RIfS chamber , consisting of an aluminum bottom , an acrylic glass cap and a rubber ring to seal the chamber ( Figure 3 . 6 ) . Figure 3 . 6 : Schematic illustration of a RIfS chamber . A silicon wafer is mounted between an acrylic glass cap and an alumina plate . In and outflow of liquids is realized by inlets in the acrylic glass cap . Then the optical fiber is placed in the indentation of the acrylic glass cap . The flow in and out of the chamber was conducted via inlets inside the acrylic glass cap , which enabled a controlled addition of liquids . A fanned optical fiber was ortho - gonally mounted to the wafers . This fanned fiber is made of one light - collecting fiber , which is surrounded by six emitting fibers connected to a tungsten halogen lamp ( λ = 350 - 950 nm ) . The reflected and refracted light of the 1 mm 2 lighted area is de - tected by a UV / Vis - silicon - CCD - detector ( 2048 Pixel ) . 3 Materials and Methods 26 Every two seconds a reflectivity spectrum was recorded with the software Spectra Suite and then tracked with a MATLAB script using equation ( 3 . 12 ) written by Dr . I . Mey ( Georg - August - University Göttingen ) . For the experiment , the system was first rinsed with citrate buffer , which was defined as the baseline for the determination of the optical thickness changes . Then SUVs were added , leading to an increase of the optical thickness . This increase indicates the spreading and formation of a lipid bilayer ( hydrophilic ) or monolayer ( hydrophobic ) . After a plateau was reached , PBS was rinsed through the chambers to remove non - spread SUVs . Then , BSA ( 1 mg / mL ) was added for surface passivation , preventing possible unspecific interactions of ENTH with defects in the membranes . Before pro - tein addition , the system was again rinsed with PBS , the same buffer in which the ENTH domain is solved . For the investigation of the influence of PIP 2 on the ENTH - membrane interaction , measurements with a single protein addition with a concen - tration of 1 µM were implemented . Isotherms with gradual protein additions ( c ( ENTH ) = 0 . 1 - 5 µM ) ) were performed to detect the influence of the charged lipid Phosphatidylserine ( PS ) on the ENTH binding affinity . Due to the interaction of the membrane / surface and the added protein , an increase of the optical thickness was monitored . When a plateau was reached , PBS was rinsed through the system to detect the protein dissociation process or more protein was added to obtain a Langmuir ad - sorption isotherm . 3 . 3 . 3 Fluorescence microscopy Fluorescence microscopic techniques were used to image solid - supported mem - branes and adhered GUVs . This non - invasive method bases on the physical phenom - enon of fluorescence . After the absorption of light , fluorophores emit the light with a longer wavelength ( stokes shift ) . Separation with filters and mirrors allows the col - lection of the emitted light , excluding illumination light . There are different types of fluorescence microscopy setups , which enable to image labeled biological structures in high resolution . In the next chapters two types of microscopes are described in more detail . 3 Materials and Methods 27 3 . 3 . 3 . 1 Confocal laser scanning microscope The confocal laser scanning microscope ( CLSM ) uses a single laser beam , which is fo - cused onto a specimen . As the emitted light is filtered through a pinhole rejecting out - of - focus light , the sample is scanned point - wise . Therefore , higher axial resolutions can be reached compared to an epifluorescence microscope . 73 Due to the illumination of a small focal volume of the sample moreover the bleaching of fluorophores is re - duced . In Figure 3 . 7 an illustration of the setup and the light path of a CLSM is shown . Figure 3 . 7 : Schematic illustration of a confocal laser scanning microscope setup . The fluorophore of the specimen is excited by a laser . The emitted light ( red ) passes the dichroic mirror and is focused to the detector via a confocal pinhole , which enables to reject out - of - focus light ( blue dotted lines ) . The resolution of a CLSM using very small pinholes can be determined by the full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) of the point spread function according to Abbes law , enabling lateral and axial resolutions in the range of 200 - 250 and 570 - 950 nm 74 when the specimen was exited with visible light ( equations ( 3 . 13 ) and ( 3 . 14 ) ) . 3 Materials and Methods 28 𝜆̅ is described by the wavelength of the emitted ( λ em ) and the exited light ( λ ex ) with √𝜆 em ∙ 𝜆 ex , n is the refractive index of the imaged medium and NA the numerical ap - erture of the objective . The CLSM setup was used to image solid - supported membranes as well as to deter - mine diffusion coefficients of these membranes via fluorescence recovery after pho - tobleaching experiments . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) is a method to determine the la - teral mobility of labeled molecules . First , the fluorescence intensity of a defined cir - cular region of interest ( ROI , Figure 3 . 8 , red circle ) of the sample is measured . Subse - quently , fluorophores in this region are irreversibly bleached by a laser beam . As far as the lipids are mobile , the fluorescence intennsity in the ROI increases after a time due to diffusion of unbleached molecule into the ROI and diffusion of bleached mole - cules out of the ROI . In Figure 3 . 8 a typical FRAP experiment is illustrated . 𝑑 FWHM , lateral = 0 . 37 𝜆̅̅ 𝑁𝐴 ( 3 . 13 ) 𝑑 FWHM , axial = 0 . 67 𝜆̅̅ 𝑛 − √𝑛 2 − 𝑁𝐴 2 ( 3 . 14 ) 3 Materials and Methods 29 Figure 3 . 8 : Schematic illustration of a FRAP experiment . ( A ) At the beginning the fluorescence intensity I i in a circular region of interest ( ROI , red circle ) is detected . The lipids are distributed homogenously ( B ) Bleaching of labeled lipids in the ROI leads to the decrease of the fluorescence intensity to I o in corresponding time trace ( E ) . ( C ) Due to lateral mobility labeled lipids diffuse out of the ROI and non - labeled lipids into the ROI , which increases the fluorescence intensity in the ROI . ( D ) At the end the a new equilibrium of the fluorescence intensity I eq is reached . 75 The graph in Figure 3 . 8 E shows an exponential increase of the intensity after bleach - ing of labeled lipids in the ROI . The time dependent fluorescence intensity I ( t ) can be described with the fluorescence intensity directly after the bleaching I 0 , the intensity at the new equilibrium I eq , the time t and the time constant of the fluorescence reco - very t F ( equation ( 3 . 15 ) ) . 76 , 77 𝐼 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐼 eq − ( 𝐼 eq − 𝐼 0 ) ∙ exp ( −𝑡 𝑡 F ) ( 3 . 15 ) The time constant is related to the characteristic diffusion time τ D by equation ( 3 . 16 ) . 3 Materials and Methods 30 With the radius of the ROI ( r ) and τ D it is possible to calculate the diffusion coefficient D using equation ( 3 . 17 ) . Dependent on the interactions of the substrate and the membrane , a certain amount of the lipids remains immobile . The mobile fraction F m can be determined with equa - tion ( 3 . 18 ) . I i describes the initial fluorescence intensity before bleaching . The diffusion coefficients and the mobile fraction were determined with a MatLab Script written by Jönsson et al . using a Hankel transformation . 78 Experimental procedure The experiments were performed with an upright microscope ( LSM 880 Examiner , Carl Zeiss , Jena , GER ) equipped with a water immersion objective ( WPlan - Apochro - mat 63x , NA 1 . 0 , Carl Zeiss , Jena , GER ) . SUVs were prepared as described in chapter 3 . 2 . 1 . To enable the visualization of the membranes , a fluorophore was incorporated . In this thesis the lipid bound dye TxR was used . TxR was excited at 561 nm and de - tected at 570 - 680 nm . After functionalization of the substrates ( cf . chapter 3 . 2 . 2 ) they were implemented into Teflon chambers . Depending on the functionalization , spread - ing of SUVs for 1 h resulted in mono - ( hydrophobic ) or bilayers ( hydrophilic ) . Non - spread vesicles were removed by rinsing with citrate buffer ( 3x ) and PBS ( 3x ) . Sub - sequently , imaging and FRAP experiments were performed . 𝜏 D = ln ( 0 . 5 ) ∙ ( −𝑡 F ) ( 3 . 16 ) 𝐷 = 𝑟 2 4𝜏 D ( 3 . 17 ) 𝐹 m = 𝐼 eq − 𝐼 0 𝐼 i − 𝐼 0 ( 3 . 18 ) 3 Materials and Methods 31 3 . 3 . 3 . 2 Spinning Disc Compared to a conventional CLSM a spinning disc confocal laser microscopy ( SDCLM ) has the advantage that imaging works much faster due to multiple beam illumination . This is realized with two synchronically rotating discs . Excitation light first passes the micro lens array disc and is then focused onto the sample by a second Nipkow disc with multiple ( about 1000 - 20000 ) spirally arranged pinholes ( 50 µm ) . The SDCLM setup was used to image z - stacks of biotinylated vesicles adhered to a NeutrAvidin functionalized surface . In Figure 3 . 9 the setup of a SDCLM is illustrated . Figure 3 . 9 : Setup of a spinning disc . Laser light is directed to a specimen by the micro lens disc passing through pinholes of a second disc ( Nipkow disc ) . The emitted light is focused to the beamsplitter by the objective lens through the Nipkow disc pinholes , where the light is directed to the detector , passing a barrier filter and a tube lens . The figure was modified according to Gleisner . 79 Experimental procedure The measurements were performed using an upright SDCLM ( spinning disc : Yoko - gawa CSU - X , Rota Yokogaa GmbH & Co . KG , Wehr , stand : custom made Olympus Deutschland GmbH , Hamburg ) equipped with an iXON 897Ultra camera ( Andor Tech - nology Ltd . , Belfast , UK ) and a water immersion objective ( CFI Plan 100XW 100x , NA 1 . 1 , Nikon , Düsseldorf ) . The dye Atto488 - DPPE , incorporated in the GUVs , was ex - cited at 488 nm . A LP496 ET filter was used to detect the emission of the fluorophore . 3 Materials and Methods 32 Adhered GUVs were prepared as described in chapter 3 . 2 . 2 . The use of a humidity chamber avoided the evaporation of the buffer and consequently ensured iso - osmo - lar conditions during the experimental time . A series of z - stacks of the adhered GUVs were recorded with 5 - 13 % laser power and with an exposure time of 20 ms . The dis - tance between the slices was adjusted to 150 - 250 nm . The radii of the GUVs and the contact areas of the GUVs with the surface were determined with ImageJ . 3 . 3 . 4 Atomic force microscopy Binning et al . first introduced the atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) technique in 1985 . 80 It enabled scanning of non - conductive probes under physiological conditions with a high lateral ( 1 . 0 nm ) and axial ( 0 . 1 nm ) resolution . 81 Hence it is well suitable for the analysis of biological systems , like e . g . receptor - ligand interactions . 82 In this work AFM was used to analyze surface topographies of solid - supported membranes and ENTH clusters . Principle of an AFM A cantilever with a sharp tip is moved over a sample by x - y piezo actuators . Further - more , a z - piezo actuator can approach the cantilever towards the sample until attrac - tive or repulsive interactions of the sample and the cantilever lead to the deflection of it . The deflection is detected by a laser beam , which is reflected by the cantilever surface as well as by a mirror and then directed to a four quadrant diode . Lateral or vertical deflection results in the shift of the laser beam on the diode . Hence the deflec - tion of the cantilever against the sample position allows to get a topographic image of the sample surface . The setup of an AFM is illustrated in Figure 3 . 10 . 3 Materials and Methods 33 Figure 3 . 10 : Schematic illustration of an AFM setup . The piezos move the cantilever on the surface . A light beam , which is directed to the cantilever , is reflected and directed to the four quadrant photodi - ode , detecting the deflection of the cantilever . In AFM different imaging modes can be applied . In this work the contact mode was used , where the tip is in close contact to the sample . The contact mode can be realized in constant height or constant force . In case of constant force a topographic image can be illustrated due to the piezo element regulation . This mode appeared to be best suited for imaging ENTH clusters on solid - supported membranes . Besides topographical information , AFM is utilized for the determination of mechan - ical properties of samples by force - distance curves . This method is often used to measure the elastic characteristics of biological systems . 83 Thereby , the force can be obtained by the vertical cantilever defection Z c and the spring constant of the cantile - ver ( k ) by Hooke’s law ( equation ( 3 . 19 ) ) . 84 𝐹 = 𝑘 ∙ 𝑍 c ( 3 . 19 ) For force - distance curves the position of the piezo Z p and the cantilever deflection Z c are converted into force F and distance D ( Figure 3 . 11 B ) . Applying a fit to the com - pliance region yielded the slope , which is equal to the conversion factor of the canti - lever defection and the detector signal . The tip - sample distance can be obtained by equation ( 3 . 20 ) . 85 𝐷 = 𝑍 p + 𝑍 c ( 3 . 20 ) 3 Materials and Methods 34 Force - distance curves were detected at single sample positions and predefined forces of 6 - 8 nN to obtain breakthrough forces which provides the membrane thicknesses as they are correlated ( Figure 3 . 11 ) . Figure 3 . 11 : Schematic illustration of a signal versus piezo position ( A ) and a force - distance curve ( B ) . During approach ( blue ) no interactions of cantilever and sample occur ( I ) . Due to attractive forces the cantilever gets in contact with the sample and the measured force suddenly decreases ( II ) . Further approach leads to increase of the force ( IV ) . At high predefined forces the cantilever can break through the lipid bilayer resulting in a second drop of the force ( III ) . Until the retraction energy exceeds the adhesion energy the cantilever stays in contact to the surface during retraction ( red , V ) . At the end the baseline is reached again as no contact of cantilever and sample is present . By the approach of the cantilever the force suddenly decreases due to attractive elec - trostatic or van - der - Waals interactions . As the cantilever is in contact further ap - proach results in the increase of F until a predefined value . At high predefined forces a small drop in the approach force - distance curve can appear ( cantilever tip breaks through the bilayer ) , enabling the determination of the membrane thickness . In the force - distance plot the membrane thickness is the distance between the decrease of F and the point where F begins to rise again ( cf . Figure 3 . 11 B ) . 86 Then retraction of the cantilever leads to the decrease of F . An even negative force value can be reached when adhesion causes cantilever bending . With further retraction the cantilever loses the contact as the retraction force exceeds the adhesion force . 3 Materials and Methods 35 Experimental setup For the supported lipid bilayers ( SLBs ) previously described FRAP and CLSM experi - ments ( cf . chapter 3 . 3 . 3 . 1 ) were done to verify the mobility of the membranes . Meas - urements were performed using a JPK Nanowizard 4 ( JPK Instruments , Berlin , GER ) . After fixing the cantilever to a glass holder and implementing both into the AFM head , the laser was directed to the tip of the cantilever to get a maximal signal . The exact spring constant of the cantilever was determined by measuring the thermal noise spectrum . 87 As all settings were adjusted , micrographs of SLBs were taken to analyze the surface topography before and after protein adsorption . SLBs were prepared as described in chapter 3 . 2 . 2 . Measurements were done in contact mode using BL - AC40TS - C2 canti - levers ( BioLever mini , f = 85 . 4 - 139 . 1 kHz , k = 0 . 03 - 0 . 12 N / m , Olympus ) . First of all break - through experiments were performed to measure the membrane thickness as it can be derived from the break - through force . Besides FRAP experiments , this en - sured that a bilayer with a thickness of about 4 nm was formed , which is typical for a bilayer . 88 Next , an area of 10 x 10 µm 2 of the SLBs was imaged . After incubation with 1 µM ENTH or ENTH R114A mutant for 2h at RT , the surface was scanned again . Roughnesses ( root - mean - square , rms ) were determined with the integrated JPK Data Processing software . The protein height and occupancy were analyzed using a MatLab script written by Dr . Ingo Mey ( Georg - August Universität Göttingen ) . To detect the membrane and the pro - tein a threshold was set . Protein adsorption was identified by a 2D peak detection function , which marked the local maxima . A histogram out of the maxima was created and fitting a normal distribution yielded the protein height . 3 Materials and Methods 36 3 . 3 . 5 Langmuir - Blodgett trough Monolayers have the advantage of a homogenous lipid distribution without the feasi - ble asymmetry between two leaflets of bilayers . One possibility to generate monolay - ers without the necessity of a solid support is the Langmuir - Blodgett trough . This technique thus enables to prevent interactions of lipids with substrate surfaces . Be - sides the determination of lipid concentrations and properties , also the compressibi - lity of monolayers can be analyzed . Furthermore , single or multiple monolayers on solid supports ( so called Langmuir films ) can be generated with this technique . Studies with spread lipids on water already were done by Agnes Pockels in 1882 . 89 However , the technique as it is known and used today was extended and improved by Irving Langmuir and Katherine Blodgett in 1917 and 1934 . The Langmuir - Blodgett trough or film balance consists of a temperature controlled Teflon trough , Teflon barriers and a microbalance system with a Wilhelmy plate . 90 These barriers can be moved by a control system to change the trough area and ena - ble the compression or expansion of spread films ( Figure 3 . 12 ) . 3 Materials and Methods 37 Figure 3 . 12 : Schematic illustration of a Langmuir - Blodgett trough and a typical surface pressure - area per molecule isotherm . Due to compression the area per molecule gets smaller and the lipids change their orientation . The transition from a gas - like phase to a liquid - expanded state occurs . Further com - pression leads to a solid - like or untilted LC state via a liquid condensed ( LC ) . The Figure was modified according to M Larsen . 91 With a large trough area the lipid molecules were comparable to a 2D gas . 92 , 93 By re - ducing the area the lipids switch to a liquid - expanded ( LE ) state . At a certain surface pressure a co - existence region of the LE and the liquid condensed ( LC ) phase can oc - cur , induced by a first - order transition , followed by the LC state , where the lipids are highly ordered . Further compression leads to the collapse of the film due to too high packing densities . Here the appearance of multilayers or the formation of micelles are possible . Determination of the surface pressure When amphiphilic molecules , like lipids , get in contact with a water - air interface a rearrangement of the lipids occurs . The hydrophilic head groups will get in contact 3 Materials and Methods 38 with the water ( subphase ) and the lipophilic tail protrudes into the air . This perpen - dicular alignment is associated with the decrease of the free energy of the system . 94 An enrichment of the molecules causes the favored expansion of the interface with an interface or surface pressure π . The surface tension of the water 𝛾 H 2 O ( 72 . 5 mN / m ) 95 counteracts , resulting in a reduced surface tension . The surface pressure is hence the difference of the surface tension without 𝛾 H 2 O and with the lipid film 𝛾 Film ( equation ( 3 . 21 ) ) . 96 𝛾 Film = 𝛾 H 2 O − 𝜋 ↔ 𝜋 = 𝛾 H 2 O − 𝛾 Film ( 3 . 21 ) The resulting surface tension 𝛾 Film was determined with the Wilhelmy plate method . Figure 3 . 13 shows the principle of this technique . Figure 3 . 13 : Wetting principle of a Wilhelmy plate . A force F acts on the Wilhelmy plate , which is pro - portional to the wetted perimeter L = ( 2l + 2b ) . l and b describe the plate width and thickness . The plate is wetted at an angle Θ . By wetting of a Wilhelmy plate a force F acts on this plate according to equation ( 3 . 22 ) . 𝐹 = 𝛾 ∙ 𝐿 ∙ cos 𝛩 ↔ 𝛾 = 𝐹 𝐿 ∙ cos 𝛩 ( 3 . 22 ) This force correlates with the surface tension , the wetted perimeter L = ( 2 l + 2 b ) ( cf . Figure 3 . 13 ) and the contact angle ( Θ ) . Wilhelmy plates are often made of filter papers , ensuring complete wetting ( Θ = 0° ) , which simplifies the equation ( 3 . 22 ) to : 3 Materials and Methods 39 𝛾 = 𝐹 𝐿 ⟶ 𝛾 Film = 𝐹 𝐿 ( 3 . 23 ) The calculation of the surface tension 𝛾 , or more exactly the surface tension with the film 𝛾 Film , then enables the determination of the surface pressure π ( cf . equation ( 3 . 21 ) ) , which is displayed on the control system . Experimental procedure Before the experiment was started , the trough and the barriers were cleaned with Mucasol for 15 min . In this time the thermostat ( 20 °C ) and the software were turned on and the filter paper was soaked in ultrapure water . After rinsing with ultrapure water ( trough 4 times , barriers 10 times ) , the trough was filled with 120 mL sub - phase . Lipid concentrations were determined in ultrapure water and the investiga - tion of the monolayer stability was performed in PBS . For measurements with a pro - tein trough , first 50 mL PBS were added . The protein trough was then fixed with screws and further 70 mL PBS were filled into the middle of the trough . The barriers were fixed and the filter paper was dipped into the subphase to get a slight contact . During this contact the Offset was adjusted to 0 mN / m . Without contact to the water , the Calibration - screw was set to 72 . 75 mN / m ( 𝛾 H 2 O ) . 95 This procedure was repeated three times for precise calibration . The lipid mixture , dissolved in chloroform , was carefully added to the subphase with a Hamilton syringe , which was rinsed three times with chloroform before use . The system was then equilibrated for 15 min to remove the chloroform by vaporization . After adjusting the barrier velocity ( 4 . 7 mm 2 / s ) and starting the measurement in the software , the barrier motors ( setup : “auto” ) were turned on . For determination of the lipid concentrations via an isotherm the trough area was compressed up to a surface pressure of π = 25 mN / m . For the isotherms of the lipid mixtures the surface pressure was set to π = 35 mN / m . To investigate the monolayer stability of the used lipid mixtures a maximum surface pressure of π = 30 mN / m was adjusted . When this surface pressure was reached , the barrier motors were turned 3 Materials and Methods 40 off to get a constant trough area . The surface pressure is then plotted against the time to see if the monolayer remained stable over one hour . Protein insertion experiments were done with a special protein trough ( Figure 3 . 14 ) . This protein trough enables the insertion of ENTH into the subphase to investigate the surface activity in a smaller volume ( V = 2 mL ) . Figure 3 . 14 : Schema of the used protein trough with a capacity of 2 mL , confined by small Teflon bar - riers . Through a small hole protein can be inserted into the subphase . For this experiment different initial surface pressures were set . When the desired pressure was achieved , the barrier motors were turned off and small Teflon barriers were fixed into the pre - built notches . As the monolayer is disturbed during the inset of the small barriers , the system was equilibrated for 5 - 10 min until no more change of the surface pressure was observed . Then 1 µM of the ENTH - domain was added to the subphase and subsequently distributed with a Hamilton syringe . The measure - ments were recorded until a maximum of the surface pressure change was reached . In this work following lipid mixtures were used to analyze the ENTH - PIP 2 interaction with the film balance technique .  POPC / POPE 80 : 20  POPC / POPE / PIP 2 79 : 20 : 1  POPC / POPE / PIP 2 75 : 20 : 5  POPC / POPE / PIP 2 70 : 20 : 10  POPC / POPE / POPS 60 : 20 : 20  POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 55 : 20 : 20 : 5 4 Results 41 4 R ESULTS In this work , the impact of negatively charged lipids phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) and phosphatidylserine ( PS ) on the interaction of the epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain and membranes was analyzed . First , the bind - ing behavior on solid supported bi - and monolayers was investigated by means of reflectometric interference spectroscopy ( RIfS ) . Furthermore , atomic force micros - copy ( AFM ) experiments were performed to obtain the surface topology of mem - branes after ENTH binding . Finally , the penetration capability of ENTH and its influ - ence on membrane tension were determined using the Langmuir - Blodgett technique and spinning disc confocal laser microscopy ( SDCLM ) . 4 . 1 Influence of the PIP 2 concentration on the ENTH binding to solid supported lipid membranes In the clathrin - mediated endocytosis the receptor lipid PIP 2 is necessary for the re - cruitment of ENTH to the membrane and consequently involved in one key step of this process ( cf . chapter 1 . 1 ) . 8 , 21 , 25 It is predicted that ENTH binds PIP 2 in a 1 : 1 stoi - chiometry , 7 which would assume a direct correlation of the PIP 2 content and the amount of bound protein . The impact of PIP 2 and especially its concentration on the ENTH - membrane interactions is still unexplored . To analyze how the concentration of the receptor lipid influences the protein occupancy on PIP 2 doped membranes , RIfS experiments were performed . Therefore , the amount of bound protein on solid sup - ported bilayers and monolayers at different PIP 2 concentrations was determined . 4 Results 42 4 . 1 . 1 Formation of solid - supported lipid bilayers on silicon dioxide Since the formation of a homogenous and planar membrane is required to investigate the ENTH binding by means of RIfS , the spreading of small unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) on hydrophilic silicon dioxide ( SiO 2 ) was considered first . When vesicles of POPC / PIP 2 with different receptor lipid concentrations ( 0 - 10 mol % ) were added to a hydrophilic SiO 2 wafer , they spread on the surface , resulting in a lipid bilayer . During this spreading process the increase of the optical thickness ( Δ OT ) was observed , in - dicating the successful bilayer formation . In Figure 4 . 1 the formation of a POPC ( 100 mol % , A ) and a POPC / PIP 2 ( 90 : 10 , B ) bilayer are shown . Figure 4 . 1 : Exemplary plots of the change in optical thickness vs . the time during vesicle spreading of ( A ) pure POPC and ( B ) POPC / PIP 2 ( 90 : 10 ) SUVs onto hydrophilic silicon dioxide wafers . During spreading of SUVs the optical thickness increases until a plateau is reached , indicating the successful formation of a bilayer . The baseline was generated by rinsing the system with citrate buffer at a pH of 4 . 8 , which reduced the negative charge of the PIP 2 and the SiO 2 surface . In previous stud - ies , it was shown that these conditions ( ions , pH ) improve the spreading of PIP 2 - containing SUVs and hence the bilayer formation . 97 After rinsing with PBS to remove non - spread vesicles , the surface was passivated with BSA to avoid defects in the bilayer . The system was then rinsed with PBS again , yielding the Δ OT after vesicle spreading ( Figure 4 . 2 ) . 4 Results 43 Figure 4 . 2 : Time - trace of the spreading process of POPC / PIP 2 - SUVs , followed by rinsing with PBS and BSA . PBS was added to remove adhered , non - spread vesicles and BSA for passivation . The optical thick - ness of the membrane ( Δ OT M ) is determined by the difference of Δ OT 2 - Δ OT 1 . Here an example of the bilayer formation on hydrophilic SiO 2 is shown . The Δ OT M of a monolayer is calculated analogously . To obtain the membrane thickness ( Δ OT M ) the difference of the Δ OT before ( baseline , Δ OT 1 ) and after ( Δ OT 2 ) SUV spreading were calculated with equation ( 4 . 1 ) . Δ𝑂𝑇 M = Δ𝑂𝑇 2 − Δ𝑂𝑇 1 ( 4 . 1 ) From the optical thickness of the membrane ( Δ OT M ) the physical thickness d M could be determined with equation ( 3 . 7 ) . The lipid bilayer formation was investigated for different receptor lipid concentra - tions in the vesicles (  ( PIP 2 = 0 - 10 mol % ) ) . In Table 4 . 1 the determined values for Δ OT M and d M were collected . 4 Results 44 Table 4 . 1 : Averaged optical and physical thicknesses of the POPC / PIP 2 lipid bilayers with the corre - sponding standard deviations .

To verify that the formed lipid bilayers are homogenous and mobile , additionally fluorophore labeled bilayers were investigated by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) . Solid supported lipid bilayers composed of POPC , PIP 2 ( 1 - 10 mol % ) and the lipid coupled fluorophore Texas Red ® 1 , 2 - dihexadecanoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoetanolamine ( TxR ) were prepared as described in chapter 3 . 2 . 2 . Then FRAP - experiments were performed to obtain the diffusion coefficients ( D ) of TxR in the solid supported bilayers ( cf . chapter 3 . 3 . 3 . 1 ) . In Figure 4 . 3 an exemplary FRAP experiment on POPC / PIP 2 / TxR ( 89 . 5 : 10 : 5 ) is shown . 4 Results 45 Figure 4 . 3 : ( A ) Fluorescence images of a FRAP experiment and ( B ) the corresponding time - trace of the normalized fluorescence intensity on a POPC / PIP 2 / TxR ( 89 . 5 : 10 : 0 . 5 ) bilayer . After bleaching of a re - gion of interest ( ROI , red circle , t = 2 s ) the fluorescence intensity increases , reaching a plateau after 20 s . Due to the immobile fraction of TxR in the bilayer , the fluorescence intensity does not reach the fluorescence intensity value at t = 0 . In all samples ( 1 - 10 mol % PIP 2 ) the fluorescence of TxR was distributed equally , in - dicating the formation of a homogenous bilayer without obvious defects . A region of interest ( ROI ) of the bilayer was bleached and the fluorescence recovery was re - corded . All membranes were mobile as the fluorescence intensity increased over time . The diffusion coefficients were determined using a MatLab Scipt from Jönssen et al . 78 In Table 4 . 2 the determined diffusion coefficients and the mobile fractions are listed . 4 Results 46 Table 4 . 2 : Mean values of the diffusion coefficients D and the mobile fractions F m of TxR in lipid bilayers with corresponding standard deviations yielded by FRAP experiments . n is the amount of performed FRAP experiments .

Within the standard deviation the values were similar and did not show a trend with increasing receptor lipid concentration . Considering the mobile fractions of the lipid bilayers the PIP 2 concentration seemed to have a minor influence . The mobile fraction generally slightly decreased from ( 99 ± 1 ) % for 1 mol % PIP 2 to ( 90 ± 3 ) % for 10 mol % PIP 2 . The values were significantly different ( Mann - Whitney U test , p < 0 . 01 ) . Together , the results indicate successful formation of homogenous and mobile lipid bilayers . 4 . 1 . 2 Formation of solid - supported lipid monolayers on silicon dioxide Supported lipid bilayers are a versatile tool to investigate membrane - protein interac - tion as they exhibit high mechanical stability . However , the substrate surface can in - fluence the lipid distribution within the both leaflets 99 , 100 . This can have an effect on the accessibility of specific receptor lipids on the upper leaflet of the SLBs , necessary for protein binding . To investigate if the PIP 2 is asymmetrically distributed on sup - ported bilayers and the ENTH binding is influenced , RIfS experiments with monolay - ers were done . In monolayers the receptor lipid should be distributed homogenously and completely accessible for ENTH binding due to the missing second leaflet . 4 Results 47 For precise binding studies of ENTH the formation of a stable monolayer is required . SUVs composed of POPC and PIP 2 ( 0 - 10 mol % ) were spread on hydrophobic func - tionalized silicon dioxide substrates ( cf . chapter 3 . 2 . 2 ) , leading to an increase of the Δ OT . Figure 4 . 4 shows exemplary RIfS time - traces of the spreading process of POPC ( 100 mol % ) and POPC / PIP 2 ( 90 : 10 ) vesicles on these substrates . Figure 4 . 4 : Exemplary RIfS time - traces of the vesicle spreading on hydrophobic functionalized silicon dioxide . Pure POPC ( A ) and POPC / PIP 2 ( 90 : 10 , B ) SUVs were added after a baseline with citrate buffer was observed , resulting in the formation of a lipid monolayer indicated by the Δ OT increase of about 2 - 3 nm . After the formation of a baseline with the citrate buffer ( cf . chapter 4 . 1 . 1 ) in either case the addition of SUVs led to the Δ OT increase up to 2 . 1 - 2 . 6 nm indicating that the bilayer was formed successfully . First , Δ OT increased fast , then slighter reaching a plateau . The lipid monolayer formation was investigated for different PIP 2 concentra - tions c ( PIP 2 = 0 - 10 mol % ) . In Table 4 . 3 the determined values for Δ OT and d M were listed . 4 Results 48 Table 4 . 3 : The optical and physical thicknesses of the POPC / PIP 2 lipid monolayers with receptor lipid concentration ranging from 0 - 10 mol % .

The experiments showed no significant influence of the PIP 2 concentration on the membrane thickness within the standard deviations . Since interactions of membrane layers with the substrate surface can occur , which influence the membrane mobility , 99 diffusion coefficients of TxR in the lipid monolay - ers were determined by FRAP . Fluorescence images of POPC / PIP 2 / TxR monolayers with different PIP 2 concentrations ( 1 – 10 mol % ) revealed an even distribution of the fluorophore , indicating that homogenous monolayers were formed . Rarely occurring small bright spots were assigned to adhered vesicles . In Figure 4 . 5 exemplary fluo - rescence images of a FRAP experiment on POPC / PIP 2 / TxR ( 89 . 5 / 10 / 0 . 5 ) and the cor - responding time - trace of the normalized fluorescence intensity are illustrated . 4 Results 49 Figure 4 . 5 : ( A ) Fluorescence images of a FRAP experiment and ( B ) the corresponding time - trace of the normalized fluorescence intensity on a POPC / PIP 2 / TxR ( 89 . 5 : 10 : 0 . 5 ) monolayer . After bleaching of a ROI ( red circle , t = 2 s ) the fluorescence intensity increases , reaching a plateau after 40 s . Due to the immobile fraction of TxR in the bilayer , the fluorescence intensity does not reach the fluorescence in - tensity value at t = 0 . Bleaching of a ROI led to the decrease of the fluorescence intensity ( Figure 4 . 5 B ) . By evaluating the fluorescence recovery with the MatLab Scrip of Jönsson et al . 78 the dif - fusion coefficients and the mobile fractions ( F m ) of the fluorophore were determined ( Table 4 . 4 ) . 4 Results 50 Table 4 . 4 : Mean values of the diffusion coefficients D and the mobile fractions F m of the fluorophores in lipid monolayers with corresponding standard deviations yielded by FRAP experiments . n is the amount of performed FRAP experiments . Lipid composition POPC / PIP 2 / TxR Diffusion coefficient D / µm2 / s Mobile fraction F m / % n 98 . 5 : 1 : 0 . 5 0 . 36 ± 0 . 02 98 ± 1 5 97 . 5 : 2 : 0 . 5 0 . 37 ± 0 . 03 98 ± 1 6 94 . 5 : 5 : 0 . 5 0 . 36 ± 0 . 03 95 ± 2 5 92 . 5 : 7 : 0 . 5 0 . 41 ± 0 . 02 98 . 0 ± 0 . 1 6 91 . 5 : 8 : 0 . 5 0 . 42 ± 0 . 02 98 ± 3 6 89 . 5 : 10 : 0 . 5 0 . 41 ± 0 . 02 98 ± 8 6 The diffusion coefficient of TxR in all monolayers was calculated to be D = 0 . 4 + 0 . 1 µm 2 / s ( n = 34 ) . Moreover , mobile fractions of F m = 98 ± 2 % ( n = 34 ) were determined . For both values no influence of the receptor lipid content was observed . However these results indicate that the hydrophobic substrate surface affects the lat - eral diffusion of artificial membranes as the bilayer showed higher diffusion coeffi - cient values ( cf . section 4 . 1 . 1 ) . 4 . 1 . 3 Analysis of the ENTH binding on lipid mono - and bilayers It is known that the ENTH domain binds specifically to PIP 2 , 8 , 23 but the effect of the receptor lipid concentration on this binding is poorly investigated yet . Furthermore also the substrate seems to have a significant influence on the lipid distribution 99 and mobility and consequently on the protein adsorption to membranes . Therefore , the binding of ENTH to POPC / PIP 2 bi - and monolayers with varying PIP 2 content was an - alyzed via RIfS experiments . After the successful bi - and monolayer formation ( cf . chapter 4 . 1 . 1 and 4 . 1 . 2 ) , 1 µM ENTH was added . In Figure 4 . 6 a schematic illustration of a whole RIfS experiment is shown . 4 Results 51 Figure 4 . 6 : Schematic illustration of a RIfS experiment . After formation of a membrane ( Δ OT 2 ) by SUV spreading , protein was added , resulting in a second increase of Δ OT . By rinsing with PBS ENTH de - sorbed from the surface , reaching a new plateau ( Δ OT 4 ) . The optical thickness of the protein ( Δ OT ENTH ) was determined with the difference of Δ OT 3 and Δ OT 2 . Addition of ENTH resulted in the increase of optical thickness . The difference of the Δ OT after protein adsorption ( Δ OT 3 ) and Δ OT 2 yielded the Δ OT of the protein ( Δ OT ENTH , equation ( 4 . 3 ) ) , which can be translated into the physical thickness of the protein at complete surface coverage ( d ENTH , equation ( 3 . 7 ) , with a refractive index n proteins = 1 . 47 72 ) . Δ𝑂𝑇 ENTH = Δ𝑂𝑇 3 − Δ𝑂𝑇 2 ( 4 . 2 ) Dissociation of the ENTH domain from the membrane , bi - or monolayer , was reached by rinsing the system with PBS . The reversibility of the ENTH binding to PIP 2 was calculated using equation ( 4 . 3 ) . Reversibility / % = Δ𝑂𝑇 3 − Δ𝑂𝑇 4 Δ𝑂𝑇 3 − Δ𝑂𝑇 2 ( 4 . 3 ) In order to show the specificity of the ENTH - PIP 2 binding , the experiments were first performed with pure POPC bi - and monolayers . In Figure 4 . 7 the time - resolved change in optical thickness during the ENTH addition is illustrated . To highlight the 4 Results 52 changes upon ENTH incubation the time and Δ OT after bi - and monolayer formation ( Δ OT 2 ) in the figures were set to zero henceforth . Figure 4 . 7 : RIfS time - trace of the ENTH incubation ( 1 µM ) to pure POPC ( A ) bi - and ( B ) monolayers . After the protein addition no increase was observed , indicating that no ENTH was bound . In both cases even after some time no increase of the optical thickness was observed ( Figure 4 . 7 ) , showing the specific binding of the ENTH domain to PIP 2 as no protein was bound in the absence of the receptor lipid . Afterwards the ENTH binding to POPC / PIP 2 mono - and bilayers dependent on the PIP 2 concentration was investi - gated . The content of the receptor lipid therefore was varied from one to ten mol % . The exemplary changes in Δ OT upon ENTH binding to POPC / PIP 2 ( 92 : 8 ) mono - and bilayers are illustrated in Figure 4 . 8 . 4 Results 53 Figure 4 . 8 : Representative time - resolved change in optical thickness observed by means of RIfS . show - ing the specific binding of 1 µM ENTH to a ( A ) bi - and ( B ) monolayer composed of POPC / PIP 2 ( 92 : 8 ) . In either case Δ OT first increased fast and then reached a plateau when ENTH was added . For the bilayer the Δ OT in the example increased up to 1 . 1 nm . Compared to that protein adsorption to the monolayer resulted in a change in Δ OT up to 2 . 0 nm , being about twice as high under the same conditions . This on the one hand shows , that PIP 2 is necessary for ENTH binding to lipid membranes ( Figure 4 . 8 ) and on the other hand proves the influence of the used membrane system ( bilayer vs . mono - layer ) on binding . Afterwards rinsing with PBS led to the decrease of Δ OT in both cases , indicating reversible binding ( Figure 4 . 8 , Table 10 . 2 ) . Subsequently further binding studies were done for the other lipid compositions ( 0 - 10 mol % ) . Based on these experiments Δ OT ENTH was calculated using equation ( 4 . 3 ) . In Figure 4 . 9 , the time - resolved change in Δ OT upon protein addition and the obtained averaged Δ OT ENTH values on bi - and monolayers are plotted for the different PIP 2 concentrations . 4 Results 54 Figure 4 . 9 : Time - resolved increase of Δ OT upon binding of 1 µM ENTH to POPC ( A ) monolayers and ( B ) bilayers doped with PIP 2 ( 0 - 10 mol % ) . ( C ) Determined maximum changes in optical thickness after ENTH addition obtained from ( A ) and ( B ) plotted against the PIP 2 content . The error bars in ( C ) are given as standard deviations . A linear fit weighted by the standard deviation was plotted trough the data . The mean values with standard deviation and the number of measurements for each lipid com - position are listed in Table 10 . 1 ( cf . Appendix ) . In both cases , the mono - and bilayer , the Δ OT ENTH increased linearly with increased receptor lipid concentration , showing the significant influence of the PIP 2 content . Under same conditions the amount of bound protein to POPC / PIP 2 monolayers was about twice as high as for the bilayers . Δ OT ENTH for the monolayers with 10 mol % PIP 2 reached a value of 2 . 2 ± 0 . 4 nm , indicating the beginning of a saturation as the values for 8 mol % ( 2 . 0 ± 0 . 3 nm ) and 10 mol % PIP 2 are quite similar within the error . For the bilayers Δ OT ENTH at 10 mol % was determined to be 1 . 2 ± 0 . 4 nm . A saturation can - not be excluded within the errors . Using equation ( 4 . 3 ) the reversibility of the ENTH binding to both membrane systems were calculated for the different PIP 2 concentrations ( Figure 4 . 10 ) . 4 Results 55 Figure 4 . 10 : Reversibility of the ENTH binding to POPC / PIP 2 bi - and monolayers as a function of the PIP 2 concentration , indicating that a high amount of the protein binds reversible to PIP 2 doped mem - branes . The mean values with standard deviation and the number of measurements for each lipid com - position are listed in Table 10 . 2 ( cf . Appendix ) 70 - 99 % of the ENTH bound reversibly to the bilayer . No trend dependent on the PIP 2 concentration was observed . Having the noise to signal ratio in mind , qualified state - ments of the Δ OT at low PIP 2 concentrations are difficult to make as the Δ OT ENTH was only 0 . 1 ±0 . 1 nm at a receptor lipid concentration of 1 mol % . This systematical error also explains the high deviations when working with low PIP 2 concentrations . Contrary to that the reversibility of the ENTH binding to monolayers showed a slight tendency . With increasing PIP 2 content the reversibility slightly decreased from 83 ±15 % ( 1 mol % ) to 68 ±4 % ( 10 mol % ) , but within the error margins the differ - ences were negligible ( Figure 4 . 10 ) . Using a Mann - Whitney U test revealed that the values are not significantly different ( p = 0 . 3 ) . In general the higher amount of bound protein to the monolayers showed that more PIP 2 was accessible in the monolayers compared to the bilayers under the same con - ditions . 4 Results 56 4 . 2 The influence of PS on the ENTH binding to PIP 2 containing solid supported lipid bilayers Not only the PIP 2 content in the membrane has an influence on the amount of bound ENTH , also other lipids showed to cause an increased protein binding . Hom et al . per - formed liposome binding assays , which evidenced the higher affinity of ENTH to SUVs composed of PC / PE / PS / C 16 - PIP 2 compared to SUVs lacking PS . 8 Moreover , B . Kroppen presented a co - sedimentation assay to show the appearance of protein homo - oligomers in liposomes in the presence of PS . 26 In this chapter the impact of PS on the binding affinity of ENTH to PIP 2 doped lipid bilayers was analyzed via RIfS . Furthermore AFM experiments were performed to in - vestigate the surface topology of bilayers after ENTH incubation . 4 . 2 . 1 Influence of PS on the bilayer formation For exact binding studies of ENTH to PS - containing lipid bilayers by means of RIfS the formation of a homogenous and mobile membrane is requisite . Since the lipid com - position was changed by adding the negatively charged lipid PS , the quality of the formed bilayer and the thickness can be influenced . Therefore , SUVs composed of POPC / POPS ( 80 : 20 ) and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) were spread on hydrophilic si - licon dioxide ( see Figure 4 . 11 ) , resulting in the Δ OT increase . In all cases SUV spread - ing was performed in citrate buffer . 4 Results 57 Figure 4 . 11 : Exemplary time - trace of ( A ) POPC / POPS ( 80 : 20 ) and ( B ) POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) ves - icles spreading on hydrophilic silicon dioxide substrates . The graphs in Figure 4 . 11 show that the formation of bilayers with both lipid compo - sition were successful . The influence of the lipid head groups on the membrane height was then investigated using equation ( 4 . 3 ) . Table 4 . 5 shows the calculated values of Δ OT M and d of POPC / POPS ( 80 : 20 ) and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 bilayers . Table 4 . 5 : Mean values of the optical and physical thicknesses of the POPC / POPS ( 80 : 20 ) and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) lipid bilayers . The errors were given as standard deviations . n describes the amount of performed experiments . Lipid composition Δ OT M / nm d / nm n POPC / POPS ( 80 : 20 ) 6 . 4 ± 0 . 3 4 . 3 ± 0 . 2 6 POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) 6 . 3 ± 0 . 2 4 . 2 ± 0 . 1 13 Like shown in Table 4 . 5 , increasing of the POPS content did not change the membrane thickness ( cf . Table 4 . 1 ) . There was also no difference in the POPC / POPS bilayer thick - ness containing or lacking PIP 2 . These results show that the negative charges of POPS and PIP 2 changed the curve shape during the bilayer formation but did not influence the membrane thickness . The lateral diffusion of TxR in the POPC / POPS and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 bilayers was measured to be D = 1 . 9± 0 . 3 µm 2 / s ( without PIP 2 ) and D = 1 . 4 ± 0 . 4 µm 2 / s ( with PIP 2 ) . Although the diffusion coefficient of TxR in the POPC / POPS / PIP 2 bilayers slightly decreased compared to POPC / POPS and POPC / PIP 2 bilayers ( 1 . 8 - 2 . 5 µm 2 / s ) , the difference got negligible within the devia - tions . 4 Results 58 Furthermore mobile fractions of F m = 86± 8 % ( POPC / PIP 2 ) and F m = 76± 4 % ( POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ) were determined . These results show that the formation of mo - bile bilayers composed of POPC / POPS and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 was successful . Moreo - ver ; no obvious defects were detected by fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 4 . 12 ) . Figure 4 . 12 : Fluorescence images of ( A ) POPC / POPS / TxR ( 79 . 5 : 20 : 0 . 5 ) and ( B ) POPC / POPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( 74 . 9 : 20 : 5 : 0 . 5 ) bilayers on silicon dioxide , showing a homogenous distribution of the fluorophore . PIP 2 is the receptor lipid for ENTH , has a negative charge of - 3 to - 5 under physiolo - gical conditions 44 and is binding in an ENTH binding pocket surrounded by positively charged amino acids . Moreover , previous studies on the ENTH - PIP 2 interaction on various membrane models obtained higher binding affinity of ENTH to PIP 2 when li - pids with the head group PS ( negatively charged ) are involved . 8 , 26 Therefore the next chapters focus on the influence of PS on the ENTH - PIP 2 interaction . 4 . 2 . 2 Influence of PS on the binding affinity of ENTH to PIP2 The influence of PS on the binding affinity of ENTH was examined with RIfS measure - ments . By addition of small unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) to hydrophilic silicon dioxide wafers , the SUVs spread on the surface . Thereby the optical thickness increased , indi - cating the successful formation of a bilayer ( cf . Section 3 . 3 . 2 ) . To investigate if ENTH also binds to the negatively charged lipid PS , ENTH was added to a POPC / POPS ( 80 : 20 ) bilayer lacking PIP 2 ( Figure 4 . 13 ) . 4 Results 59 Figure 4 . 13 : Exemplary time - trace of a RIfS blind experiment . Addition of ENTH ( 1 µM ) to a preformed POPC / POPS ( 80 : 20 ) bilayer did not show changes in the optical thickness , which proves that the ENTH binds specifically to PIP 2 and does not interact with the negative charge of PS in the absence of PIP 2 . No significant increase of Δ OT was observed when the ENTH domain was added to the POPC / POPS bilayer , showing no binding of ENTH to PS in the absence of PIP 2 . This proves the specific protein binding to its receptor lipid . Based on this , binding studies of ENTH to POPC / PIP 2 ( 95 : 5 ) and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) bilayers were per - fomed with RIfS experiments to investigate the influence of PS on the binding affinity of ENTH when PIP 2 is present . In Figure 4 . 14 representative time traces upon addition of different ENTH concentrations to these bilayers are illustrated . 4 Results 60 Figure 4 . 14 : Representative RIfS time - traces of the ENTH adsorption upon different protein concen - trations to POPC / PIP 2 bilayers in ( A ) absence and ( B ) presence of PS . The protein additions are marked by arrows . After rinsing with PBS the protein desorbed from the surface showing the reversible ENTH - PIP 2 binding . Lipid compositions : POPC / PIP 2 ( A , 95 : 5 ) , POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( B , 75 : 20 : 5 ) . For both lipid compositions the optical thickness increased with the addition of the protein domain . Higher ENTH concentrations led to increased Δ OT values . The differ - ence between the experiments were the maximum Δ OT values , which reached values of Δ OT = 1 . 3 nm at 5 . 0 µM ENTH in absence and Δ OT = 2 . 1 nm at 2 . 0 µM ENTH in pres - ence of PS , indicating a higher binding affinity of the protein to bilayers containing PIP 2 and PS . With POPC / PIP 2 bilayers five and with POPC / POPS / PIP 2 bilayers eight individual experiments were performed . The isotherms revealed a high reversible binding of ENTH to POPC / PIP 2 ( 95 : 5 ) . 96 ± 10 % of the ENTH desorbed from the mem - brane surface during rinsing with PBS . Compared to that 89 ± 3 % of the ENTH bound reversible to POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) bilayers . A Mann - Whitney U test revealed that the differences are not significant ( p = 0 . 2 ) . Based on this data the Langmuir adsorption model was used to calculate the dissoci - ation constant ( K D ) of the ENTH binding to PIP 2 - containing membranes as well as the maximum of the optical thickness after protein addition ( Δ OT ENTH , max ) . This model is in a good accordance with the used system , when the surface is homogenous , all bind - ing sites are equal as well as a monolayer is formed and when no interactions of the adjacent molecules occur . 101 , 102 Furthermore a dynamic equilibrium of the bound and free molecules is assumed . As the vesicle spreading was successful ( cf . 4 . 1 . 1 and 4 . 2 . 1 ) , indicating a homogenous membrane surface and the ENTH binding is almost 4 Results 61 completely reversible the used system seems to match these assumptions . In Figure 4 . 15 the adsorption isotherms of ENTH to POPC / PIP 2 ( 95 : 5 ) and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) bilayers are illustrated , showing the influence of the lipid composition on the binding affinity . Figure 4 . 15 : Adsorption isotherms of ENTH to POPC / PIP 2 ( 95 : 5 ) ( blue circles ) and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) ( red circles ) bilayers . The values for Δ OT ENTH , max and K D were obtained by fitting a Langmuir adsorption isotherm ( solid lines ) to the data . Non - linear regression weighted by the corresponding number of measurements that went into each concentration was carried out using a Levenberg - Mar - quardt algorithm . 103 , 104 Figure 4 . 15 shows Δ OT ENTH values after the addition of different ENTH concentrations to POPC / PIP 2 ( blue circles ) and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( red circles ) bilayers . The data was fitted with a Langmuir adsorption isotherm ( solid lines ) . Due to differ - ent numbers of data points , a non - linear regression with a Levenberg - Marquardt al - gorithm weighted by the number of realized measurements for each concentration was carried out . 103 , 104 This enabled the determination of the maximal change in opti - cal thickness after protein addition Δ OT ENTH , max and the dissociation constant K D by equation ( 4 . 4 ) . 4 Results 62 Δ𝑂𝑇 = 𝛥𝑂𝑇 ENTH , max 𝑐 𝐾 D + 𝑐 ( 4 . 4 ) When no PS was present , mean values of Δ OT ENTH , max = 1 . 6 ±0 . 1 nm and K D = 1 . 0 ±0 . 2 µM were obtained . For the POPC / POPS / PIP 2 system the mean values of Δ OT ENTH , max = 2 . 5 ±0 . 1 nm and K D = 0 . 42 ±0 . 05 µM were calculated , indicating the higher binding affinity of ENTH to bilayers containing POPS in the presence of PIP 2 . 4 . 2 . 3 Topographical analysis of ENTH cluster formation In the previous chapters the specific binding of ENTH to PIP 2 containing bilayers was shown . The topography of the substrate surface before and after protein binding was investigated by means of atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . This technique enables to obtain information about the protein organization on supported membrane mo - dels . 105 , 106 The RIfS measurements showed an increased binding affinity and a higher occupancy of ENTH when lipids with the head group PS were present in the bilayer ( cf . chapter 4 . 2 . 2 ) . Therefore the surface topographies of PIP 2 doped supported bi - layers with and without PS were analyzed . For better comparison with previous re - sults , 26 , 79 AFM experiments were performed with bilayers composed of DOPC / DOPE / PIP 2 / TxR ( 64 . 9 : 30 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) and DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( 44 . 9 : 30 : 20 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) . Fluorescently labeled supported lipid bilayers were generated as described in chapter 3 . 2 . 2 . Afterwards force - distance curves were recorded via AFM , which enabled to determine the breakthrough force and the membrane thicknesses ( cf . chapter 3 . 3 . 4 ) . The breakthrough force is the maximum vertical force at which the bilayer is able to stand before the cantilever tip breaks through the membrane . 107 In Figure 4 . 16 an exemplary force distance curve with a breakthrough event is illus - trated . 4 Results 63 Figure 4 . 16 : A representative force - distance curve measured on DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( 44 . 9 : 30 : 20 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) . The inlet shows the breakthrough event ( dashed square ) which enabled to deter - mine the breakthrough force and the membrane thickness d M Breakthrough forces were measured to be between 2 - 6 nN . Furthermore the AFM ex - periments revealed lipid bilayers with physical thicknesses of d = 3 . 9±0 . 8 nm ( with - out PS ) and d = 3 . 7 ± 07 nm ( with PS ) . Also the FRAP experiments proved the for - mation of mobile bilayers . After bleaching a region of interest ( ROI ) the fluorescence recovered in the ROI . Diffusion coefficients of 2 . 5 ± 0 . 6 µm 2 / s were measured for TxR in the DOPC / DOPE / PIP 2 / TxR ( 64 . 9 : 30 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) and 1 . 7 ± 0 . 4 µm 2 / s in the DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( 44 . 9 : 30 : 20 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) bilayers on hydrophilic silicon diox - ide using a MATLAB Script by Jönsson et al . 78 The mobile fraction of TxR in the bi - layers without PS were determined to be 83 ± 3 % and the value for bilayers with PS resulted in a mobile fraction of 71 ± 5 % . Hence the AFM and FRAP experiments proved the formation and mobility of the bilayers . When the bilayer formation was successful the surface was imaged by AFM using con - tact mode ( cf . chapter 3 . 3 . 4 ) . This enabled to compare the surface topography before and after protein addition . Then ENTH ( 1 µM ) was added and the solution was mixed by stirring for 2 h . Subsequently again images of the surface were taken . The atomic force micrographs before and after ENTH incubation are shown in Figure 4 . 17 . 4 Results 64 Figure 4 . 17 : Atomic force micrographs of ( A ) DOPC / DOPE / PIP 2 / TxR ( 64 . 9 : 30 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) and ( C ) DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( 44 . 9 : 30 : 20 : 0 . 1 ) bilayers on hydrophilic silicon dioxide wafers prior ENTH addition . ( B ) and ( D ) show the corresponding micrographs after 2 h of ENTH incubation ( 1 µM ) . Only in the presence of PS , protein clusters were observed on the membrane surface . The micrographs show that before ENTH addition the DOPC / DOPE / PIP 2 / TxR ( Figure 4 . 17 A ) and DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( Figure 4 . 17 C ) bilayers had a homogenous surface with roughnesses of rms = 174 ± 17 pm ( n = 7 ) without PS and rms = 158 ± 14 pm ( n = 5 ) with PS . Addition of ENTH to the DOPC / DOPE / PIP 2 / TxR bilayers ( Figure 4 . 17 B ) led to a roughness of rms = 196 ± 22 pm ( n = 21 ) , but no structures were observed ( Figure 4 . 17 C ) . When PS was present in the bilayers incubation with ENTH for 2 h caused the appearance of small structures , which were about 0 . 5 µm larger or smaller . To inves - tigate if these structures could be assigned to protein adsorption the heights of these clusters were analyzed using a MatLab Script written by Dr . Ingo Mey ( Georg - August - 4 Results 65 University Göttingen ) . A threshold of the membrane height enabled to distinguish be - tween membrane and adsorbed molecules , so that the protein occupancy and height could be determined ( cf . chapter 3 . 3 . 4 ) . From the AFM images the protein occupancy of 6 ± 1 % and the protein height of 1 . 2 ±0 . 5 nm ( mean value ± SD , n = 32 , with n the number of evaluated images from three independent experiments ) were calculated ( Figure 4 . 18 ) . Figure 4 . 18 : Histogram plot of the protein heights averaged over 32 micrographs . A protein height of 1 . 2 ±0 . 5 nm was determined by fitting a normal distribution . The bin size ( 0 . 066 nm ) was calculated according to Freedman et al . 108 With these results it seemed likely that the small structures were caused by protein adsorption and were attributed to ENTH clusters . Due to the ENTH cluster formation the surface roughness increased up to rms = 263 ± 33 pm ( n = 32 ) . To ensure that the protein really bound to the membrane and not only to defects , oc - curring in the membrane , fluorescence images of these bilayers before and after ENTH incubation were taken . As control also the surface of membranes without ENTH incubation were imaged after 2h , showing a homogenous fluorescence over the whole substrates without visible defects in all cases ( Figure 4 . 19 ) . The few small bright spots were attributed to SUVs adhered to the surface . 4 Results 66 Figure 4 . 19 : Fluorescence images of ( A ) DOPC / DOPE / PIP 2 / TxR ( 64 . 9 : 30 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) and ( B ) DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( 44 . 9 : 30 : 20 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) bilayers . After 2h of incubation without ( A1 , B1 ) and with 1 µM ENTH ( A2 , B2 ) the bilayers were imaged again . In all cases a homogenous distribution of TxR was observed . AFM allows imaging in a nanometer range resolution 109 so even single protein ad - sorption should be possible to observe . The discrepancy of the protein coverage in RIfS ( cf . chapter 4 . 2 . 2 ) and AFM is not obvious . Hence FRAP measurements were per - formed to analyze the mobility of the bilayers after the ENTH incubation . The diffu - sion coefficients of DOPC / DOPE / PIP 2 / TxR ( 64 . 9 : 30 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) and DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( 44 . 9 : 30 : 20 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) bilayers after ENTH addition were determined . The bilayers were still mobile , but the mobility was decreased . In Table 4 . 6 the diffusion coefficients of TxR in the bilayers before and after ENTH addition are listed . 4 Results 67 Table 4 . 6 : Diffusion coefficients of TxR in DOPC / DOPE / PIP 2 / TxR ( 64 . 9 : 30 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) and DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( 44 . 9 : 30 : 20 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) bilayers before and after the incubation of 1 µM ENTH . lipid composition before ENTH addition after ENTH addition DOPC / DOPE / PIP 2 / TxR ( 64 . 9 : 30 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) 2 . 5 ± 0 . 6 µm 2 / s 0 . 6 ± 0 . 2 µm / s 2 DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( 44 . 9 : 30 : 20 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) 1 . 7 ± 0 . 4 µm 2 / s 0 . 3 ± 0 . 2 µm / s 2 The results show that the diffusion coefficient of TxR in the PS containing membranes after ENTH incubation was about the half of the diffusion coefficient of TxR in the DOPC / DOPE / PIP 2 bilayers when ENTH was present . Although the protein adsorption seemed to modulate the membrane mobility , imaging of single protein molecules was prevented due to a dynamic protein distribution in contrast to more immobile ENTH clusters ( when PS is present ) . 4 . 2 . 4 Investigation of the ENTH R114A mutant binding to PIP 2 The ENTH domain consists of 150 amino acids , which are essential for various intra - and intermolecular interactions . Mutation experiments were done by Ford et al . to investigate the role of the amphipathic helix in the membrane deformation process . 21 With co - sedimentations assays they presented that the binding affinity and mem - brane deformation activity change when the sixth amino acid in the helix was mu - tated . The binding affinity decreased with hydrophilicity of the amino acid residue . Furthermore , Yoon et al . used electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) and fluores - cence microscopy showing that clustering of the ENTH domain appears . 28 With the mutants K23E and E42K only binding , but no clustering of ENTH was observed , show - ing the importance of these amino acids for protein - protein interactions . Lai et al . pre - sented atomistic MD simulations , where they identified three important ENTH - membrane interaction regions : The binding pocket for PIP 2 , the α0 - helix and the R114 loop ( cf . Figure 1 . 3 ) . 110 4 Results 68 In order to specify the regions of the ENTH domain involved in certain interactions , experiments with the ENTH R114A mutant were performed . In this mutant the argi - nine in position 114 in the loop between the sixth and seventh helix is exchanged by an alanine . The mutant was expressed and purified by Dr . Ben Kroppen and Indrani Mukherjee from the group of Prof . Dr . Michael Meinecke ( Department of Cellular Bi - ochemistry , University Medical Center Göttingen ) . First of all , RIfS measurements were done to investigate the binding behavior of the mutant depending on the lipid composition . Therefore vesicles composed of POPC / PIP 2 ( 95 : 5 ) and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) were added to hydrophilic silicon dioxide substrates ( cf . chapter 3 . 3 . 1 ) , resulting in vesicle spreading and the formation of a bilayer . After rins - ing with PBS and passivation with BSA , the ENTH R114A mutant was added . The ENTH concentration was increased stepwise ( Figure 4 . 20 , indicated by arrows ) . A representative time - traces of the optical thickness ( Δ OT ) after ENTH R114A addition to POPC / PIP 2 and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 bilayers are plotted in Figure 4 . 20 . Figure 4 . 20 : Time - resolved change in optical thickness upon addition of different ENTH R114A con - centrations ( marked by arrows ) to ( A ) POPC / PIP 2 ( 95 : 5 ) and ( B ) POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) bilayers . The protein desorbs after rinsing with PBS showing the almost complete reversibility of the ENTH R114A binding . In both cases the optical thickness increased by ENTH R114A addition until it reached a plateau . With every further and higher concentrated protein addition the optical thickness was stepwise increased due to higher protein occupancy on the surface . Rinsing with PBS led to desorption , which indicated the reversible binding . When the 4 Results 69 bilayer was lacking POPS the Δ OT reached a value of 0 . 9 nm at an ENTH R114A con - centration of 5 . 0 µM ( Figure 4 . 20 A ) . In case of bilayers with 20 mol % PS the Δ OT in - creased up to 2 . 3 nm when 5 . 0 µM ENTH R114A was added ( Figure 4 . 20 B ) . This in - dicated a higher amount of bound mutant when PS is present . To obtain the maximum change in optical thickness and the binding affinity of the mutant to POPC / PIP 2 and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 bilayers , Δ OT ENTH R114A was plotted against the protein concentra - tion ( Figure 4 . 21 ) . Figure 4 . 21 : Adsorption isotherms of ENTH R114A to POPC / PIP 2 ( 95 : 5 ) ( blue circles ) and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) ( red circles ) bilayers . The values for ΔΔ OT max and K D ( Tab . 1 ) were ob - tained by fitting a Langmuir adsorption isotherm ( solid lines ) to the data . Non - linear regression weighted by the corresponding number of measurements that went into each concentration was car - ried out using a Levenberg - Marquardt algorithm . 103 , 104 Figure 4 . 21 shows the changes in optical thicknesses upon addition of different ENTH R114A concentrations to POPC / PIP 2 ( blue circles ) and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( red circles ) bilayers . Four individual measurements without POPS and four with POPS at protein concentrations of 0 . 3 to 5 . 0 µM were performed . By fitting the data with a Langmuir adsorption isotherm the maximum of the optical thickness change Δ OT ENTH R114A , max and the dissociation constant K D were obtained , showing the higher binding affinity of the ENTH R114 mutant to PS containing lipid bilayers . A non - linear regression was done using a Levenberg - Marquardt algorithm . 103 , 104 Thereby the regression was weighted by the amount of measurements for each concentration . For the POPC / PIP 2 4 Results 70 ( 95 : 5 ) system a K D of 2 . 9 ± 0 . 8 µM and a Δ OT ENTH R114A , max = 1 . 5 ± 0 . 2 nm were deter - mined . Bilayers composed of POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) exhibited a three times smaller K D value of 1 . 0 ±0 . 3 µM and Δ OT ENTH R114A , max of 2 . 7 ± 0 . 2 nm , which is twice as high as for the system lacking POPS . The Δ OT ENTH R114A , max values for the mutant are similar to those of the ENTH wildtype ( wt ) , but the binding affinity of the mutant to both lipid systems decreased compared to that of ENTH wt . All values for the ENTH wt and the mutant are summarized in Table 4 . 7 . Table 4 . 7 : Summary of the fit results of the Langmuir adsorption isotherms for ENTH wt and ENTH R114A . The K D and the Δ OT ENTH , max are given as parameter ± SE . lipid composition K D / µM Δ OT ENTH , max / nm ENTH wt ENTH R114A ENTH wt ENTH R114A POPC / PIP 2 ( 95 : 5 ) 1 . 0 ± 0 . 2 2 . 9 ± 0 . 8 1 . 6 ± 0 . 1 1 . 5 ± 0 . 2 POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) 0 . 42 ± 0 . 05 1 . 0 ± 0 . 3 2 . 5 ± 0 . 1 2 . 7 ± 0 . 2 Table 4 . 7 shows that the mutant was still binding to the PIP 2 - containing membranes , but its binding affinity to PIP 2 doped membranes changed . The mutant also bound reversible to those membranes . For the POPC / PIP 2 ( 95 : 5 ) bilayers a reversibility of 84 ± 9 % was determined . Moreover 89 ± 3 % of the ENTH R114 mutant bound revers - ibly to POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) bilayers . Furthermore ENTH wt formed clusters on bilayers composed of DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR , which was shown by AFM experiments ( cf . Figure 4 . 17 ) . To compare if also ENTH R114A mutant clusters on PS containing supported bilayers appear , atomic force micrographs of the surface before and after protein ad - dition were taken . In Figure 4 . 22 the micrographs of DOPC / DOPE / PIP 2 / TxR ( 64 . 9 : 30 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) and DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( 44 . 9 : 30 : 20 : 0 . 1 ) bilayers before ( A , C ) and after ( B , D ) ENTH addition are illustrated . 4 Results 71 Figure 4 . 22 : Atomic force micrographs of ( A ) DOPC / DOPE / PIP 2 / TxR ( 64 . 9 / 30 / 5 / 0 . 1 ) and ( C ) DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( 44 . 9 / 30 / 20 / 0 . 1 ) bilayers on hydrophilic silicon dioxide wafers prior protein addition . The corresponding micrographs ( B , D ) were obtained after 2 h of ENTH R114A incu - bation ( 1 µM ) . Even in the presence of DOPS , no protein clusters were observed on the membrane surface indicating the necessity of the amino acid R114 for ENTH cluster formation . The surfaces of the DOPC / DOPE / PIP 2 / TxR ( Figure 4 . 22 A ) and DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( Figure 4 . 22 C ) bilayers showed a homogenous distri - bution of the membrane . For the bilayers without PS a surface roughness of rms = 142 ± 13 pm ( n = 3 ) was determined . When PS - containing bilayers were im - aged surface roughness of rms = 142 ± 12 pm ( n = 4 ) was obtained . The micrographs also showed that in both cases no specific structures were observed on the surface after the protein addition ( Figure 4 . 22 B and D ) in contrast to the ENTH wt ( cf . Figure 4 . 17 ) . The roughness of the surfaces after ENTH incubation were calculated to be slightly higher with rms = 152 ± 7 pm ( n = 3 ) lacking PS and rms = 197 ± 41 pm ( n = 11 ) in presence of PS . This showed that the surface nature changed due to ENTH 4 Results 72 binding , although no ENTH R114A clusters were observed , indicating that the amino acid R114A is important for clustering of ENTH . 4 . 3 Investigation of the ENTH - PIP 2 interactions on lipid monolay - ers The concentration of the receptor lipid PIP 2 and the presence of PS have an influence on the amount of bound ENTH ( cf . sections 4 . 1 . 3 and 4 . 2 . 2 ) . Moreover , it was shown that substrate interactions with the membrane lead to asymmetric artificial lipid bi - layers on hydrophilic silicon dioxide surfaces . This was shown by binding studies on supported lipid monolayers ( cf . chapter 4 . 1 . 3 ) , indicating a higher protein occupancy compared to supported bilayers . Another possibility to investigate the interactions of ENTH with monolayers is the Langmuir - Blodgett trough with the advantage that interactions with substrate sur - faces are prevented . This method allowed to investigate the surface activity of ENTH as a function of the lipid composition . By measuring surface pressure changes upon ENTH addition , the penetration ability of the ENTH helix could be determined . The influence of the lipids PIP 2 and PS on the ENTH penetration ability was investigated . First of all , surface pressure - area isotherms of all lipid compositions were recorded to analyze how the lipid composition influences the monolayer . Moreover , it was im - portant to analyze the monolayer stability of the desired lipid mixtures . Only if the monolayers were stable enough over the experimental time , meaning lipids did not submerge into the subphase , it was guaranteed that enough PIP 2 molecules were available for ENTH binding . Finally , penetration experiments with different lipid mix - tures were performed . 4 . 3 . 1 PIP 2 influence on the ENTH penetration ability Binding of ENTH to bi - and monolayers is dependent on the concentration of the re - ceptor lipid PIP 2 ( cf . chapter 4 . 1 . 3 ) . Due to this the intermolecular interactions of the 4 Results 73 lipids within these membrane models are of great interest . Depending on the head groups , the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid chains and their conformation , the isotherms can differ . 111 , 112 These isotherms help to understand the lateral inter - molecular interactions in the monolayer and the influence on protein - membrane in - teractions . The Langmuir - Blodgett trough technique was used to record pressure - area isotherms of POPC / POPE monolayers with different PIP 2 content . To mimic the natural plasma membrane most closely POPC and POPE were used as these are pre - sent in membranes in a high amount . 56 Furthermore , PIP 2 was added as receptor lipid for the ENTH domain . Isotherms of POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) and POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 80 - x : 20 : x , with x = 1 , 5 , 10 mol % ) were measured in ultrapure water . As the following penetration experiments with protein were performed in HEPES buffer , also iso - therms were recorded in HEPES buffer . The corresponding averaged surface pressure ( π ) versus area per molecule ( A M ) diagrams are plotted in Figure 4 . 23 . Figure 4 . 23 : Averaged surface pressure - area per molecule isotherms of POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 , black ) , POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 79 : 20 : 1 , light blue ) , POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 , blue ) and POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 70 : 20 : 10 , purple ) at 20 °C . The subphases were ultrapure water ( A ) and HEPES buffer ( B ) . The error bars represents the standard deviations of the area per molecule values at the same surface pressure with a surface pressure deviation of 0 . 05 mN / m . The isotherms were recorded from π = 0 to 32 mN / m showing an increase of the lipid packing with increased PIP2 concentration . Figure 4 . 23 shows averaged isotherms of POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) and POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 80 - x : 20 : x , with x = 1 , 5 , 10 mol % ) measured in water ( Figure 4 . 23 A ) and HEPES buffer ( Figure 4 . 23 B ) . In all cases , the surface pressure increased with reduced area 4 Results 74 per molecule A M . None of the isotherms showed a coexistence region ( cf . Sec - tion 3 . 3 . 5 ) . The isotherms were shifted to lower A M values when the PIP 2 concentra - tion increased from 1 mol % PIP 2 to 10 mol % PIP 2 . Thus , increasing the PIP 2 content led to a higher packing density or to the loss of lipids to the subphase . Within the errors , no significant differences of the isotherms in buffer or water were observed . The isotherms of the lipid composition POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) were similar to those of POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) . Some monolayers with 1 mol % PIP 2 on HEPES buffer collapsed at high surface pressures ( about 27 - 30 mN / m ) , indicated by the drop of π . In the averaged isotherm of this lipid composition it is represented by a sudden shift to smaller A M above 25 mN / m ( cf . Figure 4 . 23 , light blue , Figure 4 . 23 B ) . Thus , the maximum of the lipid packing was reached . To compare the isotherms , the A 20 - values were listed in Table 4 . 8 . The A 20 value describes the surface pressure at an area per molecule of A M = 20 Å 2 and allows to compare the lipid packing of different lipids at a certain surface pressure . At this certain surface pressure a collapse of all monolayer is excluded . The area per molecule values ( A M ) were averaged over all lipids in the ratio of their molecular fraction . Table 4 . 8 : A 20 mean values with standard deviations obtained from the isotherms with the different lipid compositions . The subphases were ultrapure water and HEPES buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , 160 mM KCl , pH 4 . 7 ) . n describes the amount of recorded isotherms .

With an increasing PIP 2 concentration , the area per molecule slightly de - creased indicating a denser lipid packing of the monolayers . Within the errors the 4 Results 75 POPC / POPE lipid mixture showed similar area per molecules values compared to the lipid compositions with 1 mol % and 5 mol % . In order to investigate if the monolayers composed of POPC / POPE and POPC / POPE / PIP 2 were stable over time , the change in surface pressure after reach - ing a value above 30 mN / m was recorded . In cell membranes , the lipid packing den - sity has an area per molecule of 40 - 70 Å 2 , which is equivalent to a monolayer at this surface pressure . 113 , 114 At the beginning , the monolayers were compressed to the de - sired surface pressure , then the barrier motor was stopped to keep the trough area constant and the surface pressure decay was observed . The monolayer with 1 mol % did not collapse during these experiments . Figure 4 . 24 shows an exemplary plot of the surface pressure over 1 h for a POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) monolayer . Figure 4 . 24 : Exemplary plot of the surface pressure vs . time of a POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) mono - layer . After reaching the desired surface pressure ( above 30 mN / m ) the barriers were stopped at t = 0 s , keeping the trough area constant . The change in surface pressure was detected over one hour to determine the change in surface pressure and to obtain information about the monolayer stability . The measurement was performed at 20°C with HEPES buffer as subphase . After the trough area was held constant , the surface pressure decreased fast about 0 . 7 mN / m , which was attributed to the barrier motor stop . Even though this behavior was observed often , the surface pressure stabilized after a time and the change in surface pressure got small . The total surface pressure loss was 2 ± 3 % for 4 Results 76 1 mol % PIP 2 ( n = 2 ) , 4 ± 1 % for 5 mol % PIP 2 ( n = 2 ) and 2 ± 1 % for 10 mol % PIP 2 ( n = 3 ) over 1 h . The POPC / POPE monolayers without PIP 2 showed a surface pressure loss of 1 ± 3 % . If the surface pressure decreased less than 1 mN / m per minute the mono - layer was defined as stable . 115 Although it could not be excluded that PIP 2 or other lipids submerged into the subphase during the compression , once 30 mN / m was reached , the monolayers with the different lipid compositions were sufficiently stable to perform insertion experiments . As monolayer stability was guaranteed , penetration experiments of ENTH into POPC / POPE and POPC / POPE / PIP 2 monolayers were done at different initial surface pressures ( π 0 ) with a protein concentration of 1 µM . Δ π is dependent on the protein concentration and reaches a saturation at c ENTH = 0 . 2 µM . 25 Therefore , at higher con - centrations the maximal change in the surface pressure ( Δ π ) should not be influenced by the protein concentration and consequently represents the maximum value for Δ π . The isotherms were performed on a Teflon trough , comprising a volume of 120 mL . To reduce the amount of necessary protein to yield a concentration of 1 µM , the mon - olayer penetration experiments were performed with a custom - built protein trough ( V = 2 mL , cf . Section 3 . 3 . 5 ) . After the desired surface pressure was reached , the small Teflon barriers were inserted into the protein trough . If the surface pressure re - mained stable , ENTH was added to the subphase via a syringe . To distribute the pro - tein the system was then mixed with the syringe . Addition of the protein resulted in an increase of the surface pressure . Figure 4 . 25 represents an exemplary time - re - solved increase of π after injection of 1 µM ENTH to a POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 70 : 20 : 10 ) monolayer at an initial surface pressure of 14 . 6 mN / m . 4 Results 77 Figure 4 . 25 : Exemplary plot of the surface pressure vs . time of a POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 70 : 20 : 10 ) mono - layer after ENTH addition at 20 °C using a protein trough . When the desired surface pressure was reached ( 14 . 6 mN / m ) the small Teflon barriers were implemented in the protein trough , resulting in a drop in surface pressure . When no change in surface pressure was observed , the ENTH domain was added via a small hole in the trough . Due to protein - monolayer interactions and penetration ability of the ENTH domain , the surface pressure increased reaching a maximum after 6000 s . After the insert of the small protein trough barriers , a sudden decrease of π of about 1 mN / m was observed . Once π stabilized ( usually within a few minutes ) , 1 µM ENTH was injected into the subphase . Dependent on the initial surface pressure ( π 0 ) , π reached a maximum after 10 - 210 min . In general the time to reach the maximum in - creased with decreased initial surface pressure as the surface pressure change Δ π was higher at those conditions due to a looser lipid packing of the monolayer . The increase of π usually did not increased exponential , exhibiting local extrema . Directly after insertion of ENTH the π increased fast until it almost reached a plateau ( Figure 4 . 25 ) or even decreased . Then π increased fast again . This behavior was observed several times and was attributed to the uneven distribution of the protein as the sys - tem was just mixed with a syringe directly after protein addition . Afterwards the ENTH was only distributed by diffusion . To calculate the exclusion or critical surface pressure ( π c ) at which no further protein insertion was possible into POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) and POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 80 - x : 20 : x , 4 Results 78 with x = 1 ; 5 and 10 mol % ) monolayers , Δ π was plotted against π 0 ( Figure 4 . 26 ) . In - terpolation yielded the intersection with the x - axis , the critical surface pressure . Figure 4 . 26 : Monolayer penetration of the ENTH domain into POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) and POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 80 - x : 20 : x , with x = 1 , 5 , 10 ) monolayers . Maximum increase in surface pressure ( Δ π ) was monitored as a function of π 0 values . The subphase was 10 mM HEPES , 160 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 . Figure 4 . 26 shows the Δ π at initial surface pressures of π 0 = 14 - 30 mN / m for four dif - ferent lipid mixtures . First of all , monolayers lacking PIP 2 were used to check the sur - face activity or the penetration ability of ENTH independently of the receptor binding . Towards this lipid mixture , the ENTH domain had a low intrinsic penetration capabil - ity with a π c = 23 . 2 ±0 . 8 mN / m . When the concentration of PIP 2 was increased to 1 mol % , the π c just slightly increased to 24 . 1 ± 0 . 5 mN / m . At higher PIP 2 content , the penetration ability of ENTH into the monolayers increased ( π c = 30 . 3 ± 0 . 4 mN / m for 5 mol % and π c = 28 . 7 ±0 . 6 mN / m for 10 mol % ) . The errors were given as weighted standard deviations of the fits . In Figure 4 . 27 the area per molecule at 20 mN / m ( A ) and the critical surface pressure after ENTH addition ( B ) were plotted against the PIP 2 concentration , showing the in - fluence of the receptor lipid concentration as well as the lipid packing on the ENTH penetration ability . To ensure that the monolayer did not collapse at high pressures , the area per molecule at 20 mN / m was chosen to compare the lipid packing density . Considering the π c value of the monolayers with 5 mol % ( 30 . 3 ± 0 . 4mN / m ) to 10 mol % PIP 2 ( 28 . 7 ± 0 . 6 mN / m ) no significant differences were observed indicating 4 Results 79 that a maximum of the ENTH penetration was reached . Monolayers with 10 mol % PIP 2 showed a denser lipid packing compared to the monolayer with 5 mol % PIP 2 . Figure 4 . 27 : ( A ) Lipid packing against PIP 2 concentration and ( B ) the critical surface pressure against the PIP 2 content . The area per molecule at the beginning increases by addition of PIP 2 and then de - creases with increased PIP 2 concentration . The critical surface pressure also first rises by the addition of PIP 2 , reaches a maximum at 5 mol % and then decreases again indicating that at some point the lipid packing prevents further protein penetration . In general , the Δ π values for lipid mixtures with 5 mol % PIP 2 were about 1 mN / m higher as the data measured on 10 mol % PIP 2 monolayers . Even though the scattering of the data points is quite high , this indicated a maximum of the penetration capability of ENTH into monolayers with 5 mol % PIP 2 . 4 . 3 . 2 PS influence on the ENTH penetration ability The influence of PS on the ENTH - PIP 2 interaction was already described earlier . 8 , 26 Also RIfS measurements showed a higher binding affinity of ENTH to PIP 2 containing supported bilayers in the presence of PS ( cf . Section 4 . 2 . 2 ) . To investigate the influ - ence of PS on the penetration capability of ENTH to PIP 2 - containing monolayers , first of all the intermolecular interactions within POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) , POPC / POPE / POPS ( 60 : 20 : 20 ) and POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 ( 55 : 20 : 20 : 5 ) monolayers were analyzed 4 Results 80 with surface pressure - area isotherms on ultrapure water and HEPES as subphases . Averaged isotherms of these lipid compositions are shown in Figure 4 . 28 . Figure 4 . 28 : Averaged surface pressure - area per molecule isotherms of POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 , black , n = 4 ) , POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 , blue , n = 3 ) , POPC / POPE / POPS ( 60 : 20 : 20 , orange , n = 3 ) and POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 ( 55 : 20 : 20 : 5 , red , n = 3 ) at 20 °C . The subphases were ultrapure water ( A ) and HEPES buffer ( B ) . The error bars represent the standard deviations of the area per molecule at the same surface pressure with a surface pressure deviation of 0 . 05 mN / m . The isotherms were recorded from π = 0 to 31 mN / m , showing the influence of the PS on the lipid packing of the monolayers as the isotherms are shifted to higher molecule per area values . No significant difference between the iso - therms on water or HEPES buffer were observed . Independent of the lipid mixture the curve shape of all isotherms resemble one an - other . When decreasing the trough area , the surface pressure steadily increased and no co - existence region was observed ( cf . Section 3 . 3 . 5 ) . It was possible to compress the POPC / POPE and POPC / POPE / PIP 2 monolayers further than the monolayers con - taining PS . The isotherm of the POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 monolayer showed the high - est area per molecule values of the lipids for the same surface pressure compared to the other mixtures , indicating that POPS decreased the lipid packing of the monolay - ers . Especially in combination with PIP 2 the lipid packing in the monolayers was de - creased . Within the error margins the isotherms on HEPES buffer did not differ from the isotherms on water . Furthermore the lipid mixtures were stable up to the π values of 31 mN / m , allowing the measurement of the ENTH penetration capability . As al - 4 Results 81 ready mentioned in chapter 4 . 3 . 1 , the A 20 values were determined to obtain infor - mation about the lipid packing ( Table 4 . 9 ) and to compare them . The area per mole - cule values ( A M ) were averaged over all lipids in the ratio of their molecular fraction . Table 4 . 9 : A 20 mean values with standard deviations obtained from the isotherms with the different lipid compositions . The subphases were ultrapure water and HEPES buffer . n is the number of rec - orded isotherms .

Comparing POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) and POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) monolayers the li - pid packing got looser when PS was added , indicated by the increase of the A 20 value . Monolayers containing PS and PIP 2 even showed higher A 20 values and consequently had a lower packing density . Although , no collapse of the monolayers was observed until 31 mN / m , it was neces - sary to investigate the monolayer stability over time to ensure the accessibility of the receptor lipid during the experiment ( cf . Section 3 . 3 . 5 ) . Therefore , the surface pres - sure change ( Δ π ) was recorded over time to obtain the percentage loss in surface pressure after 1 h for POPC / POPE / POPS ( 60 : 20 : 20 ) and POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 ( 55 : 20 : 20 : 5 ) monolayers . Over 1 h the surface pressure increased about 1 ± 1 % for the monolayers without PIP 2 and decreased about 6 ± 2 % when PIP 2 was present , in - dicating sufficient monolayer stability . 115 4 Results 82 With these stable monolayers penetration experiments of ENTH were possible . The experimental conditions were similar to the experiments shown in chapter 4 . 3 . 1 . Af - ter the adjusted surface pressure was reached , the small barriers were implemented . When almost no change in π was observed , indicating stable conditions , 1 µM ENTH was added into the subphase and then mixed with the syringe . To investigate how the lipid PS influences the penetration ability of ENTH , the increases of Δ π for POPC / POPE / POPS ( 60 : 20 : 20 ) and POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 ( 55 : 20 : 20 : 5 ) monolayers dependent on the initial surface pressure ( π 0 ) were analyzed . At low π 0 the change in surface pressure was greater compared to higher π 0 values due to the lower packing of the monolayer . When PS and PIP 2 were present the maximum of π was reached after 60 - 270 min , whereby the time usually increased with decreasing π 0 . Some irreg - ularities in the surface pressure increase were attributed to inhomogeneous ENTH distribution ( cf . chapter 4 . 3 . 1 ) To obtain the penetration capability of ENTH into POPC / POPE / POPS ( 60 : 20 : 20 ) and POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 ( 55 : 20 : 20 : 5 ) monolayers , the data was plotted in a Δ π – π 0 diagram . Furthermore the data for the POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( cf . section 4 . 3 . 1 ) lipid mix - ture was added . Consequently , this allowed the comparision of all lipid mixtures and the influence of PS on the penetration ability . By interpolating π c was determined ( Figure 4 . 29 ) . 4 Results 83 Figure 4 . 29 : Monolayer penetration of the ENTH domain into POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 , ) , POPC / POPE / POPS ( 60 : 20 : 20 ) , POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) and POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 ( 55 : 20 : 20 : 5 ) monolayers . Maximum increase in surface pressure ( Δ π ) was monitored as a function of π 0 values . The subphase was 10 mM HEPES , 160 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 . The x - intercepts in Figure 4 . 29 of the fits reveal a mean Δ π c of 30 . 3 ± 0 . 4 mN / m for POPC / POPE / PIP 2 monolayers . Penetration experiments of ENTH into POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 monolayers yielded a π c of 32 . 0 ±0 . 9 mN / m . The fit with PS shows a slighter decrease of Δ π with increasing π 0 . Within the scatter of the measure - ments the values are similar . The experiments without PIP 2 showed that the ENTH penetration ability decreased down to 23 . 2 ± 0 . 8 mN / m for POPC / POPE monolayers and 25 . 0 ±1 . 0 mN / m for the POPC / POPE / POPS monolayers . The errors were given as weighted standard deviations of the fits . This reveals that the penetration capability of the ENTH domain is clearly decreased when PIP 2 is lacking even though PS is pre - sent . Furthermore , the penetration ability of ENTH into monolayers composed of POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 only slightly increased compared to POPC / POPE / PIP 2 mon - olayers , indicating that PS has almost no impact on the penetration capability of ENTH . 4 Results 84 4 . 4 Adhered GUVs as a membrane model to investigate protein - membrane interactions The surface activity and especially the insertion of the amphipathic helix of ENTH re - sulted in an increase of the surface pressure in monolayer penetration experiments ( cf . chapters 4 . 3 . 1 and 4 . 3 . 2 ) . It was shown that the lipid composition has an influence on the exclusion pressure , although the effect of PS was only slight . Another possibil - ity to investigate the activity of ENTH is the analysis of the activity as a function of membrane tension in bilayers . 36 In this work , GUVs were adhered to a biotin - PEG functionalized glass surface to im - mobilize them . By using fluorescence microscopy the vesicle geometry was deter - mined , which could be evaluated to get the membrane tension . Afterwards , ENTH was added to see how the protein effects the membrane tension . Based on this the influ - ence of the lipid head group Phosphatidylserine ( PS ) on the binding behavior of ENTH as a function of lateral membrane tension was investigated . 4 . 4 . 1 Theoretical model Adhesion of vesicles or cells were already used to investigate membrane - protein in - teractions . 116 In this thesis , the membrane tension of adhered GUVs , generated as de - scribed in chapter 3 . 2 . 2 , was analyzed to determine the impact of ENTH on the lateral membrane tension as a function of the lipid composition . Attractive forces between the GUV and the surface result in the adhesion of the GUV . During this process the volume of the GUV remains constant under iso - osmolar con - ditions due to low water permeability of membranes . In contrast to this , the vesicle shape changes from a sphere with a radius r v to a spherical cap with a radius r ad . Ad - ditionally , an adhesion area or contact area with a radius r i is observed ( Figure 4 . 30 ) . From the geometry of the adhered vesicles it is then possible to calculate the mem - brane tension . 4 Results 85 Figure 4 . 30 : Schematic illustration of a GUV before ( A ) and after ( B ) adhesion to a surface . The GUV geometry changes from a sphere with a radius r v to a spherical cap with a radius r ad and a contact area ( radius r i ) . h describes the height of the spherical cap in ( B ) , which is missing to get a complete sphere . Marsh theoretically described the observable tension of a fluctuating membrane us - ing equation ( 4 . 5 ) : 117 𝜎 = Δ𝜎 − 𝐾 A 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 2𝐴 v 𝜅 ∑ ( 𝜎 𝜎𝑞 2 + 𝜅𝑞 4 ) 𝑞 ( 4 . 5 ) K A is the area compressibility modulus , k B the Boltzmann constant , T the absolute temperature , κ the bending rigidity and A v the area of a free vesicle . Δ σ depicts the increase in membrane tension of a tension free planar membrane and is proportional to the fractional area expansion ( Δ A / A v ) and K A ( equation ( 4 . 5 ) ) . Δ𝜎 = 𝐾 A Δ𝐴 𝐴 v ( 4 . 6 ) Integration with q min = π / √𝐴 M and q max = π / √𝐴 v , where A M is the area per lipid , the observable tension σ of a fluctuating membrane is then calculated with equation ( 4 . 7 ) . 𝜎 = Δ𝜎 − 𝐾 A 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 8𝜋𝜅 ln ( 𝜎𝐴 v 𝜋 2 𝜅 + 1 𝜎𝐴 M 𝜋 2 𝜅 + 1 ) ( 4 . 7 ) The denominator of the logarithm becomes close to unity when the membrane ten - sion is low ( σ ≪ π 2 κ / A M ≈ 2 ∙ 10 3 mN / m ) , simplifying equation ( 4 . 7 ) : 4 Results 86 𝜎 = Δ𝜎 − 𝐾 A 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 8𝜋𝜅 ln ( 𝜎𝐴 v 𝜋 2 𝜅 + 1 ) ( 4 . 8 ) Under the assumption of K A ≫ σ ≫ π 2 κ / A v ≈ 10 - 6 mN / m , which is valid for relevant membrane tensions , the membrane tension is described with equation ( 4 . 9 ) as ( σ A v ) / ( π 2 κ ) is ≫ 1 . 𝜎 = Δ𝜎 − 𝐾 A 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 8𝜋𝜅 ln ( 𝜎𝐴 v 𝜋 2 𝜅 ) ( 4 . 9 ) When equation ( 4 . 6 ) and ( 4 . 9 ) are combined , the membrane tension of an adhered vesicle can be calculated using equation ( 4 . 10 ) 𝜎 = 𝐾 A Δ𝐴 𝐴 v − 𝐾 A 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 8𝜋𝜅 ln ( 𝜎𝐴 v 𝜋 2 𝜅 ) ( 4 . 10 ) The membrane tension of the adhered GUV minus the tension of the free vesicle ( σ 0 ) enables to compare the obtained membrane tension with different reference states from previous studies . 118 , 119 Thereby , the flattening of fluctuations and the dilation of the area per molecule has to be considered . Δ𝐴 𝐴 v = 𝜎 − 𝜎 0 𝐾 A − 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 8𝜋𝜅 ln ( 𝜎 𝜎 0 ) ( 4 . 11 ) The fractional area expansion term can be calculated from the geometries of the GUVs before and after adhesion ( Figure 4 . 30 ) . The fractional area expansion is calculated with equation ( 4 . 12 ) . Δ𝐴 𝐴 v = A ad − 𝐴 𝑣 𝐴 v = 4𝜋𝑟 ad2 − 2𝜋𝑟 ad ℎ + 𝜋𝑟 i2 − 4𝜋𝑟 v2 4𝜋𝑟 v2 ( 4 . 12 ) h is the height of the spherical cap ( Figure 4 . 30 ) . Considering a constant volume of the vesicle during the adhesion process ( V v = V ad ) results in equation ( 4 . 15 ) . 𝑉 𝑉 = 4 3 𝜋𝑟 v3 ( 4 . 13 ) 4 Results 87 𝑉 ad = 4 3 𝜋𝑟 ad3 − 𝜋ℎ 6 ( 3𝑟 i2 + ℎ 2 ) ( 4 . 14 ) 4 3 𝜋𝑟 v3 = 4 3 𝜋𝑟 ad3 − 𝜋ℎ 6 ( 3𝑟 i2 + ℎ 2 ) ( 4 . 15 ) Determination of the radius of the immobile , free vesicles r v and the height of the spherical cap h is experimentally complicated to realize and can be described as a function of r i and r ad : ℎ = 𝑟 ad − √𝑟 ad 2 − 𝑟 i 2 ( 4 . 16 ) 𝑟 v = √𝑟 ad 3 − 𝑟 ad − √𝑟 𝑎𝑑 2 − 𝑟 𝑖 2 8 ( 3𝑟 i2 + ( 𝑟 ad − √𝑟 ad 2 − 𝑟 i 2 ) 2 ) 3 ( 4 . 17 ) Normalization of the radii to r ad gives dimensionless variables and substitution of them in equation ( 4 . 12 ) results in : 79 Δ𝐴 𝐴 v = 4𝜋 − 2𝜋 ( 1 − √1 − ( 𝑟 i r ad ) 2 + 𝜋 ( 𝑟 i 𝑟 ad ) 2 4𝜋 ( √1 − 2 − ( 𝑟 i 𝑟 ad ) 2 √1 − ( 𝑟 i 𝑟 ad ) 2 − 2√1 − ( 𝑟 i 𝑟 ad ) 2 4 3 ) 2 − 1 ( 4 . 18 ) Finally , the lateral membrane tension of the adhered GUV can be calculated numeri - cally by the combination of equation ( 4 . 11 ) and ( 4 . 18 ) . 4 Results 88 𝜎 − 𝜎 0 𝐾 A + 𝑘 𝐵 𝑇 8𝜋𝜅 ln ( 𝜎 𝜎 0 ) = 4𝜋 − 2𝜋 ( 1 − 𝑏 ) + 𝜋 ( 𝑟 i 𝑟 ad ) 2 4𝜋 ( √1 − 2 − ( 𝑟 i 𝑟 ad ) 2 𝑏 − 2𝑏 4 3 ) 2 − 1 ( 4 . 19 ) with 𝑏 = √1 − ( 𝑟 i 𝑟 ad ) 2 . Rawicz et al . measured the area compressibility modulus and the bending rigidity for a DOPC membrane via micropipette aspiration and yielded a K A of 265 ± 18 mN / m and a κ of 21 k B T ( ( 0 . 85 ± 0 . 1 ) ∙10 - 19 J ) . 120 For GUVs weakly adhered to a solid support , pre - tensions ( σ 0 ) were measured to be in a range of 10 - 1 - 10 - 3 mN / m . 121 Using the different pre - tension regimes , the lateral tension as a function of r i / r ad first increases slow and then fast when the dilation exceeds the excess area , which is stored in mem - brane undulations . 36 , 119 Calculation of the membrane tension of the adhered GUVs before and after ENTH ad - dition hence can yield the protein activity as a function of membrane tension depend - ent of the lipid composition . 4 . 4 . 2 Adhesion of biotinylated GUVs on PEGylated surfaces Adhered GUVs were already used to study membrane - protein interaction or phase separation of lipid bilayers . 122 – 124 Gleisner et al . used Avidin coated glass surfaces to immobilize biotinylated GUVs and therewith analyzed the ENTH - PIP 2 interactions as a function of membrane tension . 36 They performed these experiments with adhered GUVs composed of DOPC / DOPE / cap - biotin - DOPE / Atto488 - DPPE ( 67 : 30 : 2 : 1 ) . The membrane tension of these GUVs were regulated by the magnesium chloride ( MgCl 2 ) concentration in the buffer . In this work , a similar system was used to investigate how the lipid head group PS influences the ENTH binding considering the membrane tension of the GUVs before and after ENTH addition . As PS and PIP 2 exhibit negative charges and are known to 4 Results 89 cluster in the presents of divalent ions , 125 , 126 the buffer and the functionalization of the surface were changed . MgCl 2 was removed from the buffer and NeutrAvidin was used instead of avidin to immobilize the vesicles . 36 NeutrAvidin is known to reduce the unspecific interactions compared to avidin . 127 Direct functionalization of the surface with NeutrAvidin by simple incubation on a hydrophilized glass substrate led to an inhomogenous occupancy of the protein on the glass slides ( Figure 4 . 31 A ) , which can be explained by less unspecific interactions of NeutrAvidin with the hydrophilic glass surface . As a homogenous coverage with the protein was necessary to obtain adhesion of biotinylated GUVs , the glass slide sur - faces were silanized and PEGylated ( PEG = Poly ( ethylene glycol ) ) ( cf . 3 . 2 . 2 ) . Using bi - otin - linked PEG ( b - PEG ) ensured an affinity of NeutrAvidin to the surface and due to four biotin binding sides , additionally binding to the biotinylated vesicles was guar - anteed . To ensure the accessibility of the biotin groups on the surface , methoxy func - tionalized PEGs ( m - PEG ) were added ( ratio m - PEG / b - PEG 1 : 2 ) . Similar PEG - functionalizations were already used in previous studies . 128 , 129 With the new func - tionalization method incubation with DyLight ® 594 labeled Neutravidin resulted in a homogenous NeutrAvidin coverage ( Figure 4 . 31 B ) . Figure 4 . 31 : Fluorescence images of ( A ) hydrophilized and ( B ) biotin - PEG - functionalized glass slides after incubation with DyLight ® 594 labeled Neutravidin and subsequent rinsing with buffer . Without PEG - functionalization the protein was removed from the surface by rinsing with buffer resulting in an inhomogeneous coverage of NeutrAvidin . Due to the strong biotin - NeutrAvidin interaction the biotin an even distribution of the labeled protein on the PEG - functionalized surface was observed . 4 Results 90 Figure 4 . 31 clearly shows the specific NeutrAvidin - biotin interaction . In Figure 4 . 31 A the hydrophilized glass slides were just directly incubated with the protein . After rins - ing with buffer NeutrAvidin was partly removed . When the glass slides were first si - lanized with ( 3 - Glycidyloxypropyl ) trimethoxysilane ( GOPTS ) and then PEGylated with a mixture of m - PEG and b - PEG ( cf . chapter 3 . 2 . 2 ) , the NeutrAvidin strongly bound to the surface , which was not removed by rinsing with buffer . After the suc - cessful coverage of the surface with NeutrAvidin biotinylated GUVs could be added to the substrates . GUVs composed of DOPC / DOPS / Cholesterol / cap - biotin - DOPE / PIP 2 / Atto488 - DPPE ( 76 : 10 : 10 : 2 : 1 : 1 ) turned out to be large and stable enough to perform these experiments . Higher concentrations of DOPS or DOPE in combina - tion with the b - PEG - NeutrAvidin surface resulted in instable GUVs , preventing the analysis of adhesion areas and consequently the membrane tension . Incubation of these GUVs on the PEG - surface for 15 min obtained immobilized GUVs with small adhesion areas ( Figure 4 . 32 ) . Fluorescence images of the adhered GUVs were taken by means of Spinning Disc confocal laser microscopy ( SDCLM ) . To obtain the radii of the adhered GUV and the contact area ( cf . 3 . 2 . 2 ) , z - stacks of the GUVs with 150 - 250 nm between the slides were recorded . Figure 4 . 32 : z - stacks of an adhered GUVs obtained by SDCLM . ( A ) Cross section of the adhered GUV with the radius r ad . ( B ) Fluorescence image of the contact area plane to determine r i . Lipid composition : DOPC / DOPS / Cholesterol / cap - biotin - DOPE / PIP 2 / Atto488 - DPPE ( 76 : 10 : 10 : 2 : 1 : 1 ) . Calculation of the lateral tension from the geometry of the vesicles is only possible if the ratio r i / r ad is constant over the experimental time . The radii were determined as 4 Results 91 described in chapter 3 . 2 . 2 . Also after 2 h the adhered vesicles showed sufficient sta - bility as the ratio r i / r ad did not change within the errors ( Figure 4 . 33 ) . Figure 4 . 33 : Ratios of the contact area radius to the adhered vesicle radius ( r i / r ad ) as a function of time for GUVs ( DOPC / DOPS / Cholesterol / cap - biotin - DOPE / PIP 2 / Atto488 - DPPE ( 76 : 10 : 10 : 2 : 1 : 1 ) ) adhered to a NeutrAvidin covered surface , indicating the sufficient stability of the GUVs after 2 h . Statistical Mann - Whitney U test : ns - not significant ( p = 0 . 3 ) . 25 GUVs were analyzed after subsidence ( 15 min ) and 16 GUVs after 2 h , yielding r i / r ad values of 0 . 16 ± 0 . 04 and 0 . 17 ± 0 . 04 , respectively . The lateral membrane ten - sion of the adhered GUVs was then calculated from the ratio of r i / r ad using equation ( 4 . 19 ) with an area compressibility modulus of K A = 265 mN / m , a bending rigidity of  = 21 k B T and a pre - tension of    10 - 2 mN / m ( Figure 4 . 34 ) . 4 Results 92 Figure 4 . 34 : Lateral membrane tension of adhered GUVs on PEG - biotin - NeutrAvidin functionalized glass substrates after 15 min and 2 h , showing that the membrane tension did not change during that time . Lipid composition : DOPC / DOPS / Cholesterol / cap - biotin - DOPE / PIP 2 / Atto488 - DPPE ( 76 : 10 : 10 : 2 : 1 : 1 ) . Statistical Mann - Whitney U test : ns - not significant ( p = 0 . 2 ) . The lateral membrane tension of the adhered GUVs after subsidence was σ = ( 1 . 03 ± 0 . 04 ) ∙10 - 2 mN / m and after 2 h the membrane tension of the GUVs was de - termined with σ = ( 1 . 03 ± 0 . 03 ) ∙10 - 2 mN / m . The membrane tension of the GUVs did not changed significantly , indicating that the GUVs remained stable over time with quite low lateral membrane tensions of the adhered GUVs . Since the regulation of the lateral membrane tension of the GUVs was not able with MgCl 2 as it was previously done in the literature , 36 the ratio of m - PEG to b - PEG on the substrate surface was varied to verify , if the membrane tension can be controlled by this . Changing the ratio of m - PEG / b - PEG from 1 : 1 to 1 : 3 did not change r i / r ad of the vesicles ( Figure 4 . 35 ) . Hence , it was not possible to regulate the lateral membrane tension with the surface functionalization ( Figure 4 . 36 ) . 4 Results 93 Figure 4 . 35 : Ratio of the contact area radius and the adhered vesicle radius ( r i / r ad ) of the adhered GUVs ( DOPC / DOPS / Cholesterol / cap - biotin - DOPE / PIP 2 / Atto488 - DPPE ( 76 : 10 : 10 : 2 : 1 : 1 ) ) immobilized on PEG - Neutravidin functionalized glass with different ratios of b - PEG and m - PEG .

This shows that the membrane tension did not change by varying the PEG ratio . Statistical Mann - Whitney U test : ns - not significant ( p > 0 . 2 ) . 4 Results 94 For each surface functionalization 16 - 25 GUVs were evaluated . The membrane ten - sions were determined to be ( 1 . 02 ± 0 . 02 ) ∙10 - 2 mN / m ( m - PEG / b - PEG 1 : 1 ) , ( 1 . 03 ± 0 . 04 ) ∙10 - 2 mN / m ( m - PEG / b - PEG 1 : 2 ) and ( 1 . 02 ± 0 . 01 ) ∙10 - 2 mN / m ( m - PEG / b - PEG 1 : 3 ) . Although the membrane tension of the adhered GUVs could not be regulated by the surface functionalization , they showed stability over 2 h under iso - osmolar conditions . Therefore , ENTH was added to investigate the effect of the protein binding on the membrane tension . 4 . 4 . 3 Effect of ENTH addition to adhered GUVs Since the ratio of b - PEG and m - PEG showed no influence on the membrane tension of the adhered GUs , the following experiments were done with a ratio of 2 : 1 ( b - PEG / m - PEG ) . Moreover , it already was shown that with this ratio the PEG surface was cov - ered homogenously with NeutrAvidin . Adhered GUVs composed of DOPC / DOPS / Cholesterol / cap - biotin - DOPE / PIP 2 / Atto488 - DPPE ( 76 : 10 : 10 : 2 : 1 : 1 ) were incubated with 1 µM ENTH for 2 h . Every 30 min the solution was stirred to ensure a homogenous distribution of the protein . Afterwards , z - stacks of the ENTH incubated adhered GUVs were taken . Even though the amount of GUVs in the solution was not counted , it was obvious that less GUVs were found in the solution . Furthermore , a lot of lipid material was observed . Additionally imaging of the GUVs showed the rupture of the vesicles ( Figure 4 . 37 ) , indicating that the protein affects the vesicle stability . 4 Results 95 Figure 4 . 37 : Time series of one z - plane of an adhered GUV incubated with 1 µM ENTH ( 2 h ) . During imaging the vesicle ruptures . Lipid composition : DOPC / DOPS / Cholesterol / cap - biotin - DOPE / PIP 2 / Atto488 - DPPE ( 76 : 10 : 10 : 2 : 1 : 1 ) . Since the stability of the adhered GUVs without ENTH addition over 2 h was proven ( Figure 4 . 33 ) , rupturing of the GUVs seemed to be an effect of the ENTH binding to the PIP 2 doped GUVs . In order to investigate if lower concentration still affects the GUV stability , the ENTH concentration was decreased to 0 . 3 µM . Even at this ENTH concentration the adhered GUVs ruptured during imaging ( Figure 4 . 38 ) . Decreasing the laser intensity did not change this as well .

Lipid composition : DOPC / DOPS / Cholesterol / cap - biotin - DOPE / PIP 2 / Atto488 - DPPE ( 76 : 10 : 10 : 2 : 1 : 1 ) . These results showed that the adhered GUVs ruptured during incubation with 1 µM and 0 . 3 µM ENTH , indicating that the ENTH helix insertion induce the destabilization of adhered GUVs . 5 Discussion 97 5 D ISCUSSION To understand how the lipid composition influences the binding behavior of the epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain different artificial membrane models and tech - niques were utilized . Reflectometric interference spectroscopy ( RIfS ) measurements allow to analyze the adsorption of ENTH and its dissociation constant dependening on the lipid composition . Using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) the topology of the membrane surfaces with and without ENTH was analyzed . Moreover , the lipid de - pendent ENTH - PIP 2 interaction was analyzed by Langmuir - Blodgett trough experi - ments and fluorescence microscopy . Monolayer penetration experiments allowed to obtain information about the insertion capability of the protein into a monolayer with different lipid compositions by detecting surface pressure changes . Protein activity as a function of membrane tension was investigated on adhered GUVs . In this chapter the results described in chapter 4 were compared to the literature and discussed in more detail . 5 . 1 Characterization of the ENTH binding to PIP 2 containing solid supported membranes Phosphatidylinositol - ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) is the specific receptor lipid for the ENTH domain and consequently involved in the initial step of clathrin - mediated en - docytosis ( cf . chapter 1 . 1 ) . In literature , a 1 : 1 binding of ENTH to PIP 2 is described , which would predict a direct correlation of the amount of bound protein with the re - ceptor concentration . 7 Stahelin et al . already showed that at low PIP 2 concentration ( 0 . 5 % ) the dissociation constant drastically increases compared to higher PIP 2 con - tent ( 3 % ) . 25 However , an influence of the PIP 2 concentration on the ENTH - membrane interaction was not investigated systematically yet and would clarify the relevance of its amount in the cytosolic bilayer leaflet . 5 Discussion 98 5 . 1 . 1 Asymmetric distribution of PIP 2 in solid supported lipid bilayers and the influence on ENTH binding The binding behavior of ENTH to solid supported lipid bi - and monolayers was ana - lyzed using RIfS . To measure the influence of PIP 2 on the protein adsorption , planar and defect - free mono - and bilayers were required . For a pure POPC bilayer an optical thickness of Δ OT = 6 . 4 ± 0 . 2 nm was determined , which can be translated into a phys - ical membrane thickness of d M = 4 . 4 ± 0 . 2 nm ( equation ( 3 . 7 ) ) . Kŭcerke et al . meas - ured a physical thickness of d = 3 . 98 ± 0 . 08 nm for a POPC lipid bilayer . 88 Other stud - ies revealed membrane thicknesses of 3 . 68 - 4 . 60 nm , 130 – 132 which are in agreement with the determined physical thickness of the POPC bilayer in this work . Addition of PIP 2 did not change the thickness , ranging from 4 . 3 to 4 . 5 nm without a correlation to the PIP 2 content . The size of the PIP 2 head group implies that it pro - trudes into the aqueous area when the structure is erected . 44 , 98 These differences probably get lost in the detection range or in the errors of the measurements . Fur - thermore a possible hydration of the PIP 2 head group would change the refractive index . An increased refractive index abolishes its exposed character and impedes its detection ( cf . equation ( 3 . 7 ) ) . However hydration of lipid head groups already was shown to decrease the refractive index from ~ 1 . 47 to the refractive index of water ( n = 1 . 33 ) . Thus a limited detection range and the errors of the measurements seems more likely to detect significant changes of POPC and POPC / PIP 2 membranes . 133 Physical thicknesses of POPC / PIP 2 bilayers were previously measured via RIfS under the same conditions showing values in the same range . 79 , 134 This confirmed the suc - cessful formation of POPC and POPC / PIP 2 bilayers . On hydrophobic functionalized SiO 2 wafers spreading of SUVs resulted in monolayers ( cf . chapter 4 . 1 . 2 ) . For a POPC monolayer the physical thickness of d M = 1 . 6 ± 0 . 2 nm was determined . With increased PIP 2 concentration the d M - values stayed approxi - mately constant within the error margin . The physical thicknesses varied from 1 . 4 to 1 . 8 nm , but no tendency considering the PIP 2 content was observed . Since 4 nm of layer thickness is typical for a bilayer , monolayer thicknesses of about 2 nm are ex - pected . 88 , 130 Rossi et al . calculated an average thickness of 2 . 2 ± 0 . 3 nm for an egg - PC monolayer by means of surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy ( SPR ) . 135 The values 5 Discussion 99 in this work are slightly smaller . Minor variations can be explained by the different techniques and surface functionalization procedures . In general the RIfS experiments revealed the successful formation of bi - and monolayers on hydrophilized and hydro - phobic functionalized silicon surfaces , respectively . Besides the RIfS experiments , fluorescence images were taken to prove the homoge - neity and the mobility of the membranes . Therefore , the lipid bound fluorophore Texas Red ® 1 , 2 - dihexadecanoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoetanolamine ( TxR ) was used to stain the membrane . Spreading of SUVs on hydrophilic and hydrophobic function - alized SiO 2 substrates resulted in bi - and monolayer formation , respectively . The flu - orescence images of model membranes showed a predominant homogenous distri - bution of the fluorophore without significant defects . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments revealed that both systems were mobile , but the diffusion coefficients differed . For the POPC / TxR ( 99 . 5 / 0 . 5 ) and POPC / PIP 2 / TxR ( 99 . 5 - x / x / 0 . 5 , with x = 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 , 8 and 10 mol % ) bilayers diffusion coefficients of D = 1 . 8 - 2 . 5 µm 2 / s were measured with the FRAP method . Compared to that , the monolayers exhibited diffusion coefficients from D = 0 . 1 µm 2 / s to 0 . 4 µm 2 / s . In either case no correlation between the PIP 2 content and the diffusion constant was ob - served . Aditionally , the diffusion constant decreased from bi - to monolayers by a fac - tor of about 7 due to the interactions with the substrate . 136 Between the bilayer and the substrate surface a thin water layer of about 1 nm exists , reducing the interaction with the substrate compared to monolayers . 137 – 139 Braunger et al . determined diffusion coefficients of about 3 µm 2 / s for both , bi - and monolayers using tetramethylrhodamine - labeled PIP 2 . 97 However , they used a do - decyl - trichlorosilane based functionalization for the monolayers . The silane might in - teract less with the PIP 2 thereby explaining the same mobility of the fluorophore in bi - and monolayers . As they used labeled PIP 2 instead of TxR , the diffusion might also slightly differ . Furthermore , diffusion coefficients can be influenced by lipid composi - tion , lipid packing , temperature and substrate preparation 100 , 136 , 140 – 142 which could explain the differences . Baumann et al . measured diffusion coefficients of POPC / PIP 2 lipid bilayers showing the influence of PIP 2 on the mobility in the bottom leaflet . 143 Measurements with labeled POPC ( 1 - Palmitoyl - 2 - { 12 [ 7 - nitro - 2 - 1 , 3 - benzoxadiazol - 4 - yl ) amino ] dodecanoyl } - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine , NBD - POPC ) revealed diffusion 5 Discussion 100 constants of D = 1 . 84 - 2 . 46 µm 2 / s , comparable to the values observed in this thesis . They changed the PIP 2 content from 1 % to 10 % , which did not influence the mobility of NBD - POPC . Using labeled PIP 2 did not change D , but the mobile fractions were sig - nificantly reduced , indicating the interactions of PIP 2 with the substrate . Compared to that , the mobile fractions ( F m ) of NBD - POPC did not change ( F m = 84 - 91 % ) with varied PIP 2 content . In this work , the mobile fractions of TxR in the bilayers showed a slight decrease from 98± 1 % ( 2 mol % PIP 2 ) to 93 ± 1 ( 10 mol % PIP 2 ) in contrast to the monolayers with F m = 98 ± 2 % for all lipid compositions ( cf . Table 4 . 2 ) . The de - creased mobile fractions with increased PIP 2 concentration in the bilayers indicated a higher interaction of PIP 2 with the hydrophilic substrate . The head groups of the bilayer are mainly interacting with the substrate . PIP 2 consists of a larger and highly negatively charged head group compared to POPC ( Figure 5 . 1 ) . Increasing the con - centration hence can lead to an increased lipid - surface interaction compared to neu - tral lipids . 144 In the monolayers the increase of PIP 2 does not affect the mobility as only similar hydrocarbon chains were added . Figure 5 . 1 : Schematic illustration of the different interactions of lipids with substrate surfaces . In the monolayers the increase of PIP 2 does not affect the interactions between each other due to similar structures of the fatty acid chains . Compared to that increasing of the PIP 2 content in bilayers results in increased interactions of the PIP 2 lipid head groups . 5 Discussion 101 Baumann et al . also suggest that a larger hydration shell and charge repulsion of PIP 2 result in the reduced bilayer mobility . They also assume that interactions of pits in the negatively charged substrate and the head group lead to a reduction of the mobile fraction . 143 In this thesis the mobile fractions in the bilayers indicate a higher interaction between the substrate and the bottom leaflet with increased PIP 2 concentration . This may in - fluence the distribution of the receptor lipid within both leaflets of the membrane . Thus , the accessibility of PIP 2 for ENTH binding could be affected . Binding studies of ENTH to supported bilayers via RIfS were reported previously , 36 but the influence of the PIP 2 concentration is still not completely understood . For an exact analysis , the PIP 2 molecules have to be entirely accessible . Therefore , besides the experiments on bilayers , also RIfS measurements were performed on monolayers to see if the sub - strate surface influences the PIP 2 distribution . ENTH binding experiments ENTH binding experiments were performed in order to investigate the influence of the receptor lipid concentration on the binding affinity . Incubation of 1 µM ENTH to pure POPC bi - and monolayers proved the specificity of the ENTH - PIP 2 interaction as no increase of the Δ OT was observed after protein addition ( Figure 4 . 7 ) . Itoh et al . revealed by co - sedimentation assays that only in the presence of PIP 2 a high amount of ENTH binds to liposomes . Liposomes with other inositol species or negatively charged lipids showed a considerably decreased amount of bound protein or even no interaction . 24 Kweon et al . moreover elucidated with electron paramagnetic reso - nance ( EPR ) studies the importance of PIP 2 binding for the amphipathic helix for - mation . 145 After the blind experiment with pure POPC , the binding of ENTH to PIP 2 - containing bilayers was analyzed . At low PIP 2 concentrations almost no ENTH binding was visi - ble . An increase of the PIP 2 content led to higher Δ OT values indicating an increased ENTH binding to PIP 2 - containing bilayers . Binding of ENTH to PIP 2 and consequently conformational changes in the protein domain leads to the formation of a newly formed helix as well as a binding pocket for the receptor lipid . 25 Based on this a 1 : 1 5 Discussion 102 binding of ENTH to PIP 2 is assumed . This is in good agreement with the observed lin - ear increase in Δ OT with rising PIP 2 concentration ( cf . Figure 4 . 9 ) . Even at a PIP 2 con - centration of 10 mol % and a Δ OT ENTH of 1 . 2 + 0 . 4 nm no obvious saturation of the curve was observed indicating an incomplete protein occupancy on the surface . Nev - ertheless , it should be considered that with the RIfS technique the data is averaged over an area of 1 mm 2 . Inhomogeneities hence can lead to underestimation of the physical thickness . Although a homogenous PIP 2 distribution was observed by fluo - rescence microscopy previously , 79 , 97 , 134 it is possible that nanoscopic clusters of PIP 2 remained undetected . 22 These clusters would prevent a 1 : 1 stoichiometry due to the size of the protein . Besides this , interactions of the lipids with the surface can influ - ence the protein binding ( cf . Figure 5 . 1 ) . 136 Gleisner achieved full coverage of ENTH on POPC / PIP 2 ( 90 : 10 ) bilayers at a protein concentration of 3 µM using RIfS . At 1 µM a Δ OT of about 1 . 2 nm was determined , 79 thus the results in this work are consistent with the literature . As the values were obtained via RIfS , they should be comparable to the data in this thesis ( for c ( PIP 2 ) = 10 mol % ) shown in Figure 4 . 9 . Considering the crystal structure 22 and a maximum coverage of proteins ( 56 % ) according to the scaled particle theory , 146 a full coverage should be achieved at about Δ OT ENTH = 2 . 0 - 2 . 8 nm ( d ENTH = 1 . 4 - 2 . 0 nm ) , dependent on the orientation of the pro - tein on the surface . The crystal structure of the bound ENTH state is only known in the presence of the head group of PIP 2 , the inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( IP 3 ) . However , only binding to a membrane results in the formation of a stable amphipathic helix of ENTH 145 and consequently can also change the insertion and protein height . Moreo - ver , interactions of ENTH and PS also can lead to an altered protein structure . A full coverage of the protein was not yet reached at 10 mol % PIP 2 in a bilayer . PIP 2 has an area per molecule of about 0 . 7 nm 2 . With respect to the proteins footprint ( about 16 nm 2 ) 22 , 30 even in the presence of some small clusters , the surface would be completely covered at 10 mol % PIP 2 . This in turn shows that a certain amount of PIP 2 seems to be inaccessible . The FRAP experiments on bi - and monolayers , discussed in the previous section , also indicated the uneven distribution of PIP 2 in both leaflets of the bilayer . 5 Discussion 103 PIP 2 exhibits a larger head group than POPC and was shown to have an exposed posi - tion in the membrane . 44 , 147 Hence a high curvature in the SUV might provoke its loca - tion in the outer leaflet of the SUV . After spreading , the outer leaflet of the SUV is fac - ing to the surface , 148 resulting in the accumulation of PIP 2 in the bottom leaflet . This would support the assumption that some PIP 2 molecules are inaccessible for ENTH binding . In monolayers this asymmetric distribution of PIP 2 is prevented due to the missing second leaflet . For this reason ENTH binding experiments were repeated on PIP 2 - doped monolayers . Binding studies of ENTH to POPC / PIP 2 monolayers showed an increase of the optical thickness with increased lipid receptor concentration from Δ OT ENTH = 0 . 5 ± 0 . 1 nm ( 1 mol % PIP 2 ) to Δ OT ENTH = 2 . 2± 0 . 4 nm ( 10 mol % PIP 2 ) . Compared to bilayers the Δ OT ENTH values were about twice as high , indicating that PIP 2 is asymmetrically dis - tributed between both leaflets of a silicon supported bilayer . In Figure 5 . 2 a schematic illustration of the predicted protein occupancy on bi - and monolayers due to PIP 2 asymmetry is shown . Figure 5 . 2 : ( A ) Maximum change of the optical thickness upon ENTH binding to PIP 2 doped mono - ( green ) and bilayers ( black ) dependent on the PIP 2 content . ( B ) Schematic illustration of the PIP 2 dis - tribution within the mono - and bilayers and the influence on protein occupancy . As already mentioned a full protein coverage on the membrane surface is expected at Δ OT ENTH values of 2 . 0 – 2 . 8 nm . 22 , 146 For the monolayers Δ OT ENTH was measured to be 2 . 2 ± 0 . 4 nm . Although the results ( Figure 5 . 2 ) show no obvious saturation of the pro - 5 Discussion 104 tein occupancy at 10 mol % PIP 2 , a linear fit through the data indicates a slight over - estimation of the expected Δ OT ENTH value at this PIP 2 concentration . Within the error margins a saturation at 8 or 10 mol % PIP 2 cannot be excluded , thus together with the achieved Δ OT ENTH value an almost full coverage of ENTH on the monolayer can be im - plied . In both membrane systems , bi - and monolayer , a high reversibility of the protein binding was observed . For the bilayer 87 ± 24 % and for the monolayer 75 ± 14 % of the protein bound reversibly . A high reversibility of the ENTH binding ensures the dissociation from the clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCV , cf . chapter 1 . 1 ) during CME , with the result that recycled proteins are available for the next circle of the process . 1 , 12 Hence , the obtained high reversibility in the RIfS experiments are reasonable with regard to the process occurring in biological membranes . The results show that the amount of bound protein is highly regulated by the PIP 2 concentration . A linear correlation between the protein occupancy and the PIP 2 con - tent furthermore support the assumed 1 : 1 binding of ENTH to PIP 2 due to the for - mation of a PIP 2 binding pocket within the protein . 5 . 1 . 2 PS dependent binding affinity of ENTH to lipid bilayers Besides PIP 2 also PS seems to have an influence on the ENTH - membrane interac - tion . 8 , 26 This effect was also investigated by means of RIfS . Since the addition of other lipids can change the membrane properties , the formation of POPC / POPS ( 80 : 20 ) and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) bilayers was analyzed . Membrane thicknesses of d = 4 . 2 ± 0 . 1 nm and d = 4 . 3 ± 0 . 2 nm were measured for membranes with and with - out PIP 2 , respectively . Experiments with POPC and POPC / PIP 2 ( 95 : 5 ) lipid composi - tions exhibited membrane thicknesses of d = 4 . 4 ± 0 . 2 nm and d = 4 . 5 ± 0 . 3 nm show - ing that there was no influence of the PS lipid head group on the membrane thickness . POPC / POPS ( 75 : 25 ) bilayer thicknesses of 3 . 81 ± 0 . 60 nm were previously measured using dual polarization interferometry . 149 The values in this work are similar to those within the error margins indicating the successful formation of a bilayer . 5 Discussion 105 Furthermore , fluorescence images showed a homogenous distribution of TxR in the POPC / POPS ( 80 : 20 ) and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) bilayers . Using FRAP , diffusion coefficients of D = 1 . 9 ± 0 . 3 µm 2 / s ( without PS ) and D = 1 . 3 ± 0 . 4 µm 2 / s ( with PS ) were determined . Increasing the negative charge decreased the mobility , but consid - ering the error margins the differences were negligible . The same trend is observed for the mobile fractions . Without PS the mobile fraction of TxR in the bilayers was F m = 86 ± 8 % . Increasing the negative charge with PS decreased the mobile fraction to F m = 77 ± 4 % . Zhang et al . measured the diffusion coefficient of fluorescent probes with different net charges in biofilms . The negatively charged probes diffused more slowly , which was ascribed to the electrostatic repulsion of the probes with the biofilms . 144 Electrostatic repulsion of the negative charges PIP 2 and PS also can affect the mobility of TxR in the bilayers . In conclusion , mobile and homogenous bilayers composed of POPC / POPS ( 80 : 20 ) and POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) were generated , enabling the investigation of the ENTH adsorption to these bilayers . Influence of PS on ENTH binding In order to investigate if ENTH binds specifically to PIP 2 , ENTH was added to POPC / POPS ( 80 : 20 ) bilayers lacking PIP 2 , showing no binding of ENTH to PS . Hom et al . performed liposome binding assays with POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) vesicles and showed specific binding of the ENTH domain to PIP 2 . 8 In the absence of PIP 2 the do - main did not associate with the vesicles , even though PS was present . These results were also supported by co - sedimentation assays performed by Itoh et al . No binding of ENTH to negatively charged lipids , like phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , was observed . Fur - thermore less or even no binding of ENTH occurred to other phosphatidylinositol species . 24 The results in this thesis showed that the dissociation constant of ENTH to PIP 2 in the presence of PS decreased from K D = 1 . 0 ± 0 . 2 µM ( POPC / PIP 2 ( 95 : 5 ) ) to K D = 0 . 42 ± 0 . 05 µM ( POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) ) . Moreover a higher protein occu - pancy was observed when PS was present ( Δ OT ENTH , max = 2 . 5 ± 0 . 1 nm compared to 5 Discussion 106 1 . 6 ± 0 . 1 nm ) . This indicates that PIP 2 is necessary for the binding of ENTH to mem - branes , however PS decreased the dissociation constant of ENTH to PIP 2 doped bi - layers and increased the protein occupancy on them . Gleisner et al . measured K D values by means of SPR , RIfS and spinning disc confocal laser microscopy ( SDCLM ) . 36 , 79 RIfS experiments revealed a K D of 0 . 8±0 . 8 µM for POPC / PIP 2 ( 90 : 10 ) . The K D value is similar to the value obtained in this thesis via RIfS . With densitometry analysis of SDS - PAGE Hom et al . revealed that vesicles ( diame - ter ≈ 1 µm ) composed of POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 ( 63 : 20 : 15 : 2 ) bound more ENTH than POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 78 : 20 : 2 ) vesicles indicating the influence of PS on the ENTH - PIP 2 interaction . 8 With SPR experiments they furthermore measured K D values of 20 ± 2 . 4 nM in presence of PS and 80 ± 11 nM when PS was absent , both at a pH of 7 . 4 , mimicking the natural pH of mammalian cells . 150 In this thesis the K D values were larger than the K D values obtained by Hom et al . 8 Recruitment of hydrophobic do - mains to curved membranes is preferred due to the higher binding site density and thus might explain the differences in the binding affinity . 151 – 153 However , Hom et al . observed that PS clearly enhanced the amount of bound ENTH to PIP 2 - containing membranes supporting the result obtained in this work . 8 Addition of PS clearly in - creased the binding affinity of ENTH to PIP 2 - containing membranes ( Figure 4 . 14 ) . Various other studies revealed values from 0 . 02 to 6 µM using fluorescence micros - copy , SPR or isothermal titration calorimetry ( cf . Appendix , Table 10 . 3 ) . 8 , 21 , 25 , 28 , 36 , 79 , 154 , 155 The dissociation constants determined in this thesis are com - parable to the values in literature . PS is localized at the cytosolic side of mammalian plasma membranes , 37 where ENTH binds to , 156 hence a contribution to the protein - membrane interaction is theoretically conceivable . Stahelin et al . suggested that non - specific interactions of ENTH with neg - ative charges recruit the ENTH to the membrane which enables binding of ENTH to PIP 2 . 25 Binding leads to conformational changes in the protein which also could ex - plain that PS only has an effect on ENTH binding when PIP 2 is present ( Figure 4 . 13 ) . Otherwise , in the absence of PIP 2 , no ENTH binding was observed . Thus , PS could en - hance the recruitment and subsequently the binding affinity of ENTH . One explana - tion could be that due to ENTH - PIP 2 interaction a binding site for PS gets accessible or non - specific interactions with positive protein residues facilitate the binding . Since 5 Discussion 107 in the presence of PS a higher protein occupancy on the bilayer was observed , the question arises if besides the helix insertion a crowding mechanism can contribute to a higher amount of bound protein in the presence of PS ( Figure 5 . 3 ) . Figure 5 . 3 : Schematic illustration of the ENTH crowding mechanism . The assembly of several ENTH monomers increases the protein occupancy on PS containing membranes in a PIP 2 dependent manner . Kroppen showed with co - sedimentation assays that ENTH tends to form homo - oligo - mers in the presence of PS 26 explaining the higher Δ OT ENTH , max values ( Figure 4 . 15 ) . Protein - protein interactions can lead to higher surface occupancies or to stacked pro - tein clusters . Both would increase the optical thickness . However , with RIfS experi - ments the formation of clusters cannot be observed . PS induced ENTH cluster formation Since PS showed an influence on the ENTH occupancy , AFM experiments were per - formed to obtain information about the surface topology after ENTH adsorption . Due to the comparability with the literature 26 , 36 , 151 the lipid composition was changed to DOPC / DOPE / PIP 2 / TxR ( 64 . 9 : 30 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) and DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( 44 . 9 : 30 : 20 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) . AFM experiments to investigate protein adsorption were previ - osly performed with DOPC membranes , 157 , 158 showing the applicability for this anal - ysis . Beforehand , FRAP experiments proved the mobility of these defect free membranes ( Figure 4 . 19 ) with a D = 2 . 5 ± 0 . 6 µm 2 / s ( without PS ) and D = 1 . 7 ± 0 . 4 µm 2 / s ( with PS ) , typical for bilayers composed of DOPC and DOPC / DOPS . 159 – 161 The decreased D value is explainable with the increased negative charges of PS in combination with 5 Discussion 108 PIP 2 interacting with the hydrophilic surface . 136 , 143 Breakthrough experiments addi - tionally verified the formation of bilayers with a membrane thickness of about 4 nm , indicating the successful formation of mobile bilayers . 162 Incubation with 1 µM ENTH led to a significant decrease of the membrane mobility resulting in diffusion constants of D = 0 . 6 ± 0 . 2 µm 2 / s and D = 0 . 3 ± 0 . 2 µm 2 / s in ab - sence and in presence of PS , respectively . Reduction of the lateral lipid diffusion is often observed when proteins bind to membranes . 110 , 163 – 165 Due to binding of pro - teins , lipids diffuse slower in a protein - lipid complex . Hence decreased diffusion of ENTH - PIP 2 complexes can affect the lateral diffusion of TxR in the bilayers . In the atomic force micrographs ( Figure 4 . 17 ) , structures with an average height of 1 . 2 ± 0 . 2 nm were observed in the presence of PS indicating the adsorption of ENTH . The protein occupancy of 6 ± 1 % indicates that only a minor amount of the protein is detected by AFM . Furthermore , no protein clusters were observed in in the absence of PS . At first sight this contradicts the results obtained with RIfS . Although the lipids differ , the head groups are the same and consequently the occupancy should not be affected that much . Previous studies also revealed similar binding behaviors of ENTH to membrane systems composed of POPC or DOPC . 36 , 154 The low occupancy moreover could be explained by the high reversibility of the ENTH binding detected via RIfS ( Table 10 . 2 ) . During imaging in contact mode lateral shear forces from the tip occurring to the sample can harm or detach the protein . 166 The movement of the cantilever over the sample , hence , could shift the ENTH over the sample ( Figure 5 . 4 ) . This would also explain that no proteins were observed on the membrane in the absence of PS . Thus only PS induced ENTH clusters , which were rigid enough to be scanned in contact mode , were clearly imaged , causing an under - estimation of the protein occupancy . 5 Discussion 109 Figure 5 . 4 : Cantilever movement in contact mode during imaging of ( A ) ENTH monomers and ( B ) ENTH clusters . Due to the mobile character of ENTH monomers the cantilever shifts the protein over the sample preventing the imaging of single monomers in contrast to immobile clusters . EPR studies performed by Lai et al . indicated an immobilization of the protein due to close proximity of adjacent ENTH monomers , supporting the assumption that the ag - gregates in the micrographs are immobile and consequently only these were de - tected . 110 They furthermore hypothesized that ENTH dimers or larger aggregates can occur dependent on the local membrane morphologies . Curvature facilitates the ag - gregation explaining the minor amount of visible clusters in the micrographs of pla - nar solid supported bilayers . Previous studies furthermore showed that ENTH tends to form homo - oligomers in the presence of PS . 26 Exchanging PS against phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) to mimic the negative charge 167 did not lead to oligomers . Hence , this supports the assumption that the cluster formation is induced by PS and not only by negative charges . Although imaging in contact mode obtained low protein occupancies , other imaging modes were unsuitable for this system due to the appearance of inversion ef - fects . 168 , 169 Imaging in tapping mode yielded micrographs , where dark structures in the bilayers were detected . Micrographs obtained in contact mode however revealed 5 Discussion 110 that these dark structures were attributed to ENTH clusters and were a result of the inverted image contrast . In Figure 5 . 5 atomic force micrographs of a DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( 44 . 9 : 30 : 20 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) bilayer after incubation with 1 µM ENTH obtained by QI - , tapping - and contact mode are illustrated . Rahe et al . observed inversion of the image contrast of protruded adsorbates on mica and TiO 2 in tapping mode depending on the amplitude of the cantilever oscillation and the damping level of the cantilever . 170 Changed attraction of cantilever and adsorbate caused a phase shift of driving force and driven oscillation and consequently incorrect readout of the height . Hence in this work the different interactions between the cantilever with the bilayer and the protein could have led to the inverted contrast in the micrograph dur - ing imaging in tapping mode and consequently prevented the analysis of protein heights with this imaging mode . Figure 5 . 5 : Atomic force micrographs of a DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( 44 . 9 : 30 : 20 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) bilayer af - ter incubation with 1 µM ENTH obtained by three different imaging modi : QI - , tapping and contact mode . The yellow squares highlight one part of the micrographs to underscore differences . Only when the measurements were performed in contact mode bright cluster structures were observed . Due to the inversion of the image contrast the ENTH clusters falsely were detected as membrane defects . The atomic force micrographs obtained in contact mode ( Figure 4 . 17 and Figure 5 . 5 ) clearly showed that PS induced the formation of ENTH cluster . The height of these clusters was determined to be 1 . 2 ± 0 . 2 nm which is smaller than reported in litera - ture . 22 Considering the crystal structure of ENTH at least a protein height of 2 . 0 - 2 . 8 nm was expected . Due to this , the bilayer surface was investigated by fluorescence microscopy to exclude ENTH binding to defects ( Figure 4 . 19 ) . Binding of ENTH to de - fects would lead to an underestimated protein height . To ensure that these defects 5 Discussion 111 moreover did not appear during the membrane aging process , the bilayers were in - cubated in buffer for two hours and then imaged again showing no defects . In all cases , with or without PS , no visible defects were observed before and after ENTH addition or in the absence of ENTH after 2h . Hence the low protein height is not re - sulting from binding to defects and consequently the clusters were attributed to pro - tein adsorption to PIP 2 doped membranes in the presence of PS . The crystal structure of the bound ENTH is only known in the presence of inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) ( head group of PIP 2 ) and not when it is bound to the recep - tor lipid PIP 2 . Although binding of ENTH to IP 3 alone results in the formation of the ENTH helix , it is not stable outside the membrane . When ENTH binds to a PIP 2 doped membrane , the helix is stabilized which would facilitate its insertion into the inner leaflet ( Figure 5 . 6 ) . 145 Figure 5 . 6 : Schematic illustration of the different interactions of ( A ) IP 3 bound ENTH and ENTH bound to a PIP 2 doped membrane . Only when ENTH is bound to the membrane the helix is stabilized , which could lead to a slightly thinner protein layer on the bilayer surface compared to the assumed protein height from the crystal structure . 21 , 145 This would lead to an underestimation of the detected protein height compared to the values evaluated from the crystal structure . However , previous studies determined the physical thickness of ENTH via RIfS , yielding d ENTH = 1 . 7 ± 0 . 2 nm . 79 Similar values were also obtained in this thesis by means of RIfS . Assuming a maximum of the pro - tein height of 56 % according to the scaled particle theory the actual height increases to 3 . 0 nm . 146 , 171 The differences in the protein heights are mainly explainable by the 5 Discussion 112 used techniques . The protein heights of 1 . 2 ± 0 . 2 nm in this thesis were obtained by means of AFM in contact mode . During imaging in contact mode indentation of the protein with the cantilever can underestimate the protein height ( Figure 5 . 7 A ) . 166 Furthermore altered interactions of protein with the bilayer , e . g due to increase of the negative charge by PS , could affect the orientation and structure of the bound protein . This would result in a slightly different protein height compared to the protein height obtained from the crystal structure or with other techniques and lipid compositions ( Figure 5 . 7 B and C ) . 22 , 79 Also other proteins , like synaptotagmin - 1 , showed different orientations with respect to PIP 2 - containing membranes when PS is present . 53 Since the presence of PS was shown to decrease the dissociation constant and increase the protein occupancy ( cf . chapter 4 . 2 . 2 ) on the bilayer , altered interactions with the bi - layer surface seems reasonable . Thus , the observed structures were attributed to ENTH clusters . Figure 5 . 7 : Predicted protein heights of ENTH for different conditions . ( A ) ENTH bound to PIP2 - doped membranes . ( B ) ENTH bound membranes containing PIP 2 and PS . ( C ) Indentation of the ENTH bound to PIP 2 / PS membranes by the cantilever . Due to lipid dependent protein - membrane interactions the protein height can change . Moreover imaging in AFM can indent the protein resulting in the detection of a decreased protein height . The results clearly show that PS has a significant impact on the binding behavior of ENTH to PIP 2 doped membranes . First , the dissociation constant of ENTH to those bilayers is decreased and the protein occupancy on the surface increased . Moreover the AFM experiments revealed that PS induces the formation of ENTH clusters in the 5 Discussion 113 presence of PIP 2 . Hence , this shows that not only PIP 2 regulates the recruitment of ENTH to the membrane , but also PS highly affects the binding structure of ENTH to membranes . 5 . 1 . 2 . 1 The ENTH R114A mutant There are different regions within the ENTH domain involved in protein - protein and protein - lipid interactions . Especially the amino acid R114 was found to interact with the membrane and to be involved in the formation of ENTH homo - oligomers . 26 , 110 Lai et al . performed coarse - grained molecular dynamics ( CG - MD ) simulation and EPR ex - periments with the ENTH domain . Their results indicated an interaction of the amino acid R114 , located in the unstructured loop between helix 6 and helix 7 , with the membrane . 110 This interaction further recruits ENTH and stabilizes the ENTH mem - brane docking geometry . Hence , the amino acid R114 can be involved in the cluster formation of ENTH . In order to investigate the role of the amino acid R114 in the formation of clusters , as observed in the presence of PS ( Figure 4 . 17 ) , RIfS and AFM experiments were per - formed with the mutant R114A . The results showed a decreased dissociation coeffi - cient of the mutant on POPC / POPS / PIP 2 bilayers and a higher protein occupancy on the membrane compared to bilayers lacking PS . Furthermore similar surface occu - pancies of ENTH R114A and ENTH wt were determined indicating that the mutant is still binding to PIP 2 doped membranes . However , the dissociation constant of the mu - tant significantly increased compared to the wt showing the contribution of the amino acid R114 in the binding process of ENTH . The obtained values for the ENTH wt and mutant are listed in Table 5 . 1 . 5 Discussion 114 Table 5 . 1 : Summary of the fit results of the Langmuir adsorption isotherms for ENTH wt and ENTH R114A . The values are given as parameter ± SE . lipid composition K D Δ OT ENTH , max ENTH wt ENTH R114A ENTH wt ENTH R114A POPC / PIP 2 ( 95 : 5 ) 1 . 0 ± 0 . 2 µM 2 . 9 ± 0 . 8 µM 1 . 6 ± 0 . 1 nm 1 . 5 ± 0 . 2 nm POPC / POPS / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) 0 . 42 ± 0 . 05 µM 1 . 0 ± 0 . 3 µM 2 . 5 ± 0 . 1 nm 2 . 7 ± 0 . 2 nm In general , the dissociation constants lie within the same range as the values found in literature ( cf . Appendix , Table 10 . 3 ) . Stahelin et al . mutated the ENTH domain at dif - ferent positions . Mutations , like L6Q and M10Q strongly affected the binding affinity and the penetration ability into monolayers as these amino acids were localized in the α 0 helix . 25 The R114A mutant in turn exhibited a decreased dissociation constant compared to the wt , but showed a similar penetration ability into POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) as the ENTH wt . This amino acid is not located at the PIP 2 binding site , but the close contact to the membrane facilitates the contribution in non - specific electro - static interactions . 23 , 25 , 110 Lack of the positively charged protein residue ( R114 ) or the negatively charged PS in the membrane led to a decreased binding affinity ( Figure 4 . 21 ) and hence support the assumption that the amino acid R114 is involved in further recruitment of ENTH when PS was present . As the occupancy of ENTH R114A in presence of PS was similar to that of ENTH wt ( cf . Table 5 . 1 ) , it seems likely that still interactions of PS and the mutant occur in a PIP 2 dependent manner , but ENTH clustering is prevented ( Figure 4 . 22 ) . Although the K D of the mutant is higher as the value for the ENTH wt , the mo - bility of single ENTH R114A molecules seemed to be higher than the mobility of the ENTH wt clusters , hence the resolution of individual ENTH R114A monomers ( and also individual ENTH wt monomers in the absence of PS , Figure 4 . 17 ) in contact mode was not possible . Previous studies revealed the contribution of the amino acid R114 of ENTH in recruit - ment and membrane deformation . Kroppen showed that the mutation of this amino 5 Discussion 115 acid did not change the molecular structure of ENTH and still was binding to the mem - brane in presence of PIP 2 and PS . 26 However , the ability to form tubular structures got lost proving the importance of this amino acid . 26 Moreover , co - sedimentation as - says revealed the contribution of R114 in homo - oligomer formation . To investigate if the mutant also prevents cluster formation on solid - supported membranes , AFM ex - periments were performed . In all cases ( DOPC / DOPE / PIP 2 / TxR ( 64 . 9 : 30 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) and DOPC / DOPE / DOPS / PIP 2 / TxR ( 44 . 9 : 30 : 20 : 5 : 0 . 1 ) ) homogenous and planar bilayers with a roughness of 152±7 pm ( without PS ) and 197±47 pm ( with PS ) were observed after the incubation with ENTH R114A . Even in the presence of PS no clusters ap - peared ( Figure 4 . 22 ) meaning that the lack of the arginine in position 114 prevented the formation of clusters . This also shows that the presence of PS and the amino acid R114 are required for the cluster formation which also can indicate an interaction of PS and R114 . Yoon et al . already revealed that interactions between two ENTH monomers can oc - cur in the presence of PIP 2 and PS . 28 Although they did not investigate the impact of PS , they performed vesicle binding studies with GUVs composed of POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 / Rh - PE ( 46 . 5 : 30 : 20 : 0 . 5 , Rh - PE = 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycerol - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - ( lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl ) ) showing the appear - ance of tubulation induced by ENTH crowding . This was attributed to the interaction of K23 and E42 of two ENTH monomers . When the amino acids were mutated ( K23E and E42K ) the ENTH lost the ability to induce tubulations . Their vesicle binding stud - ies were supported by EPR studies which indicated an interaction of two α 0 helices ( ENTH wt ) in an antiparallel manner meaning a well - ordered clustering of the pro - teins . In combination with the results observed in this thesis , a contribution of PS and R114 in the accessibility of the amino acids K23 and E42 for protein - protein interac - tions ( Figure 5 . 9 ) seems likely . 5 Discussion 116 Figure 5 . 8 : Orientation and interactions of two ENTH monomers in the ( A ) absence and ( B ) presence of PS . When PS is lacking less ENTH - membrane interactions occur . Due to the presence of PS interac - tions of ENTH with the membrane increase . Changed penetration depth and angles can lead to a facil - itated interaction of K23 and E42 resulting in cluster formation . Yoon et al . furthermore determined the insertion depth of the ENTH helix ( usually 13 Å 2 from the phosphate group ) as well as the penetration angle of the helix ( 11° to the membrane normal ) in the presence of PS . 28 Lack of PS and / or R114 may change the orientation of the helix in the membrane which could lead to a different accessi - bility of the amino acids K23 and E42 for protein - protein interactions . Consequently less or no clusters were formed preventing imaging by AFM due to the mobile char - acter of ENTH monomers ( cf . chapter 5 . 1 . 2 ) . In summary , it can be stated that interactions of the amino acid R114 with the mem - brane or / and other ENTH monomers in the presence of PS are involved in the ENTH cluster formation . 5 . 2 Lipid dependent penetration ability of ENTH to lipid monolay - ers Binding of ENTH to membranes illustrates the initial step of clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis ( cf . chapter 1 . 1 ) . As the ENTH - PIP 2 binding leads to the formation of a newly formed α 0 helix which can insert into the inner leaflet of the membrane , penetration experiments can help to understand the role of different lipids in this process . In the previous chapters , the importance of PIP 2 and PS on the membrane recruitment and cluster formation was discussed . To analyze if these lipids also have an effect on the 5 Discussion 117 penetration ability of ENTH , the influence of PIP 2 and PS on lipid packing densities and the protein surface activity will be discussed in more detail . 5 . 2 . 1 Receptor lipid dependent penetration ability of ENTH In order to investigate the lipid packing of monolayers composed of POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) and POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 80 - x : 20 : x , with x = 1 , 5 , 10 mol % ) , isotherms were recorded . The results show that the isotherms were shifted to smaller area per mole - cule values with increased PIP 2 content . It has to be considered that the area per mol - ecule values ( A M ) was averaged over all lipids in the ratio of their molecular fraction . The monolayers of POPC / POPE lacking PIP 2 showed a similar compression behavior as the monolayer with 5 mol % PIP 2 . Although the fatty acid chains of PIP 2 molecules in sum exhibit lower degree of saturation than the fatty acid chains of POPC or POPE , 44 different studies revealed similar area per molecule values for PIP 2 and POPC at 30 mN / m ( about 70 Å 2 ) . 172 – 175 Furthermore , it could be assumed that the negatively charged head group of PIP 2 should increase the lipid packing due to electrostatic re - pulsion . 173 However , despite the negative charges , PIP 2 molecules can form hydrogen bonds which counteract the repulsion of the negative charge . 176 , 177 This would explain that the area per molecule values of POPC and PIP 2 are in the same range . Moreover , the increase in the PIP 2 content could increase the amount of hydrogen bond , leading to a higher lipid packing and a shift of the isotherms to smaller area per molecule values . Besides the increased amount of hydrogen bonds , the shift in the surface pressure - area per molecule diagram can also be an effect of decreased amounts of lipids in the monolayer as they submerge into the subphase . If more PIP 2 molecules submerge into the subphase , less molecules would be available for ENTH - PIP 2 interactions within the monolayers . Hence the critical surface pressure and consequently the penetration ability could be underestimated . In general , no collapse of monolayers composed of pure POPC , POPE or PIP 2 until a surface pressure of 31 mN / m was observed in the literature . 172 – 174 , 178 , 179 In this work , only the isotherms of POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 79 : 20 : 1 ) monolayers showed irregularities 5 Discussion 118 or even collapsed between 27 - 31 mN / m . This means that the critical surface pressure seems to be in this region and that further compression is not possible due to mono - layer collapse . 180 Furthermore , the area per molecule molecule per area ( A m ) of the lipids in the POPC / POPE monolayers was slightly lower compared to the A m in the 1 mol % PIP 2 monolayer which would support the assumption that a certain amount of PIP 2 is necessary for the formation of stable hydrogen bonds . Thus , collapse ap - peared earlier even with a looser lipid packing compared to monolayers with 5 and 10 mol % PIP 2 ( Figure 4 . 23 ) . It is only possible to measure the penetration ability of ENTH when the monolayer stability is ensured . Especially the experiments with PIP 2 required the monolayer sta - bility to guarantee that enough PIP 2 molecules were accessible for interactions with the protein . Johnston et al . assumed the stability of different phospholipid monolay - ers when the decay rate did not exceed 1 mN / m per minute . 115 Penetration experi - ments were only performed with POPC / POPE monolayers as monolayers composed of DOPC and DOPC / DOPE were not stable ( data not shown ) . The decay rate in this work was smaller compared to Johnston et al . ( decay rate < 1 . 5 mN / m per hour ) for all used lipid mixtures . Although submerging of lipids into the subphase cannot be excluded completely , the monolayers were stable over 1 h once 30 mN / m was reached . This enabled the performance of monolayer penetration experiments . ( cf . sections 3 . 3 . 5 and 4 . 3 . 1 ) . After addition of the protein , the surface pressure ( π ) changed dependent on the ini - tial value ( π 0 ) . This increase is attributed to the insertion of the α 0 helix . 181 The change in surface pressure ( Δ π ) was inversely proportional to π 0 , whereby the critical surface pressure ( π c ) was determined as the x - intercept . 182 , 183 As the increments of π often were irregular , no rate constants could be calculated . These irregularities were also found in penetration experiments with different proteins 184 , 185 and were attributed to the uneven distribution of the ENTH in the subphase . In this setup , the mixing of the subphase after protein addition was only possible with a syringe , otherwise the monolayer was disturbed . Thus , distribution of the protein mainly took place by dif - fusion , which also increased the time to reach Δ π max . Stahelin et al . e . g . used another Langmuir - Blodgett trough setup where a stirrer was used to achieve a homogenous distribution of the protein in the subphase . 25 They 5 Discussion 119 monitored Δ π at a stirrer velocity of 60 rpm reaching a maximum after 20 min . In contrast to that , Δ π max here was reached after 10 - 120 min which could be explained by the different techniques to distribute the protein in the subphase . Previous exper - iments determined a critical surface pressure of π c = 21 mN / m for a POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) monolayer . 8 , 25 Also changes in the pH of the buffer did not influence the pen - etration ability essentially . In this thesis , ENTH also showed a poor penetration ability into POPC / POPE monolayers with π c = 23 . 3 ± 0 . 8 mN / m . As cell membranes and large unilamellar vesicles exhibit similar lipid packing densities compared to Lang - muir - Blodgett monolayers at surface pressures in a range of 30 - 35 mN / m , 113 , 114 , 186 the protein is only able to penetrate natural bilayer if π c exceeds 30 mN / m . This in turn means that the ENTH domain is not able to penetrate POPC / POPE bilayers which is reasonable as the ENTH helix is only formed in the presence PIP 2 . 21 For monolayers with PIP 2 , π c increased showing an influence of the receptor lipid on the surface activity of the protein . For monolayers with 1 mol % PIP 2 , π c slightly in - creased ( π c = 24 . 1 ± 0 . 8 mN / m ) , but within the error of the measurements it was not significantly different . At 10 mol % PIP 2 , π c changed to 28 . 7 ± 0 . 6 mN / m and at 5 mol % to 30 . 3 ± 0 . 4 mN / m . In both cases the π c value was approximately around 30 mN / m , indicating a high penetration capability into these monolayers . Hence , this means that ENTH is a membrane - active protein domain capable of penetrating the membrane when a certain amount of PIP 2 is present . π c changed from 24 . 1 ± 0 . 8 mN / m for 1 mol % PIP 2 to values aroun 30 mN / m for 5 and 10 mol % PIP 2 showing that the penetration ability of ENTH is a function of the PIP 2 content . Furthermore , there is the possibility that for 1 mol % PIP 2 molecules submerge into the subphase during compression , resulting in less ENTH binding and penetration into the monolayer . In some cases , the isotherms of the monolayers with 1 mol % PIP 2 showed a collapse at high surface pressures and this would support the assumption . A maximum of π c was observed when ENTH was added to monolayers containing 5 mol % PIP 2 . Since at higher PIP 2 concentrations more ENTH - PIP 2 inter - actions are expected due to previous results via RIfS ( cf . chapter 4 . 1 . 3 ) , the lipid pack - ing could diminish a further insertion of the helix at 10 mol % PIP 2 ( Figure 5 . 9 A ) . Moreover it is possible that PIP 2 molecules submerged into the subphase or that PIP 2 5 Discussion 120 clusters could prevent the accessibility for ENTH binding ( Figure 5 . 9 B and C ) . In all cases a reduced penetration of the ENTH helix would result . Figure 5 . 9 : Schematic illustration of the ENTH penetration into monolayers composed of POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 70 : 20 : 10 ) . Three penetration mechanisms , which would explain the limited helix penetration into those monolayers , are conceivable : ( A ) Insertion is prevented due to the dense lipid packing . ( B ) PIP 2 clusters diminish the accessibility for ENTH binding . ( C ) PIP 2 molecules submerge into the subphase preventing the ENTH - PIP 2 binding within the monolayer . Stahelin et al . and Hom et al . determined π c values of 32 mN / m and 31 mN / m for POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 77 : 20 : 3 ) and POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 78 : 20 : 2 ) monolayers at pH 7 . 4 . 8 , 25 Hom et al . moreover showed that at pH of 6 π c decreased to 34 . 5 mN / m which was attributed to the facilitated ENTH binding to PIP 2 due to protonation of histidine res - idues ( H73 and H43 ) in the protein . The experiments in this work were performed at pH 7 . 4 and therefore the measured π c values are in good agreement with the litera - ture , although the Δ π values at lower initial surface pressures were slightly smaller . Stahelin et al . used 3 mol % PIP 2 and Hom et al . 2 mol % PIP 2 instead of 5 mol % PIP 2 which could explain the small differences . 8 , 25 Moreover , even small changes in tem - perature and pH can lead to changes in the surface pressure due to the high sensitivity and also can affect the measurements . 187 Although the experiments with POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 79 : 20 : 1 ) monolayers showed a poor penetration ability of ENTH , RIfS measurements indeed showed specific binding of ENTH to supported POPC / PIP 2 ( 99 : 1 ) monolayers with Δ OT = 0 . 5 ± 0 . 1 nm ( cf . Fi - gure 4 . 9 ) . One possibility for this difference could be the stabilization of the mono - layer by the used substrate and consequently a higher amount of accessible PIP 2 . On the other hand , the ENTH domain is recruited to POPC / POPE / PIP 2 monolayers ( and POPC / PIP 2 monolayer for RIfS ) , but only a minor amount of the proteins penetrated 5 Discussion 121 them . This would explain the low π c of ENTH to 1 mol % PIP 2 monolayers . Further - more , the protein penetration is only feasible up to an upper limit of the molecular packing . Many studies reported an optimum of the surface pressure in enzyme veloc - ity and also the influence of the lipid packing density on protein penetration . 188 – 191 Hence , this could support the assumption that the lipid packing in monolayers with 10 mol % prevents further helix insertion . In conclusion , the results show that PIP 2 has a high impact on the penetration ability of ENTH as πc significantly increases for monolayers . 5 . 2 . 2 PS dependent penetration ability of ENTH Lipids with charged head groups like PS can have essential impact on different pro - tein - membrane interactions . 192 , 193 One example is the protein domain ENTH , whose binding affinity is increased in presence of PS ( cf . chapter 4 . 2 ) . Moreover , it was shown that PS induces the formation of ENTH clusters ( Figure 4 . 17 ) . In order to investigate if PS can additionally affect the penetration ability of ENTH , Langmuir - Blodgett through measurements were performed . First , the compression behavior of monolayers in presence and absence of PS was analyzed . No differences in the isotherms were observed when the subphase was changed from water to HEPES buffer , even though the ionic strength can have an influence on the lipid pack - ing . 173 , 194 Furthermore no collapse of the monolayer was detected until the surface pressure of 32 mN / m . The monolayers lacking PS showed denser lipid packing ( Figure 4 . 28 ) than the other monolayers with PS as they were shifted to lower area per molecule values . Addition of PIP 2 to the PS monolayer even increased the area per molecule due to the incremented negative charges . These negative charges can repulse each other , 195 which would increase the area per molecule . Although PIP 2 molecules can form inter - molecular hydrogen bonds among themselves and counteract the negative repul - sion 173 , 174 the additional negative charges of PS seemed to diminish this counterac - tion . 5 Discussion 122 As all monolayers showed a high stability within one hour ( percentage loss of π < 1 . 5 mN / m per hour ) , 115 penetration experiments of the ENTH domain into those monolayers were performed and analyzed . Again , an irregular increase of π after ENTH incubation was observed ( cf . sections 4 . 3 . 1 , 4 . 3 . 2 and 5 . 2 . 1 ) due to inhomoge - neous protein distribution preventing the determination of rate constants . The in - crease of π indicated the penetration of the ENTH helix . 181 At high area per molecule values , the lipid packing density is low whereby insertion or surface activity of the protein can be measured , resulting in an inverse proportionality of Δ π to π 0 . This be - havior was also detected for the ENTH penetration experiment into PS - containing monolayers . The ENTH domain showed low penetration abilities into monolayers of POPC / POPE ( 80 : 20 ) with π c = 23 mN / m and POPC / POPE / POPS ( 60 : 20 : 20 ) with π c = 25 mN / m due to the lack of PIP 2 . Addition of PS slightly increased the penetration capability , especially at low area values . Consequently the negative charge of PS influ - ences the penetration ability of ENTH in absence of PIP 2 , even though the insertion into cell membranes seems unlikely ( π c < 30 mN / m ) . 113 , 114 , 186 Compared to the POPC / POPE monolayers the POPC / POPE / POPS monolayers had a looser lipid pack - ing ( Figure 4 . 28 ) which would explain the slightly higher surface activity of the ENTH . RIfS experiments ( Figure 4 . 13 ) showed that the negative charge of PS is not sufficient for ENTH - binding as the interaction is specific . 24 , 164 Hence , the low penetration ability is reasonable . The experiments with POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 ( 55 : 20 : 20 : 5 ) monolayers revealed slightly higher π c values with 32 mN / m compared to POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 75 : 20 : 5 ) monolayers with π c = 30 mN / m . Within the error margin , the differences are negligi - ble indicating that the penetration ability of ENTH into POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 mon - olayers is not significantly different compared to POPC / POPE / PIP 2 bilayers . In Figure 5 . 10 , π c is plotted against the area per molecule at π = 20 mN / m , showing that the lipid packing did not affected the ENTH helix penetration significantly . For a better overview , only values for 0 and 5 mol % PIP 2 with and without PS were considered . The surface pressure of 20 mN / m was chosen to ensure that the monolayers did not collapse . 5 Discussion 123 Figure 5 . 10 : Illustration of π c against the lipid packing at π = 20 mN / m for the lipid compositions POPC / POPE / PIP 2 ( 80 - x : 20 : x , with x = 0 or 5 mol % ) and POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 ( 60 - x : 20 : 20 : x , with x = 0 or 5 mol % ) indicating that PS only slightly affects the penetration capability of ENTH although the lipid packing is decreased . Subphase : HEPES buffer . The area per molecule increased about 15 - 20 Å 2 when PS was present . Due to repul - sive interactions , the area per molecule incremented resulting in a larger area for the lipids . In different studies using vesicles , it was shown that the outer leaflet of the vesicles has a looser lipid packing at higher membrane curvatures . 196 – 198 Moreover , the re - cruitment of hydrophobic helices to curved structures is preferred , 153 , 199 thus pene - tration into a monolayer with a looser lipid packing was expected . Although the pen - etration is preferred when the lipid packing is low , the results show that the penetra - tion is mainly a function of the PIP 2 concentration at a pH of 7 . 4 . Hom et al . revealed that the penetration capability of ENTH increased with decreased pH due to proto - nated histidine residues interacting with the monolayer . 8 Therefore , changing the pH value might also increase penetration in case of PS . Furthermore the preferred helix insertion into membranes with looser lipid packing may facilitate penetration in curved structures , but not in flat Langmuir - Blodgett monolayers . In contrast to this , binding studies by means of RIfS , PIP 2 and PS containing bilayers showed a higher protein occupancy than the bilayers without PS ( Figure 4 . 15 ) . This indicates that ENTH adsorption to PIP 2 doped membranes is facilitated , however the penetration ability is not affected . Hence , formation of clusters induced by PS could 5 Discussion 124 be a result of protein - protein interactions , where only a few ENTH monomers pene - trate the monolayer ( or the outer monolayer in supported bilayers ) and the other monomers are interacting with the bound ENTH monomer without penetrating the membrane ( Figure 5 . 11 A ) . As this cluster formation is not observed in the absence of PS ( Figure 4 . 17 ) , binding to PS could establish new binding sites for protein - protein interactions . Yoon et al . assumed an orientation of two ENTH helices in an antiparallel manner and additionally interactions of the amino acids K23 und E42 in the presence of PS . 28 Thus two binding structures of ENTH are conceivable . In Figure 5 . 11 the different feasible membrane - protein and protein - protein interactions in the presence of PS are illus - trated . Figure 5 . 11 : Schematic illustration of predicted ENTH - ENTH interactions resulting in protein clusters . Since penetration of ENTH into the monolayers in the presence of PS is not significantly increased alt - hough cluster formation was observed by means of AFM , interaction of the ENTH with PS could result in new interaction sites within the ENTH monomers for protein - protein interactions ( A ) . In cases of ( I ) and ( III ) the result would be a higher protein occupancy on the surface . Case ( II ) seems less likely as the protein height observed via AFM showed lower monomer heights . ( B ) Furthermore , interactions of the helices in an antiparallel manner still can occur , when only one helix inserts into the monolayer . This would indicate a higher occupancy , but no further penetration . The results so far show that the lipids PIP 2 and PS have an impact on the ENTH - membrane interaction . Increase of PIP 2 and addition of PS increased the amount of bound ENTH on bi - and monolayers . PIP 2 specifically binds the ENTH and induces the formation of a new α 0 helix which can insert into the membrane . PS additionally in - duced the formation of protein clusters . This in turn shows that the lipid composition 5 Discussion 125 contributes to the regulation of protein - dependent membrane deformation during CME . 5 . 3 Adhered GUV as a membrane model to investigate protein - membrane interactions Adhesion of membranes and regulation of the membrane tension are substantial fac - tors in biological processes , e . g . in exo - and endocytosis . 200 , 201 In the previous chap - ters the impact of PIP 2 and PS on the binding structure of ENTH in protein - membrane and protein - protein interactions was discussed in detail . In order to investigate if the ENTH can moreover affect the mechanical properties of membranes dependent on the lipid composition , adhered GUVs were utilized as membrane models . The interactions of ENTH with PIP 2 as a function of lateral membrane tension were already analyzed previously , 79 thus in the next chapter the influence of ENTH on the membrane tension in the presence of PS was investigated . 5 . 3 . 1 Adhesion of biotinylated GUVs on PEG - functionalized surfaces The formation of adhered GUVs requires a suitable surface to generate a contact area between the GUV and the substrate . Immobilization of GUVs via biotin - avidin inter - actions was already realized previously . Gleisner et al . incubated avidin on hydrophi - lized glass substrates . 36 Addition of biotinylated GUVs composed of either DOPC / DOPE / cap - biotin - DOPE / PIP 2 / Atto488 - DPPE ( 66 : 30 : 2 : 1 : 1 ) or DOPC / DOPE / cap - biotin - DOPE / Atto488 - DPPE ( 67 : 30 : 2 : 1 ) resulted in immobile vesicles with a contact area to the surface . The lateral membrane tensions of these adhered GUVs ranged from 0 . 01 to 1 . 02 mN / m . 36 Regulation of the membrane tension was realized by varying the concentration of MgCl 2 in the surrounding buffer and was attributed to stronger interactions of PIP 2 and the Mg 2 + ions . Thereby , smaller membrane ten - sions were determined for GUVs lacking PIP 2 compared to GUVs with PIP 2 . 5 Discussion 126 In this thesis , the impact of PS on the membrane tension of GUVs was investigated using similar conditions as Gleisner et al . 36 Since negative charges of PS and PIP 2 are known to cluster in the presence of MgCl 2 , regulation of the membrane tension with the MgCl 2 concentration was excluded . 125 , 126 Moreover , it was shown that Neu - trAvidin exhibits less non - specific interactions than avidin in immunoassays while maintaining a high binding affinity to biotin ( ~ 1 . 3∙10 - 9 µM ) . 127 , 202 Thus , it is assumed to be promising for biosensing applications . To reduce unspecific interactions of the negative charges of PS / PIP 2 and avidin to a minimum , avidin was replaced by the de - glycosylated protein NeutrAvidin . However , incubation of NeutrAvidin on hydrophilized glass substrates resulted in an inhomogenous distribution of the protein on the surface ( Figure 4 . 31 ) and immobili - zation of the vesicles via NeutrAvidin - biotin binding was not possible as the protein was removed from the surface during rinsing . Avidin has its isoelectric point at pH 10 . 5 and it is positively charged at a pH of 7 . 4 . 203 This promotes the electrostatic in - teractions of avidin with the surface . Compared to that , NeutrAvidin exhibits an isoeletric point of 6 . 3 , which leads to less non - specific interaction with the substrate surface , while the high binding affinity to biotin is still existing 60 , 127 and would explain the inhomogenous coverage of NeutrAvidin on the hydrophilized glass surface . On this account , the strategy for NeutrAvidin immobilization had to be changed . A method to immobilize vesicles bases on the work of Piehler et al . was used . 129 Silani - zation of glass substrates with ( 3 - Glycidyloxypropyl ) trimethoxysilane ( GOPTS ) re - sulted in a surface with epoxide moieties . Depending on the added reagent , the func - tionalization on the substrate surface was regulated ( Figure 3 . 3 ) . J . Thiart and Schwamborn et al . utilized this technique and coupled amino - terminated Poly ( eth - ylen glycol ) ( PEG ) groups to the surface . 128 , 204 This solvent - free coupling with amino groups of bifunctional PEGs enabled immobilization of vesicles on these surfaces . Us - ing biotin - PEG - NH 2 ( b - PEG ) ensured the affinity for NeutrAvidin and methoxy - PEG - NH 2 ( m - PEG ) was used to obtain a lateral distance between the biotin groups to be accessible for binding ( Figure 5 . 12 ) . 5 Discussion 127 Figure 5 . 12 : PEG - based surface functionalization . After silanization and PEGylation of glass substrates , the biotin - PEG ( b - PEG ) / methoxy - PEG ( m - PEG ) covered surface was incubated with NeutrAvidin , ena - bling the immobilization of biotinylated GUVs on these surfaces . In contrast to the studies of J . Thiart and Schwamborn et al . , b - PEG and m - PEG species with less PEG groups were used ( M ( m - PEG ) = 350 g / mol and M ( b - PEG ) = 600 g / mol instead of M ( m - PEG ) = 2000 g / mol and M ( b - PEG ) = 3000 g / mol ) . PEG is known to re - duce the adhesion of proteins or other molecules and is used to protect surfaces . 205 , 206 Thereby , the PEG density on the surface and the chain length can influence the ad - sorption of molecules . 207 Since an ordered structure of PEGs on the surface cannot be guaranteed , biotin molecules could be less accessible . Therefore , the amount of PEG groups was reduced to diminish the repelling character of the PEG surface . Incubation of these m - PEG / b - PEG surfaces with labeled NeutrAvidin yielded an even distribution in the fluorescence intensity of the labeled protein on the surface ( Figure 4 . 31 ) indicating a homogenous coverage of NeutrAvidin on the substrates . As the b - PEGs were covalently bound to the silane on the glass surface , the NeutrAvidin also was immobilized due to the high affinity to biotin and was not removed by rinsing with buffer . Since a homogenous NeutrAvidin occupancy on the PEG surfaces was realized , the system was assumed to be suitable to immobilize biotinylated GUVs via further Neu - trAvidin - biotin interactions . Therefore , GUVs composed of DOPC / DOPS / Cholesterol / cap - biotin - DOPE / PIP 2 / Atto488 - DPPE ( 76 : 10 : 10 : 2 : 1 : 1 ) were added to the system re - sulting in adhered GUVs on the b - PEG - NeutrAvidin surface ( Figure 5 . 13 ) . 5 Discussion 128 Figure 5 . 13 : Schematic illustration of the PEG - based surface functionalization . After silanization and PEGylation of glass substrates , the biotin - PEG ( b - PEG ) / methoxy - PEG ( m - PEG ) covered surface was in - cubated with NeutrAvidin enabling the immobilization of biotinylated GUVs on these surfaces . These GUVs were stable over 2 h , which was proved by determination of the r i / r ad values of the adhered GUVs directly after immobilization ( 15 min ) and after 2h ( Figure 4 . 33 ) . The r i / r ad values did not significantly change within the deviation ( from 0 . 16 ± 0 . 04 to 0 . 17 ± 0 . 04 ) indicating that the GUVs were stable over time . Most likely the stability was maintained due to iso - osmolar conditions using a humidity chamber . The membrane tensions of these GUVs were measured to be ( 1 . 03 ± 0 . 04 ) ∙10 - 2 mN / m ( after 15 min ) and ( 1 . 03 ± 0 . 03 ) ∙10 - 2 mN / m ( after 2 h ) . The values in this thesis are comparable to cellular tensions which are in the range of 0 . 002 - 0 . 3 mN / m depending on the cell type . 201 , 208 – 210 Compared to the membrane tensions of GUVs adhered to avidin coated glass surfaces measured by Gleisner et al . , the values of this work lay in the low membrane tension range . To mimic membrane tensions of different cell types , the lateral membrane tension of the adhered GUVs should be regulated . Due to this , the amount of biotin on the surface was varied by changing the ratio of m - PEG and b - PEG to see if the amount of accessi - ble biotin molecules could be increased . NeutrAvidin has 4 binding sites for biotin , 2 on each side ( cf . Figure 5 . 13 ) , 58 thus a higher concentration of biotin on the surface could increase the coverage of NeutrAvidin on the surface . However the membrane tension of the GUVs was not affected by variations in the m - PEG / b - PEG ratio ( Figure 5 Discussion 129 4 . 34 ) . Since NeutrAvidin has a high binding affinity to biotin , the surface could be completely covered at a ratio of 1 : 1 . 127 , 202 Thus further raise of the b - PEG concentra - tion would not affect the protein occupancy and the adhesion of biotynilated GUVs . Another possibility to regulate the membrane tension could be achieved by changing the lipid composition . Nevertheless , it was not tried to vary the membrane tension as a function of the lipid composition because the search for an adequate lipid composi - tion , resulting in stable GUVs , was challenging . However , the increase of biotin - cou - pled lipids may facilitate binding to the NeutrAvidin surfaces and consequently in - crease the membrane tension . Moreover , the variation of the negative charges ( PIP 2 and PS ) in the lipids could have an impact on the membrane tensions . Raucher et al . already showed with experi - ments on NIH - 3T3 cells that PIP 2 can control the adhesion . 211 Raise of the PS concen - trations in combination with this surface functionalization though , was not possible as these vesicles were unstable or too small to determine the membrane tension based on the geometry . Although GUVs with higher proportions of negative charges ( ~ 25 % ) were already generated , 212 , 213 incorporation of negative charges is limited due to repulsive interactions and cluster formations . 214 , 215 As higher PS concentra - tions were already realized in free vesicles , it is more likely that the PEG functionali - zation and the adhesion ( higher membrane tensions ) also had an impact on the GUV stability when a higher PS content was incorporated in the vesicles . Thus , before the lipid composition was further adjusted , the impact of ENTH on the membrane tension of GUVs composed of DOPC / DOPS / Cholesterol / cap - biotin - DOPE / PIP 2 / Atto488 - DPPE ( 76 : 10 : 10 : 2 : 1 : 1 ) was investigated in detail . 5 . 3 . 2 Effect of the ENTH binding to PS - containing adhered GUVs Once stable adhered GUVs were generated and the membrane tension was deter - mined , the ENTH binding activity on these membranes was analyzed . After incubation of GUVs composed of DOPC / DOPS / Cholesterol / cap - biotin - DOPE / PIP 2 / Atto488 - DPPE ( 76 : 10 : 10 : 2 : 1 : 1 ) with 1 µM ENTH for 2h , the solution contained less GUVs and 5 Discussion 130 a lot of lipid material outside the vesicles was observed . The amount of vesicles before and after ENTH addition was not counted , but the difference was obvious . During im - aging of the remaining GUVs , the vesicles ruptured . This only happened when ENTH was present ( Figure 4 . 37 ) . In the absence of ENTH , no rupturing event occurred within 2 h ( Figure 4 . 33 ) indicating that the rupture of the vesicles is affected by the protein adsorption to the PIP 2 doped GUVs . Reduction of the ENTH ( 0 . 3 µM ) concen - tration still resulted in GUV rupturing ( Figure 4 . 38 ) showing that even significantly lower concentrations are sufficient to induce GUV bursting . In clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , binding of the ENTH domain to PIP 2 results in the formation of a new amphipathic helix which inserts into the inner leaflet of the membrane . 21 The insertion of the helix disturbs the membrane and consequently can influence the lipid packing in the membrane . 7 In this work an analogous behavior for the adhered GUVs might cause an insertion into the outer leaflet . Therefore , different reasons for the presence of less GUVs and the vesicle rupture are conceivable . First of all , the helix insertion can cause membrane defects due to the disturbance of the lipid packing . 216 , 217 This could destabilize the vesicles , leading to the breakdown of the osmolarity gradient and consequently rupture of the vesicles . Different studies revealed that insertion of an amphipathic helix is preferred to small hydrophobic lipid bilayer packing defects . 218 – 220 This is also consistent with the fact that ENTH favors binding to curved membranes as they exhibit more packing de - fects . 221 Preferred insertion of the ENTH helix into those membranes can facilitate membrane deformation or induction of membrane defects . Although the bilayer structure of GUVs seem to be flat in the lipid scale , they exhibit a higher curvature compared to flat Langmuir - Blodgett monolayers . Thus , a slightly higher insertion rate of the ENTH helix can be assumed . In the adhered GUVs the PS could additionally in - crease the insertion of the ENTH helix , even though it was not shown in Langmuir - Blodgett monolayers . Furthermore , the helix insertion reduces the bending rigidity of the membrane . A re - duced bending stiffness lowers the energy which is required for membrane defor - mation . 79 Due to this , the formation of tubules or even vesicles out of the GUV is facil - itated ( Figure 5 . 14 ) which leads to the destabilization of the vesicles . 5 Discussion 131 Figure 5 . 14 : Binding of ENTH ( green ) to adhered GUVs resulting in the formation of tubules , which furthermore destabilizes the adhered GUV . During the formation of these structures the size of the vesicle decreases until all lipid material is dissipated . This would explain why usually less GUVs were found in the solution after ENTH addition . Tubulation of vesicles due to ENTH adsorption was al - ready reported in the literature . Yoon et al . showed that incubation of free vesicles composed of POPC / POPE / POPS / PIP 2 / Rh - PE ( 46 . 5 : 30 : 20 : 3 : 0 . 5 ) with 0 . 5 µM ENTH resulted in the appearance of tubular structures . 28 Gleisner et al . showed with studies on adhered GUVs that at low membrane tensions ( 0 . 08 mN / m ) tubular structures were observed after the ENTH addition ( 1 µM ) . In contrast to that adhered GUVs flat - tened at high membrane tensions when ENTH was present . The adhered GUVs in this thesis exhibited even lower membrane tensions ( 0 . 01 mN / m ) , indicating that tubula - tion seems likely . However , some studies revealed that tubulation only occurs , when the protein cover - age of the surface is above 20 % . 30 At high ENTH concentrations and 1 mol % PIP 2 con - centration , a protein coverage of maximum 23 % should be reached considering the footprint of ENTH ( 16 nm 2 ) 22 and the surface demand of the receptor lipid ( 0 . 7 nm 2 ) . 44 At a concentration of 1 µM this decreases to 16 % when the K D of 0 . 42 µM is noted , which should not induce tubulations . Nevertheless , tubulation was already observed at lower protein coverage ( 11 . 4 % ) even in the absence of PS 79 Addition of PS might facilitate the tubulation . It was shown that PS has a significant impact on the binding as a higher binding affinity and a higher protein occupancy on the bilayer surface were measured in the presence of PS ( cf . chapter 4 . 2 . 2 ) . This was 5 Discussion 132 attributed to the cluster formation induced by PS . Protein crowding was shown to destabilize membrane shapes . 35 Cluster formation and the insertion of the ENTH helix in one region of the GUVs would lead to instabilities , hence the rupturing seems rea - sonable . Furthermore , heterogeneities of the lipid distribution within the GUVs could lead to a higher amount of PIP 2 and PS in some vesicles . Different studies revealed that the heterogeneities of the lipid compositions in one GUV preparation via electrofor - mation can vary from 2 to 13 % . 222 , 223 If more PIP 2 and PS are present in some GUVs compared to others ( excluding PIP 2 clustering ) , this would lead to a higher amount of bound ENTH and would explain the reduced amount of GUVs as they burst earlier due to defects caused by the helix insertion of ENTH . Krishnan et al . showed that the interactions of PIP 2 with the actin - binding protein profilin led to the destabilization of GUVs . 224 From 8 - 10 mol % PIP 2 they recognized the start of PIP 2 cluster formation . Further increase of the concentration destabilized the GUVs due to the local membrane deformation by the clusters . If some vesicles ex - hibit high local accumulations of PIP 2 , it can lead to destabilization . Considering that some GUVs were imaged in the first seconds and only ruptured dur - ing the time - series , perhaps also the laser irradiation had an influence on the GUV stability . Brückner et al . induced changes in the GUV shape with UV light . 225 Other experiments varied the area / volume ratio by temperature dependent vesicle shape changes . 226 Although the energy of UV ( 10 - 400 nm ) and visible light ( here ~ 600 nm ) differ and the temperature changes by the laser should be negligible , an impact of the laser illumination cannot be excluded as GUVs rupture during imaging . As the amount of GUVs during incubation with ENTH seemed to decrease , a combina - tion of different effects is assumed as its cause . First of all , the helix insertion disturbs the bilayer and leads to lipid packing defects which destabilize the GUV . Secondly , the presence of PS induces protein crowding , facilitating membrane deformation and in - creasing membrane defects . Finally , the laser illumination leads to the rupture of the remaining destabilized vesicles . In conclusion , it was shown successfully that the analysis of adhered GUVs on b - PEG - NeutrAvidin functionalized surfaces is possible . However , the system is only suitable to a limited extent to investigate the impact of ENTH on the mechanical properties of 5 Discussion 133 these adhered GUVs in the presence of PS . Reducing the PS concentration or / and re - pelling character of the PEG surface ( e . g . further decrease of the amount of PEG groups ) might improve the system . 6 Conclusion 135 6 C ONCLUSION Membrane remodeling processes which occur during endocytosis , are regulated by the complex interactions between proteins and lipid membranes . The most important pathway for endocytosis is the clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , where adaptor proteins like epsin induce a membrane invagination by specific binding to the recep - tor lipid phosphatidylinositol - ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) . In this thesis the lipid de - pendent binding of the epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain to artificial mem - brane models was analyzed . The binding studies of ENTH to supported lipid bilayer and monolayers doped with PIP 2 revealed an asymmetric distribution of the specific receptor lipid within both leaflets of a bilayer . Increasing the PIP 2 concentration resulted in an increased optical thickness and consequently a higher occupancy on the membrane surface . Only in case of monolayers nearly a complete coverage was achieved with an optical thick - ness of 2 . 2 ± 0 . 4 nm . Addition of lipids with the negatively charged head group phosphatidylserine ( PS ) increased the binding affinity of ENTH to PIP 2 containing membranes . Since the ENTH did not bind to POPC / POPS bilayers in the absence of PIP 2 , the specific binding to PIP 2 and not to the negative charge by non - specific electrostatic interactions was proved . The dissociation constant of ENTH binding to a POPC / POPS / PIP 2 bilayer was about twice as high as to a POPC / PIP 2 bilayer . Moreover , the maximum in optical thickness upon protein binding increased from 1 . 6 ± 0 . 1 nm ( without PS ) to 2 . 5 ± 0 . 1 nm ( with PS ) at the same PIP 2 concentration , showing a relevant effect of PS on the binding behavior of ENTH to those membranes . Analysis of the surface topography before and after ENTH adsorption indicated that this increased occupancy resulted from cluster formation of ENTH monomers when PS was present . In the absence of PS no clusters or single molecules were detected on the bilayer surface due to the high mobility of the single ENTH monomers . Monolayer penetration experiments were performed to investigate the penetration ability of ENTH into monolayers as a function of the surface pressure dependending on the lipid composition . The critical surface pressure is the maximum value , where 6 Conclusion 136 no insertion of proteins into the monolayer is possible anymore . Increasing the PIP 2 content first increased the penetration capability and reached a maximum at 5 mol % PIP 2 with π c = 30 . 3 ±0 . 4 mN / m . The lipid packing was then changed by the addition of PS , only slightly increasing the critical surface pressure to π c = 32 . 0 ± 0 . 9 mN / m , although a higher binding affinity and protein coverage on PIP 2 / PS doped membranes was observed . This indicates that PS is inducing protein clusters , which only partly penetrate the membrane . Adhered GUVs as membrane models enabled to measure ENTH activity as a function of membrane tension . The membrane tension of GUVs adhered to NeutrAvidin func - tionalized substrates was determined to be 0 . 01 mN / m . After incubation with ENTH , these GUVs ruptured induced by the insertion of the ENTH helix and consequently appearance of lipid packing defects in the membrane . In conclusion , it was shown that ENTH binding to membranes is highly regulated by the lipid composition . Furthermore , the results revealed that the membrane defor - mation in CME induced by ENTH is an interplay of the ENTH helix insertion and the crowding mechanism induced by PIP 2 and PS . 7 Bibliography 137 7 B IBLIOGRAPHY 1 .

Die vielen hilfreichen Diskussionen haben mich immer wieder mo - tiviert und vorangebracht . Danke auch an Prof . Dr . Burg für die Übernahmen des Korreferats . Zudem bedanke ich mich für die konstruktiven Ratschläge in den Thesis Committees . Bei Prof . Dr . Michael Meinecke möchte ich mich für die gute Kooperation , die Teil - nahme an meinem Thesis Committee und die daraus resultierenden wertvollen Ideen und Diskussionen bedanken . Ein ganz besonderer Dank geht an Ingo , der mir in vielen wissenschaftlichen Fragen und sonstigen Problemen geholfen hat . Manchmal kannst du ja doch nett sein . Dank dir weiß ich nun auch wie einfach das Zubereiten von Pulled Pork ist . . . , aber immerhin sind wir jetzt quitt ! Ebenfalls danke ich Tabea für die Unterstützung bei Problemen und Fragen während der Doktorarbeit . Vielen , vielen Dank auch an Melanie , Marianne und Dana für ihre Hilfe in allen orga - nisatorischen Fragen und für all die lustigen Gespräche im Sekretariat . Danke für eure Geduld bei allen Formularen , Raumbuchungen oder sonstigen Terminplanungen . Das hat das Arbeiten deutlich erleichtert . Jutta und Micha möchte ich für die Unterstützung bei allen Laborarbeiten danken . Danke insbesondere für die teilweise sehr spontanen Experimentvorbereitungen . Ihr habt das Arbeiten schnell und angenehm gemacht . Zudem danke ich Micha und Hans - Peter für die tolle Unterstützung im Mediziner - Praktikum . Dr . Benjamin Kroppen und Indrani Mukherjee danke ich für die gute Kooperation und die Proteinisolation . Danke auch an meine Leidensgenossen Johannes und Jerry im Schreibraum . Auch wenn ich eure MatLab Gespräche nicht unbedingt vermissen werde , war es sehr lustig mit euch . Vor allem danke ich Jerry dafür , dass er mich nicht wegen meiner tausend Fragen , Diskussionen oder Beschwerden aus dem Fenster geworfen hat . Verdient hätte ich es und dass du das hingekriegt hättest , ist auch kein Geheimnis . 190 Bei meinen Bachelorstudenten Elisa , Stephan und Patrick möchte ich mich für ihren Beitrag zu dieser Arbeiten bedanken . Eure Beiträge haben meine Arbeit erheblich vo - rangebracht . Weiterhin möchte ich mich bei dem hervorragenden asiatischen Lieferservice von Buddy während der Schreibphase bedanken . Es ist super , wenn man sich um eine Sa - che weniger sorgen muss . Auch danke ich Nils ( und Kri ) für die diversen Mahlzeiten . Ich stehe immer gerne für eine Kaiserschmarrn - Verkostung ( oder ein Sch ( l ) äfchen ) zur Verfügung . Und natürlich darf ich Niko nicht vergessen . Danke für das tägliche „Gießen“ . Ohne dich wäre ich bestimm schon längst „verwelkt“ . Ich danke allen Korrekturlesern , insbesondere Jerry , Peter und Jonas , die noch einige interessante Ideen und Aspekte zu dieser Arbeit beigesteuert haben . Dem ganzen AK möchte ich für alle sinnvollen und weniger sinnvollen Gespräche während und nach der Arbeitszeit bedanken . Ich werde unsere Grill - , Karaoke - oder sonstigen Abende sehr vermissen ! UND das hab ich ( gar nicht ) so gemeint ! ! ! Ein weiterer Dank gilt meinen Kommilitonen und Freunden , die das Studentenleben unvergesslich gemacht haben . Ein großer Dank geht vor allem an meine Mädels . Auch wenn wir mittlerweile etwas verstreut leben , die Tages - und Abendausflüge bleiben die besten Ablenkungen von einem anstrengenden Tag . Ihr seid die Besten ! Zum Schluss bedanke ich mich von ganzem Herzen bei meiner Familie . Danke , dass ihr mir das alles ermöglicht und mich immer unterstützt habt . Das hier ist auch euer Verdienst . Danke für alles !
