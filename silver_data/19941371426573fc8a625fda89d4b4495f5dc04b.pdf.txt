Michael Roberts 1 , 2 and Toshihiko Ezashi 1 , 2 Abstract Understanding essential signaling network requirements and making appropriate adjustments in culture conditions are crucial if porcine pluripotent stem cells ( PSC ) are to achieve their full potential . Here , we ﬁ rst used two protein factors ( LIF and FGF2 ) and kinase inhibitor combinations in attempts to convert primed type lentiviral - reprogrammed porcine induced PSC ( Lv - piPSC ) into naïve - like state and developed a medium called FL6i . In addition to FGF2 and LIF , this medium contained inhibitors of MAPK14 , MAPK8 , TGFB1 , MAP2K1 , GSK3A and BMP . Crucially , the usual TGFB1 and BMP4 protein components of many stem cell media were replaced in FL6i with inhibitors of TGFB1 and BMP . With this medium , Lv - piPSC were readily transformed from their original primed state into cells that formed colonies with typical features of naïve - state stem cells . The FL6i medium also assisted generation of naïve - type piPSC lines from porcine embryonic ﬁ broblasts with non - integrating episomal plasmids ( Epi - piPSC ) . These lines , despite retaining variable amounts of vector DNA , expressed higher endogenous pPOU5F1 and pSOX2 than Lv - piPSC . They have been cultured without obvious morphological change for > 45 passages and retained pluripotent phenotypes in terms of upregulation of genes associated with pluripotency , low expression of genes linked to emergence of somatic cell lineages , and ability to generate well differentiated teratomas in immune - compromised mice . FL6i conditions , therefore , appear to support elevated pluripotent phenotypes . However , FL6i was less able to support the generation of embryonic stem cells from porcine blastocysts . Although colonies with dome - shaped morphologies were evident and the cells had some gene expression features linked to pluripotency , the phenotypes were ultimately not stable . Pathway analysis derived from RNAseq data performed on the various cell lines generated in this study suggest the bene ﬁ ts of employing the FL6i medium on porcine cells reside in its ability to minimize TGFB1 and BMP signaling , which would otherwise de - stabilize the stem cell state . Introduction Pigs probably constitute the premier non - primate model for biomedical testing because of their physiolo - gical similarities to humans 1 . Accordingly , porcine plur - ipotent stem cells ( PSC ) potentially provide powerful tools for evaluating the safety and ef ﬁ cacy of stem cell based therapies , as well as having utility in the production of transgenic pigs and xenografts 1 , 2 . However , the derivation of authentic porcine embryonic stem cell ( pESC ) 3 – 8 and transgene free porcine iPSC ( piPSC ) 9 – 12 that can readily differentiate into all cell lineages still remains proble - matic 13 , although several promising advances have recently been reported 10 , 14 – 16 . Most , if not all , piPSC lines depend on ectopic genes expressions to maintain self - renewal because of a failure to fully activate the endogenous genes required to provide © The Author ( s ) 2019 OpenAccess ThisarticleislicensedunderaCreativeCommonsAttribution4 . 0InternationalLicense , whichpermitsuse , sharing , adaptation , distributionandreproduction inanymediumorformat , aslongasyougiveappropriatecredittotheoriginalauthor ( s ) andthesource , providealinktotheCreativeCommonslicense , andindicateif changesweremade .

The persistent expression of these reprogramming genes may complicate cell dif - ferentiation protocols , and there is concern that they may produce tumors in the treated animal . Various non - viral reprogramming methods have been tested to obtain transgene - free piPSC , but outcomes fail to up - regulate endogenous genes and whether or not the persistence of ectopic gene expression is required for pluripotency have been ambiguous 18 , 20 – 22 . There have also been consistent failures in generating pESC from the inner cell mass ( ICM ) and epiblast of porcine embryos , suggesting that special culture conditions are necessary to maintain stable endogenous pluripotency networks in pig cells . It has long been known that supplementation with certain cytokines and small molecule inhibitors and other ﬁ ne tuning of the culture conditions can allow derivation of PSC from certain “ non - permissive ” mouse strains and rats 23 – 25 and { Buehr , 2008 # 141 } permit generation of human PSC in various states of pluripotency 26 – 32 . Here we report the development of culture conditions , based on the naïve human stem cell medium ( NHSM ) 27 , that permits conversion of primed / epiblast - types of piPSC into cultures with naïve - type properties . Two other goals were to employ similar culture conditions to produce piPSC from somatic cells by using non - integrating epi - somal plasmids and to generate genuine pESC from outgrowths of porcine blastocysts . Materials and methods Routine maintenance and culture conditions of PSC For routine maintenance , piPSC and pESC like cells ( pESCLC ) were cultured on irradiated mouse embryonic ﬁ broblasts ( iMEF ) in 10 cm - culture dish ( Corning ) , six - well tissue culture plates ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c ) or twelve - well culture plates ( Thermo ) under 5 % CO 2 , 5 % O 2 , and 20 % N 2 atmosphere in O 2 / CO 2 incubator ( Heracell150 , Thermo ) with daily medium exchange . We employed an antibiotic - free culture condition , which provides an on - going means of monitoring aseptic technique by labora - tory workers . Mycoplasma infections are regularly sur - veyed ( every quarter ) by MycoAlert ™ Mycoplasma Detection Kit ( Lonza ) . The cells used in the study were all infection free . The medium included : [ 1 .

Cytokine and small molecules include 20 ng / ml hLIF ( Millipore ) , 8 ng / ml hFGF2 , 2 ng / ml TGFB1 ( Prospec ) , 2 µM p38i ( MAPK14 inhibitor , BIRB796 , Selleckchem ) , 5 μ M JNKi ( MAPK8 inhibitor , SP600125 , Tocris ) , 0 . 4 μ M BMP inhibitor ( LDN193189 , Axon ) , 3 μ M GSK3A inhibitor ( CHIR99021 , STEMCELL Technologies ) , and 1 μ M ERK1 / 2i ( MAP2K inhibitor , PD0325901 , Selleckchem ) 27 .

FL6i ] modi ﬁ ed from NHSM by replacing TGFB1 with 1 μ M TGFB1 inhibitor . Additionally , FGFR inhibitor PD173074 ( STEMCELL Technologies ) and JAK Inhibitor I ( CAS 457081 - 03 - 7 , Calbiochem ) were tested in Lv - piPSC cul - ture ( Fig . 2b ) . Generation of iPSCs from porcine fetal ﬁ broblasts with episomal vectors Porcine fetal ﬁ broblasts were reprogrammed with non - integrating episomal vectors according to previously described protocols 35 . 3 μ g of combined three episomal plasmids ( Addgene # 27077 , 27078 and 27079 ) containing human POU5F1 , SOX2 , KLF4 , LIN28 , L - MYC and p53 shRNA were electroporated with a Nucleofector II device ( Lonza ) and Amaxa NHDF Nucleofector kit ( Lonza ) into 6 × 10 5 porcine fetal ﬁ broblast cells derived from day 34 conceptuses 36 . The following day , the cells were placed into three 10 cm dishes previously plated with iMEF . Next day the culture medium was switched to NHSM basal medium with FGF2 and LIF ( FL condition in the ﬁ rst dish ) , FLB2i medium in the second dish and FL6i medium in the third dish . 17 - day post transfection , emerged independent colonies were mechanically isolated from the dishes and expanded . A total of two iPSC lines in FL , four lines in FLB2i and eight lines in FL6i conditions were established , respectively . Collection , production , and culture of porcine blastocysts The collection , production and culture of porcine blastocysts was conducted by using methods described previously 37 . Porcine blastocysts were seeded on iMEFs and in pESC medium 7 , a 50 : 50 mixture of DMEM low glucose and Ham ’ s F10 medium ( Thermo ) , supplemented with 15 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Hyclone ) , 2 mM glu - tamax , 0 . 1 mM ß - mercaptoethanol , 1x MEM nonessential amino acids , 1x antibiotic / antimycotic ( Thermo ) con - taining cytokines , and 20 ng / ml hFGF2 ( in house ) 33 . Two methods were used to generate pESCLC : plating day 7 – 8 of intact blastocyst and inner cell mass ( ICM ) isolated by immunosurgery 38 . Following 5 – 7 days of culture , we observed pESCLC primary colonies derived from porcine blastocysts . These pESCLC colonies were mechanically dissociated into several clumps by using pulled glass pipettes 10 – 15 days after seeding . Dissociated clumps were then re - seeded on fresh iMEFs , and subsequent pESCLC lines were routinely passaged via the pulled glass pipette method every 5 – 7 days . Yuan et al . Cell Death Discovery ( 2019 ) 5 : 104 Page 2 of 14 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association Alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) staining and immunocytochemistry ( ICC ) AP staining was performed by the nitro blue tetrazolium / 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl phosphate method ( Promega ) . For ICC , cells were ﬁ xed in 4 % w / v paraformaldehyde / PBS for 12 min , washed with PBS twice , and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) for 20 min After washing with PBS , the cells were incubated with 5 % v / v goat or donkey serum ( Sigma ) in PBS for 30 min Cells were then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C . After washing , the cells were incubated with secondary antibody . Nuclei were stained with 6 ng / ml 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( Invitrogen ) . For POU5F1 staining on teratoma tissues , maximum - intensity projection of 3D montage images were obtained by using a Leica SP8 spectral confocal microscope ( research . missouri . edu / mcc / leica _ tcp _ sp8 _ mp . php ) to cover the large ( mm size ) area . Other Fluorescence images were taken under an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope at the Molecular Cytology Core at University of Missouri . Primary anti - bodies include : POU5F1 ( 1 : 1000 in house 39 or 1 : 100 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , catalog no . sc - 9081 ) , SOX2 ( 1 : 1000 ; R & D Systems , MAB2018 ) , NANOG ( 1 : 200 ; Abcam , ab109250 ) , SSEA1 ( 1 : 50 ; Developmental Studies Hybri - doma Bank [ DSHB ] , MC - 480 ) , SSEA4 ( 1 : 50 ; DSHB , MC - 813 - 70 ) , KRT7 ( 1 : 100 ; DAKO , M701801 - 2 ) , DESMIN ( 1 : 100 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 14026 ) , NESTIN ( 1 : 100 ; Abcam , ab6320 ) , SOX17 ( 1 : 100 ; R & D Systems , AF1924 ) , Embryoid body ( EB ) formation and in vitro differentiation Epi - piPSC lines were manually isolated from the culture dish coated with iMEFs , dissociated with Accutase ( STEMCELL Technologies ) . The dissociated cells were allowed to form EB by the hanging drop method 40 in a droplet medium . The medium was that used for prior culture but lacked supplementary cytokines and inhibi - tors . After ﬁ ve days , the EBs were transferred to adherent , gelatin - coated tissue - culture dishes and allowed to dif - ferentiate further for 2 weeks . Reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) analysis and quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) To analyze the gene expression patterns of undiffer - entiated or differentiated cells , total RNA from individual samples was extracted in STAT - 60 ( Tel - Test Inc ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . cDNA was synthesized by using the SuperScript VILO kit ( Life Technologies ) . PCR was performed with Taq DNA polymerase ( PCR Master Mix , Thermo ) under the fol - lowing conditions : 95 ° C for 15 min followed by 30 ampli ﬁ cation cycles ( 95 °C , 15 s ; annealing temperature of speci ﬁ c primers , 30 s ; 72 °C , 30 s ) with an extension cycle at 72 °C for 1 min Quantitative PCR was performed with SYBR Green PCR kit ( Life Technologies ) on an ABI 7500 Real - Time PCR System ( Applied Biosystem ) . GAPDH was used as a reference gene for this experiment . All the primers used in this experiment were shown in Supple - mentary Table 4 . RNA sequencing analysis Total RNA was extracted from the Lv - piPSC , Epi - piPSCs and pESCLC lines cultured in respective condi - tions by using STAT - 60 . The quantitation and quality control of RNA from all samples was performed on a Fragment Analyzer ( Advanced Analytical ) , and cDNA libraries were constructed by standard methods ( Illumina TruSeq mRNA stranded kit ) with index adapters ( Illu - mina TruSeq indexes ) . The RNA - Seq data were generated on the Illumina ( HiSeq 2500 instrument ) platform by 50 bp paired - end sequencing . The sequencing reads were aligned onto Sscrofa11 . 1 reference genome by TopHat v2 . 1 . 0 software 41 . The mapped reads were transformed into the count matrix with default parameters by HTSeq v0 . 8 . 0 software 42 , followed by normalization with DESeq v2 software 43 . Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) were identi ﬁ ed by means of the same software , DESeq2 , based on negative binomial generalized linear models . GO enrichment analysis of the DEGs was performed by using PANTHER ( www . pantherdb . org / ) 44 . For the visualization of enriched GO terms in ranked lists of DEGs and their clustering , all heatmaps were generated by the Heatmap - per ( www . pantherdb . org / ) 45 with log2 transformed values . Teratoma formation 20 million cells of the Epi - piPSC , Lv - piPSC and Epi - hESC lines obtained by Dispase dispersion of attached colonies ( 1 mg / mL , STEMCELL Technologies ) were cen - trifuged ( 200× g for 5 min ) , resuspended in 0 . 2 mL of ori - ginal culture medium , and chilled on ice before mixing with 0 . 14 ml of Matrigel ( Corning ) supplemented with ROCKi , Y - 27632 ( ﬁ nal 10 µM ) . The solution was loaded into a 1 - mL syringe ( Becton Dickinson ) and injected subcutaneously into 8 to 12 - week - old non - obese diabetic SCID - γ mice ( for all except Lv - piPSC - F , Jackson Labora - tories ) or CD - 1 nude mice ( for Lv - piPSC - F , Charles River ) on their ﬂ anks through 22 - gauge needles ( 10 million cells of the former and 1 million for the latter per site ) . The tumors were dissected out after euthanizing the mice and ﬁ xed in 10 % ( v / v ) neutral buffered formalin overnight . Paraf ﬁ n - embedded tissue was sectioned and then stained with H & E . All animal experiments were approved by the University of Missouri Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under Protocols 7170 and 8053 . Yuan et al . Cell Death Discovery ( 2019 ) 5 : 104 Page 3 of 14 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association Statistical analysis For qPCR results , the mRNA abundance levels of a target gene were normalized to the internal control gene , GAPDH , and the relative expression value were deter - mined by comparative threshold cycle method 46 . Data were analyzed by using the relative expression tool REST 2009 version 2 . 0 . 13 47 . DESeq2 was used to detect sig - ni ﬁ cantly differentially expressed genes in the RNAseq analysis 43 . For cell doubling time , the comparison was performed by permutation tests for the differences between groups of growth curves from the R project for statistical computing 48 . Results Transition of primed type porcine iPSC to naïve - like pluripotency state We examined whether the NHSM 27 could be used for culturing the primed type lentiviral reprogrammed piPSC ( Lv - piPSC ) ID6 line that has been maintained in DMEM / F12 medium supplemented with FGF2 ( termed as F ; Supplementary Table 1b ) 34 . The human ESC ( hESC ) line ( WA01 / H1 ) and Lv - piPSC were adapted to NHSM on a feeder layer of irradiated mouse embryonic ﬁ broblasts ( iMEF ) . After 10 - day of culture , colonies of both H1 and Lv - piPSC in F began to exhibit dome - shaped morpholo - gies that resembled those of mouse naïve type ESC ( Fig . 1a ) . However , unlike the hESC , Lv - piPSC were negative for alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) , indicating a loss of pluripotency ( Fig . 1a ) . Primed type Lv - piPSC were then tested for growth on NHSM with the following mod - i ﬁ cations to identify which component in that medium had caused negative consequences of maintaining AP activity : 1 . NHSM with FGF2 and LIF but without inhi - bitors of MAP2K , MAPK8 , MAPK14 , GSK3A , and TGFB1 ; 2 . NHSM without the two inhibitors of MAP2K and GSK3A ; 3 . NHSM without TGFB1 ; 4 . NHSM without inhibitor of MAPK14 ; 5 . NHSM without inhibitor of MAPK8 ; 6 . NHSM without inhibitor of BMP . ( Supple - mentary Table 1a ) . Surprisingly , after 10 - day culture , only condition 3 ( NHSM without TGFB1 ) provided dome - shaped colonies that were AP - positive ( Fig . 1b ) , suggest - ing the presence of TGFB1 that caused the loss of AP activity in Lv - piPSC . By replacing TGFB1 with its inhi - bitor , the proportion of compact dome - shaped , AP - positive colonies relative to ﬂ attened colonies increased nine - fold ( Ratio in no TGFB1 , 1 . 08 ; ratio with TGFB1 inhibitor , 9 . 92 ) ( Fig . 1c ) . As a result , we developed an optimized medium containing a combination of FGF2 , LIF , inhibitors of TGFB1 , MAP2K1 , MAPK8 , MAPK14 , GSK3A and BMP ( termed FL6i medium ) to convert the primed type Lv - piPSC - F into naïve type cells . To ratify the whether all the components ( FGF2 , LIF , inhibitors of MAPK8 , MAPK14 , and BMP ) were required for main - taining the AP - positive / naïve type colony morphology , each compound was sequentially omitted from the FL6i medium . Only cells on the complete medium were con - verted from the primed to naïve - like state ( Fig . 1d ) . Characterizations of Lv - piPSC in FL6i medium The naïve like Lv - piPSC cultured in FL6i ( Lv - piPSC - FL6i ) not only resembled mouse naïve - type ESC ( Fig . 2a ) , but were dispersed into single cells for passaging and had shortened cell doubling time ( from 17 h in F to 13 . 5 h in FL6i , p = 0 . 017 ) . However unlike mouse ESC , they appeared to rely on both FGF / ACTIVIN / NODAL and LIF / JAK / STAT signaling for cell self - renewal ( Fig . 2b ) . They were positive for the pluripotency markers SSEA1 , NANOG , POU5F1 and SOX2 ( Fig . 2c ) , and the expres - sions of several pluripotency - related endogenous genes ( pNANOG , pPOU5F1 , pSOX2 , pMYC , pDPPA3 ) were signi ﬁ cantly increased ( Fig . 2d ) . Despite this upregulation of endogenous genes , the expression of the ectopic genes ( hPOU5F1 hSOX2 , hKLF4 ) used initially to drive induced pluripotency remained relatively unchanged under the new culture conditions ( Fig . 2d ) . The Lv - piPSC - FL6i formed embryoid bodies and underwent spontaneous differentiation . The differentiated cells were positive for ectoderm and mesoderm markers , but they failed to express endoderm markers ( Fig . 2e ) . Derivation of episomal plasmid - mediated piPSC ( Epi - piPSC ) We next examined whether FL6i condition could be used to generate transgene - free piPSC by using non - integrating episomal plasmids 35 , 49 . Porcine fetal ﬁ broblast cells were transiently transfected with the plasmids 35 and plated onto iMEF feeder layers under three culture conditions : 1 , NHSM basal medium with FGF2 and LIF ( FL ) ; 2 , a pre - viously reported medium claimed to generate an inter - mediate pluripotent state in piPSC 19 ( FLB2i ) ; 3 , the newly developed FL6i described above . Two to three weeks after the transfection , primary colonies with ﬂ at morphologies were observed in FL , mounded colonies in FLB2i , and small dome - shaped colonies in FL6i ( Fig . 3a ) . Individual colonies were manually picked and propagated by passaging under the three respective conditions ( Fig . 3b ) , whereas colonies from FLB2i and FL6i conditions demonstrated homogenous POU5F1 expression and were undifferentiated ( Fig . 3c ) . Colonies in FL condition were comprised largely of epithelial - like cells ( Fig . 3b ) with much reduced POU5F1 expression ( Fig . 3c ) . As culture on FL was extended , the cells stopped growing and no iPSC line was established . However , it was possible to generate multiple piPSC in FLB2i ( Epi - piPSC - FLB2i ) and FL6i conditions ( Epi - piPSC - FL6i ) . All were positive for AP and expressed POU5F1 and SOX2 , but all stained negatively for NANOG ( Fig . 3d ) . While Epi - piPSC - FL6i expressed SSEA1 , the Epi - piPSC - FLB2i cells were SSEA4 positive ( Fig . 3d ) . Yuan et al . Cell Death Discovery ( 2019 ) 5 : 104 Page 4 of 14 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association To examine whether any of the reprogramming genes and the plasmids persisted in the established Epi - iPSC , six lines of Epi - iPSC ( three from FLB2i , three from FL6i ) were randomly selected from each culture condition after 80 days of continuous culture ( 15 – 20 passages ) . Speci ﬁ c PCR primers were designed to provide a comparison between transcript levels from endogenous pluripotency genes and those from the exogenous reprogramming genes . Although each reprogrammed cell line was weakly positive for expression of pPOU5F1 and pSOX2 , values were quite variable . The levels of pNANOG transcripts were higher in FL6i than in FLB2i . As observed with the Lv - line in F , all six cell lines robustly expressed hPOU5F1 and hSOX2 , ( Fig . 4b ) . Detection of hPOU5F1 , hSOX2 , and hLIN28 with the vector backbone DNA ( performed with gene speci ﬁ c primer and the vector - speci ﬁ c primer ) ( Fig . 4c ; plasmid POU5F1 , - SOX2 , - LIN28 ) , suggests that the episomal - plasmids had persisted in the cells , possibly through integration into host DNA . Teratoma formation from Epi - piPSC generated under different culture conditions To evaluate the pluripotency of the newly developed Epi - piPSC and compare their ability in generating differ - entiated cell types , teratoma studies were conducted in immunode ﬁ cient mice . Teratomas from two Epi - piPSC - FLB2i and three Epi - piPSC - FL6i sublines were compared with those from three well characterized iPSC lines ( a transgene free human iPSC , Epi - hiPSC and two Lv reporgrammed piPSC ( Lv - piPSC - F ) and Lv - piPSC - FL6i ) ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . All were able to produce encapsulated solid tumors that were removed between Fig . 1 . a Live cell images of H1 hESC and Lv - piPSC under F and NHSM conditions with bars , 200 µm and AP staining images in NHSM condition with bars , 5 mm . b AP staining images of LV - piPSC following removal of individual components from NHSM .

Cell Death Discovery ( 2019 ) 5 : 104 Page 5 of 14 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association days 38 ~ 90 after the injection . As expected , the Epi - hiPSC teratoma ( Fig . 5a ) included tissue representative of ectoderm , endoderm , and mesoderm , and POU5F1 expression was almost absent ( Fig . 5a ) . The tumors pro - duced by Epi - piPSC - FLB2i , Epi - piPSC - FL6i and Epi - hiPSC were softer than the Lv - piPSC teratomas and contained hemorrhagic areas when they were examined in cross - section ( Figs . 5a – c ) . The tumor derived from Epi - piPSC - FLB2i lacked apparent endoderm derivatives but contained ectoderm and mesoderm ( Fig . 5b ) . The tissue contained islands of POU5F1 expression between more differentiated areas ( Fig . 5b ) . However , the tumors from Epi - piPSC - FL6i had overall lower POU5F1 expression than those from the Epi - piPSC - FLB2i and also contained diverse tissue types representative of ectoderm , endoderm and mesoderm ( Fig . 5c ) . By contrast , the Lv - piPSC - F and Lv - piPSC - FL6i lines formed homogeneous tumors when viewed in cross section ( Figs . 5d , e ) . The tumors were also largely undifferentiated , with a majority of POU5F1 - positive cells . Nevertheless , islands of ectoderm , meso - derm and endoderm were scattered throughout the tissue from the Lv - piPSC - F lines ( Fig . 5d ) . Tumors from Lv - piPSC - FL6i lines had a largely undifferentiated morphol - ogy and were POU5F1 - positive throughout , except in diffused eosinophilic cells of connective tissue ( Fig . 5e ) . Attempts to generate pESC with the modi ﬁ ed media First , we attempted to generate primed - type pESC in standard FGF2 - supplemented medium , i . e . , pESM con - ditions 7 ( termed F ) from either day 7 – 8 intact blastocysts or immunosurgery isolated ICM 38 . Both approaches yielded similar types of outgrowth at similar ef ﬁ ciencies . Higher outgrowth ef ﬁ ciency was achieved with embryos that were beginning to hatch ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . The all outgrowths were similar in morphology and were positive for AP . Attempts were also made to generate pESC under FL6i ( from both blastocysts and ICM , Supplementary Table 2 ) and FLB2i ( from blastocysts only ) culture conditions . Fewer outgrowths were observed than under F , and all the attached colonies were unstable , i . e . quickly differentiated and stopped proliferating within two weeks ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 1b , c ) . As an alternative to using these two de ﬁ ned media , outgrowths were generated under F Fig . 2 a Live cell images of Lv - piPSC under F and FL6i conditions with bar , 400 µm . b Cell proliferation curve ( upper panel ) and live cell images ( bottom panel , bar , 500 µm ) of Lv - piPSC treated with 1 µM PD173074 ( FGFRi ) , 0 . 6 µM JAK Inhibitor I ( JAKi ) or control in F and FL6i conditions . c ICC of pluripotency markers , POU5F1 , SOX2 , SSEA - 1 and NANOG , in Lv - piPSC under F and FL6i conditions with bars , 200 and 100 µm . d The relative expression level of pluripotency genes in Lv - piPSC under FL6i conditions determined by qPCR .

Cell Death Discovery ( 2019 ) 5 : 104 Page 6 of 14 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association ( termed pESC like cells , pESCLC - primary ; Figs . 6a , b , Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . These outgrowths were manually passaged and maintained in F ( named pESCLC - F ) 7 , Some of the primary outgrowths were also switched to FLB2i and FL6i conditions ( Fig . 6a ) . Further growth on FLB2i failed , but , in FL6i conditions , small foci ( 50 – 80 µm in diameter ) became visible within the colonies ( Supple - mentary Fig . 1d ) and adopted dome - shaped morphologies ( Fig . 6e , Supplementary Fig . 1f ) . From these small foci , we generated a continuously proliferating cell line ( named pESCLC - FL6i ) , whose morphologies resembled the earlier described Epi - piPSC - FL6i . After 10 - day culture under FL6i , some of the colonies were sub - cultured into FLB2i conditions , and they continued to proliferate , forming mounded colonies resembling the Epi - iPSC - FLB2i colo - nies described earlier ( Fig . 6d , Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . Thenceforth , all three lines , pESCLC - F , pESCLC - FLB2i and pESCLC - FL6i were manually passaged every 4 – 7 days on iMEF feeders . Each cell line proliferated for at least 15 passages over a ~ 2 - month period . All three pESCLC lines were examined for expression of POU5F1 , NANOG , SOX2 and AP at 16 , ~ 34 , and ~ 46 days ( passage numbers 2 , 6 , and 9 , respectively ) , and compared with initial blastocyst outgrowths ( pESCLC - primary ) that had been collected at day 8 ~ 10 ( Figs . 6b – e ) . The pESCLC - primary outgrowths expressed all three pluripotent markers examined ( Fig . 6b ) . However , the cell cultures continued in F ( pESCLC - F ) showed increasingly lower SOX2 and POU5F1 expressions although NANOG and AP activity remained relatively constant ( Fig . 6c ) . When the pESCLC were maintained in FLB2i ( Fig . 6d ) or FL6i ( Fig . 6e ) , the marker expressions persisted without obvious decline . Comparative gene expression analysis of cell lines Transcriptome pro ﬁ les of the three putative pESC ( pESCLC - F , pESCLC - FLB2i , pESCLC - FL6i ) , the three piPSC lines ( Lv - piPSC - F , Epi - piPSC - FLB2i , Epi - piPSC - FL6i ) , each in duplicate representing different passage number , and two primary blastocyst outgrowths were compared by using RNAseq . A heatmap analysis of 19 known porcine genes whose expression has been linked to pluripotency 19 was then generated ( Fig . 6f ) . The primary blastocyst outgrowths ( pESCLC - primary ) had the most Fig . 3 Live cell images of ‘ primary colonies ’ ( a ) and established colonies after 40 days of “ extended culture ” ( b ) of Epi - piPSC under the three culture conditions . c ICC of POU5F1 of Epi - piPSC under the three conditions after 40 days of extended culture . d AP staining and ICC of NANOG , SSEA1 , SSEA4 and SOX2 of Epi - piPSC lines established in FLB2i and FL6i conditions Yuan et al . Cell Death Discovery ( 2019 ) 5 : 104 Page 7 of 14 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association consistent upregulation of expression of these genes , including POU5F1 and NANOG , relative to any of the cell lines . One other feature of these primary cultures was relatively low SOX2 , ESRRB , and KLF4 expression . How - ever subsequent culture of these pESCLC cells in either FLB2i or FL6i medium led to a down regulation of the majority of these pluripotency genes , including POU5F1 and NANOG but not SOX2 . By contrast , continued cul - ture under F , had a more minor effect , although some key genes , e . g . , POU5F1 , SOX2 , and ESRRB became expressed at lower levels than in their primary progenitors . Of the remaining cell lines , the lentivirus - transformed cells ( Lv - piPSC ) cultured on F medium clustered most closely to the blastocyst outgrowths , followed by the episomally - transformed cells ( Epi - piPSC ) , cultured on FL6i medium , although in both there was marked down regulation of TET2 and TET3 genes ( Fig . 6f ) . A principle component analysis ( PCA ) based on RNA - seq data showed distinct distributions according to how the cells were created ( pESCLC vs . piPSC ) and culture conditions ( Fig . 7a ) . The pESCLC lines were clearly separated according to the culture conditions , i . e . , F vs . FL6i / FLB2i , on the PC1 dimension while Epi - piPSC ( FL6i vs . FLB2i ) lines showed differences primarily by PC2 values . Although the Lv - piPSC was grown in F , it showed a close relationship with Epi - piPSC cultured under FL6i conditions . We also compared the cell lines by hierarchical clus - tering of differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ; fold change ≥ 3 , adjusted p ≤ 0 . 05 ) ( Supplementary Fig . 2 and Supplementary Table 5 ) . Here the culture conditions appeared to provide the greatest discrimination between groupings . Only 242 DEGs out of 17 , 650 genes analyzed distinguished the pESCLC - primary and pESCLC - F . Far Fig . 4 . Quantitative comparison of endogenous ( a ) and exogenous ( b , c ) pluripotency marker expressions in Epi - piPSC - FLB2i , Epi - piPSC - FL6i and Lv - piPSC - F linesThe relative expression levels of the target genes were normalized against the expression level of GAPDH from the same sample ( set as 1 ) . Expression of the endogenous porcine genes ( pPOU5F1 , pSOX2 , pNANOG in ( a ) and exogenous human genes ( hPOU5F1 , hSOX2 in ( b ) were determined by species speci ﬁ c primers for respective coding sequences . Expression values from the episomal plasmids ( plasmid POU5F1 , plasmid SOX2 , plasmid LIN28 in ( c ) were quanti ﬁ ed by paired primers of gene speci ﬁ c and the plasmid backbone . The primer information is shown in Supplementary Table 4 Yuan et al . Cell Death Discovery ( 2019 ) 5 : 104 Page 8 of 14 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association larger numbers of DEGs separated pESC - primary from both pESC - FLB2i ( 1 , 945 DEGs from 18 , 085 ) and pESCLC - primary vs pESCLC - FL6i ( 2 , 058 DEGs from 18 , 110 ) , which is consistent with the PCA analysis ( Fig . 7a ) . Gene Ontology ( GO ) enrichment analysis was used to gain insights into the degree to which the different cell lines showed signs of differentiation . ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . The top 10 categories in the overall GO list for all cell lines included developmental process , ectoderm devel - opment , cell differentiation , mesoderm development , and cell signaling pathways . Based on this outcome , we ana - lyzed the relative expressions of 27 genes linked to early embryonic differentiation 50 , 51 ( Fig . 7b ) . The pESCLC - primary and pESCLC - F group were again widely sepa - rated from the others , largely due to the high expression of genes of all the principal early embryonic lineages with the exception of ectoderm . The cell line that showed the lowest expression of differentiation markers was the Epi - piPSC - FL6i . In fact , differentiation markers for mesoderm and endoderm were relatively low in all FLB2i and FL6i cultures and in the Lv - piPSC - F , although there appeared to be some up - regulation of ectoderm markers . We next focused on DEGs linked to seven major sig - naling pathways ( Fig . 7c ) 51 , 52 . Genes associated with TGFB and BMP signaling were upregulated in pESCLC - primary and pESCLC - F group , whereas low Notch and BMP signaling distinguished the Lv - piPSC and the Epi - piPSC grown on FL6i medium from the rest ( Fig . 7c ) . Discussion Here we have demonstrated that primed type Lv - piPSC transition to naïve - like pluripotency under the FL6i con - ditions . One major change made in FL6i relative to the original NHSM 27 is the replacement of TGFB1 with a TGFB inhibitor , SB431542 . TGFB1 activates ERK / MAPK signaling by SHC1 ( SHC - transforming protein 1 ) phos - phorylation as well as via SMAD2 / 3 signaling , both of Fig . 5 Tumor tissues generated from different porcine iPSC in immunode ﬁ cient mice .

Cell Death Discovery ( 2019 ) 5 : 104 Page 9 of 14 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association which are crucial for the maintenance of pluripotency in epiblast - type human PSC 53 , 54 . In contrast , TGFB1 is dis - pensable for the maintenance of naïve state mouse ESC 55 , although inhibition of TGFB signaling improves iPSC reprogramming ef ﬁ ciency 56 and helps prevent rat PSC from spontaneously differentiating 57 , 58 . The role of TGFB signaling in maintaining porcine pluripotency is less clear . TGFB / ACTIVIN / NODAL signaling is required for self - renewal of primed - type piPSC 59 and putative porcine epiblast stem cells 6 . On the other hand , the TGFB / ACTIVIN inhibitor , SB431542 , used in our experiments has been employed in a number of other protocols for generating piPSC 10 , 60 , 61 . Interestingly , all the piPSC gen - erated in presence of SB431542 had morphologies similar to naïve state mouse ESC , whereas piPSC and pESCLC dependent on TGFB were in the primed state . Thus , like human and mouse , primed state pluripotency in porcine cells is probably dependent on the activation of SMAD2 62 , 63 , while naïve state pluripotency requires inhibition of TGFB signaling 64 .

Cell Death Discovery ( 2019 ) 5 : 104 Page 10 of 14 Of ﬁ cial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association In contrast to TGFB1 , BMP4 signaling favors SMAD1 / 5 / 8 signaling , which , in turn , causes the activation of inhibitors of DNA binding proteins ( IDs ) . In mouse naïve - type ESC , for example , BMP4 suppresses differentiation and , in combination with LIF , sustains self - renewal 65 . BMP4 inhibition also assists the stabilization of human ESCs in what is sometimes considered to be a ground state , i . e . naïve - type 26 . The NHSM also contains BMP inhibitor as an optional component to boost human naïve pluripotency 27 . FL6i , described in this paper , contains both inhibitors of TGFB1 and BMP . Under such condi - tions the Lv - piPSC demonstrated more compact , dome - shaped colony morphology , a shortened cell doubling time , increased AP activity , and tolerance to single cell passage , which are hallmarks of mouse , naïve state , PSC . FL6i also enhanced the expression of endogenous plur - ipotent genes , including NANOG , POU5F1 , SOX2 , MYC , and ZFP42 , although the expression of the ectopic reprogramming genes remained high ( Fig . 2d ) . We inferred that FL6i promoted porcine pluripotency and might , therefore , support the derivation of piPSC without accompanying transgene integration . Accordingly , we then attempted to generate piPSC from porcine embryonic ﬁ broblasts in FL6i medium as well as in two other culture conditions via non - integrating epi - somal vectors 35 . The control medium containing FGF2 and LIF but no small molecule additions , did yield pri - mary colonies ( Epi - piPSC - F ) , although it proved impos - sible to derive stable cell lines from these starter colonies over extended culture ( Figs . 3a – c ) With both FL6i and FLB2i conditions , colonies with a naïve - type phenotypes were readily generated and propagated successfully over several weeks without either apparent loss of self - renewal or signs of differentiation ( Fig . 3 ) . However , none of the cell lines established were transgene - free at this stage ( Fig . 4 ) , although endogenous pluripotency genes were upregulated ( Fig . 4 ) and expression of early differentiation genes low ( Fig . 7b ) . FL6i culture conditions , in particular , provided piPSC superior to those cultured under FLB2i conditions with upregulation of the 19 - gene cohort of Fig . 7 Comparative gene expression analysis of three piPSC ( Lv - piPSC , Epi - piPSC - FLB2i and Epi - piPSC - FL6i ) and three pESCLC ( pESCLC - F , pESCLC - FLB2i , pESCLC - FL6i ) lines and primary blastocyst outgrowth ( pESCLC - primary ) . a PCA based on RNAseq data from the seven cell samples in duplicate . b Heatmap of 27 genes linked to early embryonic differentiation to ectoderm , mesoderm , endoderm , primitive endoderm and trophectoderm from duplicated seven cell samples . c Heatmap of 54 genes of seven major signaling pathways ( Notch , FGF , JAK - STAT3 , WNT , p38 ( MAPK14 ) , TGFB and BMP ) associated genes in each cell types Yuan et al .

A recent study employed the same episomal plasmid approach as ours with 2i plus FGF2 condition 14 . Like ours , the generated piPSC showed pre - sence of vector DNA , but integration - free piPSC could be selected from the low passage cells by further subcloning . We conclude that the piPSC generated under FL6i con - ditions have considerable promise . Reprogramming via ectopic transcription factors , as illustrated here with episomal plasmids has been cate - gorized into two phases 66 . First , a stochastic phase in which expression of transgenes triggers random epige - netic events that cause global changes of the somatic epigenome into an ESC - like status 67 . Possibly , repro - gramming in the basal FL medium initiated these events but did not allow progression to the second , deterministic phase , in which the presence of inhibitors , is believed to enhance the expression of endogenous pluripotency genes needed to sustain a stable pluripotency state 66 – 68 . In the third part of this study , we attempted to generate pESC under different culture conditions . Efforts to obtain pESC directly from blastocysts under FLB2i and FL6i conditions failed . By contrast , basal FGF2 medium allowed initial attachment and colony formation , while subsequent culture under FLB2i and FL6i conditions permitted cell lines indistinguishable in appearance to naïve type piPSC to be isolated . Although the initial blastocyst outgrowths demonstrated relatively robust expression of genes associated with the pluripotent state ( Fig . 6f ) they also had higher level expression of early differentiation markers representing mesoderm , endo - derm , primitive endoderm and extraembryonic lineages ( Fig . 7b ) . Although these differentiation markers were downregulated in pESCLC under FLB2i and FL6i condi - tions , there remained a higher level of ectoderm markers ( Fig . 7b ) and relatively weak expression of the cohort of pluripotency genes ( Fig . 6f ) . We conclude that these cell lines are still less than ideal as bona ﬁ de ESC . Stable bovine ESC lines were recently derived from preimplantation blastocysts by employing supplementary FGF2 and a WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 69 . A pos - sible explanation for why FGF and WNT signaling inhi - bition in combination capture bovine pluripotency is their ability to regulate the balance of lineage speci ﬁ cation between mesoendoderm and ectoderm 70 – 72 . It appears that this equilibrium is more dif ﬁ cult to achieve in pESC . While FLB2i and FL6i conditions appear capable of blocking differentiation towards mesoendoderm , the cells seemed more prone to differentiate into ectoderm ( Fig . 7b ) . Additionally , it is apparent that TGFB and BMP signaling must also be blocked in order to advance towards a pluripotent state in pESC . For example , there was a signi ﬁ cant downregulation of the gene markers representing these two pathways in our Epi - piPSC - FL6i and Lv - piPSC but an upregulation under other FGF2 conditions ( Fig . 7c ) . These observations may lead to optimized culture conditions that allow derivation of stable pESC in the near future . In conclusion , we report culture conditions of FL6i that support enhanced naïve - state pluripotency in Epi - piPSC . In particular , blocking the TGFB and BMP signaling pathways was an essential issue in reaching this goal . Although the ﬁ nal goal of generating transgene - free piPSC and authentic pESC by using the FL6i medium has not been achieved , the cell lines created point the way to establishing protocols that will ﬁ nally allow stable , fully pluripotent porcine ESC and iPSC to be generated for potential biomedical and agricultural purposes .
