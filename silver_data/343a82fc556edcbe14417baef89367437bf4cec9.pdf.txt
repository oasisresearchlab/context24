A r t i c l e s 1160 VOLUME 22 | NUMBER 10 | OCTOBER 2016 nAture medicine The incidence of trauma - , sports - and age - related musculoskeletal injuries have dramatically increased in recent years , causing exten - sive medical and socioeconomic burdens 1 . Conventional orthopedic implants made of permanent rigid metals ( such as stainless steel or titanium ) remove mechanical stress normally loaded onto the bone , known as ‘stress shielding , ’ which precludes load - stimulated bone remodeling and results in gradual bone loss , thus retarding bone - fracture healing 2 . Biodegradable metals , which corrode gradually in vivo during the bone - healing process and release corrosion products beneficial to this process , are thought to be more desirable orthopedic implants because they avoid implant - removal surgery and its associated complications ( such as refracture and infections ) 3 . Magnesium is an essential element that is crucial for bone health 4 , 5 , and ~ 60 % of magnesium in the human body is stored in the bone matrix 6 . Magnesium deficiency leads to osteoporosis , and its supple - mentation is known to be beneficial to patients with osteoporosis 7 . Possessing a mechanical property similar to that of natural bone , as well as greater stiffness than ceramic biomaterials 6 , 8 , magnesium is considered to be a potential , biodegradable orthopedic implant for the fixation of bone fractures and pseudoarthosis 9 . Pure magnesium , however , is quickly degraded in vivo and does not provide prolonged mechanical support for fracture healing . We and other groups have developed magnesium - based alloys or bulk metallic glasses ( BMGs ) , which indeed have shown promising osteogenic effects during 1 Musculoskeletal Research Laboratory , Department of Orthopedics & Traumatology , The Chinese University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong , PR China . 2 Epithelial Cell Biology Research Centre , School of Biomedical Sciences , Faculty of Medicine , The Chinese University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong , PR China . 3 School of Biomedical Sciences , Faculty of Medicine , The Chinese University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong , PR China . 4 Department of Biochemistry , Rush University , Chicago , USA . 5 Department of Biomedical Sciences , Baylor College of Dentistry , Texas A & M Health Science Center , Dallas , Texas , USA . 6 Division of Life Science , The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology , Kowloon , Hong Kong , PR China . 7 Department of Orthopedics , Dalian University Zhongshan Hospital , Dalian , PR China . 8 Department of Rehabilitation Sciences , The Hong Kong Polytechnic University , Hong Kong , PR China . 9 Julius Wolff Institute and Center for Musculoskeletal Surgery , Charité—Universitätsmedizin Berlin , Berlin , Germany . 10 Berlin - Brandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies , Charité—Universitätsmedizin Berlin , Berlin , Germany . 11 Department of Materials Science and Engineering , College of Engineering , Peking University , Beijing , PR China . 12 Translational Medicine Research & Development Center , Institute of Biomedical and Health Engineering , Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology , Shenzhen , PR China . 13 Present address : Department of Sports Medicine and Adult Reconstructive Surgery , Drum Tower Hospital , School of Medicine , Nanjing University , Nanjing , Jiangsu , PR China . 14 These authors contributed equally to this work .

Here we show the formation of abundant new bone at peripheral cortical sites after intramedullary implantation of a pin containing ultrapure magnesium into the intact distal femur in rats . This response was accompanied by substantial increases of neuronal calcitonin gene - related polypeptide - a ( CGRP ) in both the peripheral cortex of the femur and the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglia ( DRG ) . Surgical removal of the periosteum , capsaicin denervation of sensory nerves or knockdown in vivo of the CGRP - receptor - encoding genes Calcrl or Ramp1 substantially reversed the magnesium - induced osteogenesis that we observed in this model . Overexpression of these genes , however , enhanced magnesium - induced osteogenesis . We further found that an elevation of extracellular magnesium induces magnesium transporter 1 ( MAGT1 ) - dependent and transient receptor potential cation channel , subfamily M , member 7 ( TRPM7 ) - dependent magnesium entry , as well as an increase in intracellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and the accumulation of terminal synaptic vesicles in isolated rat DRG neurons . In isolated rat periosteum - derived stem cells , CGRP induces CALCRL - and RAMP1 - dependent activation of cAMP - responsive element binding protein 1 ( CREB1 ) and SP7 ( also known as osterix ) , and thus enhances osteogenic differentiation of these stem cells . Furthermore , we have developed an innovative , magnesium - containing intramedullary nail that facilitates femur fracture repair in rats with ovariectomy - induced osteoporosis . Taken together , these findings reveal a previously undefined role of magnesium in promoting CGRP - mediated osteogenic differentiation , which suggests the therapeutic potential of this ion in orthopedics . n p g © 201 6 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . A r t i c l e s nAture medicine VOLUME 22 | NUMBER 10 | OCTOBER 2016 1161 bone - fracture healing 3 , 8 , 10 – 13 . These alloys or BMGs , composed of magnesium , calcium , zinc and strontium , have good corrosion resistance—and thus presumably minor hydrogen production—after implantation into the bone 3 , 14 . However , whether magnesium actively contributes to the observed osteogenic effects of these alloys or BMGs remains unclear because other composited elements ( such as stron - tium ) are also reported to promote bone formation 15 , 16 . Therefore , in the present study , we used ultrapure magnesium and investigated its possible effects on bone formation , as well as the underlying molecular mechanism . In long bones , the periosteum , a connective tissue membrane cov - ering the outer surface of bone , has been shown to be important to the integrity , modeling and remodeling of bone , particularly dur - ing fracture repair 17 , because a large number of mesenchymal stem cells essential for osteogenesis are from the cambium layer of the periosteum . These cells are known as periosteum - derived stem cells ( PDSCs ) 18 . In addition , the periosteum contains sensory nerves that release neuropeptides known to be involved in osteogenesis 19 , 20 . Among them , CGRP is suggested to be the most important osteo - anabolic peptide 21 . Of note , our previous studies have shown that the implantation of magnesium - based alloys or BMGs into the distal femur in rodents gives rise to increased cortical - bone thickness , with new bone formed at the peripheral cortex next to the periosteum 3 , 10 , 12 . We therefore speculated that magnesium might be released from the intramedullary implant into the periosteum , and that PDSCs and sensory nerves in the periosteum might have a role in magnesium - induced bone formation . To provide magnesium implants with sustained mechanical strength for the fixation and healing of long - bone fractures , we also developed an innovative intramedullary nail ( IMN ) containing mag - nesium ( Mg - IMN ) and investigated its effect on fracture healing in rats with ovariectomy - induced osteoporosis . RESULTS Role of the periosteum in magnesium - induced bone formation We first used a nonfractured femur model to confirm the osteo - genic effect of magnesium . We surgically implanted either a 99 . 99 % - pure magnesium rod or , as a control , a stainless steel rod into the medullary cavity of the intact femur in rats . At week 2 after surgery , µ X - ray fluorescence ( Supplementary Fig . 1a – d ) and scan - ning electron microscopy ( Supplementary Fig . 1e – h ) revealed a remarkably higher magnesium concentration in the cortical bone and bone – periosteum junction of the magnesium - implanted femora , as compared to that of the controls , which suggests the diffusion of magnesium from the implant across the bone toward the peri - osteum . Meanwhile , H & E staining and calcein labeling showed a substantially larger amount of new bone formation , mainly at the peripheral cortex , in magnesium - implanted femora , as compared to the controls ( Fig . 1a ) . Micro - computed tomography ( CT ) meas - urements confirmed significantly higher total bone tissue volume ( TV ) , high - density bone volume ( BV ) and ρ - moment of inertia ( ρ MOI ) in magnesium - implanted femora , as compared to that in controls ( Fig . 1b , c ) . To evaluate the role of the periosteum in magnesium - induced new - bone formation , we surgically removed the periosteum when magnesium rods were implanted . As a result , new bone was no longer formed at regions where the periosteum had been removed success - fully , and was instead found only at peripheral cortex that contained residual periosteum , as shown by both radiographs and micro - CT ( Fig . 1b , c and Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . CGRP is involved in magnesium - induced bone formation To test the possible role of sensory nerves in the periosteum in the osteogenic effect of magnesium , we destroyed the sensory nerves by injecting high - dose capsaicin into the dorsal spine in rats , as previ - ously reported 22 . Consequently , the degree of magnesium - induced new - bone formation was significantly lower than that in the group without capsaicin treatment ( Fig . 1d , e ) . Moreover , similarly to the effect of implanted magnesium rods , the injection of MgCl 2 ( 10 mM in a volume of 100 µ l , daily for 3 d ) directly at one side of the L3 – L5 lumbar spine also induced new bone formation at the peripheral cortex of the ipsilateral femur ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . In magne - sium - implanted femora at week 2 after surgery , immunofluorescence staining showed abundant CGRP in peripheral cortical bone , whereas in controls , only scattered CGRP labeling was found ( Fig . 1f ) . ELISA analysis showed that the concentration of CGRP in bone tissues was higher after magnesium implantation , which peaked at day 4 with a value eight - fold higher than the controls , and was lower at day 7 and 14 , as compared to day 4 , but the values were still two - fold higher than the controls ( Fig . 1f ) . In addition , at week 2 after surgery , substantially higher expression of CGRP was also found in L4 DRGs in rats with magnesium implantation , as compared to the controls ( Fig . 1g ) . We also measured the concentrations of other sensory neuropep - tides , including substance P , neurokinins and galanin , in implanted femora , given that beneficial effects on bone healing have also been reported for these 23 , 24 . ELISA analysis showed that the concentration of substance P was higher by approximately one - fold at day 4 , whereas neurokinin K and galanin were not notably different after magne - sium implantation , as compared to the control group ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . These results suggest that CGRP might be the predominant neuropeptide contributing to magnesium - induced bone formation . To test this idea , we injected BIBN4096BS ( BIBN , 750 µ g / ml in a volume of 100 µ l , every other day ) , a CGRP - receptor antago - nist , into rat femora in conjunction with magnesium implanta - tion , which resulted in substantially lower TV and BV values in magnesium - implanted femora than in the non - BIBN - treated group ( Supplementary Fig . 2d – f ) . To further confirm the involvement of CGRP and its receptor in magnesium - induced osteogenesis , we injected complementary DNA ( cDNA ) - conjugated and short interfering RNA ( shRNA ) - conjugated adenovirus to overexpress or knockdown calcitonin receptor – like receptor ( Calcrl ) or receptor activity - modifying protein 1 ( Ramp1 , the direct binding site for CGRP ) in rat femur in vivo ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . An in vivo imaging system revealed that fluorescent adenovi - ruses conjugated with Calcrl ( AdV - Calcrl ) or shRNA targeting Calcrl ( AdV - sh Calcrl ) were located at the injected femur with some diffusion to the contralateral femur , yet were undetectable in major metabolic organs ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . PCR and western blot assays con - firmed successful overexpression or knockdown of Calcrl or Ramp1 in the femora ( Supplementary Fig . 3b , c ) . As shown by radiographs ( Fig . 2a ) and calcein / xylenol double labeling ( Fig . 2b ) , Calcrl overexpression by AdV - Calcrl further enhanced magnesium - induced new - bone formation , whereas its knockdown by AdV - sh Calcrl attenuated this process . According to micro - CT analysis , signifi - cantly greater TV and BV , with no difference in BV / TV or bone mineral density ( BMD ) , were observed in magnesium - implanted femora in conjunction with Calcrl overexpression by AdV - Calcrl , as compared to the magnesium - implanted femora treated with scrambled adenoviruses as a negative control ( AdV - NC ) ( Fig . 2c ) . Conversely , significantly lower TV was found in the AdV - sh Calcrl - treated and magnesium - implanted femora than in the n p g © 201 6 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . A r t i c l e s 1162 VOLUME 22 | NUMBER 10 | OCTOBER 2016 nAture medicine magnesium - implanted femora co - treated with AdV - NC ( Fig . 2c ) . Furthermore , we observed substantially greater amounts of calcein - labeled new bone and significantly higher TV and BV in magnesium - implanted femora with Ramp1 - overexpression by AdV - Ramp1 , whereas we observed less calcein - labeling with sig - nificantly lower TV and BV in those with Ramp1 - knockdown by AdV - sh Ramp1 , as compared to the magnesium - implanted femora treated with AdV - NC . ( Fig . 2d , e ) . CGRP is encapsulated by synaptic vesicles and released from the axon terminals of DRG neurons 25 , 26 . Thus , we evaluated the effect of magnesium on synaptic - vesicle aggregation in DRG neurons isolated from rats ( Fig . 3a ) . Immunofluorescence labeling revealed CGRP expression in isolated DRG neurons ( Fig . 3b ) . The synaptic vesicles in the DRG neurons were labeled with a fluorescent dye , FM1 - 43 , and monitored with a live - cell confocal system . In the absence of mag - nesium ions ( Mg 2 + ) in the bath , FM1 - 43 - labeled vesicles were seen mainly in neuron bodies . Upon the addition of MgCl 2 ( 1 mM ) into the bath , FM1 - 43 intensity at neuronal terminals was increased within 5 min . Subsequently , another 1 mM MgCl 2 was added to reach an accumulative concentration of 2 mM , which induced further increase in FM1 - 43 intensity at neuronal terminals ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Video 1 ) , and thus suggests that Mg 2 + induces the movement and aggregation of these vesicles toward neuronal terminals . Because N - methyl - d - glucamin ( NMDG ) is a cell - membrane nonpermeable cation , NMDG - Cl was added as a control , which induced no obvious effect on FM1 - 43 intensity at neuro - nal terminals , excluding the involvement of Cl − in this process ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . In addition , Zn 2 + and Mn 2 + , two divalent cations similar to Mg 2 + , inhibited , rather than promoted , FM1 - 43 - labeled vesicle aggregation ( Supplementary Fig . 4b , c ) . Moreover , the effect of Mg 2 + on vesicle aggregation was abolished in cells pretreated with cytochalasin B ( Fig . 3d ) , which inhibits actin polymerization 27 . In addition , the intracellular ATP concentration was elevated after treating the isolated DRG neurons with Mg 2 + ( Fig . 3e ) . These results therefore suggest that Mg 2 + might promote synaptic - vesicle aggrega - tion by enhancing ATP - facilitated actin polymerization . To examine whether Mg 2 + could enter DRG neurons , we used a Mg 2 + sensitive dye , Mg - Fura2 , to monitor intracellular Mg 2 + a Ctrl Mg 2 + Ctrl Mg 2 + P BM P BM OB NB OB BM OB NB BM OB Ctrl Mg 2 + minus periosteum b c d e f g OB CGRP Mg 2 + Ctrl Mg 2 + Mg 2 + Ctrl Ctrl Mg 2 + Capsaicin Capsaicin + Mg 2 + Ctrl 60 Ctrl Mg 2 + Mg 2 + minus periosteum * * * * * * ( 7 ) ( 7 ) ( 10 ) ( 7 ) ( 7 ) ( 7 ) ( 7 ) ( 7 ) ( 10 ) 40 20 0 T V ( mm 3 ) 60 40 20 0 BV ( mm 3 ) 30 20 10 0 ρ M O I ( mm 4 ) 60 40 20 0 T V ( mm 3 ) 60 40 20 0 BV ( mm 3 ) 1 . 1 1 . 0 0 . 9 0 . 8 1 , 000 900 800 700 600 1 , 000 900 800 700 600 B M D o f T V ( m g H A / c m 3 ) B M D o f BV ( m g H A / c m 3 ) Ctrl ( n = 6 ) Mg ( n = 7 ) Capsaicin ( n = 6 ) Capsaicin + Mg 2 + ( n = 6 ) BV / T V 300 CtrlMg 2 + C G R P ( pg / m l ) 200 100 0 1 4 7 * * * * * * * * * * * Time ( d ) 14 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Mg 2 + Figure 1 Periosteum - dependent new - bone formation induced by magnesium in rat femur .

The results showed that the addition of MgCl 2 ( 10 mM ) into the Mg 2 + - free bath induced a notable increase in [ Mg 2 + ] i , indicating the entry of Mg 2 + into DRG neurons . Given that TRPM6 , TRPM7 and MAGT1 are reported to transport Mg 2 + across cell membranes 28 , 29 , we also examined the effects of their blockers ( Fig . 3f ) . The results showed that Mg 2 + - entry was significantly inhibited by nitrendipine ( 50 µ M , inhibit - ing MAGT1 ( ref . 30 ) ) or 2 - aminoethoxydiphenyl borate ( 2 - APB ) ( 100 µ M , inhibiting TRPM7 ( ref . 31 ) ) , but not by ruthenium red ( 50 µ M , inhibiting TRPM6 ( ref . 32 ) ) . CGRP promotes the osteogenic differentiation of PDSCs In magnesium - implanted femora , we detected numerous cells at the region between the periosteum and newly formed bone ( Fig . 4a ) , which are presumably PDSCs . We isolated the cells from the peri - osteum of rat femora , and they were positively labeled with stem cell markers ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) , which suggests that they are PDSCs . Consistently with results in vivo , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and alizarin red ( AR ) staining showed greater osteogenic differen - tiation capacity of PDSCs isolated from magnesium - implanted rat femora , as compared to those from stainless - steel - implanted ( as con - trol , Ctrl ) or nonimplanted ( as blank control , Blk ) femora ( Fig . 4b ) . To verify a role for CGRP in the mediation of magnesium - induced osteogenesis , we examined the effects of CGRP on isolated PDSCs . First , no increase in the proliferation of PDSCs by CGRP ( up to 10 −8 M ) was observed ( Fig . 4c ) . We next induced osteogenic differentia - tion of PDSCs in the presence of CGRP . Real - time PCR results showed that the treatment of PDSCs with CGRP ( 10 −12 – 10 −8 M ) for 2 weeks significantly promoted transcription of the osteogenic markers Alp , Bglap and Opn in a concentration - dependent manner ( Fig . 4d ) . As shown by ALP and AR staining , the CGRP - induced osteogenic dif - ferentiation of PDSCs was promoted by AdV - based overexpression of Calcrl or Ramp1 and diminished by their knockdown ( Fig . 4e and Supplementary Fig . 3d ) .

A r t i c l e s 1164 VOLUME 22 | NUMBER 10 | OCTOBER 2016 nAture medicine Activation of the CGRP receptor initiates the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) - signaling pathway , which can lead to phos - phorylation of the transcription factor CREB1 ( ref . 33 ) , which subse - quently activates Sp7 transcription factor ( SP7 , also known as Osterix ) and runt - related transcription factor 2 ( RUNX2 ) , two other transcrip - tion factors that are known to be crucial for osteogenesis 34 , 35 . We there - fore examined these transcription factors in CGRP - treated PDSCs . Western blot results showed that treatment with CGRP ( 10 −10 M , 72 h ) resulted in greater levels of phosphorylated ( p ) CREB1 and SP7 in PDSCs as compared to those without CGRP treatment , which was blunted by AdV - sh Calcrl - induced Calcrl knockdown ( Fig . 4f ) . No remarkable change in RUNX2 expression was found ( Fig . 4f ) . We also examined the effect of conditioned medium from DRG neuron cultures on the osteogenic differentiation of PDSCs . DRG neurons were cultured in the absence or presence of MgCl 2 ( 2 mM ) for 3 d before the conditioned medium was collected . As shown by ALP and AR staining , treating the PDSCs with Mg 2 + - conditioned , neuronal - culture medium facilitated the cells’ osteogenic differen - tiation , as compared to cells treated with the control medium , and this facilitation was inhibited in cells with Calcrl knocked down by AdV - sh Calcrl ( Fig . 4g ) . Mg - IMN promotes fracture healing In spite of the observed osteogenic effects , pure magnesium rods failed to fix long - bone fractures in mice 3 weeks after implantation ( Supplementary Fig . 6a ) , probably owing to degradation of the rod and thus deterioration of its mechanical strength over time . To trans - late the osteogenic effect of magnesium for orthopedic application , we developed a ‘bioactive’ Mg - IMN by inserting a magnesium rod into a hollow IMN made of stainless steel with holes drilled in the middle of the nail as vents for magnesium release ( Supplementary Fig . 6b , c ) . Finite elemental analysis ( FEA ) of the designed Mg - IMN suggested that its mechanical strength was comparable to that of nondrilled nails ( Supplementary Fig . 6d ) . We then tested the ability of the Mg - IMN system to heal fractured femurs in rats with ovariectomy - induced osteoporosis , as compared to an IMN implant without a magnesium insert . Given the suggested involvement of the periosteum in the beneficial effects of magne - sium on fracture healing , we used a closed femora fracture model ( see Online Methods ) in which the periosteum remained intact during bone injury . We first confirmed diffusion of magnesium from the Mg - IMN system into the bone and the periosteum ( Supplementary Fig . 6e ) , as was seen similarly with the use of the pure - magnesium rod in intact femora ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . X - ray analysis showed that at week 4 after implantation , both the width and area of callus in the Mg - IMN - implanted group were significantly larger than those in the IMN group , although no difference between the two groups was found at week 6 , 8 or 12 ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Micro - CT results showed greater TV and BV , but lower BV / TV , in the Mg - IMN group , as compared to the IMN group , at week 4 ( Fig . 5c and Supplementary Fig . 7a ) . At later weeks after implantation , the TV of the Mg - IMN group was lower and no longer different than that of the IMN group ( Fig . 5c ) .

The BMD of TV in the Mg - IMN group was lower at week 4 , but higher at week 12 , than that of the IMN group ( Fig . 5c ) . These results suggested that more callus tissue was formed at the early stage of fracture healing , and that the mineralization process was accelerated at later stages in the Mg - IMN group , as compared to the IMN group . Importantly , a four - point bending biomechanical test at week 12 showed a significantly greater maximum compressive load of the femoral shafts in the Mg - IMN group than in the IMN group ( Fig . 5d ) . Histomorphometric analysis suggested a typical pattern of sec - ondary fracture healing , with callus formation , intramembranous ossification and endochondral ossification identified in all the sam - ples ( Fig . 5e , f and Supplementary Fig . 7b ) . More periosteal woven bone , accompanied by elevated CGRP expression in the callus , at week 2 and more endochondral tissue at week 4 were seen in the Mg - IMN group relative to the IMN group ( Fig . 5e , f and Supplementary Fig . 7c ) . From week 8 to 12 , woven bone and endochondral tissue were gradually replaced by lamellar structure bridging the fracture gap ( Supplementary Fig . 7b ) . Polarized light images to identify collagen fibers revealed a better alignment of the collagen fibers inside the callus in the Mg - IMN group at week 4 , as com - pared to that in the IMN group ( Fig . 5f ) . More bright fibers and regular lamellar bone was found in the Mg - IMN group than in the IMN group , indicating advanced remodeling with better lamellar alignment , and therefore , presenting a superior mechanical property in the Mg - IMN group . Moreover , calcein / xylenol double labeling suggested accelerated new - bone formation in the Mg - IMN group from week 4 to 8 , as compared to the IMN group ( Fig . 5g , h ) . At week 12 , the ratio of xylenol / calcein staining of the Mg - IMN group was significantly lower than that of the IMN group , suggesting the formation of mature lamellar bone tissue ( Fig . 5g , h ) .

In addition , double staining for the proliferation marker Ki67 and the osteoblast marker RUNX2 showed a significantly ( P < 0 . 001 ) larger number of cells at week 2 expressing both Ki67 and RUNX2 in the fracture callus of the Mg - IMN group than in that of the IMN group ( Supplementary Fig . 7e ) . Consistently , in cells of the osteoblast line MC3T3 - E1 , the addition of CGRP ( 10 −10 M ) in culture medium promoted greater cell proliferation , as compared to control treatment ( Supplementary Fig . 7f ) . Such enhanced proliferation of osteoblasts might underlie the larger callus size observed at an early stage of fracture healing in Mg - IMN - implanted femora ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Given that CGRP sensory nerves are associated with pain , we tested pain levels in rats that received implantations by measuring the alternation of gait pattern , using the automated CatWalk system 36 , 37 . In both IMN and Mg - IMN groups , the limb idleness index ( LII ) score increased and the print area ( at the implanted side ) decreased at week 1 after implantation , as compared to that before the surgery , indicat - ing pain ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . However , neither LII nor print area differed between the Mg - IMN and IMN group at weeks 1 and 2 ( Supplementary Fig . 8a , b ) , which suggests similar gait patterns and pain levels , even though at day 4 , CGRP expression was considerably higher in the Mg - IMN group than in the IMN group ( Supplementary Fig . 8c ) . Because aberrant sprouting of nerve fibers can also cause pain , we examined the growth of nerve fibers 1 – 14 d after surgery . The expression of growth - associated protein 43 , a marker for newly generated nerves 38 , although initially higher at day 4 , was significantly g 4 8 12 Calcein Xylenol Merge IMN Mg - IMN IMN Mg - IMN IMN Mg - IMN T i m e ( w ee ks ) Time ( weeks ) 0 2 4 8 12 a IMN Mg – IMN IMN Mg – IMN IMN Mg – IMN IMN Mg – IMN IMN Mg – IMN b 30 20 15 10 2 4 6 8 12 Time ( weeks ) 2 4 6 8 12 Time ( weeks ) Mg - IMN IMN ( 6 ) ( 6 ) ( 6 ) ( 6 ) ( 6 ) ( 6 ) ( 8 ) ( 8 ) ( 8 ) ( 8 ) ( 8 ) ( 8 ) ( 6 ) ( 6 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 9 ) ( 9 ) ( 7 ) ( 7 ) * * * * C a ll u s a r ea ( mm 2 ) C a ll u s w i d t h ( mm ) 20 10 h Mg - IMN IMN X y l eno l / c a l c e i n ( i n t en s i t y r a t i o ) 2 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 X y l eno l / c a l c e i n ( i n t en s i t y r a t i o ) * * * 2 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 X y l eno l / c a l c e i n ( i n t en s i t y r a t i o ) 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 * f I M N M g – I M N Time ( weeks ) 2 4 8 12 C a r t il age f r a c t i on ( v e r s u s t o t a l c a ll u s ) Mg - IMN IMN 0 . 45 0 . 30 0 . 15 0 2 4 8 Time ( weeks ) 12 * c 350 300 250 ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 10 ) ( 8 ) ( 8 ) ( 6 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 8 ) ( 8 ) ( 10 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 10 ) ( 10 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 6 ) 200 150 100 2 4 8 12 Time ( weeks ) 2 4 8 12 Time ( weeks ) 2 4 4 8 12 12 Time ( weeks ) Time ( weeks ) Mg - IMN IMN T V ( mm 3 ) 120 100 80 60 BV ( mm 3 ) 0 . 7 0 . 6 0 . 5 0 . 4 0 . 3 BV / T V 600 500 400 300 200 B M D o f T V ( m g H A / c m 3 ) * * * * * * * * * * * d ( 9 ) ( 10 ) 120 M a x i m u m c o m p r e ss i v e l oad ( N ) 80 40 0 I M N M g - I M N * I M N M g – I M N e Time ( weeks ) 2 4 8 12 Time ( weeks ) Mg - IMN IMN 1 . 0 B one f r a c t i on ( v e r s u t o t a l c a ll u s ) 0 . 8 0 . 6 2 4 8 12 * Figure 5 Innovative magnesium - containing intramedullary nail accelerates fracture healing of femoral shaft in rats with ovariectomy - induced osteoporosis .

No difference in protein gene prod - uct 9 . 5 , a marker for mature nerves 38 , was found between the two groups from day 4 to day 14 ( Supplementary Fig . 8d ) . CGRP receptor mediates Mg - IMN - promoted bone - fracture healing To confirm the role of CGRP and its receptor in Mg - IMN - facilitated bone - fracture healing , we performed Ramp1 knockdown and overexpression in vivo , in conjunction with Mg - IMN implanta - tion . Radiographs ( Fig . 6a ) and safranin O staining ( Fig . 6b ) showed that Mg - IMN - facilitated bone - fracture healing was further enhanced by AdV - Ramp1 - induced overexpression and abrogated by AdV - sh Ramp1 - induced knockdown of Ramp1 , as compared to co - treatment with a control vector . In addition , aberrant fibrous tissue was found to be filling the fracture gaps in the femora with Ramp1 knockdown ( Fig . 6b ) . We also performed a four - point bending biomechanical test to determine the strength of the healing fracture in these different treatment groups . We found that the maximum compressive load was significantly lower in AdV - sh Ramp1 - treated , and higher in AdV - Ramp1 - treated femora , with Mg - IMN implantation , as compared to those treated with AdV - NC , at week 4 after surgery ( Fig . 6c ) . DISCUSSION Studies of humans and other species have suggested the poten - tial of magnesium - based alloys or BMG in the promotion of bone formation 3 , 10 , 12 , 39 – 42 , yet the underlying mechanism ( s ) for this ben - eficial effect remains unexplained . The present study has provided compelling evidence from findings both in vitro and in vivo for a con - tribution of magnesium to the robust promotion of bone formation and enhancement of fracture healing with the underlying mechanisms elucidated . To a great extent , the beneficial effects of magnesium are mediated by CGRP , a neuropeptide released from the sensory neuro - nal endings in the periosteum of the long - bone shaft . Although it has long been known that the central nervous system has an important role in the regulation of bone formation 43 , 44 , the exact role of sen - sory nerves in this process has remained elusive . Here a previously unrecognized CGRP - mediated cross - talk pathway between peripheral nerves and PDSCs has been identified as a major mechanism underly - ing magnesium - induced bone formation ( Fig . 6d ) . A few points from our findings support the involvement of CGRP sensory nerves in the beneficial effects of magnesium . First , magnesium - induced bone formation was largely reduced by destroy - ing the sensory nerves or by removal of the periosteum , where a large number of sensory nerves exist . Second , magnesium induced abundant expression of neuron - derived CGRP in the newly formed bone . Studies on DRG neuronal cultures suggest that such an effect of Mg 2 + on CGRP occurs through ( i ) MAGT1 - and TRPM7 - mediated Mg 2 + - entry into neurons and ( ii ) Mg 2 + - facilitated CGRP - vesicle aggregation at synapses , probably by promoting actin polymerization . Importantly , pharmacological inhibition of the CGRP receptor in vivo or the silencing of its related genes ( Calcrl or Ramp1 ) attenuated the new bone formation induced by magnesium implants ( magnesium rod or Mg - IMN ) , whereas overexpression of Calcrl or Ramp1 in vivo enhanced the beneficial effects of magnesium implants .

( d ) Schematic diagram showing diffusion of implant - derived Mg 2 + across the bone toward the periosteum that is innervated by DRG sensory neurons and enriched with PDSCs undergoing osteogenic differentiation into new bone ( top ) . Inset ( shown enlarged at bottom ) , the released Mg 2 + enters DRG neurons via Mg 2 + transporters or channels ( i . e . , MAGT1 and TRPM7 ) and promotes CGRP - vesicles accumulation and exocytosis . The DRG - released CGRP , in turn , activates the CGRP receptor ( consisting of CALCRL and RAMP1 ) in PDSCs , which triggers phosphorylation of CREB1 via cAMP and promotes the expression of genes contributing to osteogenic differentiation . n p g © 201 6 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . A r t i c l e s 1168 VOLUME 22 | NUMBER 10 | OCTOBER 2016 nAture medicine can also be co - expressed with RAMP2 to form a receptor for amylin , which is known to inhibit bone resorption 45 . However , gene manip - ulation of Calcrl or Ramp1 showed similar effects on Mg - induced bone formation , which suggests the involvement of CGRP instead of amylin . Moreover , in isolated PDSCs , the key cell type involved in osteogenesis 18 , 20 , CGRP promoted osteogenic differentiation through CGRP - receptor - coupled cAMP activation of CREB1 and SP7 , tran - scription factors essential to osteogenesis 35 , 46 , 47 . Of note , our results both in vitro and in vivo suggest that CGRP or magnesium implant only upregulates SP7 but not RUNX2 , another downstream target of CREB1 important for osteogenesis 34 , which suggests the specific activation of CREB1 and SP7 , leading to osteogenic differentiation ( Fig . 6d ) . Further study is required to understand why RUNX2 is not responsive to magnesium or CGRP and whether other reported CREB1 - regulated pathways ( for example , BMP2 , Wnt / β - catenin ) are involved 48 , 49 . Taken together , these results are consistent with previous findings showing that CGRP insufficiency , accompanied by magnesium loss in the bone , is associated with delayed fracture healing in aged animals 50 , 51 . Sensory nerves secrete CGRP and promote callus forma - tion and bone remodeling , whereas a lack of CGRP + nerve fibers leads to delayed union or nonunion 21 , 52 , 53 . Therefore , the presently identified role of magnesium in promoting CGRP - mediated osteogenesis has suggested its therapeutic implication in the repair of osteoporotic bone fracture or other bone diseases . Nevertheless , whether a magnesium implant or CGRP influences other cell types , such as chondrocytes , to contribute to osteogenesis awaits further investigation . It would also be important to test whether systemic administration of magnesium ( such as oral pills ) would promote CGRP mobilization and thus be a potential nutraceutical method for bone disorders . A progression of the present study would be the development of a Mg - IMN system to provide both mechanical support and osteogenic benefits for repairing long - bone fracture . It is known that closed - bone fracture is commonly seen in patients with osteoporosis , the so - called low - energy osteoporotic fractures . As a proof - of - concept experi - ment , we used a closed - fracture model where the injury is limited to the fractured bone , with no injury to the periosteum . In addition , Mg - IMN was implanted with the drilled holes adjacent to the fracture line , ensuring that the released Mg 2 + is delivered mostly to the wound . As expected , higher magnesium content was detected in peripheral fracture callus in the Mg - IMN group than in the IMN group . The way in which the released Mg 2 + is transported to the perio - steal region can be explained by the diameter of Mg 2 + ( < 300 pm ) being much smaller than that of Harversian’s or Volkmann’s canals within the cortical bone ( in microscale level ) , as reported in our earlier study 54 . In addition , Mg 2 + might diffuse through the fracture gaps ( Fig . 6d ) . The outcome seen here with Mg - IMN treatment is promising . First , Mg - IMN accelerated bone remodeling , as indicated by significant increases in callus , BV and the ratio of xylenol / calcein osteoid staining at an early stage ( week 4 ) . Second , mechanical strength is improved by Mg - IMN . At week 12 , although the xylenol / calcein staining ratio is lower in the Mg - IMN group than in the IMN group , probably owing to the completion of bone remodeling , a higher BMD and better lamellar bone morphology were achieved with Mg - IMN treatment , indicating greater mechanical strength than that achieved with IMN treatment . This result is also consistent with a previous report show - ing better alignment of matrix collagen in Mg 2 + - treated cells 55 . Of note , in the present study , new bone is formed mainly in the periosteal region , which , even with a small - scale increase in BV , might translate into substantial improvement in biomechanical properties ( that is , bending or torsional strength ) , as previously reported 56 , 57 . Indeed , biomechanical testing confirmed a much stronger mechanical prop - erty of the bone in the Mg - IMN group at the end of experimental time frame ( that is , at week 12 after implantation ) . In addition , the pain levels in rats with Mg - IMN treatment showed no difference relative to controls , which suggests the suitability of Mg - IMN for clinical uses . In conclusion , the present study has revealed a CGRP - involved mechanism that underlies the osteogenic effects of magnesium - based implant . An innovative Mg - IMN system has been developed and has shown therapeutic potential for bone injuries , in particular , for the com - monly seen low - energy osteoporotic fracture . With the development of specific cell or tissue targeting systems 58 , it might also be possible to deliver Mg 2 + or recombinant CGRP to specific healing sites in the bone . Therefore , the present findings could have broader implications in the treatment or prevention of other bone diseases or injuries , such as high - energy fractures resulting from sports injuries and other traumas .

All animal experimental protocols used in the present study were approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong . Sex - and age - matched animals were divided into groups randomly . No samples , rats or data points were excluded . Analyses were performed in a nonblinded fashion . Fabrication of magnesium rod . Ultrapure ( 99 . 99 % ) magnesium cylindrical rods ( 1 . 28 mm in diameter , 20 mm in length ) were provided by the Department of Materials Science and Engineering in Peking University ( China ) . The mag - nesium rods were prepared by copper - mold injection casting under argon atmosphere using published protocol 11 . In brief , magnesium was placed in a quartz tube and melted . Then the melted magnesium was injected quickly into a copper mold , and finally , rod samples were obtained . Differential scanning calorimetry ( Q100 , Thermal Analysis , USA ) was used to identify the thermal dynamic properties of the samples . Magnesium rods were sterilized by immers - ing into 70 % ethanol for 30 min before implantation . Intramedullary implantation in rat femur . Three - month - old female Sprague Dawley ( SD ) rats were used for surgical intramedullary implantation , as previ - ously reported 3 , 12 . After the rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with ketamine ( 75 mg / kg ) and xylazine ( 10 mg / kg ) , the right knee of the rat was exposed and a tunnel with a 1 . 2 - mm diameter and 30 mm in length was drilled from the patellofemoral groove of the distal femur along the axis of the femoral shaft . A sterilized magnesium or stainless steel rod was inserted into the femur canal . The wound was sutured , and the rats were housed in an environmentally controlled animal - care laboratory after surgery . Serial radiographs were used to scan the operated distal femora weekly , up to week 16 after operation , for both general inspection and analysis . In some animals , BIBN4096BS ( 300 µ g / kg body weight , Shanghai Haoyuan Chemexpress , Shanghai , China ) conjugated with indodicarbocyanine ( Cy5 ) was injected into the middle site of the right femoral shaft immediately after implantation and every other day for 2 weeks . m X - ray fluorescence ( m XRF ) measurements . µ XRF measurements were performed using the scanning X - ray microscope installed at beamline ID21 of the ESRF ( Grenoble , France ) 59 . The primary X - ray beam energy was set to 2 . 1 keV and focused down to a microprobe ( 0 . 5 × 0 . 8 µ m 2 ) . The flux was 2 . 6 × 10 9 photons / s . A first mirror made of Ni was used , which passes the primary energy ( E1 ) and the third harmonic ( E3 ) of E1 ( E3 / E1 intensity ratio , ~ 1 / 10 ) . XRF and scattered radiation were collected with an energy - dispersive silicon drift detector with an active area of 80 mm 2 ( XFlash 5100 , Bruker , Germany ) , subsequently normalized by the intensity of E1 . Acquisition time per point was 100 ms . The step width for collecting the XRF maps ( 25 adjacent lines with 5 µ m spacing ) was set to 5 µ m . The use of the dual - energy X - ray beam configuration allowed for high excitation of magnesium and calcium with the 2 . 1 keV and 6 . 3 keV energy part of the X - ray beam , respectively . To directly compare different measurements , magnesium - to - calcium ratio was calculated from the line scans performed from the bone - marrow cavity ( inside ) to the periosteum ( outside ) . Scanning electron microscopy – energy - dispersive spectroscopy . Specimens embedded in methylmethacrylate ( MMA ) were sliced and polished to 100 µ m in thickness for sputter coating . The elemental composition at the selected regions of interests was determined by scanning electron microscopy – energy - dispersive spectra ( HITACHI SU8010 ; Japan ) . Periosteum stripping . Under general anesthesia , the right thighs of 3 - month - old female SD rats were incised from the lateral side to expose the femur bone . The muscle tissue was bluntly dissected from periosteum . Full thickness of periosteum at the region of femoral mid - shaft was stripped using sharp forceps , with partial residual attached to the peripheral cortex of the cortical bone ( 1 / 5 of the circle ) . The right femur with periosteum strip - ping was implanted with intramedullary magnesium rods from the condyle of distal femur . Injection of MgCl 2 at lumbar spine . Under anesthesia , MgCl 2 ( 10 mM in 100 µ l H 2 O , daily , for 3 d ) or same amount of saline as control was injected into the intervertebral foramen at the right lumbar levels ( L3 – L5 ) of 3 - month - old female SD rats . At day 7 , calcein green ( 5 mg / kg , Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) was subcutaneously injected to label the newly formed bone . Another 7 d later , the right femora were collected and embedded for hard - tissue sectioning . Capsaicin - induced sensory denervation . Capsaicin ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) and vehicle solution ( composition of Tween - 80 , ethanol , saline , with volume ratio as 1 : 1 : 8 ) were freshly prepared before treatment . Capsaicin was sonicated in the vehicle solution until homogenously suspended . 3 - month - old female SD rats were injected subcutaneously at the lumbar levels ( L3 – L5 ) with a high dose of capsaicin on 3 consecutive days ( 30 mg / kg on day 1 , 50 mg / kg on day 2 and 70 mg / kg on day 3 ) , according to a previously reported protocol 22 . Then , at day 4 after capsaicin injections , the rats were randomly chosen for intramedullary implantation of the magnesium rod into the distal femur . Adenovirus - based knockdown and overexpression in vivo . shRNAs and full - length cDNA of rat Calcrl ( NM _ 012717 , encoding calcitonin receptor - like recep - tor ) and Ramp1 ( NM _ 031645 . 1 , encoding receptor activity - modifying protein 1 , the binding site for CGRP ) were designed according to a published protocol 60 . The shRNAs ( Supplementary Table 1 ) and cDNA were synthesized by Sangon Biological Engineering Technology and Services ( Shanghai , China ) . The plasmids of PDC316 - mCMV - EGFP - cDNA - Calcrl , PDC316 - mCMV - EGFP - cDNA - Ramp1 , PDC316 - mCMV - EGFP - shRNA - Calcrl , PDC316 - mCMV - EGFP - shRNA - Ramp1 and PDC316 - mCMV - EGFP - NC ( negative control ) were generated by BioWit Technologies ( Shenzhen , China ) . These plasmids were cloned into adenovirus vectors , and the viral - null vectors were propagated in human embryonic kidney 293 ( HEK293 , cat # : ATCC CRL - 1573 , negative for mycoplasma contamination ) cells . Viral titer was determined by using standard plaque assays on HEK293 cells . The titers were set to be 1 × 10 11 pfu / ml , respectively . 3 d before implanta - tion , rats were anesthetized , and a hole ( 0 . 5 - mm in diameter ) in the right proxi - mal femoral shaft was drilled for injection of the aforementioned adenoviruses ( 10 µ l , with 10 9 pfu ) into the bone - marrow cavity . The same amount of adenovirus was also injected into the surrounding periosteum . Imaging in vivo . To visualize the injected Cy5 - conjugated BIBN4096BS and fluorescent adenoviruses , 24 h after administration of these reagents , rats were anes - thetized and shaved before chemiluminescence images were taken by an IVIS200 imaging system ( Xenogen Imaging Technologies , Alameda , CA , USA ) 58 . Micro - CT analysis . For nonfracture samples , rat femora were collected and implants were carefully removed before micro - CT scanning ( µ CT40 , Scanco Medical , Brüttisellen , Switzerland ) , according to our established protocol 58 , 61 . The scan range was set to be 5 mm ( 300 slides ) for the middle shaft . The resolution was set at 16 µ m per voxel and 1024 × 1024 pixels . The region of interest ( ROI ) was selected from 2D images with a standardized threshold ( > 220 ) as mineralized tissue , according to the tuning . 3D reconstruction of the mineralized tissue was performed according to our established protocol 61 . A low - pass Gaussian filter ( Sigma = 1 . 2 , Support = 2 ) was used for 3D recon - struction . Quantitative analysis involved all 300 slides of the 2D images . Morphometric parameters included total TV , BV , BV / TV and ρ MOI . For fracture samples , Mg - IMN or IMN was removed carefully , and femoral samples were wrapped in wet gauze and fitted in the sample tube ( Ø 38 mm ) for micro - CT scanning ( µ CT40 , Scanco Medical , Brttisellen , Switzerland ) , as we previously reported 61 . In brief , the scan range was set as 10 mm ( 650 slides ) , and the fracture line was set in the middle site of this range . The resolution was set to be 16 µ m / voxel and 1024 × 1024 pixels . ROI was selected from 2D images with a standardized threshold ( > 165 ) as mineralized tissue . 3D reconstruction of the mineralized tissue was performed with a low - pass Gaussian filter ( Sigma = 1 . 2 , Support = 2 ) . Quantitative analysis included all 650 slides of 2D images . Histological and histomorphometric analysis . After micro - CT scanning , samples were decalcified in 15 % ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) for 10 weeks before they were embedded in paraffin , after dehydration in a series of ethanol and xylene . Sections with a thickness of 6 µ m were cut and subjected to H & E and safranin O staining for the evaluation of newly formed bone under light microscope ( ZEISS AxioPlan2 , Germany ) . Immunohistochemical and n p g © 201 6 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nAture medicine doi : 10 . 1038 / nm . 4162 immunofluorescence staining was used for determining the expression of CGRP . Rabbit polyclonal antibody to CGRP was purchased from Abcam ( ab47027 , working with a dilution of 1 : 200 ) . The sequential fluorescence labeling was used to evaluate new - bone for - mation rate or bone remodeling during fracture healing , as we previously reported 58 , 61 . Calcein green ( 5 mg / kg , Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) was subcutaneously injected into rat femora 7 d before xylenol orange ( 90 mg / kg , Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) was injected in the same way . Another 7 d afterwards , rats were sacrificed , and femora were collected and embedded in MMA without decalcification and sectioned into thick sections ( 200 µ m ) . The tissue sections were further ground and polished to 100 µ m for the evaluation of new - bone formation rate under a fluorescence microscope ( Leica Q500MC , Leica , Germany ) . To calculate the temporal change of new bone formation , 5 mm proximal and 5 mm distal to the fracture line was chosen as the ROI for quantification of new bone formation . The ratio of area labeled with xylenol orange to area labeled with calcein green was determined using ImageJ . Fracture callus was digitalized under light microscope ( Zeiss , Germany ) and then quantified by ImageJ for bone - tissue - area fraction and cartilage - tissue - area fraction . A polarized light microscope was also applied to analyze the collagen birefringence arrangement in decalcified sections . Detection of neuropeptides by ELISA . The femora of the rats with and without magnesium implantation were harvested , and the mid - shaft of 1 cm in length was prepared for ceramic morta , ground into mud before putting into 15 - ml plastic tubes . Pre - cool lysis buffer ( 1 ml , with 1M hydrochloric acid ) was added into the tube and put into the ice bath . After oscillation and homogenization for 1 h , the buffer was transferred into a 1 . 5 - ml tube and centrifuged at 12 , 000 rpm for 30 min . The supernatant was collected for BCA protein quantitative analysis , and 200 µ l of supernatant from each specimen was used for the quantitative detection of CGRP ( Elabscience Biotechnology , USA ) , substance P , neurokinin K and galanin ( LifeSpan Bioscience , USA ) by ELISA kit . The ELISA result was normalized by the concentration of total protein for each specimen . Detection of CGRP expression in dorsal root ganglions . The right DRGs at lumbar L4 of SD rats were isolated according to a published procedure 62 . Briefly , after the administration of an overdose of phenobarbital , laminectomy was performed to remove the vertebral canal roof and to expose DRGs and the spinal cord . The isolated L4 DRG was transferred into a tube with 10 ml of PBS ( containing 10 % penicillin - streptomycin - neomycin ( PSN ) , from Life Technologies ) without Ca 2 + / Mg 2 + . After fixation in 4 % formalin solution for 24 h , the DRGs were dehydrated in 30 % - sucrose solution . Cryosections ( 10 - µ m thick ) were prepared for immunofluorescence staining of CGRP ( Abcam , ab47027 , 1 : 200 ) . Primary culture of DRG neurons . We isolated sensory neurons from L3 – L5 DRGs by sequential digestion using papain , type I collagenase ( 1 mg / ml ) and 0 . 25 % trypsin solutions by following reported protocols 62 – 64 . Morphologically distinct phase - bright neurons ( 50 % ) and phase - dark glial cells ( 50 % ) were observed right after isolation . These isolated cells were re - suspended in F12 medium and plated on round - glass slices ( 2 . 5 cm in diameter ) coated with lam - inin ( 20 ng / ml , Life Technologies ) and poly - d - lysine hydrobromide ( 50 ng / ml , Life Technologies ) at a density of 5 , 000 cells / ml . 4 h after plating , the culture medium was replaced with F12 medium containing 10 % FBS , 1 % PSN , 20 ng / ml NGF ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) , 10 −5 M fluorodeoxyuridine ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) and 10 −5 M uridine ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) for another 72 h in incubation , before the large phase - bright DRG neurons were used for further tests . Detection of synaptic vesicles in DRG neurons . We used fluorescent dye FM1 - 43 ( N - ( 3 - triethylammoniumpropyl ) - 4 - ( 4 - ( dibutylamino ) styryl ) pyrid - inium dibromide ) ( Biotium , Hayward , USA ) to label and trace the change and movement of synaptic vesicles in live DRG neurons , as previously reported 65 . The isolated DRG neurons were seeded on cover glasses . On the experimen - tal day , the cells were washed twice with a high K + and Mg 2 + - free ( HKMF ) Margo’s solution containing ( in mM ) : 45 NaCl , 90 KCl , 2 . 5 CaCl 2 , 20 HEPES acid and 10 glucose , before incubation with FM1 - 43 ( 10 µ M ) in HKMF Margo’s at 37 °C for 15 min . Afterwards , cells were washed with Mg 2 + - free Margo’s solution containing ( in mM ) : 130 NaCl , 5 KCl , 2 . 5 CaCl 2 , 20 HEPES acid and 10 glu - cose , for three times before being transferred to a mini - chamber and mounted to a confocal microscope ( Zeiss , Germany ) . MgCl 2 ( 1 – 2 mM ) or NMDG - Cl ( 2 – 4 mM ) as a control was added to the Mg 2 + - free Margo’s bath in the presence or absence of cytochalasin B ( 20 µ M ) . Z - stack ( 0 . 8 – 1 µ m intervals ) confocal images of the DRG neurons were captured every 2 – 10 min . The Z - stack series was projected into a single image for each time - point capture by the software Exciter ( Carl Zesis , Germany ) , the fluorescence intensity of which was analyzed and quantified by the software ImageJ ( version 1 . 42q , NIH , USA ) . Measurement of intracellular Mg 2 + in DRG neurons . DRG neurons were seeded on cover glasses 72 h before the experiments . The cells were incubated in the Mg 2 + - free Margo’s solution supplemented with 2 µ M Mg - Fura2 ( Life Technologies , USA ) and 1 µ M Pluronic F - 127 ( Life Technologies , USA ) for 30 min before being washed with the Mg 2 + - free Margo’s solution and stabilized for another 30 min at room temperature . After the cells were transferred to a mini - chamber that was mounted to a microscope ( Nikon Eclipse Ti , Japan ) equipped with a CCD camera ( Spot Xplorer , USA ) and a Fluor 20X objective lens ( 0 . 75 NA , Nikon , Japan ) , Mg - Fura2 was excited at 340 nm and 380 nm , respectively . Fluorescence signals were moni - tored , and pictures were taken every 5 s by a microscope ( Nikon Eclipse Ti , Japan ) . The fluorescence ratio was measured by the software MetaFluor ( USA ) . ATP assay . ATP concentrations were determined using a luminescence ATP - detection assay system ( ATPLite , PerkinElmer , USA ) , according to the manufacturer’s guidelines . 2 , 5 - fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) staining for confocal imaging . FITC - stained samples were prepared according to our established protocol 66 . In brief , rat femora were fixed and dehydrated and then 1 % FITC ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA , cat . # F7250 ) in 100 % ethanol was used to immerse the samples overnight . The samples were further dehydrated with 100 % ethanol and acetone , followed by plastic embedding and sectioning . The SP5 Leica confocal microscope was used to gather stackable images . Isolation and culture of rat PDSCs . Femora of 1 - month - old female rats were collected , and periosteum from mid - shaft to distal femur was collected and put into Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % FBS and type I collagenase ( 1 mg / ml ) . The periosteum was digested in a 37 °C incubator for another 8 h , and the filtered medium was centrifuged ( 1 , 000 g for 5 min ) to collect the periosteal cells . The mixed cells were plated at an optimal low - cell density ( 1 , 000 cells / cm 2 ) in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 to form colonies . At day 2 after initial plating , the cells were washed twice with PBS to remove nonadherent cells . At days 7 – 10 , large round colonies ( > 200 cells ) were trypsinized and mixed together as passage 1 . The collected cells were subcultured after reaching 80 – 90 % confluence . Cells at passage 3 – 5 were used for further experiments . Fluorescence staining for stem cell markers . PDSCs were seeded on glass slides at a density of 10 , 000 cells / slide and cultured for 24 h . After the cells were fixed and blocked with 5 % BSA solution for 1 h , the monoclonal rabbit anti - rat pri - mary antibody to CD44 ( Abcam , ab24504 ) , CD90 ( Abcam , ab92574 ) and CD105 ( Abcam , ab107095 ) were incubated with cells with a dilution of 1 : 500 ( v / v ) at 4 °C overnight . After washing with PBS twice , Cy5 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody with a dilution of 1 : 1 , 000 was applied to the slides for 1 h . The cells were washed in PBS , counterstained with DAPI and examined by a fluorescence microscope ( Leica Q500MC , Leica , Germany ) . Cell proliferation assay . PDSCs or MC3T3 - E1 clone 4 cell line ( ATCC CRL - 2593 , negative for mycoplasma contamination ) were plated at a density of 4 , 000 cells / cm 2 in a 96 - well plate and incubated in a 37 °C incubator with supple - mentation of 5 % CO 2 . Cell proliferation was assessed using MTT assay ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) at days 1 , 2 and 3 . The absorbance at 570 nm was measured and reported 67 . 10 −16 to 10 −8 M CGRP ( Abcam , USA , cat . # ab47101 ) was used . Real - time PCR . PDSCs were plated at a density of 4 , 000 cells / cm 2 in a 12 - well plate and cultured in basal culture medium until 90 % confluence . High - glucose n p g © 201 6 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nAture medicine doi : 10 . 1038 / nm . 4162 DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS , 1 nM dexamethasone , 50 µ M ascorbic acid , and 20 mM β - glycerolphosphate ( the last three chemicals were from Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) was used as osteogenic induction medium . At day 14 after osteogenic induction , PDSCs were harvested and homogenized for RNA extraction using the RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen , Germany ) 58 . Total mRNA was reverse - transcribed to cDNA using the First Strand cDNA kit ( Takara , DaLian , China ) . Then , 1 µ l of total cDNA of each sample was amplified in a 10 - µ l reaction system ( for 384 - well plate ) containing the SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix - UDG and specific primers ( Supplementary Table 2 ) for Opn , Bglap , Alp and Actb using the ABI 7900HT real - time PCR system ( Applied Biosystems , USA ) . The expression of the target gene was normalized to that of Actb . Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2 − ∆ CT formula . Alizarin red and ALP staining assay . PDSCs were plated at 4 , 000 cells / cm 2 in a 12 - well plate and cultured in complete medium until confluence . At day 14 after osteogenic induction , the cells were fixed for AR and ALP staining ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) and subsequent imaging evaluation using HP Scanjet G3110 Photo Scanner , as described previously 67 . Western blotting . Specific primary antibodies against CALCRL ( Abcam , ab83697 ) , RAMP1 ( Abcam , ab203282 ) , RUNX2 ( Abcam , ab76956 ) , SP7 ( Abcam , ab94744 ) , pCREB1 ( Abcam , ab32096 ) and β - actin ( Abcam , ab8227 ) were diluted to 1 : 1 , 000 ( v / v ) in blocking buffer for incubation of the membranes overnight , respectively . After incubating with HRP - labeled secondary antibodies against the species of primary antibodies under a dilution of 1 : 8 , 000 ( v / v ) for 1 h at room temperature , HRP signals were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit ( Amersham Biosciences , USA ) . Conditioned medium from the DRG neurons . Isolated DRG neurons were seeded onto 6 - well plates at a density of 10 , 000 cells / cm 2 . Once fully attached , DRG neurons were cultured in growth medium ( containing 1 mM of Mg 2 + ) supplemented with additional MgCl 2 ( 1 mM ) or NaCl ( 2 mM ) as a control for 72 h , after which 2 ml of medium from each well was collected and concentrated by a column ( Millipore ) into a final volume of 100 µ l . The concentrates were diluted at 1 : 100 with osteogenic induction medium and used for osteogenic differentiation of PDSCs . Design of the magnesium - containing intramedullary nail ( Mg - IMN ) . Hollow spinal needles ( 18 G , with an outer diameter of 1 . 27 mm and an inner diameter of 0 . 9 mm ) were purchased from Terumo ( Terumo , USA ) . Holes were drilled by electric sparks burning in vertical directions at the transverse section with an equal distance of 0 . 5 mm by Ziyoujian ( Shenzhen , China ) . Afterward , an ultrapure magnesium rod was inserted into the needles . In the finite elemental analysis ( FEA ) analysis , 10 - node tetrahedron element , SOLID 92 , was chosen to mesh the needle in ANSYS ( ANSYS , Canonsburgh , PA , USA ) . The size of the mesh element was 0 . 05 mm . The mechanical properties of the needle ( modulus as 210 GPa , poison ratio as 0 . 3 ) were input into the software . A parallel vertical force of 20 N at each loading point was applied downwardly to the needle . Establishment of closed - fracture model in osteoporotic rats . 6 - month - old female rats were used to establish standard ovariectomy - induced osteoporosis model , according to our well - established protocols 1 , 68 . Closed femoral fracture was established on the right femur of rat , according to our published protocol 1 . The rats were randomly divided into Mg - IMN and IMN groups . Mg - IMN or IMN was inserted into the fractured femur along its vertical axis from the patel - lofemoral groove to the greater trochanter . Analgesia was given every day for 3 d after surgery for pain relief . Measurement of nerve sprouting . Primary antibodies for GAP - 43 ( Abcam , ab16053 , 1 : 1 , 000 ) and PGP - 9 . 5 ( Abcam , ab8189 , 1 : 1 , 000 ) were purchased from Abcam . At day 4 , day 7 and day 14 after fixation , bone specimens 5 mm above and below the fracture line were collected for protein extraction and measurement of GAP - 43 and PGP9 . 5 expression by western blotting , as described above . Radiographic analysis of fracture callus . The radiographs were analyzed according to our established protocol 61 . Radiographic healing was defined as complete bridging of the mineralized callus . Callus width ( CW ) was defined as the maximum width of callus , and callus area ( CA ) was equal to the size of radiopaque area of callus as shown in the radiographs . Both CW and CA were measured on a lateral radiograph of each rat by using ImageJ . The measure - ment for each callus was repeated three times , and the average was used for statistical analysis . Biomechanical test . Four - point bending test was performed for evaluating the fracture - healing quality using a mechanical testing machine ( H25KS Hounsfield Test Equipment , Redhill , Surrey , UK ) , as described in our previous study 61 . In brief , the femora were placed with the anterior – posterior direction on the lower supporting bars at 26 mm apart , and the upper bars at 10 mm apart , flanking the fracture callus . A compression load was applied at a compression speed of 5 mm / min until failure . The maximum compressive load was derived from the load - deformation curve in built - in QMAT software ( Redhill , Surrey , UK ) . Gait analysis for pain measurement . Automated gait analysis was performed before surgery as a baseline , 1 week and 2 weeks after surgery , using a CatWalk system ( Noldus , Wageningen , Netherlands ) , as previously described 36 , 37 . Briefly , we trained the rats to cross the CatWalk walkway daily for 2 d before the implan - tation of magnesium or stainless steel . After setting the thresholds to pick up the illuminated contact prints , each rat was placed individually in the CatWalk walkway . The rats were allowed to walk freely . Video recording of paw prints was automatically triggered when the rats entered the ROI . Recorded runs with a steady walking speed ( variation , < 30 % ) were accepted as compliant runs for paw - print auto - classification as left forelimb ( LF ) , right forelimb ( RF ) , left hind limb ( LH ) and right hind limb ( RH ) by the built - in software . After checking the correctness of classification manually , we only further analyzed the runs with normal alternate footfall pattern ( LF → RH → RF → LH ) . Limb idleness index , another parameter for the assessment of pain 36 , was calculated from the raw data . Animals for pain test were not given analgesia . Statistical analysis . Sample size was based on preliminary data as well as on observed effect sizes . Data are presented as means ± s . e . m . , with n as the number of tissue preparations , cells or animals . Unpaired or paired two - tailed Student’s t test was used for comparison between two groups . Data distribu - tion was previously tested with the Shapiro – Wilk test . One - way or two - way ANOVA with relevant post hoc tests was used for multiple - group comparisons . Box - and - whisker plots were used to describe the entire population without assumptions about the statistical distribution . P < 0 . 05 was considered to be statistically significant . GraphPad Prism software ( Version 6 . 01 ) was used for above statistical analysis . 59 . Salomé , M . et al . The ID21 scanning X - ray microscope at ESRF . J . Phys . Conf .
