Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 53 ( 2001 ) 123 – 130 www . elsevier . com / locate / drugdeliv Combinatorial chemistry and biomedical polymer development S . Brocchini Biomedical Polymers Group , Department of Pharmaceutics , School of Pharmacy , University of London , 29 Brunswick Square , London WC 1 N 1 AX , UK Abstract Polymers are ubiquitous components of products manufactured for medical and pharmaceutical applications . Widely used commodity polymers were the ﬁrst polymers to be utilised in biomedical applications . These polymers were not developed with biocompatibility established at the onset and many speciality polymers have been developed in recent years to begin to meet the multifaceted demands for medical development , the optimisation of structure – property correlations and ultimately , clinical use . In the broader area of materials research , combinatorial or high throughput strategies used for drug development are recognised to have potential for discovery and process development . Much of the application of combinatorial chemistry in drugs research has been dependent on the use of polymeric reagents , substrates and supports . The chemistry of the reactions on polymers in solid and liquid phases have also played a major role in combinatorial drugs research . There is considerable interest in combinatorial materials research and this review outlines how this research may be applied for biomedical polymer development . (cid:211) 2001 Elsevier Science B .
