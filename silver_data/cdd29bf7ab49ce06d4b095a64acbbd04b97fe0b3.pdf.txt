Regulation of actin filament dynamics is one of the essential processes of myofibril assembly , but the mechanism of actin regulation in striated muscle is not clearly understood . Actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin is a key enhancer of actin filament dynamics in striated muscle in both vertebrates and nematodes . Here , we report that CAS - 1 , a cyclase - associated protein in Caenorhabditis elegans , promotes ADF / cofilin - dependent actin filament turnover in vitro and is required for sarcomeric actin organization in striated muscle . CAS - 1 is predominantly expressed in striated muscle from embryos to adults . In vitro , CAS - 1 binds to actin monomers and enhances exchange of actin - bound ATP / ADP even in the presence of UNC - 60B , a muscle - specific ADF / cofilin that inhibits the nucleotide exchange . As a result , CAS - 1 and UNC - 60B cooperatively enhance actin filament turnover . The two proteins also cooperate to shorten actin filaments . A cas - 1 mutation is homozygous lethal with defects in sarcomeric actin organization . cas - 1 - mutant embryos and worms have aggregates of actin in muscle cells , and UNC - 60B is mislocalized to the aggregates . These results provide genetic and biochemical evidence that cyclase - associated protein is a critical regulator of sarcomeric actin organization in striated muscle . Key words : Actin turnover , ADF / cofilin , Cyclase - associated protein , Myofibril , Muscle Introduction In striated muscle , actin filaments are organized in sarcomeric structures in which length and polarity of the filaments are highly ordered , so that coordinated actin – myosin interaction can efficiently produce contractile forces ( Clark et al . , 2002 ) . Assembly and maintenance of sarcomeric actin filaments require specific mechanisms for controlling actin dynamics , which is different from highly dynamic actin - regulatory systems in non - muscle cells ( Ono , 2010 ) . However , the mechanism by which turnover of sarcomeric actin filaments is enhanced or suppressed is not clearly understood . Actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin is an essential factor in striated muscle for enhancing actin filament dynamics ( Ono , 2007 ; Ono , 2010 ) . In mammalian striated muscle , cofilin - 2 , a muscle - specific ADF / cofilin , is predominantly expressed ( Ono et al . , 1994 ; Thirion et al . , 2001 ; Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ) , and a mutation in human cofilin - 2 causes nemaline myopathy ( Agrawal et al . , 2007 ) . Knockdown of cofilin in cultured rat cardiomyocytes causes disorganization of myofibrils ( Skwarek - Maruszewska et al . , 2009 ) . In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , UNC - 60B , a muscle - specific ADF / cofilin , is required for proper assembly of sarcomeric actin filaments in striated muscle ( Ono et al . , 2003 ; Ono et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , ADF / cofilin is a conserved enhancer of actin filament dynamics in striated muscle and functions together with other actin regulators for proper assembly and maintenance of sarcomeric actin organization . Although ADF / cofilin by itself can enhance actin filament turnover by filament severing ( Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ; Ichetovkin et al . , 2000 ; Pavlov et al . , 2007 ) and monomer dissociation from the pointed ends ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Maciver et al . , 1998 ) , the effect of ADF / cofilin can be enhanced or suppressed by other factors ( Van Troys et al . , 2008 ) . Studies in C . elegans striated muscle show that tropomyosin ( LEV - 11 ) ( Ono and Ono , 2002 ; Yu and Ono , 2006 ) and UNC - 87 , a calponin - like protein ( Yamashiro et al . , 2007 ) , protect actin filaments from severing by ADF / cofilin , while actin - interacting protein 1 ( AIP1 ) enhances disassembly of ADF / cofilin - bound actin filaments ( Mohri et al . , 2006 ; Mohri and Ono , 2003 ; Ono , 2001 ; Ono et al . , 2011 ) . Tropomodulin ( UNC - 94 / TMD - 1 ) caps the pointed ends of actin filaments and protects them from ADF / cofilin - mediated depolymerization ( Yamashiro et al . , 2008 ) . In vertebrate striated muscle , actin filaments are stabilized by tropomyosin ( Mudry et al . , 2003 ) , tropomodulin ( Littlefield et al . , 2001 ) , and nebulin ( Pappas et al . , 2010 ) . Although functional relationships between these proteins and ADF / cofilin have not been determined in vertebrates , the regulatory mechanism of actin filament stability is expected to be similar in vertebrates and nematodes . Cyclase - associated protein ( CAP ) is an enhancer of ADF / cofilin - dependent actin turnover , which has been characterized mostly in non - muscle cells . Vertebrates have two CAP isoforms , CAP1 and CAP2 ( Yu et al . , 1994 ) , and CAP2 is predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle ( Bertling et al . , 2004 ; Peche et al . , 2007 ; Wolanski et al . , 2009 ) . However , the function of CAP2 in striated muscle is not clearly understood . CAP ( also known as Srv2 ) was originally identified in yeast as a component Research Article 4077 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e of the Ras – cAMP signaling ( Fedor - Chaiken et al . , 1990 ; Field et al . , 1990 ) and has been shown to bind to actin monomers ( Freeman et al . , 1995 ) . Homologs of CAP have been subsequently found in other eukaryotes , and their activities to regulate actin cytoskeleton are conserved ( Hubberstey and Mottillo , 2002 ) . Biochemical studies by Moriyama and Yahara showed that human CAP1 enhances actin filament turnover in vitro in the presence of ADF / cofilin by promoting dissociation of ADF / cofilin from actin monomers and enhancing exchange of actin - bound ATP / ADP ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ) . These activities are consistent with the cooperative roles of CAP and ADF / cofilin in the regulation of actin dynamics in yeast ( Balcer et al . , 2003 ) and mammalian cultured cells ( Bertling et al . , 2004 ) . A similar function was previously proposed for profilin ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1998 ; Didry et al . , 1998 ) . However , relatively high concentrations of profilin are required to enhance actin dynamics because it preferentially binds to ATP – G - actin rather than ADP – G - actin , which is the predominant form of ADF / cofilin - bound actin monomers . In contrast , yeast CAP preferentially binds to ADP – G - actin ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) and efficiently enhances actin turnover at low concentrations in the presence of ADF / cofilin ( Chaudhry et al . , 2007 ; Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ) . The C . elegans genome has two genes that encode CAP homologs , but their functions have not been characterized . In C . elegans muscle , mutations in profilins cause only minor phenotypes in sarcomeric actin organization ( Polet et al . , 2006 ) , and they do not appear to cooperate strongly with ADF / cofilin in vivo ( Yamashiro et al . , 2008 ) . These observations led us to hypothesize that CAP is involved in ADF / cofilin - dependent actin dynamics in C . elegans muscle . We found that one of the C . elegans CAP genes , cas - 1 , is expressed in striated muscle and required for viability and sarcomeric actin organization , providing genetic evidence that CAP is an essential factor for myofibril assembly in striated muscle . Results CAS - 1 is expressed in the body wall muscle and localizes to the M - lines cah - 1 was previously reported as a gene that encodes a homolog of cyclase - associated protein ( CAP ) , which is adjacent to mec - 4 on the X chromosome ( Lai et al . , 1996 ) . Later , this gene was renamed as cas - 1 ( cyclase - associated protein - 1 ) because the gene name ‘ cah ’ was suited better to represent the carbonic anhydrase gene family . As a result , currently known cah - 1 is a gene that encodes a carbonic anhydrase ( Fasseas et al . , 2011 ) and unrelated to cas - 1 , which is the major subject of the current study . Although ‘CAP’ is the common name for this protein family , the gene name ‘ cap ’ has already been used for designation of C . elegans genes encoding heterodimeric actin capping protein subunits ( cap - 1 and cap - 2 ) ( Waddle et al . , 1993 ) . The amino acid sequence of CAS - 1 has a conserved domain structure ( supplementary material Fig . S1A ) and shows 32 – 41 % identity with CAPs in other organisms . In particular , sequence identity of CAS - 1 with human CAP1 , human CAP2 , and yeast Srv2 / CAP is 37 , 38 and 32 % , respectively . The C . elegans genome sequencing project identified a second CAP gene with 41 % identity with CAS - 1 , and we designated this gene as cas - 2 . Functional analysis of cas - 2 is currently in progress and will be reported elsewhere . Vertebrates have two CAP isoforms : CAP1 ( a non - muscle isoform ) and CAP2 ( a muscle isoform ) ( Yu et al . , 1994 ) ( supplementary material Fig . S1B ) . However , phylogenetic analysis of CAP sequences suggested that the two C . elegans isoforms have evolved separately from vertebrate isoforms ( supplementary material Fig . S1B ) . Prediction of secondary structures of CAS - 1 by Jpred 3 ( Cole et al . , 2008 ) indicated that the N - terminal region ( residues 3 – 231 ) is enriched in a - helices , and that the C - terminal region ( residues 342 – 492 ) is primarily composed of b - strands ( supplementary material Fig . S1A ) . These are consistent with known structures of the N - terminal helical folded domain ( HFD ) of Dictyostelium CAP ( Ksiazek et al . , 2003 ; Mavoungou et al . , 2004 ; Yusof et al . , 2005 ) and the C - terminal b - sheet domain of yeast Srv2 / CAP and human CAP1 ( Dodatko et al . , 2004 ) . However , alignment of the N - terminal sequences shows that C . elegans CAS - 1 as well as human CAP1 and CAP2 contain gaps as compared with yeast Srv2 / CAP ( supplementary material Fig . S1C ) . This region of yeast Srv2 / CAP is predicted to form a coiled coil ( Nishida et al . , 1998 ) , but this feature may not be conserved in C . elegans CAS - 1 ( see Discussion ) . The central region of C . elegans CAS - 1 has a proline - rich region ( P1 ) and a WASP - homology 2 ( WH2 ) domain ( supplementary material Fig . S1A , D ) . P1 of yeast Srv2 / CAP is known to bind to profilin ( Bertling et al . , 2007 ) . However , CAS - 1 lacks a second proline - rich region ( P2 ) , which is present in yeast Srv2 / CAP ( supplementary material Fig . S1D ) . Proline residues are present in this region of CAS - 1 , but they are scattered and not clustered as they are in yeast Srv2 / CAP ( supplementary material Fig . S1D ) . Human CAP - 1 and CAP - 2 also have scattered prolines in this region ( supplementary material Fig . S1D ) . Thus , C . elegans CAS - 1 shows greater similarity to mammalian CAPs than yeast Srv2 / CAP . Since there was no functional information on cas - 1 , we first determined expression patterns of cas - 1 in C . elegans . A promoter – reporter analysis using a 3 - kb - upstream sequence as a promoter and green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) as a reporter resulted in no detectable GFP expression , suggesting that another genetic element is required for expression of cas - 1 ( K . O . , D . L . Baillie and S . O . , unpublished observations ) . Therefore , we generated antibody against the CAS - 1 protein and determined localization patterns of CAS - 1 by immunofluorescence microscopy . The antibody was raised in rabbits using a C - terminal fragment of CAS - 1 ( residues 225 – 495 ) as an immunogen . On western blots , affinity - purified anti - CAS - 1 antibody reacted specifically with a band corresponding to the size of CAS - 1 in whole worm lysates ( supplementary material Fig . S2 , lane 13 ) and with purified recombinant full - length CAS - 1 protein and the C - terminal fragment of CAS - 1 ( supplementary material Fig . S2 , lanes 9 and 11 ) , but it did not react with CAS - 2 , a second CAP isoform in C . elegans ( supplementary material Fig . S2 , lanes 8 and 12 ) . In embryos , CAS - 1 was specifically expressed in the body wall muscle as early as the 1 . 5 - fold stage ( , 420 min old ; Fig . 1A ) . MYO - 3 is a muscle - specific myosin heavy chain and used as a marker for embryonic body wall muscle ( Fig . 1A ) . At this stage , MYO - 3 was not completely assembled into myofibrils ( Fig . 1A ) , indicating that this is an early stage of myofibril assembly . Nonetheless , CAS - 1 was concentrated to a region where MYO - 3 had been assembled into myofibrils ( Fig . 1A ) . At the twofold stage ( , 450 min old ) , CAS - 1 remained associated with well - organized myofibrils ( Fig . 1B ) , as indicated by the linear arrangement of MYO - 3 ( Fig . 1B ) . Throughout the embryonic stages , expression of CAS - 1 was specific in the body wall muscle , and no other embryonic tissues expressed detectable levels of CAS - 1 ( Fig . 1A , B ) . Journal of Cell Science 125 ( 17 ) 4078 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e In adult worms , CAS - 1 was expressed in the body wall muscle ( Fig . 1C ) , the pharynx ( Fig . 1D ) , the neurons ( Fig . 1D ) , the intestine ( Fig . 1E ) , and the spermatheca ( Fig . 1F ) . In the adult body wall muscle , CAS - 1 localized in a striated pattern indicating that it was associated with sarcomeres ( Fig . 1C ) . Interestingly , CAS - 1 only partially overlapped with bands of actin ( Fig . 1G , arrows ) . Instead , strong striated staining of CAS - 1 overlapped with MYO - 3 ( Fig . 1H , arrowheads ) that is enriched in the M - lines within the thick filaments ( Miller et al . , 1983 ) . We confirmed the enrichment of CAS - 1 in the M - line by colocalization with UNC - 89 ( Fig . 1I , arrowheads ) , a specific marker of the M - lines ( Benian et al . , 1996 ) . Relatively weakly stained spots of CAS - 1 were present ( Fig . 1G , J , K , arrows ) , but these did not colocalize with vinculin ( Fig . 1J ) or a - actinin ( Fig . 1K ) , indicating that CAS - 1 did not localize to dense bodies , which are equivalent to the Z - discs in mammalian striated muscle . It should be noted that mammalian CAP2 also localizes to the M - line in human skeletal muscle ( Peche et al . , 2007 ) , suggesting that the M - line localization is a common feature of CAP in striated muscle across different species .

C . elegans cyclase - associated protein 4079 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e CAS - 1 promotes actin filament turnover in the presence of ADF / cofilin in vitro We produced recombinant CAS - 1 proteins and characterized their biochemical properties . Biochemical studies on yeast Srv2 / CAP ( Balcer et al . , 2003 ; Mattila et al . , 2004 ) and human CAP1 ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ) have shown that the N - terminal and C - terminal halves of CAPs have distinct functions . Therefore , we produced full - length CAS - 1 ( residues 1 – 495 ) as well as the N - terminal half ( CAS - 1N ; residues 1 – 224 ) containing the putative helical - folded domain and the C - terminal half ( CAS - 1C ; residues 225 – 495 ) containing the proline - rich sequence , the WH2 domain , and the putative G - actin - binding domain ( supplementary material Fig . S1A ) . We used a maltose - binding - protein ( MBP ) fusion system that is reported to enhance solubility and proper folding of recombinant proteins ( Fox and Waugh , 2003 ) . The MBP fusion system significantly improved solubility of the CAS - 1 protein in Escherichia coli , and we were successful in purifying full - length CAS - 1 , CAS - 1N and CAS - 1C as MBP fusion proteins ( supplementary material Fig . S2 , lanes 2 – 4 ) . Cleavage of MBP by TEV protease was very inefficient . Therefore , we used MBP fusion proteins in the following experiments and included purified MBP ( supplementary material Fig . S2 , lane 1 ) in control experiments . We tested whether the CAS - 1 protein binds to G - actin as reported for CAP proteins from other organisms using three methods . First , we examined effects of MBP – CAS - 1 , MBP – CAS - 1N and MBP – CAS - 1C on spontaneous actin polymerization from G - actin ( Fig . 2A – D ) . MBP – CAS - 1 ( full - length ) slowed down the initial phase of actin polymerization in a concentration - dependent manner ( Fig . 2A , D ) , indicating that CAS - 1 bound to G - actin and inhibited actin nucleation . MBP – CAS - 1C had a similar inhibitory effect on actin polymerization to full - length CAS - 1 ( Fig . 2C , D ) . However , MBP – CAS - 1N moderately slowed down polymerization only when CAS - 1N was present at a high concentration ( 15 m M CAS - 1N to 5 m M actin ; Fig . 2B , D ) . MBP alone had no effect on the rate of actin polymerization at 15 m M ( Fig . 2D , black circle ) . These results indicate that the N - terminal and C - terminal halves of CAS - 1 independently bind to G - actin , and that the C - terminal half binds to G - actin more strongly than the N - terminal half . However , at the steady state , full - length CAS - 1 sequestered actin monomers , but either CAS - 1N or CAS - 1C was not effective in sequestering actin monomers . Various concentrations of actin monomers were polymerized in the presence of 2 or 5 m M MBP , MBP – CAS - 1 , MBP – CAS - 1N or MBP – CAS - 1C , and the amounts of polymerized actin were quantified ( Fig . 2E – H ) . MBP or MBP – CAS - 1N did not affect actin polymerization ( Fig . 2E , G ) . MBP – CAS - 1 shifted the critical concentration from 0 . 13 m M by actin alone to 0 . 55 and 1 . 0 m M in the presence of 2 and 5 m M MBP – CAS - 1 , respectively ( Fig . 2F ) . From these values , dissociation constant for binding of MBP – CAS - 1 to actin was estimated as 1 . 4 m M ( 2 m M MBP – CAS - 1 ) and 0 . 62 m M ( 5 m M MBP – CAS - 1 ) . Interestingly , although MBP – CAS - 1C had a strong inhibitory effect on the initial phase of actin polymerization ( Fig . 2C ) , it shifted the critical concentration only weakly to 0 . 20 and 0 . 27 m M in the presence of 2 and 5 m M MBP – CAS - 1C , respectively ( Fig . 2H ) . From these values , dissociation constant for binding of MBP – CAS - 1 to actin was estimated as 9 . 2 m M ( 2 m M MBP – CAS - 1C ) and 4 . 5 m M ( 5 m M MBP – CAS - 1C ) . These suggest that CAS - 1C is sufficient to Fig . 2 . Effects of CAS - 1 on actin polymerization . ( A – D ) Effects of CAS - 1 on the initial phase of actin polymerization . G - actin ( 5 m M , 20 % pyrene labeled ) was polymerized by addition of salt at time 0 in the presence of 0 – 15 m M MBP – CAS - 1 ( A ) , MBP – CAS - 1N ( B ) or MBP – CAS - 1C ( C ) , and intensity of the pyrene fluorescence ( arbitrary units ; AU ) was monitored over time . ( D ) Relative rates of actin polymerization in the presence of MBP – CAS - 1 ( white circles ) , MBP – CAS - 1N ( white triangles ) , MBP – CAS - 1C ( white squares ) , and MBP ( black circle ) were determined as described in Materials and Methods . Data are means 6 s . d . of three independent experiments . ( E – H ) Effects of CAS - 1 on the steady state of actin polymerization . Varying concentrations of actin ( 20 % pyrene labeled ) were polymerized in the presence of 0 – 5 m M MBP ( E ) , MBP – CAS - 1 ( F ) , MBP – CAS - 1N ( G ) or MBP – CAS - 1C ( H ) for 18 hr , and the intensity of the pyrene fluorescence ( arbitrary units ) was measured .

Second , we tested G - actin binding of CAS - 1 by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( PAGE ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Under nondenaturing conditions , G - actin alone migrated in a major band ( Fig . 3A – D , lane 1 ) . As a control , increasing concentrations of MBP did not affect the mobility of the G - actin band when MBP and G - actin were mixed ( Fig . 3A , lanes 8 – 11 ) , indicating that MBP did not interact with G - actin . However , in mixtures of G - actin and MBP – CAS - 1 , the G - actin band was gradually Fig . 3 . Binding of CAS - 1 to G - actin and the UNC - 60B – actin complex , examined by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . Various concentrations ( 1 – 10 m M ) of MBP ( A ) , MBP – CAS - 1 ( B ) , MBP – CAS - 1N ( C ) or MBP – CAS - 1C ( D ) were incubated with buffer only ( lanes 4 – 7 ) or buffer with 10 m M G - actin ( lanes 8 – 11 ) or 10 m M G - actin and 10 m M UNC - 60B ( lanes 12 – 15 ) and examined by nondenaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis . G - actin alone ( lane 1 ) , UNC - 60B alone ( lane 2 ) , and mixtures of G - actin and UNC - 60B ( lane 3 ) were also applied to determine positions of free G - actin , free UNC - 60B and the actin – UNC - 60B complex ( asterisks ) . C . elegans cyclase - associated protein 4081 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e diminished as the concentration of MBP – CAS - 1 was increased ( Fig . 3B , lanes 8 – 11 ) , indicating that the G - actin band was shifted due to its binding with MBP – CAS - 1 . Similar band shift of G - actin was observed in the presence of MBP – CAS - 1N ( Fig . 3C , lanes 8 – 11 ) or MBP – CAS - 1C ( Fig . 3D , lanes 8 – 11 ) . Thus , these results also indicate that the N - terminal and C - terminal halves of CAS - 1 independently bind to G - actin . Nondenaturing PAGE also allowed us to determine whether CAS - 1 interacts with UNC - 60B – actin complex . UNC - 60B alone migrated much slower than G - actin ( Fig . 3A – D , lane 2 ) , and the UNC - 60B – G - actin complex appeared above the G - actin band ( Fig . 3A – D , lane 3 , asterisks ) . MBP did not affect the band of the UNC - 60B – G - actin complex ( Fig . 3A , lanes 12 – 15 ) , while it was gradually diminished as increasing concentrations of MBP – CAS - 1 was added ( Fig . 3B , lanes 12 – 15 , asterisk ) indicating that CAS - 1 bound to the UNC - 60B – G - actin complex or that CAS - 1 promoted dissociation of UNC - 60B from G - actin . MBP – CAS - 1N similarly reduced the band of the UNC - 60B – G - actin complex ( Fig . 3C , lanes 12 – 15 , asterisk ) , whereas MBP – CAS - 1C did not affect the mobility of the band of the UNC - 60B – G - actin complex ( Fig . 3D , lanes 12 – 15 , asterisk ) . These results show that the N - terminal half of CAS - 1 is necessary and sufficient for interacting with the UNC - 60B – G - actin complex . Since nondenaturing PAGE was performed under low ionic conditions , we also tested binding of CAS - 1 with actin and UNC - 60B under physiological ionic conditions by pull - down assays in Fig . 4 . Effects of CAS - 1 on exchange of actin - bound nucleotides in the absence and presence of UNC - 60B . ATP – G - actin ( 1 m M ) was incubated with etheno – ATP in the presence of 0 – 0 . 5 m M MBP – CAS - 1 ( A , B ) , MBP – CAS - 1N ( C , D ) , or MBP – CAS - 1C ( E , F ) without UNC - 60B ( A , C , E ) or with 1 m M UNC - 60B ( B , D , F ) , and the fluorescence of etheno – ATP ( arbitrary units ) was monitored over time . ( G ) Rates of exchange of nucleotides ( k obs ) were determined from the data and plotted as a function of concentrations of the CAS - 1 variants . Data are means 6 s . d . of three independent experiments . Journal of Cell Science 125 ( 17 ) 4082 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e which MBP – CAS - 1 ( or CAS - 1 fragments ) was pulled down by beads with conjugated anti - MBP antibody ( supplementary material Fig . S3 ) . We also tested if CAS - 1 differentially binds to ATP – or ADP – actin , as yeast Srv2 / CAP binds to ADP – actin with higher affinity than ATP – actin ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) . The results indicated that ATP – actin and ADP – actin equally bound to MBP – CAS - 1 ( supplementary material Fig . S3A , C , lane 3 ) and MBP – CAS - 1C ( Fig . 4A , C , lane 7 ) . However , the amounts of ATP – or ADP – actin that co - precipitated with MBP – CAS - 1N ( supplementary material Fig . S3A , C , lane 5 ) were not significantly different from those with MBP ( supplementary material Fig . S3A , C , lane 1 ) , suggesting that binding of MBP – CAS - 1N with actin is too weak to be detectable under these experimental conditions . We also found that UNC - 60B did not co - precipitate with MBP – CAS - 1 , MBP – CAS - 1N , or MBP – CAS - 1C ( supplementary material Fig . S3A , C , lanes 4 , 6 and 8 ) and that UNC - 60B did not affect the amount of precipitated actin ( supplementary material Fig . S3A , C , lanes 4 , 6 and 8 ) . Based on our previous studies ( Yamashiro et al . , 2005 ) , UNC - 60B is expected to bind to actin under these conditions . Therefore , lack of UNC - 60B in the precipitates suggests that UNC - 60B was dissociated from actin in the presence of MBP – CAS - 1 or MBP – CAS - 1C . Next , we tested whether CAS - 1 has activity to enhance exchange of actin - bound nucleotides , as demonstrated for CAPs in other organisms ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ; Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ) ( Fig . 4 ) . ATP - bound G - actin was incubated with various concentrations of CAS - 1 in the presence of etheno – ATP whose fluorescence is increased upon binding to actin , and changes in its fluorescence were monitored . MBP – CAS - 1 strongly enhanced the rate of nucleotide exchange ( Fig . 4A ) . In the presence of 0 . 5 m M MBP – CAS - 1 , the exchange rate was enhanced more than 10 - fold ( Fig . 4G , black circles ) . Substoichiometric concentrations of MBP – CAS - 1 ( 0 . 02 – 0 . 5 m M MBP – CAS - 1 to 1 m M G - actin ) had significant effects . However , neither MBP – CAS - 1N ( Fig . 6C , G , black triangles ) nor MBP – CAS - 1C ( Fig . 4E , black squares ) enhanced nucleotide exchange . MBP – CAS - 1N even had a weak inhibitory effect on nucleotide exchange ( Fig . 4G , black triangles ) . MBP – CAS - 1C slightly enhanced overall fluorescence ( Fig . 4E ) , which might be due to its binding to G - actin as observed for human CAP1 ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ) . These results indicate that both N - and C - terminal halves of CAS - 1 are required for this activity . We also tested effects of CAS - 1 on nucleotide exchange of ADP - bound actin ( supplementary material Fig . S4A , C , E ) . However , ADP – actin exchanged nucleotides much faster than ATP – actin , as reported previously ( Kinosian et al . , 1993 ) , and we were unable to determine the effects of CAS - 1 . UNC - 60B , in contrast , bound to G - actin and inhibited exchange of actin - bound ATP ( Fig . 4B , black curve ) as demonstrated previously ( Yamashiro et al . , 2005 ) . However , this inhibitory effect of UNC - 60B was relieved by MBP – CAS - 1 ( Fig . 4B , G , white circles ) . Again , substoichiometric concentrations of MBP – CAS - 1 ( 0 . 02 – 0 . 5 m M MBP – CAS - 1 ) strongly enhanced nucleotide exchange even in the presence of 1 m M UNC - 60B . MBP – CAS - 1N had no effect on UNC - 60B - inhibited nucleotide exchange Fig . 5 . Effects of CAS - 1 and UNC - 60B on actin filament turnover as determined by the rate of phosphate release . Final 5 m M F - actin was mixed with various concentrations of UNC - 60B and MBP – CAS - 1 ( A ) , MBP – CAS - 1N ( B ) or MBP – CAS - 1C ( C ) , and the rate of Pi release ( arbitrary units ) was determined and plotted as a function of concentrations of UNC - 60B . ( D ) Rate of Pi release from 5 m M F - actin with 5 m M UNC - 60B in the presence of 0 – 0 . 5 m M MBP – CAS - 1 ( circles ) , MBP – CAS - 1N ( triangles ) or MBP – CAS - 1C ( squares ) were plotted as a function of the concentrations of the CAS - 1 variants . Data are means 6 s . d . of three independent experiments . C . elegans cyclase - associated protein 4083 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e ( Fig . 4D ) , whereas 0 . 5 m M MBP – CAS - 1C weakly relieved the effect of UNC - 60B ( Fig . 4F ) . This might be due to dissociation of UNC - 60B from G - actin , as the C - terminal actin - binding site of yeast SRV2 / CAP1 is known to compete with cofilin for G - actin binding ( Mattila et al . , 2004 ) . Similar experiments using ADP - bound actin showed similar effects of CAS - 1 on exchange of actin - bound nucleotides ( supplementary material Fig . S4B , D , F ) , suggesting that CAS - 1 interacts equally with ATP – and ADP – actin , as reported for plant CAP ( Chaudhry et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , both N - and C - terminal halves of CAS - 1 are required for efficient exchange of actin - bound nucleotides in the presence of ADF / cofilin . To determine effects of CAS - 1 on actin filament turnover , we measured the rate of inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) release from actin filaments . The Pi release rate is an appropriate parameter for actin filament turnover or actin monomer recycling because it is enhanced after completion of essential turnover processes : monomer dissociation from F - actin , nucleotide exchange on G - actin , incorporation into F - actin , and ATP hydrolysis on F - actin ( Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ) . Alternatively Pi release can be enhanced if F - actin - binding of ADF / cofilin is enhanced ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 1999 ) . In the absence of MBP – CAS - 1 , UNC - 60B by itself moderately enhanced Pi release ( Fig . 5A , black circles ) . MBP – CAS - 1 further enhanced UNC - 60B - dependent Pi release in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 5A , D , circles ) . The Pi release was enhanced by substoichiometric amounts of MBP – CAS - 1 , suggesting that CAS - 1 enhanced actin turnover in a catalytic manner . MBP – CAS - 1N did not significantly enhance Pi release ( Fig . 5B , D , triangles ) , whereas MBP – CAS - 1C moderately enhanced Pi release ( Fig . 5C , D , squares ) . These results indicate that the C - terminal half of CAS - 1 is required for enhancement of actin filament turnover , and that both N - and C - terminal halves are required for strong enhancement of this activity . Effects of CAS - 1 and UNC - 60B were also examined by direct observation of actin filaments ( Fig . 6 ) . Fluorescently labeled actin was polymerized in the presence or absence of CAS - 1 and / or UNC - 60B for 30 min , and the filaments were observed by fluorescence microscopy . MBP – CAS - 1 by itself does not have significant effect on lengths of actin filaments ( Fig . 6 , compare A and E ) . UNC - 60B ( 1 m M ) shortened actin filaments to , 50 % of the control ( Fig . 6 , compare A and B ) due to its severing effect ( Ono et al . , 2008 ; Ono et al . , 2004 ) . Interestingly , in the presence of UNC - 60B , MBP – CAS - 1 further shortened filaments by 40 % ( Fig . 6 , compare B and F ) . MBP ( Fig . 6C , D ) and MBP – CAS - 1N ( Fig . 6G , H ) did not have a significant effect on filament lengths , while MBP – CAS - 1C had a similar effect on filament lengths to MBP – CAS - 1 ( Fig . 6I , J ) . Although the precise mechanism of this effect is not clear , CAS - 1 and UNC - 60B can cooperate to keep actin filaments short and maintain a dynamic state of actin filaments . cas - 1 is essential for viability and sarcomeric actin organization To determine in vivo roles of CAS - 1 in C . elegans , we characterized cas - 1 mutant phenotypes . cas - 1 ( ok1523 ) is a deletion of 2 . 7 kb , which removes second and third exons and induces a frame - shift . This results in potential production of an mRNA coding for only 39 amino acids from the N - terminus , which is unlikely to be functional . Therefore , cas - 1 ( ok1523 ) is a putative null allele . Most of cas - 1 ( ok1523 ) homozygotes were arrested at variable larval stages and became immobile , while heterozygous animals were indistinguishable from wild type . Very few cas - 1 ( ok1523 ) homozygotes became adults but failed to reproduce . Examination of cas - 1 ( ok1523 ) mutant worms by phalloidin staining showed that sarcomeric actin filaments in the body wall muscle of arrested larvae and survived adults were severely disorganized with formation of a number of F - actin aggregates ( Fig . 7B ) . In comparison , wild - type worms had highly ordered sarcomeric actin structures in the body wall muscle ( Fig . 7A ) . Abnormalities of F - actin organization were not detected in other tissues , suggesting that cas - 1 primarily functions in the body wall muscle and is required for organized assembly of sarcomeric actin filaments . Abnormalities of actin filament organization were also detected in embryonic muscle of the cas - 1 ( ok1523 ) mutant , suggesting that Fig . 6 . Effects of CAS - 1 and UNC - 60B on the lengths of actin filaments . Actin ( 2 m M , 20 % DyLight549 - labeled ) was polymerized without an MBP fusion protein ( A , B ) , or with 0 . 5 m M MBP ( C , D ) , MBP – CAS - 1 ( E , F ) , MBP – CAS - 1N ( G , H ) or MBP – CAS - 1C ( I , J ) in the absence ( A , C , E , G , I ) or presence of 1 m M UNC - 60B ( B , D , F , H , J ) and observed by fluorescence microscopy . Filament lengths ( averages 6 s . d . , n 5 50 ) are shown on the lower right corner of each panel . Journal of Cell Science 125 ( 17 ) 4084 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e CAS - 1 is required for an early stage of myofibril assembly ( Fig . 7C – K ) . In wild - type and cas - 1 / + heterozygous embryos , actin was assembled into linearly organized myofibrils in the body wall muscle ( Fig . 7C , F , arrows ) . However , in the cas - 1 homozygous embryos , actin became discontinuous and was often concentrated into aggregates ( Fig . 7I , arrowheads ) . Thus , CAS - 1 is required for organized assembly of actin filaments in embryonic muscle . Subcellular localization of UNC - 60B was significantly altered in the cas - 1 mutant muscle ( Fig . 7J ) . In wild - type and cas - 1 / + heterozygous embryos , UNC - 60B was specifically expressed in the body wall muscle and localized to the diffuse cytoplasm ( Fig . 7D , G , arrows ) . However , in the cas - 1 homozygous embryos , diffuse localization of UNC - 60B was diminished , and UNC - 60B was concentrated into aggregates where actin was also accumulated ( Fig . 7J , K , arrowheads ) . The formation of UNC - 60B – actin aggregates suggests that UNC - 60B and actin remain in a stable complex in the absence of CAS - 1 , and that proper recycling of UNC - 60B and actin for persistent actin filament turnover is not operated in the cas - 1 mutant . This is consistent with our in vitro observations that CAS - 1 promotes UNC - 60B - dependent actin filament turnover . In contrast , localization of CAS - 1 was not disturbed in an unc - 60B - null mutant ( Fig . 8 ) . unc - 60B ( su158 ) is a null allele , and unc - 60B ( su158 ) homozygotes had severely disorganized actin filaments with formation of actin aggregates in the body wall muscle ( Fig . 8B ) , as described previously ( Ono et al . , 2003 ) . Nonetheless , CAS - 1 remained associated with striated myofibrils ( Fig . 8A , arrows ) . Striations of CAS - 1 did not overlap with those of actin ( Fig . 8A – C , arrows ) , indicating that CAS - 1 remained localized to the M - lines in the unc - 60B mutant . Furthermore , CAS - 1 was absent from the actin aggregates ( Fig . 8A – C , arrowheads ) . These results suggest that myofibril localization of CAS - 1 is independent of UNC - 60B and actin , and that CAS - 1 does not bind to actin filaments in the absence of UNC - 60B - mediated actin filament turnover . Discussion In this study , we demonstrate that CAS - 1 is a C . elegans homolog of CAP , which is essential for viability and sarcomeric actin organization in striated muscle . In vitro , CAS - 1 binds to monomeric actin , enhances exchange of actin - bound nucleotides , and , promotes actin filament turnover in the presence of UNC - 60B ( a muscle - specific ADF / cofilin ) . Previous studies have shown that UNC - 60B is an essential regulator of sarcomeric actin organization in the body wall muscle ( McKim et al . , 1994 ; Ono et al . , 2003 ; Ono et al . , 1999 ) . These results strongly suggest that enhancement of actin filament turnover by CAS - 1 and UNC - 60B is essential for assembly of sarcomeric actin filaments in the C . elegans body wall muscle . Mammals also have muscle - specific isoforms of ADF / cofilin ( cofilin - 2 ) ( Ono et al . , 1994 ; Thirion et al . , 2001 ; Vartiainen et al . , 2002 ) and CAP ( CAP2 ) ( Peche et al . , 2007 ; Swiston et al . , 1995 ; Wolanski et al . , 2009 ; Yu et al . , 1994 ) , suggesting that collaboration of ADF / cofilin and CAP is a conserved mechanism of the regulation of actin dynamics in striated muscle .

Merged images are shown in E , H and K ( actin in green and UNC - 60B in red ) . Arrows in C – H indicate positions of the body wall muscle . Arrowheads in I – K indicate abnormal aggregates of actin and UNC - 60B . C . elegans cyclase - associated protein 4085 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e The sequence and domain structure of C . elegans CAS - 1 are conserved with CAPs from other species with some differences ( supplementary material Fig . S1 ) . In addition to the lack of a second proline - rich region , we noticed a potential difference between CAS - 1 and other CAPs in the N - termini . The N - terminal end of yeast Srv2 / CAP is predicted to form a coiled coil and implicated in its association with adenylate cyclase ( Nishida et al . , 1998 ) or oligomerization ( Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ) . Analysis by COILS , a prediction tool for coiled coils ( Lupas et al . , 1991 ) , indicates that the N - terminal region of yeast Srv2 / CAP exhibits high probability of forming a coiled coil , but an equivalent region of C . elegans CAS - 1 shows very low probability of forming a coiled coil ( data not shown ) . However , analysis by Multicoil2 , a more recently published tool for prediction of coiled coils ( Trigg et al . , 2011 ) , predicted that both yeast Srv2 / CAP and C . elegans CAS - 1 do not form coiled coils ( data not shown ) . The N - terminal 50 amino acids of Dictyostelium CAP are flexible and unstructured as revealed by NMR ( Mavoungou et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , the N - terminal region of CAP may become structured only when it binds to a ligand , but this property still needs to be verified by biochemical or biophysical methods . CAS - 1 has similar biochemical activities to CAPs from other species , but we detected two unique properties of CAS - 1 . First , the N - terminal half of CAS - 1 ( CAS - 1N ) weakly bound to G - actin in the absence of UNC - 60B . An equivalent region of human CAP1 also weakly binds to G - actin ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ) , but that of yeast Srv2 / CAP only binds to the actin – cofilin complex ( Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ) . G - actin binding of the CAS - 1N resulted in slight retardation of polymerization and weak inhibition of nucleotide exchange . However , their functional significance is not clear , since these effects are weak and require high concentrations of CAS - 1N . Second , the C - terminal half of CAS - 1 ( CAS - 1C ) alone had much weaker activity to enhance exchange of G - actin - bound nucleotide than full - length CAS - 1 . In yeast and human CAPs , the C - terminal halves promote nucleotide exchange as strongly as full - length proteins ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ; Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ) . CAS - 1C contained WH2 and putative b - sheet domains , and bound to G - actin , suggesting that G - actin binding is not sufficient to enhance nucleotide exchange . Therefore , our CAS - 1C construct may not have an essential sequence for nucleotide exchange or may include an inhibitory sequence . To clarify this problem , additional experiments are required to determine regulatory sequences for promotion of nucleotide exchange . Our biochemical studies showed that CAS - 1 strongly promoted exchange of G - actin - bound nucleotides antagonistically to UNC - 60B and enhanced actin filament turnover in collaboration with UNC - 60B . These observations agree with recently reported properties of CAPs in mammals ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ) , yeast ( Balcer et al . , 2003 ; Quintero - Monzon et al . , 2009 ) and plants ( Chaudhry et al . , 2007 ) . Although CAP sequesters actin monomers in vitro ( Freeman et al . , 1995 ; Gieselmann and Mann , 1992 ) , stoichiometric amounts of CAP are required for effective actin monomer sequestration . In contrast , enhancement of actin filament turnover can be achieved by substoichiometric concentrations of CAP in the presence of ADF / cofilin . Therefore , the latter function is more likely to be a physiologically important function of CAP . The role of CAP in actin filament turnover is also consistent with our observed CAS - 1 knockout phenotypes and previously reported essential roles of CAP in lamellipodial extension ( Rogers et al . , 2003 ) , stress fiber formation ( Freeman and Field , 2000 ) , cell polarity ( Baum et al . , 2000 ) and plant development ( Barrero et al . , 2002 ; Deeks et al . , 2007 ) , which cannot be explained simply by the actin - monomer sequestering activity . CAS - 1 is also expressed in several non - muscle cells ( Fig . 1D – F ) and might be involved in the regulation of other actin - dependent events . Functional significance of localization of CAS - 1 to the M - lines in sarcomeres is still unclear . However , it is intriguing that mammalian CAP2 is predominantly expressed in striated muscle and also localizes to the M - lines ( Peche et al . , 2007 ) . Apparently , this localization pattern is independent of UNC - 60B and actin ( Fig . 8 ) . Given that CAS - 1 can enhance actin turnover at very low concentrations , the M - line might be a temporary anchoring or storage site . Therefore , dynamic nature of CAS - 1 at the M - lines is important information to understand its significance . Proline - rich regions of CAP are known to bind to Src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains ( Freeman et al . , 1996 ; Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) . Intriguingly , C . elegans UNC - 89 , an obscurin - like protein , is a component of the M - lines in the body wall muscle and has an SH3 domain near its N - terminus ( Benian et al . , 1996 ) . Whether UNC - 89 binds to CAS - 1 and is required for M - line localization of CAS - 1 will be determined in the future . The M - lines are closely located to the pointed ends of sarcomeric actin filaments , where actin monomers are actively exchanged ( Littlefield et al . , 2001 ) . We have previously shown that ADF / cofilin ( UNC - 60B ) cooperates with tropomodulin , an actin pointed - end capping Fig . 8 . UNC - 60B deficiency does not affect myofibril localization of CAS - 1 . Immunolocalization of CAS - 1 ( A ) and actin ( B ) in the body wall muscle of unc - 60B ( su158 ) adult worms . A merged image is shown in C with CAS - 1 in red and actin in green . Arrows indicate positions of the M - lines , where CAS - 1 remained localized . Arrowheads indicate actin aggregates where CAS - 1 did not localize . Journal of Cell Science 125 ( 17 ) 4086 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e protein , to promote sarcomeric actin organization ( Yamashiro et al . , 2008 ) . If the pointed ends of sarcomeric actin filaments are sites of ADF / cofilin - induced actin turnover , accumulation of CAS - 1 to the M - lines may facilitate cooperation between ADF / cofilin and CAS - 1 . Our study provides biochemical and genetic evidence that CAS - 1 is an essential regulator of actin filament dynamics for sarcomeric actin organization in striated muscle . We hypothesize that C . elegans CAS - 1 is functionally homologous to vertebrate CAP2 based on their similarities in muscle expression and M - line localization . Previous studies have shown that muscle - specific ADF / cofilin isoforms are essential for sarcomeric actin assembly in both C . elegans and mammals ( Ono , 2010 ) . Therefore , cooperative enhancement of actin filament turnover by ADF / cofilin and CAP might be a conserved mechanism for organized assembly of sarcomeres in striated muscle . Requirement of CAP for muscle actin organization and viability in C . elegans strongly suggests that a deficiency in vertebrate CAP2 also causes severe muscle defects or lethality . Additional analysis of the function of CAS - 1 in C . elegans and functional studies on CAP2 in vertebrate muscle should be important for advancing our knowledge on the mechanism of assembly and organization of sarcomeric actin filaments in striated muscle . Materials and Methods Nematode strains Nematodes were grown at 20 ˚ C as described previously ( Brenner , 1974 ) . Wild - type strain N2 was obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center ( Minneapolis , MN ) . cas - 1 ( ok1523 ) X was isolated as the strain VC1144 by the C . elegans Gene Knockout Consortium ( Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada and Oklahoma , OH , USA ) , outcrossed four times , and maintained in the strain ON169 + / szT1 [ lon - 2 ( e678 ) ] I ; cas - 1 ( ok1523 ) / szT1 X . unc - 60B ( su158 ) V was described previously ( Ono et al . , 2003 ; Zengel and Epstein , 1980 ) . Proteins Rabbit muscle actin was purified from acetone powder ( Pel - Freez Biologicals ) as described previously ( Pardee and Spudich , 1982 ) . Pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle actin was prepared as described ( Kouyama and Mihashi , 1981 ) . ADP – G - actin was prepared as described previously ( Moriyama and Yahara , 2002 ) with some modifications . ATP – G - actin ( 15 m M ) in G - buffer was incubated with 20 units / ml hexokinase ( Worthington Biochemical Corp . ) in the presence of 50 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , and 0 . 3 mM glucose at 4 ˚ C for 2 hr . UNC - 60B was expressed in E . coli and purified as described previously ( Ono and Benian , 1998 ) . Recombinant CAS - 1 proteins The full - length protein coding sequence of CAS - 1 was amplified from a cDNA clone yk1657b05 ( kindly provided by Yuji Kohara , Mishima , Shizuoka , Japan ) , and cloned into the pGEX - 2T vector . Originally , we attempted bacterial expression of CAS - 1 using a glutathione S - transferase fusion system , but solubility of recombinant fusion proteins was very poor ( our unpublished observations ) . Then , full - length CAS - 1 , CAS - 1N or CAS - 1C sequences were re - cloned into the pDEST - HisMBP , a vector for bacterial expression as fusion proteins with MBP with an N - terminal histidine tag as described previously ( Nallamsetty and Waugh , 2007 ) using the Gateway H technology with Clonase TM II ( Invitrogen ) . pDEST - HisMBP was developed by the group of David Waugh ( Nallamsetty et al . , 2005 ) and obtained through Addgene . The protein coding sequences were verified by DNA sequencing . E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) was transformed with the expression vectors , and protein expression was inducted by adding 1 mM isopropyl - b - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside for 3 hr at room temperature . The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for 10 min and disrupted by a French pressure cell at 360 – 580 kg / cm 2 in phosphate - buffered saline . The homogenates were cleared at 20 , 000 g for 15 min and applied to a His60 Ni Superflow TM column ( Clontech ) and washed with 150 mM NaCl , 3 mM imidazole , 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 9 to remove unbound proteins . Bound proteins were eluted with 150 mM NaCl , 250 mM imidazole , 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 9 . MBP – CAS - 1 ( full - length ) was further purified with a HiPrep 26 / 60 Sephacryl S - 300 column ( GE Healthcare ) , while MBP – CAS - 1N and MBP – CAS - 1C were further purified with a Resource Q column ( GE Healthcare ) . MBP was used without additional chromatographic purification . Finally , purified proteins were dialyzed against F - buffer [ 0 . 1 M KCl , 20 mM Hepes - NaOH , pH 7 . 5 , 2 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 2 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) ] containing 50 % glycerol and stored at 2 20 ˚ C . Preparation of anti - CAS - 1 antibody Anti - CAS - 1 antisera were raised in rabbit using GST - CAS - 1C as an immunogen at Lampire Biological Laboratories . Anti - CAS - 1 antibody was affinity - purified by adsorbing to MBP – CAS - 1 that had been immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes and eluting with 0 . 1 M glycine – HCl , pH 2 . 5 . Fluorescence microscopy Immunofluorescent staining of adult nematodes was performed as described previously ( Finney and Ruvkun , 1990 ) . Immunofluorescent staining of embryos was performed as described previously ( Ono et al . , 2003 ) . Briefly , worm embryos were collected by cutting gravid adults and picking from agar plates on polylysine - coated slides , permeabilized by a freeze - crack method ( Epstein et al . , 1993 ) , and fixed with methanol at 2 20 ˚ C for 5 min . They were washed by phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) for 10 min and stained with primary antibodies diluted in 1 % bovine serum albumin in PBS . They were visualized by staining with Alexa - Fluor - 488 - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( Invitrogen ) and Cy3 - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti - CAS - 1 polyclonal ( this study ) , mouse anti - MYO - 3 monoclonal ( 5 – 6 ) ( Miller et al . , 1983 ) , mouse anti - UNC - 89 monoclonal ( MH42 ) ( Benian et al . , 1996 ) , mouse anti - vinculin monoclonal ( MH24 ) ( Francis and Waterston , 1985 ) , mouse anti - a - actinin monoclonal ( MH40 ) ( Francis and Waterston , 1985 ) , mouse anti - actin monoclonal ( C4 ; MP Biomedicals ) and rabbit anti - UNC - 60B ( Ono et al . , 1999 ) antibodies . Staining of whole worms with tetramethylrhodamine – phalloidin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was performed as described previously ( Ono , 2001 ) . Samples were mounted with ProLong Gold ( Invitrogen ) and observed by epifluorescence using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 inverted microscope with a CFI Plan Fluor ELWD 40 6 ( Dry ; NA 0 . 60 ) or Plan Apo 60 6 ( oil ; NA 1 . 40 ) objective . Images were captured by a SPOTRT monochrome CCD camera ( Diagnostic Instruments ) and processed by IPLab imaging software ( BD Biosciences ) and Adobe Photoshop CS3 . Monitoring kinetics of actin polymerization Kinetics of actin polymerization was monitored by measuring fluorescence of pyrene - labeled actin . Pyrene - labeled G - actin ( final concentration of 5 m M ; referred to as final 5 m M ; 20 % labeled ) was mixed with MBP – CAS - 1 , MBP – CAS - 1N , MBP – CAS - 1C or MBP in G buffer ( 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 2 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) , and polymerization was initiated by adding salts to final concentrations of 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 20 mM Hepes - NaOH , pH 7 . 5 . Fluorescence of pyrene ( excitation at 366 nm and emission at 384 nm ) was monitored for 10 min with an LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer ( PerkinElmer ) . Relative rates of actin polymerization were calculated by the increase of the pyrene fluorescence from time 0 to 350 sec ( D F ) , when approximately 50 % of control actin ( no CAS - 1 protein ) was polymerized , as D F CAS - 1 / D F control 6 100 ( % ) . Determination of critical concentration of actin Varying concentrations of pyrene - labeled G - actin ( 20 % labeled ) were polymerized in 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 20 mM Hepes - NaOH , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , pH 7 . 5 for 18 hr at room temperature . Fluorescence of pyrene ( excitation at 366 nm and emission at 384 nm ) was measured with a LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer ( PerkinElmer ) . Equilibrium dissociation constant for CAS - 1 binding to G - actin was calculated from the apparent change in the critical concentration as described ( Carlier et al . , 1993 ) . Non - denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Non - denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously ( Ono et al . , 2001 ; Safer , 1989 ) . Briefly , protein samples except for MBP or CAS - 1 proteins were pre - incubated in G buffer for 30 min at room temperature , followed by addition of MBP or CAS - 1 proteinsfor30 min , supplemented with0 . 25 volume of a loading buffer ( 50 % glycerol and 0 . 05 % Bromophenol Blue ) , and electrophoresed using a Bicine / triethanolamine buffer system ( 50 mM Bicine , 40 mM triethanolamine , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM EGTA ) at 4 ˚ C . The proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R - 250 ( National Diagnostic ) . Assay for exchange of actin - bound nucleotides Effects of CAS - 1 variants and UNC - 60B on the exchange rate of actin - bound nucleotides were examined by monitoring increase in the fluorescence of etheno – ATP that is associated with G - actin binding ( Wang and Taylor , 1981 ) . G - actin ( 1 . 5 m M ) was prepared in 100 m l of G - buffer without ATP , and then 50 m l of etheno – ATP ( 120 m M ) with or without CAS - 1 variants and UNC - 60B was mixed . Final concentrations of G - actin and UNC - 60B were both 1 m M . Then , fluorescence of etheno – ATP ( excitation at 350 nm and emission at 410 nm ) was monitored for 10 min with a HITACHI F - 4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer . The exponential rates ( k obs ) were calculated by curve fitting using SigmaPlot 10 ( Systat Software ) . Measurements of actin turnover by phosphate release Phosphate release during actin filament turnover was measured using an EnzChek Pi assay kit ( Invitrogen ) . Final 5 m M F - actin was mixed with various C . elegans cyclase - associated protein 4087 J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e concentrations of UNC - 60B and CAS - 1 variants in the presence of 0 . 1 mM 2 - amino - 6 - mercapto - 7 - methylpurine riboside and 0 . 4 unit / ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase in F - buffer ( 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 20 mM Hepes - NaOH , pH 7 . 5 ) , and absorbance at 360 nm was monitored over time using a DU640 spectrophotometer ( Beckman Coulter ) . Phosphate release was initially enhanced due to dilution - induced actin depolymerization . Therefore , a steady - state rate of Pi release was determined by a slope of a linear phase followed by the initial burst of Pi release ( see supplementary material Fig . S5 ) . Direct observation of actin filaments by fluorescence microscopy DyLight549 - labeled actin was prepared as described previously ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . G - actin ( 2 m M , 20 % DyLight549 labeled ) was mixed with 0 . 5 m M MBP , MBP – CAS - 1 , MBP – CAS - 1N , or MBP – CAS - 1C in the presence or absence of 1 m M UNC - 60B in G - buffer and polymerized for 30 min at room temperature by addition of final 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , and 20 mM Hepes - NaOH , pH 7 . 5 . The samples were mounted on nitrocellulose - coated coverslips and filaments observed by fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon TE2000 microscope with a Plan Apo 60 6 ( oil ; NA 1 . 40 ) objective . Images were captured by a SPOT RT monochrome CCD camera and processed by IPLab imaging software and Adobe Photoshop CS3 . Filament lengths were measured using a length - measurement tool of IPLab after manually tracing filaments on captured images .
