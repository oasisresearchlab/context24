Abstract . To characterize the molecular mechanisms involved in the carcinogenesis and progression of small - cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) and identify molecules to be applied as novel diagnostic markers and / or for development of molecular - targeted drugs , we applied cDNA microarray profile analysis coupled with purification of cancer cells by laser - microbeam microdissection ( LMM ) . Expression profiles of 32 , 256 genes in 15 SCLCs identified 252 genes that were commonly up - regulated and 851 transcripts that were down - regulated in SCLC cells compared with non - cancerous lung tissue cells . An unsupervised clustering algorithm applied to the expression data easily distinguished SCLC from the other major histo - logical type of non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and identified 475 genes that may represent distinct molecular features of each of the two histological types . In particular , SCLC was characterized by altered expression of genes related to neuroendocrine cell differentiation and / or growth such as ASCL1 , NRCAM , and INSM1 . We also identified 68 genes that were abundantly expressed both in advanced SCLCs and advanced adenocarcinomas ( ADCs ) , both of which had been obtained from patients with extensive chemotherapy treatment . Some of them are known to be transcription factors and / or gene expression regulators such as TAF5L , TFCP2L4 , PHF20 , LMO4 , TCF20 , RFX2 , and DKFZp547I048 as well as those encoding nucleotide - binding proteins such as C9orf76 , EHD3 , and GIMAP4 . Our data provide valuable information for better understanding of lung carcinogenesis and chemoresistance . Introduction A number of genetic alterations associated with development and progression of lung cancer , one of the tumors showing the worst prognosis , have been reported , but its precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear ( 1 ) . Two major histologically - distinct types of lung cancer , non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and small - cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) have different pathophysiological and clinical features that suggest differences in the mechanisms of their carcinogenesis . SCLC accounts for 15 - 20 % of all lung cancers ( 2 , 3 ) and is categorized as neuroendocrine tumors of the lung with certain morphologic , ultrastructural , and immunohistochemical characteristics . Some paraneoplastic syndromes such as inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone , ectopic Cushing ' s syndrome , and the Lambert - Eaton myasthenic syndrome ( LEMS ) are known to be associated with SCLC , however , the detailed molecular characteristics of neuroendocrine tumors are still not well understood . Although patients with SCLC respond favorably to 1st line multi - agent chemotherapy , they often relapse in a short time . Hence , only 20 % of patients with limited - stage disease ( LD ) can be cured with combined modality therapy and < 5 % of those with extensive - disease ( ED ) can achieve 5 - year survival after the initial diagnosis ( 4 , 5 ) . Therefore , new therapeutic strategies such as molecular - targeted agents are eagerly awaited . The genome - wide cDNA microarray analysis enabled us to obtain comprehensive gene expression profiles related to detailed phenotypic and biological information in cancer cells ( 6 - 8 ) . This approach is also useful to identify unknown molecules involved in the pathways of lung carcinogenesis ( 9 - 11 ) . We , in fact , have identified multiple applicable targets for development of novel anti - cancer drugs and / or diagnostic markers ( 12 - 17 ) . Through gene - expression profile analysis of 15 SCLCs coupled with purification of cancer cell population by laser - microbeam microdissection ( LMM ) on a cDNA microarray consisting of 32 , 256 cDNAs , we identified a number of genes that were expressed differently between the two most common histological types of lung cancer , NSCLC and SCLC .

Materials and methods Patients and tissue samples . Advanced SCLC tissue samples were obtained with informed consent from post - mortem materials ( 15 individuals ) at Hiroshima University ( Hiroshima , Japan ) . Individual institutional ethical committees approved the use of all clinical materials . Patients ' clinical information was obtained from medical records . All samples were immediately frozen and embedded in TissueTek OCT medium ( Sakura , Tokyo , Japan ) and stored at - 80˚C until use for microarray analysis . Laser - microbeam microdissection , extraction of RNA and T7 - based RNA amplification . Cancer cells were selectively collected from the preserved samples using laser - microbeam microdissection ( 10 , 11 ) . The quality of RNAs extracted from the residual tissue of each case was checked by electrophoresis in the degenerative agarose gel and ensured by a presence of clear ribosomal RNA bands . Extraction of total RNA and T7 - based amplification were performed as described previously ( 10 , 11 ) . As a control probe , normal human lung poly ( A ) RNA ( BD Biosciences Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) was amplified in the same manner ; 2 . 5 μg each of amplified RNAs ( aRNAs ) from each cancerous tissue and that from the control were reversely transcribed in the presence of Cy5 - dCTP and Cy3 - dCTP , respectively . cDNA microarrays . Our genome - wide cDNA microarray system containing 32 , 256 cDNAs that were selected on the basis of the information in the UniGene database ( build # 188 ) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) was used for this analysis . Fabrication of the microarray , hybridization , washing , and detection of signal intensities were described previously ( 10 , 18 ) . Data analysis . Signal intensities of Cy3 and Cy5 from the 32 , 256 spots were quantified and analyzed by substituting backgrounds , using ArrayVision software ( Imaging Research Inc . , Ontario , Canada ) . Subsequently , the fluorescent intensities of Cy5 ( tumor ) and Cy3 ( control ) for each target spot were adjusted so that the mean Cy5 / Cy3 ratio of 52 housekeeping genes on the array was equal to one . Because data derived from low signal intensities are less reliable , we determined a cut - off value on each slide as described previously ( 10 ) and excluded genes from further analysis when both Cy3 and Cy5 dyes yielded signal intensities lower than the cut - off . For other genes , we calculated the Cy5 / Cy3 ratio using the raw data of each sample . Cluster analysis of SCLC and NSCLCs . We applied a hier - archical clustering method to both genes and tumors . To obtain reproducible clusters for classification of the 15 SCLC , and an independent set of 62 NSCLC ( 20 early - stage ADC , 15 early - stage SCC , and 27 advanced ADC ) samples analyzed previously using a cDNA microarray containing a subset ( 27 , 648 genes ) of 32 , 256 genes on our present microarray - system ( data from refs . 9 and 11 , and our unpublished data for the expression of 4608 genes in the same set of 35 early - stage NSCLC ) , we selected genes from them for which valid data were obtained in 80 % of the experiments , and whose expression ratios varied by standard deviations of > 1 . 7 . The analysis was performed using web - available software ( ‘Cluster’ and ‘TreeView’ ) written by M . Eisen ( http : / / rana . lbl . gov / index . htm ) . Before applying the clustering algorithm , we log - transformed the fluorescence ratio for each spot and then median - centered the data for each sample to remove experimental biases . Semi - quantitative RT - PCR . We selected highly up - regulated genes and examined their expression levels by means of semi - quantitative RT - PCR experiments as previously described ( 16 ) . aRNA ( 3 μg ) from each sample was reversely tran - scribed to single - stranded cDNAs using random primer ( Roche ) and Superscript II ( Invitrogen ) . Semi - quantitative RT - PCR experiments were carried out with the following sets of synthesized primers specific to the 10 representative genes that were up - regulated in SCLCs or with ß - actin ( ACTB ) - specific primers as an internal control : K562 cell - derived leucine - zipper - like protein 1 ( KLP1 ) , 5 ' - CCGTCAGCAGTG TGAAGTCT - 3 ' and 5 ' - CCTCCTAAGCAGTCAACCTTGT - 3 ' ; BCL2 - associated athanogene 5 ( BAG5 ) , 5 ' - ATCTGGTTT TTAAGGGTCTGAGC - 3 ' and 5 ' - GCAAGCGTAAGAGAC TGGTTTTA - 3 ' ; solute carrier family 4 , sodium bicarbonate cotransporter , member 5 ( SLC4A5 ) , 5 ' - CTGTCAGGGTCAT AGTAGGCATT - 3 ' and 5 ' - CCAAAGTCAAACTCCCATT CAT - 3 ' ; hypothetical protein FLJ13848 ( FLJ13848 ) , 5 ' - AA AGAGGAACACACTGGGTGTAA - 3 ' and 5 ' - AGGAGCC TAGAGAAGCAATCATC - 3 ' ; brain - specific angiogenesis inhibitor 3 ( BAI3 ) , 5 ' - TTGCTTCCTAATCCCTTTGGTC - 3 ' and 5 ' - TAAGCTGCATCTTGATGCCTTC - 3 ' ; vitelliform macular dystrophy 2 - like 3 ( VMD2L3 ) , 5 ' - CCAGTTACTGT GTCTATCGGGTC - 3 ' and 5 ' - AGCCATATGTAGTCAAGT GCCAT - 3 ' ; cell division cycle 25C ( CDC25C ) , 5 ' - CAGATG CTGGAGGAAGATTCTAA - 3 ' and 5 ' - AAAGAAAGAGGG GGAAACAAAG - 3 ' ; secretory carrier membrane protein 5 ( SCAMP5 ) , 5 ' - AGAACTTTGGCTCCCTTTCC - 3 ' and 5 ' - TGCATAGTTGCCTGGAGATG - 3 ' ; ectodermal - neural cortex ( ENC1 ) , 5 ' - GTCCATGCCATGAATGAGTG - 3 ' and 5 ' - CTC TTGGCAGATTTGCATCA - 3 ' ; CDC20 cell division cycle 20 homolog ( CDC20 ) , 5 ' - CCTCTGGTCTCCCCATTACA - 3 ' and 5 ' - CTGAGGTGATGGGTTGGTCT - 3 ' ; ß - actin ( ACTB ) , 5 ' - GAGGTGATAGCATTGCTTTCG - 3 ' and 5 ' - CAAGTCA GTGTACAGGTAAGC - 3 ' . PCR reactions were optimized for the number of cycles to ensure the PCR product is within the linear phase of amplification . Immunohistochemical analysis . To confirm the differential protein expression of 2 candidate markers ( SCAMP5 and CDC20 ) , which were highly up - regulated in SCLC , we stained clinical tissue sections using ENVISION + Kit / HRP ( DakoCytomation ) . Briefly , after endogenous peroxidase and protein blocking reactions , anti - human SCAMP5 polyclonal antibody ( Medical & Biological Laboratories , Aichi , Japan ) or anti - human CDC20 monoclonal antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , CA ) was added , and then HRP - labeled TANIWAKI et al : EXPRESSION PROFILES OF SMALL - CELL LUNG CANCER 568 567 - 575 20 / 7 / 06 12 : 13 Page 568 anti - rabbit or anti - mouse IgG as the secondary antibody . Substrate - chromogen was then added and the specimens were counterstained with hematoxylin . Results Identification of genes commonly up - and down - regulated in SCLCs . To obtain precise gene expression profiles of SCLC cells , we collected pure populations of cancer cells by LMM to minimize contamination of the tumor cells by non - cancerous cells ( Fig . 1 ) . We identified up - and down - regulated genes common to SCLC according to the following criteria : i ) genes for which we were able to obtain expression data in > 80 % ( at least twelve of the 15 cases ) of the cases examined ; and ii ) genes whose expression ratio was > 10 . 0 or < 0 . 1 in at least 50 % of the informative cases . According to these criteria , a total of 252 genes were listed up as commonly up - regulated and 851 genes as commonly down - regulated in SCLC ( rep - resentative genes are listed in Table I ) . The up - regulated genes represented a variety of functions including genes associated with cell adhesion and cytoskeleton , signal transduction , cell proliferation , and some kinases ( Table I ) . Some of the transactivated genes included in the list , such as GRP , SKP2 and INSM1 were previously reported by others ( 19 - 21 ) . Validation of selected genes by semi - quantitative RT - PCR and immunohistochemical analyses . To validate the expression data obtained by microarray analysis , we performed semi - quantitative RT - PCR experiments for 10 representative genes , which were indicated to be overexpressed commonly in SCLCs ( Fig . 2A ) . The results of RT - PCR experiments were quite concordant with those of the microarray data . To further validate the data at the protein level , we carried out immuno - histochemical analysis using the paired tumor and normal tissue sections using antibodies for SCAMP5 or CDC20 ( Fig . 2B ) . Both proteins were confirmed to be expressed abundantly in SCLCs , but were hardly detectable in normal lung . Cluster analysis of gene expression in lung cancers . We then applied an unsupervised two - dimensional hierarchical clustering algorithm to analyze similarities among samples and among genes , using data obtained from expression profiles of 15 advanced SCLCs as well as 35 early - stage NSCLCs ( ADC and SCC ) and 27 advanced NSCLCs ( ADC ) which we previously analyzed and reported ( 9 , 11 ) ( Fig . 3A ) . Since the INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 29 : 567 - 575 , 2006 569 Figure 1 .

We also excluded genes with observed standard deviations of < 1 . 7 . The 475 genes that passed through this cut - off filter were analyzed further . In the sample axis ( horizontal ) in Fig . 3A , 81 samples ( four cases were examined in duplicate to validate the reproducibility and reliability of our experimental procedure ) , 77 cases were clustered into two major groups on the basis of their expression profiles . The dendrogram shown at the top of Fig . 3 represents similarities in expression patterns among individual cases ; the shorter the branches are , the greater the similarities are . The four duplicated cases ( no . 13 , 20 , K91 , and LC12 ) that were labelled and hybridized in independent experiments were clustered most closely within the same group ( Fig . 3B ) . The identical genes spotted on different positions on the slide glasses were also clustered into adjacent rows ( Fig . 3B ) . These results supported the high reproducibility and reliability of our experimental procedures . Of the 77 cases , 15 SCLC clustered into one major group and 20 early - stage ADC and 15 SCC as well as 27 advanced ADC clustered into individual groups . Clearly , SCLC and NSCLC appeared to have different gene expression profiles that could reflect differences in the etio - logical and clinicopathological natures . In this analysis , we obtained 34 genes which were expressed abundantly in SCLC , some of which revealed characteristics of certain neuronal functions such as neurogenesis and neuroprotection ( Cluster - 1 in Fig . 3A and B ; Table IIA ; i . e . DPYSL2 , ADNP etc ) . Identification of genes related to chemoresistance . Since chemoresistance is a major obstacle for cancer treatment , identification of genes commonly up - regulated in cancer cells obtained from patients who had failed certain chemotherapy is an effective approach to understand the mechanism of chemoresistance and develop a novel cancer therapy that overcomes this problem . We obtained 68 genes expressed abundantly both in advanced SCLCs and advanced ADCs ( Cluster - 2 in Fig . 3A and C ; Table IIB ) , both of which were obtained from patients who had extensive chemotherapy treatments ( although the chemotherapy protocols provided to these patients were not the same ) . Some of them are known to be transcription factors and / or gene expression regulators such as TAF5L , TFCP2L4 , PHF20 , LMO4 , TCF20 , RFX2 , TANIWAKI et al : EXPRESSION PROFILES OF SMALL - CELL LUNG CANCER 570 Table I .

Furthermore , some genes encoding nucleotide - binding proteins such as C9orf76 , EHD3 , and GIMAP4 were also found in the list . Discussion Chemotherapy remains as the essential component for treat - ment of patients with SCLC , regardless of their stage ( either LD or ED ) or performance status . In LD , a combination of chemotherapy with radiation therapy improves patient prog - nosis better than chemotherapy alone ( 22 , 23 ) . SCLC is usually sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in first - line treatment , but the period of good response is often very limited and most of the patients ultimately relapse with treatment - resistant disease . Hence , the final outcome of SCLC patients is poor with an overall 5 - year survival rate of < 10 % . Therefore , it is urgently required to develop novel diagnostic tools for detection of cancer at a much earlier stage and to develop molecular - targeted therapies such as small - molecular compound and immunotherapies targeting cancer - specific molecules . Gene expression profile of SCLC is the first step to identify the appropriate candidate molecules for such purposes . To analyze the gene expression profile of SCLC , we used genome - wide cDNA microarray consisting of 32 , 256 cDNA clones in combination with laser - micro - dissection technology to represent the expression profile of a highly pure population of SCLC cells . To our knowledge , this is the first report of comprehensive gene expression profiles of pure SCLC cells derived from laser - microdissected clinical tissue samples . Through the detailed genome - wide expression data of 32 , 256 genes , we identified 252 transcripts that were commonly up - regulated in SCLCs . These genes encode proteins with a variety of functions that include transmembrane / secretory proteins , and cancer - testis or onco - fetal antigens as well as proteins important in cell adhesion , cytoskeleton structure , signal transduction , and cell proliferation . Some of them should be useful as diagnostic / prognostic markers and probably as therapeutic targets for development of new molecular - targeted agents or immunotherapy for lung - cancer treatment . Tumor - specific transmembrane / secretory proteins should have significant advantages , because they are presented on the cell surface , making them easily accessible as molecular markers and therapeutic targets . Some tumor - specific markers available at present , such as CYFRA or Pro - GRP , are transmembrane / secretory proteins ( 19 , 24 ) . An example of rituximab ( Rituxan ) , a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20 - positive lymph - omas , provides proof of the concept that targeting specific cell - surface proteins can provide significant clinical benefits ( 25 ) . On the other hand , among tumor antigens identified to date , cancer - testis antigens ( CTAs ) have been recognized as a group of highly attractive targets for cancer vaccine . Although other factors , such as the in vivo immunogenicity of the protein are also important and further examination will be necessary , our candidate genes include known CTA such as TSGA14 . Further study using this expression profile will doubtlessly enable us to identify novel CTAs that could be a good target for immunotherapy of SCLC . Chemoresistance is clinically a very important issue that we need to overcome for an improvement in the treatment of patients with advanced or end - stage cancer . Our gene expression profile data obtained from the fifteen autopsy samples as well as advanced ADCs with the clinical history of chemotherapy ( Cluster - 2 in Fig . 3A and C ; Table IIB ) were considered to reflect the characteristics of advanced lung cancers with acquired chemoresistance . Unsupervised cluster analysis of these subgroups identified up - regulated genes including TAF5L , TFCP2L4 , PHF20 , LMO4 , TCF20 , and RFX2 that were known to have transcription factor activities . Some transcription factors were reported to be associated with acquired chemoresistance . For example , constitutive activation of NF - κ B , a transcription factor involved in multiple cellular processes , appears to support cancer cell survival and to reduce the sensitivity against chemotherapeutic drugs ( 26 ) . On the other hand , some genes in the list , i . e . C9orf76 , EHD3 , and GIMAP4 , were found to bind to the nucleotide . Since some DNA - binding proteins were known to play a critical role in the DNA - repair process , the genes shown above might also have some functions in DNA repair and contribute to increase in chemoresistance . Further analysis of the genes in this group might be important for the development of novel therapies for chemoresistant tumors . Neuroendocrine tumors of the lung range from well - differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma ( typical carcinoid ) to intermediate grade ( atypical carcinoma ) or to very aggressive poorly differentiated lesions ( large cell neuroendocrine carcin - oma ( LCNEC ) and SCLC ) . SCLC is generally considered as a major neuroendocrine tumor of the lung , and causes several paraneoplastic neuroendocrine syndromes . These syndromes represent clinically distinct symptoms in SCLC patients . Up - regulated genes included several genes which were related to the neuroendocrine function such as insulinoma - associated 1 ( INSM1 ) , chromogranin A ( parathyroid secretory protein 1 ; CHGA ) , and achaete - scute complex - like 1 ( Drosophila ; ASCL1 ) , further supporting the strong relationship between SCLC and neuroendocrine syndromes at molecular levels . Our gene list might also include a set of genes related to some cancer - related syndromes including cachexia . In conclusion , our cDNA microarray analysis combined with an LMM system revealed most comprehensive gene expression profiles of SCLC involving up - regulated genes that encode proteins with the function of cell cycle / growth , and signal transduction , or products with unknown function as well as transmembrane / secretory proteins and CTAs . The information could offer a powerful strategy for rapid identification and further evaluation of target molecules for a personalized therapy .
