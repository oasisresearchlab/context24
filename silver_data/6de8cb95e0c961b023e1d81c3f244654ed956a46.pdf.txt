Mueller Institute for Structural Biology , Biozentrum , University of Basel , CH - 4056 Basel , Switzerland Submitted July 20 , 2005 ; Revised August 25 , 2005 ; Accepted August 26 , 2005 Monitoring Editor : Thomas Pollard Within the past two years , actin has been implicated in eukaryotic gene transcription by all three classes of RNA polymerase . Moreover , within just the past year , actin has been identiﬁed as a constituent of ﬁlaments attached to the nuclear pore complexes and extending into the nucleus . This review summarizes these and other very recent advances in the nuclear actin ﬁeld and emphasizes the key present issues . On the one hand , we are confronted with a body of evidence for a role of actin in gene transcription but with no known structural basis ; on the other hand , there is now evidence for polymeric actin—not likely in the classical F - actin conformation—in the nuclear periphery with no known function . In addition , numerous proteins that interact with either G - or F - actin are increasingly being detected in the nucleus , suggesting that both monomeric and oligomeric or polymeric forms of actin are at play and raising the possibility that the equilibrium between them , perhaps differentially regulated at various intranuclear sites , may be a major determinant of nuclear function . INTRODUCTION Actin and myosin were ﬁrst discovered as actomyosin by Kuhne in 1861 , but it was not until 1939 – 1942 that actin itself was isolated by Straub , Bonga and Szent - Gyorgyi , and my - osin was discovered to be an ATPase by Engelhardt and Lyobimova ( Szent - Gyorgyi , 2004 ) . By the 1970s , the presence of actin and myosin in nonmuscle cells had been ﬁrmly established ( Hatano and Oosawa , 1966 ; Adelman and Tay - lor , 1969a , b ; Ishikawa et al . , 1969 ; Pollard et al . , 1970 ; Weihing and Korn , 1971 ; Pollard and Korn , 1973 ; Lazarides and We - ber , 1974 ; Garrels and Gibson , 1976 ) , and although their localization was mainly cytoplasmic , numerous subsequent observations suggested the existence of nuclear actin and myosin as well . Recently , we and others have reviewed the nuclear actin ﬁeld ( Pederson and Aebi , 2002 ; Olave et al . , 2002 ; Shumaker et al . , 2003 ; Bettinger et al . , 2004 ; Blessing et al . , 2004 ) . The two key questions have been “in what form” and “what for” ? Particularly signiﬁcant progress has been made in just the past year or so , and thus it is already time to assess these new developments and ask whether a coher - ent picture is now coming into view . ACTIN AND mRNA TRANSCRIPTION The ﬁrst solid evidence for a link between actin and gene transcription came from experiments in which actin antibod - ies or actin - binding proteins were injected into the germinal vesicle of salamander oocytes , resulting in a retraction of nascent RNA on the lateral loops of the meiotic ( “lamp - brush” ) chromosomes ( Scheer et al . , 1984 ) . These investiga - tors also reported the formation of a perichromosomal meshwork of ﬁlaments when transcription was inhibited by actinomycin and suggested that these ﬁlaments were actin , based on their observed fragmentation by the F - actin - sever - ing protein fragmin . Although the Scheer et al . article had a degree of impact , it did not generate a following in the eukaryotic transcription ﬁeld . Ironically , at just the same time there was a beacon from a major transcription labora - tory hinting at actin as an important factor ( Egly et al . , 1984 ) , but this ﬁnding , too , was also largely ignored . It is sobering to note that virtually all of the experimental systems and biochemical knowledge of transcription that have very re - cently been used to deﬁnitively implicate actin were avail - able in 1984 . As often happens , it was a paradigm shift that was needed , not the development of new technology . Al - though a number of key advances in the nuclear actin ﬁeld occurred after 1984 ( Olave et al . , 2002 ; Pederson and Aebi , 2002 ) , it was 17 years before the issue was investigated in further depth . This time , the concept took hold . In 2001 , actin was found to be associated with the Balbiani ring 2 nascent pre - mRNA in Chironomus salivary gland poly - tene chromosomes ( Percipalle et al . , 2001 ) , and soon there - after the same group reported that actin also forms com - plexes with the pre - mRNA binding hnRNP A - and B - type proteins ( Percipalle et al . , 2002 ) . Subsequently this group provided evidence that the role of actin in stimulating or sustaining pre - mRNA transcription requires its interaction with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein ( hnRNP ) pro - teins ( Percipalle et al . , 2003 ) . In short order , another study strongly implicated nuclear actin in RNA polymerase II transcription in growing mammalian cells ( Hofmann et al . , 2004 ) , indicating that a transcriptional role of actin is not limited to the meiosis - arrested amphibian oocyte ( Scheer et al . , 1984 ) or the insect larval polytene nucleus ( Percipalle et al . , 2001 , 2002 ; Percipalle et al . , 2003 ) , however implausible that hypothesis might have been . There have been numerous reports linking nuclear actin to the phenomenon of chromatin remodeling ( reviewed in Olave et al . , 2002 ) , although there has not been uniform This article was published online ahead of print in MBC in Press ( http : / / www . molbiolcell . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1091 / mbc .

A recent investigation in the aforementioned Chironomus system has now added further evidence for a connection among nuclear actin , chromatin remodeling , and RNA polymerase II transcription ( Sjo¨linder et al . , 2005 . ) In this study , it was found a peptide that inhibits the actin - nascent pre - mRNP association was counteracted by trichostatin A , which inhibits histone deacetylation . Ad - ditional experiments revealed that both actin and the pre - mRNP protein hrp65 are complexed in situ with the histone H3 - speciﬁc acetyltransferase p2D10 and that disruption of the actin – hrp65 interaction causes release of p2D10 from Pol II - transcribing genes coincident with reduced H3 acetylation and diminished transcription . These new ﬁndings ( Sjo¨linder et al . , 2005 ) considerably bolster the notion of a link among nuclear actin , chromatin remodeling , and Pol II transcrip - tion—the connection between the latter two phenomena already well established . BEYOND mRNA SYNTHESIS : ACTIN IN RNA POLYMERASE I AND III TRANSCRIPTION By 2003 , most investigators of the nucleus had taken note of the growing evidence for a role of actin as well as a nucleus - speciﬁc isoform of myosin I in transcription by RNA poly - merase II ( Pederson and Aebi , 2002 ) . Then , in rapid succes - sion , two groups published evidence that actin is also involved in transcription by RNA polymerases I and III . Actin was found to be associated with puriﬁed Pol III and was also shown to be localized in vivo on a gene known to be transcribed by Pol III ( Hu et al . , 2004 ) . These investigators also reported experiments indicating that when Pol III is inactivated by a speciﬁc inhibitor , its associated actin is released and that the polymerase’s activity is restored when actin is added back ( Hu et al . , 2004 ) . At about the same time , evidence was gathered for an involvement of both actin and myosin I in Pol I transcription ( Fomproix and Percipalle , 2004 ; Philimonenko et al . , 2004 ) . Although Pol II and Pol III transcription takes place on extended chromosomes situated in the nucleoplasm , Pol I transcription occurs deep within the compact nucleolar structure . There is thus no simple large - scale architectural homology between the environment of Pol II - and III - tran - scribed genes on the one hand , and the setting of Pol I transcription on the other , and this suggests that the role of actin in transcription by all three polymerases is not related to some common element of nuclear organization . DOES ACTIN BIND A COMMON FACTOR DURING TRANSCRIPTION BY ALL THREE RNA POLYMERASES ? Because actin has now been implicated in transcription by all three RNA polymerases , it is obvious to consider an actin - binding target that is common to the respective tran - scription machineries . The actin - binding hnRNP A - and B - proteins ( Percipalle et al . , 2002 ) are unlikely candidates be - cause these only interact with Pol II transcripts . Actin has recently been reported to bind to the C - terminal domain ( CTD ) of the largest subunit of Pol II ( Kukalev et al . , 2005 ) , but this domain is not present in any of the subunits of Pol I or Pol III . In Pol III transcription , actin was observed to bind directly to three of the enzyme’s 17 subunits ( when tested individually ) : RPC3 , RPABC2 , and RPABC3 ( Hu et al . , 2004 ) . Interestingly , the latter two are common to all three polymerases . In this regard , it is to be borne in mind that the actin - binding properties of the individual subunits of Pol I have not been examined and that in the recent Pol II study the experiments focused on the interaction of actin solely with the hyperphosphorylated CTD of the largest subunit . In addition , it is to be noted that the actin interactions with the polymerases I and II were observed to be inﬂuenced by other transcription - related proteins : the Pol I initiation factor TIF - 1A ( Philimonenko et al . , 2004 ) , and the hnRNP U protein in the case of Pol II ( Kukalev et al . , 2005 ) . Remaining before us are mechanistic issues such as the speciﬁc step or steps of transcription in which actin is involved , presently looking like at least elongation in the case of Pol II ( Percipalle et al . , 2003 ; Kukalev et al . , 2005 ; although see Hofmann et al . , 2004 ) and the identity of the actin - interactive proteins such as hnRNP U that collaborate with actin in transcription . WHAT LIES BENEATH ? ACTIN INSIDE THE NUCLEAR ENVELOPE The studies that implicated actin in gene transcription did not focus on the form of actin that is involved . It had long been known that the nucleus ( germinal vesicle ) of amphib - ian oocytes contains unpolymerized actin at a level very close to the critical concentration for polymerization ( (cid:1) 0 . 1 (cid:1) M ; Clark and Merriam , 1977 ; Gounon and Karsenti , 1981 ) . Whether the nucleus of these oocytes , or any other nuclei , contain some polymerized form of actin—not necessarily in the F - actin conformation—in the living state , amid a vast ocean of monomeric actin , had been long pondered . In early 2004 , ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy ( EM ) evidence was published for distinct actin and protein 4 . 1 containing nuclear “pore - linked ﬁlaments” ( PLFs ) that are attached to the nuclear pore complexes of Xenopus oo - cytes and extend into the nucleus ( Kiseleva et al . , 2004 ) . These investigators demonstrated that these PLFs collapsed upon exposure of the oocytes to the actin ﬁlament depoly - merizing agent latrunculin A . In contrast , jasplakinolide , which stabilizes preexisting actin ﬁlaments ( Lee et al . , 1998 ) and can also induce actin polymerization ( Spector et al . , 1999 ) , produced PLFs with a more open substructure . Im - munogold EM of oocyte nuclei revealed that actin and pro - tein 4 . 1 each localized on PLFs . Whereas the actin - gold epitopes were irregularly spaced along PLFs , the protein 4 . 1 - gold epitopes were spaced at (cid:1) 120 - nm intervals and were often paired ( (cid:1) 70 nm apart ) at ﬁlament junctions . Together , these observations make it rather unlikely that the backbone of PLFs , exhibiting a typical thickness of 40 nm ( range , 12 – 100 nm ) , is made of F - actin ﬁlaments . Thus , it is plausible that PLFs are heterotypic . The p270 / Tpr protein has previously been identiﬁed as a constitutive component of pore complex - attached intranuclear ﬁlaments ( Cordes et al . , 1997 ) , and preliminary immunogold labeling studies ( cited in Kiseleva et al . , 2004 ) also suggest that PLFs are speciﬁcally labeled by antibodies directed against a Tpr - related epitope . Last but not least , the Kiseleva et al . images also suggested that some of these PLFs might interact with more internally located nucleoplasmic structures involved in gene transcription ( i . e . , Cajal bodies and snurposomes ; vide infra . ) It is also noteworthy that just before the Kiseleva et al . study , actin and protein 4 . 1 had been colocalized in the nucleus of ( detergent extracted ) human ﬁbroblasts by im - muno - EM ( Krause et al . , 2003 ) , although the intranuclear location of these sites relative to the nuclear envelope was not reported . NUCLEAR ACTIN “RODS” Nuclear actin “rods , ” “bundles , ” and “tubules” have been described by a number of investigators ( Fukui and Kat - T . Pederson and U . Aebi Molecular Biology of the Cell 5056 sumaru , 1979 ; Iida et al . , 1986 ; Iida and Yahara , 1986 ; Nishida et al . , 1987 ; Wada et al . , 1998 ) , but their supramolecular organization has remained elusive except for one case ( Sameshima et al . , 2001 ) . These investigators have described a new type of actin rods formed both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of Dictyostelium discoideum that have been impli - cated in the maintenance of dormancy and viability at the spore stage of the developmental cycle . Examination of their ultrastructure has revealed these actin rods as bundles of hexagonally packed actin tubules consisting of three actin ﬁlaments each . In several instances , coﬁlin seems to be a major compo - nent of intranuclear actin rods ( Nishida et al . , 1987 ; Wada et al . , 1998 ; Aizawa et al . , 1999 ) . Moreover , because it has been shown that Exp6 mediates export of nuclear actin in a com - plex with proﬁlin ( Stuven et al . , 2003 ) , it would be important to determine whether proﬁlin is in fact a component of the intranuclear actin bundles . In this context , proﬁlin has been observed in mammalian cell Cajal bodies and interchroma - tin granule clusters ( Skare et al . , 2003 ) , the latter constituting the mammalian homologues of amphibian oocyte snurpo - somes . In addition , actin has been reported to partially co - localize with Cajal bodies ( Gedge et al . , 2005 ) , and actin has also been implicated in mRNA export from the nucleus ( Hofmann et al . , 2001 ; Kimura et al . , 2000 ) . The discovery of actin - containing ﬁlaments attached to the nuclear envelope ( Kiseleva et al . , 2004 ) together with other recent ﬁndings ( Dahl et al . , 2004 ; Holaska et al . , 2004 ; Libotte et al . , 2005 ) are beginning to raise the possibility that there is a perinucleo - plasmic , infranuclear envelope “cortex” of actin that dynam - ically interacts with the nuclear lamina and nuclear pore complexes and that plays a critical role in molecular export from the nucleus or nucleocytoplasmic interactions . Here , too , it is ( very ) early days , particularly when it comes to the question as to the form that this putative nuclear actin cortex assumes in terms of actin conformation , oligomerization , and / or polymer formation . DISTINCT ANTIGENIC SIGNATURES OF NUCLEAR VERSUS CYTOPLASMIC ACTIN At the time of our previous review ( Pederson and Aebi , 2002 ) , there was some evidence that nuclear actin exhibited epitopes that are “shielded” in cytoplasmic actin and vice versa , such that they differentially react with a monoclonal anti - actin antibody ( Gonsior et al . , 1999 ) . The hypothesis that nuclear actin ( or some fraction of the nuclear actin ) pos - sesses a distinct immunological signature , and therefore pre - sumably a distinct conformation and / or oligomeric / poly - meric state , has been supported in a recent study in which two monoclonal anti - actin antibodies were compared whose reactivities provide evidence that more than one conforma - tion of actin is present in the nucleus of mammalian cells ( Scho¨nenberger , Buchmeier , Sutterlin , Aebi , and Jockush , personal communication of unpublished results ) . Also to be borne in mind is the possibility that the nuclear and cyto - plasmic populations of actin in a given cell are distinct isoforms of the protein . Vertebrate genomes contain multi - ple genes encoding distinct isoforms of nonmuscle ( non - (cid:2) ) - actin ( Engel et al . , 1982 ; Pollard , 2001 ) and it is certainly possible that the major nuclear and cytoplasmic populations differ in amino acid sequence . The fact that actin dynami - cally exchanges between the nucleus and cytoplasm in Xe - nopus oocytes ( Clark and Merriam , 1977 ) does not exclude the possibility of a second isoform being more nuclear re - stricted . We may recall here that at least in vitro , actin can form supramolecular assemblies that are different from the classical F - actin ﬁlament ( e . g . , Millonig et al . , 1988 ; Steinmetz et al . , 1997 ; Schoenenberger et al . , 2002 ) . In fact , these assem - blies are built from an actin dimer ( the so - called “lower dimer” based on its migration in nondenaturing gel electro - phoresis ) that assumes a conformation distinct from that of F - actin ( Bubb et al . , 2002 ; Reutzel et al . , 2004 ) . ARE THERE OTHER ROLES FOR NUCLEAR ACTIN ? A recent study has revealed that herpesvirus particles are transported within the nucleus of infected cells by a spatially directed process that is dependent on metabolic energy and blocked by the alleged myosin - targeting inhibitor 2 , 3 - bu - tanedione dioxime ( BDM ) and also by latrunculin - A ( Forest et al . , 2005 ) . The facts that BDM is no longer accepted as a speciﬁc myosin inhibitor and that viral transport within the nucleus was insensitive to actin depolymerization mediated by cytochalasin D weaken the authors’ conclusion . How - ever , that the transport was spatially directed and depen - dent on metabolic energy were convincingly demonstrated and certainly suggest a ﬁlament - based transport process . These ﬁndings take on added interest in view of the fact that several studies have revealed that host cell proteins and RNAs move within the nucleus of mammalian cells by a diffusion - driven process ( Politz et al . , 1999 , 2003 ; Politz and Pederson , 2000 ; Misteli , 2001 ; Shav - Tal et al . , 2004 ) , indicat - ing that the intranuclear transport of herpesvirus capsids may be an exception . Yet another recent investigation has demonstrated a role for actin polymerization in chromosome capture and meta - phase congression during activation of meiosis I in large oocytes in which spatial considerations had raised the pos - sibility of a nonmicrotubule - based mechanism ( Lenart et al . , 2005 ) . Although this is a most intriguing new ﬁnding , it is not yet clear ( despite the article’s title ) whether the actin that participates in this phenomenon is intranuclear before nu - clear envelope breakdown . The starﬁsh oocytes used in this study are arrested at prophase and have intact nuclear en - velopes before activation so it is possible that the participat - ing actin is initially cytoplasmic and moves into the former nuclear zone , in either an unpolymerized or polymerized state , after nuclear envelope breakdown . This caveat in no way reduces the signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings but simply leaves open the question of whether this is a role of nuclear actin sensu stricto . In another recent study a role of actin was uncovered in meiotic telomere clustering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Trelles - Sticken et al . , 2005 . ) This actin - based telo - mere clustering produces a chromosomal “bouquet” at the at the leptotene - zygotene transition . Because this stage of meiosis precedes nuclear envelope disassembly , this re - cently described role of actin in telomere clustering consti - tutes an intranuclear phenomenon . ACTIN - BINDING PROTEINS IN THE NUCLEUS A rather large number of actin - binding proteins has now been identiﬁed in the nucleus of various cells , summarized in Table 1 . These are to be contrasted with nuclear actin - related proteins , or arps , which have been reviewed in detail recently ( Blessing et al . , 2004 ) and are not discussed further here . As can be seen , the reported nuclear actin - binding proteins include ones that classically bind to either G - or F - actin , but in no case has the form of nuclear actin bound by these proteins been unequivocally established . It is also to be noted that some of the entries in Table 1 bind actin rather weakly , e . g . , the protein 4 . 1 – actin interaction has a dissoci - ation equilibrium constant in the millimolar range . The func - Actin in the Nucleus Vol . 16 , November 2005 5057 tions of these various nuclear actin - binding proteins have not been comprehensively studied in all cases , and those functions listed should be viewed as simply the current snapshot . WHAT DO WE MOST NEED TO KNOW NEXT ? There is presently no experimental evidence for the exis - tence of ﬁlamentous structures at sites of gene transcription , notwithstanding controversial claims of an in vivo “nuclear matrix , ” which did not invoke actin in any case ( Pederson , 1998 , 2002 ) . Nevertheless , a recent study suggests that nu - clear actin might be a determinant in the partitioning of certain proteins between the soluble or residual fraction when nuclei are extracted to produce the nuclear matrix biochemical fraction ( Andrin and Hendzel , 2004 ) . A major issue then is to deﬁne the stoichiometry and molecular organization of actin at sites of gene transcription . One possibility is that to perform its role in gene transcrip - tion , actin assembles into some sort of unconventional oli - gomeric or polymeric structure that has not yet been ob - served in ultrastructural studies of active genes . The ﬁnding that ( presumably monomeric ) actin forms complexes with hnRNP proteins ( Percipalle et al . , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 ; Kukalev et al . , 2005 ) suggests that numerous actin subunits might be brought into proximity along a single nascent Pol II tran - script , a situation possibly conducive to promoting a tem - plate - mediated actin polymerization process yielding con - ventional F - actin ﬁlaments or perhaps an unconventional form of actin , such as the lower dimer , for example ( Millonig et al . , 1988 ; Steinmetz et al . , 1997 ; Bubb et al . , 2002 ; Schoenen - berger et al . , 2002 ; Reutzel et al . , 2004 ) . The second area in which much more needs to be learned is how actin interacts with all three transcription machiner - ies . This includes both the many subunits of all three poly - merases , already well done for Pol III ( Hu et al . , 2004 ) , and the many transcription factors and other accessory proteins for each polymerase . At the least , this may help to deﬁne how actin works in each case , and , at the most optimistic , such studies may reveal common features that will provide a fundamental insight as to how this ancient protein has collaborated with gene transcription during eukaryotic evo - lution . The third frontier concerns the PLFs ( Kiseleva et al . , 2004 ) as well as nuclear actin rods . Their existence in other cell types needs to be scrutinized and their molecular architec - ture must be dissected . The elegantly studied Chironomus BR2 mRNP ( Daneholt , 1999 ) would seem to be a perfect system for investigating this issue , hopefully capturing tem - poral events just before the remarkable nuclear pore transits of this RNP already captured ( Stevens and Swift , 1966 ; Daneholt , 1999 ) .
