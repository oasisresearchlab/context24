Meyers , MD , PhD c Buruliulcer ( BU ) , thethirdmostcommonmycobac - terial infection in humans next to tuberculosis and leprosy , is an emerging infection caused by Myco - bacterium ulcerans . BU is characterized by indo - lent , typically painless necrotizing skin lesions ( Figs . 1 and 2 A ) . Approximately 10 % of patients developboneinvolvementsubjacenttoskinlesionsormetastaticosteomyelitisfromlymphohematog - enous spread of M ulcerans ( see Fig . 2 B ) . Patho - genesis is mediated by mycolactone , a diffusible , necrotizing , immunosuppressive , polyketide - derived macrolide toxin secreted by M ulcerans . 1 In 1962 , the disease was named after Buruli County , Uganda , now called Nakasongola District , where the epidemic was documented first . Other names include Bairnsdale , Kakerifu , Kasongo , or Searls’ ulcer . EPIDEMIOLOGY In 1998 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) recognized BU as a reemerging infectious disease in West and Central Africa , with a significant public health impact . 2 The reported incidence rates of BU are highest in West Africa , especially Benin , Ghana , and Coˆte d’Ivoire . However , BU is re - ported in about 30 countries ( Fig . 3 ) , and growing evidence suggests that BU is more widespread than earlier thought . 3 BU prevails in rural tropical wetlands , especially areas with stagnant water , including ponds and swamps . However , BU is also acquired without wetland exposure . The rapid reemergence of BU , beginning in the early 1980s , particularly in areas where people are engaged in manual agriculture in wetlands , may be attributable to the man - made alterations to the environment , such as deforestation and other topographic alterations , which increase the amount of wetlands . Changes in global tempera - ture and precipitation patterns further promote the reemergence of BU . The WHO reports indicate that more than 5000 people are diagnosed with BU annually , but many cases are undiagnosed because of the geopolitical and socioeconomic factors in endemic countries . Children ( 5 e 15 years old ) have the highest incidence of BU , with most lesions on the lower extremities . BU is a growing Disclosure : The authors have nothing to disclose .

Up to 60 % of patients with BU suffer from disabling and stigmatizing sequelae , including scarring , contractures , and bone destruction . 4 Minimizing disability through treatment , both anti - microbial and surgical , and physiotherapy is , therefore , important in BU management . Imported BU is occasionally diagnosed in the United States , Canada , and Europe . 5 BU is directly related to environmental factors and thus considered noncontagious . 6 The most possible mode of transmission is local , minor , often unnoticed skin trauma that permits inoculation of M ulcerans . The estimated incubation period is 2 to 3 months . Because M ulcerans DNA is detectable in some aquatic insects , the role of insects as vectors that infect humans by biting is under investigation . 7 In Australia , some investigators propose that BU is a zoonosis transmitted by mosquitoes from indige - nous marsupials ( eg , possums and koalas ) to hu - mans . M ulcerans DNA was found in mosquitoes during an outbreak of BU in humans in Australia , and the seasonal incidence of BU in humans corre - lates with that of notifiable arthropod - borne diseases in Victoria . 8 In Africa , terrestrial mammals are being investigated as reservoirs of M ulcerans . 9 Risk factors for BU within endemic areas include failure to wear protective clothing , exposure to unprotected natural water sources , and inade - quate care of minor skin wounds . 10 , 11 Human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity may increase the risk for BU or be associated with aggressive BU . 12 BCG vaccination has some effect on BU . Several reports suggest that BCG vaccination provides someprotectionagainst BU , for6to12monthsafter vaccination , and that neonatal BCG vaccination reduces the risk of BU osteomyelitis in those who acquire BU as children or adults . 13 e 15 However , a case - control study concluded that BCG vaccina - tion is not protective against BU . 16 Prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines based on DNA engi - neering and virulence factors , including mycolac - tone , are under study ( BuruliVac Project ) . 17 Intravenous immunoglobulin to neutralize mycolac - tone is not available . MICROBIOLOGY OF M ULCERANS Standard and real - time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) techniques have been used to identify M ul - cerans , primarily by detecting 2 M ulcerans insertion sequences ( IS 2404 and IS 2606 ) , in the environment in Australia and West Africa . 18 Improved M ulcerans DNA extraction procedures enhance environmental Fig . 1 .

Walsh et al 2 detection , thereby advancing the understanding of reservoirs . 19 Portaels and colleagues 20 reported the first direct isolation of M ulcerans from nature in 2008 from a water strider , an aquatic insect that does not bite humans . Unlike M leprae and M tuberculosis ( the patho - gens for leprosy and tuberculosis , respectively ) , M ulcerans produces a necrotizing , immunosup - pressive , polyketide - derived macrolide toxin , called mycolactone . 1 Genes in a virulence plasmid of M ulcerans , controlled by SigA - like promoters , 21 encode for the synthesis of mycolactone . Identifi - cation of SigA - like promoters led to the develop - ment of M ulcerans e green fluorescent protein . This tagged protein linking fluorescence with toxin gene expression is a potential tool for studying BU pathogenesis and transmission . 21 M ulcerans shares some environmental , molec - ular , and clinical features with M marinum , a water - associated organism that causes granulo - matous skin lesions in humans , often called “swimming pool” or “fish tank” granuloma . Comparative genomics indicate that M ulcerans likely diverged from M marinum , acquiring a 174 - kb virulence plasmid ( pMUM001 ) with genes coding for mycolactone production and 10 proteins , all potential targets for vaccine develop - ment or serodiagnosis . 22 Accordingly , phenolic mycosides of M ulcerans and M marinum are identical , and sequences for the 16S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) gene are nearly identical . 6 As M ulcerans evolved toward becoming an intracellular organism , like M marinum , nonessential genes were lost , which may have increased the pathogenicity . 22 Gene sequences of the 3 0 end of the 16S rRNA of M ulcerans vary by geographic origin , dividing M ulcerans broadly into African , American , Asian , and Australian strains , with many substrains on each continent . 23 Each major strain generally differs in clinical presentation , mycolactone type and virulence , and host immune responses . 24 Mycolactone type coding by geographic origin includes A / B ( Africa , the most pathogenic ) , C ( Asia , Australia ) , and D ( Asia ) . 1 Molecular genetic techniques areslowly unravel - ing the evolution of M ulcerans . M ulcerans isolates from localized foci within endemic regions often show a high degree of genomic similarity ( ie , clonal populations ) with a lack of insertional - deletional genomic polymorphisms , underscoring a require - ment for single - nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) analysis to differentiate substrains of M ulcerans within those areas . 25 Identifying SNPs and estab - lishing SNP typing assays are increasingly defining the microepidemiology , genetic diversity , and evolution of M ulcerans . 26 , 27 For example , SNP analyses of M ulcerans in Ghana differentiate 54 Fig . 3 . Distribution of BU by country , as of 2010 . Relative endemicity is denoted as high ( red ) , moderate ( yellow ) , and low ( green ) ; asterisks denote countries with suspected cases . Imported BU is occasionally diagnosed in the United States , Canada , and Europe . Mycobacterium ulcerans Infection 3 M ulcerans strains into 13 SNP haplotypes , yet a geographically focal transmission . 27 , 28 PATHOGENESIS AND IMMUNITY Initial infection is primarily related to 2 properties of M ulcerans : optimal growth at temperatures ( 30 (cid:3) C e 33 (cid:3) C ) slightly below the core body temper - ature and production of mycolactone . The temper - ature requirement of M ulcerans favors the development of lesions in cooler tissues , espe - cially the skin and subcutaneous tissue . Mycolac - tone destroys tissues by apoptosis and necrosis ( Fig . 4 ) and suppresses host immune responses . 1 Mycolactone profoundly suppresses elements of innate and adaptive cell - mediated immunity , thereby enhancing progression of BU . Mycolac - tone inhibits macrophages , monocytes , B cells , and T cells at least , in part , by inhibiting production of interleukin ( IL ) - 1 , IL - 2 , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , IL - 10 , tumor necrosis factor a , and interferon - g ( IFN - g ) . 29 , 30 The immunosuppressive effects of mycolactone extend beyond skin lesions to circulating leuko - cytes and lymphoid organs . 31 Peripheral whole - blood samples from patients with active BU , when stimulated with mitogens , produce compar - atively smaller amounts of helper T cell ( T H ) 1 , T H 2 , and T H 17 cytokines . 32 The clinical and histopathologic features of BU suggest an immunologic spectrum of host responses over time , which may be relevant for vaccine strategies . Early progressive ulcers generate abundant IL - 10 with little inflammation ( T H 2 response ) and numerous , often extracellular , M ulcerans ( Fig . 5 ) within areas of coagulation necrosis . Necrosis reflects mycolactone - induced death of tissue and inflammatory cells . In contrast , mature or resolving BU lesions , especially under treatment with antibiotics , contain IFN - g within granulomatous inflammation , organizing lymphoid aggregates , and typically intracellular M ulcerans , consistent with a T H 1 , delayed - type hypersensi - tivity ( DTH ) response . 1 , 33 , 34 DTH in these patients , but not those with early BU or uninfected persons , is verified by skin test reactivity against burulin , a sonicate of M ulcerans . 35 Minor BU may self - heal early , suggesting elements of high host resistance . CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS BU presents as a spectrum of localized or dissemi - nated clinical forms , with variable natural history ( Fig . 6 ) . Early lesions are usually papular , nodular , or edematous , progressing to ulcers with rolled borders , spreading laterally . Most ulcers are pain - less unless secondarily infected . Fever and lymph - adenopathy are rare . Experienced workers may Fig . 4 . Microscopic section of the undermined edge of a major BU . Note contiguous coagulation necrosis of the panniculus and fascia and vasculitis with throm - bosis of a medium - sized vessel ( arrow ) ( hematoxylin - eosin , original magnification (cid:4) 40 ) . A mild host inflammatory response is consistent with a toxin - mediated process . Fig . 5 . Microscopic section of early nodule of BU showing clumps of extracellular acid - fast bacilli ( AFB , red ) in the center of widespread necrosis ( Ziehl - Neelsen stain , original magnification (cid:4) 40 ) . Necrosis extends far beyond the AFB , supporting the notion that M ulcerans produces a diffusible necro - tizing toxin . Fig . 6 . Proposed classification and natural history of untreated clinical forms of active BU . Walsh et al 4 correctly diagnose some BU lesions on clinical features alone , but there is often discord between clinical impression and laboratory results because ofincorrectclinicaldiagnosis , inadequatesampling , or laboratory errors . Important entities in the differ - ential diagnosis of ulcerative and edematous BU include tropical phagedenic ulcer and necrotizing fasciitis , respectively . 36 Both these conditions , unlike BU , are painful . Many other conditions resemble BU , underscoring the importance of labo - ratory confirmation . Radiographic examination is indicated when bone involvement is suspected . The 4 diagnostic laboratory tests for BU are ( 1 ) direct smear ( with acid - fast stains auramine O or Ziehl - Neelsen ) , ( 2 ) culture , ( 3 ) histopathology , and ( 4 ) PCR . Estimated sensitivities for these tech - niques range from 60 % or lesser to more than 90 % . PCR , currently available only in research laboratories , is considered the most reliable method for all lesion subtypes , 37 followed by histo - pathology , culture , and direct smear . Lesion sampling techniques include swabbing , punch biopsy , and , as a less - invasive alternative to biopsy , fine - needle aspiration ( FNA ) . PCR is highly sensitive when applied to swabbed material from ulcers and to biopsies and FNAs of nonulcerative lesions . 38 The targets of PCR , IS 2404 and IS 2606 , may be present in other pathogenic mycobacteria , such as M marinum ; so clinical features or variable number of tandem repeat assays may discriminate M ulcerans from other species . 39 Among the non - PCR diagnostic methods , histo - pathology is useful to confirm BU or generate a differential diagnosis when unconfirmed . Culture is recommended for tracking treatment response , often a concern in clinical trials . 38 Pharmacologic assays to detect mycolactone in the tissues in - fected with M ulcerans may become a diagnostic adjunct to culture . 40 Direct smears are useful at the community level . Rapid diagnostic tests for use in the field , to detect mycolactone or M ulcer - ans e specific proteins in lesional or other biologic fluids , are in early development . Regardless of the test or sampling method , at least 2 sites per lesion suspicious for BU should be sampled ; this process increases sensitivity over a single sample by up to 25 % . When con - fronted with possible new geographic foci of BU , confirmation by PCR and at least 1 of the other 3 tests is advised . TREATMENT Historically , treatment of BU has been surgical excision of the affected tissues , correction of wound defects , and , if available , rehabilitative physiotherapy . Bone and joint lesions are given priority . By the 1970s , rifampin was known to heal most small BU lesions . However , until 2005 , antibiotics remained a largely perioperative adjunctive therapy , aimed at reducing dissemina - tion and recurrence or minimizing tissue exci - sion . 41 The role of adjunctive antibiotic therapy for BU that is otherwise surgically excised remains unclear . 42 Other treatment methods , such as local heat , explored decades ago , may become prac - tical as application systems are simplified . 43 In 2004 , with increasing BU incidence and limited surgical resources in Africa , supported by experimental and encouraging preliminary human data , 44 the WHO advocated a provisional antibiotic regimen for BU , comprising oral rifampin ( 10 mg / kg ) plus intramuscular strepto - mycin ( 15 mg / kg ) , both given daily for 8 weeks under supervision . 45 Amikacin ( 15 mg / kg ) can be substituted for streptomycin , administered intra - muscularly or intravenously . Important contraindi - cations and side effects for these drugs are described elsewhere . 45 As general guidelines , patients with lesions less than 5 cm in diameter ( category I , small ) receive antibiotics alone and those with lesions 5 to 15 cm in diameter ( cate - gory II , moderate ) receive 4 weeks of antibiotics and then undergo surgery , if necessary , followed by 4 more weeks of antibiotics . Patients with lesions more than 15 cm in diameter ( category III , advanced ) are treated with antibiotics for at least 1 week before surgery ; the antibiotics are then continued for a total of 8 weeks . Follow - up of all patients is advised for an additional 10 months to assess for cure and complications . Case series studies of rifampin plus strepto - mycin for small and moderate BU conducted in Benin and Ghana concluded that most lesions resolve after 8 weeks of treatment . 46 , 47 In 2010 , Nienhuis and colleagues 48 reported the first randomized trial of rifampin plus streptomycin for early limited BU , defined as lesions of less than 6 months’ duration comprising nodules or ulcers less than 10 cm in diameter . Rifampin plus strepto - mycin given daily for 8 weeks , or for 4 weeks , fol - lowed by rifampin plus clarithromycin ( both oral ) daily for 4 weeks , all without surgery , healed BU in more than 90 % of patients by 1 year . These results , coupled with experimental data in mice and a case report describing resolution of advanced BU after 8 weeks of rifampin plus clarithromycin , 49 support studies of fully oral , less - toxic regimens , such as rifampin plus clari - thromycin or rifapentine plus moxifloxacin . 50 For advanced BU , rifampin plus streptomycin therapy is under investigation . In a study in the Democratic Republic of Congo , 61 patients with Mycobacterium ulcerans Infection 5 PCR - positive ulcers ( longest diameter > 10 cm ) were treated with daily rifampin plus streptomycin , treatment was extended to 12 weeks , and surgery was performed 4 weeks after antibiotics treatment was begun ; 98 % were classified as cured after 2 years . 51 Further studies in patients with large BU lesions , coordinated by the WHO , will aim to deter - mine the best time for surgery within the course of antibiotics . In some BU lesions , treatment with antibiotics may cause temporary immune - mediated inflam - mation with clinical worsening , proposed as a par - adoxic sign of treatment success . 52 Awareness may prevent unnecessary treatment changes , reduce surgeries , and improve the accuracy of treatment trials .
