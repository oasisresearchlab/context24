Train travel is a common mode of public transport across the globe ; however , the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) transmission among individual train passengers remains unclear . Methods . We quantified the transmission risk of COVID - 19 on high - speed train passengers using data from 2334 index patients and 72 093 close contacts who had co - travel times of 0 – 8 hours from 19 December 2019 through 6 March 2020 in China . We ana - lyzed the spatial and temporal distribution of COVID - 19 transmission among train passengers to elucidate the associations between infection , spatial distance , and co - travel time . Results . The attack rate in train passengers on seats within a distance of 3 rows and 5 columns of the index patient varied from 0 to 10 . 3 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 5 . 3 % – 19 . 0 % ) , with a mean of 0 . 32 % ( 95 % CI , . 29 % – . 37 % ) . Passengers in seats on the same row ( including the adjacent passengers to the index patient ) as the index patient had an average attack rate of 1 . 5 % ( 95 % CI , 1 . 3 % – 1 . 8 % ) , higher than that in other rows ( 0 . 14 % [ 95 % CI , . 11 % – . 17 % ] ) , with a relative risk ( RR ) of 11 . 2 ( 95 % CI , 8 . 6 – 14 . 6 ) . Travelers adjacent to the index patient had the highest attack rate ( 3 . 5 % [ 95 % CI , 2 . 9 % – 4 . 3 % ] ) of COVID - 19 infection ( RR , 18 . 0 [ 95 % CI , 13 . 9 – 23 . 4 ] ) among all seats . The attack rate decreased with increasing distance , but increased with increasing co - travel time . The attack rate increased on average by 0 . 15 % ( P = . 005 ) per hour of co - travel ; for passengers in adjacent seats , this increase was 1 . 3 % ( P = . 008 ) , the highest among all seats considered . Conclusions . COVID - 19 has a high transmission risk among train passengers , but this risk shows significant differences with co - travel time and seat location . During disease outbreaks , when traveling on public transportation in confined spaces such as trains , measures should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission , including increasing seat distance , reducing passenger density , and use of personal hygiene protection . Keywords . COVID - 19 ; SARS - CoV - 2 ; train ; co - travel time ; spatial distance . Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) was first identified in Wuhan , China , in early December 2019 [ 1 ] , with a subsequent spread across the globe . Population movements within and be - tween regions and countries play a key role in seeding the virus and accelerating COVID - 19 spread [ 2 – 5 ] . For instance , the large - scale travel during the Lunar New Year holiday facilitated the transmission of COVID - 19 in China [ 6 , 7 ] . Meanwhile , cases related to domestic and international travel have been reported in many countries , such as Canada , France , and the United States [ 8 – 11 ] . Based on air travel data , studies have assessed the risk of potential international spread of the disease in the early stages [ 5 , 7 , 12 ] . Additionally , significant correlations were found between case numbers and the volume of domestic trans - portation , including flights , trains , and buses [ 13 , 14 ] . Travel re - strictions and social distancing measures have been introduced across countries to contain or mitigate COVID - 19 transmission [ 15 , 16 ] . However , only meta - population - level transportation data and models were used in those studies to measure the po - tential risk of seeding the virus between locations [ 17 – 20 ] , and how COVID - 19 transmits between individual travelers on spe - cific transportation modes remains unknown . Trains are one of the most common and important modes of transportation in many countries , especially in European and Asian countries . In China , the high - speed train ( G train ) car - ried an estimated 2 billon passengers in 2018 , which is 3 . 3 times the number the passengers carried by airplanes . Additionally , the G train is the most widely used train in China , transporting more passengers than any other type of train and accounting for > 60 % of the country’s rail passengers [ 21 , 22 ] . The 2020 Lunar New Year travel season in China started on 10 January 2020 , at D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / c i d / a r t i c l e / 72 / 4 / 604 / 5877944 b y N a t i ona l S c i en c e and T e c hno l og y L i b r a r y - R oo t u s e r on 17 F eb r ua r y 2021 Risk of COVID - 19 Transmission During Train Travel • cid 2021 : 72 ( 15 February ) • 605 the early stage of the COVID - 19 outbreak . Approximately 150 million passengers traveled by train across China [ 23 ] from 10 January through 23 January 2020 , when the Chinese govern - ment imposed a full lockdown on Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province . At least 1058 persons with COVID - 19 might have traveled by train before Wuhan’s lockdown [ 24 ] . However , the risk and relevant factors of COVID - 19 transmission among train passengers remain unclear . Using itinerary data from anonymous passengers who were later diagnosed as COVID - 19 cases and their close contacts on G trains during the outbreak from December 2019 through March 2020 in China , we attempted to quantify the individual - level risk of COVID - 19 transmission during travel . We investigated the at - tack risk of COVID - 19 in train travelers as well as the correlations between the risk of infection and seat locations , spatial distance , and travel duration on trains . Findings from our study provide improved evidence to tailor intervention strategies to reduce the risk of COVID - 19 transmission during travel . METHODS Data Sources Epidemiological investigations of COVID - 19 cases and their close contacts were conducted by the Chinese and local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in China . We included a total of 2568 confirmed cases who reported having traveled be - tween 19 December 2019 and 6 March 2020 by G train across mainland China within the preceding 14 days before or during illness onset . Dates of symptom onset and diagnosis were avail - able for cases . A close contact was defined as a person who had co - traveled on a train within a 3 - row seat distance of a con - firmed case ( index patient ) within 14 days before symptom onset [ 25 ] . For this study , seat information ( including seat number and names of departure and destination stations ) of cases and close contacts were obtained from the China State Railway Group ( www . china - railway . com . cn ) . Railway timetables were queried from the China railway - booking website ( www . 12306 . cn ) to calculate travel time between each pair of departure and destination stations . Considering that the incubation pe - riod of COVID - 19 is up to 14 days , the G train travel records were restricted to before 25 February 2020 . Based on the date of symptom onset , finally , 2334 train passengers were included as index patients in different coaches , while 234 passengers among 72 093 close contacts , whose seat was within the distance of 3 rows to an index patient , have been subsequently confirmed as secondary COVID - 19 cases . Data Analysis Based on the close contact data , we calculated COVID - 19 attack rates by different seat locations referring to the seat occupied by an index patient on a train , accounting for the effect of co - travel time ( Figure 1 ) . For each coach , the case with the earliest date of onset was considered as an index patient in that coach . The attack rate for each seat between 19 December 2019 and 6 March 2020 was defined as the number of passengers on this seat who were diagnosed as COVID - 19 cases , divided by the total number of pas - sengers who were on the same seat and travel with index patients in a coach . Wilson binomial 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated for each point estimate of the attack rate . Two variables , spatial distance and co - travel time on train , were selected as potential determinants of transmission risk . Spatial dis - tance between an index patient and each close contact was meas - ured as a row and column number – based difference from the index patient’s seat . A seat is approximately 0 . 5 meter in width . The dis - tance between adjacent rows is approximate 0 . 4 meter . The aisle between the seat C and the seat D was counted as a seat when we calculated the column distance between seats . Co - travel time for an index patient and each close contact was calculated based on travel time between the shared departure and destination stations . Relative risk ( RR ) and χ 2 test were used to compare the attack rate between different seats . The spatial statistical index Moran I was used to measure the global spatial autocorrelation of the attack rates of Figure 1 . Distribution of second - class seats in a typical high - speed train coach .

A Moran I value approximating 1 . 0 indicates spatial clus - tering , whereas a value approximating −1 . 0 indicates spatial disper - sion . The Wang q index was applied to compare the differences in attack rates between rows and columns of seats [ 27 , 28 ] . A q value approximating 1 . 0 indicates a completely stratified heterogeneity of risk between regions , whereas a q value approximating 0 . 0 indicates weakly stratified heterogeneity . We also split the close contacts into 2 groups according to whether they had the same departure and des - tination stations as the index patients , and compared the attack rates between them . The first group contained the close contacts who had the same departure and destination stations with the index patients ; otherwise , the close contacts belonged to the second group . We per - formed all the analyses in R software , version 3 . 6 . 3 ( R Foundation for Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) . Ethics Approval The collection and analysis of case and close contact data were deter - mined by the National Health Commission of China to investigate and control the COVID - 19 outbreak . This study was exempt from an institutional review board approval , and participant consent was not required . All data were supplied and analyzed in an anonymous format , without access to personal identifying information . RESULTS Overall Attack Rate Co - travel time varied from 0 . 13 to 13 . 8 hours with a mean of 2 . 1 hours ( standard deviation , 1 . 8 ) , and 99 . 2 % of travel times were < 8 hours . The overall attack rate of COVID - 19 in train passengers with close contact with index patients was 0 . 32 % ( 234 / 72 093 ; 95 % CI , . 29 % – . 37 % ) . The average attack rates of passengers per seat from A to F in each row as presented in Figure 1 with co - travel time < 8 hours were as follows : A ( window seat ) , 0 . 28 % ( 41 / 14 394 ; 95 % CI , . 21 % – . 39 % ) ; B ( middle seat ) , 0 . 41 % ( 51 / 12 496 ; 95 % CI , . 31 % – . 54 % ) ; C ( aisle seat ) , 0 . 34 % ( 48 / 14 147 ; 95 % CI , . 26 % – . 45 % ) ; D ( aisle seat ) , 0 . 34 % ( 51 / 14 921 ; 95 % CI , . 26 % – . 45 % ) ; and F ( window seat ) , 0 . 27 % ( 43 / 16 135 ; 95 % CI , . 20 % – . 36 % ) , respectively . However , there was no significant difference among them ( P = . 26 ) . Considering the spatial distance and co - travel time on train , the attack rate varied significantly from 0 to 10 . 3 % ( 8 / 78 ; 95 % CI , 5 . 3 % – 19 . 0 % ) ( Figure 2 ) . Moran I index of the spatial dis - tribution of attack rate within 1 - hour co - travel time was 0 . 25 ( P = . 003 ) , which decreased to 0 . 13 ( P = . 053 ) when the co - travel time was < 3 hours ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Additionally , the index increased rapidly and reached a maximum value of 0 . 38 ( P = . 003 ) at 7 hours . The q index was 0 . 89 ( P = . 001 ) , taking the row number and hourly co - travel time as the unit of stratification . The attack rate of COVID - 19 among train passengers who immediately used the seats used previously occupied by index patients was 0 . 075 % ( 1 / 1342 ; 95 % CI , . 004 % – . 42 % ) . It had no significant difference with the average attack rate ( 12 / 16751 ; 0 . 072 % [ 95 % CI , . 04 % – . 13 % ] ) of the passengers who immedi - ately used the seats within the distance of 3 rows and 5 columns to the seat used by index patients in the same routes . Effect of Spatial Distance on Attack Rate The average attack rate differed between rows ( P < . 001 ) . Passengers on seats within the same row as the index patient had Figure 2 .

However , there was no significant difference ( P = . 36 ) in transmission risk be - tween seats that were 1 and 2 rows apart . Although seats that were 3 rows apart were at risk of COVID - 19 transmission , this attack rate was approximately half of the risk of infection at seats that were 1 and 2 rows apart ( Figure 3 ) . Passengers on seats adjacent to an index patient had the highest attack rate at 3 . 5 % ( 92 / 2605 ; 95 % CI , 2 . 9 % – 4 . 3 % ) , which was > 2 times higher than that in the second most exposed seat and > 10 times higher than the minimum rate within the same row . Compared to other seats , the seat adjacent to the patient was at high risk of infection ( RR , 18 . 0 [ 95 % CI , 13 . 9 – 23 . 4 ] ) . The average attack rate for all rows decreased rapidly with an increase in the number of columns between them . For seats within the same row as the index patient , when the number of columns was < 4 , the attack rate decreased by 1 . 6 % ( P = . 067 ; 90 % CI , . 5 % – 2 . 7 % ) per every column added . The average at - tack rate for all rows and for the seat within the same row as the index patient had a quadratic relationship to the number of columns from the index patient . The lowest attack rate was found for seats 4 columns apart for both curves ( Figure 3 ) . For the average result across all rows , the minimum rate of 0 . 12 % ( 14 / 11 570 ; 95 % CI , . 07 % – . 20 % ) was less than one - fifth of the maximum rate ( RR , 5 . 6 [ 95 % CI , 3 . 2 – 9 . 7 ] ) . In contrast to the seats within the same row as the index patient , for the seats that were a single row apart , there was a linear relationship between the attack rate and the number of columns . On average , the attack rate decreased by 0 . 045 % ( 95 % CI , . 018 % – . 071 % ; P = . 009 ) for every column of distance added . For the seats that were 2 rows apart from the index patient , there was a linear relationship between the attack rate and the number of columns ; however , it was not significant ( Figure 3 ) . Effect of Co - travel Time on Attack Rate For all seats , the correlation between COVID - 19 attack rate and the duration of co - traveling with an index patient followed a quadratic relationship ( Figure 4 ) . The average attack rate in - creased by 0 . 15 % ( P = . 005 ) per hour of co - travel . From the quadratic fitted curve , the slope was larger when the co - travel time extended beyond 4 hours . However , the attack rate by seat location had a different relationship with co - travel time . A linear relationship was found for both adjacent seats and seats that were 3 rows apart , whereas a quadratic relationship was found for the other seats . For the adjacent seats , 1 additional hour co - travel with the index patient resulted in up to 1 . 26 % ( P = . 008 ) increase in the attack rate , which was the highest among all considered seats , followed by other seats in the same row , with a rate increase of 0 . 26 % ( P = . 004 ) , and then seats 1 , 2 , and 3 rows away with rate increase of 0 . 10 % ( P = . 068 ) , 0 . 09 % ( P = . 063 ) , and 0 . 04 % ( P = . 039 ) , respectively . The average attack rate for all considered seats in the first group ( 194 / 21008 ; 0 . 92 % [ 95 % CI , . 80 % – . 11 % ] ) was signifi - cantly higher ( P < . 01 ) than that in the second group ( 33 / 50816 ; 0 . 06 % [ 95 % CI , . 05 % – . 09 % ] ) ( Supplementary Figures S2 and S3 ) . In the first group , the attack rate increased significantly ( P = . 05 ) with the increase of co - travel time , but this was not the case in the second group . Additionally , the attack rate in the second group had no significant difference ( P = . 71 ) with that of the passengers who immediately used the seats previously occu - pied by index patients ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) . DISCUSSION Revealing the risk of COVID - 19 infection at the individual level for travelers has important public health implications for under - standing the transmission mechanism and prevention of COVID - 19 on public transportation ( such as trains ) . Our study is the first to quantify the risk of COVID - 19 transmission in public transporta - tion based on data from epidemiological investigations of COVID - 19 cases and close contacts on high - speed trains . We also found that the COVID - 19 attack rate among train passengers is related to the spatial distance and co - travel time on train , and the attack rate distribution across seats within 3 rows and 5 columns of an index patient is heterogeneous . The risk of being infected is much higher in the seats within the same row as the index patient than in the seats in other rows . There are several possible reasons for the heterogeneity of attack rate in train passengers . First , family members or friends who traveled together might stay in adjacent seats and have Table 1 .

The numbers in parentheses are the 95 % confidence interval of the attack rate .

Second , passengers within the same row might be easily infected by each other because , during a long journey , they tend to leave their seat for a drink , to go to the washroom , or simply to move around and relax . When a pas - senger leaves a window or middle seat , the other passengers in the row need to let them pass , potentially increasing close face - to - face contact . Viruses attached on aerosols and droplets are also more likely to spread at close range [ 29 ] . Third , the backrests that separate rows might be a good barrier to slow the spread of virus - laden aerosols [ 30 , 31 ] . The difference of attack rates between the 2 groups might be because passengers from the first group had a higher con - tact rate with nearby passengers / patients due to family mem - bers , friends , or even just strangers but shared same workplace / hometown anecdotes . In contrast , passengers from the second Figure 3 . Relationships between coronavirus disease 2019 attack rate and rows apart from the index patients . Figure 4 .

Additionally , restricting the interval of seat reuses , disinfecting the seat , and improving hand hygiene may help re - duce the risk of transmission . Therefore , social distancing is an important method of reducing the risk of disease transmission on public transportation [ 32 , 33 ] . The allocation of passenger seats on a train should be carefully con - sidered to reduce the risk of disease transmission . Given the attack rates estimated for passengers on the seats within the same row as the index patient , it follows that within 1 hour spent together , the safe social distance is > 1 meter . After 2 hours of contact , a distance of < 2 . 5 meters can be insufficient to prevent transmission . To pre - vent COVID - 19 spread during an outbreak , the recommended distance is at least 2 seats apart within the same row , with travel time limited to 3 hours . Our findings also highlight that passengers in confined spaces such as on a train , airplane , or bus might need to improve personal hand hygiene and use protective equipment ( eg , wearing a facemask ) . Increasing ventilation of fresh air , circulation , and filtration would be also helpful to reduce the risk of transmis - sion among passengers . Additionally , the screening of passengers’ temperature before boarding could be carried out to minimize the risk of infection . This study was based on several assumptions , and there are some methodological limitations that should be con - sidered when interpreting its findings . First , the spatial extent of transmission in our analysis was limited to 7 rows ( about 6 meters ) —that is , 3 rows back and 3 rows ahead , plus the index row—but a longer distance of transmission might have occurred within the same coach . Second , although individ - uals with confirmed cases of COVID - 19 had traveled on the train within 14 days of diagnosis , passengers infected with COVID - 19 after their journey would result in an overesti - mate of attack rate on the train , as the exact times of infection were not available . Third , passengers and train crews might also spread the virus when they moved around on the train , and passengers could have also changed their seats during the journey . Due to the availability of data , however , we could not include these factors in our study . Last , family members or friends of passengers might transmit viruses to each other before and after travel through close contact . As we cannot obtain data on social relationships and home or work loca - tions among passengers to eliminate these potential biases , the risk of transmission on the train could be overestimated in our analysis . Nevertheless , the presented results provide an upper estimate of the attack rate on a high - speed train . Additionally , the study considered exclusively spatial dis - tance and co - travel time , but it did not account for individual characteristics such as demographic features , medical history , personal hygiene behavior , or wearing of protective gear . All of these might also affect the rate of transmission and should be examined in future research . In conclusion , using a large dataset of cases and contacts of train passengers , the present epidemiological and modeling analysis has explicitly measured the spatial and temporal dis - tribution of COVID - 19 attack rate and relevant risk factors for high - speed train passengers . Our findings can help inform policy on travel duration , seat allocation , and personal protec - tive behavior to reduce the spread risk of COVID - 19 for coun - tries with community transmission , and to prevent resurgence for countries preparing to relax travel and social distancing interventions and reopen their economies .
