LETTER doi : 10 . 1038 / nature09692 A unique chromatin signature uncovers early developmental enhancers in humans Alvaro Rada - Iglesias 1 , Ruchi Bajpai 1 , Tomek Swigut 1 , Samantha A . Brugmann 1 , Ryan A . Flynn 1 & Joanna Wysocka 1 , 2 Cell - fate transitions involve the integration of genomic informa - tion encoded by regulatory elements , such as enhancers , with the cellular environment 1 , 2 . However , identification of genomic sequences that control human embryonic development represents a formidable challenge 3 . Here we show that in human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) , unique chromatin signatures identify two dis - tinct classes of genomic elements , both of which are marked by the presence of chromatin regulators p300 and BRG1 , monomethyla - tion of histone H3 at lysine 4 ( H3K4me1 ) , and low nucleosomal density . In addition , elements of the first class are distinguished by the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 ( H3K27ac ) , overlap with previously characterized hESC enhancers , and are located proxi - mally to genes expressed in hESCs and the epiblast . In contrast , elements of the second class , which we term ‘poised enhancers’ , are distinguished by the absence of H3K27ac , enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation ( H3K27me3 ) , and are linked to genes inactive in hESCs and instead are involved in orchestrating early steps in embryogenesis , such as gastrulation , mesoderm formation and neurulation . Consistent with the poised identity , during dif - ferentiation of hESCs to neuroepithelium , a neuroectoderm - specific subset of poised enhancers acquires a chromatin signature associated with active enhancers . When assayed in zebrafish embryos , poised enhancers are able to direct cell - type and stage - specific expression characteristic of their proximal developmental gene , even in the absence of sequence conservation in the fish genome . Our data demonstrate that early developmental enhancers are epigenetically pre - marked in hESCs and indicate an unappre - ciated role of H3K27me3 at distal regulatory elements . Moreover , the wealth of new regulatory sequences identified here provides an invaluable resource for studies and isolation of transient , rare cell populations representing early stages of human embryogenesis . Recent reports demonstrated that active enhancers can be iden - tified by epigenomic profiling of p300 ( ref . 4 ) , H3K4me1 and H3K27ac 5 , 6 . To characterize the enhancer repertoire of hESCs we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to massively par - allel DNA sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) using antibodies recognizing chro - matin regulators ( that is , p300 , BRG1 ) and histone modifications ( that is , H3K4me1 , H3K27ac , H3K4me3 , H3K27me3 ) that distinguish dis - tal elements from proximal promoters 5 , 6 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . As expected , previously characterized hESC enhancers ( for example , NANOG ( ref . 7 ) and OCT4 ( also called POU5F1 ) 8 ) were bound by p300 and flanked by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac marked chromatin , but were not enriched for H3K27me3 or H3K4me3 ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . Genome - wide analysis defined 5 , 118 geno - mic regions ( hereafter referred to as class I elements ) marked by a similar chromatin signature ( that is , high p300 , H3K4me1 and H3K27ac , low , if any , H3K4me3 , and absence of H3K27me3 ) , repre - senting putative active hESC enhancers ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Data 1 ) . Interestingly , in the vicinity of many early developmental genes we noted promoter - distal p300 - bound regions that were marked by H3K4me1 but , in contrast to the active hESC enhancers , lacked H3K27ac and were instead enriched for H3K27me3 , a modification associated with polycomb silencing 9 ( Fig . 1a ) . Overall , we identified 2 , 287 p300 - bound regions devoid of H3K27ac and marked by H3K27me3 , which we will hereafter refer to as class II elements ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Data 1 ) . In general , class II elements showed enrichment of both H3K27me3 and H3K4me1 flanking p300 peaks ( Fig . 1b ) . In contrast , analysis of previously described adult tissue - specific enhancers 10 – 13 revealed no enrichment for any of the interrogated modifications ( Supplementary Fig . 2b – e ) . p300 enrichment levels were comparable at class I and II elements ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) , both classes were bound by BRG1 ( Sup - plementary Fig . 3b ) , and showed similar genomic distribution relative to annotated transcription start sites ( TSS ) , with over 95 % of regions located away from promoters ( Fig . 1c ) . Moreover , only 1 . 7 % and 3 . 9 % of class I and class II elements , respectively , overlapped with CpG islands , in sharp contrast to the 50 % overlap observed for promoters . Another property of enhancers is their relative nucleosomal depletion comparedtotheflankingregions 14 , 15 . UsingFAIRE - seq ( formaldehyde - assisted isolation of regulatory elements 16 coupled to sequencing ) we showed that class I and II elements were comparably nucleosome - depleted ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . Furthermore , examination of a reported DNA - methylation - sensitive restriction enzyme data set from hESCs 17 revealed similar levels of DNA hypomethylation at class I and class II elements ( Supplementary Fig . 3d ) . ChIP - seq results were validated by ChIP - qPCR at a representative subset of class I and class II elements ( labelled with the name of their closestgene ) ( SupplementaryFigs 4a – dand5 ) . Furtherexaminationof theH3K27acandH3K27me3enrichmentsshowedamutuallyexclusivemarkingpatternatclassIandclassIIelements ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Sequential ChIP - qPCR demonstrated a simultaneous presence of H3K4me1 / K27ac at class I regions , and H3K4me1 / K27me3 at class II regions , indicating that the concurrent enrichments of H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 were not due to cell population heterogeneity ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Moreover , consistent with H3K27me3 , we observed enrichment of the PRC2 component , SUZ12 , at class II elements ( Supplementary Fig . 4e ) . We also detected preferential association of RNA POL2 with class I elements , as compared to class II elements , including its unphosphory - lated , Ser5 phosphorylated and Ser 2 phosphorylated forms ( Sup - plementary Fig . 7a – c ) . Next we asked whether transcriptional status of nearby genes differs between the two classes . To this end , we analysed hESC transcriptome by RNA - seq and examined transcripts originating from TSS closest to the elements of each class . Class - I - associated gene expression was sig - nificantly higher than expression of all genes , or of class - II - associated genes , which were poorly expressed ( Fig . 2c ) . In agreement , class - II - associated TSS were enriched for both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 , whereas class - I - associated TSS were marked by high H3K4me3 levels ( Supplementary Fig . 8a , c ) . Thus , the two classes defined by unique chromatin signatures are also distinguished by the transcriptional status of associated genes . 1 DepartmentofChemicalandSystemsBiology , StanfordUniversitySchoolofMedicine , Stanford , California94305 , USA . 2 DepartmentofDevelopmentalBiology , StanfordUniversitySchoolofMedicine , Stanford , California94305 , USA . 1 0 F E B R U A RY 2 0 1 1 | VO L 4 7 0 | N AT U R E | 2 7 9 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Taken together , our results suggest that class II elements represent poisedenhancers , whichrevealtheircell - type - dependentactivityduring development . One prediction from this hypothesis is that upon differ - entiation to a specific fate , a subset of poised enhancers linked to genes inducedinthisfateshouldacquireanactive , classIsignature . Totestthis prediction , we differentiated hESCs into neuroectodermal spheres ( hNECs ) 19 , generated p300 , H3K4me1 , H3K27ac and H3K27me3 pro - files by ChIP - seq , and identified genomic elements thatwere marked by class II signature in hESCs , but acquired a strong enrichment of H3K27ac in hNECs ( 195 unique regions , Supplementary Data 1 ) . Histone modification profiling over these regions showed concomitant decrease in H3K27me3 ( Fig . 3a , b and Supplementary Fig . 9a ) and we refertothemhereafterasclassII R Ielements . Ofnote , alargenumberof the remaining class II regions ( that is , those that did not acquire H3K27ac ) retained H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 signature in hNECs , but showed diminished p300 occupancy ( Supplementary Fig . 9b – d ) . The aforementioned observations were validated by ChIP - qPCR for a representative subset of enhancers ( Fig . 3c – e ) . We further showed that class II R I elements acquired RNA POL2 enrichment in hNECs , whereas hESC - specific active enhancers showed diminished RNA POL2 binding ( Supplementary Fig . 10a ) . In agreement with a report documentingshortbidirectionaltranscriptsoriginatingfromenhancers 20 , we detected an increased level of bidirectional transcription from class II R I elements upon differentiation to hNECs , whereas transcripts originating from NANOG and OCT4 enhancers were downregulated ( Supplementary Fig . 10b , c ) . 6 2 4 2 , 000 1 , 000 0 – 1 , 000 – 2 , 000 8 A v e r a g e p r o fi l e ( N E C ) Relative distance from p300 sites ( bp ) H3K4me1H3K27acH3K27me3 P O U 5 F 1 G B X 2 E O M E S N O D A L Z N F 423 T Y R O 3 F G F R 1 N A N O G C D 9 O P A 1 G P R 177 W N T 8 B F O X P 4 F O X A 2 N E G 1 F A M 49 A A R H G E F 17 N E G 2 N E G 3 ActiveESC Negative Class II C D H 2 PP A P 2 B S O X 1 G P R 19 E P H A 4 P e r ce n t a g e o f i n p u t 6 8 2 P e r ce n t a g e o f i n p u t 1 . 2 0 . 8 0 . 4 0 H3K4me1 H3K27me3 Activeboth Negative Class II Class II → I ( 195 ) 0 4 P e r ce n t a g e o f i n p u t 8 12 0 4 Class II → I Class II → I a b c d e P O U 5 F 1 G B X 2 E O M E S N O D A L Z N F 423 T Y R O 3 F G F R 1 N A N O G C D 9 O P A 1 G P R 177 W N T 8 B F O X P 4 F O X A 2 N E G 1 F A M 49 A A R H G E F 17 N E G 2 N E G 3 ActiveESC Negative Class II C D H 2 PP A P 2 B S O X 1 G P R 19 E P H A 4 P O U 5 F 1 G B X 2 E O M E S N O D A L Z N F 423 T Y R O 3 F G F R 1 N A N O G C D 9 O P A 1 G P R 177 W N T 8 B F O X P 4 F O X A 2 N E G 1 F A M 49 A A R H G E F 17 N E G 2 N E G 3 C D H 2 PP A P 2 B S O X 1 G P R 19 E P H A 4 Activeboth Class II → I 44 72695000 72700000 7270500010 kb 72710000 72715000 72720000 72725000 8 p300 ESC H3K4me1 ESC 52 4 4 30 430 4 H3K4me1 NEC H3K27ac ESC H3K27ac NEC 48 4 H3K27me3 ESC 48 4 H3K27me3 NEC Chr18 TSS ARHGEF17 Vertebratecons Class II → I 10 0 32 8 p300 NEC 44 All ( 36 , 693 ) Class II ( 1 , 795 ) E S C N E C E S C N E C E S C N E C P = 4 . 1×10 – 9 P = 1 . 6×10 – 2 R P K M 6 2 4 8 10 0 Class II → I ( 155 ) f Class I ( 4 , 381 ) E S C N E C 12 H3K27ac ActiveESC Activeboth Figure 3 | A subset of class II elements acquires active enhancer chromatin signatureuponneuroectodermaldifferentiation . a , AveragehNECChIP - seq signal profiles were generated for the indicated histone modifications around the central position of those p300 - bound regions ( as determined in hESC ) that acquired H3K27ac enrichment in hNECs ( that is , class II R I elements ) . b , Genome browser representation of p300 , H3K4me1 , H3K27ac and H3K27me3 ( in hESCs and hNECs ) binding profiles at a representative class II R I element .

All rights reserved ©2011 GREAT annotation of class II R I elements showed association with genes expressed in neuroectoderm and related to abnormalities in nervous system development ( Supplementary Fig . 11 and Supplemen - tary Data 4 ) . In agreement , hNEC RNA - seq transcriptome analysis revealed significant upregulation of class - II R I - associated genes upon differentiation , whereas expression of the remaining class - II - associated genes was persistently low ( Fig . 3f ) . Moreover , H3K27me3 levels at class - II R I - associated TSS were diminished and H3K4me3 levels induced in hNECs as compared to hESCs , whereas modification pro - files over TSS associated with the remaining class II elements were relatively unchanged ( Supplementary Fig . 8b , d ) . To examine if upon differentiation class II R I elements acquire the ability to drive gene expression , we infected hESCs with lentiviruses encoding a green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) reporter under the control of select class II R I ( for example , SOX2 , HES1 ) , class I ( for example , CD9 , JARID2 ) and class II elements ( for example , EOMES , MYF5 ) and monitored GFP fluorescence at day 1 , 5 and 7 of differentiation to hNECs ( Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . Class II R I reporters showed low , if any , fluorescence levels in hESCs , but were induced at day 5 of differentiation , whereas class I reporters displayed a reverse pattern . Our results are consistent with class II elements representing poised developmental enhancers , which upon differentiationacquire , ina cell - type - dependentmanner , the properties of active enhancers . To test whether class II elements indeed function as developmental enhancers , weexaminedtheiractivityduringembryogenesis . Sequence conservation analysis revealed that class II elements are evolutionarily constrained and display a higher degree of conservation than class I elements ( Supplementary Fig . 13a ) . VISTA enhancer browser search 21 identified fourteen class II elements for which enhancer activity was previously assayed at embryonic day 11 . 5 of mouse development . In ninecases , highlyspecific expressionpatterns werenoted ( Supplemen - tary Table 2 ) . Interestingly , two enhancers ( WNT8B , CDH2 ) belong to the class II R I and , in agreement , drive gene expression specifically in neuroectoderm - derived structures in the mouse ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Next we screened enhancer activity of a select set of class II elements using zebrafish embryo transgenic reporter assay 22 , 23 . Selected elements correspond to previously uncharacterized human genomic sequences ( except for WNT8B ) that are located in proximity to genes whose zebrafish homologues have known expression patterns , although the elements themselves are generally not well conserved in the zebrafish genome ( Supplementary Figs 13 and 14 ) . GFP reporters were injected into one - cell - stage embryos and fluorescence was monitored through - out fish embryogenesis ( Supplementary Fig . 15 ) . For eight out of nine assayed class II reporters , specific and reproducible GFP patterns were observed at distinct developmental stages and anatomical locations ( Fig . 4a – f , Supplementary Fig . 14 and Supplementary Table 3 ) . A first subgroupofassayedelements ( forexample , NODAL , EOMES , LEFTY2 ) drove gastrulation - specific expression at the shield , the fish equivalent of mouse primitive groove ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . Although none of the three tested sequences is well conserved in fish , proximal genes NODAL , EOMES and LEFTY2 are conserved across vertebrates , with shield - specific expression pattern of zebrafish NODAL and LEFTY2 homologues 24 ( Supplementary Figs 14 and 16a ) . From mice to frogs , EOMES expression is initially restricted to the primitive groove and blastopore lip , respectively 25 , 26 , but the zebrafish EOMES homologue is only expressed at later stages ( ZFIN database , identifier ZDB - PUB - 051025 - 1 ) .

Poised developmental enhancers ( class II ) are marked by a unique chromatin signature , involving occupancy of chromatin modifiers p300 , BRG1 and PRC2 and nucleosomal regions marked by H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 . During differentiation , appropriate developmental and signalling cues are able to rapidly transition these poised , pre - marked enhancersinto an active state represented by theacquisition of H3K27ac , RNA POL2 binding , recruitment of tissue - specific transcription factors ( TFs ) and loss of H3K27me3 , leading to the establishment of tissue - specific gene expression patterns .

All rights reserved ©2011 indicating responsiveness of this human sequence to zebrafish gastru - lation circuitry . A second subgroup of class II reporters ( for example , SOX2 , NKX2 - 1 , EN1 , WNT8B , MIXL1 ) drove GFPexpression at later developmental stages ( 24 – 28 h post fertilization ( h . p . f . ) ) ( Fig . 4b – f ) ; this expression was restricted to specific anatomical structures such as the midbrain – hindbrain boundary ( EN1 ) 27 or theventral diencephalon / hypothalamus ( NKX2 - 1 ) 28 . Again , despite the low degree of sequence conservation in fish ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) , observed GFP patterns were generally consistent with the reported expression of the putative target gene homologues 24 , 29 ( Supplementary Fig . 16b – d ) . Importantly , specificity ofour results was validated withan extensive set of control regions , including : ( 1 ) five class I elements ; ( 2 ) four non - conserved genomic regions flanking select analysed class II elements ; ( 3 ) four human adult tissue - specific enhancers ; ( 4 ) three randomly selected intergenic non - conserved regions ; ( 5 ) empty vector ( Sup - plementary Table 4 ) . All control regions showed only weak , diffused and nonspecific GFP patterns from 6h . p . f . to 5d . p . f . ( Supplementary Figs 17 – 21 ) . It is worth mentioning that based on our limited analysis , classI elements active inhESCs donot appear todrivepre - specification expression in zebrafish . Finally , to address whether expression patterns driven byclassIIelements are dynamic , wemonitoredseveral reporters ( LEFTY2 , SOX2 , EN1 , NKX2 - 1 ) throughout embryogenesis for up to 5d . p . f . In all cases , GFP patterns were transient in nature , with fluor - escencesignalsbarelydetectableafter3d . p . f . ( SupplementaryFigs17 – 21 ) , further underscoring that class II regions represent dynamically regu - lated developmental enhancers . We uncovered a unique chromatin signature that bookmarks early developmental enhancers in pluripotent cells , likely to prime them for a response to signalling and developmental cues ( Fig . 4g ) . In addition to novel insights into gene regulation , our study identified a set of over 2 , 000 putative regulatory sequences , thereby creating an invaluable resource for lineage tracking and isolation of transient cell populations representing early steps of human development .

All rights reserved ©2011 METHODS hESCculture . hESCs ( H9line , Wi - Cell ) wereexpandedinfeeder - free , serum - free medium , mTESR - 1 from StemCell technologies . Cells were passaged 1 : 7 every 5 – 6days byincubation with accutase ( Invitrogen ) andresultant small cell clusters ( 50 – 200 cells ) were subsequently re - plated on tissue culture dishes coated over - night with growth - factor - reduced matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) . hESC quality was regularly tested by evaluating the expression of a panel of hESC markers ( for example , alkaline phosphatase , OCT4 ) and the capacity to differentiate into cell types derived from the three germ layers . Neuroectoderm cell ( NEC ) differentiation . hESCs were differentiated into hNECsusingapreviouslydescribeddifferentiationprotocol 21 . Briefly , hESCswere incubated with 2mgml 2 1 collagenase . Once detached , cells were plated in NEC differentiationmedia : 1 : 1neurobasalmedium / DMEMF - 12medium ( Invitrogen ) , 0 . 5 3 B - 27 supplement minus vitamin A ( 50 3 stock , Invitrogen ) , 0 . 5 3 N - 2 sup - plement ( 100 3 stock , Invitrogen ) , 20ngml 2 1 bFGF ( Peprotech ) , 20ngml 2 1 EGF ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 5 m gml 2 1 bovine insulin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 0 . 1 m gml 2 1 recom - binant human NOGGIN ( Peprotech ) , 1 3 Glutamax - I supplement ( 100 3 stock , Invitrogen ) . Cells were differentiated for 7days , changing media every other day . Chromatinimmunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) , sequentialChIP , FAIREandantibodies . ChIPassayswereperformedfromapproximately10 7 hESCsorhNECsperexperi - ment , according to previously described protocol with slight modifications 31 . Briefly , cells were crosslinked with 1 % formaldehyde for 10min at room temper - ature and formaldehyde was quenched by addition of glycine to a final concen - tration of 0 . 125M . Chromatin was sonicated to an average size of 0 . 5 – 2kb , using Bioruptor ( Diagenode ) . A total of 3 – 5 m g of antibody was added to the sonicated chromatinandincubated overnightat 4 u C . 10 % of chromatin used for each ChIP reaction was kept as input DNA . Subsequently , 75 m l of protein A or protein G Dynal magnetic beads ( depending of antibody species and Ig isotype ) were added to the ChIP reactions and incubated for four additional hours at 4 u C . Magnetic beadswerewashedandchromatineluted , followedbyreversalofthecrosslinkings and DNA purification . Resultant ChIP DNA was dissolved in water . Sequential ChIPs were performed as previously described with slight modifica - tions 32 . ChromatinwaspreparedasdescribedaboveforChIPandafteradditionof the first antibody ( 3 – 5 m g ) andcorresponding washes , magneticbeadswere resus - pended in 75 m l TE / 10mM DTT . Samples were diluted 20 times with dilution buffer ( 1 % TritonX - 100 , 2mMEDTA , 20mMTris - HClpH8 , 150mMNaCl ) and second antibody ( 3 – 5 m g ) was added to each reaction . Beads were then washed , crosslinking reversed and DNA purified and dissolved in water . For FAIRE , sonicated chromatin was prepared as for ChIP and DNA was extracted as previously described 16 All antibodies used in this study have been previously reported as suitable for ChIP : p300 ( sc - 585 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) 5 , BRG1 ( clone JA1 , a gift from G . Crabtree ) 33 , H3K4me1 ( ab8895 , Abcam ) 5 , H3K27ac ( ab4729 , Abcam ) 5 , H3K4me3 ( 39159 , Active Motif ) 34 , H3K27me3 ( 39536 , Active Motif ) 35 , RNA POL2 unpho - sphorylated ( 8WG16 clone , MMS - 126R , Covance ) 36 , RNA POL2 ser5P ( ab5131 , Abcam ) 37 , RNA POL2 ser2P ( ab5095 , Abcam ) 38 , normal rabbit IgG ( 12 - 370 , Millipore ) . ChIP - qPCR . AllprimersusedinqPCRanalysisareshowninSupplementaryData 5 . Primers are named after proximal putative target genes of the investigated enhancers . For each tested genomic element , two sets of primers were used , one set overlapping the peak of maximal p300 enrichment ( central primers ) and another set overlapping flanking regions with histone modification enrichments ( flanking primers ) . This strategy was used because p300 peaks typically occurred within nucleosome - poor regions . qPCR analysis was performed in a Light Cycler 480II machine ( Roche ) , using technical triplicates and ChIP - qPCR signals were calculated as percentage of input . Standard deviations were measured from the technical triplicate reactions and represented as error bars . RT - qPCR of enhancer RNAs . To assess levels of enhancer - associated transcrip - tion , total RNA from hESCs and hNECs differentiated for 7days was isolated using Trizol reagent followed by ethanol precipitation according to the manufac - ture’s protocol ( Invitrogen ) . To remove genomic DNA contaminants , the Turbo DNA - Free kit was used following rigorous DNase treatment ( two times , 30min incubations at 37 u C ) . cDNA was generated from 100ng of DNA - free RNA using the QuantiTech Reverse Transcription Kit ( Qiagen ) with two modifications : ( 1 ) The gDNA elimination reaction was extended for 5min and ( 2 ) the reverse tran - scription elongation time was 30min . Quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) primers were designed ( Supplementary Data 5 ) to target regions surrounding the p300 peaks that defined each tested enhancer . qPCR runs andanalysis were preformedonthe Light Cycler 480II machine ( Roche ) . To calculate fold change between the hESCs andhNECs , the DD C t methodwasusedandthe18SrRNAtranscriptswereusedas a loading control . Standard deviations were measured from technical triplicate reactions and were represented as error bars . Biological replicate experiments for hNECs were performed and very similar results were obtained ( data not shown ) . ChIP - seq . Libraries were prepared from : hESC and hNEC p300 ChIP , hESC BRG1 ChIP , hESC FAIRE , hESC and hNEC H3K4me3 ChIP , hESC and hNEC H3K4me1ChIPs , hESCandhNECH3K27me3ChIPs , hESCandhNECH3K27ac ChIPs , hESC and hNEC input DNAs . ChIP - seq , FAIRE - seq and input libraries were prepared according to Illumina protocol and sequenced using Illumina Genome Analyser . All sequences were mapped by ELAND software ( Illumina Inc . ) and analysed by QuEST 2 . 4 software 30 , 35 . ChIP - seq enrichment regions for the following profiled proteins were determined using the indicated settings , according to QuEST recommendations : hESC p300 : KDE ( kernel density estima - tion ) bandwidth 5 30 , ChIP seeding fold enrichment 5 30 , ChIP extension fold enrichment 5 3 , ChIP - to - background fold enrichment 5 3 ; hESC H3K4me3 : KDE bandwidth 5 60 , ChIP seeding fold enrichment 5 30 , ChIP extension fold enrichment 5 3 , ChIP - to - background fold enrichment 5 3 ; hESC H3K4me1 : KDE bandwidth 5 100 , ChIP seeding fold enrichment 5 10 , ChIP extension fold enrichment 5 3 , ChIP - to - background fold enrichment 5 2 . 5 ; hESC H3K27me3 : KDE bandwidth 5 100 , ChIP seeding fold enrichment 5 10 , ChIP extension fold enrichment 5 8 , ChIP - to - background fold enrichment 5 2 . 5 ; hESC and hNEC H3K27ac : KDE bandwidth 5 100 , ChIP seeding fold enrichment 5 10 , ChIP extension fold enrichment 5 3 , ChIP - to - background fold enrichment 5 2 . 5 . For all ChIP - seq data sets , WIG files were generated with QuEST , which were subsequently used for visualization purposes and for obtaining average signal profiles . RNA - seq . RNAs from hESCs and NECs were extracted with Trizol ( Invitrogen ) , followingthemanufacturer’srecommendations . 10 m goftotalRNAweresubjected to two rounds of oligo - dT purification using Dynal oligo - dT beads ( Invitrogen ) . 100ng of the purified RNA were fragmented with 10 3 fragmentation buffer ( Ambion ) . Fragmented RNA was used for first - strand cDNA synthesis , using random hexamer primers ( Invitrogen ) and SuperScript II enzyme ( Invitrogen ) . Second strand cDNA was obtained by adding RNaseH ( Invitrogen ) and DNA Pol I ( New England Biolabs ) to the first strand cDNA mix . The resulting double - strandedcDNAwasusedforIlluminalibrarypreparationasdescribedforChIP - seq experiments . RNA - seq libraries were sequenced with Illumina Genome Analyser and both mappingandanalysisofresultingreadswereperformedwithDNAnexussoftwaretools ( https : / / dnanexus . com ) . Reads per kilobase per million mapped reads ( RPKM ) were calculated for allhumanEnsembl genes . The specificity andquality of our RNA - seq data can be visualized at several hESC - or hNEC - specific genes ( Supplementary Fig . 22 ) . Class I and class II element selection criteria . ChIP - seq enrichment regions as determined by QuEST were used to define class I and class II elements ( Sup - plementary Data 1 ) . To this end , operations ( intersection , subtraction , and so on ) between genomic data sets were performed with GALAXY ( http : / / main . g2 . bx . psu . edu / ) and the following selection criteria were used : class I elements ( 5 , 518 regions ) : genomic regions with hESC p300 enrichment ( ChIP seeding fold enrichment . 30 ) , located within 2kb of regions enriched in hESC H3K4me1 and H3K27ac ( ChIP seeding fold enrichment . 10 for both modifications ) , and , to distinguish these elements from proximal promoters , we demanded that these regions do not overlap with hESC H3K4me3 ( ChIP seeding fold enrichment . 30 ) ; class II elements ( 2 , 287 regions ) : genomic regions with hESC p300 enrich - ment ( ChIPseedingfoldenrichment . 30 ) , locatedwithin2kbofregionsenriched in hESC H3K27me3 ( ChIP seeding fold enrichment . 8 ) . These regions were further required not to overlap with hESC H3K4me3 ( ChIP seeding fold enrich - ment . 30 ) or hESC H3K27ac ( ChIP seeding fold enrichment . 10 ) . Class II R I elements ( 195 regions ) : class II elements ( as determined in hESCs ) which in hNECs acquired enrichment in H3K27ac ( H3K27ac ChIP seeding fold enrich - ment . 10 , within 2 kb of p300 peaks defining class II elements ) . In total , we identified 11 , 543 regions marked by p300 and H3K4me1 in hESCs , ofwhich1 , 639didnotcontainH3K27ac , H3K27me3orH3K4me3enrichment . A total of 3 , 531 regions were enriched for p300 , H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 ( those generally corresponded to proximal promoters ) . Please note that although our definition of class II elements does not use an H3K4me1 enrichment filter , about 55 % of class II regions are enriched for H3K4me1 at ChIP seeding fold enrichment . 10 ; when lower cutoff is allowed , theoverlapissignificantlymoresubstantial . Thus , thevastmajority , ifnotall , class IIelementsprobablycontainsabove - backgroundlevelsofH3K4me1 , asexemplified by the observation that class II elements with ChIP - seq H3K4me1 levels below the seeding fold enrichment . 10 cutoff are still substantially enriched for H3K4me1 when assayed by ChIP - qPCR ( see Supplementary Fig . 5 , for example , CHD2 , EPHA4 , GPR19 , ADRA2A , KLF5 , EML1 regions ) . Other sequencing data analyses . Average ChIP - seq signal profiles around the centre of p300 - enriched regions were generated with the Sitepro tool , part of the Cistrome Analysis pipeline ( http : / / cistrome . dfci . harvard . edu / ap / ) , using the cor - responding WIG files generated with QuEST . Similarly , ChIP - seq signal profiles RESEARCH LETTER Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved ©2011 were generatedaround geneTSS . For genesassociated with thedifferentclasses of distalelements , eachelementwaslinkedtoitsclosestgene , basedonthedistanceto TSS , and considering a maximum distance of 100kb . Average PhastCons scores profiles around the centre of p300 - enriched regions were generated with the Conservation / Aggregate Datapoints tool , part of the Cistrome Analysis pipeline ( http : / / cistrome . dfci . harvard . edu / ap / ) . Distance between enhancersand their closest Ensembl geneTSSwascalculated usingPinkThingsoftware ( http : / / pinkthing . cmbi . ru . nl / ) andEnsembl52assembly . With thisinformation , itwaspossible tocalculate the overall genomicdistribution , basedondistancetoTSS , forthedifferentenhancergroupsandtoassignenhancers to their closest genes . Functional annotation of enhancers was obtained with GREAT ( http : / / great . stanford . edu / public / html / input . php ) , using the Basal plus extension association rules and the whole human genome as background . ForRNA - seqdataanalysis , eachenhancerwasassignedtoitsclosestgenebased ondistancetoTSSconsideringamaximumdistanceof100kb , resultinginvarious genegroups eachcorrespondingtoanenhancerclass ( forexample , classI , classII , class II R I ) . Statistical significance ( P - values ) of thedifference in expression levels between different gene groups was calculated using two - sample one - sided Wilcoxon - test ( R software , http : / / www . r - project . org ) . Paired or non - paired tests were performed when the same or different genes were compared , respectively . Box plots representing RPKM distribution were generated with R ( http : / / www . r - project . org ) . MRE - seq ( methylation - sensitive restriction enzyme ) data for hESCs was obtained from the GEO data set public repository under accession number GSM450236 . Invitroenhancer reporter assays in hESCs and hNECs . Representative class I , class II R I and class II elements ( Supplementary Table 1 ) were cloned into a lentiviral vector ( Sin - minTK - eGFP ) in front of a minimal TK promoter driving GFP expression . hESC colonies were transduced with the appropriate lentiviruses and GFP fluorescence levels were subsequently monitored in undifferentiated hESCs , as well as in the course of hNEC differentiation ( at day 1 , 5 and 7 after induction of differentiation ) . Zebrafish reporter assays . The biological relevance of the identified human enhancers was evaluated using Tol2 transposon - mediated transgenesis in zebra - fish 24 . Selected human enhancers were PCR amplified and cloned in the pT2HE vector ( giftfromD . M . Kingsley ) , upstreamofthe hsp70 promoterandeGFP . Tol2 transposase was in vitro transcribed using mMessage mMachine Sp6 kit ( Ambion ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . It is worth mentioning that the hsp70 promoter independently drives robust and stable expression in the lensafter28 – 38h . p . f . 39 . Thislenssignalisalsoobservedwhenadditionalsequences areplacedupstreamoftheminimal hsp70 promoter , actingasapositivecontrolfor correcttransgenesis . VectorDNA , withcorrespondingenhancers , andtransposase RNA were mixed and injected in one - cell - stage zebrafish embryos as previously described . eGFP expression patterns were typically monitored at three different developmental times : 6 – 8h . p . f . , 10 – 14h . p . f . and24 – 28 h . p . f . According to ref . 24 , using the described reporter assay method , 10 – 20 % of the injected embryos are expected to display consistent and representative expression patterns . Because 50 embryos were typically injected , expression patterns were considered as repres - entative for a given enhancer if displayed by at least 5 – 10 embryos within each batch ( the remaining embryos typically showed a nonspecific or lack of fluor - escence pattern ) . For those enhancers with identifiable and consistent expression patterns , a second set of injections ( biological replicate ) were performed for 50 additional embryos and in all cases similar results were obtained compared to the first injections . Initial monitoring and embryo imaging were performed with a Leica M205 FA fluorescentstereoscope . High - resolution images presented inFig . 4 were obtained with a Leica DM4500 B upright compound microscope . Althoughlive embryosweretypicallymonitoredandimaged , inordertoobtain flat whole - embryo images , selected embryos were fixed and the yolk removed . Briefly , 24 – 28h . p . f . embryos were dechorionated and transferred to 4 % para - formaldehyde solution in PBS . After overnight rocking at 4 u C , fixed embryos were washed and stored in methanol at 20 u C until ready to use . Specificity of our reporter assays was validated by assaying an extensive set of negative controls ( Supplementary Table 4 ) : ( 1 ) five class I elements ; ( 2 ) four non - conserved genomic regions in proximity of four of the tested class II elements ; ( 3 ) four human adult - tissue - specific enhancers that should not drive expression during early developmental stages ; ( 4 ) three randomly selected intergenic non - conserved regions ; ( 5 ) empty vector . In addition , four selected class II elements were followed up to 5days post - fertilization , together with their corresponding flanking non - conserved regions and additional negative controls . GFP patterns were monitored after 6h . p . f . , 24h . p . f . , 3d . p . f . and 5d . p . f . In these cases and for the class II elements , embryos showing specific patterns at the corresponding stage ( for example , 6h . p . f . for LEFTY2 and 24h . p . f . for SOX2 , EN1 and NKX2 - 1 ) were selected and their GFP patterns subsequently monitored .
