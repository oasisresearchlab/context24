We present a network model that uses socio - demographic datasets with the highest available 21 granularity to predict the spread of COVID - 19 in the province of Barcelona . The model is ﬂexible 22 enough to incorporate the effect of containment policies , such as lockdowns or the use of protec - 23 tive masks , and can be easily adapted to future epidemics . We follow a stochastic approach that 24 combines a compartmental model with detailed individual microdata from the population census , 25 including social determinants and age - dependent strata , and time - dependent mobility information . 26 We show that our model reproduces the dynamical features of the disease across two waves and 27 demonstrate its capability to become a powerful tool for simulating epidemic events . 28 2 .

Communities all over the world had to modify habits and 31 social contacts , in a common effort of erecting a barricade against the virus . Understanding the 32 virus , its structure and its dynamics , is of paramount importance not only for the development of 33 medical solutions ( vaccines and speciﬁc pharmacological therapies ) but also to deﬁne the social 34 strategy of prophylaxis and prevent the expansion of the pathology . 35 The contagious spread of COVID - 19 and the impact of mitigation strategies are currently 36 the subject of many studies , all of them pursuing a better understanding of the variables at stake 37 ( it is worth citing the progenitor studies by Imperial College London 1 , 2 and , in the particular 38 case of Catalonia , those conducted by the Computational Biology and Complex Systems group at 39 UPC 3 , 4 , 5 ; for further references see also the review by Estrada 6 ) . This is a complex problem 40 because it involves several factors acting simultaneously , with different weights and consequences , 41 and both short - and long - term effects . What we know for certain is that the disease propagates 42 mainly through social contacts 7 . It becomes then crucial to understand the pattern of contacts 43 of each individual – and how this is intertwined with demographic and social determinants – to 44 comprehend the natural history of COVID - 19 , as well as the speciﬁc attributes ( age , previous 45 medical conditions , etc ) that determine the outcome of the infection in each infected person 8 . 46 The frequencies and types of contacts are inﬂuenced by lockdown policies , while the probability 47 to become infected depends on individual protection measures . Additionally , the probability for 48 3 .

Global epidemiological indicators , like the incidence of the disease , hide 50 a complex entanglement of highly diversiﬁed social and individual characteristics that perhaps can 51 be ignored in a ﬁrst approximation , but ends up being indispensable to model the epidemic . 52 Several approaches can be pursued . Monitoring indicators , like the daily number of positive 53 tests 3 , 4 , 5 , are useful to track the dynamical evolution of the outbreak in varying conditions and 54 allow simple short - term extrapolations . These results , however , are very sensitive to initial condi - 55 tions and need a continuous readjustment of inputs to be reliable in the long run . The exponential 56 ampliﬁcation of small perturbations in the initial data , typical of epidemics , makes the outcome 57 of an outbreak intrinsically unpredictable 9 . As for similar forecasting models , epidemic models 58 cannot return exact predictions ; epidemic models can , at most , analyse the likelihoods of different 59 scenarios 10 . 60 In this context , simulation tools turn out to be decisive to explore in silico the phase space 61 of all the known variables and to unravel those steps in the contagion whose interdiction would 62 prevent the epidemic progression ( for example , by government policies regarding the introduction 63 of tracking software , quarantine of exposed individuals , selective lockdown or mandatory use of 64 protective masks in certain conditions ) . The purpose of such tools is thus threefold : ﬁrst , they are 65 monitoring tools , able to catch the evolution of the disease ; second , they are forecasting tools , used 66 to identify the conditions that could favour an outbreak ; ﬁnally , they are prevention tools that can 67 provide health authorities with studies on the effectiveness of containment measures .

Some relevant features of 70 COVID - 19 can still be inferred from more sophisticated mathematical models ( for Catalonia , for 71 example , this has been done following a microscopic Markov chain approach applied to an age - 72 stratiﬁed meta - population model 11 ) . The loss of granularity , however , precludes the design of 73 ﬁne - tuned policies , which in turn renders the decision - making process not fully adequate in all 74 aspects and for all groups , as proved not long ago for the case of H5N1 inﬂuenza 12 . 75 In this work we present a different approach , a simulation tool that follows the daily contact 76 network history of each individual in a largely populated area , the province of Barcelona . A precise 77 knowledge of the morphology of these networks has been shown to be of the greatest importance 78 to capture the salient characteristics of the outbreak 13 , 14 . For each individual , we consider their 79 corresponding microenvironment : home location and the co - residence structure , the employment 80 situation and the mobility routine with its resulting pattern of contacts . Using such information , we 81 have developed a stochastic compartmental model that includes both population and epidemiolog - 82 ical data . On the one hand , population data consist of all information about contact networks and 83 mixing patterns ( the “where“ and “how“ people live and move ) , based on the following external 84 inputs : 85 i Socio - demographic individual microdata from the latest census data provided by the Spanish 86 National Statistics Institute 15 . 87 ii Contacts matrices for densely populated ( and country - dependent ) environments 16 , 17 , 18 . 88 5 .

In this regard , we use a compartmental model , where the entire population 92 is classiﬁed into ﬁve states : “susceptible” , “exposed” , “infected” , “diagnosed” and “recovered” 93 ( see Methods ) . 94 Our simulation tool calculates the daily probabilities for each individual of becoming in - 95 fected at home , at work or school , during further social contacts ( generically labelled as “Com - 96 munity” ) and in public transport . Age , co - residence patterns , work activity , local mobility and 97 the usage of public transportation are used to estimate the contacts network of each individual . 98 Measures modifying the network and the frequency of the contacts ( lockdown , teleworking , etc ) 99 are also taken into account , as well as the introduction of protective masks that modify viral load 100 transmission ( see Methods ) . 101 Results 102 Our goal is to simulate the COVID - 19 outbreak within the population of the province of Barcelona 103 ( 5 . 5 million inhabitants ) and reproduce the ﬁrst two epidemic waves experienced in the region 104 during February - June and July - December 2020 for a total of 300 days . We assume the existence of 105 an initial set of about 50 exposed people ( 0 . 001 % of the population ) , randomly distributed across 106 the region . The actual location of people changes throughout the day and throughout the week : the 107 6 .

The pattern of allowed locations 109 and activities evolves according to lockdown and mobility restrictions promulgated during such 110 300 days . 111 The number of individuals in each epidemiological compartment predicted by the simulation 112 as a function of time is shown in Figure 1 . Without lockdown measures ( Figure 1a ) , more than 113 90 % of the total population of Barcelona and its province get affected by the disease in about 100 114 days . Taking into account lockdown measures ( Figure 1b ) , the amount of infected people reduces 115 to 300k in about the same period . In the second wave , continuing until the end of the year , the total 116 number of infected people increases to 750k . Figure 2 presents the numbers of currently infected 117 and newly diagnosed people predicted by the simulation as a function of time . The ﬁgure presents 118 cumulative and age - dependent evolution curves . The subset of hosts of collective accommodation 119 institutions ( nursing homes ) is shown separately . The cumulative curve shows a ﬁrst wave char - 120 acterised by a steep onset , interrupted by the strict lockdown measures established on March 16 , 121 2020 . The mobility restrictions induce the turn - over of the curve and its subsequent decay over a 122 time scale related to the duration of the incubation and infectious phases of the disease . Contacts 123 start increasing again during summer , leading to a second wave in autumn . Adults constitute the 124 most relevant fraction of the infected compartment during both waves . The category of diagnosed 125 is instead dominated by seniors in the ﬁrst wave and adults in the second . 126 Relevant results have been obtained by considering separately age - , social - activity - and 127 7 .

The outcome of the simulation 130 resembles quite closely the real picture emerged in these months for the number of positive 131 PCR tests . Seniors in nursing facilities are notably more numerous than expected from their 132 natural demographic fraction . This pattern results from the joint action of three factors . First , 133 the probability of developing high viral load with strong symptoms increases signiﬁcantly 134 as a function of age starting at 65 years - old , while adults have a much lower probability to 135 develop strong symptoms , and even less so children .

The number of infected people over a period of 300 days is shown split by age categories : less than 15 years old , from 15 to 64 years old and 65 years old and above ( hosts in nursing facilities are shown separately ) .

The features of the second wave with a peak in October are also quali - 139 tatively reproduced , with the spread of the disease picking up again during summer . In this 140 case adults form the group dominating the diagnosed compartment , with children further 141 contributing visibly . The special protection measures taken in nursing facilities ( wearing 142 protective masks ) reduced contagion , while the amount of tests ( and hence the probability to 143 get diagnosed ) increased and reached a larger part of the population .

The number of positive PCR tests in the province of Barcelona for the period between February 10 and December 6 , 2020 is shown separately for the different age segments of the population , including its sum . ii We analysed under which circumstances people become infected either being at home , at 147 work or school , or involved in social activities , such as shopping , leisure time , etc . Public 148 transportation effects are taken into account : mostly during work time for those using mass 149 transportation for their route to work , or during the weekends or the week for those citizens 150 using group travel systems for other activities ( see Methods ) . In our simulation , the amount 151 of available environmental virus , or the viral load each individual is exposed to , is encoded 152 in the force of infection λ , an aggregate parameter accounting for the probability to change 153 the status of an individual from susceptible to exposed ( see Equation 1 in Methods ) . The 154 results in terms of the viral load are shown in Figure 4 . This is an effective way to forecast 155 the risk of contagion in the different social activities .

However , when strong lockdown measures 158 are applied on March 16 , the contributions from work and community drop drastically and 159 contagion at home becomes the most relevant contribution . The exposition to viral load 160 in public transport or due to casual contacts during summer activities is relatively small , 161 overall of the order of 1 % , but is nevertheless a relevant component as it can bring the virus 162 to households and work communities that would otherwise not be exposed to the infection . 163 1 0 / 0 2 / 2 0 2 0 3 1 / 0 3 / 2 0 2 0 2 0 / 0 5 / 2 0 2 0 0 9 / 0 7 / 2 0 2 0 2 8 / 0 8 / 2 0 2 0 1 7 / 1 0 / 2 0 2 0 0 6 / 1 2 / 2 0 2 0 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 V i r a l l o a d / d a y Socializing At home At work or school 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Time [ days ] Figure 4 : Total viral load evolution .

The ﬁrst one is the result of the initially 179 free propagation of the virus , later controlled by the application of strict lockdown measures . Di - 180 agnostics were strongly related to the appearance of symptoms . During the second wave , mobility 181 restrictions were alternatively relaxed and tightened depending on the epidemiological situation . 182 The use of masks proved to be essential , as well as the increase of the efﬁciency of diagnosis of 183 asymptomatic individuals and the corresponding quarantine measures . 184 The simulation tool presented here is able to reproduce the main features of the ﬁrst and 185 second waves of the COVID - 19 outbreak in Barcelona and its province . The detailed description of 186 two extremely heterogeneous categories of data , the sociodemographic and epidemiological ones , 187 is a crucial ingredient . The sociodemographic individual microdata , convoluted with mobility 188 information , are the base for modelling contacts and are necessary in order to correctly reproduce 189 the expansion of the disease governed by the different components of the parameter λ ( Figure 190 4 ) . Indeed , since the contribution coming from the viral load components linked to work - and 191 community - activities is drastically reduced as soon as lockdown measures prevail , co - residence 192 contagion becomes the dominant factor , making it very valuable to use real census data , as done 193 in our study . The incubation time , contagiousness period , and age - dependent strength of viral 194 shedding are all important in order to predict the time proﬁle of the viral shedding of an individual 195 and the overall reaction time to lockdown measures . 196 Many ingredients are intrinsic to the population and do not change as a function of time , 197 13 .

An important one is the probability of being diagnosed , which was ini - 198 tially linked to the appearance of strong symptoms , but later extended to people with less or no 199 symptoms due to more awareness , contact - tracing and mass testing campaigns . As a result , the 200 probability of detection in adults and children increased , reversing the proportions of diagnosed 201 people by age - strata . The lockdown measures were continuously adjusted by the authorities to 202 maintain a delicate equilibrium between the contention of the virus and sustaining the economic 203 and educational activities . Mobile phone data , clearly correlated to these measures ( see Methods ) 204 and available separately for work activities and leisure , are used to predict the time dependence 205 of the level of contacts . The simulation also needs to take into account the increased number of 206 contacts taking place during the summer period in order to generate the conditions for the surge of 207 a second wave . 208 In conclusion , our simulation tool leads to a deep understanding of COVID - 19 dynamics 209 in the province of Barcelona . It is able to reproduce the very different characteristics of the two 210 waves , the underlying dynamics of the second one being much more complex . The stochastic 211 approach allows an easy implementation of the many relevant determinants of the problem with 212 the maximum available granularity , including time dependence . The main advantage of the tool is 213 its capacity to study the relative impact of individual factors and to identify the most critical ones 214 ( see Methods ) . The default conﬁguration does reproduce the relevant features of the data , giving 215 conﬁdence in the prediction of relative variations . More detailed calibration and validation with 216 higher granularity data over longer period of time should bring further insight and precision . The 217 entire machinery can be easily adapted to study the epidemiological picture of any other region for 218 14 .

We can also implement the clinical 219 history of hospitalised patients . In the constant stream of new information about the disease , further 220 data regarding vaccination campaigns , coexistence of different variants of the virus , impact of 221 super - spreaders , effect of local small outbreaks , etc . , could be easily implemented without having 222 to change the structure of the simulation . 223 Methods 224 The simulation described in this work reproduces the ﬁrst and second wave of the COVID - 19 225 outbreak in the province of Barcelona using both epidemiological data and population statistics , 226 linking the “who” , “where” , “how” and “when” with the characteristics of the virus itself . In this 227 section we detail the different aspects of the calculation . In particular , we discuss : the underlying 228 compartmental model ; the data used to describe the population ; the description of contacts be - 229 tween individuals ; how mobility data are processed and used to simulate the impact of lockdown 230 measures ; the implementation of other mitigation strategies ( such as the use of protective masks ) ; 231 how the model is calibrated with the data ; and ﬁnally , a description of the sensitivity of the simu - 232 lation outcome to some of the most relevant parameters . The latter gives insight on the uncertainty 233 of the prediction related to the limited knowledge of the parameters and the probabilistic nature of 234 the problem . 235 SEIDR model We consider a model where the population is divided into ﬁve compartments : “susceptible” , “exposed” , “infected” , “diagnosed” and “recovered” , as shown schematically in 15 .

When susceptible individuals enter in contact with infected persons , their state may change to exposed according to the probability P = 1 − e − λ · ∆ t ( 1 ) where the force of infection λ is proportional to the total viral load to which the individual is 236 exposed per unit time ( day ) and ∆ t is the time interval ( 1 / 3 day ) . 237 S E I D R Asympt .

When becoming infected , individuals are assigned a sub - compartment of disease characteristics with different symptomatology and infectiousness according to their age strata ( 0 - 14y ; 15 - 64y ; 65 + y ) : asymptomatic non infectious ( ANI ) , asymptomatic moderately infectious ( AMI ) and symp - tomatic strongly infectious ( SSI ) . In turn , individuals are assigned the speciﬁc probability of being diagnosed of their sub - compartment ( P D ) and conversely of transiting directly to the recovered compartment 1 − P D . If exposed , individuals are assigned a given set of variables to describe the evolution of the 238 disease in their speciﬁc case . Every exposed person will eventually transit to the infected state . 239 Epidemiological data are available for the incubation time deﬁned as the time between infection 240 16 .

These data are described by a Gamma distribution with average of µ = 241 4 . 58 days and standard deviation σ = 3 . 24 days . The most probable value for incubation time is 3 242 days and the maximum allocated incubation time is 14 days . Epidemiological data show that the 243 infectiousness process ( shedding of virus ) starts about two days before the onset of symptoms 23 . 244 The beginning of that process deﬁnes the transition from the susceptible to the infected state in the 245 simulation and the beginning of the viral load shedding , whose time dependence is described by 246 a Gamma function with average µ = 2 . 5 days and σ = 1 . 5 days . The maximum emission takes 247 place after about 1 . 3 days . So , people shed a signiﬁcant part of their total emission of viral load 248 before the appearance of symptoms . 249 Further characteristics of the disease are set in the simulation according to the results of 250 studies of epidemiological data from the beginning of the epidemics 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 . Each 251 member of the infected compartment is assigned one of three classes of symptoms and infec - 252 tiousness : asymptomatic non - infectious ( ANI ) , asymptomatic moderately infectious ( AMI ) and 253 symptomatic strongly infectious ( SSI ) ( Figure 6 ) . The probability of belonging to such classes 254 is strongly age - dependent : older people have a higher probability to develop symptoms and be 255 more infectious , while children are more likely to be asymptomatic non - infectious . In addition , we 256 assume a relation between the intensity of symptoms and infectiousness : infectious people with 257 symptoms emit about twice as much viral load as asymptomatic infectious . In turn , each category 258 has a speciﬁc associated probability of being diagnosed , which varied along the year . During the 259 ﬁrst wave , PCR tests were done mainly for people with strong symptoms , while during the second 260 wave they would include close contacts of identiﬁed cases and random mass screenings .

In the ﬁrst wave P SSID = 1 , while P ANID and P AMID 262 = 0 . In the second wave P SSID = 1 , while P ANID = 0 . 4 and P AMID = 0 . 5 . As a result , the probability 263 to be diagnosed for the age strata 65 + y is 70 % in the ﬁrst wave and goes up to 85 % in the second 264 wave , for the age strata 15 - 64y the probability changes from 15 % to 55 % , and for the age strata 265 0 - 14y from 1 % up to 30 % . In the simulation , the transition takes place in eight steps between 266 June 25 and July 7 , causing some discontinuities in the daily number of newly diagnosed people 267 as seen in Figure 2b . People diagnosed are informed of the result after a time calculated according 268 to a Poisson distribution with an average of six days since the start of infectiousness , a minimum 269 of three and a maximum of 14 days 27 . In the simulation diagnosed individuals are immediately 270 put in effective quarantine and are thus no more contagious . All infected and diagnosed people 271 will eventually move to the recovered state , at the latest 14 days after the start of infectiousness 29 . 272 Hospitalisation , admission to intensive care and possible death have not been implemented so far . 273 Recovered people are considered immune . 274 Population data To simulate the history of each of the 5 . 5 million citizens of the Catalan province 275 of Barcelona , we create a directory , based on the most updated census ( “Cens de poblaci´o i habi - 276 tatges” ) 15 , with an entry for every individual . The original data set consists of approximately 277 400 , 000 people , each carrying an effective weight to account for the whole population . Each el - 278 ement is characterised by a household identiﬁer , age , gender and further relevant characteristics 279 ( e . g . , occupation , location of the workplace , commuting time - if any - , commuting means of 280 transport - if any - , etc . ) . The province of Barcelona is divided into 83 areas : notably , the city of 281 Barcelona is divided into 51 neighbourhoods , while the rest of the province is split into 32 regions 282 18 .

In particular , the long - term care facilities suffered from 285 an unfortunate notoriety due to the high mortality rate of their residents compared to people of the 286 same age group living in family dwellings . The census we employed to reconstruct the population 287 does not take into account people aged 65 years or over who reside in nursing facilities . In order 288 to include this sector of the population , we used the list of the 756 ofﬁcial long - term care facilities 289 established in 2019 , along with details regarding the available places therein 30 . The relative age 290 structure of the elderly population living in these facilities is almost symmetrically inverse to that 291 of the elderly population living in family dwellings 31 : the oldest among the elderly live mainly 292 in institutions , while the youngest live in private homes . Given the average occupancy level of 293 nursing facilities at 86 % 32 and the location of each of the facilities , we reconstruct the proﬁle for 294 the estimated population of 40 , 000 individuals hosted in nursing homes . The ages of each of the 295 individuals are randomly assigned according to the overall age structure . 296 Description of activities and contacts The history of activities of every individual is simulated 297 as a function of time . The time is organised in weeks , with ﬁve labour days and two weekend 298 days . A day is subdivided into three 8 - hour intervals . The three daily time intervals correspond to 299 time spent : i ) at home , ii ) at work / school for workers and pupils ( or at home for the rest ) , and iii ) 300 in generic social activities . During the weekend , people are either at home or involved in social 301 activities . The weekly pattern of occupations , together with the granularity of 8 - hour interval , is 302 19 .

This pattern is modiﬁed with time according to lockdown measures ( e . g . , closure of 303 schools or promotion of teleworking ) . We deﬁne ﬁve categories of contacts : 304 i Home : The home contacts include the explicit group of individuals sharing the same house - 305 hold or nursing facility . The average number of home contacts per person is 2 . 73 . 306 ii Work and School : We assume closed groups whose sizes follow a Poisson distribution with 307 mean 10 for work , and ﬁxed sizes for school classes varying from seven for 0 - year - old to 28 308 above 12 - year - old 33 . In the simulation all workers and students are assigned a company or a 309 school class , which is constant for the whole simulation period . Contacts happening in these 310 reduced groups are stable and long - lasting . In both cases , we use the census information 311 on both the proximity of the workplace and commuting time to simulate a geographical 312 distribution of companies and schools . There are 2 . 2M workers and 950k school pupils . On 313 average , the resulting number of contacts per person at work or at school is 13 . 6 . 314 iii Community : Here we include social contacts ( other than in the family or occupational bub - 315 bles ) that we generically label as “Community” contacts . The number of assigned contacts 316 is distributed as a Gaussian with means taken from the largest and most up - to - date synthetic 317 contact matrices set 16 . The average number of contacts is age - dependent , but not the age 318 proﬁle of these contacts . Contacts are randomly assigned within the same region and are 319 again assumed to be stable contacts but not of the “bubble” type : indeed , each element A 320 has its own ﬁxed “Community” network C ( the “friends circle of A ” ) , however , an element 321 B ∈ C has a “Community” network C (cid:48) that does not necessarily coincide with that of A .

This may lead to additional occasional contacts beyond 325 the network of stable contacts described above . Using the most recent survey on the use of 326 means of transport in the province of Barcelona 17 , we estimate that 20 % of schoolchildren 327 plus 30 % of workers use public transport on their way to school and workplace . We further 328 estimate that 10 % of the total population uses public transport for other personal reasons . 329 We assume an effective number of about one occasional such contact per round trip and that 330 the users all carry the average viral load of the population using public transport to go to 331 work / school , or for community activities , depending on the case . 332 v Occasional contacts during community activities : 333 Finally , there may be further contacts of occasional nature , similar to the case of the public 334 transport . We assume that such contacts took place during the summer 2020 as a result of 335 the relaxation of lockdown measures coinciding with typical summer activities in crowded 336 outdoor settings ( traditional festivals , cultural events , beach tourism ) . Some of these activi - 337 ties included also the additional presence of travellers from outside the province , modifying 338 the effective population 34 . In the simulation , the number of such contacts is set to one per 339 person with people carrying a viral load equal to the average of the full population . 340 Mobility data To control the spread of the disease , authorities imposed lockdown measures re - 341 stricting the mobility , starting from March 16 , 2020 and lasting for the rest of the year . We use the 342 21 . CC - BY - ND 4 . 0 International license It is made available under a is the author / funder , who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity .

Only phones with Spanish numbers are considered in the study . The INE aggregated 345 these data into subgroups of population that remain , enter or leave a set of “mobility areas” 20 . 346 Data are provided for the year 2020 , starting from March 16 , both for weekdays and weekends . 347 They are normalised to reference data from November 2019 . We use the average data of the full 348 Barcelona province as an indicator of work mobility and leisure mobility . The normalised intensity 349 of mobile phones trafﬁc is shown in Figure 7 . 350 Lockdown measures To simulate the impact of the lockdown measures 35 , we combine two meth - 351 ods . Measures like school closure are directly implemented by changing the conﬁguration of the 352 activity in the time intervals . For example , pupils stay at home instead of going to school , and do 353 not use public transport . For the reduction of work or community contacts , we rely on the time 354 evolution of the mobility , as justiﬁed by the correlation between mobility changes and conﬁnement 355 measures observed in Figure 7 . There is a a substantial dip in mid - March when the ﬁrst lockdown 356 was implemented , after which the mobility slowly increases . A smaller effect is observed around 357 mid - August ( possibly related to holidays ) , and a more pronounced one later towards the end of 358 October associated with a tightening of the measures . Such correlation was also observed in other 359 regions across Europe 36 . In the simulation , we use the reduction of mobility to calculate the 360 fraction of citizens teleworking or staying at home instead of participating to social activities . 361 22 .

Ratio between the intensity of mobile phones trafﬁc during the period covered by the simulation , and for a reference week in November 2019 . The pattern is inﬂuenced by the several containment measures adopted along the year . On March 16 , 2020 the Spanish government decreed a state of alarm imposing of a succession of lockdown measures starting on the same day and lasting until June 8 . The number of people in gatherings was limited to 10 and 6 persons on June 29 and September 26 , respectively . Teleworking was encouraged , shops’ and cultural events’ capacity was reduced to 30 % and 50 % , respectively . Among other containment measures enforced on October 19 , restaurants were closed , and university lectures made virtual . Further mitigation strategies The use of protective masks was initially deterred ( mostly due to 362 the attempt of diverting the available masks to the healthcare providers ) , later encouraged and 363 ﬁnally imposed . Studies show that wearing masks reduces virus transmission , although the extent 364 of such reduction is difﬁcult to quantify precisely 37 , 38 . The effect of wearing a mask is simulated 365 by introducing a factor reducing the viral load transmission at work and in community activities and 366 set to roughly estimated values , 0 . 7 when it was encouraged and 0 . 35 when imposed . We assume 367 23 . CC - BY - ND 4 . 0 International license It is made available under a is the author / funder , who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity .

In the simulation , we limit the reduction of viral load transmission 370 from 0 . 35 to 0 . 85 for 13 to 35 years old people , from the end of October onward . 371 Calibration procedure The simulation counts with a total of 64 parameters to characterise the 372 disease ( 26 ) , the contacts ( 32 ) and the lockdown and self - protection measures ( 6 ) ( see Supple - 373 mentary Material ) . Most of them are set according to external information . Out of the 64 param - 374 eters that control the simulation , only 8 are adjusted with data as described below . First , we need 375 to calibrate the scale factor converting the viral load calculated in arbitrary units into the force of 376 infection leading to the correct probability of being infected . This probability governs the time 377 needed to reach the onset of the explosive contagion regime and its growth rate . Second , for each 378 speciﬁc value of the calibration parameter , we adjust the starting time of the lockdown measures 379 in the simulation in order to approximately reproduce the rate of 1500 diagnosed people per day 380 observed in the data at the peak of the ﬁrst wave , as shown in Figure 3 . We check that the growth 381 rate is well reproduced : it should take about 10 days to go from 15 % to 85 % of the peak value . 382 After adjusting the time , we see that the initial 50 infections happened ﬁve weeks before the start 383 of lockdown measures , on February 10 . Although the arrival time of the ﬁrst infectious people in 384 Catalonia is not precisely known , such date seems reasonable in view of the international context 385 of the development of the disease . Third , the three categories of infectiousness need to be assigned 386 a probability to be diagnosed for the ﬁrst and the second wave . The probability of the strongly 387 symptomatic to be diagnosed is set to one in both cases . The probability to be diagnosed for 388 24 .

These two parameters are set to zero in the ﬁrst wave and have been adjusted 390 in order to approximately reproduce the observed proportion of diagnosed people by age - categories 391 in the second wave ( Figure 3 ) . Fourth , additional summer contacts are needed in order to increase 392 the risk of regrowth and facilitate the appearance of a second wave . The four corresponding pa - 393 rameters ( number of contacts , segment of population affected , and starting and ending dates ) have 394 been adjusted accordingly , in order to also respect the observed proportions of diagnosed people 395 in the different regions ( Figure 5a ) . 396 Sensitivity to Parameters 397 We studied the sensitivity of the simulation to the parameters and identiﬁed the most critical ones . 398 This is relevant to understand the weakest points of the mitigation strategies . It also indicates what 399 should be better known for an improved precision of the simulation . 400 First we report on the impact of parameters governing the response of individuals to the 401 disease . 402 i If we reduce the overall scale of infectiousness by a factor of two , it takes twice as much 403 time to reach the explosive contagion regime . 404 ii Reducing by a factor of two the probability to be diagnosed in the asymptomatic non - 405 infectious and asymptomatic infectious categories during the second wave signiﬁcantly re - 406 25 .

As a con - 407 sequence a factor of 2 . 5 more people become infected and the number of people diagnosed 408 increases by 30 % . 409 iii The time it takes for people to get diagnosed is drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean 410 six 27 . A minimum of three days is set for the notiﬁcation of the diagnosis . Removing the 411 minimum does not have much impact , but setting it to large values does . If it is set to six 412 days , people are put later in quarantine and more contagions can take place . The number of 413 diagnosed people in the second wave doubles at the same time as the delay in the notiﬁcation 414 delays the peak by about a week . 415 iv The effectiveness of the mask is important in the surge and strength of the second wave . The 416 simulation shows that without that protection a second wave would have quickly developed . 417 Changing the nominal reduction of viral load transmission of 0 . 35 by ± 0 . 05 changes the 418 number of diagnosed people by ± 50 % . With much stronger reduction no second wave 419 would develop . 420 Next we investigate the sensitivity to the pattern of contacts . 421 i The size of the contact groups at work is given by a Poisson distribution with mean 10 . 422 Changing it to 5 ( 20 ) leads to a reduction ( increase ) of 15 % of diagnosed people . The 423 impact is smaller in the second wave due to teleworking . 424 ii In addition to the 950k school pupils there are 95k university students . Since our census data 425 26 .

To analyse the impact of this assumption , we aggregated 428 them to the pupils , assuming an average size of closed groups of contacts of 15 . They 429 resumed presential classes in mid - September . As a result , the peak of the ﬁrst wave increased 430 by 25 % without readjusting the time of lockdown , while the peak of the second went down 431 by 25 % . 432 iii We studied the impact of making the number of community contacts dependent on the den - 433 sity of the population . We tested a model where the proportionality factor varies from 0 . 6 to 434 2 , between Bergued ` a and Barcelon ` es , respectively , the lowest and highest density regions . 435 The average number of community contacts increases from 4 . 8 to 7 . 6 . During the ﬁrst wave , 436 the total number of diagnosed increases by 30 % . The overall effect is less noticeable during 437 the second wave , but the number of diagnoses in the Barcelon ` es starts dominating , unlike 438 what is observed in Figure 5a . Such a strong density dependence is thus disfavoured . 439 iv The number of additional summer contacts is much more critical than the contacts in trans - 440 port as they affect potentially a much more signiﬁcant fraction of the population . Doubling 441 the default level of one contact generates an earlier wave during the period where a rela - 442 tively ﬂat distribution is observed , while dividing by two reduces the level of diagnoses in 443 early summer by a factor of six , and no second wave develops . We also tested the impact of 444 limiting the extra contacts to the Barcelon ` es area rather than the whole province . However , 445 this option does not reproduce well the sharing of diagnosed cases in the different regions 446 27 .

In the default conﬁguration , they are randomly distributed geographically in 449 the province . We kept the same total number but randomly varied their location . In the ﬁrst 450 wave , this results in a variation of the onset time by ± 2 . 5 days . If we keep the starting date of 451 lockdown ﬁxed , the maximum of the ﬁrst wave varies by about ± 30 % . Indeed the starting 452 time of the lockdown measures is quite critical , since one week delay typically results in 453 a factor of three higher number of diagnosed people per day at the peak . The cases with 454 upward ﬂuctuations of the number of diagnosed people in the second wave are , in general , 455 not correlated with the cases of upward ﬂuctuations in the ﬁrst wave . Only in about 1 % of 456 the cases , when the ﬁrst wave developed very early , the number of infected people grew a 457 factor of three more before the lockdown took effect ( the date was kept ﬁxed ) . These people 458 eventually became immune , and later , no strong second wave was able to develop . 459 Finally , we studied variations in the description of mobility . 460 i To test the relevance of mobility and its correlation with the time dependence of the num - 461 ber of diagnosed people , we artiﬁcially introduced an additional four weeks of ﬂat level 462 of mobility in July . This has a strongly correlated effect on the time - dependent pattern of 463 the spread , showing that mobility is a crucial ingredient for describing the evolution of the 464 pandemic . 465 28 .

Increasing 466 the relative normalisation of the second set ( after mid - June ) by 10 % almost doubles the level 467 of infected people and shifts the peak earlier by one week . 468 In summary , we have explored part of the phase space of the many parameters playing a role 469 in the expansion of the virus . The most sensitive ones include the effect of the protective masks , the 470 probability of diagnosis , the characteristics of seasonal ( summer ) contacts and mobility . In some 471 cases , more precise external information can be gathered ( e . g . likelihood of diagnostic ) , or the full 472 granularity of the information could be used , leading to possible improvement ( e . g . mobility per 473 region ) . More complex are the cases of protective masks or summer contacts . Improvements could 474 come from a more detailed description of the parameters together with a comparison with high 475 granularity data in terms of age and location . 476 29 .
