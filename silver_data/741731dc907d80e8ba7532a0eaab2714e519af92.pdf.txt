The Rho small GTP - binding protein family regulates various actomyosin - dependent cell functions , such as cell morphology , locomotion , cytokinesis , membrane ruffling , and smooth muscle contraction . In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , there is a homo - logue of mammalian RhoA , RH01 , which is essential for vegetative growth of yeast cells . To explore the function of the RH01 gene , we isolated a recessive temperature - sensitive mutation of Rtt01 , rho1 - 104 . The rho1 - 104 mutation caused amino acid substitutions of Asp 72 to Asn and Cys 164 to Tyr of Rholp . Strains bearing the rho1 - 104 mutation accumulated tiny - or small - budded cells in which cortical actin patches were clustered to buds at the restrictive temperature . Cell lysis and cell death were also seen with the rho1 - 104 mutant . Indirect immunofluorescence micro - scopic study demonstrated that Rholp was concen - trated to the periphery of the cells where cortical actin patches were clustered , including the site of bud emer - gence , the tip of the growing buds , and the mother - bud neck region of cells prior to cytokinesis . Indirect immunofluorescence study with cells overexpressing RH01 suggested that the Rholp - binding site was saturable . A mutant Rholp with an amino acid substi - tution at the lipid modification site remained in the cytoplasm . These results suggest that Rhol small GTP - binding protein binds to a specific site at the growth region of cells , where Rholp exerts its function in controlling cell growth . T HE yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae grows by budding for cell division ( Drubin , 1991 ; Nelson , 1992 ) . This polarized cell growth is initiated by signals from the cell surface that result in realignment of the cytoskeleton and the biosynthetic machinery toward a targeting patch at the bud site . Membrane protein transport to the cell surface is mediated by vesicles , which become selectively targeted to the bud site . Bud site assembly and growth are also coupled to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . Disruption of the single actin gene in S . cerevisiae results in abnormal cell growth and intraceUular accumulation of vesicles ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ) . Moreover , there is a strong correlation between occurrence of active growth at the bud tip and clustering of cortical actin patches at the same tip . Cortical actin patches are concentrated at the site of bud emergence The present address of W .

Near the end of the cell cycle , cortical actin patches concentrate in the neck region connecting the mother cell to its bud . However , it is not clear how the actin cytoskeleton is linked to bud assembly at the membrane . Genetic approaches have been exploited in S . cerevisiae to identify genes that are required for assembly and growth of a bud . Genes CDC24 and CDC42 have been identified to be necessary for bud site assembly ( Sloat et al . , 1981 ; Adams et al . , 1990 ; Johnson and Pringle , 1990 ) . Mutations in these genes do not result in bud formation , but in an overall in - crease of cell surface . In these mutants , cortical actin patches uniformly distribute over the entire cell surface . The CDC42 and CDC24 genes encode a small guanosine 5 ' - triphosphate ( GTp ) l - binding protein ( small G protein ) ( Johnson and Pringle , 1990 ) and a putative guanine nucleotide exchange protein for Cdc42p ( Hart et al . , 1991 ) , respectively . Two other genes encoding small G proteins , RH03 and Rtt04 , 1 .

All other strains were congenie to RAY - 3A - D - 1C . have recently been shown to be involved in the control of bud growth ( Matsui and Toh - e , 1992 ) . In the mammalian system , evidence is accumulating that small G proteins regulate various cell functions ( Hall , 1990 ; Bourne et al . , 1991 ; Takai et al . , 1992 ) . Of the many small G proteins , the Rho family , consisting of three members , A , B , and C , has been suggested to regulate the actomyosin sys - tem . This is based on the observations that Clostridium botu - linum ADP - ribosyltransferase , C3 , which selectively ADP - ribosylates the Rho family ( Aktories et al . , 1988 ; Kikuchi et al . , 1988 ; Narumiya et al . , 1988 ) , changes stress fibers ( Paterson et al . , 1990 ; Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) . Moreover , it has recently been shown that RhoA plays an important role in various actomyosin - dependent cell functions , including cell morphology ( Rubin et al . , 1988 ; Paterson et al . , 1990 ; Miura et al . , 1993 ) , smooth muscle contraction ( Hirata et al . , 1992 ) , platelet aggregation ( Morii et al . , 1992 ) , cell mo - tility ( Takaishi et al . , 1993 , 1994 ) , cytokinesis ( Kishi et al . , 1993 ) , lymphocyte aggregation ( Tominaga et al . , 1993 ) , lymphocyte - mediated cytotoxicity ( Lang et al . , 1992 ) , and membrane ruffling ( Nishiyama et al . , 1994 ) . Rho has guanosine 5 ' - diphosphate ( GDP ) - bound inactive and GTP - bound active forms which are interconvertible by GDP / GTP exchange and GTPase reactions . The conversion from the GDP - bound inactive form to the GTP - bound active form is regulated by GDP / GTP exchange proteins and the re - verse conversion is regulated by GTPase - activating proteins . There are two types of GDP / GTP exchange proteins for Rho ; one is a stimulatory type , named Stag GDP dissociation stimulator ( GDS ) ( Kaibuchi et al . , 1991 ) and Rho GDS ( Isomura et al . , 1990 ) , and the other is an inhibitory type , named Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor ( GDI ) ( Fukumoto et al . , 1990 ) . We have recently demonstrated that a proto - oncogene product , Dbl , acts as a GDS for Rho ( Yaku et al . , 1994 ) . Recently , a homologue closely related to Rho GDI has been found and shown to be expressed in hematopoietic cells ( Lelias et al . , 1993 ) . Rho undergoes three kinds of post - translational modifications in the COOH - terminal region : geranylgeranylation of the cysteine residue , removal of the three COOH - terminal amino acids , and carboxyl methyl - ation of the exposed cysteine residue ( Katayama et al . , 1991 ) . Rho GDI and Stag GDS are active on only the posttransla - tionally processed form of RhoA ( Hori et al . , 1991 ; Mizuno et al . , 1991 ) , whereas Dbl is active on both the posttransla - tionally processed and unprocessed form of RhoA , but is much more active on the former than on the latter form ( Yaku et al . , 1994 ) . In the cytosol of resting smooth muscle and insulinoma cells , Rho is present in the GDP - bound inactive form com - plexed with Rho GDI ( Kuroda et al . , 1992 ; Regazzi et al . , 1992 ) , and the inhibitory action of Rho GDI in the GDP / GTP exchange reaction is stronger than the stimulatory action of Stag GDS , Rho GDS , or Dbl if both are present ( Kikuchi et al . , 1992 ; Kuroda et al . , 1992 ; Yaku et al . , 1994 ) . On the basis of these observations , we have tenta - tively proposed the following modes of activation and action of Rho . In resting ceils , the posttranslationally processed form of Rho is present in the cytosol as the GDP - bound inac - tive form complexed with Rho GDI . Upon stimulation with some signals , the inhibitory action of Rho GDI is released in an unknown manner , the GDP - bound inactive form of Rho becomes sensitive to the action of Stag GDS , Rho GDS , or Dbl , and the GTP - bound active form is produced . By this ac - tivation , Rho interacts with its effector protein and exerts its biological function through this effector protein . A homologue of mammalian RhoA gene , RItO1 , has been identified in S . cerevisiae ( Madaule et al . , 1987 ) . The amino acid sequence of Rholp is * 70 % identical with that of RhoA , and Rholp like RhoA has been shown to be ADP - ribosylated by Ca ( McCaffrey et al . , 1991 ) . A gene disruption experi - ment on RHO1 indicates that RItO1 is an essential gene , but the cellular function of RHO1 remains to be clarified . In this report , we have isolated a temperature - sensitive mutation of the RItO1 gene . The rhol mutation results in accumulation of tiny - or small - budded cells at nonpermissive temperature . Consistently , immunofluorescence study demonstrates that Rholp is localized at the periphery of the bud emergence sites or of the tips of growing buds . Cortical actin patches are overlappingly clustered to the Rholp - stainlng sites . We describe the function of RH01 in the process of bud for - mation . Materials and Methods Strains , Media , and Cell Growth Conditions Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I . Escherichia coil DH5c¢ was used for the construction and propagation of plasmids . Yeast strains were grown on a rich medium , YPD , which contained 1 % Bacto - yeast ex - tract ( Difco Laboratories , Detroit , MI ) , 2 % Bacto - peptone ( Difco ) , 2 % glucose , 0 . 04 % adenine , and 0 . 02 % uracil . Yeast transformations were per - formed by lithium acetate methods ( Ito et ai . , 1983 ; Gietz et al . , 1992 ) , and other standard yeast genetic manipulations were performed as de - scribed by Sherman et al . ( 1986 ) . Transformants were grown in SD medium which contained 2 % glucose and 0 . 7 % yeast nitrogen base without amino The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 125 , 1994 1078 acids ( Difco ) . SG medium contained 3 % galactose , 0 . 2 % sucrose , and 0 . 7 % yeast nitrogen base without amino acids . SD or SG medium was sup - plemented with amino acids or bases when required . SD lacking uracil ( SD - ura ) , SG lacking uracil , SD lacking leucine , and SG lacking leucine were used for the selection of transformants . SD + 5 - fluoro - orotic acid ( 5 - FOA ) ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) medium was prepared as described previously ( Boeke et al . , 1984 ) . Viable cell count was determined by plat - ing appropriately diluted culture of the rhol - 104 mutant incubated at 24 or 37°C . Cell lysis was examined by assaying alkaline phosphatase activ - ity using a chromogenic substrate 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl - phosphate ( BCIP ) ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) as described previously ( Paravicini et al . , 1992 ) . Flow cytometric analysis was performed as described previously ( Ninomiya - Tsuji et al . , 1991 ) . Plasmid Constructions Standard molecular biological techniques were performed to construct plas - raids ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ) . The plasmid pWT consists of the wild - type 1 . 4 - kbp EcoRI - EcoRI restriction fragment containing RItOI cloned into the URA3 - bearing high copy number vector YEp352 ( Madauie et al . , 1987 ) . The 2 . 2 - kbp SauI - BglII genomic fragment contained , , ol . 2 kbp up - stream and 414 bp downstream noncoding regions . This fragment was cloned into the URA3 - beadng single copy vector pRS316 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) to construct a plasmid pRS316 - RHO1 . A 6 - bp nontranslated sequence in pRS316 - RHO1 , AGAAAG , which is located immediately up - stream of the RttO1 open reading frame , was changed to the KpnI site , GGTACC , by use of the in vitro mutagenesis technique to construct a plus - mid pRS316 - RHO1 ( KpnI ) ( Higuchi , 1989 ) . Synthetic oligonucleotides en - coding the HA epitope , YPYDVPDYA , which is derived from the influenza hemagglntinin protein , was cloned into the KpnI site of pRS316 - RHO1 ( KpnI ) to construct pRS316 - HA - RHO1 , which has two copies of the HA epitope ( Wilson et al . , 1984 ; Field et al . , 1988 ; Kolodziej and Young , 1991 ) . The 2 . 2 - kbp DNA fragment of the HA - RH01 gene was cloned into the URA3 - bearing multicopy vector , YEp352 ( Hill et al . , 1986 ) , and in - tegration vector , pRS306 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) , to construct YEp352 - HA - RHO1 and pRS306 - HA - RHO1 , respectively . A plasmid pRS316 - HA - rhol ( C206S ) was constructed from pRS316 - HA - RHO1 by changing G617 to C in the RH01 open reading frame by use of the in vitro mutagenesis technique , which caused an amino acid substitution of cysteine 206 of Rholp to serine . Expected changes of DNA sequence induced by in vitro mutagen - esis or by the insertion of oligonucleotides were confirmed by DNA se - quencing . The EcoRI - Sa / I PCR fragments containing the RIt01 and RhoA open reading frames were cloned into YCp - LEU2 - GAL1 , which carried the LEU2 marker and the GAL / promoter on a single copy plasmid , to construct YCp - LEU2 - GAL1 - RHO1 and YCp - LEU2 - GAL1 - RhoA , respectively . Hydroxylamine Mutagenesis The plasmid pWT was mutagenized in vitro by hydroxylamine as described ( Rose and Fink , 1987 ) . Briefly , 10 # g of pWT DNA was added to 500 # 1 of a fresh hydroxylamine solution ( 0 . 09 g NaOH and 0 . 35 g hydroxyl - amine - HCl in 5 mi ice - cold water ) , and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 20 h . Plasmid DNA was recovered by precipitation at - 80°C in ethanol , and was transformed into a yeast strain TM2 - 1A . The rhol : : HIS3 disruption mutation in TM2 - 1A was previously made by replacing the 460 - bp EcoRI - ClaI fragment of RHO1 with the HIS3 DNA fragment ( Madaule et al . , 1987 ) . Construction of the rhol - 104 Mutant The genomic rhol : : HIS3 disrupted gene was replaced with the rhol - 104 gene by pop - in / pop - out replacement ( Rothstein , 1991 ) . The KpnI - SacI DNA fragment containing the rhol - 104 mutant gene was cut out from pRS316 - rhoM04 and was cloned into the KpnI - SacI site of an integration vector pRS306 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . The resulting plasmid pRS306 - rhoM04 was cut at the HpaI site located 22 bp downstream of the RH01 open reading frame and was subsequently transformed into TM2 - 1A . A transformant of TM2 - 1A in which pRS306 - rhol - 104 was targeted at the RItO1 locus was selected by Southern hybridization analysis . Since the recombination occurred downstream of the HIS3 insertion site , a second recombination upstream of HIS3 would give rise to a strain in which the rhol : : HIS3 gene is replaced by the rhol - 104 gene . The resulting strain would show a Ura - , His - , and temperature - sensitive growth phenotype . Cells of the transformant were spread on a plate containing 5 - FOA to select Ura - clones as described ( Boeke et al . , 1984 ) . Among 5 - FOA - resistant clones His - clones were searched for and one of such clones , HNY21 , was iso - lated . Southern hybridization analysis confirmed that the rhol : : HIS3 gene was replaced by the rhol - 104 gene in HNY21 . The temperature - sensitive growth phenotype of HNY21 was suppressed by pRS316 - RHOI . Western Blot Analysis of Rholp HA - Rhol proteins expressed in yeast cells were detected by Western blot analysis with 12CA5 mAb ( W ' dson et aL , 1984 ; Field et al . , 1988 ) . Total yeast protein was extracted from exponentially growing cells by the method described previously ( Kuchler et al . , 1993 ) . About 1 x l0 s cells grown in YPD medium were harvested by brief centrifugation , washed once in a lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCI and 1 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 5 , containing 2 % 2 - mer - captoethanol and 100 izM p - amidinophenyl methanesuifonyl fluoride - HCI ) , and resuspended in 500 # 1 of the same cold lysis buffer . All subse - quent steps were carried out at 4 " C . About 1 g of prechilled glass beads ( 0 . 45 - ram diam ) were added to the cell suspension and lysis was achieved by vigorous vortex mixing for five 2 - rain intervals with 1 rain of cooling in between . The resulting homogenates were collected and unbroken cells , glass beads , and large debris were removed twice by centrifugation for 5 rain at 450 g . Membranes were collected from the clarified lysate by sedimentation for 1 h at 100 , 000 g . The particulate fraction was rinsed with the lysis buffer and resuspended in the same buffer . 60 # g of each protein sample from the homogenates and the cytosolic and particulate fractions was subjected to SDS - PAGE and separated proteins were electrophoreti - cally transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane sheet ( BA85 , pore size : 0 . 45 # m ; Schleicher & Schuell Inc . , Keene , NH ) . The sheet was processed to detect HA - Rholp with 10 # g / mi of affinity - purified 12CA5 mAb as a pri - mary antibody by using the ECL detection kit ( Amersham Corp . , Arlington Heights , IL ) . Cytological Techniques For staining of actin and DNA in rhol mutants , cells cultured under the per - missive or restrictive conditions were fixed with 4 % of formaldehyde at 25°C for 30 rain . After washing once with PBS , cells were stained with rhodamine phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Inc . , Eugene , OR ) at a final con - centration of 0 . 5 # M for 30 min ( Adams and Pringle , 1991 ) . After washing three times with PBS , cells were costained with 4 ' , 6 ' - diamidino - 2 - phenyl - indole dihydroclfloride ( DAPI ) ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) at a final concentra - tion of 0 . 1 / ~ g / ml for 15 rain . After washing twice with PBS , cells were ob - served and photographed on Neopan Super Presto film ( Fuji Photo Film , Tokyo , Japan ) using a Zeiss Axiopbot microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . To visualize the intracellular localization of HA - Rholp , yeast cells ex - pressing HA - Rholp were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy by the methods of Pringle et al . ( 1991 ) . Cells were fixed with 4 % of formalde - hyde at 25 " C for 2 . 5 h . Affinity - purified 12CA5 mAb was used as a primary antibody at a concentration of 25 # g / ml and the FITC - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( Cappel Laboratories , Malvern , PA ) was used as a second - ary antibody at a concentration of 10 / . tg / mi . After washing with PBS , cells were costained with rhodamine phalloidin . Stained cells were observed and photographed as described above . Results Isolation of a Temperature - sensitive Mutation in RHO1 The RItO1 gene has been demonstrated to be essential for vegetative growth of cells in S . cerevisiae ( Madaule et al . , 1987 ) . To explore the function of the RHO1 gene , a condi - tional mutation of RHO1 , which is a temperature - sensitive mutation , was isolated . An episomal plasmid bearing the RItO1 and URA3 genes , pWT - RHO1 , was mutagenized with hydroxylamine as described in Materials and Methods . This mutagenized plasmid DNA was directly transformed into the yeast strain TM2 - 1A , which carried the rhol mutation dis - rupted with HIS3 and a plasmid , YCp - LEU2 - GAL1 - RHO1 , bearing the GALI - RItO1 gene and the LEU2 gene . TM2 - 1A grows on a galactose - containing medium but not on a glucose - containing medium since the GAL / promoter is repressed by a glucose . Transformants were selected on SD - Yamochi et al .

Cell growth and cell viability curves of the rhol - 104 mu - tant cells . Cells growing exponentially at 24°C of the wild - type strain RAY - 3A - D ( m , e ) or the rhol - 104 mutant strain HNY30 ( rhol - 104 / rho1 - 104 ) ( D , o ) were incubated at 24°C ( m , n ) or at 370C ( e , o ) for the indicated times . Timecourses of cell number ( more than 1 , 000 cells were counted for each determination ) ( A ) , optical density at 660 um ( B ) , or percentage of viable cells ( C ) was determined . ura plate media at 24°C , and colonies were replica - plated onto SD - ura plate media which were subsequently incubated at 37°C for 2 d . From , x , 10 , 000 clones screened , candidate clones which showed temperature - sensitive growth pheno - type were isolated , and the plasmids were recovered through E . coli transformation . One plasmid which conferred a temperature - sensitive growth phenotype on TM2 - 1A was identified and used for further study . The 1 . 4 - kbp EcoRI - EcoRI restriction fragment carrying the mutant rhol gene was cloned into a single copy vector pRS316 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . This plasmid again conferred a temperature - sensitive growth phenotype on TM2 - 1A . The plasmid carry - ing the temperature - sensitive mutation of RttO1 , rhol - 104 , did not retard growth of wild - type cells , indicating that the mutation was recessive . The mutation site in rhol - 104 responsible for the tempera - ture - sensitive trait was mapped to a 476 - bp NheI - HpaI re - striction fragment in the RItO1 open reading frame . DNA sequencing of this fragment of the mutant gene resulted in the identification of two transition mutations : both G214 and G491 in the RItO1 open reading frame were changed to A . These mutations were consistent with the specificity of base changes which could be induced by the hydroxylamine muta - genesis as described ( Sikorski and Boeke , 1991 ) . The first mutation changed Asp 72 to Asn ( D72N ) and the second mu - tation changed Cys 164 to Tyr ( C164Y ) . The D72N substitu - tion occurred five amino acids downstream of one of the two conserved phosphate / Mg2 + - binding loops , Asp - Thr - Ala - Gly - Gln , while the C164Y substitution occurred at X in Glu - X - Ser - Ala , which is one of the guanine base - binding loops ( Valencia et al . , 1991 ) . We have not determined which sub - stitution is responsible for the temperature - sensitive trait of the rho1 - 104 mutation . The genomic rhol gene was replaced with the rho1 - 104 mutant gene by the pop - in / pop - out method as described in Materials and Methods . This strain , HNY21 , showed a temperature - sensitive growth phenotype which could be suppressed by a plasmid bearing the wild - type RH01 gene . HNY21 or its derivatives were used for further experiments . Characterization of the rho1 - 104 Mutant Examination of time courses of cell growth of the wild type and the rho1 - 104 mutant cells ( HNY30 ) indicated that the 100 I00 , A • 24oc , ¢ , 8o 3 , oc 80 I 5 = L Z ~ 6 ( : 60 B • 24o0 37oc 20 20 0 0 oo 8 oo 8 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 Figure 2 . The terminal arrest phenotype of the rhol - 104 cells . Cells of the wild - type strain RAY - 3A - D ( A ) or HNY30 ( rho1 - 104 / rho1 - 104 ) ( B ) were grown exponentially at 24°C and the cultures were divided into two . One was incubated at 24°C for 3 h , while the other was incubated at 37°C for 3 h . More than 1 , 000 cells for each strain were observed by a light microscope and the morphology of each cell was determined . ( 1 ) unbudded cell , ( 2 ) tiny - or small - budded cell , ( 3 ) medium - budded cell , ( 4 ) large - budded cell . Large - budded cell had a bud larger than about two - thirds of its mother cell in volume . growth of the rhol - 104 ceils was retarded even at 24°C and was inhibited at 37°C ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) . Neither the cell number nor optical density of the culture significantly in - creased at 37°C in the rho1 - 104 mutant culture , suggesting that the rho1 - 104 cells had halted cell growth as well as cell division . To examine whether the arrested cells lose viability or not , viable cells were counted after temperature up - shift . As shown in Fig . 1 C , the rho1 - 104 mutant cells lost viability rapidly when incubated at 37°C , suggesting that the deficiency of cell surface growth of the arrested rho1 - 104 cells were mainly due to their loss of viability . Microscopic examination of the rho1 - 104 cells growing at 24°C revealed that cells with a tiny or small bud accumulated compared with the wild - type cells : 48 % of the rho1 - 104 cells versus 38 % of the wild - type cells ( Fig . 2 ) . In contrast , in the rhol - 104 cells arrested at 370C , the population of tiny - or small - budded cells increased up to 80 % , which presented a clear contrast to 34 % in the wild - type control culture ( Fig . 2 ) . To confirm that cell surface growth was inhibited at 37°C , length of the long axes of tiny - or small - budded cells was measured in more than 500 cells of the rho1 - 104 mutant and wild - type cells . The average cell length of the rho1 - 104 cells grown at 24°C was not longer than that of the wild - type cells grown at 24°C and did not change after incubation at 370C for 6 h ( data not shown ) . Cells of the rho1 - 104 mutant and the RHOl - depleted mu - tant grown under the permissive conditions or arrested under nonpermissive conditions were stained with rhodamine phalloidin and DAPI to visualize actin and DNA , respec - tively , by fluorescence microscopy ( Fig . 3 ) . In both mutant cells arrested as tiny - or small - budded cells , cortical actin patches were concentrated to budding sites or in buds ( Fig . 3 , A and B , A _ can ) as described in tiny - or small - budded cells of the wild - type strain ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ) . Tiny - budded cells were more frequently The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 125 , 1994 1080 seen in the rhol - 104 cells ( , ~ 70 % of tiny - budded cells and 30 % of small - budded cells ) than in the RHOl - depleted cells ( ' ~ 30 % of tiny - budded cells and 70 % of small - budded ceils ) ( data not shown ) . Staining with DAPI showed that the rhol - 104 cells arrested at 37°C had a single nucleus ( Fig . 3 , A and B , DNA ) . To examine the state of nuclear DNA further , flow cytometric analysis was conducted to determine the DNA content of the arrested ceils of the rho1 - 104 mutant ( Fig . 4 ) . Cells of the wild - type strain RAY - 3A - D or rho1 - 104 mutant strain HNY30 ( rho1 - 104 / rho1 - 104 ) growing exponentially at 24°C were further incubated at 24 , 33 , or 37°C for 5 h . 65 , 45 , and 40 % of the wild - type cells showed 4 - n peaks when incubated at 24 , 33 , and 37°C , respectively ( Fig . 4 A ) . In contrast , 70 , 95 , and 65 % of the rho1 - 104 mutant cells showed 4 - n peaks when incubated at 24 , 33 , and 37°C , respectively . These results indicate that the nuclear cycle of the rho1 - 104 cells was not arrested in a cell cycle - specific manner at 37°C , but was arrested at the G2 / M phase at 33°C . Cell cycle arrest at the small - budded stage has been ob - served with a mutant in PKC1 which is a yeast homologue of mammalian protein kinase C of an a / 3 ~ / type ( Levin and Bartlett - Heubusch , 1992 ) . Since cell lysis phenotype has also been found in the pkcl mutant , cell lysis of the rhol - 104 or RHOl - depleted cells was examined by assaying alkaline phosphatase activity which was normally localized to vacu - oles ( Fig . 5 ) . This method was used to detect the cell lysis phenotype of the pkcl mutant ( Paravicini et al . , 1992 ) . Sub - stantial activity of alkaline phosphatase was detected in the RHOl - depleted cells incubated in YPD medium for 16 h ( Fig . 5 B ) and in the rhol - 104 cells incubated at 37°C for 1 h ( Fig . 5 , C and D ) . Although cell lysis was not microscopi - cally evident in the rhol mutant cultures , the temperature - sensitive pkcl mutant was also found to release intracellular materials without apparent cell lysis at the restrictive tem - perature ( Levin and Bartlett - Heubusch , 1992 ) . The lethality caused by the cell lysis phenotype of the pkcl mutant has been found to be suppressed by an osmotic stabilizer such as 1 M sorbitol ( Levin and Bartlett - Heubuseh , 1992 ) . In contrast , the lethality of the rhol disruption mutant was not suppressed by the presence of I M sorbitol in the medium , although the rhol - 104 temperature - sensitive mutant cells grew at 37°C in the presence of 1 M sorbitol ( Fig . 6 ) . Suppression of the Growth Deficiency of the rhol Mutant by Expression of Mammalian RhoA Among the mammalian small G proteins , the mammalian RhoA protein is the most similar to the yeast Rholp ( Madaule et al . , 1987 ) . We examined whether expression of the RhoA gene could replace the function of the RH01 gene . For this purpose , human RhoA eDNA was cloned into a yeast single copy expression vector , YCp - LEU2 - GAL1 . The resulting plasmid , YCp - LEU2 - GAL1 - RhoA , expressed RhoA under control of the GA / _ J promoter . A strain KTll0 - 1A carried the rhol gene disrupted with HIS3 and the result - ing lethality was suppressed by the presence of the plasmid pMM105 , a URA3 - bearing single copy plasmid containing the GALIO - RH01 gene . KTI10 - 1A was transformed with YCp - LEU2 - GAL1 - RHO1 , YCp - LEU2 - GAL1 - RhoA , or a vector plasmid , YCp - LEU2 - GAL1 . Transformants which grew on the SG - ura - leu medium at 30°C were streaked on the SG - ura - leu medium containing uracil and 5 - FOA . The plate was subsequently incubated at 240C for 4 d . Since 5 - FOA inhibits the growth of Ura ÷ cells , only cells that had lost pMM105 should grow on the 5 - FOA - containing me - dium . As shown in Fig . 7 , cell growth on the 5 - FOA - contain - ing medium was seen with cells bearing YCp - LEU2 - GAL1 - RhoA as well as YCp - LEU2 - GAL1 - RHO1 . Therefore , ex - pression of RhoA suppressed the growth deficiency of the rhol disruption mutant , although the suppression was not seen when incubated at 37°C ( data not shown ) . Suppression of growth deficiency of the rhol disruption mutant was also seen with a single copy plasmid carrying the RhoA gene un - der the control of the RH01 promoter ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that mammalian RhoA is functionally homologous to yeast Rhol protein , in addition to the struc - tural homology . lntraceUular Localization of Rholp Phenotypic analysis of the rhol - 104 temperature - sensitive mutant and the RHOl - depleted mutants suggested that RH01 is involved in the process of bud growth . Indirect im - munofluoreseence method was used to reveal the intracellu - lar localization of Rholp . For this purpose , oligonucleotides encoding the HA epitope of influenza hemagglutinin were added to the 5 ' end of the RH01 open reading frame . The promoter region of the RH01 gene of this construct was kept intact not to alter the expression level of the Rtt01 gene . This RIt01 gene tagged with the HA epitope was cloned into a single copy vector , pRS316 , and an integration vector , pRS306 , to construct plasmids pRS316 - HA - RHO1 and pRS306 - HA - RHOI , respectively . Plasmid pRS316 - HA - RHO1 suppressed the temperature - sensitive growth pheno - type of HNY30 ( rho1 - 104 / rho1 - 104 ) as well as the lethality of TM2 - 1A - D ( rhol : : HIS3 / rhol : : HIS3 ) . The lethality of TM2 - 1A - D was also suppressed by integrating pRS306 - HA - RHO1 at the rhol : : HIS3 locus . These rhol mutant cells expressing HA - RH01 were morphologically indistinguishable from the wild - type cells . These results indicate that HA - Rholp func - tions as wild - type Rholp . Cells of three strains described above carrying the HA - RH01 gene were grown at 30°C and processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopic analysis . To visualize the HA - Rhol protein , ceils were stained with 12CA5 mAb and subsequently with the FITC - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG antibody . The same preparation was doubly stained with rhodamine phalloidin to visualize actin . The results are shown in Fig . 8 . Distribution of cortical actin patches at specific stages of cell cycle is well established in S . cerevisiae ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ) . In the small unbudded cells , cortical actin patches distributed randomly on the cell surface ( Fig . 8 , A , B , and C , 1 , Actin ) and the staining with 12CA5 mAb was seen in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 8 , A , B , and C , 1 , HA - Rholp ) . This is consistent with the result that the substantial portion of HA - Rholp was pres - ent in the cytosolic fraction as estimated by Western blot analysis ( see below ) . However , at least a part of the staining with 12CA5 was due to nonspecific staining , since 12CA5 mAb similarly stained the cytoplasm of cells which did not express the HA epitope ( Fig . 8 , A , B , and C , 1 , Control ) . In the large unbudded cells , cortical actin patches were con - centrated at the site where budding would occur ( Fig . 8 , A , B , and C , 2 , Actin ) . In these cells , HA - Rholp was found to be eoloealized with cortical actin patches , although HA - Rholp was stained uniformly at the periphery of cells ( Fig . Yamochi et al .

Asynchronous culture of a diploid strain HNY30 ( rhol - lO4 / rhol - 104 ) grown at 24°C was further incubated at 24°C or at 37°C for 3 h . Asynchronous culture of a diploid strain TM2 - 1A - D ( rhol : : HIS3 / rhol : : HIS3 ) grown at 30°C in YPGal medium was further incubated in YPGal or in YPD medium for 15 h . Fixed cells were then stained with rhodamine phalloidin ( Actin ) and with DAPI ( DNA ) , and the stained ceils were observed under a light ( Phase contrast ) or fluorescence microscope . Tiny buds of the rho1 - 104 cells arrested at 37°C are shown with arrowheads . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 125 , 1994 1082 Yamoehi et al .

Flow cytometric analysis of DNA contents was subsequently conducted on these cells . 8 , A , B , and C , 2 , HA - Rholp ) . In cells forming small buds , cortical actin patches were localized into the buds as well as to the budding sites ( Fig . 8 , A , B , and C , 3 , Actin ) . In these cells , HA - Rholp was localized to the periphery covering the entire buds ( Fig . 8 , A , B , and C , 3 , HA - Rholp ) . In cells with larger buds in which cortical actin patches were concentrated towards the bud tips ( Fig . 8 , A , B , and C , 4 , Actin ) , staining of Ha - Rholp was also dense around the bud tips ( Fig . 8 , A , B , and C , 4 , HA - Rholp ) . It is known that cortical actin patches randomly redistribute throughout mother and daugh - ter cells after the G2 phase , but before cytokinesis ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ) . ( Fig . 8 , A , B , and C , 5 , Actin ) . Staining of HA - Rholp was hardly seen in these cells ( Fig . 8 , A , B , and C , 5 , HA - Rholp ) . Follow - ing mitosis , cortical actin patches became clustered at the mother - bud neck region before cytokinesis ( Fig . 8 , A , B , and C , 6 , Actin ) . HA - Rholp was localized again at the periphery of cells where cortical actin patches clustered in these cells Figure 5 . Cell lysis phenotype of the rhol mutants . Wild - type strainRAY - 3A - D ( A ) , rhol disruption mutant TM2 - IA - D ( B ) , and rhol - 104 temperature - sensitive mutants of a haploid strain HNY21 ( C ) and of a diploid strain HNY30 ( D ) were streaked on YPD plate , incubated at 24°C for 15 h , and then incubated further at 37°C for 1 h . The patches were stained with a chromogenic substrate , BCIE of alkaline phosphatase for 15 h at 25°C . Figure 6 . Suppression of the temperature - sensitive growth pheno - type of the rho1 - 104 cells by osmotic stabilizer . The wild - type strain RAY - 3A - D ( WT ) , rhol disruption mutant TM2 - 1A - D ( rhol : : HIS3 ) , and rho1 - 104 temperature - sensitive mutant HNY30 ( rhol ~ ) were streaked on YPD and YPD + I M sorbitol media and incubated at 37°C for 3 d . Residual growth of TM2 - 1A - D seems to be due to a time lag for the repression of the GAL / promoter . ( Fig . 8 , A , B , and C , 6 , HA - Rholp ) . The staining of HA - Rholp at the cytokinesis site raised a possibility that unbudded cells with HA - Rholp colocalized with cortical actin patches were in the postcytokinetic stage . To answer this question , the ap - pearance of HA - Rholp at the presumptive budding site was observed on cells emerging from stationary phase . Cells of HNY30 carrying pRS316 - HA - RHO1 were grown to station - ary phase in YPD medium and released into fresh YPD me - dium for 1 h . Ceils with HA - Rholp colocalized with actin patches at the presumptive budding site significantly increased after the 1 - h incubation ( data not shown ) . Therefore , it seems that HA - Rholp colocalized with actin patches in cells at the budding stage . Among ~ 500 cells observed in each HA - Rholp - express - ing strain , more than 70 % of cells in large unbudded , small - budded , medium - budded , or cytokinetic cell cycle stage were stained at the growth site as shown in Fig . 8 , while no such staining was observed in more than 500 observed cells of each strain carrying the RItO1 gene in place of the HA - RttOI gene . Representatives of these control cells are shown ( Fig . 8 , A , B , andC , 1 - 6 , Control ) . Fractionation of Rholp into Both Cytosolic and Pam ' culate Fractions Results shown in Fig . 8 suggested that at least a part of HA - Rholp might be localized to the plasma membrane . To exam - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 125 , 1994 1084 Figure 7 . Suppression of the growth deficiency of the rhol disruption mutant by expression of the human RhoA gene . KTll0 - 1A ( rhol : : HIS3 pMM105 ) , whose lethality was suppressed by the galactose - dependent expression of RH01 on a URA3 - bearing single copy vec - tor , was transformed with YCp - LEU2 - GAL1 - RHO1 ( RH01 ) , YCp - LEU2 - GAL1 - RhoA ( RhoA ) , or YCp - LEU2 - GAL1 ( Vector ) . The resulting transformants were streaked on SG - ura - leu medium con - taining 5 - FOA and uracil . The plate after 4 d incubation at 24°C is shown . ine this point , Western blot analysis was performed with 12CA5 mAb on the cytosolic and particulate fractions ob - tained by centrifugation at 100 , 000 g from cells of HNY30 bearing pRS316 - HA - RHO1 or pRS316 - RHO1 ( Fig . 9 ) . A protein with an Mr value of 26 kD was detected from cells expressing HA - RHOI , but not from cells expressing RH01 , indicating that the 26 - kD protein was HA - Rholp ( Fig . 9 , A and B ) . About 70 % of HA - Rholp was found in the cytosolic fraction ( Fig . 9 A , lane 2 ) , while 30 % of HA - Rholp was found in the particulate fraction ( Fig . 9 A , lane 3 ) . HA - Rholp in the particulate and cytosolic fractions probably repre - sented HA = Rholp stained at the sites of cell growth and cytoplasm in the immunofluorescence microscopy shown in Fig . 8 , respectively . Another protein with an Mr value of 50 kD was detected from both HA - RH01 - and RHOl - expressing cells ( Fig . 9 , A and B ) . Since the 50 - kD protein was detected only in the 100 , 000 g supernatant fractions , we presumed that the nonspecific staining of the cytoplasm with 12CA5 mAb in the immunofl . uorescence microscopy shown in Fig . 8 might be due to this 50 - kD protein . Requirement of Posttranslational Modifications for the Function and Localization of Rholp Most small G proteins including Rholp undergo posttransla - tional modifications including the attachment of lipid moie - ties to cysteine residues at the carboxyl terminus ( Katayama et al . , 1991 ; Qadota et al . , 1992 ) . To examine whether these modifications are important for the function and localization of Rholp , the cysteine residue at amino acid position 206 was changed to serine by use of the in vitro mutagenesis tech - nique . The HA - rhol ( C206S ) gene was cloned into a single copy plasmid pRS316 and the resulting plasmid , pRS316 - HA - rhol ( C206S ) , was transformed into the strain HNY30 ( rho1 - 104 / rho1 - 104 ) . The transformants did not grow at 37°C , indicating that HA - rhol ( C206S ) p was not functional . Cells of a transformant were grown in a rich medium at 24°C and were stained with rhodamine phalloidin and with 12CA5 mAb . As shown in Fig . 10 ( rhol [ C206Slp , HA ) , no particu - lar staining with 12CA5 was observed except that the cytoplasm was stained to a certain extent , suggesting that HA - rhol ( C206S ) p remained in the cytoplasm . Western blot analysis indicated that most of HA - rhol ( C206S ) p was pres - ent in the cytosolic fraction ( Fig . 9 C , lanes 2 and 3 ) . These results indicate that the posttranslational modifications of Rholp are essential for Rholp to localize to the site of cell growth , where , most probably , Rholp performs its function . A Saturable Binding Site for Rholp at the Growth Site The results described above suggest that there may be a specific binding site for Rholp at the plasma membrane in the sites of cell growth . To examine whether the binding site is saturable , we transformed HNY30 with a multicopy plas - mid YEp352 - HA - RHO1 , which overexpressed HA - Rholp . Although very high expression of RItOI by a strong pro - moter was detrimental to the growth of cells , overexpression with the RHO1 promoter on a multicopy plasmid affected neither the rate of cell growth nor the cell morphology ( data not shown ) . Western blot analysis demonstrated that HA - Rholp was overexpressed about three - to fivefold both in the cytosolic and particulate fractions ( Fig . 9 D , lanes 2 and 3 ) . The increase of the overexpressed HA - Rholp in the cytosolic fraction might not simply be due to the incomplete posttrans - lational modifications of HA - Rholp , because HA - Rholp fully underwent the posttranslational modifications in the HA - RHO1 overexpressing strain , as estimated by the SDS - PAGE method described previously ( Mizuno et ai . , 1991 ) , in which the posttranslationally modified RhoA migrates faster than the posttranslationally unmodified RhoA . Trans - formants were processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with 12CA5 mAb and for staining with rhoda - mine phalloidin . As shown in Fig . 10 ( Rholp , overpro - duced ) , overexpression of HA - RH01 did not significantly affect the distribution of cortical actin patches ( Actin ) , while the staining of HA - Rholp was seen at the almost entire pe - riphery of cells as well as in the cytoplasm irrespective of cell cycle stage ( HA ) . This result suggests that the overex - pressed Rholp which was recovered as the particulate frac - tion nonspecifically bound to the plasma membrane region . Therefore , the Rholp - binding site at the growth site seems to be saturable and there may be a specific protein which binds to Rholp at the sites of cell growth . Discussion Isolation of a temperature - sensitive mutation of the RHO1 gene has revealed that RH01 is required for the budding pro - cess . The rhol - 104 ceils were arrested in the cell cycle as tiny - or small - budded cells and no cell surface growth occurred after arrest . Since the phenotype was seen in the Rtt01 - Yamoehi et al .

Cells of HNY30 ex - pressing HA - RH01 on a single copy plasmid ( A ) , RH01 on a single copy plasmid ( B ) , HA - rhol ( C206S ) on a single copy plasmid ( C ) , and HA - RH01 on a multicopy plasmid ( D ) were grown asyn - chronously in YPD medium at 30°C except for cells expressing HA - rhol ( C206S ) , which were cultured at 24°C . Crude homogenates ( lane 1 ) were prepared and fraetionated into cytosolic ( lane 2 ) and particulate fractions ( lane 3 ) at 100 , 000 g . Protein samples were subjected to SDS - PAGE and separated proteins were processed for Western blot analysis with 12CA5 mAb as described in Materials and Methods , The protein markers used were phosphorylase ( B ) ( Mr = 97 , 400 ) , bovine serum albumin ( Me = 69 , 000 ) , ovalbumin ( Mr = 46 , 000 ) , carbonic anhydrase ( Mr = 30 , 000 ) , trypsin inhibi - tor ( Mr = 21 , 500 ) , and lysozyme ( Mr = 14 , 300 ) . An arrowhead indicates the HA - Rhol proteins . depleted mutant , arrest with tiny - or small - budded cells might be caused by the loss of function of Rholp . The mor - phological phenotype of rho1 - 104 was different from those of previously described cdc mutants : many of the cdc mutants that have entered the cell division cycle continue cell growth after division has been arrested ( Hartwell et al . , 1974 ; Prin - gle and Hartwell , 1981 ) . Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the nuclear cycle of the rho1 - 104 mutant was not arrested in a cell cycle - specific manner at 37°C , but was arrested at the G2 / M phase at 330C . We favor a hypothesis that the rhol - 104 mutation indirectly caused the arrest of the nuclear cy - cle , because Rholp was localized at the sites of cell growth , not around the nuclei . Arrest of the nuclear cycle and cell growth in the rho1 - 104 cells may be caused by the rapid loss of viability at the restrictive temperature . We have noted that the phenotypes of the rhol mutant are similar to those of the two previously described mutants , cdcl and pkcl . The cdcl mutant arrests its cell division with unbudded or tiny - budded cells and loses cell viability rapidly at the restrictive temperature ( Hartwell , 1971 ; Pringle and Hartwell , 1981 ) . The cdcl mutant could complete DNA syn - thesis , but not nuclear division , as the rho1 - 104 mutant ar - rested at 330C ( Hartwell , 1971 ; Pringle and Hartwell , 1981 ) . Although the RH01 gene did not complement the cdcl muta - tion even on a multicopy plasmid ( data not shown ) , CDC1 might encode a protein which functions in the RH01 - mediated signalling pathway . The PKC1 gene encodes a yeast homologue of mammalian protein kinase C of c¢33 , type ( Levin and Bartlett - Heubusch , 1992 ) . Cells of the galactose - dependent pkcl mutant arrests as small - budded cells which are not detectably enlarged . It has been also shown that temperature - sensitive pkcl mutant cells lose their viability at the restrictive temperature as rapidly as the rho1 - 104 mutant cells did . This rapid loss of viability in the pkcl mutant has been shown to be caused by cell lysis which could be sup - pressed by osmotic stabilizer ( Levin and Bartlett - Heubusch , 1992 ) . We have noted that the rho1 - 104 and RHOl - depleted mutants also show the cell lysis phenotype under the restric - tive conditions . Recently , we have isolated a gene which sup - presses the temperature - sensitive growth phenotype of the rhol mutant at 30°C on a multicopy vector . DNA sequencing of this gene have revealed that it is identical to PPZ2 , encod - ing a type 1 protein phosphatase ( T . Musha , K . Tanaka , H . Nonaka , and Y . Takai , manuscript in preparation ) . The PFZ2 gene has been also isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the pkcl mutant ( Lee et al . , 1993 ) , indicating that RH01 is functionally relevant to PKC1 . One major phenotypic difference between rhol and pkcl mutants is that cell growth of a gene disruptant of PKC1 , but not of RH01 , is supported by osmotic stabilizer such as 1 M sorbitol . RH01 plays an essential role in the bud growth and a part of the RH01 func - tion may be related to the osmotic integrity which is con - trolled by the PKC1 gene . Epitope tagging method enabled us to demonstrate the in - tracellular localization of Rholp . Rholp was stained uni - formly at the sites of cell growth where cortical actin patches clustered . Consistently , Rholp was found to be localized at the tip of shmoo - like region in the cdc28 - 13 mutant cells incubated at 37°C ( data not shown ) . In contrast , the rhol - ( C206S ) mutant protein seemed to remain in the cytoplasm . The rhol ( C206S ) protein has an amino acid substitution at the cysteine residue that receives posttranslational modifica - tions which are important for membrane binding of GTP - binding proteins . Therefore , Rholp appears to bind to the plasma membrane or vesicles near the plasma membrane . We have recently shown that the posttranslational modifica - tions are also required for a small G protein to activate its target protein . The posttranslational modifications are essen - tial for Rac to activate the superoxide generation ( Ando et al . , 1992 ) and for Ras to activate adenylate cyclase in S . cerevisiae ( Horiuchi et al . , 1992 ) and MAP kinase in Xeno - pus laevis ( Itoh et al . , 1993 ) . Therefore , there seems to be a target protein for Rholp at the sites of cell growth . It has previously been reported by immunofluorescence micros - copy that Rholp is detected as a punctate pattern , with the signal concentrated toward the cell periphery and in the buds ( McCaffrey et al . , 1991 ) . These stained regions have been Figure 8 . Intracellular localization of the Rhol protein .

Cells were then fixed and processed for costaining with rhodamine phalloidin ( Actin ) and with 12CA5 mAb ( HA - Rholp ) as described in Materials and Methods .

Yamochi et al . Rholp in Bud Growth 1089 Figure 10 . Intracellular localization of HA - rhol ( C206S ) mutant protein and overexpressed HA - Rholp . HNY30 ( rho1 - 104 / rho1 - 104 ) cells bearing the HA - rhol ( C206S ) gene on a single copy plasmid ( rhol ( C206S ) p ) or the HA - RHOI gene on a multicopy plasmid ( P , holp , over - produced ) were fixed and costained with rhodarnine phalloidin ( Actin ) and with 12CA5 mAb ( HA ) as described in Materials and Methods . Cells at various cell cycle stages ( 1 - 6 ) as in Fig . 8 are shown . proposed to be post - Golgi vesicles by subcellular fraction - ation experiments ( McCaffrey et al . , 1991 ) . HA - Rholp was also stained at the peripheral regions of buds in our im - munofluorescence microscopic study . However , we did not see any vesicle - like staining pattern of HA - Rholp . Although we do not know the reason for this discrepancy , the punctate staining pattern of Rholp observed by McCaffrey et al . ( 1991 ) might be due to cross - reaction of the polyclonal anti - Rholp antibody with Rholp - like protein , such as Cdc42p , Rho2p , Rho3p , or Rho4p . In mammalian cells , it has been The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 125 , 1994 1090 demonstrated that RhoA is present in the both cytosolic and particulate fractions as in yeast ceils , and immunofluores - cence microscopy has revealed that RhoA is present in the cytoplasm and that no particular intracellular regions have been stained ( Adamson et al . , 1992 ) . Further detailed studies are required to know whether RhoA is present in any particular intracellular space ( s ) . Western blot analysis demonstrated that (cid:127)70 and 30 % of HA - Rholps were present in the 100 , 000 g cytosolic fraction and in the particulate fraction , respectively . In mammalian cells , the cytosolic RhoA has been found to be complexed with Rho GDI , which is a GDI for GTP - bindlng proteins of the Rho family including RhoA ( Kuroda et al . , 1992 ; Regazzi et al . , 1992 ) . Thus , we presume that the cytosolic Rholp may be complexed with a counterpart of Rho GDI in yeast . In fact , we have recently found that there is a substan - tial Rho GDI - like activity in the cytosolic fraction of yeast cells ( T . Masuda , K . Tanaka , H . Nonaka , W . Yarnochi , A . Maeda , and Y . Takai , manuscript in preparation ) . If the cytosolic Rholp is complexed with Rho GDI , it might be in the GDP - bound form , since Rho GDI preferentially interacts with the GDP - bound form of Rho proteins ( Hori et al . , 1991 ; Mizuno et al . , 1991 ; Takai et al . , 1992 ) . On the contrary , Rholp localized at the sites of cell growth should be in the GTP - bound form , since it is well established that small G proteins are active in the GTP - bound form and are inactive in the GDP - bound form . It may be noted that McCaffrey et al . ( 1991 ) has reported that , x , 20 and 80 % of Rholps are pres - ent in the 100 , 000 g cytosolic fraction and in the particulate fraction , respectively . This result is inconsistent with our re - sult that HA - Rholp was mostly present in the cytosolic frac - tion . The exact reason for the discrepancy between their and our results is not known at present , but our result is more likely because of the following two reasons : ( a ) we have pre - viously shown that the substantial amount of RhoA is present in the cytosolic fraction in a complex with Rho GDI in bo - vine aortic smooth muscle ( Kawahara et al . , 1990 ; Kuroda et al . , 1992 ) ; and ( b ) McCaffrey et al . ( 1991 ) have quanti - tated Rholp by measuring the ADP - ribosylation of Rholp . We have previously shown that the ADP - ribosylation of RhoA is inhibited by Rho GDI , which is present in the cyto - solic fraction in a complex with RhoA ( Kikuchi et al . , 1992 ) . Therefore , McCaffrey et al . ( 1991 ) might underestimate the amount of cytosolic Rholp . It has not been clarified to which protein Rholp is bound at the sites of cell growth . This protein , which might be a target protein of Rholp , was clearly limited in amount since overexpressed Rholp was nonspecifically localized to the pe - riphery of cells . How is Rholp localized to the sites of cell growth ? We presume that Cdc42p may play a crucial role in this process . A temperature - sensitive mutant defective in the CDC42 gene is unable to bud at restrictive temperatures , but continues growth and the nuclear cycle of DNA synthesis and nuclear division ( Adams et al . , 1990 ; Johnson and Pringle , 1990 ) . Thus , this cdc42 mutant arrests development as large , unbudded cells that often contain two or more nuclei . Con - sistently , staining of cdc42 mutant cells with rhodamine phalloidin results in an uniform distribution of cortical actin patches ( Adams et al . , 1990 ) . We stained the cdc42 mutant cells expressing HA - Rholp with 12CA5 mAb and found that HA - Rholp was not localized to any specific site of arrested cells ( data not shown ) . Therefore , Cdc42p appears to regu - late the localization of Rholp or the Rholp - binding protein . Based on the results of immunofluorescence microscopy of Rholp and of phenotypic analysis of the rho1 - 104 mutant , we presume that Rholp plays an important role , directly or indirectly , in the process of localized cell growth , including vesicle fusion to the plasma membrane or cell wall growth at the bud tips . Since cell polarity was established in the ar - rested rhol mutant cells , Rholp seemed to function down - stream of Cdc42p . Another phenotypic difference between cdc42 and rhol mutants was that rhol mutants halted cell growth under the restrictive conditions , probably due to cell death . A possible cause for cell death may be lysis of the rhol mutant cells , whose molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated . Rholp was also stained in cells prior to or during cytokinesis . In these cells , staining was observed at the plasma membrane region at the mother - bud neck , where cortical actin patches were also concentrated . This result may suggest that Rholp plays a role in localized cell growth accompanying cytokinesis . In accordance with this , we have recently shown that the microinjection of C3 or Rho GDI inhibits the cytokinesis in Xenopus embryo ( Kishi et al . , 1993 ) . However , the rho1 - 104 cells arrested at nonpermissive temperature did not accumulate cells with large buds . Fur - ther investigations are needed with respect to the role of Rholp in cytokinesis . Suppression of the rho1 - 104 mutation by the expression of RhoA suggests that the function of RhoA is conserved in lower eukaryotes such as yeast . Although the precise mecha - nism has not been established yet , RhoA has been proposed to be involved in the reorganization of actin stress fibers in mammalian cells ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) . The GTP - bound form of RhoA rapidly stimulates the stress fiber and focal adhesion formation when microinjected into serum - starved Swiss 3T3 cells . Colocalization of Rholp with cortical actin patches raises a possibility that the function of Rholp is also somehow concerned with the actin cytoskeleton system in yeast . Although cortical actin patches were concentrated to tiny or small buds in the rho1 - 104 cells arrested at nonpermis - sive temperatures , it remains possible that Rholp is involved in the reorganization of the actin system after the cell polarity has been established . Identification of genes functionally in - teracting with RH01 may reveal a relationship between RH01 and the actin cytoskeleton system .
