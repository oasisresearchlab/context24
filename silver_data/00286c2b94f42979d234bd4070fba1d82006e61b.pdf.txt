Brief Summary : A wide testing strategy is effective in detecting asymptomatic COVID - 19 residents and HCP in a NH facing COVID - 19 outbreak . Symptomatic residents and HCP as well as asymptomatic HCP with negative testing may also play a role in the virus spread within the NH .

Efficacy of a Test - Retest Strategy in Residents and Health Care Personnel 1 of a Nursing Home facing a COVID - 19 Outbreak 2 3 4 Abstract 5 Objective : To assess the American Testing Guidance for Nursing Homes ( NHs ) - updated 6 May 19 , 2020 - with a new COVID - 19 case . 7 Design : Case investigation . 8 Setting and Subjects : All 79 residents and 34 Health Care Personnel ( HCP ) of a NH . 9 Methods : 7 days after identification of a COVID - 19 resident , all residents and HCP 10 underwent rRT - PCR testing for SARS - CoV - 2 with nasopharyngeal swabs . This was repeated 11 weekly in all previously negative subjects until the testing identified no new cases and in all 12 positive subjects until the testing was negative . COVID - 19 infection prevention and control 13 ( IPC ) measures were implemented in all residents and HCP with positive testing or with 14 COVID - 19 symptoms . Standard IPC was also implemented in all HCP . Six weeks after initial 15 testing , all residents underwent testing for ELISA - based IgG antibodies directed against the 16 SARS - CoV - 2 . Symptoms were serially recorded in residents and HCP . 17 Results : 36 residents had a positive RT - PCR at baseline and two at day 7 . Six HCP had a 18 positive RT - PCR at baseline and two at day 7 . No new COVID - 19 cases were diagnosed 19 later . Among the SARS - CoV - 2 - positive cases , six residents ( 16 % ) and three HCP ( 37 % ) were 20 asymptomatic during the 14 days before testing . Twenty - five residents ( 92 . 3 % ) and all 8 HCP 21 ( 100 % ) with a positive RT - PCR developed IgG antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 . Among the 22 residents and HCP always having tested negative , 2 ( 5 % ) and 5 ( 11 . 5 % ) developed IgG 23 antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 . These 2 residents had typical COVID - 19 symptoms before 24 and after testing and 2 / 5 HCP were asymptomatic before and after testing . 25 Conclusions and Implications : This study shows the validity of the updated American 26 Testing Guidance for Nursing Homes ( NHs ) . It suggests implementing COVID - 19 IPC in 27 both residents and HCP with positive testing or COVID - 19 symptoms and warns that 28 asymptomatic HCP with repeated negative RT - PCR testing can develop antibodies against 29 SARS - CoV - 2 . 30 31 Key words : COVID - 19 , nursing home , rRT - PCR , antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 32 Introduction 33 After identification of a COVID - 19 case in a Nursing Home ( NH ) , residents are at high risk 34 of serious illness and death from COVID - 19 , with a rapid and widespread transmission of 35 SARS - CoV - 2 . 1 , 2 The standard COVID - 19 diagnosis is based on SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid 36 testing by real - time reverse - transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) . 3 Residents 37 and health care personnel ( HCP ) with positive RT - PCR can be asymptomatic at the time of 38 testing and may contribute to transmission . 2 Control strategies focusing only on symptomatic 39 residents are therefore insufficient . This explains why the recent American Testing Guidance 40 for Nursing Homes recommends ( i ) testing of all residents and HCP in the NH if there is a 41 confirmed case of COVID - 19 and ( ii ) repeated weekly testing of all previously negative 42 residents until no new cases of COVID - 19 are detected for at least 14 days since the most 43 recent positive result . 4 44 Seroconversion with SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies generally occurs rapidly in adult subjects . 5 The 45 immune response to viruses may be influenced by aging , and seroconversion in frail older 46 subjects is uncertain . It is unclear whether residents and HCP with repeated negative testing 47 may develop antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 . 48 A study was carried out on all residents and HCP of a NH facing a COVID - 19 outbreak . The 49 aim was to assess clinical and serological parameters for the efficacy of infection prevention 50 and control ( IPC ) measures adapted to ( i ) symptoms and ( ii ) results of repeated testing . 51 Methods 52 Setting : Single NH 53 Participants : From March 3 rd to 6 th , 2020 , three NH residents were hospitalized for severe 54 non - respiratory COVID - 19 symptoms . All three developed respiratory symptoms ( cough with 55 fever and dyspnea ) 7 to 10 days after admission , and RT - PCR following nasopharyngeal swab 56 test confirmed COVID - 19 . Seven days after the first diagnosis , all residents or HCP were 57 enrolled in the study . 58 No ethics committee was required as this is an observational study . 59 60 Outcomes : COVID - 19 symptoms were examined for 14 days before the first test and then 61 followed daily for 6 weeks . 62 Nasopharyngeal testing for SARS - CoV - 2 using rRT - PCR was performed in all residents and 63 HCP . It was repeated weekly in all previously negative subjects until no new cases were 64 identified and in all positive subjects until testing was negative . 65 COVID - 19 IPC measures were applied in all residents and HCP with positive testing or with 66 new COVID - 19 symptoms , including diarrhoea , delirium , or falls . 67 Six weeks after initial testing , all residents and HCP underwent blood testing for IgG 68 antibodies directed against the SARS - CoV - 2 nucleocapsid protein using an ELISA CE - IVD 69 marked kit ( ID screen ® SARS - CoV - 2 - N IgG indirect ID . Vet , Montpellier , France ) . 5 70 Results 71 Residents 72 Among the 79 residents , 38 ( 48 % ) had a positive RT - PCR ( Table 1 ) . 36 were diagnosed at 73 baseline and two at day 7 . The residents who tested positive were distributed throughout the 74 4 floors of the NH ( 10 , 9 , 10 , 9 ) . 75 The mean age of residents was similar in positive and negative RT - PCR groups . Diabetes and 76 renal disease were more common in RT - PCR positive residents . 77 Thirteen residents died two to seven days after testing due to respiratory symptoms . Twelve 78 ( 7 men ) had a positive RT - PCR . Six RT - PCR - positive residents ( 16 % ) were asymptomatic 79 before testing . 80 Six weeks after initial testing , seven residents still had at least one typical COVID - 19 81 symptom ( particularly fever or cough ) or a significant functional impairment . Among them , 5 82 ( 83 % ) were RT - PCR - positive . 83 The RT - PCR test became negative 14 , 21 , or 28 days after initial positive testing in 2 ( 14 % ) , 84 7 ( 27 % ) , and 12 ( 46 % ) residents . In the 5 ( 19 % ) who still had positive RT - PCR 28 days after 85 initial testing , one recovered completely and 4 had long - lasting symptoms ( fever and 86 hypothermia ; shortness of breath ; dry cough ; impaired health status ) . 87 Health Care Personnel 88 Among the 34 HCP , 6 had positive RT - PCR at baseline and 2 at day 7 ( 23 . 5 % ) . No new 89 COVID - 19 diagnosis was made later . Two thirds of the positive RT - PCR HCP had COVID - 90 19 symptoms , often mild . 91 Seroconversion 92 Six weeks after nasopharyngeal testing , 25 residents ( 92 . 3 % ) and all 8 HCP ( 100 % ) with 93 positive RT - PCR developed SARS - CoV - 2 IgG antibodies . Two ( 5 % ) RT - PCR negative 94 residents and 5 ( 11 . 5 % ) RT - PCR negative HCP developed antibodies . All 2 residents and 3 / 5 95 HCPs had typical COVID - 19 symptoms . 96 Discussion 97 The present study shows the clinical efficacy of a symptom - and repeated testing - based 98 strategy in a NH facing a COVID - 19 outbreak . This experience validates the American 99 Testing Guidance for Nursing Homes updated in May 2020 . 4 100 All residents and HCP were tested and there was no selection bias . This study was conducted 101 before any other COVID - 19 cases had been detected in the county . The presence of 102 antibodies in residents and HCP is therefore almost certainly linked with the COVID - 19 103 outbreak in that NH . 104 In the present study , 16 % of residents and one third of HCP with positive RT - PCR were 105 asymptomatic in the 14 days before testing . This confirms that all residents and HCP should 106 be tested if there is a confirmed case of COVID - 19 , whatever the symptoms . 4 Two residents 107 and two HCP who tested negative at baseline were tested positive for COVID - 19 7 days after 108 baseline . This suggests that a repeated weekly testing of all previously negative residents and 109 HCP until no new COVID - 19 cases are identified is also essential in preventing the SARS - 110 CoV - 2 spread . 4 111 Positive RT - PCR was associated with a severe prognosis ( death in 32 % ) , especially in men 112 ( death in 58 % ) , confirming previous studies . 1 , 2 Among the 22 negative RT - PCR residents 113 presenting COVID - 19 symptoms , one died and the others recovered completely , suggesting 114 that severe COVID - 19 outcomes could be generally , but not always , predicted by positive 115 testing . 116 Testing remained positive for 3 weeks or more in two thirds of the RT - PCR positive residents . 117 One remained positive for 8 weeks , indicating that NHs facing a COVID - 19 outbreak should 118 be prepared to maintain prolonged protective measures in residents tested positive for SARS - 119 CoV - 2 . In accordance with our regional guidelines 6 , this NH was considered to be COVID - 120 19 - free when none of the residents and HCP were diagnosed within the 14 days after the last 121 positive result . COVID - 19 free NHs apply regional recommended measures to prevent any 122 further COVID entrance and spread . In our Occitanie region , these measures include 6 : 1 . 123 Checking that RT - PCR testing in HCP and visitors with COVID - 19 symptoms or in those 124 having had contact with COVID - 19 suspected or confirmed cases ( daily screening ) is 125 negative before entering the premises . 2 . Checking that RT - PCR testing in all new residents 126 and in all residents having spent more than 24 h outside the NH ( especially after 127 hospitalization ) is negative before entering . 3 . Checking that residents , HCP , and visitors 128 previously tested positive for COVID - 19 meet all 3 follow - up NH entrance criteria : ( i ) 129 resolution of fever ( without use of fever - reducing medications ) and of other COVID - 19 130 symptoms within the past 48 hours ; ( ii ) two consecutive negative RT - PCR results collected 131 ≥ 24 hours apart , ( iii ) the first control test collected at least 7 days after the positive testing or 132 7 days after the first COVID - 19 symptoms . 4 . Obliging visitors allowed to enter the NH to 133 sign a charter in which they agree to adhere to standard and transmission - based precautions to 134 prevent COVID - 19 spread in the NH ( systematic face mask wearing , hand hygiene , and 135 especially social distancing ) as well as a registry with contact details to facilitate testing and 136 contact tracing should a new case be diagnosed in the NH . 5 . Admission to a private room and 137 14 days of isolation for every new resident and every resident having left the NH for at least 138 24h ( especially after hospital stay ) . 6 . Testing of every resident having left the NH for less 139 than 24 hours ( especially for medical consultation ) 5 to 7 days after a possible contact with 140 COVID - 19 . 7 . Daily screening of all residents for COVID - 19 symptoms ( including atypical 141 symptoms ) and testing if there is any doubt . 8 . If regular testing of HCP , visitors , and 142 residents at high risk of encountering COVID - 19 subjects outside the NH ( health care 143 workers who have a care activity outside the NH , visitors of several NHs , hemodialysed 144 patients , etc… ) can be justified in regions with moderate or substantial community 145 transmission , this measure is not recommended in our region in which community 146 transmission is now considered as low . 147 Residents and HCP with positive RT - PCR developed IgG antibodies against the SARS - CoV - 148 2 in 96 % and 100 % , respectively , suggesting that most frail older adults living in a NH , as 149 well as the HCP , can produce an antibody response against SARS - CoV - 2 . 150 Two residents ( 5 % ) with negative RT - PCR developed antibodies and all had fever or 151 respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID - 19 in the 14 days before . This suggests that 152 residents with COVID - 19 symptoms should benefit from the same IPC strategy as residents 153 with positive RT - PCR , even if tested negative . Five HCP with negative testing developed 154 antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 ( 11 % ) and some of them had no COVID - 19 symptoms . This 155 suggests that if specific COVID - 19 IPC measures must be implemented in HCP with 156 confirmed or suspected COVID - 19 , all HCP should wear a facemask , even if asymptomatic 157 and with negative testing . 158 159 Conclusions and Implications 160 The present study supports the recent American testing guidance for NHs . It demonstrates that 161 ( i ) testing all NH residents and HCP as soon as a new case of COVID - 19 is diagnosed and ( ii ) 162 repeating tests in all previously negative subjects once a week until the testing identifies no 163 new COVID - 19 cases is effective in detecting asymptomatic COVID - 19 residents and HCP . 164 It also shows that ( iii ) proposing COVID - 19 IPC measures in residents and HCP tested 165 positive or with COVID - 19 symptoms and ( iv ) taking precautions in all other HCP should be 166 effective in blocking the dissemination of the virus in NHs facing a COVID - 19 outbreak . 167 168 Conflicts of Interest : The authors declare no conflicts of interest / Competing interests 169 170 171 172 References 173 1 .
