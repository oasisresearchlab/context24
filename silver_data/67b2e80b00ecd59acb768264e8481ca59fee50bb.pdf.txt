Partial molecular structures show that PIEZO1 is a bowl - shaped trimer with extended arms . Here we use cryo - electron microscopy to show that PIEZO1 adopts different degrees of curvature in lipid vesicles of different sizes . We also use high - speed atomic force microscopy to analyse the deformability of PIEZO1 under force in membranes on a mica surface , and show that PIEZO1 can be flattened reversibly into the membrane plane . By approximating the absolute force applied , we estimate a range of values for the mechanical spring constant of PIEZO1 . Both methods of microscopy demonstrate that PIEZO1 can deform its shape towards a planar structure . This deformation could explain how lateral membrane tension can be converted into a conformation - dependent change in free energy to gate the PIEZO1 channel in response to mechanical perturbations . Piezo channels are mechanosensitive , nonselective cation channels that mediate force - detection in eukaryotic cells 1 – 3 . They transduce mechanical stimuli in many different physiological processes , including touch sensation 3 – 11 . As a consequence , deficiency or gain - of - function mutations have been linked to diseases , underscoring their medical importance 12 – 15 . Piezo channels are large proteins ( > 2 , 500 amino acids ) with 38 pre - dicted transmembrane helices per subunit 1 . Several partial molecular structures of mouse PIEZO1 have recently been determined using cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) 16 – 18 . These structures show a triskelion - shaped homotrimer with a central pore module , a C - terminal extracellular domain and long , bent arms projecting away from the central threefold axis , with helical beams near the attachments of the arms to the pore module 16 ( Extended Data Fig . 1a ) . Transmembrane helix ( TM ) 37 and TM38 form the pore module . The arms are formed from TM13 to TM36 , which are arranged in six four - helical repeats ( Extended Data Fig . 1b ) . In cryo - EM structures , the detergent micelle follows a curved contour to satisfy the non - planar shape of PIEZO1 ( Extended Data Fig . 1a , bottom ) , and in lipid vesicles PIEZO1 causes the membrane to curve locally into a dome 16 . It has previously been suggested that the arms of PIEZO1 might act as levers to sense force for gating 18 – 20 , and a model for sensing membrane tension , through the change in in - plane area that results from dome - flattening , has previously been proposed 16 . Various mechanical stimuli 3 – 5 , 21 , 22 have been used to activate PIEZO1 that—when open—give rise to a single channel conductance of about 29 pS , with a substantial inactivation period 2 , 19 . These meth - ods of activation could be consistent with either of the classical mod - els for mechanical gating : the ‘lateral membrane tension’ model 16 , 21 – 26 ( Fig . 1a ) and the ‘tethered spring’ model 19 , 23 , 27 – 29 ( Fig . 1b ) . Owing to the complexity of cell membranes and membrane patches 30 , 31 and the potential multitude of pathways that lead to channel activation 19 , 20 , 32 , 33 , the quantitative and mechanistic identification of force transduction remains challenging . In this study , we analyse PIEZO1 channels in lipid vesicles of differ - ent sizes to determine how the radius of curvature of the vesicle influ - ences the shape of PIEZO1 . We also analyse PIEZO1 reconstituted into supported lipid membranes using high - speed atomic force microscopy ( HS - AFM ) , which can simultaneously provide structural and dynam - ical information on single biomolecules 34 , and—importantly for the investigation of a mechanosensitive channel—permits the application of controlled force during image acquisition 35 . These data characterize the structural response of PIEZO1 to mechanical force , the biologically relevant physical stimulus for this channel . Behaviour of PIEZO1 channels in lipid vesicles We used cryo - EM to study PIEZO1 channels embedded in vesicles that consisted of 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( POPC ) , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - l - serine ( DOPS ) and cho - lesterol at a 8 : 1 : 1 ( w : w : w ) ratio ( Fig . 2a ) . In the absence of PIEZO1 , these vesicles form spheres because the membrane bending energy is minimized 36 . Single PIEZO1 channels are visible in some of the vesicles ( Fig . 2a , inset ) . In projection , and when viewed down the pore axis , the arms bend at the elbow either clockwise or anticlockwise , depending on whether a channel is being viewed from its extracellular or its intra - cellular surface . PIEZO1 reconstitutes with a preferred orientation in which its extracellular surface faces the inside of a vesicle—probably owing to its intrinsic curvature . Averages of these projected views fit well to top and bottom views of the atomic model of PIEZO1 16 – 18 , which indicates that PIEZO1 reconstituted in vesicles has a structure similar to PIEZO1 in detergent 16 – 18 ( Fig . 2b ) . Viewed from the side , it is evident that PIEZO1 distorts vesicles into a teardrop shape , with the channel located at the region of highest cur - vature ( yellow arrowheads in Fig . 2a ) . Detailed inspection of individual channels shows density for the C - terminal extracellular domain inside the vesicle , and the intrinsic curvature of PIEZO1 distorting the vesicle away from its spherical shape to a surface that is more - highly curved locally ( Fig . 3a ) . This means that PIEZO1 is applying force onto the membrane , and that the membrane is applying force onto the chan - nel . To investigate this interaction , we identified 1 , 166 side views of PIEZO1 , binned them into groups according to vesicle size and gener - ated averaged images ( Fig . 3b ) . We then fit circles to a small segment of arc length centred on PIEZO1 and centred exactly opposite PIEZO1 ( Fig . 3c , Extended Data Fig . 2 , Methods ) . We define the radii of these circles as the radius of curvature ( R c ) of the inner and outer membrane leaflet projections , and the average value as the mid - membrane R c 1 Department of Anesthesiology , Weill Cornell Medicine , New York , NY , USA . 2 Department of Physiology and Biophysics , Weill Cornell Medicine , New York , NY , USA . 3 Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology and Biophysics , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , TheRockefeller University , New York , NY , USA . 4 These authors contributed equally : Yi - Chih Lin , Yusong R .

The data lead to two conclusions . First , PIEZO1 adopts different curvatures as a function of vesicle size . Second , in larger vesicles , PIEZO1 remains more - highly curved than the membrane at the opposite pole . In other words , PIEZO1 curvature persists , which implies that PIEZO1 probably exhibits some degree of curvature even in a planar membrane ( as R c approaches infinity ) in the absence of applied tension . These experiments show that PIEZO1 is capable of undergoing at least some degree of flattening in response to force applied through the membrane . In this case , the force originates from the vesicle - imposed curvature of a membrane with some degree of stiffness . In living cells , even larger forces may be expected , and may be mediated through lat - eral membrane tension 16 , 21 – 26 , attached tethers 19 , 23 , 27 – 29 or both . Next , we used HS - AFM to investigate whether PIEZO1 can change its shape in a reversible manner . HS - AFM of PIEZO1 in supported membranes HS - AFM imaging is mediated by raster - scanning the sample with a nanometric tip at the end of a cantilever that oscillates at resonance frequency ( about 600 kHz ) . The topography ( that is , the z dimension ) is a surface that is contoured by the same oscillation - setpoint amplitude ( A set ) , which must be smaller than the amplitude of the cantilever when it swings freely ( A free ) . The ratio of A set to A free defines how much the oscillation is damped through the sample interaction . Thus , at constant A free , lowering A set leads to a higher applied force ( F HS - AFM ) on each tap ( Fig . 4a ) . The peak force and average force during an oscillation cycle can be determined by the analysis of the force trajectories from exper - iment 37 or by numerical simulation 38 , 39 using the point - mass model 40 ( Extended Data Fig . 3 , Methods ) . In our HS - AFM setup , the average applied force ⟨ ⟩ − F ( ) HS AFM to the imaged objects can be approximated by ⟨ ⟩ ≈      −              − / F kA Q A A 2 1 ( 1 ) HS AFM free set free 2 1 2 in which k and Q are the cantilever spring constant and quality factor , respectively . Controlling the A set / A free ratio thus enables the physical manipulation of PIEZO1 while observing its structural changes in response to ⟨ ⟩ − F HS AFM . The use of this approximation to quantify an average force seems justified , because the peak force application— which exceeds ⟨ ⟩ − F HS AFM —is applied during a short period ( only around 200 ns ) ( Extended Data Fig . 3 ) , many orders of magnitude faster than the reaction rate of PIEZO1 19 . In these conditions , the channel is expected to respond to an average force , whereas the peak force can be considered as the upper bound . To investigate the morphology of PIEZO1 in HS - AFM images , we simulated the topography of PIEZO1 using the cryo - EM map of the protein in micelle ( Extended Data Fig . 1a bottom , Methods ) . Given the two - dimensional confinement of the channels in supported bilay - ers , topographies viewed from opposite faces of the three - fold axis result in either a bowl - shaped topography with central plug ( Fig . 4b top left , extracellular face ) or a dome - shaped topography ( Fig . 4b top right , intracellular face ) . The simulated topographies ( Fig . 4b top ) and height section profiles ( Fig . 4b bottom ) reveal a central protrusion from the membrane surface on the extracellular or intracellular face that is approximately 1 nm or approximately 9 nm high , respectively . Most notably , the extracellular face should ( owing to its bowl - shaped , web - like protein - membrane architecture ) produce a topography that features a triangular ring of ‘negative height’ between the C - terminal extracellular domain and the periphery of the arms , which is a recog - nizable feature that we term the halo . For HS - AFM , we found the best conditions were those in which PIEZO1 channels were reconstituted into small unilamellar vesicles of 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( POPE ) and 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - ( 1 ′ - rac - glycerol ) ( POPG ) ( at a ratio of 85 : 15 , w : w ) . These vesicles spread into a continuous , sup - ported lipid bilayer with embedded PIEZO1 channels . When imaged under both low ( about 20 pN ) and high ( about 50 pN ) scanning force , the extracellular face of PIEZO1 was identifiable by the halo that sur - rounds a central protruding cap , and three membrane - extended arms that reach out into the membrane plane ( Fig . 4c left two panels ) . The radial profile within the halo area of the extracellular PIEZO1 face imaged at about 50 pN highlights the three - fold symmetry of the chan - nel , with the three arms protruding with approximately 120° periodicity from a presumably suspended bilayer between the arms ( green trace in Fig . 4c right , Supplementary Video 1 ) . The intracellular face of PIEZO1 exhibits a featureless dome with around 8 . 2 - nm height above the mem - brane ( Fig . 4d ) . However , the dome - like intracellular face was observed only rarely , which is consistent with vesicles bursting on mica to expose the concave extracellular face of PIEZO1 to the tip of the HS - AFM . The experimental topographies ( Fig . 4c , d ) resemble qualitatively the simulated topographies ( Fig . 4b ) ; however , PIEZO1 viewed from the extracellular side matched the structure only when imaged at low force ( around 20 pN ) .

N At U r e | www . nature . com / nature Article reSeArcH Although HS - AFM tip convolution and uncertainties of the membrane level in the simulated topography can explain the differences in protru - sion dimension of the C - terminal extracellular domain or indentation depth of the bowl ( respectively ) , the experimental bowl radius of about 17 nm that was found when the channel was imaged at around 50 pN ( as compared to a radius of about 13 nm in the simulated topography ) could not be explained by such effects . This observation led us to realize that the PIEZO1 channel imaged at about 50 pN was more extended and flattened than the channel in the zero - force cryo - EM structure ( and HS - AFM topographies at low force ) . We therefore next examined these structural changes as a function of applied force . Force - induced conformational changes For PIEZO1 , we designed a force - sweep cycle during HS - AFM imaging through fine - tuning the A set / A free ratio 35 ( blue trace in Fig . 5a ) . When the imaging force is gradually increased up to approximately 60 pN by displacing the sample support towards the tip of the HS - AFM ( green trace in Fig . 5a ) , PIEZO1 channels undergo a circular expansion—as evidenced by the enlargement of the halo ( Fig . 5a top , Supplementary Video 2 ) . Upon lowering the force to about 30 pN , PIEZO1 channels return to their initial less - expanded conformation ( Fig . 5a top right ) . We extracted individual PIEZO1 channels from the HS - AFM mov - ies , performed 360 - fold symmetry averaging of each frame to elimi - nate effects dependent on scan direction and calculated kymographs to observe the force - dependent structural changes ( Fig . 5b ) . The contour of the halo demonstrates the reversible expansion of the PIEZO1 chan - nel as a function of image acquisition time and force ( Supplementary Video 3 ) . We calculated a normalized probability density map , which shows that the reversible ring expansion under an applied force is a general and reproducible property of the channels and that there is a maximum ring radius of around 17 ± 2 nm at about 55 pN ( Fig . 5c ) . A minority of channels ( which were not included in this analysis ) segregated into a second , larger subgroup ( Extended Data Fig . 4 ) . Although these channels had a radius about 6 nm larger than that of the majority of channels , the physical response to force was indistin - guishable between the two subgroups ( Extended Data Fig . 5 ) . The HS - AFM experiments show that PIEZO1 undergoes a cir - cular expansion in a direction radial to the pore axis when a com - pressive mechanical force is exerted parallel to the pore axis ( Fig . 5c ) . Qualitatively , this conformational change in PIEZO1 is consistent with the change in the mid - plane R c in the cryo - EM vesicle - imaging experiments ( Fig . 3d ) . In HS - AFM , because we approximate the force applied ( equation ( 1 ) , Extended Data Fig . 3 ) as a function of the sam - ple displacement towards the HS - AFM tip ( Fig . 5d ) , we can estimate the mechanical properties of the channel . In the analysis that follows , we approximate the structure of PIEZO1 as a dome or spherical cap to represent the three curved arms that extend from the central pore , with a web of membrane in between them 16 . For a spherical cap with fixed area ( A ) and bending modulus ( k ) , the energy to bring about a deformation of the cap away from its intrinsic ( zero - force ) R c ( denoted as R 0 ) to a new R c can be expressed as 16 , 36 =   −    E R Ak R R ( ) 1 2 2 2 ( 2 ) c c 0 2 From the geometric relationship for a spherical cap of A = 2 π R c z ( ref . 41 ) ( in which z is the height of the cap above the membrane plane ) , we can express equation ( 2 ) as a function of z = π − E z k A z z ( ) 8 ( ) ( 3 ) 2 0 2 in which z 0 is the height of the cap in the absence of force . During HS - AFM imaging , the force is applied in the z direction .

Equating F z ( z ) with ⟨ ⟩ − F HS AFM and Δ z with the displacement of the sample ( Methods ) , the force - displacement data for the HS - AFM data in Fig . 5a are shown with a line fit that corresponds to equation ( 4 ) ( Fig . 5d ) . Two quantities are extractable from this analysis . First , the area subtended by the data represents the work required to bring about the conforma - tional change from curved to flat ( green - shaded area in Fig . 5d ) , which would be about 200 pN nm or about 50 k B T ( if we use equation ( 1 ) to estimate the force ; k B = Boltzmann constant , T = temperature ) . Second , the slope of the line reports the stiffness constant ( K ) of the protein , which is about 7 . 0 pN nm − 1 or about 1 . 8 k B T nm − 2 . The stiff - ness constant is proportional to the ratio of the bending modulus to surface area ( k / A ) . With this relation in mind , it is notable that the PIEZO1 architecture is an outlier compared to other membrane pro - teins , with a uniquely large area that reflects a very low helical density in the membrane ( approximately 0 . 2 of a helix per square nanometre ) ( Extended Data Fig . 6 ) . The low - force projection radius ( 11 nm ) and height ( 5 nm ) pre - dict a surface area for the PIEZO1 dome of π ( 11 2 + 5 2 ) ≅ 460 nm 2 , whereas the fully flattened projection radius under high force ( about 17 nm ) predicts a PIEZO1 surface area of π ( 17 2 ) ≅ 900 nm 2 . We can think of two potential origins for this discrepancy . First , the cryo - EM structures do not resolve the first 12 transmembrane helices , pre - sumably because they are disordered . It is possible that these helices become ordered under force ; if this were the case , as PIEZO1 flattens out it might encompass a larger area than would be predicted on the basis of the cryo - EM structures . Further work will be needed to test this hypothesis . Second , the halo that surrounds PIEZO1 extends into the membrane beyond the observed limits of the protein 42 . Again , fur - ther work will be needed to better understand the origins of the halo . These uncertainties notwithstanding , it is clear that PIEZO1 is com - pressible to a flatter structure under force and that this compressibility is reversible . Discussion The specific changes we observe in PIEZO1 are reversible and perfectly suited to rendering the channel sensitive to lateral membrane tension . This is because flattening produces an expansion of the in - plane area , and the difference in the in - plane area exhibited by two states of a pro - tein is precisely a quantity that converts lateral membrane tension into a difference in free energy . For the difference in free energy between a flat and curved PIEZO1 embedded in a membrane with lateral membrane tension ( γ ) , we have Δ Δ γ γΔ = = − G G A ( 0 ) ( 5 ) in which Δ G ( γ = 0 ) is the difference in free energy between the flat and curved conformations in the absence of lateral tension , and Δ A is the difference in the in - plane ( projected ) area between the confor - mations 16 . Δ G equals 0 when γΔ A offsets Δ G ( γ = 0 ) . The flat and curved conformations will be equally probable ( that is , in balanced equilibrium ) when the following relationship holds γ Δ γ Δ = = G A ( 0 ) ( 6 ) Using equation ( 1 ) to estimate force , the HS - AFM experiments indicate that it takes about 50 k B T to flatten PIEZO1 .

If the flattened conformation is associated with an open pore , then the channel will have an open probability 0 . 5 at this mem - brane tension . This tension value is not far from half - activation ten - sions that have previously been reported , of between 0 . 35 k B T nm − 2 ( ref . 21 ) and 1 . 2 k B T nm − 2 ( ref . 22 ) . The average applied force calcu - lated using equation ( 1 ) and the derived energy ( Fig . 5d ) are probably lower limit estimates . If we instead use the peak force estimated from the point - mass model ( Extended Data Fig . 3 , Methods ) , we would conclude that the PIEZO1 stiffness constant ( K ) would be about 32 . 5 pN nm − 1 ( or about 7 . 9 k B T nm − 2 ) , that the work to bring about the conformational change from curved to flat would be about 625 pN nm ( about 150 k B T ) , and that the tension associated with half - activation would be γ ≅ 1 . 9 k B T nm − 2 . There is uncertainty in the precise quantifi - cation of the force in HS - AFM , and for a number of reasons—including lipid compositional differences and possible interactions between the membrane and mica—we do not expect the supported bilayer to be a perfect replica of a cell membrane . Nevertheless , the calculated range of tension sensitivity determined by HS - AFM is consistent with val - ues that have previously been measured in electrophysiology experi - ments 21 , 22 . We conclude that PIEZO1 can undergo a reversible , flattening defor - mation when force is applied . The HS - AFM experiments apply force in a direction that is normal to the membrane surface . If tethers can attach to the channel in a cellular setting , then similarly directed forces could gate PIEZO1 . If lateral membrane tension is the primary gating stimulus , then equation ( 5 ) and equation ( 6 ) present a way to think about the energetic equivalence to a normal force , such as that applied by the HS - AFM tip .

The experiments were not randomized and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment . Proteoliposome reconstitution . Full - length mouse PIEZO1 protein was expressed in HEK293S GnTI − cells and purified in C12E10 as previously described 16 . For cryo - electron microscopy , lipid mixture of POPC , DOPS ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) and cholesterol at a 8 : 1 : 1 ( w : w : w ) ratio was used for proteoliposome reconstitution . For HS - AFM measurement , the lipid composition was POPE and POPG ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) at a 85 : 15 ( w : w ) ratio . Lipids were prepared with 1 . 3 % C12E10 as previously described 16 . Purified protein was incubated with the lipid / detergent mixture at a protein - to - lipid ratio of 1 : 20 ( w : w ) for 2 h at 4 °C . SM - 2 bio - beads ( Bio - Rad ) were then added to the mixture for incubation over - night to remove C12E10 . Electron microscopy sample preparation and imaging . Freshly reconstituted PIEZO1 in POPC : DOPS : cholesterol was supplemented with 3 mM fluorinated fos - choline - 8 ( FFC - 8 ) and frozen on glow - discharged Quantifoil 400 mesh gold R1 . 2 / 1 . 3 holey carbon grids as previously described 16 . Micrographs were recorded on a Talos Arctica transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) operating at 200 keV equipped with a K2 Summit direct electron detector ( Gatan ) controlled by SerialEM 43 . Super - resolution mode was used with nominal defocus range of 0 . 8 to 2 . 4 μ m and a calibrated physical pixel size of 1 . 9 Å . The exposure time for each image was 10 s fractionated over 50 frames , with a dose rate of 15 electrons per physical pixel per second . A total of 1 , 373 images was combined from 2 data collection sessions . Electron microscopy image processing . MotionCor2 was used for whole - frame motion correction with gain reference applied and dose weighting 44 . CTFFIND4 was used to estimate the contrast transfer function parameters for the summed images 45 . Using RELION 46 , 47 , 477 particles of top and bottom views were manually picked and extracted with a box size of 200 pixels . Two - dimensional classification in RELION generated the averaged images of top views ( 322 particles ) and bottom views ( 120 particles ) of PIEZO1 with a mask size of 250 Å to minimize the inter - ference from the peripheral membrane density . One thousand , one hundred and sixty - six particles of side views were manu - ally picked and grouped on the basis of the radii of their residing vesicles , with a bin width of 1 nm ( except for the 13 - nm and 31 - nm groups with the bin width of 3 nm ) . Two - dimensional averaging was performed in RELION on 19 parti - cles from the 13 - nm , 27 - nm and 31 - nm groups , and 25 particles from 15 - nm , 17 - nm , 19 - nm , 21 - nm , 23 - nm and 25 - nm groups . The box size was 320 pixels and the mask size was 400 Å . Two - dimensional averaging was also performed on the exact opposite side to the channels of the same vesicles , following the same procedure . Control vesicles with no channels were also binned with the width of 1 nm . Two - dimensional averages were performed on 21 to 25 particles from each group ( except for the 13 - nm group , which contained only 12 particles ) . MATLAB R2018a ( MathWorks ) was used to measure the radii of curvature on all 2D - averaged images of vesicles , with embedded PIEZO1 ( Extended Data Fig . 2a ) —which share the same vesicle size—first being extracted by edge detection ( Extended Data Fig . 2b ) . Using a polygon to select the PIEZO1 position ( Extended Data Fig . 2c ) , the inner and outer membrane boundaries on the PIEZO1 side were identified as segmented lines ( Extended Data Fig . 2d ) ; the cyan – green and green – yellow – blue contours represent the inner and outer membrane boundaries , respectively . The x and y coordinates of the edges that correspond to the outer and inner boundaries of the vesicle membrane were fitted as concentric circles using nonlinear least - squares solver ( Extended Data Fig . 2e , f ) . Ninety - five per cent confidence intervals of the fitted radii were calculated on the basis of the Jacobian of the fitted values with respect to the coefficients . The circle fits to the data on both boundaries give the local R c on the PIEZO1 side that is tangent to the centre of the PIEZO1 channel ( Extended Data Fig . 2g , h ) . For midplane radii , the error bars were calculated as the geometric mean of the error bars of inner and outer radii . HS - AFM . All HS - AFM movies in this study were taken by amplitude - modulation - mode HS - AFM ( RIBM ) , using optimized scanning and feedback parameters . Short cantilevers ( NanoWorld ) with spring constant of 0 . 15 N / m , resonance fre - quency of about 600 kHz and a quality factor of about 1 . 5 in buffer were used . A total of 2 μ l of the PIEZO1 reconstituted vesicles ( POPE : POPG 85 : 15 , ( w : w ) ) were deposited on 1 . 5 - mm diameter freshly cleaved mica , gently rinsed with imaging buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl ) after 5 min of incubation , and then mounted in the HS - AFM fluid cell . Both the A set and A free ( approxi - mately 1 . 5 nm ) of the cantilever oscillation were simultaneously recorded during HS - AFM force - sweep measurements 35 . The displacement of the sample ( Δ z ) was linearly drift - corrected by the positions of z - piezo attenuator ( and also corrected for the reduction in cantilever - oscillation amplitude ) before and after force - sweep experiment . The HS - AFM movies were drift - corrected and contrast - adjusted by a laboratory build image analysis software in ImageJ . The 360 - fold average and the analysis of dimensional changes of PIEZO1 particles were performed using ImageJ . The cross - correlation analysis of PIEZO1 channels was performed using MATLAB R2018a . Estimations of F HS - AFM during force - sweep measurements . In the main text , we used equation ( 1 ) to estimate ⟨ ⟩ − F HS AFM . To evaluate the validity of this approach , we undertook a thorough analysis of how the tip and the sample interact during HS - AFM operation . We monitored the real tip motion ( z ( t ) ) to reconstruct force trajectories of F HS - AFM applied when imaging objects in amplitude - modulated atomic force microscopy . In amplitude - modulated atomic force microscopy , the motion of the micro - cantilever – tip system can be described using the point - mass model 40 ¨ ω = − − + + (cid:31) mz t kz t m Q z t F t F d ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( 7 ) 0 dr ts in which m is the effective cantilever mass , z ( t ) is absolute tip motion , k is the cantilever stiffness , F dr is the drive force , F ts is the tip – sample interaction force that depends on the instantaneous gap ( d ) between the tip and the sample , and ω 0 and Q are the angular resonant frequency and quality factor , respectively . Equation ( 7 ) describes the total force that governs the tip motion , and includes the elastic response of the cantilever ( the 1st term ) , the hydrodynamic damping with the medium ( the 2nd term ) , the periodic driving force ( the 3rd term ) and the tip – sample interaction force ( the 4th term ) . Rearranging equation ( 7 ) , we can obtain equation ( 8 ) , which illustrates that the sum of the driving force and tip – sample interaction force can be estimated by a detailed analysis of the tip motion ( Extended Data Fig . 3a , b ) ¨ ω + = + + (cid:31) F t F d kz t m Q z t mz t ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( 8 ) dr ts 0 Thus , our force reconstruction steps included ( 1 ) calculate the forces caused by the elastic response of the cantilever and the hydrodynamic damping with the medium , and total force that governs the tip motion ( Extended Data Fig . 3c , d ) ; ( 2 ) sum up the above three forces , which equals F dr ( t ) + F ts ( d ) ( Extended Data Fig . 3e , f ) ; ( 3 ) in the out - of - contact condition ( A ratio = A set / A free = 1 ) , F ts is 0 ( we do not detect attractive forces in our HS - AFM tip oscillations ) , and thus only F dr ( t ) remains when the tip oscillates freely ( dashed line in Extended Data Fig . 2e , f ) ; and ( 4 ) F dr ( t ) is always constant , whereas the A ratio is changed to apply different forces . Therefore , the F ts ( Extended Data Fig . 3g , h ) can be derived by calculating the difference between F dr ( t ) + F ts ( d ) ( A ratio < 1 ) and F dr ( t ) ( A ratio = 1 ) . These reconstructed force trajectories ( Extended Data Fig . 3g , h ) of F ts per oscillation period are equivalent to the F HS - AFM applied to the imaging objects . To experimentally determine F ts , we measured the cantilever deflections during oscillation cycles at different A ratio on mica ( Extended Data Fig . 3a ) and membrane ( Extended Data Fig . 3b ) , respectively ( traces from black to grey with decreasing A ratio ) . The reduction of the tip - oscillation amplitude is caused by the tip – sample repulsive forces when the tip physically contacts the sample . Following the force reconstruction steps described above , we constructed the trajectories of F ts at differ - ent A ratio on mica ( Extended Data Fig . 3g ) and membrane ( Extended Data Fig . 3h ) . The peak force always occurs during the first part of the F ts force - reconstruction trajectory , and is caused by the initial tip – sample clash . Two characteristic forces—the peak force of F ts ( Extended Data Fig . 3i ) and the average force per cycle ⟨ ⟩ F ( ) ts ( Extended Data Fig . 3j ) at different A ratio —were extracted . The peak force applied by the tip to the stiff mica and the soft membrane are very similar ; only when A ratio < 0 . 65 does the peak force grow higher on mica ( compare the blue and red dashed lines in Extended Data Fig . 3i ) . We compared these experimental measurements of the peak forces with the web - based atomic force microscopy simulation tool VEDA ( https : / / nanohub . org / resources / veda ) 38 to estimate the peak force on samples with different stiffness . This simulation tool solves the point - mass model differential equation numerically , and applies differ - ent contact models . We used the Hertz contact model and similar parameters as in our experiments . The resulting peak - force values ( black and grey dashed lines , and grey shadowed area , in Extended Data Fig . 3i ) compare very well with the data we measured on the membrane . The ⟨ ⟩ F ts increases more linearly with decreasing A ratio on mica ( blue dashed line in Extended Data Fig . 3j ) , whereas the dependence of ⟨ ⟩ F ts with A ratio on the membrane increases in a somewhat fluctuating manner , and seems to reach a plateau at an A ratio < 0 . 7 ( red dashed line in Extended Data Fig . 3h ) . Finally , the ⟨ ⟩ F ts calculated by equation ( 1 ) ( black dashed line in Extended Data Fig . 3j ) shows a similar trend and estimates ⟨ ⟩ F ts of the same order as the ⟨ ⟩ F ts measurement on the membrane . Thus , the use of equation ( 1 ) to estimate the ⟨ ⟩ F ts is a valid approach in our HS - AFM setup . We further evaluated the influence of A free on the peak force during HS - AFM imaging on membrane ( Extended Data Fig . 3k ) . A higher A free produces a larger peak force at the same A ratio . In the condition of the HS - AFM force - sweep meas - urements ( A free = 1 . 5 nm ) , the peak force reaches about 200 pN at A ratio = 0 . 5 , Article reSeArcH which is roughly three times higher than the average force ⟨ ⟩ F ts calculated by equation ( 1 ) ( about 65 pN ) . Generation of topographies from PDB files . A plugin was written for IgorPro7 ( WaveMetrics ) , in which a cone - shaped tip with a hard - sphere of user - defined radius is scanned point - by - point ( x , y ) over the surface of a PDB structure . The sphere is lowered to the lowest position ( z ) it can occupy without clashing with any of the atoms of the PDB file . No mechanical properties of the tip or protein , or of protein hydration layers , are considered . The algorithm simply generates sphere - convoluted surface representations of PDB files at zero - force . Reporting summary .

This fitting allows us to estimate the upper bound of force ( peak force ) applied to PIEZO1 channels at any given A ratio .

Along the diagonal direction of the cross - correlation density maps , the molecules separate into two peaks . This suggests the existence of two subtypes of PIEZO1 with different sizes in HS - AFM force - sweep movies . Therefore , we assigned the molecules in the peaks as type - 1 ( about 70 % , white dashed circle ) and type - 2 ( about 30 % , yellow dashed circle ) PIEZO1 , respectively . The same molecules populate in the same subtype according to all analysed criteria . The total number of analysed PIEZO1 particles is 143 , from 11 HS - AFM movies acquired on ≥ 5 different samples , days and HS - AFM tips .

Article reSeArcH Extended Data Fig . 6 | PIEZO1 has an exceptional low 2D density of transmembrane helices . Transmembrane - helix 2D - density analysis for channels and transporters of known 3D structure . The transmembrane - helix density is estimated by the total number of transmembrane helices divided by the occupied membrane area of each known structure . A total of 201 channels and transporters structures have been analysed . A general trend seems to be that the channels are somewhat less densely packed than transporters , which is possibly a signature of the existence of a protein - free pore region . The PIEZO1 structure is an outlier : it is of exceptional size and has an exceptionally low density of transmembrane helices , ( less than 0 . 2 of a helix per square nanometre . This unique feature might be a signature , and prerequisite for PIEZO1 mechanosensing . 1 n a t u r e r e s e a r c h | r e p o r t i n g s u mm a r y A p r il 2018 Corresponding author ( s ) : Simon Scheuring Reporting Summary Nature Research wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish .

A description of all covariates tested A description of any assumptions or corrections , such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons A full description of the statistics including central tendency ( e . g . means ) or other basic estimates ( e . g . regression coefficient ) AND variation ( e . g . standard deviation ) or associated estimates of uncertainty ( e . g . confidence intervals ) For null hypothesis testing , the test statistic ( e . g . F , t , r ) with confidence intervals , effect sizes , degrees of freedom and P value noted Give P values as exact values whenever suitable . For Bayesian analysis , information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings For hierarchical and complex designs , identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes Estimates of effect sizes ( e . g . Cohen ' s d , Pearson ' s r ) , indicating how they were calculated Clearly defined error bars State explicitly what error bars represent ( e . g . SD , SE , CI ) Our web collection on statistics for biologists may be useful .

Sample size No statistical methods were applied to pre - determine sample sizes . The actual sample size of top - view and bottom - view cryo - EM average images was increased until the finally achieved resolution and quality compatible to the Piezo1 structural model ( PDB 6B3R ) . The actual sample size of side - view cryo - EM average images was increased until the membrane edge contrast ( at least S / N > 10 ) meet the expectation for local curvature analysis . The actual sample size of HS - AFM images was increased until the total number of analyzed Piezo1 particles ( reported as Type1 Piezo1 ) reaches 100 . Data exclusions No data were excluded from the analysis . During cryo - EM data averaging , good top - view , bottom - view , and side - view images were chosen for further image averaging based on their projected orientation . Replication Biochemical experiments , including protein purification and reconstitution , were successfully done in biological replicates for more than 10 times . HS - AFM experiments were successfully performed in replicates for more than 10 times on different samples , days and HS - AFM tips . Randomization This study did not allocate experimental groups thus no randomization was required for the reported experiments Blinding Blinding was not required for the reported experiments , because all data were analyzed using the same methods .
