SARS - CoV - 2 infected over 50 million Americans between January 2020 and mid - December 2021 , and has disproportionately impacted marginalized communities . 1 – 7 Throughout the major - ity of the pandemic , adults have experienced the brunt of infections . However , recent data indicate that SARS - CoV - 2 infections are starting to trend younger . 8 As of late September 2021 , children have contributed to 16 . 2 % of all positive cases in the United States , compared to just 2 . 7 % in April 2020 . 9 Based on current data , this is due in part to vaccination availability , reintroduction of in - person learning , and a variety of other social factors . 10 – 15 Although children can present with similar symptoms of COVID - 19 as adults ( fever , cough , shortness of breath , fatigue , diarrhea , and rhinorrhea ) , pediatric patients are Catherine T .

With COVID - 19 positioned to remain a threat to children , this study examines effectiveness of preoperative COVID - 19 symptom screening in pediatric patients . Methods : This retrospective cohort study included hospital billing / medical record queries of ( 1 ) procedures performed under conscious sedation / general anes - thesia and ( 2 ) laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 ( + ) cases from April 6 , 2020 , to June 15 , 2020 . Descriptive analyses were performed for demographic , procedural , symptom , and COVID - 19 test result data obtained from medical records . Bivariate analyses examined associations between SARS - CoV - 2 test results and symptom , demographic , and procedural data . Results : Among 2900 surgical cases , median ( interquartile range ) age was 8 . 1 ( 12 . 8 ) years . The majority were male ( n = 1609 , 55 . 5 % ) , white ( n = 1614 , 55 . 7 % ) , and not Hispanic / Latino ( n = 1658 , 57 . 2 % ) . Additionally , 85 . 4 % ( n = 2412 ) of cases were non - emergent . Fifteen COVID - 19 ( + ) cases were identified , for a 0 . 5 % positivity rate . COVID - 19 positivity was not associated with sex , American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status , or preoperative symptom status . Notably , 92 . 9 % ( n = 13 ) of COVID - 19 ( + ) cases were asymptomatic . COVID - 19 ( + ) patients were significantly older ( 15 . 6 years ) than COVID - 19 ( − ) patients ( 8 . 0 years ) . Patients who were not white , were Hispanic / Latino , or had a relatively lower economic status , were more likely to test positive . Conclusions : Preoperative symptom screenings insufficiently identified COVID - 19 ( + ) patients . During outbreaks , testing protocols should be implemented to identify COVID - 19 ( + ) patients . Future research should examine if observations are similar for other variants , and how health disparities associate with COVID - 19 .

It is critical that we become educated on how to exist with COVID - 19 in healthcare , and deter - mine the most effective ways of screening for the virus in children . To date , there have been few studies examining this smaller segment of the COVID - 19 population . One recent letter reported that COVID - 19 ( + ) pediatric surgi - cal patients were largely older , and symptomatic , but that those who tested positive did not vary by race , or Hispanic ethnicity . 30 However , this study was limited to a small sam - ple size and short time period . The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative COVID - 19 symptom screening relative to SARS - CoV - 2 testing in pediatric patients , using a larger sample size and broader time period than the earlier report . Using these data , we aim to propose an evidence - based approach to preoperative COVID - 19 screening for children . Our secondary goal is to explore patient charac - teristics and demographics which may associate with posi - tivity rates within the preoperative pediatric population . METHODS After receiving institutional review board approval with a waiver of informed consent , we performed a ret - rospective review examining COVID - 19 symptoms and SARS - CoV - 2 test results in preoperative patients at a single pediatric tertiary care medical center . Demographics , clin - ical presentation , operative procedures , and SARS - CoV - 2 test results were all obtained from the medical record . All data were stored and managed in password protected documents within our institution’s security firewall . Nearly all SARS - CoV - 2 testing was performed using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) methodology at our institutional core laboratory , and only a small number of tests were per - formed at an outside institution before patient transfer to our hospital . Patient Eligibility and Case Selection Two distinct hospital billing and medical record que - ries were performed to identify eligible patients ( Fig . 1 ) . During the study period , preoperative SARS - CoV - 2 testing and COVID - 19 symptom screening were both required by our institution for all non - emergent proce - dures performed under general anesthesia or conscious sedation . The first query identified all patients undergo - ing procedures under general anesthesia or conscious sedation at our institution from April 6 , 2020 , through June 15 , 2020 . This list was then screened to identify laboratory confirmed COVID - 19 ( + ) cases and COVID - 19 ( − ) cases . Patients whose results were unavailable were excluded from all analyses . Upon report of a preoperative positive SARS - CoV - 2 test , non - emergent procedures were rescheduled . As the above query only captured completed procedures , rescheduling a procedure due to a posi - tive SARS - CoV - 2 test result would exclude it from query results . Thus , to avoid selection bias towards COVID - 19 ( − ) cases , and to ensure all COVID - 19 ( + ) cases reported during preoperative screening were captured , a second query was performed . In the second query , laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 ( + ) cases at our institution were identified using the asso - ciated International Classification of Diseases , Tenth Revision ( ICD - 10 ) , code U07 . 1 during the same time period . This list was screened for patients who were COVID - 19 ( + ) as a result of preoperative testing , and who did not overlap with the previous procedure query . Patients who tested positive during a clinical or emergency department visit unrelated to an upcoming surgical procedure were excluded from our final sample of COVID - 19 ( + ) cases . To achieve our final cohort , the total number of COVID - 19 ( + ) cases included a combination of both que - ries , whereas the total number of COVID - 19 ( − ) cases were identified during the initial procedure query . Statistical Analyses Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Version 27 ( IBM Corp . , Armonk , N . Y . ) . Frequency distributions were reported for demographics ; COVID - 19 clinical presenta - tion ; procedural data ; and test source , type , and results . Unless otherwise stated , variables were dichotomized as follows : race ( white versus non - white ) , ethnicity ( Hispanic or Latino versus not Hispanic or Latino ) and COVID - 19 symptom status ( at least one COVID - 19 symptom versus asymptomatic ) . The Mann – Whitney U test was used to compare the difference in median age between COVID - 19 ( + ) and COVID - 19 ( − ) groups . The Fisher exact and Pearson chi - squared tests were used to assess associations of sex , race , ethnicity , American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status , and COVID - 19 symptom status with SARS - CoV - 2 test results , as appropriate . An independent samples t - test was used to evaluate differences in median Takeaways Question : Do preoperative symptom screenings accu - rately identify incidental COVID - 19 cases among pediatric patients undergoing surgery ? Findings : COVID - 19 positivity was 0 . 5 % among the 2900 total procedures included in our retrospective cohort series . The presence of any COVID - 19 symptom was not significantly associated with a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test result , and approximately 93 % of COVID - 19 ( + ) cases were asymptomatic . Meaning : Preoperative screening based on symptoms was insufficient in identifying COVID - 19 ( + ) cases in our sam - ple , highlighting the importance of preoperative SARS - CoV - 2 testing in pediatric surgical patients .

Median household income data were obtained from the US Census Bureau using patient zipcode . 31 Cases with missing data were excluded from analyses . A P value less than 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . ( See appendix , Supplemental Digital Content 1 , which displays the STROBE statement , http : / / links . lww . com / PRSGO / C76 . ) RESULTS Cohort Demographics A total of 2900 cases were obtained from both queries . The procedure query resulted in 2953 cases , of which 2885 were COVID - 19 ( − ) , 13 were COVID - 19 ( + ) , and 55 were excluded due to absent testing data . The COVID - 19 ( + ) case query resulted in 197 cases , of which two additional cases were identified during preoperative screening , and did not overlap with the original query . In total , these que - ries yielded 15 COVID - 19 ( + ) cases and 2885 COVID - 19 ( − ) cases , with a resulting positivity rate of 0 . 5 % ( Table 1 ) . Of note , 99 . 4 % ( n = 2882 ) of test results were obtained using PCR testing , all performed at our institution . All remaining test results ( n = 18 ) were obtained from out - side medical records following patient transfer to our institution . The median age of the entire cohort was 8 . 1 years [ minimum : < 1 . 2 months ; maximum : 59 . 8 years ; interquar - tile range ( IQR ) : 12 . 8 years ; 5th percentile : 3 . 5 months , 95th percentile : 21 . 2 years ] , and the majority of the sample was male ( n = 1609 , 55 . 5 % ) , white ( n = 1614 , 55 . 7 % ) , and not Hispanic or Latino ( n = 1658 , 57 . 2 % ) . Approximately 85 % of all cases were non - emergent ( n = 2412 ) , with the greatest number of cases ( n = 1203 , 42 . 6 % ) classified as ASA 2 . Orthopedics was the most common surgical service ( n = 522 , 18 . 0 % ) . Symptoms and Cohort Demographics There was no significant difference in presence of symptoms between COVID - 19 ( + ) and COVID - 19 ( − ) cases ( P > 0 . 99 ; Table 2 ) . Roughly 93 % ( n = 13 ; symptom data unavailable for one case ) of COVID - 19 ( + ) cases were asymptomatic . The only presenting symptom in COVID - 19 ( + ) cases was dermatologic ( cellulitis ) , occurring in one case ( 7 . 1 % ) , while fever was the most common present - ing symptom in COVID - 19 ( − ) cases ( n = 72 , 2 . 5 % ) . Additionally , sex and ASA physical status distribution did not significantly vary between COVID - 19 ( + ) and COVID - 19 ( − ) cases ( P > 0 . 05 , both ; Table 3 ) . COVID - 19 ( + ) patients were significantly older ( median age : 15 . 6 years , minimum : 6 months , maximum : 25 . 4 years , IQR : 7 . 0 years ) than COVID - 19 ( − ) patients ( median age : 8 . 0 years , minimum : < 1 . 2 months , maxi - mum : 59 . 8 years , IQR : 12 . 8 years ) ( P = 0 . 04 ) . Furthermore , patients who were non - white had 6 . 7 times the odds of test - ing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 compared to white patients [ OR : 6 . 66 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 2 . 04 – 21 . 71 , P = 0 . 001 ] . Additionally , patients who were Hispanic or Latino had 4 . 5 times the odds of testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 compared to non - Hispanic or Latino patients ( OR : 4 . 45 , 95 % CI : 1 . 40 – 14 . 12 , P = 0 . 006 ) .

PRS Global Open • 2022 4 ( + ) patients lived in regions with significantly lower median household incomes ( mean income = $ 73 , 761 . 07 ± $ 32 , 388 . 63 ) compared to COVID - 19 ( − ) patients ( mean income = $ 93 , 781 . 18 ± $ 36 , 540 . 20 ; P = 0 . 03 ) . Of note , median household income data were unavailable for 43 patients . Additional review of COVID - 19 ( + ) cases showed that one patient tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 before two separate surgical procedures , contributing two COVID - 19 ( + ) cases . As a result , six patients ( n = 7 / 15 cases , 46 . 7 % ) had comorbidities before surgery , the most com - mon being obesity ( n = 4 / 7 cases , 57 . 1 % ) . Postoperative complications data were available for 40 . 0 % ( n = 6 / 15 ) of COVID - 19 ( + ) patients , with none experiencing surgical complications . There were no unexpected readmissions or reoperations . One patient with COVID - 19 died on post - operative day zero ; however , the cause of death was attrib - uted to sepsis , pneumonia , and intestinal obstruction within the setting of chronic lung disease and COVID - 19 . DISCUSSION The COVID - 19 pandemic has presented one of the greatest healthcare challenges in modern history . A lack of knowledge in the early stages resulted in a catastrophic loss of life , suspension of elective surgical and medical care , and questions regarding the long - term impact on healthcare . Thus , it is essential that we continue to expand our knowledge based on the past two years of experience to facilitate decision - making going forward . In our study , we explored the effectiveness of preoperative COVID - 19 screening protocols ( routine testing and symptom screen - ing ) to provide supportive data for an evidence - based approach for preoperative COVID - 19 screening in the pediatric population . We also investigated how patient demographics associated with preoperative COVID - 19 status . Although our study sample was not limited to plas - tic surgery cases alone , plastic surgeons often perform surgeries in conjunction with other specialties . Thus , a diverse sample of surgical specialties provides added rel - evance and generalizability to our study . The COVID - 19 positivity rate in our cohort was 0 . 5 % , similar to other pediatric studies . 3 , 30 , 32 – 35 It has been sug - gested that lower positivity rates in children are in part a result of less frequent testing , as a consequence of asymp - tomatic presentation . 22 However , in the present study , all non - emergent cases ( approximately 85 % of the entire cohort ) were tested preoperatively for SARS - CoV - 2 , regard - less of symptom status . This suggests additional causes for lower positivity rates among children , such as inherent or behavioral protection against infection . From a biological Table 1 .

McNamara et al . • COVID - 19 Screening Effectiveness 5 standpoint , differential ACE2 receptor expression , fewer risk factors , and differences in innate and adaptive immu - nity have been postulated as potential justifications for low pediatric infection rates . 13 , 36 , 37 On the social - behavioral level , others have suggested lack of travel , school closures , and fewer activities outside the home as possible expla - nations . 11 , 13 Of note , the majority of data from this study , similar to other pediatric surgical studies , were collected in the latter part of the 2019 – 2020 academic year and into the early summer ( March – July ) . In the regions where data were collected for the present ( Massachusetts ) and previ - ous studies ( Texas , Pennsylvania , and Washington ) , state mandated school closures were instituted during these periods , preventing in - person learning and after - school activities . 3 , 30 , 38 Lower morbidity and mortality figures have con - tributed to the misconception that children are not sig - nificantly impacted by COVID - 19 , especially early in the pandemic . 7 , 16 Review of COVID - 19 ( + ) surgical cases in our study similarly revealed only one death , and no post - operative complications , or unexpected readmissions or reoperations , analogous to another pediatric study . 39 More recently , however , there was a 10 - fold increase in weekly hospitalizations due to COVID - 19 from June 2021 to August 2021 in children 0 – 4 years of age , which coin - cided with emergence of the Delta variant . 40 These data emphasize the previously overlooked vulnerability of chil - dren to this virus , and highlight an immediate need to establish COVID - 19 testing protocols for children in the operative setting . In an effort to control COVID - 19 transmission in the operative setting , including patient to patient , and patient to provider , it is of primary importance to iden - tify COVID - 19 ( + ) patients . Standard screening questions for COVID - 19 - related symptoms have become ubiqui - tous . However , the effectiveness of this symptom - based approach remains unclear in the pediatric preoperative setting . Our study found no significant difference in the presence of symptoms by SARS - CoV - 2 test status . These data contrast a previous letter which showed that pre - operative COVID - 19 ( + ) pediatric patients were more likely to be symptomatic . 30 The difference may reflect a larger sample size or longer study period relative to the mentioned study . In addition , approximately 93 % of COVID - 19 ( + ) cases in our cohort were asymptomatic , considerably higher than several other pediatric studies in which testing was conducted primarily due to expo - sure and / or presence of symptoms ( asymptomatic range : 14 . 2 % – 28 % ) , rather than routine screening . 18 , 22 – 24 This difference may be due to the underlying reason for test - ing in associating symptoms to positivity rates . Our data suggest that rigorous preoperative testing rather than Table 3 .

PRS Global Open • 2022 6 screening questions is essential to identify COVID - 19 pos - itive children preoperatively . In emergent instances when patients cannot be tested preoperatively , we suggest they be treated as COVID - 19 ( + ) ( even when asymptomatic ) , and established precautions should be exercised . We also found that patients in our study who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 were significantly older than those who tested negative ( median 15 . 6 versus 8 . 0 years ) , mir - roring a prior study . 30 The behavioral independence and increased social interaction in older children may account for this finding . However , with the lifting of school closure mandates for the 2021 – 2022 academic year , schools have largely returned to in - person learning and after - school activities despite transmission of the Delta variant , and appearance of the Omicron variant . 41 , 42 As a result , the above age difference is likely to be diminished with this return over time . With the opening of schools , emergence of the Omicron variant , and younger students only now becoming eligible for vaccination , a reliance on behavioral protections ( mask - ing , handwashing , and social distancing ) , is still critical to preventing infection . 14 , 15 However , even in parts of the country with school mask mandates , there have still been outbreaks among children . 12 Given the published effective - ness of masks when donned correctly , these outbreaks sug - gest that difficulty in managing protective behavioral habits ( such as consistent masking ) is , and will likely continue to be , a strong contributor to rising infections in children . 43 Although it is important to acknowledge that interactions at school and during school - related activities are not neces - sarily the only sources of pediatric transmission , a recent study showed that there were significantly greater increases in pediatric SARS - CoV - 2 infections in areas of the United States without school mask mandates , relative to those with them . 10 This further supports the importance of masking and other behavioral mitigation strategies . Racial , socioeconomic , and other demographic dis - parities have been well - documented throughout the pandemic . 2 , 3 , 6 , 44 , 45 We found that children from racially marginalized families had 570 % increased odds of test - ing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 relative to white patients . A similar trend was seen for children who were Hispanic or Latino ( 350 % increase ) , compared to those who were not . These findings align with those of previous adult and pedi - atric series , but contrast a recent letter . 3 , 6 , 30 , 44 , 46 Although a comprehensive analysis of the determinants underlying these trends is beyond the scope of this study , there are several potential contributing factors to be noted . Those who are racially / ethnically marginalized often live in mul - tigenerational homes and crowded areas that do not lend to efficient social distancing , propagating viral spread . 5 Additionally , inequities related to access to healthcare pre - dispose racially / ethnically marginalized families to under - lying conditions ( asthma , diabetes , etc . ) , which are all risk factors for severe COVID - 19 . 47 – 50 Median household income analyses produced equally interesting results . Analogous to other pediat - ric and adult data publications , we found that patients testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 resided in areas with sig - nificantly lower median household incomes relative to patients testing negative . 44 , 45 Similar to trends seen for racially / ethnically marginalized individuals , barriers such as the ability to access insurance , quality educa - tion and healthcare , and adequate diets for low - income families may result in increased risks for underlying conditions and COVID - 19 . 47 , 50 – 53 These data , in combina - tion with the observed racial / ethnic disparities , further highlight the need to address underlying social determi - nants of health both within and outside of the context of COVID - 19 . Limitations of our study should be acknowledged . This study was performed at a single , tertiary pediatric care facility in the Northeastern United States , and thus results may not be generalizable to other institutions . Additionally , conclusions could change based on the cir - culating variant . The study was conducted over a relatively short period , with a small COVID - 19 ( + ) sample on which to base conclusions . Furthermore , approximately 25 % and 33 % of patients did not report their race and ethnic - ity , respectively . Thus , analyses using these data may be over - or underestimated . The hospital query used to identify COVID - 19 ( + ) cases relied on the correct ICD - 10 coding . COVID - 19 ( + ) cases incorrectly defined by a code other than U07 . 1 would not have been captured in our query . Similarly , symptoms were determined based on documentation in the medi - cal record . Incomplete documentation of symptoms could also have underestimated overall COVID - 19 symptoms in our pediatric cohort . Moreover , it is important to acknowledge that our insti - tution’s preoperative SARS - CoV - 2 testing requirement , irrespective of symptom status , may have biased this study toward asymptomatic patients . It is possible that symptom - atic patients scheduled for non - emergent procedures may have elected to cancel their surgery without undergoing testing . As a result , the relative percentage of asymptom - atic to symptomatic patients may be overestimated . CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Accurate and universal preoperative testing is essential to identify pediatric patients infected with SARS - CoV - 2 before surgery . Furthermore , screening practices reliant on symptoms alone are ineffective . In light of only newly expanded vaccination eligibility by age , and continued prevalence and emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants respectively , we strongly recommend that all nonemergent patients undergo preoperative SARS - CoV - 2 testing , regardless of symptom status . When COVID - 19 reaches an endemic stage , we would suggest testing only during local / regional surges . However , as we continue to navigate emerging variants / surges at present , preop - erative testing of all non - emergent pediatric patients is recommended . 54 In our sample , patients from racially / ethnically marginalized communities , and those of lower relative economic status were more likely to test positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . Additional investigation is necessary to address the underlying health determinants responsible for these inequities . McNamara et al . • COVID - 19 Screening Effectiveness 7 Brian I .
