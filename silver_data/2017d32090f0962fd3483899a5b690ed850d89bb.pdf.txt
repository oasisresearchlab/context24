By analyzing 24 , 167 human mt - genome samples , collected for ﬁve continents , we have developed a co - mutation network model to investigate characteristic human evolutionary patterns . The analysis highlighted richer co - mutating regions of the mt - genome , suggesting the presence of epistasis . Speciﬁcally , a large por - tion of COX genes was found to co - mutate in Asian and American populations , whereas , in African , European , and Oceanic populations , there was greater co - mutation bias in hypervariable regions . Interestingly , this study demonstrated hierarchical modularity as a crucial agent for these co - mutation networks . More profoundly , our ancestry - based co - mutation module analyses showed that mutations cluster preferentially in known mitochondrial haplogroups . Contemporary human mt - genome nucleotides most closely resembled the ancestral state , and very few of them were found to be ancestral - variants . Overall , these results demonstrated that subpopulation - based biases may Preprint submitted to XXX October 4 , 2019 favor mitochondrial gene speciﬁc epistasis .

Introduction Genetic polymorphism varies among a species as well as within genomes and carries important implications for the evolution and conservation of species . Polymorphism in the mitochondrial ( mt ) genome is routinely used to trace ancient human migration routes and to obtain absolute dates for genetic prehistory ( Chen , at al . , 1995 ) . The human mt - genome is very small ( 16 . 6 kb ) , maternally inherited , evolves in both neutral and adaptive fashions , and shows a great deal of variation as a result of divergent evolution . An absence of recombination within mt - genome provides distinct polymorphic loci which have been used to deﬁne human genealogy referred to as mt - genome haplogroups ( Chen , at al . , 1995 ) . These haplogroups are formed as a result of the sequential accumulation of mutations through maternal lineages . Since mitochondria are essential to cellular metabolism , mt - genome variation has been associated with multiple complex diseases including Alzheimer’s disease in haplogroup U ( Van , et al . , 2004 ) , idiopathic Parkinson disease within JT haplogroup ( Hudson , et al . , 2013 ) and age - related macular degeneration in the JTU haplogroup cluster ( Kenney , et al . , 2013 ) . Due to population migra - tion , distinct lineages of mt - genome are associated with major global groups ( African , American , European , Asian and Oceanic ) raising the possibility that mt - genome variation could contribute to the diﬀerences in disease prevalence observed among both ethnic and racial groups ( Mishmar , et al . , 2003 ; Shriner , and Keita . , 2016 ; Zanellati , et al . , 2015 ) . Conventionally , analyses of mt - genome evolution have focused on individ - ual mutations , particularly in describing haplogroups , and to understand and predict ancestral behavior . However , the evolutionary behavior of mt - genome often involves cooperative changes within and between genes which are diﬃ - 2 cult to detect using haplogroup analysis . For example , correlated mt - genome mutations were reported among diﬀerent oxidative phosphorylation subunits , which were found to aﬀect population speciﬁc human longevity ( Raule , et al . , 2014 ; Fan , et al . , 2016 ; Giuliani , et al . , 2018 ; Conte , et al . , 2018 ) . Besides , cooperative activities of both mitochondrial proteins and tRNA genes are critical for mt - genome evolution . The importance of co - mutational interac - tions has been well documented in the genomics ﬁeld ( Lane , et al . , 2012 ; Chen , et al . , 2013 ; Haddad , et al . , 2018 ) . Increasing evidence suggests that interactions among polymorphic sites may confer a cumulative association of multiple mutations with many diseases ( Chen , et al . , 2013 ) . Interactions among polymorphic sites have also eﬀectively been used to infer ancestry and functional convergence in the human populations ( Ioannidis , et al . , 2001 ) . Commonly used methods include tree ensembles , functional nodal mutations , and single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) based enrichment ( Lunetta , at al . , 2004 ) . Important information about mt - genome evolutionary behavior , which is contained in the correlated changes between nucleotide positions both within and between genes , is not captured by these techniques . Despite strong evidence that mt - genome variation plays a role in the development and progression of complex human diseases , mitochondrial genetic variation has been largely ignored in the context of co - mutations and particularly the mechanisms by which these co - mutations occur ( Boles , et al . , 1998 ; Goodman , et al . , 2006 ) . Investigation of co - mutation eﬀects can , therefore , improve the explanatory ability of genetics twofold . Firstly , the interaction between two informative genomic positions to explain a part of the trait heritability . Secondly , ﬁnding signiﬁcant statistical links between mutations could provide strong indications of molecular - level interactions that diﬀer between distant populations ( Hartwig , , 2013 ) . Complex network science revolves around the hypothesis that the behavior of complex systems can be elucidated in terms of structural and functional relationships between their constituents employing a graph representation 3 ( Albert , and Barab´asi . , 2002 ; Shinde , et al . , 2015 ; Shinde , and Jalan . , 2015 ; Whitwell , et al . , 2018 ; Rai , et al . , 2018 ; Ho , et al . , 2014 ) . The basis of the current study is that genome positions can impact each other and co - mutate within genomes ( Shinde , et al . , 2018 ; Du , et al . , 2008 ; Sun , et al . , 2014 ) . The interaction between two or more genetic loci is referred to here as the co - mutation of nucleotide positions . There are previous studies which have used genomic co - mutations as a basis of the evolution of human H3N2 and Ebola viruses ( Du , et al . , 2008 ; Deng , et al . , 2015 ) . These viral genome models have identiﬁed the co - mutating nucleotide clusters , apparently underpinning the dynamics of virus evolution since these clusters were antigenic regions of the viral capsid proteins ( Du , et al . , 2008 ; Deng , et al . , 2015 ) . In another study , Shinde et al . ( Shinde , et al . , 2018 ) demonstrated the impact of codon position bias while forming co - mutations using human mt - genomes . These studies have considered perfect co - mutation as causing factor for co - mutations . However , the role of the co - mutation frequency in these studies remains unclear . Here , we thoroughly examined a set of networks associated with a range of co - mutation frequencies and chose a particular co - mutation frequency for further network construction . Whilst pair - wise co - mutations can be straightforwardly perceived , the identiﬁcation of larger sized functional units is not straightforward . Here , we used community detection algorithms to enumerate lists of modules formed within networks and described the functional relationships among nucleotide positions forming these modules . We set out to develop a comprehensive approach to understand mitochon - drial diversity using mitochondrial co - mutations . To this end , we conducted a comparative analysis of 24 , 167 sequenced mt - genomes . The paper is orga - nized as follows . In the ﬁrst section , we brieﬂy described the level of diversity observed among underlying subpopulations concerning polymorphic site vari - ations in human mitochondrial genomes . In the second section , we described the framework to investigate co - mutations , which are critical in underlying complex mitochondrial evolution . For this , we constructed co - mutation net - 4 works which were used to identify modules of co - mutations and also compared these results with those of the corresponding random networks . In the third and fourth sections , we identiﬁed local topological phenomena , which were crucial agents for co - mutation networks make - up . We listed down modules comprised of co - mutations and demonstrated that the identiﬁed modules indeed correspond to ancestry based associations . Overall , revealing the importance of co - mutational biases among diﬀerent human subpopulations , our analysis identiﬁed local preferences , which were key agents in forming mt - genome epistatic interactions . 2 . Methods and Material 2 . 1 . Acquisition of genomic data Analysis of mt - genome variations in continental populations has revealed the most ancient of all human continent - speciﬁc haplogroups in Africa and their subsequent migration and settlement in other continents ( Chen , at al . , 1995 ) . Therefore , continents are constituents to deﬁning diﬀerent global - ancestral lineages beyond being just landmasses . The global lineages among each continent have been shown to explain a variety of signatures including demographic history , climate and environmental changes , local - admixture patterns ( Conte , et al . , 2018 ; Fonseca , et al . , 2008 ; Derenko , et al . , 2001 ; Hudson , et al . , 2013 ) . Each continent has its own signatures as well as shared signatures , as human migrations are known to happen diﬀerently among diﬀerent continents ( Mishmar , et al . , 2003 ) . Having this notion , we prepared an extensive collection of mitochondrial genomes of geographically diverse Homo sapiens populations ( Fig 1 ) from the Human Mitochondrial Database ( Hmtdb ) ( Rubino , et al . , 2012 ) . All downloaded genome sequences were in FASTA format . In total , the dataset comprised of 24 , 167 mitochondrial genome sequences from the ﬁve world continents ( genome groups ) , including 3426 African ( AF ) , 2650 American ( AM ) , 8483 Asian ( AS ) , 8060 European ( EU ) and 1548 Oceanic ( OC ) genomes . 5 Antarctica was excluded from the present analysis since no data was avail - able . It should be noted that these genome groups are multiethnic cohorts representing a range of populations across the continent ( Fig 1A ) . A brief description of all the genomes and their origin is provided in S1 File . 2 . 2 . Construction and preliminary analysis of co - mutation networks Co - mutation calculations were carried out on each genome group distinctly . Co - mutation network construction is broadly divided into two parts , con - struction of primary networks for each genome sequence followed by the construction of ﬁnal networks for each genome groups . Each primary co - mutation network represents an individual sequence , and thus for each genome group , M primary co - mutation networks were generated where M is the num - ber of sequences in the genome group . In a co - mutation network ( for both primary and ﬁnal ) , nodes represent genome positions , and edges between nodes represent genomic co - mutations . We constructed ﬁve co - mutation networks for each genome group using their primary co - mutation networks . Final co - mutation networks comprise of qualitative information of interactions between genome positions . The methodology for constructing primary and ﬁnal co - mutation networks is schematically represented in Fig 1 and described as follows : 2 . 2 . 1 . Primary co - mutation network ( 1 ) Genome sequence data was end to end aligned . ( 2 ) All non - variable genome positions within samples of a genome group were removed , leaving only polymorphic genome positions . The number of polymorphic sites ( N P ) is given in Table 2 . ( 3 ) Using only polymorphic nucleotide positions , we calculated the frequency of occurrence of all the nucleotide pairs f ( x i y j ) = N ( x i y j ) / M where , N ( x i y j ) denoted the number of co - mutation pairs ( x i y j ) at position ( i , j ) . We then calculated the frequency of occurrence of single nucleotides f ( x i ) = N ( x i ) / M and f ( y j ) = N ( y j ) / M where , N ( x i ) and N ( y j ) denoted the number of single nucleotides at their respective positions i and j ( Du , 6 Figure 1 : Schematic representation of mtDNA co - mutation network construc - tion and analysis . ( A ) World map shows sequence data taken for the current study covered a good distribution across the entire globe . ( B ) A schematic diagram is drawn for a genome group with 5 sample sequences . The schematic diagram depicts ( 1 ) Alignment of genomes . All mitochondrial genomes in a genome group were end to end aligned , and therefore all aligned sequences had the same length . ( 2 ) Removal of non - informative sites . A genome position consist of a single nucleotide among all samples was removed from the analysis . ( 3 ) Calculation of co - mutation frequency ( C F ) for each nucleotide pair . ( C ) Selection of network eﬃciency score ( α ) . α was a threshold when the average degree ( (cid:104) k (cid:105) ) of a network is small , and the size of the largest connected component ( N LCC ) is high . For each genome group , α was found to be diﬀerent . ( D ) Each genome group has M genomes i . e . M networks . A unique list of edges was picked up from M networks from a genome group to construct a ﬁnal weighted network for M networks in a genome group . Likewise , ﬁve networks were constructed for ﬁve genome groups . 7 et al . , 2008 ) . ( 4 ) Co - mutation of two nucleotides ( C F ) at position ( i , j ) was denoted as , C Fi , j = f ( x i y j ) 2 f ( x i ) f ( y j ) ( 1 ) For a particular co - mutation frequency threshold , here , termed as network eﬃciency score ( see Section 2 . 3 ) , we constructed primary co - mutation networks . A network can be represented mathematically by an adjacency matrix ( A ) with binary entries . A ij = { 1 if C Fi , j > = α 0 otherwise ( 2 ) As each genome sequence has its own information of co - mutating genome positions , a total M primary co - mutation networks were generated for each genome group . 2 . 2 . 2 . Final co - mutation network Unique edges from all primary co - mutation networks of a genome group were used to construct a ﬁnal co - mutation network ( Fig 1D ) . These ﬁve ﬁnal co - mutation networks were used for network analysis and community detection . We extracted hierarchical modules from ﬁnal co - mutation networks and compared these networks with random networks , hypothesizing that hierar - chical modularity is the underlying phenomena of co - mutation networks and is not a mere outcome of the random evolutionary process . Furthermore , we characterized the identiﬁed module structures using ancestral markers . 2 . 2 . 3 . Preliminary analysis of co - mutation networks The degree of a node ( k i ) is deﬁned as a number of edges connected to the node such as k i = (cid:80) Nj = 1 A ij where N denoted the number of nodes in a network . The average degree connectivity (cid:104) k (cid:105) is the average nearest neighbor degree of nodes with degree k . The clustering coeﬃcient ( C ) is a measure of the extent to which nodes in a network tend to cluster together . An 8 average clustering coeﬃcient of a network can be written as (cid:104) C (cid:105) = 1 N (cid:80) Ni = 1 C i . Another property of the network which turns out to be crucial in distinguishing the individual networks was the assortative coeﬃcient ( r ) , which measures the tendency of nodes with the similar numbers of edges to connect . The assortative coeﬃcient , r , was deﬁned as the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient of degree between pairs of linked nodes ( Newman , et al . , 2003 ) . The value of r being zero corresponds to a random network , whereas the negative ( positive ) values correspond to dis ( assortative ) networks . 2 . 3 . Selection of network eﬃciency score ( α ) Network eﬃciency score ( α ) was used to ﬁlter edges required for network construction . Selecting an α value for each network should require iterating through a range of C F values . To consider a network with C F values of least 10 − 4 precision would require the construction of 24 , 167 ∗ 10 4 networks in total , which would be a very computationally intensive process . Therefore , we performed statistical sampling on each genome group interdependently by selection analysis of m samples from each population . The sample size was determined by Cochran’s sample size formula ( Cochran , , 1997 ) with critical value ( z = 1 . 96 ) . As the population was ﬁnite , the sample size was corrected by Cochran’s adjustment ( Cochran , , 1997 ) . A zero α value would result in co - mutation between each mutation and all others , whereas α equal to one would give only those pairs of mutations which have co - mutated perfectly in a genome group . In other words , zero α value would result in the globally connected network ( Fig 2B ) and α = 1 would result networks with many globally connected small sub - graphs ( Fig 2E ) . Even when the α value was as high as 0 . 99 , networks remained very densely connected ( Fig 2C ) . Therefore , it was reasonable to propose a criterion to select an α value , otherwise generated networks would be saturated structures holding no information about co - mutations . In order to tackle this , we plotted (cid:104) k (cid:105) and the size of the largest connected component ( N LCC ) against all the α values . We observed surprising network phenomena where at a particular 9 α value , (cid:104) k (cid:105) is small whilst N LCC is large . At this point , networks are sparser as compared to previous α values ( Fig 2D ) . By a sparse network , we would mean that the majority of elements of the adjacency matrix are zeroes . After exceeding this α value , the network breaks into several disconnected components . With this criterion , we chose a particular α value for each genome group and constructed primary co - mutation networks . Although the α value applied to each genome group was very high ( close to 1 ) , this value was suﬃcient to capture more than 50 % of the polymorphic sites in each genome group ( except in AS ; S4 Table and S3 Fig ) . A similar criterion of ﬁltering network edges has been earlier used to construct gene co - expression network ( Jackson , et al . , 2018 ) . It should be noted that α values for each genome groups were diﬀerent ( Table 2 ) . 2 . 4 . Detection of module structures in co - mutation networks We used the Louvain algorithm , a modularity maximization algorithm , for community detection for our networks ( Blondel , et al . , 2008 ) . The Louvain method was a simple , eﬃcient , and easy - to - implement method for identifying communities in large networks . The python package of Louvain algorithm was used to enumerate module structures ( Blondel , et al . , 2008 ) , and Gephi software was used for visualization ( Bastian , et al . , 2009 ) . 3 . Results Analysis of polymorphic sites is provided in supplementary materials and summarised in Table 1 and Fig 3 . Codon position ( CP ) 2 showed fewer polymorphisms as compared to CP 1 and CP 3 . Genes ATP6 and ATP8 demonstrated a higher level of polymorphisms at all three CPs . Similarly , all three HVS regions have displayed a higher level of polymorphisms , whereas genes of rRNA and tRNA have shown lower levels of polymorphisms . 10 0 . 0 0 . 5 0 400 800 1200 1600 0 . 90 0

The observed polymorphisms in each of 13 protein - coding genes show mutational biases at codon positions . ATP genes contained the most polymorphisms . CP 2 showed fewer polymorphisms as compare to CP 1 and CP 3 . COX1 and ND4 had the lowest proportion of observed polymorphic sites , and ATP6 had the largest proportion . 3 . 1 . Evolution of mitochondrial co - mutations 3 . 1 . 1 . Co - mutations displaying intra - and inter - genomic loci biases Analysis of pairs of co - mutations provides insight into the relationship between two distinct genome locations . Co - mutations can be formulated within a particular mitochondrial functional region ( intra - loci ) or between two functional regions ( inter - loci ) . We enumerated co - mutations present among nine mt - genome functional regions . The number of polymorphic sites was normalized by the total number of co - mutating polymorphic sites in a genome group and used to construct Circos plots ( Fig 4 ) . Nine mt - genome functional regions , comprising of four oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) complexes , two RNA and three non - coding regions , displayed diﬀerent preferences to co - mutate with other functional regions . In particular , OXPHOS complexes 13 I , IV and HVS functional regions have a large contribution to the overall co - mutation conﬁguration in each network . To know more on how each functional region has contributed in forming co - mutations , we plotted the number of co - mutations in each functional region against the corresponding functional region size for intra - and inter - loci ( Fig 4 ) . It was observed that co - mutations among functional regions were evenly distributed among both intra - and inter - loci in AM and AS . However , intra - loci were more evenly distributed as compared to inter - loci . Interestingly , we reported few functional regions found to be outside the 95 % conﬁdence intervals in both intra - and inter - loci ( Fig 4 ) . For intra - loci , rRNA was an outlier in all populations , HVS in AF and OC whereas COX in AM and EU . For inter - loci , HVS was an outlier in AF , EU , and OC whereas COX in AM and AS . ATP and miscellaneous regions were outliers in AM , tRNA in AS and rRNA in OC . These statistical outlier regions should have an assertive evolutionary role in a population . To explore this further , we studied how these groups were separated from each other . We calculated Frobenius distances between each pair of ﬁve co - mutation matrices and then performed hierarchical clustering . A dendrogram clearly showed the separation of ﬁve genome groups into two main branches i . e . { AM , AS } and { AF , EU , and OC } ( Fig 5 ) . To investigate global level co - mutation preferences between functional regions , we analyzed unique co - mutations from all the genome groups . Fewer co - mutation pairs were formulated among intra - loci than inter - loci . This relationship between co - mutations and the spatial proximity is shown to be conserved in the mt - genome since all 13 protein - coding genes formed many interactions with OXPHOS complexes ( Wong , et al . , 1975 ; Thompson , et al . , 1994 ) . However , co - mutation pairs formed among OXPHOS complex I or ND genes which make 38 % of total mt - genome participated in 31 % of inter - loci co - mutations but only 13 % of intra - loci co - mutations . Both D - Loop and all three hypervariable regions displayed a tendency to co - mutate with almost all other mt - genome loci ( Fig 4 ) . The rRNA genes make - up 15 % of total mt - genome 14 All AF AM AS EU OC M i s c M i s c M i s c Figure 4 : Comparison of polymorphism among genomic loci . A co - mutation conﬁguration in the human mt - genome co - mutation network consisting of nine functional regions . These nine regions were four mitochondrial complexes ( ND , COX , ATP , and CYB ) , three non - coding regions ( DLoop , HVS , Miscellaneous ) and two RNA regions ( rRNA and tRNA ) . Links or ribbons represent the frequency of CO pairs between two genomic loci . The four functional regions make the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation machinery .

Here , α , N P , N , N C , (cid:104) K (cid:105) , (cid:104) C (cid:105) , r , Q represent the co - mutation frequency , number of polymorphic sites , number of nodes , number of edges , the average degree , the clustering coeﬃcient , the assortativity coeﬃcient and modularity coeﬃcient for both real - world co - mutation networks and random networks , respectively . All ﬁve networks were sparse , disassortative and modular in nature . Network statistics of the largest connected component and the disconnected components are given in S1 Table and S2 Table . The number of nodes and edges forming ﬁnal co - mutation networks were found to be diﬀerent for each genome group . 1000 degree sequence preserved random networks are constructed for comparison of modularity in each co - mutation network and standard deviation was found to be less than 0 . 002 in average Q values of corresponding random networks . but they participated in only 9 % of co - mutating sites . All 22 tRNA genes , which make 9 % of total mt - genome , participated in 10 % of co - mutating sites . Overall , co - mutations dispersed among mt - genome functional regions showed that formation of co - mutations was driven mainly by local preferences within each group . Furthermore , to investigate whether the identiﬁed co - mutations can be mapped with previously known potential disease alleles , we extracted information about potential disease alleles from Mitomap ( Ruiz - Pesini , et al . , 2006 ) , OMIM ( Hamosh , et al . , 2005 ) , and COSMIC ( Bamford , et al . , 2004 ) databases . There were 5 , 74 , 34 , 8 , and 10 co - mutations mapped for AF , AM , AS , EU , and OC genome groups respectively . The full list of co - mutations mapped with potential disease allele is given in File S3 and Table S6 . 3 . 1 . 2 . Co - mutation networks exhibited similar network properties Pair - wise co - mutations were not suﬃcient to fully reveal the underlying structure of functionally related nucleotide positions . As described in Fig 1 , 16 F r o b e n i u s d i s t a n c e Figure 5 : Relationships among genome groups . These relationships are predicted based on polymorphisms shown by their functional genomic loci . Five genome groups were classiﬁed as two main branches of the dendrogram , i . e . { AM , AS } and { AF , EU , and OC } . Here , Frobenius distance between co - mutation conﬁguration matrices of diﬀerent genome groups were used to deﬁne height of dendrogram . The branch separations shown in plot supports the routes of human migrations earlier discovered using global mt - genome mutational phylogeny . In particular , Asian haplogroup M and European haplogroup N arose from the African haplogroup L3 ( Wallace , et al . , 1999 ) . Haplogroup M gave rise to the haplogroups A , B , C , D , G , and F ( Wallace , et al . , 1999 ) in which Haplogroups A , B , C , and D populated East Asia and the Americas . In Europe , haplogroup N led to the European haplogroups H , J , T , U , and V ( Torroni , et al . , 1996 ) whereas Haplogroups S , P , and Q are found in Oceania ( Ruiz - Pesini , et al . , 2006 ) . 17 a co - mutation network was constructed for each genome group where poly - morphic sites forming co - mutations constituted nodes , and edges represented co - mutating nucleotide positions . All ﬁve networks exhibited high average clustering coeﬃcient , (cid:104) C (cid:105) values ( Table 2 ) , suggesting that the nodes of these networks are densely connected . Most real - world networks , particularly social networks , characterized by high (cid:104) C (cid:105) value , suggesting movie actors tend to create tightly knit groups by high compact ties ( Sarkar , et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , all ﬁve networks displayed a highly negative degree - degree coeﬃcient ( r ) ( Table 2 ) , suggesting that co - mutation networks were dis - assortative where high degree nodes , on average , prefer to link to low degree nodes ( Newman , et al . , 2003 ) . Many biological and social networks have negative r values , suggesting that lack of a high degree node in a disassortative network has a large eﬀect on the connectedness of the network ( Newman , et al . , 2003 ; Shinde , et al . , 2015 ; Sarkar , et al . , 2016 ) . Overall , co - mutation networks have shown both the properties of high clustering and disassortative nature . This suggests the presence of dense subgraphs within the network and the pres - ence of hierarchical structures . To explore more about the local interaction patterns in co - mutation networks , we investigated module structures within these networks . 3 . 2 . High cohesiveness and hierarchical organization of co - mutation commu - nities Is real - world network organization driven by the non - random character , at least to some extent , by modules present in the network ? If this is the case , it is expected that modules would be overrepresented in original co - mutation networks compared to their counterparts such as random networks of the same size ( Prill , et al . , 2005 ) . To test this , we generated random networks , referred to as a conﬁguration model , with the same degree sequence as the original co - mutation network ( Csardi , and Nepusz . , 2006 ) . Random networks lack organizing principles , therefore , the presence of modules in a random network is determined by the density of edges ( Itzkovitz , et al . , 2003 ) . 18 Figure 6 : Identiﬁcation and characterization of network modules . Network mod - ules are identiﬁed using Louvain modularity algorithm . Here , the network view of modules is shown for OC network . Each network comprised of one large size module . Each polymor - phic site in a module was classiﬁed as an ancestral or ancestral - variant polymorphic site . Further , modules are classiﬁed into three categories : ancestral allele module ( ancestral polymorphic sites ) , ancestral - variant module ( ancestral - variant polymorphic sites ) and mixed module ( both ancestral and ancestral - variant polymorphic sites ) . 19 The major challenge for identifying modules in a hierarchical organization is to decide the depth to decompose the network , as the Louvain algorithm fragments networks and subsequently modules until it ﬁnds the greatest partition ( Meunier , et al . , 2009 ) . In order to avoid large numbers of smaller modules ( size 2 ) , the size of the second largest connected component was used to decipher submodules among each hierarchy of parent modules . The size of the second largest connected component was 11 , 8 , 9 , 6 , and 12 for AF , AM , AS , EU , OC genome groups respectively . We calculated the modularity coeﬃcient ( Q ) for ﬁve ﬁnal co - mutation networks and also for corresponding random networks ( Table 2 ) . Q value ranges between - 1 and 1 , where it takes positive values if there are more edges between same - group vertices than expected , and negative values if there are less ( Blondel , et al . , 2008 ) . We tested the hypothesis that the average Q of random networks equals that of the co - mutation network . Q value was clearly reduced in the randomized networks ( t - test , p < 0 . 001 , for all co - mutation networks ) , relative to the original data , indicating that our results on real - world co - mutation networks were not trivially reproduced in random networks . A high Q value will manifest if networks are modular in nature . There were 557 , 571 , 552 , 622 , and 227 modules obtained for AF , AM , AS , EU , and OC genome groups respectively . The full list of modules is provided in S2 File . In these networks , small sized modules ( size less than 20 ) were predominant alongside one or two large sized modules i . e . AF ( size of 119 ) , AM ( 270 ) , AS ( 217 and 216 ) , AS ( 294 ) and OC ( 104 ) ( S5 Fig ) . This signature of large - sized modules found in co - mutation networks was not displayed by corresponding random networks . Interestingly , large sized modules were only comprised of polymorphic sites from non - coding regions ( except in OC ) . Similarly to co - mutations , we also noted that polymorphic sites among each module could be from any of mt - genome loci . For example , in the OC population , module 59 had polymorphic sites only from COX1 gene , whereas module 3 had all polymorphic sites from diﬀerent genes ( S2 File ) . We noted that protein - coding 20 functional regions have a predominant role in the formation of modules ( S7 Table and S8 Table ) . Particularly , ND and COX participated in > 65 % and > 40 % of modules in each of the ﬁve networks , respectively . Additionally , we also observed a total of 391 modules out of a total of 2529 modules where all polymorphic sites in the module were from a single functional group . Such mono - functional region modules were also prevailed by ND and COX functional regions , 70 % and 14 % of total mono - functional region modules , respectively ( S7 Table ) .

Count of modules among each genome group and percentage of nodes participating in those modules ( brackets ) is given . Mixed modules observed to the conﬁned of the largest size modules . 1 referes ancestral lineage polymorphic sites ( ALPS ) 3 . 3 . Modules of co - mutating polymorphic sites indicate ancestral relationships To investigate if the modules identiﬁed from the analysis of the network structure were evolutionarily related , we examined polymorphic sites in the individual modules for ancestral alleles from the Reconstructed Sapiens Reference Sequence ( RSRS ) . If a non - RSRS allele was present in more than 21 1 % of samples in a genome group , we termed it an ancestral - variant allele . Thus , we assigned ancestral - variant information to all of the network modules and noted three distinct types of modules ( Fig 6 ) , which are explained in following . In the ﬁrst and most common ( more than 90 % of total modules ) , all polymorphic sites were closely related to ancestral alleles ( Table 3 ) and we termed them ancestral allele modules . All the polymorphic sites in these modules had ancestral alleles ( or non - RSRS alleles present in < 1 % of samples ) . Ancestral alleles were reported to be common throughout human mt - genome tree ( Ruiz - Pesini , et al . , 2006 ) and were also observed in large numbers in our genome group data ( Table 3 ) . In the second type of module , all the polymorphic sites were ancestral - variant alleles . We termed them as ancestral - variant modules and were of our particular interest because all polymorphic sites among these modules consist of the evolved character from RSRS . Ancestral - variant modules were observed the least out of three types of modules , both in terms of module count and the number of polymorphic sites present in these modules ( Table 3 ) . In the third type of module , polymorphic sites in a module were a mixture of ancestral and ancestral - variant alleles , and we termed them mixed modules . The polymorphic sites among these modules were hypothesized to have recently diverged . Mixed modules comprised of the large - sized modules , therefore even though the module count was found to be lower , these mixed modules still possessed a higher number of nodes ( Table 3 ) . We also conﬁrmed that count of each module type in all ﬁve co - mutation networks is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than those of corresponding random networks ( t - test , p < 0 . 0001 ; Fig S8 , S9 , S10 ) . In addition , ancestral - variant modules were diﬃcult to produce in random networks . Modules were mapped to all known haplogroups , which showed that each polymorphic site contributed to one or many haplogroups , and thus entire module structure can be related to a single mt - genome haplogroup ( S2 File ) . Further , we investigated the relationship between modules corresponding to 22 ancestral haplogroup lineage markers ( or top - level haplogroups ) . Information of ancestral lineage markers was taken from the Mitomap database , and polymorphic sites among each module were mapped to ancestral lineage markers . These ancestral lineage markers were observed to participate in the formation of entire module structures , and there were a total of 38 such modules structures obtained ( Table 3 ; File S1 ) . Out of the observed 38 modules , where all nodes were ancestral lineage polymorphic sites , 23 were ancestral - variant modules , 13 were ancestral modules , and two were mixed modules . Since all polymorphic sites among these 38 modules were the ancestral lineage markers , it would be reasonable to say that not only sub - level haplogroups but also top - level haplogroup markers have shown a tendency to be associated to each other . 4 . Discussion We used comparative genome analysis to investigate 24 , 167 mt - genomes and devised a network model comprising pairs of co - mutating nucleotides over the human mt - genome . The method presented here provides a perspective on epistatic interactions using only sequence information as well as serves as a comparative tool to understand intra - species variations . Our study showed the presence of heterogeneity in both epistatic mutations and functional modules across investigated genome groups . The comparison of observed polymorphisms with gene size clearly showed two essential features in providing maximum functional level diversity with the minimum level of genomic changes . First , genetic conservation at CP 2 but not at CP 3 , was key to providing a protein diversity of mt - genome complexes . Second , the restriction of mutations in tRNA and rRNA . These two observations of biases against mutations at CP 2 and RNA genes were earlier reported by Pereira et al . with 5140 human mt - genome sequences ( Pereira , et al . , 2009 ) . The similar biases of CP 2 and tRNA genes were also reported among mt - genomes of other primates including Macaca , Papio , 23 Hylobates , Pongo , Gorilla , and Pan whereby the strength of selection was determined in each lineage by the ancestral state of each codon position ( Kivisild , et al . , 2006 ) . Among non - coding genes , all three HVS regions have displayed a higher level of polymorphisms , whereas genes of rRNA and tRNA have shown lower levels of polymorphism . Our study , apart from providing the detailed enlisting of diversity present among ﬁve genome groups , reiterated that both codon level mutation bias and restriction of mutations among RNA genes were more evident at the subpopulation level despite infrequently reported to be at a global level . Furthermore , given the ubiquitous variation in mt - genome , genetic ﬂexibility may have evolved as a mechanism to maintain OXPHOS under a range of environments . As well as biases against polymorphisms at CP 2 in protein - coding genes , our analysis indicates other biases with co - mutations . First , our results with intra - and inter - loci preferences clearly suggested the dominance of polygenic mutations in the human mt - genome . These polygenic mutations are the outcome of a highly constrained organization of OXPHOS complexes ( Fonseca , et al . , 2008 ) and also due to protein - protein interactions of the mt - interactome ( Schweppe , et al . , 2017 ) . Second , our analysis highlights regions of the mt - genome which are rich in co - mutations and thus suggests the presence of epistasis . In particular , a large portion of COX genes co - mutate in AS and AM populations whereas in AF , EU and OC populations , there was greater co - mutation bias in functional regions of HVS . Although mitochondrial genome epistasis is largely described in the context of mitochondrial - nuclear interaction due to the closed assembly of OXPHOS complexes ( Fonseca , et al . , 2008 ; Picard , et al . , 2018 ; Connallon , et al . , 2018 ; Schweppe , et al . , 2017 ) , there are many reports describing the presence of mitochondrial - mitochondrial epistasis , for example , shared family features in Han Chinese family ( Wang , et al . , 2015 ) and homoplasy guided by mt - tRNA genes ( Moreno - Loshuertos , et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , few co - mutations were found to be mapped with previously known potential disease alleles , implicating association of disease 24 phenotypes within mt - genome sequences . Mitochondrial epistasis has been reported for its role in mitochondrial diseases ( Morrow , and Camus . , 2017 ; Smith , and Lusis . , 2002 ; Pritchard , et al . , 2010 ; Schrider , and Kern . , 2017 ) . We also note that these individual mapped co - mutations do not possess potential disease alleles in other genome groups . In view that mt - genome lineages are functionally diﬀerent , it reﬂects that the same epistatic interaction can be advantageous in one environment and might be maladaptive in a diﬀerent environment ( Mishmar , et al . , 2003 ) . Hence , lineage - deﬁning haplotypes could be contributing to bioenergetic disorders as the migration takes place ( Mishmar , et al . , 2003 ) . Third , similar to polymorphic sites , co - mutations also showed biases at the subpopulation level . Genome group - wise comparison of co - mutations associated with mt - genome functional regions has helped in classifying these ﬁve human subpopulations into two prominent groups i . e . { AF , EU , OC } and { AS , AM } . This result was supported by a global mt - genome mutational phylogeny ( Ruiz - Pesini , et al . , 2006 ) showing the routes of human migrations ( Fig 5 ) . Overall , variations probed by epistatic interactions have provided local preferences among diﬀerent mt - genome loci . These local preferences might have helped in not only forming the closed - assembly of OXPHOS complexes but also classifying subpopulations . In our network model , the emergence of sparse networks was not a smooth , gradual process : the very dense largest connected component collapsed into a sparse largest connected component through a sudden change in the α curve ( Fig 2 ) . For all ﬁve genome groups , we encountered such a distinct phenomenon . A similar critical phenomenon was ﬁrst observed by Erd¨os and R´enyi through their random network model where the isolated nodes and tiny components observed for small (cid:104) K (cid:105) would collapse into one largest connected component ( Erdos and Rnyi . , 1960 ) . Interestingly , the nature of discontinuous transformations was earlier reported in biological networks ( Fontana , and Schuster . , 1998 ; Liu , et al . , 2012 ) and have been hypothesized that biological processes follow discontinuous transformation during their evolution ( Fontana , 25 and Schuster . , 1998 ) . We selected edges for inclusion in co - mutation networks based on their best ﬁt to a network sparseness . Sparseness is one of the essential properties of biological networks since links are more diﬃcult to create due to the evolutionary cost involved in forming more links . It is well known that co - mutational events are very selective and require a group of cooperative supporting mechanisms ( Du , et al . , 2008 ) . Previously , modules of highly correlated genes were identiﬁed using similar edge - ﬁltering based methods like weighted correlation network analysis ( Jackson , et al . , 2018 ) . Network sparseness or similar data - driven approach avoids arbitrary selections of network edges and provides a uniform rationale that can be implemented to generate co - mutation network structures across diﬀerent genome datasets . Therefore , it was reasonable to choose an α value where a network should have both the lowest value of (cid:104) K (cid:105) and the largest component with a higher count of nodes . There was clear evidence for hierarchical modularity in our genome datasets , and the modular structure of the networks at all levels of the hierarchical patterns was reasonably similar across genome groups , suggesting that mt - genome functional modularity is likely to be a replicable phenomenon . A combination of co - mutations at diﬀerent mitochondrial regions , that are closely linked , tend to be inherited together . This study provides a complete listing of the current knowledge of mt - genome variation in the human popu - lation , also with respect to their higher level associations with hierarchical modules . Every set of co - mutations found to originate from and remain part of a preceding single group of co - mutations . This nested hierarchy suggests the conservation of ancestral as well as inherited co - mutations throughout human lineages . Similar hierarchical modularity in brain network was related to func - tional regions in the brain and sub - set of brain functions have been reported to be associated among each hierarchy ( Meunier , et al . , 2009 ) . Modularity is one of the main features of co - mutation networks , and evolutionary processes 26 may favor the emergence of modularity by a combination of structural and functional preferences in forming molecular interactions ( Clune , et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , it was reasonable to say that evolutionary processes may favor modularity by allowing both the speciﬁcity and autonomy of functionally dis - tinct subsets of genomic positions . Overall , we demonstrated that molecular changes , such as mutations , were not randomly distributed across the genome , but instead concentrated within modules . In this sense , the concentration of genomic positions within modules provided a way to understand module integration , favoring distinct functional roles developed by genomic positions in distinct modules . In the human mt - genome , modules were associated with mitochondrial subcomplexes that act in distinct steps of the electron transport assembly and function . Thus , the closed assembly of mitochondrial complexes might favor the emergence of highly integrated genomic subunits , in which eﬀects of pairwise interactions may also activate indirect eﬀects on non - interacting genomic positions associated with the same function ( Fonseca , et al . , 2008 ) . In addition , the OXPHOS system is intrinsically incapable of evolving to a ﬁxed and general optimum state ; therefore , both functional and genetic heterogeneity plays a vital role in providing robustness to the evolving OXPHOS system ( Enriquez . , 2016 ) . Based on these results , we would expect that genome positions connecting modules were more conserved across evolution or , at least , less prone to failures that alter their function . It was expected that module level associations would reﬂect evolutionary relationships between underlying genomic positions as each module consisted of ancestrally similar genomic polymorphisms . Our results added that the distinction between ancestral and ancestral - variant mitochondrial polymor - phisms was clear when the entire module was made up of ancestral - variant polymorphic sites . However , a large number of modules ( more than 90 % of total modules ) were made - up of ancestral polymorphic sites . In addition , the large number of nodes in mixed modules were of ancestral origin ( S2 File ) . Using the list modules of all ﬁve networks , it would be reasonable to assert 27 that contemporary mt - genome nucleotide bases most closely resembled the ancestral state and very few of them were ancestral - variants . This observation was in agreement with previous studies which found co - mutation among nucleotide positions to be higher between genetically similar taxa ( Chaﬀron , et al . , 2010 ) . This fact was widely observed in our data as both sub - level , and top - level haplotype markers were associated with each other in a closed group of network modules . Furthermore , mitochondrial polymorphic positions adapt from ancestral state to ancestral - variant state ( Keightley , and Jackson . , 2018 ) , is also demonstrated by a larger count of transient state mixed modules . Overall , these evolutionarily closed associations suggest that interactions between nucleotide positions might evolve within genetically related genomic polymorphic positions ( more likely of having similar functionality ) responding to intra - species biases ( Du , et al . , 2008 ) . Understanding the formation of the network would require an extension of the described approaches . Here , we used simplistic information possessed by each genome position in terms of their underlying ancestral markers . Previously , this ancestral marker information has been used in order to deﬁne taxa ( precisely haplogroups ) in mitochondrial phylotrees which have provided the exact mapping of mitochondrial signatures to infer the routes of human intra - species diversiﬁcation events ( Nakatsuk , et al . , 2017 ; Derenko , et al . , 2001 ) . Similarly , our co - mutation modules have provided a detailed listing of mitochondrial co - mutations which were ancestrally associated together . Consistent with the proposed importance of mt - genome variation in human adaptation ( Wallace . , 2015 ) , regional haplotypes are generally founded by one or more functionally signiﬁcant polypeptide , tRNA , rRNA , and control region variants . These variant traits , beyond being retained in the descendant popu - lation , manifest functional signatures about aﬀecting phenotypic variations in the subpopulation . Particularly , a list of singular events involving both mt - genome variation and epistatic interactions have been evaluated in terms of aﬀecting phenotypic variation in metabolism , ﬁtness , and life - history traits 28 ( Wallace . , 2015 ; Shlush , et al . , 2008 ; Li , et al . , 2015 ) . Hence , it is intuitive to observe epistatic patterns of both genotype and phenotype variants along with life - history traits at the subpopulation level . However , at the between - population level , the evidence in support of the relationship between human mt - genome variation and the metabolic rate is compelling . 5 . Conclusion We constructed and investigated human mt - genome co - mutation networks of continents using a combined framework of genomics and network theory . Our principal result was that mitochondria undergo substantial levels of co - mutational biases . Codon - level mutation bias , particularly at CP 2 , and restriction of mutations in RNA genes was also evident at the continental level , which was earlier only reported in the global human population . The analysis highlighted regions of mt - genome rich for co - mutations and thus suggested the presence of epistasis . In particular , a large portion of COX and ND genes found to be co - mutated in AS and AM populations whereas in AF , EU , and OC populations , there was greater co - mutation bias between regions of HVS and ND , thus our networks identiﬁed diﬀerences in co - mutation bias between human populations . It was of great interest to investigate and verify diﬀerent co - mutation patterns of various geographical regions . Importantly , we deduced hierarchical modular structures formed within co - mutation networks . Downstream analysis of these modules suggested that contemporary human population are dominated by ancestral states . In addition , ancestral - variant module structures are found to be in a lesser number , and such modules have found to be diﬃcult to produce in corresponding random networks . The analysis presented here can be extended to study the complexity of mt - genome evolution by forming various geographical groups as well as to understand alterations in personal traits leading to complexity in mt - genome evolution . 29 Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests .
