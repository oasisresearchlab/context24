INTRODUCTION A closed lipid membrane is described remarkably well by a geometrical hamiltonian . This hamiltonian is con - structed as a sum of the scalars , truncated at an appropri - ate order , which characterize those features of the mem - brane geometry which are relevant . A term quadratic in the extrinsic curvature provides a measure of the energy penalty associated with bending [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] ; any in - trinsic tendency to bend one way and not the other is captured by a term linear in the extrinsic curvature [ 6 ] . The shape equation determining the equilibria of this membrane is a fourth - order non - linear elliptic PDE of the form ∇ 2 K + ‘ K 3 ’ = 0 , where ∇ 2 is the Laplacian on the membrane , K is the sum of the principal curvatures , and by ‘ K 3 ’ we mean a cubic polynomial in these curva - tures [ 7 ] . Here , we would like to examine the boundary conditions which must supplement this equation when the membrane possesses a free edge . The energy cost associated with this edge is , to a good approximation , proportional to the exposed length . During the forma - tion process , material will either be added to the edge or the edge will heal itself so as to form closed structures . However , unlike a simple soap ﬁlm with a free edge , a lipid membrane does possess stable ( cup shaped ) equi - libria [ 8 ] . An examination of such structures is a small but important step towards a fuller understanding of self assembly . Our primary focus will be on the boundary geometry . We have a surface with a boundary and a certain energy penalty associated with it , a well deﬁned problem in clas - sical ﬁeld theory . The boundary conditions are identiﬁed ∗ Electronic address : capo @ ﬁs . cinvestav . mx † Electronic address : jemal @ nuclecu . unam . mx ‡ Electronic address : santiago @ nuclecu . unam . mx by demanding that the energy be stationary for arbitrary deformations of the edge geometry . In distinction to ear - lier analytic treatments of this problem , we will relax the assumption that the membrane geometry be axially sym - metric [ 8 ] . This is important not only for conceptual rea - sons . Generally , there will be no priveleged parametriza - tion such as that tailored to axial symmetry ; in an axi - ally symmetric geometry the edge itself is simply a circle . We ﬁnd that there are three boundary conditions . As we will demonstrate one of these conditions , involving three derivatives of the embedding function , is satisﬁed identi - cally in the axially symmetric limit . Therefore this limit cannot be considered as a reliable guide to the general case . While the variational approach does capture the ge - ometrical nature of the boundary conditions , the phys - ical interpretation of these conditions still needs to be clariﬁed . Ideally , one would like to interpret them in terms of the balance of forces operating at the edge . To do this in a way which does justice to the geometry , we identify the conserved Noether currents associated with the intrinsic translational invariance of the conﬁguration [ 9 ] . The three , apparently unrelated , boundary condi - tions are now cast in terms of the three components of a single vector identity on the edge . We ﬁnish with a discussion of the eﬀect of a Gaussian rigidity term on a lipid membrane with edges . Whereas such a topological term does not alter the bulk shape equation , we show that it does modify the boundary conditions which apply to it in a way which will have consequences in the bulk . This extension is relevant in topology changing processes . The outline of the paper is as follows . In Sect . II we consider the simple example of a surface tension domi - nated membrane . This allows us to establish our nota - tion and to derive the boundary conditions in a simple context . In Sect . III , we derive the boundary conditions at the edge for a lipid membrane . We then specialize to 2 axially symmetric conﬁgurations to compare our results in this limit with previous work on the subject . In Sect . IV , we consider the balance of the forces operating at the edge and we show how they are related to the bound - ary conditions . The eﬀect of a Gaussian rigidity term to the membrane energy is the subject of Sect . V , where we obtain the appropriate modiﬁcations in the boundary conditions . We end with some remarks in Sect . VI . II . SURFACE TENSION PITTED AGAINST EDGE TENSION It is useful to examine ﬁrst the simpler situation in which the membrane physics is dominated by surface tension , such as a soap ﬁlm with a free edge . Let the membrane surface Σ have an area A , with boundary C of length L , and the tension in the membrane bulk be a constant µ , and that on the edge σ . The energy is then given as a sum of two terms F = µA + σL . ( 1 ) Surface tension tends to decrease the membrane area ; line tension to decrease the length of the free boundary . Without some further reﬁnement this model does not ad - mit stable equilibria . Suppose a hole is punctured in the ﬁlm , then depending on its radius , either the hole will close healing the ﬁlm , or grow and destroy it . An unsta - ble equilibrium clearly exist when the radius is tuned to coincide with a critical value r c . On dimensional ground , one world expect r c ≈ µ / σ . ( We will ignore stability here as our interest in this model is only as a point of reference for a lipid membrane . ) The membrane surface Σ is described by the embed - ding X in three dimensional space R 3 as x = X ( ξ a ) , where x are coordinates for R 3 , and ξ a coordinates for the surface ( a , b , · · · = 1 , 2 ) . Its edge C is embedded in turn as a curve on Σ as ξ a = Y a ( s ) which we parametrize by its arclength s . We can now cast F as F = µ Z Σ d 2 ξ √ γ + σ I C ds . ( 2 ) Here , the metric induced on Σ is given by γ ab = e a · e b , where e a : = ∂ a X are tangent to the surface , γ = det γ ab , and dA = √ γ d 2 ξ . Note that we can also consider the di - rect embedding of the edge C in R 3 , via x = Y ( s ) , where Y = X ( Y a ( s ) ) . The tangent to C in R 3 is equivalently expressed in either of two ways : t = e a t a , where t a = ˙ Y a ; or t = ˙ Y , where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to arclength s . The energy is a functional of the embedding X of Σ in R 3 . There is no need to vary the edge embedding Y a independently : the Y a are ﬁxed by the constraint that the two embeddings agree , Y = X , on C . Equilibrium conﬁgurations are those at which the en - ergy Eq . ( 1 ) is stationary . To derive the equations de - scribing the equilibrium conﬁgurations of a membrane described by this model , we ﬁrst consider a variation of the embedding X of the membrane X → X + δ X . We let n denote the unit normal to the surface Σ . We decom - pose the displacement with respect to the spatial basis adapted to Σ , { e a , n } , as , δ X = Φ a e a + Φ n . ( 3 ) We now have that the induced metric varies according to ( see e . g . [ 9 ] ) δ X γ ab = 2 K ab Φ + ∇ a Φ b + ∇ b Φ a , ( 4 ) where K ab denotes the extrinsic curvature tensor , K ab = e b · ∂ a n , ( 5 ) and ∇ a is the covariant derivative on Σ compatible with γ ab . The derivative terms in the variation of γ ab are its Lie derivative along the tangential vector ﬁeld , Φ a . The variation of A is δ X A = Z Σ dA [ K Φ + ∇ a Φ a ] = Z Σ dA K Φ + I C ds l a Φ a . ( 6 ) The mean extrinsic curvature , K = K ab γ ab . The second line follows from the preceding one using Stoke’s theo - rem . Here l a is the outward pointing normal to C on Σ . Only the normal projection Φ of the variation plays a role in determining the bulk equilibrium of the mem - brane . This is true generally , regardless of the model . In this particular model , however , there is no boundary term associated with the bulk normal displacement Φ . As we will see , this is not generally true — a happy accident when the energy is truncated at the area term . On the other hand , the tangential bulk variation Φ a always gives only a boundary term . This is a consequence of the fact that a tangential deformation corresponds in the bulk to an inﬁnitesimal reparametrization of the surface . There is however a physical displacement of the boundary . In fact , the boundary contribution to Eq . ( 6 ) is easily identi - ﬁed as the change in the surface area of Σ under a normal deformation of its boundary , δY a = ( l b Φ b ) l a , which at each point is directed along the tangent plane of Σ at that point . The projection of Φ b onto the edge C itself , t a Φ a , does not contribute . Let us turn now to the variation of the edge embed - ding Y induced by the bulk variation δ X . It can be decomposed with respect to a basis adapted to both em - beddings , X and Y , given by { t , l , n } , where l = e a l a . Thus at the edge we set δ Y = φ t + ψ l + Φ n , ( 7 ) where the edge and bulk components are identiﬁed by continuity , ψ = l a Φ a and φ = t a Φ a . Modulo a diver - gence associated with a reparametrization of the bound - ary which involves the tangential component φ that we 3 can safely discard , we have for the variation of the in - ﬁnitesimal arclength δ Y ds = ds (cid:0) κ ψ + K k Φ (cid:1) , ( 8 ) where we have used the fact that ˙ t = − κ l − K k n . ( 9 ) Here κ is the geodesic curvature of C associated with its embedding in Σ , and we have deﬁned K k = K ab t a t b . The unconventional minus sign in the ﬁrst term of Eq . ( 9 ) comes about because l is the outward normal to C on Σ , i . e . ˙ t a = − κ l a . The corresponding deformation in L is then given by δ Y L = I C ds (cid:0) κ ψ + K k Φ (cid:1) . ( 10 ) Summing the two contributions ( 6 ) and ( 10 ) to the vari - ation of the energy F , as given by ( 1 ) , we ﬁnd δ X F = µ Z Σ dA K Φ + I C ds (cid:2) ( µ + σ κ ) ψ + σ K k Φ (cid:3) . ( 11 ) The bulk equilibrium is a minimal surface unaﬀected by the boundary , satisfying K = 0 . On the boundary , the projections along the normals to the edge , ψ and Φ , rep - resent independent deformations , so that stationarity of F requires the vanishing of the corresponding coeﬃcents . We thus read oﬀ the two boundary conditions : σ κ + µ = 0 , ( 12 ) σ K k = 0 . ( 13 ) The ﬁrst tells us that the geodesic curvature of the edge as embedded in the membrane is constant . The second simply enforces the vanishing of K k at the edge . Note that the completeness of the basis { t , l } of tangent vec - tors on Σ at C , γ ab = t a t b + l a l b , permits us to ex - press the mean curvature at the edge as K = K k + K ⊥ , where K ⊥ = K ab l a l b . Thus modulo the bulk equilibrium K = 0 , the boundary condition ( 13 ) can be alternatively expressed as K ⊥ = 0 . The only potentially non van - ishing component of K ab on the edge is the oﬀ - diagonal component , K k⊥ = t a l b K ab . For this particular model our approach has been heavy - handed ; the boundary conditions we have written down are an elaborate way to express the simple vector identity σ ˙ t = µ l , ( 14 ) which equates the change in the tension over the interval ∆ s along the edge , σ ∆ t , to the force due to surface ten - sion acting on the edge , µ l ∆ s . The apparent mismatch in counting ( three versus two ) is accounted for by noting that the projection of Eq . ( 14 ) along t is an identity . For higher order models , as we will see , this projection will not be vacuous . Note that had we N sheets conjoined on a single edge , Eq . ( 14 ) gets modiﬁed in an obvious way : σ ˙ t = µ N X i = 1 l i , ( 15 ) where l i is the vector normal to the edge which is tangent to the i th sheet . Eq . ( 15 ) provides a generalization of the Neumann rule for soap bubble clusters at a Plateau border [ 10 ] to accomodate line tension on the edge . A simple application is considered in [ 11 ] . III . LIPID MEMBRANE WITH AN EDGE A lipid membrane is modeled by a phenomenological energy quadratic in the extrinsic curvature of the surface . Let us write this as F b = Z Σ dA F ( γ ab , K ab ) , ( 16 ) i . e . F depends at most on the extrinsic curvature , and not , for example , on its derivative ∇ a K bc . In particu - lar , we will focus on the model described by the Helfrich energy density F = α ( K − K 0 ) 2 + µ . ( 17 ) The spontaneous curvature K 0 is a constant , as is the bending rigidity α . The constant µ is interpreted here as the Lagrange multiplier implementing the constraint on the membrane area . We will discuss the addition of a Gaussian rigidity term in the next section . The energy of the bulk and the edge is F = F b + σL . ( 18 ) The shape equation describing the equilibrium in the bulk , which is derived from the extremization of the en - ergy ( 17 ) α [ − 2 ∇ 2 K + 2 ( K − K 0 ) R + ( K 02 − K 2 ) K ] + µ K = 0 , ( 19 ) is well known [ 7 ] . The structure of this equation has been discussed in detail elsewhere [ 9 ] , where a novel derivation is also provided . The scalar curvature R appearing in Eq . ( 19 ) is related to the extrinsic curvature through the Gauss - Codazzi equation , R = K 2 − K ab K ab . ( 20 ) Under a tangential deformation of the surface , δ k X = Φ a e a , the energy density transforms as a divergence which is transferred to the boundary , δ k F b = I C ds F l a Φ a . ( 21 ) This is because the local scalar energy density F trans - forms as δ k F = Φ a ∂ a F . ( 22 ) 4 The details of F do not enter . Note that Eq . ( 21 ) agrees with the corresponding expression for the area with F = 1 . As before , this boundary term induces a source into the boundary Euler - Lagrange equation . For an edge with a line tension σ , we get the ﬁrst boundary condition , due to a deformation along the normal l , ψ , σκ + F = 0 , ( 23 ) where we have used Eqs . ( 10 ) and ( 21 ) . This should be compared with Eq . ( 12 ) to which it reduces if F = µ , a constant . This boundary condition relates the geometry of the edge to the extrinsic curvature of the membrane evaluated at the boundary . We now examine a normal deformation of the surface Σ , δ ⊥ X = Φ n . The shape equation ( 19 ) determining the local membrane equilibrium is obtained by demand - ing that the energy be stationary with respect to normal deformations of Σ which may or may not vanish on the boundary . As such this equation cannot be aﬀected by the addition of a boundary . To determine the boundary conditions we need to extend the support of the varia - tion to include the boundary . We have that the normal variation of the bulk energy can be written as δ ⊥ F b = Z dA (cid:2) F K Φ + 2 Γ ab K ab Φ + F ab δ ⊥ K ab (cid:3) , ( 24 ) where Γ ab = ∂ F / ∂γ ab and F ab = ∂ F / ∂K ab . The bound - ary term we wish to identify in δ ⊥ F b originates in the δ ⊥ K ab term in this expression . We recall that the ex - trinsic curvature transforms as follows under a normal deformation of Σ ( see e . g . [ 9 ] ) : δ ⊥ K ab = −∇ a ∇ b Φ + K ac K c b Φ . ( 25 ) We thus have that δ ⊥ F b = Z dA h E Φ + ∇ a (cid:16) Φ ∇ b F ab − F ab ∇ b Φ (cid:17)i , ( 26 ) where we have deﬁned the Euler - Lagrange derivative E = ( −∇ a ∇ b + K ac K cb ) F ab + F K + 2 Γ ab K ab . ( 27 ) Thus , modulo the bulk shape equation , E = 0 , we get that the boundary contribution is δ ⊥ F b = I C ds l a (cid:2) Φ ∇ b F ab − F ab ∇ b Φ (cid:3) . ( 28 ) The terms proportional to ∇ a Φ and Φ are not indepen - dent : the projection of ∇ a Φ along the edge is completely determined once Φ is speciﬁed on C . To decompose δ ⊥ F into two independent parts we proceed as follows : we ﬁrst decompose ∇ a Φ into its normal and tangential parts with respect to C , ∇ a Φ = l a ∇ ⊥ Φ + t a ˙Φ , ( 29 ) where we have deﬁned ∇ ⊥ = l a ∇ a . We now perform an integration by parts on the ˙Φ term to obtain for the second term on the right hand side of Eq . ( 28 ) I C ds l a F ab ∇ b Φ = I C ds (cid:20) l a l b F ab ∇ ⊥ Φ − Φ d ds (cid:16) l a F ab t b (cid:17)(cid:21) , ( 30 ) where we have discarded a total derivative term with respect to arclength . In this way we succeed in isolating the independent normal variations at the boundary , the coeﬃcients of Φ and ∇ ⊥ Φ . From Eqs . ( 10 ) , ( 28 ) , ( 30 ) , we obtain that the total boundary contribution of the normal variations is δ ⊥ F b = I C ds n − l a l b F ab ∇ ⊥ Φ + h l a ∇ b F ab + d ds (cid:16) l a F ab t b (cid:17) + σK k i Φ o , ( 31 ) so that we can immediately read oﬀ the two boundary conditions which supplement Eq . ( 23 ) , l a ∇ b F ab + d ds (cid:16) l a F ab t b (cid:17) + σK k = 0 , ( 32 ) l a l b F ab = 0 . ( 33 ) The ﬁrst is of third order in derivatives of the embedding functions . This is consistent with the fact that the shape equation ( 19 ) is of fourth order . Using the decomposition of the covariant derivative ( 29 ) , it can be written in the alternative form l a l b ∇ ⊥ F ab + 2 d ds (cid:16) l a F ab t b (cid:17) + κ ( l a l b − t a t b ) F ab + σK k = 0 . ( 34 ) In the case of a membrane described by the Helfrich Hamiltonian ( 17 ) with an edge the third boundary con - dition ( 33 ) implies K = K 0 , ( 35 ) on the edge — the rigid membrane necessarily has a con - stant mean curvature at the edge equal to its spontaneous value . This is entirely independent of the tensions , µ or σ , or of the rigidity modulus . If K 0 = 0 , the membrane is minimal at its edge . The second boundary condition ( 32 ) is of Robin type . For any F which is a function only of K , we have that F ab ∝ γ ab , so that the middle term in ( 32 ) vanishes , l a F ab t b = 0 , ( 36 ) and the boundary condition reduces to 2 α ∇ ⊥ K + σK k = 0 . ( 37 ) This equation determines the normal derivative of K in terms of the component of the extrinsic curvature tan - gent to the edge . It does not involve the surface tension 5 µ . We emphasize that its existence seems to have gone unnoticed . The ﬁrst boundary condition , Eq . ( 23 ) , together with Eq . ( 35 ) , implies that on the edge σκ + µ = 0 . ( 38 ) The geodesic curvature of a loaded boundary is com - pletely ﬁxed by the ratio of the tensions in exactly the same way as in the previous section for soap bubbles , see Eq . ( 12 ) . If µ = 0 the edge is necessarily a geodesic of the bulk geometry . If the line tension on the boundary vanishes , σ = 0 , the consistency of Eq . ( 35 ) with ( 23 ) requires that µ = 0 also . Furthermore Eq . ( 37 ) implies ∇ ⊥ K = 0 on the boundary . But the unique solution satisfying the two boundary con - ditions K = K 0 and ∇ ⊥ K = 0 is K = K 0 everywhere . One way to see this is to construct the Gaussian nor - mal coordinates adapted to the edge , ( l , s ) , where l is the length of the geodesic which intersects the edge nor - mally . With respect to this system of coordinates , the Laplacian assumes the form ∇ 2 = ∂ 2 l + κ∂ l + ∂ 2 s in the neighborhood of the edge . Thus , modulo the boundary conditions , ∇ 2 K = ∂ 2 l K on the edge . But Eq . ( 19 ) im - plies that ∇ 2 K = 0 there so that ∂ 2 l K and all higher derivatives vanish . If K is analytic in l , then K = K 0 . If µ 6 = 0 , there is no such constraint . The geometry is very severely constrained by the boundary conditions . Let us now examine an axially symmetric membrane with an axially symmetric edge . With respect to cylin - drical polar cooordinates { ρ , z , ϕ } on R 3 , the membrane is described by ρ = R ( ℓ ) , z = Z ( ℓ ) where Z ′ 2 + R ′ 2 = 1 . ℓ is the arc length along a a curve with ﬁxed ϕ , and the primes denote a derivative with respect to ℓ . The intrin - sic geometry of Σ is described by the line element dτ 2 = dℓ 2 + R 2 ( ℓ ) dϕ 2 , ( 39 ) We can write the extrinsic curvature in a form consistent with axial symmetry as K ab = ℓ a ℓ b K ℓ + ( γ ab − ℓ a ℓ b ) K R , ( 40 ) where K l and K R are two spatial scalars which we iden - tify as the principal curvatures of the embedding of Σ in R 3 , ℓ a is the outward pointing unit normal to the circle of ﬁxed ℓ , ℓ a = ( 1 , 0 ) . The mean curvature is K = K ℓ + K R . To evaluate the principal curvatures , it is convenient to deﬁne Θ as the angle which the tangent to a curve of ﬁxed ϕ makes with the cylindrical radial direction : d Z dR = tan Θ . ( 41 ) We then have Z ′ = sin Θ , and R ′ = cos Θ , so that the principal curvatures are K ℓ = Θ ′ , K R = sin Θ R . ( 42 ) Axial symmetry implies that the fourth order shape equa - tion can be integrated to provide a third order equation for R as a function of ℓ . It has been shown elsewhere ( [ 12 , 13 ] , see also [ 9 ] ) that this equation takes the form − 2 α cos Θ (cid:18) Θ ′ + sin Θ R (cid:19) ′ + α ( Θ ′ + sin Θ R ) ( Θ ′ − sin Θ R ) sin Θ + 2 αK 0 sin 2 Θ R − ( µ + αK 20 ) sin Θ = 0 . ( 43 ) If the boundary C is also axially symmetric so that it coincides with a ﬁxed value of ℓ then l a = ℓ a , K k = K R , K ⊥ = K ℓ and K k⊥ = 0 . It is simple to show that κ = − R ′ / R . We thus have for the boundary conditions , Eqs . ( 35 ) and ( 38 ) , Θ ′ + sin Θ / R = K 0 , σR ′ = µR . ( 44 ) The remaining boundary condition , Eq . ( 37 ) , of third or - der in derivatives appears to present a problem : a third order ODE does not admit third order boundary con - ditions . The inconsistency , however , is only apparent : on the boundary , the shape equation Eq . ( 43 ) itself re - produces , modulo Eqs . ( 44 ) , the troublesome boundary condition Eq . ( 37 ) . Our analysis is thus completely con - sistent with the axially symmetric analysis of [ 8 ] where the boundary conditions Eqs . ( 23 ) and ( 33 ) are derived . It is worth stressing , however , that potential pitfalls of us - ing the axially symmetric problem as a guide to the more general problem . The boundary condition ( 32 ) is a non - trivial constraint on the geometry which is not already encoded in the shape equation for non - axially symmetric conﬁgurations . IV . BALANCE OF FORCES In this section , we consider the balance of the forces operating at the edge . This provides the missing intuition on the physical origin of the boundary conditions we have derived in the previous section . Consider a point on the edge . In equilibrium , the ten - sion g must satisfy ˙ g = f a l a . ( 45 ) Here f a is the membrane stress tensor so that f a l a is the ‘surface tension’ acting on the edge due to unbalanced 6 stresses in the bulk at its boundary . In [ 9 ] , it was shown that the bulk stress tensor for the model deﬁned by the Helfrich energy ( 17 ) can be expressed in the form f a = [ 2 αK ( K ab − K 2 γ ab ) − 2 αK 0 ( K ab − Kγ ab ) − ( µ + αK 2 0 ) γ ab ] e b − 2 α ∇ a K n . ( 46 ) Thus its projection along the normal to the edge l a is f a l a = (cid:8) 2 α ( K − K 0 ) K ⊥ − α ( K − K 0 ) 2 − µ (cid:9) l + 2 α ( K − K 0 ) K k⊥ t − 2 α ∇ ⊥ K n . ( 47 ) In addition , as we have seen in Sect . II , g = − σ t . ( 48 ) Using Eq . ( 9 ) for ˙ t , we read oﬀ the three components of Eq . ( 45 ) , σκ = 2 α ( K − K 0 ) K ⊥ − α ( K − K 0 ) 2 − µ , ( 49 ) σK k = − 2 α ∇ ⊥ K , ( 50 ) 0 = 2 α ( K − K 0 ) K k⊥ , ( 51 ) respectively along l , n , and t . The condition ( 50 ) co - incides with the boundary condition ( 37 ) . If K k⊥ 6 = 0 , Eq . ( 51 ) implies that K = K 0 . The remaining boundary condition ( 49 ) then coincides with a linear combination of the boundary conditions ( 35 ) and ( 38 ) . In the axially symmetric geometry , however , K k⊥ does vanish so that ( 51 ) does not imply K = K 0 as it stands . One needs then to appeal to the integrated shape equation ( 43 ) , which together with ( 49 ) and ( 50 ) reproduce K = K 0 . We thus have identiﬁed a very simple ( if heavily dis - guised ) physical interpretation of the boundary condi - tions . In particular , in this approach , the boundary con - dition K = K 0 emerges as the vanishing of the stress induced by the bulk along the edge . Note that the vari - ational approach did not rely on the identiﬁcation of projections . Indeed , the boundary condition correspond - ing to the projection along t was originally identiﬁed by demanding stationary energy for independent boundary variations of ∇ ⊥ Φ . We also note that the form of Eq . ( 45 ) implies the in - tegrability condition , I C ds f a l a = 0 ( 52 ) on the edge . The existence of these three extremely non - trivial conditions is far from obvious in our previous ap - proach . One can say more . Take the equation , ∇ a f a = 0 , de - scribing the conservation of the stress tensor . dot it into X and integrate over the membrane surface . We get Z dA ∇ a ( X · f a ) = Z dA e a · f a . ( 53 ) Working on the right , we have Z dA ∇ a ( X · f a ) = I ds X · l a f a = I ds X · ˙ g = − I ds t · g = σL , ( 54 ) where we have used Eq . ( 45 ) on the second line , as well as Eq . ( 48 ) on the last line . On the other hand , if we write f a = f ab e b + f a n , then Z dA e a · f a = Z dA f aa . ( 55 ) We note that the bending energy R dA K 2 is a conformal invariant , and so does not contribute to the trace f a a . We have f aa = 2 ( αK 0 ( K − K 0 ) − µ ) , so that 2 µA − 2 αK 0 Z dA ( K − K 0 ) + σL = 0 . ( 56 ) This condition is useful for identifying the sign associated with the mulupliers . For example , if K 0 = 0 , it is clear that µ is necessarily negative . V . GAUSSIAN RIGIDITY The geometrical scalars we can construct with dimen - sion [ Length ] − 2 are R , K 2 and K ab K ab . The Gauss - Codazzi equation ( 20 ) tells us that the three scalar in - variants R , K 2 and K ab K ab are not independent . In addition , the Gauss - Bonnet functional I = Z Σ dA R ( 57 ) is a topological invariant if the membrane is closed . More generally for an open membrane , I = Z Σ dA R + 2 I C ds κ ( 58 ) is a topological invariant . A consequence is that if a Gaussian rigidity term is included in the energy a line rigidity H dsκ is necessarily induced along its boundary . To obtain the variation of the Gaussian term , we need to know how the scalar curvature varies . Its tangential deformation is straightforward ; to determine its normal deformation , we exploit Eq . ( 20 ) and with it the technol - ogy developed Sects . II and III . Consider now a Gaussian rigidity addition to the bulk energy , so that F = F b + β Z dA R , ( 59 ) 7 Whereas the bulk shape equation is unmodiﬁed , all three boundary conditions are changed : α ( K − K 0 ) 2 + β R + µ + σκ = 0 , ( 60 ) 2 α ∇ ⊥ K − 2 β ˙ K k⊥ + σK k = 0 , ( 61 ) α ( K − K 0 ) + βK k = 0 . ( 62 ) We note that the Gauss - Codazzi equation ( 20 ) allows us to express R in terms of the projections of K ab with respect to the edge , R = 2 ( K k K ⊥ − K k⊥ 2 ) . Eq . ( 60 ) is quadratic in the extrinsic curvature . Eqs . ( 61 ) and ( 62 ) by constrast are linear relationship between K ⊥ and K k . Note that , unlike the case of the pure Helfrich model , the central term in Eq . ( 61 ) does not vanish in general . However , it does vanish in an axially symmetric geometry ( with axially symmetric edge ) , K k⊥ = 0 . More generally , we have the integral statement I C ds (cid:2) 2 α ∇ ⊥ K + σK k (cid:3) = 0 . ( 63 ) In an axially symmetric geometry one can check that , modulo the lower order boundary conditions ( 60 ) and ( 62 ) , Eq . ( 43 ) reproduces Eq . ( 61 ) on the boundary . Let us consider now the balance of the forces in this case . The Gaussian term makes no contribution to f a [ 9 ] . Naively reinvoking Eq . ( 45 ) would appear to suggest that this term cannot modify the boundary conditions , in contradiction with what we have just derived . However , with a general function F and in particular for β R , the term d / ds ( l a F ab t b ) Φ appearing in its normal variation ( see Eq . ( 30 ) ) will be non - vanishing , and it is no longer appropriate to discard a total derivative as we did in deriving Eq . ( 30 ) . For consistency , we claim therefore that we need to modify Eq . ( 45 ) as follows : g → g − l a F ab t b n . ( 64 ) For Gauss - Bonnet , the second term reads − 2 βK k⊥ n . This mysterious term is precisely the tension associated with the edge energy H C ds κ . The projections of Eq . ( 45 ) along l , n and t respectively then read α [ ( K − K 0 ) 2 − 2 ( K − K 0 ) K ⊥ ] − 2 βK 2 k⊥ + σκ + µ = 0 , ( 65 ) 2 α ∇ ⊥ K − 2 β ˙ K k⊥ + σK k = 0 , ( 66 ) 2 K k⊥ [ α ( K − K 0 ) + βK k ] = 0 , ( 67 ) where we have used the fact that , at the edge , ˙ n = K k t + K k⊥ l . ( 68 ) As was the case in the previous section , these coin - cide with the boundary conditions ( 60 ) , ( 61 ) , ( 62 ) when K k⊥ 6 = 0 . VI . CONCLUSIONS Whereas for a soap ﬁlm , it is very simple to identify the forces operating on the edge , and so read oﬀ the boundary conditions on the bulk geometry , such an approach is less obvious for a membrane . However , we have demonstrated how simple geometrical and variational arguments may be exploited to derive the boundary conditions on the lipid membrane geometry . We have made no restrictive assumptions about the symmetry of the conﬁguration . We then showed how these boundary conditions emerge from a balance of forces projected along a basis of vectors adapted to the edge . We plan at a future date to examine the axially sym - metric shape equation subject to the Gauss - Bonnet mod - iﬁed boundary conditions . Matching observed conﬁgura - tions with solutions of the shape equation in this more general setting provides a method , at least in principle , for determining the values of the two bulk rigidity mod - uli .
