Few evidence mostly originating from studies of rhodopsin suggest that PUFAs 44 directly modulate the conformational dynamic of transmembrane proteins . However , whether 45 such properties translate to other G protein - coupled receptors remains unclear . We focused 46 on the dopamine D2 receptor ( D2R ) , a main target of antipsychotics . Membrane enrichment in 47 n - 3 , but not n - 6 , PUFAs potentiates ligand binding . Molecular dynamics simulations show that 48 the D2R preferentially interacts with n - 3 over n - 6 PUFAs . Furthermore , even though this mildly 49 affects signalling in heterologous systems , in vivo n - 3 PUFA deficiency blunts the effects of 50 D2R ligands . These results suggest that n - 3 PUFAs act as allosteric modulators of the D2R 51 and provide a putative mechanism for their potentiating effect on antipsychotic efficacy . 52 53 3 Introduction 54 Biological membranes are not homogeneous bilayers but rather composed of different lipid 55 species with various chemical and biophysical properties that actively modulate protein 56 localization and function , signaling or vesicular trafficking 1 . However , several aspects of 57 membrane complexity including the impact of lipid heterogeneity across tissues , cells , and 58 subcellular compartments on cell signaling and physiology are only starting to emerge . 59 60 This is particularly true for neuronal function for which the impact of membrane lipid 61 composition has been largely overlooked , despite that the brain has the second highest lipid 62 content after adipose tissue 2 . Yet , convergent findings support some links between lipid 63 biostatus and mental health . For instance , a decrease in the levels of n - 3 polyunsaturated fatty 64 acids ( PUFAs ) - containing phospholipids has been consistently described in a subset of 65 patients suffering from neurodevelopmental psychiatric diseases 3 . Likewise , recent 66 transcriptomic profiling studies revealed a common pattern in fatty acid metabolic pathways in 67 several psychiatric disorders 4 , 5 . Moreover , n - 3 PUFA deficiency in rodent models has been 68 associated with putative pathophysiological mechanisms involving alteration in neurogenesis , 69 neuronal migration , neuromodulation , and neuroinflammatory processes in various brain 70 regions 2 , 6 , 7 . These findings remain largely correlative and the precise mechanisms by which 71 PUFA biostatus directly or indirectly accounts for changes in neuronal function remain largely 72 unknown . Nevertheless , several studies have demonstrated that membrane lipids regulate the 73 function of key transmembrane proteins 8 including ion channels and GPCRs 9 , 10 . 74 75 The activity of the dopamine D2 receptor ( D2R ) is particularly relevant in this context . Various 76 psychiatric disorders , including those where levels of brain n - 3 PUFAs are low 11 , display 77 altered patterns of D2R - dependent signaling , and this GPCR is , therefore , a key target in 78 several pharmacological treatments . Similarly , different studies in rodent models show that n - 79 3 PUFA deficiency affects dopamine transmission and related behaviors 12 , 13 . In line with this 80 evidence , we recently reported a unique vulnerability of D2R - expressing neurons to PUFA 81 biostatus that directly accounts for the motivational deficits induced by n - 3 PUFA deficiency 14 . 82 Early experimental studies have reported that n - 3 PUFAs , namely docosahexaenoic acid 83 ( DHA , 22 : 6 ) , enhance the function of the prototypical A GPCR rhodopsin 15 – 17 . Subsequent 84 studies showed that DHA - containing phospholipids preferentially solvate rhodopsin 18 , 19 , which 85 could impact receptor function . In addition , recent in silico studies 20 , 21 demonstrate that the 86 D2R also displays a preference for DHA interaction that could modulate receptor partitioning 87 into specific membrane signaling platforms , as shown by early experiments 22 . While these 88 4 findings suggest that membrane PUFA composition could influence the activity of the D2R , 89 there is still no direct evidence of such an effect . 90 91 In this work , using both cell membrane extracts and model membranes , we found that DHA , 92 but not n - 6 PUFA docosapentaenoic acid ( DPA , 22 : 5 ) , enhances D2R ligand binding affinity . 93 Strikingly , while DPA and DHA only differ in one double bond , molecular dynamics ( MD ) 94 simulations show that they have a completely different propensity for interaction with the D2R . 95 Interestingly , membrane enrichment in either DHA or DPA have no effect on agonist - induced , 96 G i / o protein - dependent inhibition of cAMP production . However , both DHA and DPA similarly 97 enhance the maximal efficacy of the D2R to recruit β - arrestin2 upon agonist stimulation . 98 Finally , we provide in vivo evidence that DHA deficiency blunts the behavioral effects of D2R 99 ligands . Altogether , these data highlight the impact of membrane PUFA composition on D2R 100 activity and suggest that DHA acts as an allosteric modulator of the receptor . 101 102 Results 103 104 1 . Membrane n - 3 PUFAs , but not n - 6 PUFAs , modulate the binding affinity of D2R 105 ligands 106 To determine the impact of membrane lipid unsaturation on D2R ligand binding , HEK cells 107 were incubated with PUFAs , which is known to result in their esterification in sn - 2 position of 108 phospholipids 23 . We used two different PUFAs , the n - 3 PUFA DHA ( C22 : 6 ) and the n - 6 PUFA 109 DPA ( C22 : 5 ) , which display the same carbon chain length , but differ in one double bond . A 110 lipid analysis confirmed the enrichment of phospholipids in DHA or DPA and monitored its 111 efficient incorporation in cell membranes , leading to comparable proportion of either PUFA 112 after treatment ( increase of 19 % for DHA and 20 % for DPA ) ( Fig . S1 ) . We measured the 113 binding affinity of D2R ligands on supported cell membranes expressing the D2R using 114 plasmon waveguide resonance ( PWR ) spectroscopy 24 . The resonance position shifts were 115 followed in p - ( perpendicular to the sensor surface ) and s - polarisation ( parallel to the sensor 116 surface ) upon poly - L - Lysine ( PLL ) coating of the PWR sensor and subsequent cell membrane 117 adhesion and detachment ( Fig . S2A and B ) . The cell membrane fragment deposition led to 118 positive shifts similar to those observed for synthetic lipid bilayer formation 25 . We measured 119 the resonance shifts upon incremental addition of ligand when the time curve reached a 120 plateau ( Fig . S2C and D ) and led to shifts in the minimum resonance . These cumulative shifts 121 were plotted as a binding curve which allowed calculating a dissociation constant ( K D ) and 122 5 measuring a plateau of the resonance shifts ( Fig . S3 ) . The K D calculated for the agonist 123 quinpirole and the antagonist spiperone were comparable to the ones reported in the literature , 124 validating our system and confirming that the receptor maintains functionality in these 125 conditions ( Fig . S3C ) 26 , 27 . The results from these experiments show that membrane DHA 126 enrichment enhances ligand binding affinities for agonists ( quinpirole and dopamine ) , 127 antagonist ( spiperone ) , and partial agonist ( aripiprazole ) ( Fig . 1 ) . However , DPA slightly 128 decreased D2R binding affinity for quinpirole and spiperone ( Fig . 1A and E ) and had no effect 129 for dopamine and aripiprazole ( Fig . 1C and G ) . We further confirmed the potentiating effect of 130 membrane DHA enrichment on D2R ligand binding affinity for the spiperone - derived 131 fluorescent ligand NAPS - d2 through fluorescence anisotropy 28 , 29 ( Fig . S4 ) and in partially 132 purified D2R reconstituted in model membranes ( Fig . S5 ) . 133 134 To study ligand - induced receptor conformational changes , we quantified the direction and 135 magnitude of minimum resonance in p - and s - polarizations , which account for changes along 136 the receptor long and short axis , respectively . Resonance shifts obtained upon ligand addition 137 were positive in both polarisations for agonists ( quinpirole , dopamine ) and partial agonist 138 ( aripiprazole ) , and negative for the antagonist spiperone ( Fig . 1F ) . These results show that 139 different classes of ligands induce distinct conformational changes upon binding to the D2R , 140 as previously reported for other GPCRs 30 – 34 . While the presence of membrane PUFAs did not 141 significantly influence the changes in conformation induced by quinpirole and spiperone ( Fig . 142 1B and F ) , they impacted the conformation of dopamine - and aripiprazole - bound D2Rs 143 regarding the anisotropy of the conformational state that became less anisotropic for dopamine 144 and more anisotropic for aripiprazole ( as shown by the respective decrease and increase in p - 145 polarization shifts ; Figs . 1D and 1H ) . 146 147 6 148 Figure 1 .

MD simulations reveal that n - 3 and n - 6 PUFAs differentially interact with the 154 D2R 155 156 With the aim of gaining structural insights into the differential modulation exerted by DPA and 157 DHA in PUFA - enriched cell membranes , we used MD simulations to study the interaction 158 between the D2R and membranes enriched in either DHA or DPA . We first simulated four 159 replicas of the D2R embedded in a multicomponent membrane ( see Methods ) enriched in 160 either DHA - containing phospholipids ( 1 - stearoyl - 2 - docosahexaenoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - 161 phosphocholine , SD ( h ) PC ) or DPA - containing phospholipids ( 1 - stearoyl - 2 - 162 docosa ( p ) entaenoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine , SD ( p ) PC ) . In line with previous reports , 163 20 , 21 , SD ( h ) PC tends to displace saturated phospholipids from the membrane “solvation” shell 164 that surrounds the D2R , due to the much higher propensity of DHA tails for the interaction with 165 the receptor ( Fig . 2A ) . Strikingly , the loss of just one double bond ( i . e . replacing DHA by DPA ) 166 is enough to abolish this propensity , as shown by the much lower interaction ratio of SD ( p ) PC 167 molecules with the receptor during the simulation ( Fig . 2B ) . Specifically , the propensity for the 168 interaction with the D2R is three - fold higher for DHA tails ( Table 1 ) . 169 170 Ratio 0 - 250 ns 250 - 500 ns 500 – 750 ns 750 ns - 1 μs SD ( h ) PC sn - 1 0 . 97 1 . 69 2 . 95 2 . 42 SD ( h ) PC sn - 2 ( DHA ) 2 . 01 3 . 05 4 . 61 4 . 08 SD ( p ) PC sn - 1 1 . 49 1 . 48 1 . 48 1 . 63 SD ( p ) PC sn - 2 ( DPA ) 1 . 47 1 . 95 2 . 28 2 . 33 Table 1 . Evolution of lipid - protein contacts during MD simulations . The table shows the average 171 relative proportion of lipid - protein contacts at four stages of the simulation . Contact ratios represent the 172 number of atomic contacts between each SD ( h ) PC or SD ( p ) PC chain ( i . e . sn - 1 or sn - 2 ) and the D2R , 173 with respect to the number of contacts between saturated phospholipids ( i . e . DPPC , DSPC , and PSM ) 174 and the protein ( see Methods for more details ) . 175 176 From these results , it is reasonable to speculate that the more flexible lipid corona built around 177 the D2R in DHA - rich membranes could allow for greater dynamics within the receptor , which 178 could potentially enhance protein conformational selection during the ligand binding process . 179 This scenario would accord with our ligand binding experiments , where DHA - rich membranes 180 consistently induced lower K Ds , i . e . higher binding affinities , than DPA - rich membranes ( Fig . 181 1 ) . Moreover , our simulations show that despite DHA and DPA only differing in one double 182 bond , they display a different pattern of interaction with the receptor ( Fig . 2C ) . Some of these 183 differences could also impact ligand binding affinity at the D2R . For example , SD ( p ) PC lipid 184 molecules display a clear preference over SD ( h ) PC for interaction with the extracellular 185 segments of transmembrane helix ( TM ) 1 , TM2 , and TM7 , which are known to define entry 186 8 crevices for water and phospholipid headgroups into the binding pocket 35 ( Fig . 2C , bottom 187 left ) . 188 189 190 191 Figure 2 .

Specifically , figures depict the contact ratio of each 195 SD ( h ) PC or SD ( p ) PC chain versus all saturated lipids ( i . e .

The percentage of frames where SD ( h ) PC or 200 SD ( p ) PC lipid molecules contacted the D2R is depicted in a blue ( low ) to yellow ( high ) color gradient 201 mapped to the surface of the receptor . 202 203 We also simulated the D2R bound to dopamine or aripiprazole molecules , and embedded into 204 a multicomponent membrane enriched in SD ( h ) PC ( see Methods ) . Interestingly , while the 205 aripiprazole - bound D2R simulations also showed an increased level of DHA around the 206 receptor ( Fig . 2E ) , the DHA solvation effect was absent or even diminished in dopamine - bound 207 D2R simulations ( Fig . 2D ) . Specifically , the propensity for the interaction between DHA tails 208 and the protein was approximately two - fold higher in the aripiprazole - bound D2R simulations 209 ( Table 2 ) . 210 211 9 Ratio 0 - 250 ns 250 - 500 ns 500 - 750 ns 750 ns - 1 μs DOPA SD ( h ) PC sn - 1 1 . 16 0 . 98 1 . 00 0 . 81 SD ( h ) PC sn - 2 ( DHA ) 1 . 78 1 . 63 1 . 62 1 . 73 ARI SD ( p ) PC sn - 1 0 . 97 1 . 46 1 - 65 1 . 67 SD ( p ) PC sn - 2 ( DHA ) 1 . 75 2 . 87 3 . 12 3 . 07 Table 2 .

DPPC , 215 DSPC and PSM ) ( see Methods for exact membrane composition and details on the calculation of these 216 ratios ) . 217 218 Furthermore , as shown in Fig . 2F , the presence of the ligand in the binding pocket induced a 219 different pattern of interactions between SD ( h ) PC and the D2R , including a different interaction 220 signature at the extracellular segment of the receptor where ligand binds ( Fig . 2F , upper left 221 and right panels ) 222 223 3 . n - 3 and n - 6 PUFAs do not influence the D 2 R G  i / o - mediated signaling pathway but 224 enhance maximal recruitment of  - arrestin2 225 226 In order to evaluate the downstream effect of PUFAs , we performed dose - response 227 experiments where we probed the signaling efficacy of the D2R in the presence and absence 228 of PUFAs . First , we treated cells with 10 µM PUFAs ( Fig . S6 ) and measured the inhibition of 229 forskolin - induced cAMP production upon quinpirole , dopamine and aripiprazole binding as a 230 proxy for G i / o protein signaling . As shown in Fig . S7A and Table S1 , both control and PUFA - 231 rich cells display a similar agonist - dependent decrease in cAMP production , which suggests 232 that PUFAs do not modulate the G i / o protein signaling pathway . Next , we used the same 233 experimental conditions to study the G i / o protein - independent signaling pathway by measuring 234  - arrestin2 recruitment . In these experiments , while PUFAs did not affect the potency of  - 235 arrestin2 recruitment ( i . e . EC 50 ) , they either substantially ( aripiprazole ) or slightly ( quinpirole 236 and dopamine ) affected its efficacy ( i . e . E max ) ( Fig . S7C , S7D , S7E ) . To confirm this trend , we 237 treated cells with a higher amount of PUFAs ( i . e . 30 µM ) ( Fig . S6 ) and we did not observe any 238 impact of PUFAs enrichment on basal cAMP production ( Fig . S7B ) . We then performed dose - 239 response experiments upon ligand stimulation . Higher PUFA manipulations did not influence 240 cAMP production or the EC 50 for  - arrestin2 recruitment ( Figs . 3A , 3C , and 3E ) , but significantly 241 increased the E max of  - arrestin2 recruitment for all ligands in both DHA - and DPA - rich cells 242 ( Figs . 3B , 3D , and 3F ) . 243 10 Altogether , our data reveal that both DPA and DHA exert a similar effect on downstream 244 signaling , namely they do not affect G i / o protein activation but they are able to enhance  - 245 arrestin2 recruitment efficacy . 246 247 248 Figure 3 .

Using such an approach , we previously demonstrated that i ) n - 3 PUFA 263 11 deficiency leads to decreased and increased levels of DHA and DPA in membrane 264 phospholipids , respectively and ii ) n - 3 PUFA deficient animals display motivational deficits that 265 are due to impaired functionality of D2R - expressing neurons 14 . Herein , using striatal extracts 266 – in which D2R is highly expressed – we found that i ) Gi protein recruitment at the receptor 267 under quinpirole application is unaffected ( Fig . 4A ) and ii ) phosphorylation of the glycogen 268 synthase kinase  ( GSK3  ) , a key signaling enzyme downstream of  - arrestin2 36 , is 269 decreased at basal states in n - 3 PUFA deficient animals ( Fig . 4B and S8 ) . These latter findings 270 are consistent with our in vitro data showing that membrane PUFA enrichment potentiates the 271 recruitment of  - arrestin2 at the D2R . Next , we used n - 3 PUFA deficient animals to study 272 behavioral responses to D2R ligands . Our results show that n - 3 PUFA deficient animals display 273 decreased locomotor response under quinpirole administration ( Fig . 4C ) . Finally , we found that 274 peripheral administration of aripiprazole blunted performance in an operant conditioning - based 275 motivational task in control animals , while n - 3 PUFA deficient mice were partially insensitive 276 to aripiprazole ( Fig . 4D ) . 277 278 12 279 280 Figure 4 .

DHA ) and rhodopsin 15 – 19 , recent studies have confirmed that DHA can also 294 modulate the activity and function of other GPCRs including the cannabinoid CB1 receptor 37 , 295 the D2R 20 , 21 and the adenosine A2A receptor 20 , 21 , 38 . Here , we focus on D2R interplay with 296 PUFAs and show that ( a ) DHA - but not DPA - rich phospholipids potentiate the binding affinity 297 of both agonists and antagonists for the D2R ; ( b ) both DPA and DHA enhance  - arrestin2 298 recruitment efficacy without affecting G i / o protein activity ; and ( c ) n - 3 deficient animal models 299 display altered behavioral responses upon treatment with D2R ligands . 300 301 PUFA - containing phospholipids can have a strong influence on the physical and mechanical 302 properties of biological membranes including thickness , bending or rigidity 39 and , hence , 303 subtle changes in these properties can indirectly modulate the function of transmembrane 304 proteins 39 – 41 . Therefore , PUFA - rich membranes could potentially favor specific conformations 305 of the D2R to modulate its ligand binding affinity . In particular , n - 3 PUFAs provide 306 transmembrane proteins with a uniquely flexible environment that enables such modulation 41 – 307 43 . Interestingly , despite differing in just one double bond , n - 6 PUFAs do not seem to increase 308 membrane elasticity to the same extent 44 . Furthermore , by increasing membrane fluidity 309 and / or packing defects 8 , PUFAs could change D2R accessibility for ligands thus modulating 310 their affinity . In fact , most antipsychotics ( i . e . D2R ligands ) display high membrane partitioning 311 properties 45 , 46 . Of note , Lolicato et al . have recently shown that the entry pathway of dopamine 312 into the D2R likely requires this neurotransmitter to first partition into the membrane 47 . 313 314 On the other hand , different studies demonstrate that PUFAs tend to preferentially interact with 315 GPCRs 18 , 19 , 48 , 49 ; thus , changes in ligand binding affinity could also be the result of direct 316 interactions between PUFAs and the D2R . In the current study , MD simulations confirm that 317 DHA tails preferentially interact with the D2R when compared to saturated ones , as previously 318 reported 20 , 21 . Intriguingly , our simulations show that this preferential interaction is lower or 319 completely absent in the presence of aripiprazole or dopamine in the D2R binding pocket , 320 respectively . This result suggests a more complex scenario where the conformational state 321 induced by the ligand could also modulate the interaction propensity between the membrane 322 and the receptor , as recently suggested for cholesterol and the oxytocin receptor 50 . 323 Interestingly , our simulations also show that n - 6 PUFAs ( i . e . DPA ) have a much lower tendency 324 to interact with the receptor , despite DHA and DPA only differing in one double bond . While 325 further work is needed to unravel the precise molecular mechanisms behind the effect of DHA 326 on ligand binding affinity , our work suggests that DHA can act as an allosteric modulator of the 327 14 D2R , both by influencing the bulk membrane properties and by establishing direct interactions 328 with the receptor . 329 330 However , our dose - response experiments in cells show that the enhancing effect of PUFAs on 331 D2R ligand binding affinity does not correlate with an increased signal of relevant downstream 332 protein effectors . On the one hand , enriching membranes with PUFAs did not alter cAMP 333 production ( i . e . G i / o protein signaling ) . This result is in line with different early 51 , 52 and more 334 recent reports 53 . On the other hand , PUFA - rich membranes do enhance the maximal efficacy 335 of β - arrestin2 recruitment , which seems to support a mechanism in which these lipids modulate 336 specific protein effectors . This is compatible with the fact that PUFAs can alter the lateral 337 organization of membranes 23 , 54 – 56 or change the domain partitioning properties of GPCRs 338 including the D2R 20 , 21 . Changes in the properties of membrane microdomains could also affect 339 the affinity of palmitoyl moieties for these domains , which could in turn affect receptor 340 partitioning . As previously suggested 57 – 62 , altering receptor partitioning could indirectly 341 modulate receptor phosphorylation and , hence , influence β - arrestin coupling . It is also worth 342 speculating that PUFA - induced membrane packing defects 8 could alter β - arrestin recruitment 343 by modulating the membrane anchoring of C - edge loops 63 . Therefore , one plausible albeit 344 speculative hypothesis is that PUFAs could selectively modulate D2R signaling properties by 345 altering membrane lateral organization and / or influencing β - arrestin anchoring to the 346 membrane . It is worth noting that ( a ) the potency ( EC50 ) of β - arrestin recruitment does not 347 change , and ( b ) both DPA and DHA exert comparable effects on protein signaling whereas 348 only DHA is capable of enhancing ligand binding . Altogether , these data suggest that the 349 effects of PUFAs on D2R signaling are at least partially uncoupled from the changes in receptor 350 binding properties . However , it should be noted that the relatively small changes in ligand 351 binding affinity induced by PUFAs on ligand binding affinity might be difficult to detect using 352 signalling assays in heterologous system . Nonetheless , such subtle modifications might have 353 important physiological impact in the context of chronic alterations in PUFA levels , in particular 354 when occurring during brain development . 355 This hypothesis is supported by our in vivo findings in a model of chronic deficiency in n - 3 356 PUFAs 14 . In fact , in accordance with our in vitro results , while n - 3 PUFA deficiency does not 357 seem to affect D2R binding of the G i / o protein in the striatum , the decrease in phospho - GSK3 358 expression is consistent with an impairment of β - arrestin2 - dependent signaling , since GSK3 359 phosphorylation depends on β - arrestin2 recruitment at the D2R 36 . Notably , D2R - mediated 360 locomotor response has recently been shown to also depend on β - arrestin2 - , but not G i / o 361 protein - , mediated signalling 64 . In line with this , we find that D2R agonist ( quinpirole ) - induced 362 increase in locomotion is blunted in n - 3 PUFA deficient animals , consistent with an impairment 363 15 in β - arrestin2 recruitment and downstream signalling . Yet , however , we find that aripiprazole - 364 induced decrease in motivation – which might result from an antagonistic activity of aripiprazole 365 at the D2R - is also blunted in n - 3 PUFA deficient animals . D2R - mediated modulation of 366 motivation has been shown to be independent of β - arrestin2 - dependent signalling 64 , but rather 367 to rely on G i / o protein - mediated transmission at synaptic terminals in the ventral pallidum 65 . 368 This raises the intriguing hypothesis that membrane PUFAs could differentially modulate D2R 369 signalling activity depending on neuronal subcompartments . Even though further work will be 370 needed to disentangle the precise mechanisms by which PUFAs modulate D2R activity in vivo , 371 these latter data are in line with the recent demonstration that motivational deficits in n - 3 PUFA 372 deficient animals directly relates to a dysfunction of D2R - expressing neurons 14 . 373 374 Unveiling the precise mechanisms by which brain PUFA biostatus impacts D2R - dependent 375 signaling and downstream - related behaviors will require further work . Nonetheless , taken 376 together , our results show that n - 3 PUFAs could act as allosteric modulators of the D2R and 377 potentiate its signalling activity , in particular the β - arrestin2 component . This raises the 378 intriguing hypothesis that n - 3 PUFA supplementation could allow potentiating the efficacy of 379 D2R ligands , several of them being antipsychotics . In accordance with this idea , several clinical 380 trials have shown that n - 3 PUFA supplementation accelerates treatment response , improves 381 the tolerability of antipsychotics in first - episode psychoses 66 , 67 , and reduces prescription rate 382 of antipsychotics 68 . Our data suggest that direct action of PUFA membrane composition on 383 D2R activity could mediate such alleviating effects . 384 385 16 Supplementary figures 386 387 388 Figure S1 .

Louis , MO , USA ) PUFAs 472 ( Cis - 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 , 16 , 19 - DHA ( DocosaHexaenoic Acid , ref D2534 ) , DPA n - 6 ( DocosaPentanoic 473 Acid , ref 18566 ) stock solutions ( 30mM ) were prepared in absolute ethanol under N2 ( De 474 Smedt - Peyrusse et al . , 2008 ) . For anisotropy assays , LigandTag Lite D2 ( L0002RED ) receptor 475 red antagonist was purchased from Cisbio Bioassays . Quinpirole ( ref 1061 ) and Forskolin ( ref 476 1099 ) was from Tocris . 477 478 Cell culture and treatment 479 HEK 293 stably expressing the human D2R ( Flp - in T - rex 293 SF - D2sWT / FRTTO 293 ) were 480 used . Cells were maintained at 37°C under 5 % CO2 in the following culture medium : DMEM 481 ( Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ) Glutamax ( InVitroGen ) containing 10 % of heat 482 inactivated fetal bovine serum , 100UI / ml penicillin and 0 . 1mg / ml streptomycin and 483 supplemented with 100µg / ml Hygromycin ( InVitrogen ) , 15µg / ml Blasticidin ( Cayla Invivogen ) 484 and 1µg / ml Tetracycline ( Sigma Aldrich ) . Upon reaching 80 - 90 % confluence , in the same 485 culture medium , cells were treated with 10µM and 30 µM DHA or DPA or 0 . 03 % and 0 . 01 % 486 ethanol ( vehicle ) respectively as control for 24h . After treatment , cells were dissociated by 487 using an Enzyme - Free Cell Dissociation Solution ( S - 014 - B , Merck Millipore ) and washed twice 488 in wash buffer ( 50mM Tris - HCl , 50mM NaCl , 2mM EDTA , pH 7 . 5 at 20°C ) by centrifugation at 489 500 ˣ g for 8 min at 20°C . Cell pellets were used either for Western blot analyses or for 490 membrane preparation . 491 492 Membrane preparation 493 The cell pellets of HEK cells were resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , 1 mM 494 EDTA , pH 7 . 5 at 4°C ) supplemented with anti - protease inhibitor cocktail ( PIC ) ( P8340 , Sigma 495 Aldrich ) and incubated for 30 min in ice . The cell lysate was homogenized using a 10 ml glass - 496 Teflon homogenizer with 30 gentle strokes . The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 183 ˣ 497 g for 10 min at 4°C . The supernatant was collected and the residual pellet was washed twice 498 by centrifugation in successively in 5 and 2 . 5ml of lysis buffer . The resulting supernatants were 499 pooled and centrifuged at 48000 ˣ g for 30 min at 4°C . The pellet containing the membrane 500 proteins was resuspended in binding buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , 50 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA , 2 mM 501 CaCl ₂ , pH 7 . 5 at 4°C ) supplemented with PIC . Protein concentration was determined by using 502 26 Bicinchoninic Acid ( BCA ) protein assay ( Uptima , Montluçon , France ) and membranes were 503 diluted to 1µg / µl in the binding buffer . 504 505 Plasmon waveguide resonance ( PWR ) 506 PWR experiments were performed with a homemade instrument equipped with a He - Ne laser 535 at 632 nm whose light is linearly polarized at 45° , allowing acquisition of both p - ( light that is 536 parallel to the incident light ) and s - polarization ( light that is perpendicular to the incident light ) 537 data within a single angular scan . The technique has been described previously 30 , 69 . 538 Experiments were carried out at controlled room temperature , e . g . 23°C . The sensor consists 539 in a 90° angle prism whose hypotenuse is coated with a silver layer ( 50 nm ) and overcoated 540 with silica ( 460 nm ) and is in contact with the cell sample Teflon block , with an aperture of 541 approximately 3 mm diameter through which the lipid bilayer is formed . This is placed on a 542 rotating table mounted on a corresponding motion controller ( Newport , Motion controller XPS ; 543 ≤ 1 mdeg resolution ) . 544 545 Formation of a planar lipid bilayer on the PWR sensor 546 The method used to prepare the lipid bilayer is based on the procedure by Mueller and Rudin 547 70 to make black lipid membranes . The planar lipid bilayer is formed across the small aperture 548 ( ~ 3 mm ) in the Teflon PWR cell by fusing freshly sonicated small unilamellar vesicles ( SUV , 549 3mg / ml ) with the silica surface . SUVs were prepared by initially dissolving the appropriate 550 amount of phospholipids in chloroform , to obtain the desired final concentration . A lipid film 551 was then formed by removing the solvent using a stream of N 2 ( g ) followed by 3h vacuum . The 552 lipid film was dispersed in PBS and thoroughly vortexed to form multi - lamellar vesicles ( MLVs ) . 553 To form SUVs , the MLVs dispersion was sonicated 5 times during 10 minutes at 40Hz 554 frequency just before use . To ensure that a proper solid - supported lipid bilayer is formed , the 555 changes in the resonance minimum position ( resulting from changes in mass density , 556 anisotropy and thickness following film deposition ) for both polarizations are measured and 557 compared to values previously established to correspond to a lipid bilayer 25 . 558 559 Immobilisation of cell fragments on the PWR sensor 560 The protocol for adhesion of cell fragments on silica ( glass slides or PWR sensor ) was adapted 561 from reported work from Perez and collaborators 71 . Briefly , the silica surface was washed with 562 ethanol , cleaned and activated by Plasma cleaner for 2 min ( Diener , Bielefeld , Germany ) . The 563 27 silica surfaces were then incubated with a solution of poly - L - lysine ( PLL , 0 . 1 mg / mL ) for 40 564 minutes following wash with PBS buffer . Cells grown to less than 50 % confluence were washed 565 with PBS and covered with water to induce osmotic swelling of the cells . Immediately , the glass 566 coverslip of the sensor was placed directly on top of cells . Pressure was applied for about 2 567 min on the glass slide or prism to induce cell rupture and caption of cell fragments . Then they 568 were removed ripping off cell fragments containing specially the upper membrane . The glass 569 slide or sensor was washed with PBS to remove cell debris and kept with buffer to prevent 570 drying and loss of membrane protein activity . PWR measurements were performed right away . 571 The PWR cell sample ( volume capacity of 250 μL ) was placed in contact with the prism and 572 filled with PBS . 573 574 Reconstitution of the dopamine D2 receptor in the lipid bilayer 575 After lipid bilayer formation , detergent - solubilized D2 receptor was reconstituted in the lipid 576 bilayer by the detergent - dilution method . Briefly , the receptor was purified in a mixture of 577 dodecylmatoside and cholesteryl hemisuccinate ( DDM / CHS ) at concentrations that are about 578 10 fold over the critical micelle concentration ( cmc ) of DDM . Part of the detergent was then 579 removed from the sample by use of centricons ( Merck Millipore ) with a cutoff of 50 KDa . This 580 consisted in concentrating and reducing the initial volume of the solubilized protein by a factor 581 of 5 . The insertion of a small volume ( about 20  L ) of DDM / CHS / OG solubilized protein into 582 the PWR chamber , leads to drastic and quick drop in the detergent concentration . If the 583 detergent concentration drops below the cmc during this step , this results in immediate positive 584 PWR shifts for both p - and s - polarisations with small changes in the TIR angle . In order to 585 compare data among different experiments , data were normalized relative to the amount of 586 reconstituted protein in the membrane . 587 588 Ligand - induced receptor response 589 Both systems ( cell fragments and reconstituted protein in lipid model systems ) were tested for 590 their capacity to respond to ligand to check if the dopamine D2 receptor is active after cell 591 fragment immobilisation or reconstitution process and if it was properly reconstituted in the 592 lipid membrane . Briefly , the method consisted in incrementally adding a specific dopamine D2 593 ligand to the cell and monitor the PWR spectral changes . The first concentration point was 594 chosen to be approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than the published dissociation 595 constant ( K D ) value for that ligand . Before each incremental concentration of ligand added , the 596 system was left to equilibrate . K D values were obtained from plotting the resonance minimum 597 28 position of the PWR spectra ( this reflects the receptor - ligand complex ) as a function of total 598 ligand concentration and fitting to the hyperbolic function that describes the 1 : 1 binding of a 599 ligand to a receptor using GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software ) . 600 A control experiment was performed that consisted in adding the same ligand concentrations 601 to a lipid bilayer with no receptor reconstituted . This measured non - specific binding of ligand 602 to lipids alone ( data not shown ) . 603 Fluorescence anisotropy assay 604 Fluorescence anisotropy ( FA ) was used to measure receptor - ligand binding reaction into 605 individual wells of black , 96 - well Greiner Bio - One microplates in a final volume of 100µl . To 606 establish a saturation binding curve , the range of protein membrane concentration used was 607 from 1 to 25µg in the presence of 10nM of the antagonist NAPS - d2 ligand ( L0002 red , Cisbio 608 Bioassays ) . The FA was measured on a Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro microplate reader 609 ( Männedorf , Switzerland ) . Excitation was set at 590 ± 5 nm and emission was collected at 665 610 ± 5 nm bandpass filters for the Texas Red . 611 The non - specific binding was obtained from membranes that did not express the receptor and 612 the total binding was measured with D2R - expressing membranes . The non - specific binding 613 curve was fitted with a Simple - linear regression in GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software , San 614 Diego , CA ) , the total binding curve was fitted with a One site – total binding curve in GraphPad 615 Prism . The specific binding was determined by subtracting the non - specific curve to the total 616 binding curve and the final specific binding curve was fitted with a One site – specific binding 617 model in GraphPad Prism . The latter was used to determine relative K D values via separated 618 saturation binding curves in at least three independent experiments and are reported as mean 619 ± SEM . 620 621 cAMP accumulation assays 622 D2R stably expressing HEK 293 cells were grown on PLL treated 12 - well plates as described 623 above . Upon reaching 80 - 90 % confluence , cells were treated with 10 µM or 30 µM DHA or 624 DPA n - 6 or 0 . 03 % to 0 . 1 % ethanol ( vehicle ) as control for 24 h in the culture medium . The 625 medium was removed and cells were rinsed in DMEM before pretreatment with 1mM 626 IsoButylMethylXanthine ( IBMX , Sigma I5879 ) for 15min . Cells were then stimulated for 30min 627 with the indicated concentrations of agonists Quinpirole ( Tocris 1061 ) , Dopamine ( Sigma 628 H8502 ) and Aripiprazole ( Sigma SML0935 ) in the presence of 1mM IBMX and 10µM Forskolin 629 ( Tocris 1099 ) . Endogenous phosphodiesterase activity was stopped by removing the medium 630 and the addition of 0 . 1M HCL ( 300µl / well ) . After centrifugation at 600g during 10min , protein 631 concentration of supernatants was quantified by BCA . Cyclic AMP levels were determined in 632 29 samples containing 10µg of protein . The production of cAMP was measured by using a cAMP 633 Enzyme Immunoassay kit ( Sigma , CA200 ) as described by the manufacturer using Victor3 634 ( Perkin Elmer ) plate reader . The curve fit was obtained by GraphPad Prism 5 ( GraphPad 635 Software , Inc . ) . 636 637 β - Arrestin2 recruitment assay 638 β - arrestin2 recruitment was assessed using the PathHunter © express DRD2L CHO - K1 Beta 639 arrestin GCPR Assay ( DiscoverX , Fremont , CA ) . In brief , cells were plated into 96 - well white - 640 walled assay plates in a volume of 90µl of Cell Plating Reagent ( DiscoverX ) . They were 641 incubated 24 h at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 . The next day , PUFAs ( Ethanol 0 . 01 % as control vehicle , 642 DHA , and DPA n - 6 ) were prepared at 10X concentration ( 300µM ) in Cell Plating Reagent and 643 10 μL was added to the cells for 24h at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 . Serial dilutions ( 11x ) ranging from 154 644 to 0 . 0026 µM , 281 to 0 . 0046 µM and 9 . 35 to 0 . 000157 µM , of Quinpirole , Dopamine and 645 Aripiprazole respectively , were prepared and 10 µl of each concentration was added for 90 646 minutes . Luminescence was measured at 1 h post PathHunter © detection reagent addition 647 using Victor3 plate reader ( Perkin Elmer 0 . 5 - s / well integration time ) . Data were normalized to 648 control treated with the highest concentration of ligand ( 100 % ) . This control value corresponds 649 to Top best fit value determined by non - linear fit of standard slope . Data were fitted to a three - 650 parameter logistic curve to generate EC 50 and E max values ( Prism , version 5 . 0 , GraphPad 651 Software , Inc . , San Diego , CA ) . EC 50 and % E max values are the result of three independent 652 experiments performed in duplicate . 653 Animals and experimental model 654 Mice were housed in groups of 5 - 10 animals in standard polypropylene cages and maintained 655 in a temperature and humidity - controlled facility under a 12 : 12 light - dark cycle ( 8 : 00 on ) with 656 ad libitum access to water and food . All animal care and experimental procedures were in 657 accordance with the INRA Quality Reference System and to french legislations ( Directive 658 87 / 148 , Ministère de l’Agriculture et de la Pêche ) and European ( Directive 86 / 609 / EEC ) . They 659 followed ethical protocols approved by the Region Aquitaine Veterinary Services ( Direction 660 Départementale de la Protection des Animaux , approval ID : B33 - 063 - 920 ) and by the animal 661 ethic committee of Bordeaux CEEA50 . Every effort was made to minimize suffering and reduce 662 the number of animals used . C57BL / 6J mouse lines from Janvier Laboratories ( Robert Janvier , 663 Le Genest St - Isle France ) were used in this study . Female C57BL6 / J mice were fed with 664 isocaloric diets containing 5 % fat with a high ( n - 3 def diet ) or low LA / ALA ratio ( Ctrl diet ) across 665 30 gestation and lactation and offspring were maintained under the same diet after weaning as 666 previously done ( see details in 14 ) . All experiments were performed at adulthood . 667 Operant conditioning 668 The apparatus used for these experiments was previously described 14 . Animals were food - 669 restricted in order to maintain them at 85 - 90 % of their ad libitum weight and exposed to one 670 session ( 1 hour ) each day , 5 - 7 days per week . A pavlovian training followed by fixed and 671 random ratio training were performed in order to make the animals reach an acquisition 672 criterion ( i . e . the number of lever presses and rewards earned ) before performing the 673 motivational task per se as previously described 14 . In the motivational task , namely the 674 progressive ratio times 2 ( PRx2 ) schedule , the number of lever presses required to earn a 675 reward was doubled respective to the previous one obtained . Mice were tested multiple times 676 in PRx2 with RR20 sessions intercalated between each PR tasks . Aripiprazole ( Arip ; 7 - [ 4 - [ 4 - 677 ( 2 , 3 - dichlorophenyl ) piperazin - 1 - yl ] butoxy ] - 3 , 4 - dihydro - 1H - quinolin - 2 - one ; Merck® , 678 Darmstadt , Germany ) was dissolved in a mixture of saline ( NaCl 0 . 9 % ) and cremiphore ( 2 % 679 of cremiphore in saline ) at the doses of 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 mg / kg and administered intraperitoneally 680 10 min before the beginning of the PRx2 test sessions as previously done ( Ducrocq et al . , in 681 prep . ) . The ratio of lever presses under drugs over lever presses after vehicle injection were 682 measured for each animal and averaged in order to evaluate the effect of the drugs on operant 683 responding . 684 Spontaneous locomotion 685 Animals were transferred individually to small Plexiglas cages ( 10 cm wide , 20 cm deep , 12 686 cm tall ) equipped with a video tracking system ( Smart , Panlab , Barcelona , Spain ) allowing the 687 recording of total distance travelled ( cm ) as a measure of spontaneous locomotor activity in 688 basal condition for one hour . Quinpirole - induced locomotor response was evaluated as 689 described previously ( Akhisaroglu et al . , 2005 ) . Briefly , animals received 7 intraperitoneal 690 injection of 1mg / kg quinpirole ( Quin ; Tocris ) dissolved in 0 . 9 % saline every 72 hours . 691 Locomotion was immediately measured for 3 hours after the 8th injection of 0 . 5mg / kg Quin . 692 Western blot 693 Mice were dislocated and the brains were quickly removed , snap - frozen on dry ice and stored . 694 Nucleus accumbens samples were punched ( No . 18035 - 01 , Fine Science Tools ) from 200 µm 695 frozen slices in a cryostat . Samples were homogenized and denatured and western blot were 696 performed as previously described 14 . Briefly , equal quantities of proteins ( 10μg / well ) were 697 31 separated by electrophoresis . Membranes were saturated and blots were probed with the 698 following primary antibodies : 1 : 700 rabbit anti - βArr2 ( Cell signaling Cat . No . 3857 ) ; 1 : 1000 699 rabbit anti - GSK3β ( Cell signaling Cat . No . 12456 ) ; 1 : 1000 rabbit anti - P - GSK3β ( Cell signaling 700 Cat . No . 5558 ) ; 1 : 10000 mouse anti - tubulin ( Merck Cat . No . T5168 ) . Then , membranes were 701 incubated with the secondary antibody coupled to Horse Radish Peroxidase ( HRP , 1 / 5000 , 702 Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . After revelation , optical density capture of the signal was 703 performed with the ChemidocMP imaging system ( BioRad ) and intensity of the signal was 704 quantified using the Image Lab software ( BioRad ) . 705 Cell Membrane Microarray and [ 35 S ] GTPγS autoradiography 706 Microarrays were composed of a collection of membrane homogenates isolated from the NAc 707 of adult mice exposed to Ctrl diet ( n = 17 ) or n - 3 def diet ( n = 17 ) and from rat cerebral cortex as 708 positive control . Briefly , tissue samples were homogenized using a Teflon - glass grinder 709 ( Heidolph RZR 2020 ) and a disperser ( Ultra - Turrax® T10 basic , IKA ) in 20 volumes of 710 homogenized buffer ( 1 mM EGTA , 3 mM MgCl2 , and 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 ) supplemented 711 with 250 mM sucrose . The crude homogenate was subjected to a 3 , 000 rpm centrifugation 712 ( AllegraTM X 22R centrifuge , Beckman Coulter ) for 5 min at 4°C , and the resultant supernatant 713 was centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm ( Microfuge® 22R centrifuge , Beckman Coulter ) for 15 min ( 4 714 °C ) . The pellet was washed in 20 volumes of homogenized buffer and re - centrifuged under the 715 same conditions . The homogenate aliquots were stored at - 80 °C until they were used . Protein 716 concentration was measured by the Bradford method and adjusted to the required 717 concentrations . Microarrays were fabricated by a non - contact microarrayer ( Nano _ plotter 718 NP2 . 1 ) placing the cell membrane homogenates ( 20 drops / spot ) into microscope glass slides 719 treated using a proprietary technology , which enables the immobilization of cell membranes to 720 supports preserving the structure and functionality of their proteins 72 . 721 [ 35 S ] GTPγS binding studies were carried out using Cell Membrane Microarrays according to 722 the following protocol . Briefly , Cell Membrane Microarrays were dried 20 min at room 723 temperature ( r . t . ) , then they were incubated in assay buffer ( 50 mM Tris - Cl ; 1 mM EGTA ; 3 724 mM MgCl 2 ; 100 mM NaCl ; 0 , 5 % BSA ; pH 7 , 4 ) in the presence or absence of 50 µM GDP 725 and / or 100 µM quinpirole for 15 min at r . t . . Microarrays were transferred into assay buffer 726 containing 50 µM GDP and 0 . 1 nM [ 35 S ] GTPγS , with and without the dopamine D2 agonist , 727 quinpirole , at 100 µM and incubated at 30°C for 30 min . Non - specific binding was determined 728 with GTPγS ( 10 µM ) . Finally , microarrays , together with [ 35 S ] - standards , were exposed to films , 729 developed , scanned and quantified using the Mapix software . 730 Lipid analyses 731 32 Cells submitted to different treatments were randomly analyzed according to Joffre et al . 73 . 732 Total lipids were extracted according to the method developed by Folch et al . 74 and were 733 submitted to fatty acid methylation using 7 % boron trifluoride in methanol following Morrison 734 and Smith protocol 75 . Gas chromatography on a HewlettPackard Model 5890 gas 735 chromatograph ( Palo Alto , CA , USA ) was employed to analyze fatty acid methylesters 736 ( FAMEs ) using aCPSIL - 88 column ( 100 m×0 . 25 mm internal diameter ; film thickness , 0 . 20 μm ; 737 Varian , Les Ulis , France ) . Hydrogen was used as a carrier gas ( inlet pressure , 210 kPa ) . The 738 oven temperature was maintained at 60 °C for 5 min , then increased to 165 °C at 15 °C / min 739 and held for 1 min , and then to 225 °C at 2 °C / min and finally held at 225 °C for 17 min . The 740 injector and the detector were maintained at 250 °C and 280 °C , respectively . FAMEs were 741 identified by comparison with commercial and synthetic standards and the data were computed 742 using the Galaxie software ( Varian ) . The proportion of each fatty acid was expressed as a 743 percentage of total fatty acids to allow the comparison of lipid composition in different cell 744 culture conditions . 745 MD simulations 746 VMD1 . 9 . 4 76 was used to preprocess both inactive crystal ( PDB ID : 6CM4 ) and active cryoEM 747 structures ( PDB ID : 6VMS ) of the dopamine D2 to set up the simulations of the apo and holo 748 states , respectively . Any co - crystallization atoms different than water molecules closer than 5 749 Å to the protein were removed . MODELLER 77 was used to : ( a ) mutate back to the native 750 sequence any mutation present in the structure , namely A122I , A375L , and A379L in PDB ID : 751 6CM4 , and I205T , L222R , L374M , Y378V , L381V , and I421V in PDB ID : 6VMS , and ( b ) model 752 residue CYS443 , which is missing in the 6CM4 structure , to have the D2R palmitoylation site 753 available . The HomolWat server 78 was used to place internal water molecules not present in 754 the initial structure , and the sodium ion in the case of apo structures . An inactive apo structure 755 was then generated by simply removing the risperidone ligand bound to PDB ID : 6CM4 . 756 Likewise , an active apo structure was generated by removing the ligand bromoergocryptine 757 from PDB ID : 6VMS . This second apo structure was used to dock one molecule of either 758 dopamine or aripiprazole into the orthosteric binding pocket of the receptor using AutoDock 759 Vina 79 . 760 The CHARMM - GUI builder 80 , 81 was used to embed each refined structure were into a 90 x 90 761 Å 2 multicomponent membrane rich in either DHA or DPA , using a specific and realistic lipid 762 composition 20 , which is detailed in Table S2 . 763 Each protein - membrane system was placed into a water box made of explicit water molecules , 764 their charge was neutralized , and the ionic strength of the system adjusted , throughout 765 33 CHARMM - GUI builder’s pipeline . All titratable residues of the protein were left in their dominant 766 protonation state at pH 7 . 0 , except for Asp80 . Disulfide bridges were inserted between Cys107 - 767 Cys182 , and Cys399 - Cys401 , and a palmitoyl moiety was covalently linked to Cys443 . 768 Systems were first energy minimized and then equilibrated for 50 ns at constant pressure ( NPT 769 ensemble ) . The harmonic positional restraints initially applied to all Cα atoms of the protein 770 were gradually released throughout the equilibration phase . Production simulations for each 771 replica were run for 1 µs each , at constant volume ( NVT ensemble ) , 1 , 013 bar and 310 K . The 772 production simulations of this study yielded an aggregated time of 16 µs ( 4 systems x 4 replicas 773 x 1 µs ) . All simulations were run using ACEMD 82 in combination with the CHARMM36m force 774 field 83 . Dopamine and aripiprazole ligand charges were optimized in the ANI - 2x mode using 775 the parameterize module of HTMD 84 . Figures from simulations were rendered using the 776 Tachyon renderer 85 and the R ggplot2 library 86 . 777 Lipid - protein contact ratios between lipid species were calculated by dividing the number of 778 contacts per atom of one lipid group over the other . Atoms closer than 4 . 2 Å to the centre of 779 mass of the protein were considered in contact . Only lipid tail atoms were used in these 780 calculations . Each contact value was previously normalized by the total number of atoms in 781 that particular selection . For example , sn - 1 SDP ( d ) C / SAT ratios were calculated as the 782 number of atoms of DHA < 4 . 2 Å of protein’s centre of mass divided by the total number of 783 SDP ( d ) C chain atoms in the system . Likewise , SAT is calculated in the former ratio as the 784 number of atoms of any DPPC , DSPC , or PSM chain closer than 4 . 2 Å of protein’s centre of 785 mass divided by the total number atoms of these tails . 786 The average lipid occupancy across the simulations was computed using the Python package 787 PyLipID 87 . 788 Statistical analyses 789 Data are reported as mean ± SEM . Statistical analyses were conducted using Prism 6 software 790 ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . Two - tailed unpaired Student’s t - test or Mann 791 Whitney test were used to assess differences between two groups . Two - way RM ANOVA 792 followed by post - hoc Bonferroni tests were used for repeated measures . Differences were 793 considered significant for p < 0 . 05 . 794 795 34 References 796 1 .
