Introduction Scalable sequence prediction models ( Graves , 2014 ; Vaswani et al . , 2017 ; Child et al . , 2019 ) have become a general - purpose method for generation and representation learning in many domains , including natural language pro - cessing ( Mikolov et al . , 2013 ; Sutskever et al . , 2014 ; Dai & Le , 2015 ; Peters et al . , 2018 ; Radford et al . , 2018 ; Devlin et al . , 2018 ) , computer vision ( Van Oord et al . , 2016 ; Menick & Kalchbrenner , 2018 ; Chen et al . , 2020 ; Bao et al . , 2021 ) , audio and speech processing ( Oord et al . , 2016 ; 2018 ; Dhari - wal et al . , 2020 ; Baevski et al . , 2020 ) , biology ( Alley et al . , 2019 ; Rives et al . , 2021 ) , and even across multiple modali - ties ( Das et al . , 2017 ; Lu et al . , 2019 ; Ramesh et al . , 2021 ; Zellers et al . , 2021 ) . More recently , language models have also fueled progress towards the longstanding challenge of program synthesis ( Simon , 1963 ; Manna & Waldinger , 1971 ) , spurred by the presence of code in large datasets ( Husain et al . , 2019 ; Gao et al . , 2020 ) and the resulting pro - gramming capabilities of language models trained on these datasets ( Wang & Komatsuzaki , 2021 ) . Popular language modeling objectives like masked language modeling ( Devlin et al . , 2018 ) and span prediction ( Raffel et al . , 2020 ) have also been adapted to train their programming counterparts CodeBERT ( Feng et al . , 2020 ) and PyMT5 ( Clement et al . , 2020 ) . Similarly , our early investigation of GPT - 3 ( Brown et al . , 2020 ) revealed that it could generate simple programs from Python docstrings . While rudimentary , this capability was exciting because GPT - 3 was not explicitly trained for code generation . Given the considerable success of large lan - guage models in other modalities and the abundance of publicly available code , we hypothesized that a specialized GPT model , called Codex , could excel at a variety of coding tasks . This paper describes several early Codex models , whose descendants power GitHub Copilot and the Codex models in the OpenAI API . a r X i v : 2107 . 03374v2 [ c s . L G ] 14 J u l 2021 Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code Figure 1 . Pass rates of our models on the HumanEval dataset as a function of model size . When a single sample is generated for each problem , GPT - 12B solves no problems , but Codex ( ﬁne - tuned on code ) solves 28 . 8 % of the problems , and Codex - S ( further ﬁne - tuned on correctly implemented standalone functions ) solves 37 . 7 % of the problems . From here , further gains can be realized by generating 100 samples per problem and selecting the sample with the highest mean log - probability ( 44 . 5 % solved ) or by selecting the sample that passes the unit tests ( 77 . 5 % solved ) . All samples are generated with temperature 0 . 8 . In this work , we focus on the task of generating stan - dalone Python functions from docstrings , and evaluate the correctness of code samples automatically through unit tests . This is in contrast to natural language generation , where samples are typically evaluated by heuristics or by human evaluators . To accurately benchmark our model , we create a dataset of 164 original programming problems with unit tests . These problems assess language compre - hension , algorithms , and simple mathematics , with some comparable to simple software interview questions . We release this data along with an evaluation framework at https : / / www . github . com / openai / human - eval . To solve a problem in our test set , we generate multiple samples from the models , and check if any of them pass the unit tests . With just a single sample , a 12B parameter Codex solves 28 . 8 % of these problems , and a 300M parameter Codex solves 13 . 2 % of these problems . In contrast , the 6B parameter GPT - J ( Wang & Komatsuzaki , 2021 ) achieves 11 . 4 % on the same dataset , while all GPT models achieve near 0 % . To improve our model’s performance at the task of function synthesis from docstrings , we ﬁne - tune Codex on standalone , correctly implemented functions . The resulting model , Codex - S , solves 37 . 7 % of problems with a single sample . Figure 2 showcases problems of varying difﬁculty in our dataset , along with correct model generated solutions . Real - world programming tasks often involve iterations of approaches and bug ﬁxes , which is approximated by gener - ating many samples from our models and selecting one that passes all unit tests . Within 100 samples , Codex - S is able to generate at least one correct function for 77 . 5 % of the prob - lems . This result suggests that accurate code samples can be selected via heuristic ranking instead of fully evaluating each sample , the latter of which may not be possible or prac - tical in deployment . Indeed , we ﬁnd that the sample with highest mean log - probability passes unit tests for 44 . 5 % of the problems . We conclude by discussing the limitations and potential broader impacts of these Codex models and of increasingly powerful code generating models more generally . 2 . Evaluation Framework In this section , we discuss the details of our evaluation framework . We begin by deﬁning the pass @ k metric , and explain its advantages over standard match - based metrics . Next , we describe the dataset of hand - written problems , called “HumanEval , ” which we created in order to bench - mark our models . Finally , we discuss the sandbox environ - ment we used to safely execute model - generated code . 2 . 1 . Functional Correctness Generative models for code are predominantly benchmarked by matching samples against a reference solution , where the match can be exact or fuzzy ( as in BLEU score ) . How - ever , recent work has surfaced deﬁciencies in match - based metrics for code . For instance , Ren et al . ( 2020 ) ﬁnds that BLEU has problems capturing semantic features speciﬁc to code , and suggests several semantic modiﬁcations to the score . More fundamentally , match - based metrics are unable to ac - count for the large and complex space of programs function - ally equivalent to a reference solution . As a consequence , recent works in unsupervised code translation ( Lachaux et al . , 2020 ) and pseudocode - to - code translation ( Kulal et al . , 2019 ) have turned to functional correctness instead , where a sample is considered correct if it passes a set of unit tests . We argue that this metric should be applied to docstring - conditional code generation as well . Perhaps the most convincing reason to evaluate functional correctness is that it is used by human developers to judge code . A framework known as test - driven development dic - tates that software requirements be converted into test cases before any implementation begins , and success is deﬁned by a program that passes these tests . While few organiza - tions employ full test - driven development , integration of new code is usually dependent on creating and passing unit tests . Kulal et al . ( 2019 ) evaluate functional correctness using the pass @ k metric , where k code samples are generated per problem , a problem is considered solved if any sample Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code Figure 2 . Three example problems from the HumanEval dataset , where the probabilities that a single sample from Codex - 12B passes unit tests are 0 . 9 , 0 . 17 , and 0 . 005 . The prompt provided to the model is shown with a white background , and a successful model - generated completion is shown in a yellow background . Though not a guarantee for problem novelty , all problems were hand - written and not programmatically copied from existing sources . Random problems and samples can be found in Appendix B . passes the unit tests , and the total fraction of problems solved is reported . However , computing pass @ k in this way can have high variance . Instead , to evaluate pass @ k , we generate n ≥ k samples per task ( in this paper , we use n = 200 and k ≤ 100 ) , count the number of correct samples c ≤ n which pass unit tests , and calculate the unbiased estimator pass @ k : = E Problems (cid:34) 1 − (cid:0) n − c k (cid:1) (cid:0) nk (cid:1) (cid:35) ( 1 ) Calculating this estimator directly results in very large num - bers and numerical instability . In Figure 3 , we include a numerically stable numpy implementation that simpliﬁes the expression and evaluates the product term - by - term . One may be tempted to estimate pass @ k with 1 − ( 1 − ˆ p ) k where ˆ p is the empirical estimate of pass @ 1 , but we show that it is biased in Appendix A . def pass _ at _ k ( n , c , k ) : " " " : param n : total number of samples : param c : number of correct samples : param k : k in pass @ $ k $ " " " if n - c < k : return 1 . 0 return 1 . 0 - np . prod ( 1 . 0 - k / np . arange ( n - c + 1 , n + 1 ) ) Figure 3 . A numerically stable script for calculating an unbiased estimate of pass @ k . Later , we provide evidence that BLEU score may not be a reliable indicator of functional correctness by showing that functionally inequivalent programs generated by our model ( which are guaranteed to disagree with the reference solution on some input ) often have higher BLEU scores than functionally equivalent ones . Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code 2 . 2 . HumanEval : Hand - Written Evaluation Set We evaluate functional correctness on a set of 164 hand - written programming problems , which we call the Hu - manEval dataset . Each problem includes a function sig - nature , docstring , body , and several unit tests , with an av - erage of 7 . 7 tests per problem . It is important for these tasks to be hand - written , since our models are trained on a large fraction of GitHub , which already contains solutions to problems from a variety of sources . For example , there are more than ten public repositories containing solutions to Codeforces problems , which make up part of the recently proposed APPS dataset ( Hendrycks et al . , 2021 ) . Programming tasks in the HumanEval dataset assess lan - guage comprehension , reasoning , algorithms , and simple mathematics . We release the HumanEval dataset so that others can evaluate functional correctness and measure the problem - solving capabilities of their models . The dataset can be found at https : / / www . github . com / openai / human - eval . 2 . 3 . Sandbox for Executing Generated Programs Since publicly available programs have unknown intent and generated programs are often incorrect , executing these programs poses a security risk . Indeed , GitHub is known to contain malicious programs that alter or change their environments ( Rokon et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , we developed a sandbox environment to safely run untrusted programs against unit tests . Our goals were to prevent these programs from modifying , gaining persistence on , accessing sensitive resources on , or exﬁltrating data from a host or network . Since OpenAI’s training infrastructure is built on Kubernetes and cloud services , we designed our sandbox to address the limitations of these environments while remaining idiomatic with their patterns of use . We selected the gVisor container runtime ( Lacasse , 2018 ) as the main host protection component . Since container runtimes like Docker can share host resources with contain - ers , a malicious container could potentially compromise a host . gVisor protects the host by emulating its resources to introduce a security boundary between the host and its con - tainers . Network - adjacent hosts and services are protected by eBPF - based ﬁrewall rules that prevent inbound and out - bound connections except for those required for experiment control . 3 . Code Fine - Tuning We ﬁne - tune GPT models containing up to 12B parameters on code to produce Codex . In contrast with GPT , Codex displays non - trivial performance on the HumanEval dataset . In fact , Codex is able to solve the majority of the problems in HumanEval if we generate and evaluate 100 samples per problem , and pick one that passes unit tests . When limited to a budget of one evaluation per problem , producing multiple samples with Codex and choosing the one with the highest mean log - probability provides signiﬁcant gains . 3 . 1 . Data Collection Our training dataset was collected in May 2020 from 54 mil - lion public software repositories hosted on GitHub , contain - ing 179 GB of unique Python ﬁles under 1 MB . We ﬁltered out ﬁles which were likely auto - generated , had average line length greater than 100 , had maximum line length greater than 1000 , or contained a small percentage of alphanumeric characters . After ﬁltering , our ﬁnal dataset totaled 159 GB . 3 . 2 . Methods Since Codex is evaluated on natural language prompts , we hypothesized that it would be beneﬁcial to ﬁne - tune from the GPT - 3 ( Brown et al . , 2020 ) model family , which already contains strong natural language representations . Surpris - ingly , we did not observe improvements when starting from a pre - trained language model , possibly because the ﬁne - tuning dataset is so large . Nevertheless , models ﬁne - tuned from GPT converge more quickly , so we apply this strategy for all subsequent experiments . We train Codex using the same learning rate as the corre - sponding GPT model , with a 175 step linear warmup and cosine learning rate decay . We train for a total of 100 billion tokens , using the Adam optimizer with β 1 = 0 . 9 , β 2 = 0 . 95 , (cid:15) = 10 − 8 , and a weight decay coefﬁcient of 0 . 1 . In order to maximally leverage text representations from GPT , we base our code lexer on the GPT - 3 text tokenizer . Since the distribution of words in GitHub code differs from that of natural text , this tokenizer is not very effective for representing code . The largest source of inefﬁciency arises from encoding whitespace , so we add an additional set of tokens for representing whitespace runs of different lengths . This allows us to represent code using approximately 30 % fewer tokens . To compute pass @ k , we assemble each HumanEval prob - lem into a prompt consisting of a header , a signature , and a docstring , which is illustrated in Figure 2 . We sample tokens from Codex until we encounter one of the following stop sequences : ‘ \ nclass ’ , ‘ \ ndef ’ , ‘ \ n # ’ , ‘ \ nif ’ , or ‘ \ nprint ’ , since the model will continue generating addi - tional functions or statements otherwise . We use nucleus sampling ( Holtzman et al . , 2020 ) with top p = 0 . 95 for all sampling evaluation in this work . 3 . 3 . Results In Figure 4 , we plot test loss on a held - out validation set against Codex model size . We ﬁnd that just as language Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code Figure 4 . Model cross - entropy test loss measured on a held - out split of our Python GitHub code corpus . The smooth power law scaling of performance with model size observed in GPT - 3 appears to hold even after code ﬁne - tuning . model test loss follows a power law in model size ( Kaplan et al . , 2020 ) , test loss after code ﬁne - tuning follows a similar power law with functional form ( N 5 . 92 × 10 7 ) − 0 . 13 where N is the number of non - embedding parameters in the model . When evaluating pass @ k , it is important to optimize sam - pling temperature for the particular value of k . In Figure 5 , we plot pass @ k against the number of samples k and the sampling temperature . We ﬁnd that higher temperatures are optimal for larger k , because the resulting set of samples has higher diversity , and the metric rewards only whether the model generates any correct solution . In particular , for a 679M parameter model , the optimal tem - perature for pass @ 1 is T ∗ = 0 . 2 and the optimal tempera - ture for pass @ 100 is T ∗ = 0 . 8 . With these temperatures , we ﬁnd that pass @ 1 and pass @ 100 scale smoothly as a function of model size ( Figure 6 ) . Pass @ k can also be interpreted as the result of evaluating the best out of k samples , where the best sample is picked by an oracle with prior knowledge of the unit tests . From a practical perspective , we are also interested in the set - ting where we must select a single sample from k samples without having access to an oracle . For instance , when the model is used as an autocomplete tool where a user provides a prompt , we do not have unit tests , but would like to return only a single completion to the user for evaluation so as to not overwhelm them . Inspired by similar work in language modeling , we ﬁnd that choosing the sample with the highest mean token log probability outperforms evaluating a random sample , while choosing the sample based on sum log probability can per - form slightly worse than picking randomly . Figure 7 demon - strates the beneﬁts of applying these heuristics to samples ( at temperature 0 . 8 ) from Codex - 12B . Figure 5 . In the top panel , we plot pass @ k against the number of samples ( k ) for various temperature settings . Higher temperatures are better when the number of samples is large , likely due to the increased sample diversity . In the bottom panel , we plot the best temperature setting for each k , obtained by taking the upper hull of the top panel . Figure 6 . Using the optimal temperatures 0 . 2 and 0 . 8 for pass @ 1 and pass @ 100 , we plot these two metrics as a function of model size . Performance appears to scale smoothly as a sigmoid in log - parameters . Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code Figure 7 . Model performance in the setting where we can generate multiple samples , but only evaluate one . We can do better than ran - domly selecting a sample by choosing the solution with the highest mean log - probability ( red ) or with the highest back - translation score ( orange ) described in Sec . 5 . The blue line represents the theoretical best performance obtained using an oracle with prior knowledge of the unit tests . Finally , we compute BLEU scores for all Codex - 12B Hu - manEval samples ( at temperature 0 . 8 ) against their reference solutions . For each problem , when we plot the distributions of BLEU scores for correct and incorrect solutions , we notice signiﬁcant overlap ( Figure 8 ) . Since an incorrect solution is guaranteed to be functionally inequivalent to the reference solution , we conclude that improvements in BLEU score may not indicate improved rates of functional correctness in practice . 3 . 4 . Comparative Analysis of Related Models and Systems Two recent works similar in spirit to Codex are GPT - Neo ( Black et al . , 2021 ) and GPT - J ( Wang & Komatsuzaki , 2021 ) , which are trained on The Pile ( Gao et al . , 2020 ) , a dataset containing text from a variety of sources as well as 8 % GitHub code . The broader research community has found that these models outperform existing GPT systems in qualitative programming evaluations ( Woolf , 2021 ) . We conﬁrm these ﬁndings using the HumanEval dataset , showing that GPT - Neo achieves 6 . 4 % pass @ 1 and 21 . 3 % pass @ 100 , while GPT models of comparable sizes achieve near 0 % on both metrics . We see a remarkable progression in capabilities , with GPT - Neo - 2 . 7B roughly equivalent to Codex - 85M ( 30 × fewer parameters ) . Similarly , GPT - J - 6B achieves 11 . 6 % pass @ 1 and 27 . 7 % pass @ 100 , which is roughly equivalent to Codex - 300M ( 20 × fewer parameters ) . Pass rates are obtained by taking the best result from eval - Figure 8 . BLEU score probability densities for correct ( blue ) and wrong ( green ) solutions from Codex - 12B for 4 random tasks from HumanEval . Note that the distributions are not cleanly separable , suggesting that optimizing for BLEU score is not equivalent to optimizing for functional correctness . uating at temperatures 0 . 2 , 0 . 4 , and 0 . 8 for GPT - Neo , and from temperatures 0 . 2 and 0 . 8 for GPT - J . Detailed results across multiple model sizes can be found in Table 1 . Finally , we benchmark Codex against the largest free model from Tabnine , a leading code autocomplete system , which achieves 2 . 6 % pass @ 1 ( at T = 0 . 4 ) and 7 . 6 % pass @ 100 ( at T = 0 . 8 ) . This is roughly equivalent to Codex - 12M , one of the smallest models in our suite . 3 . 5 . Results on the APPS Dataset Recently , Hendrycks et al . ( 2021 ) introduced the APPS dataset to measure the coding challenge competence of lan - guage models . The APPS dataset consists of 5000 training and 5000 test examples of coding problems , each with a set of unit tests and , for the training data , a set of correct solu - tions . Most of the APPS tests problems are not formulated as single - function synthesis tasks , but rather as full - program synthesis , reading input from stdin and printing output to stdout , in contrast to the main Codex training data . In the paper that introduces APPS , the authors benchmark a few language models and report two metrics : the percentage of problems where the model ﬁnds a correct solution ( called the “strict accuracy” ) and the percentage of unit tests passed , even if the solution is incorrect . The latter measure is re - ported only so as to reduce variance of the measurements , because the results on the ﬁrst metric were so low . We avoid this metric and only focus on “strict accuracy” , and - as in Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code Table 1 . Codex , GPT - Neo , & TabNine evaluations for HumanEval . We ﬁnd that GPT - J pass @ 1 is between Codex - 85M and Codex - 300M performance .

There are 2 additional factors , well - known from coding competitions , that we take into account : • In coding competitions and in the APPS datasets , tasks are provided with 3 input / output examples included in the task description . We utilize this by sampling 1000 solutions from the model and ﬁltering out only those that pass these 3 unit tests ( if such solutions exist ) . We then calculate pass rates in this ﬁltered set , and call it ﬁltered pass @ k . Results without ﬁltering are presented as raw pass @ k . • It is often the case both in coding competitions and in the results from Codex that a correct solution is found , but it is not algorithmically efﬁcient enough to be con - sidered passing . While this is not acceptable in the competitions , we also report the number of solutions that Codex produces that do not fail on any unit test , but that do time - out on some of them . We use a timeout of 3 seconds in our evaluation . To compensate for the fact the Codex is not ﬁne - tuned on APPS , we append a single input / output example from the task description to the docstring as a formatting hint . We de - note this setting as “1 - shot” in Table 2 , and ﬁnd that Codex - 12B evaluated 1 - shot achieves comparable performance to a GPT - Neo model ﬁne - tuned on APPS . Consistent with our earlier ﬁndings , there are large beneﬁts from generating and evaluating as many as 1000 samples per task , though for more difﬁcult problems , solutions are often not efﬁcient enough to pass the time limits . Finally , evaluating the ﬁrst sample which passes the 3 public unit tests for each problem yields higher performance than raw pass @ 100 samples . 4 . Supervised Fine - Tuning In addition to standalone functions , Python code found on GitHub contains class implementations , conﬁguration ﬁles , scripts , and even ﬁles used to store data . This code is seem - ingly unrelated to synthesizing functions from docstrings , and we hypothesize that the distribution mismatch reduces HumanEval performance . In order to adapt Codex to the distribution of the task of in - terest , we construct a set of training problems from correctly implemented standalone functions , and use them for addi - tional supervised ﬁne - tuning . We describe two approaches for collecting these examples : from competitive program - ming websites and from repositories with continuous inte - gration . We call the supervised ﬁne - tuned models Codex - S , and show that they produce consistent gains across model size . 4 . 1 . Problems from Competitive Programming Programming contest and interview preparation websites use hidden unit tests to automatically judge the func - tional correctness of submissions . These problems are self - contained , come with well - written problem statements , and generally have excellent test coverage . Additionally , these problems test algorithmic reasoning over a broad range of core skills and difﬁculties . We collected problem statements , function signatures , and solutions from several popular programming contest and interview preparation websites . We then assembled these into programming tasks similar to HumanEval , using the problem description as the docstring . Since complete test suites are often hidden , we created unit tests from examples found in the problem statements , or extracted additional test cases through submitting incorrect solutions . In total , we curated 10 , 000 problems in this way . 4 . 2 . Problems from Continuous Integration Next , we curated programming problems from open source projects . Taking advantage of sys . setprofile , we were able to trace and collect inputs and outputs for all functions called during integration tests . This data could then be used to create unit tests for the functions . Projects that employ continuous integration ( CI ) are ideal candidates for tracing . We follow the commands in the CI conﬁguration ﬁles , which contain build and test commands , to set up the virtual environments , install dependencies , and run integration tests . We considered GitHub repos using travis and tox as their CI frameworks , as they are two of the most popular CI tools . We additionally used publicly available source code from pip packages found in the python package index ( PyPI ) . Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code Table 2 . Finetuned GPT - Neo numbers from the APPS paper referenced above . For Codex - 12B , the number of passing programs that timeout on some test is in the bracket . We used temperature 0 . 6 for sampling to cover all k in pass @ k , so raw pass @ 1 results could be improved with lower temperature .

While there are millions of potential functions to curate problems from , we only collected about 40 , 000 because not all functions accept inputs and return outputs . Even when they do , most objects captured at runtime cannot be pickled and restored outside the sandbox unless the project was installed . Since our tracing methodology produced inputs and outputs for all invoked functions , even builtin and library calls im - ported by the project were turned into problems . For this reason , functions from tracing tended to be the building blocks of command - line utilities . To excel at these tasks , the model does not need to know advanced algorithms and data structures . Rather , it needs to be able to follow in - structions to implement the functionality speciﬁed in the docstring . Thus , tracing complements the puzzle nature of coding competition problems and broadens the distribution of tasks . 4 . 3 . Filtering Problems In the previous sections , we presented two methods we used to automatically create training problems . However , it is unclear how to control for quality . Some prompts underspecify the function that is implemented , in which case a perfectly valid solution may be wrongly penalized by the unit test . Some problems are stateful , and subsequent executions can result in different outcomes . To address these issues , we use Codex - 12B to generate 100 samples per curated problem . If no samples pass the unit tests , we consider the task to be either ambiguous or too difﬁcult , and ﬁlter it out . We reran this veriﬁcation several times to remove stateful or non - deterministic problems . 4 . 4 . Methods We ﬁne - tune Codex on these training problems to produce a set of “supervised ﬁne - tuned” models , which we call Codex - S . To produce examples from training problems , we assem - ble the problems into the format shown in Figure 2 . If there are prompts of varying length in a batch , we left - pad shorter prompts to the length of the longest prompt , so that the ﬁrst tokens in the reference solutions line up in context . We train to minimize negative log - likelihood of the reference solution , and mask out loss for any tokens in the prompt . We train using a learning rate 1 / 10 as large as used for ﬁne - tuning Codex , but adhere to the same learning rate schedule , and train until validation loss plateaus ( less than 10B tokens ) . 4 . 5 . Results As with Codex , we ﬁrst compute the optimal temperature for evaluating pass @ k for 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 . We ﬁnd that Codex - S prefers slightly higher temperatures for all k > 1 , which possibly reﬂects the fact that Codex - S captures a narrower distribution than Codex . We use T ∗ = 0 for computing pass @ 1 and T ∗ = 1 for computing pass @ 100 . Next , we compare Codex - S against Codex on pass @ 1 and pass @ 100 . Codex - S outperforms the corresponding Codex by an average margin of 6 . 5 percentage points on pass @ 1 and by a larger average margin of 15 . 1 percentage points on pass @ 100 across model size . We also plot the performance of different sample selection heuristics for Codex - S - 12B against the same heuristics for Codex - 12B . When ranking between 1 and 100 samples by mean log probability , the average beneﬁt over random ranking is 11 . 6 percentage points , which is over 2 percentage points higher than the corresponding beneﬁt for Codex . Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code Figure 9 . Optimal sampling temperatures as a function of the num - ber of samples generated for both Codex and Codex - S . Codex - S generally requires a higher temperature for any particular value of k , possibly to compensate for the fact that it models a narrower distribution . Figure 10 . Comparing Codex - S against Codex on the metrics pro - posed in Section 3 . Codex - S is one or two orders of magnitude more parameter efﬁcient on pass @ 1 and pass @ 100 , and log - prob sample ranking with Codex - S yields similar beneﬁts over random sampling that Codex does . 5 . Docstring Generation Generating code from docstrings is possible with Codex because code typically follows after a docstring , but it is not easy to induce Codex to generate docstrings from code . Nev - ertheless , we are motivated to produce a docstring writing model for safety reasons , as such a model can be used to de - scribe the intent behind generated code . Using the training problems described in the previous section , we can eas - ily create a training dataset for code - conditional docstring generation . Speciﬁcally , for each training problem , we assemble a train - ing example by concatenating the function signature , the reference solution , and then the docstring . Just as we train Codex - S by minimizing negative log - likelihood of the ref - erence solution , we train the docstring generating models Codex - D by minimizing negative log - likelihood of the doc - string . When we benchmark our code generation models , we mea - sure pass @ k on the HumanEval dataset , where correctness is deﬁned by passing a set of unit tests . However , there is no similar way to evaluate docstring samples automatically . Therefore , we grade sample docstrings by hand , considering a docstring correct if it uniquely and accurately speciﬁes the code body . Due to the time consuming nature of this process , we only grade 10 samples per problem , for a total of 1640 problems , from Codex - D - 12B at temperature 0 . 8 . Codex - D often generates incorrect unit tests along with a docstring , but we ignore these during grading . However , we do not consider the docstring correct when the model simply copies the code body into the docstring . The most common failure modes we observe are when the docstring model leaves out an important detail ( such as “an answer must be to two decimal places” ) or when it over - conditions on the function name and invents a problem unrelated to the function body . As shown in Table 3 , pass rates for Codex - D are lower but comparable to the corresponding pass rates for Codex - S at the same temperature . We do not have a strong hypothesis for which direction should yield higher pass rates . While generating docstrings may be more forgiving because natu - ral language syntax is less strict than code syntax , docstrings in our dataset may be lower quality because developers tend to devote less time to writing docstrings . Indeed , our model produces docstrings like “I just found this function online” and “This test is not correctly written and it’s not my solu - tion . ” Finally , with a docstring model , we have yet another way to choose a single sample from a set of k samples . In - stead of picking the sample with the best mean log proba - bility as investigated in the previous two sections , we can choose the sample that maximizes the back - translation ob - Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code Table 3 . Pass rates for our docstring generating model Codex - D , which is evaluated by hand - grading 10 samples per task due to the lack of a ground - truth automatic evaluation . We ﬁnd similar but lower pass - rates compared to Codex - S .

Unfortunately , in Figure 7 , we show that ranking samples via back - translation under - performs mean log - probability ranking , though it outper - forms random ranking . This heuristic also appears to overﬁt quickly . 6 . Limitations While Codex is able to sample correct solutions for the majority of HumanEval problems , we ﬁnd that it has a number of limitations . First , Codex is not sample efﬁcient to train . Our training dataset comprises a signiﬁcant fraction of publicly available Python code on GitHub , totaling hundreds of millions of lines of code . Even seasoned developers do not encounter anywhere near this amount of code over their careers . In - deed , a strong student who completes an introductory com - puter science course is expected to be able to solve a larger fraction of problems than Codex - 12B . Next , we explore prompts on which Codex is likely to fail or display counter - intuitive behavior . While evaluating code generation is well - studied ( Xu et al . , 2021 ; Helmuth & Spec - tor , 2015 ; Pantridge et al . , 2017 ) , many existing metrics measure performance in tightly speciﬁed , constrained prob - lem instances ( e . g . , string manipulation in FlashFill ( Gul - wani , 2011 ) ) . Therefore , we developed a set of qualitative metrics for measuring the capabilities of code generating models while controlling for the complexity and abstrac - tion level of the speciﬁcations ( Appendix D ) . Applying this framework , we ﬁnd that Codex can recommend syntacti - cally incorrect or undeﬁned code , and can invoke functions , variables , and attributes that are undeﬁned or outside the scope of the codebase . Moreover , Codex struggles to parse through increasingly long and higher - level or system - level speciﬁcations . To concretely illustrate model performance degradation as docstring length increases , we create a dataset of synthetic problems assembled from 13 basic building blocks , each of which modiﬁes an input string in a deterministic way . Ex - ample building blocks are “convert the string to lowercase” or “remove every third character from the string” ( the full list is described in Appendix C ) . We ﬁnd that as the number of chained building blocks in the docstring increases , model performance decreases exponentially . This behavior is un - characteristic of a human programmer , who should be able to correctly implement a program for a chain of arbitrary length if they can do so for a chain of length two . Figure 11 . Pass rates of Codex - 12B samples against the number of chained components in the synthetically generated docstring . With each additional component , pass rate drops by roughly a factor of 2 - 3 . Further , just as text - conditional generative models in other modalities ( Ramesh et al . , 2021 ) have difﬁculty with bind - ing attributes to objects , Codex can make mistakes binding operations to variables , especially when the number of oper - ations and variables in the docstring is large . For instance , in the following prompt , Codex - 12B does not decrement the variable w and also fails to return the product of all numbers . def do _ work ( x , y , z , w ) : " " " Add 3 to y , then subtract 4 from both x and w . Return the product of the four numbers . " " " t = y + 3 u = x - 4 v = z * w return v This understanding of Codex’s limited system - level synthe - sis capabilities helps inform our assessment of the potential hazards of using it in a generative capacity , as well as the broader societal impacts that such systems could have . 7 . Broader Impacts and Hazard Analysis Codex has the potential to be useful in a range of ways . For example , it could help onboard users to new codebases , reduce context switching for experienced coders , enable non - programmers to write speciﬁcations and have Codex draft implementations , and aid in education and exploration . However , Codex also raises signiﬁcant safety challenges , does not always produce code that is aligned with user intent , Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code and has the potential to be misused . To better understand some of the hazards of using Codex in a generative capacity , we conducted a hazard analysis focused on identifying risk factors ( Leveson , 2019 ) with the potential to cause harm . 1 We outline some of our key ﬁndings across several risk areas below . While some of our ﬁndings about the potential societal impacts of code generation systems were informed by work towards responsible deployment of the production - oriented Codex models ( which descended from the research - oriented Codex models described in this paper ) , this section is not intended to provide a full account of any particular product’s safety features . Unless otherwise speciﬁed , we anchor our analysis in the speciﬁc properties of the models described in this paper . We share this analysis in the belief that some of it generalizes to the broader class of code generation systems , and to encourage a norm of performing detailed impact analysis as part of major machine learning research projects . Note that by focusing largely on risks in this section , we do not mean to imply that we expect the impact of this class of technologies to be net - negative ; rather , risks merit particular attention here because they may be subtle or require deliber - ate effort to address , whereas we expect the beneﬁts to be more obvious and “automatic” from the perspective of most users and affected stakeholders . 7 . 1 . Over - reliance One of the key risks associated with using code generation models in practice is over - reliance on generated outputs . Due to the limitations described above as well as alignment issues described below , Codex may suggest solutions that superﬁcially appear correct but do not actually perform the task the user intended . This could particularly affect novice programmers , and could have signiﬁcant safety implications depending on the context . We discuss a related issue in Appendix G , namely that code generation models can sug - gest insecure code . For these reasons , human oversight and vigilance is required for safe use of code generation systems like Codex . We note several immediate ways to improve safety in the subsection on risk mitigation below , though over - reliance in particular is one that we believe merits further inquiry in industry and academia . While it is conceptually straight - 1 We sought to include harms spanning geographic and temporal scales . We also considered not only the severity and probability , but also the distribution of harms . However , we note that the analysis described here is only one milestone in what we hope will be a larger cross - sectoral and cross - organizational effort to steer code generation in a societally beneﬁcial direction . As we describe our ﬁndings , we note various speciﬁc uncertainties and areas for future work in different sections . Figure 12 . When the prompt includes subtle bugs , Codex tends to produce worse code than it is capable of . This persists when the prompt also includes instructions to write correct code . This gap increases with model size . forward to provide documentation to users reminding them about model limitations , empirical investigation is neces - sary in order to identify how to reliably ensure vigilance in practice across a range of user experience levels , UI designs , and tasks . One challenge researchers should consider is that as capabilities improve , it may become increasingly difﬁcult to guard against “automation bias . ” 7 . 2 . Misalignment As with other large language models trained on a next - token prediction objective , Codex will generate code that is as sim - ilar as possible to its training distribution . One consequence of this is that such models may do things that are unhelpful for the user , despite having the capability to be more helpful ( see Figure 12 ) . For example , if the user has some subtle mistakes in their code , Codex may “deliberately” suggest code that superﬁcially appears good but is incorrect . This is an alignment failure - the model is not aligned with the user’s intentions . Informally , a system is misaligned if there’s some task X that we want it to do , and it is “capable” of doing X but “chooses” not to . In contrast , if a system fails to do X because it does not have the ability to do so , then this system is not misaligned ; it is just incompetent . See Appendix E for more detail , including a more precise deﬁnition of alignment . It is important to study misalignment because it is a problem that is likely to become worse , not better , as the capabili - ties of our systems increase . For example , the model size scaling trend for the example in Figure 12 indicates that misalignment would likely persist and even get worse if data , parameters , and training time were scaled up . While we expect that misaligned behaviour like this is un - likely to cause signiﬁcant harm in current models , it is likely to become more dangerous and harder to eliminate as model Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code capabilities increase . A highly capable but sufﬁciently mis - aligned model trained on user approval might produce ob - fuscated code that looks good to the user even on careful inspection , but in fact does something undesirable or even harmful . 7 . 3 . Bias and representation Mirroring what has been found in the case of other language models trained on Internet data ( Bender et al . , 2021 ; Blod - gett et al . , 2020 ; Abid et al . , 2021 ; Brown et al . , 2020 ) , we found that Codex can be prompted in ways that generate racist , denigratory , and otherwise harmful outputs as code comments , meriting interventions such as those discussed in the subsection on risk mitigation below . We also found that code generation models raise further bias and represen - tation issues beyond problematic natural language : Codex can generate code with structure that reﬂects stereotypes about gender , race , emotion , class , the structure of names , and other characteristics . Particularly in the context of users who might over - rely on Codex or use it without ﬁrst think - ing through project design , this issue could have signiﬁcant safety implications , giving further motivation to discourage over - reliance . We discuss bias and representation issues further in Appendix F . Filtration or modulation of generated outputs , documentation , and other interventions may help to mitigate these risks . 7 . 4 . Economic and labor market impacts Code generation and associated capabilities have several possible economic and labor market impacts . While Codex at its current capability level may somewhat reduce the cost of producing software by increasing programmer produc - tivity , the size of this effect may be limited by the fact that engineers don’t spend their full day writing code ( O * NET , 2021 ) . Other important tasks include conferring with col - leagues , writing design speciﬁcations , and upgrading ex - isting software stacks . 2 We also found that Codex imports packages at different rates , which could advantage some package authors over others , particularly if programmers and engineers come to rely on Codex’s suggestions . Over a longer time horizon , the effects of this class of technologies on software - related labor markets and on the economy more generally could be more substantial as capabilities improve . More study is needed both on the effects of code genera - tion capabilities and on appropriate responses . We discuss economic and labor market implications in more detail in Appendix H . 2 Indeed , BLS classiﬁes computer programmers and software developers separately , where developers are more highly paid than programmers , have more tasks indirectly related to writing and interacting with code , and , in the US , are already projected to see greater demand over the next 10 years ( Li et al . , 2020 ; Bureau of Labor Statistics , 2021a ; b ) . 7 . 5 . Security implications Codex could have various effects on the security landscape . Because Codex can produce vulnerable or misaligned code , 3 qualiﬁed operators should review its generations before ex - ecuting or trusting them , absent appropriate precautions . Future code generation models may be able to be trained to produce more secure code than the average developer , though that is far from certain . Codex could also be misused to aid cybercrime . Although this is worthy of concern , based on our testing , we believe that at their current level of capability , Codex models do not materially lower the barrier to entry for malware devel - opment . 4 We expect that more powerful code generation models will lead to future advancements , and therefore fur - ther research into mitigations and continued study of model capabilities are necessary . The non - deterministic nature of systems like Codex could enable more advanced malware . This non - determinism makes it easier to create diverse software that accomplish the same tasks . While software diversity can sometimes aid defenders , 5 it presents unique challenges for traditional malware detection and antivirus systems that rely on ﬁnger - printing and signature - matching against previously sampled binaries . For example , a more capable code generation model could conceivably advance techniques for generating polymorphic malware . 6 We believe that application secu - rity and model deployment strategies including rate - limiting access and abuse monitoring can manage this threat in the near term ; however , the efﬁcacy of these mitigations may scale sublinearly as more capable models are developed . Similar to large language models , Codex models can learn patterns present in their training data ( Carlini et al . , 2021 ) . Sensitive data present in source code are liable to be pre - dicted by the model . Because Codex is trained on public repositories , we consider any sensitive data present in the training data to have already been compromised . Similarly , the public data should generally be treated as untrusted , as previous work ( Goldblum et al . , 2021 ; Schuster et al . , 2020 ) has found that attackers may be able to corrupt training data to trigger speciﬁc model behaviors at runtime . We further discuss security implications in Appendix G . 3 See Appendix G - Insecure Code for examples of Codex pro - ducing insecure code . 4 For more on characterizing Codex’s capability limitations , see the Limitations section and experiments in the security analysis in Appendix G . 5 For example , by helping to prevent certain types of memory corruption vulnerabilities . See ( Davis , 2018 ) for more . 6 Polymorphic malware is malicious code that mutates its im - plementation while maintaining its function . Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code 7 . 6 . Environmental impacts Codex , like other large generative models , has an energy footprint from both training and inference ( Schwartz et al . , 2019 ; Bender et al . , 2021 ; Patterson et al . , 2021 ) . The origi - nal training of GPT - 3 - 12B consumed hundreds of petaﬂop / s - days of compute , while ﬁne - tuning it to create Codex - 12B consumed a similar amount of compute . This training was performed on a platform ( Azure ) that purchases carbon credits and sources signiﬁcant amounts of renewable energy , reducing its carbon footprint . 7 Compute consumption also has costs in the wider supply chain that can be quite con - centrated on certain regions . 8 Looking more globally and long - term , the compute demands of code generation could grow to be much larger than Codex’s training if signiﬁcant inference is used to tackle challenging problems . 9 7 . 7 . Legal implications There are several legal considerations related to generated code . To begin with , the training of AI systems on Internet data , such as public GitHub repositories , has previously been identiﬁed as an instance of “fair use” ( O’Keefe et al . , 2019 ) . Our preliminary research also ﬁnds that Codex models rarely generate code that is identical to the contents of training data . Such occurrences were < 0 . 1 % in a study examining the frequency of code generations that appear to match code snippets in the training data ( Ziegler , 2021 ) . In these rare instances , the generated code consisted of common expres - sions or conventions within the programming language that appeared over and over again in the training data . We ﬁnd that , to the extent the generated code appears identical to the training data , it is due to the predictive weightings in the model rather than retention and copying of speciﬁc code . Generated code is also responsive and customized to the user’s input , and the user retains complete control over editing and acceptance of the generated code . This can make code generation similar to auto - suggest or auto - completion 7 Microsoft made a commitment in 2020 to shift to 100 per - cent renewable energy supply in its buildings and data centers by 2025 . https : / / blogs . microsoft . com / blog / 2020 / 01 / 16 / microsoft - will - be - carbon - negative - by - 2030 / A full assessment of the envi - ronmental impact of compute use is impossible to conduct without grounding in context and making comparison to the counterfactual impacts of competing products or services . Such analysis is out of scope for this paper . 8 While data center energy usage has become much more efﬁ - cient in recent years ( Masanet et al . , 2020 ) , the production , use , and disposal of semiconductors still imposes environmental and human costs . See , e . g . , ( Crawford , 2021 ) 9 Given that code generation ( and other forms of AI ) might be deployed widely throughout the economy as discussed above , these considerations suggest additional urgency in adopting renewable energy . features that exist as features of other tools of authorship ( e . g . , document editors ) , in the sense that the ﬁnished work is still seen as the author’s . Our commitment to responsible and safe AI includes con - tinued attention to the broader intellectual property impli - cations of code generation systems . We intend to remain engaged with policymakers and experts on these issues so that the users of such systems can ultimately deploy them with conﬁdence . 7 . 8 . Risk mitigation In closing , given the above , models like Codex should be developed , used , and their capabilities explored carefully with an eye towards maximizing their positive social im - pacts and minimizing intentional or unintentional harms that their use might cause . A contextual approach is critical to effective hazard analysis and mitigation , though a few broad categories of mitigations are important to consider in any deployment of code generation models . Careful documentation and user interface design , code re - view requirements , and / or content controls ( e . g . , ﬁltering of outputs ) may help to reduce harms associated with over - reliance as well as offensive content or insecure code gener - ation . In the context of a model made available as a service ( e . g . , via an API ) , policies such as user review , use case restrictions , monitoring , and / or rate limiting may also help to reduce harms associated with malicious use or prevent its use in high - stakes domains for which the models are not well suited . Appendices E , F , G , and H provide further detail on the risks described in this section and outline additional mitigation and research opportunities . 8 . Related Work The deep learning resurgence has led to strong advances in the ﬁeld of program learning . Two popular approaches to neural program learning are program induction and program synthesis . In program induction , a model generates program outputs directly from a latent program representation . Learning to Execute ( Zaremba & Sutskever , 2014 ) demonstrated that models could execute simple tasks like addition and memo - rization . Later attempts at program induction incorporated inductive biases based on modern computing devices , such as the Neural Turing Machine ( Graves et al . , 2014 ) , memory networks ( Weston et al . , 2015 ; Sukhbaatar et al . , 2015 ) , the Neural GPU ( Kaiser & Sutskever , 2015 ) , and the differen - tiable neural computer ( Graves et al . , 2016 ) . More recent approaches like the Neural Program Interpreter ( Reed & de Freitas , 2016 ; Shin et al . , 2018 ; Pierrot et al . , 2021 ) and Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code Universal Transformer ( Dehghani et al . , 2019 ) found recur - rence to be a useful component in program induction . In program synthesis , a model explicitly generates a pro - gram , usually from a natural language speciﬁcation . One of the most popular classical approaches used a probabilis - tic context free grammar ( PCFG ) to generate a program’s abstract syntax tree ( AST ) . Maddison & Tarlow ( 2014 ) im - proved on this setup by learning a state vector used to con - dition child node expansion . Later , Allamanis et al . ( 2015 ) applied this idea in text - to - code retrieval and Yin & Neu - big ( 2017 ) utilized it in text - conditional code generation . Code2seq ( Alon et al . , 2018 ) found that ASTs could also be leveraged for code - to - text generation . Programs can also be synthesized without passing through an AST representation . Hindle et al . ( 2012 ) investigated n - gram language models of code , ﬁnding code to be more predictable than natural language . Latent Predictor Net - works ( Ling et al . , 2016 ) showed that character - level lan - guage models could generate working code for implement - ing Magic the Gathering cards in an online arena , when aided with a latent mode that allows card attributes to be copied into code . DeepCoder ( Balog et al . , 2017 ) trained a model to predict the functions appearing in source code , which could be used to guide program search . Following the success of large natural language models ( De - vlin et al . , 2018 ; Radford et al . , 2019 ; Liu et al . , 2019 ; Raffel et al . , 2020 ; Brown et al . , 2020 ) large scale Transformers have also been applied towards program synthesis . Code - BERT ( Feng et al . , 2020 ) trained the BERT objective on docstrings paired with functions , and obtained strong results on code search . PyMT5 ( Clement et al . , 2020 ) is similar in spirit to our work , and used the T5 objective to train a sys - tem which can translate between non - overlapping subsets of { signature , docstring , body } . We used functional correctness to benchmark our models , and observed improvements on this metric with more sam - pling . SPoC ( Kulal et al . , 2019 ) considered the problem of producing functionally correct code from pseudocode with a ﬁxed budget of compilations , which is similar to our pass @ k metric . TransCoder ( Lachaux et al . , 2020 ) trained a system to translate between programming languages in an unsupervised manner , and also observed that functional correctness better captured the capabilities of their model than BLEU score . In fact , ContraCode ( Jain et al . , 2020 ) leveraged the large space of functionally correct programs to train a contrastive code model , which improved model performance on tasks like type inference . Finally , Robust - Fill ( Devlin et al . , 2017 ) observed that the best way to ﬁnd a program consistent with input examples was to synthesize multiple samples through beam search . Two early domain - speciﬁc datasets used to benchmark neu - ral programming systems were FlashFill ( Gulwani , 2011 ; Gulwani et al . , 2012 ) and Hearthstone ( Ling et al . , 2016 ) , though the community has trended towards broader and more difﬁcult datasets . Barone & Sennrich ( 2017 ) proposed a large training and evaluation dataset consisting of Python declarations , docstrings , and bodies scraped from GitHub . The CodeSearchNet challenge ( Husain et al . , 2019 ) built an even larger corpus from GitHub with data from multiple popular programming languages . Recently , CodeXGLUE ( Lu et al . , 2021 ) aggregated several programming bench - marks , making use of the recently proposed CodeBLEU metric ( Ren et al . , 2020 ) . Most relevant to our evaluation work is the APPS ( Hendrycks et al . , 2021 ) benchmark for measuring functional correctness based on problems from the competitive programming website Codeforces . Finally , we note that coding is a broad activity which in - volves much more than synthesizing code from docstrings . Tufano et al . ( 2020 ) use Transformers to generate unit tests for code which outperformed commercial offerings . Aye et al . ( 2021 ) built an internal auto - complete tool for Face - book , and found that training on accepted user completions boosted system performance . Development also entails lo - cating and ﬁxing bugs . Early works used static or dynamic code analysis ( Agrawal et al . , 1995 ; Korel & Rilling , 1997 ) , learned association rules ( Jeffrey et al . , 2009 ) , and genetic programming ( Goues et al . , 2012 ) to debug faulty code . These approaches relied on running against a test suite to not only evaluate the correctness of suggestions but also expose problems in execution trace or search for a solution . More recent works ( Tufano et al . , 2019 ; Drain et al . , 2021 ) considered bug - ﬁxing as neural machine translation from buggy to correct programs . However , these works used an exact match against a reference instead of functional cor - rectness , citing Qi et al . ( 2015 ) ’s ﬁnding that most of the proposed solutions by genetic search in ( Goues et al . , 2012 ) passed through weak test suites by deleting functionality that failed . Human developers often write test suites with limited but targeted coverage , but this does not always work well against an algorithm , highlighting the challenges of evaluating correctness of programs . 9 . Conclusion We investigated whether it was possible to train large lan - guage models to produce functionally correct code bodies from natural language docstrings . By ﬁne - tuning GPT on code from GitHub , we found that our models displayed strong performance on a dataset of human - written problems with difﬁculty level comparable to easy interview problems . Model performance could be improved by training on a distribution more similar to the evaluation set , and also by producing multiple samples from a model . We also found that it was simple to train a model to complete the reverse Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code task of producing docstrings from code bodies , and that the performance proﬁles of these models were similar . Finally , we expanded on the broader impacts of code generating models , and discussed model limitations , ﬁnding signiﬁcant room for improvement .

Estimating pass @ k While all estimators mentioned previously are consistent , only the empirical estimate used by Kulal et al . ( 2019 ) , and ( 1 ) are unbiased . Evaluating pass @ k in an unbiased way with any number of samples n is important for fair comparison . For example , estimating pass @ k = 1 − ( 1 − pass @ 1 ) k with 1 − ( 1 − ˆ p ) k using the empirical pass @ 1 , results in a consistent underestimate as shown in Figure 13 . The gap doesn’t fully close even when n > 5 k , and results can seem better with more samples . The interpretation of this estimator is that we draw k samples with replacement from a pool of n candidates , but the k samples are not independent . ( 1 ) is unbiased , because it estimates the fail probability ( 1 − pass @ 1 ) k as the probability of drawing k failed samples without replacement . To show this , note that c , the number of correct samples that pass the unit tests , is distributed Binom ( n , p ) , where p is pass @ 1 , and that ( 1 ) evaluates to 1 when n − c < k . Then , Figure 13 . Comparing the amount of bias and variance of two estimators of pass @ k . While the top expression may look correct , it underestimates the true value by a considerable margin . The unbiased estimator may have a slightly higher variance initially but allows for a fair comparison across different numbers of samples .

Building Blocks for Synthetic Tasks We describe the 13 building blocks used to create synthetic tasks for evaluating model performance as a function of docstring complexity . Each building block is speciﬁed by a line of text and a line of code : 1 . “remove all instances of the letter e from the string” s = s . replace ( " e " , " " ) 2 . “replace all spaces with exclamation points in the string” s = s . replace ( " " , " ! " ) 3 . “convert the string s to lowercase” s = s . lower ( ) 4 . “remove the ﬁrst and last two characters of the string” s = s [ 2 : - 2 ] 5 . “removes all vowels from the string” s = " " . join ( char for char in s if char not in " aeiouAEIOU " ) 6 . “remove every third character from the string” s = " " . join ( char for i , char in enumerate ( s ) if i % 3 ! = 0 ) 7 . “drop the last half of the string , as computed by char - acters” s = s [ : len ( s ) / / 2 ] 8 . “replace spaces with triple spaces” s = s . replace ( " " , " " ) 9 . “reverse the order of words in the string” s = " " . join ( s . split ( ) [ : : - 1 ] ) 10 . “drop the ﬁrst half of the string , as computed by num - ber of words” s = " " . join ( s . split ( ) [ len ( s . split ( ) ) / / 2 : ] ) 11 . “add the word apples after every word in the string” s = " " . join ( word + " apples " for word in s . split ( ) ) 12 . “make every other character in the string uppercase” s = " " . join ( char . upper ( ) if i % 2 = = 0 else char for i , char in enumerate ( s ) ) Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code 13 . “delete all exclamation points , question marks , and periods from the string” s = " " . join ( [ x for x in s if x not in " . ! ? " ] ) These building blocks can be easily composed by concate - nating their one - line descriptions into a docstring and by concatenating their one - line implementations into a code body . An example is shown below : def string _ manipulation ( s : str ) : " " " This function takes a string as input , then returns the result of performing the following sequence of manipulations on that string : - make every other character in the string uppercase - replace spaces with triple spaces " " " s = " " . join ( char . upper ( ) if i % 2 = = 0 else char for i , char in enumerate ( s ) ) s = s . replace ( " " , " " ) return s D . Details of Speciﬁcation - based Evaluation Framework Evaluating the capabilities of code synthesis and generation is not a novel problem and has been explored in both the ML ( Xu et al . , 2021 ) and synthesis ( Helmuth & Spector , 2015 ; Pantridge et al . , 2017 ) communities . Previously , re - searchers have recommended the use of existing metrics such as McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity ( CC ) . That is , syn - thesis and generation metrics have largely concentrated on analyzing the correctness and complexity of the code output rather than the expressivity and complexity of the speciﬁca - tion itself . Yet , evaluating the output of synthesized code is moot if there is no speciﬁcation that it can be measured against . Indeed , the synthesis and automatic programming community ( O’Neill & Spector , 2019 ) have recently called for principled benchmarks and grand challenge problems to be made in order to adopt a scientiﬁcally rigorous approach to compare synthesis methodologies against . If we wish to understand the performance of generation and synthesis models relative to human ability , we should evaluate them against the complexity and expressivity of speciﬁcation prompts , and assess their capability to under - stand and execute them . Given the ambiguity of natural lan - guage speciﬁcations , the challenge arises in how to deﬁne an appropriate set of benchmarks with increasingly complex and higher - level speciﬁcations to measure the capabilities of advancing code synthesis and generation methodologies ( without the use of formal speciﬁcations themselves ) . We thus propose adapting attributes used to measure the expressivity and complexity of formal speciﬁcations to nat - ural language prompts . This entails evaluating the ability to reason over computations and states at different levels of abstractions ( e . g . , high - level requirements versus design - level requirements ) as a base metric for complexity and expressivity ( e . g . , variable dependencies , inter - procedural reasoning , computational interleavings , etc . ) . Below we provide brief descriptions of such attributes and qualitative metrics , which are to be further discussed in a forthcoming paper along with associated results for Codex models . With regard to speciﬁcation abstractions , higher - level re - quirements or speciﬁcations are often distinct from lower - level speciﬁcations through the allocation of further struc - ture and behavior within a deﬁned boundary to satisfy one or more higher - level requirements . That is , the lower - level the speciﬁcation , the more well - deﬁned the architectural and programming constructs become . Indeed , there would be more ambiguity and difﬁculty in deﬁning higher - level speciﬁcations for code synthesis , as the algorithm would need to implicitly derive an internal set of “lower - level” speciﬁcations before synthesizing the corresponding code solution . The degrees of separation between requirements and code would be greater , and would entail the synthesis of inter - procedural and architectural solutions across a large unconstrained space . However , if a lower - level speciﬁcation is provided with well - deﬁned constraints , this not only re - stricts the possible solutions , but also reduces the degrees of separation between the speciﬁcation and the code required to be produced ( e . g . , to one function ) . The current capabilities of synthesis methodologies are only able to tackle tightly speciﬁed , constrained problem in - stances or narrow tasks . However , Codex has demonstrated preliminary capabilities to consistently solve for high - level speciﬁcations . Beyond the speciﬁcation abstraction level , language - independent properties should be considered that would be practiced by developers at various degrees of expertise and thus would implicitly be expressed in natural language prompts and speciﬁcations . These include : • Variable Interdependencies : Tracking state of more than one variable , their interdependencies and nesting , all possible permutations of state , and the relationship between input and output parameters • Temporal Reasoning : as consideration of future and past program states including – Safety properties entailing that a deﬁned “bad” state never occurs – Liveness properties entailing progress towards a speciﬁc goal or state • Concurrency and Parallelism : Correct and sound reasoning over computational interleavings ( for vari - ous speciﬁcation granularities ) . The code generation Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code technique should be able to reason or synthesize solu - tions requiring properties such as : – Strong Fairness : every process that is inﬁnitely often enabled should be executed inﬁnitely often in a state where it is enabled – Weak Fairness : every process that is almost al - ways enabled should be executed inﬁnitely often – Mutual exclusion , atomicity , and synchronization – Freedom from race conditions and data races • Hyperproperties ( Clarkson et al . , 2014 ) : Information - ﬂow policies and cryptographic algorithms requiring observational determinism which requires programs to behave as ( deterministic ) functions from low - security inputs to low - security outputs such as : – Noninterference : when the outputs observed by low - security users are the same as they would be in the absence of inputs submitted by high - security users . • Nondeterminism : In computational theory , a nonde - terministic algorithm can provide different outputs for the same input on different executions . Unlike a de - terministic algorithm which produces only a single output for the same input even on different runs , a non - deterministic algorithm travels in various routes to arrive at the different outcomes . A very simple and common example of this is a random number genera - tor 10 . A more advanced and extreme example is ML algorithms themselves . Additionally , we note to the reader that there are a number of speciﬁcation - independent coding practices that must be exhibited to achieve the aforementioned computational and state reasoning attributes . Such attributes have long been discussed by the genetic programming community ( Koza et al . , 1999 ) , and we note the relevant properties to modern day synthesis techniques below : • Code and parameterized reuse • Automatic determination of program architecture • Wide range of programming constructs • Well - deﬁned • Wide applicability 10 A randomized algorithm is actually probabilistic Turing Ma - chine , but for practical intents and purpose it can be approximately considered non - deterministic given the determinism of real - world systems ( see ( Barrington & Maciel , 2000 ) ) Note that many of the attributes and metrics deﬁned regard implementation level design . Increasingly higher level spec - iﬁcations should not need to specify which programming constructs are required by implementation , and a code gen - eration algorithm should be able to infer this instead . Indeed , such constructs are required by developers when solving for increasingly complex and higher - level speciﬁcations . With - out them , it is unlikely that a code generation technique can tackle increasingly complex speciﬁcations describing and requiring the computational and state reasoning attributes noted . E . Analysis of Alignment Problems E . 1 . Why evaluate alignment ? We were interested in detecting problems with the Codex models that will not improve , or may even get more severe , as model capability improves . These are the problems that are likely to become most serious in the long term even if they currently do not cause signiﬁcant harm . The idea of “alignment” is intended to capture one set of problems that have this property . In the literature , a model is deﬁned informally as “intent aligned” with a user if ( and only if ) the model intends to do what the user wants ( Chris - tiano , 2018 ; Kenton et al . , 2021 ) . It is ambiguous how to apply this deﬁnition to Transformer models , since it is unclear to what extent they can be de - scribed as having “intent” , or what that intent would be . However , there is an intuitive notion that , given its training objective , Codex is better described as “trying” to continue the prompt by either matching or generalizing the training distribution , than as “trying” to be helpful to the user . This caches out in predictions that the model will complete confused code with confused code , insecure code with in - secure code ( see G ) , or biased code with similarly biased code ( see F ) , regardless of the model’s capability to produce secure , unbiased , and high - quality code . In fact , we would expect that the model may “intentionally” introduce each of these types of ﬂaws at some rate even when prompted with fairly good inputs . E . 2 . How can alignment be deﬁned and evaluated in models like Codex ? Deﬁning alignment is complex , and there is not yet a sat - isfactory formalization . Without intending this to be the last word on deﬁning alignment , we attempt to capture the intuitive idea described above in a way that can be measured experimentally . We operationalize sufﬁcient conditions for intent misalignment for a generative model as follows : 1 . We consider a model capable of some task X if it has Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code Figure 14 . When the prompt includes subtle bugs , Codex tends to produce worse code than it is capable of producing . This gap increases with model size . Including an instruction to write correct code helps a little but does not ﬁx the problem . Even with no examples in the context , Codex produces signiﬁcantly worse code than it is capable of . the ( possibly latent ) capacity to perform task X . Some sufﬁcient conditions for the model being capable of X would be : • It can be made to perform task X by prompt engi - neering , by ﬁne - tuning on a much smaller quan - tity of data than used in pre - training , by model surgery , or some other technique which harnesses capabilities latent in the model rather than adding new capabilities ; or • We can construct some other task Y , for which we know the model needs to do X in order to solve Y , and we observe that the model is capable of Y 2 . We say a model is intent misaligned if it outputs B , in some case where the user would prefer it outputs A , and where the model is both : ( a ) capable of outputting A instead , and ( b ) capable of distinguishing between situations where the user wants it to do A and situations where the user wants it to do B 11 E . 3 . Results of alignment evaluations We conducted several alignment evaluations . In the example evaluation shown in Figure 14 , we deduce that the model is capable of outputting code with a lower frequency of bugs , based on the rate of bugs when prompted with high - quality 11 This deﬁnition has various problems and subtleties , which this margin is too small to contain . code . We instruct the model to write correct code , and we assume the model could easily be ﬁne - tuned to detect such an instruction . This implies that the model is capable of distinguishing between situations where the user does and does not want buggy code . We observe that in fact , it outputs code with a higher frequency of bugs when prompted with buggy code . Based on this we conclude that we have identiﬁed misalign - ment in Codex models . There are several subtleties here ; probably the most im - portant one is distinguishing our observations from a ro - bustness failure . If the subtly buggy code is sufﬁciently out - of - distribution , we might observe that the model per - forms worse in these cases , simply because it is thrown off by the OOD input - it is not in fact capable of outputting good code after seeing OOD prompts . We believe this is unlikely to be a large factor here , as the GitHub dataset contains plenty of poor - quality code . The bugs are designed to be of the sort we’d expect to appear commonly in the dataset ; code that compiles and often runs without errors but gives an incorrect answer . Examples include off - by - one errors or single - character typographic errors . E . 4 . Areas for Further Work We hope that measuring ( and improving ) alignment will become standard practice for research on powerful ML mod - els . The datasets used for these evaluations are available at https : / / github . com / openai / code - align - evals - data . There are many promising directions for improving align - ment of current code - generation models , which also have the potential to substantially boost models’ usefulness ( Ken - ton et al . , 2021 ) . One starting point is to more carefully curate the pre - training dataset to remove buggy or insecure code . Another possi - bility is to label the pre - training data based on code quality , then condition the model on the ’high quality’ label at de - ployment time ( Keskar et al . , 2019 ) . A common approach to adjusting the behavior of Trans - formers is to ﬁne - tune large pre - trained models with cu - rated or human - generated datasets of the desired behavior ( e . g . , Raffel et al . ( 2020 ) ; He et al . ( 2020 ) ) . In this case we might want to ﬁne - tune on a dataset of high - quality , bug - free code . However , it is notoriously difﬁcult for most humans to write bug - free code , so rather than acquiring this dataset through labeling it might need to be obtained by ﬁltering input datasets using formal analysis or other metrics of code quality . A further possibility is RL from Human Feedback ( RLHF ) , which has been successfully applied to language models to improve alignment and consequently improve performance Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code on downstream tasks ( Stiennon et al . , 2020 ) . In the context of code models , this would involve collect - ing data from human labelers on whether generations were correct and helpful . Assisting human labelers with existing automated testing and formal veriﬁcation tools , or even tools built with the code - generating models themselves , may be useful for providing a correct reward signal for RL or expert iteration . Fully aligning models on tasks that are hard for human la - belers , especially if the models are more knowledgeable or capable in some regards than their supervisors , is a challeng - ing open research problem . Determining whether a model is fully aligned is also difﬁcult , and more work is needed on metrics for alignment . Transparency tools that let us understand the model well enough to determine whether it is aligned , even if we are unable to evaluate alignment purely from input - output behaviour , are especially needed . Although it is challenging , successfully aligning Codex and similar models would likely be very useful . A fully - aligned code - generating model would always write the best code it was capable of , refrain from ’deliberately’ introducing bugs , and follow the user’s instructions . This would be a signiﬁcantly more helpful coding assistant . E . 5 . Experiment Details The alignment evaluations are based on the HumanEval dataset described earlier in the paper : 158 problems with a docstring describing the task , reference solution , and tests . We took a subset of 30 eval problems , 12 and for each wrote one solution with a subtle bug . We construct prompts by prepending these solutions to the task docstring prompts for the HumanEval task . We either prepend three examples of [ docstring + correct solution ] , or three examples of [ docstring + solution with subtle bugs ] , each sampled i . i . d . from the 30 problems mentioned above ( excluding the current task ) . We include examples where we insert # instruction : write correct code even if the previous code contains bugs before the start of the task docstring . We then evaluate the performance of the Codex models on all 158 examples from the HumanEval dataset , comparing the models’ performance on the prompts with correct so - lutions prepended , no solutions prepended , and prompts with subtly buggy solutions prepended . We ensure that the current task being evaluated never appears in the prompt . We used T = 0 . 2 , following the evaluations in the main paper . 12 The ﬁrst 30 alphabetically by function name The datasets are available at https : / / github . com / openai / code - align - evals - data .

Supplemental Bias Analysis Generative models have been shown to encode bias in modalities such as natural language ( Brown et al . , 2020 ; Blodgett et al . , 2020 ) and images ( Radford et al . , 2021 ) , and we ﬁnd that the same is true of models like Codex that gener - ate code . Given the ways and contexts in which code is used and reused , and the role code plays in laying the foundations for world - changing applications , the generation of biased code has the potential to cause allocative or representational harms , and to do so at scale . 13 While it can be tempting to think of code generation models as objective tools , we aim to demonstrate how they can be far from that , and that the models can inherit the legacy of outdated and otherwise troublesome ideas . This is one key reason why code generated by the Codex models should be treated as untrusted by those using it for research or devel - opment until they have reviewed and veriﬁed its accuracy and ﬁtness for purpose themselves . As the research community explores more powerful code 13 Allocative harms occur when a system allocates or withholds a certain opportunity or resource . Representational harms occur when systems reinforce the subordination of some groups along the lines of identity , e . g . stereotyping or denigration ( Crawford , 2017 ) . Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code generation tools that might be increasingly relied on , these issues become even more relevant and holistic assessment across verticals such as bias becomes crucial for determining safety for deployment . In this section , we discuss our probes for bias in three areas : classiﬁcation completions in sensitive domains ; generated text such as comments or docstrings ; and package import suggestions . Note that in this appendix , we explore the biases reﬂected in the ”unﬁltered” outputs of Codex models , which in turn were built for research purposes . Thus , these results may not all be representative of a production setting where miti - gations such as output ﬁlters or alignment techniques may be applied . F . 1 . Probes for classiﬁcation prompts and completions that encode bias In order to better understand the potential that code genera - tion has to encode bias in the context of Codex in particular , we developed a series of probes for instances of harmful bias in single - and multi - line autocompletions . We found that , in response to simple prompts like def gender ( x ) : , the generations often assumed binary gender for both single - and multi - line autocompletions . 14 When we probed us - ing the prompt def race ( x ) : , we found that many of the most commonly - generated completions assumed a small number of mutually exclusive race categories . Most syn - thesized completions included “White” and many included only a few other categories , followed by “other . ” Several synthesized generations included only 3 categories : “white , ” “black , ” or “none . ” Prompts for probes related to classiﬁcation of protected classes are often leading in their own right , and just as buggy prompts result in buggy code , it’s likely that biased prompts or prompts for harmful behavior result in harmful code . Thus more work is needed not just in correcting harm and bias in the model but potentially in training the model not to respond to sensitive or context - dependent prompts . We started with a handful of prompts related to gender that are themselves potentially “leading” of harmful behavior , trying to gauge what the Python model had learned about common representations of gender in code . These representations are learned not just from training data that encodes social biases but also code written to process 14 There are fundamental issues with classiﬁcation of people into discrete gender and race categories , not least because neither can be reduced to a set of discrete categories . Discrete categorization of people on the basis of race and gender usually elides important nuances in the diversity of human racial and gender identities . We chose to begin with these classiﬁcation prompts in order to probe whether the use of automated code generation could have the potential to reinforce biased assumptions that might exacerbate the harms potential of these tasks . and analyze datasets that encode classes in potentially harm - ful ways . More insidious are cases where the model may exacerbate harm or suggest harmful things in instances where an engi - neer was working on something else or didn’t necessarily un - derstand they were veering into harmful territory . For exam - ple , in a few instances we began with classiﬁcation of “age” and , after suggesting code completions for classiﬁcation along those lines , Codex went on to suggest classiﬁcations along even more sensitive lines , including classiﬁcation of “emotion . ” F . 2 . Analyzing bias in text generated by Codex In addition to generating semantically meaningful source code , Codex can also be used to produce text , e . g . in the form of comments or docstrings . Similar to language mod - els , Codex could be used in ways that denigrate groups or individuals . A priori , one might expect that ﬁne - tuning on a dataset of code would decrease the extent to which comments would produce blatantly prejudiced text , as code comments are typically more neutral than the distribution of text on the Internet . 15 On the other hand , it might be that the production of text in comments largely relies on Codex’s priors as a language model , resulting in little difference between Codex and GPT - 3 . To test these hypotheses and the related harms , we com - pared GPT - 3 to Codex comment production on a series of co - occurrence tests across gender , race , and religion . 16 Very broadly , we found that when explicitly prompted to talk about speciﬁc genders , races , and religions , Codex com - ments tend to reproduce similar biases to GPT - 3 , albeit with less diversity in the outputs . For example , with religion “Islam” , in both models we observed occurrences of the word “terrorist” and “violent” at a greater rate than with other groups , but GPT - 3’s outputs included more variants on these themes . There are several caveats to this procedure . Co - occurrence is a blunt instrument , as it doesn’t pick up on the subtleties of how a particular word is used in context , only that it is used in context . Additionally , since we are prompting both models to explicitly describe groups , they are not from the models talking about these group features in the wild , but rather in a constrained experimental setup . 15 To conﬁrm this intuition , we ran our co - occurrence evalu - ations on the comments in our ﬁne - tuning GitHub dataset and found that negative , occupation - related , and profane words did not preferentially occur in the presence of group words ( race , gender , religion ) . 16 Co - occurrence tests measure which words are likely to occur in the neighborhood of other words . We followed the same pro - cedure as the Fairness , Bias , and Representation analysis in the GPT - 3 paper ( Brown et al . , 2020 ) . Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code How impactful are these textual harms ? If it’s true that text produced by Codex picks up Internet - scale biases like GPT - 3 , then one might expect the impact of these harms to be similar to GPT - 3’s . However , this reasoning ignores the likely use cases of the two systems . We’ve observed that in typical use , Codex is less open - ended than GPT - 3 : those who use it tend to prompt it in a more precise and neutral manner , though this is not always the case . Thus , we tentatively believe that the average case textual harms are lower in Codex , but the worst - case harms are likely similar to those of GPT - 3 . If this is the case , then it might be that the textual harms in Codex are more naturally understood as a robustness issue : when the model is used to produce comments in an out - of - distribution fashion , it tends to act like GPT - 3 . G . Supplemental security analysis G . 1 . Threat actors The threat landscape for Codex is similar to that of language models . 17 Actors can range from low and moderately skilled or resourced actors to well - resourced and highly - organized “advanced persistent threat” ( APT ) groups . Similarly , their strategic objectives can non - exhaustively include making money , causing chaos , obtaining information , and / or achiev - ing speciﬁc operational goals for their respective organiza - tions . However , the manner in which Codex models may be misused will likely differ from that of language models . G . 2 . Potential misuse applications One way to frame Codex’s capability is that Codex ex - cels in its ability to write boilerplate . 18 In the near - term , threat actors may be interested in utilizing Codex or similar families of models to assist in the production of malware , facilitating phishing , or for other unauthorized offensive pur - poses . However , it is our assessment that Codex models do not differentially enable offensive cybersecurity capabilities because they are not more efﬁcient or effective than conven - tional tools or techniques are . One possible exception to this is the development of polymorphic malware , which is discussed in 7 . 5 . We discuss additional investigations into Codex’s ability to aid malicious use - cases in the next few paragraphs . We conducted experiments on Codex’s ability to generate malicious code . While we found that while Codex is not proﬁcient at generating standalone malicious code , it is still capable of generating code that can be incorporated as components of more complex systems . For example , while 17 See the threat analysis in Section 6 . 1 of ( Brown et al . , 2020 ) 18 By boilerplate , we mean code that takes a small amount of cognitive effort for experienced engineers to write , but is a step beyond simply copy - pasting code snippets we found that the model struggled with generating SQL and shell injection payloads , it had no problem generating code for recursively encrypting ﬁles in a directory . 19 We experimented with applying Codex models to vulnera - bility discovery . While vulnerability discovery capabilities have defensive applications , they are also potential misuse vectors because discovery is a precursor to exploitation . We found that Codex did not perform well when compared even to rudimentary Static Application Security Testing ( SAST ) tools . These tools generally excel at ﬁnding simple vul - nerabilities that can be identiﬁed via rulesets , but fall short on “business logic” vulnerabilities that are deﬁned by their context like improper authorization . We encountered no cases in our testing where using a Codex model led to better or more efﬁcient results than SAST tools . We expect that sufﬁciently capable models will excel at discovering these types of high - dimension vulnerabilities , so this is an area for further research as model capabilities improve . We investigated whether Codex models would suggest vul - nerable , malicious , or typosquatted software dependencies as part of a supply chain attack . For example , speciﬁc ver - sions of Python packages may contain vulnerabilities that would render a downstream application vulnerable as well . However , Codex is generally unable to suggest speciﬁc ver - sions of packages , as package versions are speciﬁed outside of the prompt context that Codex is aware of . 20 Also wor - rying is the possibility of Codex suggesting malicious or typosquatted packages ( Ohm et al . , 2020 ) . Through test - ing , we found that the likelihood of Codex suggesting a vulnerable or malicious package is low in aggregate . How - ever , when prompted with an initial misspelled stem of a typosquatted package that was previously removed from PyPi , Codex would complete the suggestion . Similarly , Codex will suggest a typosquatted package if asked to use the package speciﬁcally . In summary , Codex does not miti - gate human error with misspelled package names . If Codex has a tendency to complete misspelled package names , then this could constitute an attack vector for typosquatting . We explored whether Codex models would be suitable for generating phishing pretext . We found that models trained on source code offered no advantages over conventional language models because the domains are fundamentally different . 21 Because of the training process of pre - training and ﬁne - tuning on public data , there is a natural trust boundary 19 For more on characterizing Codex’s capability limitations , see the Limitations section . 20 While Python package imports may be observable in the prompt context , package version information is relegated to a separate manifest ﬁle and / or the installed package ﬁles themselves . 21 See Section 6 . 1 . 3 of Brown et al . ( 2020 ) for an analysis of conventional language models Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code present in the training data , wherein an attacker could insert adversarial inputs that cause models to suggest vulnerable , malicious , or misaligned code . The pre - training and ﬁne - tuning processes should generally be thought of as untrusted . This risk may increase as model capabilities and the interest of potential attackers increase . Finally , the Codex model itself may suggest insecure or otherwise bad code . Examples include suggesting a com - promised package as a dependency , invoking functions inse - curely , or suggesting secrets found in the training data . 22 If Codex models become widespread software infrastructure , this could constitute a new type of supply chain risk . We discuss this more in the next section . Beyond computer security , we also considered the possibil - ity that code generation systems might provide actors with the ability to synthesize portions of highly complex safety - critical systems with offensive capabilities . We concluded that there is a low likelihood of Codex synthesizing stand - alone safety - critical systems due to a lack of system - level generation capabilities , as discussed in Appendix D . Codex models could also potentially accelerate some instances of machine learning development , which in turn could have downstream misuse implications . While again Codex does not appear capable of synthesizing highly complex systems , we have found it to be somewhat effective at generating boil - erplate machine learning code that has a similar structure to code it has seen in its training set . As with GPT - 3 , we discussed possible misuse scenarios with professional threat analysts and monitored forums for evidence of actors using language models to generate code to augment cybercrime operations . We observed enthusiasm for training models on code and projects focused on au - tomating coding tasks , but no references to using language models for malware development . We noted that enthusiasm and projects were centered around freely - available language models . This highlights a need for robust monitoring and continued research to maintain situational awareness about how models like Codex are being used and misused . G . 3 . Insecure code generation Similar to the alignment problems in Appendix E , a security - relevant subclass of behaviors is the generation of insecure code . A priori , we might expect that Codex will sometimes produce insecure code because the pre - training and ﬁne - tuning paradigm involves training on large quantities of untrusted data , which is known to contain insecure code . A simple mental model is that Codex can pick up “bad habits” from its training data . But what does this look like 22 Previous work ( Carlini et al . , 2021 ) has found that it is possible to extract training data from large language models . in practice ? 23 To study this phenomenon , we asked Codex to suggest code that would call cryptographic libraries to generate crypto - graphic contexts , and then evaluated whether any of these outputs were clearly insecure . 24 When tested on a standard series of prompts asking the models to call functions to produce RSA keys or AES contexts , 25 we ﬁnd that Codex models of varying sizes frequently use clearly insecure con - ﬁgurations ( See Figure 15 ) . Interestingly , we do not see a robust model size trend ( over 1 order of magnitude of parameters ) in this data . This suggests that insecure code production , at least in this case , is an alignment issue ( see Appendix E ) : it is unclear if the models are improving with scale . A larger study using the most common insecure code vulnerabilities may shed more light on this issue . H . Supplemental economic analysis The economic and labor market implications of code gener - ation are only beginning to emerge , and more analysis will be required to fully understand them . In this appendix , we outline some possible types of impacts that occur , but we emphasize that this analysis is highly preliminary : many uncertainties remain about the technological trajectory and economic adoption of code generation . We include this anal - ysis primarily to motivate further related work rather than to suggest any strong conclusions , and we will highlight several promising directions for further exploration . Code generation could help create economic value by allow - ing engineers and programmers to write better code , write 23 Previous work ( Schuster et al . , 2020 ) has found that it is possible to poison training data for code autocompleters and trigger them at runtime to make insecure suggestions such as improper cryptographic function usage . 24 This corresponds to the OWASP Top 10 2017 Category A6 - Security Misconﬁguration ( owa , 2017 ) , or MITRE’s CWE - 327 ( cwe , 2006 ) . For example , MITRE recommends ( cwe , 2009 ) that RSA keys must be 2048 bits or larger . We test Codex’s ability to produce keys with this property in this experiment . 25 We used 5 prompts across different libraries for RSA and AES based on Sonar Source’s Python vulnerability database , and generated ˜30k samples total . We then removed some generated samples based on expected runtime errors , as different model sizes tend to vary in whether they produce code that runs . RSA keys were considered improperly conﬁgured if they were shorter than 2048 bits . AES contexts were considered improperly conﬁgured if they used the ECB cipher mode ( see Menezes et al . ( 2018 ) , p . 228 ) . There is more complexity behind choosing an appropriate cipher than not using ECB , however this test was chosen because ECB is rarely desired . We chose these two tests to evaluate as targets because there is consensus among cryptography experts that these conﬁgurations generally should not be used , and these were reasonable to evaluate programmatically . Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code Figure 15 . Clearly insecure encryption keys produced by Codex . When asked to create encryption keys , Codex models select clearly insecure conﬁguration parameters in a signiﬁcant fraction of cases . We evaluated outputs as clearly insecure if : ( a ) RSA keys were shorter than 2048 bits , ( b ) AES contexts used the ECB cipher mode . Because security standards change over time as capabilities improve , this is likely an underestimate of the true rate of improperly conﬁgured outputs . Similarly , the produced sam - ples that were not classiﬁed as clearly insecure are not necessarily secure , as our tests measure insecurity . good code faster , and help with tasks like docstrings , docu - mentation , tests , code reviews , etc . In turn , these impacts may change the work of engineers and programmers ( people who directly write or read code for a living ) as well as work more broadly by lowering the barrier to building software and enabling entirely new kinds of software to be built . Codex is one of several existing tools to assist in code gen - eration , which have varying economic implications . We focus here on ways in which Codex might have a larger im - pact than previous code generation tools given its stronger performance with the Python language . H . 1 . Impacts on programmers and engineers At a coarse - grained level , by potentially increasing program - mer and engineer productivity , Codex may somewhat reduce the overall cost of producing software . This effect may be limited by the fact that the production of software requires more tasks than writing code ( O * NET , 2021 ) – other impor - tant tasks include conferring with colleagues , writing design specs , and upgrading existing software stacks . Indeed , the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) classiﬁes computer pro - grammers and software developers separately , where devel - opers are more highly paid than programmers , have more tasks indirectly related to writing and interacting with code , and , in the US , are projected to see greater demand over the next 10 years ( Li et al . , 2020 ) . Additionally , one of the challenges of code generation stem from relying on the assumption that intent is captured suf - ﬁciently enough in comments and documentation to not compromise accuracy . This in turn implies some inherent overhead : framing comments and prompts precisely enough to extract the best behavior from the model and reviewing the code generated by the model . Thus , even if the model were perfectly accurate , we would not expect it to reduce the labor costs associated with writing code to zero . Fur - thermore , as with many tools that substitute investments in capital for investments in labor ( or increase the productiv - ity of labor ) ( Frey , 2019 ; Acemoglu & Restrepo , 2020a ; b ) , more sophisticated future code generation tools could poten - tially contribute to the displacement of some programmer or engineer roles , and could change the nature of , and power dynamics involved in , programming work . However , they might instead simply make the work of some engineers more efﬁcient , or , if used to produce larger amounts of sloppier code , they could create the illusion of increased efﬁciency while ofﬂoading the time spent writing code to more detailed code reviews and QA testing . At the same time , Codex may create new markets for work that complement changed workﬂows . After the release of GPT - 3 , a few companies began to include working with GPT - 3 and writing prompts in job listings . And research shows that so - called prompt engineering can enable stronger results from AI systems ( Zhao et al . , 2021 ) . Similarly , it is possible that models like Codex will lead to the emer - gence of new kinds of work for engineers who are skilled at working with such tools . Because of Codex’s performance on “coding challenge” like questions ( as referenced in the APPS results ) , we expect strong performance on interview - style questions . This may encourage employers to reconsider the screening process for coding - related positions . H . 2 . Differential impacts among engineers Certain kinds of code and roles may be more likely to be affected by the diffusion of code generation models than others . It is thus valuable to explore whether systematic patterns might be expected in who might win and lose from this class of technologies across demographic categories . Given Codex’s performance on Python , we expect its im - pacts to be felt more strongly in roles where Python is the dominant programming language ( future models might have different strength proﬁles ) . 26 However , even if this were 26 There is unfortunately only limited research on the demo - graphic distribution of Python users . Understanding this better could shed light on how the beneﬁts and risks associated with Codex might be distributed across society . A 2020 survey of Stack - Overﬂow users ( Stack Overﬂow , 2020 ) suggests that women are comparatively more represented in data science and analysis roles than in DevOps specialist , system administrator , and site reliability Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code true , whether the effect is positive or negative may vary with how engineers and programmers learn to incorporate these tools into their workﬂows . One might think that those who work with programming languages that Codex excels at would have the most to lose in the event that tools built on top of these models substitute for human labor . How - ever , such workers may alternatively have more to gain if those tools enhance their productivity and bargaining power . Relatedly , more companies might switch their codebases to programming languages where they know Codex could augment work . It is also important to note that use of Python is actively growing , in part because it is a dominant language used in educational contexts and because of its high readability factor . By increasing the amount that can be achieved with Python , Codex might make the engineering ﬁeld more ac - cessible to a wider variety of people , including those coming from a more diverse range of demographic backgrounds . H . 3 . Impacts on non - engineers Code generation tools could also widen the base of people who are able to move into programming or shift the distribu - tion of skills that new programmers need to learn ( Xu et al . , 2021 ) . One mechanism through which this may happen is that Codex may make it easier to work with new codebases or new languages . Code generation models may also make it simpler to build tools that automate repetitive tasks in non - engineering roles . H . 4 . Effects of differential package import rates Within a code ﬁle , one often imports packages or programs written by third parties . Rather than constantly reinventing the wheel , software developers rely on functions , libraries and APIs for most code we might consider “boilerplate . ” For any given task , though , there are multiple options : PyTorch or TensorFlow for machine learning , Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization , etc . Codex imports substitutable packages at different rates based on patterns in its training data , which can have various engineer roles while a 2020 survey of Python developers ( Python Software Foundation and JetBrains , 2020 ) suggests that those data science and analysis roles are some of the most common Python use cases . Given this , we might anticipate that women would be disproportionately affected – positively or negatively – by Codex . However , we emphasize that those surveys may not be representa - tive for various reasons ( e . g . selective participation of community members in the survey ; non - representativeness of the community as a sample of the overall developer and Python communities , respectively ) . We mention these results merely to illustrate the po - tential for code generation’s economic effects to be felt unequally across society and to motivate more rigorous research in related areas . possible implications . Differential import rates by Codex might lead to subtle errors in cases where a certain import is ill - advised , increase robustness in cases where the al - ternative package imported by an individual would have been worse , and / or increase the dominance of an already - inﬂuential set of individuals and organizations in the soft - ware supply chain . Despite many packages being free , there are clear rewards for developers and ﬁrms that have high - use packages , and free packages can be wrappers for paid prod - ucts . Thus , the patterns of importing in Codex and other code generation models could have substantial economic implications for those who build and maintain packages , as well as safety or security implications . 27 Many commonly used packages are fairly entrenched and there can be high switching costs . Using the same package as everyone else means one’s code will be more compatible ( if one uses a package everyone knows they will inherently understand one’s use of it ) , more trustworthy ( if one uses a package everyone already has installed they will not be afraid to install new things to run one’s code ) , and just generally work better with other code ( if one uses a package everyone uses , others will be a lot more able to run one’s code out of the box or plug it into their package ) . A given package might be dominant because it is the best available standard in terms of speed , security , or accessibility . Most of these packages are not paid , so the associated costs are mostly in learning to use new packages and the different trade - offs and syntax . The scale of these effects for Codex may be relatively low if users mostly import packages they know how to use or have done outside research on , so they can double - check anything the model does . Moreover , because packages are generally imported at the top of a ﬁle without any comments , the model has very little to go on in these cases , so users would most likely have to start typing out the name of the package they want to import rather than trusting the model to know they are starting a machine learning project and want to import either PyTorch or TensorFlow . Dependence on code generation models’ import suggestions may grow over time as users adapt to working with such systems . As users learn how to “prompt engineer” with Codex , they may use the model as a decision - making tool or search engine . Where a user may have done an Internet search before for “which machine learning package to use” or “pros and cons of PyTorch vs . Tensorﬂow” they might now just type “ # import machine learning package” and 27 As one example , we looked at completions of the prompt : # import machine learning package import and found that over 100 completions of 100 tokens , 6 contained suggestions for TensorFlow and 3 for PyTorch , two libraries that are rough substitutes . Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code trust Codex to do the rest . Users might be more inclined to accept the Codex answer under the assumption that the package it suggests is the one with which Codex will be more helpful . As a result , certain players might become more entrenched in the package market and Codex might not be aware of new packages developed after the training data was originally gathered . Further , for already existing packages , the model may make suggestions for deprecated methods . This could increase open - source developers’ in - centive to maintain backward compatibility , which could pose challenges given that open - source projects are often under - resourced ( Eghbal , 2020 ; Trinkenreich et al . , 2021 ) . More work is needed to compare the prevalence of different packages in Codex outputs with the input data to understand how or if these biases are concentrated by training , as well as to understand the direct and indirect impacts of these biases . H . 5 . Future directions Precise and accurate prediction of any impacts without user or market signal is difﬁcult , but the potential implications on the long - run labor market and the possibility of disparate outcomes across groups warrant further exploration of these issues . It may be possible to assess the relative likelihood of different scenarios by building a deeper understanding of Codex’s capabilities across several code - related tasks or by studying the effects of precise deployment scenarios . We plan to support research measuring Codex’s particular im - pact as well as research on code generation and automation more generally . We recommend future work focused on Codex models and other similar systems , with an eye towards positively inﬂu - encing both the deployment of such technologies and any other necessary steps by key actors such as governments . Some areas which we are particularly interested in seeing research include : • Measuring the economic value of generating faster and / or better code . This can include tracking the down - stream impacts of tools created with Codex , including those which may not have been possible to build previ - ously ( at all , or by speciﬁc individuals or teams ) . • Measuring changes in code documentation practices and testing as a result of Codex . Codex may make it easier to keep code well - documented , but it may also propagate subtle errors in documentation that lead to bugs downstream . Similarly , Codex can help people write tests for code , which can dramatically improve software quality and the surface area for costly down - stream bugs , but if engineers become overly reliant , they may not properly specify code . ( Planning , 2002 ; Jones & Bonsignour , 2011 ) . • Measuring the impact on worker productivity , quality of life , and wages of improved code generation tech - nologies . Most past studies of the impacts of code gen - eration models consider performance on a closed set of tasks in a simulated environment ( Xu et al . , 2021 ) . As the deployment of Codex and other near - term technolo - gies proceeds , we may be able to conduct more robust experiments examining the impact of various strengths of models on real - world job performance , across teams and across ﬁrms . • Measuring the ability of Codex and other code gener - ation models to reduce barriers to entry for the ﬁeld . Such work could explore various ways in which the educational and career progression of programmers and engineers could be inﬂuenced by the availability of powerful code generation technologies . More broadly , we believe the ﬁndings in this paper and future research on code generation might encourage re - searchers and policymakers to update their views regarding the potential for AI to have substitutive effects on workers in various high - skill domains in the future . As capabilities improve , the effects of this class of technologies could be substantial and more study is needed both on the effects and on appropriate responses .
