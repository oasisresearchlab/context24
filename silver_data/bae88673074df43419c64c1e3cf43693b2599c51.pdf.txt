Open data in digital strategies against COVID - 19 : the case of Belgium Robert Viseur University of Mons robert . viseur @ umons . ac . be ABSTRACT COVID - 19 has highlighted the importance of digital in the fight against the pandemic ( control at the border , automated tracing , creation of databases . . . ) . In this research , we analyze the Belgian response in terms of open data . First , we examine the open data publication strategy in Belgium ( a federal state with a sometimes complex functioning , especially in health ) , second , we conduct a case study ( anatomy of the pandemic in Belgium ) in order to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the main COVID - 19 open data repository . And third , we analyze the obstacles to open data publication . Finally , we discuss the Belgian COVID - 19 open data strategy in terms of data availability , data relevance and knowledge management . In particular , we show how difficult it is to optimize the latter in order to make the best use of governmental , private and academic open data in a way that has a positive impact on public health policy .

This 2019 coronavirus disease ( or COVID - 19 ) led to the strict confinement of Wuhan City by January 23 , 2020 and most major cities in Hubei by January 24 [ 17 ] . Although locally effective , these confinement measures did not prevent the disease from spreading to mainland China and several dozen other countries , leading the WHO to declare the COVID - 19 epidemic a pandemic on March 11 , 2020 . In Europe , the disease hit Italy hard .

In Belgium , confinement was imposed as of March 18 , 2020 , while a second confinement was implemented as of November 2 , 2020 after a relaxation of the measures during the summer vacations . Digital technology was part of the arsenal of responses to fight the spread of the virus [ 34 ] : profiling of citizens at the borders , identification of contact cases ( tracing ) , cluster analysis , development of big open data . . . In this difficult health context , some countries published open data related to the COVID - 19 as from the first weeks of the pandemic [ 23 ] . Open data was also quickly pointed out as a necessary tool to monitor and anticipate the spread of the virus [ 35 ] . The unavailability of open data in Belgium was identified at the beginning of the pandemic as a hindrance to the work of scientists 1 . The publication of open data files is the responsibility of Sciensano , a public institution created on February 25 , 2018 . The unavailability of certain raw data has led to protests from the academic world , sometimes relayed by the press or by elected officials 2 . Among the academic relays , let’s mention Bernard Rentier ( see Figure 1 ) a Bel - gian virologist , former rector of the University of Liège and active promoter of open access policies : “Very bad news , the ( hopefully temporary ) closure of the excellent @ Covidata . be , exasperated by the lack of transparency on # Covid _ 19 information in Belgium . Beware : opacity is the main stimulus for conspiracy theorists ” 3 . However , over time , these open data have proven their usefulness , such as the French website covidtracker . fr , developed by Guillaume Rozier ( and linked to the popular service ViteMaDose ) . In this article , we propose to draw up an inventory of open data on COVID - 19 in Belgium , to identify the uses and the obstacles to reuse , and finally to analyze the available data sets . To do so , we rely on a case study ( anatomy of the pandemic in Belgium ) based on published data . Our article is divided into four parts . The first part is dedicated to the review of the literature and will be followed by the presentation of the methodology . The third part , divided into three sub - parts , is devoted to the presentation of the results . The fourth part is committed to the discussion of the results . 1 Cf . https : / / www . rtbf . be / info / belgique / detail _ quand - le - federal - refuse - d - ouvrir - les - donnees - sur - l - epidemie - de - coronavirus - un - probleme - majeur - qui - retarde - les - scientifiques ? id = 10466339 2 Cf . http : / / margauxdere . be / pourquoi - lopen - data - est - important - pour - vaincre - la - covid - 19 / or the Twitter account of the Hainaut deputy Catherine Fonck ( former doctor ) 3 Cf . https : / / twitter . com / bernardrentier / status / 1347839421899550721 OpenSym 2021 , September 15 – 17 , 2021 , Online , Spain Robert Viseur Figure 1 : Relay of a tweet in support of the Belgian site covidata . be 2 STATE OF THE ART 2 . 1 Open data The term “open data” refers to “ information that has been made technically and legally available for reuse ” ( 19 ) . Data release in the public sector is motivated by transparency ( e . g . , budget analysis ) and the belief that data , like software , are “ public goods ” ( [ 3 ] ; [ 19 ] ) . This practice can also facilitate data sharing between public or - ganizations , foster the emergence of new applications useful to citizens ( e . g . , public transportation ) , or improve data quality and enrichment through crowdsourcing initiatives ( [ 3 ] ; [ 8 ] ; [ 19 ] ; [ 20 ] ) . Huijboom and Van den Broek [ 15 ] , for their part , distinguish 3 generic strategies : improving democratic control and representa - tion ; strengthening policing and law enforcement ; and product and service innovation . The authors show different strategic ori - entations between states and a more or less pronounced focus in different cases . Open data initiatives in the European public sec - tor are promoted by European Directives such as PSI ( 2003 / 98 / EC ) or INSPIRE ( 2007 / 2 / EC ) . Several initiatives are already popular in the UK , the US , France or Brazil ( e . g . data . gov . uk , thedatahub . org , data . gov , data . gouv . fr , data - publica . com , www . dados . gov . br . . . ) ( [ 3 ] ; [ 2 ] ) . Nikiforova [ 23 ] conducted an early analysis of open data poli - cies related to COVID - 19 . The results showed that 32 out of 52 national open data portals were publishing such open data while Austria , France , Switzerland , and the US were the most responsive in publishing open data within the first two weeks of the pandemic . These open data can in practice feed into open science initiatives [ 11 ] . For example , in the spirit of reproducible research , an epidemi - ological model is described in a publication accompanied by an open source implementation and open data inputs and results . 2 . 2 Database Organizations are required to build databases and operate them as part of a decision - making process [ 36 ] . In the case of COVID - 19 , the organizations involved are those involved in the state health response and must make decisions ( e . g . , confinement decision and configuration of confinement policy based on hospital congestion status and the extent of virus circulation ) . In this context , the value of the information will depend on the use made of it and will gener - ally decrease over time . This information is actually a representation of the reality in which we are interested . The representations will be built from a set of signals supposed to translate the states of the real world through an information function [ 36 ] . These rep - resentations are materialized by the data present in the database . These data are subsequently transformed into information through Figure 2 : Data valuation process ( adapted from Reix et al . , 2011 ) an interpretation process . This process is based on pre - existing knowledge ( in particular the interpretative model used ) . The use of information leads to results , which are sources of learning and new knowledge , allowing not only the interpretation of data but also their selection during acquisition ( filtering ) . This process , described by Reix et al . ( 2011 ) , is shown in Figure 2 . It is also described , in a more popular form , as the DIKW pyramid [ 10 ] : Data , Information , Knowledge and Wisdom . In this form , data are described as facts , raw materials , that have been accumulated over time “ by people or by machines from observation ” 4 . Information is well - formed data to which meaning has been added . Knowledge involves data , meaning and practice . It is “ a resource for an entity’s ability to act effectively ” . Wisdom is “ the ability to make optimal use of knowledge to establish and achieve desired goals ” . It can be individual ( competence ) or organizational ( capacity ) . The latter can be related to absorptive capacities [ 36 ] or to the dynamic capacities dear to Teece [ 33 ] . 2 . 3 Relevance of data Organizations therefore make decisions based on representations of reality ( e . g . , management dashboard ) . Are these representations “ relevant ” ? Therelevanceof representationsreferstotheiruse . What is relevant is “ what is appropriate , what is suitable for action ” . In other words , data are useful when they lead to individual and collec - tive wisdom . Relevance is therefore “ a quality relative to a user and a context of use ” [ 36 ] . Several quality criteria are used to judge the relevance of representations . Reix et al . ( 2011 ) cite three main ones : 4 Translations from references in French are made by the author Open data in digital strategies against COVID - 19 : the case of Belgium OpenSym 2021 , September 15 – 17 , 2021 , Online , Spain completeness , accuracy , and degree of finesse . The quality of com - pleteness refers to the completeness of the representation : all signif - icant changes of state of reality are covered by the representations ( first order risk ) . The accuracy quality refers to the absence of noise : the representations should ideally avoid the second kind of risk related to the taking into account of events caused by random variations due to imperfections of the information function . The degree of finesse concerns the precision of the representation , i . e . its level of detail or its range of variation . In addition , according to Reix et al ( 2011 ) , there is the punctuality ( respect of deadlines ) , the reliability ( confidence in the source ) , the form ( data , drawings , still or animated images . . . ) and the accessibility ( search and access methods ) . 3 METHODOLOGY AND DATA The Google search engine was used , on the one hand , to identify open data sources related to COVID - 19 in Belgium , on the other hand , to identify press articles dealing with open data . In the first case , the queries open data " covid - 19 " site : be and " open data " " covid - 19 " site : be were used . In the second case , the reference news site RTBF Info was targeted using the " open data " " covid - 19 " site : rtbf . be query . Only articles discussing the Belgian open data policy COVID - 19 were taken . In particular , RTBF articles simply relaying pandemic figures based on Sciensano open data as part of their information mission were not taken into account . Seven articles developing criticisms on the Belgian open data strategy were thus retained . The case study was based on the data provided by the govern - mental reference sites Sciensano and Stabel as well as on the data provided by Google on mobility . The open source software Libre - Office . org Calc ( spreadsheet ) and R ( statistics ) were used to process this data . 4 RESULTS : COVID - 19 OPEN DATA IN BELGIUM 4 . 1 Data sources The unavailability of open data in Belgium was identified at the beginning of the pandemic as an obstacle to the work of scientists 5 . The publication of open data files is the responsibility of Sciensano , a public institution created on February 25 , 2018 and the result of the merger between the former “ Centre d’Études et de Recherches Vétérinaires et Agrochimiques ” ( CERVA ) and the former Scientific Institute of Public Health ( ISP ) . In practice , the data were published until now in PDF format , which did not allow easy processing in spreadsheet or statistical software . Note that open data are classically published on different portals reflecting the institutional structure of the country . The federal level proposes the portal Data . fgov . be publishing its own data and referencing data from other portals . Other important por - tals include the portal of the federal statistical institute Statbel , the WalStat portal of the Walloon statistical institute IWEPS and the ODWB portal of the Wallonia - Brussels Federation ( FWB ) . In practice , the federal portal provides a central view of the characteristics of the datasets made available in open data on its 5 Cf . https : / / www . rtbf . be / info / belgique / detail _ quand - le - federal - refuse - d - ouvrir - les - donnees - sur - l - epidemie - de - coronavirus - un - probleme - majeur - qui - retarde - les - scientifiques ? id = 10466339 Datasets page . We can see that a large set of formats is supported with a predominance of CSV ( textual tabular data ) , WMS ( image format for maps ) and JSON ( serialization format used by web de - velopers ) . As for the licenses , they reflect the importance of the referenced datasets : Open Data License Flanders for the Flemish portal , Statbel Open License for Statbel , Etalab Open License for the City of Brussels . . . As for Sciensano , it publishes its raw data , notably relating to COVID - 19 6 , on a separate site . The license of the data does not appear clearly on the Epistat site but appears 7 on the FAIR site ( Open Data Commons Attribution License ) . The supported formats are CSV and JSON for the specific data ( number of deaths , number of hospitalizations , number of confirmed cases . . . ) and XLS ( default format for older versions of Microsoft Excel ) for the complete tabular dataset . Although proprietary and supplanted by more recent formats ( ODS , XLSX . . . ) , the XLS format is still fre - quently used because it is widely supported as an import or export format for many software programs on the market . 4 . 2 Reuse of data These data are important for several reasons . First , they meet com - munication needs , particularly in the media , in order to explain the characteristics of the pandemic in a more pedagogical way . This is notably the work done by Covidata , an initiative covering a group of researchers proposing analyses and graphics under a CC0 license ( CreativeCommons public domain license ) accompanied by a set of open source creation scripts published on Github 8 ( see Figure 3 for an example of a visualization superimposing the first and second waves with curfew and confinement dates ) . Secondly , beyond visualization , they feed into the creation of indicators to better understand the evolution of the pandemic , pos - sibly by combining Sciensano data with data provided by other organizations such as Statbel . We develop an example in section 4 . 3 . There we present a COVID - 19 excess mortality index by comparing the proportion of deaths per age group and per region and the respective importance of each age group in the population of each region ( see Table 1 ) , which makes it possible to highlight an excess mortality in Wallonia and , above all , Brussels compared to Flanders that cannot be explained by the difference in population density alone . Thirdly , open data facilitate the development of simulation mod - els that allow a better understanding , and therefore anticipation , of the dynamics of the pandemic at a local level . Nicolas Vandewalle , Professor at the University of Liège , has developed a SEIR model , published on Github 9 , which allows to visualize the evolution of the pandemic and to anticipate the saturation of intensive care units , thus providing a tool for decision support ( e . g . confinement ) . 4 . 3 Case study The case study proposed here consists of an analysis of the COVID - 19 pandemic in Belgium with a specific focus on regional differences . Belgium is indeed a federal state .

In practice , Sciensano provides its data in the form of text files in CSV format or workbooks in Microsoft Excel format ( see Figure 4 ) . A file containing all the data sets is provided in the latter for - mat . This is the file we work on ( dated November 11 , 2020 ) . These datasets are provided with documentation on the semantics of the data 10 . The data are generally structured along different dimensions : region , province , city , age ( range ) , gender . . . The data are of course aggregated , without personal data . The values provided concern the number of deaths , hospitalizations , patients in intensive care and tests . These files are therefore designed to be easily processed from specific software ( e . g . reading CSV files from a Python script ) or 10 Cf . https : / / epistat . sciensano . be / COVID19BE _ codebook . pdf Open data in digital strategies against COVID - 19 : the case of Belgium OpenSym 2021 , September 15 – 17 , 2021 , Online , Spain Figure 5 : Excess mortality related to the COVID - 19 pandemic in Belgium Table 2 : Excess mortality by age group and region Age Flanders Wallonia Brussels 25 - 44 - 43 , 45 % 19 , 42 % 137 , 26 % 45 - 64 - 45 , 96 % 38 , 76 % 149 , 15 % 65 - 74 - 36 , 63 % 33 , 36 % 156 , 11 % 75 - 84 - 26 , 48 % 29 , 64 % 114 , 69 % 85 + - 20 , 28 % 24 , 04 % 69 , 52 % from standard spreadsheet software using pivot tables or standard functions ( NB . SI , SUM . SI . . . ) . An open source spreadsheet program such as LibreOffice . org Calc allows for example to easily calculate mortality by age group as well as cumulative mortality starting from the oldest population ( see Table 1 ) . To visualize the existence of excess mortality in the year 2020 during which the pandemic occurred , one has to use the Statbel 11 data provided for the period 2009 - 2021 , which allows to visualize the excess mortality in 2020 during successive waves ( cf . Figure 5 ) . These data are also exploited by Sciensano in the Be - MOMO 12 project , for the analysis of excess mortality due to COVID - 19 and the validation of the methodology for calculating mortality due to COVID - 19 ( 31 ) . The data provided allow the same calculation to be performed by region so as to determine mortality at the national and regional levels ( Flanders , Brussels , and Wallonia ) . However , the comparison is not so simple . Indeed , these regions present distinct realities , 11 Cf . https : / / statbel . fgov . be / fr / open - data / nombre - de - deces - par - jour - sexe - arrondissement - age 12 Cf . https : / / epistat . wiv - isp . be / momo / notably demographic 13 , and we have just seen ( Table 1 ) that the older populations paid the major part of the price in this pandemic . Thanks to the official Statbel website , it is possible to know the population part ( % ) by age group and by region . From this , it is possible to calculate the excess mortality per age group by dividing the share of COVID - 19 deaths and the share of living persons by age group and region ( see Table 2 ) . This calculation ( i . e . the ratio , for a given province and age group , between the percentage of COVID - 19 deaths and the percentage of this sub - population in the general population ) shows a high under - mortality in Flanders , given the greater age of the population in the north of the country . Several factors could explain this excess mortality , such as popu - lation density and poverty level . The standard of living , in terms of per capita income , is indeed higher in Flanders 14 . Wallonia , for example , has a high level of unemployment 15 and a lower average per capita GDP ( Gross Domestic Product ) in its former industrial 13 Cf . https : / / statbel . fgov . be / sites / default / files / images / in % 20de % 20kijker / Chiffrescles _ 2019 _ r . pdf , ( see page 14 for a breakdown by age group ) 14 Cf . https : / / www . iweps . be / indicateur - statistique / revenus - menages - habitant / for a comparison between regions 15 Cf . https : / / www . iweps . be / indicateur - statistique / taux - de - chomage - administratif - 15 - a - 64 - ans / OpenSym 2021 , September 15 – 17 , 2021 , Online , Spain Robert Viseur Table 3 : Linear regression in R Figure 6 : Hospitalization figures ( actual vs regression ) area ( Mons - Charleroi - Liège axis ) [ 5 ] , while Brussels , although gen - erating a per capita GDP well above the European average [ 5 ] , is fed by Walloon and Flemish commuters who work but do not re - side in Brussels 16 , and has a fairly poor population 17 on average , particularly as a result of immigration [ 25 ] . Several useful data can be retrieved in this respect : GDP per capita ( e . g . IWEPS and Stat - bel ) , income per region ( Statbel ) or specific poverty indicators ( e . g . AROPE provided by Statbel ) . The correlation between per capita income and hospitalization rate , by province , appears to be higher ( than that with AROPE or density : - 0 . 930 vs . 0 . 823 vs . 0 . 637 ) , so per capita income is used to run a linear regression to predict the hospitalization rate . The latter is used instead of mortality because , at the time of this case ( November 2020 ) , mortality by province was not provided , unlike hospitalization figures . The regression model here consists of predicting the excess hospitalization ( share of hospitalizations divided by the share of the province’s population in the total population ) by per capita income . The model provides 16 Cf . https : / / ibsa . brussels / sites / default / files / publication / documents / FOR _ HermReg _ 2020 _ 12182 _ F . pdf ( page 52 et following ) 17 Cf . https : / / statbel . fgov . be / fr / themes / menages / revenus - fiscaux a satisfactory estimate ( see Figure 6 ) : the variable " RHab " is signifi - cant and the model has a coefficient of determination R 2 equal to 0 . 8496 ( see Table 3 ) . The data provided allow for the exploration of other hypotheses ( e . g . , testing policy ; the latter is found to be fairly uniform across the country , for example , regardless of the density of the provinces considered ) . Other open data can be used , including those provided by private providers such as Google ( see Google’s " COVID - 19 Com - munity Mobility Reports " available for download in CSV format ) . The latter allow for the analysis of the evolution of mobility related to leisure activities ( e . g . , increased mobility to the coast during the spring or summer vacations , including the July 21 festivities ; see Figure 7 ) or to work activities ( e . g . , effectiveness of the confinement and reduction of commuting in Brussels ) . 4 . 4 Criticism of the open data strategy Sciensano’s open data policy has been criticized since the beginning of the crisis by prominent French - speaking Belgian personalities such as Bernard Rentier , university pro - rector and promoter of Open data in digital strategies against COVID - 19 : the case of Belgium OpenSym 2021 , September 15 – 17 , 2021 , Online , Spain Figure 7 : Overmobility at the Belgian coast ( summer 2020 ) Figure 8 : Open data publication process open science , Pierre Schauss , professor of computer science at the initiative of covidata . be , or Marius Gilbert , epidemiologist : “ The scientific community does not currently have access to the raw data concerning covid - 19 . This is a major problem that delays us in the answers that can be given to this epidemic . We urgently need to move to open data as Italy and France are doing ” 18 . Basically , Sciensano is mandated to provide data to public authorities . These early complaints led to the publication of data in open data by the end of March 2020 ( the data was then communicated during press conferences or within PDF files that were difficult to process in an automated way ) . However , tensions with scientists continued until the covidata . be website was temporarily closed in January 2021 in protest against the increasing share of data released outside of open data repositories 19 ( a form allows access to sensitive data within three weeks ) . As Simon Dellicour , an epidemiologist , put it : “ the fact that in Belgium a very small part of the scientific community has access to all epidemiological data is unjustifiable and non - strategic in terms of missed analytical opportunities ” ( idem ) . 18 Cf . https : / / www . rtbf . be / info / belgique / detail _ quand - le - federal - refuse - d - ouvrir - les - donnees - sur - l - epidemie - de - coronavirus - un - probleme - majeur - qui - retarde - les - scientifiques ? id = 10466339 19 Cf . https : / / www . rtbf . be / info / societe / detail _ open - data - et - sciensano - manque - de - coherence - entre - le - discours - officiel - et - la - realite ? id = 10668706 As another example , vaccination data were not released until the end of April 2021 20 . In addition to scientists ( e . g . , studying the effect of returning from vacation ) , these data are also of interest to journalists for their news and dashboards on the evolution of the pandemic ( e . g . , explaining the reasons for confinement measures to the population ) . Sciensano , on the other hand , points to the workload required to make the collected data available in open data , citing a shortage of 45 people to handle the additional workflow 21 . The difficulty is found at two levels : at the level of the organization itself and at the level of the organization . On the one hand , the collection of data from different sources entails a lot of work to consolidate a network of data collection , to integrate these data and to ensure quality assurance , in particular to validate the published data ( cf . Figure 8 ) : “ It would not have been responsible to throw the data away ” ( idem ) . 20 Cf . https : / / www . rtbf . be / info / societe / detail _ campagne - de - vaccination - contre - le - covid - 19 - le - point - en - chiffres - et - graphiques - ce - dimanche - 16 - mai ? id = 10730805 21 Cf . https : / / www . rtbf . be / info / belgique / detail _ sciensano - notre - premiere - preoccupation - n - etait - pas - de - faire - un - beau - site - internet - en - open - data ? id = 10509727 OpenSym 2021 , September 15 – 17 , 2021 , Online , Spain Robert Viseur Table 4 : COVID - 19 datasets in open data and by type of source Government open data ( examples ) Private open data ( examples ) Scientific open data ( examples ) Federal Sciensano ( Epistat , FAIR Healthdata ) , Statbel 25 COVID - 19 Community Mobility Reports ( Google ) Covidata . be ( open science : open data + open source ) Region AVIQ ( vaccination statistics in Wallonia 26 Community Open Data Wallonie Bruxelles Province - Municipality - On the other hand , data published in open data must be anonymized ( e . g . , aggregated ) and its irreversibility must be guaranteed 22 . 5 DISCUSSION 5 . 1 Characterization of the data sets The open data identified in this work ( see Table 4 ) are of different natures : either governmental data or private data ( made available following the pandemic in the case of Google ) , or academic data ( sometimes in an open science context mobilizing data but also software ) . The governmental data reflect the Belgian institutional structure but the data specific to the COVID - 19 pandemic are for - tunately centralized by a unique organization ( Sciensano ) resulting in frequent redirections to Sciensano from other data sources . On the licensing side , there are several cases available . In particu - lar , in the case of Sciensano , some of the data is provided on the site under a public domain license while other data is provided upon request : “ Since 31 March 2020 , Sciensano has made daily updated data publicly available . Obtaining access to additional data other than these public ( open ) data is subject to at least : Compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) and the Belgian Law of 30 July 2018 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data ( including combined datasets consisting partly of personal data and partly of non - personal data ) ; Obtaining authorization of the Information Security Committee , if health data are concerned ” . 5 . 2 Relevance of the representations Published data raise questions about their relevance ( cf . 3 . 2 ) in the sense of Reix et al . ( 2011 ) . The following is a set of potential problems observed following the use of these data or the monitoring carried out on the subject of the use of COVID - 19 open data . Accessibility - Some data are not available in open data ( e . g . , delays in the availability of vaccination figures in Belgium ( and France ) , added by Sciensano on April 27 , 2020 . This same obser - vation could be made for the dissemination of wastewater data ( cf . Obépine network for example in France ) . Moreover , some data have been published , but in PDF format , which has handicapped the automated processing on these data . 22 Cf . https : / / www . rtbf . be / info / article / detail _ de - sciensano - aux - sites - d - infos - en - passant - par - sydney - comment - les - chiffres - du - covid - arrivent - jusqu - a - vous ? id = 10717592 23 Cf . https : / / statbel . fgov . be / fr / covid - 19 - donnees - statbel 24 Cf . https : / / www . jemevaccine . be / centre - d - informations / un - portail - opendata - vaccination - est - cree - avec - les - chiffres - de - la - vaccination - par - commune - en - wallonie / ) Accuracy - Test data are affected by the testing techniques that are or are not accounted for ( e . g . RT - PCR , antigenic and salivary ) in the statistics , which makes comparisons between states or over long periods of time ( change of accounting ) more complex . In practice , in Belgium , the calculation of the number of cases or the number of tests follows specific rules that Sciensano documents 25 . For example , before March 15 , 2020 , confirmed cases were in practice , and due to the shortage of tests , possible cases ; thereafter , they were cases confirmed by a molecular test ( i . e . PCR or rapid antigen test ) 26 . Salivary tests , although considered interesting by Sciensano , are therefore not counted 27 . Similarly , the way in which COVID - 19 deaths are counted may vary by country and , as in Belgium , may deviate from WHO recommendations [ 22 ] . Reliability - Positivity figures should be taken with caution when shortages occur [ 24 ] . For example , testing may be prioritized in at - risk or highly symptomatic populations , resulting in higher pos - itivity . Catch - up effects may also occur in the publication of data , leading to upward or downward discontinuities that are not attrib - utable to the observed phenomenon . Completeness - The effects of confinement measures ( e . g . mental health ; see [ 26 ] , on this topic of mental health ) are not included in the statistics provided . In addition , data on the use of proxim - ity tracing applications are , as in other countries [ 34 ] , not public ( Belgium ) . Fineness - Data are not always provided with the expected gran - ularity ( e . g . data by region and not by province in some Sciensano files ) but this can be improved over time . Timeliness - Data are sometimes provided with a delay ( e . g . week - end ) that disturbs visualization or prediction model results . This problem also exists in Belgium for the monitoring of variants 28 . Punctuality - Sciensano data for Saturday , Sunday and Monday are provided on Tuesday 29 . Form - The processing of open data leads to the creation of new open data as well as to visualizations that facilitate communication around the pandemic ( e . g . covidata . be ) . Graphics can pose different problems ( e . g . scale ) . 25 Cf . https : / / epistat . sciensano . be / COVID19BE _ codebook . pdf and https : / / covid - 19 . sciensano . be / sites / default / files / Covid19 / COVID - 19 _ FAQ _ FR _ final . pdf 26 Cf . https : / / covid - 19 . sciensano . be / sites / default / files / Covid19 / 20201012 _ Advice % 20RAG _ testing _ update % 20October _ Fr . pdf 27 Cf . https : / / covid - 19 . sciensano . be / sites / default / files / Covid19 / 20201012 _ Advice % 20RAG _ testing _ update % 20October _ Fr . pdf 28 This information has for example been added to the open data downloadable in France , cf . https : / / www . data . gouv . fr / fr / datasets / donnees - de - laboratoires - pour - le - depistage - indicateurs - sur - les - variants / 29 Cf . https : / / www . rtbf . be / info / societe / detail _ coronavirus - en - belgique - sciensano - ne - publiera - plus - de - bilan - du - coronavirus - les - week - ends - et - le - lundi ? id = 10525696 Open data in digital strategies against COVID - 19 : the case of Belgium OpenSym 2021 , September 15 – 17 , 2021 , Online , Spain Figure 9 : Pandemic response and knowledge management 5 . 3 Knowledge management As emphasized by Rowe et al . [ 29 ] , the effectiveness of the organized responseto theCOVID - 19pandemicdependsonthe managementof knowledge about the virus to allow for the adequacy and adaptation of measures taken . Thus , the mechanisms of transmission of the virus are the subject of a continuous work of updating of knowledge . In contrast to SARS [ 13 ] , the importance of presymptomatic persons ( persons infected without symptoms during the incubation period but symptomatic beyond that period ) in the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , which accounts for more than forty percent of infections , has rapidly emerged ( [ 13 ] ; [ 32 ] ; [ 18 ] ) . On the contrary , the role of asymptomatic persons ( infected persons with no symptoms ) , about fifteen percent of the patients [ 14 ] , in the chain of infection may have been downplayed over time ( [ 21 ] ; [ 4 ] ) . As for the modes of transmission of the virus , while there is a general consensus on direct or indirect contact ( fomite ) and droplets , the possible contribution of aerosols ( particles between 5 and 20 µ m in size ) to airborne transmission was still being debated in March 2021 ( [ 12 ] ; [ 18 ] ) , although this scientific debate does not negate the importance of improving ventilation in enclosed spaces , for example [ 1 ] . This evolving nature of knowledge in the face of a new phenome - non implies continuous monitoring and consolidation of knowledge to enable decision - making in the various dimensions of action in the face of the pandemic [ 34 ] ( see Figure 9 ) . This characteristic also influences the reuse of open data . For example , in the case of models , their execution assumes the availability of relevant data to feed them but also of up - to - date knowledge to configure them , knowledge itself sometimes resulting from a process of progres - sive data refinement ( cf . DIKW model ; [ 10 ] ) . Thus , for example , in a model taking into account the diffusion of the virus , the share of contaminations due to presymtomatics must be known and ad - justed as soon as the scientific consensus is established or evolves . Similarly , the rate of vaccination , the importance of herd immunity or the importance of immune escape [ 16 ] will influence the work of modelers , and presupposes both up - to - date knowledge and the availability of quality raw data . 5 . 4 Comparison with France The French situation with regard to the processing of COVID - 19 data is also beginning to be documented . Ronai [ 27 ] attributes the French delays in publishing complete mortality data to technical and organizational problems . The author distinguishes between a statistically oriented information system , with an administrative channel ( INSERM ) and a health channel ( INSEE ) , and a real time information system ( SI - VIC ) . The latter , initially deployed to record the victims of the Paris attacks of November 2015 , was eventu - ally used for real - time monitoring of COVID - 19 - related mortality . Initially , it only counted deaths that occurred in hospital and ex - cluded deaths at home or in retirement homes ( i . e . 44 % of COVID - 19 deaths 30 . The latter could finally be counted via a fourth system ( Voozanoo ) dedicated to EHPADs . The data are therefore parti - tioned between different systems and must be consolidated before publication . Under pressure from groups of data scientists , such as OpenCOVID19 , SantéPubliqueFrance will gradually open up its data sets from March 18 , 2020 ( [ 7 ] ; [ 27 ] ) . This will allow several high - profile initiatives to be launched ( e . g . CovidTracker ) . For ex - ample , statistics on hospitalizations according to vaccination status were only published by DREES in August 2021 ( the breakdown of these data by age group is announced for later ) , whereas the vaccination campaign started in France on 27 December 2020 31 . They thus required the merging of data from SI - VIC ( hospitaliza - tion ) , SI - DEP ( screening ) and VAC - SI ( vaccination ) 32 . No matter how much professionals may want to , the production of real - time data sets and dashboards for evidence - based decision - making is not immediate . 6 CONCLUSION In this exploratory research , we analyzed the open data policy implemented in Belgium . We described the available datasets as well as the applications to which these datasets had led . Based on a case study and a review of press articles , we showed the current limitations of Belgian open data in terms of the relevance of the published data . This research is currently limited to one country ( Belgium ) . It should be extended to other neighboring countries , which would allow a comparison of publication policies , for example between Belgium and France , which is close to Belgium and is rather among the good students in terms of open data [ 23 ] , despite the criticisms expressed by the most active reusers 33 . 30 Cf . https : / / www . lemonde . fr / les - decodeurs / article / 2020 / 12 / 03 / les - residents - d - ehpad - representent - 44 - des - morts - du - covid - 19 _ 6062084 _ 4355770 . html ) 31 Cf . https : / / www . santepubliquefrance . fr / dossiers / coronavirus - covid - 19 / vaccination - contre - la - covid - 19 32 Cf . https : / / data . drees . solidarites - sante . gouv . fr / explore / dataset / covid - 19 - resultats - issus - des - appariements - entre - si - vic - si - dep - et - vac - si / information / ? disjunctive . vac _ statut 33 Frenchman Guillaume Rozier , developer of CovidTracker and promoter of open data , thus regularly communicates about the slow pace of data communication ( e . g . variant figures ) .

OpenSym 2021 , September 15 – 17 , 2021 , Online , Spain Robert Viseur The understanding of the seemingly more important obstacles to the publication of open data in Belgium would merit further investigation in order to distinguish , and weigh up , cultural , legal , organizational and technical causes . This research could be done through a set of semi - structured interviews in organizations active in health , including IT development structures ( e . g . SMALS ) and institutions dedicated to public health ( e . g . Sciensano ) . REFERENCES [ 1 ] Bhagat , R . K . , Wykes , M . D . , Dalziel , S . B . , & Linden , P . F . ( 2020 ) .
