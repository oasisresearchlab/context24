Since 2003 , we have performed molecular analyses in a large series of patients with DS , 27 % of whom were negative for mutations or rearrangements in SCN1A . In order to identify new genes responsible for the disorder in the SCN1A - negative patients , 41 probands were screened for micro - rearrangements with Illumina high - density SNP microarrays . A hemizygous deletion on chromosome Xq22 . 1 , encompassing the PCDH19 gene , was found in one male patient . To confirm that PCDH19 is responsible for a Dravet - like syndrome , we sequenced its coding region in 73 additional SCN1A - negative patients . Nine different point mutations ( four missense and five truncating mutations ) were identified in 11 unrelated female patients . In addition , we demonstrated that the fibroblasts of our male patient were mosaic for the PCDH19 deletion . Patients with PCDH19 and SCN1A mutations had very similar clinical features including the association of early febrile and afebrile seizures , seizures occurring in clusters , developmental and language delays , behavioural disturbances , and cognitive regression . There were , however , slight but constant differences in the evolution of the patients , including fewer polymorphic seizures ( in particular rare myoclonic jerks and atypical absences ) in those with PCDH19 mutations . These results suggest that PCDH19 plays a major role in epileptic encephalopathies , with a clinical spectrum overlapping that of DS . This disorder mainly affects females . The identification of an affected mosaic male strongly supports the hypothesis that cellular interference is the pathogenic mechanism .

This heterogeneous group of disorders has multiple aetiologies such as symptomatic brain lesions , metabolic causes and diverse genetic syndromes . Much progress has been made in the past few years in the identification of genes responsible for genetic infantile epileptic encephalopathies . Among the genetic syndromes that have been characterized are : Dravet syndrome ( DS ) , also called severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy ( SMEI , MIM # 607208 ) [ 1 ] , CDKL5 / STK9 Rett - like epileptic encephalopathy [ 2 , 3 ] , ARX - related epileptic encephalopathies [ 4 ] , SRPX2 - related rolandic epilepsy associated with oral and speech dyspraxia and mental retardation [ 5 ] , and very recently , female - limited epilepsy and cognitive impairment ( EFMR ) associated with mutations in PCDH19 , the gene encoding the protocadherin 19 on the X chromosome [ 6 ] . Dravet syndrome is characterized by the occurrence of generalized or unilateral clonic or tonic – clonic seizures , usually triggered by fever , in the first year of life of a previously normal infant . Later on , other types of seizures occur , including myoclonus , atypical absences and partial seizures [ 7 ] . Develop - PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 1 February 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 2 | e1000381 ment is progressively delayed starting from the second year . Susceptibility to febrile seizures persists over time , and status epilepticus is frequent . Epilepsy generally persists despite appropri - ate anti - epileptic therapy ( polytherapy including sodium valproate , clobazam or topiramate and stiripentol ) . Children with DS typically have poorly developed language and motor skills , learning disabilities and variable degrees of mental retardation [ 8 ] . They are usually sporadic cases ; however , sib pairs with SMEI , or patients with a family history of epilepsy , have occasionally been reported [ 9 ] . Heterozygous de novo mutations in SCN1A , the gene encoding the voltage - gated neuronal sodium channel alpha 1 subunit ( Nav1 . 1 ) , are a major cause of DS [ 1 ] . All types of mutations [ 10 ] and rearrangements [ 11 – 15 ] in SCN1A have been observed in SMEI patients . However , no point mutations or rearrangements have been found in a fraction of patients , now estimated to 20 – 25 % [ 15 – 18 ] , strongly suggesting that DS is a genetically heterogeneous disorder . Our aim was to identify the gene ( s ) involved in SCN1A - negative patients with Dravet syndrome . Most of our patients were isolated , excluding the use of classical genetic approaches . Our hypothesis was that genomic micro - rearrangements , which are increasingly identified as causes of human genetic disorders , might be found in a subset of the SCN1A - negative patients with DS , thus identifying new causal genes . In this study , we have searched for genomic rearrangements in 41 SCN1A - negative patients using high - density SNP microarrays ( Illumina , 370K ) . Genes located in the rearrangements were then considered to be candidate genes and were analysed for point mutations by direct sequencing in the remaining negative patients with DS . Results Microarray - Based Identification of a De Novo Deletion on Chromosome Xq22 . 1 Encompassing PCDH19 An initial series of 41 probands ( 18 females and 23 males ) , referred for genetic analysis of Dravet syndrome but negative for point mutation and intragenic rearrangement of SCN1A [ 15 ] , was screened for genomic rearrangement using Illumina 370CNV microarrays . A hemizygous deletion on chromosome Xq22 . 1 was identified in a male patient ( patient 1 from family 1 ) . This deletion spanned approximately 1 Mb and encompassed a single gene , PCDH19 ( Figure 1A ) . A duplication of the same region was previously reported in one of 776 healthy controls ( 506 unrelated healthy individuals from Northern Germany and 270 HapMap subjects ) [ 19 ] , but no deletions in healthy individuals have been recorded in the database of genomic variants . Patient 1 and his mother were then analyzed with high - resolution CGH arrays ( Nimblegen ) . This analysis confirmed that the deletion spans 890 Kb , between genomic positions g . 98731380 and g . 99618794 on chromosome X , and showed that it has occurred de novo since it was not found in the mother of the patient ( Figure 1B ) . Identification of Additional Patients with Point Mutations in the Coding Sequence of PCDH19 by Direct Sequencing PCDH19 encodes protocadherin 19 , a transmembrane protein of the cadherin family of calcium - dependent cell – cell adhesion molecules , which is strongly expressed in the central nervous system . In the postnatal brain , protocadherins might be involved in the modulation of synaptic transmission and the generation of specific synaptic connections [ 20 ] . PCDH19 was therefore an attractive candidate gene for epilepsies and mental retardation . To test whether a PCDH19 deficiency might be implicated in some epileptic encephalopathies resembling Dravet syndrome , we sequenced the coding region of this gene in 73 SCN1A - negative probands ( the remaining 40 patients of the initial series plus 33 additional patients , for a total of 45 females and 28 males ) . Ten different variants were identified in 11 unrelated female probands at the heterozygous state ( Figure 2A ) . All but one were located in exon 1 : three were nonsense mutations ( c . 142G . T / p . Glu48X , c . 352G . T / p . Glu118X , c . 859G . T / p . Glu287X ) , two were small deletions and insertions creating a frameshift ( c . 506delC / p . Thr169SerfsX43 and c . 1036 _ 1040dup / p . Asn347Lys fs X23 ) and the remaining five were missense mutations ( c . 361G . A / p . As - p121Asn , c . 595 G . C / p . Glu199Gln , c . 1019A . G / p . Asn340Ser , c . 1628 T . C / p . Leu543Pro and c . 3319 C . G / p . Arg1107Gly ) . Glu48X was present in two affected sisters of family 2 ; Glu118X was identified in an isolated patient ( family 3 ) and Glu287X was found independently in a patient with family history of epilepsy and mental retardation ( family 4 ) and in an isolated patient ( family 5 ) . Interestingly , the c . 3319 C . G / p . Arg1107Gly missense variant , located in exon 6 , was associated with the p . Glu287X mutation in the proband of family 5 . In family 6 , cytosine 506 ( c . 506delC ) was deleted in a patient whose parents were unaffected , but whose female cousin also had epilepsy and moderate mental retardation . The 5 - bp duplication ( c . 1036 _ 1040dup ) was present in the index case of family 7 . The p . Asp121Asn mutation was identified in the index case of family 8 , who had a sister with epilepsy and psychotic disturbances . Finally , p . Glu199Gln , p . Asn340Ser and p . Leu543Pro variants were identified in the 4 remaining isolated patients ( families 9 to 12 ) ; Asn340Ser was found in two independent patients ( families 10 and 11 ) . These 4 missense variants ( p . Asp121Asn , p . Glu199Gln , p . Asn340Ser and p . Leu543Pro ) all affected amino - acids in the extracellular domain of protocadherin 19 , which are highly conserved in orthologs and in paralogs of PCDH19 in the delta protocadherin family ( Figure 2B ) . Interestingly , p . Arg1107Gly , associated with the de novo Glu287X mutation in the proband of family 5 , affected a residue of the protein that is conserved in mammalian orthologs , but not in other species or in paralogs ( Figure 2B ) . To confirm that the variants are pathogenic , we screened 180 healthy Caucasians . Only Arg1107Gly was found in a healthy female individual and was thus considered to be a rare polymorphism . None of the other variants was Author Summary Severe epilepsies associated with cognitive impairment in children are multifarious and most affected patients are sporadic cases . Thus , there is a challenge to identify which of these epilepsies are genetically determined , since their sporadic status excludes the use of classical genetic approaches . We have used microarrays , which are new technological tools to investigate the whole genome of an individual , to search for small genomic abnormalities and identify novel genes in 41 patients with a clinically well - characterized severe infantile epileptic disorder called Dravet syndrome . We have identified PCDH19 , a new gene on chromosome X , which was recently found in a familial epileptic syndrome known as female - limited epilepsy and cognitive impairment . This gene was mutated in 12 out of 74 patients with clinical features compatible with Dravet syndrome . Eleven of these patients were females . The single male with a PCDH19 deficiency was mosaic in his skin ; i . e . , some of his cells express PCDH19 and others do not . This finding suggests that a new pathogenic mechanism—cellular interference—is associated with an unusual X - linked mode of inheritance in which females are more frequently affected than males . PCDH19 Mutations in Dravet - Like Syndrome PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 2 February 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 2 | e1000381 found in the control population , confirming that they are causal mutations . The parents and relatives of PCDH19 - positive patients were also analysed when possible ( Figure 3 ) . The p . Glu48X mutation , found in two affected sibs in family 2 , was inherited from their asymptomatic father . Likewise , the c . 1036 _ 1040dup5 , p . As - p121Asn and p . Leu543Pro mutations were inherited from the healthy fathers of the index cases in families 6 , 8 and 12 . In family 6 , the 5 - bp duplication was inherited from the paternal grandmother who also had epilepsy and cognitive impairment , and transmitted to the half - brother of the father and his affected daughter ( i . e . the index case’s cousin , Figure 3 ) . In family 4 , the mother of the proband had mental retardation associated with adult - onset epilepsy , a clinical feature also present in the maternal grandmother and maternal aunt ; the proband’s father also presented with moderate mental retardation but without epilepsy .

In contrast , in families 5 , 7 , 10 and 11 , the mutations ( p . Glu287X , c . 506delC and p . Asn340Ser , respectively ) occurred de novo in the index cases , since they were not found in either parent . Interestingly , Arg1107Gly was inherited from the asymptomatic father in family 5 . In family 4 , only the mother and sisters of the index case were available for genetic analyses . Both sisters , who were monozygous twins , had mild psychomotor and cognitive impairment but never had seizures . Neither the mother nor the sisters had the p . Glu287X mutation . Analysis of the haplotypes in Xq22 . 1 ( PCDH19 locus ) with microsatellite markers confirmed that the three sisters ( the two twins and the affected proband ) received the same X chromosome from their father , with and without the p . Glu287X mutation , which indicates that the mutation also occurred de novo in this family . Finally , in family 9 , the mother did not have the p . Glu199Gln mutation but the father remained unavailable for genetic analyses . FISH Shows Somatic Mosaı¨cism in the Male Patient with the PCDH19 Deletion Recently , PCDH19 mutations were shown to cause epilepsy and mental retardation limited to females ( EFMR ) , a familial disorder associating childhood - onset epilepsy and a variable degree of cognitive impairment with an unusual mode of inheritance : this X - linked disorder is found in females with heterozygous mutations but not in males with hemizygous mutations [ 6 ] . How , then , can we explain the affected male in our series with a deletion of the entire PCDH19 ? Random X - inactivation in mutated females normally leads to tissue mosaicism in which two cell populations , one expressing normal PCDH19 and the other expressing the mutated allele , co - exist . To explain why only females are affected , it might be hypothesized that the co - existence of PCDH19 - positive and PCDH19 - negative cells would be pathogenic whereas homogeneous cell populations ( PCDH19 - positive in normal individuals but PCDH19 - negative in mutated males ) would not [ 6 ] . A mechanism of this type was previously termed ‘‘cellular interference’’ [ 21 ] . Two cell populations would also be found in mosaic males , who , according to this hypothesis , would be affected like mutated females . To test whether our male patient was mosaic for the PCDH19 gene deletion , we compared peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) and cultured fibroblasts from the patient by FISH with a probe specific to the PCDH19 genomic region . Although no signal corresponding to PCDH19 was detectable in PBL , a normal PCDH19 allele was found in 53 % of the fibroblasts ( Figure 4 ) , confirming that the patient was mosaic , in his skin , for the Figure 2 .

This result confirms that mutations in PCDH19 can be responsible , in mosaic males , for epileptic encephalopathy phenotypes that are usually limited to females , and strongly supports the hypothesis that cellular interference is the main pathogenic mechanism of the disease .

Nevertheless , contrary to SCN1A - positive patients ( SCN1A - DS ) , myoclonic jerks , atypical absences , and photosensitivity were unfrequent in PCDH19 - positive patients ( PCDH19 - DS ) ( 3 , 3 and 1 patients out of 13 , respectively ) . Only 6 patients presented status epilepticus . The mental delay was mild in 6 patients , moderate in 4 and only 3 patients presented with severe delay . Although much delayed , the language was present in all patients , with 12 out of 13 able to formulate short sentences . Discussion In this study , we used SNP microarrays to search for microrearrangements in patients with clinical features suggestive of Dravet syndrome but without mutations in SCN1A in order to identify new causative genes . The identification of a de novo hemizygous deletion of PCDH19 , encoding protocadherin 19 , in a male patient led us to screen the coding region of this gene in the remaining patients . Eleven unrelated probands with point mutations in PCDH19 , all females , were found . While this study was ongoing , PCDH19 was reported to be the causative gene for female - limited epilepsy and cognitive impairment ( EFMR ) , a disorder characterized by seizure onset in infancy or early childhood and cognitive impairment , which is found only in females in multi - generational families [ 6 ] . Since all of our patients with point mutations in PCDH19 were females as previously reported , we investigated the possibility that the male patient in whom the gene was deleted might be mosaic for the deletion . FISH analysis confirmed this latter hypothesis . The thirteen patients with PCDH19 mutation or deletion ( 12 probands and one sib , family 2 ) all fulfilled the main criteria for DS and were all negative for mutation or rearrangement in SCN1A after direct sequencing and multiplex ligation - dependent probe amplifi - cation ( MLPA ) [ 15 ] . The proportion of PCDH19 - DS probands in our series of SCN1A - negative patients was 16 % ( 12 / 74 ) , or even 25 % ( 11 / 45 ) if only female patients were included in the calculation . Considering that approximately 25 % of all patients with DS are SCN1A - negative [ 15 ] , PCDH19 might overall account for 5 % of DS patients . PCDH19 - DS patients and SCN1A - DS patients have many features in common including : normal psychomotor development before seizures onset , early onset of seizures ( before age one year ) , association of febrile and afebrile seizures , with a high susceptibility of the seizures to fever for all 13 patients , occurrence of hemiclonic or unilateral seizures ( 11 / 13 ) , and association of generalized tonic - clonic and focal seizures ( 12 / 13 ) , a high proportion of seizures occurring in clusters ( 12 / 13 ) , prolonged seizures , a proportion of which lead to status epilepticus , secondary progressive appearance of mental and motor regression and language delay , accompanied , in some cases , with ataxia ( Table 1 ) . However , PCDH19 - DS patients slightly differ on average from the classical pattern reported in SCN1A - DS . PCDH19 - DS Figure 4 .

Less than half ( 6 / 13 ) of the PCDH19 - DS patients had status epilepticus although this is a highly frequent feature in SCN1A - DS ( 93 / 113 , p , 0 . 007 ) . Photosensitivity , frequently reported in SCN1A - DS , was exceptional in PCDH19 - DS and was reported in only one patient but the difference with SCN1A - DS in our series of patients was however not significant . Seizures were , on average , less intractable than in SCN1A - DS , and patients above six years of age ( 9 / 12 patients ) had less than 4 seizures a year with one patient who was free of seizures at the time of the study . Although all patients were on tri - or poly - therapy , seizures were relatively well - controlled , a situation rarely achieved in SCN1A - DS . Intellectual and language delay were constant but were less severe than the classical outcome of SCN1A - DS [ 8 ] ( mostly with important speech and mental delay ) although the difference was not significant . Finally , myoclonic jerks and atypical absences were present in only 2 and 3 patients , respectively , whereas they are frequent features in SCN1A - DS ( myoclonic jerks : 55 / 110 , p , 0 . 018 ; atypical absences : 92 / 108 , p , 0 . 0001 ) . Patients with SMEI but without myoclonia have been previously referred as SMEB ( borderline severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy ) [ 22 ] , but SMEI and SMEB are currently grouped together under the term DS . In addition , the same types of mutation , and even the same mutations , are found in patients with DS and patients with other infantile epileptic encephalopathies ( such as cryptogenic generalized or focal epilepsies ) , which has extended the clinical spectrum of SCN1A and the definition of DS [ 15 ] . Therefore , in individuals , these divergent clinical character - istics are not sufficient to distinguish between patients with SCN1A or PCDH19 mutations , and the two clinical spectrums largely overlap . They can be useful , however , to prioritize molecular diagnosis although they must be first confirmed on larger series . Mutations in PCDH19 were recently reported to cause EFMR , which also associates mental retardation and epilepsy exclusively in females . EFMR was differentiated from DS by the authors on both clinical and genetic grounds [ 6 , 23 ] . The clinical features of EFMR , unlike those of DS , are highly variable , even in members of the same family : onset of seizures is between 6 and 36 months , the patients present with a combination of febrile and afebrile seizures of various types and a variable degree of psychomotor delay and cognitive impairment , ranging from mild to severe mental retardation [ 23 ] . Dibbens et al . reported PCDH19 mutations in six large families and one small family with two affected sib pairs [ 6 ] . All the patients were familial cases that were , for the most part , already adults at the time of examination , and appeared socially integrated in that most of them were married and had children . In the present study , on the contrary , the patients were essentially young , had a severe epileptic encepha - lopathy , and 8 of the 12 were isolated cases . In 6 patients out of 11 in whom inheritance could be assessed , the mutation occurred de novo . In the 5 remaining patients , the mutation was inherited from fathers who were healthy , had no cognitive impairment , and never had febrile seizures or epilepsy ( families 2 , 6 , 8 and 12 ) , or had mild mental retardation but no epilepsy ( family 4 ) . The global clinical pictures of PCDH19 - DS and EFMR appear therefore to differ . The difference in the phenotypes might be due to the modes of recruitment ( familial versus sporadic cases ) . It might also be hypothesized , that patients with PCDH19 - DS have a better final outcome than in those with SCN1A - DS despite the severity of their disease in childhood and that the two disorders are different clinical expressions of the same disease . Both hypotheses are not mutually exclusive . Interestingly , the variability in the severity of epilepsy and cognitive impairment in EFMR is reminiscent of what is observed in GEFS + families ( generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus , # MIM # 604233 ) , an autosomal dominant condition that also associates febrile seizures with epilepsy of variable types and severity , and which is associated in , 10 – 15 % of the families with missense mutations in SCN1A [ 10 ] . Although patients with GEFS + are usually responsive to treatment and generally have a benign outcome , some family members may be more severely affected , and even present with DS . The clinical spectrum of PCDH19 mutations could be as broad as the spectrum of GEFS + . Random X inactivation could contribute to this variability by generating variable proportions of mutated to normal cells in the brains of the mutated females . Although the mutations in EFMR families and in PCDH19 - DS patients are distinct , the spectra of mutations are comparable , and include nonsense mutations , small deletions / insertions introducing a frameshift as well as missense mutations affecting highly - conserved amino - acids in the protein ( Figure 5 ) , which would probably cause loss - of - function of the mutated allele . Messenger RNAs with mutations introducing premature termination codons ( PTC ) have indeed been shown to be degraded via the nonsense - mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) surveillance system of the cell in fibroblasts from EFMR patients [ 6 ] . The identification of a whole gene deletion in the mosaic male patient with PCDH19 - DS also supports the loss - of - function as the main consequence of the mutations . However , all the point mutations identified so far are clustered in the large exon 1 of the gene corresponding to the extra - cellular cadherin domain of the protocadherin 19 protein , as previously reported by Dibbens and collaborators [ 6 ] . Further studies are needed to determine whether PTC mutations can be found in other exons ; this would be expected if the loss - of - function assumption is correct . EFMR and PCDH19 - DS are paradoxical X - linked disorders in which mutated females are severely affected whereas males carrying the mutation are phenotypically unaffected : they have normal cognitive function and no seizures although a subtle psychiatric carrier status was evoked [ 6 , 23 ] . All affected patients with point mutations identified in this study were also females . In families 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 and 12 , the mutation was inherited from the father . Five males ( families 2 , 6 and 8 ) were asymptomatic carriers of PCDH19 mutations , they were healthy , had no cognitive impairment or epilepsy , and none had histories of febrile seizures . In family 4 , however , the father who transmitted the mutation to his daughter had moderate mental retardation but no epilepsy . The link between the mutation and his cognitive impairment remains , however , uncertain . The only definitely affected male was , therefore , the patient who was mosaic for the PCDH19 deletion . There was no molecular evidence of mosaicism in the blood of the father in family 4 . Several mechanisms have been suggested to account for the unusual mode of inheritance observed in EFMR . 1 ) A dominant negative effect of the mutant protein in females ( as for mutations in STK9 / CDKL5 and MECP2 ) is unlikely , since it is usually associated with lethality in males . 2 ) Compensatory factors may exist in males ; in particular , a protocadherin gene on the Y chromosome ( PCDH11Y ) is specifically expressed in males and could play a role in a sex - dependent compensation ; a paralogous gene is located on the X chromosome ( PCDH11X ) , but the proteins encoded by the two genes are not identical [ 6 ] . In addition , the protocadherin family contains more than 80 genes scattered throughout the human genome [ 24 ] , supporting the hypothesis of molecular compensation . 3 ) Another explanation for the unusual mode of inheritance associated with PCDH19 mutations is cellular interference , a mechanism reminiscent of metabolic interference PCDH19 Mutations in Dravet - Like Syndrome PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 8 February 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 2 | e1000381 [ 6 , 21 , 25 ] . It postulates that random inactivation of one X chromosome in mutated females generates tissue mosaicism ( i . e . co - existence of PCDH19 - positive or PCDH19 - negative cells ) , which would be pathogenic by altering cell - cell interactions ; normal individuals and mutated males , who are homogeneous for PCDH19 - positive or PCDH19 - negative cells respectively , would not develop the disease ( Figure 6 ) . The identification of an affected male who was mosaic for the PCDH19 deletion in his fibroblasts , and therefore had PCDH19 - positive and PCDH19 - negative cells in this tissue , strongly supports the hypothesis of cellular interference as the main pathogenic mechanism associated with PCDH19 mutations . The co - existence of normal and mutated cells and the proportion of each population in the brain of this patient cannot , however , be extrapolated from fibroblasts or lymphocytes . To definitely establish that cellular interference is the pathogenic mechanism , it is necessary i ) to demonstrate that neuronal cells are mosaic , but also that ii ) females who are homozygous for PCDH19 mutations or deletions are also unaffected , like hemizygous males . Although pathogenesis in cells that express the mutated allele after inactivation corresponds to a loss - of - function , cellular interference would result in a gain - of - function at the tissue level , because of abnormal interactions between mutated and normal cells . This hypothesis supposes that the loss of protocadherin 19 is compensated for , but by a mechanism that is relatively independent of gender . The same X - linked pattern of inheritance and has been observed for craniofrontonasal syndrome ( CFNS ) , a disorder in which females have multiple skeletal malformations . The gene responsible for CFNS is EFNB1 , located in Xq12 and encoding Ephrin B1 , a transmembrane protein that is a ligand for Eph receptors [ 21 ] . The Ephrin B1 / Eph interaction plays a role in cell migration and pattern formation during developmental morpho - genesis [ 26 ] . Cellular interference , also proposed as the pathogenic mechanism for CFNS [ 21 ] , had previously been demonstrated in female mice heterozygous for Ephrin B [ 27 ] . Although homozy - gous female and hemizygous male mice showed comparable perinatal lethality due to major skeletal abnormalities , heterozy - gous females were even more affected , and they alone had polydactyly . Ephrin B1 - EphB receptor signaling was shown to regulate skeletal development by controlling cell movement . Mosaic expression of Ephrin B1 , caused by random X inactivation in heterozygous females , results in ectopic interactions between the Ephrin B1 ligand and EphB receptors , sufficient to induce the skeletal defects [ 27 ] . Protocadherin 19 is an 1148 amino - acids transmembrane protein belonging to the protocadherin delta2 subclass of the cadherin superfamily , which is highly expressed in neural tissues and at different developmental stages [ 6 , 28 , 29 ] . The precise functions of the protein remain so far unknown . However , Delta protocadherins were reported to mediate cell - cell adhesion in vitro and cell sorting in vivo , and could regulate the establishment of neuronal connections during brain development [ 24 , 30 ] . Ephrin B1 and protocadherin 19 could therefore share major character - istics . Several isoforms of protocadherin 19 have been reported to result from alternative splicing of exon 2 and the existence of two acceptor sites for intron 4 which adds a residue at the beginning of exon 5 . The isoform ( s ) implicated in the physiopathology of EFMR and PCDH19 - DS are still not known . Functional studies as well as the development of mouse models are now needed to confirm and unravel the molecular mechanisms of cellular interference in these diseases . In conclusion , these results extend the clinical spectrum associated with PCDH19 mutations : we demonstrated that mutations in this gene are not limited to familial female patients , but can also account for isolated cases . Our results suggest that isolated mosaic male patients are also susceptible to the disease . Finally , mutations in PCDH19 can cause an early and severe epileptic encephalopathy mimicking DS , a major problem for differential diagnosis . The high frequency of patients with PCDH19 found in this study justifies the molecular testing of this Figure 5 . Schematic representation of the point mutations identified in the PCDH19 gene .

This study also validates the use of SNP microarrays to identify novel genes in isolated patients with severe genetic pathologies . This strategy will hopefully identify new genomic regions or genes that would account for the , 15 – 20 % of DS patients that do not have SCN1A and PCDH19 mutations . Materials and Methods Patients A total of in 74 probands ( 45 females and 29 males ) , referred by specialized neuropediatric centres as having Dravet syndrome but who were negative for point mutations or rearrangements in SCN1A , were included in the study [ 15 ] . Forty - one of these patients were initially selected for the microarray analysis and 33 were later on included for sequencing of PCDH19 . The referring physicians filled out detailed clinical questionnaires for every patient . Clinical histories were also obtained when possible to assess the evolution of the disease . All clinical reports and questionnaires were re - examined by the same neuropediatrician ( RN ) . Intellectual assessment was based on psychological evaluation when available . Psychomotor skills and cognitive delay were clinically evaluated in all patients . The clinical diagnosis of DS included : normal cognitive and motor development prior to seizures onset , onset of the seizures before the age of one year , seizures mainly triggered by fever , long - lasting seizures ( . 15 min , that might evolve to status epilepticus ) , later occurrence of other types of seizures ( febrile and afebrile ) and cognitive regression . The presence of myoclonic jerks and / or ataxia was considered to be a highly characteristic , although inconstant , feature of the disease that could reinforce a diagnosis ; however , their absence did not exclude the clinical diagnosis of Dravet syndrome , since they were not previously observed in all patients with DS [ 7 , 31 ] . Informed written consent was obtained from the patients’ parents before blood sampling . This study was approved by the ethical committee ( CCPPRB of Pitie´ - Salpeˆtrie ` re Hospital , Paris , n u 69 - 03 , 25 / 9 / 2003 ) . Screening for Genomic Rearrangements with High - Density SNP Arrays Patients were screened using Illumina 370CNV - Duo genotyp - ing BeadChip arrays ( 370 K ) . The Infinium II Genotyping reaction steps were performed according to the manufacturer’s specifications ( Illumina , San Diego , CA ) on the P3S platform ( Pitie´ - Salpeˆtrie ` re Hospital ) . Briefly , 750 ng of genomic DNA were isothermally amplified at 37 u C overnight . The amplified products were fragmented by a controlled enzymatic process then precipitated with isopropanol . The dried precipitated pellet was resuspended , hybridized to 370CNV - Duo beadchips in a capillary flow - through chamber and incubated overnight at 48 u C . The amplified , fragmented DNA samples anneal to locus - specific 50 - mers during the hybridization step . Each bead type corresponds to one allele per SNP locus . After hybridization , allelic specificity was conferred by enzymatic single - base extension and fluorescent staining . Arrays were washed and dried for 1 h before imaging using a BeadArray Reader ( Illumina ) . Image data analysis and automated genotype calling was performed using Beadstudio 3 . 1 ( Illumina ) . All genomic positions were based on the UCSC and Ensembl Genome Browsers . Each copy number variant ( CNV ) identified in patients was searched in the database of genomic variants ( http : / / projects . tcag . ca / variation / ) , which repertories the structural variation in the Human genome , to determine whether this CNV is normally present in a control population . Analysis of the Xq22 . 1 Deletion with Nimblegen CGH Arrays Genomic DNA from the patients was analysed by microarray - based comparative genomic hybridization with the HG18 WG Figure 6 . Schematic illustration of the cellular interference mechanism associated with PCDH19 mutations . A ) In normal individuals , characterized by a homogeneous population of PCDH19 - positive cells , neurons are able to form normal neuronal networks ; B ) In mutated male patients , hemizygosity leads to a homogeneous population of PCDH19 - negative cells ; in this condition , neurons preserve the ability to form normal neuronal networks ; C ) In heterozygous mutated females , random X inactivation leads to the co - existence of two PCDH19 - positive and PCDH19 - negative cell populations . These two cell populations cause divergent cell sorting and migration ( due to attractive or repulsive interactions ) and lead to abnormal neuronal networks . Somatic mosaicism in mutated males gives rise to the same pathological situation . The precise mechanisms by which the neuronal networks are altered are still unknown . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1000381 . g006 PCDH19 Mutations in Dravet - Like Syndrome PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 10 February 2009 | Volume 5 | Issue 2 | e1000381 Tiling 385 K CGH array v2 . 0 ( Roche NimbleGen , Madison , WI ) , according to the NimbleGen hybridization Kit Protocol . Briefly , DNA samples from patients and controls were labelled by random priming : the DNA ( 1 m g ) was denatured in the presence of 5 9 Cy3 - or Cy5 - labeled random nanomers ( Trilink Biotehcnologies , San Diego , CA ) and incubated with 100 units of exo - klenow fragment ( NEB , Beverly , MA ) and dNTP mix [ 6 mM each in TE buffer ( 10 mMTris / 1 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 4 , Invitrogen ) ] for 2 h at 37 u C . Reactions were terminated by addition of 0 . 5 mM EDTA ( pH 8 . 0 ) , precipitated with isopropanol and resuspended in water . The Cy - labelled test sample ( Cy3 ) and the reference sample ( Cy5 ) were combined in 13 m L of Nimblegen Hybridization solution ( Roche Nimblegen ) . After denaturation , hybridization was carried out on a MAUI Hybridization System ( BioMicro Systems , Salt Lake City , NE ) for 18 h at 42 u C . The array was washed with the NimbleGen Wash System ( Roche NimbleGen ) , dried by centri - fugation and scanned with the genePix 4000B scanner ( Axon Instrument , Union City , CA ) . Fluorescence intensity ( raw data ) was obtained from the scanned images of the oligonucleotide tiling arrays with NIMBLESCAN 2 . 0 extraction software ( Nimblegen Systems ) . For each spot on the array , log2 ratios of the Cy3 - labeled test sample versus Cy5 reference sample were calculated . Regions were considered to be duplicated or deleted when result exceeded the + / 2 0 . 25 . Sequencing of the PCDH19 Coding Sequence Eleven specific primer pairs were designed to amplify the 6 exons and adjacent intron - exon boundaries ( , 100 bp from each side of the exons ) of the PCDH19 gene ( transcript reference EF676096 ) . Primer sequences are available on request . Forward and reverse sequence reactions were performed with the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit ( PE Applied Biosystems ) using the same primers . G50 - purified sequence products were run on an ABI 3730 automated sequencer ( PE Applied Biosystems ) and data were analyzed with the Seqscape 2 . 5 software ( Applied Biosystems ) . Mutations identified in the patients were looked for directly in the DNA of available parents by sequencing the corresponding amplicon . If neither parent had the mutation , the parents were tested with microsatellite markers at the Xq22 . 1 locus to ensure that the mutation occurred de novo . In addition , 180 European controls ( 90 males and 90 females ) were included to test new variants in the PCDH19 gene . Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ( FISH ) FISH experiments were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes ( blood samples ) and fibroblasts ( skin biopsies ) . Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 4 . 5 mg / ml glucose and 110 m g / ml pyruvate ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , 0 . 03 % glutamine , 1000 U / ml penicillin / streptomycin in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere for 2 weeks before FISH . Lymphocytes were grown in PB - Max medium ( Invitrogen ) for 3 days . Metaphase chromosome spreads were obtained by standard hypotonic treatment and methanol / acetate ( 3 / 1 ) fixation . The slides were washed with the cytology FISH accessory kit ( Dako ) . A FISH DNA probe , specific for the Xq22 . 1 region covering PCDH19 , was labeled with rhodamine by nick - translation after amplification of the RP11 - 99E24 BAC ( Invitrogen ) and cohybridized with a commercial subtelomeric control probe ( Cytocell ) , specific for the pseudo - autosomal region 1 ( chromosomes X / Y ) labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) . The slides were then washed and counterstained with 4 , 6 - diamino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) for chromosome identification . Metaphase cells were examined under a motorized reflected BX61 Olympus fluorescence microscope with filters for separate detection of DAPI , FITC and rhodamine . One hundred metaphase cells were counted to determine the degree of mosaicism in fibroblasts and lymphocytes . Metaphase chromo - somes from a karyotypically normal female were used as a control . Statistical Tests Frequencies were compared with the Chi - Square test or the Fisher exact test when appropriate . Means were compared using Mann - Whitney Rank Sum Test . Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat 3 . 5 software . Acknowledgements We thank the families for participating to this study .
