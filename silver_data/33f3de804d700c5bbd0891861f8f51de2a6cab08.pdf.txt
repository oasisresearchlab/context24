Crispino 1 1 Division of Hematology / Oncology , Northwestern University , Chicago , IL ; and 2 Department of Medicine , University of Chicago , Chicago , IL Enucleation of mammalian erythroblasts is a process whose mechanism is largely undeﬁned . The prevailing model sug - gests that nuclear extrusion occurs via asymmetric cytokinesis . To test this hy - pothesis , we treated primary erythro - blasts with inhibitors of cytokinesis , in - cluding blebbistatin , hesperadin , and nocodazole , and then assayed for enucle - ation . Although these agents inhibited cell - cycle progression and subsequent enucleation when added early in culture , they failed to block enucleation proper when added to postmitotic cells . These results suggest that contraction of the actomyosin ring is not essential for nuclear expulsion . Next , by ultrastruc - tural examination of primary erythro - blasts , we observed an accumulation of vacuoles in the cytoplasm proximal to the extruding nucleus . This ﬁnding led us to hypothesize that vesicle trafﬁcking con - tributes to erythroblast enucleation . Here , we show that chemical inhibitors of vesicle trafﬁcking block enucleation of primary erythroblasts without affecting differentiation , cell division , or apoptosis . Moreover , knock - down of clathrin inhib - ited the enucleation of late erythroblasts . In contrast , vacuolin - 1 , a small molecule that induces vacuole formation , increased the percentage of enucleated cells . To - gether , these results illustrate that vesicle trafﬁcking , speciﬁcally the formation , movement , and subsequent coalescence of vacuoles at the junction of the nucleus and the cytoplasm , is a critical compo - nent of mammalian erythroblast enucle - ation . ( Blood . 2010 ; 116 ( 17 ) : 3331 - 3340 ) Introduction Enucleation is the ﬁnal step in erythropoiesis before mammalian red blood cells enter the peripheral blood . Although many studies have shown that actin is required for this process , 1 , 2 the precise mechanism that governs this form of cellular maturation remains unknown . One of the prevailing models posits that enucleation of erythroid cells , lens epithelia , and keratinocytes is driven by apoptosis . 3 However , several lines of evidence suggest that apopto - sis is not involved in the ﬁnal steps of red blood cell maturation . First , inhibitors of caspases fail to block enucleation of primary erythroblasts , and expelled nuclei do not show DNA degradation . 2 Second , enucleation is not accompanied by cleavage of major nuclear substructural proteins , such as nuclear lamins , NuMA , or splicing factors Sm and SC35 . 4 Rather , it appears that caspase activation functions in an earlier step of erythropoiesis , likely during the transition from pronormoblasts to basophilic normoblasts . 5 , 6 Another model proposes that enucleation is a form of asymmet - ric cytokinesis . This hypothesis was ﬁrst discussed in the 1960s and is based upon morphologic criteria developed from electron microscopic observations . 7 , 8 Recent data support this model . For example , the ﬁnding that the expelled nuclei have a thin rim of cytoplasm covered by intact plasma membrane 2 , 9 is consistent with a cell - division event , as opposed to simple exocytosis of the nucleus . Moreover , the identiﬁcation of concentrated actin at the point of separation between the nucleus and nascent reticulocyte is similar to the contractile actomyosin ring that is characteristic of cytokinesis . 1 , 10 Although the presence of the actin cytoskeleton is required for enucleation , 1 , 2 , 11 its precise contribution to enucleation is unknown . Here , we investigated the role of cytokinesis in enucleation and discovered that cytokinesis is not required for enucleation proper . Rather , erythroblast enucleation requires the formation , movement , and fusion of cytoplasmic endocytic vesicles .

Enucleation assays were then performed as previously described . 11 For assays involving small molecule inhibitors of cytokinesis or vesicle trafﬁcking , drugs were added at either 24 or 38 hours of culture . Cells were collected after 48 hours of total incubation and stained , and the percentages of reticulocytes were quantiﬁed at 48 hours by gating on the Syto 64 low – and Ter119 - phycoerythrin – positive populations . The Student t test ( paired , 2 - tail distribution ) was used to evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of the differences in enucleation . Cell - cycle progression and cell death were measured by ﬂow cytometry of propidium iodide or annexin V – phycoerythrin and SytoX red staining , respectively . Note that dead cells were represented by both the SytoX red – and annexin V – positive gates . Since dynasore is inhibited by the presence of serum proteins , 12 erythroblasts were washed in serum - free media several times before being plated in a serum - free media supplement ( (cid:1) - minimal essential medium for spleen or Iscove modiﬁed Dulbecco medium for fetal liver assay , and 1 % Nutridoma - SP [ Roche Applied Science ] and 2mM L - glutamine ) with or without dynasore . Enucleation percentages were measured as described above . Transferrin uptake and live cell imaging in primary fetal liver erythroblasts Fetal liver erythroblasts were cultured as described above ( enucleation assays of primary murine erythroblasts ) for 40 hours , washed , and then incubated for 20 minutes in serum - free media to enhance the uptake of ﬂuorescently labeled transferrin . Next , MiTMAB , monensin , or solvent alone ( 100 % ethanol ) were added to the media at the indicated concentra - tions and incubated for 2 hours . Finally , transferrin AF - 594 ( 5 (cid:2) g / mL ) was added , and live cell images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse C1Si laser scanning confocal microscope after 15 minutes . Enucleation assays of primary human erythroblasts Human primary CD34 (cid:3) early hematopoietic cells were cultured in vitro in order to promote lineage commitment and differentiation into the erythroid lineage as previously described . 13 To knockdown the expression of clathrin , cells were transfected with 100nM small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) ON - TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNAs against clathrin light chain ( L - 004002 - 00 ; note that knocking down clathrin light chain results in a corresponding decrease in clathrin heavy chain 14 ) , or a nontargeting control siRNA ( D - 001810 - 10 ) on days 10 and 11 of culture with TransIT - TKO reagent ( Mirus Bio ) . Lysates were prepared from cells on day 13 to evaluate the extent of protein knockdown . On day 14 , 0 . 2 million cells were cytospun onto poly - L - lysine – coated slides ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and stained with benzidine and hematoxylin to visualize hemoglobin and nuclei , respectively . For enucleation assays with vesicle - trafﬁcking inhibitors , day 13 cells were treated with drugs for 30 hours and placed on slides in the same way . Slides were viewed under a light microscope and scored in a blinded fashion for the total number of benzidine - positive cells and the number of enucleated erythrocytes . Between 100 and 200 cells were counted per ﬁeld , and 4 adjacent ﬁelds of similar location in all slides were subjected to counting . Statistical signiﬁcance was determined by the paired , 2 - tailed Student t test . Hemoglobin estimation The hemoglobin contents of primary mouse fetal liver erythroblasts cultured in the absence or presence of vesicle - trafﬁcking inhibitors were quantiﬁed as previously described , 15 with minor modiﬁcations . After 38 hours of culture , erythroblasts were incubated with vesicle - trafﬁcking inhibitors , washed twice with 1 (cid:4) phosphate - buffered saline , and then resuspended in 0 . 5 mL of distilled water . The cells were then subjected to a cycle of freeze - thaw , centrifuged at 20 000 g for 10 minutes , and 0 . 2 mL of the resultant cell lysates were transferred to 96 - well plates in duplicates . Freshly prepared benzidine solution ( 20 (cid:2) L ) and 30 % ( wt / wt ) hydrogen peroxide ( 8 (cid:2) L ) were added to each well , and after a 5 - minute incubation , plates were read using a BIO - TEK Synergy - HT ( Bio - Tek Instruments ) , measuring the absorbance at 595 nm . A standard curve was generated by plating titrations of a freshly prepared hemoglobin solution ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Electron microscopy Terminal erythroblasts derived from fetal liver progenitors after 48 hours of differentiation were subject to centrifugation and then ﬁxed in 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 2 % glutaraldehyde , and 2 % paraformaldehyde solution overnight at 4°C . The pellets were then washed 3 (cid:4) in 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) , ﬁxed in 2 % osmium in 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 1 hour , rinsed in distilled water , and prestained with uranyl acetate for 30 minutes . Cells were then washed with water and dehydrated by ethanol . After 3 changes of propylene oxide , cells were applied in a mixture of propylene oxide and Epon / Araldite ( 1 : 1 ratio ) for 1 hour , embedded in Epon / Araldite resin , and placed in a 60°C oven overnight to polymerize . Uranyl acetate and lead citrate were used to stain the ultrathin sections , and images were acquired with a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope . Images were captured with a Gatan Ultrascan 4000SP camera and analyzed with GatanDigitalMicrograph software Version 1 . 4 . 3 . MEL cell culture Mouse erythroleukemia ( MEL ) cells were cultured in RPMI medium with 2mM L - glutamine , 10 % fetal bovine serum , 100 U penicillin , and 100 (cid:2) g streptomycin . Staining of cells with Syto 16 and SytoX blue ( Molecular Probes ) or Syto 16 and annexin V – cy5 ( BioVision ) was performed as previously described . 2 Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RNAwas isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen ) . cDNAwas prepared using the SuperScript III ( Invitrogen ) cDNA preparation kit . Real - time polymerase chain reaction was performed by standard methods , and data were analyzed by the (cid:5)(cid:5) C ( T ) method . 18S RNA was used as the standard . Results Cytokinesis is not required for enucleation To determine at what stage the characteristic events of cytokinesis , including the contractile actomyosin ring , are required for enucle - ation , we performed short - term ( 5 - hour ) ex vivo enucleation assays of primary murine erythroblasts in the presence of various chemi - cal inhibitors of cytokinesis . 16 These drugs included blebbistatin , a nonmuscle myosin II ATPase inhibitor that prevents contraction of the actomyosin ring during cytokinesis , SU - 6656 , which disrupts cytokinesis by preventing the formation of the ﬁlipin ring , hespera - din , an aurora B kinase inhibitor , and nocodazole , a microtubule - stabilizing factor . For these assays , we collected spleens from wild - type phlebotomized mice , generated single - cell suspensions , and then separated cells on a Percoll gradient ( Figure 1A ) . The resulting mononuclear cells , 40 % - 50 % of which were CD71 (cid:3) / Ter119 (cid:3) erythroblasts , were incubated for 5 hours in the presence of drugs , stained with Syto16 and SytoX , and the degree of enucleation was evaluated by ﬂow cytometry . We discovered that blebbistatin , hesperadin , SU - 6656 , and nocodazole all failed to inhibit enucleation , whereas cytochalasin D , an inhibitor of actin polymerization that is known to inhibit enucleation , 1 potently blocked this process ( Figure 1B and supplemental Figure 1 , available on the Blood Web site ; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article ) . Although these cytokinesis inhibitors failed to block enucleation , similar doses of each 3332 KEERTHIVASAN et al BLOOD , 28 OCTOBER 2010 (cid:1) VOLUME 116 , NUMBER 17 only .

Based on the lack of an inhibitory effect on enucleation , we conclude that asymmetric cytokinesis is not the proximal mechanism of erythroblast enucleation . Because other groups have reported that inhibitors of cytokine - sis interfere with enucleation of erythroid cells , we next used an extended 48 - hour murine model of enucleation that included an early phase of proliferation , followed by cell - cycle exit and subsequent enucleation ( Figure 2A ) . Ter119 - negative fetal liver erythroblasts isolated from mouse embryos were cultured ex vivo for 48 hours as previously described 11 and treated with inhibitors of cytokinesis at either 24 or 38 hours ( Figure 2B ) . We discovered that the addition of blebbistatin or nocodazole potently blocked enucle - ation at the 24 - hour time point , but had no effect when added at 38 hours . Analysis of the cell cycle of these cultured cells revealed that both drugs caused cell - cycle arrest and polyploidization when added at 24 hours , but not at 38 hours . These ﬁndings demonstrate that inhibitors of cytokinesis inhibit enucleation indirectly by blocking cell - cycle progression of proliferating early erythroblasts . Coupled with our data from the short - term assays ( Figure 1B ) , these results lead us to conclude that cytokinesis is not the main driving force behind enucleation . Inhibitors of vesicle trafﬁcking block enucleation of murine erythroblasts Next , to gain insights into the mechanism of enucleation , we performed electron microscopy of mouse fetal liver erythroblasts and analyzed the ultrastructural features of enucleating cells . Intriguingly , we observed an accumulation of vesicles and vacuoles proximal to the extruding nuclei ( Figure 3A ) , consistent with previous reports . 17 , 18 These ﬁndings led us to hypothesize that vesicle trafﬁcking may be associated with , and / or required for , enucleation . To test this model , we evaluated the effect of a battery of small molecules , including MiTMAB , dynasore , monensin , A5 , sucrose , and brefeldin A ( BFA ) , each of which act on various aspects of the vesicle - trafﬁcking pathway , on enucleation . MiT - MAB 19 and dynasore 20 are dynamin inhibitors that prevent endocy - tosis . Monensin , a lipid - soluble Na (cid:3) ionophore , disrupts the Na (cid:3) and H (cid:3) gradients across the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) , endo - somes , and lysosomes , and causes an increase in intraluminal pH , thereby blocking their secretory function and impairing trafﬁc between endosomes and lysosomes . 21 Compound A5 is a piperazi - nyl phenylethanone derivative that speciﬁcally inhibits trafﬁcking between TGN and endosomes that depend on AP - 1 – mediated , clathrin - coated vesicle formation . 22 Sucrose effectively inhibits clathrin - coated pit formation and thus blocks endocytosis . 23 BFA is a fungal metabolite that interacts with the sec7 domain of the large guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) GBF1 ( Golgi - associated BFA - resistant ) , BIG1 ( BFA - inhibited1 ) , and BIG2 ( BFA - inhibited2 ) and inhibits their action on Arf1 - 3 ( class I ADP ribosylation factor ) GTPases . 24 Thus , BFA blocks the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) to Golgi transport and post - TGN trafﬁc to endo - somes that depend on AP - 1 - GGA ( Golgi - localized , (cid:6) - ear – containing , Arf - binding protein ) recruitment . 25 We assayed the effect of endocytic vesicle - trafﬁcking inhibitors on the enucleation of 2 sources of primary murine erythroblasts : adult spleen and fetal liver erythroblasts . With respect to fetal liver erythroblasts , MiTMAB and dynasore potently interfered with enucleation , but had little effect on cell - cycle progression , cell viability , or differentiation ( Figure 3 and supplemental Figure 3 ) . 500 µg / ml Transferrin Percoll gradient Spleen Phlebotomy of 10 weeks old mouse 4 Days Homogenized Percentage of enucleated cells measured by flow cytometry 5 Hours 500 µg / mL Percoll gradient Spleen Phlebotomy of 10 weeks old mouse 4 Days Homogenized Percentage of enucleated cells measured by flow cytometry 5 Hours Blebbistatin 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 CytoD 15 µM 30 µM 60 µM Blebbistatin 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 CytoD 15 µM 30 µM 60 µM SU - 6656 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 CytoD 2 µM 10 µM 20 µM SU - 6656 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 CytoD 2 µM 10 µM 20 µM Hesperadin 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 CytoD 100 nM 1 , 000 nM Hesperadin 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 CytoD 100 nM 1 , 000 nM Nocodazole 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 CytoD 1 µM 10 µM Nocodazole 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 CytoD 1 µM 10 µM % E nu c l ea t i on c o m p a r e d t o un t r ea t e d Drugs Drugs Drugs A B Figure1 .

Given that the block in enucleation was only observed with the higher dose , we conclude that the block in enucleation was not due to apoptosis .

VESICLE TRAFFICKING IN ERYTHROBLAST ENUCLEATION 3335 BLOOD , 28 OCTOBER 2010 (cid:1) VOLUME 116 , NUMBER 17 only . For personal use at J S GERICKE LIBRARY on November 20 , 2012 . bloodjournal . hematologylibrary . org From and the endosome / lysosomal secretory pathways are selectively required for erythroblast enucleation , and further suggest that trafﬁcking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the TGN and post - Golgi transport to endosomes are not essential for enucleation ( Figure 4B ) . A role for vesicle trafﬁcking in enucleation is further supported by our observation that BDM , a nonspeciﬁc inhibitor of myosin ATPase activity , 26 but not BTS , a speciﬁc inhibitor of muscle myosin II subfragment 1 actin - stimulatedATPase activity , 27 blocked enucleation ( supplemental Figure 4 ) . These data suggest that myosins V and VI , which participate in vesicle trafﬁcking 28 - 30 and are blocked by BDM but not by BTS , may be required for enucleation . Although we did not detect an effect of these drugs on differentiation , as assessed by Ter119 staining , we next investigated whether inhibition of vesicle trafﬁcking would block accumulation of hemoglobin . We performed enucleation assays of primary murine fetal liver erythroblasts in the presence of vesicle - trafﬁcking inhibitors and quantiﬁed both the extent of enucleation by ﬂow cytometry and the degree of hemoglobin accumulation by a biochemical assay . We found that MiTMAB and monensin reduced enucleation , but failed to signiﬁcantly affect hemoglobin accumula - tion ( supplemental Figure 3 ) . In particular , 10 (cid:2) M MiTMAB decreased enucleation by 90 % , but only reduced the hemoglobin level by 10 % . In contrast , dynasore caused a signiﬁcant reduction in both hemoglobin accumulation and enucleation when used at both 40 and 80 (cid:2) M . However , the control reaction for dynasore , which included the use of a serum supplement in place of serum , led to a 50 % decline in hemoglobin concentration , but no difference in enucleation , compared with the serum - containing control . This argues against a simple correlation between enucle - ation efﬁciency and hemoglobin accumulation in vitro . To determine how monensin treatment leads to a profound block in enucleation , we treated late stage primary mouse fetal liver erythroblasts with 1 (cid:2) M monensin for 10 hours and then observed the ultrastructure of the cells by electron microscopy . Whereas control solvent – treated cells harbored numerous cytoplasmic vacu - oles , monensin - treated cells displayed few , if any , vacuoles ( Figure 5A ) . Indeed , the presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles directly corre - lated with enucleation . To further conﬁrm that MiTMAB and monensin function by interfering with endocytic vesicle trafﬁck - ing , we monitored the uptake of labeled transferrin by mouse primary fetal liver erythroblasts in the absence or presence of these drugs . We found that both MiTMAB and monensin potently blocked the uptake of transferrin without inducing cell death ( Figure 5B ) . Enucleation of human erythroblasts is also disrupted by vesicle - trafﬁcking inhibitors To conﬁrm that the essential role for vesicle trafﬁcking extends beyond murine erythroblasts , we assayed the effect of MiTMAB and monensin on enucleation of primary human CD34 (cid:3) cells cultured under conditions to generate reticulocytes . 13 In this culture system , the majority of cells had reached the orthochromatic stage Endoplasmic reticulum Trans golgi network Early and sorting endosome Late endosome Endocytic vesicle Recycling or secretory vesicle Lysosome Endocytic pathway Recycling or secretory pathway Endoplasmic reticulum Trans golgi network Early and sorting endosome Late endosome Endocytic vesicle Recycling or secretory vesicle Lysosome Endocytic pathway Recycling or secretory pathway SucroseMiTMABDynasore A5 Brefeldin A Brefeldin A Monensin Monensin SucroseMiTMABDynasore A5 Brefeldin A Brefeldin A Monensin Monensin MonensinMonensin % E nu c l ea t i on c o m p a r e d t o un t r ea t e d Monensin 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control 200 nM 400 nM 600 nM 800 nM 1 , 000 nM * * * * * * * * Monensin 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control 200 nM 400 nM 600 nM 800 nM 1 , 000 nM * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Sucrose 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control 25 mM 50 mM 100 mM 150 mM * * * * * * * Sucrose 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control 25 mM 50 mM 100 mM 150 mM * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Brefeldin A 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control 0 . 5 µM 1 µM 5 µM 10 µM Brefeldin A 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control 0 . 5 µM 1 µM 5 µM 10 µM MiTMAB 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control 10 µM 30 µM * * * * * * MiTMAB 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control 10 µM 30 µM * * * * * * * * * * * * A5 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control 3 µM 10 µM 25 µM 50 µM * * * * A5 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control 3 µM 10 µM 25 µM 50 µM * * * * * * * * Dynasore 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control 40 µM 80 µM * * Dynasore 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Control 40 µM 80 µM * * A B Figure 4 .

MiTMAB and monensin were added to the cultures on day 13 , incubated for 30 hours , and the effects on enucleation were quantiﬁed . Consistent with our murine data , we found that MiTMAB and monensin signiﬁcantly blocked enucleation ( supplemental Figure 5 ) : in comparison to control cultures , which generated 37 . 5 % reticulo - cytes , 10 (cid:2) M MiTMAB and monensin ( 0 . 2 (cid:2) M ) led to 22 . 98 % ( P (cid:8) . 01 ) and 26 . 2 % ( P (cid:8) . 05 ) reticulocytes , respectively . Clathrin - dependent endocytic vesicle trafﬁcking plays an important role in enucleation Having discovered that vesicle trafﬁcking plays an important role in enucleation , we next asked whether the endocytosis during enucleation is clathrin - or caveolin - dependent . Primary human CD34 (cid:3) cells cultured under conditions to generate reticulocytes 13 were harvested , and RNA ( days 3 , 7 , 10 , and 14 ) and protein lysates ( days 3 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 13 , and 16 ) were prepared . We found that clathrin increased from days 3 to 10 and remained elevated through day 16 , whereas caveolin - 1 was undetectable throughout erythroid develop - ment ( supplemental Figure 6 ) . Next , to determine whether clathrin - mediated vesicle trafﬁck - ing is required for enucleation , we used siRNA methodology to knock down its expression in orthochromatic erythroblasts derived from primary human CD34 (cid:3) cells . To achieve selective knock - down in late orthochromatic cells , we introduced siRNAs against clathrin , or a control siRNA , into the cells by transfection on days 10 and 11 of culture and then assayed the extent of protein knock down on day 13 and the effect on enucleation on day 14 ( Figure 6 ) . We discovered that knock down of clathrin heavy chain signiﬁ - cantly reduced the extent of enucleation ( 25 . 5 % vs 35 . 3 % ; P (cid:9) . 022 ) . Of note , the knock down of clathrin did not affect differentiation or survival of these primary cells ( Figure 6C - D ) . These results demonstrate that clathrin contributes to erythroblast enucleation . Increasing vacuole formation promotes enucleation If enucleation is driven by accumulation of endocytic vesicles , then increased vacuole formation might enhance the process . To assay this , we treated primary murine fetal liver erythroblasts with vacuolin - 1 , which has been shown to promote the formation of enlarged vacuoles that are derived from the fusion of endosomes and lysosomes . 31 , 32 We discovered that vacuolin - 1 conferred a dose - dependent increase in the enucleation of primary erythro - blasts ( Figure 7A ) without affecting the cell cycle , cell death , or differentiation of erythroblasts ( Figure 7B ) . Discussion Enucleation is a late evolutionary event that provides mammalian reticulocytes with greater ﬂexibility and increased oxygen - carrying capacity . Forty - year - old electron micrographs revealed that there is a marked similarity between enucleation and cytokinesis . In particular , erythroblast enucleation was accompanied by the appear - ance of centrioles , polysome disaggregation , and cytoplasmic protrusions , into one of which the nucleus penetrates . 7 , 8 Recent studies have conﬁrmed that the process of nuclear expulsion is a cell - intrinsic phenomenon in which the extruded nucleus is encap - sulated by a thin rim of cytoplasm . 2 After separation of the nucleus from the nascent reticulocyte , macrophages within the blood islands engulf expelled nuclei , which express phosphatidylserine on their surface . With respect to the mechanism of enucleation , the focus , of late , has been on investigating the role of the erythroid cytoskeleton and actin polymerization in this process . Elegant work by 2 groups has shown that RacGTPases contribute to enucleation by affecting the erythroid cytoskeleton and the formation of the contractile actin ring . 11 , 33 Despite the requirement for the formation of the contractile actin ring , our study provides strong evidence that other cellular events provide the driving force for enucleation . First , we show that blebbistatin , a selective nonmuscle myosin ATPase inhibitor that inhibits actomyosin ring contractility in cytokinesis , 16 does not block enucleation . Rather , the effect of the drug is to block cell - cycle progression during the earlier stages of terminal differentiation . Second , a src kinase inhibitor , SU - 6656 , which is known to prevent the ﬁlipin ring formation in cytokine - sis , 16 also has no effect on enucleation . Third , we demonstrate that other inhibitors of cytokinesis , such as the aurora B kinase inhibitor , hesperadin , do not affect enucleation of primary erythro - blasts . Finally , neither nocodazole nor colchicine , which stabilize or eliminate microtubule polymerization , respectively , affected enucleation ( Figures 1B and 2B and supplemental Figure 7 ) , suggesting the lack of a requirement for functional microtubule in enucleation . 1 , 34 If endocytic vesicle trafﬁcking , not cytokinesis , is the mecha - nism for enucleation , what explains the requirement for actin ?

Scale bar , 1 (cid:2) m . ( B ) The effect of MiTMAB or monensin on vesicular trafﬁcking was evaluated by monitoring transferrinAF - 594 uptake in mouse primary fetal liver erythroblasts in the absence or presence of 10 (cid:2) M MiTMAB and 1 (cid:2) M monensin .

Images were processes using EZ - C1 Gold Version 3 . 8 . 0 and Image J Version 1 . 44a . Control cells displayed strong transferrin uptake , as evidenced by staining of cytoplasmic vesicles and vacuoles , with a striking alignment in the region between the nucleus and cytoplasm ( arrow ) . In contrast , MiTMAB and monensin potently blocked transferrin uptake and disrupted the distribution of transferrin receptors on the plasma membrane along the nuclear side ( arrowhead ) of the cells .

For personal use at J S GERICKE LIBRARY on November 20 , 2012 . bloodjournal . hematologylibrary . org From Several lines of evidence suggest that actin is involved in vesicle trafﬁcking . Actin is important for the formation of vesicles and for their initial movement away from the membrane . 35 , 36 Moreover , the actin cytoskeleton plays a critical role in the long range movements of vesicles that are mediated by myosins V and VI . 37 We propose that actin - dependent motor proteins , such as myosins V and VI , provide the force needed to move vesicles within the cytoplasm . Indeed , given that microtubules are not required for enucleation , 1 actin likely maintains the structure of the erythroblast and fuels the movement of intracellular organelles , including vesicles , endo - somes , lysosomes , and vacuoles . Our conclusion that enucleation is driven by the fusion of endocytic vesicles is supported by electron microscopic studies of enucleating canine erythroblasts , which highlighted an accumula - tion of vesicles within the cytoplasm of enucleating cells . 17 As enucleation proceeded , these vesicles coalesced to form dilated open spaces and irregular U - shaped channels in the vicinity of deep circumference of the nuclear envelope . These vesicles appeared to provide the plasma membranes needed to replace the area in which the nucleus had carried the original erythroblastic plasmalemma . Analysis of receptor - mediated endocytosis of transferrin in devel - oping fetal liver erythroblasts further support our model that vesicles accumulate at the junction between the nucleus and nascent reticulocyte . 18 These studies showed that there was a perinuclear accumulation of transferrin in orthochromatic erythroid cells , which was followed by the localization of transferrin in the cytoplasm adjacent to the extruding nucleus . 18 Although the above - mentioned electron micrographs and transferrin uptake experiments depicted prominent features of vesicle trafﬁcking in enucleating erythroblasts , no previous study has addressed the requirements for this process in enucleation . Our proposed new model for erythroblast enucleation is as follows ( Figure 7C and supplemental Video 1 ) . First , by an unknown mechanism , the nucleus of a maturing orthochromatic erythroblast is moved to one side of the cell . Next , as the cell initiates the enucleation program , cytoplasmic vesicles move toward the nucleus , where they accumulate and fuse with plasma membrane to form U - shaped channels or coalescence to form large vesicles . As these vesicles fuse with one another along the periphery of the nascent reticulocyte , the 2 entities ( ie , the nucleus and the reticulocyte ) are separated from one another . Although we exclude major events of cytokinesis in this process , it is noteworthy that endocytic vesicle trafﬁcking is postulated to provide membranes to complete cytoki - nesis in dividing cells . 38 , 39 Our model also reveals the source to satisfy the membrane requirements at the center during enucleation .
