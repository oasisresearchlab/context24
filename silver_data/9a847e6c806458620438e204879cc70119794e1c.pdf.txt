Mu‹ller 3 , 4 Atomic force microscopy and single - molecule force spectroscopy were com - bined to image and manipulate purple membrane patches from Halobacterium salinarum . Individual bacteriorhodopsin molecules were (cid:222)rst localized and then extracted from the membrane ; the remaining vacancies were imaged again . Anchoring forces between 100 and 200 piconewtons for the different helices were found . Upon extraction , the helices were found to unfold . The force spectra revealed the individuality of the unfolding pathways . Helices G and F as well as helices E and D always unfolded pairwise , whereas helices B and C occa - sionally unfolded one after the other . Experiments with cleaved loops revealed the origin of the individuality : stabilization of helix B by neighboring helices . Membrane proteins acquire their unique func - tions through specific folding of their polypep - tide chains stabilized by specific interactions in the membrane . Their stability or resistance to unfolding , which goes hand in hand with their anchoring into the hydrophobic belt of the membrane , is usually investigated by chemical or thermal denaturation ( 1 , 2 ) . Such experi - ments , however , provide only ensemble infor - mation about the energetics but not about indi - vidual proteins and their anchoring forces . As described by the fluid mosaic model ( 3 ) , mem - brane proteins may diffuse within the bilayer but in the normal direction are strongly restrict - ed to the membrane plane . It is expected that stability of membrane proteins involves inter - actions with the lipid bilayer as well as intra - and intermolecular interactions ( 1 ) . Thus , it is tempting to determine not only the forces that anchor membrane proteins in the membrane but also the forces that interact between their sec - ondary structure elements . To answer this pertinent question in mem - brane biology , we combined atomic force mi - croscopy ( AFM ) ( 4 – 6 ) and single - molecule force spectroscopy ( 7 – 17 ) to image individual membrane proteins ( 18 – 21 ) and to measure their molecular forces . We chose bacteriorho - dopsin ( BR ) , a light - driven proton pump , be - cause it represents one of the most extensively studied membrane proteins ( 22 , 23 ) . Structural analysis has revealed the photoactive retinal embedded in seven closely packed a - helices ( 24 – 28 ) , which builds a common structural motif among a large class of related G - protein – coupled receptors ( 29 – 32 ) . Moreover , BR has become a paradigm for a - helical membrane proteins in general and for ion transporters in particular ( 22 , 23 , 33 – 37 ) . Together with adja - cent lipids , BR molecules assemble into trim - ers , which are packed into two - dimensional hexagonal lattices , the so - called purple mem - brane of Halobacterium salinarum . We allowed native purple membrane to adsorb onto a freshly cleaved mica surface ( 38 ) . After being rinsed with buffer , the sub - molecular resolution of the cytoplasmic pur - ple membrane surface was routinely observed ( Fig . 1A ) ( 39 ) in the fluid cell of a commer - cial AFM . The hexagonal arrangement of the trimeric BR molecules was clearly resolved . Although similar structures can be obtained by electron microscopy and x - ray crystallog - raphy , AFM provides structural information about individual proteins and their subunits in aqueous solution ( Fig . 1A ) ( 40 ) . After imaging , we positioned the AFM sty - lus over a protein and pushed it onto the protein with a contact force of ; 1 nN for about 1 s . In about 15 % of all cases , this resulted in firm adsorption of the protein to the tip , and force extension spectra like the one shown in Fig . 1B were recorded when we retracted the tip ( in the other 85 % of cases , no attractive interaction was measured upon retraction ) . The surface was imaged again and , in all cases , we found a vacancy at this position ( Fig . 1C ) , confirming that extraction of a certain individual BR pro - tein had been recorded in the force spectrum . The fine structure in the force spectra thus contains information about the unfolding pro - cess , and the last peak indicates that the extrac - tion is completed . This experimental protocol ensures that we select and address individual molecules , and it demonstrates the high precision and sensitivity with which we manipulate the protein . Howev - er , we do not control which part of the protein interacts with the tip , nor do we have detailed information about the nature of this interaction . In fact , the length of the extracted protein stretch as well as the shape of the force spectra were found to vary significantly , reflecting the variability of the attachment sites . We therefore restricted our data analysis to the 33 % of all events in which firm binding of the protein to the tip occurred , which in addition to the im - aged vacancy showed a force spectrum with a final rupture peak at the length of an unfolded and fully extended BR . This additional criterion ensures that only those spectra are analyzed in which an individual protein was extracted that was attached to the tip at the cytoplasmic COOH - terminus ( see Fig . 2C ) . Note that 33 % is also about what one would expect for random selection of the anchoring point , taking into account that the COOH - terminus covers about one - quarter of the surface of the protein and consists of more than half of all amino acids accessible on the cytoplasmic side ( Fig . 4B ) . We emphasize that analysis of a selected subset of events from an ensemble is a strength and not a weakness of experiments with individual proteins . In many experi - ments we can analyze a certain well - defined subset that is characterized by clear criteria and we can investigate correlations within the data ( here the position of the last peak with details about the spectrum ) , which are not accessible in an ensemble average . A selection of typical unfolding spectra is shown in Fig . 2A . In all cases there are four well - pronounced peaks in predominantly de - scending order . The relative positions of the second and last peaks are well correlated , but the positions and shapes of the first and the third peaks varied considerably . Superposition of 11 spectra in Fig . 2B reveals that the position of the first peak varies statistically , whereas the third peak appears to be a double peak . The curves are the calculated force exten - sion relations based on the model shown in Fig . 2C . If we assume that , upon pulling at the cytoplasmic COOH - terminus , helices G and F are extracted and unfolded ( diffuse first peak ) , the protein stretch between the tip and the re - 1 CeNS and Lehrstuhl fu‹r angewandte Physik , Ludwig Maximilians - Universita‹t Mu‹nchen , Amalienstrasse 54 , 80799 Mu‹nchen , Germany . 2 Max - Planck - Institut fu‹r Biochemie , Am Klopferspitz 18a , 82152 Martinsried , Germany . 3 M .

The worm - like chain model previously has been shown to provide a very precise description for unfolded proteins . This model has no free parameter : for the Kuhn - length , the elasticity parameter , 0 . 8 nm was used , a value that was found to hold for a variety of proteins . The contour length was calculated from the known amino acid se - quence with a peptide length of 0 . 36 nm . The calculated curve describes perfectly the measured extensibility . The increasing force at the slope of the second peak thus reflects the stretching of the already unfolded 88 amino acids of the protein consisting of the intracellu - lar terminal , helices G and F , F – G loops , and E – F loops . Beyond forces of 100 to 200 pN , the remaining membrane anchor is destabilized and yields , which results in a drop in force on the right side of the second peak . Subsequent peaks can be described analogously . The curves were calculated based on the length increase by un - folding of helices E and D for the third peak and of helices C and B for the last peak . Descent of the last peak reflects extraction of helix A . Again , the agreement between theory and data is remarkable . In summary , upon pulling the COOH - terminus of BR , the protein is extracted two helices at a time . It is interesting to note here that pairwise coupling of the helices was proposed for the insertion process of BR into the membrane by thermodynamic means ( 41 ) . The unfolding peaks occur in predominantly descending order . In contrast to unfolding ex - periments on the muscle protein titin ( 8 ) where the maximum force of the peaks is in increasing order , because the weakest of the domains un - folds first , the order of the unfolding events here is determined by the position in the mem - brane . Missing neighbors destabilize the pack - ing and reduce the anchoring forces of the remaining helices . In control experiments ( 42 ) , we repeated the extraction experiments on dou - ble - layered membrane patches and found no difference . This confirms that the measured extraction forces reflect the membrane anchor - ing and that contributions of the detachment of the loops from the mica are negligible . Com - pared with lipids , which at similar loading rates were found to be extracted at forces as low as 25 pN ( 43 ) , here membrane anchoring of BR was found to be much stronger , presumably because of specific interactions of other than hydrophobic nature ( e . g . , by inter - and intrahe - lix hydrogen bonding and interaction with lip - ids ) . Because these extraction - unfolding exper - iments occur under nonequilibrium conditions , the measured forces are rate - dependent . As oth - ers have shown ( 8 , 9 , 43 – 45 ) , this rate depen - dence may reveal additional information about basic features of the binding potential . Here we have not analyzed this rate dependence and we have kept the pulling speed constant at 40 nm / s . In a second set of experiments we selective - Fig . 1 . Controlled extraction of an individual BR from native purple membrane . ( A ) Typical high - resolution AFM topograph of the cytoplasmic surface of a wild - type purple membrane . BR assembles in trimers ( for clarity , one is edged with a white line ) that arrange in a hexagonal lattice . Purple membranes of H . salinarum strain S1 were isolated as described ( 49 ) . A stock solution of protein ( 5 mg / ml ) was kept in ultrapure water at 4¡C . The AFM used was a Nanoscope III ( Digital Instruments , Santa Bar - bara , California ) equipped with a J - scanner ( 80 m m ) and oxide - sharpened Si 3 N 4 tips on a can - tilever ( Olympus , Tokyo ) . The spring constant of the cantilevers as estimated by analysis of the thermal noise spectra was 0 . 1 N / m . All experiments were done in buffer solution ( 300 mM KCl , 10 mM tris - HCl , pH 7 . 8 ) at room temperature . To catch an individual protein ( white circle ) , we zoomed in by reducing the frame size and the number of pixels . After the tip was positioned , it was kept in contact with the selected protein for about 1 s while a force of ; 1 nN was applied to give the protein the chance to adsorb on the stylus . ( B ) The stylus and protein surface were separated at a veloc - ity of 40 nm / s while the force spectrum was recorded ( 512 or 4096 pixels ) . The interaction between tip and surface , which is expressed in the marked discontinuous changes in the force , indicates a molecular bridge between tip and sample . This bridge reaches far out to distances up to 75 nm , which corresponds to the length of one totally unfolded protein . ( C ) After the adhesive force peaks were recorded , a topograph of the same surface was taken to show structural changes . Note that a single monomer is missing ( white circle ) . Thus , the recorded force spectrum may be correlated to extraction of an individual protein from the membrane . The defect at the lower rim was taken to correlate both topographs . The full gray - level range of the topographs is 1 . 5 nm . For this procedure , the drift of the microscope had to be minimized by thermal relaxation as indicated by the image shift , which was less than 5 nm / min . Fig . 2 . For analysis , only spectra with maximum length between 60 and 80 nm were selected . ( A ) Several force spectra taken on wild - type BR are shown . A typical repeating pattern is visible . All curves show four peaks located around 10 , 30 , 50 , and 70 nm . ( B ) Thirteen spectra are superposed on the second peak . This results in an exact cover of the third and fourth peaks , whereas the (cid:222)rst peak remains scattered . Gray lines are force extension curves calculated by the worm - like chain model with a Kuhnlength of 0 . 8 nm , which is known to describe the elasticity of an unfolded poly - amino acid chain . The lengths are based on the model shown in ( C ) . ( C ) This model explains the peaks in the force spectra as the sequential extraction and unfolding of a single BR . A rupture length of more than 60 nm can be recorded only if the COOH - terminus has adsorbed on the tip . If a force is applied on the COOH - terminus , helices F and G will be pulled out of the membrane and unfold . Upon further retraction , the unfolded chain will be stretched and a force will be applied on helices D and E until they are ex - tracted from the membrane . Thus , peak 2 re - (cid:223)ects unfolding of helices D and E and peak 3 re(cid:223)ects unfolding of helices B and C . Peak 4 shows extraction of the last remaining helix A . R E P O R T S 7 APRIL 2000 VOL 288 SCIENCE www . sciencemag . org 144 ly cleaved the E – F loop ( see Fig . 3C ) and repeated the measurements described above . For those experiments , we used a genetically engineered mutant in which specific cleavage sites for protease V8 were introduced in the E – F loop . Introducing the cleavage sites and cleaving the loop do not influence the function - ality and structure of the protein ( 46 ) . The first striking result was that we found no force spec - tra longer then 45 nm . We then analyzed all spectra that reached a length of 40 nm , which occurred in 25 % of all cases in which there was firm binding of the protein to the tip . This way we exclusively selected molecules that were attached to the tip with helix E . Representative force spectra are shown in Fig . 3A . Superposi - tion of 17 curves ( Fig . 3B ) clearly reveals that the unfolding pattern is shifted by one peak to shorter lengths . Calculated curves , based on the model shown in Fig . 3C , were superimposed again . The last peak at 40 nm again is per - fectly consistent with stretching of the fully unfolded helices B , C , D , and E and the corresponding loops . The descending side of the peak reflects unfolding and extraction of helix A , which results in final detachment . The peak at 18 nm reflects stretching of unfolded helices D and E together with the corresponding loops , and its descending side reflects unfolding and extraction of helices B and C . Helices D and E are extracted in the diffuse peak at the beginning . In fact the first peak , the unfolding of helices F and G , which now remain in the membrane , is the one that is missing . In addition to the unfolding pattern of the native protein , we found a well - pronounced structure in - between these two peaks on the membrane with the cleaved E – F loop . This means that details of the unfolding pathway of helices B and C are resolved and that this pathway differs from the pathway in the un - cleaved protein . The curve , which fits the elas - tic side of the intermediate peak , was calculated based on the assumption that helix B remains intact and that only helices C , D , and E and the connecting loops are stretched . While subse - quent extraction and unfolding of helix B , which is reflected in the sharp drop , appears to be an all - or - none process , extraction and un - folding of helix C follows a complex path . This is reflected in the finding that the force does not drop to the baseline but stays at about 100 pN , which means that this helix unfolds gradually . Thus , throughout successive unfolding of helix C , the interaction of the amino acids must re - main at a high level , which requires the struc - tures surrounding this helix to remain pre - served . The faint fine structure in this plateau , which contains further details about the unfold - ing process , is at the resolution limit of our instrument and is not discussed here . In sum - mary , after helices E and D are extracted as a pair , helix C unfolds step by step and then helix B proceeds in an all - or - none manner . The finding that helices C and B follow different unfolding patches in the different membranes is best understood in view of the three - dimensional structure sketched in Fig . 4 . In the native membrane , helices G and F are already unfolded when helices B and C are extracted . In the cleaved membrane , helices G and F are still in position , preserving the struc - ture and providing stabilizing interactions to helices B and C . Upon unfolding , these local interactions must be overcome and result in the fine structures in the measured force spectra . A close look at Fig . 2B reveals that , in rare cases , this intermittent unfolding pathway also is taken by the uncleaved protein in the mem - brane . One might speculate that helix A re - mains stabilized by helices F and G because the drop of the last peak occurs suddenly in the wild type , unlike the gradual descent in the cleaved membrane . For an additional control , we repeated the measurements with the mutant G241C , which has a cysteine instead of glycine in the COOH - terminus at position 241 ( 47 , 48 ) ; we contacted this with a gold - coated AFM tip to form a specific linkage . Unfortunately , because of the high adsorbance of proteins to gold surfaces , contamination prohibited high - resolution imag - ing and thus confirmation of individual manip - ulation by imaging the resulting vacancies . But we measured a site - specific single molecule attachment in more than 80 % of all contacts . The remaining 20 % are predominantly multiple interactions . The resulting force spectra fully corroborate our previous experiments and show even more details that support our previous interpretation ( Fig . 5 ) . Mechanical manipulation of selected mole - cules ( e . g . , by force spectroscopy in combina - tion with high - resolution imaging ) is an ex - tremely powerful approach , which in this study has revealed a very detailed map of the unfold - Fig . 3 . Force curves were recorded on BR where the E—F loop was cleaved enzymatically . ( A ) Selection of the longest force curves taken on the cleaved BR . No recorded spectrum showed a rupture length beyond 50 nm . Only three main peaks are visible(cid:209)around 5 , 25 , and 45 nm(cid:209)and the second is a double peak . ( B ) Su - perposition of 17 spectra on the second peak results in an exact cover of all but the (cid:222)rst peak . Gray lines are force extension curves calculated by the WLC model as in Fig . 2B . ( C ) Because loop F—G is cut out , force curves with a length of 45 nm can be recorded only when the free end of helix E is (cid:222)xed to the tip . Thus , the (cid:222)rst peak re(cid:223)ects extraction of helices D and E and the second re(cid:223)ects extraction and unfolding of helices B and C ; the last peak shows extraction of the last remaining helix A . Consequently , the intermediate peak between peaks 2 and 3 re - (cid:223)ects stepwise unfolding of helices A and B . 21 aa 8 aa 7 aa 71 aa 60 aa 88 aa 3 aa 1 aa 3 aa 9 aa 24 aa 17 aa helices loops 21 aa 25 aa 29 aa 23 aa 31 aa 26 aa Fig . 4 .

The transcription factor Lz ( Lozenge ) , which resembles human AML1 ( acute myeloid leukemia— 1 ) protein , is necessary for the development of crystal cells during embryonic and larval hematopoiesis . Another transcription factor , Gcm ( glial cells missing ) , has previously been shown to be required for plasmatocyte development . Misexpression of Gcm causes crystal cells to be transformed into plasmato - cytes . The Drosophila GATA protein Srp ( Serpent ) is required for both Lz and Gcm expression and is necessary for the development of both classes of hemocytes , whereas Lz and Gcm are required in a lineage - speci(cid:222)c manner . Given the similarities of Srp and Lz to mammalian GATA and AML1 proteins , observations in Drosophila are likely to have broad implications for under - standing mammalian hematopoiesis and leukemias . Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to all blood cell lineages in mammals ( 1 ) . Molecular deci - sions that differentiate one lineage from another are regulated by unique protein complexes con - stituted of general as well as lineage - specific transcription factors ( 2 ) . Gene inactivation stud - ies in mice have identified an important role for a number of hematopoietic transcription fac - tors . For example , GATA - 1 is required for ery - throid development ( 3 ) , GATA - 2 for definitive hematopoiesis ( 4 ) , and GATA - 3 for T cell de - velopment ( 5 ) . Interestingly , the Drosophila GATA homolog serpent ( srp ) is required for embryonic blood cell development ( 6 ) .

In contrast to the measurements in which we used unspeci(cid:222)c attachment , we also could resolve the substructure of the (cid:222)rst peak , which re(cid:223)ects unfolding of helices F and G .
