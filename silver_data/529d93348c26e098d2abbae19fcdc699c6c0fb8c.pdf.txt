In this chapter , we provide snapshots of current advances targeting quantitative correlation of the dynamic state of a biological pathway with high - resolution structural infor - mation in the same window of time and space . I . Introduction Complexity in cell biological processes has traditionally been tackled by a reductionist approach where the corresponding system is broken down into small isolated pieces so that the most relevant parts of the system and interactions among them can be identiﬁed and studied . The reductionist agenda assumes that knowing the behavior of the participating molecules is sufﬁcient for providing a mechanistic description of the behavior of the system . Indeed , a large body of work carried out over the past two decades has determined , at atomic resolution , minimal structural domains of protein components that in turn suggested pathways of assembly and organization . Although these high - resolution structural approaches pro - vide critical information about individual molecules , allowing ADVANCES IN PROTEIN CHEMISTRY AND 91 Copyright 2011 , Elsevier Inc .

DOI : 10 . 1016 / B978 - 0 - 12 - 386507 - 6 . 00004 - X interpolation into the inner workings of molecular assemblies , as the development of integrated system models requires in - depth understand - ing of all system components ; this knowledge becomes truly meaningful only if it can be related to the components working as an ensemble within a living cell . In this chapter , we describe how a newly developing hybrid approach that aims at seamlessly tying light and electron microcopy imaging techniques ( correlative light and electron microscopy , cLEM ; van Driel et al . , 2009 ) is being harnessed to allow structural integration of these molecular models at the organelle and cellular levels . Structural biology research is increasingly focusing on interpreting dy - namic biological processes and pathways by mining structural variations originating from the micro - , meso - , and macroscales . Toward this goal , spatial and functional correlation of data derived from live - cell imaging ( via light microscopy , LM ) with information derived from high - resolution transmission electron cryo - microscopy ( cryo - EM ) and cryo - tomography ( cryo - ET ) is indispensable . Live - cell imaging approaches , which combine LM with genetically or speciﬁcally combined ﬂuorophores , can track dynamically a set of proteins via multiplexing approaches to provide the means of following simultaneously multiple processes to derive the hierarchy and kinetics of the relations between activities . Cryo - EM or cryo - ET provides the ability to determine , in a fully hydrated state and in situ , the three - dimensional ( 3D ) structures of the underlying large , dynamic macromolecular assemblies that through structural adaptations govern these processes . Thus , cLEM is establishing approaches and technologies to systematically and quantitatively determine structure – function correlates in a physiologically relevant environment . II . Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy ( cLEM ) Implementation cLEM implementations can be divided into two tiers in terms of the level of correlative details . The ﬁrst tier consists of the identiﬁcation of regions of interest without correlative knowledge of the components , and the second tier includes direct localization of ﬂuorescent tags at the electron microscopy ( EM ) level which allows one to one correspondence between the ﬂuorophore and the assembly under investigation . 92 HANEIN AND VOLKMANN A . Convectional cLEM Correlative imaging between LM and conventional EM , which includes chemical ﬁxation and plastic embedding , has provided a wealth of infor - mation when used to visualize cell biology processes at various levels of detail ( Giepmans et al . , 2006 ) by integrating the strengths of LM and EM . Conventional cLEM has specialized in using ﬂuorescence - based functional assays with high - resolution characterization of selected regions in ﬁxed cells or organelles . A diverse ﬂuorescence toolbox for protein localization using cLEM and its correlation with functional outputs has been devel - oped throughout the years . The primary mode of correlation using conventional EM has been the use of probes that localize proteins at both the LM and EM levels , corresponding to the second tier mentioned above . Examples of one - to - one correspondence between the ﬂuorophore and the assembly under investigation include ﬂuorescence photoconver - sion and immuno - gold labeling ( Sosinsky et al . , 2007 ; Giepmans , 2008 ; Hoffmann et al . , 2010 ) . The use of electron tomography with these techniques allows obtaining the 3D distribution of these tags in the region of interest . Newly developed super - resolution imaging approaches like photoacti - vated localization microscopy ( PALM ) aim at overcoming the diffraction limited resolution of conventional LM and thus can localize macromole - cules within a few nanometers ( Betzig et al . , 2006 ; Hess et al . , 2006 ; Hell , 2009 ) . At present , the slow image acquisition mode which is intrinsic to the stochastic sampling necessitates chemical ﬁxation , opening the way to develop approaches to adopt these samples to conventional cLEM via additional staining steps . B . Cryo - cLEM Conventional cLEM requires chemical ﬁxation and staining of the sam - ples , which potentially introduces artifacts to the ultrastructure . The goal of Cryo cLEM is integrating live - cell imaging involving dynamic characteriza - tion of cellular outputs at limited spatial resolution ( LM ) , with high - resolu - tion characterization of selected regions of unﬁxed , fully hydrated whole cells ( EM ) . Obstacles toward utilizing cryo - cLEM include the development of suitable sample preparation procedures , the necessity to identify regions of interest in the cryopreserved state ( low signal - to - noise ratio as a CORRELATIVE LIGHT – ELECTRON MICROSCOPY 93 consequence of preventing beam damage ) , and the limited sample thick - ness amenable to the EM imaging ( (cid:1) 0 . 5 m m ) . Similar to conventional cLEM being enabled by advances made in developing compatible sample prepara - tion protocols , several enabling cryo - cLEM protocols are currently being established . The recent development of cryoLM stages enables spatial local - ization of ﬂuorescence signals at regions of interest in the cryopreserved sample ( recently reviewed in Briegel et al . , 2010 and more in details de - scribed in Sartori et al . , 2007 ; Schwartz et al . , 2007 ; Agronskaia et al . , 2008 ; Plitzko et al . , 2009 ; van Driel et al . , 2009 ; Rigort et al . , 2010 ) . Other novel developments in cryo - EM enabling techniques include cryo - ultramicrotomy and focused - ion beam micromachining for controlling sample thickness ( Al - Amoudi et al . , 2004 ; Mannella , 2006 ; Marko et al . , 2007 ; Rigort et al . , 2010 ) . Typically , cryo - cLEM has been employed in combination with cryo - tomography . The primary use of cryo - cLEM so far has been restricted to tier 1 , identiﬁcation of regions of interest in 3D . One possible enhancement of cryo - cLEM is the identiﬁcation of individual ﬂuorescence tags at EM resolu - tion ( Gruska et al . , 2008 ; Bouchet - Marquis and Hoenger , 2010 ) . III . Future Perspectives Detection at the EM level requires electron dense markers such as gold clusters or quantum dots . In contrast to ﬂuorescence tags , which can be genetically engineered into the cells under study , these EM markers need to be introduced into the cell by other means . In the context of cryo - cLEM , this fact constitutes an obstacle because the introduction of EM tags may interfere with the native state of the cell and / or distort its ultrastucture . We and others have begun to develop a new methodology that can potentially overcome this barrier for studying the ventral portion of cells . The protocol relies on a gentle unrooﬁng of the cell’s basal portion while maintaining the ventral membrane in a fully hydrated state . Comparison between ﬂuorescence signals before and after unroof - ing indicates that the 3D organization and immunogenicity of the under - lying components are preserved . The procedures have been employed in the characterization of macromolecular machineries involved in cell motility and adhesion ( Gupton et al . , 2005 ; Delorme et al . , 2007 ; Luxenburg et al . , 2007 ; Patla et al . , 2010 ) . In the context of cryo - cLEM , unrooﬁng would be followed by exposure to EM tags such as gold - labeled antibodies that recognize the ﬂuorescence tags , which is then followed by 94 HANEIN AND VOLKMANN cryo - plunging of the sample . Test applications of this protocol with nega - tively stained specimen show a very good correspondence between ﬂuo - rescence signals and the location of individual ﬂuorophores identiﬁed ( Fig . 1 ) . This application generated already information that was not obtainable without the tier - 2 cLEM approach by identifying the presence of tentative vinculin dimers within adhesion sites in situ . Further , the protocol results in ultrastructurally well - preserved , thin samples that allow high - ﬁdelity imaging and tomographic reconstruction at molecular resolution ( Fig . 2 ) . A . Functional cLEM Another regime of correlating LM and EM is the use of ﬂuorescence as a functional assay in conjunction with structural determination by EM . Generally , this approach entails harnessing the information derived from the LM level to arrest the system in a deﬁned functional state . For example , pyrene ﬂuorescence of actin serves as an indicator for ﬁlament polymerization ; the emitted pyrene ﬂuorescence increases during the initial polymerization phase and reaches a plateau upon equilibrium . The slope of the intensity curve correlates with rate of polymerization and addition of functional activators that promote actin nucleation such as Arp2 / 3 complex will increase the slope . If the same sample monitored by pyrene assay is subsequently imaged by EM , the pyrene assay can serve as quality indicator for the functional integrity of the EM sample . In addition , this correlative approach allows consistency in capturing a par - ticular functional state ( e . g . , equilibrium ) ( Egile et al . , 2005 ; Rouiller et al . , 2008 ) . Similar functional assays can be implemented in other contexts that involve correlation between structure and speciﬁc functional states . IV . Outlook The proof of principal for possible adaption of high - resolution oil - immersion LM microscopes with frozen hydrated samples ( Le Gros et al . , 2009 ) with advances in generating ﬂuorescent protein fusions ( Werner et al . , 2009 ) , advances of computer - controlled microscopes , digi - tal cameras , and aberration - reducing electron - optics will allow cryo - cLEM CORRELATIVE LIGHT – ELECTRON MICROSCOPY 95 to seamlessly integrate data that can span four orders of magnitude ( nanometers to tens of microns ) in length scale to allow establishing uniﬁed models of structure and function .
