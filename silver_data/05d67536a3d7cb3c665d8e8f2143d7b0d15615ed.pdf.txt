Using differential display analysis , we have identified radixin as a gene down - regulated in primary lung adenocarcinoma . Real - time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed that radixin mRNA was decreased , both in 10 early - stage bronchioloalveolar carcinomas and in 16 invasive lung adenocarcinomas , by 69 % ( p 5 0 . 0002 ) and 82 % ( p , 0 . 0001 ) , respectively , compared with 9 nontumor lung tissues . Similarly , moesin and ezrin mRNA levels were reduced in lung adenocarcinoma . Immunohistochemistry confirmed that cancer cells expressed very little radixin and moesin , whereas non - neoplastic alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells , and endothelial cells , including those within the tumor stroma , were consistently positive for these two proteins . Ezrin was localized in the apical surface of non - neoplastic bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells and , in contrast to radixin and moesin , the majority of tumor cells retained expression of ezrin . Localization of ezrin was altered in a significant proportion of tumor cells : whereas tumor cells forming lumina displayed membranous staining on the apical side , tumor cells with disorganized structures were either negative or diffusely positive for ezrin in the cytoplasm . Furthermore , a fraction of tumor cells invading the stroma in a scattered manner were strongly positive for ezrin . In conclusion , expression of radixin and moesin is down - regulated in lung adenocarcinoma , including early - stage bronchioloalveolar carcinoma . An intriguing implication of this finding is that these two genes may function as tumor suppressors in lung adenocarcinoma oncogenesis . Although structurally related to radixin and moesin , ezrin may have a distinct function in tumor - cell invasion . ( Lab Invest 2000 , 80 : 1643 – 1650 ) . O f the various malignant tumors , lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide . However the biological behavior of lung cancer is not fully characterized , and the outcome of surgical treat - ment remains unsatisfactory . Identification of genes that are involved in tumorigenesis and in the progres - sion of lung cancer will be required to formulate more effective therapies . One approach to the identification of such genes is to use differential display analysis ( Bauer et al , 1993 ; Liang and Pardee , 1992 ; Liang et al , 1992 , 1993 ; Sager et al , 1993 ; Yoshikawa et al , 1998 ) . Radixin is a member of the ERM ( ezrin / radixin / moesin ) family of proteins ( Mangeat et al , 1999 ; Sato et al , 1992 ) , which was first isolated as a constituent of adherence junctions in rat liver ( Tsukita and Hieda , 1989 ) . Ezrin was first purified as a component of intestinal microvilli that is tyrosine - phosphorylated by epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ; Bretscher , 1989 ) , and moesin was originally identified as a heparin - binding protein ( Lankes and Furthmayr , 1991 ) . The amino - terminal half of the ERM protein is about 85 % homologous , whereas homology in the carboxy - terminal half is about 65 % ( Mangeat et al , 1999 ) . The ERM proteins bind to actin filaments at their carboxy - terminal domain ( Algrain et al , 1993 ; Henry et al , 1995 ; Turunen et al , 1994 ) , and to several integral membrane proteins , such as CD43 , CD44 , and ICAM - 1 , - 2 , and - 3 , and so on , at their amino - terminal domains ( Heiska et al , 1998 ; Mangeat et al , 1999 ; Yonemura et al , 1998 ) . The ERM proteins are involved in a variety of cellular functions , such as cell adhesion , migration , and the organization of cell sur - face structures ( Bretscher et al , 1997 ; Mangeat et al , 1999 ; Martin et al , 1995 ; Sato et al , 1991 , 1992 ) . Although several authors have speculated that the ERM proteins may play a role in cancer ( Tsukita et al , 1994 ) , data concerning their expression in tumors are rather limited ( Akisawa et al , 1999 ; Ichikawa et al , 1998 ) . Interestingly , the neurofibromatosis 2 ( NF2 ) tumor suppressor gene encodes a protein ( merlin or schwannomin ) structurally related to the ERM family of proteins ( Rouleau et al , 1993 ; Trofatter et al , 1993 ) . Clusters of amino acids identical in merlin and in the ERM family are concentrated in the amino - terminal half of each molecule ( about 62 % identical ) ( Tsukita et al , 1993 ) . Overexpression of the NF2 gene in NIH3T3 cells decreases their growth rate , confirming the role of NF2 as a tumor suppressor ( Lutchman and Rou - Received May 25 , 2000 .

Merlin is down - regulated in sporadic and NF2 - related schwannomas ( Stemmer - Rachamimov et al , 1997 ) . In the present study , we used differential display analysis to identify genes differentially expressed in normal lung versus lung adenocarcinoma . Impor - tantly , we included 10 cases of noninvasive adenocar - cinoma ( early - stage bronchioloalveolar carcinoma ) , characterized by in situ growth of tumor cells along the alveolar walls ( Kawasaki et al , 1996 ; Kitamura et al , 1995 ; Noguchi et al , 1995 ) . These tumors have re - cently been identified as putative precursors of inva - sive lung adenocarcinoma ( Kawasaki et al , 1996 ; Kitamura et al , 1995 ; Noguchi et al , 1995 ) . Analysis of these tumors will allow identification of genes that are either up - or down - regulated in the course of tumor progression . We report here that radixin and , to a lesser extent , moesin are down - regulated both in noninvasive and invasive adenocarcinoma , suggest - ing that these two molecules may function as tumor suppressors . Results DifferentialDisplayAnalysis Differential display analysis was performed on RNA samples isolated from three noninvasive lung adeno - carcinomas ( localized bronchioloalveolar carcinomas ) , two invasive lung adenocarcinomas , and two nontu - morous lung tissues . Six downstream primers were used for the reverse transcription of DNase - treated total RNA and the resulting first - strand cDNA was subsequently PCR - amplified using a combination of 17 upstream primers and each of the 6 downstream primers . The differential display using the No 14 up - stream primer and the No 5 downstream primer iden - tified a cDNA fragment that was down - regulated in both noninvasive and invasive lung adenocarcinomas . Sequence analysis of the amplified fragment revealed that the cDNA was homologous to human radixin . ExpressionofERMmRNAinHumanLungAdenocarcinomasandNontumorLungTissues Next , expression of radixin mRNA was analyzed by real - time quantitative RT - PCR using a panel of total RNA extracted from 10 noninvasive lung adenocarci - nomas ( early - stage bronchioloalveolar carcinomas ) , 16 invasive lung adenocarcinomas , and 9 nontumor - ous lung tissues . As shown in Figure 1 , expression of radixin mRNA was decreased in both the 10 early - stage bronchioloalveolar carcinomas and the 16 inva - sive lung adenocarcinomas by 69 % ( p 5 0 . 0002 ) and 82 % ( p , 0 . 0001 ) , respectively , as compared with 9 nontumor lung tissues . We also studied expression of moesin and ezrin mRNAs in the same panel of RNA samples . We found that expression of ezrin was down - regulated by 46 % ( p 5 0 . 0033 ) in noninvasive lung adenocarcinoma and 76 % ( p , 0 . 0001 ) in inva - sive lung adenocarcinoma . Levels of moesin mRNA were also reduced in lung adenocarcinoma , but to a lesser extent compared with the reduction in radixin mRNA levels ( noninvasive : 44 % reduction , p 5 0 . 0071 ; invasive : 67 % reduction , p , 0 . 0001 ) . ImmunohistochemicalAnalysis Radixin , moesin , and ezrin were all expressed in normal alveolar and bronchial epithelium , and in vas - cular endothelial cells ( Fig . 2 ) . Weak to moderate staining was observed in the apical or luminal cell membranes . In bronchiolar epithelium the apical por - tion of the cytoplasm was also stained for radixin and moesin . In contrast most cancer cells were completely negative for radixin or moesin . In general we found no significant heterogeneity of tumor cells with regard to the expression of radixin and moesin . The only heter - ogeneity was found in a small fraction of cancer cells that were located in the periphery of the tumors ; in these cells , we observed weak staining for these two proteins . Unlike radixin or moesin , weak to moderate staining for ezrin was seen in most tumor cells ( Fig . 2 ) , except for one tumor , which was negative for ezrin ( Fig . 3B ) . Interestingly , localization of ezrin was altered in a significant proportion of tumor cells : whereas tumor cells forming luminal structures retained mem - branous staining on the apical side ( Fig . 3A ) , the majority of tumor cells were diffusely stained in the cytoplasm . This was especially evident in tumor cells with disorganized structures ( Fig . 3C ) . In addition we occasionally observed that cancer cells invading the fibrous stroma in a scattered manner were strongly stained for ezrin ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) . The results of these immunohistochemical examinations are summarized in Table 1 . Discussion In the present study , using differential display analysis , we identified a cDNA fragment that was down - regulated in lung adenocarcinoma . Sequence analysis showed that the cDNA was that of radixin , which belongs to the ERM protein family . RT - PCR analysis of a panel of lung adenocarcinoma and nontumor lung tissues showed that radixin was down - regulated in all noninvasive , as well as invasive , adenocarcinomas . Immunohistochemistry further showed that staining for radixin was markedly reduced in tumor cells , whereas non - neoplastic epithelial cells , as well as endothelial cells within the tumor stroma , strongly expressed radixin . Similarly , mRNA levels of moesin and ezrin were reduced in lung adenocarcinomas , although staining intensity for ezrin remained more or less the same as in normal tissue . These results suggest that mRNA expression of radixin and the other ERM proteins is reduced in the early oncogenic stages of lung adenocarcinoma , and that either trans - lational or post - translational control mechanisms may exist for expression of ezrin . Phosphorylation is one of the mechanisms that control the stability of proteins ( Ashcroft and Vousden , 1999 ) . Thus it would be inter - esting to see whether the phosphorylation status of ezrin is altered in lung adenocarcinomas as compared with nontumorous lung tissues . Tokunou et al 1644 Laboratory Investigation † November 2000 † Volume 80 † Number 11 Since the ERM proteins are involved in cell migra - tion , the down - regulation of the ERM proteins in lung adenocarcinoma was unexpected . However the fol - lowing findings point to the possibility that the ERM proteins may function as tumor suppressors . First , the NF2 protein ( merlin or schwannomin ) , which shares structural characteristics with the ERM family , func - tions as a tumor suppressor ( Rouleau et al , 1993 ; Trofatter et al , 1993 ) . Transfection of the NF2 gene suppressed a v - Ha - Ras - induced malignant pheno - type ( Tikoo et al , 1994 ) and inhibited the growth of NIH3T3 cells ( Lutchman and Rouleau , 1995 ) . Anti - sense oligodeoxynucleotides to the NF2 gene inhib - ited cell adhesion ( Huynh and Pulst , 1996 ) . Second , a new growth suppressor gene , designated DAL - 1 ( dif - ferentially expressed in adenocarcinoma of the lung ) , was recently isolated by differential display analysis . This gene belongs to the NF2 / ERM / 4 . 1 superfamily , and its expression is absent in a large proportion of primary non - small - cell lung carcinomas ( Tran et al , 1999 ) . In this respect it is interesting that the radixin gene is localized in 11q23 ( Wilgenbus et al , 1993 ) , one of the chromosomal regions commonly showing LOH in lung adenocarcinoma ( Iizuka et al , 1995 ; Rasio et al , 1995 ) . Chromosomal deletions in region 11q23 have been associated with various human tumors including breast ( Carter et al , 1994 ; Hampton et al , 1994 ; Laake et al , 1999 ; Negrini et al , 1995 ; Winqvist et al , 1995 ) , ovarian ( Foulkes et al , 1993 ) , uterine cervical ( Hamp - ton et al , 1994 ) , and colon ( Keldysh et al , 1993 ) cancer , malignant melanoma ( Herbst et al , 1995 ) , and lympho - proliferative disorder ( Stilgenbauer et al , 1996 ) . The introduction of normal human chromosome 11q into the A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line suppressed tumorigenicity in nude mice ( Parshad et al , 1992 ; Satoh et al , 1993 ) . The tumor suppressive function of 11q has also been demonstrated in the MCF - 7 breast carcinoma cell line ( Negrini et al , 1994 ) . Recently regions of allelic loss on chromosome 11q23 in lung cancer have been refined ( Wang et al , 1999 ) . The radixin gene is localized to one of the two minimal regions of loss identified ( Y . Arai , Cancer Genomics Division , National Cancer Center Research Institute , Tokyo , Japan , personal communication ) . In contrast to radixin and moesin , weak but signifi - cant staining for ezrin was observed in the majority of cancer cells . Interestingly , a diffuse cytoplasmic stain - ing pattern was often observed instead of the charac - teristic membranous staining pattern , especially in areas where tubular structures were disorganized . Moreover ezrin expression appeared to be strongly induced in tumor cells that invaded the stroma in a scattered manner . These observations suggest that ezrin may have a dual role . In cells with polarized structures , ezrin may regulate cell surface morpho - genesis as a membrane - cytoskeletal linker ( Algrain et al , 1993 ) . In cells responding to extracellular stimuli , such as EGF ( Bretscher , 1989 ) or HGF ( Crepaldi et al , 1997 ) , ezrin may be involved in the cytoskeletal reor - ganization required for migration and morphogenetic changes . In this respect it is of note that alternative Figure 1 . Real - time quantitative RT - PCR analysis .

Altered ERM Expression in Lung Adenocarcinoma Laboratory Investigation † November 2000 † Volume 80 † Number 11 1645 splicing and expression levels of CD44 , an ERM - binding membrane protein , correlate with tumor pro - gression ( Rudzki and Jothy , 1997 ) . It would be inter - esting to see whether the loss of membrane association of ezrin occurs in parallel with the loss of ezrin binding by CD44 and / or altered expression pat - tern of CD44 isoforms , and whether phosphorylation of ezrin plays a role in this process . Clearly further investigations are required to elucidate the potential roles of ezrin in cancer cell invasion . In summary we have found that radixin and moesin are down - regulated in lung adenocarcinoma , includ - ing early - stage bronchioloalveolar carcinoma , sug - gesting that these two molecules may function as tumor suppressors in the early oncogenic stages of lung adenocarcinoma . Expression of ezrin was also reduced in lung adenocarcinoma , but its altered local - ization in invading cancer cells points to its role in cell migration . The precise roles of the ERM proteins in cancer cells should be elucidated by further investigations . Materials and Methods PatientsandSamples Tumor samples were obtained from 26 patients , of whom 10 had noninvasive and 16 had invasive lung adenocarcinomas . All patients underwent complete resection of the tumors at the National Cancer Center Hospital , Japan . After surgical removal , samples of the tissues were stored in liquid nitrogen until they were used . The remaining tissues were fixed routinely in 10 % formalin and embedded in paraffin for patholog - ical examination . RNAIsolation Total RNA was isolated from frozen tissue using a RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , California ) . All RNA samples were treated with deoxyribonuclease I ( Ampli - fication Grade ; Life Technologies , Rockville , Maryland ) , following the instructions of the manufacturer . DifferentialDisplayAnalysis We carried out differential display analysis following a modified protocol described by Yoshikawa et al ( 1998 ) . Experiments were performed using a Fluores - cence Differential Display Kit Rhodamine version ( Code No . DS003 ; TaKaRa , Tokyo , Japan ) . Total RNA ( 250 ng ) was combined with a ROX ( carboxy - X - rhodamine ) labeled downstream primer , 10 3 RNA PCR buffer , 25 m M MgCl 2 , dNTP mixture , RNase inhibitor , AMV Reverse Transcriptase XL , and RNase free dH 2 O .

Altered ERM Expression in Lung Adenocarcinoma Laboratory Investigation † November 2000 † Volume 80 † Number 11 1647 40° C for 2 minutes , and 72° C for 1 minute for 21 cycles . The amplified fragments were separated with 2 % NuSieve 3 : 1 agarose gel containing HA Yellow ( TaKaRa ) and 2 % NuSieve 3 : 1 agarose gel containing HA Red ( TaKaRa ) . The fragments were sequenced using a Big Dye Cycle Sequencing FS Ready Reaction Kit ( Applied Biosystems / Perkin Elmer , Foster City , California ) in an ABI PRISM 377 Automated DNA sequencer ( Applied Biosystems / Perkin Elmer ) . The DNA sequences were evaluated by FASTA and BLAST computer programs at the National Center for Biotechnology Information . Primers Primers for radixin , moesin , and ezrin were designed using a computer program , Primer Express ( Applied Biosystems / Perkin Elmer ) . We conducted BLASTN searches against nr ( the nonredundant set of Gen - Bank , EMBL , and DDBJ database sequences ) to con - firm the total gene specificity of the nucleotide se - quences chosen for the primers . The primers used for real - time quantitative RT - PCR were : radixin , forward 5 ' - CGAGGAAGAACGTGTAACCGAA - 3 ' and reverse 5 ' - TCTTGGTTTCATCTCTGGCTTG - 3 ' ; moesin , for - ward 5 ' - TGTAAACCAGAGAGCTGCTGG - 3 ' and re - verse 5 ' - GAAGAGCACACATGAGACAGAGAA - 3 ' ; and ezrin , forward 5 ' - GTTTTCCCCAGTTGTAATAGT GCC - 3 ' and reverse 5 ' - TCCGTAATTCAATCAG TCCTGC - 3 ' . These primers were purchased from Greiner Japan ( Tokyo ) . GAPDH primers were pur - chased from Perkin - Elmer Applied Biosystems . Real - TimeQuantitativeRT - PCRAnalysis We carried out a real - time quantitative RT - PCR assay ( Gibson et al , 1996 ; Heid et al , 1996 ) based on SYBR Green fluorescence methodology to determine the relative abundance of radixin , moesin , and ezrin mR - NAs . All RT - PCR reactions were performed using an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector ( Applied Biosys - tems / Perkin Elmer ) . For each RT - PCR run , a master mix was prepared on ice with 10 3 SYBR PCR Buffer , 25 m M MgCl 2 , dNTP blend , AmpliTaq Gold , Multi - Scribe Reverse Transcriptase , RNase inhibitor , dH 2 O ( Applied Biosystems / Perkin Elmer ) . One microliter of the RNA samples was added to 49 m l of the RT - PCR master mix . The thermal cycling conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 48° C for 30 minutes , 95° C for 10 minutes , 40 cycles at 95° C for 15 seconds , and 60° C for 1 minute . Experiments were performed in triplicate for each data point . Each RT - PCR run included the five points of the standard curve ( 5 - fold serially diluted human control RNAs ) , a no - template control , and 35 RNA samples derived from 16 invasive lung adenocarcinomas , 10 small ( maxi - mum diameter 2 cm or less ) bronchioloalveolar carci - nomas , and 9 normal lung tissues . We quantified transcripts of the GAPDH as internal RNA controls , and each sample was normalized on the basis of its GAPDH content . ImmunohistochemicalAnalysis The tissue specimens were fixed in 10 % formalin , embedded in paraffin , and sliced into 3 - m m sections . Immunoperoxidase staining by the avidin - biotin - peroxidase complex method was performed with a Vectastain ABC kit ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , California ) . The sections were deparaffinized with graded ethanol and xylene , immersed for 30 minutes in methanol containing 0 . 3 % H 2 O 2 , and washed in phosphate - buffered saline ( pH 7 . 4 ) . After autoclaving , the sections were incubated for 10 minutes with normal swine serum to block nonspecific binding of the antibody . The sections were exposed to polyclonal goat anti - radixin antibody ( sc - 6408 , Santa Cruz Bio - technology ) at a dilution of 1 : 2000 , polyclonal goat anti - ezrin antibody ( sc - 6409 , Santa Cruz Biotechnol - ogy , Santa Cruz , California ) at a dilution of 1 : 200 , or polyclonal goat anti - moesin antibody ( sc - 6410 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) at a dilution of 1 : 2000 , at 4° C overnight . The sections were then incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature , and with the Vectastain ABC re - agent for 30 minutes . For visualization , sections were immersed in 0 . 05 % diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochlo - ride solution containing 0 . 01 % H 2 O 2 , and counter - stained lightly with hematoxylin .
