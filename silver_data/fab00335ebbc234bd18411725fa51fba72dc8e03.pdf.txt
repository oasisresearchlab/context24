INTRODUCTION Dystrophin is a 427 kDa membrane cytoskeletal protein with sequence homologies to the spectrin family of proteins . On the basis of these sequence homologies the protein can be divided into four distinct domains : The NH 2 - terminal actin binding domain is separated from the COOH - terminal Ca 2 + - binding , cysteine - rich and membrane - binding domains by a long series of spectrin - like triple - helical coiled coil repeats ( Koenig et al . , 1988 ) . The protein is believed to form a ﬂexible link between the actin cytoskeleton and the membrane and extracellular matrix via a membrane - associated glycoprotein complex . Lesions in the dystrophin gene , located on the X - chromosome , lead to the Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophies , charac - terised by elevated serum creatine kinase levels and progres - sive muscular weakness leading to death in the case of Duchenne patients , usually by the third decade . The absence of sufficient functional dystrophin in muscle ﬁbres results in disruptions to the cell membranes and consequent necrosis and loss of function ( Emery , 1987 ) . Utrophin is a 395 kDa protein with considerable sequence homology to dystrophin ( Tinsley et al . , 1992 ) . On the basis of this sequence homology , it has been predicted that utrophin , like dystrophin , is able to interact with the actin - based cytoskeleton via its NH 2 terminus and is anchored at the inner membrane leaﬂet by a dystrophin - associated glycoprotein complex ( DAG ) . Unlike dystrophin , the utrophin gene is located on chromosome 6 ( Love et al . , 1989 ) and may be able to replace dystrophin functionally , thus presenting a unique opportunity for potential treatment of sufferers of muscular dystrophy . Utrophin is present in normal muscle , in brain , at the neuro - muscular junctions of normal and dystrophic muscle , in the muscles and other tissues of the mdx and dy mice and in several cultured cell lines ( Nguyen thi Man et al . , 1991 , 1992 ; Khurana et al . , 1992 ; Ohlendieck et al . , 1991 ; Pons et al . , 1991 ; Love et al . , 1991 ) . Furthermore , like dystrophin , immunohistochemical studies reveal that utrophin is localised to the membrane ( Khurana et al . , 1992 ; Nguyen thi Man et al . , 1991 , 1992 ) and is associated with a glycoprotein complex , comprising subunits that are antigenically indistinguishable from those of the 63 Utrophin , or dystrophin - related protein , is an autosomal homologue of dystrophin . The protein is apparently ubiq - uitously expressed and in muscle tissues the expression is developmentally regulated . Since utrophin has a similar domain structure to dystrophin it has been suggested that it could substitute for dystrophin in dystrophic muscle . Like dystrophin , utrophin has been shown to be associated with a membrane - bound glycoprotein complex . Here we demonstrate that expressed regions of the predicted actin binding domain in the NH 2 terminus of utrophin are able to bind to F - actin in vitro , but do not interact with G - actin . The utrophin actin binding domain was also able to associate with actin - containing structures , stress ﬁbres and focal contacts , when microinjected into chick embryo ﬁbroblasts . The expressed NH 2 - terminal 261 amino acid domain of utrophin has an affinity for skeletal F - actin ( K d 19±2 . 8 m M ) , midway between that of the corresponding domains of a - actinin ( K d 4 m M ) and dystrophin ( K d 44 m M ) . Moreover , this utrophin domain binds to non - muscle actin with a ~ 4 - fold higher affinity than to skeletal muscle actin . These data ( together with those of Matsumura et al . ( 1992 ) Nature , 360 , 588 - 591 ) demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that utrophin is capable of performing a functionally equivalent role to that of dystrophin . The NH 2 terminus of utrophin binds to actin and the COOH terminus binds to the membrane associated glycoprotein complex , thus in non - muscle and developing muscle utrophin performs the same predicted ‘spacer’ or ‘shock absorber’ role as dys - trophin in mature muscle tissues . These data suggest that utrophin could replace dystrophin functionally in dys - trophic muscle .

Utrophin , therefore , is ideally suited to act as a func - tional replacement for dystrophin in dystrophic tissues . In developing or regenerating muscle tissues , utrophin can be detected at the plasma membrane before dystrophin , with utrophin localisation becoming gradually less distinct as dys - trophin levels increase ( Clerk et al . , 1993 ; Helliwell et al . , 1992 ; Khurana et al . , 1992 ; Takemitsa et al . , 1991 ) . In order for utrophin to replace dystrophin functionally , it must also form a connection to the underlying actin cytoskeleton . The expressed NH 2 - terminal domains of dystrophin have been shown to bind to F - actin in vitro ( Hemmings et al . , 1992 ; Way et al . , 1992b ) . Despite considerable sequence homology ( 80 % ) between the NH 2 termini of dystrophin and utrophin ( Tinsley et al . , 1992 ) , it has not been demonstrated that utrophin binds to actin . Since dystrophin and utrophin represent only a small fraction of total cellular protein , puriﬁcation protocols for both proteins ( Ervasti et al . , 1991 ; Matsumura et al . , 1993 ; Pons et al . , 1990 ) have not yielded sufficient material for thorough biochemical analyses . We have , therefore , chosen to produce the NH 2 - terminal domain of utrophin by bacterial expression . We report here the actin binding characteristics and intracellular targeting of the NH 2 - terminal actin binding domain of utrophin . MATERIALS AND METHODS Expression vector constructs The cloning , expression and puriﬁcation of dystrophin residues 1 - 246 ( DMD246 ) have been described previously ( Way et al . , 1992b ) . Utrophin residues 1 - 112 and 113 - 371 ( designated UTR112 and UTR113 - 371 respectively ) were expressed as non - fusion proteins using the pET vector pMW172 ( Way et al . , 1990 ) . Using the 5 ¢ utrophin clone ( 116 92 . 2 ; Tinsley et al . , 1992 ) as template , a DNA fragment encoding NH 2 - terminal residues 1 - 112 was produced using PCR , with a 5 ¢ primer containing an Nde I site and a 3 ¢ primer that extended the sequence by 5 nucleotides and included a TGA stop and Hin dIII site . This fragment was subcloned into the Nde I / Hin dIII sites of pMW172 to give pMW172 / UTR112 . UTR113 - 371 was con - structed using PCR from the adjacent 5 ¢ utrophin clone , 89 . 2 . A 5 ¢ primer extending the nucleotide sequence by 2 bases and an Nde I site , was used together with a 3 ¢ primer to generate a construct equivalent to utrophin residues 113 - 484 . UTR113 - 371 was generated by sub - cloning the PCR product after cleavage at Nde I / Hin dIII , using an endogenous Hin dIII site at residue 371 , into the Nde I / Hin dIII sites of pMW172 to give pMW172 / UTR113 - 371 . Residues 1 - 261 of utrophin ( UTR261 ) , the homologous construct to DMD246 ( utrophin contains a 15 amino acid insertion at the NH 2 terminus ) was expressed as a glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion protein in a pGEX - 2 vector ( Smith and Johnson , 1988 ) . Using the 5 ¢ human utrophin clone ( 89 . 2 ) as template , a DNA fragment encoding residues 114 - 261 was produced using PCR with a 5 ¢ primer containing a Bam HI site and a 3 ¢ primer containing an Eco RI site . This fragment was subcloned into the Bam HI / Eco RI sites of the pGEX - 2 expression vector ( pGEX - 2 / 114 - 261 ) . The 5 ¢ human utrophin clone ( 116 92 . 2 ) was then used as a PCR template to produce a DNA fragment encoding NH 2 - terminal residues 1 - 112 . The 5 ¢ and 3 ¢ primers used in this case produced Bam HI sites on both ends of this fragment ( the 3 ¢ primer also extended the sequence by 2 nucleotides ) , which was then inserted into the Bam HI site of the pGEX - 2 / 114 - 261 vector , thereby fusing the utrophin coding sequence in frame . The authenticity of the construct was determined by restriction mapping and PCR analysis across the entire utrophin coding sequence using the speciﬁc 116 92 . 2 5 ¢ and 89 . 2 3 ¢ primers . The junction of the two fragments produced a Bam HI site and resulted in the conservative substitution of threonine residue 113 for serine . A schematic representation of the extent of the various constructs is shown beneath the alignment in Fig . 6 . The ﬁdelity of all PCR - generated constructs was veriﬁed by sequencing . Expression and puriﬁcation of dystrophin and utrophin constructs Dystrophin residues 1 - 246 ( DMD246 ) was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) and puriﬁed as described previously ( Way et al . , 1992b ) . UTR112 and UTR113 - 371 were expressed in E . coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS following a 2 hour induction with 0 . 5 mM IPTG . Both constructs expressed in low yield and were recovered from the inclusion body fraction using the procedure of Nagai et al . ( 1985 ) as described by Way et al . ( 1990 ) with the following modiﬁ - cations ; 0 . 25 % deoxycholate was included in all but the ﬁnal washing steps and the resuspended pellets were sonicated each time in order to break up the cell debris . Final cleaned inclusion body preparations were taken up in 30 ml 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT ( Buffer A ) plus 8 M urea . After diluting the urea concen - tration to 6 M with Buffer A and centrifugation at 35 , 000 g for 30 minutes , the supernatant fractions were applied to a column of DEAE - Sephacel , previously equilibrated in Buffer A . UTR113 - 371 bound to DEAE - Sephacel and was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 500 mM in Buffer A . UTR112 did not bind to DEAE , the pooled ﬂow - through fractions were applied to a column of CM - Sephadex and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 500 mM in Buffer A . Suitable column fractions ( as determined by SDS - PAGE ) were pooled and dialysed against Buffer A containing 4 M , 2 M , 1 M and 0 . 5 M urea , and then into Buffer A containing 200 mM NaCl , for at least 3 hours in each buffer . UTR113 - 371 was ﬁnally dialysed into Buffer A at pH 9 . 0 . E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) containing the pGEX / UTR261 - GST plasmid were grown overnight and expression was induced by the addition of 0 . 5 mM IPTG for 2 hours , cells were recovered by centrifugation and lysed by lysozyme treatment . The UTR261 - GST fusion protein was recovered from the supernatant fraction of cellular extracts and puriﬁed on DEAE - Sephacel in Buffer A , as described above . The GST portion was removed from UTR261 - GST by thrombin digestion ( 1 : 2000 , 21 hours at 37˚C ) in Buffer A containing 2 . 5 mM CaCl 2 . The digest was dialysed against Buffer A and centrifuged at 25 , 000 g for 10 minutes before being applied to DEAE - Sephacel in Buffer A as described above . All puriﬁed expressed proteins were subjected to gel ﬁltration chromatography on Sephacryl S - 200 to obtain a monomeric fraction , concentrated on Amicon Diaﬂo PM10 membranes or Centricon 10 micro - concentrators ( where necessary ) and clariﬁed by centrifugation at 424 , 000 g for 15 minutes . Protein concentrations were calculated from A 280 values using extinction coefficients for cysteine , tryptophan and tyrosine ( Mach et al . , 1992 ) . e 280 M - 1 cm - 1 values for expressed constructs are : DMD246 , 51 , 988 ; UTR112 , 7 , 020 ; UTR113 - 371 , 40 , 774 ; UTR261 , 39 , 160 . UTR261 - GST and GST alone , for use in microinjection studies , were expressed and puriﬁed essentially as described by Smith and Johnson ( 1988 ) : overnight cultures of pGEX - 2 / UTR261 in E . coli strain MC1061 were diluted 1 : 10 and following a further incubation ( 1 hour at 37˚C ) , expression was induced by the addition of IPTG ( 0 . 1 mM ) . After a further 3 hours at 37˚C , cells were harvested , lysed , and the protein was isolated by binding to glutathione agarose beads . Puriﬁed protein was eluted in 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 0 , 10 mM NaCl , 5 mM reduced glutathione , suitable for direct microinjection . Protein concentrations were determined by A 280 as described above . Protein purity was checked on SDS - PAGE and determined to be > 98 % in all cases . Actin puriﬁcation Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared from acetone powder ( MacLean - Fletcher and Pollard , 1980 ) as described by Maciver et al . ( 1991 ) , with some further modiﬁcations . Acetone powder was extracted only once before centrifugation and ﬁltration . Once ﬁltered S . J . Winder and others 65 Utrophin actin binding domain the solution was adjusted to 2 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 8 M KCl and stirred slowly for 30 minutes at 4˚C . Resulting F - actin was recovered by cen - trifugation ( 96 , 000 g , 4˚C for 2 hours ) before dialysis against 3 changes of G buffer ( 2 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM NaN 3 ) over three days . G - actin was clariﬁed by centrifugation , as described above , and applied to a column of Sephacryl S - 200 in the same buffer . The peak and trailing fractions were pooled and concentration was determined by e 290 = 0 . 0264 m M - 1 cm - 1 . Pyrene - labelled skeletal G - actin was prepared as described by Pollard ( 1984 ) . Non - muscle actin was prepared from expired human platelets ( East Anglia Blood Transfusion Service , Cambridge , UK ) . Approximately 20 g of packed platelets were stirred on ice for 15 minutes in acetone containing 1 mM PMSF . Platelets were ﬁltered through Whatman no . 41 ﬁlter paper and washed 3 times with 30 ml of ice - cold acetone each time . After the ﬁnal wash , the platelets were dried overnight , weighed , and processed as for skeletal actin , described above . Minor contaminants in the ﬁnal platelet actin preparation contributed signiﬁcantly to A 290 measurements , platelet actin concentration therefore , was determined by densitometric scanning ( Molecular Dynamics Computing Densitometer 300A ) of platelet actin and known concentrations of skeletal muscle actin on SDS - polyacrylamide gels . F - actin binding assays F - actin binding was assessed by sedimentation in a Beckman TL100 benchtop ultracentrifuge ( 15 minutes , 386 , 000 g , 4˚C ) , using ~ 12 m M F - actin in 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT and either 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 or 1 mM EGTA ( Winder and Walsh 1990 ) . For actin binding experiments with UTR113 - 371 , NaCl was omitted and the pH increased to 9 . 0 to prevent precipitation of UTR113 - 371 . Data were quantiﬁed by volume integration of SDS - polyacrylamide gels on a Molecular Dynamics 300A scanning densitometer . The amount of protein bound to actin was calculated from the known concentrations of proteins in the assay and the ratios of each protein in the supernatant and pellet , with corrections for trapping , as described previously ( Way et al . , 1992a , b ) . Statistical analysis was by Student’s t - test . Falling - ball vis - cometry was performed as described by MacLean - Fletcher and Pollard ( 1980 ) . Final F - actin concentrations of 5 m M and 10 m M were used to examine the effects of increasing concentrations of UTR261 on severing and crosslinking of actin ﬁlaments respectively . Actin polymerisation assays The effect of UTR261 on actin polymerisation kinetics was measured by observing the change in pyrene - labelled actin ﬂuorescence during polymerisation of 7 . 5 m M G - actin in the presence or absence of 15 m M UTR261 . Polymerisation was initiated by the addition of KCl , MgCl 2 and EGTA to 50 mM , 0 . 1 mM and 0 . 1 mM , respectively . Flu - orescence was monitored in a Perkin Elmer LS 50B Luminescence Spectrometer . G - actin binding assays The interaction of UTR261 with G - actin was assessed by gel ﬁltra - tion of 1 : 1 stoichiometric mixtures of UTR261 with either G - actin with ATP bound ( ATP - actin ) or G - actin with ADP bound ( ADP - actin ; Pollard , 1986 ) as compared to either UTR261 or G - actin alone . Gel ﬁltration was carried out at room temperature on a Sephacryl S - 200 column equilibrated with G - buffer ( 2 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM NaN 3 ) . In a separate exper - iment , 0 . 5 mg UTR261 was ﬁrst chromatographed on a Sephacryl S - 200 column equilibrated with G - buffer and a second sample of UTR261 was chromatographed on a Sephacryl S - 200 column equili - brated with F - buffer ( G - buffer containing 50 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EGTA ) . Protein elution proﬁles were monitored at A 280 . Cell culture and microinjection Chick embryo ﬁbroblasts ( CEF ) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Minimal Essential Medium , supplemented with 10 % tryptose phosphate broth , 5 % newborn calf serum and 1 % chick serum . Cells were seeded on glass coverslips at least 3 days prior to injection . All coverslips were etched with a cross , to aid relocation of the injected cells . Living CEF cells were microinjected with UTR261 - GST or GST essentially as described by Graessman et al . ( 1980 ) . Approximately 50 cells were each injected with 10 - 10 ml ( 1 - 10 % of cell volume ; Kreis and Birch - meier 1982 ) of each protein ( 2 mg / ml ) . Following injection , cells were returned to a 37˚C incubator for 40 minutes prior to ﬁxing and immunostaining . Immunostaining and microscopy Cells were ﬁxed in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS : pH 7 . 0 ) and permeabilised in 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 / PBS . Cells injected with UTR261 - GST or GST alone were stained with a rabbit polyclonal anti - GST antibody ( a generous gift from Dr E . Moiseyeva , University of Leicester , Leicester , UK ) diluted 1 in 10 , and a Texas Red - labelled goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( Amersham , UK ) . F - actin containing structures were visualised by staining with FITC - phalloidin ( Sigma ) . Where cells were double stained for vinculin and UTR261 - GST , a mouse monoclonal anti - vinculin antibody ( V284 , a generous gift from Dr J . M . Wilkinson , Wellcome Trust , London , UK ) , diluted 1 in 200 , was used with a Texas Red - labelled sheep anti - mouse Ig secondary antibody for vinculin detection , and an FITC - labelled goat anti - rabbit Ig secondary antibody for detection of the anti - GST antibody . Endogenous a - actinin was visualised by staining with a rabbit anti - chicken smooth muscle a - actinin polyclonal antibody ( Jackson et al . , 1988 ) diluted 1 in 50 , and a Texas Red - labelled goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody . All antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin and 0 . 02 % azide and all secondary antibodies were used at a 1 in 50 dilution . Fixed and stained cells were viewed on a Bio - Rad MRC 600 confocal imaging system using a · 63 lens . Photographs were taken on Kodak Technical Pan ﬁlm ( 50 ASA ) and exposed for the same length of time for each double - labelled pair . RESULTS Interaction of utrophin with F - actin The UTR261 - GST fusion protein expressed in very high yield and was shown to bind F - actin . UTR261 was easily separated from the GST - fusion protein by thrombin cleavage and recovered in soluble form at high concentration . Typical yields were ~ 200 mg / litre of culture . The partial utrophin actin binding domain proteins ( UTR112 and UTR113 - 371 ) were both recovered in soluble form from the inclusion body fraction of E . coli lysates . Whilst both these proteins bound to F - actin , it was only possible to partially purify UTR112 and yields were insufficient to achieve saturable binding in F - actin binding assays . Partially puriﬁed UTR112 remained soluble following sed - imentation ( Fig . 1A , lane 1 ) . UTR112 ( lowest of the three bands , UTR112 was identiﬁed as the prominent 13 kDa band that appeared in the total cell lysate following IPTG induction ) bound quite tightly to actin and was recovered almost entirely in the pellet fraction ( Fig . 1A , lane 4 ) whilst co - purifying proteins remained in the supernatant . UTR113 - 371 was highly soluble ( Fig . 1B , lane 3 ) and bound weakly to actin ( Fig . 1B , lane 2 ) . Densitometric analysis of SDS - polyacrylamide gels of UTR113 - 371 binding to actin ( Fig . 1C ) showed a maximum 66 binding of UTR113 - 371 to actin at ~ 1 mol UTR113 - 371 / mol F - actin with an affinity ( interpolated from 50 % maximum binding ) of 275 m M . Similar results were obtained in the presence or absence of calcium . As determined by sedimentation assay , UTR261 bound to skeletal muscle actin in the presence of Ca 2 + . Identical results were achieved in the absence of Ca 2 + ( presence of EGTA ) as has been shown for the homologous dystrophin protein DMD246 ( Way et al . , 1992b ) . pH ( range 6 . 0 - 9 . 0 ) and salt con - centration ( 0 - 100 mM ) had little effect on the binding of UTR261 to actin . Similarly , the binding of UTR261 and DMD246 to platelet actin were calcium - independent ( data not shown ) . Densitometric analysis of pellet and supernatant fractions from the sedimentation assay on SDS - polyacrylamide gels , showed maximum binding of UTR261 to both platelet and skeletal muscle actin at ~ 2 moles of UTR261 per mole of actin ( Fig . 2 ) . Scatchard analysis of these data ( Fig . 2 inset ) , revealed that UTR261 bound to platelet actin with signiﬁcantly ( P < 0 . 001 ) ~ 4 - fold higher affinity ( 5±1 m M ) than to skeletal muscle actin ( 19±2 . 8 m M ) . DMD246 also bound to platelet actin with ~ 4 - fold higher affinity ( 13±2 . 3 m M ) than to skeletal muscle actin ( 44 m M ; Way et al . , 1992 ) . Whilst UTR261 bound to skeletal actin with 2 . 3 - fold higher affinity than DMD246 , it also bound to platelet actin with a 2 . 6 - fold higher affinity than DMD246 . These results suggest that utrophin has an overall greater affinity for F - actin than dystrophin . Falling - ball viscometry of actin at either 5 m M or 10 m M in the presence of increasing concentrations of UTR261 ( Fig . 3A ) indicated that UTR261 did not crosslink , cap or sever actin ﬁlaments . These data are also consistent with UTR261 being unable to sequester actin monomers and as such having no effect on the critical concentration of actin . Interaction of utrophin with G - actin With a 2 - fold molar excess of UTR261 to actin there was no signiﬁcant effect of UTR261 on the polymerisation kinetics of pyrene - labelled actin ( Fig . 3B ) . A slight increase in initial polymerisation was observed , probably a result of dimer sta - bilisation , as UTR261 does not bind G - actin with high affinity ( see Fig . 4 ) or sever actin ﬁlaments ( Fig . 5A ) . A similar effect has been reported for myosin S1 ( Tawada and Oosawa , 1969 ) . S . J . Winder and others Fig . 1 . Binding of UTR112 and UTR113 - 371 to actin . ( A ) 15 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel of partially puriﬁed UTR112 ( ~ 20 m g / ml ) subjected to sedimentation in the absence ( lanes 1 and 2 ) and presence ( lanes 3 and 4 ) of F - actin ( 13 . 7 m M ) . UTR112 is the lowest of the three prominent bands . ( B ) 15 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel of UTR113 - 371 ( 520 m M ) subjected to sedimentation in the presence ( lanes 1 and 2 ) and absence ( lanes 3 and 4 ) of F - actin ( 13 . 7 m M ) . Samples were separated by an empty lane for clarity . ( C ) Actin binding curves for UTR113 - 371 binding to F - actin in the presence of calcium . Increasing concentrations of UTR113 - 371 ( 5 - 520 m M ) were mixed with F - actin ( 13 . 7 m M ) . Following a 10 minute incubation at room temperature samples were sedimented in an ultracentrifuge . Supernatant and pellet fractions were analysed by 15 % SDS - PAGE and densitometry as described in Materials and Methods . Bound UTR113 - 371 is expressed as a molar ratio per F - actin monomer . Saturation of UTR113 - 371 binding to skeletal F - actin was achieved at a ratio of 1 . 3 UTR113 - 371 : 1 actin monomer . The affinity interpolated from 50 % binding was determined to be 275 m M . Fig . 2 . Actin binding curves ( main graph ) and derived Scatchard plots ( inset ) for UTR261 binding to skeletal muscle actin ( (cid:115) ) and to platelet actin ( (cid:100) ) . Skeletal actin ( 12 m M ) was mixed with increasing concentrations of UTR261 from 0 . 1 - 425 m M . Platelet actin ( 10 m M ) was mixed with UTR261 ( 0 . 1 - 125 m M ) . Following a 10 minute incubation at room temperature samples were sedimented in an ultracentrifuge . Supernatant and pellet fractions were analysed by 15 % SDS - PAGE and densitometry as described previously by Way et al . ( 1992a ) . Bound UTR261 is expressed as a molar ratio per F - actin monomer . Saturation of UTR261 binding to both skeletal and platelet F - actin was achieved at a ratio of 2 UTR261 : 1 actin monomer ( main graph ) . Scatchard analysis of the binding data ( inset ) revealed that UTR261 bound to skeletal and non muscle actins with affinities of 19±2 . 8 m M ( R = 0 . 79 ) and 5±1 m M ( R = 0 . 76 ) , respectively . 67 Utrophin actin binding domain Furthermore , the number of ﬁlament ends , determined by the rate of polymerisation of G - actin added at steady state , was equal in the presence or absence of UTR261 ( data not shown ) . The decrease in polymerisation rate seen after ~ 700 seconds is probably due to a slight decrease in the actin monomer on rate in the presence of UTR261 ( data not shown ) . Although the data from falling - ball experiments ( Fig . 5A ) suggested indirectly that UTR261 was incapable of binding monomeric actin , we explored the possibility of a high affinity interaction between UTR261 and G - actin by gel ﬁl - tration . UTR261 and G - actin ran at their true monomeric molecular masses on a calibrated column of Sephacryl S - 200 . If UTR261 interacted with either ATP - actin or ADP - actin , one would expect a reduction in the absorbance around fraction 23 ( Fig . 4A ) , the UTR261 elution point , and / or a shift in the apparent actin elution point ( fractions 19 and 20 ) to a lower fraction number . As can be seen from Fig . 4A , this was not the case for either ATP - actin or ADP - actin . The UTR261 / ATP - actin elution proﬁle showed a sharp peak at fraction 20 ( actin ) and a prominent shoulder at fraction 23 ( UTR261 ) characteristic of the individual proteins . The UTR261 / ADP - actin elution proﬁle similarly showed two peaks , at fractions 20 and 23 , of actin and UTR261 , respec - tively . Furthermore , UTR261 also ran as a monomer under F - actin binding conditions ( F - buffer ) with only a slight shift ( 1 fraction later ) in elution time compared to G - buffer ( Fig . 4B ) . Under these conditions it is clear that UTR261 does not bind to G - actin with high affinity in either its ATP - bound or ADP - bound forms and is a monomer under both G - and F - buffer conditions . Intracellular localisation of microinjected UTR261 - GST Endogenous a - actinin was detected in CEF cells with an antibody to chicken smooth muscle a - actinin , and as expected , localised to actin - containing stress ﬁbres and focal contacts ( Fig . 5A , B ; Jackson et al . , 1988 ) . CEF cells microinjected with GST alone showed no distinct targeting of GST ( Fig . 5D ) when compared to localisation of actin - containing structures ( Fig . 5C ) . Cells microinjected with the UTR261 - GST fusion protein and visualised with an antibody against the GST part of the molecule , showed a clear localisation of UTR261 - GST to actin - containing structures . UTR261 - GST was localised to actin stress ﬁbres ( Fig . 5E , F ) and was also associated with focal contacts as shown by the co - localisation with vinculin ( Fig . 5G , H ) . Vinculin staining was limited to the tips of stress ﬁbres ( Fig . 5G ) in the region of the focal contacts , and UTR261 - GST staining was evident down the length of the stress ﬁbres extending to the very tip of the stress ﬁbre in the vinculin - containing region ( Fig . 5H ) . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 15 20 25 30 ADP - Actin / UTR ATP - Actin / UTR UTR261Actin A b s o r b a n ce ( 280 n m ) Fraction Number A 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 15 20 25 30 G - buffer F - buffer A b s o r b a n ce ( 280 n m ) Fraction Number B Fig . 3 .

F l uo r esce n ce ( a r b i t r a r y un i t s ) 68 DISCUSSION Binding studies using whole puriﬁed dystrophin conﬁrmed that the native molecule does bind to actin ( Ervasti and Campbell , 1993 ; Fabbrizio et al . , 1993 ; Senter et al . , 1993 ) . Using molecular approaches to express regions of the NH 2 - terminal actin binding domains of dystrophin , utrophin and a - actinin , it has been possible to localise the actin binding sites to certain regions of these domains .

As nomenclature of these subdomains is not consistent , we have renamed them actin binding sites ( ABS ) 1 , 2 and 3 from NH 2 - to COOH - terminal , respectively . ABS1 ( Levine et al . , 1990 , 1992 ; Fabbrizio et al . , 1993 ) or the NH 2 terminus of A domain ( de Arruda et al . , 1990 ) is the shortest ( 10 residues ) but most highly conserved ABS , sharing 80 % similarity between the four proteins . a - Actinin ( Hemmings et al . , 1992 ; Kuhlman et al . , 1992 ; Way et al . , 1992a ) , dystrophin ( Fabbrizio et al . , 1993 ) and utrophin ( herein ) constructs lacking this ABS are still able to bind to actin , some without any apparent reduction in affinity . ABS2 is the largest of these sites ( 28 residues long , 78 % similarity between the four proteins ) and is found in a diverse group of actin binding proteins ( de Arruda et al . , 1990 ) . In Dic - tyostelium ABP - 120 , this site has been shown to be sufficient and necessary for actin binding ( Bresnick et al . , 1990 , 1991 ) . Similarly with a - actinin , both in vitro assays ( Kuhlman et al . , 1992 ; Way et al . , 1992a ) and transfection studies ( Hemmings et al . , 1992 ) indicate that ABS2 is essential for actin binding . Furthermore , NH 2 - terminal dystrophin constructs lacking this domain and ABS1 ( but containing ABS3 ) were not able to bind to actin ( Winder and Kendrick - Jones , unpublished observa - tions ) . Conversely , a dystrophin - fusion protein lacking ABS2 but containing ABS1 was able to bind actin with higher affinity than proteins containing ABS1 + ABS2 or ABS1 + 2 + 3 ( Fabbrizio et al . , 1993 ) . Utrophin residues 1 - 112 containing ABS1 and the ﬁrst eight residues of ABS2 bound to actin quite tightly . The adjacent region ( residues 113 - 371 ) comprising the COOH - terminal 20 residues of ABS2 and all of ABS3 also bound to actin but with low affinity . ABS3 ( B domain ; de Arruda et al . , 1990 ; ABS2 ; Levine et al . , 1992 ) is the least conserved and least studied of these domains . Peptides corre - sponding to this site were shown to interact with actin by proton NMR ( Levine et al . , 1992 ) . A dystrophin fragment con - taining only ABS3 did not interact with actin ( results not shown ) nor did a similar region from a - actinin ( Way et al . , 1992a ) . ABS1 , 2 and 3 contain a majority of basic and hydrophobic amino acids , and whilst the removal of one or other of these sites may not have a great effect on the ability of the whole domain to bind actin , each site taken in isolation appears to be able to interact with actin to some extent . It is most likely that in the folded conformation of this domain , all three sites are involved in binding to actin ( Fabbrizio et al . , 1993 ) , although only elucidation of the three - dimensional structure of this or a related domain will answer these questions unequivocally . It must be remembered , however , that all the studies mentioned above , have addressed the ability of discrete domains , peptides or fusion and non - fusion proteins , to bind to actin . The affinity of the whole molecule or a higher - order multimer for actin may be much higher ( or lower ) than the domain in isolation . Fabbrizio et al . ( 1993 ) have demonstrated that dystrophin ABS1 and ABS3 can be crosslinked to distinct regions on actin , whereas ABS2 was not crosslinked , suggesting a differ - ence between the binding of a - actinin and dystrophin to actin . Utrophin binding to actin , 2 mol utrophin / mol actin , represents another difference between this closely related group of proteins . This observed stoichiometry may reﬂect the simulta - neous binding of two distinct subdomains ( only two subdo - mains of dystrophin are crosslinked to actin ; Fabbrizio et al . , 1993 ) from two UTR261 molecules to their respective subdo - mains on one F - actin monomer . The equivalent and highly similar domains of a - actinin and dystrophin bound to actin with a stoichiometry of 1 : 1 ( Way et al . , 1992a , b ) . UTR261 is a monomer under G - actin and F - actin salt conditions ( Fig . 4B ) , and it is not able to crosslink actin ﬁlaments ( Fig . 5A ) . This raises several possibilities regarding the binding and orienta - tion of the utrophin NH 2 terminus on actin . Whilst it is clear that dystrophin dimers can be seen in the EM ( Pons et al . , 1990 ; Sato et al . , 1992 ) there is no direct evidence to suggest that these are parallel or antiparallel dimers . With two utrophin NH 2 termini bound per actin , the two utrophin domains could either come from one dimer ( parallel ) or from two dimers ( antiparallel ) whose NH 2 termini are in close proximity . Given , however , that the stoichiometry of two utrophins per actin was obtained under saturating binding conditions and that the binding was non - cooperative it is arguable that in vivo there may be insufficient utrophin to achieve this stoichiometry . The demonstrated ability of the NH 2 terminus of utrophin to bind to actin in vitro and in vivo is a clear indication that utrophin may be able to replace dystrophin functionally in dys - trophic muscle . Utrophin is capable , via its COOH - terminal domain , of binding to an apparently identical DAG to that which dystrophin is anchored ( Matsumura et al . , 1992 ) and , via its NH 2 terminus , of binding to actin . Thus , utrophin is capable of forming a direct functional link between the actin cytoskele - ton and via the DAG and laminin , the extracellular matrix ( Ervasti and Campbell , 1993 ) .

Further - more , we have now shown that homologous NH 2 - terminal domains of both dystrophin and utrophin ( DMD246 and UTR261 , respectively ) bind to platelet actin ( the cytoplasmic b - isoform of actin ) with an apparent ~ 4 - fold higher affinity than to skeletal ( a - isoform ) actin . These data suggest that in muscle cells , dystrophin and utrophin do not form a functional link to the contractile apparatus as has been suggested ( Brown and Lucy , 1993 ) but that the associations of dystrophin and utrophin are wholly within the submembrane cytoskeletal domain . The levels of b - actin mRNA in skeletal muscle are low and peripherally located ( Kislauskis et al . , 1993 ) , i . e . in the submembrane region . Whilst b - actin protein levels may also be low , as are dystrophin and utrophin , given their respec - tive locations in the same cellular compartment , they are likely to interact functionally . The inability of utrophin to bind to G - actin with high affinity conﬁrms the lack of effect of utrophin in the regulation of actin polymerisation kinetics and further points to the utrophin - ( and dystrophin - ) actin interaction being solely structural . Utrophin and dystrophin bind to ﬁlamentous actin in the submembrane cytoskeleton as an anchor , with important regulatory events probably taking place at the utrophin / dystrophin DAG / membrane interfaces . Clearly , in non - muscle cells that contain dystrophin ( neurons ) and utrophin ( neurons and many other cell types ) , there is no a - ( skeletal muscle ) actin isoform present and dystrophin or utrophin could only bind to the b - ( cytoplasmic ) isoform of actin . The higher affinity of the actin binding domains in these two proteins for the b - isoform of actin probably reﬂects the importance of this interaction in non - muscle cells and muscle cells . Mutations in the dystrophin gene leading to dysfunction of the protein result in a perturbation of this membrane cytoskeleton linkage , causing membrane damage , with conse - quent changes in Ca 2 + homeostasis ( McArdle et al . , 1992 ; Turner et al . , 1991 ) and osmotic stability ( Menke and Jockusch , 1991 ) , as well as the well documented leakage of creatine kinase from damaged muscle cells with associated necrosis and loss of function . Despite the large size of the utrophin gene ( ~ 1 Mb ; Pearce et al . , 1993 ) no lesion in this gene has yet been identiﬁed , leading to the suggestion that utrophin is essential and any mutations may be lethal ( Tinsley and Davies , 1993 ) . If a suitable muscle - speciﬁc promoter were found that could be used to up - regulate utrophin expression speciﬁcally there would be a greater chance of therapeutic intervention . To that end , these and ongoing studies will help deﬁne the precise functional roles for dystrophin and utrophin in muscle and non - muscle cells .
