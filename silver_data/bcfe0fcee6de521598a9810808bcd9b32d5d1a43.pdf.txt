ARTICLES Using temperature to analyse temporal dynamics in the songbird motor pathway Michael A . Long 1 & Michale S . Fee 1 Many complex behaviours , like speech or music , have a hierarchical organization with structure on many timescales , but it is not known how the brain controls the timing of behavioural sequences , or whether different circuits control different timescales of the behaviour . Here we address these issues by using temperature to manipulate the biophysical dynamics in different regions of the songbird forebrain involved in song production . We find that cooling the premotor nucleus HVC ( formerly known as the high vocal centre ) slows song speed across all timescales by up to 45 per cent but only slightly alters the acoustic structure , whereas cooling the downstream motor nucleus RA ( robust nucleus of the arcopallium ) has no observable effect on song timing . Our observations suggest that dynamics within HVC are involved in the control of song timing , perhaps through a chain - like organization . Local manipulation of brain temperature should be broadly applicable to the identification of neural circuitry that controls the timing of behavioural sequences and , more generally , to the study of the origin and role of oscillatory and other forms of brain dynamics in neural systems . Motor behaviours are built out of a sequence of movements that evolve through time . From the most basic , such as locomotion , to themostcomplex , suchasplayingthepiano , thetimingofmovements is crucial . For some simple oscillatory behaviours , in which the move - ment evolves on a single timescale , it has been possible to identify the particularneuronsandbiophysicsthatcontrolthetemporaldynamicsofthebehaviour—forexamplepacemakerneuronsinthestomato - gastric ganglion 1 or the oscillator network that controls swimming in the leech 2 . However , it is not known what mechanisms underlie more complex learned behaviours that have structure on many timescales . Birdsong has a remarkably precise and hierarchically organized temporal structure 3 , 4 mediated by a number of distinct , well - studied motor nuclei 5 , 6 ( Fig . 1a ) , allowing for an unprecedented view into the central control of motor timing . Adult zebra finches generate a 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 - s song motif that is repeated a number of times during a bout of singing 7 . The motif itself is made up of song syllables—individual bursts of sound that are approximately 100ms in length and occur in a precise order . Syllables are highly stereotyped and often contain complex acoustic structure that can evolve rapidly ( 10 - ms timescale ) . The duration of song elements at all timescales is stereotyped ; trial - to - trial fractional variations in song timing are roughly 1 % ( refs 8 – 10 ) z . It is not known whether different brain regions are responsible for the timing of motifs , syllables , and subsyllabic structure . Two fore - brain nuclei in particular have been implicated in the control of the temporal structure of song : HVC and RA . HVC projects to RA , which in turn projects to the vocal motor neurons 11 as well as midbrain vocal control and brainstem respiratory areas 12 . Previous electrophysio - logicalstudieshavefoundevidencethatthesebrain regions contribute to song structure in a hierarchical manner 13 , 14 and have suggested that the dynamics underlying the generation of different song timescales may reside in different brain regions . For instance , syllable - timescale dynamicshavebeensuggestedtooccurinHVC 15 , whereassubsyllable - timescale dynamics may arise in RA 14 , 16 , 17 . Additionally , portions of the midbrain and respiratory areas project back to HVC through thalamic nucleus Uvaeformis ( Uva ) 18 , 19 , raising the further possibility that syllables , which are tightly linked to respiratory patterning 20 , may be timedby respiratoryoscillator circuits 9 , 21 . Withcurrent techniques , however , ithasbeen difficult totest ideasabout theoriginof dynamics that underlie the temporal control of song . Localizing temporal dynamics with temperature We set out to localize temporal dynamics within the song control system , taking advantage of the fact that the speed of brain processes is strongly temperature dependent 22 – 24 . The aim was to produce loca - lized mild heating or cooling 25 , 26 , rather than inactivation , for which cooling has also been used 27 . The basic logic of our experiments is as follows . If the circuitry in a particular brain area is involved in con - trolling song timing , then cooling that area should slow the song . Furthermore , if the neural control of song is organized with a dynam - ical hierarchy ( that is , different song timescales are controlled by biophysical dynamics in different brain areas ) , it should be possible to differentially alter the behavioural timescales by individually manipulating the temperature in these areas . Dynamics in HVC We started by bilaterally manipulating the temperature of nucleus HVC . We designed a device , based on the Peltier effect , that is capable of rapidly heating or cooling HVC in a spatially restricted manner ( Fig . 1a – c , Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Song timing was strongly affected by changes in HVC temperature . At colder temperatures , song motifs were produced more slowly than control songs ( Fig . 1d , Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . All birds ( n 5 10 ) showed a significant increase in motif duration during cooling ( ranging from 16 . 9 to 44 . 9 % ; Fig . 1e ) . Fractional change in motif duration ( dilation ) was found to vary approximately linearly with temperature in the range from 0 to 2 6 . 5 u C ( 0 to 1 A in terms of current ; Fig . 1f ) . The slope of this relation was used as a simple metric of temperature - dependent song dilation , which we refer to as stretch ( measured in per cent per degree Celsius ; see Supplementary Methods ) . The stretch metric in different birds ranged from 2 1 . 89 to 2 3 . 97 % u C 2 1 , with a mean of 2 2 . 83 6 0 . 22 % u C 2 1 . Changes in song speed during cooling were immediate and persisted for an hour or more ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . Notably , temperature changes in HVC had only a small effect on the acoustic structure of the song ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . 1 McGovern Institute for Brain Research , Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02139 , USA .

All rights reserved ToquantifywhetherHVCcoolingslowsthesongevenattheshortest timescale of subsyllabic structure , we used a standard dynamic time warping algorithm based on the correlation of sound features of the control song with the cooled song ( Supplementary Methods , Supplementary Fig . 5 ) , and also directly measured the duration of subsyllabic elements . The average dilation of subsyllabic structure for each song syllable was computed at each temperature condition ( 0 to 2 6 . 5 u C ; Fig . 2a ) , and the slope ( the stretch metric ) of the dilation as a function of temperature was computed for each syllable ( Fig . 2d ) . The mean stretch for subsyllabic structure was found to be 2 2 . 88 6 0 . 12 % u C 2 1 , which differs significantly from zero ( t - test , P , 10 2 6 ) . This observation suggests that biophysical dynamics in HVC are involved in controlling song timing on a fine timescale . We then considered the control of syllable onsets . In principle , respiratory circuits projecting to HVC ( for example through Uva ) could act as a ‘clock’ that autonomously controls the initiation of syllables , in which case cooling HVC should have little effect on syllable onsets . Alternatively , the onset of a syllable may be linked to the completion of the previous syllable , in which case the interval between onsets should increase during cooling , as the duration of each syllable increases . In fact , the intervals between syllable onsets were significantly dilated by an average of 2 3 . 05 6 0 . 11 % u C 2 1 ( t - test , P , 10 2 6 ; Fig . 2b , d ) . This is not consistent with a model in which syllable timing ( or the timing of singing - related respiration ) is autonomously controlled by circuit dynamics in respiratory circuits or any other area upstream or downstream of HVC . The stretch of syllable - onset intervals was significantly correlated with the stretch of the syllables within the intervals ( r 2 5 0 . 607 , slope of 0 . 92 6 0 . 16 ; Fig . 2e ) , and more weakly correlated with the stretch of other syllables ( r 2 5 0 . 47 ; see Supplementary Materials ) . In other words , for syllables that had a larger stretch than average , the onset interval to the following syllable also had a larger stretch than average . This is consistent with a model in which theonset of each syllable may be causally linked to , or triggered by , the end of the previous syllable . The silent gaps between syllables were also significantly dilated by HVC cooling ( 2 3 . 70 6 0 . 32 % u C 2 1 ; t - test , P , 10 2 12 , median of 2 3 . 29 % u C 2 1 ) , suggesting that biophysical dynamics in HVC are involved in the timing of gaps . The cooling - related stretch of gaps was slightly larger than that observed for syllables ( paired t - test , P , 0 . 05 , median gap stretch was 12 % larger than median syllable stretch ) . Similarly , the average stretch of a syllable - onset interval was slightly larger than the stretch of the syllable contained within that interval ( mean paired difference , 0 . 26 6 0 . 088 % u C 2 1 ; paired t - test , P , 0 . 001 , median interval stretch was 3 . 4 % larger than median syl - lable stretch ; Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . These observations imply that the circuit mechanisms involved in initiating song syllables may be different from those involved in generating structure within song 0 . 5 A 5 ºC 50 s Power supply Heat sink Peltier device nXIIts Syrinx D il a t i o n ( % ) D il a t i o n ( % ) Respiratoryareas − 1 A − 1 . 9 % − 10 − 5 0 5 − 10 − 5 0 5 0 20 40 0 20 40 − 10 − 5 5 0 . 5 mm 2 mm 4 mm 0 Current ( A ) ∆ T ( º C ) ∆ T ( ºC ) ∆ T ( ºC ) 100 ms Control ( artificiallystretched ) a d e f b c − 1 . 5 − 1 − 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 Figure 1 | Changesin HVC temperature affect song duration . a , The Peltier device and relevant parts of the song production pathway .

All rights reserved syllables , as has been suggested by measurements of the variability in timing of gaps and syllables in natural singing 8 , 9 . An analogous argument can be made for the timing of motif onsets ; if there is a ‘motif clock’ outside HVC that independently controls the intervals between motif onsets , then cooling HVC should have little effect on motif - onset intervals . In fact , motif - onset intervals were significantly dilated by an average of 2 3 . 19 6 0 . 24 % u C 2 1 ( t - test , n 5 7 , P , 10 2 5 ; Fig . 2c , d , f ) , which is not consistent with a model in which motif onsets are timed autono - mously by circuit dynamics outside HVC . Dynamics in RA Although the HVC cooling experiments strongly suggest the involve - ment of HVC in generating the fine temporal structure within sylla - bles , they do not rule out some involvement of other brain areas . In particular , circuit dynamics 14 , 16 , 17 and connectivity 28 , 29 within RA , as well as reciprocal connections from RA to HVC 30 , have been impli - cated in the generation of these short timescales . In general , these models would predict that song timing can be affected by manipulat - ing circuit dynamics in RA . Here we directly test this prediction by bilaterally cooling RA during singing . We use a Peltier device similar to that used for HVC , but with attached gold probes ( 330 - m m dia - meter ) that were implanted into RA to facilitate thermal conduction ( Fig . 3a , Supplementary Figs 7 , 8 ) . At a distance of 200 m m from the probe , the distance estimated to be the farthest extent of RA neurons , we observed a temperature drop of 10 u C at the maximum current used . We also found that the RA cooling device produced a slight temperature change in HVC of roughly 30 % of the temperature change in RA at each current level ( Fig . 3b ) . As expected , because of the residual effect of the RA cooling probe on HVC temperature , we observed a slight increase in motif duration at higher cooling currents ( n 5 4 ; Fig . 3c , Supplementary Fig . 9a ) . The effect of the residual HVC cooling on motif duration can be accurately predicted by the results of the HVC cooling experiments ( Fig . 1f ) and fully accounts for changes in motif duration produced by the RA probe ( Fig . 3d ) . Thus , after incorporating a correction for HVC temperature changes , we find no evidence that changes in RA temperature affect song motif duration ( P . 0 . 20 ; Fig . 3e ) or the timing of subsyllabic structure ( Fig . 3f ) , suggesting that dynamics in RA may not contribute significantly to song timing , at least by any mechanism that is sensitive to temperature changes in the range we were able to achieve here . The fact that RA cooling had so little effect on song structure led us to wonder whether our temperature manipulation had any effect on the neuronal properties in RA . In non - singing birds , RA neurons spontaneously generate tonic , regular spiking 14 , possibly associated with an intrinsic subthreshold membrane potential oscillation 31 . We measured the spiking frequency of single units in RA in an anaesthe - tized preparation while changing the temperature using the RA cool - ing device . Cooling produced a rapid , roughly linear decrease in RA neuron tonic spiking rate ( 19 cells from seven birds , slope of 0 . 85 Hz u C 2 1 ; Fig . 4a – c and Supplementary Fig . 9b ) that resulted in a near cessation of spontaneous spiking at the coldest temperatures ( D T 5 2 10 u C ) . Our observation that cooling RA by 10 u C produces a 2 . 5 - fold reduction in the intrinsic oscillation frequency of RA neu - rons , yet has no detectable effect on song structure or timing , implies that these oscillations are not likely to be a source of dynamics under - lying song production . In contrast , the incidence of high - frequency spontaneous bursts in RA ( Fig . 4d , top ) , known to be driven by synaptic input from HVC under anaesthesia and during sleep 32 , 33 , does not show a significant trend with temperature ( P . 0 . 6 ; Fig . 4d ) . The bursts exhibited only a slight cooling - related decrease in firing rate ( 5 . 6 Hz u C 2 1 ; Supplementary Fig . 9c ) . RA is thus capable of a robust response to burst input from HVC , even at temperatures low enough to substan - tially suppress tonic spiking .

All rights reserved The control of song timing by HVC : lateralization The HVC and RA cooling experiments highlight the centrality of HVC in controlling song timing . HVC is a bilateral structure , and it is natural to wonder how the two HVCs are coordinated during singing . Bilateral multi - unit recordings in HVC have revealed brief episodes of correlated activity across hemispheres that occur before the onset of each syllable ( and at some acoustic transitions within long complex syllables ) 34 , 35 , probably mediated by feedback pathways from RA to midbrain areas and bilaterally back to HVC 18 , 19 . Do these episodes reflect actual bilateral synchronization of the HVCs ? If the two HVCs were , hypothetically , synchronized only at the beginning of the motif , after which they operated independently , cooling HVC in only one hemisphere ( Fig . 5a ) should cause the two HVCs to become misaligned in time by more than a whole syllable by the end of the motif ( compare control to bilaterally cooled song ; Fig . 5c ) , causing song degradation . However , wefound that unilateral cooling of HVC did not produce song degradation , but resulted in slowed songs of normal acoustic structure ( n 5 4 ; Fig . 5b , c , Supplementary Fig . 10 ) , ruling out any model in which hemispheric synchronization occurs only at motif onsets . Do both HVCs contribute to song timing ? Given previous obser - vations of hemispheric dominance in songbirds 5 , 36 , it is conceivable that one HVC acts as a ‘master clock’ for song timing and that the other follows as a slave . In fact , in all birds ( n 5 4 ) we observed that cooling either HVC alone caused song slowing intermediate to that seen for bilateral cooling ( Fig . 5b , Supplementary Fig . 10 ) , ruling out the possibility that song timing is controlled by dynamics in a single hemisphere . One possible explanation for the observation of intermediate slow - ing is that the left HVC may control the timing of some parts of the song and the right HVC may control the timing of other parts of the song . In fact , we found that cooling the right HVC or left HVC pro - duced lessuniform stretching of the song in comparison with bilateral cooling , as predicted by this model ( bilateral non - uniformity s . d . of 0 . 67 % u C 2 1 , unilateral non - uniformity s . d . of 1 . 33 % u C 2 1 ; Fig . 5d – j ) . Thisinhomogeneityinstretchduringunilateralcoolingiscomparabletothemeanstretch ( , 1 . 2 % u C 2 1 ) , suggesting that a large fraction of song elements were not stretched by unilateral cooling ( bilateral cool - ing , 14 % not significantly stretched ; left only , 71 % ; right only , 43 % ) . Furthermore , some elements that were not stretched by right HVC cooling were strongly stretched by left HVC cooling , and vice versa ( Fig . 5d – h , Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Consistent with this , stretch dur - ing left cooling was significantly anticorrelated with stretch during right cooling ( P 5 0 . 026 ; Fig . 5k ; see Supplementary Methods ) . Thus , it appears that there may be some switching of the control of song timing between the two HVCs on the timescale of song syllables or long subsyllabic elements . A chain model of song dynamics The results of our HVC and RA cooling experiments do not support a view in which the dynamics underlying song timing are divided at different timescales between different brain areas . One possible model of dynamics in the song control system that is consistent with all of our observations is strongly anticipated by the singing - related firing patterns of HVC neurons that project to RA . These neurons burst extremely sparsely during singing , each generating a single brief ( , 6 - ms ) burst of spikes at a particular moment in every repetition of the song motif 37 . In addition , different HVC neurons burst at differ - ent times throughout the song . We have proposed that , as a popu - lation , these HVC neurons form domino - like chains of activity that control the timing of the song 38 . The HVC cooling experiments sug - gest that the dynamics underlying the sparse sequential activation of HVC neurons reside at least partly within HVC ; if the sparse HVC bursts were driven by an independent upstream sequence generating circuit , cooling HVC should not have affected the speed of the song . An interesting possibility is that such sequential chains of activity arise , in part , from a chain - like synaptic organization within HVC 39 – 43 . In this case , cooling HVC may simply increase the time it takes each neuron to burst following activity in a preceding neuron , thus introducing an accumulating delay that slows down the chain . Although the cooling results rule out models in which brain areas outside HVC independently or autonomously control song timing on any timescale , they do not exclude the involvement of other brain areas important for song production , in particular feedback projec - tions from RA , through the brainstem / midbrain and Uva back to HVC 19 , 21 . These projections could form an integral part of the con - nectivity that generates sequential bursts in HVC . Consider the time - scale on which this feedback might operate . In principle , every burst in HVC could be driven by fast , rapidly cycling feedback through this loop , rather than by intrinsic connections within HVC . Cooling any - where in this feedback loop , including RA , should introduce accu - mulating delays as well .

All rights reserved operate at thisrapidly cycling timescale , but lessfrequently during the song . Thus , one interesting possibility is that HVC may contain multiple independent chains 8 ( or modules ) , which may be associated with syllables or long subsyllabic elements 34 . These modules , each of which could run autonomously by virtue of circuit dynamics within HVC , may then be linked together in time by the feedback connections from RA through the thalamus and back to HVC ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . The feedback circuitry may act to detect the end of one syllable and rapidly and bilaterally initiate the next gap and syllable , thus simultaneously continuing the song sequence and resynchroniz - ing the two HVCs . In this case , cooling HVC would slow the pro - duction of a song syllable , because such production is generated by dynamics within HVC , and would also delay the onset of the next syllable , because this onset islinked to thetermination of the previous syllable by feedback circuitry . A module of chain - like activity in HVC may produce a song syl - lable as follows . During singing , RA neurons generate a complex but highly stereotyped sequence of spike bursts 14 , 44 . We have previously suggested that these RA bursts are driven rapidly and on a moment - to - moment basis by bursting inputs from HVC 37 , 38 . In this view , because RA burst patterns simply follow the timing set by HVC , we would expect RAcooling tohave a minimal effect on the timing of RA activity , whereas slowing the chain in HVC would necessarily slow the sequence of bursts in RA . Furthermore , if structures downstream of RA ( brainstem motor neurons and syringeal muscles ) respond rapidly to descending drive from RA , perhaps on the timescale of the fastest song modulations ( 10 – 20 ms ) 38 , we would expect that slowing the sequence of bursts in RA might slow the song yet have a minimal effect on song acoustic structure . Thus , a simple model of chain - like dynamics in HVC that drives a fast response in RA and downstream structures is consistent with the electrophysiological data and the HVC and RA cooling experiments . Here we have used local manipulation of brain temperature to identify components within the avian song system that control the timing of a complex behavioural sequence . This approach may be broadly useful in localizing specialized brain circuits that control the timing of other behaviours . We have also used temperature changes to test ideas about the contribution to song production of oscillatory dynamics in the song control pathway , an approach that should be generally applicable to localizing the biophysical origin of oscillatory and other forms of brain dynamics , and for studying their role in brain function . METHODS SUMMARY Subjects . Subjects were adult zebra finches ( . 120 days post - hatch ) obtained either from our colony or from an outside distributor ( Preferred Birds ) . All animal procedures were approved by the committee on animal care at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Cooling devices . We used a small ( 0 . 7 - g ) custom - built thermoelectric device based on the Peltier effect to cool HVC and RA . The HVC cooling device was constructed from two 1mm 3 2mm gold cooling elements that bilaterally con - tactedthesurfaceoftheduraoverlyingtheleftandrightHVCs . Thetemperature change in HVC was spatially restricted ( Fig . 1c ) , producinga maximal change of only 0 . 5 u C in RA , the nearest brain region known to be involved in song pro - ductioninthezebrafinch 5 , 45 . Thecurrentcouldbeswitchedtoflowbilaterallyor unilaterally through only the left or only the right cooling element . The RA cooling devices were equipped with a gold spike implanted into RA to facilitate heat transfer . RA electrophysiology . Acraniotomywas madeoverRAunder isofluraneanaes - thesia ( 1 . 5 % ) . The borders of RA were identified electrophysiologically and the coolingdeviceimplantedatthecentre . Singleneuronswereisolatedusingcarbon fibre electrodes ( Carbostar - 1 , Kation Scientific ) , with a signal - to - noise ratio of greater than 10 : 1 . Temperature measurements . Temperatures were measured using small ther - mocouples ( 5SRTC - TT - K - 40 - 36 , Omega ) . For HVC calibration , three thermo - coupleswere insertedinonehemisphere , under anaesthesia , atrespectivedepths of 0 . 5 , 2 . 0 and 4 . 0mm beneath the gold pad . In some birds , an additional probe was placed in the contralateral HVC ( at a depth of 0 . 5mm ) . Once inserted , the thermocouplesweresecuredwithdentalacrylicandthebirdwasplacedina cage and allowed to awaken .
