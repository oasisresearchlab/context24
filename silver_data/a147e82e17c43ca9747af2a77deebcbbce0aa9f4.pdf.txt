The mammalian heart has a very limited regenerative capacity and , hence , heals by scar formation 1 . Recent reports suggest that haematopoietic stem cells can transdifferentiate into unexpected phenotypes such as skeletal muscle 2 , 3 , hepatocytes 4 , epithelial cells 5 , neurons 6 , 7 , endothelial cells 8 and cardiomyocytes 8 , 9 , in response to tissue injury or placement in a new environment . Furthermore , transplanted human hearts contain myocytes derived from extra - cardiac progenitor cells 10 – 12 , which may have originated from bone marrow 8 , 13 – 15 . Although most studies suggest that transdifferentiation is extremely rare under physio - logical conditions , extensive regeneration of myocardial infarcts was reported recently after direct stem cell injection 9 , prompting several clinical trials 16 , 17 . Here , we used both cardiomyocyte - restricted and ubiquitously expressed reporter transgenes to track the fate of haematopoietic stem cells after 145 transplants into normal and injured adult mouse hearts . No transdifferentia - tion into cardiomyocytes was detectable when using these genetic techniques to follow cell fate , and stem - cell - engrafted hearts showed no overt increase in cardiomyocytes compared to sham - engrafted hearts . These results indicate that haematopoie - tic stem cells do not readily acquire a cardiac phenotype , and raise a cautionary note for clinical studies of infarct repair . A transgenic mouse line in which the cardiac - speciﬁc a - myosin heavy chain promoter drives expression of a nuclear - localized b - galactosidase reporter was used to monitor cardiomyogenic transdifferentiation events . These mice , designated as MHC – nLAC , have been used previously as donors for fetal cardiomyocyte transplantation 18 , where the robust nuclear b - galactosidase signal readily permitted detection of grafted cardiomyocytes in awild - type heart after 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl - b - D - galactoside ( X - gal ) staining ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Bone - marrow - derived haematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) were obtained from the MHC – nLAC mice by ﬁrst isolating unfractionated marrow cells , and then removing cells expressing differentiated haematopoietic lineage cell - surface mar - kers followed by ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) to isolate cells expressing c - kit . The resulting population of primitive ‘Lin 2 c - kit þ ’ cells , which are enriched in HSCs , was transplanted into the peri - infarct zone of adult congenic , non - transgenic reci - pients 5 h after coronary artery occlusion ( n ¼ 42 ) . Our occlusion protocol typically resulted in infarct sizes of 38 ^ 5 % of the left ventricle 19 . The Lin 2 c - kit þ stem cells were also transplanted into hearts injured by cauterization ( n ¼ 26 ) , where the volume of injured myocardium is considerably less 20 . Mice were killed ( 1 – 4 weeks after infarction ; Table 1 ) , and the hearts were ﬁxed and vibratome - sectioned at 300 m m from apex to base . The sections were then stained with X - gal and examined under a stereomicro - scope . Despite the ability of this assay to detect a single transplanted fetal cardiomyocyte 21 , no blue nuclei were detected in any of the hearts that received stem cell transplants ( Fig . 1c and Table 1 ) . Furthermore , immunostaining of these hearts revealed no ectopic expression of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain in the infarcts ( Fig . 1d ) . These observations suggest that the transplanted Lin 2 c - kit þ HSCs had not transdifferentiated into cardiomyocytes . In vitro co - culture experiments were performed to explore further the cardiogenic potential of the Lin 2 c - kit þ cells prepared from MHC – nLAC mice . Hanging - drop cultures were used to generate chimaeric embryoid bodies derived in part from non - transgenic mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells and in part from Lin 2 c - kit þ HSCs prepared from MHC – nLAC mice ( n ¼ 840 embryoid bodies ) . Chimaeric embryoid bodies were also generated by bulk mixing of the ES and HSCs ( n ¼ approximately 400 embryoid bodies ) . A similar approach was used previously to monitor transdifferentiation of adult - derived neuronal stem cells 22 . After 3 days of suspension culture , the embryoid bodies were transferred to adherent surfaces and allowed to grow for an additional 10 days , at which time widespread spontaneous con - tractile activity was present . The cultures were then ﬁxed and stained with X - gal . Out of the more than 1 , 000 attached chimaeric embryoid bodies screened , no blue nuclei were identiﬁed ( Fig . 1e ) . For each experiment , regions of the dish with contractile activity were microdissected with a Pasteur pipette , and DNA was prepared and subjected to polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ampliﬁcation ( Fig . 1e ) . The presence of the MHC – nLAC reporter gene was readily detected , indicating that MHC – nLAC HSCs were present but failed to give rise to overt cardiac transdifferentiation events after place - ment into a surrogate cardiomyogenic developmental ﬁeld . In other studies , co - cultures were performed using variable inputs of Lin 2 c - kit þ cells from MHC – nLAC mice and embryonic day ( E ) 15 fetal cardiomyocytes from non - transgenic mice . A similar approach was used to monitor transdifferentiation of adult endothelial progenitor cells 23 . The cultures were ﬁxed after 7 days and stained with X - gal . In ﬁve independently established co - cultures , no blue nuclei were observed . Modiﬁcation of the sorting protocol was used to assess the cardiomyogenic potential of other populations of bone - marrow - derived cells . Lin 2 c - kit þ Sca - 1 þ stem cells ( a population further enriched in multipotential primitive HSCs ) prepared from MHC – nLAC transgenic mice were transplanted into normal ( n ¼ 9 ) or cautery injured ( n ¼ 11 ) congenic , non - transgenic recipients . No blue nuclei were observed after whole - mount X - gal staining of vibratome sections prepared from these hearts ( Table 1 ) . Addition - ally , Lin 2 c - kit 2 Sca - 1 þ cells prepared from MHC – nLAC transgenic mice were transplanted into normal ( n ¼ 9 ) or cautery injured ( n ¼ 11 ) congenic , non - transgenic recipients . Once again , no blue nuclei were detected in the recipient hearts ( Table 1 ) . Collectively these data suggest that HSCs do not undergo cardiomyogenic differentiation after transplantation into normal or injured hearts . To rule out the possibility that the bacterial - derived b - galactosi - dase reporter gene might be subjected to excessive methylation when passed through non - cardiac cell lineages ( that is , through the bone marrow ) , thus resulting in its silencing , additional experi - ments were performed using HSCs from mice with cardiac - restricted expression of the Aequorea victoria enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein ( MHC – EGFP mice ) . In isolated cell prep - arations , 100 % of cardiac myocytes exhibit green ﬂuorescence 24 , and similar to the MHC – nLAC mice , the presence of even a single transplanted fetal cardiomyocyte was readily detected in control experiments . Using the same methodology as with MHC – nLAC donor cells , Lin 2 c - kit þ HSCs from MHC – EGFP mice were trans - planted at the peri - infarct zone of adult congenic , non - transgenic recipients . Of the ten recipient hearts assayed , none exhibited EGFP letters to nature NATURE | doi : 10 . 1038 / nature02446 | www . nature . com / nature 1 © 200 4 Nature PublishingGroup positivity ( Table 1 ) . Thus , two independent , cardiac - restricted reporter transgenes failed to demonstrate that Lin 2 c - kit þ stem cells undergo cardiomyogenic differentiation after transplantation into infarcted myocardium . To follow more readily the fate of the transplanted Lin 2 c - kit þ stem cells , as well as to test a reporter transgene that uses a constitutively active promoter , additional experiments were per - formed using transgenic mice in which EGFP was ubiquitously expressed from the chicken b - actin promoter ( b - Act – EGFP mice ) . Lin 2 c - kit þ HSCs derived from the b - Act – EGFP mice were trans - planted into the peri - infarct zone of 15 adult congenic , non - transgenic recipients . EGFP - expressing cells , identiﬁed either by intrinsic ﬂuorescence or by anti - GFP immunostaining , were abun - dant at 1 week after infarction ( Fig . 2a , middle panel ) but were much fewer in number at 2 weeks . The EGFP cells were small , round and did not co - localize with regions of sarcomeric actin staining in serial sections ( Fig . 2a , right panel ) . To test whether an immune reaction to EGFP 25 might have prevented detection of transdiffer - entiation , these experiments were repeated using non - transgenic nude mice as recipients of transgenic Lin 2 c - kit þ cells ( n ¼ 12 ) . Once again , the EGFP - expressing cells were small , round and did not co - localize with sarcomeric actin or myosin staining . Thus , even when a ubiquitously expressed transgene was used to follow cell lineage , no evidence for cardiomyogenic differentiation of HSCs was detected . Independent of transgenic analysis , the extensive regeneration of the infarct region reported previously by Orlic and colleagues 9 should be detectable in our studies by straightforward histological evaluation . Sections from mice receiving Lin 2 c - kit þ cells ( with either the MHC – nLAC or b - Act – EGFP transgenes ) were compared to sham - injected mice at 1 – 2 weeks after infarction . All sections revealed changes typical for 1 – 2 - week - old infarcts ( Figs 1d and 2a , right panel , b ) : there was a rim of surviving subendocardial myocardium , patchy amounts of surviving subepicardial myocar - dium and unresorbed necrotic myocardium that decreased in size from 1 – 2 weeks . The region surrounding the necrotic zone con - sisted of typical granulation tissue evolving towards immature scar tissue , and this granulation tissue had only background levels of myosin staining . The actin - or myosin - stained hearts with HSC transplants were indistinguishable from hearts with sham trans - plants , with no evidence of regenerating myocardium ( Table 1 ) . In addition to documenting a failure of the Lin 2 c - kit þ cells to undergo cardiomyogenic differentiation , these data also indicate that the presence of the transplanted HSCs does not result in the overt recruitment of endogenous cardiomyogenic stem cells . Finally , the ability of circulating , bone - marrow - derived cells to give rise to cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction was tested . Unfractionated bone marrow from b - Act – EGFP transgenic mice was transplanted into lethally irradiated , non - transgenic recipients . Mice were subjected to coronary artery ligation 2 months after engraftment , at which time their peripheral blood leukocytes consisted of . 90 % EGFP - expressing and thus donor - derived cells . Their hearts were studied from 1 week to 2 months after myocardial infarction , using double - label immunohistochemistry for EGFPand a - myosin heavychain . Cells with anti - EGFPand anti - cardiac a - myosin heavy chain immune reactivity were detected in the peri - infarct zone ( Fig . 2c ) , albeit only very infrequently ( on average only 2 – 4 cells per heart were detected ) . As an independent method to ensure that the EGFP signal truly resided in cardiomyo - cytes , hearts were enzymatically dissociated and studied by ﬂuores - cence microscopy . Once again , ﬂuorescent cardiomyocytes were observed at a similarly rare frequency in the dissociated cell Figure 1 Failure of HSCs from MHC – nLAC mice to activate cardiac reporter genes or express endogenous myosin heavy chain . a , b , Positive control vibratome sections of hearts engrafted with fetal MHC – nLAC cardiomyocytes showing a large ( a ) and small ( b ) graft .

The data presented here collectively suggest that direct injection of HSCs into the mouse heart does not result in de novo cardiomyo - genic events or tissue regeneration . No lineage - restricted reporter gene activity was observed after injection of MHC – nLAC and MHC – EGFP HSCs into normal or injured hearts , indicating that the cardiac a - myosin heavy chain promoter is not activated in the transplanted cells . This view is supported by the absence of co - localization of EGFP and myosin or actin by immunostaining . Indeed , not a single cardiomyogenic event was detected in the 145 HSC transplants that were analysed . Rather , the implanted cells remained morphologically consistent with haematopoietic cells and decreased in number from 1 – 2 weeks . Importantly , the presence of bone - marrow - derived cardiomyocytes after bone marrow trans - plantation and infarction ( Fig . 2c , d ) suggests that transdifferentia - tion and / or fusion events can be detected using the methods employed here . The very low level of cardiomyocyte repopulation after bone marrow transplantation in the current study is consistent with the work of Jackson et al . 8 , who estimated that 0 . 02 % of cardiomyocytes in infarcted hearts arose from bone marrow sources . These data are also in agreement with most of the analyses of chimaerism in transplanted human hearts 12 , including our own , where 0 . 04 % of cardiomyocytes originated from extra - cardiac sources 10 . These results contrast with the work of Orlic et al . , who reported extensive cardiac regeneration after direct injection of Lin 2 c - kit þ cells into infarcts 9 . The basis for this discrepancy is not clear , as considerable care was exercised to reproduce the methods for stem cell isolation and transplantation used by Orlic and colleagues ( see the Supplementary Information for a more detailed comparison of Table 1 Summary of intracardiac HSC transplantation data Donor cell genotype Haematopoietic stem cell used Heart injury Number of cells transplanted Graft age at death ( days ) Cardiomyogenic events per graft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Nonetheless there still could be subtle differ - ences in the protocols ; moreover , differences in trace components in the stem cell preparation might contribute to the differential out - comes . An alternative and perhaps more likely explanation for the discrepant results lies in the different assays used to detect cardio - myogenic differentiation . The study by Orlic and colleagues 9 relied exclusively on immune ﬂuorescence staining to track cell fate and to monitor cell differentiation after HSC transplantation . This approach requires the establishment of signal thresholds , above which cells are designated as positive for a given marker ( as , for example , GFP and myosin immune ﬂuorescence ) . Establishing thresholds in tissues with high levels of nonspeciﬁc autoﬂuores - cence , as is typically encountered in the infarcted heart , is by nature a subjective process . For this reason , the bulk of the experiments in the current study used transgenic markers of both lineage and phenotype , which have low background and hence are intrinsically less subjective than immunostaining . The absence of cardiomyocytes with activated reporter trans - genes after intracardiac injection of transgenic Lin 2 c - kit þ stem cells suggests that cell fusion does not occur after this form of HSC delivery . Fusion of bone marrow cells with host cardiomyocytes in uninjured hearts has been reported recently 14 . Fusion between cardiomyocytes and donor cells was also observed after systemic delivery of genetically labelled adult heart - derived stem cells 26 . It is possible that cell fusion might underlie the apparent transdiffer - entiation events attributed to circulating bone - marrow - derived stem cells 8 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 27 , as well as those observed after intracardiac injection of adult marrow - derived progenitors 28 . The absence of overt fusion events after intracardiac transplantation of HSCs in the current study may reﬂect differences in the mode of injury , the mode of delivery , and / or intrinsic properties of the stem cells used . The data presented here did not address the potential beneﬁcial effects of HSC injection on ventricular function after myocardial injury . Rather , the data indicate that Lin 2 c - kit þ progenitor cells isolated according to our methodologies fail to undergo overt cardiomyogenic differentiation when transplanted into normal or injured hearts . In this regard , it is possible that the functional beneﬁts observed by Orlic et al . 9 resulted from a beneﬁcial impact on left ventricular remodelling and / or angiogenesis , rather than myocardial regeneration . Indeed , it is apparent that cell transplan - tation can result in improved cardiac function in the absence of donor cell participation in a functional syncytium with the host heart ( reviewed in ref . 21 ) . Finally , it is worth noting that several clinical trials of bone marrow progenitor cells for cardiac repair have been initiated over the last 2 yr 16 , 17 . The failure of HSCs to contribute signiﬁcantly to formation of new cardiomyocytes in the present study may call into question the mechanistic underpinnings of such trials . A Methods Isolation of bone - marrow - derived HSCs Tibias , femurs and iliac crests were collected from MHC – nLAC , MHC – EGFP or b - Act – EGFP mice , crushed in PBS containing 0 . 1 % BSA and ﬁltered through a 40 - m m nylon mesh to obtain crude bone marrow . Crude marrow was then fractionated on Histopaque ( 1 . 083gml 2 1 , Sigma ) at 740 g for 25min to collect low - density marrow cells from the interface . Both mature and immature haematopoietic cells were depleted from low - density marrowcellsbypre - incubationwithlineage - speciﬁcratantibodiestomurine CD4 , CD8 , Gr - 1 , B220 and Mac - 1 ( Pharmingen ) and subsequently labelling with anti - rat IgG microbeads followed by magnetic cell sorting ( MACS , Miltenyi Biotech ) .

Cells ( Lin - depleted ) presentinthe ﬂow - through were pelleted by centrifugation at 435 g for 5min and incubated with c - kit ( conjugated withﬂuoresceinisothiocyanate or phycoerythrin , Pharmingen ) and / or Sca - 1 ( conjugated with phycoerythrin , Pharmingen ) antibodies and sorted by FACS for Lin 2 c - kit þ Sca - 1 þ , Lin 2 c - kit 2 Sca - 1 þ or Lin 2 c - kit þ cell types . Coronary artery ligation and intracardiac grafting This model was performed as detailed previously 19 , 29 . Brieﬂy , for studies involving stem cells from cardiac - restricted transgenic mice , recipient male and female mice were anaesthetized , supported on a ventilator , their left anterior descending coronary arteries ligated , and their chests closed aseptically . Five hours after ligation , mice were again anaesthetized , intubated , ventilated , and had their hearts exposed as above . The cell suspensionwasinjecteddirectlyintotheperi - infarctedareaoftheleftventricularfreewall , as indicated in Table 1 , using a 27 or 30 gauge needle . Sham - engrafted animals received comparable injections of serum - free medium . Closure and recovery were as above . All grafting experiments were done into histocompatible recipient mice such that no immune suppression was needed . Studies involving stem cells from b - Act – EGFP mice were performedasabove , exceptthattheHSCswereinjectedimmediatelyaftercoronaryligation . Histology Histological methods are detailed in the Supplementary Information . For detection of LacZreporteractivity , heartswereﬁxed , vibratomesectionedat300 m mfromapextobase , and whole - mount stained with X - gal substrate as described 18 . The sections were then carefully examined under a stereomicroscope for the presence of blue nuclei , a procedure capable of detecting a single positively stained nucleus in a heart 21 . The whole - mount sections were subsequently parafﬁn - embedded . Immunostaining for sarcomeric myosin heavy chain and sarcomeric actin were performed as previously described 10 , 30 . Chimaeric embryoid bodies HSCs ( Lin 2 c - kit þ ) wereisolatedfromMHC – nLACmousebonemarrowandmixedwith undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells at 1 : 1 , 1 : 2 and 1 : 8 ratios . Chimaeric embryoid bodies were formed as detailed in the Supplementary Information . Embryoid bodies were studied by X - gal staining and PCR analysis after 7 – 10d of differentiation , when areas of spontaneous beating activity were present . Bone marrow transplantation studies Our bone marrow transplant protocol is detailed in the Supplementary Information .

Myocardial infarction was performed 8 – 10 weeks post - transplant , when all animals showed . 90 % EGFP þ cells in peripheral blood . Mice were killed from 2 – 10 weeks after infarction and studied by immunostaining of tissue sections or microscopic analysis of enzymatically dispersed cells .
