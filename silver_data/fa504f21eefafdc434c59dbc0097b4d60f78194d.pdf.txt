Féréol 1 , 2 , 3 Received : 17 July 2020 / Accepted : 8 October 2020 / Published online : 6 November 2020 © Islamic Azad University 2020 Abstract In the context of tissue engineering , chitosan hydrogels are attractive biomaterials because they represent a family of natural polymers exhibiting several suitable features ( cytocompatibility , bioresorbability , wound healing , bacteriostatic and fungi - static properties , structural similarity with glycosaminoglycans ) , and tunable mechanical properties . Optimizing the design of these biomaterials requires fine knowledge of its physical characteristics prior to assessment of the cell – biomaterial inter - actions . In this work , using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , we report a characterization of mechanical and topographical properties at the submicron range of chitosan hydrogels , depending on physico - chemical parameters such as their polymer concentration ( 1 . 5 % , 2 . 5 % and 3 . 5 % ) , their degree of acetylation ( 4 % and 38 . 5 % ) , and the conditions of the gelation process . Well - known polyacrylamide gels were used to validate the methodology approach for the determination and analysis of elastic modulus ( i . e . , Young’s modulus ) distribution at the gel surface . We present elastic modulus distribution and topo - graphical and stiffness maps for different chitosan hydrogels . For each chitosan hydrogel formulation , AFM analyses reveal a specific asymmetric elastic modulus distribution that constitutes a useful hallmark for chitosan hydrogel characterization . Our results regarding the local mechanical properties and the topography of chitosan hydrogels initiate new possibilities for an interpretation of the behavior of cells in contact with such soft materials . Keywords Atomic force microscopy · Chitosan hydrogel gelation · Young’s modulus distribution Introduction Regenerative medicine aims at restoring the function of lost , damaged , or diseased tissue through its replacement or regeneration . The development and use of biomaterials to achieve these objectives is a founding paradigm of tissue engineering and a fast - growing research axis ( Kumar 2018 ; Meco and Lampe 2018 ; Rami et al . 2014 ) . Following this , it is well established that cell responses and functions are critically influenced by not only biological , but also topo - logical and biomechanical interactions between cells and biomaterials ( Glass et al . 2014 ; Zhou and Groth 2018 ) . Such interactions are partly regulated by cell adhesion sites in adherent cells , thus implying cell – material interactions at the subcellular level ( Fereol et al . 2009 ; Ladoux and Nicolas 2012 ; Skoog et al . 2018 ) . Among the various biomaterials used for tissue engi - neering , hydrogels are of interest because they are highly hydrated , ‘tissue - like’ materials , potentially providing a favorable medium for cell growth and differentiation .

Furthermore , their physical and biochemical properties , including stiffness , morphology , microstructure and composition , can be controlled ( Lee 2018 ; Li et al . 2012 ; Rami et al . 2014 ) . Chitosan hydrogels are currently used as medical device ( e . g . , the Novashield nasal stent marketed by Medtronic company ( Medtronic 2017 ) ) , but are also envisioned for water treatment , cell / tis - sue maturation , crop and food preservation ( Gutiérrez 2017 ; López - Velázquez et al . 2019 ; Mohammadzadeh Pakdel and Peighambardoust 2018 ; Perrard et al . 2016 ) . The choice of this natural polymer family is founded by a number of suita - ble properties ( biocompatibility , bioresorbability , bioactivity for tissue regeneration , haemostatic , bacteriostatic and fung - istatic properties ( Crini et al . 2007 ; Kim et al . 2008 ; Yang 2011 ) ) . Chitosans are linear polysaccharides consisting of N - acetyl d - glucosamine and d - glucosamine residues linked by a β ( 1 − > 4 ) glycosidic linkage . d - Glucosamine residues can be protonated at acidic pH , whereas N - acetyl glucosa - mine residues stay neutral . Polymers in the chitosan family differ by their degree of acetylation ( DA , i . e . , the fraction of N - acetyl glucosamine units ) , their molecular mass distribu - tions and , at a finer scale , the intramolecular repartition of glucosamine and N - acetyl glucosamine residues . Our recent studies suggested that chitosan hydrogels are promising can - didates as supporting material for various tissue engineering applications ( Aussel et al . 2017 ; Montembault et al . 2006 ) . Notably , the implantation of low - DA chitosan hydrogels in a fragmented form can be used as scaffolds for spinal cord injury and axon regeneration by preventing formation of a mature glial scar . This facilitates functional tissue regenera - tion and modulates the inflammatory response ( Chedly et al . 2017 ) . Regarding the latter point , our results are consistent with the study of Vasconcelos et al . ( 2013 ) which reported that subcutaneous implantation in mice of a chitosan 3D porous scaffold with DA 5 % induced an anti - inflammatory macrophage response ( M2 polarization ) , whereas chitosan scaffolds with DA 15 % favored a pro - inflammatory mac - rophagic phenotype ( M1 ) ( Vasconcelos et al . 2013 ) . Such phenotypic transitions of macrophages are believed to be involved in tissue repair ( Novak and Koh 2013 ) . However , the underlying cellular mechanisms by which the properties of chitosan hydrogels modulate the macrophagic response remain unclear . These include biomechanical , topographical , composition and processing parameters . In order to better understand these mechanisms , it is important to determine the mechanical , topographical and structural properties of chitosan hydrogels at a pertinent scale , i . e . , at the cellular scale , and more specifically at the cell adhesion site scale . Thus , the aim of this present study is to connect the mechanical and topographical properties of chitosan hydro - gels at sub - micron - range , depending on their polymer concentration C p ( % w / w ) , their DA , and their preparation route . For this , we used the atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . Indeed , AFM is recognized to be a suitable device to char - acterize the surface properties of gels ( Denisin and Pruitt 2016 ; Elosegui - Artola et al . 2014 ; Schillers et al . 2017 ) , although a correct characterization by AFM of soft materials with surface rugosity is a challenge ( Dokukin and Sokolov 2015 ; Notbohm et al . 2012 ; Piner et al . 1999 ) . In order to validate our experimental protocol and AFM data analysis performed with specifically designed software , a comparative study of the mechanical properties of refer - ence ( flat ) polyacrylamide gels with various elastic moduli , based on the work of Elosegui - Artola et al . ( 2014 ) , was car - ried out . Here , we present elastic modulus and surface topogra - phy maps at different depths in chitosan hydrogels and at 66 . 7 nm resolution ( within the local plane of the surface ) , with three different polymer concentrations C p ( 1 . 5 % , 2 . 5 % , 3 . 5 % ) , two different DAs ( 4 % , 38 . 5 % ) , and two gelation routes : the first preparation route involves the gelation of a chitosan solution in contact with gaseous ammonia ( Mon - tembault et al . 2005b ) ( ‘ammonia vapor route’ ) ; the second one results from the gelation of a chitosan solution with sodium hydroxide aqueous solution ( ‘NaOH solution route’ ) . Our analysis highlights that these physico - chemical param - eters modulate the mechanical properties at the local scale , as well as the multi - layered structure of the hydrogels . Such local AFM mechanical characterizations are compared to macroscopic shear rheological analyses . Materials and methods Polyacrylamide gel preparation Polyacrylamide gels were prepared according to the method previously described by Elosegui - Artola ( 2014 ) . Briefly , glass cover slips ( 30 mm diam . ) were activated to enhance gel adhesion , by immersion in a solution ( 25 mL ) of 3 - methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane ( 75 µL , Bind - Silane , Sigma ) , 10 % acetic acid aqueous solution ( 750 µL ) and qs 100 % ethanol during 3 min , before being washed three times with ethanol , and air - dried for 10 min . Thin sheets of polyacrylamide gel were prepared from differ - ent concentrations of acrylamide ( 5 . 5 % ; 7 . 52 % ; 12 % ) and bisacrylamide ( respectively , 0 . 03 % ; 0 . 16 % ; 0 . 15 % ) by addition of a solution of 0 . 5 % ammonium persulfate and 0 . 05 % tetramethyl ethylenediamine ( Sigma ) , to gener - ate gels of different elastic properties , i . e . , acrylamide 5 . 5 % + bisacrylamide 0 . 03 % ( noted Acr 5 . 5 % / bis 0 . 03 % ) , acrylamide 7 . 52 % + bisacrylamide 0 . 16 % ( Acr 7 . 52 % / bis 0 . 16 % ) and acrylamide 12 . 0 % + bisacrylamide 0 . 15 % ( Acr 12 . 0 % / bis 0 . 15 % ) ( Elosegui - Artola et al . 2014 ) . Twenty - five 189 Progress in Biomaterials ( 2020 ) 9 : 187 – 201 1 3 microliters of these mixtures were placed onto the surface of a circular activated glass coverslip and covered with cir - cular top coverslip ( 22 mm diam . ) previously treated with Repel - Silane ES , 2 % solution of dimethyldichlorosilane dissolved in octa methyl cyclooctasilane ( Sigma ) . After gel polymerization , the top coverslips were removed ; the gels were rinsed three times with phosphate buffer saline solution ( PBS , 1 × ) and were stored at 4 °C in PBS . During AFM experiments , polyacrylamide gels were immersed in PBS at room temperature . Chitosan hydrogel preparation Highly deacetylated chitosan produced from squid pen was purchased from Mahtani Chitosan ( batch type 114 , DA 4 % ) and was filtered in solution as described in a previous work ( Montembault et al . 2005b ) . A part of this polymer batch was then N - reacetylated , using acetic anhydride in hydro - alcoholic media ( Vachoud et al . 1997 ) . Briefly , anhydro - alcoholic chitosan solution was prepared at a concentration of 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) ( with a water / 1 , 2 - propanediol ratio of 1 / 1 [ v / v ] ) . Acetic anhydride was then diluted in 1 , 2 - propanediol , and this resulting acetylating mix was added dropwise to the chitosan solution . The amount of acetic anhydride added in the chitosan solution corresponded to the number of moles of amine sites to be reacetylated . After stirring for 3 h , the N - reacetylated chitosan was isolated by precipitation with aqueous ammonia , thoroughly washed with deionized water until neutral pH , and freeze - dried . The DA was analyzed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy , according to the method of Hirai ( 1991 ) . The DAs of the initial chitosan and the N - reacety - lated chitosan were 4 % and 38 . 5 % , respectively . The number average and weight average molar masses ( M n and M w ) of chitosans were determined by size exclusion chromatography coupled online with a differential refrac - tometer ( Wyatt Optilab T - rEx ) and a multi - angle laser light scattering detector ( Wyatt HELEOS ) , according to our previ - ous works ( Montembault et al . 2005b ) . The weight average molar masses were around 550 kg / mol for the two chitosans and the dispersity ratio M w / M n was close to 1 . 5 . The rea - cetylation step did not change significantly the degree of polymerization of the chitosan ( DP w ~ 3400 ) . Chitosan physical hydrogels were prepared using two different gelation routes . The first is the ammonia vapor route , which corresponds to a neutralization process per - formed by placing an aqueous chitosan solution in con - tact with ammonia vapors ( generated by 200 mL of a 1 M ammonia solution in the volume of a closed reactor of 5L ) for 15 h . Different gels were obtained by varying the DA ( 4 % , 38 . 5 % ) and polymer concentration C p ( 1 . 5 % , 2 . 5 % , 3 . 5 % w / w ) . A second gelation route consists of neutral - izing chitosan aqueous solutions with a sodium hydroxide solution ( 2 M for 2 h ) , using a chitosan with a DA 4 % at a concentration C p 2 . 5 % . All chitosan hydrogels were pre - pared following our published works ( Chedly et al . 2017 ; Fiamingo et al . 2016 ; Montembault et al . 2005a , b ) and then sterilized by autoclaving at 121 °C for 20 min . At the end of the hydrogel gelation process , in particu - lar for hydrogels issued from the ammonia vapor neutrali - zation route , a rigid and thin membrane covers the apical surface of the chitosan hydrogel ( Fiamingo et al . 2016 ; Sereni et al . 2017 ) . In order to characterize mechanically this apical membrane and the lateral surface , we manu - factured our chitosan hydrogels within 8 - mm - thick molds with a half circle shape with 35 mm diameter ( Fig . 1 ) using a Petri dish and a Teflon insert . During gelation with ammonia vapors , the lateral surface of the half disk was not in direct contact with the base , preventing formation of the thin and dense layer . In practice , our half - moon chitosan hydrogels were cut in smaller pieces ( ~ 1 . 5 × 1 . 5 × 1 . 5 mm ) using a scalpel . For AFM measurements , the sample is fixed on a glass cover - slip with a double - sided adhesive in such a way as to orient toward the top the unaltered hydrogel surface to be assessed by AFM . AFM experiments were performed in water at room temperature . AFM measurements We used two different AFM devices , i . e . , AFM ASYLUM MFP - 3D - BIO , provided by Inc . Oxford Instruments Asy - lum Research ( USA ) , and JPK bioafm NanoWizard ® 3 and 4 ( Germany ) . These different AFM benches were used to assess the force – distance curves with non - coated n - type sili - con cantilevers ( CSC38 ) provided by MikroMasch ® ( Sofia , Bulgaria ) . The tips used were pyramidal probes with 20° half angle aperture and 350 µm cantilever length . The same calibration procedure was systematically performed to cal - culate the nominal spring constant k , based on the thermal noise approach ( Hutter 1993 ) . The mean nominal spring constant was about 0 . 072 ± 0 . 026 N / m . Measurements on polyacrylamide gels were achieved considering a measuring point grid with 2 µm mesh over a 18 × 18 µm 2 surface in the gel center , i . e . , with grid mesh size in the same range as used by Elosegui - Artola ( 2014 ) . For each acrylamide / bisacrylamide sample , three different zones of measurement at the gel surface were arbitrarily cho - sen , thus leading to the analysis of 300 spectroscopy force curves per sample . Concerning chitosan hydrogel surfaces , AFM force spec - troscopy measurements , including apical and lateral sur - faces , were performed with a measurement point grid with 66 . 7 nm mesh size over an area of 1 × 1 µm 2 at the hydrogel surface . The analysis was carried out on 512 – 2560 force - spectroscopy curves per hydrogel sample area . 190 Progress in Biomaterials ( 2020 ) 9 : 187 – 201 1 3 According to Bilodeau ( 1992 ) , for quadrilateral pyra - mid probe , the force - indentation depth relation is given by the following Hertz - based equation : where F is the applied force , E the elastic modulus , 𝛼 the half angle aperture and 𝛿 the indentation depth ; 𝜗 is the Pois - son’s ratio assumed to be close to 0 . 4 for polyacrylamide gels according to values reported in the literature ( Alcaraz et al . 2003 ; Gross and Kress 2017 ; Hutter 1993 ) , and 0 . 5 for chitosan hydrogels . In addition , the contact point P c can be found according to the following equation : where h is the sensor position , d and k are the deflection and the spring constant of the cantilever , respectively ( figure SM1 in supplementary materials ) . Using ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we obtained the following equation : The elastic modulus E and the contact point P c are calculated by fitting the experimental curve F ( h ) with Eq . ( 3 ) ( figures SM2 and SM3 in supplementary materials ) . As we previously described in Féréol et al . ( 2017 ) , we have checked that the elastic modulus remained constant ( 1 ) F = 3 4 E ( 1 − 𝜗 2 ) 𝛿 2 tan ( 𝛼 ) ( 2 ) P c − h = d + 𝛿 = F k + 𝛿 ( 3 ) 3 4 E ( 1 − 𝜗 2 ) ( P c − h − F k ) 2 tan ( 𝛼 ) − F = 0 as indentation 𝛿 increased , to ensure that both polyacryla - mide gels , and chitosan hydrogels behave like an elastic material with a purely linear behavior . Due to the wide dispersion of elastic modulus values observed notably for chitosan hydrogels , we present our results with smoothed functions for elastic moduli distri - butions . Thus , a ‘nonparametric probability density func - tion’ ( NPPDF ) using a kernel density estimation based on a normal ( Gaussian ) function was determined with the MATLAB ® built - in function ( fitdist ( ) ) to fit the elastic mod - ulus occurrence distribution ( Mathworks 2020 ) . For each gel , i . e . , polyacrylamide gels and chitosan hydrogels , the bandwidth of kernel smoothing window or Kernel smooth - ing parameter Ker was set following this formula : where E max is the maximum value of the elastic modulus measured for each gel . Rheometry measurements Dynamic rheological measurements were taken on dif - ferent chitosan hydrogels following the same procedure as described in Fiamingo et al . ( 2016 ) . Briefly , rheologi - cal measurements were taken at room temperature using an ARES rheometer ( TA Instruments ) operating with a plate – plate geometry ( diameter 25 mm ) . The shear strain amplitude was monitored to ensure that the measurements were taken within the linear viscoelastic domain at a strain amplitude of 0 . 5 % , resulting in storage modulus ( G ′ ) and ( 4 ) Ker = E max ∕ 50 Fig . 1 a Image of chitosan hydrogel top view ( DA : 4 % , C p : 3 . 5 % ) , neutralized with ammonia vapor b sketch of the chitosan hydrogel half circle shape , red squares represent zones assessed by AFM . «a» is the assessed area located at the level of the thin layer formed at the first neutralized surface of the hydrogel , i . e . , apical surface , ‘b’ is the assessed area located between 0 . 5 and 2 mm from the surface on the lateral surface of the hydrogel 191 Progress in Biomaterials ( 2020 ) 9 : 187 – 201 1 3 loss modulus ( G ″ ) independent of the strain amplitude ( fig - ure SM4 in supplementary materials ) . Angular frequency sweep measurements were taken in the range from 100 rad / s down to 0 . 05 rad / s . G ′ is fairly constant with frequency in this range , as expected for gels , thus the values used here - after were determined in the low - angular frequency range . Rheometry measurements were repeated three times for each hydrogel type . Results Methodological validation with reference polyacrylamide gel In order to validate both our experimental approach to char - acterize soft materials , and the analysis of AFM results with our data analysis software , we prepared and studied three different polyacrylamide gels following the proto - col described by Elosegui - Artola et al . ( 2014 ) , i . e . , with following predicted elastic modulus values ( E EA m ± SD ) 1 . 99 ± 0 . 13 kPa ( Acr 5 . 5 % / Bis 0 . 03 % ) , 13 . 69 ± 2 . 84 kPa ( Acr 7 . 52 % / Bis 0 . 16 % ) and 29 . 01 ± 6 . 18 kPa ( Acr 12 . 0 % / Bis 0 . 15 % ) ( Elosegui - Artola et al . 2014 ) . Figure 2a – c presents the distributions of elastic modulus for these three condi - tions . The red curves represent the continuous estimations of distribution functions ( NPPDF ) that fit and smooth the histograms of elastic modulus values . For each polyacrylamide gel , we calculated the mean elastic modulus value noted E m , and the modal modulus value defined as the maximum of the distribution func - tion and noted − E . In all cases , we observed that the modal value − E is rather close to the mean value E m , indeed , the differences vary between − 0 . 4 and 11 . 3 % ( Table 1 ) . These results also compare well with the reference data obtained by Elosegui - Artola et al . ( Table 1 ) ( Elosegui - Artola et al . 2014 ) . The relative differences in the values of elastic mod - uli ( % ) for ( Acr 5 . 5 % / Bis 0 . 03 % ) , ( Acr 7 . 52 % / Bis 0 . 16 % ) and ( Acr 12 . 0 % / Bis 0 . 15 % ) are − 37 . 8 % , 0 . 2 % , and − 6 . 4 % , respectively ( Table 1 ) . For the softest gel , i . e . , ( Acr 5 . 5 % / Bis 0 . 03 % ) , the discrepancy found can be explained as described by Schillers et al . ( 2017 ) , invoking an uncertainty Fig . 2 Histograms of elastic modulus occurrence distributions ver - sus elastic modulus values for three polyacrylamide gels assessed by AFM varying concentration of acrylamide ( Acr ) and bis - acrylamide ( Bis ) .

Additional elements concerning the methodological validation are pro - vided in supplementary materials . In conclusion , our results are in good agreement with various data found in the literature ( Denisin and Pruitt 2016 ; Elosegui - Artola et al . 2014 ) , validating our experimental protocol , as well as our AFM data analysis . AFM study of Chitosan hydrogels We performed the AFM analysis of elastic modulus values at both the lateral surface , and the apical surface of the chi - tosan hydrogels for three different polymer concentrations ( C p = 1 . 5 % , 2 . 5 % , 3 . 5 % w / w ) , for two different DAs ( 4 % , 38 . 5 % ) , and for two different gelation routes ( ammonia vapor neutralization or sodium hydroxide solution neutralization ) ( Fiamingo et al . 2016 ) . The specific sample with a con - centration C p = 2 . 5 % and a DA of 4 % , gelled with gaseous ammonia was used in a previous work and showed remark - able regenerative properties in the form of a suspension of a fragmented ( micron - range ) hydrogel , inducing a robust axonal regeneration after implantation in a rat spinal cord lesion model ( Chedly et al . 2017 ) . In this work , we added two similar chitosan hydrogel samples by varying the con - centration , i . e . , 1 . 5 % and 3 . 5 % . It is expected that the topo - graphical , structural , and mechanical properties of chitosan hydrogel will be impacted by the chitosan concentration . Moreover , we also analyzed a sample with a higher DA of 38 . 5 % , investigated previously in the same study ( Chedly et al . 2017 ) . As previously reported increasing the DAs of chitosan strongly impacts the biological response of mac - rophages in vivo ( Chedly et al . 2017 ; Vasconcelos et al . 2013 ) . Finally , we used a comparable sample to examine the individual effect of the gelation method on the chitosan hydrogel mechanical properties , i . e . , gelation of the chitosan solution in contact with sodium hydroxide aqueous solution vs gelation in a closed reactor in presence of ammonia vapor . Due to the known differences ( Fiamingo et al . 2016 ) in structural and mechanical properties of chitosan hydrogels between the apical surface and the lateral surface ( represent - ative of bulk properties ) , we compared these two hydrogel regions by AFM . In the following , analyses and results are presented in order to distinguish between the bulk proper - ties , those assessed on the lateral surface , and those of the apical surface of chitosan hydrogels . Characterization of local mechanical properties on the lateral surface of chitosan hydrogels Figure 3 shows , for each chitosan hydrogel sample , the elas - tic modulus distribution histograms superimposed with the NPPDF distributions ( red lines ) , calculated as described previously . Whatever the tested sample , the elastic modu - lus distributions present a wide dispersion ( Fig . 3a – e ) with Fig . 3 a – e Histogram of elastic modulus and distribution functions for five chitosan hydrogels , varying their concentration C p , DA and route of gelation assessed by AFM on their lateral surface ( measure - ments performed at a depth between 0 . 5 and 2 mm from the surface ) . The red curve represents the nonparametric probability density func - tion ( NPPDF ) using a kernel density estimation to smooth the histo - grams . f Comparison of the normalized elastic modulus occurrence corresponding to these five hydrogels 193 Progress in Biomaterials ( 2020 ) 9 : 187 – 201 1 3 standard deviations close to the mean E m values ( Table 2 ) . Figure 3a – d also highlights an asymmetric distribution extended towards high modulus values , characterized by positive skewness values , s > 1 ( Table 2 ) , where the skew - ness is given by the following formula : where n is the number of data . Again , data processing provides the modal value − E and the mean value E m . As a result of asymmetric distribution functions , we can observe significant differences between E m and − E ( E m > − E ) ; the ratio ( E m − − E ) / − E varying between 25 and 75 % for the tested sample on the lateral surface except for the sample C p = 2 . 5 % / DA 38 . 5 % where the relative dis - crepancy between E m and − E is only 5 % , in agreement with a more symmetrical distribution , skewness = 1 . 3 ( Table 2 ) . As a result , chitosan hydrogels generally exhibit broad and asymmetric modulus distributions that could be associated with a submicron range heterogeneous structure at low DAs ( Popa - Nita et al . 2010 ) ( Fig . 3a – c and e ) ) . To go further , we assessed the macroscopic mechanical properties of all chi - tosan hydrogel samples with a plate – plate shear rheometer device ( Table 2 ) . The real part of the complex shear modu - lus G ′ is used to calculate the equivalent elastic modulus obtained with the rheometer device , E R ~ 3 G ’ and can be compared with E m and − E obtained with AFM ( Table 2 ) . The values of elastic modulus obtained by AFM ( E m and − E ) are generally higher than those obtained from rheology , except for the high DA ( 38 . 5 % ) sample . This could be related to the multi - layered structure of chitosan hydrogels , associated ( 5 ) s = 1 n ∑ ni = 1 � E i − E m � 3 �� 1 n ∑ ni = 1 � E i − E m � 3 � 3 with the gradual slowing down in the neutralization kinetics with diffusion depth ( Enache et al . 2018 ; Sereni et al . 2017 ) . At low DAs , the chitosan chain conformations in solution are strongly impacted by their charge density ; thus , a slow neutralization kinetics will yield a softer ( disentangled ) hydrogel . In - plane shear rheometry induces a series - type mechanical coupling of all layers with an apparent macro - scopic modulus ideally related to the moduli of all layers according to : where e i and G ′ i are the thickness and shear modulus of the i th layer and e = ∑ i e i is the width of the gel sample . From this ‘inverse rule of mixture’ or Reuss law ( Reuss 1929 ) , the impact of the softer layers should dominate the rheological response , resulting in lower E R values . Actually , since the hydrogels exhibit a multilayered morphology with a dense and rigid external apical layer on top of softer internal lay - ers , the AFM evaluation of the elastic modulus should yield a lower estimation of the elastic modulus of the dense mem - brane , since softer layers may also contribute to the indenta - tion . In spite of this lower estimation , the elastic modulus of the apical surface stays in order of magnitudes higher than the rheology estimation that is representative of softer internal layers . Influence of polymer concentration C p As expected , for the samples prepared through the ammonia route with a DA of 4 % , the values of − E and E m increase with the mass concen - tration C p . In the same way , we observe that the ratio E max − E also increases with C p , evidencing that the modulus distri - bution becomes more asymmetric at high C p ( Table 2 ) .

Such values are significantly higher than in homogeneous polyacryla - mide gels ( 𝛽 ~ 3 – 3 . 5 ) ( Abidine et al . 2015 ; Adibnia 2016 ; Oyen 2014 ) , which could result from the specific physical gel structure of chitosan hydrogels ( Popa - Nita et al . 2010 ) , implying the role of entanglements ( Popa - Nita et al . 2009 ; Sereni et al . 2017 ) , inherited from the polyelectrolyte chi - tosan solution in the mechanical properties of hydrogels . Increasing polymer concentration would thus result in an increase in multiple physical interaction sites and entrapped entanglements , leading to a ‘multiple’ physical network with various interaction types . Influence of the gelation route Figure 3f and columns 2 and 5 in Table 3 allow comparing the modulus distribution func - tions of hydrogel samples at the same polymer concentra - tion C p = 2 . 5 % and DA of 4 . 0 % , but with different gelation conditions ( NaOH solution vs ammonia vapor ) . We observe significantly higher values for the elastic moduli E m and − E resulting from the sodium hydroxide neu - tralization route , in comparison with the series of samples neutralized with ammonia vapor ( E m and − E are increased by a factor of 8 and 12 , respectively ) . Thus , the sodium hydrox - ide solution route yields hydrogels with a higher modulus , i . e . , more cohesive structure . The difference between hydro - gels obtained by one or the other gelation route is due to different gelation kinetics . Indeed , neutralization with ammonia vapors requires the formation of vapors and con - densation onto the chitosan solution surface , whereas neu - tralization with NaOH solution is followed by direct and fast diffusion through the formed hydrogel and the solution ( Enache et al . 2018 ) . Thus , neutralization with NaOH solu - tion is faster and could yield a more entangled hydrogel from the highly entangled polyelectrolyte chitosan parent solution ( Sereni et al . 2017 ) . Supplementary figures SM5 and SM6 display examples of the evolution of the gel width ( e ) during gelation of chitosan acetate solutions . Tables TSM2 and TSM3 show the comparative characterization of gelation kinetics in terms of reaction parameter 𝜉 = e √ t . Influence of the degree of acetylation DA The impact of the degree of acetylation on the modulus distributions can be observed comparing Fig . 3b and d obtained at the same polymer concentration C p = 2 . 5 % , using the same neutrali - zation conditions ( ammonia route ) , with chitosan of simi - lar molar masses , but at two different DAs , i . e . , 4 % and 38 . 5 % . An increase in the DA is related with a decrease in the modulus deduced from AFM spectroscopy . In solution , at a DA of 4 % , chitosan is a strong polyelectrolyte ( Popa - Nita et al . 2009 ; Schatz et al . 2003 ) with a high entangle - ment density and high hydrophilicity . At a DA of 38 . 5 % , the density of charge is lower , thus the entanglement den - sity also decreases , although the persistence length is partly preserved due to the steric contribution of acetyl groups ( Lamarque et al . 2005 ) . Consequently , in the neutralized state , low DA hydrogels will preserve a higher entanglement density , formed by interchain interactions from a highly entangled solution . Moreover , we previously showed that low DA chitosan in the neutralized state was in the most hydrophobic conditions ( Becerra et al . 2017 ) . Thus , low DA chitosan hydrogels could entrap a higher entanglement den - sity in a physical network formed with a higher density of hydrophobic junctions , resulting in a higher modulus for the hydrogels ( Table 2 and Fig . 3F ) . Chitosan hydrogel family identification by their mechanical properties In order to compare the characteristic mechani - cal behavior of chitosan hydrogels depending on three parameters , namely concentration , gelation route , and DA , we have reported the normalized nonparametric probability density function versus the normalized Young modulus dis - tribution for each condition ( Fig . 4 ) . This graph highlights that gelation route or DA values seem to impact the shape of the Young modulus distribu - tion , while parameter C p associated with low DAs results in Table 3 Analysis of Young’s modulus assessed by AFM at the apical surface of five chitosan hydrogels and associated methodological param - eters Apical surface Cp 1 . 5 % / DA 4 . 0 % Cp 2 . 5 % / DA 4 . 0 % Cp 3 . 5 % / DA 4 . 0 % Cp 2 . 5 % / DA 38 . 5 % Cp 2 . 5 % / DA 4 . 0 % ( NaOH ) AFM device Number of data 512 2560 1024 1280 512 Maximum measured value ( E max ) ( kPa ) 734 . 4 2 , 325 . 3 56 , 269 . 8 1 , 323 . 4 2 , 881 . 8 Mean value ( E am ) ( kPa ) 154 . 7 425 . 1 8 , 812 . 3 248 . 0 338 . 4 Standard deviation ( kPa ) 133 . 5 237 . 9 9 , 490 . 8 205 . 2 333 . 8 Peak ( modal ) value ( − E a ) ( kPa ) 57 . 9 398 . 7 1 , 747 . 9 87 . 2 174 . 2 Skewness 1 . 48 2 . 93 1 . 64 1 . 46 2 . 96 Kernel size ( kPa ) 14 . 7 46 . 5 1 , 125 . 4 26 . 5 57 . 6 195 Progress in Biomaterials ( 2020 ) 9 : 187 – 201 1 3 limited effect , and tends to preserve a similar shape of the normalized curves ( Fig . 4 ) . Young’s modulus and topography maps In order to com - plete the previous mechanical characterization and assess the characteristic sizes of the hydrogel microstructure , we report in Fig . 5 the Young modulus distribution maps over a 1 × 1 µm 2 surface together with the corresponding topo - graphical maps of each chitosan hydrogel . In Fig . 5a , d , g , j and m , the Young modulus distribution histograms calcu - lated from their corresponding maps are in agreement with the Young modulus NPPDF calculated from all samples of the same condition ( red curves ) as shown in Fig . 3 . The topography map of each sample is shown in Fig . 5b , e , h , k and n , and the Young modulus distribution maps are shown in Fig . 5c , f , i , l and o . Variations in height and elastic modu - lus maps do not appear to be correlated . Characterization of local mechanical properties on the apical surface of chitosan hydrogels The apical surface of hydrogel chitosan samples ( i . e . , the surfaces formed at first contact with the gaseous or liquid base ) was analyzed by AFM following the same method described above for the lateral surfaces . Thus , Fig . 6a – e shows , for each sample , the elastic modulus distribution his - tograms superimposed with the continuous estimation of the probability distribution functions ( NPPDF , red lines ) . As we already observed for the lateral surface , the elastic modulus distribution of chitosan hydrogels presents a wide dispersion ( Fig . 6a – e ) with standard deviation values close to the mean E a , m values and skewness values > 1 ( Table 3 ) . Again , all the samples studied on the apical surface show an asymmetric distribution extended toward high elastic modulus values of the histogram ( Fig . 6 ) . The elastic modulus corresponding to NPPDF peak values − E a is reported in Table 3 . Consider - ing low DA chitosan ( 4 % ) samples neutralized with ammo - nia vapor , the polymer concentration impacts the elastic modulus following a power law as observed for the lateral surface , although the absolute values are significantly higher at the apical surface ( Fig . 7a ) . When the DA increased from 4 % to 38 . 5 % , the elastic modulus − E a decreased by a factor of 4 . 6 ( Table 3 ) , while for the lateral surface analyses the factor was close to 3 . 3 . In order to compare apical and lateral surfaces , we have reported on the same graphs the normal - ized elastic modulus occurrence curves ( NPPDF ) from both surface type analyses in Fig . 8 . The apical surfaces exhibit higher elastic moduli , in agreement with the formation of a dense layer in contact with the base . Surprisingly , in the case of hydrogels neutralized with NaOH aqueous solutions , the apical surface modulus value is close to the value on the lateral surface , suggesting that the microstructure in the api - cal and lateral surfaces is similar , at least in the investigated depth range . Visually , or through an optical stereomicro - scope it was possible to observe a clear apical membrane after slow neutralization with ammonia vapor , whereas this membrane was more difficult to exhibit in fast neutraliza - tion conditions ( NaOH ) , possibly because the hard surface membrane could be much thicker and more diffuse ( in this case , the lateral surface investigation could still be located in the dense superficial membrane ) . In case of neutralization with ammonia vapor , we observe that the elastic modulus − E of the lateral surface and − E a of the apical surface follow a linear relation , i . e . , − E a ~ 36 − E Fig . 7b and Fig . 8a – d , whereas the NaOH route gelation yields − E close to − E a ( Fig . 8e ) . These results suggest that the gelation route and the gelation kinetics are key parameters in the formation of the layered organization of chitosan hydrogels , allowing to modulate the hydrogel homogeneity and induce mechanical gradients between the bulk and the surface layer . Discussion An atomic force spectroscopy at 66 . 7 nm resolution was carried out to examine the physical properties of chitosan hydrogels . The optimization of their mechanical properties requires the control of the gelation method , of the molecular parameters of chitosan ( ex : degree of acetylation ) , and of the formulation parameters of the initial chitosan solution ( ex : chitosan concentration ) . Our contribution is a local characterization approach , which allowed us to exhibit various , measurable structural heterogeneities in chitosan hydrogels at multiple length scales , as revealed by our normalized curves and modu - lus maps obtained with AFM . The differences observed in the modulus values obtained with AFM and rheology may arise from the multi - layered structure of chitosan hydrogels ( Sereni et al . 2017 ) , and the precise location of AFM analy - sis with respect to the hydrogel surface . In this regard , a high ratio of E m ∕ ( 3 G � ) can be interpreted as reflecting a high Fig . 4 Normalized nonparametric probability density functions ver - sus normalized young’s modulus distribution ( E ∕ − E ) of five chitosan hydrogels assessed by AFM on lateral surfaces 196 Progress in Biomaterials ( 2020 ) 9 : 187 – 201 1 3 197 Progress in Biomaterials ( 2020 ) 9 : 187 – 201 1 3 modulus gradient of hydrogels . Thus , AFM is clearly shown to be a unique technique able to reveal heterogeneities and gradients in the mechanical properties of chitosan hydrogels at the nanometer to micron scales , a characterization that cannot be assessed through the rheological behavior of mac - roscopic hydrogels . Specifically , at the micron - range area , the neutralization route impacts the breadth of the distribu - tion of elastic moduli : Ammonia vapor neutralization of low DA chitosan solutions yields hydrogels with a higher het - erogeneity parameter ( SD ∕ E m ) , in comparison with sodium hydroxide solution neutralization of gels at the same concen - trations . An increase in the DA strongly reduces such sub - micron scale heterogeneities , an indication that the observed modulus fluctuations for low DA hydrogels could be related to entanglement density fluctuations entrapped in the hydro - gels . Indeed , during neutralization , chitosan chains switch from an extended conformation in the polyelectrolyte state to a more compact and disentangled conformation in the neutralized state . Gel formation only occurs if an entangle - ment network can persist entrapped in the gel . Thus , at low DA , a high charge density in chitosan solutions could favor strong conformation changes and disentanglements during neutralization , whereas the conformation of chitosan of a higher acetylation degree chitosan would be less sensitive to the neutralization state , maintaining a persistence length due to the steric hindrances of acetyl moieties . Another important consequence of our nano - localized mechanical measurements is our ability to estimate the impact of the various parameters of chitosan formulations on the formation of different zones in the multi - layered hydrogels , at micron scale and / or higher length scales . Thus , we were able to characterize and compare the first - formed surface ( apical ) , and the bulk ( lateral surface ) of hydrogels . A stiffer membrane is formed at the apical surface , as was previously observed , although this was never quantified before ( Fiamingo et al . 2016 ; Sereni et al . 2017 ) . We have found a scaling relation relating the mechanical properties of the bulk versus apical layer for hydrogel neutralization with ammonia vapor , for all investigated concentrations and DAs . Our results also show that the polymer concentra - tion impacts the bulk and apical surface moduli of different hydrogel layers with a similar power law . Further , an increase in the acetylation degree was found to induce a decrease in the chitosan hydrogel elastic mod - uli . Although a higher DA results in a more hydrophobic polymer in acidic solutions ( Popa - Nita et al . 2009 ) , an opposite trend is expected in the neutralized state , where a low DA yields a more hydrophobic hydrogel ( Becerra et al . 2017 ) . Thus , in the neutralized state , a low DA chi - tosan should favor hydrophobic interactions , also entrapping a higher entanglement density , thus resulting in a higher modulus . Finally , our AFM - based mechanical characterization approach is pertinent to better understand hydrogel – cell interactions . Indeed , we have shown previously that alveo - lar macrophages are impacted , in terms of shape , spreading , height and cytoskeletal stiffness , by the mechanical proper - ties of the substrate with elastic modulus values close to 10 kPa , 40 kPa , 160 kPa up to nearly infinite rigidity ( Féréol et al . 2006 ) . This sensitivity is regulated by the formation of macrophage adhesion sites ( Fereol et al . 2009 ) . Concerning chitosan - based materials , several studies have shown that a change in DA is correlated with a change in the macrophage phenotype invading the hydrogel ( Chedly et al . 2017 ; Vas - concelos et al . 2013 ) . From our present results on chitosan hydrogel materials , changes in the DA are related to a change in mechanical properties in a range from 4 to 13 kPa , i . e . , the range of sensibility of macrophages to substrate mechanical properties ( Féréol et al . 2006 ; Sridharan et al . 2019 ) . This could at least partly explain the macrophage polarization mechanism in contact with chitosan hydrogels with differ - ent degrees of acetylation . In order to establish the specific impact of the mechanical properties of the substrate on mac - rophage polarization , further cellular studies are planned , varying the type of hydrogels , and the type of surface ( apical or lateral ) used for cell culture . Conclusion Atomic force spectroscopy is shown to be an ideal tool for the characterization of soft complex materials . In this work , we have developed a methodological approach and applied it to the characterization of multi - layered hydrogels obtained by neutralization of chitosan acetate aqueous solutions . At a sub - micron scale , we thus clearly demonstrate that the neu - tralization conditions ( with ammonia vapors or NaOH liquid solutions ) , the molecular parameters of chitosan ( degree of acetylation ) , and the processing parameters ( chitosan con - centration ) affect the hydrogel local mechanical properties . We have interpreted this by invoking the dynamic effects related to disentanglement time during neutralization and gelation kinetics . In addition , we characterized for the first time the elastic modulus of the thin membrane covering the apical surface of samples elaborated through ammonia route .
