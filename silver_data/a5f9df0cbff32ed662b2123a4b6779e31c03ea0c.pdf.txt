L E T T E R S High - speed depolymerization at actin ﬁlament ends jointly catalysed by Twinﬁlin and Srv2 / CAP Adam B . Johnston 1 , Agnieszka Collins 1 and Bruce L . Goode 1 , 2 Puriﬁed actin ﬁlaments depolymerize slowly , and cytosolic conditions strongly favour actin assembly over disassembly , which has left our understanding of how actin ﬁlaments are rapidly turned over in vivo incomplete 1 , 2 . One mechanism for driving ﬁlament disassembly is severing by factors such as Coﬁlin . However , even after severing , pointed - end depolymerization remains slow and unable to fully account for observed rates of actin ﬁlament turnover in vivo . Here we describe a mechanism by which Twinﬁlin and Cyclase - associated protein work in concert to accelerate depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments by 3 - fold and 17 - fold at their barbed and pointed ends , respectively . This mechanism occurs even under assembly conditions , allowing reconstitution and direct visualization of individual ﬁlaments undergoing tunable , accelerated treadmilling . Further , we use speciﬁc mutations to demonstrate that this activity is critical for Twinﬁlin function in vivo . These ﬁndings ﬁll a major gap in our knowledge of cellular disassembly mechanisms , and suggest that depolymerization and severing may be deployed separately or together to control the dynamics and architecture of distinct actin networks . Many cellular processes depend on the rapid remodelling and turnover of actin networks 1 , 2 . However , purified actin filaments disassemble very slowly , limited by a slow rate of ADP – actin subunit dissociation from pointed ends : 0 . 16 – 0 . 27s − 1 ( refs 3 , 4 ) . These turnover rates are at least 100 - fold slower than reported rates of filament turnover in vivo 5 , 6 , suggesting that cells have mechanisms thatpromotetherapiddisassemblyofactinfilaments . Onemechanism is through Cofilin - mediated severing 7 , aided by factors such as Aip1 and Coronin 8 . Here , we describe a distinct and complementary mechanism , wherein Twinfilin and Srv2 / CAP ( Cyclase - associated protein ) 9 , 10 work together to greatly accelerate shortening of filaments at their barbed and pointed ends . Twinfilin is a member of the ADF / Cofilin - homology ( ADF - H ) domain family and consists of two ADF - H domains , a ‘linker’ sequence , and a short ‘tail’ 9 , 11 ( Fig . 1a ) . Twinfilin localizes to many diﬀerent actin structures in vivo , including yeast cortical actin patches , Drosophila bristles , and mammalian lamellipodia , cell – cell contacts , filopodial tips , and stereocilia tips 11 – 17 . Genetic interactions between Twinfilin and Cofilin in yeast and flies have long suggested a role in actin disassembly 11 , 13 , yet the primary activities described for Twinfilin have been actin monomer sequestering 11 – 13 and suppression ofbarbed - endgrowth 18 , 19 . Therefore , weinvestigatedthepotentialrole of Twinfilin in promoting actin disassembly . In bulk assays , we tested the eﬀects of 1 µ M yeast Twinfilin ( Twf1 ) , which is its estimated cellular concentration in yeast 20 ( Fig . 1b ) . Twf1 had no eﬀect on the rate of pointed - end actin filament disassembly either alone ( Fig . 1c , purple curve ) or in the presence of Cofilin ( Supplementary Fig . 1A ) . Given its structural homology with Cofilin 19 , 21 , we considered whether Twf1 might work with Srv2 / CAP , which enhances Cofilin - mediated severing 22 , 23 . Indeed , in the combined presence of Twf1 and Srv2 ( full - length ) , we observed concentration - dependent stimulation of filament disassembly ( Fig . 1c , d ) . The ability of Srv2 to enhance Cofilin - mediated severing depends on its amino - terminal half ( N - Srv2 ; Fig . 1a ) , consisting of an oligomerization domain ( OD ) and a helical folded domain ( HFD ) that binds F - actin and Cofilin 22 – 24 . N - Srv2 was suﬃcient to stimulate actin disassembly with Twf1 ( Fig . 1e ) , and a mutation in the HFD ( srv2 - 91 ) that disrupts enhancement of Cofilin - mediated severing also abolished Twf1 - mediated disassembly , as did Srv2 (cid:49) OD , which disrupts formation of Srv2 hexameric shuriken structures 23 , 25 . Importantly , mouse homologues of Srv2 ( mCAP1 ) and Twinfilin ( mTwf1 ) also stimulated actin disassembly ( Fig . 1f ) , demonstrating functional conservation across distant species . Next , we directly visualized the eﬀects of Twf1 and Srv2 on individual actin filaments using total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy . Filaments were polymerized to a suﬃcient length ( > 10 µ m ) and sparsely tethered by incorporation of a low percentage of biotin – actin . Then , the actin monomer - containing solution was flowed out and replaced with proteins of interest ( with no actin 1 Department of Biology , Rosenstiel Basic Medical Science Research Center , Brandeis University , Waltham , Massachusetts 02454 , USA . 2 Correspondence should be addressed to B .

Barbed ends were identified by their faster polymerization kinetics before flow - in , enabling us to follow and separately measure eﬀects at each end of the filament . In control reactions , filaments depolymerized at rates of 0 . 34 subunits s − 1 at pointed ends , and 1 . 46 subunits s − 1 at barbed ends ( Fig . 1g , h ) , similar to reported rates 4 . Flowing in Cofilin ( Cof1 ) led to severing all along the lengths of filaments . In contrast , flowing in Twf1 and N - Srv2 induced rapid depolymerization of filaments from their ends , with no visible severing ( Fig . 1g and Supplementary Video 1 ) . Filaments shortened from their pointed ends at 5 . 68 subunits s − 1 , and at their barbed ends at 4 . 17 subunits s − 1 ( Fig . 1h ) . Thus , Twf1 and N - Srv2 accelerated depolymerization ∼ 17 - fold at pointed ends and ∼ 3 - fold at barbed ends compared with control reactions . Capping Protein restricted filament shortening to pointed ends ( Fig . 1i and Supplementary Video 2 ) . In the absence of Capping Protein , Twf1 alone induced barbed - end shortening at rates similar to Twf1 and N - Srv2 , but had no eﬀect on pointed ends . Thus , Twf1 is suﬃcient to accelerate barbed - end shortening , whereas Twf1 and N - Srv2 , or full - length Srv2 ( Supplementary Fig . 1B ) , are together required for accelerated pointed - end shortening . Twf1 and N - Srv2 could accelerate the disassembly of ADP – but not ADP + P i – F - actin , indicating that this activity is controlled by the nucleotide state of F - actin , as for Cofilin severing 26 ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 1C , D ) . Further , depolymerization was unaﬀected by the actin monomer - sequestering protein Vitamin - D - Binding Protein ( VDBP ; Fig . 1h ) , suggesting that the eﬀects of Twf1 on depolymerization are unrelated to its monomer - sequestering function . Cellular conditions strongly favour assembly over disassembly , as thecytosolcontainsaconcentrationofATP – actinmonomersordersof magnitude above the critical concentration for actin assembly 2 . Thus , a long - standing question has been how cells induce rapid disassembly of filaments under assembly - promoting conditions . To address this , we polymerized DY647 – actin ( magenta , Fig . 2b , c ) , and then flowed in 1 µ M Oregon green ( OG ) – actin monomers ( cyan ) and 5 µ M Profilin ( an actin monomer - binding protein that restricts growth to barbed ends ) , with or without Twf1 and N - Srv2 . In reactions lacking Twf1 and N - Srv2 , filaments elongated at their barbed ends ( cyan ) while the pre - assembled regions ( magenta ) persisted . In reactions containing Twf1 and N - Srv2 ( each at 0 . 5 or 1 µ M ) , filaments polymerized at their barbed ends concurrent with rapid depolymerization at their pointed ends ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Video 3 ) . These eﬀects were not observed in reactions containing either Twf1 or N - Srv2 alone ( Fig . 2b ) . Thus , the Twf1 – Srv2 activity has enabled us to reconstitute and directly observe non - steady - state treadmilling of individual actin filaments . We next varied conditions to tune the rate of treadmilling . Increasing the concentration of Twf1 and N - Srv2 while maintaining a fixed concentration of G - actin resulted in faster rates of pointed - end NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2015 1507 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Higher concentrations of Twf1 and N - Srv2 completely suppressed growth , and actually induced barbed - end depolymerization . However , elevating the concentration of G - actin restored barbed - end growth while still maintaining depolymerization eﬀects at the pointed ends ( Fig . 2e ) . Thus , we were able to separately tune the dynamics at each end of the filament . Further , a close examination of individual filaments under conditions that support a near - zero net barbed - end growth rate revealed alternating runs of polymerization and depolymerization ( Fig . 2f and Supplementary Video 4 ) . This was evident from the repeated appearance , and subsequent loss , of a small region of cyan - labelled polymer at the barbed end of an otherwise magenta filament . These observations suggest that processive associations of Twf1 and / or N - Srv2 at the barbed end underlies depolymerization runs , during which time growth at the barbed end is also blocked . Such activity could underlie the reported eﬀects of mouse Twinfilin blocking barbed - end growth in bulk assays 18 , 19 . We also examined whether the Twf1 – Srv2 depolymerization mechanism could work in concert with Cofilin - mediated severing , and observed that together they more rapidly disassemble filaments than either mechanism alone ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . 2A and Supplementary Video 5 ) . In these reactions , severing produced short fragments that were subsequently depolymerized rapidly from their pointed ends ( Supplementary Video 6 ) . These observations demonstrate that the two mechanisms are complementary , consistent with genetic interactions between Twinfilin and Cofilin 11 , 13 . The TIRF assays in which Twf1 and N - Srv2 accelerate depolymerization contain no monomeric actin ( for example , Fig . 1g – i ) , suggesting that one or both proteins directly interact with F - actin to enhance depolymerization . N - Srv2 binds F - actin 24 , and we found that Twf1 also binds F - actin in a concentration - dependent manner ( Fig . 3b ) . However , it was not possible to reach saturated F - actin binding in these assays because Twf1 also shifts actin to the supernatant fraction owing to its monomer - sequestering activity . Interestingly , F - actin binding was previously observed for Drosophila and mouse Twinfilin 13 , 19 , but may not have received attention because of the higher aﬃnity of Twinfilin for G - actin . Further analysis showed that at least three distinct domains in Twf1 are required for accelerated pointed - end depolymerization , includingitstwoADF - Hdomainsanditscarboxy - terminaltail ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . 2B , C ) . The C - terminal tail was suﬃcient to bind F - actin and contributed to the F - actin - binding aﬃnity of full - length Twf1 ( Fig . 3b , d ) . Further , Twf1 - 10 tail ( 305 – 322 ) alone was suﬃcient to bind F - actin , albeit with reduced aﬃnity compared with intact tail ( Fig . 3d ) , possibly explaining why Twf1 - 10 showed robust depolymerization activity ( Supplementary Fig . 2B , D ) , whereas Twf1 (cid:49) tail ( 1 – 304 ) lacked any activity . These observations show that accelerated depolymerization requires multiple actin - binding domains in Twf1 , including a previously unrecognized actin - binding site in its tail region . ElectronmicroscopyanalysisrevealedthatTwf1altersthestructure of actin filaments . Control filaments were long , smooth and straight . Decoration by Twf1 caused filaments to become highly ‘kinked’ or supercoiled ( Fig . 3e , f and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , with an appearance distinct from the ‘twist’ induced by Cofilin 27 ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . 1508 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2015 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

It was not possible to image filaments in the combined presence of N - Srv2 andTwf1 , becauseevenabriefincubationwiththetwoproteinscaused filaments to become extremely fragile and break on contact with the grid ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , and prolonged incubation resulted in complete disassembly . NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 17 | NUMBER 11 | NOVEMBER 2015 1509 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved L E T T E R S To test the importance of Twf1 - mediated depolymerization in vivo , we designed specific mutations in Twf1 that disrupt its activities with N - Srv2 . Cof1 - 9 is a mutant with normal severing activity , but is insensitive to enhancement by N - Srv2 ( refs 23 , 25 ) . Therefore , we introduced analogous mutations into the N - and C - terminal ADF - H domains of Twf1 , individually and combined , to produce Twf1 - 9N , Twf1 - 9C and Twf1 - 99 ( Fig . 4a ) . In plasmid shuﬄe assays , twf1 - 99 failed to rescue the synthetic lethality of twf1 ∆ cof1 - 22 , and twf1 - 9N and twf1 - 9C alleles only partially rescued growth ( Fig . 4b ) . These mutants were minimally impaired for actin monomer binding ( Fig . 4c ) ; in contrast , a control mutant ( Twf1 - 3 ) that targets the actin - binding surfaces on both ADF - H domains 20 exhibited greatly reduced monomer aﬃnity . Twf1 - 99 was severely defective in accelerating pointed - end depolymerization with N - Srv2 ( Fig . 4c ) . Although not anticipated , Twf1 - 99 was also defective in accelerating barbed - end depolymerization both in the presence and absence of N - Srv2 ( Fig . 4d ) . These results demonstrate that Twf1 cellular function depends on its accelerated depolymerization activity ; however , they do not allow us to distinguish between the importance of its depolymerization eﬀects at barbed versus pointed ends . To better understand the mechanism ( s ) underlying enhanced depolymerization , we varied the concentrations of Twf1 and N - Srv2 . With 500nM Twf1 and N - Srv2 , most filaments shortened rapidly at their barbed ends , while a few filaments shortened at a reduced rate comparable to control filaments ( Fig . 5a ) . However , the pointed ends of the exact same filaments shortened at a similar accelerated rate in every case ( Fig . 5b ) . Rates of pointed - end depolymerization also scaled with the concentration of Twf1 and N - Srv2 ( tight clustering in the distribution of rates at each condition ) , whereas rates of barbed - end depolymerization for the same filaments had a broader , almost bimodal distribution . These observations suggest that the accelerated depolymerization mechanism ( s ) may be distinct at barbed versus pointed ends , which is consistent with alternating runs of polymerization and depolymerization we observed at barbed ends in our treadmilling assays ( Fig . 2f ) . Using multi - wavelength single - molecule TIRF microscopy , we directly observed SNAP – 549 – Twf1 ( yellow ) molecules ( Supplementary Fig . 4A , B ) interacting with both the sides and barbed ends of OG – actin filaments ( magenta ) in the presence and absence of N - Srv2 ( Fig . 5c , d and Supplementary Fig . 4C , D ) . The average dwell time of SNAP – 549 – Twf1 molecules on barbed ends increased from 75s in the absence of N - Srv2 to 592s in the presence of N - Srv2 , but the dwell time was not enhanced by N - Srv2 - 91 ( Fig . 5e ) . Barbed - end association of SNAP – 549 – Twf1 persisted while filaments were depolymerizing , suggesting a processive attachment ( Fig . 5d and Supplementary Video 5 ) . The increased dwell time of Twf1 at barbed ends in the presence of N - Srv2 suggested the involvement of direct Twf1 – Srv2 interactions , which have been reported previously 28 , 29 . In supernatant depletion assays , GST – N - Srv2 depleted soluble Twf1 specifically in the presence of G - actin ( Fig . 5f and Supplementary Fig . 5A ) , similar to reported Cof1 – N - Srv2 interactions 25 . However , by electron microscopy we were able to visualize complexes formed by Twf1 and N - Srv2 even in the absence of G - actin . When incubated with Twf1 , the regularly shaped hexameric N - Srv2 structures gained 3 – 4 long protrusions , often with a ‘beaded’ appearance ( Fig . 5g and Supplementary Fig . 5B , C ) . The presence of G - actin gave protrusions a shorter and more rounded appearance ( Fig . 5g and Supplementary Fig . 5D ) . Together , these results suggest that Twf1 interacts directly with N - Srv2 , possibly facilitated by G - actin , to form a structure that more persistently associates with barbed ends during depolymerization compared with Twf1 alone . The average dwell time of SNAP – 549 – Twf1 molecules on the sides of filaments was not significantly aﬀected by N - Srv2 ( Fig . 5e ) . Further , SNAP – 549 – Twf1 was rarely seen at filament pointed ends . Together withourultrastructuraldata ( Fig . 3e , f ) , thesefindingssupportamodel in which Twf1 and N - Srv2 accelerate pointed - end depolymerization through their combined and possibly independent interactions with filament sides and conformational eﬀects on F - actin 24 . In sum , our findings identify the long sought - after actin end - depolymerase . Although Twinfilin and Cofilin are members of the same ADF - H domain superfamily 9 , they clearly have mechanistically distinct roles in promoting actin disassembly . Further , our data show that when severing is partially impaired in vivo , the depolymerization activity of Twf1 becomes vital . Enhanced severing by Cofilin , Aip1 and Coronin produces capped F - actin fragments ∼ 20 subunits long 8 , 30 , but these fragments will require over a minute to depolymerize on the basis of a 0 . 27 subunits s − 1 dissociation rate at pointed ends 3 . Twf1 and Srv2 can increase the depolymerization rate by 17 - fold , such that the same fragments would depolymerize in 4 – 5s . Therefore , mechanisms of enhanced severing combined with accelerated depolymerization together would yield extremely high rates of actin turnover , such as those observed at the leading edge 5 . In addition , the depolymerization mechanisms we have described may play an important role in controlling the length and turnover of actin arrays comprised of longer filaments , such as filopodia and stereocilia , where Twinfilin localizes 12 , 16 , 17 .

In all experiments , 24 × 60mm coverslips ( Fisher Scientific ) were first cleaned by sonication in detergent for 60min , followed by successive sonication in 1M KOH and 1M HCl for 20min each , and then sonication in ethanol for at least 60min . Coverslips were then washed extensively with ddH 2 O , dried in a N 2 stream , layered with 200 µ l of 80 % ethanol pH2 . 0 , 2mgml − 1 methoxy - poly ( ethylene glycol ) - silane and 2 µ gml − 1 biotin - poly ( ethylene glycol ) - silane ( Laysan Bio ) , and incubated for 16h at 70 ◦ C . FlowcellswereassembledbyrinsingPEG - coatedcoverslipsextensivelywithddH 2 O , then attaching them to a flow chamber ( Ibidi ) with double - sided tape ( 2 . 5cm × 2mm × 120 µ m ) and epoxy resin . OG - labelled actin was prepared as described previously 4 , and DY647 - labelled actin was prepared equivalently . For flow - in experiments , flow cells were incubated for 2min with HBSA ( HEK buﬀerwith1 % BSA ) with0 . 1mgml − 1 streptavidin . Flowcellswerethenequilibrated with 1 × TIRF buﬀer ( 10mM imidazole , 50mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , 0 . 2mM ATP , 10mM DTT , 15mM glucose , 20 µ gml − 1 catalase , 100 µ gml − 1 glucose oxidase , and 0 . 5 % methylcellulose ( 4000 cP ) , pH7 . 4 ) . Reactions were initiated by rapidly diluting actin monomers ( 1 µ M final , 10 % OG - or 5 % DY647 - labelled , 0 . 5 % biotinylated ) into 1 × TIRF buﬀer and transferring the mixture to a flow chamber . After a few minutes of actin polymerization , the reaction mixture was replaced with TIRF buﬀer lacking actin monomers , with or without Twf1 and / or Srv2 and / or Capping Protein . For TIRF experiments performed under assembly - promoting conditions , the flow - in mixture also included actin monomers and / or Profilin . In experiments addressing the actin nucleotide preference of Cof1 or Twf1 and Srv2 , 35mM free P i was included in the reactions . On the basis of rate constants for ATP hydrolysis and P i release 38 , 39 , pre - assembled filaments in reactions where P i is not included should consistpredominantlyofADP - boundactinsubunitsbythetimeofflow - in ; however , inclusion of free P i drives filaments into the ADP + P i - bound state 26 . Flow - through was achieved using a syringe - pump ( Harvard Apparatus ) . Time - lapse TIRF microscopy was performed using a Nikon - Ti200 inverted microscope equipped with a 150mW Ar - Laser ( Melles Griot ) , a TIRF objective with a N . A . of 1 . 49 ( Nikon Instruments ) , and an EMCCD camera ( Andor Ixon ) . During measurements , optimalfocuswasmaintainedusingthePerfectFocusSystem ( Nikon Instruments ) . Images were captured every 5s . The pixel size corresponded to 0 . 27 µ m . Filament depolymerization rates were determined by tracing filaments in ImageJ ( http : / / rsbweb . nih . gov / ij ) and measuring the change in length of individual filaments for 15 – 20min after flow - in , or until filaments disappeared . Diﬀerences in fluorescence intensity along the length of the filament , or the boundary between OG - and DY647 - labelled segments of filaments , were used as fiduciary markers to distinguish between barbed - and pointed - end depolymerization . Quantification of total filament levels in TIRF reactions was carried out by first subtracting backgroundandconvertingtheimagetobinarypixelsinImageJ , andthenmeasuring total fluorescence intensity in the field of view over time . Curves shown in Figs 2a and 3a and Supplementary Fig . 1C are averages of the measurements for two fields of view from the same reaction , with each field of view being about 25 times larger than the accompanying time - lapse images . For single - molecule bleaching experiments , 0 . 1 nM SNAP – 549 – biotin – Twf1 in TIRF buﬀer without glucose oxidase and catalase was transferred into a flow cell as above , and immobile spots ( anchored through streptavidin to the biotin – PEG on the slide surface ) were subjected to continuous illumination and imaged every 0 . 1s . Fluorescence intensities of spots were obtained by measuring the integrated fluorescence signal from a small region of interest in ImageJ . Then , stepwise reductions in the integrated fluorescence intensity time records of individual spots were subjectively identified and counted . Seventy - five spots in each of two independent reactions were measured . For determination of protein oligomeric state by single - molecule fluorescence , the measured distribution of fluorescence intensity or distribution of numbers of photobleaching steps was compared to the probability distribution p ( i ) of the number of fluorescent subunits i predicted for a protein oligomer consisting of NATURE CELL BIOLOGY © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

( n − 1 ) ! (cid:19) s i ( 1 − s ) n − i This approach is expected to be valid because SNAP - tagged protein monomers each have only a single site for reaction with the benzylguanine - dye adduct . Consistent with this , measured values of s were always < 1 . Electron microscopy . Actin ( 20 µ M ) waspolymerizedfor1hat25 ◦ C , thendiluted to 2 µ M in F - buﬀer ( 50mM KCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2mM EGTA , 1mM DTT , 5mM Tris , pH0 . 8 ) and incubated at 25 ◦ C for 3min with Twf1 , N - Srv2 , or Twf1 and N - Srv2 ( 0 . 5 µ M each ) . Samples were diluted twofold in F - buﬀer and adsorbed to glow - discharged Formvar / carbon - coated 200 mesh copper grids for 15 – 20s , blotted to remove excess solution , negatively stained with 1 % ( w / v ) uranyl acetate for 1min , blotted again , and allowed to air - dry . For imaging individual proteins in the absence of actin , 0 . 5 µ M N - Srv2 ± 0 . 5 µ M Twf1 was applied to grids and negative stained as above . Images were captured using an FEI Morgani 268 transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 80kV and magnifications of 14 , 000 , 18 , 000 or 22 , 000 . Images are representative from experiments repeated 2 – 3 times . F - actin co - sedimentation assays . Diﬀerent concentrations ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 µ M ) of preformed F - actin were incubated with Twf1 , Twf1 (cid:49) tail , MBP – Twf1 tail , or MBP – Twf1 - 10tailfor10minatroomtemperature . Reactionswerecentrifugedat350 , 000 g for 30min at 20 ◦ C . Supernatant and pellet fractions were analysed on gels by Coomassie staining and quantified by scanning densitometry . Each Twf1 construct was processed in parallel reactions lacking F - actin , and the fraction of Twf1 that pelleted nonspecifically was subtracted from the analysis . For MBP – Twf1 tail and MBP – Twf1 - 10 tail , owing to their molecular weights being very close to that of actin , the relative abundance of protein in the supernatant and pellet fractions was determinedbyquantitativewesternblotusinganti - MBPantibody ( NEB ; E8038S ) at 1 : 10 , 000 dilution . Fluorescence anisotropy . OG – ATP – G - actin ( 100nM ) was mixed with various concentrations of wild - type and mutant Twf1 in G - buﬀer ( 5mM Tris pH7 . 5 , 0 . 1mMCaCl 2 , 0 . 5mMDTTand0 . 2mMATP ) , andincubatedatroomtemperature for 15min . Then anisotropy was determined by measuring polarized emission intensities at 530nm when excited at 488nm ( mean intensity over a 2min time period ) . Anisotropy values were normalized against control reactions lacking Twf1 . Supernatant depletion assays . GST – N - Srv2 and GST alone ( 20 µ M final ) were bound to glutathione – agarose beads and mixed for 20min with 2 µ M Twf1 and / or 2 µ MADP – G - actin .

A twf1 ∆ cof1 - 22 mutant yeast strain carrying a URA3 - marked wild - type TWF1 plasmid ( pRS316 - Twf1 ) to maintain viability was transformed with the following HIS3 - marked plasmids : pRS313 ( empty vector ) , pRS313 - Twf1 , pRS313 - Twf1 - 9N , pRS313 - Twf1 - 9C , and pRS313 - Twf1 - 99 . Cells were grown to saturation in His - media , plated as serial dilutions on Ura - or 5 - fluoroorotic acid ( 5 - FOA ) media , and grown at 25 ◦ C for 3 days . Quantitative immunoblotting to determine cellular levels of proteins . Whole - cell extracts ( WCEs ) were prepared from a wild - type yeast strain ( BGY12 ) grown in rich medium ( YPD ) to an attenuance of 1 at 600nm as described . Total protein concentration in WCEs was determined using a Coomassie spot assay and a BSA standard curve . For each protein quantified ( actin , Srv2 and Twf1 ) , three diﬀerent amounts of WCE were immunoblotted in parallel with known quantities of the purified proteins . Antibodies raised in hens ( Aves ) against yeast actin and Srv2 , and in rabbits against yeast Twf1 ( ref . 20 ) , were used at dilutions of 1 : 20 , 000 , 1 : 7 , 000 and 1 : 1 , 000 , respectively . HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies , anti - chicken ( Aves ) or anti - rabbit ( GE Healthcare ) , were used at 1 : 10 , 000 . Signals were detected by chemiluminescence and quantified by densitometry . Bands with intensitiesinthelinearrangeofthestandardcurvewereusedtocalculatenanogramsofthespecificproteinpermicrogramoftotalcellularprotein . Molar concentrations of these proteins in WCEs were calculated from their cellular abundance ( ng µ g − 1 total protein ) , molecular weights , and the concentration of total protein in the extract ( 4 . 2 µ g µ l − 1 ) . These values were used to calculate cellular concentrations by measuring cell densities ( using a haemocytometer ) in the samples used to make WCEs . On the basis of electron micrographs of yeast cells , we estimated that over halfofthecellvolumeisoccupiedbynon - cytosoliccompartments ( forexample , cell wall , vacuole , mitochondria , plasmamembrane , endoplasmicreticulum , andGolgi ) . Thus , we make a conservative estimate that the cytosolic concentrations of these proteins are twofold higher than their calculated cellular concentrations . Statisticalanalysis .
