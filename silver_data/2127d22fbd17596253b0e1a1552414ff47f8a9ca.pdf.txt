Here we describe a novel phosphorylation mechanism that regulates the hyaluronan receptor CD44 . In resting cells , CD44 is constitutively phosphorylated at a single serine residue , Ser325 . After protein kinase C is activated , a switch in phosphorylation results in CD44 being phosphorylated solely at an alternative residue , Ser291 . Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) monitored by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy ( FLIM ) and chemotaxis assays we show that phosphorylation of Ser291 modulates the interaction between CD44 and the cytoskeletal linker protein ezrin in vivo , and that this phosphorylation is critical for CD44 - dependent directional cell motility . T he ability of mammalian cells to detect and respond to changes in their environment is a vital component of co - ordi - nated cell migration . For this to occur , transmembrane recep - tors transduce cues such as changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix , which result in morphological changes elicit - ed by the actin cytoskeleton . In the majority of cases , however , interaction of the actin cytoskeleton with these receptors is not direct but is mediated by linker or adaptor proteins present in membrane – cytoskeletal junctional complexes . Many of the compo - nents of these complexes have now been identified and , in some cases , their interaction domains have been mapped . The current challenge is to understand how these complexes are assembled and disassembled in a controlled manner . This study focuses on the transmembrane receptor CD44 and the ERM ( ezrin , radixin , moesin ) proteins . CD44 is the major cell - surface hyaluronan receptor expressed on a diverse variety of cell types . Much of the interest in this receptor stems from the demon - stration that , in addition to normal physiological cell - adhesion and cell - migration functions , CD44 has been implicated as a key com - ponent of tumour progression and inflammatory disease . Structurally , CD44 is highly heterogeneous , brought about by both glycosylation and alternative splicing of the extracellular domain to generate a family of cell - surface glycoproteins . But both the trans - membrane and cytoplasmic domains are identical in all of the vari - ant CD44 isoforms and are highly conserved between species 1 – 3 . In recent years , members of the ERM family have been subject to scrutiny because they can act as linker proteins between the cyto - plasmic domains of transmembrane receptors and the actin - based cortical cytoskeleton 4 – 6 . Functionally , ERM proteins are controlled by phosphorylation and phospholipid binding , which determine the accessibility of their transmembrane - protein - binding , actin - binding and self - association sites 7 – 10 . Furthermore , ERM proteins have been implicated as regulators of both the Rho family proteins and PI3 kinase 11 – 14 , which undoubtedly underlies their function in mediating cell - migration events 15 – 18 . From these types of studies , a clearer picture is emerging of how the regulated activation of ERM proteins can control cell morphology , motility and intracellular sig - nalling events . However , although the binding sites for ERM and ERM - related proteins ( such as merlin ) in the transmembrane pro - teins with which they associate have been identified 19 – 21 ( Fig . 1a ) , little is known about whether these receptors regulate their associa - tion with ERM proteins , how such regulation might be mediated , and the functional consequences of receptor – ERM complex forma - tion . These issues are addressed in this manuscript , in which we show that activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) triggers a transition from phosphorylation of CD44 predominantly at Ser325 to Ser291 , which facilitates disassociation of CD44 – ezrin complexes and con - trols directional cellular motility . Results Generation of monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) specific to CD44 phosphorylated at Ser325 . Previous in vivo 32 P - orthophosphate labelling and mutational analyses have demonstrated that , in rest - ing cells , CD44 is phosphorylated to high stoichiometry on a single serine residue , Ser325 ( refs 22 , 23 ) and that phosphorylation at this site is required for CD44 - dependent cell migration on hyaluronan substrate 22 , 24 . To gain further insight into how phosphorylation reg - ulates CD44 function , we generated mAbs that specifically recog - nize Ser325 - phosphorylated CD44 . For this purpose , mice were immunized with a keyhole limpet haemocyanin ( KLH ) - conjugated peptide comprising Leu318 – His330 of the CD44 cytoplasmic domain and containing a phosphoserine residue incorporated at the 325 position ( SP CD44 phosphopeptide ; Fig . 1a ) . From 818 hybridomas screened , two mAbs , 14E4 and 18E2 , showed strong reactivity against the SP CD44 phosphopeptide but had minimal reactivity against the non - phosphorylated ( NP ) CD44 peptide or the two control SM2 and SM3 phosphopeptides ( Fig . 1b ) .

CD44 was immunoprecipitated with mAb E1 / 2 , which recognizes an extracel - lular - domain epitope , and treated with or without alkaline phos - phatase . Autoradiography demonstrated that WT CD44 is heavily phosphorylated and that all of this phosphate is removed by phos - phatase treatment ( Fig . 1c ) . Immunoblotting of parallel unlabelled samples with a pan CD44 mAb , IM7 , confirmed that phosphatase treatment did not result in loss of CD44 expression . mAbs 14E4 and 18E2 showed reactivity to untreated WT CD44 but not to phosphatase - treated WT CD44 . This reactivity of mAbs 14E4 and 18E2 is not restricted to transfected CD44 as both mAbs were effec - tive in immunoblotting endogenous CD44 from human fibroblast lysates ( Fig . 1d ) , and this reactivity could be competed by preincu - bation with the SP CD44 phosphopeptide but not the non - phos - phorylated NP CD44 peptide . No significant differences in the reactivities of mAbs 14E4 or 18E2 were observed in any experi - ments . Together these data demonstrate that mAb 14E4 and mAb 18E2 specifically recognize the Ser325 - phosphorylated form of CD44 . PKC regulates CD44 phosphorylation . Previous studies on CD44 as a potential protein kinase C ( PKC ) substrate have generated contra - dictory data . Kalormiris and Bourguignon 25 reported that purified CD44 could be phosphorylated by PKC in vitro whereas Camp et al . 26 and Neame and Isacke 27 reported that phorbol ester treatment of cells did not alter the level of CD44 phosphorylation in vivo as monitored by incorporation of 32 P - orthophosphate . The availability of Ser325 - phosphorylation - specific mAbs provided an opportunity to monitor phosphorylation at this site specifically . Unexpectedly , treatment of human fibroblasts with phorbol esters to activate PKC resulted in a dramatic , time - dependent decrease in mAb 14E4 reac - tivity ( Fig . 2a ) . This phorbol - ester - induced loss of reactivity was not observed with the inactive analogue , α PDD ( Fig . 2b ) and could be blocked by the PKC inhibitor Ro - 31 ( Fig . 2c ) . Moreover , equivalent results were found with a variety of different cell types including melanoma cells , primary human T lymphoblasts , murine B lym - phoma cells and murine fibroblasts ( data not shown ) . The surpris - ing aspect of this data was that it suggested that activation of PKC resulted in dephosphorylation of CD44 at Ser325 thereby contra - dicting both sets of previously published data . To resolve this contradiction , a detailed analysis of both total CD44 phosphorylation and phosphorylation specifically at Ser325 was undertaken . 32 P - orthophosphate - labelled RPM - MC cells expressing WT CD44 were stimulated for 15 min or 45 min with phorbol ester and CD44 immunoprecipitated with mAb E1 / 2 . Phorbol - ester treatment did not result in any significant change in the overall level of WT CD44 phosphorylation ( Fig . 3a , IP E1 / 2 32 P ) or in CD44 expression as monitored by mAb E1 / 2 immunoblotting of parallel unlabelled cells ( Fig . 3a , Immunoblot E1 / 2 ) . But , as was observed with human fibroblasts ( Fig . 2a ) , phorbol - ester treatment induced a decrease in mAb 14E4 reactivity ( Fig . 3a , Immunoblot 14E4 ) and this was paralleled by a decrease in mAb 14E4 immuno - precipitation of 32 P - labelled WT CD44 ( Fig . 3a , IP 14E4 32 P ) indi - cating that Ser325 had been dephosphorylated . As Ser325 dephos - phorylation is not accompanied by a decrease in the overall level of CD44 phosphorylation this implies that a second phosphorylation event occurs concomitantly after phorbol - ester treatment .

As previously shown 22 , CD44 ( Thr325 ) is not phosphorylated in unstimulated cells ( Fig . 3b , IP E1 / 2 ) and does not react with mAbs 14E4 or 18E2 23 . After phorbol - ester treatment , however , the level of 32 P - labelled CD44 ( Thr325 ) is dramatically increased . Phosphoamino - acid analysis of the 32 P - labelled WT CD44 and CD44 ( Thr325 ) , both before and after phorbol - ester treatment , revealed that phosphory - lation was exclusively present on serine residue ( s ) ( Fig . 3c , d ) . These data demonstrate that , in unstimulated cells , CD44 is constitutive - ly phosphorylated solely at Ser325 and that phorbol - ester treat - ment results in both Ser325 dephosphorylation and a parallel phos - phorylation event at an alternate serine residue ( s ) . Together , these events maintain the overall level of CD44 phosphorylation . To identify the site of PKC phosphorylation , in vitro kinase assays were performed using GST – CD44 cytoplasmic - domain fusion proteins as substrates ( Fig . 4 ) . In these assays , GST – CD44 cytoplasmic domain and the deletion constructs GST – CD44 ∆ 337 – 361 , GST – CD44 ∆ 301 – 305 and GST – CD44 ∆ 311 – 316 showed a high level of PKC - mediated phosphorylation in vitro . However , the GST – CD44 ∆ 289 – 295 and GST – CD44 ∆ 289 – 291 mutants , with deletions encompassing a single serine residue ( Ser291 ) , showed undetectable levels of phosphorylation despite an equivalent amount of substrate in the assay ( Fig . 4b ) . Point muta - tions of Ser291 to either alanine , CD44 ( Ala291 ) , or aspartic acid , CD44 ( Asp291 ) , completely abolished phosphorylation ( Fig . 4c ) demonstrating that Ser291 is the sole site of PKC phosphorylation in the CD44 cytoplasmic domain . Ser291 regulates the CD44 – ezrin interaction . Comparison of the 72 - residue CD44 cytoplasmic domain sequence ( see Fig . 1a ) from the ten species sequenced to date reveals two regions , Asn290 – Asn304 and Leu318 – Lys334 , that are essentially complete - ly conserved from humans to birds . The two phosphorylation sites at Ser291 and Ser325 lie within these conserved domains . Moreover , Ser291 is adjacent to the Arg292 – Lys300 binding site for the ERM / merlin proteins 19 – 21 raising the possibility that phospho - rylation at this site may regulate the association of ERM proteins with CD44’s positively charged binding domain . To investigate this hypothesis , ezrin pulldown assays were performed with bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins of the CD44 cytoplasmic domain . Mutating Ser291 to an aspartic acid residue , which mimics a phos - phorylated serine , GST – CD44 ( Asp291 ) , resulted in a substantial reduction in the interaction of CD44 with ezrin in vitro compared with GST – CD44 . This loss of ezrin binding was dependent on the presence of a negative charge at the 291 position as no impairment was observed in a CD44 mutant with a neutral amino acid at this site , GST – CD44 ( Ala291 ) ( Fig . 5 ) . To determine whether activation of PKC regulates the associa - tion of CD44 and ezrin in vivo , FLIM was used to monitor FRET ( as described previously 18 , 28 – 31 ) between green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged CD44 ( CD44 – GFP ; donor ) and VSVG - tagged ezrin labelled with a Cy3 ( acceptor ) - conjugated anti - VSVG mAb . If donor and acceptor are in close proximity ( typically less than 10 nm ) FRET results in a reduction in GFP lifetime ( < (cid:2) > ) , which is manifested as phase shift and demodulation of the GFP emis - sion . The advantage of using FLIM to assess the donor fluores - cence lifetime is that this technique , as opposed to intensity - based measurements that monitor sensitized emission by the acceptor , is independent of chromophore concentration and light - path length and is therefore well suited to studies in intact cells 30 , 32 – 34 . In initial experiments , the extent of FRET was determined between WT CD44 – GFP and VSVG - tagged ezrin in unstimulated cells ( Fig . 6a ) . As seen in the fluorescence lifetime pseudocolour cell maps , there was a significant reduction in the fluorescence lifetime of the WT CD44 – GFP donor in the presence of the anti - VSVG - Cy3 acceptor ( + α VSVG - Cy3 , < (cid:2) > image ) , compared with the control donor lifetimes measured in the absence of the acceptor ( −α VSVG - Cy3 , < (cid:2) > image ) , indicating that FRET is occurring between WT CD44 – GFP and the Cy3 acceptor bound to VSVG - ezrin . This data demonstrates for the first time that CD44 associates with ezrin in intact cells . In order to determine the extent of FRET , the FRET effi - ciency ( Eff ) was calculated at each pixel as represented in the Eff pseudocolour cell map . For statistical analysis , the cumulative FRET efficiency data representing all pixels from ≥ 4 cells analysed was plotted as normalized pixel counts versus Eff ( bottom part of Fig . 6a ) . The grey line shows the Eff values measured in the absence of acceptor and represents the Eff values of donor ( GFP ) molecules in their non - complexed ( unbound ) state . The blue line shows the Eff values measured in the presence of acceptor . This analysis indi - cates that in unstimulated cells there is a significant amount of ezrin complexed with CD44 ( mean Eff value of 8 . 4 % represented by the dotted line ) . To determine the effects of PKC activation , cells were treated with phorbol ester . After a 40 min treatment ( Fig . 6b ) , there was a notable increase in the proportion of cell pixels with low Eff values — that is , pixels with Eff values close to that of donor in the absence of acceptor . This was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in the mean Eff value from 8 . 4 % to 6 . 7 % indicating a overall reduction in the proportion of ezrin complexed to CD44 . The maximal levels of acceptor fluorescence intensity ( + α VSVG ezrin - Cy3 ) were similar in both untreated and phorbol ester - stim - ulated cells , and there was no significant correlation between donor fluorescence lifetime ( < (cid:2) > , the average of (cid:2) p and (cid:2) m ; see legend to Fig . 6 for more detail ) and the intensity of acceptor fluorescence at each pixel of the cell ( data not shown ) . The observation that the proportion of WT CD44 bound to ezrin is significantly decreased after phorbol ester treatment is therefore independent of the expression level of the protein ( see ref . 30 for a more detailed account of the methodological approach ) . 5 10 0 30 60120 240 20 5 10 0 30 60 120240 20 112 84 58 49 P ho r bo l e s t e r α P DD R o - 31 + pho r bo l e s t e r M r ( K ) 112 84 58 49 M r ( K ) 112 84 58 49 M r ( K ) Time ( min ) E1 / 2 14E4 E1 / 2 14E4 E1 / 2 14E4 5 10 0 30 60 120 240 20 5 10 0 30 60120240 20 Time ( min ) 5 10 0 30 60120 240 20 5 10 0 30 60120240 20 Time ( min ) a b c Figure 2 Phorbol ester stimulation results in dephosphorylation of CD44 at Ser325 .

In unstimulated cells expressing this mutant ( Fig . 6c ) , the decrease in the GFP fluorescence lifetimes in the presence of the Cy3 acceptor were similar to those obtained with WT CD44 – GFP ( mean Eff value of 7 . 9 % ) indicating that an equivalent proportion of WT CD44 – GFP and CD44 ( Ala291 ) – GFP is complexed to ezrin in unstimulated cells . This data is consistent with that presented in Fig . 5 , demonstrating in vitro that CD44 ( Ala291 ) associates with ezrin to an equivalent level com - pared with WT CD44 . But after stimulation with phorbol ester for 40 min ( Fig . 6d ) , there was no net reduction in the fluorescent life - times of CD44 ( Ala291 ) – GFP , which resulted in a higher mean Eff value compared with WT CD44 – GFP ( mean Eff values of 8 . 3 % and 6 . 7 % , respectively ) . This demonstrates that in cells expressing CD44 ( Ala291 ) – GFP , ezrin association is not efficiently downregu - lated by phorbol - ester stimulation . In parallel , experiments were performed with a CD44 ( Asp291 ) – GFP mutant which mimics CD44 constitutively phosphorylated at Ser291 ( Fig . 6e ) . The decrease in the GFP fluorescence lifetimes of this mutant in the presence of the Cy3 acceptor ( mean of Eff value of 6 . 7 % ) was sig - nificantly lower than that obtained for WT CD44 – GFP in untreat - ed cells and closely resembled the lifetime profile of WT CD44 – GFP after 40 min phorbol - ester stimulation . A time - course analysis of WT CD44 and CD44 ( Ala291 ) – ezrin complexes in phorbol ester stimulated cells was undertaken ( Fig . 6f ) . Interestingly , at time points preceding Ser291 phosphory - lation ( 10 min and 20 min ) , the interaction between CD44 and ezrin is increased ( mean Eff values of 16 . 3 % and 14 . 4 % for WT CD44 and CD44 ( Ala291 ) , respectively ) . Coincidental with the onset of CD44 Ser291 phosphorylation , there was substantial dis - sociation ( 2 . 4 - fold ) of the WT CD44 – ezrin complexes such that by 40 min the amount of CD44 interacting with ezrin was decreased compared with that in unstimulated cells . Mutating Ser291 inhibit - ed this dissociation such that at 40 min the amount of CD44 ( Ala291 ) interacting with ezrin was equivalent to that in unstimulated cells . These data provide direct confirmation that turnover of CD44 – ezrin complexes is highly dynamic in vivo and that Ser291 has a key function in regulating this in response to acti - vation of PKC . CD44 Ser291 regulates directional cell motility . Both ERM proteins and CD44 have been implicated in the control of cell migration . We therefore took two complementary approaches to investigate whether the regulated turnover of CD44 – ezrin complexes was required for directional cell motility . In initial experiments , MDA - MB - 435 breast carcinoma cells were used ( Fig . 7a ) , as these cells constitutively express CD44 and ezrin , and in a Dunn - chamber assay they migrate directionally in a phorbol - ester gradient . To investigate the requirement for ezrin , a dominant - negative approach was taken . Microinjection of CD44 ( Ala291 ) , which binds ezrin and is impaired in its ability to dissociate from ezrin after phorbol - ester stimulation ( see Fig . 6c , d ) , abolished the chemotaxis of MDA - MB - 435 cells . This effect was dependent on mutation of the Ser291 residue , as cells microinjected with WT CD44 migrated direction - ally in the phorbol - ester gradient in a manner comparable with cells injected with vector alone . To assess the requirement for CD44 , NIH - 3T3 cells that do not constitutively undergo chemotaxis in a phorbol - ester gradient were used ( Fig . 7b ) . Microinjection of WT CD44 into these cells resulted in significant directional chemotaxis in response to phorbol ester . Again this effect was dependent on Ser291 , as no chemotactic response was observed in cells expressing the CD44 ( Ala291 ) mutant . Together , these results demonstrate that Ser291 phosphory - lation is required for CD44 – ezrin mediated directional cell motility . Discussion In resting cells , a large proportion ( between 25 % and 40 % ) of the transmembrane receptor CD44 is phosphorylated at a single residue , Ser325 ( refs 22 , 23 ) . Here we describe a novel CD44 phos - phorylation site at Ser291 and a mechanism by which changes in CD44 phosphorylation control receptor function . Our results demonstrate that CD44 phosphorylation is dually regulated by PKC in that kinase activation results in direct phosphorylation at Ser291 whilst co - ordinately mediating Ser325 dephosphorylation . This resolves a previous contradiction in the published literature where it had been reported that PKC can phosphorylate purified CD44 in vitro 25 but no change in overall cellular CD44 phosphory - lation is observed after phorbol - ester treatment 27 . Mechanistically , direct phosphorylation of CD44 at Ser291 could be expected as this residue lies in a strong PKC consensus site . Although the process of receptor dephosphorylation is less clear , it is not unprecedented . Both the natriuretic peptide receptor - B ( ref . 35 ) and K + channel Kv1 . 1 ( ref . 36 ) have been reported to become dephosphorylated after activation of PKC . For CD44 , the identification of PKC - responsive Ser325 phosphatases and / or signalling pathways leading to the inhibition of the Ser325 kinase will provide further impor - tant information as to how this dephosphorylation is co - ordinate - ly regulated with Ser291 phosphorylation . As the dual regulation of CD44 phosphorylation involves a large proportion of cellular CD44 , it suggests that switching between two discrete phosphorylation states may have a profound functional effect on the receptor . In this respect it was striking that the PKC phosphorylation site at Ser291 is located adjacent to the binding site for ERM proteins . This site contains two clusters of critically required , positively charged amino acids 19 , 20 ( Fig . 1a ) . Introducing an aspartic acid residue to mimic the phosphorylated 291 residue strongly reduces the CD44 – ezrin association in vitro , suggesting that adding a negatively charged phosphate group can antagonize the interaction of ERM proteins with their positively charged bind - ing domain , and that Ser291 phosphorylation functions to regulate CD44 association with ERM proteins . Although it has been exten - sively reported that CD44 is an interaction partner for ezrin , it has proved difficult to monitor this interaction in vivo using conven - Anti - Ezrin Coomassie 112 84 58 49 36 26 G S T G S T – C D 4 4 G S T – C D 4 4 ( A s p 2 9 1 ) G S T – C D 4 4 ( A l a 2 9 1 ) M r ( K ) Figure 5 Substituting aspartic acid for Ser291 reduces CD44 – ezrin associa - tion in vitro .

We used FLIM to monitor FRET between CD44 – GFP and Cy3 - conjugated antibody against ezrin to address this issue and to determine the physiological significance of Ser291 phosphorylation . As measured by FRET / FLIM , a significant extent of complex formation between these proteins is observed in unstimulated cells where CD44 Ser291 is not phosphorylated . Importantly , this interaction is significantly reduced in cells expressing a CD44 ( Asp291 ) , but not a CD44 ( Ala291 ) , mutant . After activation of PKC , the association between CD44 and ezrin is transiently increased at time points when phosphorylation at Ser291 and dephosphorylation at Ser325 is incomplete ( 10 min and 20 min ) . This is perhaps unsurprising , as phorbol - ester stimulation is known to result in phosphorylation of ezrin at Thr567 by PKC , or a PKC - associated kinase 18 , and that this phosphorylation event suppresses ERM intramolecular interactions and increases the availability of the actin - binding sites 7 , 8 . This suggests that the pool of ezrin available to interact with CD44 or CD44 ( Ala291 ) is increased and may coincide with transition in membrane - associ - ated ezrin from non - phosphorylated oligomer to phosphorylated monomer 13 . In contrast to the early timepoints , after 40 min of phorbol - ester treatment , when phosphorylation at Ser291 is com - plete , the level of complex formation between WT CD44 and ezrin is reduced compared with that observed in unstimulated cells . The observation that association of CD44 ( Ala291 ) and ezrin is the same in cells treated for 0 and 40 min with phorbol esters , sup - ports the conclusion that this dissociation is driven by Ser291 phosphorylation , but the relatively slow time course of CD44 Ser291 phosphorylation indicates an additional level of control . This could be the consequence of either dephosphorylation of the CD44 Ser325 residue being required for correct subcellular parti - tioning of CD44 or the requirement for active PKC to be recruited to the CD44 cytoplasmic domain . This latter hypothesis is partic - ularly attractive as a tight association occurs between ezrin and active PKC 18 . The FRET / FLIM technology we have described here uses widefield microscopy that is sufficiently sensitive to depict quantitatively the degree of donor – acceptor proximity , although confocal , multiphoton FLIM will be required before precise sub - cellular resolution of CD44 – ERM complexes in unstimulated and stimulated cells can be obtained . Further , in order to correlate the interactions between CD44 – ezrin and PKC – ezrin , time - correlated single - photon counting ( TCSPC ) techniques that monitor the flu - orescence - decay kinetics of sensitized emission from Cy3 ( ezrin ) , by exciting the GFP ( CD44 ) in the presence or absence of a Cy5 - labelled PKC will be required so that these three components can be monitored simultaneously at each cell pixel . The data presented here and in previous work 18 demonstrates an intimate association between CD44 , ezrin and PKC . As these three components have all been implicated in the control of directed cel - lular motility 15 – 18 , 29 , 37 – 41 , we investigated whether changes in CD44 phosphorylation at Ser291 are involved in regulating cell migra - tion . Our results demonstrate that dynamic association and dis - sociation of CD44 and ezrin in response to polarized activation of PKC allows cells to move directionally and , moreover , that this requires changes in CD44 Ser291 phosphorylation . It has been established that phorbol - ester gradients can modulate chemotaxis by a number of mechanisms including Rac1 - dependent cell polar - ization and lamellipodia formation 42 , increased turnover of stress fibres and focal adhesions 43 , and stimulation of Cdc42 and N - WASP recruitment to sites of actin polymerization 44 , but little is known of how these intracellular changes are co - ordinated with extracellular signals . Our data suggests that the transmembrane receptor CD44 in conjunction with PKC may function in such a way by orchestrating the polarized turnover of membrane – cytoskeletal junctional complexes in response to changes in the extracellular matrix 45 or other external stimuli . Further studies will be required to establish how this turnover is involved in modulat - ing the cortical actin structure and in controlling directed cell movement in response to environmental change . Methods Peptides CD44 peptides ( Fig . 1a ; Mimotopes , Heswall , UK ) were between 87 % and 92 % purity as determined by analytical reverse - phase high - performance liquid chromatography ( RP - HPLC ) and ion - spray mass spectrometry and contained an amido group at their carboxyl termini . In addition , the SP CD44 phos - phopeptide was obtained conjugated to KLH through a C - terminal cysteine residue . The SM2 ( CSPLR S PKKPT ) and SM3 ( CPHIPR S PYKF ) peptides , where the bold S indicates a phosphoserine were provided by Sibylle Mittnacht , Institute of Cancer Research . Antibodies For generation of mAbs 14E4 and 18E2 , BALB / c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 0 . 1mg of KLH - conjugated SP CD44 phosphopeptide mixed with Freunds adjuvant on weeks 0 , 4 , 7 and 10 . On week12 , 0 . 1mg of peptide was injected intravenously and 3days later spleens were removed and fused with NSOI myeloma cells . Hybridoma supernatants were screened by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) assay as follows : peptides were made up at a concentration of 5mgml − 1 in 10mM sodium phosphate pH7 . 0 and 50 µ l plated into 96 - well high - bind plates ( Costar , Cambridge , MA ) and left overnight at 4 ° C . The following day the plates were washed in PBS , blocked for 3 h at room temperature in 3 % bovine serum albumin in PBS and washed in PBS . Hybridoma supernatants ( 50 µ l ) were added to the wells for 1h at room temperature , the plates washed in PBS and then 50 µ l of 300ngml − 1 HRP - anti mouse Ig added for 1h at room temperature . The plates were washed in PBS and developed with o - phenylenediamine dihydrochloride ( OPD ) peroxidase and the reaction stopped after 5 – 10min by the addition of 50 µ l of 12 . 5 % H 2 SO 4 and then absorbance at 450nm was read . Positive hybridomas were subjected to two rounds of subcloning by limiting dilution . E1 / 2 is a mouse mAb specific for an extracellular epitope in human CD44 , IM7 is a cross - species reactive rat mAb that recognizes an extracellular CD44 epitope . Anti - VSVG mAb was purchased from Roche Diagnostics Ltd ( Lewes , UK ) and directly conjugated to the fluorophore Cy3 as described previ - ously 46 . An anti - ezrin polyclonal antiserum was raised by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with bacterially expressed full - length human ezrin . Cells All cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % foetal calf serum ( FCS ) except NIH - 3T3 cells which were cultured in 10 % donor calf serum . Clonal lines of RPM - MC human melanoma cells expressing WT CD44 or CD44 ( Thr325 ) have been described previously 22 . Cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE reagent ( Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ) or microinjected using an Eppendorf ( Cambridge , UK ) microinjection system . For FRET / FLIM analysis cells were fixed in 3 % paraformaldehyde for 15min , permeabilized with 0 . 2 % saponin and then either viewed directly or stained with a Cy3 - anti - VSVG mAb . Immunoblot analysis was carried out as described previously 44 . Levels of endogenous murine CD44 expression in NIH - 3T3 cells were characterized by western blotting and fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) analysis and demonstrated to be 4 . 2 - fold lower than on human Flow2000 fibroblasts . Further details on the charac - terization of the NIH - 3T3 cells used in this study can be obtained from C . M . I . Figure 6 Phorbol ester stimulation reduces CD44 - ezrin association in vivo . NIH - 3T3 cells expressing WT CD44 – GFP and ezrin - VSVG ( a , b ) , CD44 ( Ala291 ) – GFP and ezrin - VSVG ( c , d ) or CD44 ( Asp291 ) – GFP and ezrin - VSVG ( e ) were left unstimu - lated ( − phorbol ester ) ( a , c , e ) or stimulated for 40 min with 1 µ M PDBu ( + phorbol ester ) ( b , d ) . Cells were then fixed and left unstained ( − α VSVG - Cy3 ) or stained with Cy - 3 - conjugated anti - VSVG antibody ( + α VSVG - Cy3 ) . FLIM was undertaken to deter - mine the extent of FRET between the CD44 – GFP donor and anti - VSVG - Cy3 accep - tor . FRET results in a shortening of the GFP fluorescence lifetime which is meas - ured as two independent parameters , the phase shift ( (cid:2) p ) and the relative modula - tion depth ( (cid:2) m ) . In the upper parts of a – e , GFP and Cy3 indicate the fluorescence images from the CD44 – GFP or CD44 ( Ala291 ) – GFP and α VSVG - Cy3 , respectively . < (cid:2) > indicates the donor fluorescence lifetime ( the average of (cid:2) p and (cid:2) m ) pseudo - colour cell maps , with scale shown beneath . The presence of FRET ( from GFP to Cy3 ) was confirmed by photobleaching the Cy3 acceptor , resulting in a lengthening of the donor < (cid:2) > ( data not shown ) . Eff indicates the pixel - by - pixel FRET efficiency represented on a pseudocolour cell map with scale shown beneath ( Eff = 1 − (cid:2) da / (cid:2) d , where (cid:2) da is the lifetime map of the donor in the presence of acceptor and (cid:2) d is the average lifetime < (cid:2) > of the donor in the absence of acceptor , numerically taken as the average of mean < (cid:2) > of at least four control cells that were not stained with the anti - VSVG - Cy3 Ab . The FRET efficiency ( Eff ) pseudocolour plots only apply to the + α VSVG - Cy3 lifetime maps . In the lower parts of a – e , the profile of normalized pixel counts versus Eff ( % ) summarizes all the FRET efficiency data for each treat - ment . The grey line represents the profile of Eff values measured in the absence of acceptor . The profiles of Eff values measured in the presence of acceptor are shown as blue ( WT CD44 ) , pink ( CD44 ( Ala291 ) ) or green ( CD44 ( Asp291 ) ) lines .

CD44 ( Asp291 ) – GFP was similarly generated using the forward ( 5 ′ - GCATTGCAGT - CAAC GA CCGAAGAAGGTGTGG - 3 ′ ) and reverse ( 5 ′ - CCACACCTTCTTCG GTC GTTGACTGCAAT - GC - 3 ′ ) oligonucleotides . GST – CD44 ( Ala291 ) and GST – CD44 ( Asp291 ) were generated using GST – WTCD44 in the pGEX - KG vector 18 as a template with forward ( 5 ′ - GGAATTGTCAAC GC TC - GAAGAAGGTGTGGGCAG - 3 ′ ) and reverse ( 5 ′ - CTGCCCACACCTTCTTCGA GC GTTGACAATTCC - 3 ′ ) oligonucleotides for Ala291 , and forward ( 5 ′ - GGAATTGTCAAC GAC CGAAGAAGGT - GTGGGCAG - 3 ′ ) and reverse ( 5 ′ - CTGCCCACACCTTCTTCG GTC GTTGACAATTCC - 3 ′ ) oligonu - cleotides for Asp291 . The pCB6EzTAG VSVG - tagged ezrin expression vectorand CD44 – GFP expres - sion vector , and characterization of the tagged proteins , are described elsewhere 13 , 48 . GST fusion pro - teins were expressed in bacteria and ezrin pulldown assays performed as described previously 19 . Phosphorylation analysis 32 P - orthophosphate labelling of cells and CD44 immunoprecipitation was as described previously 23 . For phosphatase treatment , immunoprecipitated CD44 bound to protein G - Sepharose was washed twice in RIPA buffer ( 15 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 % sodium deoxy - cholate , 0 . 3 % SDS , 2 mM EDTA , 0 . 2 mM sodium orthovanadate , 25 mM sodium fluoride , 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate ) and twice in phosphatase buffer ( 20mM Tris , 2mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 01 % TritonX - 100 , 10 % glycerol and 0 . 5mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , pH9 . 8 ) and resuspended in 50 µ l of phosphatase buffer . 10 – 15U of type VII S alkaline phosphatase ( Sigma , Dorset , UK ) was added and the reactions incubated at 37 ° C for 30min . A further 10 – 15U of alkaline phosphatase was then added to the sam - ple and incubated for another 30min at 37 ° C . Phosphoamino - acid analysis was performed as described previously 49 . For PKC in vitro kinase assays , GST – fusion proteins bound to glutathione agarose were resuspended in 50 µ l of PKC buffer ( 20mM HEPES pH7 . 4 , 100 µ M CaCl 2 , 10mM MgCl 2 , 100 µ M ATP , 0 . 03 % TritonX - 100 ) . Then 10 µ l of a lipid mix containing 10 µ g of phos - phatidylserine and 2 µ g of diacylglycerol , 35ng of rat brain PKC ( Cat No 539484 , Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) and 2 µ Ci of γ 32 P - ATP was added and the reactions incubated at 30 ° C for 30min . FRET determination by FLIM measurements NIH - 3T3 cells at 60 - 70 % confluency were transiently cotransfected with WT CD44 – GFP , CD44 ( Ala291 ) – GFP or CD44 ( Asp291 ) – GFP and VSVG - tagged ezrin ( plasmid ratio of CD44 : VSVG - ezrin = 1 : 2 ) . Sixteen hours after transfection cells were trypsinized and replated onto cover - slips . After 36h cells were stimulated with 1 µ M phorbol 12 , 13 - dibutyrate ( PDBu ) for 0 – 40min . Cells were then fixed and either left as controls ( − α VSVG - Cy3 ) or stained with Cy3 - conjugated anti - VSVG antibody ( + α VSVG - Cy3 ) . A detailed description of the FLIM apparatus used for FRET determination can be found elsewhere 30 , 32 . The lifetime instrument performs phase and modulation based imaging flu - orimetry by microscopy . All images were taken using a Zeiss Plan - APOCHROMAT 100 × / 1 . 4NA phase 3 oil objective and the homodyne phase sensitive images recorded at a modulation frequency of 80 . 224 MHz . The donor ( CD44 – GFP ) was excited using the 488nm line of an argon / krypton laser and the resultant fluorescence separated using a combination of dichroic beamsplitter ( Q 505 LP ; Chroma Technology Corp . , Brattleboro , VT ) and narrow band emitter filter ( BP514 / 10 ; Lys & Optik , Lyngby , Denmark ) . Acceptor images ( Cy3 - conjugated anti - VSVG antibody ) were recorded using a 100W Mercury arc lamp ( Zeiss Attoarc ) as a source of sample illumination combined with a high Q Cy3 filter set ( exciter : HQ 535 / 50 , dichroic : Q 565 LP , emitter : HQ 610 / 75 LP ; Chroma Technology Corp . ) . Cell chemotaxis assay MDA - MB - 435 plated onto uncoated coverslips or NIH - 3T3 cells plated onto coverslips coated with 10 µ gml − 1 laminin were cultured overnight . The following day , cells were left untreated or microinject - ed in the nucleus with pSR α vector alone , pSR α - WT CD44 or pSR α - CD44 ( Ala291 ) plasmid DNA ( 100 µ gml − 1 ) together with a Cy3 - conjugated anti - transferrin receptor Ab for subsequent identifica - tion of injected cells . For some experiments pSR α - WT CD44 – GFP and pSR α - CD44 ( Ala291 ) – GFP plasmids were used in the absence of Cy3 - conjugated anti - transferrin receptor Ab . Equivalent results were obtained with CD44 and CD44 – GFP constructs . Coverslips were placed on a Dunn direct - view - ing chamber containing 1 µ M PDBu in the outer well of the chamber . Cell migration was recorded overnight at a 5min time lapse - interval using a 10 × objective and the images were acquired using Kinetic Imaging ( Merseyside , UK ) AQM software . Analysis of the directionality ( δ y ) data was per - formed by manually tracking cells within each field over the sequence of time - lapse digital images ( Motion Analysis , Kinetic Imaging ) . Each ‘resultant’ cell trajectory taken above the 20 µ m horizon was converted into a single angle and all resultant trajectories were then pooled and summarized in a cir - cular histogram showing the number of cell directions lying within 18 ° intervals 50 . Significant chemo - taxis was observed with NIH - 3T3 cells expressing CD44 when cells were plated on fibronectin instead of laminin , but not poly - L - lysine ( data not shown ) .
