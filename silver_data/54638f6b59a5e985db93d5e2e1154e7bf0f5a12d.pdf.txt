No independent life forms on earth can survive without iron . However , excess iron is intimately associated with carcinogenesis by increasing oxidative stress via its catalytic activity to generate hydroxyl radicals . Biomolecules with redox - active sulfhydryl function ( s ) ( thiol compounds ) are necessary for the maintenance of mildly reductive cellular environments to counteract oxidative stress , and for the execution of redox reactions for metabolism and detoxiﬁcation . Involvement of glutathione S - transferase and thioredoxin has long attracted the attention of cancer researchers . Here , I update recent ﬁndings on the involvement of iron and thiol compounds during carcinogenesis and in cancer cells . It is now recognized that the cystine / glutamate transporter ( antiporter ) is intimately associated with ferroptosis , an iron - dependent , non - apoptotic form of cell death , observed in cancer cells , and also with cancer stem cells ; the former with transporter blockage but the latter with its stabilization . Excess iron in the presence of oxygen appears the most common known mutagen . Ironically , the persistent activation of antioxidant systems via genetic alterations in Nrf2 and Keap1 also contributes to carcinogenesis . Therefore , it is difﬁcult to conclude the role of iron and thiol compounds as friends or foes , which depends on the quantity / distribution and induction / ﬂexibility , respectively . Avoiding further mutation would be the most helpful strategy for cancer prevention , and myriad of efforts are being made to sort out the weaknesses of cancer cells . Keywords : iron , carcinogenesis , glutathione , oxidative stress , cancer stem cell , ferroptosis , peroxiredoxins , Nrf2 INTRODUCTION During the past 6 – 7 decades following World War II , the average human lifespan has been enormously extended from less than 50 years to nearly or more than 80 years in most developed countries ( https : / / www . cia . gov / library / publications / the - world - factbook / rankorder / 2102rank . html ) . This has been achieved at least in part by the discovery of antibiotics against bacterial infections such as tuberculosis , which had been contin - uously present deadly diseases until that period ( Zhang , 2005 ) . After the major human conquest over bacterial diseases , two pathologic conditions , atherosclerosis and cancer , have become the most common causes of human mortality . Atherosclerosis via the thickening of the arterial intima and rupture of atheroma - tous plaques causes myocardial and cerebral infarctions , which either kill the patients or dramatically decrease their quality of lives ( Beckman et al . , 2002 ) . Atherosclerosis is , in a sense , an “ana - log” disease in that apparently nobody can escape from it ( Kumar et al . , 2013 ) ; rather , the speed of disease progression is much different among individuals , which is revealed with mathemat - ical models ( Hao and Friedman , 2014 ) ( Figure 1 ) . In contrast , cancer is a “digital” disease , which means that it consists of stepwise processes and is all or nothing for the generation of a malignant tumor ( Weinberg , 2013 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Some patients develop secondary or even tertiary cancers after successful cancer treatments ( Travis et al . , 2013 ) . In this review , I will focus on the recent advancements in the understanding of cancer regard - ing iron and thiol compounds that appears independent but are interdependent in many aspects . CANCER AS A GENOMIC DISEASE Since the discovery of oncogenes , decades of studies have revealed that cancer is basically a disease of the genomic alter - ation ( Weinberg , 2013 ) . Alteration of genome information after genomic damage and its inadequate repair is responsible for cancer development , and the alterations should occur in spe - ciﬁc genes designated as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes ( Figure 2 ) . There are more than 100 oncogenes identiﬁed thus far , and all of these genes are associated with cellular prolif - eration ( Weinberg , 2013 ) . Oncogene activation is the result of speciﬁc mutations in genes , leading to persistent activation of cel - lular signals toward proliferation . The genetic alterations include point mutations , gene ampliﬁcations , or gene fusions ( Stratton et al . , 2009 ; Pleasance et al . , 2010 ) . Tumor suppressor genes work as guardians of the genome by arresting the cell cycle , repair - ing the genome , and even inducing apoptosis after unrepairable excessive genomic injury occurs . These genes are inactivated during the carcinogenic process . It is now recognized that sev - eral ( e . g . , 5 – 8 ) independent or interdependent events of mixed www . frontiersin . org August 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 200 | 1 Toyokuni Iron and thiol compounds in carcinogenesis FIGURE 1 | Differences between atherosclerosis and carcinogenesis as oxidative stress - induced diseases . activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes are necessary to generate a malignant tumor ( Hanahan and Weinberg , 2000 ) . Certain genetic alterations work as an instigator , facilitating the occurrence of sequential independent alterations at a signiﬁcantly higher incidence ( mutator pheno - type ) ( Loeb , 2001 ) . This is especially true of repair genes for the genome . Both alleles have to be disrupted to inactivate tumor suppressor genes . In addition , not only genetic alterations but also epigenetic changes ( methylation of the promoter region ) are important in halting the expression of speciﬁc genes ( Feinberg et al . , 2006 ) . As an exception , epigenetic alterations may lead to a malignant tumor in childhood cancer ( Esteller and Herman , 2002 ) . Recently , it was shown that doxycycline - controlled reprogrammable trans - genic mice overexpressing the four Yamanaka factors ( Oct3 / 4 , Sox2 , Klf4 , and c - Myc ) for induced pluripotent stem cell genera - tion develop several cancers similar to childhood blastoma - type cancer that do not revert to normal and continue dysplas - tic growth , even after switching off those genes . Surprisingly , these cancers reportedly do not have major alterations of the genes , suggesting the importance of epigenetic mecha - nisms as well ( Ohnishi et al . , 2014 ) . However , it was recently determined by next generation sequencing that genes regulat - ing epigenetic mechanisms are one of the major targets of carcinogenesis in certain cancers such as leukemia and breast carcinoma ( Smith et al . , 2010 ; Dawson and Kouzarides , 2012 ) . Thus , in most cases , genetic alterations regulate epigenetic mechanisms . FIGURE 2 | Molecular carcinogenic processes in terms of oxidative stress . IRON AS A RISK OF CANCER Iron is the most abundant metal in the human body . Approximately 4 g is present in normal adult humans . Thus , far , no life on earth can live without iron . Simultaneously , most of higher organisms , including humans , cannot survive without oxygen for 5 min . Oxygen is transported throughout the body by the heme moiety of hemoglobin , which contains as much as ∼ 60 % of the total iron in the body ( Wriggleworth and Baum , 1980 ; Toyokuni , 2011a ) . Thus , there is a natural afﬁnity between iron and oxygen . The most important characteristic of molecular oxygen is that it is easy to be reduced via one or more of four one - electron transfer processes , ending with the formation of water ( Figure 3 ) . During this process , superoxide , hydrogen peroxide , and hydroxyl radicals may be generated as intermediates either via enzymatic or chemical reactions . Hydroxyl radicals are most reac - tive among chemical species of the biological system . Fortunately , unfavorable reactions of this kind is usually prevented via antiox - idative mechanisms ( Halliwell and Gutteridge , 2007 ; Toyokuni , 2011b ) . Whereas iron is an essential component , stable Fe [ III ] is hardly soluble at neutral pH ( 10 − 17 M ) ( Lippard and Berg , 1994 ) . Therefore , precise and overlapping regulatory mechanisms exist Frontiers in Pharmacology | Experimental Pharmacology and Drug Discovery August 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 200 | 2 Toyokuni Iron and thiol compounds in carcinogenesis in iron metabolism , and thus , only subtle amounts of catalytic iron are present in normal physiological conditions . Pathologic conditions , such as failure of iron regulatory sensors , repeated hemorrhage and chronic inﬂammation concomitant with con - tinued parenchymal cell death , result in iron overload in the corresponding locations ( Ganz , 2003 ) , leading to oxidative dam - age through the Fenton reaction ( Minotti and Aust , 1989 ; Miller et al . , 1990 ; Halliwell and Gutteridge , 2007 ) . Hydroxyl radicals are the most reactive species in the biological system , and the Fenton reaction in vivo appears to occur in the presence of cat - alytic ferrous iron ( Samuni et al . , 1983 ; Toyokuni , 2009 ) , leading to the extensive scission , modiﬁcation ( Dizdaroglu , 1991 ) and cross - linking of biomolecules ( Dizdaroglu , 1991 ) . Such oxidative molecules eventually induce genomic alterations , increasing the risk of carcinogenesis . Recently , prompt formation of mono - or poly - iron Fe IV = O ( ferryl ) species was suggested at the aqueous interface ( Enami et al . , 2014 ) . Indeed , iron overload has been associated with carcinogene - sis both in human and animal experiments . It is well known that there is no active excretion pathway for iron except for hemor - rhage , presumably due to the supreme biological importance of iron . Intriguingly , a US epidemiological study published in 2008 reported that for peripheral arterial disease patients , phlebotomy twice a year reduced the incidence of visceral cancer by 35 % and the cancer mortality by 61 % in a randomized trial involving 1277 patients . In this study , iron reduction did not stop the progression FIGURE 3 | Oxygen as a medium for electron ﬂow and the associated role of catalytic ferrous iron ( Fe [ II ] ) toward Fenton reaction . Note that only a small fraction generates hydroxyl radicals ( · OH ) . Refer to text and Figure 7 . of atherosclerosis , as originally intended , but did unexpectedly prevent carcinogenesis , including that of most common cancers ( lung , colon , prostate , etc . ) ( Zacharski et al . , 2007 ) . There are several review articles published on the direct demonstration of iron overload and carcinogenesis in animal experiments ( Toyokuni , 1996 , 2002 , 2009 ; Beguin et al . , 2014 ) , which I summarize as Table 1 . Now , the role of iron in human car - cinogenesis remains under intensive discussion ( Cho et al . , 2013 ; Fonseca - Nunes et al . , 2014 ) . Here , I discuss the recent results from a genuine Fenton reaction - induced carcinogenesis model generated by intraperitoneal injections of an iron chelate , fer - ric nitrilotriacetate ( Fe - NTA ) , to rodents ( Ebina et al . , 1986 ; Li et al . , 1987 ) . Nitrilotriacetate ( NTA ) has been used as a com - ponent of detergents in Canada because of its potent chelating activity with a variety of metals , including iron ( Anderson et al . , 1982 ) . First , Fe - NTA was used to load Fe [ III ] to transferrin , a serum iron transporting protein , in biochemistry laboratories ( Pootrakul et al . , 1977 ) . Then , it was used by Awai et al . to gener - ate an animal model of hemochromatosis ( Awai et al . , 1979 ) . Of note , Okada and Midorikawa found that Fe - NTA induces renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) after repeated intraperitoneal administra - tion in wild - type rats ( Figure 4 ) that were accidentally under observation for more than 1 year after the conﬁrmation of iron accumulation in the liver ( Okada and Midorikawa , 1982 ) . Fe - NTA is soluble at neutral pH and is the most potent catalyst thus far of Fenton reaction with 3 – 4 free iron ligands ( Toyokuni and Sagripanti , 1992 , 1993 ) . After intraperitoneal injection , Fe - NTA is absorbed through the peritoneum into the portal vein and then enters the sys - temic blood ﬂow . Thereafter , Fe - NTA is ﬁltered through the glomeruli into the lumina of the renal proximal tubules , where Fe ( III ) - NTA is reduced to Fe ( II ) - NTA , presumably by the pres - ence of L - cysteine ( Okada et al . , 1993 ; Okada , 1996 ) ( Figure 5 ) . The Fenton reaction indeed occurs in vivo in rats and mice because a variety of modiﬁed products are demonstrated in this model , including 4 - hydroxy - 2 - nonenal ( HNE ) ( Toyokuni et al . , 1997a ) , HNE - modiﬁed proteins ( Toyokuni et al . , 1994b ; Fukuda et al . , 1996b ) , other lipid peroxidation products ( Toyokuni et al . , 1990 ; Uchida et al . , 1995 ) , 8 - oxoguanine ( Toyokuni et al . , 1994a , 1997b ) , thymine - tyrosine cross - links ( Toyokuni et al . , 1995a ) and other oxidative DNA base modiﬁcations ( Toyokuni et al . , 1994a ) .

K , normal kidney of the opposite side ; L , liver ; T , testis . FIGURE 5 | Molecular mechanism of ferric nitrilotriacetate ( Fe - NTA ) - induced oxidative damage of renal proximal tubules after a single intraperitoneal injection . This depends on two distinct characteristics of renal proximal tubular lumina : paucity of antioxidattive proteins such as albumin and reductive environment through the presence of L - cysteine with GSH cycles . DNA single - and double - stranded breaks have also been shown in vitro ( Toyokuni and Sagripanti , 1993 , 1996 ) . Recently , we demonstrated an abundance of Fe ( II ) in the lumina of renal proximal tubules after Fe - NTA injection ( Mukaide et al . , 2014 ) with a novel ﬂuorescent probe ( RhoNox - 1 ) speciﬁc for catalytic ferrous iron ( Hirayama et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , we showed that the induced RCCs have massive chromosomal alterations similar to those of human cancers , of which the ampliﬁcation of c - Met ( receptor for hepatocyte growth factor ) and deletion of Cdkn2a / 2b ( p16 Ink4a / p15 Ink4b tumor sup - pressor genes ) are most common ( Tanaka et al . , 1999 ; Akatsuka et al . , 2012 ) . The latter occurs early in carcinogenesis ( Hiroyasu et al . , 2002 ) . Considering that it is rare thus far to ﬁnd mas - sive chromosomal alterations in any other carcinogenesis model using wild - type animals , we believe that iron overload is one of the most important risk factors in human carcinogenesis as well . Of note , asbestos - ( Jiang et al . , 2012 ) and multi - walled carbon nanotube - induced ( Nagai et al . , 2011 ) mesothelial carcinogenesis in wild - type rats are the models that confer massive chromo - somal alterations including homozygous deletion of Cdkn2a / 2b . We believe that these are through local iron overload ( Toyokuni , 2013b ) . There are several distinct human diseases that preclude can - cer via iron overload ( Table 2 ) . Endometriosis is deﬁned by the presence of endometrial tissue outside of the uterine cavity and occurs in as many as 10 % of women in their reproductive years . An epidemiological study revealed that ovarian endometriosis is associated with a high risk for clear cell carcinoma ( Pearce et al . , 2012 ) . Because monthly menstrual hemorrhage occurs in these ectopic tissues , local iron overload is generated in situ ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2008 ) . We recently studied endometriosis - associated ovar - ian clear cell carcinoma with an array - based comparative genome hybridization and found that c - Met ( the same target gene as those of Fe - NTA - induced RCCs ) is the most frequently ampliﬁed gene ( Yamashita et al . , 2013 ) . Recently , it was shown with the use of knockout mice for Cdkn2a / 2b and / or Pten that DNA double - stranded breaks cooperate with the loss of Ink4 and Arf ( pro - tein products from Cdkn2a / 2b after alternative splicing ) tumor suppressors to generate glioblastomas with frequent c - Met ampli - ﬁcation ( Camacho et al . , 2014 ) . It is remarkable that all of the necessary genomic alterations occurred in the Fe - NTA - induced RCC model of wild - type animals . Together , these results indicate that the Fenton reaction can induce deletion / ampliﬁcation mutations in target genes dur - ing carcinogenesis , presumably through DNA double - stranded breaks ( Figure 6 ) . Currently , next - generation sequencing stud - ies are in progress for the above - mentioned tumors and may help determine whether iron overload can induce driver point mutations and create fusion genes through chromosomal translocations . REGULATION OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE VIA THIOL COMPOUNDS Here I discuss the other partner of Fenton reaction , hydro - gen peroxide . Hydrogen peroxide , a non - radical species , is a normal metabolite occurring at an approximately 10 nM intra - cellular concentration . Its increase in concentration may initi - ate Fenton reaction in the presence of catalytic Fe [ II ] . In the liver , which has one of the highest metabolic activities in the body , hydrogen peroxide is produced at 50 nmol / min / g tissue ( Sies , 2014 ) .

FIGURE 6 | Consequences of Fenton reaction in the genome DNA during carcinogenesis . HNE , 4 - hydroxy - 2 - nonenal . the regulation of the concentration and localization of hydro - gen peroxide is a critical issue . It is now widely accepted that hydrogen peroxide is utilized in metabolic regulation in ways sim - ilar to diffusible gasses such as CO , NO , and H 2 S ( Yang et al . , 2008 ) . A major source of hydrogen peroxide comes from the dismu - tation of the superoxide anion radical , which is mainly generated through NAD ( P ) H oxidases operated under the control of growth factors and cytokines , such as interleukin - 1 and tumor necro - sis factor - α ( Jiang et al . , 2011 ) . This mechanism is actively used for antibacterial defense in neutrophils and macrophages during inﬂammation ( Bedard and Krause , 2007 ) . Another major source of hydrogen peroxide resides in the physiological mitochondrial processes through Complex I , II , and III ( Cadenas and Davies , 2000 ) . The metabolic elimination of hydrogen peroxide includes the catalytic reaction , which is performed by catalase in peroxisomes as well as by numerous peroxidases ( Figure 7 ) . In addition , in tis - sues , hydrogen peroxide diffuses away from its source across the plasma membrane to the extracellular space , or even to adjoin - ing cells , occurs ( Giorgio et al . , 2007 ) . Various peroxidases are under the control of metabolic signals , and the most potent per - oxidase is peroxiredoxins ( Rhee et al . , 2005 ) . The 10 6 - fold higher rate constant of the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with the cys - teine thiolate in peroxiredoxins using thioredoxin as a substrate in comparison to most other deprotonated thiol compounds gives them a major role in the biological chemistry of hydro - gen peroxide removal ( Winterbourn , 2013 ) . However , cysteine residues of peroxiredoxins are easily hyperoxidized to cysteine sulﬁnic acid , resulting in the inactivation of peroxidase activity . As a result , if this occurs , there is an accumulation of hydro - gen peroxide , allowing the oxidation of speciﬁc target proteins , a phenomenon that is comparable to the opening of a gate for signaling ( Wood et al . , 2003 ) . This is the molecular basis for hydrogen peroxide compartmentation in signaling ( Antunes and Cadenas , 2000 ) ( Figure 7 ) . This activation is ﬁnally shut down by sulﬁredoxin , which recovers hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins ( Jeong et al . , 2012 ) . Glutathione peroxidases in various distinct sub - cellular compartments and cells play a major function in the regulation of hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides ( Brigelius - Flohe and Maiorino , 2013 ) . Glutathione reductase and the efﬂux of oxidized glutathione ( GSSG ) allow the maintenance of the fraction of reduced glutathione ( Sies , 1999 ) . Thioredoxin per - oxidase , a selenium - dependent enzyme , also has an important role in the elimination of hydrogen peroxide ( Lu and Holmgren , 2014 ) . Recently , hydrogen peroxide has been shown to use water channels , the aquaporins , to cross the lipid membrane more rapidly than diffusion allows ( Bienert et al . , 2006 ) . Speciﬁc aqua - porins promote the diffusion of hydrogen peroxide and are thus referred to as peroxiporins ( Bienert et al . , 2007 ) . Aquaporin - 8 can modulate the transport of hydrogen peroxide produced by NAD ( P ) H oxidase in leukemia cells ( Bienert et al . , 2007 ) , suggesting novel targets for cancer therapy in that , in general , www . frontiersin . org August 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 200 | 5 Toyokuni Iron and thiol compounds in carcinogenesis FIGURE 7 | Antagonizing role of iron and thiol compounds . Numerous overlapping mechanisms using thiol compounds exist to decompose hydrogen peroxide to water in order to bypass the generation of hydroxyl radicals . Hydrogen peroxide is now recognized as a signaling molecule whose main regulator is the peroxiredoxin / sulﬁredoxin systems , which are at least partially under the control of the Nrf2 / Keap1 system . Some cancers hijack Nrf2 / Keap1 system with mutation in these genes , which persistently activate antioxidant systems in the cancer cells . Refer to text and Figure 8 for details . cancer cells are under persistent oxidative stress ( Toyokuni et al . , 1995b ) . THIOL - DEPENDENT ANTIOXIDANT SYSTEMS AND CANCER The GSH and thioredoxin systems are generally activated in cancer ( Tanaka et al . , 1997 ; Dutta et al . , 2005 ; Nogueira and Hay , 2013 ; Penney and Roy , 2013 ; Traverso et al . , 2013 ) . Among them , there has been much interest in the overexpression of GSH S - transferase in rodent hepatocarcinogenesis ( Hatayama et al . , 1993 ) and in human cancers ( Huang et al . , 2013 ; Tang et al . , 2013 ) . GSH S - transferase pi has now been connected with peroxiredoxin - 6 for its recovery of peroxidase activity ( Zhou et al . , 2013 ) . Acute temporary as well as persistent overexpression of GSH S - transferase pi was observed during renal carcinogen - esis induced by Fe - NTA ( Fukuda et al . , 1996a ; Tanaka et al . , 1998 ) . Nrf2 and Keap1 are now recognized as a master regulatory transcription system for antioxidant enzymes ( GSH synthesis , hydrogen peroxide removal , detoxiﬁcation , drug excretion , and NADPH synthesis ) ( Suzuki et al . , 2013 ) . Under normal condi - tions , Nrf2 is constitutively produced but is inactivated in the cytoplasm following its interaction with Keap1 by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation . Keap1 is indeed a sensor molecule for oxidative stress . The multiple cysteine residues on Keap1 , which are ultrasensitive to electrophiles , are critically important for the binding with Nrf2 ( Itoh et al . , 1997 , 1999 ; Mitsuishi et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 8 ) . With the aid of next generation sequencing , it has become clear that Nrf2 is consistently activated in certain cancers with various mutations . Mutually exclusive Nrf2 mutations or Keap1 mutations are observed in cancers for Nrf2 to be localized in the FIGURE 8 | Regulation of Nrf2 transcription machinery through oxidative stress sensor , Keap1 , with numerous redox - reactive cysteine residues . nucleus ( Mitsuishi et al . , 2012 ) . Sulﬁredoxin is also under the transcriptional regulation of Nrf2 ( Jeong et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , can - cer cells have hijacked this system , making them consistently more resistant to oxidative stress ( Figure 7 ) . Recently , peroxiredoxin 1 , 4 , and 6 were shown either to enhance tumor progression or to promote metastasis ( Ishii et al . , 2012 ) . CANCER STEM CELLS AND THIOL METABOLISM Stem cells are deﬁned as undifferentiated immature cells that , upon certain stimuli or signaling , differentiate into a planned type of mature cell ( s ) . Cancer stem cells represent a distinct sub - set , namely , cells that have acquired all the necessary genetic and epigenetic alterations but are usually quiescent and divide only if necessary ( Holland et al . , 2013 ) . This feature is in con - trast to the cancer tissue as a whole , which is exposed to per - sistent oxidative stress ( Toyokuni et al . , 1995b ) . In this sense , cancer stem cells constitute small heavenly territories in cancer tissue . In transplant experiments , theoretically , even a single can - cer stem cell can generate a large tumor . Thus , the existence of cancer stem cells has been used to explain chemotherapy - resistance in such a dormant state . These cancer stem cells are more resistant than non - stem cancer cells to cytotoxic chemicals . Recently , Hideyuki Saya’s group reported that cancer stem cells in certain cancers present CD44 variant 8 - 10 ( CD44v ) isoform on the plasma membrane , which stabilizes the cys - tine / glutamate transporter ( antiporter ; xCT ) , leading to increased GSH ( Ishimoto et al . , 2011 ) . This may at least partially explain the robustness of cancer cell defenses against oxida - tive stress , including those involved in chemotherapy - resistance . There is already an xCT antagonist , sulfasalazine , and clini - cal trials are underway in advanced gastric cancer in Japan ( Figure 9A ) . Frontiers in Pharmacology | Experimental Pharmacology and Drug Discovery August 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 200 | 6 Toyokuni Iron and thiol compounds in carcinogenesis FERROPTOSIS Recently , a different type of cell death other than necrosis , apop - tosis , or autophagy was reported in cancer cells . The oncogenic RAS - selective lethal small molecule erastin triggers a unique iron - dependent form of non - apoptotic cell death called ferroptosis ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ) . Similar to glutamate , erastin inhibits cys - tine uptake by the cystine / glutamate antiporter , inducing a void FIGURE 9 | Key role of the cystine / glutamate antiporter in cancer cells . ( A ) Overexpression of CD44v ( 8 - 11 ) stabilizes the cystine / glutamate antiporter to increase cysteine and glutathione ( GSH ) in cancer stem cells . ( B ) Conversely , erastin blocks the cystine / glutamate antiporter , lowers cysteine and ﬁnally induces iron - dependent cancer cell death ( ferroptosis ) , which can be blocked with deferoxamine ( DFO ) . of antioxidant defenses , resulting in iron - dependent oxidative stress . Interestingly , this type of cell death is inhibited by an iron chelator , deferoxamine , which removes cellular iron ( Figure 9B ) . Deferoxamine functions in clear contrast to NTA in that it blocks all 6 ligands of iron ( Toyokuni and Sagripanti , 1992 ) . The authors suggest that one of more yet unidentiﬁed iron - dependent enzymes are functioning as a core lethal mechanism for ferroptosis ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ) . FUTURE CANCER PREVENTION AND CANCER THERAPEUTICS It is generally accepted that chronic oxidative stress via excess iron leads to carcinogenesis , presumably through hydroxyl rad - icals , and that most of the defense system is associated with thiol compounds whereas iron and thiol compounds are apparently essential elements . These two are antagonistic in abundance , and their characteristics are distinct ( Table 3 ) . For cancer prevention , we recognize that cancers of differ - ent tissues are completely different diseases . Speciﬁc risks are present for each type of cancer , and we have to decrease spe - ciﬁc risks as early as possible in our lives . For example , asbestos is a deﬁnite carcinogen , causing malignant mesothelioma , and smoking increases the risk of more than 20 different cancers , including laryngeal and lung cancers ( Toyokuni , 2013a ) . Today we demand practical methods for prevention of overall can - cer . Antioxidant systems , if deﬁcient , have to be supplemented . Table 3 | Antagonizing roles of iron and thiols .

Excessive supplementation with β - carotene even increased the risk of lung cancer in smok - ers ( Albanes et al . , 1996 ) . Here appropriate iron reduction via blood donation or phlebotomy may be a potential method of cancer prevention . Among the three components of iron , oxy - gen , and thiol compounds , we can modify only iron status after all . Humans live much longer than they did 70 years ago , fol - lowing the conquest of major infectious diseases . After reaching middle age , iron is found in excess , especially in men of well - developed countries , because there is no other way to excrete iron ( Toyokuni , 2011a ) . This theory requires further epidemiological studies and clinical trials for demonstration . Reportedly , cancer may hijack cytokine systems ( e . g . , SMAD4 ) via mutation to col - lect iron for proliferation ( Wang et al . , 2005 ) . Notably , there is an opposing report that iron deﬁciency accelerates Helicobacter pylori - induced carcinogenesis in rodents and humans ( Noto et al . , 2013 ) . Iron deﬁciency appears to enhance the virulence of Helicobacter pylori , which deﬁnitely requires iron to live . This fact needs to be further discussed . Iron deﬁciency should be avoided because it causes anemia ( hemoglobin ) and muscle weakness ( myoglobin ) . Currently , antibody therapies ( Scott et al . , 2012 ) and small - molecular - weight kinase inhibitors ( Fabbro et al . , 2012 ) are pop - ular and work well as individualized therapies for speciﬁc cancers . However , the drawbacks of these therapies include the acquisition of resistance and high medical costs . As an alternative approach , some scientists are already thinking of attacking the Achilles’ heel of cancer . As foreseen from the presence of ferroptosis , cancers in general accumulate iron for proliferation , which may allow the abundance of catalytic iron in the cytoplasm . Indeed , hydrogen peroxide is not the only molecule to induce the Fenton reaction . Ascorbate ( vitamin C ) and L - cysteine as reducing agents can also initiate the Fenton reaction in the presence of catalytic Fe ( III ) ( Toyokuni and Sagripanti , 1996 ) . In light of this , high - dose ascor - bate therapy is being tested in a clinical trial with a standard regimen of chemotherapy because ascorbate has long been proven to be a safe drug in humans ( Welsh et al . , 2013 ) . EPILOG Iron and sulfur are essential for life despite their presence in small amounts . Excessive iron cause oxidative damage in the genome , which can be a basis of somatic mutational evolution in search of resistance against oxidative stress and cellular proliferation . Apparently , iron and thiol compounds are antagonistic toward oxidative stress , but even thiol compounds can be our foes in cancer . Therefore , it is difﬁcult to conclude the role of iron and thiol compounds as friends or foes , which depends on the quan - tity / distribution and induction / ﬂexibility , respectively . Avoiding further mutation would be the most helpful strategy for cancer prevention , and myriad of efforts are being made to sort out the weaknesses of cancer cells .
