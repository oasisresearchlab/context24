Review Beyond bilobal : Transferrin homologs having unusual domain architectures ☆ Jean P . Gaffney , Ann M . Valentine ⁎ Department of Chemistry , Yale University , USA a b s t r a c t a r t i c l e i n f o Article history : Received 3 June 2011 Received in revised form 2 September 2011 Accepted 24 September 2011 Available online 2 October 2011 Keywords : Transferrin Monolobal Bilobal Trilobal Gene duplication Background : Most transferrin family proteins have a familiar bilobal structure , the result of an ancient gene duplication , with an iron binding site in each of two homologous lobes . Scattered throughout the evolutionary tree from algae to mammals , though , are transferrin homologs having other kinds of domain architectures . Scope of review : This review covers a variety of unusual transferrin forms , including monolobals , bilobals with one or both iron - binding sites abrogated , bilobals accessorized with long insertions or with membrane anchors , and even trilobals . The monolobal transferrin homologs from marine invertebrate ascidians are especially highlighted here . Major conclusions : Unusual transferrin homologs appear scattered through much of the evolutionary tree . For some of these proteins , iron binding and / or iron transport appearto bethe primary roles ; for othersthey clearly are not . Many are incompletely or not at all studied . Generalsigni ﬁ cance : Taken together , theseproteins begin to offer a glimpse intohow thetransferrinarchitecture has been repurposed for a diversity of applications .

Gene duplication in bilobal transferrin proteins The majority of transferrin ( Tf ) family proteins , particularly the fa - miliarvertebrate transferrinssuchasserumtransferrin ( sTf ) , lactoferrin ( lTf ) , and ovotransferrin ( oTf ) , are soluble , iron - binding , monomeric bilobal proteins of approximately 80 kDa having striking homology be - tween the N - and C - terminal halves of the protein ( Fig . 1 ) [ 1 ] . The homology usually includes metal ion binding residues in each lobe ( 2 Tyr , 1 His , and 1 Asp ) , conserved patterns of disul ﬁ de bonds , and other functionally important residues ( e . g . an Arg important for synergistic anion binding ) . This homology suggests an evolutionary origin by gene duplication of a ~ 40 kDa monolobal form [ 2 – 5 ] . Metal ion ( usually Fe 3 + ) binding typically results in conformational change wherein the lobes close ( Fig . 2 ) . The driving force for gene duplication to produce this bilobal structure has been contemplated since its discovery . One early idea held that a bilobal architecture may be necessary for organisms with a ﬁ ltration kidney [ 2 ] , because a small protein would be ﬁ ltered from circulation too quickly . This theory implied that organisms that do not have a kidney could have a monolobal transferrin . More re - cently , structures of the cell - surface transferrin receptor ( TfR ) and studies on its complex with iron - bound transferrin have highlighted features in both lobes of transferrin that are important for receptor in - teraction [ 6 ] . Two lobes may thus be necessary for ef ﬁ cient receptor - mediated endocytosis of sTf . Though the familiar form is bilobal , there are numerous transferrin - related proteins that have other kinds of domain architectures . Lambert et al . covered manyoftheseproteinsinanexcellentanalysis of transfer - rinevolution [ 4 ] . Manyof theseproteinsoccuramongthe invertebrates , although they are found from algae up to mammals , and many are relatively little studied . Some may be descended from monolobal forms before gene duplication , or may result from further duplications or modi ﬁ cations of a bilobal form . Besides the bacterial ferric binding proteins , which are similar to classical Tfs in overall lobed structure and in function but not in primary sequence ( see below ) , proteins are considered Tf homologs here that have signi ﬁ cant sequence homology to the classical Tfs , usually including the evolutionarily conserved disul - ﬁ de and iron - and anion - binding residues . For many of these proteins , demonstrations are still lacking that they are transferrins in function ( in the sense of having a physiological iron binding and / or transport role ) as well as in sequence . In some proteins the Tf scaffold may be repurposed to carry out new functions . 2 . Other domain architectures 2 . 1 . Bacterial Fbp proteins and other periplasmic binding proteins Much farther down the evolutionary ladder , the very distant rela - tives of transferrins are monolobal .

This protein family binds a variety of cargo including metal ions and anions . Although their overall topology is similar , there is no signi ﬁ cant primary sequence homology with the Tfs . The common iron binding ability of Fbp and the classical Tfs has apparently evolved convergently , and different amino acid side chains coming from different regions of the protein bind iron , though iron binding is in the Fbps is similarly anion - dependent . 2 . 2 . Monolobal transferrins : false leads The search for an extant monolobal Tf with homology to the clas - sical bilobal ones ( Fig . 3B ) featured several false leads . A 1971 report found , byusing 59 Felabelingofhag ﬁ shserum , severalapparentvariants of Tf , includinga 44 kDproteinthatboundoneironaswell asan ~ 85 kD form [ 10 ] . The work was refuted in a paper that reported only a single iron - binding protein in hag ﬁ sh serum , of molecular weight 75 – 80 kD ; it had two iron - binding sites with similar UV / vis and EPR spectra to those in human sTf and appeared to be a normal bilobal Tf [ 11 ] . The pending sequencing of the hag ﬁ sh genome ( http : / / www . genome . gov / 10002154 ) will help to resolve this discrepancy . A 1991 report of a monolobal transferrin ( “ hemiferrin ” ) from rat [ 12 ] turned out to be erroneous [ 13 ] . In that work , a 0 . 9 kb mRNA transcript with sequence similar but not identical to the 3 ′ end of rat transferrin was detected in rat testis germ cells [ 12 ] . The transcript predicted an ~ 24 kD protein . A 2002 report provided evidence that the transcript was not a unique sequence but was instead a truncation of the rat transferrin message , and that negligible protein was made from this transcript [ 13 ] . The public genome database for the rat , se - quenced in 2004 [ 14 ] , still includes the original hemiferrin sequence ( NCBI reference sequence NP _ 775443 . 1 ) , though it was not located in two current genome assemblies . 2 . 3 . Monolobal transferrins 2 . 3 . 1 . Monolobals in ascidians A new candidate for a monolobal Tf protein was reported in 1984 , isolated from the blood plasma of the ascidian Pyura stolonifera [ 15 ] . Ascidians ( sometimes called sea squirts ) are invertebrate chordates that fall close to the evolutionary boundary between invertebrates and vertebrates . That evolutionary placement , coupled with their un - usual proclivity for metal ion sequestration [ 16 ] , made these organisms an intriguing place to look for novel metal binding proteins . The P . sto - lonifera isolated protein had a molecular weight of 41 kDa and bound 1 mol Fe / mol protein with bicarbonate as an obligate synergistic anion . Whereas the Tyr - to - Fe ( III ) charge transfers of classical iron - bound Tfs occur at 465 nm , the apparent analogous charge transfer in the as - isolated iron - bound P . stolonifera protein occurred at 429 nm , and appeared as a shoulder on the higher - energy protein absorption . The protein delivered 59 Fe into rat reticulocytes , and adding increasing amounts of human diferric sTf decreased the amount of iron uptake , suggesting that the biolobal Tf competed with the monolobal for bind - ing to the cell surface TfR . While this result was encouraging and sug - gested that the 41 kDa protein might be a functional transferrin , the fact that the paper used human sTf with rat cells ( and thus the rat TfR ) raised some questions . It is dif ﬁ cult to predict whether and how tightly a speci ﬁ c iron - bound Tf will bind to the TfR from a different or - ganism . For example , bovine Tf does not interact strongly with the humanTfR [ 17 ] , despite highhomologybetweenthehumanandbovine Tfproteins . Also , theindividuallobesof humansTf donot bind tightly to the human TfR [ 6 ] , so it is somewhat surprising that any monolobal Tf , much less one from a different organism , would bind strongly to the rat TfR . To demonstrate more clearly an iron transport role with rat cells , rat sTf and the 41 kDa protein might be individually radiolabeled with 125 I ( to label the protein ) and 59 Fe and then compared directly to see whether protein and / or iron were internalized into thecells . In such an experiment , addition of the unlabeled rat Tf would serve as an im - portant control for nonspeci ﬁ c binding . Another ascidian species , Halocynthia roretzi ( Fig . 4A ) , yielded a second ascidian monolobal transferrin in 2001 [ 18 ] . The 52 kDa pro - tein bound 1 equivalent of iron . Its sequence was determined by pro - teolytic degradation and Edman sequencing , and using that information , a cDNA clone was isolated that encoded a 372 amino acid protein ( including a 21 amino acid N - terminal signal sequence ) . Full sequencing revealed that the protein was ~ 35 % homologous with either the N - or C - lobe of human sTf and included all of the putative iron - binding amino acids in the same sequence context , as well as disul ﬁ de - forming cysteines and other signi ﬁ cant residues . The calcu - lated molecular weight for that protein from its deduced sequence ( 39 . 5 kDa ) suggested that the mature protein was probably glycosylated . The availability of a full ascidian genome sequence in 2002 , that from Ciona intestinalis , afforded a further chance to study ascidian transferrins [ 19 ] . Analysis of that sequence revealed genes for two Tfs [ 20 ] , one monolobal and similar in sequence to the H . roretzi trans - ferrin , and one bilobal but having an apparent N - terminal membrane anchor ( see below ) . Biochemical studies of the monolobal Tf , called nicatransferrin ( nicaTf ) , isolated from the blood plasma of the native organism revealed similarities but also important differences be - tween nicaTf and classical bilobal Tfs [ 20 ] . Like the H . roretzi monolo - bal transferrin and sTf , nicaTf had an N - terminal signal sequence ; the predicted mature protein was 35 . 0 kDa . The as - isolated protein was 37 . 7 kDa , apparently due to glycosylation . It bound one equivalent of iron in an anion - dependent manner , but iron binding was not ac - companied by the UV / vis changes ( particularly the ~ 465 nm charge transfer ) common for the classical Tfs . Notably , the UV / vis spectrum of the iron - bound form was similar to that for the P . stolonifera pro - tein ( see above ) . The nicaTf protein had a chromophore at ~ 325 nm , regardless of iron status , that appeared as a shoulder on the higher - energy protein absorption . These ﬁ ndings were recapitulated and further expanded by using the nicaTf heterologously expressed in yeast [ 21 – 23 ] . These biochemi - cal studies identi ﬁ ed further differences between nicaTf and the classi - cal Tfs . Not just the UV / vis but also the EPR spectra of the iron - bound forms of these proteins were distinct from those of classical Tfs [ 21 , 23 ] . Despite the presence of the same apparent metal - binding amino acids , binding of iron was several orders of magnitude weaker to nicaTf than to hsTf [ 24 ] . There is so far no evidence for the dramatic Fig . 1 . Bilobal structure of human serum transferrin , a classical bilobal transferrin .

P . Gaffney , A . M . Valentine / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1820 ( 2012 ) 212 – 217 conformational change upon iron binding observed for sTf ( Fig . 2 ) . Vanadate ( VO 3 − ) bound with similar strength to both nicaTf and hsTf [ 22 ] , but no synergistic anion was required for binding to human sTf whereas it was for nicaTf . Taken together , the evidence suggested that metal ions did not bind to nicaTf via deprotonated conserved Tyr residues , but in some other manner . There is currently no structure available for the nicaTf protein . Based on the strong homology with sTf , however , a structure can be modeled on the apo - form of the N - lobe of human sTf [ 25 ] as a tem - plate by using the I - TASSER server [ 26 – 28 ] ( Fig . 5 ) . An apo form was chosen as the model because of the lack of evidence that iron binds in the same way , or causes the same conformational changes , in nicaTf as it does in classical Tfs . Alignments [ 20 ] reveal several de - letions ( red in Fig . 5 ) with respect to human sTf that shorten loops and helices in the both upper and lower sub - lobes , as well as several fairly long insertions ( green in Fig . 5 ) , including insertions of 7 and 9 amino acids in the bottom part of the lobe . The evolutionarily con - served disul ﬁ de bonds ( not shown ) are predicted to remain intact , and the residues homologous to the iron - binding residues in sTf ( pur - ple in Fig . 5 ) point generally toward the open cleft ; it is unclear from this model why they would not bind iron in the same way . Adding to the mystery about the physiological role of nicaTf , and monolobal Tfs in ascidians more generally , is the fact that , in the ge - nome sequence of Ciona intestinalis [ 19 ] , there appears to be no obvious TfR [ 20 , 29 ] . WhatrolethenicaTfproteinmightplay , intheabsenceofan apparent receptor , remains an open question . 2 . 3 . 2 . Otolith matrix protein OMP - 1 In 2005 , a 55 kDa glycoprotein named otolith matrix protein ( OMP - 1 ) was isolated from the biomineralized inner ear of some ﬁ sh [ 30 ] . Its 344 amino acid encoded sequence follows a 23 amino acid signal peptide . It features 40 % overall homology with the C lobe of human melanotransferrin ( mTf ) ( see below ) and has the pattern of cysteine residues consistent with a transferrin , though of the ca - nonical iron - binding residues , His has been replaced with Asn . OMP - 1 is required for normal growth of the otolith [ 31 ] , but no spe - ci ﬁ c role for metal binding has been reported . 2 . 4 . “ Deactivated ” bilobals Though still technically bilobal in structure , some transferrins have apparently lost the ability to bind iron in one or both of the two lobes ( Fig . 3D ) . Among the insects , most Tfs are classic bilobal proteins , with two functional lobes , but some insect Tfs like the one from the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta ( Fig . 4B ) do not have the ability to bind Fe ( III ) in one of the lobes due to mutations in the metal - binding residues [ 4 ] . Other insect transferrins are similarly deactivated , including the ones occurring in Drosophila , the mosquito Aedes aegypti , and the honeybee Apis mellifera [ 4 ] . The mosquito transferrin was isolated because it is up - regulated in response to in - fection ; an interesting proposal is that it sequesters iron in an antibac - terial role while evading the transferrin receptors of the pathogen [ 32 ] . Melanotransferrin ( mTf , also called p97 ) is a bilobal protein origi - nally identi ﬁ ed as a 97 kDa protein on the surface of melanoma cells in mammals , though it was later shown to exist also in soluble form [ 33 , 34 ] . Iron binding is abolished in the C - terminal lobe because of mutations to the iron - binding residues [ 33 , 35 ] , and its true role is still being elucidated . The mouse Inhibitor of Carbonic Anhydrase ( ICA ) protein has mu - tations in both lobes that render it unable to bind iron in either lobe [ 36 ] : Trp for the synergistic anion - binding Arg and Ser for one of the iron - binding Tyr residues in the N lobe , and Thr for Arg , Ser for Tyr , and Arg for the iron - binding His in the C lobe . The physiological role for ICA is not iron binding ; instead , it is an enzyme inhibitor . Sur - prisingly , a recent X - ray crystal structure of ICA revealed that both lobes are in the closed conformation even though iron is not bound [ 37 ] . 2 . 5 . Bilobal with bonuses : inserts into “ normal ” bilobal Tfs Several transferrin family relatives are nominally bilobal , but have insertions in the normal bilobal transferrin architecture . The transferrin homolog saxiphilin from Rana catesbiana ( bull - frog ) does not bind iron due to a 144 residue insertion in the N lobe and many amino acid substitutions in the C lobe . The N lobe insertion consists of two homologous thyropin domains which inhibit cysteine proteases such as papain and cathepsins [ 38 ] . Rather than ful ﬁ lling an iron binding role , it binds saxitoxin , a neurotoxin produced by dino - ﬂ agellates and cyanobacteria [ 39 ] . The ~ 180 kDa major yolk proteins ( MYPs ) and the very similar toposomes are found among sea urchins [ 40 , 41 ] ( Fig . 3C ) . There are differences in sequence between the MYPs and the toposomes includ - ing a Cys knot region in the toposomes but not MYPs . Those from sea urchins Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ( Fig . 4D ) and Lytechinus variega - tus [ 40 ] , for example , were originally classi ﬁ ed as vitellogenins having a nutritive role . The primary structure of the MYPs , though , revealed them to include a transferrin - like sequence with extensions at both the N - ( ~ 130 amino acid ) and C - ( ~ 240 amino acid ) termini as well as a long ( ~ 280 amino acid ) insertion in the middle of the C lobe ( green spheres 1 , 3 , and 2 , respectively , in Fig . 3C ) . Some MYPs / toposomes werereportedtobind iron [ 40 ] . The protein wasindependentlyisolated in an investigation of cell adhesion in the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla [ 41 ] . In that work , MYP / toposome was characterized as a Ca 2 + binding adhesive protein that did not bind Fe 3 + and that assembled into a hex - americ glycoprotein when mature . It was noted that MYPs / toposomes lack most of the classical Tf iron binding residues [ 41 ] . In the aggregate , suggested functions for MYPs / toposomes include roles in Fe 3 + or Zn 2 + delivery , bacteriostasis ( via Fe 3 + binding ) , cell adhesion , or provision of an amino acid reserve in a nutritive role .

In thisstructure , insertions withrespect to human sTf are in green , regions of deletions are in red , and the residues homologous to the human sTf iron binding residues are in purple . The ﬁ gure was rendered by using MacPyMOL . 215 J . P . Gaffney , A . M . Valentine / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1820 ( 2012 ) 212 – 217 Another accessorized Tf - like protein ( BbT ﬂ ) was identi ﬁ ed in the amphioxus ( lancelet ) protochordate Branchiostoma belcheri [ 42 ] by large scale sequencing of a gut cDNA library . Its primary sequence was similar to that of the MYPs / toposomes and featured a 305 amino acid insertion in the C lobe . The N - terminal extension observed for the MYPs / toposomes was not present , and the C - terminal se - quence was not highly homologous to the MYPs / toposomes . The BbT ﬂ protein bound iron , though like the MYPs / toposomes , most of the classical Tf canonical iron binding ligands were not conserved . The BbT ﬂ protein inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria and was upregulated in response to exposure to bacteria , leading to a pos - tulated role in immune defense . The full genome sequence is available for a related species , Branchiostoma ﬂ oridae [ 43 ] , and a BLAST search identi ﬁ es a BbT ﬂ homolog as well as four other hypothetical transfer - rin family proteins , of apparent length between ~ 270 ( which would be even shorter than the ascidian monolobal Tfs ) and ~ 3600 amino acids . The latter , which has not been experimentally veri ﬁ ed , is pre - dicted to incorporate six full transferrin domains . 2 . 6 . Trilobals Some apparent Tf - family members have gone beyond bilobal and exhibit three transferrin lobes ( Fig . 3F ) in their primary structure . 2 . 6 . 1 . Triplicated transferrins in algae A 150 kDa trilobal or triplicated Tf ( Ttf , also called p150 ) was iden - ti ﬁ ed in the salt - tolerant marine green algae Dunaliella salina [ 44 – 46 ] , which also has a gene for a bilobal transferrin [ 4 ] . The salt - induced and iron - limitation - induced plasma membrane Ttf protein is so far the only Tf homolog found in a photosynthetic organism . It features the three Tf lobes with conserved disul ﬁ des and some substitutions in the canonical iron - and synergistic anion - binding residues , as well as a ~ 100 amino acid C - terminal extension [ 44 ] . Of the three lobes , the ﬁ rst two ( designated α 1 and α 2 ) are 64 % identical to one another , while the third ( β ) is 28 % identical to either of the α sub - units [ 44 ] . It is possible the Ttf is responsible for iron uptake without receptor - mediated endocytosis under high salt concentrations [ 45 ] . 2 . 6 . 2 . Pacifastin Pacifastin is a protease inhibitor produced by the cray ﬁ sh Pacifas - tacus leniusculus ( Fig . 4C ) [ 47 ] . The 155 kDa heterodimer comprises a light chain of 44 kDa that is the actual inhibitory subunit as well as a heavy chain of 105 kDa that features three Tf lobes , designated paci - fastin heavy chain lobes ( PHLs ) . In contrast to the interlobe homology of the algal Ttf , PHL1 and PHL3 are most similar to the classical Tf N - lobe , while PHL2 is most similar to the classical Tf C - lobe . Of the ﬁ ve canonical iron - and synergistic anion - binding amino acids , four are conserved in PHL2 ( Asp , 2 Tyr , and His ) and PHL3 ( Arg , 2 Tyr , and His ) , but just one ( a Tyr ) is conserved in PHL1 . The isolated protein had 1 . 35 equivalents of iron per protein , consistent with a model in which two of the Tf lobes bound iron . The light chain of pacifastin was identi ﬁ ed in N 55 species within arthropods and related phyla [ 48 ] , but it is not clear which of these also have the trilobal Tf heavy domain . It is also not clear whether or how a 150 kDa putative trans - ferrin reported in 1982 from the crab Cancer magister [ 49 ] may be re - lated to pacifastin . No sequence data are available for that protein , nor genome data for that organism . 2 . 7 . Augmentation for membrane association Most Tfs are soluble proteins , but several transferrin homologs are membrane anchored , or contain apparent membrane - anchoring se - quences , but the details differ dramatically . The membrane - anchored form of mTf ( see above ) has a glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) tail at the C - terminus that attaches it to the cell surface [ 33 , 34 ] . The C . intestinalis bilobal transferrin has not yet been isolated , but its primary sequence uniquely suggests a transmembrane sequence that could be a protein anchor at the N - terminal end [ 20 ] . It has been suggested that this membrane anchor could allow for iron up - take in the absence of a transferrin receptor ( which Ciona apparently lacks [ 29 ] ) , if that membrane - anchored protein were to bind iron and deliver it directly to the cell [ 20 ] . Finally , the trilobal Ttf in algae is plasma membrane - associated [ 44 ] ; this localization may be due to the C - terminal extension . It may be involved in endocytosis - independent iron transport , which might be particularly important under limitations on iron availability at high salt concentrations [ 44 – 46 ] . 3 . Conclusions There are many different examples of domain architectures among transferrin homologs beyond the familiar , bilobal , two - iron - binding motif ( Table 1 ) . These proteins appear sporadically over the evolutionary tree of life from algae to mammals , but there are some particularly interesting examples among the higher invertebrates like arthropods and ascidians . Often , the physiological role of these proteins is something other than iron binding and transport . The availability of additional genomes , particularly among the higher in - vertebrates , may be revealing about the occurrence and evolution of these nonclassical transferrins .
