Hope * Department of Cell and Molecular Biology , Feinberg School of Medicine , Northwestern University , Chicago , Illinois , United States of America Abstract CCR5 acts as the principal coreceptor during HIV - 1 transmission and early stages of infection . Efficient HIV - 1 entry requires a series of processes , many dependent on the conformational state of both viral envelope protein and cellular receptor . Monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) are able to identify different CCR5 conformations , allowing for their use as probes to distinguish CCR5 populations . Not all CCR5 MAbs are able to reduce HIV - 1 infection , suggesting the use of select CCR5 populations for entry . In the U87 . CD4 . CCR5 - GFP cell line , we used such HIV - 1 - restricting MAbs to probe the relation between localization , trafficking and G protein association for individual CCR5 conformations . We find that CCR5 conformations not only exhibit different localization and abundance patterns throughout the cell , but that they also display distinct sensitivities to endocytosis inhibition . Using chemokine analogs that vary in their HIV - 1 inhibitory mechanisms , we also illustrate that responses to ligand engagement are conformation - specific . Additionally , we provide supporting evidence for the select sensitivity of conformations to G protein association . Characterizing the link between the function and dynamics of CCR5 populations has implications for understanding their selective targeting by HIV - 1 and for the development of inhibitors that will block CCR5 utilization by the virus .

The significance of CCR5 is highlighted by the fact that persons homozygous for a 32 - base pair deletion ( D 32 ) within CCR5 harbor a truncated receptor that leads to resistance to HIV - 1 acquisition [ 1 , 2 ] . In its normal role , CCR5 functions in immune cell regulation by mediating lymphocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation [ 3 , 4 ] . The immune function of CCR5 and increased susceptibility of D 32 persons to West Nile virus highlights the importance of CCR5 , suggesting that it is not completely dispensable without effect [ 5 , 6 ] . Consequently , much emphasis has been placed on inhibiting HIV - 1 utilization of surface CCR5 through the development of several CCR5 antagonists [ 7 – 9 ] . One such antagonist is Maraviroc ( MVC ) , a CCR5 inhibitor approved for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection , which blocks receptor activation without masking the binding sites for chemokines and the HIV envelope glycoprotein [ 7 , 10 , 11 ] . In contrast , CCR5 chemokines Macrophage Inflammatory Protein - 1 a ( MIP - 1 a ) , MIP - 1 b , Monocyte chemotactic protein ( MCP ) - 2 and RANTES naturally restrict HIV - 1 infection by masking virus binding sites and promoting CCR5 cell surface down - modulation [ 12 , 13 ] . Several groups have exploited the natural chemokine mechanisms of restriction by modifying the N - terminus of RANTES to produce CCR5 small - molecule inhibitors . Such RANTES analogs have different effects on CCR5 internalization and signaling , and have also been demonstrated to be potent HIV - 1 inhibitors [ 14 – 18 ] . CCR5 activation occurs upon ligand binding and subsequent exchange of GTP for GDP in the receptor - bound G a subunit of the G i a class of heterotrimeric G proteins , a pertussis toxin - sensitive process [ 19 ] . Receptor activation precedes a multi - step desensitization process leading to b - arrestin binding and to receptor uncoupling from the G protein [ 20 , 21 ] . Phosphorylated serine residues on the CCR5 cytoplasmic tail serve as a binding site for b - arrestin , an adaptor protein involved in the translocation of receptors from the cell surface to internal compartments via clathrin - meditated endocytosis [ 22 , 23 ] . The route of CCR5 trafficking has been well characterized . After chemokine engage - ment , the receptor is internalized and travels to the endosomal recycling compartment ( ERC ) , from the ERC to the trans Golgi network ( TGN ) , and then back to the plasma membrane [ 24 – 26 ] . Ligand binding to GPCRs can achieve varying efficacy for downstream signaling depending on the conformation state of the receptor [ 27 , 28 ] . The existence of distinct CCR5 conformations is seen through discordant binding levels of ligands and antibody affinities of CCR5 specific monoclonal antibodies ( MAbs ) [ 29 – 31 ] . A recent report has characterized CCR5 receptor populations by illustrating their differential engagement based on having high or low affinity for chemokines [ 32 ] . On the one hand , competitive CCR5 binding experiments revealed that native chemokines bound with low affinity to gp120 - binding receptors , an explana - tion for why such chemokines exhibit weak inhibition of HIV . On the other hand , chemokine analogs bound with high affinity to the PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 February 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 2 | e89056 same receptors [ 32 ] . Additionally , coupling assays revealed that gp120 binds indiscriminately to NF G protein - coupled and - uncoupled receptors [ 32 ] . Other data highlights the selective usage of CCR5 conformations by HIV with the observation that only a subset of MAbs restricts infection [ 31 ] . Much is known about CCR5 trafficking and the identity of CCR5 conformational heterogeneity , but it is not clear if the normal cycling of the receptor influences CCR5 conformations . Additionally , it is not known if the CCR5 conformation state is static or readily altered . Former studies have demonstrated the HIV - 1 - restricting and gp120 - antagonizing effect of MAbs 2D7 , 45531 , PA11 and MC - 5 [ 29 – 31 ] . Using these MAbs as probes to detect CCR5 conformations , we investigated whether a distinction exists between conformations and their localization , trafficking , ligand engagement and G protein association . We observe that CCR5 populations vary in their abundance and spatial distribu - tion throughout the cell when aspects of normal function are modulated . We find that conformations display distinct sensitivities to endocytosis inhibition . Furthermore , RANTES analogs differ - entially alter surface and internal levels of CCR5 conformations . Distinguishing CCR5 conformational heterogeneity relative to receptor functions has implications for understanding their selective use by HIV - 1 and the development of improved strategies to block CCR5 use by HIV - 1 . Materials and Methods Antibodies CCR5 MAbs 2D7 and 45531 were purchased from R & D Systems ( Minneapolis , MN , USA ) and BD Pharmingen ( San Jose , California , USA ) respectively . MC - 5 monoclonal CCR5 antibody was a gift from Matthias Mack at the University of Regensburg in Germany . Separate stocks of PA11 were received from John Moore at Cornell University . TRITC secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch ( West Grove , PA , USA ) . Cells and reagents The following reagent was obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program , Division of AIDS , NIAID , NIH : U87 . CD4 from Dr . HongKui Deng and Dr . Dan R . Littman . CCR5 - GFP was stably expressed in U87 . CD4 cells using a lentivirus - based strategy . Briefly , packaging plasmid D NRF , retroviral vector pBABE . CCR5 - GFP and VSV - G were cotransfected into 293T cells . After 48 hours , supernatants were harvested and used to transduce U87 . CD4 cells . The polyclonal population was sorted by FACS for a low - expressing GFP cell population . The CCR5 - GFP fusion product was found to remain intact after protein synthesis ( Figure S1 ) . U87 . CD4 . CCR5 - GFP cells were maintained in DMEM ( Cellgro , Manassass , VA USA ) with 10 % FBS and 2 m g / mL puromycin ( InvivoGen , San Diego , California , USA ) . The puromycin concentration was based on previous cytotoxicity assays . 293 - Affinofile cells were maintained in DMEM supple - mented with 10 % FBS and 50 m g / mL Blasticidin S HCl ( Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY ) . To induce CCR5 expression , 293 - Affinofile cells were treated with either 0 . 25 m M or 1 . 0 m M Ponasterone ( Invitrogen ) for 24 hours prior to experimental setup . Chlorpromazine ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO , USA ) and sucrose ( VWR , Radnor , PA , USA ) were dissolved in distilled water . Dynasore ( Enzo Life Sciences , Farmingdale , NY , USA ) and Nystatin ( Sigma ) were dissolved in DMSO . Immunofluorescence staining Cells were plated on 12 mm glass cover slips and allowed to adhere overnight . Surface staining - Live cells were temperature - shifted from 37 u C to 4 u C to reduce lipid bilayer mobility and prevent receptor internalization . Cells were then treated with block containing 5 % Normal Donkey Serum in 1X PBS for 20 min at 4 u C to block non - specific Ab binding sites . Cells were surface stained with unconjugated CCR5 MAbs for 1 hr at 4 u C , then washed . Cells were subsequently incubated with a TRITC - labeled secondary antibody at 4 u C for 30 min at a concentration yielding maximal fluorescence for all MAbs and background fluorescence in the absence of MAb . MAb concentrations were titrated in U87 . CD4 cells lacking CCR5 and chosen based on the highest concentration that exhibited a fluorescent intensity comparable to background . After antibody staining , cells were incubated with Hoechst for visualization of nuclei . Total staining - Cells were stained similarly to the above protocol , with the addition of Triton X - 100 at 0 . 1 % in the blocking buffer . Staining was also performed at room temperature . Image capture Images were collected in a z - series , 0 . 2 m M apart , on a DeltaVision ( Applied Precision ) microscope . Following acquisition , images were deconvolved using softWoRx ( Applied Precision ) deconvolution software . For each condition , at least 30 images were captured at 100 6 magnification . Image quantification To quantify overlap of fluorophores , an Interactive Data Language ( IDL ) program was developed and used for all images . The CCR5 - GFP threshold was set above the non - specific signal from GFP - negative cells to neglect background voxels ( volumetric pixels ) and emphasize internal regions and membrane structures . The GFP - positive voxels were analyzed for overlap with TRITC - labeled secondary antibodies . For each condition , one image was chosen to establish TRITC brightness thresholds . The threshold in the TRITC channel was set above secondary - only background . After establishing thresholds , the IDL program calculated the percentage overlap of the voxels above both thresholds on a per image basis . The program applies the same threshold values to all images from the same condition thus avoiding user bias and providing quick analysis . The graphed values are the average percent overlap of all cells for a given condition across experiments . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed on GraphPad Prism 5 ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , CA ) . Graphed values are averages with error bars depicting 6 SEM . Results CCR5 conformations are distributed differentially within a CCR5 - GFP expressing cell line The presence and abundance of CCR5 in the cell membrane are crucial for HIV binding and entry . Using a panel of CCR5 MAbs that were inhibitory to various HIV - 1 isolates as probes for CCR5 conformations [ 31 ] , we investigated whether the cellular distribution of such surface CCR5 populations was distinct . To assess the abundance of various conformations relative to total CCR5 , we generated the U87 . CD4 . CCR5 - GFP stable cell line that expresses GFP on the C - terminal end of CCR5 , thereby preventing interference with ligand binding . MAbs 45531 and CCR5 Conformations Are Dynamic PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 February 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 2 | e89056 2D7 bind the Extracellular Loop 2 ( ECL2 ) of CCR5 while MC - 5 and PA11 both bind the N - terminal ( NT ) epitope , with PA11 recognizing a Tyr - sulfated CCR5 NT . Surface staining in U87 . CD4 . CCR5 - GFP cells with these MAbs generated two distinct distribution patterns . MAb 45531 was previously demon - strated to stain in clusters and bind to membrane regions high in cholesterol [ 31 ] . We similarly observed that MAb 45531 , as well as MC - 5 , typically bound in select regions of the plasma membrane while all other MAbs were more abundant and uniformly distributed throughout the surface of U87 . CD4 . CCR5 - GFP cells ( Figure 1A - D ) . To determine whether the observed staining patterns were unique to the U87 cell line , we also performed surface staining in 293 - Affinofile cells , a dually CD4 - and CCR5 - inducible HEK 293 cell line [ 33 ] . 293 - Affinofile cell surface staining with CCR5 MAbs following treatment with 0 . 25 m M Ponasterone A to induce low CCR5 expression results in a similar staining pattern as seen in U87 . CD4 . CCR5 - GFP cells ( Figure 1E - H ) . Specifically , the uniform staining pattern seen with MAbs 2D7 and PA11 was similar to that in U87 cells . This was distinct from MAbs MC - 5 and 45531 , as both appeared less intense in fluorescence , while 45531 staining also appeared more punctate ( Figure 1F ) . Using a saturating concentration of Ponasterone A , we observed an expected increase in CCR5 protein expression to correspond with elevated levels of surface CCR5 conformations as detected by MAbs ( Figure S2 ) . To quantify MAb labeling of the CCR5 - GFP fusion protein , we measured the voxel - based ( x , y , z ) overlap of TRITC and GFP based on brightness thresholds using an Interactive Data Language ( IDL ) program ( Figure 2 ) . We found that the quantified data complements our visual observations of surface MAb staining . For example , the limited cell surface labeling seen with MAb 45531 was reflected in our quantitative analysis by its percentage labeling total GFP being the least among all MAbs ( Figure 3 ) . Additionally , the abundance of surface conformations detected by PA11 and 2D7 were significantly different from MAb 45531 and MC - 5 ( Figure 3 ) . We also performed staining after cell permeabilization to assess the total presence of each conformation on the surface and within the cell relative to the total CCR5 population . Total staining also allows us to determine the abundance of conformations existing internally by extracting the difference between total and surface labeling percentages for a given MAb ( Figure 2B and C ) . Conformations detected by MAbs 2D7 , 45531 and PA11 were highly distributed on the cell surface , accounting for 78 , 54 and 69 % of each total subpopulation , respectively . The CCR5 population labeled with MC - 5 however , had less than half of its expression at the cell surface ( 14 % of 37 % total CCR5 ) , indicating that the majority of the conformation existed internally ( Figure 3 ) . Taken together , our results highlight the ability of CCR5 conformations to be differentially distin - guished in the cell utilizing our antibody panel . Endocytosis inhibition has varying effects on CCR5 conformations In preliminary experiments aimed to visualize the localization of CCR5 conformations , only certain MAbs demonstrated punctate staining near microvilli structures , an area of dense cross - linked actin filaments which contribute to processes such as endocytosis [ 34 ] . We were therefore interested in whether CCR5 conforma - tions differed in their early trafficking , particularly at endocytosis , and examined this possibility by measuring changes in MAb labeling after disrupting endocytotic pathways . To block endocy - tosis we used sucrose , chlorpromazine and dynasore . Sucrose depletes cytoplasmic pools of clathrin by causing an accumulation of clathrin microcages on the inner membrane of cells and disrupting the normal lattice formation [ 35 ] . Chlorpromazine ( CPZ ) prevents recycling of clathrin by sequestering it near endosomal membranes , whereas dynasore inhibits cellular use of select dynamins used for clathrin - and caveolae - mediated endo - cytosis pathways [ 36 – 38 ] . Cells were treated with an endocytosis inhibitor for 1 hour at 37 u C then surface stained as described in Materials and Methods . Reagent concentrations were chosen based on their ability to restrict transferrin uptake into cells ( Figure S3 ) . A significant reduction in surface labeling occurred for all MAbs upon sucrose treatment , but only for MAbs 2D7 and PA11 after CPZ and dynasore incubation , respectively ( Figure 4 ) . We also investigated whether conformations would be sensitive to nystatin , an inhibitor of caveolae - mediated endocytosis , as some reports show a role of caveolae in CCR5 trafficking [ 39 , 40 ] . Exposure to nystatin led to a reduction in conformations detected by ECL2 - binding MAbs 2D7 and 45531and an increase in PA11 staining ( Figure 4A , B ) . However , these alterations seemed not to be a consequence of caveolae sequestration as dynasore , also an inhibitor of caveolae - mediated endocytosis , did not alter binding ( Figure 4 ) . Instead , nystatin - mediated changes in CCR5 confor - mations are likely due to its effect on membrane cholesterol levels , which has been linked to CCR5 localization and mobility [ 31 , 41 ] . These data show that levels of CCR5 conformations used by HIV - 1 are differentially altered upon interrupting cellular trafficking , specifically the internalization of molecules . Engagement of CCR5 conformations by HIV - 1 - inhibitory peptides leads to conformational changes The dynamic nature of CCR5 has been suggested through changes in receptor conformation upon MVC binding to transmembrane regions [ 10 ] . However , how MVC and HIV inhibitors that bind to extracellular CCR5 domains impact the presence of existing conformations remains poorly defined . To probe the effects of ligand engagement on CCR5 conformations , we used two RANTES analogs , 5P12 and 5P14 , which restrict HIV - 1 infection ( Figure S4A and [ 15 ] ) . Analogs generated from N - terminal modifications of RANTES yield varying degrees of CCR5 binding , signaling and internalization [ 14 , 15 ] . Although neither 5P12 nor 5P14 generate GPCR signaling activity upon CCR5 binding , 5P14 has been demonstrated to induce CCR5 internalization ( Figure S4B and [ 15 ] ) . An essential binding site for CCR5 ligands and RANTES analogs resides in the ECL2 of CCR5 [ 42 ] . Since the ECL2 is also the epitope of MAbs 45531 and 2D7 , epitope masking occurs when analogs are allowed to first bind CCR5 ( Figure S4C ) . We therefore focused our engagement studies on conformations detected by MAbs PA11 and MC - 5 , as their NT binding can still be detected following analog treatment ( Figure S4C ) . Treatment with 5P14 leads to reduced levels of surface conformations detected by MC - 5 and PA11 , an observation consistent with the internalization property of this analog [ 15 ] . Although 5P14 induces CCR5 sequestration , the level of internalization is not as high as other analogs , such as PSC - RANTES [ 15 ] . This was demonstrated by the partial reduction of surface conformations after 5P14 treatment ( Figure 5 , grey bars and Figure S4B ) . We expected the observed 5P14 - induced reduction of surface conformations to not affect total levels of MAb labeling , but to instead generate an increase in internal conformations due to internalization . Indeed , with MAb MC - 5 the percentages of internal conformation detected increased from 23 % to 38 % ( Figure 5B ) and from 20 % to 32 % ( Figure 5D ) . Notably , 5P14 - induced internalization led to increased levels of total PA11 MAb detection ( Figure 5 ) , implying an exposure of additional internal conformations either during the path to CCR5 Conformations Are Dynamic PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 3 February 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 2 | e89056 becoming internalized or once within internal cellular compart - ments . Surprisingly , treatment with non - CCR5 - internalizing 5P12 also reduced the surface and total conformation detected by MC - 5 ( Figure 5B and D ) , but not with PA11 . The decrease in total MC - 5 labeling after 5P12 treatment is likely a result of reduction in the surface conformation detected by this antibody . The unexpected surface reduction of only MC - 5 by 5P12 binding illustrates that changes of select conformations upon engagement is both dynamic and distinct . Several studies implicate internalization via clathrin - coated pits after CCR5 agonist binding [ 39 , 43 ] . We further investigated whether the 5P12 and 5P14 engaging mechanism is sensitive to clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and whether this sensitivity is distinct for specific CCR5 conformations . Cells were either treated with analogs or endocytosis inhibitors alone , or pretreated with endocytosis inhibitors followed by addition of analogs , and then stained for surface and total conformations as described in Materials and Methods . For surface and total staining , we observed reduced labeling of both MC - 5 and PA11 when treated with sucrose , and unchanged labeling upon CPZ treatment , both observations consistent with previous experiments ( Figure 4 ) . We focused on comparing conditions with analog alone and analog after pretreatment with endocytosis inhibitors to gauge the effect of internalization after analog engagement . Sucrose significantly reduced both PA11 and MC - 5 5P12 - engaged surface labeling , whereas there was no change when combined with 5P14 ( Figure 5 A and B ; grey bars ) . This suggests that the 5P14 - mediated internalization of the probed surface conformations is not likely altered by inhibiting clathrin - mediated endocytosis . The loss of surface conformations upon combined sucrose and 5P12 treat - ment is likely due to sucrose , an effect seen when comparing untreated with sucrose - treated cells ( Figure 5 ) , and in former experiments using other MAbs ( Figure 4 ) . This trend demonstrates the consistent sensitivity of various CCR5 conformations to Figure 1 . Surface CCR5 conformation localization within U87 . CD4 . CCR5 - GFP cells .

For both MAbs , pretreatment with CPZ did not considerably alter surface labeling upon 5P12 and 5P14 engagement ( Figure 5 C and D ; grey bars ) . However , a significant reduction in total labeling for both MAbs occurred when combining inhibitors with 5P14 ( Figure 5 ; black bars ) to a much greater extent than the reduction at the cell surface , demonstrating an overall decrease in internal levels . Such results have implications for trafficking on CCR5 internal conformations when they are engaged with ligands . G protein uncoupling from CCR5 can alter surface CCR5 conformations CCR5 has been shown to become stabilized in a high - affinity conformation for agonists upon coupling to NF G proteins [ 32 ] . Our observation that ligands can affect the surface exposure of CCR5 conformations led us to investigate whether such external responses can be manipulated through intracellular changes within CCR5 domains , specifically their association with G proteins . We treated U87 . CD4 . CCR5 - GFP cells with 1 m g / mL pertussis toxin ( PTX ) for 1 hour at 37 u C to prevent the activation of the G a i protein , and then surface stained using CCR5 MAbs . PTX treatment increased the labeling with MAb 45531 , but not with MAbs 2D7 and PA11 ( Figure 6 ) . This result was particularly surprising due to the lack of agonist engagement , which would lead to PTX - sensitive G protein coupling and subsequent receptor activation . Instead , our data illustrates that disruption of the G protein receptor association , even for unbound CCR5 conforma - tions , can affect receptor population levels at the cell surface . Discussion Understanding how trafficking and signaling influences CCR5 populations is important for understanding CCR5 biology and HIV - 1 pathogenesis . With knowledge that CCR5 antibodies can bind distinct CCR5 conformational populations , our research used MAbs as probes to investigate the spatial distribution and changes among CCR5 populations upon altering CCR5 trafficking and receptor association with G i a . To this end , we established a quantification method that utilized individual voxel fluorescence intensities to measure MAb staining relative to total CCR5 present within a cell . Visual and quantitative analyses demonstrate the existence of CCR5 conformations through disparate surface and total labeling among CCR5 MAbs . MAb 45531 detected a Figure 2 .

Inhibition studies demonstrated that MAb 45531 restricts Vicriviroc ( VVC ) - resistant HIV - 1 and not the VVC - sensitive parental HIV - 1 strain , whereas MAbs 2D7 and PA11 were able to restrict parental and to some extent VVC - resistant strains [ 31 ] . These data support the view that certain CCR5 conformations are used selectively and suggest that HIV - 1 utilizes conformations most abundant on the cell surface , a possible means to increase the likelihood of coreceptor binding and entry . However , in the case of selective pressure , as with CCR5 inhibitor - resistant viruses , HIV - 1 is capable of utilizing CCR5 conformations having limited presence on the cell surface , an adaptation likely to maximize chances of binding . Using RANTES analogs possessing antiviral potency , we investigated whether their engagement promotes different re - sponses between CCR5 conformations . Binding of PSC - RANTES to CCR5 creates a durable association that leads to long - term sequestration within internalized compartments , a result poten - tially due to exposing a particular CCR5 conformation that is unfavorable for trafficking back to the cell surface [ 25 ] . Coinciding with this , our results show that 5P14 also appears to play a role in altering internal conformations . While characterization of 5P14 has determined that CCR5 down - modulation is reason for its inhibitory mechanism [ 15 ] , identifying whether its ability to internally expose new conformations is conserved during routes back to the plasma membrane can be a topic for future investigations . Understanding the relationship between the ability of analogs to restrict infection and their effect on CCR5 conformations is important for the optimization of more effective inhibitory agents . Ideally , it would be beneficial to develop an analog that promotes CCR5 internalization , but not agonist activity , and is able to restore to the cell surface CCR5 conformations not highly utilized by HIV - 1 . Analog 5P12 has been characterized as a potent anti - HIV molecule , yet the restriction mechanism has not been fully defined [ 15 ] . In our studies , we observed differences in the response of MC - 5 - and PA11 - detecting conformations to 5P12 , a potential insight into the restrictive activity of 5P12 . This result may also have been due to PA11 detecting a Tyr - sulfated NT [ 31 ] , as CCR5 post - transla - tional modifications of extracellular domains have been demon - strated to influence chemokine binding [ 44 ] . As the binding of chemokine analogs to high - affinity CCR5 populations has been recently demonstrated [ 32 ] , our studies additionally highlight the CCR5 conformation heterogeneity in responses to ligand engage - ment . Investigating constitutive and agonist - induced internalization has implications for understanding trafficking mechanisms that will eventually lead to resurfacing of CCR5 to the plasma membrane , an important topic as the presence of select CCR5 populations is beneficial for HIV - 1 binding . Cellular treatments with endocytosis inhibitors led to changes within surface confor - mations , and more notably with the internal PA11 - detecting conformation upon 5P14 treatment in comparison to analog treatment alone ( Figures 4 and 5 ) . The sensitivities to inhibitors were most significant and consistent with sucrose , as collectively , conformations were not significantly altered when clathrin - Figure 4 .

The sucrose endocytosis inhibition mechanism may therefore provide insight into the use of specific adaptor molecules by CCR5 conformations for trafficking , an area for future investigations . Our results did not implicate use of caveolae - mediated endocytosis for constitutive internalization of the probed CCR5 conformations . Loss of CCR5 internalization has been illustrated with filipin , an inhibitor of caveolae - mediated endocytosis that , like nystatin , also sequesters membrane choles - terol [ 40 ] . The association of cholesterol with CCR5 has been demonstrated with evidence showing its necessity for CCR5 mobility [ 41 ] , and with recent evidence suggesting the presence of a CCR5 conformation in cholesterol - rich lipid - rafts [ 31 ] . The observed increase in PA11 MAb labeling upon nystatin treatment is also likely due to the cholesterol sequestering effect of this compound , and provides support for select CCR5 conformations existing in membrane regions enriched in cholesterol . Studies demonstrate that GPCRs and G proteins can exist in a precoupled state [ 45 – 47 ] , and that interaction of G proteins with CCR5 can influence ligand and HIV - 1 binding [ 48 , 49 ] . In addition to the unique labeling and HIV - 1 restriction of MAb 45531 , PTX treatment only affected MAb 45531 labeling ( Figure 6 ) . Other data demonstrate that cholesterol in membranes is essential for CCR5 signaling [ 40 ] . As the conformation detected by MAb 45531 may already exist in cholesterol - rich regions [ 31 ] Figure 5 . CCR5 conformation changes upon engagement . U87 . CD4 .

Although recent data demonstrates that select CCR5 MAbs , one being 45531 , can exhibit some nonspecific binding [ 50 ] , our quantification method detects MAb positive voxels overlapping with CCR5 / GFP , minimizing the inclusion of any off - target binding . Since the MAbs used in our research display some level of restriction to parental or VVC - inhibitor - resistant HIV - 1 infection , our studies shed light on the use and characteristics of distinct CCR5 conformations with relevance to their utilization by HIV - 1 . Additionally , our results underscore the importance of the diversity of CCR5 antibodies and their ability to detect different CCR5 conformations . Clarity in understanding the use of CCR5 conformations can be increased in future studies investigating their presence in primary cells . Moreover , future studies investi - gating CCR5 should consider the existence of multiple confor - mations during analysis . Supporting Information Figure S1 CCR5 - GFP protein is intact within U87 .
