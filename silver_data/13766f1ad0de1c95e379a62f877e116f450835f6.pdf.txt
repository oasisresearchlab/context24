Syntenin is thought to 37 drive the biogenesis of CD63 exosomes by recruiting Alix and the ESCRT machinery to 38 endosomes , initiating an endosome - mediated pathway of exosome biogenesis . Contrary to this 39 model , we show here that syntenin drives the biogenesis of CD63 exosomes by blocking CD63 40 endocytosis , thereby allowing CD63 to accumulate at the plasma membrane , the primary site of 41 exosome biogenesis . Consistent with these results , we find that inhibitors of endocytosis induce the 42 exosomal secretion of CD63 , that endocytosis inhibits the vesicular secretion of exosome cargo 43 proteins , and that high - level expression of CD63 itself also inhibits endocytosis . These and other 44 results indicate that exosomes bud primarily from the plasma membrane , that endocytosis inhibits 45 their loading into exosomes , that syntenin and CD63 are expression - dependent regulators of 46 exosome biogenesis , and that syntenin drives the biogenesis of CD63 exosomes even in Alix 47 knockout cells . 48 49 50 51 52 53 Introduction 54 55 Exosomes are ~ 30 - 150 nm in diameter , have the same topology as the cell , and are highly enriched 56 in specific exosomal proteins , especially the exosomal tetraspanins ( e . g . CD81 , CD9 , and CD63 ( 1 - 57 4 ) ) and their associated scaffolds ( e . g . syntenin ( 2 , 5 ) ) . Exosomes are released by all eukaryotic 58 cells , and animals use exosomes for a wide variety of biological processes , including the 59 transmission of signals and molecules to neighboring cells , modification of biofluids and 60 extracellular structures , and protein quality control within exosome - producing cells ( 6 ) . A clear 61 understanding of exosome biogenesis is therefore critical to our understanding of basic cell biology , 62 human health and disease , and the emerging field of exosome - based therapeutics ( 7 - 10 ) . Human 63 cells also release other types of extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) , both small and large , yet exosomes are 64 unique in their selective enrichment of specific cargo proteins , especially the exosomal tetraspanins . 65 66 Of the highly - enriched cargoes found in exosomes , CD63 is thought to be the cargo protein that 67 best defines the exosome biogenesis pathway ( 11 - 14 ) . It is widely presumed that this pathway 68 requires the endocytosis and endosomal accumulation of CD63 , where it recruits the cD63 - binding 69 protein syntenin , the syntenin - binding protein Alix , and the Alix - binding endosomal sorting 70 complexes required for transport ( ESCRT ) , presumably to drive the biogenesis of intralumenal 71 vesicles ( ILVs ) that can later be secreted via endolysosomal exocytosis ( 12 , 15 - 23 ) . In support of 72 this model , CD63 has been shown to binding syntenin directly , with the C - terminal four amino 73 acids of CD63 being bound directly by syntenin’s PDZ domains and C - terminal peptide ( syntenin 74 amino acids 100 - 29 ) , leaving syntenin’s N - terminal 100 amino acids free to bind Alix , through its 75 three Alix - binding YPLxL motifs ( 24 ) . These protein - protein interactions provide critical insights 76 into the assembly of endosome - localized CD63 / syntenin / Alix complexes , but its currently unclear 77 whether these interactions are involved in the exosomal secretion of CD63 , the lysosomal 78 trafficking and degradation of CD63 and its partner proteins ( 25 - 30 ) , or some other CD63 - mediated 79 process . 80 81 Contrary to this endosome - dependent model of exosome biogenesis , our group has established that 82 the most highly enriched exosome cargo proteins ( e . g . CD81 , CD9 , etc . ) all reside at the plasma 83 membrane ( 3 , 4 , 31 - 33 ) , that targeting these plasma membrane - localized exosome cargoes to 84 endosomes greatly reduces their exosomal secretion ( 3 , 4 , 33 ) , and that that redirecting CD63 from 85 endosomes to the plasma membrane greatly increased its exosomal secretion ( 3 , 4 ) . These results 86 support an alternative hypothesis in which exosome biogenesis is mediated by a shared , stochastic 87 mechanism that operates along the spectrum of plasma and endosome membranes , with most 88 exosomes arising by direct budding from the cell surface ( 3 , 4 , 6 ) . 89 90 One approach to testing between these models is to knockout these genes and ask whether loss of 91 CD63 , Alix , or syntenin causes a defect in exosome biogenesis . Although knockout of the CD63 or 92 Alix genes failed to cause a defect in exosome biogenesis ( 3 ) , knockout of syntenin caused an ~ 50 % 93 reduction in the exosomal secretion of CD63 ( 13 ) , providing a genetic context for studying 94 syntenin’s role in exosome biogenesis . Using a combination of genetic and cell biological studies , 95 we show that syntenin plays a key role in the exosomal secretion of CD63 by blocking CD63 96 endocytosis , which allows it to accumulate at the primary site of exosome biogenesis , the plasma 97 membrane . We also show that endocytosis is a general inhibitor of exosome cargo protein budding , 98 and that high - level expression of CD63 induces its own exosomal secretion by saturating the 99 clathrin adaptor AP - 2 and blocking its endocytosis and the endocytosis of other lysosome 100 membrane proteins . 101 102 103 104 Results 105 106 Syntenin expression induces the exosomal secretion of CD63 107 As noted above , knockout or silencing of the syntenin gene causes a selective defect in the exosomal 108 secretion of CD63 ( 13 , 21 ) . To determine whether loss of syntenin results in the same phenotype in 109 293F cells , we knocked out the syntenin gene ( SDCBP ) in this human cell line ( fig . S1 ) . The 110 resulting F / SDCBP - / - cell line displayed the same , CD63 - selective phenotype as previously 111 reported ( 13 , 21 ) , reducing the exosomal secretion of CD63 but showing no effect on the exosomal 112 secretion of CD81 or CD9 ( fig . S1 ) . 113 114 To shed more light on syntenin’s role in exosome biogenesis , we asked whether its high - level 115 expression was sufficient to induce the complementary phenotype of increased CD63 budding , and 116 if so , whether this effect was selective to CD63 . Towards this end , we created Tet - on 293F ( FtetZ ) 117 cell lines that carry doxycycline - inducible , TRE3G - driven transgenes encoding ( i ) syntenin ; ( ii ) the 118 syntenin mutant D N100syntenin , which binds CD63 but not Alix ; or ( iii ) the syntenin mutant 119 syntenin D C23 , which binds Alix but not CD63 ( 24 ) . These and control ( FtetZ ) cells were grown in 120 the absence or presence of doxycycline , followed by collection of cell and exosome fractions , 121 measurement of transgene - encoded syntenin expression by qRT - PCR ( fig . S2 ) , and interrogation 122 of cell and exosome samples by immunoblot to measure the exosomal secretion of CD63 , CD81 , 123 and CD9 ( Fig . 1A - C ) . 124 125 In the absence of doxycycline , all three syntenin transgene - encoded mRNAs were expressed at 126 similar levels ( fig . S2 ) . This baseline expression was quite low , as we could not detect the syntenin 127 protein by immunoblot in either FtetZ cells or FtetZ : : syntenin cells ( Fig . 1A ) . Nevertheless , the low 128 baseline expression of D N100syntenin triggered a significant increase in the exosomal secretion of 129 CD63 , indicating that this N - terminal syntenin truncation mutant was a particularly potent inducer 130 of CD63 exosome biogenesis , even though it no longer contained syntenin’s Alix - binding sites . 131 Furthermore , when these same four cell lines were grown in the presence of doxycycline , we found 132 that high - level expression of the syntenin and D N100syntenin transgenes both induced the 133 exosomal secretion of CD63 , whereas syntenin D C23 did not ( Fig . 1B , C ) . Furthermore , these 134 effects were selective to CD63 , as high - level expression of syntenin or D N100syntenin had no 135 effect on the exosomal secretion of either CD81 or CD9 ( Fig . 1A - C ) . Similar results were observed 136 in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts ( fig . S3 ) . 137 138 Syntenin induces the plasma membrane accumulation of CD63 139 These immunoblots confirmed our prior discovery that CD81 and CD9 are loaded into exosomes 140 far more efficiently than CD63 ( 15 - fold and 5 - fold , respectively ) ( 1 , 3 , 4 ) , showed that high - level 141 expression allows CD63 to bud from cells at efficiencies that rival CD81 and CD9 , and in so doing 142 raised the possibility that syntenin was inducing the exosomal secretion of CD63 by relieving an 143 inhibition of CD63’s exosomal secretion . As for what this inhibitory effect might be , we previously 144 discovered that endocytosis inhibits CD63’s exosomal secretion by ~ 6 - fold ( 3 , 4 ) . To determine 145 whether syntenin might be inhibiting the endocytosis of CD63 , we used flow cytometry to measure 146 the plasma membrane abundance of CD63 , CD9 , and CD81 in uninduced and doxycycline - induced 147 cultures of these same four cell lines . At baseline , plasma membrane CD63 was ~ 80 % higher in 148 D N100syntenin cells and was unchanged in cells carrying the syntenin or syntenin D C23 transgenes 149 ( n = 3 , p < 0 . 0005 ) , while all four cell lines had similar levels of cell surface CD81 and CD9 ( Fig . 150 1D - F ) . As for the doxycycline - induced cells , high - level expression of syntenin or D N100syntenin 151 increased the plasma membrane abundance of CD63 by 3 - fold and 5 - fold , respectively ( n = 3 , p 152 < 0 . 0005 ) , whereas syntenin D C23 had no effect , and the plasma membrane levels of CD81 and CD9 153 were largely unchanged ( Fig . 1G - I ) . Similar results were observed in Hela cells ( Fig . S3 ) . 154 155 Syntenin blocks CD63 endocytosis 156 The preceding results predict that high level expression of syntenin or D N100syntenin will block 157 the endocytosis of CD63 , as syntenin binds directly to the same C - terminal four amino acids of 158 CD63 that comprise its endocytosis signal , - YEVMcooh , which is also bound by the mu2 subunit 159 of the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 ( 24 , 34 , 35 ) . We therefore seeded these four cell lines onto glass 160 coverslips , incubated them in doxycycline - containing media overnight , then shifted them to 4 o C , 161 stained them with fluorescently tagged antibodies to ( green ) CD63 and ( pink ) CD9 ( also at 4 o C ) , 162 washed ( also at 4 o C ) , then either fixed them immediately ( t = 0 ) or following incubation at 37 o C 163 for 30 minutes ( t = 30 ) . Examination of these cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy confirmed 164 that the control FtetZ cells endocytosed CD63 from the cell surface , leading to the rapid 165 accumulation of CD63 - antibody complexes in internal compartments scattered throughout the 166 cytoplasm , whereas CD9 remained at the cell surface ( Fig . 1J , N ) . In contrast , cells expressing 167 either WT syntenin ( Fig . 1K , O ) or D N100syntenin ( Fig . 1L , P ) failed to endocytose CD63 , 168 demonstrating that high - level expression of syntenin had indeed blocked the endocytosis of CD63 . 169 This phenotype was specific for CD63 - binding forms of syntenin , as high - level expression of 170 syntenin D C23 failed to inhibit the endocytosis of CD63 ( Fig . 1M , Q ) . These results are consistent 171 with those of Latysheva et al . ( 24 ) , who previously established that syntenin is an expression - 172 dependent inhibitor of CD63 endocytosis . 173 174 Syntenin drives the loading of CD63 into plasma membrane - derived , CD81 / CD9 exosomes 175 We next tested whether high - level expression of syntenin affects the overall yield of exosome - sized 176 EVs by counting their concentration in each of the above cultures . Small EVs were collected from 177 each culture supernatant ( by clarifying filtration , concentrating filtration , and size exclusion 178 chromatography ) and then interrogated by nanoparticle tracking analysis ( NTA ) . Exosome yields 179 were similar among all four cell lines and were not altered by addition of doxycycline ( Fig . 2A ) , 180 indicating that high - level expression of syntenin induced the exosomal secretion of CD63 without 181 increasing the production of exosome - sized vesicles . 182 183 We next tested whether syntenin induced the loading of CD63 into plasma membrane - derived 184 exosomes , which are marked by CD81 and CD9 ( 3 , 4 , 11 ) . Towards this end , we interrogated the 185 doxycycline - induced exosome fractions using the combined technologies of single - particle 186 interferometric reflectance ( SPIR ) imaging , provides label - free measurement of individual 187 exosome sizes , and conventional immunofluorescence microscopy ( IFM ) , which allowed us to 188 quantify the abundance of CD63 on each of thousands of individual exosomes ( 3 , 4 , 36 ) . In brief , 189 each exosome sample was subject to immunopurification on SPIR imaging chips that had been 190 functionalized with a monoclonal antibody specific for human CD81 , followed by staining with an 191 Alexa Fluor 647 ( AF647 ) - labeled antibody specific for CD63 . Samples were then washed , fixed , 192 and examined by SPIR - IFM imaging , allowing us to measure the sizes and CD63 levels on 193 hundreds of individual CD81 - positive exosomes produced by each cell line . CD63 fluorescence 194 intensity was gated to exclude low and ambiguous signals , and the resulting plots of exosome size 195 versus CD63 staining intensity revealed that CD63 was abundant on only ~ 7 % of CD81 exosomes 196 produced by FtetZ : : TRE3G - syntenin D C23 cells ( 152 / 2044 ) , that expression of syntenin increased 197 this to ~ 40 % ( 988 / 2389 ) , and that expression of D N100syntenin increased to ~ 35 % ( 991 / 2791 ) . As 198 for the exosomes produced by FtetZ cells , ~ 15 % of CD81 - positive exosomes carried this level of 199 CD63 ( 250 / 1690 ) , about twice the level seen in doxycycline - induced FtetZ : : TRE3G - syntenin D C23 200 cells . 201 We also performed parallel studies in which the exosomes were immunopurified on SPIR imaging 202 chips that had been functionalized with an anti - CD9 monoclonal antibody , then stained with 203 AF647 - labeled anti - CD63 antibodies . SPIR - IFM imaging of these exosomes revealed that high 204 levels of CD63 were detected on ~ 6 % of CD9 exosomes produced by FtetZ : : TRE3G - syntenin D C23 205 cells ( 85 / 1440 ) , ~ 35 % of CD9 exosomes produced by FtetZ : : TRE3G - syntenin cells ( 721 / 2059 ) , 206 ~ 35 % of CD9 exosomes produced by FtetZ : : TRE3G - D N100syntenin cells ( 433 / 1267 ) , and ~ 16 % 207 of CD9 exosomes produced by FtetZ cells ( 159 / 966 ) ( Fig . 2F - I ) . 208 209 As an orthologous approach to single exosome immunophenotyping , we interrogated exosomes 210 from control and syntenin - expressing cells by quantitative single - molecule localization microscopy 211 ( qSMLM ) . In brief , CD81 / CD9 - positive exosomes were immunopurified on glass coverslips 212 functionalized with a mixture of monoclonal antibodies specific for human CD81 and CD9 , then 213 stained with an AF647 - labeled antibody specific for human CD63 and a pair of AF568 - labeled 214 antibodies specific for CD81 and CD9 . The resulting samples were then washed , fixed , and 215 examined by qSMLM . Of the CD81 / CD9 - positive exosomes produced by doxycycline - induced 216 FtetZ and FtetZ : : TRE3G - syntenin cells , we found that FtetZ exosomes contained an average of 10 217 detected CD63 molecules ( coefficient of variation ( c . v . ) 102 % ) whereas FtetZ : : syntenin exosomes 218 contained an average of 18 detected CD63 molecules ( c . v . 102 % ) ( Fig . 2J ) . Also , when we 219 calculated the percentage of CD81 / CD9 - positive exosomes that lacked detectable levels of CD63 , 220 we found that it fell from ~ 35 % for exosomes produced by FtetZ cells to ~ 15 % for exosomes 221 produced by syntenin - expressing cells ( Fig . 2K ) . Syntenin had no substantive effect on exosome 222 size , as exosomes produced by FtetZ cells and FtetZ : : TRE3G - syntenin cells had similar diameters 223 ( mean of 107nm ( c . v . 26 % ) and 113 nm ( c . v . 30 % ) , respectively ) . 224 225 Syntenin - induced exosome biogenesis is an Alix - independent process 226 Numerous studies have proposed that Alix plays a critical role in exosome biogenesis , and in 227 particular , that Alix drives exosome biogenesis by linking CD63 - syntenin complexes to the ESCRT 228 machinery ( 12 , 15 - 23 ) . We therefore tested whether loss of Alix prevents the syntenin - induced 229 exosomal secretion of CD63 . Specifically , we created HtetZ / Alix - / - cells , a Tet - On derivative of an 230 Alix - / - HEK293 cell line ( 3 ) , then modified this HtetZ / Alix - / - cell line to carry the doxycycline - 231 regulated transgenes encoding syntenin , D N100syntenin , or syntenin D C23 . We then examined 232 uninduced and doxycycline - induced cultures of these cell lines by flow cytometry . Even though 233 these Alix - / - cells lack Alix protein , high - level expression of syntenin or D N100syntenin still 234 induced the selective plasma membrane accumulation of CD63 ( fig . S4A - C ) . In addition , 235 immunoblot of cell and exosome fractions from these Alix - / - cell lines demonstrated that high - level 236 expression of syntenin or D N100syntenin still induced the exosomal secretion of CD63 ( fig . S4D , 237 E ) . Thus , Alix is not required for the syntenin - induced exosomal secretion of CD63 , consistent with 238 the fact that Alix knockout cells show no defect in the release of exosome - sized vesicles or the 239 exosomal secretion of CD81 , CD9 , or CD63 ( 3 ) , and that D N100syntenin induced the exosomal 240 secretion of CD63 ( Fig . 1A - C ) , even though it lacks all three of syntenin’s Alix - binding YPLxL 241 motifs ( 24 ) . 242 243 General inhibitors of endocytosis induce the exosomal secretion of CD63 244 The hypothesis that emerges from these data is that syntenin drives the exosomal secretion of CD63 245 indirectly , by blocking its endocytosis and inducing its accumulation at the primary site of exosome 246 biogenesis , the plasma membrane . If this hypothesis is correct , then other , mechanistic distinct 247 inhibitors of CD63 endocytosis should also induce the exosomal secretion of CD63 . To test this 248 prediction , we used Cas9 to generate mutations in the AP2M1 gene , which encodes the mu2 subunit 249 of the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 ( 35 , 37 - 39 ) . This effort yielded a single 293F AP2M1 - / - cell line , and 250 sequence analysis of these cells revealed that this cell line has a large deletion on AP2M1 allele # 1 251 and a 1 codon deletion ( D Ile63 ) on AP2M1 allele # 2 ( fig . S5 ) . To determine whether this F / AP2M1 - 252 / - cell line was defective in CD63 endocytosis , we grew it and control 293F cells on glass coverslips , 253 chilled them to 4 o C , incubated them with fluorescently tagged antibodies specific for CD63 and 254 CD9 ( also at 4 o C ) , then washed the cells and fixed them either immediately ( t = 0 ) or after a 30 255 minutes - long incubation at 37 o C ( t = 30 ) . Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that 256 293F cells rapidly endocytosed CD63 from the cell surface ( Fig . 3A , B ) but that F / AP2M1 - / - cells 257 did not ( Fig . 3C , D ) , demonstrating that F / AP2M1 - / - cells were indeed defective in CD63 258 endocytosis . Not surprisingly , interrogation of these cells by flow cytometry revealed a selective , 259 ~ 4 - fold increase in plasma membrane CD63 abundance , but no change in cell surface CD81 or CD9 260 ( Fig . 3E ) . Importantly , immunoblot analysis of cell and exosome fractions from these cells showed 261 that F / AP2M1 - / - cells display an ~ 2 - fold increase in their exosomal secretion of CD63 ( Fig . 3F , G ) , 262 demonstrating that a mechanistically distinct inhibition of CD63 endocytosis was sufficient to 263 induce a selective increase in the exosomal secretion of CD63 . 264 265 Previous studies have established that actin polymerization plays a critical role in protein 266 endocytosis by providing a driving force for membrane invagination , that latrunculin A inhibits 267 actin polymerization by sequestering actin monomers , and that hat latrinculin A also inhibits protein 268 endocytosis ( 40 - 44 ) . In light of these considerations , latrunculin A should also induce a selective 269 increase in the exosomal secretion of CD63 . To test this prediction , we grew 293F cells in media 270 lacking or containing latrunculin A , collected their exosomes , and interrogated them by immunoblot 271 for CD63 , CD81 , and CD9 . This revealed that latrunculin increased the exosomal secretion of CD63 272 by ~ 7 - fold but had no effect on the exosomal secretion of CD81 and only a minor effect on the 273 exosomal secretion of CD9 ( Fig . 3H , I ) , providing additional evidence that inhibiting endocytosis 274 is sufficient to selectively induce the exosomal secretion of CD63 . 275 276 Endocytosis signals inhibit the exosomal secretion of cargo proteins in cis and in trans 277 The antagonism between endocytosis and exosome biogenesis is consistent with our previous 278 discoveries that endosome membrane anchors are unable to induce the exosomal secretion of cargo 279 proteins ( 33 ) , that appending an endocytosis signal to the C - terminus of CD9 greatly reduced its 280 exosomal secretion from the cell ( 3 , 4 ) , and that elimination of CD63’s endocytosis signal greatly 281 increased its exosomal secretion from the cell ( 3 , 4 ) ( a result later confirmed by others ( 11 ) ) . Here 282 we extend these studies by exploring the post - endocytosis fates of exosome cargoes , the effect of 283 cargo protein expression level , or the fact that endocytosis signal - containing proteins can saturate 284 AP - 2 and inhibit protein endocytosis ( 45 , 46 ) . Specifically , we used Cas9 - mediated gene editing to 285 generate a CD9 - / - / - 293F cell line ( fig . S6 ) , converted it to a Tet - on cell line ( FtetZ / CD9 - / - / - ) , and 286 then created derivatives of this FtetZ / CD9 - / - / - cell line that carry doxycycline - regulated transgenes 287 designed to express WT CD9 or mutant forms of CD9 , including CD9 - YQRF , which does not bind 288 syntenin but has high affinity for the mu2 subunit of AP - 2 ( 35 ) , CD9 - YQTI , which also does not 289 bind syntenin but binds the mu2 protein and also the mu3 subunit of AP - 3 ( 35 ) , CD9 - YEVM , which 290 binds syntenin and also AP - 2 and AP - 3 ( 24 , 35 ) , and CD9 - AEMV , which lacks the motifs for 291 binding syntenin , AP - 2 , or AP - 3 . 292 293 Although qRT - PCR experiments showed that level of transgene - encoded CD9 mRNA was similar 294 in all cell lines ( fig . S7 ) , immunoblot experiments showed that the amount of CD9 protein was not 295 ( Fig . 4A ) . Specifically , CD9 and CD9 - AEMV were readily detected in both cell and exosome 296 lysates whereas we were unable to detect the CD9 - YQRF , CD9 - YQTI , or CD9 - YEVM in either 297 cells or exosomes . Furthermore , addition of the vacuolar ATPase ( V - ATPase ) inhibitor bafilomycin 298 A partly restored the abundance of these proteins ( fig . S8 ) , indicating that CD9 - YQRF , CD9 - YQTI , 299 and CD9 - YEVM were being degraded by the plasma membrane - to - lysosome trafficking 300 pathway ( 47 - 49 ) . These results demonstrate that endocytosis inhibits the exosomal secretion of 301 cargo proteins by targeting them for destruction , as well as by removing them from the primary site 302 of exosome biogenesis at the plasma membrane . 303 304 To determine whether the level of CD9 expression has any effect on the dynamics of CD9 stability 305 or exosomal secretion , we repeated these experiments on cell and exosome lysates collected from 306 doxycycline - induced cell cultures . As expected , CD9 and CD9 - AEMV were even more abundant 307 in both cell and exosome lysates ( Fig . 4B ) . Furthermore , we found that high - level expression of 308 CD9 - YQRF , CD9 - YQTI , or CD9 - YEVM led to their accumulation in the cell to the point where 309 they could be easily detected , and also led to their exosomal secretion from the cell . This allowed 310 us to calculate the relative exosomal secretion of all five CD9 proteins , which proved to be ~ 3 - fold 311 higher for CD9 and CD9 - AEMV than for CD9 - YQRF , CD9 - YQTI , and CD9 - YEVM ( n = 3 , p 312 < 0 . 005 ) , demonstrating once again that endocytosis inhibits the vesicular secretion of exosome 313 cargo proteins ( Fig . 4C ) . 314 315 These data also raised the question of why the plasma membrane - to - lysosome 316 trafficking / destruction of CD9 - Yxx F proteins was inhibited by their doxycycline - induced 317 expression . This pathway has multiple steps that are potentially subject to saturating inhibition 318 ( clathrin - mediated endocytosis , uncoating of endocytic vesicles , fusion of these vesicles with 319 endosomes , loading of endocytosed CD9 into ILVs , delivery of CD9 - ILVs to lysosomes , and 320 lysosomal hydrolysis of CD9 - ILV lipids and proteins ) . However , the most notable of these is 321 endocytosis , as previous studies have already shown that AP - 2 - mediated endocytosis is inhibited 322 by high - level expression of endocytosis signal - containing proteins ( 45 , 46 ) . To explore this 323 possibility , we used flow cytometry to measure the cell surface expression of each CD9 protein at 324 both their baseline and induced levels of expression . 325 326 In the absence of doxycycline , CD9 and CD9 - AEMV were abundant at the plasma membrane , 327 whereas anti - CD9 staining for CD9 - YQRF , CD9 - YQTI , and CD9 - YEVM was minimal , only 328 slightly higher than the background staining observed for F / CD9 - / - / - control cells ( Fig . 4D ) . In 329 presence of doxycycline , the plasma membrane levels of CD9 and CD9 - AEMV rose by ~ 3 - fold , 330 consistent with the higher level of exosomal secretion seen for the doxycycline - induced cultures of 331 these cell lines . However , the biggest impact of doxycycline - induced expression was the ~ 100 - fold 332 increase in the cell surface abundance of CD9 - YQRF , CD9 - YQTI , and CD9 - YEVM ( Fig . 4D - G ) . 333 The end result of this ~ 100 - fold increase was that their plasma membrane abundance was only ~ 5 - 334 fold less than WT CD9 and CD9 - AEMV ( n = 3 , p < 0 . 0005 ) , raising the possibility that the 335 expression - induced exosomal secretion of these CD9 - Yxx F proteins ( Fig . 4B ) was caused by their 336 plasma membrane accumulation and direct budding from the cell surface . 337 338 If high - level expression of CD9 - YQRF , CD9 - YQTI , and CD9 - YEVM was inhibiting AP - 2 - 339 mediated endocytosis , this inhibition should be reflected in an expression - dependent , CD9 - Yxx F - 340 specific increase in the plasma membrane abundance of CD63 . At baseline levels of CD9 transgene 341 expression , the cell surface abundance of CD63 was the same in F / CD9 - / - / - control cells as in each 342 of the CD9 - expressing cell lines ( Fig . 4H ) . However , the doxycycline - induced expression of CD9 - 343 YQRF , CD9 - YQTI , or CD9 - YEVM led to a pronounced increase in the cell surface abundance of 344 CD63 , 10 - fold in the case of CD9 - YQRF and 5 - fold in the case of CD9 - YQTI or CD9 - YEVM , 345 while high - level expression of WT CD9 or CD9 - AEMV had no effect on the cell surface abundance 346 of CD63 ( Fig . 4H - J ) . Given that similar increases in plasma membrane accumulation of CD63 are 347 associated with increased exosomal secretion of CD63 , we interrogated cell and exosome fractions 348 from doxycycline - induced cultures by immunoblot for CD63 , observing that high level expression 349 of CD9 - YQRF or CD9 - YQTI , and to a lesser extent CD9 - YEVM , induced the exosomal secretion 350 of CD63 ( Fig . 4K ) . 351 352 CD63 is an expression - dependent regulator of AP - 2 - mediated endocytosis and exosome content 353 The preceding results demonstrate a complex interplay between the expression level of Yxx F - 354 containing exosome cargo proteins , their endocytosis , their exosomal secretion , and the endocytosis 355 and exosomal secretion of other Yxx F - containing proteins . To determine whether CD63 displayed 356 a similar complexity of effects on the sorting and exosomal secretion of Yxx F - containing exosome 357 cargo proteins , we first tested whether it display an expression - dependent inhibition of its own 358 endocytosis . Towards this end , we created FtetZ / CD63 - / - cells , a Tet - on derivative of the previously 359 described 293F CD63 - / - cell line ( 50 ) , and then generated a derivative of FtetZ / CD63 - / - cells that 360 carries a doxycycline - regulated , TRE3G - CD63 transgene , the FtetZ / CD63 - / - : : TRE3G - CD63 cell 361 line . These cells were seeded onto glass coverslips , incubated overnight in normal medium or 362 medium supplemented with doxycycline , chilled to 4 o C , incubated with fluorescently - labeled 363 antibodies specific for CD63 , washed , and then fixed either immediately ( t = 0 ) or after a 30 364 minutes - long incubation at 37 o C ( t = 30 ) . When these cells were examined by confocal fluorescence 365 microscopy , we observed that CD63 was endocytosed by the uninduced cells but not by the 366 doxycycline - induced cells ( Fig . 5 ) , demonstrating that high - level expression of WT CD63 inhibits 367 its own endocytosis . 368 369 We next tested the effect of CD63 endocytosis signal substitutions and expression level on the cell 370 surface abundance of CD63 and other proteins . Towards this end , we created three more 371 FtetZ / CD63 - / - : : TRE3G - CD63 - like cell lines designed to express CD63 - YQRF ( binds AP - 2 but not 372 syntenin ) , CD63 - YQTI ( binds AP - 2 and AP - 3 but not syntenin ) or CD63 - AEMV , which lacks an 373 endocytosis signal . These cells , together with FtetZ / CD63 - / - cells and FtetZ / CD63 - / - : : TRE3G - CD63 374 cells , were then grown in normal medium , chilled , stained with antibodies , and examined by flow 375 cytometry . In the uninduced state , the cell surface abundance of CD63 proteins was determined by 376 the sequence of their C - terminal endocytosis signal , with the non - endocytosed CD63 - AEMV 377 protein accumulating at the plasma membrane at levels that were 10 - fold higher than that of WT 378 CD63 and 20 - fold higher than that of CD63 - YQRF or CD63 - YQTI ( Fig . 5E ) . These results indicate 379 that this baseline level of CD63 - Yxx F protein expression was too low to saturate AP - 2 and inhibit 380 their endocytosis . In support of this interpretation , the cell surface levels of Lamp1 , Lamp2 , CD81 , 381 and CD9 were the same in FtetZ / CD63 - / - cells and in each of the four CD63 - expressing cell lines 382 ( Fig . 5F - I ) . 383 384 In parallel with these studies , we also performed flow cytometry on doxycycline - induced cell 385 cultures as a way assess the impact of increasing the expression of CD63 . These experiments 386 revealed that high level expression led to the plasma membrane accumulation of all four forms of 387 CD63 , with the cell surface abundance of CD63 - AEMV increasing by ~ 10 - fold while the cell 388 surface of CD63 - Yxx F proteins increased even more , ~ 20 - fold for WT CD63 and ~ 50 - fold for 389 CD63 - YQRF and CD63 - YQTI ( Fig . 5J ) . These results indicate that high level expression of CD63 - 390 Yxx F proteins had saturated the AP - 2 machinery . Consistent this interpretation , we found that cell 391 surface abundance of Lamp1 and Lamp2 were both increased in cells expressing high levels of WT 392 CD63 , CD63 - YQRF or CD63 - YQTI ( Fig . K , L ) , with cell surface Lamp1 increasing 2 - fold in cells 393 expressing WT CD63 or CD63 - YQTI and 5 - fold in cells expressing CD63 - YQRF , while cell 394 surface Lamp2 increased 20 - fold in cells expressing WT CD63 or CD63 - YQTI and 50 - fold in cells 395 expressing CD63 - YQRF . Flow cytometry also revealed that doxycycline - induced expression of all 396 four CD63 proteins reduced the plasma membrane abundance of both CD81 and CD9 by ~ 2 - fold 397 to 4 - fold , an effect that was unrelated to the presence of an AP - 2 - binding Yxx F motif ( Fig . 5M , 398 N ) , which might reflect a competition in the endoplasmic reticulum - to - plasma membrane 399 trafficking of exosomal tetraspanins . 400 401 To determine whether the plasma membrane accumulation of CD63 , Lamp1 , and Lamp2 bore any 402 relation to their exosomal secretion from the cell , we collected cell and exosome fractions from 403 uninduced and induced cell cultures , then interrogated them by immunoblot . In uninduced cells , the 404 differences in plasma membrane abundance between WT CD63 , CD63 - YQRF , CD63 - YQTI , and 405 CD63 - AEMV accurately predicted their relative loading into exosomes , as the form of CD63 that 406 lacks an endocytosis signal ( CD63 - AEMV ) displayed the highest exosomal secretion , CD63 - YQRF 407 and CD63 - YQTI displayed the lowest degree of exosomal secretion , and WT CD63 displayed an 408 intermediate level of exosomal secretion , presumably because its endocytosis signal is masked by 409 syntenin ( Fig . 5O ) . These cells displayed little if any exosomal secretion of either Lamp1 or Lamp2 , 410 consistent with the flow cytometry data showing that their cell surface expression was unaffected 411 by the baseline level of CD63 protein expression . In contrast , doxycycline - induced expression led 412 to the efficient exosomal secretion of all four CD63 proteins , regardless of whether they did or did 413 not carry a functional endocytosis signal ( Fig . 5P ) . Furthermore , we found that high - level 414 expression of WT CD63 , CD63 - YQRF , or CD63 - YQTI induced a dramatic increase in the 415 exosomal secretion of Lamp1 and Lamp2 , providing yet more evidence that high - level expression 416 of CD63 inhibits AP - 2 - mediated endocytosis , and that plasma membrane accumulation is a 417 precursor to exosomal secretion . 418 419 Co - regulation of syntenin , CD63 , and the plasma membrane biogenesis of CD63 exosomes 420 CD63 expression varies from > 3 , 000 normalized transcripts per million ( nTPM ) in airway epithelial 421 cells to less than 10 nTPMs in neurons ( Table S1 ) ( 51 ) , marking CD63 as one of the most highly 422 expressed genes and also one of the most variably expressed human genes . This raises the question 423 of how cells manage CD63’s expression - dependent inhibition of AP - 2 - mediated endocytosis . One 424 potential mechanism is that cells coordinately express both CD63 and syntenin , a scenario that 425 would allow syntenin to suppress CD63’s inhibition of AP - 2 . In support of this hypothesis , we 426 found that CD63 and syntenin displayed a strong positive correlation in expression across 44 427 distinct sets of normal and cancer tissues ( Fig . S9 ) . This coordinate expression was also evident at 428 the protein level , as syntenin expression was highest in SK - MEL - 5 cells ( 2373 nTPM ) , moderate 429 in 293 cells ( 249 nTPM ) , and lowest in Daudi cells ( 87 nTPM ) ( Table S1 , Fig . 6A ) . 430 431 Given that high - level expression of either syntenin or CD63 inhibit CD63’s endocytosis and induce 432 its plasma membrane accumulation and exosomal secretion , the high - level expression of both CD63 433 and syntenin in SK - MEL - 5 cells predicts that this cell line should display significantly higher cell 434 surface accumulation and exosomal secretion of CD63 than 293F cells . Flow cytometry confirmed 435 the first half of this prediction , as SK - MEL - 5 cells accumulated CD63 to nearly 10 - times the level 436 seen in 293F cells , even though both cell lines had similar levels of cell surface CD81 and CD9 437 ( Fig . 6B ) . Furthermore , when we collected cell and exosome fractions from SK - MEL - 5 and 293F 438 cells and interrogated them by immunoblot , we found that SK - MEL - 5 cells loaded CD63 into 439 exosomes at ~ 6 - fold higher efficiency than 293F cells ( Fig . 6C , D ) , nearly the same increase in 440 exosomal secretion that we observed for CD63 proteins lacking their endocytosis signal ( 3 , 4 ) . 441 442 443 Discussion 444 445 The results presented here show that syntenin’s primary role in exosome biogenesis is to inhibit 446 CD63 endocytosis , drive the plasma membrane accumulation of CD63 , and thereby induce its 447 loading into plasma membrane - derived exosomes . In support of these conclusions , we also showed 448 that endocytosis is generally antagonistic to the exosomal secretion of exosome cargo proteins , that 449 inhibitors of endocytosis are sufficient to induce the plasma membrane accumulation and exosomal 450 secretion of CD63 , and that high - level expression of CD63 inhibits AP - 2 - mediated endocytosis and 451 induces the plasma membrane accumulation and exosomal secretion of CD63 and other lysosome 452 membrane proteins , including Lamp1 and Lamp2 . Furthermore , we showed that the indirect 453 mechanism of syntenin - induced CD63 budding was independent of Alix . Taken together , these data 454 support and extend the shared , stochastic hypothesis of exosome biogenesis ( 3 , 4 , 6 ) in which 455 exosome cargo proteins bud along the continuum of plasma and endosome membranes , though 456 primarily from the plasma membrane ( Fig . 7 ) . 457 458 Exosome cargo proteins bud primarily from the plasma membrane 459 Exosome cargo proteins bud best when they are localized to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 7i ) . This 460 was facet of exosome biogenesis was first demonstrated by us in 2011 in the T - cell leukemia cell 461 line Jurkat ( 31 , 33 ) , and more conclusively by us again in 2019 ( 4 ) and 2022 ( 3 ) in the human non - 462 cancerous cell line HEK293 , the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 , and in human primary 463 fibroblasts , and then again in this report in 293F cells , NIH3T3 cells , Hela cells , and SK - MEL - 5 464 cells . Furthermore , the empirical support for this conclusion includes a wide array of experimental 465 observations , including the fact that plasma membrane - localized exosome cargoes like CD81 and 466 CD9 are secreted from the cell in exosomes at far greater efficiency than endocytosed cargoes like 467 CD63 , that inhibition of CD63’s endocytosis by syntenin is sufficient to induce CD63’s plasma 468 membrane accumulation and exosomal secretion , that other inhibitors of endocytosis are also 469 sufficient to induce the selective plasma membrane accumulation and exosomal secretion of CD63 , 470 that appending endocytosis signals to CD9 dramatically reduce its exosomal secretion , that 471 removing the endocytosis signal from CD63 dramatically induced its exosomal secretion , and that 472 inhibiting AP - 2 - mediated endocytosis also induced the plasma membrane accumulation and 473 exosomal secretion of Lamp1 and Lamp2 . 474 475 Endocytosis inhibits the exosomal secretion of exosome cargo proteins 476 In addition to its direct empirical support , the primary role of the plasma membrane in exosome 477 biogenesis is consistent with the fact that the plasma membrane has an immense surface area ( ~ 2000 478 µ m 2 ) , that every plasma membrane vesicle budding event generates an exosome , and that ( Fig . 7ii ) 479 endocytosis inhibits the exosomal secretion of exosome cargo proteins . The evidence for the 480 antagonistic effect of endocytosis on exosome biogenesis is extensive , and includes the reduced 481 exosomal secretion in cells knocked out for syntenin , the reduced exosomal secretion of CD9 - YxxF 482 proteins , and the reduced exosomal secretion of CD63 - Yxx F proteins . Furthermore , this paper also 483 established that ( Fig . 7iii ) inhibitors of endocytosis induce the plasma membrane accumulation and 484 exosomal secretion of CD63 , a result we observed for cells expressing high levels of syntenin , 485 mutated in AP2M1 , incubated with latrunculin , or expressing AP - 2 - inhibiting levels of CD9 - YxxF 486 proteins or CD63 . Furthermore , these relationships between endocytosis , inhibition of endocytosis , 487 plasma membrane accumulation , and exosomal secretion were also evident in the behavior of 488 Lamp1 and Lamp2 in cells that expressed AP - 2 - inhibiting levels of CD63 . 489 490 Fates of endocytosed exosome cargo proteins 491 Under our working hypothesis of exosome biogenesis ( Fig . 7 ) , endocytosis of an exosome cargo 492 protein leads to ( Fig . 7iv ) its delivery to the limiting membrane of endosomes , ( Fig . 7v ) its loading 493 into nascent intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) , and in most cases , ( Fig . 7vi ) its ILV - mediated delivery 494 to lysosomes , and subsequent destruction . This canonical , plasma membrane - to - lysosome 495 trafficking pathway appears to explain the fate of endocytosis signal - containing forms of CD9 , as 496 these proteins were only detectable when the pathway was inhibited , either by addition of the V - 497 ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin or by saturating inhibition of AP - 2 induced by the high - level 498 expression of these CD9 - Yxx F proteins . In contrast to CD9 , endocytosis of CD63 was not 499 correlated with its efficient turnover , and thus , the plasma membrane - to - lysosome trafficking of 500 different exosome cargo proteins appears to proceed at distinct efficiencies . As for the mechanistic 501 basis of these differences , we do not currently know . However , some possibilities are that CD63 502 may be delivered to endosomes that are more refractory to fusion with lysosomes , and / or that CD63 , 503 as one of the most abundant lysosome membrane proteins known , is particularly resistant to 504 lysosomal proteases . 505 506 Regardless of these differences , there is no doubt that the plasma membrane - to - lysosome 507 trafficking pathway is multi - step , slow , and saturable . This results in the presence of a steady - state 508 stockpile of yet - to - be - degraded ILVs , some or all of which can be ( Fig . 7vii ) released as exosomes 509 whenever an ILV - containing endosome or lysosome fuses with the plasma membrane . In the 510 present paper , our experiments were designed to detect the exosomal secretion of cargo proteins by 511 this endocytosis / exocytosis route of exosome biogenesis , but in all cases our data indicated that its 512 contribution to exosome biogenesis was minimal ( Table S2 ) . This endocytosis / exocytosis pathway 513 of exosome biogenesis can , however , be induced by any of several triggers of endolysosomal 514 exocytosis , including activators of cytoplasmic calcium ( plasma membrane tears , ionomycin , 515 etc . ( 52 ) ) , lysosome poisons ( e . g . bafilomycin A ( 53 ) ) , virus - encoded de - acidifying proteins ( 54 ) , and 516 mutational inactivation of genes required for endosome - lysosome fusion ( e . g . VPS39 ( 55 ) ) . Less 517 clear is whether the increased exosomal secretion induced by these triggers is coming primarily 518 from ILV secretion or by increased exosome budding directly from the plasma membrane . 519 520 Relevance to exosome engineering 521 In addition to being the simplest explanation of the available data ( Table S2 and ( 3 ) ) , the shared , 522 stochastic model of exosome biogenesis ( Fig . 7 ) , and particularly its foundational observation that 523 the most highly - enriched exosome cargoes all bud best when localized to the plasma membrane ( 3 , 524 4 , 6 , 11 , 31 , 33 ) , draw a clear and simple roadmap for exosome engineering . In brief , this roadmap 525 shows that nearly any protein can be loaded into exosomes by maximizing just three variables : its 526 expression , its delivery to the plasma membrane , and its loading into nascent , plasma membrane 527 budding vesicles . As for whether it’s possible to engineer highly expressed proteins into and 528 through the endocytosis / exocytosis route of exosome biogenesis , our data indicate that it’s unlikely , 529 in part because endocytosed cargoes are destroyed by the plasma membrane - to - lysosome 530 trafficking pathway , and in part because high - level expression of an endocytosis signal - containing 531 cargo will block its endocytosis and induce its direct budding from the plasma membrane . In short , 532 any attempt to engineer the endocytosis / exocytosis pathway will undermine its own goals , induce 533 cargo budding from the plasma membrane , and likely disrupt exosome content further by inducing 534 the plasma membrane accumulation of otherwise endocytosed proteins . 535 536 Implications for CD63 - based models of exosome biology 537 In addition to their implications for exosome biogenesis , our data reveal a previously unrecognized 538 flaw in studies that make use of CD63 overexpression ( 11 , 56 - 66 ) . Specifically , we demonstrated 539 that high - level expression of CD63 inhibits its own endocytosis , inhibits the endocytosis of other 540 proteins , drives its direct budding from the plasma membrane , and drives the aberrant exosomal 541 secretion of Lamp1 , Lamp2 , and likely other AP - 2 - binding proteins as well . Not surprisingly , 542 evidence for this can be seen in the data of some earlier papers . For example , the CD63 - induced 543 inhibition of AP - 2 - mediated endocytosis and resulting exosomal secretion of CD63 , Lamp1 , 544 Lamp2 , and CD9 is also evident in the data of Mathieu et al . ( 11 ) , which reported that high - level 545 expression of CD63 led to its co - budding from the cell with the plasma membrane marker CD9 , 546 and also induced the exosomal secretion of Lamp1 and Lamp2 . Furthermore , the previously 547 unexplained lethality of CD63 - GFP transgenic mice ( 56 ) takes on greater significance , as it adds 548 independent genetic evidence that CD63 overexpression systems have unintended and adverse 549 effects on cells and animals . In light of these considerations , we urge caution when using CD63 - 550 based experimental models ( 11 , 56 - 66 ) , and recommend instead the use of models based on the 551 more highly - enriched and non - endocytosed cargoes CD81 and CD9 . 552 553 Mechanism and logic in exosome nomenclature 554 In contrast to the shared , stochastic model of exosome biogenesis ( Fig . 7 ) , others have proposed 555 that CD63 exosomes are generated exclusively by endocytosis / exocytosis route of exosome 556 biogenesis ( 11 - 23 ) . Proponents of this ‘endosome - dependent’ hypothesis also assert that it’s 557 possible to tell the difference between exosome - sized vesicles that are generated by direct budding 558 from the plasma membrane versus those that arise by endocytosis / exocytosis , and moreover , that 559 these two classes of vesicles should be referred to with different names 560 561 The data presented here refute all three of these assertions . In experiment after experiment , our data 562 support the shared , stochastic hypothesis of exosome biogenesis ( Fig . 7 ) and argue strongly against 563 the idea that exosomes are made solely or even primarily by the endocytosis / exocytosis pathway 564 ( Table S2 ) . Furthermore , the data presented here and in previous reports ( 3 , 4 ) shows definitively 565 that exosome cargo proteins bud from plasma and endosome membranes in exosomes of the same 566 size , topology and overlapping set of proteins . Thus , there is no way to determine where an exosome 567 arose once it has left the cell , and therefore no rational basis for a dichotomous nomenclature that 568 pretends what cannot be done . We therefore urge the EV field to adopt a definition of exosomes 569 that can be experimentally defined , such as small secreted vesicles of ~ 30 - 150 nm that have the 570 same topology as the cell and are enriched in exosome cargo proteins ( 6 , 67 , 68 ) . This simple 571 definition accurately reflects the underlying biology of exosome cargo protein trafficking and 572 exosome biogenesis , respects the fact that the origin membrane of individual exosomes cannot be 573 determined , and is consistent with the complex interactions between exosome protein budding , 574 exosome biogenesis , endocytosis , lysosomal protein trafficking and endolysosomal exocytosis 575 ( Fig . 7 ) . 576 577 Materials and Methods 578 579 Plasmids 580 The plasmid pJM1463 is based on a pS series plasmid ( 69 ) and carries a bicistronic ORF encoding 581 rtTAv16 - 2a - BleoR downstream of the spleen focus forming virus ( SFFV ) transcriptional control 582 region . The plasmids pYA128 , YA129 , and pYA130 are Sleeping Beauty transposons based on 583 pITRSB ( 69 ) that carry two genes : ( i ) an EFS - PuroR gene and ( ii ) a TRE3G regulated gene designed 584 to express syntenin , D N100syntenin , or syntenin D C23 , respectively . The plasmids pCG606 , 585 pCG732 , pCG733 , pCG734 , and pCG607 are Sleeping Beauty transposons based on pITRSB that 586 carry two genes : ( i ) an EFS - HygR gene and ( ii ) a TRE3G regulated gene designed to express codon 587 optimized CD9 ORFs that encode WT CD9 , CD9 - YQRF , CD9 - YQTI , CD9 - AEMV , and CD9 - 588 YEVM , respectively . The plasmids pCG602 , pMG9 , pCG604 , and pMG10 are Sleeping Beauty 589 transposons based on pITRSB that carry two genes : ( i ) an EFS - HygR gene and ( ii ) a TRE3G 590 regulated gene designed to express codon optimized ORFs that encode WT CD63 , CD63 - YQRF , 591 CD63 - YQTI , and CD63 - AEMV . All genes were synthesized in vitro , cloned into the appropriate , 592 expression vectors , and then sequenced in their entirety to ensure the absence of unwanted 593 mutations . 594 595 The plasmid used for knockout of the SDCBP gene , pJM1087 , was based on pFF ( 3 ) and contains 596 three genes . The first of these consists of a CMV promoter driving expression of a single long 597 quadricistronic ORF that encodes ( i ) Cas9 - 3xNLS , ( ii ) a viral 2a peptide , ( iii ) EGFP , ( iv ) another 598 viral 2a peptide , ( v ) the thymidine kinase ( tk ) from herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) , ( vi ) another viral 599 2a peptide , and ( vii ) the puromycin resistance protein PuroR ( 69 ) , with the ORF flanked by a pair 600 of loxP sites . The second of these genes consists of the PolIII - transcribed H1 promoter diving 601 expression of a Cas9 gRNA with the target sequence of 5’ - ATAAACCTACTTCCATCGTG - 3’ , 602 which is complementary to a sequence in the second coding exon of the SDCBP gene . The third of 603 these genes consists of the PolIII - transcribed 7sk promoter diving expression of a Cas9 gRNA with 604 the target sequence of 5’ - GGTTTCTGGTGCACCACTTC - 3’ , which is complementary to a 605 sequence in the third coding exon of the SDCBP gene . 606 607 Plasmids carrying genomic DNA ( gDNA ) amplification products from mutant cell lines were 608 generated by extracting gDNA from single cell clones , amplifying small fragments of the genome 609 surrounding the targeted site , using Taq polymerase . The resulting PCR fragments were checked 610 for proper size , then inserted into a bacterial cloning vector by ( A3600 , Promega ) . 611 612 Cell lines , transfections , and small molecules 613 293F were obtained from Thermo ( A14528 ) . SK - MEL - 5 cells , Daudi cells , NIH3T3 , an Hela - S 614 cells were obtained from ATCC ( HTB 70 , CCL - 213 , CRL - 1658 , and CCL - 2 . 2 , respectively ) . The 615 HEK293 Alix - / - cell line was described previously ( 3 ) , as was the 293F / CD63 - / - cell line ( 50 ) . The 616 293F / AP2M1 - / - cell line , 293F / CD9 - / - / - cell line , and 293F / SDCBP - / - cell line were generated in this 617 report ( see section below describing Cas9 - mediated gene editing ) . Adherent cultures were grown 618 in tissue culture plates in complete medium ( DMEM , 10 % fetal bovine serum , 1 % 619 penicillin / streptomycin ) at 37 o C , 90 % humidity , and 5 % CO 2 . For suspension cultures of 293F and 620 293F - derived cell lines , cells were grown in Freestyle medium ( Thermo ) in Erlenmeyer shaker 621 flasks at 110 rpm , 37 o C , 90 % humidity , and 8 % CO 2 . DNA transfections were performed using 622 Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Zeocin was used at 200 ug / mL . 623 Puromycin was used at 3 ug / mL . Doxycycline was used at 10 ng / mL . Latrunculin A was used at 1 624 uM . Bafilomycin A was used at 100 nM . 625 626 To create the doxycycline - inducible Tet - on cell lines ( i . e . FtetZ , 3TetZ , StetZ , HtetZ / Alix - / - , 627 FtetZ / CD63 - / - , and FtetZ / CD9 - / - / - ) , the parental cell lines ( 293F , NIH3T3 , Hela - S , HEK293 / Alix - / - , 628 293F / CD63 - / - , and 293F / CD9 - / - / - , respectively ) were transfected with pJM1463 using Lipofectamine 629 3000 ( Thermo ) . Two days later , the transfected cell populations were placed in zeocin - containing 630 media . The culture medium was changed every 3 - 4 days for 7 - 12 days to select for zeocin - resistant 631 cells . The thousands of surviving single cell clones from each transfection were then pooled to 632 generate a single polyclonal Tet - on derivative of each parental cell line . 633 634 To create the cell lines that express the syntenin proteins , FtetZ , 3TetZ , StetZ , and HtetZ / Alix - / - 635 cells were transfected with pYA128 , YA129 , and pYA130 . Two days later the cells were placed in 636 puromycin - containing media , followed by selection of puromycin - resistant clones and pooling of 637 all clones to create polyclonal cell lines designed for the doxycycline - induced expression of 638 syntenin proteins . To create the cell lines that express CD9 proteins , FtetZ / CD9 - / - / - cells were 639 transfected with pCG606 , pCG732 , pCG733 , pCG734 , and pCG607 . Two days later the cells were 640 placed in hygromycin - containing media , followed by selection of hygromycin - resistant clones and 641 pooling of all clones to create polyclonal cell lines designed for the doxycycline - induced expression 642 of CD9 proteins . To create the cell lines that express CD63 proteins , FtetZ / CD63 - / - cells were 643 transfected with pCG602 , pMG9 , pCG604 , and pMG10 . Two days later the cells were placed in 644 hygromycin - containing media , followed by selection of hygromycin - resistant clones and pooling 645 of all clones to create polyclonal cell lines designed for the doxycycline - induced expression of 646 CD63 proteins . 647 648 sEV preparation 649 For suspension cell cultures , cells were seeded into 30 ml of Freestyle medium at a density of 1 x 650 10 ^ 6 cells per ml and grown for 48 - 72 hours , with shaking . Culture media was collected and cells 651 and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 5 , 000 g at 4 o C for 15 minutes and by passage of 652 the resulting supernatant through a 200 nm pore size diameter filtration unit . To collect sEVs by 653 size exclusion chromatography and filtration , the 200 nm filtrate was concentrated ~ 100 - fold by 654 centrifugal flow filtration across a 100 kDa pore size diameter filter ( Centricon - 70 , 655 MilliporeSigma ) , followed by purification by size exclusion chromatography using qEV nano 656 columns ( Izon Sciences ) . 657 658 For adherent cell cultures , 6 million cells were seeded onto 150 mm dishes in 30 ml of complete 659 medium , allowed to adhere to the plates overnight , then incubated for three days in complete 660 medium . Culture media was collected and cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 661 5 , 000 g at 4 o C for 15 minutes and by passage of the resulting supernatant through a 200 nm pore 662 size diameter filtration unit . The sEVs were then collected by differential centrifugation , 663 supernatants were spun for 30 minutes at 10 , 000 x g , spun a second time for 30 minutes at 10 , 000 664 x g , then spun at 100 , 000 g for 2 hours , all at 4 o C . The supernatant was discarded and the sEV pellet 665 was resuspended for further analysis . 666 667 Immunoblot 668 Cells were lysed in Laemmli / SDS - PAGE sample buffer lacking reducing agent . Samples were 669 either maintained in reducing agent - free sample buffer or adjusted to 5 % ß - mercaptoethanol , then 670 heated to 100 o C for 10 minutes , spun at 13 , 000 x g for 2 minutes to eliminate insoluble material , 671 then separated by SDS - PAGE and processed for immunoblot as previously described using 672 antibodies specific for human CD63 ( NBP2 - 32830 , NOVUS ) , mouse CD63 ( NVG - 2 , Biolegend ) , 673 CD9 ( 312102 , Biolegend ) , CD81 ( 555675 , BD Biosciences ) , Hsp90 ( sc - 13119 , Santa Cruz 674 Biotechnology ) , syntenin ( PA5 - 76618 , Thermo ) AP2M1 ( 68196 , Cell Signaling Technologies ) , 675 Lamp1 ( H4A3 , Thermo ) , and Lamp2 ( H4B4 , Thermo ) . HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies were 676 from Jackson ImmunoResearch . 677 678 qRT - PCR 679 Total RNA was isolated using Quick - RNA Microprep Kit ( Zymo Research ) . RNA was converted 680 to single stranded cDNA by reverse - transcription using the High - Capacity RNA - to - cDNA Kit 681 ( Applied Biosystems ) . qPCR analysis was performed using SYBR Green master mix ( Bio - Rad ) 682 and the CFX96 Real - Time PCR Detection System ( Bio - Rad ) , with gene - specific primers for our 683 codon optimized syntenin transgene ( 5′ - GGCTCAAGTCTATTGATAATGGC - 3′ and 5′ - 684 CCTTATCACTGGACCAACC - 3′ ) , our CD9 transgene ( 5′ - 685 GAAATGTATTAAATATCTTCTGTTCGGTTT - 3′ and 5′ - 686 CCGGCACCGATAAGTATATAAAC - 3′ ) and control primers for human 18S rRNA ( 5′ - 687 CGGCGACGACCCATTCGAAC - 3′ and 5′ - GAATCGAACCCTGATTCCCCGTC - 3′ ) . Data was 688 analyzed with ΔΔCT Method . 689 690 Flow cytometry and fluorescence activated cell sorting 691 Cells were released by trypsinization ( TrypLE , Thermo ) and cell clumps were removed using a 692 cell - strainer ( Falcon Cat # 352235 ) . Approximately 500 , 000 cells were then concentrated by a brief 693 spin at 400 x g for 5 minutes and resuspended in 100 uL of 4 o C FACS buffer ( 1 % FBS in PBS ) 694 containing 2 uL of FITC - conjugated anti - CD63 ( clone H5C6 ) , 2 uL APC conjugated anti - CD9 695 ( clone H19a ) , 2 uL PE conjugated anti - CD81 ( clone 5A6 ) , or 2 uL PerCP conjugated anti - Lamp1 696 ( clone H4A3 ) and 2 uL PE conjugated anti - Lamp2 ( clone H4B4 ) , all from Biolegend , for 30 min 697 with gentle mixing every 10 min . Cells were washed 3 times with 1 mL of 4 o C FACS buffer , with 698 cells recovered by 400 x g spin for 4 min at 4°C . After the final wash , cells were resuspended in 699 FACS buffer with 0 . 5ug / ml DAPI , and analyzed using CytoFLEX S flow cytometer ( Beckman 700 Coulter ) . Flow cytometry histograms were generated using FlowJo ( v10 . 8 . 1 ) . For separation by 701 FACS , labeled cells were sorted into single cells in a 96 well plate , on the basis of high or low cell 702 surface labeling for CD63 or CD9 . 703 704 Cas9 - medited gene editing 705 To create the 293F / AP2M1 - / - cell line , we transfected 293F cells with a mixture of Cas9 protein 706 ( A36498 , Thermo ) and an AP2M1 - targeting single guide RNA ( sgRNA ; target sequence of 5’ - 707 ACGTTAAGCGGTCCAACATT - 3’ ) using lipofectamine CRISPRMAX ( Thermo ) . Cells were 708 cultured for several days , then seeded into wells of into 96 well plates at one cell per well . Single 709 cell clones ( SCCs ) were expanded , genomic DNA ( gDNA ) was extracted from each clone , and 710 each gDNA was interrogated by PCR using AP2M1 gene - specific primers . PCR products were 711 ligated into the pGEM® - T vector using a TA cloning kit ( A3600 , Promega ) , transformed into E . 712 coli , and 8 or more clones from each ligation were sequenced in their entirety . The 293F / AP2M1 - / - 713 cell line carried for further analysis carried one allele with a 198 bp deletion and one allele with a 714 = 1 codon deletion at a conserved position ( Ile63 D ) of the AP2M1 protein ( Fig . S5 ) . 715 716 A similar procedure was used to generate the 293F / CD9 - / - / - cell line . 293F cells were transfected 717 with a mixture of Cas9 protein ( A36498 , Thermo ) and a sgRNA guide RNA ( target sequence of 5’ - 718 ATTCGCCATTGAAATAGCTG - 3’ ) using lipofectamine CRISPRMAX ( Thermo ) . Cells were 719 cultured for several days , trypsinized , and seeded into wells of into 96 well plates at one cell per 720 well . Single cell clones were expanded , genomic DNA ( gDNA ) was extracted from each clone , and 721 each gDNA was interrogated by PCR using CD9 gene - specific primers . PCR products were ligated 722 into the pGEM® - T vector using a TA cloning kit ( A3600 , Promega ) , transformed into E . coli , and 723 24 or more clones from each ligation were sequenced in their entirety . All gDNA amplification 724 products from 293F / CD9 - / - / - cell lines carried up to three different sequences , indicating that 293F 725 cells carry three CD9 alleles . The cell line used for further experimentation carried one CD9 allele 726 with a 4 bp deletion and two CD9 alleles with the same 8bp deletion . ( Fig . S8 ) . 727 728 The 293F / SDCBP - / - cell line was created by transfecting 293F cells with the plasmid pJM1087 then 729 selecting for puromycin - resistant cell clones . After 7 days in selection , surviving cells were pooled , 730 with EGFP - positive cells separated by FACS into individual wells of a 96 well plate . The emergent 731 SCCs were expanded and 10 were interrogated by immunoblot using antibodies specific for 732 syntenin , revealing that all 10 lacked detectable level of syntenin protein . We then extracted gDNA 733 from these clones and interrogated each gDNA by PCR using primers flanking both gRNA target 734 sites in the SDCBP gene . The 293F / SDCBP - / - cell line selected carried deletions between the two 735 target sites in coding exons 2 and 3 on both of its SDCBP alleles rendering both functionally null . 736 To delete the Cas9 - EGFP - HSVtk - PuroR ORF , this cell line was transfected with a Cre recombinase 737 expression vector , grown for 10 days in CM lacking antibiotics , then seeded at various densities 738 into CM containing ganciclovir to eliminate any HSVtk - expressing cells . After growth and 739 selection for two weeks in ganciclovir - containing medium , the resulting cell clones were pooled 740 and examined by flow cytometry , revealing that all cells in the population were EGFP - negative . 741 Furthermore , exposure of these cells to puromycin confirmed that all of the cells in the ganciclovir - 742 resistant population had also reverted to puromycin sensitivity , and were therefore likely no longer 743 expressing Cas9 . 744 745 Endocytosis assay and confocal fluorescence microscopy 746 Cells were grown overnight on poly - D - lysine - coated coverglasses in CM , then transferred to pre - 747 chilled 4 o C CM . Cells were washed in 4 o C PBS , then incubated for 30 minutes at 4 o C with pre - 748 chilled 4 o C PBS ( 200 uL ) containing 4 uL FITC - conjugated anti - CD63 ( clone H5C6 , Biolegend ) 749 and 4 uL APC conjugated anti - CD9 ( clone H19a , Biolegend ) . Excess antibody was removed by 750 two washes with 4 o C PBS . Cells were then fixed immediately or transferred to CM at 37 o C and 751 incubated for 30 minutes at 37 o C . Fixation was with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBS for 20 minutes . 752 Cells were then incubated with DAPI to stain the nucleus , and then examined by confocal 753 fluorescence microscopy and imaged to assess the subcellular distribution of plasma membrane - 754 labeled CD63 and CD9 . Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM880 755 microscope with gallium - arsenide phosphide ( GaAsP ) detectors and a 63x / 1 . 4na Plan - Apochromat 756 objective . Images were assembled into figures using ImageJ and Adobe Illustrator . 757 758 SPIR - IFM analysis 759 Exosomes were purified by filtration and size exclusion chromatography , then further purified by 760 affinity capture on anti - CD81 or anti - CD9 antibodies that had been immobilized on SPIR imaging 761 chips ( Unchained Labs ) . Bound exosomes were then stained using CF - 647 conjugate of a mouse 762 anti - human CD63 monoclonal antibody ( Unchained Labs ) and imaged using an Exoview R200 763 imaging platform ( Unchained Labs ) . 764 765 qSMLM analysis 766 25 mm diameter coverslips # 1 . 5H ( Thermo Fischer Scientific , Cat # NC9560650 ; Waltham , MA , 767 USA ) were functionalized with N - hydroxysucciniamide ( NHS ) groups , followed by covalent 768 attachment of monoclonal antibodies that bind to epitopes in the ectodomain of human CD81 and 769 human CD9 . FtetZ cells and FtetZ : : syntenin cells were grown in Freestyle media containing 770 doxycycline , followed by collection of their exosomes by concentrating filtration and size exclusion 771 chromatography . The resulting exosome preparations were diluted in PBS containing 0 . 025 % 772 Tween 20 ( 1 : 50 ) to a final volume of 80 uL and placed on the surface of antibody - coated coverslips 773 at room temperature overnight in a humidified chamber . Coverslips were then washed with PBS 774 containing 0 . 025 % Tween 20 and EVs were labeled with a cocktail of AF647 - labeled antibodies 775 specific for human CD63 ( Novus Biologicals Cat . No . NBP2 - 42225 Centennial , CO , USA ) and 776 CF568 - labeled antibodies specific for human CD9 ( BioLegend , Cat . No . 312102 , San Diego , CA , 777 USA ) and human CD81 ( BioLegend , Cat . No . 349502 , San Diego , CA , USA ) . All antibodies were 778 fluorescently labeled as described previously at a molar ratio of ~ 1 ( 70 ) ) . Samples were fixed and 779 stored as described previously ( 71 , 72 ) . 780 781 For imaging , coverslips were placed in Attofluor cell chambers ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Cat . No . 782 A7816 ) loaded with direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( dSTORM ) imaging 783 buffer ( 73 ) . N - STORM super - resolution microscope ( Nikon Instruments ; Melville , NY , USA ) was 784 used for SMLM imaging using 561 nm and 640 nm lasers , respectively , using microscope 785 components described previously ( 74 ) . Images were acquired using NIS - Elements software ( Nikon 786 Instruments ) . SMLM images were processed using N - STORM Offline Analysis Module of the 787 NIS - Elements software to localize peaks as described before ( 71 ) . The localization data were 788 analyzed with the Nanometrix software ( version 1 . 0 . 4 . 61 ; Nanometrix Ltd , Oxford , UK ) using a 789 density - based spatial clustering of applications with noise ( DBSCAN ) algorithm . Prior to cluster 790 analysis , the detected 640 nm and 561 nm channel localizations were aligned using the Uniform 791 Dual Channel Alignment tool of Nanometrix . The DBSCAN - based cluster identification was 792 performed at a neighbor search radius of 30 nm and minimum points per cluster of 30 as analysis 793 conditions . Post - processing of the detected cluster data , including concatenation and filtering , was 794 performed using Matlab ( version R2022a ; MathWorks ; Natick , MA , USA ) . Clusters were identified 795 as EVs considering the following constraints . In the case of the 647 nm channel , the minimum and 796 maximum number of localizations per cluster was set to 30 and 3000 , as well as the minimum and 797 maximum diameter was set to 20 nm and 400 nm , respectively . In the case of the 561 nm channel , 798 the minimum and maximum number of localizations per cluster was set to 40 and 3200 , as well as 799 the minimum and maximum diameter was set to 30 nm and 400 nm , respectively . Colocalized 800 ( CD63 + , CD81 / CD9 + ) EVs were identified as overlapping clusters detected in the 640 nm and 561 801 nm channel . The number of tetraspanin molecules per exosome was calculated using an average of 802 15 ( 647 nm channel ) and 16 ( 561 nm channel ) localizations per single fluorescent tetraspanin 803 antibody , as described before ( 75 ) . Following EV identification , the EV count per region of interest 804 ( ROI ) , CD63 molecule count per EV , and EV diameter were further analyzed . To account for the 805 difference in EV concentration across the samples , we normalized the number of detected CD63 + , 806 CD81 / CD9 + and CD63 - , CD81 / CD9 + EVs by the total number of CD81 / CD9 + EVs . Statistical 807 significances in the normalized EV count per ROI data were determined using Brown - Forsythe and 808 Welch ANOVA test . Statistical significance in the CD63 molecule count per EV and diameter data 809 was assessed performing two - tailed Welch’s t - test after logarithmic transformation . Statistical 810 analysis and graph generation were performed in GraphPad Prism ( version 9 . 5 . 1 ; GraphPad , San 811 Diego , CA , USA ) . 812 813 Analysis of RNAseq data 814 The web tool ‘AnalyzeR’ was used to analysis RNA expression data of CD63 and SDCBP in 815 > 230 , 00 distinct samples that had been examined from normal and malignant human tissues , as 816 previously described ( 76 ) . 817 818 819 820 821 References 822 823 824 1 .

The shared , stochastic model of exosome biogenesis , updated . The plasma membrane 1214 is ( i ) the primary site of exosome biogenesis . Thus , the localization of exosome cargoes to the 1215 plasma membrane is a primary determinant of their exosomal secretion , which is why ( ii ) 1216 endocytosis is a potent inhibitor of a protein’s exosomal secretion . Under this model , any factor 1217 that ( iii ) inhibits the endocytosis of an exosome cargo will induce its exosomal secretion from the 1218 cell , which is why so many inhibitors of CD63 endocytosis induce its exosomal secretion from the 1219 cell ( mutation of AP2M1 , inhibition of actin polymerization , saturating inhibition of AP - 2 , etc . ) . 1220 This model also helps us understand the fate of endocytosed exosome cargo proteins , most of which 1221 are which are ( iv ) delivered to endosome membranes where they are ( v ) loaded into nascent ILVs . 1222 Many of these ILVs are ( vi ) delivered to lysosomes and destroyed by lysosomal hydrolases , 1223 completing a plasma membrane - to - lysosome degradative pathway . However , defects in endosome - 1224 lysosome fusion , blockade of lysosome hydrolases , repair of plasma membrane tears , or other 1225 inducers of endolysosomal exocytosis can ( vii ) result in ILV secretion . Although this 1226 endocytosis / exocytosis route of exosome biogenesis is commonly slow , saturable , and secondary 1227 to the plasma membrane route of exosome biogenesis , it can mediate an en bloc release of whatever 1228 stockpiles of ILVs happen to reside in the cell at any given time , and can lead to significant exosome 1229 release in response to specific signals . 1230 1231 1232 1233 1234
