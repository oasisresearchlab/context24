An important assumption underlying the hypothesized signalling value of carotenoid coloration is that there is a trade - off in carotenoid pigment allocation , such that not all individuals can meet the physiological / morphological demands for carotenoids ( i . e . carotenoids are limited ) and that only those who have abundant supplies or fewer demands become the most colourful . Studies of carotenoid trade - offs in colourful animals have been limited largely to domesticated species , which may have undergone artiﬁcial selection that changed the historical / natural immunomodulatory roles of carotenoids , to young animals lacking carotenoid - based signals or to species displaying carotenoid - based skin and bare parts . We studied the health beneﬁts of carotenoids during moult in house ﬁnches ( Carpodacus mexicanus ) , which display sexually selected , carotenoid - based plumage coloration . We manipulated dietary carotenoid availability during both winter ( nonmoult ) and autumn ( moult ) in captive males and females and found that carotenoid - supplemented birds mounted stronger immune responses ( to phytohemagglutinin injection and to a bacterial inoculation in blood ) than control birds only during moult . This study provides experimental , seasonal support for a fundamental tenet of Lozano’s ‘carotenoid trade - off’ hypothesis and adds to a growing list of animal species that beneﬁt immunologically from ingesting higher dietary carotenoid levels . © 2011 The Linnean Society of London , Biological Journal of the Linnean Society , 2011 , (cid:129)(cid:129) , •• – •• .

INTRODUCTION A variety of animal traits , including weaponry , elabo - rate vocalizations , and complex courtship displays , serve as honest , ‘condition - dependent’ indicators of mate attractiveness or competitive ability ( Maynard - Smith & Harper , 2003 ) . Behavioural ecologists have shown special interest of late in the proximate mecha - nisms that keep such signals honest ( Searcy & Nowicki , 2005 ) . Factors such as nutrition , health , and reproductive / energetic expenses are typically consid - ered to be limiting for maximal expression of such traits ( Griffith , Parker & Olson , 2006 ) . For many animal signals , it is not yet apparent how particular dietary , immunological or energy perturba - tions inﬂuence trait development ( Searcy & Nowicki , 2005 ) . Others , however , present a quite tractable system ( or ‘currency’ ) for quantifying units of signal expression and testing theories of honesty enforce - ment . One such example is the ornamental carotenoid coloration displayed by many birds and ﬁsh ( McGraw , 2006 ) . The carotenoid pigments used for coloration can be chemically traced from the diet , from which they must be acquired , and in the body , where they serve multiple functions ( e . g . immunomodulation , defence from solar radiation ) . Because of their many utilities , these colours have also emerged as ideal models for testing concepts in sexual selection in the context of life - history trade - offs ( Blount , 2004 ) . * Corresponding author .

With 4 ﬁgures © 2011 The Linnean Society of London , Biological Journal of the Linnean Society , 2011 , (cid:129)(cid:129) , •• – •• 1 Detailed studies of carotenoid pigmentation in animals such as guppies ( Poecilia reticulata ) and house ﬁnches ( Carpodacus mexicanus ) reveal that this form of coloration can be a reliable signal of dietary access to carotenoids ( Grether , Hudon & Millie , 1999 ; Hill , Inouye & Montgomerie , 2002 ) , general nutritional / energy state ( Nicoletto , 1991 ; Frischknecht , 1993 ; Hill , 2000 ) , and current health state ( Houde & Torio , 1992 ; Brawner , Hill & Sunder - mann , 2000 ; Horak et al . , 2004 ) . Two main production costs underlying signal honesty have been proposed : ( 1 ) carotenoids are limiting nutrients in the environ - ment ( Endler , 1983 ; for which there is now some support ; see above ) and ( 2 ) carotenoids are valuable antioxidants and modulators of immunity ( Burton & Ingold , 1984 ) . The latter observation led Lozano ( 1994 ) to advance his seminal ‘carotenoid trade - off’ hypothesis , namely that carotenoid - coloured animals are faced with the trade - off of allocating carotenoids to health versus coloration , and that only those animals with high carotenoid supplies can meet the demands of allocating pigments to both health and coloration . In recent years , this hypothesis has attracted much empirical and conceptual attention in the literature ( Shykoff & Widmer , 1996 ; Hartley & Kennedy , 2004 ; van Der Veen , 2005 ; Perez - Rodriguez , 2009 ) . A major thrust in this research and debate initially was whether individuals from any colourful species are ever limited in quantities of carotenoids needed to bolster immunity ( Hill , 1999 ; Lozano , 2001 ) . Subse - quently , carotenoids have been found to enhance immunity in animals with carotenoid - based sexual colours ( Blount et al . , 2003 ; Grether et al . , 2004 ) and evidence for a carotenoid trade - off between self - maintenance and coloration functions has emerged from several ﬁeld and laboratory studies of various bird and ﬁsh species ( Aguilera & Amat , 2007 ; Clot - felter , Ardia & McGraw , 2007 ; Alonso - Alvarez et al . , 2008 ; Baeta et al . , 2008 ) . However , not all studies support the carotenoid trade - off hypothesis ( Navara & Hill , 2003 ; Fitze et al . , 2007 ; Costantini & Møller , 2008 ; Lin et al . , 2010 ) and there are some taxonomic and logistical biases in previous work that may hinder our ability to draw broad conclusions . Studies largely have been con - ducted either on : ( 1 ) domesticated species ( McGraw & Ardia , 2003 ; Alonso - Alvarez et al . , 2004 ) , which have been subjected to a history of inbreeding and for which carotenoids may unnaturally boost health because of their artiﬁcially compromised immune system ; ( 2 ) young birds , which lack adult carotenoid ornamentation ( Fenoglio , Cucco & Malacarne , 2002 ; Saino et al . , 2003 ) or ( 3 ) animals with carotenoid - based bare parts ( e . g . skin , scales , beak ; Faivre et al . , 2003 ; McGraw & Ardia , 2003 ; Peters et al . , 2004 ; Perez - Rodriguez et al . , 2008 ) that can change colour rapidly ( Rosen & Tarvin , 2006 ; Velando , Beamonte - Barrientos & Torres , 2006 ) . By contrast to these emphases , much of the past work on carotenoid - based sexual signals has been performed on adults from free - living bird species with colourful plumage ( Johnson , Rosetta & Burley , 1993 ; Pryke , Lawes & Andersson , 2001 ; Hill , 2002 ) . Support for the ‘carotenoid trade - off’ hypothesis has largely come from observations that ( 1 ) providing supplemental carotenoids to animals boosts their health state or ( 2 ) carotenoid pigments or coloration decline in the face of an immune challenge or oxida - tive stress ( citations above ) . However , demonstrating a true molecule - speciﬁc trade - off under these circum - stances is not trivial ( Biard et al . , 2009 ) , especially when the tissue fate of pigments is not tracked ( i . e . using isotope labelling ) or when other processes that could be impacted by health state , such as food intake or pigment metabolism , are not monitored . Clearly , more quantitative and comparative approaches are needed to further test this ‘carotenoid trade - off’ hypothesis , particularly for avian plumage signals . At present , there is only mixed support for this idea in wild birds with sexually selected , carotenoid - pigmented plumage . Navara & Hill ( 2003 ) found no immunostimulatory role for xanthophyll carotenoids in male American goldﬁnches ( Carduelis tristis ) during feather growth , whereas Aguilera & Amat ( 2007 ) found that carotenoids enhanced immunity in male greenﬁnches ( Carduelis chloris ) that had just completed moult . One prediction that emerges from the ‘carotenoid trade - off’ hypothesis for birds with colourful plumage is that carotenoids may only be differentially limiting or beneﬁcial at the time of year when pigments are actively being used for coloration ( e . g . during moult ) . In other words , carotenoid allocation to feathers may render immune systems deﬁcient in and more likely to be aided by increased carotenoid supplies compared to other times of year . The fact that annual circulat - ing levels of carotenoids in wild house ﬁnches are lowest during moult also suggests greatest carotenoid limitations at this time ( Toomey & McGraw , 2009 ) . Hence , a test of seasonal variation in carotenoid immunomodulation may be informative for under - standing how and when carotenoids may play valu - able , limiting immunomodulatory roles . In the present study , we experimentally tested the relationship between carotenoids and immunity in nonmoulting and moulting captive house ﬁnches ( Carpodacus mexicanus ) . The variable red - to - yellow , carotenoid - based plumage of male house ﬁnches has served as a classic example of an honest signal of quality in animals ( Hill , 2002 ) . Surprisingly , despite all of the studies that have been performed on diet , 2 K . J . MCGRAW ET AL . © 2011 The Linnean Society of London , Biological Journal of the Linnean Society , 2011 , (cid:129)(cid:129) , •• – •• health , and coloration in house ﬁnches , including one in which males with redder plumage were found to show higher disease clearance rates ( Hill & Farmer , 2005 ) , no information is yet available on the relation - ship between systemic carotenoids and health per se in this species . At two different times of year ( winter and autumn ) , we manipulated naturally available xanthophyll carotenoids in the diet and examined their effect on two indices of immunocompetence ( bac - tericidal potency of whole blood and swelling response to a mitogen injection ) . We selected these two mea - sures of immunity because recent work in chickens ( Gallus gallus domesticus ; Selvaraj et al . , 2006 ) and other avian species ( see below ) suggests that they are especially sensitive to carotenoid status . The fact that we studied both males and females allowed us to test the possibility that males , who deposit more caro - tenoids into plumage than females and thus may be more carotenoid - limited ( for a given dietary intake ) , would experience greater health beneﬁts when given supplemental carotenoids during moult compared to females . MATERIAL AND METHODS G ENERAL CAPTURE AND TREATMENT OF BIRDS From 4 – 11 October 2004 , 16 male and 16 female house ﬁnches in adult plumage were captured in basket traps at established sunﬂower - seed feeder sta - tions on the campus of Arizona State University . Unlike the majority of work carried out on house ﬁnches ( from their introduced range in the eastern United States ) , these birds were captured from their native range , in the desert southwestern USA ( Hill et al . , 2002 ; Deviche & Cortez , 2005 ; Toomey & McGraw , 2009 ) . At capture , we banded each bird with a uniquely numbered metal leg ring , measured body mass to the nearest 0 . 01 g with an electronic balance , and scored plumage coloration using a Colortron II reﬂectance spectrophotometer ( Hill , 1998 ) . Hue and saturation were used as our measures of carotenoid coloration because they are the most variable , sexu - ally valuable , and repeatably quantiﬁable tristimulus colour scores in this species ; we averaged hue and saturation scores from duplicate readings taken on the rump in females and on the crown , breast , and rump in males to compute mean values for each animal ( Hill , 2002 ) . For the duration of the captive study , birds were housed in an Institutional Animal Care and Use Com - mittee approved , climate - controlled greenhouse room , under natural light conditions , and in male – female pairs within small wire cages ( for housing details , see McGraw , 2005 ) . We fed them a base , ad libitum diet of tap water and ZuPreem® AvianMaintenance™ Natural Premium Diet for Canaries and Finches ( Premium Nutritional Products Inc . ) . This pelleted diet contains a xanthophyll carotenoid content of 8 . 5 m g g - 1 ( McGraw , 2005 ) and minor amounts of b - cryptoxanthin and b - carotene ( < 1 m g g - 1 ; K . J . McGraw , unpubl . data ) . This represents just less than an average dietary carotenoid dose for moulting house ﬁnches , which acquire a mean of 12 m g g - 1 total caro - tenoids from their food ( range 0 . 5 – 80 m g g - 1 ) ( Hill et al . , 2002 ) . C APTIVE DIETARY CAROTENOID SUPPLEMENTATION EXPERIMENTS Birds were allowed an initial 6 – 7 weeks ( depending on their capture date ) to acclimate to the captive environment . Then , we randomly divided the birds into two groups of eight females and eight males each . Identical eight - week feeding experiments were then run in the winter ( 23 November 2004 to 20 January 2005 ) and the following autumn ( 26 July to 20 Sep - tember 2005 ) . One group ( control birds ) continued to consume the base food / water diet , whereas we added 0 . 158 g of lutein beadlets and 0 . 028 g of zeaxanthin beadlets to each litre of drinking water for the other group ( carotenoid - supplemented birds ) , which approximates the lutein : zeaxanthin ratio found in the plasma of moulting birds at our study site ( McGraw , Nolan & Crino , 2006a ) . This resulted in a supplemental dose in the drinking water ( 9 . 4 m g g - 1 ) that matched the total carotenoid concentration that treatment birds were receiving in their food . It is important to note that birds remained in the same treatment group during each experiment but , between experiments ( 20 January to 25 July ) , all birds were returned to the base , low - carotenoid diet . We did not ﬁnd carry - over effects of the ﬁrst ( winter ) feeding period on health or carotenoid status at the start of the second ( moult ) experiment ( see Results below ) . On the day before beginning each experiment , we weighed each bird as above and drew blood ( approxi - mately 150 m L from the alar vein ) to determine pre - experimental plasma carotenoid levels as well as the bactericidal potency of whole blood ( for procedures , see below ) . The latter is a newly emerging immune assay in vertebrates ( Tieleman et al . , 2005 ; Matson , Tieleman & Klasing , 2006 ) and one previously used by us to probe ( and conﬁrm ) the immune - enhancing properties of carotenoids in two avian species : red junglefowl ( Gallus gallus ; McGraw & Klasing , 2006 ) and society ﬁnch ( Lonchura domestica ; McGraw et al . , 2006b ) . This in vitro method explores the extent to which constitutive , innate immune mechanisms ( e . g . complement , leukocytes ) in blood can kill Escherichia coli bacteria . CAROTENOIDS BOLSTER IMMUNITY DURING MOULT 3 © 2011 The Linnean Society of London , Biological Journal of the Linnean Society , 2011 , (cid:129)(cid:129) , •• – •• Then , 7 . 5 weeks into the 8 - week supplementation period , we again weighed birds and drew blood for plasma - carotenoid and bacterial - killing assays . In the autumn experiment , this was carried out at a time ( in mid - September ) when birds had completed 64 ± 7 % ( mean ± SE ) of colourful plumage moult ( range 15 – 90 % ) . On the ﬁnal 2 days of carotenoid supple - mentation , we completed our second assay of health , comprising a commonly used mitogenic challenge with phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) that measures induc - ible adaptive immunity ( Smits , Bortolotti & Tella , 1999 ) . We and others have used this technique pre - viously to demonstrate carotenoid facilitation of the PHA response ( thickness of wing - web swelling ) in male zebra ﬁnches ( Blount et al . , 2003 ; McGraw & Ardia , 2003 ) . After moult was completed in the autumn experiment , we again scored plumage hue and saturation ( as above ) to determine the effect of dietary carotenoid supplementation on colour devel - opment . L ABORATORY ASSAYS OF CAROTENOIDS AND IMMUNITY Plasma carotenoid content Solvent - extraction and high - performance liquid chro - matography ( HPLC ) analytical methods follow those in McGraw et al . ( 2006a ) . Carotenoids were sequen - tially extracted from 10 m L thawed plasma with 100 m L each of ethanol and 1 : 1 hexane : tert - butyl methyl ether . We centrifuged the solution at 8000 r . p . m . for 4 min , transferred the supernatant to a fresh tube , evaporated it to dryness under a stream of nitrogen , and resuspended the pigment residue in 200 m L methanol . Pigment extracts were injected into a Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC system ﬁtted with a Waters YMC Carotenoid 5 . 0 m m column ( 4 . 6 ¥ 250 mm ) and a built - in column heater set at 30 °C . We used a three - step gradient solvent system to analyze both polar and nonpolar carotenoids in a single run , at a constant ﬂow rate of 1 . 2 mL min - 1 : ﬁrst , isocratic elution with 42 : 42 : 16 ( v / v / v ) metha - nol : acetonitrile : dichloromethane for 11 min , followed by a linear gradient up to 42 : 23 : 35 ( v / v / v ) metha - nol : acetonitrile : dichloromethane for 20 min , held isocratically at this condition until 28 min , and ﬁn - ishing with a return to the initial isocratic condition from 28 – 40 min . Data were collected from 250 – 600 nm using a Waters 2996 photodiode array detec - tor . We identiﬁed pigments by comparing their respective retention times and absorbance maxima ( l max ) to those of puriﬁed , reference carotenoids . Cir - culating carotenoid concentrations were determined by comparison with external standard curves for each pigment . We detected lutein , zeaxanthin , and b - cryptoxanthin as major plasma carotenoids , which is typical for this species ( McGraw et al . , 2006a ) . Bacterial - killing efficiency To 40 m L fresh whole blood that we collected within 10 min of entering the birds’ room and that we returned to the laboratory for analysis within 30 min of collection ( sensu Matson et al . , 2006 ) , we added 200 E . coli ( E power microorganisms ATCC # 8739 , 10 7 , MicroBioLogics ) suspended in medium ( CO 2 independent medium + 4 mM glutamine + 5 % heat - inactivated fetal calf serum ) to give a ﬁnal dilution of 1 : 10 . The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min , at which point we transferred 75 - m L aliquots of each sample to two 4 % tryptic soy agar plates , dispersed the solution homogenously across the plate with a sterile glass spreader , and incubated the plate over - night at 37 °C . We returned the next morning to count the number of bacterial colonies per plate and deter - mined killing efficiency ( % colonies killed ) relative to control plates prepared only with medium and E . coli . Killing efficiency was highly repeatable for our dupli - cate samples ( all R i > 0 . 95 ; sensu Lessells & Boag , 1987 ) from all four sampling periods ( pre - and post - treatment in winter and fall experiments ) , so we used averages in statistical analyses . Response to PHA injection We ﬁrst measured the thickness of the left patagium three times with a pressure - sensitive micrometer ( Mitutoya Inc . ) to the nearest 0 . 001 mm and then injected 50 m L of phosphate - buffered saline containing 0 . 25 mg PHA ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) into the left pat - agium of each bird ( sensu Deviche & Cortez , 2005 ) . We returned 24 h later to measure patagium thick - ness in the same fashion . Repeatability of patagium swelling ( calculated as post - pre patagium thickness ) was high both before and after injection in both experiments ( all R i > 0 . 8 ) , so again we used averages in statistical analyses . S TATISTICAL ANALYSIS For all variables , we tested the assumptions of para - metric statistics ( normality and homoscedasticity ) and rank transformed them ( Conover & Iman , 1981 ) when assumptions were violated . We ran repeated - measures analyses of variance ( rmANOVAs ) using sex , dietary carotenoid treatment , time , and their interactions as predictors of carotenoid accumulation and bacterial killing efficiency . We used two - way ANOVAs to test for diet , sex , and diet ¥ sex differ - ences in our single - time - point variables : plumage coloration ( pre - experiment in winter study , post - experiment in autumn molt study ) and post - experiment wing - web swelling . Note that our sample 4 K . J . MCGRAW ET AL . © 2011 The Linnean Society of London , Biological Journal of the Linnean Society , 2011 , (cid:129)(cid:129) , •• – •• size declined from 32 in the winter 2004 – 05 experi - ment to 26 in the autumn 2005 experiment ( six control females , ﬁve supplemented females , seven control males , eight supplemented males ) because of unexpected disease ( avian pox ) and mortality that occurred in the intervening spring and summer . No other birds in the present study showed signs of pox infection . Data are presented as the mean ± SE in all cases , and a - level was set to 0 . 05 throughout . RESULTS C AROTENOID SUPPLEMENTATION AND IMMUNITY DURING WINTER Before the experiment , treatment groups did not differ in plumage hue ( F 1 , 28 = 0 . 09 , P = 0 . 77 ) or satu - ration ( F 1 , 28 = 0 . 02 , P = 0 . 89 ) , nor were there any sig - niﬁcant sex ¥ diet interactions ( both P > 0 . 2 ) . We did , however , ﬁnd the expected sex differences in plum - age hue ( F 1 , 28 = 73 . 4 , P < 0 . 0001 ) and saturation ( F 1 , 28 = 92 . 9 , P < 0 . 0001 ) , with male plumage being redder and more saturated than that of females . We conﬁrmed that our dietary carotenoid manipu - lation created an experimental difference in caro - tenoids accumulated in the body , as demonstrated by the signiﬁcantly elevated levels of all carotenoids in the plasma of supplemented birds compared to con - trols , although only after the experiment ( i . e . the signiﬁcant diet ¥ time factors in Fig . 1 , Table 1 ) . Levels of all three carotenoids were highly positively correlated within a bird , even when we broke down analyses by sex and treatment group ( all r > 0 . 84 , all N = 8 , all P < 0 . 002 ) . Over the course of the experi - ment , supplemented males and females increased in total plasma carotenoid concentration by 63 ± 24 % and 132 ± 24 % , respectively , whereas plasma caro - tenoid levels slightly decreased in control males and females during this experiment ( - 1 ± 7 % and - 13 ± 8 % , respectively ) . Plasma carotenoid levels for all but two supplemented females ( that circulated 65 m g mL - 1 ) fell within the natural range of variation that we have previously detected at this time of year in our population of wild house ﬁnches ( 2 – 50 m g mL - 1 ) , and mean levels for control birds ( 14 . 8 m g mL - 1 ) closely approximated the average among free - ranging adults from November to January ( 14 . 2 m g mL - 1 , N = 115 ; K . J . McGraw , unpubl . data ) . There were no sex differences in plasma carotenoid levels in the experiment , nor diet ¥ sex interactions , although we did ﬁnd signiﬁ - cant diet ¥ sex ¥ time interactions for all three caro - tenoids , with plasma carotenoid concentrations increasing more over time in supplemented females than in supplemented males ( Fig . 1 , Table 1 ) . We found no effect of dietary carotenoid treatment ( F 1 , 28 = 0 . 04 , P = 0 . 85 ) , sex ( F 1 , 28 = 0 . 21 , P = 0 . 65 ) , or the diet ¥ sex interaction ( F 1 , 28 = 0 . 05 , P = 0 . 82 ) on wing - web swelling after the experiment ( Fig . 2A ) . Bacterial killing efficiency also was unaffected by diet , sex , time , or any interaction term ( Fig . 2B , Table 1 ) . Killing efficiency changed only slightly , decreasing by 3 % , over the course of the experiment ( pre - treatment = 90 . 8 ± 3 . 4 % ; post - treatment = 87 . 7 ± 3 . 5 % , for all birds combined ) . Even if we excluded the two females that circulated potentially unnatu - rally high levels of carotenoids through blood , there was still no health - enhancing effect of caro - tenoids for either immune measure ( all P > 0 . 3 ) .

We had high statistical power ( = 0 . 72 – 0 . 83 , at a = 0 . 05 ; Cohen , 1988 ) to detect the previously reported , strong effects of carotenoids on immunity in other studies on colourful adult birds ( r = 0 . 65 – 0 . 75 ; Blount et al . , 2003 ; McGraw & Ardia , 2003 ) , which used comparable sample sizes ( N = 10 per treatment group ) , as well as to detect those effects uncovered in the present study in autumn ( see below ) . C AROTENOID SUPPLEMENTATION , COLORATION , AND IMMUNITY DURING MOULT Our 8 - week carotenoid supplementation experiment during autumn was again effective in generating dif - ferences in circulating carotenoids between treatment groups , although it had different and more complex effects on pigment accumulation than during the pre - vious winter experiment .

CAROTENOIDS BOLSTER IMMUNITY DURING MOULT 7 © 2011 The Linnean Society of London , Biological Journal of the Linnean Society , 2011 , (cid:129)(cid:129) , •• – •• lated within individual birds , even when broken down by sex and treatment group ( all r > 0 . 94 , all P < 0 . 002 ) , although the concentrations of the carotenoid we did not supplement ( i . e . b - cryptoxanthin ) were not always signiﬁcant correlated with lutein or zeaxanthin titers ( r - values from 0 . 33 – 0 . 82 , P - values from 0 . 49 – 0 . 01 for the different treatment groups ) . b - cryptoxanthin con - centrations decreased to zero ( in 11 of 26 birds ) or nearly so during the study ( Fig . 3C , Table 2 ) . However , plasma carotenoid titres for no individuals in this experiment fell outside of the natural range of varia - tion observed in wild moulting house ﬁnches in the present study population ( 2 – 34 m g mL - 1 ; McGraw et al . , 2006a ) ; levels of total circulating carotenoids in one supplemented female reached the maximum ( 34 m g mL - 1 ) , although concentrations in all others were < 28 m g mL - 1 . Moreover , levels of b - cryptoxanthin were not pharmacologically low because 27 of 57 birds in our previous study of plasma carotenoids in wild moulting house ﬁnches circulated < 0 . 4 m g mL - 1 b - cryptoxanthin ( McGraw et al . , 2006a ) . Presumably , carotenoid levels generally declined in moulting birds as a result of depressed health ( see below ) and / or active carotenoid allocation to plumage , except in females ( who deposit fewer carotenoids into plumage than do males ) that received carotenoid supplements . The fact that there were no group differences in levels of any carotenoid type before the experiment indicates that there were no carry - over effects of the prior ( winter ) supplementation on carotenoid accumulation in the present study . We found no effect of carotenoid supplementation on the hue of newly moulted carotenoid - based plumage ( F 1 , 24 = 0 . 64 , P = 0 . 43 ) , although the sexes again differed signiﬁcantly ( F 1 , 24 = 8 . 98 , P = 0 . 007 ; sex ¥ treatment interaction : F 1 , 24 = 3 . 19 , P = 0 . 09 ) . The lack of an effect on hue was not surprising because all birds were fed a diet with very low b - cryptoxanthin levels and thus developed drab yellow plumage . However , we did ﬁnd a signiﬁcant treatment effect on plumage saturation ( F 1 , 24 = 5 . 58 , P = 0 . 028 ) , with carotenoid - supplemented birds developing more satu - rated ( 6 % more in males , 26 % in females ) yellow plumage than controls ; as expected , males also devel - oped more saturated plumage than females ( F 1 , 24 = 68 . 0 , P < 0 . 0001 ; sex ¥ treatment interaction : F 1 , 24 = 0 . 14 , P = 0 . 71 ) . Body mass did not differ signiﬁ - cantly as a function of diet , sex , or time , although there were signiﬁcant sex ¥ time and diet ¥ sex ¥ time interactions , such that supplemented females differed from the rest of the groups by losing , as opposed to gaining , mass ( Fig . 4A , Table 2 ) . Finches showed exceptionally high bacterial - killing efficiency just prior to moult ( 99 . 7 ± 0 . 09 % ) , indicating that birds were still in excellent health after spending more than 8 months in captivity . Moreover , we found no pre - experiment differences among groups in bacterial - killing efficiency of blood ( Fig . 4C ) , again pointing to no carry - over effects from the winter study . However , unlike the results of the winter experiment , we found that carotenoid supplementa - tion during moult enhanced both of our measures of Figure 4 .

First , there was a signiﬁcant effect of the diet treatment ¥ time interac - tion on bacterial - killing efficiency ( Table 2 ) . Although bacterial - killing efficiency declined substantially during moult ( down to 54 . 5 ± 5 . 5 % ; time effect in Table 2 ) , on average , supplemented females and males killed 26 % and 18 % , respectively , more bacte - rial colonies after the experiment than did control females and males ( Fig . 4B ) . Second , diet treatment had a strong effect on post - experiment wing - web swelling ( F 1 , 22 = 12 . 2 , P = 0 . 002 ) . Wing web thickness increased 62 % and 41 % more in response to PHA after the experiment in treatment males and females , respectively , compared to control groups of each sex ( Fig . 4C ) . There was no effect of sex ( F 1 , 22 = 1 . 73 , P = 0 . 20 ) or the sex ¥ treatment interaction ( F 1 , 22 = 0 . 70 , P = 0 . 41 ) on wing - web swelling . DISCUSSION Carotenoids serve as valuable antioxidants or immu - nomodulators in plants ( Bartley & Scolnik , 1995 ; Visoly - Fisher et al . , 2006 ) and animals ranging from humans ( Johnson , 2002 ) to commercially valuable crustacean , ﬁsh , bird , and other mammal species ( Chew & Park , 2004 ; Babin , Biard & Moret , 2010 ) . However , their role as limiting modulators of health in colourful birds has been debated ( Shykoff & Widmer , 1996 ; Hill , 1999 ; Hartley & Kennedy , 2004 ; Costantini & Møller , 2008 ) . We used a seasonal and experimental design to test the immunomodulatory properties of naturally occurring carotenoids in a wild songbird species that is classically known to use carotenoid - based plumage colour as an honest signal of nutrition and health ( Hill , 2002 ) . We found during the moult period that dietary carotenoid supplemen - tation enhanced the performance of house ﬁnches in two constitutive innate immune challenges , although this same effect was absent in the same birds under - going the same experimental manipulations during a nonmoulting ( winter ) period . This demonstration of moult - speciﬁc carotenoid immunomodulation lends experimental support to Lozano’s ( 1994 ) seminal ‘trade - off’ hypothesis for carotenoid - based colour signalling . The crux of his idea was that birds faced with devoting carotenoids to coloration are consequently limited in their ability to utilize carotenoids for becoming healthy , such that only those individuals with sufficiently high intake can satisfy the carotenoid requirements of both func - tions ; in the present study , we show that immuno - competence in adult animals from a wild bird species is constrained by carotenoid accumulation , and spe - ciﬁcally when carotenoids are being shunted to feath - ers for the development of sexual coloration . Admittedly , our support for this hypothesis is still somewhat limited . We did not test for carotenoid immunomodulation at all other times of year in house ﬁnches , which would be necessary to conclude that the immune - enhancing beneﬁts of high carotenoid supplies are reaped only during plumage moult . Moreover , our methods lacked the difficult but neces - sary molecule - speciﬁc tracking that would account for how pigments were speciﬁcally diverted to or traded - off for particular functions . For example , it is conceiv - able in the present study that carotenoids changed seasonally in their immunomodulatory properties not because carotenoids were lost directly to plumage in autumn , but simply because of alternate energetic stressors that occur during the moult period ( e . g . oxidative stress , nutrient demands for feather replacement itself , increase in parasitism ) . Moreover , ideally we would conduct these manipulations and measurements in wild birds experiencing natural nutritional and energetic conditions . Nonetheless , among the avian studies to date that have conﬁrmed carotenoid immunomodulation , the present study pro - vides the best experimental support in a wild bird species that carotenoids are limiting agents when pigments can be used for both health and colour acquisition . Moreover , the health beneﬁts of caro - tenoids have been understudied in female animals in this context ( McGraw & Ardia , 2005 ) and , in the present study , we demonstrate boosts in immunocom - petence to both sexes when provisioned with supple - mental carotenoids during moult . The molecular mechanisms by which carotenoids modulate immunity are poorly known in birds ( McGraw & Klasing , 2006 ) and even in mammals and humans ( Stahl , Ale - Agha & Polidori , 2002 ) . Antioxi - dant protection of cells and tissues in the body ( including metabolically active immune cells ) is most often cited ( Krinsky , 1989 ; Surai , 2002 ) but gene - regulatory , cell - signalling , and enzyme - inhibition mechanisms are receiving increased attention in the human - health literature ( Stahl et al . , 2002 ) . For our two measures of innate immunity , both of which probe standing immune performance over a short time course , it is quite plausible that carotenoids primarily acted as free - radical scavengers , protecting the leukocytes and complement in circulation from oxidative damage and hence serving in an immunop - ermissive fashion ( allowing the immune system to perform adequately when replete but inadequately when deplete ) . However , we are aware of no studies on carotenoids and health in wild animals that have simultaneously monitored these different immuno - modulatory mechanisms for carotenoids . Clearly , in future work , it will be key to account for as many of these as possible , not to mention additional measures of adaptive immunity , as we continue to shape our CAROTENOIDS BOLSTER IMMUNITY DURING MOULT 9 © 2011 The Linnean Society of London , Biological Journal of the Linnean Society , 2011 , (cid:129)(cid:129) , •• – •• understanding of how globally limiting carotenoids are for immune system functioning ( McGraw & Klasing , 2006 ) . In the present study , we manipulated yellow dietary xanthophylls , which are the two predominant carotenoids in ﬁnch diets ( McGraw et al . , 2006a ) and which clearly can be used for both coloration and health - boosting in birds ( Blount et al . , 2003 ; McGraw & Ardia , 2003 ) . However , the key molecular ingredi - ent for developing sexually attractive red coloration in house ﬁnches is b - cryptoxanthin , a more environmen - tally scarce , less polar , orange dietary carotenoid that is the substrate for production of red ketocarotenoids that appear in plumage ( Hill , 2000 ; Inouye et al . , 2001 ; McGraw et al . , 2006a ) ; without this carotenoid , birds consistently grow drab yellow plumage ( Hill , 2000 , 2002 ) . Because only circulating xanthophylls were affected by our dietary xanthophyll manipula - tion during the experiment ( in autumn ) in which we noted health beneﬁts of supplementation , we can only make reference in the present study to the health beneﬁts of added levels of these dietary carotenoids . b - cryptoxanthin was present at very low levels before moult and precipitously declined from circulation during the experiment , putatively as a result of its use as a precursor for plumage pigments . Because various carotenoid types ( e . g . xanthophylls versus carotenes ) can be differentially useful for health and coloration in birds ( Fitze et al . , 2007 ) , it will be valu - able in future studies to manipulate all possible dietary carotenoid types and combinations , to evalu - ate whether the important dietary precursor for red plumage development in house ﬁnches may in fact be limiting for health and coloration purposes . Finally , although our ﬁndings agree with those of Aguilera & Amat ( 2007 ) , the present study contrasts markedly with the other published experiment on carotenoids and immunity during moult in a wild passerine species for which a sexual signalling func - tion is known for carotenoid coloration . Navara & Hill ( 2003 ) studied captive , moulting American gold - ﬁnches ( a close relative of house ﬁnches ) and failed to detect any effect of dietary xanthophyll ( lutein + zeaxanthin ) supplementation on multiple measures of disease and immunity , including one used in the present study ( wing - web swelling ) . Methodological differences between the present study and theirs are many , including the duration of the carotenoid supplementation ( 3 months in their study ) , carotenoid dosages ( approximately six - fold greater than that supplemented in the present study ) , housing conditions of the birds ( they kept goldﬁnches in large groups in outdoor pens ) , and disease exposure ( they inoculated birds with two naturally occurring parasites during the second half of moult ) , all of which may have differentially impacted carotenoid intake and allocation in the two species . However , there is also the possibility that avian species genuinely differ in their immune sensitivities to carotenoids , with some experiencing fewer limitations or needs for them . Ecological pres - sures such as disease ( species , incidence , and viru - lence ) , moult ( timing , rate , and extent of feather replacement and carotenoid coloration ) , and caro - tenoid intake certainly vary among species , as well as among individuals in certain species . Now that we have several comparative frameworks in place for understanding interspeciﬁc variation in caro - tenoid intake , circulation , and coloration ( Tella et al . , 2004 ; McGraw , 2005 ; Olson & Owens , 2005 ; Olson , 2006 ; Cohen et al . , 2008 ) , it is time to begin ecoimmunological investigations aiming to supple - ment such rich databases with information on disease and immunity . In conclusion , we have uncovered carotenoid immu - nomodulation during plumage moult in a wild passe - rine bird with sexually selected carotenoid coloration . This demonstration in adult , colourful animals indi - cates that similar evidence for the health effects of carotenoids in birds is unlikely to be an artefact of domestication or a phenomenon speciﬁc to antioxidant - demanding neonates that lack sexual colours or to species with carotenoid - pigmented bare parts but , instead , the result of true carotenoid limitations for avian self - maintenance . The challenge now is to deter - mine how pervasive such effects are , and thus how limited carotenoids are for health and pigmentation , in a variety of ornamentally coloured animal species .
