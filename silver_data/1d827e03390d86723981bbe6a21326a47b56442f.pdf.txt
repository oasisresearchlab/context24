Orientation Single Molecule Localization Microscopy ( oSMLM ) for Decoding Orientation of Single Molecule Prakash Joshi and Partha P . Mondal ∗ Mondal Lab , Department of Instrumentation and Applied Physics , Indian Institute of Science , Bangalore 560012 , INDIA ( Dated : June 27 , 2023 ) Standard SMLM facilitates the reconstruction of super - resolution map ( both location and localization precision ) of the target single molecules . In fact , single molecule data does provide information related to the orientation of single molecules , which can be derived from the knowledge of PSF shape and its direction . This information is vital to probe the sub - domain of macromolecules that undergo orientation and conformational changes and provides essential clues on their catalytic activity . Accessing this information in real - time opens up a powerful new window to look into the link between the orientation of macromolecules and the output function . Here , we decode the orientation of single molecules from the knowledge of PSF shape and its direction . The method is primarily based on ﬁeld - dipole interaction and the fact that the distribution of emitted photons strongly depends on the orientation of the dipole ( ﬂuorophore ) with respect to the polarization of light . Accordingly , the photon emission from the specimen and the resultant PSF distribution model is developed . Computational studies show changes in the shape and orientation of the recorded PSF ( in the image / detector plane ) . Speciﬁcally , a set of three distinct distributions ( Gaussian , bivariate - Gaussian and skewed - Gaussian ) are recognized from the study , apart from a superset of all possible ( a total of 16 ) distributions . Experiments were conducted on Dendra2 - Actin and Dendra2 - HA transfected cells that validate the emission model . We report a localization precision of ∼ 20 nm and an orientation precision of ± 5 o . In addition , the distinct orientation of single molecules is noted for Actin and HA in a cell ( Inﬂuenza type - A model ) . Further analysis suggests a preferred directional distribution of Dendra2 - Actin single molecules , while Dendra2 - HA molecules seem to be randomly oriented in a cluster . The availability of orientation information in SMLM without the need for additional optics adds a new feature , which can be explored to reveal the state of a single molecule ( orientation and conformational changes ) in cellular sub - domains / partitions . The study implies that the orientation of single molecules that has more profound implications for the functioning of macromolecules . The orientation information revealed by oSMLM technique gives it a wide - spread appeal and expands the reach of localization microscopy . ORCID ID : 0000 - 0003 - 0241 - 0081 With the advent of super - resolution microscopy , it is now possible to unveil the nanoscopic world of living organisms . The processes that largely facilitate super - resolution are either based on stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) or single molecule blinking . Over the last decade , these techniques have tremendously advanced and present variants are able to resolve features down to sub - 10 nm regime . Needless to say , these technique hold the potential to decipher biological processes both spatially and temporally . Early 1990s saw the emergence of a new concept ( called STED ) that for the ﬁrst time demonstrated the capability to surpass the diﬀraction limit [ 1 ] [ 2 ] . It wasn’t until early 2000s that the ﬁrst far - ﬁeld super - resolution technique is fully established [ 3 ] [ 4 ] . Then the year 2005 - 2006 saw the emergence two diﬀerent techniques ( structured illumination and single molecule localization microscopy ) that surpassed resolution far beyond the classical diﬀraction limit [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] . The ground work for single molecule based super - resolution was largely laid down by Moerner et al [ 9 ] [ 10 ] . These techniques largely convinced that it is possible to surpass the diﬀraction limit set by classical optics [ 11 ] . The success of super - resolution technique saw a huge interest and emergence of a family of techniques over the last decade . Most of these variants were inspired by applications in diverse disciplines across basic sciences [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] . Super - resolution techniques speciﬁcally based on single molecule blinking have advanced our understanding of diverse biological process , both at cellular and organism level . For example , SMLM has revealed the nanoscopic world of macromolecular complexes and its functioning in a cellular environment including , apoptopic pores [ 40 ] , nuclear pore complex [ 41 ] , endocytic machinery [ 42 ] , cytoskeletal structure [ 43 ] . This is made possible by the emergence of technique that are taylor - made for speciﬁc applications . Some of these include , SMLM such as , POSSIBLE , STED , MINFLUX , dSTORM , SIMPLE and ROSE that have shown sub - 10 nm resolution [ 44 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 53 ] . Another class of microscopy techniques that have advanced the reach of super - resolution microscopy are hybrid systems . For example , the integration of light sheet and super - resolution have shown great promise [ 45 ] . It has enabled super - resolution imaging of human mammary MCF10A cell spheroids expressing H2B - PAmCherry [ 45 ] . Multicolor variant such as multicolor STORM imaging of large volumes has enabled ultrathin sectioning of ganglion ∗ Corresponding author : partha @ iisc . ac . in cells to understand the nanoscale co - organization of AMPA receptors and their spatial correlation [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] . Techniques based on RESOLFT microscopy have shown 3D imaging of single molecules organization in a cell [ 38 ] . In another development , evanescent ﬁeld based techniques ( such as SMILE ) has demonstrated volume imaging capabilities in a single cell [ 17 ] [ 18 ] . With the growing inﬂuence of super - resolution techniques , many more developments are expected in coming decade . Although SMLM has enabled ∼ λ / 10 nm resolution , still a lot needs to be determined including , the orientation of single molecules , its actual size , interactions with neighbouring molecules and its temporal dynamics . In this respect , single molecule FRET has shown promise , but very little is know about the orientation of single molecules . However , there has been a handful of studies related to orientation . Recently , a new microscopy technique termed as single molecule orientation localization microscopy have successfully resolved structural heterogeneities in amyloid ﬁbrils and lipid membranes [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . Machine learning is employed to design PSFs for three - dimensional imaging of single molecule distribution [ 24 ] [ 25 ] . Of - late , PSF engineering is a promising technique for revealing 3D position and orientation of single molecules [ 26 ] [ 27 ] . These handful studies does give information related to single molecule orientation , but are complex in instrumentation , cumbersome , and hard to interpret , thereby limiting its use to speciﬁc applications . So , techniques based on standard SMLM and without the need for additional hardware / optics is in high demand . In this work , we propose a new technique to determine the orientation of single molecules in SMLM and classify them based on their PSF distribution . This is primarily based on the fact that interaction of single molecule dipole with polarized light ﬁeld determines the shape of single molecule PSF and its orientation ( in image plane ) , thereby giving discrete information related to the orientation ( θ d , φ d ) of dipole in the object plane . Such an information is revealed by the combination of PSF shape ( Gaussian , bivariate - Gaussian and skewed - Gaissian ) and its orientation in the image plane . In addition , analysis of oriented dipole in speciﬁc domain is also carried out , revealing the corresponding population statistics . Such information are critical in accessing biophysical process including protein - folding and its interaction with the immediate neighbourhood both in ﬁxed and live cell . 2 Schematic Diagram Analysis Graph Reconstructed Image fit function o r i e n t a t i o n a n a l y s i s Raw Data P S F - t y p e e s t i m a t i o n image plane image plane r e c o n s t r u c t i o n object plane Ø Computationally generate superset PSF ( ! !

The technique involves activation of single molecules by a linearly polarized 405 nm light and excitation by a linearly polarized 561 nm light . The interaction of polarized light with single molecule dipole determines the respective diﬀraction pattern ( PSF ) on the image / camera plane . A careful ﬁt of the resultant PSF distribution reveals the PSF - shape classiﬁed as a set ( 3 PSF types i . e , Gaussian / Bivariate Gaussian / Skewed Gaussian ) or a super - set ( 16 PSF types ) . In addition , oSMLM gives the orientation statistics of single molecules . Together these parameters determine the dipole orientation in the object plane .

Optical Setup of oSMLM System The schematic diagram of developed orientation single molecule localization microscopy ( oSMLM ) is shown in Fig . 1 . The illumination sub - system is at the heart of oSMLM , with the activation achieved by linearly - polarized 405 nm light and excitation by a linearly - polarized 561 nm light . A series of standard optics ( not shown ) is used to expand , align and direct both the beam to the inverted microscope . Post interaction ( between polarized light ﬁeld with the single molecule dipoles ) , the ﬂuorescence is collected by the high NA objective ( 1 . 3 NA , 100X , Olympus ) . Then the light is ﬁltered by a series of ﬁlters arranged in a ﬁlter box ( consists of notch and long - pass ﬁlters ) and directed to the sensitive EMCCD detector ( iXon897 Camera , Andor , UK ) by a series of optics ( mirrors , magniﬁer , lenses ) . Note that , a total magniﬁcation of 280X is used for obtaining large PSF . The data is collected at 30 Hz and approximately 5000 frames are taken for each dataset . This is followed by analysis that involves , multi - functional ﬁt ( using , a generalized Gaussian function ) to determine orientation and the shape of PSF . 3 oSMLM Dendra2 - Actin R1 R2 R3 R1 R2 R3 Transfected Cell Image ( A ) ( B ) R2 R1 R3 R2 R3 R1 Dendra2 - HA Transfected Cell Image oSMLM S k e w e d Dendra2 - HA B i v a r i a t e Dendra2 - Actin 0 5000 10000 15000 Skewed Bivariate Gaussian # N % 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Skewed Bivariate Gaussian population statistics population statistics # N ( C ) ( D ) FIG . 3 : Modelled photon distribution of recorded single molecule PSFs .

Characterizing Single Molecule PSF To characterize single molecule PSF and determine its type , the detection sub - system is theoretically modelled and computational studies were carried out . Figure 2A shows the detection sub - system along with the electric ﬁeld in the oil immersion medium , intermediate spaces and at the detection / image plane . Using standard classical electromagnetic theory of light ( see , methods section ) for a multi - layered system ( see , Fig . 6 ) , ﬁeld at the focus of illumination and detection objective are given by eqn . ( 3 ) , and eqn . ( 10 ) , respectively . It is evident that the PSF depends on the polar angle ( θ d ) and azimuthal angle ( φ d ) , and hence uniquely determines the orientation of single molecule dipole . The results are shown in Fig . 2B for various combination of angles , ( θ , φ ) , with 30 o ≤ θ , φ ≤ 90 o . It is visually apparent that , the PSFs distribution varies for diﬀerent combinations of angles . Apart from 16 PSF types , one can further simplify and classify then into three major types namely , Gaussian , bivariate - Gaussian and skewed - Gaussian ( see , intensity plots in Fig . 2C ) . The computational study clearly indicates the role played by ﬁeld - dipole interaction in determining the output PSF distribution and the dependence of the distribution on the angles ( polar angle and azimuthal angle of the dipole ) . Based on Fig . 2 , we have two possible basis set for characterising single molecule PSF : Set of major PSF distribution ( 3 PSFs ) , and a super - set of all possible distributions ( a total of 16 PSF distributions types ) . To establish the theoretical ﬁndings and computational study , the oSMLM system is built and single molecule experiments are carried out . NIH3T3 cells were transfected with photoactivable probes ( Dendra2 - Actin and Dendra2 - HA plasmid DNA ) . Subsequently , the cells were ﬁxed for data collection following standard protocol post 24 hrs of transfection [ 44 ] [ 46 ] . Figure 3A shows a transfected cell image of which a small region is imaged . The intensities used for activation and excitation lasers are , 112 µW and 6 . 12 mW , respectively . The data / images are recorded at 33 Hz and a total of 5000 images are collected . oSMLM reconstructed images and the respective enlarged sections ( R1 , R2 and R3 ) show the orientation of single molecule PSFs along the actin ﬁlaments . In another study , oSMLM is used to understand the clustering behaviour in an inﬂuenza ( type A ) model . Healthy NIH3T3 cells were transfected with Dendra2 - HA plasmid DNA following standard protocol [ 44 ] . The cells were ﬁxed and used for super - resolution imaging to understand the clustering of HA molecules . Figure 3B shows both oSMLM reconstructed images along with the enlarged sections ( R1 , R2 , R3 ) of few HA clusters . The orientation of individual HA molecules in the clusters indicate a heterogeneous mix of dipoles . The corresponding histogram plot ( Fig . 3 ( C , D ) ) shows the distribution of molecules ( PSF types ) as Gaussian , bivariate - Gaussian and skewed - Gaussian , with bivariate appears to be the most abundant . This is a sharp departure from the information available from SMLM and variants that blindly assume 2D Gaussian which may be an over - estimation and must be corrected for accurate 4 D e n d r a 2 - A c t i n G a u ss i a n B i v a r i a t e S k e w e d G a u ss i a n B i v a r i a t e S k e w e d D e n d r a 2 - H A ( A ) ( B ) ( C ) ( D ) F I G . 4 : M o d e l e d P S F - t y p e E n c o d e d M a p o f t h e R e c o r d e d S i n g l e m o l e c u l e P S F i n t h e i m a g e p l a n e u s i n g S e t ( G a u ss i a n , b i v a r i a t e - G a u ss i a n , s k e w e d - G a u ss i a n ) : ( A ) P s e ud o - c o l o r e d i m ag e o f s i n g l e m o l ec u l e s i n D e nd r a2 - A c t i n t r a n s f ec t e d ce ll w h e r e , t h e c o l o r i nd i c a t e t h e P S F - t y p e .

In addition , Fig . 3 ( C , D ) shows the histogram plots of the number of single molecules oriented in a speciﬁc angle . Both Dendra2 - Actin and Dendra2 - HA transfected cells were considered and the population statistics of two class i . e , bivariate and skewed Gaussians are determined . It is evident that , molecules with bivariate - Gaussian distribution are isotropically distributed in the cell , whereas skewed - Gaussian have preferential directions . Speciﬁcally , they are mostly directed in the range , [ 30 o − 60 o ] and [ 22 o − 60 o ] for actin and HA , respectively . Detailed orientation statistics is tabulated in Table 1 . The orientation of a molecule is an important indicator of conformational changes and catalytic activity . The availability of such discrete information at single molecule level is seldom possible with the existing SMLM microscopy techniques , and so oSMLM may play a major role in understanding interactions and other processes ( such as conformational changes and protein folding ) at single molecule level . In addition to standard parameters ( centroid , number of photons and localization precision ) , the data provides multi - class perspective ( in terms of orientation ) of single molecule . Figure 4 displays multi - class data representing the abundance and arrangement of diﬀerent PSF types ( Gaussian , bivariate - Gaussian and skewed - Gaussian ) of single molecules in image place . Here , speciﬁc colors are used to represent PSF type . Few enlarged regions are also shown that clearly indicate the abundance of speciﬁc class of molecules . Statistical analysis of single molecule population indicate the dominant presence of Bivariate as opposed to Gaussian . This is a departure from the general assumption made in existing SMLM techniques forcing all the single molecules to have a Gaussian distribution . In addition , we did observe a small non - negligible fraction of molecules with skewed - Gaussian distribution . In order to understand the impact of polarized light ﬁeld on single molecule , we have also characterized localization precision . The corresponding statistics ( l x and l y ) in the lateral plane is displayed in Fig . 4 . This clearly indicates distinct distribution for Dendra2 - Actin and Dendra2 - HA suggesting a broad spectrum of localizations along X and Y i . e , l x and l y . It is quite evident from the respective plots ( Fig . 4 C and D ) that the localizations are not symmetric , thereby contradicts the assumption of Gaussian photon distribution in the presence of polarized light ﬁeld . In addition , the localization plot suggests localization along x ( l x ) seems to suﬀer more compared to l y in the case of for Dendra2 - Actin . The diﬀerence - plot ( Fig . 4C , D insert ) suggest a large diﬀerence between l x and l y , for Dendra2 - Actin and Dendra2 - HA , respectively . Overall , interaction of single molecules for a speciﬁc state of polarization ( along X ) brings - in non - symmetrical photon distribution , giving information on the orientation and immediate neighbourhood of single molecule . C . Orientation Encoded Reconstructed Map Finally , superresolution image ( in object plane ) is reconstructed along with the orientation information inscribed on it ( see , Fig . 5A , B ) . To do so , we have computationally determined the PSF based on the orientation angles ( both azimuthal and polar angles ) . Theoretical modelling of photon emission along with the beam propagation in the detection system is carried out as discussed in the Material and Methods section ( Theory and Computational Study ) . Speciﬁcally , eqn . ( 8 - 10 ) are computationally implemented and the system PSFs are determined for diﬀerent values of orientation angles ( 30 ≥ θ , φ ≤ 90 ) . The study is carried out on a grid size of 15 × 15 pixels with a XY sampling of 65nm . The combination of θ and φ angles give rise to a set of 16 possible PSF types which can be considered as the basis set for recognizing the orientation angles of the single molecule dipoles ( ﬂuorophores ) . The next step involves the segregation of recorded single molecules into these 16 PSF basis - sets ( super - set ) . This is accomplished by correlating the experimentally recorded single molecule with the basis - set PSFs ( see , Fig . 5C ) . Correlation factor , η > 0 . 92 is considered and the corresponding single molecule PSF is segregated into super - set PSF types and a distinct color is used to represent them . So , the single molecule PSFs / dipoles are color - coded based on their orientation ( combination of azimuthal and polar angles ) in the object space . Analysis reveals the orientation statistics of dipoles for both the cases ( cells transfected with Dendra2 - Actin / Dendra2 - HA ) as shown in Fig . 5D . Speciﬁcally , we noted orientation of dipoles with azimuthal and polar angle ( θ , φ ) at 90 o is dominant for Dendra2 - Actin , whereas , clear dominance of dipoles at , ( θ = φ = 30 o ) is evident for Dendra2 - HA . This gives insight into the orientation preference of single molecules while performing complex biological processes ( such as , clustering ) that has deeper biological signiﬁcance . Conclusion & Discussion A new localization microscopy technique ( oSMLM ) is developed for decode the orientation of single molecules . The technique use polarized light ﬁeld to excite dipole ( single molecule ) and the resultant ﬁeld - dipole interaction gives rise to unique photon distribution pattern ( PSF ) for single molecule ( in the image / camera plane ) , revealing information related to its orientation . Based on the study , we noted that there are three dominant types of single molecules PSFs ( Gaussian , bivariate - Gaussian , skewed - Gaussian ) , although the complete superset comprises of 16 PSF types . These details at the single molecule level gives a plethora of information about the location , orientation , and overall state of the molecule . Two beams ( activation and excitation beams ) , both linearly - polarized are used to illuminate the single molecule dipoles , and the resultant photon distribution of single molecules ( PSF ) is recorded by a 4f - wideﬁeld detection system . Unlike existing SMLM techniques that use 2D Gaussian function as a preferred ﬁt for the detected spots , the proposed oSMLM assumes a generalized - Gaussian function . The advantage of using this function eliminates the need for forcing a pre - assumed function and lies in its ﬂexibility to use non - symmetric PSF distribution . The recorded data is ﬁt and the relevant parameters ( related to uniformity and skewness ) are estimated . This is then used to determined separate localization precisions ( l x and l y ) and orientation ( θ d , φ d ) for further processing . To validate , theoretical model is conceived and computational studies are carried out that resonate with a physical system mimicking ﬁeld - molecule interaction in the specimen ( see , Fig . 2 and II . A ) . Computational study clearly demonstrate the eﬀect of ﬁeld polarization ( along ˆ x ) on the dipole orientation ( φ d , θ d ) . A careful analysis of the PSF ( using intensity plots ) reveal three major distinct class of single molecules , closely resembling normal - Gaussian , bivariate - Gaussian and skewed - Gaussian for 30 ≥ θ , φ ≥ 90 . This directly links the type of dipole orientation in the object plane . Although , a much more complete PSF characterization is revealed by the computational study which is a super - set of 16 possible PSF types ( see , Fig . 2 and Fig . 5 ) . So , in - principle , the decoded orientation information of the single molecule PSF can be incorporated in the reconstructed process of super - resolution map . The simulation results have provided a ﬁrm ground for further investigation and experimental validation . Single molecule signatures are recorded with the oSMLM optical set - up and processed . Two samples are considered , ﬁrst NIH3T3 cells transfected with Dendra2 - Actin for visualizing the organization of single molecules on a Actin ﬁlament , and the second sample is cells transfected with Dendra2 - HA for visualizing HA molecules distribution in a cluster . oSMLM revealed the orientation information of the molecules in an organelle ( Actin ﬁlaments ) and in a HA cluster ( see , Fig . 3 ) . Finally , the recorded single molecule PSFs are segregated into diﬀerent types and statistical analysis were carried out to visualize the dominant type ( see , Fig . 4 ) . Alongside the localization precision in the lateral plane ( both along X and Y ) are carried out to access the PSF shape information . This suggests that a large number of molecules are better localized along y than x - direction , indicating a departure from the notion of isotropic localization which is a prevalent assumption in SMLM and most of its variants . Using these information related to the orientation of a molecule , its position ( centroid ) and localization precision , we were able to reconstruct a super - resolution map with orientation information engraved on it ( see , Fig . 5 ) . Speciﬁcally , a set of 16 possible orientations ( a combination of polar and azimuthal angles ( θ d , φ d ) ) of the single molecule dipole is constructed . An important consequence of this is to determine the preferential orientation of single molecules in diﬀerent biological 7 TABLE I : Orientation Statistics for Dendra2 - Actin and Dendra2 - HA single - molecule proteins in a transfected NIH3T3 cells .

In addition , statistical analysis and population studies are carried out to determine the dominance class of molecules for both the cases , showing preferential orientation states . Such informations are valuable in cell and disease biology to understand the role of single molecule orientation in critical biophysical processes such as , protein - folding , conformational changes . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst time orientation information is revealed from a SMLM data collection , without the need of additional sophisticated optics . Indeed , single molecule data is rich enough to reveal its orientation and the consequences ( related to single molecule neighbourhood , and folding dynamics ) arising out of it . This goes on to show that , oSMLM advances localization microscopy by adding an important feature thereby expanding the reach of single molecule super - resolution microscopy . II .

[ 28 ] , the resultant electric ﬁeld at the geometrical focus of the illumination system is given by , E Nill ( x , y , z ) =   E Nx = − i ( I 0 ill + I 2 ill cos ( 2 φ ) E Ny = − iI 2 ill sin 2 φ E Nz = − 2 I 1 ill cosφ ( 1 ) where ,    I 0 ill = R α 1 o cosθ 1 12 sinθ 1 J 0 ( k 1 ρsinθ 1 ) ( T s + T p cos θ N ) e ik 0 Ψ e ik N z cos θ N dθ 1 I 1 ill = R α 1 o cosθ 1 12 sinθ 1 J 1 ( k 1 ρsinθ 1 ) T p sin θ N e ik 0 Ψ e ik N z cos θ N dθ 1 I 2 ill = R α 1 o cosθ 1 12 sinθ 1 J 2 ( k 1 ρsinθ 1 ) ( T s − T p cos θ N ) e ik 0 Ψ e ik N z cos θ N dθ 1 where , the abberation function is , Ψ I = h N − 1 n N cos θ N − h 1 n 1 cos θ 1 . Here , z = h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h N represent interfaces as shown in Fig . 6 . The components of polarization vector are deﬁned as , (cid:26) ˆ q xk = cos φT p ˆ p k − sin φT S ˆ s k , ˆ q yk = sin φT p ˆ p k + cos φT S ˆ s k , ( 2 ) which is a function of basis polarization vectors ˆ p = ( cos θ 3 cos φ , cos θ 3 sin φ , − sin θ 3 ) and ˆ s = ( − sin φ , cos φ , 0 ) and depends on the Fresnel coeﬃcients T a = T a , 3 − 2 , T a , 2 − 1 for ˆ a = ˆ p , ˆ s . The Fresnel coeﬃcients for the two contributing interfaces are deﬁned by , T a , 1 − 2 = 2 c a , 1 / ( c a , 1 + c a , 2 ) , with c p , l = n l / cosθ l and c s , l = n l cos θ l for l = 3 , 2 , 1 . Note that , spherical coordinates system ( with , 0 ≤ θ ≤ π and 0 ≤ φ ≤ π ) is used for representation . The resultant electric ﬁeld and the illumination PSF are given by , (cid:26) ~ E ill ( x , y , z ) = E Nx ˆ x + E Nx ˆ y + E Nx ˆ z h ill = | E ill ( x , y , z ) | 2 ( 3 ) At the geometrical focus , the ﬁeld interacts with the ﬂuorescent molecules , which act as electric dipoles in the presence of incident electric ﬁeld ~ E ill . This results in the excitation and subsequent emission of light ( ﬂuorescence ) from the radiating dipole ( ﬂuorescent molecule ) . Detection PSF Case I : Oil Immersion Objective Post interaction , the dipole radiates isotropically and a part of which is collected by the detection objective . The emitting dipole is assumed oriented in a direction given by the unit vector , ~ d = ( d x , d y , d z ) = { sin θ d cos φ d , sin θ d sin φ d , cos θ d } , where θ d and φ d are respectively the polar and azimuthal angles ( see , Fig . 6 ) . The electric ﬁeld of the radiation ﬁeld is given by , E dp ( x , y , z ) = A e [ ~ d × ~ d × ~ p ] ( 4 ) where , A e is the constants of proportionality , ~ d is a unit vector along the dipole , and ~ p is the electric dipole moment . Considering the realistic situation that incorporates the eﬀect due to immersion oil , cover slip and specimen . The electric ﬁeld ~ E 1 at the front focal plane of the objective is can be directly written following Torok et al . , [ 29 ] i . e , E 1 = [ R ] − 1 [ P ( N ) ] − 1 [ I ( N − 1 ) ] [ P 1 ] [ R ] [ E dp ] . ( 5 ) where , the metrics , [ R ] is a rotational matrix corresponding to 8 - h 1 - h 2 θ 3 n 1 n 2 n 3 y x z I ll u m i n a t i o n O b j e c t i v e L e n s θ 3 θ 2 θ 1 n 1 n 2 n 3 θ det I m a g e P l a n e T u b e L e n s O b j e c t i v e O b j e c t i v e L e n s C o v e r s li p Cell Medium x y z y x z θ d ɸ d θ 2 θ 1 - h 1 - h 2 φ Φ Φ FIG . 6 : Electromagnetic wave traversing through multiple mediums in a lens focussing system . The diagram shows propagation of electromagnetic ﬁeld through multiple interfaces and its interaction with the single molecule dipole ( red color ) in an oSMLM imaging system . All the parameters necessary to model the ﬁeld ( both in the illumination and detection sub - systems ) in the complex imaging system are shown . Accordingly , the ﬁelds are computed and image of the radiating dipole is formed . coordinate transformation , [ P ] is the rotational matrix for rotated s and p components of electric , and [ I ] corresponds to the change in refractive indices at the interface , with N as the number of mediums involved . Following Ref . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] , the explicit form of the matrices are given by [ 28 ] [ 29 ] , R 3 × 3 =   cos φ sin φ 0 − sin φ cos φ 0 0 0 1   , P ( l ) 3 × 3 =   cos θ l 0 − sin θ l 0 1 0 sin θ l 0 cos θ l   , I ( 1 ) 3 × 3 =   τ p 0 0 0 τ s 0 0 0 τ p   ( 6 ) where , τ p and τ s are the Fresnel coeﬃcients given by , τ s = 2sin θ 2 cos θ 1 sin ( θ 1 + θ 2 ) , τ p = 2sin θ 2 cos θ 1 sin ( θ 1 + θ 2 ) cos ( θ 1 − θ 2 ) [ 28 ] . The objective lens collimates the ﬁeld , ~ E 2 which can be obtained from ~ E 1 , by noting the coordinate transformation from spherical - polar to cylindrical system . Incorporating the eﬀect of lens , the ﬁeld ~ E 2 becomes [ 30 ] , ~ E 2 = p cos ( θ 1 ) [ R ] − 1 [ L ] − 1 [ R ] [ ~ E 1 ] . ( 7 ) where , L 3 × 3 =   cos θ 1 0 sin θ 1 0 1 0 − sin θ 1 0 cos θ 1   describes the changes in the electric ﬁeld as light propagates through the objective lens . Finally , the electric ﬁeld in the image plane can be obtained by taking Fourier transform of ~ E 2 , component - wise . So , the ﬁeld components in the image plane are [ 31 ] ,   E im , x = FT ( E 2 x ) = d x ( L 0 det + L 2 det cos 2 ϕ ) + d y ( L 2 det sin 2 ϕ ) − 2 iL 1 det d z cos ϕ E im , y = FT ( E 2 y ) = d x ( L 2 det sin 2 ϕ + d y ( L odet − L 2 det cos 2 ϕ ) − 2 iL 1 det d z sin ϕ ( 8 ) where ,   L 0 det = R α det o [ 1 / √ cosθ 1 ] sin 2 θ det J 0 ( k det ρsinθ det ) ( T s + T p cos θ 3 ) exp ( − ik 0 Ψ d ) exp ( − ik N z cos θ 1 ) dθ det L 1 det = R α det o [ 1 / √ cosθ 1 ] sin 2 θ det J 1 ( k det ρsinθ det ) T p sin θ 3 exp ( − ik 0 Ψ ) exp ( − ik 3 z cos θ 1 ) dθ det L 2 det = R α det o [ 1 / √ cosθ 1 ] sin 2 θ det J 2 ( k det ρsinθ det ) ( T s − T p cos θ 3 ) exp ( − ik 0 Ψ ) exp ( − ik N z cos θ 1 ) dθ det ( 9 ) and , Ψ D = h 1 n 1 cos θ 1 − h N − 1 n N cos θ N . Here , α det and k det are the angular aperture angle of detector lens and wavenumber in the image plane , respectively . The relation between α 1 and α d is given by , k 1 sin α 1 k det sin α det = k 1 sin θ 1 k det sin θ det = β where , β is the magniﬁcation of the detection system . The corresponding detection PSF ( Photon distribution ) can be obtained from the electric ﬁeld in the image plane i . e , h det = | ~ E im | 2 = | ~ E im , x | 2 + | ~ E im , y | 2 , ( 10 ) 9 Case II : Air Objective Employing air objective for detection is one of the easiest implementation and thus worth considering . In case of air objective , the electric ﬁeld E 1 at the front focal plane of the objective lens ( air objective lens ) is given by the classical relation by Born and Wolf [ 32 ] . Since there is no change of refractive index the dipole ﬁeld ( E dp ) and ﬁeld at the front focal plane ( E 1 ) are the same i . e , E 1 = E dp . The ﬁeld in image plane is given by , ~ E im = ( E im , x , E im , y ) ( 11 ) and the diﬀraction integrals ( I 0 , I 1 and I 2 ) are as derived in Boivin and Wolf formulation [ 32 ] . The corresponding ﬁeld components are [ 31 ] ,   E im , x = [ I 0 ( u ) sinθ d cosφ d + I 2 ( u ) sinθ d cos ( 2 ϕ − φ d ) − 2 iI 1 ( u ) cosθ d cosψ ] E im , y = [ I 0 ( u ) sinθ d cosφ d + I 2 ( u ) sinθ d sin ( 2 ϕ − φ d ) − 2 iI 1 ( u ) cosθ d cosψ ] ( 12 ) where , the amplitude is taken as unity and the diﬀraction integrals are given by ,   I 0 = R α 0 cos 1 / 2 θ sin θ ( 1 + cos θ ) J 0 ( kr sin θ sin φ ) exp ikr cos θ cos φdθ I 1 = R α 0 cos 1 / 2 sin 2 θJ 1 ( kr sin θ sin φ ) exp ikr cos θ cos φdθ I 2 = R α 0 cos 1 / 2 θ sin θ ( 1 − cos θ ) J 2 ( kr sin θ sin φ ) exp ikr cos θ cos φdθ ( 13 ) B . Computational Study Computational studies were carried out using eqn . ( 10 ) to understand the eﬀect of ﬁeld polarization on single molecule dipole [ 33 ] [ 31 ] . Based on the present optical conﬁguration and sample preparation , the refractive indices for immersion oil , coverslip and the specimen are taken as , 1 . 52 , 1 . 52 , and 1 . 33 , respectively . The study was carried out on a grid size of 15 × 15 µm 2 with a sampling of 60nm in the lateral XY - plane . The results are shown in Fig . 2 , and discussed in the Results section . C . Correlation Study For correlation study MATLAB inbuilt function ”corr2” is used . The purpose of this study was to analyse the degree of similarities between the simulated data at the object plane and the image plane . To correlated the image , we have considered simulated data ( superset ) as the basis set . The corr2 function calculates the correlation coeﬃcient , which deﬁnes the linear relationship between the pixel values of the two images ( PSF image and raw image containing single molecules ) . The correlation coeﬃcient of + 1 indicates a complete match of the two images , 0 implies no correlation . In our study we have chosen a cutoﬀ of 0 . 92 as the match parameter , which indicates anything greater than 0 . 92 is considered as matched . The following expression is used for calculating correlation coeﬃcient , r = P m P n ( A mn − ¯ A ) ( B mn − ¯ B ) q ( P m P n ( A mn − ¯ A ) 2 ) ( P m P n ( B mn − ¯ ( B ) ) 2 ) ( 14 ) where ¯ A and ¯ B are the mean of A and B respectively . For computational study , a dipole polar and azimuthal angles of , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 degrees were considered , and the PSF was generated . on a grid of 15 × 15 pixels . The raw data image was reconstructed from the parameter extracted from nlinfit of the raw data using the generalised Gaussian equations . The raw data image was correlated with the basis set and if the correlation coeﬃcient is found greater than 0 . 92 then it is noted and color coded with a color . Each combination of polar and azimuthal angle is represented by a diﬀerent color ( distinguished color ) and they are shown in the Fig . 5 . D . Cell Sample Preparation NIH 3T3 Cells are thawn from - 80 degree and then centrifuged in equal amount of media to remove DMSO content from the cells . The palette of cells are then resuspended again in 1ml of culture media ( DMEM , FBS and antibiotics ) and seeded in the T25 ﬂask with a count of 1lakh to 2lakh cells using hemocytometre , and kept in incubator ( 5 % CO 2 and 37 ◦ C ) for 3 days to get a conﬂuency of 80 - 90 % . The conﬂuent cells are then trypsinated and splitted two to three times ( two to three passage ) before going for the experiment . E . Transfection Protocol NIH 3T3 cells were trypsinated from t25 ﬂask and centrifused to get the palatte . These palette were resuspended in culture media ( 1ml ) . The cells were counted by hemocytometre and 1lakh cells were seeded in bottom coverslip 35mm dish or with the coverslip inserted in 35mm dish . For the later case the coverslip was washed with PBS twice and kept in UV for 1 hr and then it is washed with ethanol and dried in the laminar ﬂow and then the coverslip is inserted in new 35 mm dish . We have put a small amount of culture media on the coverslip ( to make it coated with high nutrient ) and then kept it in incubator to let the media dry so that the coverslip act as a coated coverslip . Then we have put 1 . 5 ml of culture media on 35 mm dish on top of that we have put 1 lakh cells and were shaked properly so that the cells are spreaded all through the coverslip . Then the cells were transfected with D2HA and D2Actin plasmid after 12 - 14 hr of seeding . We have used the manufacturer protocol of Lipofectamin 3000 . The cells were kept in incubator for 15 min after putting lipo - plasmid complex without any other media . After 15 min 500 ul of optimum is added to 35 mm dish and kept for 3 hr in incubator . Post 3 hr DMEM ( 500ul , without FBS ) is added and then kept for another 16 - 18 hr . The cells were then incubated for 36 hr more with the addition of 700ul of culture media . The cells were washed with PBS 3 times and then incubated with paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and then washed again with PBS . After ﬁxing , the cells were sealed in the glass slide using Fluorosave solvent ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) to preserve for a long duration . The glass slide is then observed in the microscopy and the experiments were carried out , both in confocal and super resolution microscopy . F . Data Analysis The image is captured by EMCCD camera which is operated at an exposure time of 33ms . The recorded data is then processed to identify and localize single molecules . The process begins with background subtraction using rolling ball algorithm in MATLAB and then the brightest spots are identiﬁed . Note that , if two bright spots are closer than 1 . 5 times of the diﬀraction limit , both the molecules are discarded . The identiﬁed bright spots are then ﬁtted with a generalised gaussian f p using non - linear square ﬁtting algorithm [ 34 ] , f p ( x , y , µ , Σ , D ) = A φ p Φ p X i = x , j = x , y [ D i , j ( j − µ j ) ] × Φ p X i = y , j = x , y [ D i , j ( j − µ j ) ] ( 15 ) where , φ p ( x , y , µ , Σ ) and Φ p ( x , y , µ , Σ ) denote the probability density function and cummulative distribution function of p - dimensional normal distribution ( with mean µ and covariance matrix 10 Σ ) given by [ 34 ] , φ p = 2 ω √ 2 π B Φ ( x ) = Z x −∞ 1 √ 2 π e − t 2 / 2 dt where , B = A 1 exp ( − ( a ∗ ( X − x 0 ) . 2 + 2 ∗ b ∗ ( X − x 0 ) . ∗ ( Y − y 0 ) + c ∗ ( Y − y 0 ) 2 ) ) , and ,   a = cos 2 θ 2 σ 2 x + sin 2 θ 2 σ 2 y b = − sin2 θ 4 σ 2 x + sin2 θ 4 σ 2 y c = sin 2 θ 2 σ 2 x + cos 2 θ 2 σ 2 y Here D is deﬁned as the shape of the Gaussian with , ( x 0 , y 0 ) as the centroid and ω as the full width half maxima of the Gaussian , D = (cid:18) δ 11 δ 12 δ 21 δ 22 (cid:19) The ﬁtting function facilitates the determination of the centroid of single molecule , its FWHM along x and y , its shape shape , and the angle of orientation . Subsequently , the localization precision is calculated using the following expression , σ i = s(cid:18) s 2 i + a 2 / 12 N + 8 πs 4 i b 2 a 2 N 2 (cid:19) where , i = x , y . Here , N is the number of collected photons , a is the pixel size of the detector , b 2 is the average background signal and s i is the standard deviation of the PSF .
