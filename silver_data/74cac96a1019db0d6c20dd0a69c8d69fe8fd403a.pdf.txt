In early 2021 , Norway faced significant regional variations in COVID - 19 incidence and prevalence , with large differences in population density , necessitating efficient vaccine allocation to reduce infections and severe outcomes . This study explored alternative vaccination strategies to minimize health outcomes ( infections , hospitalizations , ICU admissions , deaths ) by varying regions prioritized , extra doses prioritized , and implementation start time . Using two models ( individual - based and meta - population ) , we simulated COVID - 19 transmission during the primary vaccination period in Norway , covering the first 7 months of 2021 . We investigated alternative strategies to allocate more vaccine doses to regions with a higher force of infection . We also examined the robustness of our results and highlighted potential structural differences between the two models . Our findings suggest that early vaccine prioritization could reduce COVID - 19 related health outcomes by 8 % to 20 % compared to a baseline strategy without geographic prioritization . For minimizing infections , hospitalizations , or ICU admissions , the best strategy was to initially allocate all available vaccine doses to fewer high - risk municipalities , comprising approximately one - fourth of the population .

The actual strategy implemented in Norway was a two - step moderate level aimed at maintaining the balance and ensuring ethical considerations and public trust . However , it did not offer significant advantages over the baseline strategy without geographic prioritization . Earlier implementation of geographic prioritization could have more effectively addressed the main wave of infections , substantially reducing the national burden of the pandemic . 2 Author summary We utilized two geographic - age - structured models ( an individual - based model and a meta - population model ) to conduct a scenario - based analysis aimed at evaluating strategies for geographic prioritization of COVID - 19 vaccines in Norway . By reconstructing the dynamics of COVID - 19 transmission from January to July of 2021 , we compared various alternative vaccination strategies through model simulations , given the limited number of vaccine doses . We found that prioritization of vaccines based on geographic location , alongside considering age , was preferable to a baseline strategy without geographic prioritization . We assessed the selection of which municipalities to prioritize and the degree of prioritization they should receive . Our findings indicated that optimal strategies depended on whether the aim was to minimize infections , hospitalizations , ICU admissions , or deaths . Trade - offs in infection growth between municipalities and subsequent risk - class allocations ( such as age groups ) were the primary factors influencing optimal vaccine allocation . Furthermore , we found that earlier implementation of most geographic prioritization strategies was advantageous in reducing the overall burden of COVID - 19 . 3 Introduction 1 The COVID - 19 pandemic has placed an enormous burden on public health systems 2 globally . Since the first detection of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus in Wuhan , China , in late 3 December 2019 [ 1 ] , it rapidly spread to other countries and triggered a worldwide health 4 crisis [ 2 ] . The first imported case in Norway was confirmed on the 26th of February 5 2020 [ 3 ] . On the 12th of March 2020 , the Norwegian government implemented a 6 national lockdown that involved closure of schools and non - essential businesses , border 7 controls , travel restrictions and social distancing measures [ 4 – 6 ] . The measures were 8 gradually scaled back , and from the autumn of 2020 , the government shifted its policy 9 to regional differentiation based on local transmission levels [ 7 , 8 ] . Until the start of 10 2021 , the government maintained a strict mitigation strategy to avoid overloading the 11 healthcare system , prevent deaths , and focus on early testing and isolation of cases , 12 along with a locally - based contact tracing policy . 13 At the turn of 2020 / 2021 , in the face of the emergence of the Alpha variant and 14 limited global and domestic vaccine production and supply , Norway launched a mass 15 COVID - 19 vaccination program [ 9 ] , mainly distributing the two messenger RNA 16 ( mRNA ) vaccines , Comirnaty ( Pfizer - BioNTech ) and Spikevax ( Moderna ) , to the 17 population . The government initially prioritized vaccines to protect individuals most at 18 risk for severe illness , vaccinating those aged 65 years and above , along with people with 19 underlying medical conditions [ 10 – 12 ] . Additionally , healthcare workers were given 20 priority due to their high exposure and risk of transmitting the virus to vulnerable 21 August 10 , 2023 2 / 76 .

Initially , on the 9th of March 2021 , a moderate geographic prioritization of 26 vaccines was introduced in Oslo and several neighboring municipalities [ 13 ] . 27 Subsequently , on the 19th of May 2021 , a more significant redistribution was 28 implemented , which both increased the amount of the prioritization and broadened the 29 geographic scope of vaccine distribution [ 14 ] . By the 31st of July 2021 , around 3 . 6 30 million ( 68 % of the total population ) and 1 . 8 million ( 34 % of the total population ) had 31 received their first and second doses , respectively [ 15 ] . 32 Selecting a strategy for distributing a vaccine in limited supply during an ongoing 33 pandemic is a complicated task . Particularly , there is a trade - off between direct 34 protection of vulnerable groups versus indirect protection and overall reduction of 35 transmission . Additionally , effective vaccination strategies must account for local 36 COVID - 19 epidemiology . Geographic prioritization of COVID - 19 vaccines can be guided 37 by several factors , including infection rates , hospitalization rates , and mortality rates , 38 while also accounting for the ability to control transmission over time without resorting 39 to lockdown or other measures with significant societal consequences and costs . For this 40 reason , the optimal strategy may vary depending on the objective and aim of the 41 vaccination program . 42 Some modeling studies have explored vaccination strategies , focusing on age , health 43 condition and occupation as the primary targets considered for prioritization [ 16 – 27 ] . 44 Most studies concluded that prioritizing high - risk individuals such as the elderly , those 45 with underlying diseases and healthcare workers is preferred for minimizing deaths . On 46 the other hand , prioritizing younger people who have higher contact rates is better for 47 reducing transmission and hence infections . A few modeling studies have investigated 48 geographic allocation of vaccines taking into account spatial heterogeneities as the 49 secondary consideration on top of age [ 28 – 31 ] . Bertsimas et al . optimized the location 50 of vaccination sites to minimize deaths in the US [ 28 ] . Lemaitre et al . and Molla et al . 51 optimized by age and region simultaneously based on optimal control theory and 52 showed that vaccine allocation to high incidence areas is the optimal strategy to reduce 53 deaths in Italy and Finland , respectively [ 29 , 30 ] . Grauer et al . found that deaths could 54 be significantly reduced if vaccines were distributed focusing on one region at a time , 55 using a computational model with Brownian agents [ 31 ] . 56 In this study , we document the modeling approach used by the Norwegian Institute 57 of Public Health to support policymakers with the COVID - 19 vaccination strategy in 58 Norway [ 32 – 35 ] . The approach includes an individual - based model ( IBM ) and a 59 geographic - age - stratified meta - population model ( MPM ) . Our aim is to perform a 60 retrospective evaluation of the early Norwegian vaccination strategy and examine the 61 effectiveness of alternative geographic prioritization strategies . Our mathematical 62 models are calibrated to historical epidemiological and vaccination uptake data to 63 capture the local COVID - 19 transmission dynamics . To compare geographic 64 prioritization strategies , we vary three key factors : ( i ) the number of vaccine doses 65 redistributed , ( ii ) the number of municipalities prioritized , and ( iii ) the timing of the 66 start of geographic prioritization . These strategies , along with the actual vaccination 67 strategy , are evaluated relative to a national roll - out without geographic prioritization . 68 To assess the effectiveness of these strategies , we explore separately outcomes of 69 infections , hospitalizations , ICU admissions and deaths by calculating the relative risk 70 reduction ( RRR ) of cumulative outcomes during the first seven months of 2021 . Results 71 of the two models are presented side - by - side to examine the robustness of results and 72 highlight any potential structural biases . 73 August 10 , 2023 3 / 76 .

The database contains individually merged data collected 78 from national health and other administrative registers . Data including positive tests , 79 importations and deaths were obtained from the Norwegian Surveillance System for 80 Communicable Diseases ( MSIS ) [ 37 ] . Additionally , data on hospitalizations and ICU 81 admissions were collected from the Norwegian Intensive Care and Pandemic Registry 82 ( NIPaR ) [ 38 , 39 ] . Finally , the vaccination data were obtained from the Norwegian 83 Immunization Registry ( SYSVAK ) , a national electronic immunization registry that 84 records vaccination status of all individuals [ 40 , 41 ] . 85 The data were pre - processed and aggregated by date , municipality , age , and risk 86 status . The risk status , or medical risk group , refers to individuals with one or more 87 defined diseases or conditions ( e . g . organ transplantation , immunodeficiency , diabetes , 88 etc . ) that increase the risk of severe disease and death from COVID - 19 [ 42 ] . Further 89 details about the data used in this study can be found in S1 Appendix . 90 Ethics approval has been obtained for the use of data in this article , authorized 91 through the Norwegian Health Preparedness Act , paragraphs 2 - 4 . More information 92 regarding this approval can be found at https : / / www . fhi . no / en / id / infectious - 93 diseases / coronavirus / emergency - preparedness - register - for - covid - 19 . 94 4 . 2 The two geographic - age - structured models 95 Our study employs two stochastic mathematical models , an individual - based model 96 ( IBM ) and a meta - population model ( MPM ) , to conduct analyses of COVID - 19 vaccine 97 distribution scenarios in Norway . The models were developed to simulate the Norwegian 98 population of approximately 5 . 4 million individuals , taking into account their 99 demographics in terms of age and geographic location . Both models consider the actual 100 age profile and geographic distribution of the population , and simulate the spread of 101 SARS - CoV - 2 from January to July 2021 , when the majority of the first doses of 102 vaccines were delivered to the population . The distribution of population size and 103 density across the Norwegian municipalities is illustrated in Fig S9A and B in S1 104 Appendix . Moreover , we rely on unpublished social contact studies to determine the 105 heterogeneity of contact patterns between individuals of different ages , while the 106 contacts between and within regions are based on mobility data [ 43 ] . 107 To capture the transmission dynamics of the virus , we employ a 108 Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Removed ( SEIR ) transmission model that accounts for 109 symptomatic individuals who may require hospitalization and have a risk of mortality 110 due to severe infection . The models also incorporate interventions such as vaccination 111 and restrictions of social contacts . The distribution of vaccines follows the priority order 112 established by the Norwegian government , while the changes in non - pharmaceutical 113 interventions ( NPIs ) and population contact behavior are captured by the transmission 114 rates , as described in the model calibration section below . 115 4 . 2 . 1 The individual - based model ( IBM ) 116 The individual - based model ( IBM ) , also known as an agent - based model ( ABM ) , 117 captures the complex individual variability and local interactions involved in the 118 transmission dynamics of COVID - 19 in Norway . The 356 municipalities in Norway are 119 subdivided into 13 , 521 cells , and individuals within each cell are assigned ages ranging 120 August 10 , 2023 4 / 76 .

To account for different types of contacts , we construct several 121 contact routes , including community , household , school , university , and workplace . 122 The community contacts are modeled as random processes based on the age of 123 potential contacts and physical distance between cells . Relative contact rates among 124 different age groups are also considered , with the highest contact rate observed among 125 those aged 20 to 29 years according to the unpublished social contact studies . To reflect 126 real - world mobility patterns , we employ a heavy - tailed distribution function based on 127 mobility data from the largest telecommunication company in Norway , Telenor [ 43 , 44 ] . 128 This function results in a greater likelihood of short - distance transmission compared to 129 long - distance transmission . 130 Contacts within households , schools , universities , and workplaces are uniformly 131 distributed among all individuals belonging to those institutions . The IBM’s structure 132 was originally developed to study the transmission dynamics of MRSA in Norway [ 45 ] 133 and has been adapted to model COVID - 19 transmission , as presented in this paper . 134 The code for the IBM is available at 135 https : / / github . com / folkehelseinstituttet / COVID19 vaccination - IBM or 136 https : / / github . com / imlouischan / corona - no . More details on the IBM can be found 137 in S1 Appendix . 138 4 . 2 . 2 The meta - population model ( MPM ) 139 The meta - population model ( MPM ) implements the same epidemiological model as the 140 IBM , but with sub - populations defined by 9 age groups , 2 risk groups , and a varying 141 number of geographic areas based on the prioritization strategy . Contact between age 142 groups is based on Norwegian survey data , while contacts between and within areas are 143 based on the mobility data from Telenor [ 43 , 44 ] . 144 The model is implemented in R [ 46 ] using the odin [ 47 ] and mcstate [ 48 ] packages . 145 The MPM impelementation is available at 146 https : / / github . com / folkehelseinstituttet / COVID19 vaccination - MPM or 147 https : / / github . com / Gulfa / regional vaccination . More details on the MPM can be found 148 in S1 Appendix . 149 4 . 3 SEIR transmission and hospitalization model 150 We employed an SEIR transmission model , which includes pre - symptomatic , 151 symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious compartments , as illustrated in Fig S3 in S1 152 Appendix . In brief , individuals who have not been exposed to the virus or the vaccine 153 are susceptible ( S ) . Upon exposure , susceptible individuals ( S ) enter a latent , 154 non - infectious state ( E a or E s ) , before becoming infectious . Symptomatic individuals 155 first enter a pre - symptomatic state ( I p ) before developing symptoms ( I s ) , whereas those 156 with asymptomatic infections ( I a ) are assumed to recover ( R ) . Individuals with a 157 symptomatic infection ( I s ) may recover ( R ) , or develop severe illness requiring 158 hospitalization ( H ) . Hospitalization can result in discharge and recovery ( R ) , or it can 159 lead to ICU admission ( U ) . ICU admissions ( U ) are followed by a second stay in the 160 hospital ward ( H ) , before discharge and recovery ( R ) . Deaths ( D ) are assumed to occur 161 from the symptomatic state or during hospitalization . The time spent in each 162 compartment follows gamma distributions in the IBM and exponential distributions in 163 the MPM , and the parameters are shown in Table S1 in S1 Appendix . 164 The probabilities of hospitalization and death depend on age and risk status , 165 whereas the probabilities of ICU admissions depend solely on age . We consider that 166 older people have a higher probability of hospitalization compared to younger people , 167 and the risk increases exponentially with age , as reported by another study [ 49 ] . 168 Similarly , people belonging to the risk group for severe illness have a higher probability 169 August 10 , 2023 5 / 76 .

For simplicity , we assume that 170 the probability of ICU admission is independent of risk status . The probabilities of 171 hospitalization , ICU admissions , and death are reported in Tables S3 , S7 , and S8 in S1 172 Appendix . 173 To account for regional differences during the simulation period , we scaled the 174 transmission rate parameter β by a scaling factor for each municipality . These scaling 175 factors , or relative reproduction numbers , were assumed to be constant and calculated 176 based on the proportion of cumulative number of reported cases and population size 177 between February 2020 and May 2021 in each municipality , and are provided in 178 Section S2 . 2 in S1 Appendix . A map showing the distribution of regional scaling factors 179 is also included in Fig S9C in S1 Appendix . 180 We assume a seasonal effect on transmission across all municipalities , with a relative 181 difference of 50 % between the maximum ( in winter ) and minimum ( in summer ) . The 182 seasonality is calculated based on the mean daily temperature for Norway and 183 illustrated in Fig S2E in S1 Appendix . 184 We consider cases imported from abroad and calculate the daily number of 185 importations using monthly data that are aggregated by age and county , as shown in 186 Fig S2F in S1 Appendix . 187 The simulations begin on the 1st of January 2021 concurrent to the vaccine roll - out . 188 To initialize the number of individuals in each compartment , we rely on the results of a 189 separate model used by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health ( NIPH ) for situational 190 awareness and forecasting of the COVID - 19 pandemic in weekly runs , enabling the 191 monitoring of the pandemic in Norway since March 2020 [ 43 , 50 , 51 ] . The situational 192 awareness model provides the total numbers of all age groups and risk factors per 193 county . Within each county , we assume a uniform distribution across municipalities , age 194 groups , and risk factors . This ensures that the total population count is divided among 195 all subpopulations based on their respective population sizes . 196 4 . 4 Vaccination model 197 Based on observational studies during the pandemic , which suggest similar real - world 198 effectiveness , we assume that both vaccines ( Comirnaty and Spikevax ) are equally 199 effective in our models [ 52 ] . 200 We vaccinate individuals who are not infected at the time of vaccination and assume 201 that the vaccines are ”leaky” , meaning that the vaccine effect of both the first and 202 second doses is imperfect [ 16 ] . This implies that vaccinated individuals have a lower risk 203 of infection upon exposure compared to unvaccinated individuals . The vaccine 204 effectiveness ( VE ) of the two doses is assumed to be a two - step monotonically increasing 205 function over time , as shown in Fig S2D in S1 Appendix . For simplicity , the MPM 206 incorporates the leaky scheme by utilizing separate compartments . We assume that 207 people receive their second dose 12 weeks after the first dose . We also assume that the 208 time to reach full effect is 14 days after the second dose vaccination , which is consistent 209 with another study [ 53 ] . Given the relatively short simulation period of seven months , 210 we decided not to consider waning effects of vaccine - derived immunity in this study . 211 We characterize vaccine effectiveness by five types of protection , namely against ( i ) 212 symptomatic infection , ( ii ) asymptomatic infection , ( iii ) hospitalization , ( iv ) death , and 213 ( v ) transmissibility . The first two effects against infection represent a reduction in 214 susceptibility to the virus , while the last effect against transmissibility is translated into 215 a reduction in infectiousness for infected people . Vaccine effectiveness parameters are 216 provided in Table S2 and detailed information with references on the assumptions of 217 vaccine effectiveness can be found in S1 Appendix . 218 August 10 , 2023 6 / 76 .

Elderly 224 people including residents in nursing homes and those with underlying medical 225 conditions were given priority to protect those at greatest risk of severe illness and 226 death from SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 54 ] . In practice , healthcare workers were also given 227 priority . In our models , we positioned healthcare workers after the elderly population , 228 and the distribution of vaccines to municipalities was based on the size of at - risk 229 populations , with priority given in age - descending order ( refer to Table S10 in S1 230 Appendix for more information ) : 231 1 . Elderly aged above 65 years ( divided into three age categories ) 232 2 . Healthcare workers 233 3 . Individuals aged 18 - 64 years with underlying medical conditions ( divided into 234 three age categories ) 235 4 . Adult population aged above 18 years without underlying medical conditions 236 ( divided into four age categories ) 237 The geographic prioritization of COVID - 19 vaccines in Norway was carried out in 238 two steps . The initial step involved making a priority ranking of the 356 municipalities 239 based on the cumulative hospitalization rates per resident population . On the 9th of 240 March 2021 , around the time most individuals above 85 years old had been vaccinated , 241 the government decided to implement moderate geographic prioritization , whereby 20 % 242 additional vaccine doses were allocated to 10 municipalities , including the capital Oslo 243 and four municipalities in the surrounding Viken county that had experienced 244 consistently high infection levels over time [ 13 ] . These 10 municipalities , referred to as 245 the Plus group , received vaccines at the expense of 330 municipalities , referred to as the 246 Minus group , while the remaining 16 municipalities received the same number of vaccine 247 doses and were referred to as the Neutral group . Later in March , the municipality 248 distribution key was changed to population proportions of adults above 18 years old . 249 The second phase began on the 19th of May 2021 , around the time most individuals 250 above 65 years old had been vaccinated , with a stronger geographic targeting of 251 vaccines , where 60 % extra doses were allocated to the prioritized regions [ 14 ] . This 252 strategy involved adding 19 municipalities to the Plus group , primarily major cities and 253 municipalities in Viken , while 319 and 13 municipalities were placed in the Minus and 254 Neutral groups , respectively . The prioritization continued until all eligible adult 255 individuals in the Plus group aged above 18 years had been offered vaccination . 256 To simulate the vaccination strategy used in Norway , we used vaccination data 257 recorded by SYSVAK from January to July 2021 . Real data from SYSVAK revealed 258 that the prioritization plan was not consistently followed considering vaccine deliveries 259 to each municipality and the vaccination of age groups within the municipalities , 260 possibly due to vaccine hesitancy , logistical challenges , and unforeseen events . In our 261 simulations , we proceeded by extracting the daily count per municipality , age , and risk 262 status of individuals who received their first dose of the vaccine and assumed that they 263 would all receive their second dose 12 weeks later . This assumption was supported by 264 the high uptake rate of 90 % among the adult population as of July 2021 ( see Fig S10 265 in S1 Appendix ) , as well as the fact that 93 % of those who received the first dose also 266 received the second dose [ 36 ] . 267 August 10 , 2023 7 / 76 .

The calibration process involved two steps , with the first step 270 focusing on fitting the trend and age distributions of hospitalizations , and the second 271 step focusing on fitting the age distributions of ICU admissions and deaths . 272 In March , the sharp increase in hospitalizations due to the third wave of COVID - 19 273 infections and the arrival of the Alpha variant prompted the government to impose 274 restrictions on social gatherings and travel . To account for changes in NPIs , we 275 implemented two change points for the national transmission rate on the 28th of 276 January and 11th of March 2021 . 277 The calibration involved 12 free parameters including transmission rate parameters 278 and susceptibility to infection parameters . The transmission rate parameters β 279 controlled the time - varying behavior ( contact rate ) in three time periods , while the 280 susceptibility to infection parameters described the relative probability of being infected 281 upon exposure in each of the nine 10 - year age group . Due to computational costs , the 282 models were calibrated to fit the national daily hospitalization data by time and age , 283 and we used a Latin hypercube sampling ( LHS ) to explore the parameter space . The 284 goodness - of - fit was evaluated using a least squares method by the IBM , while the MPM 285 used a Poisson likelihood . 286 The IBM was additionally calibrated to fit the proportions of the four transmission 287 routes based on information provided by general practitioners . The data collected from 288 general practitioners about the likely transmission revealed that 45 . 1 % , 9 . 9 % , 6 . 2 % , and 289 38 . 6 % of cases were infected within households , workplaces , schools , and other settings , 290 respectively . 291 After calibrating the trend of hospitalizations and transmission , we estimated the 292 probabilities of ICU admission given hospitalization and the probabilities of death given 293 infection using age - stratified numbers of infections , hospitalizations , ICU admissions , 294 and deaths over the entire simulation period . The fitted IBM and MPM to 295 epidemiological data are shown in Fig 1 . Both models estimate a significantly higher 296 number ( on the order of a factor two ) of infections than reported cases , particularly in 297 the younger age groups , indicating a high degree of under - ascertainment of cases [ 55 ] . 298 Further details about the calibration of the two models can be found in S1 Appendix . 299 4 . 6 . 1 Sensitivity analysis on the hospitalization probabilities 300 Due to the lack of seroprevalence data in Norway , the precise number of infected 301 individuals remains uncertain . To address the uncertainty surrounding the total number 302 of infected individuals in Norway , we conducted a sensitivity analysis by doubling the 303 probabilities of hospitalization given infection used in our main analysis . As a result of 304 this sensitivity analysis , the model produced a number of infections that closely 305 matched the reported cases . However , it is important to note that there may still be 306 additional unreported cases that were not accounted for [ 55 ] . 307 Nonetheless , in our main analysis , we incorporated the expected under - detection of 308 cases by halving the probabilities of hospitalization given infection based on 309 international literature sources [ 49 , 56 ] . For a more detailed explanation of our 310 assumptions , please refer to S1 Appendix . 311 4 . 7 Alternative strategies of geographic prioritization 312 We developed alternative geographic prioritization strategies for vaccine distribution 313 based on the actual Norwegian vaccination strategy . We ensured the comparability of 314 our models by keeping the calibrated parameters and setting the daily available doses 315 August 10 , 2023 8 / 76 .

As we distributed vaccine doses in pairs ( first and second 316 doses ) , all the numbers of doses refer to the first doses shown in Fig S11A in S1 317 Appendix . 318 We categorized the 356 municipalities into three groups : Plus , Minus , and Neutral , 319 which corresponded to receiving extra doses , fewer doses , and the same number of doses , 320 respectively . We simplified the geographic prioritization process into a single step and 321 assumed that all municipalities followed the national guidelines for age and risk group 322 prioritization . These strategies were defined by three key parameters : 323 • ∆ p : The proportion of extra vaccine doses provided to the Plus group . The 324 proportion received by each municipality is calculated relative to a national 325 baseline strategy without geographic prioritization of eligible adult individuals 326 aged above 18 years . We consider up to a maximum of 300 % additional doses , 327 corresponding to the municipalities in the Plus group receiving quadruple the 328 number of doses relative to the adult population fraction . 329 • ∆ n : The shift of municipality priority towards the Plus group ( ∆ n > 0 ) or Minus 330 group ( ∆ n < 0 ) . The selection of municipalities is based on the relative 331 reproduction numbers of the regions . The shifts in either direction lead to a 332 decreased population in the Neutral group , and the proportion of the population 333 in the three groups changes accordingly . Geographic maps illustrating the 334 distribution of various alternatives is presented in Fig 2 , and more detailed 335 descriptions of the shifts are provided in the following . 336 • ∆ t : The timing of the start of the vaccination program measured in months . The 337 geographic prioritization strategy is assumed to be implemented on the first day 338 of the months , i . e . , on the 1st of January , February , March , April , May , June and 339 July 2021 . 340 To derive alternative strategies , we employed the same grouping of municipalities as 341 the original selection implemented in the second step of the actual strategy , with 24 , 13 , 342 and 319 municipalities in the Plus , Neutral , and Minus groups , respectively . Given the 343 large differences in sizes of municipalities , such as Oslo accounting for 12 % of the 344 Norwegian population , while other municipalities may contain only less than a thousand 345 people , it is essential to consider the proportion of the population that is prioritized . In 346 original selection ( ∆ n = 0 ) , the Plus , Neutral , and Minus municipalities represent 347 approximately 50 % , 20 % and 30 % of the Norwegian population , respectively . 348 The alternative strategies were selected in the following way : 349 1 . We rank each municipality according to their relative reproduction numbers , as 350 described in Section S2 . 2 and Fig S12 in S1 Appendix . Alternative target areas 351 are chosen by shifting the priority of five municipalities at a time , considering the 352 ranking and their priority group . 353 2 . To increase the prioritized geographic region relative to the adopted strategy 354 ( ∆ n > 0 ) , we add municipalities to the Plus group ( originally 24 municipalities ) in 355 successive steps . The top five highest ranked municipalities in the Neutral and 356 Minus groups are moved to the Plus group . This procedure is repeated until 40 357 additional municipalities are shifted to the Plus group , i . e . , 29 , 34 , . . . , and 64 358 municipalities are in the Plus group . 359 3 . To increase the non - prioritized geographic region relative to the adopted strategy 360 ( ∆ n < 0 ) , we add municipalities to the Minus group ( originally 319 municipalities ) 361 in successive steps . The bottom five lowest ranked municipalities in the Plus and 362 Neutral groups are moved to the Minus group . This procedure is repeated until 30 363 August 10 , 2023 10 / 76 .

The geographic distribution of municipality prioritization in alternative strategies . The 356 municipalities are classified into three groups , represented by the colors green ( Minus ) , orange ( Neutral ) , and blue ( Plus ) . Each strategy comprises a different number of municipalities in each group . The baseline strategy ( ∆ n = 0 ) represents the selection made in the real - world implementation . The shifts of municipality priority ∆ n are indicated in brackets , and the number of municipalities in each group is shown accordingly in each panel title . additional municipalities are shifted to the Minus group , i . e . , 324 , 329 , . . . , and 349 364 municipalities are in the Minus group . 365 4 . For each of the 14 selected geographic regions in Step 2 ( ∆ n > 0 ) and Step 3 366 ( ∆ n < 0 ) , as well as the baseline strategy ( ∆ n = 0 ) , we select a value for 367 prioritization of vaccine doses ∆ p ranging from 0 % up to a maximum of 300 % , 368 and a date of implementation ∆ t from January to July 2021 . The maximum value 369 of ∆ p is determined by the population ratio between Minus and Plus , which is 370 presented in Table S9 in S1 Appendix . The number of extra vaccine doses 371 provided to the Plus group for each strategy combination of ∆ n and ∆ p is shown 372 August 10 , 2023 11 / 76 .

As a baseline for comparison of the alternative strategies , we consider a national 374 strategy without geographic prioritization ( i . e . ∆ p = 0 ) . 375 To evaluate the strategies , we conducted 1000 simulations in both IBM and MPM . 376 We used 100 stochastic seeds for each of 10 calibrated parameter sets . Each simulation 377 in the IBM took approximately 3 minutes , while each simulation in the MPM took 378 approximately 20 seconds . All simulations were run in parallel on large computer 379 clusters . We compared each iterated simulation of the alternative strategies to the 380 national baseline strategy without geographic prioritization . To assess the reduction in 381 health outcomes , we calculated the relative risk reduction ( RRR ) using the following 382 formula : 383 RRR = x Baseline − x Alternative x Baseline , ( 1 ) where x represents the cumulative infections , hospitalizations , ICU admissions or deaths 384 over the entire simulation period . The RRR values indicate the amount by which the 385 alternative strategies reduce the health outcomes compared to the baseline strategy . An 386 RRR = 0 means that the alternative is the same as the baseline , while a positive 387 RRR = 50 % means that the alternative strategy reduces the cumulative health outcome 388 by 50 % compared to the baseline strategy . The higher RRR indicates the more effective 389 the strategy to reduce the burden , and an RRR = 1 represents a disease - free situation . 390 In contrast , a negative RRR = − 100 % or − 200 % means doubling or tripling of the 391 outcomes , respectively , compared to the baseline strategy . The following results shows 392 the mean values and their 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CIs ) using ± 1 . 96 σ √ N , where σ 393 is standard deviation of RRR and N = 1000 is the number of simulations . 394 In addition , to evaluate the actual strategy as a special case , we generated another 395 national strategy without geographic prioritization , using the real vaccination data . We 396 adjusted the vaccine distribution starting from the implementation of the first step of 397 geographic prioritization ( i . e . , 9th of March 2021 ) based on the adult population ( aged 398 18 years or older ) in each municipality , while keeping all the data prior to that day . We 399 generated 100 realizations corresponding to the 100 stochastic seeds for each of 10 400 calibrated parameter sets . We chose to compare the actual strategy with this national 401 strategy instead of the fully controlled baseline strategy above for several reasons . 402 Firstly , healthcare workers were given a high priority in the actual strategy , while we 403 vaccinated healthcare workers after the elderly in the baseline strategy . Secondly , the 404 actual strategy in January and February prioritized based on the population of people 405 aged 65 years or older , while we considered all adults throughout the entire period in 406 the baseline . This resulted in prioritized municipalities receiving more doses than in the 407 actual strategy , primarily due to more younger people living in Oslo and its surrounding 408 areas . Thirdly , both the proposed geographic and age prioritization was not strictly 409 followed , especially during the initial phase , in the actual strategy as we could control in 410 our baseline simulations . 411 5 Results 412 5 . 1 Evaluating the actual strategy 413 Table 1 presents the total mean number of infections , hospitalizations , ICU admissions , 414 and deaths from the 1st of January to the 31st of July 2021 under the baseline strategy 415 without geographic prioritization , along with the relative risk reduction ( RRR ) of the 416 actual strategy and best strategies from both models .

The mean RRR ( and their 95 % confidence intervals ) of the actual strategy and the best strategies are shown in the next two columns . The best strategies , selected separately for each health outcome , are shown in the last two columns , and were based on the starting time ( ∆ t ) of the 1st of January 2021 . The brackets in the last column indicate the population fraction of three groups ( Minus , Neutral , and Plus ) . 5 . 2 Alternative municipality priority 421 In Fig 3 , we present the national RRR from two models for various combinations of 422 proportions of extra doses ( ∆ p ) and shifts in municipality priority ( ∆ n ) for alternative 423 strategies , given the starting time ( ∆ t ) of geographic prioritization on the 1st of 424 January 2021 . The leftmost column shows the baseline strategy without geographic 425 prioritization ( ∆ p = 0 % ) does not minimize any health outcome . 426 To minimize infections , a strong geographic prioritization to a small number of 427 municipalities with high transmission levels is optimal . The best strategy involves 428 reducing the priority by moving 25 municipalities to the Minus group ( ∆ n = − 25 ) and 429 giving 300 % extra doses to the Plus group ( ∆ p = 300 % ) , resulting in the highest mean 430 RRR ( and their 95 % CIs ) of 16 . 4 ( 16 . 1 to 16 . 7 ) % and 16 . 0 ( 15 . 7 to 16 . 3 ) % , which is 431 equivalent to saving 40 , 063 ( 39 , 190 to 40 , 936 ) and 31 , 563 ( 30 , 905 to 32 , 221 ) infections 432 in the IBM and MPM , respectively . Similar strategies also minimize hospitalizations 433 and ICU admissions . In the IBM , the optimal strategy involves slightly shifting the 434 priority to ∆ n = − 20 and ∆ p = 250 % , which produces the highest mean RRR ( and 435 their 95 % CIs ) of 19 . 4 ( 19 . 0 to 19 . 7 ) % and 19 . 2 ( 18 . 8 to 19 . 6 ) % , resulting in saving 524 436 ( 514 to 534 ) hospitalizations and 102 ( 99 to 104 ) ICU admissions , respectively . In the 437 MPM , the optimal strategy is ∆ n = − 25 and ∆ p = 300 % , with the mean RRR ( and 438 their 95 % CIs ) ) of 15 . 4 ( 15 . 0 to 15 . 7 ) % and 15 . 6 ( 15 . 1 to 16 . 1 ) % for hospitalizations and 439 ICU admissions , respectively , corresponding to saving 342 ( 334 to 351 ) hospitalizations 440 and 67 ( 65 to 69 ) ICU admissions . 441 To minimize deaths , a moderate level of geographic prioritization to a larger number 442 of municipalities is likely optimal , unlike the strategies that minimize infections , 443 hospitalizations , or ICU admissions . In the IBM , increasing the priority by moving 10 444 municipalities to the Plus group ( ∆ n = + 10 ) and giving 100 % extra doses ( ∆ p = 100 % ) 445 is the optimal strategy , which can avoid 20 ( 95 % CI : 18 to 21 ) deaths with a mean RRR 446 August 10 , 2023 13 / 76 .

In the MPM , the strategy that minimizes deaths is 447 ∆ n = − 15 and ∆ p = 70 % , with a mean RRR of 5 . 5 ( 95 % CI : 4 . 9 to 6 . 2 ) % , 448 corresponding to avoiding 15 ( 95 % CI : 13 to 16 ) deaths . However , choosing the 449 prioritization strategy that minimizes infections at ∆ n = − 25 and ∆ p = 300 % results in 450 a negative effect on deaths with mean RRR of - 4 . 3 ( 95 % CI : - 5 . 0 to - 3 . 6 ) % and - 12 . 7 451 ( 95 % CI : - 13 . 4 to - 12 . 0 ) % , leading to 10 ( 95 % CI : 8 to 11 ) and 29 ( 95 % CI : 28 to 31 ) extra 452 lives lost compared to the baseline strategy in the IBM and MPM , respectively . 453 The gains in the Plus group are similar across all health outcomes , but the losses in 454 the Minus group can be substantial under higher level of prioritization strategies . 455 Fig S15 in S1 Appendix shows the trade - off between municipalities , i . e . the Plus and 456 Minus groups . Similarly , Fig S16 in S1 Appendix shows the trade - off between age 457 groups . When more doses are prioritized , the protection of the younger population 458 increases , resulting in a higher average age of infections . 459 Taking the optimal strategy for minimizing infections in the IBM as an example , 460 Fig 4 shows the trade - off between municipalities by plotting the RRR of each 461 municipality on a map . The municipality - specific RRR of infections , hospitalizations , 462 ICU admissions , and deaths are positive in Oslo and its surroundings because they 463 receive more doses and hence prevent larger local outbreaks . Although the national 464 benefit is larger than the losses in terms of infections , hospitalizations , and ICU 465 admissions , it is not for deaths . Non - prioritized municipalities experience a significant 466 negative impact under higher level of geographic prioritization , creating a large trade - off 467 between age groups . Fig S14 in S1 Appendix shows the trade - off by age groups under 468 different geographic prioritization strategies . 469 5 . 3 Alternative starting time 470 The starting time of changing from the national to geographic prioritization strategy is 471 also a key factor in the strategy for prioritizing vaccines . We selected a subset of the 472 combinations of ∆ p and ∆ n , and explored alternative implementation dates ∆ t ranging 473 from January to July 2021 . Our results indicate that earlier implementation yields 474 better control by reducing adverse health outcomes across most prioritization strategies . 475 Fig 5 shows that the RRR of infections , hospitalizations , and ICU admissions 476 decreases by the starting time across all alternative prioritization strategies . However , 477 the RRR of deaths decreases only when prioritizing in mild and moderate levels 478 ( approximately ∆ p < 200 % ) . For higher priority levels ( approximately ∆ p > 200 % ) , 479 initiating the geographic prioritization in February or March results in a higher RRR of 480 deaths compared to initiating in January , as shown Fig S17 and Fig S18 in S1 Appendix . 481 Nevertheless , the moderate level ( ∆ p = 70 % − 100 % ) with a starting time in January as 482 the previous section shown , the RRR of deaths is the highest among all strategies . 483 Additionally , we found that all the RRR approach zero if the starting time is after May 484 2021 . 485 5 . 4 Sensitivity analysis on the hospitalization probabilities 486 Doubling the probabilities of hospitalization does not significantly change the optimal 487 strategies for minimizing infections , hospitalizations , ICU admissions , and deaths . For 488 minimizing infections , hospitalizations , and ICU admissions , the strategies remain 489 similar to those with the highest prioritization level . The moderate level of 490 prioritization is still preferred for minimizing deaths . Similarly , implementing 491 geographic prioritization after January leads to a decrease in RRR , which reaches nearly 492 zero with no benefits if it starts after May 2021 .

The panels of columns correspond to alternative start time , with the first column reflecting the results shown in Fig 3 .

Apart from the initial growth being more rapid in the IBM , the 497 primary discrepancy between the two models is the number of infections on the 28th of 498 January and 11th of March 2021 , when the transmission rates β undergo a change . 499 Specifically , the infection curve from the MPM decreases instantly and more rapidly 500 than that from the IBM . Moreover , the MPM correspondingly exhibits lower trends of 501 August 10 , 2023 17 / 76 .

However , the MPM shows a 502 higher trend of deaths than the IBM , attributed to the diverse age composition between 503 the two models . More specifically , the IBM shows a greater number of infections among 504 the younger population , whereas the MPM records more deaths in the oldest age group 505 ( aged 80 years or older ) . Furthermore , the complexity of the IBM , which includes 506 heterogeneous contact structures in four transmission routes , contributes to additional 507 variations .

Mathematical models provide a powerful tool for 513 investigating and quantifying the impact of different vaccination strategies . However , 514 during the beginning of 2021 , inherent uncertainties related to lack of data , the complex 515 dynamics of the COVID - 19 pandemic , its uncertain future trajectory , and the lack of 516 knowledge regarding vaccine effectiveness and vaccine supply combined with the need 517 August 10 , 2023 18 / 76 .

Specifically , 518 one difficulty encountered during the pandemic was the accurate estimation of vaccine 519 effectiveness against transmissibility . The vaccines demonstrated significant efficacy in 520 inhibiting the transmission of the wild - type Wuhan variant . However , this effectiveness 521 diminished with the emergence of each new variant , such as the Alpha variant . 522 In this study , we conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate the geographic 523 vaccination strategies for COVID - 19 based on the outcome number of infections , 524 hospitalizations , ICU admissions and deaths in Norway . By comparing alternative 525 vaccination scenarios to the implemented strategy and using historical epidemiological 526 data , we propose optimized vaccination strategies that provide valuable insights for 527 guiding policy decisions and enhancing pandemic preparedness in the future . 528 Our findings demonstrated that early geographic vaccine allocation to areas with 529 high infection levels could reduce COVID - 19 - related health outcomes . However , the 530 optimal geographic deployment of vaccines , considering the geographic scope and the 531 proportion of redistributed vaccines , depends critically on the specific objective , such as 532 minimizing infections , hospitalizations , ICU admissions , or deaths . 533 For minimizing infections , hospitalizations , or ICU admissions , we found that 534 prioritizing 12 - 17 municipalities , comprising approximately 25 % of the Norwegian 535 population , with the highest infection rates at the beginning of the vaccination 536 campaign , and increasing their vaccine doses by a factor of 3 - 4 , is crucial . This 537 approach ensures earlier vaccination of younger people in those regions while delaying 538 vaccination of older people in the non - prioritized regions , thereby offering direct 539 protection to those at higher risk of infection and indirect protection in high 540 transmission areas , consequently reducing the spread in other parts of the country 541 through internal mobility . This finding is consistent with results by Monod et al . [ 58 ] , 542 which identified the age group of 20 - 49 years as the main group sustaining the 543 pandemic , making vaccinating this group in high transmission areas earlier an effective 544 way to control the pandemic . However , it is important to note that targeting a small 545 number of municipalities or a minor proportion of the population can negatively impact 546 mortality and lead to more deaths compared to the baseline strategy without 547 geographic prioritization . This effect is caused by the significantly higher 548 infection - fatality - ratio among older people and the slower vaccine uptake in that age 549 group within low - priority regions . Notably , this pattern was not observed for 550 hospitalizations because most admissions in Norway occurred in the 50 - 70 year age 551 group , while the average age of those dying from COVID - 19 was above 80 years old [ 59 ] . 552 To minimize deaths , an early and geographically extended prioritization 553 encompassing 21 - 34 municipalities comprising approximately 30 % of the Norwegian 554 population ( alongside approximately 10 Neutral municipalities representing 555 approximately 20 % of the Norwegian population ) and a more moderate level of priority , 556 approximately doubling their vaccine doses , yielded the most favorable outcomes . The 557 optimal strategies differed somewhat between the two models , likely due to slightly 558 different population compositions . The results highlight the importance of determining 559 the primary purpose of the vaccination program . In Norway , the government appointed 560 an ethics committee that concluded a vaccination program aimed at minimizing the 561 number of deaths should be chosen [ 60 ] . As we demonstrate , this leads to a significantly 562 different optimal strategy than if the objective were to reduce hospitalizations , for 563 instance . Moreover , we anticipate that minimizing disability - adjusted or 564 quality - adjusted life year lost would also necessitate more geographic prioritization , 565 rather than solely focusing on deaths [ 61 ] . 566 Our findings are consistent with previous studies on geographic prioritization [ 28 – 31 ] , 567 which also recommended prioritizing high incidence areas . This is due to the higher 568 local transmission rate from a geographic point of view , which is controlled by the 569 August 10 , 2023 19 / 76 .

Regions with higher reproduction 570 numbers are the major hubs spreading the disease both internally ( within 571 municipalities ) and externally ( between municipalities ) . Internally , growth rates of 572 infections are exponential - like expanding given R t > 1 even though vaccines are 573 available . Externally , infectious individuals traveling between regions facilitate the 574 spread of the virus , acting as sources of transmission . We assume that people moving 575 between geographic cells follow the distance function , so short - range movement is more 576 likely to happen . For example , Oslo and its neighboring municipalities form a cluster 577 with high infection rates , and suppressing the growth of infections in the cluster before 578 it becomes unstoppable is notably essential . 579 Furthermore , the geographic prioritization across populations is associated with age 580 subsequently because of the individual - level prioritization within populations . The 581 trade - off between infections and deaths is mainly due to the age - specific contact and 582 risk as shown in several studies on age prioritization [ 16 – 27 ] . Many of the studies agree 583 that prioritizing the elderly is the optimal strategy to prevent deaths directly , and so as 584 our assumptions in the models to prioritize in a descending age order , starting with 585 those older than middle - aged with higher risk . The selection of strategies between the 586 direct and indirect effect is eventually to protect the older population . 587 In Norway , the actual strategy implemented was a moderate level of geographic 588 prioritization , which aimed to maintain a good balance between high - risk and low - risk 589 areas . However , our study found that the actual strategy was similar to the strategy 590 without geographic prioritization , mainly because the second phase of the geographic 591 prioritization as a core part was implemented in May 2021 , which was too late to 592 control the pandemic . In fact , this is consistent with our results on starting time . 593 Our study also highlights the importance of starting geographic prioritization as 594 early as possible in reducing infections , hospitalizations , and ICU admissions . The time 595 switching from the baseline strategy to geographic redistribution could play a significant 596 role during the first three to four months of the implementation . Implementing 597 geographic prioritization after May 2021 was less effective for two primary reasons . 598 First , the main wave of infections had already occurred in March , and the transmission 599 had decreased to R t < 1 as a result of extensive societal lockdown measures . The 600 number of infections in May only reached one - fourth of the peak , making the 601 vaccination strategy at that point less critical . This emphasizes the necessity of 602 geographic prioritization during the first few months to reduce infections and 603 subsequently severe illness . Second , most of the elderly , especially those above 80 years 604 old , had already been vaccinated before May . 605 Postponing the implementation of geographic prioritization of vaccines reduce the 606 RRR of outcomes on infections , hospitalizations , and ICU admissions . However , when 607 considering a high level of geographic prioritization ( such as more than tripling the 608 number of doses to prioritized municipalities ) , postponing the implementation by one or 609 two months could accelerate vaccination of the oldest age group and directly prevent 610 deaths . Conversely , for mild or moderate levels of geographic prioritization , earlier 611 implementation would be consistently a more effective strategy . This trade - off between 612 priority level and start time is dependent on the decision to minimize either infections , 613 hospitalizations , and ICU admissions , or deaths . Therefore , while earlier 614 implementation of geographic prioritization could prevent more cases , it might not 615 necessarily result in a substantial reduction in deaths . Conversely , postponing the 616 implementation tended to converge towards the national distribution strategy . To make 617 a good balance , there were two potential solutions : ( i ) implementing an earlier 618 geographic strategy with a moderate level , or ( ii ) postponing a high priority level of 619 geographic strategy would allow vaccine doses to be used more efficiently in reducing all 620 infections , hospitalizations , ICU admissions , and deaths across the population .

The 625 same practice was done in the real - time analysis during the COVID - 19 pandemic to 626 determine recommendations of the vaccination strategies in Norway . The national 627 recommendation reports by NIPH are available online [ 32 – 35 , 65 – 76 ] . As an example , 628 the geographic prioritization strategies were evaluated by our two models in the middle 629 of distributing vaccines in February and March 2021 [ 32 – 35 ] . The use of our two models 630 not only assisted in error detection during development but also provided a backup plan 631 for implementation issues , particularly when working under tight deadlines . This 632 retrospective study serves as a valuable tool for preparedness planning , providing 633 valuable insights on how to allocate resources ( i . e . , vaccines ) and how to prepare for 634 future pandemics . In situations with new respiratory viruses where we can assume a 635 high degree of geographic variation in transmission , it is important to consider 636 geographic prioritization of a limited vaccine supply from the first dose given . This 637 study provides an example of the importance of such prioritization and the value of 638 large - scale computational modeling in public health decision - making . 639 In this study , it is crucial to consider several key assumptions and limitations when 640 interpreting the results . First , we incorporated various simplifications concerning the 641 properties of the virus and its transmission rates throughout the simulation period . We 642 did not account for the growth of the Delta variant from July 2021 , resulting in an 643 underestimation of infections during the final phase . However , it is important to 644 acknowledge that the impact of vaccination and its prioritization was beneficial during 645 the Delta variant wave and in the longer term . The effectiveness of the prioritization 646 strategy could have been even greater if potential cases that might have gone 647 undetected were taken into consideration . Furthermore , we acknowledge that Norway , 648 along with several other European countries , implemented a strict societal lockdown , 649 resulting in a significantly lowered transmission rate during the spring . This shutdown 650 of society created an exceptionally unnatural situation . In a scenario without such 651 strong interventions , the effects of vaccine prioritization would likely have been different . 652 Additionally , as our focus was on the short simulation period of 7 months , we did not 653 account for waning vaccine immunity , despite the fact that immunity against infection 654 may decline before the completion of 7 months . Future studies should explore the 655 impact of waning immunity and booster doses given in a longer time frame . 656 Second , we assumed that all healthcare workers were vaccinated after the elderly 657 ( aged 65 or above ) in our alternative strategies . This resulted in the elderly aged 65 658 years or older being vaccinated earlier than in the actual vaccination strategy , leading to 659 an underestimation of the number of deaths in alternative scenarios . This differs from 660 the actual vaccination strategy , which prioritizes front - line essential workers who have a 661 higher risk of preventing outbreaks in hospitals and supporting the healthcare system . 662 However , we assumed that these healthcare workers had the same contact rates as the 663 general population in our models . 664 Third , while comparing different strategies , we kept the same transmission rates β as 665 calibrated using the actual vaccination strategy . We assumed that the transmission 666 rates vary with a seasonal effect , which is higher in winter and lower in summer [ 77 ] . 667 The only difference was the plan of the vaccination program . We assumed that 668 measures such as NPIs would remain exactly the same in all alternatives , although some 669 regions could have large outbreaks . National interventions were captured by the 670 transmission rates at three time intervals , while no regional interventions were 671 considered in this study . We also assumed that the relative reproduction numbers of 672 each municipality were stationary ( i . e . , constant in time ) . This made vaccination the 673 August 10 , 2023 21 / 76 .

Further 676 research is needed to better describe the geographic variation in transmission rates 677 among the municipalities . 678 Fifth , a key limitation of this study is that the contact matrix used was obtained 679 during the pre - pandemic period . It is likely that the pandemic has changed contact 680 patterns , with older populations likely reducing their contacts more in the first half of 681 2021 [ 78 ] . Regarding our estimates on the susceptibilities to infection , which decrease by 682 age ( except aged 50 - 59 years ) , this differs from the findings in other modeling 683 studies [ 79 – 81 ] and cohort studies [ 82 , 83 ] . Nonetheless , our estimates effectively capture 684 the dynamics of transmission and address the distinction in their contact behavior . The 685 decreasing susceptibilities could be associated with their contact patterns , the 686 age - specific risk ratio of the Alpha variant estimated in Norway [ 56 ] , or the assumed 687 age - independent vaccine effectiveness . However , all models fitted well to the data and 688 projected more infections than tested cases to reveal under - detection , especially of 689 asymptomatic people or those with mild symptoms . 690 Finally , we assumed unrealistically that the capacity and logistics of vaccine 691 distribution could always accommodate our scenarios . While the overall logistics in 692 Norway were generally well developed , establishing vaccine centers for preparedness may 693 require additional resources . Two main resources were needed when giving vaccines to 694 the population : the number of doses in stock and human resources needed to vaccinate 695 individuals in the front - line . We fixed the number of ( first ) doses per day nationally in 696 all scenarios in accordance with the former , but there might be limits in the number of 697 doses for each region , which might realistically cause problems due to the latter . 698 Additionally , there might not be enough staff capacity or time to transport and handle 699 large amounts of doses , although we prioritized some high - risk regions by giving 300 % 700 extra doses . Similar limitations exist regarding the assumption of the timing of 701 receiving the second dose to be 12 weeks for everyone . Future studies should address the 702 issue of distributing vaccines with different time delays between two doses as reported 703 by the NIPH [ 35 ] and some studies [ 84 – 86 ] . 704 To conduct a more comprehensive evaluation of geographic vaccination strategies , it 705 is crucial to consider additional factors [ 61 ] . These factors include the impact of 706 lockdown measures , the assessment of both short - term and long - term health outcomes , 707 disease burden estimates that encompass the extended effects of ICU stays and 708 post - infection complications or long COVID , as well as the implications of healthcare 709 prioritization in regions characterized by high infection rates . 710 During a pandemic , social acceptability plays a crucial role in vaccine distribution . 711 Prioritizing high - incidence areas with a larger allocation of doses can result in smaller 712 municipalities facing inadequate supplies , necessitating a temporary halt to their 713 vaccination programs . The evolving public sentiment surrounding the vaccination policy 714 underscores the potential consequences on public trust and support . Therefore , it is 715 essential to strike a balance between ensuring equitable distribution and maintaining 716 public confidence in vaccination efforts , highlighting the ethical considerations that arise 717 in this context [ 62 ] . 718 In conclusion , our study provides important insights into the effectiveness of 719 different COVID - 19 vaccine distribution strategies in reducing mortality and morbidity 720 in Norway . Our results suggest that geographic prioritization of vaccines can improve 721 health outcomes during the initial phase of the vaccination program . However , the 722 optimal level of geographic prioritization depends on the specific health outcomes 723 targeted , and a moderate level of prioritization may be optimal for minimizing deaths . 724 It is important to note that our analysis is based on modeling and retrospective data 725 August 10 , 2023 22 / 76 .

Employing these methodologies is particularly significant , as they enable the 726 integration of supplementary information that was not available during the initial phase . 727 While the policy of geographic prioritization in Norway has helped reduce the number 728 of deaths , it may not have been optimized to minimize infections or avoid local 729 outbreaks . Nonetheless , our findings can provide valuable guidance for policymakers in 730 other countries or for future outbreaks , helping them make informed decisions about 731 vaccine distribution strategies . 732 7 Supporting information 733 S1 Appendix .

S1 . 1 Individual - based model ( IBM ) In this study , we adapt a stochastic IBM previously used for studying Methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) transmission [ 45 ] to model the spread of COVID - 19 . Our model incorporates individual - level factors such as age , location , occupation , risk status , epidemiological status , hospitalization status , and vaccination status . We characterize our synthetic population using Norwegian census data , and assign individuals to households based on population density and age distribution in 13 , 521 contiguous areas known as Grunnkrets in Norwegian or Basic circuits in English [ 87 ] . Occupation locations , including schools , universities , workplaces , and those who are unemployed or retired , are assigned based on age . The simulated age - specific contact matrices in different routes are depicted in Fig S1 . Our model aligns with other similar models used to study different interventions against COVID - 19 [ 18 , 20 , 27 , 88 – 90 ] . S1 . 1 . 1 Households To generate a distribution of household sizes for individuals , we utilize a two - dimensional size - age distribution , as illustrated in Fig S2A , from Statistics Norway [ 92 ] . Specifically , individuals are assigned to households ranging in size from 1 ( i . e . , single living ) to a maximum of 7 individuals , with households determined based on the size - age distribution . Individuals aged 15 years and younger are assigned to households with at least two individuals . Individuals aged 88 years and older are aggregated into a single category , as data availability indicates that they are primarily living alone . The methodology underlying household construction follows the algorithm used in [ 45 , 91 ] . S1 . 1 . 2 Occupations Individuals are assigned in schools , universities or workplaces according to their ages and specific places according to size distributions of occupations . Specifically , children between 1 and 5 years old attend kindergarten , those between 6 and 15 years old attend primary school , those between 16 and 18 years old attend secondary school , and those over 19 years old attend university . Individuals who are 17 years old or older and not attending university or unemployed are assigned to workplaces [ 45 ] . In the context of the COVID - 19 pandemic , it is assumed that 20 % of employees work from home as a result of Norwegian interventions implemented in 2021 . In addition , some individuals are specifically assigned to work as healthcare workers based on an age distribution , and they are given priority for vaccination within the population . S1 . 1 . 3 Community In the individual - based model , contact between individuals can occur through community activities as long as they are not completely isolated from society . Community contacts refer to interactions that take place outside of the home , school , or workplace , and may include activities such as taking public transportation , grocery shopping , dining out , socializing with friends , and visiting non - cohabiting family members . Age - specific contact data were collected in Norway in 2017 and show that younger individuals have higher rates of community contact than older individuals . August 10 , 2023 34 / 76 .

The age - specific contact pattern in the IBM . The age - specific contact frequencies of each transmission setting and total sum across all settings from low to high are represented by a color gradient from blue to red . The total frequency is obtained by the linear combination of each transmission setting , with the corresponding contributing proportion shown in brackets . These contact patterns are similar to those in the modeling study in the UK [ 91 ] . Additionally , we account for individual mobility , where contact patterns can vary by distance . We obtained mobility data for each municipality in Norway from Telenor in 2021 [ 44 ] . These data reveal that long - range movements , such as travel from Oslo to Bergen , occur less frequently than short - range movements , such as travel between different districts in Oslo . Fig S2B shows the fitted distribution of mobility distances based on the proportion of radius of gyration for the top five most populated municipalities in Norway ( Oslo , Bergen , Trondheim , Stavanger , Bærum ) . S1 . 1 . 4 Epidemiological status Each individual in the model is assigned an epidemiological status according to a SEIR - like epidemiological model , which is illustrated in gray in Fig S3 . A susceptible individual can become infected by coming into contact with asymptomatic , pre - symptomatic , or symptomatic infectious individuals . Once infected , the individual becomes exposed , but is not yet infectious , and may develop either asymptomatic or symptomatic illness in the next few days . The probability of remaining asymptomatic is 40 % , while the probability of developing pre - symptomatic illness before becoming symptomatic is 60 % . Symptomatic individuals may either recover or die , as shown in red and blue in Fig S3 , respectively . Asymptomatic individuals who become infected are assumed to recover without developing symptoms . The time spent of each status following exposure is represented by a gamma distribution and is age - independent . Table S1 shows the parameters for each status .

The model assumptions . A : Age - specific distribution of household sizes in Norway . The gray color represents that those 15 years old and younger are not single living . The rightmost column shows the group of individuals 88 years old or older , who are primarily living alone . Household counts are shown on a log - scale . B : The municipality - specific mobility pattern in Norway . The proportions of radius of gyration of the top 5 most populated municipalities ( Oslo , Bergen , Trondheim , Stavanger , Bærum ) are shown in a log - scale . C : The generation time distribution . Probability mass function ( PMF ) of the generation time distribution of the individual - based model is illustrated using results from one simulation . The median generation time is 7 days . D : The growth of vaccine effectiveness . The effectiveness of the first dose increases linearly from zero to the first full effect in 28 days ( 4 weeks ) and then remains constant for 56 days ( 8 weeks ) after reaching the first full effect . The time interval between first and second doses is assumed to be 84 days ( 12 weeks ) . The effectiveness of the second dose increases linearly to the second full effect in 14 days ( 2 weeks ) after vaccination . E : The seasonality of transmission rate . The relative seasonality of transmissibility starts from 1 . 0 on the 1st of January and varies according yearly temperature data in Norway . The 50 % seasonality refers to a 50 % decrease in the lowest transmissibility during summer compared to the highest in winter . F : The importation of cases . The daily imported cases are average values based on monthly national data from MSIS . The observed monthly cases from January to July 2021 were 1505 , 313 , 809 , 579 , 285 , 221 , 973 . These cases were then distributed among different counties and age groups according to empirical distributions . a primary case and a secondary case , is approximately 7 days . An example of the generation time distribution from one simulation is shown in Fig S2C . The probability of death given a symptomatic infection is age - specific and depends on whether an individual belongs to a risk group , i . e . risk status . These values are calibrated using Norwegian registry data , which is explained in the following section . August 10 , 2023 36 / 76 .

The epidemiological and hospitalization model . Susceptible individuals ( S ) who have not been exposed to the virus or the vaccine , upon exposure , enter a latent state ( E a or E s ) before becoming infectious . Symptomatic individuals enter a pre - symptomatic state ( I p ) before developing symptoms ( I s ) . Asymptomatic infections ( I a ) are assumed to recover ( R ) without developing symptoms . Those with symptomatic infections ( I s ) may recover ( R ) or require hospitalization ( H ) due to severe illness . Hospitalization can lead to recovery ( R ) , or admission to the ICU ( U ) followed by a second stay in the hospital ward ( H ) , and eventual recovery ( R ) . Deaths ( D ) occur from the symptomatic state or during hospitalization . The epidemiological statuses are shown in gray . S : susceptible . E a : asymptomatic exposed . I a : asymptomatic infectious . E s : symptomatic exposed . I p : pre - symptomatic infectious . I s : symptomatic infectious . R : recovered . The solid directed lines are transitions between statuses and the dashed directed lines represent infectious transmissions . The symptomatic infectious people may be hospitalized shown in red statuses and / or die shown in blue as extra layers . H : hospitalized . U : ICU admission . D : died . Table S1 .

While some hospitalized individuals may not require ICU admission and can recover and be discharged after a few days , others may need to stay in the hospital longer , especially those who require ICU admission . Age is the only factor that influences the time spent in hospital or ICU . The time spent in each status , including the time from symptom onset to hospitalization , follows negative binomial distributions with their probabilities and size parameters . We first model the time from symptom onset to hospitalization and then split it into two ways to model individuals requiring ICU admission and those who do not . For those who do not require ICU admission , the length of stay in the hospital is captured by one distribution . For those who require ICU admission , we model the time from hospitalization to ICU admission , length of stay in ICU , and length of stay in the hospital after ICU admission in three separate steps . The probabilities of hospitalization given symptomatic infection are age - specific and depend on whether individuals belong to a risk group . These probabilities are calibrated using Norwegian registry data , which we present in the next section . S1 . 1 . 6 Vaccination status Each individual can be vaccinated on a specific date . However , after vaccination , it takes some time for immunity to develop , and protection increases gradually over the following weeks . In this study , we assume a leaky type of vaccine effectiveness instead of an all - or - nothing effect [ 16 ] . This means that while all vaccinated people are not fully protected , their risk of infection is reduced by a certain fraction in each contact . Additionally , we assume no waning immunity during the simulation period due to its relatively short duration . Our assumptions for vaccine effectiveness are as follows . The protection probability increases linearly from zero to the first full effect during the first 28 days ( 4 weeks ) after vaccination . The effectiveness then remains constant for the following 56 days ( 8 weeks ) , as the time interval between the first and second doses is assumed to be 84 days ( 12 weeks ) . We assume that everyone who takes the first dose will take the second , and that the effectiveness of the second dose increases linearly to the second full effect over the following 14 days ( 2 weeks ) . The vaccine provides several protections against ( i ) symptomatic infection , ( ii ) asymptomatic infection , ( iii ) hospitalization , ( iv ) death and ( v ) transmissibility . The full protection are ( i ) 71 / 91 % , ( ii ) 55 / 77 % , ( iii ) 78 / 94 % , ( iv ) 84 / 94 % and ( v ) 65 / 65 % after the first / second dose , respectively . The values are based on the recommendation reports by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health ( NIPH ) [ 32 – 35 ] and are similar to estimates from another study [ 53 ] . Table S2 and Fig S2D show the vaccine effectiveness and its growth over time . The conditional effectiveness against severe illness ( i . e . hospitalization or death ) given symptomatic infection can be calculated by Eq ( S1 ) . VE H | I = 1 − 1 − VE H 1 − VE I , ( S1 ) where VE H | I , VE H , VE I are the vaccine effectiveness against severe illness given symptomatic infection , severe illness and symptomatic infection , respectively . For example assuming vaccine reaches the maximum effectiveness ( i . e . more than 2 weeks after the second dose ) , we have VE I = 0 . 91 , VE H = 0 . 94 and VE H | I = 0 . 33 , which means that the risk of severe illness given symptomatic infection is reduced by 33 % . S1 . 1 . 7 Seasonality Apart from control interventions , the transmission rate is known to vary seasonally , with higher rates occurring in the winter and lower rates in the summer . We assume a 50 % relative difference between the highest and lowest seasonal rates , August 10 , 2023 38 / 76 .

The effectiveness of the second dose increases linearly to the second full effect in 14 days ( 2 weeks ) after vaccination . which is defined based on the temperature over a year . Fig S2E illustrates the seasonal variation in the transmission rate from January to July . S1 . 1 . 8 Importation Importation of infectious cases is simulated by converting susceptible individuals to either symptomatic or asymptomatic infected individuals . We select individuals based on age - and location - specific empirical distributions derived from observed data . At each time step ( each day ) in the simulation , a daily importation number is drawn from a Poisson distribution with a time - varying mean , which is based on the data presented in Fig S2F . S1 . 1 . 9 Calibration We calibrated the ratios between the four setting - specific betas ( household , school , workplace , and community ) using COVID - 19 test positive data . The main contributions to the positive cases were infections within households and in the community , which includes all routes other than households , schools , or workplaces . To account for time - specific changes , we divided the seven - month simulation period into three intervals , separated by two change points on the 28th of January and 11th of March 2021 . We selected the change points based on the local minimum and maximum rolling averages of daily hospital admissions and shifted them back 12 days to account for the average delay between infection and hospitalization . To calibrate the IBM , we used 12 free parameters , including beta ( i . e . transmission rates ) during three time periods and susceptibilities of nine age groups to capture time - specific changes and age - specific differences , respectively . We sampled 100 , 000 parameters using the Latin hypercube sampling ( LHS ) approach and selected the best 10 sets based on the least squares method . The least squares error was calculated using a data set consisting of two marginal distributions : N t = 212 time points of daily hospital admissions and the seven - month cumulative admissions of N a = 9 age groups . The least squares error is L 2 = N t (cid:88) t = 1 (cid:32) N a (cid:88) a = 1 x t , a − N a (cid:88) a = 1 y t , a (cid:33) 2 + N a (cid:88) a = 1 (cid:32) N t (cid:88) t = 1 x t , a − N t (cid:88) t = 1 y t , a (cid:33) 2 , ( S2 ) where x t , a and y t , a are the daily hospital admission of model output and observed data at time t and of age group a , respectively . The marginals (cid:80) N a a = 1 y t , a and (cid:80) N t t = 1 y t , a are the daily hospital admissions of all ages at time t and the 7 - month total hospital admissions of each age group a , respectively .

Fig S4 shows the final round parameter distributions , with higher beta values in February corresponding to the growth of cases in March . Our estimated susceptibilities to infection showed a decrease with age , except for the 50 - 59 age group . This is in contrast to findings in other modeling studies [ 79 – 81 ] and cohort studies [ 82 , 83 ] . Several factors could explain these differences . First , we applied age - specific risk ratios of the Alpha variant in Norway [ 56 ] , which had large uncertainties and may have overestimated values for younger age groups or underestimated values for older age groups . Therefore , susceptibilities for older individuals may have been underestimated . Second , our age - specific contact patterns were taken from 2017 before the pandemic , while contact matrices in other modeling studies [ 80 , 81 ] were separated into pre - pandemic and post - lockdown periods . It is possible that older individuals reduced their contacts more than younger individuals during the pandemic , leading to underestimated susceptibilities for older age groups . Third , vaccine effectiveness may have been lower for older individuals [ 93 ] , while we assumed equal effectiveness across all age groups , which may have overvalued vaccine effectiveness for older individuals and led to underestimated susceptibilities for this group . The national recommendation reports by NIPH addressed this issue by splitting vaccine effectiveness into two categories : those aged 65 years and younger and those older than 65 years [ 94 – 97 ] . Fig S5 shows the fits of the model to the data . The estimated numbers of infections are higher than the reported cases due to under - detection , particularly in younger age groups . The calibration process uses only daily and age - specific hospital admissions to estimate the 12 free parameters . The good match between the observed and modeled ICU admissions and deaths in Fig S5A validates the calibration method . Fig S5C , which shows the geographic - specific differences not used in the estimation , also supports the model accuracy . Using the observed number of deaths and the estimated mean number of infections , we calculate the age - specific probabilities of death given infection . The age - specific probabilities of ICU admission given hospitalization are calculated based on the observed numbers of ICU admissions and hospitalizations . The resulting age - specific probabilities of death and ICU admission are presented in Table S3 .

S1 . 2 Meta - population model ( MPM ) The meta - population model ( MPM ) is based on an epidemiological model identical to the one used in the individual - based model ( IBM ) . The model incorporates meta - populations that are characterized by age , risk factor , and geography . The geographic regions are based on the five regions of Norway ( North , West , Mid , East , and South ) and different prioritization schemes . This results in a representation of every possible combination of prioritization ( Plus , Neutral , or Minus ) and region . In the baseline model , we have 10 geographic regions , 9 age groups , and 2 risk profiles , resulting in 180 separate meta - populations . Vaccination is incorporated as an additional layer of meta - populations , resulting in 540 meta - populations in the baseline when considering 3 vaccination states ( No vaccine , first dose , and second dose ) . The vaccinated groups exhibit different values for susceptibility , severity , and transmissibility compared to the August 10 , 2023 41 / 76 .

We define the contact matrix such that amount of infectiousness that ”leaks” out of a region is equal to the fraction of the population who traveled out of the region in one day . If the number of of travelers from region i to region j is T ij and the population in region i is P i , then the regional contact matrix is given by : M ij = ( P i − (cid:80) j T ij ) δ ij + T ij ( 1 − δ ij ) P i , ( S38 ) where δ ij is the Kronecker delta symbol such that δ ij = 1 for i = j and zero otherwise . S1 . 2 . 3 Vaccination As in the IBM , the vaccine effects for the different doses are given in Table S2 . In the MPM , we implement the time from receiving the first dose to getting the full effect of this dose as half the ramp - up time used in the IBM which corresponds to 14 days . Then the effect of the second dose is taken into account after the time interval between the doses of 84 days . The vaccination is implemented separately from the equations above as a constant moving of people from one meta - population i to another j at the appropriate time as determined by the vaccination strategy . We also assume that the doses are equally distributed among everyone who has not yet been vaccinated including the people in other compartments than S , who will not receive any benefits . S1 . 2 . 4 Seasonality and importation Seasonality is implemented in the same way in the MPM model as in the IBM . Importation is implemented as shown in the model specification above by flipping on member of the S compartment to the I compartment . The amount of importation is identical to the IBM . S1 . 2 . 5 Calibration The calibration of the meta - population model follows the same overall approach as the IBM . We aim to simultaneously calibrate β - values and susceptibility values to the hospital incidence over time and to the age distribution of cumulative hospitalizations , shown in Fig S7 . The two targets are calibrated at the same time by assuming that the observed cumulative age distribution is constant over time and we define a log - likelihood for a given day t : LL t = (cid:88) i pois ( X it , prop i O t ) , ( S39 ) where pois is the Poisson distribution , X i t the modeled hospital incidence in age - group i on day t , prop i is the proportion of the cumulative hospitalization that is in age group i and O t is the observed hospital incidence on day t . From this log - likelihood we use a particle filter to better estimate the likelihood for the stochastic model . As for the IBM , we then use a Latin Hypercube Sampling ( LHS ) strategy for finding the maximum log - likelihood . We fit the 12 parameters by running 15 , 000 parameter values and estimating the log - likelihood by the particle filter with 15 particles . We choose the 10 parameter values with the highest log - likelihood . Fig S8 shows the distributions of estimated parameters . We calibrate β and susceptibility for the actual strategy . For the other scenarios with a different configuration of municipalities into the regions in the model , we need modify the β values somewhat to get exactly the same epidemic trajectory as in the actual strategy . For each of the geographic patterns , we therefore fit a second scale - factor that is used August 10 , 2023 46 / 76 .

S2 Model assumptions There are some assumptions shared between 2 models . S2 . 1 Initial condition The initial conditions for the two models ( IBM and MPM ) were taken from the situational awareness model run by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health ( NIPH ) [ 43 , 50 , 51 ] . In this model , we estimated the numbers in each of the epidemiological compartments for each county in Norway based on calibration to hospital incidence . To get initial conditions on the municipality level , we distributed the county level data by population . August 10 , 2023 48 / 76 .

The age - specific probabilities of death given infection and ICU admission given hospitalization in the MPM . Probabilities of death ( % ) Probabilities of ICU admission ( % ) Age groups Without risk factors With risk factors All population 0 - 9 0 . 00006 0 . 0001 29 . 2 10 - 19 0 . 00001 0 . 00002 13 . 6 20 - 29 0 . 0008 0 . 001 8 . 4 30 - 39 0 . 001 0 . 002 11 . 8 40 - 49 0 . 007 0 . 01 13 . 8 50 - 59 0 . 03 0 . 05 21 . 0 60 - 69 0 . 2 0 . 4 27 . 0 70 - 79 1 . 5 2 . 7 28 . 2 80 + 9 . 4 17 . 3 14 . 4 We assume that the probabilities of death depend on both age and risk status while the probabilities of ICU admission depend on age only . The age - specific probabilities of death given infection are calculated based on the observed number of deaths and the estimated mean number of infections . The age - specific probabilities of ICU admission given hospitalization are calculated based on the observed numbers of ICU admissions and hospitalizations . S2 . 2 Relative regional reproduction numbers It is very difficult to accurately estimate the reproduction number in each municipality due to small number of cases . We therefore estimate and approximate relative reproduction numbers per municipality based on the total number of confirmed cases between February 2020 and May 2021 . The aim of the method is to determine what factor we need to scale the estimated national reproduction numbers to get the observed fraction of infected people in each municipality as compared to the national fraction . Since there are many small municipalities in Norway where a small outbreak can significantly affect the overall fraction of infected , we first do a simple partial - pooling analysis where we fit a simple Bayesian model of the number of observed cases in each municipality , k i by estimating a fraction , f i and combining it with the population in the municipality , p i . We use an hierarchical prior on the fractions , f i to achieve the partial pooling effect . k i ∼ NB ( p i ∗ f i , 1 / 1000 p i ) ( S40 ) f i ∼ Beta ( α , β ) ( S41 ) α ∼ N ( 1 , 0 . 4 ) ( S42 ) β ∼ N ( 100 , 20 ) ( S43 ) The model was implemented in the Stan language [ 99 ] using the rStan interface [ 100 ] . Once we have an estimated partially - pooled fraction f i for each municipality we implemented a simple SEIR model with change points for the beta - parameter with values corresponding to the estimated reproduction number in the NIPH situational awareness model [ 50 , 51 ] . The SEIR model was a simplified version of the national model described here [ 43 ] . The model had symptomatic , presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission and was seeded by data on imported cases in Norway . We assumed a detection probability of 55 % . For each of the fractions , f i , we found the scale factor s i which if applied to all the beta - values in the national model would have given a national fraction of infections equal to f i . The reproduction numbers are then normalized to be equal to or less than 1 , shown in Fig S9C . August 10 , 2023 49 / 76 .

We use a population - weighted average of the individual scale factor to estimate the relative reproduction number for these combined regions . As mentioned in the MPM section , this aggregation does not perfectly preserve the overall reproduction number , but this is fixed in the calibration step . S2 . 3 Probabilities of hospitalization We used the meta - analysis [ 49 ] for probabilities of needing hospitalization in each age group as the base values . We increased the probability for those 0 - 9 years old to the level for those 10 - 19 years old due to higher observed hospital admissions in Norway . We reduced the probability for those over 80 years old by 25 % since this proportion of elderly lived in assisted care homes or nursing homes , and they were generally not admitted to hospital for COVID - 19 but treated in the facilities in Norway . As the main wave during the simulation period ( January - July 2021 ) was contributed by the Alpha variant , we used the age - specific adjusted risk ratio of the Alpha variant compared to wild - type [ 56 ] on top of the above probabilities of hospitalization . We noted that the risk ratio could be overestimated compared to other studies in the UK [ 101 , 102 ] , Denmark [ 103 ] and some European countries [ 104 ] , and we thus applied a factor of 0 . 5 for the probability of hospitalization . In the absence of seroprevalence data , it was difficult to identify the true infection - hospitalization ratio as other studies for example in the Netherlands and Portugal [ 80 , 81 ] . Here , we included both scenarios of applying the 0 . 5 factor and without it . The latter was considered as a sensitivity analysis . The corresponding case detection fractions ( i . e . the ratios of observed cases from the data and infections from the model ) could be low and high , supported by two independent studies ( one in January 2021 [ 105 – 107 ] and one in November / December 2020 [ 108 ] ) , respectively . Furthermore , based on an analysis of Norwegian data from emergency registry Beredt C19 [ 36 ] , we found that people in risk groups had a 2 . 7 times higher likelihood of hospitalization and a 1 . 8 higher likelihood of death [ 66 ] . The analysis was based on data until November 2020 and compared the probability of hospitalization and death among those who tested positive based by risk group adjusting for age . Based on the relative sizes of the risk groups , we estimated the risk of hospitalization . Table S8 shows the age - specific probabilities of hospitalization and all the scale factors . Table S8 .

The total probabilities were scaled by the halved risk ratio ( RR ) of the Alpha variant compared to the wild - type [ 56 ] . The probabilities for the risk groups were 2 . 7 times higher [ 66 ] , and those for non - risk groups were adjusted to the lower values accordingly . August 10 , 2023 50 / 76 .

Fig S10 shows the daily numbers with rolling averages , cumulative numbers , geographic distribution and age distributions of the 4 outcomes . Cases are defined as people who tested positive with a PCR test in Norway by date of testing . Hospitalizations include all admissions where COVID - 19 was the main cause for the admission as determined by the doctor and where the date of admission and testing positive was after the 1st of January 2021 . The number of ICU admissions are patients who tested positive and where admitted to an ICU after the 1st of January 2021 . Deaths are COVID - 19 associated deaths , defined as deaths reported by doctors as due to COVID - 19 or as deaths with COVID - 19 as the cause of death on the death certificate . We included COVID - 19 associated deaths where the date of test and date of death was after the 1st of January 2021 . Fig S10 . The observed data from January to July 2021 in Norway .

The data from January to July 2021 shows that 45 . 1 % , 38 . 6 % , 9 . 9 % and 6 . 2 % of the cases were infected within households , in community , workplaces and schools , respectively . Community transmission refers to all routes ( e . g . public event , private arrangement , prison , health institution , organized leisure activity , private event in public place , travel , collection in private homes , restaurant , bar , nightclub and public transport ) other than households , schools or workplaces as the categorization in the individual - based model ( IBM ) . Additionally , we note that the data of importation used in both models are shown Fig S2F . S3 . 3 Vaccination data SYSVAK is a national , electronic immunization registry that records an individual’s vaccination status and vaccination coverage in Norway [ 40 ] . The data were aggregated by date , municipality , age and risk status . Fig S11A shows the total number of first doses distributed from January to July in 2021 in Norway is about 3 . 5M . Fig S11B shows the age - specific coverage from January to July in 2021 , and Fig S9D shows the geographic distribution of coverage . The models used the normalized data according to the synthetic population to match with the vaccination coverage . Fig S11 . The vaccination data from SYSVAK . A : The cumulative number of first doses distributed nationally . The number of first doses per day taken from historical data is shared in all scenarios . B : The age - and risk - specific vaccination coverage . The coverage of each group from low to high is shown by color from gray to blue . The age prioritization is shown in Table S10 . S4 Vaccination strategies The distribution of all vaccine doses follows a prioritization process . Firstly , doses are allocated to different regions based on geographic prioritization , and secondly , within each region , doses are prioritized based on age ( and risk ) of individuals . Fig S12 illustrates the distribution of relative reproduction numbers for municipalities grouped by priority level ( Plus , Minus , and Neutral ) for each of the 15 selection strategies . The original selection strategy ( ∆ n = 0 ) is based on the real August 10 , 2023 53 / 76 .

The Plus group comprises municipalities with the highest regional reproduction numbers , while the Neutral group may not necessarily be located between the Plus and Minus groups . Table S9 presents the number of municipalities and their corresponding adult population fractions in each priority group . Fig S12 . The relative reproduction number distribution of municipalities in alternative strategies . 356 municipalities with their own relative reproduction numbers are classified into 3 groups : Minus , Neutral and Plus colored in green , orange and blue . Each strategy has different numbers of municipalities in the three groups . The original prioritization ( ∆ n = 0 ) is the selection in the real implementation . The index of moves of municipality priority ∆ n is shown in brackets , and the number of municipalities in each group are shown accordingly on each panel title . Fig S13 shows the total number of prioritized vaccine doses shifted from the Minus to the Plus group for all alternative strategies . The most extreme strategy ( ∆ p = 300 % and ∆ n = − 25 ) prioritizes 3 million doses to 12 municipalities in the Plus group . However , for each ∆ n , there exists a maximum threshold of ∆ p , as shown in Table S9 . The smaller population size in the Minus group limits the total number of doses that can be prioritized to the Plus group . The percentage of extra prioritized doses can only reach a maximum of ∆ p = 70 % by moving 40 municipalities from the Minus group ( ∆ n = + 40 ) in one extreme direction . Conversely , prioritized doses can reach up to ∆ p = 300 % by moving 30 municipalities from the Plus group ( ∆ n = − 30 ) in another extreme direction . Table S10 shows the age prioritization categories for different risk groups and their corresponding population sizes . Within each region , vaccines are distributed according to these priority groups . However , in reality , a portion of vaccine doses are allocated to healthcare workers , who face higher risk due to their front - line roles , while simultaneously prioritizing the elderly . The NIPH modeling report [ 70 ] determined the age prioritization for the general population . Notably , those aged 25 - 39 years old are the lowest priority group , after individuals aged 18 - 24 years old .

Their approximate population are shown accordingly . of extra doses ( ∆ p ) is varied while municipality priority moves are fixed ( ∆ n = − 25 ) . The geographic prioritization of vaccine distribution can ultimately influence age - based prioritization . For instance , without geographic prioritization ( ∆ p = 0 ) , all individuals aged 80 years and above can receive their first dose by March . Conversely , under the most extreme strategy ( ∆ p = 300 % ) , they can receive it by April . There are switches between strategies for other age groups , such as in mid - February and early April for those aged 70 - 79 and 60 - 69 years old , respectively .

The number of prioritized doses distributed from the Minus group to the Plus group in the alternative strategies . The color shows the number of doses from low to high by color blue to yellow . The baseline strategy without geographic prioritization on the first column ( ∆ n = 0 % ) refers to no doses being prioritized . The y - axis shows the population fractions ( % ) of three groups ( Minus , Neutral , and Plus ) for each shift in municipality priority ( ∆ n ) . The geographic distribution of municipality priority ( ∆ n ) can be found in Fig 2 . The maximum thresholds of ∆ p can be found in Table S9 . that the results from the IBM refer to the timing of vaccination , while those from the MPM indicate the timing of vaccine effectiveness , resulting in a time delay between the two models . S5 The scenario without vaccination We considered a scenario without vaccination to show the effect of the mass vaccination program . In the absence of vaccination , as shown in Table S11 , all infections , hospitalizations , ICU admissions , and deaths were higher than in scenarios where vaccination was implemented . All RRR were negative . In the IBM , the mean RRR ( and their 95 % CIs ) were - 5 . 8 ( - 6 . 3 to - 5 . 4 ) % , - 17 . 2 ( - 17 . 7 to - 16 . 7 ) % , - 20 . 0 ( - 20 . 7 to - 19 . 4 ) % , and - 80 . 7 ( - 82 . 1 to - 79 . 3 ) % , corresponding to 13 , 734 ( 12 , 723 to 14 , 746 ) more infections , 455 ( 443 to 469 ) more hospitalizations , 103 ( 100 to 106 ) more ICU admissions , and 190 ( 187 to 194 ) more deaths than the baseline strategy , respectively . In the MPM , the mean RRR ( and their 95 % CIs ) were - 13 . 5 ( - 13 . 9 to - 13 . 1 ) % , - 26 . 4 ( - 26 . 9 to - 25 . 9 ) % , - 28 . 7 ( - 29 . 4 to - 27 . 9 ) % , and - 106 . 0 ( - 107 . 0 to - 104 . 0 ) % , corresponding to 26 , 246 ( 25 , 476 to 27 , 017 ) more infections , 574 ( 563 to 586 ) more hospitalizations , 118 ( 115 to 121 ) more ICU admissions , and 252 ( 249 to 255 ) more deaths than the baseline strategy , respectively .

The age - specific vaccination coverage in the alternative strategies . Each line in different colors shows a strategy of alternative ratio of extra doses ( ∆ p ) given fixed moves of municipality priority ( ∆ n = − 25 % ) . The blue and red color present lower and higher levels of geographic prioritization , respectively . Given a higher level of geographic prioritization , the priority of the older people is lower , for example fewer doses are distributed to those above 80 years old during the first few months .

S7 Sensitivity analysis In this sensitivity analysis , the entire analysis was performed without the factor of 0 . 5 on the probabilities of hospitalization . We found that our results are not sensitive to the factor of 0 . 5 on the probabilities of hospitalization by obtaining similar results in both IBM and MPM . Both models are re - calibrated that 12 free parameters were estimated by fitting to the daily and age - specific hospital admissions using Latin hypercube sampling ( LHS ) and least squares method .

The probabilities calculated based on the ratios of observed number of deaths to the estimated mean number of infections . Fig S22A and Fig S23A show the distributions of calibrated parameters and the fits to observed data from the IBM . Fig S22B and Fig S23B show the ones from the MPM .

The lines show the model fits with their 50 and 95 % prediction intervals represented by gray areas . The dots show the observed data . B : The age distribution of total counts . C : The geographic - specific priority distribution of total counts . The gray bars show the counts of each simulation and the full bars with black borders show the mean of all simulations . The data are shown in dots with their exact numbers . Fig S24 . The mean relative risk reduction ( RRR ) of health outcomes from both ( Left ) IBM and ( Right ) MPM in the alternative strategies given doubled hospitalization probabilities . The mean RRR of infections , hospitalizations , ICU admissions and deaths from negative to positive is represented by color from red to blue . The empty circles represent the best strategies for the highest RRR of each target . For minimizing infections , hospitalizations or ICU admissions , the higher prioritization is associated with the higher RRR . For minimizing deaths , the highest level of prioritization leads to a negative impact and medium levels of prioritization correspond to the highest RRR . The y - axis shows the population fractions ( % ) of three groups ( Minus , Neutral , and Plus ) for each shift in municipality priority ( ∆ n ) . The geographic distribution of municipality priority ( ∆ n ) can be found in Fig 2 . August 10 , 2023 66 / 76 .
