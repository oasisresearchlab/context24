Results : We identified a recycling sorting signal recognized by ACAP1 and showed that this binding is regulated by autoinhibition . Conclusion : The mechanistic understanding of regulated cargo binding has been advanced . Significance : We elucidated a key regulatory juncture that controls integrin recycling . Coat complexes sort protein cargoes into vesicular transport pathways . An emerging class of coat components has been the GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) that act on the ADP - ribosy - lation factor ( ARF ) family of small GTPases . ACAP1 ( ArfGAP withcoiled - coil , ankyrinrepeat , andPHdomainsprotein1 ) isan ARF6 GAP that also acts as a key component of a recently defined clathrin complex for endocytic recycling . Phosphoryla - tion by Akt has been shown to enhance cargo binding by ACAP1 in explaining how integrin recycling is an example of regulated transport . We now shed further mechanistic insights into how this regulation is achieved at the level of cargo binding by ACAP1 . We initially defined a critical sequence in the cytoplas - mic domain of integrin (cid:2) 1 recognized by ACAP1 and showed that this sequence acts as a recycling sorting signal . We then pursued a combination of structural , modeling , and functional studies , whichsuggestthatphosphorylationofACAP1relievesa localized mechanism of autoinhibition in regulating cargo bind - ing . Thus , wehaveelucidatedakeyregulatoryjuncturethatcon - trols integrin recycling and also advanced the understanding of how regulated cargo binding can lead to regulated transport . Intracellular transport can be divided into two general types , constitutive versus regulated transport . Studies on constitutive transport events have been at the forefront in advancing a mechanistic understanding of how vesicular transport is achieved . In particular , coat complexes are now appreciated to act as the core machinery in initiating transport . They accom - plish this role through two major functions , membrane defor - mation to achieve vesicle formation and cargo sorting that directs the proper packaging of cargoes into vesicles . A detailed mechanistic understanding of how coat components act in either process has been achieved in recent years ( 1 , 2 ) . In com - parison , although regulated transport is appreciated to underlie multiple physiologic events , how this type of transport can be achieved by regulating the function of a coat component has been less clear . One of the key physiologic examples of regulated trans - port has been the stimulation - dependent recycling of surface integrins . This process is critical for cell migration because it underlies the dynamic redistribution of surface integrins to the leading edge of cells in achieving directional migration ( 3 – 5 ) . As such , there has been intense interest in identifying the signaling components and the transport factors that act in this event . With respect to the transport factors , recent advances have led to the identification of core effectors pre - dicted to mediate the different mechanistic steps of integrin recycling ( 6 – 9 ) . Moreover , small GTPases and their catalytic regulators that modulate these core effectors are also being elucidated ( 10 – 15 ) . Distilled to its mechanistic core , regulated transport involves upstream signaling impacting on downstream transport events . Key factors that act at the interface of these two general events have been identified in the case of integrin recycling . Different growth factors have been found to instigate a canonical signal - ing cascade that results in the protein kinase Akt phosphory - lating ACAP1 at Ser - 554 , which results in the enhanced binding of ACAP1 to integrin (cid:2) 1 at the recycling endosome in stimu - lating integrin recycling ( 16 ) . * Thisworkwassupported , inwholeorinpart , byNationalInstitutesofHealth GrantGM073016 .

AUGUST 17 , 2012• VOLUME 287•NUMBER 34 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 28675 ACAP1 is a member of the ADP - ribosylation factor ( ARF ) 6 GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) family ( 17 ) . ARF GAPs have been known conventionally as regulators of their cognate small GTPases ( 18 ) . However , multiple members of this family have been discovered to possess also a novel function as ARF effec - tors , which involves their roles as coat components ( 19 – 23 ) . In particular , ACAP1 is an ARF6 GAP that has been found to function also as a component of a recently defined clathrin complex for endocytic recycling ( 6 ) . As such , the discovery that regulated cargo binding by ACAP1 underlies how integrin recy - cling is regulated ( 16 ) represents one of the best characterized examples of how regulated transport can be achieved by mod - ulating a coat component . In this study , we advance a further mechanistic understanding of this key example of regulated transport . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Chemicals , Proteins , and Cells —Protein A / G - agarose beads were obtained from Pierce . Glutathione - Sepharose 4B and Pre - Scission protease were from GE Healthcare . GST fusion pro - teins were purified as described previously ( 24 ) . His 6 - tagged full - length ACAP1 has been described previously ( 24 ) . Recom - binant forms of ACAP1 truncations were generated by initially expressing them as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and then purified by binding to glutathione - Sepharose resin fol - lowed by PreScission protease cleavage according to the man - ufacturer’s protocol . A peptide containing 12 residues within the cytoplasmic domain of integrin (cid:2) 1 ( H 2 N - HDRREFAKFEKE - OH ) was obtained from CHI Scientific , Inc . ( Maynard , MA ) . Another peptide derived from the cytoplasmic domain of Wbp1 has been described ( 25 ) . HeLa cells were cultured based on the guidelines of American Type Culture Collection . Antibodies —The following antibodies have been described previously ( 11 ) : mouse TS2 / 16 against integrin (cid:2) 1 , mouse 9E10 against the Myc epitope , and rabbit antiserum against ACAP1 . Additional antibodies used in this study include mouse 6C5 against GAPDH ( Applied Biosystems ) ; mouse SAM1 against human integrin (cid:3) 5 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) ; secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase , Cy3 , or Cy5 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) , and Alexa Fluor 546 - conjugated transferrin ( Invitrogen ) . Plasmids , Mutagenesis , and Transfections —The Myc - tagged forms of ACAP1 , wild - type and mutant ( residues 525 – 566 deleted , (cid:2) Linker ) , were subcloned into the SalI and BamHI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 . 1 for transfec - tion studies . The cDNA sequences of different ACAP1 forms were amplified by PCR and then subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI / SalI sites of the bacterial expression vector pGEX - 6P - 1 ( GE Healthcare ) to generate recombinant proteins . To generate different forms of the cytoplasmic domain of integrin (cid:2) 1 fused to GST , the cDNA sequence of (cid:2) 1 was amplified by PCR and then subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX - 4T - 3 vector ( GE Healthcare ) . Fusion constructs consisting of the (cid:2) 1 cargo peptide ( HDRREFAKFEKE ) fused to the C termi - nus of the S554D mutant of the C - terminal portion or the linker mutant were generated by adding an intervening flexible linker ( GSSNSGSNSG ) using the method of overlap PCR . All site - directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange II XL site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) according to manufacturer’s guidelines . Transient transfec - tions were carried out using FuGENE 6 ( Roche Applied science ) . shRNA and Stable Cell Lines —Nucleotides 224 – 244 of human integrin (cid:2) 1 were targeted for shRNA ( 5 (cid:3) - GCCCUCCA - GAUGACAUAGAAA ; Thermal Scientific ) . To generate shRNA - resistant forms of human integrin (cid:2) 1 , point mutations were introduced within the sequence targeted by shRNA ( nucleotides 224 – 244 ) . The specific mutations are shown underlined in the following sequence : GCCCTCCTG - ACGATATCGAAA . For the stable expression of the shRNA sequence in HeLa cells , a lentiviral expression system ( Thermal Scientific ) was used according to the guidelines provided by the manufacturer . To generate shRNA - resistant forms of human integrin (cid:2) 1 , the mutated sequences were subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pENTR plasmid ( Invitrogen ) , followed by recombi - nation with the pLenti6 . 2 plasmid ( Invitrogen ) . Lentiviral par - ticles that express different shRNA - resistant forms of human integrin (cid:2) 1 were generated using the ViraPower lentiviral expression system ( Invitrogen ) and blasticidin ( Invitrogen ) at 10 (cid:4) g / ml for selection after viral transduction . In Vivo Assays —Colocalization studies using laser confocal microscopy have been described previously ( 24 ) . To assess the association of endosomal (cid:2) 1 with ACAP1 , a co - precipitation approach was performed as described previously ( 16 ) . The endocytic recycling of (cid:2) 1 was assessed using a previously established recycling assay ( 11 , 16 ) . Briefly , the anti - (cid:2) 1 anti - body ( TS2 / 16 ) was bound to the surface of starved HeLa cells at 4 °C for 1 h , followed by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C to allow the accumulation of surface integrin at the recycling endosome . Cells were rinsed three times with ice - cold PBS and then washed twice with an acidic buffer ( 0 . 5 % glacial acetic acid ( pH 3 . 0 ) and 0 . 5 M NaCl ) to release the remaining antibody - bound surface (cid:2) 1 . Cells were then stimulated for recycling by incuba - tion with prewarmed ( 37 °C ) medium containing 20 % FCS . At different time points as indicated , cells were subjected to a sec - ond acid wash to release antibody bound to any internalized (cid:2) 1 that had recycled to the cell surface . Cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated by antibody - bound (cid:2) 1 using protein A / G - agarose beads . Analysis was performed by SDS - PAGE under nonreducing conditions , as the TS2 / 16 antibody works only for immunoblotting under these conditions . To examine the recycling of mutant (cid:2) 1 ( lacking the linker region ) under basal conditions , primaquine was added as described previously ( 16 ) . Briefly , because the ACAP1 mutant converts (cid:2) 1 recycling from regulated transport to constitutive transport , primaquine ( 0 . 3 m M ) was added to accumulate endo - cytic (cid:2) 1 at the recycling endosome . This pool of (cid:2) 1 was then examined for recycling upon the washout of primaquine . Pulldown Assays —Pulldown assays using GST fusion pro - teins were carried out as described previously ( 6 ) . Briefly , GST fusion proteins on glutathione beads were incubated with sol - 6 Theabbreviationsusedare : ARF , ADP - ribosylationfactor ; GAP , GTPase - acti - vating protein . Autoinhibition of ACAP1 28676 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 287•NUMBER 34• AUGUST 17 , 2012 uble proteins ( 4 n M ) at 4 °C for 1 h in 0 . 5 ml of incubation buffer ( 50 m M HEPES ( pH 7 . 3 ) , 300 m M NaCl , 90 m M KCl , 1 m M EDTA , and 0 . 5 % Nonidet P - 40 ) . Beads were then pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 (cid:4) g for 1 min at 4 °C , followed by two washes with incubation buffer and analysis by SDS - PAGE Western blotting . Coomassie Blue staining was carried out to detect the level of GST fusion proteins on beads . Peptide com - petition was performed as described previously ( 25 ) . Protein Preparation and Crystallization —The different forms of ACAP1 were expressed in E . coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) using vector pGEX - 6P - 1 induced at 16 °C for 18 h with 0 . 2 m M isopropyl (cid:2) - D - thiogalactopyranoside . The harvested cells were broken by sonication in PBS containing 140 m M NaCl , 2 . 7 m M KCl , 10 m M Na 2 HPO 4 , and 1 . 8 m M KH 2 PO 4 ( pH 7 . 0 ) . After centrifugation for 30 min at 14 , 000 rpm , the supernatant was incubated with glutathione - Sepharose 4B at 4 °C . After remov - ing the GST tag , the proteins were further purified by anion exchange chromatography ( Resource Q , GE Healthcare ) with a 0 – 1000 m M gradient of NaCl in 20 m M Tris ( pH 8 . 5 ) and 10 % glycerol and by size exclusion chromatography ( Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL , GE Healthcare ) . Recombinant proteins were then concentrated to 3 mg / ml in 20 m M Tris ( pH 8 . 5 ) . Preliminary conditions were screened with an Index kit ( Hampton Research ) and then optimized . Crystals were grown in reservoir solution containing 0 . 2 M ammonium sulfate , 0 . 1 M sodium cit - rate ( pH 5 . 0 – 5 . 1 ) , and 14 – 16 % PEG 3350 at 16 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method . Data Collection and Structure Determination —Crystals of the wild - type C - terminal portion were flash - frozen in reservoir solution and 25 % glycerol . Single - wavelength anomalous dif - fraction data of the ACAP1 C - terminal domain were collected to 2 . 2 Å at beamline BL17A ( Quantum - 270 CCD detector ) of the Photon Factory in Japan . Crystals of the C - terminal portion with the S554D point mutation and also the fusion construct ( S554D - (cid:2) 1 ) were soaked in 0 . 2 M ammonium sulfate , 0 . 1 M sodium citrate ( pH 5 . 1 ) , and 20 % PEG 8000 for 1 h and were frozen in liquid nitrogen in the same cryoprotecting solution as the wild type . Data were collected at beamline BL17U of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility in China . All data were processed with the HKL2000 program suite ( 26 ) . The internal zinc ion positions were determined using the program SHELXD ( 27 ) . The identified heavy atoms were refined , and initial phases were generated using the program SOLVE ( 28 ) with the single - wavelength anomalous diffraction experimental phasing module . Phase improvement , density modification , and a crude model were traced automatically using the program RESOLVE ( 29 ) . OASIS ( 30 ) , DM ( 31 ) , RESOLVE , and OASIS - DM - ARP / wARP ( 32 ) iterative methods were used to further improve the phases and to complete the model . Loops that were not built automatically were then man - ually built and refined in Coot ( 33 ) . Structure refinement was done using Refmac ( 34 ) or CNS ( 35 ) . The initial phase of the C - terminal portion with the S554D point mutation and also of the fusion construct was calculated by molecular replacement using Phaser ( 36 ) based on the wild - type form of the C - terminal portion as the model . The data processing and structure refine - ment statistics are listed in Table 1 . Surface and ribbon repre - sentations of molecular structures were generated using PyMOL . Molecular Modeling of the Linker Region —The linker region ( residues 525 – 568 ) was modeled using the crystal structure of the fusion construct as the template . This region was divided into multiple five - residue segments , which were then sequen - tially elongated toward the N - or C - terminal direction . The initial conformation of each segment was obtained by searching for homologous sequences in the Protein Data Bank . Possible positions of the each segment were then searched using the flexible docking program AutoDock4 ( 37 ) and the protein structure modeling program Modeler ( 38 ) . The most closely related model was retained . After each elongation , energy minimization was performed to optimize the position of the newly added segment . These steps were repeated until the entire region was built . The final models were then opti - mized using further energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulations . All energy minimization and molecular dynamics simula - tions were performed with NAMD ( 39 ) and the CHARMM all - atom force field for protein ( 40 ) with CMAP corrections . For the molecular dynamics simulations , the final models were solvated with TIP3P water boxes , and the systems were then neutralized with Na (cid:5) and Cl (cid:6) ions . At the periodic boundary condition , a 12 - Å cutoff was used for van der Waals interac - tions , and particle mesh Ewald summation was used to calcu - late the electrostatic interactions in all simulations . Tempera - ture was controlled at 310 K using Langevin dynamics with the damping coefficient 1 / ps , and pressure was controlled at 1 atm by the Langevin piston method . The backbone atoms observed in the crystal structures were fixed during the simulations . For each model , 20 ns of simulation was carried out , and the final snapshot was taken for analysis and comparison . Accession Codes —The coordinates of the C - terminal portion ( wild - type and S554D ) and the S554D - (cid:2) 1 fusion construct have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 3JUE , 4F1P , and 3T9K , respectively . RESULTS ACAP1 Binds to a Sequence in (cid:2) 1 That Acts as a Recycling Sorting Signal —Experimentally , cargo sorting requires the demonstration that a coat component binds to a specific sequence in the cargo and also that this sequence is required for targeting the cargo into a particular intracellular pathway . In this regard , although we had previously found that ACAP1 binds directly to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin (cid:2) 1 , the precise sequence in (cid:2) 1 recognized by ACAP1 and whether this sequence acts functionally as a recycling sorting signal had not been determined . Thus , we first sought to address these questions . Previous studies have examined HeLa cells to elucidate how ACAP1 acts in integrin recycling ( 6 , 16 ) . In these cells , (cid:2) 1 pairs mainly with (cid:3) 5 in forming functional integrin heterodimers that recognize fibronectin as the ligand . Thus , we first con - firmed that ACAP1 interacts directly with the cytoplasmic domain of (cid:2) 1 , but not with the cytoplasmic domain of (cid:3) 5 ( Fig . 1 A ) . We next generated progressive truncations for the cyto - plasmic domain of (cid:2) 1 from either its membrane - proximal or Autoinhibition of ACAP1 AUGUST 17 , 2012• VOLUME 287•NUMBER 34 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 28677 C - terminal end ( Fig . 1 B ) . These constructs were then analyzed as GST fusion proteins for binding to ACAP1 ( Fig . 1 C ) , which suggested that a region in (cid:2) 1 encompassed by residues 8 – 17 is critical for its direct binding to ACAP1 . To further pinpoint the critical residues , we next generated a series of alanine - scanning mutants in the context of the entire cytoplasmic domain of integrin (cid:2) 1 . Focusing on the region encompassed by residues 8 – 17 , we systematically replaced paired native residues with paired alanines . With further analysis , we defined a region in (cid:2) 1 encompassed by residues 10 – 15 as being the most critical in mediating the direct binding of the (cid:2) 1 cargo by ACAP1 ( Fig . 1 D ) . We then examined whether these residues in (cid:2) 1 act func - tionally as a recycling sorting signal . Stable cell lines were gen - erated in which endogenous (cid:2) 1 was replaced with transfected forms ( Fig . 2 A ) . This was accomplished using a lentiviral system that expressed shRNA directed against endogenous (cid:2) 1 and that also stably expressed either wild - type or mutant ( with residues 10 – 15 in the cytoplasmic domain mutated to alanines ) (cid:2) 1 that was siRNA - resistant . Co - precipitation analysis confirmed that the (cid:2) 1 mutant could still pair with (cid:3) 5 in forming heterodimers ( Fig . 2 B ) . Moreover , the mutant heterodimers had levels at the cell surface that were similar to that of the wild type ( Fig . 2 C ) . Additionally , similar to the wild type , a surface pool of the mutant integrin could be tracked to accumulate at the recycling endosome under basal conditions ( Fig . 2 D ) . We then examined the recycling efficiency of the mutant from this internal compartment using a previously established integrin recycling assay ( 11 , 16 ) . Briefly , an antibody was used to bind to the surface pool of integrin (cid:2) 1 . Under basal conditions , this surface pool underwent internalization and then accumu - lated the recycling endosome . Upon stimulation by serum ( or by specific growth factors ) , this pool of (cid:2) 1 was induced to recy - cle to the cell surface . Using this assay , we found that the (cid:2) 1 mutant exhibited a reduced ability to recycle ( Fig . 3 A ) . We also confirmed that the (cid:2) 1 mutant exhibited defective binding to ACAP1 in vivo , which involved a co - precipitation approach to detect ACAP1 binding to the endosomal pool of (cid:2) 1 ( Fig . 3 B ) . Thus , we concluded that the residues in the cytoplasmic domain of (cid:2) 1 critical for direct binding to ACAP1 also function as a recycling sorting signal . C - terminal Portion of ACAP1 Recapitulates Regulated Cargo Binding —We next sought to define the region in ACAP1 responsible for its direct binding to the (cid:2) 1 cargo . ACAP1 is predicted to possess four domains ( Fig . 4 A ) , the BAR ( Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ) , PH ( pleckstrin homology ) , GAP , and ANK ( ankyrin repeat ) domains ( 17 ) . We initially sought to generate each domain separately . However , the GAP domain was found to be unstable . Pursuing an explanation , we noted that the domain organization of ACAP1 was predicted to be similar to that of ASAP2 ( previously known as Pap - (cid:2) ) and ASAP3 ( 17 ) . The structure of the GAP and ANK domains in these ARF GAPs had been solved ( 41 , 42 ) , suggesting that the ANK domain acts as a scaffold in stabilizing the folding of the GAP domain . Thus , we next generated the GAP - ANK domains of ACAP1 ( referred to as the C - terminal portion of ACAP1 ) , which was successfully purified as a recombinant protein . We also generated the remaining portions of ACAP1 , consisting of its BAR and PH domains ( referred to as the N - terminal por - tion ) . Both portions of ACAP1 were then assessed for their ability to bind to the (cid:2) 1 cargo in a pulldown experiment . This analysis revealed that the C - terminal portion bound to the (cid:2) 1 cargo significantly better than the N - terminal portion ( Fig . 4 B ) . We also found that the ANK domain alone showed a markedly reduced ability to bind (cid:2) 1 ( Fig . 4 C ) . Thus , the results led us to focus on the C - terminal portion construct for further studies on cargo binding . We had found previously that the mutation of Ser - 554 in ACAP1 to aspartate ( S554D ) , which mimicked constitutive phosphorylation , enhanced cargo binding ( 16 ) . When this mutation was introduced into the C - terminal portion , we found that binding to (cid:2) 1 was also enhanced ( Fig . 4 D ) . In further sup - port of the functional relevance of this binding , we found that mutating the recycling sorting signal in (cid:2) 1 reduced the ability of the S554D mutation to enhance cargo binding by the C - termi - nal portion ( Fig . 4 D ) . We also performed a competition exper - iment and confirmed that a peptide encompassing the recycling sorting signal in (cid:2) 1 eliminated enhanced cargo binding of the C - terminal portion induced by the S554D mutation ( Fig . 4 E ) .

Autoinhibition of ACAP1 28678 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 287•NUMBER 34• AUGUST 17 , 2012 Thus , as the C - terminal portion recapitulated how cargo bind - ing is achieved by ACAP1 , we next pursued structural analysis of this construct . Structural Analysis of the C - terminal Portion —We initially attempted to solve the crystal structure of the C - terminal por - tion using the molecular replacement method , reasoning that the GAP - ANK domains of ASAP2 and ASAP3 had been solved previously and thus could be used as models ( 41 , 42 ) . How - ever , this approach failed , predicting that the corresponding domains in ACAP1 possessed more differences than antici - pated . Next , pursuing anomalous diffraction based on the zinc ion coordinated in the GAP domain , we solved the crystal struc - ture of the C - terminal portion to 2 . 2 Å resolution ( Table 1 ) . Of the 363 residues in the C - terminal portion ( residues 378 – 740 ) , those that resided in the GAP or ANK domain could be clearly traced ( 250 residues ) . Residues that could not be traced resided in a region N - terminal to the GAP domain ( residues 378 – 403 ) , a region C - terminal to the ANK domain ( residues 698 – 740 ) , and a region between the GAP and ANK domains ( residues 525 – 568 ) . The general features of the GAP and ANK domains were similar to those of the corresponding domains in ASAP2 and ASAP3 ( 41 , 42 ) . The GAP domain of ACAP1 exhibits a three - stranded (cid:2) - sheet flanked by five (cid:3) - helices on three sides ( Fig . 5 A ) . A zinc ion is well coordinated by four cysteines ( Cys - 420 , Cys - 423 , Cys - 440 , and Cys - 443 ) , which reside within a con - served GATA - like motif ( Cys - X 2 - Cys - X 16 - Cys - X 2 - Cys ) . The ANK domain contains four ankyrin repeats ( Fig . 5 A ) , forming an elongated structure with approximate dimensions of 45 (cid:4) 25 (cid:4) 20 Å 3 . Each repeat consists of the ubiquitous (cid:2) - hairpin - helix - loop - helix motif , and their adjacent long loops form the (cid:2) - hairpin motif and are stabilized by hydrogen bonds .

Autoinhibition of ACAP1 28680 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 287•NUMBER 34• AUGUST 17 , 2012 ices proximal to the (cid:2) - hairpin motif are shorter than the helices on the distal side . As a result , a concave surface facing the tips of the (cid:2) - hairpin is formed . The C - terminal portion also possesses features that could explain why the molecular replacement method could not be used to solve its structure based on the corresponding domains of ASAP2 / 3 . The root mean square deviation of the GAP domains between ACAP1 and ASAP2 is 1 . 6 Å for 118 C (cid:3) atoms . When ACAP1 , ASAP2 , and ASAP3 were superimposed with respect to their ANK domains , the GAP domain of ACAP1 exhibited significant displacement . As a result , the angle spanned by the ANK and GAP domains of ACAP1 was increased by (cid:11) 20° compared with those of ASAP2 and ASAP3 ( Fig . 5 B ) . Also , loop 1 , which connects helices 4 and 5 in the GAP domain of ACAP1 , differed significantly from the corre - sponding regions of ASAP2 and ASAP3 ( Fig . 5 B ) . Furthermore , FIGURE 5 .

Autoinhibition of ACAP1 AUGUST 17 , 2012• VOLUME 287•NUMBER 34 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 28681 although the ANK domains of all three ARF GAPs exhibited similar general features , their predicted electrostatic surfaces showed obvious differences ( Fig . 5 C ) . Linker Region between the GAP and ANK Domains Regulates Cargo Binding —We next sought insight into how cargo binding is accomplished by ACAP1 by attempting to solve a co - crystal structure consisting of the C - terminal portion bound to the (cid:2) 1 cargo peptide . However , repeated trials using different lengths of the (cid:2) 1 peptide , introduction of the S554D mutation to enhance (cid:2) 1 binding , and also changing crystallization condi - tions failed to achieve this goal . A general approach to over - come such an obstacle has been to fuse the interacting partners covalently , which further enhances their interaction . Thus , we next pursued this approach by fusing the (cid:2) 1 peptide to the C terminus of the C - terminal portion and also introducing the S554D mutation to further enhance cargo binding ( S554D - (cid:2) 1 ) . We then sought to crystallize this fusion construct . In this effort , we had to overcome the tendency of the (cid:2) 1 peptide to become cleaved during the prolonged incubation needed for crystallization . Eventually , we solved the fusion construct to 2 . 2 Å resolution ( Table 1 ) . It was found to superimpose quite well with the wild - type counterpart ( Fig . 6 A ) , with a root mean square deviation of 0 . 46 Å for 249 C (cid:3) atoms ( residues 405 – 524 and 569 – 697 ) . However , we still could not visualize the (cid:2) 1 cargo peptide in this structure . We confirmed by a functional assay that the fusion construct resulted in the C - terminal portion binding to the fused (cid:2) 1 pep - tide . Whereas the S554D mutant alone could bind GST - (cid:2) 1 on beads in a pulldown assay , the fusion construct showed marked reduced ability ( Fig . 6 B ) . We pursued two additional approaches , which also suggested that the fusion construct was active . First , by solving the S554D mutation without the fused (cid:2) 1 peptide ( Table 1 ) and by comparing with the fusion con - struct , we found that they were virtually superimposable ( Fig . 6 C ) . Thus , as the S554D mutant form of the C - terminal portion is active in cargo binding ( see Fig . 4 ) , the fusion construct is also likely active . Second , we noted that an additional helix ( (cid:3) 14 ) became detectable in the fusion construct compared with the S554D construct without the fused (cid:2) 1 peptide ( Fig . 6 C ) . This finding suggested that the fused (cid:2) 1 peptide interacted with the C - terminal portion , resulting in enhanced stability at the C ter - minus of the ANK domain , where the fusion occurred . Consist - ent with this explanation , we performed temperature factor analysis , which also predicted enhanced stability at the C ter - minus of the ANK domain ( Fig . 6 D ) . Thus , the results are con - sistent with the fusion construct leading to enhanced cargo binding of the (cid:2) 1 peptide by the C - terminal portion . A general explanation for why a portion of a crystal structure cannot be visualized is that it is too flexible , predicting that additional component ( s ) help to stabilize cargo binding by the C - terminal portion . Thus , future studies will be needed to iden - tify such predicted component ( s ) . In the meantime , we sought further mechanistic insight into how cargo binding could be regulated by Ser - 554 by considering that the S554D mutation did not induce a major conformational change within the C - terminal portion in explaining how this mutation enhanced cargo binding . We further noted that the linker region between the GAP and ANK domains , which contains Ser - 554 , could not be traced in any of the solved constructs . Thus , we next pursued molecular modeling to gain insight into whether this linker region could be involved in the regulation of cargo binding by Ser - 554 . Initially , smaller segments of the linker region were searched for homologous templates in the Protein Data Bank . These seg - ments were then modeled into longer segments using protein structure and flexible docking programs while also considering energy minimization and taking into consideration a physio - logic aqueous environment . From these analyses , the linker region was modeled to cover an adjoining region contributed mainly by helices (cid:3) 7 , (cid:3) 9 , and (cid:3) 11 of the ANK domain ( Fig . 6 E ) . In comparison , the S554D mutation was predicted to induce the linker region to tilt away from the ANK domain near helix (cid:3) 11 ( Fig . 6 E ) . Thus , molecular simulation suggested the possi - bility that the linker region could be acting as a “flap” that cov - ered the cargo binding site , with the S554D mutation inducing this flap to “uncover” from the binding site . We also examined the effect of the S554A mutation , which has been shown previously to inhibit cargo binding ( 16 ) . Com - pared with either the wild - type or S554D form , molecular sim - ulation predicted the greatest difference imposed by the S554A mutation would occur in the linker region covering the ANK domain near helix (cid:3) 7 ( Fig . 6 E ) . Future studies will be needed to elucidate how coverage in this region of the ANK domain would result in a dominant - negative inhibition of cargo binding by the S554A mutation . In the meantime , as the wild - type form of Ser - 554 is more likely to represent the physiologic unphos - phorylated state of Ser - 554 than S554A , we considered that the comparison between the wild - type form and S554D is more likely to reflect how phosphorylation at Ser - 554 affects the role of the linker region in modulating cargo binding . In particular , as comparison between the wild - type and S554D forms suggested that the linker region could be acting to inhibit cargo binding , we next sought functional support by excising this region and then assessing for cargo binding by the resulting mutant . Notably , cargo binding was enhanced , similar to that seen for the S554D mutant . This enhancement could be observed either by assessing the binding of the linker mutant to GST - (cid:2) 1 on beads in pulldown assay ( Fig . 7 A ) or in the context of a competition experiment in which the ability of a fusion construct ( composed of the linker mutant fused to the (cid:2) 1 pep - tide ) was assessed for intermolecular binding to GST - (cid:2) 1 ( Fig . 7 B ) . We also sought in vivo confirmation for the effect of excis - ing the linker region . We generated a full - length form of ACAP1 with the linker region excised . After transfection into cells , the ability of the ACAP1 mutant to bind endosomal (cid:2) 1 and its effect on (cid:2) 1 recycling were assessed . Similar to the pre - viously observed effects of the S554D mutation ( 16 ) , excision of the linker region also resulted in enhanced binding to endo - somal (cid:2) 1 under basal conditions ( Fig . 7 C ) . Moreover , the expression of this mutant in cells converted (cid:2) 1 recycling from a regulated to a constitutive ( stimulation - independent ) process ( Fig . 7 D ) , similar to that seen previously for the effect of the S554D mutant ( 16 ) . Thus , the results support the role of the linker region acting to inhibit cargo binding . Autoinhibition of ACAP1 28682 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 287•NUMBER 34• AUGUST 17 , 2012 DISCUSSION We have advanced the mechanistic understanding of how ACAP1 achieves regulated cargo sorting . Cargo sorting is defined operationally by a coat component binding to a partic - ular sequence in the cargo and by demonstrating that this sequence acts functionally as a sorting signal . Thus , we initially identified a minimal region in the (cid:2) 1 cargo recognized by ACAP1 and showed that this binding represents cargo sorting FIGURE6 .

Autoinhibition of ACAP1 AUGUST 17 , 2012• VOLUME 287•NUMBER 34 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 28683 because this minimal region acts functionally as a recycling sorting signal . We next identified a minimal region in ACAP1 that reproduces regulation of cargo binding by Ser - 554 , which involves the C - terminal portion ( composed of the GAP and ANK domains ) . We then pursued structural studies on this C - terminal por - tion . However , whereas this portion of ACAP1 could be largely solved , cargo binding of the (cid:2) 1 peptide could not be visualized , despite efforts to enhance this binding through the use of a fusion construct . Importantly , a linker region between the GAP and ANK domains containing Ser - 554 also could not be solved . Thus , to pursue further insight into how Ser - 554 regulates cargo binding , we pursued molecular modeling of the linker region . This approach suggested the possibility that the linker region could act to prevent cargo binding and that phosphory - lation at Ser - 554 could relieve this inhibition . We confirmed this autoinhibitory mechanism by excising the linker region and showing that the resulting mutant behaved similar to the S554D mutant in promoting cargo binding and integrin recycling . Autoinhibition has emerged as a common mechanism of reg - ulating the function of a protein . In most cases , however , auto - inhibition has been shown to involve large conformational changes within the protein . Key transport factors that act in this manner have included the cytohesin class of ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factors , which undergo large conforma - tional changes upon phosphorylation so that their catalytic domain can contact cognate ARFs as substrates ( 43 ) . In con - trast , our results with ACAP1 suggest a more localized mecha - nism of autoinhibition , which involves a flexible linker region between the GAP and ANK domains that acts to obstruct cargo binding , with a key residue within this region ( Ser - 554 ) regulat - ing this obstruction . Thus , our findings expand an appreciation for the mechanistic spectrum by which autoinhibition can occur in modulating the function of a transport factor . Our findings also advance a mechanistic understanding of a key regulatory juncture that controls integrin recycling . As integrin recycling is critical for cell migration , there has been great interest in identifying both upstream signaling compo - nents and downstream transport effectors of this recycling event ( 3 – 5 ) . From this effort , there has also been an elucidation of how a signaling component ( Akt ) impacts on a transport factor ( ACAP1 ) in explaining how integrin recycling involves regulated transport ( 16 ) . We have now further advanced a mechanistic understanding of this key regulatory juncture in integrin recycling .
