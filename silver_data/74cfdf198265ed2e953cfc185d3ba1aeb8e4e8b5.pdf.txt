BACKGROUND 3 Enterprise Data Analysis and Visualization : An Interview Study Sean Kandel , Andreas Paepcke , Joseph M . Hellerstein , and Jeffrey Heer Abstract —Organizations rely on data analysts to model customer engagement , streamline operations , improve production , inform business decisions , and combat fraud . Though numerous analysis and visualization tools have been built to improve the scale and efﬁciency at which analysts can work , there has been little research on how analysis takes place within the social and organizational context of companies . To better understand the enterprise analysts’ ecosystem , we conducted semi - structured interviews with 35 data analysts from 25 organizations across a variety of sectors , including healthcare , retail , marketing and ﬁnance . Based on our interview data , we characterize the process of industrial data analysis and document how organizational features of an enterprise impact it . We describe recurring pain points , outstanding challenges , and barriers to adoption for visual analytic tools . Finally , we discuss design implications and opportunities for visual analysis research .

These organizations rely on data analysis to model customer engagement , streamline operations , improve production , inform sales and business decisions , and combat fraud . Within organizations , an in - creasing number of individuals — with varied titles such as “business analyst” , “data analyst” and “data scientist” — perform such analyses . These analysts constitute an important and rapidly growing user pop - ulation for analysis and visualization tools . Enterprise analysts perform their work within the context of a larger organization . Analysts often work as a part of an analysis team or business unit . Little research has observed how existing infrastruc - ture , available data and tools , and administrative and social conven - tions within an organization impact the analysis process within the enterprise . Understanding how these issues shape analytic workﬂows can inform the design of future tools . To better understand the day - to - day practices of enterprise analysts , we conducted semi - structured interviews with 35 analysts from sectors including healthcare , retail , ﬁnance , and social networking . We asked analysts to walk us through the typical tasks they perform , the tools they use , the challenges they encounter , and the organizational context in which analysis takes place . In this paper , we present the results and analysis of these interviews . We ﬁnd that our respondents are well - described by three archetypes that differ in terms of skill set and typical workﬂows . We ﬁnd that these archetypes vary widely in programming proﬁciency , reliance on information technology ( IT ) staff and diversity of tasks , and vary less in statistical proﬁciency . We then discuss how organizational features of an enterprise , such as the relationship between analysts and IT staff or the diversity of data sources , affect the analysis process . We also describe how collaboration takes place between analysts . We ﬁnd that analysts seldom share resources such as scripts and intermediate data products . In response , we consider possible impediments to sharing and collaboration . Next we characterize the analysis process described to us by our respondents . Our model includes ﬁve high - level tasks : discovery , wrangling , proﬁling , modeling and reporting .

We discuss recurring pain points within each task as well as difﬁculties in managing workﬂows across these tasks . Example pain points include integrating data from distributed data sources , visual - izing data at scale and operationalizing workﬂows . These challenges are typically more acute within large organizations with a diverse and distributed set of data sources . We conclude with a discussion of future trends and the implica - tions of our interviews for future visualization and analysis tools . We argue that future visual analysis tools should leverage existing infras - tructures for data processing to enable scale and limit data migration . One avenue for achieving better interoperability is through systems that specify analysis or data processing operations in a high - level lan - guage , enabling retargeting across tools or platforms . We also note that the current lack of reusable workﬂows could be improved via less intrusive methods for recording data provenance . 2 R ELATED W ORK Many researchers have studied analysts and their processes within in - telligence agencies [ 5 , 18 , 24 , 25 , 30 ] . This work characterizes in - telligence analysts’ process , discusses challenges within the process , and describes collaboration among analysts . Although there is much overlap in the high - level analytic process of intelligence and enterprise analysts , these analysts often work on different types of data with dif - ferent analytic goals and therefore perform different low - level tasks . For example , enterprise analysts more often perform analysis on struc - tured data than on documents and emails . Others have characterized tasks and challenges within the analysis process [ 1 , 21 , 26 , 34 , 35 ] . Amar et al . [ 1 ] propose a set of low - level analysis tasks based on the activities of students in an Information Vi - sualization class . Their taxonomy largely includes tasks subsumed by our proﬁle and model tasks and does not address the other tasks we have identiﬁed . Russell et al . [ 34 ] characterize high - level sensemak - ing activities necessary for analysis . We instead identify speciﬁc tasks performed by enterprise analysts . Sedlmair et al . [ 35 ] discuss difﬁ - culties evaluating visualization tools in large corporations , including acquiring and integrating data . We discuss common challenges within these subtasks . Kwon and Fisher [ 26 ] discuss challenges novices en - counter when using visual analytic tools . In contrast , our subjects are largely expert users of their tools . Fink et al . [ 9 ] performed an ethnographic study of cyber - security analysts . They ﬁnd that visual analytic tools in this domain have lim - ited interoperability with other tools , lack support for performing ad hoc transformations of data , and typically do not scale to the necessary volume and diversity of data . We ﬁnd similar issues across multiple domains . Several researchers have articulated the importance of capturing provenance to manage analytic workﬂows [ 2 , 11 , 12 , 15 ] .

Respondents , Challenges and Tools . The matrix displays interviewees ( grouped by archetype and sector ) and their corresponding chal - lenges and tools . Hackers faced the most diverse set of challenges , corresponding to the diversity of their workﬂows and toolset . Application users and scripters typically relied on the IT team to perform certain tasks and therefore did not perceive them as challenges . Hackers reported using a variety of tools for visualization , includ - ing statistical packages , Tableau , Excel , PowerPoint , D3 , and Raph¨ael . Six hackers viewed tools that produce interactive visualizations as re - porting tools and not exploratory analytics tools . Since they could not perform ﬂexible data manipulation within visualization tools they only used these tools once they knew what story they wanted to tell with the data . 4 . 1 . 2 Scripters Scripters performed most of their analysis within a software package such as R or Matlab . They were able to perform simple manipulations such as ﬁltering and aggregating data , but typically could not perform custom operations such as parsing log ﬁles or scraping data off the web . They generally operated on data that had been pulled from the data warehouse by IT staff and stored in an expected format . Some of these analysts could write simple SQL queries ( e . g . , without joins ) to pull data into their analytic tool of choice . In some cases , they were comfortable writing scripts in a scripting language , but typically do not know how to create scripts that run at scale . Scripters applied the most sophisticated models among the ana - lysts we observed . Advanced modeling was potentially enabled by the breadth of libraries available for analytic packages and the percent - age of time these analysts devoted to modeling . The implementation and application of algorithms was more easily done when dealing with data resident on one machine ( as opposed to distributed ) . Scripters often produced visualizations using the statistical package during ex - ploratory analysis . Using the same tool for visualization and analysis permitted them to iterate ﬂuidly between the two tasks . In some cases scripters used a separate tool , such as Tableau , to create interactive dashboards for reporting after the signiﬁcant insights had been discov - ered . 4 . 1 . 3 Application User The last set of analysts performed almost all operations in a spread - sheet or other dedicated analysis application ( e . g . , SAS / JMP , SPSS , etc ) . Like scripters , they typically required someone to prepare data for them by pulling it from the warehouse . One Excel user’s account was quite typical of most spreadsheet users : All data is in a relational database . When I get it , it’s out of the database and into an Excel format that I can start pivoting . I ask the IT team to pull it . Application users typically worked on smaller data sets than the other groups and generally did not export data from the spreadsheet except for building reports . In some cases , advanced application users wrote scripts using an embedded language such as Visual Basic . To produce visualizations they typically created charts in Excel or ex - ported data to a reporting tool such as Crystal Reports . 4 . 2 Organization Enterprise analysts work within the context of a larger organization . Political and social conventions within the organization can and do affect the analysis process . We now discuss three recurring themes . 4 . 2 . 1 The Relationship between Analysts and IT Staff Analysts often interacted closely with IT staff to complete aspects of their job . We observed that the IT team regularly provides four primary functions in support of analysis . First , they often maintain data within a centralized warehouse . This maintenance includes ingesting new data sources and ensuring quality across these sources . If an analyst requires new data in the warehouse , the analyst will often work with IT staff to communicate these requirements . Second , the IT team assists analysts in acquiring data . Analysts , especially application users and scripters , rely on IT staff to query data from the warehouse and export it in an accessible format . For instance , 12 analysts reported having the IT team write SQL queries and convert the output to delimited ﬁles or spreadsheets . Third , the IT team is responsible for operationalizing recurring workﬂows . One analyst at a media company described the workﬂows he built as “prototypes” . After experimenting with samples of data , the analyst would send a high - level description of the workﬂow steps — written in English — to IT staff . IT staff then implemented the process to run reliably and at scale . Even hackers relied on IT staff to oper - ationalize tasks that were critical to other business units or had chal - lenging scalability requirements . For example , one analyst at a hedge fund required the IT team to operationalize his workﬂows to achieve low - latency for high - frequency trading . Finally , the IT team serves as a source of documentation . Even ana - lysts comfortable writing complex SQL and Hadoop jobs often require IT staff to help ﬁnd the appropriate data and understand its structure INTERVIEWEES × CHALLENGES / TOOLS 5 Enterprise Data Analysis and Visualization : An Interview Study Sean Kandel , Andreas Paepcke , Joseph Hellerstein , Jeffrey Heer IEEE Visual Analytics Science & Technology ( VAST ) , 2012 “I spend more than half of my time integrating , cleansing and transforming data without doing any actual analysis .

Most of the time I’m lucky if I get to do any ‘analysis’ at all… Most of the time once you transform the data . . . the insights can be scarily obvious . ” “It is really hard to know where the data is . We have all the data , but there is no huge schema where we can say this data is here and this variable is there . ” “In practice right now the biggest differentiator is feature selection : knowing what columns to pay attention to and how to sensibly transform them . Do you take the log of these , do you combine these two ? A lot of work is just ﬁnding what the units of the columns should be . ” “The only code that doesn’t go in github is our analytics code… svn is more like backup than version control . ” “You go down a lot of dead ends , and you come up with a bunch of hypotheses . 8 out of 10 are dead ends… Especially your dead ends…there’s no remnant of that . ” “Analysts that can’t program are disenfranchised here . ” Areas : Interaction / Visualization Data Analysis Many Application Verticals Go native !
