The results demonstrate a rather uniform , and high , elongation rate at large human genes and co - transcriptional pre - mRNA splicing of both U2 - and U12 - dependent primary transcripts . In the past 30 years , a wide array of biochemical , molecular and imaging approaches have been used to estimate the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) in vivo ( Table 1 ) . Although these studies have provided rates that were critical in evaluating the mechanics and regulation of gene expression in different model organisms , their focus has primarily been on single genes and , in some cases , on non - native , engineered transcription cassettes . In an article on page 1128 of this issue 1 , Singh and Padgett examine the elongation rate of Pol II as well as the splicing kinetics of pre - mRNA at up to ten large , native genes in human cells . Interestingly , they show that the average elongation rate at the tested genes is ~ 3 . 8 kb / min , considerably higher than most previous estimates ( Table 1 ) . The attractive method described in this paper could potentially be applied generally to determine the rate of transcription and splicing kinetics at most Pol II – transcribed genes in different eukaryotic model systems . Transcription elongation by Pol II is the stage during which the Pol II molecule traverses the body of the gene to generate the pre - mRNA 2 . Until recently , it was widely believed that almost all genes were regulated at the initiation step of transcription , through recruitment of new Pol II molecules to the promoter region . However , recent genome - wide analyses have shown that many genes in higher eukaryotes are subject to regulation at the point when promoter - proximal paused Pol II enters into productive elongation 3 – 5 . Whether the transcription rate of Pol II is regulated beyond this point is still unclear . Nonetheless , the new technology of Singh and Padgett 1 provides a means for carefully assessing rates of elongation throughout the primary transcription unit . To measure the elongation rate of transcription in vivo , previous studies have focused on developmentally regulated or stimulus - responsive genes and have measured either the time for the ‘first wave’ of Pol II molecules to reach the 3 ′ end of the gene 6 – 8 or the time required for the ‘last wave’ of Pol II molecules to leave the body of the gene upon transcription shutdown 9 . These measurements , mostly carried out in Drosophila melanogaster and yeast , have estimated elongation rates to be 1 . 1 – 2 kb / min . Measurement of Pol II elongation rate in mammals has been subject to substantial Ex 1 a b c d + Remove DRB , isolate RNA every 5 min , detect nascent pre - mRNA Spliced out intron 1 DRB ( block entry into productive elongation ) Int 1 Ex 2 Int 2 Ex 1 Int 1 Ex 2 Int 2 Ex 1 Int 1 Ex 2 Int 2 Ex 1 Int 1 Ex 2 Int 2 Figure 1 Stepwise depiction of method used by Singh and Padgett to measure the elongation rate and splicing kinetics at native genes in vivo . ( a ) Initiating or 5 ′ proximally paused Pol II molecules are phosphorylated at the Ser5 residue of CTD ( green P circle ) , and phosphorylation of the Ser2 residue of CTD ( orange P circle ) by P - TEFb leads to progression into productive elongation . ( b ) Addition of the reversible P - TEFb kinase inhibitor DRB prevents the entry of hypophosphorylated Pol II molecules into productive elongation , while the hyperphosphorylated Pol II molecules are allowed to clear the body of the gene 23 . ( c ) Shifting cells to DRB - free medium allows resumption of new rounds of transcription , and the elongation rate is deduced by calculating the time that it takes to detect nascent RNA by RT - PCR using primers ( dotted arrows ) that span the exon ( Ex ) - intron ( Int ) junction at different regions of the gene ( dark gray – yellow and light gray – red primer pairs ) . ( d ) Pre - mRNA splicing kinetics are also estimated by measuring the time it takes to detect the exon 1 – intron 2 intermediate ( dark gray and red primer product ) after first detecting the exon 2 – intron 2 PCR product ( light gray and red primer product ) . n e w s a n d v i e w s © 2009 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

In addition , when coupled with knockdown of putative elongation factors , this methodology could be informative in determining the role of these factors during elongation in vivo 22 at many genes . Future experiments are likely to benefit from ( i ) substitution of DRB with flavopiridol , a more specific and potent P - TEFb inhibitor 16 , and ( ii ) the use of the absolutely shortest inhibition times needed to clear downstream elongating Pol II , in order to minimize any possible physiological perturbations caused by drug treatment . 1 .

In other words , a transcriptionally virgin chromatin landscape might pose a greater resistance to Pol II penetration through nucleosomes , leading to an overall slower apparent elongation rate . This provides an explanation of why the rate of transcription at the transcriptionally active genes these authors tested is higher than those previously measured at mostly inducible genes . Separate biochemical and imaging measurements at the major Drosophila heat shock gene , Hsp70 , suggested that elongation rates are comparable during the first wave of heat shock – induced transcription , when chromatin is in a more compact state 18 , and during steady state of transcription in a fully activated Hsp70 ( refs . 7 , 19 ) . It should be noted , however , that Hsp70 , even under non – heat shock conditions , is not truly virgin chromatin , but rather is at least modestly transcribed . In addition , a measurement of elongation rate at the inducible PKR gene made in this current study ( not using the DRB method ) estimates the elongation rate to be 3 . 3 kb / min , which is only slightly lower than the calculated 3 . 8 kb / min average . Therefore , the rate of elongation may be comparable for both the first induced and the steady state – transcribing Pol II . The differences in elongation rates between species might be understood from an evolutionary standpoint . The average lengths of mRNA - coding genes in yeast and Drosophila are 1 . 45 and 3 . 05 kb , respectively 20 , whereas the average human gene is 27 kb long 21 ( because of the many lengthy introns present ) . At the extreme , at a rate of 3 . 8 kb / min , transcription from the longest human gene , DMD ( encoding dystrophin ) , at 2 , 300 kb , would take 10 h . Therefore , it is tempting to speculate that mammals have developed mechanisms that allow Pol II to transcribe their correspondingly larger genes at higher rates . Altogether , the results of this recent study indicate that the method presented therein variation , with estimates anywhere between ~ 1 . 3 and 4 . 3 kb / min 10 – 14 . The highest rate , unlike with other estimates , was obtained by modeling calculations that removed probabilistic pausing to derive a rate for pure ‘rapid elongation’ 11 ; therefore , it was generally believed that the average elongation rate of Pol II in eukaryotic systems was in the range of 1 . 5 – 2 kb / min . In their current work , Singh and Padgett revisit and modify an old approach 15 and present an appealing method for measuring the elongation rate at endogenous genes ( Fig . 1 ) . The authors use 5 , 6 - dichloro - 1 - β - d - ribofuranosylbenzimidazole ( DRB ) , a chemical that prevents the progression of Pol II into productive elongation by inhibiting phosphorylation of Ser2 of the CTD heptapeptide repeat by P - TEFb 16 , and measure the rate of transcription elongation at a subset of relatively long genes ( ~ 100 – 580 kb ) by shifting drug - treated cells into DRB - free medium and using real - time RT - PCR to examine the emergence of nascent pre - mRNA at various exon - intron junctions ( that is , de novo transcription ) in multiple native human genes at 5 - min intervals . Using this approach they calculate the average in vivo elongation rate of Pol II to be 3 . 8 kb / min , with relatively small variation among the genes tested . In addition , they show that pre - mRNA splicing of U2 - and U12 - dependent introns happens rapidly , in a co - transcriptional manner , within 5 – 10 min after transcription of the downstream exon ( Fig . 1d ) . Although the U2 result is very consistent with past measurements made on shorter introns , the U12 results help resolve a controversy among researchers in the splicing field , some of whom have suggested that U12 - mediated splicing occurred in the cytoplasm 17 . Comparison of Pol II elongation rates in Drosophila , yeast and human ( derived from this study ) shows that the elongation rate is as much as three times faster in human cells .
