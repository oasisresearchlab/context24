Methods : We classiﬁed the US weekly COVID - 19 data into 0 – 4 , 5 – 11 , 12 – 17 , 18 – 64 , and 65 + age groups and applied the odds ratio ( OR ) of incidence between one age group and the 18 – 64 age group to delineate the transmissibility change . Results : The changes of incidence ORs between May , 2020 and November , 2021 were 0 . 22 – 0 . 66 ( 0 – 4 years ) , 0 . 20 – 1 . 34 ( 5 – 11 years ) , 0 . 39 – 1 . 04 ( 12 – 17 years ) , and 0 . 82 – 0 . 73 ( 65 + years ) . The changes could be explained by age - speciﬁc preexisting immunity including previous infection and vaccination , as well as volumes of breathing air . At the early pandemic , the ratio that 0 – 4 - year children exhaled one - ﬁfth of air and discharge a similar ratio of viruses was closely associated with incidence OR between two age groups . While , after a rollout of pandemic and vaccination , the much less increased preexisting immunity in children resulted in rapidly increased OR of incidence . The ARIMA model predicted the largest increase of relative transmissibility in 6 coming months in 5 – 11 - year children . Conclusions : The volume of breathing air may be a notable factor contributing to the infectivity of COVID - 19 among different age groups of patients . This factor and the varied preexisting greatly shape the transmission of COVID - 19 at different periods of pandemic among different age groups of people . Keywords : coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , host susceptibility , volume of breathed air , age - speciﬁc transmissibility , preexisting immunity INTRODUCTION As of November 2021 , the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) has caused more than 250 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) and 5 . 0 million deaths ( 1 ) . The COVID - 19 pandemic demonstrates distinctive age - speciﬁc infection rates ( 2 ) , showing signiﬁcantly lower infection rates in young children aged under 10 years at the early pandemic ( 3 ) , as proved by the report of the ﬁrst 149 , 082 US cases , consisting of only 2 , 572 ( ∼ 1 . 7 % ) Song et al . Age - Speciﬁc Transmissibility Change of COVID - 19 infants , children , and adolescents < 18 years despite children < 18 years making up 22 % of the US population ( 4 ) . This feature is contrasting with inﬂuenza , as reported that the odds ratio ( OR ) of inﬂuenza - like illness among children vs . adults was 3 . 1 ( 5 ) , although both diseases are caused by respiratory RNA viruses alike . Whether a virus can successfully invade individuals and causes symptoms depends on three determinant factors , including viral load reaching the host , environmental factors , and host susceptibility to the virus ( 6 ) . Host susceptibility and viral load often demonstrate age - speciﬁc features ( 7 ) . Previous studies have found similar distinctive age - speciﬁc infection rates of COVID - 19 in many transmission scenarios ( 8 , 9 ) , suggesting that the distinctive host susceptibility between children and adults markedly accounts for lower transmissibility among children . Host susceptibility to infectious diseases usually depends on preexisting immunity and viral load entering individuals . Preexisting immunity to COVID - 19 was determined by preceding infection and vaccination ( 10 ) , both of which were more prominent in adults than in children because adults were prioritized for vaccination and had a higher incidence of COVID - 19 in most countries . As to the entrance of SARS - CoV - 2 into the host , substantial evidence proved that airborne transmission through the respiratory route was the main mode of COVID - 19 transmission ( 11 ) . Airborne SARS - CoV - 2 mainly comes from exhaled air of patients and previous studies have proved no diﬀerence in viral load in the breathing air between children and adults ( 12 ) , hence , a higher volume of breathing air of patients results in a higher airborne viral load that greatly increases the transmissibility of COVID - 19 ( 13 ) . In human beings , the volume of breathing air is determined by breath rate and tidal volume . Tidal volume is the volume of air moving in or out of the lungs in one breathing cycle and is correlated with body weight , about 7 mL of breathing air per 1 kg body weight in one breath ( 14 ) . A 70 - kg adult breathes ∼ 500 mL of air per breath or 10 L per min when he / she breathes 20 times per min at the rest state . Generally , children have a faster rate of breath , i . e . , 30 – 40 , 25 – 30 , and 20 – 25 breaths / min for children under 1 , 1 – 3 , and 4 – 14 years , respectively . A child weighing 10 kg ( 1 year old , 30 breaths / min ) approximately has a tidal volume of 70 mL and breathes 2 . 1 L of air per min ( 15 ) . To date , the comprehensive impacts of diverse breathing air volumes and preexisting immunity on the transmission of COVID - 19 at diﬀerent pandemic stages have not been investigated . Especially , the diverse breathing air volumes among diﬀerent age people have been overlooked in previous studies . We hypothesized that at the early stages of the COVID - 19 pandemic , when the whole population have very low immunity to SARS - CoV - 2 , the diﬀerence in breathing air volume was a determinant factor that characterizes the relative transmissibility of COVID - 19 in terms of ORs of incidence between children and adults . While after a duration of pandemic and vaccination , the increased preexisting immunity would discretely aﬀect the transmission in diﬀerent age groups . In this study , we used the age - stratiﬁed incidence of the US COVID - 19 data to describe the change of relative host susceptibility and transmissibility among diﬀerent age groups . Risk factors including diﬀerent volumes of breathing air , preexisting immunity , and government responses were analyzed for host susceptibility and transmissibility during various stages of the pandemic . We also made a prediction of relative transmissibility among diﬀerent age groups by the autoregressive integrated moving average ( ARIMA ) model . METHODS Study Data The COVID - 19 weekly incidence of cases ( number of cases / 100 , 000 persons ) and full vaccination rate ( percentage ) stratiﬁed by age were obtained from the US CDC ( https : / / covid . cdc . gov / covid - data - tracker / # demographicsovertime ) . The data covered from May , 2020 to November , 2021 . OR of incidence between an age group and 18 – 64 years group was calculated . Mean body weights of 0 – 4 , 5 – 11 , and 12 – 17 years were designated as 12 , 25 , and 48 kg that were the median body weight using the WHO children’s standard weight . People of 18 – 64 and 65 + years were all adults and were designated a mean body weight of 70 kg . Their tidal volumes were calculated according to the equation of 7 mL × kg of body weight . The volume of breathing air per minute was calculated by tidal volume × breathing rate ( Table 1 ) . Ratio of volume of breathing air per minute between an age group and 18 – 64 years was calculated . Preexisting immunity in each age group was represented by the sum of infection percentage and full vaccination percentage . Association Between Volume of Breathing Air and Incidence Among Different Age Populations As airborne transmission through the respiratory route is the main mode of COVID - 19 transmission , the transmissibility of COVID - 19 is correlated with the viral load inhaled from the contaminated air . This viral load largely depends on the volume of exhaled or inhaled air by the patient . When children and adults were exposed to the same environment , such as in the household , they inhaled and exhaled age - speciﬁc viral loads because of diﬀerent volumes of breathing air . We used the breathing air volume calculated from body weight to represent the relative viral load transmitted via breathing air , which was referred to as the relative transmissibility in terms of OR . We designated the transmissibility of 70 - kg adults to be 1 . The ORs representing transmissibility and relative host susceptibility between one age group and 18 – 64 - year adults were calculated . ARIMA Models Time series analysis aims to reveal reliable and meaningful statistics and use this knowledge to predict future values of a series of data . The ARIMA model is one of the most used time series models and was applied in the analysis of COVID - 19 transmission ( 16 ) . The current study applied the automatic time series forecasting package in R to conduct ARIMA analysis ( 17 ) . The weekly ORs between an age group and 18 – 64 age group were accompanied by time information and were typical time series data . We used these data to construct an ARIMA model to predict Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 2 March 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 850206 Song et al .

The model that minimized the Akaike information criterion ( AIC ) amongst all appropriate models with diﬀerent time period was selected as the best model for prediction . RESULTS Up to November , 2021 , 49 million cases were reported by the US CDC . Based on body weight , similar exposure chances in households , schools , and workplaces , we deﬁned ﬁve age groups of 0 – 4 , 5 – 11 , 12 – 17 , 18 – 64 , and 65 + years by averaging the incidence of the component age groups . In May , 2020 , 0 – 11 - year children had the lowest risk of infection , while as the pandemic developed , the infection rate in school children ( 5 – 17 years ) gradually increased to the high infection rates in November , 2021 . The 65 + elders and 0 – 4 young children had low risk in the late pandemic ( Figure 1 ) . Compared with the 18 – 64 age group , the ORs of weekly incidence for 0 – 4 , 5 – 11 , and 12 – 17 age groups climbed from 0 . 22 , 0 . 2 , and 0 . 39 in May , 2020 to 0 . 66 , 1 . 34 , and 1 . 04 in November , 2021 , respectively ( Figure 2 ) . This drastic raise of ORs indicated the relative increasing transmissibility of COVID - 19 among the 0 – 17 years population . In contrast , the OR of the 65 + age group declined from 0 . 82 to 0 . 73 during the same period , suggesting a reduced relative susceptibility to COVID - 19 in the 65 + years . Moreover , the 12 – 17 age group had two peaks of susceptibility increase around May and August , 2021 . In 2021 , the vaccination was rolled out rapidly among the 12 – 17 , 18 – 64 , and 65 + age groups ( Figure 3 ) . As of November 2021 , the full vaccination rates were 0 , 1 , 51 . 4 , 66 . 2 , and 85 . 9 % among ﬁve age groups , respectively , indicating massively lower preexisting immunity rates among the 0 – 11 - year children than the > 12 - year population . As proposed above , when preexisting immunity has not been established at the early epidemic of an emerging respiratory virus like SARS - CoV - 2 , the airborne viral load inhaled and exhaled by patients was the key contributor to infection . Such a postulation was strongly proved by the evident relationship between OR of breathing air volume and OR of incidence at the early period of COVID - 19 pandemic ( Table 1 ) . Compared with the volume of breathing air of 18 – 64 - year adults , the ratios of breathing air volume for the 0 – 4 , 5 – 11 , 12 – 17 , and 65 + age groups were 0 . 25 , 0 . 45 , 0 . 69 , and 1 , respectively . At the early pandemic period of May , 2020 , the ORs of incidence of these age groups were 0 . 22 , 0 . 20 , 0 . 39 , and 0 . 82 , which was highly associated with the ORs of breathing air volume . For the 0 – 4 - year children , the OR of incidence was very similar to the ratio of volume of breathing air , implicating the marked contribution of the volume of breathing air to host susceptibility . However , at the late pandemic period of November , 2021 , the corresponding ORs of incidence in the 0 – 4 , 5 – 11 , 12 – 17 age groups were 0 . 66 , 1 . 34 , and 1 . 04 . The increased OR of incidence in young children ( 0 – 4 and 5 – 11 years ) suggested less contribution of breathing air volume to infection rate . Finally , to investigate the OR trend denoting the relative host susceptibility of COVID - 19 infection among diﬀerent age groups , ARIMA model of weekly OR values of each age group was employed to make a 26 - week prediction , i . e . , from November , 2021 to May , 2022 ( Figure 4 ) . The model demonstrated that the 0 – 4 and 5 – 11 age groups would increase from 0 . 63 to 0 . 78 , and from 1 . 14 to 1 . 4 , respectively , while the 12 – 17 and 65 + age groups would remain a steady level . The results suggested that 0 – 11 - year - young children would continuously experience an increased host susceptibility to COVID - 19 , an average increase by 26 % as compared with adults . DISCUSSION We used the US weekly COVID - 19 data to highlight the age - speciﬁc transmissibility change of COVID - 19 resulting from host susceptibility during the COVID - 19 pandemic . We demonstrated associations between host susceptibility and two risk factors of volume of breathing air and preexisting immunity . We conclude that at the early COVID - 19 pandemic , varied volumes of breathing air are a notable positive determinant factor of host susceptibility and transmissibility of COVID - 19 , while at the late pandemic , preexisting immunity develops to be an increasing age - speciﬁc impact . The ARIMA model predicts a probable long - term increase of transmissibility in 0 – 11 - year children . By now , the age - speciﬁc transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 requires further study . Previous research reported that children were less susceptible to COVID - 19 infection than adults . Data from the ﬁrst few months of the pandemic revealed that individuals aged under 20 years had approximately half of the infection rate of adults aged 20 years and older ( 18 ) . However , these conclusions failed to describe the distinctive change of susceptibility among diﬀerent age groups at diﬀerent stages of the pandemic . This phenomenon also seemed puzzling when we considered that SARS - CoV - 2 was RNA virus and had a similar respiratory transmission mode like inﬂuenza virus to Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 3 March 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 850206 Song et al .

We undertook to ﬁgure out this discrepancy by investigating pivotal factors aﬀecting host susceptibility . Besides the preexisting immunity , we included the volume of breathing air that varied dramatically between children and adults and determined the breathed viral load . We applied OR of the incidence of COVID - 19 between one age group and 18 – 64 age group to delineate the relative transmissibility among diﬀerent age groups , as these OR values were more telling in demonstrating the changing incidence among various groups . These ORs changed diﬀerentially from the early to late COVID - 19 pandemic , showing age - speciﬁc trajectories of host susceptibility change between age groups . As compared to 18 – 64 age group , the ORs of weekly incidence in 0 – 4 , 5 – 11 , and 12 – 17 age groups increased by 200 , 570 , and 266 % from May , 2020 to November , 2021 , respectively , while the OR for the 65 + age group Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 4 March 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 850206 Song et al .

FIGURE 4 | ARIMA model of weekly odds ratio of the US COVID - 19 incidence between one age group and 64 + age group . declined by 11 % ( Figure 1 ) . Notably , the 65 + age group had a rapid decrease in the OR around January – April , 2021 , while 5 – 17 children had a rapid increase . Although mutated SARS - CoV - 2 might partly account for the changes of transmissibility , the continuous age - speciﬁc OR changes implied persistently changing host susceptibility among diﬀerent age groups . As noted already , host susceptibility is chieﬂy aﬀected by viruses successfully entering individuals and preexisting immunity . The magnitude of these two factors varied substantially among diﬀerent age groups in a developing pandemic by an emerging pathogen . Our ﬁndings denoted that at the early stages of the COVID - 19 pandemic when preexisting immunity was not established , the volume of breathing air played Frontiers in Public Health | www . frontiersin . org 5 March 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 850206 Song et al . Age - Speciﬁc Transmissibility Change of COVID - 19 a pivotal role in determining the viral load exhaling from and inhaling into a patient and thus the transmissibility , as proved by the highly similar ORs between the volume of breathing air and the incidence among diﬀerent age groups in May , 2020 ( Table 1 , Figure 2 ) . The association between transmissibility and volume of breathing air could be easily inferred because the titration of the viruses in the air exhaled by adults and children was similar , while adults breathed more air ( 19 ) . The ratio that a 70 - kg adult breathes ﬁve times of air per minute as a 0 – 4 - year child was almost the same as the OR of incidence between these two age groups . At the late stages of the pandemic , adults established a higher level of preexisting immunity due to higher infection rates and prioritized vaccination ( Figure 3 ) . To what extent preexisting immunity can inﬂuence the transmissibility of COVID - 19 among diﬀerent age people for a long time remains a challenging question . We can get a clue from the characteristics of inﬂuenza transmission that rages on human beings for more than 100 years . Inﬂuenza infects people in many similar aspects such as transmission mode , mutation , as well as viral biological features . After years of ﬁghting against inﬂuenza virus , adults are much less susceptible compared to children , owing to a higher - level preexisting immunity gradually established with age , as illustrated by a cross - sectional study in England in 2008 investigating baseline antibody titration to inﬂuenza A H1N1 infection . The England study showed age - dependent positive rates of baseline antibody as follows : 4 . 9 % ( 0 – 4 years ) , 12 . 3 % ( 5 – 14 years ) , 29 . 1 % ( 15 – 24 years ) , 44 . 6 % ( 50 – 64 years ) , and 83 . 7 % ( > 80 years ) ( 20 ) , revealing great diﬀerence in baseline antibody levels among diﬀerent age groups . This excellently explained the order of attack rate for 2009 pandemic inﬂuenza A ( H1N1 ) that was 5 – 18 , 0 – 4 , 19 – 64 , and 65 + years ( 21 ) . Considering the more than 1 - year pandemic of COVID - 19 , preexisting immunity diﬀered greatly between 18 – 64 - year adults and 0 – 11 - year children because of the age - speciﬁc vaccination policy and infection levels ( Figure 3 ) . We can view 0 – 4 - year children as a baseline of preexisting immunity before a respiratory pandemic like SARS - CoV - 2 and inﬂuenza virus because they do not experience enough exposure . When and how people have a proﬁle of preexisting inﬂuenza - like immunity to COVID - 19 is a vital issue to investigate and monitor . The ORs of diﬀerent age groups in our study in November , 2021 showed an order trend partly like inﬂuenza , i . e . , 5 – 11 , 12 – 17 , 18 – 64 , 65 + , and 0 – 4 age groups ( Figures 1 , 2 ) . We found that the 65 + age group had preexisting immunity level of 94 . 4 % , which was close to 2009 H1N1 ( 83 . 7 % ) in the preceding report . The current study suggests that preexisting immunity similar to inﬂuenza is developing in population in the COVID - 19 pandemic . Finally , ARIMA analysis made an age - speciﬁc prediction of the relative susceptibility . In the following 6 months , a steady increase in OR was predicted for the 0 – 4 and 5 – 11 age groups , whereas the 17 – 19 and 65 + age groups were predicted to remain an unchanged OR trend ( Figure 4 ) . We believe a longer time is required to reach transmission features like inﬂuenza that most age groups have a high level of preexisting immunity . The present study had strengths and weak . The strength is that the American COVID - 19 data have accurate information about age - speciﬁc incidence for the whole period . We used OR of incidence between age groups to vividly illustrate the relative transmissibility among diﬀerent age groups . The weak aspect is that many confounding factors other than the three risk factors discussed above might aﬀect the COVID - 19 transmission . We managed to compensate other underlying factors using OR of incidence . To summarize , our study highlights that varied preexisting immunity at the early and late stages of the COVID - 19 pandemic wields distinctive impacts on people of diﬀerent ages . The volume of breathing air may be a notable factor contributing to the infectivity of COVID - 19 among diﬀerent age groups of patients . Intensiﬁed monitor about the age - speciﬁc impacts of preexisting immunity on the transmissibility of the pandemic is imperative .
