Weinstock , MD , PhD ; Ashlynne R . Harris ; Michael R . Hinckley , MD ; Steven R . Feldman , MD ; Alan B . Fleischer , MD ; Brett M . Coldiron , MD Objectives : To estimate the incidence of nonmela - noma skin cancer ( NMSC ) in the US population in 2006 and secondarily to indicate trends in numbers of proce - dures for skin cancer treatment . Design : A descriptive analysis of population - based claims and US Census Bureau data combined with a population - based cross - sectional survey using multiple US govern - ment data sets , including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Fee - for - Service Physicians Claims da - tabases , to calculate totals of skin cancer procedures per - formed for Medicare beneficiaries in 1992 and from 1996 to 2006 and related parameters . The National Ambula - tory Medical Care Service database was used to estimate NMSC - related office visits . We combined these to esti - mate totals of new skin cancer diagnoses and affected in - dividuals in the overall US population . Results : The total number of procedures for skin can - cer in the Medicare fee - for - service population increased by 76 . 9 % from 1 158 298 in 1992 to 2 048 517 in 2006 . The age - adjusted procedure rate per year per 100 000 ben - eficiaries increased from 3514 in 1992 to 6075 in 2006 . From 2002 to 2006 ( the years for which the databases allow procedure linkage to patient demographics and di - agnoses ) , the number of procedures for NMSC in the Medicare population increased by 16 . 0 % . In this pe - riod , the number of procedures per affected patient in - creased by 1 . 5 % , and the number of persons with at least 1 procedure increased by 14 . 3 % . We estimate the total number of NMSCs in the US population in 2006 at 3 507 693 and the total number of persons in the United States treated for NMSC at 2 152 500 . Conclusions : The number of skin cancers in Medicare beneficiaries increased dramatically over the years 1992 to 2006 , due mainly to an increase in the number of af - fected individuals . Using nationally representative data - bases , we provide evidence of much higher overall to - tals of skin cancer diagnoses and patients in the US population than previous estimates . These data give the most complete evaluation to date of the underrecog - nized epidemic of skin cancer in the United States . Arch Dermatol . 2010 ; 146 ( 3 ) : 283 - 287 N ONMELANOMA SKIN CAN - cer ( NMSC ) is the most common malignancy in the United States , with substantial associated morbidity and cost , as well as relatively smaller but significant mortality . The most recent , peer - reviewed , published , na - tional incidence estimate is from 1994 . This study estimated 900 000 to 1 200 000 NMSCs in that year , approximately equal - ing all other cases of human malignan - cies combined . 1 , 2 However , the exact in - cidence of NMSC is unknown because the condition is not typically reported to can - cer registries . Several studies have documented trends in skin cancer incidence in the US popu - lation . 3 - 10 A study of 3 counties in New Mexico described increases in age - adjusted NMSC rates from 71 . 8 per 100 000 persons in 1972 to 150 . 4 per 100 000 persons in 1999 , a 109 % in - crease . 6 Evaluation of the Southeastern Ari - zona Skin Cancer Registry demonstrated a leveling off of NMSC incidence with a decrease in squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) rates . 10 Another study of age - adjusted rates for NMSC in New Hamp - shire showed a 235 % increase in females and a 350 % increase in males for SCC , and an 80 % increases in basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) incidence from 1979 to 1993 . 4 In - creases in skin cancer incidence have also been documented in multiple areas out - side the United States . 11 - 15 Understanding skin cancer incidence and treatment is important for planning prevention strategies and allocating re - sourcesfortreatment .

However , the large number of cases made NMSC the fifth most costly cancer to treat overall in the Medicare population , with NMSC accounting for over 4 . 5 % of all Medicare cancer costs and over 0 . 7 % of the Medicare budget for physician services . 16 , 17 Further - more , these costs increased 41 % between 1992 and 1995 . 16 The primary purpose of this study is to estimate 2006 NMSC incidence in the United States using national popu - lation - based data sources . METHODS DATA SOURCES Our analyses were based primarily on 2 distinct Medicare da - tabases and on national survey data . The Medicare physician / supplier procedure summary master file ( hereinafter , Total Claims Data Set ) was analyzed for the years 1992 and 1996 to 2006 ( available years ) . 18 For our primary approach to the es - timation of NMSC , the 2006 Total Claims Data Set was used to provide total numbers of approved fee - for - service Medicare claims categorized by Current Procedural Terminology ( CPT ) procedure code number . 19 However , the Total Claims Data Set does not contain information relating to patient age or Inter - national Classification of Diseases , Ninth Revision , Clinical Modi - fication ( ICD - 9 - CM ) diagnosis , associated with each proce - dure code . 20 The Medicare Limited Data Set Standard Analytic File5 % SamplePhysicianSupplierData ( hereinafter , 5 % Sample Data Set ) was available for 2002 to 2006 . 21 This nationally sampled Medicare database contains information on claims filed for approved procedures with their associated ICD - 9 - CM di - agnosis codes , patient age stratification , and counts of unique persons receiving the services . Hence , the 5 % Sample Data Set allowed estimation of the proportion of procedures for skin can - cer that were for NMSC , the proportion of procedures that were conducted on enrollees older than 65 years , and the mean num - ber of procedures per enrollee with any procedures . The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey ( NAMCS ) is a cross - sectional survey system of ambulatory - based physi - cians wherein participating physicians complete a question - naire for patient visits during a random 1 - week period of the year . 22 These visit observations are then used to provide a na - tional estimate of physician visits and limited characteristics of these visits for that year . The NAMCS allowed estimation of the proportion of visits for NMSC in the United States that were conducted in the population older than 65 years . ESTIMATION OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF NMSCs IN 2006 For this study , we define NMSC incidence in 2 ways : as newly diagnosed NMSCs and as persons with a newly diagnosed NMSC , with the latter as our primary definition , although we present both . The number of skin cancers in the fee - for - service Medicare population was estimated in this study as the total of approved skin cancer treatment procedures ( malig - nant destructions , malignant excisions , and Mohs micro - graphic surgical procedures ) for that year from the Total Claims Data Set . Thus , the crude number of skin cancers for a given year was estimated by adding the numbers of approved claims for skin cancer procedure code series ( 11600 - 11606 , 11620 - 11626 , and 11640 - 11646 for malignant excisions ; 17260 - 17266 , 17270 - 17276 , and 17280 - 17286 for malignant destructions , 17304 for Mohs surgical procedures ) . The total specific to NMSC was determined by multiplying the esti - mated crude number of skin cancers by the proportion of skin cancer procedure code claims associated with the ICD - 9 - CM diagnoses for invasive nonmelanoma cutaneous malignancy ( 173 . 0 - 173 . 9 ) and in situ malignancy ( 232 . 0 - 232 . 9 ) from the 5 % Sample Data Set . The number of procedures per affected individual and the number of unique persons that underwent at least 1 procedure were also derived from the 5 % Sample Data Set . Based on our ICD - 9 - CM code definition of NMSC , almost all of the skin cancers measured in this study were keratino - cyte carcinomas ( ie , BCC , invasive SCC , or SCC in situ ) . However , other varieties of skin cancer are also included in our totals , such as Merkel cell carcinoma , adnexal carcinomas , and malignant melanoma in situ . These cancers are relatively uncommon compared with BCC and SCC , and because of the imprecise nature of ICD - 9 - CM coding , we cannot separate procedures for these diagnoses . Excluded from our count were some forms of NMSC , such as cutaneous lymphoma and genital skin cancers that have separate ICD - 9 - CM codes . Therefore , although some malignant melanomas in situ are included in our estimates , and some NMSCs are excluded , the overall number of keratinocyte carcinomas is so much larger that these inclusions and exclusions should have a small effect on our overall estimate . For example , analysis of the Surveil - lance , Epidemiology , and End Results ( SEER ) database for 2006 estimates 49710 new US cases of malignant melanoma in situ ( 1 . 4 % of our total NMSC estimate ) . 23 For this article , we will use the common but admittedly imprecise term NMSC . The number of NMSCs in the Medicare population 65 years or older was established from the Total Claims Data Set and the 5 % Sample Data Set . The proportion of the entire US popu - lation ( (cid:2) 65 years ) covered under Medicare was derived from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2007 Trustee’s report and US census data , allowing estimation of the number of NMSCs in the entire population segment that was 65 years or older . 24 , 25 The proportion of total office visits for NMSC ICD - 9 - CM codes ( 173 . 0 - 173 . 9 and 232 . 0 - 232 . 9 ) that were for the segment of the population that was 65 years or older in 2006 was obtained from the NAMCS . The number of NMSCs in the US population ( (cid:2) 65 years old ) was then divided by the pro - portion of office visits for NMSC in that group , allowing esti - mation of the total number of skin procedures for NMSC in the United States . The total number of persons in the United States diagnosed as having NMSC in that year was calculated fromtheskincancerproceduretotalsandthenumberofNMSCsperaffectedMedicarepatient . More detailed representation of the calculation described in this section is available at the Skin Cancer Center Web site . 26 AGE ADJUSTMENT OF NMSC RATES The age - adjusted NMSC Medicare Part B Fee - for - Service pro - cedure rate was calculated , standardized to the year 2006 . The Total Claims Data Set for 1992 and 1996 to 2006 does not con - tain age - stratified data . Therefore , crude skin cancer proce - durerateswerederivedusingthisdatabase , butage - specificrates could not be determined . The 5 % Sample Data Set is age strati - fied in 5 - year intervals and allowed calculation of age - adjusted procedure rates . The methods and calculations deriv - ing age - adjusted procedure rates are available at the Skin Cancer Center Web site . 27 ( REPRINTED ) ARCH DERMATOL / VOL 146 ( NO . 3 ) , MAR 2010 WWW .

RESULTS The total number of fee - for - service Medicare skin can - cer procedures increased over the 15 years of the study ( 1992 , 1996 - 2006 ) from 1 158 298 to 2 048 517 , with an overall increase of 77 . 0 % ( Table 1 ) . The age - adjusted rate of skin cancer procedures increased from 3514 per 100 000 beneficiaries in 1992 to 6075 in 2006 ( Table 1 ) . Using the diagnosis - specific 5 % Sample Data Set , the over - all NMSC - specific procedure rate increased by 16 . 0 % from 2002 to 2006 , whereas the average number of proce - dures per beneficiary increased by 1 . 5 % from 1 . 61 to 1 . 63 ( Table 2 ) . Extending this analysis , the number of per - sons with at least 1 procedure for NMSC increased by 14 . 3 % from 2002 to 2006 . Using the Total Claims Data Set and 5 % Sample Data Set , the following calculations were performed . In 2006 , 93 . 7 % or 1 919 460 of the approved procedures were specific for NMSC . The 2006 total NMSC procedures for fee - for - service Medicare patients 65 years or older , as a proportion of such procedures for fee - for - service Medicare patients at all ages , were 83 . 5 % ( or 1 604 477 procedures ) . The percentage of the US population 65 years or older enrolled in fee - for - service Medicare was 73 . 8 % . Thus , the number of procedures for NMSC in 2006 in the United States in persons 65 years or older can be estimated at 2 174 383 . The NAMCS estimates of office visits for NMSC diagnoses in the US population in 2006 are 4 003 887 , of which 2 482 801 ( 62 . 0 % ) were ascribed to patients 65 years or older . Combining the Total Claims Data Set , 5 % Sample Data Set , and NAMCS , we estimate the total number of NMSCs treated in the United States in 2006 at 3 507 693 . From the 5 % Sample Data Set , the ratio of skin cancers treated per affected patient in 2006 is 1 . 63 . If this ratio is extended to the US population , then the number of persons in the United States who were treated for NMSC in 2006 can be estimated at 2 152 500 . COMMENT Nonmelanoma skin cancer is the most common malig - nancy in the United States and is not reported in most registries ; hence , the exact incidence is unknown . Based on the limited studies available , skin cancer rates seem to be climbing rapidly in the US population . The data pre - sented herein from national databases indicate that the incidence of skin cancer in the United States has sub - stantially increased from 1992 through 2006 and is now about double the last published estimate from 1994 . 1 In evaluating increases in the US incidence of NMSC since 1994 , we considered the relatively direct estimate described in the “Methods” section , and the alternative of estimating change in incidence over the 12 - year pe - riod and applying that proportion increase to the pub - lished 1994 data . We elected the former because the pub - lished 1994 incidence was itself a projection from a variety of sources and subject to considerable error . Estimation of trends from published data was limited by the very small number of published reports . Estimation by regression modeling of NAMCS data was ultimately rejected be - cause the small sampling frame and year - to - year varia - tion in visit frequency limited the reliability of our con - clusions . This study’s strengths are that it is current and based on Medicare and NAMCS nationally representative data sets . In particular , the Medicare data incorporate a huge sample size of all covered individuals and provide strong estimative power . There are some important limitations in this study’s estimates of NMSC incidence . This study assumes that 1 NMSC treatment procedure equals 1 incident NMSC . Given that a physician should not bill for a skin cancer procedure without first obtaining a pathologic diagno - sis of skin cancer , the number of skin cancer procedures is a reasonable proxy for the number of skin cancers . On the one hand , retreatment of a skin cancer owing to posi - tive histologic margins or recurrence would result in over - estimation in this model . On the other hand , biopsies that remove an entire lesion would not be captured by the pro - cedure codes we used , which would result in underes - timation . Reimbursement denial of a skin cancer claim by Medicare or treatment of a cancer by a nonsurgical modality ( such as radiation or topical chemotherapy ) would also result in underestimation . Another limita - tion of this study is that in calculating the total number Table 1 .

The calculations as - sume that the portion of the US population that is older than 65 years and not covered under Medicare fee - for - service has the same rate of skin cancer as the portion that is covered under Medicare ; that the ratio of office visits for a diagnosis of NMSC to the number of proce - dures for NMSC as defined by the NAMCS is approxi - mately the same in those 65 years or older or younger than 65 years ; and that the rate of NMSCs per affected individual is the same in the US population as a whole as for the Medicare fee - for - service population . We found little similar literature published in the past 15years . Themostrecentpeer - reviewedestimateofNMSC incidence was from 1994 . 1 That study was a projection to 1994 from population - based estimates of NMSC from the 1970s , based on trends from studies of distinct regions of North America . The estimate of 900000 to 1 . 2 million new cases of NMSC in the United States in 1994 has been car - ried forward to the present day and is cited by the Ameri - can Cancer Society and National Cancer Institute , de - spitethepresumedincreasesinincidencesincethattime . 2 , 28 Although the present report has substantial limitations , it provides a much stronger NMSC estimate than has pre - viously been published . Nevertheless , this effort under - scores the need for a system of sentinel registries for NMSC to allow for better monitoring of our efforts to combat the most common cancer in the United States . Having accurate estimates of NMSC incidence is im - portant in establishing the public health burden of this condition . However , other components beyond total num - bers must be considered . Mortality from NMSC is low but not zero . Morbidity and decreased quality of life are magnified and take on increased importance in com - mon conditions that underscore the importance of bet - ter defining and decreasing morbidity due to NMSC . Last , the dollar cost of NMSC treatment is also still poorly de - fined . 29 However , further study on the cost of skin can - cer treatment should allow better estimation of the costs to the health care system . 30 There is an epidemic of NMSC in the United States , as illustrated by comparison with the previously pub - lished estimates and the 4 . 2 % yearly average increase in cases in the Medicare population from 1992 to 2006 . To date , educational programs emphasizing sun protection have mainly been disappointing in slowing skin cancer rates . 31 In the face of ongoing increases in skin cancer incidence , continued national research and programs on treatment , education , and prevention are critical .
