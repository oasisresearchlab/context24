NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : x | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms11964 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 1 F luorescent probes have emerged as one of the widely - used tools for investigating biological systems , thanks to its sensitivity and technical simplicity . Labelling a biomolecule , particularly protein , with a functional small probe in living cell is a popular approach to obtain greater knowledge of its biological roles and functions . However , labelling a speciﬁc intracellular biomolecule is a challenging task because cells are complex , highly organized and composed of various biological events . As a result , most labelling probes reported thus far leave ﬂuorescence background due to nonspeciﬁc interactions with other cellular components 1 – 5 . In addition , probes delivery into live cells can also be demanding as some probes are not able to cross plasma membranes in native condition , thereby limiting their utility for intracellular labelling . Despite their intricacies , physicochemical properties of probes can be deﬁned numerically through their structural information , so - called descriptors . Descriptors have long been exploited in computational quantitative structure activity relationship study , for instance , to predict aqueous solubility and permeability of drugs 6 , 7 , binding afﬁnities of antitumor drugs 8 , 9 and also cellular uptake and localization of ﬂuorescent probes 10 , 11 . Rational design of cell permeable background - free ‘tame’ probes is tricky and generally involves a long process of trial - and - errors . Here we utilize probes’ descriptors for statistics - based quantitative structure activity relationship study to develop a model that can serve as a guideline to design such ideal ‘tame’ probes by predicting probes’ cellular uptake and retention through their structural parameters . The model identiﬁes three features : SlogP ( lipophilicity ) , logS ( water solubility ) and Q _ VSA _ FNEG ( negatively charged van der Waals surface area ) , as key factors inﬂuencing cell permeability and nonspeciﬁc intracellular retention of small ﬂuorescent probes . This new model is then applied to design cyclooctyne - and azide - contain - ing BODIPY ‘tame’ probes that can be utilized for labelling various intracellular organelles and engineered proteins via copper - free strain - promoted alkyne - azide cycloaddition ( SPAAC ) . Results Cellular retention and efﬂux characteristics of the probes . To expedite an efﬁcient strategy for ‘tame’ probe development , we set up a system to predict cellular properties of ﬂuorescent probes via phenotypic high - throughput screening ( HTS ) , cheminformatics and statistical analysis ( Fig . 1a ) . As the ﬁrst step , we conducted phenotypic HTS to investigate cell permeability and nonspeciﬁc binding properties of the probes in a training set . We tested about 2 , 085 probes consisted of a wide range photophysical properties from numerous ﬂuorophore cores such as BODIPY 12 – 15 , xanthone 16 , 17 , rosamine 18 , cyanine 19 , 20 and ACEMAN 21 . Their cellular inﬂux and efﬂux proﬁles were examined in two types of mammalian cells , U - 2 OS and CHO . These cell lines were chosen due to their ﬂexibility in genetic manipulation , adaptability to various culture conditions and versatility in wide biomedical research such as gene expression , toxicity screening , recombinant protein and live cell imaging . Each of the probes was added into live cells and cell image was taken after 30 min by ImageXpress Micro cellular imaging system ( Molecular Device ) . The cells were then washed with fresh growth media , and after another 10 min , a second image was taken to check the completeness of probe washing out of the cell . The ﬁrst and second imaging facilitated inﬂux ( before washing , BW ) and efﬂux ( after washing , AW ) measurements , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Three major phenotypic groups were observed : ( i ) N - group , non - stain group where probes are unable to pass through the cell membrane , ( ii ) L - group , low nonspeciﬁc binding group where probes enter the cell and leave after washing , and ( iii ) H - group , high nonspeciﬁc binding group where probes pass through cell membrane and retain inside after washing ( Fig . 1b ) . L - group signiﬁes the desired feature of the properly tamed probes as the inﬂux and efﬂux occur rapidly with minimal background . We observed that probes in L - group came from only the BODIPY family . Probes from the rosamine and cyanine family strongly bound to mitochondria , hence mainly in H - group , whereas most xanthone and ACEMAN probes were not able to pass through cellular membrane . Therefore , we focus only on BODIPY family ( 920 probes ) as a model system for further analysis ( Fig . 1c ) . BODIPY can be an ideal ﬂuorophore as it has an electrically neutral core and superior optical properties in terms of high quantum yield , tunable ﬂuorescence characteristics , high photo - stability and narrow emission bandwidth 22 . Retaining ratio for automated cellular phenotypic grouping . To measure the inﬂux and efﬂux of the probes , an automated quantitative intensity - based image analysis was then performed by Multi - Wavelength Cell Scoring analysis using MetaXpress High Content Image software . Retaining ratio ( RR , per cent ratio of the average intensity of AW image over BW image ) was computed to classify probes into the three phenotypic groups . For each cell in the image , the nuclei and cell region were segmented to provide approximate cellular boundaries . Fluorescence inten - sity was then quantiﬁed on a cell - by - cell basis by the following steps : ( i ) selecting the image of interest , ( 2 ) specifying the width of the stained cell area , ( 3 ) adjusting the intensity above local background for detection speciﬁcity , and ( 4 ) calculating ﬂuores - cence intensity with speciﬁed reporting parameters . Average ﬂuorescence intensity for each BW and AW images was calcu - lated for each probes and cell lines , and was then used as input in RR calculation ( Supplementary Figs 2 and 3 ) . RR heat map showed that about 88 % of the probes behaved similarly in both U - 2 OS and CHO , implying that these two cell lines are sufﬁcient to serve as a proxy for phenotypic screening ( Fig . 2a , Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . From this 88 % population , a majority of them ( 81 % ) were in H - group , 16 % of the probes were observed to be cell - impermeable , and 3 % were ‘tame’ probes ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Molecular descriptors can predict ‘tame’ probes’ properties . Next , we investigated the structural properties of the training set . Active three - dimensional ( 3D ) conformation of the libraries was set through energy minimization by Hamiltonian AM1 method using Molecular Operating Environment ( MOE ) software . A total of 327 molecular descriptors for each probe were then generated ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Although hundreds of descriptors were generated , not all are relevant to the study ; therefore , we cleaned up the data by removing redundant descriptors . Independency between descriptors was evaluated by checking their degree of noncorrelation using SPSS v . 13 . 0 . 1 software package ( SPSS , Inc . , Chicago , IL ) . A number of redundant descriptors were then exempted , such as : highly correlated descriptors ( for example , Q _ VSA _ FHYD and Q _ VSA _ FPOL , these descriptors have a perfect negative correlation as shown by the independency test , hence one of them can be exempted to eliminate redundancy ) , duplicated descriptors ( for example , PC þ and RPC þ ; PC (cid:2) and RPC (cid:2) ) , insigniﬁcant descriptors ( for example , rsynth , which describe the easiness of the synthesis process ) and uninterpretable descriptors ( for example , BCUT _ PEOE _ 0 , BCUT _ PEOE _ 1 , BCUT _ PEOE _ 2 , BCUT _ PEOE _ 3 ) . This elimination resulted in 39 descriptors for further investigation ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . To identify the important descriptors responsible for probe phenotypic grouping , we carried out signiﬁcance test - based ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms11964 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : x | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms11964 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications feature selection ( STFS ) . In STFS , the statistical signiﬁcant differences of descriptors among the three phenotypic groups were calculated to evaluate the pattern recognition ability of individual descriptors . We ﬁrstly carried out a normality test to check if our data set follows a normal distribution so as to apply proper statistical methods . Formal statistical Shapiro – Wilk test was used to check data normality . Conceptually , Shapiro – Wilk test involves an arrangement of the sample values and measurement against expected means and / or variances . The measure of central tendency is important : if data distribution is normal , then both mean and median can be measured to be presented ; otherwise the median should be more appropriate . Results in Supplementary Table 3 show that nonparametric type STFS analysis was suitable for our database . 23 – 25 Next , the nonparametric Kruskal – Wallis test followed by Eta - squared test was conducted to statistically evaluate whether there is a signiﬁcant difference between descriptors’ median in the three phenotypic groups ( descriptors were considered to have a N B - N + F R 4 R 3 R 2 R 1 R 8 R 7 R 6 R 5 N - group L - group H - group Descriptor # 1 Descriptor # 2 Descriptor # 3 Descriptor # 4 Descriptor # 5 Descriptor # 6 . . .

Kruskal – Wallis signiﬁcance level was estimated on the capability of individual descriptor to form a distinct separable pattern , while Eta - squared test was used to measure the effectiveness of the descriptors intervention relative to phenotypic grouping . Our analysis suggests that lipophilicity , water solubility , surface area properties and size 26 of the probes signiﬁcantly contributed to their cellular permeability and nonspeciﬁc intracellular retention ( Supplementary Fig . 6 , Supplementary Table 4 ) . To make an interpretable and uncomplicated model , descriptors with large effect in probes’ phenotypic grouping ( Z 2 Z 0 . 1 ) were selected and analysed by using principal component analysis method to further portray the patterns and highlight the relations of those selected descriptors . The ﬁrst three principal components account for 98 . 0 % of the data set variance ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . Examination of the component loadings shows that descriptors are arranged into three clusters : lipophilicity ( SlogP , logPo / w ) , water solubility ( logS ) , and charged - surface area properties ( Q _ VSA _ NEG and Q _ VSA _ FNEG ) , indicating that these three cluster properties are the major determinant for cellular behaviour of the probes ( Supplementary Figs 7 and 8 ) . Interestingly , principal component analysis ( PCA ) loading plot indicated that three descriptors ( Q _ VSA _ FNEG ( w 2 ( 2 ) ¼ 88 . 823 , P ¼ 0 . 000 , Z 2 ¼ 0 . 110 ) , logS ( w 2 ( 2 ) ¼ 110 . 411 , P ¼ 0 . 000 , Z 2 ¼ 0 . 137 ) , and SlogP ( w 2 ( 2 ) ¼ 102 . 268 , P ¼ 0 . 000 , Z 2 ¼ 0 . 1272 ) ) are sufﬁcient to summarize the data with minimal loss of information ( Fig . 2b ) . Our results thus suggest that criteria for the ideal probes are adequately lipophilic ( SlogP ¼ 1 to 4 ) , moderately negatively charged on its surface ( Q _ VSA _ FNEG ¼ 0 . 15 to 0 . 35 ) and highly soluble in water ( logS ¼ (cid:2) 2 to (cid:2) 6 ; Fig . 2c , Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Validation set for the interpretable model . The ultimate goal of a modelling exercise is not only to ﬁt a model into a data set , but importantly to also provide a clear guide to design and synthesize molecules with desired properties . As a proof of concept , we applied the model to an extended set of our in - house BODIPY library ( EP library ) consists of 107 various structures ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . On the basis of their descriptors value , the model predicted that nine of the EP probes are in L - group ( ‘tame’ probes ) . Cell experiment showed that eight of the nine probes are indeed in L - group , which is corresponding to a prediction accuracy rate of 89 % ( Supplementary Table 6 ) . It is interesting to note that BODIPY is known to be sticky / hydrophobic and usually leaves high background in the cells . To tame BODIPY into background - free probe while keeping its cellular permeability , we synthesized boronic acid - bearing – 14 . 0 – 12 . 0 – 10 . 0 – 8 . 0 – 6 . 0 – 4 . 0 – 2 . 0 12 . 010 . 08 . 06 . 0 S l og P 4 . 02 . 00 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 Q _ V S A _ F N E G 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 l og S 100 50 CH O B D M C A B DNC A N YB D T A M B D M C A B DNC A N YB D T A M U - 2 O S a b * 12 . 00 10 . 00 8 . 00 6 . 00 4 . 00 2 . 00 S l og P N - g r oup L - g r oup H - g r oup P heno t y pe c * * * * * 0 . 80 0 . 60 0 . 40 0 . 20 Q _ VSA _ F N E G N - g r oup L - g r oup H - g r oup P heno t y pe * * * * * – 2 . 00 – 4 . 00 – 6 . 00 – 8 . 00 – 10 . 00 – 12 . 00 – 14 . 00 l og S N - g r oup L - g r oup H - g r oup P heno t y pe * * Figure 2 | Predictive model .

Based on their SlogP , Q _ VSA _ FNEG and logS values , BOR - 1H and BOR - 2H were predicted to be in H - group while BOR - 1 and BOR - 2 were in L - group ( Supplementary Table 7 , Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . We found that the predicted phenotypic groups for these probes are in agreement with the observed cell experimental results , hence validating our predictive model for background - free probes ( Supplementary Table 8 , Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . ‘Tame’ probes for intracellular labelling in living cells . To further demonstrate the model and its applications , we synthe - sized BCN alcohol - containing BODIPY probes , CO - 1 and CO - 1H , to ﬁt the L - group and H - group , respectively , by varying substituents at different positions of the BODIPY core for SPAAC - based labelling . Their absorbance and emission are similar to GFP , thus enabling their visualization on most standard ﬂuorescence microscope ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . Fascinatingly , cellular retention and efﬂux study showed the phenotypic grouping of CO - 1 and CO - 1H as predicted ( Supplementary Fig . 14 , Supplementary Table 9 ) . Next , we investigated intracellular imaging in live cells using CO - 1 . We synthesized various azide - bearing reporters : TPP - Az , a triphenylphosphonium analogue which accumulates in mito - chondria ; Sphingo - Az , a ceramide analogue to target golgi apparatus ; and Morph - Az , an azide derivative with morpholine moiety as a directing group for lysosome ( Fig . 3a ) . SPAAC covalent labelling reactions between CO - 1 and all azide reporters in vitro were clean and rapid . We anticipated that the cell permeable CO - 1 is capable of labelling any azide reporters effectively , regardless the reporters’ cellular localization . We added 2 m M CO - 1 to the growth media of U - 2 OS cells pre - treated with TPP - Az , Sphingo - Az or Morph - Az separately . Confocal ﬂuorescence images were then taken after probe washing . As shown in Fig . 3b , CO - 1 clearly labelled the azide - tagged intracellular organelles in live cells , and CO - 1 signal was nicely colocalized with respective organelle probe trackers . Clean ﬂuorescence background was observed due to washable property of the unreacted CO - 1 . In contrast , when CO - 1H was added to the cells pre - treated with TPP - Az , Sphingo - Az or Morph - Az , high - ﬂuorescence background from CO - 1H interfered with the observation of the intracellular organelles ( Supplementary Fig . 15 ) . We further demonstrated the utility of CO - 1 for visualization of engineered protein with an example of human histone H2B , which localizes at the nucleolus . The red ﬂuorescent protein mKate2 was fused to the C terminus of human histone H2B as a red ﬂuorescent marker . Using the in vivo unnatural amino acid ( UAA ) technology , 27 , 28 an azide - bearing UAA , p - azido - L - phenylalanine ( Azi ) , was site - speciﬁcally incorporated at site 16 of mKate2 of the fusion protein H2B - mKate2 , which was expressed in live U - 2 OS cells . The cells were labelled with CO - 1 , washed to remove unreacted CO - 1 , and then imaged with laser scanning confocal microscopy . To our delight , CO - 1 was not only able to label cytosolic organelles , but also to pass through nuclear membrane . Clear CO - 1 signal was detected in the live cell nucleolus out of low background , and was highly colocalized with mKate2 signals , suggesting speciﬁc labelling of histone H2B ( Fig . 3c , Supplementary Fig . 16 ) . Moreover , CO - 1 exhibited superior photostability under intensive radiation of strong light source in aqueous solution ( Supplementary Fig . 17 ) and was found to be nontoxic and did not interfere with cell proliferation ( Supplementary Fig . 18 ) , making CO - 1 suitable for prolonged time lapse imaging . Excited with the results , we further challenged the model and developed another ‘tame’ azide - bearing probe , AzG - 1 , to label molecules in mitochondria and the fancy tubulin protein in living cells ( Figs 4a , b ) . To target mitochondria , U - 2 OS cells were pre - treated with TPP - BCN ( an analogue of triphenylphosphonium ) before labelled with 10 m M AzG - 1 . For tubulin labelling , a cyclooctyne - containing UAA , N - e - ( cyclooct - 2 - yn - 1 - yloxy ) carbo - nyl ) L - lysine ( CoK ) was selected for incorporating into tubulin and reacting with AzG - 1 via SPAAC . 29 CHO - K1 cells were co - transfected with plasmids pCoKRS - tRNA and pTub - 26TAG to incorporate CoK into a - tubulin at position 26 . Site - speciﬁc incorporation of CoK using an orthogonal tRNA Pyl / CoKRS pair was conﬁrmed via western blot analysis ( Supplementary Figs . 19 and 20 ) . After incorporation of CoK , cells were then labelled with 10 m M AzG - 1 at 37 (cid:2) C . CHO - K1 cells transfected with plasmid pEGFP - Tubwt expressing EGFP - fused wild - type a - tubulin was used as a control . Confocal ﬂuorescence images were then taken AW of unreacted AzG - 1 . Cell images clearly show that AzG - 1 speciﬁcally labelled mitochondria ( Fig . 4c ) and was also conjugated speciﬁcally with CoK - bearing a - tubulin ( Fig . 4d , Supplementary Fig . 21 ) . Discussion The combination of cheminformatics and HTS of in - house probe library yielded a novel predictive model to guide the development of cell permeable background - free ‘tame’ probes for intracellular imaging in live cells . Our systematic analysis showed that cellular behaviour of ﬂuorescent probes can be predicted from their photophysical properties ; more importantly , we found that lipophilicity , charged van der Waals surface area and water solubility are signiﬁcant determinants for probes’ cellular permeability and nonspeciﬁc binding in living cells . These descriptors may account for not only polar noncovalent interactions between probes and phosphate group of the plasma membranes during cellular intake , but also cumulative charge interactions with macromolecules inside the cells . Our result supports previous studies that hypothesized hydrophobicity and surface charge may correlate with nonspeciﬁc binding properties of ﬂuorescent probes 10 , 30 , 31 . In addition , water solubility also plays a key factor in slow cellular efﬂux of the probes . Our observation in cellular retention and efﬂux study showed that probes were stably solubilized when added to the cells , indicating that extracellular insoluble formation of the probes is unlikely . However , after the probes were incubated in cells for 30 min , the formation of intracellular insoluble or precipitate - like form which is hardly washed out of cells was observed from some of the probes in H - group . It suggests that intracellular precipitation or aggregation due to the low water solubility may be one of the mechanisms behind the slow cellular efﬂux and high retention of probes in H - group 32 – 34 . We utilized this model strategy to synthesize probes for copper - free SPAAC in living cells 3 , 35 . Early study on SPAAC reported nonpermeant cyclooctyne probes for imaging extracellular surface glycans 36 – 38 . Following that , an attempt was also made to develop cyclooctyne probe for targeting intracellular biomolecules 4 . However , this probe still suffers from high nonspeciﬁc binding . Here we show that through structure optimization on the three interpretable descriptors ( lipophilicity , charged van der Waals surface area and water solubility ) , we are able to modulate it to meet the demands of designing smart ‘tame’ probes . In summary , our predictive model provides a powerful strategy to efﬁciently develop background - free BODIPY probes for intracellular labelling in native living cells . We successfully demonstrated the robustness of this strategy by developing NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms11964 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7 : x | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms11964 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 5 novel labelling tools , CO - 1 and AzG - 1 , which are not only highly cell permeable and washable , but also exhibit a remarkable capability of labelling various intracellular organelles and engineered proteins . The strategy should allow the exploration of dynamic processes ( for example , cellular localization , expression level and biological activities ) of newly synthe - sized intracellular biomolecules in their native cellular environment .

Materials used in the cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen . U - 2 OS and CHO cells were seeded onto 96 - well plate in growth media at 37 (cid:2) C in the presence of 5 % CO 2 and were then allowed to attach and grow to 70 – 80 % conﬂuence . Library probes were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) to make the 1mM solution , and stored in (cid:2) 20 (cid:2) C . Before HTS experiment , the growth media was aspirated and replaced by 200 m l fresh growth media containing probes in ﬁnal concentration of 1 m M and nuclei dye Hoechst 33342 .

Immediately after image acquisition , the cells were washed with fresh growth media , and transferred back to a 37 (cid:2) C cell incubator for further incubation . After 10min , cells were again imaged ( AW image ) . The ﬁrst imaging step allowed inﬂux measurement of BW image , while the second imaging step allowed out - ﬂux measurement of AW image . Images of two regions per well were acquired with DAPI , FITC , TRITC or Texas Red ﬁlter sets according to probes’ excitation and emission wavelength . Experiment was performed in duplicate . Cellular retention and efﬂux char - acteristics test for other synthesized probes were also done by using the same protocol . RR calculation . RR was computed to quantitatively estimate probes retained inside the cells AW . RR was calculated by : RR % ð Þ¼ FI AW ð Þ FI BW ð Þ (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:3) 100 ð 1 Þ FI ( AW ) is the average ﬂuorescence intensity AW and FI ( BW ) is the average ﬂuor - escence intensity BW . RR is a value ranging from 0 to 100 , where higher the value , higher the nonspeciﬁc binding of the probes . Background correction was applied to each image to compensate the uneven background intensity , thus improving image segmentation and reducing calculation bias . Probes in which BW images having FI ( BW ) r 200 were classiﬁed as N - group . Probes ( FI ( BW ) 4 200 ) with rapid efﬂux were observed to have a RR of o 5 % , and thus were classiﬁed into L - group , while those with RR 4 5 % were classiﬁed into H - group . Molecular descriptor for library training set . Chemical Computing Group ( CCG ) MOE 2011 software package was used for generating 3D structure and molecular descriptors for each probe . Hydrogens and lone - pair electrons were adjusted as required . Partial charge was set and protonation state was corrected for each structure . The active 3D conformation of the libraries was then acquired through energy minimization by Hamiltonian AM1 method .

Confocal imaging experiments were performed on an inverted Nikon A1R þ confocal laser microscope system using 562 / 672 / 405nm lasers with Plan Apo TIRF 100X DiC oil H H2 objectives ( Nikon Instruments , Inc . , Japan ) . Image processing and overlay analysis were performed using NIS Elements 3 . 10 software ( Nikon Instruments , Inc . ) . Molecular cloning for histone H2B labelling . Plasmids were cloned in DH10 b Escherichia coli strain and conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing . PfuTurbo ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) was used for QuikChange reactions and Phusion ( Finnzymes , Finland ) for gene ampliﬁcation . Primers were synthesized by ValueGene ( San Diego , CA ) , and restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs ( Ipswich , MA ) . Wild - type mKate2 was cloned into pmTagRFP - T - H2B - 6 plasmid using the Age I and Not I sites .

Azi ( purchased from Bachem ) was added 1h before transfection at a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 5mM . Plasmid pIre - Azi3 ( expressing the orthogonal amber suppressor transfer RNA ( tRNA ) and the E2AziRS speciﬁc for Azi ) was co - transfected with plasmid pmH2B - 6 - mKate2 - 16tag in a 1 : 1 molar ratio . After 24h , cells were washed three times with culture medium ( DMEM with 10 % FBS ) ( 15min each time ) . Growth media containing 10 m M CO - 1 was then added to the dishes , and cells were incubated at 37 (cid:2) C for 90min followed by 4 times washing with growth media ( 30min each time ) . Laser scanning confocal microscopy ( Zeiss LSM 700 ) was used for imaging . The same conditions and settings were used for imaging control and experimental cells . Plasmid construction for site - speciﬁc CoK incorporation . Cyclooctyne - containing UAA , N - e - ( cyclooct - 2 - yn - 1 - yloxy ) carbonyl ) L - lysine ( CoK ) was selected for copper - free labelling of proteins to avoid the use of cytotoxic metals . To this end , cyclooctynyl lysine , CoK was synthesized according to the previous report 29 . For genetic incorporation of CoK , an engineered orthogonal tRNA Pyl / CoKRS pair was constructed as reported before 29 . To express proteins installed with CoK at a designated position in mammalian cells , plasmids expressing the tRNA Pyl / CoKRS pair and target protein ( s ) were constructed in the following way . CoKRS carrying C - terminal haemaglutinin ( HA ) tag is expressed under the control of EF - 1 a promoter ( derived from pEFIRES vector , Clonetech ) and tRNA under the control of human U6 promoter and the CMV enhancer . CoKRS and tRNA expression cassettes were cloned using Kpn I / Not I , and BamH I / Asc I sites of pCDNA3 vector ( Invitrogen ) respectively , generating plasmid pCoKRS - tRNA . For live cell labelling experiments , a - tubulin was used as a model protein .
