ARTICLE Intrinsic neuronal properties represent song and error in zebra ﬁ nch vocal learning Arij Daou 1 , 2 & Daniel Margoliash 1 ✉ Neurons regulate their intrinsic physiological properties , which could in ﬂ uence network properties and contribute to behavioral plasticity . Recording from adult zebra ﬁ nch brain slices we show that within each bird basal ganglia Area X – projecting ( HVC X ) neurons share similar spike waveform morphology and timing of spike trains , with modeling indicating similar magnitudes of ﬁ ve principal ion currents . These properties vary among birds in lawful relation to acoustic similarity of the birds ’ songs , with adult sibling pairs ( same songs ) sharing similar waveforms and spiking characteristics . The properties are maintained dynamically : HVC X within juveniles learning to sing show variable properties , whereas the uniformity rapidly degrades within hours in adults singing while exposed to abnormal ( delayed ) auditory feedback . Thus , within individual birds the population of current magnitudes covary over the arc of development , while rapidly responding to changes in feedback ( in adults ) . This iden - ti ﬁ es network interactions with intrinsic properties that affect information storage and pro - cessing of learned vocalizations . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14738 - 7 OPEN 1 Department of Organismal Biology & Anatomy , University of Chicago , 1027 E . 57th St . , Chicago , IL 60637 , USA . 2 Present address : Biomedical Engineering Program , American University of Beirut , P .

The type and magnitude of ion currents that a neuron expresses contribute to the number , timing , and patterns of action potentials generated in response to a given input , hence the neuron ’ s contribution to network dynamics 5 – 7 . Plasticity of these intrinsic properties ( IP ) includes homeostatic and other forms of regulation 5 , 8 , 9 , suggesting the potential for widespread contribution to brain plasticity . Neu - ronal intrinsic properties have been manipulated in vitro and in vivo , by numerous experimental approaches but also including behavioral conditioning 10 , 11 , may involve one or more ion cur - rents 8 , 12 , and can be limited to segments of dendrites 13 , 14 , or the somatic 2 or axon hillock 15 , 16 compartments . Changes in the latter compartments should modulate currents that arise from all processes of spatiotemporal summation in the neuron ’ s den - drites . Yet , relatively few studies have explored how such potentially widespread and powerful plastic mechanisms are expressed in complex learned behaviors beyond operant con - ditioning , developmentally 17 , 18 and in populations of adult neurons . Birdsong learning is a well - established model for complex vocal learning . Song learning is regulated by auditory feedback , essen - tial for song development in juveniles 19 and song maintenance in adults 20 . Manipulating either spectral or temporal features of auditory feedback induces changes in singing behavior , and birds can make adaptive responses depending on the parameters and speci ﬁ c song syllable that receives modi ﬁ ed feedback . Under - standing the mechanisms of such rapid and precise feedback regulation is important for informing computational theories of internal models of behavior . Adult zebra ﬁ nches present an interesting model , in that they sing exceedingly precise and invariant songs especially when directing them toward females and are thought to be relatively insensitive on short time scales to feedback perturbations 21 , unlike other species such as Bengalese ﬁ nches 22 . Yet , zebra ﬁ n - ches require auditory feedback to maintain their songs 20 . What mechanistic differences give rise to these different patterns of feedback regulation in different species ? The forebrain song system includes a motor pathway that ultimately engages syringeal and respiratory muscles to produce song , and a basal ganglia pathway that is engaged in feedback - mediated song learning and maintenance . Within the forebrain nucleus HVC ( the proper name ) , the basal ganglia Area X - projecting ( HVC X ) neurons projecting to the basal ganglia component of the song system ( Fig . 1a ) show precisely timed activity during singing 23 perhaps carrying information about singing while not being required for singing 24 . In quiescent birds highly song - selective auditory responses in HVC neurons have been observed in several species of songbirds 25 , 26 but these are greatly suppressed in awake zebra ﬁ nches 27 – 29 . Further - more , in response to auditory feedback perturbation during singing HVC spiking activity does not change in zebra ﬁ nches 30 including at HVC X synapses 31 , 32 , whereas similar manipula - tions reliably change HVC activity in Bengalese ﬁ nches 33 . Per - haps this pattern of feedback insensitivity in zebra ﬁ nches facilitates production of ballistic ( feedback invariant ) singing , but if so how do the birds evaluate feedback ? Here , we report a surprising mechanism that stores information about song structure rapidly . By analyzing the raw data traces in response to somatic current injections , we show a consistent pattern of homogeneity of HVC X intrinsic properties within individual adult birds and variation among birds related to the birds ’ songs . The homogeneity is maintained by plastic mechanisms and is sensitive to auditory perturbations . Results Individual birds have uniform HVC X intrinsic properties . We made intracellular whole - cell patch visually guided current clamp recordings in a brain slice preparation ( see Methods : Slice pre - paration & Whole - cell recordings ) from a total of 370 HVC X neurons distributed across multiple experimental designs in 76 animals . We unambiguously identi ﬁ ed HVC X by their distinct physiological properties , as described previously 34 – 38 , and con - ﬁ rmed these of ﬂ ine . Physiological characterization was con ﬁ rmed in 70 % ( 259 / 370 ) of neurons ﬁ lled with Biocytin ( see Fig . 1b & Methods : Histology ) , of which 96 % ( 248 / 259 ) had axons we could visualize , all of which were clearly projecting toward Area X ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Physiological characterization of HVC X neurons was further con ﬁ rmed , without exception , in 14 adults and 1 juvenile , in recordings from 114 cells that were retrogradely labeled by tracer injections into Area X ( see Methods : Retrograde tracers ) . We characterized every cell for which we achieved stable recordings . Once the structure of our results began to emerge , we focused on recording as many HVC X neurons per animal as possible , began to record the song of each bird prior to making the slice recordings , and systematically brought all cells to − 70 mV before passing stimulating currents , to minimize variability arising from voltage - dependent changes in membrane con - ductances ( resting membrane potential at break - in was − 70 . 49 ± 2 . 3 mV ( mean ± SD here and throughout the paper ) , current to hold cells at − 70 mV : 9 . 73 ± 16 . 35 pA , min − 30 pA ; max 35 pA ; N = 370 HVC X ) . All cells received canonical depolarizing ( 100 pA , 200 ms ) and hyperpolarizing ( − 140 pA , 200 ms ) current pulses , as well as many other stimuli . HVC X emit brief intense bursts of spikes during singing 30 , and emit adapting spike trains in slice when stimulated by somatic current injection 34 , 36 . In response to injections of the canonical depolarizing currents , we observed that the spike patterns for the HVC X of a given bird all tended to have similar onsets , numbers of spikes , and timing of spikes , whereas these characteristics varied from bird to bird ( Fig . 1c ) . A plot of the ﬁ rst interspike interval ( ISI ) versus spike rate showed a pattern of within - bird homogeneity and across - birds heterogeneity for the population of HVC X ( N = 253 neurons arising from all 51 adult birds each with two or more HVC X , but excluding the second of a sibling pair or post - pharmacological and other experimental treatments ( see below ) , 4 . 96 ± 2 . 31 neurons / bird ) , and individual birds were highly signi ﬁ cantly different from the population means ( Fig . 1d ) . The hypothesis that HVC X in all birds had the same means of ﬁ rst ISI , number of spikes , and spike rate was rejected ( MANOVA : see Methods , MANOVA analysis , Wilks ’ lambda = 0 . 0001 , F = 86 , d . f . = 51 , P < 1 . 5 × 10 − 5 ) . Under a more stringent set of null hypotheses in which each pair of birds shared the same mean , 69 % ( 628 ) of the pairwise MANOVA comparisons were rejected at the 5 % level ( after using the conservative Bonferroni correction ) . In a principal components analysis of spike frequency and the ﬁ rst three ISIs , PC 1 accounted for 90 % of the variance across birds ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Regulation of the number and rate of spikes HVC X neurons emit will affect their contribution to the basal ganglia pathway . Thus , in these slice recordings , the activity that HVC X neurons transmit to their network was relatively uniform within each bird and varied far more from bird to bird . Such uniformity within individual animals was not known , and was unanticipated given the variation within individual birds in the spiking patterns of different HVC X observed during singing 30 . The spike waveforms of the HVC X also tended to conform to a common shape for a given bird , while spike shape varied from bird to bird ( see Supplementary Fig . 1 for de ﬁ nitions of all spike waveform features we characterized ) . We characterized this by examining the shapes of the ﬁ rst spikes in a burst , one spike from ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14738 - 7 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 952 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14738 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications each cell , in response to the canonical depolarizing stimulation . In three birds with the greatest numbers of HVC X recorded ( N = 10 , 9 , 8 ) , the cells from a given bird had strikingly similar waveforms , whereas each bird was associated with a different spike waveform shape ( Fig . 2a ) . For the eight birds with the largest numbers of HVC X recorded ( n ≥ 8 ) , comparing the means of the ﬁ rst spike waveforms helps to illustrate the variation across birds including variation in the mean spike amplitudes and spike thresholds ( Fig . 2b ) . Spike amplitude and spike threshold segregated neurons from different birds into visually highly distinct clusters ( Fig . 2c ) , and the clustering was highly statistically signi ﬁ cant ( see Methods : Additional statistical analysis , Fig . 2c ) . Spike threshold is thought to re ﬂ ect excitability in the soma and near the spike initiating zone 39 .

Numerous other features of IP also clustered neurons from different birds ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Features such as spike amplitude , plateau amplitude , spike threshold , and interspike interval should vary with input resistance . We found such relations in our data , for example , input resistance ( 181 ± 35 M Ω , N = 253 neurons ) was signi ﬁ cantly related to ﬁ rst spike amplitude whether we considered all neurons ( R 2 = 0 . 29 , P = 4 × 10 − 6 , t - test ) , or the average across cells of the input resistance and ﬁ rst spike amplitudes for each of the 51 birds ( R 2 = 0 . 35 , P = 0 . 012 , t - test ) . Control experiments and analyses rejected several hypotheses that the variation among birds arose from uncontrolled variation in the experimental conditions . On each of 2 days we recorded from two pairs of birds ( Red 240 / Black 111 ; Blue 145 / Orange 34 ) using the same ACSF and intracellular solutions for both birds of each pair . The HVC X spike train values ( ISI versus spike rate ) for the individual neurons showed clustering within each of the four birds but varied greatly across the birds ( Fig . 1d ) , and the spike waveforms of neurons from each bird were similar but these too varied greatly between the birds of a given pair ( Fig . 2b ; Supplemental Fig . 3 ) . This demonstrates that factors other than osmolarity , internal ( pipette ) solution or relative ion concentrations of the ACSF prepared on the day of the experiment gave rise to variation between birds in the HVC X IP . Also , there was no time - dependent variation in the IP values comparing the spike amplitudes of different cells recorded over the duration of an experiment or comparing the average spike amplitudes for each bird over the longer intervals ( days ) between experiments ( see Methods : Rundown ) . There was also no relation between series resistance and ﬁ rst spike amplitude ( N = 253 neurons , 51 birds , R 2 = 0 . 029 , P = 0 . 65 , t - test ) . Thus , we found no evidence that non - speci ﬁ c effects explained the results , motivat - ing a search for biological mechanistic and behavioral explana - tions for the variation of HVC X IP . Modeling the ionic basis of uniform intrinsic properties . The relation between neuronal dynamics and spike shape should be in ﬂ uenced by the magnitude of ion currents of the given cell . We explored the relation between HVC X dynamics and spike shape by modeling the magnitude of ion currents in a large subset of the neurons ( 290 HVC X in 63 birds , all cells modeled for any given bird ) , including experimental birds ( see below ) and a large subset of the non - manipulated control birds ( 151 neurons , 38 birds , birds chosen at random ) .

We used a single - compartment model , thus not dif - ferentiating potential contributions of dendritic or somatic ion currents to the somatic measurements that we made and mod - eled . Most parameters of the HH model were held constant at biologically realistic values , while we varied the magnitudes of the maximal conductances of ﬁ ve principal ion currents including fast sodium channels ( I Na ) , potassium channels ( I K ) , calcium - dependent potassium channels ( I SK ) , hyperpolarization - activated cyclic nucleotide - gated channels ( I h ) , and T - type calcium channels ( I Ca - T ) . Modeling consisted of manually adjusting the values of the ﬁ ve current magnitudes to achieve a good ﬁ t between the output of the HH equation ( model neuron ) and the actual neuron ’ s behavior , only considering responses to the canonical depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current injections 34 . ( The effects of the ion currents on HVC X spike waveform features has been extensively described elsewhere 34 . ) A good ﬁ t was judged based on heuristics examining the spike shape and spike train , and in many cases , excellent ﬁ ts were obtained ( Fig . 3a , left panel ) . Model ﬁ ts were tested by assessing model predictions in response to current injections not used in the ﬁ tting process .

Good predictions were observed for step currents of other magnitudes ( Fig . 3a , middle panel ) , as well as for chaotic currents which incorporated more complex dynamics than the step currents ( Fig . 3a , right panel ) . Cases of good predictions demonstrate that the spike waveform shape of the neuron was linked to its bursting properties , as described by the dynamical model . To extend this analysis we adopted a quantitative measure of goodness of ﬁ t to compare model ﬁ ts with model predictions , using eight parameters of response measured from the current pulse injections ( see Methods : Model predictions and cross - validation ) . This con ﬁ rmed that the models made good predictions , for example predictions for 150 pA injections for 45 . 7 % ( 69 / 151 ) of cells were as good or better than that for neuron 4 of Fig . 3a . The quality of predictions at 75 and 150 pA were comparable , whereas predictions at higher currents ( 175 pA ) were somewhat worse . We then tested whether the manual ﬁ tting procedure had found local minima or a global error minimum , which also evaluated whether the manual ﬁ tting procedure had potentially failed to identify different local minima representing different combina - tions of ion current magnitudes for different neurons . To this end , we conducted exhaustive parameter searches on the space of the ﬁ ve ion current magnitudes , assessing the output of the model against the actual neuron ’ s output using the same measure of goodness of ﬁ t ( see Methods : Exhaustive parameter searches & Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . This demonstrated that the manual ﬁ tting produced unbiased results and tended to ﬁ nd global minima ( Fig . 3b ) . Finally , we also conducted cross - validation analyses , demonstrating that the model of a given neuron was far better at predicting responses of that neuron than were models of neurons from other birds ( see Methods : Model predictions and cross - validation & Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Whereas other parameters of the HH equations that were held constant in these modeling studies could in principle also account for similar variation within and across birds , the excellent performance of the models focused our attention on the potential biological signi ﬁ cance of the estimated ion current magnitudes . Examining the distribution of predicted current magnitudes ( manual ﬁ tting ) for the ﬁ ve ion channels revealed that the neurons from each animal occupied a small volume in the ﬁ ve - dimensional space of ion conductance magnitudes , and that there were large differences between animals . This is anticipated from the variation of spike waveforms and spike trains described above , but here is expressed in terms of magnitudes of plausible , pharmacologically con ﬁ rmed HVC X ion currents . Scatter plots show this graphically for the two currents that varied the most in adult animals ( g Na and g SK ; Fig . 3c ) , and for the other currents ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . Scatter plots comparing data ﬁ t manually and ﬁ t by parameter searches yielded similar results ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . In our sample , model estimates of g Na varied within the species by over 19 . 2 x and g SK by over 4 . 1 x , while the average variation within each animal with 5 or more neurons was 1 . 23 x ± 0 . 48 ( g Na ) and 1 . 14 x ± 0 . 12 ( g SK ) . Similar results obtained for the other three currents ( maximum variation across all neurons / average variation within each bird : 1 . 24 x ± 0 . 15 ( g K ) , 1 . 17 x ± 0 . 34 ( g h ) , 1 . 19 x ± 0 . 69 ( g Ca - T ) ) , demonstrating each bird occupied a small space in the ﬁ ve - dimension space of conductance magnitude values . To quantify the joint variation for all ﬁ ve ion conductances for each bird , for the 8 birds with ≥ 8 HVC X , we de ﬁ ned the volume of the minimal hyperellipsoid spanning the distribution of all ﬁ ve conductance magnitudes for all neurons in each bird ( see Methods : Conductance volumes ) . On average , a bird ’ s hyperellipsoid occupied a volume of only 0 . 00037 ± 6 . 1 × 10 − 5 of the “ species ” volume , that is , the hyperellipsoid volume occupied by all 151 neurons of 38 non - manipulated birds . ( If each parameter occupies 0 . 1 of the total range and the space is isotropic , this would yield a volume of 10 − 5 . ) This con ﬁ rms the trend that each of the ﬁ ve conductances had similar magnitudes for all neurons within each bird , and that these magnitudes differed greatly between birds . Considering each of the ﬁ ve conductance magnitude values pooled across all birds yielded distinctly non - Gaussian distributions . In a principal components analysis of the ﬁ ve ion conductance magnitudes , PC 1 accounted for 41 . 4 % of the variance across all modeled neurons from all birds and the other PCs were around 20 % . This indicates that there was no simple linear combination of these currents that captured most of the variation among animals . Assessing intrinsic currents in network - isolated HVC X . The modeling framework we used did not account for any current sources that potentially might arise from network activity in the slice . To control for this , we performed experiments in four animals where neurons were characterized before and after bath application of a cocktail of drugs designed to block fast synaptic transmission ( see Methods : Pharmacological manipulations ) . ( A slice was abandoned after drug treatment since washout may be incomplete , hence we recorded only one cell per slice . ) In all cases , the modeling revealed a reduction in the estimated SK current while leaving the estimates for other currents unchanged ( Fig . 4a ) . Importantly , the spike morphology of individual neu - rons was not altered after pharmacological treatment ( Fig . 4b ) , even though a small increase in the neurons ’ resting membrane potentials was observed . Thus , isolating cells from the network did not disrupt the pattern of within - bird similarity and between - bird variation in current magnitude estimates ( Fig . 4a ) . We interpret these results to indicate that the pharmacological treatment silenced inhibitory interneurons ( HVC I ) , which pro - vide substantial input onto HVC X 40 , 41 ( Fig . 1a ) . In the HH cur - rent balance equation reduction in SK current increases the overall excitability of the cell , mimicking reduction of inhibitory input . Linking intrinsic cellular properties to learning . We then turned to the powerful machinery of birdsong learning to gain insight into what factors might give rise to such unanticipated pattern of variation in the intrinsic properties of the population of HVC X neurons . Most birds were seemingly randomly distributed across the conductance magnitude parameter space ( Fig . 3c ) . To examine if instead the distribution was related to the songs of the birds , we considered the 18 birds for which we had modeled neurons and recorded songs ( see Methods : Song recordings ) . We calculated the Euclidean distances between the centroid of the conductance values for one bird and the centroids for each of the other 17 birds , and compared those distances to the similarities of the songs of the corresponding two birds , using a widely adopted standard measure of zebra ﬁ nch song similarity ( symmetrical measure comparing canonical motifs — sequences of syllables 42 ) . Strikingly , there was a strong correlation between the two measures , when the data for all birds were considered together ( linear regression of non - identical lower triangle matrix values , R = – 0 . 70 , P < 10 − 4 , t - test here and below ) , and also for 11 / 18 birds when the data for each bird was considered in isolation ( P < 10 − 3 or smaller ) ( Fig . 5a ) . Furthermore , one outlier bird gave rise to all the non - signi ﬁ cant results . When we remove White 20 , one of two birds with the fewest numbers ( N = 3 ) of HVC X recorded , all but one of the remaining birds considered individually had P values < 0 . 001 ( 16 birds ) , with the remaining one marginally signi ﬁ cant ( P < 0 . 06 ) , and with the group data yielding values of R = – 0 . 75 and P < 10 − 4 . We also examined correlations between variance nor - malized Euclidean distances ( Mahalanobis distance , see Methods : Mahalanobis distance ) , demonstrating a similar result ( data for all birds considered together , R = – 0 . 75 , P < 10 − 4 ) . We also ruled out ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14738 - 7 6 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 952 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14738 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications the possibility that network effects were dominating this calcula - tion through the contributions of the g SK estimates ( Fig . 4 ) by recalculating the conductance distances after moving g SK ( all birds including outlier , correlation of song similarity vs . modi ﬁ ed Euclidean distance , R = – 0 . 69 , P < 10 − 4 ; vs . modi ﬁ ed Mahalanobis distance , R = – 0 . 54 , P < 10 − 3 ) . Thus , remarkably , the differences in the intrinsic ion currents of HVC X in different zebra ﬁ nches were related to differences in the acoustic features of the birds ’ songs . These results motivate future work to identify which fea - tures of song best describe the variation from bird to bird in HVC X intrinsic properties , whether these are acoustic , movement - related 43 , or related to other features of song performance . Such studies may yield insight into the mechanisms linking IP with sensorimotor behavior . Song ontogeny in many songbird species continues into adulthood , well beyond sexual maturity and song crystallization . For example , in adult zebra ﬁ nches sensitivity to auditory feedback ( as measured by changes in song following deafening ) declines with age 44 . We observed concomitant age - related changes in the variance of IP , with the ﬁ ve - dimensional conductance volume of space occupied by all the neurons in each bird decreasing with age ( Fig . 5b ) . It is possible that loss of sensitivity to auditory feedback helps drive loss of variation in IP across adulthood , but future experiments are required to address whether the two are mechanistically related , and whether these relations re ﬂ ect song learning or learning independent effects of aging . A developmental basis for homogeneous intrinsic properties . One immediate implication of these results is that birds with similar songs should have HVC X with similar IP . We tested this by examining the IP of HVC X in four pairs of sibling adult birds . The siblings of each pair were raised in a breeding colony and had the same parents , but the four pairs arose from four different set of parents . As predicted by the relation between IP and song acoustics ( Fig . 5a ) , neurons from each pair of sibling birds had strikingly similar spike trains ( e . g . , Fig . 6a ) and spike waveforms ( Fig . 6b ) , which varied among the four pairs of birds . This visual impression was supported by the distributions of measurements taken from spike waveforms and spike trains ( spike rate , ﬁ rst spike interval , plateau amplitude , spike threshold , ﬁ rst spike amplitude ) , with neurons from each pair of siblings tending to cluster together but in a distinct region for each sibling pair ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . We had access to the songs of both sib - lings for three of the pairs , and con ﬁ rmed the corresponding prediction , that the songs of each pair of siblings shared very similar temporal and spectral features ( e . g . , Supplementary Fig . 9 ) , which varied among the three pairs of songs . For each pair of siblings , the HVC X occupied very similar regions in the con - ductance space ( Fig . 6c ) . This sharply contrasts with the large variation in spike waveforms , spike activity patterns , and modeled ion current magnitudes comparing pairs of randomly chosen birds ( Figs . 2 , 3 , 4 ) . Sibling birds share similar genetics , similar ages , and may follow similar vocal developmental trajectories 45 to arrive at similar adult songs . To examine if vocal developmental learning contributes to regulation of neuronal ionic conductances 17 , 18 , we made pre - liminary examination of the variation in HVC X populations in juvenile birds in the plastic song stage of song learning ( day post hatch ( dph ) : 55 ( Juv2 ) , 57 ( JuvSib1A ) , 58 ( JuvSib1B ) , 62 ( Juv3 ) ) ( n ≥ 5 HVC X / bird ) , two of which were siblings . Unlike the similarity of HVC X properties observed in each non - manipulated adult bird , the HVC X from each juvenile bird showed far more variability . This was particularly compelling comparing the data from the juvenile sibling pair with those from adult siblings . There was a substantial variation in the trains of spikes emitted by different cells within each of the two juvenile siblings ( Fig . 6d ) , far greater variation than seen in adult siblings ( Fig . 6a ) , and these differences were highly statistically signi ﬁ cant ( see Methods , Additional statistical analysis , Fig . 6d ) . The neurons from the two juvenile siblings exhibited considerable variation in spike waveforms ( Fig . 6e , left and middle panels ) . There was far more variation in spike waveforms within the juvenile siblings than in adult siblings ( cf . Fig . 6e , b , right panels ) , and this difference was highly statistically signi ﬁ cant ( see Methods , Additional statistical analyses , Fig . 6e ) .

To assess the conductance volumes , since the geometric volume was poorly de ﬁ ned in two of the juvenile birds ( with only 5 and 6 HVC X ) , we used a “ trace ” volume measurement ( see Methods : Trace volume ) . Each distribution of points in conductance space for each of the four juvenile birds occupied a larger trace volume ( mean 0 . 355 ± 0 . 12 ) than observed for adult birds . This difference between the juvenile and adult volumes was highly signi ﬁ cant ( P < 10 − 5 , unpaired t test , t = 7 . 9 , d . f . = 14 , comparing trace volumes of juveniles with trace volumes of non - manipulated adult birds with n ≥ 6 HVC X / bird ) . There is a hint of a possible age - dependent effect , with the oldest bird ( 62 dph ; Juv3 ) showing less variation than the three younger birds ( Fig . 6f ) . A characteristic of the population of juvenile HVC X neurons was that some but not all neurons exhibited little to no sag in response to hyperpolarizing current pulses , and in these cells termination of the current pulse was not followed by rebound ﬁ ring ( or in some cells was followed with simple rebound depolarization ) , similar to what has previously been reported for juvenile HVC X neurons 17 . This was expressed in the HH models of juvenile HVC X neurons as little to no variation in the g CaT conductance but large variation in the g H conductance . In general , compared with adult , juveniles exhibited greater variation in the g H and g K magnitudes than for g Na or g SK . Furthermore , all juvenile neurons were restricted to a small region of the g Na / g SK space occupied by adults ( Fig . 6f ) . Although the sample size is small , this suggests that there are initial genetic constraints on developmental variation in intrinsic properties that vary depend - ing on conductance , and that learning serves to expand some of these constraints ( e . g . , position in feature space ) while restricting others ( e . g . , variation in feature space ) . Developmental studies including cross - fostering siblings can help shed light on these constraints . The present results nevertheless indicate that HVC X intrinsic properties change during development 17 , 18 , not via purely cell autonomous phenomena but in a manner sensitive to network and behavioral constraints . Learning rapidly regulates intrinsic properties . The results suggest a role of auditory feedback in regulating HVCx IP that is ﬁ rst expressed during juvenile song learning and continues into adulthood . To directly evaluate this possibility , we turned to a technique 46 to manipulate the continuous delayed auditory feedback ( cDAF ) birds experience during singing ( see Methods : Delayed auditory feedback ) . Isolated adult birds ( hence singing “ undirected ” songs ) were exposed to between 4 h and 6 days of cDAF ( onset of cDAF was in the morning when the house lights were turned on ) , after which we made in vitro HVC X recordings from those birds . We analyzed the singing for four birds with shortest cDAF exposure , examining all songs on the baseline day just prior to and on the day of the ﬁ rst experience with cDAF . We observed clear effects of cDAF on singing behavior , preliminary observations that are consistent with more detailed observations made on other birds in an ongoing behavioral experiment . Birds tended to sing fewer songs on the ﬁ rst day of cDAF exposure compared with the preceding baseline day , and each cDAF song tended to be preceded by more introductory notes ( Table 1 ) . These effects occurred rapidly , for example they were observed for the bird with only 4 h cDAF exposure . Such rapid change in zebra ﬁ nch singing behavior has not been reported for other forms of modi ﬁ ed auditory feedback which may explain why we found concomitant rapid changes in HVC X physiology where others had not 31 , 32 . Interestingly , it was recently reported that a subset of HVC X in normal birds are active prior to the onset of singing , hence including the interval when birds are producing introductory notes 47 . Here , a compelling result was that the HVC X of the cDAF adult birds ( N = 9 ) showed enormous variation in intrinsic properties compared with non - manipulated adult birds . For example , across the 8 HVC X recorded in bird White 7 after it experienced 6 days of cDAF there was extensive variation in spike burst patterns , an almost 2× variation in spike frequency , and large variations in spike amplitudes ( Fig . 7a ; cf . Figs . 1c , 2b , 6a ) , features never observed in intact adult birds . First spike waveforms in cDAF birds also showed far more variation than 0 500 1000 1500 2000 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Euclidean distance in conductance space S ong s i m il a r i t y sc o r e a b 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Age ( dph ) V o l u m e i n c ondu c t an c e s pa c e Fig . 5 Linking intrinsic cellular properties to learning . a A 2D scatter plot for 18 birds that were modeled and whose songs were recorded .

Figs . 2a , b , 6b ) , and this effect was highly signi ﬁ cant ( see Methods , Additional statistical analyses , cDAF ) . ( There was no signi ﬁ cant change in input resistance between neurons from non - manipulated animals and neurons from animals exposed to cDAF : control , 181 ± 35 M Ω , N = 253 ; cDAF , 185 ± 24 M Ω , N = 62 , t = 0 . 98 , d . f . = 313 , P = 0 . 15 , unpaired t test ) An analysis of the associated ion currents in HVC X of cDAF birds showed a striking dissolution of the tight clustering of ion current magnitudes seen in non - manipulated birds ( Fig . 7c ) , for example , the conductance geometric volume for White7 was 0 . 084 of the “ species ” volume , or 228× the average for non - manipulated birds . Whether these results arise from the abnormal sensory feedback or the motor response to that feedback remains to be determined , but in either case the results demonstrate that intrinsic properties are dynamically regulated in adult animals in a fashion closely tied to ongoing behavior . Future studies can determine if the regulatory response was chaotic or possibly lawful , with the distribution of spike waveform shapes , conductance values , and bursting properties seen in cDAF birds perhaps re ﬂ ecting the numerous different song syntaxes and variability in other features induced by the DAF exposure 46 . The variation in intrinsic properties was particularly evident for birds with longer cDAF exposure , for example compare the spike waveforms in birds with 4 h of cDAF exposure ( Orange 168 ; Fig . 7b , right panel ) , 2 days of exposure ( Orange 148 ; Fig . 7b , left panel ) , and 6 days of exposure ( White 7 ; Fig . 7a ) . This suggested that the disruption of the clustering was related to the amount of singing the bird had experienced under the conditions of auditory feedback error and was apparent even after only 4 h of cDAF exposure ( during which Orange 168 sang 35 motifs , major units of song ) . A logarithmic relation was observed between the number of motifs each bird had sung and the trace volume of the conductance values for the HVC X of that bird ( Fig . 7d ) . A linear - logarithmic plot ( Fig . 7d , inset ) shows that all points including the 4 h point reasonably ﬁ t the logarithmic relation . The ﬁ t for cDAF birds intersected the largest volume of the 17 non - manipulated birds with ≥ 5 HVC X at 5 . 9 motifs . This estimate is approximate given that the actual relation between conductance changes and cDAF exposure is not likely to be strictly logarithmic , but nevertheless these results indicate that ongoing behavior can regulate intrinsic properties of populations of neurons on very fast time scales , possibly comparable to the time scale at which feedback modi ﬁ es singing . We observed that the cDAF birds as a population had smaller g SK values than expected , with many cDAF birds having neurons with lower values than observed for any of the non - manipulated birds ( Fig . 7c ) . Lower magnitude of g SK will manifest as increased excitation , and indeed we observed an increase in excitability of the HVC X neurons ( spike frequency ) , which was limited to the ﬁ rst day of DAF exposure ( Fig . 7e ) . This suggests a fast mechanism , such as regulation of somatic membrane ion channel density , could be the proximal mechanism giving rise to regulation of intrinsic excitability . In the steady state condition ( tested at 3 days after cDAF onset ) , the increased excitability was maintained after blocking fast synaptic connectivity , indicating that it was intrinsic to the HVC X ( Fig . 7e , Purple 19 , yellow bars ) . Collectively , our data show that HVC X IP values re ﬂ ect some experiential signal related to the singing behavior of the birds , tying regulation of intrinsic properties to the deeply investigated birdsong learning model . Discussion A growing body of evidence links modi ﬁ cation of IP to learning phenomena 2 – 4 , 17 , 18 , 48 , 49 . Here , taking advantage of an animal that produces highly precise and repeatable learned behavior , we describe features of the organization of IP at the level of indivi - dual animals . Analysis of raw data traces in response to somatic current injections showed a consistent pattern of homogeneity of HVC X intrinsic properties within individual adult birds and variation among birds . The homogeneity was maintained by plastic mechanisms . It was developmentally labile 17 , 18 , and in adults a potent form of auditory feedback manipulation 46 resulted in rapid onset and accumulating disruption of IP homogeneity . A model of the Hodgkin – Huxley form incorporating ﬁ ve known HVC X ion currents 34 did a good job of capturing these results , representing both a concise description of the observations and one hypothesis of the underlying cellular mechanisms . Whatever mechanisms give rise to the observed IP homogeneity , however , notably they are constrained by being related to features of the individual bird ’ s learned song , as shown by the results of the HH modeling . The relation between cellular properties and learning is conceptually signi ﬁ cant ; it can yield insights into the speci ﬁ cs of bird song learning but also has broader implications for neural coding . To evaluate the HH model , numerous biophysical parameters other than the principal ion currents were estimated from the literature and held constant , and possible dendritic contributions were folded into a single - compartment model . The limitations of this approach warrants careful evaluation . Variation of the bio - physical parameters otherwise ﬁ xed in our models 50 , as well as additional unknown ion channels that HVC X might express , and possibly as well similarity / variation in HVC X anatomy within and among animals , all could yield different results and affect the estimates of the current magnitudes we determined . Techniques from statistical physics applied to problems of data assimilation in high dimensional spaces provide a principled approach to this problem 51 , 52 and may help to identify if a subset of biophysical parameters are the ones shaped by birdsong learning . However , it is striking that exhaustive testing of a large space of all possible solutions tended to yield a single global minimum that was shared among all HVC X of a given bird . For example , we reported a large variation ( almost 20× ) in g Na across animals , a result that war - rants follow - up experiments with alternative techniques . This compares with neurons of the lobster stomatogastic ganglion ( STG ) which can express up to 4× variation in ion current magnitudes in different animals 53 . A comparative analysis within songbird species may help relate differences in singing behavior ( e . g . , rate , complexity , timing , precision , degree of learning ) with variation in cellular properties , and perhaps give insight into variation across taxa . Our results raise the question of how the IP of the population of HVC X neurons come to share similar values in a given animal . If homologous neurons with similar morphology receive similar synaptic input ( including feedback ) then this could tend to reg - ulate similarity of output , in part through mechanisms of IP plasticity . As well as network effects , membrane voltage itself may help to directly regulate coexpression of ion channels thus pro - viding another mechanism through which a neuron ’ s output could affect its own conductance magnitudes 54 . Known features of the functional organization of the zebra ﬁ nch song system are consistent with robust expression of these mechanisms of IP plasticity . A given zebra ﬁ nch typically sings a single precisely reproduced song motif , and both HVC X and HVC RA ( the other major class of HVC projection neurons ) tend to exhibit notable regularity in the timing of when the very high frequency brief bursts of spikes are emitted during singing 30 . Each spike burst is quite invariant and so seemingly carries relatively limited infor - mation beyond when it occurs in song 23 , 30 . Thus , within a given zebra ﬁ nch the different HVC X may receive strikingly similar inputs , have strikingly similar spike bursting activity , and this can NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14738 - 7 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 952 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14738 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 11 contribute to similar IP . Different HVC X that are active during singing , however , will emit between one to four spike bursts per song motif 30 , yet we detected homogeneity of HVC X IP in our samples . Unless our sampling in slice unknowingly biased recordings to a subset of HVC X , these considerations seemingly suggest that IP regulation occurs at the level of individual spike bursts . In toto , these are extreme features of neuronal organization expressed in a “ champion ” vertebrate model for precision of motor behavior . This suggests that IP is similarly regulated if harder to detect in other species . The same account can help to explain the relation between IP and a bird ’ s singing behavior . Although it is well established that spike timing during singing is highly regulated in HVC 23 , there remains debate as to what features of spike timing are represented in HVC during singing 43 , 55 , 56 . If , as by some accounts 43 , 57 , the activity of the population of HVC neurons during singing re ﬂ ects features of the individual bird ’ s song , then this could serve to sculpt IP of HVC neurons linked to the acoustics of each given bird ’ s song . It remains untested if the timing features of HVC X during singing vary in a systematic fashion from bird to bird . Here , we used a potent form of abnormal ( continuous delayed ) auditory feedback which induced rapid effects on singing beha - vior and HVC X IP . It would be valuable to assess HVC X supra - threshold activity under such conditions . HVC X IP are also regulated over longer time scales . A recent study 17 demonstrates that HVC X sag and rebound properties show developmental changes and variability during development . We con ﬁ rmed those results and extended them to include other features of IP , spike waveforms and excitability ( numbers of emitted spikes ) . In a subsequent study it was reported that untutored juvenile birds exhibited properties similar to adults , but that tutored juvenile birds differed from both , a seemingly paradoxical result 18 . We too observed differences between tutored juvenile birds and adults ( Fig . 6f ) , and our results may help resolve the reported paradox . Given that the prior studies focused on recording from multiple classes of HVC neurons , only few cells were recorded per cell class . This precluded sampling suf ﬁ - cient HVC X to detect the homogeneity of intrinsic properties within individual adult birds as reported here and left unresolved the distribution of HVC X IP in individual untutored juvenile birds . If prior to tutoring , HVC X intrinsic properties are broadly dispersed with each juvenile , this would not have been detected given the sample sizes of 1 – 3 HVC X / bird 18 , and small samples of neurons per bird in untutored and adult birds would both appear broadly and similarly dispersed , resolving the paradox . Future studies exploring variability of intrinsic properties within untu - tored and tutored juvenile birds may be a compelling approach to elucidating genetic and epigenetic features of developmental song learning . What is the functional signi ﬁ cance of the population homo - geneity of HVC X IP ? If all the HVC X share a common value of IP , then this represents a common baseline from which to detect small perturbations . Small variation in the HVC network could induce changes in the IP of a small subset of HVC X , perhaps manifest as changes in the timing of spike bursts . A given downstream Area X neuron could be sensitive to such changes if it compares spike bursts — perhaps with appropriate delays — received from different HVC X . The same logic extends to other , less homogeneous networks , where neurons with similar IP will tend to more reliably re ﬂ ect similar outputs for similar inputs . This suggests that stability of neuronal networks includes reg - ularization of IP , with all neurons of a given functional network or neuronal ensemble perhaps tending to share common values of IP . Such regularization would arise from dynamic processes , including learning . The regularization of intrinsic properties for neuronal ensem - bles that we report here could also manifest in synaptic organi - zation , which for technical reasons is harder to assess . Yet , we speculate that purely synaptic mechanisms are insuf ﬁ cient to explain information storage in the HVC neural network . We demonstrate that plasticity of the intrinsic excitability of ( at least ) HVC X neurons contributes to the song memory engram , pre - sumably using mechanisms known to link numerous classes of ion channels to intrinsic plasticity 58 . The variable dynamics adjusting different ion current magnitudes during learning implies an enduring memory of the prior state , one that is distinct from memories expressed at synapses and having different functional consequences , as has long been postulated 59 . Fur - thermore , our results ( especially for spike threshold ) suggest a somatic component of the plasticity of intrinsic properties that we studied . Computationally , in arti ﬁ cial neural networks this implies that the activation function of a model neuron ’ s output is itself subject to learning rules . Biologically , this can serve to integrate across synaptic inputs and / or change output properties of the neuron 60 , adding a necessary computational element that was not envisioned in synaptic plasticity accounts of learning and memory phenomena 61 .

Slices were prepared from male zebra ﬁ nches ( N = 76 birds , yielding 370 neurons ) bred at the University of Chicago : 49 non - manipulated adults ( > 90 days post hatch ( dph ) ) yielding 221 HVC X , 8 adults ( 4 pairs ) for sibling studies yielding 38 HVC X , 4 adults for pharmacological manipulations yielding 14 HVC X , 8 adults for cDAF experiments ( including one with pharma - cological manipulations ) yielding 62 HVC X , 3 adults for voltage - clamp studies yielding 9 HVC X , and 4 juveniles ( 55 – 62dph ) for developmental studies yielding 26 HVC X . Except for the siblings , all the birds were chosen at random . A subset of the birds ( N = 33 ) were anesthetized by an overdose of pentobarbital sodium and phenytoin sodium then perfused transcardially with oxygenated standard arti ﬁ cial cerebrospinal ﬂ uid ( ACSF ) which contained ( in mM ) : 119 NaCl , 2 . 5 KCl , 1 . 3 MgCl 2 , 2 . 5 CaCl 2 , 1 . 0 NaH 2 PO 4 , 26 . 2 NaHCO 3 , and 22 glucose ( osmolarity 285 – 295 mosM , ph 7 . 2 – 7 . 3 ) ; the other 44 birds were anesthetized by iso ﬂ urane and not perfused . Both solutions were prepared to the same standards , and since we noticed no apparent difference in the two groups , the data was combined across all birds for purposes of statistical analyses . Birds were decapitated , and the brains were placed in ice - cold ACSF ( pregassed with 95 % O 2 − 5 % CO 2 ) prepared with equimolar sucrose partially replacing NaCl 62 : 72 sucrose , 83 NaCl , 3 . 3 MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 CaCl 2 , 1 . 0 NaH 2 PO 4 , 26 . 2 NaHCO 3 , and 22 glucose ( osmolarity 285 – 295 mosM , ph 7 . 2 – 7 . 3 ) . Parasagittal ( or horizontal ) slices were cut ( 175 – 400 - μ m thick , Vibratome 1000 ) from both hemispheres and placed in an incubation chamber containing ACSF at 37 °C and then allowed to return to room temperature before use . Slices were incubated for at least 1h in the standard NaCl solution ( with no sucrose ) . In two birds , slices were recorded while being perfused with ACSF warmed to 37°C . We included these birds in analyzing distributions of spike burst and spike morphological features ( Fig . 2 ) but did not analyze their conductance values or include them in any subsequent analysis . Whole - cell recordings . Slices were superfused with pregassed standard ACSF ( 2 . 5 – 3 . 0 mL / min ) in a submersion chamber . HVC was visible as a dark region when transilluminated . Visually guided recordings were made using unpolished patch pipettes ( 3 – 8M Ω ) ﬁ lled with ( in mM ) 100 K - gluconate , 5 MgCl 2 , 10 EGTA , 2 Na 2 - ATP , 0 . 3 Na 3 - GTP , 40 HEPES and 0 . 5 % biocytin , pH adjusted to 7 . 2 – 7 . 3 with HCl . Tight - seal ( > 1G Ω ) , whole - cell recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B ( Axon Instruments ) , with an active bridge circuit for passing current , 10kHz low - pass Bessel ﬁ lter . Series resistance ( R s ) was estimated according to R s = 10mV / I , where I was the peak current evoked by a 10 mV test pulse . During recordings , R s was between 3 . 5 and 10M Ω before electronic compensation . Only cells that met all of the following criteria were analyzed : a gigaOhm initial seal with a smooth rupture , initial membrane potential ≤ − 65mV , a stable membrane potential throughout the recording , and consistent spiking in response to positive current injection . Voltage traces were corrected for an empirically measured liquid junction potential ( 5 − 6 mV for standard ACSF and pipette solutions ) . Most recordings were at room temperature . In one voltage - clamp experiment , we heated the bath to 37 °C . Data collection was controlled by custom software written in MATLAB . The great majority of the data were collected between 24 . 5 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14738 - 7 12 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 952 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14738 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications and 25 . 5°C ( range 23 – 26°C ) . For two of the ﬁ ve modeled conductances ( I K and I h ) , the correlation between conductance and temperature is signi ﬁ cant , but for all ﬁ ve conductances the relationships are noisy . The clustering of physiological properties on a per - bird basis is apparent for all conductances across all temperatures . For example , for all pairs of birds , comparing the difference in conductance space centroid positions as a function of the absolute temperature difference was not signi ﬁ cant ( R 2 = 0 . 079 , P = 0 . 39 ) . A technical error limits this analysis to all 68 neurons in 16 birds for which we have exact temperature data . The neurons and birds in this limited data set are distributed across almost the entirety of the range of estimated ion current magnitudes for the full data set . After the formation of a G Ω seal and achieving whole - cell access , a waiting period of 5 – 10 min followed while the cell was dialyzed with the pipette solution . A standard stimulation protocol was applied to each neuron , comprising 40pA steps that were either depolarizing ( up to 200 pA ) or hyperpolarizing ( down to − 200 pA ) . Each 200 ms current step was preceded and followed by 200 ms of quiescence . We also applied currents with mathematically de ﬁ ned complex , chaotic dynamics 52 resulting in a random mixture of ramps , sinusoids , steps and other forms . Input resistance was measured periodically during each recording and calculated from the change in membrane potential evoked by small ( 5 – 25 pA ) hyperpolarizing current steps , 200 or 300 ms in duration . Histology . We ﬁ lled neurons with 0 . 5 % Biocytin . Slices were processed using standard immunohistochemistry procedures . Mounted sections were screened for successful labeling under epi ﬂ uorescence using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal micro - scope . Images stacks were acquired with Zen2010 software ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) and viewed using ImageJ . For the developmental studies , we did not see clear axons for 2 neurons out of the 26 recorded from juvenile birds , and since physiological identi ﬁ cation of HVC X in juvenile birds was far less secure than in adult birds , we excluded these neurons from our developmental analysis . Retrograde tracers . Birds were deeply anesthetized with iso ﬂ urane and the head was secured in a stereotaxic frame . Small craniotomies over left and right Area X were made using predetermined coordinates . Tracer ( tetramethylrhodamine dex - tran ; Invitrogen ; ~ 2 – 5nl ) was delivered into Area X bilaterally via a glass micro - pipette attached to a gas pressure injection system ( Picospritzer , Parker ) . After a 6 – 7 day period for tracer transport , the birds were used for brain slice electro - physiology studies . HVC neurons that were retrogradely labeled were easily identi ﬁ ed in the recording chamber with the use of epi ﬂ uorescence illumination 34 . Unlabeled neurons were also recorded to con ﬁ rm that only retrogradely labeled cells display the physiological phenotype of the targeted HVC X neurons . Pharmacological manipulations . Pharmacological reagents were bath applied using a gravity perfusion system . Recordings were analyzed only for cells with stable R s values in both control and drug solutions . We blocked synaptic currents using a cocktail of antagonists of N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) , AMPA / kainate , GABA A and GABA B receptors : 6 - cyano - 7 - nitroquinoxaline - 2 , 3 - dione ( CNQX , 10 μ M ; no . 0190 , Tocris ) , ( RS ) - 3 - ( 2 - Carboxypiperazin - 4 - yl ) - propyl - 1 - phosphonic acid ( CPP , 10 μ M ; no . 0173 , Tocris ) , ( 3 - Aminopropyl ) ( diethoxymethyl ) phosphinic acid ( CGP 35348 , 50 μ M ; no . 123690 - 79 - 9 , Santa Cruz ) . For blocking GABA A receptors , we used picrotoxin ( PTX , 50 μ M ; no . 1128 , Tocris ) in one experiment and SR 95531 Hydrobromide ( Gabazine , 10 μ M ; no . 104104 - 50 - 9 , Santa Cruz ) in the rest . The drugs CNQX and PTX were dissolved in DMSO ( ﬁ nal concentration 0 . 1 % ) , whereas CPP , CGP 35348 and Gabazine were dissolved in water . In voltage clamp experiments we used , in addition to synaptic antagonists , the channel antagonists : tetraethylammonium chloride ( TEA , 25 mM ; no . T2265 , Sigma ) , cadmium chloride ( 300 μ M ; no . 10108 - 64 - 2 , Sigma ) , cesium chloride ( 5 mM ; no . 4739 , Tocris ) , and tetrodotoxin ( TTX , 5 μ M ; no . BML - NA120 - 0001 , Enzo ) . In one experiment , we used apamin ( 20 – 30 nM ; no . A1289 , Sigma ) , nifedipine ( 10 μ M ; no . 1075 , Tocris ) , mibefradil ( 5 μ M ; no . 116666 - 63 - 8 , Santa Cruz ) , ZD 7288 ( 30 μ M ; no . 1000 , Tocris ) , TEA , and TTX . The drugs ZD 7288 , TEA , cesium chloride , cadmium chloride and mibefradil were dissolved in water , apamin was dissolved in 0 . 05 M acetic acid , TTX was dissolved in 0 . 1M acetic acid , and nifedipine was dissolved in DMSO ( ﬁ nal concentration 0 . 1 % ) . Due to the large number of toxic drugs applied to the slice , we lost 48 % ( 8 / 17 ) of neurons during the experiments and report only those that remained healthy throughout all drug treatments . The holding potential in voltage - clamp mode was set to − 70mV , and then stepped 10 mV . MANOVA analysis . We performed MANOVA hypothesis testing on spike timing features ( Fig . 2 ) using four covariates from this data set : frequency of spiking , ﬁ rst interspike interval ( ISI ) , second ISI , and third ISI ( cells with fewer than four spikes were removed , resulting in N = 33 birds ) . The MANOVA model used was as follows : X bi ¼ μ þ τ b þ ϵ bi for b 2 f 1 ; ¼ ; N g and i 2 f 1 ; ¼ ; n b g where N is the total number of birds used and n b is the number of measurements for bird b . We assume here that ϵ bi (cid:2) N 3 0 ; Σ ð Þ μ is the overall mean response for the entire bird population , and τ b is the bird - speci ﬁ c effect with the identi ﬁ ability constraint that Σ b n b τ b ¼ 0 . To test the hypothesis that the birds have different mean vectors of covariates , one stringent null hypothesis is that they all have the same mean . This is equivalent to : H 0 ¼ τ 1 ¼ τ 2 ¼ ¼ ¼ τ N ¼ 0 The model above suggests the following decomposition of a single observation as : x bi ¼ (cid:1) x þ (cid:1) x b (cid:3) (cid:1) x (cid:1) (cid:3) þ ð (cid:1) x bi (cid:3) (cid:1) x b Þ where (cid:1) x is overall sample mean , (cid:1) x b (cid:3) (cid:1) x (cid:1) (cid:3) is the estimated bird - speci ﬁ c effect , and ð (cid:1) x bi (cid:3) (cid:1) x b Þ is the residual . The total sum of squares and products ( unnormalized covariance ) can be decomposed as follows : T ¼ X N b ¼ 1 X n b j ¼ 1 x bi (cid:3) (cid:1) x (cid:1) (cid:3) x bi (cid:3) (cid:1) x (cid:1) (cid:3) 0 ¼ X N b ¼ 1 n b (cid:1) x b (cid:3) (cid:1) x ð Þ (cid:1) x b (cid:3) (cid:1) x ð Þ 0 þ X N b ¼ 1 X n b j ¼ 1 x bi (cid:3) (cid:1) x b (cid:1) (cid:3) x bi (cid:3) (cid:1) x b (cid:1) (cid:3) 0 If we let B ¼ P Nb ¼ 1 n b (cid:1) x b (cid:3) (cid:1) x ð Þ (cid:1) x b (cid:3) (cid:1) x ð Þ 0 representing the between sum of squares and W ¼ P Nb ¼ 1 P n b j ¼ 1 x bi (cid:3) (cid:1) x b (cid:1) (cid:3) x bi (cid:3) (cid:1) x b (cid:1) (cid:3) 0 representing the within sum of squares , then T ¼ B þ W : Under the null hypothesis , B = W . If the bird - speci ﬁ c effects τ i were non - zero , this would lead to in ﬂ ation of B . The test statistic is therefore based on “ comparing ” these two matrices via W (cid:3) 1 B . A common test statistic is Wilks ’ lambda : A ¼ W j j W þ B j j ¼ 1 I þ W (cid:3) 1 B j j which depends on the data only through the eigenvalues of W (cid:3) 1 B . We reject the null hypothesis for small values of A . The MANOVA null hypothesis above is too stringent in the sense that it is rejected if the mean for any single bird is different than the rest . A more biologically relevant test compares all pairwise differences between birds . To this end , we then performed pairwise MANOVAs on the four covariates while controlling the Type - I error with the Bonferonni correction . Additional statistical analyses . All t tests reported in the main text and Methods were two - tailed , and unpaired comparisons unless otherwise noted . Figure 2c Clustering in the spike threshold / spike amplitude space . For each neuron in each bird with N > 2 neurons , we calculated the distance ( in the 2D space of spike amplitudes and spike thresholds ) to another randomly chosen neuron for that same bird and for a randomly chosen neuron in another bird . Considering all 241 neurons , the same - bird distances were smaller than the across - bird distances , and the result was highly signi ﬁ cant ( t = − 18 . 9 , df = 240 , p = 1 . 5× 10 − 49 unpaired t test ) . This con ﬁ rms the visual impression that neurons from the same bird were systematically closer to each other ( clustered ) in the space compared with neurons from other birds . Supplemental Fig . 3 : Clustering in the plateau amplitude / spike amplitude space . The equivalent analysis as for Fig . 2c ( above ) . Considering all 241 neurons , the same - bird distances were smaller than the across - bird distances , and the result was signi ﬁ cant ( t = − 18 . 8 , df = 240 , p = 3 . 5× 10 − 49 unpaired t test ) , con ﬁ rming the visual impression as per logic above . Figure 6d : Comparing spike trains in sibling juvenile and sibling adult birds . For each sibling bird , we separated the cells into groups by the number of spikes emitted . Any group with only one cell was discarded . For all cells in each remaining group , we computed all pairwise ratios of times ( relative to the start of the stimulus ) comparing ﬁ rst spikes to each other , second spikes to each other , etc . and accumulated these values across all groups for each bird . We accumulated the distribution of spike time ratios ( ﬁ rst spike i / ﬁ rst spike j , second spike i / second spike j , etc . ) across each of the two juvenile siblings then compared each juvenile against each of six adult siblings ( eliminating the two adult siblings with only two cells per bird ) . All 12 comparisons were highly signi ﬁ cantly different , with the two - sample F test statistic ranging from F ( 29 , 23 ) = 59 . 3 to F ( 20 , 23 ) = 3 . 3× 10 3 , and P = 2 . 0 ×10 − 15 or smaller . This demonstrates that the timing of spike trains in juvenile birds was consistently more variable than the timing of spike trains in adult birds . Figure 6e : Comparing spike waveforms in sibling juvenile and sibling adult birds . For the two juvenile siblings ( six cells recorded in each bird ) , we found the mean squared difference between one cell ’ s ﬁ rst spike and the ﬁ rst spikes of all cells in the other bird , yielding 36 values . We then did the equivalent analysis for all four pairs of adult siblings . Comparing the distribution of mean squared difference values from the juvenile pair with each of the adult pair , the two - sample F test statistic ranged from F ( 29 , 35 ) = 0 . 0017 to F ( 9 , 35 ) = 3 . 6× 10 − 4 , with the largest P < 8× 10 − 12 . In contrast , 3 of 6 adult siblings were not signi ﬁ cantly different from each other , and for the other three comparisons P = 0 . 0015 ( two - sample F test ) was NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14738 - 7 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 952 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14738 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 13 the smallest value . This supports the visual impression that the variation in spike waveforms among juveniles was much larger than among adults . cDAF : Spike waveforms in cDAF birds have much more variation than in non - manipulated adults . Following the logic for Fig . 6e , within each of all eight normal adult birds with ≥ 8 cells per bird , we computed mean squared spike waveform differences between all pairs of ﬁ rst spikes . These were all pooled together as the variation expected for non - manipulated birds . We then did the equivalent analysis on each of the seven adult DAF birds . Comparing the pooled normal adult data against each of the DAF birds using a two - sample F test yielded P < 2× 10 − 59 or smaller . Comparing the pooled normal adult and pooled adult DAF data yielded F ( 242 , 138 ) = 0 . 0022 , P = 2 . 9× 10 − 245 . HH model ﬁ tting . We used a single - compartment conductance - based Hodgkin – Huxley - like biophysical model of HVC X neurons 34 to estimate the magnitude of the ionic currents . The model includes the spike producing currents ( I K and I Na ) , high - threshold L - type Ca 2 + current ( I Ca - L ) , low - threshold T - type Ca 2 + current ( I Ca - T ) , a small - conductance Ca 2 + - activated K + current ( I SK ) , an A - type K + current ( I A ) , a hyperpolarization - activated cation current ( I h ) , and a leak current ( I L ) . The membrane potential of each HVC X neuron thus obeys the following current balance equation : C m dV dt ¼ (cid:3) I L (cid:3) I K (cid:3) I Na (cid:3) I Ca (cid:3) L (cid:3) I Ca (cid:3) T (cid:3) I A (cid:3) I SK (cid:3) I h þ I app where I app represents the constant DC current injected and C m is the membrane capacitance . Manual adjustment of ﬁ ve parameters ( g Na , g K , g SK , g H , and g Ca - T ) was performed to qualitatively reproduce membrane potential trajectories in response to applied step currents 34 . We ﬁ xed the value of g Ca - L because we could achieve the same accuracy of ﬁ tting by varying g SK , and so could not distinguish between the two . We ﬁ xed the value of g A because in HVC X it is a very small conductance and has weak effects on the ﬁ ring pattern 34 . Manual ﬁ tting was done blind to the ﬁ t of other cells from any given animal . All parameters for model HVC X neurons were kept the same as in Daou et al . 34 with the exception of the capacitance ( C m ) , which was set to 50 pA in adult HVC X and 75 pA in juvenile HVC X ( the latter was incremented by 50 % due to the fact the juvenile HVC neurons are bigger in size ) . For each modeled neuron , parameters were ﬁ t by iterative manual tuning for a depolarizing step of 100 pA and a hyperpolarizing step of − 140 pA . A ﬁ t was considered “ good ” if the model voltage trace matched the spike frequency , timing of individual spikes , spike amplitude , and resting membrane potential of the biological voltage trace . Critically , the validity of the model was con ﬁ rmed only if it made good predictions when presented with data sets other than the one it was ﬁ t to ( e . g . , Fig . 3a ; see text ) . Rundown . We performed further calculations to control for any unspeci ﬁ ed var - iation that might emerge in the intrinsic properties of the recorded neurons within a bird as a function of the recording time relative to when the slices were prepared on the day of the experiment . If there is any such time - dependent variation in IP values over the duration of an experiment , then it should manifest in the spike morphological data we were explicitly analyzing in the ﬁ rst cell , second cell , and so on . To evaluate this , we examined data from the 42 normal adult birds ( that is , not sibs , not juveniles , not pharmacologically manipulated , not involved in feedback experiments , etc . ) . We measure the spike amplitude for the ﬁ rst spike of each cell , then computed the ratio of ﬁ rst spike heights ( another cell / ﬁ rst cell ) . If there was rundown , then on average that ratio should systematically vary from 1 . 0 . Con - sidering N = 179 such ratios , the average was 0 . 999903 . This was not statistically signi ﬁ cantly different from 1 . 0 ( t = 0 . 1337 , df = 178 , P = 0 . 89 unpaired t test ) . Also , there was no sudden rundown late in each experiment , because when we considered the ratio of ﬁ rst spike heights ( last cell / ﬁ rst cell ) for N = 42 birds , the average was 0 . 999914 . This was not statistically signi ﬁ cantly different from 1 . 0 ( t = 0 . 0588 , df = 41 , P = 0 . 95 unpaired t test ) . The results reject the hypothesis that a principal measure of spike morphology derived directly from the raw data ( spike amplitude ) , which should be related to max g Na and max g K , varied systematically ( or hardly at all ) across experiments within each bird . We also checked whether there was any variation over the time course of days . In particular , within the group of 42 birds , we identi ﬁ ed 12 experiments conducted 1 day apart ( D = 1 ) and 10 experiments conducted 14 days apart ( D = 14 ) . For each bird , we calculated an average of all ﬁ rst spike amplitudes ( as per Fig . 3b ) , then calculated the ratio ( smaller average spike amplitude / larger average spike amplitude ) . ( We added the correction to get all values ≤ 1 . 0 because there is no con ﬁ dence whether the hypothesized variation across days should increase or decrease IP values . This was an attempt to increase the chance of arriving at a statistically signi ﬁ cant difference . ) Comparing the distributions for the D = 1 with the D = 14 groups of birds yielded a difference that was not statistically signi ﬁ cant ( t = 0 . 1823 , df = 20 , P = 0 . 8571 unpaired t test ) . This rejects the hypothesis that there were systematic differences in the results depending on intervals of days or more . Finally , we compared the D = 1 and D = 14 groups of birds with the 4 pairs of sibling birds : one pair of sib experiments conducted 1 day apart , two conducted 2 days apart , and one conducted 4 days apart . In both cases the differences between the two groups were signi ﬁ cant ( D = 1 and sibs : t = 2 . 4664 , df = 14 , P = 0 . 027 unpaired t test ; D = 14 and sibs : t = 2 . 1408 , df = 12 , P = 0 . 054 unpaired t test ) . This is remarkable given the very small sample sizes ( 4 pairs of sibs , 10 or 12 pairs of other birds ) . Thus , the difference between pairs of sibs recorded on different days and pairs of randomly chosen birds recorded on different days is compelling . All these analyses support the conclusion that our experiments were well controlled with regard to unspeci ﬁ ed variation in the recordings . Model predictions and cross - validation . To quantify the validity of the goodness of ﬁ t for the manually - adjusted models we developed an error function that attempted to capture the heuristics used for manual ﬁ tting . The error function used mean squares to compute the difference between the biological voltage trace and the model simulation by adding the individual differences between the two for each of the following features : plateau amplitude , spike amplitude , spike duration , number of spikes , the timing of each individual spike , resting membrane potential , sag ratio and rebound ﬁ ring . These features were only well de ﬁ ned for the responses to step current pulses , hence we did not estimate goodness of ﬁ t for the responses to chaotic current pulses . The ratio of the error of the prediction for non - ﬁ tted current injections , relative to ﬁ tted 100pA injections was 1 . 53±0 . 35 ( 150pA injections ) , 1 . 54±0 . 24 ( 75pA injections ) , and 1 . 69±0 . 47 ( 175pA injections ) ( N = 151 HVC X , 38 birds ) . This indicates good predictions across the population of neurons . Comparable predictions were observed for 75 and 150pA injections ( paired t = 1 . 59 , d . f . = 150 , P = 0 . 11 ) but predictions for 175pA were signi ﬁ cantly worse ( paired t = 3 . 30 , d . f . = 150 , P = 0 . 0012 , comparing 175 and 150pA predictions ) . At 175pA , the model was more excitatory than the neurons , perhaps indicating some inaccuracy in the curves for activation dynamics that we were using for the various ionic currents . To assess the goodness of prediction we conducted a cross - validation analysis . First , we picked the neuron with the best ﬁ t in each of 38 modeled birds , thereby eliminating pseudo - replication within birds and reducing the size of the data set . Then we computed ( 38 - 1 ) 2 errors ( avoiding duplicate calculations ) , each a comparison of a neuron ’ s model prediction ( for 150pA ) to the actual response of all the other 37 neurons for 150pA . Finally , we normalized these values , taking the ratio of each cross - comparison error to the corresponding error for neuron ’ s actual ﬁ t ( for 100pA ) . This measure was applied only to responses to step current pulses and not to responses to chaotic current pulses . Good ﬁ ts implied that the in vitro responses we were measuring in slice were dominated by a single compartment , and that variation of the ﬁ ve principal ion conductances was suf ﬁ cient to predict variation in responses exhibited by the actual neurons . We note that whereas network inhibition and excitation could contribute to the total current we measured for a neuron , the pharmacological manipulations in this study indicate that synaptic currents have little to no effect on spike morphology , which was used in the ﬁ tting process . The cross - validation analysis rejected the hypothesis that the prediction for 150 nA current injections was no better for the actual cell ’ s response than for the response of HVC X of other birds ( Supplemental Fig . 5 ) . The mean of the cross - validated error values was 4 . 9× greater the mean for the actual error values , and no cross - validated predictions for a given neuron were smaller than values for that neuron ’ s actual model prediction . While the null hypothesis is weak , nevertheless rejecting it demonstrates that the modeling could capture variation in responses of HVC X of different birds . Exhaustive parameter searches . We used a supercomputer ( Cray XE - 6 , 24k cores ) to conduct exhaustive parameter searches on the space of ion current magnitudes of 70 HVC X in 12 birds ( 54 neurons from 10 intact birds , 16 neurons from 2 DAF birds ) . g Na ranged between 200 and 2500 ( step size of 20 ) , g K ranged between 50 and 750 ( step size of 10 ) , g SK between 0 and 15 ( step size of 0 . 2 ) , g H between 0 and 15 ( step size of 0 . 2 ) , and g Ca - T between 0 and 10 ( step size of 0 . 2 ) . We used the error function described above ( see the ‘ Model predictions and cross - validation ’ section ) to compare model and biological traces . Therefore , for each of the 70 neurons , we examined 2 . 43 × 10 9 possible solutions spanning the 5D space . Any model simulation that generated a spike train exhibiting different numbers of spikes than the biological trace was disregarded prior to computing the error . Examining slices through the six - dimensional space of ion current magnitudes vs . model error revealed one or multiple local minima , with a single global minimum ( best model ) for that neuron residing in a distinct concavity ( Fig . 3b ) . Examining the current magnitudes that varied the most in the population ( g Na , then g SK ) , in 58 neurons , by visual inspection the manual ﬁ t was relatively close to and resided within the same concavity of the global minimum ( e . g . , Fig . 3b ) , with the global minima for neurons from the same bird clustered together albeit less tightly than for manual ﬁ ts ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . For the remaining 12 neurons ( 2 birds ) , the global minimum was distinct from the values achieved by manual ﬁ tting . Even in these cases , the values of global minima and patterns of the error functions were similar for the HVC X within each bird and varied across the HVC X of different birds ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Moreover , for all 12 of these neurons the models generated unrealistic spike morphologies ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , implicating inadequacies in the error function . These limitations notwithstanding , the results rule out that bias in manual ﬁ tting signi ﬁ cantly contributed to the pattern of variation in ionic current magnitudes within and across birds that we had observed . The main goal of the parameter searches was to test the validity of the manual ﬁ t estimates and the conclusions regarding within - bird homogeneity and across - birds heterogeneity . To this end , we noted that the parameter sets corresponding to error minima that the exhaustive searches converged to showed clear clustering of ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14738 - 7 14 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 952 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14738 - 7 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications conductances ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) , even in cases where the automated searches did not converge to the same values as the manual ﬁ ts . The discrepancies between the two is largely due to limitations in the way the error function was constructed . On occasion the automated procedures identi ﬁ ed global minima whose corresponding voltage traces were not biologically realistic , but exactly ﬁ t the duration and height of the initial components of the action potential ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . The manual ﬁ t , however , elicited a more realistic looking trace when compared with the biological recording in terms of its plateau amplitude and the smooth AHP following action potentials . Because the computed error is a summation of the difference between the model simulation and the biological recording from each of the extracted features , the minimum does not always represent the most optimal solution , although it matches one or more of these features better . Conductance volumes . An estimate of the volume V ( B ) occupied by N HVC X in bird B was calculated as follows : V ð B Þ ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 1 N (cid:3) 1 X N i ¼ 1 g Na (cid:3) g i Na ð Þ 2 þ g K (cid:3) g i K ð Þ 2 þ g SK (cid:3) g i SK (cid:1) (cid:3) 2 þ g CaT (cid:3) g i CaT (cid:1) (cid:3) 2 þ g H (cid:3) g i H ð Þ 2 n o vuut where g iX represents conductance X for neuron i , and g X represents the mean of all conductances X for the HVC X of that bird , that is g X ¼ 1 N X N i ¼ 1 g iX Note that V ( B ) is closely related to the sample covariance matrix , which is de ﬁ ned as X B ð Þ ¼ 1 b X b i ¼ 1 ð x i (cid:3) (cid:1) x Þð x i (cid:3) (cid:1) x Þ T where bird B has b HVC X . The trace of the covariance matrix , trace X ð B Þ (cid:5) (cid:6) ¼ 1 b X b i ¼ 1 k x i (cid:3) (cid:1) x k 2 ¼ V ð B Þ 2 is the sum of the eigenvalues , which measure the spread of the data along each orientation . For example , the largest eigenvalue measures the variation along the direction where the data varies the most , the second largest eigenvalue measures the variation along the second - most - varying direction , etc . The determinant of the covariance matrix ( the product of all eigenvalues ) yields a measure of the “ volume ” in the geometric sense , and we refer to this as the geometric volume . The per - formance of this measure was good especially for birds with > 6 HVC X . For instance , the volume estimates were relatively stable for different non - manipulated birds . Bootstrap and cross - validation simulations also supported this conclusion . Trace volume . Degeneracies arise when the number of observations is not large compared with the number of dimensions in the data . This can yield near - zero volumes , which are not biologically informative , especially when certain dimen - sions consistently show larger variations than the others ( e . g . , g Na and g SK ) . As a result , we modi ﬁ ed the de ﬁ nition of volume by summing the variations ( summing the eigenvalues , related to the trace of the matrix ) , and taking square root to rescale . We refer to this as the “ trace ” volume . All volumes computed ( whether for individual adult non - manipulated birds , juveniles , or cDAF birds ) were normalized with respect to the volume of the “ species ” estimated from all neurons from non - manipulated adult birds . Geometric volumes of individual birds were normalized to the “ species ” geometric volume . Trace volumes of individual birds were normalized to the “ species ” trace volume . Mahalanobis distance . Consider the maximal conductances of any bird G as an n - by - 5 matrix , where n represents the number of neurons and 5 represents the 5 maximal conductances that were varied for each neuron . Then , for any two birds G 1 and G 2 , to compute the Mahalanobis distance , we ﬁ rst computed the mean for each matrix and then took the centered data ( Cen i ) around the mean as such Cen i ¼ G i (cid:3) μ ð G i Þ where G i is the corresponding matrix for bird i ( for i = 1 , 2 ) , and μ ð G i Þ is the mean of the matrix G i . We then computed the pooled covariance ( P ) of the covariance matrices C 1 and C 2 for birds Cen 1 and Cen 2 , respectively . Finally , the distance was de ﬁ ned as D ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ x : P (cid:3) 1 : x 0 p where x ¼ μ G 1 ð Þ (cid:3) μ ð G 2 Þ This distance is different than the Euclidean distance in the sense that it is unitless and scale - invariant , and takes into account the correlations of the data set . Song recordings . Birds were isolate housed in sound attenuation booths ( AC1 , Industrial Acoustics Corp . ) . Songs were recorded with an omnidirectional micro - phone ( Earthworks SRO ) through a preamp ( AudioBuddy , M - Audio ) and USB interface ( Delta 1010 , M - Audio ) , using custom software based on the linux Jack audio toolkit . An exemplar motif was manually selected for the Euclidean / Maha - lanobis distance calculations . Delayed auditory feedback . We used an experimental procedure for exposing birds to continuous delayed auditory feedback ( cDAF ) 46 . Brie ﬂ y , songs were recorded using custom software based on the linux Jack audio toolkit . High - quality recordings of the songs of eight birds were achieved using piezoelectric accel - erometers ( BU - 1771 or 7135 , Knowles Acoustics , IL , USA ) that were chronically af ﬁ xed onto the skulls of the birds . Recording the songs by means of substrate - borne vibrations ( bone conduction ) permitted airborne playback at high gain of veridical copies of the bird ’ s songs while avoiding uncontrolled positive feedback in the system . A ﬁ xed delay of 100 ms was used in these studies . The mixture of a bird ’ s singing and the delayed song were recorded by a microphone and saved to disk along with a recording of the accelerometer signal . Such an environment can lead to immediate dys ﬂ uencies in humans and ultimately ( over longer intervals ) to striking dys ﬂ uencies in songbirds 46 . Songs were parsed from long continuous recordings using Sound Analysis Pro from birds experiencing 4 h , 1 day , and 2 days of cDAF . Noise in one of the 1 - day birds reduced the reliability of SAP parsing and we abandoned that analysis . Birds subjected to cDAF were maintained on 12 : 12 reverse day – night light schedule , typically for a week prior to any surgeries or song recordings . In birds where cDAF exposure was ≥ 1 day , the bird was captured at the end of the subjective day and slices were immediately prepared for subsequent electrophysiological experiments . The bird with 4h of cDAF exposure was killed at the end of that interval . The bird , number of neurons recorded , and total duration of cDAF exposure ( 12 h / day ) was as follows : Orange 168 ( 6 neurons , 4h ) , Pink 89 ( 8 neurons , 12 h ) , Orange 116 ( 7 neurons , 12 h ) , White 14 ( 6 neurons , 24 h ) , White 90 ( 6 neurons , 24 h ) , Orange 148 ( 8 neurons , 24 h ) , Purple 19 ( 5 neurons , 36 h ) , White 7 ( 8 neurons , 72h ) .
