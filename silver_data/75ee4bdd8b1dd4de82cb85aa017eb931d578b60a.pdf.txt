If an infectious virus spreads predominantly through large respiratory droplets that fall quickly , the key control measures are reducing direct contact , cleaning surfaces , physical barriers , physical distancing , use of masks within droplet distance , respiratory hygiene , and wearing high - grade protection only for so - called aerosol - generating health - care procedures . Such policies need not distinguish between indoors and outdoors , since a gravity - driven mechanism for transmission would be similar for both settings . But if an infectious virus is mainly airborne , an individual could potentially be infected when they inhale aerosols produced when an infected person exhales , speaks , shouts , sings , sneezes , or coughs . Reducing airborne transmission of virus requires measures to avoid inhalation of infectious aerosols , including ventilation , air filtration , reducing crowding and time spent indoors , use of masks whenever indoors , attention to mask quality and fit , and higher - grade protection for health - care staff and front - line workers . 2 Airborne transmission of respiratory viruses is difficult to demonstrate directly . 3 Mixed findings from studies that seek to detect viable pathogen in air are therefore insufficient grounds for concluding that a pathogen is not airborne if the totality of scientific evidence indicates otherwise . Decades of painstaking research , which did not include capturing live pathogens in the air , showed that diseases once considered to be spread by droplets are airborne . 4 Ten streams of evidence collectively support the hypothesis that SARS - CoV - 2 is transmitted primarily by the airborne route . 5 First , superspreading events account for substantial SARS - CoV - 2 transmission ; indeed , such events may be the pandemic’s primary drivers . 6 Detailed analyses of human behaviours and interactions , room sizes , ventilation , and other variables in choir concerts , cruise ships , slaughterhouses , care homes , and correctional facilities , among other settings , have shown patterns—eg , long - range transmission and overdispersion of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) , discussed below—consistent with airborne spread of SARS - CoV - 2 that cannot be adequately explained by droplets or fomites . 6 The high incidence of such events strongly suggests the dominance of aerosol transmission . Second , long - range transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 between people in adjacent rooms but never in each other’s presence has been documented in quarantine hotels . 7 Historically , it was possible to prove long - range transmission only in the complete absence of community transmission . 4 Third , asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 from people who are not coughing or sneezing is likely to account for at least a third , and perhaps up to 59 % , of all transmission globally and is a key way SARS - CoV - 2 has spread around the world , 8 supportive of a predominantly airborne mode of transmission . Direct measurements show that speaking produces thousands of aerosol particles and few large droplets , 9 which supports the airborne route . Fourth , transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 is higher indoors than outdoors 10 and is substantially reduced by indoor ventilation . 5 Both observations support a predominantly airborne route of transmission . Fifth , nosocomial infections have been documented in health - care organisations , where there have been strict contact - and - droplet precautions and use of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) designed to protect against droplet but not aerosol exposure . 11 Sixth , viable SARS - CoV - 2 has been detected in the air . In laboratory experiments , SARS - CoV - 2 stayed infectious in the air for up to 3 h with a half - life of 1·1 h . 12 Viable SARS - CoV - 2 was identified in air samples from rooms occupied by COVID - 19 patients in the absence of aerosol - generating health - care procedures 13 and in air samples from an infected person’s car . 14 Although other studies have failed to capture viable SARS - CoV - 2 in air samples , this is to be expected . Sampling of airborne virus is technically challenging for several reasons , including limited effectiveness of some sampling methods for collecting fine particles , viral dehydration during collection , viral damage due to impact forces ( leading Published Online April 15 , 2021 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / S0140 - 6736 ( 21 ) 00869 - 2 A p G a r o / P h a n i e / S c i e n c e P h o t o L i b r a r y Comment 2 www . thelancet . com Published online April 15 , 2021 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / S0140 - 6736 ( 21 ) 00869 - 2 to loss of viability ) , reaerosolisation of virus during collection , and viral retention in the sampling equip - ment . 3 Measles and tuberculosis , two primarily airborne diseases , have never been cultivated from room air . 15 Seventh , SARS - CoV - 2 has been identified in air filters and building ducts in hospitals with COVID - 19 patients ; such locations could be reached only by aerosols . 16 Eighth , studies involving infected caged animals that were connected to separately caged uninfected animals via an air duct have shown transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 that can be adequately explained only by aerosols . 17 Ninth , no study to our knowledge has provided strong or consistent evidence to refute the hypothesis of airborne SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Some people have avoided SARS - CoV - 2 infection when they have shared air with infected people , but this situation could be explained by a combination of factors , including variation in the amount of viral shedding between infectious individuals by several orders of magnitude and different environmental ( especially ventilation ) conditions . 18 Individual and environmental variation means that a minority of primary cases ( notably , individuals shedding high levels of virus in indoor , crowded set - tings with poor ventilation ) account for a majority of secondary infections , which is supported by high - quality contact tracing data from several countries . 19 , 20 Wide variation in respiratory viral load of SARS - CoV - 2 counters arguments that SARS - CoV - 2 cannot be airborne because the virus has a lower R 0 ( estimated at around 2·5 ) 21 than measles ( estimated at around 15 ) , 22 especially since R 0 , which is an average , does not account for the fact that only a minority of infectious individuals shed high amounts of virus . Overdispersion of R 0 is well documented in COVID - 19 . 23 Tenth , there is limited evidence to support other dominant routes of transmission—ie , respiratory droplet or fomite . 9 , 24 Ease of infection between people in close proximity to each other has been cited as proof of respiratory droplet transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . However , close - proximity transmission in most cases along with distant infection for a few when sharing air is more likely to be explained by dilution of exhaled aerosols with distance from an infected person . 9 The flawed assumption that transmission through close proximity implies large respiratory droplets or fomites was historically used for decades to deny the airborne transmission of tuberculosis and measles . 15 , 25 This became medical dogma , ignoring direct measurements of aerosols and droplets which reveal flaws such as the overwhelming number of aerosols produced in respiratory activities and the arbitrary boundary in particle size of 5 μm between aerosols and droplets , instead of the correct boundary of 100 μm . 15 , 25 It is sometimes argued that since respiratory droplets are larger than aerosols , they must contain more viruses . However , in diseases where pathogen concentrations have been quantified by particle size , smaller aerosols showed higher pathogen concentrations than droplets when both were measured . 15 In conclusion , we propose that it is a scientific error to use lack of direct evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 in some air samples to cast doubt on airborne transmission while overlooking the quality and strength of the overall evidence base . There is consistent , strong evidence that SARS - CoV - 2 spreads by airborne transmission . Although other routes can contribute , we believe that the airborne route is likely to be dominant . The public health community should act accordingly and without further delay .
