Fermentation in the Human Large Intestine Its Physiologic Consequences and the Potential Contribution of Prebiotics George T . Macfarlane , PhD and Sandra Macfarlane , PhD Abstract : The human large intestine harbors a complex microbiota containing many hundreds of diﬀerent bacterial species . Although structure / function relationships between diﬀerent components of the microbiota are unclear , this complex multicellular entity plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis in the body . Many of the physiologic properties of the microbiota can be attributed to fermentation and the production of short - chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) , particularly acetate , propionate , and butyrate . In healthy people , fermentation processes are largely controlled by the amounts and diﬀerent types of substrate , particularly complex carbohydrates that are accessible to bacteria in the colonic ecosystem . However , other factors impact on bacterial metabolism in the large gut , including large bowel transit time , the availability of inorganic terminal electron acceptors , such as nitrate and sulfate , and gut pH . They all aﬀect the types and levels of SCFA that can be formed by the microbiota . This is important because to a large extent , acetate , propionate , and butyrate have varying physiologic eﬀects in diﬀerent body tissues . Prebiotics such as galactooligosac - charides together with inulins and their fructooligosaccharide derivatives have been shown to modify the species composition of the colonic microbiota , and in various degrees , to manifest several health - promoting properties related to enhanced mineral absorp - tion , laxation , potential anticancer properties , lipid metabolism , and anti - inﬂammatory and other immune eﬀects , including atopic disease . Many of these phenomena can be linked to their digestion and SCFA production by bacteria in the large gut . Key Words : large intestine , fermentation , carbohydrate metabo - lism , short - chain fatty acids , prebiotics ( J Clin Gastroenterol 2011 ; 45 : S120 – S127 ) COLONIC MICROBIOTA In humans , the vast majority of microorganisms inhabiting the large intestine are bacteria . Protozoa are seldom detected in healthy people , but yeasts and other fungi can sometimes be recovered , although their cell population densities are low . Certain Gram - negative species such as bacteroides exist in high numbers in the large bowel , but Gram - positive anaerobic rods and cocci predominate . Several hundred diﬀerent bacterial species and strains have been isolated from fecal material and many more have been detected using molecular approaches to community analysis , but surprisingly little is known of the metabolic interactions that occur between diﬀerent groups of microorganisms in the large gut or of the ecology and multicellular organization of the microbiota . Bacterial species diversity in the gut largely derives from the multiplicity of diﬀerent carbon and energy sources that are accessible for growth and two of the principal host factors regulating the microbiota in health are substrate availability and colonic transit time . Other important determinants include competition for nutrients and space , whereas cooperative interactions between individual groups of bacteria such as those involved in the breakdown of complex polymeric substances are also signiﬁcant factors in deﬁning community structure . The microbiota is a stable and immensely complex entity , which like all climax ecosystems is to a large extent self - regulating . Although many microorganisms are able to invade and temporarily colonize the gastrointestinal tract , indigenous species aﬀord a degree of protection to the host by acting as a barrier to invading pathogens . However , the eﬀectiveness of this process is frequently diminished during illness or by antibiotic treatment . SUBSTRATE AVAILABILITY Although large numbers of amino acid fermenting bacteria and syntrophic species are present in the large bowel , the vast majority of bacteria have predominantly saccharolytic metabolisms , and as a consequence , carbohy - drate availability is almost certainly the most important nutritional factor that controls the composition and metabolic activities of the microbiota . 1 Many diﬀerent types of carbohydrate participate in fermentation processes in the large intestine , 2 and modeling studies have shown that changes in the availability of polysaccharide substrates can cause signiﬁcant shifts in luminal anaerobic popula - tions in gut fermentor systems . 3 , 4 A variety of nutritional , host , and dietary factors aﬀect the outcome of carbohy - drate fermentation reactions in the colon and because the majority of carbohydrate entering the large bowel does so in the form of polysaccharides , the rate at which these substances can be depolymerized controls the rate at which fermentable carbohydrate becomes available for assimila - tion by the bacteria . 5 From the Microbiology and Gut Biology Group , Ninewells Hospital Medical School , University of Dundee , Dundee , UK .

Copyright r 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins P RESENTATION S120 | www . jcge . com J Clin Gastroenterol (cid:2) Volume 45 , Supp . 3 , November / December 2011 Substantial amounts of starch ( 8 to 40g ) and nonstarch polysaccharides ( 8 to 18 g ) enter the human colon daily . 6 In European countries , approximately 50 % of nonstarch polysaccharides are derived from cereals , 31 % comes from vegetables , and 16 % is present in fruit , and although formed from only 10 common monosaccharides , the carbohydrate polymers found in plant cell walls are structurally diverse . 7 , 8 The physical properties of plant cell wall polysaccharides are aﬀected by the presence of lignin , which provides hydrophobic surfaces and charged groups that modify their ionic properties . 9 This can prevent access of bacterial hydrolytic enzymes that are involved in substrate depolymerization reactions . Although starches and nonstarch polysaccharides are the principal sources of carbohydrate in the large bowel , 10 nondigestible oligosac - charides are increasingly being introduced into the western diet , 11 many of which are claimed to have prebiotic properties . A wide range of mucins from the upper gastro - intestinal tract also enter the colon in ileal eﬄuent , whereas more mucus is formed by goblet cells in the colonic mucosa . In small intestinal eﬄuent , particulate substances such as partly digested plant cell materials are entrapped in a viscoelastic mucus gel , which must be broken down by bacteria in the colon to facilitate access to the food residues . PREBIOTICS The deﬁnition of a prebiotic has gone through several iterations over the last few years ; however , the deﬁnition by Pineiro et al 11 that a prebiotic is a nonviable food component that confers a health beneﬁt on the host associated with modulation of the microbiota , is as good as any that have been put up so far . To this , the following qualiﬁers can be added : ( 1 ) a prebiotic is not an organism or drug but a substance that can be characterized chemically , in most cases it will be a food grade material . ( 2 ) With respect to health beneﬁts , these should be measurable and not accrue from simple absorption of the food component into the bloodstream or result from the prebiotic acting alone . ( 3 ) It should be shown that the sole presence of the prebiotic , and the formulation in which it is being delivered , changes the composition or activities of the microbiota in the host . The majority of studies involving prebiotic oligosaccharides have been made with inulins , their fructooligosaccharide ( FOS ) derivatives , and various types of galactooligosaccharides ( GOS ) . Although a number of intestinal bacteria seem to be able to ferment these substances to a certain degree , most investigations have shown that the growth of beneﬁcial species such as biﬁdobacteria and , to a lesser degree , lactobacilli , is particularly favored . Owing to their safety , general stability , organoleptic properties , resistance to digestion in the upper gut , and fermentability in the colon , these prebiotics are being increasingly incorporated into the western diet . Inulin - derived oligosaccharides and GOS are mildly laxa - tive and can result in ﬂatulence if consumed in large amounts , but any deleterious eﬀects on bowel habit are relatively minor . Although the literature dealing with the health signiﬁcance of prebiotics is not as extensive as that on probiotics , considerable evidence has accrued showing that prebiotic consumption can have signiﬁcant health beneﬁts , particularly in relation to their inﬂuence on laxation , mineral absorption , potential anticancer proper - ties , lipid metabolism , and anti - inﬂammatory , and other immune eﬀects , including atopic disease ( for review , see Ref . 12 ) . Many of these phenomena can be attributed to prebiotic digestion by bacteria , and short - chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) production in the large intestine . FERMENTATION PROCESSES Anaerobic chemoheterotrophic communities in the colon include species that carry out anaerobic respiration , but the majority of organisms are fermentative species that generate energy through substrate - level phosphorylation reactions . In fermentation , the electron acceptors are metabolic products derived from the original substrate . As a result of this , fermentation reactions are self - balancing with the redox diﬀerential between substrates and products determining the amount of energy that can be produced . Compared with oxidative metabolism , fermentations are energetically ineﬃcient processes that give low ATP yields . Substantial amounts of substrate are therefore required for growth in fermentative bacteria , which results in large quantities of metabolic end - products being formed . Fermen - tations are governed by the need to maintain redox balance , mainly by the reduction and oxidation of ferredoxins , ﬂavins , and pyridine nucleotides . This aﬀects the ﬂow of carbon through bacteria , the energy yield obtained from the substrate , and the types of fermentation products that can be formed . In quantitative terms , SCFAs are the principal end - products generated by the colonic microbiota , whereas the formation of reduced substances ( electron sink products ) such as hydrogen gas , lactate , succinate , butyrate , and ethanol is used to eﬀect redox balance . 13 , 14 An equation describing overall carbohydrate fermentation in the large gut has been outlined by Cummings . 15 59 C 6 H 12 O 6 þ 38H 2 O ! 60 acetate þ 22 propionate þ 18 butyrate þ 96CO 2 þ 256 H þ In Vitro Modeling Studies As > 95 % of SCFAs are absorbed from the gut , measurements of these metabolites in stools does not really tell us very much about the fermentability of diﬀerent carbohydrates . However , in vitro studies , particularly those involving fecal microbiotas , can provide useful models for studying fermentation processes . The chemical composition of the growth substrate markedly inﬂuences the fermenta - tion products that can be formed by bacteria . This was demonstrated by Englyst et al , 5 who originally showed that acetate and butyrate were the principal SCFAs produced from starch by fecal bacteria , whereas acetate was the main fermentation product from both pectin and xylan . Quali - tative and quantitative diﬀerences in bioﬁlm metabolism were seen in SCFA production rates , in in vitro fermenta - tion studies , particularly when oligosaccharides served as substrates . 16 These results showed clearly that nonadherent bacteria fermented oligosaccharides considerably more rapidly than the bioﬁlm communities , whereas this was only true with highly soluble polymers such as starch and , to a lesser degree , mucin . The relatively insoluble poly - saccharide arabinogalactan associated with cell wall mate - rial was digested more rapidly by bacteria desorbed from the bioﬁlms , reﬂecting their adaptation to this substrate . It interesting to note that butyrate was primarily formed by nonadherent fecal communities , irrespective of the fermentation substrate , indicating that these bacteria are of physiological importance to the host . Fermentation of oligosaccharides was in some cases slower than the J Clin Gastroenterol (cid:2) Volume 45 , Supp . 3 , November / December 2011 Fermentation in the Human Large Intestine r 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins www . jcge . com | S121 breakdown of their more complex polysaccharide counter - parts . Indeed , in bioﬁlm bacteria , SCFA generation from xylan and arabinogalactan was faster than with the corresponding oligosaccharides . However , the molar ratios of acetate , propionate , and butyrate produced from polysaccharides and chemically similar oligosaccharides were not suﬃciently distinct to suggest that diﬀerent groups of bacteria were involved in their fermentation . This indicates that substrate uptake was a signiﬁcant factor aﬀecting fermentation rate . Inorganic electron acceptors such as nitrate and sulfate can dramatically aﬀect fermentation reactions in colonic microorganisms . 17 , 18 This can be seen in Table 1 , in which the addition of either nitrate or sulfate to fecal bacterial incubations resulted in marked reductions in the produc - tion of chemically reduced fermentation metabolites such as lactate and butyrate , with concomitant increases in acetate , which is a more oxidized metabolic end - product . Acetate is associated with increased ATP formation and increased fermentation eﬃciency . 14 As stated previously , large bowel transit time is one of the most important factors aﬀecting the structure and function of the colonic microbiota . This can be seen in results from experiments using a 3 - stage continuous culture model of the colon . 4 Vessel 1 was designed to simulate environmental and nutritional conditions in the proximal colon , whereas V2 and V3 modeled the transverse and distal colons , respectively . System retention time is analogs to colonic transit time , and the model was operated under fast ( R = 27h ) and typical western ( R = 66 . 7h ) parameters . Table 2 shows that short - retention times were associated with higher speciﬁc rates of carbohydrate utilization and a lower percentage of substrate utilization in vessel 1 . This enabled more carbohydrate to become available for bacterial growth in vessel 2 . In terms of bacterial metabolic processes , this resulted in increased SCFA production rates and greatly enhanced fermentation eﬃciencies in every part of the model system ( Table 3 ) . When placed in an in vivo context , these data indicate that faster colonic times are linked to higher energy recoveries by the host due to increased breakdown of digestive residues by colonic microorganisms . Studies on FOS and GOS fermentation by fecal bacteria show that both prebiotics are butyrigenic . At concentrations of 10 g / l , FOS , GOS , and inulin were shown to increase acetate and butyrate formation in pH - controlled fermentors , with transient accumulation of lactate . 19 This can also be seen in Table 4 . Interestingly , acetate and lactate formation are consistent with biﬁdobacterial and lactobacillus metabolism , but butyrate is not produced by these organisms , showing that other species are involved in prebiotic digestion . Potential mechanisms whereby FOS and GOS can act as butyrate sources were provided by Belenguer et al , 20 who showed how butyrate - producing species such as Anaerostipes caccae and Eubacterium halli could cross - feed on lactate produced by Biﬁdobacterium adolescentis growing on FOS , while a nonlactate utilizing , butyrate - forming Roseburia sp . could assimilate carbohy - drate fragments formed from the hydrolysis of complex polymeric substances by the biﬁdobacterium . PHYSIOLOGIC SIGNIFICANCE OF CARBOHYDRATE FERMENTATION Although the most obvious metabolic eﬀects of carbohydrate breakdown by intestinal bacteria are asso - ciated with the biochemical eﬀects of SCFA in human body tissues , the signiﬁcance of saccharolytic metabolism is more widespread . For example , laxative eﬀects resulting from increased bacterial cell mass increase colonic transit times . Thus , digestive materials move through the large bowel faster , giving less time for signiﬁcant levels of protein breakdown and amino acid fermentation to occur . This means that less putrefactive substances , such as ammonia , phenols , indoles , amines , and hydrogen sulﬁde , accumulate in gut contents . The inhibitory eﬀects on toxin accretion in the large bowel are also due to low pH conditions resulting from carbohydrate fermentation and increased biosynthetic requirements for nitrogen - containing precursors during saccharolytic bacterial growth . 21 , 22 PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF SCFA Acetate Acetate has a multiplicity of eﬀects on mammalian physiology . In colonic tissues , it has been shown that there is a concentration - dependent reduction in the frequency of spontaneous longitudinal muscle contractions in rat colonic smooth muscle , 23 whereas this SCFA stimulates prolifera - tion of normal crypt cells . 24 Acetate also enhances ileal motility and increases colonic blood ﬂow , 24 and it may have a role in adipogenesis , through interacting with the G protein - coupled receptor GPCR43 on adipose tissue . 25 With respect to the host immune system , acetate has been shown to interact with GTP - binding proteins ( GPCR43 and GPCR41 ) in immune cells , 26 , 27 whereas it activates the free fatty acid receptor FFA2R on leucocytes . 28 Acetate has also been reported to reduce lipopolysaccharide - stimulated tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) a release from human neutrophils and to TABLE 1 .

It is the principal fuel for intestinal epithelial cells and plays an important role in maintaining colonic health . Acetate , propionate , and butyrate are all metabolized to some extent by the epithelium to provide energy , but butyrate is especially important as a fuel for these cells and may also play a critical role in moderating cell growth and diﬀerentiation . The colonic epithelium derives 60 % to 70 % of its energy from bacterial fermentation products . 53 – 55 Experiments on CO 2 formation using mixtures of SCFA indicate that cellular activation is in the order of butyrate > propionate > acetate . SCFA are metabolized to CO 2 and ketone bodies and are precursors for mucosal lipid synthesis . More than 70 % of oxygen consumption in isolated colonocytes is due to butyrate oxidation , although there are regional differences in enter - ocyte energy metabolism in the large bowel . 56 The uptake and utilization of butyrate by the colonic epithelium have been demonstrated from the study of levels of SCFA in portal and arterial blood and in colonic contents . SCFA measurements in body tissues shows that the molar propor - tion of butyrate falls from 21 % in the gut lumen to 8 % in portal blood , indicating a 65 % clearance by the mucosa . 57 Butyrate exhibits a range of anti - inﬂammatory proper - ties and has been shown to restore intestinal permeability by TABLE 3 .

The eﬀect of this fatty acid on cellular diﬀerentiation is related to the control of gene expression . This aﬀects many cellular processes , including the induction of hemoglobin synthesis in murine erythroleukemia cells , EGF receptors in hepatocytes , plasminogen activator synthesis in endothelial cells , thyroid hormone receptors in the pituitary gland , metallothionein in hepatoma cells , estrogen , prolactin , and EGF receptors in breast tissue cells . In colorectal cancer cells , a number of changes in gene expression can be seen such as the induction of c - fos , PLAP , and carcinoembryonic antigen ; inhibition of uroki - nase and release of plasminogen activator inhibitor ; and the expression of brush border glycoprotein and P - glycopro - tein . The induction of diﬀerentiation in tumor cell lines is associated with changes in cytoskeletal architecture and their adhesion properties ; butyrate induces apoptosis in human colonic carcinoma cells and may be protective in colorectal cancer . 66 – 71 It inhibits tumor cell progression by inhibiting decay - accelerating expression 72 and prometa - static metalloproteinase activation 73 and protects against chromosome - induced damage in human colon carcinoma cells . 74 The migration and invasion potential of Ht1080 tumor cells is also inhibited . 75 Butyrate modulates vascular endothelial growth factor and hypoxia - inducible factor - 1 a angiogenesis - related proteins , which leads to inhibition of tumor - induced angiogenesis . 76 , 77 It hyperinduces Wnt transcriptional activity in colorectal cancer cell lines , induces apoptosis , and may protect against colorectal cancer . 78 Butyrate reduces in vitro lymphocyte proliferation in mice and rats . 79 , 80 This SCFA therefore modulates the expression of a wide range of genes associated with cell proliferation , differentiation , and apoptosis . 81 Butyrate has been found to exert a number of protective eﬀects against oxidative H 2 O 2 - induced DNA damage in isolated human colonocytes and HT29 tumor cells . 82 It was shown to increase levels of the antioxidant glutathione in mucosal biopsies from the sigmoid colon of healthy volunteers given daily butyrate enemas , 83 whereas butyrate enemas resulted in increased transcriptional regulation of fatty acid metabolism as well as electron transport and oxidative stress pathways in the colonic mucosa of healthy volunteers . 84 In vitro studies have supported these ﬁndings and have shown that it is able to modulate the expression of genes associated with oxidative and metabolic stress in human colonic cells . 85 Barrier function in the gut is enhanced by butyrate , in which it upregulates the expression of mucin - associated genes ( MUC1 - 4 ) in intestinal epithelial goblet cells . 86 Administration of rectal enemas to mice increases colonic expression of secreted Muc2 and membrane linked ( Muc1 , Muc3 , Muc4 ) genes , but eﬀects a reduction in adherent mucus layer thickness . 87 Butyrate aﬀects the expression of tight junction proteins such as zonulin and occludin , 88 and even low concentrations promote intestinal barrier function and reduce epithelial permeability . 89 Interestingly , it has been shown to reduce translocation of Escherichia coli across metabolically stressed dinitrophenol - treated epithe - lial human colonic T84 and HT29 cell lines . 90 A range of other physiologic attributes have been linked to butyrate . Similar to propionate , butyrate promotes satiety and has been found to increase the expression of peptides involved in the regulation of appetite such as peptide YY and proglucagon in rat epithelial cells 91 and to downregulate the expression of the neuroendocrine factor leptin in rat anterior pituitary cells . 92 Oligofructose con - sumption has been reported to promote satiety in humans , which is suggested to be due to increased production of SCFA such as butyrate , 93 which also reverses and prevents diet - induced insulin resistance in mice . 94 Rectal enemas are known to reduce visceral sensitivity in healthy volunteers , 95 and butyrate has been shown to regulate enteric neuronal function and to control intestinal motility in rats , 96 whereas increased butyrate concentrations in the large bowel of rats eﬀectuated by feeding butyrylated starch have been reported to reduce colonic smooth muscle contractility . 97 CONCLUSIONS The breakdown of complex carbohydrates is one of the most important processes carried out by bacteria growing in the human large intestine . Through fermenta - tion and SCFA formation , the colonic microbiota plays a central role in biochemical and physiologic processes in the large bowel and in remote body sites . Fermentation is regulated , in large part , through substrate availability in the colon . This ultimately aﬀects the way in which diﬀerent fatty acids , such as acetate , propionate , and butyrate , are produced . The metabolic signiﬁcance of this to the host is that in many respects , individual SCFA are handled in diﬀerent ways by the body . For example , butyrate , in particular , has been linked with energy generation by the colonic epithelium , and has a variety of anticancer proper - ties , whereas propionate is most often associated with lipid metabolism . Work over the last 2 decades has shown consistently that prebiotic oligosaccharides such as FOS and GOS escape digestion in the upper gut but are fermented by bacteria inhabiting the large intestine . There is a growing body of evidence that shows that prebiotics have a diverse range of health beneﬁts , particularly in relation to their inﬂuence on microbial ecology in the gut , mineral absorption , laxation , potential anticancer proper - ties , and lipid metabolism , together with anti - inﬂammatory and other immune eﬀects , including atopic disease . Many of these phenomena can be attributed to fermentation processes and SCFA production in the large bowel .
