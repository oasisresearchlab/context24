Differential regu - lation of ERK1 / 2 and p38 MAP kinases in VacA - induced apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells . Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Phys - iol 294 : G635 – G647 , 2008 . First published December 20 , 2007 ; doi : 10 . 1152 / ajpgi . 00281 . 2007 . — Helicobacter pylori vacuolating cytotoxin A ( VacA ) has been considered as an apoptosis - inducing factor . Here , we investigated the mechanism of VacA - induced apo - ptosis in relation to the defense mechanism and MAP kinases pathway in gastric epithelial cells . AGS cells exposed to enriched VacA extracts affected the level of SOD - 1 and villin . We further investi - gated the role of VacA in those inductions using a functional recom - binant VacA ( rVacA ) . Activation of p38 MAPK and Bax dimerization by rVacA were increased in a dose - dependent manner . rVacA - in - duced ERK1 / 2 MAPK activation was maximal at 30 min and 4 h and 1 – 4 (cid:1) g / ml of rVacA . rVacA - induced SOD - 1 expression was consid - erably diminished by inhibiting ERK1 / 2 MAPK and it was slightly increased by inhibiting p38 MAPK . rVacA increased or decreased villin expression depending on dose and exposure time and its ex - pression was mainly appeared in the contractile actin ring of the dividing cells . Despite its cytoprotective effect , SB - 203580 , a p38 inhibitor , was unlikely to reduce VacA - induced Bax dimerization and rather inhibited villin and Bcl2 expression , indicating that p38 may also play a role in cell proliferation or differentiation for survival after VacA intoxication . Furthermore , p38 inhibitor accelerated rVacA - induced cell death after exposure of AGS cells to H 2 O 2 but ERK1 / 2 inhibitor protected cells from H 2 O 2 insult . These results suggest that SOD - 1 and villin are expressed differentially upon VacA insult depending on dose and exposure time via ERK and p38 MAP kinases ; decrease in SOD - 1 and villin expression coupled with Bax dimeriza - tion leads to apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells . Helicobacter pylori ; VacA ; SOD - 1 ; villin ; MAP kinase signaling VACUOLATING CYTOTOXIN ( VacA ) , a product of vacA s1 / cagA - positive Helicobacter pylori strains , induces large cytoplasmic vacuoles in epithelial cells with structural and functional changes , leading to apoptosis that is , in part , responsible for H . pylori - induced epithelial cell damage ( 13 , 31 , 48 ) . Puriﬁed VacA and recombinant VacA ( rVacA ) induced apoptosis ( 21 , 40 ) that was via a mitochondria - dependent pathway , stimulat - ing cytochrome c release ( 28 , 65 ) . To the contrary , Caputo et al . ( 18 ) reported that VacA was associated with H . pylori - induced VEGF upregulation , which depends on the activation of the EGFR and MAP kinase cascade . The exclusive role of VacA in apoptosis , therefore , may be questionable . Epidemiological studies have shown that gastric cell damage is associated with disruption of cytoskeletal structure ( 26 , 62 ) and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) ( 10 , 16 ) . The protection of cells against them is a pivotal mechanism for cell survival . In the meanwhile , the gastritis induced by H . pylori infection stimulates the generation of ROS by the inﬂammatory cells present in the mucosa , resulting in gastric cell apoptosis which is strongly associated with atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer ( 20 , 39 , 44 , 57 , 71 ) . By multivariate logistic regression anal - ysis , the association of VacA with risk of glandular atrophy and intestinal metaplasia was increased in H . pylori - positive mucosa in our unpublished data . Thus we need to investigate how VacA contributes to the pathogenesis of gastric mucosa after H . pylori infection in relation to MAP kinase pathways that mediate proliferation , differentiation , apoptosis , and stress ( 9 , 17 , 23 , 36 , 72 ) . Superoxide dismutases ( SOD ) are essential enzymes that eliminate superoxide radical and hence protect cells from damage induced by free radicals ( 33 ) . Loss of SOD - 1 leads to severe damage of mitochondria in neuroblastoma cell ( 5 ) , senescence in cultured ﬁbroblasts , and apoptotic cell death in HeLa cells ( 12 ) as well as in spinal neurons ( 59 ) . Villin , an actin - binding protein , is an important marker of the preneo - plastic cell type and induces enhanced motility and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton contributing to the wound healing and cell proliferation ( 56 ) . Deﬁciency for the villin gene in mice can organize microvilli in brush border but limits the severing of actin ﬁlaments in response to cellular injury , resulting in a deﬁciency in wound repair and cell motility , therefore leading to cell death in response to chronic injury ( 8 , 51 ) . Herein , we show that the activation of the MAP kinase cascade on VacA stimuli could subsequently trigger changes in SOD - 1 and villin expression and affect cellular apoptosis and proliferation .

Polymerase chain reaction and plasmid construction . Primers were designed to amplify a vacA fragment encoding the mature VacA ( 43 ) from H . pylori strain ATCC 49503 ( GeneBank accession no . U05676 ) . The sequences of sense primer with an Nde I site and antisense primer with a Xho I site were 5 (cid:2) - ggaattcCATATGTTTTT - TACAACCGTGATCA - 3 (cid:2) and 5 (cid:2) - ccgCTCGAGAGCGTAGCTAGC - GAAA - 3 (cid:2) , respectively . The parameters for PCR were 94°C for 2 min , (cid:3) 1 ; 94°C for 30 s , 45°C for 30 s , 68°C for 2 min , (cid:3) 10 ; 94°C for 30 s , 45°C for 30 s , 68°C for 2 min (cid:4) 5 s increase per cycle , (cid:3) 20 ; 68°C for 7 min , (cid:3) 1 . The resulting PCR product was digested with Nde I and Xho I and ligated to the pET 41b ( (cid:4) ) digested with the above - mentioned restriction enzymes to create plasmid pVAC953 . The recombinant plasmid contains the vacA fragment encoding the mature VacA cytotoxin ( amino acids 34 to 854 , including the A34M substitution ) with an octa - His tag at the carboxy terminus was ampli - ﬁed in Escherichia coli DH5 (cid:2) ( ECOS 101 ) . The insert DNA was analyzed with T7 promoter ( 5 (cid:2) - TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG - 3 (cid:2) ) or T7 terminator ( 5 (cid:2) - GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG - 3 (cid:2) ) by a se - quencing analyzer ( Genotech , Daejeon , Korea ) . Production of recombinant VacA . E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) was trans - formed by 1 ng of pVAC953 and kanamycin - resistant clones were selected . One colony bearing pVAC953 was inoculated into 5 ml of Luria Bertani broth containing 30 (cid:1) g / ml of kanamycin and grown at 37°C overnight with shaking . The overnight cultures were diluted 1 to 100 into Terriﬁc broth supplemented with 0 . 5 % glucose and 30 (cid:1) g / ml of kanamycin and were incubated at 24°C until they reached an optical density of 0 . 4 – 0 . 6 at 600 nm . These cultures were induced with 0 . 1 mM of isopropyl - (cid:5) - D - thiogalactoside ( IPTG ) and incubated at 24°C for 20 h more . E . coli soluble extracts were prepared as follows . Around 100 ml volume of IPTG - induced cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 5 , 000 rpm for 10 min and resuspended in a 20 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl ( pH 7 . 9 ) , 0 . 5 M NaCl , 5 % glycerol , 0 . 5 % NP40 , protease inhibitor cocktail ( Complete mini , Roche Germany ) , 1 mM PMSF ( Roche ) , and 0 . 5 mg / ml egg white lysozyme ( Sigma ) . The bacterial suspensions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then treated with freezing at (cid:6) 70°C and thawing at 37°C three times . After three successive rounds of freeze - thaw , DNase , RNase , and MgCl 2 were added to a ﬁnal concentration of 20 (cid:1) g / ml , 10 (cid:1) g / ml , and 10 mM , respectively . The bacterial suspensions were incubated on ice for 30 min and then sonicated for 1 min ( Sonics & Materials , Vibra Cell , pulse ; 2 s , Amp ; 30 W ) . The bacterial lysate were centrifuged at 12 , 000 g for 10 min at 4°C to remove insoluble cell debris . The supernatant was used for puriﬁcation using His - Bind afﬁnity chromatography ( Novagen ) . The puriﬁcation of rVacA toxin was performed according to the manufac - turer’s protocol . Brieﬂy , the ﬁrst pool of fractions eluted with 0 . 5 M imidazole by His - Bind column chromatography were reloaded into another His - Bind column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl ( pH 7 . 9 ) supplemented with 0 . 5 M NaCl , 0 . 02 % NP - 40 , 0 . 2 % glycerol , and 0 . 1 M imidazole . The eluate with 0 . 5 M imidazole by the second chro - matography was dialyzed against PBS and used in this study as a recombinant vacuolating cytotoxin . Production of the polyclonal anti - rVacA antibodies raised in rab - bit . New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with intradermal injections of 50 (cid:1) g of rVacA , mixed with Freund’s adjuvant . Immu - noglobulins were puriﬁed by using rProtein G - Agarose ( GIBCO - BRL ) . This immunoglobulin recognized VacA in immunoblot not only with the (cid:7) 89 kDa s1 / m1 type but also with the (cid:7) 92 kDa s2 / m2 type . Assay for vacuolating activity and cell viability . Vacuolating activity was assessed according to Cover et al . ( 22 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were seeded at 2 – 5 (cid:3) 10 4 cells per well into 96 - well plates and were grown overnight . The grown cells were washed with PBS and overlaid with a serum - free culture medium in the presence or absence of 10 mM NH 4 Cl to which H . pylori saline extract or H . pylori culture broth was added . Then cells were incubated for varying time at 37°C in a 5 % CO 2 incubator . If necessary , the cells were incubated with rVacA for varying time or with varying concentrations .

HSE and VacA enrichment by partial puriﬁcation as nVacA sam - ple . Saline extracts were prepared by harvesting bacteria ( ATCC 49503 ) in 0 . 9 % of NaCl from blood agar culture for 36 to (cid:7) 48 h . The suspensions were gently vortexed and centrifuged at 4 , 000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C and then ﬁltered with a 0 . 22 - (cid:1) m syringe ﬁlter . In some experiments , H . pylori saline extract ( HSE ) was preincubated fo r 1 h on icewith neutralizing anti - VacA antibody before addition to the cells . Alternatively , HSE was immunode - pleted by preincubation fo r 1 h on icewith neutralizing anti - VacA sera or nonimmunized sera and protein A - Sepharose ( Invitrogen ) . After removal of immune complexes by centrifugation , the super - natant was tested for residual activity . For partial puriﬁcation of VacA , HSE was precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 50 % saturation , centrifuged for 20 min , 4°C , at 12 , 000 rpm . The pellet was dissolved in 50 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) and then dialyzed against two changes of 50 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 6 . 0 ) at 4°C ; reprecipitated materials were removed by centrifugation and loaded onto CM - Sephadex ( Pharmacia ) preequilibrated in phos - phate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 ) . After a column chromatography , VacA was mainly existed in unbound fractions which was devoid of albumin and used for native VacA , designated as “nVacA . ” nVacA was immunodepleted of CagA by incubation with anti - CagA antibody C - 300 bound to Protein A Sepharose ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and then ﬁlter sterilized via a 0 . 2 - (cid:1) m ﬁlter . AGS cells exposed to various H . pylori or VacA samples . Subcon - ﬂuent monolayer of AGS cells on a six - well plate was cocultured for 5 h with H . pylori in the presence or absence of anti - rVacA antibodies in a serum - free medium containing 10 mM NH 4 Cl and then the cells were lysed in a 2 (cid:3) SDS sample buffer . The effect of rVacA was assessed by AGS cells treated with indicated amounts of rVacA for various incubation periods in the presence or absence of anti - rVacA antibody or NH 4 Cl . If necessary , anti - VacA antibody , 5 - nitro - 2 - ( 3 - phe - nylpropyl - amino ) benzoic acid ( NPPB ) , PD - 98059 , or SB - 203580 was pretreated for 30 min prior to addition of rVacA . The lysed cells were subjected to SDS - PAGE and immunoblot . Immunoblot analysis . Samples were separated by SDS - PAGE , transferred to Immobilin - P membrane ( Millipore ) . The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 3 % BSA in TBST ( 10 mM Tris (cid:1) HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) followed by incubating with primary antibody at a appropriate dilution in TBST containing 3 % BSA overnight at 4°C . After being washed three times with TBST for 10 min each , the membranes were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase .

The effect of H . pylori infection or rVacA on the expressions of (cid:5) - actin , Bax , Bcl - 2 , pERK1 / 2 , ERK2 , pp38 , p38 , SOD - 1 , (cid:5) - tubulin , and villin were assessed by AGS cells treated with various VacA samples with respective antibodies : anti - (cid:5) - actin , anti - Bax , anti - Bcl - 2 , anti - ERK2 , and anti - p38 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnol - ogy , ) , anti - villin ( Chemicon ) , anti - Cu / Zn SOD ( Stressgene ) , anti - pERK1 / 2 , anti - pp38 ( Cell Signaling ) , and anti - (cid:5) - tubulin ( Sigma ) . DAPI staining . The induction of apoptosis of cells by rVacA was assessed by DAPI ( 4 (cid:2) , 6 (cid:2) - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ) ( Roche - Boehringer , Mannheim , Germany ) staining . In brief , the cells on a slide glass were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde followed by washing with PBS and staining with a 1 (cid:1) g / ml DAPI solution for 10 min . The slides were then viewed under a ﬂuorescence microscope ( Nikon ) . FITC - immunoﬂuorescence staining of AGS cells . rVacA with or without anti - VacA antibody - treated AGS cells were washed in PBS , ﬁxed with cold acetone for 10 min at room temperature , and then washed in PBS three times . Anti - villin antibody ( 1 : 50 ) was incubated for 1 h atroom temperature and washed in PBS three times followed by incubation with the FITC - conjugated anti - mouse secondary anti - bodies ( National Veterinary Research & Quarantine Service , Korea ) for 30 min at 37°C . After the washings , the coverslips were mounted on the glass microscope slide with a drop of 50 % glycerol PBS solution ( pH 8 . 0 ) . The cells were analyzed with an Olympus ﬂuores - cence microscope . Microscopic imaging . Cells were visualized with TMS phase - contrast inverted microscopes ( Nikon ) . Images were edited via Adobe PhotoShop 7 . 0 and Power Point . RESULTS Comparative analysis of the activity of native and recombi - nant VacA inducing vacuolation and apoptosis . After incuba - tion for 8 h , rVacA increased neutral red uptake in AGS cells in a dose - dependent manner up to 0 . 8 (cid:1) g / ml but decreased at higher concentration ( Fig . 1 A ) . After AGS cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of rVacA for 24 h in serum - free media , cell viability was measured according to the ability of living cells to reduce the uncolored MTS substrate to a colored product ( Fig . 1 C ) . As shown in Fig . 1 C , rVacA induced mild dose - dependent apoptosis in AGS cells . To compare the activ - ity of rVacA to that of the native version , the vacuolation and apoptosis by native protein with HSE were assessed ( Fig . 1 , B and D ) . The concentration of VacA in HSE was determined from the rVacA standard by antigen - capture ELISA . The concentration of VacA corresponded to (cid:7) 1 % of the total protein of HSE ( data not shown ) . As shown in Fig . 1 B , however , the vacuolating activity of 50 (cid:1) g / ml of HSE coin - cided with that of 0 . 8 (cid:1) g / ml of rVacA . From the result , the activity of rVacA was supposed to be (cid:7) 60 % of that of nVacA . While the vacuoles induced by nVacA were formed less than 4 h after addition of HSE and maintained during incubation for 10 – 20 h , and ﬁlled the entire cytoplasm , those induced by rVacA were formed slowly , somewhat defective and localized at the late endosomes . Furthermore , the perinuclear vesicles aggregates appeared to be collapsed , implying rVacA might disrupt actin cytoskeleton structure ( Fig . 1 E ) . Epithelial cell vacuolation and apoptosis induced by VacA . To conﬁrm the role of VacA in H . pylori - induced apoptosis , AGS cells were treated with various VacA preparations ( Fig . 2 A ) . VacA - immunodepleted HSE showed signiﬁcantly reduced VacA level by (cid:7) 70 % of control whereas nonimmunized sera did not change the VacA level of treated HSE . ERK1 / 2 signal was activated differently according to the various VacA prep - arations , wherein ERK1 / 2 activation by s1m1 vacA HSE with - out anti - VacA antibody was higher than in any other HSE treated AGS cells during a 2 - h period ( Fig . 2 B ) . Vacuolating Fig . 3 . Effects of various H . pylori strains on the indicated protein expression in AGS cells . AGS cells were cocultured with the indicated H . pylori stains fo r 5 h in aserum - free medium . After a 5 - h incubation period , AGS cells were washed in PBS and then lysed with 2 (cid:3) SDS sample buffer . The lysed cells were assessed for CagA and VacA bound to cells by immu - noblotting . A : the AGS cells transfected with ATCC 49503 were extensively vacuolated whereas (cid:7) 50 % of the AGS cells were vacuo - lated when transfected with HpKm , an s1 / m1 vacA genotype . Expectedly , AGS cells infected with ATCC 51932 ( s2 / m2 vacA / cagA (cid:6) ) were not vacuolated except vacuoles induced by NH 4 Cl - like negative control ( Ctrl ) . B : a high level of VacA was produced by ATCC 49503 ( s1m1 vacA / cagA (cid:4) , Western type , ABC ) com - pared with that produced by HpKm ( s1m1 vacA / cagA (cid:4) , Western type , ABCCC ) , which was in accordance with the extent of vacuola - tion by respective H . pylori strain . The lysed cells were assessed for phosphorylated ERK1 / 2 , SOD - 1 , villin , and (cid:5) - tubulinbyanimmunoblotting . C : relative expression level to (cid:5) - tubulin determined from B .

Cell viability was inversely proportional to vacuolating activity and the level of VacA ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . The cell viability of AGS cells treated with s1 / m1 vacA HSE was higher than that of AGS cells treated with VacA - depleted or PBS control at the incubation time of 4 h but it was decreased than VacA - reduced HSE or HSE plus anti - VacA antibody at the incubation of 20 h , suggesting that VacA induces not only cell proliferation at early time but also cell death of the AGS cells after prolonged exposure to it . Comparative analysis of morphological change and protein expression of AGS cells cocultured with various H . pylori strains . Epidemiological studies have shown that gastric cell damage infected with H . pylori is associated with disruption of cytoskeletal structure ( 26 , 62 ) and ROS ( 10 , 16 ) . To determine the role of VacA in gastric cell damage by H . pylori infection , the levels of SOD - 1 , a ROS scavenger enzyme and villin , an actin - binding protein , were assessed in AGS cells cocultured for 5 h with H . pylori . AGS cells infected with ATCC 49503 showed extensive cell vacuolation , disruption of cell - cell con - tacts and altered cell morphology ( Fig . 3 A ) . The level of VacA protein corresponded with the degree of vacuolation of AGS cells ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) . These two strains have same vacA allelic type ( s1m1 type ) but different cagA subtype ; CagA phosphorylation site is “A - B - C” in ATCC 49503 , “A - B - C - C - C” in HpKm . H . pylori induced ERK activation indepen - dently of the vacA type or the presence of cagA . But the level of ERK activation was the highest in AGS cells treated with ATCC 49503 . The level of SOD - 1 was slightly decreased in AGS cells with toxic VacA positive strains and the level of villin was slightly decreased in ATCC 49503 or ATCC 51932 - treated AGS cells ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . Time - course comparison of ERK1 / 2 , SOD - 1 , and villin expression upon s1m1 HSE . ATCC 49503 induced ERK acti - vation and decreased SOD - 1 and villin expression compared with negative control . Next , we investigated the effects of VacA on those protein expressions depending on incubation time using HSE of ATCC 49503 . The HSE activated ERK1 / 2 at 1 h and lasted thereafter in a time - dependent manner over an 8 - h period ( Fig . 4 ) . SOD - 1 expression was increased at 1 h , reached maximal at 2 h , and decreased thereafter in a time - dependent manner . Villin was decreased in a time - dependent manner by 1 h and was then reinduced thereafter . ERK acti - vation appeared to be associated with the increase in SOD - 1 expression and the decrease in villin expression at 1 h . p38 MAPK and Bax mediate rVacA - induced apoptosis and requirement of ERK activation for cell survival . To conﬁrm the signiﬁcance of ERK1 / 2 , SOD - 1 , and villin in VacA - induced apoptosis , we investigated cellular expression of those proteins including Bax , Bcl2 , and p38 upon functional rVacA stimula - tion . AGS cells treated with rVacA during varying incubation times were analyzed for DNA damage , ERK and p38 activa - tion , and Bax , Bcl2 , villin , and SOD - 1 expression ( Fig . 5 , A – C ) . As shown in Fig . 5 A , nucleus condensation and fragmentation were found in DAPI - stained AGS cells at 16 h . The extent of DNA fragmentation was determined by a direct counting of the number of apoptotic nuclei ( Fig . 5 B ) . As shown in Fig . 5 C , ERK1 / 2 activation induced by rVacA exhibited a biphasic time course , the early component peaking at 30 min and the late component at 4 h and then considerably reduced after a 16 - h incubation . Phosphorylation of p38 was maximal at 4 h , was maintained until 8 h , and declined abruptly at 16 h . The expression of villin was increased at 1 h and declined thereaf - ter , whereas SOD - 1 was decreased after 1 h , and then rein - creased during 4 – 8 h and then declined markedly at 16 h . The results of Bax expression using anti - Bax antibody showed that the expression level of (cid:7) 18 - kDa band was complementary to that of a 43 - kDa band . The 18 - kDa band was decreased markedly at 8 h and 16 h whereas a 43 - kDa band was increased abruptly at corresponding times . Bax is a proapoptotic protein and exists as a monomer in the cytosol . However , it translo - cates to the mitochondria , where it forms oligomers after an apoptotic stimulus ( 4 ) . Thus these data indicate that an 18 - kDa band is a Bax monomer and a 43 - kDa band is a Bax dimer . Reportedly , the activation of p38 in response to environmental stress and inﬂammatory cytokines can result in apoptosis ( 37 ) . Proapoptotic signals such as Bax dimerization and p38 activa - tion were induced promptly after stimulation by rVacA . At the Fig . 4 . Time course of protein expression in response to s1m1 HSE . A : AGS cells were treated with HSE of ATCC 49503 in a serum - free medium and cells were treated without HSE for 0 h . The time course of phospho - ERK1 / 2 ( pERK ) , SOD - 1 , and villin expression in response to HSE were determined by immunoblotting over an 8 - h period . B : relative densities of phospho - ERK1 / 2 to ERK2 and of SOD - 1 or villin to (cid:5) - tubulin were measured with Image J software .

Cell viability was maintained during 8 h ofincubation with rVacA with sustained phospho - ERK1 / 2 and Bcl2 but the bal - ance was disrupted during 8 – 16 h with Bax dimerization , resulting in cell death . At 16 h , only the expression of Bax dimer was increased while those of others were decreased , which shows Bax dimerization plays critical role for apoptosis induced by rVacA . In addition , activation of p38 MAPK appeared to precede Bax dimerization in rVacA - induced apop - tosis . rVacA induced Bax dimerization in a dose - dependent man - ner . After 4 h treatment with the indicated concentration of rVacA , ERK1 / 2 activation in AGS cells occurred with maxi - mal activation at 5 – 10 (cid:1) g / ml of rVacA . At 20 (cid:1) g / ml , rVacA , however , decreased ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation ( Fig . 6 A , top ) . Bax dimerization by rVacA was increased in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 6 A ) . The addition of anti - VacA antibody attenu - ated the Bax dimerization of 5 – 10 (cid:1) g of rVacA but not higher concentrations of rVacA ( Fig . 6 B ) . On the contrary , as shown in Fig . 2 B , anti - VacA antibody did not inhibit rVacA - induced ERK1 / 2 activation . Effect of NPPB and anti - VacA antibody on VacA - induced phospho - ERK1 / 2 , SOD - 1 , and villin . A nonspeciﬁc chloride channel blocker , NPPB , can inhibit the channel activity of VacA , resulting in a reduction of vacuolation and cytochrome c release caused by VacA ( 14 ) . NPPB suppressed expression of phospho - ERK1 / 2 and villin at 0 . 2 (cid:1) g / ml of VacA and 2 (cid:1) g / ml of rVacA ( Fig . 7 , A and B ) , implying that anionic channel formation of VacA may be associated with ERK1 / 2 activation and villin expression . Although ERK activation by nVacA but not by rVacA was slightly decreased in the presence of anti - VacA antibody , the level of SOD - 1 induced by both nVacA and rVacA was unlikely to change with anti - VacA antibody . The level of villin , however , was signiﬁcantly reduced under the presence of anti - VacA antibody ( Fig . 7 , A and B ) . Cell viability depending on incubation time showed that upon stimulation with 0 . 2 (cid:1) g of VacA cell viability decreased up to 5 h , reincreased up to 10 h , and then decreased thereafter . VacA may induce cell apoptosis followed by cell proliferation to compensate for cell loss wherein SOD - 1 and villin might be involved via ERK1 / 2 activation . Whereas NPPB did not show signiﬁcant effects on cell viability , anti - VacA antibody pro - tected cells from VacA intoxication and lasted by 20 h . rVacA , however , decreased net cell viability in a time - dependent manner and , contrary to Fig . 7 C , NPPB protected moderately but not signiﬁcantly cell from rVacA intoxication . Anti - VacA antibody protected cell from rVacA - induced cell death by 10 h but could not at 20 h . The differences between nVacA and rVacA may be caused by the crudity of nVacA , which might have a proliferating factor . rVacA induces SOD - 1 via ERK activation and phosphory - lation of p38 in AGS . We investigated a possible role of MAP kinases in VacA - induced SOD - 1 and villin expression using MAP kinases inhibitor . After 16 h incubation with rVacA , the expression of SOD - 1 was increased compared with negative control and , however , PD - 98059 inhibited that induction of SOD - 1 , suggesting that the induction by rVacA is via ERK1 / 2 activation ( Fig . 8 A ) . The level of villin remained at 1 (cid:1) g / ml of rVacA and severely suppressed at 2 (cid:1) g / ml rVacA thereafter , irrelevant to treatment of anti - rVacA antibody or PD - 98059 . The activation of p38 by rVacA was in a dose - dependent manner whereas anti - rVacA antibody attenuated the phosphor - ylation of p38 in AGS cells treated with 2 (cid:1) g of rVacA to a similar extent of negative control . Next , the effect of rVacA on cell viability with an MTT assay was assessed . The cytotoxic Fig . 5 . rVacA - induced protein expression in AGS cells in a time - dependent manner . AGS cells were exposed to 10 (cid:1) g / ml of rVacA for the indicated times over a 16 - h period in a serum - free medium , and cells were treated without rVacA for 0 min .

The changes in nu - clear morphology and DNA fragmentation were revealed in a time - dependent manner by DAPI staining . B : histograms represent the percentage of apoptotic cells in AGS cells exposed to rVacA in a time - course experiment . The values represent means and SD determined from 3 areas per specimen .

Data are representative of at least 2 experiments .

Cell viability was decreased in a dose - dependent manner when AGS cells were treated with rVacA in the presence or absence of PD - 98059 ( P (cid:8) 0 . 05 , Kruskal - Wallis test ) . There is , however , almost no effect on cell viability after incubation with rVacA in the presence of anti - rVacA antibody , with only a slight decrease in cell via - bility at higher doses ( 4 (cid:1) g of rVacA ) . PD - 98059 , which totally abrogated ERK1 / 2 activation in the AGS cells , signif - icantly decreased cell viability compared with control , but the rate of cell death at the indicated concentrations of rVacA was similar to that induced by rVacA only . Inhibition of the p38 pathway protects the AGS cells partially from rVacA - induced apoptosis and activates ERK1 / 2 . The involvement of p38 in the VacA - induced apoptosis in AGS cells was conﬁrmed by use of SB - 203580 , a speciﬁc inhibitor of p38 . Although SB - 203580 did not completely inhibit the cytotoxic activity of rVacA , it did protect the cells partially from rVacA - induced apoptosis , which may be at least partially associated with ERK1 / 2 activation in AGS cells treated with the p38 inhibitor ( Fig . 9 , A and B ) . These results imply that there may be a mutual induction between the two pathways : one leading to inhibit and the other to promote apoptosis , especially against rVacA cytotoxicity in AGS cells . Increased SOD - 1 expression was likely to be associated with increased ERK phosphorylation and , in part , decreased p38 phosphorylation in the presence of anti - VacA antibody or SB - 203580 ( Fig . 9 A ) . Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase with SB - 203580 suppresses villin and Bcl2 expression . Despite cytoprotective effect , SB - 203580 was unlikely to prevent VacA - induced Bax dimeriza - tion ( Fig . 10 ) . But a higher level of SB - 203580 ( 60 (cid:1) M ) , partially inhibited rVacA - induced Bax dimerization , implying that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity may not directly lead to the inhibition of VacA - induced Bax activation . Inter - estingly , SB - 203580 inhibited the expression of Bcl2 and villin expression , indicating p38 may play a role in cell proliferation or differentiation for survival upon VacA insult . In accordance with Fig . 9 A , VacA - induced SOD - 1 expression was not inhib - ited by SB - 203580 and furthermore prevented SOD - 1 reduc - tion from the higher dose of rVacA . The results indicate that VacA - induced p38 MAPK activation is not only involved in apoptosis but also involved in survival mechanism . Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase accelerates rVacA - induced apoptosis after exposure to H 2 O 2 . To further conﬁrm the role of MAP kinases in response to ROS induced by rVacA , we investigated the effects of H 2 O 2 , product of SOD enzymatic reaction on rVacA - induced apoptosis in the absence or pres - ence of MAP kinase inhibitor or anti - VacA antibody . SB - 203580 protected AGS cells partially from rVacA - induced apoptosis as shown in Fig . 9 which appeared to be associated with ERK1 / 2 activation and SOD - 1 expression after 16 h incubation . However , it accelerated cell death of AGS cells treated with rVacA for 4 h after exposure to both 50 and 100 (cid:1) M H 2 O 2 for 1 h ( Fig . 11 , B and C ) . On the contrary , PD - 98059 slightly protected cell from rVacA and 100 (cid:1) M of H 2 O 2 intoxication ( Fig . 11 C ) . Therefore , p38 MAP activation may play a critical role in cellular protection in the early stage of response to oxidative stress and conversely , ERK activation promotes oxidative stress - or H 2 O 2 - induced apoptosis in the early stage which may trigger cell proliferation thereafter . Anti - VacA antibody blocks the localization of villin to con - tractile actin ring . Villin expression in response to VacA or rVacA was very versatile but anti - VacA antibody strongly inhibited villin expression , so we identiﬁed the villin expres - sion and localization using an immunoﬂuorescent staining . Villin was mainly observed in contractile actin ring of dividing cells ( Fig . 12 A ) . Contractile actin ring , comprised of non - muscle myosin II and actin ﬁlaments , assembles equatorially at the cell cortex , driving plasma membrane invagination from the cortex ( 2 ) . Villin was identiﬁed in microvilli , microtubes , and near the perinuclear compartment , but the contractile ring was not seen nearly in AGS cells treated with anti - VacA antibody with or without rVacA ( Fig . 12 B ) . DISCUSSION Apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells induced by H . pylori infection is strongly associated with the development of glan - dular atrophy and intestinal metaplasia ( 57 , 58 ) . VacA has been considered as an apoptosis - inducing factor both in vivo and in vitro ( 66 ) . Although the activation of MAP kinases induced by VacA has been demonstrated ( 14 , 18 , 45 ) , the involvement in apoptotic event is not clear . Our results showed that the activation of ERK1 / 2 and p38 by rVacA was link to cell survival and apoptosis , differentially ( 67 , 68 ) . VacA induces clustering and perinuclear redistribution of late endosomes , which requires a functional microtubule cy - toskeleton ( 41 ) . rVacA also reached late endosomes but could Fig . 6 . VacA induced Bax dimerization in dose - dependent manner . A : AGS cells were incubated with indicated concentration of rVacA for 4 h and the cells were lysed in 2 (cid:3) SDS sample buffer .

B : relative densities of Bax dimer to (cid:5) - tubulin after exposure of AGS cells to the indicated concentration of rVacA . The expression level of protein at zero concentration was induced by the ﬁltrate by ﬁltering rVacA through a Microcon YM - 50 ( Millipore ) 50 , 000 - Da cutoff ﬁlter . The indicated concentration of rVacA was prepared by the combination of concentrated rVacA and the ﬁltrate . Data are representative of at least 2 experiments .

After reaching the compartment , rVacA may attack cytoskeleton structure , which may be causes of defective and localizing vacuolation in perinuclear compartment wherein structure collapsed . It could be a cause of reduced villin levels after high - dose ( (cid:2) 2 (cid:1) g / ml ) and / or prolonged exposure to rVacA , leading to induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis . However , rVacA stimulated villin expression at early stages , implying that it may be necessary for inducing vacuolation and morphological change . Villin , an actin - binding protein , is as - sociated with the actin bundles that support microvilli , bundles , caps , and nucleates and sever actin ( 7 , 15 , 55 ) . As shown in Fig . 12 , we have shown that villin is localized in contractile actin ring during late anaphase and disappeared gradually according to completion of cell division wherein it may sever actin ring . Anti - VacA antibody might suppress cell division by inhibiting villin expression , which may be a cause of the abrupt cell death in AGS cells treated with rVacA plus anti - VacA antibody at 20 h ( Fig . 7 B ) . NPPB , an chloride channel blocker , inhibits VacA - induced vacuolation and its internalization ( 30 ) , and its inhibition of villin expression induced by VacA or rVacA may be associated with the decrease in VacA - induced polymerization of actin due to blocking the membrane trafﬁcking ( 29 , 30 ) . Villin is known Fig . 7 . Effect of 5 - nitro - 2 - ( 3 - phenylpropyl - amino ) benzoic acid ( NPPB ) and anti - VacA antibody on VacA - induced protein expres - sion .

Thus more veriﬁcation on the role of VacA in regulating of villin is required . Activation of p38 and accompanying decrease in a phospho - ERK1 / 2 level coincided with an increase in Bax dimer , a decrease in Bcl2 , and apoptosis of AGS cells . rVacA - induced Bax dimerization and its association with apoptosis coincided with the results of Yamasaki et al . ( 70 ) . Inhibition of ERK1 / 2 by PD - 98059 decreased cell viability but was unlikely to potentiate the cytotoxic effect of rVacA . However , ERK1 / 2 activation contributed to sustaining cell survival for a limited time . Although anti - VacA antibody inhibited p38 activation and Bax dimerization induced by rVacA , it was unlikely to inhibit ERK1 / 2 and SOD expression , which may contribute to the ability of the antibody to protect cells from cell death by rVacA intoxication . These results indicated that the effect of VacA on ERK1 / 2 and p38 activation may be differentially regulated , of which only one is dependent on initial membrane binding of VacA , which is inhibited by anti - VacA antibody but is independent of internalization of VacA . Reportedly , EGF receptor , lipid rafts , and receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta have been proposed as VacA receptor , suggesting that VacA may bind to multiple sites on the cell surface ( 49 ) . Therefore , VacA - induced signal transduction may be different depending on the kind of receptor bound . ERK inhibition by PD - 98059 did not aggravate or abolish the cell death induced by rVacA ; however , it did inhibit the induction of SOD - 1 by rVacA as shown in Fig . 8 . Obst et al . ( 47 ) have shown that H . pylori extract directly induces the synthesis of ROS in gastric epithelial cells and causes DNA damage . Induction of SOD - 1 by toxic VacA enriched sample or rVacA implies that VacA may stimulate ROS production , probably from the mitochondria or from MAP kinase activa - tion ( 72 ) . Recent work described how VacA enhances PGE2 production through induction of COX - 2 mRNA in a time - and dose - dependent manner via p38 MAP kinase activation in AZ - 521 cells ( 33 ) , which may induce ROS production . Pro - tection of cells against ROS is accomplished through the activation of oxygen - scavenging enzymes such as SOD , cata - lase , and glutathione peroxidase ( 61 ) . The superoxide anion - scavenging activity of SOD - 1 leads to an increase in H 2 O 2 , which may induce catalase expression . AGS cells treated with rVacA with MAP kinase inhibitors showed that rVacA increased catalase expression moderately , ERK inhibitor decreased the ex - pression slightly , and p38 inhibitor ( SB - 203580 ) did not affect the VacA - induced catalase expression . However , there were no Fig . 9 . Effect of the inhibitor of p38 MAP kinases on SOD - 1 expression and cell viability in AGS cells treated with rVacA . A and B : AGS cells were preincubated with or without indicated inhibitor ( 30 (cid:1) M ) for 30 min and then washed prior to adding 0 – 6 (cid:1) g / ml of rVacA to cells . The cells were incubated for 8 h for protein expression by immunoblotting ( A ) or for 16 h for cell viability by an MTT assay ( B ) . rVacA decreased cell viability in a dose - dependent manner ( ‡ P (cid:8) 0 . 001 vs . nontreated with rVacA , † P (cid:8) 0 . 01 vs . 3 (cid:1) g / ml rVacA treatment , Student’s t - test ) .

Without a con - comitant increase in peroxide - scavenging enzymes , excess H 2 O 2 might be involved in the cell damage caused by VacA . Activation of ERK has been shown to promote or block H 2 O 2 - dependent apoptosis ( 69 , 73 ) . In the present work , H 2 O 2 accelerated rVacA - induced cell death , especially in p38 inhib - itor - pretreated AGS cells , suggesting that p38 MAP kinase plays a pivotal role in protection against H 2 O 2 - induced cell death ( 11 , 27 ) and , conversely , that ERK1 / 2 aggravates H 2 O 2 - induced cell death . Van Laethem et al . ( 64 ) reported that activation of p38 by UVB required for the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria in human keratinocytes . Association of p38 with rVacA - induced apoptosis in our results was based on the effect of SB - 203580 on AGS cells treated with rVacA , resulting in the attenuation of cell death . However , despite the cytoprotective effect of SB - 203580 , inhibition of p38 MAPK activation was unlikely to reduce Bax dimerization induced by rVacA and furthermore led to decrease in Bcl2 and villin expression . Nakayama et al . ( 46 ) reported that VacA activates the p38 signal pathway , which is independent of cytochrome c release from mitochon - dria caused by VacA in AZ - 521 cells . Pleiotropic activity of p38 MAPK such as proliferation , differentiation , and survival upon a stimulus may be explained by the existence of several p38 MAPK isomers with distinct functions ( 3 , 23 , 54 ) . Ac - cording to some literatures , p38 promotes but p38 (cid:5) inhibits apoptosis , and both p38 isomers are suppressed by SB - 203580 ( 35 , 52 , 63 ) . From this , we deduce that SB - 203580 may not only protect cell from cell death via p38 (cid:9) but also suppress host defense mechanisms via p38 (cid:5) in response to VacA intox - ication . Among p38 isomers , p38 (cid:9) has been more abundantly expressed and active than other isoforms ( 32 ) . According to the paper of Abdollahi et al . ( 1 ) , mRNA expression of p38 (cid:9) appears to be constant but p38 (cid:5) to be induced at 16 h and maintained over a 24 - h period without any stress . In the presence of some stress , however , expression of p38 (cid:5) was induced at 8 h , maximal at 16 h and then declined thereafter . Therefore differential activation of p38 (cid:9) and p38 (cid:5) MAP ki - nase coupled with ERK activation may result in various phe - notypic consequences in response to VacA intoxication . Taken together , these results indicated that there is an antagonistic regulation between ERK1 / 2 and p38 on VacA - induced apop - tosis . These antagonistic regulations on taxol - induced apopto - sis and nitric oxide - induced apoptosis have been described ( 38 , 60 ) . Thus the roles of ERK and p38 MAPKs in apoptosis or proliferation might be dependent on cell type and state ( 19 ) . In addition , Ranganathan et al . ( 53 ) demonstrated that Mn - SOD dependent H 2 O 2 production leads to the activation of the ERK1 / 2 signaling and subsequent downstream transcriptional Fig . 11 . Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase accelerates rVacA - induced apoptosis after exposure to H 2 O 2 . Cell viability was assessed by an MTT assay in AGS cells treated with 0 – 4 (cid:1) g / ml of rVacA fo r 4 h ( A ) or followed by exposure to 50 ( B ) or 100 (cid:1) M H 2 O 2 ( C ) for 1 h .

Therefore , it is likely that VacA - induced ROS stimulates ERK1 / 2 - dependent SOD - 1 expression by which H 2 O 2 production might lead to another ERK1 / 2 activation and subsequent downstream transcriptional in - creases in MMP expression , which may be involved in actin cytoskeleton degradation , leading to apoptosis . A recent report by Pillinger et al . ( 50 ) suggests that H . pylori - induced MMP - 1 secretion can be both dependent on and independent of CagA and is regulated positively via ERK and negatively via p38 MAPK . Thus the association of VacA with MMP - 1 secretion needs further investigation . Apoptosis in gastric epithelium by H . pylori infection and ROS production have been associated with the incidence of gastric cancer . Moreover , Lin et al . ( 42 ) reported in a case - control study that higher SOD - 1 levels may be associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer . H . pylori - associated gastri - tis is predominant in the antrum , where a signiﬁcant increase of the SOD activity has been detected ( 24 , 25 ) . Malignant cells produce active superoxide , which makes the cancer cell highly dependent on SOD for survival and thus more sensitive to inhibition of SOD ; hence Huang et al . ( 34 ) suggested that targeting SOD may be a promising approach to the selective killing of cancer cells . In summary , we ﬁrst demonstrated that VacA stimulates expression of SOD - 1 via ERK1 / 2 activation and the expression and degradation of villin using recombinant VacA . These results suggest that SOD - 1 and villin are expressed differen - tially upon VacA insult depending on dose and exposure time via ERK and p38 MAP kinases ; decrease in SOD - 1 and villin expression coupled with Bax dimerization leads to apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells . Therefore , VacA may be a crucial factor of gastric cancer development in subjects with chronic H . pylori infection by a repeated stimulation of cellular prolifer - ation and apoptosis mediated by a ﬁne - tuned control between ERK and p38 MAP kinase .
