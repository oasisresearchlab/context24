C . p . A . , Trieste , Italy , 3 Institute of Materials – National Research Council , Trieste , Italy Small RhoGTPases , such as Cdc42 and RhoA , are key players in integrating external cues and intracellular signaling pathways that regulate growth cone ( GC ) motility . Indeed , Cdc42 is involved in actin polymerization and ﬁlopodia formation , whereas RhoA induces GC collapse and neurite retraction through actomyosin contraction . In this study we employed Förster Resonance Energy Transfer ( FRET ) microscopy to study the spatio - temporal dynamics of Cdc42 and RhoA in GCs in response to local Semaphorin - 3A ( Sema3A ) stimulation obtained with lipid vesicles ﬁlled with Sema3A and positioned near the selected GC using optical tweezers . We found that Cdc42 and RhoA were activated at the leading edge of NG108 - 15 neuroblastoma cells during spontaneous cycles of protrusion and retraction , respectively . The release of Sema3A brought to a progressive activation of RhoA within 30 s from the stimulus in the central region of the GC that collapsed and retracted . In contrast , the same stimulation evoked waves of Cdc42 activation propagating away from the stimulated region . A more localized stimulation obtained with Sema3A coated beads placed on the GC , led to Cdc42 active waves that propagated in a retrograde manner with a mean period of 70 s , and followed by GC retraction . Therefore , Sema3A activates both Cdc42 and RhoA with a complex and different spatial - temporal dynamics . Keywords : RhoA , Cdc42 , FRET , local stimulation , Semaphorin - 3A , GC retraction , NG108 - 15 cell line Introduction Axon outgrowth and guidance depend on the ability of growth cones ( GCs ) to detect molecular guidance cues in their extracellular environment and to respond with a dynamic remodeling of the cytoskeleton . It is well - established that repulsive GCs turning arises from the disruption and loss of F - actin superstructures and actomyosin contraction , while attractive GC turning entails asymmetrical incorporation of actin on the side of the GC close to the chemoattractant ( Dent et al . , 2011 ) . The Rho protein family members of small GTPases act as molecular switches to control signal transduction pathways by cycling between a GDP - bound , inactive form , and a GTP - bound , active form ( Raftopoulou and Hall , 2004 ) . In their active state , they have a key role in the cytoskeleton reorganization as they act downstream of most guidance cue receptors ( Hall , 1998 ; Luo , 2000 ; Dickson , 2001 ; Jaﬀe and Hall , 2005 ) . In neurons , the Rho family members RhoA and Cdc42 regulate GC extension and axon outgrowth : RhoA triggers actin cytoskeleton rearrangement to support GC collapse and neurite retraction ( Thies and Davenport , 2003 ; Wu et al . , 2005 ) , Iseppon et al . Cdc42 - RhoA dynamics upon local Sema - 3A stimulation whereas Cdc42 promotes neurite outgrowth and GC ﬁlopodia formation ( Ahmed et al . , 2006 ; Hall and Lalli , 2010 ) . However , the activation of the RhoA pathway has growth - promoting eﬀects in cortical and hippocampal cell axons ( Ahnert - Hilger et al . , 2004 ; Ohnami et al . , 2008 ) . The secreted guidance cue is Semaphorin - 3A ( Sema3A ) , a repulsive guidance molecule that generally causes GC collapse in neurons through microtubule and actin reorganization ( Fan and Raper , 1995 ; Goshima et al . , 2002 ; Tran et al . , 2007 ; Zhou et al . , 2008 ) , helping steer both axons and migrating cells along the correct trajectory . Sema3A is thought to act as a dimer ( Wong et al . , 1999 ) binding to the complex of receptors neuropilin1 / plexinA1 , to initiate signal transduction pathways ( Adams et al . , 1997 ; Takahashi et al . , 1997 ) . Intracellular signaling of Sema3A has been extensively studied , also quite recently ( Jongbloets and Pasterkamp , 2014 ; Worzfeld and Oﬀermanns , 2014 ) . In DRG neurons , Sema3A stimulation induces GC collapse of sensory neurons through RhoA eﬀector ROCK and intra - axonal translation of RhoA mRNA , which , through an axonal 3 ′ UTR targeting element , is localized in developing axons and GCs ( Wu et al . , 2005 ; Hengst et al . , 2006 ) . This local translation is a condition necessary and suﬃcient to allow Sema3A - mediated GC collapse . In contrast , the role of Cdc42 in Sema3A collapse response is still unclear with reported contradictory results ( Jin and Strittmatter , 1997 ; Kuhn et al . , 1999 ) . Bath application of Sema3A has several drawbacks : the entire neuron is exposed to Sema3A and the response could involve both the entire neuron and the GC ( Brown et al . , 2009 ) . In the present study , we combined the sensitized emission Förster Resonance Energy Transfer ( FRET ) technique with local stimulation to observe the spatial and temporal activation of RhoA and Cdc42 following localized stimulation with Sema3A . We used two types of vectors for local delivery of molecules : microbeads and micro - sized lipid vesicles . Silica microbeads have been covalently functionalized on their surface with Sema3A and placed on the GC of interest with a sub - micrometric precision , allowing a more localized stimulation for 30 s . Thus , Sema3A beads were able to induce a localized response to Sema3A , although the guidance molecule was not in its native form . We then used lipid vesicles encapsulating Sema3A that were trapped with optical tweezers in front of the exploring GC and broken with short UV laser pulse . In this way we studied the delivery of Sema3A in its native form but with a less precise spatial localization of its delivery . In this paper , we examine the role of RhoA and Cdc42 in NG108 - 15 neuroblastoma cells and we show that they are both involved in Sema3A morphological changes with speciﬁc spatio - temporal dynamics ; we also show that Cdc42 ( but not RhoA ) exhibits a complex wave behavior . Although the existence of diﬀerent models that prove both a crosstalk and a negative feedback between the Rho GTPases ( Holmes et al . , 2012 ; Marèe et al . , 2012 ) is conﬁrmed , our data support a more dynamic pattern for Cdc42 that reﬂects a higher degree of complexity for the Rho GTPase signaling . Materials and Methods Cell Cultures and Transfection NG108 - 15 neuroblastoma cells were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Invitrogen ) , 100 µ g / ml streptomycin and 100 units / ml in penicillin in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere at 37 ◦ C . For live cell imaging studies , cells were seeded on glass coverslips , coated for 3 h with laminin ( 50 µ g / ml , L2020 Sigma ) in 12 - multiwell plates . Cells were transfected 24 h later with intermolecular RhoA / Cdc42 FRET sensors ( Murakoshi et al . , 2011 ) using Metafectene reagent ( Biontex Laboratories ) following the manufacturer’s protocol and imaged 1 day after transfection . mEGFP - RhoA - C1 ( Addgene plasmid # 29674 ) , mEGFP - Cdc42 - C1 ( Addgene plasmid # 29673 ) , mCherry - Rhotekin ( 8 – 89 ) - mCherry - C1 ( Addgene plasmid # 29675 ) and mCherry - Pak3 ( 60 – 113 ) / S74A / F84A - mCherry - C1 ( Addgene plasmid # 29676 ) were a gift from Ryohei Yasuda ( Murakoshi et al . , 2011 ) . Immunoﬂuorescence All these steps were performed at room temperature ( 20 – 22 ◦ C ) and coverslips were rinsed with phosphate - buﬀered saline ( PBS ) between each step . Cells were ﬁxed in freshly prepared 4 % paraformaldehyde containing 0 . 15 % picric acid in PBS , permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 10 min and blocked with 0 . 5 % BSA ( all from Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) in PBS for 1 h . Cells were then incubated with primary goat polyclonal antibody against neuropilin1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against plexinA1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) for 1 h . The secondary antibodies were donkey anti - rabbit 488 and donkey anti - goat 594 Alexa ( Invitrogen , Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD , USA ) and the incubation time was 30 min . Nuclei were stained with 2 µ g / ml Hoechst 33342 ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) in PBS for 5 min . Coverslips were inverted and mounted on the glass side using Vectashield Mounting Medium and were then examined on a Leica DM6000 microscope ( Leica Microsystems GmbH , Germany ) using a 100 × magniﬁcation and 1 . 42 NA oil - immersion objective . Fluorescent images were processed using Leica LCS Lite and Image J by W . Rasband ( developed at the U . S . National Institutes of Health and available at http : / / rsbweb . nih . gov / ij / ) . For the colocalization analysis , each image was captured applying the same exposure and gain settings per channel and using Volocity 5 . 4 3D imaging software ( PerkinElmer , Coventry , UK ) . Vesicle Preparation Detailed experimental procedures are described in our companion papers ( Pinato et al . , 2011 , 2012 ) . Single vesicles , with a diameter of 1 – 5 µ m , were obtained with the lipid ﬁlm hydration method using a hydration solution containing BSA or Sema3A , and were then identiﬁed , trapped and positioned at the location of interest ( Ichikawa and Yoshikawa , 2001 ) . Beads Functionalization and Immunohistochemistry 1 . 5 µ m large silica beads coated with COOH groups ( Kisker - biotech , cat . PSi - 1 . 5COOH ) were functionalized using PolyLink Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 2 August 2015 | Volume 9 | Article 333 Iseppon et al . Cdc42 - RhoA dynamics upon local Sema - 3A stimulation Protein Coupling Kit ( Bangs Laboratories Inc . , cat . PL01N ) , following the manufacturers protocol . Brieﬂy , about 1 . 4 × 10 5 beads were incubated with 500 ng of Sema3A , in the presence of 20 µ g / µ L EDAC for 1 h , at room temperature and stored in Storage Buﬀer at 4 ◦ C . Coated and un - coated microspheres were washed in PBS and incubated for 1 h , at room temperature , with anti - Sema3A ( 1 : 50 , Sigma ) . Beads were then centrifuged , washed and incubated for 30 min , at room temperature , with donkey anti - goat Alexa 594 ( Invitrogen ) and ﬁnally analyzed using Fluorescence Microscopy ( Nikon Eclipse TE - 2000 - E ) . Optical Manipulation and FRET Microscopy Setup Local delivery was achieved by optical trapping and manipulation of single vesicles at a speciﬁc position nearby the cells , followed by vesicles photolysis , to release active molecules . To increase the localization of the stimulus , single beads were optically trapped and maintained in contact with the GCs for 30 s . RhoGTPases activation was monitored by FRET microscopy . The setup , depicted in Figure 1 , was developed around an inverted microscope ( Nikon Eclipse TE - 2000 - E ) adding three modules : ( 1 ) Infrared ( IR ) laser tweezers ( custom built ) ; ( 2 ) Ultraviolet ( UV ) laser micro - dissection system ( MMI - CellCut Plus , MMI , Zurich , Switzerland ) ; ( 3 ) Image splitter ( OptoSplit II LS , Cairn Research , UK ) . The ﬁrst two modules are described in detail in our companion papers ( Pinato et al . , 2011 , 2012 ) . The trapping laser beam , generated by a 1064 nm ﬁber laser , is aligned with the micro - dissection UV beam and then focused on the sample through the same lens ( Nikon , 60X water immersion , numerical aperture NA - 1 . 2 ) . The ﬂuorescence path includes a 100 W Hg FIGURE 1 | Optical manipulation and FRET imaging setup . The IR laser beam ( 1064nm ) is aligned to the UV laser micro - dissection beam ( 355nm ) and then both are directed into the pupil of the microscope objective ( 60X - 1 . 2 NA ) . The sample is illuminated both by a white light source and a Hg ﬂuorescence lamp . The light coming from the Donor and the Acceptor ﬂuorophores in the sample is separated by a dual emission image splitter and the two images are formed on the two halves of the sCMOS camera sensor . Lamp , excitation ﬁlters for EGFP ( 445 / 30 nm , Chroma , USA ) and mCherry ( 550 / 30 nm ) . Light emitted by the sample is directed to the image splitter , where a dichroic mirror ( 585 nm ) splits the light into Donor ( EGFP ) and Acceptor ( mCherry ) channels . After passing through the emission ﬁlters ( EGFP : 515 / 30 nm ; mCherry : 625 / 30 nm ) each of the two beams is imaged on one of the two halves of a sCMOS sensor ( Orca Flash 4 . 0 , Hamamatsu ) , thus allowing the acquisition of the donor and of FRET emissions simultaneously . All live cells and FRET microscopy experiments were performed on the setup previously described . Imaging was performed in a Ringer’s Solution and during the experiments cells were kept at 37 ◦ C , using a temperature controller ( TempControl 37 - 2 , PeCon , Germany ) . Experiments with the same coverslip always lasted less than 60 min . For bath applied stimulation assays time - lapse DIC images were acquired every 500 ms with a Nikon , 20X ( NA : 0 . 25 ) objective in case of population studies , and with a Nikon , 60X ( NA : 1 . 2 ) objective in case of single cell studies , from 90 s before adding the Sema3A to 20 min after it . For local stimulation assays , we trapped the lipid vesicle or the bead with the optical tweezers and we positioned it in front of , or in contact with , the selected GC . We then acquired simultaneously the Donor and Acceptor ( FRET ) channels for 15 min after the vesicle photolysis . All acquisitions were done with the sCMOS sensor at 16 - bit depth . The exposure time for the FRET channels acquisition was 1 s at binning 4 × 4 . Ratiometric Corrections and Image Analysis Ratiometric corrections and ratio calculations to generate activity images were performed using the Biosensors 2 . 1 MATLAB package ( Danuser laboratory : http : / / lccb . hms . harvard . edu / software . html ) . All images were sequentially shading - corrected and background - subtracted ; an optional photobleaching correction was also applied . Binary masks , with values equal to 1 inside the cells and 0 elsewhere , were extracted by thresholding the EGFP image ( since it presented the highest signal - to - noise ratio ) . Control cells expressing either EGFP alone or mCherry alone were used to obtain bleedthrough coeﬃcients necessary for the correction of the FRET image . The ﬁnal ratio image , obtained dividing the completely corrected FRET image by the EGFP image , was used as a measure for the RhoA and Cdc42 activity . Further image analysis was performed by ImageJ and custom - built codes were written in Matlab ( Mathworks ) . To describe RhoA and Cdc42 activation , rectangular areas ( size 10 × 20 µ m ) were generated selecting regions of interest in the normal direction with respect to the edge dynamics of the GCs ; montage images were then composed by taking one image every 60 or 120 s for the entire duration of the experiment . The quantiﬁcation of the FRET ratio was performed in stalling , protruding and retracting regions of the cell edge , and the results were normalized by the mean intensity of the ratio in the stalling regions . To measure the temporal dynamics of RhoA and Cdc42 , a square area of 4 µ m 2 was selected in the region of interest previously considered for image montages , so that no movement of the edge could interfere with the measurements ; the intensity was calculated for every time point and then the measurements were normalized using the following equation : Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 3 August 2015 | Volume 9 | Article 333 Iseppon et al . Cdc42 - RhoA dynamics upon local Sema - 3A stimulation 1 F = F − F 0 F 0 , where F is the intensity at the time point t and F 0 is the intensity at the ﬁrst frame . Cell edges were detected for each frame by intensity - thresholding of the Ratio ﬁnal image and edge dynamics were calculated along the central line of the rectangles , previously considered for the image montages . Edge and RhoGTPases activation dynamics were then plotted together in a graph , as a function of time . To measure the period of the waves in the diﬀerent cases , one or more areas were selected in the retracting GCs , as previously described for temporal dynamics measurements , and then the wave period was calculated extrapolating the time between two maxima from the intensity vs . time plots . Statistical Analysis All quantitative results have been obtained from at least three independent experiments and expressed as the mean ± SEM . Experimental data were analyzed by Student’s t - test and One - Way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) . Diﬀerences among samples were considered statistically signiﬁcant when p < 0 . 05 . Results The Spontaneous Dynamics of RhoA and Cdc42 in NG108 - 15 Cell Line NG108 - 15 neuroblastoma cells are a good model system for neuronal signaling and growth ( Smalheiser , 1991a , b ; Goshima et al . , 1993 ; Tsuji et al . , 2011 ) . In the absence of adherent or diﬀusive signaling gradients , NG108 - 15 cells exhibit both a complete collapse of the GC followed by a full or partial retraction of the neurite and the transient collapse of the GC structures ( Rauch et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , to measure the spontaneous activity of RhoA and Ccd42 in GCs , we transiently overexpressed in NG108 - 15 cells the intermolecular RhoA / Cdc42 probes based on FRET ( Murakoshi et al . , 2011 ) . These probes consist of two components : wild type RhoA / Cdc42 tagged with monomeric enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein ( mEGFP ) and their binding partner , Rho GTPase binding domain ( RBD ) of Rhotekin / Pak3 , doubly tagged with mCherry ( mCherry - RBD - mCherry ) ( Murakoshi et al . , 2011 ) . The expression of the intermolecular RhoA / Cdc42 probes was carefully titrated to levels that did not alter the normal neurite outgrowth . GFP , mCherry and FRET images were captured 18 - 20 h post - transfection using a Dual - view image splitting device . After background and spectral bleed - through correction , the GFP / mCherry ratio was measured and correlated with the activation levels of RhoA and Cdc42 during spontaneous protrusion and retraction events . NG108 - 15 neuroblastoma cell line shows neurite outgrowth when plated on glass slides that have been coated with laminin . To examine the eﬀect of RhoA and Cdc42 transfection on NG108 - 15 cells , we compared the morphologies of cells transfected with either RhoA or Cdc42 ( Figures S1A , B ) . Transfection of Cdc42 induced signiﬁcant neurite outgrowth compared with RhoA transfected cells that appeared more ﬂatted ( Figures S1A – D ) . Furthermore , most of the Cdc42 - transfected cells were polarized with long neurite - like processes that were generally branched and exhibited micro - spikes along their length ( Figures S1B – D ) . In RhoA transfected cells , we observed that elevated RhoA activity ( Figures 2A , B ; mean FRET ratio : 1 . 109 ) correlates with edge retraction , whereas reduced RhoA activity ( Figures 2A , B ; mean FRET ratio : 0 . 831 ) leads to edge protrusion . To investigate how spontaneous RhoA activity relates to edge dynamics , we scanned RhoA activity in both protrusion ( Figures 2C , D ) and retraction regions ( Figures 2C , E ) of one representative cell at 60 s intervals . This conﬁrmed that edge retraction coincides with a boost in RhoA activity compared with a protrusion event . Cdc42 activity has been implicated in the regulation of ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia extension in many cell types ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ; Peng et al . , 2003 ; Nalbant et al . , 2004 ; Myers et al . , 2012 ) . We then imaged Cdc42 transfected cells and we found that membrane - ruﬄing and ﬁlopodia extension strongly correlate with hot spots of Cdc42 activity ( Figure 3B ; mean FRET ratio of 1 . 061 ) with respect to cell edges without protrusions FIGURE 2 | Spontaneous RhoA dynamics in NG108 - 15 cells .

Intensity scale on the right in ( D ) applies to ( A , C , D ) . ( Figure 3B ; mean FRET ratio of 0 . 938 ) ( Figure 3 ) . Therefore , these ﬁndings indicate that a selective activation of RhoA and Cdc42 correlates spatially and temporally with retraction and extension events in NG108 - 15 cell line . Sema3A Induces GC Retraction in NG108 - 15 Cell Line In order to study the NG108 - 15 behavior after Sema3A stimulation , we ﬁrst observed the distribution of Sema3A receptors neuropilin1 and plexinA1 using immunoﬂuorescence microscopy after double staining with antibodies against neuripilin1 and plexinA1 : both the Sema3A receptors were found in GCs of NG108 - 15 cell line ( Figure S1E ) . This observation was consistent with the distribution of neuropilin1 and plexinA1 shown for hippocampal neurons ( Pinato et al . , 2012 ) . Since bath application of Sema3A could have several drawbacks ( Brown et al . , 2009 ) , we examined the eﬀect of local stimulation with Sema3A ﬁlled lipid vesicles on GC in NG108 - 15 cells . We had previously demonstrated that local stimulation with vesicles encapsulating guidance molecules can allow a controlled spatiotemporal stimulation of hippocampal neurons that mimics better the natural behavior of the guidance molecules themselves ( Pinato et al . , 2012 ) . Lipid vesicles , with a diameter varying between 1 and 5 µ m , were encapsulated with 10 3 – 10 4 molecules of Sema3A ( Pinato et al . , 2011 , 2012 ) . Local stimulation with lipid vesicles encapsulating Sema3A led to a rapid collapse and retraction of the GC ( Figures 4A , C ) : retraction was already detectable at 100 s after stimulation with Sema3A and reached a plateau between 5 and 6 min . After local stimulation with BSA , no comparable retraction was observed ( Figures 4B , D ) . Local Stimulation by Sema3A Induces RhoA Activation Followed By the GC Retraction To investigate the spatio - temporal activation of RhoA after local stimulation with Sema3A , we combined FRET with optical tweezers set - up to induce the local delivery of vesicles encapsulating Sema3A ( Figure 1 - see Methods section ) . Local application of Sema3A leads to an increase of RhoA activity in the FIGURE 4 | GC behavior of NG108 - 15 cells stimulated with Sema3A . ( A , B ) DIC images of a representative cell locally stimulated with lipid vesicles encapsulating 1 µ M of Sema3A at 0 ( A ) and 900s ( B ) from the delivery . The red and green lines represent respectively the initial and ﬁnal GC proﬁle . The pink cross with the arrow represents the position of the liposome . ( C , D ) The same as in ( A , B ) , but the representative cell is locally stimulated with lipid vesicles encapsulating 1 µ M of BSA . Frames were taken every second for 15min in both cases . Contrast and brightness enhancement were applied to all images , followed by bandpass ﬁltering of the spatial frequencies to enhance the edge contrast . central region of the GC followed by GC collapse and retraction ( Figure 5A and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . Ratiometric FRET imaging highlighted that RhoA activity increases rapidly , within 30 s after Sema3A local stimulation , reaching the maximum value within 400 s ( Figures 5B , C ) . A more detailed analysis of the time dependence of RhoA activity and GC edge retraction showed that the GC begins to retract within 100 – 120 s after Sema3A local stimulation , reaching a complete collapse and retraction within 15 min ( Figure 5D ; data from ﬁve experiments ) . The delay between the increase of RhoA activity and the GC retraction can be explained with the recruitment of RhoA binding proteins necessary for cytoskeletal rearrangement .

RhoA dynamics was followed for 15min after Sema3A stimulation . FRET ratio is represented as a blue line ; edge retraction is deﬁned as a red line . Data are shown as Mean ± SEM . BSA ( Figures S2A – C ) , no comparable retraction ( Figure 2 ) was observed . Thus , our results strongly suggest that Sema3A local stimulation leads to an activation of RhoA associated to GC collapse and retraction . Cdc42 Activation Exhibits a Wave - like Behavior We then determined the spatial and temporal dynamics of activated Cdc42 in response to Sema3A local delivery ( Supplementary Movie 2 ) . Ratiometric FRET imaging showed that Cdc42 activity decreases within 60 s from Sema3A stimulation almost in synchrony with the cell edge retraction ( Figures 6A , B , D , E and Figure S3 ; data from seven experiments ) . In 43 % of cases , we observed that in the region far from the stimulus Cdc42 activity increases within 120 s after Sema3A stimulation followed by edge advancement , lamellipodia ruﬄing and ﬁlopodia extension ( Figures 6A – C , F ) . Plotting Cdc42 activity against time showed waves of active Cdc42 between the front and back of the protruding region , with a mean period of 155 ± 9 s ( Figures 7C , E ; data from three experiments ) . The delay between Cdc42 activation and Sema3A stimulation indicates that the protrusion event in the region far from the local release of Sema3A is a reaction to the repulsive stimulus . Consistently , BSA local stimulation seemed not to aﬀect the activity of Cdc42 in transfected cells ( Figures S2D – F ) . In order to better characterize Cdc42 activity in response to Sema3A local stimulation , we used 1 . 5 µ m microbeads coated with Sema3A that allow a more localized stimulation ( D’Este et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure S4 ) . Live FRET imaging of GCs transfected with Cdc42 and stimulated with Sema3A - beads showed the appearance of recurring waves of active Cdc42 almost in synchrony with the retraction of the GC ( Figure 7A ) . Plotting Cdc42 intensity against time from three diﬀerent areas of the stimulated GC revealed a burst of Cdc42 activity within 100 – 120 s from the local stimulation and highlighted the propagation of Cdc42 traveling waves from the front to the back of the retracting GC ( Figure 7B ) . In spontaneous GC collapse and retraction we observed again Cdc42 active waves , but with a diﬀerent periodicity ( Beads : 70 ± 5 s vs . Spontaneous : 110 ± 10 s ) ( Figures 7D , E ) . Indeed , we found that Cdc42 active waves have diﬀerent periods in all three cases described herein ( Lipid vesicles , Spontaneous , and Coated Beads ) reﬂecting the diﬀerent cellular behavior in response to the stimulus applied ( Holmes et al . , 2012 ; Marèe et al . , 2012 ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings show that ( a ) Cdc42 has a traveling wave behavior with a diﬀerent periodicity , highlighting Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 6 August 2015 | Volume 9 | Article 333 Iseppon et al .

Discussion By combining FRET with local stimulation we have demonstrated that local delivery of Sema3A induces an activation of RhoA followed by a rapid GC retraction . The use of two diﬀerent approaches ( beads and liposome vesicles ) for Sema3A local stimulation of Cdc42 transfected cells , both based on optical manipulation , led to a better characterization of Cdc42 wave behavior . Sema3A release from the vesicles induced a decrease in Cdc42 activity followed by an edge retraction . In regions distant from the stimulus , active waves of Cdc42 resulted in a marked increase in cell dynamic with lamellipodia - ruﬄing and ﬁlopodia extension . Using 1 . 5 - µ m diameter Sema3A - immobilized microbeads , we observed again Cdc42 active waves that here resulted in GC retraction . In previous papers ( Pinato et al . , 2011 , 2012 ) , the local delivery was used to estimate the minimum number of Sema3A and Netrin1 molecules necessary to induce retraction and growth , respectively . The present study expands previous observations by combining for the ﬁrst time local stimulation with the FRET technique underlying a ﬁne spatial and temporal regulation of RhoGTPase activities after Sema3A stimulus . RhoA and Cdc42 Have a Different Spontaneous Activity in NG108 - 15 Neuroblastoma Cells Rho GTPases are key molecular switches that aﬀect multiple cellular functions including cell migration and polarity , vesicle traﬃcking , cytokinesis and endocytosis ( Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2002 ; Govek et al . , 2005 ; Boureux et al . , 2007 ; Haesman and Ridley , 2008 ; Pertz , 2010 ) . They are important players in the transmission and integration of signals that control the cytoskeleton : in response to extracellular signals , they induce changes in the organization of actin cytoskeleton to allow diﬀerent biological processes like morphogenesis , chemotaxis , axonal guidance , and cell cycle progression ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ; Gallo and Letourneau , 2004 ; Sit and Manser , 2011 ; Gomez and Letourneau , 2014 ) . In N1E - 115 neuroblastoma cell line , Cdc42 promotes the formation of ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia , whereas RhoA causes GC collapse and neurite retraction ( Kozma et al . , 1997 ; van Leeuwen et al . , 1997 ; Sarner et al . , 1997 ) .

Scalebars in ( A , C , D ) : 10 µ m . substrate , NG108 - 15 cells expressing Cdc42 exhibited long processes with rather simple GCs and branched neurites with several actin microspikes along their length . On the contrary , expression of RhoA often resulted in cell rounding and ﬂattening without the appearance of stress ﬁbers or focal contact ( Figure S1 ) . Spatial and temporal monitoring of spontaneous activity of RhoA and Cdc42 in NG108 - 15 cells allowed us to directly compare cell motility with levels of active RhoA and Cdc42 . We found that ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia protrusions correlate with Cdc42 activation in these subcellular domains ( Figure 3 ) , whereas RhoA activity increases and decreases in synchrony with cell leading edge retraction and protrusion ( Figure 2 ) . Local Release of Sema3A Induces a Rapid GC Collapse and Retraction The role of Rho - family GTPases in response to several guidance cue stimulations has been extensively studied in order to address their role in F - actin dynamics and organization that determine axon guidance , GC behavior and axon extension ( Gallo and Letourneau , 2004 ) . Attractive cues such as brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) activate Cdc42 and Rac ( Yuan et al . , 2003 ; Cheung et al . , 2007 ; Myers et al . , 2012 ; Tep et al . , 2012 ) , whereas repulsive cues like Slit or Eph / ephrin have been shown to induce a reduction of Cdc42 activity at GC periphery and an activation of RhoA / ROCK pathway respectively ( Wahl et al . , 2000 ; Myers et al . , 2012 ; Takeuchi et al . , 2015 ) . However , it is well - established that small GTPases are important components of Semaphorin ( Sema ) / plexin axon guidance signaling ( Kruger et al . , 2005 ; Tran et al . , 2007 ) . The Sema family of secreted , transmembrane and GPI - linked proteins is one of the largest families of axon guidance cues and guides the growing axons by repelling them or preventing them from entering certain regions ( Yazdani and Terman , 2006 ) . The prototypic member of this family is the diﬀusible repulsive guidance cue Sema3A that induces collapse of GCs through the interaction with its receptor plexinA1 ( Fan and Raper , 1995 ; Nakamura et al . , 2000 ; Brown and Bridgman , 2009 ) . In our experiments , Sema3A local delivery leads to a rapid GC collapse and retraction in NG108 - 15 neuroblastoma cell line ( Figure 4 ) in agreement with similar experiments in DRG neurons ( Brown et al . , 2009 ) . Sema3A Local Stimulation Activates RhoA and Cdc42 with Speciﬁc Spatio - temporal Dynamics Previous ﬁndings have indicated an inhibitory role for RhoA in inducing neurite extension ( Kozma et al . , 1997 ; Dickson , 2001 ; Wu et al . , 2005 ) . Consistently , we found that Sema3A local release leads to RhoA activation within 30 s , causing a delayed GC retraction ( 100 – 120 s from stimulation ) with a correlation between the levels of RhoA activity and Sema3A - induced morphological changes ( Figure 5 ) . This delay suggests that GC collapse and Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 8 August 2015 | Volume 9 | Article 333 Iseppon et al . Cdc42 - RhoA dynamics upon local Sema - 3A stimulation retraction could require RhoA recruitment of its binding partners . In Cdc42 transfected cells , local delivery of Sema3A caused a decrease of Cdc42 activity within 60 s from the stimulation ( Figure 6 ) . Cdc42 showed a wave behavior with a retrograde ﬂow that proceeded almost in synchrony with cell retraction toward the repulsive cue ( Figure 6 ) . In a few cases , Sema3A local release induced the formation of active Cdc42 propagating waves away from Sema3A stimulation that generated new lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia suggesting a role for Cdc42 as an important component of actin t - waves ( Lim et al . , 2008 ; Flynn et al . , 2009 ; Mori et al . , 2011 ; Allard and Mogilner , 2013 ) ( Figure 6 ) . Local stimulation with Sema3A coated beads induced the formation of active Cdc42 waves that propagated from the edge of the GC to the center of the cell with a period of 70 s ( Figure 7 ) . The same active Cdc42 waves were found in spontaneous GC collapse and retraction in response to repellent signals naturally occurring in neuronal cell culture , but with a mean period of 110 s ( Rauch et al . , 2013 ) . How diﬀerently Sema3A stimulation can inﬂuence Cdc42 wave behavior is still an open question . One possibility is that these diﬀerent Cdc42 dynamic wave patterns reﬂect the heterogeneity of the cell population or diﬀerential activity states of the cell . Alternatively , bead mechanical stimulation could induce calcium oscillations within the cell that inﬂuence actin t - waves through the modulation of Cdc42 activity ( Wu et al . , 2013 ) . Although previous models have highlighted a ﬁne spatio - temporal crosstalk between Rho GTPases that exhibit sustained polarization by a wave - pinning mechanism ( Mori et al . , 2008 ; Holmes et al . , 2012 ; Marèe et al . , 2012 ) , our data show a wave - propagation mechanism for Cdc42 but not for RhoA and provide clear evidence for a higher degree of complexity in Rho GTPase signaling network ( Pertz , 2010 ) . Our ﬁndings clearly indicate that the combination of the FRET technique with local stimulation provides new tools for the study of cytoskeleton rearrangements in response to guidance cue stimulations , highlighting the dynamic spatial and temporal regulation of Rho GTPases .
