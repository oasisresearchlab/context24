1 The Missing Science : Epidemiological data gaps for COVID - 19 policy in the United States Rajiv Bhatia 1 * , Isabella Sledge , Stefan Baral 2 1 Primary Care and Population Health , Stanford University , Stanford , CA 2 Department of Epidemiology , Johns Hopkins School of Public Health , Baltimore , MD * Corresponding author : drajiv @ stanford . edu Abstract We report on a scoping study of COVID - 19 epidemiological data available for COVID - 19 policy and management decisions for U . S . settings . We synthesize current US Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention ( CDC ) estimates for parameter of infectious transmission , infection severity , and disease burden , and summarize epidemiologic contributions to these parameters published by CDC - affiliated investigators through Oct 30 , 2020 . Authoritative estimates of most infectious transmission and infection severity parameters exist but rely primarily on data from studies conducted in non - U . S . populations . Estimates of secondary infection risks for household , workplace , school , or other community settings are lacking and estimates of the clinical fraction remain uncertain . The CDC reports multiple disease incidence and prevalence measures at national and state geographies , including some measures disaggregated by age group , race / ethnicity and sex ; however , nationally uniform disease burden measures are not available at the sub - state level or for sub - populations defined by exposure setting , limiting opportunities for targeted interventions . CDC - affiliated investigators authored 133 quantitative studies on COVID - 19 through Oct 30 , 2020 ; however only 34 employed analytic methods . The remainder were descriptive . Of the 34 analytic studies , eleven reported on risk factors for infection , seven reported on risk factors for severe disease , three on symptomatic infections , three reported secondary infection risks , and four reported on indirect pandemic effects . Gaps remain in the epidemiological data required .

The scope and severity of the US COVID - 19 epidemic and its enormous social costs makes the need for actionable epidemiologic data particularly acute . Yet , one year after the discovery of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus , the US Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) acknowledges that “information about the biological aspects of SARS - CoV - 2 and epidemiological characteristics of COVID - 19 remain limited… . ” [ 1 ] Insufficient data on transmission mechanisms , setting and activity specific risks , and population - specific disease burden may have reduced the effectiveness , efficiency , and equity of the public health response . [ 2 ] An established literature on emerging respiratory virus epidemics provides a framework for evaluating the adequacy of Covid - 19 data required for policy and management decisions . Lessons learned from prior epidemics including H1N1 influenza ( H1N1 ) , Severe Adult Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS - CoV - 1 ) , and Middle - East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) all inform CDC pandemic plans for emerging influenza viruses . The CDC’s pandemic interval framework [ 3 ] and the pandemic severity assessment framework [ 4 ] explicitly spell out the scientific and data needs for assessing the risks posed by emerging respiratory viral infections . Reviews critically examining the epidemiology of the H1N1 pandemic response elaborate on these data demands , [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] which were re - iterated at the onset of the COVID - 19 pandemic . [ 9 , 10 ] A scoping study is a method to examine the extent , range , nature of evidence or research activities in a particular field and to identify research gaps . [ 11 ] Here , we report on a scoping study of COVID - 19 epidemiologic parameters for infectious transmission , infection severity , and disease burden which , collectively , inform the threat level posed by an emerging respiratory virus epidemic and guide an efficient , proportional and equitable public health response . [ 8 ] . We first synthesize current authoritative federal government appraisals for each of these parameters . We then summarize the methods and outcomes of epidemiologic investigations published by CDC - affiliated investigators informing the aforementioned parameters . We focus specifically on CDC appraisals and investigations because of the .

Transmission studies also identify populations relatively more susceptible to infection as well as groups or settings relatively more likely to contribute to transmission . [ 12 ] Additionally , transmission studies can quantify pre - symptomatic transmission and the proportion of infections that are symptomatic ( the clinical fraction ) . These latter two parameters will , in part , determine the feasibility of isolation and contact tracing strategies . [ 13 , 14 ] Optimal understanding of transmission and an equitable mitigation response requires that studies include diverse community settings ( e . g . , household , workplace , school , and congregate living such as long - term care facilities and shelters ) . Infection severity measures include estimates of the proportion of infected individuals who require hospitalization or who die . Estimates of infection severity depend upon probable and confirmed case definitions and thus on the surveillance systems that ascertain infection and infection - related morbidity and death . Severity measures are vulnerable to many biases and may vary by place and over time as surveillance methods , case definitions , testing strategies , clinical understanding , and prevention efforts evolve . Cohort studies including large case ascertained studies ( where households are enrolled after an index case is identified ) with adequate follow up can provide reliable estimates of disease severity measures in addition to informing transmission risks . [ 8 ] Disease burden is the product of infection transmission and severity contextualized by socio - demographic and environmental risk factors and their disparities . Measures of disease burden include the incidence and prevalence of illness , numbers of people hospitalized , and infection - related deaths . Systematically monitoring health care visits for infection - related illness is one reliable indicator of the disease burden if such surveillance is combined with routine testing of a representative sample of patients visits .

The CDC’s Pandemic Severity Assessment Framework ( PSAF ) , an element of the national pandemic strategy , integrates the aforementioned transmission , severity and disease burden parameters into a qualitative assessment of the threat posed by an emerging infection . [ 4 ] Such risk assessments should be updated as the epidemic evolves , and data improves . Table S1 ( Supplemental Materials ) illustrates CDC’s application of the PSAF for 2009 Influenza H1N1 . [ 4 ] We accessed public CDC webpages ( See list in supplemental Materials , Table S2 ) to find current federal estimates of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , infection severity , and disease burden parameters and their data sources . We also searched specifically for documents containing applications of pandemic risk assessment tools , such as the PSAF . To evaluate original contributions to COVID - 19 epidemiology by CDC - affiliated investigators , we first reviewed all studies in the collection of COVID - 19 research in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR ) —a principal vehicle for publishing studies conducted by CDC investigators and their state partners—as well as the CDC COVID - 19 Science update webpage . We further searched PubMed for studies with COVID - 19 in the title or abstract , a medical subject heading ( MeSH ) for epidemiology , and CDC as an affiliation . Additionally , we examined the COVID - 19 research collections in Emerging Infectious Disease , Clinical Infections Disease ( CID ) , the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) , and the New England Journal of Medicine ( NEJM ) . We included studies published from 1 Jan to 30 Oct 2020 . We excluded studies that did not present quantitative data . We classified each included study as either descriptive or analytic and then abstracted published information on study design , data source , setting , population , and outcomes . ( Supplemental Materials , Table S3 ) We considered a study descriptive if it did not evaluate or formally test a hypothesis using a .

We classified studies that quantified risk of infection , disease severity , or transmission through an established epidemiological method as analytic . If a study reported both descriptive and analytic components , we classified it as analytic . We subcategorized descriptive studies by their design as : case study , case series , cluster or outbreak investigation , cross - sectional or ecologic survey . We categorized the designs of analytic studies as either cross - sectional , case - control , ecologic prospective cohort , or retrospective cohort designs . We identified each study’s data source as either passive , sentinel , syndromic , or active surveillance programs , administrative program records , medical records , or survey instruments . We also categorized each study with regards to its setting and population . We abstracted study outcomes as reported by the investigators . For each study other than those in the case studies and the case series , cluster and outbreak categories investigations , we identified outcomes contributing to any of the key aforementioned epidemiologic parameters .

The majority of CDC transmission data estimates have relied on epidemiological studies conducted outside the U . S . With regards to disease severity , CDC estimates the asymptomatic fraction as 40 % but with a wide range ( 10 - 70 % ) based on summary estimates from meta - analytic reviews as well as individual studies . [ 1 ] CDC estimated case fatality and case hospitalization ratios in May 2020 but later removed these parameters . [ 37 ] In September 2020 , CDC adapted infection fatality ratios from an analysis of European data . [ 1 ] CDC estimates risk ratios for hospitalization and death for age groups and race / ethnicity based on data from the COVID - NET active surveillance program . [ 38 ] No estimates of relative risks for infection , hospitalization or death exist for occupations or particular community activities or settings . Since April 2020 , CDC has reported several COVID - 19 disease incidence measures on a weekly basis , including emergency department visits for coronavirus - like illness ( CLI ) , SARS - CoV - 2 associated hospital admissions , and deaths from pneumonia , influenza , and COVID - 19 [ 39 ] . CDC additionally reports some of these incidence measures at the level of states or multi - state regions . CLI emergency department visits represent those for fever plus cough and / or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing and come from National Syndromic Surveillance Program ( NSSP ) that collects and integrates data on ED visit symptoms from a large share of the countries emergency department in 47 states . CDC’s COVID - NET program conducts active surveillance for laboratory - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 hospitalizations in 13 participating sub - state regions publishing age - stratified incidence rates weekly . CDC reports the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia or influenza as well as weekly counts of COVID - 19 attributed deaths for each .

Total excess deaths by cause of death is also available for each state . [ 40 ] In July 2020 , CDC reported seroprevalence estimates from 10 sites based on COVID - 19 antibodies detected in serum samples collected by commercial laboratories for reasons other than COVID - 19 . [ 41 ] After Aug 2020 , CDC expanded seroprevalence reporting to all U . S . states and has been reporting estimates every two weeks . In December 2020 , CDC provided the first estimates of cumulative prevalence of infection and symptomatic infection at a national level . [ 42 ] CDC affiliated investigators published 133 epidemiologic studies through Oct 30 , 2020 . ( Supplemental materials Table S3 ) Of these 133 studies , 99 were descriptive and 34 analytic .

Most descriptive studies summarized laboratory confirmed cases of SARS - CoV - 2 infection from a particular setting , disaggregating counts by clinical outcomes , by patient demographic or medical attributes , by exposure type , or by temporal patterns . Descriptive studies reported data from a wide range of populations and community settings . Some descriptive studies postulated mechanisms of transmission or prevention ; however , they did not estimate quantitatively infection transmission or disease severity parameters . Sixteen of the descriptive studies reported on the incidence or prevalence of laboratory confirmed infection , clinical illness , hospitalization or death in either the general population or a defined subpopulation ( e . g . , skilled nursing facility residents , healthcare workers , incarcerated or homeless individuals ) for a defined time period . [ 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 41 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 ] . One study provided a point estimate of excess deaths associated with COVID - 19 using national vital statistics data . [ 57 ] We classified thirty - four studies as analytic . Most ( 31 / 34 ) were published after June 2020 and in the publication MMWR ( 27 / 34 ) . The remainder were published in other peer - reviewed journals . Most of the analytic studies had general population subjects ( 27 / 34 ) , had cross - sectional ( 17 / 34 ) or ecologic ( 8 / 34 ) designs , and utilized field ( 10 / 34 ) or survey data ( 11 / 24 ) . Most analytic studies estimated at least one parameter for transmission , infection severity , or disease burden . Of the analytic studies estimating transmission parameters , three estimated secondary infection risks ( SIR ) [ 58 , 59 , 60 ] One of these was a follow up study of the first 12 confirmed cases in the US [ 58 ] Two others estimated the SIR for household contacts [ 59 , 60 ] . Our searches found no studies estimating the SIR for workplace , school or community settings or for particular occupations or industries . Eleven analytic studies provided estimates of an effect measure for risk factors for laboratory - confirmed infections . [ 59 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 68 , 69 , 70 ] Five of the eleven were conducted using a sample of the general population . These examined the frequency or particular demographics , [ 61 ] neighborhood deprivation / social vulnerability levels , [ 63 , 68 ] relationship to a confirmed case , [ 59 ] and recent social .

[ 66 ] Other investigations examined various factors related to confirmed infection in sub - populations , including face coverings and distancing among occupants of a military ship , [ 62 ] ethnic composition of employees of industrial facilities , [ 64 ] shelter residence status among people experiencing homelessness , [ 69 ] screening strategies and staffing levels in skilled nursing facilities . [ 65 , 67 ] Eight of the eleven studies employed cross - sectional or ecologic designs . No studies examined the independent effects of etiologic variables in multi - variate analysis . Seven studies examined risk factors for severe disease outcomes , including hospitalization , ICU stay and death . Most of these used general population subjects . [ 52 , 63 , 71 , 72 , 73 , 74 , 75 ] These studies consistently found older age to be a strong predictor of need for ICU stays , mechanical ventilation and of death . Male gender , end - stage renal disease , coronary artery disease , and neurologic disorders , immunocompromising conditions , pregnancy , African American identity were also correlated with severe disease . [ 71 , 72 , 73 , 52 , 75 ] One study estimated the odds of prolonged symptoms in relation to disease severity . [ 74 ] No CDC - affiliated studies estimated infection - hospitalization or infection - fatality ratios . Three studies assessed symptom prevalence or the fraction of symptomatic people among individuals with positive tests . One study , conducted in a military setting , found that 18 . 5 % ( 44 / 238 ) of those with positive tests were asymptomatic . [ 62 ] Two community studies found that nearly all household contacts of an index case had symptoms or developed them shortly after testing positive . [ 76 , 77 ] Nine analytic studies reported on indirect health impacts of COVID - 19 , including impacts on emergency departments visits , trends in childhood vaccination , telehealth visits , workplace absenteeism , mental health symptoms , and characteristics associated with delay or avoidance of medical care . [ 78 , 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86 ] One found declines in emergency care visits for heart attacks , strokes , and diabetes ; [ 81 ] one found an increased prevalence of mental health symptoms ; [ 85 ] one found increased absenteeism in non - healthcare essential workers ; [ 82 ] and two documented an initial decline followed by a rebound in childhood vaccination rates .

However , despite a substantial number of original epidemiological investigations , our review finds data gaps which may limit efficient interventions to prevent COVID - 19 transmission . We restricted this scoping study to epidemiological studies authored or co - authored by CDC investigators . Thus , our review may have also overlooked data found in pre - prints and other unpublished analyses . However , estimating transmission , infection severity and disease burden parameters generally require detailed individual case records or contact tracing data for which access is restricted to government agencies . Infectious Transmission CDC’s current estimates of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission parameters , including the incubation period , serial interval , and timing and duration of infectiousness , come from studies conducted outside the U . S . yet are consistent across settings and time - periods and thus considered reliable . On the other hand , CDC estimates of the clinical fraction have a wide range , reflecting significant heterogeneity among study methods , settings and populations . [ 87 , 88 , 89 , 90 ] Large or multi - regional case - ascertained studies or examination of contact tracing follow up data conducted in the US could provide more precise and age - specific estimates of this parameter as well as of the impact of asymptomatic spread in different settings . Context - specific estimates of the SIR , including for schools , workplaces , and other community settings , remain unavailable . These parameters require large or setting - specific transmission studies . Available estimates of the SIR for household transmission also vary widely with few based on US settings . No identified transmission studies have quantitatively examined the efficacy of modifying exposure factors within households or workplaces . .

For example , pre - symptomatic transmission , proximity , and an inability to mask are the facts used to justify restrictions on indoor dining in restaurants ; [ 91 ] Such restrictions may well be protective ; however , rigorous studies quantifying transmission risks for restaurant settings have not been undertaken . Studies comparing estimates of the SIR across community settings and activities could identify high risk activities and prioritize risk reduction interventions . Large coordinated case - ascertained prospective studies in particular could be a valuable tool to determine risks from specific activities in household , community , business , transportation , and educational settings and assess the risk reduction associated with operating rules for interrupting transmission . Such studies could inform the relative population - level impacts of social distancing , indoor versus outdoor settings , infectivity of high - touch surfaces , and the value of indoor ventilation . The state - to - state variation in policy response also provides natural experiments to evaluate the relative effectiveness of mandatory and voluntary community mitigations measures . While several case series and outbreak investigations have highlighted potential hazards in “essential” and frontline work settings such as food production , no identified analytic studies quantified determinants of risks of transmission in workplace settings . Case control studies examining comparative risks across industries and occupations could contribute to understanding how occupational exposures contribute , both directly and through household exposures , to COVID - 19 racial disparities . Studies authored by CDC investigators during the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic illustrate the value of timely , robust transmission epidemiology . During 2009 , CDC investigators conducted a number of influential transmission studies within the first nine months of the onset of the H1N1 epidemic . One , conducted on the basis of state - submitted case reports in the first months of the epidemic , found that odds ratios for H1N1 infection among household contacts were 3 . 5 times ( 1 . 6 – 8 . 0 ) higher for 0 - 4 year old and 2 times ( 1 . 1 - 3 . 6 ) higher for 5 - 18 years old than for 19 - 50 year old individuals . [ 92 ] Another CDC study combined data from 7 household transmission studies early in the 2009 pandemic to quantify the .

[ 93 ] A meta - analysis of 47 studies on transmission rates in households , schools , workplaces , and social events , including fifteen in settings within the U . S . , identified multiple population determinants of secondary infection risks , including higher risks for students relative to teachers and for boarding versus day schools . [ 94 ] Disease Severity CDC’s estimates of the infection - fatality ratios ( IFR ) based on studies in six European countries may not be generalizable to the US . County to country differences in the prevalence of vulnerability factors , medical care , and ascertainment of infection affect this parameter . Community cohort studies could provide assessment of multiple infection severity parameters . While the CDC has established older age as a strong risk factor for severe COVID - 19 disease and characterized the relative risk associated with individual medical co - morbidities , [ 95 ] further inquiry could examine how the effects of age and co - morbidities vary for individuals with different levels of functional status and in different residential settings ( e . g . , skilled nursing , assisted living or independent community living ) . Burden of infection and disease To monitor disease burden , the CDC has routinely reported several measures of infection and disease incidence at the national and state level ; however , these measures have limited geographical resolution . Each state has utilized its own distinct sets of state and regional indicators , [ 96 ] along with state - specific benchmarks , to guide control activities . For calibrating mitigations , most states have relied heavily on laboratory - test - based “case” counts , which underestimate infection rates and vary depending on testing access and demand . [ 97 , 6 ] For such . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license It is made available under a is the author / funder , who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity .

[ 3 ] In fact , during the H1N1 pandemic , CDC discontinued state reporting of individual lab - confirmed cases two months after the initiation of the epidemic and initiated state reporting of total numbers of weekly H1N1 hospitalizations and deaths . [ 5 ] The CDC used these numbers along other surveillance data to provide monthly estimates of symptomatic illness , hospitalizations , and deaths . [ 98 ] During H1N1 , CDC also used syndromic surveillance data to model infection dynamics at sub - state regional level , illustrating important regional and temporal patterns of transmission relevant for control and planning decisions . [ 5 ] A robust , national approach to monitoring COVID - 19 in every region using multiple measures of disease incidence should be feasible . In July 2020 , the US Department of Health and Human Services required all hospitals to report COVID - 19 associated admissions to the Federal government as part of a new national reporting standard ; this data should allow publishing real time estimates of new hospital admissions by age at a regional level . Coronavirus - like - illness emergency department visits from the NSSP could also be a nationally consistent regional measure . Consistent application of surveillance measures across U . S . regions could lead to better informed and targeted mitigations and their evaluation . Disaggregating measures of infection and disease burden by community setting ( e . g . residential setting , workplaces , neighborhoods ) could further aide in targeting public health responses and focusing resources for testing , contact tracing and outbreak investigations . Since May , CMS has required reporting of confirmed cases and deaths from regulated skilled nursing facilities ; however , there is still little systematic data on the burden of infection , morbidity , and mortality in other community settings . Through the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System ( NNDSS ) , CDC has accumulated over 20 million case reports . These reports should contain exposure information on residence , occupation , travel . Analytic studies could combine exposure prevalence among confirmed cases along with population exposure prevalence to estimate attributable risks for each exposure . .

Regional differences in prevalence could explain part of the variation in the pace of infectious spread . Methods to assess exposure using antibodies have evolved and improved over the epidemic time course . [ 99 , 100 ] Applying serial seroprevalence studies both to estimate cumulative incidence and infection fatality rates should be an important subject of investigation . Conclusions Twelve months after the identification of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus , the understanding of COVID - 19 transmission , infection severity and disease burden has advanced , yet estimates of several essential epidemiological parameters remain absent or uncertain . Missing are comparative measures of transmission risk and disease burden for community exposure settings , including work in “essential occupations . ” Estimates for infection fatality and infection hospitalization ratios representative of US settings do not exist . Indicators of disease burden , though available , have insufficient resolution to inform targeted policy and programmatic responses . These epidemiological data gaps may be limiting the most efficient and equitable response to the COVID - 19 epidemic and underscore the importance of standardizing data collection priorities and protocols early during a rapidly emerging infectious disease epidemic . CDC scientists and staff have authored a large number of studies on COVID - 19 ; however , the majority are descriptive and provide low - quality evidence for policy and management decisions . The content of their investigations raises questions about whether and how an explicit national research agenda guided CDC epidemiological endeavors . CDC scientists have the access to data , the expertise , and the resources to provide the data necessary for an optimal epidemic response . Moving forward , the CDC should now plan for how it might develop and implement a timely , strategic , and prioritized national epidemiological data collection and research agenda for the next emerging infectious disease epidemic . .
