Effect of joint institutional change for promoting commercial use of university knowledge and scientific research Seokbeom Kwon 1 , 2 · Kazuyuki Motohashi 1 , 2 , 3 · Kenta Ikeuchi 3 Accepted : 13 August 2021 / Published online : 20 August 2021 © The Author ( s ) , under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media , LLC , part of Springer Nature 2021 Abstract Stimulating the university’s scientific research while encouraging the commercial use of the resulting knowledge is one of the foremost missions to science policymakers . This study examines the short - term impact of joint institutional changes for facilitating the commercial use of university knowledge and stimulating scientific research activities by introducing a research performance evaluation system on the university scientists’ research outcomes . Our empirical analysis is based on Japan’s national university reform in 2004 , which introduced institutional measures to support the income - generating activities of aca - demic staff while implementing a regular evaluation of their performance . Using data on over 5 , 000 scientists in Japan’s national and private universities , we find an increase in the research productivity among national university scientists without a significant change in their research quality by this institutional change . Moreover , we find evidence showing that the reform induced more scientists to engage in research that serves as a knowledge input for developing technological applications . These short - term effects are specific to the scientists in the Life Science domain and those who were inactive in developing technical applications before the reform . We discuss the contributions of the present study to the strain of literature on how an institutional change to encourage commercial use of univer - sity knowledge affects science and draw the implications for science policy therein .

Effect of joint institutional change… 1 3 1 Introduction To foster the use of university knowledge , a range of public policy measures such as ena - bling academic patenting ( e . g . , Bayh – Dole Act in the US ) , provision of tax exemptions or subsidies to firms that collaborate with universities for R & D ( Szücs , 2018 ; Veugelers & Cassiman , 2005 ) has been considered . However , these efforts were accompanied by a long - standing controversy over their consequence in science . Most of all , encouraging commercial use of university knowledge may induce university scientists to allocate fewer resources for fundamental research while increasing their efforts toward applied research ( Henderson et al . , 1998 ) . Such resource diversion may result in decreased fundamental research activities by leading university scientists to pursue the research that can bring more economic profits ( see , Lach & Schankerman , 2008 ) while undermining their efforts to basic science ( Cohen et al . , 1998 ; Partha & David , 1994 ) . Moreover , emphasis on generating profit from university knowledge may weaken the sci - entific reward system that has been a key driver for scientists’ disclosure and dissemination of their knowledge ( Rhoten & Powell , 2007 ) in exchange for peer’s recognition of their contribution to science ( Merton , 1973 ; Partha & David , 1994 ) . In return , this potentially undesirable consequence in science may function as an obstacle to encouraging the utiliza - tion of university knowledge ( Klein et al . , 2010 ) . To this concern , some researchers find evidence showing that pursuing commercial use of university knowledge does not necessarily impede ( Mowery et al . , 2004 ; Nelson , 2001 ) but can be compatible with ( Shibayama , 2012 ) or even complementary to stimulating fun - damental research ( among others , Agrawal & Henderson , 2002 ; Azoulay et al . , 2009 ; Fab - rizio & Di Minin , 2008 ; Goldfarb et al . , 2009 ; Van Looy et al . , 2006 ) . Azoulay et al . ( 2009 ) explained that the presence of such compatibility / complementarity is due to commercial technology development being a “byproduct” of scientific research . In contrast , others found that the institutional change diverted university scientists’ efforts from diffusing their knowledge or deter them from engaging in basic research , which slows down the cumula - tive process of science ( e . g . , Agrawal & Henderson , 2002 ; Murray & Stern , 2007 ) . The presence of mixed empirical findings is perhaps due to the complementarity and substitutability between pursuing commercial use of university knowledge and provision of incentive for fundamental research to coexist . To this complication , how to mitigate the probable substitution effect is an important policy inquiry . Several organizational meas - ures to incentivize scientists’ engagement in scientific research activities and disclosing / diffusing their scientific findings can be considered . For instance , formalizing evaluation of individual scientists’ performance using their research outcomes ( e . g . , number of publica - tions and research impact ) can enhance the universities’ research strategy ( Hicks , 2009 ) while stimulating individual scientist’s research activities . Nevertheless , a performance - based evaluation may induce the scientist’s strategic behavior ( e . g . , gaming the metric ) in resource allocation for research ( Frost & Brockmann , 2014 ; Geuna & Martin , 2003 ; Smith , 1993 ; Yamamoto , 2004 ) . Hence , whether and to what extent such institutional device func - tions as a complementary measure to the policy for encouraging commercial use of univer - sity knowledge remains an empirical question . Existing studies offer partial clues by focusing on analyzing the case of the US , where the government’s role in university governance is relatively weak , or continental Europe , where higher education systems have been traditionally governed by governmental author - ity . Accordingly , the question of how the institutional change toward encouraging com - mercial use of university knowledge and the introduction of the performance evaluation 1244 S . Kwon et al . 1 3 system at individual universities , which needs the joint initiatives of the government and individual universities , has been remained largely unaddressed . This gap is particularly acute to stakeholders of university research in some countries where transformed ( or will transform ) the university governance system ( e . g . , Japan , South Korea ) based on such joint initiatives . This study takes a step toward bridging this gap by addressing the above - briefed chal - lenges to examine how , if at all , a joint institutional change for facilitating commercial use of university knowledge and the introduction of university policy for stimulating scientific research affect the university scientists’ research outcomes . Our empirical analysis is based on Japan’s university reform in 2004 . By this reform , the status of Japanese national universities changed from governmental organizations to corporate entities . The goal of this change was to enhance the efficiency of national uni - versities’ operations by conferring more autonomy and flexibility in management ( Kang & Motohashi , 2020 ; Motohashi & Muramatsu , 2012 ; Oba , 2007 ; Yamamoto , 2004 ) . As the legal status of national universities was transformed into corporate entities , the reform was accompanied by various organizational changes for encouraging income - generating activi - ties of academic staff , 1 which placed substantial emphasis on the commercial use of uni - versity knowledge . Simultaneously , this reform enabled the national universities of Japan to regularly evaluate individual scientists’ performance , which was expected to encourage their scientific research activities . The case of the policy change in Japan in 2004 is also useful for devising a research design for a causal analysis because the reform was close to an exogenous event to the individual university scientists . There were long - standing politics and debate across stake - holders in the national university reform along with repeated setbacks and the advance of the discussion as the dominant political party changed ( Christensen , 2011 ; Yamamoto , 2004 ) . Accordingly , individual university scientists found it difficult to expect the timing of the reform , which mitigates the concern of the typical endogeneity issue in making causal inferences on the impact of the reform . Our data consist of more than 5000 scientists in Japan’s national or private universities , who were active in research from 2000 to 2008 . Given that the reform was specific to the national universities and the institutional change was an exogenous event to the individual scientists , we consider the national university scientists ( referred to hereinafter as NUS ) as the treatment group and the private university scientists ( referred to hereinafter as PUS ) as the comparison group . Our panel difference - in - difference ( DiD ) analysis finds a positive influence of the reform on university scientist’s research productivity with no significant change in the research impact for a short period . In addition , after the reform , more NUS engaged in research that serves knowledge inputs for developing technological applications than PUS did . Further analysis revealed that the observed findings were particular to the scientists in the Life Science domain . Also , the impact was specific to those who were not active in developing technical applications based on their knowledge before the reform . These find - ings suggest varying impacts of such institutional changes across the science domain and the individual’s prior interests in the commercial use of their knowledge . The contribution of our study is two - fold . First , we extend the strain of literature on how institutional change toward facilitating the commercial use of university knowledge affects 1 Here , academic staffs refer to faculty ( Professors , Associate professor or Lecturer , and Assistant profes - sor ) and researchers with non - faculty appointments . 1245 Chasing two hares at once ? Effect of joint institutional change… 1 3 science . Our study expands the scope of the previous discussion to the science policy options that may be worthy of consideration as a supplementary measure when commercial use of university knowledge is institutionalized . Second , in addition to revealing individual scientist’s strategic tradeoff between the vol - ume and quality of research in responding to the institutional change , we provide more nuanced policy implications by showing that the impact of such institutional change may differ by various factors including research domain and a scientist’s prior interest in the commercial use of scientific knowledge . The remainder of this paper is structured as follows . Section 2 provides background information about the national university reform in Japan . Then , we review empirical stud - ies on how the institutionally encouraged commercial use of university knowledge shapes the scientist’s research activities and scholarly works on the performance evaluation of individual university researchers and its probable consequences in their behaviors . Sec - tion 3 illustrates our empirical research design and presents the data . Section 4 illustrates the econometric model for the analysis of the data . Section 5 reports and discusses the analysis results . Finally , Sect . 6 presents the implications of the findings with concluding remarks . 2 Background 2 . 1 Commercialization of university knowledge and its consequence in science A large volume of studies has focused on investigating the relationship between university scientists’ patenting activities and their research outcomes , considering academic patenting as a proxy for the interest of university scientists in the commercial use of their knowledge . Henderson et al . ( 1998 ) examined the probable consequence of the increased patent - ing activities of US universities after the Bayh – Dole Act in 1980 in the average technical importance of university patents . Their analysis showed that before the mid - 1980s ( around the Bayh – Dole Act ) , the US university patents ( vs . random - sampled patents ) were more cited by subsequent patents in various technology domains . However , this finding disap - peared in the later period . Based on the findings , the authors argued that in contrast to the expectation , the Bayh – Dole Act in the US was not effective in driving university sci - entists to develop commercially valuable inventions , suggesting that academic patenting promotion is ineffective in shifting the academic scientists’ interest toward commercial inventions . Nelson ( 2001 ) and Mowery , Nelson , Sampat and Ziedonis ( 2004 ) extended this con - clusion by shedding light on the effect of the Bayh – Dole Act on the research activities of the university scientists . Their studies using the case of the University of California , Stan - ford University , and Columbia University showed no evidence on which the Bayh – Dole Act diverted university scientists from basic research . After the Bayh – Dole Act , there was a surge in patenting and licensing of universities ; however , these were mainly caused by prior time trends rather than the consequence of the act . Agrawal and Henderson ( 2002 ) more directly examined the relationship between uni - versity scientists’ patenting activities and their research performance . Through quantitative and qualitative analyses on the patenting activities of the faculty of the mechanical engi - neering department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , the study showed that only a minor portion of the faculty patented on their research outcomes . More interestingly , 1246 S . Kwon et al . 1 3 the analysis found no systematic correlation between the MIT faculty’s patenting activities and the number of publications , but a positive association exists between MIT faculty’s patenting activities and the citation impact of the research papers . These findings suggest that university scientists’ patenting activities may not divert their endeavors from funda - mental research . Fabrizio and Di Minin ( 2008 ) advanced this conclusion with empirical evidence show - ing that the university faculty’s patenting complements their research publication activities . By using inventor name information in the NBER patent dataset along with a manual web search of inventor’s personal information ( e . g . , affiliation ) , they analyzed the correlation between faculty’s patenting and two measures of their research activities , namely , the num - ber of published research papers and citation rate of the papers . Their analysis revealed that faculties published more research papers after they file patents . However , the citation rates of the research papers were neither significantly nor negatively correlated with the number of patents the faculty filed . These findings agree on the conclusion that academic patenting activities are not substitutes for fundamental research activities . Azoulay et al . ( 2009 ) extended this conclusion . Using the data on Ph . D . degree recipi - ents in biomedical fields , they found that the scientists’ patenting activities are positively associated with their research productivity and the citation rate ( moderately ) . More inter - estingly , the analysis revealed a positive relationship between the extent to which a scien - tist’s research paper contains patentable ideas and the scientist’s patenting activity . Their findings concluded that academic patenting is a complementary activity to basic research and that it shifts the research of academic scientists to the area of commercial interest . Grimm and Jaenicke ( 2015 ) found a positive association between patenting activities and the publication performance of academic researchers in the German context . Their analyses using university employees in the three regions of Germany suggested that the greater the patenting activities of university researchers , the greater their publication per - formances in the future and vice versa . From their series of econometric analyses , they argued that a positive feedback relationship exists between the research publication activi - ties and patenting activities of the academic researchers . Through an event history analysis on the patenting activities of material science researchers in universities or public research organizations of Italy , Calderini , et al . ( 2007 ) showed that academic scientists’ hazard to file patents increased with the number of publi - cations and their citation rates on average . Their additional analyses revealed that the rela - tions take inverted U - shapes , indicating a nonlinear relationship between scientist’s com - mercial interest in their research and scientific research activities . Meanwhile , Lee ( 2019 ) has drawn a similar conclusion . By analyzing patenting and publication activities of the 632 full - time faculty at 46 Korean universities , the author showed that the patenting activities of faculty and their academic publication performance take an inverted U - shaped relationship . Besides , some studies focused on the impact of academic patenting on the dissemina - tion of university knowledge . In theory , scholars argued that academic patenting hampers university knowledge dissemination by inducing the so - called tragedy of anticommons ( Argyres & Liebeskind , 1998 ; David , 2004 ; Henderson et al . , 1998 ; Nelson , 2004 ) because the patent protection restricts access to the outcome of university research with an exces - sive cost for acquiring them , which could discourage innovation in return . Subsequent studies have empirically tested this concern . For example , Murray and Stern ( 2007 ) investigated whether patenting on scientific discoveries restricted knowledge dis - semination by analyzing the patent – paper pair data . By using the time difference between the timing of research paper publication and patent grants , they estimated the change in the 1247 Chasing two hares at once ? Effect of joint institutional change… 1 3 citation rate to the patent - paired research papers after the corresponding patent is granted . Their analysis showed 10 % – 20 % decrease in the citation rate to the corresponding research paper after a patent is granted , implying that the patenting on research hampers the scien - tific knowledge flow . Meanwhile , Rosell and Agrawal ( 2009 ) attempted to shed empirical light on how the increasing patenting activities of university associates with the narrowness of the dissemi - nation of university knowledge . They estimated the diversity of entities whose inventions became the knowledge input for university inventions ( inflow ) and the breadth of the enti - ties whose inventions were influenced by the university inventions ( outflow ) over time . Their analysis using the US universities’ patents revealed that the inflow and outflow of the university knowledge measured by patent citations decreased over time . They concluded that the knowledge dissemination by the university has narrowed down by the increased academic patenting . Interestingly , Magerman , et al . ( 2015 ) drew the opposite conclusion . Their analysis of patent – paper pairs in biotechnology showed a greater citation rate of publications having patent pairs than those without patent pairs . Their author - level analyses further showed that the H - indices of authors having publication – patent pairs were greater than their counter - parts . These findings suggested that academic patenting does not hamper knowledge dis - semination in the biotechnology domain . 2 . 2 Performance evaluation and its impact on scientists’ behavior Evaluating the performance of academic staff in universities takes an important part in examining the socio - economic and scientific impact of university research while being an important ground for designing university policy . By evaluating the university researcher’s performance , stakeholders of university policy are informed about the public value con - tributed by the university , the research projects that need support , and how the impact of university research is delivered ( Penfield et al . , 2014 ) . However , scholars in public administration and management suggested that the eval - uation of scientists’ performance may distort their incentive for research and eventually results in unintended consequences . According to Smith ( 1993 ) and follow - up studies ( e . g . , Bevan & Hood , 2006 ; Heinrich & Marschke , 2010 ; Van Thiel & Leeuw , 2002 ) , the intro - duction of performance evaluation system into public organizations may lead employees’ concentration on tasks directly related to the performance evaluation criteria , thus pursuing the tasks for their narrow purpose instead of the organizational goal , while trying not to be an “outlier” from the evaluation perspective . Consequently , the employees are disincentiv - ized for bringing innovative ideas into the job place . In the university context , a similar concern has been raised . In the U . K . , a widely per - ceived concern is that university research performance evaluation leads scientists’ selec - tive engagement in research projects wherein the economic impact is visible and relatively easy to be credited while dissuading them from the curiosity - driven research projects . 2 This concern later led to a petition against legalizing the university performance evalua - tion in the U . K . Scholars in the science policy domain provide some supportive evidence 2 See Statement on the research excellence framework proposal by University and College Union ( 2011 ) . Available at https : / / www . ucu . org . uk / media / 3600 / State ment - on - the - Resea rch - Excel lence - Frame work - propo sals / pdf / ucu _ REFst ateme nt _ final signa tures . pdf . 1248 S . Kwon et al . 1 3 by showing that the novel research projects are often recognized as “risky project” under the research performance evaluation criteria ( Butler , 2003 ; Hicks , 2012 ) and thus biased against funding decisions ( Boudreau et al . , 2016 ; Wang et al . , 2017 ) . Yamamoto ( 2004 ) argued that the introduction of the regular performance evaluation for academic staff in the national universities of Japan may dissuade the scientists from novel / innovative research projects requiring a longer time to invest to concentrate on the research subject that they can publish ( relatively ) easily and quickly . Alvesson and Sandberg ( 2013 ) made a somewhat similar argument by discussing why the impactful research in management studies decreases although the volume of published research papers has been substantially growing . They argued that this is due to the insti - tutional condition in which universities assess the performance of university researchers according to their number of publications . Under this evaluation criterion , the faculty and researchers are incentivized to invest their resources in maximizing the number of publica - tions rather than investing their resources in conducting highly impactful research . Further , Frost and Brockmann ( 2014 ) provided qualitative evidence of this argument by interviewing German university faculty . Their study showed that the faculty behaved strategically to meet the performance review criteria with less concern about the quality or impact of their research outcomes because of the outcome - related performance indicator and evaluation of the faculty performance . Seeber et al . ( 2019 ) provided empirical evidence illustrating how individual researchers may strategically behave in responding to the institutionalization of research performance evaluation . Their analysis based on an institutional change in Italy in 2010 , which required the academic researchers to meet certain ( research paper ) citation threshold to be profes - sors , showed that academics in Italy strategically cite their own works ( self - citation ) to meet the new requirements to be professors . Their findings indicate that researchers game with the metrics in responding to the institutionalization of the metric - based research per - formance evaluation system . Geuna and Martin ( 2003 ) situated this concern in the research funding allocation prac - tice . They argued that the link between the performance evaluation result and the allocation of research funding may “homogenize” the research and university activities by motivating the scientists to choose research projects that will likely receive research funding . Also , it may drive the scientists to find “safe ground” in being evaluated for their performance , causing the so - called “publication inflation” while discouraging their engagements in inno - vative / risky research projects . As a relevant study , Tapinos , et al . ( 2005 ) focused on the relationship between the intro - duction of the performance measurement system and the setting of organizational direc - tion ( i . e . , organizational mission , and strategic goal ) in the university context . Their study based on the case of the University of Warwick in the U . K . reveals that university perfor - mance measurement systems enabled top managers at the University of Warwick to iden - tify their strengths and weaknesses in achieving academic excellence . Moreover , the indi - vidual employees at the University of Warwick interpreted the university’s direction based on how their performances are evaluated . This study suggests that the introduction of the performance review system for evaluating academic staff in the universities has an impact on setting the direction of the university . In turn , it influences individual academic staffs’ behavior by leading them to interpret the university’s organizational setting . Civera , et al . ( 2020 ) examined how evaluating research performance using metrics may affect the institute’s research performance . Their analysis of the impact of an institu - tional change toward advancing the academic excellence of German universities through the additional allocation of public funding based on the research performance at the 1249 Chasing two hares at once ? Effect of joint institutional change… 1 3 institution - level results in increasing research outcomes at the cost of the research quality , which presents both positive and adverse effects of institutionalization of research perfor - mance evaluation system . 2 . 3 National University Reform of Japan in 2004 As discussed above , institutionalizing formal evaluation of individual scientists’ research performance can incentivize their research activities . This suggests that the institutional change toward formalizing university scientist’s research performance can be effective ( at some costs ) to mitigate the undesirable consequence of the policy change toward promot - ing the commercial use of university research . To examine if this institutional complemen - tarity exists and how it influences the university scientist’s research activities , we analyze the case of the national university reform of Japan . In this section , we provide background information on the national university reform of Japan in 2004 . Following the New Public Management movement ( Christensen , 2011 ) , the Japanese government enacted a law that changes the status of national universities of Japan from governmental organizations to corporate entities in April 2004 . The primary purpose of this reform was to promote inter - university competition by relaxing the governmental restriction on the operation of national universities . Toward this end , the change expanded the autonomy and flexibility in the management of national university operations . The change of national universities’ status to the “corporate” entities was accompanied by vari - ous measures for economizing their operating cost and promoting the income - generating activities of the academic staff in the national universities . For instance , by steadily reducing the central government’s institutional fund , NUS were encouraged to seek external research funds , including funding from the private sectors or competitive funding ( Kneller , 2003 ; Shibayama , 2011 ; Watanabe , 2011 ) , which later influ - enced their invention and research activities ( e . g . , Kang & Motohashi , 2020 ; Wang et al . , 2018 ) . As a result , the number and size of university - industry joint research projects dra - matically increased . In addition , the governmental restriction on national universities’ patent ownership and their enforcement were substantially relaxed ( Motohashi & Muramatsu , 2012 ) . Before the reform , national universities could own patents for some exceptional cases ( Shimoda , 2004 ) . By the reform , national universities became free to own patents , resulting in a four - fold increase in the number of patent applications filed by the national universities after four years from the reform ( Motohashi & Muramatsu , 2012 ) . Whether or not universities’ patent ownership is an optimal regime for promoting the commercial use of their knowl - edge remains questionable ( Kalantaridis , 2019 ) . However , this institutional change was expected to incentivize the profit - generating activities of university researchers with their research outcomes by facilitating technology transfer and linking the outcome of successful commercialization to the researcher’s private profit . Along with this change , the operations of Technology Licensing Offices of the national universities were reinforced to support the university scientists’ income - generating activi - ties ( Oba , 2007 ; Woolgar , 2007 ) . Another notable organizational change was the introduction of the regular performance review of academic staff . By the reform , all the national universities are required to set the mid - term organizational goals ( Chyukikeikaku ) and submit the corresponding plan every five years to the Ministry of Education , Culture , Sports , Science and Technology ( MEXT ) of Japan . The MEXT evaluates national universities’ performance based on their 1250 S . Kwon et al . 1 3 ( 1 ) educational service , ( 2 ) research performance ( e . g . , research paper publications ) , ( 3 ) contribution to society ( e . g . , technology transfer , patents ) . Based on the evaluation results , the MEXT decides the amount of budget that it will allocate lump sum to the national universities . The MEXT’s evaluation and the resulting budget allocations induce national univer - sities to establish systems to evaluate their employees . For instance , at the University of Tokyo , academic staffs’ job performance including research performance ( research paper publication records , conference presentations , research grants , etc . ) and social contribution ( patenting , technology transfer , collaborative research with industrial partners , etc . ) are evaluated regularly ( with some variations by departments and research centers ) by the head of each division . Academic staff is required to report their educational services , research activities , and other activities that contribute to society . In this report , individual academic staff reports not only their publication or patenting but also external research grants , tech - nology transfer , collaboration with firms that they engaged . Later , the evaluation result can be used as the basis for determining academic staff’s promotion and salary level . As a con - sequence , the reform significantly transformed the working environment of the academic staff at the national universities , especially in a way that individual academic staff is incen - tivized to spend their best efforts toward improving educational service , research perfor - mance , and contribution to society . The changes induced by the national university reform of Japan were expected to enhance the operational efficiency of the national universities while fostering the research activities of university scientists for the commercial use of the research outcomes . In the next section , we describe how we utilize the case of the national university reform of Japan in 2004 as a quasi - natural experiment to examine the impact of the joint insti - tutional change for promoting commercial use of university knowledge and the research activities on the university scientist’s research activities . By considering that the national university reform of Japan was a major institutional change that was specific to the national universities while the private universities take an important part of the higher education system of Japan along with the national universities , our empirical strategy is based on comparing the change in the research activities of researchers at national universities and those at private universities after the reform . 3 Data 3 . 1 Sample Our sample consists of scientists in national or private universities of Japan who were active in publishing original research articles in SCI ( E ) journals from 2000 to 2008 . 3 Our empirical strategy is a short - term comparison of NUS and PUS in their research produc - tivity , research quality , and whether the research outcome serves as a knowledge input for developing technological applications . Because the reform was specific to the national uni - versities , we consider the NUS as the treated group whereas the PUS as the comparison group . 3 MEXT of Japan established a new framework for financially assisting private universities in 2013 ( Yam - ada , 2018 ) . Although this policy change was specific to the private universities , it occurred in 2013 , which is out of the period of analysis of the present research ( 2000 to 2008 ) . 1251 Chasing two hares at once ? Effect of joint institutional change… 1 3 3 . 2 Identifying the researchers and retrieving the researcher‑level information By considering an original research article as a body of new scientific knowledge and its first author as the key scientist who contributed to the research , we start by selecting the first authors of the journal papers who were affiliated with either national or private uni - versities in Japan before the reform . Our sampling strategy is to choose the university scientists who continued scientific research while staying in the same university during the period between 2000 and 2008 . Individuating scientists in Japan One of the empirical challenges in conducting sci - entist - level analysis is to precisely identify the scientists and individuate their informa - tion . We address this challenge by using the JGlobal Data , a registry of researchers in Japan . These data are provided by the Japan Science and Technology Agency , linking the identifier of scientists in public research organizations or universities in Japan to their Clarivate’s Web of Science ( WoS ) indexed SCI ( E ) journal papers . Although this registry is based on self - registration , the coverage is surprisingly high . Our crosscheck using the WoS authorship information indicates that about 80 % of the first authors of SCI ( E ) journal papers published in Japanese universities appeared in the JGLOBAL data . Affiliation data Japan’s National Institute of Science and Technology Policy provides data that link WoS - indexed journal papers to the authors’ affiliation information when the affiliated organizations are in Japan . We identify the university scientists in Japan by using these data . Metadata of SCI ( E ) journal papers . Next , from the WoS core collection database , we retrieve the metadata of the SCI ( E ) journal papers that were published from 2000 to 2008 by the identified university scientists . Non - patent literature citation data . One of the variables that we employ in analysis measures whether a scientist of interest published research papers that were cited by patents . We obtain the paper – patent citation information from the Clarivate WoS patent citation information . Academic inventor To identify the scientists who were involved in patenting as inven - tors , we used the WoS author name – patent inventor name matching data provided by Ikeuchi and Motohashi ( 2020 ) . We start with the scientist who published research papers as the first author in 2004 . This is to narrowly identify the scientists who were in Japan’s national or private uni - versities around the reform timing . As a result , 9665 university scientists were identi - fied . Among them , the scientists who have published research papers from 2000 to 2003 and from 2005 to 2008 , without changing their affiliation , were selected . This strategy allows us to choose active university scientists who stayed in the same universities from 2000 to 2008 . Our data contain 5679 university scientists . Among them , 4529 ( 80 % ) were NUS ( treated group ) and 1150 ( 20 % ) were PUS ( comparison group ) . 1252 S . Kwon et al . 1 3 4 Measures 4 . 1 Dependent variables We use three dependent variables . The first variable is the number of SCI ( E ) journal papers published by each scientist in the sample ( nPubs ) . This variable measures the research productivity of the scientist . The second dependent variable is the mean value of the paper - age - normalized cita - tion counts that accrued to the research articles published by the scientist in question , considering the citation impact as a measure of the research quality . We take this vari - able’s natural log value with the addition of 1 ( ln ( PerYrCite + 1 ) ) to consider its right - skewed distribution . The third dependent variable is the measurement of the extent to which university scientist’s research serves as a knowledge input for developing technological applica - tions . Patents are granted for technologically novel , non - obvious , and industrially useful inventions , whereas patent’s citation to a research paper can be considered a paper trail of knowledge flow from scientific research to technical applications ( Narin & Noma , 1985 ; Narin et al . , 1997 ; Verbeek et al . , 2002 ) . Following this notion , we consider that scientific knowledge in a research article contributed to developing technological appli - cations if the research article was cited by patents . To rule out an obvious mechanical relationship driven by the fact that NUS were encouraged to file patents after the reform and those patents cite the scientist’s own research works ( i . e . , self - citation ) , we count the non - self - patent citations only . Our third dependent variable CiteFrmPat is a binary variable that takes the value 1 if the focal scientist published at least one research paper that was cited by patents , and 0 otherwise . 4 . 2 Independent variables In our analysis , we fit our data to the scientist - fixed effect ( FE ) panel DiD model . Toward this end , we first generate a binary variable that takes the value of 1 for NUS in Japan , and 0 for the PUS ( National ) . Then , we create another binary variable that takes the value of 1 for the observation for the post - reform period ( Post04 ) . Lastly , we gener - ate the interaction term between National and Post04 ( National × Post04 ) . The regres - sion coefficient of National × Post04 is the DiD estimator that quantifies the causal impact of the reform . 4 . 3 Control variables Several control variables are employed in regression to rule out probable spurious rela - tionships between the dependent and independent variables . First , we control for scien - tist’s research network size . In Japan , the national university serves as the main venue for basic science ( Kneller , 2003 ; Oba , 2007 ; Shibayama , 2011 ) . Thus , NUS may have a broader research network than PUS . Meanwhile , the research network size relates to the scientist’s research activities as explored by a myriad number of studies . To rule out the research network size effect , we introduce the number of coauthors of the focal scientist’s research articles . This variable is mechanically dependent upon the number of papers that 1253 Chasing two hares at once ? Effect of joint institutional change… 1 3 the focal researcher published ; thus , we use the “average number of coauthors” per paper ( AvgCouathors ) . Next , we control for scientist’s cross - disciplinarity in research . In Japan , national uni - versities are often established with diverse academic disciplinary , whereas private universi - ties specialize in certain academic fields in general . Accordingly , NUS may have greater opportunities to communicate and collaborate with researchers in various science disci - plines . Given that the novel combination of existing knowledge in various fields is one of the sources of scientific creativity ( Uzzi et al . , 2013 ) , whereas the research collaboration across the disciplines grows over time , NUS might have engaged more in cross - discipli - nary research than PUS . To account for this difference , we control for the cross - disciplinar - ity of scientists’ research by using the number of associated research areas ( WoS Subject categories ) to each scientists’ research paper ( BreadthRes ) . By the university reform , the governmental restriction on national universities’ own - ership over intellectual property rights such as patents was substantially relaxed . Conse - quently , NUS are likely to increasingly appear as the inventor in patents . Indeed , our data show that after the reform , 50 % more NUS filed patents than before the reform . Mean - while , scientists who are involved in the patenting process are perhaps those who have a particular interest in developing technical applications using their research , and this per - sonal tendency could associate with the nature of their conducted research . For instance , scientists who are active in patenting may have a strong self - motivation for commercial - izing the research outcomes than others . To consider this , we introduce a binary variable that takes the value of 1 for scientists who filed patents as an inventor , and 0 otherwise ( InventorDummy ) . Studies found that scientists’ career age is associated with their research activities . For instance , Zeng , et al . ( 2019 ) showed the extent to which a scientist switches research topics increases with the career age at a decreasing rate . Additionally , the higher the career age of a scientist , the more the research environment is established and the higher the career status is in general . As discussed by previous studies , the status of university scientists ( i . e . , professorship ) is likely to associate with the extent to which the scientist’s research activity is influenced by external components such as funding source ( Arora & Gambardella , 2005 ; Goldfarb , 2008 ; Wang et al . , 2018 ) . Meanwhile , the mandatory retiree age is longer for academic staff in private universities than the national universities ; therefore , the average academic age of PUS could be higher than that for the NUS . This probable systematic dif - ference may generate a heterogeneous distribution of the academic age of NUS and PUS . To rule out this probable compounding effect , we control for scientist’s career age fixed effect ( Age FE ) . In our data , a scientist’s career age in the pre - reform term is calculated as the year difference between 2004 and the earliest year of publication . For the post - reform period , the academic age is calculated into the year difference between 2008 and the earli - est year of publication of the scientist . We control for the extent to which the journals where a scientist published his / her papers are related to the applied research fields . We measure this based on the journal com - mercial impact factor ( JCIF ) that quantifies the extent to which papers published in a jour - nal are cited by patents . We create a binary variable JCIFDummy that takes the value of 1 if the journals where the scientist of interest published the research papers have positive JCIFs . We obtain these data from the recently disclosed data of Marx and Fuegi ( 2019 ) . Last , CiteFrmPat is mechanically correlated with the number of research papers that a scientist published . To rule out the probable compounding effect driven by this mechanical relationship , we control for nPubs in addition to the other control variables in regressing CiteFrmPat . 1254 S . Kwon et al . 1 3 4 . 4 Descriptive analysis Table 1 presents the summary statistics of the key variables for the treated and comparison groups . The data show notable changes on the average of nPubs and CiteFrmPat for NUS after the reform—the average of nPubs and CiteFrmPat increased for the NUS after 2004 more than those for the PUS . This observation suggests that the reform has boosted NUS’s research productivity and the extent to which their research outcomes serve knowledge input for technological application development . A comparison of the average change in AvgCouathors shows that the increase in the research collaboration network size for NUS is greater than that for PUS after the reform .

The absolute values of the correlations are below 0 . 5 . No critical multi - collinearity issue is indicated . Figure 1 displays the top 10 science disciplines of the NUS and PUS . Scientist’s disci - pline was operationalized into the most frequently appeared Web of Science Research Area ( WoS RA ) of research papers that the scientist published from 2000 to 2004 . Chemistry is the most populated field both for both NUS and PUS , followed by Life Science . For a macro - level comparison , we aggregate the research areas into three groups based on the WoS categorization scheme 4 : Life Science & Biomedicine , Physical Science , and Technology . Figure 2 profiles the distribution . In national universities , Physical Sci - ence was the most populated field , followed by Life Science . However , Life Science was the most prominent area , followed by Physical Science , among PUS . Figure 3 visualizes the mean values of the three dependent variables from 2000 to 2008 for each group of university scientists . As shown in Fig . 3a , the average of nPubs of NUS is greater than that of the PUS before the reform . This difference appears to be widened after the reform . Figure 3b compares the mean values of ln ( PerYrCite + 1 ) between the two groups of sci - entists . In both pre - and post - reform periods , the mean value for NUS is greater than that for PUS . However , whether the observed difference in the pre - reform period changes in the post - reform period is not evident . Figure 3c compares the mean of CiteFrmPat . The mean values of the NUS are seem - ingly overlapped with that of PUS in the pre - reform period . However , from 2005 , the mean for NUS becomes greater than that for PUS , and this difference persists . 4 . 5 Regression model We fit our data to the two - term panel DiD model . The variables are calculated by aggregating scientists’ research articles published in 2000 – 2003 ( pre - reform ) and Fig . 3 Time trend of means of dependent variables .

The DiD regression results without control variables are reported in the first three columns . The estimation results with the full set of control variables are shown from the fourth to the sixth columns . The results indicate that after the reform , NUS in Japan published more research papers than PUS . According to our estimation , an NUS published 1 . 14 more research papers than a comparable PUS . The coefficients of National × Post04 are statistically insignificant at the 0 . 1 significance level for ln ( PerYrCite + 1 ) . We found no evidence showing that the reform influenced the average research quality of NUS . 5 Meanwhile , the research papers of NUS were more likely to be cited by patents than those of a comparable PUS after the reform . According to the estimation presented in the third and sixth columns , 3 % – 4 % more research papers of NUS were cited by patents than those of PUS , which is statistically significant at the ( at least ) 0 . 1 significance level . We found modest evidence showing that the reform induced more NUS to engage in research that serves the knowledge input for developing technological applications . 5 . 2 Multi‑term DiD with matching The key assumption of DiD for causal inference is that the time trend of outcome variables for treated and comparison groups is parallel in the pre - treatment period . To ensure this assumption is not severely violated , we conduct an additional analysis using a matched sample of NUS and PUS in Japan . Our matching variables are all the three dependent vari - ables and the control variables that were measured pre - reform period ( i . e . , from 2000 to 2003 ) . Our matching combines the exact matching for binary variables and the nearest neighborhood matching for continuous variables . For each NUS , we search for PUS having the same ResearchArea , AcademicAge , Inven - torDummy , JCIFDummy , and nPubs in 2004 as the NUS . Among the matched PUS , we select one who is the nearest neighborhood , which is calculated based on the Euclidean distance for BreadthRes , AvgCouathors , ln ( PerYrCite + 1 ) measured for the period between 2000 and 2003 . This matching procedure reduced our sample size to 2966 ( 1483 NUS and PUS , for each ) . We run regression without control variables because our matching criteria include all the covariates . We fit our matched sample of university scientists to the multi - period DiD regression model as follows . Y i , t = 𝛽 0 + 03 ∑ j = 00 𝛽 j × YR j , i , t × National i , t + 08 ∑ k = 05 𝜃 j × YR j , i , t × National i , t + 03 ∑ j = 00 𝛾 j × YR j , i , t + 08 ∑ j = 05 𝜂 j × YR j . i , t + 𝜏 i + 𝜖 i , t 5 For robustness check , we also tested whether the maximum value of the paper age - normalized citation has changed after the reform . Our analysis finds no evidence on the change in the citation impact . 1260 S .

The regression results using the matched scientist sample are presented in Table 4 . The coefficients 𝛽 j are , by and large , not far from 0 . Especially , 𝛽 02 and 𝛽 03 ( i . e . , just before the reform ) are statistically insignificant at the 0 . 1 significance level except for the CiteFromPat . For the CiteFrmPat , the coefficient of YR03 × National was significant at the 0 . 1 significance level . In the first column , the coefficients of YR05 × National and YR06 × National are posi - tive and statistically significant at the 0 . 01 significance level . However , the coefficients of YR07 × National and YR08 × National are statistically insignificant at the 0 . 1 significance level . The short - term positive effect of the reform on research productivity is confirmed . In the second column , the coefficients of the interaction terms from YR05 × National to YR08 × National are statistically insignificant at the 0 . 1 significance level . Consistent with our main regression analysis results , no evidence has been found showing that the reform affected the average research quality of NUS . In the third column , the coefficients of YR05 × National and YR07 × National are positive and statistically significant at the 0 . 01 and 0 . 05 significance levels , respectively . However , the coefficient of YR08 × National is statistically insignificant at the 0 . 1 significance level . The short - lived positive effect of the reform on the extent to which research outcome serves knowledge input for technological application development is confirmed . All in all , our additional analysis yields consistent findings with the main regression analysis while additionally revealing a rather short - lived observed impact of the reform . We discuss the probable reason in the discussion section . 5 . 3 Selection by scientist mobility We used the data that include the university scientists who were active in publishing while staying in the same universities from 2000 to 2008 . However , the use of these data could cause sample selection for the differential mobility of scientists . By the national university reform , the status of NUS changed to non - civil servants , which could lead to some of the NUS leaving the universities . By triggered mobilization of NUS , our sample may retain the NUS who decided to stay in the same universities even after the reform , whereas PUS were unlikely to be subject to this self - selection issue . To empirically check whether the scientist’s mobility differs between the national and private universities after the reform , we conducted a simple exercise by using the samples of university scientists who were in the national or private universities in Japan before 2004 . Then , we identify the scientists who changed their affiliations after 2004 by referring to author affiliation information in the research articles that were published after the reform . Our data show that about 6 . 1 % of the NUS moved to different institutes after the reform , whereas 5 . 5 % of PUS did so . The difference was 0 . 6 % point . Our t - test indicates that this difference is statistically insignificant at the 0 . 1 significance level ( t = 0 . 89 , p - value = 0 . 37 ) . No evidence of the differential mobility between NUS and PUS has been found . 5 . 4 Selection by performance evaluation Our sampling strategy selected the scientists who published at least one research paper before and after the reform . A probable bias by this sampling strategy is that it could disproportionally exclude the NUS who were not “active” in research in the post - reform 1262 S . Kwon et al . 1 3 period compared to the PUS . This is because the academic staff’s performance evaluation was implemented in the national universities after the reform . To test if this selection bias was behind our findings , we examine whether an NUS is less likely to be retained than a PUS when applying our sampling strategy . We start by identifying all the university sci - entists who published at least one research paper from 2000 to 2003 . Then , we investigate how many of the NUS and PUS are excluded when we restrict our sample to those who also published research papers in the post - reform period . Our test shows that 80 . 2 % of PUS and 80 . 5 % of the NUS remained in the data . The t - test result presents that the difference is virtually zero ( p - value = 0 . 79 , t = − 0 . 26 ) , indicat - ing no evidence of the selection bias . 5 . 5 Heterogeneous effect 5 . 5 . 1 By previous experience in patenting Our main analysis found that the national university reform in Japan enhanced university scientists’ productivity while stimulating them to engage in research that contributes to developing technological applications without deteriorating their research quality . Which scientists were particularly influenced by the reform ? Was the reform influential to scientists who were not previously active in using their knowledge for technical applica - tion or effective to researchers who were active in developing technical applications before the reform , or both ? We believe that exploring the answer to this question can draw more nuanced policy implications to understand “how” the joint institutional changes shape the university research overall . If the impact was specific to the scientists who were already active in developing technical applications , it implies that the scope of the policy impact was somewhat targeted for helping those who had an interest in the commercial use of their knowledge . In contrast , if the impact was specific to scientists who were inactive in devel - oping technical applications beforehand , it indicates that the change induced spreading the culture of commercialization among university scientists . Considering that an academic researcher’s patenting is a revealed interest of the researcher in developing the technological applications , we operationalize a scientist’s activeness in developing technological applications before the reform by employing the information of whether the scientist appeared in patent applications as an inventor from 2000 to 2003 . Then , we run a separate regression for the group of scientists who appeared and did not appear as inventors of patents before the reform , respectively . Tables 5 and 6 present the regression results for each group of scientists . In Table 5 , the coefficients of the Post04 × National are statistically insignificant at the 0 . 1 significance level . In contrast , in Table 6 , the coefficients of Post04 × National are posi - tive and statistically significant at the 0 . 01 significance level for nPubs and the 0 . 05 signifi - cance level for CiteFrmPat . These findings imply the specific impact of the reform on the NUS who were inactive in developing technological applications before the reform . 5 . 5 . 2 By research field The extent to which scientific knowledge has a close interface with technical applica - tion differs by the domain of research ; thus , the impact of the university reform in Japan is likely to differ by the research field . Meanwhile , the field - level difference may also 1263 Chasing two hares at once ?

To estimate the causal effect of this joint institutional change , we conducted a DiD analysis using the novel data on scientists in Japan’s national and private universities . Our analysis found enhancement in research productivity of the NUS caused by the reform . Moreover , this reform induced more NUS to engage in the research that later served as a knowledge input for developing technical applications . Additional analysis revealed that the observed effects were specific to the scientists who were previously inactive in develop - ing technological applications and those who were in the Life Science domain . Our first two findings imply that encouraged commercial use of university knowledge could improve scientists’ research productivity while helping them pursue research that has commercial value when an institutional device for promoting their research activities is supplemented . Moreover , our analysis results suggest that such institutional changes direct university scientists to engage more in research that has a closer interface with technical application development . Given that this effect was particular to those who were inactive in developing technical applications before the reform , we argue that the reform has drawn more scien - tists to consider the commercial value of their research . We also observed that the impact of the joint institutional changes was specific to the scientists in Life Science , indicating the substantial field - level heterogeneity in the way and the extent to which individual scientists respond to such external environment change for their research activities . This finding is aligned with the prior studies showing the com - plementary relationship between scientific research activity and effort toward commercial use of the resulting knowledge in the Life Science domain ( Azoulay et al . , 2009 ; Mager - man et al . , 2015 ) . Meanwhile , our findings suggest that the presence of the complemen - tary relationship is unlikely to be omnipresent but depends on research fields , which calls for accounting for such field - level heterogeneity in further relevant policy and scholarly discussion . The Pasteur Quadrant concept ( Stokes , 1997 ) is useful for reasoning our findings . Stokes ( 1997 ) explained that scientists can pursue the quest for a fundamental understand - ing of scientific principles while considering the potential “use” of the resulting research outcomes ( i . e . , Pasteur domain ) . Scientists in the Life Science domain are often positioned in this environment as they pursue fundamental scientific understanding ; however , the research outcome is often turned into practical applications such as pharmaceutical prod - ucts and medical devices ( i . e . , the duality of knowledge ) . To the scientists in this domain , the joint institutional change for promoting commercial use of their knowledge and for implementation of a performance evaluation system might have functioned to simulate their research activities while leading more of them to actively consider the commercial use of the research outcomes . In our analysis , we could not find evidence of the changed quality / impact of research by the reform . This does not conclude the absence of reform’s effect on the average research quality / impact because our analysis was only for the short - term effect ( i . e . , for four years after the reform ) . Instead , this observation suggests no empirical evidence supporting the concern that the reform could divert scientist’s effort for basic science and retrograde the quality of research as a consequence . In our multi - term DiD analysis presented in Table 4 , we additionally found that the impact of the reform on NUS fades away as time goes by . Although this phenomenon could have many probable explanations , we argue that the emergence of the spillover effect of the reform over time could be one of the reasons . As the NUS and PUS tend to be 1269 Chasing two hares at once ? Effect of joint institutional change… 1 3 interconnected in the research community ( e . g . , research collaboration ) , the impact of the reform on the NUS could have diffused to the PUS as time goes by . Hence , the observed differences between national and private universities in their research performance indica - tors after the reform have faded away . The contribution of our study is two - fold . First , our study expands the scope of the long - standing discussion about how science is affected by the institutional change to facilitate the commercial use of university knowledge . The previous studies focused on empirical examina - tion on whether promoting commercial use of university knowledge diverts scientists from engaging in fundamental research . In addition to these studies , our study empirically showed that a joint introduction of an institutional measure for incentivizing the university scientists’ research activities may be worthy of consideration to mitigate the probable unintended conse - quence of promoting the commercial use of university knowledge in science . Second , our finding that the impact of the reform was specific to scientists who were previously inactive in developing technological applications provides a more nuanced uni - versity policy implication . Studies have found that the institutional environment where uni - versity scientists locate shapes the scientists’ commercial endeavors ( Bercovitz & Feldman , 2008 ; Owen - Smith & Powell , 2001 ) . Our study contributes to advancing this conclusion by empirically showing that nationwide university policy change for establishing a supportive institutional environment for the commercial endeavor of university scientists , along with incentivizing their scientific research activities , can stimulate “more” university scientists to consider the commercial potential of the university knowledge while not deteriorating their research activities . This study has limitations that we wish the future study to address . First , for the lack of data , we could not untangle the effect of the institutional change for promoting commercial use of university from the effect of institutionalizing the research performance evaluation . We believe that elucidating how each change worked and to what extent it becomes com - plementary to one another is helpful to elaborate on the underlying dynamics . Second , studies have suggested that scientists’ characteristics , such as age , gender , and socio - economic status , are associated with their research outcomes ( e . g . , Bercovitz & Feldman , 2008 ; Wang et al . , 2018 ) . In addition , individual scientists have a different level of prior experience in or preference over various pathways for commercial use of their knowledge ( e . g . , licensing , a spinoff ) , and such differences may moderate the direc - tion and size of the impact of the reform . For the lack of data , our study could not explore what characteristics of individual scientists moderate the impact of the reform . We wish the future studies can explore the empirical answers as they can provide nuanced implica - tions for designing a better university policy to promote science and the commercial use of its knowledge . Third , the joint institutional change by the national university reform in Japan could influence the mobility of the researchers , as discussed in Sect . 5 . 3 ( i . e . , change in entry and exit of the researchers ) . Researchers’ mobilization is a channel for knowledge transfer ( Criscuolo , 2005 ) and an important fact of inducing research collaboration ( Kato & Ando , 2017 ) . Hence , examining how the reform might have impacted the researchers’ mobility and their performance ( e . g . , Payumo , et al . , 2018 ) could provide additional implications for a more comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the national university reform in Japan .
