Findings : This systematic review and meta - analysis of all available data shows that SARS - CoV - 2 viral spread is limited and child - to - adult transmission in the school setting scarce . Summary estimates indicate that young index cases were 74 % significantly less likely than adults to favor viral spread and children are 43 % less susceptible than adults . Meaning : Overall , SARS - CoV - 2 circulation in schools was limited and could be reasonably controlled with appropriate mitigation measures . .

The contribution of children to viral spread in schools is still under debate . We conducted a systematic review and meta - analysis of studies to investigate SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the school setting . Methods : Literature searches from April , 2021 and repeated on May , 15 th 2021 yielded a total of 1088 publications : screening , contact tracing and seroprevalence studies . MOOSE guidelines were followed and data analyzed using random - effects models . Results : From screening studies involving more than 120 , 000 subjects , we estimated 0 . 31 % ( 95 % Confidence Interval [ CI ] 0 . 05 - 0 . 81 % ) SARS - CoV - 2 point prevalence in schools . Contact tracing studies , involving a total of 112 , 622 contacts of children and adults , showed that onward viral transmission was limited ( 2 . 54 % ; 95 % CI 0 . 76 - 5 . 31 ) . Young index cases were found to be 74 % significantly less likely than adults to favor viral spread ( Odds Ratio [ OR ] = 0 . 26 ; 95 % CI 0 . 11 - 0 . 63 ) and were less susceptible to infection ( OR = 0 . 60 ; 95 % CI 0 . 25 - 1 . 47 ) . Finally , from seroprevalence studies , with a total of 17 , 879 subjects involved , we estimated that children are 43 % significantly less likely than adults to test positive for antibodies ( OR = 0 . 57 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 49 - 0 . 68 ) . In conclusion , testing all subjects in schools , independently of symptoms , students less likely than adults favor viral spread and SARS - CoV - 2 circulation in schools was found to be limited .

School closures have been implemented internationally as a common strategy to control the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 during the pandemic , based on the assumption that children may represent important vectors for viral spread . According to UNESCO , 188 countries have imposed countrywide school closures , affecting more than 1 . 5 billion children and youth , and schooling has been disrupted for an average of 25 weeks worldwide from the beginning of the pandemic until March 2021 , due to complete or partial closures ( www . unesco . org ) . The consequences of school closures could be dramatic . It has been estimated that over 100 million children will fall below the minimum proficiency level in reading due to the impact of COVID - 19 school closures ( www . unesco . org ) , and children with disabilities and special needs , or living in countries or areas with poor digital connectivity , are especially hard to serve through remote schooling . Beyond providing instruction , school plays a pivotal role in children education , development , and well - being . According to UN reports , over 300 million children rely on school meals for a regular source of daily nutrition , and rising malnutrition is expected among the most vulnerable . Lockdowns and shelter in place measures heightened risk of children witnessing or suffering domestic violence and abuse . Use of online platforms for distance learning has increased risk of exposure to inappropriate content and online predators , and risks to child mental health and well - being are also considerable ( www . un . org ) . Although data collected from contact - tracing and population studies indicated that children and adolescents are less susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 infection when compared to adults , as shown in a recent meta - analysis , 1 the contribution of children to viral spread is still under debate . In fact , given the typically mild clinical course of COVID - 19 in younger age , 2 , 3 symptoms - based testing may have underestimated infection in children , and unrecognized viral circulation may still occur at school , potentially raising community infection rates . .

In our analysis , we included studies on point prevalence to assess the potential extent of unrecognized viral positivity in students , serosurveys to estimate the silent circulation of SARS - CoV - 2 in schools , and studies on contact tracing to determine the infectivity and susceptibility of students and school staff exposed to the virus . METHODS Search strategy and selection criteria We included any original study ( article , communication , report ) , peer - reviewed publications or pre - prints , which reported a quantitative estimation of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the school setting . We excluded reviews , meta - analyses and modeling studies . Studies performed in special settings were included in the systematic review but excluded from the meta - analysis . We planned and conducted a systematic literature search and review following MOOSE guidelines regarding meta - analysis of observational studies . We performed a systematic literature review using validated search strategies from these databases : (cid:129) PUBMED ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / entrez / query . fcgi ) (cid:129) Ovid MEDLINE database (cid:129) ISI Web of Science : Science Citation Index Expanded ( SCI Expanded ) and Living Evidence on COVID database ( https : / / zika . ispm . unibe . ch / assets / data / pub / search _ beta / ) to identify papers on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the educational setting ( Flow - chart Figure 1 ) . The search was undertaken during the first week of April , 2021 , and repeated on May , 15 th 2021 . We used the search terms “screening ( or point prevalence ) ” , “serosurvey ( or seroprevalence ) ” and “contact tracing” combined with “school ( or education ) , children” . For PUBMED searches we also limited the search to [ age : birth - 18y ] and added the term “COVID ( or COVID - 19 , or SARS - CoV - .

No language restriction was applied . The searches yielded a total of 1088 publications . After screening of titles and abstracts , and removal of duplicates , 35 publications were selected for full - text review . After full - text review , six studies were deemed not eligible for the meta - analysis , and five additional studies were identified after search of cited references in eligible publications . Finally , seven national and regional reports SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the educational setting fulfilling inclusion criteria were identified and included in the meta - analysis . Data were extracted and cross - checked independently by two investigators . The following information from the published papers was extracted and coded : publication type , country , size of the country , region , study period , study setting , study design , exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 , test method , test sample , number of subjects tested and testing positive in each category ( students or staff ) , as well as proportions of positive subjects with 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) and confounders adjusted for . In addition , number , age and definition of index cases and their contacts was collected for contact tracing studies . This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - analyses ( PRISMA ) reporting guideline . Methodological quality of included studies was assessed based on a critical appraisal checklist for prevalence studies ( The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools for use in JBI Systematic Reviews ) . Data analysis Inclusion criteria : ( 1 ) The study contains the minimum information necessary to obtain the percentages of positive subjects , or data to calculate risk estimates , by type of index case , and corresponding 95 % CI ( i . e . , odds ratios or relative risks and a measure of uncertainty : standard errors , variance , confidence intervals or exact P - value of the significance of the estimates ) ; ( 2 ) The study is based on independent data to avoid giving double weight to a single study . In case of multiple reports of the same study , we considered the estimates from the most recent publication . .

In case of zero cases Haldane - Anscombe correction was used . All measures of association and the corresponding CI were translated into log relative risk , and corresponding variance , with the formula proposed by Greenland et al . 8 We used random effects models , taking into account between - study and within - study variability when more than one estimate from a single study was used . Summary Odd Ratio ( SOR ) was obtained from maximum likelihood estimate : PROC MIXED in SAS , taking into account the model when more estimates were obtained from a single study . Homogeneity of effects across studies was assessed using the Chi - square statistic and quantified by I 2 , which represents the percentage of total variation across studies that is attributable to heterogeneity rather than chance . 9 We obtained the SOR pooling the study - specific estimates by random effects models . A funnel - plot - based approach was used for assessing publication bias evaluating regression of log ( OR ) on the sample size , weighted by the inverse of the variance , as suggested by Macaskill et al . 10 To assess the influence of possible sources of bias , we considered the STROBE ( Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ) checklist proposed for observational epidemiologic studies . 11 According to the STROBE checklist , using meta - regression , we evaluated factors influencing between - study heterogeneity . We also examine changes in results after exclusion of specific studies to evaluate the stability of the pooled estimates . Sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate whether results were influenced by single studies . All the statistical analyses were performed using SAS software ( SAS Institute Inc . , Cary , NC ; version 9 . 4 ) and R software , version 4 . 0 . 2 ( http : / / www . r - project . org ) . Two - sided P - value less than 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . RESULTS SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rates in educational settings ( screening studies ) .

( which was not certified by peer review ) The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted September 7 , 2021 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2021 . 09 . 03 . 21263088 doi : medRxiv preprint 8 We identified 21 studies that reported data on SARS - CoV - 2 infections in diverse educational settings , from kindergartens and daycares to primary and high schools ( eTable 1 in the Supplement ) , 12 – 29 involving more than 120 , 000 subjects . Fifteen studies were from Europe , 12 , 13 , 15 – 17 , 19 – 24 , 27 , 29 , 30 five from US , 16 , 18 , 25 , 26 , 28 one from Israel . 14 Overall , studies documented SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rates from the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 until May 2021 , including periods of low and high community transmission . Screening campaigns were organized by schools as part of mitigation measures to prevent introduction of SARS - CoV - 2 in their premises or by local and national authorities to monitor viral circulation among students , teachers , and non - teaching staff . Testing involved asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic participants , providing an indication of otherwise possibly unrecognized viral spread within educational settings . The vast majority of the studies were judged of high quality ( 80 % , eTable 4 ) . The summary estimate of positivity rate assessed through implementation of the different screening methods was 0 . 44 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 13 - 0 . 92 % ) , with high heterogeneity ( I 2 = 97 % , Figure 2a ) . The difference in estimates between cross - sectional and cohort studies was significant ( p = 0 . 03 ) with a remarkable lower prevalence among cross - sectional studies ( 0 . 31 % , 95 % CI 0 . 05 - 0 . 81 % ) compared to cohort studies ( 1 . 14 % , 95 % CI 0 . 01 - 4 . 19 % ) ( Table 1 ) . Fifteen studies reported SARS - CoV - 2 point prevalence in a total of 112 , 131 subjects , 12 – 23 , 30 – 32 including one study providing data collected during two rounds of testing within the COVID - 19 Schools Infection Survey . 23 A total of 326 coronavirus infections were detected . Overall , estimated positivity rate was 0 . 31 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 05 - 0 . 81 % ) , with high heterogeneity among studies ( I 2 = 95 % , Table 1 ) . Highest infections rates were reported in the two rounds of testing performed in England in November and December 2020 , especially among high school students and staff 23 . Excluding reports not published in peer reviewed journals , the summary estimate of positivity rate was slightly greater , 0 . 40 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 05 - 1 . 07 % ) , but still below 1 % . .

Overall , estimated positivity rate was 1 . 14 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 01 - 4 . 19 % ) , with high heterogeneity among studies ( I 2 = 98 % , Table 1 ) . Highest number of cases were detected in the study of Crowe and colleagues , 28 who identified 46 infections in 773 asymptomatic staff and students ( 5 . 6 % ) from three schools engaged in a pilot program with weekly testing over a 5 - week period in November 2020 in Omaha , US . Bi - weekly testing led to identification of 25 cases out of 1180 participants ( 2 . 1 % ) over 3 - month period in the study held by Volpp and colleagues in New Jersey , US ( 15 - 22 samples collected on average from each participant , for a total of 21 , 449 test performed ) , 26 while only 1 case out of 5210 participants ( 0 . 02 % ) was detected in a 4 - week study performed in Dusseldorf , Germany ( 34 . 068 tested samples , up to 8 tests per subject ) . 24 Two rounds of testing one week apart identified one case out of 701 participants in Swiss students and staff participating to Ciao corona study , 29 while 16 samples tested positive out of the 3431 collected from 1251 students and staff ( 1 . 3 % positive subjects ) of two schools in Rome , Italy , over a 3 - month period . Finally , Gillespie and colleagues reported the experience of two US schools that implemented strong mitigation measures for re - opening , 25 including weekly testing for students and staff . Here , nine rounds of universal testing led to identification of 81 SARS - CoV - 2 infected individuals out of the 3720 participants ( 2 . 2 % ) , with additional 23 infections identified through contact tracing and 33 self - reported COVID - 19 cases . Nine cross - sectional studies 13 , 15 – 18 , 20 , 23 , 31 and five cohort studies reported infections detected in children and in adults separately , 24 , 26 – 29 including one reporting estimates for two rounds of testing ( eTable 1 in the Supplement ) . 23 Children and adults showed comparable SARS - CoV - 2 positivity rates in most studies , and the pooled OR estimate was 0 . 83 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 53 - 1 . 29 ) , with low .

We found an indication for publication bias ( P = 0 . 03 ) . Similar results were observed in cross - sectional studies ( pooled OR = 0 . 98 ; 95 % CI 0 . 74 - 1 . 32 , I 2 = 23 % ) , and cohort studies ( pooled OR = 0 . 62 ; 95 % CI 0 . 20 - 1 . 94 , I 2 = 4 % ) ( Table 1 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in educational settings ( serosurveys ) We identified 9 studies that reported data on SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence in educational settings providing in - person activities , 14 , 15 , 30 , 33 – 38 with a total of 17 , 879 subjects involved ( eTable 2 in the Supplement ) . All studies were performed in Europe during 2020 . While the above - described point prevalence cross - sectional studies inform on the rates of current infections , cross - sectional serosurveys inform on cumulative exposure to the virus for tested participants . We also identified three cohort studies assessing prevalence of antibodies for SARS - CoV - 2 at different time points , with participants tested twice to examine longitudinal changes of seroprevalence , 36 – 38 and we included the most recent testing in our metanalysis . The majority of the studies were judged of high quality ( 70 % , eTable 5 ) . The overall seropositive rate was 3 . 9 % ( 95 % CI 1 . 15 - 8 . 19 % ) , with high heterogeneity among studies ( I 2 = 100 % , Figure 3a ) . The difference in estimates between cross - sectional and cohort studies was statistically significant ( p = 0 . 005 ) , with estimates obtained from cohort studies indicating a 10 % of positivity ( 10 . 3 % ; 95 % CI 2 . 43 - 22 . 7 % ) and a lower prevalence of 1 . 5 % from cross - sectional studies ( 1 . 49 % , 95 % CI 0 . 07 - 4 . 69 % ) ( Table 1 ) . Six studies were performed during the first semester of 2020 and assessed antibodies during or shortly after the first wave of the pandemic , 14 , 15 , 30 , 34 , 35 including three studies focused on attendant to schools and daycares that remained exceptionally open during national lockdowns . 14 , 33 , 35 Although the seroprevalence differed among the three studies , authors reported comparable seroprevalence in groups of children not attending school ( 0 . 5 % versus 1 % , and 1 . 4 % versus 2 . 7 % , respectively , for children attending in - person , or staying at home ) , 14 , 33 and adults who did not have occupational contact with children or COVID - 19 - positive patients ( 7 . 7 % for daycare staff and 5 . 5 % .

In line with these observations , low seroprevalence reported in three additional cross - sectional studies adds up to the indication that schools did not develop into silent hotspots for viral transmission during the first wave of the pandemic , 15 , 30 , 34 likely due to the successful implementation of extensive preventive measures . In this regard , it is noteworthy mentioning two studies reporting seroprevalence in students from a small city in north France and from a large community school in Santiago , Chile . 39 , 40 In both cases , school - based COVID - 19 outbreaks occurred at the very onset of the pandemic and in the absence of preventive measures , leading to 38 . 1 % and 43 . 4 % seropositive pupils and teachers , respectively , in one French high school , 39 and 9 . 9 % and 16 . 6 % seropositive students and staff in the Chilean study . 40 In the three cohort studies , 36 – 38 increased seroprevalence was recorded during the second study visit , which took place after the summer break , 36 or in December 2020 . 37 , 38 In their study , Ulyte and colleagues reported that SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence raised from 3 % in the summer to 4 . 5 % in late autumn in school children in the canton of Zurich , Switzerland . 36 Interestingly , among the children who participated to both testing rounds , 28 / 70 ( 40 % ) who were initially seropositive became seronegative , while seroconversion ( previously seronegative participants who became seropositive ) was 5 % ( 109 / 2153 ) . The estimated rate of ever - positive children was therefore 7 . 8 % . 36 Serial blood sampling was also implemented in a secondary school in Dresden , Germany . 37 Here , antibody positivity rates increased from 1 . 7 % to 6 . 8 % during the 6 - week study period , and all the participants who tested positive at the initial visit ( 5 / 5 ) remained positive at the second visit . Lastly , data collected within the COVID - 19 Schools Infection Survey showed high initial antibody positivity rates , consistent with the study designed to oversample schools in areas of England where coronavirus infection was highest at the start of the academic year ( September 2020 ) , and a not significant increase in pupils ( 7 . 7 % to 9 % and 11 % to 13 . 5 % for primary and secondary school , respectively ) and staff ( 12 . 5 % to 15 % ) testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies between .

In this study , 7 . 3 % ( 20 / 276 ) of staff who initially tested positive , had no detectable antibodies in the second round . Separate seroprevalence estimates for children and adults were available for six studies ( eTable 2 in the Supplement ) . 14 , 15 , 33 , 37 , 38 , 41 School - aged children had lower antibody positivity rates when compared with adults ( parents or school staff ) in 4 / 6 studies ( Figure 3b ) . The pooled OR for children was 0 . 57 ( 95 % CI 0 . 49 - 0 . 68 ) , significantly lower than adults , with low heterogeneity among studies ( I 2 = 21 % ) . No indication for publication bias was found ( P = 0 . 42 ) . Onward transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in educational settings ( contact tracing ) Studies analyzing onward transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 offered the possibility to test more specifically the infectivity and susceptibility to infection of children linked to educational settings . We identified 15 studies that reported data on transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in schools with available information on the number of contacts of index cases ( eTable 3 in the Supplement ) . 14 , 42 – 53 Six studies were from Europe , 43 , 45 , 47 , 50 , 51 , 54 five from USA , 41 , 48 , 49 , 52 , 53 two from Israel , 14 , 46 one each from South Korea and Australia . 42 , 44 A total of 112 , 622 contacts of children and adults who were physically present at school while positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , were identified . Molecular testing for SARS - CoV - 2 was normally offered to all contacts exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 , except for one study 48 . In this study , only symptomatic contacts were tested , so asymptomatic secondary cases were not captured . The majority of the studies were judged of high quality ( 60 % , eTable 6 ) . When considering any - age index cases , and their contacts of any age , the pooled secondary attack rate ( SAR ) was 2 . 54 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 76 - 5 . 31 % ) , with high heterogeneity among studies ( I 2 = 100 % , Figure 4a ) . The highest attack rate ( 13 . 5 % ) was recorded within a large outbreak in a high school in Jerusalem , Israel linked to two student index cases and likely promoted by inadequate preventive measures ( crowded classes , exemption from facemasks and continuous air - conditioning due to an extreme heatwave ) . 46 High attack rates were recorded also in two US - based studies , both reporting .

Doyle and colleagues investigated COVID - 19 in primary and secondary schools in Florida during the first semester of school reopening . 49 Of the 63 , 654 of COVID - 19 cases registered between August and December 2020 in school - aged children , 60 % were not school - related , and < 1 % of registered students were identified as having school - related COVID - 19 . Contact tracing investigations identified 86 , 832 persons who had close school setting contact with these cases ; among these , 37 , 548 received testing and 10 , 092 received a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test result , leading to 11 . 6 % secondary attack rate . Prospective investigation of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission was also performed in a Georgia school district during a period of peak community COVID - 19 incidence . 52 Tracing of 86 index cases identified 1 , 005 contacts , of whom 644 were tested and 59 received a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test result ( SAR = 5 . 9 % ) . Highest SAR were identified in the setting of indoor sports and staff interactions . On the other hand , extremely low attack rates ( < 1 % ) were found in five studies reporting from five nations and two continents and describing transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in school setting from the early onset of the pandemic ( one pediatric case among the first reported cases in France who visited three schools and one ski class while infected , generated 172 contacts and one secondary case ) until November 2020 . 43 Similar results were found in the study conducted in Italy during the second wave , September to November 2020 55 . Secondary infections at school were < 1 % and secondary infections among teachers were rare , occurring more frequently when the index case was a teacher than a student ( 37 % vs . 10 % , P = 0 . 007 ) . Three studies reported on viral transmission from young ( age < 18y ) or adult index cases ( eTable 3 in the Supplement ) . 42 , 52 , 54 In all studies , the proportion of contacts infected by young index cases was lower compared to adult index cases ( Figure 4b ) .

No indication for publication bias was found ( P = 0 . 65 ) . Discussion The findings of this systematic review and meta - analysis suggest that schools did not develop into hotspots for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Although infection can and does occur in schools , more than 1 - year experience with in - person schooling worldwide indicates limited viral spread when mitigation measures are adopted , with low SARS - CoV - 2 circulation and scarce child - to - adult transmission in the school setting . Reviewing the experience of different schools showed that health behavioral policies realized before the vaccination , seem to mitigate the risk of viral spread in educational settings . In particular contact tracing is very useful to promptly isolate infected staff and students . We found five times greater frequency of positive tests with contact tracing compared to screening and these results suggests that testing all subjects in schools , independently of symptoms , probably not help in reducing clusters . Finally , it would be pivotal to prioritize teachers and educational support staff in COVID - 19 vaccine rollout , especially older people and subjects with chronic diseases , to protect teachers’ and students’ health and safety . Engagement of all stakeholders ( school staff members , students , and their parents or legal guardians ) into implementation of school - based policies , as well as individual adherence to shared recommendations are key for minimizing COVID - 19 transmission chain .
