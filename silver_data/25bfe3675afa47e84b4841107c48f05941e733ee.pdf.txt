All rights reserved . DOI 10 . 1016 / j . ceb . 2010 . 10 . 005 Introduction Plasma membrane , the lipid bilayer separating cytoplasm from extracellular milieu , undergoes dynamic morpho - logical changes during several cellular processes such as migration , morphogenesis , and endocytosis . The force for the formation of membrane protrusions and invagina - tions is produced by the coordinated polymerization of actin ﬁlaments against the plasma membrane . The organ - ization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are regulated by a plethora of actin - binding proteins to ensure that actin ﬁlaments are assembled and disas - sembled at desired locations and time , and to orient the rapidly growing actin ﬁlament barbed ends toward the membrane [ 1 ] . The activities of various actin - binding proteins are regulated by Rho family small GTPases , which induce the formation of speciﬁc actin ﬁlament assemblies in cells [ 2 ] . In addition , membrane phospho - lipids , especially PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , regulate the activities of many actin - binding proteins . Typically , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 acti - vates those actin - binding proteins that promote ﬁlament assembly and inhibits those that suppress actin polymer - ization or promote ﬁlament disassembly , thus leading to increased actin ﬁlament assembly at PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich mem - branes [ 3 ] . During the past decade , it has become evident that certain actin - associated proteins can also directly regulate the shape and lipid organization of the plasma membrane . These so - called membrane deforming proteins include for example the Bin - amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) superfamily proteins , dynamin and epsin , which induce either positive or negative membrane curvature both in vitro and in cells . Interestingly , generation of membrane curvature by these membrane deforming proteins often works together with actin dynamics . Thus , at least during endocytosis , both actin polymerization and direct membrane deformation by BAR superfamily proteins and dynamin are essential for the invagination and scission of the endocytic vesicles [ 4 – 7 ] . Generation of positive membrane curvature by BAR and F - BAR domain proteins The BAR domain was originally identiﬁed as a conserved protein module that is present in mammalian proteins B in1 and a mphiphysin , and in budding yeast R vs167 protein [ 8 ] . Subsequent studies revealed that amphiphy - sin is linked to membrane dynamics in animals and that its N - terminal BAR domain can induce membrane tubu - lation in vitro [ 9 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 10 ] . The crystal structure of the amphi - physin BAR domain revealed a ‘banana’ shaped a - helical dimer that binds negatively charged membranes through its concave surface , thus providing a structural expla - nation for why BAR domains induce positive membrane curvature [ 11 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Subsequently , a larger membrane deforming protein module was identiﬁed from many proteins that had been previously linked to membrane / cytoskeletal dynamics [ 11 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 12 (cid:2) , 13 (cid:2) ] . Because this new protein module was an extended version of the previously identiﬁed Fes / CIP4 homology ( FCH ) domain [ 14 ] , it was named the F - BAR domain [ 12 (cid:2) ] . Also the F - BAR domain is a ‘banana’ shaped dimer , but it is more extended and displays shallower curvature compared to canonical BAR domains . This explains why the membrane tubules induced by F - BAR domains display typically larger Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2011 , 23 : 14 – 21 www . sciencedirect . com diameter compared to the ones generated by more strongly curved BAR domains [ 15 (cid:2) , 16 (cid:2) ] . The BAR and F - BAR domains drive the formation of positive membrane curvature and , as cytoplasmic proteins , the full - length BAR / F - BAR domain proteins are typically involved in the formation of plasma mem - brane invaginations . During clathrin - mediated endocyto - sis , F - BAR domain proteins typically arrive early to the site of endocytosis , and may be involved in the nucleation of clathrin - coated pits [ 17 , 18 , 19 (cid:2) ] . BAR domain proteins , on the other hand , are often recruited to endocytic sites later , and may thus be involved in the elongation / stabil - ization of endocytic invaginations [ 5 ] . At least in budding yeast , where dynamins are not present , BAR domain proteins may also promote scission of the endosome from the plasma membrane [ 20 ] . Generation of negative membrane curvature by I - BAR domains The Inverse BAR ( I - BAR ) domain was originally ident - iﬁed as a protein module at the N - terminal region of m issing - i n - m etastasis ( MIM ) and i nsulin r eceptor tyrosine kinase s ubstrate p53 ( IRSp53 ) proteins , and hence origin - ally called the IM ( I RSp53 / M IM ) domain . When expressed in cells , this domain induces the formation of ﬁlopodium - like plasma membrane protrusions . This was proposed to be due to actin ﬁlament bundling activity of the domain [ 21 ] . However , subsequent studies revealed that this domain does not display strong actin ﬁlament binding / bundling activity at physiological salt conditions , but instead binds phosphoinositide - rich vesicles with high afﬁnity [ 22 (cid:2) ] . The IRSp53 and MIM I - BAR domains are a - helical antiparallel dimers , which display remote structural homology to BAR and F - BAR domains [ 23 (cid:2) , 24 (cid:2) ] . However , in contrast to the banana - shaped BAR and F - BAR domains , the I - BAR domain is a zeppelin - shaped structure ( Figure 1 ) . Importantly , I - BAR domains not only bind phosphoinosi - tide - rich membranes , but also deform them to tubular structures [ 22 (cid:2) , 25 (cid:2) , 26 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . However , in contrast to the BAR and F - BAR domains , the I - BAR domains bind to the inner leaﬂet of the membrane tubule through a lipid binding surface that displays convex geometry , thus generating negative membrane curvature . This explains why I - BAR domains induce plasma membrane protru - sions rather than invaginations in cells [ 22 (cid:2) , 26 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . In addition to bending membranes , I - BAR domains modu - late their lipid organization by inducing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 cluster - ing [ 26 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . In contrast to other PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clustering proteins , such as ADF / coﬁlins [ 27 ] , I - BAR domains induce large , microscopic scale PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clusters , possibly through oligomerization of the domain at the membrane [ 26 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Thus , it is possible that I - BAR domains form similar helical oligomers to the ones previously reported for F - BAR domains on membranes [ 28 (cid:2) ] . Five I - BAR domain proteins IRSp53 , MIM , IRTKS ( insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate ; also known as BAIAP2L1 ) , ABBA ( actin - bundling protein with BAIAP2 homology ) , and FLJ22582 ( BAIAP2L2 ) are pre - sent in mammals ( Figure 2 ) . All currently characterized members of the family IRSp53 , MIM , IRTKS , and ABBA are involved in the formation of plasma membrane pro - trusions , such as ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia [ 29 ] . Besides the I - BAR domain , they contain several protein – protein interaction modules ( Figure 2 ) . The C - terminus of most I - BAR domain proteins contains an actin monomer bind - ing W ASP - h omology 2 ( WH2 ) domain , suggesting that they function at the interface of plasma membrane and actin dynamics . Additionally , an SH3 domain is present in IRSp53 , IRTKS , and FLJ22582 . The SH3 domain of IRSp53 binds proline - rich sequences of many regulators of actin dynamics , such as WAVE - 2 , Mena , and Eps8 [ 30 – 32 ] . IRSp53 also interacts with the small GTPase Cdc42 through its CRIB domain , and MIM binds the actin - regulatory protein cortactin through its proline - rich region , further linking these membrane deforming proteins to the actin cytoskeleton [ 31 , 33 , 34 ] . Collabora - tive activity of the membrane deforming I - BAR domain with the protein – protein interaction motifs in the context of full - length I - BAR domain proteins can thus be viewed as an integrating node for recruiting different actin - regulatory machineries to generate distinct membrane protrusions in cells . Physiological and pathological roles of I - BAR domain proteins IRSp53 This protein was originally identiﬁed in a screen for substrates of insulin and insulin - like growth factor 1 [ 35 ] . IRSp53 is involved in the formation of ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia in cultured mesenchymal cells [ 36 – 38 ] and it contributes to assembly / maintenance of tight junc - tions in cultured epithelial cells [ 39 ] . IRSp53 appears to promote ﬁlopodium formation in complexes with small GTPase Cdc42 and actin bundling / capping protein Eps8 , while it may promote lamellipodia formation as a com - ponent of the actin nucleating WAVE complex [ 29 ] . IRSp53 binds Rac through its I - BAR domain and to WAVE through its SH3 and thus contributes to membrane rufﬂing [ 30 ] . In addition , IRSp53 binds Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 , which enhances its binding to active Rac and WAVE - 2 . Moreover , Tiam1 promotes IRSp53 localization to Rac - induced lamellipodia rather than Cdc42 - induced ﬁlopodia [ 40 ] . IRSp53 is also regulated by phosphorylation of two threonine residues that promote interactions with 14 - 3 - 3 protein and consequent inactivation of IRSp53 [ 41 ] . IRSp53 is widely expressed in different tissues and cell - types in mammals , and it is especially abundant in neurons . Accordingly , IRSp53 knockout mice display I - BAR domain proteins Zhao , Pyka¨la¨inen and Lappalainen 15 www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2011 , 23 : 14 – 21 defects in learning , memory and synaptic plasticity . Furthermore , certain IRSp53 alleles in humans have been linked to neurological problems such as attention - deﬁcit / hyperactivity disorder [ 42 – 44 ] . Dendritic spine density was reduced in cultured neurons by RNAi - mediated knockdown of IRSp53 and the dendritic development was retarded in the neurons derived from IRSp53 knock - out mice [ 43 , 45 ] . However , no signiﬁcant changes in the density or ultrastructural morphology of dendritic spines was observed in the brain of IRSp53 (cid:3) / (cid:3) knockout mice , 16 Cell structure and dynamics Figure 1 Membrane deformation by BAR domains . Canonical BAR domains and most F - BAR domains induce positive membrane curvature because their membrane - binding interfaces display concave geometry . In contrast , the membrane - binding sites of I - BAR domains have convex geometry , and thus they induce negative membrane curvature . Electrostatic surface potentials of the domains are indicated with blue as positive and red as negative . Amphiphysin ( 1URU ) , CIP4 ( 2EFK ) , and IRSp53 ( 1Y2O ) are shown as representative examples of BAR , F - BAR , and I - BAR domains , respectively . Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2011 , 23 : 14 – 21 www . sciencedirect . com and thus additional studies are required to reveal the possible role of IRSp53 in dendritic ﬁlopodia formation [ 42 ] . Importantly , lens - retina inter - epithelial ﬁlopodium formation is defective in IRSp53 knockout mice , provid - ing evidence that this protein promotes ﬁlopodium for - mation also in vivo [ 46 ] . IRTKS Compared to IRSp53 , its closest relative IRTKS is expressed only at low levels in the brain , but is present in bladder , liver , testes , heart , and lungs . Also the cellular role of IRTKS appears to be somewhat different from the one of IRSp53 , because IRTKS binds small GTPase Rac rather than Cdc42 . When expressed in cells , IRTKS induced clusters of short actin bundles rather than ﬁlo - podia [ 47 ] . However , the exact cellular / physiological function of IRTKS remains to be identiﬁed through knockout / knockdown approaches . Interestingly , both IRSp53 and IRTKS have been linked to the formation of actin - rich membrane protrusions , called pedestals , during the infection process of enterohemorrhagic Escher - ichia coli bacterium [ 48 , 49 ] . MIM MIM was originally identiﬁed as an mRNA fragment whose expression is downregulated in metastatic balled cancer cell lines [ 50 ] . However , more recent studies demonstrated that , although MIM is downregulated in certain epithelial tumors , its expression is elevated in other metastatic cancers [ 51 ] . During development , MIM is strongly expressed in the heart , skeletal muscle , and central nervous system . In adult mice , MIM is expressed at high levels in liver , kidney , and in the cerebellar Purkinje cells [ 52 ] . Over expression of MIM in cultured mammalian cells results in the disappearance of actin stress ﬁbers and formation of microspikes and membrane rufﬂes , suggesting that this protein is involved in the formation of plasma membrane protrusions [ 53 ] . MIM undergoes Src - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation at a central region of the protein ( outside the I - BAR domain ) . Mutation of these tyrosines led to a reduced dorsal ruf - ﬂing by MIM , indicating the importance of MIM phos - phorylation in actin remodeling [ 54 ] . Recently , MIM was also proposed to contribute to sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) signaling by regulating ciliogenesis and by enhancing Gli - mediated transcription through direct interactions with Gli1 and Gli2 transcription factors [ 55 , 56 ] . However , despite the wealth of biochemical and cell biological data , the exact cellular role and the function of this membrane deforming protein in animal development / physiology are currently not known . ABBA ABBA is the closest homologue of MIM , and these two proteins display very similar domain structures to each other . In mice , ABBA is strongly expressed especially in the central nervous system , where the protein is abundant in certain glial cells , but absent in neurons . Endogenous ABBA localizes at the interface of the cortical actin cytoskeleton and plasma membrane in cultured C6 - R glial cells , and its depletion by RNAi leads to defects in lamellipodial dynamics and process extension . The membrane deforming I - BAR domain is essential for these processes , suggesting that membrane curvature sensing / generation by ABBA plays an important role in lamelli - podial dynamics in these cells [ 57 ] . Furthermore , ABBA binds the small GTPase Rac1 through its I - BAR domain and promotes PDGF - mediated membrane rufﬂing by activating Rac1 [ 58 ] . Invertebrate I - BAR domain proteins I - BAR domain proteins are also present in lower eukar - yotes such as invertebrates and Dictyostelium slime mold , but they are not found in yeasts ( which because of the presence of the cell wall are not believed to make plasma membrane protrusions ) [ 29 ] . From these , the single Cae - norhabditis elegans I - BAR domain was shown to bind and deform PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich membranes similarly to mamma - lian I - BAR domains [ 26 ] . Genetic studies on the Droso - phila I - BAR domain protein , named dMIM , revealed that it plays an important role in the directional migration of border cells in the ovary , and proposed that I - BAR domain proteins and canonical BAR domain proteins may display antagonistic effects on endocytosis [ 59 ] . srGAP2 Slit - robo GTPase activating proteins ( srGAPs ) form a family of RhoGAP proteins , which mediate slit - robo I - BAR domain proteins Zhao , Pyka¨la¨inen and Lappalainen 17 Figure 2 Domain structures of mammalian I - BAR domain proteins . I - BAR : I - BAR domain , WH2 : WH2 domain , SH3 : SH3 domain , PPPP : proline - rich region , Serine rich : serine - rich region , CRIB : CRIB domain , and WWB : WW binding domain . www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2011 , 23 : 14 – 21 signaling in axon guidance and cell migration . The mam - malian srGAP family consists of three members , srGAP1 - 3 , which are composed of F - BAR , RhoGAP , and SH3 domains [ 60 ] . Interestingly , similarly to the I - BAR domains , the F - BAR domain of srGAP2 / ARHGAP14 promotes the formation of plasma membrane protrusions in cells and generates negative membrane curvature in vitro . The srGAP2 protein , and its isolated F - BAR domain , induced leading process branching to regulate neuronal migration during cortical development in mice . These data suggest that the F - BAR domain may be a more versatile regulator of membrane dynamics than previously considered [ 61 (cid:2) ] . Do I - BAR domain proteins sense or generate membrane curvature in cells ? Isolated I - BAR domains deform PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich mem - branes to tubular structures . However , whether the func - tion of I - BAR domain in the context of endogenous full - length proteins is to generate or sense membrane curvature is an open question . If these proteins sense membrane curvature , the I - BAR domain would only be required to localize the full - length protein to the regions of negative membrane curvature in cells . The membrane - bound I - BAR domain protein would subsequently recruit the actin polymerization machinery to these sites through its other protein motifs . This would lead to actin ﬁlament assembly and consequent formation of membrane protru - sions ( Figure 3a ) . Alternatively , these proteins can actively generate membrane curvature through their I - BAR domains , and the direct membrane deformation together with actin polymerization could efﬁciently induce formation of plasma membrane protrusions in cells ( Figure 3b ) . Recent studies demonstrated that I - BAR domain - induced membrane deformation can create a small and transient space at ﬁlopodial tips that is subsequently ﬁlled with actin ﬁlaments [ 62 ] , and provided evidence that I - BAR domains form an oligomeric structure to induce 18 Cell structure and dynamics Figure 3 Membrane curvature sensing versus generation by I - BAR domain proteins . ( a ) In the case of membrane curvature sensing , the I - BAR domain localizes the full - length protein to the site of negative membrane curvature in cells . The membrane - bound I - BAR domain proteins subsequently recruit the actin polymerization machinery to these sites through their other protein – protein interaction motifs . This leads to actin filament assembly and consequent formation of membrane protrusions . ( b ) Alternatively , I - BAR domain proteins can directly generate membrane curvature through their I - BAR domains . Synergy between the direct membrane deformation and actin polymerization would efficiently induce the formation of desired plasma membrane protrusions in cells . Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2011 , 23 : 14 – 21 www . sciencedirect . com membrane tubulation [ 26 ] . These data suggest that also in cells the function of this domain is to actively deform membranes . This is further supported by the study pro - posing that the I - BAR domain of MIM , which generates negative membrane curvature , actually senses positive membrane curvature through inserting an amphipathic helix into the membrane [ 63 ] . On the other hand , full - length I - BAR domain proteins generally promote the formation of less extensive membrane protrusions , such as microspikes and membrane rufﬂes in cells [ 47 , 52 , 53 , 57 ] , indicating that they either sense membrane curvature and / or promote the formation of smaller mem - brane protrusions than the isolated I - BAR domains . It is possible that the membrane curvature sensing / gener - ation is highly dependent on the local concentration of the activated I - BAR domain proteins in cells . At low concentrations , I - BAR domain proteins would mainly function as membrane curvature sensors and the WH2 and SH3 domains ( or proline - rich regions ) of these proteins could recruit the actin nucleation and polymer - ization machinery to promote the actual generation of membrane curvature . However , when the local concen - tration of the active I - BAR domain protein is high , I - BAR domains alone could be sufﬁcient to generate membrane curvature by forming oligomeric structures beneath the membrane . This would lead to the formation of ﬁlopo - dium / microspike - like structures in cells . It is also import - ant to note that the two functions , membrane curvature sensing and generation , are not mutually exclusive . Thus , in cells both mechanisms may act simultaneously to efﬁciently promote the formation of plasma membrane protrusions . Conclusions and future perspectives I - BAR domain proteins generate negative membrane curvature through their N - terminal membrane deforming domains , and interact with actin and regulators of actin dynamics through their other domains . Thus , these proteins are involved in the formation of plasma mem - brane protrusions . From mammalian I - BAR domain proteins , at least MIM and IRSp53 are involved in cell migration and invasion . In the future , it will be important to reveal the mechanism by which these proteins , together with their interaction partners , link actin and plasma membrane dynamics in these processes , and to elucidate how the activities of these proteins are regulated in cells . Furthermore , the importance of I - BAR domain proteins , and other proteins capable of generating negative membrane curvature , in the for - mation of thin ﬁlopodium - like protrusions and / or in the stabilization of these structures needs to be resolved . Certain cell - types contain also other , more stable , thin plasma membrane protrusions called cytonemes and tun - neling nanotubes . These long plasma membrane protru - sions are involved in the cell – cell communication and in the cell - to - cell transmission of retroviruses [ 64 ] . Because the diameters of these membrane tubules are close to the ones induced by I - BAR domains in vitro , it will be interesting to examine the possible roles of I - BAR domain proteins in the formation and stabilization of these struc - tures . Although I - BAR domains were shown to generate nega - tive membrane curvature and to induce the formation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 clusters in vitro [ 26 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] , the roles of interdomain interactions of I - BAR domains and hence the exact structural mechanism of the I - BAR domain - induced membrane deformation are not known . We also do not know how I - BAR domains affect the dynamics ( = lateral diffusion ) of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in these structures , and what is the possible biological role of this phosphoinositide clustering in various cellular processes . Finally , it will be important to reveal how the I - BAR domain - induced membrane tubules , which represent the energetically favorable state of this protein domain and the lipid bilayer , are disas - sembled in cells to maintain plasma membrane dynamics .
