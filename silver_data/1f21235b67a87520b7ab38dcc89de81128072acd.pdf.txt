S . Although children experience lower rates of severe symptoms and have higher rates of asymptomatic infection as compared to adults , the mental health of children is more vulnerable than that of older individuals ( Loades et al . , 2020 ) . Although some studies reported mental health outcomes of the general children during the pandemic ( Duan et al . , 2020 ) , evidence regarding mental health of children infected by COVID - 19 are largely understudied . Children or adolescents infected with COVID - 19 may experience a series of physical symptoms—often including fever and respiratory distress . Previous studies showed that children might experience trauma , poor sleep , and withdrawn behaviors during the pandemic ( Douglas et al . , 2009 ) . In the COVID - 19 pandemic , cluster infection is more likely to occur within the families of infected children ( Dong et al . , 2020 ) , which increases the risk of parental infections— possibly leading to a lack of mental and emotional support from the child’s parents ( Holmes et al . , 2020 ) . It is possible that children infected by COVID - 19 may experience similar psychological problems . Due to the large number of infected children worldwide , it is urgent to know the emotional and mental health outcomes of infected children . To the best of our knowledge , no studies have yet reported the prevalence of symptoms associated with anxiety , depression , and PTSD among recovered , pediatric COVID - 19 patients . There is also a dearth of information regarding the risk factors associated with mental distress among pediatric patients . It is urgent for researchers to clarify these issues to better understand the mechanisms by which mental health problems develop in pediatric patients ( Prime et al . , 2020 ) . In this study , we examine the mental health outcomes of 38 pediatric patients who were admitted to the Wuhan Children’s Hospital with cases of COVID - 19 . METHODS Study Design The following study—utilizing a cross - sectional survey design—was conducted between June 30 and July 15 , 2020 and was approved by the research ethics committee in Renmin University of China on May 20 , 2020 . Following approval , nurses at the Wuhan Children’s Hospital were presented with the survey materials , which they described to the parents of candidate patients before obtaining their oral consent . Two separate online survey links were sent to the parent and child participants . The children only needed to report their gender , age , and psychological symptoms ; all other information was obtained from their parents . Liu et al . COVID - 19 Children’s Mental Health Participants Nurses reviewed the electronic medical records of all COVID - 19 patients under the age of 18 . Inclusion criteria for participants included : ( 1 ) inpatient hospitalization ; ( 2 ) symptoms consistent with COVID - 19 ; and ( 3 ) an age between 5 and 18 years . Eligible participants had all experienced a full recovery and were subsequently discharged from the hospital— with a median of 110 days since discharge ( ICQ [ 102 , 129 ] ) and an average hospital stay of 11 days ( ICQ [ 7 , 15 . 5 ] ) . The date of hospital admission ranged from January 27 , 2020 to March 28 , 2020 , and the date of discharge ranged from February 2 , 2020 to April 30 , 2020 . Nurses distributed online questionnaires to 112 patients , yielding 77 responses ; however , only 38 pairs of parents and children completed the entire questionnaire . Measures The Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders ( SCARED ) SCARED ( Birmaher et al . , 1997 , 1999 ) is a self - report questionnaire which assesses anxiety disorder symptoms in children and adolescents under the age of 18 . The scale is composed of 41 items , and children are asked to report the frequency of each symptom on a 3 - point - scale : 0 ( almost never ) , 1 ( sometimes ) , or 2 ( often ) . The reliability was 0 . 993 . The Children’s Depression Inventory ( CDI ) CDI is a widely used self - report inventory for assessing depression in school - aged children ( Saylor et al . , 1984 ) . It contains 27 items which each consist of three choices that are graded in order of increasing severity , from 0 to 2 . Children select the sentence from each group which best describes themselves during the prior two weeks period . The reliability was 0 . 954 . The UCLA Child / Adolescent PTSD Reaction Index for DSM - 5 This is the revised UCLA Child / Adolescent PTSD Reaction Index from DSM - IV ( Kaplow et al . , 2020 ) . The new version is a semi - structured interview which assesses a child’s traumatic history and the full range of DSM - 5 diagnostic criteria for PTSD among school - age children and adolescents . The reliability was 0 . 989 . Illness Severity and Symptoms The questionnaire elicited parental reports of key clinical variables , including : the severity of COVID - 19 pneumonia ( asymptomatic , mild , moderate , severe , or critically ill ) ; the date of symptom onset ; date of hospital admission ; date of discharge ; and ongoing symptoms following hospital discharge ( e . g . , cough , respiratory distress , chest pain , dizziness , fatigue , dyspnea , etc . ) . Parental Ignorance Parents were asked the extent to which they are unaware of their child’s daily activities . We constructed a brief , 5 - item parental ignorance scale for the current study ( e . g . , “I check the symptoms of my children daily” ) . The reliability was 0 . 787 . Peer Rejection Parents reported peer rejection according to the following single - item prompt : “My child was rejected by his / her friends . ” TABLE 1 | Characteristics of pediatric patients with COVID - 19 .

Analysis Strategy We performed analyses on three separate mental health outcomes : anxiety , depression , and PTSD . Descriptive statistics of demographic variables , clinical features , anxiety , depression , and PTSD are presented below .

COVID - 19 Children’s Mental Health FIGURE 1 | Age distribution of sample . regression to explore the risk factors for pediatric patients’ mental problems . Limited by the sample size , we also reported the marginally signiﬁcant results . RESULTS Demographic Proﬁle of the Sample Thirty - eight pairs of parents and children completed the survey . The median age of the child cohort was 10 years ( ICQ [ 8 , 13 ] ) and 14 ( 36 . 8 % ) of the participants were female . 24 ( 63 . 2 % ) children had at least one other family member infected with COVID - 19 , and 10 ( 26 . 3 % ) had family members die as a result of COVID - 19 infection . A comprehensive compendium of demographic information is reported in Table 1 . The age distribution can be found in Figure 1 . COVID - 19 Symptoms After Hospital Discharge A large proportion of the children suﬀered only mild ( 17 , 44 . 7 % ) or moderate ( 16 , 42 . 1 % ) symptoms . Only 3 ( 7 . 9 % ) patients were completely asymptotic , and 2 patients ( 5 . 3 % ) reported severe symptoms . Unlike adult patients , diarrhea ( 10 , 26 . 3 % ) , fatigue ( 8 , 21 . 1 % ) , and cough ( 7 , 18 . 4 % ) were the most common symptoms for children and adolescents following hospital discharge . Some symptoms which are prevalent in adult COVID - 19 patients were rare in children , including : respiratory distress ( 0 , 0 % ) , nausea ( 0 , 0 % ) , and vomiting ( 1 , 2 . 6 % ) . Additionally , some patients reported a loss of appetite ( 6 , 15 . 8 % ) and olfactory dysfunction ( 3 , 7 . 9 % ) . Descriptive Analysis of Mental Health Outcomes Seven ( 18 . 4 % ) participants were provisionally diagnosed with clinically signiﬁcant symptoms of PTSD , 12 ( 31 . 6 % ) were categorized as having signiﬁcant symptoms of anxiety , and six ( 15 . 8 % ) were categorized as having signiﬁcant symptoms of depression . The median scores for CDI , SCARED , and UCLA PTSD - RI were 9 ( ICQ [ 6 , 15 ] ) , 8 . 5 ( ICQ [ 1 , 37 . 5 ] ) , and 10 . 5 ( ICQ [ 0 , 27 ] ) , respectively . The median score for the social withdrawal scale was 3 . 37 ( ICQ [ 2 . 75 , 3 . 5 ] ) . Risk Factors of Mental Health Outcomes Among all COVID - 19 symptoms , only vomiting was associated with anxiety ( r = 0 . 416 , p = 0 . 016 ) , depression ( r = 0 . 406 , p = 0 . 011 ) and PTSD ( r = 0 . 454 , p = 0 . 004 ) . All other correlation coeﬃcients between COVID - 19 symptoms and psychiatric symptoms were not signiﬁcant . Peer rejection was marginally associated with depression ( r = 0 . 264 , p = 0 . 109 ) , anxiety ( r = 0 . 274 , p = 0 . 096 ) , and PTSD ( r = 0 . 264 , p = 0 . 110 ) , while social withdrawal was associated with depression ( r = 0 . 285 , p = 0 . 083 ) , anxiety ( r = 0 . 314 , p = 0 . 055 ) , and PTSD ( r = 0 . 313 , p = 0 . 056 ) . Notably , poor mental health status prior to COVID - 19 infection was associated with an increase in mental health problems following infection ( anxiety , r = − 0 . 266 , p = 0 . 106 ; depression , r = − 0 . 298 , p = 0 . 069 ; PTSD , r = − 0 . 350 , p = 0 . 031 ; see Table 2 ) . Peer rejection was associated with anxiety ( r = 0 . 274 , p = 0 . 096 ) , depression ( r = 0 . 264 , p = 0 . 109 ) , and the PTSD score ( r = 0 . 264 , p = 0 . 110 ) . Parental infection was positively associated with parental ignorance ( r = 0 . 287 , p = Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 3 June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 628707 Liu et al .

We conducted logistic regression with depression , anxiety , and PTSD as dependent variables . Peer rejection was marginally associated with PTSD ( OR , 29 . 29 , 95 % CI , [ 0 . 94 , 908 . 67 ] ) , while social withdrawal was associated with anxiety ( OR , 4 . 61 , 95 % CI , [ 0 . 95 , 22 . 44 ] ) . DISCUSSION The results of this study suggest that a signiﬁcant proportion of pediatric patients suﬀer from mental disorders following COVID - 19 recovery . Although the study cohort’s rate of depression was not higher than that of normal primary students in Wuhan ( 15 . 8 vs . 22 . 6 % ) , their anxiety rate was nearly double that of normal students ( 31 . 6 vs . 18 . 9 % ) ( Xie et al . , 2020 ) . Overall , these rates are higher than the rates of psychiatric symptom observed in the adult patient population ( 31 . 6 vs . 10 . 4 % for anxiety , and 18 . 4 vs . 12 . 4 % for PTSD ) ( Liu et al . , 2020 ) . Because children with COVID - 19 face risks of long - lasting physical symptoms and discrimination ( more risks ) , their high anxiety level may keep for a longer time than normal children . Although most children experience milder physical symptoms of COVID - 19 than adults , pediatric patients may face more psychological threats following hospital discharge . Physical symptoms of COVID - 19 may not be the main threats for children . Most of the pediatric patients in our sample reported at least one physical symptom of COVID - 19— with diarrhea , sore throat , cough , and headache being the most reported symptoms . However , only vomiting was associated with mental health outcomes ( anxiety , depression , and PTSD ) . Peer rejection was the main risk factor for mental health outcomes of COVID - 19 infected children . Socially withdrawn children are expected to experience a series of negative developmental outcomes , including emotional problems ( e . g . , anxiety and depression ) and social adjustment diﬃculties ( Liu et al . , 2015 ) . Notably , family cluster infection was prevalent in COVID - 19 patients . On the one hand , parental infection leads to stigma and peer rejection ; on the other hand , parental ignorance and maternal warmth loss may leave children without protection . Out data suggested that a signiﬁcant proportion of infected children may withdraw from their peers socially . Limitations Limitations of this study include the cross - sectional survey design and a small sample size , which limits the overall power of statistical analyses . Meta - analyses of individual pediatric data should be conducted in the future to enhance the power . We also recommend future studies to collect longitudinal and developmental data for recovering children of COVID - 19 because the eﬀects may last for years for children after the pandemic ( Wade et al . , 2020 ) . Secondly , only one - third of recovered and discharged COVID - 19 patients from the Wuhan Children’s Hospital agreed to participate into the study— resulting in a possible self - selection bias . Finally , all respondents were Chinese children , which may limit the generalizability of the ﬁndings . CONCLUSIONS Pediatric patients are psychologically more vulnerable than adults . Compared with adults , children face more threats ( duration of quarantine and lack of necessary supplies , lack of information ) during the pandemic ( Loades et al . , 2020 ) . Parental infection can have a profound impact on parent - child and peer relationships , and it was found that strong , Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 4 June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 628707 Liu et al . COVID - 19 Children’s Mental Health high - quality relationships between youths and their parents and peers were important resilience factors in protecting the mental health of recovered pediatric COVID - 19 patients . Hence , parents and caregivers are encouraged to cultivate supportive environments for their children , where they are well - connected to their peers and family members . By doing so , parents provide their children with key resilience factors , which helps reduce psychiatric vulnerability and ameliorates multiple risk factors for developing psychiatric conditions .
