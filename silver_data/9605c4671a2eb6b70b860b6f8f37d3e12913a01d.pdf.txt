Advancements in artificial intelligence have opened up new opportunities in people’s creative activities where individual users ideate with diverse forms of AI . For instance , AI agents and intel - ligent tools have been designed as ideation partners that provide inspiration , suggest ideation methods , or generate alternative ideas . However , what AI can bring to collaborative ideation among a group of users has not been fully understood . Compared to ideating with individuals , ideating with multiple users would require under - standing users’ social interaction , transforming individual efforts into a group effort , and—in the end—making users satisfied that they collaborated with other group members . This workshop aims to bring together a community of researchers and practitioners to explore the integration of AI in human - human collaborative ideation . The exploration will center around identifying the po - tential roles of AI as well as the process and form of collaborative ideation , considering what users want to do with AI or humans .

Research has shown that the quality of ideas often increases when people collaborate with each other [ 19 , 21 ] . This is due to the fact that group members can express diverse viewpoints that individuals may not consider other - wise and collaborate on ideation efforts by building on each other’s contributions [ 1 , 2 , 10 ] . This human - human collaborative ideation can be observed in diverse contexts such as when individuals with shared interests seek better ideas or when groups with conflicting needs seek to formulate satisfying solutions for everyone . Extensive research has been performed to understand and support collabo - rative ideation . For instance , various ideation techniques such as brainstorming and ideation cards are practiced in the design field of design , and guidelines have been proposed that any group of users can follow [ 3 , 7 , 16 , 17 ] . Interactive technologies that enable a digi - tal form of ideation have been shown to be useful for idea exchange or consensus - building within the HCI community [ 5 , 12 , 23 ] . This form of ideating ‘through’ machines is now evolving to the next phase where humans ideate ‘with’ artificial intelligence systems . In recent years , research in human - AI collaborative ideation has actively investigated multiple potential forms of AI as an ideation partner ( Figure 1 ) . For instance , intelligent design tools have been developed to proactively suggest inspirational materials or alterna - tive designs related to users’ own ideas and have been shown to broaden users’ perspectives during idea generation [ 6 , 9 ] . Similarly , conversational agents such as chatbots have been developed to ask critical questions to users and help them articulate their own ideas [ 4 , 22 ] . This shows that AI - embedded systems or AI agents can improve users’ ideation processes and outcomes that satisfy individual users . Compared to individual ideation , however , collaborative ideation involves group members’ social interaction , such as building con - sensus or empathizing with other group members’ viewpoints . How AI systems can bring to collaborative ideation among a group of users has not been fully explored yet . A few studies have looked into the potential of AI as a facilitator of humans’ collaborative ideation , encouraging group members to build on each other’s contributions [ 11 , 20 ] , moderating equal turn - taking [ 15 ] , summa - rizing their key ideas [ 8 ] , or guiding consensus - building [ 18 ] . While CHI EA ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Figure 1 : Examples of human - AI collaborative ideation systems . An intelligent design tool helping users design a mood board ( left ) [ 9 ] and a chatbot assisting consensus - building ( right ) [ 18 ] . studies often show AI’s capabilities to contribute to ideation , open questions remain how intelligent systems can support collaborative ideation among people , e . g . : What would users want from AI systems and what would users want from humans despite AI’s capability in doing the same ? Thisworkshopaimstoexplorethefutureofcollaborativeideation between humans and intelligent systems with researchers and prac - titioners from diverse disciplines . This workshop will encourage participants from art , design , social science , computer science , and HCI to integrate AI in a variety of collaborative ideation processes . Going beyond identifying the potential roles of AI , participants will explore roles that AI or humans could or should play and construct collaborative ideation scenarios that provide concrete directions for future research . 2 WORKSHOP GOALS This workshop provides a forum for HCI researchers from diverse backgrounds to discuss the future of human - human collaborative ideation supported using AI systems ( Figure 2 ) . We aim to exchange the understanding and expectation of human actors and AI in multi - ple processes of collaborative ideation ( e . g . , inquiry , idea generation , and consensus - building ) and the forms of collaboration ( e . g . , multi - ple users with multiple AI , ( a ) synchronous , and ( non ) collocated ) . We expect to address conflicting viewpoints on the subjects , un - cover the potential and shortcomings of AI , and establish a common ground that sets the direction of integrating AI into humans’ col - laborative ideation . Accordingly , the goals of this workshop are : • Identify human actors’ roles that AI can perform better or worse . • Explorenewroles , processes , orformsofcollaborativeideation that AI could enable . • Examine what humans would prefer to be performed by humans or AI . • Develop potential scenarios of integrating AI in human - human collaborative ideation . • Investigate the implications of AI that can enable such sce - narios . 3 ORGANIZERS The workshop organizers are all active researchers in the area of interactive systems that support users’ creative and collaborative activities .

During the workshop , this website will be used to update the progress and share materials for asynchronous participants . After the workshop , we will use the website as a platform for fostering further discussion about the subject , presenting selected position papers and a brief summary of the workshop . 4 . 2 Recruitment We aim to recruit researchers and practitioners from diverse fields such as art , design , social science , computer science , and HCI . The participants will be valued for their unique knowledge and view - points that can bring into the discussion : Experts in ( collaborative ) ideation with less understanding of AI or vice versa will be all wel - comed . We will recruit participants via diverse channels such as social media ( e . g . , Twitter and Facebook ) as well as mailing lists of HCI , Computational Design , and Design research communities . We aim for 18 - 24 participants . The participants will be asked to submit 2 to 4 pages of a position paper . We will select participants by the relevance and quality of their position paper and by considering the diversity of participants . 4 . 3 Mode of Workshop We intend to conduct our workshop in - person only . Based on partic - ipants’ position papers and backgrounds , we will predefine groups of 4 - 5 participants that can include multiple viewpoints in each group . To be prepared for participants who may fail to join the workshop in person on the day , we will hold a synchronous online meeting ( e . g . , Zoom ) . Such participants will be able to listen to dis - cussions from other attendees and join one of the participant groups to participate in workshop activities . We will post the progress and materials on our website for them to download . 4 . 4 Required facilities and specifications The workshop will require a VGA projector for the organizers’ and participants’ presentations . Tables and chairs will be needed for 4 - 5 participants to perform workshop activities as a group as well as note - taking materials such as pens , notes , and papers . 5 WORKSHOP STRUCTURE We aim to bring together mixed viewpoints of researchers and practitioners from diverse fields . We intend to uncover conflicting understandings and expectations of human actors , AI , and social interaction in human - human collaborative ideation . This will help to establish a concrete common ground for fruitful discussion dur - ing the workshop . As a result of this workshop , a set of roles to be performed by humans or AI ; the process and form of collaborative ideation enabled by AI ; and representative scenarios that might provide clear directions for future research ideas in the field of HCI will be identified . With consent , we will record the entire workshop sessions and document the artifacts of workshop activities . Morning session : Co - design the roles of AI in human - human collaborative ideation 9 : 00 - 9 : 10 Introduction and scene setting from the organizers . 9 : 10 - 9 : 30 Icebreaker activity : Each participant will spend a couple of minutes writing down their expectations on what AI agents can bring to collaborative ideation between humans on a note card . Then , they will be asked to exchange their cards while introducing themselves to the other attendees . 9 : 30 - 10 : 20 Lightning talk : Participants will present their submitted position papers in front of the other attendees in the form of a lighting talk ( 3 - min talk with 2 - min Q & A ) . 10 : 20 - 10 : 30 Break 10 : 30 - 12 : 00 Co - design session : Participants will co - design the roles of AI from multiple viewpoints , identified from their position papers . They will be guided to perform an ideation method called Dialogue - Lab [ 13 ] . This method is developed by one of the co - authors ( Andrés Lucero ) , which designates multiple areas ( stations ) in a room for CHI EA ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Figure 3 : Ideation techniques in this workshop . Examples of Dialogue - Lab activities ( left ) [ 13 ] and video prototyping ( right ) [ 14 ] from the authors’ research . unique topics ( Figure 3 left ) . Pairs of participants will cycle around the stations for a discussion , focusing on one topic at a time . 12 : 00 - 13 : 30 Lunch Afternoon session : Co - design the process and form of human - human collaborative ideation 13 : 30 - 15 : 30 Co - design session : Based on the designed roles of AI , participants will co - deign the scenario of integrating AI in human - human collaborative ideation . For diversity , each group of partic - ipants will be assigned different roles of AI . They will be asked to perform role - playing techniques to sketch detailed interactions between AI and humans . 15 : 30 - 15 : 40 Break 15 : 40 - 16 : 30 Video prototyping : Participants will be asked to create a video prototype of their scenarios [ 14 ] ( Figure 3 right ) , where one of the group members acts as AI . 16 : 30 - 17 : 30 Presentation of results : Each group of participants will present their scenarios to the group ( 10 - min presentation with 5 - min Q & A ) . 17 : 30 - 18 : 00 Closing discussion : As a closing remark , organizers will lead the last discussion with all participants to share their thoughts on the impact of AI agents in human - human collabora - tive ideation , potential barriers to investigating the subjects , and potential formats of publishing the workshop result . 6 POST - WORKSHOP PLANS The output from the workshop will be summarised and published on our workshop website . This will describe the roles of AI in human - human collaborative ideation . The scenario and video pro - totype will be added to visualize the potential process and form of collaboration related to the potential benefits and shortcomings of AI . To expose our insights to a wider audience , we will post them on active social platforms for design and AI communities . We expect the result of the workshop can make a special issue in both design and HCI journals ( e . g . ToCHI ) , considering the combined perspec - tives from humans’ interpersonal interaction and interaction with AI . This will nurture further research in the community and po - tential collaboration among attendees . We will discuss this at the end of the workshop with our participants . We will also welcome additional researchers who would be inspired by our workshop output . 7 CALL FOR PARTICIPATION People can generate better ideas when they collaborate with one another . AI has been studied to support individual users’ ideation process . In contrast , what AI would bring to collaborative ideation amongagroupofusersisunknown . Comparedtoindividualideation , collaborative ideation requires transforming individuals’ ideation effort to group effort considering complex social interaction among them . Despite AI’s capability in simulating interpersonal interaction between humans , what humans want AI to do and what humans want other humans to do is an open - ended question . Accordingly , new roles , processes , and forms of human - human collaborative ideation could emerge supported by AI . This CHI 2023 workshop welcomes researchers and practitioners from diverse fields such as art , design , social science , computer science , and HCI to discuss the integration of AI agents into human - human collaborative ideation . The workshop will focus on : • Identify human actors’ roles that AI can perform better or worse . • Explorenewroles , processes , orformsofcollaborativeideation that AI could enable . • Examine what humans would prefer to be performed by humans or AI . • Develop potential scenarios of integrating AI in human - human collaborative ideation . • Investigate the implications of AI that can enable such sce - narios . Participants should submit a 2 - to 4 - page position paper ( includ - ing references ) in the CHI Extended Abstracts Format . The proposal should be emailed to joongi . shin @ aalto . fi . The position papers need to describe participants’ interests and / or previous work related to Integrating AI in Human - Human Collaborative Ideation CHI EA ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany the workshop topic . We will select papers based on their relevance , quality , and diversity . We will limit the size of the workshop to 24 people . At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop and all participants must register for both the workshop and for at least one day of the conference . Please contact joongi . shin @ aalto . fi for any questions .
