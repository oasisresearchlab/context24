CCL19 / CCL21 - triggered signal transduction and migration of dendritic cells requires prostaglandin E2 Elke Scandella , Ying Men , Daniel F . Legler , Silke Gillessen , Ladislav Prikler , Burkhard Ludewig , and Marcus Groettrup The control of dendritic cell ( DC ) migra - tion is pivotal for the initiation of cellular immune responses . When activated with inﬂammatory stimuli , the chemokine re - ceptor CCR7 is up - regulated on DCs . Acti - vated DCs home to lymphoid organs , where the CCR7 ligands CCL19 and CCL21 are expressed . We previously found that human monocyte - derived DCs ( MoDCs ) exclusively migrated to CCL19 and CCL21 when matured in the presence of prostaglandin ( PG ) E2 . Because PGE2 did not alter CCR7 cell surface expres - sion , we examined whether PGE2 may exert its effect by coupling CCR7 to sig - nal transduction modules . Indeed , stimu - lation with CCR7 ligands led to enhanced phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase – mediated phosphorylation of protein kinase B when MoDCs were matured in the presence of PGE2 . Moreover , CCL19 / CCL21 - induced intracellular calcium mobilization in MoDCs occurred only when PGE2 was present during maturation . MoDC migra - tion to CCL19 and CCL21 was dependent on phospholipase C and intracellular cal - cium ﬂux but not on phosphatidylinosi - tol - 3 kinase . Hence , our data provide in - sight into CCL19 / CCL21 - triggered signal transduction pathways and identify a novel function for PGE2 in controlling the migration of mature MoDCs by facilitating CCR7 signal transduction . ( Blood . 2004 ; 103 : 1595 - 1601 ) Introduction Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are professional antigen - presenting cells capable of antigen transport and presentation in secondary lym - phoid organs , which is crucial for the initiation and maintenance of T - cell – mediated immune responses . 1 They reside in the periphery in an immature state , taking up pathogens through pinocytosis or receptor - mediated endocytosis , leading to the induction of DC maturation . Mature DCs undergo phenotypical and functional changes , including up - regulation of the chemokine receptor CCR7 . 2 The expression of CCR7 on mature DCs and on naive and central memory T cells is essential for their coordinated migration to the T - cell area of draining lymph nodes because this migration is guided by CCL19 ( EBI1 - ligand chemokine [ ELC ] , macrophage inﬂammatory protein [ MIP ] - 3 (cid:2) ) , and CCL21 ( secondary lymphoid - tissue chemokine [ SLC ] , 6 - Ckine ) , the 2 ligands for CCR7 . Both chemokines are expressed by stromal cells in the T - cell area of secondary lymphoid organs . The essential role of CCR7 and its ligands for the migration of mature DCs to lymph nodes was demonstrated in CCR7 - deﬁcient mice 3 and plt / plt mice , which lack the ligands for CCR7 . 4 Chemokine receptors are transmembrane receptors of the class A rhodopsin - like family , which span the membrane 7 - fold and transduce their signals through G proteins , mainly of the G (cid:3) i subclass . 5 Receptor stimulation leads to the inhibition of adenyl cyclases through G (cid:3) i - and G (cid:2)(cid:4) - mediated activation of phospho - lipase C ( PLC ) , followed by diacylglycerol ( DAG ) – mediated activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) and the release of calcium from intracellular stores . 6 Furthermore , G (cid:2)(cid:4) subunits that are released from G (cid:3) i proteins transiently activate phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinases ( PI3Ks ) , leading to the activation of protein kinase B ( PKB , Akt ) and extracellular signal - regulated kinase - 2 ( Erk - 2 ) . 7 However , most data on the signal transduction of chemokine receptors have been obtained with CXCR1 , CCR2 , CCR5 , and CXCR4 , but little information is available about CCR7 signal transduction . Recently , Rho - associated kinases have been shown to be required for the CCR7 - mediated polarization and chemotaxis of T lymphocytes . 8 Another study suggests that CCR7 signaling involves the activation of a Janus kinase ( JAK ) . 9 It is still a matter of debate , however , whether the JAK / signal transducer and activa - tor of transcription ( JAK / STAT ) pathway , which requires chemo - kine receptor dimerization , contributes to chemokine - mediated signal transduction . 10 In addition , most studies have been per - formed with neutrophils , peritoneal macrophages , and T cells but not with DCs . Recently , we and others observed that the maturation - induced up - regulation of CCR7 expression on human monocyte - derived DCs ( MoDCs ) was insufﬁcient to allow MoDC migration to CCL19 and CCL21 . 11 , 12 Human MoDCs matured either with soluble CD40L ( sCD40L ) or with polyI : C markedly enhanced surface expression of CCR7 but were not at all or were only poorly responsive to CCL19 and CCL21 . Interestingly , MoDC migration to CCL19 and CCL21 was readily observed on maturation in the presence of the proinﬂammatory mediator prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , though PGE2 did not change the expression level of CCR7 on mature MoDCs , providing evidence for an alternative effect of 1595 Konstanzer Online - Publikations - System ( KOPS ) URL : http : / / nbn - resolving . de / urn : nbn : de : bsz : 352 - 166780 Erschienen in : Blood ; 103 ( 2004 ) , 5 . - S . 1595 - 1601 https : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1182 / blood - 2003 - 05 - 1643 PGE2 . The importance of PGE2 for DC migration in vivo has recently been shown in Ptger4 (cid:5) / (cid:5) mice lacking the PGE2 receptor EP4 . These mice display impaired migration of Langerhans cells and reduced skin immune responses . 13 However , other DC types , such as CD1b / c (cid:6) peripheral blood DCs , do not require an additional PGE2 stimulus for effective CCR7 - mediated migration . 12 In this study we investigated the hypothesis that PGE2 may facilitate CCL19 / CCL21 - directed migration by coupling the cog - nate chemokine receptor CCR7 to its signal transduction modules . Indeed , we found that PGE2 was required during sCD40L - stimulated maturation of MoDCs to activate PKB and to mobilize intracellular free calcium as downstream signaling events of CCR7 . Moreover , we demonstrate that PLC - mediated cytoplasmic Ca 2 (cid:6) mobilization was a prerequisite for the chemotaxis of MoDCs to CCL19 and CCL21 . Our results , hence , provide evidence that PGE2 is required to facilitate the CCR7 - mediated signal transduc - tion and migration of MoDCs .

Generation of human MoDCs MoDCs were generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) , as described previously . 11 Brieﬂy , PBMCs were separated by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll - Paque ( Pharmacia , Uppsala , Sweden ) , resuspended at 4 (cid:8) 10 6 cells / mL in AIM V medium , and allowed to adhere to plastic for 1 hour at 37 C . Nonadherent cells were removed , and remaining cells were cultured in AIM V medium supplemented with GM - CSF ( 50 ng / mL ) and IL - 4 ( 1000 U / mL ) . MoDCs derived from the adherence step were only used when the content of remaining B and T cells was below 2 % . Alternatively , monocytes were puriﬁed from PBMCs by positive selection using anti - CD14 – conjugated magnetic microbeads ( Mil - tenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) and were cultivated at 1 (cid:8) 10 6 cells / mL . On day 6 , nonadherent and loosely adherent cells were harvested and recultured ( 5 (cid:8) 10 5 cells / mL ) for an additional 48 hours in cytokine - containing medium in the absence or presence of 1 (cid:9) g / mL sCD40L to induce maturation . Where indicated , PGE2 ( 1 (cid:9) g / mL ) or H - 89 was added during stimulation . Cell stimulation and Western blot analysis MoDCs were washed twice with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and resuspended in AIM V medium without additives ( 2 (cid:8) 10 7 cells / mL ) . Aliquots of 2 (cid:8) 10 6 cells were incubated for 10 minutes at 37 C and were stimulated with CCL19 or CCL21 ( 250 ng / mL ) for different periods of time . Incubations were terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid ( TCA ) to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 % . Protein pellets were washed twice with ice - cold acetone and dissolved by boiling in 1 (cid:8) Laemmli sodium dodecyl sulphate ( SDS ) loading buffer containing 5 % 2 - mercaptoethanol . Proteins were separated on 10 % SDS – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes . The membranes were blocked with 5 % low - fat dry milk in 1 (cid:8) TBS - buffer and were incubated with the respective antibodies overnight on a rocking plate at 4 C . After washing , HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies were bound and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence ( Pierce , Socochim , Lau - sanne , Switzerland ) . Thereafter , membranes were stripped with 0 . 2 M NaOH for 5 minutes and then washed and reprobed with control antibodies . Chemotaxis assay Chemotaxis of MoDCs was measured by migration through a polycarbon - ate ﬁlter of 5 (cid:9) m pore size in 24 - well transwell chambers ( Corning Costar , Cambridge , MA ) . AIM V ( 600 (cid:9) L ) containing indicated doses of CCL19 , CCL21 , CXCL - 12 , or medium alone as a control for spontaneous migration was added to the lower chamber ; 1 (cid:8) 10 5 DCs ( 100 (cid:9) L ) were added to the upper chamber and were incubated for 3 hours at 37 C . A500 - (cid:9) Laliquot of the cells that migrated to the bottom chamber was counted by ﬂow cytometry in a FACScan acquiring events for a ﬁxed time period of 60 seconds using CellQuest software ( Becton Dickinson , Basel , Switzerland ) . Each experiment was performed in duplicate . The mean number of spontaneously migrated cells was subtracted from the total number of migrated cells . Values are given as percentage of migrated cells (cid:10) SEM . Where indicated , cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C with various drugs and were washed twice before the migration assay . Intracellular free Ca 2 (cid:2) mobilization MoDCs ( 1 (cid:8) 10 6 / mL ) were loaded with 4 (cid:9) M ﬂuo - 3 - actetomethylester ( ﬂuo - 3 - AM ) in the presence of 1 (cid:9) M pluronic F - 127 ( Molecular Probes , Leiden , The Netherlands ) in loading - buffer ( 145 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM glucose , 1 mM CaCl 2 , and 10 mM HEPES ( N - 2 - hydroxyethylpiperazine - N (cid:7) - 2 - ethanesulfonic acid ; pH 7 . 5 ) for 30 minutes at room temperature . Where indicated , BAPTA - AM was loaded simultaneously into MoDCs . Subsequently , cells were washed twice with loading buffer or Ca 2 (cid:6) - free loading buffer containing 2 mM EGTA ( ethylene glycol - bis ( 2 - aminoethylether ) - N , N , N (cid:7) , N (cid:7) - tetraacetic acid ) and were stored on ice . For aquisition , cells were incubated for 10 minutes at 37 C before stimulation with CCL19 , CCL21 ( 250 ng / mL ) , or ionomycin ( 1 (cid:9) g / mL ) , and ﬂuorescence was recorded over time by ﬂow cytometry . Results MoDC migration to CCL19 and CCL21 requires activation of protein kinase A and Rho - associated kinases Previously , we and others demonstrated that human MoDCs required PGE2 during maturation to migrate to CCL19 and CCL21 effectively . 11 , 12 Earlier studies showing PGE2 - induced migration of MoDCs were performed in the presence of high PGE2 concentra - tions ( in the micromolar range ) , at concentrations far above the physiologic levels found in extracellular ﬂuids at least under noninﬂammatory conditions . 14 For a better understanding of the effect of PGE2 to enhance MoDC migration , we ﬁrst performed transwell chemotaxis assays with MoDCs matured with sCD40L and graded concentrations of PGE2 . Maturation with CD40L resulted in mature MoDCs with homogeneous surface expression of CCR7 irrespective of the addition of PGE2 ( Figure 1A ) . 11 However , CCL19 - and CCL21 - induced migration of sCD40L - matured MoDCs required PGE2 and were dose dependent and 1596 already signiﬁcant at a PGE2 concentration of 15 ng / mL ( Figure 1A ) . These PGE2 concentrations were expected to occur at sites of inﬂammation but not in healthy tissues . Furthermore , PGE2 was needed throughout the MoDC maturation process because 1 - hour preincubation of mature MoDCs with PGE2 was insufﬁcient to induce MoDC migration in response to CCL19 and CCL21 ( data not shown ) . PGE2 signaling occurs through the prostaglandin receptors EP2 and EP4 , which are expressed on MoDCs and which lead to increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) levels and to the activation of cAMP - dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) in the cytosol . 11 Therefore , we investigated whether MoDC migration in the presence of PGE2 is dependent on the activation of PKA . To this end , MoDCs were stimulated with sCD40L and PGE2 in the presence of the PKA - speciﬁc inhibitor H - 89 . Treating MoDCs with H - 89 at a concentration of 10 (cid:9) M had no effect on MoDC maturation , CCR7 expression , or viability ( Figure 1B and data not shown ) . However , adding H - 89 for the entire period of maturation reduced the migration of MoDCs in response to CCL19 and CCL21 by approximately 50 % ( Figure 1C ) . In contrast , blocking activation of PKA during the migration assay had no signiﬁcant effect on MoDC migration , indicating that the PGE2 - induced activation of PKA during MoDC maturation may provide a signal that allows them to migrate . Recently , the Rho family of GTPases was shown to be involved in CCR7 - mediated migration of T lymphocytes . 8 To test the involvement of Rho kinase , mature MoDCs were pretreated with graded doses of Y - 27632 , a speciﬁc inhibitor of Rho - associated kinases . Blocking Rho - associated kinases resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of CCL21 - mediated migration of MoDCs ( Figure 1D ) , conﬁrming the ﬁndings observed in T lymphocytes . PGE2 does not affect chemokine - mediated Erk - 1 / 2 activation Because PGE2 did not alter the cell surface expression of CCR7 on sCD40L - matured MoDCs , we investigated whether PGE2 might facilitate migration by coupling CCR7 to its signal transduction pathway . Signal transduction of CCR7 in DCs has not been addressed so far . An earlier study on T cells , however , demon - strated that CCL19 stimulation resulted in the activation of the MAP - kinase cascade , leading to a transient activation of Erk - 2 by phosphorylation at threonine and tyrosine residues . 7 We matured MoDCs with sCD40L in the presence or absence of PGE2 , stimulated them with CCL19 for different time periods , and investigated Erk activation using Western blotting . Using an antibody detecting Erk - 1 and Erk - 2 exclusively when phosphory - lated at Thr202 and Tyr204 , we found rapid and transient Erk - 1 / 2 activation after 2 to 7 minutes of CCL19 stimulation ( Figure 2A ) . However , there was no signiﬁcant difference in Erk - 1 / 2 activation or duration between MoDCs matured with sCD40L in the presence or absence of PGE2 . PGE2 enhances CCL19 - mediated PKB activation A second major pathway triggered by chemokines is the stimula - tion of phosphatidyl - inositol 3 - kinase ( PI3 - kinase ) leading to the formation of phosphatidyl - 3 , 4 , 5 , - trisphosphate ( PIP3 ) and the activation of PKB . 7 Hence , we investigated the activation of PKB in MoDCs on CCR7 triggering . CCL19 induced rapid and transient phosphorylation of PKB in MoDCs , as demonstrated by Western blotting using phospho Ser473 - speciﬁc PKB antibodies ( Figure 2B ) . Interestingly , PKB activation was stronger and more pro - longed in MoDCs matured in the presence of PGE2 than in MoDCs matured with sCD40L alone . PKB phosphorylation peaked after 2 minutes of CCL19 triggering and remained detectable after 15 Figure1 . PGE2 - inducedMoDCmigrationtoCCL19andCCL21isPKAandRhokinasedependent .

Subsequently , MoDCs were tested for CCL19 - and CCL21 - triggered migration in transwell assays ( left axis ) and were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry for the expression of CCR7 ( right axis ) . ( B ) MoDCs were matured with sCD40L and PGE2 in the presence or absence of the PKA inhibitor H - 89 for 48 hours .

CCL21 - mediated activation of Erk - 1 / 2 and PKB in MoDCs . MoDCs were matured in he presence or absence of PGE2 and subse - quently were stimulated with CCL21 ( 250 ng / mL ) for the indicated time periods . Whole - cell lysates were separated on SDS - PAGE and trans - ferred to nitrocellulose membranes . ( A ) Membranes were stained with an antibody against phosphorylated ( Thr202 / Tyr204 ) Erk - 1 / 2 ( p - Erk ) or total Erk - 1 / 2 ( t - Erk ) . ( B ) Membranes were probed with an antibody against phosphorylated ( S473 ) PKB ( p - PKB ) or total PKB ( t - PKB ) . Results from 1 of 4 independent representative experiments are shown . 1597 minutes in MoDCs matured in the presence of PGE2 . In contrast , MoDC maturation without PGE2 allowed only weak phosphoryla - tion of PKB after 2 minutes , which disappeared after 5 minutes of chemokine stimulation ( Figure 2B ) . In some experiments , the activation of PKB in MoDCs matured in the absence of PGE2 was even below the detection limit ( data not shown ) . Migration of MoDCs to CCL19 and CCL21 is not dependent on PKB activation We next analyzed whether inefﬁcient chemokine - mediated activa - tion of PKB in MoDCs matured in the absence of PGE2 was responsible for their reduced migration . Hence , MoDCs matured in the presence of PGE2 were incubated for 10 minutes with the speciﬁc PI3 - kinase inhibitor wortmannin or Ly - 249002 , each of which blocks the downstream activation of PKB . Unexpectedly , neither wortmannin nor Ly - 249002 had an effect on MoDC migration to CCL19 and CCL21 ( Figure 3A - B ) . To rule out the ineffective inhibition of PKB phosphorylation by wortmannin , MoDC lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis . Preincubat - ing MoDCs with 100 nM wortmannin prevented Ser473 phosphor - ylation of PKB almost completely , but Erk - 1 / 2 activation was not affected by this treatment ( Figure 3C ) , indicating that wortmannin inhibition was effective . PGE2 is required for CCL19 / CCL21 - mediated Ca 2 (cid:2) mobilization Another consequence of chemokine receptor stimulation is the activation of G - protein – sensitive PLC isoforms , resulting in the generation of DAG and inositol 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate , which leads to the release of Ca 2 (cid:6) from intracellular stores . Hence , we analyzed CCL19 / CCL21 - induced Ca 2 (cid:6) mobilization in MoDCs matured in the presence or absence of PGE2 by ﬂow cytometry . Triggering MoDCs with CCL19 or CCL21 resulted in a rapid rise in intracellular free Ca 2 (cid:6) concentrations only on maturation in the presence ( Figure 4C - D ) , but not in the absence , of PGE2 ( Figure 4A - B ) . Ca 2 (cid:6) mobilization was substantially reduced when PGE2 - treated MoDCs were preincubated with the speciﬁc PLC inhibitor U73122 ( Figure 5C ) . In contrast , increases in cytosolic free Ca 2 (cid:6) concentrations were less affected by the chelation of extracellular Ca 2 (cid:6) concentrations by 2 mM EGTA ( Figure 5B ) . The combination of both—the inhibition of PLC with U73122 and the presence of 2 mM EGTA—abrogated the Ca 2 (cid:6) signal completely ( Figure 5D ) , indicating that intracellular and extracellular calcium stores contrib - uted to the cytoplasmic calcium ﬂux . MoDC migration in response to CCL21 was not reduced in the presence of 2 mM EGTA in the assay buffer ( Figure 6A ) , which suggests that calcium mobilization from intracellular stores sufﬁces to maintain the migratory capacity . PLC activation is required for MoDC migration to CCL19 , CCL21 , and CXCL - 12 To assess whether the activation of PLC is required for migration , MoDCs were incubated with increasing amounts of the PLC inhibitor U73122 . As depicted in Figure 6B , MoDC migration in response to CCL19 and CCL21 was completely blocked after treatment with 200 nM U73122 . Half - maximal inhibition was observed at 50 nM U73122 . Ca 2 (cid:6) activates , in conjunction with DAG , various isoforms of PKC . Additionally , PKC can be activated through signal transduc - tion events initiated by the stimulation of the PI3 - kinase pathway . The contribution of PKC to MoDC migration was investigated using either the PKC inhibitor staurosporine or the PKC activator Figure 3 . Activation of PKB is not required for the migration of MoDCs in response to CCL19 and CCL21 . MoDCs matured in the presence of PGE2 were incubated for 30 minutes with graded doses of ( A ) wortmannin or ( B ) Ly - 294002 and were tested for migration to CCL21 and CCL19 in a transwell assay .

At least 5 independent experiments with MoDCs from different donors yielded similar results . 1598 PMA . Staurosporine is an unspeciﬁc protein kinase inhibitor that inhibits PKC ( IC 50 , 3 nM ) , PKA ( IC 50 , 7 nM ) , and Ca 2 (cid:6) / calmodulin - dependent ( CaM ) kinase 2 ( IC 50 , 20 nM ) . 15 , 16 Pretreatment of MoDCs matured in the presence of PGE2 with staurosporine at effective concentrations to block PKC ( 4 nM ) did not affect MoDC migration to CCL19 and CCL21 . However , staurosporine signiﬁ - cantly reduced the migration of MoDCs in response to CCL19 and CCL21 at concentrations that interfered with the activation of other protein kinases such as CaM kinases ( Figure 6D ) . Interestingly , the migration of MoDCs to CCL19 and CCL21 was abrogated after pretreatment with graded concentrations of PMA , implicating that the heterologous activation of PKC impedes chemokine - induced signaling ( Figure 6C ) . To investigate whether the dependence of MoDC migration on PGE2 was valid for another chemokine receptor of MoDCs , we examined the CXCR4 - directed migration of MoDCs to SDF - 1 / CXCL12 ( Figure 6E ) . Remarkably , the migration of MoDCs to CXCL12 in transwell assays occurred only when MoDCs were matured in the presence of PGE2 , in agreement with a recent report by Luft et al . 12 In addition , migration to CXCL12 was inhibited with the PLC inhibitor U73122 but not with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin . Intracellular Ca 2 (cid:2) ﬂux is required for MoDC migration To test whether Ca 2 (cid:6) mobilization is essential for migration , the cell - permeable Ca 2 (cid:6) chelator BAPTA - AM was used to trap liber - ated Ca 2 (cid:6) in the cytoplasm after chemokine stimulation of PGE2 - treated MoDCs ( Figure 7B ) . Chelation of intracellular free Ca 2 (cid:6) by BAPTA - AM inhibited the migration of MoDCs to CCL19 and CCL21 in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 7A ) , thus indicating that Ca 2 (cid:6) mobilization is required for MoDC migration . Taken together , MoDCs require PGE2 during maturation for CCL19 / CCL21 - induced activation of PKB and Ca 2 (cid:6) mobilization . In contrast to the PI3 - kinase – mediated activation of PKB , activating the PLC pathway leading to the liberation of intracellular free Ca 2 (cid:6) is essential for MoDC migration . Discussion Up - regulation of the chemokine receptor CCR7 on DCs is crucial for their homing to secondary lymphoid organs , where the CCR7 ligands CCL19 and CCL21 are expressed . Two recent studies demonstrated that CCR7 , though present on mature MoDCs , failed under certain conditions to mediate migration to CCL19 and CCL21 , suggesting that CCR7 can exist on the cell surface in an inactive form . 11 , 12 One of the factors required for MoDC migration to lymph node – derived chemokines was identiﬁed as the inﬂamma - tory mediator PGE2 , which transmits its effect through the elevation of intracellular cAMP . As we have demonstrated , the amount of PGE2 and the duration of PGE2 stimulation during maturation seemed to be critical for CCR7 - mediated MoDC migration . PGE2 concentrations at inﬂammatory sites were re - ported to be between 0 . 2 nM and 1 . 69 (cid:9) M . 14 , 17 , 18 Here , we demonstrate that at a physiologic concentration of PGE2 , MoDCs are capable of migrating in response to CCL19 and CCL21 . It is also likely that at sites of inﬂammation , the DC microenvironment contains high levels of PGE2 because it is surrounded by other immune cells , such as monocytes , that produce large amounts of this mediator once they are stimulated . 19 Figure6 .

Atleast3independentexperimentswithMoDCs from different donors gave similar results . 1599 Increased cytosolic cAMP levels after PGE2 stimulation and subsequent activation of the cAMP - dependent PKA seem to play a key role in activating the migratory capacity of MoDCs . We showed that inhibiting cAMP - dependent PKA dramatically re - duces MoDC chemokine - directed migration . Furthermore , a recent study shows that stimulating MoDCs with adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , which also leads to increased intracellular cAMP levels , enhances the migration of MoDCs to CCR7 ligands . 20 CCL19 / CCL21 - induced migration of MoDCs is pertussis toxin sensitive , indicating that the responding chemokine recep - tor , CCR7 , is coupled to G proteins of the G (cid:3) i type . 11 In this study we show that CCR7 stimulation with CCL19 and CCL21 involves the activation of at least 3 main pathways in PGE2 - treated MoDCs , including PI3 - kinase and PKB phosphorylation , PLC activation and calcium release , and the MAP - kinase pathway . The requirement for PI3 - kinase and PLC activation in chemokine - induced migration is still a matter of debate and seems to vary with the cell type and with the kind of chemokine receptor analyzed . Although the migration of human neutrophils to formyl peptides , complement components such as C5a or C3a , and CXCL8 ( IL - 8 ) was independent of PI3 - kinase activa - tion , studies in mice lacking the PI3 - kinase - (cid:4) isoform showed reduced neutrophil migration to these chemoattractants . 21 - 23 In addition it has been reported that , in contrast to monocytes , the migration of human T lymphocytes to CCL5 was sensitive to the speciﬁc PI3 - kinase inhibitor wortmannin . 24 We show that MoDC chemotaxis to CCL19 and CCL21 is independent of the activation of PI3 - kinase because migration was insensitive to the PI3 - kinase inhibitors wortmannin and Ly294002 . This is in accordance with a recent report that treating freshly isolated mouse lymphocytes with wortmannin or Ly294002 had only minor effects on lymphocyte chemotaxis to CCL21 . 9 The requirement of PLC activation for chemotaxis was mainly reported for murine neutrophils . Neutrophils from PLC - (cid:2) 2 – and PLC - (cid:2) 3 – deﬁcient mice were normal with respect to chemotaxis to formyl peptides or CXCL8 , 21 indicating that the Ca 2 (cid:6) signal is not elementary for chemotaxis in these cells . MoDC migration to CCL19 and CCL21 , in contrast , was strictly dependent on the activation of PLC and the liberation of intracellular free Ca 2 (cid:6) , as shown in our experiments with the PLC - speciﬁc inhibitor U73122 and by chelating intracellular Ca 2 (cid:6) . One possible role of chemokine - induced Ca 2 (cid:6) mobiliza - tion in MoDCs could be the activation of Ca 2 (cid:6) / calmodulin - dependent kinases ( CaMKs ) , as reported for CXCL8 - mediated migration of human neutrophils . 25 Consistent with this notion , treating MoDCs with staurosporine at concentrations that affect CaMK activation signiﬁcantly reduced the migration of MoDCs to CCL19 and CCL21 ( Figure 6D ) . Interestingly , chemokine - induced activation of Erk - 1 / 2 was similar in MoDCs matured in the presence or absence of PGE2 , suggesting that MAP - kinase activation does not mediate CCL19 or CCL21 migration of MoDCs . Indeed , there is not much evidence that Erk activation is required for cell migration , as shown for neutrophils and monocytes . 26 , 27 Although Erk activa - tion relies on G proteins , the chemokine receptor or cell type determines whether Erk - 1 / 2 phosphorylation occurs directly through G - protein – activated ras or an indirect pathway involv - ing the activation of PI3 - kinase and the subsequent stimulation of ras through PKC . The involvement of tyrosine kinase in CCR7 - mediated chemotaxis has been shown by Stein et al 9 for primary lymphocytes using the JAK inhibitor tyrphostin ( AG490 ) . We also observed partial inhibition of MoDC migra - tion to CCL21 using the same concentration ( 100 (cid:9) M ) of AG490 , but the outcome of these experiments was too variable to make a deﬁnitive statement ( data not shown ) . Our results clearly show that PGE2 is essential for CCR7 - mediated Ca 2 (cid:6) mobilization and for the subsequent migration of MoDCs . Thus , we provide evidence that CCR7 can act as a functional decoy receptor on MoDCs in the absence of PGE2 . The expression of chemokine receptors that fail to generate active intracellular signaling after ligand engagement has been reported in several cell types . For instance , inﬂammatory chemokine receptors on monocytes and MoDCs treated with IL - 10 in combination with an inﬂammatory stimulus are not down - regulated , but they fail to respond to their respective ligands . 28 Moreover , germinal center B cells are unable to activate chemotaxis in response to CXCL12 in spite of their surface expression of CXCR4 . 29 Chemokine receptor inactivation can occur through phosphor - ylation of the receptor itself or the downstream effector PLC - (cid:2) . 30 Accordingly , receptor inactivation was mediated by heterologous activation of PKC after ligand binding to other chemoattractant receptors ; hence , this mechanism is referred to as cross - desensitization . The fact that MoDC migration to CCL19 and CCL21 can be inhibited through heterologous activation of PKC by PMA ( Figure 6C ) or ATP 20 suggests that CCR7 may be inactivated by cross - desensitization . Correspond - ingly , CXCR4 inactivation and monocyte migration failure in response to CCL3 ( MIP - 1 (cid:3) ) , CCL5 , formyl peptides , and CCL2 ( monocyte chemoattractant protein [ MCP ] - 1 ) were reported after PMA treatment . 30 However , other mechanisms for chemo - kine receptor inactivation , such as up - regulation of the suppres - sors of cytokine signaling proteins that were shown to bind to CXCR4 and to block JAK / STAT and G (cid:3) i pathways , have been described . 31 In conclusion , we show that MoDCs require environmental instruction by PGE2 to couple CCR7 expression to signal transduction pathways and migration in vitro . Given also that CXCR4 - mediated migration of MoDCs to CXCL - 12 depended on the presence of PGE2 during maturation , this phenomenon of receptor coupling may be valid for other chemokine receptors ( Figure 6E ) . 12 This puts a new focus onto PGE2 and its role in Figure7 .

These ﬁndings could open up therapeutic opportunities for immune diseases and transplantation medicine and for the development of MoDC - based vaccines .
