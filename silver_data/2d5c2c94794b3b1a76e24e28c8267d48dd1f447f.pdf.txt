ASSESSING INDIVIDUAL RISK ATTITUDES USING FIELD DATA FROM LOTTERY GAMES Connel Fullenkamp , Rafael Tenorio , and Robert Battalio * Abstract —We use information from the television game show with the highest guaranteed average payoff in the United States , Hoosier Million - aire , to analyze risktaking in a high - stakes experiment . We characterize gambling decisions under alternative assumptions about contestant behav - ior and preferences , and derive testable restrictions on individual risk attitudes based on this characterization . We then use an extensive sample of gambling decisions to estimate distributions of risk - aversion parameters consistent with the theoretical restrictions and revealed preferences . We ﬁnd that although most contestants display risk - averse preferences , the extent of the risk aversion implied by our estimates varies substantially with the stakes involved in the different decisions . I . Introduction A series of recent studies ( Rabin , 2000a , 2000b ; Rabin and Thaler , 2001 ) have pointed out the inadequacy of expected - utility theory to provide proper characterization of risk aversion when monetary stakes are small . The basic contention of this criticism is that the concavity of the utility function would have to be so pronounced to explain small - stake risk aversion that this same utility function would imply absurd levels of risk aversion for large stakes . Rabin ( 2000b ) concludes that “Expected - utility theory seems to be a useful and adequate model of risk aversion for many purposes , such as understanding large - stakes insur - ance . . . , ” but “is manifestly not close to the right expla - nation of risk attitudes over modest stakes . . . . ” A number of studies have attempted to characterize indi - vidual risk aversion under large stakes using expected - utility theory . Experiments by Binswanger ( 1981 ) and Kachelmeier and Shehata ( 1992 ) face subjects with deci - sions involving small nominal stakes that are large relative to the subjects’ wealth . Their ﬁndings are mixed : whereas Binswanger’s subjects exhibit more risk - averse behavior as stakes are increased , Kachelmeier and Shehata conclude that “the effects of monetary payoffs are real , albeit subtle , and are in need of further study . ” Unfortunately , the inherent limitations of rewards in experimental studies make it dif - ﬁcult to get more robust conclusions about risktaking in large - stakes settings .

THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS 218 The Review of Economics and Statistics , February 2003 , 85 ( 1 ) : 218 – 225 © 2003 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology stakes . Gertner ( 1993 ) uses betting decisions from the bonus round of the television game show Card Sharks , and con - cludes that individuals exhibit a small degree of risk aver - sion . Metrick ( 1995 ) and Hersch and McDougall ( 1997 ) analyze ﬁeld data from wagering decisions on the television game shows Final Jeopardy ! and Illinois Instant Riches , respectively , and ﬁnd that contestants display behavior that is statistically indistinguishable from risk neutrality . In con - trast , Beetsma and Schotman ( 2001 ) conclude that contes - tants in the Dutch television show LINGO exhibit substan - tial risk aversion . In this paper we use information from the television show Hoosier Millionaire to gain additional insight into the be - havior of individuals in high - stakes situations . Although this show has undergone a number of regime changes , the current regime is representative of the typical decision a contestant faces : she may either ( a ) take a sure $ 100 , 000 , or ( b ) play a game in which she gets $ 150 , 000 , $ 200 , 000 , 1 , 000 , 000 , or $ 0 , each with equal probability . If she draws $ 150 , 000 or $ 200 , 000 , she may stop playing and keep the prize , or continue drawing from the remaining alternatives until she either decides to stop , or draws $ 0 or $ 1 , 000 , 000 . Prizes are not cumulative . We believe , for various reasons , that the structure of the decision problems in Hoosier Millionaire provides us with a very appealing natural experiment to study individual decisions under risk . First , unlike previous game studies , the realization of the risky prospect is the outcome of a very simple probability process , where no subjectivity or skills are involved . 1 Second , the stakes are larger than those in previous studies , thus allowing a more proper characteriza - tion of risk aversion using expected - utility theory . Finally , our data comprise a time series of games involving several regime changes , which allows us to study the sensitivity of individual behavior across various gambles . Our approach to analyzing risk aversion differs signiﬁ - cantly from previous game - based studies . Exogenous wa - gers and lack of variation in the gambles prevent us from estimating risk - aversion parameters using regression tech - niques . Instead , we use the sample properties of the deci - sions in the different regimes of Hoosier Millionaire to estimate the parameters of the distribution of risk - aversion coefﬁcients in the contestant population . In addition , unlike previous studies , we explicitly allow for various degrees of contestant rationality in our estimation . Our results show that most individuals behave in a way consistent with risk aversion , and as noted in recent studies , the implied degree of risk aversion varies largely with the stakes of the decision . In fact , our estimates imply substan - tial risk aversion for gambles comparable to those in Hoo - sier Millionaire , while also implying near - risk - neutrality for smaller gambles of similar structure . We also show that the effect of different behavioral traits on decisions and risk aversion is only evident under large stakes . II . A Brief History of Hoosier Millionaire The Hoosier Lottery’s weekly television show , Hoosier Millionaire , ﬁrst aired on October 28 , 1989 . Since its inception , each show has involved six contestants chosen randomly from a pool of entries submitted by people playing a scratch - off ticket game . All contestants participate in the ﬁrst of two phases played on each show . In phase I , all six contestants play a series of purely random draw games . The contestant who amasses the most cash wins and proceeds to phase II ; the remaining ﬁve contestants leave the show . All six contestants keep the cash and prizes accumulated in phase I . Four regimes have governed phase II of Hoosier Million - aire . In regime 1 , the phase I winner has the option of choosing one of four numbers randomly associated with the dollar amounts $ 50 , 000 , $ 100 , 000 , and $ 1 , 000 , 000 , and a consolation prize of $ 25 , 000 . If the contestant draws $ 1 million , she wins that amount , paid out in 10 equal annual payments , and the game is over . If the contestant draws $ 50 , 000 or $ 100 , 000 , she can keep that amount or give it up and make another choice among the remaining alternatives . She continues until she chooses to stop , wins the $ 1 million , or draws the consolation prize . In October of 1990 , the two intermediate amounts offered in the gamble changed from $ 50 , 000 and $ 100 , 000 to $ 100 , 000 and $ 200 , 000 . All other features remained the same . We call this regime 2 . In February of 1992 , more changes were made to phase II . First , the lowest amount attainable in the initial drawing changed from $ 100 , 000 to $ 150 , 000 . Second , the consolation prize went down from $ 25 , 000 to 1 , 000 scratch - off lottery tickets with a purchase price of $ 1 each . Finally , lottery ofﬁcials changed the payment of the $ 1 million prize to twenty annual payments of $ 50 , 000 . We call this regime 3 . Rules currently governing phase II of Hoosier Millionaire were instituted in February of 1994 . According to Pat Traub , the lottery’s acting deputy director , these changes offer “ . . . the highest guaranteed prize of any game show in the nation . . . ” and were made to “ . . . enhance the show’s entertainment value . ” Two revisions were made . First , a contestant is now automatically endowed with a guaranteed $ 100 , 000 prize . She may then decide to keep that amount and walk away from the show , or give it up and choose one of the four numbers just as in regime 3 . The other change involved extending the period of time over which the $ 1 , 000 , 000 prize is paid out from twenty to twenty - ﬁve years . 2 We call this regime 4 . 1 Both Card Sharks and Illinois Instant Riches involve nontrivial prob - ability calculations , and Final Jeopardy and LINGO involve subjective assessments of one’s ( or other players’ ) ability to solve a puzzle or answer a question . 2 This change , not widely publicized by the Lottery Commission , be - came a heated point of contention in the 1994 Indiana state elections . NOTES 219 III . Analytical Issues In analytical terms , the problem a Hoosier Millionaire contestant faces is one of sequential decisions with no recall . This means that the outcome of the ﬁrst decision may give the contestant the option to continue playing , but once a continuation decision is made at any stage , the status quo is no longer available . In a problem like this , the optimal decisions follow from using a dynamic programming ( or backward induction ) technique . This means starting at the ﬁnal decision node , assessing the values of continuing and stopping at that stage , and then factoring in these values when making decisions at the previous stage ( s ) . This pro - cedure is equivalent to ﬁnding the subgame - perfect equilib - rium in a game against nature . In analyzing the optimal strategy for each regime , we consider the following behavioral hypotheses : Full Rationality ( FR ) . A contestant performs backward induction at each decision node , and discounts the $ 1 , 000 , 000 prize according to the annuity system . 3 Bounded Rationality 1 ( BR1 ) . Same as FR , but no dis - counting is applied to the $ 1 , 000 , 000 prize . Bounded Rationality 2 ( BR2 ) . Contestants do not per - form backward induction at every decision node , that is , they do not take into account the value of the option to continue playing the game , and evaluate each lottery as a simple rather than a sequentially compounded lottery . An - nuities are discounted . Bounded Rationality 3 ( BR3 ) . Same as BR2 , but annu - ities are not discounted . Our bounded - rationality scenarios are motivated by bi - ases observed in decision settings comparable to our prob - lem . Empirical and experimental evidence suggests that low or even negative discounting is common in decisions in - volving evaluation of income streams over time ( BR1 , BR3 ) . Loewenstein and Prelec ( 1991 ) , Loewenstein and Thaler ( 1989 ) , and Gigliotti and Sopher ( 1997 ) note that most subjects prefer a more constant and spread - out stream of income over a strictly decreasing pattern of payments . 4 , 5 There is also extensive evidence that individuals fail to perform backward induction in sequential decision envi - ronments ( BR2 , BR3 ) . Carbone and Hey ( 1998 ) report a series of decision - making experiments where individuals do not apply Bellman’s principle of optimality . Similarly , Camerer et al . ( 1993 ) show that subjects do not reason backward in simple alternating - offers bargaining experi - ments . Instead , most subjects base their decision on current - round payoffs . 6 Figures 1 and 2 show the game trees associated with regimes 3 and 4 of Hoosier Millionaire . We subsequently analyze optimal decisions under each of the behavioral hypotheses outlined above . A . Risk Neutrality If decisions depend solely on expected values at each decision node , simple calculations show that : 1 . Boundedly rational contestants who do not discount annuities ( BR1 and BR3 ) always choose the gamble over the sure prospect . Here , the $ 1 , 000 , 000 prize makes the gambles’ expected values very large across the board , even when contestants do not backward - induct . 2 . If contestants discount annuities ( FR and BR2 ) , gambling may become unattractive as discounting increases . Table 1 shows the discount rates that make a contestant indifferent between gambling and keeping the sure prospect at the various deci - sion nodes . As shown , for sufﬁciently low discount rates ( r (cid:6) 10 . 014 % ) , it is optimal to gamble in any regime at any decision node for both the FR and BR2 contestant types . As discounting increases , some of the gambles’ expected values fall below the sure prospects . In regimes 1 and 2 , discount rates must be very high ( above 22 % ) to discourage indi - viduals from gambling . This is because the $ 1 million annuity payments are only spread across 10 years and the consolation prize is substantial ( $ 25 , 000 ) . In regimes 3 and 4 , where annuities are paid over 20 – 25 years and the consolation prize is only $ 1 , 000 , lower discount rates may induce indi - viduals to take on various gambles . 3 All earnings are taxable . Given the amounts at stake , as long as marginal tax rates are constant over the annuity payments’ horizon , decisions should be tax - neutral . We also assume a constant inﬂation rate over the annuity horizon . Thus our discount rates may be interpreted as real discount rates . 4 A further possibility is that contestants are unaware of the annuity system , or that their decision frames are affected by the fact that $ 1 million winners are presented with a large symbolic check for that amount . 5 A variety of other decision problems involving time - delayed payoffs , but not streams of payoffs , actually show that individuals may overdis - count future payoffs . However , ﬁnancial companies openly advertise their readiness to convert lottery annuity payments into lump - sum payoffs at discount rates in the 8 % – 10 % range . Thus , overdiscounting appears unlikely in our problem . 6 The authors conducted an experiment to gain insight into this issue . The Hoosier Millionaire regime 4 decision problem was given as a ﬁnal exam question in two different courses : ﬁrst - year MBA Microeconomics and senior - level Risk Management and Insurance . Whereas the MBA students had been exposed to the concept of backward induction , seniors were mostly unfamiliar with it . Our results show that 8 ( 8 . 9 % ) of 90 MBA students and 7 ( 11 . 7 % ) of 60 seniors used backward induction to solve this problem . THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS 220 B . Risk Aversion 7 To make our results comparable with those of previous studies , we assume that Hoosier Millionaire contestants display one of the following two types of preferences : Constant Absolute Risk Aversion ( CARA ) . These prefer - ences , which imply increasing relative risk aversion , are often assumed in studies of individual decision - making . Their generic utility representation is U (cid:7) W (cid:8) (cid:1) (cid:1) e (cid:1) aW , ( 1 ) where W is the individual’s wealth , a is the coefﬁcient of absolute risk aversion , and aW is the coefﬁcient of relative risk aversion . This formulation is convenient because it allows one to calculate absolute risk - aversion coefﬁcients without any wealth information . Constant Relative Risk Aversion ( CRRA ) . These prefer - ences , which imply decreasing absolute risk aversion , are commonly used in macro and asset - pricing studies . Their generic utility representation is U (cid:7) W (cid:8) (cid:1) W 1 (cid:1) b 1 (cid:2) b , ( 2 ) where W is the individual’s wealth , b is the coefﬁcient of relative risk aversion , and b / W is the coefﬁcient of absolute risk aversion . Since this formulation implies that risk aver - sion depends on wealth , we must know something about that variable to make meaningful inferences . Given lack of comprehensive wealth information , we make alternative 7 It is well known that expected - utility theory fails to account for some empirical regularities in decision - making under uncertainty . The most impor - tant two violations relate to the decision - makers’ ( a ) asymmetric evaluations of gains and losses , and ( b ) use of decision weights instead of probabilities . The decisions we analyze are such that ( a ) is absent because there are no losses , and the inﬂuence of ( b ) should be minimal due to the simple probability structure of the gambles . In addition , the recent papers by Rabin ( 2000a , 2000b ) , and Rabin and Thaler ( 2001 ) conclude that risk - aversion results based on expected - utility theory are most accurate when they pertain to decisions involving large stakes , such as those in our games . Thus , we feel comfortable staying within the expected - utility framework . F IGURE 1 . —R EGIME 3 ( 1 ) N stands for nature ; (cid:1) and (cid:2) represent relevant subgames .

NOTES 221 assumptions about the reference wealth level that individu - als use to make decisions . We ﬁrst use a restrictive deﬁni - tion of wealth , W 0 , encompassing only the winnings accu - mulated in Hoosier Millionaire . This partial asset integration in decision - making is to some extent consistent with Kahneman and Tversky’s ( 1979 ) prospect theory . As a test of robustness we will also use a broader wealth deﬁni - tion ( W 1 ) , which includes the median household income of the individual’s census tract in 1990 . Table 2 shows the values for the CARA and CRRA ( W 0 ) parameters that make contestants indifferent between gam - bling and keeping the sure prospect on every initial sub - game in every regime of Hoosier Millionaire . That is , for any risk - aversion parameter larger than a given entry in this table , the contestant will prefer the sure prospect to the gamble . As expected , as discounting increases , the value of the $ 1 , 000 , 000 annuity payments becomes small relative to that of the lump - sum payoffs . Thus , at some discount rate the expected value of a gamble becomes smaller than the sure prospect , and the contestant would have to be a risk lover to gamble ( see the appropriate entries in table 2 when r (cid:4) 20 % and r (cid:4) 30 % ) . Also , for a given discount rate , the risk - aversion coefﬁcient that dissuades a contestant from gambling decreases with the amount of the sure prospect , regardless of the degree of contestant rationality . This fol - lows from certainty equivalence . IV . Data We obtained the Hoosier Millionaire data from the Hoo - sier Lottery ofﬁce in Indianapolis , and from press releases in the South Bend Tribune . With a few exceptions , our data set contains the winnings and census tract characteristics of all the participants in both phases of Hoosier Millionaire since its inception . Table 3 presents a summary of the contestants’ endoge - nous initial gambling decisions . 8 We also report mean phase I winnings and 1990 census tract median income ﬁgures for our sample . As seen in table 3 , although 58 % of the individuals in our sample take the initial gamble , this fraction varies across regimes . In fact , the rough compara - tive statics of decisions across regimes indicate that contes - tants respond correctly to changes in the award structure . For instance , in regime 1 the sizable consolation prize ( $ 25 , 000 ) substantially reduces the downside of gambling . As a result , all of the contestants in this regime choose to gamble . This contrasts with regime 3 , where the small consolation prize ( $ 1 , 000 ) makes the downside of gambling 8 We concentrate on the initial gambling decisions in view of the very limited number of individuals choosing to gamble more than once . In regimes 1 – 3 contestants face a compulsory ( exogenous ) initial gambling decision . Thus we consider only on the ( endogenous ) decisions after that compulsory stage . In contrast , all initial gambling decisions in regime 4 are endogenous .

THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS 222 rather onerous , thus inducing 40 of 45 contestants to keep the sure prospect . The fourth column of Table 3 shows phase 1 winnings for each contestant in our data set . As seen , there is not much variation in these winnings . We obtained the addresses of all phase 2 Hoosier Millionaire contestants , and found match - ing data from their 1990 census tracts . Table 3 also shows the average median family and per capita income for our sample . Although both of these income measures are below state averages , they are not signiﬁcantly different from them . 9 However , there is no systematic difference between the incomes of contestants that took the gambles and con - testants that chose the certain prospects . 10 V . Estimation A . Methodology Previous studies such as those of Gertner ( 1993 ) , Metrick ( 1995 ) , and Hersch and McDougall ( 1997 ) estimated the coefﬁcient of absolute risk aversion using a nonlinear probit approach . Unlike those studies , where individuals face gam - bles involving different stakes , each contestant within a regime of Hoosier Millionaire faces a gamble with identical stakes . Thus the probit technique is inappropriate , because a key source of variation—that between the sizes of the gambles—is absent . Instead , we use a probabilistic approach and estimate the distribution of the risk - aversion parameter . We assume that contestants are endowed with risk - aversion parameters that are independent draws from a normal population distribu - tion . 11 If a contestant’s realization of the risk - aversion pa - rameter is less than the value that yields indifference ( equal - ity of expected utilities from gambling and not gambling ) , she chooses the gamble . The probability that the contes - tant’s risk - aversion parameter lies below the indifference value is given by the value of the cumulative normal distribution evaluated at the indifference value . As we know , the normal distribution is determined by its mean and standard deviation . To estimate these parameters , we use the indifference values in table 2 and the binomial probabilities implied by the empirical frequencies in table 3 . We infer the mean and standard deviation as follows : Each subgame in the history of Hoosier Millionaire is associated with a CARA or CRRA indifference parameter , which we denote (cid:10) , and an observed frequency of taking the gamble , denoted p . We choose pairs of subgames , and solve for the ( unique ) values of the mean (cid:11) and standard deviation (cid:12) that satisfy the following system : (cid:2) (cid:1)(cid:13) (cid:10) 1 (cid:7) 2 (cid:14)(cid:12) 2 (cid:8) (cid:1) 1 / 2 e (cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:1) x (cid:8) 2 / 2 (cid:12) 2 dx (cid:1) p 1 , ( 3a ) (cid:2) (cid:1)(cid:13) (cid:10) 2 (cid:7) 2 (cid:14)(cid:12) 2 (cid:8) (cid:1) 1 / 2 e (cid:1)(cid:7)(cid:11)(cid:1) x (cid:8) 2 / 2 (cid:12) 2 dx (cid:1) p 2 . ( 3b ) We then used Monte Carlo simulations to place conﬁdence intervals around the estimated mean and standard deviation . For each Monte Carlo trial , we generated two data sets consisting of indicator random variables , and used the implied p ’s from these pseudo data to solve for (cid:11) and (cid:12) . The data - generating process for each set of indicator variables was a binomial distribution with parameter ( probability of success on each binomial trial ) equal to the observed p from the respective subgame . The number of observations in each set of pseudo data was set equal to the number of actual observations of the respective subgame . We repeated this experiment 1 , 000 times for each regime pair and behavioral 9 Hersch and McDougall ( 1997 ) note that the median income of Illinois lottery players is nearly identical to the statewide ﬁgure . Although no ﬁgures are presented to back this claim , its accuracy is subject to the same problem regarding the coarseness of variables within census tracts . 10 We also collected other census tract data for our contestant sample , like schooling , household size , and age . We do not show this information , due to its coarseness and insigniﬁcant interregime variation . 11 Although we choose a normal distribution for our analysis , the results are qualitatively similar if we use a one - parameter symmetric distribution , such as the logistic distribution . We do not know ex ante if risk - aversion parameters are symmetrically distributed among individuals , but we are unaware of hard evidence showing otherwise .

Although we performed this experiment using several pairs of subgames , we focus on the pairing of regimes 4 and 3 . 2 . 12 Table 4 reports estimated means and variances of the CARA and CRRA coefﬁcients for each behavioral assumption , along with the Monte Carlo - generated 90 % conﬁdence intervals . B . Results A feature of our results is their robustness across utility speciﬁcations . The parameter estimates for the CARA and CRRA ( W 0 ) functions yield similar distributions and exhibit comparable patterns . The following discussion makes use of this similarity by grouping the results from both speciﬁca - tions whenever possible . First , our results consistently support risk aversion . Esti - mated mean risk - aversion coefﬁcients are always positive , and the conﬁdence intervals around these means never include zero . Mean risk - aversion parameter estimates under CARA range from 4 . 8E (cid:1) 6 to 9 . 7E (cid:1) 6 , and those under CRRA range from 0 . 64 to 1 . 43 . Moreover , the minimum means implied by the Monte Carlo simulations are always positive . This evidence supports the hypothesis that on average , the individuals on our sample are risk - averse . However , the estimated standard deviations of the risk - aversion parameters indicate that some individuals may display risk - neutral or risk - loving preferences . This is par - ticularly the case for CRRA utility , where a signiﬁcant fraction of estimated risk - aversion parameters are nonposi - tive . A two - standard - deviation interval around the mean risk - aversion parameter generally includes only positive values for the CARA utility function but encompasses zero and negative values for the CRRA one . Our second main result is that different behavioral as - sumptions affect the estimates of mean risk aversion . For 12 Strictly speaking , the distribution parameters are overidentiﬁed , as there are several regime pairs that could be used to estimate them . However , the choice of regime pairs does not introduce major qualitative variations in the estimates . The similar results we obtained in the logistic case , which is not subject to the pairing problem , reinforce this point .

The CARA utility function is U ( W ) (cid:4) (cid:1) e (cid:1) aW , where W is the individual’s initial wealth and a is the risk - aversion parameter . The CRRA utility function is U ( W ) (cid:4) W 1 (cid:1) b / ( 1 (cid:1) b ) , where W is the individual’s initial wealth and b is the risk - aversion parameter . THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS 224 ﬁxed discounting , conﬁdence intervals for these means under full rationality ( FR ) and lack of backward induction ( BR2 and BR3 ) are mutually exclusive . In addition , when comparing no discounting and 10 % discounting , holding behavior ﬁxed , conﬁdence intervals are mutually exclusive in three of four cases . We discuss the direction and signif - icance of these differences in the next section . As a test of robustness of our CRRA results , we estimated the distribution parameters using a more inclusive deﬁnition of wealth ( W 1 ) . In this speciﬁcation , in addition to phase I winnings , the initial wealth also included the average me - dian income for the contestant’s census tract in 1990 . As we see in table 4 , the higher initial wealth uniformly increases the means and standard deviations of the CRRA parameter distributions . However , most of these increases are very small ( between 0 . 1 and 0 . 3 ) and , as we show in the next section , do not affect the basic interpretation of the results . The similarity between the two sets of CRRA estimates is due to the fact that that both wealth deﬁnitions are a small fraction of the stakes of the gambles in Hoosier Millionaire . 13 VI . Discussion and Conclusions The results from the previous section uniformly indicate that most individuals display some degree of risk aversion . To gain insight into the economic signiﬁcance of these results , we ﬁrst compare them with those obtained in related work . Our estimated means of the CARA parameter distri - butions are lower than the estimated CARA parameters of other game - show studies . Gertner ( 1993 ) , using two alter - native methods , estimates statistically signiﬁcant lower bounds on this parameter of 0 . 000310 or 0 . 0000711 . Met - rick ( 1995 ) and Hersch and McDougall ( 1997 ) report esti - mates ranging from 0 . 0000265 to 0 . 000066 , but these esti - mates are not statistically different from zero , leading to the conclusion of risk neutrality . In contrast , our largest esti - mated mean CARA parameter is 0 . 0000097 , and the largest upper bound on a conﬁdence interval is 0 . 000012 , both of which are nearly an order of magnitude smaller than those reported elsewhere . Our CRRA parameter estimates are also generally lower than those reported elsewhere . Friend and Blume ( 1975 ) , using data from individual portfolio holdings , ﬁnd estimates of this parameter ranging from 1 to 2 , while Chou , Engle , and Kane ( 1992 ) , in an asset - pricing context , estimate it to be around 3 . Beetsma and Schotman ( 2001 ) , using game data from LINGO , estimate it to be around 7 . In our case the mean CRRA parameters range from 0 . 64 to 1 . 76 , once again below most estimates from other studies . To gain some intuition into the meaning of our results and how they compare with those of other studies , we calculate certainty equivalents implied by our mean estimates for a variety of gambles ( see table 5 ) . For instance , for a gamble offering a 50 - 50 chance of winning nothing and $ 1 , 000 , the certainty equivalent ranges from $ 461 . 40 ( Gertner , 1993 ) to $ 496 . 73 ( Hersch and McDougall , 1997 ) , with most esti - mates implying a certainty equivalent above $ 490 . In our experiments , certainty equivalents implied by point esti - mates of the mean of the parameter distribution range from $ 491 . 26 to $ 499 . 40 . Thus for gambles of this magnitude , not only are our results similar to those in other studies , but they imply behavior close to risk neutrality . Moreover , the tightness of the range of these certainty equivalents indi - cates that the differences among risk aversion parameters across behavioral assumptions may not have much eco - nomic signiﬁcance when stakes like these are involved . In fact , as seen in table 5 , near - risk - neutrality across all be - haviors obtains even as stakes rise to several thousand dollars . This point , also emphasized on table 1 of Rabin and Thaler ( 2001 ) , suggests that gambles of this size unavoid - ably lead to parameter estimates that imply near - risk - neutrality within the expected utility paradigm . Thus , given that most previous studies based their estimates on gambles with maximum stakes around $ 20 , 000 , it is not surprising at all that the results point towards risk neutrality or mild risk aversion . 14 However , we estimated our risk - aversion parameters from decisions involving unusually high stakes . In fact , stakes in Hoosier Millionaire are much higher ( 20 times or more in most cases ) than those in any of the games analyzed in other studies . Thus , we must base our inferences on stakes of this magnitude . For instance , for a 50 - 50 gamble between winning nothing and $ 1 million , the certainty equivalents that our mean estimates imply range from $ 57 , 308 to $ 255 , 422 , indicating substantial risk aversion . Moreover , there is wide variation of certainty equivalents , depending on rationality assumptions . More pre - cisely , fully rational contestants display uniformly higher cer - tainty equivalents than all boundedly rational contestants , and contestants who do not backward - induct and fail to discount their payoffs display the lowest certainty equivalents . These facts suggest that the willingness to take on large gambles is inversely related to the extent of rationality of the contes - tant . Because boundedly rational contestants fail to take account of for the option value of continuing to make decisions , their perceived expected utility of gambling is below that of a fully rational contestant . Table 5 also reports the CEs associated with two intermediate gambles , which show how risk aversion starts to surface more dramatically as the stakes grow larger . 13 The income statistics are from the 1990 census ( 1989 ﬁgures ) , whereas the gambling ﬁgures are from 1992 – 1998 . Although post - 1989 contestant census tract ﬁgures are not available , the income variation within this period is not signiﬁcant enough to meaningfully affect our CRRA estimates or its interpretation . For instance , median household income in Indiana was $ 31 , 776 in 1995 , indicating only a modest nominal increase of 10 . 35 % relative to 1989 . 14 The high risk - aversion parameters estimated by Beetsma and Schot - man ( 2001 ) are an exception . Given the relatively small average stakes of their gambles ( around $ 1500 ) , it is possible that the subjective elements involved in their decisions are inﬂuencing their estimates . NOTES 225 What can we learn from these results ? First , one should be very careful in drawing general conclusions about pref - erences from context - speciﬁc estimates . In our case , when taken in the context of previous studies , our estimates point towards very mild risk aversion . However , once we account for the actual context of our estimation , the results indicate substantial risk aversion . Thus , the recent claims in Rabin ( 2000a , 2000b ) and Rabin and Thaler ( 2001 ) about the limited applicability of expected - utility theory when stakes are small should be taken very seriously . Second , not only does the size of the stakes affect risk - aversion inferences , but it is also very important in helping us distinguish across behaviors in decision - making problems . As we showed , estimates based on small stakes may yield decision rules that are economically indistinguishable for fully rational and boundedly rational decision - makers . Only at high stakes are these behavioral differences clearly observable . Finally , a common criticism of ﬁeld - study data pertains to the selection of participating subjects . It is possible that indi - viduals participating in these games are in some sense different from the rest of the population . The evidence presented here and also in Hersch and McDougall ( 1997 ) suggests that this is not the case with regard to observable characteristics . How - ever , our contestant sample is more likely to be selected from individuals who are heavy lottery ticket buyers . Thus our results can be interpreted as providing a quasi lower bound on the mean risk - aversion parameter for the population at large .

THE SMALL - SAMPLE BIAS OF THE GINI COEFFICIENT : RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR EMPIRICAL RESEARCH George Deltas * Abstract —The Gini coefﬁcient is a downward - biased measure of inequal - ity in small populations when income is generated by one of three common distributions . The paper discusses the sources of bias and argues that this property is far more general . This has implications for ( i ) the comparison of inequality among subsamples , some of which may be small , and ( ii ) the use of the Gini in measuring ﬁrm size inequality in markets with a small number of ﬁrms . The small - sample bias has often led to misperceptions about trends in industry concentration . A small - sample adjustment results in a reduced bias , which can no longer be signed . This remaining bias rises with the dispersion and falls with increasing skewness of the distribution . Finally , an empirical example illustrates the importance of using the adjusted Gini . In this example it is shown that , controlling for market characteristics , larger shipping cartels include a set of ﬁrms that is stochastically identical ( in terms of relative size ) to those of smaller shipping cartels . I . Introduction T HIS paper shows that the Gini coefﬁcient statistic exhibits a signiﬁcant small - sample bias . The Gini co - efﬁcient of a large population estimated from a small sam - ple will be substantially smaller than the Gini of the entire population . Similarly , the Gini of a small population will be smaller than the Gini of a larger population generated by the Received for publication January 28 , 2000 .
