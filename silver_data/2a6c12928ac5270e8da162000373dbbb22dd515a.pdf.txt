As cell motility is regulated by actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and is required for tumor invasion and metastasis , blocking actin polymerization may be an effective strategy to prevent tumor dissemina - tion . We show that WAVEs , especially WAVE2 , are essential for invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells . Malignant B16F10 mouse melanoma cells expressed more WAVE1 and WAVE2 proteins and showed higher Rac activity than B16 parental cells , which are neither invasive nor metastatic . The effect of WAVE2 silencing by RNA interference ( RNAi ) on the highly invasive nature of B16F10 cells was more dramatic than that of WAVE1 RNAi . Membrane rufﬂing , cell motility , invasion into the extracellular matrix , and pulmonary metastasis of B16F10 cells were suppressed by WAVE2 RNAi . WAVE2 RNAi also had a profound effect on invasion induced by a constitutively active form of Rac ( RacCA ) . In addition , ectopic expression of both RacCA and WAVE2 in B16 cells resulted in further increase in the invasiveness than that observed in B16 cells expressing only RacCA . Thus , WAVE2 acts as the primary effector downstream of Rac to achieve invasion and metastasis , suggesting that suppression of WAVE2 activity holds a promise for preventing cancer invasion and metastasis .

It is clear that tumor invasion is a complex process involving several strate - gies , including mesenchymal movement and amoeboid movement , to migrate through tissues ( Friedl and Wolf , 2003 ) . Cell migration through the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) begins with the formation of cell protrusions that contain ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) and recognize the external environment , and this is a common feature of invasion . Thus , it may be possible to control the invasive and metastatic phenotypes of cancer cells by manipulating proteins involved in formation of such protrusions . Various regulators of the actin cytoskele - ton , including Tiam1 ( Michiels et al . , 1995 ) , cortactin ( Li et al . , 2001 ) , and LIM kinase ( Yoshioka et al . , 2003 ) , are involved in acquisition of the invasive and metastatic phenotypes . Ras family GTPases are involved in the metastatic phenotype through regulation of cellular motility and invasiveness ( Sahai and Marshall , 2002 ) . In particular , Rho - subfamily proteins are critical in the regulation of cell shape and motility . Ras oncoproteins promote proliferation , block apoptosis , and confer the invasive and metastatic phenotypes to tumor cells . Rho family GTPases are thought to be the downstream effectors responsible for the Ras - induced invasive and metastatic phenotypes , and recent studies showed that Ras regulates expression and activation of Rho family proteins through several signal transduction pathways ( De Corte et al . , 2002 ; Vial et al . , 2003 ) . RhoA regulates stress ﬁber formation and focal adhesion assembly that results in actomyosin contractility and contraction at the rear of the cell , which leads to translocation of the cell body ( Chrzanowska - Wodnicka and Burridge , 1996 ; Maekawa et al . , 1999 ) . Rac1 activates actin polymeriza - tion through WASP family verprolin - homologous pro - teins ( WAVE ) and Arp2 / 3 complex leading to formation of membrane rufﬂes that push the cell membrane forward ( Takenawa and Miki , 2001 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2002a ) . Although WAVEs have been shown to be involved in morphogenesis and motility of cells and in embryonic development of mice ( Soderling et al . , 2003 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ; Yamazaki et al . , 2003 ; Yan et al . , 2003 ) , their roles in cancer invasion and metastasis remain unclear . In the present study , we used a B16 murine melanoma model to explore the role of WAVEs downstream of Received 22 April 2004 ; revised 7 September 2004 ; accepted 7 September 2004 ; published online 20 December 2004 * Correspondence : T Takenawa ; E - mail : takenawa @ ims . u - tokyo . ac . jp Oncogene ( 2005 ) 24 , 1309 – 1319 & 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved 0950 - 9232 / 05 $ 30 . 00 www . nature . com / onc Rac in cancer cell invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo and found that Rac - WAVE2 signaling is essential for in vitro invasion of B16 melanoma cells and that WAVE2 is involved in metastasis in vivo . Results Expression analysis of B16 melanoma cell lines To examine whether WAVEs are involved in cancer invasion and metastasis , we analysed expression of these proteins in a B16 mouse model of melanoma ( Fidler , 1973 ) comprising nonmetastatic B16 parental melanoma cells , low - metastatic B16F1 cells , and highly metastatic B16F10 cells . As actin cytoskeleton dynamics are important in invasion and metastasis , we compared expression of proteins that regulate the actin cytoskele - ton among these cell lines ( Figure 1a ) . Expression of WAVE1 and WAVE2 increased as metastatic ability increased . Densitometric analyses revealed that WAVE1 and WAVE2 levels were increased 2 . 8 - and 1 . 5 - fold , respectively , in B16F10 cells in comparison to levels in B16 cells ( Figure 1a ) . WAVE3 was not expressed in these cell lines ( data not shown ) . Levels of N - WASP , a WASP family protein downstream of Cdc42 and Src family kinases ( Miki et al . , 1998a ; Suetsugu et al . , 2002b ) , were not changed . Expression of Arp2 , a WASP family effector , was not changed . Next , we examined WAVE1 levels relative to WAVE2 levels in B16F10 cells ( Figure 1b ) . As it is difﬁcult to purify WAVE isoforms , we utilized GFP - tagged WAVEs as external standards instead of directly comparing WAVE1 / WAVE2 using puriﬁed proteins . The amount of exogenously expressed green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged WAVE1 was 28 % of the amount of the endogenous WAVE1 as assessed by densitometry , and the amount of GFP - tagged WAVE2 was 71 % of the amount of the endogenous WAVE2 . To compare levels of ectopically expressed WAVE1 and WAVE2 , we used anti - GFP antibody , which reacts with GFP - tagged WAVE . The amount of GFP - WAVE1 expressed was 36 % of that of GFP - WAVE2 . Therefore , the amount of endogenous WAVE1 was calculated to be 90 % of that of endogen - ous WAVE2 in B16F10 cells . Endogenous expression and activity of small GTPases Rac1 , Cdc42 , and RhoA , were examined by pull - down assays with GST - fused Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding ( CRIB ) domain of PAK1 ( PAK - CRIB for Rac1 ) , GST - fused CRIB domain of N - WASP ( N - WASP - CRIB for Cdc42 ) , and GST - fused Rho - binding domain ( RBD ) of Rhotekin ( Rhotekin - RBD for RhoA ) ( Figure 1c ) . In B16F10 cells , expression of these GTPases was not changed in comparison to that in B16 cells . Levels of active Rac1 ( Rac1 - GTP ) were elevated 2 . 7 - fold as determined by densitometry ( P o 10 (cid:1) 4 , Student’s t - test ) , whereas levels of Cdc42 - GTP were reduced ( 32 % of the level of B16 cells , P o 0 . 02 ) and RhoA - GTP were not changed . These results suggest that Rac - WAVE signaling may be involved in malignancy of B16 melanoma cells . Subcellular localization of WAVE1 and WAVE2 To analyse the functions of endogenous WAVEs in cancer cells , we performed immunocytochemistry of B16 and B16F10 melanoma cells cultured on Matrigel with antibodies speciﬁc for WAVE1 and WAVE2 ( Figure 2 ) . B16 and B16F10 cells seeded on glass - bottom dishes migrated with a polarized morphology in which a rufﬂe structure developed toward the direction of movement ( data not shown ) . We counted cells with this polarized morphology as motile ( Figure 2a ) . In comparison to B16 cells , B16F10 cells were highly motile and showed numerous polarized rufﬂes . Although the polarized rufﬂes at the leading edges of B16 cells were somewhat ﬂattened ( upper illustration , Figure 2a ) , B16F10 cells had numerous rufﬂe structures toward the dorsal side of Figure 1 Protein expression in B16 melanoma cell lines . ( a ) Expression of WASP family proteins in B16 , B16F1 and B16F10 cells . Relative expression ( fold 7 s . d . ) of WAVE1 , WAVE2 and N - WASP is indicated below the blots . Anti - pan - WAVE antibody was used to detect WAVE1 , WAVE2 and WAVE3 . ( b ) Comparison of levels of endogenous WAVE1 and WAVE2 in B16F10 cells . GFP - tagged WAVEs were expressed , and WAVE1 expression relative to WAVE2 expression was calculated from the ratio of respective band intensities shown on the blot . ( c ) Pull - down assay to detect GTP - loaded ( active ) small GTPases in B16 and B16F10 cells . Rac1 - GTP , Cdc42 - GTP and RhoA - GTP were pulled down with the indicated GST - fused GTPase binding motif as shown by Western blotting on the right . Relative amount of active forms of respective GTPases ( fold 7 s . d . ) was indicated below the blots WAVEs in invasion and metastasis S Kurisu et al 1310 Oncogene the cell in addition to the peripheral rufﬂes . We characterized this morphology as aberrant rufﬂing ( bottom illustration , Figure 2a ) , and B16F10 cells had more aberrant rufﬂes than B16 cells do ( Figure 2b , P o 0 . 0005 ; the criteria to distinguish between these two types of rufﬂes were described in statistics section of Materials and methods ) . It is likely that malignant B16F10 cells are highly motile due to increased rufﬂing . In B16 and B16F10 melanoma cells , WAVE1 was co - localized with F - actin in both peripheral and aberrant rufﬂes ( Figure 2c ) . WAVE2 was also concentrated in membrane rufﬂes but was localized at the tips of both peripheral and aberrant rufﬂes ( Figure 2d and 5g ) . Cytosolic signals for WAVE2 were weaker than those of WAVE1 , suggesting that WAVE2 functions at the very front of actin - rich protrusions and may have a distinct role in membrane extension . Figure 2 WAVE1 and WAVE2 localization in membrane rufﬂes in B16 and B16F10 cells . ( a ) Schematic representation of polarized membrane rufﬂe morphology divided into ‘peripheral rufﬂes’ and ‘aberrant rufﬂes’ as shown in the box . ( b ) Membrane rufﬂe morphologies of B16 and B16F10 cells cultured on Matrigel were analyzed and are expressed as the percentage of cells with polarized rufﬂing ( percentage 7 s . d . ) .

Note that WAVE2 is concentrated at the very front of peripheral and aberrant rufﬂes shown in the magniﬁed image WAVEs in invasion and metastasis S Kurisu et al 1311 Oncogene WAVE2 is essential for membrane rufﬂe formation in B16F10 cells downstream of Rac1 As shown in Figure 2 , malignant B16F10 cells had numerous polarized rufﬂes , especially aberrant rufﬂes , in comparison to B16 cells . Rac1 activity in B16F10 cells was higher than that in B16 cells ( Figure 1c ) . Thus , we examined whether Rac1 activation is responsible for the morphological changes between B16 and B16F10 cells . B16 cells ectopically expressing a constitutive - active mutant of Rac1 , Rac1G12 V ( RacCA ) , formed large aberrant rufﬂes in addition to peripheral rufﬂes ( Figure 3a , upper panel ) compared to empty - vector transfected controls . In contrast , expression of a dominant - negative mutant of Rac1 , Rac1T17N ( RacDN ) , eliminated formation of both rufﬂe structures in B16F10 cells ( Figure 3a , bottom panel ) . These results suggest that Rac1 regulates formation of both rufﬂe types and that increased Rac1 activity caused aberrant membrane rufﬂing . We next examined how WAVE proteins function in membrane rufﬂing of B16F10 melanoma cells . We constructed RNAi vectors that target WAVE1 and WAVE2 . B16F10 cells were transfected twice , and production of WAVE1 and WAVE2 were reduced by 80 % of the values of the vector - only transfectant by 48 – 120 h after transfection ( Figure 3b ) . Transient transfection efﬁciency was approximately 70 – 80 % ( data not shown ) . With WAVE1 RNAi , formation of aberrant rufﬂes was reduced ( Figure 3c and d , P o 0 . 005 ) . The numbers of cells with peripheral rufﬂes was not signiﬁcantly different from those with empty - vector transfectants . However , WAVE2 RNAi dramatically reduced forma - tion of both membrane rufﬂe structures ( Figure 3c and d , P o 0 . 0005 for aberrant rufﬂes , P o 0 . 04 for peripheral rufﬂes ) . These results suggest that WAVE1 contributes to formation of aberrant rufﬂe structures but that it is not essential for formation of polarized membrane rufﬂes , including peripheral rufﬂes . In contrast , WAVE2 is necessary for formation of both types of rufﬂes resulting in polarized membrane rufﬂe formation and may be a decisive regulator of cell motility . WAVEs , especially WAVE2 , act downstream of Rac for B16 and B16F10 melanoma invasion WAVEs , especially WAVE2 , are necessary for polarized membrane rufﬂe formation , which is required for cell motility , suggesting that WAVEs may be involved in cancer cell invasion . We used a Boyden chamber assay Figure 3 WAVE2 is essential for membrane rufﬂes of B16 cell lines .

( d ) Membrane rufﬂe morphology of B16F10 cells when WAVE proteins are silenced , as described in Figure 2d WAVEs in invasion and metastasis S Kurisu et al 1312 Oncogene to quantify invasion into reconstituted basement mem - brane ( Matrigel ) . B16F10 cells were highly invasive in comparison to nonmetastatic B16 cells ( Figure 4a , P o 0 . 02 ) . Low metastatic B16F1 cells were comparable in the in vitro invasive activity to B16F10 cells ( Figure 4a ) , and in vitro invasive activity of a B16 model was likely to correlate with WAVE expression . Invasion of B16F10 cells was reduced to approximately 20 % that of the vector transfectant by WAVE2 RNAi and to approximately 70 % that of controls by WAVE1 RNAi ( Figure 4a , not signiﬁcant for WAVE1 RNAi , P o 0 . 02 for WAVE2 RNAi ) . These results indicate that WAVE proteins are required for melanoma invasion into Matrigel and that WAVE2 is a dominant regulator of melanoma invasion . Rac activity was increased in B16F10 cells in comparison to activity in B16 cells ( Figure 1c ) . Non - invasive B16 cells expressing RacCA showed increased invasion into Matrigel ( Figure 4d , P o 0 . 01 ) . In addition , transient expression of RacCA or RacDN , respectively , promoted or suppressed invasion by B16F10 cells ( Figure 4b , P o 0 . 004 for RacCA , P o 0 . 005 for RacDN ) . In contrast , Cdc42 activity was decreased in B16F10 cells ( Figure 1c ) . Transient expression of constitutive active forms of Cdc42 ( Cdc42CA ) or dominant - negative forms of Cdc42 ( Cdc42DN ) did not alter invasive activity of B16F10 cells ( Figure 4b ) , suggesting B16F10 cell invasion into Matrigel is not substantially regulated by Cdc42 . We next examined whether the increased invasive activity of RacCA - expressing cells was affected by WAVE levels . RNAi of WAVE1 and WAVE2 inhibited Rac - induced invasion by B16F10 cells ( Figure 4c , P o 0 . 02 for WAVE1 RNAi , P o 0 . 0002 for WAVE2 RNAi ) , indicating that WAVEs , especially WAVE2 , are involved in melanoma invasion down - stream of Rac1 . Although the Rho - Rock signaling pathway is in - volved in cancer cell invasion in parallel with Rac ( Sahai and Marshall , 2003 ; Vial et al . , 2003 ) , a Rock inhibitor , Y27632 , did not alter the invasive phenotype of B16F10 cells ( Figure 4b ) , indicating that the Rac pathway predominates in B16F10 cell invasion . Figure 4 Rac - dependent invasion of B16F10 cells is inhibited by decreased expression of WAVEs , especially WAVE2 . Cells that had migrated to the undersurfaces of the membranes in modiﬁed Boyden chambers were counted . The number obtained from control samples ( B16F10 cells , and B16F10 cells or B16 cells transfected with empty vectors ) was set as 1 , and the relative number is indicated . Error bars represent s . d . ( a ) Matrigel invasion assays of B16 cells , B16F1 cells , B16F10 cells and B16F10 cells transfected with the indicated RNAi vectors were performed . ( b ) Matrigel invasion assay of B16F10 cells expressing RacDN or RacCA ( left panel ) , and of those expressing Cdc42DN or Cdc42CA ( center panel ) were performed , and the effect of a Rho - kinase inhibitor , Y27632 , on the invasive behavior of B16F10 cells was also examined ( right panel ) . PBS - treated cells were used as a control . ( c ) Suppressive effects of decreased expression of WAVEs on Matrigel invasion were examined in RacCA - induced invasion of B16F10 cells . ( d ) Invasion of B16 cells exogenously expressing RacCA , WAVE2 , or both was examined WAVEs in invasion and metastasis S Kurisu et al 1313 Oncogene To gain insight into increased expression of WAVEs in B16 model , we overexpressed WAVE2 ( GFP - WAVE2 ) with or without RacCA in noninvasive B16 cells ( Figure 4d ) . Although overexpression of WAVE2 alone did not give signiﬁcant change in invasion of B16 cells ( GFP - WAVE2 þ vector ) , co - expression of WAVE2 and RacCA further increased invasion of B16 cells than expression of RacCA did ( Figure 4d , P o 0 . 03 ) . These results suggest that WAVE2 is activated downstream of Rac1 to promote B16 cell invasion and that both increased activity of Rac1 and higher expression of WAVE2 in B16F10 cells synergistically contribute to the highly invasive phenotype of this cell line . Invasive motility of B16F10 cells in ECM was inhibited by WAVE2 RNAi To conﬁrm that B16F10 cells invade the ECM via force generated by WAVE - dependent rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton , we performed gel - overlay assays and analyzed the movement of cells . Motility of cells on a 2D substrate does not necessarily correlate with motility in ECM ( Hsia et al . , 2003 ) . The gel - overlay method ( Connolly et al . , 2002 ) provides cells with a semi - 3D environment and permits observation of cells of interest . B16F10 cells cultured in this manner adopt a speciﬁc morphology that differs from that observed on a 2D substrate . With gel overlay , the cells assumed an elongated bipolar morphology , formed localized mem - brane rufﬂes at the leading edge ( Figure 5a ) , and gradually migrated and adhered to each other forming a mesh - like network . In contrast , cells on a 2D substrate migrated with broad membrane rufﬂes and maintained the ﬂattened morphology . Therefore , we believe that the morphology observed with Matrigel reﬂects that in a 3D environment . We observed B16F10 cells by time - lapse video microscopy to examine invasion of the Matrigel ( Figure 5b , see Supplementary Movie S1 , S2 and S3 ) . Movement of vector - transfected B16F10 cells in Ma - trigel was associated with formation of peripheral rufﬂes and aberrant rufﬂes ( Figure 2c and d ) . In contrast , WAVE2 RNAi caused complete loss of membrane rufﬂes , and cells did not invade the Matrigel . However , continuous extension and retraction of small pseudopo - dia was observed ( Supplementary Movie S3 ) . The effect of WAVE1 RNAi was limited , possibly because WAVE1 does not have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on formation of rufﬂes . We then examined invasion velocity by tracking the movement of cells and measur - ing the length of the path ( Figure 5c and d ) . WAVE1 RNAi decreased velocity slightly ( Figure 5e , not signiﬁcant ) , whereas WAVE2 RNAi dramatically in - hibited movement in Matrigel ( Figure 5e , cells with WAVE2 RNAi showed 70 % decrease in velocity in comparison to vector transfectants , P o 10 (cid:1) 8 ) . Similar results were obtained with dominant - negative mutants of WAVE1 and WAVE2 that lack the V domain ( WAVE1 D V and WAVE2 D V ) and cannot stimulate actin polymerization ( Suetsugu et al . , 1999 ) ( Figure 5f , P o 0 . 0005 for WAVE2 D V ) . These results suggest that loss of WAVE protein leads to reduced cell motility . Localization of WAVEs in cells in a 3D environment was examined with EGFP - tagged WAVEs and time - lapse live microscopic imaging ( Figure 5g ) . WAVE1 was localized at aberrant rufﬂes that formed toward the dorsal sides of WAVE1 - expressing cells . The aberrant rufﬂes appeared and disappeared very quickly ( within 2 min ) in the direction of move - ment , while the leading edge of the cell gradually extended forward . In contrast , WAVE2 was localized at the tips of protruding lamellipodia that formed toward the direction of movement . The signal for WAVE1 at lamellipodial tips was weaker than that at aberrant rufﬂes . These data suggest that WAVE2 has an essential role at the leading edge of invading cells . Interestingly , only WAVE2 was localized at the growing tips of ﬁlopodia ( Figure 5g , arrowheads ) , suggesting that WAVE2 functions at the front edge of membrane protrusions that form rigid ﬁlopodial structures and lamellipodial structures . Decreased WAVE2 expression suppressed pulmonary metastasis of B16F10 cells We then investigated the functions of WAVEs in metastasis in vivo with an experimental mouse model of metastasis ( Figure 6 ) . When B16F10 cells were injected intravenously , they metastasized to the lungs and formed black spherical colonies ( Figure 6a ) . We injected B16F10 cells into 5 - to 7 - week - old female C57BL / 6 mice , which have the same genetic background as B16 cells , with WAVE expression decreased by RNAi . At 2 weeks after injection , colonization of the lung by B16F10 cells was observed in vector transfec - tants and in cells with WAVE1 RNAi . In contrast , WAVE2 RNAi suppressed metastasis of B16F10 cells to the lungs ( Figure 6a and b , P o 0 . 002 ) . These ﬁndings are consistent with our in vitro observations that WAVE2 is necessary for motility of B16F10 cells in the ECM , suggesting that WAVE2 suppression may be an effective means to block invasion and metastasis . Discussion In comparison to nonmetastatic B16 cells , B16F10 cells show increased Rac1 activity and expression of WAVEs ( Figure 1 ) , indicating possible involvement of Rac - WAVE signaling in malignant conversion of melanoma . Although Rac1 activity affects both membrane rufﬂing and invasion of Matrigel by B16 and B16F10 cells ( Figure 3a , 4b and d ) , overexpression of WAVE1 or WAVE2 in B16 cells by itself did not affect rufﬂing morphology or invasiveness ( Figure 4d and data not shown ) . However , co - expression of RacCA and WAVE2 synergistically upregulate in vitro invasion of B16 cells ( Figure 4d ) , suggesting that both increased Rac1 activity and high levels of activated WAVEs are necessary for acquisition of invasiveness . We also found WAVEs in invasion and metastasis S Kurisu et al 1314 Oncogene that Cdc42 activity was decreased in B16F10 cells . Ectopic expression of Cdc42CA or Cdc42DN , however , did not affect B16F10 cells with respect to the invasiveness as reported in other malignant melanoma cells ( Bartolome et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , Cdc42 activity may participate in some steps of metastasis other than invasion , such as tumor growth control ( Molnar et al . , 1997 ; Takenaka et al . , 1998 ; Aguirre - Ghiso et al . , 2003 ) . When WAVE1 and WAVE2 expression were reduced in B16F10 cells by RNAi , WAVE2 was found to be necessary for membrane rufﬂing , Rac - induced invasion , and metastasis . WAVE1 appears to have little effect on these cellular behaviors , even though the endogenous level of expression is similar to that of WAVE2 ( Figure 1b ) . Inhibition of WAVE2 function reduced motility of B16F10 cells in Matrigel , and WAVE2 was concentrated at the very front of migrating cells ( Figure 5 ) . Therefore , we conclude that WAVE2 is the primary effector of Rac1 for cell motility and invasion through activation of actin polymerization at the tips of membrane protrusions . We recently reported that mouse embryonic ﬁbro - blasts ( MEFs ) derived from WAVE2 knockout mice show more severe defects in peripheral rufﬂes and migration than those from WAVE1 knockout mice ( Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ) . Another group reported that Figure 5 Time - lapse observation reveals that the anti - invasive effects of WAVE RNAi are due to reduced motility in ECM .

White arrows indicate peripheral rufﬂes , and black arrows indicate aberrant rufﬂes . Arrowheads indicate ﬁlopodia . Bars , 20 m m WAVEs in invasion and metastasis S Kurisu et al 1315 Oncogene lysates from WAVE2 knockout MEFs , which express other isoforms of WAVEs , do not show Rac - induced in vitro actin polymerization ( Yan et al . , 2003 ) . In these MEFs , WAVE2 and WAVE1 play roles in cell migra - tion in ECM . Consistent with B16 cell lines , peripheral rufﬂes are regulated by WAVE2 and dorsal rufﬂes , which occur at the upward direction of cells as aberrant rufﬂes in B16 cells , are regulated by WAVE1 . Thus , WAVE1 and WAVE2 appear to play similar roles in MEFs and B16 cells ; however , the role of WAVE1 is more limited in B16 cells than in MEFs , especially in cell migration in ECM . The difference might be from the differential usage of proteases because B16 cells migrate in ECM in the presence of a protease inhibitor ( GM6001 ) ( data not shown ) , whereas migration of MEFs was inhibited by a protease inhibitor . Recently , inhibition of Rac activity has been evalu - ated as a possible method for cancer treatment ( Joyce and Cox , 2003 ; Menna et al . , 2003 ) . Rac is thought to induce tumor invasion by activating several downstream signals . The highly motile phenotype of tumor cells may be induced by actin cytoskeleton remodeling via Rac - WAVE pathway as shown in the present study . Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) are activated via the c - Jun NH2 - terminal kinase pathway downstream of Rac ( Zhuge and Xu , 2001 ; Hsia et al . , 2003 ) . However , some MMP inhibitors developed for anticancer treat - ment do not appear to have therapeutic efﬁcacy in advanced cancer ( Zucker et al . , 2000 ) . This may be due to the fact that some aggressive tumor cells can migrate and disseminate independent of protease activity ( Wolf et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore , proteins such as WAVE2 that are involved in cell motility may be novel targets for chemotherapies . There are several events in which WAVE2 may be necessary . The colonization cascade in lungs begins with attachment of tumor cells to endothelial cells of microvessels . Tumor cells then extend pseudopods into the subendothelial matrix and penetrate the endothelial linings to adhere to the basement membrane . Finally , tumor cells extravasate with dissolution of the basement membrane ( Voura et al . , 1998 ) . It is possible that WAVE proteins are involved in several of these steps . In a B16 model , WAVE expression levels and in vitro invasiveness of B16F1 cells are similar to those of B16F10 cells , even though there is great difference in metastatic capacity between these two cell lines . This inconsistency might reﬂect the fact that successful metastasis depends upon numerous genetic and bio - chemical requirements in addition to activation of WAVEs ( Yu and Schultz , 1990 ; Clark et al . , 2000 ; Hanahan and Weinberg , 2000 ; Ortega et al . , 2003 ) . WAVE - promoted cellular invasiveness is one of the requirements , which is demonstrated by the fact that WAVE2 - RNAi impaired lung metastasis of B16F10 cells ( Figure 6 ) and that transduction of dominant - negative Rac in B16F10 cells inhibits lung metastasis ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2003 ) . However , we could not elicit the exact role of WAVE function in the complex metastatic process , for instance , as seen in slight increase in metastasis nodules of B16F10 cells treated with WAVE1 - RNAi and further studies are needed to determine the precise roles of WAVEs in these processes . Materials and methods Cell lines The B16 , B16F1 , and B16F10 mouse melanoma cell lines ( Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research , Tohoku University , Sendai , Japan ) were used . B16 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) ( Nissui , Tokyo , Japan ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) and antibiotics ( penicillin and streptomycin ) and maintained in a humidiﬁed 5 % CO 2 atmosphere at 37 1 C . Figure 6 Pulmonary metastasis of B16F10 cells is suppressed by WAVE2 RNAi . ( a ) Representative appearance of murine lungs with metastasized colonies ( visible as black lentigo - like dots ) of B16F10 cells 2 weeks after intravenous injection . ( b ) Colony numbers in lungs were counted , and WAVE2 - suppressed cells showed a signiﬁcant reduction in colony formation . The number of mice used in each experiment is indicated at the bottom . Error bars represent s . e . m WAVEs in invasion and metastasis S Kurisu et al 1316 Oncogene Antibodies and DNA constructs Anti - pan - WAVE ( Miki et al . , 1998b ) , anti - WAVE1 and anti - WAVE2 ( Yamazaki et al . , 2003 ) , and anti - N - WASP ( Miki et al . , 1996 ) antibodies were described previously . Anti - Arp2 polyclonal antibody was prepared in rabbits immunized with a synthetic peptide ( TANA Laboratories , Houston , TX , USA ) corresponding to the carboxy - terminal region ( amino acids 577 – 591 ) of human Arp2 . Mouse anti - Rac monoclonal anti - body was a generous gift from Dr T Azuma of Keio University Medical School ( Tokyo , Japan ) . The following antibodies were obtained from commercial sources : rabbit anti - green ﬂuores - cent protein antiserum ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) , mouse anti - actin monoclonal antibody ( # MAB1501 , Chemi - con , Temecula , CA , USA ) , rabbit anti - c - Myc polyclonal antibody A - 14 , rabbit anti - Cdc42 polyclonal antibody P - 1 and mouse anti - RhoA monoclonal antibody 26C4 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) . pEF - BOS constructs ( Myc - Rac1G12 V , Myc - Rac1T17N , Myc - Cdc42G12V and Myc - Cdc42T17N ) were described pre - viously ( Takaishi et al . , 1997 ; Miki et al . , 1998b ) . pEGFP - WAVE1 and pEGFP - WAVE2 ( Nozumi et al . , 2003 ) were generous gifts from Dr H Nakagawa of Kyushu Institute of Technology ( Fukuoka , Japan ) . pIRES2 - EF - EGFP - WA - VE1 D V and pIRES2 - EF - EGFP - WAVE2 D V were constructed as follows . The coding sequence for the EF promoter was ampliﬁed from pEF - BOS plasmids by PCR , and the EF promoter fragment was inserted before IRES - GFP cassette to generate pIRES - EF - EGFP . cDNA fragments of WAVE1 D V or WAVE2 D V ( Suetsugu et al . , 1999 ) , which lack the verprolin - homology domain of human WAVE1 or WAVE2 , respectively , were excised from pEF - BOS constructs and inserted into pIRES2 - EF - EGFP vector . RNA interference ( RNAi ) Silencing of WAVE1 and WAVE2 by RNAi was carried out with pSUPER vector as described previously ( Brummelkamp et al . , 2002 ) . WAVE1 RNAi was described previously ( Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ) . For WAVE2 RNAi , candidate small interfering RNA sequences were compared against mouse genomic sequences by BLAST searches to ensure that WAVE2 was the only sequence targeted . The sequence used for the experiments described herein was 5 0 - AAG TGCCTTTGCCTCCCGAGT - 3 0 for WAVE2 ( nt 174 – 194 relative to the start codon ) . Cells were transfected with 1 . 6 m g of each pSUPER construct with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitro - gen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . To obtain a sufﬁcient level of suppression by RNAi , we carried out a second transfection at 24h after the ﬁrst . Transfection efﬁciency was checked by transfection of pEGFP - N3 vector ( BD Clontech ) , and the typical proportion of cells expressing EGFP was 70 – 80 % for B16F10 melanoma cells ( data not shown ) . Cell lysates were collected 72h after the second transfection , and suppression of WAVE1 and WAVE2 was conﬁrmed by Western blotting . For experiments with RNAi vectors , cells were collected for assays 48 – 72h after the second transfection . Invasion assay Tumor cell invasiveness was determined as described pre - viously but with slight modiﬁcations ( Kobayashi et al . , 1992 ) . In brief , the undersurfaces of the porous membranes in the Matrigel Invasion Chambers ( # 35 - 4480 ; BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) were coated with ﬁbronectin ( # F - 1141 , 25 m g / ml in PBS ; Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) at room temperature for 1 h and washed in DMEM containing 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin ( DMEM - BSA ) three times . DMEM - BSA was added to the lower compartment of the chamber . Cells starved in DMEM - BSA overnight were trypsinized brieﬂy and collected , and then 200 m l of cell suspension ( 2 (cid:4) 10 5 cells / ml in DMEM - BSA ) was added to the upper compartment of the chamber and incubated at 37 1 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 for 24h . Cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab , and cells that had migrated to the under surface of the membrane were ﬁxed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBS , stained with crystal violet ( 0 . 4 % dissolved in 10 % ethanol ; Wako , Osaka , Japan ) for 15 min , washed twice with PBS , and counted under a phase - contrast microscope with a 10 (cid:4) objective lens . Numbers of cells in nine randomly selected ﬁelds from triplicate chambers were counted in each experiment . To assess the effect of ectopic expression of RacCA , RacDN , Cdc42CA , or Cdc42DN , invasion assay was per - formed 48h after transfection . To assess the effect of WAVE - RNAi on Rac - induced invasion , cells were transfected with both 1 m g of pSUPER construct and 1 m g of pEF - BOS - Myc - RacCA in the second transfection . Invasion assay was performed 48 h after transfection . For invasion assays with Y27632 ( Tocris Cookson , Ellisville , MO , USA ) , cells were starved and assayed in DMEM - BSA containing 10 m M Y27632 . To assess the effect of ectopic co - expression of GFP - WAVE2 and RacCA , 0 . 8 m g of pEGFP - WAVE2 and 0 . 8 m g of pEF - BOS - Myc - RacCA were co - transfected into B16 cells and invasion assay was performed with 200 m l of 4 (cid:4) 10 5 cells / ml cell suspension . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy and time - lapse microscopic observation Immunoﬂuorescence confocal microscopy was performed as follows . After being replated , cells were cultured in DMEM / 10 % FCS on Matrigel ( # 35 - 6234 ; BD Biosciences ) - coated coverslips for 3h , ﬁxed in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min , and stained with primary antibodies followed by secondary antibodies ( Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti - rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti - rabbit IgG ) or rhodamine - phalloi - din ( Molecular Probes ) for F - actin visualization . Images were obtained with a Radiance 2000 System ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) . Time - lapse microscopic observations of Matrigel - overlaid cells were performed as described previously ( Connolly et al . , 2002 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were seeded in 35 - mm glass - bottomed dishes ( Matsunami Glass , Osaka , Japan ) and cultured in DMEM / 10 % FCS for 1 – 2h until they had adhered to the glass . The culture medium was then aspirated , and 50 m L Matrigel was overlaid and allowed to solidify at 37 1 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 for 1h . Culture medium ( 1 . 5 ml ) supplemented with 20 m M HEPES - KOH ( pH 7 . 5 ) was then added , and cells were observed over 8 h with an Axiovert S100 System ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) . For control observations without Matrigel , 50 m L of Matrigel was diluted with 1 . 5 ml DMEM / 10 % FCS and added to culture dishes . For confocal microscopic observation of EGFP - tagged WAVEs , a TCS SP2 System ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) was used . Image analysis was carried out with NIH image software . Experimental metastasis Experimental metastasis was performed as described pre - viously ( Giavazzi and Garofalo , 2001 ) with slight modiﬁca - tions . Brieﬂy , B16F10 cells were transfected twice with pSUPER vectors , and 48 h after transfection , cells were brieﬂy trypsinized and suspended in Hank’s balanced salt solution . WAVEs in invasion and metastasis S Kurisu et al 1317 Oncogene Cells ( 2 (cid:4) 10 5 ) were then injected intravenously into the tail veins of female C57BL / 6 mice ( Clea Japan , Tokyo , Japan ) . Mice 5 - to 7 week’s old were used for experiments . At 2 weeks after i . v . injection , mice were killed , the lungs were extirpated , and the black spherical B16F10 colonies were counted . In total , 10 mice were used for empty vector transfectants , nine for WAVE1 - RNAi vector transfectants , and 12 for WAVE2 - RNAi vector transfectants . Small GTPase activity assay GST - PAK - CRIB fusion protein was expressed as described ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) and immobilized on glutathione - sepharose beads ( Amersham Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) . Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50m M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 10m M MgCl 2 , 1 % NP - 40 , 10 % glycerol , 200m M NaCl , 1 m g / ml aprotinin , 1 m g / ml leupeptin , 1 m M DTT , and 1 m M PMSF . A measure of 5 – 10 m l of cell lysate was subjected to Western blotting for loading control . A total , 1 ml of cell lysate was mixed with 50 m l ( bed volume ) of GST - PAK - CRIB beads , and rotated at 4 1 C for 40 min . The beads were washed three times with cold wash buffer containing 25m M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 30 m M MgCl 2 , 40 m M NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 1m M DTT , 1 m g / ml aprotinin , 1 m g / ml leupeptin , and 1 m M PMSF and 20 m l of SDS sample buffer containing 50m M Tris - HCl ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 2 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , 6 % 2 - mercaptoethanol , 10 % glycerol , and 0 . 5mg / ml bromophenol blue was added . Samples were separated by electrophoresis , and Rac1 - GTP was detected by Western blotting . To assess Cdc42 activity , GST - N - WASP - CRIB fusion protein ( Miki et al . , 1998a ) was used in place of GST - PAK - CRIB . RBD of Rhotekin ( amino acids 7 – 89 ; Rhotekin - RBD ) was cloned into pGEX - 2 T vector ( Amersham Biosciences ) , and GST - fused Rhotekin - RBD was expressed and puriﬁed as described previously ( Segall et al . , 1996 ) . The RhoA - GTP pull - down assay was as described for Rac1 - GTP and Cdc42 - GTP except that cell lysis and washes were carried out with lysis buffer containing 50 m M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS , 500 m M NaCl , 10m M MgCl 2 , 1 m g / ml aprotinin , 1 m g / ml leupeptin , 1m M DTT , and 1m M PMSF , and wash buffer containing 50 m M Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 150 m M NaCl , 10m M MgCl 2 , 1 m g / ml aprotinin , 1 m g / ml leupeptin , 1 m M DTT , and 1m M PMSF . GST - Rhotekin - RBD was used in place of GST - PAK - CRIB . Statistics All densitometric analyses employed in this work were carried out by NIH image software . Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed by Student’s t - test from at least three independent experiments . To make the distinction between peripheral and aberrant membrane rufﬂes , we used the criteria as follows : cells with at least two rufﬂes on the dorsal side were counted aberrant ; cells that had a single dorsal rufﬂes at most in addition to peripheral rufﬂes were counted peripheral ; cells without membrane rufﬂing or cells that had isotropic rufﬂe structure were considered to be quiescent or spreading , and these cells were not counted as cells with polarized rufﬂes .
