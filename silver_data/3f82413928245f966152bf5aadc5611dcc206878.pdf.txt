Improving the photostability of bright monomeric orange and red ﬂuorescent proteins Nathan C Shaner 1 , 5 , Michael Z Lin 1 , 2 , Michael R McKeown 1 , 2 , Paul A Steinbach 1 , 2 , Kristin L Hazelwood 4 , Michael W Davidson 4 & Roger Y Tsien 1 – 3 All organic ﬂuorophores undergo irreversible photobleaching during prolonged illumination . Although ﬂuorescent proteins typically bleach at a substantially slower rate than many small - molecule dyes , in many cases the lack of sufﬁcient photostability remains an important limiting factor for experiments requiring large numbers of images of single cells . Screening methods focusing solely on brightness or wavelength are highly effective in optimizing both properties , but the absence of selective pressure for photostability in such screens leads to unpredictable photobleaching behavior in the resulting ﬂuorescent proteins . Here we describe an assay for screening libraries of ﬂuorescent proteins for enhanced photostability . With this assay , we developed highly photostable variants of mOrange ( a wavelength - shifted monomeric derivative of DsRed from Discosoma sp . ) and TagRFP ( a monomeric derivative of eqFP578 from Entacmaea quadricolor ) that maintain most of the beneﬁcial qualities of the original proteins and perform as reliably as Aequorea victoria GFP derivatives in fusion constructs . Substantial progress has recently been made in developing mono - meric or dimeric ﬂuorescent proteins covering the visual spec - trum 1 – 13 , but although brightness and wavelength have been primary concerns , photostability has generally been an after - thought ( with the notable exception of mTFP1 ; ref . 12 ) . Conse - quently , many new ﬂuorescent protein variants have relatively poor photostability . The ﬁrst - generation monomeric red ﬂuorescent protein , mRFP1 ( ref . 1 ) , although reasonably bright , was less photostable than its ancestor , Discosoma sp . DsRed 14 . In subsequent generations of mRFP1 variants ( the ‘mFruits’ ) , we observed seren - dipitous enhancement in photostability in some variants 2 , leading us to believe that it would be possible to apply directed evolution strategies to this property as well . To extend the utility of ﬂuorescent proteins , having optimized them for many other properties , we developed a screening method that additionally assays photostability in a medium - throughput format during directed evolution . Using a high - intensity light source , we photobleached entire 10 - cm plates of bacteria expressing the ﬂuorescent proteins of interest and selected those that main - tained the most brightness . This approach allowed us to screen libraries containing up to 100 , 000 clones reliably with no observed false - positive hits and to select simultaneously for the most photostable mutants that also maintained an acceptable level of ﬂuorescence emission at the desired wavelength , minimizing the tradeoff of desirable properties that frequently results from single - parameter screens . We applied our photostability screening assay to the directed evolution of variants derived from the bright red monomeric red ﬂuorescent protein TagRFP and the fast - bleaching monomeric orange ﬂuorescent protein mOrange . The resulting variants , TagRFP - Tand mOrange2 , were ninefold and 25 - fold more photostable than their respective ancestors , and both made excel - lent fusion partners when expressed in mammalian cells . RESULTSPhotostability assay and rationale To photobleach large numbers of bacterial colonies , we used a solar simulator , which produces a collimated beam approximately 10 cm in diameter with light intensities of 95 or 141 mW / cm 2 with 525 – 555 ( 540 / 30 ) or 548 – 588 ( 568 / 40 ) nm bandpass ﬁlters , respec - tively . This intensity , although approximately 100 - fold lower than that produced by unattenuated arc lamp illumination and 10 5 - fold lower than instantaneous intensities during confocal laser illumi - nation , was sufﬁcient to photobleach the photolabile ﬂuorescent protein mOrange to 50 % initial intensity after approximately 10 min . This reasonably short time allowed us to quickly screen bacterial libraries of up to 100 , 000 clones on plates . We minimized the heating of plates by placing them on a custom - built water - cooled aluminum block . At wavelengths necessary to photobleach orange and red ﬂuorescent proteins , we found no substantial decrease in bacterial viability after 2 h of illumination . Evolution of a brighter photostable red monomer To create a better red monomer , we initially undertook a rational design approach , drawing on analysis of mCherry’s enhanced photostability and mOrange’s higher quantum yield relative to mRFP1 . Six generations of directed evolution with constant photostability selection yielded the variant ‘mApple’ , which , though RECEIVED 21 NOVEMBER 2007 ; ACCEPTED 1 APRIL 2008 ; PUBLISHED ONLINE 4 MAY 2008 ; DOI : 10 . 1038 / NMETH . 1209 1 Department of Pharmacology , 2 Howard Hughes Medical Institute and 3 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , University of California at San Diego , 9500 Gilman Drive , La Jolla , California 92093 , USA . 4 National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and Department of Biological Science , The Florida State University , 1800 East Paul Dirac Drive , Tallahassee , Florida 32310 , USA . 5 Present address : The Salk Institute for Biological Studies , 10010 N .

This behavior was more pronounced with continuous wide - ﬁeld than with laser - scanning illumination and could be largely eliminated by excitation at alternate wavelengths or by intermittent illumination . However , given our later results using the brighter TagRFP as starting material , we chose not to pursue mApple any further . Although the recently developed orange - red monomer TagRFP 13 exhibits remarkable brightness , we have found that its photostabil - ity is still far from optimal . In both our standard arc - lamp photobleaching and laser - scanning confocal assays , we determined that TagRFP bleaches approximately threefold faster than mCherry ( Fig . 1a , b and Table 1 ) . Thus , we chose this protein as another starting point for improvement of photostability . We ﬁrst attempted rational design of a mutant library guided by the crystal structure of the closely - related protein eqFP611 ( ref . 15 ) . With the rationale that chromophore - interacting residues could inﬂuence photostability , we performed saturation mutagenesis of Ser158 and Leu199 , two residues proximal to the TagRFP chromophore . We then screened this library in bacteria with our solar simulator – based assay , using the 540 / 30 nm bandpass ﬁlter and exposure times of 120 min per plate , imaging the plates before and after bleaching to select those colonies that displayed high absolute brightness and a high ratio of post - bleach to pre - bleach ﬂuorescence emission . From this directed library , we identiﬁed one clone , TagRFP S158T ( designated TagRFP - T ) , which had a photobleaching half - time of 337 s by our standard assay , making it approximately ninefold more photostable than TagRFP ( Fig . 1a – c and Table 1 ) .

We expect that the beneﬁt of increased photostability should offset the small decrease in brightness and increase in acid sensitivity in most applications . Additionally , TagRFP - T matures to apparent completion and has virtually no emission in the green region of the spectrum ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , making it suitable for co - imaging with green ﬂuorescent proteins . We veriﬁed that TagRFP - Tremains monomeric by gel ﬁltration ( data not shown ) . Because the S158T mutation is in the interior of the folded protein , we anticipated that TagRFP - T would perform nearly identically to TagRFP when used as a fusion tag . Indeed , live - cell imaging conﬁrmed that TagRFP - T does not interfere with localization of any fusions tested ( Fig . 2 ) . Photobleaching of TagRFP and TagRFP - T under oxygen - free conditions revealed that TagRFP - T’s photobleaching remains oxygen - sensitive ( Fig . 1c and Table 1 ) . However , the oxygen - free bleaching half - time for TagRFP is similar to the ambient oxygen bleaching half - time for TagRFP - T . We next compared TagRFP and TagRFP - Tas fusions to histone H2B expressed in living cells under confocal illumination ( Fig . 1b and Table 1 ) . TagRFP - T had a photobleaching half - time approximately ninefold greater than that of TagRFP , consistent with the results obtained for puriﬁed proteins under continuous wide - ﬁeld illumination . Evolution of a photostable orange monomer We next attempted to engineer a photostable variant of mOrange , which is the brightest of the previously engineered mRFP1 variants but exhibits relatively fast bleaching . Because substitutions at position 163 improved photostability during the evolution of mCherry and mApple , we initially tested the M163Q mutant of mOrange , but found that improved photostability was accompa - nied by undesirable decreases in quantum yield and maturation efﬁciency . The M163K mutant of mOrange exhibited enhanced photostability and matured very efﬁciently , but suffered from increased acid sensitivity ( p K a of B 7 . 5 ) . Because another orange ﬂuorescent protein , mKO ( derived from Fungia concinna ) 6 , is both highly photostable 16 and possesses a methionine at the position equivalent to 163 , we reasoned that other pathways must exist for increasing photostability . To explore alternative photostability - enhancement evolution pathways , we used iterative random and directed mutagenesis and selection using the solar simulator . Initially we screened a randomly mutagenized library of mOrange by photobleaching with 540 / 30 nm light for 15 – 20 min per plate ( a time sufﬁcient to bleach mOrange to B 25 % of its initial brightness ) and selecting the brightest post - bleach clones by eye .

Saturation mutagenesis of residue 99—and residues 97 and 163 , which we imagined could have synergistic interactions with residue 99—did not yield additional improvements . We then constructed a randomly mutagenized library of mOr - ange F99Yand screened with a longer illumination time of 40 min per plate . This round of screening identiﬁed an additional muta - tion , Q64H , which conferred about a tenfold increase in photo - stability over the mOrange F99Y single mutant . Again , saturation mutagenesis of residues 64 and 99 along with neighboring residues 97 and 163 did not produce clones that were improved over the original clone identiﬁed in the random screen . Additionally , we found that the Q64H mutation alone did not confer substan - tially enhanced photostability but required the presence of the F99Y mutation ( data not shown ) . Two additional rounds of directed evolution with continued selection for photostability ( 540 / 30 nm ﬁlter , 40 min per plate ) improved the folding efﬁciency with mutations E160K and G196D , giving the ﬁnal clone , mOrange2 ( Table 2 ) . The highly desirable increase in photostability achieved in mOrange2 is balanced by a modest decrease in quantum yield ( 0 . 60 versus 0 . 69 ) and extinction coefﬁcient ( 58 , 000 versus 72 , 000 M – 1 cm – 1 ) , together corresponding to a 30 % decrease in brightness compared to mOrange . It also exhibits slightly shifted excitation and emission peaks ( 549 nm and 565 nm ) and an increased maturation half - time ( 4 . 5 h versus 2 . 5 h ; Table 1 ) . However , its photostability under arc - lamp illumination is over 25 - fold greater than that of mOrange ( Fig . 1d ) , making it nearly twice as photostable as mKO 6 , the previously most photostable known orange mono - mer 16 , approximately sixfold more photostable than TagRFP 13 and about 1 . 3 - fold more photostable than enhanced GFP ( EGFP ) 16 ( Fig . 1 and Table 2 ) . During laser - scanning confocal imaging , mOrange2 was approximately sixfold more photostable than mOrange and threefold more photostable than mKO ( Fig . 1b ) . Notably , the brightness and maturation time of mOr - ange2 are quite similar to those for mKO . mOrange2 remains acid - sensitive with a p K a of 6 . 5 , making it undesirable for targeting to acidic compartments , but attractive as a possible marker for exocytosis or other pH - variable processes 17 . Also , because it contains a small fraction of immature ( but nonﬂuorescent ) chro - mophore ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , mOrange2 may not be an ideal FRETacceptor . As with TagRFP - T , we veriﬁed that mOrange2 remained monomeric using gel ﬁltration ( data not shown ) . We then investigated the role of the key photostability - enhancing mutations present in mOrange2 , tested it in a wide range of fusion constructs , and compared its performance with that of mKO and tdTomato ( Fig . 3 and Supplementary Note 2 online ) . a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u Figure 3 | Wideﬁeld ﬂuorescence imaging of mOrange2 subcellular targeting fusions .

Nearly all had some degree of reversible photoswitching , which we observed as a recovery of up to 100 % of pre - bleach ﬂuorescence intensity when the ﬂuorescent protein was bleached to B 50 % of its initial intensity and then observed again after 1 – 2 min without illumination . In fact , several commonly used A . victoria GFP variants including EGFP , Cerulean and Venus , displayed reversible photoswitching 18 more severe than that observed for the variants we identiﬁed . A summary table of the results of these experiments along with representative traces for TagRFP , TagRFP - T , EGFP and Cerulean are available in Supple - mentary Note 3 online . These results suggest that our screen is not selecting speciﬁcally for photoswitching , which is no worse in the new proteins ( except for mApple ) than in well - established ﬂuorescent proteins . Although our observation of reversible photoswitching in such a broad range of ﬂuorescent proteins certainly raises concerns about the potential for previously undetected experimental artifacts , it is beyond the scope of this study to determine how common or severe this phenomenon may be . Of particular concern is the implication that ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments may be prone to artifacts that would confound data interpretation . We performed a limited evaluation of this possibility using histone H2B fusions to EGFP and EYFP expressed in mammalian cells and imaged on a laser - scanning confocal microscope . When we bleached these proteins to near completion with full laser power and then observed for recovery , we observed a negligible amount of reversible photoswitching ( data not shown ) . How - ever , an in - depth investigation is warranted to rule out such an effect in other ﬂuorescent proteins and under more varied experimental conditions . DISCUSSION Although the precise kinetics of photobleaching for a given ﬂuorescent protein are strongly dependent on illumination inten - sity and temporal regimen , we found that improvements in photostability at B 0 . 1 W / cm 2 usually qualitatively predict improved performance under typical conditions for wide - ﬁeld and laser scanning microscopy . The exceptions were mApple’s reversible photoswitching ( Supplementary Note 1 ) and tdToma - to’s poor performance under laser scanning confocal illumination ( Fig . 1b ) . Also , our screen used bacteria to express ﬂuorescent protein libraries , but all proteins produced from these studies behaved similarly when later tested in puriﬁed form or expressed in mammalian cells , consistent with our previous experience . Fluorescent proteins had been photobleached using an array of LEDs during the evolution of mTFP1 to select against unacceptable photolability or photoswitching , resulting in a protein with a bleaching half - time 110 s 12 . We applied photostability as a primary criterion to improve multiple ﬂuorescent proteins , and our results demonstrate that high photostability is a selectable phenotype . Moreover , a solar simulator takes advantage of the strong mercury lines at 546 , 577 and 579 nm and allows greater ﬂexibility in the choice of excitation wavelength than would be possible with LEDs . Although it is difﬁcult to draw strong conclusions about exact mechanisms of photobleaching from the mutations that confer photostability to mOrange2 , speciﬁc regions proximal to the chromophore appear to inﬂuence the modes of photobleaching the protein is able to undergo . DsRed , when illuminated by a 532 - nm pulsed laser , undergoes decarboxylation of Glu215 , as well as cis - to - trans isomerization of the chromophore 19 . Such chromo - phore isomerization has been implicated in the photoswitching behavior of Kindling ﬂuorescent protein ( KFP ) 20 , 21 and Dronpa 5 , 22 as well as predecessors to mTFP1 ( refs . 12 and 23 ) . Decarboxylation of the corresponding glutamate ( position 222 ) in A . victoria GFP also leads to changes in optical properties 24 – 26 . However , our observation that oxidation is important in mOrange , TagRFP and TagRFP - T photobleaching suggests that chromophore isomeriza - tion and Glu215 decarboxylation may have only a minor role for such proteins under normoxic conditions . Additionally , we found no evidence by mass spectrometry that photobleaching using the solar simulator led to any detectable decarboxylation of Glu215 in mOrange ( data not shown ) . Under some conditions mOrange2 shows an initial photoactivation of about 5 % ( Fig . 1a , d ) before bleaching takes over . At present we have no molecular explanation for this effect or the reversible photoswitching that is common to most ﬂuorescent proteins ( Supplementary Note 3 ) . For mRFP1 variants , we observed the importance of residue 163 in inﬂuencing photostability ( Supplementary Note 1 ) but also observed somewhat context - speciﬁc effects of residue 163 and surrounding residues on different wavelength - shifted variants . This region , composed of residues 64 , 97 , 99 and 163 , appears to be important in determining photostability . However , of these , only residue 163 is in direct contact with the chromophore . It may be that the mutations Q64H and F99Y together lead to a rearrange - ment of the other side chains in the vicinity of the chromophore so as to hinder a critical oxidation that leads to loss of ﬂuorescence . Discrepancies in tubulin and connexin localization ( Supplemen - tary Note 2 ) when fused to mOrange2 versus mKO or tdTomato can probably be attributed to the three - dimensional structure of the ﬂuorescent protein and potential steric hindrance in the fusions . mOrange2 contains extended N and C termini derived from EGFP to improve performance in fusions , whereas the much shorter protein , mKO ( 218 versus 236 amino acids ) , may experience steric interferences that lead to poorer performance in similar fusions . The fused dimeric character of tdTomato effectively doubles its size compared to the monomeric orange ﬂuorescent proteins , so steric hindrance is the most likely culprit in preventing tubulin localiza - tion . For most fusions , however , we observed little or no difference in performance between mOrange2 and mKO , suggesting that many proteins are more tolerant of fusion partners than tubulin or connexins . Though it already possessed reasonably good photostability , TagRFP was still amenable to improvements by our photostability selection method . From a saturation - mutagenesis library of two chromophore - proximal residues ( consisting of 400 independent clones ) , we selected a single clone with substantially enhanced photostability . The selected mutant , TagRFP - T , should prove to be a very useful addition to the ﬂuorescent protein arsenal , as it is the most photostable monomeric ﬂuorescent protein of any color yet described under both arc - lamp and confocal laser illumination . As the applications of genetically encoded ﬂuorescent markers continue to diversify and become more complex , the demand for greater photostability than is now available in ﬂuorescent proteins has likewise continued to grow .

Possible enhancements to this selection technique could include time - lapse imaging of bacterial plates during bleaching to enable direct selection for kinetics ( independent of absolute brightness ) and the use of higher - intensity illumi - nation from other light sources ( such as lasers ) during screening to select for or against nonlinear photobleaching behavior . Ideally , a selection scheme that allows true simu - lation of microscopic imaging light intensities while maintaining a medium - to - high throughput should allow selection of ﬂuorescent proteins with the most beneﬁcial properties for imaging applications . METHODS Mutagenesis . As the initial templates for library construction by random mutagenesis we used cDNA encoding mOrange 2 and TagRFP ( Evrogen ) 13 , both of which had been previously human codon – optimized . We performed error - prone PCR using the GeneMorph II kit ( Stratagene ) following the manufacturer’s pro - tocol , using primers containing Bam HI and Eco RI sites for mOrange variants or Bam HI and Bsr GI sites for TagRFP variants . We digested products of error - prone PCR products with appro - priate restriction enzymes and ligated the fragments into a modiﬁed pBAD vector ( Invitrogen ) or a constitutive bacterial expression vector pNCS , both of which encode an N - terminal 6His tag and linker identical to that found in pRSET B ( Invitro - gen ) . We performed site - directed mutagenesis using the Quik - Change II kit ( Stratagene ) following the manufacturer’s protocol or by overlap - extension PCR . Sequences for all primers used in this study are available in Supplementary Methods online . We transformed chemically competent or electrocompetent Escherichia coli strain LMG194 ( Invitrogen ) cells with libraries and grew them overnight at 37 1 C on LB - agar supplemented with 50 m g / ml ampicillin ( Sigma ) and 0 . 02 % ( wt / vol ) L - arabinose ( Fluka ) ( for pBAD - based libraries ) . Library screening . For each round of random mutagenesis , we screened 20 , 000 – 100 , 000 colonies ( 10 – 50 plates of bacteria ) , a number sufﬁcient to sample all possible single - site mutants and a limited number of double mutants . For each round of site - directed mutagenesis , we screened approximately threefold more colonies than the expected library diversity ( for example , 1 , 200 colonies for a 400 - member library ) to ensure full coverage . We photobleached whole plates of bacteria for 10 – 120 min ( determined empirically for each round of directed evolution ) on a Spectra - Physics 92191 – 1000 solar simulator with a 1 , 600 W mercury arc lamp equipped with two Spectra - Physics SP66239 - 3767 dichroic mir - rors to remove infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths . Remaining light was ﬁltered through 10 - cm square bandpass ﬁlters ( Chroma Technology Corp . ) appropriate to the ﬂuorescent protein being bleached ( 540 / 30 nm ( B540 / 30 ; 525 – 555 nm ) for mOrange - and TagRFP - based libraries or 568 / 40 nm ( B568 / 40 ; 548 – 588 nm ) for mApple libraries ) . We measured ﬁnal light intensities produced by the solar simulator by a miniature integrating - sphere detector ( SPD024 head and ILC1700 meter , International Light Corp . ) to be 95 mW / cm 2 for the 540 / 30 ﬁlter and 141 mW / cm 2 for the 568 / 40 ﬁlter . We maintained the temperature of the bacterial plates at 20 1 C during solar simulator bleaching using a home - built water - cooled aluminum block . For mOrange mutant selection , we examined the plates by eye as previously described 32 using a 150 W xenon lamp equipped with a 540 / 30 nm excitation ﬁlter and ﬁber optic light guides to illuminate the plates and 575 nm long pass ﬁlter to visualize emission . For TagRFP mutant selection , we imaged the plates before and after bleaching on an imaging system ( UVP ) using 535 / 45 nm ( 512 . 5 – 557 . 5 nm ) excitation and 605 / 70 nm ( 570 – 640 nm ) emission ﬁlters . In either case , we grew colonies that maintained bright ﬂuorescence after photobleaching and / or those with high post - to pre - bleach ﬂuorescence ratios for 8 h in 2 ml of LB medium supplemented with 100 m g / ml ampicillin and then increased the culture volume to 4 ml with additional LB supplemented with ampicillin and 0 . 2 % ( wt / vol ) L - arabinose to induce ﬂuorescent protein expression and grew the cultures overnight . We extracted protein from a fraction of each cell pellet with B - PER II ( Pierce ) and obtained spectra using a Saﬁre 96 - well plate reader with monochromators ( Tecan ) . When screening for photostable variants , we obtained spectra before and after photobleaching extracted protein on the solar simulator . We extracted plasmid DNA from the remaining cell pellet with a mini - prep kit ( Qiagen ) and used it for sequencing . Protein production and characterization . We expressed ﬂuores - cent proteins from pBAD vectors in E . coli strain LMG194 , puriﬁed them on Ni - NTA agarose ( Qiagen ) and characterized them as described 2 . Photobleaching measurements were per - formed on aqueous droplets of puriﬁed protein under oil as described 2 , 16 . To determine whether the presence of molecular oxygen inﬂuenced bleaching , we performed our standard bleach - ing experiment before and after equilibrating the entire bleaching apparatus under humidiﬁed N 2 .

Supplementary Note 1 Evolution of a brighter photostable red monomer . We began our attempts to create photostable mRFP1 - derived fluorescent proteins with an analysis of the most photostable existing variant , mCherry 1 . mCherry exhibits very similar excitation and emission spectra to mRFP1 , but has improved maturation efficiency and over 10 - fold greater photostability as judged by photon dose required for 50 % bleaching . By gathering photobleaching curves for intermediate mutants produced during mCherry directed evolution , we determined that the M163Q mutation present in mCherry was wholly responsible for its increased photostability ( data not shown ) . Residue 163 sits immediately adjacent to the chromophore phenolate , and is occupied by a lysine in wild - type DsRed that forms a salt bridge with the chromophore 2 . We first attempted to simultaneously evolve a brighter and more photostable red fluorescent monomer . The relatively photostable variant mCherry exhibits red fluorescence ( ex . 587 nm , em . 610 nm ) with a pKa of < 4 . 5 and a quantum yield of 0 . 22 . However , we observed that at very high pH this variant undergoes a transition to a higher - quantum yield ( ~ 0 . 50 ) blue - shifted ( ex . 568 nm , em . 592 nm ) form with a pKa of about 9 . 5 . Since a similar pH - dependence was observed in the early stages of the evolution of mOrange 1 , we reasoned that restoring threonine 66 in the chromophore of mOrange to the wild - type glutamine , as in DsRed , ( thus restoring red fluorescence ) might allow us to find a high - quantum yield red fluorescent variant with a pKa in a practical range . As predicted , the mOrange T66Q mutant exhibited red fluorescence similar to mCherry , but with a pKa for transition to high - quantum yield red fluorescence at a lower value than mCherry ( around 8 . 0 ) ( data not shown ) . One round of directed evolution led to the first low - pKa bright red mutant , mApple0 . 1 ( mOrange G40A , T66Q ) , which had a pKa of 6 . 4 . This mutant , however , exhibited rapid photobleaching ( data not shown ) and had a substantial fraction of “dead - end” green chromophore 3 which was brightly fluorescent . Subsequent rounds of directed evolution led to the introduction of the mutation M163K , which simultaneously increased photostability markedly and led to almost complete red chromophore maturation . With each round of directed evolution , we included both photostability screening ( with irradiation for 20 to 30 minutes per plate using a 568 / 40 nm bandpass filter ) and brightness screening , so this increase of photostability was maintained with each generation . After 6 rounds of directed evolution , our final variant , mApple , possesses 18 mutations relative to mOrange and 19 mutations relative to mCherry . With a quantum yield of 0 . 49 and extinction coefficient of 75 , 000 M - 1 ! cm - 1 , mApple is more than twice as bright as mCherry . Its reasonably fast maturation time of approximately 30 minutes should additionally allow rapid detection when expressed in cells ( see Supplementary Fig . 1 online and Tables 1 and 2 in the main text ) . When subjected to constant illumination , mApple displays unusual reversible photoswitching behavior . This photoswitching leads to a reduction in fluorescence emission of between 30 and 70 % after several seconds of illumination at typical fluorescence microscope intensities of 1 to 10 W / cm 2 ( for example , Fig . 1a in the main text , a photobleaching curve taken without neutral density filters ) . For the immediate precursor to mApple , mApple0 . 5 , this decrease in emission reverses fully within 30 seconds when illumination is discontinued , and cycles of photoswitching and full reversal appear to be repeatable over many cycles without substantial irreversible bleaching ( see Fig . A below ) . Figure A . Reversible photoswitching in mApple0 . 5 . 10 cycles of continuous arc lamp illumination with 10 % neutral density filter for four seconds ( solid lines , individual data points shown ) , with 30 seconds of darkness between cycles ( dotted lines ) ( normalized intensity versus actual exposure time ) . All data points are normalized to the initial image intensity ( at time 0 ) ; the progressive slight decreases in recovered intensity after each cycle are presumably due to small amounts of irreversible photobleaching or fatigue . mApple0 . 5 is the immediate precursor to mApple which lacks the external mutations R17H , K92R , S147E , T175A , and T202V . Because of its photoswitching behavior , mApple displays a short photobleaching t 1 / 2 of 4 . 8 seconds in our standard photobleaching assay ( see Table 1 in the main text ) . However , mApple appears far more photostable under laser scanning confocal illumination , with a photobleaching t 1 / 2 superior to mOrange and mKO , and approaching that of mCherry ( see Table 1 and Fig . 1b in the main text ) . The key difference between the two illumination conditions may be that laser scanning excitation is intermittent for any given pixel , giving time for some recovery in the dark . Also , unless extreme care is taken not to minimize excitation before taking the first image , it is easy to miss the very fast initial phase of decaying emission . All attempts to eliminate mApple’s photoswitching behavior by mutagenesis of residues surrounding the chromophore produced unwanted reductions in quantum yield and / or maturation efficiency . However , such photoswitching may make mApple useful for revolutionary new optical techniques for nanoscale spatial resolution ( “nanoscopy” , see below ) . All reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent proteins described thus far operate through cis - to - trans isomerization of the chromophore 4 , 5 , so this mechanism is probably responsible for the photoswitching of mApple . The fastest - switching mutant of Dronpa , M159T , relaxes in the dark from its temporarily dark state back to fluorescence with a half - time of 30 sec 6 ; mApple is almost completely recovered by 30 sec ( Fig . A , above ) , but its behavior is qualitatively similar to Dronpa M159T . Because mApple’s spontaneous recovery is already so fast , we have not yet systematically explored acceleration by short - wavelength illumination , but we have noticed that the initial fast decay of emission is absent with 480 nm excitation ( Fig . B , below ) , suggesting that this wavelength stimulates recovery from the dark state as well as the primary fluorescence . Figure B . mApple photobleaching at different excitation wavelengths . Widefield photobleaching curves for mApple purified protein under oil with excitation using 568 / 55 nm ( solid line ) , 540 / 25 nm ( dashed line ) , or 480 / 30 nm ( dotted line ) band pass filters , plotted as intensity versus normalized total exposure time with an initial emission rate of 1000 photons / s per molecule . Meanwhile , the existing properties of mApple would seem very attractive for photoactivated localization microscopy with independently running acquisition ( PALMIRA 7 ) . In this exciting new version of super - resolution microscopy , strong illumination ( several kW / cm 2 ) drives most of the fluorophores into a dark state . Individual fluorophores stochastically revert to the fluorescing state , briefly emit a burst of photons , then revert to the dark state . In any one image ( whose acquisition time should roughly match the mean duration of an emission burst ) , the emitters must be sparse enough so that they represent distinct single molecules whose position can be localized to a few nm by centroid - locating algorithms . Superposition of the centroid locations over many images produces a super - resolution composite image . Currently the only genetically encoded , photoreversible fluorophores are Dronpa , asFP595 , and their engineered variants . Dronpa fluoresces green and requires an excitation wavelength ( 488 nm ) that slightly stimulates photoactivation of the dark molecules as well as fluorescence and quenching of the bright molecules . asFP595 emits in the red but is very dim ( quantum yield < 0 . 001 ) and tetrameric , whereas mApple also emits red but is quite bright ( quantum yield 0 . 49 ) , very photostable apart from its fast photoswitching , and monomeric . Although Fig . B ( above ) shows photoswitching only down to ~ 30 % of initial intensity with a few W / cm 2 , PALMIRA operates with up to 3 orders of magnitude higher intensity , so that the activation density may be reducible to < 1 % . The photoswitching kinetics of the Dronpa mutant favored for PALMIRA , rsFastLime ( Dronpa - V157G ) 6 are somewhat different from those of mApple , but specific selection for variants with the desired kinetics or structure - guided design of mutants with altered photoswitching properties should be possible . While our laser scanning confocal bleach curves ( Fig . 1 in the main text ) suggest that mApple is quite photostable under high intensity intermittent illumination , it is yet to be determined if constant illumination at the higher intensities required for PALMIRA will lead to a larger degree of irreversible photobleaching . Thus , we believe that mApple or future variants have the potential to be genetically encoded red FPs complementary to green Dronpa for PALMIRA . References 1 . Shaner , N . C . et al .

Supplementary Note 2 Evolution of a photostable orange monomer . To determine whether the combination of Q64H and F99Y mutations could confer enhanced photostability on related fluorescent protein variants , we introduced these mutations into mRFP1 ( ref . 1 ) , the second - generation variant mCherry 2 , and mApple ( see main text ) . As with mOrange , the Q64H mutation alone did not lead to an increase in photostability of any of these variants ( data not shown ) . However , the combination of Q64H and F99Y conferred an ~ 11 - fold increase in photostability to mRFP1 , making it as photostable as its successor , mCherry ( data not shown ) . However , these mutations also had undesirable effects on maturation and folding efficiency of mRFP1 , making the double mutant suboptimal compared with mCherry . Interestingly , the combination of Q64H and F99Y had no effect on the photostability of mCherry or mApple , suggesting that this combination of mutations specifically enhances photostability in mRFP1 variants possessing methionine at position 163 . It is tempting to speculate that substitutions at 163 may inhibit photobleaching by the same mechanism as the Q64H + F99Y double mutation . To determine if photobleaching was occurring through an oxidative mechanism , we measured bleaching curves for mOrange and mOrange2 before and after removing O 2 by equilibration of the bleaching chamber under N 2 . Anoxia led to a dramatic increase in mOrange photobleaching half - time ( approximately 25 - fold , see Fig . 1a and Table 1 in the main text ) , indicating that the primary mechanism for mOrange photobleaching under normoxic conditions is oxidative . Interestingly , anoxia had almost no effect on the photobleaching curve of mOrange2 ( Fig . 1d in the main text ) , indicating that its primary bleaching mechanism is fundamentally different from that of mOrange and that the photostability - enhancing mutations almost completely suppress the oxidative bleaching pathway . However , anoxia did prevent the small amount of photoactivation observed for mOrange2 under normal conditions , indicating that this effect remains oxygen - dependent . To confirm the fusion tolerance and targeting functionality of mOrange2 in a wide range of host protein chimeras , we have developed a series of 20 mOrange2 fusion constructs to both the C - and N - terminus of the fluorescent protein . In all cases , the localization patterns of the fusion proteins was similar to those that we have simultaneously or previously confirmed with avGFP fusions ( mEGFP and mEmerald ; data not shown ) ( see Fig . 2 in the main text ) . Fusions of mOrange2 to histone H2B were observed not to hinder successful cell division as all phases of mitosis were present in cultures expressing this construct ( Fig . 2q - u in the main text ) . mOrange2 also performed well as a fusion to the microtubule ( + ) - end binding protein , EB3 ( Fig . 2e in the main text ) where it could be observed tracing the path of growing microtubules in time - lapse image sequences . Thus , mOrange2 is expected to perform as well as highly validated fluorescent proteins such as mEGFP in fusion constructs . In order to compare the targeting capabilities of mOrange2 to other fluorescent proteins in the orange spectral class , we constructed fusions of mKusabira Orange ( mKO ) and tdTomato to human a - tubulin and rat a - 1 connexin - 43 and imaged them in HeLa cells along with identical fusions to mOrange2 ( Fig . C below ) . Because they are tightly packed in ordered tubulin filaments , fluorescent protein fusions to a - tubulin often do not localize properly if any degree of oligomeric character is present in the fluorescent protein or if the construct experiences steric hindrance due to the size and / or folding behavior of the fluorescent protein . Similarly , connexin - 43 fusions are also sensitive to fluorescent protein structural parameters in localization experiments . Figure C . Comparison of mOrange2 , mKO , and tdTomato fusions in microtubules and gap junctions . ( a – c ) Widefield fluorescence images of HeLa cells expressing an identical human a - tubulin ( C - terminus ; 6 - amino acid linker ) localization construct fused to : ( a ) mOrange2 ; ( b ) mKO ; ( c ) tdTomato . 100x magnification ; Bar = 10 mm . ( d – f ) HeLa cells expressing an identical rat a - 1 connexin - 43 ( N - terminus ; 7 - amino acid linker ) localization construct fused to ( d ) mOrange2 ; ( e ) mKO ; ( f ) tdTomato . 60x magnification ; Bar = 10 mm . Fusions of mOrange2 to a - tubulin localize as expected to produce discernable microtubule filaments ( Fig . Ca above ) , but the same construct substituting mKO for mOrange2 exhibits punctate behavior that obscures the identification of any tendency to form filaments ( Fig . Cb above ) . The tdTomato - a - tubulin fusion shows no evidence of localization and produces patterns reminiscent of whole - cell expression by the fluorescent protein without a fusion partner ( note the dark outlines of mitochondria in the cytoplasm : Fig . Cc above ) . Fusions of mOrange2 with rat a - 1 connexin - 43 are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum and traffic through the Golgi complex before being translocated to the plasma membrane and properly assembled into functional gap junctions ( Fig . Cd above ) . In contrast , mKO fusions with connexin - 43 produce extraordinarily large cytoplasmic vesicles and form less clearly defined and much smaller gap junctions ( Fig . Ce above ) . tdTomato - connexin - 43 fusions form aggregates in the cytoplasm accompanied by widespread labeling of the membrane with no apparent trafficking patterns through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex . In addition , the fusion does not form morphologically distinct gap junctions , but occasionally will produce regions of brighter fluorescence where plasma membranes of neighboring cells overlap ( Fig . Cf above ) . In all other fusions tested , mKO performed as well as mOrange2 ( data not shown ) , suggesting that most proteins will tolerate fusion to either protein . References 1 . Campbell , R .

Supplementary Note 3 Reversible photoswitching assays . Our observation that our newly engineered photostable fluorescent protein variants exhibited varying degrees of reversible photoswitching led us to explore this phenomenon in other commonly used fluorescent proteins . To qualitatively measure this behavior , histone H2B fusions to each fluorescent protein were expressed and imaged in HeLa - S3 cells by widefield and laser scanning confocal microscopy ( LSCM ) ( for instrumentation , see Live cell imaging and LSCM live cell photobleaching in Supplementary Methods ) . For both widefield and LSCM imaging , cells were exposed to constant illumination without neutral density filters ( widefield ) or with 25 - 100 % laser power ( LSCM ) ( corresponding to excitation intensities between 32 and 151 W / cm 2 for widefield and between 49 and 637 W / cm 2 ( scan - averaged ) for LSCM ) until they had dimmed to between 75 % and 50 % initial fluorescence intensity . The cells were then allowed to recover in darkness for 1 to 2 minutes , after which time they were re - imaged . Any recovery of fluorescence could not be due to diffusion from non - illuminated regions , because the histone H2B fusions were confined within nuclei that were entirely within the bleached area . The percent recovery ( % REC ) of the peak initial fluorescence was calculated as : ! % REC = f r " f bl f 0 " f bl where f 0 is the peak initial fluorescence , f bl is the post - bleach fluorescence , and f r is the post - dark recovery fluorescence . See Fig . D below for an example of the behavior of EGFP under widefield and confocal illumination . Results for a wide variety of FPs are reported in Table A below . While these data strongly suggest that reversible photoswitching is a common feature among fluorescent proteins , these data are not intended to be quantitative ; further in - depth investigation of this phenomenon under a wider variety of experimental conditions will be necessary to fully characterize this effect and its possible implications in any given experiment . Figure D . Example of reversible photoswitching curves for mEGFP . For both ( a ) widefield and ( b ) confocal imaging , cells expressing histone H2B fused to mEGFP were exposed to constant illumination until measurably bleached , then the cells were then allowed to recover in darkness for approximately 1 minute ( indicated by the grey bars ) , after which time they were re - imaged . The initial fluorescence value f 0 , post - bleach fluorescence f b , and post - recovery fluorescence f r are indicated by the arrows . In this experiment , mEGFP exhibits 45 % recovery during widefield imaging and 24 % recovery during laser scanning confocal imaging . Note that photobleaching times have not been normalized for differences in excitation intensity . Table A . Summary of reversible photoswitching data .

Excitation intensity , as measured at the objective , is shown in parentheses ( scan - averaged for LSCM ) . c ND = not determined To more precisely characterize the degree of reversible photoswitching in three representative proteins ( TagRFP , TagRFP - T , and Cerulean ) , aqueous droplets of purified protein under oil were bleached on a microscope at ambient temperatures with xenon arc lamp illumination through a 540 / 25 filter ( for TagRFP and TagRFP - T ) or 420 / 20 nm filter ( for Cerulean ) without neutral density filters for short ( ~ 2 to 10s ) or long ( ~ 2 to 10 min ) intervals , and allowed to recover in the dark while fluorescence intensity was measured with 50ms exposures ( Fig . E below ) . All three proteins were able to recover to nearly 100 % after very short periods of bleaching , and to a lesser degree after longer periods . Once again , these data strongly indicate the need for further investigation of this phenomenon in all commonly used fluorescent proteins . Figure E . Reversible photoswitching of TagRFP , TagRFP - T , and Cerulean during widefield microscopy . ( a ) A fraction of TagRFP fluorescence recovers after both short and sustained photobleaching . Purified TagRFP was bleached on a microscope at ambient temperatures with xenon arc lamp illumination through a 540 / 25 nm filter for short ( ~ 2s ) or long intervals as indicated by the bars , and allowed to recover in the dark while fluorescence intensity was measured with 50ms exposures . ( b ) A fraction of TagRFP - T fluorescence recovers after short photobleaching , but not after sustained photobleaching . ( c ) Cerulean demonstrates fluorescence recovery after short ( ~ 10s ) and sustained photobleaching through a 420 / 20 nm filter . Exposure intervals are indicated by bars . Note that photobleaching times are raw , and have not been adjusted for different illumination powers and the different extinction coefficients and quantum yields as is done to derive normalized photostability measurements .

Parallel samples of purified mOrange were prepared without bleaching and with 60 minutes bleaching on the solar simulator , and dialyzed into 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8 . 5 . Samples were then digested with LysC ( Wako Biochemicals ) which cuts at the C - terminal side of lysine , or AspN ( Roche Diagnostics ) which cuts at the N - terminal side of aspartic acid . For the LysC digests , protein was denatured in 6 M guanidinium HCl with incubation in a 72 ° C water bath for 2 minutes , followed by addition of LysC enzyme at a 30 : 1 protein to enzyme ratio , and incubation for 18 hours at 36 ° C . For the AspN digests , protein was denatured in 8 M urea with incubation in a 90 ° C water bath for 2 minutes , followed by addition of AspN enzyme at a 50 : 1 protein to enzyme ratio , an incubation for 18 hours at 36 ° C . Digested peptides were desalted with a C18 ZipTip ( Millipore ) to prepare the sample for matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization ( MALDI ) mass spectrometry . The MALDI matrix used was ! - cyanohydroxycinnamic acid ( Fluka ) . Mass spectra were collected on an Voyager - DE STR MALDI - TOF ( Applied Biosystems ) using default tuning parameters . Mammalian expression vectors . All mOrange2 and TagRFP - T expression vectors were constructed using C1 and N1 ( Clontech - style ) cloning vectors . The fluorescent protein was amplified with a 5’ primer encoding an AgeI site and a 3’ primer encoding either a BspEI ( C1 ) or NotI ( N1 ) site ( see Primer list , above ) . The purified and digested PCR products were ligated into similarly digested pEGFP - C1 and pEGFP - N1 ( Clontech ) cloning vector backbones . To generate fusion vectors , the appropriate cloning vector and an EGFP fusion vector were digested , either sequentially or doubly , with the appropriate enzymes and ligated together after gel purification . Thus , to prepare N - terminal fusions , the following digests were performed : human non - muscle ! - actinin , Eco RI and Not I ( vector source , Tom Keller , FSU ) ; human cytochrome C oxidase subunit VIII , Bam HI and Not I ( mitochondria , Clontech ) ; rat ! - 1 connexin - 43 and " - 2 connexin - 26 , Eco RI and Bam HI ( Matthias Falk , Lehigh University ) ; human histone H2B , Bam HI and Not I ( George Patterson , NIH ) ; N - terminal 81 amino acids of human " - 1 , 4 - galactosyltransferase , Bam HI and Not I ( Golgi , Clontech ) ; human microtubule - associated protein EB3 , Bam HI and Not I ( Lynne Cassimeris , Lehigh University ) ; human vimentin , Bam HI and Not I ( Robert Goldman , Northwestern University ) ; human keratin 18 , Eco RI and Not I ( Open Biosystems ) ; chicken paxillin , Eco RI and Not I ( Alan Horwitz , University of Virginia ) ; rat lysosomal membrane glycoprotein 1 , Age I and Nhe I ( George Patterson , NIH ) . To prepare C - terminal fusions , the following digests were performed : human " - actin , Nhe I and Bgl II ( Clontech ) ; human ! - tubulin , Nhe I and Bgl II ( Clontech ) ; human light chain clathrin , Nhe I and Bgl II ( George Patterson , NIH ) ; human lamin B1 , Nhe I and Bgl II ( George Patterson , NIH ) ; human fibrillarin , Age I and Bgl II ( Evrogen ) ; human vinculin , Nhe I and Eco RI ( Open Biosystems ) ; peroximal targeting signal 1 ( PTS1 - peroxisomes ) , Age I and Bsp EI ( Clontech ) ; human RhoB GTPase with an N - terminal c - Myc epitope tag ( endosomes ) , Age I and Bsp EI ( Clontech ) . DNA for mammalian transfection was prepared using the Plasmid Maxi kit ( Qiagen ) . Live cell imaging . HeLa epithelial ( CCL - 2 , ATCC ) and Grey fox lung fibroblast ( CCL - 168 , ATCC ) cells were grown in a 50 : 50 mixture of DMEM and Ham’s F12 with 12 . 5 % Cosmic calf serum ( HyClone ) and transfected with Effectene ( Qiagen ) . Imaging was performed in Delta - T culture chambers ( Bioptechs ) under a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 in air . Fluorescence images in widefield mode were gathered using a TE - 2000 inverted microscope ( Nikon ) equipped with QuantaMax TM filters ( Omega ) and a Cascade II camera ( Photometrics ) or an IX71 microscope ( Olympus ) equipped with BrightLine TM filters ( Semrock ) and a ImagEM TM camera ( Hamamatsu ) . Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed on C1Si ( Nikon ) and FV1000 ( Olympus ) , both equipped with helium - neon and diode lasers and proprietary filter sets to match fluorophore emission spectral profiles . Spinning disk confocal microscopy was performed on a DSU - IX81 microscope ( Olympus ) equipped with a Lumen 200 illuminator ( Prior ) , Semrock filters , 10 - position filter wheels driven by a Lambda 10 - 3 controller ( Sutter ) , and a 9100 - 12 EMCCD camera ( Hamamatsu ) . Cell cultures expressing fluorescent protein fusions were fixed after imaging in 2 % paraformaldehyde ( EMS ) and washed several times in PBS containing 0 . 05 M glycine before mounting with a polyvinyl alcohol - based medium . Morphological features in all fusion constructs were confirmed by imaging fixed cell preparations on coverslips using an 80i upright microscope ( Nikon ) and ET - DsRed filter set ( # 4900 ; Chroma ) coupled to an Orca ER ( Hamamatsu ) or a CoolSNAP TM HQ 2 ( Photometrics ) camera . Laser scanning confocal microscopy live cell photobleaching . Laser scanning confocal microscopy ( LSCM ) photobleaching experiments were conducted with N - terminal fusions of the appropriate fluorescent protein to human histone H2B ( 6 - residue linker ) to confine fluorescence to the nucleus in order to closely approximate the dimensions of aqueous droplets of purified FPs used in widefield measurements . HeLa - S3 cells ( average nucleus diameter = 17 µ m ) were transfected with the H2B construct using Effectene ( Qiagen ) and maintained in a 5 % CO 2 in Delta - T imaging chambers ( Bioptechs ) for at least 36 hours prior to imaging . The chambers were transferred to a stage adapter ( Bioptechs ) , imaged at low magnification to ensure cell viability , and then photobleaching using a 40x oil immersion objective ( Olympus UPlan Apo , NA = 1 . 00 ) . Laser lines ( 543 nm , He - Ne and 488 nm , argon - ion ) were adjusted to an output power of 50 µ W , measured with a FieldMaxII - TO ( Coherent ) power meter equipped with a high - sensitivity silicon / germanium optical sensor ( OP - 2Vis , Coherent ) . The instrument ( FV300 , Olympus ) was set to a zoom of 4X , a region of interest of 341 . 2 µ m 2 ( 108 x 108 pixels ) , a photomultiplier voltage of 650 V , and an offset of 9 % with a scan time of 0 . 181 seconds per frame . Nuclei having approximately the same dimensions and intensity under the fixed instrument settings were chosen for photobleaching assays . Fluorescence using the 543 laser was recorded with a 570 nm dichromatic mirror and 656 nm longpass barrier filter , whereas emission using the 488 laser was directly reflected by a mirror through a 510 nm longpass barrier filter . The photobleaching half - times for LSCM imaging were calculated as the time required to reduce the scan - averaged emission rate to 50 % from an initial emission rate of 1000 photons / s per fluorescent protein chromophore . Briefly , the average photon flux ( photons / ( s x m 2 ) ) over the scanned area of interest was calculated thus : ! " = P EA = P # hcA where P is the output power of the laser measured at the objective in Joules / sec , A is the scanned area in m 2 , and ! E = hc " is the energy of a photon in Joules at the laser wavelength ( either 543 nm or 488 nm ) . The optical cross section ( in cm 2 ) of a fluorescent protein chromophore is given by : ! " ( # ) = ( 1000cm 3 / L ) ( ln10 ) $ ( # ) 6 . 023 % 10 23 / mole where ! " ( # ) is the extinction coefficient of the fluorescent protein at the laser wavelength in M - 1 x cm - 1 . And so the scan - average excitation rate per fluorescent molecule is given by : ! X = " # ( $ ) and so the time to bleach from an initial scan - averaged rate of 1000 photons / s to 500 photons / s is : ! t 1 / 2 = t raw XQ 1000photons / s where t raw is the measured photobleaching half - time and Q is the fluorescent protein quantum yield . To produce full bleaching curves , we simply scale the raw time coordinates by the factor ! XQ 1000photons / s and normalize the intensity coordinate to 1000 photons / s initial emission rate .
