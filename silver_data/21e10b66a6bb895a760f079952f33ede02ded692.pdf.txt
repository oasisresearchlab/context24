Beijing Key Laboratory of Indoor Air Quality Evaluation and Control , Tsinghua University , Beijing 100084 , China Abstract A growing number of cases have proved the possibility of airborne transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) . Ensuring an adequate ventilation rate is essential to reduce the risk of infection in confined spaces . In this study , we estimated the association between the infection probability and ventilation rates with the Wells – Riley equation , where the quantum generation rate ( q ) by a COVID - 19 infector was obtained using a reproductive number - based fitting approach . The estimated q value of COVID - 19 is 14 – 48 h −1 . To ensure an infection probability of less than 1 % , a ventilation rate larger than common values ( 100 – 350 m 3 / h per infector and 1200 – 4000 m 3 / h per infector for 0 . 25 h and 3 h of exposure , respectively ) is required . If the infector and susceptible person wear masks , then the ventilation rate ensuring a less than 1 % infection probability can be reduced to a quarter respectively , which is easier to achieve by the normal ventilation mode applied in typical scenarios , including offices , classrooms , buses , and aircraft cabins . Strict preventive measures ( e . g . , wearing masks and preventing asymptomatic infectors from entering public spaces using tests ) that have been widely adopted should be effective in reducing the risk of infection in confined spaces .

Although the transmission of COVID - 19 occurs mainly via droplets during close contact or via contaminated surfaces , a recent study showed that SARS - CoV - 2 remains viable in aerosols for multiple hours ( Van Doremalen et al . 2020 ) . A recent report suggested that current research supports the possibility that SARS - CoV - 2 can be spread via bioaerosols generated directly by patients’ exhalation ( National Research Council 2020 ) . Furthermore , recent visualization studies also support that SARS - CoV - 2 may spread between the infector and susceptible person simply by speaking ( Anfinrud et al . 2020 ; Stadnytskyi et al . 2020 ) . A recent field sampling study further indicated that SARS - CoV - 2 is widely distributed in the air , and the transmission distance in the air might be up to 4 m ( Guo et al . 2020 ) . These results partly explain the easier spread of SARS - CoV - 2 in confined spaces . The Wells – Riley equation is a classic model for quantifying the risk associated with airborne transmission of respiratory diseases ( Riley et al . 1978 ) . It has been used to demonstrate that some building factors ( particularly the ventilation rate ) are important removal mechanisms for airborne infectious agents ( Escombe et al . 2007 ) . In addition , a report by WHO suggested that insufficient ventilation increases disease transmission ( Chartier et al . 2009 ) . Therefore , ensuring a sufficient ventilation rate for offices , classrooms , and public transport is essential to reduce the potential risk of infection in these confined spaces , which is extremely important for daily life . In this study , we employed the Wells – Riley equation to estimate the association between the infection probability and ventilation rate , where the quantum generation rate ( q ) is a critical parameter . The value of q of a COVID - 19 infector is currently not well established , and we obtained this value based on its fitted correlation with the basic reproductive number ( R 0 ) . We then estimated the association between B UILD S IMUL ( 2020 ) 13 : 1321 – 1327 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s12273 - 020 - 0703 - 5 Dai and Zhao / Building Simulation / Vol . 13 , No . 6 1322 the infection probability and ventilation rate for some typical scenarios , including offices , classrooms , buses , and aircraft cabins . 2 Methods 2 . 1 Wells – Riley equation The Wells – Riley equation is as follows ( Riley et al . 1978 ) : = 1 e Iqpt Q C P S - = - ( 1 ) where P is the probability of infection risk ; C is the number of cases that develop infection ; S is the number of susceptible people . I is the number of source patients ( infectors ) ; in this study , we focused on normal scenarios ( not health care settings for COVID - 19 patients ) , thus , we assumed I = 1 . p is the pulmonary ventilation rate of each susceptible person per hour ( m 3 / h ) ; p = 0 . 3 m 3 / h when people are sitting or participating in light activity indoors ( Duan et al . 2013 ) . Q is the room ventilation rate ( m 3 / h ) ; q is the quantum generation rate produced by one infector ( h −1 ) ; t is the exposure time ( h ) . The unit “quantum” in this risk model is not an actual physical unit ; it is a hypothetical infectious dose unit that is typically back - calculated from epidemiological studies . One quantum is defined as a collection of pathogen particles that can infect susceptible people ( Riley et al . 1978 ) . The Wells – Riley equation has two key assumptions , as follows : ( 1 ) droplet nuclei are evenly distributed in space , which means that the infection risk predicted by this equation is uniform within the space and ( 2 ) the equation neglects the viability and infectivity of the pathogen quanta . Owing to the filtration effect of the mask , we considered that wearing a mask of infector can dilute exhaled pathogen concentration ; while for the susceptible person , it’s equivalent to increasing the room ventilation rate . The filtration efficiency of ordinary medical surgical masks on virus - laden aerosols is about 60 % ( Hui et al . 2012 ) , which can be set as 50 % considering the influence of air leakage ( Davies et al . 2013 ) . The modified Wells – Riley equation is as follows : I s ( 1 ) ( 1 ) 1 e Iqpt η η Q C P S - - - = = - ( 2 ) where η I is the exhalation filtration efficiency , η I = 50 % ; η s is the respiration filtration efficiency , η s = 50 % . Furthermore , a previous study modified the Wells – Riley equation to include deposition rates ( k deposition ) and filtration removal rates ( k filtration ) ( Stephens 2012 ) . The k deposition depends primarily on the particle size , density , and room characteristics , such as air speeds and surface areas ( Fennelly and Nardell 1998 ; Fisk et al . 2004 ) . It’s measured ( Liu et al . 2020b ) that viral RNA in aerosols and found that SARS - CoV - 2 aerosol mainly resides in two size ranges , namely 0 . 25 – 0 . 50 μm and 0 . 50 – 1 . 00 μm . It’s indicated that the range of k deposition is 0 . 21 – 0 . 63 h −1 with a mean value of 0 . 36 h – 1 for aerosols in such two size ranges ( Ji and Zhao 2015 ) . This k deposition value has a negligible effect compared with the removal effect of ventilation in this study . Regarding the k filtration value , if we treat the ventilation rate ( Q ) as the equivalent clean air delivery rate ( CADR ) , which is equal to the actual ventilation rate multiplied by filtration efficiency ( Foarde 1999 ) , then no modification is required to incorporate it . Finally , the key input parameter when applying the Wells – Riley equation is q . 2 . 2 Quantum generation rate with a reproductive number - based fitting approach So far , there have been no available reported values of q of SARS - CoV - 2 . To obtain a reasonable q value , we collected the known q value and R 0 for other airborne transmitted infectious diseases in previous studies , and fitted the association between them . R 0 is the key epidemiological determinant that characterizes the transmission potential of an infectious disease , which is defined as the average number of infectious individuals created by a single infector in a susceptible population ( Anderson et al . 1992 ) . As both the q and R 0 essentially determine the rate of spread of an epidemic and are estimated based on actual confirmed cases , we think that it may be logical to obtain the q value based on its association with R 0 as a compromised but relatively reasonable approach . We then estimated q with the R 0 of COVID - 19 based on the fitted equation . Table 1 lists the values of q and R 0 for several typical infectious diseases collected from the references . It’s reported that the transmission of respiratory pathogens such as measles , tuberculosis , middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS ) , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) and influenza in indoor environments are governed by similar physical and biological Table 1 Quantum generation rate ( q ) and basic reproductive number ( R 0 ) values of airborne transmitted infectious diseases q ( h −1 ) R 0 Reference Tuberculosis 1 – 50 2 . 22 – 5 . 46 Stephens 2012 ; Li et al . 2018 MERS 6 – 140 0 . 50 – 1 . 20 WHO 2019 SARS 10 – 300 2 . 00 – 5 . 00 WHO 2003 Influenza 15 – 500 1 . 60 – 3 . 00 Lee et al . 2012 Measles 570 – 5600 11 . 00 – 18 . 00 Plans Rubió 2012 Dai and Zhao / Building Simulation / Vol . 13 , No . 6 1323 processes to COVID - 19 ( Stephens 2012 ; WHO 2003 , 2019 ) . With the values listed in this table as inputs , we fitted the association between q and R 0 with a least square method implemented in Origin 2019 . 3 Results 3 . 1 Fitted quantum generation rate of COVID - 19 with the basic reproductive number The fitted curve representing the association between q and R 0 is shown in Figure 1 , and the fitted equation is as follows : 2 1 0 2 0 q A B R B R = + ´ + ´ ( 3 ) where A = −30 . 27958 ± 26 . 07 , B 1 = −44 . 81536 ± 12 . 34048 , and B 2 = 19 . 67934 ± 0 . 62317 . With the widely used range of R 0 of 2 . 0 – 2 . 5 ( Imai et al . 2020 ; Li et al . 2020 ; Majumder and Mandl 2020 ; Read et al . 2020 ; Zhao et al . 2020b ) , we obtained the corresponding range of q for COVID - 19 , which was 14 – 48 h −1 . Considering that the R 0 of measles is much larger than that of other infectious diseases , we fitted the association between q and R 0 with the same method but removed the R 0 of measles ( Figure 2 ) . The corresponding range of q for COVID - 19 is 2 – 40 h −1 , which is comparable to the results obtained from Figure 1 and Eq . ( 3 ) . During the preparation of this manuscript , we found a study conducted by Lu et al . ( 2020 ) reporting a suspected case of airborne transmission of COVID - 19 in Guangzhou , China , which is a suitable epidemiological case for the back - calculation of q . According to the description presented in the article , we back - calculated the value of q to be 22 h −1 . Furthermore , we also noticed another novel method for predicting the value of q on the basis of the emitted viral load from the mouth ( Buonanno et al . 2020 ) . The results show that q varies significantly as a function of different parameters Fig . 1 The fitted curve between the quantum generation rate ( q ) and basic reproductive number ( R 0 ) ( with measles values ) Fig . 2 The fitted curve between the quantum generation rate ( q ) and basic reproductive number ( R 0 ) ( without measles values ) ( including inhalation rate , type of respiratory activity , and activity level ) . Our aim is to analyze the asymptomatic case in light exercise activity , which represents the typical characteristic of infectors in common public spaces . Considering this point , the corresponding q reported by Buonanno et al . ( 2020 ) is between 10 . 5 and 33 . 9 h −1 . Such values are in the same magnitude as the results in this study . Based on the above analysis , it can be considered that the initially estimated value of q in this study is reliable . Thus , we applied a q value of 14 – 48 h −1 for the sedentary state for later analysis . 3 . 2 Association between infection probability and ventilation rate 3 . 2 . 1 Infection probability Figure 3 shows the estimated association between the infection probability and ventilation rate . For the case with one infector inside of a confined space , a ventilation rate of 100 – 350 m 3 / h per infector was required to ensure an infection probability of less than 1 % for 0 . 25 h of exposure of a susceptible person . A ventilation rate of 1200 – 4000 m 3 / h per infector was required to ensure an infection probability of less than 1 % for 3 h of exposure of a susceptible person . 3 . 2 . 2 Effect of wearing a mask The estimated association between the infection probability and ventilation rate for the cases with masks is shown in Figure 4 . The results indicated that wearing a mask plays an important role in reducing the infection risk . For the case where there was one infector inside of a confined space , if both the infector and susceptible person wore masks , then the required ventilation rate to ensure an infection probability of less than 1 % was reduced to 30 – 90 m 3 / h per infector for 0 . 25 h of exposure and 300 – 1000 m 3 / h per infector for 3 h of exposure of a susceptible person , respectively .

Table 2 lists the corresponding air change rates ( ACHs ) for typical volumes of the examined confined spaces . The ACH is a measurement of how much fresh / clean air replaces indoor air in 1 h ( Sherman and Wilson 1986 ) , which is more widely used in engineering to determine if ventilation and air conditioning systems can provide a sufficient ventilation rate to ensure a low infection probability . If people are wearing masks , then natural ventilation or normal mechanical ventilation can provide a sufficient ventilation rate to ensure that the infection probability is less than 1 % for most scenarios ( except for offices ; Table 2 ) . However , not wearing masks may result in a relatively higher infection risk for most cases , especially if q reaches the maximum value . In these scenarios , additional measures could be suggested if the actual ventilation rate is out of a safe range , including UV sterilization , HEPA filtration and increasing outdoor air rate ( Zhao et al . 2020a ) .

Several methods have been produced , resulting in different estimations of R 0 . For example , there are studies showing that the R 0 of COVID - 19 can be reached a high level of 6 . 47 ( Tang et al . 2020 ) . However , R 0 seems to be stabilized at around 2 – 3 , which is obtained from a large database ( Liu et al . 2020a ) and from more different researches ( D’Arienzo and Coniglio 2020 ; Imai et al . 2020 ; Li et al . 2020 ; Majumder and Mandl 2020 ; Read et al . 2020 ; Riou and Althaus 2020 ; Zhao et al . 2020b ) , the data used includes both the Mainland of China and overseas outbreak up to March , 2020 . Thus the R 0 of 2 – 2 . 5 here can be expected to be reliable , as it builds upon more case data . Given the large uncertainties associated with each of the parameters , we relied on two assumptions in an attempt to link the indoor ventilation strategy to infectious disease risk models , namely , the ventilation efficiency was assumed to be 1 and the concentration of viruses was assumed to be homogeneous in the indoor environment . The estimation indicates that when an infector remains in a public confined space , the infection risk is relatively high with an infection probability of approximately 2 % at the common ventilation rate ( 500 – 2500 m 3 / h per infector for 0 . 25 h of exposure ; Figure 3 ) . Such findings may partly explain the early large - scale epidemics in China and European and American countries . Thus , preventing the infectors ( especially asymptomatic infectors that have not been confirmed ) from entering these types of public spaces is critical to suppress the spread of the virus via airborne transmission . Current measures , strict screening of asymptomatic infectors with wider nucleic acid tests , and home isolation have already ensured that infectors are unlikely to enter public spaces and have ensured a relatively safe environment in confined spaces . Furthermore , the above findings imply that wearing an ordinary medical surgical mask is effective ; thus , it is important to advise people to wear masks when they enter or remain in confined spaces . It is acknowledged that COVID - 19 is transmitted mainly by close contact or droplets deposited on contaminated surfaces . However , the risk of potential or opportunistic airborne transmission cannot be ignored , especially in public confined spaces . The value of q also warrants further study . Furthermore , strict preventive measures have been widely adopted , such measure provides a prerequisite for common ventilation strategies to ensure a sufficiently low risk of airborne transmitted infection . 5 Conclusion This study employed Wells – Riley equation to predict infection probability in some typical scenarios based on the estimated quantum generation rate . The main conclusions are as follows : ( 1 ) A quantum generation rate of 14 – 48 h −1 for COVID - 19 is obtained with a reproductive number - based fitting approach . ( 2 ) The Infection probability less than 1 % requires ventilation rate larger than 100 – 350 m 3 / h per infector and 1200 – 4000 m 3 / h per infector for 0 . 25 h and 3 h of exposure . ( 3 ) Wearing an ordinary medical surgical mask is effective to reduce the infection risk .
