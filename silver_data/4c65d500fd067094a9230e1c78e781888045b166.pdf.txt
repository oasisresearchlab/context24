An indentation experiment involves ﬁve variables : in - denter shape , material behaviour of the substrate , contact size , ap - plied load and indentation depth . Only three variable are known afterwards , namely , indenter shape , plus load and depth as func - tion of time during the experiment because the contact size is not measured and the determination of the material properties is the very aim of the test ; two equations are needed to obtain a mathe - matically solvable system . For elastic materials , one of these equations is the ﬁxed – ﬁxed because it depends only on the indenter shape – relation between current depth and contact size ; this relation is used to eliminate once and for all the contact size in favor of the depth , thus yield - ing a single relation between load , depth and material properties in which only the latter variable remains unknown . For viscoelastic materials where hereditary integrals model the constitutive behaviour , the relation between depth and contact size is much more complicated as it usually depends also on the ( time - dependent ) properties of the material that is investigated . Solving the inverse problem , i . e . , determining the material properties from the experimental data , therefore needs both equations . Extending Sneddon’s analysis of the indentation problem for elastic materials ( I . N . Sneddon . Fourier transforms . McGraw - Hill Book Company , Inc . , New York , 1951 , p . 450 – 457 ) to include viscoelastic materials , the two equations mentioned above are derived and analysed . To ﬁnd the time dependence of the material properties the feasibility of Golden and Graham’s method of decomposing hereditary inte - grals ( J . M . Golden and G . A . C . Graham . Boundary value problems in linear viscoelasticity , Springer - Verlag , Berlin , 1988 , p . 63 – 69 ) is investigated and applied to two types of indentation processes . The ﬁrst is a single load - unload process and the second is a sinusoidally driven stationary state . Contents Extended summary viii Chapter 1 . Introduction 1 1 . 1 . General part 1 1 . 2 .

The size of the contact region is not measured and the determination of the material properties is the ultimate aim . Therefore , two equations are always necessary to obtain a mathemat - ically solvable system . One of these is the relation between the depth and the histories of contact size and material properties and the other links the histories of the depth , contact size and material properties to the load ; the two equations are coupled in a complicated way . For purely elastic materials , the relation between depth and con - tact size is speciﬁc for the indenter and invertible and independent of the material properties , thus enabling the elimination of the con - tact size altogether in favour of the depth ; for elastic materials only a single equation for a single unknown material parameter , the reduced modulus , remains and this reduced modulus is the proportionality fac - tor linking the load to a function of the depth . The elimination of the contact size is mostly not possible if the material is viscoelastic and in this case one needs to work with the two equations mentioned before . After adaptation of Sneddon’s analysis of the indentation of elas - tic materials [ 94 , p . 450 – 457 ] , these two equations are derived for homogeneous , isotropic and viscoelastic materials for which the stress - strain law is of the linear hereditary type having λ ( t ) and µ ( t ) as relax - ation functions . Apart from the requiring that λ ( t ) and µ ( t ) be physi - cally allowed , no other restrictions on their behaviour are needed . The functions λ ( t ) and µ ( t ) appear in the theory through a single function , here called ω ( t ) . The properties of these equations are investigated and it is shown that in the classic stress relaxation and creep experiments the depth - radius relation is of the same type as for elastic materials . However , in most other cases this relation depends on the material properties . The appearance of a ’nose’ in the load - depth curve is found to be quite natural because the ’nose’ occurs because the load always reaches viii EXTENDED SUMMARY ix its maximum ( the turning point ) before the depth does if the load - depth curve is smooth . If this curve is kinked at the turning point the depth may afterwards still be increasing thus rendering the slope at the start of the unloading branch negative . Although in this case a judicious choice of the history of the control variable may render this slope positive , the use of this slope – routinely used to eliminate plastic effects when estimating the reduced modulus for elastic materials – to estimate the initial elastic response is for viscoelastic materials not recommended . It is better to work with jumps in the rates , as jumps in the rates of depth , load and contact size are found to be synchronized . The ratio of jumps in the load and depth is proportional to the initial elastic response ω ( 0 ) and the contact size at the jump time ; this ratio can fulﬁl the same function as the slope in the elastic case . If the contact radius is known to increase , the load - depth equa - tion , though still of the hereditary type , follows from the expression for elastic materials by interchanging the elastic element ( the reduced modulus ) by a viscoelastic element with ω ( t ) as relaxation function . However , the monotonic increase requirement often limits or even for - bids the use of this procedure . During dynamic experiments , where a periodic perturbation is superposed on a constant control variable ( load or depth ) is eventually – that is , in the stationary state – the contact size also periodic , so certainly not monotonically increasing . To tackle the problem of a non - monotonic contact size , the theory of decomposing linear hereditary integrals of Golden and Graham [ 39 , p . 63 – 69 ] was used to rewrite the basis equations in a more accessible form with respect to depth , contact radius and load . The material properties , however , enter these equations in a more convoluted way as is demonstrated by showing how to ﬁnd ω ( t ) from the experimental time series for load and depth as generated by a single load - unload experiment . For dynamic indentation experiments controlled by a periodic per - turbation superposed on a constant depth or load it is shown that even - tually – in the stationary state – the maxima of depth and contact size occur simultaneously , whereas for load and contact size the minima coincide in time . These results are used to derive a matrix equation for each of two control types , i . e . , for a sinusoidal perturbation super - posed on a constant depth or a sinusoidal perturbation added to a con - stant load . The solution of these equations enables the construction of the shape of the contact size during a typical period . This shape is a function of the particular control parameters and the set ˜ p of ma - terial parameters deﬁning the assumed material function ω ( t ) , e . g . , a standard linear solid or a Prony series . Finally , combination of the re - constructed shape with the remaining experimental data results in a non - linear parameter identiﬁcation problem for the elements of the set x EXTENDED SUMMARY ˜ p . As examples , the reconstructed shapes of the contact size are inves - tigated assuming standard - linear - solid material behaviour for ω ( t ) . CHAPTER 1 Introduction 1 . 1 . General part Indentation is an experimental tool for investigating mechanical properties at a microstructural scale . The method has a long history after its ﬁrst appearance in 1859 and later standardization in 1900 by J . A . Brinell [ 80 ] . Most of the time the focus was on hardness of metals [ 99 ] by indenting the material and measuring the imprint , initially using a vernier caliper and later a microscope . Originally the loads where relatively large but today the tendency is towards nano - sized loads and penetration depths – so - called nanoindentation [ 54 , p . 853 – 856 ] – thus enabling investigating materials on ever decreasing scales , down to sizes typical of thin coatings ( see , e . g . , [ 72 , 105 ] ) or suitable for studying polymer gels , biomaterials ( see , e . g . , [ 68 , 81 ] ) and , possibly , even cells [ 53 ] . The capacity of scanning probe microscopy equipment , particularly atomic force microscopes , to function as nanoindentation instruments has also been investigated ( see e . g . , VanLandingham , Vil - larrubia , Guthrie , and Meyers [ 108 ] and also Attard [ 6 ] ) . A comprehensive analysis of indentation from the point of view of scaling and dimensional analysis is found in the seminal review pa - per of Cheng and Cheng [ 18 ] where also their earlier results on these methods are collected and applied to indented half - spaces showing elasto - plastic material behaviour including work hardening , power - law creep behaviour or linear viscoelastic behaviour . Scaling is also used by Cao and Cheng [ 13 , 14 ] in their studies on pressing inden - ters of arbitrary shape into purely viscoelastic or composite ( matrix : viscoelastic , ﬁller : elastic ) substrates , respectively . The modern version of an indentation experiment is known under the names : load - depth sensing , depth - sensing indentation or instru - mented indentation ; one indents a material , records continuously the load and the depth of the indenter tip and subsequently calculates material properties from the experimental data ( see e . g . [ 74 , 79 ] or the monograph [ 34 ] ) . A dynamical variant of the load - depth sensing method is known as the continuous - stiffness method . Here a small si - nusoidal variation is superposed on the global input variable ( load or depth ) and the resulting variation of the global output variable is then used to investigate the elastic or viscoelastic properties of the material [ 25 , 59 , 67 , 69 , 71 , 79 , 82 ] , [ 62 , p . 81 – 83 ] , [ 34 , Chapter 7 ] . Measuring 1 2 1 . INTRODUCTION the time - dependence of the shape of the imprint and analysis of these data is sometimes even extended into the time period after load re - moval ; so - called rebound indentation [ 3 – 5 , 12 ] . Finally , load - depth sensing is also used as a diagnostic tool since cracking and delamina - tion of coatings may lead to jumps , plateaus or kinks in a plot of load versus depth [ 72 , 105 ] . Mathematically , indentation is a contact problem with time - depen - dent boundary conditions ; time dependent because the prescribed con - trol variable ( load or depth ) is time - dependent and , more importantly , because the contact region changes generally with time . For viscoelas - tic materials the time dependence of the material behaviour comes into play also . The problem of indenting elastic materials by axisymmet - ric indenters has been solved by Sneddon in closed form ( see [ 94 , p . 450 – 457 ] , [ 95 , 96 ] and also the paper of Lebedev and Uﬂiand [ 65 ] ) and the solution was found to be useful also for cases where the in - denter is not a body of revolution [ 84 ] . Unfortunately , the results for elastic materials cannot always be transferred to the viscoelastic case using the elastic - viscoelastic correspondence principle on account of the time - dependence of the contact region [ 60 , 66 , 87 ] . To proceed some researchers extended the correspondence principle [ 44 , 46 , 47 , 49 ] to cases with monotonic increasing or decreasing boundary regions , whereas others started from ﬁrst principles or otherwise transformed elastic results assuming that the ( time - dependent ) contact region is known in advance [ 38 , 40 , 42 , 43 , 45 , 48 , 60 , 89 , 102 , 103 , 113 ] . Not all mathematical results concerning contact problems can be used for processing load - depth sensing data because in indention ex - periments the material behaviour and the size of the contact region is unknown – determination of material behaviour is the reason why the experiment is conducted in the ﬁrst place – whereas in classic contact problems these variables are normally given data and the focus is on calculating the stress distribution under the indenter . Nonetheless , from all studies mentioned earlier it is clear that the precise depen - dence of the contact region on time is of vital importance . A monotonic increasing size is the most simple situation and a monotonic decrea - sing 1 contact size is more complicated but also relatively simple . The case most important in practice , i . e . , the case of a contact size consec - utively increasing and decreasing , is the most complicated situation even if the contact size is known in advance [ 102 , 103 ] . In load - depth sensing experiments the size of the contact region is normally not mea - sured and the processing of the data for viscoelastic materials – in a general sense the topic of this paper – is much more complicated than the same analysis for elastic materials . 1 As the contact size is initially zero , a monotonic decrease is only possible after an initial jump . 1 . 1 . GENERAL PART 3 To explain the foregoing in more detail it is worthwhile to recap ﬁrst brieﬂy Sneddon’s analysis ( [ 94 , p . 450 – 457 ] , [ 95 , 96 ] ) of indenting an ideally elastic half - space ( elastic modulus E ; Poisson’s ratio ν ) with a rigid axisymmetric indenter with shape proﬁle f ( r ) ( Fig . 2 . 1 , left ) . The load p is proportional to the elasticity factor ω E = E / { 2 ( 1 − ν 2 ) } , it depends furthermore on the depth h and on the size of the contact region , i . e . , the contact radius c ( Fig . 2 . 1 , right ) . Mathematically the ﬁrst results are ( 1 . 1 ) p = 4 ω E (cid:169) ch − (cid:76) ( c ) (cid:170) , with (cid:76) ( c ) = (cid:90) c 0 f (cid:48) ( r ) (cid:112) c 2 − r 2 d r . The contact radius is not measured in the experiments and an ad - ditional relation is needed to eliminate the contact radius from the load formula ( 1 . 1 ) . This relation follows from the requirement that for smooth indenter proﬁles 2 the normal stress must be bounded ev - erywhere and it follows that the current contact radius is slaved only to the current depth and this relation furthermore only depends on the indenter shape , that is c = (cid:67) ( h ) which is the inversion of h = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ) . Substituting c = (cid:67) ( h ) in ( 1 . 1 ) leads to an expression for the load - depth curve : ( 1 . 2 ) p = 4 ω E (cid:70) ( h ) , with (cid:70) ( h ) = (cid:67) ( h ) h − (cid:76) ( (cid:67) ( h ) ) and (cid:70) (cid:48) ( h ) = (cid:67) ( h ) . As (cid:70) ( h ) is a known function of the depth , ( 1 . 2 ) can theoretically be used to determine the elasticity factor , ω E , from the experimental data but in practice the slope , S = 4 ω E c , of the load - depth curve is used for that purpose . Due to plastic deformation , which is always present to some extend , the contact radius is determined from an estimate of the contact depth , h c , using the data for h and p / S at full load , the formula h c = h − ε p / S ( ε : an indenter speciﬁc number ) and the area function , A ( h c ) , which equals π c 2 . The resulting value for c is again combined with S to calculate ω E ( [ 32 , 84 ] , [ 34 , Chapter 3 ] ) . While for ideally elastic materials the relation between current contact radius and depth depends only on the indenter shape , for ide - ally viscoelastic materials normally also the material properties and the deformation history come into play . Only when the contact ra - dius is a monotonic increasing function of time ( from the start up to the current time ) is the situation exactly the same as for the elastic case ( Chap . 3 . 1 ) and it is possible to generalize ( 1 . 2 ) using the elastic - viscoelastic analogy , a fact already noted by Lee and Radok [ 66 ] and used during the ensuing decades as the following list of representa - tive – though not exhaustive – list of references shows : [ 16 , 17 , 19 – 24 , 37 , 59 , 61 , 64 , 69 – 71 , 88 , 90 – 93 , 107 , 110 ] . So , the results obtained in this way apply only to the case of an increasing contact radius . In other cases , i . e a decreasing contact radius following a sudden or a 2 The indenter tip is excluded from this smoothness requirement , i . e . , it might be sharp . 4 1 . INTRODUCTION smooth increase , the relation between the depth and the contact ra - dius also depends on the viscoelastic relaxation properties of the sub - strate and generalization of ( 1 . 2 ) is no longer allowed and a different approach is needed such as Greenwood’s [ 50 ] . This applies to conven - tional ( Chap . 3 . 2 , 3 . 3 & 5 ) and dynamic load - depth sensing ( Chap . 3 . 4 ) alike . p h slope S m t 1 h t m p p h t 1 t m load unload p h t 1 = tm load unload ( a ) ( d ) ( c ) ( b ) h m p m load load unload un l oad Figure 1 . 1 . Possible plots of load p versus depth h for ideally elastic ( a ) and viscoelastic materials with smooth ( b ) and kinked ( c & d ) contact area . Time is an increasing parameter along the curves and t 1 ≤ t m with p maximal at t 1 and h at t m . Occurrence of a nose ( b and c ) if t 1 < t m . Another difference between the elastic and the viscoelastic case is the occasional appearance of a ’nose’ ( ’bulge’ ) in the data ( Fig . 1 . 1b and 1 . 1c ) . See , for example , Briscoe , Firori , and Pelillo [ 11 ] for indentation data about polymeric surfaces , Ngan and Tang [ 76 ] for polypropylene or ¸Sahin , Uzun , Kölemen , and Uçar [ 29 ] for experimental data about β - Sn single crystals and Cheng and Cheng [ 18 ] for numerical simu - lations using standard linear solid material behaviour . When a ’nose’ appears the maximum of the load at time t 1 in Fig . 1 . 1 and that of the depth at time t m in Fig . 1 . 1 do not appear simultaneously but after another , i . e . , t 1 ≤ t m . Physically this means that between t 1 and t m unloading has already set in , the load decreased , whereas the inden - ter still moves further into the substrate . The ’nose’ is actually about the slope of the load - depth curve during the ﬁrst stage of unloading ; the slope becomes negative whereas the use of the conventional slope formula S = 4 ω E c as derived from ( 1 . 2 ) needs a positive value . This raised the question whether the classic procedure to determine the initial elastic response can be used for viscoelastic materials or not . Experimentally , it was found that the ’nose’ might disappear if a suitable load schedule was used , e . g . if prior to t 1 a sufﬁciently long load hold period is introduced [ 11 , 29 ] and this was corroborated by the analytical and numerical results of Cheng et al . [ 24 ] , Ngan and Tang [ 76 ] . Moreover , similar studies of Cheng and Cheng [ 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ] , Cheng et al . [ 24 ] , Ngan and Tang [ 76 ] show , for various types of indenters , that the ’nose’ might also disappear when unloading is fast enough . However , generally it is not altogether clear under what circumstances the ’nose’ is present ( Fig . 1 . 1b & 1 . 1c ) or not ( Fig . 1 . 1d ) . Research of Feng and Ngan [ 33 ] , Tang and Ngan [ 101 ] and Ngan , Wang , Tang , and Sze [ 77 ] suggested that the conventional procedure 1 . 2 . SYMBOLS AND NOTATION 5 for determination of elastic properties can also be used for measuring the initial elastic response of viscoelastic materials if , as suggested by de With [ 30 , p . 609 – 610 ] , effectively the ratio of rate jumps in load and depth data is used instead of the slope of the unloading curve and this suggestion was later heuristically substantiated by Ngan and Tang [ 75 ] and used for soft - tissue characterization by Tang and Ngan [ 100 ] . For this reason it seems worthwhile to study the effect of arbitrary rate jumps in more detail . The aim of the paper is to revisit the indentation problem particu - larly in view of the question how during load - depth sensing material properties of homogeneous isotropic linear viscoelastic materials inﬂu - ence the relation between contact radius on the one hand and load and depth on the other . The question becomes even more urgent for dynamic load - depth sensing , i . e . , when a periodic perturbation is superposed on the global control variable ( depth or load ) . In these cases points on the substrate surface may repeatedly move in - and outside the contact region mean - ing that at these points the boundary condition may change repeatedly from type – from a prescribed stress to a prescribed displacement and back – and the times these changes occur is not known at all . For these situation Golden and Graham [ 39 , p . 173 – 178 ] and Graham and Golden [ 48 ] developed a generalized Boussinesq formula for a contact problem under varying load . The analysis performed by these authors is exclusively formulated in terms of relations between displacements and stress and between depth and loads and the contact region is only present in a hidden form . The idea here is to obtain explicit formu - lae relating load , depth , contact radius and material functions ; results mirroring those of Sneddon for elastic materials ( 1 . 1 ) . These results will be combined with the theory of decomposing hereditary integrals as developed by Golden and Graham [ 39 , p . 63 – 68 ] . The main focus will be on the role of the contact radius . The problem of numerically identifying the material parameters is not considered here in any detail . This is a problem in its own right be - cause noisiness of the data or too strict assumptions on the decay rate of the material functions might lead to strong ill - conditioned identiﬁ - cation problems ; the studies performed by Sorvari and Malinen [ 97 ] and by Ciambella and coworkers [ 26 ] can serve as an introduction to these problems . 1 . 2 .

When f also depends on a spatial variable , say r , the notation 〈 f 〉 T ( r ) is used . Dots denote partial differentiation to time - like arguments and primes partial differentiation to spatial variables . So , F (cid:48) = ∂ F ( r , t ) / ∂ r and ˙ F = ∂ F ( r , t ) / ∂ t . For the viscoelastic material behaviour the theory of the Stieltjes convolution including the corresponding notation is used ( see the sem - inal paper by Gurtin and Sternberg [ 52 ] or – for a summary – Ap - pendix A ) . In short , the Stieltjes convolution s ( t ) of two functions f ( t ) and g ( t ) is the Stieltjes integral s ( t ) = (cid:82) t −∞ f ( t − τ ) d g ( τ ) and – using the Stieltjes convolution operator ∗ d – this is notated as s = f ∗ d g . The Stieltjes inverse of f is denoted by the superscript i , i . e . , f ∗ d f i = H . When f and g depend on t and also on a spatial variable y the Stieltjes convolution is also a function of these two variables , i . e . , [ f ∗ d g ] ( y , t ) . Note that the operations convolution of functions and substitution of a time - dependent spatial variable , say c ( t ) , do not commute ; generally [ f ∗ d g ] ( y , t ) | y = c (cid:54) = [ { f | y = c } ∗ d { g | y = c } ] ( t ) . CHAPTER 2 Experiment , material and governing equations 2 . 1 . Experimental setup Prior to indentation , ( Fig . 2 . 1 , middle ) , the material is in its virgin , stress free state with the indenter only touching the material ; depth and load are both zero in this time period . Starting at t = 0 , a rigid ax - isymmetric indenter with surface proﬁle f ( r ) , ( Fig . 2 . 1 - left ) is pressed into a viscoelastic half - space ( Fig . 2 . 1 - right ) and the resulting pene - tration depth h and the necessary force p ( t ) are recorded as function of time . These two functions – both reckoned to be positive for his - torical reasons – plus the information about the indenter shape f ( r ) constitute the experimental data from which the material behaviour of the half space must be extracted . Only convex and non - ﬂat indenter z axis r axis f ( r ) surface at z = 0 indenter viscoelastichalf - space total depth h ( t ) contact radius c ( t ) contactdepth h c ( t ) time t < 0 time t > 0 load p ( t ) Figure 2 . 1 . Axi - symmetric indenter proﬁle f ( r ) ( left ) and indentation process ( middle and right ) indicating load p ( t ) , indentation depth h ( t ) , contact radius c ( t ) and contact depth h c ( t ) = f ( c ( t ) ) . shapes ( Fig . 2 . 1 , left ) are considered ; f ( r ) is a twice continuously dif - ferentiable positive function for all r > 0 excluding , perhaps , the point r = 0 as for a cone . This implies also f (cid:48) ( r ) > 0 and f (cid:48)(cid:48) ( r ) ≥ 0 for all r > 0 . 2 . 2 . Material behaviour The half - space material is homogeneous and isotropic with a linear , non - ageing viscoelastic relation between stresses σ ij and strains (cid:178) ij [ 52 ] ( 2 . 1 ) σ ij = δ ij [ (cid:178) kk ∗ d λ ] + 2 [ (cid:178) ij ∗ d µ ] . The stress relaxation functions λ ( t ) and µ ( t ) in ( 2 . 1 ) are real causal functions , i . e . , they are zero for t < 0 . At t = 0 , positive jumps λ 0 = λ ( 0 + ) and µ 0 = µ ( 0 + ) occur with λ 0 and µ 0 the Lamé constants of the 7 8 2 . DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM initial elastic response of the material . Both function are assumed to admit a relaxation spectrum representation which implies that they are continuously differentiable to any order for t > 0 , completely mono - tonic [ 7 , 31 ] and that the material has fading memory [ 1 , 2 ] ; λ and µ are positive and monotonically decreasing functions of time [ 1 , 10 ] with non - zero positive constant asymptotic values [ 27 ] . All these prop - erties are sufﬁcient for dissipative material behaviour [ 10 , 31 , 51 ] and guarantee unique solutions to mixed boundary value problems [ 10 ] . Because λ 0 (cid:54) = 0 and µ 0 (cid:54) = 0 , the Stieltjes inverses of λ and µ exist [ 52 ] and they are creep functions , that is , they are real , causal , positive and increasing functions for t > 0 ( see Chap . 2 . 2 . 1 ) . Often the assumption is made that λ and µ differ only by a multi - plicative constant , i . e . , Poisson’s ratio is constant , whichever way it is deﬁned [ 57 , 104 , 106 ] . This assumption will not be made here because it would imply that the bulk modulus relaxes at the same rate as the shear modulus which is , according to Hilton [ 57 ] , not the case for real materials . 2 . 2 . 1 . Monotonicity of the relaxation and creep functions . Let w be any of the two reduced stress relaxation functions occurring in the constitutive equation ( 2 . 1 ) ; i . e . , w = µ / µ 0 or w = λ / λ 0 . Then , according to the previous paragraph , w ∈ H 2 , w 0 = 1 , ˙ w < 0 , 0 < w ≤ 1 , ¨ w > 0 , w > 0 in the limit t → ∞ and the Stieltjes inverse g of w exists because w 0 (cid:54) = 0 ( see Appendix A ) . The ﬁrst mean value theorem of integration applied to w ∗ d g = H shows that a function ζ ( t ) exists such that 0 < ζ ( t ) < t for t > 0 and { 1 − w ( t ) } / { t w ( t − ζ ( t ) ) } = ˙ g ( ζ ( t ) ) > 0 ∀ t > 0 ( 2 . 2 ) plus lim t ↓ 0 ˙ g ( ζ ( t ) ) = ˙ g 0 = − ˙ w 0 . ( 2 . 3 ) Therefore , the reduced creep function g = w i is a positive monotonic increasing function . It is also bounded if w ( ∞ ) > 0 because g ( t ) w ( t ) ≤ 1 [ 39 , p . 11 ] . The same analysis also applies to the material functions ω and (cid:36) introduced in Chap . 2 . 4 . 2 . 3 . Boundary conditions The symmetry present in the shape , material properties and load - ing of the system ensures that all local quantities depend only on the radial and axial spatial variables , r and z , and the time t . For the same reason is the contact region , the region where the material sur - face conforms frictionless to the indenter , uniquely characterized by the ( non - negative ) contact radius c ( t ) . The boundary conditions for the normal surface displacement u ( r , t ) and the normal surface stress 2 . 4 . NORMAL SURFACE STRESS AND DISPLACEMENT 9 σ ( r , t ) are 1 ( 2 . 4 ) u ( r , t ) = − h ( t ) + f ( r ) for r < c ( t ) and σ ( r , t ) = 0 for r > c ( t ) . The surface shear stress must always be zero everywhere . 2 . 4 . Normal surface stress and displacement Sneddon’s approach [ 94 , p . 450 – 457 ] to indentation of homoge - neous , isotropic , linear elastic materials can easily be adapted because of the linearity , homogeneity and isotropy of the viscoelastic material combined with the existence of the Stieltjes inverses of the viscoelastic material functions . The use of the generalized Love strain function is allowed [ 52 ] and a lengthy calculation shows that its Hankel trans - form is related to normal stress and displacement at the surface by ( 2 . 5 ) σ ( r , t ) = (cid:90) ∞ 0 ξ J o ( ξ r ) ψ ( ξ , t ) d ξ , u ( r , t ) = (cid:90) ∞ 0 J o ( ξ r ) [ ψ ∗ d (cid:36) ] ( ξ , t ) d ξ . For arbitrary ψ is mechanical equilibrium and correct asymptotic be - haviour guaranteed and the shear stress is zero everywhere . The ma - terial behaviour enters ( 2 . 5 ) through the real causal creep function (cid:36) and ( 2 . 6 ) (cid:36) = { ( λ + µ ) i + µ i } / 2 , with (cid:36) 0 = 2 ( 1 − ν 20 ) / E 0 > 0 , where E 0 and ν 0 indicate Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio for the initial elastic response , respectively . A real causal relaxation function ω , the Stieltjes inverse of (cid:36) , exists because (cid:36) 0 > 0 ( see Appendix A ) . Speciﬁcally , ω = (cid:36) i = 2 µ − 2 { µ ∗ d µ } ∗ d { ( λ + 2 µ ) i } , with ω 0 = 1 / (cid:36) 0 , ( 2 . 7 ) and also [ u ∗ d ω ] ( r , t ) = (cid:90) ∞ 0 J o ( ξ r ) ψ ( ξ , t ) d ξ . ( 2 . 8 ) The properties of λ and µ ( see Section 2 . 2 ) guarantee that ω is a pos - itive decreasing function with ω ( ∞ ) > 0 and , consequently – as shown in Chap . 2 . 2 . 1 – that (cid:36) is a positive and increasing function of time for t > 0 and also that (cid:36) ( ∞ ) is positive and ﬁnite . Although the material behaviour is characterized by two material functions , the inﬂuence of 1 As in Sneddon’s treatment [ 96 ] , the normal stress is required to remain bounded everywhere and the same boundary conditions will be used . This means that the radial surface displacement is free to take any value although it should in fact be constrained to remain outside the indenter too . For elastic materials it has been shown [ 8 , 35 ] that not enforcing this constraint leads to errors in the deter - mined value of Young’s modulus . However , incorporation of this constraint is only possible using ﬁnite element methods or other approximate methods [ 8 , 55 , 111 ] . As the focus here is on an analytical treatment this constraint is not enforced . 10 2 . DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM these functions appears here in a lumped form 2 , i . e . , the function ω . This function is , just like λ and µ , also completely monotonic . At the end of this chapter , and further on , the reduced material functions , i . e . , φ ( t ) = ω ( t ) / ω 0 and ϕ ( t ) = (cid:36) ( t ) / (cid:36) 0 are also used . 2 . 5 . Automatically meeting the stress boundary condition Lebedev and Uﬂiand [ 65 ] and Sneddon [ 95 ] showed that substitut - ing for ψ in ( 2 . 5 ) the equation ( 2 . 9 ) ψ ( ξ , t ) = (cid:90) c ( t ) 0 θ ( y , t ) cos ξ y d y results in σ = 0 if r > c , i . e . , the boundary condition for the stress is sat - isﬁed automatically irrespective of the choice of θ . The expression for σ , the ﬁrst of ( 2 . 5 ) , is now found to be the sum of two terms . The ﬁrst , the term θ ( c , t ) / ( c 2 − r 2 ) 1 / 2 , is a ﬂat punch solution which is singular at the edge of the contact region . Sneddon determined the contact radius for non - ﬂat indenter shapes ( cone , parabola , sphere , . . . ) by requiring that the axial normal surface stress be bounded everywhere [ 96 ] . To meet this requirement , the Sneddon condition that ( 2 . 10 ) lim r ↑ c ( t ) θ ( r , t ) = θ ( c ( t ) , t ) = 0 [ 96 ] is also imposed , thus rendering the ﬂat punch term zero . The remaining term – the actual stress – is bounded and continuous across the contact radius [ 96 ] : ( 2 . 11 ) σ ( r , t ) =   − (cid:90) c ( t ) r θ (cid:48) ( y , t ) d y (cid:112) y 2 − r 2 for r ≤ c ( t ) , 0 for r > c ( t ) . All attention is now focussed on the function θ ( r , t ) . 2 . 6 . The boundary condition for the surface displacement For the surface displacement in ( 2 . 8 ) , the ’Ansatz’ ( 2 . 9 ) results in [ u ∗ d ω ] ( r , t ) = r (cid:90) 0 ϑ c ( y , t ) d y (cid:112) r 2 − y 2 , ( 2 . 12 ) [ 95 ] , or , alternatively , in u ( r , t ) = r (cid:90) 0 [ ϑ c ∗ d (cid:36) ] ( y , t ) d y (cid:112) r 2 − y 2 . ( 2 . 13 ) 2 Huang and Lu [ 58 ] argue that the two functions λ ( t ) and µ ( t ) can be determined by using two different indenters , an axisymmetric and an asymmetric one . 2 . 7 . THE FINAL EQUATIONS 11 The function ϑ c is deﬁned by : ϑ c ( r , t ) = θ ( r , t ) H ( c ( t ) − r ) plus – to en - sure that the stress is bounded – that ϑ c ( c ( t ) , t ) = 0 . Application of the boundary condition for the displacement in ( 2 . 13 ) shows that ( 2 . 14 ) (cid:90) r 0 [ ϑ c ∗ d (cid:36) ] ( y , t ) d y (cid:112) r 2 − y 2 = { − h ( t ) + f ( r ) } H ( t ) for 0 ≤ r ≤ c ( t ) and , after taking the limit r ↓ 0 of ( 2 . 12 ) , that ( 2 . 15 ) − [ h ∗ d ω ] ( t ) = π 2 θ ( 0 , t ) . 2 . 7 . The ﬁnal equations 2 . 7 . 1 . Equations in the complete ( r , t ) - plane . Inversion of the equations ( 2 . 12 ) and ( 2 . 13 ) [ 85 , Sec . 1 . 1 - 6 , Eq . 40 ] plus introduction of the function L and its spatial derivative L (cid:48) through ( 2 . 16 ) L ( r , t ) = (cid:90) r 0 u (cid:48) ( y , t ) (cid:113) r 2 − y 2 d y and L (cid:48) ( r , t ) = r (cid:90) r 0 u (cid:48) ( y , t ) d y (cid:112) r 2 − y 2 , produces two equivalent expressions which are related by a convolu - tion ( 2 . 17 ) π 2 ϑ c ( r , t ) = [ { L (cid:48) − h } ∗ d ω ] ( r , t ) ⇔ L (cid:48) ( r , t ) − h ( t ) = π 2 [ ϑ c ∗ d (cid:36) ] ( r , t ) . Lebedev and Uﬂiand [ 65 ] and Sneddon [ 96 ] showed by integration of ( 2 . 11 ) that the total load 3 , p ( t ) , is ( 2 . 18 ) p ( t ) = − 2 π (cid:90) ∞ 0 r σ ( r , t ) d r = − 2 π (cid:90) c ( t ) 0 θ ( y , t ) d y . Apparently , the spatial integrals of ( 2 . 17 ) are also important . Deﬁne ( 2 . 19 ) ℘ c ( r , t ) = 2 π (cid:90) r 0 ϑ c ( y , t ) d y = 2 π (cid:90) r 0 θ ( y , t ) H ( c ( t ) − y ) d y which becomes with ( 2 . 18 ) ( 2 . 20 ) ℘ c ( r , t ) = − p ( t ) r ≥ c ( t ) . So , the spatial integrals of ( 2 . 17 ) are ( 2 . 21 ) ℘ c ( r , t ) = 4 [ { L − rh } ∗ d ω ] ( r , t ) ⇔ 4 { L ( r , t ) − rh ( t ) } = [ ℘ c ∗ d (cid:36) ] ( r , t ) , and they are also related by a convolution . 3 For historical reasons the load is reckoned positive , so a minus sign is intro - duced because the stress is actually negative ( compressive ) . 12 2 . DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM 2 . 7 . 2 . Intermezzo : the indenter characteristic function (cid:76) . The functions L ( r , t ) and L (cid:48) ( r , t ) are continuously differentiable in both arguments and they will play a pivotal role in the rest of the analysis . Whenever r ≤ c ( t ) , the indenter shape completely determines L and L (cid:48) because u (cid:48) = f (cid:48) in this case . This is the reason why the indenter char - acteristic function (cid:76) , the spatial derivative 4 (cid:76) (cid:48) and the inverse (cid:67) of (cid:76) (cid:48) are introduced ( see also Appendix B ) ( 2 . 22 ) (cid:76) ( r ) = (cid:90) r 0 f (cid:48) ( y ) (cid:113) r 2 − y 2 d y , (cid:76) (cid:48) ( r ) = r (cid:90) r 0 f (cid:48) ( y ) d y (cid:112) r 2 − y 2 , (cid:67) ( (cid:76) (cid:48) ( r ) ) = r . Below the contact radius curve ( region 1 in Fig . 2 . 2 ) , i . e . , for r < c ( t ) , time radius contactradius c 2 1 3 Figure 2 . 2 . For ( r , t ) ∈ region 1 : L (cid:48) ( r , t ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( r ) . For ( r , t ) ∈ region 2 : L (cid:48) ( r , t ) = h ( t ) . But for ( r , t ) ∈ region 3 only [ { L (cid:48) − h } ∗ d ω ] ( r , t ) = 0 applies . is L ( r , t ) = (cid:76) ( r ) and L (cid:48) ( r , t ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( r ) . For points above the curve ( region 2 and 3 in Fig . 2 . 2 ) , [ { L (cid:48) − h } ∗ d ω ] = 0 because ϑ c ( r , t ) = 0 here ( see the ﬁrst of ( 2 . 17 ) ) . If – in addition – a line of constant radius did not cross the contact radius curve up to the present time t , i . e . , the region 2 in Fig . 2 . 2 , the stronger result L (cid:48) ( r , τ ) = h ( τ ) for 0 < τ < t follows from the second of ( 2 . 17 ) . Finally , along the curve of the contact radius , continuity of L and L (cid:48) implies L ( c ( t ) , t ) = (cid:76) ( c ( t ) ) and L (cid:48) ( c ( t ) , t ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) . 2 . 7 . 3 . The equations relating depth , contact radius and load . These equations are found by restricting ( 2 . 17 ) and ( 2 . 21 ) to the curve of the contact radius . This leads to ( 2 . 23a ) [ L (cid:48) ∗ d ω ] ( r , t ) | r = c ( t ) = [ h ∗ d ω ] ( t ) , ( 2 . 23b ) (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) = h ( t ) + π 2 [ ϑ c ∗ d (cid:36) ] ( r , t ) | r = c ( t ) , as two , equivalent , equations relating depth , contact radius and mate - rial properties plus two additional equations ( 2 . 24a ) p ( t ) = 4 (cid:110) c ( t ) [ h ∗ d ω ] ( t ) − [ L ∗ d ω ] ( r , t ) | r = c ( t ) (cid:111) , ( 2 . 24b ) [ ℘ c ∗ d (cid:36) ] ( r , t ) | r = c ( t ) = 4 (cid:110) (cid:76) ( c ( t ) ) − c ( t ) h ( t ) (cid:111) , 4 The characteristic function (cid:76) (cid:48) ( r ) , its mathematical deﬁnition originally due to [ 96 ] , also plays a pivotal role in the theory of dimensionality reduction in contact mechanics and friction of Popov and coworkers [ 5 ] , [ 86 , Chapter 3 and 17 ] . In this theory it is called the equivalent indenter proﬁle . 2 . 7 . THE FINAL EQUATIONS 13 involving also the load p and the ’load - like’ function ℘ c ; the latter two equations are also equivalent . The two equations ( 2 . 17 ) are related by a convolution , but the two derived equations in ( 2 . 23 ) are not . Similarly , the two equations ( 2 . 21 ) are related by a convolution but between the two equations in ( 2 . 24 ) no such relation exists . Convoluting with ω or (cid:36) and substituting r = c ( t ) does not commute . The only exception occurs when ω is a step func - tion and this is in fact the elastic case with ω ( t ) = ω E H ( t ) ; convolution is in this particular case equivalent to conventional multiplication . A similar result is found for the initial – elastic – response of a viscoelas - tic material . Indeed , in the limit t ↓ 0 both equations ( 2 . 23 ) lead to the same result , i . e . , h 0 = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c 0 ) and from this c 0 = (cid:67) ( h 0 ) , and the two equations ( 2 . 24 ) also generate the same formula : p 0 = 4 ω 0 (cid:70) ( h 0 ) . From ( 2 . 23a ) it is seen that the relation between depth and contact radius generally depends on the reduced relaxation function φ but not on the elasticity factor ω 0 because this factor can be divided out of this equation . Division of the load equation ( 2 . 24a ) by ω 0 is equiva - lent to using ω 0 as the unit of stress . The remaining equations , that is , the equations ( 2 . 23b ) and ( 2 . 24b ) , are already divided by this factor because [ ϑ c ∗ d (cid:36) ] = [ ( ϑ c / ω 0 ) ∗ d ϕ ] and [ ℘ c ∗ d (cid:36) ] = [ ( ℘ c / ω 0 ) ∗ d ϕ ] . All this suggests that it is advisable to determine the material function in two steps . In a ﬁrst step the elasticity factor ω 0 governing the initial elastic response is determined and , subsequently , in a second step the after - effects as represented by the reduced relaxation and creep functions φ and ϕ , respectively . CHAPTER 3 Complete and partially closed form solutions The formulae ( 2 . 23 ) immediately produce relations between depth and contact radius in two simple cases , namely a monotonic increasing ( non - decreasing ) or a monotonically decreasing 1 ( non - increasing ) con - tact radius . The classic relaxation experiments – step - shaped depth as experimental control variable – and creep experiment – step - shaped load as experimental control variable – are both found to be examples of the former case . 3 . 1 . A monotonically increasing contact radius For a monotonically increasing contact radius ( Fig . 3 . 1 ) , the in - equality c ( τ ) < c ( t ) if 0 < τ < t applies for arbitrary times t in a con - nected interval 0 < t < t max . Therefore , [ ϑ c ∗ d (cid:36) ] ( r , t ) | r = c ( t ) = 0 plus [ ℘ c ∗ d (cid:36) ] ( r , t ) | r = c ( t ) = − [ p ∗ d (cid:36) ] ( t ) , also for arbitrary times in this inter - radius c ( t ) time c 0 c ( t ) radius time Figure 3 . 1 . Monotonically increasing ( left ) or decreasing contact radius ( right ) . val . The second of ( 2 . 23 ) is now : ( 3 . 1 ) (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) = h ( t ) ⇒ c ( t ) = (cid:67) ( h ( t ) ) , i . e . , the contact radius only depends on the indenter shape and the depth 2 . The second of the load equation ( 2 . 24 ) now takes the form ( 3 . 2 ) [ p ∗ d (cid:36) ] ( t ) = 4 (cid:110) c ( t ) h ( t ) − (cid:76) ( c ( t ) ) (cid:111) , and the contact radius can be eliminated from the right - hand side of ( 3 . 2 ) with the aid of the second of ( 3 . 1 ) . Deﬁning (cid:70) ( h ) = h (cid:67) ( h ) − (cid:76) ( (cid:67) ( h ) ) one eventually ﬁnds equations involving only the experimental data and the material properties , i . e . , ( 3 . 3 ) [ p ∗ d (cid:36) ] ( t ) = 4 (cid:70) ( h ( t ) ) ⇔ p ( t ) = 4 [ (cid:70) ( h ) ∗ d ω ] ( t ) . 1 Obviously , this is only possible after an initial jump . 2 A pure example of an experimental study of this type is that of Gang Huang and Hongbing Lu [ 36 ] where a linearly increasing depth is used as control variable . 14 3 . 2 . A MONOTONICALLY DECREASING CONTACT RADIUS 15 Speciﬁcally , for a conical and a parabolic indenter one ﬁnds the load to be proportional to [ h 2 ∗ d ω ] and [ h 3 / 2 ∗ d ω ] , respectively , with the propor - tionality constants depending on the shape parameters of the indenter ( see Appendix B ) . The formulae ( 3 . 3 ) are generalizations of the elastic results using the elastic - viscoelastic analogy and this enables determination of the material function ω using conventional Laplace transformation meth - ods with p and (cid:70) ( h ) as experimental input [ 23 ] . An alternative way is to solve the integrals equations ( 3 . 3 ) directly for (cid:36) or ω [ 73 ] . If initial jumps in the load and depth occur , i . e . , p 0 > 0 and h 0 > 0 , the Stieltjes inverses of p and (cid:70) ( h ) exist and (cid:36) = 4 [ (cid:70) ( h ) ∗ d p i ] or ω = [ (cid:70) ( h ) i ∗ d p ] . Oth - erwise , i . e . , load and depth changing smoothly from zero , the type of the Volterra integral equations ( 3 . 3 ) changes from second to ﬁrst kind ; ﬁnding (cid:36) or ω is more complicated [ 85 , Sections 8 . 3 & 8 . 4 ] . 3 . 1 . 1 . Special case 1 : the classic relaxation experiment . A step - shaped contact radius can be seen as a ( non - decreasing ) limiting case of a piecewise linear contact radius . It then follows from ( 3 . 1 ) that a step shaped depth , i . e . , h ( t ) = h 0 H ( t ) , is needed to achieve this and the second of ( 3 . 3 ) shows that p ( t ) = 4 (cid:70) ( h 0 ) ω ( t ) . The control vari - able is a step in the depth and the resulting load is proportional to the relaxation function ; this is the case of a classic relaxation experi - ment . For all members of the considered class of constitutive equations the function ω ( t ) approaches a constant value if t → ∞ and the same applies to the load response to the classic relaxation experiment , i . e . , p ( ∞ ) = 4 (cid:70) ( h 0 ) ω ( ∞ ) 3 . 1 . 2 . Special case 2 : the classic creep experiment . Alterna - tively , in the classic creep experiment a step - shaped jump in the con - trol variable , the load , is applied . Use of p ( t ) = p 0 H ( t ) in ( 3 . 2 ) shows that p 0 (cid:36) ( t ) = 4 { c ( t ) h ( t ) − (cid:76) ( c ( t ) ) } , ( 3 . 4 ) and after differentiation that p 0 ˙ (cid:36) ( t ) = 4 c ( t ) ˙ h ( t ) + 4 ˙ c ( t ) { h ( t ) − (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) } . ( 3 . 5 ) The choice c = (cid:67) ( h ) , i . e . , (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ) = h , then leads to a consistent set of solutions with increasing depth h ( creep ) and increasing contact ra - dius because ˙ (cid:36) > 0 and the relation between (cid:36) and depth h is (cid:36) ( t ) = 4 (cid:70) ( h ( t ) ) / p 0 . As (cid:36) ( t ) also approaches a constant value if t → ∞ the same applies to the depth and (cid:36) ( ∞ ) = 4 (cid:70) ( h ( ∞ ) ) / p 0 3 . 2 . A monotonically decreasing contact radius In the instance of a monotonically decreasing contact radius ( Fig . 3 . 1 ) one has c ( τ ) > c ( t ) and , consequently , L (cid:48) ( c ( t ) , τ ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) for 0 < τ < t , 16 3 . CLOSED FORM SOLUTIONS again for arbitrary time t . So , substitution of r = c ( t ) in the ﬁrst of ( 2 . 23 ) gives now ( 3 . 6 ) (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) ω ( t ) = h ∗ d ω ⇒ c ( t ) = (cid:67) (cid:181) [ h ∗ d φ ] ( t ) φ ( t ) (cid:182) , i . e . , the contact radius depends not only on the indenter shape and the depth but also on the reduced relaxation function φ . Because also [ L ∗ d ω ] ( r , t ) | r = c ( t ) = (cid:76) ( c ( t ) ) ω ( t ) , the load formula ( 2 . 24a ) now takes the form ( 3 . 7 ) p ( t ) = 4 ω ( t ) { c ( t ) (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) − (cid:76) ( c ( t ) ) } ⇒ p ( t ) = 4 ω ( t ) (cid:70) (cid:181) [ h ∗ d φ ] ( t ) φ ( t ) (cid:182) . For a cone p ∝ ω { [ h ∗ d φ ] / φ } 2 and for a parabole p ∝ ω { [ h ∗ d φ ] / φ } 3 / 2 ( see Appendix B ) . The formulae ( 3 . 7 ) are completely different from those of the previous case and the main reason is that the contact radius no longer depends solely on the indentation depth and the indenter type but also on the material behaviour , i . e . , the reduced stress relax - ation function φ . The relation between the load , the contact radius and the material behaviour – the ﬁrst of ( 3 . 7 ) – is now mathematically the same as for purely elastic materials but the relation between the experimental data – the second of ( 3 . 7 ) – and the material behaviour is completely different . Mathematically , the latter formula is a nonlinear integral equation . It is generally difﬁcult to determine whether the contact is receding or not only on the basis of the experimental data h and p . Differen - tiation of the ﬁrst of ( 3 . 6 ) to time shows that the contact radius is re - ceding for t > 0 if [ h ∗ d φ ] / φ is a decreasing function in this time period because ˙ c (cid:76) (cid:48)(cid:48) ( c ) = d { [ h ∗ d φ ] / φ } / d t and (cid:76) (cid:48)(cid:48) ( c ) > 0 . After some elementary calculations one ﬁnds ( 3 . 8 ) ˙ c = 1 (cid:76) (cid:48)(cid:48) ( c ) (cid:110) ˙ h 0 − 1 φ 2 ( t ) (cid:90) t 0 (cid:169) ˙ h ( τ ) ˙ φ ( t ) φ ( t − τ ) − ¨ h ( τ ) φ ( t ) φ ( t − τ ) (cid:170) d τ (cid:111) and in the limit t ↓ 0 ˙ c 0 = ˙ h 0 / (cid:76) (cid:48)(cid:48) ( c 0 ) results . As expected , an initial negative value for the indenter speed is a necessary condition for a strictly receding contact radius . For other times the sign of ˙ c depends also on the rest of the term within brackets in ( 3 . 8 ) . Considering that φ is a reduced stress relaxation function and the material has fading memory , i . e . , φ > 0 and ˙ φ < 0 , it follows that the conditions ˙ h < 0 and ¨ h < 0 are sufﬁcient for receding contact . The rate of change of the load is ˙ p = 4 { ˙ φ p / φ + ˙ c ω c (cid:76) (cid:48)(cid:48) ( c ) } . As ˙ φ and ˙ c are negative while p / φ and ω c (cid:76) (cid:48)(cid:48) ( c ) are positive , a receding contact is accompanied by a decreasing load but it is not so that a decreasing load always indicates a receding contact as the phenomenon of a ’nose’ demonstrates . 3 . 3 . INCREASING AND DECREASING CONTACT RADIUS 17 3 . 3 . Increasing and decreasing contact radius The solutions from the two previous subsections are valid along the whole time axis . Instead of monotonically increasing or decreasing contact regions it is still possible to have c ( τ ) < c ( t ) or c ( τ ) > c ( t ) for 0 < τ < t except that these inequalities are not always valid but only for the current time values in certain time intervals . For example , for time c 0 radius c ( t ) radius time c ( t ) c ( T ) T T c ( T ) Figure 3 . 2 . Varying but globally increasing ( left ) or decreasing contact radius ( right ) ; c ( τ ) < c ( t ) or c ( τ ) > c ( t ) for 0 < τ < t only valid for times t , in the non - greyed regions . those times in the non - grayed intervals , e . g . time T in Figs . 3 . 2 ( left ) or 3 . 2 ( right ) the results ( 3 . 1 ) or ( 3 . 6 ) apply but for other times , i . e . , those located in the grayed time ranges in Fig . 3 . 2 they do not . Of special interest is the varying but globally increasing contact radius because for every time value in the non - grayed intervals is the contact radius slaved only to the current depth , e . g . at time T ( Fig . 3 . 2 , left ) is c ( T ) = (cid:67) ( h ( T ) ; during these time periods , the contact radius is linked to experimental data for h ( t ) in just the same way as for purely elastic materials . Essential is the answer to the question whether a line of constant radius to a particular point , say ( t , r ) = ( T , c ( T ) ) , on the c ( t ) versus t curve intersected this curve at an earlier time or not . If not , either c ( τ ) < c ( T ) for 0 < τ < T in which case the theory of Chap . 3 . 1 applies at time T or c ( τ ) > c ( T ) for 0 < τ < T is valid and the theory of Chap . 3 . 2 can be used . The analysis becomes much more complicated if an in - tersection occurred at an earlier time and this might happen happens when the dynamical variant of the experiment is performed . Although in this case a monotonic contact radius might prevail , the classic anal - ysis of dynamic load - depth sensing has serious limitations which are treated in more detail in Chap . 3 . 4 . In dynamic load - depth sensing the control variable varies periodically or a periodic perturbation is super - posed on it . The upshot is that a point on the surface might move many times in and out of the contact region and the type of the appropriate boundary condition at these points also changes many times . Analysis of these cases might be better performed via the decomposition method of Golden and Graham [ 39 , p . 63 – 69 ] . More details follow later in the Chapters 4 , 5 and 6 . 18 3 . CLOSED FORM SOLUTIONS 3 . 4 . Classic dynamic load depth sensing During dynamic load depth sensing a small periodic perturbation is superposed on the global indenter motion and the idea is to obtain the frequency dependent transfer function linking input perturbation and the resulting effect on output variable . As the method is inher - ently dynamic , elastic stiffness , damping properties of the equipment and inertial effects play an import role and need to be incorporated in the analysis ( see , e . g . , [ 56 ] ; [ 34 , p . 126 – 131 ] ) . However , as the cen - tre of attention is here the response of the substrate – as governed by the equations ( 2 . 17 ) and ( 2 . 21 ) or ( 2 . 23 ) and ( 2 . 24 ) – the inﬂuences of the equipment properties ( stiffness , damping , mass ) are not taken into account . 3 . 4 . 1 . Basic setup . The goal is to determine the frequency depen - dent storage and loss moduli of the material by measuring the ampli - tude and phase shift of sinusoidal response to a sinusoidal perturba - tion of the global control variable ( depth or load ) . Experimentally , the choice of the global control variable – also called carrier variable [ 59 ] or main variable [ 62 , p . 81 ] – is very important for a number of reasons . Firstly , the size of the total input variable must be such that never contact is lost during the experiment and loss of contact is signalled by a vanishing of the load . Secondly , in the classic approach one works basically with the analytical formula valid for monotonically increas - ing contact radius , i . e . , with load - depth relation : [ p ∗ d (cid:36) ] ( t ) = 4 (cid:70) ( h ( t ) ) , but then – necessarily – the experimental setup must be such that the contact radius indeed increases monotonically 3 . The pertinent depth - contact radius connection is h ( t ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) and also ˙ h ( t ) = (cid:76) (cid:48)(cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) ˙ c ( t ) ; monotonically increasing ( non - decreasing ) depth is a necessary condi - tion for monotonically increasing ( non - decreasing ) contact . Thirdly , as the total response contains three effects , namely a transient part , a part due to the carrier input and a part due to the superposed pertur - bation the latter part must be extracted from the raw data . 3 . 4 . 2 . Limitations . One way to ensure contact is to choose a step as ( global ) input variable with size much larger than the amplitude of the perturbation . The advantage of a step as global control vari - able is that in both cases – load or depth control – the part of the contact radius associated with the carrier step is either constant ( see Chap . 3 . 1 . 1 ) or increasing ( see Chap . 3 . 1 . 2 ) and that asymptotically , i . e . , for large time , the part of all responses associated with the carrier variable becomes constant thus facilitating the separation of the per - turbational part of the response from the carrier part . Unfortunately , 3 See the studies by Huang et al . [ 59 ] for a spherical indenter and Cheng et al . [ 25 ] for a conical and spherical indenter ; in both papers the ratio λ ( t ) / µ ( t ) was considered constant . Knaus et al . [ 62 , p . 82 ] also discussed this problem . 3 . 4 . CLASSIC DYNAMIC LOAD DEPTH SENSING 19 the behaviour of the total contact radius might be quite different from that associated with the carrier part . If the experiment is driven in depth control with , e . g . h ( t ) = h g { 1 + (cid:178) sin ( Ω t ) } H ( t ) with h g the carrier step size and (cid:178) (cid:191) 1 the relative amplitude of the perturbation , the in - denter speed , ˙ h ( t ) = (cid:178) Ω h g cos Ω t , changes periodically of sign and it fol - lows that for this type of control the load - depth relation p ∗ d (cid:36) = 4 (cid:70) ( h ) is at best – for very small (cid:178) – only approximately true . Alternatively , for load control with p ( t ) = p g { 1 + (cid:178) sin Ω t } H ( t ) one ﬁnds asymptotically ( 3 . 9 ) [ p ∗ d (cid:36) ] ( t ) ∼ p g (cid:36) ( ∞ ) + (cid:178) p g (cid:161) (cid:98) (cid:36) st ( Ω ) sin Ω t + (cid:98) (cid:36) lo ( Ω ) cos Ω t (cid:162) The frequency dependent functions (cid:98) (cid:36) st ( Ω ) and (cid:98) (cid:36) lo ( Ω ) are the storage and loss modulus associated with the creep function (cid:36) , i . e . , the com - plex modulus (cid:98) (cid:36) st ( Ω ) + i (cid:98) (cid:36) lo ( Ω ) is the Fourier transform of i Ω (cid:36) ( t ) . In view of the assumed load - depth relation , p ∗ d (cid:36) = 4 (cid:70) ( h ) , the factor 4 (cid:70) ( h ) should asymptotically also behave like ( 3 . 9 ) , i . e . , vary sinusoidally , and this again implies that the depth rate changes sign . Therefore , the con - clusion is that also for this type of load control the load - depth relation p ∗ d (cid:36) = 4 (cid:70) ( h ) is at best – for very small (cid:178) – only approximately true . time t d e p t h h ( t ) h ( t ) = t + sin ( t ) / 2 h ( t ) = t + sin ( t ) h ( t ) = t + 2sin ( t ) h ( t ) = t + 2sin ( t ) Figure 3 . 3 . Depth control with sinusoidally perturbed ramp shaped carrier depth . Solid and dashed line : h ( t ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) everywhere . Dotted line : depth h ( t ) = t + 2sin t ; h ( t ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) ( thin dot data points ) or h ( t ) (cid:54) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) ( thick dot data points ) . To circumvent the problems signalled in the previous paragraph Huang et al . [ 59 ] and Knaus et al . [ 62 , p . 83 ] suggested to use a ramp type function as carrier variable but the disadvantage of this approach is that separating the perturbational part from the carrier response is much more difﬁcult . Additionally , this limits the ramp speed , fre - quency and perturbation amplitude that can be used . For example , using for depth control the function h ( t ) = vt + h 1 sin Ω t , the indenter speed ˙ h is only positive – a necessary condition for an increasing con - tact – as long as Ω h 1 / v ≤ 1 ( see Fig . 3 . 3 ) . Otherwise , i . e . , Ω h 1 / v > 1 , the relation h ( t ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) is only valid in certain time periods whereas in others h ( t ) is not equal to (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) , though the deviation might be small if Ω h 1 / v differs only slightly from the value 1 . 20 3 . CLOSED FORM SOLUTIONS 3 . 5 . Occurrence of a ’nose’ in the load versus depth curve A monotonic increasing contact radius is always accompanied by an increasing depth because ˙ h = ˙ c (cid:76) (cid:48)(cid:48) ( c ) with (cid:76) (cid:48)(cid:48) ( c ) > 0 . So , for a con - tact , initially increasing , the depth is also increasing , at least up to the moment that ˙ c becomes zero for the ﬁrst time or jumps to a nega - tive value when the contact radius has a kinked maximum . However , the load might have reached its maximum earlier as the ( possible ) ap - pearance of a ’nose’ demonstrates ( Fig . 1 . 1b and Fig . 1 . 1c ) . Typical of a nose is that the load decreases whereas the depth and contact radius still increase . Differentiation of the ﬁrst of ( 3 . 3 ) to time gives ( 3 . 10 ) (cid:36) 0 ˙ p ( t ) + ˙ (cid:36) ( t ) p 0 + (cid:90) t 0 ˙ p ( τ ) ˙ (cid:36) ( t − τ ) d τ = 4 c ( t ) ˙ h ( t ) 0 < t < t m . Because c ( t ) > 0 , (cid:36) 0 > 0 , p 0 ≥ 0 , ˙ (cid:36) ( t ) > 0 , ˙ p ( t ) > 0 for 0 < t < t 1 , the integrand , ˙ p ( τ ) ˙ (cid:36) ( t − τ ) , in ( 3 . 10 ) is non - negative for 0 < τ < t < t 1 . Therefore , the left - hand side of this equation is positive in the interval 0 < t < t 1 and it follows that the right - hand side is also positive in this time range for any t 1 < t m . If the load - depth curve is smooth ( Fig . 1 . 1b ) with ˙ p = 0 at t = t 1 , the right - hand side of ( 3 . 10 ) remains positive for some time afterwards and so does the left - hand side ; ˙ h ( t 1 ) > 0 because c ( t 1 ) > 0 . Therefore , the depth reaches a maximum at a later time and a ’nose’ is always present . This is as expected for thermodynamic reasons because the substrate material is dissipative . If the load - depth curve is kinked at the load maximum ( Fig . 1 . 1c ) , a ’nose’ might or might not be present . Just after the kink , i . e . , at t = t 1 + 0 , the rate ˙ p ( t 1 + 0 ) is negative and ( 3 . 10 ) shows that ˙ h ( t 1 + 0 ) > 0 ( presence of a ’nose’ ) whenever ( 3 . 11 ) ˙ (cid:36) ( t 1 + 0 ) p 0 + (cid:90) t 1 0 ˙ p ( τ ) ˙ (cid:36) ( t 1 − τ ) d τ > − (cid:36) 0 ˙ p ( t 1 + 0 ) > 0 . So , unloading sufﬁciently slow , i . e . , decreasing the term − (cid:36) 0 ˙ p ( t 1 + 0 ) in ( 3 . 11 ) , leads to a nose thus corroborating the numerical results of Cheng and Cheng [ 18 ] . Reducing the left - hand side of this inequality is possible by introducing a hold period , i . e . , a period with ˙ p = 0 prior to the start of unloading at t 1 . If this period is sufﬁciently long the inequality ( 3 . 11 ) is no longer met and ˙ h ( t 1 + 0 ) < 0 ; the ’nose’ disappears as found experimentally [ 11 , 29 ] . 3 . 6 . The initial elastic response In Chap . 2 . 7 . 3 it was argued that the determination of the mate - rial function ω ( t ) better be split in two steps the ﬁrst of which is the determination of the elasticity factor ω 0 . Theoretically this ﬁrst phase 3 . 7 . THE ELASTIC RESPONSE TO JUMPS IN THE LOAD AND DEPTH RATES 21 is straightforward ; only an initial step in the control variable and tak - ing the limit t ↓ 0 of the response is needed to generate all necessary information because initially p 0 = 4 ω 0 (cid:70) ( h 0 ) . However , an ideal step in the control variable is difﬁcult to achieve experimentally and in real - ity a step normally consists of a ramp followed by a constant value in which case the limit t ↓ 0 does not make sense . Although in principle this method is one whereby the contact radius is increasing during the ramping and the theory of Chap . 3 . 1 applies , it is not a proper method to determine the initial elastic response . 3 . 7 . The elastic response to jumps in the load and depth rates An alternative way to determine the elasticity factor ω 0 is to look at the response to rate jumps as mentioned previously in Chap . 1 . 1 . Macroscopically , the depth h ( t ) or the load p ( t ) control the inden - tation process and – apart from a possible jump at time zero – these two variables are continuous functions for t > 0 and this also applies to the resulting functions , contact radius c ( t ) and strain u (cid:48) ( r , t ) . However , as sharp transitions from loading to unloading , a sudden introduction or ending of a hold period may cause kinks in the time dependence of load and depth curve the time derivative of depth and load may well be only piecewise continuous ; the rates ˙ h and / or ˙ p exhibit jumps at cer - tain times , say at time T and rate jumps 〈 ˙ h 〉 T and / or 〈 ˙ p 〉 T are nonzero . The sets of basic equations ( 2 . 23 ) and ( 2 . 24 ) still apply for all time , but time derivatives may not exist at T , i . e . , the time derivatives might have jumps here too . In Appendix C formulae are derived for the rate jumps in h , c , and p and they are recapitulated here ( see ( C . 10 ) and ( C . 11 ) ) ( 3 . 12 ) ω 0 〈 ˙ h 〉 T 〈 ˙ c 〉 T = π 2 θ (cid:48) ( c ( T ) , T ) , 〈 ˙ p 〉 T 〈 ˙ h 〉 T = 4 ω 0 c ( T ) . These rate jumps are determined inside the contact region up to the edge , i . e . , for r ≤ c ( T ) . The presence of the quantity θ (cid:48) in the results enables the deter - mination of the signs of the rate jumps . Near the contact radius , but inside the contact zone , i . e . , at r = ( 1 − δ ) c ( with c = c ( t ) and δ a small but positive number ) , the stress formula ( 2 . 11 ) gives ( 3 . 13 ) σ ( c ( 1 − δ ) , t ) = − θ (cid:48) ( c , t ) (cid:112) 2 δ (cid:169) 1 + O ( δ ) (cid:170) . As the normal stress σ is compressive , i . e . , of negative sign , θ (cid:48) ( c ( t ) , t ) is always non - negative . In addition , c and ω 0 are also positive , so ( 3 . 14 ) sign 〈 ˙ p T 〉 = sign 〈 ˙ h T 〉 = sign 〈 ˙ c T 〉 . All these results lead to the conclusion that jumps in the loading rate ˙ p , the indentation rate ˙ h and the rate of change ˙ c of the contact radius always occur simultaneously and are of equal sign . 22 3 . CLOSED FORM SOLUTIONS The second of ( 3 . 12 ) shows that the response to jumps in the rates is elastic and this corroborates earlier results of Ngan et al . [ 77 ] , de With [ 30 , p . 609 – 610 ] , Ngan and Tang [ 75 ] and Tang and Ngan [ 100 ] . It parallels the equation S = 4 ω E c for the contact stiffness for elastic materials with 〈 ˙ p 〉 T / 〈 ˙ h 〉 T functioning as the contact stiffness . The response to jumps in the rates is always elastic ; it is imma - terial at which point of the load - depth curve the rate jumps occur , it is immaterial whether a nose is present afterwards or not and it is even immaterial whether the load - depth curve kinks upwards or not . However , the contact radius c ( T ) appearing in the equation might be dependent on the reduced relaxation function φ ( see Chap . 3 . 2 & 3 . 3 ) . So , the practical use of this equation is limited to the situation where the contact radius is independent of the material properties , i . e . , to those situations where the contact radius at the jump time exceeds all previous values because only in these cases c ( T ) = (cid:67) ( h ( T ) ) ( Fig . 3 . 1a , Fig . 3 . 1c and Chap . 3 . 1 ) . The rate jump ratio can be determined di - rectly from measured rates [ 75 ] or indirectly , e . g . by applying a correc - tion to the unload stiffness after a speciﬁc load schedule [ 33 , 77 , 101 ] or by a sufﬁciently fast unload in which case the rate jump ratio equals approximately the unload stiffness [ 19 , 20 , 24 ] . 3 . 7 . 1 . Intermezzo : the inﬂuence of plastic deformation . 3 . 7 . 1 . 1 . The theory of the effective indenter . In practice , an addi - tional complication arises because plastic deformation , however slight , is always present and this phenomenon obscures the relation between contact radius and depth . During the ﬁrst loading the geometry of substrate changes from a ﬂat surface – an assumption on which the theory is based – to one having a permanent impression . The com - plication caused by plasticity also occurs when elastic materials are indented . In this case , this problem is solved by using only data of the unload curve – possibly after load cycling a number of times , i . e . , preconditioning the substrate – because along this curve only elastic properties are probed ( Fig . 3 . 4a ) . The slope S m of the tangent at the start of the unload curve still equals 4 ω E c m [ 15 ] but the value of c m must be estimated in a different way , that is to say different as com - pared to the purely elastic case . To do so , several methods have been derived in the past ( see , e . g . , [ 34 , Chapter 3 ] ) but modern methods are based on the idea of the ’effective indenter’ [ 9 , 78 , 79 , 83 , 112 ] . The geometry change is shifted from the substrate to the indenter because the ’effective indenter’ is considered to be pressed into a ﬂat , purely elastic substrate ; the basic idea is graphically elucidated in Fig . 3 . 4 . The shape proﬁle of the ’effective indenter’ is assumed to be such that the load - depth curve of the ’effective indenter’ matches the experimental 3 . 7 .

Variables pertaining to the ’effective’ conﬁguration are supplied with the subscript ’e’ . data of the actual unload curve ( Fig . 3 . 4f ) . At full load 4 , i . e . , at p e = p m , S e = S m and therefore c e = c m . Two additional assumptions are vital ; ﬁrstly , the displacements at the edge of the contact regions are the same when the contact radii are the same , i . e u e ( c m ) = u ( c m ) , and , sec - ondly , the ’effective indenter’ shape is a power law as this implies that u e ( c ) ∝ − p e / S e . The upshot of all this is that at full load : ( 3 . 15 ) h c = h m + u ( c m ) = h m − ε p m / S m in which ε is an indenter speciﬁc constant and the contact radius is now determined using the area function mentioned in Chap . 1 . 1 . 3 . 7 . 1 . 2 . Correcting for plasticity effects . To evaluate , experimen - tally , the initial elastic response of polypropylene and amorphous sele - nium and , numerically , the accuracy of the estimated contact radius of a power law creeping material , Tang and Ngan [ 101 ] , Ngan et al . [ 77 ] , Ngan and Tang [ 75 ] used the same procedure by substituting their creep corrected contact stiffness – effectively equal to the rate jump ratio because of the applied load schedule – for the slope in ( 3 . 15 ) , i . e . , they used ( 3 . 16 ) h c ( T ) = h ( T ) − ε p ( T ) 〈 ˙ h 〉 T / 〈 ˙ p 〉 T to approximate the contact depth . The validity of this formula is analysed in Appendix D by applica - tion of the ’effective indenter’ idea to viscoelastic materials , using the same assumptions as for the elastic case and and considering a situ - ation where the contact radius increases up to the jump time T and exceeds there all previous values . It is shown that , instead of ( 3 . 16 ) , 4 Variables pertaining to the effective conﬁguration are supplied with the sub - script ’e’ 24 3 . CLOSED FORM SOLUTIONS the ﬁnal result , equation ( D . 6 ) , is found to be ( 3 . 17 ) h c ( T ) = h ( T ) − ε p ( T ) 〈 ˙ h 〉 T 〈 ˙ p 〉 T R ( T ) . The factor R ( see ( D . 7 ) ) is ( 3 . 18 ) R ( T ) = 1 + (cid:90) T 0 p ( τ ) p ( T ) ˙ ϕ ( T − τ ) d τ and for elastic materials R ( T ) is always 1 . For viscoelastic materials R depends on the load history prior to T and the reduced creep function ϕ . For the considered load schedule , i . e . , p starting from zero and monotonically increasing up to T one ﬁnds – on account of the second mean value theorem 5 for integrals [ 41 , p . 1095 ] – that R ( T ) = ϕ ( ξ ( T ) ) with 0 < ξ ( T ) < T , so 1 < R ( T ) < ϕ ( T ) . 5 In literature also known as the third mean value theorem [ 98 , p . 236 – 237 ] or the Weierstrass form of Bonnet’s theorem [ 109 , p . 138 ] CHAPTER 4 Decomposing the hereditary integrals in the indentation equations 4 . 1 . General part In the normal experimental situation an indentation experiment starts at zero contact radius and ends at zero contact radius . In the mean time the contact radius increases and decreases only once or a few times – conventional load - depth sensing – or , alternatively , a large number of times as is the case in the dynamic variant of the experi - ment ; a point at the substrate surface might move many times in and out the contact region . If this point is currently located in the con - tact region one knows the normal displacement here because in the contact region the surface conforms to the indenter ; locally a displace - ment boundary condition applies at this point in time . If , perhaps some time later or earlier , the same surface location is part of the free surface , the stress must be zero here and a stress boundary condition is now valid . Consider the basic equations ( 2 . 17 ) and ( 2 . 21 ) at a ﬁxed value of r , i . e . , along a line of constant radius ( Fig . 4 . 1 ) , say r = R . To simplify the notation , these formulae are divided by ω 0 and the following variables are deﬁned ( 4 . 1 ) ρ c ( r , t ) = πϑ c ( r , t ) 2 ω 0 , (cid:96) ( t ) = p ( t ) ω 0 , q c ( r , t ) = ℘ c ( r , t ) ω 0 , L ( r , t ) = L ( r , t ) − rh ( t ) . The expressions ( 2 . 17 ) and ( 2 . 21 ) now take the form (cid:37) c ( R , t ) = [ L (cid:48) ∗ d φ ] ( R , t ) convolution (cid:28) L (cid:48) ( R , t ) = [ (cid:37) c ∗ d ϕ ] ( R , t ) , ( 4 . 2 ) q c ( R , t ) = 4 [ L ∗ d φ ] ( R , t ) convolution (cid:28) 4 L ( R , t ) = [ q c ∗ d ϕ ] ( R , t ) . ( 4 . 3 ) Viewed along a line of constant r these equations can be envisaged as two different examples of a single mathematical problem , namely the determination of two time - dependent functions 1 a ( t ) and b ( t ) , related by a ( t ) = [ b ∗ d φ ] ( t ) and b ( t ) = [ a ∗ d ϕ ] ( t ) , whereby the time axis consists of a set of disjoint , but abutting , intervals – the grayed and non grayed 1 That in indentation the idea is to determine the material function φ or ϕ is for the moment left out of consideration . 25 26 4 .

During the grayed time intervals (cid:37) c ( R , t ) = 0 and q c ( R , t ) = (cid:96) ( t ) and during the non - grayed ones L (cid:48) ( R , t ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) − h ( t ) and L ( R , t ) = (cid:76) ( R ) − Rh ( t ) . The current time is here located below ’hill’ n . time intervals in Fig . 4 . 1 – where either a ( t ) or b ( t ) is given . For the equations ( 4 . 2 ) a ( t ) = (cid:37) c ( R , t ) and b ( t ) = L (cid:48) ( R , t ) and for the equations ( 4 . 3 ) : a ( t ) = q c ( R , t ) and b ( t ) = 4 L ( R , t ) . The mathematical key feature is that given and unknown func - tions occur intermixed on the time axis . Hence , the integrand in the convolution integral [ a ∗ d φ ] ( t ) is not known on the complete integra - tion range because the integration variable passes through various intervals on which the function a is not known . However , precisely on these intervals is the integrand of the dual equation b ∗ d ϕ deﬁned because b is known here . Alternatively , on all intervals where the in - tegrand of b ∗ d ϕ is not known , is that of a ∗ d φ given . To tackle this problem , Golden and Graham [ 39 , p . 63 – 69 ] decompose the convolu - tion integrals in such a way that every interval where a ( or b ) is not known turns out to be a sum of integrals over intervals with known integrands . How the decomposition technique actually works is ex - plained in E . The governing equations ( 4 . 2 ) and ( 4 . 3 ) are decomposed using this technique . The decomposed equations have the property that the in - termixing of the depth , contact radius and load , present in the original equations eventually disappears ( see Chap . 4 . 5 ) . Later , the results are applied to the case of classic indentation ( Chap . 5 ) , i . e . , simple load - ing and unloading , and to dynamic indentation experiments ( Chap . 6 ) where a sinusoidal perturbation is superposed on a constant control variable ( depth or load ) . 4 . 2 . Viewing the time axis as a sequence of ’hill’ and ’valley’ intervals A traveller , metaphorically moving along the line r = R ( Fig . 4 . 1 ) , passes in the course of time through ”hills’ , i . e . , time intervals for which c ( t ) > R , and over ”valleys” , intervals for which c ( t ) < R . The ’hills’ , are numbered progressively in the positive time direction with 4 . 3 . THE DEPTH EQUATION 27 t 1 , t 2 , . . . , the times of the local maxima in these regions , and the ’val - ley’ directly preceding a ’hills’ is assigned the same number ( Fig . 4 . 1 ) . The current value t of time is always located in the union of some ’val - ley’ and the next ’hill’ interval , say in the union of ’valley’ n and ’hill’ n , and the time τ 0 is – by deﬁnition – the time where ’hill’ n changes into ’valley’ n + 1 . The values of boundary times where the passage from ’valley’ to ’hill’ and vice versa occurs , τ 1 , τ 2 , . . . are again numbered progressively but now in the negative time direction until τ 2 n − 1 , which is basically the ﬁrst actual intersection point . Finally , the sequence is completed by adding τ 2 n and choosing this time equal to zero . Ob - viously , the time values τ j depend on the radius R because – by con - struction c ( τ j ) = R – but the subscript value may also change depend - ing on the value of the current time one considers because this also determines the value of n and the starting point for the τ - numbering . Moving with the current time from ’valley’ n to ’hill’ n does not change the numbering but moving from a ’hill’ n to a ’valley’ n + 1 does . Con - sequently ( 4 . 4a ) τ j ( R , n ) = τ j + 2 ( R , n + 1 ) for j = 0 , 1 , . . . , 2 n − 1 , ( 4 . 4b ) L ( R , τ j ) = (cid:76) ( R ) − Rh ( τ j ) for j = 0 , 1 , . . . , 2 n − 1 , whereas for the subscript value j = 2 n only τ 2 n ( R , n ) = 0 is deﬁned . 4 . 3 . The depth equation 4 . 3 . 1 . Current time in a ’valley’ interval : τ 2 ( R , n ) < t < τ 1 ( R , n ) . For t in ’valley’ interval n , ( E . 13 ) applies for n = 1 and ( E . 14 ) for n ≥ 2 . Take a ( t ) = (cid:37) c ( R , t ) , b ( t ) = L (cid:48) ( R , t ) , τ 2 ( R , 1 ) = 0 in these equations and note that (cid:37) c ( R , s ) = 0 in the ’valley’ intervals and L (cid:48) ( R , s ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) − h ( s ) below the ’hills . The result is ( 4 . 5 ) L (cid:48) ( R , t ) =    0 n = 1 , n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 τ 2 k ( R , n ) (cid:90) τ 2 k + 1 ( R , n ) N 2 k ( t , s , R , n ) (cid:110) (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) − h ( s ) (cid:111) d s n ≥ 2 . The material properties are contained in the functions N j ( see ( E . 15 ) and ( E . 16 ) ) starting with ( 4 . 6 ) N 1 ( t , s , R , n ) = ˙ ϕ ( t − s ) , and proceeding with ( 4 . 7 ) N 2 k ( t , s , R , n ) = N 2 k − 1 ( t , s , R , n ) + τ 2 k ( R , n ) (cid:90) s N 2 k − 1 ( t , u , R , n ) ˙ φ ( u − s ) d u , k ≥ 1 , 28 4 . DECOMPOSING HEREDITARY INTEGRALS plus ( 4 . 8 ) N 2 k + 1 ( t , s , R , n ) = N 2 k ( t , s , R , n ) + τ 2 k + 1 ( R , n ) (cid:90) s N 2 k ( t , u , R , n ) ˙ ϕ ( u − s ) d u , k ≥ 1 . These functions act as kernel for the integral operators V k and W k de - ﬁned by V k ( t , R , n ) = τ 2 k ( R . n ) (cid:90) τ 2 k + 1 ( R , n ) N 2 k ( t , s , R , n ) d s , ( 4 . 9 ) W k ( t , R , n ) = τ 2 k ( R . n ) (cid:90) τ 2 k + 1 ( R , n ) N 2 k ( t , s , R , n ) h ( s ) d s . ( 4 . 10 ) With these deﬁnitions ( 4 . 5 ) becomes ( 4 . 11 ) L (cid:48) ( R , t ) =   0 n = 1 , (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 V k ( t , R , n ) − n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 W k ( t , R , n ) n ≥ 2 . The formulae ( 4 . 11 ) represent a ’decomposed’ version of ( 2 . 17 ) but to ﬁnd the equivalent of ( 2 . 23 ) – the equations relating depth , contact radius and material properties along the curve of the contact radius – the limits t ↑ τ 1 ( R , n ) and t ↓ τ 2 ( R , n ) must be taken because the ﬁxed radius R equals the contact radius at these times . The limit t ↑ τ 1 ( R , n ) , the end of a ’valley’ , yields for n = 1 ( 4 . 12 ) (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) = h ( τ 1 ) ) , τ 1 = τ 1 ( R , 1 ) , and for n ≥ 2 ( 4 . 13 ) (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 − n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 V k ( τ 1 , R , n ) (cid:33) = h ( τ 1 ) − n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 W k ( τ 1 , R , n ) , τ 1 = τ 1 ( R , n ) . Since R = c ( τ 1 ( R , 1 ) ) , the limit for n = 1 can also be written as ( 4 . 14 ) h ( τ 1 ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( τ 1 ) ) , τ 1 = τ 1 ( R , 1 ) . This expression is identical to ( 3 . 1 ) , the result found earlier for an increasing contact radius . The limit t ↓ τ 2 ( R , n ) , the start of a ’valley’ , only makes sense for n ≥ 2 because τ 2 ( R , 1 ) is always zero , whatever the value of R might 4 . 3 . THE DEPTH EQUATION 29 be .

Current time in a ’hill’ interval : τ 1 ( R , n ) < t < τ 0 ( R , n ) . For t below ’hill’ n , application of ( E . 9 ) with a ( t ) = (cid:37) c ( R , t ) and b ( t ) = L (cid:48) ( R , t ) to ( 4 . 2 ) , with (cid:37) c ( R , s ) = 0 above a ’valley’ and L (cid:48) ( R , s ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) − h ( s ) below a ’hill’ , shows that for τ 1 ( R , n ) < t < τ 0 ( R , n ) and n = 1 ( 4 . 16 ) (cid:37) c ( R , t ) = L (cid:48) ( R , t ) + t (cid:90) τ 1 ( R , 1 ) T 0 ( t , s ) L (cid:48) ( R , s ) d s , and , if n ≥ 2 , ( 4 . 17 ) (cid:37) c ( R , t ) = L (cid:48) ( R , t ) + t (cid:90) τ 1 ( R , n ) T 0 ( t , s ) L (cid:48) ( R , s ) d s + n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 τ 2 k ( R , n ) (cid:90) τ 2 k + 1 ( R , n ) T 2 k ( t , s , R , n ) L (cid:48) ( R , s ) d s . The material properties now enter the analysis through the T j func - tions ( see ( E . 11 ) and ( E . 10 ) ) , starting with ( 4 . 18 ) T 0 ( t , s , R , n ) = ˙ φ ( t − s ) , and proceeding with ( 4 . 19 ) T 2 k + 1 ( t , s , R , n ) = T 2 k ( t , s , n ) + τ 2 k + 1 ( R , n ) (cid:90) s T 2 k ( t , u , R , n ) ˙ ϕ ( u − s ) d u k = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . , plus ( 4 . 20 ) T 2 k ( t , s , R , n ) = T 2 k − 1 ( t , s , R , n ) + τ 2 k ( R , n ) (cid:90) s T 2 k − 1 ( t , u , R , n ) ˙ φ ( u − s ) d u k = 1 , 2 , . . . 30 4 .

The equations ( 4 . 23 ) to ( 4 . 26 ) represent the ’decomposed’ equivalent of the equations ( 2 . 23a ) and ( 2 . 23b ) relating depth , contact radius and material properties along the curve of the contact radius . 4 . 4 . The load equation For the application of the decomposition technique to the load equa - tion ( 4 . 3 ) , the choice for the functions a and b from Appendix E is : a ( t ) = q c ( R , t ) and b ( t ) = 4 L ( R , t ) . The procedure now is basically the same as in the previous section , so explanatory remarks will be kept to a minimum . 4 . 4 . 1 . Current time in a ’valley’ interval : τ 2 ( R , n ) < t < τ 1 ( R , n ) . Substitution of a ( s ) = q c ( R , s ) and b ( s ) = 4 L ( R , s ) in ( E . 13 ) and ( E . 14 ) 4 . 4 . THE LOAD EQUATION 31 and noting that in all ’valley’ intervals q c ( R , s ) = − (cid:96) ( s ) yields expres - sions for 4 L ( R , t ) . For n = 1 it is found that ( 4 . 27 ) 4 L ( R , t ) = − (cid:96) ( t ) − t (cid:90) 0 N 1 ( t , s , R , 1 ) (cid:96) ( s ) d s n = 1 , and for larger values of n that ( 4 . 28 ) 4 L ( R , t ) = − (cid:96) ( t ) − t (cid:90) τ 2 ( R , n ) N 1 ( t , s , R , n ) (cid:96) ( s ) d s + 4 n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 τ 2 k ( R , n ) (cid:90) τ 2 k + 1 ( R , n ) N 2 k ( t , s , R , n ) L ( R , s ) d s − n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 τ 2 k + 1 ( R , n ) (cid:90) τ 2 k + 2 ( R , n ) N 2 k + 1 ( t , s , n ) (cid:96) ( s ) d s , n ≥ 2 . Deﬁne ( 4 . 29 ) Q k ( t , R , n ) = τ 2 k + 1 ( R , n ) (cid:90) τ 2 k + 2 ( R , n ) (cid:96) ( s ) N 2 k + 1 ( t , s , R , n ) d s , and note that for the integrals over the ’hill’ intervals L ( R , s ) = (cid:76) ( R ) − Rh ( s ) . The limit t ↑ τ 1 ( R , n ) of ( 4 . 27 ) and ( 4 . 28 ) then leads for n = 1 to ( 4 . 30 ) (cid:96) ( τ 1 ) + Q 0 ( τ 1 , R , 1 ) = 4 { Rh ( τ 1 ) − (cid:76) ( R ) } , τ 1 = τ 1 ( R , 1 ) , and for larger values of n to ( 4 . 31 ) (cid:96) ( τ 1 ) + n − 1 (cid:88) k = 0 Q k ( τ 1 , R , n ) = 4 R (cid:40) h ( τ 1 ) − n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 W k ( τ 1 , R , n ) (cid:41) − 4 (cid:76) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 − n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 V k ( τ 1 , R , n ) (cid:33) , τ 1 = τ 1 ( R , n ) , n ≥ 2 . As expected , the result for n = 1 , i . e . , equation ( 4 . 30 ) supplied with R = c ( τ 1 ) , equals the load equation ( 3 . 2 ) for increasing contact . As before , the limit t ↓ τ 2 ( R , n ) only makes sense for n ≥ 2 and this results in ( 4 . 32 ) (cid:96) ( τ 2 ) + n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 Q k ( τ 2 , R , n ) = 4 R (cid:195) h ( τ 2 ) − n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 W k ( τ 2 , R , n ) (cid:33) − 4 (cid:76) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 − n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 V k ( τ 2 , R , n ) (cid:33) , τ 2 = τ 2 ( R , n ) . 32 4 .

Substitution of a ( t ) = q c ( R , t ) and b ( t ) = 4 L ( R , t ) in ( E . 7 ) and ( E . 9 ) results for n = 1 in ( 4 . 33 ) q c ( R , t ) = 4 L ( R , t ) + t (cid:90) τ 1 ( R , 1 ) 4 T 0 ( t , s , R , 1 ) L ( R , s ) d s − τ 1 ( R , 1 ) (cid:90) 0 T 1 ( t , s , R , 1 ) (cid:96) ( s ) d s and for n ≥ 2 in ( 4 . 34 ) q c ( R , t ) = 4 L ( R , t ) + t (cid:90) τ 1 ( R , n ) 4 T 0 ( t , s , R , n ) L ( R , s ) d s − n (cid:88) k = 1 τ 2 k − 1 ( R , n ) (cid:90) τ 2 k ( R , n ) T 2 k − 1 ( t , s , R , n ) (cid:96) ( s ) d s + n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 τ 2 k ( R , n ) (cid:90) τ 2 k + 1 ( R , n ) 4 T 2 k ( t , s , R , n ) L ( R , s ) d s Deﬁne ( 4 . 35 ) P k ( t , R , n ) = τ 2 k − 1 ( R , n ) (cid:90) τ 2 k ( R , n ) (cid:96) ( s ) T 2 k − 1 ( t , s , R , n ) d s , and take again the limits t ↑ τ 0 and t ↓ τ 1 . At τ 0 the result is ( 4 . 36 ) (cid:96) ( τ 0 ) − P 1 ( τ 0 , R , 1 ) = 4 R (cid:110) h ( τ 0 ) + H 0 ( τ 0 , R , 1 ) (cid:111) − 4 (cid:76) ( R ) (cid:110) 1 + U 0 ( τ 0 , R , 1 ) (cid:111) , τ 0 = τ 0 ( R , 1 ) , n = 1 , ( 4 . 37 ) (cid:96) ( τ 0 ) − n (cid:88) k = 1 P k ( τ 0 , R , n ) = 4 R (cid:195) h ( τ 0 ) + n − 1 (cid:88) k = 0 H k ( τ 0 , R , n ) (cid:33) − 4 (cid:76) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 + n − 1 (cid:88) k = 0 U k ( τ 0 , R , n ) (cid:33) , τ 0 = τ 0 ( R , n ) , n ≥ 2 , and at τ 1 ( 4 . 38 ) (cid:96) ( τ 1 ) − P 1 ( τ 1 , R , 1 ) = 4 (cid:169) Rh ( τ 1 ) − (cid:76) ( R ) (cid:170) , τ 1 = τ 1 ( R , 1 ) , n = 1 , 4 . 5 . ELIMINATING THE DEPTH FROM THE LOAD EQUATIONS 33 ( 4 . 39 ) (cid:96) ( τ 1 ) − n (cid:88) k = 1 P k ( τ 1 , R , n ) = 4 R (cid:195) h ( τ 1 ) + n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 H k ( τ 1 , R , n ) (cid:33) − 4 (cid:76) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 + n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 U k ( τ 1 , R , n ) (cid:33) , τ 1 = τ 1 ( R , n ) , n ≥ 2 . 4 . 5 . Eliminating the depth from the load equations In the right - hand sides of the load equations ( 4 . 31 ) and ( 4 . 32 ) for the ’valleys’ and ( 4 . 37 ) plus ( 4 . 39 ) for the ’hills’ the terms dependent on the depth can be eliminated using the corresponding equations linking depth and contact radius . For example , for time τ 1 ( R , n ) in ’valley’ n multiplying ( 4 . 13 ) by R shows that ( 4 . 40 ) R (cid:195) h ( τ 1 ) − n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 W k ( τ 1 , R , n ) (cid:33) = R (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 − n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 V k ( τ 1 , R , n ) (cid:33) . Substitution of this result in ( 4 . 31 ) with (cid:71) ( R ) = R (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) − (cid:76) ( R ) ( see ( B . 3 ) ) gives the simpliﬁed version ( 4 . 41 ) (cid:96) ( τ 1 ) + n − 1 (cid:88) k = 0 Q k ( τ 1 , R , n ) = 4 (cid:71) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 − n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 V k ( τ 1 , R , n ) (cid:33) , τ 1 = τ 1 ( R , n ) , n ≥ 2 . Similarly , the other equation ( 4 . 32 ) valid in a ’valley’ and the two ’hill’ - equations ( 4 . 37 ) plus ( 4 . 39 ) simplify to ( 4 . 42 ) (cid:96) ( τ 2 ) + n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 Q k ( τ 2 , R , n ) = 4 (cid:71) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 − n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 V k ( τ 2 , R , n ) (cid:33) , τ 2 = τ 2 ( R , n ) , n ≥ 2 , ( 4 . 43 ) (cid:96) ( τ 0 ) − n (cid:88) k = 1 P k ( τ 0 , R , n ) = 4 (cid:71) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 + n − 1 (cid:88) k = 0 U k ( τ 0 , R , n ) (cid:33) , τ 0 = τ 0 ( R , n ) , n ≥ 2 , ( 4 . 44 ) (cid:96) ( τ 1 ) − n (cid:88) k = 1 P k ( τ 1 , R , n ) = 4 (cid:71) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 + n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 U k ( τ 1 , R , n ) (cid:33) , τ 1 = τ 1 ( R , n ) , n ≥ 2 . 34 4 . DECOMPOSING HEREDITARY INTEGRALS 4 . 6 . Notes on continuity The functions φ and ϕ are each other Stieltjes inverses and it fol - lows from φ ∗ d ϕ = H that the time derivative of φ ∗ d ϕ is zero for t > 0 as ( A . 4 ) shows . From the deﬁnitions of T 1 and N 1 and the transformation rules for the T j and the N j it can then be shown that T j ( τ 1 ( R , n ) , s , R , n ) + N j ( τ 1 ( R , n ) , R , s , n ) = 0 j = 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . , ( 4 . 45 ) T i ( τ 0 ( R , n ) , R , s , n ) + N i + 2 ( τ 0 ( R , n ) , s , R , n + 1 ) = 0 i = 0 , 1 , 3 , . . . ( 4 . 46 ) For i = 0 , ( 4 . 46 ) with τ 0 ( R , n ) = τ 2 ( R , n + 1 ) reveals that ( 4 . 47 ) N 2 ( τ 2 ( R , n + 1 ) , R , s , n + 1 ) = − ˙ φ ( τ 0 ( R , n ) − s ) . The limits to t → τ 1 , always a point at an increasing part of the contact radius , were taken from inside a ’valley’ interval – limit from below – or from inside a ’hill’ interval – limit from above . Property ( 4 . 45 ) en - sures that this yields the same equations , as it should be . The limits to a point at a decreasing part of the contact radius , were also taken from inside a ’valley’ interval – limit from above – or from inside a ’hill’ in - terval – limit from below . However , due to the numbering convention , this is ’valley’ interval number n + 1 ’hill’ interval number n . Since τ 0 ( R , n ) = τ 2 ( R , n + 1 ) , property ( 4 . 46 ) now ensures that these limits also lead to the same equations . 4 . 7 . Dependance of the kernels T j and N j on their arguments The kernel functions T j and N j both transform in the same way and the dependence of these functions on the current time t and the time - like variable s is basically the same for the two function classes – apart from obvious differences with respect to the starting functions T 0 and N 1 . The generic form of the transformation is for j = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . and τ 1 < t < τ 0 T j + 1 ( t , s , R , n ) = T j ( t , s , R , n ) + τ j + 1 (cid:90) s υ ( u − s ) T j ( t , u , R , n ) d u , ( 4 . 48 ) T 0 ( t , s ) = ˙ φ ( t − s ) , and υ ( x ) = (cid:40) ˙ φ ( x ) j = odd , ˙ ϕ ( x ) j = even . ( 4 . 49 ) The notation T j + 1 ( t , s , R , n ) is actually a shorthand notation 2 to ex - press that T j depends also on τ 1 , τ 2 , . . . , τ j + 1 because the value of R and the choice of n – the number of the interval the current time t is actually located in – determines the values of all τ ’s . 2 Not included in the list of arguments , but nonetheless present , is the depen - dence of T j and N j on a set ˜ p of material constants present in the functions ˙ φ and ˙ ϕ , e . g . ˜ p = { q , κ } for material behaviour according to the standard linear solid because ˙ φ ( t ) = − q κ exp ( − κ t ) as is shown in F . 1 . 1 . 4 . 7 . DEPENDANCE OF THE KERNELS T j AND N j ON THEIR ARGUMENTS 35 The purpose of this part of this section is to prove – by induction – that 3 ( 4 . 50 ) T j ( τ 0 , s , R , n ) = T j ( τ 0 − s , τ 1 − s , . . . , τ j − s ; P ( 0 , j ) ) with P ( 0 , j ) a parameter set of differences ∆ ij = τ i − τ j deﬁned by P ( j , j ) = (cid:59) , ( 4 . 51 ) P ( l , j ) = (cid:110) ∆ ik | i ∈ { l , . . . , j − 1 } , k ∈ { l + 1 , . . . j } , i (cid:54) = k (cid:111) , j ≥ l + 1 . ( 4 . 52 ) The statement in ( 4 . 50 ) is true for j = 0 . Suppose that it is true for j > 1 . This means that T j ( τ 0 , s , R , n ) is some function , say g , of the listed arguments and parameters : ( 4 . 53 ) T j ( τ 0 , s , R , n ) = g ( τ 0 − s , τ 1 − s , . . . , τ j − s ; P ( 0 , j ) ) Next , note that the solution of an inhomogeneous partial differential equation in j + 2 independent variables x , y 0 , y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y j of the form ( 4 . 54 ) ∂ F ∂ x − j (cid:88) k = 0 ∂ F ∂ y k = υ ( x ) g ( y 0 , y 1 , . . . , y j ; P ( 0 , j ) ) is some function deﬁned on the j + 2 dimensional space spanned by the variables x , y 0 , y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y j . Additionally , a description of F also contains the set parameters P ( 0 , j ) . Consider the restriction of F to the straight line deﬁned by the parameter representation ( 4 . 55 ) x ( u ) = u − s , y 0 ( u ) = τ 0 − u , . . . , y j ( u ) = τ j − u , and determine the total derivative d F / d u , along this line . It is found that d F d u = ∂ F ∂ x d x ( u ) d u + j (cid:88) k = 0 ∂ F ∂ y k d y k ( u ) d u = υ ( u − s ) g ( τ 0 − u , . . . , τ j − u ; P ( 0 , j ) ) ( 4 . 56 ) because d x ( u ) / d u = 1 and d y k ( u ) / d u = − 1 for all k - values . The inte - grand in ( 4 . 48 ) is apparently the derivative of some function F and integration over u then leads to ( 4 . 57 ) τ j + 1 (cid:90) s υ ( x ( u ) ) g ( y 0 ( u ) , . . . , y j ( u ) ; P ( 0 , j ) ) d u = F ( τ j + 1 − s , τ 0 − τ j + 1 , . . . , τ j − τ j + 1 ; P ( 0 , j ) − F ( 0 , τ 0 − s , . . . , τ j − s ; P ( 0 , j ) Comparison of this result with ( 4 . 48 ) shows that to the existing argu - ments and parameters of T j the argument τ j + 1 − s and the parameters 3 The particular choice t = τ 0 does not restrict the conclusions . 36 4 . DECOMPOSING HEREDITARY INTEGRALS τ 0 − τ j + 1 , . . . , τ j − τ j + 1 , respectively , have to be added to obtain those of T j + 1 . This proves that ( 4 . 58 ) T j + 1 ( τ 0 , s , R , n ) = T j + 1 ( τ 0 − s , τ 1 − s , . . . , τ j + 1 − s ; P ( 0 , j + 1 ) ) . If the current time is taken to be τ 1 instead of τ 0 one ﬁnds ( 4 . 59 ) T j + 1 ( τ 1 , s , R , n ) = T j + 1 ( τ 1 − s , . . . , τ j + 1 − s ; P ( 1 , j + 1 ) ) . For the functions N j with j ≥ 1 one ﬁnds in the same way N j ( τ 1 , s , R , n ) = N j ( τ 1 − s , . . . , τ j − s ; P ( 1 , j ) ) , ( 4 . 60 ) N j ( τ 2 , s , R , n ) = N j ( τ 2 − s , . . . , τ j − s ; P ( 2 , j ) ) . ( 4 . 61 ) The present analysis can be pushed further if more speciﬁc as - sumptions on the nature of the functions φ and ϕ are made . For exam - ple , by assuming standard - linear - element material behaviour closed form expressions for the T j and N j functions were derived in Appen - dix F . 1 . 2 . Often the material behaviour is modelled as a Prony series . For this material type the functions T j and N j also have ’Prony - like’ properties as is shown in Appendix F . 2 . 2 . CHAPTER 5 A single load and unload : decomposed hereditary integrals In classic indentation the indenter is pressed into the material and subsequently retracted until contact is lost ( Fig . 5 . 1 ) . Whatever the precise shape of the curve of the contact radius actually is , it is clear that the contact radius c ( t ) increases until it reaches a maximum at time t 1 and decreases afterwards until at some time t 1 contact is lost , i . e . , c ( t 1 ) = 0 . This is the situation n = 1 from the previous paragraphs . t 1 t 1 radius t1 t0 t 1 contactradius c h = L ’ ( c ) radius h = L ’ ( c ) t1 t 1 contactradius c t0 time time R = c ( t1 ) = c ( t0 ) R = c ( t1 ) = c ( t0 ) Figure 5 . 1 . Contact radius for single load and unload process . Smooth ( left ) or kinked ( right ) at the maximum at t 1 . Contact is lost at time t 1 . The focus is here on the determination of the reduced functions φ or ϕ , i . e . , it is assumed that the elasticity factor is known and is removed from the equations by working with (cid:37) c , (cid:96) and q c ( see the deﬁnitions ( 4 . 1 ) in Chap . 4 . 1 ) 5 . 1 . The advancing phase The period 0 < τ 1 < t 1 is always a ’valley’ and ( 4 . 14 ) applies for the relation between the depth and the contact radius , i . e . , the contact radius is slaved to the depth because from R = c ( τ 1 ) one ﬁnds ( 5 . 1 ) h ( τ 1 ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( τ 1 ) ) ⇒ c ( τ 1 ) = (cid:67) ( h ( τ 1 ) ) 0 < τ 1 < t 1 . This equation applies until ˙ h becomes zero for the ﬁrst time or exhibits a jump ( see ( Fig . 5 . 1 , left and right , respectively ) . The load is now given by ( 4 . 30 ) ( 5 . 2 ) (cid:96) ( τ 1 ) + Q 0 ( τ 1 , R , 1 ) = 4 { Rh ( τ 1 ) − (cid:76) ( R ) } , τ 1 = τ 1 ( R , 1 ) . In view of ( 5 . 1 ) , the right - hand side of ( 5 . 2 ) becomes 4 { h ( τ 1 ) (cid:67) ( h ( τ 1 ) ) − (cid:76) ( (cid:67) ( h ( τ 1 ) ) ) } = 4 (cid:70) ( h ( τ 1 ) ) , and with the deﬁnition of Q 0 , according to 37 38 5 . SINGLE LOAD AND UNLOAD : DECOMPOSITION METHOD ( 4 . 29 ) , the left - hand side is found to equal [ (cid:96) ∗ d ϕ ] ( τ 1 ) . This applies for all times in the interval ( 0 , t 1 ) , so ( 3 . 3 ) is recovered in the form [ (cid:96) ∗ d ϕ ] ( t ) = 4 (cid:70) ( h ( t ) ) 0 < t < t 1 , ( 5 . 3 ) or , equivalently , (cid:96) ( t ) = 4 [ (cid:70) ( h ) ∗ d φ ] ( t ) 0 < t < t 1 . ( 5 . 4 ) From these equations data for the reduced creep and relaxation func - tion on the time interval ( 0 , t 1 ) are obtained . 5 . 2 . The receding phase The period τ 1 < t < τ 0 is a ’hill’ interval and to determine the con - tact radius the ’hill’ equation ( 4 . 26 ) at τ 0 = τ 0 ( R , 1 ) must be used : ( 5 . 5 ) (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) ( 1 + U 0 ( τ 0 , R , 1 ) ) = h ( τ 0 ) + H 0 ( τ 0 , R , 1 ) . Use of (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) = h ( τ 1 ) and the deﬁnitions ( 4 . 21 ) and ( 4 . 22 ) of U 0 and H 0 , respectively , in ( 5 . 5 ) shows that its left - hand side equals ( 5 . 6 ) (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) { 1 + U 0 ( τ 0 , R , 1 ) } = h ( τ 1 ) φ ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) , and that after one partial integration its right - hand side becomes ( 5 . 7 ) h ( τ 0 ) + H 0 ( τ 0 , R , 1 ) = h ( τ 1 ) φ ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) + τ 0 (cid:90) τ 1 φ ( τ 0 − s ) ˙ h ( s ) d s . So , ( 5 . 5 ) simpliﬁes to an equation connecting times of equal contact radius before and after the ﬁrst maximum ; ( 5 . 8 ) τ 0 (cid:90) τ 1 φ ( τ 0 − s ) ˙ h ( s ) d s = 0 , 0 < τ 1 < t 1 , τ 0 > t 1 . From this equation τ 1 must be solved as function of τ 0 , i . e . , τ 1 = Υ ( τ 0 ) , and this is possible as long as 0 < τ 0 − τ 1 < t 1 because φ is at the end of the advancing phase only known on the the interval ( 0 , t 1 ) . The contact radius has , by deﬁnition , a local maximum at t 1 and therefore Υ ( t 1 ) = t 1 . As φ never changes sign , only a change in sign of ˙ h in the interval ( τ 1 , τ 0 ) can cause ( 5 . 8 ) to be zero , the result being that the depth rate ˙ h must change sign at t 1 . This is an important point because it shows that the ﬁrst maximum of the contact radius and the depth coincide . The time interval on which the contact radius can be calculated is thus extended from the interval ( 0 , t 1 ) to ( 0 , ˆ t ) , where ˆ t is deﬁned by the equation ˆ t − Υ ( ˆ t ) = t 1 , and the contact radius satisﬁes ( 5 . 9 ) c ( t ) = (cid:40) (cid:67) ( h ( t ) ) 0 < t < t 1 , (cid:67) ( h ( Υ ( t ) ) ) t 1 < t < ˆ t . 5 . 2 . THE RECEDING PHASE 39 For the load in the receding phase , ( 4 . 36 ) applies ( 5 . 10 ) (cid:96) ( τ 0 ) − P 1 ( τ 0 , R , 1 ) = 4 R (cid:110) h ( τ 0 ) + H 0 ( τ 0 , R , 1 ) (cid:111) − 4 (cid:76) ( R ) (cid:110) 1 + U 0 ( τ 0 , R , 1 ) (cid:111) , τ 0 = τ 0 ( R , 1 ) , n = 1 . With ( 5 . 6 ) , ( 5 . 7 ) , ( 5 . 8 ) , R = (cid:67) ( h ( τ 1 ) ) and (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) = h ( τ 1 ) it can be shown that the right - hand side of ( 5 . 10 ) equals 4 φ ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) (cid:70) ( h ( τ 1 ) ) and thus ( 5 . 11 ) (cid:96) ( τ 0 ) = P 1 ( τ 0 , R , 1 ) + 4 φ ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) (cid:70) ( h ( τ 1 ) ) , τ 0 = τ 0 ( R , 1 ) , n = 1 . With the deﬁnition of P 1 ( τ 0 , R , 1 ) given in ( 4 . 35 ) and according to ( E . 8 ) with the choices a ( t ) = q c ( t ) and b ( t ) = 4 L ( R , t ) at t = τ 0 it turns out that ( 5 . 12 ) P 1 ( τ 0 , R , 1 ) = τ 1 ( R , 1 ) (cid:90) 0 (cid:96) ( s ) T 1 ( τ 0 , s , R , 1 ) d s = − 4 τ 1 ( R , 1 ) (cid:90) 0 L ( R , s ) T 0 ( τ 0 , s , R , 1 ) d s . Since T 0 = ˙ φ , one partial integration in the last integral leads to ( 5 . 13 ) P 1 ( τ 0 , R , 1 ) = 4 φ ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) L ( R , τ 1 ) − 4 L ( R , 0 ) + 4 τ 1 ( R , 1 ) (cid:90) 0 ˙ L ( R , s ) φ ( τ 0 − s ) d s . Now , L ( R , τ 1 ) = − (cid:70) ( h ( τ 1 ) ) and L ( R , 0 ) = 0 . Moreover , for 0 < s < τ 1 is ˙ L ( R , s ) = ∂ ∂ s   c ( s ) (cid:90) 0 L (cid:48) ( r , s ) d r + R (cid:90) c ( s ) L (cid:48) ( r , s ) d r   = ∂ ∂ s L ( c ( s ) , s ) = − ∂ ∂ s (cid:70) ( h ( s ) ) = (cid:67) ( h ( s ) ) ˙ h ( s ) , ( 5 . 14 ) because L ( 0 , s ) = 0 , L (cid:48) ( r , s ) = 0 if c ( s ) < r < R ( region 2 in Fig . 2 . 2 ) and L ( c ( s ) , s ) = − (cid:70) ( h ( s ) ) for 0 < s < τ 1 because h = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( (cid:67) ( h ) ) in this time range . Substitution of ( 5 . 14 ) in ( 5 . 13 ) and the result in ( 5 . 11 ) yields ( 5 . 15 ) (cid:96) ( t ) = − 4 τ 1 (cid:90) 0 φ ( τ 0 − s ) (cid:67) ( h ( s ) ˙ h ( s ) d s . The relation τ 1 = Υ ( τ 0 ) together with the replacement of τ 0 by the cur - rent time t changes the latter equation in ( 5 . 16 ) (cid:96) ( t ) = − 4 Υ ( t ) (cid:90) 0 φ ( t − s ) (cid:67) ( h ( s ) ˙ h ( s ) d s , t 1 < t . 40 5 . SINGLE LOAD AND UNLOAD : DECOMPOSITION METHOD At this stage , the function Υ ( t ) is known for t 1 < t < ˆ t ; the data (cid:96) ( t ) and h ( t ) enable computation of the relaxation and creep function on the interval ( t 1 , ˆ t ) thus extending the total time interval to ( 0 , ˆ t ) . If ˆ t is smaller than the end time of the experiment , the domain of Υ ( t ) can be extended using again ( 5 . 8 ) and , subsequently , reusing ( 5 . 16 ) to calculate the relaxation and creep function for times beyond ˆ t . 5 . 3 . Example : standard - linear - solid material behaviour Equation ( 5 . 10 ) shows that ﬁnding φ from the data is relatively straightforward once Υ ( t ) has been found . Determination of this func - tion from ( 5 . 8 ) constitutes the bottleneck in the procedure because it depends on the material properties . To demonstrate this consider a process where a cone shaped inden - ter is pressed with constant speed v 1 into a half space until a maxi - mum depth is reached at t 1 . Afterwards the indenter is retracted with t 1 t 1 depth t 1 radius c = C ( h ) t1 t 1 contactradius c t0 time time c ( t1 ) = c ( t0 ) v 1 - v 2 Figure 5 . 2 . Left : linearly increasing depth with speed v 1 and linearly decrea - sing depth with speed − v 2 . Right : possible shape of contact radius for a cone shaped indenter . At time t 1 , the indenter is not fully retracted ( right ) but looses nonetheless contact ( left ) . speed − v 2 until at some time t 1 contact is lost . In the advancing phase the relation between depth and contact radius only depends on the indenter shape , a cone in this case , and Table B . 1 shows that in this phase : ( 5 . 17 ) c ( t ) = (cid:67) ( h ( t ) ) = 2 h ( t ) k 1 π , 0 ≤ t ≤ t 1 , k 1 : constant . Later – the receding phase – the contact radius also depends on the material properties . Assuming a reduced relaxation function as de - scribed by that of a standard linear solid ( see Chap . F . 1 . 1 ) , i . e . , ( 5 . 18 ) φ ( t ) = ( 1 − q ) + q exp ( − κ t ) , 0 < q < 1 , κ > 0 , t > 0 , the equation ( 5 . 8 ) becomes ( 5 . 19 ) v 1 t 1 (cid:90) τ 1 ( 1 − q ) + q exp ( − κ ( τ 0 − τ ) ) d τ = v 2 τ 0 (cid:90) t 1 ( 1 − q ) + q exp ( − κ ( τ 0 − τ ) ) d τ 5 . 3 .

The lines ’elastic’ are added for comparison with the purely elastic case . The introduction of the scaled variables s = κτ , β = κτ 0 , α = κτ 1 , s m = κ t 1 , a = q / ( 1 − q ) , and b = v 2 / v 1 plus division by v 1 ( 1 − q ) , simpliﬁes 42 5 . SINGLE LOAD AND UNLOAD : DECOMPOSITION METHOD ( 5 . 19 ) to ( 5 . 20 ) s m (cid:90) α 1 + a exp ( − ( β − s ) ) d s = b β (cid:90) s m 1 + a exp ( − ( β − s ) ) d s . From ( 5 . 20 ) the variable α – actually the function κ Υ – can be solved as function of β . The solution involves the main branch W 0 of the Lam - bert W function 1 , i . e . , the solution of the equation x = W 0 ( x ) expW 0 ( x ) for x > − exp ( − 1 ) . Speciﬁcally ( 5 . 21 ) α ( β , s m , a , b ) = β + g ( β , s m , a , b ) − W 0 (cid:161) a exp { g ( β , s m , a , b } (cid:162) , where g is deﬁned by ( 5 . 22 ) g ( β , s m , a , b ) = ( 1 + b ) { a exp ( s m − β ) + s m − β } − ab . Fig . 5 . 3 shows the results of such a computation 2 using that c ( β ) = c ( α ) . Three speed ratios v 2 / v 1 and three ratios κ t 1 of the characteris - tic rise time of the depth and the characteristic relaxation time of the standard linear element were considered . The parameter a = q / ( 1 − q ) was chosen to be equal to 1 which corresponds to φ ( ∞ ) = 1 / 2 . All graphs show that during the retraction phase of the indenter which in itself leads to a receding contact , the receding speed of the contact is ampliﬁed by the viscoelastic properties of the material . Speciﬁcally , stress relaxation of the material leads to a faster receding contact dur - ing the retraction phase compared to the same experiment performed on a purely elastic material . The magnitude of this effect depends on the magnitude of the ratio κ t 1 , i . e . , the ratio of the relevant time scales in the experiment . So , the contact radius becomes zero before the in - denter is completely retracted as is visible in the graphs in Fig . 5 . 3 because the ’elastic’ comparison graph also indicates the position of the cone - shaped indenter because c ( t ) / c ( t 1 ) equals h ( t ) / h ( t 1 ) . 1 See for instance [ 28 ] for the history of this function , its occurrence in science and technology and the question how to calculate it . 2 Alternatively , one can calculate the inverse , i . e . , β as function of α and the parameters s m , a and b . The Lambert W function also appears in the solution in this case . CHAPTER 6 Dynamic load - depth sensing : decomposed hereditary integrals The previous chapter showed that the classic analysis of dynamic load - depth sensing experiment is actually limited to those cases were a monotonic contact radius is always or almost always present . The practical important case of a ﬂuctuating perturbation superposed on an applied step shaped carrier is not in this category and an interme - diate step is needed here . In this step , a link is established between the input variable ( depth or load ) on the one hand and the contact radius on the other . This link and how it depends on the material properties is the topic of the Secs 6 . 1 – 6 . 3 . The actual determination of the viscoelastic material parameters , the ﬁnal step ( Chap . 6 . 4 ) , uses this link . This part is only treated at a general level . 6 . 1 . The stationary state For the present analysis 1 only a certain type of control variables is considered , namely a ( relatively small ) sinusoidal perturbation su - perposed on a step shaped carrier variable and it is also restricted to the stationary state , i . e . , the region of time for which depth , contact time t contactradius tn - 1 tn tn - 1 t 0 t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 tn - 2 c ( tn ) r = R = c ( t 0 ) = c ( t 1 ) = c ( t 2 ) = . . . tn tn + 1 c ( tn ) L L L L Figure 6 . 1 . Periodic contact radius during the stationary phase . The times t n and t n indicate the times of the maxima and the minima of the contact radius , respectively . 1 As in Chap . 5 it is also assumed that the elasticity factor is already known and removed from the equations by working with (cid:37) c , (cid:96) and q c ( see the deﬁnitions ( 4 . 1 ) in Chap . 4 . 1 ) . 43 44 6 . DYNAMIC LOAD DEPTH SENSING : DECOMPOSITION METHOD radius and and load vary periodically ( Fig . 6 . 1 ) around a steady state . The steady state is – by deﬁnition – the asymptotic response if only the step shaped carrier variable is used as input . For the steady state the results of Chap . 3 . 1 apply with ( 6 . 1 ) h ( t ) = h g H ( t ) , c ( t ) = (cid:67) ( h g ) , (cid:96) ( t ) ∼ 4 (cid:70) ( h g ) φ ( ∞ ) for depth control ( Chap . 3 . 1 . 1 ) , whereas for load control ( Chap . 3 . 1 . 2 ) ( 6 . 2 ) (cid:96) ( t ) = (cid:96) g H ( t ) , (cid:70) ( h ( t ) ) ∼ (cid:96) g ϕ ( ∞ ) / 4 , c ( t ) ∼ (cid:67) ( h ( ∞ ) ) . Well into the stationary phase the contact radius changes periodically and the number of ’hills’ and ’valleys’ that were crossed in the past is very large . The equations from Chap . 4 relating depth , contact radius and load during an arbitrary ’valley’ plus subsequent ’hill’ period also involve all previous ’valleys’ and ’hills’ because the sums in these for - mulae do so . However , increasing the values of the counting subscripts of terms in these sums means going further back in the deformation or loading history and decreasing inﬂuence of these terms on the current response is to be expected , i . e . , the contribution of the integral opera - tors U j , V j , H j W j , P j and Q j to the sums decreases if the value of j increases . So , it may well be assumed that the control is switched on at t = −∞ and that the number of terms in the sums is inﬁnite . The period Λ = 2 π / Ω of the control variable equals that of the other dependent variables . So , the intersection times with even index are related to τ 0 and those with odd index to τ 1 ( see Fig . 6 . 1 ) . Speciﬁcally , for j = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . , ( 6 . 3 ) τ 2 j ( R , n ) = τ 0 ( R , n ) − j Λ , τ 2 j + 1 ( R , n ) = τ 1 ( R , n ) − j Λ . In the stationary phase all ’hills’ and all ’valleys’ are equivalent , ( 6 . 4 ) τ 0 ( R , n − j ) = τ 0 ( R , n , τ 1 ( R , n − j ) = τ 1 ( R , n ) , implying that now τ 0 and τ 1 are independent of the ’hill’ number n , i . e . , τ 0 = τ 0 ( R ) and τ 1 = τ 1 ( R ) . For the analysis it sufﬁces to take as control variable a single sinusoidal function with period Λ . However , from here on the time will be scaled on Ω , so the period becomes 2 π . The analysis in H shows that during the stationary phase the max - ima of the contact radius and the depth coincide , whereas the minima of the contact radius coincide with those of the load . The relation be - tween the maxima of the contact and the depth is independent of the material behaviour because according to ( H . 1 ) and ( H . 10 ) in Appendix H . 1 is ( 6 . 5 ) h ( t n ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t n ) ) , ˙ c ( t n ) = 0 , ˙ h ( t n ) = 0 . The relation between the minima of the contact and the load is not so simple because it depends also on the material properties ; at the times 6 . 2 . DEPTH CONTROL : GENERAL CASE 45 t n , when the contact is minimal , load and contact radius are related by ( see ( H . 15 ) and ( H . 25 ) in Appendix H . 2 ) ( 6 . 6 ) (cid:96) ( t n ) = 4 (cid:71) ( c ( t n ) ) φ ( ∞ ) ˙ c ( t n ) = 0 , ˙ (cid:96) ( t n ) = 0 . These results suggest to choose h ( t ) = h max { 1 + h 1 ( cos t − 1 ) } as input for depth controlled experiments and (cid:96) ( t ) = (cid:96) min { 1 − (cid:96) 1 ( cos t − 1 ) } as input function for load controls . The advantage of these choices is that the location in time of the extrema of the contact radius are known from the recorded data for depth and load . The maxima h max and c max = (cid:67) ( h max ) of depth and contact radius both occur at times 2 n π if the depth is controlled and the minimum of the measured load coincides with the minimum of the contact radius . Similarly , if the load is chosen as control variable , the minima (cid:96) min of the load and contact radius also occur at 2 n π and the times of the maximum contact radius follow now from the recorded depth data . 1 Scaled time S c a l ed c on t a c t r ad i u s Depth control Y = τ 0 − τ 1 Load control Y = τ 1 − τ 2 τ 2 τ 1 valley n hill n τ 0 τ 1 Figure 6 . 2 .

Radius is scaled by c min . Aim is to determine τ 1 as function of Y = τ 1 − τ 2 for the ascending part of a representative ’valley’ . The idea is to reconstruct the shape of a representative period of the scaled contact radius ( Fig . 6 . 2 ) using the equations derived in Chap . 4 , i . e . , the equations that relate depth and contact radius or load and contact radius during an arbitrary ’valley’ and subsequent ’hill’ period . For depth controlled indentation the ’hill’ equations ( 4 . 24 ) and ( 4 . 26 ) are used whereas for load control the ’valley’ equations ( 4 . 41 ) and ( 4 . 42 ) are used as starting point . The sums appearing in these for - mulae involved all previous ’valleys’ and ’hills’ , the number of which is here taken to be inﬁnite as the system is considered to be switched on at t = −∞ . 6 . 2 . Depth controlled contact radius : general viscoelastic material behaviour The depth function , h ( t ) = h max { 1 + h 1 ( cos t − 1 ) } is maximal at t = t n , where is further irrelevant except that τ 0 and τ 1 are deﬁned as the 46 6 . DYNAMIC LOAD DEPTH SENSING : DECOMPOSITION METHOD ﬁrst times after and before t n , respectively , where c ( t ) = R . In the stationary state the equations ( 4 . 26 ) and ( 4 . 24 ) ) relating depth h and radius R are h ( τ 0 ) + ∞ (cid:88) j = 0 H j ( τ 0 ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 + ∞ (cid:88) j = 0 U j ( τ 0 ) (cid:33) , τ 0 = τ 0 ( R ) , ( 6 . 7 ) h ( τ 1 ) + ∞ (cid:88) j = 1 H j ( τ 1 ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 + ∞ (cid:88) j = 1 U j ( τ 1 ) (cid:33) , τ 1 = τ 1 ( R ) , ( 6 . 8 ) and they are valid along a descending and ascending part of an arbi - trary ’hill’ , respectively . Substitution of h ( t ) in the deﬁnition of H j ( t ) , ( 4 . 22 ) , yields ( 6 . 9 ) H j ( t ) = h max { ( 1 − h 1 ) U j ( t ) + h 1 F j ( t ) } , with 2 ( 6 . 10 ) F j ( t ) = τ 2 j (cid:90) τ 2 j + 1 T 2 j ( t , s , R ) cos s d s . Use of these relations in ( 6 . 7 ) and ( 6 . 8 ) leads , after division by h max = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c max ) , to the matrix equation ( 6 . 11 ) h 1   cos τ 0 + ∞ (cid:80) 0 F j ( τ 0 ) cos τ 1 + ∞ (cid:80) 1 F j ( τ 1 )   = (cid:65) ( R , c max , h 1 )   1 + ∞ (cid:80) 0 U j ( τ 0 ) 1 + ∞ (cid:80) 1 U j ( τ 1 )   , with ( 6 . 12 ) (cid:65) ( R , c max , h 1 ) = (cid:181) (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c max ) − 1 + h 1 (cid:182) . For all conical , parabolic or other ’power - law shaped’ indenters the ratio (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) / (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c max ) depends exclusively on the scaled radius R / c max , e . g . , ( 6 . 13 ) (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) / (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c max ) = (cid:40) R / c max ( cone ) , ( R / c max ) 2 ( parabola ) . In Fig . 6 . 3 , the time difference Y = τ 0 − τ 1 ranges from 0 to 2 π when the contact radius decreases from c max to c min and it does not matter which period of the stationary phase is considered . So , for an arbitrary ’hill’ with maximum at t n one can use τ 0 = t n + X along the descending ’slope’ and the idea is to determine ﬁrst X as function of the difference Y = τ 0 − τ 1 and this solution must have the properties X = 0 if Y = 0 and X = t n + 1 − t n if Y = 2 π . To do so , the equations ( 6 . 11 ) need to 2 The function F j ( t ) also depends on the particular value of R and on the mate - rial constants ˜ p , just like the other integrals – U j , V j , H j W j , P j and Q j – do . To obtain concise formulae this dependence is only explicitly written down if confusion may arise . 6 . 2 .

Maxima of depth and contact radius coincide at t n . Calculation of τ 0 − t n as function of Y = τ 0 − τ 1 along the descending branch t n < τ 0 < t n + 1 of a typical period . be rewritten in terms of the new variables Y and X . Obviously , also the parameters used to describe the material behaviour , i . e . , the set ˜ p , appear in the function X and thus both τ 0 and τ 1 appear to be a function of Y and ˜ p : τ 0 = t n + X ( Y , ˜ p ) and τ 1 = t n + X ( Y , ˜ p ) − Y but this dependence will not always be explicitly indicated further on . As t n is a multiple of 2 π , τ 0 = 2 n π + X and τ 1 = 2 n π + ( X − Y ) , it follows that cos τ 0 = cos X and cos τ 1 = cos ( X − Y ) . The sum terms U j and F j in ( 6 . 11 ) involve integrals of T 2 j ( τ i , s ) and T 2 j ( τ i , s ) cos s for i = 0 , 1 . It is shown in Chap . 4 . 7 ( see ( 4 . 50 ) and ( 4 . 59 ) ) that the T 2 j - kernels are always of the form 3 T 2 j ( τ 0 , s ) = T 2 j ( τ 0 − s , τ 1 − s , . . . , τ 2 j − s ; P ( 0 , 2 j ) ) , j = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . , ( 6 . 14 ) T 2 j ( τ 1 , s ) = T 2 j ( τ 1 − s , τ 2 − s , . . . , τ 2 j − s ; P ( 1 , 2 j ) ) , j = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . . ( 6 . 15 ) The elements of the sets P ( 0 , 2 j ) and P ( 1 , 2 j ) are composed of differ - ences between any τ k and another τ i ( see ( 4 . 52 ) ) . For periodic contact radii – the period is 2 π in the present case – the elements of the sets P ( 0 , 2 j ) and P ( 1 , 2 j ) are equal to either a multiple of 2 π or to the sum of Y and such a multiple of 2 π ; the sets both depend on Y but not on X . As the integration variable s of the integrals in the sums range from τ 2 j + 1 to τ 2 j with τ 2 j − τ 2 j + 1 = Y , the substitution s = τ 2 j + 1 + u then shows that the dependence of the kernel functions T 2 j on the variable s involves only the independent variables u and Y ; the kernels T 2 j and – by extension – the sum terms U j do not depend on X . However , the sum terms F j do because the same substitution , i . e . , s = τ 2 j + 1 + u , 3 In F . 1 . 2 more speciﬁc formula are derived for the functions T j when the mate - rial is assumed to behave like a standard linear element – actually the most simple case . For more general material behaviour often a Prony series ( Appendix F . 2 ) is used and formulae facilitating the computation of the kernels T j and N j for this case were derived in Appendix F . 2 . 2 . 48 6 . DYNAMIC LOAD DEPTH SENSING : DECOMPOSITION METHOD transforms the function cos s in the integrands into cos ( X − Y + u ) be - cause τ 2 j + 1 = τ 1 − 2 j π = t n + X − Y − 2 j π and t n is a multiple of 2 π . All these considerations lead to the conclusion that always – whatever the assumed functional form of φ – the equations ( 6 . 11 ) can be written as ( 6 . 16 ) h 1 (cid:183) m 11 ( Y ) m 12 ( Y ) m 21 ( Y ) m 22 ( Y ) (cid:184)(cid:183) sin ( X ) cos ( X ) (cid:184) = (cid:65) ( R , c max , h 1 ) (cid:183) b 1 ( Y ) b 2 ( Y ) (cid:184) . Multiplication of ( 6 . 16 ) from the left with the row [ b 2 − b 1 ] eliminates the factor (cid:65) from the resulting equation from which now X as function of Y can be found . The problem with this direct approach is that the mathematics is somewhat tricky as the solution is multivalued and physical arguments must be used to resolve these matters during the solution process . Therefore it makes sense to push the analysis one step further by taking ( 6 . 17 ) X = Y 2 + α and solving for α instead of X . The rationale for this shift is that the contact radius cannot have the same type of symmetry as the depth . Whereas the depth has mirror symmetry around all maxima at t n , the contact radius does not have this symmetry and the function α takes this difference into account 4 . The new set of equations arrived at is ( 6 . 18 ) h 1 (cid:183) m 11 m 12 m 21 m 22 (cid:184)(cid:183) cos (cid:161) Y 2 (cid:162) sin (cid:161) Y 2 (cid:162) − sin (cid:161) Y 2 (cid:162) cos (cid:161) Y 2 (cid:162) (cid:184)(cid:183) sin ( α ) cos ( α ) (cid:184) = (cid:65) (cid:183) b 1 b 2 (cid:184) . Now , multiplication of ( 6 . 18 ) from the left by the row [ b 2 − b 1 ] shows that the ﬁnal equation is ( 6 . 19 ) β 1 ( Y ) sin ( α ) + β 2 ( Y ) cos ( α ) = 0 , with ( 6 . 20 ) β 1 ( Y ) = cos (cid:181) Y 2 (cid:182)(cid:110) b 2 ( Y ) m 11 ( Y ) − b 1 ( Y ) m 21 ( Y ) (cid:111) , + sin (cid:181) Y 2 (cid:182)(cid:110) − b 2 ( Y ) m 12 ( Y ) + b 1 ( Y ) m 22 ( Y ) (cid:111) , and ( 6 . 21 ) β 2 ( Y ) = cos (cid:181) Y 2 (cid:182)(cid:110) b 2 ( Y ) m 12 ( Y ) − b 1 m 22 ( Y ) (cid:111) + sin (cid:181) Y 2 (cid:182)(cid:110) b 2 ( Y ) m 11 ( Y ) − b 1 ( Y ) m 21 ( Y ) (cid:111) . The solution of ( 6 . 19 ) shows that ( 6 . 22 ) X ( Y ) = Y 2 + α ( Y ) = Y 2 + arctan (cid:181) − β 2 ( Y ) β 1 ( Y ) (cid:182) . 4 A contact radius with mirror symmetry around the maximum always has the property X = Y / 2 . 6 . 2 . DEPTH CONTROL : GENERAL CASE 49 From the sum of the two components of ( 6 . 16 ) , (cid:65) can be found , and then with ( 6 . 22 ) , (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c max ) = h max and the deﬁnition ( 6 . 12 ) of (cid:65) leads to ( 6 . 23 ) (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) = h max (cid:181) 1 − h 1 × (cid:181) 1 − 2 (cid:80) i = 1 (cid:110) sin ( X ( Y ) ) m i 1 ( Y ) + cos ( X ( Y ) ) m i 2 ( Y ) (cid:111) b 1 ( Y ) + b 2 ( Y ) (cid:182)(cid:182) . With R = (cid:67) ( (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) ) , (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) can be inverted , generating R as function of Y . The results ( 6 . 22 ) and ( 6 . 23 ) constitute a parameterized description – with Y as the parameter ranging from 0 to 2 π – of the contact radius graph in the t - r plane during a single period , i . e . , ( 6 . 24 ) ( t , c ( t ) ) =    ( τ 0 , c ( τ 0 ) ) = ( t n + Y 2 + α ( Y ) , R ( Y ) ) ( descending part ) , ( τ 1 , c ( τ 1 ) ) = ( t n − Y 2 + α ( Y ) , R ( Y ) ) ( ascending part ) . For interpretation of this result it should be kept in mind that the set ˜ p of material parameters and the set h = { h max , h 1 } of depth parameters also appear in this description because X = X ( Y ; ˜ p ) and R ( Y ; ˜ p , h ) . The contact between the indenter and the substrate is lost when - ever the contact radius becomes zero before the indenter is retracted . For the present setup , the minimum of the contact radius occurs at Y = 2 π and contact is maintained if (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R = 2 π ) > 0 . After deﬁning the function 5 ( 6 . 25 ) D ( ˜ p ) = 2 (cid:80) i = 1 (cid:110) sin ( X ( 2 π , ˜ p ) ) m i 1 ( 2 π , ˜ p ) + cos ( X ( 2 π , ˜ p ) ) m i 2 ( 2 π , ˜ p ) (cid:111) b 1 ( 2 π , ˜ p ) + b 2 ( 2 π , ˜ p ) , it follows from ( 6 . 23 ) that D ( ˜ p ) > 1 − 1 / h 1 : ⇒ (cid:76) (cid:48) ( 0 ) > 0 ⇒ c > 0 : contact , D ( ˜ p ) = 1 − 1 / h 1 : ⇒ (cid:76) (cid:48) ( 0 ) = 0 ⇒ c = 0 : loss of contact at minimum , D ( ˜ p ) < 1 − 1 / h 1 : ⇒ (cid:76) (cid:48) ( 0 ) < 0 ⇒ c < 0 : impossible , contact was lost . The last inequality suggests that too large a value of h 1 might even prohibit the build up of a stationary state as during the experiment contact is probably repeatedly lost . Finally , as the result ( 6 . 22 ) for X ( Y , ˜ p ) is independent of the depth parameter h max and h 1 , it follows that τ 0 − t n depends only on the ma - terial parameters ˜ p . At t n + 1 = t n + X ( 2 π , ˜ p ) the contact radius reaches a minimum and here also the load reaches a minimum ( see H . 2 ) . On the other hand , the depth reaches a minimum at t n + π . Consequently , 5 For clarity , the dependence on the material parameters ˜ p is again included . 50 6 . DYNAMIC LOAD DEPTH SENSING : DECOMPOSITION METHOD the time difference π − X ( 2 π , ˜ p ) is a measure for the phase shift be - tween depth and load and this phase shift depends only on the pa - rameter set ˜ p . However , note that the time - like members of the set ˜ p also involve the unit of time 2 π / Ω of the actually prescribed frequency ; from a physics point of view , the set ˜ p also depends on Ω and the phase shift does so as well . 6 . 2 . 1 . Depth control : the ’standard linear solid’ . For mate - rial behaviour modelled as the so - called ’standard linear solid’ it was shown in Appendix F . 1 . 2 that the functions T 2 j ( t , s ) are proportional to T 0 = ˙ φ because the rates ˙ φ and ˙ ϕ entering the transformation for - mulae are simple exponentials . Therefore , substitution of ( F . 10 ) and ( F . 11 ) in the deﬁnitions of U j and F j yields U j ( t ) = − q κ exp (cid:161) − κ t + q κγ 2 j (cid:162) τ 2 j (cid:90) τ 2 j + 1 exp ( κ s ) d s , ( 6 . 26 ) F j ( t ) = − q κ exp (cid:161) − κ t + q κγ 2 j (cid:162) τ 2 j (cid:90) τ 2 j + 1 exp ( κ s ) cos ( s ) d s ( 6 . 27 ) with γ 2 j = − j ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) + 2 j π because of the periodicity of the contact ra - dius . These integrals were evaluated in Appendix I . 1 for t = τ 0 = t n + X and t = τ 1 = τ 0 − Y using also τ 2 j + 1 = τ 1 − 2 j π and τ 2 j = τ 0 − 2 j π ; formu - lae for the matrix coefﬁcients m ij and b i appearing in ( 6 . 18 ) can also be found there . These expressions will be used in the next paragraph to investigate the inﬂuence of the material parameters q and κ on the shape of the contact radius , the time to go from a maximum to the next minimum ( receding time ) and the value of h 1 for which contact is lost . 6 . 2 . 1 . 1 . Inﬂuence of the parameters , q , κ and h 1 on the contact radius . Fig . 6 . 4 shows , for twelve different parameter combinations ( q , κ ) , graphs of the contact radius of a conical indenter as function of time during an arbitrary period in the stationary state . The relative size h 1 of the sinusoidal perturbations is always 0 . 1 in these graphs . The parameter q equals φ ( 0 ) − φ ( ∞ ) , i . e . , the difference between ini - tial and long term elastic response . So for small q elastic effects are expected to dominate whereas for q - values approaching 1 , viscous ef - fects become more important . Four values for q were investigated , namely q = 1 / 5 , 2 / 5 , 3 / 5 and 4 / 5 . If κ < < 1 the time scale of the control variable is small with respect to that of the relaxation and for κ > > 1 the reverse is true . The three investigated values for κ were 1 / 10 , 1 and 10 . The graphs of Fig . 6 . 4 remain valid for all axisymmetric and convex indenters if the ordinate is interpreted as (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) / h m ; for in - stance when the ordinate is replaced by its root then the graph for a parabolic indenter is found . 6 . 2 .

Depth controlled stationary state , conical indenter . Relative con - tact radius c ( t ) / c max as function of the scaled time t sca = ( t − t n ) / 2 π for a complete period t n < t < t n + 1 . Parameters : h 1 = 1 / 10 , q = 1 / 5 , 2 / 5 , 3 / 5 , 4 / 5 and κ = 1 / 10 , 1 and 10 . For an elastic material , the minimal value is always 1 − 2 h 1 at t sca = 1 / 2 . Taking the root of the ordinate yields the graphs for a parabolic indenter . In the stationary state , the magnitude and time of occurrence of the maxima are completely determined by the depth . At ﬁrst sight it would seem that viscoelasticity has more effect on the magnitude of the minimal contact radius than on the times t n the minima are at - tained . A plot of the relative shift of the time of the contact minimum in Fig . 6 . 5 shows that the time needed to go from a maximum to a min - imum decreases if q approaches 1 . The inﬂuence of κ is more involved because – for ﬁxed q – an initial decrease of the period of time to reach a minimum is followed by an increase if κ increases . The largest effect occurs if κ is of order 1 , that is , if the physical relaxation time and the period of the actually applied depth function are of the same order of magnitude . Generally , however , it can be concluded that the contact radius reaches its minimum before the depth does ( t n + 1 − t n < π ) . The behaviour of the function D from ( 6 . 25 ) is also illuminating as far as the inﬂuence of viscoelasticity is concerned . Loss of contact 52 6 .

The transition value of h 1 , i . e . , h 1 , trans = 1 − D ( q , κ ) is shown in Fig . 6 . 6 . For any ﬁxed value q , this graph reveals that permanent contact prevails if h 1 and κ yield a ( h 1 , κ ) point below the curve in this plot . 6 . 3 . Load controlled contact radius : general viscoelastic material behaviour As explained in Chap . 6 . 1 , the minimum of the contact radius is taken as a reference value because in a load driven stationary state the minima of load and contact radius coincide , i . e . , (cid:96) ( t n ) = (cid:96) min = 4 (cid:71) ( c min ) φ ( ∞ ) . Moreover , it was suggested to use the load function (cid:96) ( t ) = (cid:96) min { 1 − (cid:96) 1 ( cos ( t ) − 1 ) } . The equations relating load and contact radius are ( 4 . 41 ) and ( 4 . 42 ) and they are valid in an arbitrary ’valley’ 6 . 3 .

With this , and after division by (cid:96) min = 4 (cid:71) ( c min ) φ ( ∞ ) , the following ma - trix equation is obtained ( 6 . 32 ) ( 1 + (cid:96) 1 )   1 + ∞ (cid:80) k = 0 N k ( τ 1 ) 1 + ∞ (cid:80) k = 1 N k ( τ 2 )   − (cid:96) 1   cos τ 1 + ∞ (cid:80) k = 0 S k ( τ 1 ) cos τ 2 + ∞ (cid:80) k = 1 S k ( τ 2 )   = (cid:71) ( R ) (cid:71) ( c min ) φ ( ∞ )   1 − ∞ (cid:80) k = 1 V k ( τ 1 ) 1 − ∞ (cid:80) k = 1 V k ( τ 2 )   .

Calculation of τ 1 − t n as function of Y = τ 1 − τ 2 along the ascending branch t n < τ 1 < t n + 1 of a typical period . is zero at an arbitrary time t n at which the contact radius is minimal ( Fig . 6 . 7 ) . Therefore , with τ 1 = t n + X and τ 2 = t n + X − Y , the idea is again to derive equations linking X and Y . For the same reasons as mentioned previously in Chap . 6 . 2 , the actual calculation is again through the intermediate variable α – deﬁned by α = X − Y / 2 – which measures the deviation from the mirror symmetry the contact radius exhibits around the minima at t n ; for this , the equations ( 6 . 34 ) need to be rewritten in terms of the new variables . The times t n are multiples of 2 π and cos ( τ 1 ) = cos ( X ) plus cos τ 2 = cos ( X − Y ) = sin X sin Y + cos X cos Y . The terms N k and S k in the sums in ( 6 . 34 ) involve integrals of N 2 k + 1 ( τ i , s ) and N 2 k + 1 ( τ i , s ) cos s for i = 1 , 2 . In Chap . 4 . 7 ( see ( 4 . 60 ) – ( 4 . 61 ) ) it is shown that the N l kernels are – just like the T j ’s – always of the form 7 N l ( τ 1 , s ) = N 2 k + 1 ( τ 1 − s , τ 2 − s , . . . , τ l − s ; P ( 1 , l ) ) , ( 6 . 37 ) N l ( τ 2 , s ) = N 2 k + 1 ( τ 2 − s , τ 3 − s , . . . , τ l − s ; P ( 2 , l ) ) . ( 6 . 38 ) Due to the 2 π periodicity of the contact radius , the elements of the sets P ( 1 , l ) and P ( 2 , l ) are equal to either a multiple of 2 π or to the sum of such a multiple of 2 π and Y ; both sets depend on Y but not on X . The integration variable s of the N 2 k and S 2 k integrals ranges from τ 2 k + 2 to τ 2 k + 1 with τ 2 k + 1 − τ 2 k + 2 = Y . The substitution s = τ 2 j + 2 + u 7 See also footnote 3 . 6 . 3 . DEPTH CONTROL : GENERAL CASE 55 then shows that the dependence of N 2 k + 1 on the variable s involves only the independent variables u and Y ; the N 2 k + 1 - functions and – by extension – the sum terms N k do not depend on X . However , the terms in (cid:80) S k do , because the substitution s = τ 2 j + 1 + u transforms the function cos s in the integrand into cos ( X − Y + u ) . Just as in Chap . 6 . 2 it is concluded that the equations ( 6 . 34 ) can be written as ( 6 . 39 ) − (cid:96) 1 (cid:183) ˆ m 11 ( Y ) ˆ m 12 ( Y ) ˆ m 21 ( Y ) ˆ m 22 ( Y ) (cid:184)(cid:183) sin ( X ) cos ( X ) (cid:184) = (cid:66) ( R , c min , (cid:96) 1 ) (cid:183) ˆ b 1 ( Y ) ˆ b 2 ( Y ) (cid:184) . and they can be solved in the same way as described there , i . e . , by setting X = Y / 2 + α ( Y ) . Now , ( 6 . 40 ) ˆ β 1 ( Y ) = cos (cid:181) Y 2 (cid:182)(cid:110) ˆ b 2 ( Y ) ˆ m 11 ( Y ) − ˆ b 1 ( Y ) ˆ m 21 ( Y ) (cid:111) , + sin (cid:181) Y 2 (cid:182)(cid:110) − ˆ b 2 ( Y ) ˆ m 12 ( Y ) + ˆ b 1 ( Y ) ˆ m 22 ( Y ) (cid:111) plus ( 6 . 41 ) ˆ β 2 ( Y ) = cos (cid:181) Y 2 (cid:182)(cid:110) ˆ b 2 ( Y ) ˆ m 12 ( Y ) − ˆ b 1 ˆ m 22 ( Y ) (cid:111) + sin (cid:181) Y 2 (cid:182)(cid:110) ˆ b 2 ( Y ) ˆ m 11 ( Y ) − ˆ b 1 ( Y ) ˆ m 21 ( Y ) (cid:111) . and the equation for α is ( 6 . 42 ) ˆ β 1 ( Y ) sin ( α ( Y ) ) + ˆ β 2 ( Y ) cos ( α ( Y ) ) = 0 . which leads to ( 6 . 43 ) X ( Y ) = Y 2 + α ( Y ) = Y 2 + arctan (cid:181) − ˆ β 2 ( Y ) ˆ β 1 ( Y ) (cid:182) . Finally , the sum of the components of ( 6 . 39 ) yields the equation ( 6 . 44 ) (cid:71) ( R ) = (cid:71) ( c min ) (cid:181) 1 + (cid:96) 1 × (cid:181) 1 − 2 (cid:80) i = 1 (cid:110) sin ( X ( Y ) ) ˆ m i 1 ( Y ) + cos ( X ( Y ) ) ˆ m i 2 ( Y ) (cid:111) ˆ b 1 ( Y ) + ˆ b 2 ( Y ) (cid:182)(cid:182) . For a conical or parabolical indenter the scaled radius R sca = R / c min follows from this result because ( 6 . 45 ) R sca =   (cid:110) (cid:71) ( R ) / (cid:71) ( c min ) (cid:111) 1 / 2 ( cone ) , (cid:110) (cid:71) ( R ) / (cid:71) ( c min ) (cid:111) 1 / 3 ( parabola ) . For these indenter types , the equations ( 6 . 43 ) and ( 6 . 44 ) constitute a parameterized description of the scaled contact radius during a single 56 6 . DYNAMIC LOAD DEPTH SENSING : DECOMPOSITION METHOD period , i . e . , ( 6 . 46 ) ( t , c ( t ) c min ) =   ( τ 1 , c ( τ 1 ) c min ) = ( t n + Y 2 + α ( Y ) , R sca ( Y ) ) ( ascending part ) , ( τ 2 , c ( τ 2 ) c min ) = ( t n − Y 2 + α ( Y ) , R sca ( Y ) ) ( descending part ) . For other indenter types , ( 6 . 44 ) is rewritten as ( 6 . 47 ) (cid:71) ( R ) = (cid:96) min 4 φ ( ∞ ) (cid:181) 1 + (cid:96) 1 × (cid:181) 1 − 2 (cid:80) k = 1 (cid:110) sin ( X ( Y ) ) ˆ m k 1 ( Y ) + cos ( X ( Y ) ) ˆ m k 2 ( Y ) (cid:111) ˆ b 1 ( Y ) + ˆ b 2 ( Y ) (cid:182)(cid:182) , and inversion of (cid:71) generates R ( Y ) , i . e . , the contact radius as function 8 of Y , ˜ p and the set of load parameters (cid:96) = { (cid:96) min , (cid:96) 1 } . For interpretation of these results it should be kept in mind that the set ˜ p of material parameters and the set (cid:96) = { (cid:96) min , (cid:96) 1 } of load parameters also appear in these descriptions because X = X ( Y ; ˜ p ) and R = R ( Y ; ˜ p , (cid:96) ) . Just like ( 6 . 22 ) is the result ( 6 . 43 ) independent of the amplitude parameters (cid:96) min and (cid:96) 1 of the load ; X = τ 1 − t n depends only on Y and the material parameters ˜ p . At t n = t n + X ( 2 π , ˜ p ) the contact ra - dius reaches a maximum and the depth is also maximal here ( see H . 2 ) whereas the load is maximal at t n + π . Therefore , the time difference π − X ( 2 π , ˜ p ) is again a measure for the phase shift between depth and load and this shift depends only on the material constants ˜ p , but , as already mentioned several times , from a physics point of view the shift also depends on the period of the actually applied load function . An important difference between depth and load control is that no loss of contact occurs as long as (cid:96) ( t ) is positive , which is always the case as (cid:96) min is positive ; a function comparable to D ( ˜ p ) from Chap . 6 . 2 ( see ( 6 . 25 ) ) does not exist for load control . 6 . 3 . 1 . Load control : the ’standard linear solid’ . For load con - trol the functions N 2 k + 1 are needed and for standard linear material behaviour it was shown in F . 1 . 2 that these functions are proportional to N 1 = ˙ ϕ because the rates ˙ φ and ˙ ϕ entering the transformation for - mulae are simple exponentials . Therefore , substitution of ( F . 18 ) in the deﬁnitions ( 6 . 30 ) of N k and S k results in ( 6 . 48 ) N k ( t ) = q κ exp (cid:161) − κ ( 1 − q ) t + q κ ( γ 2 k + 1 − τ 1 ) (cid:162) τ 2 k + 1 (cid:90) τ 2 k + 2 exp ( κ ( 1 − q ) s ) d s , 8 Note that φ ( ∞ ) is not an independent parameter , it is a function of ˜ p . 6 . 3 . DEPTH CONTROL : GENERAL CASE 57 and ( 6 . 49 ) S k ( t ) = q κ exp (cid:161) − κ ( 1 − q ) t + q κ ( γ 2 k + 1 − τ 1 ) (cid:162) × τ 2 k + 1 (cid:90) τ 2 k + 2 exp ( κ ( 1 − q ) s ) cos ( s ) d s . From ( F . 11 ) , the deﬁnition of γ j , and the relations between the τ ’s for a 2 π periodic contact radius it follows that ( 6 . 50 ) γ 2 k + 1 − τ 1 = − k { 2 π − ( τ 2 − τ 1 ) } . The integrals ( 6 . 48 ) and ( 6 . 49 ) were evaluated in Appendix I . 2 for t = τ 1 = t n + X and t = τ 2 = τ 1 − Y by using also τ 2 j + 2 = τ 2 − 2 j π and τ 2 j + 1 = τ 1 − 2 j π . The resulting expressions ( I . 29 ) , ( I . 30 ) , ( I . 33 ) – ( I . 36 ) for the matrix coefﬁcients ˆ b i and ˆ m ij appearing in ( 6 . 39 ) are found in this 0 0 , 5 1 1 1 , 05 1 , 1 q = 1 / 5 t sca → c ( t ) / c m i n → 0 0 , 5 1 1 1 , 05 1 , 1 q = 2 / 5 t sca → c ( t ) / c m i n → 0 0 , 5 1 1 1 , 05 1 , 1 q = 3 / 5 t sca → c ( t ) / c m i n → 0 0 , 5 1 1 1 , 05 1 , 1 q = 4 / 5 t sca → c ( t ) / c m i n → κ = 0 . 1 κ = 1 κ = 10 κ = 0 . 1 κ = 1 κ = 10 κ = 0 . 1 κ = 1 κ = 10 κ = 0 . 1 κ = 1 κ = 10 Figure 6 . 8 . Load controlled stationary state , conical indenter . Relative contact radius c ( t ) / c min as function of the scaled time t sca = ( t − t n ) / 2 π for a complete pe - riod t n < t < t n + 1 . The load parameter is here always (cid:96) 1 = 1 / 10 and the material parameters are q = 1 / 5 , 2 / 5 , 3 / 5 , 4 / 5 and κ = 1 / 10 , 1 , 10 . For an elastic mate - rial , the maximal value is always at t sca = 1 / 2 and equal to (cid:112) 1 + 2 (cid:96) 1 . Raising the ordinates to the power 2 / 3 yields the graphs for a parabolic indenter . 58 6 . DYNAMIC LOAD DEPTH SENSING : DECOMPOSITION METHOD Appendix . The results will be used to in the next section to investigate the inﬂuence of the material parameters q and κ on the shape of the contact radius and the time needed to change from a minimum to the next maximum . 6 . 3 . 1 . 1 . Inﬂuence of the parameters , q and κ on the contact radius . Fig . 6 . 8 shows , for twelve different parameter combinations ( q , κ ) , graphs of the contact radius of a conical indenter as function of time during an arbitrary period in the stationary state . The relative size (cid:96) 1 of the sinusoidal perturbations is always 0 . 1 in these graphs . The general features of these graphs are the same as seen earlier in the corresponding plots for depth control . The major difference is , of course , that for a load controlled experiment loss of contact cannot occur as long as the load is positive . For increasing values of q the maximum of the radius shifts to the right of the period , i . e . , in each period the duration of the increasing phase of the contact radius is longer than the duration of the receding phase . This effect also depends on the values of κ as the graphs in Fig . 6 . 9 show . The largest effect occurs again if κ is of order 1 , i . e . , if the physical relaxation time and the period of the actually applied depth function are of the same order of magnitude . Generally , however , it can be concluded that the contact radius reaches its minimum before the depth does . These graphs are actually the same as those from Fig . 6 . 5 as a comparison of the numerical data showed . 10 −1 10 0 10 1 0 . 75 0 . 8 0 . 85 0 . 9 0 . 95 1 κ → ( t n + 1 − t n ) / π q = 1 / 5 q = 2 / 5 q = 3 / 5 q = 4 / 5 Figure 6 . 9 .

Inﬂuence of the material properties of a standard linear solid on the receding time of the contact radius for a sinusoidally perturbed load ( case (cid:96) 1 = 1 / 10 ) . 6 . 4 . Determination of the viscoelastic material parameters ( ﬁnal step ) The Secs . 6 . 2 to 6 . 3 . 1 dealt with ﬁnding the parameterized rep - resentations ( 6 . 24 ) and ( 6 . 46 ) of the contact radius during a typical period of a sinusoidal controlled stationary state . The list of known quantities in these representations contains the independent variable 6 . 4 . DETERMINATION OF THE VISCOELASTIC MATERIAL PARAMETERS 59 Y , ranging from 0 to 2 π , the parameters of the control variable – h = { h max , h 1 } for depth and (cid:96) = { (cid:96) min , (cid:96) 1 } for load control – and , albeit in a somewhat hidden form , the period 2 π / Ω of the actually applied signal as this period serves as a unit of time . The set of material pa - rameters ˜ p present in the hypothesized functional form of the reduced relaxation function φ is not known and only restricted in quite a gen - eral way . To determine the actual value of the material parameters the remaining , as yet unused , experimental data – the function (cid:96) ( t ) if the depth and h ( t ) if the load is controlled – need to be used . The general structure of a ( possible ) set of equations from which ˜ p can be determined numerically is derived next . time t → c o n t a c t r a d i u s c ( t ) → t n t n + 1 t n t n + 1 Figure 6 . 10 . Typical periods of c ( t ) curve for a step shaped , but sinusoidally perturbed , depth or load controlled stationary state . At t = t n , both h and c are maximal whereas at t = t n the load (cid:96) and c are minimal . 6 . 4 . 1 . Controlled depth , measured load . Since , h ( t ) = h max { 1 + h 1 { cos t − 1 } } and depth , contact radius and load have the same ( scaled ) period 2 π in the stationary state , the experimental data for the load in the stationary state can be represented by a truncated Fourier series of the form ¯ a 0 + (cid:80) N (cid:96) k = 1 { ¯ a k cos kt + ¯ b k sin kt } . The set of constants in this series , ¯ a = { ¯ a 0 , . . . , ¯ a N (cid:96) , ¯ b 1 , . . . , ¯ b N (cid:96) } , is ﬁxed by ﬁtting the series to the measured load data ; the approximation ( 6 . 51 ) ¯ (cid:96) ( t , ¯ a ) = ¯ a 0 + N (cid:96) (cid:88) k = 1 { ¯ a k cos kt + ¯ b k sin kt } is used for the load (cid:96) ( t ) . The representation ( 6 . 51 ) implies ¯ (cid:96) ( t , ¯ a ) = ¯ (cid:96) ( t ± t n , ¯ a ) . The parameterized representation ( 6 . 24 ) of the contact ra - dius from Chap . 6 . 2 originated from ’hill’ equations ( 4 . 26 ) and ( 4 . 24 ) . Therefore , the corresponding ’hill’ equations ( 4 . 43 ) and ( 4 . 44 ) are used 60 6 . DYNAMIC LOAD DEPTH SENSING : DECOMPOSITION METHOD for the load : (cid:96) ( τ 0 ) − ∞ (cid:88) k = 1 P k ( τ 0 , R ) = 4 (cid:71) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 + ∞ (cid:88) k = 0 U k ( τ 0 , R ) (cid:33) , τ 0 = τ 0 ( R ) , ( 6 . 52 ) (cid:96) ( τ 1 ) − ∞ (cid:88) k = 1 P k ( τ 1 , R ) = 4 (cid:71) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 + ∞ (cid:88) k = 1 U k ( τ 1 , R ) (cid:33) , τ 1 = τ 1 ( R ) . ( 6 . 53 ) This choice is convenient because the terms on the right - hand sides of ( 6 . 52 ) and ( 6 . 53 ) are already known at this stage . Indeed , com - parison of ( 6 . 11 ) with ( 6 . 16 ) shows that 1 + (cid:80) ∞ 0 U j ( τ 0 ) = b 1 ( Y ) and 1 + (cid:80) ∞ 1 U j ( τ 1 ) = b 2 ( Y ) . Moreover , (cid:71) ( R ) follows from substituting the inverse R = R ( Y ) of ( 6 . 23 ) in the characteristic function (cid:71) . Obviously , as in Chap . 6 . 2 , Y = τ 0 − τ 1 , τ 0 = t n + X ( Y ) and τ 1 = t n + X ( Y ) − Y with t n a multiple of 2 π . Consequently , the load terms on the left - hand sides of ( 6 . 52 ) and ( 6 . 53 ) become (cid:96) ( τ 0 ) ≈ ¯ (cid:96) ( X ( Y ) and (cid:96) ( τ 1 ) ≈ ¯ (cid:96) ( X ( Y ) − Y ) . The sum terms on the left - hand sides of ( 6 . 52 ) and ( 6 . 53 ) , i . e . , P k ( τ i ) = (cid:82) (cid:96) ( s ) T 2 k − 1 ( τ i , s ) d s , with the integration variable ranging from τ 2 k tot τ 2 k − 1 , is rewritten using ¯ (cid:96) for the load and s = τ 2 k + x = τ 0 − 2 k π + x with the new integration variable x now ranging from 0 tot 2 π − Y . As argued in Chap . 6 . 2 , the kernels T 2 k − 1 depend on the new in - tegration variable x and further on Y and ˜ p but not on X . However , since ¯ (cid:96) ( s , ¯ a ) = (cid:96) ( X ( Y , ˜ p ) + x , ¯ a ) , the functions P k and , by extension , the left - hand sides of ( 6 . 52 ) and ( 6 . 53 ) depend on the load constants ¯ a , the material constants ˜ p and the time difference Y . With the shorthand notation ς i + 1 = (cid:96) ( τ i ) − (cid:80) k P k ( τ i ) for i = 0 and 1 , ( 6 . 52 ) and ( 6 . 53 ) , be - come ( 6 . 54 ) (cid:183) ς 1 ( Y , ˜ p , h , ¯ a ) ς 2 ( Y , ˜ p , h , ¯ a ) (cid:184) = 4 (cid:71) ( R ( Y , ˜ p , h ) (cid:183) b 1 ( Y , ˜ p ) b 2 ( Y , ˜ p ) (cid:184) for ∀ Y ∈ ( 0 , 2 π ) . The constants h and ¯ a have a known value and Y ranges from 0 to 2 π . The numerical determination of the material constants ˜ p is a problem of nonlinear parameter identiﬁcation . Indeed , given the depth and and load constants h and ¯ a , respectively , the set of constants ˜ p is to be estimated such that ( 6 . 54 ) is met – exactly or in some other suitable respect – for all values of Y ∈ ( 0 , 2 π ) . 6 . 4 . 2 . Controlled load , measured depth . The equations ( 6 . 54 ) apply to the case of depth control but similar formulae exist for the case of load control . In the latter case , (cid:96) ( t ) = (cid:96) min { 1 − (cid:96) 1 ( cos t − 1 ) } server as control variable , a function with minima at t = t n = 2 n π . The matrix equation ( 6 . 39 ) in Chap . 6 . 3 from which ﬁrst τ 1 = t n + X ( Y ) , τ 2 = t n + X ( Y ) − Y and then the contact radius R = R ( Y ) is calculated is based on ( 6 . 28 ) and ( 6 . 29 ) . Both are ’valley’ equations and it is convenient to use the ’valley’ equations ( 4 . 13 ) and ( 4 . 15 ) connecting depth and 6 . 4 . DETERMINATION OF THE VISCOELASTIC MATERIAL PARAMETERS 61 contact radius for the present purpose , i . e . , h ( τ 1 ) − ∞ (cid:88) k = 1 W k ( τ 1 , R ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 − ∞ (cid:88) k = 1 V k ( τ 1 , R ) (cid:33) , τ 1 = τ 1 ( R ) , ( 6 . 55 ) h ( τ 2 ) − ∞ (cid:88) k = 1 W k ( τ 2 , R ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 − ∞ (cid:88) k = 1 V k ( τ 2 , R ) (cid:33) , τ 2 = τ 2 ( R ) . ( 6 . 56 ) The factors between parentheses on the right - hand sides are already known once the matrix equation ( 6 . 39 ) is established . Indeed , from ( 6 . 33 ) and the right - hand sides of ( 6 . 34 ) and ( 6 . 39 ) , it follows that 1 − (cid:80) k V k ( τ i ) = φ ( ∞ ) ˆ b i ( Y ) for i = t and 2 . The depth data , needed for evaluation of the left - hand sides of ( 6 . 55 ) and ( 6 . 56 ) , are represented by a set of constants , ¯ d = { ¯ d 0 , . . . , ¯ d N h , ¯ e 1 , . . . , ¯ e N h } , generated by ﬁtting the experimental data to a Fourier series : ( 6 . 57 ) h ( t ) ≈ ¯ h ( t , ¯ d ) = ¯ d 0 + N h (cid:88) k = 1 { ¯ d k cos kt + ¯ e k sin kt } . This representation guarantees automatically that h ( τ 1 ) ≈ ¯ h ( X , ¯ d ) and h ( τ 2 ) ≈ ¯ h ( X − Y , ¯ d ) because ¯ h ( t , ¯ d ) = ¯ h ( t − t n , ¯ d ) and t n is a multiple of 2 π . . The sum terms W k ( τ i ) on the left - hand sides of ( 6 . 55 ) and ( 6 . 56 ) equal (cid:82) h ( s ) N 2 k ( τ i , s ) d s and they are rewritten by using ¯ h ( s , ¯ d ) for the depth and by changing the integration variable from s to x via s = τ 2 k + 1 + x . The integration limits of the integrals W k are τ 2 k + 1 = τ 1 − 2 k π and τ 2 k = τ 0 − 2 k π because the system is in a stationary state . There - fore , the new integration variable x ranges from 0 to 2 π − Y and the transformation from s to x changes ¯ h ( s , ¯ d ) to ¯ h ( X ( Y , ˜ p ) + x , ¯ d ) . As in Chap . 6 . 3 , the kernels N 2 k depend on the new integration variable x and further on Y and ˜ p but not on X . The upshot of all these consid - eration is that eventually an equation comparable to ( 6 . 54 ) is found : ( 6 . 58 ) (cid:183) ˆ ς 1 ( Y , ˜ p , (cid:96) , ¯ d ) ˆ ς 2 ( Y , ˜ p , (cid:96) , ¯ d ) (cid:184) = φ ( ∞ ) (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ( Y , ˜ p , (cid:96) ) (cid:183) ˆ b 1 ( Y , ˜ p ) ˆ b 2 ( Y , ˜ p ) (cid:184) for ∀ Y ∈ ( 0 , 2 π ) . The functions ˆ ς i ( i = 1 , 2 ) on the left - hand side are shorthand for h ( τ i ) − (cid:80) k W k ( τ i ) . Note that ( 6 . 58 ) is similar to ( 6 . 54 ) and the way to compute the material constants ˜ p is – apart from obvious differences – expected to be also similar . CHAPTER 7 Conclusions A load depth sensing experiment is characterised by ﬁve functions : the load p ( t ) ; the depth h ( t ) ; the contact radius c ( t ) ; the material function ω ( t ) or its Stieltjes inverse ω i = (cid:36) ( t ) and , ﬁnally , the inden - ter shape function f ( r ) . The shape function f ( r ) is known in advance and later , that is after ﬁnishing an experiment , the data p ( t ) and h ( t ) are also known functions as they are recorded during the experiment . Therefore , two equations are always necessary to obtain a mathemat - ically solvable system , i . e . , two equations that link the data and the indenter shape to the remaining unknowns , which are the contact ra - dius c ( t ) and the material function ω ( t ) , where the determination of the latter function is the ultimate aim of the experiment . 7 . 1 . The link between experimental data , contact size , material properties and indenter shape This link can be described by different but equivalent equations ( see ( 2 . 23a ) to ( 2 . 24b ) in Chap . 2 . 7 . 3 ) . The two most informative ones are an equation relating depth and contact radius , [ L (cid:48) ∗ d ω ] ( r , t ) | r = c ( t ) = [ h ∗ d ω ] ( t ) , ( 7 . 1 ) and an equation connecting load , depth and contact radius , p ( t ) = 4 (cid:110) c ( t ) [ h ∗ d ω ] ( t ) − [ L ∗ d ω ] ( r , t ) | r = c ( t ) (cid:111) . ( 7 . 2 ) They apply to elastic and viscoelastic materials alike . For elastic materials , ω ( t ) = ω E H ( t ) and the depth - contact relation ( 7 . 1 ) implies that h = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ) . As the function (cid:76) (cid:48) is characteristic for the indenter ( see Appendix B ) , the depth - contact relation depends only on the indenter shape . This means that c can be eliminated from ( 7 . 2 ) once and for all in favour of the depth h . Doing so results in the classic load - depth formula for elastic materials : p = 4 ω E (cid:70) ( h ) . Also the func - tion (cid:70) is also characteristic for the indenter ( see Table B . 1 ) . When the substrate is viscoelastic the permanent elimination of the contact radius from the load equation is only possible in two special cases : a strictly advancing or a strictly receding contact from the time the loading is switched on to the current time . 62 7 . 2 . STRICTLY ADVANCING OR RECEDING CONTACT 63 7 . 2 . Strictly advancing or receding contact A contact is strictly advancing if c ( t ) increases or remains constant from the time the experiment started and it recedes if the contact , after an initial jump , decreases afterwards . The equations governing these cases differ in two aspects . The ﬁrst is about the relation between the the depth h and the contact radius c because ( see ( 3 . 1 ) and ( 3 . 6 ) ) h = [ h ∗ d ω ] ∗ d ω i = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ) ⇒ c = (cid:67) ( h ) ( strictly advancing ) , ( 7 . 3 ) [ h ∗ d ω ] ω − 1 = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ) ⇒ c = (cid:67) (cid:181) h ∗ d φ φ (cid:182) ( strictly receding ) . ( 7 . 4 ) If the contact is advancing , the quantity h ∗ d ω must be convoluted with the Stieltjes inverse of ω to obtain (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ) , whereas for a receding contact multiplication by the reciprocal ω − 1 sufﬁces . This difference renders the contact radius for a strictly advancing contact completely inde - pendent of the material function ω whereas a strictly receding contact radius is dependent of the material function – actually only on the reduced relaxation function φ because the initial elastic constant ω 0 drops out of the expression . The second difference is about the rela - tion between the load p and the contact radius c as can be seen from ( 3 . 2 ) and ( 3 . 7 ) , respectively , when written as follows : p ∗ d ω i = 4 { c (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ) − (cid:76) ( c ) } = 4 (cid:71) ( c ) ( strictly advancing ) , ( 7 . 5 ) p ω − 1 = 4 { c (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ) − (cid:76) ( c ) } = 4 (cid:71) ( c ) ( strictly receding ) . ( 7 . 6 ) If the contact strictly advances , p must be convoluted with the Stielt - jes inverse of ω to obtain the right hand side 4 (cid:71) ( c ) but for a receding contact multiplication by de reciprocal ω − 1 sufﬁces . Together , ( 7 . 3 ) , ( 7 . 4 ) , ( 7 . 5 ) and ( 7 . 6 ) show that in both cases the contact radius can be eliminated form the load - depth relation but the ﬁnal formulae differ essentially ; p ∗ d ω i = 4 (cid:70) ( h ) ( strictly advancing ) , ( 7 . 7 ) p ω − 1 = 4 (cid:70) (cid:181) h ∗ d φ φ (cid:182) ( strictly receding ) . ( 7 . 8 ) During a classic relaxation experiment where a step sized depth , i . e . , h ( t ) = h 0 H ( t ) , is prescribed the contact radius is found to be ad - vancing – actually only non - decreasing . As the load response p ( t ) = 4 (cid:70) ( h 0 ) ω ( t ) , this type of experiment can be used to determine the stress relaxation function ω . The contact radius is also increasing during a classic creep experiment , an experiment where step sized load , p ( t ) = p 0 H ( t ) , is applied . The depth response is now according to 4 (cid:70) ( h ( t ) ) = p 0 (cid:36) ( t ) and thus this experiment can be used to measure the creep function (cid:36) = ω i . However , due to practical experimental side effects , like temperature drift and plastic deformation , which accompany in - dentation tests , particularly at low loads and small depths , these test 64 7 . CONCLUSIONS types are not the methods of choice to determine even the initial elas - tic , let alone the long term viscoelastic material properties . 7 . 3 . Distinguishing between initial and long term response The basic equations ( 7 . 1 ) and ( 7 . 2 ) do not change if they are di - vided by ω 0 and the variable (cid:96) ( t ) = p ( t ) / ω 0 and the reduced relaxation function φ ( t ) = ω ( t ) / ω 0 are used . The result is [ L (cid:48) ∗ d φ ] ( r , t ) | r = c ( t ) = [ h ∗ d φ ] ( t ) , ( 7 . 9 ) (cid:96) ( t ) = 4 (cid:110) c ( t ) [ h ∗ d φ ] ( t ) − [ L ∗ d φ ] ( r , t ) | r = c ( t ) (cid:111) . ( 7 . 10 ) This suggests to split the determination of ω in two parts , starting with the ﬁnding of the initial elastic constant ω 0 and proceeding with the determination of the reduced relaxation function φ . 7 . 4 . The initial elastic response constant ω 0 For elastic materials , the normal procedure is to calculate the elas - tic constant ω E from the contact stiffness , i . e . , the slope S = d p / d h = 4 ω E c of the load versus depth curve , taken at the start of the unload section of the graph . As mentioned in Chap . 1 . 1 the slope is addition - ally used to estimate the value of the contact radius from the depth by correcting for plastic deformation . Historically , researchers faced a problem when transferring this method to the viscoelastic realm be - cause in many cases the famous ’nose’ appeared in the curve thus lead - ing to a negative value for the contact stiffness whereas this stiffness must be positive in order to ﬁnd physically acceptable values for the initial elastic response ω 0 . The appearance of a ’nose’ signals that there is a time difference between the occurrence of the maxima of load and depth . While for elastic materials this time difference is al - ways zero – for elastic materials , extrema of load , depth and contact radius are always synchronized – it is quite normal when indenting viscoelastic materials that this time difference is present and often non - negligible as was shown in Chap . 3 . 5 . Although a judicious choice of the testing conditions surely can render the magnitude of this time difference practically zero , there is no need to do so if the experiment is driven in such a way that kinks ( rate jumps ) in the input variable occur . 7 . 5 . The importance of rate jumps for ﬁnding ω 0 . Kinks in the input variable always result in simultaneous kinks in the other variables and essential is that the corresponding rates exhibit jumps here . Rate jumps are always synchronized and it was found in Chap . 3 . 7 that at the jump time T the relation ( 7 . 11 ) 〈 ˙ p 〉 T 〈 ˙ h 〉 T = 4 ω 0 c ( T ) 7 . 6 . THE LONG TERM RESPONSE , : CLASSIC APPROACH AND AN ALTERNATIVE65 applies and this relation is similar to the ’elastic’ relation between the contact stiffness , contact radius and elastic constant Moreover , an es - timate of the contact radius c ( T ) can also be made from the depth h ( T ) by correcting this depth for plastic deformation using the effective in - denter theory ( see Chap . 3 . 7 . 1 and Appendix D ) and the rate jump ratio 〈 ˙ p 〉 T / 〈 ˙ h 〉 T . Thus a procedure for estimating ω 0 that parallels the conventional procedure to ﬁnd ω E for elastic materials is established and the results of de With [ 30 , p . 609 – 610 ] and Ngan and Tang [ 75 ] are corroborated . 7 . 6 . The long term response , : classic approach and an alternative To determine viscoelastic properties , the conventional procedure to asses the frequency dependent storage and loss moduli of the material has several limitations related to the requirement that the contact ra - dius must be increasing at all times . This limits the allowed frequency and / or accuracy ( see Chap . 3 . 4 ) . A completely different approach to ﬁnd φ is through the decompo - sition method for hereditary integrals of [ 39 , p . 63 – 68 ] 1 This method considers the two functions a ( t ) and b ( t ) , which are connected by Stielt - jes convolutions , that is , by a = b ∗ d φ and b = a ∗ d ϕ , but each only known on sets of disjoint , but abutting , intervals ; on any particular interval is either a known and b remains to be determined or it is the other way around . The application of the decomposition method starts from the obser - vation that the equations ( 7 . 9 ) and ( 7 . 10 ) linking depth , contact radius and load are restrictions of the more general set of equations ( 2 . 17 ) and ( 2 . 21 ) – all valid in the whole radius versus time plane – to the curve r = c ( t ) in this plane . The restriction is essentially to the set of surface points currently constituting the edge of the contact region . During dynamic load depth sensing , any particular point at the sub - strate surface might move many times in and out the contact region . Considering the history of such a surface point , it can be said that it moves , metaphorically speaking , along a straight ’road’ – a line of con - stant radius r , say R , to the indenter tip – crossing a mountainous region in the r - t plane ( Fig . 7 . 1 ) . The graph of the contact radius can be envisaged as the ’surface proﬁle of this mountainous region’ and the point moving along the line R = constant is either always above the c ( t ) curve , i . e . , always outside the contact region for large enough values of R , or successively above a ’valley’ , that is : R > c ( t ) , and under a ’hill’ , i . e . , R < c ( t ) . At the intersection times , R equals the current contact radius . It was shown in Chap . 4 . 1 ( see ( 4 . 2 ) and ( 4 . 3 ) and lines preced - ing these equations ) that the general equations mentioned above take 1 A summary of this theory using the notation of this report is found in E . 66 7 . CONCLUSIONS the form (cid:37) c ( r , t ) = [ L (cid:48) ∗ d φ ] ( r , t ) convolution (cid:28) L (cid:48) ( r , t ) = [ (cid:37) c ∗ d ϕ ] ( r , t ) , ( 7 . 12 ) q c ( r , t ) = 4 [ L ∗ d φ ] ( r , t ) convolution (cid:28) 4 L ( r , t ) = [ q c ∗ d ϕ ] ( r , t ) . ( 7 . 13 ) In these equations is L ( r , t ) = L ( r , t ) − rh ( t ) and L (cid:48) ( r , t ) = L (cid:48) ( r , t ) − h ( t ) and each line consists of two hereditary integrals that are related by a convolution because φ and ϕ are each other Stieltjes inverse . When the radius in ( 7 . 12 ) and ( 7 . 13 ) is conﬁned to a constant value R , every set is mathematically as required for the decomposition theorem for hereditary integrals . Indeed , above a ’valley’ (cid:37) c ( R , t ) = 0 and q c ( R , t ) = (cid:96) ( t ) while L (cid:48) ( R , t ) and L ( R , t ) are unknown whereas under a ’hill’ the functions L (cid:48) ( R , t ) and L ( r , t ) are equal to (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) − h ( t ) and (cid:76) ( R ) − Rh ( t ) , respectively , and the unknown functions are now (cid:37) c ( R , t ) and q c ( R , t ) . It is outside the scope of the present section to reiterate all relevant time t radius r line r = R c ( t ) ‘hill’ n ‘valley’ n t 0 t 1 t 2 t 3 Figure 7 . 1 . Numbering of ’hills’ and ’valleys’ and the intersection times . For the current time located below ’hill’ n or above the previous adjoining ’valley’ n , the intersection times run from τ 0 back in time . Note that c ( τ j ) = R for j = 0 , 1 , 2 . . . formulae ; only a general description of the content of Chap . 4 is given below . Decomposition of ( 7 . 12 ) , leads to expressions for h ( τ 2 ) , h ( τ 1 ) and h ( τ 0 ) as sums of integral transforms of h ( s ) and the unit function over all previous ’hill’ intervals ( see Chap . 4 . 3 ) . The factor (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) also enters these equations because R = c ( τ 2 ) = c ( τ 1 ) = c ( τ 0 ) but the load is not present in the ﬁnal results . Similarly , decomposition of ( 7 . 13 ) yields formulae for (cid:96) ( τ 2 ) , (cid:96) ( τ 1 ) and (cid:96) ( τ 0 ) as sums of integral transforms of (cid:96) ( s ) over all previous ’val - ley’ intervals and of the unit function over all previous ’hill’ intervals ( Chap . 4 . 4 and 4 . 5 ) . The value for R is now present through the factor (cid:71) ( R ) but the depth is not . The material behaviour determines the kernels of these integral transforms , ﬁrstly because the kernel functions N j ( t , s ) and T j ( t , s ) are recursively deﬁned using ˙ ϕ ( t − s ) and ˙ φ ( t − s ) as starting functions and , secondly , because it is used in the recursion itself ( see ( E . 15 ) and ( E . 16 ) 7 . 7 . THE LONG TERM RESPONSE : DYNAMIC LOAD - DEPTH SENSING 67 for the N j and ( E . 11 ) and ( E . 10 ) for the T j kernels ) . Additionally the kernels also depend on the intersection times τ 0 , τ 1 , . . . . In view of the nature of the recursive formulae plus the fact that the functions ˙ ϕ and ˙ φ depend only through t − s on t and s it is known at a general level – that is , without more speciﬁc information about the behaviour of φ – how the kernels depend on the intersection times τ j , and the transformation variable s ( see Chap . 4 . 7 ) . Obviously , more detailed information about the kernels becomes available if the mathematical form , the reduced relaxation function is assumed to have , is speciﬁed in more detail . For example , if a material behaves according to the standard linear element , closed form expressions for the kernels exist and were derived in Appendix F . 1 . Often , the hypothesis is that the reduced relaxation function is a Prony series ( F . 2 ) . It was shown in F . 2 . 2 that all kernels are sums of exponentials with recursively deﬁned coefﬁcients . The value of the decomposition method of [ 39 ] is primarily suited for two types of indentation experiments . The ﬁrst is the case of a sin - gle load and unload , the case n = 1 , and it is shown in Chap . 5 how the decomposition results can be applied to this experiment and the reduced relaxation function be calculated from the experimental data . The results were applied to the case of ’standard linear element’ ma - terial behaviour for a prescribed depth linearly increasing and later linearly decreasing with speeds v 1 and − v 2 , respectively . The second is the situation described in Chap . 6 , where a sinusoidal perturba - tion is superposed on a step shaped depth or load and the system has reached a stationary state . The actual execution of the latter type of experiment is the same as for classic dynamic load - depth sensing but the processing of the results is different . The basic difference is that every decomposed equation connects either depth and radius R or load and radius R . Processing of the data now always involves an interme - diate step , namely the determination of R as function of the control data , and the results of this step is ﬁnally combined with the remain - ing data to calculate the material constants one is looking for . 7 . 7 . The long term response : dynamic load - depth sensing The application of the decomposition method to dynamic load - depth sensing uses that in the stationary state the maxima of the contact radius and the depth occur simultaneously , whereas minima of the contact radius coincide in time with the minima of the load This is schematically shown in Fig . 7 . 2 , . Moreover , at the time , t n , where the contact radius is maximal , the relation between c and h is momentar - ily the same as for an advancing contact : h ( t n ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t n ) ) or , equiva - lently , c ( t n ) = (cid:67) ( h ( t n ) ) . At the time t n of a minimum in the contact radius , matters are more complicated because the relation between c 68 7 . CONCLUSIONS and (cid:96) also involves the asymptotic value φ ( ∞ ) : (cid:96) ( t n ) / φ ( ∞ ) = 4 (cid:71) ( c ( t n ) ) . time t → ℓ ( t ) , c ( t ) a nd h ( t ) ← t n − 1 ← t n ← t n ← t n + 1 h ( t ) c ( t ) ℓ ( t ) Figure 7 . 2 . Qualitative picture of the shapes of depth , contact radius and load . At the times t = . . . t n − 1 , t n , . . . the maxima of h ( t ) and c ( t ) coincide . At the times t = . . . , t n , t n + 1 , . . . the minima of c ( t ) and (cid:96) ( t ) conicide . For a depth controlled stationary state , i . e . , a prescribed depth ac - cording to 2 ( 7 . 14 ) h ( t ) = h max { 1 + h 1 ( cos t − 1 ) } , 0 ≤ h 1 < 1 , it is shown in Chap . 6 . 2 that a matrix equation of the following type ( 7 . 15 ) h 1 (cid:183) m 11 ( Y ; ˜ p ) m 12 ( Y ; ˜ p ) m 21 ( Y ; ˜ p ) m 22 ( Y ; ˜ p ) (cid:184)(cid:183) sin ( X ) cos ( X ) (cid:184) = (cid:65) ( R , c max , h 1 ) (cid:183) b 1 ( Y ; ˜ p ) b 2 ( Y ; ˜ p ) (cid:184) . governs the descending part of any period of the contact radius . The parameter ˜ p in ( 7 . 15 ) indicates the set of material constants appearing in the ( assumed ) mathematical form of φ . The independent variable Y = τ 0 − τ 1 ranges from 0 to 2 π because the periods of the contact radius is the same as that of the depth . The independent variable X = τ 0 − t n 2 The period of the actually prescribed sinusoidal perturbation is taken as the unit of time and relaxation times present in the material behaviour are also scaled by this time unit . So , the depth function ( 7 . 14 ) has frequency 1 . 7 . 7 . THE LONG TERM RESPONSE : DYNAMIC LOAD - DEPTH SENSING 69 follows from ( 7 . 15 ) , as shown by ( 6 . 22 ) . It ranges from 0 to t n + 1 − t n when Y ranges from 0 to 2 π and X depends on ˜ p but not on R and also not on the depth parameters h max and h 1 . So , X = X ( Y ; ˜ p ) , implying that the phase shift π − X ( 2 π ; ˜ p ) between depth and load depends only on ˜ p . After elimination of X in favour of Y with X ( Y , ˜ p ) in ( 7 . 15 ) , the solution of the resulting equation yields R ( Y ; ˜ p , h ) , i . e . , a description of the contact radius as function of Y , ˜ p and the depth parameters h = { h max , h 1 } . To determine the magnitudes of the material constants in the set ˜ p , the remaining equations , those for the load in this case , need to be used . This again leads to a matrix equation of the following type : ( 7 . 16 ) (cid:183) ς 1 ( Y ; ˜ p , h , ¯ a ) ς 2 ( Y ; ˜ p , h , ¯ a ) (cid:184) = 4 (cid:71) ( R ( Y ; ˜ p , h ) (cid:183) b 1 ( Y ; ˜ p ) b 2 ( Y ; ˜ p ) (cid:184) for ∀ Y ∈ ( 0 , 2 π ) . The components ς 1 and ς 2 are shorthand for (cid:96) ( τ 1 ) − (cid:80) k P k ( τ 1 ) and (cid:96) ( τ 2 ) − (cid:80) k P k ( τ 2 ) , respectively . The load data (cid:96) ( t ) present in these com - ponents are assumed to be approximated by a truncated Fourier series and ¯ a indicates the parameter set of the Fourier coefﬁcients . The nu - merical computation of the constants in ˜ p is a nonlinear parameter identiﬁcation problem . If , instead of the depth , the load is controlled according to (cid:96) ( t ) = (cid:96) min { 1 − (cid:96) 1 ( cost − 1 ) } , it was shown in Chap . 6 . 3 that again a matrix equation of the same type as ( 7 . 15 ) exists . However , now is Y the dif - ference τ 1 − τ 2 ( see Fig . 6 . 7 ) and X = τ 1 − t n . If Y = 0 also X = 0 , that is τ 1 = τ 2 = t n , and X = t n − t n , i . e . , τ 1 = t n if Y = 2 π . So , this case de - scribes the ascending part of an arbitrary period and the analysis now utilizes – as shown in Fig . 7 . 2 – the coincidence of the minima of load and the contact radius . As the solution for X is again a function of Y and ˜ p only ; the phase shift π − X ( 2 π , ˜ p ) depends only on ˜ p . Compared to the depth controlled case , the construction of the contact radius dif - fers somewhat because the relation between the minima of contact and load depends on the asymptotic value φ ( ∞ ) . The computation of the material constants in ˜ p is again a non - linear parameter identiﬁcation problem . For SLS - material behaviour , φ ( t ) = 1 + q { exp ( − κ t ) − 1 } , and the in - ﬂuence of the material parameters q and κ ( Chap . 6 . 2 . 1 and 6 . 3 . 1 ) on the contact radius was investigated for depth and load control , respec - tively . Generally it was found that in any period of the stationary state the duration of the receding phase of the contact is smaller than that of the advancing phase and this effect occurs for both sinusoidal depth or load control . Moreover , this difference in duration times depends only on the material properties and the frequency of the applied con - trol – it does not matter whether the depth or the load is controlled . This difference is largest if the period of the control variable is of the 70 7 . CONCLUSIONS same order of magnitude as the time scale present in the reduced re - laxation function . If the experiment is depth controlled , this difference in duration times may lead to loss of contact , i . e . , c = 0 without fully retracted indenter ( h > 0 ) , if the amplitude of the perturbation is too large compared to the size of the carrier step . APPENDIX A Stieltjes convolution The most important parts of the extensive paper written by Gurtin and Sternberg [ 52 ] are summarized here . A function f is in Heaviside class H N if it is zero for t ∈ ( −∞ , 0 ) and of class C N for t ∈ [ 0 , ∞ ) . The material functions λ and µ are assumed to be in H 2 , whereas the depth h and the load p are , at least , in H 0 . For f ∈ H 0 and g ∈ H 1 , the Stieltjes integral (cid:82) t −∞ f ( t − τ ) d g ( τ ) is called the Stieltjes convolution of f and g and it is written down as f ∗ d g ; in full ( A . 1 ) [ f ∗ d g ] ( t ) =   0 t < 0 , g ( 0 + ) f ( t ) + t (cid:82) 0 + f ( t − τ ) ˙ g ( τ ) d τ t ≥ 0 . The integral on the right - hand side of ( A . 1 ) is the conventional convo - lution usually denoted by the (cid:63) symbol only ; so f ∗ d g = g 0 f + f (cid:63) ˙ g for t > 0 . The Stieltjes inverse of f is a function k such that [ f ∗ d k ] equals the Heaviside step function H ( t ) and it is denoted by f i . For f ∈ H 2 a necessary and sufﬁcient condition that f i exists is that f 0 (cid:54) = 0 . Let g ∈ H 0 and f and k ∈ H 1 then g ∗ d f ∈ H 0 and f ∗ d k ∈ H 1 and the most important properties are • g ∗ d f = f ∗ d g and g ∗ dH = g , • g ∗ d ( f ∗ d k ) = ( g ∗ d f ) ∗ d k and g ∗ d ( f + k ) = g ∗ d f + g ∗ d k , • g ∗ d f = 0 ∀ t implies f = 0 ∀ t or g = 0 ∀ t , • ( f ∗ d k ) i = f i ∗ d k i provided f i and k i exist . Consider g ∈ H 0 and f at least in H 2 . Differentiation of g ∗ d f gives d d t [ g ∗ d f ] ( t ) = f 0 ˙ g ( t ) + ˙ f 0 g ( t ) + [ g (cid:63) ¨ f ] ( t ) t > 0 , ( A . 2 ) or , alternatively d d t [ g ∗ d f ] ( t ) = f 0 ˙ g ( t ) + g 0 ˙ f ( t ) + [ ˙ g (cid:63) ˙ f ] ( t ) t > 0 . ( A . 3 ) The last two terms in ( A . 2 ) – also equal to g ∗ d ˙ f – are continuous for t > 0 , so jumps in ˙ g lead to jumps in the derivative of g ∗ d f . Take in ( A . 3 ) for f a reduced relaxation function and for g the cor - responding creep function , i . e . , g = f i such that f ∗ d f i = H . Equation 71 72 A .

The depth h , the load p , the radius c and u (cid:48) are con - tinuous functions of time , but they might exhibit rate jumps at some time , say T , i . e . , they are piecewise differentiable but the left and right limits of the rates exist at T . Since h ∗ d ˙ ω is still continuous for t > 0 , application of ( A . 2 ) shows that the rate jump of h ∗ d ω at time T is ( C . 1 ) 〈 d d t [ h ∗ d ω ] 〉 T = ω 0 〈 ˙ h 〉 T . Analogously , as L ( c ( t ) , t ) = (cid:76) ( c ( t ) ) , L (cid:48) ( c ( t ) , t ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t ) ) , the continuity of L ∗ d ˙ ω and that of L (cid:48) ∗ d ˙ ω for t > 0 shows 〈 d d t [ L ∗ d ω ] 〉 T ( r ) | r = c ( T ) = 〈 ˙ c 〉 T [ L (cid:48) ∗ d ω ] ( r , T ) | r = c ( T ) , ( C . 2 ) 〈 d d t [ L (cid:48) ∗ d ω ] 〉 T ( r ) | r = c ( T ) = 〈 ˙ c 〉 T [ L (cid:48)(cid:48) ∗ d ω ] ( r , T ) | r = c ( T ) . ( C . 3 ) Next , consider the inﬂuence of a rate jump on the second of ( 2 . 17 ) , i . e . , on ( C . 4 ) ϑ c ( r , t ) = θ ( r , t ) H ( c ( t ) − r ) = 2 π [ { L (cid:48) − h } ∗ d ω ] ( r , t ) . Take r < c ( T ) but ﬁxed and note that due to the continuity of c at T , there exists a small positive number , say δ ( 0 < δ (cid:191) 1 ) , such that r < c ( t ) , for T − δ T ≤ t ≤ T + δ T . Consequently , H ( c ( t ) − r ) = 1 and ϑ c = θ in this time range and thus the rate jump of θ ( r , t ) , the left - hand side of ( C . 4 ) , becomes ( C . 5 ) 〈 ∂ϑ c ∂ t 〉 T ( r ) = 〈 ˙ θ 〉 T ( r ) for r < c ( T ) . For the given value of r and the indicated time range is L (cid:48) ( r , t ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( r ) and thus ˙ L (cid:48) ( r , t ) = 0 . The jump in the time derivative of the right - hand side of ( C . 4 ) is therefore ( C . 6 ) 2 π 〈 ∂ ∂ t [ { L (cid:48) − h } ∗ d ω ] 〉 T ( r ) = − 2 πω 0 〈 ˙ h 〉 T for r < c ( T ) . and hence ( C . 7 ) 〈 ˙ θ 〉 T ( r ) = − 2 π ω 0 〈 ˙ h 〉 T . As the right - hand side of this equation is independent of r , the rate jumps in θ ( r , t ) are also independent of r up to and including c ( T ) . 74 C . RATE JUMP CONDITIONS 75 Differentiation of the identity θ ( c ( t ) , t ) = 0 with respect to time gives ( C . 8 ) ˙ c ( t ) θ (cid:48) ( c ( t ) , t ) = − ˙ θ ( c ( t ) , t ) with θ (cid:48) ( c ( t ) , t ) = lim r ↑ c ( t ) θ (cid:48) ( r , t ) because θ is only deﬁned for r ≤ c ( t ) . As θ ( r , t ) is a continuous function of time – the jumps are only in the rates – it follows that θ (cid:48) ( r , t ) is also continuous in time and this includes the limit r ↑ c ( t ) . Then from ( C . 8 ) a jump condition at t = T can be constructed , reading ( C . 9 ) 〈 ˙ c 〉 T θ (cid:48) ( c ( T ) , T ) = −〈 ˙ θ 〉 T ( c ( T ) ) . Together ( C . 7 ) and ( C . 9 ) combine to ( C . 10 ) ω 0 〈 ˙ h 〉 T 〈 ˙ c 〉 T = π 2 θ (cid:48) ( c ( T ) , T ) Analogously , from the ﬁrst equation of ( 2 . 24 ) with the aid of ( 2 . 23 ) , ( C . 1 ) and ( C . 3 ) the following jump condition for the loading rate can be derived ( C . 11 ) 〈 ˙ p 〉 T 〈 ˙ h 〉 T = 4 ω 0 c ( T ) APPENDIX D Effective indenter theory for viscoelastic materials The same assumptions as for the elastic case are used and the anal - ysis applies to a situation where the contact radius at the jump time T exceeds all previous values , i . e . , in this period the contact radius is assumed to be increasing . The pertinent load equation is now the ﬁrst of ( 3 . 2 ) , i . e . , [ p e ∗ d (cid:36) ] ( T ) = 4 { c e ( T ) h e ( T ) − (cid:76) e ( c e ( T ) ) } , and for the same reason h e ( T ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) e ( c e ( T ) ) . The requirement that the ’effective indenter’ shape , f e ( r ) is a power law can be weakened to the requirement that f e is a positively homogeneous function , say of degree n , of r . This leads to (cid:76) e ( r ) = r n + 1 (cid:76) e ( 1 ) , r (cid:76) (cid:48) e ( r ) / ( n + 1 ) = (cid:76) e ( r ) and to (cid:76) (cid:48) e ( yc e ( T ) ) = y n h e ( T ) . These relations and (cid:36) = ϕ / ω 0 show that ( D . 1 ) [ p e ∗ d ϕ ] ( T ) = 4 ω 0 c e ( T ) nh e ( T ) n + 1 = 〈 ˙ p e 〉 T 〈 ˙ h e 〉 T nh e ( T ) n + 1 Substitution of the second of ( 2 . 17 ) in ( 2 . 13 ) with the result taken for t = T and r = c ( T ) , results in ( D . 2 ) u e ( c e ( T ) , T ) = 2 π (cid:90) c e ( T ) 0 (cid:76) (cid:48) ( x ) − h e ( T ) (cid:113) c 2e ( T ) − x 2 d x = − k n h e ( T ) , with ( D . 3 ) with k n = (cid:110) 2 π (cid:90) 1 0 1 − y n (cid:112) 1 − y 2 d y (cid:111) . Combination of ( D . 1 ) and ( D . 2 ) leads to ( D . 4 ) u e ( c e ( T ) , T ) = − ε n [ p e ∗ d ϕ ] ( T ) 〈 ˙ h e 〉 T 〈 ˙ p e 〉 T with ε n = k n { 1 + 1 n } . The experimental value for the rate jump ratio implies c e ( T ) = c ( T ) and with the experimental data for the load in ( D . 4 ) , this leads to the intermediate result that ( D . 5 ) u e ( c ( T ) , T ) = − ε n [ p ∗ d ϕ ] ( T ) 〈 ˙ h 〉 T 〈 ˙ p 〉 T . Finally , with the assumption u ( c ( T ) , T ) = u e ( c ( T ) , T ) and because in the actual experiment the contact depth always equals h ( t ) + u ( c ( t ) , t ) , 76 D . EFFECTIVE INDENTER THEORY FOR VISCOELASTIC MATERIALS 77 ( D . 5 ) results in h c ( T ) = h ( T ) − ε n p ( T ) 〈 ˙ h 〉 T 〈 ˙ p 〉 T R ( T ) ( D . 6 ) with the function R deﬁned by R ( T ) = 1 + (cid:90) T 0 p ( τ ) p ( T ) ˙ ϕ ( T − τ ) d τ . ( D . 7 ) APPENDIX E Decomposing hereditary integrals This appendix is completely based on the theory of Golden and Gra - ham [ 39 , p . 63 – 67 ] for the problem mentioned in Chap . 4 . 1 . Two continuous and causal functions a ( t ) and b ( t ) are related by a = b ∗ d φ and b = a ∗ d ϕ with – obviously – φ ∗ d ϕ = H . Peculiar is that the functions a and b are only known on sets of disjoint , but abut - ting , intervals ; on any particular interval is either a known and b re - mains to be determined or it is the other way around . This is shown in Fig . E . 1 and it is assumed – no loss of generality involved here – that in the ﬁrst interval a is given and b is to be determined here . The intervals where a is known are the grayed intervals in Fig . E . 1 and they are numbered starting at the ﬁrst from the left and identiﬁed by the tuples ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 1 ) , ( 3 . 1 ) , . . . etcetera . On the other intervals , the non - greyed ones in this picture , is b given and a to be determined and these intervals are also numbered starting at the ﬁrst from the left and these intervals are identiﬁed by ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 2 , 2 ) , . . . and so on . The numbering of time grayed intervals : a ( t ) : known , b ( t ) : unknown a = b = 0 t 3 t 2 t 1 t 0 interval ( n - 1 , 2 ) interval ( 1 , 2 ) interval ( 2 , 2 ) current time t t 2n - 1 t 2n - 2 t 2n - 3 t 2n = 0 time t 3 t 2 t 1 t 0 interval ( n , 1 ) interval ( n - 1 , 1 ) interval ( 1 , 1 ) interval ( 2 , 1 ) current time t t 2n - 1 t 2n - 2 t 2n - 3 t 2n = 0 interval ( n , 2 ) non - grayed intervals : b ( t ) : known , a ( t ) : unknown a = b = 0 Figure E . 1 . Time axes for two different cases of the current time t . the interval boundaries times depends on the interval where the cur - rent time is located . Generally , the current time is in any of the union of two adjacent interval types : t ∈ { Interval ( n , 1 ) ∪ Interval ( n , 2 ) } and the value of n determines the numbering of the boundary times . As shown in Fig . E . 1 , it starts at the upper boundary of Interval ( n , 2 ) , i . e . , at τ 0 and proceeds subsequently backwards in time as τ 1 , τ 2 , . . . until the origin of the time axis , τ 2 n = 0 , is reached . So , the numbering de - pends on n but the actual time values do not because τ j ( n ) = τ j + 2 ( n + 1 ) . 78 E . 1 . CURRENT TIME BETWEEN τ 1 ( n ) AND τ 0 ( n ) 79 Depending on the interval type the current time is located in , one of the following two equations is the starting point : a ( t ) = b ( t ) + (cid:90) t 0 b ( τ ) ˙ φ ( t − τ ) d τ if current time t ∈ Interval ( n , 2 ) , ( E . 1 ) or b ( t ) = a ( t ) + (cid:90) t 0 a ( τ ) ˙ ϕ ( t − τ ) d τ if current time t ∈ Interval ( n , 1 ) . ( E . 2 ) E . 1 . Current time between τ 1 ( n ) and τ 0 ( n ) Rewrite the starting equation ( E . 1 ) as ( E . 3 ) a ( t ) = b ( t ) + t (cid:90) τ 1 ( n ) ˙ φ ( t − s ) b ( s ) d s + τ 1 ( n ) (cid:90) 0 ˙ φ ( t − s ) b ( s ) d s and use ( E . 2 ) to obtain ( E . 4 ) a ( t ) = b ( t ) + t (cid:90) τ 1 ( n ) ˙ φ ( t − s ) b ( s ) d s + τ 1 ( n ) (cid:90) 0 ˙ φ ( t − s ) (cid:110) a ( s ) + s (cid:90) 0 ˙ ϕ ( s − u ) a ( u ) d u (cid:111) d s . Interchange the order of integration of the double integral and deﬁne ( E . 5 ) T 0 ( t , s ) = ˙ φ ( t − s ) and ( E . 6 ) T 1 ( t , τ , n ) = T 0 ( t , s ) + τ 1 ( n ) (cid:90) s T 0 ( t , u ) ˙ ϕ ( u − s ) d u , to arrive at ( E . 7 ) a ( t ) = b ( t ) + t (cid:90) τ 1 ( n ) T 0 ( t , s ) b ( s ) d s + τ 1 ( n ) (cid:90) 0 T 1 ( t , s , n ) a ( s ) d s . If n = 1 the analysis ends here because the a and b functions occurring in the right - hand side of ( E . 7 ) are known for all time values occurring here . Note that ( E . 7 ) is ( E . 3 ) but merely written in a different way . So , comparison of the two expressions shows that ( E . 8 ) τ 1 ( n ) (cid:90) 0 T 1 ( t , s , n ) a ( s ) d s = τ 1 ( n ) (cid:90) 0 T 0 ( t , s , n ) b ( s ) d s , τ 1 ( n ) < t < τ 0 ( n ) . 80 E . DECOMPOSING HEREDITARY INTEGRALS For n ≥ 2 the analysis proceeds in the same vein and leads eventu - ally to ( E . 9 ) a ( t ) = b ( t ) + t (cid:90) τ 1 ( n ) T 0 ( t , s ) b ( s ) d s + n (cid:88) k = 1 τ 2 k − 1 ( n ) (cid:90) τ 2 k ( n ) T 2 k − 1 ( t , s , n ) a ( s ) d s + n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 τ 2 k ( n ) (cid:90) τ 2 k + 1 ( n ) T 2 k ( t , s , n ) b ( s ) d s n ≥ 2 . So , the functions T j start with T 0 ( t , s , n ) = ˙ φ ( t − s ) and are generated for odd subscripts according to ( E . 10 ) T 2 k + 1 ( t , s , n ) = T 2 k ( t , s , n ) + τ 2 k + 1 ( n ) (cid:90) s T 2 k ( t , u , n ) ˙ ϕ ( u − s ) d u k = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . For even subscripts ( E . 11 ) T 2 k ( t , s , n ) = T 2 k − 1 ( t , s , n ) + τ 2 k ( n ) (cid:90) s T 2 k − 1 ( t , u , n ) ˙ φ ( u − s ) d u k = 1 , 2 , . . . E . 2 . Current time between τ 2 ( n ) and τ 1 ( n ) Here , the function a is known and b is to determined and the start - ing point is now ( E . 2 ) written as ( E . 12 ) b ( t ) = a ( t ) + t (cid:90) τ 2 ( n ) ˙ ϕ ( t − s ) a ( s ) d s + τ 2 ( n ) (cid:90) 0 ˙ ϕ ( t − s ) (cid:110) b ( s ) + s (cid:90) 0 ˙ φ ( s − u ) b ( u ) d u (cid:111) d s . If n = 1 the second integral is not present and , with the deﬁnition N 1 ( t , s ) = ˙ ϕ ( t − τ ) , one has ( E . 13 ) b ( t ) = a ( t ) + t (cid:90) 0 N 1 ( t , s ) a ( s ) d s E . 3 . THE TIME DERIVATIVES OF THE FUNCTIONS T j , N j 81 With basically the same procedure as before one ﬁnds for n ≥ 2 : ( E . 14 ) b ( t ) = a ( t ) + t (cid:90) τ 2 ( n ) N 1 ( t , s ) a ( s ) d s + n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 τ 2 k ( n ) (cid:90) τ 2 k + 1 ( n ) N 2 k ( t , s , n ) b ( s ) d s + n − 1 (cid:88) k = 1 τ 2 k + 1 ( n ) (cid:90) τ 2 k + 2 ( n ) N 2 k + 1 ( t , s , n ) a ( s ) d s n ≥ 2 . The functions N j start with N 1 ( t , s , n ) = ϕ ( t − s ) and for even subscripts ( E . 15 ) N 2 k ( t , s , n ) = N 2 k − 1 ( t , s , n ) + τ 2 k ( n ) (cid:90) s N 2 k − 1 ( t , u , n ) ˙ φ ( u − s ) d u k = 1 , 2 , . . . , and for odd subscripts ( E . 16 ) N 2 k + 1 ( t , s , n ) = N 2 k ( t , s , n ) + τ 2 k + 1 ( n ) (cid:90) s N 2 k ( t , u , n ) ˙ ϕ ( u − s ) d u k = 1 , 2 , . . . E . 3 . The time derivatives of the functions T j , N j Inspection of the deﬁnitions of T j ( t , s , n ) and N j ( t , s , n ) shows that the partial derivatives to the ﬁrst time argument obey the same trans - formation rules as the functions itself . With ( E . 17 ) ˙ T j ( t , s , n ) = ∂ T j ( t , s , n ) ∂ t and ˙ N j ( t , s , n ) = ∂ N j ( t , s , n ) ∂ t , As , obviously , ˙ T 0 ( t , s , n ) = ¨ φ ( t − s ) it follows that for odd subscripts the derivatives are generated according to ( E . 18 ) ˙ T 2 k + 1 ( t , s , n ) = ˙ T 2 k ( t , s , n ) + τ 2 k + 1 ( n ) (cid:90) s ˙ T 2 k ( t , u , n ) ˙ ϕ ( u − s ) d u k = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . , and for even subscripts according to ( E . 19 ) ˙ T 2 k ( t , s , n ) = ˙ T 2 k − 1 ( t , s , n ) + τ 2 k ( n ) (cid:90) s ˙ T 2 k − 1 ( t , u , n ) ˙ φ ( u − s ) d u k = 1 , 2 , . . . 82 E .

The creep function is the elon - gation u if a step in the load is applied . The two conﬁguration shown in Fig .

First of all ( F . 4 ) T 0 ( t , s ) = ˙ φ ( t − s ) = − q κ exp { − κ ( t − s ) } and application of the deﬁning formulae ( E . 11 ) and ( E . 10 ) shows that ( F . 5 ) T 1 ( t , s , R , n ) = − q κ exp { κτ 1 } exp { − κ ( t − ( 1 − q ) s ) } , 1 In a different form , these results , were derived earlier by Golden and Graham [ 38 ] . 83 84 F .

( F . 7 ) The T j functions with even subscript are related by ( F . 8 ) T 2 k + 2 ( t , s , R , n ) = T 2 k ( t , s , R , n ) exp (cid:179) q κ ( τ 2 k + 1 − τ 2 k + 2 ) with k = 0 , 1 , . . . , n − 2 . For those with odd subscripts the relations ( F . 9 ) T 2 k + 1 ( t , s , R , n ) = T 2 k − 1 ( t , s , R , n ) exp (cid:179) − q κ ( τ 2 k − τ 2 k + 1 ) (cid:180) apply for k = 1 , 2 , . . . . For even subscripts it is found that eventually ( F . 10 ) T 2 k ( t , s , R , n ) = T 0 ( t , s ) exp { q κγ 2 k ( R , n ) } k = 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . , n − 1 with γ 2 k only dependent on the sequence τ 1 , . . . , τ 2 k .

Note that γ 2 k > 0 because ( F . 12 ) − 2 k (cid:88) j = 1 ( − 1 ) j τ j = τ 1 − τ 2 + τ 3 − τ 4 ··· + τ 2 k − 1 − τ 2 k > 0 , on account of the properties of the τ j - sequence ( F . 3 ) . Similarly , for the odd subscripts the following results apply ( F . 13 ) T 2 k + 1 ( t , s , R , n ) = T 0 ( t , s ) exp { q κ ( γ 2 k + 1 ( R , n ) − s ) } k = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . The sequence of N j functions starts with ( F . 14 ) N 1 ( t , s ) = ˙ ϕ ( t − s ) = q κ exp { − ( 1 − q ) κ ( t − s ) } . The next function in the N j sequence is ( F . 15 ) N 2 ( t , s , R , n ) = q κ exp { − ( 1 − q ) κ t + κ s − q κτ 2 ( R , n ) } . The N j functions with odd subscripts are related by ( F . 16 ) N 2 k + 1 ( t , s , R , n ) = N 2 k − 1 ( t , s , R , n ) exp ( q κ ( τ 2 k + 1 ( R , n ) − τ 2 k ( R , n ) ) ) for the k - values 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . whereas the N j functions with even sub - scripts satisfy ( F . 17 ) N 2 k + 2 ( t , s , R , n ) = N 2 k ( t , s , R , n ) exp ( − q κ ( τ 2 k + 2 ( R , n ) − τ 2 k + 1 ( R , n ) ) ) , and this expression is valid for k = 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . . For k = 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . , the N j functions with odd subscript are ( F . 18 ) N 2 k + 1 ( t , s , R , n ) = N 1 ( t , s ) exp (cid:161) q κ ( γ 2 k + 1 ( R , n ) − τ 1 ( R , n ) ) (cid:162) , and those with even subscript ( F . 19 ) N 2 k ( t , s , R , n ) = N 1 ( t , s ) exp { q κ ( γ 2 k ( R , n ) − τ 1 ( R , n ) + s ) } .

Often , viscoelastic media are described by discrete spectrum models with the relaxation and creep function represented by Prony series . For the reduced relaxation and creep function , this means that they are written as φ ( t ) = ω ( t ) ω 0 = 1 + M (cid:88) i = 1 q i { exp ( − κ i t ) − 1 } , ( F . 20 ) ϕ ( t ) = (cid:36) ( t ) (cid:36) 0 = 1 − M (cid:88) i = 1 w i { exp ( − γ i t ) − 1 } . ( F . 21 ) All parameters must be positive and also 0 < φ ( ∞ ) = 1 − (cid:80) q i < 1 . As φ ( t ) and ϕ ( t ) must each others Stieltjes inverse , the parameter set { w i , γ i } is a function of the set { q j , κ j } and vice versa . Golden et al . [ 40 ] derived formulae for the relations between the constants in two Prony series with the property that they are each others Stieltjes inverses . Adapting their results shows that the two parameter sets { w i , γ i } and { q j , κ j } are related by the 2 M equations M (cid:88) i = 1 κ i q i κ i − γ k = 1 , γ k w k M (cid:88) i = 1 κ i q i ( κ i − γ k ) 2 = 1 , k = 1 , 2 , . . . , M , ( F . 22 ) or , alternatively , by M (cid:88) i = 1 γ i w i κ k − γ i = 1 , κ k q k M (cid:88) i = 1 γ i w i ( κ k − γ i ) 2 = 1 , k = 1 , 2 , . . . , M .

The deﬁnition Q ( 1 ) j ( t − τ 1 ) = − b j (cid:80) i a i exp { − κ i ( t − τ 1 ) } / ( κ i − γ j ) reveals that T 1 is again a Prony series in the variable τ 1 − s .

APPENDIX G Crossing local extrema of the contact radius One of the problems in the Golden and Graham method [ 39 ] is that the number of ’hills’ and ’valleys’ including the associated numbering of the intersection times τ j ( R , n ) and the mathematical form of T j and N j might depend strongly on the actual value of the considered radius R . This is graphically demonstrated in Fig . G . 1 where along the line time t radius r c ( t ) r = R 2 r = R 3 r = R 1 t = t 0 ( R 1 , 1 ) t = t 0 ( R 2 , 2 ) t = t 0 ( R 3 , 1 ) t 1 ( R 2 , 2 ) t 1 ( R 1 , 1 ) t 2 ( R 2 , 2 ) t 3 ( R 2 , 2 ) t 1 ( R 3 , 1 ) A B Figure G . 1 . Contact radius , lines of constant radius and intersection times . r = R 1 only one ’valley’ and one ’hill’ is encountered in the time range 0 ≤ t ≤ τ 0 ( R 1 , 1 ) and the situation is similar along the line r = R 3 for 0 ≤ t ≤ τ 0 ( R 3 , 1 ) although the ’hill’ is in the latter case not a simple one . One the other hand , the line r = R 2 – a line below the local maximum A but above the local minimum B – cuts through two ’valleys’ and two ’hills’ on the time interval [ 0 , τ 0 ( R 2 , 2 ) ] . Consequently , if the line r = R = moves from zero to a large value ’valleys’ and ’hills’ might originate , disappear or coalesce in quite a complicated manner if local extrema are crossed in the process . The functions U k , V k , H k , W k , P k and Q k , introduced in Chap . 4 are integral operators with the T j or the N j functions as kernel and the mathematical form of these functions also depends 1 on the value of the radius R . For even indices these functions are deﬁned below a ’hill’ and for odd indices they are deﬁned above a ’valley’ . Consequently , if , for example , a ’valley’ disappears and the adjacent ’hills’ coalesce one would expect that the associated T j and N j functions also disappear or coalesce . To see whether this expectation is correct consider the following problem . The starting point is shown in the top of Fig . G . 2 . Let A ( t , s ) 1 To simplify the notation this dependence is in this section only implied . 88 G .

Disappearance of the ’valley’ and coalescence of the ’hills’ due to the limits t a ↓ t c and t b ↑ t c be any function with t ∈ hill 2 and s < t . In the valley is B ( t , s ) deﬁned by B ( t , s ) = A ( t , s ) + t a (cid:90) u = s A ( t , u ) ˙ ϕ ( u − s ) d u . ( G . 1 ) In hill 1 is C ( t , s ) constructed according to C ( t , s ) = B ( t , s ) + t b (cid:90) u = s B ( t , u ) ˙ φ ( u − s ) d u . ( G . 2 ) The function C can be linked directly to A by substituting ( G . 1 ) in ( G . 2 ) and the result is ( G . 3 ) C ( t , s ) = A ( t , s ) + t a (cid:90) x = s A ( t , x ) ˙ ϕ ( x − s ) d s + t b (cid:90) x = s ˙ φ ( x − s ) (cid:110) A ( t , x ) + t a (cid:90) y = x A ( t , y ) ˙ ϕ ( y − x ) d y (cid:111) d x . Take the limits t b ↑ t c and t a ↓ t c , which shows at ﬁrst ( G . 4 ) ¯ C ( t , s ) = A ( t , s ) + t c (cid:90) x = s A ( t , x ) (cid:110) ˙ ϕ ( x − s ) + ˙ φ ( x − s ) (cid:111) d s + t c (cid:90) x = s (cid:110) t c (cid:90) y = x A ( t , y ) ˙ ϕ ( y − x ) ˙ φ ( x − s ) d y (cid:111) d x . The diacritic ’ ¯ ’ was added above C to express that the limits were taken . After changing the order of integration in the double integral 90 G . CROSSING LOCAL EXTREMA OF THE CONTACT RADIUS the ﬁnal result is ( G . 5 ) ¯ C ( t , s ) = A ( t , s ) + t c (cid:90) x = s A ( t , x ) (cid:110) ˙ ϕ ( x − s ) + ˙ φ ( x − s ) + x − s (cid:90) y = 0 ˙ ϕ ( x − s − y ) ˙ φ ( y ) d y (cid:111) d x . As the expression between brackets vanishes because φ and ϕ are each others Riemann - Stieltjes inverse with initial value φ 0 = ϕ 0 = 1 ( see ( A . 4 ) ) it follows that ( G . 6 ) ¯ C ( t , s ) = A ( t , s ) , that is , ¯ C is the continuation of A to hill 1 after it coalesced with hill 2 . The situation where two ’valleys’ coalese is basically the same , except that the functions φ and ϕ must be interchanged in the three equations ( G . 1 ) to ( G . 2 ) and that in Fig . G . 2 a ’hill’ becomes a ’valley’ and vice versa . The functions A and C can represent T j or N j with even index whereas B can represent these function for an odd index . Speciﬁcally , if A represents T 2 k for k = 0 , 1 , 2 . . . , then B and C represent T 2 k + 1 and T 2 k + 2 , respectively . For the N j kernels the situation is somewhat dif - ferent as N 0 does not exist ; the N j sequence starts with N 1 . These kernels must be treated differently because the functions A , B and C can only represent N 2 k , N 2 k + 1 and N 2 k + 2 kernels , respectively , start - ing at the value k = 1 For the N 1 and N 2 kernels the current time t is not in ’hill 2’ as shown in Fig . G . 2 , but in the preceding ’valley’ t b ≤ t ≤ t a and without loss of generality the choice t = t c is made . The N j sequence starts with N 1 = ˙ ϕ ( t c − s ) . Now N 2 ( t c , s ) = ˙ ϕ ( t c − s ) + t b (cid:90) u = s ˙ ϕ ( t c − u ) ˙ φ ( u − s ) d u = ˙ ϕ ( t c − s ) + t b − s (cid:90) 0 ˙ ϕ ( t c − s − u ) ˙ φ ( u ) d u , ( G . 7 ) and the limit t a ↓ t c plus t b ↑ t c shows – again because φ and ϕ are each others Riemann - Stieltjes inverse with initial value φ 0 = ϕ 0 = 1 ( see ( A . 4 ) ) – that ¯ N 2 ( t c , s ) = ˙ ϕ ( t c − s ) + t c − s (cid:90) 0 ˙ ϕ ( t c − s − u ) ˙ φ ( u ) d s = − ˙ φ ( t c − s ) = − T 0 ( t c , s ) . ( G . 8 ) G . CROSSING LOCAL EXTREMA OF THE CONTACT RADIUS 91 Apart from its sign is ¯ N 2 equal to T 0 and this is as it should be , be - cause the integral operators in which the N j kernels are present al - ways occur in the formulae for the ’valley’ intervals with a minus sign , whereas in the corresponding formulae for the ’hill’ intervals the oper - ators with T j kernels have a plus sign , cf . ( 4 . 13 ) , ( 4 . 15 ) , ( 4 . 31 ) , ( 4 . 32 ) with ( 4 . 24 ) , ( 4 . 26 ) , ( 4 . 39 ) , ( 4 . 37 ) . Special attention must also be paid to the behaviour of ∂ N 2 ( t , s ) / ∂ t when the next adjacent ’valley’ disap - pears . In E . 3 it was shown that the derivatives of the kernels trans - form in the same way as the kernels itself and the starting kernel for the derivatives ∂ N j ( t , s ) / ∂ t is ¨ ϕ ( t − s ) , i . e . , the derivative of N 1 . Then , with t = t c in the ’valley’ , the derivative of N 2 is ( G . 9 ) ∂ N 2 ( t c , s ) ∂ t = ¨ ϕ ( t c − s ) + t a (cid:90) u = s ¨ ϕ ( t c − u ) ˙ φ ( u − s ) d u . The limits t b ↑ t c and t a ↓ t c indicate that lim t b ↑ t c , t a ↓ t c ∂ N 2 ( t c , s ) ∂ t = ¨ ϕ ( t c − s ) + t c − s (cid:90) u ¨ ϕ ( t c − s − u ) ˙ φ ( u ) d u = − ¨ φ ( t c − s ) + ˙ φ 0 ˙ φ ( t c − s ) . ( G . 10 ) The validity of the last equality sign is guarantied by ( A . 5 ) as φ and ϕ are each others Riemann - Stieltjes inverse with initial value φ 0 = ϕ 0 = 1 , and ˙ φ 0 = − ˙ ϕ 0 . APPENDIX H Extremal contact in the stationary phase H . 1 . Maxima of contact radius and depth coincide Fig . H . 1 depicts a typical part of a smooth and periodic c ( t ) - curve during the stationary phase and the period in this phase phase is Λ . Consider a value for R just below the maximum of c ( t ) at t n . Because of the periodicity , c ( t ) has the same maximum value at t n − j = t n − j Λ for j = 0 , 1 , . . . , .

Periodic contact radius during the stationary phase . Line r = R near maxima . equal . . Moreover , the summations cancel because , the functions U j and H j are integrals between τ 2 j + 1 ( R , n ) and τ 2 j ( R , n ) and the lower and upper integration boundaries become equal in the limit R ↑ c ( t n ) thus rendering all integrals zero and , therefore , ( H . 1 ) h ( t n ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t n ) ⇒ c ( t n ) = (cid:67) ( h ( t n ) ) . Next consider the time derivative that can be constructed from the two equations ( 6 . 7 ) and ( 6 . 8 ) . For ﬁxed R , but τ 0 and τ 1 near t n , and j = 1 , 2 , ··· the following expansions apply : h ( τ 0 ) − h ( τ 1 ) = ˙ h ( t n ) ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) + O ( ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) 2 ) , ( H . 2 ) U j ( τ 0 , R , n ) − U j ( τ 1 , R , n ) = ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) ˙ U j ( t n , R , n ) + O ( ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) 2 ) , ( H . 3 ) H j ( τ 0 , R , n ) − H j ( τ 1 , R , n ) = ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) ˙ H j ( t n , R , n ) + O ( ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) 2 ) , ( H . 4 ) 92 H . 2 .

( H . 6 ) The terms U 0 ( τ 0 , R , n ) and H 0 ( τ 0 , R , n ) in ( 6 . 7 ) are rewritten using the mean value theorem for integrals , i . e . , there exist ξ 1 ∈ ( τ 1 , τ 0 ) and ξ 2 ∈ ( τ 1 , τ 0 ) such that U 0 ( τ 0 , R , n ) = ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) T 0 ( τ 0 , ξ 1 , R , n ) = ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) ˙ φ ( τ 0 − ξ 1 ) ( H . 7 ) H 0 ( τ 0 , R , n ) = ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) T 0 ( τ 0 , ξ 2 , R , n ) h ( ξ 2 ) = ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) ˙ φ ( τ 0 − ξ 1 ) h ( ξ 2 ) ( H . 8 ) The difference of ( 6 . 7 ) and ( 6 . 8 ) , with ( H . 2 ) to ( H . 8 ) used in it and divided by τ 0 − τ 1 yields ( H . 9 ) (cid:76) (cid:48) ( R ) (cid:195) ˙ φ ( τ 0 − ξ 1 ) + ∞ (cid:88) j = 1 ˙ U j ( t n , R , n ) (cid:33) = ˙ h ( t n ) + ˙ φ ( τ 0 − ξ 1 ) h ( ξ 2 ) + ∞ (cid:88) j = 1 ˙ H j ( t n , R , n ) + O ( ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) ) . As R = c ( t n ) − O ( δ 2 ) and O ( ( τ 0 − τ 1 ) ) = O ( δ ) , the limit R ↑ c ( t n ) , i . e . , δ ↓ 0 , of this equation results in ( H . 10 ) { (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t n ) ) − h ( t n ) } ˙ φ 0 = ˙ h ( t n ) ⇒ ˙ h ( t n ) = 0 because τ 0 → t n , τ 1 → t n , ξ 1 → t n , ξ 2 → t n , (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t n ) ) → h ( t n ) and the summations in ( H . 9 ) cancel since the integration boundaries of these terms become equal . So , the ﬁnal conclusion is that during the station - ary phase the maxima of depth and contact radius occur at the same time and are related by h ( t n ) = (cid:76) (cid:48) ( c ( t n ) ) , i . e . , c ( t n ) = (cid:67) ( h ( t n ) ) . H . 2 . Minima of contact radius and load coincide The simpliﬁed equations ( 4 . 41 ) and ( 4 . 42 ) at the end , τ 1 ( R , n ) , and start , τ 2 ( R , n ) , of ’valley’ n are (cid:96) ( τ 1 ) + ∞ (cid:88) k = 0 Q k ( τ 1 , R , n ) = 4 (cid:71) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 − ∞ (cid:88) k = 1 V k ( τ 1 , R , n ) (cid:33) ( H . 11 ) and (cid:96) ( τ 2 ) + ∞ (cid:88) k = 1 Q k ( τ 2 , R , n ) = 4 (cid:71) ( R ) (cid:195) 1 − ∞ (cid:88) k = 1 V k ( τ 2 , R , n ) (cid:33) , ( H . 12 ) respectively . Consider ( H . 11 ) and ( H . 12 ) along a line r = R just above the minima of c ( t ) ( Fig . H . 2 ) . In the limit of R to the minimum values 94 H .

Heuristically one would expect that this means that all ’hills’ now must be counted as a single large ’hill’ and that the kernels of the integral operators V j become equal to N 2 . In Appendix G it is shown that this expectation is correct and also shown there is that in this limit N 2 → − T 0 = − ˙ φ . Since τ 1 ( R , n ) → t n and as in the stationary phase all minima of the contact radius are equal , it is found that lim R ↓ c ( t n ) V k ( τ 1 , R , n ) = − t n + 1 − k (cid:90) t n − k ˙ φ ( t n − s ) d s = φ ( ( k − 1 ) Λ ) − φ ( k Λ ) ( H . 13 ) resulting in lim R ↓ c ( t n ) (cid:195) 1 − ∞ (cid:88) k = 1 V k ( τ 1 , R , n ) (cid:33) = φ ( ∞ ) . ( H . 14 ) The previous results lead to the conclusion that in the stationary phase the minima of the contact radius are related to the current load values by ( H . 15 ) (cid:96) ( t n ) = 4 (cid:71) ( c ( t n ) ) φ ( ∞ ) . For the rate of change of the load at t n the difference of ( H . 11 ) and ( H . 12 ) is taken and the rest of the procedure is similar to that followed in H . 1 . Expansion of this difference in powers of τ 1 − τ 2 at constant R H . 2 . MINIMA OF CONTACT RADIUS AND LOAD COINCIDE 95 leads for k = 1 , 2 , . . . to (cid:96) ( τ 1 ) − (cid:96) ( τ 2 ) = ˙ (cid:96) ( t n ) ( τ 1 − τ 2 ) + O ( ( τ 1 − τ 2 ) 2 ) , ( H . 16 ) Q k ( τ 1 , R , n ) − Q k ( τ 2 , R , n ) = ( τ 1 − τ 2 ) ˙ Q k ( t n , R , n ) + O ( ( τ 1 − τ 2 ) 2 ) , ( H . 17 ) V k ( τ 1 , R , n ) − V k ( τ 2 , R , n ) = ( τ 1 − τ 2 ) ˙ V k ( t n , R , n ) + O ( ( τ 1 − τ 2 ) 2 ) . ( H . 18 ) For k = 0 the mean value theorem for integrals ensures that a scalar ζ ∈ ( τ 2 , τ 1 ) exists such that ( H . 19 ) Q 0 ( τ 1 , R , n ) = ( τ 1 − τ 2 ) (cid:96) ( ζ ) N 1 ( τ 1 , ζ , R , n ) = ( τ 1 − τ 2 ) (cid:96) ( ζ ) ˙ ϕ ( τ 1 − ζ ) . The derivatives of the integrals V k and Q k are given by ˙ V k ( t , R , n ) = τ 2 k (cid:90) τ 2 k + 1 ∂ N 2 k ( t , s , R , n ) ∂ t d s , ( H . 20 ) ˙ Q k ( t , R , n ) = τ 2 k + 1 (cid:90) τ 2 k + 2 ∂ N 2 k + 1 ( t , s , R , n ) ∂ t (cid:96) ( s ) d s . ( H . 21 ) The expanded difference of ( H . 11 ) and ( H . 12 ) divided by τ 1 − τ 2 and in the limit R ↓ c ( t n ) shows , ﬁrstly , that for k ≥ 1 all terms with ˙ Q k cancel because the integration limits become equal and , secondly , that the contribution of Q 0 reduces to (cid:96) ( t n ) ˙ ϕ 0 ( see ( H . 19 ) ) . Thirdly , the in - tegrands ∂ N 2 k / ∂ t of ˙ V k become all equal to ∂ N 2 / ∂ t evaluated at t n and the integration limits become t n − k and t n + 1 − k . According to ( G . 10 ) , ∂ N 2 ( t n , s , c ( t n ) , n ) / ∂ t equals − ¨ φ ( t n − s ) + ˙ φ 0 ˙ φ ( t n − s ) . Consequently ( H . 22 ) lim R ↓ c ( t n ) (cid:161) − ˙ V k ( t , R , n ) (cid:162) = t n + 1 − k (cid:90) t n − k { ¨ φ ( t n − s ) − ˙ φ 0 ˙ φ ( t n − s ) } d s = − ˙ φ ( ( k − 1 ) Λ ) + ˙ φ ( k Λ ) + ˙ φ ( 0 ) { φ ( ( k − 1 ) Λ ) − φ ( k Λ ) } . The sum over k of ( H . 22 ) with φ 0 = 1 and ˙ φ ( ∞ ) = 0 reveals that ( H . 23 ) ∞ (cid:88) k = 1 (cid:195) lim R ↓ c ( t n ) − ˙ V k ( t , R , n ) (cid:33) = − φ 0 φ ( ∞ ) .

This equation combined with ( H . 15 ) and ˙ ϕ 0 = − ˙ φ 0 proves that in the stationary phase ( H . 25 ) ˙ (cid:96) ( t n ) = 0 , i . e . , load and contact radius reach their minimum simultaneously .

EXAMPLE 1 : SLS MATERIAL & DEPTH CONTROL 97 which leads to ( I . 10 ) B ( X , Y ) = κ 1 + κ 2 (cid:110) exp ( κ Y ) { κ cos X + sin Y } − cos Y sin X + sin Y cos X − κ { cos Y cos X + sin Y sin X } (cid:111) . Inspection of ( I . 1 ) , ( I . 2 ) and ( I . 3 ) to ( I . 6 ) shows that all the sum - mations are geometric sequences with the exponential Z as common ratio . The argument of this exponential ranges between − 2 κπ and − 2 κπ ( 1 − q ) and is always negative ; the common ratio is smaller than one and ( I . 11 ) ∞ (cid:88) j = 0 Z j ( Y ) = 1 1 − Z ( Y ) , ∞ (cid:88) j = 1 Z j ( Y ) = Z ( Y ) 1 − Z ( Y ) . From all these results the next four relations follow 1 + ∞ (cid:88) 0 U j ( τ 0 ) = 1 − q exp ( − κ Y ) A ( Y ) 1 1 − Z ( Y ) , ( I . 12 ) 1 + ∞ (cid:88) 1 U j ( τ 1 ) = 1 − q A ( Y ) Z ( Y ) 1 − Z ( Y ) , ( I . 13 ) cos τ 0 + ∞ (cid:88) 0 F j ( τ 0 ) = cos X − q exp ( − κ Y ) B ( X , Y ) 1 1 − Z ( Y ) , ( I . 14 ) ( I . 15 ) cos τ 1 + ∞ (cid:88) 1 F j ( τ 1 ) = cos X cos Y + sin X sin Y − q B ( X , Y ) Z ( Y ) 1 − Z ( Y ) , The right - hand sides of ( I . 12 ) and ( I . 13 ) represent the coefﬁcients b 1 ( Y ) and b 2 ( Y ) appearing in the matrix equation ( 6 . 16 ) from Chap . 6 . 2 . Upon substitution of the expressions for A and Z from ( I . 8 ) it is found that b 1 ( Y ) = 1 − q 1 − exp ( − κ Y ) 1 − exp { − κ ( qY + 2 π ( 1 − q ) ) } ( I . 16 ) b 2 ( Y ) = 1 − q { exp ( + κ Y ) } exp { κ ( qY + 2 π ( 1 − q ) ) } 1 − exp { κ ( qY + 2 π ( 1 − q ) ) } ( I . 17 ) The other coefﬁcients follow from the observations that the left - hand sides of the basic equations ( I . 1 ) and ( I . 2 ) are linear forms in the vari - ables sin τ 0 = sin X and cos τ 0 = cos X . The coefﬁcients m ij in the ma - trix equation ( 6 . 16 ) can then be found by differentiating these forms – actually the right - hand sides of ( I . 14 ) and ( I . 15 ) – to sin X and cos X , 98 I .
