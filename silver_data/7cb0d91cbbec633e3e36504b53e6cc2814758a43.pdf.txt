Parthenolide ( PN ) is a main bioactive molecule in feverfew which belongs to sesquiterpene lactone compounds . Currently , the plant cell suspen - sion has been used as a useful method to produce secondary metabolites ( SMs ) components . Meanwhile , the elicitor application is an effective strategy to induce the production of SMs in plants . The present study was conducted as two different experiments in cell suspension of feverfew . In the first experiment , the effects of explant ( shoot and root ) , hormone ( TDZ + NAA and TDZ + 2 . 4 - D ) on cell dry weight for one month were investigated . In the second experiment , the effect of elicitor ( namely , MJ , YE and Ag + ) and the hormones after 24 , 48 and 72 h on PN content was assessed . The result of the first experiment revealed that the simple effects and the interaction of hormone × explant were significant ( P < 0 . 01 ) for cell dry weight . Growth rate analysis showed that shoot - derived cell suspension in 1 mg L − 1 NAA + 0 . 5 mg L − 1 TDZ treatment had the highest amount of cell dry weight 14 days after the culture . According to the second experiment , the highest PN content was obtained in cell suspension containing 0 . 5 mg L − 1 2 , 4 - D + 0 . 1 mg L − 1 TDZ with application of the YE + MJ elicitor after 48 h . The cell suspension treatment with each of the elicitors had a positive effect on the PN production . In conclusion , the application of combined elicitors in fever - few cell suspension culture can be used as an efficient tool for large - scale PN production .

Introduction Feverfew ( Tanacetum parthenium ) is one of the most important medicinal plants with different pharmacologi - cal and therapeutic properties ( Pourianezhad et al . 2016 ) . It is a perennial plant of Asteraceae family . The plant is native to Kazakhstan , Central Asia and Mediterranean region , but it can be found in different parts of Europe , Asia and America ( Arabasi and Bayram 2005 ; Farzaneh et al . 2002 ) . The plant has been used to treat a wide range of diseases such as menstrual disorders , toothache , migraine , asthma , fever , stomach ache , arthritis , insect bites and helminthiasis ( Maggi 2019 ; Sadat - Hosseini et al . 2017 ) . Secondary metabolites ( SMs ) have complex structures to be manufactured by chemical synthesis and thus frequently extracted from naturally grown or culti - vated plants ( Deepthi and Satheeshkumar 2016 ) . SMs are produced by different medicinal plants under biotic and abiotic stresses ( Ebrahimi et al . 2012 ; Farajpour et al . 2017 ) . Parthenolide ( PN ) is one of the major bioactive components of Feverfew . It is well known to have poten - tial anti - inflammatory properties ( Zhang et al . 2004 ) . PN , a sesquiterpene lactone , is mostly produced by the meva - lonate ( MVA ) pathway ( Fig . 1 ) . In this pathway , acetyl - CoA is converted to isopentenyl pyrophosphate ( IPP ) in six steps . Then , two IPPs and one dimethylallyl pyroph - osphate ( DMAPP ) are transformed to farnesyl diphos - phate ( FPP ) , which is precursor for all sesquiterpenes , through farnesyl diphosphate synthase ( FPS ) . Afterward , sesquiterpene synthase converted FPP to sesquiterpenes , which are further modified by oxidation reactions using cytochrome P450 enzymes . PN has a germacranolide Open Access * Correspondence : m - amir @ nigeb . ac . ir 3 Department of Plant Molecular Biotechnology , National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ( NIGEB ) , Tehran , Iran Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 7 Pourianezhad et al . Bioresour . Bioprocess . ( 2019 ) 6 : 23 backbone structure . Germacrene A oxidation to germac - ranoic acid in feverfew is usually accomplished by a simi - lar P450 monooxygenase ( Majdi et al . 2011 ; van Klink et al . 2003 ) . Transcription level of SMs - related genes determines the biosynthesis and accumulation of SMs in plants , which can occur in different growth phases and places such as organs , tissues ( De Kraker et al . 2002 ) . Dif - ferent parts of feverfew had different amounts of PN , so that the maximum PN content was detected in flower head and leaves ( 1 . 38 and 0 . 95 % , respectively ) , while the PN contents in stalks and roots were 0 . 08 and 0 . 01 % , respectively ( Heptinstall et al . 1992 ) . Currently , the plant cell culture has been used as a useful method for SMs components production ( Zhong 2001 ) . It is a promis - ing alternative approach instead of traditional methods ( Yue et al . 2016 ) . High SM production is important for the commercial utilization of cell suspension cultures . There are many reports about increasing the SM produc - tion in cell cultures via some culture parameters such as elicitation , hormone , medium culture and precursor feeding ( Khan et al . 2018 ) . The mechanism of induction of SMs production by elicitors is same as the biotic / abiotic stresses . Elici - tors activate a range of defense mechanisms , including the production and accumulation of an array of plant - defensive SMs in plants or cell suspension cultures ( Zhao et al . 2005 ) . There are several different components that can completely substitute for biotic or abiotic elicitors in the elicitation effect . Moreover , several binding sites for protein or peptides elicitors were also characterized in different plants ( Zhai et al . 2017 ) . Elicitors were used in many studies as an enhanced biomass production in different plants in vitro culture such as Ophiorrhiza mungos ( Deepthi and Satheeshkumar 2016 ) , Silybum marianum ( Gabr et al . 2016 ) , Glycyrrhiza uralensis ( Wang et al . 2017 ) , Eruca sativa ( Kastell et al . 2018 ) , Isa - tis tinctoria ( Gai et al . 2019 ) and Centella asiatica ( Gupta and Chaturvedi 2019 ) . There are many elicitors such as Fig . 1 Presumed biosynthetic pathway of parthenolide ; step 1 is catalyzed by germacrene A synthase ; steps 2 , 3 and 4 are catalyzed by germacrene A oxidase ; step 5a , 5b , costunolide synthase ; and step 6 , costunolide epoxidase / parthenolide synthase ( Majdi et al . 2011 ) Page 3 of 7 Pourianezhad et al . Bioresour . Bioprocess . ( 2019 ) 6 : 23 N , N ′ - dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and the derivatives of methyl jasmonate , salicylate and 2 , 6 - dichloroisonico - tinate as novel and powerful inducers for plant second - ary metabolism ( Huang et al . 2013 ; Qian et al . 2006a , b ) . However , among them , methyl jasmonate and salicylate elicitors were most used in different medicinal plants ( Gai et al . 2019 ; Hao et al . 2015 ; Krzyzanowska et al . 2012 ; Lee - Parsons et al . 2004 ; Majdi et al . 2015 ) . Elicitors such as MJ , SA , yeast extract ( YE ) and Ag + could be an effec - tive tool to increase PN production because they are not destructive for plant tissues related to terpene accumu - lation ( Majdi et al . 2011 ) . Leaves of T . parthenium were elicited using methyl jasmonate ( MJ ) and salicylic acid ( SA ) , and both elicitors activated PN biosynthesis ( Majdi et al . 2015 ) . We have previously investigated the effects of various elicitors including yeast extract ( YE ) ( 2 . 5 mg L − 1 ) , methyl jasmonate ( MJ ) ( 100 µM ) , Ag + ( 100 µM ) , YE + MJ , Ag + + MJ , YE + Ag + and YE + MJ + Ag + on the production of PN in feverfew hairy root culture ( Pourian - ezhad et al . 2019 ) . We obtained the highest values of PN contents by application of different combined elicitors . The aims of the current study were to ( 1 ) determine the appropriate time for applying the elicitors in suspension culture and ( 2 ) investigate the effect of elicitors and their combinations , namely MJ , YE , Ag + , MJ + YE , MJ + Ag + , YE + Ag + and MJ + YE + Ag + , on PN content in T . par - thenium suspension culture . Materials and methods Plant material and callus induction Seeds were obtained from Isfahan Pakan Bazr Company and surface - sterilized by soaking in 70 % ethanol for 30 s and immersing in 2 % sodium hypochlorite for 5 min . Afterward , the seeds were washed three times with ster - ile distilled water ( SDW ) and germinated on ¼ strength MS medium containing 3 and 0 . 8 % ( w / v ) sucrose and agar , respectively , at pH 5 . 7 ( Murashige and Skoog 1962 ) . The cultures were kept in an incubator at 25 °C with 16 : 8 - h long - day ( LD ) photoperiod and white fluorescent tubes ( ca . 40 µmol m − 2 s − 1 ) on ½ strength MS medium . In order to induce the callus formation , the sterilized explants ( leaf and stem ) were cut into 5 - mm sections and placed on ½ strength MS solid medium containing differ - ent concentrations of TDZ ( 0 , 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 mg L − 1 ) , NAA ( 0 , 0 . 5 , 1 and 2 mg L − 1 ) and 2 , 4 - D ( 0 , 0 . 5 , 1 and 2 mg L − 1 ) supplemented with 30 g L − 1 sucrose . After four weeks , the induced callus was detached from explants and sepa - rately cultured until being used in cell suspension culture . Cell suspension culture and growth curve analysis According to the results of callus induction experi - ments ( data not shown ) , the two best hormonal treat - ments including 1 mg L − 1 NAA and 0 . 5 mg L − 1 TDZ , and 0 . 5 mg L − 1 2 , 4 - D and 1 mg L − 1 TDZ were selected for cell suspension culture . To this aim , about 2 g of selected fresh callus was transferred to a 500 - mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 mL of culture medium and incubated at room temperature ( 25 °C ) on a rotary shaker ( 110 rpm ) in darkness . Subculture was performed at 2 - week interval by adding 30 mL of each suspension culture to an Erlen - meyer flask containing 70 mL of fresh culture medium . The growth of the cells in suspension cultures was studied by measurement of cell dry weight for 30 days . Five milliliters of suspension cultures was added to 100 - mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 20 mL of ½ strength MS liquid medium supplemented with the same hormo - nal concentrations , and the cultures were incubated on a rotary shaker at 90 rpm . At every two days , 1 . 5 mL of suspension cultures was filtered through Whatman fil - ter paper and dried at 60 °C for 24 h and cell dry weights were measured . Elicitors preparation and application In the present study , three elicitors and their combina - tions were used . The elicitors included yeast extract ( YE , 2 . 5 mg L − 1 ) , methyl jasmonate ( MJ , 0 . 5 mg L − 1 ) , AgNO 3 ( Ag + , 0 . 5 mg L − 1 ) , YE + MJ , Ag + + MJ , YE + Ag + and YE + MJ + Ag + . The elicitors were added to the suspen - sion cultures at day 14 . After 24 , 48 and 72 h of elicitor application , the cell biomass was frozen and lyophilized for PN content measurement . YE and AgNO3 were dis - solved in SDW and methyl jasmonate in 70 % ( v / v ) etha - nol . Membrane filter ( 0 . 2 µm ) was used to sterilize the solutions and then they were stored at − 20 °C . PN measurement Lyophilized cell biomass was powdered in liquid nitro - gen using a chilled mortar and pestle . The PN content was measured according to a protocol described by Jeong et al . ( Jeong et al . 2005 ) . All details about the used method can be found in our previous report ( Pourian - ezhad et al . 2019 ) . Statistical analysis In the present study , two different experiments were car - ried out . The first experiment was a completely rand - omized factorial design to study the effects of hormone , explant and time on cell dry weight . In the second one , the effects of hormone , elicitor and time on PN content were evaluated . The ANOVA and LSD tests were applied for statistical assessments using Statistical Analysis Sys - tem ( SAS , v9 . 1 for Windows , SAS Institute Cary , NC ) . Page 4 of 7 Pourianezhad et al . Bioresour . Bioprocess . ( 2019 ) 6 : 23 Results and discussion Effects of hormone and explant on cell dry weight According to our previous study , different hormonal treatments were used for callus induction in feverfew . Based on the results ( data not shown ) , two hormonal treatments including 1 mg L − 1 NAA + 0 . 5 mg L − 1 TDZ and 0 . 5 mg L − 1 2 , 4 - D + 0 . 1 mg L − 1 TDZ were selected for cell suspension culture . The hormonal treatments were applied to shoot - and root - derived cell suspen - sion cultures , and every two days , cell dry weight was measured for one month . ANOVA revealed that the simple effects and the interaction of hormone × explant were significant ( P < 0 . 01 ) for cell dry weight in feverfew cell suspension culture , while other interactions were nonsignificant ( Table 1 ) . Based on the mean compari - son results , the highest amount of cell dry weight was obtained from shoot - derived cell suspension in 1 mg L − 1 NAA + 0 . 5 mg L − 1 TDZ treatment , which was signifi - cantly different from the other treatments . No significant differences were observed among the other treatments ( Fig . 2 ) . Modarres et al . ( 2018 ) established a cell suspen - sion culture of Salvia leriifolia to induce the bio - produc - tion of phenolic acids . They obtained the highest rate of callus induction ( 100 % ) and callus dry weight ( 0 . 38 g ) in medium containing 5 mg L − 1 NAA and 6 - benzylami - nopurine . Studies have revealed that the plant growth and secondary metabolite production were affected by the auxin and cytokinin types and their concentrations ( Rao and Ravishankar 2002 ) . Time - course analysis of cell growth rate revealed a lag period of 10 days in shoot - derived cell suspension in TDZ + NAA treatment . A log - arithmic growth from days 4 – 14 was detected and then declined . The other treatments showed no logarithmic phase , and therefore , the best time for applying the elici - tors was selected based on this treatment . Furthermore , growth curve analysis showed that shoot - derived cell suspension in TDZ + NAA treatment had the highest amount of cell DW at day 14 ( Fig . 3 ) . Effects of elicitors on PN production The elicitors were applied to cell suspension 14 days after culture . After 24 , 48 and 72 h of elicitor applica - tion , their effects on PN content were investigated . ANOVA showed that the main effects and their inter - actions were significant ( P < 0 . 01 ) ( Table 1 ) . According to Wickens and Keppel ( 2004 ) , when the interaction of three factors was significant , less attention is paid to the main effects and we should focus on the inter - action effect . Therefore , in the present study , we have focused on the interaction of the three studied factors . The maximum PN production ( 0 . 066 mg g − 1 DW ) was observed in 0 . 5 mg L − 1 2 , 4 - D + 0 . 1 mg L − 1 TDZ treated by YE + MJ after 48 h , followed by the same treatment after 24 h ( 0 . 060 mg g − 1 DW ) . Meanwhile , the mini - mum PN production was observed in control treat - ment ( Fig . 4 ) . According to Fig . 4 , all applied elicitors significantly increased the PN production compared to the control treatment . In addition , the result showed that the highest PN content was achieved 48 h after elicitor application compared to the other times . PN is one of the most imperative sesquiterpene lactones of bioactive compounds in feverfew . The PN biosyn - thesis regulation process by elicitors is still unknown , while its production is highly genotype dependent ( Sto - jakowska and Kisiel 1997 ) . Methyl jasmonate and sali - cylic acid stimulate the biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites such as sesquiterpenes , phenols and indole alkaloids ( Matkowski 2008 ; Yu et al . 2006 ) .

( 2019 ) 6 : 23 and MJ elicitors influenced dry weight and secondary metabolites production in various plant species such as Ophiorrhiza mungos , Mentha piperita and Hypericum perforatum ( Deepthi and Satheeshkumar 2016 ; Krzyz - anowska et al . 2012 ; Wang et al . 2015 ) . According to the results , combined elicitors were more useful for PN production . In our previous study , the effects of YE , MJ , Ag elicitors and their combinations on PN production in feverfew hairy root culture were explored ( Pourian - ezhad et al . 2019 ) . The results of the study showed that the highest PN content was achieved after application of YE and MJ combined elicitors . In the present and our previous studies , the best treatment for PN pro - duction was YE and MJ combined elicitors ; however , the PN content in the cell suspension culture was more than hairy root culture .

( 2019 ) 6 : 23 positive effect of combined elicitors on PN production compared to the separate elicitor application is not yet clear . Whatever it is , the application of combined elici - tors can be more useful to the production of parthe - nolide than separately applied elicitors , which may be due to the interactions between different physiological processes ( Zhao et al . 2001 ) . Conclusion We successfully established a cell suspension culture in feverfew for the PN production . The highest amount of cell dry weight was obtained from shoot - derived cell suspension in 1 mg L − 1 NAA + 0 . 5 mg L − 1 TDZ treat - ment . Furthermore , the result showed that the highest PN content was obtained in cell suspension containing 0 . 5 mg L − 1 2 , 4 - D + 0 . 1 mg L − 1 TDZ with application of the YE + MJ elicitor after 48 h . The cell suspension treat - ment with each of the elicitors had a positive effect on the PN production . In conclusion , the application of com - bined elicitors in cell suspension culture of feverfew can be used as an efficient tool to increase the PN production .
