Pagano Department of Embryology , Carnegie Institution of Washington , Baltimore , Maryland 21210 - 3301 Abstract . We examined the metabolism and intracellu - lar transport of the D - erythro and L - threo stereoisomers of a fluorescent analogue of sphingomye - lin , N - ( N - 6 - ( 7 - nitrobenz - 2 - oxa - l , 3 - d iazol - 4 - y l ) amino caproyl ) - sphingosylphosphorylcholine ( C6 - NBD - SM ) , in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO - K1 ) fibroblast mono - layers . C6 - NBD - SM was integrated into the plasma membrane bilayer by transfer of C6 - NBD - SM monomers from liposomes to cells at 7°C . The cells were washed , and within 10 - 15 min of being warmed to 37°C , C6 - NBD - SM was internalized from the plasma membrane to a perinuclear location that colocalized with the centriole and was distinct from the lysosomes and the Golgi apparatus . This perinuclear region was also labeled by internalized rhodamine - conjugated transferrin . C6 - NBD - SM en - docytosis was not inhibited when the microtubules were disrupted with nocodazole ; rather , the fluorescent lipid was distributed in vesicles throughout the cell pc - riphery instead of being internalized to the perinuclear region of the cell . The metabolism of C6 - NBD - SM to other fluorescent sphingolipids at 37°C and its effect on C6 - NBD - SM transport was also examined . To study plasma membrane lipid recycling , C6 - NBD - SM was first inserted into the plasma membrane of CHO - K1 cells and then allowed to be internalized by the cells at 37°C . Any C6 - NBD - SM remaining at the plasma membrane was then removed by incubation with nonfluorescent liposomes at 7°C , leaving cells containing only internalized fluorescent lipid . The re - turn of C6 - NBD - SM to the plasma membrane from in - tracellular compartments upon further 37°C incubation was then observed . The half - time for a complete round C6 - NBD - SM recycling between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments was ~ 40 min . Pretreatment of cells with either monensin or nocodazole did not inhibit C6 - NBD - SM recycling . ECYC LING of plasma membrane receptors is a process involving membrane vesicle budding , fusion / fission and transport ( 10 , 38 ) . Since intracellular vesicles are involved in all known steps of the recycling process , there should also be considerable lipid transport in conjunction with protein recycling . However , no direct evidence for plasma membrane lipid recycling between intracellular com - partments and the cell surface is available . Previous work in our laboratory used fluorescent acyl chain - labeled glycerolipids as probes for studying endocyto - sis in cultured cells ( 32 , 37 ) . However , these probes are not practical for studies of lipid recycling because such studies require prolonged incubations at 37°C during which the fluorescent glycerolipids are extensively hydrolyzed by cel - lular phospholipases , releasing fluorescent fatty acid ( 37 ) . Since sphingomyelin ( SM ) ' is a major lipid constituent of the plasma membrane that is highly resistant to acyl chain hydrolysis ( 1 ) , we have used a fluorescent analog of SM , N - ( N - 6 - ( 7 - nitrobenz - 2 - oxa - l , 3 - diazol - 4 - y / ) aminocaproyl ) - sphingosylphosphorylcholine ( C6 - NBD - SM ) , to circumvent this problem in the present study . Using Chinese hamster ovary fibroblast cell line ( CHO - K1 ) cells , we examined the internalization of this fluorescent lipid from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments , and its subsequent return to the plasma membrane ( " recycling " ) with time . We also studied the effect of SM stereochemistry on its metab - olism and intracellular transport using stereoisomers of C6 - NBD - SM corresponding to the natural D - erythro or non - natural L - threo forms of SM . Finally , the patterns of intracel - lular labeling obtained with C6 - NBD - SM were compared to those of a recycling protein to learn whether the same com - partments are involved in lipid and protein recycling . This work is in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a doctoral degree by M . Koval in the Department of Biology , The Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , MD . 1 .

All organic solvents were purchased from Burdick & Jackson Laboratories Inc . ( Muskegon , MI ) . Rhodamine ( Rh ) - conjugated second antibodies were from Organon Teknika - Cappel ( West Chester , PA ) . Rh - conjugated Ricinus communis agglutinin 120 was purchased from Vector Laboratories , Inc . ( Burlingame , CA ) . Unless otherwise stated , all other materials were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . Cell Culture Monolayer cultures of CHO - K1 fibroblasts ( CCL 61 ; American Type Cul - ture Collection , Rockville , MD ) were grown in MEM Alpha medium ( No . 410 - 2000 ; Gibco Laboratories , Grand Island , NY ) supplemented with 5 % FBS in a water - saturated atmosphere of 5 % CO2 in air . Cells were grown for 48 - 72 h on No . 1 thickness , 25 - mm acid - washed glass coverslips to 20 % confluency for microscopy , or on 60 - mm plastic tissue culture dishes to 80 % confluency for biochemical analysis . Lipid Synthesis and Analysis C6 - NBD - SM was synthesized from C6 - NBD - fatty acid and sphingosyl - phosphorylcholine by oxidation - reduction condensation with triphenyl - phosphine and 2 - 2 ' - dipyridyldisulflde ( 19 , 24 ) . TLC of the reaction mixture on silica gel 60 plates ( E . Merck , Darmstadt , FRG ) developed in CHCI3 / CH3OH / 28 % NH4OH / H20 ( 72 : 48 : 2 : 9 , vol / vol / vol / vol ) resolved two products , C6 - NBD - SM1 ( Rf = 0 . 31 ) and C6 - NBD - SM2 ( Rf = 0 . 36 ) , both having the expected molecular mass of 740 . 9 D as determined by mass spec - trometry . Samples of each C6 - NBD - SM isomer were hydrolyzed to C6 - NBD - ceramide ( Cer ) using sphingomyelinase ( human placenta ) in vitro as previ - ously described ( 25 ) . Reverse - phase HPLC ( 33 ) of the resulting fluorescent Cers showed that hydrolysis of C6 - NBD - SM1 produced only D - erythro - C6 - NBD - Cer , while hydrolysis of C6 - NBD - SM2 produced only L - threo - C6 - NBD - Cer . Thus , we identified C6 - NBD - SM1 as D - erythro - C6 - NBD - SM and C6 - NBD - SM2 as L - threo - C6 - NBD - SM . N - Sul forhodamine ( SRh ) - conjugated dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine ( 43 ) and N - ( C6 - NBD ) - o - erythro - sphingosine ( C6 - NBD - Cer ; 33 ) were syn - thesized and purified as previously described . Concentrations of lipid stock solutions were determined by phosphorus measurement ( 35 ) or by reference to known concentrations of fluorescent standards . Lipid Vesicles Small unilamellar vesicles ( SUV ) were formed by ethanol injection ( 20 ) as follows . C6 - NBD - SM and DOPC ( typically 2 : 3 ; mol / mol ) were mixed in chloroform / methanol ( 2 : 1 ) , dried first under nitrogen , then in vacuo , and dissolved in ethanol ( 2 . 8 mM total lipid concentration ) . This ethanol solu - tion was injected into 17 . 5 vol of 10 mM Hepes - buffered calcium and magnesium - free Puck ' s saline ( HCMF ) while vortex - mixing . The vesicle preparation was dialyzed at 4°C overnight against Hepes - buffered MEM , pH 7 . 4 ( HMEM ) , and diluted to a final concentration of 25 ~ M total lipid in HMEM ( unless otherwise specified ) . DOPC vesicles for the back - exchange procedure ( see below ) were pre - pared as large unilamellar vesicles by extrusion ( LUVET ) as follows ( 14 ) . DOPC in chloroform was dried first under nitrogen , then in vacuo , and sus - pended into 2 ml HCMF to obtain a final DOPC concentration of 10 - 40 mM . This suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen , thawed at 37°C , frozen and thawed again , and then passed 10 times through two stacked 25 - mm polycarbonate filters ( 0 . 1 / xm pore size ; Nuclepore Corp . , Pleasanton , CA ) in an extruder device ( Lipex Biomembranes , Inc . , Vancouver , Canada ) at 250 lb / in 2 . The resulting LUVETs were diluted with HMEM to a final con - centration of 400 ~ M DOPC in HMEM . Incubation of Lipid Vesicles with Cells Monolayer cultures were cooled to 7°C for 5 min , washed twice with HMEM and then incubated with vesicles containing fluorescent lipid , typi - cally using 25 # M C6 - NBD - SM / DOPC ( 2 : 3 ; mol / mol ) SUV in HMEM at 7°C for 30 min ( standard conditions ) . Incubations were stopped by washing the cells three times with cold HMEM . In most experiments , the cultures were subsequently warmed to 37°C by adding prewarmed HMEM to the cells and incubating at 37°C in a water - saturated incubator . To remove C6 - NBD - SM associated with the plasma membrane , the cells were back - exchanged ( 37 , 40 ) by incubating at 7°C with back - exchange medium ( DOPC LUVETs in HMEM ; see above ) . The back - exchange medium was replaced every 5 min with fresh 7°C back - exchange medium for a total of six treatments . After back - exchange , cultures sometimes were further incubated at 37°C with either prewarmed HMEM alone or prewarmed HMEM containing back - exchange medium ( to remove any C6 - NBD - lipid transported to the plasma membrane during the second 37°C incubation ) . After each 15 - min period of reincubation at 37°C , the medium was replaced with the same type of prewarmed medium . Analysis of Fluorescent Lipid Metabolism Monolayer cultures of cells treated with fluorescent lipid were scraped into 1 ml HMEM with a policeman ( Teflon , Wilmington , DE ) . The culture dish was washed with an additional 1 ml HMEM that was combined with the cell suspension . The cell suspension was centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C , and the resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 200 ~ 1 HMEM . A 40 - / zl aliquot of this suspension was assayed for DNA content with either bis - benzimide H 33258 ( 21 ) or diphenylamine ( 23 ) using a salmon sperm DNA standard . Triton X - 100 was addedto the remaining 160 # 1 to a fnal concen - tration of 1 % ( wt / vol ) , and the NBD and SRh fluorescence was measured using a fluorimeter ( model 8000C ; SLM Instruments , Inc . , Urbana , IL ) . The amounts of C6 - NBD - SM or N - SRh - dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine in HMEM present were determined by reference to standard curves . To examine C6 - NBD - SM metabolism , the cell pellet was resuspended in 900 / zl HMEM . A 100 - # 1 aliquot of this suspension was assayed for DNA content , and the lipids were extracted from the remaining 800 p . l using the procedure of Bligh and Dyer ( 3 ) using 0 . 9 % NaCI and 10 mM HCI in the aqueous phase . Lipid extracts were chromatographed on silica gel 60 thin - layer plates using CHCI3 / CH3OH / 28 % NH4OH / H20 ( 72 : 48 : 2 : 9 , vol / vol / vol / vol ) as the developing solvent . TLC plates were analyzed quantitatively as follows . A Newvicon camera ( Dage - MTI Inc . , Michigan City , IN ) was used to obtain a video image of a TLC plate illuminated by UV light . The video image was then digitized using an IP - 512 image processing system ( Imaging Technology , Inc . , Woburn , MA ) . Regions of the digitized image corresponding to areas of the plate containing a single C6 - NBD - lipid spe - cies were identified by the operator as regions to be quantified . Blank areas adjacent to selected regions were used to determine the amount of back - ground signal resulting from the TLC plate . The amount of NBD fluores - cence was then calculated as the difference between the total intensity within each region and the background intensity . Absolute amounts of the C6 - NBD - lipid species were determined by reference to known amounts of fluorescent lipid chromatographed and analyzed under the same conditions . Calculation of Results The percentage of C6 - NBD - SM removed by the back - exchange process % ( C6 - NBD - SM ) rem was calculated using the equation % ( C6 - NBD - SM ) rem = 1 - ( ( C6 - NBD - SM ) Bx / ( C6 - NBD - SM ) tot ) × 100 , ( 1 ) where the amount of C6 - NBD - SM was determined as pmole fluorescent SM / # g DNA in both back - exchanged cells ( C6 - NBD - SM ) ax and non - back - exchanged cells ( C6 - NBD - SM ) tot . The amount of C6 - NBD - lipid re - moved by back - exchange reflects the amount of fluorescent lipid located at the plasma membrane ( 25 , 27 , 37 , 44 ) . The amount of newly synthesized C6 - NBD - SM in o - erythro - C6 - NBD - SM - labeled cells was calculated from the amount of cell - associaled C6 - NBD - glucosylceramide ( GIcCer ) by : ( newly synthesized C6 - NBD - SM ) = 1 . 41 • ( C6 - NBD - GIcCer ) , ( 2 ) where 1 . 41 was the ratio of C6 - NBD - SM to C6 - NBD - GIcCer synthesized by CHO - K1 cells following incubation with D - erythro - C6 - NBD - Cer ( see The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 108 , 1989 2170 Results ) . The amount of Ct - NBD - SM that was not metabolized was deter - mined by : ( nonmetabolized Ct - NBD - SM ) = ( total C6 - NBD - SM ) - ( newly synthesized Ct - NBD - SM ) . ( 3 ) Values in Eqs . 2 and 3 were determined as pmole Ct - NBD - SM / # g DNA . Microscopy and Rh - Transferrin Labeling Procedures A microscope ( model IM - 35 , Carl Zeiss , Inc . , Thornwood , NY ) equipped with epifluorescence optics was used . Filter combinations eliminated cross - over between NBD and rhodamine fluorescence channels . Rhodamine - conjugated transferrin ( Rh - Tf ) was kindly provided by Drs . T . McGraw and E Maxfield ( Columbia University ) . For colocalization studies , ceils were first labeled with Ct - NBD - SM for 30 min at 7°C , washed , and then incubated at 37°C for 30 min in HMEM containing 20 # g / ml Rh - Tf . The cells were then treated with back - exchange medium at 7°C and photographed sequentially using optics appropriate for NBD and rhodamine fluorescence . Lysosome Labeling Lysosomes were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti - body to a 95 - kD lysosomal glycoprotein ( anti - lgp95 ) , kindly provided by Drs . S . Schmid and I . Mellman ( Yale University ) . Cells were first labeled with C6 - NBD - SM for 30 rain at 70C and then warmed for 30 rain at 37°C , followed by treatment with back - exchange medium at 7°C . All remaining steps were performed at room temperature . The cells were fixed ( 22 ) using 3 % paraformaldehyde - 0 . 02 % glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 rain , washed , and then photographed using optics appropriate for NBD fluorescence . The samples were then treated with 0 . 2 M glycine in H20 for 5 rain , followed by a 10 - s treatment with 100 % methanol at - 20°C to render the cells per - meable to antibodies . The cells were then washed with PBS containing 0 . 2 % gelatin , and incubated with anti - lgp95 at a 1 : 100 dilution in PBS - gelatin for 30 min . The cells were washed , incubated with rhodamine - conjugated rab - bit anti - mouse IgG at a 1 : 100 dilution in PBS - gelatin for 30 rain , and then washed with PBS . Cells previously photographed were relocated and pho - tographed using optics appropriate for rhodamine fluorescence . Alternatively , cells were labeled with C6 - NBD - SM for 30 min at 70C and then warmed to 37°C for 1 h in HMEM containing 2 mg / ml SRh - dextran ( 10 kD ) , followed by a 1 - h incubation at 37°C in HMEM alone ( 6 , 39 ) . The cells were treated with back - exchange medium at 7°C and then photographed using optics appropriate for beth NBD and rhodamine fluorescence . gelatin for 30 min to label the Golgi apparatus ( 46 ) . The cells were washed with PBS - gelatin and cells previously photographed were relocated and photographed using optics appropriate for Rh fluorescence . Miscellaneous Procedures Nocodazole . Ceils were preincubated with nocodazole ( 10 # g / ml ) for 90 min at 37°C by adding a 1000× nocodazole stock solution ( in DMSO ) to the culture medium . All incubation solutions contained 10 # g / ml noco - dazole . Monensin . Cells were preincubated with monesin ( 10 # M ) for 90 min at 37°C by adding a 1000× stock solution ( in ethanol ) into the culture medium . All incubation solutions contained 10 # M monensin . Energy depletion was performed by incubating cells at 7°C with SUV containing fluorescent lipid in the presence of 5 mM sodium azide and 50 mM 2 - deoxyglucose for 30 rain , followed by 37°C incubation in HMEM containing 5 mM sodium azide and 50 mM 2 - deoxyglucose for 30 min ( 37 ) . Results C ~ - NBD - SM Labeling and Internalization The amount of spontaneous transfer of Ct - NBD - SM from SUV to CHO - K1 monolayers at 7°C was determined as a function of time , SUV concentration , or mole fraction of Ct - NBD - SM in the SUV ( Fig . 1 ) . The amount of each Ct - NBD - SM isomer incorporated into CHO - K1 cells incubated with 25 # M C6 - NBD - SM / DOPC ( 2 : 3 ; mol / mol ) SUV in HMEM for 30 min at 7°C ( standard conditions ) is given in Table I . In some experiments , the SUV used for labeling also contained 2 mole % N - SRh - DOPE , a nonexchangeable fluo - rescent lipid marker ( 37 , 40 , 41 ) that provided a measure of SUV nonspecificaUy adsorbed to the cells . From these ex - periments , we calculate that > 96 % of the cell - associated C6 - NBD - SM fluorescence was the result of transfer of fluo - rescent SM to the plasma membrane of cells treated under standard incubation conditions . Cells labeled with SUV containing C6 - NBD - SM at 7°C Centriole Labeling Centrioles were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using autoanti - body 5051 ( 4 ) , kindly provided by Drs . T .

As long as labeled cells were kept at 7°C , at least 95 . 5 % of the cell - associated fluorescent lipid could be removed by back - exchange . When cells labeled at 7°C were warmed to 37°C , internalization of the fluorescent lipid was observed ( Fig . 2 , b - d ) . With increasing time at 37°C , there was an ac - cumulation of fluorescent lipid in intracellular vesicles , and , by 10 min , most of these vesicles had been transported to a central , perinuclear region of the cell . For 37°C incubations of 30 min or less , internalized D - erythro and L - threo - C6 - NBD - SM showed the same labeling pattern ( compare Fig . 2 d to Fig . 3 a ) . Incubation of cells in the presence of 5 mM sodium azide and 50 mM 2 - deoxyglucose inhibited endo - cytosis of C6 - NBD - SM from the plasma membrane ( not shown ) , supporting the notion that C6 - NBD - SM internal - ization is energy - dependent . When high concentrations of C6 - NBD - SM are incorpo - rated into membranes , self - quenching of the probe can occur ( 27 , 29 , 37 ) . To determine if self - quenching of C6 - NBD - SM was occurring , cells were labeled with C6 - NBD - SM at 7°C , washed , incubated at 37°C for varying amounts of time , washed , and then the amount of fluorescence in the presence or absence of 2 % Triton X - 100 was determined . The ratio of fluorescence in the presence or absence of Triton X - 100 for C6 - NBD - SM - labeled cells that were incubated at 37°C for 0 , 30 , and 60 min was 1 . 57 + 0 . 07 , 1 . 57 + 0 . 08 , and 1 . 58 + 0 . 01 , respectively ( n = 3 in each case ) , suggesting that nei - ther the plasma membrane nor intracellular compartments contained C6 - NBD - SM at self - quenching concentrations . Also , preliminary results using low light - level digital imag - ing microscopy have shown that CHO - K1 cells labeled with 100 - fold less C6 - NBD - SM ( equivalent to 0 . 02 % of the total Figure 2 .

The cells were then treated with back - exchange medium at 7°C to remove any C6 - NBD - SM remaining at the plasma membrane , washed , fixed and photographed for C6 - NBD - lipid fluorescence ( a ) . The cells were subsequently rendered permeable , treated with an antilysosomal antibody ( anti - lgp95 ) , and then labeled with Rh - conjugated rabbit anti - mouse IgG .

Characterization of Compartments Labeled by Endocytosed C ~ - NBD - SM To determine whether internalized C6 - NBD - SM was trans - ported to the lysosomes , cells were first labeled with fluores - cent SM under standard conditions and incubated for 30 min at 370C , followed by back - exchange . The cells were then sub - sequently labeled with anti - lgp95 , which recognizes a 95 - kD lysosomal glycoprotein ( Fig . 3 , a and b ) . Note the lack of lysosomes in the central region of the cell , in contrast to the intracellular vesicles labeled by internalized C6 - NBD - lipid . Also , it appeared that very little fluorescent lipid accumu - lated in the lysosomes under these conditions as indicated by a lack of probe colocalization . In a complementary experi - ment ( Fig . 3 , c and d ) , cells were labeled with C6 - NBD - SM under standard conditions and then incubated at 37°C for 1 h in the presence of the fluid phase marker SRh - dextran , followed by a 1 - h chase at 37°C in HMEM alone to insure that the SRh - dextran was transported to the lysosomes ( 39 ) . Even after a 2 - h incubation at 37°C , little , if any , C6 - NBD - lipid appeared to have accumulated in the lysosomes . Cells containing internalized C6 - NBD - SM were also sub - sequently labeled with an antibody that labels pericentriolar material ( 4 ) . Endocytic vesicles containing fluorescent lipid aggregated around the centriole in C6 - NBD - SM - labeled CHO - K1 cells ( Fig . 4 , a and b ) .

In the presence of 10 / zg / ml nocodazole , C6 - NBD - SM continued to be endocytosed , how - ever , microtubule disruption resulted in little internalized fluorescent lipid accumulation in the central region of the cells . Instead , C6 - NBD - lipid was distributed in vesicles throughout the periphery of the cell ( Fig . 4c ) . Quantitation of Metabolism and Endocytosis of C ~ - NBD - SM Cells labeled with either o - erythro or L - threo - C6 - NBD - SM at 7°C under standard conditions and then incubated at 37°C metabolized C6 - NBD - SM to other fluorescent sphingolipids ( Fig . 5 , a and b ) . Both C6 - NBD - SM isomers showed partial hydrolysis to the corresponding C6 - NBD - Cer isomer , but only o - erythro - C6 - NBD - SM - labeled cells produced C6 - NBD - GIcCer ( from C6 - NBD - Cer ) during the 37°C incuba - tion , probably because of the stereospecificity of the conver - sion of C6 - NBD - Cer to C6 - NBD - GIcCer ( 33 ) . No other fluorescent lipid species , including C6 - NBD - fatty acid , were produced during 37°C incubations of up to 6 h in cells la - beled with either fluorescent SM isomer . In addition , a small amount ( 1 . 7 _ 0 . 7 % ; n = 3 ) of o - erythro - C6 - NBD - SM was hydrolyzed to C6 - NBD - Cer during the 30 min incubation at 7°C .

The cells were then rendered permeable , and treated with Rh - conjugated Ricinus communis agglutinin 120 , which preferentially labels the Golgi apparatus ( 34 , 46 ) . The cells were washed , and the field , previously photographed for C6 - NBD - lipid fluorescence , was rephotographed for Rh fluorescence ( b ) . Note labeling around the perimeter of the nucleus ( arrowheads ) . ( c and d ) Cells were labeled with SUV containing D - erythro - C6 - NBD - SM at 7°C , washed , incubated for 30 min ( c ) or 2 h ( d ) at 37°C in HMEM , followed by treatment with back - exchange medium at 7°C and then photographed . Note the appearance of fluorescence around the perimeter of the nucleus with increasing time at 37°C ( arrowheads ) in addition to labeling of the central perinuclear region . Bar , 10 t ~ m . GlcCer during 37°C incubation was examined under a wide range of conditions . Cells were labeled at 7°C for 30 min with C6 - NBD - Cer / DOPC ( 2 : 3 , mol / mol ) SUV ( a ) at con - centrations ranging from 3 to 50 / ~ M total lipid , washed , and then incubated for 30 min at 37°C , or ( b ) at 25 / ~ M total lipid , washed , and then incubated at 37°C for times ranging from 5 min to 2 h . In all cases both C6 - NBD - SM and C6 - NBD - GlcCer were synthesized from fluorescent Cer . The ratio ( C6 - NBD - SM produced / C6 - NBD - GlcCer produced ) was 1 . 41 + 0 . 33 ( n = 26 ) . o - erythro - C6 - NBD - Cer metabolism was not affected when cells were treated with either 10 / ~ g / ml nocodazole or 10 / ~ M monensin . The intracellular distribution of exogenously supplied D - erythro - C6 - NBD - Cer was examined in CHO - K1 cells . Cells labeled with SUV containing fluorescent Cer at 7°C fox 30 min followed by 37°C incubation for 30 min showed prominent labeling largely around the perimeter of the nu - cleus ( Fig . 6 a ) . To confirm that C6 - NBD - Cer labeled the Golgi apparatus in CHO cells , as previously shown in other cell types ( 26 ) , the intracellular distributions of C6 - NBD - Cer and a lectin that preferentially labels the Golgi apparatus ( Rh - Ricinus communis agglutinin 120 ; 34 , 46 ) were com - pared . As seen in Fig . 6 ( a and b ) " Rh - RCA and C6 - NBD - Cer fluorescence extensively colocallzed , although subtle differences , possibly because of a slight change in the plane of focus , were observed . In contrast , ceils labeled with C6 - NBD - SM under standard conditions and then incubated at 37°C for 30 min largely contained intracellular fluorescent lipid in a central , perinuclear region of the cell with little labeling around the perimeter of the nucleus ( Fig . 6 c ) . How - ever , with increasing incubation time at 37°C , C6 - NBD - SM - labeled cells showed increasing amounts of labeling around the perimeter of the nucleus in addition to labeling of the central perinuclear region ( Fig . 6 d ) . These data sug - gest that , during 37°C incubations of fluorescent SM - labeled cells , C6 - NBD - Cer produced by the hydrolysis of C6 - NBD - SM was transported to the Golgi apparatus .

CHO - Ki cells were labeled with SUV containing o - eryth - ro - Ct - NBD - SM in HMEM for 30 rain at 7°C , washed , incubated at 37 " C in HMEM for the indicated amount of time , and then either harvested immediately or , in parallel experiments , after treatment with back - exchange medium at 7 " C to remove any Ct - NBD - lipid at the plasma membrane . The cell - associated lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC as described in the text . The amount of back - exchangeable C ~ - NBD - lipid was calculated using Eq . 1 ( see Mate - rials and Methods ) and all values are expressed as percentage of total cell - associated C6 - NBD - lipid . The amounts of newly synthe - sized C6 - N - BD - SM and nonmetabolized C6 - N - BD - SM were calcu - lated by Eq . 2 and 3 , respectively ( see Materials and Methods ) .

Data points are the mean of triplicate measurements . NBD - SM resulted from the hydrolysis of fluorescent SM to Ct - NBD - Cer followed by resynthesis of Ct - NBD - SM , cells were prelabeled with 32Porthophosphate followed by incu - bation with SUV containing either o - erythro or L - threo - C6 - NBD - SM at 7°C . The cells were then washed , incubated at 37°C for 2 h , and the cell - associated lipids were extracted and analyzed by two - dimensional TLC . In both cases , C6 - NBD - SM isolated from these cells had incorporated 32p ( not shown ) , suggesting that two pools of fluorescent SM were present ; i . e . , nonmetabolized and newly synthesized Ct - NBD - SM . The best resolution of C6 - NBD - SM from other radiolabeled lipids possible by TLC was adequate for autoradiography , but not for quantitative determination of 32p incorporation . Because CHO - K1 cells directly labeled with D - erythro - Ct - NBD - Cer produced Ct - NBD - SM and C6 - NBD - GlcCer at a constant ratio ( 1 . 41 : 1 ) , we used the amount of cell - associated fluorescent GlcGer to estimate the amount of newly synthe - sized Ct - NBD - SM formed by D - erythro - Ct - NBD - SM - la - beled cells during a given experiment ( Eq . 2 ) . The amount of nonmetabolized Ct - NBD - SM was then calculated as the difference between the total cell - associated C6 - NBD - SM and the amount of newly synthesized C6 - NBD - SM ( Eq . 3 ) . L - threo - Ct - NBD - SM - labeled ceils did not produce any C6 - NBD - GIcCer ; therefore , all quantitation of Ct - NBD - SM transport was done using o - erythro - Ct - NBD - SM - labeled cells . Fig . 7 shows the quantitative redistribution of fluorescent SM in a - erythro - C6 - NBD - SM - labeled CHO - K1 cells dur - ing a 37°C incubation . Ct - NBD - SM levels at the plasma membrane declined as the result of fluorescent SM endocyto - sis and hydrolysis to C ~ - NBD - Cer . The amount of endocy - tosed , nonmetabolized Ct - NBD - SM reached a plateau value of ~ 27 % of the total cell - associated C6 - NBD - lipid after 30 min at 37°C . The amount of newly synthesized Ct - NBD - SM produced during the 2 - h incubation period in - creased steadily to , x , 15 % of the total Ct - NBD - lipid , but re - mained less than the amount of internalized , nonmetabolized Ct - NBD - SM . Also , only small amounts of newly synthe - sized fluorescent SM were transported to the plasma mem - brane during this period ( ' ~ 3 % of the total Ct - NBD - lipid ) . Neither 10 # M monensin nor 10 # g / ml nocodazole inhibited either the Ct - NBD - SM internalization or Ct - NBD - GIcCer synthesis in Ct - NBD - SM - Iabeled cells ( Table II ) . Plasma Membrane Recycling of Ct - NBD - SM Cells were labeled with Ct - NBD - SM under standard condi - tions , washed , incubated at 37°C for 30 min and then treated with back - exchange medium at 7°C to remove any fluores - cent SM remaining at the plasma membrane , resulting in cells containing only internalized fluorescent lipid ( Fig . 8 a ) . Cells containing only internalized fluorescent lipid were fur - ther incubated at 37°C in HMEM and the transport of Ct - NBD - lipid from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane was observed ( Fig . 8 b ) . When cells that had been further incubated at 37°C were subsequently treated with back - exchange medium at 7°C , to remove any fluorescent lipid that had returned to the plasma membrane , C6 - NBD - lipid labeling in the periphery of the cell was revealed ( Fig . 8 c ) .

( a ) Cells were labeled with SUV containing o - erythro - C6 - NBD - SM in HMEM for 30 min at 7°C , washed , incubated at 37°C for 30 min in HMEM , and treated with back - exchange medium at 7°C resulting in cells containing only internalized C6 - NBD - lipid .

In some cases , perinuclear labeling was not visible for each cell in the field because of the plane of focus selected . Bar , 10 # m . uously removed to acceptor vesicles ( Fig . 8 d ) . Cells treated in this manner showed very little labeling of intracellular vesicles in the periphery of the cell , suggesting that labeling of the cell periphery shown in Fig . 8 c was because of the further internalization of C6 - NBD - lipid that had been re - turned to the plasma membrane . Quantitative analysis of cells containing only internalized D - erythro - C6 - NBD - SM that were further incubated for 30 min determined that 3 . 03 + 0 . 22 ( n = 3 ) pmole of non - metabolized C6 - NBD - SM / # g DNA was recycled back to the plasma membrane , while the combined amount of newly synthesized C6 - NBD - SM and C6 - NBD - GIcCer resulted in only 0 . 46 + 0 . 31 ( n = 3 ) pmole / # g DNA . Thus , > 86 % of the plasma membrane fluorescence observed in Fig . 8 b was the result of the recycling of nonmetabolized C6 - NBD - SM . The time course of nonmetabolized D - erythro - C6 - NBD - SM return to the plasma membrane from intracellular com - partments was also determined ( Fig . 9 ) . C6 - NBD - SM was transported to the plasma membrane from intracellular com - partments with a half - time of ~ 15 - 20 min . Combined with a half - time of ~ 15 - 20 min for C6 - NBD - SM internalization ( Fig . 7 ) , this gives a half - time for one complete round of re - cycling of " ~ , 30 - 40 min . The effects of 10 # g / ml monensin on C6 - NBD - SM recy - cling were also examined ( Table III ) . Similar amounts of transport of nonmetabolized , intracellular C6 - NBD - SM to the plasma membrane occurred in monensin - treated and control cells . However , transport of newly synthesized C6 - NBD - SM to the plasma membrane was abolished , consistent with previous results ( 25 ) . In spite of the altered pattern of C6 - NBD - SM internal - ization ( Fig . 4 c ) , nocodazole - treated cells exhibited plasma membrane recycling of nonmetabolized C6 - NBD - SM ( Table III ) . Neither the return of nonmetabolized C6 - NBD - SM to the plasma membrane nor the transport of newly synthesized C6 - NBD - SM were inhibited by nocodazole . In fact , noco - dazole appeared to increase the amount of newly synthesized C6 - NBD - SM transport to the plasma membrane . Since C6 - NBD - SM was capable of recycling , we wanted to compare the distribution of internalized C6 - NBD - SM Koval and Pagano Plasma Membrane Lipid Recycling 2177 d 6o ~ o 2 0 20 40 60 Minutes at 37 °C Figure 9 .

Cells were la - beled with C6 - NBD - SM at 7°C under standard conditions , washed , and then incubated for 30 min at 37°C in HMEM containing Rh - Tf . As shown in Fig . 10 , both C6 - NBD - SM and Rh - Tf were internalized to the central region of the cell ; however , some intracellular vesicles in the periphery of the cell appeared to be labeled only by C6 - NBD - SM . This could be , in part , because of a difference in the sensitivity of C6 - NBD - lipid detection versus Rh - Tf detection . Discussion In this study , we have examined the transport of the o - erythro and L - threo stereoisomers of a fluorescent analogue of sphin - gomyelin , C6 - NBD - SM , as probes for plasma membrane lipid transport in CHO - KI cells . Most of the intracellular C6 - NBD - SM was transported along the recycling pathway illustrated in Fig . 11 , pathway I . Both isomers of C ~ - NBD - SM labeled only the plasma membrane when incubated with cells at 7°C . Cells labeled with C6 - NBD - SM at 7°C and then incubated at 37°C endocytosed fluorescent SM to a perinuclear region of the cell that colocalized with the centri - ole . When cells containing only internalized C6 - NBD - lipid were further incubated at 37°C , C6 - NBD - SM was returned to the plasma membrane . Thus , C6 - NBD - SM recycles be - tween the plasma membrane and intracellular compart - ments . Both D - erythro and L - threo - C6 - NBD - SM were capa - ble of being recycled . In addition to the endocytosis of C6 - NBD - SM , some hy - drolyis of both C6 - NBD - SM isomers to the corresponding C6 - NBD - Cer isomer was observed upon 37°C incubation . C6 - NBD - Cer can spontaneously undergo transbilayer move - ment ( 31 ) , in contrast to C6 - NBD - SM which has a highly polar head group restricting it to one leaflet of a bilayer ( 17 ) . Thus , as illustrated in Fig . 11 , pathway H , C ~ - NBD - Cer produced by the hydrolysis of C6 - NBD - SM was transported to the Golgi apparatus , presumably by spontaneous diffusion ( 30 , 33 ) , where it was converted back to fluorescent SM and , in the case of D - erythro - C6 - NBD - SM , to fluorescent GlcCer . Consistent with the synthesis of C6 - NBD - SM at the Golgi apparatus ( 30 ) and the transport of newly synthesized C6 - NBD - SM through the Golgi apparatus ( 25 ) , the transport of newly synthesized C6 - NBD - SM to the plasma membrane was inhibited by monensin , while the recycling of nonmetab - olized C6 - NBD - SM was not affected by monesin treatment ( Table III ) . Fig . 11 depicts the partial hydrolysis of C6 - NBD - SM oc - curring at the plasma membrane . This is consistent with our observation that some hydrolysis of D - erythro - C6 - NBD - SM occurred at 7°C , in the absence of endocytosis . Neutral sphingomyelinases have been found in plasma membrane - enriched fractions from rat liver ( 16 ) , neuroblastoma cell cultures ( 5 ) , and human renal proximal tubule cell cultures ( 9 ) . It is possible that C6 - NBD - SM was also hydrolyzed by lysosomal ( acid ) sphingomyelinase ( 1 , 7 , 18 ) ; however , C6 - NBD - SM did not accumulate in the lysosomes , probably because of the sorting of endocytosed C6 - NBD - SM from the degradation pathway to a recycling pathway . Also , in - creasing lysosomal pH with NH4CI , which should reduce lysosomal sphingomyelinase activity , did not inhibit C6 - NBD - SM hydrolysis ( data not shown ) .

Pathway 1 , nonmetabolized Cr - NBD - SM inserted into the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane ( PM ) is endocytosed to intracellular vesicles in the region of the centriole . The internalized Cr - NBD - SM is subsequently transported from intracellular compartments back to the plasma membrane , resulting in a plasma membrane lipid recycling pathway . Pathway H , a small amount of Cr - NBD - SM is hydrolyzed to Cr - NBD - Cer at the plasma membrane . The fluorescent Cer produced spontaneously moves to the Golgi appara - tus where it is metabolized to newly synthesized Cr - NBD - SM and , in the case of D - erythro - Cr - NBD - Cer , to C6 - NBD - GIcCer . The metabolites are then transported from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane by a process that is inhibited by monensin treatment . deficient in lysosomal sphingomyelinase , may help deter - mine the relative importance of these two sites of SM hydro - lysis in the cell . Cr - NBD - SM - Iabeled CHO - K1 cells internalized fluores - cent SM that accumulated in intracellular vesicles associated with the centriole . These " perinuclear " endosomes have been observed in a variety of systems ( for review , see 15 ) and are distinct from peripheral endosomal compartments . The Golgi apparatus is often associated with the centriole , partic - ularly when migrating fibroblasts are examined ( 36 ) . Previ - ous work from our laboratory indicates that a fluorescent analogue of phosphatidylcholine is internalized from the plasma membrane and transported to the region of the Golgi apparatus in Chinese hamster V79 fibroblasts ( 37 ) . In CHO - K1 cells , we found that the Golgi apparatus and perinuclear endosomes were not usually juxtaposed , suggesting that the extent of colocalization of these compartments depends on the cell type . The association of intracellular compartments with micro - tubules has been examined elsewhere ( 8 , 13 , 28 , 42 ) . Disrup - tion of the microtubules did not inhibit the endocytosis or re - cycling of Cr - NBD - SM ; however , intracellular vesicles con - raining fluorescent SM no longer accumulated in the central region of the cell . Consistent with these results , transferrin also recycles in microtubule - disrupted cells ( 12 ) . Consistent with these studies , recycling of Cr - NBD - SM was not in - hibited by disruption of microtubules with nocodazole . One round of C6 - NBD - SM recycling occurs with a half - time of , , o40 min in CHO - K1 cells . In contrast , the half - time for transferrin recycling in CHO cells is ' ~ 15 min ( 47 ) . The slower rate of Cr - NBD - SM recycling is not surprising , since rapidly recycling receptors are actively clustered into coated pits ( 10 ) , while lipids are likely to undergo rapid random lateral diffusion throughout the plasma membrane bilayer . Max field and co - workers have shown that fluorescently la - beled transferrin segregates into a perinuclear compartment upon endocytosis in CHO - WTT2 cells that they identify as a postsegregation compartment along the exocytic portion of the plasma membrane recycling pathway ( 47 ) . We have found that Rh - Tf and Cr - NBD - SM are endocytosed to the same compartment by CHO - K1 cells during 37°C incubation . Whether all plasma membrane proteins and lipids recycle through this compartment is unknown at present . The use of Cr - NBD - SM in conjunction with fluorescently labeled pro - teins will enable the simultaneous visualization and mea - surement of lipid and protein transport in future studies . This approach could determine the extent to which plasma mem - brane recycling pathways taken by proteins and lipids coincide . We are grateful to Drs . M . Kirschner , I . Mellman , T .
