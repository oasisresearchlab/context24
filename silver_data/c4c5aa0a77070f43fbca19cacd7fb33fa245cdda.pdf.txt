The air we breathe contains microorganisms that can cause infectious respiratory diseases . After two occupants of an apartment were diagnosed with influenza in February of 2013 , efforts were made to detect and isolate airborne influenza virus using two different types of active air samplers : a Sioutas Personal Cascade Impactor Sampler ( PCIS ) and an SKC BioSampler . The PCIS collects size - fractionated particles by impaction on polytetrafluoroethylene filters , whereas the SKC BioSampler collects airborne particles in liquid media . Influenza H3N2 virus was collected by both types of air samplers . The PCIS collected a range of particle sizes containing influenza virus near one of the sick individuals but only ultrafine particles when the samplers were positioned farther away . Viable virus was present in the liquid collection media of the SKC BioSampler and some PCIS filters . These findings suggest that influenza patients produce ultrafine aerosol particles that contain viable virus . 1 . Introduction Airborne microorganisms are typically present in the air we breathe and are potential causes of infectious diseases . Influenza viruses are among the respiratory pathogens that can be transmitted by airborne routes [ 1 ‚Äì 4 ] . Breath - ing , coughing , sneezing , and talking during the course of influenza generate a cloud of airborne particles containing influenza virus . The airborne particles have diameters that range from a few millimeters ( large droplets formed dur - ing coughing and sneezing ) to submicron ( < 1 ùúá m ) ( formed during breathing ) . Small particles ( ‚â§ 5 ùúá m ) including droplet nuclei from evaporated larger particles can remain airborne for hours ( these concepts and their relevance to influenza viruses are discussed in [ 1 , 3 ‚Äì 14 ] ) . Presently , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) state that influenza virus trans - mission occurs mostly by large - particle respiratory droplets that travel only a short distance from the source ( 1 . 829 m ( 6 feet ) according to the CDC and 1 m ( 3 . 3 feet ) according to the WHO ) [ 15 ‚Äì 17 ] . Noteworthy , deposition of influenza virus into the lungs ( as small particles ) versus the upper respiratory tract ( as large droplets ) may increase infection risk and illness severity [ 3 , 9 , 18 ‚Äì 20 ] . Assessments of microbiological air quality are useful for studies of the airborne transmission of pathogens and of other biological particles in the air that may cause noninfectious diseases ( such as allergy to pollen ) . The two principle meth - ods of assessing microbiological air quality are passive moni - toring and active sampling [ 21 ] . Both methods were designed for studies of airborne bacteria or fungi . Passive monitoring is typically performed using settle plates , which are opened and exposed to the air for a given time , then incubated and resulting bacterial and fungal colonies are analyzed . Active sampling is performed with a microbiological air sampler that mechanically draws a known volume of air over , or through , a particle collection device . The particles are subsequently removed from the collection medium and analyzed . Air samplers are also used to collect airborne viruses [ 22 ] , but it is difficult to do so primarily due to their small size and relatively low concentration in ambient air [ 23 ] . Also , most of the available bioaerosol samplers are not suitable for 2 Influenza Research and Treatment Intake air Stage A Stage B Stage C Stage D After - filter Pump Cutoff value 2 . 5 ‚Äì 10 . 0ùúá m 1 . 0 ‚Äì 2 . 5ùúá m 0 . 50 ‚Äì 1 . 0ùúá m 0 . 25 ‚Äì 0 . 50ùúá m < 0 . 25 ùúá m ( a ) Intake air Pump ( b ) Figure 1 : Sioutas Personal Cascade Impactor Sampler ( PCIS ) . ( a ) Schematic representation of the five interior sections of a PCIS . Each stage has an upper acceleration compartment and a lower impaction - collector surface . ( b ) Photograph of a PCIS unit . For size perspective , a coin is shown to the right of the PCIS . the collection of viruses for reasons that include ( a ) they typically run for short periods of time ( min ) , making it difficult to capture large volumes , ( b ) most do not separate particles by size , and ( c ) , they are inefficient at collecting submicron particles [ 23 ‚Äì 25 ] . The PCIS [ 26 ] separates airborne particles in a cascading fashion and simultaneously collects the size - fractionated particles by impaction on polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) filters . It has collection filters on four impaction stages ( A ‚Äì D ) , and optionally , an after - filter can be added onto a 5th stage . The PCIS is designed to separate and collect airborne particulate matter above the cutpoint of five size ranges : > 2 . 5 ùúá m ( Stage A ) , 1 . 0 to 2 . 5 ùúá m ( Stage B ) , 0 . 50 to 1 . 0 ùúá m ( Stage C ) , 0 . 25 to 0 . 50 ùúá m ( Stage D ) , and < 0 . 25 ùúá m ( collected on an after - filter ) ( Figure 1 ) . PTFE filters , better known as Teflon filters , can collect particles at high efficiency above the cutpoints without the need for coatings [ 26 ] . Coatings can also reduce the recovery efficiency of viable virus . Lastly , for the efficient collection of airborne influenza virus , the filters are not prewetted with methanol prior to use [ 24 ] . The SKC BioSampler collects unfractionated airborne particles in liquid media [ 27 ] . Made out of glass , the SKC BioSampler is purpose - designed to collect particles of a size range that would go through human nasal passages . The SKC BioSampler has three 0 . 630 mm tangential sonic nozzles ; air passing through the nozzles creates a swirling flow of collection medium during sampling . Compared to other impingers , particle skip and damage to the collected microbial agent are potentially minimized by the collection swirling liquid . Whereas the SKC BioSampler has worked well for the collection of airborne bacteria and fungi in the field , it is nevertheless inefficient at recovering submicrometer and ultrafine virus aerosols , with collection efficiencies of < 10 % for particles in the 30 to 100 nm size range [ 28 ] . Nevertheless , mostly because significantly better alternative devices are not readily available , the SKC BioSampler has been used for the collection of airborne influenza virus [ 23 , 29 ‚Äì 31 ] . An adult and a child living in an apartment in Gainesville , Florida , were diagnosed with influenza caused by type A influenza virus . As both occupants had been vaccinated against influenza A and B viruses in November of 2012 , there was a possibility that they were infected with a new influenza virus strain significantly different than from those in the vaccines . We ( opportunistically ) evaluated airborne material from the apartment that had been collected on PCIS filters and in SKC BioSampler liquid collection media for the presence of viable influenza A virus and / or viral genomic RNA . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Study Site . The dwelling that was evaluated in this report is a single - family four - bedroom apartment in Gainesville , Florida , USA , that has its own heating , ventilation , and air conditioning ( HVAC ) system . Passive air exchange with the outside was minimal , as windows and an entry door were kept closed due to cold weather . 2 . 2 . Metrology . Relative humidity ( RH ) and temperature ( ùëá ) were measured using an electronic NIST traceable RH and ùëá meter ( ThermoFisher , catalog number 11 - 661 - 19 ) . 2 . 3 . Laboratory . Virology work was performed in a biosafety level 2 - enhanced laboratory at the University of Florida . Influenza Research and Treatment 3 2 . 4 . SKC BioSamplers . The SKC ( SKC , Inc . , Eighty Four , PA , USA ) BioSampler ( SKC catalog number 225 - 9595 ) is a widely - used device for microbiological air quality assess - ments . SKC BioSamplers were operated with 115 volt Vac - U - Go sampling pumps ( SKC , Inc . , catalog number 228 - 9605 ) . The pumps were warmed up by running them for 5 min prior to use . To protect the pumps against moisture , in - line vapor traps ( SKC Inc . , catalog number 225 - 22 - 01 ) were connected between the SKC BioSamplers and sampling pumps . SKC BioSamplers were sterilized by autoclaving prior to use then filled with 15 mL of sterile phosphate buffered saline with calcium and magnesium ( PBS ) , 0 . 5 % w / v purified BSA fraction V ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY , USA ) , and 0 . 25 % ( v / v ) molecular - grade antifoam agent B ( Sigma - Aldrich , Inc . , St . Louis , MO , USA ) for virus collection [ 9 ] . The operating pressure was measured using the pump‚Äôs built - in manometer ( pressure gauge ) ; the sampling flow rate was 12 . 5 L / min , determined using a flow meter attached to the inlet of the SKC BioSampler prior to use . This suggested that the SKC BioSampler was operating normally , because at normal atmospheric conditions , the flow rate should always be around 12 . 5 L / min when there is a pressure drop of at least 0 . 5 atm . For each unit , a collection time of 30 min was used to sample approximately 375 liters ( 0 . 375 m 3 ) of air . 2 . 5 . Sioutas Personal Cascade Impactor Sampler ( PCIS ) . The PCIS ( SKC , Inc . , catalog number 225 - 370 ) units were used with Leland Legacy pumps ( SKC , Inc . , cat number 100 - 3002 ) and operated at a flow rate of 9 L / min . Polytetrafluoroethy - lene ( PTFE ) filters ( 25 mm , 0 . 5 ùúá m pore , SKC , Inc . catalog number 225 - 2708 ) were used for the collection stages . PTFE after - filters ( 37 mm , 2 . 0 ùúá m pore , SKC Inc . , catalog number 225 - 1709 ) were used with each run . The pump‚Äôs operating flow rate was calibrated by measuring volume displacement using a Defender Primary Standard Calibrator ( SKC , Inc . , catalog number 717 - 510H ) . A collection time of 41 min 36 sec was used to sample approximately 0 . 375 m 3 of air . 2 . 6 . Positioning of Air Samplers . PCIS and SKC BioSam - pler units were tandemly situated beneath ceiling vents so that air samplings would be made in areas with active air - flow ( Figure 2 ) . The room doors within the apartment were completely open during the air sampling period . The intake openings of the air samplers were at a height of 1 m and perpendicular to the ground , facing the patients . For comparisons of indoor to outdoor counts , outside air was evaluated using a PCIS and an SKC BioSampler in a courtyard outside the apartment . 2 . 7 . Influenza Diagnosis . The patients , an adult female ( age 50 ) and young female ( age 10 ) , were diagnosed with influenza at a local clinic in early February 2012 . Nasal discharges from both were positive for influenza A virus using a Binax NOW Flu A and Flu B test ( Binax Inc . , Portland , ME , USA ) . The kit did not distinguish between influenza A types H1 or H3 . Both individuals exhibited classic signs of influenza , starting with a sudden onset fever ( 40 ‚àò C ) , quickly followed by body ache , chills , dry cough , headache , malaise , muscle ache , pain Door HVAC : heating , ventilation , and air - conditioning system Closet Ceiling vent AirÔ¨Çow to HVAC Couch Samplers positive for inÔ¨Çuenza virus Samplers negative for inÔ¨Çuenza virus Occupant with inÔ¨Çuenza , prone position Site of heaviest mold growth Bed Bedroom 1 Bedroom 2 Bedroom 3 Bedroom 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Kitchen HVAC Toilet TV Bathroom Bathroom Figure 2 : Schematic layout of the apartment unit of this study ( drawn to scale ) .

Less characteristically , the adult but not the child suffered from diarrhea during the first day of illness . The adult had been vaccinated against influenza by injection , and the child by inhaled vaccine , the previous November ( 2012 ) . Neither individuals had underlying health conditions and were otherwise healthy and physically fit . 2 . 8 . Initial Workup of SKC BioSampler Virus Collection Media . Within 30 min of collection , virus collection media in the SKC BioSamplers was concentrated to a volume of about 400 ùúá L by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra 15 filter units with a molecular - weight cut off of 100 kD ( Millipore , Bedford , MA , USA ) . The concentrated SKC BioSampler fluids were adjusted to a volume of 500 ùúá L by addition of PBS with 0 . 5 % w / v BSA fraction V , and were stored at ‚àí 80 ‚àò C . 4 Influenza Research and Treatment 2 . 9 . Initial Workup of PCIS Filters for Virus Workup . The PCIS filters for virus tests were individually scraped with flocked swabs wetted with PBS with 0 . 5 % w / v BSA fraction V then each swab eluted into separate 10 mL aliquots of PBS with 0 . 5 % w / v BSA fraction V . The eluates were individually concentrated to a volume of about 400 ùúá L by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra 15 filter units , the volume adjusted to 500 ùúá L by the addition of sterile PBS with 0 . 5 % w / v BSA fraction V and the concentrated PCIS fluids stored at ‚àí 80 ‚àò C . 2 . 10 . Cell Lines . MDCK ( CCL - 34 ) and Mv1 Lu ( CCL - 64 ) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( Manassas , VA , USA ) and were propagated as monolayers at 37 ‚àò C and 5 % CO 2 in Advanced Dulbecco‚Äôs Modified Eagle‚Äôs Medium ( aDMEM ) ( Invitrogen Corp . , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) supplemented with 2 mM L - Alanyl - L - Glutamine ( Glu - taMAX , Invitrogen Corp . ) , antibiotics ( PSN ; 50 ùúá g / mL peni - cillin , 50 ùúá g / mL streptomycin , 100 ùúá g / mL neomycin ( Invitro - gen Corp . ) ) , and 10 % ( v / v ) low IgG , heat - inactivated gamma - irradiated fetal bovine serum ( HyClone , Logan , Utah ) . MDCK - SIAT2 , 6 - UF and Mv1 Lu - SIAT2 , 6 - UF are cell lines prepared in this laboratory from the ATCC MDCK and Mv1 Lu cells and were propagated as described for ATCC cells . MDCK - SIAT2 , 6 - UF and Mv1 Lu - SIAT2 , 6 - UF overexpress influenza virus ùõº 2 , 6 - linked sialic acid receptors [ 32 ] . Prior to use , all cell lines were treated for 3 weeks with plasmocin and verified free of mycoplasma DNA by PCR [ 32 ] . 2 . 11 . Virus Isolation . Aliquots ( 50 ùúá L ) of concentrated fluids from the SKC BioSampler and PCIS filters were inoculated onto MDCK , Mv1 Lu [ 33 ] , MDCK - SIAT2 , 6 - UF , and Mv1 Lu - SIAT2 , 6UF in serum - free DMEM otherwise supplemented as previously described plus L - 1 - tosylamido - 2 - phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone ( TPCK ) - treated mycoplasma - and extraneous virus - free trypsin ( Worthington Biochemical Company , Lakewood , NJ ) in 5 % CO 2 at 33 ‚àò C . The TPCK - trypsin was used at a final concentration 2 ùúá g / mL for MDCK and MDCK - SIAT2 , 6 - UF cells and at 0 . 2 ùúá g / mL for Mv1 Lu - SIAT2 , 6 - UF cells . 2 . 12 . Rapid Detection of Influenza Virus in Cell Cultures . A commercial solid phase ELISA test ( QuickVue influenza A and B kit , Quidel Corp . , San Diego , CA , USA ) was used to quickly detect influenza virus in cell cultures . The test did not distinguish between influenza A virus types H1 and H3 . 2 . 13 . Identification of Influenza A Virus Type by RT - PCR . Viral RNA was extracted from Mv1 Lu cells using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit , and RT - PCR was performed using primers described in a WHO Manual for influenza Virus Diagnostics [ 34 ] . Briefly , vRNA was denatured for 5 min at 67 ‚àò C in the presence of SUPERase - In RNase inhibitor ( Invitrogen Corp . ) , cooled rapidly , and in separate reac - tions , first strand synthesis was performed with Omniscript reverse transcriptase ( RT ) ( Qiagen , Inc . ) for 1 hr at 37 ‚àò C with primers H1F1 ( 5 Û∏Ä† - AGCAAAAGCAGGGGAAAATAAAAG - C - 3 Û∏Ä† ) for influenza A ( H1N1 ) 2009 virus , THAF2 ( 5 Û∏Ä† - GCA - GGGGAAAATAAAAACAACC - 3 Û∏Ä† ) for former seasonal influenza A ( H1N1 ) , and H3A1F6 ( 5 Û∏Ä† - AAGCAGGGGATA - ATTCTATTAACC - 3 Û∏Ä† ) for influenza A ( H3N2 ) . PCR was performed using One Taq DNA polymerase ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA . USA ) . Primers H1F1 and H1R1264 ( 5 Û∏Ä† - CCTACTGCTGTGAACTGTGTATTC - 3 Û∏Ä† ) were used for influenza A ( H1N1 ) 2009 virus , with an expected product size of 1 , 264 bp , THAF2 , and SPHAR11 ( 5 Û∏Ä† - TATTTTGGGCAC - TCTCCTATTG - 3 Û∏Ä† ) for former seasonal influenza A ( H1N1 ) , with an expected product size of 990 bp , and H3A1F6 and H3A1R1 ( 5 Û∏Ä† - GTCTATCATTCCCTCCCAACCAT - 3 Û∏Ä† ) for influenza A ( H3N2 ) , with an expected product size of 1 , 127 bp . PCR was performed as initial denaturation step ; 94 ‚àò C ( 30 sec ) ; 30 cycles of 94 ‚àò C ( 30 sec ) , 46 ‚àò C ( 60 sec ) , and 68 ‚àò C ( 1 min 25 sec ) ; terminal extension step at 68 ‚àò C ( 5 min ) ; 4 ‚àò C ‚àû . Gel electrophoresis ( 1 . 5 % ethidium bromide - stained agarose gel ) was used to visualize the PCR product . 2 . 14 . Detection of Influenza Virus RNA in Collected Specimens . RNA was extracted from aliquots of concentrated SKC BioSampler and PCIS fluids using a QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit then subjected to RT - PCR analyses . Reverse transcription was performed with Omniscript RT using primer H3A1F6 , and PCR was performed as described above with primers H3A1F6 and H3A1R1 to generate a 1127 bp amplification product . 2 . 15 . Sequencing . The consensus sequences of the hemag - glutinin and neuraminidase genes of the virus isolated in this work ( designated A / Gainesville / 07 / 2013 ( H3N2 ) ) were determined from PCR amplicons . The vRNA was reverse transcribed using AccuScript High Fidelity Reverse Tran - scriptase ( Agilent Technologies , Inc . , Santa Clara , CA ) in the presence of SUPERase - In RNase inhibitor . PCR was performed using Phusion Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) with denaturation steps performed at 98 ‚àò C . A combination of primers mentioned in the WHO Manual for Influenza Virus Diagnostics [ 32 ] were used ( information to be provided upon request ) . The PCR amplicons were purified using a Qiaquick PCR purification kit ( Qiagen ) . Amplicon sequences were analyzed using an Applied Biosystem 3130 DNA analyzer by using BigDye Terminator ( v . 3 . 1 ) chemistry and the same used for amplifications . 2 . 16 . GenBank . The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene sequences of influenza virus A / Gainesville / 07 / 2013 ( H3N2 ) were deposited in GenBank ( accession numbers KF061021 and KF061022 ) . 2 . 17 . Plaque Assays . Plaque assays were performed as in [ 33 ] , though MDCK ( and not Mv1 Lu ) cells were used so that our results would be easier to compare and contrast with those of others ( since most laboratories use MDCK cells for influenza virus plaque assays ) . 3 . Results The RH of indoor air at the residence ranged from 44 to 45 % , and indoor ùëá ‚Äôs ranged from 21 to 23 ‚àò C during the testing period of this work .

Viable virus was successfully isolated from samplers located up to 3 . 7 m away from one of the sick occupants ( Table 1 ) . PCIS filters that yielded viable virus are given in Tables 2 and 3 . Only samplers located at sites 1 , 2 , and 3 , which were close to and in a direct path with sick individuals ( Figure 2 ) , collected RT - PCR detectable or viable virus . The PCIS collected a range of particle sizes containing influenza virus when it was 1 . 2 m away from the ill person resting on a couch ( at site 1 ) but presumably only fine to ultrafine particles ( ‚â§ 2 . 5 ùúá m ) at distances of 2 . 1 and 3 . 7 m away from the sick persons ( Table 3 ) . For each sample set , influenza virus - specific CPE were apparent earlier in MDCK - SIAT2 , 6 - UF and Mv1 Lu - SIAT2 , 6 - UF cells than in conventional MDCK and Mv1 Lu cells . An example is shown in Figure 3 for CPE ( granulation of the cytoplasm , enlargement of nuclei , followed by rounding of the cells and detachment from the growing surface ) three days postinfection of MDCK and MDCK - SIAT2 , 6 - UF cells that had been inoculated with eluate from the after - filter of a PCIS positioned at site 3 . However , for each sample wherein virus was isolated , CPE developed in all the cell types that were used by 6 days postinfection . A Quidel QuickVue Influenza A and B kit was used to quickly confirm the presence of virus in the cells . As observed by others [ 13 , 14 ] , virus was detected by RT - PCR in some samples wherein viable virus was not isolated ( Table 3 ) . RT - PCR analyses indicated that influenza A ( H3N2 ) had been isolated in cell culture , as primers for the detection of Table 3 : Approximate viral count in concentrated SKC BioSampler and PCIS collection media .

The virus that had been isolated was different from strains present in the laboratory , ruling out laboratory contamination . A simple BLAST homology search against sequences in GenBank as of 27 May 2013 indicated that the HA gene of influenza virus A / Gainesville / 07 / 2013 ( H3N2 ) was most similar to that of influenza virus ( A / Washington / 3262 / 2012 ( H3N2 ) ) . 6 Influenza Research and Treatment ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) Figure 3 : Early formation of influenza virus - specific CPE in cells inoculated with material collected by a PCIS at air sampling site 3 .

Discussion The RH within the apartment ( 44 - 45 % ) was within the optimal comfort level for humans ( 40 ‚Äì 60 % ) , and the interior ùëá was also comfortable . Various studies indicate that aerosol transmission of influenza virus is decreased at an RH greater than about 50 % , and that transmission of airborne influenza virus is best under cold and dry conditions ( [ 35 ] and references therein ) . Since the RH of the apartment was 44 - 45 % , and the ùëá was between 22 and 23 ‚àò C , we predicted that viable airborne virus would be detected , and this turned out to be the case . Viable ‚Äúlive‚Äù virus was present in the liquid collection media of the SKC BioSampler , and some but not all of the filters of the PCIS ( Table 3 ) . Prior to drawing conclusions , modeling is needed with in vitro generated influenza virus aerosols to determine if the results of Table 3 truly reflect a difference in collection efficiency between the SKC BioSam - pler and the PCIS . It is possible that a large proportion of the collected airborne virus was damaged during impaction with the PTFE filters , yet the actual airborne virus collection efficiency of the PCIS was higher than that of the SKC BioSampler . Alternatively , it is also possible that under a constantly flowing airstream during active sampling with a PCIS , that influenza virus collected on the PTFE filters gets desiccated ( and thus inactivated ) on the filters [ 23 ] . Whereas it is already acknowledged that influenza patients expel large droplets as they cough and sneeze , our findings suggest that influenza patients also produce small aerosol particles ( ‚â§ 5 ùúá m ) that contain viable virus . Viable virus was detected in areas close to the two patients but not in adjoining rooms separated by curved paths . Because fluid dynamics modeling was not used to study air - circulation in Influenza Research and Treatment 7 this work , it was not clear whether positioning of the samplers in a direct path to sick individuals was important ; perhaps the overriding factor was closeness to the persons . The hemagglutinin gene of influenza virus A / Gain - esville / 07 / 2013 ( H3N2 ) is essentially identical to that of A / Washington / 3262 / 2012 ( H3N2 ) ( GenBank Accession number CY141277 ) . It has less sequence homology to the corre - sponding gene of A / Gainesville / 01 / 2012 ( H3N2 ) ( GenBank Accession number KF142471 ) , which circulated in Gain - esville in 2012 . Since Florida and Washington are situated on opposite coasts of the USA , it is plausible that A / Gain - esville / 07 / 2013 ( H3N2 ) stemmed from someone who had traveled to Florida from the West coast . Sequence analyses of the other genes of A / Gainesville / 07 / 2013 ( H3N2 ) indicated that the virus was similar to other nonvariant H3N2 strains in circulation in the USA , suggesting influenza vaccines were not protective for the two patients of this report . These findings of this work are consistent with recent reports of influenza viruses in fine particle aerosols in the exhaled breath of influenza patients [ 13 , 14 ] , and col - lectively , these reports challenge the notion that influenza virus is only transmitted through mucous contact with large droplets .
