Increasingly , laboratories are creating their own banks of iPSCs derived from diverse donors . However , there are not yet standardized guidelines for qualifying these cell lines , i . e . , distinguishing between bona fide human iPSCs , somatic cells , and imperfectly reprogrammed cells . Here , we report the establishment of a panel of 30 iPSCs from CD34 + peripheral blood mononuclear cells , of which 10 were further differentiated in vitro into all three germ layers . We characterized these different cell types with commonly used pluripotent and lineage specific markers , and showed that NES , TUBB3 , and OTX2 cannot be reliably used as ectoderm differentiation markers . Our work highlights the importance of marker selection in iPSC authentication , and the need for the field to establish definitive standard assays .

Introduction Patient - derived induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) retain the genetic characteristics of the donor , exhibit self - renewal , and can be cryopreserved and differentiated into disease - relevant tissue types . These capabilities render iPSCs a highly versatile cellular model enabling a wide range of research studies and experimental designs . For examples , these cells may be used for identifying transcriptomic and metabolomic markers of drug efficacy , screening in drug discovery , and advancing regenerative medicine ( Avior et al . , 2016 ; Sterneckert et al . , 2014 ) . iPSCs are reprogrammed from somatic cells through the ectopic expression of defined transcription factors such as POU5F1 ( aka OCT4 ) , SOX2 , KLF4 , and c - MYC ( also known as the Yamanaka factors ) ( Takahashi and Yamanaka , 2006 ) . Since the process of reprogramming may be incomplete , thus generating heterogeneous cell populations , it is essential to validate the quality of iPSC lines generated , and to distinguish bona fide iPSCs from partially reprogrammed cells ( Chan et al . , 2009 ) . This interrogation includes confirming expression of pluripotency factors , for example POU5F1 or TRA - 1 – 60 , and also displaying the ability to differentiate into the three germ layers : endoderm , mesoderm , and ectoderm ( Chan et al . , 2009 ) . Demonstration of germ layer differentiation has traditionally been performed through a teratoma assay , in which cells considered to be pluripotent would be injected into an immunocompromised mouse , and tested for their ability to create a teratoma with cells from all three germ layers . However , as this assay is labor intensive , costly and time - consuming , in vitro trilineage differentiation , in which specialized media is used to induce lineage - directed differentiation , has become a highly popular alternative ( Buta et al . , 2013 ; Vallier et al . , 2009 ) . A wide range of markers has been reported in the literature to be indicative of the three germ layers . Commonly used endoderm markers include SOX17 ( Kanai - Azuma et al . , 2002 ) , FOXA2 ( Burtscher and Lickert , 2009 ) , CXCR4 ( D’Amour et al . , 2005 ) , and GATA4 ( Fujikura et al . , 2002 ) . NCAM1 ( Evseenko et al . , 2010 ) and TBXT ( aka brachyury ) ( Wilkinson et al . , 1990 ) are often used as mesoderm markers . NES ( nestin ) ( Lendahl et al . , 1990 ) and PAX6 ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) are among the most commonly used markers for ectoderm differentiation . Here we report that several of the ectoderm markers commonly used during validation studies are not specific to ectoderm as there is a high degree of staining in undifferentiated iPSCs derived from CD34 + peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) . These studies highlight the need for further development of iPSC validation protocols . Kuang et al . Page 2 Stem Cell Res . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2019 June 14 .

Donors and samples The iPSCs used to obtain data reported here were generated as part of the Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ( POST ) Center within the Pharmacogenomics Research Network . Blood samples were drawn from donors recruited at Kaiser Permanente Northern California ( Table 1 ) . Written informed consent was obtained from all study subjects , and studies were performed in accordance with all relevant regulatory guidelines . This study was approved by the IRBs at Kaiser Permanente Northern California and the UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospitals . 2 . 2 . PBMC isolation After 1 : 1 dilution in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline containing 2 % Fetal Bovine Serum ( FBS , Omega Scientific , Cat . # FB - 02 , Lot # 8462 ) whole blood from each donor was layered over a Ficoll - Pacque gradient ( Fisher Scientific , Cat . # 45001750 ) in SepMate - 50 tubes ( StemCell Technologies , Cat . # 85460 ) and centrifuged at 1200 ×g for 20 min . PBMCs were decanted into a separate tube , washed in PBS supplemented with 2 % FBS , and centrifuged for an additional 10 min at 500 × g . PBMC were resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 20 % FBS and 10 % DMSO , and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen . 2 . 3 . iPSC generation PBMC aliquots were thawed and resuspended in StemSpan SFEM II expansion media ( StemCell Technologies , Cat . # 09605 ) with CD34 + expansion supplement ( StemCell Technologies , Cat . # 02691 ) . Cells were seeded into an Ultra - Low Attachment 6 - well plate ( Corning , Cat . # 3471 ) . After 6 days , the CD34 + cells were counted and up to 1 million cells were reprogrammed using a combination of plasmids purchased from Addgene encoding for POU5F1 , and shRNA for TP53 ( ID : 27077 ) SOX2 , and KLF4 ( ID : 27078 ) , L - MYC , and LIN28 ( ID : 27080 ) , and EBNA1 ( ID : 37624 ) ( Okita et al . , 2013 ) .

Immunostaining and flow cytometry analyses 80 % confluent cells were detached from the plates into single cell suspension using Accutase ( StemCell Technologies , Cat . # 07920 ) . Cells were washed in DPBS , then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS and incubated for 15 min . Fixed cells were washed with DPBS , resuspended with DPBS + 1 % BSA , and stored at 4 °C for up to 7 days prior to analysis . For intracellular markers , fixed cells were treated with Permeabilization Buffer ( eBioscience , Cat . # 00 - 8333 - 56 ) . Cells were transferred to Falcon 96 - well V bottom plates ( Fisher Scientific , Cat . # 08772212 ) for immunostaining . Antibody incubations were performed on ice in the dark for 45 min in 100 ul / well of CAS - Block ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Cat . # 008120 ) supplemented with 1 % BSA and 5 % goat serum ( plus 0 . 2 % Triton for intracellular markers ) . Cells were then washed twice with 200 ul / well DPBS ( cell surface markers ) or Permeabilization Buffer ( intracellular markers ) before resuspended in 100 ul / well DPBS + 1 % BSA .

Quantitative PCR with the Taqman ™ primers POU5F1 ( Thermofisher , Cat . # 4448892 ) , PAX6 ( Thermofisher , Cat . # 4448892 ) , NES ( Thermofisher , Cat . # 4448892 ) , TUBB3 ( Thermofisher , Cat . # 4448892 ) , and OTX2 ( Thermofisher , Cat . # 4448892 ) was carried out by a liquid handling robotic system and run via Quantstudio 12K Flex ( serial number : 285880333 ) . 2 . 10 . Statistical analysis Two - tailed paired t - tests were used to determine statistically significant differences between cell types . Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Generation and validation of blood - derived human iPSCs The CD34 + PBMC isolated from 30 individuals were nucleofected by episomal vectors expressing POU5F1 , SOX2 , KLF4 , L - MYC , LIN28 , EBNA1 , and shRNA for TP53 ( Okita et al . , 2013 ) . This integration - free approach minimizes genetic manipulation of the iPSCs . After emergence of colonies with distinct iPSC morphology ( i . e . embryonic stem cell - like compact colonies comprised of cells with large nuclei and well - defined borders ( Chan et al . , 2009 ) ) , TRA - 1 – 60 expressing cells were selected using Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting ( MACS ) to obtain one iPSC line per donor in a pooled culture ( Yang et al . , 2015 ) . Compared to clonally derived iPSCs , this method has been shown to be more efficient , potentially better standardized , and less variable than clonal selection . To confirm the identity of the established iPSC lines , colonies were subject to live staining of alkaline phosphatase ( AP , Fig . 1A ) or SSEA - 4 expression ( Fig . 1B ) . In addition , expression of pluripotency markers POU5F1 and TRA - 1 – 60 , and the differentiation marker SSEA - 1 , were quantified by immunostaining and flow cytometry in all 30 iPSC lines . Of the cells within an individual line , 91 . 3 % ( range 73 . 2 – 96 . 9 % ) were positive for POU5F1 expression , 93 . 3 % ( range 77 . 6 – 98 . 9 % ) were positive for TRA - 1 – 60 , and 2 . 7 % ( range 0 . 2 – 4 . 9 % ) were positive for SSEA - 1 ( Fig . 1C and S1 ) . All lines were > 90 % positive for POU5F1 and / or TRA - 1 – 60 , and < 5 % were positive for SSEA - 1 . Karyotype analyses of three representative lines showed no genetic abnormalities ( Fig . 1D ) . Five iPSC lines ( including 3 of the 10 lines underwent in vitro trilineage differentiation ) were also tested by PluriTest and KaryoStat , and all of them were found to be pluripotent with no chromosomal aberrations ( Fig . S2 ) . 3 . 2 . Validation of iPSCs via in vitro trilineage differentiation Next , to confirm the pluripotency of the iPSC lines , we performed a trilineage differentiation assay on 10 lines using the STEMdiff Trilineage Differentiation kit . To authenticate generation of each lineage , endoderm differentiated cells were stained for SOX17 and FOXA2 , mesoderm cells were stained for NCAM1 , and ectoderm cells were stained for NES , with the degree of immunostaining quantified by flow cytometry . Matched iPSCs , from whom the differentiated cells were derived , were also stained for lineage specific Kuang et al . Page 5 Stem Cell Res . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2019 June 14 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t markers as negative controls . After differentiation , cellular morphology was dramatically altered from the typical iPSC phenotype , Fig . S3 . Importantly , after directed endoderm differentiation , we found evidence of both SOX17 and FOXA2 positive cells in each of the 10 lines tested , with on average46 . 3 % ( range 10 – 75 . 7 % ) of cells / line expressing SOX17 , and 45 . 3 % ( range 14 . 8 – 68 . 9 % ) of cells / line expressing FOXA2 ( Fig . 2A and Fig . S4 ) . On average 84 % ( range 26 . 6 – 99 . 5 % ) of cells / line were NCAM1 positive after directed mesoderm differentiation ( Fig . 2A and Fig . S4 ) . For both the endoderm and mesoderm markers , we observed little to no staining of the undifferentiated iPSC lines ( 2 . 0 % positive cells / marker / line on average ) . After directed differentiation into ectoderm , we observed a high degree of NES positive cells ( 90 % , range 62 . 2 – 99 . 2 % positive cells / line ) . However , surprisingly a similar number of NES positive cells were also detected in the undifferentiated iPSCs ( 96 . 5 % , range 89 . 6 – 98 . 7 % positive cells / line ) . To test the consistency of this result , we repeated the analysis using a second antibody against NES that was derived from a different clone , and found similarly very high levels of NES positive cells / line in both the ectoderm and undifferentiated iPSC lines ( Fig . 2A and Fig . S4 ) . Since NES is a commonly used ectoderm marker , we performed a verification study in which an independent lab tested NES expression in an independent iPSC line before and after ectoderm differentiation using several NES antibodies . Again , the undifferentiated iPSC line had > 80 % NES positive cells / line , with the degree of staining indistinguishable between the differentiated and undifferentiated cells ( Fig . S5 ) . Based on these results , we next sought to test whether other commonly reported ectoderm markers may have similar non - specific staining patterns . Since the ectoderm differentiation medium tested creates neuroectoderm like cells , we assessed TUBB3 ( aka TUJ1 ) , OTX2 , and PAX6 . Similar to our observations with NES , we found high levels of TUBB3 and OTX2 positive cells in iPSC lines before and after differentiation , with no difference in their levels between the iPSC and ectoderm lines ( Fig . 2A and Fig . S4 ) . In contrast , while the number of PAX6 positive cells / line was relatively low ( 12 . 2 % , range 0 . 7 – 40 . 9 % ) after ectoderm directed differentiation , it was statistically significantly higher than in the undifferentiated iPSC lines ( 0 . 1 % , range 0 – 0 . 9 % , p = . 03 ) . We confirmed our findings by performing co - immunostaining of the pluripotency marker POU5F1 with either NES , TUBB3 , OTX2 , or PAX6 in undifferentiated iPSCs . While pluripotent iPSCs ( i . e . POU5F1 positive cells ) express various levels of NES , TUBB3 , and OTX2 protein , we found no detectable PAX6 expression ( Fig . 2B and Fig . S6 ) . In the absence of a robust ectoderm - specific marker , to validate that the ectoderm directed differentiation was successful at yielding the expected cell type , we performed qPCR of POU5F1 and the four commonly used ectoderm markers we tested . Transcript levels of pluripotent marker POU5F1 are known to be reduced after ectoderm differentiation ( Daily et al . , 2017 ) , and as expected , these were reduced by 92 ± 2 % ( P < . 001 ) ( Fig . 2C ) . Of the four candidate ectoderm markers ( NES , TUBB3 , OTX2 , and PAX6 ) , we found significantly elevated expression levels of OTX2 ( 11 . 6 ± 2 . 6 fold increase , P < . 0001 ) and PAX6 ( 1143 . 5 ± 592 . 5 fold increase , P < . 0001 ) after ectoderm differentiation ( Fig . 2D ) . To ensure that the expression profile was not impacted by the cell type the iPSCs were originated from , we examined our RNAseq data from six fibroblasts - derived and two CD34 + cell - derived iPSC Kuang et al .

S7 ) . 4 . Discussion The use of iPSC lines in biomedical research has increased exponentially in recent years . However , as this technology remains under development , the lack of standardized guidelines for validating whether newly established human iPSCs are bona fide lines remains a challenge in the field . For example , while teratoma assays were once considered the gold standard for authenticating new lines , recent studies have called into question whether these time - consuming and expensive as - says are still necessary ( Buta et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , while traditional iPSC lines were established from fibroblasts derived from skin biopsies , more recently generation of iPSC lines from blood derived cells has grown in popularity due to the ease of primary cell isolation . Here , we report that during authentication of a newly established iPSC repository generated from blood derived cells , we discovered that many of the commonly used markers for ectoderm show high levels of expression in undifferentiated iPSC lines . Using cell lines from 10 donors , we found comparable levels of NES , TUBB3 , and OTX2 in iPSCs with and without differentiation . For NES specifically ( one of the most commonly reported ectoderm markers ) , we tested multiple antibodies in multiple cell lines across two independent laboratories , and found similar high degrees of staining in the undifferentiated state . Based on these findings , we conclude that NES , TUBB3 and OTX2 are not ectoderm specific markers . Notably , NES and OTX2 are currently recommended in the STEMDiff Trilineage Differentiation Kit and Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Functional Identification Kit ( R & D Systems ) as ectoderm markers , respectively . Although we failed to identify a difference in NES transcript levels between undifferentiated iPSCs and differentiated ectoderm cells , Hoffman et al . ( 2017 ) previously reported that NES transcript levels are elevated in neural progenitor cells ( NPCs ) compared to undifferentiated iPSCs , suggesting that NES may be a suitable neuroectoderm marker . Notably , NPCs are at a more differentiated state compared to the ectoderm that we characterized here . Through NES immunocytochemistry of iPSCs and NPCs we found that iPSCs do express detectable level of NES protein , but to a much lower extent than NPCs ( Fig . S8 ) . Thus , when using relatively insensitive methods such as immunohistochemistry , this difference in expression levels may be leveraged to enable use of NES expression as a NPC marker . However , flow cytometry is substantially more sensitive and quantitative compared to immunocytochemistry , and in particular , is able to distinguish even low levels of NES signal compared to an IgG incubated control . Based on our findings , investigators should avoid NES as an ectoderm marker when using immunostaining and flow cytometry to access trilineage differentiation efficiency . Furthermore , care is advised if using NES as a neuroectoderm marker . In the case of TUBB3 , RNAseq data made available by Daily et al . also shows no evidence of increased transcript levels in ectoderm differentiated cells compared to stem cell lines ( Daily et al . , 2017 ) . These findings are consistent with our results indicating that while Kuang et al . Page 7 Stem Cell Res . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2019 June 14 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t TUBB3 is widely used as a marker for neuronal differentiation , it is not suitable as an ectoderm marker in iPSC trilineage validation studies . Interestingly , we found that while OTX2 transcript levels were significantly upregulated after ectoderm differentiation , the degree of cell surface protein expression in the undifferentiated iPSCs rendered this protein non - useful as an ectoderm marker . Thus , validation of new markers at the protein level must be tested irrespective of whether differences are observed at the mRNA level . Of the markers tested , PAX6 was the only ectoderm marker that showed increased expression in the differentiated versus undifferentiated cells . While the overall percent positive cells / line was relatively low , consistent with the wide range of differentiation capacity reported among iPSCs ( Carcamo - Orive et al . , 2017 ; Kajiwara et al . , 2012 ; Kilpinen et al . , 2017 ; Kyttala et al . , 2016 ) , it is possible that with further modification to the protocol , such as changing cell seeding density , greater staining could be obtained . In addition , it has been reported that further differentiating the cells from ectoderm to NPCs using SMAD signaling pathway inhibitors increases NES and PAX6 transcript and protein levels ( Chambers et al . , 2009 ; Hoffman et al . , 2017 ) . A caveat of our study is that we only rigorously tested trilineage differentiation using the STEMdiff Trilineage Differentiation Kit . Thus , it would be of interest to assess whether other commercially available kits and reported protocols yield similar results . In summary , we have shown that NES , TUBB3 , and OTX2 cannot be reliably used as ectoderm differentiation markers when flow cytometry is utilized for measurement . These findings also highlight the importance of including relevant negative controls during validation studies . Investigators should be cautious in selecting markers until definitive standard assays for iPSC pluripotency are established .
