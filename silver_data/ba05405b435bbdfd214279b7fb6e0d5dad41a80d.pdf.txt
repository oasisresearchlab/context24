BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2022 ) 22 : 481 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s12879 - 022 - 07461 - 9 RESEARCH Seroprevalence and characteristics of Coronavirus Disease ( COVID - 19 ) in workers with non - specific disease symptoms Wajiha Javed , Syed Hussain Baqar Abidi * and Jaffer Bin Baqar Abstract Background : The population - based serosurveys are essential for estimating Coronavirus Disease - 19 ( COVID - 19 ) burden and monitoring the progression of this pandemic . We aimed to assess the seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies and potential predictors of seropositivity in the Pakistani population . Methodology : This population - based seroprevalence study includes consenting subjects from the workplaces ( factories , corporates , restaurants , media houses , schools , banks , and hospitals ) located in the urban areas of Karachi , Lahore , Multan , Peshawar , and Quetta . We analyzed each subject’s serum sample for SARS - CoV - 2 - IgM and / or IgG anti - bodies using UNIPER IgG / IgM Rapid COVID - 19 Testing Kit . The subject’s demographics , exposure history , and symp - toms experienced ( in last 7 days ) were also obtained . The collected data was analyzed using SPSS version 22 . 0 . Results : The overall seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies was 16 . 0 % ( 2810 / 17 , 764 ) . The total antibody seroposi - tivity was higher in males than females ( OR 1 . 22 , 95 % CI 1 . 110 – 1 . 340 ) . The symptomatic subjects had 2 . 18 times higher odds of IgG seropositivity while 1 . 2 times for IgM seropositivity than the asymptomatic subjects . The multivariable logistic regression model showed that the odds of SARS - CoV - 2 total antibody seroprevalence were affected by the number of dependents ( OR = 1 . 077 ; 95 % CI 1 . 054 – 1 . 099 ) , apparent symptomology ( OR = 1 . 288 ; 95 % CI 1 . 011 – 1 . 643 ) , close unprotected contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID - 19 ( OR 2 . 470 ; 95 % CI 2 . 164 – 2 . 819 ) , traveling history ( last 14 days ) ( OR = 1 . 537 ; 95 % CI 1 . 234 – 1 . 914 ) and proximity with someone who traveled ( OR = 1 . 534 ; 95 % CI 1 . 241 – 1 . 896 ) . Conclusion : We found a reasonable seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies in the studied population . Several factors like the number of dependents , apparent symptoms , close unprotected contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID - 19 , traveling history , and proximity with someone who traveled are associated with increased odds of SARS - CoV - 2 antibody seropositivity .

Introduction After emerging from Wuhan , the novel Coronavirus has rapidly transmitted throughout the world . It is now regarded as a pandemic [ 1 ] , accompanied by a varying range of mild symptoms including cough , fever , cold and body ache and even severe , like Acute Severe Respira - tory Distress ( ASRD ) become the leading cause of death among these patients [ 2 – 4 ] . According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) reports , we now have more than 296 million confirmed COVID - 19 cases and more than 5 million deaths worldwide [ 5 ] . Locally in Pakistan , the first two cases were reported in February 2020 , hav - ing a travel history from Iran . Although all preventive Open Access * Correspondence : hussain . baqar @ getzpharma . com Getz Pharma ( PVT ) Limited , Karachi , Pakistan Page 2 of 8 Javed et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2022 ) 22 : 481 measures were taken to contain the disease , unfortu - nately , around 1 , 301 , 141 cases have been identified since then , accounting for 28 , 961 deaths [ 6 ] . But the concern regarding disease control , morbidity , and mortality in Pakistan remains ; it is claimed that 415 , 352 cases have successfully recovered [ 6 ] , possibly due to low testing rates in Pakistan compared to the rest of the world [ 7 ] . One of the significant reasons for limited testing facilities is the restricted healthcare budget and resources [ 7 ] . As COVID - 19 has become a global threat , early detec - tion and prevention of viral spread have become cru - cial . Reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) is recognized as the gold standard diagnostic technique as it helps in the early recognition of COVID - 19 [ 8 ] . Although , due to compromised test sensitivity in association with inadequate sample collection , the time between sample collection , the onset of symptoms , and the fluctuation in viral load [ 9 ] linger the duration . However , an easy , sensitive , and inexpensive alternate , i . e . , Antibody Test , is now being used to identify SARS - COV - 2 . Antibody screening through serological assays helps determine the actual frequency and seroprevalence of the virus [ 10 ] . The antibodies IgG and IgM can be detected within 1 – 3 weeks after exposure to Coronavi - rus . A rapid increase in the antibody level and the sero - conversion rate is observed during the first two weeks [ 11 ] . Presently the seroconversion rate is being widely studied in order to understand its dynamics , specifically from acute to convalescent phases [ 12 ] . It has been found that the IgM and IgA growth after exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 is relatively slow compared to other acute viral infections contributing to its heterogeneous pathogenic - ity [ 13 ] . Old age , pre - existing comorbid conditions , low CD3 + CD8 + T - cells levels , high troponin I and d - dimer levels have been recognized as the major risk factors associated with seropositivity and mortality among the infected patients [ 14 – 17 ] . More recently , studies con - ducted in Shenzhen , including 1286 close contacts ( 98 COVID positive cases ) and Guangzhou including 2098 close contacts ( 134 COVID positive cases ) , discovered that significant risk factors for COVID - 19 infection were among older age and traveling outside or inside the coun - try , etc [ 18 , 19 ] . Additionally , a Taiwanese study identified exposure to a confirmed or probable case of COVID - 19 as a risk factor [ 20 ] . In the current study , we employed a large dataset , including 17 , 764 participants from Karachi , Lahore , Mul - tan , Peshawar , and Quetta , to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies , characteristics , and potential predictors of seropositivity . This serological investigation intends to elaborate Pakistan’s COVID infection statistics under the worldwide pandemic . Methodology Study design & participants A population - based study was conducted to investigate the seroprevalence of COVID - 19 infection in Pakistan . Sample size was calculated on standard assumptions , which are , 95 % confidence interval with 5 % margin of error and considering 50 % estimated prevalence of COVID - 19 during the first wave of pandemic . With these assumptions we had sample size n = 384 for a sin - gle center . We aimed to cover approx . 40 centers across Pakistan and achieved a well representative sample size n = 17 , 764 for final analysis . Participants between 18 to 65 years of age were recruited during April - September 2020 from the workplaces , including factories , corpo - rates , restaurants , media houses , schools , banks , and hos - pitals , located in Karachi , Lahore , Multan Peshawar , and Quetta through non - probability convenience sampling technique . While non - consenting individuals , PCR - pos - itive at the time of screening , having past 14 - days history of COVID - 19 and COVID - 19 vaccine trials’ participants were excluded . Primary & secondary endpoints The primary endpoint was to assess the seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies ( IgM and IgG ) among the studied individuals . And the secondary endpoint was to determine the risk factors associated with the seroposi - tivity of these antibodies . Procedures & laboratory analysis For this population - based seroprevalence study , the patient’s baseline demographics , medical history , expo - sure information and details regarding the symptom profile of last 7 - days , seropositive rates and the factors associated with SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies were investi - gated at the time of sample collection and noted using a structured questionnaire . The samples were drawn for SARS - CoV - 2 rapid antibody testing in a temperature controlled environment by a healthcare professional . IgM and / or IgG antibodies were assessed from human serum using Unite Diagnostic Strip for N Coronavirus ( 2019 - nCoV ) IgG / IgM Antibody ( Colloidal Gold Immuno - chromatography Assay ) by Uniper Medical Technology Limited , approved by U . S . Food and Drug Administra - tion ( US FDA ) EUA and certified by European Certified ( C . E . ) . Statistical analysis The data were statistically analyzed using SPSS version 22 . 0 . Categorical variables , including gender , age groups , household size , medical history , symptom profile , contact history , etc . , were summarized as frequencies and per - centages . Moreover , mean and standard deviation were Page 3 of 8 Javed et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2022 ) 22 : 481 used for continuous variables like age , weight , and height . The seropositivity rate was calculated by the proportion of test - positive among those tested . Chi - square or Fisher exact test was used to compute the symptomatic associa - tion with antibody seropositivity . The Fitting Information Model was used to test the general fit of the model . More - over , the Multinomial logistic regression was applied to see the association between symptoms and antibodies . A multivariate logistic regression was performed , the IgM and IgG antibody’s significant predictors from Univariate analysis were entered into the final model . The forward Wald stepwise approach was used and the significant variables were determined as the independent predictors of seropositivity . A p - value < 0 . 05 was considered statisti - cally significant . Ethical considerations The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Review Board of AEIRC ( Reference no . MU / ECA / 20 / 17820 ; Dated 2nd April 2020 ) . All the procedures were per - formed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki , and the patient’s confidentiality was maintained through - out the investigation . The included patients were well - informed about the study objective and written informed consent was taken from them before inclusion . Results Participant demographics and exposures A total of 17 , 764 individuals were included in the study , with a mean age of 35 . 68 ± 14 . 17 years ( Range : 18 to 65 years ) , and of them , 13 , 003 were males , and 4 , 761 were females ( Table 1 ) . Prevalence of SARS‑CoV‑2 antibodies Out of 17 , 764 subjects , only 2 , 810 ( 16 . 0 % ) cases had either or both IgM and IgG positive antibodies . 951 ( 5 . 4 % ) tested positive for IgG antibody , 982 ( 5 . 5 % ) tested positive for IgM antibody , while the remaining had both antibodies ( n = 877 ) . Symptomatology among study individual The data regarding COVID - 19 symptomatology for last 7 - days was collected before antibody testing . About 8 . 2 % of the study individuals experienced flu - like symptoms , fever ( 7 . 5 % ) , and cough ( 7 . 4 % ) . While among the less common were sore throat , headache , and fatigue ( Fig . 1 ) . Of the IgM seropositive patients , the most com - monly reported symptoms were fever ( 26 . 35 % ) , cough ( 23 . 39 % ) , and flu ( 23 . 02 % ) as shown in Table 2 . Whereas flu ( 56 . 29 % ) , cough ( 48 . 85 % ) , headache ( 40 . 37 % ) and sore throat ( 37 . 14 % ) were the most frequently reported symp - toms among IgG - positive cases .

BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2022 ) 22 : 481 The presence of symptoms showed higher odds of IgG seropositivity ( OR = 2 . 180 ; CI 1 . 65 – 2 . 88 ) as compared to that for IgM antibody ( OR = 1 . 190 ; CI 0 . 96 – 1 . 48 ) ( Table 3 ) . Factors associated with anti‑SARS‑CoV‑2 antibodies positivity in the studied population The odds of having IgM seropositivity were higher among males as compared to females ( 1 . 142 , 95 % CI 1 . 022 – 1 . 276 ) . While the OR = 1 . 006 ( 95 % CI 0 . 902 – 1 . 122 ) showed that the chances of IgG seropositivity were simi - lar in the two genders ( Table 4 ) . The odds of IgM and IgG seropositivity were similar among all age groups . In asso - ciation with the SARS - CoV - 2 total antibody , the model showed that close unprotected contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID - 19 ( OR = 2 . 437 ; 95 % CI 2 . 221 – 2 . 675 ) , reporting previous symptoms ( OR = 1 . 391 ; 95 % CI 1 . 152 – 1 . 680 ) and proximity with someone who traveled ( OR = 2 . 270 ; 95 % CI 1 . 955 – 2 . 636 ) gave increased odds of for positive antibodies . Age , gender , number of dependents , marital status , monthly income , comorbid conditions , close unprotected contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID - 19 travelling history ( outside or inside the country ) , and proximity with someone who traveled ( outside or inside the country in the last 14 days ) , were entered into the final model . In result , number of dependents , marital sta - tus , close unprotected contact with a confirmed or prob - able case of COVID - 19 and proximity with someone who traveled were found to be independent significant predic - tors of IgM seropositivity . The final model for IgG seropositivity included age , the number of dependents , smoker , monthly income , comorbid disease , BCG vaccine status , close unprotected contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID - 19 , travelling history ( outside or inside the country in last 14 days ) , and proximity with someone who travelled ( outside or inside the country in last 14 days ) ( Table 6 ) . No of dependent , smokers , BCG vaccine status , symp - tomatology , close unprotected contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID - 19 , travelling history , and proximity with someone who travelled were the inde - pendent significant predictors of IgG seropositivity . * Not Reported = Not available ( Missing data ) Table 1 ( continued ) Variables ( n = 17 , 764 ) Yes 791 ( 4 . 5 ) Not reported * 133 ( 0 . 7 ) Proximity with someone who travelled outside or inside the country in the last 14 days No 16 , 717 ( 94 . 1 ) Yes 916 ( 5 . 2 ) Not reported * 131 ( 0 . 7 ) Fig . 1 Symptom profile of the study subjects Page 5 of 8 Javed et al .

Discussion This is the first large - scale serological investigation of 2019 - nCoV in Pakistan to the best of our knowledge . As previously published , local studies targeted a spe - cific population or had a small sample size . A serosur - vey from Lahore included 154 policemen [ 21 ] ; similarly , the National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Mar - row Transplantation from Karachi published the data on SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence among 380 healthy blood donors [ 22 ] , and another included 1 , 675 health - care workers ( HCWs ) [ 23 ] . Moreover , the preprint data also represent seroprevalence in a limited sample size [ 24 , 25 ] . The current findings revealed that the overall seroprevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies ( IgG and / or IgM ) was 16 . 0 % , i . e . , 2 , 842 out of 17 , 764 inhab - itants had developed SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies . This fig - ure is significantly higher than that reported in Italy ( 11 . 0 % ) , i . e . , 6 , 30 , 000 confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 cases [ 26 ] . This high seroprevalence is consistent with other studies [ 27 – 31 ] , 9 . 7 % reported among 2 , 766 subjects from Switzerland ( 2020 ) [ 27 ] , 13 . 8 % among 674 from Spain ( 2021 ) [ 28 ] , 21 . 4 % of 380 healthy blood donors from Pakistan ( 2020 ) [ 24 ] and 23 % of 390 subjects from Italy ( 2020 ) [ 31 ] . The seroprevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 total anti - body was significantly higher among males ( OR 1 . 220 , 95 % CI 1 . 110 – 1 . 340 ) ( Table 4 ) . In contrast , no signifi - cant differences in the seroprevalence of COVID anti - bodies have been reported among males than females ( OR 1 . 2 , 95 % CI 0 . 8 – 1 . 8 ) , which is also evidently proven by the existing literature [ 26 , 32 , 33 ] . Further - more , we found no significant increase in the odds of SARS - CoV - 2 antibody seropositivity with respect to age ( OR 1 . 003 , 95 % CI 1 . 000 – 1 . 006 ) ( Table 4 ) . In con - trast , a study reported that the risk of seropositivity was lower among individuals ≤ 20 years of age than those aged > 60 years ( OR : 0 . 72 , 95 % CI : 0 . 60 – 0 . 87 ) [ 34 ] . In addition to age and gender , close unprotected con - tact with a confirmed or probable COVID - 19 case was also identified as a potential factor affecting the odds of seropositivity ( OR 2 . 437 , 95 % CI 2 . 221 – 2 . 675 ) ( Table 4 ) and also confirmed by the forward Wald stepwise logis - tic regression analysis , including the significant predic - tors of positive antibody in univariate analysis ( Tables 5 and 6 ) . As per the final observed model , number of dependents , symptomatology , closed unprotected con - tact with the COVID - 19 probable or confirmed case , travelling history , and proximity with someone who travelled were the independent significant predictors of seropositivity ( Table 7 ) . A study conducted by Rudberg et al . reported that the seropositivity was significantly affected by the patient - related work , i . e . , 21 % of the 1 , 764 subjects in patient contact vs . 9 % of the 305 sub - jects without patient contact ( OR 2 . 9 , 95 % CI 1 . 9 – 4 . 5 ) [ 35 ] . Moreover , the subjects with confirmed COVID Table 2 Seropositivity by COVID - 19 compatible symptoms Symptoms IgM seropositivity n ( % ) IgG seropositivity n ( % ) Flu 428 ( 23 . 02 ) 1029 ( 56 . 29 ) Fever 490 ( 26 . 35 ) 876 ( 7 . 92 ) Cough 435 ( 23 . 39 ) 893 ( 48 . 85 ) Dyspnea 102 ( 5 . 48 ) 145 ( 7 . 93 ) Anosmia 109 ( 5 . 86 ) 133 ( 7 . 27 ) Fatigue 343 ( 18 . 45 ) 646 ( 35 . 33 ) Myalgia 178 ( 9 . 57 ) 403 ( 22 . 04 ) Anorexia 112 ( 6 . 02 ) 152 ( 8 . 31 ) Expectoration 94 ( 5 . 05 ) 247 ( 13 . 51 ) Sore Throat 348 ( 18 . 71 ) 679 ( 37 . 14 ) Conjunctivitis 99 ( 5 . 32 ) 99 ( 5 . 41 ) GI Symptoms 160 ( 8 . 60 ) 480 ( 26 . 25 ) Confusion 86 ( 4 . 62 ) 111 ( 6 . 07 ) Dizziness 110 ( 5 . 91 ) 131 ( 7 . 16 ) Headache 266 ( 14 . 30 ) 738 ( 40 . 37 ) Hemoptysis 23 ( 1 . 23 ) 29 ( 1 . 58 ) Rhinorrhea 104 ( 5 . 59 ) 147 ( 8 . 04 ) Chest Pain 117 ( 6 . 29 ) 123 ( 6 . 72 ) Other Symptoms – 11 ( 0 . 60 ) Table 3 Associations between symptoms and seropositivity of SARS - CoV 2 antibodies * p - value < 0 . 05 is considered statistically significant Symptomatic IgM n ( % ) OR ( 95 % CI ) p‑value IgG n ( % ) OR ( 95 % CI ) p‑value Positive Negative Positive Negative No 96 ( 9 ) 971 ( 91 ) Ref . 0 . 107 55 ( 5 . 2 ) 1012 ( 94 . 8 ) Ref . 0 . 001 * Yes 1763 ( 10 . 6 ) 14 , 934 ( 89 . 4 ) 1 . 190 ( 0 . 96 – 1 . 48 ) 1773 ( 10 . 6 ) 14 , 924 ( 89 . 4 ) 2 . 180 ( 1 . 65 – 2 . 88 ) Page 6 of 8 Javed et al . BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2022 ) 22 : 481 patient contact had 1 . 4 times higher seropositivity odds than those who had non - COVID patient contact ( p < 0 . 05 ) [ 35 ] . As for clinical symptoms , we found that symptomatic participants had 2 . 18 times higher odds of IgG seroposi - tivity and 1 . 2 times higher IgM seropositivity than the asymptomatic participants ( Table 3 ) . The presence of symptoms was significantly associated with seropositiv - ity of IgG antibody and insignificant for the IgM anti - body . Interestingly , 9 % of the asymptomatic subjects showed IgM antibodies , and 5 . 2 % had IgG antibodies . Also supported by multiple other studies [ 24 , 26 ] , Vena et al . reported seropositivity among 8 . 6 % of the asymp - tomatic subjects , and a similar local study reported that 53 . 2 % of COVID positive HCWs were completely asymp - tomatic [ 26 ] . These findings indicated that non - apparent infections are common among healthy , active individuals . However , the seroprevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibod - ies was reportedly high among symptomatic individuals ( p < 0 . 05 ) . The most commonly reported symptoms of the IgM seropositive patients were fever , cough and flu . Whereas headache , flu , cough and sore throat were the most frequently reported symptoms among IgG - positive cases ( Table 2 ) . In contrast , a study described the strong - est association of symptoms like anosmia , ageusia , and fever with seropositivity of SARS - CoV - 2 antibody [ 35 ] . The present study’s findings have several implica - tions for pandemic management since a large propor - tion of COVID infected subjects remain asymptomatic , also supported by the current study findings . Hence , the actual numbers of confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 cases might be higher than those reported . Thus , we need to employ stringent screening strategies targeting the infectious spread beyond the current symptom - driven approach [ 36 ] . Furthermore , the study limitations must also be dis - cussed ; we analyzed the serum samples of only those who voluntarily decided to be tested ( workers from selective Table 4 Univariate analysis of the factors associated with SARS - CoV - 2 Antibodies * Significant at p ≤ 0 . 05 * * Reference category Predictors IgM antibody IgG antibody Total antibody OR 95 % CI p‑value OR 95 % CI p‑value OR 95 % CI p‑value Age ( years ) 1 . 010 1 . 006 – 1 . 012 0 . 001 * 1 . 004 1 . 001 – 1 . 007 0 . 011 * 1 . 003 1 . 000 – 1 . 006 0 . 024 * Gender ( Male ) 1 . 142 1 . 022 – 1 . 276 0 . 019 * 1 . 006 0 . 902 – 1 . 122 0 . 914 1 . 220 1 . 110 – 1 . 340 0 . 001 * Household size 1 . 006 0 . 999 – 1 . 013 0 . 105 1 . 000 0 . 993 – 1 . 008 0 . 909 1 . 001 0 . 995 – 1 . 008 0 . 735 No of dependents 1 . 073 1 . 053 – 1 . 093 0 . 001 * 1 . 065 1 . 045 – 1 . 085 0 . 001 * 1 . 063 1 . 047 – 1 . 080 0 . 001 * Smoker 1 . 129 0 . 979 – 1 . 303 0 . 096 0 . 739 0 . 627 – 0 . 871 0 . 001 * 1 . 069 0 . 946 – 1 . 209 0 . 283 Married 1 . 348 1 . 213 – 1 . 498 0 . 001 * 1 . 101 0 . 994 – 1 . 221 0 . 066 0 . 895 0 . 821 – 0 . 976 0 . 012 * Monthly income ( < 15 , 000 ) * * 15 , 000 – 30 , 000 1 . 278 1 . 003 – 1 . 629 0 . 047 * 0 . 956 0 . 740 – 1 . 235 0 . 73 1 . 208 0 . 980 – 1 . 489 0 . 077 31 , 000 – 50 , 000 1 . 097 0 . 828 – 1 . 453 0 . 518 0 . 867 0 . 643 – 1 . 169 0 . 35 0 . 991 0 . 991 – 0 . 776 0 . 944 51 , 000 – 75 , 000 1 . 404 1 . 072 – 1 . 838 0 . 014 * 1 . 246 0 . 944 – 1 . 644 0 . 121 1 . 355 1 . 074 – 1 . 711 0 . 011 * 76 , 000 – 150 , 000 1 . 471 1 . 155 – 1 . 873 0 . 002 * 1 . 443 1 . 132 – 1 . 841 0 . 003 * 1 . 514 1 . 232 – 1 . 861 0 . 001 * > 150 , 000 1 . 604 1 . 280 – 2 . 009 0 . 001 * 1 . 466 1 . 167 – 1 . 842 0 . 001 * 1 . 484 1 . 221 – 1 . 802 0 . 001 * Comorbid disease 1 . 444 1 . 186 – 1 . 757 0 . 001 * 1 . 244 1 . 011 – 1 . 531 0 . 039 * 1 . 226 1 . 029 – 1 . 462 0 . 023 * Recent history of malaria 1 . 465 0 . 947 – 2 . 265 0 . 086 0 . 955 0 . 569 – 1 . 603 0 . 861 1 . 253 0 . 845 – 1 . 856 0 . 262 BCG vaccine 0 . 928 0 . 820 – 1 . 049 0 . 231 0 . 778 0 . 690 – 0 . 877 0 . 001 * 0 . 907 0 . 818 – 1 . 006 0 . 064 Symptomatic 1 . 194 0 . 963 – 1 . 481 0 . 107 2 . 186 1 . 659 – 2 . 880 0 . 001 * 1 . 391 1 . 152 – 1 . 680 0 . 001 * Close unprotected contact with a confirmed or prob - able case of COVID - 19 2 . 835 2 . 550 – 3 . 151 0 . 001 * 2 . 693 2 . 419 – 2 . 997 0 . 001 * 2 . 437 2 . 221 – 2 . 675 0 . 001 * Traveled outside or inside the country in the last 14 days 1 . 871 1 . 547 – 2 . 263 0 . 001 * 1 . 956 1 . 618 – 2 . 364 0 . 001 * 1 . 890 1 . 602 – 2 . 230 0 . 001 * Proximity with someone who traveled 2 . 597 2 . 204 – 3 . 061 0 . 001 * 2 . 270 1 . 913 – 2 . 693 0 . 001 * 2 . 270 1 . 955 – 2 . 636 0 . 001 * Table 5 Multivariate Hierarchical Models for the association of predictors with IgM Seropositivity AOR Adjusted Odd Ratio * p - value < 0 . 05 is considered statistically significant Final model AOR 95 % CI p‑value No of dependents 1 . 075 1 . 050 – 1 . 101 0 . 001 * Married 1 . 227 1 . 030 – 1 . 460 0 . 022 * Close unprotected contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID - 19 2 . 387 2 . 060 – 2 . 765 0 . 001 * Proximity with someone who traveled outside or inside the country in the last 14 days 1 . 895 1 . 531 – 2 . 346 0 . 001 * Page 7 of 8 Javed et al .

Moreover , the prevalence estimates might have varied due to false serol - ogy test results and among elderly or immunosuppressed subjects . Hence , the data cannot be generalized to whole population and the objective was to determine the sig - nificant characteristics which are still difficult to predict due to varying and non - specific nature of Coronavirus disease . Conclusion In conclusion , the overall SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies ( IgG and / or IgM ) seroprevalence was 16 . 0 % . The multivari - ate model predicted that number of dependents , symp - tomatology , close unprotected contact with a confirmed or probable case of COVID - 19 , travelling history and proximity with someone who traveled are the significant independent predictors of total antibody seropositiv - ity in the studied population . More efforts concerning public health investigations for COVID - 19 on a regional and national level should be made to identify the par - ticular risks and outcomes related to SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence .
