Networks of actin filaments expand when branches form on the sides of preexisting actin filaments . Formation of these branches is mediated by actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex , an assembly of seven protein subunits . The Arp2 / 3 complex is inactive on its own , but interactions with proteins such as the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASp ) stimulate Arp2 / 3 complex to initiate branches . WASp proteins also connect extracellular signals to the assembly of branched actin filaments ( 1 ) . Researchers previously identified a region at the C terminus of the WASp protein that binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex to stimulate the nucleation of branched actin filaments ( 1 ) . This active part of WASp and related proteins is called the “ VCA ” domain and consists of a verprolin homology ( V ) region , which binds to actin monomers , as well as central ( C ) and acidic ( A ) regions , which bind Arp2 / 3 complex . The molecular pathways underlying the formation of branched actin filaments remain poorly understood , though it was originally assumed that a single VCA domain binds to each Arp2 / 3 complex . However , this proposed mechanism cannot account for several experimental observations such as the chemical cross - linking of VCA to multiple subunits of Arp2 / 3 complex or the much higher activity of VCA dimers than VCA monomers . Furthermore , dimers of GST - VCA bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex with a stoichiometry of two VCAs to one Arp2 / 3 complex ( 2 ) . Therefore , Padrick et al . proposed that two distinct VCA - binding sites exist on the Arp2 / 3 complex . Here , we confirm that two VCA domains bind to one Arp2 / 3 complex and describe a high - resolution crystal structure of VCA bound to one of the two sites on the Arp2 / 3 complex . We also characterize the thermodynamicandkineticpropertiesoftheinteractionsamongactinmonomers , actin filaments , VCAs , and the Arp2 / 3 complex , and propose the most likely pathway of actin branch formation .

The CA region from the C terminus of fission yeast WASp ( Wsp1p ) binds to fission yeast and bovine Arp2 / 3 complex with a stoichiometry of 2 to 1 and different affinities for the two sites ( K d s of 0 . 13 and 1 . 6 μ M for fission yeast Arp2 / 3 complex ) . We then determined the high - resolution crystal structure of Arp2 / 3 complex with bound VCA . Electron density maps showed only three residues of VCA associated with bovine Arp2 / 3 complex , but these structures were highly informative . They showed the C - terminal tryptophan and flanking glutamic acid residues of the A motif bound to the subdomain 3 of Arp3 . The tryptophan indole ring is sandwiched between two residues of Arp3 : Pro236 and the guanidinium moiety of Arg333 , which are Pro249 and Arg345 in fission yeast ( Fig . P1 A ) . To test the biological relevance of this binding site , we mutated the Pro249 and Arg345 residues of the fission yeast Arp3 protein and discovered that haploid cells depending on Arp3 with mutations P249M , P249A , or R345A are not viable . The Arp3 P249Y mutant and wild - type cells both grow at 32 and 25 °C , possibly because the tyrosine can replace the hydrophobic interaction between the proline and the C - terminal tryptophan of VCA . Thus the positive charge of Arg345 and the hydrophobicity of Pro249 , which bind the conserved C - terminal tryptophan of VCA , are essential for the biological function of Arp2 / 3 complex . The electron density maps have densities for two turns of α - helix at the barbed end of Arp3 both in the presence and absence of CA ( Fig . P1 A ) . A helix consisting of ARPC1 residues Ala297 to Ala309 from an adjacent complex occupies this density in the crystal ( 3 ) . We note that the amphipathic C helix of N - WASP has functionally significant residues similar to this ARPC1 insert helix , so we propose that the C helix occupies this site when VCA binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . P1 A ) . Next , we performed fluorescence intensity and anisotropy assays to characterize the interactions of CA and actin - VCA with the Arp2 / 3 complex , as well as the interactions of Arp2 / 3 complex with the sides of the actin filaments . Equilibrium binding , kinetic , and cross - linking experiments show that ( i ) when bound to high - affinity site 1 , CA inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex binding to actin filaments ; ( ii ) low - affinity site 2 has 40 - fold higher affinity for CA when the Arp2 / 3 complex is bound to actin filaments ; ( iii ) the Arp2 / 3 complex has a much higher affinity for free CA than for actin monomer - cross - linked VCA ; and ( iv ) the affinity of VCA cross - linked to actin monomer is similar to the affinity of free VCA for the actin filament - bound Arp2 / 3 complex . Fig . P1 C and D summarize the thermodynamic parameters measured in our experiments or calculated using detailed balance . The free energy changes associated with these reactions reveal striking positive and negative influences among the components that assemble branches — actin monomers , actin filaments , VCA , and Arp2 / 3 complex . We propose a pathway of actin filament branch formation that involves at least two structurally and functionally distinct interactions of CA with the Arp2 / 3 complex . This hypothesis is consistent with previous studies and our current thermodynamic , kinetic , and structural data , and should be further explored via kinetic and structural studies . According to our model , VCA from an activated WASp - family protein engages high - affinity site 1 on the Arp2 / 3 complex . This interaction may bring the Arp2 / 3 complex from the bulk cytoplasm to the membrane . Although site - 1 - bound VCA blocks the association of Arp2 / 3 complex with a mother filament , VCA exchanges rapidly on and off of site 1 . When VCA dissociates from site 1 , Arp2 / 3 complex associates with a mother filament , increasing the affinity of site 2 for actin - VCA by 40 - to 100 - fold , presumably by stabilizing the active conformation found in the branch junction . Actin - VCA then binds to site 2 on Arp3 with the A motif anchored by the conserved C - terminal tryptophan and the C motif in the barbed end groove of Arp3 . This orientation positions VCA to deliver the first actin subunit to the barbed end of Arp3 ( Fig . P1 B ) . Small - angle X - ray solution scattering ( 4 ) and chemical cross - linking ( 5 ) support the existence of a third VCA - binding site with C in the barbed end groove of Arp2 ( 1 ) and A associated with ARPC1 . Actin - VCA bound to this site is positioned to deliver the second actin subunit of the daughter filament to the barbed end of Arp2 ( 4 ) . Because of the capping activity of V ( 1 ) and the low nucleation activity VCA cross - linked to an actin monomer , dissociation of VCA from the first two actin subunits of the daughter filament is likely required for elongation of the branch . Successive interactions of VCA with Arp2 / 3 complex may provide cells with multiple opportunities to regulate actin filament branch formation with high spatial and temporal specificity . The elaborate regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex is critical for cells to restrict the formation of branched actin filaments to local parts of cells . This fine tuning of actin assembly allows motile cells to navigate precisely and take up distinct parts of the plasma membrane during endocytosis . 1 .
