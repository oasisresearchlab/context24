Actin polymerization , the main driving force for cell locomotion , is also used by the bacteria Listeria and Shigella and vaccinia virus for intracellular and intercellular movements 1 , 2 . Seminal studies have shown the key function of the Arp2 / 3 complex in nucleating actin and generating a branched array of actin ﬁla - ments during membrane extension and pathogen movement 3 . Arp2 / 3 requires activation by proteins such as the WASP - family proteins or ActA of Listeria . We previously reported that actin tails of Rickettsia conorii , another intracellular bacterium , unlike those of Listeria , Shigella or vaccinia , are made of long unbranched actin ﬁlaments apparently devoid of Arp2 / 3 ( ref . 4 ) . Here we identify a R . conorii surface protein , RickA , that activates Arp2 / 3 in vitro , although less efﬁciently than ActA . In infected cells , Arp2 / 3 is detected on the rickettsial surface but not in actin tails . When expressed in mammalian cells and targeted to the membrane , RickA induces ﬁlopodia . Thus RickA - induced actin polymerization , by generating long actin ﬁlaments reminiscent of those present in ﬁlopodia , has potential as a tool for studying ﬁlopodia formation . Converging studies on actin - based motility have led to the establishment of the essential role of Arp2 / 3 in this process 1 – 3 . Arp2 / 3 activates the nucleation of actin polymerization and induces the continuous formation of a network of short and highly branched ﬁlaments in lamellipodia and pathogen actin tails 1 – 3 . Arp2 / 3 is normally inactive and has to be activated by proteins of the WASP / N - WASP / Scar / Wave - family proteins in eukaryotic cells or the ActA protein at the surface of L . monocytogenes 1 , 3 – 8 . The Shigella protein VirG / IcsA and the vaccinia viral protein A36R are not directly involved in the activation of nucleation 2 . They recruit N - WASP and then Arp2 / 3 , respectively directly and indirectly . Other known activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex include yeast letters to nature NATURE | VOL 427 | 29 JANUARY 2004 | www . nature . com / nature 457 © 200 4 Nature PublishingGroup Bee1 / Las 17 ( ref . 9 ) and cortactin 10 , 11 . In spite of major advances in our understanding of lamellipodia formation and the movements of cells and pathogens , it is still unknown how long and unbranched actin ﬁlaments are generated during ﬁlopodia formation 12 . Here we address how another bacterial pathogen Rickettsia conorii poly - merizes actin . An earlier study had revealed that Rickettsia actin tails are different from Listeria or Shigella tails ; that is , they are much less dense and are made of long unbranched ﬁlaments , reminiscent of those present in ﬁlopodia 4 . We report that R . conorii expresses on its surface a previously unknown type of Arp2 / 3 activator that might prove useful in studying ﬁlopodia formation . Members of the genus Rickettsia are obligate intracellular bacteria that grow in the cytoplasm of their eukaryotic host 13 . They are responsible for several serious human diseases including epidemic typhus ( Rickettsia prowazekii ) and spotted fevers ( Rickettsia conorii , Rickettsia montana and Rickettsia rickettsii ) and are transmitted by arthropod vectors such as ticks and ﬂeas . Bacteria of the spotted fever group , in contrast to most of the typhus group , have the capacity to move intracellularly and intercellularly , as do Listeria and Shigella 4 , 14 . However , in contrast to these organisms , Rickettsia are not genetically manipulatable , and genetic approaches such as those used to discover the genes responsible for the actin - based motility in Listeria and Shigella are not possible . The genome sequences of R . prowazekii and R . conorii were determined recently 15 , 16 . Through genome comparison , we identiﬁed a 2 - kilo - base region that is present in the R . conorii genome and is absent from that of R . prowazekii . It encodes a 517 - amino - acid protein , RickA , that can be arbitrarily divided into three parts : a central proline - rich region ( amino acids 311 – 376 ) consisting of repeats that are different from the ActA repeats ( D / E ) FPPPPX ( D / E ) ( D / E ) Figure 1 The RickA protein of R . conorii activates Arp2 / 3 . a , Schematic representation of RickAandalignmentofthe G , CandA regionsofRickA , ActA , N - WASP , WASPandScar1 . b , Vero cells infected with R . conorii and labelled with anti - b - actin ( clone AC - 15 ; Sigma ) and anti - RickA antibodies ( R80 ) . c , Western blot analysis of RickA using R80 : lane 1 , puriﬁed RickA ; lane 2 , extracts from non - infected cells ; lane 3 , R . conorii extracts . d , Pyrenyl - actin polymerization assays : Arp2 / 3 ( 30nM alone , blue ) , RickA ( 70nM alone , pink ) or Arp2 / 3 ( 30nM ) in the presence of RickA ( 70 and 420nM , green ) , N - WASP - WA ( 70nM , purple ) or N - ActA ( 70nM , red ) . e , Branching assays were performed as described 19 with 60nM Arp2 / 3 and 2 m M actin , plus 70nM N - ActA or 420nM RickA .

Maximal branching was obtained at 60s for ActA and at 900s for RickA . letters to nature NATURE | VOL 427 | 29 JANUARY 2004 | www . nature . com / nature 458 © 200 4 Nature PublishingGroup known to allow binding of the Ena / VASP proteins , surrounded by an amino - terminal domain with a potential G - actin - binding site , similar to that of thymosin b 4 ( ref . 17 ) , and a carboxy - terminal region that shares similarities with the CA domains of WASP - family proteins ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , including the con - served hydrophobic domain and the positively charged region that would form the predicted amphipathic helix able to bind the Arp2 / 3 complex 18 . The amino - acid sequence of RickA does not display any signal sequence or a C - terminal motif that could act as a membrane anchor . Interestingly , the RickA paralogues in R . montana , R . rickettsii and R . siberica have the same general organization as RickA but with some variation in the number and the amino acid sequences of the proline - rich repeats ( data not shown ) . To study the function of the protein , we produced , although with very low yields , a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli and also raised antibodies against a peptide present in the N - terminal region of RickA . As shown by immunoﬂuorescence ( Fig . 1b ) , the RickA protein is highly expressed on the surface of all Rickettsiae , in infected cells . In addition , western blot analysis showed that the RickA protein , present in Rickettsia extracts and absent from extracts of non - infected cells , migrated as both a protein of 70 kDa ( as does the recombinant protein ) and a protein of 140 kDa , indicating that RickA can dimerize ( Fig . 1c ) . Actin polymerization assays in vitro with the N - terminal part of ActA ( N - ActA ) as a control showed that RickA alone was unable to stimulate actin polymerization but was able to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , in a dose - dependent manner and as efﬁciently as ActA ( Fig . 1d ) . However , in contrast to ActA , RickAdid not reduce the lag period preceding the exponential phase of actin nucleation . To investigate further the unexpected role of RickA in Arp2 / 3 activation we also used the technique 19 that analyses the capacity of activated Arp2 / 3 to induce branch formation in actin ﬁlaments . Again taking N - ActA as a control , we showed that in the presence of actin and Arp2 / 3 the RickA protein promotes ﬁlament branching ( Fig . 1e ) . However , a similar percentage of branching , at equivalent concentrations of Arp2 / 3 and actin , required sixfold more RickA than ActA and was reached after 15 min for RickA but after only 1 min for ActA ( Fig . 1e ) . Having shown that RickA is sufﬁcient to activate Arp2 / 3 , and thereby actin nucleation in vitro , it was of interest to clarify whether the Arp2 / 3 complex has a function in the formation of the Rickettsia actin tail and in the actin - based motility process in vivo , and also whether it is present in the tails . We therefore ﬁrst transfected cells with plasmids expressing either the C - terminal part of Scar ( WA ) —which can recruit and sequester Arp2 / 3 and acts as a dominant - negative fragment with respect to the function of the Arp2 / 3 complex—or a truncated version ( W ) , and infected these cells with Rickettsia ( Fig . 2 ) , using Listeria as a control ( data not shown ) 8 . Clearly , Rickettsia and Listeria actin tails were both detected in ScarW - transfected cells . In contrast , the number of bacteria ( Rickettsia or Listeria ) recruiting actin was greatly decreased in ScarWA - expressing cells , further indicating that the Arp2 / 3 complex might be used by Rickettsia , as it is in Listeria , to induce actin polymerization and movement . We next re - examined Arp2 / 3 recruitment in the tails . All previous attempts to detect the Arp2 / 3 complex in Rickettsia tails had failed 4 , 20 . Using a new batch of afﬁnity - puriﬁed antibodies , we were able to detect Arp3 around Rickettsia . Strikingly , Arp3 loca - lized with cytoplasmic bacteria , whether with or without actin tails ( Fig . 3 ) . However , for those without actin tails ( arrowheads in Fig . 3 , top panels ) , Arp3 was detected around the whole bacterial bodies , and the strong labelling indicates that it was probably abundantly recruited . In contrast , when bacteria were polymerizing actin ( arrows in Fig . 3 , upper panels ) , Arp3 was barely detectable at the base of the tail and was absent from the tail . This distribution of Arp3 is therefore different from that in Listeria tails ( arrowheads in Fig . 3 , lower panels ) , in which Arp3 localizes with actin and is present both at the base and all along the tail . These observations are in complete agreement with the in vitro data and strongly indicate that RickA can recruit and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex to induce actin polymerization in infected cells . If RickA recruits the Arp2 / 3 complex , it could behave as Figure 2 Transfection with ScarWA or the C - terminal part of RickA inhibits actin polymerization . Hep - 2 cells were infected with R . conorii 24h before transfection with the plasmids encoding ScarWA , ScarW or RickAC - ter ( the fragment containing residues 377 – 517 from RickA was cloned in pRK5Myc ( ref . 28 ) , resulting in plasmid pRC19 ( strain BUG1998 ) ) . The cells were processed for immunoﬂuorescence 24h after transfection with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate - conjugated phalloidin for F - actin , an anti - c - Myc monoclonal antibody for transfected cells and the polyclonal R47 antibody 4 for R . conorii . letters to nature NATURE | VOL 427 | 29 JANUARY 2004 | www . nature . com / nature 459 © 200 4 Nature PublishingGroup ScarWA when overexpressed in cells . To test this hypothesis we expressed the C - terminal part of RickA , which is similar to the VCA domain of N - WASP , in cells and infected them with Listeria or Rickettsia ( Fig . 2 ) . The results were similar to those obtained with ScarWA : transfection with the C - terminal part of RickA impaired Rickettsia tail formation . For Listeria , bacterial entry , which is known to be dependent on Arp2 / 3 , was even more strongly inhibited than with ScarWA . Collectively , both the in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that RickA is a previously unknown Arp2 / 3 activator . Because the known Arp2 / 3 activators have been involved in cell motility or the formation of plasma membrane protrusions , we were interested to analyse how RickAwould behave when expressed at the plasma membrane . We therefore transfected cells with a plasmid expressing a RickA - CAAX construct designed to drive expression of the protein at the inner face of the plasma membrane , as previously performed for ActA 21 . As shown in Fig . 4 , after RickA expression , Vero - transfected cells displayed thin ﬁlopodia that were absent from non - transfected cells . These ﬁlopodia , whose length varied with the cell line used for the transfection , were different from the lamellipodia - like structures obtained when ActA , or even more strikingly IcsA , was transfected in mammalian cells , reinforc - ing the hypothesis that RickA is a novel type of activator of actin nucleation . In conclusion , Rickettsia conorii cells express a surface protein , RickA , which recruits Arp2 / 3 , activates it and induces actin poly - merization . It is unknown how RickA is addressed to the bacterial surface and whether the type IV secretion system predicted by the genome sequence is involved in targeting to the surface . The actin ﬁlaments present behind intracellular bacteria in the tails are long and unbranched ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . These ﬁlaments might form bundles , in particular when bacteria spread from cell to cell , as shown previously 4 . Accordingly , as ﬁlopodia , Rickettsia tails contain the bundling protein fascin ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) 22 . How could such bundles form ? In agreement with the well - established ﬁndings that activated Arp2 / 3 initiates actin polymerization on previously formed actin ﬁlaments , generating a branch , it is possible that RickA initiates actin polymerization in such a way that actin ﬁlaments nucleated by Arp2 / 3 are then elongated at only one barbed end , just as in ﬁlopodia 12 . Could VASP have a function in this process ? VASP is present all along the Rickettsia tail 4 but is restricted to the base of the Listeria tails , where it binds directly to ActA through its EVH1 domain 23 . We infected D7 cells , which are completely devoid of Mena , VASPand EVL 24 , with Rickettsia or Listeria and compared the bacterial motility in these cells with that observed in D7 cells transfected with Mena . Rickettsia cells were less motile in the D7 cells , as were Listeria cells , suggesting that VASP - family proteins are required for maximal movement in Rickettsia . In both lamellipo - dia 25 and ActA - induced actin assembly 26 , VASP decreases branch density and , as proposed , could compete with capping proteins at the barbed ends 25 and thus increase ﬁlament length . This could also occur in RickA - induced actin assembly . In Shigella , Ena / VASP proteins are located throughout the tails , but reconstitution experi - ments suggest that Ena / Vasp proteins are dispensable for Shigella motility 7 . The role of VASP in Rickettsia motility therefore seems different from that in Listeria and Shigella motilities . Taken together , the Rickettsia protein RickA is a previously unknown bacterial activator of actin nucleation that requires Arp2 / 3 to initiate an actin polymerization process similar to that leading to ﬁlopodia 12 . Whether proteins thought to contribute to ﬁlopodia formation and / or predicted to be present at the tip of the ﬁlopodia are also involved in Rickettsia movement is unknown . It is possible that post - translational modiﬁcations of RickA such as phosphorylations at various positions including Ser 459 , a position corresponding to Ser 484 in WASP 27 , controls its activity . Whether another Rickettsia protein also participates in the actin - based motility has to be addressed . Thus , RickA is a bacterial actin nucleator that is most closely related to WASP / N - WASP - family Figure 3 Arp3 localizes with the bacteria R . conorii and with L . monocytogenes comet tails in Hep - 2 - infected cells . Upper panels , Hep - 2 cells infected with R . conorii ; lower panels , Hep - 2 cells infected with L . monocytogenes .

It is unknown whether RickA is of eukaryotic origin or has been transferred from Rickettsia to eukaryotic cells . A Methods Expression and puriﬁcation of recombinant proteins RickA , theActA - Nfragment ( residues1 – 233 ) andtheWAfragmentofN - WASP ( residues 392 – 505 ) were obtained as His - tagged proteins . The rickA gene was ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction with Rickettsia conorii ( Malish strain ) chromosomal DNA as template and the primers 5 0 - CCatggttaaagaaatagatataaataaa - 3 0 and 5 0 - caagctttctaacaaatgatgggttttg - 3 0 . This fragment was digested with Nco I and Hin dIII and cloned into these sites in pET28b . The DNA fragment encoding the WA fragment of N - WASPwasclonedintothe Eco RIand Xho IsitesofpET28atogenerateanN - terminalHis 6 - tagged protein . Proteins were expressed in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) and afﬁnity puriﬁed with Talon resin ( Clontech ) . Actin polymerization assays Polymerization assays were performed with the change in pyrenyl - actin ﬂuorescence . Pyrene - labelled rabbit muscle actin ( 10 % pyrene - labelled ) in G buffer ( 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2mM DTT , 0 . 2mM ATP , 1mM MgCl 2 , 5mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 ) was precleared at 250 , 000 g for 30min . MgATP - actin ( 1 . 5 m M , 10 % pyrene - labelled ) was polymerized in 1 £ KMET ( 50mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , 10mM Tris - HCl pH 7 ) supplemented with 0 . 5mM ATP and RickA ( 70nM ) or Arp2 / 3 ( 30nM ) alone or in the presence of N - WASP - WA ( 70nM ) , N - ActA ( 70nM ) and RickA ( 70 and 420nM ) . Measurements were made with a Varian Eclipse Spectroﬂuorometer at 25 8 C , with excitation and emission wavelengths of 350 and 390nm respectively . Membrane targeting of RickA - CAAX , ActA - CAAX and IcsA - CAAX To express RickA at the plasma membrane , an approach similar to that used in ref . 21 was taken with plasmid pRK5Myc ( ref . 28 ) , which allows the expression of N - terminal Myc - tagged and C - terminal CAAX - tagged protein . DNA fragments encoding ActA ( 1 – 580 ) , RickA ( 1 – 517 ) and IcsA ( 53 – 758 ) were cloned in the Bam HI and Eco RI sites of pRK5Myc - CAAX . The resultant plasmids were transiently expressed in Vero cells with Lipofectamine 2000 . Antibodies Anti - RickA antibodies ( R80 ) were generated by immunizing rabbits against the peptide CQNETKELEKEHNRSandafﬁnitypuriﬁed . Anti - Rickettsia mousepolyclonalantibodies ( S1 ) were obtained by immunizing BALBc mice with formalin - killed bacteria puriﬁed from infected yolk sac .

A sudden increase in permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane , the so - called mitochondrial permeability transition , is a common feature of apoptosis and is mediated by the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ( mtPTP ) . It is thought that the mtPTP is a protein complex formed by the voltage - dependent anion channel , members of the pro - and anti - apoptotic BAX - BCL2 protein family , cyclophilin D , and the adenine nucleotide ( ADP / ATP ) translocators ( ANTs ) 1 , 2 . The lat - ter exchange mitochondrial ATP for cytosolic ADPand have been implicated in cell death . To investigate the role of the ANTs in the mtPTP , we genetically inactivated the two isoforms of ANT 3 – 5 in mouse liver and analysed mtPTP activation in isolated mito - chondria and the induction of cell death in hepatocytes .
