Exploiting 15 the unique patterns found in the residues of a naturally dried droplet of blood , we propose a 16 Point - of - Care ( POC ) diagnostic tool for detecting broad - spectrum of bacterial infections 17 ( such as Enterobacter aerogenes , Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , 18 Acinetobacter baumannii , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Salmonella Typhi ) in blood . The 19 diagnosis process we propose is straightforward and can be performed with the following 20 steps : A droplet of blood ( healthy or infected ) of volume range 0 . 5 to 2 μl is allowed to dry 21 on a clean glass surface and is imaged using a conventional optical microscope . A computer 22 algorithm based on the framework of convolution neural network ( CNN ) is used to classify 23 the captured images of dried blood droplets according to the bacterial infection . In total , our 24 multiclass model reports an accuracy of 92 % for detecting six bacterial species infections in 25 the blood ( with control being the uninfected or healthy blood ) . The high accuracy of 26 detecting bacteria in the blood reported in this article is commensurate with the standard 27 bacteriological tests . Thus , this article presents a proof - of - concept of a potential futuristic tool 28 for a rapid and low - cost diagnosis of bacterial infection in the blood . 29 INTRODUCTION : 30 Antimicrobial resistance ( AMR ) has become a cause of global concern , aggravated by a 31 lack of data on the different mechanisms and factors causing its emergence and spread . 32 According to a WHO report , bacterial infections alone cause nearly 1 million deaths per year 33 worldwide ; this number is estimated to increase to 10 million per year by 2050 , owing to 34 AMR 1 . Entero - pathogens ( such as Salmonella Typhi ) and ESKAPE ( Enterococcus faecium , 35 Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Acinetobacter baumannii , Pseudomonas 36 aeruginosa , and Enterobacter aerogenes ) pathogens are the deadliest , and every passing 37 year they cause millions of infections and thousands of deaths worldwide 2 – 6 . These bacteria 38 are clinically relevant strains causing ~ 42 % bloodstream infection and have been associated 39 with significant mortality and morbidity 7 , 8 . The WHO report lists these pathogens as priority 40 antibiotic - resistant pathogens as they are associated with a significant amount of mortality 41 and morbidity due to the emergence of multiple drug resistance ( MDR ) and extensive drug 42 resistance ( XDR ) strain 6 . Even developed economies like the United States 9 and other 43 European countries 10 are finding it difficult to cope with the increasing AMR ; an estimated 44 cost of billions of dollars is attributed to the health care expenditure of hospital - acquired and 45 community - acquired AMR infections 9 . The first step to stop the spreading of infection would 46 .

Timely diagnosis of the causative organism and subsequent treatment of 47 bacterial infection can save millions of lives and inhibit the generation of various drug - 48 resistant strains . “Test , isolate ( the person infected ) , and treat” is the primary formula used by 49 advanced countries to stop the spread of infection , as evidenced during the Global COVID - 19 50 pandemic 11 . Thus , it is crucial to test rapidly to prevent the further spread of infection and any 51 possible outbreak . 52 Since the abovementioned bacterial strains ( Enteropathogens and ESKAPE pathogens ) 53 majorly cause bloodstream infections 12 , 13 and can mainspring changes in the composition and 54 fluid properties of the blood , it is prudent to test blood for diagnosis of these infections . 55 Moreover , blood profile indicates the overall health of the individuals ; thus , it is a general 56 practice to test blood for several abnormalities , including bacterial infections . 57 Conventionally , various tests and investigations are undertaken to diagnose diseases in 58 blood—such as a complete blood count , chemistry profiling of urea and electrolytes , level of 59 C - Reactive Protein ( CRP ) , glucose , and coagulation screen , to name a few . Several 60 biomarkers have been reported in the literature to diagnose sepsis 14 , such as pro - 61 inflammatory and anti - inflammatory cytokines and chemokines , altered cell surface marker 62 of immune cells . One of the main drawbacks of these markers is that they have low 63 specificity and high cost associated with high - end technique requirements for the detection 15 . 64 The gold standard for bacterial infection diagnosis is bacteriological culture and staining 16 . 65 Infectious agents are isolated and identified using various selective and differential culture 66 media . However , bacteriological culture diagnosis of the infection is often time - consuming 67 ( require up to 48 hours ) . Alternatively , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) based diagnostics 68 are faster than standard bacteriological culture - based methods . Nonetheless , due to high 69 sensitivity , it often can give false - positive results . Another major disadvantage for PCR - based 70 detection involves too high cost and specialized instrumentation and setup requirement , 71 which may not be feasible in semi - urban or rural areas 17 – 20 . Therefore , there is an urgent need 72 for innovative solutions to create accurate , low - cost , rapid diagnostic tools to detect bacterial 73 infections in the blood . This article addresses the above problems by providing a simple 74 method to rapidly detect a broad spectrum of bacterial infections in the blood ( with a 75 turnaround time of less than 15 minutes ) by leveraging the unique patterns formed on the 76 residue of the dried blood droplets . 77 With the advent of fundamental research on droplet evaporation and colloidal self - 78 assembly in droplets in the past few decades , the dried precipitates of biological fluids have 79 been deeply studied 21 – 30 . A few of these studies have found applications in biomedical 80 diagnostics 31 – 34 . The competitive interaction of multi - component elements in biological fluid 81 like blood leads to the formation of rich patterns on the dried droplet precipitate 35 such as 82 distinctive radial , spiral , and tangential cracks , color variations , varying thickness of the 83 coffee rings , finger formations , etc . ( Refer to image S1 in the supplementary information for 84 the image of a dried droplet of blood taken from a healthy volunteer ) . These features depend 85 on the properties of the fluid ( and thereby the components present in it ) , which in turn can be 86 related to the health of a person . Notably , in blood droplets , it has been shown previously that 87 the flow inside the droplet is driven by Marangoni , wettability , and natural evaporation leads 88 to the formation of distinctive patterns on the dried residues of the drop for anemic and 89 hyperlipidemic blood samples 36 – 38 . Besides , the final dried blood droplet pattern is 90 susceptible to drying conditions such as temperature 39 and humidity 40 , placement of blood 91 droplet 41 ( gentle or with impact ) , and depends on several other factors such as blood groups 42 , 92 ethnicity 43 , age 44 , gender 43 , size , shape , and mobility of cells 45 . Further , blood infection leads 93 to cellular changes such as Leucocytosis 63 or leukopenia , and biochemical changes include 94 markers released upon red blood cell lysis or white blood cell lysis 63 . Thus , the blood 95 .

Thus , the human 100 interpretation of optical images of dried blood droplets for disease diagnosis can be prone to 101 errors ; it is inevitable to use computer - assisted diagnosis . Also , the use of computers for the 102 diagnosis will lead to a rapid and more accurate diagnosis . Bio - Medical diagnostics have 103 extensively used Deep learning ( DL ) and Convolutional Neural networks ( CNN ) . For 104 example , with the help of images generated by CT scans , breast cancer , lung nodule , and 105 segmentation can be detected using CNN and DL 19 - 27 . These computer models reported 63 - 106 85 % accuracy ( AlexNet 63 . 98 % 28 , DenseNet 80 . 7 % 29 , and Wang et al . 85 % 30 ) , but the 107 training data set had very few runs ( less than five runs ) . Recently , Machine Learning ( ML ) 108 analysis was used to discriminate dried blood droplet patterns with varying physiological 109 conditions , i . e . , changes in dried blood droplet patterns before or after physical exercise of the 110 volunteers were detected using ML with a 95 % prediction accuracy 48 . This demonstrates that 111 ML is a potent tool to classify patterns formed by blood droplets with even slight changes in 112 blood chemistry induced by the physical exercise of volunteers . However , it remains unclear 113 if the ML or DL can detect a wide variety of bacterial pathogens in the blood . 114 The current article presents a proof - of - concept of an alternative low - cost and rapid point - of - 115 care diagnostic tool by imaging a dried droplet of blood using simple optical microscopy . It 116 has been demonstrated that a wide range of deadly pathogens such as ( Enterobacter 117 aerogenes , Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Acinetobacter baumannii , and 118 Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Salmonella Typhi ) present in the blood can be detected using the 119 framework of CNN . The diagnostic procedure is described as follows : An image of a dried 120 blood droplet ( that may contain the target infection ) on a glass substrate is captured using an 121 optical microscope . The captured image is fed into an in - house developed computer 122 algorithm that predicts the possible infection based on CNN architecture . Our model reports 123 an accuracy of 92 % for distinguishing the infection of the abovementioned bacterial species 124 in the blood . The computer algorithm for this application is developed by training and testing 125 the algorithm in a supervised learning environment with a large number of images of blood 126 droplets ( ~ 35 , 000 images ) , whose status of infection is known apriori . The model accuracy 127 remains invariant over the large dataset . 128 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION : 129 Blood collection from the volunteers is detailed in the experimental procedure section . 130 The blood is spiked with bacteria in - vitro ( individual bacterial species are spiked in different 131 vials of blood ( Fig . 1 ( a ) and ( b ) ) - Enterobacter aerogenes ( EA ) , Staphylococcus aureus 132 ( SA ) , Klebsiella pneumoniae ( KP ) , Acinetobacter baumannii ( AB ) , Pseudomonas aeruginosa 133 ( PA ) ) , Salmonella Typhi ( ST ) ) . The unspiked blood sample is used as a control ( C ) against 134 the abovementioned spiked samples , i . e . , it does not contain any bacteria and is considered a 135 healthy blood sample . These samples are incubated for 24h at 37 o C . Each blood sample in 136 the vials ( including the control ) is considered an individual class and labeled accordingly ( see 137 Fig . 1 ( b ) ) . Several hundred droplets ( of volume 0 . 5 to 2 μl ) of blood samples 138 ( spiked / unspiked ) are deposited on a clean glass slide on a given day and allowed to 139 evaporate in the controlled atmospheric condition ( 26 ±5 o C and 45 ±10 % RH ) ( Fig . 1 ( c ) and 140 .

The droplets are imaged using a conventional optical microscope—a total of 35000 141 images are acquired ( number of images in each class ( ~ 5000 images of each class ) . Sample 142 images of the dried blood droplet of the glass slide spiked with different bacteria , and the 143 control ( unspiked ) is shown in Fig . 1 ( e ) . The blood droplet evaporates in constant contact 144 radius ( CCR ) mode as the droplet remains pinned throughout evaporation ( irrespective of any 145 class ) . The droplets generally assume the shape of a spherical cap as the Bond number ( Bo ) is 146 < < 1 and the dried residue is of a circular shape . However , few droplets show a shape 147 disparity due to errors in dispensing the drop from the micropipette . Thus , amongst the nearly 148 47 , 000 images taken , about 13 , 000 images are discarded to disregard the shape disparity of 149 the droplet . The analysis in this article is based on 34469 images considered after filtration . It 150 is evident from Fig . 1 ( e ) that it is difficult to classify the blood droplet residues according to 151 the bacteria present in them from a visual inspection of the images . Hence , we have 152 developed an image classification computer algorithm using CNN to recognize different 153 classes . 154 155 Figure 1 . Evaporation triggered pattern formation in infected and healthy blood 156 droplets . ( a ) 15 ml of blood is collected from a healthy volunteer in vacutainer tubes . ( b ) 157 the collected blood is infected with bacteria ( in - vitro ) and is labeled as follows : 158 Enterobacter aerogenes - EA , Staphylococcus aureus - SA , Klebsiella pneumoniae - KP , 159 Acinetobacter baumannii - AB , Pseudomonas aeruginosa - PA , Salmonella Typhi - ST . 160 The blood sample that does not contain any infection is considered as a control and is 161 labeled as - C . All the samples are incubated for 24h at 37 o C . The individual labels are 162 referred to as “class” . ( c ) A few hundreds of droplets of 0 . 5 - 2 μl of a known sample ( as 163 labeled in ( b ) ) are gently placed on clean glass slides using a micro - pipette . The 164 .

( d ) The deposited droplets are allowed to evaporate in an 166 enclosed chamber . The evaporation profile is shown in the zoomed - in image of the 167 droplet , with the evaporation flux being maximum at the edge and minimum at the 168 center of the drop . ( e ) Sample images of dried blood droplets labeled according to their 169 class ( the respective label is on top of the image ) . The label at the top of the image 170 indicates the species of bacterial infection in the blood . The last image in the row is not 171 infected with bacteria and thus is the control . 172 The algorithm is developed in Python programming language and uses seven libraries to 173 analyze the data set : NumPy 49 , Keras 50 , Matplotlib 51 , Seaborn 52 , Scikit 53 , Tensorflow 54 , and 174 OpenCV 55 ( Refer to Fig . 2 ( a ) , Matplotlib , Seaborn are for plotting the data ) . The data set 175 ( captured images of blood droplets ) is imported and labeled according to the given class . 176 Prior to analysis , the image data set is segregated in the ratio of 80 : 20 for training and testing , 177 respectively ( see Fig . 2 ( b ) ) . This segregation is done randomly to avoid any bias . The images 178 are further pre - processed using a series of operations using the ImageDataGenerator function 179 in the Keras library to maintain uniformity for variables like contrast , color , and positioning 180 of the drop in the image . The processed images are discretized and equalized into an array of 181 numbers ( vector ) . However , analyzing this data on traditional computing infrastructure ( the 182 hardware used is Intel ( R ) Core i7 2 . 90 GHz 64 GB RAM ) is a challenge as the volume of 183 data generated by the images is very large . 184 185 Figure 2 . The overall design of the CNN algorithm used to train the computer to classify 186 images of the residues of dried blood droplets according to their classes . ( a ) The 187 algorithm imports standard libraries used for CNN . Importantly , NumPy 49 , Keras 50 , 188 Tensorflow 54 , OpenCV 55 , and Seaborn 52 are imported libraries , to name a few . ( b ) The 189 imported image data set consisting of ~ 35000 images are labeled as per their respective 190 .

The image dataset is divided into the training and testing sets in the ratio 80 : 20 , 191 respectively . The model is trained using the training data set and is validated using the 192 test dataset . The test dataset is not used during training , thus ensuring no data leakage 193 from the test dataset . ( c ) The image data set is converted to a number array ( vector ) and 194 analyzed using multiple layers . Model parameters such as epochs , kernel size for 195 convolutional layers , image size , and learning rate are fed into the model , and the model 196 is trained using the training set . The model makes a prediction using the testing dataset . 197 Iterations are repeated with a new set of values for model parameters until the highest 198 possible accuracy is achieved . 199 Hence the algorithm is developed in a two - step process . First , the model is optimized 200 for binary classes , i . e . , the algorithm is trained to distinguish between any two classes with 201 high accuracy . Since there are seven classes , the model for 7 C 2 binary classes is optimized 202 ( see Fig . 3 ) . Second , the parameters used for optimizing the binary classes ( such as epochs - 203 the number of times the algorithm iterates the whole dataset for training , kernel size for 204 convolutional layers 51 , image size , and learning rate - the variation in the model with updated 205 weights ) are used in the multiclass model with all the classes included , as shown in Fig . 3 ( 7 206 classes including the control case ) . While the basic structure of the algorithm remains the 207 same , the parameters optimized for binary classes are used as a template for the multiclass 208 model with all the classes . 209 To examine the algorithm for its ability to distinguish between the binary classes , the 210 vector output of the processed images from any two classes is input into the CNN Model . The 211 CNN model consists of the following layers : convolution layer 51 , pooling layer 56 , dropout 212 layer 52 , flattening layer 53 , and fully connected layer 54 ( Refer to Figure 2 ( c ) ) . The modeling 213 parameters such as filters used and kernel size in the convolution layer , the prevention of 214 overfitting the data in the dropout layer , and units in the dense layer 50 have a crucial role in 215 improving the overall accuracy of detection . The values of epochs , learning rate , kernel and 216 image size for which the highest accuracy of prediction is achieved are considered optimized 217 values . Using the trial and error method , the optimization of the model ( for the given vector ) 218 is achieved by setting the values of epochs , learning rate , kernel size , and image size - 50 , 10 - 219 4 , 9×9 , and 256 pixels , respectively . The trained model is tested using the test image data set 220 ( 20 % of the segregated image data set for testing ) and the results of accuracy , precision , and 221 recall for 21 binary classes are given in table 1 . 222 .

The accuracy of the model is the ratio of correctly 230 .

The loss is the summation of errors made in prediction by the 231 model on the training and test image datasets ( see Fig . 5 ( b ) ) . The precision is the percentage 232 of actual positive samples to the predicted positive samples ( which may be correct or 233 incorrect ) . Recall ( sensitivity ) is the ratio of correctly predicted positive samples out of total 234 positive samples . As shown in Table 1 ( for binary classes ) , the accuracy , precision , and recall 235 range from 80 - 98 % to 85 - 98 % and 81 - 98 % , respectively . The model parameters used for the 236 binary classes are considered to be optimized as the accuracy achieved for binary classes is 237 maximum for the given image data set . The optimized parameters used by the model for 238 binary classes are introduced into the multiclass model containing all the classes . The 239 algorithm is iterated for the multiclass model with the optimized parameters . 240 241 Table 2 : Accuracy , precision , and recall values of a multiclass model consisting of 7 242 classes 243 Class Accuracy Precision Recall EA 0 . 92 0 . 97 0 . 96 SA 0 . 94 0 . 99 KP 0 . 96 0 . 9 AB 0 . 91 0 . 88 PA 0 . 91 0 . 91 ST 0 . 95 0 . 99 C 0 . 81 0 . 98 Since the model is trained with the training image dataset , it ( the training image 244 dataset ) should fit the model accurately upon validation . Fig . 4 ( a ) shows that this model has 245 97 % accuracy when validated with the training image dataset . Subsequently , if the training 246 image dataset of only one of the classes fed to the algorithm is correct , the accuracy of the 247 model is stunted to 1 / 7 ( refer to Fig . 4 ( b ) ) . Thus , the model predicts appropriately for the 248 trained image dataset . The test image data set is unknown to the trained model . Thus , the 249 model is validated using the test image data set to mimic a real - life scenario . Upon validation , 250 the precision and recall values range from 88 to 99 % and 81 to 97 % , respectively , for 251 different classes ( see table 2 ) . The overall accuracy of the multiclass model achieved is 92 % 252 ( see table 2 ) . The overall accuracy of the model is calculated by averaging the values of 253 precision of the individual classes through their equal shared weights . The loss curve in Fig . 254 5 ( b ) signifies the reduction of signal noises as the training proceeds . 255 .

Plots of ( a ) Accuracy curve and ( b ) loss curve of the multiclass model 263 The precision of the multiclass model varies widely and can be classified based on its range . 264 ( 1 ) The precision of class C is low < 90 % . ( 2 ) The precision of classes AB , PA , SA , and ST is 265 between 90 % to ≤95 % . ( 3 ) EA and KP have precision > 95 % . The values of precision 266 obtained in binary classes have a similar range for the given bacteria . For , e . g . , binary classes 267 of - EA and KP , PA and SA , and SA and ST have has 98 % , 96 % , and 98 % precision , 268 respectively . Therefore , it can be concluded that accuracy values are dependent on the 269 individual bacteria and the extent of change they cause in the blood properties by their 270 presence . Our investigation found that Enterococcus faecium ( EF ) ( one of the ESKAPE 271 pathogens ) did not cause sufficient change in the blood properties , and the algorithm failed to 272 distinguish the blood droplet residues that were infected with EF . Hence , the bacterial species 273 EF has not been considered for investigation in the article . 274 .

The 276 detection process is cost - efficient as it does not require any biomarkers / chemicals or high - end 277 equipment . Since the detection procedure involves only capturing an optical image , this can 278 be performed by a non - professional with minimal expertise in the healthcare sector . The 279 trained algorithm developed into a mobile application with a user interface has the potential 280 to revolutionize POC diagnostics . Moreover , the promising results with high accuracy 281 obtained in this article are equivalent to the accuracy of standard bacteriological tests 57 – 59 . 282 Besides , the technique has added benefits such as rapid turnaround time ( less than 15 283 minutes ) , low cost , and is suitable for POC . 284 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE : 285 All bacterial cultures , namely , Enterobacter aerogenes , Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella 286 pneumoniae , Acinetobacter baumannii , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Salmonella Typhi , 287 were grown in Luria Bertani medium . Briefly , a single colony of bacterial culture from a 288 freshly streaked LB agar plate was inoculated in LB broth overnight at 37℃ at 170 rpm 289 shaker incubator . Next , the bacteria are normalized with OD 600nm . The blood was collected in 290 a lavender vacutainer ( K3 - EDTA , Quantum Biomedicals ) from five healthy volunteers , age 291 24 - 30 years , with diverse blood groups ( O + ve , O - ve , AB + ve , B + ve , B - ve ) , and it was 292 stored at 4℃ and used for experiments up to a week . These storage conditions do not 293 influence the blood properties ( for a week ) , and thus the drying process is unaffected due to 294 storge 36 . Bloodstream infection diagnosis ranges from 1 - 10 CFU / mL 60 , 61 to 10 3 - 10 4 295 CFU / mL 62 ; blood collected from the donor was thus spiked with bacterial culture to a final 296 concentration of 10 3 CFU / mL to mimic tangible infection in real - life patients , and un - spiked 297 blood is used as a control ( C ) . Since equal volumes of phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS - 137 298 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 8 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 ) is added to normalize all the 299 bacterial numbers to a constant of 1000 CFU / mL , an equal volume of PBS without any 300 bacteria was added as a control . To observe bacterial - induced changes in the blood ( as per the 301 model of bloodstream infection ) , we incubated the blood at static conditions 37℃ for 24 302 hours 64 before drop - casting it . Subsequently , the control sample ( C ) is also placed in the same 303 static conditions for 24 hours before drop - casting the same . 304 Experimental setup for droplet evaporation and imaging : 305 Optically flat plain glass slides procured from Blue Star© are cleaned using the following 306 procedure : the glass slides are immersed in an ultrasound bath sonicator ( from Rivotek TM ) 307 containing isopropyl alcohol ( commonly known as isopropanol ) and are sonicated for 15 308 minutes . This is followed by a de - ionized ( DI ) water rinse and blow - dry . The average surface 309 roughness ( R a ) is ~ 40 nm ( measured using the optical profilometer tool by The TalySurf CCI 310 ) . As shown in Figures 1 ( b ) and ( c ) , the incubated samples from the vials are drop cast gently 311 onto the clean glass slides using a micropipette ( Finnpipette® ) . The volume of the droplets 312 ranges from 0 . 5 to 2 μl . Hundreds of droplets are placed on the glass slide in linear 313 arrangements separated at least by the distance of 2 times the droplet diameter ( L C ) , ensuring 314 no vapor - mediated interactions between the individual droplets 65 ( refer to Fig . 1 ( c ) ) . The 315 glass slides are labeled as the sample deposited on a particular slide is known . The droplets 316 are allowed to evaporate under controlled atmospheric conditions ( 26 ±5 o C and 45 ±10 % 317 relative humidity measured by TSP - 01 , Thorlabs ) in an acrylic enclosure to minimize the 318 .

All experiments are conducted inside a bio - safety hood 319 with HEPA filters following the biosafety laboratory - II protocols . The bacterial samples and 320 other plastic wares were discarded with 10 % bleach , followed by double autoclaving all the 321 waste . 322 The blood drops generally evaporate in 10 - 12 minutes ; they are imaged using an optical 323 microscope ( Olympus microscope ) . The droplet is illuminated by an LED light source in - line 324 with the objective lens of the microscope—a digital camera ( Nikon D7200 ) attached to the 325 microscope captures the reflected light and images of the droplet . The captured images were 326 manually filtered for uniformity and shape ( as the Bo < < 1 , the droplet assumes a spherical 327 shape ) . The background of the images ( other than the droplet region ) is removed to reduce 328 the redundant information . The captured images constitute the image data set to be processed 329 through the CNN algorithm . 330 331 Credit statement 332 Conceptualization : SB , DC ; Methodology : OH , RC , DR ; Investigation : OH , RC , VJ , 333 Visualization : OH , RC , DR , VJ ; Funding acquisition : SB , DC ; Project administration : OH , 334 VJ ; Supervision : SB , DC ; Writing original draft : OH ; Editing and revision : OH , RC , VJ , DC , 335 SB . 336 Acknowledgments 337 The authors acknowledge Suraksha Sunil , Amey Agharkar , Ankur Chattopadhyay , Srinivas 338 Rao S , Rovin Pinto , and Gannena K .
