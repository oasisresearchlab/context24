Davies , Salman Tamaddon - Jahromi , Riaz Jannoo , Venkateswarlu Kanamarlapudi * Institute of Life Science 1 , College of Medicine , Swansea University , Singleton Park , Swansea SA2 8PP , UK 1 . Introduction Cell migration is an important and tightly co - ordinated process for development and maintenance of tissue structures [ 1 ] . The movement of cells is controlled by spatial and temporal changes in cell membrane shape , which is driven by actin cytoskeleton [ 1 ] . The actin cytoskeleton causes morphological changes ( such as ﬁlopodia , lamellipodia and actin stress ﬁbres formation ) at the plasma membrane , which are regulated by various small GTPases including ADP - ribosylation factors ( ARFs ) [ 1 , 2 ] . Preadipocyte migration is an important stage in the process of adipocyte tissue formation [ 3 ] . Adipocyte tissue formation is initiated with the proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) , which then differentiate into immature adipocytes [ 3 ] . The preadipocytes migrate to different sites before undergoing further differentiation to form mature adipocytes , which become spherical in shape and contain lipids droplets [ 3 ] . Chronic over - nutrition of adipose tissue Biochemical Pharmacology 92 ( 2014 ) 651 – 660 A R T I C L E I N F O Article history : Received 19 August 2014 Accepted 30 September 2014 Available online 20 October 2014 Chemical compounds studied in this article : Dynasore PD98059 BFA SecinH3 LY294002 QS11 PBP10 Keywords : Preadipocytes migration ARF6 Cytohesin 2 ERK Dynamin A B S T R A C T Preadipocyte migration is vital for the development of adipose tissue , which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism . ADP - ribosylation factor 6 ( ARF6 ) small GTPase , which regulates membrane trafﬁcking , is activated by GTP - exchange factors ( GEFs ) such as cytohesin 2 . Cytohesin 2 and ARF6 have previously been implicated in the regulation of 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte migration . We investigated here the molecular mechanism underlying the cytohesin 2 and ARF6 mediated regulation of preadipocyte migration . Preadipocyte migration and the activation of ARF6 and ERK1 / 2 were studied by using a number of approaches , including pharmacological inhibitors , siRNA and the inhibitory peptides . The siRNA mediated down regulation of ARF6 and cytohesin 2 expression conﬁrmed the requirement of both for migration of preadipocytes . Phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) and PI 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) have also found to be essential for the cytohesin 2 / ARF6 induced preadipocyte migration . Pharmacological inhibition of the activation of ARF6 , ERK1 / 2 or dynamin led to signiﬁcant reduction in migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes . Furthermore , our study revealed the activation of ARF6 and ERK1 / 2 during migration of preadipocytes . In the migrating preadipocytes , ARF6 activation was inhibited with SecinH3 ( cytohesin inhibitor ) and LY294002 ( PI3K inhibitor ) whereas the ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation was inhibited with SecinH3 , LY294002 , PBP10 ( a PIP 2 sequester peptide ) and PD98059 ( MAPKK inhibitor ) . However , dynosore ( dynamin inhibitor ) had inhibited neither ARF6 activation nor ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation during preadipocyte migration . These results together suggest that cytohesin 2 activates ARF6 in a PI3K dependent manner and then the active ARF6 causes phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 during preadipocyte migration .

They cycle between the active GTP bound and inactive GDP bound conformations [ 5 ] . ARFs are regulated through activation by guanine nucleotide - exchange factors ( GEFs ) and inactivation by GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) [ 5 ] . There are six mammalian ARF proteins ( ARFs 1 – 6 ) , ARF1 and ARF6 are the best characterised and least related . ARF1 localises to and acts at the Golgi whereas ARF6 localises to and acts at the cell periphery [ 6 ] . ARF6 plays a pivotal role in cell migration by regulating actin cytoskeletal remodelling and membrane trafﬁcking at the plasma membrane [ 1 ] . All ARFs , except ARF6 , activation is inhibited by Brefeldin A ( BFA ) , a fungal metabolite , whereas ARF6 activation by cytohesins is inhibited by a chemical inhibitor SecinH3 [ 7 ] . However , QS11 , which is a cell permeable purine derivative , increases the activation of ARFs by inhibiting the ARF GAP activity [ 8 ] . There are four cytohesin family members in humans ( cytohesins 1 – 4 ) , each of which contain a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain that binds to PI 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) . Cytohesins 1 – 3 have been shown to translocate from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in a PI3K dependent manner , where they activate ARF6 [ 9 – 13 ] . Cell migration has previously been demonstrated to be regulated by ARF6 speciﬁc GEFs such as BRAGs ( 1 – 3 ) and exchange factor for ARF6 ( EFA6 ) [ 14 ] . The cytohesin family of ARF GEFs have also been demonstrated in a variety of cell types to be important regulators of cell migration [ 15 – 17 ] . Paxillin , a focal adhesion protein , has been found to interact with and regulate cytohesin 2 activity during the migration of preadipocytes [ 3 ] . ERK1 / 2 and Rac1 have previously been shown to function downstream of ARF6 in cell migration [ 16 ] . The ARF6 - dependent activation of ERK1 / 2 has been shown to be required for epithelial tubule development in Madin – Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells and human liver cancer cell migration stimulated by epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) [ 16 , 18 ] . Dynamin has also been linked with cell migration through its involvement in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton remodel - ling , focal adhesion disassembly , lamellipodial accumulation and accumulation of Rac1 at the leading edge of cell during the migration [ 19 ] . In addition , the interaction between dynamin and cortactin during cell migration has previously been shown to be potentiated by ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation [ 20 , 21 ] . In addition to their role in cell migration , both cytohesin 2 and ARF6 have been implicated in early stages of insulin signalling at the insulin receptor , where inhibition of signalling led to insulin resistance in cultured hepatocytes [ 7 , 22 ] . The close relationship of imbalanced lipid storage and insulin resistance suggests that cytohesin 2 and ARF6 could play a role in the pathological changes observed in type 2 diabetes . Consistent with this view , we have recently shown the involvement ARF6 in endothelin - 1 induced lipolysis in 3T3 - L1 adipocytes [ 23 ] . In this study , cytohesin 2 and ARF6 have been found to regulate 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte migration through their downstream signalling effectors ERK1 / 2 and dynamin . Furthermore , we have shown that cytohesin 2 activates ARF6 in a PI3K dependent manner and then the active ARF6 causes activation / phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 during the migration of preadipocytes . 2 .

Oris cell migration assay This assay was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions using Oris cell migration assay kit . Brieﬂy , 0 . 1 ml of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes ( 2 . 5 (cid:2) 10 5 cells / ml ) grown in DMEM con - taining 10 % CS , 2 mM glutamine , 100 U / ml penicillin and 0 . 1 mg / ml streptomycin ( FSM ) were seeded in each test well of Oris cell migration 96 - well plates and incubated the plates in a cell culture incubator for 2 h to permit cell adhesion . Cells seeded in pre - migration wells in a separate plate were washed three times with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PF ) for 15 min , washed again with PBS thrice and stored at 4 8 C . After adding test compounds directly to cells seeded wells , the plate was incubated for a further 24 h to allow cells to migrate . The wells were then washed with PBS , ﬁxed with 4 % PF and washed again with PBS as for the pre - migration plate . After ﬁxation , both pre - migration and post - migration wells were stained for nucleus using DAPI ( 1 mg / ml ; 1 : 4000 dil . ) in PBS for 10 min . The wells were washed with PBS twice for 5 min . Images of wells were captured using InCell Analyzer 2000 ( GE Healthcare ) and cell free area within detection zone was quantiﬁed using ImageJ software . Cell migration is presented as percentage closure of cell free zone area , calculated using the equation ( [ pre - migration ] area (cid:3) Oris [ post - migration ] area / [ pre - migration ] area ) (cid:2) 100 . 2 . 3 . Cell Comb Scratch Assay Cell scratches were carried out using Cell Comb Scratch Assay . 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes plated in rectangular 1 - well plates were grown in FSM to conﬂuence . After removing the medium , plates were scratched in one direction with the Cell Comb . Cells were then washed once with DMEM to remove detached cells , and incubated in 10 ml of FSM without or with inhibitors for indicated period . Cells were also incubated for 1 – 2 h with inhibitors , where indicated , prior to scratching . Images were captured immediately after scratching and at indicated time after scratching using a light microscope equipped with camera ( Canon , EOS 600D ) and cell scratch areas were quantiﬁed using ImageJ software . Cell migra - tion in this assay is presented as percentage closure of cell scratch area , calculated using the same equation that used for Oris cell migration assay . Cells were then lysed as described in the ARF6 - GTP pulldown assay and used to assess ARF6 activation and ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation . 2 . 4 . ARF6 - GTP pulldown assay This assay was carried out as described previously [ 24 ] . The GST - GGA3 protein binding domain ( PBD ) fusion protein was puriﬁed and coupled to glutathione - Sepharose beads ( GE Health - care ) . Preadipocytes were washed twice in ice - cold PBS and lysed at 4 8 C for 15 min with lysis buffer ( 500 m l per plate ; 25 mM Tris – HCl [ pH 7 . 2 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 % NP40 , 5 % glycerol ) containing 1 % mammalian protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma Aldrich , Poole , UK ) . The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14 , 000 (cid:2) g J . C . B . Davies et al . / Biochemical Pharmacology 92 ( 2014 ) 651 – 660 652 for 10 min at 4 8 C to pellet cellular debris . A 400 m l fraction of each lysate was incubated with glutathione - Sepharose beads coupled to 25 m g of puriﬁed GST - GGA3 PBD at 4 8 C for 2 h . The beads were washed three times with wash buffer ( 50 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 150 mM NaCl , and 1 % Triton X - 100 ) and boiled in 50 m l 1 (cid:2) SDS - PAGE loading buffer for 5 min to release the bound protein into the buffer . The lysates that were not incubated with the beads were used to assess total ARF6 and ERK1 / 2 phosphor - ylation ( ERK1 / 2 - p ) [ 23 ] . ARF6 - GTP bound to the beads and total ARF6 , total ERK1 / 2 and ERK1 / 2 - p in the inputs were determined by immunoblotting using anti - ARF6 ( 1 : 200 dil . ) , anti - ERK1 / 2 ( 1 : 1000 dil . ) and anti - phospho ERK1 / 2 ( 1 : 1000 dil . ) antibodies . 2 . 5 . Immunoblotting Proteins were separated by 12 % SDS - PAGE , transferred onto PVDF membrane and immunoblotted using primary antibodies and the HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies as described earlier [ 25 , 26 ] . 2 . 6 . siRNA transfection The speciﬁc target nucleotide sequence of ARF1 siRNA , ARF6 siRNA and cytohesin 2 siRNA was described previously [ 3 , 24 ] . The siRNA duplex consisting of a unique sequence that does not have signiﬁcant homology to any mammalian gene sequences was used as a negative control . Transfection of 3T3 - L1 cells with siRNA was performed when the cells had reached 30 – 50 % conﬂuency . For a 6 cm 2 plate , 10 m l Lipofectamine RNAiMAX was diluted in 500 m l of OPTIMEM . To this , 100 nM siRNA was added . The resulting mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then added to the cells growing in FSM without antibiotics . After 4 h of incubation , the medium was changed to FSM and left for a further incubation of 44 h and then used for the cell migration assays and immunoblotting . 2 . 7 . Inhibition of ARF activation through penetratin - bound inhibitory peptides The cell - permeating domain of Drosophila antennapedia protein ( penetratin ) and the N - myristoylated ARF1 ( ARF1p ; consists of 2 – 17 aa of ARF1 ) and ARF6 ( ARF6p ; consists of 2 – 13 aa of ARF6 ) peptides fused to penetratin , to give the property of membrane permeability , were used in this assay [ 23 , 24 ] . 5 m M penetratin , 1 . 5 – 10 m M ARF1p - penetratin or 1 . 5 – 10 m M ARF6p - penetratin were added to designated wells during the cell migration assay . 2 . 8 . Statistical analyses As described in Oris cell migration and Cell Comb Scratch Assays , preadipocyte migration was quantiﬁed using ImageJ software . Data presented as percentage closure of cell free zone ( Oris cell migration assay ) or scratch ( Cell Comb Scratch Assay ) was subsequently analysed using the statistical analysis software programme , GraphPad Prism . The results are presented as means (cid:4) standard deviation ( SD ) . Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed by one - way ANOVA . A P value < 0 . 05 was considered as statistically signiﬁcant . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . ARF6 and cytohesin 2 are involved in the migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes Cytohesin 2 , ARF1 and ARF6 have recently been shown to be involved in 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte migration [ 3 ] . To conﬁrm the role of these proteins in preadipocyte migration , we ﬁrst studied the effect of down regulation of ARF1 , ARF6 and cytohesin 2 expres - sions on preadipocyte migration using previously validated cytohesin 2 , ARF6 and ARF1 siRNAs [ 3 , 24 ] . The speciﬁc down regulation of target proteins using siRNA was assessed by immunoblotting ( Fig . 1A ) . ARF1 expression was signiﬁcantly reduced ( approximately 80 % ) in ARF1 siRNA transfected cells but not in either ARF6 or cytohesin 2 or negative control siRNA transfected cells . Similarly ARF6 and cytohesin 2 expression was considerably depleted ( approximately 90 % ) only in the cells transfected with ARF6 and cytohesin 2 siRNAs respectively . Depletion of ARF6 and cytohesin 2 by siRNA treatment signiﬁcant - ly reduced migration of preadipocytes as assessed by the Oris cell migration assay ( Fig . 1B ) . As observed previously [ 3 ] , the reduction in ARF1 protein expression had the least effect on preadipocyte migration ( 76 . 46 % (cid:4) 6 . 145 vs . 87 . 75 % (cid:4) 6 . 374 in control , P < 0 . 05 ) . ARF6 protein depletion resulted in a greater reduction in preadipo - cyte migration ( 57 . 71 % (cid:4) 5 . 328 vs . control , P < 0 . 001 ) . The greatest reduction in preadipocyte migration was observed in cells with down regulation of cytohesin 2 protein expression ( 45 . 31 % (cid:4) 6 . 171 vs . control , P < 0 . 001 ) . 3 . 2 . Penetratin coupled ARF6p preferentially inhibits 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte migration To conﬁrm the preferential involvement of ARF6 in the migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes , the inhibitory peptides of ARF1 and ARF6 ( ARF1p and ARF6p ) were utilised [ 24 , 27 , 28 ] . ARF1p and ARF6p peptides were coupled to the cell - permeating domain of Drosophila antennapedia protein ( penetratin ) to make them membrane permeable . As shown in Fig . 2A , penetratin had no effect on 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte migration whereas ARF1p - pene - tratin and ARF6p - penetratin inhibited preadipocyte migration . However , ARF6p - penetratin was more efﬁcient than ARF1p - penetratin in inhibiting preadiopcyte migration . Both penetratin coupled ARF1p ( Fig . 2B ) and ARF6p ( Fig . 2C ) inhibited migration of preadipocytes in a dose - dependent manner but greater inhibition was observed in preadipocytes exposed to ARF6p - penetratin . ARF1p - penetratin had no effect on preadipocyte migration at 1 . 25 m M ( 92 . 72 % (cid:4) 5 . 480 vs . 96 . 81 % (cid:4) 2 . 432 in control ) but showed inhibition at higher dose , the maximal affect was at 10 m M dose ( 68 . 23 % (cid:4) 3 . 653 vs . 96 . 81 % (cid:4) 2 . 432 in untreated control , P < 0 . 001 ) . However , ARF6p - penetratin signiﬁcantly inhibited preadipocyte migration at 1 . 25 m M ( 59 . 38 % (cid:4) 3 . 423 vs . 84 . 90 % (cid:4) 4 . 6 in control , P < 0 . 001 ) . Inhibition of migration increased with increasing dose to 10 m M ( 41 . 15 % (cid:4) 3 . 653 vs . control , P < 0 . 001 ) . These observations , like those seen in the case for siRNA treatment , highlighted the preferential involvement of ARF6 in migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipo - cytes . This corresponds with the greater role for ARF6 over ARF1 in preadipocyte migration described earlier [ 3 ] . 3 . 3 . ARF6 and ERK1 / 2 are activated during 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte migration following scratching A previous study revealed successive activation of ARF6 and ERK1 / 2 during migration of hepatoma cells [ 16 ] . Since ARF6 is required for preadipocyte migration , we hypothesised ARF6 activation during preadipocytes migration . As the wells of Oris cell migration plates we used are of a 96 - well format , the Cell Comb Scratch Assay in 1 - well format was employed to scale up the migration assay to assess biochemical events during preadipocyte cell migration . We ﬁrst assessed cell migration using the Cell Comb Scratch Assay . As shown in Fig . 3A , preadipocytes have migrated 68 . 49 % width of the scratch within 4 h . Unlike in the Oris cell migration assay , the scratch closed completely within 24 h in the Cell Comb Scratch Assay . This is because the diameter of cell free J . C . B . Davies et al . / Biochemical Pharmacology 92 ( 2014 ) 651 – 660 653 zone in Oris cell migration plate is 2 . 5 mm whereas the width of cell free zones obtained following the cell comb scratch is about 0 . 2 mm . We next assessed whether ARF6 and ERK1 / 2 get activated during cell migration using the Cell Comb Scratch Assay ( Fig . 3B / C & 4 ) . As shown in Fig . 3B , ARF6 was activated within 5 min after scratching and the ARF6 - GTP levels were maintained between 5 . 4 - fold ( 5 min ) and 5 . 7 - fold ( 240 min ) relative to that in unscratched cells ( basal levels ) during the time course of the scratch assay . ERK1 / 2 was also activated ( through phosphoryla - tion ) by scratching but the activation occurred later ( 30 min after the scratching ) when compared to ARF6 activation ( Fig . 3 C ) . Similar to the ARF6 activation , ERK1 / 2 activation was maintained between 6 . 5 - fold ( 30 min ) and 6 . 1 - fold ( 240 min ) relative to that in unscratched cells . However , we did not observe ARF6 and ERK1 / 2 Fig . 1 . Migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes is affected by cytohesin 2 and ARF6 depletion . 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes transfected with siRNA for either negative control , ARF1 , ARF6 or cytohesin 2 for 48 h were subjected to either immunoblotting ( A ) or Oris Pro Cell Migration assay ( B ) . ( A ) The siRNA transfected cells were lysed and 30 m g protein of each sample was fractionated by SDS - PAGE , immunoblotted with anti - tubulin , anti - ARF1 , anti - ARF6 or anti - cytohesin 2 primary antibodies and down regulation of the target protein was assessed by scanning the blots . ( B ) Oris cell migration assay wells were seeded with siRNA transfected 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes and incubated for 0 h ( pre - migration control ) or 24 h to permit cell migration . Then the cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and stained with DAPI . Migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes into cell free zone ( marked by a circle ) was determined using the InCell Analyzer 2000 ( upper panel ) , images processed with ImageJ software and cell migration is presented as percentage closure of the cell free zone ( lower panel ) . The percentage of cell free zone closure done in duplicate is displayed as means (cid:4) SD of 3 separate experiments . * P < 0 . 05 , * * * P < 0 . 001 compared with no treatment . Fig . 2 . 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte migration is inhibited preferentially by penetratin coupled ARF6 inhibitory peptide . The Oris Pro Cell Migration assay wells seeded with 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes were incubated independently with 5 m M penetratin , 5 m M ARF1p - pentratin and 5 m M ARF6p - penetratin ( A ) or varying concentrations ( 1 . 25 – 10 m M ) of ARF1p - penetratin ( B ) and ARF6p - penetratin ( C ) for 24 h to permit cell migration . At the end of migration , the cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and stained with DAPI . Migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes was determined as described in Fig . 1 . * * P < 0 . 01 , * * * P < 0 . 001 compared with no treatment . J . C . B . Davies et al . / Biochemical Pharmacology 92 ( 2014 ) 651 – 660 654 activation above the basal levels after complete closure of the scratch ( 24 h after scratching ) by preadipocytes migration ( Fig . 4 ) . This result revealed the activation of ARF6 and ERK1 / 2 during migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes . 3 . 4 . Cytohesin 2 ARF GEF regulate 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte migration The depletion of cytohesin 2 has been shown to prevent the activation of ARF6 , but not ARF1 , during preadipocyte migration , indicating that ARF6 is the substrate for cytohhesin 2 GEF activity [ 3 ] . To determine the role of cytohesin 2 and ARF6 in preadipocyte migration , we ﬁrst studied the effect of various concentrations ( 6 . 25 – 50 m M ) of SecinH3 , a chemical inhibitor for the ARF6 activation by cytohesins , on 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte migration over 24 h [ 7 ] . SecinH3 inhibited the migration signiﬁcantly at 6 . 25 m M ( 53 . 65 % (cid:4) 3 . 072 vs . 87 . 50 % (cid:4) 5 . 929 in control , P < 0 . 001 ) and maximum at 50 m M ( 38 . 02 % (cid:4) 6 . 379 vs . control , P < 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 5A ) . At 50 m M SecinH3 , more than 60 % of migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes was inhibited . This result indicates the involvement of cytohesin 2 in the migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes through ARF6 activation [ 3 ] . 3 . 5 . Inhibition of ARF6 inactivation increases migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes To further assess the requirement of ARF6 activation in 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte migration , an ARF GAP inhibitor ( QS11 ) was used to prevent ARF6 inactivation during migration . QS11 , a small purine derivative is a broad spectrum ARF GAP inhibitor [ 8 ] . A dose dependent effect of QS11 ( 6 . 25 – 50 m M ) on preadipocyte migration was tested . As shown in Fig . 5B , migration of preadipocytes was unaffected by 6 . 25 m M and 12 . 5 m M of QS11 . However , there was a slight increase in preadipocyte migration in the presence of 25 m M QS11 ( 89 . 58 % (cid:4) 3 . 48 vs . 80 . 73 % (cid:4) 6 . 379 in control , P < 0 . 01 ) and the migration slightly increased further with 50 m M QS11 treatment ( 91 . 77 % (cid:4) 4 . 097 vs . 80 . 73 % (cid:4) 6 . 379 in control , P < 0 . 001 ) . This result indicates further that the GTP - bound ARF6 is important for preadipocyte migration . 3 . 6 . PIP 2 and PI3K are essential effectors for 3T3 - L1 preadipocye migration A recent study revealed the necessity of second messenger PIP 3 , which produced by PI3K , in the recruitment of cytohesin 2 to the plasma membrane during cell migration and the membrane recruited cytohesin 2 for activation of ARF6 [ 29 ] . We have also previously shown the PI3K - dependent translocation of cytohesins 1 – 3 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane , where they activate ARF6 [ 9 – 13 ] . To investigate the role of PIP 3 in migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes , a chemical inhibitor of PI3K ( LY294002 ) was used . LY294002 is a reversible and selective inhibitor of PI3K with the advantage of an increased half - life in comparison to the other PI3K inhibitors such as wortmannin Fig . 3 . Assessment of time - dependent migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes and the activation of ARF6 and ERK1 / 2 during preadipocytes migration by Cell Comb Scratch Assay . 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes were grown to conﬂuent cell monolayers were scratched using the cell comb and incubated for 0 – 24 h to allow migration of preadipocytes .

Davies et al . / Biochemical Pharmacology 92 ( 2014 ) 651 – 660 655 [ 30 ] . Inhibition of PI3K prevents the formation of second messenger PIP 3 , which subsequently inhibits cytohesin 2 recruit - ment to the plasma membrane and thereby the activation of ARF6 . ARF6 - GTP binds and activates PI 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase ( PIP5K ) , leading to a large increase in PIP 2 levels at the cell surface [ 31 ] . ARF6 - GTP and PIP 2 function synergistically to recruit AP - 2 ( a component of the clathrin coat complex ) , suggesting a role for ARF6 in clathrin mediated internalisation essential for cell migration [ 24 ] . PIP 2 sequestering peptide PBP10 , which is a decapeptide derived from the PIP 2 - binding region in segment 2 of gelsolin [ 32 ] , was used to study the role of PIP 2 in preadipocyte migration . As shown in Fig . 6 , sequestering of PIP 2 with PBP10 resulted in signiﬁcant inhibition of preadipocyte migration ( 53 . 13 % (cid:4) 4 . 419 vs . 83 . 05 % (cid:4) 3 . 429 in control , P < 0 . 01 ) . Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 also led to signiﬁcant reduction in preadipocyte migration ( 40 . 94 % (cid:4) 3 . 977 vs . control , P < 0 . 001 ) . These observations high - light the importance of PIP 2 and PI3K in preadipocyte migration . BFA , an ARF GEF inhibitor that does not prevent the ARF6 activation , did not affect preadipocyte migration ( Fig . 6 ) . 3 . 7 . ERK1 / 2 and dynamin play a role in preadipocytes migration Hu and colleagues revealed ERK1 / 2 and Rac1 activation following ARF6 activation at the plasma membrane during cell migration [ 16 ] . ARF6 dependent activation of ERK1 / 2 and Rac1 in epithelial tubule development was also described [ 18 ] . Dynamin is an important GTPase in the process of cell migration , where it regulates focal adhesion disassembly to allow detachment from surrounding cells [ 19 ] . Dynamin , along with Rac1 , also regulates cell migration through participation in extracellular matrix degradation and lamellipodial accumulation at the leading edge of the cell [ 19 ] . To determine the role of ERK1 / 2 and dyanamin in preadipocyte migration , chemical inhibitors PD98059 and dynasore were used . PD98059 is a speciﬁc inhibitor for the phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 by mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase ( MAPKK ) . Dynasore is a small molecule inhibitor of dynamin [ 24 ] . As shown in Fig . 7A , inhibition of ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation with 12 . 5 m M PD98059 resulted in signiﬁcant inhibition of preadipocyte migration ( 62 . 03 % (cid:4) 9 . 667 vs . 82 . 34 % (cid:4) 5 . 859 in control , P < 0 . 01 ) .

The Oris Pro Cell Migration assay wells seeded with 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes were incubated for 24 h to permit cell migration in the presence of varying concentrations ( 6 . 25 – 50 m M ) of the cytohesin inhibitor SecinH3 ( A ) or ARF GAP inhibitor QS11 ( B ) . After that , the cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and stained with DAPI .

Davies et al . / Biochemical Pharmacology 92 ( 2014 ) 651 – 660 656 of preadipocytes decreased with increasing dose of PD98059 , reaching maximal inhibition at 50 m M ( 46 . 85 % (cid:4) 9 . 917 vs . control , P < 0 . 001 ) . At 50 m M of PD98059 , migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes was reduced by almost half that of the control , conﬁrming ERK1 / 2 involvement in preadipocyte migration . As shown in Fig . 7B , inhibition of dynamin with dynasore also reduced the migration of preadipocytes . At 6 . 25 m M dynasore , migration was signiﬁcantly inhibited ( 52 . 08 % (cid:4) 4 . 27 vs . 85 . 42 % (cid:4) 7 . 569 in control , P < 0 . 001 ) and the inhibition increased further with increasing concentration to 50 m M ( 28 . 23 % (cid:4) 9 . 441 vs . control , P < 0 . 001 ) . At 50 m M dynasore , migration of preadipocytes was reduced to less than a third that of the control . Taken together , these results demonstrate the importance of ERK1 / 2 and dynamin in preadipocyte migration . Like in Oris cell migration assay , SecinH3 , PD98059 and dynasore also inhibited preadipocyte cell migration after scratching , indicating that the results obtained using the Cell Comb Scratch Assay are comparable with those of Oris cell migration assay ( Fig . 8 ) . When we assessed cell viability using an alamar blue assay , none of inhibitors at the highest concentration used in cell migration assay had any effect on preadipocytes viability ( data not shown ) . This indicates that the effect of inhibitors used in this study on preadipocytes migration is speciﬁc . 3 . 8 . ERK1 / 2 and dynamin are downstream signalling effectors of ARF6 Since inhibition of cytohesin , MAPKK and dynamin lead to slowdown of 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte migration , we further investi - gated whether these signalling molecules regulate cell migration by altering the activity of ARF6 and ERK1 / 2 . For this purpose , the cell migration inhibitors effect , at an optimal concentration , on the activation of ARF6 and ERK1 / 2 during preadipocytes migration was assessed . As shown in Fig . 9A , there was a 5 - fold increase in ARF6 - GTP levels during 240 min cell migration . In the presence of SecinH3 ( a cytohesin inhibitor ) or LY294002 ( a PI3K inhibitor ) , cell migration - induced ARF6 - GTP was reduced to basal levels , which correlated with the observed inhibition of preadipocyte migration . Treatment of preadipocytes with QS11 ( an ARF GAP inhibitor ) did slightly increased the ARF6 - GTP levels ( 5 . 7 - fold ) . However BFA ( an ARF GEF inhibitor that does not prevent ARF6 activation ) , PD98059 ( a MAPKK inhibitor ) , PBP10 ( a PIP 2 sequestering peptide ) and dynasore ( a dynamin inhibitor ) had no effect on the cell migration - induced activation of ARF6 . As shown in Fig . 9B , there was a 6 . 4 - fold increase in ERK1 / 2 - phosphorylation / activation during 240 min of cell migration . SecinH3 inhibited the ERK1 / 2 activation ( 2 . 2 - fold vs . 6 . 4 - fold in control ) whereas QS11 increased the ERK1 / 2 activation to 8 . 9 - fold , the highest levels of ERK1 / 2 - phosphorylation in the assay . As seen with the ARF6 activation , BFA and dynasore had no effect on the cell migration - induced activation of ERK1 / 2 . However , PD98059 inhibited ERK1 / 2 activation ( 2 . 1 - fold vs . 6 . 4 - fold in control ) , which correlated with the inhibition of migration observed with PD98059 treatment . In the presence of PBP10 or LY294002 , ERK1 / 2 Fig . 6 . Inhibition of PI3K and depletion of PIP 2 reduced 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte migration . The Oris Pro Cell Migration assay wells seeded with 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes were treated with PIP 2 sequestering peptide PBP10 ( 10 m M ) , the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 ( 50 m M ) or an ARF GEF inhibitor BFA ( 50 m M ) and incubated for 0 h ( pre - migration control ) or 24 h to permit cell migration . At the end of cell migration , the cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and stained with DAPI .

After that , the cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and stained with DAPI .

Davies et al . / Biochemical Pharmacology 92 ( 2014 ) 651 – 660 657 phosphorylation was also reduced to basal levels , correlating with the observed inhibition of preadipocyte migration . These results demonstrate that preadipocyte migration signals through the PI3K and cytohesin ARF GEF mediated activation of ARF6 , followed by that of ERK1 / 2 . This is suggested as PD98059 inhibited preadipo - cyte migration and ERK1 / 2 activation during the migration but had no effect on the activation of ARF6 . Previously we have shown that ARF6 act upstream of dynamin , by activating it through NM23 - H1 , and clathrin , by generating PIP 2 through the activation of PIP5K [ 24 ] . Dyanmin has also shown to act down stream of ERK1 / 2 [ 20 , 21 , 33 ] . Dynasore and PBP10 had no effect on cell migration - induced ARF6 activation though they inhibit preadiocyte migra - tion , indicating that dynamin and PIP 2 are also likely to act downstream of ARF6 in cell migration . Like the ARF6 activation , cell migration - induced ERK1 / 2 activation was also unaffected by dynasore and this suggests that dynamin may act downstream of ARF6 and ERK1 / 2 . However , ERK1 / 2 activation during cell migration was affected by PBP10 , suggesting that PIP 2 may act upstream of ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation . 4 . Discussion The involvement of ARF6 in preadipocyte migration has recently been described [ 3 ] . In this study we have shown that inhibition of ARF6 activation by SecinH3 results in decreased migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes . In addition , prevention of ARF6 inactivation with an ARF GAP inhibitor ( QS11 ) slightly increases preadipocyte migration , highlighting further the requirement of active , GTP - bound , ARF6 for cell migration . Consistent with this , the siRNA - mediated down regulation of ARF6 and cytohesin 2 proteins expression in preadipocytes results in a substantial reduction in migration of preadipocytes . ARF6 involvement in 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte migration is also conﬁrmed by using the membrane - permeable penetratin - coupled ARF6p inhibitory pep - tide . Taken together these results conﬁrm a previous study [ 3 ] that 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte migration is regulated through the activation of ARF6 by cytohesin 2 . To complement the cell migration studies , the activation of ARF6 during cell migration was biochemically analysed . The second messenger PIP 3 , generated by PI3K , recruits cytohesins , through their PH domains , to the plasma membrane , where they regulate ARF6 activation [ 9 , 34 – 36 ] . It is well known that the activated ARF6 causes several morphological changes at the plasma membrane , including the formation of cortical actin [ 1 , 12 , 37 ] .

Inhibition of cytohesin , ERK1 / 2 and dynamin activation affects migration of 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes in Cell Comb Scratch Assay . 3T3 - L1 preadipocytes grown to conﬂuent cell monolayers in 1 - well plates were incubated without or with inhibitors for 1 h , scratched using the cell comb and incubated again without or with inhibitors for 4 h to allow migration of preadipocytes .

Davies et al . / Biochemical Pharmacology 92 ( 2014 ) 651 – 660 658 cytohesins 2 and 3 to the plasma membrane during migration of breast carcinoma SUM159 cells has recently been demonstrated [ 29 ] . In this study , 3T3 - L1 preadipocyte migration and ARF6 activation during the migration were shown to be inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor ( LY294002 ) , indicating cytohesin 2 recruitment to the plasma membrane during cell migration is through PIP 3 . In MDCK cells , ARF6 activated during HGF induced tubule development has been found to signal through ERK1 / 2 and Rac1 [ 18 ] . More recently , ARF6 has been shown to regulate EGF induced human hepatoma cell migration by signalling through down - stream activation of ERK1 / 2 and Rac1 [ 16 ] . Rac1 has been shown to be accumulated with dynamin at the leading edge of the cell during migration , where it regulates cellular events such as actin cytoskeleton reorganisation [ 19 ] . ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation has been shown to stimulate the interaction of dynamin with cortactin , leading to the actin cytoskeleton remodelling responsible for cell migration [ 20 , 21 ] . These studies highlight the involvement of ERK1 / 2 , dynamin and Rac1 in ARF6 - mediated actin remodelling during cell migration . The involvement of ERK1 / 2 and dynamin in preadipocyte migration demonstrated here could possibly be the link between ERK1 / 2 and Rac1 in actin cytoskeleton reorganisation at the plasma membrane in the process [ 19 ] . It is also possible that dynamin might be the stage at which pathways diverge following the ARF6 activation in cell migration . Dynamin , which participates in ﬁssion of clathrin - coated vesicles , is activated by ARF6 - GTP through recruiting NM23 - HI , a dynamin activator , to the membrane [ 24 ] . Recently , PIP 2 and clathrin have been shown to participate in cell migration . The AP2 , which is a part of clathrin coat complex , interacts with PIP 2 at the cell membrane to initiate cell migration [ 38 ] . In this study , PIP 2 sequestering abolished cell migration and ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation but had no effect on ARF6 activation , conﬁrming the involvement of PIP 2 downstream of ARF6 and upstream of ERK1 / 2 in cell migration . This is consistent with a previous study , which suggested PIP 2 regulation of ERK1 / 2 activation during stress induced apoptosis [ 33 ] . Although how PIP 2 regulates ERK1 / 2 activation is unclear , it is possible that the regulation could involve PI mediated regulation of Raf , which regulates ERK1 / 2 activation through the MAPK pathway [ 39 ] . Preadipocyte migration is important for lipid metabolism . Reduced preadipocyte migration through inhibition of ARF6 / cytohesin2 could have negative consequences on the storage of cellular lipids . Moreover , adipocyte over - nutrition as a result of perturbed preadipocyte migration is potentially a key factor in the initiation of insulin resistance [ 4 ] . There remains the possibility of other GEFs such as BRAGs 1 – 3 and EFA6 acting on ARF6 during the process of migration [ 14 ] . However , there is no evidence for these GEFs expression in preadipocyte . In addition to PIs , scaffolding protein paxillin plays an important role in the recruitment of cytohesin to the plasma membrane during cell migration [ 3 ] . Scaffolding proteins such as cytohesin 3 / Grp1 signalling partner ( GRSP ) [ 34 ] , Grp1 - associated scaffold protein ( GRASP ) / tamalin [ 40 , 41 ] , cytohesin - associated scaffold protein ( CASP ) / cytohesin interacting protein ( CYTIP ) [ 42 , 43 ] and interaction protein for cytohesin exchange factors ( IPCEF ) 1 [ 44 ] are also involved in cytohesin recruitment . IPCEF1 and GRASP have also been found to promote signalling of cytohesin 2 and Rac GEF Dock 180 during migration of MDCK cells [ 45 ] . It has been suggested that GRASP and IPCEF1 are responsible for recruitment of cytohesin 2 to the plasma membrane and thereby promoting ARF6 activation , which in turn recruits the Dock180 / ELMO complex for activation of Rac1 at the plasma membrane [ 45 ] . It is possible that different combinations of ARF6 GEFs and Rac1 GEFs act together to induce downstream membrane remodelling events in different cell types . Therefore , more work regarding this aspect would yield a greater detail of the molecular mechanisms underlying preadipocyte migration . ERK1 / 2 has shown to be involved in ARF6 induced activation of Rac1 during EGF induced migration of HepG2 cells [ 16 ] . It is therefore possible that ERK1 / 2 may also act as an intermediate between ARF6 and Rac1 in preadipocyte cell migration . Cytohesin 2 and ARF6 are also key signalling components of the insulin receptor , where inhibition of these effectors causes blocking of insulin signalling and thereby insulin resistance [ 7 , 22 ] . Therefore , in addition to adipocyte over - nutrition , the imbalance between insulin signalling and migration of the preadipocyte could also play a role in insulin resistance . These pathways and the signalling molecules common to both the pathways are of particular interest , considering the close associa - tion between obesity and insulin resistance . For instance in the case of hyperinsulinaemia , there could be a possible competition between these two signalling pathways , where increased insulin signalling through the insulin receptor recruits cytohesins and ARF6 to the receptor , causing an imbalance favouring redistribu - tion of the signalling components from the leading edge of the preadipocyte . Further elucidation of molecular mechanisms could yield signiﬁcant ﬁndings , leading to therapeutics for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes . In summary , we proposed a pathway for ARF6 / cytohesin 2 mediated preadipocyte migration based on this study ( Fig . 10 ) , cytohesin 2 recruits , by binding to PI3K lipids product ( PIP 3 ) , to the plasma membrane ( PM ) , where it activates ARF6 . The active ARF6 then increases PIP 2 levels , which leads to phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 and subsequent activation of dynamin , causing actin cytoskeleton remodelling beneath the plasma membrane that required for cell migration .
