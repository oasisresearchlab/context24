Summary Plasma membrane sphingomyelin ( SM ) binds the Helicobacter pylori vacuolating toxin ( VacA ) to the surface of epithelial cells . To evaluate the impor - tance of SM for VacA cellular entry , we character - ized toxin uptake and trafficking within cells enriched with synthetic variants of SM , whose intracellular trafficking properties are strictly dependent on the acyl chain lengths of their sph - ingolipid backbones . While toxin binding to the surface of cells was independent of acyl chain length , cells enriched with 12 - or 18 - carbon acyl chain variants of SM ( e . g . C12 - SM or C18 - SM ) were more sensitive to VacA , as indicated by toxin - induced cellular vacuolation , than those enriched with shorter 2 - or 6 - carbon variants ( e . g . C2 - SM or C6 - SM ) . In C18 - SM - enriched cells , VacA was taken into cells by a previously described Cdc42 - dependent pinocytic mechanism , localized initially to GPI - enriched vesicles , and ultimately trafficked to Rab7 / Lamp1 compartments . In contrast , within C2 - SM - enriched cells , VacA was taken up at a slower rate by a Cdc42 - independent mechanism and trafficked to Rab11 compartments . VacA - associated predominantly with detergent - resistant membranes ( DRMs ) in cells enriched with C18 - SM , but predominantly with non - DRMs in C2 - SM - enriched cells . These results suggest that SM is required for targeting VacA to membrane rafts important for subsequent Cdc42 - dependent pinocytic cellular entry . Introduction Chronic infection with the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is a signiﬁcant risk factor for the development of peptic ulcer disease , distal gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric lymphoma in humans ( Suerbaum and Josenhans , 2007 ; Cover and Blaser , 2009 ) . The vacuolating cytotoxin ( VacA ) is an intracellular - acting toxin that is important for Helicobacter pylori colonization and disease pathogen - esis ( Telford et al . , 1994 ; Salama et al . , 2001 ; Fujikawa et al . , 2003 ) . Intoxication of epithelial cells with VacA results in multiple consequences , including vacuolation and apoptosis ( Cover and Blanke , 2005 ) . VacA is internalized into epithelial cell lines by a Cdc42 - dependent pinocytic mechanism , and is trafficked to late endosomal / lysosomal compartments ( Molinari et al . , 1997 ; Papini et al . , 1997 ; McClain et al . , 2000 ; Gauthier et al . , 2005 ; 2006 ; 2007 ) . As the ﬁrst step during cellular intoxication , VacA binds to the plasma membrane of sensitive cells ( Garner and Cover , 1996 ) , analogous to other intracellular - acting bacterial toxins ( Blanke , 2006 ) . Recently , sphingomyelin ( SM ) was identiﬁed as a plasma membrane receptor that confers cellular sensitivity to VacA by binding the toxin to the cell surface ( Gupta et al . , 2008 ) . However , this previous study did not address whether SM is required also for Cdc42 - dependent pinocy - tic uptake from the plasma membrane and trafficking of VacA to late endosomal / lysosomal compartments . The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether , subsequent to binding VacA to the cell surface ( Gupta et al . , 2008 ) , SM might also be important for toxin internal - ization and / or intracellular trafficking . To investigate this possibility , we studied the internalization of VacA into cells enriched with synthetic variants of SM , whose intracellular trafficking properties are strictly dependent on the length of the sphingolipid backbone acyl chain ( Koivusalo et al . , 2007 ) . These studies revealed that although toxin binding was independent of SM acyl chain length , cells enriched with 12 - or 18 - carbon acyl chain variants of SM ( C12 - SM or C18 - SM respectively ) were more sensitive to VacA than cells enriched with shorter 2 - or 6 - carbon variants ( C2 - SM or C6 - SM respectively ) . In C18 - SM - enriched cells , VacA was internalized by a previously described Cdc42 - dependent pinocytic mechanism , localized initially to GPI - enriched vesicles , and then trafficked to Rab7 / Lamp1 rich compartments ( Gauthier et al . , 2004 ; 2005 ; 2006 ; 2007 ) . In contrast , using C2 - SM - enriched cells , VacA was taken up at a slower rate by a Cdc42 - independent mecha - nism and trafficked to Rab11 rich compartments . Finally , VacA was demonstrated to associate predominantly with Received 15 December , 2009 ; revised 5 April , 2010 ; accepted 11 May , 2010 . * For correspondence .

Results Plasma membrane SM is taken up into VacA - containing intracellular compartments Our earlier work demonstrated the importance of SM for binding VacA to the surface of mammalian cells ( Gupta et al . , 2008 ) , but did not address the requirement for SM during subsequent steps of intoxication . If plasma mem - brane SM is important for VacA entry into cells , then it is reasonable to predict that both toxin and sphingolipid are taken up into the same intracellular compartment . To evaluate this possibility , monolayers of AZ - 521 human - derived gastric cells , which have been extensively used to investigate VacA interactions with epithelial cells ( Yahiro et al . , 1997 ; 1999 ; Nakayama et al . , 2004 ; 2006 ) , were pre - chilled on ice and then incubated with pre - chilled Venus - lysenin , a ﬂuorescent version of a SM - binding protein from earthworm ( Kiyokawa et al . , 2005 ) , and either Alexa Fluor 647 - labelled VacA , or , Alexa ﬂuor 568 labelled - transferrin ( as an unrelated control ) . During the incubation period on ice , ﬂuorescence microscopy con - ﬁrmed the absence of intracellular VacA , transferrin or lysenin ( data not shown ) . After 1 h , the cells were washed to remove unbound proteins , and further incubated at 37°C to allow internalization . After 30 min , ﬂuorescence microscopy revealed visible puncta of colocalized VacA and Venus - lysenin ( Fig . 1A ) , indicating that plasma mem - brane SM and VacA were present in the same intracellular vesicles , and supporting the idea that during toxin inter - nalization , SM is taken up along with VacA from the cell surface . Intracellular colocalization of VacA with Venus - lysenin was apparent 10 min after warming the cells to 37°C ( data not shown ) , indicating that uptake of surface - bound toxin and SM occurs rapidly after switching to conditions permissive for cellular entry . Venus - lysenin colocalized with transferrin - containing vesicles to a sig - niﬁcantly lower degree than VacA - containing vesicles ( Fig . 1A and B ) , suggesting that plasma membrane SM is not internalized to the same extent in all protein uptake pathways . VacA - mediated cellular vacuolation , but not binding , is dependent on SM acyl chain length An earlier study reported that VacA binding to the surface of cells is strongly correlated to SM levels , as the deple - tion of plasma membrane SM with the membrane imper - meable sphingomyelinase C ( SMase C ) resulted in a dose - dependent reduction in toxin binding ( Gupta et al . , 2008 ) . However , the use of cells depleted in plasma mem - brane SM for studying VacA internalization is problematic , 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 VacA / lysenin transferrin / lysenin c o l o c a li z a t i on i nde x P = 0 . 003 7 µm 7 µm A B merged VacA / lysenin merged transferrin / lysenin lysenin mergedVacA / lysenin transferrin lysenin merged transferrin / lysenin VacA Fig . 1 .

Colocalization of Alexa Fluor 647 labelled - VacA ( 50 nM ) or Alexa Fluor 568 labelled - transferrin ( 60 nM ) in AZ - 521 cells with Venus - lysenin ( 1 m M ) after 30 min was determined as described in Experimental procedures .

R . Gupta , B . A . Wilson and S . R . Blanke © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 12 , 1517 – 1533 because the low levels of surface - bound toxin avai - lable for uptake result in nearly undetectable levels of intracellular VacA ( Gupta et al . , 2008 ) . As an alternative strategy for ascertaining a potential functional role for SM during cellular entry , we investigated the internalization of VacA into cells enriched with synthetic variants of SM whose intracellular trafficking properties are dependent on the length of the sphingolipid backbone acyl chain ( Koivusalo et al . , 2007 ) . Speciﬁcally , 12 - and 18 - carbon acyl chain variants ( C12 - SM and C18 - SM respectively ) were reported to be trafficked preferentially from the plasma membrane to late endosomal - like vesicles along the degradation pathway , whereas shorter 2 - and 6 - carbon acyl chain variants ( C2 - SM and C6 - SM respec - tively ) were demonstrated to be trafficked preferentially to recycling compartments ( Koivusalo et al . , 2007 ) . Although a distribution of SM acyl chain length variants normally exists within biological membranes , the longer chain vari - ants , and in particular C16 - SM and C18 - SM , are typically more abundant than short - chain variants ( Barenholz , 1984 ; Valsecchi et al . , 2007 ) . Because VacA induces vacuole biogenesis from within late endosomal / lysosomal compartments ( Papini et al . , 1997 ; Gauthier et al . , 2005 ; Genisset et al . , 2007 ) , we predicted that if SM is important for the uptake and trafficking of toxin to these intracellular compartments , then cells enriched in C12 - SM or C18 - SM , which are normally trafficked preferentially from the plasma membrane to late endosomes , would be more susceptible to VacA than cells enriched in C2 - SM or C6 - SM , which are typically trafficked from the plasma membrane to recycling compartments . Alternatively , we predicted that if the importance of SM does not extend beyond binding VacA to the plasma membrane , then cel - lular intoxication should be independent of SM acyl chain length . Prior to evaluating the requirement of SM for VacA uptake and intracellular trafficking , it was important to ﬁrst compare VacA binding to cells enriched with each SM acyl chain variant . The SM headgroup for each variant used in this study was phosphorylcholine , which had earlier been demonstrated to be important for VacAinteractions ( Gupta et al . , 2008 ) , leading us to predict that VacA binding to the plasma membrane of SM - enriched cells should be inde - pendent of backbone acyl chain length . To test this predic - tion , we measured VacA binding to monolayers of AZ - 521 cells enriched with C2 - SM , C6 - SM , C12 - SM , C18 - SM , or a non - synthetic preparation of membrane extracted SM with normal variance in acyl chain lengths ( hereafter referred to as ‘membrane extracted - SM’ ) . In preliminary studies , we conﬁrmed our previous work using other cell lines ( Gupta et al . , 2008 ) , by demonstrating that the overall binding of VacAto the surface ofAZ - 521 cells is strictly dependent on cellular SM levels ( Figs S1 and S2 , Table S1 ) . However , these current studies revealed that nearly identical levels of VacA were bound to the surface of cells enriched in C2 - SM , C6 - SM , C12 - SM , C18 - SM or membrane extracted - SM ( Fig . 2A ) . Similar data were obtained using HeLa cells ( data not shown ) , indicating that these ﬁndings were not idiosyncratic to AZ - 521 cells . These results con - ﬁrmed that VacA binding to cells is independent of SM acyl chain length , thus setting the stage for evaluating the sensitivity of these same cells to VacA under conditions where equal amounts of toxin are bound to the cell surface . To evaluate whether or not VacA cellular activity is dependent on SM acyl chain length , we measured toxin - mediated vacuolation of AZ - 521 cells enriched with C2 - SM , C6 - SM , C12 - SM or C18 - SM . In preliminary studies , we demonstrated that the sensitivity of AZ - 521 cells to VacA is strictly dependent on SM levels ( Figs S3 – S6 , Table S1 ) , which conﬁrmed our previous work using other cell lines ( Gupta et al . , 2008 ) . These current experiments revealed that VacA induced visibly ( Fig . 2B ) and quantitatively ( Fig . 2C ) more vacuolation of cells enriched with C12 - SM or C18 - SM than of cells enriched with C2 - SM or C6 - SM . Similar results were obtained using HeLa cells ( data not shown ) . The decreased vacuolation detected within C2 - SM and C6 - SM - enriched cells was not due to depleted sphingolipid within these cells , as each of the SM acyl chain length variants was incorporated into SMase C pretreated cells to approximately the same extent ( Fig . S7 ) . These results indicated that , in contrast to plasma membrane binding ( Fig . 2A ) , VacA - dependent vacuolation was strictly dependent on SM acyl chain length , suggesting that SM is important for VacA intoxica - tion pathway at steps beyond toxin binding . Because cells enriched with C2 - SM or C18 - SM yielded the greatest contrast in cell sensitivity to VacA , we used these two variants in subsequent studies of toxin uptake and trafficking . The rate , but not overall amount , of VacA uptake into cells is sensitive to variation in SM acyl chain length To evaluate the possibility that SM might be impor - tant for the overall levels of VacA taken into cells , we measured toxin internalization into AZ - 521 cells enriched in either C2 - SM or C18 - SM . These experi - ments revealed that within C2 - SM or C18 - enriched cells , similar amounts of VacA had been internalized at 30 , 60 and 120 min ( Fig . 3 ) . However , at 5 and 15 min , signiﬁ - cantly less VacA was detected within cells enriched with C2 - SM than in cells with C18 - SM . These results indi - cated that the initial rate at which VacA is taken up into cells from the plasma membrane is dependent on SM acyl chain length , and supports the idea that plasma membrane SM impacts the uptake pathway by which VacA enters cells . Sphingomyelin targets VacA for cellular entry 1519 © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 12 , 1517 – 1533 VacA uptake is sensitive to variation in SM acyl chain length The difference in the rates of VacA internalization from the surface of cells enriched in C2 - SM or C - 18 ( Fig . 3 ) sug - gested that SM might inﬂuence the overall pathway by which VacA is taken into cells . To evaluate this possibility , we compared VacA localization with intracellular compart - ments containing the ﬂuid phase marker Texas - Red - dextran , which was reported previously to accompany the pinocytic uptake of VacA ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) . These studies revealed that after 10 min , signiﬁcantly more VacA colocalized with Texas - Red - dextran in cells enriched with C18 - SM , similar to mock - pretreated cells , than in cells enriched with C2 - SM ( Fig . 4A ) . The VacA / dextran colo - calization index in C2 - SM - enriched cells did not increase at later time points ( up to 2 h , data not shown ) , indicating that the relatively low amount of VacA / dextran colocaliza - tion in C2 - SM - enriched cells at 10 min relative to C18 - SM - enriched cells is not likely due to differences in the initial rates of toxin uptake ( Fig . 3 ) . Shortly after uptake from the plasma membrane , VacA localizes to GPI - anchored protein enriched endosomal compartments , called GEECs ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) . To further evaluate the relationship between plasma mem - brane SM and the cellular uptake pathway of VacA , we compared VacA localization with GEECs in cells that had been enriched with either C2 - SM or C18 - SM . In these Fig . 2 . Effects of SM acyl chain length on cell binding and sensitivity to VacA . AZ - 521 cells were incubated with SMase C ( 50 mU ml - 1 ) for 1 h at 37°C , and then chilled on ice to 0°C . The cells were washed with ice - cold complete cell medium to remove SMase C . The cells were then incubated for 30 min on ice in the absence or presence of pre - chilled C2 - SM , C6 - SM , C12 - SM , C18 - SM or membrane extracted SM ( all at 25 m M ) . The cells were further incubated with pre - chilled Alexa Fluor 488 - labelled VacA ( 50 nM ) ( A ) or unlabelled VacA ( 50 nM ) ( B , C ) . After 1 h , the cells were analysed for VacA binding ( A ) or further incubated at 37°C and under 5 % CO 2 ( B , C ) . A . The level of VacA binding was determined using ﬂow cytometry . Cell binding was calculated by determining the geometric mean ﬂuorescence intensities of each sample . The results shown were derived from data combined from three independent experiments in which binding was normalized to control cells that had been mock - pretreated with complete cell medium prior to VacA binding . Statistical signiﬁcance was calculated for differences in VacA binding between those cells pretreated sequentially with SMase C alone or SMase C and acyl chain variants of SM , and those cells pretreated with SMase C and then ‘membrane extracted’ SM . B . After 8 h , the cells were stained with neutral red and visualized using DIC microscopy . C . Cellular vacuolation was quantiﬁed using the neutral red assay . The results shown were derived by normalizing neutral red uptake to that measured in control cells that had been mock - pretreated with complete cell medium prior to VacA binding .

Blanke © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 12 , 1517 – 1533 studies , we used DIC / ﬂuorescence microscopy to deter - mine VacA colocalization with ﬂuorescent aerolysin ( ASSP ) , which is a commonly used pan GPI - anchored protein probe ( Fivaz et al . , 2002 ) . These studies revealed signiﬁcantly more VacA colocalized with ASSP in cells enriched with C18 - SM than in cells enriched with C2 - SM ( Fig . 4B ) . In C2 - SM - enriched cells , the VacA / ASSP colo - calization index did not increase at later time points ( up to 2 h , data not shown ) . Taken together , these results indi - cated that longer acyl chain SM promotes VacA uptake into vesicles enriched in ﬂuid phase and GPI - anchored proteins to a greater extent than shorter chain length SM , and provides further support for the idea that plasma membrane SM inﬂuences the uptake pathway by which VacA enters cells . The Cdc42 dependence of VacA uptake is sensitive to variation in SM acyl chain length The small GTP - binding protein Cdc42 was previously reported to be important for the uptake of VacA into cells and toxin - dependent vacuolation ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) . To evaluate the importance of plasma membrane SM for Cdc42 - dependent entry of VacA , we compared VacA internalization into either C2 - SM or C18 - SM - enriched AZ - 521 cells that had been transiently transfected with an expression plasmid containing the gene encoding a dominant - negative form of Cdc42 [ Cdc42 ( T17N ) – GFP ] , which had earlier been demonstrated to inhibit VacA uptake into cells ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) . These studies revealed that for both C18 - SM - enriched cells and mock - pretreated cells , there were considerably fewer intracellu - lar VacA - containing vesicles in transfected cells than in non - transfected cells ( Fig . 5A ) , as indicated by the presence or absence of GFP ﬂuorescence respectively . In contrast , an approximately equal number of VacA - containing vesicles were detected in transfected and non - transfected cells enriched in C2 - SM ( Fig . 5A ) , suggesting that for cells enriched in short - chain acyl variants , VacA uptake was not Cdc42 dependent . Internalization of trans - ferrin ( as an unrelated control ) was not sensitive to dominant - negative Cdc42 – GFP in AZ - 521 cells enriched in either C2 - SM or C18 - SM ( Fig . 5B ) . These results indi - cated that longer acyl chain SM promotes a Cdc42 - dependent uptake mechanism , as previously described for VacA ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) , and suggested that plasma membrane SM inﬂuences the mechanism by which VacA was taken up from the cell surface . Localization of VacA to intracellular compartments is sensitive to variation in SM acyl chain length The differences observed in VacA uptake between cells enriched in C2 - SM or C18 - SM ( Figs 4 and 5 ) suggested that intracellular trafficking of VacA might also be depen - dent on SM . Previously , trafficking of VacA to compart - ments rich in late endosomal ( Rab7 ) and lysosomal ( Lamp1 ) markers was demonstrated to be required for toxin dependent cellular vacuolation ( Papini et al . , 1994 ; Molinari et al . , 1997 ; Ricci et al . , 1997 ; Gauthier et al . , 2005 ; 2007 ) . To evaluate the importance of plasma mem - brane SM for intracellular trafficking of VacA to late endosomal compartments , we investigated VacA locali - zation to Rab7 - rich vesicles in AZ - 521 cells enriched in either C2 - SM or C18 - SM . DIC / ﬂuorescence microscopy revealed that at 60 min , signiﬁcantly more VacA had local - ized to Rab7 - associated vesicles in C18 - SM - enriched cells or mock - pretreated cells than in C2 - SM - enriched cells ( Fig . 6A ) . Likewise , signiﬁcantly more VacA has localized to Lamp1 - associated vesicles ( Fig . S8 ) in C18 - SM - enriched cells or mock - pretreated cells than in C2 - SM - enriched cells ( Papini et al . , 1994 ; Molinari et al . , 1997 ; Li et al . , 2004 ; Gauthier et al . , 2007 ) . These results are consistent with the idea that plasma membrane SM targets VacA to the uptake and trafficking pathway required for toxin action ( Papini et al . , 1994 ; Ricci et al . , 1997 ) . The relatively low levels of VacA cellular activity ( Fig . 2B and C ) and toxin localization to late endosomal / lysosomal compartments ( Fig . 6A , Fig . S8 ) in C2 - SM - enriched cells , compared with cells enriched with C18 - SM , suggested that , subsequent to binding and uptake , VacA trafficking 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 5 15 30 60 120 C2 - SM enriched cells C18 - SM enriched cells P = 0 . 008 P = 0 . 04 P = 0 . 04 P = 0 . 1 P = 0 . 2 time ( min ) i n t e r na li z a t i on ( % c on t r o l ) Fig . 3 .

Localization of VacA to intracellular vesicles enriched in Rab7 or Rab11 is sensitive to variation in SM acyl chain length . Intracellular Alexa Fluor 647 labelled VacA ( 50 nM ) was visualized for colocalization with Rab7 ( A ) or Rab11 ( B ) using DIC ﬂuorescence microscopy after internalization for 120 min ( A ) or 30 min ( B ) into AZ - 521 cells that had been supplemented with either C2 - SM or C18 - SM , as described in Experimental procedures . Within the larger merged images of VacA and Rab7 ( A ) or Rab11 ( B ) , the areas within the dashed white box were enlarged as solid white boxes located in the lower , right hand corners of the merged images , to illustrate VacA ( red puncta ) , Rab7 or Rab11 ( green puncta ) , or VacA colocalized with either Rab7 or Rab11 ( yellow - coloured puncta ) . The white puncta in the smaller , upper black and white images illustrate , as labelled , VacA ( A and B ) , Rab7 ( A ) , or Rab11 ( B ) . The smaller , bottom panels are the DIC images provided to illustrate the overall shape of the cell ( s ) , and include the black scale bars . The colocalization index was determined for VacA with Rab7 ( A ) or VacA with Rab11 ( B ) in cells enriched in C2 - SM , cells enriched in C18 - SM , or cells that had not been pretreated prior to incubation with VacA . The colocalization index values were derived from data that had been combined from three independent experiments . Statistical signiﬁcance was calculated for differences in the colocalization between VacA and Rab7 ( VacA - Rab7 ) ( A ) and , VacA and Rab11 ( VacA - Rab11 ) ( B ) . 1524 V . R . Gupta , B . A . Wilson and S . R . Blanke © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 12 , 1517 – 1533 may be fundamentally different in cells enriched in long or short acyl chain length variants of SM . Notably , short acyl chain variants of SM ( e . g . C2 - SM , C6 - SM ) were previ - ously demonstrated to be trafficked preferentially from early endosomal compartments to recycling compart - ments ( Koivusalo et al . , 2007 ) . To evaluate the possibility that subsequent to uptake into C2 - SM - enriched cells , VacA is routed preferentially to recycling compartments , we examined the relative localization of VacA with Rab11 - associated recycling vesicles ( Lakadamyali et al . , 2006 ) in AZ - 521 cells enriched with either C2 - SM or C18 - SM . These experiments revealed signiﬁcantly more VacA localization to Rab11 - associated vesicles in C2 - SM - enriched cells than in either C18 - SM - enriched cells or mock - pretreated cells ( Fig . 6B ) . VacA localization within C18 - SM or C2 - SM - enriched cells at 60 min ( Fig . 6B ) was very similar to those observed at 120 min ( data not shown ) . Control experiments revealed that localization of epi - dermal growth factor ( EGF ) to Rab7 / Lamp1 - associated compartments was essentially identical in cells enriched in C2 - SM or C18 - SM ( data not shown ) , validating that the normal trafficking of EGF from the cell surface to late endosomes ( Futter et al . , 1996 ) is independent of SM acyl chain length . These results also suggest that the apparent re - routing of VacA to Rab11 - associated recycling vesicles cannot readily be explained by inactivation of all protein trafficking along the late endosomal / lysosomal degrada - tion pathway within C2 - SM - enriched cells . Partitioning of VacA into membrane raft and non - raft domains of the plasma membrane The differences observed between the cell entry ( Figs 4 and 5 ) and routing ( Fig . 6 ) pathways of VacA within cells enriched in C2 - SM or C - 18 suggested that , prior to uptake , VacA association with SM on the surface of these cells might be fundamentally different . We hypothesized that the acyl chain variants might affect the association of VacA with membrane rafts on the surface of sensitive cells , which previous studies have indicated to be impor - tant for toxin function ( Patel et al . , 2002 ; Schraw et al . , 2002 ; Geisse et al . , 2004 ; Nakayama et al . , 2006 ; Gupta et al . , 2008 ) . To evaluate this possibility , we investigated VacA association with DRMs , which are the biochemical correlates of membrane rafts , in cells that had been enriched with C2 - SM , C12 - SM or C18 - SM , taking advan - tage of our ﬁnding that overall toxin binding to cells is independent of SM acyl chain length ( Fig . 2A ) . These experiments revealed that for both C18 - SM - enriched cells and mock - pretreated cells , approximately 80 % of the total membrane - bound VacA was detected in low - density DRMs ( Fig . 7A and B ) , as previously reported in studies using a number of different cell lines ( Patel et al . , 2002 ; Schraw et al . , 2002 ; Gupta et al . , 2008 ) . In contrast , nearly equivalent amounts of VacA were detected in DRMs and non - DRM fractions prepared from C12 - enriched cells , while in cells enriched with C2 - SM , VacA was detected predominantly in the less buoyant fractions near the bottom of the gradient , suggesting that the toxin was associated primarily with non - ordered domains within the lipid bilayer . When cells with bound VacA were incu - bated at 37°C for 30 min to allow for uptake of the toxin from the plasma membrane and intracellular transport , we again detected VacA predominantly in the low - density DRMs from C18 - SM - enriched cells and mock - pretreated cells ( data not shown ) . These results were consistent with an earlier report , indicating that VacA association with rafts is not substantially altered during the early stages of endocytosis ( Nakayama et al . , 2006 ) . Likewise , VacA remained associated predominantly with less buoyant membrane fractions from cells enriched with C2 - SM ( data not shown ) , suggesting VacA had not partitioned into membrane rafts during the early stages of endocytosis in these cells . The association of the membrane raft marker ﬂotillin with DRMs was similar in cells enriched with C18 - SM , C12 - SM or C2 - SM ( Fig . 7A ) , indicating that variations in SM acyl chain length do not alter the membrane distri - bution of all raft - associated proteins . Consistent with results obtained from ﬂow cytometric analysis ( Fig . 2A ) , the overall amount of cell - associated VacA was largely independent of SM acyl chain length ( Fig . 7C ) . Interest - ingly , based on our ﬁndings that the total amount of VacA internalized is independent of acyl chain length ( Fig . 3 ) , our data indicate that VacA is taken up into cells regard - less of whether the toxin is associated with raft or non - raft domains of the plasma membrane . However , our results also support a model where SM - dependent targeting of surface - bound VacA into membrane raft domains is required for the uptake pathway and intracellular routing of VacA required for toxin activity . Discussion The susceptibility of eukaryotic cells to intracellular - acting bacterial toxins is largely dictated by the availability of speciﬁc toxin receptors ( Blanke , 2006 ) . Recently , we iden - tiﬁed SM as a plasma membrane receptor that confers sensitivity to VacA by binding the toxin to the cell surface ( Gupta et al . , 2008 ) . However , this previous study did not address whether SM is required also for subsequent Cdc42 - dependent pinocytic uptake and trafficking of VacA to late endosomal / lysosomal compartments , which is important for toxin mediated vacuolating activity . Our results here indicated that SM is required for tar - geting VacA to the uptake pathway previously demon - strated to be important for cellular intoxication . Using cells enriched with synthetic variants of SM that each binds Sphingomyelin targets VacA for cellular entry 1525 © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 12 , 1517 – 1533 VacA to the same extent , we observed that the properties of toxin uptake and intracellular localization was strictly dependent on SM acyl chain length . Cells enriched with C18 - SM , which is naturally abundant in biological mem - branes ( Barenholz , 1984 ; Valsecchi et al . , 2007 ) , took up and localized toxin by a previously described Cdc42 - dependent pinocytic pathway into GEECs ( Figs 4 and 5 ) ( Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ; Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) , and then trafficked to late endosomal / lysosomal vesicles ( Fig . 6 ) , which had previously been demonstrated to be important for toxin - mediated cellular vacuolation ( Molinari et al . , 1997 ; Papini et al . , 1997 ; McClain et al . , 2000 ; Gauthier et al . , 2005 ; 2006 ; 2007 ) . In contrast , VacA internalization and localization were fundamentally different within cells enriched with C2 - SM , which is typically present at very low abundance within biological membranes ( Barenholz , 1984 ; Valsecchi et al . , 2007 ) , as toxin was taken into cells at a slightly slower rate ( Fig . 3 ) by a Cdc42 - independent mechanism ( Fig . 5 ) and trafficked to Rab11 - associated recycling compartments ( Fig . 6 ) . We did not further char - acterize the uptake of VacA into C2 - SM - enriched cells , as there is no existing evidence that this pathway is normally important during VacA intsoxication . How might SM - dependent association of VacA with the plasma membrane promote toxin internalization by a Cdc42 - dependent pinocytic pathway into GEECs ? SM was earlier reported to be essential for VacA association with membrane rafts ( Gupta et al . , 2008 ) , and rafts had earlier been reported to be important for toxin internaliza - tion ( Patel et al . , 2002 ; Schraw et al . , 2002 ; Geisse et al . , 2004 ; Gauthier et al . , 2005 ; Nakayama et al . , 2006 ; Gupta et al . , 2008 ) . Our studies here revealed for the ﬁrst time that SM - mediated partitioning of VacA between raft and non - raft domains on the plasma membrane surface is strictly dependent on acyl chain length ( Fig . 7 ) . Several studies have demonstrated that longer SM acyl chain variants ( C - 18 and above ) partition preferentially into ordered gel domains , while shorter chain variants ( C - 10 and below ) partition into disordered ﬂuid domains ( van Meer and Lisman , 2002 ; Koivusalo et al . , 2004 ; 2007 ; Niemela et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly , our ﬁnding that overall levels of internalized VacA were approximately the same in C2 - SM and C18 - SM - enriched cells ( Fig . 3 ) indicates that toxin association with plasma membrane rafts is not strictly required for the internalization of VacA into cells . Nonetheless , as discussed below , our data are consistent with a model that SM - dependent association of VacA with rafts is required for the targeting of the toxin for the Cdc42 - dependent uptake pathway associated with VacA intracellular activity . A potential mechanistic role for SM in Cdc42 - dependent pinocytosis was previously suggested by studies , demon - strating that depletion of SM from the surface of Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells using SMase C inhibited the targeting of Cdc42 to membrane rafts within the plasma membrane required for the uptake of the ﬂuid phase flotillin pretreated C2 - SM C12 - SM C18 - SM ( DRMs ) ( non DRMs ) VacA A ( DRMs ) ( non DRMs ) pretreated C2 - SM C12 - SM C18 - SM B C VacA actin pretreated C2 - SM C12 - SM C18 - SM mock - mock - mock - 0 20 40 60 80 100 pretreated C2 - SM C12 - SM C18 - SM mock - DR M a ss o c i a t ed V a c A ( % t o t a l V a c A ) * * Fig . 7 .

Wilson and S . R . Blanke © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 12 , 1517 – 1533 marker dextran ( Cheng et al . , 2006 ) . Supplementation of SMase C - pretreated CHO cells with exogenous SM , but not ceramide , monosialoganglioside GM3 or lactosylcera - mide , restored cellular uptake of dextran and plasma membrane targeting of Cdc42 ( Cheng et al . , 2006 ) . Although we did not investigate SM - dependent Cdc42 membrane recruitment within VacA - intoxicated cells , we speculate that SM may target VacA to membrane rafts containing the effector molecules required for uptake of the toxin by the Cdc42 - dependent pathway . Several groups have reported that cell surface GPI - anchored proteins are required for efficient cellular entry and vacuolating activity of VacA ( Ricci et al . , 2000 ; Kuo and Wang , 2003 ; Gauthier et al . , 2004 ; 2005 ) . Our studies revealed that the uptake of VacA along with GPI - anchored proteins is dependent on SM acyl chain length ( Fig . 4 ) , suggesting that both SM and GPI - anchored proteins might be required for targeting VacA to GEECs . GPI - anchored proteins are not likely receptors for VacA , as they are not required for required either cell binding or membrane raft association ( Schraw et al . , 2002 ; Kuo and Wang , 2003 ; Gauthier et al . , 2004 ; 2005 ) . In addition , VacA does not induce an increase in ﬂuid phase uptake , nor is toxin uptake inhibited by a blocker of macropinocy - tosis ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) , suggesting that the toxin uptake pathway to GEECs is not induced by VacA cell binding . One model is that VacA exploits an existing mechanism for the recycling of plasma membrane GPI - anchored proteins , for which the level of membrane targeting to GEECs is dependent on the level of GPI - anchored proteins on the plasma membrane ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) . Future studies will be required to clarify the relationship between SM - dependent internalization of VacA to GEECs and the potentiation of VacA cellular activity by GPI - anchored proteins . Trafficking of VacAto Rab7 / Lamp1 enriched intracellular compartments is important for VacAcellular activity ( Papini et al . , 1994 ; Molinari et al . , 1997 ; Ricci et al . , 1997 ; Gauthier et al . , 2005 ; 2007 ) . Our results here suggest that VacA – SM interactions on the plasma membrane are important for the targeting of toxin to these intracellular compartments along the degradation pathway . Toxin - mediated vacuole biogenesis is dependent on VacA channel formation in the late endosomal membrane , which has been proposed to activate the vacuolar ATPase ( V - ATPase ) proton pump resulting in the accumulation of osmotic species , such as NH 4 Cl and late endosomal swell - ing ( Papini et al . , 2001 ; Gauthier et al . , 2004 ; Cover and Blanke , 2005 ) . Active V - ATPase requires both the trans - membrane Vo domain and cytosolic V 1 domain , and recent studies indicated that ratio of membrane associated V 1 / Vo varies along with the endocytic pathway , with a higher relative amount of V1 associated with late endosomes than other endosomal compartments ( Lafourcade et al . , 2008 ) , perhaps explaining the importance of VacA trafficking to late endosomes for toxin - mediated cellular vacuolation to occur . Previous studies suggested a direct link between sphingolipids and membrane assembly and maturation of functional V - ATPase in yeast ( Chung et al . , 2003 ) , but it is unclear whether or not SM has any direct role in activating V - ATPase in mammalian cells during VacA intoxication . The stability of SM acyl chains , and in particular , those of exogenously added SMs , was not experimentally addressed in this study . However , eukaryotic cells have not been reported to modify the acyl chains of intact SM molecules ( Milhas et al . , 2009 ) . Instead , the acyl chains are added during biosynthesis of the SM precursor , cera - mide , which occurs at the cytoplasmic leaﬂet of the endo - plasmic reticulum ( Merrill , 2002 ) . Thus , we suspect that the acyl chain lengths of the exogenous SMs used in these studies remained unchanged during the course of toxin binding and uptake . In summary , our results strongly suggest that the func - tion of SM as a VacA receptor extends beyond binding the toxin to the cell surface . Our current model is that SM targets VacA to membrane rafts required for Cdc42 - dependent pinocytic cellular entry and subsequent traf - ﬁcking to late endosomal / lysosomal compartments . Current studies are focused on identifying SM - dependent raft components required for toxin uptake , as well as the cellular factors required for sorting VacA within early cel - lular compartments to the degradation pathway . Experimental procedures Puriﬁcation of VacA Helicobacter pylori 60190 ( 49503 , ATCC , Manassas , VA , USA ) , were cultured , and VacA was puriﬁed as described previously ( Cover et al . , 1997 ) . Cell culture AZ - 521 cells ( 3940 , Japan Health Science Foundation ) or HeLa cells ( CCL - 2 , ATCC ) were maintained within a humidiﬁed atmo - sphere under 5 % CO 2 at 37°C in ‘complete cell medium’ , which is deﬁned as minimum essential medium ( MEM , Sigma , St Louis , MO , USA ) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine , 50 U penicillin ml - 1 , 50 m g streptomycin sulfate ml - 1 ( Sigma ) and 10 % fetal bovine calf serum ( FBS , JRH Biosciences , Lenexa , KS , USA ) . To deplete plasma membrane SM , cells were pre - incubated with the indicated concentrations of bacterial sphingomyelinase C ( SMase C , Sigma ) followed by washing with ice - cold complete cell medium to remove SMase C . Cells were then incubated further with membrane extracted SM , phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) , phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) , phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) , acetyl sphingomyelin ( C2 - SM ) , hexanoyl sphingomyelin ( C6 - SM ) , lauroyl sphingomyelin ( C12 - SM ) , stearoyl sphingomyelin ( C18 - SM ) ( all from Avanti Polar Lipids , Alabaster , AL , USA ) , or , cho - lesterol ( Sigma ) , at 4°C for 30 min prior to intoxication . For Sphingomyelin targets VacA for cellular entry 1527 © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 12 , 1517 – 1533 controls , cells were mock pretreated with PBS pH 7 . 2 . Cells were never exposed to greater than 1 % solvent ( DMSO / methanol 1 : 1 ) . As quality control , it was established that incubation with the lipid preparations used in these studies did not cause an increase in AZ - 521 cell death ( data not shown ) , as indicated by a commercial live / dead assay ( Invitrogen / Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) . Preparation of Venus - lysenin and non - toxic ASSP The plasmid harbouring the gene encoding non - toxic ASSP was obtained as a gift from Dr F . Van der Goot , and the recombinant non - toxic ASSP was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) ( Novagen , Madison , WI , USA ) and puriﬁed as described ( Fivaz et al . , 2002 ) . The plasmid harbouring the gene encoding Venus - lysenin was a gift from Dr E . Kiyokawa ( Osaka University , Japan ) , and the reombinant protein was expressed in E . coli BL21 and puriﬁed as described ( Kiyokawa et al . , 2005 ) . Cell vacuolation VacA was activated as described ( de Bernard et al . , 1995 ) , and added to cells in the presence of 5 mM NH 4 Cl ( Cover et al . , 1992 ) . Monolayers were visually examined using a Fisher Scien - tiﬁc MicroMaster inverted light microscope ( Fisher Scientiﬁc , Pittsburgh , PA , USA ) , outﬁtted with a Nikon Coolpix 43000 camera . For quantitative analysis , neutral red uptake was mea - sured , as previously described ( Cover et al . , 1991 ) . Relative vacuolation was calculated by dividing neutral red uptake of SMase C and / or lipid pretreated cells by neutral red uptake of cells incubated with VacA alone . For all experiments , neutral red uptake of mock - treated cells ( e . g . minus VacA ) was subtracted from the neutral red uptake of cells incubated with VacA . SM quantiﬁcation Sphingomyelin levels were measured using theAmplex Red Sph - ingomyelinase Assay Kit ( Invitrogen / Molecular Probes ) , accord - ing to manufacturer’s instructions ( He et al . , 2002 ) . Known concentrations of membrane extracted SM , C2 - SM , C6 - SM , C12 - SM and C18 - SM were used as standards . As a standard quality control measure , cellular SM levels were quantiﬁed for every experiment involving depletion or supplementation of cel - lular SM . Labelling VacA and ASSP Puriﬁed VacA and ASSP were conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 , Alexa Fluor 647 , or Alexa Fluor 568 , using the Alexa Fluor Label - ling kit ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Labelling was experimentally determined not to alter VacA - mediated cellular vacuolation activity . Alexa Fluor 568 labelled - transferrin and Alexa Fluor 488 labelled - EGF were from Invitrogen . DIC - epiﬂuorescence microscopy Chamber slides were analysed using a Delta Vision RT micro - scope ( Applied Precision , Issaquah , WA , USA ) , EX 490 / 20 and EM 528 / 38 , EX 555 / 28 and EM 617 / 73 , EX 640 / 20 and EM 685 / 40 , using an Olympus Plan Apo 60 ¥ oil objective with NA 1 . 42 and working distance of 0 . 17 mm . DIC images were col - lected using a Photometrics CoolSnap HQ camera ( Photomet - rics , Tucson , AZ , USA ) . Images were processed using SoftWoRX Explorer Suite ( version 3 . 5 . 1 , Applied Precision , Issaquah , WA , USA ) . Deconvolution was carried out using SoftWoRX con - strained iterative deconvolution tool ( ratio mode ) . Flow cytometry Analytical ﬂow cytometry was carried out using a Coulter EPICS XL - MCL ﬂow cytometer ( Beckman Coulter , Fullerton , CA , USA ) equipped with a 70 mm nozzle , 488 nm line of an air - cooled argon - ion laser , and 400 mV output . The band pass ﬁlter used for detection of cell ﬂuorescence was 525 / 10 nm . Cell analysis was standardized for scatter and ﬂuorescence by using a suspension of ﬂuorescent beads . Events were recorded on a log ﬂuores - cence scale and the geometric mean ﬂuorescence values were determined using FCS Express 3 . 00 . 0311 V Lite Standalone . The data were obtained from at least 10 000 events per sample , gated so that only cells , which were evident by their forward and side scatter properties , were considered , while non - cellular debris ( relatively lower forward and side scatter properties ) were excluded from analysis . VacA binding and internalization AZ - 521 cells were pre - incubated in the absence or presence of SMase C ( 50 mU ml - 1 ) at 37°C . After 1 h , the monolayers were washed with ice - cold complete medium to remove SMase C . The SMase C - treated cells were then further incubated on ice in the absence or presence of pre - chilled C2 - SM , C6 - SM , C12 - SM , C18 - SM or membrane extracted SM ( 25 m M , unless otherwise indicated ) . After 30 min , the cells were further incubated , as indicated , with activated Alexa Fluor 488 - labelled VacA ( 50 nM ) , activated Alexa Fluor 647 - labelled VacA ( 50 nM ) , Alexa Fluor 568 - labelled transferrin ( 60 nM ) or Venus - lysenin ( 1 m M ) . In studies to investigate the rate of VacA internalization , Alexa Fluor 488 - labelled VacA ( 50 nM ) was used . For studies using DIC / epiﬂuorescence microscopy , experi - ments were performed with monolayers of cells in eight - well chamber slides ( Nunc , Rochester , NY , USA ) . For binding , cells were washed once with ice - cold PBS pH 7 . 2 , ﬁxed with paraform - aldehyde ( 4 % ) on ice . For internalization studies , cells were washed once with ice - cold PBS pH 7 . 2 , and then incubated at 37°C in complete cell medium ( pre - warmed to 37°C containing unlabelled VacA , 50 nM , to maintain exposure to VacA during internalization ) . After indicated time points , cells were ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde ( 4 % ) on ice . For studies using ﬂow cytometry , experiments were carried out with suspended cells ( 10 6 cells ml - 1 ) . For binding studies , cells were washed once with ice - cold PBS pH 7 . 2 , and analysed by ﬂow cytometry . For internalization studies , the cells were incu - bated on ice for 5 min in the absence or presence of trypan blue ( 0 . 5 % in PBS pH 7 . 2 ) , which is a membrane - impermeable , Alexa Fluor 488 ﬂuorescence - quenching agent ( Sahlin et al . , 1983 ; Hed et al . , 1987 ) , and then analysed immediately by ﬂow cytom - etry .

For kinetic studies , data were plotted as a fraction of internalized VacA ( + trypan blue ) versus surface VacA ( - trypan blue ) at each time point between mock - pretreated cells and lipid treated cells ( after SMase C pre - treatment ) . For all experiments , the geometric mean ﬂuorescence of mock - treated cells ( e . g . minus VacA ) was subtracted from the geometric mean ﬂuorescence of cells incubated with VacA . Transfection of cells AZ - 521 cells were plated to 70 – 80 % conﬂuency after overnight incubation . After washing with PBS pH 7 . 2 , cells were pre - incubated for 1 h with Opti - MEM I ( reduced serum , antibiotic - free medium , 200 m l , Invitrogen / Gibco , Eugene , OR , USA ) at 37°C and under 5 % CO 2 . Approximately 25 min prior to addition to cells , the appropriate dilutions of plasmid DNA and concentrated Lipofectamine ( Invitrogen ) were prepared according to the manu - facturers instructions , and allowed to incubate for 5 min at 25°C prior to mixing . Equal volumes of plasmid DNA and 6 ¥ Lipo - fectamine , both in Opti - MEM I , were gently mixed , and incubated at 25°C . After 20 min , the plasmid DNA - Lipofectamine mixture ( 100 m l ) was added to each well in a drop - wise fashion with gentle agitation , and the cells were immediately incubated at 37°C and under 5 % CO 2 . For these studies , AZ - 521 cells were transfected with either pcDNA3 - Cdc - 42 ( T17N ) – GFP ( 0 . 4 m g per well ) or pcDNA3 – GFP ( 0 . 4 m g per well ) . After 6 h , Opti - MEM I was removed from the monolayers , and the cells were incubated in complete medium at 37°C and used immediately for the indi - cated studies . Using this protocol , we typically detected 60 – 80 % of the cells within the monolayer to be transfected , as determined by visible EGFP ﬂuorescence . Cdc42 dependence of VacA internalization AZ - 521 cells were transfected with pcDNA3 - Cdc - 42 ( T17N ) – GFP or pcDNA3 – GFP ( both from Addgene , Cambridge , MA , USA ) , pretreated with SMase C , and then supplemented with C2 - SM or C18 - SM , as described above . The monolayers were incubated with either Alexa Fluor 647 - labelled VacA ( 50 nM ) or Alexa Fluor 568 - labelled Tf ( 60 nM ) to allow internalization for 30 min , and examined by DIC - epiﬂuorescence microscopy . In transfected or non - transfected cells , as differentiated by the presence or absence of GFP ﬂuorescence , respectively , the relative number of intracellular VacA - containing intracellular vesicles was quan - tiﬁed by directly counting red puncta from at least 10 cells in several different ﬁelds , and the data presented were combined from three independent experiments . The relative internalization was determined by calculating M T / M NT , which is the ratio of the mean number of VacA - containing intracellular vesicles in pcDNA3 - Cdc - 42 ( T17N ) – GFP transfected cells ( M T ) to the mean number of VacA - containing intracellular vesicles in non - transfected cells ( M NT ) . VacA colocalization with cellular trafficking markers In eight - well chamber slides , 2 ¥ 10 4 AZ - 521 cells were plated in each well . After 24 h , the cells were pre - incubated in the pres - ence of SMase C ( 50 mU ml - 1 ) at 37°C . After 1 h , the monolayers were washed with ice - cold MEM containing 10 % FBS to remove SMase C , and then further chilled on ice . The SMase C - treated cells were then further incubated for 30 min on ice in the absence or presence of pre - chilled C18 - SM ( 25 m M ) or C2 - SM ( 25 m M ) in complete medium . The cells were further incubated with pre - chilled Alexa Fluor 488 - labelled VacA ( 50 nM ) in the absence or presence of Alexa Fluor 568 - labelled Tf ( 60 nM ) or Alexa Fluor 568 - labelled ASSP ( 50 nM ) on ice . In some experiments , cells were further incubated instead , as indicated , with Alexa Fluor 647 - labelled VacA . After 1 h , the monolayers were washed one time with pre - chilled , complete medium plus unlabelled VacA ( 50 nM ) , and then further incubated at 37°C with the addition of pre - warmed complete medium containing unlabelled VacA ( 50 nM ) . In other experiments , the cells were also incubated in the presence of Texas Red - labelled Dextran ( 1 mg ml - 1 ) . At the indicated times , the cells were washed three times with ice - cold PBS pH 7 . 2 , and then ﬁxed with pre - chilled paraformaldehyde ( 4 % ) on ice . For each marker , colocalization was determined after incubation of the cells at 37°C for 10 , 30 , 60 and 120 min . For studies requiring immunostaining , the ﬁxed monolayers were ﬁrst blocked using PBS pH 7 . 2 containing 2 % BSA and then permeabilized by incubating with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS pH 7 . 2 for 10 min on ice , followed by incubation with rabbit polyclonal anti Rab - 7 , anti Rab - 11 ( 1 : 500 ) , or anti - Lamp - 1 ( 1 : 200 ) antibod - ies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) , washed , and then further incubated with anti - mouse Alexa Fluor - 488 ( 1 : 1000 , Invitrogen ) . Images were collected using wide - ﬁeld ﬂuorescence micros - copy , as described above . Colocalization analysis was con - ducted by using the colocalization module of the DeltaVision SoftWoRx 3 . 5 . 1 software suite . Results were expressed as the colocalization index , which was derived from calculating the Pearson’s coefficient of correlation values , which in these studies was a measure of colocalization between VacA and the indicated cellular marker in each z plane of the cell . For each cell , images from an average of 20 – 25 z planes at a thickness of 0 . 2 m M were collected . In these studies , a colocalization index value of 1 . 0 indicates 100 % colocalization of VacA with the indi - cated cellular marker , whereas a colocalization index of 0 . 0 indi - cates the absence of colocalization of VacA with the indicated cellular marker . The colocalization index was calculated from the analysis of approximately ten cells from three independent experiments . Preparation and analysis of DRMs The DRM preparation and analysis were performed as previously described ( Patel et al . , 2002 ; Lingwood and Simons , 2007 ) . DRMs were fractionated using OptiPrep ( Sigma ) density centrifu - gation . AZ - 521 cells ( 5 ¥ 10 6 cells ml - 1 in suspension ) were incu - bated in the absence or presence of SMase C ( 50 mU ml - 1 ) at 37°C . After 1 h , the cells were chilled to 0°C and washed with ice - cold complete cellular medium to remove SMase C . The cells were then incubated on ice with C2 - SM , C12 - SM or C18 - SM ( 25 m M ) . After 30 min , the cells were further incubated on ice with pre - chilled VacA ( 100 nM ) . After 1 h , the cells were washed once with ice - cold complete cellular medium and collected by centrifu - gation at 300 g at 4°C for 5 min . The cell pellet was resuspended in ice - cold TNE buffer ( 25 mM Tris - HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 0 ) containing Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III ( Cal - biochem , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . The suspended cells were lysed by 15 passages through a 25 - gauge needle . Membranes were Sphingomyelin targets VacA for cellular entry 1529 © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 12 , 1517 – 1533 solubilized by adding ice - cold Triton X - 100 ( 1 % ﬁnal concentra - tion in TNE ) and incubating further at 4°C on a rotary shaker . After 30 min , the lysates were adjusted to 40 % Optiprep ( 600 m l ) and loaded into the bottom of SW 40 Beckman tubes , overlaid with 1 . 2 ml of 30 % Optiprep medium ( TNE buffer ) , which was subsequently topped with 200 m l of TNE buffer . The gradients were centrifuged at 50 000 r . p . m . and at 4°C . After 2 h , raft and non - raft fractions ( 1 . 0 ml ) were collected from the top to the bottom of the Optiprep gradient . The fractions were analysed by SDS - PAGE , and VacA was detected by Western blot analysis using VacA rabbit antiserum ( Rockland Immu - nochemicals ) and anti - rabbit IgG - alkaline phosphatase conju - gate ( Sigma ) . Flotillin was used as control for raft fractionation for OptiPrep gradients and detected by Western blot analysis using anti - ﬂotillin - 1 monoclonal antibody ( BD Transduction Laboratories , San Jose , CA , USA ) and anti - mouse IgG - alkaline phosphatase conjugate ( Sigma ) . The cross - reacting material was visualized after treating the blots with Lumi - phos ( Pierce , Rockford , IL , USA ) . Statistics Unless otherwise indicated , all data are representative of those obtained from at least three independent trials , each performed in triplicate . All statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel ( Version 11 . 0 ) . Error bars represent standard deviations . All P - values were calculated with the Student’s t - test using paired , two - tailed distribution . * indicates statistical signiﬁcance ( P < 0 . 05 ) .

The cells were further incu - bated with pre - chilled Alexa Fluor 647 labelled VacA ( 50 nM ) for 1 h on ice . Cells were washed one time with pre - chilled , complete medium plus unlabelled VacA ( 50 nM ) , and then further incu - bated at 37°C with the addition of pre - warmed complete medium containing unlabelled VacA ( 50 nM ) . After 2 h , the cells were ﬁxed , permeabilized , and stained for Lamp1 by incubating with anti - Lamp - 1 antibodies followed by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 . The cells were evalu - ated for VacA colocalization with Lamp - 1 using ﬂuorescence / DIC microscopy . Within the larger merged image of VacA and Lamp1 , the areas within the dashed white box were enlarged as solid white boxes located in the lower , right hand corners of the merged images , to illustrate VacA ( red puncta ) , Lamp1 ( green puncta ) or VacAcolocalized with Lamp1 ( pseudo yellow - coloured puncta ) . The white puncta in the smaller , upper black and white images illustrate , as labelled VacAor Lamp1 . The smaller , bottom panels are the DIC images provided to illustrate the overall shape of the cell ( s ) , and include the black scale bars . The colocalization index was determined for VacA with Lamp1 in cells enriched in C2 - SM , cells enriched in C18 - SM or unpretreated cells . These data were combined from three independent experiments . Sta - tistical signiﬁcance was calculated for differences in the colocal - ization between VacA and Lamp - 1 in cells enriched in either C2 - SM or C18 - SM and control cells that had not been pretreated prior to incubation with VacA .
