Assessing creativity in design education : Analysis of creativity factors in the ﬁrst - year design studio Halime Demirkan and Yasemin Afacan , Department of Interior Architecture and Environmental Design , Faculty of Art , Design and Architecture , Bilkent University , 06800 Bilkent , Ankara , Turkey The aim of this study is to explore creativity in design education and identify the creativity assessment indicators in the ﬁrst - year design studio . A measurement tool of 41 items that consists of the artifact creativity , design elements and assembly of design elements were utilised for the assessment of 210 artifacts . Results of the exploratory and conﬁrmatory factor analysis indicated three main design creativity factors . The primary factor consists of the novelty and aﬀective characteristics of artifact that are associated with its shape . The second factor has the elaboration characteristics that are integrated with its geometric and ﬁgure e ground relations and harmony of design elements . The third factor consists of rhythm , repetition , unity , order and number of design elements . (cid:1) 2011 Elsevier Ltd . All rights reserved . Keywords : Creative design , Creativity , Design education , Design process , Evaluation C reativity as a natural component of design process has often been char - acterised by the ‘creative leap’ that occurs between problem and solu - tion space ( Demirkan , 2010 ) . Since the nature of creativity is so complex , there is no single deﬁnition that fully encompasses this concept and identiﬁes a solution as creative . So , there can be no guarantee that a creative ‘event’ will occur during a design process ( Dorst & Cross , 2001 ) . In design edu - cation , various assessment methods were always discussed and instruments were devised ( Demirbas & Demirkan , 2003 ) .

These could be consid - ered as the products of the design process . 1 An overview of creativity in the design context “In architectural design process the interaction between person , creative process and creative product inside a creative environment should be considered as a to - tal act in assessing creativity” ( Demirkan , 2010 , p . 58 ) . Although these four ele - ments of creativity were claimed to act together , there are studies that focus on each element or interactions between them . There have been previous attempts to understand thecreativepersonal traitsofdesigners ( Candy & Edmonds , 1996 ; Cross , 2002 ; Lawson , 1994 ) . Akin and Akin ( 1998 ) analysed the cognitive pro - cesses of designers in their activities and found that there were also similar acts in the other art ﬁelds such as music , painting and sculpture . This founding was also supported by Christiaans ( 2002 ) study where also he stated that there is no diﬀerence in the judgement of experts and non - experts of design ﬁeld . Over the past years , some researchers investigated the creative processes to de - velop a better understanding of how creative design occurs and tried to deter - mine its relationship with the creative product development ( Roy , 1993 ) . Later , Hennessey ( 1994 ) tried to ﬁnd the fundamental criteria in the assessment procedures of product creativity . Christiaans and Venselaar ( 2005 ) found a high correlation between amount of process knowledge and creativity of the product . Hasirci and Demirkan ( 2003 ) focused on the interaction between person , pro - cess and product inside a creative environment , namely two sixth grade art - rooms . They found that the three elements of creativity ( person , process and product ) were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from each other . Later , these three ele - ments of creativity were investigated deeply by focussing on the cognitive stages of the creative decision making process in a design studio ( Hasirci & Demirkan , 2007 ) . They used observation , protocol analysis and rating scales as tools of assessment . While observation was used during the creative design process , the latter two were carried out after the design process . It was found that the highest correlation was between process and overall creativity . In the creativity literature , there are many studies that analyse whether there exists an interrelation between person , process and product elements of design creativity . In the previous studies of Hasirci and Demirkan ( 2003 , 2007 ) , per - son , process and product were considered as independent elements of creativ - ity . Furthermore , to redeﬁne the elements of creativity from a new perspective , the overall factors and the interactions among the elements were analysed within the design domain ( Demirkan & Hasirci , 2009 ) . The main ﬁnding of this study was that the product element is the strongest factor ( 45 . 85 % ) in de - Assessing Creativity in design education 263 termining the amount of creativity in design process . The second ( 19 . 54 % ) and third factors ( 14 . 46 % ) both consist of person and process elements . Casakin and Kreitler ( 2008 ) focused on the correspondences and divergences between instructors and students for assessing creativity in the design studio . Later , they tested the validity of self - perceived creativity as the measure of cre - ativity ( Kreitler & Casakin , 2009 , 2010 ) . Among the nine creativity indicators ( ﬂuency , ﬂexibility , elaboration , functionality , innovation , fulﬁlling design re - quirements , considering context , mastery of skills related to aesthetics in rep - resentation and overall creativity ) , only three indicators ( ﬂuency , ﬂexibility and overall creativity ) were found to be positive and signiﬁcant . Dorst and Cross ( 2001 ) claimed that “ [ s ] tudying creative design is seen as problematic because there can be no guarantee that a creative ‘event’ will oc - cur during a design process , and because of the diﬃculty of identifying a solu - tion idea as ‘creative’ . However , in every design project creativity can be found” ( p . 426 ) . In the literature , there are other studies that investigated the composition of product creativity by analysing the elements of product crea - tivity from the perspective of consumers ( Horn & Salvendy , 2006 , 2009 ) . They constructed a conceptual product creativity assessment model within the context of information processing model . As a result , they identiﬁed six product creativity factors ; resolution , emotion , centrality , importance , desire and novelty . In this model , comprehension of product creativity is limited to the expert’s experience with the product functions as well as understanding of functionality within the scope of visual perception . Later , the model was tested on the web - based evaluations of chairs and lamps and also with the pa - per based evaluations ( Horn & Salvendy , 2009 ) . The previously stated six product creativity factors were reﬁned by conducting the exploratory factor analyses that resulted in three main product creativity factors ; aﬀect , impor - tance and novelty that explained 72 % of the common variance . This study showed the factors of product creativity from the consumer perception of product within the context of satisfaction and purchasability . Based on the previous research involving creativity , product development and design , this study deﬁnes design creativity as the conceptual judgement of the design instructors . Mostly in the design literature , a product is deﬁned as a ﬁnalised three dimensional object . However , in the design process , the ﬁnal drawing is considered as the ﬁnal product . In order to diﬀerentiate it from the three dimensional product , it will be referred as ‘artifact’ within the study . Based on the previous studies in the literature that found product as the pow - erful element of creativity in design domain ( Demirkan & Hasirci , 2009 ; Horn & Salvendy , 2009 ) , this study focuses on the artifact ( in terms of product ) el - ement of creativity . Furthermore , it is intended to reﬁne and integrate the ar - tifact creativity with the characteristics and principles of design elements . Also , 264 Design Studies Vol 33 No . 3 May 2012 the creativity assessment tool that can be used for identifying the factors in the artifact creativity was developed and tested for its internal validity . The devel - oped tool that was composed of three factor model was further tested for its stability with a maximum likelihood conﬁrmatory factor analysis . 2 Model Basedonthepreviousresearchinvolvingcreativityindesignproducts , thedimen - sions of creativity are named as the artifact creativity , the design elements and the assembly of design elements . In the creativity literature , it is found that these is - sues are examined independently and the interactions among them are not inves - tigated . This study tries to itemise each dimension and delves deeper by analysing the interactions among these dimensions . To be a creative design product , the ar - tifact should have certain characteristics of creativity ( items ) in terms of novelty ( new , novel , unusual , unconventional , unique , original , infrequent , extraordi - nary , diﬀerent , eccentric and exciting ) , elaboration ( integrated , polished , reﬁned , adequate , deliberate , detailed , sensible , balanced and coherent ) and aﬀective as - pects ( appealed , delighted , good and pleasant ) . An expert in the ﬁeld of design creativity can assess the creativity characteristics of an artifact . This study is based on the previous study that has identiﬁed certain characteristics of the arti - fact creativity ( Hasirci & Demirkan , 2007 ) . Also , the literature related to the product creativity has been studied ( Besemer & Treﬃnger , 1981 ; Besemer , 1998 ; Christiaans , 2002 ; Demirkan & Hasirci , 2009 ; Hasirci & Demirkan , 2003 ; O’Quin & Besemer , 1999 , 2006 ; Runco , 2004 ; Simonton , 2003 ) , in order to obtain certain measurements of creativity that ﬁt to the artifact assessment . According to art , architecture and design educators , there is a need for a formal visual language , which is formalised and clariﬁed by basic principles of design , to attain a degree of originality in the cognitive , aﬀective and psychomotor do - mains of creativity ( Wallschlaeger & Busic - Snyder , 1992 ) . In Demirkan and Hasirci’s ( 2009 ) study , basic principles of design that are the design elements and the assembly of design elements were also considered as the hidden dimen - sions of creativity . The design elements were deﬁned as the characteristics of design that are important in creating a pattern and listed as shape / form , col - our , space , line value and texture . Furthermore , the way design elements come together were called as the assembly of design elements that were listed as harmony , emphasis , rhythm , unity , variety , repetition and balance . In this study , shape , size , number , proportion , geometric relations , ﬁgure e ground relation and colour are considered as the design elements . Shape is de - ﬁned as “the outline or contour of an element” ( Olgunturk & Demirkan , 2011 , p . 271 ) . For this study , the subjects were restricted to use regular geometric shapes ; square , triangle and circle and their derivatives . Size is how small or large is an element or group of elements and number is the quantity of elements . Proportion is the relationship between parts of the elements with respect to magnitude , quantity or degree ( Ching , 2007 ) . The way the geometries connect Assessing Creativity in design education 265 one to another is called the geometric relationship . Figure e ground relationship is the relationship between the design ﬁgures ( parts of composition ) and back - ground information ( design ﬁeld ) that is the paper in this artifact . “Colour is a sensation produced by visible electromagnetic radiation ( light ) that stimulates receptors in our eyes” ( Olgunturk & Demirkan , 2011 , p . 271 ) . Assemblyofdesignelementsisanactthatcanberepeatedly , variablyanddepend - ably done with elements to produce some sort of visual eﬀect in a design ﬁeld . In this study , the assembly of design elements involves harmony , rhythm , unity , variety , repetition , balance and order . Harmony brings together a composition with similar design elements . Rhythm is achieved through the orderly repetition of any design element . Unity is the way individual elements of the design relate to each other and to the total design . Variety can be achieved when certain charac - teristics of the elementsare changed . Asan example , repeating a similar shape but changing the size can give variety . Repetition is the use of the same design ele - ments without any change . Balance is the consideration of visual weight and im - portance of design elements with respect to the design ﬁeld . The relationship of grouping or placing designelementsis called order ( Arnheim , 1977 ; Ching , 2007 ) . The aim of the study is to determine the items that can be evaluated as the characteristics of design creativity for assessing it in design education . Further - more , it intends to explore the interaction among the artifact creativity , the de - sign elements and the assembly of design elements with the use of exploratory and conﬁrmatory factor analyses . 3 Methodology 3 . 1 Participants and artifact The sample was comprised of 210 ﬁrst - year design students of the Department of Interior Architecture and Environmental Design at Bilkent University . Seventy - nine percent ( n ¼ 166 ) of the subjects were female . Firstly , the subjects were asked to choose a pattern from nature . Then , they had to analyse carefully the structure and geometric shapes of the selected pat - tern . Based on this analysis , then they should make an abstraction of the se - lected natural pattern . The subjects were asked to design an artifact inspired from nature consisting of regular geometries and then to colour it . Artifact in Figure 1 is inspired from a leaf and in Figure 2 from the trunk of a tree . 3 . 2 Assessment tool The design creativity assessment tool consists of the individual assessments of the artifact creativity , the design elements and the assembly of design elements dimensions . Based on the review and appraisal of the literature on product / ar - tifact creativity and experience on the creativity rating scales , 31 items were de - termined as the characteristics of artifact creativity . Also , 8 items as the design 266 Design Studies Vol 33 No . 3 May 2012 elements and 10 items as the assembly of design elements were decided . Two ex - perts within the ﬁeld were asked to mark each item on a 5 - point Likert scale ( 1 ¼ poor ; 2 ¼ poor - average ; 3 ¼ average ; 4 ¼ average - excellent ; 5 ¼ excellent ) . Expert one has 32 years of experience in design discipline and involved with the creativity studies more than 20 years . Expert two has 10 years of experience in the design ﬁeld and a well - trained rater . Besides having experienced raters , this study is based on the literature that reports the relevant scientiﬁc information for the calculation of a conﬁdence interval for intra - class correlation to assess the inter - rater reliability of the studies ( Shoukri , Asyali , & Donner , 2004 ) . Since there were 210 ﬁrst - year design students as subjects , two raters were providing an acceptable level of reliability for the assessment of the creativity tool . With the sample size of 210 and 2 raters , the variance of the estimated intra - class cor - relation coeﬃcient was minimised . Figure 1 Artifact example ( Factor 1 ¼ 43 points ; Factor 2 ¼ 35 points and Factor 3 ¼ 16 points ) . Figure 2 Artifact example ( Factor 1 ¼ 37 points ; Factor 2 ¼ 18 points and Factor 3 ¼ 9 points ) . Assessing Creativity in design education 267 Initially to verify the appropriateness and stability of the instrument , a pilot study was conducted with a small sample . The overall internal consistency was veriﬁed to insure the consistency of the assessments ( a ¼ 0 . 967 , n ¼ 49 items ) . After the pilot study , some items that do not match with the artifact were eliminated . The rating scale was reﬁned by eliminating 4 items from the artifact creativity , 1 item from the design elements and 3 items from the assembly of design elements that do not apply to this speciﬁc artifact . Total of 41 items were kept at the ﬁnal rating scale ( Table 1 ) . The ﬁrst dimension measures the artifact characteristics that are associated with creativity . These items are based on the previous studies in the literature on the product creativity ( Besemer & Treﬃnger , 1981 ; Besemer , 1998 ; Christiaans , 2002 ; Horn & Salvendy , 2006 , 2009 ; O’Quin & Besemer , 1999 , 2006 ) and the artifact creativity ( Demirkan & Hasirci , 2009 ; Hasirci & Demirkan , 2003 , 2007 ) . The second and third dimensions are the design elements and the assem - bly of design elements that are important issues in creating designs and they are substantial values in the design process . In the previous studies , these items were assessed as the independent items of creativity and evaluated within their own group without considering their interactions ( Demirkan & Hasirci , 2009 ; Hasirci & Demirkan , 2003 , 2007 ) . This study goes further and tries to ﬁnd out how these items can be integrated in the assessment of design creativity . The assessment was done with 41 items by the two experts independently ; thus the possibility of aﬀecting each other while assessing the artifacts were elimi - nated . The raw averages of the two scores were calculated for the ﬁnal scores . The ﬁrst aim of the study was to evaluate the measurement model by using the exploratory factor analysis and after to evaluate the structural model of the study by using the conﬁrmatory factor analysis . All data analysis was per - formed using SPSS version 15 . 0 and LISREL 8 . 8 ( Joreskog & Sorbom , 2011 ) for the conﬁrmatory factor analysis . 4 Results 4 . 1 Exploratory factor analysis of design creativity An examination of the descriptive statistics and internal validity of the rating scale items was conducted . The mean scores for the design creativity items Table 1 Dimensions and related items of design creativity assessment tool Design creativity dimension Measurement items Artifact creativity Integrated , coherent , detailed , reﬁned deliberate , polished , balanced , signiﬁcant , adequate , sensible , different , unconventional , infrequent , extraordinary , exciting , zippy , fresh , eccentric , new , novel , unusual , unique , original , pleasant , good , delighted , appealed Design elements Shape , colour , size , proportion , number , geometric relations , ﬁgure e ground relation Assembly of design elements Harmony , rhythm , unity , variety , repetition , balance , order 268 Design Studies Vol 33 No . 3 May 2012 ranged from 2 . 44 to 3 . 50 with standard deviation from 1 . 13 to 3 . 17 . Cron - bach’s Alpha for each of the 41 items ranged from 0 . 967 to 0 . 974 , indicating satisfactory internal consistency . In order to determine the factors of design creativity , maximum likelihood fac - tor analysis was conducted . Initially , 5 factors had eigenvalues equal to or greater than 1 . 00 with the explained variance 67 . 5 % . Among the 5 factors , 3 of them had at least 3 items and the rest had less , thus , these 3 factors were considered in this study . These 3 factors accounted for the 62 . 3 % of the var - iance as seen in Table 2 . The maximum likelihood extraction method is used ( c 2 ¼ 1417 . 12 , df ¼ 625 , p < 0 . 001 ) . An orthogonal factor rotation was performed using the Varimax with Kaiser Normalisation . According to Tabachnick and Fidell ( 1996 ) , the item’s pure measure of the factor increases with greater loading . Items that had relationships 50 % and above with the factor were thought to describe the factor and its related scale the best , thus those items would provide the best assessment for the particular case . Therefore , 16 items that had loadings above 0 . 50 were eligible items in describing the ﬁrst factor ( Table 3 ) . It is found that the primary factor , which was responsible of 50 . 2 % of the total variance , is composed 16 items that are associated with the novelty character - istics ( new , novel , unusual , unconventional , unique , original , infrequent , ex - traordinary , diﬀerent , eccentric and exciting ) and the aﬀective characteristics ( appealed , delighted , good and pleasant ) of the artifact as well as its shape . The second factor , which was responsible of 9 . 3 % of total variance , has 12 items that are associated with the elaboration characteristics ( integrated , pol - ished , reﬁned , adequate , deliberate , detailed , sensible , balanced and coherent ) of the artifact as well as with the geometric , ﬁgure e ground relations and har - mony of the design elements . The third factor , which was responsible of 2 . 8 % of the total variance , consists of 5 items as rhythm , repetition , unity and order and number of the design elements . 4 . 2 Conﬁrmatory factor analysis of design creativity The three factor model was further tested for stability with the maximum like - lihood conﬁrmatory factor analysis using LISREL 8 . 8 ( Joreskog & Sorbom , Table 2 Summary of rotated factors Factor Items ( in decreasing loadings ) Eigen - value Var .

The goodness of ﬁt statistic based on the covariance matrix of the remaining items , was rather low ( goodness of ﬁt index ¼ 0 . 403 , adjusted goodness of ﬁt index ¼ 0 . 337 ) . As Kunnan ( 1998 ) claimed that if “other goodness of ﬁt ( GFI ) indices , gener - ally formulated to range in value 0 ( no model ﬁt ) to 1 . 0 ( perfect model ﬁt ) that should be consulted in addition to c 2 statistic include : comparative ﬁt index Table 3 Rotated factor matrix Factor 1 2 3 4 5 New 0 . 892 0 . 226 0 . 179 0 . 120 (cid:2) 0 . 264 Novel 0 . 872 0 . 233 0 . 199 0 . 163 (cid:2) 0 . 279 Unusual 0 . 854 0 . 224 0 . 119 0 . 159 (cid:2) 0 . 135 Unconventional 0 . 851 0 . 215 0 . 110 0 . 041 0 . 240 Unique 0 . 846 0 . 193 0 . 152 0 . 148 (cid:2) 0 . 059 Original 0 . 840 0 . 227 0 . 186 0 . 202 (cid:2) 0 . 099 Infrequent 0 . 834 0 . 257 0 . 169 0 . 075 0 . 164 Extraordinary 0 . 804 0 . 233 0 . 045 0 . 049 0 . 214 Diﬀerent 0 . 780 0 . 337 0 . 128 0 . 134 0 . 235 Eccentric 0 . 771 0 . 157 0 . 169 0 . 138 0 . 016 Appealed 0 . 641 0 . 371 0 . 206 0 . 594 (cid:2) 0 . 027 Delighted 0 . 626 0 . 384 0 . 216 0 . 604 (cid:2) 0 . 020 Exciting 0 . 609 0 . 448 0 . 177 0 . 300 0 . 097 Good 0 . 609 0 . 407 0 . 267 0 . 513 (cid:2) 0 . 033 Pleasant 0 . 596 0 . 394 0 . 233 0 . 529 (cid:2) 0 . 068 Shape 0 . 555 0 . 481 0 . 292 0 . 213 (cid:2) 0 . 055 Fresh 0 . 485 0 . 434 0 . 180 0 . 349 0 . 041 Zippy 0 . 421 0 . 420 0 . 175 0 . 371 0 . 129 Variety 0 . 415 0 . 332 (cid:2) 0 . 049 0 . 021 (cid:2) 0 . 086 Integrated 0 . 213 0 . 765 0 . 327 0 . 057 0 . 024 Polished 0 . 417 0 . 742 0 . 037 0 . 172 0 . 073 Reﬁned 0 . 407 0 . 735 0 . 198 0 . 173 0 . 037 Adequate 0 . 420 0 . 698 0 . 274 0 . 182 0 . 071 Deliberate 0 . 441 0 . 682 0 . 208 0 . 084 0 . 087 Geometric 0 . 153 0 . 666 0 . 312 0 . 141 (cid:2) 0 . 085 Detailed 0 . 446 0 . 660 0 . 235 0 . 170 0 . 036 Figure e ground 0 . 113 0 . 605 0 . 180 0 . 087 (cid:2) 0 . 048 Sensible 0 . 443 0 . 596 0 . 361 0 . 194 0 . 144 Balanced 0 . 014 0 . 550 0 . 403 0 . 116 (cid:2) 0 . 056 Coherent 0 . 256 0 . 536 0 . 501 0 . 093 0 . 046 Harmony 0 . 361 0 . 525 0 . 489 0 . 284 (cid:2) 0 . 029 Proportion 0 . 307 0 . 493 0 . 412 0 . 160 (cid:2) 0 . 116 Size 0 . 418 0 . 466 0 . 402 0 . 088 (cid:2) 0 . 026 Signiﬁcant 0 . 264 0 . 446 0 . 131 0 . 096 (cid:2) 0 . 018 Colour 0 . 364 0 . 371 0 . 235 0 . 274 (cid:2) 0 . 006 Rhythm 0 . 118 0 . 207 0 . 880 0 . 113 0 . 058 Repetition 0 . 159 0 . 160 0 . 675 0 . 151 0 . 087 Number 0 . 405 0 . 183 0 . 655 0 . 194 0 . 048 Unity (cid:2) 0 . 010 0 . 470 0 . 618 0 . 061 (cid:2) 0 . 043 Order 0 . 081 0 . 111 0 . 505 0 . 008 (cid:2) 0 . 174 Balance 0 . 009 0 . 219 0 . 293 (cid:2) 0 . 048 0 . 088 Extraction method : maximum likelihood .

Generally , if any of these indices are above 0 . 90 , the rule of thumb is that there is recommendation from the in - dices there is model ﬁt , pending examination of the c 2 statistic and model in - terpretability” ( p . 307 ) . An index value between 0 . 90 and 0 . 95 is acceptable and above 0 . 95 is good . The model proved acceptable based on the following sta - tistical tests including ; normed - ﬁt index ( NFI ) ¼ 0 . 92 , non - normed - ﬁt index ( NNFI ) ¼ 0 . 93 , parsimony normed - ﬁt index ( PNFI ) ¼ 0 . 87 , comparative ﬁt index ( CFI ) ¼ 0 . 94 , incremental ﬁt index ( IFI ) ¼ 0 . 94 , relative ﬁt index ( RFI ) ¼ 0 . 92 . Therefore , since NFI , NNFI , CFI and IFI are above 0 . 90 , it can be concluded that there is model ﬁt . Hatcher ( 1996 ) stated that for a model to provide an ideal ﬁt , the p value as - sociated with the model ﬁt c 2 test should exceed 0 . 05 and being closer to 1 . 00 is better . Since p < 0 . 001 in this model , it can be assumed that there is no ideal ﬁt for this study . But Saris , Satorra , and Sorbom ( 1987 ) found that the c 2 statistic is acceptable only for the large samples . The sample size in this study is 210 . Bentler and Chou ( 1987 ) suggested ﬁve subjects per item and Kunnan ( 1998 ) said “that sample sizes less than 150 may not ensure stable estimates or for that matter representativeness” ( p . 300 ) . Therefore , since the developed instrument having 41 items , 205 samples is the minimum amount recommen - ded for the application of the statistical techniques . The path diagram of the model can be seen in Figure 3 . The structural equation model is used for a plausible explanation of the rela - tions between the artifact creativity , the design elements and the assembly of design elements . The model shows how 41 items ( observed variables ) are re - lated to the 3 latent variables ( see Figure 3 ) . The artifact creativity ( exogenous variable ) has a high regression coeﬃcient ( g ¼ 0 . 85 ) of the design elements and there is a negative low regression coeﬃcient ( g ¼ (cid:2) 0 . 21 ) of the assembly of de - sign elements . The structural error term ( z ¼ 1 . 04 ) shows how the design ele - ments and the assembly of design elements share a common variation and the predictor relations in the model do not explain it . As seen in Figure 3 , the loadings ( l ) of the creativity elements range from 0 . 51 to 1 . 13 with the lowest being balance and the highest being original . The load - ings ( l ) of the design elements range from 0 . 78 to 1 . 08 with the lowest being colour and the highest being number . The loadings ( l ) of the assembly of de - sign elements range from 0 . 36 to 1 . 14 with the lowest being variety and the highest being rhythm . 4 . 3 Predictive validity of the design creativity rating scale Further analysis was done for testing the validity of the rating scale . The pre - dictive analysis was examined with the squared multiple correlation for each variable in the model . It is the percent variance explained for each variable . LIS - REL output gives the squared multiple correlations for each variable in Table 4 .

Among all the items , the lowest value belongs to balance in the assembly of design elements and followed by balanced in the artifact creativity . The corre - lation between the artifact creativity and the design elements is high ( r ¼ 0 . 848 ) and the artifact creativity and the assembly of design elements is medium ( r ¼ 0 . 673 ) . 5 Discussion 5 . 1 On the exploratory factor analysis Three factors were found by the exploratory factor analysis . Among 16 items of the ﬁrst factor , only one item belongs to the design elements and the others all belong to the artifact creativity ( Table 3 ) . The ﬁrst 10 items ranking from the highest to the lowest loadings are the ‘novelty characteristics’ of the arti - fact . These are namely new , novel , unusual , unconventional , unique , original , infrequent , extraordinary , diﬀerent and eccentric . “Novelty depicts that the quality of something being new and unusual for the student and at that level of education” ( Demirkan & Hasirci , 2009 , p . 298 ) . Then , the ﬁrst factor in - volves appealed , delighted , exciting , good and , pleasant characteristics of Table 4 Prediction of design creativity elements from squared multiple regression model R 2 e design elements ( des ) R 2 e assembly of design elements ( prin ) R 2 e artifact creativity ( cr ) 1 .

These items can be named as the ’aﬀective characteristics’ of the artifact and could be thought as feelings or mood associated with a particular artifact ( Olgunturk & Demirkan , 2011 ) . So , the artifact characteristic is pro - viding an aﬀective interaction with the assessor . This is not a cognitive inter - action as the novelty provides . Shape is the only design element that is associated with the aﬀective artifact characteristics . Therefore , factor 1 is named as the ‘novelty and aﬀective characteristics’ of the artifact ( Table 2 ) . Then , fresh , zippy and variety are listed ( Table 3 ) . These are not considered in the ﬁrst factor since they have lower than 0 . 50 loadings . The second factor involves 12 items . Among 12 , 9 items belong to the artifact creativity , 2 items to the design element and 1 to the assembly of design ele - ments ( Table 3 ) . The artifact creativity items are integrated , polished , reﬁned , adequate , deliberate , detailed , sensible , balanced and coherent . These charac - teristics involve the elaboration of the artifact . Therefore , it is named as ‘elab - oration characteristics’ of the artifact ( Table 2 ) . This factor can be explained as the variety of implications that a designer produces . The geometric relations of the elements and the ﬁgure e ground relations both provide and increase in the elaboration characteristics of the artifact . Harmony , also as a tool to assemble the design elements , adds to the elaboration value of the artifact . Following 3 design elements ( proportion , size and colour ) and 1 artifact creativity item ( sig - niﬁcant ) are not considered with their low loadings ( Table 3 ) . The third factor involves 5 items ( Table 3 ) . Among 5 , 4 items belong to the as - sembly of design elements and one item to the design elements . Rhythm , rep - etition , unity and order are the assembly of design elements and number belongs to the design elements . This factor is named as ‘design principles’ ( Table 2 ) . Empirical research on the product creativity mostly investigated creativity through the products that are the consequences of creative process ( Besemer , 1998 ; Hennessey , 1994 ; Christiaans & Venselaar , 2005 ; Dorst & Cross , 2001 ; Krueger & Cross , 2006 ) . Within the context of architectural de - sign process , self - perceived creativity as a measure of creativity was also exam - ined ( Casakin & Kreitler , 2008 ; Kreitler & Casakin , 2009 , 2010 ) . Fluency , ﬂexibility and overall creativity were found as the three indicators of architec - tural design process . Similar to this study , Horn and Salvendy ( 2009 ) tested the web - based evalua - tions of chairs and lamps . Their study resulted in three main product creativity factors as aﬀect , importance and novelty . In this study , the ﬁrst factor that is related to the creative design characteristics consists of the novelty and aﬀec - tive characteristics of the artifact . These characteristics are dependent on the cognitive and aﬀective perception of the human being who rates the artifact as an expert . This study complies with Horn and Salvendy’s ( 2009 ) study 274 Design Studies Vol 33 No . 3 May 2012 but it diﬀers by further highlighting that the design product ( artifact ) has cre - ative characteristics that depend on the cognitive and aﬀective perception of the person who assesses it . This study explores as a pioneer the relationship between creativity and design characteristics . Shape is found to be the only design element that belongs to the cognitive and aﬀective artifact characteristics . Shape was found to be the inter - nal design element with the highest loading ( 0 . 988 ) in Demirkan and Hasirci’s ( 2009 ) study . Since they examined independently each factor characteristic , the interaction of shape with the creative product characteristics was not found . In this study , the geometric relations of the elements , ﬁgure e ground relations and harmony provide and increase in the elaboration characteristics of the ar - tifact . Figure e ground relationship is the inter - dependence between the ele - ments of a design and the design ﬁeld . In designs , instead of a distinction between the foreground and background , an unbroken sequence of shape and colour is preferred ( Arnheim , 1969 ) . In Olgunturk and Demirkan’s ( 2011 ) study , this was achieved by the correspondence between positive and negative shapes until the ﬁgure and ground became integrated . In Demirkan and Hasirci’s ( 2009 ) study , the geometric relations of the elements and ﬁgure e ground relations were not considered , since they were not dominant in that speciﬁc artifact . Harmony was the most important characteristic in the assembly of design elements with the highest loading ( 0 . 891 ) . In this study , the third factor consists of rhythm , repetition , unity and order as the assembly of design elements and number as the design element . In Demirkan and Hasirci’s ( 2009 ) study , assembly of design elements was categorised in two parts as ‘integrity’ and ‘in parts’ . Rhythm was the third ( 0 . 841 ) , unity was the fourth ( 0 . 831 ) in rank in ‘integrity’ subcategory . Repetition was the second ( 0 . 805 ) in the ‘in parts’ subcategory . The exploratory maximum likelihood analysis helped to determine the relationship between creative design and de - sign characteristics . This study supports the phenomenon that creativity is a natural component of design process . 5 . 2 On the conﬁrmatory factor analysis of design creativity The squared multiple correlation between the artifact creativity and the design elements was high ( 0 . 848 ) and also between the artifact creativity and the as - sembly of design elements ( 0 . 673 ) . These ﬁndings comply with Hasirci and Demirkan’s ( 2007 ) study where the product creativity was highly correlated ( 0 . 882 ) with the design elements and also with the assembly of design elements ( 0 . 848 ) . The diﬀerence is that in their study each factor was tested independently . 6 Conclusion The objective of this study was to develop an instrument for measuring the cre - ativity of artifacts in design education . Creativity indicators as the items of the instrument were based on the review and appraisal of the literature on Assessing Creativity in design education 275 product / artifact creativity . This instrument was utilised for the assessment of 210 artifacts with satisfactory internal consistency . The results of factor anal - ysis indicated a reﬁned instrument with three factors ( 31 items ) . The ﬁndings indicated that as the instructors examine a design artifact , novelty and aﬀection characteristics provided by the design is the primary factor and it is associated with the shape of the design . As a second factor , the amount of elaboration presented in the artifact is important . The geometric relations of the elements and ﬁgure e ground relations both provide and increase in the elaboration characteristics of the artifact . Furthermore , harmony is a tool to assemble the design elements for elaboration of the artifact . In this factor , it is seen that elaboration is in interaction with design characteristics . Lastly , qualities of design as rhythm , repetition , unity and order aﬀect the instructor . So , a creative design is a matter of the elaboration and design elements assem - bly together rather than novelty and aﬀection alone . These three factors pro - vide a theoretical and methodological framework for the development of tools that augment the designer on creative assessment . Furthermore , the predictive validity of the assessment instrument was tested for each item . The corresponding values can be seen in detail in Table 4 . De - lighted in the artifact creativity , harmony in the assembly of design elements and shape in the design elements had the highest correlations . In addition , it was determined that the correlation between the artifact creativity and the de - sign elements was high ( r ¼ 0 . 848 ) where there was a medium correlation ( r ¼ 0 . 673 ) between the artifact creativity and the assembly of design elements . The three factor model was further tested for stability with the maximum like - lihood conﬁrmatory analysis and it was found that the model was ﬁt . The con - ﬁrmatory factor analysis helped to analyse each item in depth . The corresponding loadings of each item within each factor were identiﬁed . Orig - inality in the artifact creativity , number in the design elements and rhythm in the assembly of design elements had the highest loadings in the structural equation model ( Figure 3 ) . It is important to note that the factor loadings derived for the conﬁrmatory factor analysis and the structural equation model are speciﬁc to the current sample and may partially have been impacted by the artifacts . This study is a pioneer in design education to the best knowledge of the authors . Therefore , it is expected the conﬁrmatory factor analysis and the structural equation model’s latent variables to operate in a similar fashion in other studies .
