The purpose of this study was to develop an Internet attitude scale for high school students . Through both revising a previous scale proposed by Selwyn ( 1997 ) [ Selwyn , N . ( 1997 ) . Students’ attitudes toward computers : vali - dation of a computer attitude scale for 16 – 19 education . Computers & Education , 28 ( 1 ) , 35 – 41 ] and writing new items , this study developed an Internet Attitude Scale of 18 items , with the following four subscales : perceived usefulness , aﬀection , perceived control , and behavior . This study also explored gender diﬀerences on the scale , and the relationship between Internet experience and students’ responses on the scale . Research data gathered from 753 Taiwan high school students revealed that students of diﬀerent gender and various Internet experiences did not show statistical diﬀerences on the perceptions toward the poten - tial usefulness of the Internet subscale . However , male students tended to express more positive feeling , lower anxiety , and higher conﬁdence toward using the Internet than female students . Students having more Internet experience tended to show similar positive attitudes than those of less experience . # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd . All rights reserved .

Introduction Over the last few years , Internet technology has rapidly and dramatically inﬂuenced not only the manner of human communication , but also the mediation of teaching and learning ( Havick , 2000 ; Tsai , 2000 ) . Many researchers began to notice and to explore the unique features of the Internet . For example , Wagner and Wagner ( 1997 ) characterized the Internet by its dynamic 0360 - 1315 / 01 / $ - see front matter # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd . All rights reserved .

Tsai ) . nature , breadth of available resources , and the ease of getting information . Others attempted to put Internet literacy into the deﬁnition of computer literacy ( Turner , Sweany , & Husman , 2000 ) . In contemporary and future societies , it is clear that Internet literacy plays and will play an essential role for all citizens to become information literate and lifelong learners . Preparing stu - dents for the knowledge and skills of Internet applications has also been recognized as an important goal of computer literacy education in the school curriculum ( International Technol - ogy Education Association , 1996 ) . Just as the role of computer attitude is deﬁned in computer literacy ( e . g . Tsai , 1999 ) , Internet attitude should be regarded as a component of Internet literacy . Students’ attitudes towards the Internet may inﬂuence their motivation and interests towards learning to use the Internet , or vice versa ( Coﬃn & MacIntyre , 1999 ) . As previous literature has suggested that students’ attitudes toward computers have interactions with their performance of using and learning computers ( e . g . Houle , 1996 ) , students’ Internet attitudes may also have interactions with students’ performance in employing Internet technology . Moreover , female and male students may have diﬀerent atti - tudes towards the Internet , including usefulness , aﬀection , and behaviors . Although there are several scales of measuring students’ computer attitudes developed by educators ( e . g . Francis , Katz , & Jones , 2000 ; Selwyn , 1997 ) , due to the unique characteristics of the Internet , which are diﬀerent from computers that work alone ( for example , information sharing and interactive communication ) , the above comments and hypotheses need to be further investigated and explored . However , if an instrument for measuring Internet attitudes is not available , these research questions will not be answered . The Internet has been recognized as producing the 4th industrial revolution in human history ( Capron , 1999 ) . In the twenty - ﬁrst century , citizen’s attitudes toward using and learning the Internet may determine the educational and economical development of a society . Students’ Internet attitudes may impact their future involvement in Internet - related careers or activities . Assessing students’ Internet attitudes with validity and reliability is necessary for future Internet - related research . Most existing computer attitude scales are no longer as relevant to today’s stu - dents who have grown up in an Internet - saturated society . Therefore , the purpose of this study was to develop the Internet Attitude Scale ( IAS ) by both revising a previous computer attitude scale and adding new items . Variables including gender and Internet using experiences were also analyzed in this study . 2 . The development of the IAS To develop the Internet Attitude Scale ( IAS ) , a pool of items was collected by mainly adapting items from Selwyn’s ( 1997 ) computer attitude scale and writing new items . Selwyn proposed the following four subscales for computer attitudes : aﬀection , perceived usefulness , perceived control and behavior , including a total of 21 items . The items developed in this study were mainly based upon these items , and this study changed the term ‘‘computers’’ in the scale items into ‘‘the Internet . ’’ For example , the item ‘‘Computers make me feel uncomfortable’’ was reworded into ‘‘The Internet makes me feel uncomfortable . ’’ Besides , the authors developed 11 additional items for the initial pool of items . These items were included after consulting with some experts in Internet technology and technology education . Many of these new items were statements 42 C . - C . Tsai et al . / Computers & Education 37 ( 2001 ) 41 – 51 addressing the special features of Internet . For example , the items like ‘‘The Internet enlarges my scope’’ and ‘‘The Internet helps me acquire relevant information I need’’ focused on the function of worldwide connections and information sharing provided by the Internet . As a result , the initial pool of items in the scale included a total of 32 items . These 32 items were then presented using a four - point Likert scale ( from ‘‘strongly agree , ’’ ‘‘agree , ’’ ‘‘disagree’’ to ‘‘strongly dis - agree’’ ) to a group of Taiwan high school students for item analysis . 1 All of the items were pre - sented in Chinese . The translation between English and Chinese in this study was completed by one of the authors , and the rest of the authors validated the translation . Approximately 1000 Taiwan high school students were selected as the participants of this study using cluster sampling . The population of high school students in Taiwan was clustered into three demographic areas : northern , central , and southern Taiwan . Eight schools were selected from the three areas . For each school , two to three classes were randomly selected to form the initial sub - ject pool , i . e . of about 900 students . However , if a subject had never used the Internet , their data were excluded from further statistic analyses . This left 753 subjects in the ﬁnal sample pool . The research data gathered from these students were used to explore their Internet attitudes , Internet dependence and some other related variables and the ﬁndings will be reported in a series of papers ( e . g . Lin & Tsai , in press ) . The focus of this paper is to report on one aspect of this research , the development of the Internet attitude scale . Since there were more male students that had experi - ences of using the Internet , the ﬁnal sample was about 67 . 5 % male . The evidence that more males than females used the Internet corresponds to Internet usage research conducted worldwide ( e . g . Griﬃths , 1998 ) . For students’ non - responses , unintentional skips or unidentiﬁable marks on some items of the initial version of IAS , this study processed these as ‘‘missing’’ data . Hence , the valid number of student cases on each item or subscale of the attitude measurement varied . However , the ‘‘miss - ing’’ data for any item or subscale , at most , counted for 3 % of the whole data set . Factor analysis was then used on the data for item analysis . Selwyn ( 1997 ) used exploratory factor analysis , principle component analysis with varimax rotation , to clarify the structure of computer attitude scale . Subjects’ attitudes towards computer can be distinctively grouped into four orthogonal factors , aﬀective , perceived usefulness , perceived control , and behavioral com - ponents that accounted for 64 . 8 % of total variance explained . Therefore , this study applied the same factor analysis method to deal with the current data set . 2 The eigenvalues of the ﬁrst four factors from principle component analysis were larger than one : 3 . 358 , 2 . 607 , 2 . 254 , and 1 . 466 ( Table 1 ) . 1 Item stated in a reverse way was scored in a reverse way , described later . 2 One may argue that Internet attitudes and computer attitudes are diﬀerent psychological phenomenon , then scale development for a new Internet attitude scale should begin with exploratory work identifying the key features of such attitudes . Internet surely has its distinctive features but in designing this scale , only the attitudes highly related with learning outcomes are addressed . In a longitudinal study , Klobas and Clyde ( 2000 ) investigated how attitudes asso - ciated with Internet learning . They found adults viewed Internet as a useful , interesting , relative advantage tool to get learning information and communicate with learning partners . Also , Internet attitudes , such as perceived usefulness , perceived control , intention of using Internet , and low anxiety were related to positive learning behaviors . Because this study was pilot in nature , the authors decided to limit the research scope on Internet attitudes concerning learning while other attitude factors concerning communication or social interaction — such as deindividualization in Joinson ( 1998 ) or ﬂaming in Thompsen and Fulger ( 1996 ) — are not included in this study . Based on this reﬂection , we assumed the Internet attitude scale is composed of similar factor structure of computer attitude scale designed by Sel - C . - C . Tsai et al . / Computers & Education 37 ( 2001 ) 41 – 51 43 Only four factors were retained in the ﬁnal version of the scale and they accounted for 53 . 81 % of variance . An item was retained only when it loaded greater than (cid:1) 0 . 40 on the relevant factor and less than (cid:1) 0 . 40 on non - relevant factor . Thus , the initial 32 items were reduced to 18 items . The retained items and responding subscales are shown in Table 2 . A detailed description of the four subscales is presented below : 1 . The perceived usefulness subscale : measuring students’ perceptions about the positive impacts of the Internet on individuals and society . 2 . The aﬀection subscale : assessing students’ feeling and anxiety when using the Internet . 3 . The perceived control subscale : measuring students’ conﬁdence about the independent control of the usage of the Internet . 4 . The behavior subscale : assessing students’ actual practice and frequency of using the Internet . The internal reliability index , alpha coeﬃcients , were adequate for the ﬁrst three subscales , 0 . 82 , 0 . 71 , and 0 . 68 , and for the entire scale , 0 . 81 . However , alpha ( 0 . 49 ) was relatively low for the fourth scale , Internet use behavior . The poor internal consistency of the behavior subscale Table 1 Rotated factor loadings and Cronbach’s (cid:1) values for the four factors ( subscales ) of the Internet Attitude Scale a Item Factor 1 : Perceived usefulness Factor 2 : Aﬀection Factor 3 : Perceived control Factor 4 : Behavior Factor 1 : Perceived usefulness a = 0 . 82 14 0 . 640 22 0 . 727 26 0 . 752 30 0 . 749 32 0 . 780 Factor 2 : Aﬀection a = 0 . 71 5 0 . 649 17 0 . 701 21 0 . 657 25 0 . 588 29 0 . 625 Factor 3 : Perceived control a = 0 . 68 3 0 . 476 15 0 . 610 19 0 . 573 23 0 . 691 27 0 . 763 Factor 4 : Behavior a = 0 . 49 8 0 . 681 16 0 . 687 20 0 . 619 Eigen value 3 . 358 2 . 607 2 . 254 1 . 466 % Of variance 18 . 66 14 . 48 12 . 52 8 . 15 a Overall (cid:1) = 0 . 81 , total variance explained is 53 . 81 % . 44 C . - C . Tsai et al . / Computers & Education 37 ( 2001 ) 41 – 51 may be caused by the relative small number of items ( three items ) in the scale . Or , maybe the wording of those statements needs further modiﬁcation . Table 3 further showed the inter - corre - lation matrix among four subscales . Because all the correlations reached signiﬁcant level of 0 . 01 , the four factors measure Internet attitude in a coherent way . Table 2 shows that some items in the IAS were scored in a reverse manner . In this way , stu - dents having higher scores on the scale showed better attitudes and higher conﬁdence toward Table 2 Retained items on the Internet Attitude Scale Item No . a Subscale Question 14 Perceived usefulness The Internet can allow me to do more interesting and imaginative work 22 Perceived usefulness The Internet enlarges my scope b 26 Perceived usefulness The Internet makes a great contribution to human life b 30 Perceived usefulness The Internet helps me acquire relevant information I need b 32 Perceived usefulness The Internet makes society more advanced b 5 Aﬀection I hesitate to use the Internet in case I look stupid c 17 Aﬀection If given the opportunity to use the Internet I am afraid that I might damage it in some way c 21 Aﬀection The Internet makes me feel uncomfortable c 25 Aﬀection I feel bored toward using the Internet b , c 29 Aﬀection When using the Internet , I am not quite conﬁdent about what I am doing b , c 3 Perceived control I could probably teach myself most of the things I need to know about the Internet 15 Perceived control I need an experienced person nearby when I use the Internet c 19 Perceived control If I get problems using the Internet , I can usually solve them one way or the other 23 Perceived control I do not need someone to tell me the best way to use the Internet 27 Perceived control I can use the Internet independently , without the assistance of others b 8 Behavior I only use the Internet at schools when told to c 16 Behavior I use the Internet regularly throughout school 20 Behavior I spend much time on using the Internet b a The item number indicates the item order in the initial version of the IAS ( a total of 32 items ) . b Not modiﬁed from Selwyn’s ( 1997 ) scale . c Scored in a reverse way Table 3 Inter - correlation matrix of four Internet attitude factors Internet Attitude Factors Perceived usefulness Aﬀection Perceived control Behavior Perceived usefulness – Aﬀection 0 . 407 * * – Perceived control 0 . 279 * * 0 . 287 * * – Behavior 0 . 260 * * 0 . 197 * * 0 . 406 * * – * * P < 0 . 01 .

However , it should be noted that the ﬁnal scale of 18 items was not completely balanced for direction of answering ( e . g . only seven of the 18 items were stated in a reverse way ) . 3 . Students’ scores on the Scale Table 4 further presents students’ average total scores and standard deviations on the four subscales . A further examination about mean diﬀerences among four subscales is presented in Table 5 . Students scored highest on the perceived usefulness subscale ( an average of 3 . 38 per item , i . e . 16 . 90 / 5 ) and followed by the aﬀection subscale ( an average of 3 . 19 per item ) , the perceived control subscale ( an average of 2 . 62 per item ) , and the behavior subscale ( an average of 2 . 53 per item , i . e . 7 . 59 / 3 ) . These results imply that students , in general , tended to appreciate the potential usefulness and show positive feeling in using the Internet . The relatively lower scores on the per - ceived control and behavior subscales suggest that some of the students might have had either real or perceived diﬃculties in controlling the Internet . This is the classic ’lost in cyberspace’ feeling that has been documented in hypermedia studies . 4 . Gender diﬀerences on the scale This study further compared male and female students’ scores on the four subscales of the IAS . The results of t - tests are presented in Table 6 . Table 6 reveals that male and female students’ scores on the perceived usefulness subscale did not show statistical diﬀerences at the 0 . 05 Table 4 Students’ scores on the subscales of Iinternet Attitude Scale Subscale Items Possible range Range ( actual ) Mean S .

That is , both male and female students perceived similar levels of usefulness of the Internet , and their high scores suggested that both male and female students believed in the potential usefulness of Internet . However , on the aﬀection , perceived control , and behavior sub - scales , male students expressed statistically more positive attitudes towards the Internet than female students did . In other words , male students showed lower anxiety and higher conﬁdence when using the Internet than female students did . Male students were also likely to use the Internet more frequently than female students . 3 5 . Internet experience and Internet attitudes This study , moreover , analyzed the relationships between students’ Internet attitudes and their Internet experience . Internet experience deﬁned in this study is the length of time from the time of the student’s ﬁrst usage of the Internet to that of answering the IAS . This study divided the sample students into ﬁve groups of diﬀerent levels of Internet experience : less than 1 year , 1 – 2 years , 2 – 3 years , 3 – 4 years , and ﬁnally more than 4 years . 4 In the sample , about 42 % of the stu - dents had used the Internet for less than 1 year , 36 % for 1 – 2 years , 15 % for 2 – 3 years , 5 % for 3 – 4 years , and 2 % for more than 4 years . Table 7 shows an analysis between diﬀerent Internet experience groups and their Internet attitudes . The ANOVA tests revealed that Internet experi - ence played a role on IAS’s subscales of aﬀection , perceived control and behavior . However , students of various Internet experiences did not express signiﬁcantly diﬀerent perceptions about the potential usefulness of Internet . Through a series of Scheﬀe tests ( Post Hoc tests ) , it was found that students having a longer time of exposure to the Internet tended to have statistically higher scores on the aﬀection , perceived control and behavior subscales .

In fact , the authors tried to ask students to report their weekly Internet usage when developing the scale ; however , some students responded invalid estimation ( e . g . more than 100 hours a week ) . Hence , the authors decided to use their time of ﬁrst usage to represent their Internet experience . C . - C . Tsai et al . / Computers & Education 37 ( 2001 ) 41 – 51 47 ( 2000 ) proposed that the construct validity of computer attitude scales could be demonstrated by a ( positive ) correlation to previous computer - related experiences . Thus , the signiﬁcant relation - ships between students’ Internet experiences and many subscales of the IAS in this study may provide evidence about the construct validity of the IAS . These relationships indicated that stu - dents having more Internet experience tended to express more positive feeling , lower anxiety , and higher conﬁdence when using the Internet . Especially , the Scheﬀe tests indicated that Internet experience was highly related to students’ perceptions of independent control of using the Inter - net . Increased Internet experience may greatly help students build conﬁdence towards using the Internet . It is also plausible to ﬁnd that students’ Internet experience was positively related to their actual practice and frequency of using the Internet ( i . e . the behavior subscale ) . Both the gender comparisons and Internet experience comparisons revealed that students of diﬀerent gender and various Internet experiences did not show statistical diﬀerences on the per - ceived usefulness subscale , but they did display signiﬁcant diﬀerences on the rest of the three subscales . Students’ perceptions about the usefulness of the Internet may be independent of their gender and Internet experiences . 6 . Discussion The results of this study revealed that male students , in many subscales , had more positive Internet attitudes than female students . The functions and features of the Internet are diﬀerent from computers that work alone without connections ; however , similar phenomena existed in terms of gender diﬀerence in attitudes toward these media and technologies . Although some researchers have argued that females’ computer attitudes varied with age in terms of comfort , eﬃcacy , and control over computers ( Czaja & Sharit , 1998 ; Levin & Gordon , 1989 ) , previous research concerning gender diﬀerence in computer - related attitudes , in general , has shown that male students had more positive attitudes towards computers — including anxiety , conﬁdence , and liking — than female students ( AlJabri , 1996 ; Robertson , Calder , Fung , Jones , & O’Shea , Table 7 An analysis of Internet experiences and Internet attitudes Internet experiences Perceived usefulness ( mean , S .

Tsai et al . / Computers & Education 37 ( 2001 ) 41 – 51 1995 ) . This study provided essential parallel evidence when research shifted the focus of analyses from computer attitudes to Internet attitudes . This study further suggests that the gender diﬀer - ences in Internet attitudes may exist as early as in the high school stage . However , the ﬁndings of this study revealed that both male and female students held similar perceptions about the use - fulness of Internet . Users’ prior computer experience , especially the time of exposure , was another variable the computer - related research has paid much attention to . The impact of Internet experience on stu - dents’ Internet attitudes revealed by this study was parallel to the impact of computer experiences on students’ attitudes toward computers found in the research literature ( e . g . Houle , 1996 ; Levin & Gordon , 1989 ; Smith , Caputi , & Rawstorne , 2000 ) . Students with longer Internet exposure time , in general , had more positive attitudes toward the Internet . Czaja and Sharit ( 1998 ) even claimed that , both males and females , increased experiences with computers resulted in more positive attitudes for all people across most attitude dimensions . They further asserted that computer attitudes are modiﬁable for people of all age groups and the nature of computer experiences had an impact on attitude change . The present study indicated that students’ prior Internet experience played an important role on their Internet attitudes , and providing appro - priate Internet experiences may be a useful way to change students’ Internet attitudes in a more satisfactory direction . The ﬁndings derived from this study suggested that Internet experience was positively related to students’ aﬀection , perceived control and behavior of using the Internet . Increased positive Internet experiences may help students shape better attitudes towards the Internet , especially for those who showed high anxiety and low conﬁdence in using the Internet . In summary , ﬁndings derived from this study mostly paralleled what had been found in prior computer - related attitude research . Male students showed more positive Internet attitudes than female students did ; and , students with more Internet experiences tended to have better Internet attitudes . Since the Internet will be one of the main technologies surrounding all people’s future life and learning environment , and people’s attitudes do aﬀect their technology utilization ( AlKhaldi & AlJabri , 1998 ) , measuring Internet attitudes with validity and reliability is an important issue in Internet - related research . This study could be viewed as one of the beginning attempts on this . The next step of this study should work on providing more strong evidence about the validity of the IAS scale or making further modiﬁcation . For instance , new items may be necessary to improve the consistency of the behavior subscale . In addition , this pilot study applied exploratory factor analysis to verify the structure of a new Internet attitude scale . We encourage future study to use conﬁrmatory factor analysis approach ( Bentler & Bonett , 1980 ; Joreskog & Sorbom , 1988 ; Rainer & Miller , 1996 ; Valois et al . , 2000 ) to further examine the validity and reliability of the newly developed Internet scale . Some issues also need more research to reach ﬁnal conclusion , such as whether Internet attitude can be best described by a higher order or ﬁrst order model and factors were correlated or orthogonal . Since the scale developed in this study was conducted in Chinese ( though many items were modiﬁed from a relevant English - based version ) , researchers of diﬀerent language and cultural backgrounds are encouraged to adapt the scale to further examine its reliability and validity and then conduct some comparative analyses . Brosnan and Lee ( 1998 ) have reported a cultural dif - ference between the West and the East college students concerning gender diﬀerences in computer attitudes and anxieties . Similar attempts about students’ Internet attitudes can be conducted in the future . Future study should also develop some other attitude subscales that respond to the C . - C . Tsai et al . / Computers & Education 37 ( 2001 ) 41 – 51 49 unique features of the Internet , for instance , attitudes towards social - oriented online interactions and anonymous letters on the Internet . A careful exploration of students’ attitudes in these areas may provide more insights into how the use of the Internet is perceived and practiced by students .
