The unique biology and phylogenetic position of Dictyostelium offer a great opportunity to gain knowledge of processes not char - acterized in other organisms . The recent completion 15 of the 34 MB genome sequence , together with the sizable scientific literature using Dictyostelium as a research organism , provided the necessary tools to create a well - annotated genome . dictyBase has lever - aged software developed by the Saccharomyces 20 Genome Database and the Generic Model Organism Database project . This has reduced the time required to develop a full - featured MOD and greatly facilitated our ability to focus on annotation and providing new functionality . We hope that manual curation of the 25 Dictyostelium genome will facilitate the annotation of other genomes . INTRODUCTION dictyBase ( http : / / dictybase . org ) is the model organism data - base ( MOD ) for the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum . 30 Like other MODs such as FlyBase ( 1 ) , WormBase ( 2 , 3 ) , Mouse Genome Informatics ( 4 ) and the Saccharomyces Gen - ome Database ( SGD ) ( 5 ) , dictyBase ( 6 ) uses the organism’s genome sequence to organize the biological knowledge resulting from experimental studies using Dictyostelium . 35 Dictyostelium is a model organism widely used for biomedical research . An amoeba during most of its life , starvation induces a very interesting developmental program during which indi - vidual cells stream together by chemotaxis to form a multi - cellular tissue ( 7 ) . A morphogenetic process involving cell 40 migration and cellular morphogenesis transforms a simple mound of cells into a slug or pseudoplasmodium establishing a relatively simple developmental pattern . This structure then develops into a fruiting body consisting of multiple cell types including spores and terminally differentiated stalk cells . 45 These features together with the efﬁcient genetic manipulation by gene targeting and replacement as well as insertional muta - genesis and suppressor screens have made Dictyostelium a popular experimental system . Research using Dictyostelium has been critical in understanding fundamental processes such 50 as cell migration ( 8 ) , cell signaling ( 9 , 10 ) , phagocytosis and morphogenesis . Recently Dictyostelium has also been used to help establish the mechanisms of action of medically import - ant drugs such as cisplatin ( 11 – 14 ) , used to treat various can - cers , and lithium and valproic acid ( 15 ) , used to treat 55 depressive disorders . The recently completed Dictyostelium genome sequence is housed at dictyBase and has been integ - rated with other experimental data to provide investigators with a rich new resource that will facilitate future studies using Dictyostelium experimentally and for comparative 60 genomics . GENOME SEQUENCE COMPLETED In May 2005 the sequence of the complete genome of Dicty - ostelium was reported ( 16 ) . The A + T rich genome ( 77 . 6 % ) consists of 34 million bases of DNA sequence that are pre - 65 dicted to encode 13 573 genes—a number of genes compar - able with Drosophila . dictyBase houses and maintains the genome sequence produced by the International Sequencing Consortium . As the ﬁrst free living protozoan to be completely sequenced , the predicted proteome supports the hypothesis 70 that Dictyostelium represents an early branch in the Eukaryotic Tree of Life that diverged after the split between animals , plants and fungi , with Dictyostelium and other amoebae more closely related to animals . Many Dictyostelium proteins are more similar to human orthologs than are those of 75 Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The genome has several notable features . The sequence is very gene dense with an average gene spacing of 2 . 5 kb . The abundance of short sequence * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

These amino acid repeats occur in > 2000 of the predicted proteins . The genome also contains a surprisingly large num - 5 ber of polyketide synthases , which may produce a previously unanticipated large complement of natural products . Consist - ent with this apparently large secondary metabolism , the gen - ome contains many ABC transporters that may be involved in export of these natural products . Also encoded are a large 10 number of proteins containing multiple EGF repeats that have been postulated to play roles in adhesion or cell recognition . These fascinating genomic features together with the unique biology of Dictyostelium and the rich body of Dictyostelium 15 literature ( nearly 8000 publications ) provide a valuable oppor - tunity to annotate many of the genes with functional informa - tion that will widen the spectrum of characterized proteins in public databases . This emphasizes the need for a well - curated database for Dictyostelium —a need . that dictyBase strives to 20 fulﬁll . dictyBase LINKS GENOME SEQUENCE TO FUNCTIONAL INFORMATION As the MOD for D . discoideum , dictyBase provides highly curated information that facilitates research by providing a 25 searchable , structured repository of Dictyostelium experi - mental results . In addition to the complete genome sequence , groups performing high - throughput experiments such as large - scale mutagenesis and microarray - based gene expression stud - ies are depositing their data in dictyBase for integration and 30 distribution to the research community . dictyBase uses the genomic DNA sequence as a scaffold on which to organize and display the biological knowledge and experimental evidence derived from Dictyostelium research . dictyBase is the most comprehensive source of information regarding 35 Dictyostelium , and the database presents the highest quality annotations of Dictyostelium genes . Table 1 presents the data content of dictyBase as of September 2005 . Nearly all of the data in dictyBase is available for bulk download through our download center ( http : / / dictybase . org / downloads / ) . 40 The heart of dictyBase is the Gene Page . A Gene Page is available for each gene that has been shown or predicted to exist in the genome . The Gene Page collects and organizes all of the available information related to that gene into several sections . Figure 1 shows an example of a typical Gene Page . A 45 General Information section provides the ofﬁcial gene name together with any other names that have been used to refer to that gene . This assures that a search of the database will allow retrieval of a gene using any name that has been used to refer to that gene . Scientiﬁc curators verify published 50 and proposed gene names to encourage use of the Dictyostelium Nomenclature Guidelines ( http : / / dictybase . org / nomenclatureguidelines . htm ) and to ensure that names are not duplicated . When appropriate , curators communicate with authors to discuss and modify gene names . Also in this section , 55 gene product names and a brief description of the gene product are presented , as is the unique dictyBaseID . Next , the Chro - mosomal Coordinates section presents a graphical view of the gene and associated sequences such as expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) , cDNAs and other GenBank entries . An Associ - 60 ated Sequences section provides links to sequences corres - ponding to each of the sequence features known for that gene , including gene predictions as well as ESTs , cDNAs and genomic sequences submitted by individual researchers to other public databases . The Protein Information section 65 contains the size , molecular weight and protein domains of the predicted protein . Functional information is presented in sections for Gene Ontology ( GO ) annotations and phenotypes whenever this information is available . Phenotypic data is represented 70 using a restricted vocabulary that describes the consequences of mutations reported for that gene . The Gene Ontology sec - tion lists terms from each of the function , process and com - ponent ontologies associated with the gene ( 17 , 18 ) . Following links in each of these sections display additional details for 75 these annotations . Clicking on a GO term or a phenotype will list all of the other genes annotated with the same term . The Expression section leads to developmental proﬁles for the gene that have been generated by large - scale microarray based studies performed at the Baylor College of Medicine 80 and the University of California , San Diego . The Links section on the Gene Page provides links to GenBank , UniProt , GeneDB at the Sanger Institute and , where appropriate , to signaling pathways at the Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment at Science ( 19 , 20 ) . This section also links to 85 researchers in our colleague database who are investigating that gene or gene product . A Literature Section lists the most recent publications referring to the gene and a link to a Lit - erature Guide that contains a complete listing of papers rel - evant to that gene . As of the fall of 2005 , > 500 Gene Pages had 90 a Summary paragraph written by a dictyBase curator that contains the current knowledge regarding that gene . dictyBase curators are in the process of manually reviewing all of the automated gene predictions in light of available data such as ESTs and cDNAs . Manually reviewed genes are indicated by 95 the presence of a ‘Curated Model’ on the Gene Page . As of September 2005 dictyBase curators have reviewed nearly 2500 genes , which corresponds to (cid:1) 20 % of the total number of genes . Table 1 .

Nucleic Acids Research , 2006 , Vol . 34 , Database issue D425 GENERAL RESOURCES FOR DICTYOSTELIUM dictyBase also serves as a clearinghouse for resource materials for students , researchers and educators using Dictyostelium in a wide range of classroom and laboratory settings . We main - 5 tain archives of the dictyNews , a weekly electronic newsletter that presents abstracts of papers available upon acceptance for publication , as well as a growing collection of protocols for working with Dictyostelium . DICTY STOCK CENTER ( DSC ) 10 dictyBase also provides a direct portal to the DSC maintained at Columbia University . This resource provides access to Dictyostelium strains , including natural isolates , targeted mutants and GFP labeled strains . The collection also contains plasmids used to manipulate gene expression or create targeted 15 gene disruptions . Currently the DSC has > 700 strains and > 150 plasmids all available to researchers . A shopping cart system allows Stock Center users to add strains and proceed to a checkout system familiar to any user of online ordering sys - tems . For users who are also registered as colleagues in the 20 dictyBase colleagues database , addresses for delivery and con - tact information are populated directly from the database . dictyBase holds all of the Stock Center data and provides the informatics support for the DSC . This will enable increased integration between gene information and strains 25 available through the DSC . DICTYBASE INCORPORATES SOFTWARE DEVELOPED BY OTHER MODS AND THE GENERIC MODEL ORGANISM DATABASE ( GMOD ) PROJECT 30 dictyBase was initially established as a clone of the software developed and generously provided by SGD . dictyBase developers have subsequently integrated several software packages from the GMOD project ( http : / / gmod . org ) . These include the GBrowse tool for chromosome and map displays 35 and , most recently , the Chado database schema for storing sequence and sequence feature information . This entailed port - ing of the Chado schema to Oracle since both dictyBase and SGD are implemented in Oracle . dictyBase has developed new code that separates communication with the database from 40 code that generates the HTML interfaces . This object layer facilitated adoption of the Chado schema without signiﬁcant impact on the presentation interface and enables good software practices such as unit testing . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS 45 dictyBase strives to present a comprehensive , reliable , care - fully curated dataset that integrates sequences , functional annotation , phenotypes , expression data and the research lit - erature , while retaining the ﬂexibility to integrate new data types as they become available . Our goal is to assure that the 50 information in dictyBase is accessible in an effective and intuitive interface useful for biologists , while also max - imizing its utility for the bioinformatics community to use computationally . Our operating principles are to respond to users’ needs , to capitalize on the vast efforts of the 55 Dictyostelium research community , and to provide an import - ant link in the network of MODs . As additional amoebae genome sequences become available dictyBase hopes to implement , and where necessary , develop interfaces and tools that facilitate comparative genomics of this diverse 60 group of organisms .
