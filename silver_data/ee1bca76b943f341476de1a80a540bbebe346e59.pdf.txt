Thrasher Regulated migration and spatial localiza - tion of dendritic cells ( DCs ) are critical events during the initiation of physiologic immune responses and maintenance of tolerance . Here we have used cells deﬁ - cient in the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASp ) to demonstrate the impor - tance of dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton for these trafﬁcking pro - cesses to occur in vitro and in vivo . On ﬁbronectin - coated surfaces , WASp - null immature murine DCs exhibited defects both of attachment and detachment , re - sulting in impaired net translocation com - pared with normal cells . The chemoki - netic response to CCL21 , which is critical for normal lymphatic trafﬁcking , was also abrogated in the absence of WASp . In vivo in both ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) and oxazolone contact hypersensi - tivity models , WASp - null Langerhans cell ( LC ) migration was compromised , as judged by exit from the skin as well as by homing to the draining lymph node ( LN ) . Furthermore , following systemic chal - lenge with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) or toxoplasma - derived antigen , WASp - null DCs showed incomplete redistribution to T - cell areas in the spleen . Instead , they were retained ectopically in the marginal zone . DC trafﬁcking in vivo is therefore dependent on a normally regulated actin cytoskeleton , which performs an essen - tial function during maintenance of physi - ologic immunity and when disturbed may contribute signiﬁcantly to the immunopa - thology of Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome . ( Blood . 2005 ; 105 : 1590 - 1597 ) © 2005 by TheAmerican Society of Hematology Introduction Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are highly motile bone marrow – derived antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) . They have specialized migratory and homing properties that allow them both to initiate primary immune responses and to induce tolerance . 1 , 2 In lymphoid organs they are present as interdigitating cells in the white pulp of the spleen and in the paracortex of lymph nodes ( LNs ) where they are able to capture incoming foreign antigen from blood or lymph , respectively . In nonlymphoid tissues DCs act as sentinels of injury and patrol for the presence of foreign antigens and pathogens . Upon capture they migrate to draining secondary lymphoid tissue during which time they mature and develop the capacity to stimulate antigen speciﬁc T cells . The migration and spatial localization of DCs are controlled by numerous extrinsic factors , including chemokine family members to which they are responsive through maturation and localization - dependent mechanisms . 3 - 7 The physical motility of cells and anchorage in speciﬁc tissues is , however , ultimately dependent on the regulated dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton , which determines the response of cells to chemokine gradients and enables purposeful movement through the sequential process of leading - edge protrusion , attachment , and tail retraction . 8 The molecular control of this highly coordinated activity is orchestrated by Rho family guanosine triphosphatases ( GTPases ) , the best characterized of which are Cdc42 , Rac1 / 2 , and RhoA , and their downstream effectors . 9 In hematopoietic cells , a key effector for Cdc42 is the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASp ) . WASp is a 502 – amino acid member of a conserved family of proteins that participate in the organization of actin polymerization primarily through activation of the actin - related protein ( Arp2 / Arp3 ) complex . 10 - 12 Interference in these signaling pathways results in multiple cytoskeletal defects in DCs , including the failure to form normal membrane projections and special - ized structures known as podosomes , which form behind the leading edge of motile cells . 13 - 16 Podosomes concentrate (cid:1) 2 integrins around an actincoreand , althoughtheirfunctionhasnotbeenclearlyidentiﬁed , are responsible for tight adhesion of cells to intercellular adhesion mole - cule - 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) and possibly junctional adhesion molecule - A ( JAM - A ) . 17 - 19 Furthermore , they are highly dynamic with a turnover of minutes , providing a migrating cell with a mechanism for rapid attachment and detachment , and with localized anchorage points that could facilitate traverse of endothelial barriers in particular . Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) is characterized by microthrom - bocytopenia , immunodeﬁciency , eczema , and autoimmunity . 12 The pathophysiology of WAS relates to defective polymerization of From the Molecular Immunology Unit , Institute of Child Health , London , United Kingdom ; the Immunobiology Unit , Institute of Child Health , London , United Kingdom ; the Immunobiology Laboratory , Cancer Research United Kingdom , Lincoln’s Inn Fields Laboratories , London , United Kingdom ; the Department of Immunology , Georg - August - University Go¨ttingen , Germany ; the Randall Centre for Molecular Mechanisms of Cell Function , King’s College London , United Kingdom ; the Department of Immunology , University College London , Windeyer Institute , United Kingdom ; and the Department of Clinical Immunology , Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust , London , United Kingdom .

Almost certainly the complex phenotype results from multiple defects of cell function and receptor signaling . 20 - 26 However , defects of migration identiﬁed in myeloid and T cells in vitro , and stem cells in vivo , 27 - 31 all support the hypothesis that many of the immunologic consequences of WASp deﬁciency arise from abnormal cell homing and spatial localization . In previous studies , we and others have characterized profound defects of WAS patient DC migration in vitro , including failure to achieve normal polarization and effective translocation . From these observations , it seemed likely that DC trafﬁcking abnormalities in vivo would contribute in a signiﬁ - cant way to the immunologic dysregulation of WAS . For example , the failure of DCs to localize appropriately within secondary lymphoid tissue , in the context of normal activation in terms of cytokine production or up - regulation of cell surface ligands , may be sufﬁcient to initiate ectopic and uncontrolled T - cell responses . Similarly , trapping of DCs at peripheral sites following activation may result in the formation of inﬂammatory foci . These hypothetical consequences of WASp deﬁciency on DC trafﬁc are difﬁcult to conﬁrm in vivo in patients with WAS . We have therefore used a murine model of WASp deﬁciency to demonstrate abnormalities of DC trafﬁcking in vivo . Materials and methods Mice WASp - deﬁcient mice ( WASp - null , sv129 background ) generated by gene targeting were a gift from Drs S . Snapper and F . Alt ( Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA ) . 21 The mice were bred and maintained in sterile isolators . Control mice were also from a sv129 background ( purchased from Harlan , Leicester , United Kingdom ) . All animal experiments were approved by the relevant regulatory authorities . Microbial - derived stimuli Soluble tachyzoite antigen ( STAg ) was prepared from tachyzoites of the RH 88 strain of Toxoplasma gondii , as previously described ( a gift from C . Reis e Sousa ) . 32 STAg was administered to mice at a dose of 10 (cid:2) g per mouse . Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) from Escherichia coli 026 : B6 ( Sigma , Poole , United Kingdom ) was used at 1 (cid:2) g per mouse . Each stimulus was dissolved in 200 (cid:2) L and injected intraperitoneally . Control mice received the same volume of phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) only . All animals were killed at the same time . Preliminary experiments showed that the response to STAg of the sv129 strain was comparable to that of other strains previously investigated . Isolation of bone marrow – derived dendritic cells Bone marrow – derived DCs ( BMDCs ) were prepared as described 33 with some modiﬁcations . Bone marrow ( BM ) from femora and tibiae of mice was distributed into Falcon ﬂasks ( BD Biosciences , Bedford , MA ) to a ﬁnal concentration of approximately 1 to 2 (cid:3) 10 6 cells / mL in RPMI 1640 Glutamax - 1 with HEPES ( N - 2 - hydroxyethylpiperazine - N (cid:4) - 2 - ethanesul - fonic acid , 25mM ; Gibco Life Technologies , Paisley , United Kingdom ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( Autogen Bioclear , Wiltshire , United Kingdom ) and 10 000 IU / mL penicillin and streptomycin ( Gibco Life Technologies ) . Granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) was in the form of a supernatant derived from a plasmacytoma cell line transfected with an expression vector containing the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) – derived mouse GM - CSF gene 34 and used at 5 % of the conditioned medium ( CM ) . Alternatively recombinant GM - CSF ( Insight Biotechnology , Middlesex , United Kingdom ) was used at 25 ng / mL . On day 3 growth media was replenished . Cells were then harvested on day 8 by centrifugation . BMDC phenotyping On day 7 to 8 the ﬂoating cell fraction of the BMDC culture was extracted and washed with PBS . Cells were stained with a panel of antibodies including CD11c - ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ; clone HL3 ) , unlabeled I - A b supernatant , unlabeled CD80 ( clone 1G10 ) , unlabeled DEC205 supernatant , and a monoclonal antibody speciﬁc for mouse CCR7 , 35 in FACS ( ﬂuorescence activated cell sorting ) washing buffer ( FWB ) . After 45 minutes , cells were washed twice in FWB and stained with FITC - labeled anti - rat ( for unlabeled antibodies ) . After 30 minutes cells were washed again and visualized by ﬂow cytometry using a Beckman Coulter FACS ( High Wycombe , United Kingdom ) . Cell motility studies BMDCs ( 10 5 ) , prepared as outlined in “BMDC phenotyping , ” were plated on ﬁbronectin ( FN ) – coated 13 - mm coverslips and allowed to adhere for 2 hours at 37°C / 5 % CO 2 . Dunn chambers ( Weber Scientiﬁc , Hamilton , NJ ) were assembled as previously described . 14 , 36 Inner and outer wells of the Dunn chambers were ﬁlled with CM supplemented with GM - CSF . For each experiment 2 Dunn chambers were run in parallel . Dunn chambers were maintained at 37°C / 5 % CO 2 on a microscope stage . Using an inverted microscope ( Olympus , Southall , United Kingdom ) cells located on the viewing bridge of the chamber were visualized using a 20 (cid:3) / 0 . 4 objective lens with a 1 . 5 (cid:3) optivar . Images were acquired using Sony video cameras ( CCD - IRIS ) and either recorded on to a Betacam SP recorder ( Sony , Berkshire , United Kingdom ) or on to a personal computer ( PC ) using AQM : AMVS ( Kinetic Imaging , Nottingham , United Kingdom ) . The cam - era was set to acquire 1 frame every 10 minutes over a 5 - hour period . The processed sequences were then replayed as a movie . To test cell motility to CCL21 , BMDCs were isolated as described earlier but with addition of LPS at 0 . 5 (cid:2) g / mL on day 6 , and with selection of CD11c (cid:5) cells using magnetic activated cell sorting ( MACS ) microbeads ( clone N418 ; Miltenyi Biotec , Surrey , United Kingdom ) according to manufacturer’s instructions on day 7 . Matured BMDCs were similar in phenotype to the pre - LPS – treated cells with regard to CD11c (cid:5) and I - A b (cid:5) expression . Dunn chambers and the outer well of the chamber were either ﬁlled with CM or CM supplemented with recombinant murine CCL21 ( at 100 ng / mL ; R & D Systems , Abingdon , United Kingdom ) . Dunn chambers were maintained at 37°C on a micro - scope stage ( Zeiss Axiovert 135 ; Zeiss , Hertfordshire , United Kingdom ) , and cell motility was recorded using a 10 (cid:3) / 0 . 25 objective lens for the next 5 hours ( the stimulation period ) using a Hamamatsu digital camera ( C4742 - 95 ) and Improvision Openlab software version 3 ( Improvision , Coventry , United Kingdom ) . Images were ﬁrst analyzed as described previously 28 , 37 and processed using Mathematica notebooks version 4 ( Wolfram Research , Champaign , IL ) , which provide detailed statistical data on the rates of leukocyte movement and related migration parameters . FITC sensitization and detection in LNs Preliminary experiments examined the amount of FITC required for detection , the solvent requirements , and different time points . On the basis of these results , 0 . 5 % FITC was dissolved in a 1 : 1 ( vol : vol ) acetone / dibutyl phthalate mixture immediately before application to give a ﬁnal concentra - tion of 5 mg / mL . Mice were painted on the abdomen with 0 . 2 mL FITC . At 4 hours and 18 hours , inguinal LNs were removed , and cell suspensions were obtained after digestion with Liberase CI ( Boehringer Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) and DNAse I ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) for 20 minutes at 37°C . Next , cells were washed twice in PBS / 5 mM ethylene diamine tetra - acetic acid ( EDTA ) , and the resultant LN cell suspension was depleted of B cells and T cells using anti - IgG ( immunoglobulin G ) and anti - Thy . 1 Dynabeads ( product nos . 114 . 03 and 114 . 01 ; Dynal , Oslo , Norway ) . LNs were pooled from 2 mice for each category , because insufﬁcient cells could be harvested from individual nodes . Preliminary experiments showed that FITC was not associated with F4 / 80 (cid:5) cells , supportingthenotionthatcellsmigratingtoLNswithFITCareDCs , ashasbeen reported previously . 38 The remaining cells were stained with biotinylated I - A b ( clone KH74 ) for 1 hour followed by streptavidin – phycoerythrin ( PE ) for 30 minutes . After gating on live cells , events ( 30 000 - 50 000 ) were collected using BeckmanCoulterFACSmachine ( HighWycombe , UnitedKingdom ) .

Control mice received AOO only . The ears were removed after 4 hours to quantify the number of Langerhans cells ( LCs ) before and after sensitiza - tion , where a drop in LC number of cells indicated emigration from the skin . The method of LC quantiﬁcation followed has been described previously . 39 Brieﬂy , ears were excised and split into dorsal and ventral halves using ﬁne forceps . Dorsal halves were incubated in 0 . 02 M EDTA at 37°C for 90 minutes to allow separation of the epidermis and dermis . Epidermal sheets were peeled away from the dermis carefully , washed twice in PBS , ﬁxed in acetone ( (cid:6) 20°C , 20 minutes ) , and washed again . The sheets were incubated with biotin – anti - mouse I - A b ( 5 (cid:2) g / mL in PBS with 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin [ BSA ] , 60 minutes , at room temperature ) , washed 3 times , and then incubated for an additional 45 minutes with streptavidin - FITC . After further washes the epidermal sheets were mounted in Citiﬂuor AF1 Mountant Medium ( Citiﬂuor , Leicester , United Kingdom ) . LCs were counted on a Zeiss Axiophot2ﬂuorescentmicroscope ( Zeiss ) in10ﬁeldsinthecentralportionofthe ear using a calibrated grid eyepiece in a 40 (cid:3) / 0 . 75 objective lens . Results were expressedasthemeanplus or minus standard deviation of the number of LCs per square millimeter of epidermis . LCs were imaged on the same microscope and processed using Improvision Openlab software version 3 ( Improvision , Coventry , United Kingdom ) . Immunohistochemistry Spleens were cut transversely through the hilus , and a slice was rapidly frozen in tissue mounting gel in a dry ice / isopentane bath . The rest of the spleen was used for ﬂow cytometric analysis . Cryosections ( 7 (cid:2) m ) were cut onto poly - L - lysine – coated slides ( BDH , Poole , United Kingdom ) and stored at (cid:6) 70°C . Slides were thawed and ﬁxed in acetone at room temperature for 10 minutes and rehydrated in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0 . 3 % H 2 O 2 . Sections were stained with a biotin - conjugated hamster anti - mouse CD11c antibody ( clone HL3 ) and unconjugated rat anti - mouse CD19 ( clone 1D3 ) in 0 . 5 % Biorad blocker ( BioRad Laboratories , Hercules , CA ) at a concentration of 5 (cid:2) g / mLfor 1 to 2 hours at room temperature . Antibody - treated sections were washed 5 times in PBS and then incubated with a streptavidin - biotinylated peroxidase complex ( Vectastain ABC kit ; Vector Laboratories , Peterborough , United Kingdom ) for 30 minutes at room temperature . Peroxidase activity was visualized using Immunopure Metal Enhanced DAB ( diaminobenzidine ) substrate Kit ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) and washed again in PBS . To determine CD19 expression , sections were stained with biotin - conjugated mouse F ( ab (cid:4) ) 2 anti - rat IgG ( 1 . 4 (cid:2) g / mL ; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , West Grove , PA ) . After repeated washing , sections were incubated with a streptavidin - biotinylated phosphatase complex ( Vectastain , ABC - AP kit ) and developed with vector - red substrate ( both Vector Laboratories ) . The tissue was counterstained with methyl green , and after dehydrating , the tissue was mounted in 1 , 3 - diethyl - 8 - phenylxanthine ( DPX ) mountant ( BDH ) . All antibodies were purchased from Pharmingen ( San Diego , CA ) unless otherwise stated . Spleen sections were imaged using a Zeiss Axioplan2 light microscope ( Zeiss ) equipped with 10 (cid:3) / 0 . 3 and 20 (cid:3) / 0 . 5 objective lenses . Images were captured with Progress version 5 plugin ( Jenoptik , Jena , Germany ) for Adobe Photoshop 6 . 0 software ( Adobe Systems , Uxbridge , United Kingdom ) . Flow cytometric analysis of STAg - stimulated DCs Spleen cell suspensions were obtained as described earlier in “FITC sensitization and detection in LNs . ” Spleen cells were ﬁxed in 1 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes , washed , and kept overnight in FWB containing PBS , 0 . 5 % BSA , and 0 . 01 % NaN 3 at 4°C . The next day cells at 5 to 10 (cid:3) 10 6 / 500 (cid:2) L were blocked with anti - mouse Fc (cid:7) III / II receptor ( clone 2 . 4G2 ) at 5 (cid:2) g / mL for 5 minutes and then stained with either biotinylated rat anti – mouse interleukin 12 ( IL - 12 ) p40 / p70 ( clone C17 . 8 or 15 . 6 ) or biotinylated rat anti - mouse CD40 ( clone 3 / 23 ) for 1 hour . After 3 further washes with FWB , cells were stained with R - PE conjugated rat anti – mouse CD8 (cid:8) ( Ly2 ) ( clone 53 - 6 . 7 ) and FITC - conjugated hamster anti – mouse CD11c ( clone HL3 ) , as well as Streptavidin - Cychrome ( BD Pharmingen , San Diego , CA ) . After gating on live cells , events ( not (cid:9) 300 000 ) were collected on a FACScan cytometer ( Becton Dickinson , Mountain View , CA ) and analyzed using FlowJo software ( Treestar , San Carlos , CA ) . Results WASp - null BMDCs exhibit migratory defects in vitro The inability of human DCs derived from patients with WAS to form podosomes and their failure to migrate effectively have been reported previously . 13 , 28 The actin cytoskeleton , determined by staining of BMDCs with rhodamine phalloidin , was morphologi - cally similar to that of human WASp - null DCs , and podosomes were not formed ( Siobha´n Burns and A . J . T . , unpublished observa - tions , February 2001 ) . The immunophenotype of WASp - null immature BMDCs was the same as that of control cells ( Figure 1 ) . Time - lapse video microscopy showed that immature BMDCs derived from control mice moved rapidly across a ﬁbronectin ( FN ) – coated surface . The BMDCs polarized , formed a clear leading edge , and established transient but stable contact at this end ( Figure 2A and supplemental movie 1A ) . This was followed by retraction of the trailing edge and net forward motion . In contrast , WASp - null BMDCs failed to establish a dominant leading edge and were unable to detach appropriately ( Figure 2Aand supplemen - tal movie 1B ) . This resulted in the formation of a relatively static hyperextended cell morphology , oscillation of the cell body between each pole , and restricted translocation ( Figure 2B ) . Therefore , WASp - null murine DCs exhibit a cytoskeletal phenotype in vitro identical to that observed in mutant human cells and are indicative of signiﬁcant migratory defects . Impaired response to CCL21 in vitro DCs homing to the LN from the skin and within lymphoid tissue are known to involve the up - regulation of chemokine receptor Figure 1 .

Speciﬁcally , CCL21 is expressed on high endothelial venules ( HEVs ) , by stromal cells within T - cell zones , and on lymphatic endothelium . 40 The chemokinetic response of WASp - null DCs to CCL21 was therefore tested in vitro . BMDCs that had been matured overnight with LPS ( to render them responsive to CCL21 ) , plated on to FN - coated coverslips , were ﬁlmed over a 5 - hour period in a Dunn chamber . Maturation of normal and WASp - deﬁcient cells determined by up - regulation of CD80 , CD86 , major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II was similar ( data not shown ) . As expected , LPS - matured DCs derived from both normal and WASp - null animals migrated minimally in CM me - dium alone . 4 In the presence of CCL21 , normal BMDCs increased their speed and distance traveled from their origin , while WASp - null cells were signiﬁcantly less motile ( particularly in terms of persistence of migration ) over this time period ( Figure 3A , and supplemental movie 2A - D ) . The deﬁciency of migration could not be accounted for by differences in CCR7 expression , as these were shown to be equivalent both at the level of mRNA ( quantitative PCR , data not shown ) and surface protein ( Figure 3B ) . Interest - ingly , the velocity of normal cells to CCL21 is comparable to that observed during contact between primed DCs and T cells in the LN in vivo using the 2 - photon microscopy model . 41 Delayed migration of WASp - null – deﬁcient DCs from the skin to the draining LN Migration of DCs is important during exit from peripheral tissues , where they enter lymphatics and eventually reach draining lym - phoid tissue . To test the hypothesis that DC migration from peripheral sites is compromised in the absence of WASp in vivo , the abdominal skin of normal and mutant mice was sensitized with FITC , and the draining LNs were sampled at subsequent time points . FITC - bearing DCs were identiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry using anti – I - A b following magnetic bead depletion of B and T cells . At 4 hours after sensitization a population of I - A b (cid:5) FITC (cid:5) cells could be detected in normal LNs ( Figure 4A ) , and this was found to be signiﬁcantly higher compared with that in WASp - null nodes ( P (cid:9) . 05 , Mann - Whitney test ) ( Figure 4B ) . By 18 hours a popula - tion of I - A b (cid:5) FITC (cid:5) cells was identiﬁed consistently in normal nodes in all experiments ( Figure 4A ) . This was not always seen in WASp - null mice , where in some experiments the population of WASp - null I - A b (cid:5) FITC (cid:5) cells in the LN remained reduced at 18 hours ( Figure 4B ) . However , in the remaining ( (cid:10) 60 % ) of the experiments WASp - null I - A b (cid:5) FITC (cid:5) migrants were found in similar levels to those seen in the normal mice , so that overall the differences were not signiﬁcant ( Figure 4B ) . These results indicate that the homing response of DCs lacking WASp is impaired at early time points , resulting in reduced numbers of cells reaching the draining lymphoid tissue following peripheral stimulation , and that this lag period of migration can sometimes persist for as much as 18 hours . In the course of these experiments it was noted that LNs from normal animals responded to challenge by increase in size and cellularity , whereas WASp - null LNs remained relatively un - changed ( not shown ) . The increase in size presumably reﬂects direct modulation of the kinetics of lymphocyte trafﬁc and production of inﬂammatory cytokines by migrating DCs as has been shown previously . 42 , 43 These ﬁndings are reminiscent of the response to injection of CCR7 (cid:5) normal DCs , which induce LN congestion , and CCR7 (cid:6) DCs , which fail to migrate to the LN and do not cause congestion . 43 Therefore , abrogated migration of WASp - null DCs to the lymphatics may reﬂect a reduced response to the CCR7 ligand CCL21 , as observed in vitro . Diminished migration of WASp - null LCs after contact sensitization To exclude the possibility that reduced migration of FITC - labeled DCs to regional LNs reﬂected a quantitative deﬁciency of periph - eral LCs , the number of class II – positive cells in the epidermis was determined by immunohistochemistry . The density of I - Ab (cid:5) LCs in the skin of normal and WASp - null mice was comparable ( sv129 control , 815 (cid:11) 104 LC / mm 2 ; WASp - null , 821 (cid:11) 96 LC / mm 2 ; Figure 5A ) , indicating that the steady - state maintenance of LCs in skin , which is dependent on self - renewal , is not compromised quantitatively in the absence of WASp . 44 Next , we investigated whether a contribution to the reduction in DC trafﬁc in WASp - null mice was caused by an inability of adequate numbers of LCs to emigrate from the epidermis . Normal and WASp - null mice were sensitized with oxazolone , and the density of LCs in the epidermis was again determined . Previous studies have shown that the greatest reduction in epidermal LCs occurs at 4 hours . 39 , 45 In this study , 4 hours after application of oxazolone there was an expected Figure 2 . DCs derived from WASp - null mice show a defect in random motility in complete medium ( CM ) in vitro .

In contrast , levels of WASp - null LCs remained unchanged compared with those of vector ( acetone and olive oil [ AOO ] ) – treated ears ( Figure 5A ) . In normal mice there was a signiﬁcant decline in LC frequency in sensitized skin compared with vector - treated skin ( from 836 (cid:11) 107 LC / mm 2 to 535 (cid:11) 71 LC / mm 2 ; P (cid:9) . 001 ; Student t test ) ( Figure 5B ) . Sensitized LC frequencies in normal mice were also signiﬁ - cantly lower compared with those of WASp - null mice ( P (cid:9) . 005 ; Student t test ) . LC numbers in WASp - null epidermal sheets were not signiﬁcantly different from those that had been treated with vector alone ( from 855 (cid:11) 101 LC / mm 2 to 761 (cid:11) 101 LC / mm 2 ; Student t test ) ( Figure 5B ) . These ﬁndings indicate that at least a component of reduced migration to draining lymphoid tissue is due to compromised emigration from peripheral sentinel sites but does not exclude a contribution from defects in trafﬁc through the lymphatics and entry into LNs . Incomplete localization of WASp - null DCs to splenic T - cell areas DCs are also mobilized within lymphoid tissue in vivo during an immune response to systemic antigen . This response was examined by intraperitoneal challenge with microbial agents , STAg or LPS , that are known to drain into the spleen and stimulate immature interdigitating DCs to migrate exclusively within the T - cell zone and to form tight clusters . 32 , 46 Having established that the distribu - tion of interdigitating DCs in unstimulated WASp - null spleen was normal , the mice were challenged with the microbial stimuli . DCs from both normal and WASp - null mice were found to redistribute 6 hours after injection of STAg , forming clusters in T - cell areas ( Figure 6A ) . However , in contrast with the normal spleens , in WASp - null spleens a higher proportion of DCs were retained ectopically in the marginal zone ( MZ ) , suggesting that there was Figure 3 .

Similar abnormalities of DC migration were observed following administra - tion of LPS ( Figure 6B ) . Mobilization of DCs in response to challenge has been shown to coincide with increased expression of CD40 and production of high levels of IL - 12 . 32 As expected , following administration of STAg , CD8 (cid:8) (cid:5) DCs from control mice up - regulated expression of CD40 and secreted IL - 12p40 / p70 ( Fig - ure 7 ) . DCs from WASp - null mice showed similar patterns of activation , indicating that these processes are largely indepen - dent of WASp . In addition , overnight culture of 10 5 splenocytes from STAg - primed mice revealed no signiﬁcant difference in the levels of IL - 12p40 / p70 compared with splenocytes from control mice as measured by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ; data not shown ) . A confounding observation was that the splenic architecture of WASp - null animals ( maintained in a sterile environment ) was morphologically distinct from that of control animals with respect to several features . WASp - null mice often exhibited splenomegaly , and , although B - and T - cell segregation was observed , the white pulp was spatially disorganized and unevenly distributed ( see Figure 5 . Migration of WASp - null LCs out of the epidermis is diminished . ( A ) Epidermal sheets were prepared following topical application of 0 . 1 % oxazolone in AOO ( acetone and olive oil ) or AOO alone ( vector ) . Staining with I - A b (cid:5) – FITC identiﬁed LCs and revealed fewer numbers of these cells in normal animals that had been sensitized compared with those treated with vector alone .

IMPAIRED CELLMIGRATION IN WASp - DEFICIENT MICE 1595 BLOOD , 15 FEBRUARY 2005 (cid:1) VOLUME 105 , NUMBER 4 For personal use only . on April 6 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From Figure 3A ) , forming larger aggregates that are normally seen on equivalent transverse sections . A narrower marginal zone with marked depletion of MZ B cells was also noted ( not shown ) , similar to that seen in human splenic tissue from patients with WAS . 47 These abnormal features could compromise appropriate localization of WASp - null interdigitating DCs to T - cell areas , although WASp - null primary ( immature ) splenic DCs sorted for CD11c (cid:5) and I - A b (cid:5) expression by FACS ( (cid:1) 98 % purity ) displayed defective motility on FNs similar to that observed for BMDCs ( data not shown ) . We conclude therefore that migration of mutant CD8 (cid:8) splenic DCs is compromised as a result of intrinsic cytoskeletal defects , but that activation can be initiated normally . Discussion In this study we have shown that WASp - null DCs exhibit defects of cell migration at multiple levels in vivo , including emigration from skin , trafﬁcking to draining LNs , and spatial localization within the LNs . There are clearly many ways in which these defects could contribute to immune dysregulation . Inefﬁcient delivery of antigen to lymphoid tissue would compromise the development of physiologic immune responses , and activation without migration to a regulated microenvironment could result in the initiation or propagation of ectopic inﬂammatory pro - cesses . The maintenance of tolerance , and the homeostatic regulation of naive and memory T - cell populations , which require varying degrees of interaction between MHC and T - cell receptor ( TCR ) to preserve numbers and function , might therefore also be disturbed . 48 As shown in this study , the defects of cell migration in vivo are not absolute , and proper localiza - tion may be achieved over time . However , the requirement for coordinated interaction ( both temporal and spatial ) between antigen , immune cells such as DCs and T cells , and their microenvironment would predict that subtle aberrations might well be sufﬁcient to dysregulate normal immune mechanisms . Contributions from intrinsically defective TCR signaling or T - cell trafﬁcking are also probable and will require the develop - ment of lineage - speciﬁc murine models of WASp deﬁciency in order to be evaluated fully . Abnormalities of WASp - null DC migration , which previously have been described in human cells , are as shown here , mirrored in murine cells . The underlying cellular mechanisms are probably multiple but relate to the defective function of the actin cytoskel - eton . It is likely that mutant DCs are defective for chemotaxis ( the directional response to stimuli ) as has been observed in macro - phages . 27 , 29 This reﬂects defective polarization and formation of ﬁlopodia , which are necessary for a normal chemotactic response as demonstrated by inhibition of Cdc42 in a Bac1 macrophage cell line . 37 However , the quality of migration of WASp - null DCs is also highly disturbed , both in terms of development of a dominant leading edge and retraction of the tail . This is indicative of defects in protrusive activity and in the dynamics of adhesion . Unsurpris - ingly , many aspects are mimicked by inhibition of Rho GTPases by Clostridium difﬁcile toxin B . 15 The absence of podosomes may contribute signiﬁcantly to the inability of cells such as DCs and macrophages to rapidly attach and detach from substrata . The formation of these structures is regulated in a concerted way by Cdc42 , Rac , and RhoA but is absolutely dependent on WASp . 14 Maturation of DCs is associated with the disappearance of podo - somes within 2 to 4 hours , suggesting that they are important early on in the migratory process of peripheral DCs on the way to draining secondary lymphoid tissue . 19 The concentrated expression of the (cid:1) 2 - family of integrins on DC podosomes also suggests that a key function is for diapedesis , including entry or exit from the lymphatic system through interaction with molecules such as ICAM - 1 or JAM - A . Together , abnormalities of DC migration , and of migration of T and B lymphocytes , are likely to be responsible for the observed disorganization of microarchitecture in the lymphoid tissues of WASp - null animals . There is some resemblance to the ﬁndings in CCR7 - deﬁcient animals , where failure of lymphocyte and DC migration leads to profound abnormalities in the microarchitecture of all secondary lymphoid tissue . 49 CCR7 is responsible for migration of DCs to lymphatics and is up - regulated following activation . 50 The ligands for CCR7 are CCL19 , expressed by stromal cells and mature DCs in T - cell areas , and CCL21 , expressed by lymphatic endothelial cells . Unsurprisingly , there - fore , DCs from CCR7 - null mice , although able to activate normally in vitro , fail to migrate to draining LNs 49 and also fail to induce changes in the kinetics of lymphocyte trafﬁc that normally result in LN congestion after DC migration . 43 Defects of DC accumulation in T - cell zones have also been demonstrated in plt / plt mice that are functionally deﬁcient in both CCL19 and CCL21 . 51 CCR7 has also recently been shown to be a key regulator of DC migration into afferent dermal lymphatics under inﬂammatory and steady - state conditions , suggesting an important role for maintenance of peripheral tolerance as well as for generation of protective immu - nity . 52 As shown in this study , WASp - null DCs exhibit a reduced response to CCL21 and also defective homing to lymph nodes . We also noted that the kinetics of lymphocyte trafﬁc after contact sensitization was not normally increased in WASp - null animals . Although not conclusive , it is likely that these observations are directly linked . It is also likely that WASp - null DCs are compro - mised in their ability to respond to other speciﬁc chemokinetic stimuli , eg , during clustering in T - cell areas after challenge with systemic microbial antigen , although this has not yet been investi - gated in detail . The contribution of abnormal DC trafﬁcking to the immunodeﬁciency ( and breakdown of tolerance ) in the WAS is difﬁcult to ascertain because of deﬁciencies in multiple immune cell lineages . The development of lineage - restricted WASp - deﬁcient models may be useful in this context . Likewise , CCR7 mediates trafﬁcking of both DCs and lymphocytes , and , al - though a direct parallel cannot be drawn between WASp deﬁciency and CCR7 deﬁciency , the delayed antibody responses and delayed - type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) reactions that have been observed in both models could arise ( at least in part ) from similar trafﬁcking defects . In summary , we have demonstrated in this study that WASp is a key molecule for the regulated migration and trafﬁcking of DCs in vivo and suggest that defects in this process may promote abnormalities of immune response and maintenance of tolerance . We also suggest that disturbances of immune cell trafﬁcking , including DCs , are likely to provide an explanation for many of the immunologic abnormalities of the WAS .
