Home - embedded visual AI sensors continuously monitor the resident , inferring her activities and internal states that enable higher - level services . Here , as home - embedded sensors passively monitor a free person , good inferences happen randomly . The inferences’ confidence highly depends on how congruent her momentary conditions are to the conditions favored by the AI models , e . g . , front - facing or unobstructed . We envision new strategies of AI - to - Human Actuation ( AHA ) that empower the sensory AIs with proactive actuation so that they induce the person’s conditions to be more favorable to the AIs . In this light , we explore the initial feasibility and efficacy of AHA in the context of home - embedded visual AIs . We build a taxonomy of actuations that could be issued to home residents to benefit visual AIs . We deploy AHA in an actual home rich in sensors and interactive devices . With 20 participants , we comprehensively study their experiences with proactive actuation blended with their usual home routines . We also demonstrate the substantially improved inferences of the actuation - empowered AIs over the passive sensing baseline . This paper sets forth an initial step towards interweaving human - targeted AIs and proactive actuation to yield more chances for high - confidence inferences without sophisticating the model , in order to improve robustness against unfavorable conditions .

An example of how AI - to - human actuation complements an AI sensor under perception difficulty grandfather , showing off her masterpiece drawing right in front of his eyes , as usual . The grandfather , farsighted , cannot see the details . “Wow , too close , sweetie . ” He says . “Oops , sorry grandpa . ” She moves it a little back . The key takeaways from these episodes are : ( 1 ) our human - to - human perception abilities are often challenged by unfavorable conditions , and ( 2 ) we , humans , often overcome such challenges by actively actuating the target towards a more favorable condition to help our perception , rather than passively waiting until the conditions become favorable . Now , think about a near - future smart home , which embeds a number of AI - powered sensors surrounding the living area , continuously monitoring the resident’s physiology [ 3 , 56 ] , home activities [ 66 , 78 , 79 , 98 ] , emotions [ 99 , 100 , 115 ] , exercises [ 109 , 111 ] , verbal expressions [ 30 , 38 , 39 , 138 ] , social interactions [ 62 , 75 , 158 ] , etc . , producing contextual ingredients that enable higher - level services . Naturally , the sensors often suffer from unfavorable human - to - AI conditions , e . g . , views being obstructed , the target person being too far or too close , and points of interest such as the face being sideways or opposite orientation . Here , the sensors remain passive and have no choice but to wait for favorable human - to - AI conditions to happen . In this paper , we propose a novel strategy of AI - to - Human Actuation ( AHA ) . We begin by posing a question : “What if an AI sensor is complemented by a proactive actuation on the target human to induce her conditions more favorable to the AI’s perception ? ” This is analogous to how humans improvise for easier perceptions as illustrated in the first paragraph . Figure 1 depicts an example embodiment of AHA out of many that we developed . The vision AI sensor continuously infers the user’s context by observing her activity and objects being used . Currently the user is standing with her back to the camera , making its inference difficult . At this point , a proactive actuation is given , e . g . , the smart speaker initiates a conversation in this example . It naturally induces her to turn around , yielding a favorable view to the vision AI sensor . We present an initial exploration of AHA , in terms of its real feasibility , efficacy to AI , and user acceptance , with focus on smart home - embedded visual AI services . Specifically , we explore the following three aspects . Firstly , the method of AI - to - human actuation . We anticipate that modern smart homes would be rich in not only sensors but also actuators , e . g . , pervasive displays , smart speakers , autonomous lighting , and home robotics . Originally , they are born to serve the residents’ comfort . But we envision that they can be appropriated to benefit the inferences of other sensors . In this light , to help characterize the actuation , we devise a taxonomy of actuations across human - perceptive properties and actuation - induced reaction based on existing actuators’ actions . Secondly , the benefit of AI - to - human actuation . To motivate , we experiment the dependency between the AI sensors’ inferences and the human - to - AI conditions , demonstrating diminishing confidence as the condition deviates from the ideal . Then , using the taxonomy we devised , we deploy various types of AI - to - human actuation in a near - future smart home environment with multiple visual AIs running . Extensive experiment results demonstrate how such actuations improve various human - sensing visual AI models’ inference quality . Thirdly , the acceptance of AI - to - human actuation . Actuation’s noticeability or acceptability to the target human may vary , depending on the type of actuation , the obtrusive levels of the actuation , and the context of the Proc . ACM Interact .

AI - to - Human Actuation : Boosting Unmodified AI’s Robustness by Proactively Inducing Favorable Human Sensing Conditions • 6 : 3 human . We derive quantitative and qualitative findings on the user experiences from the experiments in our actuated smart home . To explore the benefit and acceptance aspects , we instrumented an actual home with a number of cameras , speakers , and displays deployed – some representative samples of pervasive home sensors and actuators . Therein , we experimented with a total of 20 participants , for a total of 42 hours , under the actuated setting as well as baselines . We believe that our AHA approach brings a new dimension to improving the effective performances of AI models . Previous research [ 19 , 32 , 50 , 163 ] on tackling unfavorable human - to - AI conditions have focused mainly on model - or dataset - centric fortification , while leaving the AI sensors passive . These attempts usually resulted in increased system sophistication or computation complexity , making it less appropriate to run on existing commodity smart devices . Instead , our AHA newly investigates the AI - human interaction dimension , integrating emerging proactive interactions into a crisp showcase of eliciting favorable sensing conditions and following AI performance improvement , without robustness - aware specialization on models or datasets . Our key contributions are as follows . First , we propose a novel concept of AI - to - Human Actuation ( AHA ) , a strategy to strengthen human - targeted AI model’s effective performances under sub - optimal sensing conditions ; our strategy is orthogonal to existing ML / CV approaches which have not considered the actively interact - able nature of humans . Second , we comprehensively explore the characterization and initial embodiment of AHA , with crisp experimental demonstration in an apartment home that AHA substantially improves the AI performance in various sensing conditions and yields positive and acceptable user experiences . Third , from experiments and observations , we derive early guidelines to facilitate exercising AHA in further deployment . The rest of this paper is organized as follows . § 2 outlines the background and related works . In § 3 , we motivate AHA through micro - experiments that articulate the AI’s sensitivity upon sub - optimal conditions . § 4 suggests an initial taxonomy of actuation , and § 5 defines the scope of this initial study on AHA . § 6 describes our testbed in a real apartment home . § 7 and § 8 describe our experiments and organize our findings in terms of AI performance metrics and user experiences . § 9 discusses implications , limitations , and preliminary feasibility . § 10 concludes the paper . 2 BACKGROUND Broadly , AHA is positioned in the problem space of facilitating human - targeted AI be more effective in unfavorable real - life sensing conditions . We firstly review the approaches for robust AI in ML , CV , and HCI literature ( § 2 . 1 ) , and highlight that AHA opens a novel , orthogonal solution to this problem . Methodologically , AHA adopts proactive interactions . Therefore , we examine existing proactive interactions from which we cultivate our actuations ( § 2 . 2 ) . For extended positioning , we reflect AHA upon the domain of Human - AI Interaction and clarify the unique goal that differentiates AHA as well as those shared in common ( § 2 . 3 ) . Finally , we review prior studies that have conceptually inspired and are partly analogous to our approach and clarify the main differences . ( § 2 . 4 , § 2 . 5 ) . 2 . 1 AI Models with Robustness to Sub - optimal AI - to - Human Conditions Advanced architectures of visual AI models have been developed to strengthen in - the - wild robustness , e . g . , diverse facial orientations [ 32 , 50 ] and occluded human bodies [ 19 , 105 , 135 , 163 , 165 ] . Due to their increased complexity , these models become harder to run on resource - tight platforms . Model downsizing [ 47 , 53 , 89 ] has been proposed to mitigate this issue , but it suffers from a trade - off between computation and accuracy . Cloud offloading [ 48 , 121 , 154 ] has also been suggested , but it accompanies privacy concerns . In HCI and UbiComp , achieving in - the - wild robustness with resource - tight platforms has been a serious mission to ensure practical usability [ 63 , 120 ] . GymCam [ 71 ] , a single - point vision that oversees concurrent exercises , tackles the problem of heavy occlusion by understanding that an exercise may consist of repetitive motions . Proc . ACM Interact . Mob . Wearable Ubiquitous Technol . , Vol . 7 , No . 1 , Article 6 . Publication date : March 2023 . 6 : 4 • Cho et al . FitByte [ 12 ] and NeckSense [ 164 ] present robust wearable solutions to monitor eating that are usable during an entire unconstrained day , by developing a multi - modal sensing covering end - to - end intake activities and sensor - fusion for accurate chewing detection . Still , each solution is engineered with activity - specific specializations ; applicability to other activities would require extensive re - engineering . The multi - modal sensing architectures essentially share the philosophy of strengthening AI . After all , it is a tug - of - war of real - life robustness vs . complexity of the model or system . AHA opens a new dimension to fight this war . AHA leverages the abundant smart devices around us ( § 2 . 2 ) to exert a cue to the human so that her condition is steered from AI - unfavorable to AI - favorable . AHA’s unique advantage is to benefit even basic models without specialization to boost their effective robustness in real - life . Furthermore , AHA may be flexible upon emerging new types of unfavorable real - life conditions , in constrat to model specialization , which would require re - training , modifications , or both . 2 . 2 Proactive Interaction from Everyday Devices Proactive interactions have been studied extensively in push notifications [ 69 , 95 , 96 , 108 , 113 , 116 ] , proactive speakers [ 13 , 17 , 25 , 72 , 82 , 83 , 117 , 144 , 145 ] , and interactive displays [ 5 , 137 , 142 , 157 , 159 ] . Advanced un - derstanding of the user’s demand and interruptibility show the possibility of tailoring when , where , and how proactive interactions are delivered and naturally blended with the user’s current context [ 8 , 17 , 61 , 74 , 116 ] . For example , Voit et al . [ 140 ] explored proactive notifications from a smart plant system in opportune locations at opportune moments to reduce the negative effects and induce the user to respond immediately . Also , Cha et al . [ 17 ] explored various factors that are related to opportune moments for proactive smart speakers to initiate a conversation , such as personal or social contexts and movements of the residents . We believe that we can reasonably anticipate near - future readiness to easily accommodate AHA in our everyday environments . Desired actuation could be exerted by modestly appropriating proactive interactions which are readily abundant and familiar to the users . Furthermore , proliferation of proactive interactions from diverse devices of various modality would allow multiple options to convey a desired actuation at a given moment such that the actuation could be exerted optimally , e . g . , in a least obtrusive , most timely , or context - relevant manner . 2 . 3 Human - AI Interaction Models The spectrum of human - AI interaction models has been largely discussed in terms of the balance between human - control and computer - automation [ 130 ] . Examples of interaction models in this spectrum include : ( 1 ) AI guides and human performs , such as in guided creation [ 80 ] and design ideation [ 77 ] ; ( 2 ) AI suggests and human decides , such as in recommender systems [ 27 , 67 , 68 , 84 ] and auto - completion [ 40 ] ; ( 3 ) AI decides and human fixes , such as in code translation [ 147 ] and auto - correction [ 11 , 91 ] ; ( 4 ) human suggests and AI decides , such as in generative models [ 103 , 167 ] . Most human - AI interaction models eventually converge to assisting human tasks . Although our work shares the key stakeholders ( i . e . , humans , AIs , and signals in between ) , AHA pursues a different goal – assisting the AIs to perform better by deploying actuation that remains as transparent as possible to the user . Fundamentally though , helping the AI perform better would be said to prevent an ill - performing AI from harming the human experiences [ 8 ] . 2 . 4 Steering User Behaviors and Contexts In mobile crowd sensing [ 16 , 37 , 46 , 58 – 60 , 73 , 119 , 131 , 152 , 156 ] , incentivization counters the non - uniform coverage and information quality [ 122 , 153 ] , steering the crowd’s location , sensing density , and quality of Proc . ACM Interact . Mob . Wearable Ubiquitous Technol . , Vol . 7 , No . 1 , Article 6 . Publication date : March 2023 . AI - to - Human Actuation : Boosting Unmodified AI’s Robustness by Proactively Inducing Favorable Human Sensing Conditions • 6 : 5 sensing [ 70 , 114 ] . Proper sensory stimuli can also guide the user’s internal context changes , such as inducing emo - tion [ 136 ] , regulating breathing rates [ 107 ] , improving cognitive performance [ 24 ] , and manipulating subjective time [ 129 ] . Our approach shares high - level philosophy , in that a cue is exerted to steer a condition associated with the user in a way to improve task - specific metrics . However , our notion of steering features a unique objective , i . e . , improving the effective performance of perceptive AI models that are not necessarily sophisticated for real - life robustness . To this end , our approach separates the user’s condition to be steered from the user’s context to be inferred . Thus , our research questions include preserving the user’s target context despite actuation . Also , we question noticeability , awkwardness , and contextual fit of a certain actuation type with respect to the AI’s sensing task , instead of monetary incentives . 2 . 5 Initiation and Calibration Gestures to Help Segmentation and Recognition Gesture - based systems often employ initiation gestures or calibration gestures that precede the main gesture . Initiation gestures are pre - designed for easy spotting out of continuous noisy sensor streams , so that the system activates the main recognition on - demand and reduces false - positives [ 110 ] . Examples include rotating the palm [ 10 ] , a tea pot gesture [ 141 ] , raising the forearm [ 76 ] , opening up the arm [ 155 ] , or pressing a button [ 90 , 126 ] . Users are sometimes requested to perform a calibration gesture [ 1 ] to help the system reset the accumulated error offsets . Similarly , voice - recognition systems often require a hot word [ 18 , 124 ] before the main verbal query being issued . These methods may look partly analogous to our strategy , in that the user performs a preliminary step to help the main sensing that shortly follows , but AHA differs from them in several ways . Firstly , a specific initiation / calibration gesture is tightly coupled with a certain gestural input system ; the user is asked to perform this initiation gesture whenever using the system . In AHA , an actuation is not affixed to an AI sensor ; each time , an appropriate actuation is chosen dynamically in a way that resolves the currently unfavorable human - to - AI conditions and naturally blends with the user’s context . Secondly , the user pre - learns initiation / calibration gestures and willfully performs them when instructed . In contrast , actuations expect users’ natural reactions , not necessarily pre - learned nor instructed ; ideally , the user may remain unaware that her action is actuation - induced . Thirdly , initiation / calibration gestures are extra efforts in addition to the main gestures . In AHA , actuations are conveyed by piggybacking on existing proactive interactions , minimizing the user’s extra interaction burdens . Finally , although an initiation / calibration gesture signals an upcoming main gesture and helps the sensor re - calibrate itself , the extrinsic conditions around the main gesture remain unchanged . However , the actuations of AHA aim to actively change the extrinsic conditions of the target sensing task itself . We note that actuations and initiation / calibration actions are not mutually exclusive . For example , the user says the hot word “Hey Google” and wakes up the speaker . However , she is speaking in a direction away from the speaker , getting the recognition hard . An appropriate actuation may induce her to naturally speak toward the speaker , helping to increase the reliability of speech recognition . 3 MOTIVATING EXPERIMENTS To motivate , we experimented our hypothesis that typical human - targeted visual AI models would favor an ideal condition of the target person where the model performs well , and its performance diminishes as the condition deviates from ideal . To obtain empirical results , we sampled three human - targeted visual AI models that infer the gender and age [ 146 ] and the body weight [ 6 ] of the target person . To prevent us from arbitrarily intervening in the models , we used pre - trained models as presented by their original authors . The details of each experiment are as follows . Proc . ACM Interact . Mob . Wearable Ubiquitous Technol . , Vol . 7 , No . 1 , Article 6 . Publication date : March 2023 . 6 : 6 • Cho et al . The gender model , pre - trained in UTKface dataset [ 166 ] , takes inputs of face images cropped by MTCNN [ 162 ] and infers the person’s gender . To test whether this gender model favors a certain facial orientation , we tested it on the K - Face dataset [ 22 ] , which consists of professional - grade facial photos of 1 , 000 individuals , taken systematically in a 360° photogrammetry studio [ 151 ] to capture facial photos simultaneously from numerous angles . ( a ) Gender confidence along viewing angle ( b ) Age error along viewing angle ( c ) Body weight error along distance Fig . 2 . Error and confidence scores variation on each model by different human - to - AI conditions Figure 2a summarizes the confidence trend of gender inferences varied with facial orientations . The confidence reaches its peak around the frontal view ( i . e . , 0° - 15° ) and diminishes as the viewing angle deviates to either sideways . We observe similar trends from the age model in Figure 2b . Note that this figure shows the error rates , not confidences . The trend reveals the error being at a minimum at - 30° , and growing as the viewing angle deviates . Although the minimum occurred slightly away from face - on ( 0° ) , it confirms our hypothesis that the model favors a certain ideal angle . The body weight model , pretrained in the original authors’ proprietary dataset , takes 2D images and predicts the weight of the person shown . To observe whether the model favors a certain distance between the camera and the person , we test the pre - trained model with our in - house dataset that consists of a total of 125 images of 8 individuals ( 2F 6M ; age min / mean / max : 21 . 0 / 25 . 5 / 43 . 0 ; height min / mean / max : 1 . 62 / 1 . 76 / 1 . 85 m ; weight min / mean / max : 53 . 0 / 76 . 1 / 100 . 0 kg ) standing 0 . 5 to 6 . 5 m from the camera . The test was conducted using our in - house dataset because we could not find a public dataset that had labels of both the person’s weight and distance from the camera . Still , our dataset covers a large range of body weight . Figure 2c reveals that the model achieves the minimum error of 7 % at 1 . 1 m distance ; the errors grow as the distance deviates – rapidly growing at closer distances and stay doubled or higher at farther distances . So far , all three models’ behaviors are consistent with our hypothesis , despite a myriad of other models having yet to be tested . Our experiments indicate that a visual AI model likely has a favored spatial condition of the target where the model performs best , and its performance diminishes as the condition deviates from the favored one . Conversely , our observations above support AHA – actuating the target person to change her condition to one that is favorable to the AI model would yield the inference results of better confidence or accuracy . 4 TAXONOMY OF ACTUATIONS By proposing a new approach that proactive actuations help AI sensors overcome unfavorable conditions , this paper will be exploring the guidelines of which actuation is effective for which AI sensors and for which context the person is currently in , to effectively elicit favorable conditions for that sensor given the situation and the target context . Such guidelines may be of limited applicability if they directly refer to the specific device , implementation , or contents of an actuation being experimented here . To facilitate flexible applications , we suggest a taxonomy to position each actuation type therein . Let us take an example of background music played from a surround speaker Proc . ACM Interact . Mob . Wearable Ubiquitous Technol . , Vol . 7 , No . 1 , Article 6 . Publication date : March 2023 . AI - to - Human Actuation : Boosting Unmodified AI’s Robustness by Proactively Inducing Favorable Human Sensing Conditions • 6 : 7 array . Rather than viewing it directly as a specific speaker , we have it sit in the taxonomy as a representative example of auditory actuations , ambiently embodied in the home space , that may elicit certain physical motions of the user relevant to her attention or perception . To build the taxonomy , we thoroughly reviewed literature and commercial products that present new devices , interactions , or designs targeted for interactive spaces . We performed multiple iterations to find appropriate dimensions that could effectively categorize the reviewed work , in the perspective of actuation and AI , actuation and human , and the characteristics of actuations . We describe each dimension of the taxonomy below . 4 . 1 Dimension A . Induced Human Reaction We anticipate that an actuation will induce a reaction from the target person . Many types of reaction can occur , and at levels from motor to cognitive [ 15 , 102 ] , but we first set a scope of reactions to be those that can be sensed by typical sensor types pervasive in smart environments : cameras and microphones . Within this scope , we characterize an actuation as one that may induce ( 1 ) physical movement , ( 2 ) speech , or both , from the target person . Many devices are known to induce physical movements by a person . Public interactive displays [ 2 , 14 , 44 , 97 , 142 , 159 ] induce physical movements from the pedestrians , known as honey - pot effects . Limited abilities of a robot vacuum cleaner can induce the resident to resolve obstacles or dead ends [ 33 , 35 , 127 ] . Ambient displays [ 54 , 93 ] attract attention , often changing the person’s facial orientation . Ambient lights remind the person to make physical movements for well - being [ 36 , 92 ] . Auditory nudges also result in a person’s movement [ 94 , 143 ] . These induced movements may discontinue a situation that is unfavorable to a visual AI model , e . g . , the target person getting clear of an obstructed view . Proactiveness of smart speakers has been actively studied [ 17 , 72 , 145 , 149 ] and even commercialized [ 7 , 43 ] . Smart speakers that initiate a conversation may induce both reactions – turning towards the speaker [ 85 ] and speaking , favoring both visual and audio - based AI models [ 55 , 101 ] . For example , inducing a person to speak would help AI models that opportunistically infer her non - verbal contexts , especially when it is in need of additional confirmative speech samples . Although we initially consider two categories in this dimension , considering additional types of sensor could generatively extend it . 4 . 2 Dimension B . Ambience We classify an actuation in terms of the ambience of its presence and transition . Ambient actuations leverage existing background signals and produce a slowly - progressing change , so that they are less obtrusive to the user and less interfering with her on - going context . However , its low noticeability may delay the user’s reaction . Examples of ambient actuations include subtle updates on pervasive displays [ 54 , 93 ] and a silently - changing background [ 125 ] . These changes are less salient , having a low possibility of intervening the user context . In contrast , obtrusive visual effects , e . g . , blinks indicating urgent notifications [ 93 ] , are non - ambient actuations , likely inducing an instant reaction from the user . Similarly , prominent sounds that yield the user’s instant movements [ 94 , 143 ] are non - ambient actuations . Non - ambient actuations may be invasive of the user’s on - going context . They include public displays [ 2 , 14 , 44 , 97 , 142 , 159 ] conveying an explicit cue to the user to move around or take a break [ 36 , 92 ] . Robotic appliances getting stuck in a troubling situation [ 33 , 35 , 127 ] can also be seen as non - ambient actuations , which divert the user’s attention to start remedying the robot . Proactively initiated conversations [ 7 , 17 , 43 , 72 , 145 , 149 ] both intervene the user’s context and call for an instant reaction , e . g . , responding to the speaker , thus they are seen as non - ambient actuation . Proc . ACM Interact . Mob . Wearable Ubiquitous Technol . , Vol . 7 , No . 1 , Article 6 . Publication date : March 2023 . 6 : 8 • Cho et al . 4 . 3 Dimension C . Sensory Dependence Actuations are conveyed to the user through certain sensory channels , whose momentary availability may vary and thereby affect the user’s noticeability of that actuation [ 20 , 21 , 81 ] . A well - known relevant concept is change blindness [ 64 , 132 ] , which refers to the human inability to detect environmental visual changes due to one’s attention [ 133 ] or other factors [ 41 ] . The user’s line of sight being off the display or her mind being occupied elsewhere would make it difficult for her to timely see the actuation [ 14 , 36 , 54 , 65 , 92 , 93 , 97 , 106 , 128 , 134 , 142 ] . Auditory actuations [ 7 , 17 , 43 , 94 , 143 , 149 ] are largely insensitive to the line - of - sight constraint , but their noticeability can decrease in a noisy environment . Further , a concept of change deafness [ 31 , 139 ] , similar to change blindness , has been developed . Thus , the sensory channels that an actuation utilizes influence the chances of the user’s reaction . We consider this sensory dependence as one of our taxonomy dimensions . Besides visual and auditory , other senses such as olfactory [ 106 ] or tactile feedback [ 92 , 137 ] could be used for actuations , but are beyond the scope of our study . 5 STUDY GOALS AND SCOPE In this paper , we premiere the novel concept of AHA , showcase its early embodiment , and study how it benefits the AI and influences human experiences , in a realistic living environment . As set forth in § 1 , our experimental goals are : ( 1 ) methods – prototype various methods of AHA that are feasible in upcoming smart homes ; ( 2 ) benefits – observe how such actuation bring changes to the user’s conditions and benefits the AI sensors’ performance ; ( 3 ) acceptability – understand the user perception and acceptance of the actuation being applied . Study scope . As our everyday life is increasingly surrounded by AI - backed sensors and smart devices , the applicable scope of the AHA can be vast , e . g . , home and work , mobile and public spaces . Given this vast scope and the initial nature of our concept , we focus on an exemplary , manageable - sized real - life setup and assess key factors on AI performance and human experiences . In this light , we define this initial study’s scope as follows : • Target environment is set to be a near - future smart living space ( e . g . , a home ) instrumented with pervasive displays , speakers , and vision sensors backed by human - targeted AI models that infer the resident’s various contexts . • Impact of actuation on AI output . The exerted actuation may ( or may not ) change the person’s conditions observable by the AI sensor and eventually influence the AI model’s output behaviors . We investigate the impact on the AI model’s output behaviors in quantitative terms , such as accuracy , confidence , response time , and so on . • Impact of actuation on user experience . Upon an actuation applied , a number of user experience factors would be in question . She may or may not notice the presence of actuation . If she does notice , she may or may not feel that it is obtrusive , or even annoying . If she knows the underlying intent of the actuation , she might respond differently to that actuation . We investigate the user’s noticeability , acceptability , and knowledge factors . Beyond scope . Two major agenda would lie in our AHA research : given an AI model , ( 1 ) How can we automatically determine the right timing and context to trigger an actuation , as well as the appropriate type of that actuation ? ( 2 ) Once triggered , what is the expected benefit to the AI’s performance and what might be possible side - effects on the user ? In this study , we seek answers to the 2nd - group questions . The 1st - group questions are beyond this paper’s scope . The rationales are as follows . Automating the triggering decision of an actuation requires prerequisites : the system should be able to predict the level of benefits and side - effects if an actuation is applied , taking account of the dependency on the actuation type and the current context . Now it is evident that the scope of this initial study , Proc . ACM Interact . Mob . Wearable Ubiquitous Technol . , Vol . 7 , No . 1 , Article 6 . Publication date : March 2023 . AI - to - Human Actuation : Boosting Unmodified AI’s Robustness by Proactively Inducing Favorable Human Sensing Conditions • 6 : 9 i . e . , answering the 2nd - group questions , is essentially to develop these prerequisites . We believe that this initial study will nourish the exploration of the 1st - group problems , which will be the next agenda of AHA research . We narrow the type of sensors / actuators to commercially mature audio - visual devices – home IoT cameras , smart speakers , and pervasive displays . Although the concept of AHA applies to experimental devices ( wireless , tactile , robotic , etc . ) , we leave it to future work to keep this initial study manageable - sized . For the user’s knowledge factor and possible novelty effects , this study previews these matters over a short term . A longitudinal study is reserved as a follow - up . 6 TESTBED To empirically test the AHA approach , we constructed a testbed that emulates a near - future smart living space . The goals of our testbed are to facilitate the participants’ natural home activities , to apply various actuations through the smart devices and services deployed , and to study the influences on the AI models’ output and the participants’ experiences . Fig . 3 . Testbed floorplan and device placements . Name of each camera shown in the near yellow box Figure 3 illustrates our testbed setup established in a real home , i . e . , a campus apartment , instrumented with multiple smart speakers , pervasive displays , and vision sensors . For ease of programmability , we employed smartphones as equivalent replacements of smart speakers and vision sensors ; we installed 10 smartphones , having their cameras , speakers , and microphones cover the testbed space . We also installed 3 displays – one 80 - inch projector screen and two 32 - inch LCD monitors , to emulate pervasive displays . In total , these devices function as 10 vision sensors , 2 smart speakers , 4 surround speakers , 1 ambient display ( 80 inches ) , and 2 interactive displays ( 32 inches each ) in the testbed . On top of these devices , we implemented the following services that are likely in near - future smart homes : a fake window on the ambient display , a background music player on the surround speakers , content - push services on the interactive displays , and smart - speaker services . Details of these services and the actuation deployed on them are covered in § 7 . 4 . In an isolated bedroom , we set up an administrator’s console ( Figure 4 ) providing live video feeds from all the vision sensors as well as input interfaces to trigger a smart speaker to initiate a conversation , to control the surround speakers’ volume , to change the scene on the fake window , and to switch the content of an interactive display .

Administrator’s console interfaces 7 EXPERIMENT DESIGN For experiments , we deployed multiple visual AI models to run behind the vision sensors in the testbed . We also deployed multiple types of actuations to be triggered from smart devices and services . We recruited 20 participants ( 10F & 10M ; age min / mean / max : 20 / 22 . 6 / 28 y ) through our university bulletins . The basic unit of our experiment is a session ( 60 min long ) . Each participant is invited to the testbed , asked to make herself at home for a single session . During her stay , all the vision sensors record videos from the respective angles ( Figure 3 ) and various types of actuations are given occasionally . After the session , participants are given a 30 - min semi - structured interview . To study the impact of their knowledge of actuations ( § 5 ) , 14 ( 7F , 7M ) of the 20 participants were invited to another round of experiment of the same format , conducted after a week . Each participant was compensated an amount worth USD 15 per session . They were notified of video recordings in advance and voluntarily signed a consent form . The experiment was approved by our university IRB . Details of the experiment design are as follows . 7 . 1 Participant Instructions At the 1st round , we briefed them only that the intention of our study is to explore their experiences with proactive smart devices in a near - future home . We did not mention actuation , its intent , nor mechanism . Only at the end of the interview , they were told about the real purpose ; this was to avoid potential biases that may affect the 1st - round results . To establish common experimental conditions across participants while eliciting natural home activities , we requested the participants to perform a set of 11 home activities ( listed below ) but also allowed some degree of individual flexibility . • Read books at the table • Use a laptop at the ta - ble • Sit at 3 different chairs • Write on whiteboards • Use a smartphone • Wander around • Brush the dust off • Eat fruits • Eat snacks • Make tea or coffee • Drink water The participants were asked to perform every activity at least once during the session but in any order and timing they were pleased . Personal activities are also allowed , with a list of examples given : such as using a personal device like a tablet , doing their own study , or reading papers , etc , in the intervals between the requested activities . These policies were to semi - control the activities across participants but also to let them feel relaxed and behave naturally . The requested activities are listed on the whiteboard in the testbed space . We shuffled their order every session . Before each session , we replenished supply items such as fruits , snacks , bottled water , and tea bags . Proc . ACM Interact . Mob . Wearable Ubiquitous Technol . , Vol . 7 , No . 1 , Article 6 .

AI - to - Human Actuation : Boosting Unmodified AI’s Robustness by Proactively Inducing Favorable Human Sensing Conditions • 6 : 11 7 . 2 Experiment Sessions Each session runs for 60 min , in which it switches settings – baseline and actuated . The baseline setting reflects the conventional one - way sensing . The actuated setting reflects our approach in which proactive actuations are occasionally exerted to hopefully elicit favorable human - to - AI conditions . In both settings , all vision sensors record videos and make continuous inferences . We collected a total of 420 h of video from all cameras × sessions × participants . A session starts in the actuated setting , then quietly switches to the baseline , then quietly back to the actuated setting . Each setting runs for 20 min . All switches are performed quietly without notifying the participant . During the total 40 min of actuated setting , more than 10 actuation instances ( 2 + per actuation type , with a minimum 3 + min of gap between consecutive actuations ) are triggered in a Wizard - of - Oz manner ( § 7 . 5 ) . As discussed in § 5 , automated AHA is beyond the scope of this paper ; this paper is to fulfill the prerequisite to move on to that stage . 7 . 3 AI Models Deployed We consider human - targeted visual AI models that could be pervasively deployed on commodity home IoT products such as networked RGB cameras [ 9 , 29 , 42 , 123 ] . Although such AI models are diverse , we curate a few exemplary models to showcase the efficacy of our approach . To help our model choices be representative of a large spectrum of human - targeted vision applications , we systematically sampled the following three families . • Human face detection provides a versatile primitive for many vision applications , e . g . , inferring identity , emotion , age , gender , etc . In our experiment , we select a face detector , MTCNN [ 162 ] , to serve as such a common primitive . • Human whole - body sensing enables useful applications . Health applications would be of special interest in smart homes , such as inferring one’s weight , activity , motor diseases , etc . We select Detectron2 human pose estimator [ 150 ] as a basic model , and also a weight estimator [ 6 ] as an applied model . • Human - object interaction ( HOI ) often serves as a lens to understand the human’s rich context . We employ an HOI detector , CDN [ 161 ] , that jointly detects a human , the object under interaction , and the verb label that indicates her activity with that object . HOI is a useful primitive for home automation , such as illuminating or ventilating . 7 . 4 Actuations Deployed We deployed 5 types of actuation that could benefit visual AI models suffering from unfavorable orientation , distance , or occlusion ( Figure 5 ) . They operate on the pervasive displays and smart speakers in the testbed , and proactively generate changes or engage the user through audio - visual channels . Note that our actuations were largely adopted from proactive interaction literature ( § 2 . 2 and § 4 ) , rather than designed from scratch . It was our purposeful decision to have our experiments focus on our key questions – exploring the AI benefits and user experiences with proactive actuations that complement AI sensors . Creating a brand new proactive interaction may have extra merits , but will multiply the number of independent variables to validate , and dilute our focus . Table 1 lists our classifications of the five actuations according to the taxonomy in § 4 . Below , we describe the details of how each actuation operates and what factors govern the operation . • Ambient visual + auditory effects from a fake window ( 𝐷 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 ) : Pervasive displays have been studied for ambient home services , e . g . , a fake window or a digital photo frame [ 26 , 148 ] with auto - changing content . Adopting such , we implemented 𝐷 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 - type actuations – a fake window service in the ambient display and speakers . It shows occasional smooth transitions so that the user may naturally turn toward them . We implemented visual transitions of snowing , turning on / off the lamp , and a time - lapse of an outdoor landscape . We also implemented slow audio transitions of bird - chirping and bonfires . Given their mild changes , we Proc . ACM Interact . Mob . Wearable Ubiquitous Technol . , Vol . 7 , No . 1 , Article 6 . Publication date : March 2023 . 6 : 12 • Cho et al . Table 1 . Classification of deployed actuations Induced Human Reaction Ambience Sensory Dependence Face Body Speech Ambient Non - ambient Visual Auditory Actuations 𝐷 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 O O O O 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 O O O 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 O O O O 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 O O O O 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 O O O O O O expected that the actuation of 𝐷 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 type would exhibit relatively low obtrusiveness , drawing the person’s reaction in an un - or semi - conscious manner . • Subtle changes in spatial volume of surround speakers ( 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 ) : An intelligent music player would proactively change the spatial volume distribution , adaptive to the person’s context [ 45 , 143 , 168 ] . Adopting such , we deployed 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 - type actuations that slowly change the volume of either side of 4 surround speaker units . It slightly and slowly increases the volume on one side ; then after a while , slowly decreases it back to the original volume . Due to its gradual change , we expected that the actuation of 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 type would yield a mild , unawarely reaction . • Proactive visual information delivery from interactive displays ( 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ) : Inspired by content - adapting displays that respond to the user’s distance and orientation [ 5 , 137 , 142 , 159 ] , we expect that the converse would function as actuation – inducing the user to change her distance or orientation in response to proactively - changing information . 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 - type actuation works as follows . By default , the interactive display shows a natural background . When triggered , it silently switches to an indication of a news update available . As the actuation is audio - free , she may not notice it immediately . When she moves closer , more details of the news gradually appear until she reaches the distance favored by the whole - body AI models ( human pose estimator [ 150 ] and weight estimator [ 6 ] , § 7 . 3 ) . Once she stops interacting , or if she does not notice the actuation for 3 minutes , the display reverts to the default state . We expected that this type of actuation would require conscious attention from the user , as she explicitly interacts with the display . • Proactive auditory information delivery from a smart speaker ( 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 ) : When addressed , people usually turn towards the caller ; this property is often utilized in smart speakers [ 85 , 118 ] . Leveraging such human responses and the proactive voice - assistant literature [ 17 , 25 , 72 , 144 , 145 ] , we deployed 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 - type actuation that the smart speaker proactively initiates a conversation . Compared to 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 , we expected that 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 would exhibit a higher level of attention and interruption , due to the verbal cues being instantly perceivable regardless of the user’s line - of - sight . • Proactive audiovisual information delivery from both devices ( 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ) : This type of actuation extends 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 by adding the smart speaker , for audiovisual information update to induce a more prompt change of the user’s distance or orientation . We expected it to bring combined effects of 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 and 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 . 7 . 5 Actuation Triggering Criteria To regularize how to trigger actuations in a Wizard - of - Oz setting , we defined a set of protocols that were agreed upon by the researchers who administered the sessions . Each protocol is a chain of determining : ( 1 ) an unfavorable condition , ( 2 ) cameras that suffer from that condition , ( 3 ) a candidate actuation ( s ) to trigger , and ( 4 ) the induced human reaction ( Table 2 ) . Eligible unfavorable conditions were defined based on literature ( § 2 . 1 ) and found in our motivation ( § 3 ) – a participant whose face is invisible or seen sideways , staying against a camera , whose body is partly occluded or totally out of a camera’s field of view ( FoV ) .

According to the protocols above , two researchers first observe all cameras , then shortly agree to an eligible unfavorable condition and its associated actuation candidate ( s ) . If multiple types of candidates exist , they prioritize the least - triggered type . At least 3 minutes of separation is ensured between consecutive actuations . Once the researchers agree , they manually trigger the agreed actuation ( Figure 4 ) . One researcher makes annotations along the experiment timeline . 7 . 6 Post - session Interviews We interviewed participants about general experiences in the actuated environment , e . g . , level of comfort , any unusual or memorable action of a device , etc . Then we asked how they felt upon an actuation triggered , what information was delivered , whether they intentionally did not respond to it , and to guess the number of actuations that had been triggered . For each actuation type the participant noticed and remembered , we asked them to evaluate their experience quantitatively ( in 7 - point Likert scale ) and qualitatively in four user experience attributes : { Awkward , Disturbing , Interesting , Useful } . The first two attributes are to explore the negative impact with that type of actuation , Proc . ACM Interact . Mob . Wearable Ubiquitous Technol . , Vol . 7 , No . 1 , Article 6 . Publication date : March 2023 . 6 : 14 • Cho et al . which may trade - off with the improvement of AI performance . The later two are to investigate the positive impacts with that type of actuation . For missing actuation types that they did not mention , we gave a hint , e . g . , “ Have you noticed the volume change of the background music ? ” Our interview protocol was that , only if they recall that type of actuation , we repeat the aforementioned quantitative and qualitative questions . No participant recalled missing actuation types despite our hints . 8 RESULTS We organize our results as follows . To outline , § 8 . 1 summarizes the basic statistics . Then , we present the results from two perspectives – AIs and humans . Firstly , § 8 . 2 investigates the AI - side benefits and impacts . Specifically : • Actuation has been applied to on - going AI inference . Does it bring improvement ? ( § 8 . 2 . 1 ) • AIs may be doing good or bad before the actuation . Does the actuation bring improvement anyway ? ( § 8 . 2 . 1 ) • The temporal responses . How does AI performance change along time upon an actuation applied ? ( § 8 . 2 . 2 ) • Do we observe overall improvement in the actuation settings over the baseline settings ? ( § 8 . 2 . 3 ) • Between 1st and 2nd rounds , do we observe any meaningful change of AIs’ performance ? ( § 8 . 2 . 4 ) Secondly , § 8 . 3 reports the human factors with AI - to - human actuations . Specifically , we find : • The participants’ experiences in actuated environments , in terms of quantitative ratings . ( § 8 . 3 . 1 ) • The participants’ experiences in actuated environments , in terms of qualitative responses . ( § 8 . 3 . 2 ) • The participants’ behaviors in actuated environments : rate of reactions to the actuations applied . ( § 8 . 3 . 3 ) • Between 1st and 2nd rounds , did their behaviors and experiences change ? ( § 8 . 3 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Basic Statistics of the Experiments Table 3 provides a comprehensive summary of our experiment results organized in two major dimensions , as follows : • Performance Improvement dimension tabulates the improvement in each AI model’s inference quality upon an actuation applied , shown in either increasing confidence score ( MTCNN , CDN , Detectron2 ) ∗ or decreasing MAE ( Weight ) . Each cell shows the quality value observed in the after - actuation period , followed by the difference amount from the before - actuation period , and a bar chart for visibility , juxtaposing after - and before - actuation quality bars . • User Acceptance dimension represents the participants’ subjective ratings of the actuated environment in four UX attributes . A high rating in Interesting and Useful , and a low rating in Awkward and Disturbing would be indicative of positive acceptance . Ratings are color - coded for visibility , such that ( blue , yellow , red ) = ( 7 . 0 , 4 . 0 , 1 . 0 ) for Interesting and Useful , and ( 1 . 0 , 4 . 0 , 7 . 0 ) for Awkward and Disturbing . Table 3 separately lists the all - round results , as well as the 1st - and 2nd - round results for between - round analysis ( § 8 . 2 . 4 , § 8 . 3 . 4 ) . Note that the all - round results include all participants ( 𝑁 = 20 ) , whereas the round - specific results include only the participants who joined both rounds ( 𝑁 = 14 ) . Therefore , the all - round results are not necessarily the average of both round - specific results . This is to perform a fair comparison between rounds by only considering comparable pairs of sessions , as we try to investigate possible knowledge factors ( § 5 ) . This convention consistently applies to the round - specific results presented afterward . Table 4 summarizes the number of actuations triggered in all 34 sessions , their breakdown into each actuation type , and per - session average . The distribution of actuation types across sessions did not differ significantly . Once an actuation is triggered , it is activated for the transition effect duration ( e . g . , 𝐷 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 ) or until the partic - ipant responds and completes two - way interactions ( e . g . , 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ) . Figure 6 shows the durations . 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ∗ Confidence scores ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] by default . For Detectron2 , we show the sum of scores in 17 joints – each score is known to be unbounded [ 4 ] . Proc .

Visualizing all actuation instances : Before - actuation confidence ( X - axis ) vs . After - actuation confidence ( Y - axis ) had the longest duration with the largest min - max range due to its silent , visual - only change , resulting in long latencies until the participants notice . 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 had a shorter duration , as the actuation includes both auditory and visual effects . Other actuation types lasted shorter , because they are one - way actuations not waiting for the user reaction . Figure 7 shows the annotated activities that the participants were doing , at the baseline setting and at the moment of an actuation triggered . Overall , the activity distribution was a good mixture of the requested pre - defined activities and the suggested free activity examples . Note that the seemingly uneven distribution is due to different amounts of time spent per activity . The distributions do not differ significantly across participants , indicating that each experiment session was under modestly similar conditions in terms of the participant’s activities . 8 . 2 AI Perspective : Benefits and Impacts from Actuations Does applying an actuation to on - going AI inference bring improvement ? We begin with this central question in exploring the efficacy of AHA , in quantitative quality metrics of confidence levels or error amounts in AI inference . Proc . ACM Interact . Mob . Wearable Ubiquitous Technol . , Vol . 7 , No . 1 , Article 6 . Publication date : March 2023 . AI - to - Human Actuation : Boosting Unmodified AI’s Robustness by Proactively Inducing Favorable Human Sensing Conditions • 6 : 17 8 . 2 . 1 Comprehensive Results : How Many Actuations Bring How Much Improvement on AI Inferences ? Figure 8 reports comprehensive results that actuations do benefit on - going AI inference quality . Each dot represents a single actuation instance . The X - axis means the peak confidence in the 20 - second period immediately before an actuation triggered ( hereinafter before - actuation period ) . The Y - axis means the peak confidence in a variable - length period immediately after the actuation triggered ( hereinafter after - actuation period ) . The cut - off time for the latter is variable as we take into account only the period the participant actively reacts to the actuation . § 8 . 2 . 2 details the cut - off time distribution . Once a participant ends her actuation - relevant reaction , the AI’s performance is no longer tracked . Given the definition of X - and Y - axes , the dots inside the upper - left triangle represent the number of actuations which brought positive changes in the AI performance . Overall , 92 . 1 % of actuations brought improvement . A key finding is that an improvement could occur over almost the entire range of before - actuation conditions , not just before - actuation condition was poor . We investigated the other 7 . 9 % of cases where actuations brought negative changes . Many of those occurred when the participant was standing or too close to the camera ; her induced reaction , slightly approaching to the camera , resulted in her face outside from the camera’s FoV . A preventive measure may be to set peripheral margins of the FoV and to set the interior as actuation - eligible , so that she likely remains inside the FoV after reacting . Another prevention would be to apply actuations only if a before - actuation confidence threshold is not met , i . e . , ‘do not actuate when already good - enough’ . Our results indicate that a threshold of 0 . 95 will prevent 46 % of these negative changes , and a threshold of 0 . 85 would prevent 54 % of them . 8 . 2 . 2 Temporal Responses : How AI Performance Changes over Time upon an Actuation ? § 8 . 2 . 1 confirmed that actuations do change the on - going AI performance , mostly positively . Now we investigate how such changes gradually appear ( and disappear ) along time – for a time range spanning the before - and after - actuation periods ( defined in § 8 . 2 ) . For space - saving , we visualize the continuous traces from select actuation types and beneficiary sensors . Other actuation - sensor combinations exhibit similar temporal trends . Figure 9 and 10 plot the trends of confidence scores for the face ( MTCNN ) and body pose ( Detectron2 ) models , respectively . Figure 11 plots the trend of body weight estimation errors ( in kg ) . The figures represent the momentary distribution of confidence scores ( or errors ) every 10 - second interval . Vertical orange lines indicate the moment when actuation is triggered . Each figure accompanies a blue area plot at the top , representing the number of unfinished actuation instances being counted in each violin plot along time . Recall that , for each actuation issued , we stop tracking the performance once the participant finishes actuation - induced reactions . The above results disclose that it takes a while until the AI inference quality reaches meaningful improvement since an actuation was triggered . To our empirical observation , this ‘response time’ seemed to be influenced ( a ) 𝐷 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 , Ceiling Center ( b ) 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 , Partition Center Fig . 9 .

CDF of response times at 2D pose estimation ( 2nd round ) by diverse human factors , e . g . , individuals’ different sensitivity to gradual sound changes or change blindness . Still , a bounded response time is preferable for practical applications . To this end , we present Figure 12 and 13 that shows the mainstream CDFs representing the time for the growing confidence to exceed a certain level of threshold . At face detection , it takes ≤ 23 s until 80 % of the actuation instances to exceed a confidence of 0 . 7 , and ≤ 24 s until 70 % to exceed 0 . 9 . For pose estimation , 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 and 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 took 28 s and 98 s , respectively , for 70 % of the actuation instances to exceed a confidence of 8 . 0 . The results show that most response times are within 20 to 30 s in our actuation embodiment , except 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 which show longer response times in inducing body movements . 8 . 2 . 3 Between Settings : AI Performance between Baseline vs . Actuated Settings . Table 5 compares the average performance in the entire baseline settings vs . in the after - actuation periods of actuated settings , per model per vision sensor . Overall , for most AI models and sensors , actuations yield improvement not only over the before - actuation periods but also over the average baseline settings ( which is today’s conventional setting ) . The only exception is for the whiteboard - calendar ( WC ) camera with the face model ( MTCNN ) , where the actuated setting exhibits slightly lower confidence . After a thorough investigation of the raw videos , we verified that this sole exception is due to the WC camera’s low - height installation ( 1 m above the floor ) . Coincidentally , if an actuation is applied when the participant is at a specific location , this low - height view makes a tricky condition that may cause obstruction of the participant’s face . We believe that the low - height installation of WC may prefer a different actuation to induce a favorable reaction , such as one that induces the person to step back from the current location . 8 . 2 . 4 Between Rounds : AI Performance between 1st vs . 2nd Rounds . Now we investigate possible performance differences between rounds ( i . e . , 1st → 2nd ) attributable to novelty or knowledge effects . Referring back to Table 3 , Proc . ACM Interact . Mob .

Likert scale distributions of each user experience attribute the Performance Improvement dimension separately compares 1st - and 2nd - round results . Although the before - actuation confidences ( or errors ) sometimes vary between rounds , we observe that after - actuation performances are rather similar between the 1st and 2nd rounds . This result implies that the observable effectiveness of our actuation strategies may not be heavily affected by the participants’ knowledge or novelty factor that would likely change between rounds . 8 . 3 Human Perspective : Experiences and Behaviors in Actuated Environment How did the users perceive the actuated environment ? How did they behave ? Here we report the participants’ post - session interview results . For the 7 - pt Likert - scale questions , we report their ratings per actuation type , per user experience attribute . For the qualitative questions , three researchers coded each response , grouping them by actuation type and user experience attribute ( § 7 . 6 ) . Then , they iteratively clustered the codes into high - level themes . The example quotes presented in this paper are representative of the broad themes grounded in our data [ 23 ] . We annotate each statement in ( Participant , Actuation type , User context ) format . Participant label is in either F 𝑛 or S 𝑛 format , indicating the f irst round and the s econd round , respectively . 𝑛 is the participant ID . Actuation type and User context labels are optionally given when a statement is related to a particular type and context . When we asked the participants how they felt about the environment , most of them responded they were comfortable . ( F06 ) : “I felt if I were in a cozy study cafe . ” ( F01 ) : “It felt like my dormitory room . ” We asked if they were familiar with smart devices , what type of devices they have used . A smart speaker was the dominant response . ( F12 ) : “I’m currently using a smart speaker called Kakao Mini , to schedule an alarm , to play music , and to ask about the weather . ” We asked if they recall memorable actions . Every participant included 1 + non - ambient actuations . Few mentioned the surround speaker ( 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 ) although it was an ambient type , because the default volume of background music was set somewhat high . ( F09 , 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 , Reading a book ) : “I wished the background music was quieter when reading a book . But it became louder . ” Proc . ACM Interact . Mob . Wearable Ubiquitous Technol . , Vol . 7 , No . 1 , Article 6 . Publication date : March 2023 . 6 : 20 • Cho et al . 8 . 3 . 1 Participants’ Experiences : Quantitative Ratings . We asked participants to rate their experiences over four user experience attributes : “How { awkward , disturbing , interesting , useful } did you feel the actuated environment ? Please rate your experience ( 1 : not at all , 7 : definitely ) . ” Figure 14 depicts their rating distributions . Overall , their negative feelings seemed marginal , supported by low ratings on the negative attributes , i . e . , Awkward ( 𝜇 = 2 . 62 , 𝜎 = 1 . 58 ) and Disturbing ( 𝜇 = 2 . 56 , 𝜎 = 1 . 78 ) on a 7 - pt scale . For Disturbing , they rated 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 least disturbing ( 𝜇 = 1 . 42 , 𝜎 = 0 . 92 ) , followed by 𝐷 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 ( 𝜇 = 2 . 27 , 𝜎 = 1 . 46 ) . They felt neutral with 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ( 𝜇 = 3 . 52 , 𝜎 = 1 . 81 ) and 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 ( 𝜇 = 3 . 18 , 𝜎 = 1 . 78 ) . For Awkward , 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 was rated neutral , i . e . , ( 𝜇 = 3 . 22 , 𝜎 = 1 . 91 ) . Ratings of the awkwardness of the other four actuation types were similarly low , i . e . , 2 . 24 - 2 . 82 . We will reason this observation in § 8 . 3 . 2 . The participants highly rated the positive attributes , i . e . , Interesting ( 𝜇 = 4 . 95 , 𝜎 = 1 . 55 ) and Useful : ( 𝜇 = 4 . 75 , 𝜎 = 1 . 85 ) . For Interesting , 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 ( 𝜇 = 5 . 52 , 𝜎 = 1 . 10 ) and 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ( 𝜇 = 5 . 61 , 𝜎 = 1 . 07 ) were the top two . Given their familiarity with smart speakers , they found the ‘proactive’ property interesting ; ( S12 , 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 ) : “ It was interesting that the speaker starts a conversation on its own . ” For Useful , the non - ambient types were rated highly , i . e . , 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ( 𝜇 = 5 . 79 , 𝜎 = 1 . 04 ) , 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ( 𝜇 = 5 . 33 , 𝜎 = 1 . 29 ) , 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 ( 𝜇 = 5 . 39 , 𝜎 = 1 . 04 ) . In contrast , the ambient types were rated neutral , i . e . , 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 ( 𝜇 = 3 . 85 , 𝜎 = 2 . 32 ) , 𝐷 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 ( 𝜇 = 3 . 55 , 𝜎 = 1 . 83 ) . The high usefulness of non - ambient actuations seemed mainly attributed by the rich and explicit information delivery , e . g . , ( S10 , 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ) : “ It told me about a news headline and also I could see the details . I think it is quite useful . ” Overall , we observed a high average rating ( 4 . 85 / 7 . 00 ) from the two positive UX attributes and a low average rating ( 2 . 61 / 7 . 00 ) from the two negative UX attributes . We reason such results by analyzing their responses below . 8 . 3 . 2 Participants’ Experiences : Qualitative Responses . Although the results in § 8 . 3 . 1 indicate the overall levels of the participants’ awkward or disturbing experiences are low , we investigate the minority samples that they felt otherwise . Figure 14a shows 𝐷 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 and 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 rise at higher Awkward ratings . They came from those who wondered about the cause of changes ; ( F07 , 𝐷 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 ) : “Suddenly I heard some bird - chirping and bonfire ; I wondered why that happened . ” ( F12 , 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 , Using a phone ) : “I couldn’t figure out why the volume went up ; I wondered if I did something wrong . ” Actuation types of auditory elements seem likely correlated with the degree of Awkward or Disturbing . Some participants compared 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 and 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 in pair , assessing that visual - only actuations were far less disturbing than the combination of visual and auditory . ( F05 , 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 , Using a phone ) : “ [ 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ] is like air . It feels like the information was just floating there” We found that human context may vary the degree of awkward or disturbed . ( S04 , 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 , Reading a book ) : “I felt [ smart speaker initiating a conversation ] disturbing as I was reading a book . It’d have been no problem if I was cleaning the room . ” ( F11 , 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 , Drinking tea ) : “I was just drinking tea ; no serious thoughts . It was good to get a news pushed . ” In our interviews , the participants expressed various levels of affinity with proactive speakers . Some felt proactive smart speakers natural ; their high affinity seemed correlated with low Awkward ratings . ( S05 , 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 ) : “Technologies develop rapidly . I expected smart home devices would do such [ proactive operations ] soon . ” Still , many took a proactive smart speaker as an exotic experience , rating highly on Interesting but also on Awkward . ( F18 , 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 ) : “It was refreshing . ” ( F07 , 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 , Reading a book ) : “I was alone , and the speaker suddenly talked to me . It was awkward . ” 8 . 3 . 3 Participants’ Behaviors : Reaction Rates . We now analyze reaction rates , i . e . , the ratio of actuation instances which participants turned to or moved toward the source ( Table 6 ) . 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 type marked the highest reaction rate ( 95 . 89 % ) in inducing the participant to turn her face . 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 was the second highest ( 87 . 65 % ) . Not surprisingly , Proc .

Cross - referencing with Figure 14b , the results imply a trade - off between reaction rates and potential disturbance . 8 . 3 . 4 Participants’ Experiences : Comparison between 1st and 2nd Rounds . For the 14 participants who joined both rounds , we performed paired t - tests between their 7 - pt Likert scale ratings in the 1st and 2nd rounds . In Table 3 , the User Acceptance dimension shows marginal mean score differences between rounds or insufficient statistical significance . Only two pairs were of statistically significant differences : from Awkward attribute for 𝐷 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 ( 1 . 58 → 2 . 50 , 𝑝 = 0 . 04 ) and from the Interesting attribute for 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 ( 2 . 89 → 4 . 56 , 𝑝 = 0 . 04 ) . Both are the ambient actuation type . Qualitative responses support that the differences came from the participants’ knowledge about the actuators’ operations . A few 1st - round responses mentioned 𝐷 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 , specifically wondering why the sound effect transitioned ( e . g . , crackling bonfire , bird chirping ) . After they had learned from the 1st - round interviews , they tended to perceive the transitions more often in the 2nd round , possibly leading to an elevated Awkward level . Nonetheless , the absolute scores of Awkward remained at the lower end of the 7 - pt scale , implying that the overall user - perceived awkwardness was not high . Similarly , the 2nd - round resulted in more participants newly recognizing the change in ambient sound volume . 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 , 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 , and 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 exhibited interesting trends in the 2nd round , despite insufficient statistical significance . The scores on Awkward and Disturbing tended to decrease where Interesting and Useful pre - dominantly increased . We speculate that the participants , who were little familiar with the proactive interaction in the 1st round , were getting used to them and appreciating them . ( S11 , 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ) : “At the 1st round , it was kinda weird asking me if I want to know the news . But now I know I can decide which to hear or not . ” ( S03 , 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ) : “Now I know the display varies the details based on my distance . ” We also analyzed potential differences in the participants’ reaction rates between rounds , for each pair of same - type actuations . None of the pairs exhibited statistically significant changes . However , it is noteworthy a slight decrease in 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 ( 43 . 18 % → 36 . 96 % ) , due to a few participants in the 2nd - round feeling less intention to react . ( S07 , 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 ) : “I feel no need to turn as I already know the changes” Overall , the results so far exhibit positive implications towards lasting effects of AHA . Still , we stress that deriving a more conclusive assessment of potential novelty or knowledge effects would require extended deploy - ments . 8 . 4 Context Preserving Actuations We used a Human - Object Interaction ( CDN ) model to check whether the participants’ context changed across the moment of an actuation . For every second , one’s most plausible behaviors ( e . g . working on the computer , sitting , standing , etc . ) were inferred independently from all cameras . Then , the top - scored label was selected as the behavior at that second . We separately aggregated these labels for the before - actuation period and for the after - actuation period , then determined the representative behavior in each period . Table 7 lists the rate of behavior label changes across periods . Proc . ACM Interact . Mob . Wearable Ubiquitous Technol . , Vol . 7 , No . 1 , Article 6 . Publication date : March 2023 . 6 : 22 • Cho et al . Table 7 . The percentage ( % ) of changing behavior per actuations between before the actuation and after the actuation Actuations 𝐷 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 12 . 73 % 6 . 82 % 45 . 16 % 16 . 18 % 35 . 29 % The result indicates that an actuation of 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ( 35 . 29 % ) or 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ( 45 . 16 % ) type has a higher chance of changing the participant’s behavior context , compared to other types of actuations ( 6 . 82 % - 16 . 18 % ) . This result is not surprising , because 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 and 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 induce the person to eventually walk towards the interactive display . Inspecting every single behavior - change with either 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 or 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 , more than 70 % were the changes from ‘sit’ → ‘stand’ . For other actuation types , most were the same , i . e . , ‘work on the computer’ → ‘sit’ . Note that these two behavior labels are not mutually exclusive . These results suggest two implications . Firstly , an actuation of 𝐷 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 , 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 , or 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 is highly likely ( i . e . , 83 . 82 % - 93 . 18 % ) to preserve the user’s behavioral context . Secondly , even in the few cases that do change the behavior , the actual change may not be necessarily a big jump in semantics . 9 DISCUSSION 9 . 1 AI - to - Human Actuation Guidelines We experimented various practical aspects of our actuation approach , including performance improvement , user experience and acceptance . We derived the following guidelines to facilitate informed applications of AHA in real - life . • Use non - ambient auditory actuations to expect the highest reaction rate of face turns . Our analysis reveals over 80 % of reaction rates upon 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 and 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 actuations ( Table 6 ) . Given their obtrusiveness , however , one may exercise this guideline as a last resort when other actuation types are inapplicable or unsuccessful . • Avoid non - ambient actuations when the person is engaged in a non - trivial activity . Our study reveals non - ambient actuations introduce varying levels of obtrusiveness depending on the user’s on - going activity ( § 8 . 3 . 2 ) . Expect she may accept non - ambient actuations with less disturbance when her engagement is low . • Incorporate causality implications in ambient - type actuation designs . Our unexpected finding was that a few participants rated 𝐷 𝑎𝑚𝑏𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 - and 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 - type actuations awkward despite their ambient property ; a major reason was the unclear cause of changes ( § 8 . 3 . 2 ) . Notably , some participants attempted to correlate their contextual behaviors with such changes , e . g . , ( F06 , 𝑆 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 ) : “The volume has increased because I read a book . ” We recommend designing ambient - type actuations that imply causality , even though it is illusive . • Choose an actuation type that is less influential to the human context that the AI captures . We found that actuations inducing physical relocation ( 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 and 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ) likely change the HOI context ( § 8 . 4 ) . Given the human context of the AI’s interest , choose an actuation type whose expected human reaction is orthogonal to the target context or of low probability to influence it . Refer to empirically measured probabilities such as Table 7 . • Prioritize visual - only actuations in non - urgent situations . Visual - only actuation , 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 , has been found to exhibit low disturbance but take varying delays until being noticed . If the application can tolerate a delayed improvement of the inference quality , consider visual - only actuation as a primary choice ( § 3 ) . • Consider an actuation with interactive displays for long retention of favorable facial orientation . The two - way nature of 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 and 𝐷𝑆 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 yields an actuation that lasts longer than the others ( Figure 6 ) , indicating extended retention of favored facial orientation . If the beneficiary AI model prefers a continuous view of the target’s face [ 56 ] , an actuation type involving interactive displays would be a priority consideration . Proc . ACM Interact . Mob . Wearable Ubiquitous Technol . , Vol . 7 , No . 1 , Article 6 . Publication date : March 2023 . AI - to - Human Actuation : Boosting Unmodified AI’s Robustness by Proactively Inducing Favorable Human Sensing Conditions • 6 : 23 • Consider individual differences in affinity with specific actuators : Our experiments discovered individ - uals’ varying affinity with the proactiveness of smart speakers ( § 8 . 3 . 2 ) . If available , take into account the prior of the user’s personal affinity with an actuation - specific property in the process to choose an appropriate actuation type . 9 . 2 Acceptance of AI - to - Human Actuation In interviews , we discussed the general acceptability of the actuated environment and the number of actuations . For the general acceptability , most participants responded positively in three perspectives : ( 1 ) actuations are perceived as natural near - future home devices’ actions . ( ( F01 ) : “ I think I would live with these devices in near future . ” ) ; ( 2 ) actuations are perceived as a kind of care . ( ( F05 ) : “ The environment took care of me at the right level of not interrupting my concentration . ” ) ; ( 3 ) actuations become more familiar . ( ( S11 ) : “ I felt the environment comfortable , and didn’t mind actuations being triggered . ” , ( S03 ) : “ I think I can stay here longer ” ) . Overall positive user experiences ( § 8 . 3 . 1 ) and a trend of decreasing awkward and disturbing for non - ambient actuations ( § 8 . 3 . 4 ) support these responses . Also , two participants who initially reported 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 negatively did not report so in the 2nd round . These trends imply that people may accept actuated settings as a future smart home and become familiar as they continue to co - exist with them . Most participants replied that the number of actuations was moderate and comfortable . Interestingly , three in the 2nd round noticed fewer actuations than in the 1st round , though the numbers were the same . A few wanted more actuations , e . g . , 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 , when they are bored , doing nothing , or wandering around . In contrast , one in the 2nd round , who had negatively responded about the acceptability , suggested that lowering the frequency of 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 would increase the acceptability of the environment . These responses are analogous with the varying affinity of 𝑆 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 and the human context factors ( § 8 . 3 . 2 ) . Although the above results provide overall positive implications , it is important to note the occasional negative user experiences derived from actuations . As reported in § 8 . 3 . 2 , we found few participants feeling ambient actuations awkward , looking for the cause of the changes . Non - ambient auditory actuations were sometimes reported to be more disturbing , due to their obtrusive nature , than other types . Participants also reported varying levels of disturbance depending on their contexts . Still , they opened a room for making actuations positive to them , such as correlating their context with ambient actuations and being willing to have non - ambient auditory actuations when they are not busy . Additionally , almost all participants called for customizations in non - ambient actuations , relating the content to their real - life ( F08 , 𝐷 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 ) : “ It would be much more useful if the information is about my schedules or memos . ” Putting together our findings , our suggested setup could be a good starting point for most people , but the type and the number of actuations could be tailored to the person , and also to her growing familiarity with the actuated setting . Furthermore , we hope our guidelines ( § 9 . 1 ) provide insights when designing and triggering actuations to diminish the reported negative experiences and increase the acceptability of the actuated setup . 9 . 3 Limitations 9 . 3 . 1 User - control and Customization of Actuator Devices . Our experiment did not allow the participants to control or reconfigure the actuator devices . In a real home , however , the resident has a full ownership and thus control of the devices , e . g . , stopping the music when watching a movie . It would be a next - step milestone to devise dynamic actuation mechanisms that adapt to the user - controlled device status and auto - extract a viable actuation therein . 9 . 3 . 2 Manual Administration of Actuation - triggering . Automatically determining an actuation - demanding sit - uation and the right type of actuation is beyond the scope of this paper ( § 5 ) . Our findings will shed light on Proc . ACM Interact . Mob . Wearable Ubiquitous Technol . , Vol . 7 , No . 1 , Article 6 . Publication date : March 2023 . 6 : 24 • Cho et al . developing the logic , cost metrics , and input variables to automate determination of the timing and type of an actuation to trigger . 9 . 3 . 3 Experiments Focused on Single - person Smart Home . We acknowledge that the eventual scope of AHA will extend to multi - personal spaces . In near future , public spaces would be rich in AI sensors and actuators that respond to various contexts of passers - by [ 2 , 5 , 28 , 51 , 52 , 57 , 71 , 86 , 87 , 112 ] . We envision that the basic principles of AHA would be applicable to such spaces and benefit the AI sensors therein , although the embodiment of individual actuations may differ . Furthermore , multi - personal social context needs to be considered when estimating the awkwardness or the context changes due to actuation [ 88 ] . The literature on the social dimension of human interruptibility may provide guidance [ 34 , 49 ] . 9 . 3 . 4 Actuation May Influence Target Context . As discussed in § 9 . 1 , there would be varying degrees of influence relationship between the type of target context and the type of actuation being exerted . Static contexts such as body weight and identity , are certainly invariant . Dynamic contexts such as mood or activities may or may not change upon actuation . For dynamic , the chance of a change would be actuation type - dependent ( § 8 . 4 ) . A similar trend could be expected with mood ; an actuation type with high surprise may result in a momentary facial change . The response time may be another variable ; the user’s context would likely change as the response time increases . We call for a further study on deriving an informed model specializing in the actuation - to - context influenceability . 9 . 3 . 5 Long - term Deployment . It is an open question how the effect of actuations would last over time . As the users learn about the mechanism , they may become sensitized to subtle actuations . Or , as they get used to the actuated environment , novelty effects may diminish . For initial explorations , we performed two rounds of experiments ; most metrics remained similar between rounds ( § 8 . 2 . 4 , § 8 . 3 . 4 ) . Still , extended deployments would be needed to derive concrete answers . 9 . 4 Mini - experiment on Resource - efficient Practical Perception of Unfavorable Conditions Before concluding , we ask ourselves about a premise to make AHA work automatically – existing AI models not only sense the original human context ( e . g . , gender , facial expressions ) but also perceive an additional context indicating the current unfavorable condition , if any ( e . g . , sideways facial view to the left ) , at minimal complexity growth . This ability would advise the automated system of the directionality of a promising actuation . Say that a facial emotion network additionally infers one’s facial orientation being off - ideal by 45° to the left . This may be a hint to the system to choose an actuation that originates from her right side . We admit it is not comprehensive enough to cover diverse choices of available actuations , but it may halve or narrow down the set of actuations to choose from . To show its feasibility , we added a lightweight branch - network to our gender classification model so that it additionally estimates an actuation - demanding condition ( i . e . facial angles ) . We explored a total of 9 branch - networks , trained with K - Face dataset [ 22 ] . Table 8 specifies the two top - performing branch - networks . Both had very small MAEs ( < 4° ) , but their sizes differ greatly – 2 . 3M vs . 66k parameters , given the baseline model having 6 . 0M . Obviously , resource - hungry home AI products would strongly favor the second architecture as its complexity growth is only 1 % of the baseline . Although our branch - network resulted in acceptable error rates with marginal complexity growth , we do not generalize this single case ; thorough verification is beyond the scope of this mini - experiment . However , our approach is consistent with the practice of transfer learning [ 104 , 160 ] ; our observation may not necessarily be a lucky outlier . We deployed the baseline and its branched - out model on a Raspberry Pi 4 . Table 9 compares the latencies . The branched - out model demonstrates the feasibility of extra estimation of an unfavorable condition at negligible latency increase ( 1 . 09 - 2 . 36 % ) . Proc . ACM Interact . Mob .

We presented a systematic exploration in terms of methods , benefits , and acceptance of AHA . We instrumented a testbed in a real apartment with rich sensors , actuators , human - targeted visual AIs , and proactive smart home agents , where various types of actuation were embodied . Our experiments with 20 participants resulted in 34 1 - hour - long sessions , 468 instances of actuation applied , and 420 - hour - long videos . We assessed AHA in terms of AI accuracy , confidence , response time , as well as human noticeability , acceptability , and knowledge factors . We anticipate that our initial findings call for the community’s interest in further deepening proactive actuation strategies for synergistic AI - empowered human living space and provide a new perspective on human - AI interaction .
