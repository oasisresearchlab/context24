We show here that , independently of their role in endocytosis , endophilin - A1 and endophilin - A2 regulate exocytosis of neurosecretory vesicles . The number and distribution of neurosecretory vesicles were not changed in chromaf ﬁ n cells lacking endophilin - A , yet fast capacitance and amperometry measurements revealed reduced exo - cytosis , smaller vesicle pools and altered fusion kinetics . The levels and distributions of the main exocytic and endocytic factors were unchanged , and slow compensatory endocytosis was not robustly affected . Endophilin - A ’ s role in exocytosis is mediated through its SH3 - domain , speci ﬁ cally via a direct interaction with intersectin - 1 , a coordinator of exocytic and endocytic traf ﬁ c . Endophilin - A not able to bind intersectin - 1 , and intersectin - 1 not able to bind endophilin - A , resulted in similar exocytic defects in chromaf ﬁ n cells . Altogether , we report that two endocytic proteins , endophilin - A and intersectin - 1 , are enriched on neurosecretory vesicles and regulate exocytosis by coordinating neurosecretory vesicle priming and fusion . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14993 - 8 OPEN 1 European Neuroscience Institute — A Joint Initiative of the University Medical Center Göttingen and the Max Planck Society Göttingen , Göttingen , Germany . 2 University of Copenhagen , Department for Neuroscience , Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences , Copenhagen , Denmark . 3 Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology , University of Coimbra , Coimbra , Portugal . 4 Leibniz Research Institute for Molecular Pharmacology , Molecular Physiology and Cell Biology Section , Berlin , Germany . 5 Department of Clinical Genetics , Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research , Amsterdam UMC , Amsterdam , The Netherlands . 6 Institute for Cellular Biochemistry , University Medical Center Göttingen ( UMG ) , Göttingen , Germany . 7 These authors contributed equally : Sébastien Houy , Johanna G .

Following exocytosis , endocytosis rapidly retrieves the exocytosed vesicle membrane and proteins . While the two processes are tightly coordinated , the molecular mechanisms underlying such coupling are not well understood 1 – 3 . Endophilin - A ( henceforth endophilin ) , one of the best - characterized endocytic adaptors , is known to orchestrate various steps in clathrin - mediated endocytosis in mice , ﬂ ies , and nema - todes 4 – 12 . Endophilin acts as the hub of a protein network that coordinates membrane remodeling , cargo sorting , actin assembly , bud constriction as well as the recruitment of factors needed for ﬁ ssion and / or uncoating 13 , 14 . Endophilin was also proposed to have a central role in clathrin - independent endocytosis 15 – 17 , and in ultrafast endocytosis 18 . Vertebrates express three endophilins enco - ded by three genes : SH3GL2 ( endophilin 1 , brain - enriched ) , SH3GL1 ( endophilin 2 , ubiquitous ) , and SH3GL3 ( endophilin 3 , brain - and testis - enriched ) . The three endophilin proteins have redundant functions and a similar structure : they contain an N - terminal Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) - domain that senses and induces mem - brane curvature , and a C - terminal SH3 - domain that mediates pro - tein interactions ( e . g . , with dynamins , synaptojanin - 1 ) 4 , 5 , 12 , 19 . Along with the well - established role in endocytosis , several indications point to additional roles for endophilin at the neuronal synapse . ( i ) Endophilin was shown to undergo an association - dissociation cycle with the synaptic vesicles ( SVs ) and to be delivered to the periactive zone by exocytosis in the worm ’ s nerve terminal 19 . ( ii ) Endophilin interacts with SV - resident vesicular glutamate transporter 1 ( vGLUT1 ) 20 , 21 , SV - associated synapsin 22 , and intersectin - 1 23 , a conserved scaffold protein that was suggested to couple exocytosis and endocytosis 24 , 25 . In addition to its well - established role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis and actin dynamics , intersectin - 1 has also been implicated in exocytosis , and it localizes at exocytic sites in neurosecretory PC12 cells and adrenal chromaf ﬁ n cells 26 – 30 . ( iii ) The vGLUT1 - endophilin - A1 interaction regulates the SV organization and spontaneous release at the murine hippocampal synapses 31 . ( iv ) Murine hippocampal neurons missing all three endophilins showed impaired SV recy - cling , a reduced number of SVs and altered neurotransmission 12 . However , it is not clear whether the impaired neurotransmission in neurons lacking endophilins results from defective endocytosis and SV recycling , or from endophilin ’ s role in exocytosis , or both . Here , we show that endophilin is directly involved in the reg - ulation of exocytosis , independently of its endocytic roles . While exocytic and endocytic processes are tightly coupled at the neu - ronal synapse , such coupling is less prominent in neurosecretory cells , given that the large dense - core vesicles ( LDCVs ) originate from the trans - Golgi network and undergo a long maturation ( minutes to hours ) before they fuse with the plasma membrane 32 . Thus , we employed adrenal chromaf ﬁ n cells , a well - established model to study calcium - regulated exocytosis , given that these cells use similar molecular machinery as neurons 33 , 34 . After LDCVs fuse with the plasma membrane in chromaf ﬁ n cells , an orchestrated process of compensatory endocytosis ef ﬁ ciently removes the added membrane and proteins , and delivers them to a near - Golgi area , a process that takes tens of minutes 35 . We found that chromaf ﬁ n cells , like neurons , contain mRNAs for all three endophilins . Thus , we employed chromaf ﬁ n cells obtained from endophilin A1 , A2 , and A3 triple knock - out ( TKO ) mice described in Milosevic et al . 12 to decipher the role of endophilin in exocytosis . Results Endophilin - A is enriched at neurosecretory vesicles . Adrenal chromaf ﬁ n cells contain numerous LDCVs that release their content into the blood by fast exocytosis 34 . To check if endo - philins 1 – 3 are expressed in chromaf ﬁ n cells , we looked for the presence of the corresponding mRNAs and proteins . Firstly , RNA was isolated from cells extracted from the adrenal medulla obtained from wild - type ( WT ) and endophilin TKO P0 mice ( TKO mice die a few hours after birth ) . All three endophilin mRNAs were detected by real - time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) in the WT ( endophilin 2 signal was the most prominent ) , but not in the TKO samples ( Suppl . Fig . 1a ) . Next , western blots revealed the presence of endophilin 1 and endophilin 2 in the adrenal gland homogenate from WT mice , whereas these pro - teins were absent in the glands obtained from TKO mice ( WT - wild - type , KOWTKO - endophilin 1 − / − - 2 + / + - 3 − / − , TKO - endophilin 1 − / − - 2 − / − - 3 − / − ; Suppl . Fig . 1b ) . Endophilin 3 , the least abundant member of the endophilin family in the brain 12 , could not be detected by western blotting in the adrenal gland homogenate ( Suppl . Fig . 1b ) . Based on overexpression studies , endophilins are primarily cytosolic proteins that associate with membranes in various cells 12 , 36 – 38 . However , studies of native protein distributions are limited due to the lack of speci ﬁ c antibodies . We characterized two custom - made anti - endophilin antibodies and tested their speci ﬁ city on the KO cells . These antibodies gave almost no staining in endophilin TKO chromaf ﬁ n cells ( Fig . 1a , b , right panels ) . Interestingly , in WT cells endophilin 1 - and endophilin 2 - speci ﬁ c signals were partially punctate and reminiscent of signals obtained with LDCV markers , e . g . , chromogranin - A ( CgA ) ( Fig . 1a , b , left panels ) . When chromaf ﬁ n cells were co - immunostained for CgA and endophilin 1 ( or endophilin 2 , respectively ) , a signi ﬁ cant colocalization between CgA and endophilins was detected ( Suppl . Fig 1c , d ; the values were corrected for accidental colocalization ) . The enrichment of endophilin 1 and endophilin 2 on CgA - positive secretory vesicles was even more obvious on isolated plasma membranes generated by “ unroo ﬁ ng ” cultured chromaf ﬁ n cells by a single sonication pulse 39 , 40 . Membrane sheets with attached secretory vesicles have been used previously to study the principles of vesicle release on the plasma membrane 41 , 42 . Plasma membrane sheets were subsequently co - immunostained for CgA and endophilins ( Fig . 1c , d ; endophilins are also involved in endocytosis at the plasma membrane , so it can be expected that a fraction of endophilin 1 , or 2 , do not colocalize with CgA - positive LDCVs ) . We further inspected the distribution of endophilin 1 and 2 in chromaf ﬁ n cells upon stimulation ( by 59 mM KCl buffer ) . Interestingly , a signi ﬁ cant enrichment of endophilin 1 and endophilin 2 - speci ﬁ c signals near / at the plasma membrane was detected upon stimulation ( Fig . 1e , f , graphs below images show the line - intensity pro ﬁ les ; quanti ﬁ ed in Fig . 1g , h ) . In sum , endophilin - speci ﬁ c signal was present on majority , but not all CgA - labeled vesicles and it translocated to the plasma membrane upon stimulation . The occurrence of endophilin on LDCVs is unexpected , in particular in the light of two decades long research on this protein family . The function ( s ) of endophilin on neurosecretory vesicles and in exocytosis are entirely unknown . Endophilin - A promotes exocytosis in chromaf ﬁ n cells . To investigate whether endophilins have a role in exocytosis , we performed fast measurements that combined membrane capaci - tance and amperometry recordings on chromaf ﬁ n cells of endo - philin TKO mice and corresponding littermate control ( henceforth endophilin KOWTKO or KWK ; note that a direct comparison to WT was not possible since the strain was con - stitutive knockout for endophilin 1 and 3 , thus , C57BL6 / J WT mice from a separate mouse line were used as an additional ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14993 - 8 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 1266 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14993 - 8 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications c d a b WT TKO WT TKO endo A 1 endo A 2 C g A C g A O v e r l a y O v e r l a y e n do A 1 endo A 2 CgA Overlay i k j l m n o W T Resting Distance ( pixels ) 0 200 200 0 250 250 High K + High K + W T EndoA2 Distance ( pixels ) 200 0 200 0 Resting 250 250 EndoA1 e f g h I n t .

The chromaf ﬁ n cell cultures were prepared from adrenal glands at P0 and used between 2 and 4 days - in - vitro ( DIV ) for experiments . Capacitance and amperometry measurements were performed on a Ca 2 + - calibrated setup as follows : each cell was loaded via a patch pipette with the photo - labile Ca 2 + - chelator nitrophenyl - EGTA and the two Ca 2 + - dyes ( Fura - 4F and Furap - tra ) to enable accurate measurements of intracellular calcium concentrations ( [ Ca 2 + ] i ) . Photolysis of caged Ca 2 + compound increased [ Ca 2 + ] i from several hundred nanomolar to above 10 μ M , resulting in robust exocytosis , which was assayed by an increase in membrane capacitance and amperometric current , one cell at a time . The measured increase in membrane capaci - tance is proportional to the change in chromaf ﬁ n cell plasma membrane surface area , while simultaneous amperometric recordings allowed the measurement of secreted catecholamines during the exocytic events 34 , 39 , 43 . Remarkably , both capacitance and amperometry measurements from endophilin TKO chro - maf ﬁ n cells revealed reduced exocytosis ( 340 ± 36 fF ) when compared to the littermate control ( 501 ± 30 fF for KOWTKO ) and WT ( 484 ± 40fF ) mice after the ﬁ rst stimulation ( Fig . 1i , j , shaded gray area indicates WT ) . Notably , exocytosis from endophilin KOWTKO cells was comparable to that of WT cells originating from several different C57BL / 6 - based strains that have been recorded over the years 44 – 50 . Analysis of capacitance measurements revealed a reduction in the exocytic burst at 1 s following uncaging ( 189 ± 25 fF in TKO vs . 299 ± 22 fF in KOWTKO and 315 ± 16 fF in WT , Fig . 1k ) and the sustained component ( 151 ± 16 fF in TKO vs . 202 ± 14 fF in KOWTKO and 176 ± 12 fF in WT ; Fig . 1l ) . Further analysis of the exocytic burst revealed that both readily releasable pool ( RRP ) and slowly releasable pool ( SRP ) sizes ( obtained from the amplitudes of triple - exponential ﬁ ts to the capacitance traces ) were signi ﬁ cantly smaller ( 78 ± 15 fF in TKO vs . 142 ± 13 fF in KOWTKO and 135 ± 10 fF in WT ; 54 ± 10 fF in TKO vs . 91 ± 11 fF in KOWTKO and 97 ± 7 fF in WT , respectively ; Fig . 1m ) . The fusion kinetics of the RRP vesicles from the TKO cells ( time constants of the exponential ﬁ ts ) was sped up ( 9 . 0 ± 1 . 0 ms in TKO vs . 12 . 1 ± 1 . 0 ms in KOWTKO and 10 . 9 ± 0 . 9 in WT ; Fig . 1n ) . Curiously , we found that the RRP time constant correlated with the RRP size ( Suppl . Fig . 1e ; also noted in synaptotagmin - 7 KO 47 ) . The kinetic parameter of the SRP was not signi ﬁ cantly altered with the group size tested ( Fig . 1o ) . Altogether , these data indicate that endophilin controls the size of the releasable pools and rate of RRP vesicle fusion . Similar results were found upon a second stimulation applied 100 s after the ﬁ rst stimulation ( Suppl . Fig . 1f – i ; a small exocytic response following the second stimulation in the TKO cells prevented reliable exponential ﬁ tting , thus the vesicle pool and kinetic analyses could not be performed ) . The ratio between second and ﬁ rst burst release was not changed ( Suppl . Fig . 1j ) , suggesting that the vesicle pools , although smaller , could be ef ﬁ ciently re ﬁ lled between the two stimuli . To test if the exocytic phenotype is speci ﬁ c , and to examine the contribution of individual endophilins to chromaf ﬁ n cell secretion , we re - introduced full - length endophilin 1 , or endophi - lin 2 ( Suppl . Fig . 2a ) , in endophilin TKO cells using a bicistronic lentiviral system , and performed electrophysiological measure - ments as before . First , we generated lentivirus and veri ﬁ ed the expressions of endophilin 1 and 2 by western blotting ( Suppl . Fig . 2b ; HEK - 293 cells were used here since lentivirus - infected primary chromaf ﬁ n cells in culture do not yield enough material to perform a western blot ) . The lentivirus was then employed to infect primary chromaf ﬁ n cells in culture : the co - expression of enhanced green ﬂ uorescent protein ( EGFP ) through the IRES system was used to identify transduced cells ( Suppl . Fig . 2c ; proteins were on average expressed at similar levels ) . Remarkably , the expression of either endophilin 1 or endophilin 2 rescued the exocytic defects in TKO cells ( Fig . 2a , b ; note that the secretion from chromaf ﬁ n cells derived from littermate controls was comparable to the secretion of C57BL6 / J WT cells ; Fig . 1i ) . Both burst and sustained exocytic components were ef ﬁ ciently rescued by either endophilins ( burst : 221 ± 28 fF for endophilin 1 and 292 ± 43 fF for endophilin 2 vs . 137 ± 15 fF measured in endophilin TKO ; sustained : 190 ± 23 fF for endophilin 1 and 178 ± 20 fF for endophilin 2 vs . 92 ± 24 fF in endophilin TKO ; Fig . 2c , d ; shaded gray area indicates littermate control ) , and so were the RRP size ( Fig . 2e ) and the fusion kinetics of the RRP ( Fig . 2f ) . The kinetics of the SRP were unchanged when either endophilin 1 or 2 were expressed ( Fig . 2g ) . Similar results were noted upon a second stimulation ( Suppl . Fig . 2d – g ) . Notably , the releasable pools were recovered ef ﬁ ciently between two stimuli that were 100 s apart , as revealed by an unchanged ratio between second and ﬁ rst burst ( Suppl . Fig . 2h ) . Altogether , these data reveal that the effect of endophilin on exocytosis was speci ﬁ c , and that the expression of either endophilin 1 or 2 was suf ﬁ cient to support exocytosis in chromaf ﬁ n cells . To inspect whether chromaf ﬁ n cells without endophilin show changes in single - vesicle fusion events , we performed a thorough examination of single amperometric spike parameters from endophilin TKO cells and compared them to TKO cells expressing endophilin 2 . Here , secretion was elicited by loading chromaf ﬁ n cells in whole - cell mode with low - calcium intra - pipette solution , as detailed in Pinheiro et al . 48 . Representative amperometric traces for endophilin TKO and endophilin TKO expressing endophilin 2 are shown in Fig . 2h ; the analyzed properties of single spikes are illustrated in Fig . 2i . Signi ﬁ cant differences were observed in the number of detected events per cell ( Fig . 2j ) , single spike charge ( calculated as the time integral of the amperometric current ; re ﬂ ects the total amount of catecho - lamines oxidized at the electrode ) and amplitude ( Fig . 2k , l ) — all these parameters were found to be decreased in endophilin TKO cells , while the kinetic features of single spikes were not changed ( Fig . 2m – o ) . Amperometric spikes are often preceded by a pre - spike foot that re ﬂ ects catecholamine leakage through the forming fusion pore 51 . The pre - spike foot duration was not altered , but its amplitude was smaller in endophilin TKO cells ( Fig . 2p , q ) , further supporting the notion that endophilin participates in LDCV fusion . In addition to the capacitance measurements that allow analysis of exocytosis of the whole chromaf ﬁ n cell on the millisecond time scale and the amperometric measurements that report directly on catecholamine release , we employed an imaging - based assay that capitalizes on synaptotagmin - 7 - pHluorin ( Syt - 7 - pHluorin ) and synaptotagmin - 1 - pHluorin ( Syt - 1 - pHluorin ; pH - sensitive LDCV - resident probes ) to independently inspect exocytosis in this model system ( Suppl . Fig . 2i ) . We expressed Syt - 7 - pHluorin , or Syt - 1 - pHluorin , in chromaf ﬁ n cells using lentivirus and assayed vesicle release upon stimulation ( 59 mM KCl ) , and in the presence of the endocytosis inhibitor Pitstop - 2 ( Suppl . Fig . 2j – n ) 52 . We found that endophilin TKO cells expressing Syt - 7 - pHluorin ( Suppl . Fig . 2j – k ) , or Syt - 1 - pHluorin respectively ( Suppl . Fig . 2l – n ) , showed a lower number of ﬂ uorescent puncta that appeared upon stimulation compared to WT and littermate controls , thereby con ﬁ rming that the loss of endophilins in chromaf ﬁ n cells impairs exocytosis . Taken together , these data strongly suggest that endophilin has a direct role in exocytosis by regulating the fusion of secretory vesicles and the size of the releasable vesicle pool . LDCV numbers are not altered in the absence of endophilin - A .

To distinguish between these possibilities , we performed com - prehensive ultrastructural studies by electron microscopy ( EM ) and 3D - confocal imaging . Ultrastructural EM analyses were performed on cultured chromaf ﬁ n cells and adrenal glands . Independently of whether chromaf ﬁ n cells were analyzed in culture or gland , we noted that the overall LDCV morphology in endophilin TKO cells was comparable to controls ( WT and littermate endophilin KWK cells ) ( Fig . 3a and Suppl . Fig . 3a ) . The average number of LDCVs per cell , as well as their sizes , were not signi ﬁ cantly different between endophilin TKO , control littermates and WTs ( Fig . 3b , c and Suppl . Fig . 3b – d ) . This observation rules out the possibility that endophilin affects exocytosis by altering the number of LDCVs . The number of docked vesicles was also not altered ( Fig . 3d ) , nor was the distribution ( distance from the plasma membrane ) of LDCVs in endophilin TKO cultured cells in comparison to controls ( Fig . 3a bottom panels , Fig . 3e , f ) . In chromaf ﬁ n cells from adrenal glands , however , LDCVs were distributed further away from the plasma membrane in comparison to controls ( Suppl . Fig . 3e – g ) , and less LDCVs were found within 10 nm from the plasma membrane ( Suppl . Fig . 3f ) . Yet , this mild phenotype was observed only in chromaf ﬁ n cells in intact glands , and not in the cultured chromaf ﬁ n cells , where the exocytic defect was seen by electrophysiological measurements . The ultrastructural analysis was further complemented by two independent approaches : 3D - confocal microscopy and western blotting . First , WT , endophilin KOWTKO , and TKO chromaf ﬁ n cells were immunostained with the cargo marker CgA , and the whole cell ( acquired through z - stacks ) was imaged by the Zeiss Airyscan confocal system . Representative images are shown in Fig . 4a . Quanti ﬁ cation of CgA - positive LDCVs in the whole - cell volume revealed similar numbers of LDCVs in endophilin TKO and controls ( Fig . 4b ) . Concordantly , the levels of CgA protein were not altered in endophilin TKO adrenal gland homogenates ( Suppl . Fig . 4a , b ) . Altogether , the reduced exocytosis in chromaf ﬁ n cells without endophilin was not a result of the altered vesicle number , morphology or cargo ( i . e . , CgA ) amount . The exocytic protein machinery is not altered in chromaf ﬁ n cells without endophilin - A . The reduced exocytosis in endo - philin TKO cells occurs at the milliseconds - to - seconds time scale . Endophilins , being major endocytic proteins , could have an indirect effect on the LDCV composition and / or membrane and protein recycling processes in chromaf ﬁ n cells . Despite the overall abundance of LDCVs and the unaltered morphology of individual LDCVs in endophilin TKO chromaf ﬁ n cells , it is possible that some LDCVs may not be able to undergo exocytosis due to changes in accessory factors required for exocytosis . Speci ﬁ cally , SNAREs , Sec1 / Munc18 ( SM ) - proteins , Munc13s and other exo - cytic proteins may not be ef ﬁ ciently recycled from the previous rounds of exocytosis , or properly displayed on LDCVs in the absence of endophilin . Therefore , we checked the abundance and distribution of key exocytic proteins in endophilin TKO cells by immunocytochemistry ( ICC ) , western blotting , and real - time qPCR . As an exemplary exocytic protein , we ﬁ rst analyzed the abundance and distribution of synaptotagmin - 1 ( Syt - 1 ) , a Ca 2 + - sensor important for LDCV exocytosis in chromaf ﬁ n cells ( Fig . 4c – e ) . We immunostained endophilin TKO , littermate control KOWTKO and WT cells for Syt - 1 , and noticed that neither distribution ( Fig . 4c , d ) , nor protein levels ( Suppl . Fig 4a , b ) , of Syt - 1 were altered in endophilin TKO cells . We next checked whether proper amounts of Syt - 1 are present on LDCVs by quantifying the intensity of Syt - 1 signal on the CgA - positive structures ( through ICC ) . The analysis showed no statistical difference of Syt - 1 intensity on CgA - positive puncta between WT and endophilin TKO cells ( Fig . 4e ) . We further inspected protein levels of Syt - 1 , synaptophysin , key SNAREs ( SNAP - 25 , syntaxin - 1 , synaptobrevin - 2 / VAMP2 ) and Munc18 - 1 in adrenal gland homogenates by western blotting , and found no signi ﬁ cant difference between endophilin TKO cells and controls ( littermate endophilin KOWTKO and WT samples were used as controls ; Suppl . Fig . 4a – d ) . Also , a number of exocytic proteins , namely SNAP - 25 , synaptobrevin - 2 / VAMP2 , Munc18 - 1 and Syt - 7 revealed no signi ﬁ cant changes by immuno ﬂ uorescence in protein level and distribution in endo - philin TKO chromaf ﬁ n cells ( Fig . 4f , g ) . We also inspected the mRNA levels of several genes encoding cargo , exocytic proteins and proteins known to play a role in LDCV formation and / or maturation . RNA was isolated from adrenal medulla obtained from WT and endophilin TKO P0 mice , and subjected to real - time qPCR . No difference was observed in the mRNA levels of chromogranin - B and dopamine - ß - hydroxylase ( DBH ; LDCV cargo proteins ) , Syt - 1 , synaptotagmin - 4 , synapto - brevin - 2 / VAMP2 and VAMP4 ( LDCV - resident proteins ) , vacuolar ATPase subunit V 0 a , syntaxin 6 and syntaxin 16 ( important for LDCV formation and / or maturation ) ( Suppl . Fig . 4e ) . Taken together with the unchanged number of LDCVs , these data suggest that the reduced catecholamine release in the absence of endophilin is likely a consequence of endophilin ’ s direct action in exocytosis . Endocytic defects in chromaf ﬁ n cells without endophilin - A . Endophilin TKO cells show an unaltered number of LDCVs , a normal distribution and abundance of the key exocytic proteins , yet , it is possible that altered endocytosis may affect exocytosis in chromaf ﬁ n cells . While exocytosis is well studied in this model system , endocytic modes are far from understood . Two tempo - rally and mechanistically distinct forms of endocytosis have been reported : rapid endocytosis that depends on dynamin - 1 and GTP , and slow endocytosis that involves dynamin - 2 and clathrin 53 , 54 . We predominantly studied slow ( presumably clathrin - mediated ) endocytosis since it is not known to which extent these cells undergo fast local recycling . We examined the protein levels and distributions of the main endocytic factors , namely clathrin heavy chain ( HC ) , adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) , adaptor protein 180 ( AP180 ) , dynamins 1 , 2 , and 3 ( detected by pan - anti - dynamin antibody ) by immuno ﬂ uores - cence analysis and western blotting . Except for clathrin - HC whose levels were mildly elevated in the absence of endophilin ( by ICC analysis only , Fig . 5a ) , we detected no difference in the overall levels of the aforementioned proteins , both by quantifying immuno ﬂ uorescence in chromaf ﬁ n cells ( Fig . 5a ) and western blotting of adrenal gland homogenates ( Fig . 5b ) . In addition , the distribution of AP2 and dynamin was unaltered in endophilin TKO cells ( Fig . 5a ) . The slow endocytic recycling process in chromaf ﬁ n cells was tested by three approaches : the uptake of transferrin - Alexa Fluor TM 546 ( A546 ; clathrin - dependent ) , membrane marker mCLING - Atto647 and recombinant cholera toxin subunit B ( CT - B ) - Alexa Fluor 594 ( A594 ; clathrin - dependent and - inde - pendent ) . First , we looked at the 10 min - uptake of transferrin - A546 by analyzing whole - cell volume of endophilin TKO , littermate control KOWTKO and WT cells . There was no signi ﬁ cant difference between WT and endophilin TKO cells , while , uncharacteristically , endophilin KOWTKO cells displayed ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14993 - 8 6 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 1266 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14993 - 8 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications higher levels of internalized transferrin - A546 than WT and TKO ( Fig . 5c , d ) . We further inspected the uptake of mCLING - Atto647 that binds to the plasma membrane and whose internalization can be readily monitored for minutes 55 ( Suppl . Fig . 5a and Supplementary Movie 1 shows stimulated chromaf ﬁ n cells ; for more information on the assay characterization see Supplemental data ) . We ﬁ rst characterized the speci ﬁ city of mCLING uptake in chromaf ﬁ n cells by stimulating cells with high potassium in the presence of Pitstop - 2 ( clathrin coat formation inhibitor ) and found that this inhibitor blocked the uptake of mCLING ef ﬁ ciently ( Suppl . Fig . 5b and Supplementary Movie 2 — note that the cell surface increases upon stimulation since endocytosis was blocked ) . When mCLING - Atto647 was applied to chromaf ﬁ n cells without endophilin , a mild uptake delay was observed in the ﬁ rst 2 – 3 min , but at 8 min similar numbers of internalized vesicles ( mCLING - positive structures ) were detected in endophilin TKO and controls ( WT and endophilin KOWTKO cells ) ( Fig . 5e , f ; Supplementary Movie 3 and Supplementary Movie 4 ) . A comparable result was obtained with the uptake of CT - B - A594 , which is also internalized by both clathrin - mediated and clathrin - independent endocytosis ( Suppl . Fig . 5c , d ) . In summary , these data indicate that potential endocytic defects in the absence of endophilin cannot account for the observed effect on exocytosis in this model system .

To get mechanistic insights on how endophilin regulates the exocytic process , we looked at the function of endophilin domains : BAR - domain and SH3 - domain . In nematodes , it has been shown that endophilin ’ s BAR - domain is necessary and suf ﬁ cient to mediate its role in endocytosis 19 , while in mammalian cells both domains were needed 12 . We ﬁ rst tested whether endophilin ’ s BAR - domain alone ( i . e . , endophilin without SH3 - domain ) is suf ﬁ cient to support exocytosis in chromaf ﬁ n cells . We expressed endophilin 1 BAR - domain and endophilin 2 - BAR - domain respectively ( Fig . 6a ; expressed with EGFP through the bicistronic IRES - expression system : the expression levels of all tested proteins were comparable ; Suppl . Fig . 6e ) in endophilin TKO cells , and performed capacitance and amperometry measurements as before . Interestingly , expression of endophilin 1 or endophilin 2 - BAR - domain did not result in a rescue but rather in a further reduction of secretion from endo - philin TKO cells , either during the ﬁ rst ( Fig . 6b – e ) or the second stimulus ( Suppl . Fig . 6a – d ) . The small responses revealed an overall decrease in exocytosis , including both burst and sustained component ( Fig . 6c – e ) . This dominant - negative effect reveals that the SH3 - domain - mediated functions are important for endo - philin ’ s role in exocytosis , and that the full - length protein is needed to support exocytosis in chromaf ﬁ n cells . Endophilin ’ s role in exocytosis is mediated via intersectin - 1 . Endophilin ’ s SH3 - domain is known to mediate its interaction with several proteins , yet only two of them have been implicated in chromaf ﬁ n cell exocytosis : dynamins 56 – 58 and intersectin - 1 26 – 28 , 30 . Distribution and levels of dynamins were not altered ( Fig . 5a , b ) , as detailed before . Curiously , while levels of intersectin - 1 ( ITSN - 1 ) , a membrane - associated protein that coordinates exocytic and endocytic vesicle traf ﬁ c , were comparable ( Suppl . Fig 7a , b ; both short and long isoform of ITSN - 1 are shown ) , the distribution of ITSN - 1 was altered in chromaf ﬁ n cells lacking endophilins ( Fig . 7a ; the line - intensity pro ﬁ le through the depicted cells is shown below the images ) . Upon stimulation , ITSN - 1 was recruited to the plasma membrane in WT cells ( Supplementary Movie 5 and Fig . 7a ) , as originally reported by Malacombe et al . 26 . However , this redis - tribution did not happen in endophilin TKO cells ( Fig . 7a , b ) . A detailed examination in resting chromaf ﬁ n cells revealed that the fraction of ITSN - 1 on the plasma membrane was higher in the TKO compared to the WT ( Fig . 7b and Suppl . Fig . 7c , d ) . Similar observations were made with intersectin - 2 ( Fig . 7c , d and Suppl . Fig . 7e , f ) . In sum , the cellular distribution of intersectin - 1 and intersectin - 2 in chromaf ﬁ n cells was altered ( 1 ) after stimulation and ( 2 ) in the absence of endophilins . To check if this effect is speci ﬁ c , we attempted to rescue the ITSN - 1 distribution by expressing either endophilin 1 or endophilin 1 - Δ ITSN ( endophilin 1 E329K + S336K mutant that does not bind ITSN - 1 23 ) in endophilin TKO cells . Upon endophilin 1 expression in TKO cells , the distribution of ITSN - 1 resembled the protein distribution in WT cells ( as detected by immunostaining — Fig . 7e , compare to Fig . 7a , quanti ﬁ cation in Fig . 7f ) . Curiously , the expression of mutant endophilin 1 - Δ ITSN did not have the same effect , and ITSN - 1 was still mislocalized ( Fig . 7e , f ) . These data suggest that the endophilin - intersectin interaction is important for intersectin ’ s distribution in chro - maf ﬁ n cells and that it regulates intersectin ’ s access to the plasma membrane where vesicle priming and fusion happens . Given that the expression of endophilin 1 in endophilin TKO cells rescued exocytosis when inspected by combined fast capacitance and amperometry measurements ( Fig . 2a – g ) , we tested whether the same effect could be achieved by expressing the [ C a 2 + ] i ( μ M ) Time ( s ) I A m p ( p A ) Δ C m ( f F ) Q A m p ( p C ) 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 TKO TKO + EndoA1 - BAR TKO + EndoA2 - BAR TKO + EndoA2 - FL d e b c Stimulus # 1 40 30 20 10 0 5 4 3 2 1 0 500 400 300 200 100 0 40 30 20 10 0 40 30 20 10 0 a EndoA2 - FL 368 1 N - BAR SH3 EndoA1 - BAR 290 1 N - BAR EndoA2 - BAR 290 1 N - BAR * * * * 0 200 400 600 800 T K O T K O + endo A 1 - B A R T K O + endo A 2 - B A R T K O T K O + endo A 1 - B A R T K O + endo A 2 - B A R 0 100 200 300 400 B u r s t Δ C m ( f F ) T o t a l Δ C m ( f F ) * * T K O T K O + endo A 1 - B A R T K O + endo A 2 - B A R S u s t a i ned Δ C m ( f F ) * * 0 200 400 600 Fig . 6 Endophilin BAR - domains are not suf ﬁ cient to mediate chromaf ﬁ n cell exocytosis . a Schematic depicting the domain structure of endophilin 2 and two mutants lacking the SH3 domain expressed in the subsequent experiments . b Exocytosis induced by calcium uncaging in endophilin TKO chromaf ﬁ n cells ( red traces ) compared to TKO cells expressing either endophilin 1 BAR domain ( yellow traces ) , endophilin 2 - BAR domain ( green traces ) or full - length endophilin 2 WT protein ( gray traces ) .

The expression of endoA1 - Δ ITSN through the bicistronic lentiviral system was tested ﬁ rst in HEK - 293 cells ( Suppl . Fig . 7i ) . Remarkably , endophilin 1 - Δ ITSN was neither able to fully rescue exocytosis ( Fig . 7g – j ) , including the burst and sustained component , nor the size and time constants of vesicle pools ( Fig . 7k – m ) . Thus , endophilin ’ s role in exocytosis is mediated , at least in part , through its interaction with intersectin - 1 . Intersectin ’ s role in exocytosis is mediated via endophilin . Similar to endophilin , ITSN - 1 was redistributed in the chromaf ﬁ n cells upon stimulation . Further , we found both ITSN - 1 and intersectin - 2 ( ITSN - 2 ) to be enriched on puri ﬁ ed LDCVs ( Suppl . Fig . 7g , h ) and endophilin 1 and 2 colocalized signi ﬁ cantly with ITSN - 1 at the isolated plasma membranes ( Suppl . Fig . 7k , note that both endophilins and intersectins have multiple interactors and functions at the plasma membrane , thus , a complete overlap of signals cannot be expected ) . Like endophilin TKO chromaf ﬁ n cells shown here , intersectin - 1 KO chromaf ﬁ n cells were reported to display exocytic defects 26 , 27 . To investigate the importance of the endophilin - intersectin interaction for chromaf ﬁ n cell exocytosis , we took the complementary approach . We generated an ITSN1 mutant that does not bind endophilin 1 ( ITSN1 Δ endo ) by introducing two - point mutations ( W949E and Y965E , according to Pechstein et al . 23 ) in the SH3B domain of ITSN1 , and veri ﬁ ed the lack of interactions by a pull - down experiment ( Fig . 8a ) . We then expressed either the ITSN1 WT protein , or the endophilin - binding de ﬁ cient ITSN1 Δ endo mutant in the ITSN1 KO background using lentiviral transduction . The expression of ITSN1 WT and ITSN1 Δ endo via the bicistronic lentiviral system was comparable ( Suppl . Fig . 7j ) . While the ITSN1 WT protein rescued secretion in ITSN1 KO chromaf ﬁ n cells , the ITSN1 - Δ endo mutant was not able to fully rescue exocytosis to WT level ( Fig . 8b – g ) . Speci ﬁ cally , burst release and sizes of vesicle pools were rescued by expressing ITSN1 WT , but not ITSN1 Δ endo ( Fig . 8c , e ) , which mimics the phenotype of endophilin 1 Δ ITSN . The sustained component was not different between ITSN1 KO cells expressing ITSN1 WT and ITSN1 Δ endo ( Fig . 8d ) . Expression of either ITSN1 WT or ITSN1 Δ endo did not alter the kinetics of the releasable pools ( Fig . 8f , g ) . In sum , intersectin ’ s role in exocytosis is mediated predominantly through its interaction with endophilin . Overall , we observed that the exocytic defects in chromaf ﬁ n cells without endophilin depend on endophilin ’ s interaction with intersectin , while the exocytic defects in ITSN1 KO chromaf ﬁ n cells depend on intersectin ’ s interaction with endophilin . There - fore , we conclude that the functional intersectin - endophilin interaction coordinates exocytosis in chromaf ﬁ n cells . Discussion The ﬁ rst reports on endophilin linked its function to endocytosis 4 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 11 . Over 300 papers in the past 20 years built on these ﬁ ndings and helped to unveil the mechanisms of endophilin action in several types of endocytosis , including clathrin - mediated 8 , 10 – 12 , clathrin - independent 15 – 17 , 59 , and ultrafast endocytosis 18 . Our study shows that , in addition to its role in endocytosis , endophilin plays a key role in the priming and fusion of secretory vesicles . Endophilin is a peripheral protein with membrane - binding properties that appears to be present on some neurose - cretory vesicles , as observed by a signi ﬁ cant colocalization between the LDCV marker CgA and endophilin 1 , or endophilin 2 , respectively . Endophilin ’ s role in exocytosis is mediated through its SH3 - domain , and , speci ﬁ cally , through its SH3 - domain interactor intersectin - 1 , a partially membrane - associated protein that coordinates exocytosis and endocytosis and , like endophilin , translocates to the plasma membrane upon stimulation and reg - ulates exocytosis 26 , 27 . Endophilin ’ s role in exocytosis is direct and endocytosis - independent . We show that endophilin has a direct role in the vesicle exocytosis process itself : the expression of either endo - philin 1 or endophilin 2 alone was suf ﬁ cient to rescue all exocytic defects seen in neurosecretory cells without endophilin . Thus , the two endophilins have redundant roles in exocytosis . In addition , the expression of endophilin 1 or endophilin 2 - BAR domain was not suf ﬁ cient to produce a rescue of exocytosis in endophilin TKO cells . Next , endophilin that cannot bind intersectin - 1 ( E329K + S336K ) 23 was not able to rescue intersectin ’ s cellular distribution and exocytosis . None of the main exocytic proteins tested was found to be changed in the cells without endophilin , suggesting that the exocytic defect is not a result of altered protein sorting , or availability of exocytic machinery for secretion . The role of endophilin in exocytosis appears to be independent of its well - established functions in endocytosis since the recycling / uptake of proteins ( tested by transferrin and cholera toxin subunit - B uptake ) and membrane ( mCLING - Atto 647 ) were not majorly altered . We observed a mild decrease in the transferrin uptake ef ﬁ ciency between endophilin TKO and endophilin KOWTKO cells , yet no difference was detected between endophilin TKO and WT . This is an atypical ﬁ nding since it suggests that endophilin KOWTKO cells were more ef ﬁ cient in the transferrin uptake than WT cells . Although we did not observe any signi ﬁ cant changes in the total number of internalized vesicles with mCLING probe over the assayed time point in endophilin TKO cells , it is possible that the kinetics of the internalization , speci ﬁ cally in the ﬁ rst minutes , are altered — this could possibly affect the release site - clearance . However , a delay in release site - clearance cannot fully explain the observed phenotype , since chromaf ﬁ n cells in culture do not have specialized fusion sites , and the RRP release is affected in endophilin absence . In addition , given that the LDCV generation / maturation steps take tens of minutes to hours , this short initial endocytic delay is likely not relevant for the protein recycling and generation of new LDCVs . In addition , we did not observe any overall differences in the levels and distributions of several additional vesicular proteins ( e . g . , VAMP2 / synaptobrevin - 2 , synaptotagmin - 1 , synaptotagmin - 7 , etc . ) . The magnitude of exocytic defects in endophilin TKO cells is not as striking as the loss of the main SNAREs , Munc13 and Munc18 ( the key components of the exocytic machinery ) , or the simultaneous loss of both major calcium - sensors synaptotagmin - 1 and − 7 44 , 45 , 47 , 50 , 60 . Rather , the effect is intermediate , pointing to a regulatory role of endophilin in exocytosis . Endophilin ’ s role in exocytosis is mediated via its SH3 - domain and intersectin interaction . We followed several leads that could explain endophilin ’ s role in exocytosis . The absence of endophi - lin ’ s SH3 - domain reduced exocytosis even further than seen in endophilin TKO chromaf ﬁ n cells , revealing a dominant - negative effect of the BAR domain alone , likely due to altered endophilin interactions and / or a competition with other peripheral vesicle proteins . Interestingly , out of all exocytic and endocytic ( except clathrin ) proteins inspected , only the distributions of intersectin - 1 and intersectin - 2 were altered . It was reported previously that the endophilin - 1 : intersectin - 1 interaction is mediated through the SH3 - domains of both proteins 23 . We now found that an endophilin - 1 mutant that cannot bind intersectin - 1 ( E329K + S336K ) was neither able to rescue the altered intersectin - 1 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14993 - 8 12 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 1266 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14993 - 8 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications distribution , nor the exocytic defect of endophilin TKO chro - maf ﬁ n cells . Consistently , in the complementary experiment with intersectin - 1 KO chromaf ﬁ n cells , the reduced exocytosis could not be rescued with an intersectin - 1 mutant that cannot bind endophilin - 1 ( W949E + Y965E ) . Both intersectin - 1 and intersectin - 2 were initially discovered as scaffold proteins involved in endocytosis 29 , 61 – 66 . Yet , further investigations showed that intersectin - 1 is also implicated in several other processes including exocytosis 26 , 28 – 30 , thereby suggesting a role for intersectin in the coupling of exocytosis and endocytosis 24 , 25 , 30 . Intersectin - 1 has an additional role in modulating actin dynamics in chromaf ﬁ n cells , which might control the access of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane 67 , although recent examination of the Munc18 - 1 - dependent regula - tion of the actin barrier shows that a strong actin barrier does not necessarily affect vesicle priming and fusion 67 .

The polymerization of the actin barrier seems primarily RhoA - dependent , while the de novo synthesis of actin is Cdc42 - dependent 26 , 28 , 69 , 70 . We observed that , in the absence of endophilins , the actin barrier looks depolymerized in the resting condition , while stimulation increased actin ’ s density ( Suppl . Fig . 8 ) Thus , lack of endophilins led to a modulation of the actin barrier and the de novo synthesis . Therefore , the endophilin : intersectin interaction could also be a mechanism to control the actin barrier in chromaf ﬁ n cells . Once the actin barrier is depolymerized at the speci ﬁ c sites , secretory vesicles can be recruited to their site of release at the plasma membrane , possibly through an interaction between intersectin - 1 and the SNARE - protein SNAP - 25 or SNAP - 23 24 . We found that , without endophilin , intersectin mislocalized to the plasma membrane , and exocytosis was diminished . Strikingly , chromaf ﬁ n cells without intersectin - 1 also showed reduced exocytosis 27 , which could be rescued by expression of full - length protein , but not an endophilin - binding mutant in our studies . In this context , endophilin may also be viewed as a regulator of intersectin in exocytosis and the direct interaction between endophilin and intersectin may coordinate the secretory vesicle priming and fusion . A putative model of endophilin ’ s role in the regulation of exocytosis . This study , along with our previous results on endophilins and intersectin - 1 12 , 23 and the reported interaction between intersectin - 1 and the SNARE proteins SNAP - 25 and SNAP - 23 24 , as well as with the numerous intersectin studies ( see above ) , support the model depicted in Suppl . Fig . 9 . Whereas previous studies showed that the exocytotic proteins Munc18 - 1 , synaptotagmin - 1 , SNAP - 25 and syntaxin - 1 are necessary for vesicle docking 60 , 71 , 72 , endophilin and intersectin act in tandem to stimulate the priming and fusion of docked vesicles , likely through intersectin ’ s interaction with SNARE proteins and / or a role in regulating the local actin network near the plasma membrane . Endophilin 1 and 2 as well as intersectin - 1 are present on the majority but not all neurosecretory vesicles , and the effects of their absence are intermediate ( when compared to SNAREs , Munc18 , synaptotagmin - 1 and - 7 ) , suggesting a regulatory role . Once recruited to ( the proximity of ) the plasma membrane , we propose that endophilin and intersectin do not dissociate from the plasma membrane but take part in the endocytic process that follows the fusion of secretory vesicles . In addition to a complete LDCV fusion , kiss - and - run fusion is not uncommon in chromaf ﬁ n cells 73 . Endophilin , as one of the main dynamin recruiters to the vesicle ﬁ ssion site , is therefore ideally positioned , together with intersectin , to act as a scaffold that couples vesicle fusion ( exocytosis ) and ﬁ ssion ( endocytosis ) events . This premise is supported by both endophilin ’ s and intersectin ’ s direct interactions with dynamin 4 , 24 , as well as two studies in invertebrates : Bai et al . 19 suggested that endophilin is delivered to endocytic zones by exocytosis in C . elegans , and Winther et al . 74 showed that D . melanogaster ’ s Dap160 / intersectin mutants lacking dynamin - binding do not properly accumulate dynamin in the periactive zone . Notably , we show that , without endophilin , intersectin is mislocalized ; since endophilin can regulate intersectin ’ s localization , this protein may be part of a check - point mechanism to ensure that intersectin acts only at the optimal time . Further studies are needed to understand whether this model , based on data from neuroendocrine cells , also can account for endophilin ( and intersectin ) ’ s roles in exocytosis at neuronal synapses . In conclusion , our study suggests that the exocytosis of neurosecretory vesicles is regulated by endophilin 1 and endophilin 2 , that were so far considered primarily as endocytic adaptors . This function of endophilin in exocytosis is dependent on intersectin : together they coordinate , at least in part , secretory vesicle priming and fusion . Methods Experimental models . All animal - related procedures were performed according to the European guidelines for animal welfare ( 2010 / 63 / EU ) , with the explicit per - missions from the Niedersächsisches Landesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit ( LAVES ) , registration 14 / 1701 , or the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate ( 2012 - 15 - 2935 - 00001 and 2018 - 15 - 0202 - 00157 ) . Ani - mals were housed and bred in the Zentrale Tierexperimentelle Einrichtung ( ZTE ) Göttingen , or at the AAALAC - accredited stable at the Department of Experimental Medicine , University of Copenhagen , with ad libitum access to water and food . Mice were kept in groups of 1 – 3 animals on a 12 h light / 12h dark cycle in indi - vidually ventilated cages . Endophilin mutant mice were originally generated and described in Milosevic et al . 12 , and are accessible from the Jackson Laboratory ( strain 021573 — B6 ; 129 - Sh3gl2 tm1Pdc / J ; strain 021574 — B6 ; 129 - Sh3gl1 tm1Pdc / J ; 021575 — B6 ; 129 - Sh3gl3 tm1 . 1Itl / J ) . ITSN - 1 knock - out mice were originally described in Yu et al . 27 . Both male and female P0 pups were used to prepare cultures of adrenal chromaf ﬁ n cells as follows : adrenal glands were isolated from P0 mice and placed in Locke ’ s solution ( 154mM NaCl , 5 . 6mM KCl , 0 . 85 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 2 . 15 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 10 mM glucose , pH 7 . 2 ) , and connective tissue was cleaned away . The glands were digested in 200µl enzyme solution ( 22 . 5 units / ml papain in Dulbecco ' s modi ﬁ ed Eagle medium ( DMEM ) medium with high glucose ( Gibco ) supplemented with 25mg L - cysteine , 125 µl 1 M CaCl 2 , 1 . 25 ml 50mM EDTA pH 7 . 4 ) at 37 °C for 35 min . The papain was inactivated by adding 200 μ L inactivating solution ( 312 . 5 mg albumin fraction - V , 312 . 5 mg trypsin inhibitor , 112 . 5 ml DMEM medium with high glucose supplemented with 12 . 5ml heat - inactivated fetal calf serum ( Life Technologies ) ) for 5 min at 37 °C . This solution was replaced by 180 μ L enriched DMEM medium ( 6 . 7 g DMEM powder with high glucose ( Gibco ) was dissolved in 496 . 5 ml double - distilled water supplemented with 0 . 55 g NaHCO 3 , 1ml penicillin / streptomycin ( Life Technologies ) and 2 . 5ml insulin - transferrin - selenium - X ( Thermo Fischer Scienti ﬁ c ) ) and the glands were triturated ( 5 – 6 times ) using a 200 μ L pipette . The cells were plated on cleaned and sterilized glass coverslips and allowed to settle for 30 – 45min before adding 1ml enriched DMEM medium . The cells were maintained at 37°C and 8 % CO 2 , and used within 3 – 4 days for the experiments . Cloning and virus production . For the rescue experiments , full - length endophilin 1 , and endophilin 2 , were cloned into the lentivirus ( LV ) expression vector FUGW ( a gift of Oliver Schlüter , European Neuroscience Institute Göttingen , Germany ) containing an IRES followed by an enhanced green ﬂ uorescent protein ( EGFP ) to allow simultaneous yet independent expression of both proteins . Endophilin 1 and endophilin 2 were ﬁ rst ampli ﬁ ed by a PCR reaction ( original plasmids were described in ref . 12 ) and then inserted into the FUGW vector using XbaI and BamHI restriction enzymes . Similarly , endophilin 1 - BAR and endophilin 2 - BAR constructs ( BAR domain and the linker sequence ) were cloned by amplifying and inserting the endophilin 1 - BAR and 2 - BAR sequences into FUGW vector using XbaI and BamHI restriction enzymes . Endophilin 1 Δ ITSN ( endophilin 1 E329K + S336K — mutant that cannot bind intersectin - 1 23 ) was ﬁ rst generated by Quik - Change II Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent ) and subsequently inserted into the FUGW vector using XbaI and BamHI restriction enzymes . Intersectin - 1 together with GFP was ﬁ rst extracted using NheI and SalI restriction enzyme ( source plasmid Addgene # 47395 ) and then inserted into the lentiviral vector ( p156rrl - Syt1 - SEP ) using XbaI and SalI restriction enzymes . Intersectin - 1 Δ endo ( mutant intersectin - 1 W949E + Y965E that cannot bind endophilin 23 ) was gen - erated by QuikChange II Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent ) from the above described intersectin - 1 in viral expression vector . All constructs were veri ﬁ ed by sequencing and control restriction digestion . Constructs encoding the human intersectin - 1 - SH3B ( aa 914 - 970 ) cloned in pET28a and recombinant rat endophilin A1 FL cloned into pGEX4T - 1 ( Amersham Biosciences ) were published in Pech - stein et al . 23 . Lentiviral particles were generated as follows : 1× 10 7 HEK293FT cells were plated per Ø10cm dish . The cells were transfected with lentivirus transfer plasmid as detailed above ( third generation lentivirus system ) along with envelop and packaging plasmids using Lipofectamine - 2000 and following the manufacturer ’ s protocol ( Invitrogen ) . The cells were maintained in the S2 bio - safety laboratory henceforth , and the medium was exchanged 14 h post - transfection . The medium containing lentivirus suspension was collected , centrifuged at 3000 RPM for 15min at 4°C to remove cell debris . Further , virus was concentrated using Amicon ( 100K , UFC910096 ) at 4000 RPM for 20 min at 4 °C . The concentrated particles were diluted in Tris - buffer saline ( TBS ; pH 7 . 4 ) ; aliquots were frozen in cryo - tubes in liquid nitrogen and stored in − 80 °C until being used . The ef ﬁ ciency of the lentivirus was tested by western blot and by imaging the intensity of the ﬂ uorescent reporter . The virus particles were added 6 – 8 h after chromaf ﬁ n cell plating , and the cells were used 60 – 72h post infection . Lentiviral expression systems were veri ﬁ ed in HEK - 293 cells by western blotting and / or in chromaf ﬁ n cells by measuring the ﬂ uorescence intensities of EGFP ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14993 - 8 14 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 1266 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14993 - 8 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications expressed through bicistronic system . In either case , three independent experiments were performed , and each time new set of HEK - 293 cells were transfected as indicated , collected , then proteins were extracted , quanti ﬁ ed and inspected by western blot , as detailed below . Protein expression , puri ﬁ cation , and pull - down . Recombinant human intersectin - 1 SH3B ( aa 914 - 970 ) and recombinant rat endophilin A1 FL were expressed by E . coli in 2xYT medium ( Sigma - Aldrich ) overnight at 18°C ( induction at OD 600 0 . 5 - 0 . 7 with 1 mM isopropylthio - β - galactoside , IPTG ) . Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation ( 6000 x g , 4 °C , 10 min ) , lysed and supernatant was collected after the second centrifugation ( 15 , 000x g , 4°C , 20min ) . The GST and His - fusion proteins were then puri ﬁ ed by af ﬁ nity chromatography using com - mercial GST - Bind resin ( Novagen ) and His - Select Nickel Af ﬁ nity Gel ( Sigma ) following the manufacturer ’ s protocols , and subsequently subjected to gel ﬁ ltration on a Superdex 75 16 / 60 column ( GE Healthcare ) buffered in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , pH 7 . 4 . The af ﬁ nity tags were removed by incubation with thrombin ( 1U / mg of protein , 1h , 37°C ) before gel ﬁ ltration . The puri ﬁ ed proteins were used for the pull - down experiments . In short , 50 or 100 μ g GST - fusion proteins were coupled to GST - Bind resin ( Novagen ) and incubated with 10 μ g His 6 - tagged recombinant proteins , respectively , in a total volume of 1ml for 1h at 4°C on a rotating wheel . Following extensive washes , samples were eluted and analyzed by direct Coomassie staining and / or sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and immunoblotting . Western blotting . Standard SDS - PAGE blot was used to analyze total protein levels . An electrophoresis system ( BIO - RAD ) was used to perform the separation using custom - prepared gels ( 10 % or 12 % , pH 8 . 8 ) , depending on the size of a protein to be analyzed by immunoblotting . Protein samples were prepared from intact adrenal glands ( note that glands from 3 – 4 animals of the same genotype were pooled together , and referred to as one biological sample ) in RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % SDS and 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , SDS , with fresh 1x protease / phosphatase inhibitor supplement , Roche ) , mixed with 6x Laemmli buffer ( 4 . 16 M SDS , 47 ml glycerol , 0 . 9 mM bro - mophenol blue , 12ml 0 . 5 M Tris pH 6 . 8 , 5µl β - mercaptoethanol in 100ml dH 2 O ) and denatured for 5 min at 95 °C . Forty micrograms of sample / well was loaded . After electrophoresis , the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using the transfer system ( BIO - RAD ) . The membranes were further blocked in 5 % milk prepared in 1x Tris - Buffered Saline ( TBS ) and 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ( blocking buffer ) at room temperature for 1h , and subsequently incubated with primary and secondary antibodies ( diluted in the blocking buffer ) . The proteins were detected using the Odyssey infrared imaging system ( Li - COR ) and analyzed using Image Studio Lite ( a software package from LI - COR Biosciences ) and / or ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / index . html ) . Both software were used to compare the density ( i . e . , intensity ) of bands on a digital image of the western blot after sub - tracting the background signal from the adjacent area . original western blot data are shown in Suppl . Fig . 10 . Electrophysiological measurements . The mouse chromaf ﬁ n cells were main - tained in extracellular solution ( 145mM NaCl , 2 . 8 mM KCl , 2mM CaCl 2 , 1mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES , and 2mg / ml D - glucose , pH 7 . 2 , 305 mOsM / kg ) during the electrophysiological recordings , which were performed at room temperature ( 22 – 24°C ) . Capacitance and amperometric measurements were performed in parallel on a Zeiss Axiovert 10 equipped with Polychrome V monochromator ( Till Photonics ) , an EPC - 9 ampli ﬁ er ( HEKA Elektronik ) for patch - clamp capacitance measurements and an EPC - 7 ( HEKA Elektronik ) for amperometry . Catecholamine release was triggered by ultraviolet - ﬂ ash photolysis ( using a JML - C2 , Rapp Optoelektronik ) of a caged calcium compound , nitrophenyl - EGTA , which was transferred into the cell through a patch pipette . The setup calibration was done by infusion of eight solutions of known calcium concentrations into chromaf ﬁ n cells , by ratiometric measurement of two calcium dyes with different calcium binding af ﬁ nity , Fura4F and Furaptra ( ThermoFischer Scienti ﬁ c ) and this allowed intra - cellular calcium monitoring . The excitation light ( Polychrome V ) was alternated between 350 and 380 nm to perform the ratiometric measurements of [ Ca 2 + ] i . The emitted ﬂ uorescence was detected with a photodiode and sampled using Pulse software ( HEKA ) . The same software was used to control the voltage in the pipette and perform capacitance measurements . The intracellular solution contained ( in mM ) : 100 Cs - glutamate , 8 NaCl , 4 CaCl 2 , 32 Cs - HEPES , 2 Mg - ATP , 0 . 3 GTP , 5 NPE , 0 . 4 Fura4F , and 0 . 4 Furaptra ( L - ascorbic acid was added to prevent ﬂ ash - induced damage to Fura dyes ) , pH 7 . 2 ( osmolarity adjusted to ∼ 295mOsm / kg ) . Amperometric recordings were done using Ø5 μ m carbon ﬁ bers ( Thornel P - 650 / 42 , Cytec ) insulated by the polyethylene method 75 and EPC - 7 ( HEKA Elektronik ) . Cells were perfused with intracellular solution for single amperometry spikes , consisting of 70 mM Cs - glutamate , 8 mM NaCl , 4mM CaCl 2 , 22 . 5mM Cs - HEPES , 2 mM Mg - ATP , 0 . 3mM Na - GTP , 37mM Ca 2 + DPTA , 0 . 32 mM Fura - 4F and 0 . 48mM Furaptra pH 7 . 2 ( osmolarity adjusted to ∼ 300mOsm / kg ) . Fibers were clamped to 700 mV . Currents were acquired at 25 kHz and ﬁ ltered off - line using a Gaussian ﬁ lter with a cutoff set at 1kHz . Electrophysiological and amperometry experiments were performed in such way that conditions could be compared side - by - side : e . g . , the WT and mutant constructs are expressed in chromaf ﬁ n cells from the same animal ( e . g . , TKO cells ) , and the same number of cells for each condition is recorded on each experimental day . If comparing various genotypes ( e . g . , KOWTKO and TKO ) , this is done exclusively in littermates , prepared in parallel and recorded on the same day . Number of cells indicated in Figure legends represent biological replicates ; cells are isolated from several animals ( as indicated ) , and at least three sets of recordings from independent cell preparations from 1 or 2 litters ( if two litters are born on the same day ) were done for each dataset , often more ( as indicated ) . Plasma membrane sheet assay . Plasma membrane sheets were generated from cultured mouse chromaf ﬁ n cells by adapting a protocol originally described in Milosevic et al . 39 for ( large ) bovine chromaf ﬁ n cells . Brie ﬂ y , the cells were subjected to a brief ultrasonic pulse in the sonication buffer ( 120mM potassium glutamate , 20 mM potassium acetate , 20 mM HEPES , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM EGTA , 6mM Ca 2 + - EGTA , pH 7 . 3 , 300 mOsm / kg ) in order to generate thin , ﬂ at inside - out plasma membrane sheets . Detailed protocol for mouse chromaf ﬁ n plasma mem - brane sheets generation is described elsewhere 40 . The plasma membrane sheets were immediately ﬁ xed with 4 % freshly prepared paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS ( Sigma ) for 1h before proceeding with the immunostaining procedure as detailed below . Immunocytochemistry . Chromaf ﬁ n cells were cultured for up to 72 h on poly - L - lysine coated coverslips in a 12 - well plate ( Sarstedt ) for immunocytochemistry experiments . The cells were ﬁ xed in freshly prepared 4 % PFA in PBS and neu - tralized afterwards for 20 min with 50mM NH 4 Cl in PBS . Blocking was performed with a blocking buffer containing 3 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ; Sigma ) , 0 . 2 % cold - ﬁ sh gelatine ( Sigma ) and 1 % goat serum ( Gibco ) for 1h , and cells were permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma ) in the blocking buffer for 10 min . After a brief washing step , the cells were stained with primary antibody overnight at 4°C followed by washing and secondary antibody staining in the dark at room temperature for 1h ( the antibodies are listed in Key Resources Table ; the endo - philin antibodies were characterized as speci ﬁ c , since little to no signal was detected in TKO cells ) . The washing procedure was repeated following 2 min incubation with 4 ’ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI 1 : 5000 in PBS ; Sigma ) to stain the nucleus of the chromaf ﬁ n cells . Finally , the coverslips were mounted in Mowiol 4 - 88 ® mounting medium ( Sigma ) . Images were acquired using Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning confocal microscope or Zeiss LSM 800 Airyscan confocal microscope ( 63x objective , numerical aperture 1 . 4 ) . For chromaf ﬁ n cell stimulation , the cells were washed carefully in pre - warmed Locke ’ s solution before incubation in extracellular ( control condition ) or high K + solution ( 88 mM NaCl , 59 mM KCl , 2mM CaCl 2 , 1mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES , and 2 mg / ml D - glucose , pH 7 . 20 , 300 mOsM / kg ) for 3min at room temperature ( RT ) . The cells were placed on ice immediately , ﬁ xed in 4 % PFA ( freshly prepared in PBS ) for 10min on ice followed by 20min at RT . Electron microscopy on adrenal mouse chromaf ﬁ n cells . Adrenal glands from endophilin TKO , endophilin KOWTKO and WT P0 mice were isolated and subsequently ﬁ xed in 4 % PFA + 0 , 5 % glutaraldehyde ( GA ; Sigma ) in 0 . 1 M PBS , pH 7 . 2 for 1h on ice , and afterwards in 2 % GA in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ; Sigma ) overnight at 4°C . The next day , the adrenal glands were washed three times for 10 min in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer . Post - ﬁ xation was done on ice for 1h in 1 % ( v / v ) OsO 4 in cacodylate buffer , followed by further washing steps ( 2 ×10 min cacodylate buffer , 3× 5min water ) . En - bloc staining of adrenal glands was performed using 1 % ( v / v ) uranyl acetate ( Sigma ) in water for 1h on ice . Subsequent to three brief washing steps in water , adrenal glands were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series ( 5 min 30 % , 5min 50 % , 10 min 70 % , 2× 10min 95 % , 3 ×12 min 99 . 9 % ethanol ) and in ﬁ ltrated in Epon resin ( 50 % ethanol + 50 % epon for 30min and for 90min , 100 % epon for ~ 20h ) at room temperature . The samples were placed in the embedding molds and polymerized for 48 h at 70 °C . Ultrathin sections ( 65 nm ) were cut using a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome , placed on formvar - coated copper grids , and stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate ( using the Reynold ’ s method ) . Images were acquired as detailed in Kroll et al . 76 by a JEOL JEM - 1011 transmission electron microscope ( on average 5 images / cell were acquired ) . Dissociated chromaf ﬁ n cell cultures were prepared for ultrastructural analysis as in 49 . Brie ﬂ y , the cells were ﬁ xed with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1M cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 1 h at RT , followed by overnight at 4°C . Cells were washed after ﬁ xation and post - ﬁ xed for 1h at RT with 1 % OsO 4 / 1 % KRu ( CN ) 6 . After dehydration through a series of increasing ethanol concentrations , cells were in ﬁ ltrated with Epon resin that was polymerized at 65 °C and the coverslip was removed by alternatively dipping it in hot water and liquid nitrogen . Regions with high density of chromaf ﬁ n cells were selected by observing ﬂ at Epon - embedded cell monolayer under the light microscope and mounted on Epon blocks for thin sectioning . Ultrathin sections ( 80 nm ) were cut parallel to the cell monolayer on an Ultracut ultramicrotome ( Leica ) , collected on single - slot , Formvar - coated copper grids and contrasted by 0 . 5 % uranyl acetate and Reynold ’ s lead citrate in an AC20 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14993 - 8 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 1266 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 14993 - 8 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 15 ultrastainer ( Leica ) . Images of chromaf ﬁ n cell cross sections were taken on a JEOL1010 TEM with a Modera side - mounted CCD camera ( EMSIS ) at 60kV at 10k ( overview ) and 30k ( membrane area ) fold magni ﬁ cation . Endocytosis assays on chromaf ﬁ n cells . Transferrin ( Tf ) was conjugated to Alexa Fluor TM 546 ( 5µg / ml ; Invitrogen , Cat # T23364 ) , and the uptake assay in adrenal chromaf ﬁ n cells was performed as in Chen et al . 77 . All images were cap - tured under the same acquisition settings using a Zeiss 800 Airyscan confocal microscope . Analysis of Tf - A546 data ( z - stack of whole cells ) was performed by Imaris ( Bitplane ) using the Spot module . Non - toxic recombinant cholera toxin subunit - B ( CT - B ) was conjugated to Alexa Fluor TM 594 ( Thermo Fischer , Cat # C22842 ) , and the uptake assay was adapted to adrenal chromaf ﬁ n cells using the protocol from Kirkham et al . 78 In short , uptake of 2 µg / ml CT - B - A594 was carried out at 37°C in serum - free medium ( Gibco ) for 8min ( note that CT - B - A594 attaches to cells by binding to ganglioside GM 1 ) , Cells were washed 4 ×30 s with the extracellular buffer to remove CT - B - A594 cell surface labeling , ﬁ xed in 4 % PFA for 20 min , and imaged with a Zeiss 800 confocal microscope . Images were cap - tured through the equatorial plane of each cell ( one plane only ) using the same acquisition settings and were analyzed in ImageJ ( a background - threshold was applied and every ﬂ uorescent cluster greater than six pixels was counted ) . Live imaging of chromaf ﬁ n cells labeled with mCLING - Atto647 ( Synaptic Systems ) was done using the spinning disk confocal microscope ( Perkin Elmer / Nikon / Volocity ) with temperature control unit ( kept at 37 °C ) and custom - built imaging chamber . Cells were maintained in extracellular solution in imaging chamber and stained with 0 . 5 nmol / ml mCLING - Atto647 for 1 min . The solution was exchanged and cells were washed rapidly ( few seconds ) before image acquisition . Images were captured up to 8 min after addition of mCLING - Atto647 through the middle of each cell ( using the same acquisition settings ) and quanti ﬁ ed using ImageJ as detailed above for CT - B - A594 . Quanti ﬁ cation and statistical analysis . Unless otherwise stated , in the ﬁ gure legends , N represents number of independent experiments , and n denotes indivi - dual cells / biological samples obtained from N ( or more ) animals . Colocalization analysis in mouse chromaf ﬁ n cells was performed as follows : colocalization was evaluated using object - based overlap and JACoP plugin in ImageJ since endophilin signals had a cytosolic component . Speci ﬁ cally , a region - of - interest ( ROI ) was chosen so it did not contain nucleus , and the images were segmented into objects and background ( bright ﬂ uorescent objects were segmented from the image ) before Pearson ’ s correlation coef ﬁ cient was calculated . The same analysis was performed with the 90° rotated image , and this random value was subtracted for each cell . In addition , a complementary manual colocalization analysis was performed : here , circles were superimposed on bright ﬂ uorescent spots ( e . g . , in the CgA channel ) and transferred to identical image locations in the endophilin channel . If the ﬂ uorescence intensity maximum in the endophilin channel was located in the same circle and the morphology of the signal resembled that of the CgA signal , the circle was rated as positive ( colocalized ) . If this was not the case , it was rated as negative ( not colocalized ) . To correct for random colocalization of two abundant signals , circles were also transferred to a 90° rotated image of the endophilin channel . At least 9 images / experiment from 3 to 5 experiments were analyzed for each geno - type / condition . The two approaches ( semi - automatic ImageJ - based and manual ) gave similar result . Colocalization analysis on the plasma membrane sheets was performed as follows : a ROI was chosen on the plasma membrane in the blue channel ( TMA - DPH staining ) and transferred to the green ( endophilins ) and red ( CgA or ITSN1 ) channels , and the mean cross - correlation coef ﬁ cient was calculated between green and red signals using Igor Pro ( Wave Metrics ) . The same analysis was performed with the 90° rotated image , and this random value was subtracted for each respective measurement . In addition , a complementary manual colocalization analysis was performed as detailed above ; the two approaches gave similar result . The kinetic analysis of the capacitance measurements was performed by ﬁ tting individual capacitance traces with a triple - exponential function using IGOR Pro software , as in Milosevic et al . 39 . The amplitudes and time constants of the two faster exponentials de ﬁ ne the size and release kinetics of the slowly releasable pool ( SRP ) and the readily releasable pool ( RRP ) , respectively . Filtering , spike detection and analysis of amperometric spikes were performed by a in IGOR Pro ( Wave Metrics ) as in ref . 79 . Data are represented as mean± SEM , and unpaired two - sided t - test ( for two datasets ) , and nonparametric Kruskal – Wallis test with Dunn ’ s multiple comparison test or one - way ANOVA after Tukey ’ s post - hoc test ( for three datasets ) were used to test statistical difference , which is indicated by * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , and * * * p < 0 . 001 . For the ultrastructural analysis by EM , independent embeddings per group were analyzed using IMOD ( bio3d . colorado . edu / imod ) and ImageJ software ( analysis was blind to experimental conditions ) . The area of chromaf ﬁ n cells was de ﬁ ned as area within the plasma membrane , thereby excluding the nucleus area . The area of LDCVs was directly measured using the area selection tool in ImageJ . The statistics is done by one - way ANOVA after Tukey ’ s post - hoc test ( Suppl . Fig . 3b – e ) and Kolmogorov – Smirnov test ( Suppl . Fig . 3f , g ; to ensure that the detected differences were not artefacts created by multiple comparisons , we applied Bonferroni - correction ) . For the cultured cells analysis , quantitative morphometric analysis was performed in iTEM software ( EMSIS ) blinded for experimental conditions . The data obtained from individual cells was nested within individual animal ( more than one observation drawn from one independent sample , an animal ) . To accommodate potential dependency , we tested the effects by multilevel analysis using SPSS ( IBM ) software 80 . For quanti ﬁ cation of CgA - positive vesicles ( Fig . 4a , b ) and Syt - 1 intensity on CgA - positive vesicles ( Fig . 4c , e ) , three - dimensional surface reconstruction and immuno ﬂ uorescence signal analysis was carried out with the “ Cell with organelles ” module of Imaris software , version 8 . 0 . 2 ( Bitplane ) . For quanti ﬁ cation of intensity of proteins detected by immuno ﬂ uorescence ( Fig . 4d , g and Fig . 5a ) , the mean ﬂ uorescence intensity was measured in the cell cytoplasm , excluding the nucleus , using ImageJ and normalized to the measured area . The data are represented as mean± SEM and statistics was performed by unpaired t - test . To characterize the redistribution of endophilins and intersectins ( Figs . 1e – h and 7a – f ; Suppl . Fig . 7c – f ) , we capitalized on the round - shape of adrenal chromaf ﬁ n cells and de ﬁ ned a ROI - based analysis approach in ImageJ software . Two concentric ROIs were de ﬁ ned : the outer circular ROI around the whole cell and the inner circular ROI ( to measure the intensity of the cytosol ) . The inner circular ROI was de ﬁ ned to be 40 pixels less than the radius of the outer ROI . The intensities of two ROIs were then measured , and the inner circular ROI was subtracted from the outer circular ROI to calculate the near - membrane intensity . The ratio of intensities between membrane and cytosol was plotted . The data are represented as mean± SEM . Reporting summary .
