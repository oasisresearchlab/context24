Here we performed a microRNA microarray to identify the molecular causes of this cardiac phenotype that revealed the dysregulation of several micro - RNAs including miR - 301a , which was highly downregulated in Cs1 - ko mice compared to the wild - type littermates . Cofilin - 2 ( Cfl2 ) was identified as one of the potential targets of miR - 301a using prediction databases , which we validated by luciferase assay and mutation of predicted binding sites . Furthermore , expression of miR - 301a contrastingly regulated Cfl2 expression levels in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes ( NRVCM ) . Along these lines , Cfl2 was significantly upregulated in Cs1 - ko mice , indicating the physiological association between miR - 301a and Cfl2 in vivo . Mechanistically , we found that Cfl2 activated serum response factor response element ( SRF - RE ) driven luciferase activity in neonatal rat cardio - myocytes and in C2C12 cells . Similarly , knockdown of miR301a activated , whereas , its overexpression inhibited the SRF - RE driven luciferase activity , further strengthening physio - logical interaction between miR - 301a and Cfl2 . Interestingly , the expression of SRF and its target genes was strikingly increased in Cs1 - ko suggesting a possible in vivo correlation between expression levels of Cfl2 / miR - 301a and SRF activation , which needs to be inde - pendently validated . In summary , our data demonstrates that miR - 301a regulates Cofilin - 2 in vitro in NRVCM , and in vivo in Cs1 - ko mice . Our findings provide an additional and impor - tant layer of Cfl2 regulation , which we believe has an extended role in cardiac signal trans - duction and dilated cardiomyopathy presumably due to the reported involvement of Cfl2 in these mechanisms . Introduction Several forms of cardiomyopathies including dilated ( DCM ) , hypertrophic ( HCM ) , and ische - mic cardiomyopathy ( ICM ) , can lead to heart failure which is linked to poor prognosis [ 1 , 2 ] .

The fundershad DCM patients suffer from dilatation of the left ventricle , hypertrophy of the cardiomyocytes with increased heart weight and myocardial fibrosis , arrhythmias , heart failure and a high risk for sudden cardiac death ; however , the etiology of the DCM is not sufficiently understood [ 3 , 4 ] . Possible causes though incorporate genetic and non - genetic variables whereby the genetic background is suspected to be responsible for up to 50 % of all DCM cases . For better under - standing of the pathophysiology of cardiomyopathy , it is crucial to identify and characterize the biomolecules and molecular pathways that are involved in the pathogenesis [ 2 , 5 , 6 ] . One of the well characterized pathways is Calcineurin signaling which has been shown to be involved in the development of pathological HCM and DCM [ 7 – 9 ] . Previously , the Calsarcin protein family has been described as Calcineurin - interacting proteins at the Z - disk in muscle cells [ 10 – 12 ] . Calsarcin - 1 is the only isoform present in the adult heart [ 12 ] , which tethers Cal - cineurin to α - actinin at the Z - disc and inhibits pathological hypertrophic response due to Cal - cineurin [ 13 ] . Calsarcin - 1 also prevents angiotensin - II induced cardiac hypertrophy in a cardiac - specific transgenic mouse model , which underlines its role as an inhibitor of patholog - ical hypertrophy [ 14 ] . In contrast , Calsarcin - 1 deficient mice are sensitized to Calcineurin sig - naling and show a massive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy when stressed biomechanically in a mixed genetic background without displaying a baseline hypertrophy phenotype [ 13 ] . In pres - ent study , after more than 10 back - crosses to obtain Calsarcin - 1 null mouse in pure C57BL / 6 background in order to study the effect of genetic background , if any , mice displayed dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype with contractile dysfunction and increased expression of fetal genes nppa , and nppb in addition to upregulated rcan1 - 4 without any signs of hypertrophy . The tread - milling of actin and its regulation via RhoA , a small family GTPase , and tran - scription factor serum response factor ( SRF ) , when dysfunctional , highly suggestive of DCM [ 15 – 18 ] . The treadmilling and actin dynamic is also regulated by the Actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin family proteins . This protein family consists of three members in mam - mals , Cofilin - 1 which is expressed in all cell types , ADF is expressed only in epithelial / endothe - lial cells , and Cofilin - 2 ( Cfl2 ) , which is predominantly expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle [ 19 – 23 ] . The structure of ADF / cofilin family protein is evolutionarily highly conserved suggesting an essential structural and functional role for these proteins [ 24 ] . One of its main functions is the regulation of actin dynamics by binding and severing filamentous actin at the pointed end ( - ) [ 25 ] . Especially , Cfl2 , the muscle isoform , reportedly control precise length of the sarcomeres in cardiomyocytes [ 26 ] . Lack of Cfl2 in mice is not embryonically lethal indi - cating no significant developmental role , however , Cfl2 deficient mice die around 8 days after birth due to severe muscle defects [ 27 ] . Interestingly , Cfl2 has recently been linked to the path - ogenesis of DCM where Cfl2 was found to be hyper - phosphorylated and present in aggregates in cardiomyocytes of human idiopathic DCM samples [ 28 ] . Furthermore , the heterogenic knockout of Cfl2 in the murine heart leads to a DCM - like phenotype [ 28 ] . Nevertheless , Cfl2 function and its regulation are complex [ 21 ] and its precise role in the development of DCM is not satisfactorily understood . Here , we performed a microRNA microarray on cardiac RNA extracted from Calsarcin - 1 deficient mice in a pure C57BL / 6 background , which display a strict DCM phenotype . Through this screen , we identified miR - 301a as the most downregulated microRNA that we found targets Cfl2 , a major regulator of actin dynamics , in vitro and in vivo . Moreover , our in vitro data indicated that miR - 301a attenuates RhoA - mediated activation of SRF signaling via targeting Cfl2 without affecting cellular hypertrophy . Therefore , we believe that our findings provide an important layer in Cfl2 regulation , which needs further in vivo validations for exploiting the therapeutic potential of miR - 301 / Cfl2 interactions in cardiac signal transduction and DCM . miR - 301aregulatesCofilin - 2in the heart PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0183901 September 8 , 2017 2 / 21 no role in studydesign , datacollection and analysis , decision to publish , or preparation of the manuscript .

Total RNA from Cs1 - ko and wild - type mice was isolated using QIAzol lysis reagent according to the manufacture’s instruction ( Qiagen ) . The quality of total RNA was checked by gel analysis using the total RNA Nano chip assay on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies ) . Only samples with RNA index values > 8 . 5 were selected for expression profiling . RNA concentrations were determined using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer ( NanoDrop Technologies ) . Biotin - labeled cRNA samples for hybridization on Illumina Mouse Sentrix - 6 BeadChip arrays ( Illumina , Inc . ) were prepared according to Illumina’s recommended sample labeling procedure based on the modified Eber - wine protocol [ 30 ] . In brief , 250 ng total RNA was used for complementary DNA ( cDNA ) syn - thesis , followed by an amplification / labeling step ( in vitro transcription ) to synthesize biotin - labeled cRNA according to the MessageAmp II RNA Amplification kit ( Ambion , Inc . ) . The cRNA was column purified according to TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit , and eluted in 60 μl of water . Quality of cRNA was controlled using the RNA Nano Chip Assay on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and spectrophotometrically quantified ( NanoDrop ) . Hybridization was per - formed at 58˚C , in GEX - HCB buffer ( Illumina Inc . ) at a concentration of 100 ng cRNA / μ l , unsealed in a wet chamber for 20h . Spike - in controls for low , medium and highly abundant RNAs were added , as well as mismatch control and biotinylation control oligonucleotides . Microarrays were washed twice in E1BC buffer ( Illumina Inc . ) at room temperature for 5 min - utes . After blocking for 5 min in 4 ml of 1 % ( wt / vol ) Blocker Casein in phosphate buffered saline Hammarsten grade ( Pierce Biotechnology ) , array signals were developed by a 10 - min incubation in 2 ml of 1 μg / ml Cy3 - streptavidin ( Amersham Biosciences ) solution and 1 % blocking solution . After a final wash in E1BC , the arrays were dried and scanned . Scanning and data analysis . Microarray scanning was carried out using a Beadstation array scanner , with settings adjusted to a scaling factor of 1 and PMT settings at 430 . Data extraction was done for all beads individually , and outliers were removed when > 2 . 5 MAD ( median absolute deviation ) . All remaining data points were used for the calculation of the mean average signal for a given probe , and standard deviation for each probe was calculated . Scanning data was analyzed by normalization of signals using the quantile normalization algorithm without background subtraction , and differentially regulated genes were defined by calculating the standard deviation differences of a given probe in Cs1 - ko vs WT mice compari - son . Microarray data is deposited to GEO databank under the accession number GSE100851 . Protein isolation and immunoblotting Heart tissue samples were shredded using the tissue separator ( IKA Ultra - Turrax ; Sigma - Aldrich ) in 1ml lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris , 10 mM DTT , 500mM Sodium chloride , 1 % NP40 , 12 , 5 % Glycerol . The protease inhibitor cocktail tablets ( Roche ) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 2 and 3 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) were added just before usage . NRVCM were lysed and scratched off the 6 - well plate in 180μl lysis buffer . After 3 cycles of freeze - thaw , lysate was centrifuged at 10000xg to remove the cell debris . Protein concentration was measured by pho - tometry using Bradford Protein Assay Kit ( Bio - Rad ) . For immunoblotting protein samples were resolved by 10 % SDS - PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane ( GE Healthcare ) . Membranes were blocked with 5 % dry - milk in TBS - T for 2h and incubated with respective primary antibodies at 4˚C overnight . After thorough washes with TBS - T buffer , sec - ondary antibody containing horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) for chemiluminescence or AF546 fluorophore for fluorescence was applied at room temperature for 2h .

Histology Mouse hearts were molded into Tissue - Tek Cryomolder ( Sakura Finetek ) , and frozen on dry ice . Cryosections of 7 μm thickness were used for the histology . Lectin staining was carried out using FITC conjugated lectin from Triticum vulgaris ( wheat ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Images were captured on BZ - 9000 immunofluorescence microscope ( Keyence ) and cross - sectional area of the cardiomyocytes was analyzed with ImageJ software ( version 1 . 46 ) . The extent of fibrosis was measured by Sirius - red / fast green staining as described earlier [ 31 , 32 ] . Images captured on BZ - 9000 Keyence microscope were analyzed by BZ - II Analyzer software to measure the fibrotic area .

PCR product was recombined using BP Clonase™ II into the Gateway 1 pDONR™221 entry vector which upon sequence con - firmation , transferred via LR Clonase™ II to Gateway 1 pAd / CMV / V5 - DEST destination vec - tors , for transfection or transduction , respectively Isolation and culture of NRVCM and fibroblasts NRVCMs were isolated as described before [ 31 , 33 ] . In short , 1 – 2 days old Wistar rats ( Charles River ) were decapitated to obtain the hearts , which were stored in ice cold ADS buffer ( 120 mmol / L NaCl , 20 mmol / L HEPES , 8 mmol / L NaH2PO4 , 6 mmol / L glucose , 5 mmol / L KCl and 0 . 8 mmol / L MgSO4 ( pH 7 . 4 ) ) . The ventricles were minced with the scissor and digested 4 – 5 times in sterile ADS buffer containing collagenase type II ( 0 . 5 mg / mL , Worthington Bio - chemical Corporation ) and pancreatin ( 0 . 6 mg / mL , Sigma - Aldrich ) to separate the cells . By performing a gradient centrifugation using Percoll ( GE Healthcare ) , NRVCM were purified and separated from cardiac fibroblasts . The NRVCM were incubated at 37˚C in complete DMEM media ( DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS , 100 U / mL penicillin , 100 μg / mL strepto - mycin and 2 mmol / L L - glutamine ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) ) for 24h before virus transduc - tion or other downstream treatments . Fibroblast fraction from the gradient step mentioned above was plated in 6x well culture plates at 37˚C for 4 h in complete DMEM medium , fol - lowed by media aspiration and washing with PBS to remove floating contaminant cells . Adhered fibroblasts were incubated for further 96 h in complete DMEM at 37˚C .

Briefly , cardiomyocytes cultured on coverslips in 12x well culture plates , either transduced with Cfl2 overexpression / knockdown adenoviral particles , or transfected with miR - 301a mimic / inhibitor , were washed 2x with PBS and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for miR - 301aregulatesCofilin - 2in the heart PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0183901 September 8 , 2017 5 / 21 10 min . Fixed cells were washed 2x with PBS followed by a common step of permeabilization and blocking with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in 2 . 5 % BSA for 1 h at room temperature . Cells were then incubated for 1 h with primary anti – α - actinin antibody ( 1 : 200 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , 5x washes with PBS , followed by the incubation with respective secondary antibody conjugated to Cy3 ( Dianova ) and DAPI for nuclear staining . After washings with PBS , coverslips were mounted on glass - slides using Fluoromount ( Biozol ) . Immunofluorescence images were cap - tured using BZ - 9000 microscope ( Keyence ) . Cell surface area was measured using HybridCell - Count module BZ - II Analyzer software ( Keyence ) . Transfection of miR - 301 / anti - miR301 NRVCM were transfected 24h post seeding using Lipofectamine 1 RNAiMAX ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) to transfect microRNA miR - 301a mimic / inhibitor , or a control microRNA , as per manufacturer’s recommendation .

Used micro - RNA inhibitors : miRCURY LNA Inhibitor Negative Control A and hsa - miR - 301a ( both Exiqon ) . Generation of miR - 301a predicted binding site mutants and luciferase assay Murine genomic DNA was used as a template for cloning 3’ untranslated regions ( 3’UTR ) of the genes of interest into pmirGLO vector ( Promega ) . Mutants of the predicted binding sites in the 3’UTR of Cofilin - 2 were generated by QuikChange 1 II site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Agilent Technologies ) by replacing bases 2’ - 6’ of the seed sequence ( 5’GCACT - 3‘ to 5‘ - TAC AG - 3 ) . C2C12 cells ( 24 - well format , 30 . 000 cells / well ) were co - transfected with 20ng pmiR - GLO vector per well and mimics ( 20pmol / well , mirVana™ miRNA Mimic , Negative Control # 1 and miR - 301a - 3p , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) 24h post cell seeding and incubated for addi - tional 48h with one change of media .

As an indicator for the serum response factor ( SRF ) activity the pGL4 . 34 [ luc2P / SRF - RE / Hygro ] vector by Promega ( 20ng / well ) was used , which contains a SRF responsive element promotor prior to the firefly luciferase gene . For normalization , Renilla luciferase containing pGL4 . 74 [ hRluc / TK ] vector by Promega ( 5ng / well ) was used . These vectors were co - transfected with either Cofilin - 2 or miR - 301a knockdown ( Negative Control siRNA , Qiagen 1 ; Cofilin 2 siRNA ( m ) : sc - 37026 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , or over - expression constructs ( n = 6 ) using Lipofectamine 1 2000 Transfection Reagent ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) 24h after seeding the C2C12 cells . Cells were cultured for 48h , lysed and lucif - erase assay was performed as mentioned above for 3’UTR mutants . Reporter assays in the NRVCM were performed using SRF - RE driven firefly luciferase adenovirus construct as described in [ 32 ] . Adenovirus encoding Cfl2 or a synthetic microRNA specifically targeting Cfl2 was used for the overexpression or knockdown of Cfl2 , respectively . Statistical analysis The error bars represent the standard error of the mean ( SEM ) , unless stated otherwise . The statistical analysis was carried out using either two - tailed student’s t - test when comparing two groups . Equal distribution of the cell size measurement data was tested by Shapiro – Wilk test , and samples were compared by Kruskal - Wallis test ( one - way ANOVA on ranks ) . P - values (cid:20) 0 . 05 were considered as statistically significant . Results Calsarcin - 1 deficient mouse in pure C57BL / 6 genetic background displays dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype We have earlier reported that mice with Calsarcin - 1 null mutation in a mixed genetic back - ground do not exhibit any overt basal cardiac hypertrophy phenotype , however show acceler - ated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in response to pathological biomechanical stress [ 13 ] . We then back - crossed these mice for more than 10 generations to obtain Calsarcin - 1 deficiency in a pure C57BL / 6 genetic background ( henceforth these mice will be referred as Cs1 - ko ) . Using echocardiography analysis we found that Cs1 - ko mice showed severely reduced fractional shortening ( Fig 1A ) and intra - ventricular diameter ( Fig 1B ) , whereas , left ventricular end - dia - stolic diameter was significantly increased ( Fig 1C ) . Surprisingly however , there was no differ - ence between heart weight to body weight ( Fig 1D ) , and heart weight to tibia length ratios ( Fig 1E ) in Cs1 - ko mice . Moreover , in line with heart weight to body weight ratios , cardiomyo - cyte cell surface area was also unaltered between both the genotypes ( Fig 1F and 1G ) . Further - more , lack of Calsarcin - 1 did not increase fibrosis as evident from the unaltered fibrosis and unchanged expression of fibrosis markers , Collagen I and III ( Fig 1H – 1J ) . Altogether , these data suggests that Cs1 - ko mice in pure C57BL / 6 background displays strict dilated cardiomy - opathy phenotype . MicroRNA miR - 301a is downregulated in Cs1 - ko mice To understand the molecular causes of dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype of Cs1 - ko mice , we performed comparative microRNA microarray analysis of Cs1 - ko with wild - type mouse heart . Microarray data revealed that several microRNAs were dysregulated in Cs1 - ko mice ( S1 Table ) , including miR301a , which was maximally downregulated , whereas , miR - 298 was highly upregulated in Cs1 - ko mouse hearts ( schematically depicted in Fig 2A ) .

We selected few of the targets including Cofilin - 2 ( Cfl2 ) , Activin A Receptor Type 1 ( ACVR1 ) , Quaking ( Qk ) , and Chloride Voltage - Gated Channel - 3 ( CLCN3 ) for further validation using pmirGLO Dual - Luciferase miRNA Target Expression Vector and assay system . Luciferase activity was found to be reduced only in Cfl2 construct ( Fig 3A ) which led us evaluate its possible miR - 301a binding sites in details . We found four putative miR - 301a binding sites in 3’UTR of Cfl2 depicted in S1A Fig which we mutated by site directed mutagenesis and studied for the validation of miR - 301a binding . Mutation in two of the four putative binding sites ( binding sites at position 370 and 1030 of the 3’UTR ) pre - vented the reduction in luciferase activity by miR - 301a overexpression suggesting that these two binding sites are responsible for miR - 301a effect on Cfl2 expression ( Fig 3B ) . We then confirmed if miR - 301a targets Cfl2 in vitro in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes ( NRVCM ) . As anticipated , overexpression of miR - 301a reduced while its knockdown increased Cfl2 expression determined by immunoblotting ( Fig 3C – 3E ) . Finally , we found a strong in vivo correlation between downregulation of miR - 301a to the upregulation of Cfl2 in Cs1 - ko mice ( Fig 3F – 3H ) , suggesting a possible physiological importance of miR - 301a in regu - lating Cfl2 in the heart . determined by quantitative real - time PCR .

Cofilin - 2 is a target of miR - 301a .

Putative 3’UTR bindingsites from these targets was evaluatedusing pmirGLO Dual - Luciferase miRNA Target Expression Vector and assay system and found that only Cfl2 was a possible target ( N = 6 ) .

( S2 Fig ) . To discriminate the expression of miR - 301a and Cfl2 in cardiac major cell types , we studied their expression levels in isolated fibro - blasts and cardiomyocytes from neonatal rat ventricles . We found that the expression of both miR - 301a and Cfl2 was higher ( > 2 fold ) in cardiomyocytes compared to fibroblasts ( Fig 4A – 4C ) . Expression of α - actinin and vimentin were used as markers to determine the purity of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts , respectively ( Fig 4D – 4F ) . miR - 301a and Cfl2 oppositely regulates Rho - mediated SRF signaling but not cellular hypertrophy The ADF / cofilin family proteins are actin - binding that are actively involved in actin re - modeling . RhoA , a small Rho family GTPase and an activator of serum response factor ( SRF ) signaling has also been shown to play an essential role in the control of myocardial fibrosis by regulating cofilins [ 35 ] . We therefore hypothesized that Cfl2 plays an essential role in RhoA - SRF activation and miR - 301a will negatively affect this activation by regulating Cfl2 expres - sion . To test this hypothesis , we performed SRF - response element ( SRF - RE ) driven firefly luciferase activity assay by either overexpressing or knocking down Cfl2 / miR - 301a in C2C12 cells . Overexpression of Cfl2 alone did not regulate the luciferase activity ( Fig 5A ) . Surprisingly however , co - expression of Cfl2 and RhoA ( both constitutively active and native RhoA ) dra - matically increased the activation of luciferase reporter ( Fig 5A ) . In contrast , knockdown of Cfl2 strongly attenuated the luciferase activity not only at basal level , but also inhibited the RhoA - mediated SRF - RE activation ( Fig 5B ) suggesting that Cfl2 is necessary and sufficient for the SRF - signaling activation through RhoA . In contrast , downregulation of miR - 301a resulted in the activation , whereas , its overexpression significantly blunted the basal as well as RhoA - mediated activation of SRF - RE signaling ( Fig 5C and 5D ) . Importantly , strong effect on RhoA - mediated SRF activation via Cfl2 overexpression observed in C2C12 cells was consistent in cardiomyocytes as well ( Fig 5E ) . Knockdown of Cfl2 also significantly blunted the activation of luciferase activity , both at baseline as well as in the presence of RhoA ( Fig 5F ) . Similarly , inhibition of miR - 301a expression effectively accelerated SRF - signaling at basal level ( Fig 5G ) , whereas , its overexpression significantly abrogated the RhoA - mediated activation of SRF activ - ity ( Fig 5H ) . Finally , we evaluated if Cfl2 / miR - 301a influences cellular hypertrophy by measur - ing cell surface area . To our surprise , neither overexpression nor knockdown of Cfl2 or miR - 301a affected the cell size in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes ( Fig 5I – 5L ) . Calsarcin - 1 deficiency upregulates SRF in mouse heart Due to the significant effect of Cfl2 and miR - 301a on RhoA / SRF - signaling in C2C12 cells / NRVCM , and observed upregulation of Cfl2 and downregulation of miR - 301a in Cs1 - ko mice , these bindingsites act as targets for miR - 301abinding . Mutationsin binding sites 370 and 1030 resulted in loss of luciferaseactivation , clearly suggesting that these two sites act as bindingsites for miR - 301a ( N = 4 ) .

We found considerable increase in the expression of both SRF and RhoA in Cs1 - ko mice compared to the respective wild - type lit - termates ( Fig 6A – 6C ) . Increased levels of SRF in the heart is known to cause robust activation of SRF signaling , and in the absence of other stimuli , SRF upregulation is sufficient to cause cardiomyopathy [ 17 ] . Along these lines , the expression of fetal genes nppa , nppb , and myh7 , which are also direct targets of SRF transcription factor were dramatically increased in the heart of Cs1 - ko mice ( Fig 6D – 6F ) . Furthermore , actc1 was also highly upregulated ( Fig 6G ) , which is a bona fide target of SRF . Taken together , these data suggests an increased activation of SRF - signaling in Cs1 - ko mice .

Through a microRNA microarray we identified miR - 301a is significantly downregulated in Calsarcin - 1 deficient mice that present DCM phenotype in a pure C57BL / 6 background . Functional characterization of this microRNA in cardiac perspective revealed that miR - 301a targets and regulates Cfl2 in vitro in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes , and in vivo in Cs1 - ko mice . Furthermore , our in vitro data indi - cated that miR - 301a attenuates RhoA - mediated activation of SRF signaling via targeting Cfl2 in vitro without affecting cellular hypertrophy . Importantly , RhoA , SRF and its target genes were strongly upregulated in Cs1 - ko mice where Cfl2 is upregulated and miR - 301a is downregulated , suggesting a possible involvement of Cfl2 in SRF activation in vivo . Natural genetic diversity in human population determines the extent of disease phenotype , including cardiac diseases , suggesting that genetic background also plays an important role in pathology . Similarly , increasing number of studies suggests the importance of selecting an appropriate mouse genetic background for cardiac evaluations [ 36 , 37 ] . For example , ApoE knockout mouse displays severe atherosclerotic phenotype in C57BL / 6 compared to FVB / J , whereas , MLP knockout has dramatically increased heart failure rate in the 129 / Sv than C57BL / 6 genetic background [ 38 , 39 ] . Similarly , Lygate et al . ascertained that mitochondrial Fig 6 . Calsarcin - 1deficiency upregulates SRF in mouse heart . ( A ) SRF and RhoA are upregulatedin Cs1 - ko mice as depictedin an immunoblot ( N = 3 ( WT ) , 4 ( Cs1 - ko ) , originaluncroppedblots are shown in S3 Fig , respectivedensitometries are shown as bar graphs in B and C ) .

Similarly cardiac muscle α - actin ( actc1 ) was highlyupregulatedin Cs1 - ko mice . N = 5 ( WT ) and 6 ( Cs1 - ko ) . The statistical analysiswas carried out using two - tailed student’s t - test . * : p < 0 . 05 , † : p < 0 . 01 , ‡ : p < 0 . 001 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0183901 . g006 miR - 301aregulatesCofilin - 2in the heart PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0183901 September 8 , 2017 14 / 21 creatine kinase knockout mice do not display any cardiac phenotype in pure C57BL / 6 genetic background [ 40 ] , which earlier reportedly led to LV dysfunction and hypertrophy [ 41 ] . In con - gruence with these reports , we previously found that Calsarcin - 1 knockout mice do not exhibit cardiac hypertrophy phenotype at baseline in mixed genetic background notwithstanding striking upregulation of fetal genes and contractile dysfunction ; however , these mice displayed strict DCM phenotype , devoid of hypertrophy , even when back - crossed for more than 10 gen - erations to obtain the desired mutation in pure C57BL / 6 background . Therefore , to identify the molecular causes behind DCM phenotype despite lack of hypertrophy , we performed microRNA microarray which resulted in identification of several microRNAs that were differ - entially regulated in Cs1 - ko mice . MicroRNAs play crucial role in cardiac regeneration , energy homeostasis , and regulating cardiac physiology by targeting and fine - tuning the expression of several important transcrip - tion factors , cytoskeletal proteins , etc . [ 42 – 47 ] . Therefore , dysregulation of ( a ) microRNA ( s ) due to extrinsic and / or intrinsic stress further adds to the severity of the disease [ 48 – 50 ] . This very fact can and is being capitalized for the potential therapeutic uses of microRNAs against cardiac diseases [ 43 , 48 , 51 – 55 ] . Present study is conceived to identify the dysregulated micro - RNA ( s ) , in Cs1 - ko mice that developed dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype . Our microarray analysis revealed deregulation of many microRNAs ( S1 Table ) . Few of the highly upregulated microRNAs were : miR - 79 , miR - 183 , miR - 206 , miR - 207 , miR - 296 - 3p , miR - 298 , miR - 380 - 5p , miR - 433 , miR - 449b , miR - 705 , miR - 761 ( S1 Table ) . MiR - 206 and miR - 298 are previously shown to be upregulated in rat model of post - infarction heart failure [ 50 ] . However , circulat - ing levels of miR - 296 and miR - 433 were found to be downregulated in hypertension and con - genital heart disease , respectively [ 56 , 57 ] . MicroRNAs like miR - 19a , 34b , 129 , 135a , 142 - 3p , miR - 153 , miR - 186 , miR - 187 , and miR - 301a were significantly downregulated in Cs1 - ko mice . Zhu et al . has recently demonstrated that increased expression of miR - 135a , protects diabetic mice against ischemia / reperfusion injury [ 58 ] . Circulating levels of miR - 129 and miR - 142 were reduced in congestive heart failure [ 59 , 60 ] . Majority of the dysregulated microRNAs e . g . miR - 380 , miR - 207 , miR - 79 , miR - 129 , miR - 153 , miR - 183 , etc . identified through our microar - ray analysis have not been associated with any cardiac anomaly yet , which can be characterized further for their potential role in the heart . MiR - 301a , the most - downregulated microRNA in our screen has previously been associ - ated strongly with many human cancers including prostate cancer , malignant melanoma , oste - osarcoma , etc . [ 61 – 64 ] . Although miR - 301a is significantly expressed in the heart and other tissues , no cardiac role of this ubiquitously expressed microRNA is known yet . Moreover , we here found that miR - 301a was highly expressed in isolated cardiomyocyte compared to fibro - blasts , suggesting a cell - type specific function for this microRNA . Most interestingly , we discovered Cofilin - 2 as one of the putative targets of miR - 301a through microRNA target data - base search , which we further validated through series of experiments including luciferase assays , site directed mutagenesis of possible binding sites , and by manipulation of miR - 301a expressions in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes . To strengthen these in vitro findings , we found a strong inverse correlation between Cfl2 and miR - 301a expression in Cs1 - ko mice . Cfl2 belongs to the family of actin severing proteins , primarily expressed in muscle , and also in the brain and liver [ 23 ] , and is critical for the maintenance of sarcomeric actin dynam - ics and length [ 26 , 27 ] . However , our data indicates that Cfl2 overexpression does not signifi - cantly alter the cell surface area of isolated NRVCM . Ablation of miR - 301a resulted into similar effects as observed with the Cfl2 overexpression , pertaining to the increased levels of Cfl2 upon miR - 301a knockdown . We also found that Cfl2 increases the RhoA - mediated SRF activation , whereas , miR - 301a upregulation is sufficient to antagonize these effects ( Fig 7 ) . Moreover , increased expression of SRF / RhoA in Cs1 - ko mice and target genes of SRF miR - 301aregulatesCofilin - 2in the heart PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0183901 September 8 , 2017 15 / 21 suggesting activation of SRF signaling in these mice . Of note , Cs1 - ko mice do not exhibit any signs of hypertrophy notwithstanding upregulation of fetal gene program and contractile dys - function . Similar findings were observed when we modulated the expression of Cfl2 or miR - 301a . Overexpression of Cfl2 or knockdown of miR - 301a though resulted in the activation of SRF signaling , neither of these treatments caused hypertrophy . These similar in vitro findings points towards possible involvement of Cfl2 - miR301a in the pathophysiology of Cs1 - ko mice , at least partially . Recently , increased expression and phosphorylation of Cfl2 has been linked with DCM and myocardial aggregates [ 28 ] . Surprisingly , deletion of Cfl2 in mice also led to progressive muscle degeneration and appearance of sarcoplasmic protein aggregates [ 65 ] . Both these findings highlight the importance of Cfl2 in muscle and heart pathophysiology . Here , we show that miR - 301a regulates the expression as well as physiological function of Cfl2 in cultured cardiomyocytes , which needs additional in vivo evaluations and validation by gain - and loss - of - function studies . We therefore propose to explore the possibility of use of miR - 301a manipulations for therapeutic intervention to target cardiac disorders caused due to deregulation of Cfl2 .
