The molecular mechanisms underlying yttrium toxicity must be delineated . We considered the genomic phenotyping of a mutant collection of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to be of particular interest to decipher key cellular pathways involved either in yttrium toxicity or detoxiﬁcation mechanisms . Among the 4733 mutants exposed to yttrium , 333 exhibited modiﬁed growth , of which 56 were sensitive and 277 were resistant . Several functions involved in yttrium toxicity mitigation emerged , primarily vacuolar acidiﬁcation and retrograde transport . Conversely , functional categories overrepresented in the yttrium toxicity response included cytoskeleton organization and endocytosis , protein transport and vesicle trafﬁcking , lipid metabolism , as well as signaling pathways . Comparison with similar studies carried out using other metals and stressors showed a response pattern similar to nickel stress . One third of the identiﬁed mutants highlighted peculiar cellular effects triggered by yttrium , speciﬁcally those affecting the pheromone - dependent signaling pathway or sphingolipid metabolic processes . Taken together , these data emphasize the role of the plasma membrane as a hotspot for yttrium toxicity . The up - to - now lack of data concerning yttrium toxicity at the cellular and molecular levels makes this pioneer study using the model S . cerevisiae an excellent ﬁrst basis for the assessment of yttrium toxicity toward eukaryotes . Keywords : genome - wide screening , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , technology critical element , yeast mutants , yttrium toxicity INTRODUCTION Mainly mined in China , which possesses the largest deposits , and lower proportions in India , Brazil , and Malaysia , yttrium is a metallic element belonging to the group of rare earth elements ( REE ) . Yttrium is naturally present in the earth crust with an abundance similar to cobalt , zinc , copper , chromium , or lead ( Haxel et al . , 2002 ) . This element displays unique and essential properties for diverse technologies and is therefore considered a technology - critical element ( TCE ) . The main use of yttrium is for phosphor production ( 54 % ) and , to a lesser extent , in white LED lights and ceramic production ( 32 % ) ( Ciacci et al . , 2015 ) . Additional minor uses are also reported , such as additives to improve glass resistance or mechanical properties of alloys , in some lasers , as a catalyst in ethylene polymerization , or in cancer treatment using the radioactive isotope yttrium - 90 ( Riaz et al . , 2014 ) . Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 1 September 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2005 fmicb - 09 - 02005 August 31 , 2018 Time : 18 : 35 # 2 Grosjean et al . Yttrium Responsive Genes in Yeast According to the expansion of these high technology - related needs , annual yttrium production is strikingly rising . It rose from 2400 t / year in 1998 ( United States Geological Survey , 2000 ) to 8000 – 10 , 000 t / year in 2015 ( United States Geological Survey , 2016 ) . As a consequence , high residual yttrium concentrations ( e . g . , from 148 to 330 ppm in the A layer and from 60 to 242 ppm in the B layer in soil samples from Chinese mining sites ) can be found at REE - mining sites ( Wei et al . , 2001 ) . Additionally , other anthropogenic activities also contribute to the spreading of yttrium in the environment . Deposits from the combustion of coal still signiﬁcantly contribute to the dissemination of yttrium worldwide , with concentrations ranging from 94 to 3540 ppm ( mean 408 ) in coal ash and 191 – 259 ppm in coal ﬂy ash ( Mayﬁeld and Lewis , 2013 ) . Moreover , up to 110 ppm yttrium can be found in phosphate rocks ( Bunus , 2000 ) . In addition to the increasing demand and spread , another major drawback is the lack of sustainable processes for the recycling of end - use products containing this element . Taken together , these observations suggest that yttrium is an emerging contaminant for the environment ( Ciacci et al . , 2015 ) . Few studies are currently available regarding the eﬀect of TCE on the environment or on organisms , despite its increasing abundance . To date , the scarce data concerning yttrium toxicity ( Hirano et al . , 1993 ; Li et al . , 2015 ; Zhang et al . , 2016 ; Trifuoggi et al . , 2017 ; Wang Y . M . et al . , 2017 ) mostly focus either on yttrium nanoparticles ( Zhang et al . , 2016 ; Zhou et al . , 2016 ) or indirect eﬀects caused by the use of the radioactive isotope yttrium - 90 ( Riaz et al . , 2014 ) . Although yttrium toxicity has been observed for some organisms , the associated detrimental mechanisms remain unknown ( Hirano et al . , 1993 ; Li et al . , 2015 ; Zhang et al . , 2016 ; Trifuoggi et al . , 2017 ; Wang Y . M . et al . , 2017 ) . Thus , there is a strong interest in unraveling the potential toxicological eﬀects of these elements on well - known organisms to build a general and robust knowledge . The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been widely used as a model to uncover metal toxicity mechanisms as well as pathways that allow eukaryotes to cope with toxic metals . As an example , unprogrammed gene silencing , a major mechanism of nickel toxicity and carcinogenicity in humans , was also identiﬁed in S . cerevisiae ( Lee et al . , 1995 ; Broday et al . , 1999 ; Sutherland et al . , 2001 ; Costa et al . , 2005 ) . Those ﬁndings further support the use of S . cerevisiae as a model organism to elucidate metal toxicity mechanisms in humans due to the high conservation of such mechanisms between these organisms . Genomic phenotyping of knock - out ( KO ) mutant collections is a method of choice to decipher general functions as well as key genes involved in metal homeostasis in S . cerevisiae . This experimental approach has been widely applied , since the KO mutant collection release for various metals such as cadmium ( Ruotolo et al . , 2008 ; Serero et al . , 2008 ; Thorsen et al . , 2009 ; Wang , L . et al . , 2017 ) , nickel ( Ruotolo et al . , 2008 ; Arita et al . , 2009 ; Bleackley et al . , 2011 ) , zinc ( Pagani et al . , 2007 ; Wang et al . , 2007 ; Jin et al . , 2008 ; Bleackley et al . , 2011 ) , aluminum ( Kakimoto et al . , 2005 ; Tun et al . , 2014 ) , arsenic ( Haugen et al . , 2004 ; Thorsen et al . , 2006 , 2009 ; Jin et al . , 2008 ; Ruotolo et al . , 2008 ; Serero et al . , 2008 ; Johnson et al . , 2016a ) , copper ( Wang et al . , 2007 ; Jo et al . , 2008 ; Bleackley et al . , 2011 ) , iron ( Wang et al . , 2007 ; Jo et al . , 2008 ; Bleackley et al . , 2011 ) , manganese ( Wang et al . , 2007 ; Bleackley et al . , 2011 ; Chesi et al . , 2012 ) , cobalt ( Bleackley et al . , 2011 ) , or chromium ( Jin et al . , 2008 ; Johnson et al . , 2016b ) among others . The identiﬁed mechanisms thanks to this model organism and approach have provided insights into conserved pathways in other eukaryotes ( Botstein et al . , 1997 ; Kachroo et al . , 2017 ) . In this study , the knock - out mutant collection of the haploid strain BY4741 from EUROSCARF was screened to identify both sensitive and resistant mutants to yttrium . The yttrium - speciﬁc response was analyzed by comparisons between our set of data with those from previous phenotypic screens on other metals or stressors . The cellular compartments and functions involved in the response to yttrium exposure were investigated in detail , shedding light for the ﬁrst time on molecular responses toward this emerging contaminant . MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast Strains and Chemicals The wild - type BY4741 strain of S . cerevisiae ( MATa his3 (cid:49) 1 leu2 (cid:49) 0 met15 (cid:49) 0 ura3 (cid:49) 0 ) and the complete set of 4733 deletion mutants for non - essential genes used in this study were purchased from EUROSCARF ( Institute of Molecular Biosciences , Frankfurt , Germany ) . Mutants of the S . cerevisiae BY4742 strain ( MAT α his3 (cid:49) 1 leu2 (cid:49) 0 lys2 (cid:49) 0 ura3 (cid:49) 0 ) were also purchased from EUROSCARF . Yttrium ( III ) chloride hexahydrate ( 99 . 9 % purity , # 211648 ) was from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO , United States ) . Yttrium Toxicity Screening The wild - type strain and the deletion mutants , arrayed in 96 - well master plates , were grown in 200 µ L of YPD ( 10 g . L − 1 peptone , 20 g . L − 1 glucose , and 10 g . L − 1 yeast extract ) medium until stationary phase at 28 ◦ C . A ﬁrst screening for the identiﬁcation of Y - resistant and Y - sensitive mutants was carried out by comparing their growth ( respectively , increased or impaired ) to that of the wild - type on a toxic yttrium concentration . In more detail , the strains were pin replicated using a Thermo Scientiﬁc TM Nunc TM Replication System ( 250520 ) on YPD agar plates or on the same medium supplemented with 3 . 75 mM yttrium chloride , allowing us to visually identify in a single step both resistant and sensitive strains . Four pin replications were performed for each mutant . Growth was recorded after 5 days at 28 ◦ C . In a second screening , the previously selected mutants were individually retested to conﬁrm their sensitive or resistant phenotype by 10 - fold serial dilution spot assays . The mutant and the wild - type strains were grown as described above , and 5 µ L of stationary cultures were further diluted from 10 0 to 10 − 5 and spotted on YPD agar plates supplemented with 100 % ( 3 . 75 mM ) and 105 % ( 3 . 90 mM ) of the yttrium concentration used in the ﬁrst screening . These concentrations were chosen to discriminate the diﬀerent sensitivity and resistance levels , respectively , as deﬁned below . Growth was recorded after 7 days at 28 ◦ C . Sensitivity and resistance levels were assigned to the mutant strains , according to the number of growing dilutions . Consequently , mutant strains exhibiting a reduction in Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 2 September 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2005 fmicb - 09 - 02005 August 31 , 2018 Time : 18 : 35 # 3 Grosjean et al . Yttrium Responsive Genes in Yeast colony - forming ability at the ﬁrst , second - third , or fourth - ﬁfth dilution were classiﬁed as “high” ( HS ) , “medium” ( MS ) , or “low” ( LS ) sensitive to yttrium , respectively . Conversely , mutant strains exhibiting an increase in colony - forming ability at the second , third - fourth , or ﬁfth - sixth dilution were classiﬁed as “low” ( LR ) , “medium” ( MR ) , or “high” ( HR ) resistant to yttrium , respectively . Finally , a set of 20 mutants , randomly chosen in the diﬀerent sensitivity / resistance categories , was conﬁrmed in the parent MAT α BY4742 background . Gene and Function Annotation Gene descriptions corresponding to the Y - sensitive and Y - resistant mutants were retrieved from the Saccharomyces Genome Database ( SGD ) 1 . Biological process as well as cellular compartment analyses were performed using KEGG 2 , MIPS , Gene Ontology [ GO Term Finder Program ( Boyle et al . , 2004 ) ] and FunSpec 3 and evaluated for statistical signiﬁcance ( cutoﬀ : P < 0 . 01 ) . The Y mutant set comparisons with other screenings were carried out by cluster analyses using Cluster 3 . 0 ( Hoon et al . , 2004 ) and Java Treeview 1 . 1 . 6r 4 . Hierarchical clustering was performed with the following parameters : average linkage , uncentered correlation , and k - mean = 10 when stated . To achieve this analysis , data sets were retrieved from previous genomic phenotyping studies and used if a suﬃcient number ( > 50 ) of mutants was identiﬁed . When several independent studies performed similar screenings on the same stressor , the corresponding lists of mutants were combined . Putative Human orthologs of yeast genes and any of their associated OMIM ( Hamosh et al . , 2005 ) disease phenotypes were retrieved from the SGD YeastMine platform 5 . Functional Enrichment Analysis The biological pathways that showed enrichment in the yttrium stress condition vs . control were identiﬁed using GSEA software v2 . 0 ( Subramanian et al . , 2005 ) . The sensitivity and resistance of each mutant was binary encoded to − 1 and + 1 , respectively , for gene ranking . S . cerevisiae GO ( biological process ) derived from the MSigDB format gene - sets list was downloaded from the GO2Msig ( Powell , 2014 ) database and used as a template . The gene set sizes retrieved from GO2Msig datasets were limited to a maximum of 150 and a minimum of 15 . Cytoscape v3 . 4 software ( Shannon et al . , 2003 ) and the Enrichment Map v2 . 1 . 0 ( Merico et al . , 2010 ) plug - in with default settings were used to visualize the GSEA results . RESULTS Genomic Phenotyping of Yttrium Toxicity Phenotypic screening of the whole haploid KO mutant collection of S . cerevisiae strain BY4741 allowed the identiﬁcation of 1 http : / / www . yeastgenome . org 2 http : / / www . genome . jp / kegg / 3 http : / / funspec . med . utoronto . ca 4 http : / / jtreeview . sourceforge . net 5 http : / / yeastmine . yeastgenome . org / yeastmine / mutants with modiﬁed growth compared with the wild - type strain when exposed to the TCE yttrium ( Figure 1 ) . The second screening showed that the number of false positives picked from the ﬁrst screening was relatively low ( 10 % of the total set ) ( data not shown ) . Among the 333 conﬁrmed Y - responsive mutants , 56 were sensitive while ﬁve times as many ( 277 ) exhibited a resistant phenotype ( Figure 2 ) . Following the second screening , mutants were classiﬁed into six diﬀerent categories by their degree of sensitivity / resistance relative to the wild - type strain [ spanning from highly sensitive ( HS ) to highly resistant ( HR ) mutants ] ( Figure 1 ) . Among the resistant mutants , 14 . 8 % , named in Figure 2 , were HR . The proportion was similar ( 16 . 1 % ) for HS mutants . The number of low ( LR ) and medium ( MR ) resistant mutants accounted for 44 . 0 and 41 . 2 % of the total resistant set , respectively . Similarly , the number of low ( LS ) and medium ( MS ) sensitive mutants represented 41 . 1 and 42 . 8 % of the sensitive mutants , respectively ( Figure 2 ) . Yttrium sensitivity or resistance phenotypes were conﬁrmed using randomly chosen mutants , by independent serial dilution assays carried out on mutant strains of the opposite mating type ( BY4742 ) ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . A total of 29 mutants for dubious proteins ( 8 % ) and 22 for uncharacterized ORFs ( 6 % ) were included in the 333 mutants ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Further examination of the details of cellular compartments related to these mutants allowed the identiﬁcation of hotspots for either yttrium toxicity or detoxiﬁcation . From enquiries of the MIPS subcellular localization database , the following subsequent cellular compartments were predominantly represented : endosome ( P < 1 . 00e − 14 , 22 mutants out of 57 ) , vacuole ( P = 4 . 07e − 05 , 26 out of 224 ) , Golgi apparatus ( P = 4 . 24e − 04 , 16 out of 125 ) , endoplasmic reticulum membrane ( P = 5 . 29e − 03 , 14 out of 131 ) , and Golgi - ER transport vesicles ( P = 9 . 10e − 03 , 8 out of 60 ) ( Table 1 ) . For the Y - resistant mutants , endosome ( P = 4 . 53e − 13 , 19 out of 57 ) , vacuole ( P = 2 . 30e − 03 , 19 out of 224 ) , and plasma membrane ( P = 9 . 25e − 03 , 15 out of 184 ) were clearly mostly impacted , while for sensitive mutants , vacuole ( P = 2 . 14e − 03 , 7 out of 224 ) and Golgi ( P = 3 . 38e − 03 , 5 out of 125 ) were emphasized ( Table 1 ) . Interestingly , compartments such as mitochondria and nucleus were not signiﬁcantly represented ( Table 1 ) . As a good eukaryotic model , the OMIM human - related diseases tool from the SGD yeastMine platform allowed the identiﬁcation of human orthologs and associated disease phenotypes . One or more human orthologs were found for up to 188 of the 333 genes ( 56 . 5 % ) for which deletion rendered the mutant strains resistant or sensitive to yttrium . As high as 59 of these genes ( 17 . 7 % ) are involved in human diseases , such as cancer ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Comparison of Cellular Toxicity Signatures Between Yttrium and Other Metals A comparison of the present Y dataset with other genome - wide deletion mutant screenings carried out on other metals ( Cd , Cr , Ni , Cu , Fe , Co , Zn , Mn ) and metalloid ( As ) is provided ( Figure 3 ) . Excluding Cu , few sensitive mutants ( 13 ) grouped Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 3 September 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2005 fmicb - 09 - 02005 August 31 , 2018 Time : 18 : 35 # 4 Grosjean et al . Yttrium Responsive Genes in Yeast FIGURE 1 | Representative primary screen data for yttrium - responsive mutants and phenotypic conﬁrmation of the identiﬁed mutants . ( A ) Representative 384 - well format growth test for the yttrium toxicity primary screen ( four pin replication of each mutant ) . A control plate ( YPD medium ) and the same plate supplemented with 3 . 75 mM yttrium are shown . Putative yttrium sensitive ( blue ) and resistant mutants ( orange ) are highlighted . ( B ) Phenotypic conﬁrmation of selected sensitive and resistant mutants . Wild - type and mutant strains were grown without or with yttrium . Yttrium sensitivity was determined by 10 - fold serially diluted spot assays ( left to right ) with saturation phase grown cells . Mutant strains exhibiting a reduction in colony - forming ability at the ﬁrst , second - third or fourth - ﬁfth dilution were classiﬁed as “high” ( HS ) , “medium” ( MS ) , or “low” ( LS ) sensitive to yttrium , respectively . Conversely , mutant strains exhibiting an increase in colony - forming ability at the second , third - fourth , or ﬁfth - sixth dilution were classiﬁed as “low” ( LR ) , “medium” ( MR ) , or “high” ( HR ) resistant to yttrium , respectively . FIGURE 2 | Distribution and ranking of yttrium - responsive mutants . The middle pie chart shows the overall number of resistant ( orange ) and sensitive ( blue ) mutants . Detailed proportions of the different categories low ( LR ) , medium ( MR ) , high ( HR ) resistant mutants ( left ) and low ( LS ) , medium ( MS ) , and high ( HS ) sensitive mutants ( right ) are shown . ORF names of HR and HS mutants are mentioned . together regardless of the metallic species tested , highlighting common response pathways ( cluster C1 ) . These shared mutants were notably involved in a global cellular response to metallic stressors such as vacuolar acidiﬁcation ( VMA mutants ) and response to DNA damage stimulus . Cluster C3 contained 14 mutants that were sensitive to all metals but Ni , and involved in retrograde transport , Golgi to vacuole transport and glycosphingolipid process . A wide range of resistant mutants ( 106 ) were speciﬁc to yttrium stress ( cluster C6 ) and belonged to diﬀerent biological processes spanning the response to pheromone to the sphingolipid metabolic pathway ( Figure 3 ) . Regarding mutants with an opposite behavior between yttrium and other metallic species , only three mutants were sensitive to yttrium but resistant toward other metals ( (cid:49) Smf2 , (cid:49) Bud19 , and (cid:49) Sin4 ) , whereas 179 mutants were resistant to yttrium but sensitive to at least one other metal ( clusters C4 - C5 - C7 - C8 - C9 - C10 ) . Among the latter , several biological processes were represented , mostly belonging to the lipid and fatty acid biosynthetic processes but also to the actin ﬁlament / cytoskeleton organization and endocytosis ( Figure 3 ) . It is noteworthy that the highest similarities were shared between yttrium and nickel ( Figure 3 ) . Eighty - ﬁve mutants displayed a modiﬁed phenotype toward both elements , either with the same or opposite behavior . More striking were the 39 mutants that were resistant to both nickel and yttrium ( C8 - C9 ) but sensitive to other elements . These mutants belonged mainly to the ubiquitin - dependent protein catabolic process via the multivesicular body ( MVB ) sorting pathway ( P < 1 . 00e − 14 ) , including (cid:49) Stp22 , (cid:49) Doa4 , (cid:49) Vps25 , (cid:49) Did4 , (cid:49) Snf7 , (cid:49) Srn2 , (cid:49) Vps36 , (cid:49) Vps20 , (cid:49) Snf8 , and (cid:49) Vps28 . The proteins encoded by these genes are involved in the ESCRT complex and in protein traﬃcking .

The number of mutants within each cluster or function is speciﬁed in brackets . Functions considered were retrieved from FunSpec ( biological process GO terms , P < 0 . 01 ) . The hierarchical clustering was done with the following parameters : average linkage , uncentered correlation , k - mean = 10 . Comparison of Cellular Toxicity Signatures Between Yttrium and Other Stressors The same comparative approach was undertaken to investigate putative correlations / convergences between yttrium and gamma - rays , alkaline pH , or oxidative stress induced by a set of chemicals ( Bennett et al . , 2001 ; Chang et al . , 2002 ; Aouida et al . , 2004 ; Serrano et al . , 2004 ; Thorpe et al . , 2004 ; Figure 4 ) . Interestingly , three diﬀerent patterns could be observed . First , only a few mutants ( 40 ) shared a sensitive phenotype between yttrium and at least one of these other stressors . Second , 115 mutants that were sensitive to those stressors were resistant to yttrium . Third , the majority of the mutants ( 176 ) identiﬁed in this study were only responding to yttrium ( Figure 4 ) .

Yttrium Responsive Genes in Yeast FIGURE 4 | Hierarchical clustering of yttrium sensitivity or resistance - conferring mutations with the mutant sensitivity / resistance proﬁles of other stressors . The x - axis corresponds to gene deletions , and the y - axis represents the different physico - chemical stressors . Mutant strains exhibiting either a higher sensitivity , a higher resistance , or no phenotype change when compared to wild - type are shown in blue , orange , and gray , respectively . Non - metal stressors were selected from previous genomic phenotyping screenings conducted on deletion mutant collections . Methyl methane sulfonate ( MMS ) , gamma - radiation ( γ - ray ) , alkaline pH ( pH ) , menadione ( Men ) , hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) , cumene hydroperoxide ( CHP ) , linoleic acid 13 - hydroperoxide ( LoaOOH ) , and diamide ( DM ) . Hierarchical clustering was done with the following parameters : average linkage and uncentered correlation . Mutations Accounting for Yttrium Sensitivity To assess the global cell response to yttrium , functions involved in yttrium toxicity ( resistant mutants ) or yttrium resistance ( sensitive mutants ) mechanisms were revealed by functional enrichment analysis by combining both GO term ﬁnder and GSEA approaches ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 3 ) . In this sub - section , we focus on the description of sensitive mutants , the growth of which was partially or completely inhibited by yttrium exposure . The nine mutants displaying an exacerbated sensitivity ( HS mutants ) ( Figure 2 ) were considered to participate in either the glycosphingolipid metabolic / biosynthetic process ( P = 3 . 82e − 04 ) or cellular chemical homeostasis ( P = 3 . 82e − 03 ) ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . From the entire set of mutants , two mutants ( (cid:49) Sur1 and (cid:49) Csg2 ) that were sensitive to yttrium were impaired in the glycosphingolipid biosynthetic process ( P = 1 . 96e − 04 ) ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Sur1p ( also known as Csg1p ) is a mannosylinositol phosphorylceramide ( MIPC ) synthase catalytic subunit that forms a complex with the regulatory subunit Csg2p to act as an inositol phosphorylceramide mannosyltransferase complex . Ion homeostasis consisted of only sensitive mutants ( Figure 5 ) . It embodied three diﬀerent GO terms identiﬁed as vacuolar proton - transporting V - type ATPase complex assembly ( P = 3 . 90e − 04 ) , vacuolar acidiﬁcation ( P = 1 . 18e − 03 ) , and ATP hydrolysis coupled proton transport ( P = 8 . 25e − 03 ) . The only representatives of the VMA family genes were vma21 , vma22 , vma7 , and vma16 ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . As high as 25 % of the total sensitive mutants belonged to the transport function ( P = 4 . 79e − 03 , 14 genes out of 815 ) ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . A signiﬁcant proportion of sensitive mutants consisted of proteins that participate in vesicle transport from both the endosome to the trans - Golgi ( P = 3 . 87e − 04 ) and from the Golgi to the vacuole ( P = 3 . 76e − 05 ) ( Figure 6 and Supplementary Table 3 ) . The GARP ( Golgi Associated Retrograde Protein ) complex is responsible for vesicles fusion from the endosome to the trans - Golgi ( Figure 6A ) . Mutants for VPS54 , VPS52 , and VPS51 , three components of the GARP complex , were particularly sensitive to yttrium ( Figure 6B ) . The retrograde transport , which includes the GARP complex , allows the traﬃcking of extracellular molecules as well as the plasma membrane internalized by endocytosis to the trans - Golgi , thus participating in the recycling of either proteins or lipids from the membrane ( Figure 6A ) . Although endocytosis ( P = 4 . 36e − 03 ) was also involved , it was represented by only 4 sensitive mutants (cid:49) Cdc50 , (cid:49) Rcy1 , (cid:49) Vps1 , and (cid:49) Tlg2 ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . As part of the SNARE complex ( Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor ) , Tlg2p is also involved in vesicle fusion to the trans - Golgi along with the GARP complex ( Burri and Lithgow , 2004 ; Figure 6B ) . Both Cdc50p and Rcy1p are not only involved in the polarized growth of S . cerevisiae , but they also play a role in recycling plasma membrane proteins internalized by endocytosis . In the same way , Vps1p , a dynamin - like GTPase , is required for actin cytoskeleton organization and endocytosis . Linked to previously unraveled functions , 11 mutants impaired in protein transport ( P = 1 . 97e − 04 ) were also sensitive to yttrium . The corresponding proteins were involved at diﬀerent levels in the protein transport machinery ( Supplementary Table 3 ) , as illustrated by the following cases . Pep3p as part of the CORVET membrane tethering complex ( class C core vacuole / endosome tethering ) , is involved in vesicular docking fusion together with SNARE protein ( Tlg2p ) , allowing vacuolar biogenesis . The (cid:49) Apl2 mutant was also sensitive to yttrium ( Figure 6B ) . The latter protein is a subunit of the clathrin - associated protein ( AP - 1 ) complex that is involved in clathrin - dependent Golgi protein sorting . Lst4p , for its part , is required for the transport of an amino acid permease from the Golgi to the cell surface . Finally , Cog1p acts in protein traﬃcking by mediating the fusion of transport vesicles to Golgi compartments . Among the group of mutants that were identiﬁed from the present screening , four mutants for protein components of nuclear and mitochondrial ribosomal subunits displayed a sensitive phenotype ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Mrpl27p , a component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit , Rps16ap and Rps19bp , which are part of the nuclear small ribosomal subunit , and Rpp2bp , a component of the ribosomal stalk . Mutations Accounting for Yttrium Resistance Many additional yttrium - resistant over sensitive mutants ensued from the screening . Mutants were considered resistant if their growth was improved compared with the wild - type strain under yttrium exposure . This phenotype indicated a key role of the deleted gene in yttrium cell toxicity since its absence allowed the yeast cells to better cope with this element .

Yttrium Responsive Genes in Yeast FIGURE 5 | Functional enrichment analysis network of functions that when deleted render cells either sensitive ( blue nodes ) or resistant ( orange nodes ) to yttrium . Green lines represent gene overlap between two functions , with the edge width being proportional to the number of shared genes . The enrichment map was built using GSEA and visualized by the enrichment map plugin in Cytoscape . ( Figure 2 ) were related mainly to protein transport with the ubiquitin - dependent protein catabolic process via the MVB sorting pathway ( P = 1 . 88e − 10 ) but also to actin cytoskeleton organization ( P = 1 . 16e − 03 ) , and the sphingolipid biosynthetic process ( P = 9 . 60e − 05 ) ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . On a broader scale , other functions involved in yttrium toxicity were also observed in HR , MR , and LR mutants ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 3 ) . As observed for sensitive mutants , the transport GO term was highlighted ( P = 2 . 55e − 04 , 54 genes represented out of 815 ) . Hereafter , the major functions retrieved from the analysis of the resistant mutants are detailed . First , a group constituted predominantly by endocytosis , vesicle traﬃcking , and actin cytoskeleton organization , could be identiﬁed ( Figure 5 ) . Endocytosis is the process whereby cells recycle membranes or extracellular compounds as well as take up substances or downregulate plasma membrane transporters or receptors . Ten mutants out of 82 ( 12 . 1 % ) for genes involved in endocytosis ( P = 1 . 96e − 03 ) were resistant to yttrium ( (cid:49) Doa4 , (cid:49) Yck1 , (cid:49) Ent4 , (cid:49) Ent2 , (cid:49) Sla1 , (cid:49) Vrp1 , (cid:49) End3 , (cid:49) Siw14 , (cid:49) Mon2 , and (cid:49) Inp53 ) ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Second , the functional category “protein transport” was highlighted ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 3 ) . It included mostly functions involved in localization , transport , and catabolism of proteins ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Among the 51 mutants in this category , high representation of the ESCRT complex was apparent ( Figure 6 ) . Indeed , excluding (cid:49) Hse1 and (cid:49) Ist1 , mutants for all the sub - complexes , known as ESCRT - 0 ( Vps27p ) , ESCRT - I ( Srn2p , Stp22p , Mvb12p , and Vps28p ) , ESCRT - II ( Vps25p , Snf8p , and Vps36p ) , ESCRT - III ( Did4p , Snf7p , Vps24p , Vps20p , and Did2p ) , displayed a resistant phenotype ( Figure 6B and Supplementary Table 2 ) . Moreover , the mutants of the ESCRT - associated complex Vta1p - Vps4p and complex Bro1p - Doa4p shared the same phenotype ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . The ESCRT complex - dependent budding of small vesicles inside the lumen of late endosomes is responsible for the formation of the MVB ( Figure 6A ) . The subsequently formed MVB is targeted and fused to the vacuole where the internal vesicles are degraded . This pathway is mostly associated with ubiquitin - dependent protein catabolism . Consistently , two mutants for proteins involved in ubiquitination were resistant to yttrium ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . On the one hand , Doa4p is a ubiquitin hydrolase that is required for recycling ubiquitin and acts in the late endosome compartment to recover ubiquitin . On the other hand , Ubp2p is a ubiquitin - speciﬁc protease that is required for MVB sorting of membrane proteins .

It includes endocytosis ( 1 ) , targeting to ( and formation of ) the multivesicular body ( MVB ) compartment ( 2 ) , protein retrieval from the MVB to the late Golgi by the Retromer and GARP complex ( 3 ) , Golgi - to - vacuole trafﬁcking ( 4 ) , and MVB - to - vacuole fusion ( 5 ) pathways . Blue arrows denote the pathways in which the lack of a given protein render cells sensitive to yttrium , while orange arrows correspond to yttrium - resistant mutants . ( B ) Ten - fold dilution drop test assays of mutants for proteins involved in the different mentioned steps ( 1 – 5 ) . For the color code of the level of sensitivity or resistance , please refer to the legend of Figure 1 . The third group was composed of mutants with disrupted genes encoding enzymes involved in lipid metabolism ( Figure 5 ) . The sphingolipid metabolic process was the most signiﬁcant ( P = 4 . 46e − 05 ) . DPL1 , SUR2 , SCS7 , LCB3 , and ARV1 genes are part of the sphingolipid metabolic process , and the corresponding mutants display resistance toward yttrium ( Supplementary Tables 2 , 3 ) . Closely related functions were also represented , such as sphingolipid biosynthetic process ( TSC3 , ELO2 , LCB3 , Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 8 September 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2005 fmicb - 09 - 02005 August 31 , 2018 Time : 18 : 35 # 9 Grosjean et al . Yttrium Responsive Genes in Yeast ELO3 , and SUR1 ) , lipid biosynthetic process ( ELO2 , SUR2 , CAX4 , OAR1 , ERG3 , ELO3 , ERG2 , SCS7 , and ERG24 ) , and fatty acid biosynthetic process ( ELO2 , SUR2 , OAR1 , ERG3 , ELO3 , and SCS7 ) ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . All these mentioned mutants had impairments in enzymes involved in the modulation of sphingolipid levels , fatty acids synthesis , uptake , and elongation . A few yttrium - resistant mutants were involved in the transcriptional regulation of RNA polymerase III ( P = 9 . 74e − 03 ) ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . Mutants for CKB1 and CKA2 , encoding the catalytic sub - units of casein kinase 2 ( CK2 ) , were resistant . Pheromone - dependent signal transduction involved in the conjugation to cellular fusion ( STE50 , PTC1 , GET3 , MFA1 , FAR1 , STE18 , ARV1 , and STE4 ) ( P = 4 . 41e − 05 ) and the heterotrimeric G - protein complex cycle ( Ste18 and Ste4 ) ( P = 7 . 14e − 03 ) were also found ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . While these two latter proteins form a dimer that activates the mating signaling pathway , Ste50p acts as an adaptor that links a G protein - associated complex to the eﬀector Ste11p to modulate signal transduction . Get3p ampliﬁes G protein signaling and is also involved in ATP - dependent Golgi to ER traﬃcking . Mfa1p is the mating pheromone a - factor . Some mutants for proteins involved in the mitogen activated protein kinase signaling cascade ( MAPKs ) pathway were also resistant to yttrium , including (cid:49) Ste50 , (cid:49) Ste7 ( MAPKK ) , (cid:49) Ssk2 ( semi - redundant MAPKKK ) , and a mutant lacking the phosphotyrosine phosphatase Ptp2p that has a role in the inactivation of MAPK . Ptc1p is also a 2C - type protein phosphatase that indirectly inactivates the osmosensing MAPK cascade ( Chen and Thorner , 2007 ) . Finally , mutants for ribosomal sub - units also displayed a resistant phenotype . This category included mutants lacking the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit components Mrpl23p , Mrpl28p , and Mrpl49p , the large nuclear ribosomal subunit proteins Rpl8bp , Rpl21ap , Rpl37bp , and Rpl40ap , a protein from the small ribosomal subunit Rps12p and Rpp1ap , a component of the ribosomal stalk ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . DISCUSSION The screening of genome - wide collections of S . cerevisiae haploid mutants is a good strategy to uncover essential genes / proteins or functions allowing cells to cope with metal toxicity ( Haugen et al . , 2004 ; Kakimoto et al . , 2005 ; Thorsen et al . , 2006 , 2009 ; Pagani et al . , 2007 ; Wang et al . , 2007 ; Jin et al . , 2008 ; Jo et al . , 2008 ; Ruotolo et al . , 2008 ; Serero et al . , 2008 ; Arita et al . , 2009 ; Bleackley et al . , 2011 ; Chesi et al . , 2012 ; Tun et al . , 2014 ; Johnson et al . , 2016a , b ) . As a recognized eukaryotic model , S . cerevisiae is relevant to better understand the hazardous eﬀects of such contaminants on eukaryotic organisms since many genes are conserved among eukaryotic species . Identiﬁed sensitive mutants provide insights into tolerance mechanisms developed by cells , while resistant mutants may shed light on toxicity pathways ( e . g . , uptake or interacting molecules ) . In the present study , we adopted this genomic phenotyping approach under exposure to the technological critical element yttrium , an emerging contaminant ( United States Geological Survey , 2000 ; Wei et al . , 2001 ; Mayﬁeld and Lewis , 2013 ; Ciacci et al . , 2015 ) . Strikingly , relatively few mutants ( 56 ) showed sensitivity to yttrium . Nonetheless , this number is not abnormal in comparison to other screenings ( Kakimoto et al . , 2005 ; Wang et al . , 2007 ; Jin et al . , 2008 ; Tun et al . , 2014 ; Du et al . , 2015 ; Johnson et al . , 2016a ) . The relatively low number of sensitive mutants identiﬁed may reﬂect the restricted number of functions available for yeast cells to cope with yttrium toxicity . In contrast , the high number of resistant mutants is indicative of a wide range of yttrium - induced toxicity mechanisms . Furthermore , comparison of the present mutant set with available studies on other metals outlined the functions and key genes / proteins involved speciﬁcally or not in the response of yeast to yttrium stress . These major functions are discussed below . Mutants for vacuolar membrane ATPase ( VMA ) family genes were sensitive to yttrium . The VMA allows pH homeostasis by acidiﬁcation of the vacuolar lumen and thus creates a proton gradient across the tonoplast . As illustrated hereafter , the present set of VMA mutants lacked proteins involved in diﬀerent steps ranging from assembly , translocation , to the functioning of the VMA . Vma21p and Vma22p are localized to the ER periphery and are involved in VMA assembly before its translocation , ﬁrst to the Golgi and ﬁnally to the vacuolar membrane ( Graham et al . , 1998 ) . Vma16p encodes the third proteolipid subunit of the VMA ( Hirata et al . , 1997 ) . It is ﬁrst located on the ER membrane before being pulled together with the other subunits of the VMA complex ( Graham et al . , 1998 ) . Vma7p , one of the eight subunits of the V1 peripheral membrane domain of VMA , participates in the structure and activity of the whole complex ( Graham et al . , 1994 ; Forgac , 1999 ) . It has been hypothesized that vacuolar membrane vesicles and the VMA - built proton gradient can contribute to the vacuolar uptake of nickel in S . cerevisiae ( Nishimura et al . , 1998 ) . Indeed , the lack of the VMA and its associated proton gradient led to a defect in vacuolar sequestration of nickel and an increased cell sensitivity to this metal ( Nishimura et al . , 1998 ) . Similar ﬁndings have been obtained from most of the other metals tested by genomic phenotyping ( Jin et al . , 2008 ; Ruotolo et al . , 2008 ; Bleackley et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , a study based on the functional characterization of VMA has also reported that acidiﬁcation of the vacuole ensures an important role in ionic ( e . g . , calcium , manganese , zinc , and copper ) homeostasis and detoxiﬁcation ( Ramsay and Gadd , 1997 ) . Thus , VMA activity is likely to act as a general modulation of cellular toxicity induced by metals , including the newly studied element yttrium . Thirteen mutants for ribosomal proteins , representing 9 . 5 % of the 137 total ribosomal genes of S . cerevisiae , were also obtained from the screening , displaying either a sensitive or resistant phenotype toward yttrium exposure . This versatile response of ribosomal proteins has also been previously shown under chromium exposure ( Johnson et al . , 2016b ) . The resistant phenotype of the mutated cells could be explained by a strategy of slowing down cell growth through decreased protein synthesis . Hence , cells would mainly shift their metabolism toward toxicity Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 9 September 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2005 fmicb - 09 - 02005 August 31 , 2018 Time : 18 : 35 # 10 Grosjean et al . Yttrium Responsive Genes in Yeast scavenging and cellular components repair . This hypothesis has recently been reinforced by Pan et al . ( 2017 ) , who recorded a down - regulation of ribosomal gene expression under cadmium stress , concluding that the cellular resources could be diverted to the metal stress response rather than being consumed for the synthesis of ribosomes . Conversely , the explanation for the sensitive phenotype displayed by some ribosome - related mutants is not as straightforward . It has been further argued that chromium might impact protein translation ( Johnson et al . , 2016b ) . Altogether , this ﬁnding and the present data indicate that some of these ribosomal proteins would be essential for cells to cope with chromium and yttrium stress . In addition to the impact of yttrium toxicity at the translational level , this study highlighted the putative role of several signaling pathways for modulation of the yttrium response . First , two mutants , (cid:49) Ckb1 and (cid:49) Cka2 , showed a resistance phenotype to yttrium . CK2 is a Ser / Thr protein kinase that has many substrates , including transcription factors and all RNA polymerases . Our results suggest that this enzyme might regulate yttrium toxicity signaling . The (cid:49) Ckb1 mutant was also resistant to Cr ( III ) and was associated with a reduced accumulation compared with wild - type [ 16 % less Cr ( III ) after 16 h ] , while the (cid:49) Cka2 mutant accumulated more Cr ( III ) ( Johnson et al . , 2016b ) . The involvement of CK2 in the response to aluminum , chromium , and arsenic toxicity underlines its key role in metal toxicity mitigation via the signaling pathway , possibly by regulating cell entry of toxic metals ( Johnson et al . , 2016a , b ) , including yttrium . Another aspect of signaling arose , since several genes involved in the pheromone - dependent signal transduction as well as in the MAPK signaling cascade conferred , when mutated , an yttrium - resistant phenotype to cells . Activation of the MAPK signaling cascade in response to diﬀerent signals or stresses , such as exposure to metals , is well known in S . cerevisiae ( Chen and Thorner , 2007 ) . Surprisingly , discrepancies were observed for these pathways when comparing yttrium exposure to zinc , arsenic , and cadmium stresses . Indeed , these mutants , except (cid:49) Bck1 , were resistant to yttrium but sensitive to the other metals ( Jin et al . , 2008 ) . Among the MAPK signal transduction pathways , the pheromone response pathway was represented along with the Ste4p and Ste18p components of the heterotrimeric G - protein complex , which is associated with pheromone receptors ( Chen and Thorner , 2007 ) . It is well established that pheromone stimulation leads to cell cycle arrest . Moreover , it has been suggested that this pathway facilitates cell wall alterations required for the mating process ( Chen and Thorner , 2007 ) and thus leads to a more susceptible cell wall . Therefore , the resistance phenotype of mutants disrupted in the pheromone - dependent signal transduction pathway could be explained by the lack of cell cycle arrest or by the reduction of cell wall alterations , allowing cells to cope with yttrium toxicity . Comparison of the dataset of yttrium - sensitive and - resistant mutants with those from other genomic phenotyping screenings on gamma - rays , alkaline pH , or oxidative stress induced by a set of chemicals ( Bennett et al . , 2001 ; Chang et al . , 2002 ; Aouida et al . , 2004 ; Serrano et al . , 2004 ; Thorpe et al . , 2004 ) , displayed limited similarities . These results do not support the hypothesis of the involvement of oxidative stress , DNA - damage or of an alkaline - pH - related response in yttrium toxicity . This hypothesis is reinforced by the observation that neither mitochondrial nor nuclear compartments were signiﬁcantly impaired by yttrium ( Table 1 ) . The disruption of genes related to protein transport and vesicular traﬃcking modiﬁed the cell response to yttrium . Notably , the whole cascade starting from membrane endocytosis to the trans - Golgi and vacuole , through endosomes and the MVB , was represented among the mutants impaired by yttrium . Interestingly , protein transport as well as recycling or catabolism via the ubiquitin - dependent catabolic process was central to the yeast response to yttrium . This phenomenon has only been previously evidenced for nickel and methyl - mercury , since the deletion of MVB sorting pathway - related proteins ( ESCRT complex ) rendered yeast highly resistant to these stressors ( Ruotolo et al . , 2008 ; Arita et al . , 2009 ; Hwang et al . , 2014 ) . Our results suggest a similar conclusion for yttrium since mutants from the same pathway were also resistant to yttrium . Conversely , mutants for three components of the retrograde pathway , namely , Vps54p , Vps52p , and Vps51p , were all sensitive to yttrium , cadmium ( Ruotolo et al . , 2008 ) , arsenic ( Thorsen et al . , 2009 ; Johnson et al . , 2016b ) , and chromium ( Johnson et al . , 2016b ) , but not to nickel ( Ruotolo et al . , 2008 ) . However , no straightforward explanation could be drawn . Nevertheless , the contrasting phenotypes for mutants of the ESCRT - complex vs . the retrograde pathway particularly suggest that the MVB could be a central target for yttrium toxicity modulation . The actin cytoskeleton along with endocytosis appears to be also of high importance in yttrium homeostasis . Indeed , sub - functions related to these two categories are highly represented among yttrium - resistant mutants . The cytoskeleton and endocytosis are closely related as the latter is governed by actin ( Robertson et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , mutants for the majority of genes involved in the connection between the cytoskeleton and endocytosis were yttrium - resistant , such as (cid:49) Vrp1 , (cid:49) End3 , (cid:49) Sla1 , (cid:49) Ent2 , and (cid:49) Ent4 . Both Vrp1p ( verprolin ) and End3p promote actin nucleation and cytoskeleton organization and endocytosis ( Benedetti et al . , 1994 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ) . Sla1p plays a crucial role in the cortical actin patch structure and organization . It interacts with End3p and links the actin cytoskeleton and the endocytosis machinery ( Warren et al . , 2002 ) . Finally , both Ent2p and Ent4p , mammalian epsin - like proteins , possess an Epsin N - terminal homology domain that is usually found in proteins implicated in endocytosis regulation or cytoskeleton organization . It is noteworthy that endocytosis has only been previously mentioned as taking part in chromate homeostasis ( Holland and Avery , 2009 ) . Chromate accumulation and cell sensitivity were higher in endocytosis - defective mutants than in wild - type . Moreover , it has been demonstrated that chromate stress increases endocytosis in S . cerevisiae . Taken together , these data emphasize that actin - related endocytosis functions as a compulsory mechanism for chromate resistance , possibly through endocytic inactivation of Cr - transporting proteins . However , endocytosis mutants were yttrium - resistant , suggesting the presence of diﬀerent homeostasis mechanisms between yttrium and chromate . Frontiers in Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 10 September 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2005 fmicb - 09 - 02005 August 31 , 2018 Time : 18 : 35 # 11 Grosjean et al . Yttrium Responsive Genes in Yeast The toxicity of a metal might begin with the prerequisite step of its entry into cells . Thus , decreased or suppressed uptake of yttrium should lead to cellular resistance toward this element . Two hypotheses can be drawn to explain this resistance phenotype : ( i ) The improper recycling of a yet unidentiﬁed eﬄux system for yttrium would drive its accumulation at the plasma membrane . Consequently , yttrium detoxiﬁcation in the cytosol would be enhanced through increased eﬄux of this element out of the cell . Endocytosis of metal transporters has been shown in diﬀerent organisms to modulate the uptake of speciﬁc metals , rationalizing this hypothesis . For instance , the yeast membrane metal transporters Zrt1p and Ctr1p are post - translationally regulated by ubiquitination and endocytosis to be degraded in the vacuole ( Ooi et al . , 1996 ; Gitan and Eide , 2000 ; Liu et al . , 2007 ) . In agreement with this hypothesis , defects in these two proteins ( Doa4p and Ubp2p ) involved in ubiquitination induced resistance to yttrium . ( ii ) Alternatively , endocytic vesicles containing yttrium ( either membrane - bound or in the vesicle lumen ) could be involved in the non - speciﬁc uptake of yttrium . According to these two hypotheses , mutations in either of these two transport systems would result in a high intracellular content of yttrium . However , putative non - speciﬁc plasma membrane transporters mediating yttrium uptake cannot be ruled out , as suggested for nickel ( Ruotolo et al . , 2008 ) . To test these hypotheses , further proteomic and ionomic ( yttrium quantiﬁcation ) studies are needed . The lipid biosynthetic process was identiﬁed in the present screening by fatty acid , ergosterol , and sphingolipid synthesis mutants that displayed yttrium resistance . Hence , the biosynthesis of these molecules appears to trigger yttrium toxicity , excluding in two mutants , (cid:49) Csg2 and (cid:49) Sur1 , which were highly sensitive to yttrium as well as to calcium ( Beeler et al . , 1994 , 1997 ) . In the latter case , a calcium - induced plasma membrane alteration would lead to sensitivity of these mutants . The complex formed by the MIPC synthase catalytic sub - unit Sur1p and the regulatory sub - unit Csg2p acts as an inositol phosphorylceramide mannosyltransferase complex ( Beeler et al . , 1997 ) . Additionally , (cid:49) Csg2 and (cid:49) Sur1 also accumulate fewer mannosylated sphingolipids along with an increase in lysophosphatidylinositol compared with the wild - type strain ( Beeler et al . , 1997 ) . The calcium sensitivity of these mutants would result from the accumulation and / or mislocalization of IPC ( inositol - P - ceramide ) rather than a depletion of MIPC content . MIPC has been shown to be required for the proper localization of proteins to the plasma - membrane in Schizosaccharomyces pombe ( Nakase et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , some other studies have proposed that this lipid might be involved in determining the activity of the plasma membrane drug transporters and / or the permeability properties of this membrane ( Lisman et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , an imbalance in plasma membrane sphingolipid composition could be responsible for the yttrium - sensitive phenotype displayed by these mutants . Moreover , several mutants mentioned earlier lack enzymes that participate either in fatty acid biosynthesis , uptake , or elongation and subsequently impact cellular sphingolipid levels . Sphingolipids are implicated in numerous pathways from temperature tolerance to the cell cycle , actin metabolism , and protein stability and localization ( Montefusco et al . , 2014 ) . It has been demonstrated that several classes of lipids participate in endocytosis , and more particularly , in the clathrin - independent endocytic pathway ( Kirkham and Parton , 2005 ) . As demonstrated in Chinese hamster ovary cells , diﬀerent endocytic pathways are altered by the depletion of either general sphingolipids or , more speciﬁcally , glycosphingolipids ( Cheng et al . , 2006 ) . Taken together , these data emphasize the role of the plasma membrane as a hotspot for yttrium toxicity . CONCLUSION The present study reports the ﬁrst cellular and molecular insights addressing yttrium toxicity and thus shedding light on the previously unknown impact of yttrium on eukaryotes . Both cellular toxicity and detoxiﬁcation mechanisms revealed in S . cerevisiae provide valuable information for further potential environmental issues derived from this emerging metallic contaminant . The cellular response to yttrium appeared to exhibit peculiarities in comparison to other metals . Signaling pathways , protein translation , and the vacuolar compartment are well known for their involvement in metal toxicity modulation , while unexpected pathways such as endocytosis and sphingolipid metabolism revealed new perspectives in our understanding of metal homeostasis in eukaryotes . Based on the present ﬁndings , further investigations must be conducted in other eukaryotes , including human cells . Such studies have been performed using nickel and demonstrated a high degree of conservation of various aspects of metal toxicity between S . cerevisiae and mammals ( Lee et al . , 1995 ; Broday et al . , 1999 ; Sutherland et al . , 2001 ; Costa et al . , 2005 ) . This information will aid in deciphering whether the identiﬁed mechanisms of yttrium toxicity can be extended to all eukaryotes .
