Here we demonstrate transport of horseradish peroxidase - labeled cholera toxin to the ER by electron microscopy in thapsigargin - treated A431 cells . Thap - sigargin treatment strongly increased cholera toxin - induced cAMP production , and the formation ofthe catalytically active A1 fragment was somewhat increased . Binding ofcholera toxin to the cell surface and transport of toxin to the Golgi apparatus were not changed in thapsigargin - treated cells , suggesting increased retrograde transport of cholera toxin from the Golgi apparatus to the ER . The data demonstrate that retrograde transport of cholera toxin can take place and that the transport is under regulation . The results are con - sistent with the idea that retrograde transport can be impor - tant for the action of cholera toxin . Cholera toxin is an enterotoxin released by Vibrio cholerae ( for review see refs . 1 and 2 ) . The enzymatically active A subunit enters the cytosol and ADP ribosylates the a subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins , thereby activating adenylyl cyclase . The A fragment is noncovalently bound to five small B subunits that bind to GM1 at the cell surface . The A fragment is cleaved near the C - terminal end , but the two fragments , the A1 subunit with the enzymatic activity and the small A2 subunit which has a KDEL sequence , are associated by a disulfide bond . Both cleavage and reduction are required for activation of the ADP ribosylation activity . The toxin has to be endocy - tosed before translocation of the A1 subunit to the cytosol ( 1 , 3 - 7 ) , and cholera toxin - horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) can be transported to the Golgi complex ( 8 ) . Brefeldin A ( BFA ) , which disrupts Golgi structure and function ( 9 - 11 ) , protects against cholera toxin and inhibits the release of the A1 fragment ( 4 , 5 , 12 ) , suggesting involvement of the Golgi apparatus . Since KDEL - receptors , responsible for bringing proteins with this sequence in a retrograde manner to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( 13 ) , are distributed throughout the Golgi apparatus ( 14 , 15 ) , they could be involved in retrograde transport of the toxin to the ER ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 16 , 17 ) . The recently published crystal structure of cholera toxin ( 18 ) reveals that the A2 chain , although going through the hole in the doughnut structure formed by the B subunits , appears on the side facing the receptor with the KDEL sequence exposed . In fact , mutations in the KDEL sequence of cholera toxin and the RDEL sequence of the related toxin LT1 delayed the toxin action in polarized T84 cells ( 6 ) . Also Cieplak et al . ( 16 ) who mutated the RDEL sequence in LT1 , found that the toxin could still raise the level of cAMP . Thus , it is clear that although the K ( R ) DEL sequence may play a role in the intoxication process , it is not absolutely required for toxin action . However , these results do not imply that the toxin is not transported in a retrograde manner . Cholera toxin B subunit , which does not have a KDEL signal , can be transported to the various Golgi cisterns in A431 cells ( 19 ) . Also , Shiga toxin , which does not contain a KDEL sequence , can be transported through the Golgi cisterns and to the ER ( 19 - 22 ) . However , in some cell types , the cells had to be sensitized to Shiga toxin before a visualization was possible ( 19 , 20 ) . In this study we have investigated whether A431 cells could be sensitized to cholera toxin , and whether we could then observe retrograde transport of a cholera toxin - HRP conjugate . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials . Cholera toxin , cholera toxin B subunit , Hepes , fumonisin B1 , cycloheximide , diaminobenzidine , and N - succinimidyl 3 - [ 2 - pyridyldithio ] propionate were purchased from Sigma . Na1251 was obtained from DuPont , [ 35S ] methi - onine ( 1000 Ci / mmol ; 1 Ci = 37 GBq ) was from Amersham , and [ 3H ] leucine was obtained from New England Nuclear . BFA was purchased from Epicentre Technologies ( Madison , WI ) . Cholera toxin was labeled with 1251 according to Fraker and Speck ( 23 ) . The conjugate between cholera toxin and HRP was prepared as described previously for ricin ( 24 ) . Pseudo - monas exotoxin A was obtained from the Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute , Berne . Cell Culture . A431 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection , Rockville , MD , and the cells were grown in DMEM ( Flow Laboratories ) as described previously ( 19 ) . The medium contained 10 % fetal calf serum ( GIBCO ) and 2 mM glutamine . Measurement of cAMP . The content of cAMP in the cells was measured by a cyclic [ 3H ] AMP assay system from Amer - sham as described ( 19 ) . Measurement ofProtein Synthesis . The cells were incubated in a leucine - free Hepes - containing medium with 1 , uCi of [ 3H ] leucine per ml for 15 min at 37°C and then processed as described ( 19 ) . Processing for Electron Microscopy . A431 cells grown in T - 25 flasks were at the end of experiment fixed with 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M Na - cacodylate buffer , pH 7 . 2 , for 60 min at room temperature . The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with diaminobenzidine and H202 as de - scribed earlier ( 25 ) . The cells were then postfixed , embedded in Epon , cut at 50 nm , and examined in a JEOL 100 CX microscope as previously described ( 25 ) . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Transport of proteins from the ER and into the Golgi appa - ratus is clearly dependent on the conditions in the ER , both Ca2 + and the oxidizing conditions of the ER are important for correct folding and transport out of the ER ( 26 - 29 ) .

USA 93 ( 1996 ) transport may even be under regulation ( 30 ) . Similarly , trans - port from the Golgi apparatus to the ER seems to be regulated ( 19 , 20 ) . We therefore tested whether the drug thapsigargin , which leads to a discharge of ER calcium stores by inhibiting transport of Ca2 + into the ER cistern ( 31 ) , might affect the response to cholera toxin . As shown in Fig . LA , thapsigargin clearly increased the response to cholera toxin . After 1 h with toxin , the level of cAMP was ' 6X higher in the thapsigargin - treated cells than in the control cells ( Fig . 1A ) . As shown ( Fig . 1B ) , the stimulation is maximal at 20 - 40 ng / ml thapsigargin , and about the same whether it is measured after 1 , 24 , or 48 h preincubation with thapsigargin ( Fig . 1C ) . There may be a slightly better response after 48 h . Also after 48 h incubation the effect of 20 and 40 ng / ml thapsigargin is similar , and the response is equally large with 0 . 1 and 1 , g / ml cholera toxin ( Fig . 1D ) . The low concentrations of thapsigargin here used A a a . C ) 2 0 0 E Q seem to have a specific effect on the ER Ca2 + - ATPase , whereas higher concentrations may have additional effects ( 32 ) . The possibility existed that there was a slower hydrolysis of cAMP in thapsigargin - treated cells . However , even when isobutylmethylxanthine , an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase , was present to prevent hydrolysis of cAMP , the results were similar ( data not shown ) . Altogether the data suggest that thapsigargin increases the cholera toxin induced production of cAMP in the cells . We next investigated whether we could see labeling of the ER with a cholera - HRP conjugate in control A431 cells and in thapsigargin - sensitized cells . As shown in Fig . 2 , transport to some ER cisterns could indeed be demonstrated in the sen - sitized cells whereas the conjugate was never observed in the ER of control cells ( not shown ) .

A431 cells were incubated for 48 h with thapsigargin ( 20 ng / ml ) and then for 2 h with a cholera toxin - HRP conjugate . Then the cells were washed , fixed , and processed for electron microscopy as described in Materials and Methods . A shows cholera - HRP ( arrows ) in some cisterns of the ER ; B similarly shows cholera - HRP in the ER ( arrow ) as well as in the Golgi complex ( Go ) . Note that in bothA and B most of the ER cisterns appear unlabeled and also that even within a single ER cistern ( arrows ) the amount of cholera - HRP seems to vary from one end to the other . Without thapsigargin , however , such labeling of the ER was never observed . ( Bar = 0 . 25 , um ) . treated cells . This was indeed the case ( Fig . 3 ) , suggesting involvement of the Golgi apparatus . Experiments with 125 [ _ labeled toxin and subcellular fractionation showed that thap - sigargin did not change the binding of toxin to the cells or the transport to the Golgi apparatus ( not shown ) , suggesting that thapsigargin increased retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus and to the ER . In brain cells it has been reported that Ca2 + appears to enhance the rate of cholera toxin induced adenylate cyclase activation by a mechanism that is calmodu - lin - dependent ( 33 ) . However , as shown in Fig . 4 , neither the Ca - antagonists 8 - ( diethylamino ) octyl - 3 , 4 , 5 - trimethoxybenzo - ate ( TMB - 8 ) ( 34 ) and 1 , 2 - bis ( o - aminophenoxy ) ethane - N , N , N ' , N ' - tetraacetate tetraacetoxymethyl ester ( BAPTA - AM ) ( 35 ) nor the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine re - duced the effect of cholera toxin in the presence of thapsigargin . Actually , both TMB - 8 and BAPTA - AM rather gave a further increase in the level of cAMP when added together with thapsigargin and cholera toxin . Thus , there is no evidence that an increased concentration of Ca2 + in the cytosol is required for the observed effects . It is not clear where in the cell reduction of the disulfide bond between Al and A2 can take place . The disulfide isomerases located in the ER ( 36 ) might mediate reduction , or it could take place after toxin translocation to the cytosol . After submission of this manuscript it was reported that upon addition of GM1 to Vero cells reduction of the A fragment of cholera toxin could be demonstrated in the ER ( 37 ) . However , whether the added GM1 could mediate translocation of chol - era toxin to the cytosol and thereby increase the response to the toxin was not investigated . If the added GM1 is not incorporated into the membrane it might not behave as the natural receptor . Evidence for reduction of the A subunit in endosomal / Golgi fractions has also been presented ( 7 ) . Since there is an increased level of cAMP in thapsigargin - treated cells , we investigated whether this was accompanied by an increased formation of Al . Cells were incubated with and without thapsigargin and 125I - labeled cholera toxin ( incubation times as in Fig . 1 ) , N - ethylmaleimide was added to block further reduction , the cells were lysed , and protein was ana - lyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis and densitometry of the corresponding autoradiograms . The data revealed that thap - sigargin increased release of A1 by a factor of 1 . 5 ( SD = 1 . 51 ± 0 . 29 , n = 9 ) , a factor much smaller than the effect on cAMP ( 6 times ) . However , the total amount of reduced toxin may not reflect toxin that can be translocated to the cytosol . One can only speculate on the mechanism behind the thapsigargin - induced increase of cholera toxin in the ER . It has been reported that thapsigargin inhibits transport out of the ER of some , but not all , secretory and membrane proteins ( 27 , 29 , 38 , 39 ) . Examples of proteins which are not transported out of the ER in the presence of thapsigargin are the Sendai virus protein HN ( 38 ) , a , antitrypsin ( 39 ) , and the asialoglycopro - 54 . & Proc .

BFA inhibits the ability of cholera toxin to raise the concen - tration of cAMP in thapsigargin - treated A431 cells . Cells were incubated with and without thapsigargin ( 20 ng / ml ) for 1 h at 37°C . Then some of the cells were incubated with BFA ( 2 , ug / ml ) for 10 min before cholera toxin ( 0 . 1 , tg / ml ) was added as indicated . After another hour of incu - bation the concentration of cAMP was measured . The bars indicate SD between duplicates . tein receptor ( 29 ) . Also , transport can be blocked at a later step ( 38 ) . The Sendai virus protein Fo is apparently able to reach C . 2 4 EI 0 . A a 0 . E Q . B the trans - Golgi network and become sialylated even in the presence of thapsigargin , but the protein is then degraded instead of being exported to the cell surface . The results suggested that even incorrectly folded proteins can be trans - ported out of the ER , but that the transport is arrested at a later stage . On the other hand , secretion of the nonglycosylated protein albumin is not affected ( 39 ) , and secretion of surface IgM , which is glycosylated , can in some cells be increased by thapsigargin ( 27 ) . In A431 cells the thapsigargin concentra - tions here used only slightly reduced the total secretion of soluble proteins pulse - labeled with [ 35S ] methionine . The se - cretion was measured as release of radioactively labeled tri - chloracetic acid - precipitable material ( data not shown ) . How - ever , the same drug concentrations clearly reduced the cell growth ( data not shown ) . Although it is clear that thapsigargin can affect protein transport , its effect on ( glyco ) lipid transport is not known . It has been reported that BFA - induced retro - grade transport of Golgi cisterns to the ER is inhibited by thapsigargin ( 40 ) , but quite high thapsigargin concentrations were used ( 500 nM ) , and it is also not clear whether normal retrograde transport is similar to the BFA - induced transport . It is possible that inhibition of export of certain proteins can slow down ( glyco ) lipid transport as well , and if anterograde transport is changed , this might increase the probability for retrograde transport of certain molecules . For instance , if there are more empty KDEL receptors in the various Golgi cisterns , the possibility exists that this could lead to increased retrograde transport of a KDEL - containing toxin like cholera toxin to the ER . It is also possible that thapsigargin might inhibit a possible recycling of cholera toxin out of the ER and thereby increase the net transport of toxin to this location . Thapsigargin treatment of cells leads to an accumulation of the stress proteins GRP78 and GRP94 , an accumulation that is dependent on protein synthesis and on one or more phosphor - ylation events ( 41 ) . However , protein synthesis is not required for the thapsigargin - induced increase of the cholera toxin effect , and even inhibition of glycolipid synthesis by addition of fumonisin B1 did not abolish the thapsigargin - induced effect C 180 165 150 135 ° 120 4 105 °E 90 90 75 60 45 30 15 xx 40 40 FIG . 4 . The Ca2 + - antagonists TMB - 8 ( A ) and BAPTA - AM ( B ) and the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine ( C ) do not reduce the level of cAMP in cells treated with thapsigargin ( 20 ng / ml ) and cholera toxin ( 0 . 1 , Lg / ml ) . In those cases where thapsigargin was added , cholera toxin was added 1 h later , and the incubation was continued for 1 h more before the level of cAMP was measured as described in Materials and Methods . In A , TMB - 8 ( 50 AM ) was added 30 min before any of the other components . In B , BAPTA - AM ( 25 , uM ) was similarly added 45 min before thapsigargin , and in C , trifluoperazine ( 30 , uM ) was added 15 min before thapsigargin . 12342 Cell Biology : Sandvig et al . 0 - x - I - # ' IV , 51 - 0 x Al x Iq x % 4 . 4 Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 93 ( 1996 ) 12343 ( data not shown ) . Whether a change in phosphorylation might be important is still an open question . The possibility existed that the effect of other protein toxins might be enhanced as well . However , thapsigargin did not increase the effect of either Pseudomonas exotoxin A , which has a KDEL - like sequence ( 42 ) , or of ricin which do not have such a sequence ( 43 ) . Since it is believed that both these toxins require retrograde transport to intoxicate cells ( 17 , 44 - 46 ) , the data suggest that thapsigargin does not in general increase retrograde transport . The results here shown demonstrate retrograde transport of cholera toxin to the ER , and they demonstrate that retrograde transport of cholera toxin is under regulation . Furthermore , they are in agreement with the idea that retrograde transport of cholera toxin could be important for toxin translocation to the cytosol and for the ability of cholera toxin to increase the level of cAMP .
