The Ndc80 complex is evolutionarily conserved and contains the four subunits Spc24 , Spc25 , Nuf2 , and Ndc80 ( whose human homologue is called Hec1 ) . All four subunits are predicted to contain globular domains and extensive coiled coil regions . To gain an insight into the organiza - tion of the human Ndc80 complex , we reconstituted it using recombinant methods . The hydrodynamic proper - ties of the recombinant Ndc80 complex are identical to those of the endogenous HeLa cell complex and are con - sistent with a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 stoichiometry of the four subunits and a very elongated shape . Two tight Hec1 - Nuf2 and Spc24 - Spc25 subcomplexes , each stabilized by a parallel heterodimeric coiled coil , maintain this organization . These subcomplexes tetramerize via an interaction of the C - and N - terminal portions of the Hec1 - Nuf2 and Spc24 - Spc25 coiled coils , respectively . The recombinant complex displays normal kinetochore localization upon injection in HeLa cells and is therefore a faithful copy of the endogenous Ndc80 complex . Kinetochores mediate the attachment of chromosomes to mi - crotubules of the mitotic spindle ( 1 , 2 ) . The kinetochores of Sac - charomyces cerevisiae assemble on (cid:1) 150 - base pair - long centro - meric DNA wrapped around a specialized nucleosome containing Cse4 , a histone H3 variant known as CENP - A in higher eu - karyotes ( 3 ) . These kinetochores become attached to the plus end of a single microtubule and are estimated to contain at least 60 different proteins in several subcomplexes ( 3 ) . Together , these subcomplexes produce stable DNA - microtubule bridges and con - trol the spindle assembly checkpoint . The latter delays anaphase sister chromatid separation until all chromosomes have achieved bio - orientation by their sister kinetochores becoming attached to microtubules from opposite poles ( 4 ) . Human centromeres extend over millions of base pairs , and the compaction of centromeric chromatin is essential for their viability ( 1 , 2 ) . Recent proteomic efforts in different organisms have clarified that despite significant differences in centromere complexity , most kinetochore proteins are conserved from yeast to humans ( 5 – 12 ) . Thus , complex kinetochores might be assem - bled from building blocks that are structurally related to that of S . cerevisiae . By electron microscopy the vertebrate kineto - chore appears as a multilayered structure with an inner core embedded in the centromeric chromatin and connected by a 40 - nm fibrous gap to a 40 - nm thick outer plate . A 150 - Å - thick dynamic structure known as the fibrous corona extends out - ward from the outer plate ( 13 – 18 ) . Vertebrate kinetochores bind multiple microtubules ( from 15 to 30 ) whose plus ends terminate within the outer plate ( 1 , 13 ) . The dynamic properties of microtubule - kinetochore inter - faces are thought to be responsible for chromosome movement in mitosis ( 19 , 20 ) . Although the mechanisms leading to the formation of microtubule - kinetochore interfaces remain poorly understood , the Ndc80 protein has emerged as a potentially critical player in this process . In budding yeast Ndc80 is part of the Ndc80 complex , which also contains Nuf2 , Spc24 , and Spc25 ( 10 , 21 , 22 ) . This quaternary organization is conserved in the Xenopus and human complexes ( 23 – 25 ) . The human homo - logue of Ndc80 is referred to as Hec1 , which stands for highly enhanced in cancer cells 1 ( 26 ) , and we will refer to Hec1 as a subunit of the human Ndc80 complex . Antibodies to Hec1 lo - calize to the outer plate of HeLa cell kinetochores where the plus ends of kinetochore microtubules are anchored ( 27 – 30 ) . Depletion or inactivation of subunits of the Ndc80 complex by several methods invariably results in severe problems of chro - mosome congression and lack of poleward forces at the kineto - chore ( reviewed in Refs . 19 and 20 ) . There has been some controversy as to whether the defective chromosome congression phenotype resulting from depletion of Ndc80 is caused by a defect in kinetochore - microtubule attach - ment . Depletion of Hec1 or Spc25 by RNA interference in HeLa cells resulted in a failure of chromosomes to congress to the spindle equator , but the existence of kinetochore - microtubule connections that resisted short cold or calcium treatments and the localization of the microtubule plus end - binding protein EB1 at the kinetochore - microtubule interface suggested that stable kinetochore - microtubule interactions may form in these cells ( 23 , 31 ) . Recent studies , however , concluded that cells depleted of * This work was supported by grants from the Italian Association for Cancer Research ( AIRC ) , the Italian Ministry of Health , and the Hu - man Frontier Science Program .

Thus , the Ndc80 complex might be essential for the formation of stable kinetochore - microtubule interactions , suggestive of a direct role in micro - tubule binding or , alternatively , a role in a kinetochore assem - bly pathway , the impairment of which abrogates recruitment of other proteins required for microtubule binding . Indeed , the depletion / inactivation of the Ndc80 complex causes a corre - sponding kinetochore depletion or reduction of a group of pro - teins normally localized at or in the corona peripheral to the kinetochore outer plate , including the motor proteins dynein / dynactin and the spindle assembly checkpoint proteins Mps1 , Mad1 , Mad2 , Zw10 , and Rod . However , peripheral checkpoint proteins and motor proteins such as Bub1 , BubR1 , and CENP - E retain an essentially normal kinetochore localization under these conditions ( 23 – 25 , 28 – 33 ) . In summary , the Ndc80 complex plays a direct role in stabilizing the kinetochore - mi - crotubule interface and in controlling the localization of a sub - set of proteins at or in the corona peripheral to the kinetochore outer plate , although its precise function in these processes remains unclear . The complexity of the putative microtubule - kinetochore interface is underscored by the recent discovery that the Ndc80 complex is part of an evolutionarily conserved protein assembly also containing the Mtw1 - Mis12 complex and other proteins such as Zwint - 1 and Spc105 ( 7 – 11 ) . The role of the Ndc80 complex as a direct or indirect kinetochore receptor for Mps1 , Mad1 , Mad2 , Zw10 , and Rod might also explain the effects of Ndc80 depletion on the spindle assembly checkpoint . These effects range from complete inactivation to sustained activation followed by cell death , with a discrepancy that might be explained by the penetrance of the depletion phenotype ( 23 – 25 , 28 – 35 ) . Because of the complexity of kinetochore structure , the devel - opment of in vitro approaches using reconstituted kinetochore complexes will be invaluable to elucidate the mechanism of for - mation of kinetochore - microtubule interfaces . Here , we describe a step in this direction represented by the reconstitution and characterization of the human Ndc80 complex . We show that the reconstituted complex forms a quaternary assembly whose bio - physical , biochemical , and biological properties are indistin - guishable from those of the endogenous complex . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning , Expression , and Purification of Hec1 Complex Constructs— All constructs for human Spc24 , Spc25 , Nuf2 , and Hec1 subunits were generated by PCR using a human fetal thymus cDNA library ( Invitro - gen ) . Spc24 , Spc25 , Nuf2 , and Hec1 sequences were subcloned in a modified pGEX - 6P vector ( pGEX - 6P - 2RBS ) to support dicistronic ex - pression . All constructs were sequenced . Protein expression in Esche - richia coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) was induced with 400 (cid:1) M isopropyl - (cid:2) - D - thiogalactopyranoside . Expression was continued for (cid:1) 12 – 16 h at 18 – 20 °C . Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 , 000 rpm for 15 min in a Beckman JLA 10 . 5 rotor and resuspended in 30 – 40 ml of lysis buffer ( 50 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 600 m M NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1 m M EDTA , and 1 m M dithiothreitol supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Molecular Biochemicals ) per liter of E . coli culture . After sonication , the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 40 , 000 rpm for 45 – 60 min using a 55 . 1 Ti rotor . Glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) 1 - Spc24 - Spc25 and GST - Nuf2 - Hec1 were purified using glutathi - one - agarose beads ( Amersham Biosciences ) . After 2 – 3 h of agitation at 4 °C , beads were washed with 30 volumes of lysis buffer and equili - brated with 30 volumes of cleavage buffer ( 50 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 150 m M NaCl , 1 m M EDTA , and 1 m M dithiothreitol ) . The Spc24 - Spc25 subcomplex was cleaved from GST with 10 units of PreScission protease ( Amersham Biosciences ) per milligram of substrate for 16 h at 4 °C . Simultaneously , the GST - Nuf2 - Hec1 complex was expressed and puri - fied as described above and incubated with the flow through of PreScis - sion cleavage of the GST - Spc24 - Spc25 complex . After forming a quater - nary Ndc80 complex , PreScission protease was added to remove the GST moiety from Nuf2 . The quaternary complex was collected in the flow through , concentrated up to 5 mg / ml by Vivaspin ( molecular weight cut - off 30 , 000 ) and loaded onto a Superose 6 column equilibrated with size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) buffer ( 50 m M Tris - HCl pH 7 . 6 , 600 m M NaCl , 1 m M EDTA , 1 m M dithiothreitol , and 5 % glycerol ) . The final yield was estimated at (cid:1) 0 . 1 mg of pure complex per liter of bacteria . For binding assays and analytical SEC we also created the vectors pGEX - 6P - Nuf2 - ( 1 – 137 ) , pGEX - 6P - Nuf2 - ( 1 – 386 ) , pGEX - 6P - Nuf2 - ( 387 – 464 ) , pAM3 - His 6 - Hec1 - ( 1 – 230 ) , pAM3 - His 6 - Hec1 - ( 1 – 445 ) , pAM3 - His 6 - Hec1 - ( 446 – 642 ) , pGEX - 6P - 2RBS - Spc24 - ( 1 – 131 ) (cid:1) Spc25 - ( 1 – 144 ) , pGEX - 6P - 2RBS - hSpc24 - ( 1 – 131 ) (cid:1) hSpc25 - ( 145 – 224 ) , pGEX - 6P - 2RBS - hSpc24 - ( 132 – 197 ) (cid:1) hSpc25 - ( 1 – 144 ) , pGEX - 6P - 2RBS - hSpc24 - ( 132 – 197 ) (cid:1) hSpc25 - ( 145 – 224 ) , pGEX - 6P - 2RBS - GST - Nuf2 - ( 1 – 386 ) (cid:1) Hec1 - ( 1 – 445 ) , and pGEX - 6P - 2RBS - GST - Nuf2 - ( 387 – 464 ) (cid:1) Hec1 - ( 446 – 642 ) . These vectors were used for protein expression and purification essen - tially as described above for the quaternary Ndc80 , except that the salt concentrations of buffers were usually kept at 300 m M NaCl . Hydrodynamic Analysis— Analytical SEC was performed on a SMART system ( Amersham Biosciences ) using a Superdex 200 PC 3 . 2 / 30 column ( Amersham Biosciences ) . Elution volumes of bovine thy - roglobulin , rabbit aldolase , hen egg albumin , and ribonuclease A were plotted against their known Stokes radii ( 82 . 55 , 46 . 15 , 30 . 5 , and 16 . 4 Å , respectively ) to generate a calibration curve ( R 2 (cid:2) 0 . 98 ) from which the Stokes radius of Ndc80 was determined . For glycerol velocity gradients , samples were loaded directly onto 12 - ml 5 – 40 % glycerol gradients prepared by layering eight 1 . 5 - ml aliquots of gradient buffer ( 50 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 150 m M NaCl , 1 m M dithiothreitol , 1 m M EDTA , and 10 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) containing a decreasing glycerol concentration . Centrifugation was protracted for 48 h at 40 , 000 rpm on a Beckman SW41Ti swinging bucket rotor at 4 °C . The gradient was fractionated in 300 - (cid:1) l fractions , the content of which was visualized by SDS - PAGE after precipitation with trichloroacetic acid . Chymot - rypsinogen A ( 25 - kDa monomer , 2 . 58 S ) , bovine serum albumin ( 60 - kDa monomer , 4 . 22 S ) , aldolase ( 158 - kDa tetramer , 7 . 4 S ) , and catalase ( 240 - kDa tetramer , 11 . 3 S ) were also analyzed and their elution plotted against the known Svedberg coefficient . The resulting calibration curve ( R 2 (cid:2) 0 . 97 ) was used to determine the sedimentation coefficient ( s ) of the Ndc80 complex . The molecular weight was calculated from the Stokes radius ( a ) in Ångstroms and from s according to the equation molecular weight (cid:2) (cid:3) as ( 36 ) , where (cid:3) (cid:2) ( 6 (cid:4)(cid:5) 0 N ) / ( 1 (cid:3) (cid:6)(cid:7) ) , N is Avo - gadro’s number ( 6 . 02 (cid:4) 10 23 ) , (cid:5) 0 is the viscosity of medium ( g / ( cm (cid:1) s ) ) , (cid:7) is the density of the medium ( g / ml ) , and (cid:6) is the partial specific volume of the analyzed particle ( ml / g ) . Because (cid:5) 0 and (cid:7) values change accord - ing to the buffer composition and (cid:6) depends on the amino acidic com - position , the (cid:3) value was determined by plotting the molecular weights of standard proteins against their a (cid:4) s values . The axial ratio of the prolate ellipsoid of rotation was calculated as described ( 37 ) . GST Pull - down Experiments— GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described above . Binding of the GST fusion proteins to their interacting partners fused to a hexahistidine ( His 6 ) tag was tested by anti - His tag Western blotting ( WB ) . Each interaction was verified by at least three independent experiments . Binding Assay and Alexa Fluor 488 ( Alexa ) Labeling— Hec1 - ( 1 – 445 ) (cid:1) Nuf2 - ( 1 – 386 ) , Hec1 - ( 446 – 642 ) (cid:1) Nuf2 - ( 387 – 464 ) , Alexa - Spc24 - ( 1 – 197 ) (cid:1) Spc25 - ( 1 – 224 ) , and Alexa - Spc24 - ( 70 – 197 ) (cid:1) Spc25 - ( 57 – 224 ) subcom - plexes were analyzed on a Superdex TM 200 PC 3 . 2 / 30 SEC column . 35 - (cid:1) l fractions were collected , and their contents were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining . To test the interaction of the the subcomplexes , Hec1 - ( 1 – 445 ) (cid:1) Nuf2 - ( 1 – 386 ) or Hec1 - ( 446 – 642 ) (cid:1) Nuf2 - ( 387 – 464 ) were in - cubated fo r 2 h on icewith Alexa - Spc24 - ( 1 – 197 ) (cid:1) Spc25 - ( 1 – 224 ) or Alexa - Spc24 - ( 70 – 197 ) (cid:1) Spc25 - ( 57 – 224 ) . The reaction mixes were analyzed by SEC as described above . Proteins were labeled with Alexa - 488 succimidyl ester reactive dye ( Molecular Probes , Inc . ) as described ( 38 ) . Cell Culture , Injections , and Microscopy— HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( Invitrogen ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum and antibiotic / antimycotic solution and cultured in a 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 incubator . The culture of PtK1 cells and microinjection tech - niques were described previously ( 39 ) . For microinjection experiments , cells were grown on acid - washed coverslips in 35 - mm Petri dishes . Cells were microinjected with (cid:1) 1 – 5 % cell volume of Alexa - labeled Spc24 - Spc25 protein complex ( at 86 (cid:1) M needle concentration ) or Alexa - labeled Hec1 complex ( at 26 (cid:1) M needle concentration ) and then placed in Leibovitz’s dye - free L - 15 medium , pH 7 . 2 ( Sigma ) , supplemented with 7 m M Hepes , 1 The abbreviations used are : GST , glutathione S - transferase ; Alexa , Alexa Fluor 488 ; h ( prefix ) , human ; SEC , size exclusion chromatogra - phy ; SFM , scanning force microscopy ; WB , Western blotting . Reconstitution of Human Ndc80 - Hec1 Complex 29089 a t U n i v e r s it y o f N o r t h C a r o li n a a t C h a p e l H ill on D ece m b e r 21 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 10 % fetal bovine serum , an antibiotic / antimycotic solution , 4 . 5 g / liter glucose , and 0 . 45 units / ml Oxyrase ( Oxyrase Inc . , Mansfield , OH ) . HeLa cells injected with the Alexa - Spc24 - Spc25 complex or the Alexa - Ndc80 complex were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and subsequently perme - abilized with 1 % Triton X - 100 . Alexa - Spc24 – 25 - injected cells were incu - bated overnight at 4 °C with Hec1 primary antibodies ( Abcam , Cam - bridge , UK ) at a dilution of 1 : 750 ; Alexa - Ndc80 - injected cells were incubated with CREST serum ( Antibodies Inc . , Davis , CA ) at a dilution of 1 : 2000 . The secondary antibodies used were rhodamine Red - X anti - mouse for Alexa - Spc24 - Spc25 injected cells and rhodamine Red - X anti - human for Ndc80 complex - injected cells . Images were obtained using a Nikon 100 (cid:4) , 1 . 4 numerical aperture planapochromat oil immersion lens on a spinning disc confocal fluorescence microscope . For live cell imaging , cells on coverslips mounted into Rose chambers were imaged as described above . Scanning Force Microscopy— For imaging , 20 (cid:1) l of a diluted Ndc80 complex reconstituted as described above was deposited on freshly cleaved mica . After (cid:1) 30 s the mica was washed with water ( glass - distilled ; Sigma ) and exposed to a stream of filtered air . Images were obtained on a NanoScope IV ( Digital Instruments ; Santa Barbara , CA ) operating in tapping mode in air with a type E scanner . Silicon nanotips were from Digital Instruments ( Nanoprobes ) . RESULTS Domain Structure of the Human Ndc80 Complex— To inves - tigate the interactions connecting the four subunits of human Ndc80 we used a bacterial co - expression strategy . Dicistronic vectors were designed to express the first recombinant cistron as a C - terminal fusion to a His 6 tag or to GST . The second cistron was expressed as an untagged protein or as a His 6 tag fusion ( when the first cistron was fused to GST ) . In co - expres - sion experiments with the full - length proteins we determined that Nuf2 - Hec1 and Spc24 - Spc25 form two stable subcom - plexes ( see below ) . We exploited this observation to map the dimerization domains within each subcomplex by creating con - structs expected to coincide with the predicted globular and coiled coil ( 40 ) regions of Nuf2 , Hec1 , Spc24 , and Spc25 shown in Fig . 1 A . In a first set of experiments we tested the ability of His - Hec1 - ( 1 – 445 ) to bind different regions of Nuf2 fused to GST . His - Hec1 - ( 1 – 445 ) was co - expressed with GST , GST - Nuf2 - ( 1 – 385 ) , or GST - hNuf2 - ( 386 – 464 ) . Bacterial lysates were incubated with GSH - Sepharose , and any His - tagged Hec1 fusion protein bound to Nuf2 was detected by WB with an anti - His - tagged antibody . His - Hec1 - ( 1 – 445 ) bound tightly to GST - Nuf2 - ( 1 – 385 ) ( Fig . 1 B , lane 6 ) and not to GST or GST - hNuf2 - ( 386 – 464 ) ( lanes 3 and 9 ) . This result identifies an interaction between the N - terminal regions of Nuf2 and Hec1 . Next , we co - expressed His - Hec1 - ( 446 – 642 ) with GST , GST - Nuf2 - ( 1 – 385 ) , or GST - hNuf2 - ( 386 – 464 ) . Interestingly , we found a tight interaction between His - Hec1 - ( 446 – 642 ) and GST - hNuf2 - ( 386 – 464 ) ( lane 9 ) , whereas no binding was ob - served to GST or GST - Nuf2 - ( 1 – 385 ) ( lanes 3 and 6 ) . This ex - periment also indicated that GST - Nuf2 - ( 1 – 385 ) undergoes se - vere proteolytic degradation , and that it is stabilized by its interaction with His - Hec1 - ( 1 – 445 ) ( compare lanes 6 in panels B and C ) . Finally , we failed to detect binding between the pre - dicted N - terminal globular heads of Nuf2 and Hec1 , GST - Nuf2 - ( 1 – 137 ) and His - Hec1 - ( 1 – 230 ) ( not shown ) . In summary , the entire length of the coiled coils of Hec1 and Nuf2 is engaged in dimerization . The same approach was applied to Spc24 - Spc25 . First , we tested the ability of a His - tagged version of the N - terminal region of Spc25 ( His - Spc25 - ( 1 – 144 ) ) to bind GST - tagged ver - sions of the N - or C - terminal regions of Spc24 ( GST - Spc24 - ( 1 – 131 ) or GST - Spc24 - ( 132 – 197 ) ) . His - Spc25 - ( 1 – 144 ) bound tightly to GST - Spc24 - ( 1 – 131 ) ( Fig . 1 D , lane 6 ) . His - Spc25 - ( 1 – 144 ) also bound reproducibly to GST - Spc24 - ( 132 – 197 ) ( Fig . 1 D , lane 9 ) , but this may be an artifact caused by the instability of GST - Spc24 - ( 132 – 197 ) , which undergoes severe proteolytic deg - radation . Next , we tested the predicted C - terminal globular domain of Spc25 ( His - Spc25 - ( 145 – 224 ) ) against GST - Spc24 - ( 1 – 131 ) and GST - Spc24 - ( 132 – 197 ) . His - Spc25 - ( 145 – 224 ) bound weakly to GST - Spc24 - ( 132 – 197 ) ( Fig . 1 E , lane 9 ) . As explained above , this might also be an artifact caused by the instability of GST - Spc24 - ( 132 – 197 ) . However , at least a fraction of GST - Spc24 - ( 132 – 197 ) was protected from degradation upon co - ex - pression with His - Spc25 - ( 145 – 224 ) , suggesting that the latter stabilizes Spc24 - ( 132 – 197 ) presumably because it binds to it . No binding was observed between His - Spc25 - ( 145 – 224 ) and GST - Spc24 - ( 1 – 131 ) . As for Nuf2 and Hec1 , the binding studies with Spc24 and Spc25 suggest that the interaction between these proteins involves coiled coil domains organized in a co - linear and parallel arrangement ( see “Discussion” ) . Domains Required for Tetramerization of the Ndc80 Com - plex— Next , we sought to identify the domains in the Spc24 - Spc25 and Nuf2 - Hec1 subcomplexes responsible for tetramer - ization of the Ndc80 complex . We tested to determine if Nuf2 - ( 1 – 385 ) (cid:1) Hec1 - ( 1 – 445 ) and Nuf2 - ( 386 – 464 ) (cid:1) Hec1 - ( 446 – 642 ) , stable dimeric partners of Nuf2 - Hec1 ( Fig . 1 ) , bound full - length Spc24 - Spc25 or Spc24 - ( 70 – 197 ) (cid:1) Spc25 - ( 57 – 224 ) , a stable di - meric fragment of Spc24 - Spc25 identified by limited proteolysis ( data not shown ) . All dimeric constructs were generated by co - expression in E . coli and purified on GSH - Sepharose beads . After release from the GST moiety by protease cleavage , the samples were analyzed by SEC on a Superdex 200 column as shown in Fig . 2 , A – D . To facilitate the interpretation of the SEC profiles , we covalently labeled full - length Spc24 - Spc25 and Spc24 - ( 70 – 197 ) (cid:1) Spc25 - ( 57 – 224 ) with the fluorophore Alexa Fluor 488 to track elution at both 280 and 495 nm . The elution profiles of the individual dimeric constructs Alexa - Spc24 - Spc25 , Spc24 - ( 70 – 197 ) (cid:1) Spc25 - ( 57 – 224 ) , Nuf2 - ( 1 – 385 ) (cid:1) Hec1 - ( 1 – 445 ) , and Nuf2 - ( 386 – 464 ) (cid:1) Hec1 - ( 446 – 642 ) are shown in Fig . 2 , A – D for reference . To identify the domains linking Hec1 - Nuf2 to Spc24 – 25 , we mixed roughly stoichiometric amounts of each purified dimer for 2 h at 4 °C . SEC analysis of the resulting products revealed that Nuf2 - ( 1 – 385 ) (cid:1) Hec1 - ( 1 – 445 ) was unable to bind full - length Spc24 - Spc25 or Spc24 - ( 70 – 197 ) (cid:1) Spc25 - ( 57 – 224 ) . In both cases , the di - meric fragments eluted separately with unaltered elution vol - umes relative to those of the isolated dimers ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) . On the other hand , Nuf2 - ( 386 – 464 ) (cid:1) Hec1 - ( 446 – 642 ) bound full - length Alexa - Spc24 - Spc25 . The four proteins eluted together in a single peak , the elution volume of which was significantly smaller relative to that of the individual dimeric constituents , indicative of a larger Stokes radius ( Fig . 2 G ) . Using a similar analysis , we found that Nuf2 - ( 386 – 464 ) (cid:1) Hec1 - ( 446 – 642 ) was un - able to form a tetramer when mixed with the Spc24 - ( 70 – 197 ) (cid:1) Spc25 - ( 57 – 224 ) subcomplex , indicating that the N - terminal regions of Spc24 and Spc25 missing from this construct are necessary for the tetramerization of the Ndc80 complex ( Fig . 2 H ) . Thus , our studies identify the dimeric fragment containing the C - terminal segments of Nuf2 - Hec1 as being sufficient to mediate the formation of a tetramer with Spc24 - Spc25 , whose N - terminal regions are necessary for binding . Reconstitution of the Ndc80 Complex— The dicistronic config - urations Hec1 - Nuf2 and Spc24 - Spc25 , described above , were used successfully to express soluble full - length subcomplexes of Ndc80 tagged with GST or a His tag ( Fig . 3 , A and B ; Spc25 and Spc24 appear to co - migrate in this gel , and the same happens for Hec1 and GST - Nuf2 ) . Co - expression generated soluble com - plexes that could be purified using affinity chromatography and SEC . With no other combination of subunits we obtained stable subcomplexes that rescue the insolubility of the individ - ual subunits ( data not shown ) , confirming that Nuf2 - Hec1 and Spc24 - Spc25 represent physically well defined subcomplexes .

While still bound onto the beads , the Spc24 - Spc25 was removed from the GST moiety by proteolytic cleavage and subsequently incubated with limiting amounts of GST - Nuf2 - Hec1 immobilized on beads . After removing the excess Spc24 - Spc25 , the resulting GST - Nuf2 - Hec1 - Spc24 - Spc25 complex was released from beads by proteolysis , concentrated by ultra - filtration , and analyzed by SEC on a Superose 6 PC 3 . 2 / 30 column ( Fig . 3 C ) . The SEC elution profile revealed a single prominent peak with an elution volume corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of (cid:1) 700 – 800 kDa . SDS - PAGE anal - ysis revealed that the peak contained all four subunits of the Ndc80 complex in a pure form and in apparently stoichiometric proportions ( Fig . 3 C ) . We wished to know if the Stokes radius of the endogenous human Ndc80 complex was comparable with that of the recom - F IG . 1 . Identification of subcomplexes of the Ndc80 complex .

Note that in panel B GST - Nuf2 - ( 1 – 385 ) is partly protected from degradation through its binding to His - Hec1 - ( 1 – 445 ) ( lane 6 ) When no binding occurs , as in lane 6 of panel C , the segment is unstable and degraded .

Reconstitution of Human Ndc80 - Hec1 Complex 29091 a t U n i v e r s it y o f N o r t h C a r o li n a a t C h a p e l H ill on D ece m b e r 21 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m binant complex . For this question we lysed cycling HeLa cells , separated the lysate by SEC on the same Superose 6 PC 3 . 2 / 30 column , and analyzed different fractions of the eluate by WB with an anti - Hec1 antibody ( Fig . 3 D ) . The elution profile of endogenous Hec1 , which we assume to be part of a larger complex with Nuf2 , Spc24 , and Spc25 , was essentially identical to that of the recombinant Ndc80 complex ( shown in Fig . 3 C ) , suggesting that the recombinant and endogenous Ndc80 com - plexes have similar Stokes radii . Hydrodynamic Characterization of the Ndc80 Complex— Be - cause the predicted molecular mass of the Ndc80 complex is 176 kDa ( assuming a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 stoichiometry ) , its elution volume suggested the possibility that the complex forms higher oli - gomers . However , because all four subunits of Ndc80 are prob - ably elongated because of a high content of coiled coil structure , the Stokes radius of the complex ( and therefore its elution volume ) may deviate significantly from that expected for a globular protein of equivalent molecular mass . The Stokes radius of recombinant Ndc80 was derived from a calibration curve of SEC elution volume and determined to be (cid:1) 90 Å ( see “Materials and Methods” ) . This result is very sim - ilar to the 87 - Å value proposed for the endogenous Ndc80 complex in budding yeast ( 10 ) . Next , we determined the sedi - mentation behavior of the Ndc80 complex using glycerol den - sity gradients ( 5 – 40 % ) . This experiment returned a sedimen - tation coefficient of (cid:1) 4 . 8 S ( Fig . 3 E ) . With these values we used the Siegel and Monty equation ( 36 ) to calculate the molecular mass of the recombinant Ndc80 complex and obtained a value of 177 kDa , in excellent agreement with the predicted molecu - lar mass of (cid:1) 176 kDa . Thus , the combination of SEC and sedimentation in glycerol gradients allowed us to conclude that the recombinant Ndc80 complex is a stoichiometric 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 com - plex with a molecular mass of 177 kDa . To confirm that the endogenous Ndc80 complex sediments similarly to the recom - binant one , we subjected cell lysates from cycling HeLa cells to sedimentation in glycerol density gradients and analyzed the resulting fractions by WB with an anti - Hec1 antibody . As shown in Fig . 3 F , the sedimentation properties of endogenous Ndc80 were indistinguishable from those of the recombinant complex , indicating that the recombinant complex is a faithful copy of the endogenous Ndc80 complex . Overall , these studies show that the human Ndc80 complex is very elongated . The hydrodynamic parameters of the recombinant and endogenous human Ndc80 complexes indicate that this type of complex can be modeled as a prolate ellipsoid of revolution with the axial ratio a / b (cid:2) 21 ( Fig . 3 G ) . Similar values have been recently reported for the endogenous Ndc80 complexes of S . cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis ( 10 , 24 ) . The Recombinant Ndc80 Complex Localizes to Kineto - chores— We tried to corroborate the idea that the recombinant complex represents a good model for the endogenous complex , asking if it was capable of reaching the mitotic kinetochore when injected in PtK1 or HeLa cells . Toward this end , we covalently labeled the Spc24 - Spc25 subcomplex with Alexa Fluor 488 . Alexa - Spc24 - Spc25 was used either directly for in - jection or to reconstitute a fluorescent version of the entire Ndc80 complex . For this experiment the fluorescently labeled Spc24 - Spc25 subcomplex was mixed with solid phase bound GST - Nuf2 - Hec1 , and the resulting complex was further puri - fied as described above for the unlabeled complex . Prophase PtK1 or mitotic HeLa cells were microinjected with 1 – 5 % cell volume of the Alexa - labeled Spc24 - Spc25 complex F IG . 2 . Identification of a domain for Ndc80 complex tetramerization .

We also injected three prophase PtK1 and 11 HeLa mitotic cells with the Alexa - Ndc80 complex , and all cells showed strong kinetochore localization ( Fig . 4 , B and D ) .

With the preliminary word of caution that dimensions are rather distorted in SFM images and only allow relative rather than absolute size assessments , the height of the larger blob is (cid:1) 9 – 10 nm , and that of the central shaft and the opposite end is 3 – 4 - nm - high . Based on the fact that the predicted globular regions of Hec1 - Nuf2 are signifi - cantly larger than those of Spc24 - Spc25 ( Fig . 1 ) , we suspect that the larger blob corresponds to the globular regions at the N termini of the Hec1 - Nuf2 subcomplex . The smaller globular region at the opposite end of the shaft appears to be split into two distinct blobs of density . If our assignment of domains is correct , this observation predicts that the C - terminal globular domains of Spc24 - Spc24 are separated , an unexpected finding based on our binding studies in Fig . 1 that will require further future investigations . DISCUSSION Our results have interesting implications for understanding the overall organization of the Ndc80 complex . At the resolu - tion of our analysis , the dimerization interfaces we identified coincide with the coiled coil regions of Nuf2 and Hec1 . The colinearity of the interaction suggests that the intermolecular coiled coil of Hec1 and Nuf2 is parallel . This organization explains why Hec1 and Nuf2 are mutually dependent on their stability ( see , for instance , Refs . 28 and 33 ) . Spc24 and Spc25 , on the other hand , are predicted to contain relatively short N - terminal coiled coils and small C - terminal globular domains , and also in this case we observed colinearity of the het - erodimerization interface . The colinearity of the Hec1 - Nuf2 and Spc24 - Spc25 subcomplexes is consistent with the observed Stokes radii for different segments of the complex , which in - crease with an imperfect but consistent additive rule with increasing protein size . For instance , Spc24 - ( 70 – 197 ) (cid:1) Spc25 - ( 57 – 224 ) and full - length Spc24 - Spc25 have Stokes radii of 28 and 37 Å , respectively , whereas Nuf2 - ( 386 – 464 ) (cid:1) Hec1 - ( 446 – 642 ) and Nuf2 - ( 1 – 385 ) (cid:1) Hec1 - ( 1 – 445 ) have Stokes radii of 42 and 65 Å , respectively ( data not shown ) . The full - length qua - ternary complex has a Stokes radius of 90 Å . This suggests that the different sub - domains of the Ndc80 complex extend linearly to build a progressively more elongated shape . The tetramer - ization of the Nuf2 - Hec1 and Spc24 - Spc25 subcomplexes is mediated by the encounter of the C - terminal regions of Nuf2 - Hec1 and the N - terminal regions of Spc24 - Spc25 . We failed to observe interactions between other portions of these subcom - plexes , suggesting that the tetramerization domain involves a relatively small portion of the Ndc80 complex . This information can be nicely fitted into the shape of the Ndc80 complex imaged by SFM . We predict that the parallel coiled coil of Hec1 - Nuf2 contributes the most prominent frac - tion of the central shaft . It also accommodates the tetramer - ization domain and the N - terminal coiled coil of Spc24 - Spc25 . In the absence of high resolution structural information , it is difficult to say whether the coiled coil regions of Hec1 - Nuf2 and F IG . 4 . Localization of Hec1 and Spc24 - Spc25 subcomplexes at the kinetochore . A and B , prophase PtK1 cells were injected with Alexa - labeled Spc24 - Spc25 subcomplex ( A ) or Alexa - labeled Ndc80 com - plex ( B ) and imaged by live cell fluorescence microscopy . Strong kine - tochore staining is observed . Phase contrast ( left ) , fluorescence ( center ) , and merged images ( right ) are shown . C and D , mitotic HeLa cells were injected with Alexa - labeled Spc24 - Spc25 subcomplex ( C ) or Alexa - la - beled Hec1 - Nuf2 - Spc24 - Spc25 ( D ) . After injection , cells were either filmed by live cell fluorescence microscopy ( not shown ) or fixed . In panel C the localization of Alexa - labeled Spc24 - Spc25 is shown together with that of endogenous Hec1 as revealed by indirect immunofluorescence . The right section s hows perfect co - localization of the two signals . In panel D the signal from Alexa - labeled Hec1 - Nuf2 - Spc24 - Spc25 is com - pared with that of CREST , a centromeric marker . As expected , the kinetochore signal of the Ndc80 complex lies at two bright dots external to CREST ( see inset ) . F IG . 5 . Summary of structural features of the Ndc80 complex . A , zoom ( left and middle ) and tilt ( right ) images of individual Ndc80 complexes imaged by SFM . Two globular regions are located at each end of a central shaft . The white bar corresponds to 10 nm . B , the elongated Ndc80 complex contains globular regions at each end of a central shaft containing the coiled coils of the Hec1 - Nuf and Spc24 - Spc5 subcom - plexes . The tetramerization domain is proposed to involve the C termini of the Hec1 - Nuf2 coiled coil and the N termini of the Spc24 - Spc25 coiled coils . The bridge between subcomplexes might consist of overlapping C - and N - terminal segments of Hec1 and Spc24 , respectively , as these may be unpaired to the Nuf2 and Spc25 chains , respectively ( see “Discus - sion” ) . C , an (cid:1) 40 - nm gap of unknown composition separates the inner plate of the kinetochore from the outer plate . Microtubule plus ends terminate on the outer plate . The fibrous corona ( not shown ) is only visible on unattached kinetochores and may be altered after microtu - bule arrival ( 1 ) . Two possible orientations of the Ndc80 complex are shown . Reconstitution of Human Ndc80 - Hec1 Complex 29094 a t U n i v e r s it y o f N o r t h C a r o li n a a t C h a p e l H ill on D ece m b e r 21 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Spc24 - Spc25 extend in a single direction or whether they invert their direction , creating a more complex pattern . The paired coiled coil segment of the Hec1 - Nuf2 subcomplex may extend for 250 – 300 residues , allowing for 75 – 85 helical turns and a predicted length of 40 – 45 nm , similar to the length of the complex imaged by SFM . Assuming that the pairing of the Nuf2 and Hec1 coiled coils starts at their N - terminal ends , an overhang containing the C terminus of Hec1 is expected ( Fig . 5 B ) . We postulate that this overhang might mediate the inter - action with the N - terminal regions of Spc24 - Spc25 . By limited proteolysis , we found that the N - terminal regions of the Spc24 - Spc25 subcomplex are unstable in the absence of Hec1 - Nuf2 ( data not shown ) . In these experiments , longer N - terminal segments of Spc24 are removed relative to Spc25 , suggesting that the N - terminal region of Spc24 has unpaired regions that might mediate pairing of Spc24 - Spc25 with Nuf2 - Hec1 . We also expect that the opposing globular regions flanking the central shaft contain the N termini of the Hec1 - Nuf2 subcom - plex and the C termini of Spc24 - Spc25 , respectively ( Fig . 5 B ) . This organization is similar to that very recently proposed for the Ndc80 complex of S . cerevisiae ( 41 ) . The length of the Ndc80 complex is very close to the 40 - nm thickness attributed to the kinetochore outer plate ( 13 – 18 ) . The model is compatible with ( but does not imply ) the possibility that the Ndc80 complex orients perpendicularly to the kinetochore outer surface , accounting for the whole thickness of the outer plate ( Fig . 5 C ) . Of note , other evolutionarily conserved kineto - chore complexes interacting with the Ndc80 complex , such as the Mtw1 - Mis12 complex , have been proposed to be elongated and might adopt a similar orientation in the kinetochore outer plate ( 10 ) . Important questions raised by this model regard the posi - tioning of the opposing globular ends and the identity of their binding partners . Our injection studies with fluorescent con - structs show that Spc24 - Spc25 reaches its normal kinetochore localization in the absence of Hec1 - Nuf2 ( Fig . 4 ) . The injected cells completed mitosis normally , suggesting the possibility that the injected Spc24 - Spc25 subcomplex is normally incorporated in the larger Ndc80 assembly or that it does not interfere with kinetochore function if recruited to kinetochores independently of Hec1 - Nuf2 . We asked if Hec1 - Nuf2 was required for kinetochore recruitment of Spc24 - Spc25 by injecting HeLa cells with Alexa - Spc24 - ( 70 – 197 ) (cid:1) Spc25 - ( 57 – 224 ) , which is unable to bind Hec1 - Nuf2 . Kinetochore localization of Spc24 - ( 70 – 197 ) (cid:1) Spc25 - ( 57 – 224 ) was dramatically reduced relative to that of the full - length Spc24 - Spc25 subcomplex shown in Fig . 4 ( not shown ) . The exper - iment , however , was not conclusive , because some faint but rec - ognizable kinetochore decoration was still visible in a subset of injected cells . The recombinant Ndc80 complex is endowed with all known properties of the endogenous Ndc80 complex . Our results un - derscore the relevance of biochemical reconstitution strategies to combine the study of complex protein behavior in vitro and in living cells . We tested the ability of recombinant Ndc80 to bind recombinant segments of Mad1 , a spindle checkpoint compo - nent indicated as a possible binding partner of the Hec1 and Spc25 subunits ( 31 , 42 ) . To date , however , we have failed to detect a direct interaction between Mad1 and the Ndc80 com - plex ( not shown ) . In the future , we plan to test the interaction of the Ndc80 complex with its partners at the kinetochore , dissect the requirements for its recruitment to kinetochores , and understand its contributions to microtubule binding .

The protein complex was subsequently digested in solution overnight at room temperature with trypsin ( Sigma ) in 1 : 25 w / w ratio ( enzyme : substrate ) . The sample was then acidified with TFA ( Sigma ) to a final concentration of 1 % . The phosphopeptides were enriched using titanosphere chromatography ( TiO2 ) as described originally ( Larsen et al . , 2005 ) and subsequently adapted ( Olsen et al . , 2006 ) with some modifications . The eluate from titanosphere was injected via Agilent 1100 Nano HPLC system on to spray emitter ( 100 µm internal diameter , 8 µm opening 70 mm length ; New Objective ) packed with C18 beads ( Reprosil - Pur C18 - AQ 3 µm ) . The enriched peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from buffer A ( 5 % acetonitrile and 0 . 5 % acetic acid ) to a buffer B ( 0 . 5 % acetic acid in acetonitrile ) going from 0 % to 20 % buffer B in 30 min at 0 . 3 µl / min . The nano HPLC was connected on line with 7 - tesla Finnigan LTQ - FT ( Thermo Electron , Bremen , Germany ) mass spectrometer . The machine was operating in data dependent mode acquisition automatically switching between MS , MS / MS and neutral loss MS3 . The full MS scan ( 400 - 2000 m / z ) was acquired by the FTICR the tree most intense ions were selected for SIM scan ( Selected Ion Monitoring ) by FTICR while their MS / MS was acquired in the linear ion trap . The MS3 scan was trigged by the loss of 97 . 97 Da , 48 . 99 Da , and 32 . 66 Da within the 10 most intense fragment ions . Peaks from the raw file were picked using DtaSuperCharge ( http : / / msquant . sourceforge . net / ) . The peak list was searched against SwissProt using Mascot ( version 2 . 0 ) with the following parameters : monoisotopic mass values , instrument ESI - TRAP , peptide tolerance 10 ppm on the precursor and 0 . 5 Da on the fragment Ions , carbammidomethylation as fixed modification , oxidation on methionine and phosphorylation of serine , threonine and tyrosine as variable modification . The phosphorylated peptides identified by Mascot were manually validated . Microtubule co - sedimentation assay and quantification Tubulin was purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc . and microtubules were polymerized according to the producer’s instructions . All microtubule sedimentation assays were carried out with wt Ndc80 bonsai . For microtubule - binding reactions , microtubules were diluted in general tubulin ( GT ) buffer ( 80 mM PIPES pH 6 . 8 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 50 µM Paclitaxel ) . 1 µM Ndc80 bonsai in 25 mM Tris , 150 mM NaCl pH 7 . 6 and 1 µM BSA were added to a final reaction volume of 50 µl . Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 10 min , transferred onto 100 µl of cushion buffer ( 80 mM PIPES pH 6 . 8 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 50 µM Paclitaxel , 50 % glycerol ) and ultracentrifuged for 10 min at 90 , 000 rpm in a Beckman TLA100 rotor at 25 °C . Pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . For co - sedimentation assays with subtilisin - treated microtubules , 20 µM Paclitaxel - stabilized microtubules were incubated for 30 min at 30°C with 200 µg / ml subtilisin A ( Calbiochem ) . The reaction was stopped with 10 mM PMSF , digested microtubules were pelleted ( 90 , 000 rpm , TLA100 , 10 min , 25 °C ) and resuspended in the original volume of GT buffer ( Miranda et al . , 2007 ; Skiniotis et al . , 2004 ) . The assay was then carried out as described above . For the Aurora B assay , we incubated 1 µM Ndc80 bonsai with 1 mM ATP and variable concentrations of Aurora B kinase ( a kind gift of Fabio Sessa ) for 30 min at 30°C . Paclitaxel - stabilized microtubules ( 2 µM tubulin dimer concentration ) were added for 10 min at room temperature and co - sedimentation was carried out as described above . Gel densitometry was carried with ImageJ ( Abramoff , 2004 ) . Normalized binding data were obtained by dividing the values of the pellet fraction by the sum of pellet and supernatant . The normalized binding data were fitted to the following quadratic equation : Complex formed = ( B t + K d + x ) − B t + K d + x ( ) 2 − 4B t x ( ) 2 Where B t is the maximal fractional Ndc80 bonsai - tubulin complex , K d is the dissociation constant , and x is the concentration of tubulin dimer . Fitting analysis and K d calculation were carried out using GraphPad Prism , version 4 . 0 ( GraphPad software , Inc . ) Microtubule binding assays using fluorescence microscopy Purified Ndc80 complex ( ~ 1 mg ) was incubated with Alexa - 488 - C5 - maleimide ( 0 . 1 mg ) ( Molecular Probes ) for 30 min at RT in the dark . The labeled protein was purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column ( GE Healthcare ) . Tubulin and rhodamine - tubulin ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) were polymerised according to the manufacturer in order to obtain a rhodamine - tubulin : tubulin ratio of 0 . 16 . The binding assay was performed in a final 50 µ l volume in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris / HCl , 100 mM NaCl , 20 µ M Paclitaxel . Alexa - 488 Ndc80 complex , at increasing concentrations ( 0 . 0125 - 1 . 16 µ M ) , was incubated for 10 min with rhodamine - labeled microtubules ( 0 . 1 µ M ) and then transferred into glass - bottom 96 - well SensoPlate ( International PBI ) previously coated with polylysine . Fluorescence images were acquired with 2x2 binning and 0 . 5 sec exposure time using an IX81 Olympus motorized inverted microscope with a 100x planApo oil immersion objective ( NA 1 . 35 ) , a FVIEWII b / w CCD camera ( Olympus , Germany ) and ImageJ image processing software ( W . Rasband , National Institute of Health , Bethesda , USA ) for image editing . Microinjection HeLa cells were cultured and microinjected as previously described ( DeLuca et al . , 2005 ; Howell et al . , 2000 ) . Prometaphase HeLa cells were microinjected with approximately 2 - 10 % cell volume of Alexa - 488 - labeled Ndc80 bonsai ( Ciferri et al . , 2005 ) at a needle concentration of approximately 50 µM . Cells were imaged on a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope with a Nikon 100X / NA 1 . 4 Plan Apo oil - immersion objective , a Yokogawa Spinning Disk Confocal system , a Hamamatsu Orca II ER cooled - CCD camera , and MetaMorph image processing software . Fluorescence images were collected with 2x2 binning and 2 sec exposure time . Electron microscopy Paclitaxel - and GMPCPP microtubules were polymerised using standard methods and were diluted to 2 . 5 µM in EM buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 6 , 100 mM NaCl ) . The microtubules were either applied directly to EM grids or were incubated for 5 minutes with Ndc80 bonsai to a final concentration of 1 . 3 µM polymerised tubulin and ~ 3 µM of Ndc80 bonsai . 4 µl of each sample was applied to a glow - discharged , home made continuous carbon EM grid . The grid was washed in EM buffer prior to staining using 1 % uranyl acetate . Images were collected on a Tecnai T12 electron microscope , operating at 120 kV . EM images were collected at 1 . 5 - 2 . 5 µm underfocus using a Gatan CCD camera and the software Digital Micrograph . Supplemental Discussion Interpretation of mass spectrometry data Coiled - coil pairing of the Ndc80 - Nuf2 sub - complex starts at 262 Ndc80 and 149 Nuf2 . About 100 residues downstream from this point on both chains , a crosslink between Lys360 Ndc80 and Lys252 Nuf2 indicates that the register is retained . Residues in the next crosslink , Lys462 Ndc80 - Lys299 Nuf2 , are 102 and only 47 residues away from Lys360 Ndc80 - Lys252 Nuf2 on Ndc80 and Nuf2 , respectively , revealing a ~ 50 - residue insertion in Ndc80 . An analogous ~ 60 - residue decrease in coiled - coil propensity around residue 475 is also observed in ScNdc80 ( not shown ) . In EM images , ScNdc80 bends considerably at a point situated at approximately 2 / 5 of its length ( Wei et al . , 2005 ) , consistent with the predicted coiled - coil discontinuity . The new register after the insertion is maintained until the C - termini of Nuf2 and Ndc80 , as confirmed by the Lys504 Ndc80 - Lys348 Nuf2 crosslink and by a network of cross - links in the tetramerization domain . The register of the Spc24 - Spc25 sub - complex is also defined , with cross - links Lys60 Spc24 - Lys50 Spc25 and Lys98 Spc24 - Lys84 Spc25 that are in perfect agreement with the register observed in the crystal structure of the Ndc80 ∆ N - bonsai complex . The tetramerization region is likely to be made of a coiled - coil core contributed by Ndc80 and Nuf2 , and by a ~ 60 - residue overlap with helical segments of Spc24 and Spc25 . This argument is based on 1 ) the fact that the coiled - coil prediction for Ndc80 and Nuf2 extends until the end of the sequence , so that the chain pairing is likely to be maintained ; 2 ) the fact that the N - terminal regions of Spc24 and Spc25 are rather unstable in the absence of the Ndc80 - Nuf2 dimer , as judged by limited proteolysis ( Ciferri et al . , 2005 ; Wei et al . , 2006 ; Wei et al . , 2005 ) ; 3 ) the fact that the cross - linking itself suggests that the conformation of the N - terminal segments of Spc24 and Spc25 extend at about the same pace as the C - terminal regions of Ndc80 - Nuf2 . Specifically , Lys577 Ndc80 is linked to the N - terminal amino group of Spc24 , which is in turn linked to Lys400 Nuf2 or alternatively to Lys418 Nuf2 . Thus , the N - terminus of Spc24 faces a region that we assume to be near the midpoint between Lys400 Nuf2 and Lys418 Nuf2 . The N - terminus of Spc25 , on the other hand , crosslinks to Lys416 Nuf2 , and is therefore offset by only a few residues ( less than ten ) from the N - terminus of Spc24 ( the N - terminal region of Spc24 contains five additional residues as a result of its cleavage from GST during purification ) . As shown in Figure 6 of the main text , the cross - links between Lys50 Spc25 and Lys60 Spc24 and between Lys52 Spc25 and Lys633 Ndc80 form a consistent set that is in agreement with the idea that the four chains extend at the same pace within the tetramerization domain , which would be possible if all chains had the same helical conformation . The region of overlap in the tetramerization domain is predicted to engage approximately 60 - 65 residues of each chain . We suspect that the N - terminal regions of Spc24 and Spc25 fold into a stable helical conformation only when they have a chance to interact with the Hec1 - Nuf2 dimer , and are otherwise unstable . The “patchy” distribution of Alexa - Ndc80 bonsai does not reflect “speckles” The theoretical bases for the formation of fluorescence speckles have been discussed ( Waterman - Storer and Salmon , 1998 ) . The fluorescent speckle pattern reflects variations in the distribution of fluorophores in intervals of size comparable to the diffraction limit ( Waterman - Storer and Salmon , 1998 ) . In treating the incorporation of fluorescent tubulin subunits in the microtubule lattice , Waterman - Storer and Salmon ( 1998 ) noted that the probability of incorporation of a fluorescent subunit depends directly on the fraction ( f ) of labeled dimers in the tubulin pool . These authors argued that the fluorescent speckle pattern is produced by variations from the mean number of fluorescent subunits incorporated in the lattice . The standard deviation ( SD ) for the random process of subunit incorporation into the lattice is approximately the square root of the mean . The high standard deviation at small values of f explains the speckle pattern ( Waterman - Storer and Salmon , 1998 ) . The contrast is given by the ratio SD / mean . Obviously , it is higher when the mean is low and the SD is high , i . e . at low f values . For our studies , we used 16 % rhodaminated tubulin relative to unlabeled tubulin , i . e . f = 16 % . As there are ~ 440 tubulin dimers within the length of our diffraction limit ( 270 nm ) , the theoretical mean is 0 . 16 x 440 = 70 . 4 , and the SD is 8 . 4 . Thus , the predicted contrast is ~ 0 . 12 . The observed contrast of the four microtubules shown in Figure 5 ranged between 0 . 14 and 0 . 18 , in line with the predicted values . This result confirms that rhodaminated tubulin is incorporated randomly into microtubules . As we observe saturation of Ndc80 binding to microtubules at an approximately 1 : 1 N / T ratio ( Figure 5 ) , we can assume that at an N / T ratio of 0 . 125 the fraction of labeled Ndc80 complex bound to the microtubules is f = 12 . 5 % . Thus , the theoretical mean is 0 . 125 x 440 = 55 and the SD is 7 . 4 . The predicted contrast at this N / T ratio is 0 . 13 . The observed contrast of green ( Ndc80 ) fluorescence ranges between 0 . 98 and 1 . 1 for the two microtubules in Figure 5C . This high contrast is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the observed distribution is caused by a random distribution of the Ndc80 fluorophores on the microtubules . We conclude that the Ndc80 complexes cluster on microtubules . At an N / T ratio of 1 , the contrast of Ndc80 fluorescence was 0 . 14 for both microtubules in Figure 5E , in agreement with the idea that the Ndc80 complex is evenly distributed at this high ratio .

Analysis of the relative orientation of CH domains in different proteins A ) Superposition of the Ndc80 and EB1 CH domains . Residues 89 - 199 of Ndc80 were superimposed onto residues 1 - 130 of EB1 ( PDB ID code 1pa7 Hayashi and Ikura , 2003 ) . The root mean square deviation ( r . m . s . d . ) of the superposition of 87 C α atoms was 3 . 386 Å . The two Ndc80 CH domains are essentially identical , with a r . m . s . d . of 0 . 452 Å over 111 C α atoms ( not shown ) . B ) Superposition of the Nuf2 and EB1 CH domains . Residues 11 - 130 of Nuf2 were superimposed onto residues 1 - 130 of EB1 ( PDB ID code 1pa7 Hayashi and Ikura , 2003 ) . The root mean square deviation ( r . m . s . d . ) of the superposition of 79 C α atoms was 3 . 531 Å . C ) To emphasize the differences in CH domain arrangements , Ndc80 ( left panels ) or Nuf2 ( right panels ) CH domains are superposed to the CH1 or CH2 domains of α - actinin ( PDB ID code 2eyn ) ( Borrego - Diaz et al . , 2006 ) , which are shown in grey and black , respectively . In the upper panels , the grey CH1 domain of α - actinin was superimposed onto the Ndc80 ( left ) or the Nuf2 ( right ) CH domain . In either case , the black CH2 domain of α - actinin ( i . e . the one that was not superimposed ) does not overlap with the CH domain in the Ndc80 - Nuf2 assembly to which it was not superimposed , as expected if the reciprocal arrangement of the CH domains in Ndc80 and α - actinin were different . In the lower panels , the same exercise was carried out on the black CH2 domain of α - actinin , which was superimposed onto the Ndc80 ( left ) or Nuf2 ( right ) CH domain . As before , the grey CH1 domain does not superimpose onto a CH domain from the Ndc80 - Nuf2 assembly . This shows that the arrangement of CH domains in the Ndc80 - Nuf2 assembly is distinct from that in α - actinin . Figure S6 .

There is a similar pattern of charge distribution , with two areas with positive charge , with in between a negatively charged area . Figure S8 . Differences in the Ndc80 ∆ N - bonsai complexes of the asymmetric unit The two Ndc80 ∆ N - bonsai complexes in the crystal’s asymmetric unit are organized similarly , but there are significant differences in the arrangement of each complex’s structural elements . Not only the coiled - coil regions point to different directions with respect to the Nuf2 globular domain , but also the relative orientation of the globular regions of Nuf2 and Ndc80 varies ) . These differences lead to coiled - coils pointing in directions 30° apart with respect to the globular head of Ndc80 . A ) Ribbon models of the two Ndc80 ∆ N - bonsai complexes in the asymmetric unit after least square superposition of the globular heads of Nuf2 . Dimer 1 is drawn with light colors , dimer 2 with darker colors . Arrows highlight the relative change in orientation of the Nuf2 and Ndc80 globular domains . The dotted line represents a portion of coiled - coil in dimer 2 that could not be built because it is in poor density . B ) Ribbon models of the two Ndc80 ∆ N - bonsai complexes in the asymmetric unit after least square superposition of the globular heads of Ndc80 . Table S1 .
