Las17p / Bee1p has been shown to be important for actin patch assembly and actin polymerization . Here we show that Las17p interacts with the Arp2 / 3 complex . LAS17 is an allele - speciﬁc multicopy suppressor of ARP2 and ARP3 mutations ; overexpression restores both actin patch organization and endocytosis defects in ARP2 temperature - sensitive ( ts ) cells . Six of seven ARP2 ts mutants and at least one ARP3 ts mutant are synthetically lethal with las17 D ts conﬁrming functional interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex . Further characterization of las17 D cells showed that receptor - mediated internalization of a factor by the Ste2 receptor is severely defective . The polarity of normal bipolar bud site selection is lost . Las17 - gfp remains localized in cortical patches in vivo independently of polymerized actin and is required for the polarized localization of Arp2 / 3 as well as actin . Coimmunoprecipitation of Arp2p with Las17p indicates that Las17p interacts directly with the complex . Two hybrid results also suggest that Las17p interacts with actin , verprolin , Rvs167p and several other proteins including Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain proteins , suggesting that Las17p may integrate signals from different regulatory cascades destined for the Arp2 / 3p complex and the actin cytoskeleton . INTRODUCTION Arp2p and Arp3p are essential ubiquitous proteins of the actin - related family localized in actin - rich cortical structures ( McCollum et al . , 1996 ; Moreau et al . , 1996 ; Mullins et al . , 1997 ; Welch et al . , 1997b ; Winter et al . , 1997 ) . Analysis of yeast mutations shed light on their roles in the cortical cytoskeleton . Delocalization of actin patches and a slight accumulation of membranous vesicles resulted from a tem - perature - sensitive ( ts ) mutation in S . cerevisiae Arp2p ( Mo - reau et al . , 1996 ) . This mutant was defective for dye uptake and for internalization of a membrane transporter , uracil permease ( Moreau et al . , 1997 ) . A ﬁssion yeast cold - sensitive ARP3 mutation caused disorganization of actin patches and defects in polarized growth ( McCollum et al . , 1996 ) . A ts mutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Arp3p impaired actin patch motility and caused accumulation of actin aggregates in the bud ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) . Arp2p and Arp3p were ﬁrst isolated by puriﬁcation of a proﬁlin - binding complex from Acanthamoeba , which contained ﬁve additional peptides , p40 , p35 , p19 , p18 , and p14 ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ) . A ho - mologous complex , puriﬁed from human platelets , localized at the leading edge of moving lamellipodia ( Welch et al . , 1997b ) . Puriﬁcation of the Arp2 / 3 complex from S . cerevisiae ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) showed that it was homologous to the Acanthamoeba and human complexes with the exception that one subunit , p40 or Sop2p ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1996 ) , did not copurify ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) . Structural modeling of Arp2p and Arp3p led to the hy - pothesis that Arp2p and Arp3p formed a heterodimer capa - ble of nucleating actin polymerization at the pointed end of actin ﬁlaments ( Kelleher et al . , 1995 ) , whereas electronic microscopy of puriﬁed Acanthamoeba Arp2 / 3 complex showed the complex bound to the sides of actin ﬁlaments in Present Addresses : † Atomic Energy Commission , Department of Molecular Biology , P .

Arp2 / 3 complex promotes actin polymerization at the surface of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes by recruiting host proteins through a surface protein , ActA ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) . The complex then nucleates actin ﬁlaments , generating propulsive force . How - ever , Arp2 / 3 complex is also localized all along actin tails of moving bacteria and not just at actin polymerization sites on the Listeria cell surface ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) . Recent evidence indicated that the Arp2 / 3 complex alone was a weak nucle - ator , whereas ActA alone was not . Their combined action had a dramatic synergistic effect on nucleation of actin ﬁla - ments ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) . Localization , nucleation , and cross - linking studies in Acanthamoeba have led to the prop - osition that the Arp2 / 3 complex promotes polymerization at the leading edge of membranes by attaching newly formed ﬁlaments to preexisting structures . Thus , as actin ﬁlaments grow at their membrane - proximal ends to drive motility , the bound Arp2 / 3 complex would be translocated away from the membrane ( Mullins et al . , 1998b ) . More recently , in ad - dition to nucleating actin at the barbed end of ﬁlaments , the Arp2 / 3 complex was shown to have high - afﬁnity pointed end capping activity to induce branched networks of ﬁla - ments in vitro ( Mullins et al . , 1998a ) . A novel yeast protein , Las17p / Bee1p , was shown to be a component of actin patches . Yeast cells deleted for the Wis - kott – Aldrich Syndrome protein ( WASP ) homologue concen - trated aberrant actin aggregates in the bud and were defec - tive in actin patch assembly , budding , and cytokinesis ( Li , 1997 ) . Moreover , biochemical studies using permeabilized cells and rhodamine - labeled actin suggested that Las17p / Bee1p was required for actin polymerization and assembly in vitro ( Lechler and Li , 1997 ) . Las17p is proline - rich and shows homology to human WASP , mutations in which cause severe immunodeﬁciency ( Amman and Hong , 1989 ) . WAS patients show cytoskeletal abnormalities of lympho - cytes and platelets ( Molina et al . , 1992 ) , failure of B cells to respond to polysaccharide antigens , and defective chemo - taxis in neutrophils ( Ochs et al . , 1980 ) , suggesting that WASP is important in cytoskeletal reorganization necessary for the immunological response . WASP colocalized with polymer - ized actin in human cells and bound speciﬁcally to activated CDC42Hs ( Apenstro¨m et al . , 1996 ; Kolluri et al . , 1996 ; Sy - mons et al . , 1996 ) . A more ubiquitously expressed homo - logue , N - WASP , was shown to bind actin , calmodulin , and Ash / Grb2p ( abundant Src homology / growth factor recep - tor - bound protein 2 ) , an Src homology 2 / Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain protein implicated in signal transduction from membrane receptors to effectors of the cytoskeleton ( Miki et al . , 1996 ) . Overexpression of either WASP or N - WASP in mammalian cells induced formation of actin clus - ters that colocalized with the overexpressed protein , indicat - ing a role in actin polymerization ( Miki et al . , 1996 ; Symons et al . , 1996 ) . The vertebrate WASP family member Scar1 / WAVE , like yeast Las17p , does not contain a recognizable GTPase binding site , but overexpression induced clustered actin ﬁlaments , demonstrating its involvement in actin reor - ganization ( Miki et al . , 1998 ) . WASP and Scar1 have now been shown to interact with actin via their WASP homology 2 ( WH2 ) domains and with the p21 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex via their C - terminal acidic domains . Overexpres - sion of these C - terminal acidic fragments caused delocaliza - tion of the Arp2 / 3 complex with concomitant loss of actin spots and lamellipodia ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) . We previously showed that in yeast , increased LAS17 expression suppressed arp2 - 1 growth thermosensitivity ( Madania et al . , 1997 ) . Here we present genetic , cellular , and biochemical evidence that Las17p functions with the Arp2 / 3 complex and raise the possibility that Las17p may be part of signaling pathways directed to the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin . MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids , Strains , Gene Banks , and Genetic Manipulations Plasmids and yeast strains used in this study are listed in Tables 1 and 2 . Strains are derived from YPH and FY strains , which are S288C derivatives . Genomic DNA banks used were constructed in 2 m plasmids : Sau3A - derived fragments in pFL44 vector ( from F . Lacroute ) , pGAD vector ( from P . Bartel ) ( Fields and Song , 1989 ) , multiple enzyme - derived fragments in pGAD424 ( from P . James ) ( James et al . , 1996 ) , or mechanically derived fragments cloned in pACTII ( from P . Legrain ) ( Fromont - Racine et al . , 1997 ) . The cDNA library used in two - hybrid screening was in pGAD - GH ( from M . White ) . DNA manipulations were carried out by standard tech - niques ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ) . Yeast cell cultures and genetic ma - nipulations were carried out essentially as described in by Guthrie and Fink ( 1991 ) . Yeast cells were transformed by the LiAc method using single - stranded carrier DNA and DMSO ( Schiestl and Gietz , 1989 ; Hill et al . , 1991 ) . LAS17 Gene Deletion Using PCR targeting with short ﬂanking homology ( Wach et al . , 1994 ) the complete LAS17 coding region was deleted in three dif - ferent diploid yeast strains : YPH501 , FY1679 , and W303 ( Table 2 ) . Oligonucleotides used to amplify the kanMX4 fragment on pFA6a - kanMX4 were 5 9 - AATTACAGTTCGTTACTTTAAGTGTTGATAG - GCGTGATTTAATGCTGCAGGTCGACGGATC - 3 9 and 5 9 - ACATA - TTTTCTATAACAGTAGTTTCATCTTTGTTTGCATTCCATCGAT - GAATTCGAGCTC - 3 9 . Recombinants bearing the kanMX4 marker were selected on YPD plates containing G418 at 200 m g / ml . Correct integration of the kanMX4 cassette was veriﬁed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA . Haploid las17 D strains ( YMW17K1 and YMW17K2 ) were obtained by sporulation and dissection of heterozygous dip - loid disruptants ; they appeared fully rescued at 37°C by plasmid - borne wild - type LAS17 . The same methodology and oligonucleo - tides allowed us to create las17 D : : HIS3 strains using plasmid pFA6a - HIS3MX6 as template . FDW174H is the resulting las17 D : : HIS3 diploid strain . Chromosomal Integration of Tagged ARP2 and ARP3 ts Alleles Seven ARP2 ( arp2 - 1 to arp2 - 7 ) ts mutations , initially obtained by PCR mutagenesis on plasmid pYCW207 ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ) , were integrated at the ARP2 locus . The ARP2 gene was tagged with URA3 by cloning an Xba I – Pvu II fragment containing the URA3 gene from pJJ244 ( Jones and Prakash , 1990 ) blunt into the Ssp I site 130 bp downstream of the ARP2 stop codon in plasmid pBES18 ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ) . This gave rise to pIMW18 - U . Mutant alleles ( arp2 - 1 to arp2 - 7 ) were exised as 1 . 38 - kb Sac I – Ssp I fragments from the mutant bank in pYCW207 , puriﬁed , and ligated into the Sac I – Sal I ( blunted ) sites of pBMW18 - U . Wild - type and resulting mutant plasmids were digested with Sac I – Kpn I , and the 3 . 4 - kb fragments containing the ARP2 ts alleles with the downstream URA3 marker were puriﬁed , transformed into YPH499 , and selected on SC 2 Ura . Ura 1 clones were tested for thermosensitive growth then for correct integration A . Madania et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3522 of the URA3 cassette at the ARP2 locus by PCR analysis of genomic DNA ( our unpublished results ) . Haploid - tagged wild - type and mu - tants were mated with YPH500 , and diploids were sporulated . In all 20 tetrads dissected for each cross , two ts URA3 and two non - ts ura3 spores were obtained ( Table 2 , YMW201U and YMW211U – YMW271U ) . In a similar manner , wild - type ARP3 and the arp3 - 14 mutant allele were tagged with the LEU2 gene ( Madania , 1998 ) . Construction of GFP Fusions with LAS17 , ARP2 , and ARP3 Stop codons of the LAS17 , ARP2 , and ARP3 genes were replaced with the coding sequence of green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) by short ﬂanking homology PCR targeting using the kanMX6 marker ( Wach et al . , 1994 ) . For LAS17 : GFP , pFA6a - GFPS65TkanMX6 was used as template to amplify a 2 . 5 - kb PCR fragment with oligonu - cleotides 5 9 - TAAAGTGGGAGCTCATGACGATATGGACAATGG - TGATGATTGGGCAGCGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAACTTT - 3 9 and 5 9 - ACATATTTTCTATAACAGTAGTTTCATCTTTGTTTGCATTCCA - TCGATGAATTCGAGCTC - 3 9 as primers . This fragment was trans - formed into diploid FY1679 , and G418 - resistant recombinants were veriﬁed for correct integration by PCR across both borders . Sporulation and dissection of a heterozygous G418 - resistant diploid revealed a 2 : 2 segregation of the kanMX6 marker , which coincided with GFP ﬂuo - rescence . Strain FMW173GK ( homozygous for LAS17 : GFP ) was con - structed by mating a and a spores . For GFP fusion with ARP2 , the pFA6a - GFPS65TkanMX6 plasmid was modiﬁed to add a 5 3 glycine - alanine linker following the ORF and then used as template to amplify a 2 . 5 - kb PCR fragment with oligonucleotides 5 9 - TGGCAAGAAAGCGGGCCATCTGCAATGA - CTAAATTTGGTCCAAGAGGATCCGGAGCAGGTGCT - 3 9 and 5 9 - TCCATTTCCATTTTTCATTCGTAGATTTAAACTTTTTTATTAAT - TCTTTTGTCGATGAATTCGAGCTCGTTT - 3 9 as primers . A ARP2 : GFP haploid strain was constructed and veriﬁed as above , and then a spores were mated to make strain FDW23GK . Growth of these strains was slow and temperature sensitive . To obtain ARP2 strains with these fusion proteins that grew better , the GFP of modiﬁed pFA6a - GFPS65TkanMX6 plasmid was converted to yEGFP ( Cor - mack et al . , 1997 ) and integrated into one allele of the diploid las17 D strain , FDW174H , to create strain FDW180HK . Similarly , to make a functional GFP fusion with ARP3 , the stop codon of one allele of the ARP3 gene was replaced by yEGFP using oligonucleotides 5 - TATGGTCCGGAAATTGTTAGAAATTTCAG - CCTTTTCAACATGGTTGGATCCGGAGCAGGTGCT - 3 9 ( ARP3 in frame with GAGAGAGAGA : EGFP ) and 5 9 - AGGGGCGTTTCAGT - TATTTGCATTTGTTTTTGTACCTTTTTCCTTATAAGATCGATG - AATTCGAGCTGCTTT - 3 9 as primers , and the resulting fragment was transformed into strain FY1679 to create strain FDW34GK and into FDW174H to create strain FDW190HK . Cell Fixation , Phalloidin and Antibody Staining , and GFP Observation Early log phase cells were ﬁxed and stained as previously described ( Pringle et al . , 1991 ) , except that incubation with phalloidin was for 1 h with shaking at 4°C in the dark using 1 m M TRITC - labeled phalloidin ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) or 1 m M Alexa - 594 phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) . Fixed cells were sometimes kept at 4°C for a maximum of 3 d before staining . For GFP observation , ﬁxation time was reduced to 15 min . For in vivo observations of GFP fusion proteins , cells were grown in liquid YPD at 25°C to early log phase and then harvested , resuspended in 1 M sorbitol , and imme - diately observated using a GFP bandpass ﬁlter ( excitation , 460 – 500 ; dichroic mirror , 505 ; emission , 510 – 560 ) . Antibody staining of spheroplasts was as previously described ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ) with C4 monoclonal mouse immunoglobuliln G1 ( IgG1 ) anti - actin anti - body ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) and polyclonal rabbit anti - GFP antibody ( a gift from K . Sawin , London , United Kingdom ) . Preparations were analyzed and photographed using an Optiphot - 2 microscope ( Nikon , Melville , NY ) equipped with ﬂuo - rescent optics . Photographs were taken using 400ASA ﬁlm and then scanned ( 300 dots per inch ﬁnal resolution ) or direct acquisitions were made with a Photonics ( Milpitas , CA ) Science charge - coupled device Coolview camera equipped with the Gel Grab 2 . 02 software program .

Legrain Froment - Racine et al . ( 1997 ) YMW strains and the RH strain are isogenic derivatives of YPH strains . Strain names beginning with F are isogenic FY1679 derivatives . Both of these series of strains are derivatives of S288C . A . Madania et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3524 branes was as described by Vida and Emr ( 1995 ) . 35 S - Alpha factor uptake assays were performed as described ( Dulic et al . , 1991 ) . All strains were preincubated at 37°C for 15 min before the addition of alpha factor . The samples were processed as described above . All uptake assays were performed twice . Immunoprecipitation of Las17p and Arp2p To tag Las17p with protein A , the stop codon of the LAS17 gene was replaced by the coding frame of the IgG binding domain of protein A using the kanMX6 selection marker as a PCR - synthesized frag - ment with short ﬂanking homology on either side of the LAS17 stop codon . pYM7 was the template source of protein A ( Knop et al . , 1999 ) , ampliﬁed with the same primers as for the LAS17 : GFP fusion . The resulting 2 . 1 - kb PCR fragment was transformed into the diploid strain FY1679 , which was sporulated . G418 - resistant progeny were veriﬁed for correct tag insertion by PCR . One of these haploids was crossed with a haploid arp2 D rescued by hemagglutinin ( HA ) - tagged Arp2p ( YMW15 1 pYEW250 ) ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ) , and a recombinant haploid derivative was selected ( strain YMW175K ) . Whole - cell extracts were made by the liquid nitrogen grinding in 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM KCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 buffer ( Li , 1997 ) and resuspended at 10 mg / ml after clariﬁcation by 30 min of centrifugation at 20 , 000 3 g . Eighty microliters of Las17 - prot A extract and nontagged extract were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 40 m l of IgG - Sepharose ( 6 Fast Flow ; Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) suspension . Immunoprecipitation and washes were with starting buffer . Eluted proteins were precipitated with 10 % trichloroacteic acid and resuspended in loading buffer . Samples were separated by 10 % PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose . Blots were incubated with appropriate primary and secondary an - tibodies and then developped with a Super Signal ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) chemiluminescent kit for HRP . IgG to reveal Las17 - prot A was puriﬁed from nonimmunized rabbit serum by passage over a protein A - Sepharose column ( Phar - macia CL - 4B ) . Production and characterization of anti - Arp2p anti - bodies has been previously described ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ) . Construction of GAL4 Fusion Plasmids for Two - Hybrid Interactions LAS17 was ampliﬁed with oligonucleotides 5 9 - GGCGTGATTTAC - CATGGGACTCC - 3 9 ( with an Nco I site at the ATG of LAS17 ) and 5 9 - CATCTTCTCGAGCATTCCATTACCAA - 3 9 ( with an Xho I site just after the stop codon ) using pAMW171 as template . A 1 . 9 - kb Nco I – Xho I PCR fragment was cloned into the Nco I – Sal I sites of pAS2 in fusion with GAL4 binding domain ( GAL4BD ) to give pBMW172 and into the Nco I – Xho I sites of pACTII in fusion with GAL4 activa - tion domain ( GAL4AD ) to give pAMW173 . Both pBMW172 and pAMW173 were able to rescue YMW171K ( las17 D ) at 25 and 37°C ( our unpublished data ) . All GAL4 fusions constructed were system - atically controlled by sequencing the fusion site . Two - hybrid GAL4AD constructions coding for wild - type Cdc42p and its acti - vated form ( Cdc42p G12V ) were kindly provided by E . Leberer ( Le - berer et al . , 1997 ) and by the Pringle laboratory ( Cvrckova et al . , 1995 ) . Two - Hybrid Screens with LAS17 as Bait cDNA Screen . Y190 strain ( Durfee et al . , 1993 ) containing pBMW172 ( GAL4BD - LAS17 ) was transformed with a yeast cDNA library in pGAD - GH ( kindly provided by Michael White , University of Texas Southwestern Medical School , Dallas , TX ) and plated on SC 2 Trp , Leu , and His supplemented with 35 mM 3 - aminotriazole ( 3 - AT ) . After incubation for 1 wk at 30°C , 309 colonies among 200 , 000 initial transformants were patched onto SC 2 Trp , Leu , and His 35 mM 3 - AT plates and allowed to grow at 30°C for 2 d . These clones were then tested in a 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl - b - d - galactopyranoside ( X - Gal ) ﬁlter assay , and clones that turned blue were further ana - lyzed . Plasmids were rescued and reintroduced into Y190 and Y190 containing pBMW172 and tested in the X - Gal colony ﬁlter assay . One hundred sixty plasmids giving a signal with pBMW172 were sequenced with oligonucleotides 5 9 - GGAATCACTACAGGGAT - G - 3 9 to control in - frame fusions and with 5 9 - GAAGTGAACTT - GCGGGG - 3 9 to determine the size of the fused protein . After elim - ination of redundant fusions , 23 different positive clones representing 10 different genes were identiﬁed and tested in b - ga - lactosidase liquid culture assays . Genomic DNA Screen . Yeast strain Y187 was transformed by stan - dard procedures with DNA ampliﬁed from an aliquot of the FRYL library ( Fromont - Racine et al . , 1997 ) . Ten million yeast transfor - mants were collected and pooled , and aliquots were stored at 2 80°C . To screen by mating , a tube containing 10 7 transformants was equilibrated in fresh YPD then mixed with 2 3 10 7 log phase CG1945 cells previously transformed with plasmid pBMW172 ( G AL4BD - LAS17 ) and incubated for 6 h . Cells representing 1 . 15 3 10 6 diploids were plated on SC 2 Trp , Leu , and His supplemented with 35 mM 3 - AT and incubated at 30°C for 7 d . The clones thus obtained were assayed as described above then recycled , and plas - mids were extracted and sequenced . X - Gal Colony Filter Assay and b - Galactosidase Assay b - Galactosidase activity of simple or double transformants of Y190 was assessed on nitrocellulose ﬁlters as described by Breeden and Nasmyth ( 1985 ) . To quantitate b - galactosidase activity , freshly streaked Y190 double transformants were inoculated into 2 . 5 ml of liquid SC 2 Trp and Leu and allowed to grow overnight to OD 600 nm of ; 1 . b - Galactosidase activity was measured and expressed in Miller units ( Kandels - Lewis and Seraphin , 1993 ) . RESULTS LAS17 Is an Allele - speciﬁc Multicopy Suppressor of ARP2 ts Mutations To identify proteins that interact with Arp2p , we screened yeast multicopy genomic libraries for clones whose expres - sion was able to rescue the temperature sensitivity of the arp2 - 1 mutation in strain YMW81 . In a preliminary screen using the Lacroute genomic bank we obtained several clones , the smallest of which contained a plasmid , pYEW170 , with an insert of 4 kb covering several genes . Using the Fields and Bartel YL1 / 2 / 3 genomic bank , 24 plasmids were able to support growth at 37°C . Besides the ARP2 gene , seven groups of inserts were identiﬁed . Se - quencing of insert borders revealed that all seven clones contained a full - length LAS17 coding sequence . Because the inserts of the two shortest clones did not overlap any adja - cent coding regions , we concluded that LAS17 was respon - sible for suppression . Suppression of previously isolated ts mutations arp2 - 1 to arp2 - 7 ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ) was tested to ﬁnd out whether LAS17 suppression was allele speciﬁc . Sequence changes in the ARP2 gene were determined and are shown in Table 2 . WT and mutant fragments tagged with the URA3 gene were integrated into strain YPH499 at the ARP2 locus ( see MA - TERIALS AND METHODS ) , giving rise to strains YMW211U to YMW271U . We have previously shown that the arp2 - 1 ts mutation causes delocalization of polarized cortical actin patches at 37°C ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ) . When strains YMW221U to YMW271U were stained with phalloi - din , actin distribution appeared normal in most cells of Las17p Interacts with the Arp2 / 3 Complex Vol . 10 , October 1999 3525 arp2 - 2 , arp2 - 4 , arp2 - 5 , and arp2 - 7 at 25°C , whereas arp2 - 3 and arp2 - 6 cells showed loss of actin organization at this temper - ature ( Figure 1A ) . All mutants had lost the polarized distri - bution of actin patches after 2 h at the restrictive tempera - ture . Actin clumps or aggregates in the bud or at the mother – daughter neck and an enlarged bud neck were ob - served in budding cells of each of the ts mutants . Surpris - ingly , none of these mutant actin phenotypes was qualita - tively different from those observed for the original arp2 - 1 mutant . A similar ts phenotype also resulted from fusion of green ﬂuorescent protein to the carboxyl terminus of the ARP2 coding sequence ( see MATERIALS AND METHODS ) . Figure 1 . Actin phenotypes of ARP2 ts mutants .

Cells were grown to early log phase in complete medium at 25°C . Part of the culture was shifted to 37°C for 2 h . ( B ) Strain FDW23GK ( a / a ) containing an ARP2 : GFP C - terminal fusion . Cells were treated as in A and then ﬁxed and stained with TRITC - phalloidin as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . The left panels were photographed with a GFP bandpass ﬁlter , and the right panels were photographed with a rhodamine ﬁlter . Bar , 5 m m . A . Madania et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3526 Examination of the ARP2 - GFP strain did not reveal any Arp2 - gfp ﬂuorescence in the many phalloidin - staining actin aggregates present in buds or in mother – bud necks , whereas both actin and Arp2p were present in the remain - ing nonpolarized patches ( Figure 1B ) . These ARP2 mutants were used to test allele speciﬁcity of LAS17 suppression . When ARP2 strains were transformed by a multicopy LAS17 plasmid , pAMW171 , the arp2 - 2 mu - tant as well as the arp2 - 1 mutant initially used in the selec - tion were rescued at 37°C . The thermosensitivity of the other mutants was not relieved ( Figure 2 ) . This clearly shows that suppression is speciﬁc to certain point mutations and sug - gests that a speciﬁc interaction could be involved . Major mutant phenotypes such as disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and deﬁcient endocytosis were examined in LAS17 - suppressed strains YMW211U , YMW221U , and YMW241U . LAS17 overexpression suppressed actin cy - toskeleton defects in the arp2 - 1 mutant and partially sup - pressed defects of the arp2 - 2 mutant at 37°C , in good corre - spondence with growth recovery . Figure 3A shows that even partial suppression in the arp2 - 2 mutant is clearly visible ; the majority of arp2 - 2 ts cells containing overex - pressed LAS17 no longer showed aberrant clumped actin in the bud at 37°C ( Figure 3A , b , lower panel ) . Actin patches were less concentrated in the buds than in rescued cells ( Figure 3A , c , lower panel ) . Suppression of endocytosis as judged by the ability of cells to take up and deliver the ﬂuorescent neutral dye Lucifer yellow - carbohydrazine to the vacuole by ﬂuid phase endocytosis ( Riezman , 1985 ) fol - lowed the same pattern of allele speciﬁcity as growth and actin defects . Even at permissive growth temperature after extended times ( 60 min here vs . 10 min normally ) , uptake was inhibited in the arp2 - 2 mutant ( Figure 3B , a , compared with the rescued mutant , c ) . The LAS17 overexpression al - lowed LY uptake and accumulation in the vacuole in the arp2 - 2 mutant ( Figure 3B , b ) although slightly less efﬁciently than for the arp2 - 1 allele ( our unpublished data ) . Investiga - tion of the arp2 - 4 allele revealed that the mutant was also endocytosis deﬁcient but that LAS17 overexpression did not rescue this deﬁciency . LAS17 Overexpression Can Also Rescue Conditional Mutations in the ARP3 Gene Because Arp2p and Arp3p are part of the same macromo - lecular complex ( Machesky et al . , 1994 ; Welch et al . , 1997b ; Winter et al . , 1997 ) , we questioned whether LAS17 overex - pression would also suppress the phenotype of ARP3 con - ditional mutations . We have isolated recessive ARP3 ts al - leles on plasmids in an arp3 D strain ( Madania , 1998 ) . The capacity of LAS17 overexpression to rescue growth at non - permissive temperatures for six different mutants , arp3 - 9 to arp3 - 14 , was tested . Only one ts mutant , arp3 - 9 , was well suppressed at 37°C . At 36°C LAS17 overexpression allowed good growth of arp3 - 9 , arp3 - 10 , and arp3 - 13 mutants and some growth of arp3 - 12 mutant , whereas growth of arp3 - 11 and arp3 - 14 mutants was not rescued ( Figure 4 ) . Thus , LAS17 is also an allele - speciﬁc suppressor of ARP3 mutants indi - cating that Las17p interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex is important for at least one essential function . Synthetic Enhancement of LAS17 Deletion with ARP2 and ARP3 Mutants To gain further information on Las17p interactions with Arp2p and Arp3p , we looked for synthetic enhancement between las17 D and ARP2 or ARP3 mutants . The las17 D strain YMW172K was crossed with seven URA3 - tagged ARP2 and one LEU2 - tagged ARP3 integrated mutants ( see MATERIALS AND METHODS ) . Viable haploid spores after meiosis were tested for G418 resistance ( kanMX4 marker for las17 D ) and for uracil and leucine prototrophy ( Table 3 ) . As demonstrated by the absence of viable double mutants , six of seven different ARP2 ts mutants , arp2 - 1 , arp2 - 2 , arp2 - 3 , arp2 - 4 , arp2 - 5 , and arp2 - 6 , are lethal in the absence of LAS17 . Analysis of a cross between strain YMW321L bearing arp3 - 14 : LEU2 and strain YMW171K bearing las17 D revealed no viable kanR Leu 1 spores ( Table 3 ) . These synthetic lethality results between las17 D and ARP2 and ARP3 ts mutants conﬁrmed the importance of Las17p in the vital functions of Arp2p and Arp3p , prompting us to further investigate the cellular functions and interactions of Las17p . Figure 2 . LAS17 overexpression suppresses certain ARP2 ts mutants . Seven ARP2 ts strains ( arp2 - 1 to 2 - 7 / YMW211U – YMW271U ) and wild - type ( YMW201U ) described in Table 2 were transformed with pGAD ( vector ) ( A ) , pAMW171 ( LAS17 in pGAD ) ( B ) , and pAMW200 ( ARP2 in pGAD ) ( C ) . Transformants were streaked on SC 2 Ura and Leu plates and incubated at 37°C for 4 d . Note that the arp2 - 5 ts mutant grows at 37°C on minimal medium but is more ts on complete medium .

Strain YMW221U ( bearing the arp2 - 2 : URA3 ts allele ) was transformed with vector ( a ) , with pAMW171 ( LAS17 2 m ) ( b ) , and with pAMW200 ( ARP2 in pGAD ) ( c ) . ( A ) Transformants were grown at 25°C in liquid YPD to log phase and shifted to 37°C for 2 h .

( B ) Transformants were grown in liquid YPD at 25°C to log phase and incubated for 1 h with LY as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . Cells were photographed using an FITC ﬁlter ( LY ) or Nomarski optics ( differential interference contrast [ DIC ] ) . A . Madania et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3528 Phenotypes of las17 D Mutant Cells Deletion of LAS17 in the S288C strain background has been reported to cause temperature - sensitive growth , budding , and cytokinesis defects with aberrant actin bundles and lack of patches in the buds ( Li , 1997 ) . las17 D cells showed mis - shapen unpinched bud necks and actin cortical patch defects as described ( Li , 1997 ) , except that actin - containing patches were visible in both the bud and the mother cell , as has been since reported ( Karpova et al . , 1998 ) . We found that deletion of LAS17 results in lethality or temperature sensitivity , de - pending on the strain background . The phenotype was more severe in the W303 background than in the YPH or FY1679 background . Testing of las17 D ts cells in the presence of osmoregulators showed that they were acutely osmosensi - tive . Growth was completely inhibited at 25°C with 0 . 30 M NaCl or 1 . 8 M sorbitol added to complete medium . Because LAS17 overexpression suppressed defective en - docytosis in certain ARP2 and ARP3 mutants , we also inves - tigated endocytosis in las17 D cells using a variety of meth - ods . Three different reporter systems were used to reveal different aspects of endocytosis ; LY for ﬂuid phase endocy - tosis , the lipophilic vital stain FM4 - 64 to follow membrane internalization ( Vida and Emr , 1995 ) , and a - factor phero - mone uptake to follow ligand - dependent receptor - mediated ( Ste2p ) endocytosis ( Singer and Riezman , 1990 ; Riezman , 1993 ) . Naqvi et al . ( 1998 ) have recently reported deﬁcient LY endocytosis by las17 D cells . Our independent results showed severe deﬁciency at the permisive growth temperature with no visible accumulation in the vacuole . We also examined strain YMW171K after incubation with FM4 - 64 to follow the intracellular fate of the dye . Very little dye was taken up by mutant relative to wild - type cells ( Figure 5A ) . Nevertheless , trafﬁcking through membrane compartments without accu - mulation in intermediary ( endosomal ) structures in addition to accumulation of weak ﬂuorescence in membranes around the vacuole suggests that the dye progressed to its normal destination . Thus , the pathway from the plasma membrane to the vacuole appears to function normally . Pheromone recognition and receptor internalization are the ﬁrst steps in receptor - mediated endocytosis . The ability of cells to bind and internalize a - factor is constant through - out the cell cycle , allowing measurement of ligand - depen - dent internalization of the Ste2p receptor in growing cells ( Zanolari and Riezman , 1991 ) . To increase sensitivity to a - factor , strain YMW171K and its parent were ﬁrst dis - rupted for the BAR1 gene ( MacKay et al . , 1988 ) . Radioactive uptake of biosynthetically labeled a - factor across the plasma membrane was then quantiﬁed . Figure 5B shows that in cells grown at 24°C , tested before and after shift up to 37°C , a - factor binds to las17 D cells . However , receptor - mediated endocytosis is severely deﬁcient at 24°C , and uptake is in - distinguishable from background at 37°C . Taken together Figure 4 . LAS17 allele - speciﬁc suppression of ARP3 ts mutants . The arp3 D ( YMW301T ) strain rescued by ﬁve different ARP3 ts alleles ( arp3 - 9 to arp3 - 13 and ARP3 ) and strain YMW321L ( bearing the arp3 - 14 : LEU2 allele ) were transformed by vector ( a ) , pYEW170 ( LAS17 , 2 m ) ( b ) , or pCMW304 rescue plasmid ( ARP3 : LEU2 ) ( c ) . Freshly cultured transformants were spotted onto YNB 2 Leu and Ura plates , which were incubated at 25°C for 5 d or at 36°C for 3 d before being photographed . Table 3 .

Strain YMW172K ( MAT a las17 D < kanMX4 ) was crossed with strains YMW311L ( MATa ARP3 ; LEU2 ) and YMW321L ( MATa arp3 - 14 ; LEU2 ) . Diploids were sporulated , tetrads were dissected , and viable spores were tested for G418 resistance and for growth on SC 2 Ura at 25°C . The genotype of dead spores was inferred from that of viable spores in each tetrad tested . For each cross the number of tetrads was analyzed , and the number of double mutants and the number of viable and dead spores among these double mutants is indicated . Las17p Interacts with the Arp2 / 3 Complex Vol . 10 , October 1999 3529 these results allow us to conclude that Las17p is essential for the internalization step of endocytosis . Las17p Is Also a Determinant for Polarity Development The actin cytoskeleton is required for the diploid - speciﬁc bipolar budding pattern normally seen in wild - type cells , and mutations in a number of cortical patch components affect this pattern ( Rodriguez and Paterson , 1990 ; Sivadon et al . , 1995 ; Vaduva et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1997 ) . When the bipolar budding pattern was examined , most las17 D diploid cells had randomly located bud scars , whereas wild - type cells showed a normal bipolar budding pattern ( Figure 6 ) . Thus , the choice of the bud site , an initial step in the deter - mination of a growth polarity , appears to be the primary defect rather than bud emergence or growth . Las17 - gfp Localizes to Cortical Patches Independently of Polymerized Actin Las17p has been shown to coprecipitate with G - actin and is important for in vitro reconstitution of cortical actin assem - bly sites ( Lechler and Li , 1997 ; Li , 1997 ) . To visualize Las17p in living cells , an in situ fusion with GFP was constructed to replace LAS17 ( see MATERIALS AND METHODS ) . LAS17 : GFP spores grew well at all temperatures , conﬁrming func - tionality . GFP ﬂuorescence in strain FMW17GK localized in cortical patch structures concentrated at sites of bud emer - gence , in small buds and at the bud neck before cytokinesis . When LAS17 : GFP cells were ﬁxed and stained with phalloi - din , actin and Las17 - gfp patches colocalized ( control cells ; Figure 7 ) . This in vivo colocalization conﬁrms that estab - lished using an overexpressed Myc - tagged Las17 / Bee1p ( Li , 1997 ) . We then examined the consequences of disrupting the ( polymerized ) actin cytoskeleton with latrunculin - A on Las17p localization . The drug latrunculin - A binds G - actin ( Coue´ et al . , 1987 ) and has been shown to rapidly disrupt the yeast actin cytoskeleton by inhibiting actin ﬁlament assem - bly ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . FMW17GK cells expressing Las17 - gfp were treated for 5 , 15 , or 30 min with 100 m M latrunculin - A and then brieﬂy ﬁxed , washed , and stained with phalloidin . Actin ﬁlaments were no longer detectable by the 5 min time point , whereas Las17 - gfp remained local - ized in cortical patch - like structures at presumtive bud sites , Figure 5 . Endocytosis defects in las17 D cells . ( A ) FM4 - 64 uptake by las17 D cells . YMW171K ( las17 D ) and YPH499 ( WT ) cells were grown to log phase in liquid YPD at 25°C and then concentrated and incubated for 15 min in 20 m M FM4 - 64 followed by a 45 - min chase in fresh YPD .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 3530 in small buds , and at the mother – daughter bud neck of dividing cells . This localization remained up to 30 min after latrunculin - A treatment ( Figure 7A ) , although cells were slightly larger and more rounded than at the 5 - min time point , indicating anisotropic cell growth . Las17p localization is thus maintained in the absence of actin cytoskeletal struc - tures needed for polarized growth . Because Las17p might bind actin monomers or dimers not revealed by phalloidin staining , we also examined latrunculin - A - treated cells using anti - actin antibodies . After 30 min of latrunculin - A treat - ment , control cells ( Figure 7B , upper panels ) showed normal polarized distribution of both actin and Las17 - gfp . How - ever , no concentration of actin was detected in patch struc - tures , whereas anti - GFP antibodies clearly revealed Las17 - gfp concentrated in polarized patches ( Figure 7B , lower panels ) in the majority of cells . Las17p Is Necessary for the Polarized Localization of Arp2p and Arp3p We then addressed the question of whether Las17p was necessary for polarized localization of Arp2p and Arp3p . Because Arp2 - gfp and Arp3 - gfp fusion proteins as unique source of Arp caused ts growth in haploids ( our unpub - lished observations ) , we tagged one allele in a diploid strain to render these fusion proteins functional . ARP2 : EGFP and ARP : EGFP were integrated on one allele of a las17 D / las17 D strain ( FDW174H ) giving rise to strains FDW180HK and FDW190HK , respectively . Diploid strains were no longer ts , and both Arp2 - egfp ( Figure 8A , strain FDW24GK ) and Arp3 - egfp ( Figure 8B , strain FDW34GK ) were localized in a polarized manner . In the absence of Las17p , Arp2 - egfp and Arp3 - egfp patches were clearly visible at the cortex ( Figure 8 , A and B , lower panels ) but were not organized in a polarized manner . This depolarization of Arp2p patches was also observed ( using Arp2p antibody ) after latrunculin - A treatment ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . Loss of patch organization indicates that Las17p is a necessary polarity determinant for the localization of the Arp2 / 3 complex as well as for actin patches as shown above . Does Las17p Interact Physically with the Arp2 / 3 Complex ? Because LAS17 showed genetic and functional interactions with ARP2 and ARP3 , we asked whether Las17p could interact directly with Arp2p and / or Arp3p using the two - hybrid system . Constructions are described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . Las17p bait showed activation with actin as expected , but signiﬁcant Las17p interaction was not de - tected with Arp2p or Arp3p fusions ( Table 4 ) . In light of speciﬁc genetic interactions between Las17p and Arp2p and Arp3p , we pursued the possibility of direct interaction be - tween Las17p and the Arp2 / 3 complex by immunoprecipi - tation of Las17p from crude extracts . The LAS17 gene was tagged in situ with a protein A - coding DNA fragment as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . This strain was then crossed to an arp2 D strain complemented by 3HAC 9 ARP2 on pYEW248 ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ) and recom - binant doubly tagged spores were selected , giving rise to strain YMW175K . To immunoprecipitate Las17p , protein A - Sepharose beads were incubated with IgG and then with whole cell extract from strain YMW175K as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . Las17 - prot A precipitated from the supernatant was visualized after SDS gel electrophoresis on blots with IgG ( Figure 9A ) . Arp2p clearly precipitated with Las17 - prot A after multiple washes ( Figure 9B ) . Neither Las17 - prot A nor Arp2p precipitated in a parallel control experiment from a nontagged wild - type extract ( Figure 9 , A and B , lane C ) . Analysis of the same fractions with speciﬁc anti - Arc35p / End9p antibodies ( Brodbeck - Scha¨rer , unpublished results ) conﬁrmed the presence of this Arp2 / 3 complex subunit in the immunoprecipitate with Arp2p . This result conﬁrms that Figure 7 . Functional Las17 - gfp remains localized independently of actin . ( A ) Localization of Las17p at 25°C after treatment of cells with latrunculin - A .

Spheroplasts were labeled with rabbit anti - GFP IgG ( left panels ) and mouse monoclonal anti - actin IgG ( right panels ) , which were revealed by goat anti - rabbit FITC and goat anti - mouse Cya - nine 3 secondary antibodies using appropriate ﬁlters . No overlap between ﬁlter channels was detected in control exposures . Las17p Interacts with the Arp2 / 3 Complex Vol . 10 , October 1999 3531 the genetic data presented above represents speciﬁc physical interaction between Las17p and the Arp2 / 3 complex . The human homologue of Las17p , WASP , regulates actin polymerization and cytoskeleton rearrangements and has been shown to interact directly with activated CDC42Hs ( Apenstro¨m et al . , 1996 ; Miki et al . , 1996 ; Symons et al . , 1996 ) . We were intrigued to know whether Las17p interacted di - rectly with Cdc42p in S . cerevisiae because the Cdc42p con - sensus binding sequence is absent . To test these interactions in the two - hybrid system , a Las17p bait was tested for interaction with wild - type and activated Cdc42p ( Cvrckova et al . , 1995 ; Leberer et al . , 1997 ) , in addition to proﬁlin and actin ( Amberg et al . , 1995 ) as known interactants . No signif - icant interactions with wild - type or activated Cdc42p were detected with these constructions . To learn more about the interactions of Las17p , we used the two - hybrid system to screen a yeast cDNA library and a genomic DNA library for potential Las17p interacting pro - teins ( see MATERIALS AND METHODS ) . In these screens ( neither of which represent saturation ) we found clones representing three known cytoskeletal proteins actin , ver - prolin , and Rvs167p ( reduced viability upon starvation ) , and six proteins of unknown function , named LSB for Las seventeen binding proteins : Lsb1p ( YGR136W ) , Lsb2p ( YPR154w ) , Lsb3p ( YFR024c - A ) , Lsb4p / Ysc84p ( YHR016c ) , Lsb5p ( YCL034w ) , and Lsb6p ( YJL100w ) .

Not all candidates found are shown ; interactions of the strongest and shortest fusions of each candidate are shown ; longest fusions for Rvs167p and Vrp1p are also shown . A . Madania et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3532 ing these fusions were puriﬁed and transformed into strain Y190 expressing either Gal4DB - Las17p ( pBMW172 ) or Gal4DB - Act1p ( pDAB7 ) . Results of b - galactosidase assays for the most informative in - phase clones are summarized in Table 4 . Of the known proteins found , a fusion containing actin with 27 additional aa at the amino terminus was found , similar to an extended actin ( pAIP70 ) found in a screen against actin itself ( Amberg et al . , 1995 ) . Las17p showed strong two - hybrid interaction with multiple derivatives of the SH3 domain protein Rvs167p . Nine different truncations ( from the cDNA library ) gave strong interaction with the Las17p bait . Rvs167p , originally identiﬁed along with Rvs161p as being important for recovery from starvation , affects cytoskeletal organization ( Bauer et al . , 1993 ; Sivadon et al . , 1995 ) . The smallest interacting fusion ( 83 aa ) contains only the SH3 domain plus 21 aa of the GPA ( for rich in Gly , Pro , and Ala ) domain , whereas the strongest interacting fusion ( 239 – 482 ) contains the SH3 domain plus the GPA domain . In addition , four more N - terminally extended clones , beginning at aa 220 , 191 , 183 , and 69 , showed inter - action with actin , as was reported by Amberg et al . ( pAIP38 aa 189 – 549 ) , whereas shorter clones did not . Strikingly , for verprolin ( Vrp1p / End5p ) , eight different genomic frag - ments ( and one cDNA fragment ) all contained the C - termi - nal extremity of the protein . The smallest fusion contained only the C - terminal 36 aa , and the strongest interacting fusion had 327 aa . These results “map” a major Las17p interaction with Vrp1p to the Vrp1p C - terminus . Among the unknown candidates , sequence comparisons revealed that Lsb1p , Lsb2p , Lsb3p , and Lsb4 / Ysc84 contain SH3 domains with high similarity to the SH3 domain of Rvs167p and to that of human Grb2p . Lsb1p / V25 ( 241 aa ) and Lsb2p ( 215 aa ) contain an N - terminal SH3 domain fol - lowed by a proline - rich acidic region . With 64 % identity to each other they form a strongly interacting minimal family . Except for the SH3 domain , no signiﬁcant homologies for Lsb1p / Lsb2p were detected with other proteins in data - bases . Lsb1p has been characterized in a comparative mRNA study as being highly expressed in high - density cultures and upon diauxic shift , but deletion of the gene showed no particular phenotype ( Wang et al . , 1997 ) . Lsb3p ( 451 aa ) and Ysc84p / Lsb4p ( 468 aa ) are 67 % identical to each other , forming another minimal family with a C - terminal SH3 domain . BLAST searches and sequence alignment re - vealed homology between these two proteins and an SH3 - domain containing protein of unknown function from mouse ( 340 aa , cDNA clone ge : D85926 ) . YSC84 / LSB4 was studied as an example of a divergently transcribed gene whose expression increased 5 - to 10 - fold during sporulation . However , its deletion caused no apparent phenotype for vegetative growth , progression into meiosis , or sporulation ( Rocco et al . , 1993 ) . These SH3 domain proteins are currently under investigation . Candidates Lsb5p and Lsb6p are un - known , but both have possible homologues in other organ - isms . Lsb5p ( 265 aa ) is similar to a hypothetical Schizosac - charomyces pombe protein . Lsb6p ( 607 aa ) is similar to a hypothetical Caenorhabditis elegans protein C56A3 . 8 . Al - though the existence of possible homologues in other species suggests that these ORFs code for functional proteins , the biological relevance to Las17p remains to be established . DISCUSSION LAS17 Is Important for the Function of the Arp2 / 3 Complex The phylogenetic conservation of the Arp2 / 3 complex and its localization to actin - rich cortical regions of cells suggest that it fulﬁlls a common essential function in the cortical actin cytoskeleton . The Arp2 / 3 complex functions to bind and cross - link actin ﬁlaments ( Mullins et al . , 1997 , 1998b ) and to nucleate actin polymerization required to produce movement at the cell surface ( Mullins et al . , 1998b ; Welch et al . , 1997a , 1998 ) . Las17p / Bee1p has been shown to be in - volved in the actin cytoskeleton ( Li , 1997 ) and in actin as - sembly in vitro ( Lechler and Li , 1997 ) . We addressed here the question of how Las17p produces its effects on actin organization . Our genetic evidence shows that Las17p plays an important role in the functioning of Arp2 and Arp3 proteins , thus linking it to the function ( s ) of the Arp2 / 3 complex . First , LAS17 is an allele - speciﬁc suppressor of the Figure 9 . Coimmunoprecipitation of Las17p and Arp2p ( Arp2 / 3 complex ) . Las17 - prot A was immunoprecipitated from crude extracts of strain YMW175K , which contained a chromosomally integrated allele of protein A - tagged Las17p and plasmid - borne HA tagged Arp2p ( described in MATERIALS AND METHODS ) . After precipitation with TCA , cell extract and each step of the immunoprecipitation were subjected to 10 % SDS - PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose . E , extract ; S , supernatant ; L1 , wash 1 ; L2 , wash 2 ; L3 , wash 3 ; P , immunoprecipitate ; C , control immunoprecipitate , mock IP from crude extract of the YMW175K parental strain without protein A tag . ( A ) Las17 - protA detected with puriﬁed rabbit IgG . ( B ) HA - tagged Arp2p detected with mouse monoclonal anti - HA IgG . Las17p Interacts with the Arp2 / 3 Complex Vol . 10 , October 1999 3533 temperature - sensitive growth of ARP2 and ARP3 mutants . Defects in polarity of actin distribution and in ﬂuid phase endocytosis were also suppressed . That is , no separation of function between actin defects and deﬁcient endocytosis was apparent . Second , synthetic lethality of las17 D with six of seven ARP2 mutants and with an ARP3 mutant indicates that these proteins affect the same cellular processes . Taken together , these results would tell us that Las17p plays an important role in the functions of the Arp2 / 3 complex but do not differentiate between stabilization of Arp2 / 3 complex interactions from regulation of actin - polymerizing function and / or signaling mechanisms mediated by Las17p . LAS17 D and ts Mutations in ARP2 and ARP3 Cause Similar Phenotypes Deletion of LAS17 perturbs the organization of the actin cytoskeleton at permissive growth temperature ( Li , 1997 ; this study ) and is lethal at 37°C or is essential at all temper - atures depending on the strain context . We have found a striking similarity between the las17 D phenotype and the phenotypes of ARP2 ts mutants . In addition to depolariza - tion of actin patches , many las17 D cells show actin aggre - gates in the bud and at the bud neck of large budded cells as is seen in ARP mutant cells . An independent study showed that aberrant aggregates in las17 D cells , as do cables , contain Sac6p but lack normal patch components coﬁlin and Cap2p ( Li , 1997 ) . Nor do aggregates appear to contain Arp2p or Arp3p . Interestingly , Arp2p - gfp still colocalized with resid - ual actin patches ( Figure 1B ; Dumoulin , unpublished obser - vations ) . Recent microscopic studies have conﬁrmed that cables and patches depend on each other for assembly and function ( Karpova et al . , 1998 ) . The fact that overexpression of LAS17 suppresses the formation of such structures in arp2 - 1 and arp2 - 2 mutants implicates Las17p and the Arp2 / 3 complex together in ﬁlament organization . Abnormally en - larged necks between mother and daughter cells are a fur - ther common defect of las17 D and certain ARP2 mutant cells , suggesting that Las17p and Arp2p may both be important for cytokinesis and / or cell division . This is consistent with the previously shown genetic interactions between arp2 - 1 and the septin cdc10 - 1 mutations ( Moreau et al . , 1996 ) . In further characterization of las17 D cells , deﬁcient a factor uptake lets us conclude that Las17p is essential for ligand - dependent receptor - mediated internalization in addition to ﬂuid phase endocytosis , whereas later steps of the endocy - tosis pathway are apparently functional . Internalization was severely deﬁcient at 24°C , at which cells continued to divide , as we have previously described for arp2 - 1 cells ( Munn et al . , 1995 ; Moreau et al . , 1997 ) . This step of endocytosis has also been shown to require actin and ﬁmbrin and many other cytoskeletal proteins , including End3p , Sla2p / End4p , Vrp1p / End5 Rvs161 / End6p , and Rvs167p ( Raths et al . , 1993 ; Munn and Riezman , 1994 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ) . We also investigated the in vivo relationship of Las17p to polarity and actin organization . Loss of the bipolar budding pattern in growing diploid cells points to a possible role for Las17p in establishment of cell growth polarity . Further - more , in the presence of latrunculin - A , functional Las17 - gfp , probably with other proteins , remains in cortical patches in a polarized distribution in the absence of any detectable concentration of ﬁlamentous or total actin . Las17p must therefore be upstream of actin with respect to the ﬂow of polarity information . Interestingly , certain other proteins important for polarity establishment , such as Cdc42p and Bem1p ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) as well as verprolin ( Vaduva et al . , 1997 ) , also show polarized localization independently of polymerized actin in virtually all cells , whereas others such as Bud6 / Aip3p , Myo2p , and calmodulin appear to maintain only partial polarity . Still other proteins that are important for the actin cytoskeleton and secretion , such as Arp2p , Aip1p , Sec4p , Sec8p , and Smy1p are dependent on actin structures for their polarized localization ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . The fact that las17 D strains show increased sensi - tivity to latrunculin - A in growth tests ( our unpublished results ) , in addition to being necessary for actin , Arp2p , and Arp3p localization , suggests that Las17p normally plays a role in polarized localization and in stabilization of the actin - polymerizing complex at the cortex . When the actin ﬁlament cytoskeleton is destroyed by latrunculin - A treat - ment , despite nonpolarized growth of cells ( in the absence of increase of cell numbers ) , proteins such as Las17p and ver - prolin remain polarized , suggesting that the ﬂow of polarity information necessary for polarized growth may also re - quire interaction with actin ﬁlaments for these proteins to function with the Arp2 / 3 complex . Although Las17p is not essential for growth in all conditions , it is clearly a major determinant in multiple cellular processes implicating the actin cytoskeleton . Elucidating Las17p Functions through its Interactions Genetic evidence for functional interaction between las17 D and ARP2 and ARP3 mutations is extended biochemically to indicate physical interaction with the coimmunoprecipita - tion of Arp2p and Las17p from crude extracts . How does high - copy expression of LAS17 overcome speciﬁc ARP2 and ARP3 ts mutations ? Las17p might interact directly with Arp2p or Arp3p despite the fact that we were unable to detect interactions between Las17p and Arp2p or Arp3p in two - hybrid tests . In this case , Arp2p or Arp3p might bind less tightly to Las17p , but higher expression of Las17p could compensate weak binding . Another interpretation of our results is that intermediary protein components are neces - sary to allow functional interaction of Las17p with the Arp2 / 3 complex . Las17p might interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex through contact with actin , with other subunits , or both . In vitro protein interaction between Las17p and actin was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation ( Li , 1997 ) , and the two proteins interact directly in the two - hybrid system . Direct interaction between bovine N - WASP and actin has also been shown in vitro . The WH2 domain or “verprolin homology” and the “coﬁlin homology” domains of N - WASP participated in actin binding ( Miki et al . , 1996 ) . Similar direct physical interactions with actin were conﬁrmed for both WASP and SCAR ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) . Because the WH2 domain is rather well conserved in the C - terminal region of the yeast homologue , it likely to be the region of Las17p that interacts with actin : GRGALLDQIRQ . . GIQLNKT ( WASP _ human Swiss prot ) GRDALLDQIRQ . . GIQL . KS ( N - WASP ; DDBJaccessionD88460 ) GRDALLASIRGAGGIGALRKV ( La17 _ yeast ; Swiss prot ) . SCAR and WASP were recently found to regulate the actin cytoskeleton through the Arp2 / 3 complex . The C - A . Madania et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 3534 terminal WA fragment ( WH2 and acidic domains ) of both the WASP and the SCAR homologues bind the p21 - Arc subunit ( equivalent to S . cerevisiae Arc18p ) of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) . The ARP2 allele - spe - ciﬁc interactions we found with las17 D are not inconsistent with a similar interaction in S . cerevisiae , because certain mutations could affect small subunit binding indirectly . However , we did not detect two - hybrid interactions be - tween a full - length Las17p and Arp2p , Arp3p , Arc35p , Arc40p , or any of the small subunits Arc19p , Arc18p , or Arc15p tested as activation fusions ( Table 4 ; our unpub - lished results ) . During the revision of this manuscript several in vitro studies pertinent to our results have been published . Las17p ( GST - Bee1p ) and the Arp2 / 3 complex have been coimmu - noprecipitated in yeast , an independent demonstration of the physical interaction we report here between Las17 - protA and the Arp2 / 3 complex . This interaction required both Arc19p and Arc15p ( Winter et al . , 1999 ) . Simultaneous re - quirement of two or more subunits could be an explanation for the lack of two - hybrid interactions . Further knowledge of the Arp2 / 3 complex topology will be necessary to under - stand whether the mammalian and yeast results represent the same overall interactions . In addition to the activation of the S . cerevisiae Arp2 / 3 complex by Las17p in vitro ( Winter et al . , 1999 ) , the direct role of WASP ( Yarar et al . , 1999 ) and SCAR ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ) in the activation of the in vitro nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex to generate new ﬁlament barbed ends has been elucidated in mammalian cells . It has been shown previously that Cdc42 , activated with guanosine 5 9 - 3 - O - ( thio ) triphosphate , induces actin polymer - ization in neutrophils ( Zigmond et al . , 1998 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex is one of the elements required for Cdc42 - induced actin polymerization in Acanthamoeba ( Mullins and Pollard , 1999 ) and Xenopus extracts ( Ma et al . , 1998 ) . Now , it has also been shown that the stimulation of actin nucleation by N - WASP binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex requires both the actin binding domain and the Arp2 / 3 complex binding do - main of N - WASP , as is the case for SCAR activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ) . Actin polymeriza - tion in the Xenopus system is enhanced by both Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol - ( 4 , 5 ) - biphosphate , linking signal trans - duction pathway molecules to the stimulation of actin poly - merization ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . Evidence that the combined action of WASP family members and the Arp2 / 3 complex are also directly dependent on Cdc42 in vivo ( Castellano et al . , 1999 ) comes from experiments which used a modifed plasma membrane receptor capable of inducible local re - cruitment of Cdc42 ( or WASP ) to show that activated Cdc42 ( or WASP ) triggered actin polymerization and subsequent formation of protrusions in whole cells . Las17p Shows Two - Hybrid Interaction with SH3 Domain Proteins Previous studies showed that proline - rich stretches of vari - ous proteins bind to SH3 domains ( Ren et al . , 1993 ) . SH3 domains are small regions ( ; 60 – 80 aa ) present in a large number of proteins showing similarity to a domain in c - src and v - src proto - oncogene proteins . The presence of several proline - rich stretches in Las17p suggests that it could inter - act directly with one or several SH3 domain proteins . In two - hybrid screens with Las17p bait , ﬁve of the nine pro - teins we identiﬁed as Las17p interactants contained an SH3 domain . Although the strength of possible in vivo interac - tions between complete proteins cannot be implied directly from the activation values of two - hybrid interaction , clones representing the SH3 domain with or without other parts of these proteins interacted strongly with full - length Las17p . One of these SH3 domain proteins was Rvs167p , which contains three domains , BAR / RVS , GPA , and SH3 . The SH3 domain with a few additional amino acids of the neighbor - ing GPA domain was sufﬁcient to show strong interaction with Las17p . Thus , in addition to the SH3 domain , Las17p - Rvs167p interaction may require participation of the GPA domain . Rvs167p is known to function with Rvs161p / End6p ( Navarro et al . , 1997 ) , which was also ﬁshed out in a screen for endocytosis - defective mutants as mentioned above ( Munn et al . , 1995 ) . In this screen we did not pick up Rvs161p ( which is homologous to Rvs167p except for lack of the C - terminal SH3 domain ) but it does interact with Las17p when tested directly ( Recordon - Navarro , 1998 ) , further sug - gesting that SH3 domains may not be solely responsible for interaction with Las17p . Rvs167p was previously found as an actin partner ( Amberg et al . , 1995 ) . Our results show that only Rvs167p fusions containing at least part of the N - terminal domain of Rvs167p interact with actin in two - hybrid tests ( $ aa 220 – 482 ; Table 4 ; our unpublished obser - vations ) . We also found that Las17p interacts strongly with verpro - lin ( Vrp1 / End5p ) . Verprolin has been shown to be part of the actin cytoskeleton and , like Las17p , is important for endocytosis and is a polarity determinant that localizes to polarized cortical patches independently of polymerized ac - tin ( Munn et al . , 1995 ; Vaduva et al . , 1997 ) . Results of an independent communication have been presented showing that the C - terminal half of Las17p binds verprolin ( Naqvi et al . , 1998 ) . Our results show that interactions of several dif - ferent fragments from a random genomic bank map the binding site of verprolin to the C terminus ; a fragment of only 35 C - terminal amino acids is sufﬁcient for strong bind - ing to Las17p . This interaction is comparable with that of WASP ( as bait ) with the human homologue of verprolin , WIP ( WASP - interacting protein ) , isolated in a two - hybrid screen . In two - hybrid tests a C - terminal 87 - aa truncation of WIP no longer bound to WASP , in good agreement with our mapping of the verprolin - Las17 interaction . Overexpression of WIP affected cortical actin assembly , inducing the forma - tion of actin - containing projections at the cell surface of human B cells ( Ramesh et al . , 1997 ) . Given that the las17 D genetic interaction with ARP2 and ARP3 mutants is allele speciﬁc , and that Las17p and Arp2p interact physically , Las17p is shown to be an effector of the Arp2 / 3 complex . These results coincide with multiple dem - onstrations in many systems of WASP family members’ interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex . We have also shown that Las17p interacts directly with actin , Rvs167p , and ver - prolin by two - hybrid analyses . Finally , results of our two - hybrid screen suggest that Las17p might interact with at least six other unknown proteins , four of which are SH3 domain proteins . The fact that Lsb1p has been localized in the nucleus by transposon tagging of genes with increased expression in stationary phase and that LSB4 / YSC84 expres - sion is increased 5 – 10 times during sporulation raises the Las17p Interacts with the Arp2 / 3 Complex Vol . 10 , October 1999 3535 question of how Las17p might integrate signals from differ - ent developmental processes . Possible implication of these new proteins in the actin cytoskeleton or in signaling mech - anisms are currently under investigation . Whereas Arp2p and Arp3p bind as a complex to actin ﬁlaments ( Mullins et al . , 1997 , 1998b ) , Las17p may bind only actin monomers , by analogy to SCAR and WASP ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) and verprolin ( Vaduva et al . , 1997 ) , which bind actin monomers in vitro . The absence of a concentra - tion of actin in Las17p patches after latrunculin - A treatment does not eliminate the possibility that Las17p recruits the ﬁrst monomers to cortical sites , but further studies are needed to clarify this possibility . The suppression of muta - tions in Arp2 / 3 complex components by LAS17 overexpres - sion could then be explained by increasing monomeric actin at nucleation sites . The polarized localization of Las17p re - ﬂects its anchorage in areas of cell surface growth , hence its potential for involvement in both plasma membrane and intracellular signaling . An attractive possibility is that Las17p , in association with verprolin and Rvs167p ( and perhaps with other proteins such as the Lsbp reported here ) , forms the essential part of a complex that remains anchored at the plasma membrane , receives diverse signals , and trans - mits them to the actin - polymerizing complex where Las17p plays a direct role in amplifying actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex .
