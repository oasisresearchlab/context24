Students’ Emotional Reactions to Programming Projects in Introduction to Programming : Measurement Approach and Influence on Learning Outcomes Alex Lishinski Michigan State University East Lansing , Michigan lishinsk @ msu . edu Aman Yadav Michigan State University East Lansing , Michigan ayadav @ msu . edu Richard Enbody Michigan State University East Lansing , Michigan enbody @ cse . msu . edu ABSTRACT Previous research has found that programming assignments can produce strong emotional reactions in introductory pro - gramming students . These emotional reactions often have to do with the frustration of dealing with difficulties and how hard it can be to overcome problems . Not only are these emotional reactions powerful in and of themselves , they have also been shown to induce students to make self - efficacy judgments , which can in turn cause adaptive or maladaptive behaviors , depending on the valence of the judgment . These results have been found in previous qualitative research in programming , however , to date no one has done a larger scale quantitative examination of emotional reactions in introduc - tory programming students . Furthermore , no one has tried to connect these emotional reactions systematically to stu - dent learning outcomes . Therefore , this study reports on the pilot use of a basic emotional reactions survey with a large class of undergraduate introductory programming students . Preliminary results are presented on how these emotional reactions affect students’ course outcomes over the short and longer term . KEYWORDS CS1 , Emotions 1 INTRODUCTION Educational psychology provides many theoretical constructs for understanding how students learn , which can deepen our understanding of how students learn to program , but CS education research has largely neglected to draw upon them [ 1 ] [ 23 ] . One example of this neglect is in the domain of stu - dents’ affective experiences , which are an important part of the learning process in any subject .

Some qualitative research in CS education has investigated the role of emotional reac - tions and found some significant commonalities in the ways that students experience learning to program emotionally [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] . However , a broader quantitative examination of these constructs is still non - existent . Students’ emotions while doing academic tasks have been studied in a variety of settings , and have been shown to be connected to other affective characteristics ( such as self - efficacy ) as well as academic outcomes [ 14 ] . One study found that emotions experienced while doing homework assignments were different from emotions experienced in the classroom , and that homework emotions were linked to academic self - concept and achievement outcomes [ 9 ] . Another study found that unpleasant emotions during homework sessions was negatively related to both effort and achievement , and that unpleasant emotions were related to the perceived quality of the homework assignment [ 7 ] . Previous research related to non - routine problem solving found a significant influence of emotions on students’ self - regulation during problem solving tasks [ 10 ] . Given the salience of emotional episodes particular to programming , as documented by Kinnunen and Simon , as well as the significant impact of emotions on academic outcomes generally , the topic of students’ emotional reactions to programming projects merits further investigation . 1 . 1 Emotional Reactions and the CS Gender Participation Gap Prior research on gender participation gap in CS has indi - cated that part of the explanation for the gap may have to do students’ affective experiences , because male and female students have been found to differ in their affective experi - ences , both in CS and across academic settings . For example , girls have been found to have lower self - efficacy than boys in math and science , despite no prior differences on aptitude or performance [ 17 ] . Likewise , female students in computer science have lower self - efficacy and comfort levels than their male peers [ 3 ] [ 5 ] . Research has also suggested that there are differences in attributions of success between genders , with female students being more likely than male students to attribute success in CS to luck rather than ability [ 30 ] [ 6 ] . Previous research has also indicated that the affective factors that influence success may differ between male and Session 2 : Student Perception , Conception , Reaction ICER’17 , August 18 – 20 , 2017 , Tacoma , WA , USA female students . For example , women’s performance in CS courses is significantly related to comfort level and percep - tions of gender equity , which is not the case for male students [ 3 ] [ 2 ] . Likewise , differences in emotional reactions between genders have been found in other settings , with previous stud - ies finding that female students felt less pride and greater shame in response to their work in a math class than their male peers [ 26 ] . Given these indications of the importance of affective experiences and the importance of the gender gap in CS education research , gender differences in emotional reactions also merit further investigation . 1 . 2 Research Questions ∙ RQ1 : What are the connections between students’ emo - tional reactions to programming projects and their performance on those projects ? ∙ RQ2 : Which emotional reactions are most significantly related to programming project outcomes ? ∙ RQ3 : Are there any gender differences in students’ emotional reactions to programming projects ? ∙ RQ4 : Do students’ emotional reactions to program - ming projects indirectly affect later programming per - formance ? 2 LITERATURE REVIEW 2 . 1 Emotional Reactions in CS Education Research The emotional experiences students have while learning to program and their influence on students’ learning are the major focus of this study . In a series of studies , Kinnunen and Simon offered a detailed qualitative account of students’ emotional experiences while working on programming assign - ments using data from open - ended interviews [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] . Their study was informed by earlier work of Eckerdal et al . which examined CS threshold concepts , which are core disciplinary concepts around which curriculum should be organized [ 16 ] , but are often troublesome to learn [ 8 ] . One of the questions investigated by Eckerdal et al . [ 8 ] was : what emotional reactions do students express when learning thresh - old concepts ? Through interviews they learned that students often felt frustrated , depressed , and humbled , but also eventu - ally became confident , when they had succeeded in grasping the concept . The goal of Kinnunen and Simon’s study was to further investigate the common emotional experiences of programming students [ 11 ] . Kinnunen and Simon’s initial interviews elicited high level reflections from students at the end of the first year of starting a programming course [ 11 ] . It is important to note that Kinnunen and Simon did not have access to students’ immediate emotional reactions to the programming projects , because they interviewed students at the end of the term . The authors narrowed the emotions of interest down to five categories : Proud / Accomplished , Frus - trated / Annoyed , Inadequate / Disappointed , Relaxed / Relief , and Apprehensive / Reluctant . They also identified an overall emotional trajectory that was a prototype of what students generally experienced , highlighting the most emotionally salient events . The authors found that students often felt un - sure when beginning an assignment , which often caused them to make negative self - efficacy judgments of themselves . Next , after working for a while , students inevitably encountered difficulties , which often caused a unique sort of emotional reaction . Kinnunen and Simon described this as the ”struck by lightning” experience , which is characterized by difficulties that were very surprising to students . The authors found that this rapid change of emotion when experiencing a difficulty often led to negative self - efficacy assessments . 2 . 1 . 1 Emotional Reactions and Self - efficacy . Kinnunen and Simon’s initial study found general patterns of students’ emotional reactions to programming assignments , but there was one important commonality to all students’ experiences [ 11 ] . Students made self - efficacy assessments as a result of their emotional reactions when working on programming assignments . Based on this observation , Kinnunen and Si - mon followed up with a study that examined how students’ emotional reactions influenced their self - efficacy assessments [ 12 ] . The results suggested that both positive and negative programming experiences could result in either positive or negative self - efficacy assessments . The combination of posi - tive experiences and positive self - efficacy judgment and neg - ative experiences with negative self - efficacy judgments were unsurprising . However , students also made counterintuitive self - efficacy assessments in some situations . For example , the authors found that some students who had a negative pro - gramming experience could maintain a positive self - efficacy judgment , being confident that they would eventually get it , despite current difficulties . By contrast , students who had a positive programming experience , such as finishing the project , may have also received other cues that led them to maintain a negative self - efficacy assessment . Based on their observations in this study , Kinnunen and Simon made a num - ber of recommendations to help students avoid difficulties due to negative self - efficacy judgments . For example , they recommended that programming instructors avoid inducing repeated failures early on in the learning experience [ 12 ] . The connection between emotional reactions and self - efficacy is important because of the known influence of self - efficacy on students’ academic success , which has been well documented in many subject areas , such as mathematics [ 18 ] , science [ 4 ] , and language arts [ 19 ] . Self - efficacy has also been shown to be related to resiliency in response to complex and difficult tasks [ 25 ] . Self - efficacy has also been found to significantly influence success in CS [ 28 ] [ 31 ] [ 22 ] . Furthermore , previous work in CS education has suggested that self - efficacy beliefs function as a reciprocal feedback loop [ 15 ] . This suggests that emotional reactions , by influencing self - efficacy judgments , could have longer term impacts on students’ learning outcomes . Given the documented importance of self - efficacy , emotional reac - tions merit further investigation as possible precursors to self - efficacy that can help us better understand the process by which self - efficacy beliefs are formed . Session 2 : Student Perception , Conception , Reaction ICER’17 , August 18 – 20 , 2017 , Tacoma , WA , USA 3 PURPOSE AND GOALS OF STUDY The purpose of this study is to provide a quantitative ex - ploration of students’ emotional reactions when doing pro - gramming assignments in CS1 . The previous qualitative work by Kinnunen and Simon provided an informative picture of typical emotional reactions that students have when do - ing programming assignments , but it remains unclear what impact these emotional reactions have on students’ learn - ing outcomes , and what patterns emerge when examining these emotional reactions with a larger set of students . Given the previously observed influence of affective experiences in explaining student outcomes as well as the under - explored but promising usefulness of affective experiences for explain - ing the gender participation gap , emotional reactions merit further study . The goal of this study is to pilot an emotional reactions survey administered concurrently with students’ program - ming project experiences . The questions seek to measure the most important categories of emotional reactions identified by Kinnunen and Simon , but to do so in the most valid way possible by measuring students’ emotions as part of their programming project experiences . This study then seeks to connect students’ emotional reactions with their learning outcomes , and to investigate their relative importance in influencing these outcomes . The overall goal for these anal - yses is to provide a clearer picture of the impact of these emotional experiences . 4 METHODS 4 . 1 Participants and Setting This study investigated students’ emotional reactions to pro - gramming assignments with a sample of 388 students enrolled in an introductory programming course ( CS1 ) at a large re - search university . The sample included 302 ( 77 . 8 % ) male students , and 86 ( 22 . 2 % ) female students . The course was taught in a flipped format where students watched video lectures and attended lab sessions with a TA to complete lab exercises . 4 . 2 Measurement Approach The data for this study was collected using a set of 4 self - report Likert items . Three of these four items were devised specifically for this study to measure students’ emotional reactions to working on programming assignments . The three items were written based on Kinnunen and Simon’s qualita - tive research , which identified five main categories of emotions that students used to describe their emotions while doing programming assignments [ 11 ] . These categories included : happy / proud , frustrated / annoyed , inadequate / disappointed , relaxed / relief , and tired / apprehensive . Of these five cate - gories of student emotions , the first three were used as the basis for the emotional response survey . This was done to keep the survey very brief , and also because the final two categories seemed somewhat redundant . Students were asked to respond to these questions on a 7 - point Likert scale indi - cating the degree to which their experiences working on the project made them feel proud , frustrated , and inadequate . The fourth item was taken from the self - efficacy sub - scale of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire ( MSLQ ) [ 20 ] . The self - efficacy item was included due to the inter - twined nature of emotional reactions and self - efficacy [ 12 ] , and in order to provide a known basis for comparison for the emotion question data . The self - efficacy item used the prompt ” Considering the difficulty of the course , the teacher , and my skills , I think I will do well in this class . ” This item was chosen because it had a high correlations with the MSLQ self - efficacy scale as a whole ( Pintrich et al . 1993 ) , and it was administered on a 7 point likert scale . The 4 questions are included in appendix A . 4 . 3 Programming Learning Outcomes The course grade consisted of 3 multiple choice examinations ( 2 midterm and 1 final ) , which made up 45 % of the course grade , 11 programming projects , which made up 45 % of the course grade , and homework exercises , which made up 10 % of the course grade . The analysis for this study focused on the project grades because the study examined students’ emotional reactions to programming assignments specifically , which also provide a deeper look at students’ understanding of programming . The projects were graded according to a rubric that varied from project to project , but included some common themes such as correct coding format , and correct implementation of subcomponents of the program . 5 DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS The four questions were administered to all students nine times over the semester by instructing students to insert their responses as a comment at the bottom of their project source code file for projects 3 - 11 . This was done in order to gauge emotional reactions as close to the actual experience as possible . To answer the research questions of this study , several statistical analyses were done . All analyses were performed in R version 3 . 2 . 3 [ 21 ] , with plots produced by the ggplot2 pack - age [ 29 ] and the DiagrammeR package [ 27 ] , and structural equation models done using the lavaan package [ 24 ] . To determine the connections between the emotional re - actions and students’ project scores , Pearson correlation coefficients are reported for each of the nine repeated mea - sures of the four emotional reaction questions with their corresponding project scores . To determine whether gender differences exist on emotional reactions , the mean differences between male and female students across the nine repeated measures are reported for each of the four emotional reaction questions , along with the statistical significance of these differences drawn from t - tests . To determine which of the emotional reaction questions had the largest influence on student learning outcomes , a multiple regression analysis was conducted . Mean emotional reactions Session 2 : Student Perception , Conception , Reaction ICER’17 , August 18 – 20 , 2017 , Tacoma , WA , USA were combined from across the nine repeated measures , and the influence of these four average emotional reactions on total programming project scores was assessed with the re - gression model ; regression coefficients and variance explained are reported . Finally , to determine whether students’ emotional reactions had a significant impact on their later project performance , mediation analysis was conducted for each of the four emo - tional reactions . Each of the emotional reaction questions were analyzed for their short and long term impact on stu - dents’ programming outcomes using path analysis models , taking account of both direct and indirect effects of emotional reactions while controlling for previous project performance . 6 RESULTS 6 . 1 Descriptive Statistics To determine the connection between emotional reactions and project scores , Pearson correlations were calculated . The correlations between emotional response questions and their corresponding project are shown in table 1 .

Furthermore , the correlations were statistically significant in almost every instance , which is evidence supporting the robustness of these relationships . 6 . 1 . 1 Gender Differences in Emotional Reactions . The levels of the emotional reactions were examined for differences between male and female students . The mean differences for each of the repeated measures of the questions are shown in figures 1 - 4 . Figure 1 shows the gender mean differences for the self - efficacy ( will do well ) question . In every instance of the self - efficacy question , male students rated themselves on average more likely to do well than did female students , but only 2 of these differences were statistically significant . Figure 2 shows the gender mean differences for the frus - trated questions . In every instance of the frustrated questions , male students rated themselves as feeling less frustrated than 4 . 4 4 . 8 5 . 2 5 . 6 P03 P04 P05 P06 P07 P08 P09 P10 P11 Will Do Well Repeated Measures M ean e m o t i ona l r ea c t i on Gender female male Will Do Well Means by Gender Figure 1 : Mean responses for self - efficacy ( will do well ) questions by gender . Black bars indicate signif - icant mean differences ( p < . 05 ) female students on average . These differences were statis - tically significant in three instances , all in the first half of the course , after which male and female reported frustration levels converged while both decreased substantially over time . Figure 3 shows the gender mean differences for the inade - quate questions . In every instance of the inadequate questions , female students rated themselves as feeling more inadequate than male students on average . These differences were statis - tically significant in the first three instances of the question , after which male and female reported inadequacy levels con - verged as both decreased substantially over time . Figure 4 shows the gender mean difference for the proud questions . The proud questions showed no significant differ - ences by gender . Overall these results do not warrant any strong general conclusions about gender differences in emotional reactions , but the significant takeaway is that for three of the four questions , male and female students showed consistently different levels of emotional reactions , even though most of these differences were not significant . Also of note is the fact that for the two negative emotions ( frustration and Session 2 : Student Perception , Conception , Reaction ICER’17 , August 18 – 20 , 2017 , Tacoma , WA , USA 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 P03 P04 P05 P06 P07 P08 P09 P10 P11 Frustrated question Repeated Measures M ean e m o t i ona l r ea c t i on Gender female male Frustrated Means by Gender Figure 2 : Mean responses for frustrated questions by gender . Black bars indicate significant mean dif - ferences ( p < . 05 ) inadequacy ) , the largest differences between male and female students came at the beginning of the course . This pattern fits with findings from previous research showing that the affective component of the experience of learning to program has a greater influence at the beginning of the course [ 12 ] , particularly for female students [ 15 ] . At the very least , these results suggest that further investigation of the differences between male and female students’ affective experiences while learning to program is warranted . 6 . 2 Regression Analysis Multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine how much variance in overall project scores was explained by the emotional reaction questions . The outcome was total project scores , and the independent variables were the average over all the repeated measures of the emotional reaction questions for each student . The four emotional response question averages explained a total of 16 . 5 % of the variance in project scores . This variance was explained primarily by the self - efficacy ( will do well ) and frustrated questions , with the inadequate and proud questions not having a significant relationship to 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 P03 P04 P05 P06 P07 P08 P09 P10 P11 Inadequate Repeated Measures M ean e m o t i ona l r ea c t i on Gender female male Inadequate Means by Gender Figure 3 : Mean responses for inadequate questions by gender .

Students’ confidence that they will do well had a positive impact on outcomes , which corresponds to what prior research says about the importance of self - efficacy . Results also suggested that students’ frustration with the assignment has a strong negative influence on outcomes . The data does not warrant any conclusions about why frustration Session 2 : Student Perception , Conception , Reaction ICER’17 , August 18 – 20 , 2017 , Tacoma , WA , USA 4 . 5 5 . 0 5 . 5 6 . 0 P03 P04 P05 P06 P07 P08 P09 P10 P11 Proud question Repeated Measures M ean e m o t i ona l r ea c t i on Gender female male Proud Means by Gender Figure 4 : Mean responses for proud questions by gen - der . had more of an influence than feelings of inadequacy or pride , but perhaps frustration is a feeling that is more immediate to the experience of programming , so when students were asked at the end of the experience to assess this feeling , they were more able to do so , whereas the feeling of inadequacy and pride were more removed from the experience which became more distinct with reflection . 6 . 3 Path Analysis Models Path analysis models were used to perform mediation analy - sis to determine whether or not emotional reactions mediated the relationship between past performance and future perfor - mance . The hypothesis was that performance on a project would have a direct and indirect effect on future performance . A direct effect corresponds to the influence of the program - ming competency that the student has gleaned from the earlier assignment . Indirect effects , on the other hand , would indicate that performance on the earlier assignment caused an emotional reaction , which then in turn affected future performanceThedirect and indirect effects of each of the four emotional reactions were investigated both in the short and long term . Figure 5 : Path Model for Short Term Effects of Emo - tional Responses on Project Scores To test these two possible relationships , two mediation model specifications were used for each emotional reaction . First , to investigate short term effects , the emotional reactions from project 3 ( the first time that the emotional reaction questions were asked ) were tested for direct and indirect effects on project 4 scores . The model specification included direct effects of both project 3 and the emotional reaction question on project 4 , as well as the indirect effect of project 3 on project 4 , mediated by the emotional reaction . The model is shown in figure 5 . The impact of gender on the emotional reaction question was also included to control for any gender differences . The direct and indirect effects for each of the 4 emotional reactions are shown in tables 3 - 6 . All coefficients shown are standardized . Table 3 shows the short term effects of the self - efficacy ( will do well ) question . The direct effect and the indirect effect of the will do well question were not significant .

The direct effect of the frustrated question was significant , and about 60 % of the size of the effect of project 3 . The indirect effect of the frustrated question was also significant , indicating that students’ frustration with project 3 negatively impacted their outcomes on project 4 .

The significant effects of this question shows that students’ general sense of frustration after project 3 impacted their short term future performance . The indirect effect of frustration indicated that frustration on one project has a negative impact on future performance , which suggested that doing worse on project 3 not only caused students to do worse on project 4 due to the effects of not gaining the competency from project 3 , but also because of the frustration caused by doing poorly . This Figure 6 : Path Model for Long Term Effects of Emo - tional Responses on Project Scores pattern is an indication of an emotional feedback loop for frustration . The second mediation model specification tested the long term direct and indirect effects of early emotional reactions . These models included the direct effects of project 3 and the emotional reaction question on the aggregate of the last three projects completed in the course ( projects 9 , 10 , 11 ) . The aggregate was taken to make the investigation of longer term effects more robust . The model also included the indirect effect of project 3 on the last three project , mediated by the emotional reaction question . The model is shown in figure 6 . The impact of gender on the emotional reaction question was also included to control for any gender differences . The direct and indirect effects for each of the four emotional reactions are shown in tables 7 - 10 . Table 7 shows the long term effects of the self - efficacy ( will do well ) question . The direct effect of self - efficacy on the last three project scores was significant , and about 45 % of the size of the impact of project 3 scores . The indirect effect was also significant , indicating that students’ later project scores were not just impacted by the programming ability evinced by their scores on project 3 but also by how the project affected their confidence that they will do well .

The significant direct effects demon - strated that students’ self - efficacy , as well their feelings of frustration and inadequacy caused by their early experiences have a lasting impact on their later performance over the length of the course . The significant indirect effects provided evidence for a feedback loop process for these emotional reac - tions as well , although in the case of students self - efficacy and feelings of inadequacy , these indicators only showed up over the long term . Nevertheless , the path models indicated that with the exception of feelings of pride , students’ emotional reactions to programming projects had significant effects on future programming project outcomes . 7 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The results of this study both confirm and clarify the im - portance of students’ emotional reactions to programming assignments . Students’ emotional reactions correlate with their performance on programming projects , with the va - lence of the emotion dictating the direction of the correlation . There were some systematic differences in emotional reac - tions for male and female students , although future research is needed to further investigate the robustness and impli - cations of these differences . The most important emotional reaction was frustration , and self - efficacy was also impor - tant as previous research would suggest . Finally , three of the four emotional reactions exhibited significant long or short term effects on future programming performance , indicating that they significantly influenced future performance , and that these effects on future performance can be long lasting . The observed indirect effects of emotional reactions provided evidence that emotional reactions contribute to a feedback loop process in learning to program , and that previous per - formance impacts future performance both by virtue of the effect that past experiences have on learning , but also via the effect that past experiences have on emotions . Overall , the results of this study illustrate that students’ emotional reactions while learning to program are significant and need to be examined further . The results of this study are limited in a couple of main ways . First , students’ emotional reactions were measured with single indicators that have not been previously vali - dated . Given the exploratory nature of this study we believe this was a reasonable approach , but future investigations might aim to make use of previously developed instruments that may offer more reliable and robust indicators of stu - dents’ emotional reactions . Second , using a more robust and established theoretical framework for understanding students emotions would potentially make the results more reliable and generalizable . The study was designed to extend the previous research by Kinnunen and Simon , but there are other formal frameworks for modeling emotions that could potentially enable more robust follow up research . A EMOTIONAL RESPONSE QUESTIONS The 4 survey questions used for this study were presented as follows : Session 2 : Student Perception , Conception , Reaction ICER’17 , August 18 – 20 , 2017 , Tacoma , WA , USA For each of the following statements , please respond with how much they apply to your experience completing the programming project , on a 7 - point scale where 1 = Not true of me at all and 7 = Extremely true of me : ∙ Upon completing the project , I felt proud / accomplished ∙ While working on the project , I often felt frustrated / annoyed ∙ While working on the project , I felt inadequate / stupid ∙ Considering the difficulty of this course , the teacher , and my skills , I think I will do well in this course .
