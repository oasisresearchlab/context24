Using purified adult retinal ganglion cells ( RGcs ) in culture , we demonstrated here that VeGf is released by RGcs themselves to promote their own survival , while VEGF neutralization by specific antibodies or traps drastically reduced the RGc survival . these results indicate an autocrine VeGf neuroprotection on RGcs . in parallel , VeGf produced by mixed retinal cells or by mesenchymal stem cells exerted a paracrine neuroprotection on RGCs . Such neuroprotective effect was obtained using the recombinant VEGF - B , suggesting the involvement of VEGF - R1 pathway in VEGF - elicited RGC survival . Finally , glaucomatous patients injected with VEGF traps ( ranibizumab or aflibercept ) due to either AMD or DME comorbidity , showed a significant reduction of RGC axon fiber layer thickness , consistent with the plausible reduction of the VeGf autocrine stimulation of RGcs . our results provide evidence of the autocrine neuroprotective function of VeGf on RGcs is crucially involved to preserve injured RGcs such as in glaucomatous patients . Vascular endothelium growth factor - A ( VEGF ) is well known for its role in the promotion of angiogenesis . It belongs to a family composed by four distinct glycoproteins : VEGF - A , refers to VEGF as the founding member 1 , while the other main members are VEGF - B , VEGF - C and VEGF - D 2 – 4 . Their biological actions are mediated by three different VEGF receptors , which belong to the tyrosine - kinase receptor group : VEGF - Receptor1 ( VEGF - R1 ) ; VEGF - Receptor2 ( VEGF - R2 ) and VEGF - Receptor3 ( VEGF - R3 ) . While VEGF - B stimulates only VEGF - R1 , VEGF - A can activate both VEGF - R1 and - R2 . Differently , VEGF - C and VEGF - D bind preferentially to VEGF - R3 4 . Except its pro - angiogenic action , VEGF has displayed protective effects , in particular on neuronal cells as suggested by some studies . Hence , VEGF reduces the glutamate - induced excitotoxicity on hippocampal neurons 5 and protects these cells against hypoxia 6 . In eye , VEGF was described as anti - apoptotic factor for photoreceptors 7 , as well as for Müller cells 8 and retinal pigment epithelium cells 9 . In recent years , anti - VEGF therapies have become important treatments to limit tumor growth and suppress neovascularization in retinal diseases such as age - related macular degeneration ( AMD ) and diabetic macular edema ( DME ) 10 . Anti - VEGF therapies for eye diseases have clear - cut medical benefits , resulting in the regression of neovessels and improvement of visual acuity 11 , 12 . However , recent data suggest that anti - VEGF therapies may alter the thickness of the nerve fiber layer , which is composed of retinal ganglion cell ( RGC ) axons on their way to the optic nerve 13 . This negative effect of anti - VEGF therapies on RGCs is consistent with recent reports on the role of VEGF in the neuroprotection of RGCs in animal models of retinal ischemia 14 , optic nerve transection 15 , and glaucoma 16 . However , the cellular mechanisms of VEGF - mediated neuroprotection on RGCs are still unclear , including whether it acts directly or indirectly on RGCs . Here , we provide evidence that VEGF can directly affect RGC survival by activating their VEGF receptors in an autocrine / paracrine mode . open 1 Sorbonne Université , INSERM , CNRS , Institut de La Vision , 17 rue Moreau , 75012 Paris , France . 2 UMS 29 INSERM Plateforme FluExGen UPMC , 75012 Paris , France . 3 CHNO Des Quinze - Vingts , DHU Sight Restore , INSERM - DGOS CIC 1423 , 75012 Paris , France . 4 Fondation Ophtalmologique Adolphe de Rothschild , 75020 Paris , France . 5 Department of Ophthalmology , The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh , PA 15213 , USA . 6 Centre Monticelli Paradis , 433 bis rue Paradis , 13008 Marseille , France . 7 Aix Marseille Univ , CNRS , INT , Inst Neurosci Timone , 13005 Marseille , France . * email : nifroger @ yahoo . fr ; serge . picaud @ inserm . fr 2 Vol : .

We previously showed that conditioned medium isolated from mixed retinal cell cultures ( CM - M ) can promote the survival of enriched adult rat RGCs in cultures 17 . This effect occurred either in the presence or in the absence of B27 supplement and persisted until 21 days in vitro ( DIV ) ( Fig . S1 ) . We identified the neuroprotective factors contained in this CM - M using the Luminex assay for rat trophic factors . All samples ( n = 4 ) of CM - M contained a large amount of VEGF - A 164 , but no other factors known to promote RGC survival ( i . e . BDNF , G - CSF , and GM - CSF ; Table 1 ) . The presence of VEGF was confirmed and quantified by ELISA technique ( 106 . 1 ± 22 . 6 pg / ml , mean ± SEM , n = 9 ) . Mixed retinal cultures are composed of a monolayer of macroglial and microglial cells , upon which are found retinal neurons ( mainly cone photoreceptors and bipolar cells ; Fig . S2 ) . We attributed the origin of VEGF synthesis to microglial cells because these purified cells can produce substantial levels of VEGF in most cultures after only 48 h ( 17 . 8 ± 21 . 7 pg / ml ; n = 22 ; Fig . S3 ) . P urified macroglial cells ( including Müller glial cells ) did not produce VEGF ( Fig . S3 ) , in contrast to results reported in previous studies on isolated Müller cells 18 or a human Müller cell line ( MIO - M1 ) 9 . In parallel , we found that conditioned medium from mesenchymal stem cells ( CM - MSC ) , which contained VEGF , can also promote RGC survival ( Fig . 1A – E ) . We assessed whether the VEGF contained in these two dif - ferent conditioned media ( CM - MSC and CM - M ) contributed to RGC survival . First , purified adult rat RGCs were incubated with the CM - MSC , in the presence of a specific antibody against VEGF - A 164 ( rabbit polyclonal IgG , 0 . 5 µg / ml ) . This anti - VEGF antibody completely suppressed the RGC survival effect produced by the CM - MSC ( p < 0 . 01 , Fig . 1C , D ) . Indeed , there was a linear correlation ( r 2 = 0 . 78 ) between the VEGF concentration in each CM - MSC and its efficiency in promoting RGC survival ( Fig . 1E ) . Secondly , we obtained a significant reduction of the CM - M - induced neuroprotection ( p < 0 . 01 ) when the anti - VEGF antibody was added to retinal CM - M ( Fig . 1F ) . However , the neuroprotective effect of CM - M was not completely suppressed and remained significant ( p < 0 . 01 as compared to control ) in presence of the anti - VEGF . This observation may result from the presence of other neurotrophins in CM - M ( e . g . NGF or GDNF , other than BDNF which were undetectable in CM - M ) since the detection of growth factors via our Luminex assay was not exhaustive . Finally , we tested a control rabbit polyclonal IgG targeting another protein ( anti - NF200 ) , and we found that the CM - M - enhanced RGC survival was not significantly affected ( Fig . 1G ) . This result indicates that the VEGF present in the two different conditioned media is partially responsible for the trophic effects on RGCs . VeGf is an autocrine factor produced by RGcs to promote their own survival . Surprisingly , the antibody directed against VEGF - A 164 has also reduced per se the survival of purified RGCs by 34 . 8 % when they were cultured in a commercial VEGF - free culture medium ( p < 0 . 05 , see Fig . 1F ) . This result suggests that RGCs themselves can release VEGF into culture medium . Indeed , when RGCs were initially seeded at 8000 cells per well , measurable concentrations of VEGF - A 164 were detected in the culture medium at 6 and 12 DIV by ELISA , whereas VEGF was non - detectable at 1 DIV ( not shown ) . From 70 to 75 % of harvested supernatants contained detectable VEGF - A 164 after 6 to 12 DIV , with concentrations reaching 81 . 3 ± 12 . 7 pg / ml at 6 DIV . At 6 DIV , the increase of seeding density from 8 × 10 3 to 50 × 10 3 cells / well improved the RGC survival ( Fig . 2A , B ) and increased the percentage of VEGF - positive supernatants from 12 to 100 % , respectively ( Fig . 2C ) . VEGF concentrations also substantially and significantly increased with higher seeding density ( p < 0 . 001 , Kruskal – Wallis test ; Fig . 2C ) . More importantly , the VEGF - A 164 concentrations highly correlated with the actual number of surviving RGCs ( p < 0 . 001 , Spearman test ) , the curve being best fitted with an exponential regression ( r 2 = 0 . 65 ) ( Fig . 2D ) . These measures are therefore consistent with a correlation between the level of free VEGF ( 0 - 600 pg / ml ) and RGC survival ( 0 – 6000 RGCs per well ) . The expression of VEGF in healthy RGCs as in cultured RGCs was confirmed by anti - VEGF immunolabelling of retinal sections and purified RGC cultures ( Fig . S4 ) in agreement with previous reports 9 , 19 . These measures are also consistent with the detection of VEGF - A mRNA in embryonic RGCs 20 and our adult rat RGCs ( data not shown ) . Altogether , these results indicate that VEGF is an autocrine factor for RGCs . The importance of VEGF for RGC survival was finally verified using various VEGF trapping molecules : ( i ) a mouse monoclonal anti - human VEGF ( anti - pan , non - selective for VEGF - A isoforms ) , ( ii ) a rabbit polyclonal antibody against murine VEGF - A 164 ( i . e . selective for isoform 164 ) , and ( iii ) ranibizumab ( the Fab fragment from a humanized mouse monoclonal anti - VEGF - A , non - selective for isoforms ) . These anti - VEGF proteins all induced a statistically significant dose - dependent reduction of RGC survival after 6 DIV ( Fig . 2E ) . The efficacy of ranibizumab became significant at relatively high concentrations ( above 250 µg / ml ; Fig . 2E ) . Both the specific Table 1 .

In contrast , the pan antibody ( non - selective for VEGF - A isoforms ) reduced the proportion of samples with a detectable level of VEGF but did not significantly affect the mean VEGF concentrations in the medium , although it affected its neuroprotective effectiveness , probably due to the reduction of free VEGF ( not bound to an antibody ) . The mean values of VEGF concentrations were calculated , including undetect - able values defined as zero . We found that if anti - pan did not significantly decrease the VEGF concentrations whatever the doses used ( 0 . 5 , 1 . or 2 . 0 µg / ml ) , the selective anti - VEGF - A 164 induced a significant decrease in VEGF concentrations in the culture medium at the two doses tested ( 0 . 5 and 2 . 0 µg / ml , p < 0 . 05 as compared to control condition ) . Similarly , ranibizumab induced a dose - dependent decrease of VEGF concentrations in culture medium , which appeared statistically significant at the dose of 250 , 500 and 1 , 000 µg / ml , respectively ( p < 0 . 05 as compared to control condition ) . VEGF - elicited RGC survival involves VEGF - R1 pathway . Using the recombinant VEGF - A 164 protein ( from rat ) , we consolidated that VEGF per se promotes the RGC survival . At the 10 ng / ml concentration the recombinant protein significantly increased the RGC survival ( + 41 . 8 % , p < 0 . 01 ) , whereas incubation at 1 ng / ml produced a slight increase ( + 14 . 3 % , Fig . 3A ) , but not statistically significant . To further assess the pharmacologi - cal pathway of the VEGF - elicited RGC survival , we investigated the involvement of VEGF receptors in VEGF - elicited RGC survival . Because VEGF - A binds at two distinct receptors named VEGF - R1 and VEGF - R2 21 , we used pharmacological agents in order to discriminate which of these receptors are activated by VEGF to promote the RGC survival . The VEGF - R2 receptor antagonist , ZM 323 , 881 ( ZM ) allows discerning the activity of VEGF - R1 versus - R2 receptors . Co application of ZM ( 5 nM ) in the culture medium with the recombinant VEGF - A ( 10 ng / ml ) did not affect the VEGF - mediated increase in RGC survival ( ZM + VEGF - A : + 31 . 4 % , VEGF - A : + 38 . 5 % ; Fig . 3B ) , while incubation of ZM alone did not show any significant changes on RGC survival ( + 8 . 0 % ) . These data suggested that the RGC survival is rather mediated through the VEGF - R1 activation . To verify this hypothesis , we applied a recombinant VEFG - B protein , which stimulates selectively the VEGF - R1 . Addition of Figure 1 .

In order to check the absence of VEGF - R3 implication in this neuroprotective efficacy , we finally applied the recombinant VEGF - D protein , which activates VEGF - R3 and in some proportion VEGF - R2 ( 4 ) . However , VEGF - D ( 0 . 5 ng / ml ) failed to increase the RGC survival ( + 1 . 7 % ; Fig . 3C ) . These results are consistent with the involvement of VEGF - R1 activation by VEGF , to promote RGC survival by VEGF - A . We could show expression of both VEGF - R1 and VEGF - R2—at the mRNA level—in freshly purified RGCs ( n = 3 ) , as shown by RT - PCR experiments ( Fig . 3D , E ) . We concluded that RGC survival relies on the VEGF - R1 activation . Anti - VEGF treatments alter the retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) thickness in glaucomatous patients .

Thus , we focused our investigations by measuring the RNFL thickness of glaucomatous patients , with either AMD or DME comorbidity , as compared to non - glaucomatous patients , all receiving anti - VEGF therapy . There was a statisti - cally significant decrease of RNFL thickness in the treated eyes ( injected eyes ) from the glaucomatous group , which appeared during the third month of treatment ( Fig . 4D ) . We can observe a quick decrease of the RNFL thickness during the first 3 months corresponding to the induction phase ( one intravitreal injection [ IVI ] each month ) whereas during the next phase the decrease is continuing , but less intensely ( but remaining significant ) , probably due to a less intensive treatment ( 3 . 4 and 3 . 2 IVI respectively for non - glaucomatous and glaucomatous patients during the following 9 months ) . In contrast , the RNFL thickness of the fellow control eye was stable ( Fig . 4D ) . This decrease was not associ - ated with significant changes in intra - ocular pressure ( IOP ) levels in either the injected or control eyes ( Fig . 4B ) . Figure 3 .

These observations suggest that anti - VEGF therapies could affect RGC survival in patients with already injured RGCs . Discussion This study provides evidence that VEGF is a neuroprotective factor for RGCs through an autocrine mechanism . We demonstrate in vitro that enriched adult rat RGCs cultured under serum - deprivation—a situation that mimics ischemic conditions—can release VEGF to promote their own survival . To our knowledge , such ability of RGCs to produce themselves VEGF has never been described yet for these retinal neurons , except in one study showing detectable VEGF amounts in supernatant harvested from RGC - 5 cell line 22 ; the nature of this cell line remaining controversial . Hence , this autocrine mechanism of neuroprotection may underlie the VEGF - elicited neuropro - tection of RGCs , as observed in vivo following optic nerve transection 15 and in glaucomatous animal models 16 . In retina , such neuroprotective action of VEGF involving an autocrine mechanism was already described for Müller cell line ( MIO - M1 ) and retinal pigment epithelium ( ARPE - 19 ) which can secrete VEGF to promote their own survival 8 , 9 . An autocrine mechanism was also suggested to explain the neuroprotective action of VEGF on embryonic cortical neurons 23 , and may be also involved in the VEGF neuroprotection of motoneurons 24 . In addition , we found that VEGF is released by microglial cells suggesting that it also exerts neuroprotection through paracrine pathway . Other studies attributed the paracrine action of VEGF through a secretion from retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) or from Müller cells . Indeed , VEGF is particularly expressed by RPE 25 and was also found in inner retina ( see Fig . 4S ) . In human retina , VEGF immunoreactivity was specifically expressed in Müller cell bodies 26 . Moreover , we demonstrate here that VEGF is among the essential factors of MSC secretome conferring a direct RGC protection . A paracrine action of VEGF may also explain part of the therapeutic effect provided by bone marrow - derived MSCs injected into eyes following optic nerve injury or glaucoma 27 , 28 . Our pharmacological investigations reveal that VEGF - elicited RGC survival is mediated through the VEGF - R1 stimulation . Indeed , VEGF neuroprotection was not blocked by the addition of VEGF - R2 antagonist , while it was reproduced by incubation of VEGF - B which only stimulates VEGF - R1 ( see 4 ) . VEGF - B was shown to stimulate the survival of RGC - 5 subjected to oxidative - stress , and it inhibits the apoptosis in the retina induced by axotomy , NMDA intra - vitreous injection or ischemia 29 , suggesting the neuroprotective effect of the VEGF - R1 signaling . On the other hand , it has been shown that VEGF can protect hippocampal neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity through the activation of VEGF - R2 signaling 5 , 6 . Furthermore , VEGF - R2 blockade aggravates neu - ronal degeneration in brain 22 , 30 , supporting the involvement of VEGF - R2 in VEGF neuroprotection . VEGF - R1 and VEGF - R2 belong to the tyrosine kinase receptor family and both trigger the PI3K / AKT and the MEK / ERK pathways involved in the VEGF neuroprotection 5 . Accordingly , VEGF - R1 and VEGF - R2 can be differentially implied in the neuroprotective effects of VEGF according to the cell types , but in RGCs , VEGF - R1 seems to be preferentially implied . VEGF production and release by adult rat RGCs demonstrate its role as an autocrine factor for these spiking retinal neurons . In vivo , VEGF is highly expressed by healthy RGCs as observed here by immunolabeling on retinal sections , while a lower expression is found in other cell types ( Fig . S4 ) . VEGF release could play a major physiological role because the extracellular space is small and RGC density is very high in the RGC layer . During development , the release of VEGF by RGCs may contribute to the development of the inner retinal vasculature 20 . We previously showed that cultured RGCs in low nutritive conditions ( without B27 serum ) have features highly reminiscent of ischemic conditions 17 . Therefore , such culture conditions can be considered as repre - sentative of glaucomatous ischemic conditions . As a consequence , these results suggest that the VEGF synthesis is also occurring in RGCs from glaucomatous patients . However , VEGF immunolabeling also demonstrated VEGF synthesis in healthy RGCs 14 , 15 . Although VEGF concentrations in cell cultures and vitreous are difficult to compare , it is surprising to note that VEGF concentrations released by our cultured RGCs were in a similar range or higher ( < 600 pg / ml ) than those measured in vitreous of control patients ( < 150 pg / ml ) 31 – 33 . It remains unclear if retinal pathologies affecting RGC survival like glaucoma alter VEGF release , thus participating in the dysregulation of ocular blood flow 34 . Apart from its effect on blood flow , reduced VEGF release due to RGC loss could affect the survival of the remaining RGCs in a vicious cycle . In fact , VEGF contents in the vitreous of glaucomatous patients were only measured in a recent study on patients affected by neovascular glaucoma , showing vitreous VEGF concentrations raising to 220 pg / ml 35 . VEGF contents were higher in vitreous from patients affected by retinal neovascularization , like proliferative diabetic retinopathy , going up to 500 pg / ml , and more ( > 1000 pg / ml ) according to various studies 31 – 33 , 36 . Interestingly , anti - VEGF treatment allowed to drastically reduce the VEGF concentrations in vitreous of these patients 33 . Regarding the healthy subjects , the vitreous VEGF concentrations do not exceed 150 pg / ml ( from 1 . 7 to 146 pg / Table 2 .

Although , these VEGF concentrations are in the same range or below those measured in RGC culture media ( up to 600 pg / ml ) , it is unlikely that RGCs provide the only source of VEGF . Indeed , we showed that microglial cells can also synthesize VEGF ( Fig . S3 ) and we previously confirmed other studies showing VEGF production by RPE cells 37 . In addition , others reported that a Müller cell line can also secrete VEGF amounts reaching more than 1000 pg / ml 9 . Therefore , vitreous VEGF is likely resulting from the production by all these retinal cells in vivo . The chronic administration of anti - VEGF therapies may enhance VEGF loss , leading to deleterious conse - quences for vulnerable RGCs , such as in glaucoma . This safety concern for anti - VEGF therapies is consistent with a previous study showing a significant loss of RNFL thickness after 12 months of intravitreal anti - VEGF injections in AMD patients 13 . This conclusion is further supported by a recent retrospective study showing that patients with continuous unilateral anti - VEGF treatment showed a significant decrease in both RNFL and RGC layer thickness during at least 24 months of follow - up 38 . However , other studies in patients with only AMD have not found any correlation between RNFL changes and anti - VEGF therapy 39 – 41 . In a recent study 42 which looked at patients with both glaucoma and AMD , the authors did not find a correlation between decrease nerve fiber layer and treatment . However , the main concern with this study is that they used a macular analysis of ganglion cells or RNFL , and the macular edema due to AMD may induce artifacts on the measures of thickness for each macular layer ( ganglion cells , RNFL ) with artificial increase , thus probably masking a thinning of these layers . Given these overall contradictory data , future clinical trials are needed to assess further if an anti - VEGF therapies sustainably affect RGC survival and thus the RNFL thickness in patients . Here , we provide further clinical evidence for this deleterious effect of anti - VEGF therapy , but in a glaucoma - tous population with already compromised RGCs . Repeated injection of anti - VEGF for AMD or DME induced a significant reduction of RNFL thickness over a period of 12 months in these glaucomatous patients . These results strongly suggest that VEGF is a major autocrine factor for adult human RGCs . Further studies are needed to demonstrate the potential therapeutic interest of VEGF receptor agonists in retinal diseases . Materials and methods further details of methods are provided in Supplement . Primary cell cultures from adult rat reti - nas . Cell culture experiments were performed with retina isolated from 8 - week - old Long - Evans rats , pur - chased from Elevage Janvier ( France ) . Animals were housed in the same room of animal facility under controlled conditions ( 21 ± 1 °C , 12 h / 12 h light / dark cycles , light on at 8 a . m . , and food and water available ad libitum ) . All experiments were in accordance with the European Union Directive ( 2010 / 63 / EU ) and with the ARVO ( Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology ) statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and visual Research . Experimental protocols were approved by the local ethics committee and the Ministère de la Recherche ( permission number # A - 75 - 1739 for NF ) . Mixed retinal cultures were maintained until confluence ( 10 – 12 DIV ) and then used to prepare conditioned medium from retinal mixed cultures ( CM - M ) . Primary cultures of RGCs were isolated using an immunopan - ning technique , according to the protocol adapted from that used on adult rats 43 , 44 . Purified RGCs were seeded at various densities and cultured in Neurobasal - A medium ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) containing glutamine and supplemented with B27 ( Invitrogen ) . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSc ) collection . Bone marrow was obtained from the femur cavities of rats after flushing with minimal essential medium ( α - MEM , Invitrogen ) containing 10 % fetal calf serum . MSCs were seeded at 200 , 000 cells / cm 2 and cultured until confluence . cell treatments . Enriched RGC were subjected to different treatment during the whole period of the RGC cultures ( 6 DIV ) . Conditioned media were applied at the dilution of 1 : 2 directly into RGC culture medium . The monoclonal mouse anti - VEGF - A ( anti - pan against all VEGF - A isoforms , Santa - Cruz Biotechnology , Dal - las , TX , USA ) , the polyclonal rabbit anti - murine VEGF - A 164 ( Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) , ranibizumab ( Lucen - tis® , Novartis , Bâle , Switzerland ; gift from Pr Matonti ) , a Fab fragment of the humanized monoclonal VEGF antibody ( neutralizes all VEGF isoforms ) and a polyclonal Ig - G ( rabbit polyclonal anti - NF200 ; Sigma - Aldrich , Saint - Louis , MO , USA ) were incubated directly into the culture medium of RGC cultures . Recombinant rat VEGF - A 164 protein ( R & D systems , Minneapolis , MI , USA ) , recombinant mouse VEGF - B 167 protein ( R & D sys - tems ) and recombinant rat VEGF - D 164 protein ( R & D systems ) were also directly added into the medium . The antagonist at VEGF - R2 receptor , ZM 323881 ( Tocris Biosciences , Ellisville , MO , USA ) was co - incubated with VEGF - A 164 . ZM 323881 ( 5 - [ [ 7 - ( benzyloxy ) quinazolin - 4 - yl ] amino ] - 4 - fluoro - 2 - methylphenol ) is a potent and selective inhibitor of VEGF - R2 tyrosine kinase in vitro ( IC 50 < 2 nM ) , compared with other receptor tyrosine kinases , including VEGF - R1 , a range of other receptor tyrosine kinases such as PDGFRβ , FGFR1 , EGFR and erbB2 ( IC 50 > 50 µM ) 45 . Automated counting of viable RGcs . RGC counting was realized after 6 DIV on alive cells labeled with calcein - AM ( producing a green fluorescence ; Invitrogen ) . Briefly , RGGs cultured in 96 - well plate , were incubated in a calcein - AM solution ( 1 . 3 µg / ml , diluted in Neurobasal - A medium ) for 1 h into the incubator ( humidified chamber , 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 ) . Calcein - positive RCGs were then automatically counted after a frame per frame scanning of the full well surface ( objective X10 ) , by using an inverted epifluorescence microscope ( TiE , Nikon , Champigny - sur - Marne , France ) equipped with a motorized stage and a CCD camera ( Roper Scientific , Evry , France ) . Measurement of growth factors . A microparticle bead - based multiplex assay was used to measure the growth factors VEGF , BDNF , G - CSF , and GM - CSF in supernatants from mixed retinal cells , using the Luminex 9 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) Scientific RepoRtS | ( 2020 ) 10 : 12409 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 020 - 68488 - z www . nature . com / scientificreports / 200 technology . VEGF - A 164 was specifically measured in supernatants from cell cultures using ELISA technique . Supernatants were harvested from mixed , glial or microglial or RGC cultures and frozen at − 80 °C until use . VEGF - A164 was then measured in supernatants using the “Rat VEGF Quantikine ELISA Kit” ( R & D system ) according the instructions of the kit . patients and clinical examinations . We conducted a prospective single - center real - life study on 20 patients ( 10 non - glaucomatous and 10 stabilized glaucomatous patients ) treated by intravitreal injections ( IVI ) of VEGF traps ( ranibizumab or aflibercept ; at least six intravitreal injections—6 . 4 vs 6 . 2—during 12 months ) . Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 2 . The eyes receiving IVI were included in the " injected " group , whereas the follow eyes ( without IVI ) were included in the " non - injected " group . Informed consent was obtained from all patients in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki for research involving human subjects . This study did not include a placebo group because it consists in a real - life study , and not a randomized , placebo - controlled and double - blind trial . The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the French Society of Ophthalmology ( IRB 00008855 Société Française d’Ophtalmologie IRB # 1 ) . Statistics . All data are expressed as means ± SEM . In ELISA experiments for detection of VEGF in culture medium , undetectable values ( below the detection threshold ) were defined as zero and included in the mean calculations . The Mann Whitney test was used to compare means of 2 groups . When more than 2 groups were compared , a non - parametric Kruskal – Wallis analysis of variance was performed and followed , in case of significance by a Dunns post - hoc test to compared means between each group . For clinical observations , the Friedman test was used for analysis of variance for repeated measures and followed by a Dunns post - hoc test to compared means between each group . For all statistical analysis , differences were considered significant at * p ≤ 0 . 05 , * * p ≤ 0 . 01 and * * * p ≤ 0 . 001 . Received : 12 March 2019 ; Accepted : 18 June 2020 References 1 .
