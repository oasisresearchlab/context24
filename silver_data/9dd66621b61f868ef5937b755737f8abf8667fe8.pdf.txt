These effects are achieved by tight spatiotemporal control over intracellular signalling pathways , including those that mediate cytoskeletal reor - ganisation . The ability of integrins to bind to ligands is governed by integrin conformation , or activity , and this is widely acknowledged to be an important route to the regulation of integrin function . Over the last 15 years , however , the pathways that regulate endocytosis and recycling of integrins have emerged as major players in controlling integrin action , and studying integrin trafﬁcking has revealed fresh insight into the function of this fascinating class of extracellular matrix receptors , in particular in the context of cell migration and invasion . Here , we review our current understanding of the contribution of integrin trafﬁcking to cell motility . Introduction Integrins are a family of receptors for ligands found in the extra - cellular space , including extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ligands found in basement membranes ( collagen IV and laminins ) , interstitial matrix ( collagen I and ﬁbronectin ) and coagulating blood ( ﬁbrin - ogen and thrombospondin ) [ 1 ] . Heterodimerisation of 18 a - integ - rin and 8 b - integrin subunits within the endoplasmic reticulum leads to the assembly of 24 distinct integrin receptors , which un - dergo further post - translational modiﬁcation in the Golgi appa - ratus before they reach the cell surface and are able to perform their myriad functions . Integrins can be broadly classiﬁed into RGD receptors ( which bind the peptide motif Arg - Gly - Asp ) , collagen receptors , laminin receptors and leukocyte - speciﬁc re - ceptors ; most integrins can interact with more than one ligand , and in fact different integrins can bind to the same ligands in many instances [ 1 , 2 ] . Genetic ablation of speciﬁc integrins has given insight into their critical role in development , and interac - tions between integrins and their ligands are known to control processes including cell proliferation , death , differentiation and migration [ 2 ] . Adhesion signalling via integrins is therefore a key contributor to both health and disease . Integrins are bi - directional signallers . Ligand binding and clus - tering of integrins provides a platform for the assembly of multi - meric complexes that provoke signalling responses downstream of integrin - mediated adhesion ( ‘outside - in’ signalling ) . Different types of adhesion complex ( nascent adhesions , focal contacts , focal adhesions and ﬁbrillar adhesions ) are formed in migrating cells , and they are characterised by maturation stage , subcellu - lar distribution and protein composition ( Figure 1 ) . Binding of intracellular factors , such as talins and kindlins , to the cyto - plasmic integrin tail regulates the activation status of integrins by inducing a conformational change to stabilise an extended conformation of integrin that has high afﬁnity for ligand ( ‘inside - out’ signalling ) [ 1 – 3 ] . The mechanisms regulating integrin activa - tion have been the focus of intense research activity over the last three decades and are therefore relatively well understood . Over the last 15 years it has become apparent that receptor trafﬁcking through the endocytic system can also regulate integrin function [ 4 – 7 ] . In simple terms , cycles of endocytosis and re - exocytosis ( recycling ) can control the availability of integ - rins at the plasma membrane and , for some integrins , almost all of the surface pool of integrin is cleared within a time period of around 30 minutes . The degradative turnover of integrins is slow ( the half - life of surface - labelled integrins is 12 – 24 hours [ 8 – 11 ] ) , and hence the majority of internalised integrins are re - cycled [ 6 ] . Clearly , this tight regulation of the surface integrin population will impact upon integrin function , and compelling ev - idence implicates the various endocytic and recycling routes that control integrin trafﬁcking as critical regulators of cell migration , including in the context of haptotaxis , chemotaxis and invasive cell migration in 3D matrix . GTPases of the Rab and Arf family are key regulators of transit through the endolysosomal system and are themselves controlled by cycles of GTP binding , cata - lysed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , and GTP hydrolysis , catalysed by GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) . Rab GTPases recruit effector proteins to regulate cargo sorting , motor protein binding , tethering , docking and fusion events [ 12 ] , whilst the Arfs are associated with recruitment of coat proteins that control vesicle budding in addition to linking to motor proteins and regulating phospholipid signalling [ 13 , 14 ] . Some Rab and Arf GTPase effectors , and indeed some Rab proteins themselves , can interact directly with integrins , providing exquisite levels of control for a speciﬁed integrin and its co - cargoes . The molecular mechanisms that control integrin trafﬁcking in general have been reviewed in depth elsewhere [ 4 – 7 ] ; here , we will focus on the pathways that control integrin in - ternalisation and recycling in migrating cells . In the late 1980s and early 1990s , Mark Bretscher ﬁrst demon - strated , using biochemical techniques , that certain integrins are internalised from the cell surface and recycled back to the plasma membrane [ 15 , 16 ] . The hypothesis that cycles of inter - nalisation followed by recycling might serve to redistribute the pools of integrin from one part of the cell to another emerged from these studies and led to the idea that migrating cells must remove their integrin ‘feet’ from the rear of the cell for re - intro - duction towards the front of the cell to permit forward movement R1092 Current Biology 25 , R1092 – R1105 , November 16 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved [ 17 ] . Subsequent studies reported that integrins were indeed en - docytosed at the rear of neutrophils and recycled at the leading edge , as integrin - containing vesicles were observed at the cell rear and the cell front ; however , upon disruption of Ca 2 + signal - ling , the pool of integrin vesicles at the cell front was lost [ 18 , 19 ] . In ﬁbroblasts , integrin - containing vesicles were indeed found to internalise from the plasma membrane before delivery to the perinuclear recycling compartment , but long - range movement of recycling vesicles to the leading edge was not observed , and in fact endocytosis was seen to occur at membrane protru - sions as well as at the cell rear [ 20 – 22 ] . The hypothesis that integ - rins are internalised at the cell rear for recycling at the leading edge is attractive and remains popular despite a lack of clear evidence . In this review , we will present recent evidence indicating that trafﬁcking of integrins does occur directionally , but in surprising ways — from the cell front to the cell front , from the cell front to the cell rear , and from the perinuclear region to the cell rear — all of which contribute to cell motility . We will also discuss how in - ternalisation of integrins regulates the turnover of focal adhe - sions and promotes adhesion formation at the front of migrating cells in 2D . Finally , we will summarise the role of integrin traf - ﬁcking in cancer cell migration and invasion in more physiologi - cally relevant 3D microenvironments . Endocytosis of Integrins Facilitates Cell Migration Members of the integrin family have been shown to be internal - ised by macropinocytosis , clathrin - dependent endocytosis and clathrin - independent endocytosis , which includes endocytosis mediated by caveolae and clathrin - independent carriers ( CLICs ) [ 6 ] . Both inactive and active ( ligand - bound ) conformations of in - tegrin heterodimers can be internalised , and there is clear evi - dence that internalisation of integrins is an important step in the regulation of cell migration in both 2D and 3D ECM [ 23 , 24 ] . Cycles of adhesion assembly and disassembly are crucial to cell migration [ 25 ] , and in many cases integrin endocytosis has been linked to cell migration through the turnover of focal adhe - sions / focal complexes ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . Clathrin - dependent Endocytosis of Integrins Regulates Adhesion Turnover Targeting of adhesion complexes by microtubules is important in the destabilisation of cell – matrix contacts leading to adhesion turnover because it provides the tracks for vesicular transport delivering both matrix metalloproteases ( which cleave ECM and allow release of integrins from the immobile substrate ) and the molecular machinery that promotes integrin endocytosis , including dynamin - 2 ( Dyn2 ) [ 26 , 27 ] . The GTPase Dyn2 polymer - ises around the neck of budding vesicles to execute scission events [ 28 ] , such as during clathrin - and caveolar - mediated endocytosis , and binds directly to focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) [ 29 ] . FAK recruits Dyn2 in a Src - and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - dependent manner at or near adhesion sites to facilitate turnover of large focal adhesions that form in the presence of the microtubule - de - polymerising agent nocodazole and are induced to disassemble upon nocodazole washout [ 26 , 29 – 31 ] . The adaptors Dab2 , Eps8 and Numb have all been implicated in the regulation of clathrin - dependent endocytosis , and interact directly via their phospho - tyrosine - binding ( PTB ) domains with conserved NPxY / NxxY motifs within integrin b - subunit cytoplasmic tails [ 32 ] . Numb and Dab2 are clathrin adaptors that have been shown to localise at adhesion sites together with clathrin and dynamin to directly regulate integrin endocytosis and control adhesion turnover [ 26 , 29 , 30 , 33 , 34 ] . However , the precise mechanistic details of clathrin - dependent endocytosis of integrins appear to depend upon the localisation of adhesions and adhesion type to a large extent ( Figure 1 ) , although cell or tissue type may also be a fac - tor . Numb binds to b 1 and b 3 integrins and is found at the cell – substrate interface polarised towards the leading edge of migrating cells in a manner dependent on cycles of phosphory - lation and dephosphorylation by Par - 3 – atypical protein kinase C ( aPKC ) . Numb , together with the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 , regu - lates clathrin - dependent endocytosis of b 1 and b 3 integrins to promote turnover of adhesions at the leading edge and facilitate cell migration ( but not cell spreading ) on ligands for these integ - rins [ 33 ] . The kinesin family motor KIF15 is required for localisa - tion of Dab2 to the ventral surface of the cell to regulate integrin internalisation [ 35 ] , and Dab2 regulates microtubule - dependent adhesion turnover by promoting clathrin - dependent endocy - tosis of active b 1 integrins in conjunction with the clathrin adaptor ARH and / or AP - 2 [ 30 , 34 ] . In migrating cells Dab2 and ARH localise to large adhesions beneath the central region of the cell , rather than to focal complexes found at the leading edge ( as is the case for Numb [ 33 , 36 ] ) or adhesion structures to - ward the rear [ 34 ] . Clathrin - dependent endocytosis of integrins can also be regu - lated by Arf GTPases ; for example , the Arf6 GAP ARAP2 ( ArfGAP with RhoGAP domain , ankyrin repeat and PH domain 2 ) is required for b 1 - integrin internalisation and adhesion disas - sembly [ 37 ] . Furthermore , the Arf5 / Arf6 GEF BRAG2 ( brefeldin A - resistant ARF - GEF2 ) binds to clathrin and AP - 2 and activates Arf5 to promote internalisation of a 5 b 1 in cancer cells [ 38 , 39 ] and also regulates endothelial cell sprouting and angiogenesis [ 40 ] . The small GTPase Rab5 regulates vesicle formation and early endosome function , and is required for microtubule - dependent adhesion disassembly [ 41 ] . In endothelial cells , the Rab5 GEF Rin2 localises to adhesion complexes at the leading edge and within endosomes , and plays a clear role in the endocytosis of active b 1 integrins . In addition to its function as a Rab5 activator , Rin2 recruits R - Ras to the endosomal Rin2 – Rab5 complex to further promote integrin internalisation , activate Rac ( via its ex - change factor Tiam1 ) , and coordinate cell adhesion and migra - tion on ﬁbronectin substrates [ 42 ] . RN - tre , a Rab5 GAP , localises to adhesion complexes across the whole cell – substratum inter - face and inactivates Rab5 to suppress the internalisation of b 1 ( but not b 3 ) integrins to slow cell spreading and migration specif - ically on ﬁbronectin . RN - tre also forms a complex with Eps8 , an integrin interactor , and diverts Eps8 from its function as a Rac activator to a suppressor of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) endocytosis [ 43 ] . It is therefore tempting to speculate that , in large adhesions , RN - tre is recruited by an integrin - asso - ciated protein , such as Eps8 , to suppress Rab5 activity and slow adhesion turnover , whereas in nascent adhesion / focal com - plexes toward the cell front the presence of Rin2 provides an activation signal for Rab5 and promotes integrin endocytosis . This could also link Rab5 - dependent integrin endocytosis to the suppression of Rac activity toward the central region of migrating cells by maintaining large focal / ﬁbrillar adhesions , and to the activation of Rac ( via the R - Ras – Rin2 – Rab5 complex ) Current Biology 25 , R1092 – R1105 , November 16 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved R1093 Current Biology Review at the leading edge to promote lamellipodial extension . Rab21 , which is related to Rab5 and interacts directly with the a chain of b 1 integrins [ 44 ] , can promote the endocytosis of b 1 integrins in a manner insensitive to monodansyl cadaverine ( which inhibits clathrin - dependent endocytosis ) [ 45 ] , suggesting a form of cla - thrin - independent endocytosis . In addition , dominant - negative forms of Rab21 promote formation of large peripheral adhesions , indicative of a role in focal adhesion turnover [ 44 ] . Moreover , Rab21 promotes cell adhesion and migration on collagen , implying a role in trafﬁcking of collagen - binding integrins ( a 1 b 1 , a 2 b 1 , a 10 b 1 and a 11 b 1 ) [ 44 , 46 ] . In addition to controlling adhesion disassembly , clathrin - dependent endocytosis of integrins can , perhaps counterintui - tively , contribute to focal adhesion formation . Dab2 recruits Eps15 homology domain ( EHD ) proteins , which are accessory proteins involved in clathrin - dependent endocytosis , to specif - ically regulate the internalisation of inactive a 1 b 1 , a 2 b 1 and a 3 b 1 integrins ( but not transferrin receptor or a 5 b 1 integrin ) from the dorsal surface of the cell , to generate an internal pool of integrin that is subsequently recycled to form adhesions at the leading edge [ 36 , 47 ] . In this way , integrin internalisation can lead not only to disassembly of adhesions , but also to the generation of a pool of integrin that can be recycled for adhesion reassembly . Clathrin - independent Routes of Integrin Internalisation in Cell Migration In recent years , the relevance of CLICs to bulk endocytosis has become increasingly apparent . Interestingly , CLICs act as endo - cytic carriers of integrins and the hyaluronan receptor CD44 , and CLICs distribute toward the leading edge of migrating cells [ 48 , 49 ] . The biogenesis of CLICs at the plasma membrane requires glycosphingolipids , the N - glycan - binding protein galec - tin - 3 and GRAF1 ( GTPase regulator associated with FAK 1 ) [ 49 , 50 ] .

Hence , it is tempting to speculate that CLICs regulate the internalisation of adhesion re - ceptors at the leading edge of cells to facilitate cell migration , perhaps by controlling adhesion turnover and / or generating a pool of internal integrin for recycling ( Figure 2 ) . Caveolae are cholesterol - and sphingolipid - rich membrane microdomains that control clathrin - independent and dynamin - dependent internalisation of cargoes , including integrins . Cav - eolar function is associated with cell migration , although these endocytic structures often partition towards the rear of migrating cells [ 51 ] . PKC a regulates integrin internalisation and haptotac - tic cell migration [ 52 ] and has been linked to caveolar function [ 53 ] . Furthermore , PKC a can activate the formin FMNL2 to pro - mote direct binding of this formin to b 1 integrins and integrin in - ternalisation , although the dependence of this speciﬁc pathway on clathrin / caveolae is not known [ 54 ] . Integrin endocytosis via caveolae has been demonstrated [ 55 – 57 ] , and in some cases this contributes to cell migration . In ﬁbroblasts , the binding of Syndecan - 4 to ﬁbronectin ( at a site distinct from the integrin - binding sites ) triggers a signalling cascade , via PKC a and RhoG , which promotes caveolar endocytosis of b 1 integrins [ 58 ] . This allows redeployment of the integrin elsewhere around the cell surface , and promotes 2D cell migration as well as wound healing in vivo [ 58 ] . Caveolar endocytosis of LFA - 1 ( a L b 2 integrin ) is thought to occur in the trailing uropod of leukocytes migrating on the LFA - 1 ligand ICAM - 1 , and this requires the adhesion molecule JAM - A [ 59 , 60 ] . Interestingly , this trafﬁcking pathway is regulated by G - protein - coupled receptor ( GPCR ) signalling , as G a q / 11 gene silencing abrogates LFA - 1 internalisation , uropod detachment and leukocyte migration [ 61 ] .

Current Biology 25 , R1092 – R1105 , November 16 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved R1095 Current Biology Review a 5 b 1 integrin can also be internalised through a mechanism dependent on the SCAR / WAVE actin nucleation complex and Arf4 that does not require clathrin or dynamin and therefore rep - resents a distinct route of internalisation for ligand - bound integ - rins [ 62 ] . In Rab25 - expressing cancer cells , active integrins are rapidly internalised from sub - nuclear adhesions ( originating from tensin - dependent translocation of peripheral adhesions ) into late endosomes / lysosomes which contact adhesion sites in an Arf4 - dependent manner . Arf4 is generally associated with Golgi transport and could therefore play an indirect role in deliv - ery of cargos that mediate endocytosis [ 13 ] . However , tensin can associate with Arf4 [ 62 ] , so it is possible that Arf4 functions outside of the secretory pathway in a deﬁned endocytic capac - ity , as is the case for Arf5 ( another class II Arf family member [ 39 ] ) . Delivery of ligand - bound integrins to lysosomes activates mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) , links integrin trafﬁcking to the nutrient status of cancer cells , and impacts on invasive migration and metastasis [ 62 ] . Interestingly , the putative onco - gene tensin - 4 does not localise to ﬁbrillar adhesions , but sup - presses b 1 - integrin endocytosis and provides a link to c - Met sig - nalling and invasion [ 63 ] . Macropinocytosis can also play an important role in the rapid redistribution of integrins in growth - factor - stimulated ﬁbro - blasts . Platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) stimulates the for - mation of circular dorsal rufﬂes , which accumulate b 1 and b 3 in - tegrins from the dorsal surface of the cell before they are taken up by macropinocytosis . Again , an increase in integrin uptake creates an internal pool that can subsequently be recycled and promote formation of new adhesions at the leading edge [ 64 ] . From Endosomes to Plasma Membrane : Recycling Integrins Promote Migration Many studies over the last 15 years have linked integrin recycling to the ability of cells to move on 2D surfaces ( Table 1 ) [ 7 ] . The ﬁrst identiﬁcations of the molecular machinery involved in integ - rin trafﬁcking directly implicated these components in the regu - lation of cell spreading and cell migration [ 65 – 69 ] , and an in - depth interrogation of the role of protein kinase D1 ( PKD1 ) in a v b 3 - integrin recycling showed that this kinase was required for the formation of focal contacts found at the leading edge of migrating cells [ 70 ] . Much of the recent work has hinged upon identifying key integrin - speciﬁc regulators of recycling pathways that form the basis for intervention . In a similar manner to endo - cytosis , integrin recycling is thought to regulate adhesive capac - ity , through maintenance of existing , and formation of new , cell – matrix adhesions . However , trafﬁcking of integrins can also alter signalling downstream of other receptors to promote cell migra - tion , which may be distinct from the adhesive function of integ - rins in adhesion complexes [ 71 , 72 ] . The pathways that regulate integrin recycling in migrating cells are summarised in Table 1 . Like many other cargoes , internalised integrins enter early en - dosomes and the fate of the receptor depends upon sorting de - cisions that determine onward trafﬁcking to late endosomes / ly - sosomes , or recycling back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes or alternative routes [ 14 ] . The binding of sorting nexins ( SNX ) 17 and 31 to a conserved motif in the b - in - tegrin subunit is crucial for diverting integrins away from a degra - dative route toward recycling [ 11 , 73 – 75 ] . Similarly , the Arp2 / 3 activator WASH is required to direct a 5 b 1 integrin away from a late endosomal destination and toward a recycling route [ 76 ] . Whilst integrins can follow the late endosome / lysosomal route to destruction [ 8 – 10 ] , autophagosomes may also play a role in degradation of b 1 integrins [ 77 ] . The best characterised integ - rin - recycling routes are analogous to the fast ( short - loop ) and slow ( long - loop ) pathways that control trafﬁcking of other recep - tors [ 78 ] . Importantly , integrins are often speciﬁcally recruited into these routes by virtue of protein – protein interactions with trafﬁcking regulators , and some of these are speciﬁc sub - path - ways that handle the recycling of integrins ( and their co - cargoes ) but not other cell - surface receptors . Recycling from Early Endosomes The Rab4 short - loop or fast recycling pathway selectively con - trols recycling of integrins in cells stimulated with growth factors or serum [ 6 ] . The mechanism through which speciﬁc integrin het - erodimers are recruited is incompletely understood , but entry into this sorting compartment is controlled by Rabaptin - 5 , which binds the Rab5 GEF Rabex - 5 to promote Rab5 activity on early endosomes [ 79 , 80 ] . Rabaptin - 5 also acts to functionally link Rab5 and Rab4 [ 81 ] and is a substrate for PKD , with PKD - medi - ated phosphorylation controlling the formation of a Rab4 – Ra - baptin - 5 complex and rapid recycling of a v b 3 integrin [ 79 ] . Inter - estingly , PKD1 binds directly to the b subunit of a v b 3 to control its recycling , and phosphorylation of Rabaptin - 5 may control recruitment of Rab4 to subdomains of early endosomes that harbour a v b 3 to permit integrin recycling directly from this compartment [ 65 , 70 , 79 , 82 ] . This pathway is required for the incorporation of a v b 3 integrin into newly forming adhesions at the lamellipodial leading edge of cells , and drives directionally persistent migration of cells on 2D substrates and invasive migration in 3D matrices with low levels of ﬁbronectin [ 70 , 79 , 82 ] . Studies in ﬁbroblasts and endothelial cells showed that a v b 3 , but not a 5 b 1 , follows this growth - factor - driven recycling itinerary [ 65 , 83 , 84 ] , butmorerecentevidencesuggeststhatother b 1 - con - taining integrins can also recycle in a Rab4 - dependent fashion . For example , an imaging - based approach showed that inactive b 1 integrins can follow this route [ 85 ] , and others have shown that supervillin , which binds both to actin and to cholesterol - rich lipid rafts , also regulates recycling of b 1 and b 3 integrins [ 86 ] . Rabenosyn - 5 , a Rab5 effector , and Vps45 ( which interacts with the SNARE machinery ) are also involved in the recycling of b 1 integrins , likely via this route [ 87 ] . Furthermore , Rab5c pro - motes the formation of a complex between the Arf6 effector AMAP1 , PKD2 and the b 1 cytoplasmic tail of a 2 b 1 and a 3 b 1 ( but not a 5 b 1 ) , which regulates recycling of these b 1 integrins in cancer cell lines and promotes cell migration and invasion [ 88 ] . It therefore appears that aspects of the recycling of integrins from early endosomes — the requirement for Rab4 / Rab5 and the involvement of PKD family members — are conserved in different cell types , but that the details —the PKD family member andthespeciﬁcintegrinheterodimer—mayvary . Nevertheless , it isclearthattheearlyendosomalrecyclingofintegrinscontributes to the directionally persistent migration of ﬁbroblasts ( by promot - ingformationofnewadhesionsattheleadinglamellipodia ) aswell as the migratory and invasive properties of cancer cells . The Perinuclear Recycling Compartment The perinuclear recycling compartment is characterised by the presence of Rab11 , although other GTPases ( Rab8 , Rab22a and Arf6 ) also play a role in this slow recycling route [ 78 ] .

Some elements of the recycling machinery in this compartment are common between integrins and other cargoes , for example the EHD proteins [ 91 ] , whilst other components appear to show selectivity toward integrins . For instance , the Rab11 effector Rab - coupling protein ( RCP ) associates with a 5 b 1 integrin and regulates its recycling in migrating cells [ 71 , 92 ] . PKC ε phosphorylates vimentin to release collagen - and ﬁbronectin - binding b 1 integrins from perinuclear intermedi - ate ﬁlaments and control motility [ 67 , 68 ] , and p120RasGAP dis - places Rab21 from internalised integrins to control b 1 - integrin z x z x z x y z x y x y x Focal contacts / nascent adhesions Focal contacts / nascent adhesions Microtubules Directional migration Directional migration Directional migration Forward movement of rear Src activity KIF1C PNRC Ca 2 + / calcineurin Focaladhesions Focaladhesions ECM + - Neutrophils Rear - steering epithelial cells Cancer cells in 3D ECM : Rab25 and CLIC3 Rab25 Rab25 ECM ECM Plasma membrane and macropinosomes Early endosomes Recycling endosomes Lysosomes Activation Traffickingroutes Inhibition Activeintegrin Inactiveintegrin α 5 β 1 integrin α v β 3 integrin Current Biology A B C CLIC3 - positive lysosome Figure3 . Directionaltrafﬁckingofintegrins . ( A ) In neutrophils , integrins are internalised at the rear of the migrating cell and recycled to the leading edge via the perinuclear recycling compartment ( PNRC ) , in a process that is dependent upon calcium signalling . ( B ) In rear - steering epithelial cells , the kinesin KIF1C drives the movement of integrin - containing vesicles from the perinuclear region along microtubules to the tip of the trailing cell tail . This allows maturation of adhesions at the rear of the cell , providing direc - tionality towards guidance cues and promotes persistent migration . ( C ) In cancer cells migrating in 3D ECM , a 5 b 1 integrins are internalised at the leading edge and sorted into Rab25 - positive en - dosomes ; inactive integrins return to the plasma membrane at the cell front , whereas active in - tegrins are trafﬁcked to chloride intracellular channel 3 ( CLIC3 ) - positive lysosomes . Subse - quent recycling of active integrins to the cell rear and an increase in Src activity drive forward movement . recycling and cell migration [ 93 ] . Simi - larly , PKB / Akt - mediated phosphorylation of the Arf6 GAP ACAP1 controls its inter - action with b 1 integrins to regulate Arf6 – Rab11 - dependent recycling of integrins and migration towards ﬁbronectin [ 69 , 94 , 95 ] . The Arf GEF ARNO / cytohesin 2 is also required for b 1 - integrin recycling to promote cell migration [ 96 , 97 ] , and it is likely that Arf6 acts together with the pathways described above to form distinct steps on a common route con - trolling integrin trafﬁcking in motile cells . Directional Transport of Integrins in Migrating Cells The attractive hypothesis that integrins are internalised at the cell rear and re - cycled at the leading edge has persisted despite a lack of convincing evidence across multiple cell types . Whilst it is intu - itive that this occurs to some extent in migrating cells , and evidence has been put forward that this occurs in neutrophils ( Figure 3A ) [ 18 , 19 ] , it is clear that much of the turnover of adhesion complexes ( and hence internalisation of integrins ) occurs at the front of migrating cells and that the recycling of integrins contributes to formation of adhesion complexes at the leading edge . In dividing cells , vesicular integ - rins move from the cleavage furrow to the leading edge to facil - itate re - spreading and movement of daughter cells away from each other [ 45 ] , but evidence for this en masse movement to the leading edge of conventionally migrating cells has not been forthcoming ; in fact , spatially restricted cycles of internalisation and recycling have been observed ( Figure 3C ) [ 90 , 98 ] . Two recent studies have shown that , surprisingly , long - distance in - tegrin trafﬁcking can be directed towards the cell rear , and this has important consequences for migration in both 2D and 3D ( Figure 3B , C ) . R1098 Current Biology 25 , R1092 – R1105 , November 16 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Current Biology Review In migrating epithelial cells , the kinesin KIF1C controls the movement of a 5 b 1 - integrin - containing vesicles along microtu - bules from the perinuclear region to the distal tip of the trailing cell tail , rather than forward to the leading edge . This rearward trafﬁcking promotes the maturation of adhesions that anchor the tail , allowing the cell to orient towards guidance cues and move in a directionally persistent manner through this ‘rear - steering’ mechanism [ 99 ] . In invasive cancer cells migrating in 3D ECM , active a 5 b 1 integrins are endocytosed at the cell front and sorted within Rab25 endosomes for retrograde trafﬁcking to late endosomes / lysosomes in the cell body . Active integrins are subsequently recycled to the plasma membrane at the cell rear to facilitate forward movement of the trailing end [ 10 ] . Reciprocal Recycling : a v b 3 vs . a 5 b 1 Integrins Many integrin recycling routes have been determined for b 1 in - tegrins , which can form 12 distinct heterodimer receptors for a variety of ligands . However , several studies have focused on the recycling of speciﬁc heterodimers ( Table 1 ) , and accumu - lating evidence has demonstrated an antagonistic relationship between the recycling of a v b 3 and a 5 b 1 that inﬂuences cell migration in 2D and 3D microenvironments . The Rab4 short - loop recycling pathway controls recycling of a v b 3 , but not a 5 b 1 [ 65 ] . The transit of a v b 3 through the Rab4 re - cycling route requires direct interaction of PKD1 with the b 3 sub - unit and PKD1 - dependent phosphorylation of Rabaptin - 5 [ 70 , 79 , 82 ] . Recycling through this route promotes formation of a v b 3 - integrin - containing cell – matrix adhesions at the leading edge , which in turn supports Rac - and Arp2 / 3 - mediated lamelli - podial extension to maintain directionally persistent migration of ﬁbroblasts and cancer cells in 2D [ 70 , 79 , 82 , 100 ] . Interestingly , disruption of Rab4 – a v b 3 recycling , by direct inhi - bition of a v b 3 or abrogation of a v b 3 recycling ( for example , via mutations in PKD1 , b 3 integrin or Rabaptin - 5 ) , causes lamellipo - dial collapse and promotes a rapid random mode of migration as cells move on 2D substrates [ 71 , 82 , 101 ] . This is due to an increase in the Rab11 – RCP - dependent recycling of a 5 b 1 integ - rin , which promotes activation of the RhoA – ROCK – coﬁlin pathway , generating rufﬂing protrusions that drive rapid random migration [ 71 , 82 , 101 ] . Syndecan - 4 plays a key role in the trafﬁcking of cell - surface receptors , including integrins [ 102 ] . Src - dependent phosphory - lation of Syndecan - 4 promotes the recruitment of the adaptor protein Syntenin to suppress Arf6 activity and consequently a 5 b 1 - integrin recycling via this route , whereas slow recycling of a v b 3 is maintained to promote directional migration . Non - phosphorylatable Syndecan - 4 mutants ( or a fast - cycling Arf6 mutant ) promote recycling of a 5 b 1 , suppressing a v b 3 recycling and leading to rapid adhesion turnover but decreased cell migra - tion [ 103 ] . These studies suggest that the relationships between integrin heterodimers are more complex than previously thought , and the reciprocity between a v b 3 and a 5 b 1 deﬁnes the signalling that underpins migratory strategies in 2D ( directionally persistent versus random ) . Integrin Trafﬁcking in Migration and Invasion in 3D Cell migration in physiologically relevant 3D environments has become the focus of intense research in recent years . Interest - ingly , focal adhesions are sites of matrix degradation , and the FAK / dynamin adhesion disassembly factors targeted directly by microtubules are also thought to promote delivery of prote - ases , such as membrane - type 1 matrix metalloproteinase ( MT1 - MMP ) [ 27 , 104 , 105 ] . Trafﬁcking of MT1 - MMP is critically important in the context of 3D migration , and MT1 - MMP is directed from late endosomes to the plasma membrane [ 106 – 109 ] . Whilst the relationship between integrins and MT1 - MMP is unclear in the context of a 3D ECM , it is tempting to speculate that some degree of cooperativity and coordination underlies the interrelated function of both ECM receptor and ECM degrader . Integrin endocytosis is an important event regulating the ability of cancer cells to invade ; for example , HS1 - associated protein X - 1 ( HAX - 1 ) , a ubiquitously expressed adaptor protein and regu - lator of cell migration , controls the clathrin - dependent endocy - tosis of a v b 6 integrin to facilitate organotypic invasion [ 110 ] . Furthermore , the formin FMNL2 interacts with the a chains of b 1 integrins when activated by PKC a and RhoC , to promote integrin internalisation and invasion of melanoma cells [ 54 ] , and a similar mechanism may also promote trafﬁcking of a 5 b 1 to increase invasion of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells [ 111 ] . Recycling pathways have also been shown to mediate inva - sive migration ; for example , hypoxia promotes migration of cancer cells in Matrigel (cid:2) transwell assays by mobilising Rab11 - dependent a 6 b 4 recycling [ 112 ] , and mobilisation of a 3 b 1 integrin via Arf6 – AMAP1 can similarly induce invasive migration of breast cancer cells [ 88 ] . a v b 3 and a 5 b 1 integrins have both been implicated in invasive migration of cancer cells , but the inverse relationship between these heterodimers observed in 2D is also translated in 3D . a v b 3 recycling via the Rab4 – Rabaptin - 5 – PKD1 pathway promotes migration and inva - sion in ECM when ﬁbronectin levels are low or absent , by inducing lamellipodial - type migration and invasion ( Figure 4A ) [ 79 ] . Abrogation of a v b 3 recycling or gene silencing / inhibition of a v b 3 ( using small - molecule inhibitors , e . g . cilengitide and cRGDfV , or soluble ligands copiously produced by tumours e . g . osteopontin ) has a matrix - speciﬁc effect on invasive migra - tion , inhibiting invasion into low - ﬁbronectin environments but promoting invasion in ﬁbronectin - rich ECM , given that a v b 3 in - tegrin suppresses the recycling of the major receptor for ﬁbro - nectin , a 5 b 1 ( Figure 4 ; discussed below ) [ 71 , 79 ] . RCP - driven a 5 b 1 Recycling in Cancer Cell Invasion and Metastasis Gain - of - function forms of mutant p53 ( p53 mut ; e . g . 175H , 273H ) are known to promote metastasis in mouse models [ 85 , 92 , 113 – 115 ] . These forms of mutant p53 act to suppress expression of the ribonuclease Dicer , in some cases through p63 inhibition , and thereby lead to lowered levels of speciﬁc mature micro - RNAs that inﬂuence invasive migration and metastasis [ 116 , 117 ] . The p53 mut – Dicer pathway controls a 5 b 1 integrin re - cycling by regulating the recruitment of this integrin to RCP and , as a consequence , controls the migratory strategy of can - cer cells in 2D and increases invasion into ﬁbronectin - rich 3D ECM ( Figure 4 ) [ 92 , 117 , 118 ] . Interestingly , a mechanistically similar pathway is controlled by a v b 3 integrin , which inhibits the recruitment of a 5 b 1 to RCP , thus preventing recycling of this integrin . Surprisingly , cells that rapidly recycle a 5 b 1 integrin through the RCP pathway do not show enhanced adhesion [ 71 ] , and Current Biology 25 , R1092 – R1105 , November 16 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved R1099 Current Biology Review therefore changes in adhesive properties do not explain the enhanced invasive capacity of cells into ﬁbronectin - rich ECM . The RCP – a 5 b 1 complex is able to recruit receptor tyrosine ki - nases ( RTKs ) , including EGFR , ErbB2 and c - Met ( [ 71 , 92 , 118 ] and P . T . Caswell unpublished data ) . Together , RCP and a 5 b 1 in - tegrin coordinate the recycling of RTKs and potentiate down - stream signalling [ 71 , 92 , 118 ] . In cells moving through 3D ECM , diacylglycerol kinase ( DGK ) - a produces phosphatidic acid to re - cruit RCP - containing vesicles to the tips of invasive pseudopods extending into the 3D matrix [ 101 ] , and this creates a local signal through Akt / PKB to promote the recruitment of RacGAP1 to the cytoskeletal scaffold protein IQGAP1 [ 119 ] . RacGAP1 directly in - activates Rac and allows activation of RhoA speciﬁcally at the front of cells moving in 3D ECM [ 119 ] . RhoA in turn promotes ROCK - dependent activation of the formin FHOD3 , which drives the formation of ﬁlopodial actin spike protrusions , rather than la - mellipodia , to mediate invasive migration in 3D ECM and in vivo ( Figure 4 ) [ 120 ] . Interestingly , p53 mut promotes the expression of myosin X , a molecular motor that promotes ﬁlopodia formation and transports integrin to the tips of ﬁlopodia , suggesting that in - tegrin trafﬁcking and ﬁlopodia formation may be directly coordi - nated in this context [ 121 ] . Late Endosomes , Lysosomes and Rescued Integrins The role of late endosomes and lysosomes in delivery of cargoes to regulate cell migration is becoming increasingly apparent .

Integrin recycling in cancer cell invasion . ( A ) In 3D ECM with a low ﬁbronectin content , trafﬁcking of a v b 3 integrin promotes invasion , presumably through redistribution of this integrin to the leading edge resulting in high Rac activity and lamellipodial - like protrusions . However , a v b 3 ( and a v b 3 recycling ) , or expression of miRNAs through Dicer , suppress the association of a 5 b 1 with RCP . This results in low levels of invasion in the presence of the a 5 b 1 ligand ﬁbronectin . ( B ) In 3D ECM with a high ﬁbronectin content , when a v b 3integrin isinhibitedwithsmall cyclicpeptides or soluble ligands such as osteopontin , or when mutant p53 inhibits p63 and Dicer , a 5 b 1 integrin is recruited by RCP and rapidly recycled to the plasma membrane . This is coordinated by diac - ylglycerol kinase ( DGK ) - a which produces phos - phatidic acid ( PA ) from diacylglycerol ( DAG ) to recruit RCP - containing vesicles to the pseudopo - dial tip . RCP and a 5 b 1 integrin recruit RTKs , such as EGFR , and promote their trafﬁcking and lo - calised signalling . This drives PKB / Akt - mediated phosphorylationofRacGAP1 , whichisrecruitedto the scaffold IQGAP and inhibits Rac . This in turn allows localised RhoA activity , which drives the formation of actin spikes and bundles through ROCK - mediated activation of FHOD3 . Whilst integrin targeting to lysosomes can lead to degradation , integrin ligands such as ﬁbronectin are targeted from late endosomes / lysosomes to the cell surface to promote migration and inva - sion [ 122 , 123 ] . Additionally , signalling coordinated by the scaffold protein p14 - MP1 at late endosomes has been impli - cated in focal adhesion organisation in 2D [ 124 ] . More evidence for the role of late endosomes / lyso - somes in the positive regulation of integrin function has been determined from studies of cancer cell invasion . Rab25 is a Rab11 family member that binds directly to the b 1 - integrin cyto - plasmic tail to regulate trafﬁcking of a 5 b 1 , and as a conse - quence of this can promote migration and invasion in ﬁbro - nectin - rich ECM [ 98 ] . Rab25 has been described as both an oncogene and tumour suppressor ; its contribution to tumouri - genesis is cancer - type and context speciﬁc [ 125 ] . Rab25 - containing vesicles localise to the tips of pseudopods as cells migrate in 3D ECM , and sort internalised inactive a 5 b 1 for recy - cling to the cell front , which re - engages the ECM to promote protrusion [ 10 , 98 ] . Interestingly , Rab25 sorts active a 5 b 1 back towards the cell body through late endosomes to chloride intra - cellular channel 3 ( CLIC3 ) - positive lysosomes , and CLIC3 pre - vents degradation of this integrin by facilitating recycling back to the plasma membrane [ 10 ] . This pathway activates Src signal - ling and promotes forward movement of the rear of the cell to in - crease invasive migration , whereas in the absence of CLIC3 a 5 b 1 is degraded and cell motility is abrogated ; CLIC3 levels may therefore dictate the contribution of Rab25 to tumourigen - esis . Rab25 - positive late endosomes collect internalised a 5 b 1 from tensin - positive adhesions for the delivery of integrin – ligand complexes to lysosomes , which recruits and activates mTORC1 , whilst nutrient deprivation promotes internalisation R1100 Current Biology 25 , R1092 – R1105 , November 16 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved Current Biology Review of active integrin – ligand complexes to lysosomes . This link to lysosomal signalling suggests that integrin trafﬁcking supports a favourable bioenergetic proﬁle in addition to controlling integ - rin trafﬁcking in invasive cancer cells [ 62 ] . Future Perspectives Whilst studies of integrin trafﬁcking have given new insight into both integrin function and mechanisms of cell motility , particu - larly in 3D ECM , several questions remain incompletely answered and recent studies have opened further avenues for investigation . The relationship between RTK signalling and integ - rin trafﬁcking is fascinating yet complex ; for example , growth factor stimulation can lead to changes in integrin internalisation and recycling [ 65 , 126 ] , integrin – RTK co - trafﬁcking potentiates signalling [ 71 , 118 ] , and integrin – tensin - 4 complexes suppress RTK endocytosis to perhaps localise and / or enhance signalling [ 63 ] . How these activities are coordinated will help to reveal how the complex spatiotemporal signalling of such pathways is integrated within a migrating cell . It is clear that trafﬁcking of integrins inﬂuences adhesion formation / turnover and is likely to affect signalling from adhesion complexes . However , compart - ments within the endo - lysosomal system are known to act as signalling hubs [ 127 ] , and how integrin trafﬁcking might be involved in coordinating signalling from intracellular compart - ments is now beginning to be uncovered [ 62 ] . Furthermore , the activation status of trafﬁcking integrins is still somewhat contro - versial , but a consensus is emerging that integrins can indeed be transported into and through the endo - lysosomal system in inac - tive ( closed ) as well as active ( extended / primed ) conformations [ 7 , 24 ] ; however , whether integrins directly promote signals from endocytic compartments by virtue of their activation status is as yet unclear . Tools and techniques have been developed to precisely map localisation of trafﬁcking events ; for example , photoactivatable GFP has been used to monitor internalisation [ 62 , 128 ] and recycling [ 10 , 76 , 98 , 128 ] . These approaches need to be developed for use alongside biosensors , together with su - per - resolution microscopy , to reveal micro - and nanoscale orga - nisation of cell systems through endocytic trafﬁcking of speciﬁc cargoes , avoiding the caveats associated with biochemical techniques , which capture an average across populations . Furthermore , whilst we are beginning to understand the func - tional relevance of integrin trafﬁcking in physiological 3D con - texts , recent studies have revealed the dynamics of integrin trafﬁcking in vivo within the Drosophila myotendinous junction [ 129 – 131 ] . The next challenge is to visualise integrin trafﬁcking in cells migrating within in vivo contexts , including develop - mental processes and cancer cell invasion and metastasis , to fully comprehend both how the endocytic trafﬁcking of these compelling cargoes controls cell motility within multicellular or - ganisms , and how they can be targeted in the future for thera - peutic beneﬁt .
