204 Endocytosis of ligand - activated receptors has generally been considered a mechanism to attenuate signaling . There is now a growing body of evidence suggesting that this process is much more sophisticated and that endocytic membrane trafficking regulates both the intensity of signaling and the co - localization of activated receptors with downstream signaling molecules .

Among the diverse cellular responses to lig - and - mediated signaling events are the uptake of nutrients and ions , the regulation of protein and DNA synthesis , and decisions about the proliferation or death of the cell . These responses are triggered when intracellular signaling mole - cules are activated or generated through signaling pathways initiated by ligand - bound cell surface receptors . However , it remains poorly understood how these resultant signaling pathways are regulated to form a co - ordinated , receptor - spe - cific response . A cell can express a variety of cell surface receptors , which utilize a limited number of directed and regulated signaling pathways ; yet each receptor produces a distinct response in cell physiology . The interactions of acti - vated cell surface receptors with downstream effectors needed to amplify and transduce biochemical signals are governed by such diverse cellular processes as membrane trafficking , compartmentalization and regulated protein expression . This review focuses on the interplay between membrane trafficking and signaling by cell surface recep - tors . We discuss how membrane trafficking regulates signal transduction and how signaling events , in turn , regulate dis - tinct steps in membrane trafficking . Caveolae as coordinators of signaling molecules One well - studied example of compartmentalized signaling occurs from caveolae , which are morphologically defined as ‘omega’ - shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane . Biochemically , these membrane domains are defined by their association with a family of cholesterol - binding pro - teins called caveolins , which function to establish and / or maintain these structures . Caveolae constitute microdomains of the plasma membrane that are enriched in cholesterol , glycosphingolipids and lipid - anchored membrane proteins . With over 30 membrane receptors , signaling molecules and membrane transporters localized to caveolae , these lipid - and protein - dense cell surface microdomains are natural candidates for centers of signal - ing activity ( reviewed in [ 1 ] ) . Recent compelling evidence that caveolae are signaling centers comes from analysis of the direct consequences of modulating endogenous levels of caveolin or interfering with caveolin function in signaling . For instance , using an antisense strategy to inhibit the expression of caveolin - 1 in NIH - 3T3 cells causes their transformation by facilitating anchorage - independent growth and hyperactivation of extracellular regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK 1 / 2 ) [ 2 ] . Signaling through these pathways was restored when cave - olin - 1 returned to endogenous levels . Correspondingly , overexpression of caveolin - 1 suppresses ERK 1 / 2 signaling [ 3 ] . Caveolin overexpression does not have an inhibitory effect on all signaling pathways . The expression of recom - binant caveolin - 1 in NIH - 3T3 cells causes an increase in phospholipase D1 ( PLD1 ) activity [ 4 ] . A more striking example of the specificity of caveolae - dependent signaling events is the finding that the disruption of caveolin function or caveolae structure , caused either by overexpression of dominant - negative caveolin - 3 mutants or by depletion of cellular cholesterol , interferes with the activation of the protein kinase raf by activated H - ras without affecting its activation by the almost identical isoform K - ras [ 5 • ] . The difference between these two ras isoforms is their localization at the plasma membrane : H - ras , but not K - ras , is palmitylated , a modification that targets it to the cholesterol - rich lipid microdomains associated with caveolin . A functional rela - tionship between caveolin expression and cholesterol was also observed in Caenorhabditis elegans , in which either reduction of caveolin expression by RNA interference or depletion of cholesterol perturbs ras signaling through the MAP kinase pathway [ 6 • ] . The dramatic and diverse effects that caveolin function has on regulating signaling molecules are probably the result of using extreme measures to manipulate a system Regulation of signal transduction by endocytosis Brian P Ceresa and Sandra L Schmid CBC206 . QXD 02 / 24 / 2000 01 : 54 Page 204 Regulation of signal transduction by endocytosis Ceresa and Schmid 205 that is , under normal conditions , more delicately balanced by much smaller changes in caveolin function . In NIH - 3T3 and Rat1 cells , mutationally activated c - erbB2 ( c - neu ) causes the downregulation of caveolin - 1 , but not caveolin - 2 [ 7 ] . These decidedly more subtle changes are probably part of a complex feedback mechanism to regu - late transformation potential under prolonged growth factor stimulation . The exact role of caveolin and caveolae remains enigmat - ic . There is good evidence that they play direct roles in regulating plasma membrane cholesterol levels [ 8 ] . Although caveolae are clearly regions enriched with signal - ing proteins , it remains uncertain whether these structures function to spatially coordinate signaling events or whether there exists a more direct role for cholesterol and mem - brane subdomain composition itself in controlling the activity of signaling complexes . Endocytosis as a regulator of signal transduction Ligand - mediated endocytosis is characteristically an early response in the signaling pathways triggered by a diverse group of cell surface receptors , including heterotrimeric guanine - nucleotide - binding protein ( G protein ) - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) , receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) and cytokine receptors [ 9 , 10 ] . Upon binding of the ligand ( hor - mone , neuropeptide , growth factor , odorant , etc . ) to its cognate cell surface signaling receptor , the activated receptors are targeted to clathrin - coated membrane invagi - nations , which , through a series of highly regulated , yet still not fully understood , biochemical events , eventually pinch off to form a clathrin - coated vesicle . Subsequent membrane fusion and budding reactions deliver the con - tents of the vesicle through sequential endosomal compartments . During progression along the endocytic pathway , the endosomes are modified in protein composi - tion and pH , and their contents are sorted for shipment to the appropriate cellular destination . Among these fates are retention in the endosomal compartment , recycling back to the plasma membrane and delivery toward a lysosomal degradation pathway . Ligand - mediated endocytosis plays at least two functions in receptor signaling . First , it can serve as a biophysical mechanism for attenuating the signaling of an activated cell surface receptor . Discussed in this review is the evolv - ing story of the ErbB RTK family , which illustrates how controlled receptor trafficking regulates the potency of mitogenic signaling . Second , endocytosis plays a role in placing the activated cell surface receptor in the appropri - ate cellular location to interact with downstream signaling molecules . Signaling to ERK 1 / 2 by the internalized b 2 adrenergic receptor ( b 2 AR ) and the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor ( EGFR ) not only demonstrates this phenomena but also provides insight into how these inter - actions might be regulated . Endocytosis as a means of regulating receptor activity An excellent example of how endocytic membrane traf - ficking can regulate signaling comes from studies on the ErbB family of RTKs . ErbB family members , including the EGFR ( ErbB1 ) , are activated upon dimerization induced by binding their ligands , which are EGF , trans - forming growth factor - a ( TGF - a ) and Neu differentiation factor ( NDF ) . The specific ligand determines the compo - sition of the dimeric receptor ( Figure 1 ) . It has been appreciated for some time that different ErbB receptor ligands invoke different signaling potencies , par - ticularly in terms of their mitogenic potential [ 11 ] . This has been convincingly demonstrated and mechanistically explored by stably transfecting cells lacking ErbB family members with ErbB1 alone or in combination with either ErbB2 or ErbB3 [ 12 • ] . Cells expressing only ErbB1 were less proliferative in response to EGF than in response to TGF - a . When either ErbB2 or ErbB3 was co - expressed with ErbB1 , the cells became significantly more respon - sive to EGF , without altering their response to TGF - a . These increases in mitogenic response correlate with the increased recycling and decreased downregulation of ErbB1 homodimers that occur in the presence of TGF - a or when ErbB2 - or ErbB3 - containing heterodimers are activated by either EGF or TGF - a . As implied by these results , endosome sorting is regulated by interaction with both lumenal and cytoplasmic domains of the ErbB family members . Two lines of evidence sug - gest that endosome acidification and the pH - dependent dissociation of receptor – ligand complexes are central in controlling this sorting decision . First , TGF - a and NDF dissociate from their receptors at a relatively higher pH than EGF , suggesting that this dissociation would occur in early endosomal compartments , which are involved in receptor recycling . Second , treating cells with the ionophore monensin , which increases the pH of endoso - mal sorting compartments , leads to increased downregulation of receptors activated with TGF - a and NDF [ 12 • , 13 • ] . Studies with chimaeric receptors encoding the ligand - binding extracellular domain of ErbB1 and the intracellular domain of ErbB2 [ 14 ] or other ErbB family members [ 15 ] indicate that sorting signals in the ErbB1 cytoplasmic domain are required for receptor degradation . One candidate molecule that may recognize sorting determi - nants in ErbB1 is c - Cbl or its C . elegans ortholog Sli - 1 . c - Cbl has been shown to be a downstream substrate and negative regulator of a number of cell surface receptors , although its mechanism has been poorly understood [ 16 , 17 ] . Levkowitz et al . [ 18 ] found that c - Cbl is recruited to endosomes in cells transiently expressing the lysosomally directed ErbB1 , but not the recycling ErbB3 . c - Cbl is required for ligand - depen - dent ubiquitination of ErbB1 in endosomes , a modification that may target the protein to the lysosome degradative path - way . Importantly , mutants of either the ErbB1 RTK or c - Cbl CBC206 . QXD 02 / 24 / 2000 01 : 54 Page 205 that disrupt their interactions [ 18 , 19 , 20 •• ] result in decreased ErbB1 degradation and increased mitogenic signaling [ 19 ] ( Figure 2a ) . Results using other cell surface signaling recep - tors suggest a general role for ubiquitination in regulating endocytic membrane trafficking [ 21 ] . Pathophysiological consequences of receptor tyrosine kinase trafficking The physiological significance of differential RTK traf - ficking has been demonstrated by studies utilizing cultured breast cancer cell lines expressing varying ratios of endogenous ErbB1 and ErbB2 RTKs . Through a series of biochemical and immunocytochemical studies , Wang et al . [ 22 • ] demonstrate that , despite auto - tyrosine - phospho - rylation of both family members upon EGF treatment , endocytosis of dimeric receptor complexes is inversely pro - portional to ErbB2 expression . The physiological consequence of the differential cellular trafficking is increased mitogenic signaling owing to the prolonged acti - vation state of ligand – receptor complexes involving ErbB2 or ErbB3 subunits [ 12 • , 13 • , 23 ] . This selective degradation of only ErbB1 receptors may explain the more carcinogenic nature of other ErbB family members . For instance , expression of ErbB2 has long been correlated with many carcinomas and poor prognosis [ 24 , 25 ] . One plausible explanation for ErbB2’s carcino - genic effect is its ability to increase the ratio of ErbB1 – ErbB2 heterodimers over ErbB1 homodimers . In doing so , alterations in membrane trafficking would result in enhanced mitogenicity . Signaling from within the endosome The concept that activated receptors interact with down - stream signaling molecules at discrete endocytic locations has been postulated for years [ 26 , 27 ] . Previously , testing this hypothesis was limited by the inability to trap an acti - vated receptor at unique endocytic locales without significantly altering the receptor structure and / or impair - ing signaling pathways . Now , with a clearer understanding of the initial stages of endocytosis and receptor desensiti - zation , less invasive cell biological methods for disrupting endocytosis have been developed . Thus , there has been a plethora of data examining receptor signaling prior to entry into the endocytic pathway . The two most commonly used tools are dominant - negative constructs of the GTPase dynamin and the GPCR - binding protein arrestin . Overexpression of dominant inhibitory forms of dynamin ( those that can not bind or hydrolyze GTP ) blocks clathrin - mediated endocytosis [ 28 ] , causing the retention of many , but not all , receptors at the cell sur - face . Overexpression of dominant - negative forms of arrestin [ 10 , 29 • ] specifically blocks the endocytosis of GPCR . Arrestin binds activated GPCRs after they become phosphorylated on serine residues within their carboxyl ter - mini through a GPCR - kinase - mediated feedback loop . Arrestin binding prevents activated GPCR further interact - ing with heterotrimeric G proteins and transducing signals . In addition , arrestins serve as adapter molecules that target activated GPCR to endocytic coated pits [ 30 ] . Together , these methods have proven effective in a direct comparison of the signaling of receptors retained on the cell surface with that of those allowed to enter the endocytic pathway . Not surprisingly , there are some signaling pathways that are completely unaffected or enhanced by retaining activated receptors at the cell surface . These include the most proximal events in receptor signaling , such as the intramolecular kinase activity of RTKs , activation of heterotrimeric G proteins , 206 Cell regulation Figure 1 Structural and signaling properties of the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family ( see text for details ) .

QXD 02 / 24 / 2000 01 : 54 Page 206 phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate - 1 ( IRS - 1 ) by the insulin receptor , regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity and stimulation of phospholipase C g . Given the plasma membrane location and / or the kinetics of activation of these effectors , it seems unlikely that receptor endocytosis would be a prerequisite for their activity . More intriguing are those events that are attenuated when receptor endocytosis is inhibited — namely the activation of phosphatidyl inositol 3 - kinase ( PI3 - K ) and ERK 1 / 2 [ 31 – 36 ] . In the case of insulin receptor signaling , PI3 - K associates with IRS - 1 in an insulin - dependent manner as a prerequisite for signaling . When insulin receptor endocy - tosis is blocked by dominant - negative dynamin , there is a significant reduction in insulin - dependent PI3 - K activity , despite full tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin recep - tor and IRS - 1 . The change in kinase activity is reflected in a corresponding decrease in the amount of p85 regulatory subunit of PI3 - K associated with IRS - 1 [ 31 ] . Although there are a number of cell surface receptors that require endocytosis for ERK 1 / 2 activation , there are an equal number that do not ( Table 1 ) . One possible explana - tion is that the need for endocytosis is receptor - specific and that the role of endocytosis in ERK 1 / 2 activation may be a mechanism through which signal specificity is con - ferred . These results are reminiscent of the differential effects on ras signaling through MAP kinase observed upon caveolae disruption ( see above ) and suggest that multiple mechanisms exist to spatially regulate the MAP kinase signaling pathway . Interestingly , it has been reported that dominant inhibitory dynamin decreases m opiod receptor mediated activation of ERK 1 / 2 in HEK293 cells independent of an effect on the endocytosis of the µ opiod receptor [ 37 ] . It is possible this is a consequence of dynamin’s role in regulating an inter - mediate signaling protein whose endocytosis is required for ERK 1 / 2 activation . Alternatively , these data may sug - gest a second role for dynamin , in addition to regulating endocytosis . However , expression of dominant - negative dynamin has no effect on ERK 1 / 2 activation by the a 2 adrenergic receptor , which , like the m opiod receptor , cou - ples to G a i / o guanine - nucleotide - binding proteins and is internalized in a dynamin - independent manner [ 38 ] . Taken together , this selective inhibition of signaling path - ways suggests that an activated receptor and requisite Regulation of signal transduction by endocytosis Ceresa and Schmid 207 Figure 2 Endocytosis of signaling receptors .

The coated vesicles form , then shed their clathrin coats and fuse with the mildly acidic early endosome , where the RTKs are sorted for recycling or degradation . Ligands dissociate from ErbB2 - containing dimers , which are then sorted on a monesin - sensitive step to the recycling endosome and returned to the cell surface . ErbB1 dimers retain bound ligand until encountering the lower pH or later endosomal compartments . Within endosomes , ErbB1 dimers associate with c - Cbl , are ubiquitinated and targeted for degradation in the lysosome .

Upon hormone stimulation , the a and bg subunits of the activated heterotrimeric G protein dissociate to cause activation of downstream effectors such as adenylyl cyclase ( AC ) . The bg subunits facilitate the G - protein - coupled receptor kinase ( GRK ) - mediated phosphorylation of ligand - bound b 2 AR . b - Arrestin ( b Arr ) binds both the phosphorylated b 2 AR and c - Src , causing formation of the b 2 AR – b - arrestin – c - Src complex at the plasma membrane .

QXD 02 / 24 / 2000 01 : 54 Page 207 signaling molecules are not sufficient to direct appropriate cellular responses — endocytosis is also an essential component . Signal transduction can regulate endocytosis Although the role of the endocytic pathway in receptor sig - nal transduction has only recently been appreciated , it has been known for some time that signaling receptors must be active for their endocytosis [ 39 ] . Our understanding of the role of receptor signaling in endocytosis has been lim - ited to mutagenesis studies defining the receptor domains that are involved in recruitment to clathrin - coated pits and endocytosis . New studies using endocytosis - deficient cell lines have readdressed this mechanism and the nonrecep - tor tyrosine kinase c - Src has emerged as an important regulator of endocytosis . The effect of the endocytic pathway on signaling and vice versa has been best characterized using b 2 AR as a model . With the first observation of b 2 AR internalization upon agonist stimulation came the hypothesis that this was strictly a mechanism by which activated receptors were removed from the cell surface and sequestered within the cell to prevent further activation of a downstream effector , namely adenylyl cyclase . This hypothesis continued to garner momentum with the observation of ligand - depen - dent phosphorylation and the subsequent association of b - arrestin to prevent further signaling to heterotrimeric G proteins . More recent results have suggested an additional role for b - arrestin binding . In this work , Luttrell et al . [ 40 •• ] demon - strate that agonist activation of b 2 AR results in the formation of a b 2 AR – b - arrestin – c - Src complex . This protein complex targets the receptor to a clathrin - coated pit ( Figure 2b ) . It has been shown that kinase - inactive forms of c - Src can inhibit , and constitutively active forms of c - Src can enhance , b 2 AR endocytosis [ 41 ] . Activation of both b 2 AR and the LPA ( lysophosphatidic acid ) receptor leads to phosphorylation of dynamin , in the former case , through a c - Src - dependent process [ 41 , 42 ] . These data suggest that c - Src is an upstream regulator of dynamin function in b 2 AR endocytosis . It has been shown that EGF - stimulated acti - vation of c - Src leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of clathrin and that phosphorylation is required for the recruitment of clathrin to the membrane [ 43 ] . Taken together , these data strongly suggest a role for c - Src in receptor endocytosis — the question remains whether c - Src is a regulator of dynamin function or a recruiter of clathrin or both . Another candidate protein for regulating b 2 AR signaling is the ezrin – radixin – moesin ( ERM ) - binding phosphopro - tein - 50 ( EBP50 ) . EBP50 binds to the G - protein - regulated kinase 5 ( GRK5 ) - phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail of b 2 AR via a PDZ domain and to the cortical cytoskeleton through an ERM - binding domain . In HEK293 cells , the disruption of the b 2 AR – EBP50 – actin interaction results in dimin - ished b 2 AR recycling [ 44 • ] . Although EBP50 has not been shown to have a direct role in b 2 AR signaling , its effects on b 2 AR endocytic trafficking are likely to have important implications in signaling [ 44 • ] , similar to those described above for ErbB family members . Conclusions The key to fully understanding the cell physiology mediat - ed by cell surface receptors lies not only in the identification of downstream effectors but also in the exquisite spatial and temporal regulation of the interactions 208 Cell regulation Table 1 Consequences of inhibited endocytosis on ERK activity .

Clearly , membrane trafficking plays an important role both in controlling the location of signaling interactions and in regulating the cellular degradation and recycling of the activated receptor .
