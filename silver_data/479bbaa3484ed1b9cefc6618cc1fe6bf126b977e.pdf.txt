Purpose . Growing evidence suggests diﬀerent systemic exposure of anti - vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti - VEGF ) agents with repeated intravitreal application . Since the penetration of anti - VEGF agents through vascular barrier was reported , the interaction of anti - VEGF with nonresident platelets has become a topic of interest . The purpose of this study was to evaluate , with the help of visualization techniques , whether platelets take up the anti - VEGF agents ranibizumab , aﬂibercept , and bevacizumab . Methods . The uptake of anti - VEGF agents with or without VEGF treatment was investigated using immunoﬂuorescence and immunogold staining in human platelets . The role of actin ﬁlaments and clathrin - coated vesicles in the transport of ranibizumab , aﬂibercept , and bevacizumab was evaluated by two pharmacologic inhibitors : staurosporine ( protein kinase C inhibitor ) and cytochalasin D . Results . All three anti - VEGF agents were taken up by platelets and colocalized with VEGF . Ranibizumab and aﬂibercept were mainly detected in alpha - granules ; however , bevacizumab was equally localized in alpha - granules and in platelet vesicles . Both staurosporine and cytochalasin D completely inhibited the uptake of aﬂibercept into platelets . Both pharmacological inhibitors also decreased the transport of ranibizumab and bevacizumab into platelets . Bevacizumab was signiﬁcantly more frequently colocalized within clathrin - coated vesicles than ranibizumab and aﬂibercept . Conclusion . All three anti - VEGF agents are taken up by platelets and internalized in alpha - granules , which may result in a higher local exposure of anti - VEGF after the activation of platelets , potentially contributing to arterial thromboembolic events . Clathrin - coated vesicles seem to be more prominent in the transport of bevacizumab than ranibizumab and aﬂibercept . Nevertheless , whether the diﬀerent localization and transport of bevacizumab are truly related to speciﬁc diﬀerences of receptor - mediated endocytosis has to be revealed by further research . 1 . Introduction Anti - vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti - VEGF ) agents have a broad ﬁeld of application due to their impact on tumor growth and metastasis in oncology or in sealing , and antiangiogenic eﬀect in the treatment of neovascular age - related macular degeneration ( nAMD ) or other retinal diseases . The inhibitors have a certain range of molecular properties : Ranibizumab is a recombinant humanized 48 kDa antibody fragment ( F ab ) , designed to easily penetrate the retina with low serum concentrations [ 1 – 3 ] . In contrast , aﬂibercept is a 115 kDa VEGF receptor fusion protein , which also contains an Fc portion [ 1 , 4 ] . Similarly , bevacizumab is a full - length recombinant humanized IgG1 antibody and was primarily developed for the intravenous treatment of met - astatic cancer [ 5 ] . It has been reported several times that monoclonal antibodies are sequestered in platelets , similar to most other serum proteins and growth factors such as platelet - derived growth factors ( PDGFs ) , transforming growth factors HindawiJournal of Ophthalmology Volume 2021 , Article ID 8811672 , 12 pages https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1155 / 2021 / 8811672 ( TGFs ) , vascular endothelial growth factors ( VEGFs ) , and epithelial growth factors ( EGFs ) [ 6 – 8 ] . Under physiological conditions , platelets circulate in the blood in a resting state and are crucial in detecting vascular injuries to provide he - mostasis . Due to contact of platelets with microlesions , platelets adhere to and spread on the thrombogenic matrix forming an activated platelet layer with the subsequent release of proteins from storage granules [ 9 ] . Platelet activating factors contribute to the further recruitment and aggregation of platelets , as well as other cells including monocytes and ﬁbroblasts , leading to stabilization of the hemostatic plug [ 10 ] . These platelet features have been studied and applied as an autologous platelet concentrate in reconstructive and re - generative medicine ( wound healing , maxillofacial bone de - fect , musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries ) , as well as in ophthalmology to treat refractive corneal ulcers [ 10 – 16 ] and to increase the closure rate of idiopathic full - thickness macular holes or optic pits after vitrectomy [ 17 ] . Activated platelets can also form pathogenic thrombi in patients with atherothrombotic disease [ 18 ] . Until now , the uptake and intracellular transport of anti - VEGF agents have been investigated in retinal endothelium and retinal pigment epithelium ; however , little is known about these mechanisms in platelets [ 6 , 19 – 21 ] . We have previously shown that increased levels of FITC - labeled ranibizumab , aﬂibercept , and bevacizumab were found using ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) analysis after the activation of platelets with either thrombin receptor - activating peptide - 6 ( TRAP ) , proteinase - activated receptor 4 - activating peptide ( PAR - 4 - AP ) , or thrombin [ 21 , 22 ] . Therefore , the question arises as to whether all anti - VEGF agents are taken up by platelets and which mechanisms are involved in their endo - cytosis by platelets ( Figure 1 ) . If platelets act as a “drug vehicle” , anti - VEGF agents may not only target tumor cells , but also contribute to vascular homeostasis and repair after vascular injury [ 23 ] . Adverse vascular events such as arterial thromboembolic events ( ATEs ) have been reported in cancer patients treated with systemic chemotherapy ( aﬂibercept [ 24 ] , bevacizumab [ 5 , 25 , 26 ] ) in comparison to placebo . Moreover , the intravitreal application of anti - VEGF agents , especially aﬂibercept and bevacizumab , leads to their accumulation in the blood after repeated in - jections [ 2 ] . Therefore , anti - VEGF associated systemic side eﬀects due to increased local concentrations of anti - VEGF agents after platelet activation are of interest , not only in oncology , but also in ophthalmology [ 11 , 27 – 31 ] . Considering the fact that platelets play an important role in both vascular homeostasis [ 32 – 35 ] and vascular disease , including atherothrombosis and ATEs [ 11 , 36 – 39 ] , the purpose of this study was to investigate whether and how platelets take up ranibizumab , aﬂibercept , and bevacizumab . Furthermore , we investigated whether the cellular uptake diﬀers for the most widely used drugs by characterizing the intracellular traﬃcking mechanisms . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . IsolationofPlatelets . Venous blood was drawn into acid - citrate - dextrose ( ACD ) anticoagulant from healthy Caucasian volunteers , who had not taken any drugs during the previous 10 days . The blood was centrifuged at 200 g for 20 min at room temperature . Platelets were obtained by centrifuging platelet - rich plasma ( PRP ) at 900 g for 10 min at room temperature and resuspended in Tyrode’s buﬀer ( pH 7 . 4 ) and 4 % formaldehyde , after which 3 % paraformalde - hyde was added for platelet ﬁxation . This work adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki , and the Institu - tional Ethics Committee of the University of T¨ubingen granted approval with a waiver of informed consent for this retrospective study using platelet donation of healthy volunteers . 2 . 2 . Primary Antibodies . The following primary antibodies were used : FITC - labeled ranibizumab ( Lucentis ; Novartis Pharma GmbH , Germany ) , aﬂibercept ( Eylea , Bayer Pharma , Berlin , Germany ) , and bevacizumab ( Avastin ; Roche Pharma , Grenzach - Wyhlen , Germany ) . FITC label - ing was performed according to the standard procedures provided by the manufacturer ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . The dilution of anti - VEGF agents was 1 : 100 ( 10 μ g / mL ) , and rabbit anti - VEGF ( Abcam ) was 1 : 100 . 2 . 3 . Confocal Immunoﬂuorescence Microscopy . Platelets were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 3 hours at room temperature and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton - 100 . After blocking in donkey serum ( Sigma ) , platelets were incubated for one hour with primary and secondary antibodies , re - spectively ( mouse anti - FITC antibody , 1 : 200 , Abcam , ab10257 ; donkey anti - rabbit - DyLight 649 , 1 : 800 , Dianova , 711 - 496 - 152 ) . Finally , platelets were counterstained with phalloidin - Alexa 549 ( 1 : 100 , Molecular Probes , A22283 ) . Moreover , 1 % BSA ( bovine serum albumin ) in PBS ( phosphate buﬀered saline ) was used as a control . Immu - noﬂuorescence images were examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope ( Leica TCS - SP / Leica DM RB confocal laser scanning microscope ) and processed with the Leica Confocal Software ( LCS ) ( version 2 . 61 ) . 2 . 4 . Electron Microscopy of Anti - VEGF Agents , VEGF , and Clathrin . Platelets were ﬁxed in 3 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 01 % glutaraldehyde for 3 hours at 4 ° C and then centri - fuged . The pellet was embedded in 3 . 5 % agarose at 37 ° C and cooled on ice . Small parts of agarose blocks were dehydrated in graded ethanol by gradually lowering the temperature to − 35 ° C and embedded in Lowicryl K4M ( Polysciences , Germany ) at − 35 ° C . The blocks were cut with an ultrami - crotome ( Ultracut ; Reichert , Vienna , Austria ) , and ultrathin sections ( 30 nm ) were mounted on formvar - coated nickel grids . After the addition of blocking solution ( PBS with 10 % goat ( Dako ) ) , the ultrathin sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight and secondary antibody for 1 hour ( mouse anti - FITC antibody , 1 : 100 , Abcam , ab10257 ) . Washing was done with both 1 % BSA in PBS and 0 . 5 % skimmed milk powder diluted in 1 % BSA in PBS . Subse - quently , the sections were incubated with gold - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( gold particle diameter : 6 nm ; Jackson ) 2 Journal of Ophthalmology and 12nm gold - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG for 1 hour ( gold particle diameter : 12nm ; Jackson ) ( antibodies were di - luted at a ratio of 1 : 20 in PBS / BSA / 0 . 5 % skimmed milk powder ) . Finally , the sections were stained with 1 % uranyl acetate for 2 minutes . Samples were examined using a Libra 120 electron microscope ( Zeiss Oberkochen ) operating at 120k . 2 . 5 . Staurosporine and Cytochalasin D . Staurosporine ( protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibitor , 10 nM , Sigma - Aldrich , Germany ) and cytochalasin D ( 0 . 5 mM , Sigma - Aldrich , Germany ) were used . The immunocytochemical labeling and silver enhancement ( preembedding ) were performed on platelets . Subsequently , embedding was performed in gly - cidyl ether ( Serva , Germany ) . The ultrathin ( 30 nm ) sections were prepared for transmission electron microscopy . 2 . 6 . Statistical Analysis . Data of immunogold labeling re - garding the localization and colocalization of anti - VEGF agents and VEGF or clathrin are presented as a percentage of gold particles of the total number of gold particles or each compartment . Data are presented as the mean ± SEM ( standard error of the mean ) of three diﬀerent experiments . The one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was performed between three groups . Signiﬁcance was considered at P < 0 . 05 . Statistical analyses were performed using com - mercial software ( SPSS version 22 . 0 , SPSS , Inc . ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Intracellular Localization of Anti - VEGF Agents in Platelets . All three anti - VEGF agents were taken up to slightly varying degrees by platelets ( Figure 2 ) . Immunogold microscopy conﬁrmed that anti - VEGF agents were present in resting platelets following a two - hour coincubation . Both ranibizumab and aﬂibercept were present in platelets ( Figure 2 ) and colocalized with VEGF in alpha - granules ( Figure 3 ) . Quantitative analysis of gold staining revealed that 80 . 68 ± 2 . 68 % of ranibizumab and 73 . 95 ± 2 . 33 % of aﬂi - bercept were contained in alpha - granules ( P � 0 . 03 ) . In addition , 51 . 27 ± 3 . 88 % and 44 . 27 ± 3 . 39 % of bevacizumab were contained in vesicles and in alpha - granules ( P � 0 . 0001 between all anti - VEGF agents ) ( Figure 4 ) . All VEGF - inhibitors colocalized with VEGF , with 41 . 34 ± 1 . 76 % and 41 . 15 ± 2 . 53 % of alpha - granules labeled for ranibizumab or aﬂibercept and VEGF , respectively ( P � 0 . 81 ) . Bevacizumab showed colocalization with VEGF to an extent of 70 . 38 ± 2 . 70 % ( P � 0 . 0001 between all anti - VEGF agents ) . 3 . 2 . Eﬀect of Staurosporine and Cytochalasin on Transport of Anti - VEGFAgentsintoPlatelets . The nonselective inhibition of protein kinases , including protein kinase C by staur - osporine or stopping actin polymerization by cytochalasin D , completely inhibited the transport of aﬂibercept into platelets . Both pharmacological inhibitors also decreased the transport of bevacizumab into platelets . Protein kinase C inhibition by staurosporine impaired the transport of bev - acizumab to a lesser extent than ranibizumab . In the platelets exposed to cytochalasin D , the transport of ranibizumab was unchanged in comparison to the control ( Figures 5 and 6 ) . 3 . 3 . Colocalization of Anti - VEGF Agents and Clathrin . Quantitative analysis of gold staining showed that ranibi - zumab , aﬂibercept , and bevacizumab colocalized with Mitochondria Endoplasmatic reticulum Lysosomes Alpha granules Dense granules Open canalicular system Golgi complex Vesicles Figure 1 : Schematic representation of the platelet organelles : Platelets contain three major granule types : alpha - granules ( 50 – 80 per platelet ) , dense granules ( 3 – 6 per platelet ) , and lysosomes ( 1 – 3 per platelet ) .

In particular , at the periphery of vesicles , an intensive accu - mulation of bevacizumab in the vicinity of clathrin signals was observed ( Figure 7 ) . 4 . Discussion Anti - VEGF agents are widely used in treatment of cancer patients and are the ﬁrst - line therapy of neovascular AMD and macular edema secondary to diabetes and retinal vein occlusion . Therefore , the comparison between compounds is warranted , and the safety proﬁle has gained interest since vascular events were observed in a recently approved drug [ 40 , 41 ] . The adverse events are primarily explained by the blocking of VEGF signaling and the diﬀerent suppression of serum proteins by anti - VEGF agents [ 3 , 42 , 43 ] . Meyer et al . showed a possible molecular mechanism of bevacizumab - induced platelet activation by the cross - linking of Fc re - ceptors [ 44 ] , which was conﬁrmed by Nomura et al . [ 45 ] . In the previous experiments , we observed that activation - de - pendent platelet function is more impaired with aﬂibercept and bevacizumab compared to ranibizumab , without any ( d ) ( e ) ( f ) ( g ) ( h ) ( i ) Figure 3 : Colocalization of anti - VEGF agents and VEGF using triple immune ﬂuorescence staining and double immunogold staining in human platelets .

Journal of Ophthalmology 5 impact on platelet aggregation . Moreover , FITC - labeled aﬂibercept and bevacizumab , as well as ranibizumab , were signiﬁcantly upregulated in activated platelets [ 21 , 22 ] . Therefore , the anti - VEGF agents might be transported into platelets and then localized in one of three major granule types : α - granules , dense granules , and lysosomes ; this can be demonstrated by immunoﬂuorescence and electron mi - croscopy [ 46 – 49 ] . In the current study , we were able to conﬁrm and further characterize the uptake of three anti - VEGF agents into platelets . Ranibizumab , aﬂibercept , and bevacizumab were localized in alpha - granules . However , bevacizumab was equally found in both alpha - granules and platelet vesicles . The bevacizumab results are in accordance with the study of Verheul et al . , which showed the colocalization of bev - acizumab with P - selectin and ﬁbronectin to be indicative of alpha - granules [ 6 ] . However , electron microscopy in this study provided further information about potential trans - port processes . Immunogold staining conﬁrmed that bev - acizumab was equally localized both in alpha - granules and ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) ( f ) ( g ) ( h ) ( i ) Figure 5 : Silver enhancement ( preembedding ) using immunoelectron microscopy in human platelets exposed to pharmacologic inhibitors : staurosporine and cytochalasin D .

In addition , bevacizumab was colocalized with VEGF at a signiﬁcantly higher level than ranibizumab and aﬂibercept despite the same concentration of anti - VEGF agents used in our experiment . Systemic exposure to bev - acizumab following intravitreal administration is assumed to be much higher and longer in comparison to the two other anti - VEGF agents [ 3 ] , which could be explained by the release of bevacizumab into platelet extracellular vesicles by activated platelets . As already pointed out by Berezin et al . and Gasecka et al . , platelets are the main source of extracellular vesicles in plasma , which are the cargo for a large number of biological - active molecules including cytokines , chemokines , hor - mones , enzymes , growth factors , and their receptors ( e . g . , VEGF ) , as well as adhesion receptors coordinating cell - to - cell interactions [ 50 , 51 ] . They contribute to numerous bi - ological mechanisms such as microvascular inﬂammation , atherosclerotic plaque shaping and rupture , endothelial dysfunction , angiogenesis , neovascularization , thrombosis , ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) ( f ) ( g ) ( h ) ( i ) Figure 6 : Immunogold staining using immunoelectron microscopy in human platelets exposed to pharmacologic inhibitors : staurosporine and cytochalasin D .

Journal of Ophthalmology 7 cardiac remodeling , and kidney dysfunction [ 52 – 57 ] . In addition , platelet extracellular vesicles seem to be associated with increased blood thrombogenicity and the subsequent risk of atherothrombotic events since they were shown to adhere to the injured endothelium and recruit activated platelets [ 58 – 60 ] . The question of whether platelet extracellular vesicles as a potential marker of “vulnerable blood” might be helpful in identifying patients at risk for adverse events has been raised . However , further research is needed to develop and stan - dardize the current methods for the accurate determination and quantiﬁcation of platelet extracellular vesicles [ 55 , 61 – 63 ] . In other studies on the uptake of anti - VEGF drugs , bevacizumab was mainly found close to or attached to the cytoskeleton , along actin ﬁlaments , but also in early endo - somes in retinal pigment epithelial ( RPE ) cells [ 64 , 65 ] . In contrast , ranibizumab was not observed within the Ranibizumab Vesicles Alpha - granules Aflibercept Bevacizumab ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) ( e ) ( f ) ( g ) ( h ) ( i ) ( j ) ( k ) ( l ) Figure 7 : Colocalization of anti - VEGF agents and clathrin using double immunogold staining in vesicles ( a – c ) and alpha - granules ( d – f ) of human platelets .

Scale bar represents 1 µ m . 8 Journal of Ophthalmology cytoskeletal fraction [ 65 ] . In addition , aﬂibercept uptake into RPE as well as retinal endothelial cells ( iBREC : immortalized bovine retinal endothelial cells ) was reported to lead to localization close to the Golgi apparatus [ 66 – 68 ] . The dif - ferent localization of bevacizumab points strongly to the receptor - mediated endocytosis of bevacizumab . Since bev - acizumab , but not ranibizumab , colocalized with actin ﬁl - aments in RPE cells [ 64 , 65 ] , two pharmacological inhibitors of the endocytic pathway [ 69 ] , cytochalasin D and staur - osporine , were evaluated in this study . Both pharmacologic inhibitors disrupted actin polymerization and totally inhibited the endocytosis of aﬂibercept into platelets . Actin - mediated transport has a greater signiﬁcance for phagocy - tosis / macropinocytosis [ 70 , 71 ] . In platelets pretreated with staurosporine or cytochalasin D , a decrease of intracellular bevacizumab was observed in accordance with the investi - gations of Terasaki et al . [ 68 ] . Although no signiﬁcant in - hibition of bevacizumab uptake was found , receptor - mediated endocytosis cannot be ruled out since actin - dis - rupting agents do not eliminate all actin structures [ 71 ] . Moreover , actin ﬁlaments do not seem to play a main role in receptor - mediated endocytosis [ 71 – 73 ] . Further , staur - osporine inhibited the transport of ranibizumab to a greater extent than bevacizumab in our study , and cytochalasin D did not change its transport into platelets . The discrepancy in eﬀect between these two pharmacological inhibitors of ranibizumab might be related to disrupted cell structure or platelet aggregation . The presence of bevacizumab in platelet vesicles and the reduced uptake of anti - VEGF agents after inhibition with actin - disrupting agents drew our attention to the role of one of the most important receptor - mediated endocytic path - ways , which involves clathrin - coated pits [ 73 ] . Since clathrin is a major component of coated vesicles , electron micros - copy allowed us to visualize the colocalization of anti - VEGF agents and clathrin [ 74 ] , which was signiﬁcantly more frequently observed with bevacizumab than with ranibizu - mab and aﬂibercept . This proved the presence of a clathrin - dependent endocytosis of anti - VEGF agents in platelets . Furthermore , this observation suggests Fc ɣ - receptor - de - pendent endocytosis of bevacizumab [ 75 – 77 ] . Since rani - bizumab is a Fab fragment of monoclonal antibody , clathrin - dependent endocytosis could also be caused by binding to the VEGF receptor [ 78 – 81 ] . Nevertheless , the extent of Fc receptor endocytosis in uptake and traﬃcking of bev - acizumab or aﬂibercept is still unclear and has to be elu - cidated in future studies . In conclusion , all three anti - VEGF agents were taken up by platelets , mainly via clathrin - dependent endocytosis . Ranibizumab , aﬂibercept , and bevacizumab were localized in alpha - granules . Therefore , they are transported in platelets and may be released with pro - or antiangiogenic proteins from platelets at diﬀerent platelet activation sites . In contrast to ranibizumab and aﬂibercept , bevacizumab was equally found in alpha - granules and in platelet vesicles resembling endosomes , which is consistent with its more frequent colocalization with clathrin ; therefore , it is evidence for receptor - mediated endocytosis . The binding of intra - venously administered bevacizumab to the Fc receptor could lead to an increased risk of ATEs due to its accumulation in platelets through sorting away from the degradation path - way [ 2 , 82 ] . Therefore , deviating endocytosis pathways and localization in the cells may be manifested in diﬀerent pharmacological activities and the safety proﬁle of anti - VEGF agents . Further research is needed to show the rel - evance of platelet - loaded anti - VEGF agents in vascular healing after injury and thromboembolic events .
