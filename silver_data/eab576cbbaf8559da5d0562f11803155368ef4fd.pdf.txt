The number of manuscripts from China is increasing rapidly . Many studies have been carried out to research how to improve the efficacy of peer review . The Principle of Universality ( freedom and responsibility ) of Science in Statute 5 of the International Council for Science ( ICSU ) states that the free and responsible practice of science is fundamen - tal to scientific advancement and human and environmental well - being . 1 Ideally , peer review should abide by this principle , and oppose ‘discrimination based on such factors as ethnic origin , religion , citizenship , lan - guage , political or other opinion , sex , gender identity , sexual orientation , disability , or age’ . 1 , 2 However , peer review is a human activity and departures from this ideal can occur . . For example , in previous studies , Gilbert et al . 3 assessed whether manuscripts possessed differing peer - review and manu - script - processing characteristics , or had a variable chance of acceptance , associated with the gender of the participants ; other researchers studied the relation between the geographical region of origin of manuscripts and peer review ; 4 – 9 Adler and Liyanarachchi investigated the effect of location of editor - ial review offices on peer review ; 10 some researchers studied the differences between blinded and unblinded peer review ; 7 , 11 – 15 there have also been some studies carried out to research whether the peer review was affected when reviewers knew that their identities would be disclosed . 11 , 16 However , except for Link’s article , 9 there are almost no published works about the effect of review - ers’ geographical origin on the peer review of papers from different geographical regions of origin – Link concluded that reviewers from the USA and outside the USA evaluated non - USA papers similarly and evaluated Effect of reviewer’s origin on peer review : China vs . non - China 265 L E A R N E D P U B L I S H I N G VO L . 2 5 N O . 4 O C T O B E R 2 0 1 2 Effect of reviewer’s origin on peer review : China vs . non - China Xiangyi ZHANG Tsinghua University , China ABSTRACT . Peer review is important in ensuring quality . As science and technology develops in China , the number of scientific papers is increasing , and it is interesting to discover whether there are differences between reviewers from China and those from other countries when they review manuscripts submitted by Chinese authors . This study was based on an environmental academic Chinese ( English language ) journal . The peer review of 157 manuscripts from Chinese authors was analyzed . There are significant differences in whether a potential reviewer accepts an invitation to review ; however , the outcome of peer review is almost unaffected by the reviewer’s geographical origin . © Xiangyi Zhang 2012 papers submitted by USA authors more favorably , with USA reviewers having a sig - nificant preference for USA papers . Link suggested that reviewers may evaluate papers submitted by authors coming from their own country more favourably . Funding of science and technology in China is increasing , and as a result so is the number of scientific manuscripts . The report by Thomson Reuters ( Global Research Report China : Research and Collaboration in the New Geography of Science ) 17 and the report by the Institute of Scientific and Technical Infor - mation of China ( ISTIC ) ( Statistical Data of Chinese S & T Papers 2011 ) 18 both showed that the number of scientific manuscripts from Chinese authors stands second only to the USA . Thus it is instructive to research whether there are differences between reviewers from China and reviewers from other countries when they review the manu - scripts from Chinese authors . This study was based on an environmental academic English - language journal based in China . The peer review of submissions from Chinese authors was analyzed . The study investigated what happened both in inviting potential reviewers , and what happened in the evaluation . The aim was to provide a useful reference point to aid practise and for further research . About the journal The journal was created in 2007 and has been indexed in the SCI database since 2009 . Each manuscript received is sent to external reviewers . In 2008 , the journal began to invite potential reviewers from non - China countries for each manuscript . Single - blind peer review is adopted , such that the reviewers know who the authors are . 157 manuscripts submitted to the journal during 2009 and 2010 were studied , includ - ing 140 manuscripts with all Chinese authors and 17 manuscripts with at least one Chinese corresponding author or Chinese first author . All manuscripts were original submissions ( revised manuscripts were excluded ) . These manuscripts had been sent to the potential reviewers without first ask - ing them if they would be willing to review . The authors could suggest potential re - viewers , but the journal did not send the manuscript to them . Peer reviewers were chosen for their knowledge and expertise with regard to the subject of the manuscript . There are six possible recommendations on the review form , i . e . accept , minor revi - sion ( language and technical ) , major revision ( language and technical ) , resubmit , reject , and ‘could be resubmitted as a short communication’ . In this study , the possible recommendations were divided into two cat - egories : a positive recommendation which included accept , minor revision ( language and technical ) and major revision ( language and technical ) , and a negative recommenda - tion which included the other three possible recommendations . Results Table 1 shows the basic information on invit - ing reviewers . Reviewers from China and reviewers from other countries are separately listed . 459 reviewers from China and 980 reviewers from other countries were invited . Some returned reviews , some did not respond to the invitation , some declined the invitation , and the others could not be contacted due to an invalid email addresses . Table 2 shows detailed information on reviews received . Reviews from China and from non - China are separated .

The authors are , of course , not native English speakers , so reviewers might point out language problems . Sometimes , helpful reviewers annotated the original submission as well as providing comments in the reports . These cases are listed in Table 2 . In addition , the mean time of peer review and the mean number of reviews received for the manu - scripts are also shown . Among the 157 manuscripts studied , there are 31 manuscripts which received reviews only from reviewers from China and 14 manuscripts which received reviews only from reviewers of other countries . The pro - portions are 19 . 7 % and 8 . 9 % , respectively . Some special cases occurred during the peer review , which are shown in Table 3 . Reviewers from countries outside China were mainly in Europe , Asia , and North America . Reviewers were invited from 57 countries in total , as shown in Table 4 . Reviews were received from 35 countries as shown in Table 5 . Among the 980 reviewers invited from outside China , there were 49 Chinese ( 5 . 0 % ) . Among the 183 reviews received from the total , there were 17 reviews fur - nished by Chinese reviewers ( 9 . 3 % ) , as shown in Tables 6 and 7 . 34 . 7 % of Chinese invited from outside China sent in reviews .

Analysis and discussion Conclusions on differences between review - ers from China and from outside China are clear . 1 . Reviewers in China were more willing to accept the invitation to review the manu - scripts . As shown in Table 1 , 459 reviewers from China and 980 reviewers from other countries were invited , but the absolute number of reviews from reviewers from China ( 249 , 54 . 2 % ) was more than that of non - China countries ( 183 , 18 . 7 % ) . Among reviewers from outside China , the propor - tion of ‘no response’ was the highest ( 44 . 8 % ) , the proportion of ‘declined’ was 25 . 2 % , and the proportion of ‘invalid email’ was 11 . 3 % . The corresponding proportions of reviewers from China were 23 . 7 % , 19 . 4 % , and 3 . 6 % , respectively . For a single manuscript , the maximum number of potential reviewers invited from China was 9 , and 4 among them returned the reviews . The maximum number of potential reviewers invited from outside China was 26 , but only 2 reviews were received . There was a case where 15 non - China reviewers were invited but no reviews were received . However , in the par - allel case that no reviews from reviewers of China were received , the maximum number of reviewers invited was 5 . 2 . The reviewers from China were more will - ing to annotate the original submissions for 268 Xiangyi Zhang L E A R N E D P U B L I S H I N G VO L . 2 5 N O . 4 O C T O B E R 2 0 1 2 Table 4 .

As shown in Table 2 , 72 . 3 % of China reviewers and 74 . 3 % of non - China reviewers felt that there were language problems . However , the proportion of China reviewers who annotated the manuscripts was significantly higher than the proportion of non - China reviewers . 3 . The proportion of ‘adopted’ reviews from reviewers from outside China was higher than that from reviewers from China , but the two proportions were similar , at 75 . 4 % and 70 . 7 % respectively ( Table 2 ) . 4 . The proportion of ‘positive recommenda - tions’ from China reviewers was lower than that of non - China reviewers , at 71 . 9 % and 78 . 7 % , respectively . Thus , China reviewers had no preference for manuscripts submitted by Chinese authors . 5 . The review turn - around time of China reviewers was shorter than that of non - China reviewers . The mean turnaround time of all reviewers was 24 . 2 days . For a single manuscript , the longest mean turn - around time of non - China reviewers taken ( 88 days ) was also longer than that of China reviewers taken ( 85 days ) . As mentioned before , the manuscripts were sent to the potential reviewers without first asking them if they would be willing to review , but the identities of authors were disclosed to the reviewers . Therefore , each potential reviewer was aware of the authors’ identities when they received the peer - review invitation . In the studies comparing the blinded and unblinded peer review , some investigations suggested that blinding during peer review did not appear to affect the quality of peer review ; 7 , 11 – 15 however , some studies suggested that unblinded reviewers might be affected to various degrees by various types of bias more . 14 , 15 In this study , the differences were significant during inviting the potential reviewers , but the proportions of adopted reviews were approximately equal . This does not accord with Link’s study . 9 Chinese reviewers are more familiar with the research of Chinese authors , so perhaps more China reviewers are willing to accept the peer - review invitation . However , review - ers from China are also aware of the reputations of the authors and the institu - tions , and more conflicts of interest may exist , so we can speculate that this might be one reason that the proportion of ‘posi - tive recommendations’ and adopted reviews of China reviewers was lower than those of non - China reviewers . The difference between the proportions of adopted reviews of China reviewers and non - China reviewers is very slight , so the outcomes of peer review are almost unaffected by the disclosure of the authors’ identities . Conclusions In general , China reviewers are more willing to accept the peer - review invitation and review the manuscripts more rapidly . The proportion of ‘positive recommendations’ is lower . If this were due to conflicts of interest , when asking China reviewers to review Chinese manuscripts , it might be good prac - tice to ask the reviewers to disclose the potential conflicts of interest at the same time – more research is required . Non - China reviewers give a higher proportion of ‘positive recommendations’ . Non - China reviewers pay more attention to the language . However , a much lower pro - portion of non - China reviewers accept the peer - review invitation , and hence more attention should be paid to searching out the suitable non - China reviewers . Overall , the key finding is that the out - come of peer review is almost unaffected by the reviewer’s geographical origin . References 1 . International Council for Science ( ICSU ) . Statute 5 .
