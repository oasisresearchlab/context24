Both the soluble extracellular ligand , EGF , and mechanical inputs like matrix stiffness , cell adhesion , or stretch activate EGFR - ERK signaling . However , the molecules transducing mechanical forces into EGFR signaling remain unidentified . We previously found that stretch promotes mitosis by mechanically activating the ion channel Piezo1 to trigger ERK signaling . Here , we show that Piezo1 provides the missing link to mechanical EGFR - ERK activation . Both EGF ligand and mechanical or agonist activation of Piezo1 trigger clathrin - mediated endocytosis of EGFR and ERK activation , established markers of EGFR signaling . However , while EGF stimulation requires canonical EGFR tyrosine autophosphorylation , EGFR activation by Piezo1 instead requires Src - p38 kinase - dependent serine EGFR phosphorylation . Additionally , in contrast to the homeostatic signaling downstream EGF activation , direct agonist stimulation of Piezo1 promoted cell cycle re - entry and proliferation in mouse airway epithelia ex vivo via long - term nuclear accumulation of ERK , AP - 1 ( FOS and JUN ) , and YAP , typical of regenerative and malignant signaling . Our results suggest two modes of EGFR signaling : basal EGF - dependent signaling via tyrosine autophosphorylation and mechanically activated Piezo1 - dependent signaling via serine phosphorylation , resulting in sustained proliferation , critical to repair , regeneration , and cancer growth . Given the limited success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer , this new axis may provide a more relevant target for cancer treatment . 3 Introduction Mechanical regulation of cell proliferation , differentiation , and migration was originally described decades ago ( 1 – 3 ) , but only recently have molecules that integrate mechanics and signaling come to light . The mechanosensitive Piezo ion channels and YAP / TAZ transcriptional regulators are the most noteworthy in this integration ( 4 – 7 ) . Human Piezo1 and 2 are mechanically activated cation channels , abundant in a wide variety of tissues and cell types ( 4 ) , that mediate extracellular calcium influx in response to cell confinement ( 8 ) , stretch ( 9 ) , shear stress ( 10 – 12 ) , or matrix stiffness ( 13 , 14 ) . Piezo - dependent calcium entry is critical for development , regeneration , and cancer through its roles in cell migration ( 8 , 13 , 15 ) , matrix remodeling ( 13 , 16 ) , cytokinesis ( 9 ) , or stiffness - dependent nuclear translocation of YAP ( 13 , 14 ) . We found that Piezo1 promotes epithelial cell extrusion in response to crowding ( 17 ) and rapid cell division ( G 2 / M transition ) in response to stretch ( 18 ) . Moreover , stretch also promotes cell exit from quiescence ( G 0 / G 1 transition ) and DNA synthesis ( G 1 / S transition ) ( 19 ) , both requiring Piezo1 ( 20 ) . These studies strengthen the role of mechanical forces and Piezo1 as master regulators of the cell cycle . Soluble growth factors regulate cell function through membrane receptors , too . Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) is a widely expressed Receptor Tyrosine Kinase that autophosphorylates its C - terminal cytoplasmic tyrosine residues after binding extracellular soluble ligands ( 21 – 26 ) . These modified residues act as docking sites for adaptor proteins containing phosphotyrosine ( pY ) - binding SH2 domains , such as SHC and GRB2 . Both endocytic ( AP2 , Clathrin ) and effector proteins ( GEFs - Ras - MAPK , PKB / AKT , PLC , PI3K ) bind pY - bound adaptors , and their specific combination and phosphorylation by EGFR triggers receptor endocytosis and downstream signaling pathways , such as RAS - MAPK , that impact cell migration , cycling ( cell division , quiescence and DNA synthesis ) , and malignancy ( 21 – 23 , 25 , 27 – 35 ) . In response to high ligand doses , EGFR becomes downregulated by a ubiquitin - dependent , non - clathrin endocytic mechanism that targets the receptor for destruction ( 26 , 36 – 38 ) . Importantly , mechanical signals such as cell stretch ( 28 , 29 ) , apicobasal compression ( 39 ) , matrix - cell adhesion and cell spreading ( 31 , 32 , 40 , 41 ) , or substrate stiffness ( 22 , 30 , 34 ) can also activate EGFR endocytosis and signaling . However , little is known about molecules that transduce mechanical forces into EGFR signaling and which EGFR pathways mechanical activation induces . As we previously found that Piezo1 controls stretch - activation of the MAPK ERK ( 18 ) , a target of EGFR , here , we investigate if Piezo1 provides a molecular link between mechanical and EGFR signaling . 4 Results Piezo1 triggers clathrin mediated endocytosis of EGFR To investigate the role of Piezo1 in mechanical activation of EGFR signaling , we exposed cells to shear stress , a previously identified Piezo1 - activating mechanical stimulus ( 10 – 12 ) , and monitored internalization of EGFR phosphorylated on tyrosine 1173 ( pY1173 - EGFR ) , an indicator of active EGFR signaling ( 22 , 40 , 42 , 43 ) . We chose HeLa cells because they endogenously express Piezo1 and are widely used for studying EGFR ( 26 , 38 , 43 – 45 ) . Serum - starved HeLa cells exposed to shear stress for 15 minutes redistributed pY1173 - EGFR from the cell periphery to intracellular puncta that colocalize with the early endosome marker EEA1 ( Fig . 1A - C , F ) . To test if shear stress - dependent EGFR signaling requires Piezo1 , we knocked down Piezo1 with siRNA , confirming its loss by the suppression of calcium transients in response to the synthetic Piezo1 agonist , Yoda1 ( Fig . S1A - C ) . Importantly , siRNA - mediated knockdown of Piezo1 ( siPiezo1 ) or Clathrin Heavy Chain ( siCHC , key endocytic protein ( 26 , 38 ) ) , impaired pY1173 - EGFR internalization by shear stress , resembling unstimulated siControl cells ( Fig . 1B , C , F ) , showing that mechanical activation of EGFR endocytosis requires Piezo1 and clathrin .

Error bars = median ± interquartile range . * * * * p < 0 . 0001 in one - way ANOVA followed by Kruskal - Wallis post - hoc test with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons . 5 To directly activate Piezo1 without triggering other mechanosensitive pathways , we treated serum - starved HeLa cells with the Piezo1 agonist Yoda1 ( 46 ) . 15 - minute incubations with 10 µM Yoda1 or 10 ng / mL EGF ( as positive control ) redistributed pY1173 - EGFR from the cell periphery to intracellular EEA1 + puncta ( Fig . 1D - F ) . In addition , siPiezo1 suppressed responses to Yoda1 , but not to EGF . Knockdown of Clathrin Light Chain suppressed pY1173 - EGFR internalization in all scenarios ( Fig . S1D , E ) . Moreover , Yoda1 - induced EGFR internalization was conserved in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 and canine kidney MDCK cells ( Fig . S1F ) , widely used in EGFR studies ( 47 – 50 ) , suggesting a conserved mechanism . A phosphorylation - independent EGFR antibody further confirmed EGFR internalization in response to Piezo1 activation ( Fig . S1G ) . Together , these results both demonstrate that mechanical stimuli and Yoda1 trigger Piezo1 - dependent EGFR internalization into early endosomes via Clathrin Mediated Endocytosis ( CME ) , a pathway shared with canonical EGFR signaling in response to low EGF doses ( 26 ) . EGFR kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation are dispensable for Piezo1 - triggered EGFR endocytosis . Both canonical ligand - dependent EGFR phosphorylation and internalization or its transactivation by other transmembrane proteins , calcium signaling , or mechanical forces relies on ligand - receptor interaction and EGFR tyrosine autophosphorylation ( 24 , 25 , 28 , 39 , 51 ) . Given that Piezo1 is a transmembrane protein that mediates calcium influx in response to mechanical forces ( 4 ) , we tested if Piezo1 - dependent EGFR signaling requires receptor autophosphorylation . While the EGFR kinase inhibitor PD153035 prevented EGFR internalization in response to EGF , as expected ( 28 , 48 ) , it did not impact EGFR internalization in response to Yoda1 ( Fig . 2 A - C ) . In addition , Yoda1 treatment did not increase pY1068 - or pY1173 - EGFR , two major autophosphorylation sites ( 22 , 40 , 42 , 43 , 48 ) ( Fig . 2D , E ) . Thus , we conclude that Piezo1 - initiated EGFR endocytosis does not require canonical tyrosine autophosphorylation . Figure 2 .

HeLa cell pre - treatment with the SFK inhibitor PP2 suppressed Yoda1 - induced pY1173 - EGFR internalization but did not affect responses to EGF ( Fig . 3A - C ) . This shows that EGFR endocytosis in response to Yoda1 requires SFK activity , unlike EGF - mediated signaling . Although adhesion - dependent EGFR signaling requires SFK - dependent phosphorylation of EGFR on Y1068 ( 41 ) , we find that Yoda1 does not alter pY1068 - EGFR levels ( Fig . 2E ) . Therefore , we investigated other non - canonical mechanisms that might control EGFR endocytosis by Piezo1 . Figure 3 .

AP2 , clathrin ) to internalize EGFR ( 44 , 47 , 48 , 53 – 56 ) . We find that inhibiting p38 with SB202190 suppresses EGFR endocytosis in response to Yoda1 , but not to EGF ( Fig . 3D - F ) . Additionally , immunoblots indicate that Yoda1 but not EGF increases pS1046 / 1047 - EGFR in an SFK - dependent fashion ( Fig . 3G ) . Accordingly , Yoda1 but not EGF also increased the number of pS1046 / 1047 - EGFR + endosomes ( Fig . 3H ) . Thus , Piezo1 activation leads to SFK - and p38 - dependent EGFR serine phosphorylation to drive receptor endocytosis , a pathway shared with cell stress ( 44 , 47 , 48 , 53 – 55 ) . Functional EGFR internalization in response to Piezo1 activation leads to different nuclear signals . ERK1 / 2 MAPK activation is a hallmark of EGFR signaling , with amplitude , duration , and location determining pERK1 / 2 signaling outcomes ( 33 , 57 ) . To investigate how Piezo1 activation of EGFR signaling affects ERK1 / 2 signaling , we next followed total ERK1 / 2 activation and localization . Immunoblots indicate that both Yoda1 and EGF activation of EGFR promote similar levels of ( active ) phosphorylated ERK1 / 2 ( pERK1 / 2 ) ( Fig . 4A , left lanes ) . While the EGFR kinase inhibitor PD153035 suppressed EGF - dependent pERK1 / 2 , it only partially inhibited phosphorylation by Yoda1 ( Fig . 4A , center lanes ) . However , the SFK inhibitor PP2 dampened both Yoda1 - and EGF - induced pERK1 / 2 ( Fig . 4A , right lanes ) . Interestingly , pERK1 / 2 accumulates within nuclei in response to Yoda1 but not EGF treatment ( Fig . 4B , C ) . As in previous experiments , siPiezo1 cells did not respond to Yoda1 ( Fig . S2A , B ) , confirming that Yoda1 relies on Piezo1 . Therefore , despite triggering similar pERK1 / 2 levels , Piezo1 - and EGF - dependent EGFR internalization lead to different signaling outcomes . Spatiotemporal dysregulation underlies many steps of tumorigenesis ( 21 , 33 ) . The duration and strength of nuclear pERK1 / 2 signaling regulates downstream expression dynamics of the transcription factor FOS , which ultimately drives cell proliferation , differentiation , and transformation ( 21 , 33 , 58 ) . We found that Yoda1 - activation of Piezo1 leads to nuclear accumulation of FOS and phosphorylated JUN ( pJUN ) within 2h , whereas EGF does not ( Fig . 4 D , E ) . Loss of Piezo1 inhibits Yoda1 - dependent nuclear translocation of FOS and pJUN ( Fig . S2 C & D ) . FOS and JUN form the dimeric transcription factor AP - 1 , a key driver of oncogenic growth , migration , and distant organ colonization . In turn , AP - 1 cooperates with YAP , which transcriptionally activates dedifferentiation , regeneration , and malignancy , in response to mechanical signals ( 5 , 7 , 59 – 61 ) and Piezo channel activation ( 13 , 14 ) . Importantly , Yoda1 , but not EGF treatment ( Fig . 4 F & G ) , causes nuclear YAP accumulation in a Piezo1 - dependent way ( Fig . S2 E & F ) . These results show that Piezo1 activation triggers sustained nuclear accumulation of AP - 1 ( JUN and FOS ) and their mechanosensitive co - activator YAP .

During steady state cell turnover , EGF activates EGFR signaling via tyrosine autophosphorylation , receptor internalization , and cytoplasmic ERK activation . Here , we find that acute Piezo1 - dependent EGFR activation signals SFK / p38 / nuclear ERK to transcribe early intermediate genes ( FOS , JUN ) and YAP that promote cell cycle entry . In this way , the same receptor can interpret different inputs to relay separate outcomes , depending on the function of its tyrosine kinase domain . Importantly , we confirmed these findings in and ex vivo mouse lung slice model . The regulation we found describes a mechanism for one type of paradoxical signaling , where a given signal can trigger opposing outcomes ( 62 ) . Here , EGF ligand binding its receptor contributes to homeostatic cell turnover in epithelia whereas activating the same receptor with stretch drives a proliferative , regenerative outcome , also associated with carcinogenesis . Similar paradoxical systems have been identified to control T cell turnover / death , EGFR recycling / degradation , both depending on soluble ligand concentrations , or autophagy activation or suppression by EGFR depending on its kinase activity and autophosphorylation levels ( 37 , 50 , 63 , 64 ) . Additionally , our previous studies noted a paradoxical signaling response involving Piezo1 , depending on the force it experiences : cell extrusion and death upon crowding , or rapid cell division after stretch ( 17 , 18 ) . The current study reveals how both EGFR and Piezo1 integrate signaling together to achieve differential outcomes . SFKs activate p38 in response to radiation and to Candida infections to promote survival and infection clearance , respectively , via ligand independent EGFR signaling ( Kim et al . , 2008 ; Nikou et al . , 2022 ) . Our work identifies mechanical forces via Piezo1 as an endogenous activation mechanism of this axis and reinforce the vision of p38 as a general transactivator of EGFR in response to stressors ( antibiotics , anti - cancer drugs , or UV radiation ) , with a pro - survival and regenerative signaling output different from ligand - induced canonical responses ( 47 , 48 , 54 , 55 , 65 ) . Our findings may be relevant for cancer resistance to anti - EGFR therapy . First , approved EGFR neutralizing antibodies or inhibitors target the receptor’s kinase activity . However , transformation and bad prognosis are associated with increased mechanical signaling and expression of Piezo1 , SFKs , p38 , and EGFR but not to EGFR phosphorylation status ( 13 , 16 , 27 , 66 – 71 ) . Second , internalized EGFR has pro - survival functions in cancer cells that are kinase - independent and , thus , unaltered by current tyrosine kinase targeting therapies ( 48 , 64 , 65 , 70 , 72 , 73 ) . It is tempting to hypothesize that increased mechanical signaling via Piezo1 promotes kinase - independent EGFR functions and drives resistance in cancer cells , as cancer cells experience increased mechanical forces at initiation and migration ( 74 – 76 ) . Targeting this mechanism could provide an unmet medical need against kinase inhibitor - resistant tumors , e . g . ~ 50 % of Non - Small Cell Lung Cancers or ~ 80 % of advanced colorectal cancers or ( 70 ) . Our findings may also yield practical uses . Given that artificial YAP activation can de - differentiate cells into lineage - restricted stem cells ( Panciera et al . , 2016 ) and increase organ size ( Camargo et al . , 2007 ) , our findings that Yoda1 activates YAP signaling and cell cycle entry ex vivo suggest a simple method to obtain tissue - specific stem cells in culture or promote tissue growth . Our work identifies Piezo1 as a missing link for mechanically activating EGFR and indicates that this activation adopts a different pathway with different outcomes . Mechanical activation of EGFR requires SFK / p38 kinases and serine phosphorylation , rather than EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation , enzymatically separating these two differential outcomes . Given the roles of mechanics in regeneration , oncogenesis , and the increased prevalence of tyrosine kinase inhibitor chemoresistance , our discovery may reveal insight into EGFR signaling during repair and malignancy . 11 Materials & Methods Unless noted , reagents obtained from ThermoFisher . Cell culture Non - verified HeLa , A549 , and MDCK - II cells were grown in DMEM ( 31966021 ) with 10 % FBS ( 10270106 ) and 1 % Pen / Strep ( 15070063 ) in a cell culture incubator at 37ºC with 5 % CO 2 . For all experiments , cells were seeded in growth medium . After 24h , growth medium was washed twice with PBS ( 14190250 ) and replaced by starvation medium ( DMEM + 1 % Pen / Strep , FBS omitted ) for 24h before cell treatment . All cells tested negative for Mycoplasma contamination in periodic PCR tests ( Sartorius , 20 - 700 - 20 ) . siRNA transfection The day after seeding , 20 % - 40 % confluent cells were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMax ( 13778 ) and OptiMEM ( 31985062 ) following manufacturer’s instructions . siRNA pool ( Horizon Discovery , siControl : D - 001810 - 10 - 50 , siPIEZO1 : L - 020870 - 03 - 0050 , siCHC : L - 004001 - 01 - 0020 ) final concentration was 10nM . siRNA transfection was repeated 24h later . The next day , cells were trypsinized and seeded on glass coverslips in growth medium before starvation overnight and treatment . Chemicals and treatments 24h after serum starvation , cells were treated with DMSO ( 276855 ) , 10µM Yoda1 ( Tocris , 5586 , reconstituted in DMSO ) or 10ng / mL EGF ( Peprotech , 400 - 25 , reconstituted in deionized water ) for indicated durations . Experiments involving inhibitors included a 30 - min pre - treatment with 1µM PD153035 ( Sigma , SML0564 ) , 200nM PP2 ( Sigma , P0042 ) , or 10 µM SB202190 ( Abcam , ab120638 ) , all reconstituted in DMSO . All treatments were prepared recycling starvation medium . Shear stress was delivered to cells seeded on microfluidic chambers ( Ibidi ) using a peristaltic pump ( Fisher Scientific , 16609762 ) with a fluid rate of 4mL of starvation medium per minute , shown used to activate Piezo1 ( 12 ) . Calcium imaging Cells grown on glass coverslips were loaded with 4 . 5 µM of the calcium - sensitive dye Calbryte - 520AM ( AAT Bioquest , 20651 , reconstituted in DMSO ) for 30min in the cell culture incubator ( 37°C , 5 % CO2 ) , followed by washing and 30min of additional incubation for AM cleavage and dye equilibration . Coverslips were then mounted on a recording chamber ( Warner Instruments , 642420 ) and intracellular calcium levels were imaged at RT using a 20x air objective , 2x2 binning , and GFP - compatible epifluorescence settings . Fluobrite DMEM ( A1896701 ) supplemented with 20mM HEPES ( 15630080 ) was used to prepare all solutions . A peristaltic pump connected to the recording chamber exchanged solutions . Western blot Cells were seeded on 10cm culture plates and starved and treated when 60 - 70 % confluent . After treatment , plates were placed on ice , washed twice with ice - cold PBS , and lysed in 250µL / plate of RIPA buffer ( 89901 ) supplemented with EDTA and protease ( 78430 ) and phosphatase ( Merck , 524625 ) inhibitor cocktails . After 1min of incubation on ice , plates were scraped and the lysate placed in tubes , followed by 30 - min incubation in ice , vortexing every 5 minutes . Lysates were then centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 min at 4ºC . The resulting supernatants were placed in new tubes and their protein content quantified with a BCA kit ( 23225 ) . 50µg grams of protein adjusted to 10 µL in RIPA and dying ( B0007 ) buffers were denatured at 95ºC for 10 min , spun down , supplemented with sample reducing buffer ( B0004 ) , and loaded in 4 - 12 % Bis - Tris gels ( NW04120BOX ) . A well with 5 µL of a pre - stained protein standard ( LC5925 ) was used to track protein separation during electrophoresis at 120V for 1 . 5h in MOPS SDS buffer ( B0001 ) . Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( IB23002 ) with a dry transfer device ( IB21001 ) at 25V for 8min . Membranes were blocked for 1h at RT with 5 % BSA ( for phosphorylated targets ) or with 5 % non - fat powder milk .

Antibodies - Staining Primaries : pY1173 - EGFR ( 1 / 250 , R & D Systems , AF1095 ) , pS1046 / 1047 - EGFR ( 1 / 250 , Abcam , ab76300 ) , total EGFR ( 1 / 200 , antibodies . com , A86603 ) , EEA1 ( 1 / 250 , BD , 610457 ) , phospho - ERK ( 1 / 200 , CST , 4370S ) , YAP ( 1 / 200 , SCBT , sc - 101199 ) , phospho - cJUN ( 1 / 200 , Abcam , ab32385 ) , cFOS ( 1 / 200 , SCBT , sc - 166940 ) , Ki67 ( 1 / 100 , Abcam , ab16667 ) . Secondaries : 1 / 250 Alexa Fluor ( AF ) - conjugated 488 Anti - Rabbit ( A11008 ) and 594 Anti - Mouse ( A11005 ) , supplemented with 1 / 500 AF647 Phalloidin ( A22287 ) and 30 μ g / ml Hoechst ( 62249 ) . For mouse lung slices , 1 / 100 antibody dilutions were used . All mixes prepared in 1 % BSA ( A7906 - 100G ) in PBS . Imaging Samples were imaged at 1µm - thick Z displacements through 20X and 40X air and 60X oil objectives of a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 - E microscope with a Yokogawa CSU - W1 spinning disk system coupled to an Andor DU - 888 camera , and a Toptica multi - laser bed . Settings remained unchanged between conditions . Image analysis pY1173 internalization Maximum Intensity Projections were built from raw ND2 files using the Extract Images and Make projections functions of the Process images macro set developed by Christophe Leterrier in Fiji , available at https : / / github . com / cleterrier / Process _ Images . Next , Cell Profiler ( 79 ) was used to sequentially 1 ) segment nuclei using the DNA channel , 2 ) segment cells on the actin channel using nuclei as seeds , 3 ) generate masks of the cytoplasm after shrinking segmented cells to omit cell boundaries , 4 ) enhance speckles in the pY1173 - EGFR image using a feature size of 10 , 5 ) segment speckles for counting , and 6 ) export data . 13 Nuclear translocation of YAP , cFOS , and pJUN Background , intra - , and juxta - nuclear ROIs were manually drawn with Fiji using the mid - height image of each Z - stack . The median intensity value of each ROI was measured and exported to a CSV file later used for background subtraction and Nuclear / Cytoplasmic ratio calculation in RStudio or Excel . Statistics All graphs and statistical analyses were done with Prism 9 . 3 . 1 ( GraphPad Software ) . Data are presented as median±interquartile range . Given that data distribution was not gaussian , the statistical significance of the differences between treatments was assessed with one - way ANOVA followed by Kruskal - Wallis post - hoc test with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons , as suggested by the software . The threshold for statistical significance was p < 0 . 05 . Acknowledgements We thank C . Mulas , M . A . Valverde , and F . X . Real for critical reading of the manuscript , F . Fore , and D . C .
